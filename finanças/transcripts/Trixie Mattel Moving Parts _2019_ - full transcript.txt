- [thunder rumbling] - [rain pattering] Oh, come here, Nick. Look! You wanna know how gay I was? This is me meeting Jessica Rabbit. That's me being really gay. This is me at the Packer Hall of Fame. I'm kneeling with pom-poms. I mean... [laughing] There was no hope for me. Oh, this is me wearing my grandma's high heels... and wearing scrunchies as garters. Which means I not only was gay, I wanted to be like a slut. [whispering] I mean, that's gay. Oh, and there's me looking at my valentines.

[applause and autoharp music continues] [Trixie] My name is Trixie Mattel and I am a comedian and musician who dresses like this. [laughing] [interviewer] Do you feel like you're taken seriously as a performer? [laughing] Um... Well, I think, base level, drag is not taken seriously by anyone, even lovers of drag. But I think as far as... It's sort of like, you can be very serious about being funny, and I'm very serious about, like, drag. [RuPaul's Drag Race opening theme] ['50s beach music plays] Walked in number seven on Season Seven. Look at that. Two fucking $40 wigs pinned together. [Max] Oh... my goodness. [Trixie] Drag queens always say, "Paint for the back row." I paint for the check-cashing place... Listen to my accent! ...down the street. [Minnesota accent] I paint for the back row. The back row. Do you ever go to the back row? My family's Native American and we grew up very, very poor. But Trixie, she has it all. The biggest problem in her life is what to wear the next day. - [judge] You are not standing out for me. - Oh, God. [judge] And I want to see some identity and some flavor and I'm not getting that from you yet. [Michelle Visage] If you're gonna be the comedy queen, you gotta go all the way. Trixie Mattel, you are an amazing queen. Keep on dreamin' and keep 'em laughing. Now, sashay away. Thank you. - [sad music plays] - [Trixie] So triggered. [light applause] Wow. Bye! No corset. [RuPaul] Con-drag-ulations, ladies. And remember, - if you can't love yourself... - [Trixie] Ugh! [RuPaul] ...then how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else? - Nick, I don't wanna watch this. - [RuPaul] Can I get an amen up in here? - [music plays] - [drag contestants] Amen! [Trixie] I did a really shitty job the first time on Drag Race. I never won anything and I went home. When a drag queen is performing and they, like, believe in what they're doing, you can't tell them that they're not legitimately the most beautiful, famous person in the world. And I think at a drag show especially, that is what the audience is there to see. They're there to see this delusional confidence. Oh, God, my first drag was... Actually, it was a pink waitress outfit with a brown beehive. A brown beehive. I know. [exclaims in disgust] And I remember, literally, being in a University of Milwaukee T-shirt with a mop-top of hair, and standing in the mirror in my bathroom and looking at my fishnet leg with the heel and being like, "I'm the most beautiful woman in the world!" [shower running] It's my last pair of clean underwear. I hope you guys like 'em. You're gonna see 'em for a few days. [chuckling] [guitar tuning] My grandpa used to be like, "If you can't tune the guitar without a tuner, you have no business playing it." Which I kinda think is true. [guitar music plays] At 15, I moved in with my grandparents. And my grandpa was a country musician who played guitar, so that's how I got really interested in music when I was like 13 or 14. Sounds good. It never occurred to me to play music in drag, because even though I've been playing guitar, and singing, and writing music for like 15 years, it just didn't... It didn't seem like it would fit with this. It was like, why would Malibu Barbie just sing country music? It doesn't make sense. And so then I started shifting it more like a Woodstock-Dolly Parton, sort of, Emmylou Harris, June Carter Cash. - Okay. - [man] You first need... [Trixie] Someday if I quit drag, I would love to write songs for other people and just, like, live in the woods somewhere and write songs and send 'em out and have people buy 'em. And just sit around and... jerk off. A one, two, three and...

I like that this curtain looks like they're playing at - a shitty, like, talent show at a VFW. - [man 1] Or a high school, yeah. - [man 2] High school auditorium. - Yeah, right. [Trixie] Hi. - Brian? - [driver] Yeah. [Trixie] Well, thank you for helping. I wanted to be a musician and then like two years into studying voice, I was concerned that it wasn't helping me become a better performer. So then I switched to musical theater. You know, when I'm on stage, it's my own thoughts and feelings and then Trixie's sort of like the crash dummy. I can put it all on her and then let it all be a joke and then it's a lot... It's a lot easier, you know. RuPaul always says he's an introvert dressed up like an extrovert. And I always feel like that too, you know. In real life, when there's no cameras or I'm not in drag or anything, I like having a few very close friends that I take really good care of. Like I'm very close with Katya. You know, we work together and we're close, close friends. Hi, everyone. It's me, Trixie Mattel. And I'm Katya. Welcome to... [both] Unh... The show where we talk about... whatever. And in whatever way we want to. - Because it's not your show. - It's ours. [intro music plays] Yeah. I have to tell you, when I met you on Drag Race, I walked up to you and the first thing I thought was, "Her costume's so cool. Her teeth are so big and bright." - And I thought you looked really pretty. - Thank you. Well, first of all, I thought you were part of the crew. - [laughs] Everyone did! - [Katya] When you de-drag... You're on the Internet now, people. We're getting real. [cackles] [Trixie] We became friends on the phone after Drag Race and then we started working together, talking together. I mean, our friendship really grew on camera, so. What? What? What? What? Nothing, I just like you. [cackling] ["Best Friend" by Harry Nilsson plays] [Trixie] It worked for the first five or six, ten episodes... and then when we figured out what we were doing, then it really worked. [Katya] Ooh. The show where we talk about whatever we want. [spooky voice] 'Cause it's our show. - And not yours. - Halloween edition. [evil laughter] [Trixie] And then, like, 35 episodes in, World of Wonder was like, "We think your show would be a good TV show," and Katya and I were like... "Yeah, we'll believe it when we see it." [rock introduction music to The Trixie &amp; Katya Show plays] [laughing] What about this? "Hey, guys, I got a joke for you. What did I say after my dad fucked me for 17 years? - Nothing." - [screams and laughs] - [man] Atta girl. - Atta girl. [Trixie] I know. Do you know that you're probably one of the best comedy writers working in Los Angeles right now? - [laughing] - It's not a joke. Don't, you'll make my Invisalign fall out. - I'm not joking. - [Fena] You're wearing Invisalign. Thank you. I think that's funny. Thank you. You're like... No, I take it... I appreciate it. I don't know how to take a compliment. [Katya] Apparently, 'cause you laugh. Well... I just... I thank you. - [Katya] Okay, yeah. - [stammers] I think my jokes are funny. We just flipped. I don't do comedy. You know I actually never do comedy. I'm not a comedian, at all. I think you're a natural comedian. No, I'm not a comedian. I do not tr... What I say sounds funny 'cause I'm nuts. You are a co-me-dian. I think we just attack differently. No! You're a comedian. - I set up the obstacle course... - [Katya] You... No. - ...and then run it. - Momma, no. Let me break it down for you. - I'm seven years older than you... - Almost eight. [laughter] [Fena] How's the new album? [Trixie] It's good. I think the songs are better than the other one. - [Fena] Well, couldn't get much worse! - [Trixie cackles] [background chatter] Can I give you your present here... - later? - What is it? - It's the doll. - [gasps] You brought it. The doll. [dramatically] The doll! [Trixie] Oh... what! Whoa. And look at the little Katya. Oh, my God. [laughing] [Katya] "My dearest, darling doll. You've grown so very tall. And now it's perfectly clear who is now Roxxxy." "So I'll keep it foxy at The Troxy without Oxy 'cause two in one is greater than none." [Katya] The Troxy is the venue in London I'm doing the one-woman show at, and Oxy's OxyContin. Drugs. Drugs. Oh, so you're saying I'm gonna keep it together at my show without chemicals... 'Cause two in one is greater than none. - And that's us. - Yeah! - That's very sweet. - Thank you! I wrote it. I'm not sure if writing's for you, but... [Katya cackles] But the sentiment is really nice. - [Trixie] How are you feeling? - [Katya] I don't know. I need to laugh, not cry. [Trixie] Listen, you know what would make you be in a great mood? Doing tons of drugs, and you're not. So you're a wonderful legend. Are you happier going to those stupid meetings or do you hate them with every part of your being? No, I just can't stop crying in them. Oh. I go and have a... I just cry from start to finish. Maybe that's not bad though. No, it is good. It's just team too much. Yeah. It's emotionally exhausting. And then I can't do work after that, do you know what I mean? Like, I'm going to literally just reach for speed which is euphoria. - Yeah... totally. - And medicate myself, momma. - Yeah. - It's not good. Yeah. [Katya exclaiming] Yeah? Oh, thank you. [Trixie] "Oh, thank you." [background chatter] [Katya] Trixie, what is your ETA for being done? - Five. - [claps] But if you're not ready in five, it's not like gonna ruin my life. [Katya] Can you be more specific about how much time you think I should have? [Trixie] I would like you to be ready in five. I think that I'm the most beautiful famous person in the world. Do you care to weigh in on that, Fena? [Fena] "Famous"? Hey, we all have butts, which makes butts - a billion-dollar industry. - That's right. So let's review some butt-oriented products in a bit we call Two Thumbs Up... Your Butt? First up, we have the Butt Out II. Let me tell you what this is. - I think I know. - What? This is something to retrieve a condom from the anus. - [cackles] - It's not? Who uses a condom? And that was "I Wanna Sext You Up." [Valley girl voice] Oh, my God. [director] We have a little... we have some gas left to do... Go, go! - [director] Go... - Please. Yes. - [Darren] Let's do it. - Please. I'm sorry to yell... - I'm sorry to yell. - [director] So this is a game called Trump or Troll. - You can yell. - Okay, good. Yeah, let's go. [director] Basically, there are Tweets and... - I will not do that. - [director] Okay. - Go take a break. - Okay. I will take this section on myself. [Katya whispering] I'm so sorry, Thairin. I'm sorry. [Trixie] Oh, it's like fully white. Yeah, white-tipped mascara. I... Please stop. Katya, when I say "Who's a superstar?" You say, "I am." Who's a superstar? - [Katya] I am. - [Trixie] See? You said it so angry. - [angrily] Drag is fierce and fun. - [Trixie cackles] Girl, you look beautiful... if that matters. [background chatter] [Trixie] Is my headband okay? Yeah, right? Wait, oh, can I ask you a question that's... Are we allowed to say whatever we want? [man] Yeah. Always. I will... The only word that... But the only thing is, I need to know what is off the table in terms of my... I cannot... I'm having a hard time restraining myself because I don't wanna lose touch with reality because I had a psychotic break, and it's really fucking stressing me out. I am absolutely about to unravel and that's not funny to me. I'm on the verge of crying in every fucking moment because I need to go to a meeting and I can't, and I need to quit this show, but I won't do it, - because she's my friend... - [Trixie] Um, let's just take a break. [man] Absolutely. So anything you need, you just tell us. Yeah... yeah, thank you. [background chatter] [Katya] I'm exhausted! All right. [Trixie] She can just say, "I need a break" whenever she wants. We're not like... We're not... I don't think she likes to talk to me. I'm gonna go talk to her. [Katya] I just can't talk right now. And it's nothing personal. I don't understand what it is. [Trixie] I can't tell what's helpful. [Katya] I don't know what's helpful, all I know is that... I should be in rehab. It's just stressful. - I don't think it's help... - [man] How are you? I'm okay except... [nervous laughter] You know, I try not to be... You know, it's our whole... It's our whole career. But, um, you know. Nobody's gonna want to see me without her. So... it's the whole point, is that... I just want it to be fun. It used to be a lot more fun. It's so hard to go in there and be funny when it's like... I can see in her irises that she's panicking and wants to leave, do you know what I mean? But I did not get in full drag, and a corset, and nails for somebody to walk in there and leave. This is me. Look, right, this is Katya. She's very acrobatic, though. She can do this. I remember being young and looking at their hair, these McDonald's Barbies, and I thought the way that the hair was solid plastic was the prettiest... thing in the world. Like, it's more like a helmet. It's not real hair. I just wanted to be more patient. And then the more angry I got, the more I felt bad that I was like, "Ugh. She's going through a horrible time and all I am is angry." In this situation, it's selfish to be angry at someone when it's not their fault. It's like... she does not wanna be riding this rollercoaster she's on, but... You know, today was scary. It was like, really scary. She's never been like that. It's gonna really hurt... You know, it's gonna hurt us both. It's gonna hurt us both individually, and it's probably gonna ruin our friendship. [sighs] [guitar music plays] God fucking damn it. Well, what does a good friend do in this situation? Stop going to work completely, you know what I mean? I want people to... think of me as Trixie, and not "Trixie and Katya" now because... I think I have a lot of value as a performer even without what was originally advertised. [RuPaul reading] Are you ready to go for the gold? My most legendary queens return to battle for the crown. It's All-Star season! Snatching trophies? [laughing] I am a trophy. Bring it! RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. [Trixie] To me, I felt like I had nothing to lose because I didn't do good the first time. I have nothing to live up to. But my career, I feel like I have to live up to that, so even though I had no Drag Race pressure, I feel like the fans I have I really had to try and do a good job so they weren't disappointed in me. I'm looking for a friend. Where is my friend? It's been a hard week. I'm just here to have a good time. This press tour should be like the easiest part of the week, I think. I mean, I'm bringing new eyelashes out so people can't say I didn't try. I'm also hoping in this press tour nobody asks about Katya, 'cause I don't have an answer for them. [knock on door] - [doorbell ringing] - [gasps] [Southern accent] There's a transgender in the bathroom! [gasping] [whispering] Fucking weirdo. [Trixie] Well, I don't wanna make people uncomfortable. I was always interested in... like remember in the '90s, remember those Maury Povich kinda shows where it's like... [mimicking Maury Povich] "You have to guess if it's a man or a woman." And obviously, it's horrible, but I remember being little and being like... so into it. I thought they were so pretty. [laughs] I sort of liked the audience reactions. Like... [mimicking Povich] "We got a question from Terry." [nasally] "Hi, my name's Terry from North Dakota, and just, you guys... Just, you guys have just, like, better legs than I do." You know, like, shit like that. You know I have a friend who... She's a transgender girl and then... she does drag, though. She'll do like, the Grinch. She'll do like, full body transformations. I like all kinds of drag. My favorite... I love woman drag queens. I like drag queens that are, in drag, basically women. I think it's magical. I think it's 'cause we like what we can't do and obviously I can't do that, but... I don't wanna look like a woman, I wanna look like a thing. I wanna look like a thing that you could pull a string on the back, you know what I mean, and have it talk. I remember I was in a performance once. There was like a traveling group that did opera at like elementary schools. And I wanted to be in it so bad. And I got to be in it, and I played a fucking wolf. Literally wore like a shitty wolf costume and then some other girl got to be the golden harp. And it was... I had a manifestation of jealousy so deep inside me that I was ill. And I threw up at school. But no. I'm not competitive. [phone ringing] I guess I just like to dress up. [deep voice] Hello? [man] Good morning, sir. I'm so sorry. This is from room service. - You ordered breakfast, right? - Yes. Okay, we have a small problem. We cannot post it to your room. Like, we cannot charge it to your room, sir. So you have to be paying cash or credit card. Okay. So I'll send it to my guy, okay? Okay. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - Bye. It's room service. He says hi. Um, listen. Let's go to the premiere party of my TV show. [country music plays] You guys, Thorgy said she's taking an Uber. Let's go. [Morgan] Our gig together was a lot of fun though. No, it was good. A stage like that exposes me as a terrible... like, lip-syncer. - Bullshit. - It's true. - No. - You stage dived, and I had to go after you. But you're also Trixie. [laughing] That means I have a lot to lose. [Morgan] Mmm-mmm. [Trixie] I like a drag queen that's just... hooker. Like smoking, walking like this is her street. I love that. Where's the booze? Where's the booze? [gasps] Oh, Kennedy has wine. [music continues] Okay, good. - Is that for Us Weekly? - [man] Yeah. I am who I am, okay? [interviewer] So what does it mean to you to be back for All Stars 3? You have a second chance. When I walked into that workroom, I just... my asshole clenched up. I started sweating. My mind was racing. It's sort of like when you were bullied in high school, and then you go back for a reunion and you see your bully and you're like... My single comes out next Thursday - on the night of All Stars premiere. - Very exciting. And then my new album One Stone comes out the end of the season. And as the only drag queen folk musician, that might make me the best drag queen folk musician? But Dolly Parton might count as a drag queen. - I think she does, honestly. - So I don't know... Yeah, exactly. [interviewer] Now of course I have to ask you, a lot of fans are freaking out over this Katya moment. [Trixie] Oh, yeah. I'll just say this. Mental health and sobriety is not a straight line. And Drag Race is a family and we support our family members. I am Katya's friend first and her business partner second. No matter what goes on with Trixie or Katya, we will laugh through all of it. You know, I've been making Katya jokes all day. Everybody just wanted to talk about Katya. Well, actually, I was asked one question about that, but it was actually very well done. [Trixie] Was it, like, "How do you balance the..." They were like... uh, God. What'd they say, exactly? They were just asking me, like, my thoughts on... They said, "Why do you look like that?" Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I was like, "It's a mental health issue." [laughing] People don't feel like they can draw boundaries anymore. That's what I said... People, in general, all feel like they should have access to you at every moment, no matter what. And for her to just be like, "You don't have access to me anymore. It's not you. I just need that. - Okay, bye." - Yeah, totally. Like, that's a really important thing I think for, like, people to hear and... [Kennedy] And they also need to know that it's not just her, we've all battled with something. - Yeah. - Exactly. You know, I told them I've battled with, um, depression all my life. You know, was admitted and everything, a few times. Yeah. - So it's not just about her. - Yeah. You know, everybody goes through something. So don't make it seem like it's just... Yeah, except we have to make an environment where she doesn't have to feel bad saying it. - [Kennedy] Yeah... that's what I'm saying. - [BenDeLaCreme] Well, also it's... - [Kennedy] Well, I been through it too... - Yeah. - We all have our moments in life... - Yeah. ...where you know, you just have that moment. [Stephanie] We're calling the cars. - They should be already here. - [BenDeLaCreme] Thank you so much. [Kennedy] Stephanie, that is not acceptable. How is it unacceptable if they're already here? - [Kennedy] Oh, they are? Okay. - [Stephanie] Uh-huh. - Oh, don't get smart. - [laughter] Stephanie, that's not acceptable. Stephanie, don't get smart. I love that you put on your "Let me talk to the manager" voice for that. [man] Please don't tell me... you're one of those characters on Spike? This lady here, her and her compadre on Viceland? Oh, that's me. Yeah, that's why I was asking you. - Oh, yeah, that's me. - Oh, you guys are a trip! Yeah, that's me. Oh, wow. Here, my name is Taylor. - I love your show. - Thank you. - This is amazing. - Thank you, thank you. - [laughing] - That's so crazy. I was like, damn, I can't tell anything. And then your make... I mean, you guys are just so frickin' natural and I don't know how long you guys been doing that, - but... But... - Well, thank you. You know what? Normally, nobody recognizes you out of drag so you're like... No, I wouldn't. I'm just saying... there's no way. I can't even tell! [autoharp music plays] [man] Do you want any food or drinks, guys? Oh, just a glass of wine on stage. A glass of white wine on stage. Ah... just a bottle of like, Pinot Grigio. [music continues] Oh, my God, it's so hot in here. Ooh! Oh, my God, I feel so pretty. I used to not like hoops 'cause I thought that they were too slutty, but now that's kinda why I like them. Oh. Duh. Oh, that's fun. You know, normal women. They just have Muppet hands. You know? Hi, everyone, what a beautiful audience. Isn't it amazing to be in a room full of people and still feel so alone. Glad you guys laughed at that, this would have been a long night. I said that joke during rehearsal and there was no one here to laugh at it. And I was just yelling into an empty audience. I felt like I was performing at graduation at Columbine High. Oh, did you guys go to Columbine? Well, you're here, so, no, you didn't. Just shoot me.

You're not the ugly part. - Thank you. - I'm a faggot. But... I talked to her recently and she said she was happy with it. And it's people like you that made me believe in myself. - So thank you. - Of course. - Can I have a hug? - Of course. You should've told me to brace myself for that emotional... - Thank you... thank you. - Brace yourself... Nevermind. - Thank you. - It's okay. - I'll see you later, okay? - Thank you.

And I have issues with anxiety and depression and things like that, but she's helped me gain more confidence and get through that, a lot. And just by making me laugh. And with Katya as well, the pair of them have just helped me so much with everything. And it's just like... You think back and you... People say, "Oh, they're only people." And like, no, they're not. They actually mean something to us, you know. She's affected my life in so many different ways that I don't know if she understands herself. Like, I'm so much more confident than I was in first year. Like when I first started university, I didn't even want to be gay. - But now, I don't even wanna be straight. - Now you embrace it. I'm just so happy with who I am. And that's Trixie.

It sucks to be on TV again and be critiqued by people again. And Trixie and Katya being, like, totally fucked up right now. It was just lots of reasons... all of a sudden, I felt really bad. And then I guess I also like... Normally I don't give a fuck, but maybe because of All Stars I feel like I really need to go out there and kill it, you know?

[BenDeLaCreme] Shangela, you have come so far. Initially, your makeup was kinda busted, your outfits were a mess, and your personality was super grating, but look how far you've come now. - You are much older. - [laughter] Trixie. Now, a lot of people clock your makeup, but I totally get it. You know, you're just painting for the back of the room. Which makes sense, because that's where your audience collects - if you remember to lock the door. - [laughter] And, Bebe. I hear that this is the year that you might get two crowns. Which is really not a lot of dental work as far as those early seasons - are concerned. - [laughter] [RuPaul] This week, I challenged my All Stars in an All Star Variety Show. Gentleman, start your engines, and may the best All Star win! [applause] Up next, the musical stylings of Trixie Mattel.

Like, if I was at home while All Stars was on right now, I think I would be freakin' out more. Because we're over here, it sort of just feels like it's happening somewhere else in the world. It's not really happening to us. [singing] Overpriced? I think so. I won that on Drag Race, actually. I don't know, I think it's just like poor-people mentality. Even if I had that kind of money, it would still give me like full-blown heart attacks to spend money like that. [music plays] Yeah, you know, we were really poor. I didn't know anything about the rest of the world. My brother's five years older than me and my sisters are ten years younger. We weren't really close. We couldn't be more different. My brother's an attorney and, like, a three-time Iraq war veteran. He actually watches my TV shows and stuff now, though. [plucks strings to tune] Well, tonight's a huge show. It's like 800 people in the first show, and then 400 other people. That's like, 1,200 people in the city of Manchester coming to see me. [cell phone chimes] [man] And you know what, I'm gonna put her on stage with eight people. And it's gonna be a money loss for me, but I'm gonna have to just... What? Nothing. What? No. Katya... he just sent me a message that said, "You do realize that what I gave you... that doll was a voodoo doll, right? You're about to kill your whole career. That episode was awful for you. What the fuck is wrong with you? You're boring and arrogant, the only two sins on television. Did anyone teach you anything? What the fuck did Alaska tell you to do? Do what I did, bitch, fail." I can't believe she just said that. It's like, why would you take this moment in someone's life and try to, like, ruin it? I don't know where the switch flipped. I don't... I have no idea where, like... how that happens. I don't know what she's getting out of this. Where she's got this, like, weird hostility. I have no idea. I don't know where it came from. People keep giving me Katya things, like pictures of us together and clothes with both of us on it and stuff, and like... it's so awkward. For me, not for them. They don't know. I just can't believe she said that. [cheering and applause] This song is currently number one on the singer/songwriter charts. [cheering continues] Just to fucking go to show you that the world is so mixed up, that a crossdresser can play an autoharp - and sell it, and people buy it! - [laughter and cheering] ["Moving Parts" by Trixie Mattel plays] [singing] ♪ Living's supposed to kill you ♪ ♪ But it shouldn't feel like dying ♪ ♪ Loving's supposed to fill you ♪ ♪ But it spills you like your wine ♪ ♪ And all the paper people ♪ ♪ Wandering about ♪ ♪ Wondering who made them ♪ ♪ And who's gonna cut them out ♪ ♪ Sometimes there's a danger Of choking on the parts ♪ ♪ No one gave a warning To the breaking of your heart ♪ ♪ Pick up all the pieces And go back to the start ♪ ♪ Never losing, only using All your moving parts ♪ ♪ All your moving parts ♪ - You guys wanna see some shit? - [crowd cheering] [music continues] [cheering] Hi. This is a serious part. [laughs] Oh, my God, it's my Christmas card to my mom, I forgot to give her. Here's my stun gun, but I don't know how to work it. Oh! Keychain. I'm into that. Honey. I get a lotta honey. I guess we'll keep that. Oh! Excuse me. That's amazing. We're keeping that. What if I was going through a breakup and I was processing all that hurt and anger, and I worked at your local Starbucks? "Caramel macchiato, what's your name? Little Piss Bitch? Little Piss Bitch?" [laughing] This person's seen the show a few times. Look, they even wrote the joke on here. That's amazing. Is this a reusable cup? Oh, this is fierce. I'm keeping this. That is amazing. This person made me a book for the UK tour of "Moving Parts" with sketches of all my costumes in the show. I wonder how long this took the person. Or maybe they're really fast. I could never draw this. Look at that. "It's a huge motivator for me. I used to be in a similar situation to what you've gone through, and how you express things through humor is amazing. You've been a massive help to me. I'll often binge-watch videos, re-watch your videos or most often listen to your music, especially if I've had a bad day." I can't read all these. "Six months ago I decided I wanted to end my life." Do you see what I mean? They always wanna kill themselves. "I would've died on my bedroom floor. You saved me." Wow. It's very intense. You know, for some reason, I really resonate with people who have depression. I don't know... People are always like, "I'm so happy you're open about your depression." But I'm not depressed, so I don't know. I mean, I make jokes about being sad. But I'm also not a sad person, so. How could I be sad when I get gifts like this? [imitates radio DJ] Well, waking up in the morning with Trixie Mattel, we're good on the I-5, good for traffic. It's a beautiful, sunny day in Los Angeles. [mimics laser gun] [DJ 1 laughing] You do our job, but way better. [DJ 2] Thanks so much for being on the show and giving us some time. [DJ 1] I bet you there are people that are curious, and so I'll just ask you, what's the percentage of people that dress in drag - that are homosexual... - Yeah. [DJ 1] ...compared to straight? Well, I think if you think about what drag is and you think about maybe you've been seeing it the whole time. I mean, Mrs. Doubtfire, Madea, Dana Carvey in Church Lady. [DJ 1] I wanna ask you something that, maybe... I don't wanna bring the whole room down, but I was reading about you and it said you actually got your name Trixie from your abusive stepfather who used to call you that when you were acting feminine. And... is that true? Yes, it is. And we're waking up here with Trixie Mattel on the morning in Los Angeles. [mimics laser gun] [DJs laughing] You didn't wanna bring the room down. I'm trying to bring it back up. [laughs] [DJ 1] No, I appreciate that. Is this guy still around and does he know that his lame attempt to humiliate you for being yourself is now, you've flipped it on him and now you're cashing in and making more money than said abusive stepfather? Oh, no, I'll do you one better. He passed away of alcoholism. [mimics drum playing] - [DJs] Aw. - [DJ mimics laser gun] Pew, pew... yeah. I grew up in northeast Wisconsin with my mom and my brother. And then, my mom always had like a... cycling, recurring cast of characters as her boyfriends. And then she married when I was like ten, to my stepdad. I can't remember the first time... it happened. But I can remember the last time it happened. The last time it happened, he was hitting me and I was... So I went to my room, and he was really drunk and he came with a gun. And I remember that was... That was the last time it happened. And he pointed a loaded gun at me and he said he was gonna kill me. And I remember that was the last time it happened because... I think I told one of my friends about it, maybe that week. And by the next week, the counselor talked to me and told me that they had to take me out of my home. I don't know, I mean, it's weird to think now that I just moved out, and as a mom, that was just an option. Like she was just like, "All right, bye." You know? That's so crazy to me, but... I remember at the time, I just... I never blamed her. I don't know, I think abuse happens so slowly and so deeply that... when you're in it, I just think that's what you think is normal. I thought everyone's family was like that. I thought everyone went home every day and just wanted to die. And I also feel like every year of my life has gotten progressively better. It doesn't really have to do with drag or money or success, it just has to do with like, the more you fabricate your own life, you get to live, the happier you are. [birds chirping] - Katya called me yesterday. - [woman] Oh. - Yeah. That was a surprise. - [woman] What'd she say? She's at, like, an inpatient place. It was nice that she was at least somewhere where they're clearly taking care of her. She's only allowed to talk on the phone 15 minutes, you know. People are like, "I'm such a fan. I want Katya to get better. But also I don't accept that she's not at work right now." - [woman laughs] Yeah. - Okay. - Do I get to keep this dress? - [woman] Yeah, it's for you. I'm not gonna fit it. [laughs] [Trixie] Hold this. [man] Oh, you want me to hold... the petticoat too? [Trixie] Yeah. Oh, cookies. Thin Mints, bitch! From a real Girl Scout. [man] They're all my favorite, though. Caramel DeLites. [Trixie] It's this type of precision that matters in a photoshoot environment. [woman] Darling, it's the one percent difference. [Trixie] Devil's in the details. [background chatter] [man] ...put the stockings on so that her other leg would show. - [woman] What? - [man] You put the stockings on... [autoharp music plays] [Trixie] Today is probably the last day of filming... I would say, ever. We're just trying to hot-glue together a version of the last few episodes that isn't so fucked up. [intro music to The Trixie &amp; Katya Show plays] [Trixie] The Glendale Community Bayside Players Theatre presents The Trixie &amp; Katya Show. In the role of Katya will be Bob the Drag Queen. [applause] Welcome to our show! I'm the stranger who knocked off your glasses and said, "Let me be your eyes," Trixie Mattel. I'm the difference between knowing your shit and knowing you are shit, Bob the Drag Queen. Every week we take one topic, slice it open, spread its entrails on the floor and read it like a shaman in the bush! [man] Good luck. - [Bob] I know, right? - [Trixie] Thank you for everything, guys. Don't do drugs. Bye. [Bob] You know, I was recently approached by these people for something like an antibullying campaign... It's telling kids not to do any drugs. I don't even drink. So I'm not... So I don't wanna be like, "Hey, no one do drugs." [Trixie] I don't even do weed. Really? Like ever? Latrice gave me like two pumps once, and it was terrifying. [singing indistinctly] What a day. It was just a weird, bittersweet feeling because... it's like we're wrapping the Trixie &amp; Katya Show and Katya is somewhere... Quit drag. Today, I just kept having moments of like, we're finishing this without her. That's just like crazy, you know what I mean? [autoharp music playing] [Trixie singing indistinctly] Ugh, I didn't know it was gonna rain. Fuck. [autoharp music continues] [club music plays] She brought the rain! She brought the rain. - You guys excited? - [crowd cheering] This evening seems like the odds were stacked against me, but... good things happen to just okay people. So... - Let's get fucked up, bye! - [crowd cheers] It's on, it's on. Everybody shut up, it's on! Gentlemen, start your engines and may the best All Star win! Hi, everybody. Clap for RuPaul, clap for RuPaul. - [crowd cheers] - Clap, clap, clap, clap. DeLa, which of your All Star teammates have you chosen to get the chop? [dramatic music plays] This is the easiest choice that I have had to make this entire season. [dramatic music continues] I'm going home. - What? - [crowd cheers] [whispering] What did she just say? Did she just say her own name? [screaming] Can't believe Drag Race is concluding pretty soon. People are like, mad at me. They're like, "She's disappointing!" Do you know how hard it is to even be safe on Drag Race? - [Fena] Exactly. - I'm on the last episode, like the top four. - [Fena] Some girl was bitching about... - They were bitching about me? Among other people. She was talking about the show, she's like, "Well, I feel like Trixie's just dropping the ball," and I was like, "Well, I don't think you're really giving anybody a chance here." And then I went into the whole like, "Do you have any idea what we did 15 days before she went on the show? For 12 hours a day, for like weeks beforehand, up until the day she had to leave, we were working for 12 hours a day, in drag, shooting Trixie &amp; Katya." - Yeah. - "And then she had to go on a show." Also, safe is not dropping the ball. Everybody wants to weigh in. I mean, I'm excited for Drag Race to be over 'cause I hate being... I really hate being evaluated by people who are... Jinkx Monsoon says it correctly, "Watching Drag Race doesn't make you an expert on drag. It makes you a fan of a TV show." - Yeah. - Bitch! [slams table] That was... That was her. When I watch Drag Race, I like the conflama as much as I like the drag. But Ben wanted it to be like the Olympics, just a competition. And it's not really like that. And if it was, it would be boring to watch. This is all men's clothes that go to Goodwill. [Trixie grunts] I don't know if I'm gonna win because they filmed both of us winning, but they also filmed a tie and so... I don't really know who wins. I just want it to be over. It's gonna be over in... how many hours? [squeals] And I gotta think of what I'm gonna say if I lose that is authentic, but not... I don't wanna seem disappointed, but I will be. You think if I win $100,000 I can get some new razors? I just wanna know. Do you know what I mean? [man] What do you think is gonna happen? Uh, I think... I think I'm gonna win. I'm upset that, of all days, this eye-makeup thing is happening but... You know, what else am I gonna do? Like, this is kinda plain. I wish I would've had something over this, but it's okay. Well, maybe I'll lose and it won't matter. Okay. I just would've loved to have more time to pin this hair in and... I wish I would've brought a back-up costume, but... it doesn't matter. Nope, we're gonna go straight. - [driver] Straight? - Yep. [driver] Okay. Yep, and we're gonna get out right here. This is the entrance. I promise. Thanks. Oh, my God. - [phone chimes] - Oh, my God. Fuck. [crowd cheering] [announcer] And your fourth-place winner, Trixie Mattel! [crowd cheering] [RuPaul] The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars receives a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics, a coveted spot in the Drag Race Hall of Fame, and a cash prize of $100,000.

It really is the pinnacle of my career, doing the show and being a launchpad for all of you, and I couldn't be more proud right now. Ladies, I have made my decision. The queen who has earned her spot in the Drag Race Hall of Fame, - the champion of All Stars 3 is... - [suspenseful music playing] - Trixie Mattel. - [crowd cheers loudly] ["Champion" by RuPaul plays] [Trixie exclaiming indistinctly] [RuPaul] My queen. Is there anything you'd like to say? [Trixie] I know you guys are looking for somebody who can carry a legacy, and as an All Star, I feel like I've been carrying that legacy since I left the first time. [autoharp music plays] I can't believe it. It feels like it didn't happen. Honestly, this is gay world, though. You win a major award, and you go back to your little dressing room. [exhales deeply] [whispers] I can't believe that happened. [cackles] - [T Rex] Congratulations, I love you. - Thank you, I can't believe it. Gay for it. I was crying during the whole show, but when you were crowned, I just went into full ice, like... [shaky voice] I don't know what to do... I'm freaking out. No, I had like minor tears during the "Kitty Girl" performance, 'cause, like, this is so cool. - I really couldn't believe it. - [T Rex exclaims] Well, they filmed a tie. I thought it would've been a tie. - They filmed a tie? - Yeah. When they filmed the tie, I was like, "I think it's gonna be a tie." Hey, David, can you take a Boomerang for me? - [David] Sure. - It's for the yearbook. I can't believe I just won. I can't believe I just won Drag Race. [indistinct chatter] I'm gonna walk backwards. Take a picture. Bye, guys. I did that. [indistinct chatter] Oh, thank you. I can't believe it. I'm dying. Thank you, sweetheart. Oh, my taxi's here, you guys. I'm sorry. I'll see you guys later. Bye! I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. [man] It was amazing. You know, I've been eliminated from Drag Race twice at viewing parties, and it is quite a different experience winning. [excited laughter] It is quite a fucking different experience. I don't have a lot of interest in putting on costumes right now. If I didn't win, I would still be standing here rifling through a costume parade of shit that's all wrinkled and dirty, trying to figure out what's the least offensive to wear. So nothing's really changed. [mimicking Lady Bunny] Keep your hennies close and your henemies closer. [Trixie chuckles] I hope you die. [exclaims] Drag is so stupid until the last ten seconds - and then I'm like, yes! - [Jinkx] I know. We look like shit until the last ten... Until the last eight seconds and then we're like, "Oh, bitch!" [Jinkx] All comes together. [Trixie] That hair is in fabulous shape. Thanks, I just had it washed and reset. - Oh, did you? - [Jinkx] Yes. [Trixie] God, I'm stunning. It's uncomfortable, actually. Like it's sick. It's gross. [Jinkx] Well, I'm glad winning didn't go to your head. It's not the same as winning the Olympics, you know what I mean. [Jinkx] Yeah. You should be happy you won and you should be proud, but it shouldn't be like... I don't think anybody who wins probably feels better than everyone else. - [Jinkx] No. - You know what I mean? You don't feel like you're better... [Jinkx] Well, we have constant reminders that there's... You know, as soon as you win, then there's another season about to come out. Yeah. I mean, I was sandwiched in between two of the most influential winners ever to come out of the show. - Sharon and Bianca. - Yeah. That's right, didn't even think about that. [Jinkx] So I never felt like I ever had the moment - of feeling like Queen Poop, you know? - Yeah. Cheers? Oh... no cheers. We just... Okay. [cackles] That made it worse. I don't feel lucky, I feel unlucky now. At my house, grew up whenever we take a shot we go... - [slurping] I can stop anytime I want to. - [Jinkx laughing] And then my dad would throw the bottle across the room. [announcer] And the winner of All Stars 3, - give it up for Trixie Mattel! - [crowd cheers] Trixie's win was a little bit like Trump's win, wasn't it? [crowd laughs] I mean, she got the crown, but she did not get the popular vote. [crowd laughs and applauds] Halleloo.

[Trixie] My mom has all the money problems. [automated voice] ...press one. To pay a different amount, press two. - God, this is so dramatic to pay a bill. - [phone beeping] No wonder people don't pay their bills. To authorize and continue, press one. All right. Hold on while I process your payment. [music plays] We're all set. - [Trixie's mom] Hello? - Hi, Mom. [Trixie's mom] Hi, Brian. Hey, I just called WPS and paid that bill. - Oh, did you really? - Yeah, it was up to 14-something. It's like $1,420, so I paid $1,450, so it should be even a couple dollars over. Well, thank you so much, Brian. I'm just struggling here and I hate even asking you, 'cause I feel like I'm being, you know... biggest little loser. No, it's okay. Do you still need a car? I do. I gotta figure out something with that too, but... That's what I told Dez, when I did need a car there was cars for sale all over the place, except now. That's all right. So how's things been going? It's fine. We start the tour tomorrow, so my musician, my opener and my assistant just got here. And we had rehearsal on Sunday, so we set up the whole set and everything. It's pretty cool. It's pink, like, hippie background with giant white glitter letters that are like ten feet tall that say "Trixie" on stage. With like a pink carpet and pink microphone stand and everything. So is that going from each venue, then? Yeah, the whole set will break down every night and travel to all 40 venues. So is that what you'll have in Milwaukee, then too? Yeah, that's what I'll have in Milwaukee. You better come. Well, Sam wants to come and I'm just trying to figure it out. - I'll still have to work and... - Just take off work. I'll pay for you. I can get you tickets and I'll put you up. Just take off work. I suppose I better get off the phone here, because I am at work and... Okay, I'll talk to you later. But make sure you take time off to come to Milwaukee. - All right. - Okay, bye. I'll figure out what I can do. - I love you, bye. - Bye.

[laughter on video] Just like someone's Muggle wife. [laughter] Just like, in a banana clip and Crocs... [laughter] ...bent over a laundry basket. [nasally] "Are we doing it?" - [nasally moan] - [laughter] And there's all these articles for husbands like, "Husbands, How to Spice it Up in the Bedroom."

And I was like, "Yes, I'm a normal person with a normal life. Thank you so much for asking."

Thank you, guys. - I'm so happy to be home. - [crowd cheers] I'm very happy to be home, very happy to be here. This is a new show. My old show was called Trixie Mattel: Ages 3 and Up. I did it at Comedy Cafe last year. - Did you guys see it? Okay. - [crowd cheers] That show was called Trixie Mattel: Ages 3 and Up, which turns out, for my family audiences, - little confusing. - [laughter] I'm up here talking about rimming my dad - and there's kids like right here. - [laughter] - Hey, Mom. - [laughter] No, just kidding. [cackles] You know, family, you gotta love 'em, so... [laughter] Oh, God! Right now, huh? - Hi, Mom. - [Trixie's mom] Hi, hon. [Trixie] I'm so sweaty, sorry. Thank you guys for coming. Oh, thank you for having us. You were on time, I don't know. I said, "If he makes any reference to his family being late, all three of us are gonna stand up and say, - 'We were early!'" - [laughing] [Trixie] "We were here." This is my mom. This is my aunt. And then my sister is taking a huge deuce, yeah. - We all have to use the... - Brandon... Hi, yes, I've seen Brandon online. [Trixie] Are you mortified? No, no. Like, some of the references I don't get because - I'm just not in that lifestyle, but... - [Trixie cackles] But everybody's laughing, so it's gotta be good. Even Auntie doesn't get 'em and she's in the lifestyle. - Thank you for coming. - You look... Oh, thank you for inviting us. Is it weird to see everybody watching? No, but I cried when you first came on. - You did? - Yes. I had tears coming down my face. - Oh my gosh. - I've never seen you before, you know, do your thing. I've seen you on the Internet, on TV. I know, they were like, "Are you gonna change any of your jokes 'cause your mom's here?" I was like, "Let's just do it the same." [cackles] If I take out all the vulgar jokes, I'd have a ten-minute show. [man] Ready and one, two, big smile, three. And one more. One, two and three. - Got it. Thank you, guys. - Awesome. It is funny. - It's filthy, but... - So what? - Grandpa was filthier. - Oh, yeah. finding out they're Native American the next day... [laughter] - That spoke to you guys. - [laughter] - I felt it right here... - Yes! - Baby, I felt it. - [laughter] Well, our grandma used to call it, "blond-haired, blue-eyed Indians." People who find out they're like, this much, and they're like full braids. [laughter] [Trixie's mom] And thank you so much. I enjoyed myself very much. The best. - Awesome. - [Trixie] Thank you. Keep doing what you're doing, you're... You're holding onto me a little tight there, buddy! Well, listen, I was just trying to save enough money for when we have to send you to rehab, okay.

We all know that's not a woman. But that person is believing it, and that's what's addicting to watch. Feels like you've been here forever, even though it was just a few months. Feels like you've been filming... for a long time. And then it feels like, everything's in a different place... than when it started. I wish Katya and I were still friends. I don't care about the TV show or anything as much as I care about... I just wish that, of all the people in the world to hate me... I hate that that person hates me. Everybody keeps being like, "Oh, yeah, you're fine without her." Yeah, that's not the point, you know what I mean? The point isn't whether or not I can continue to have a career without her. It's never been the point. I didn't like being on my own as much as I liked being friends with her. It was never about getting famous enough so that... you can survive on your own. I preferred surviving with her. That's the end of the film as Fena backs over the camera. - [Fena] I brought you tea. - Oh, thank you. [Fena] Water and your choice of... I did that thing from the other day where I did my eyes first. It's so much... So much easier to put makeup on - when there's no foundation down. - Do you want peanut butter - and jelly sandwich for your... - Ooh. [Fena] ...snack box, or...
