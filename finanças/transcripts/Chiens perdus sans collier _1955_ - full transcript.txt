INSPIRED BY THE GILBERT CESBRON NOVEL (EDITIONS ROBERT LAFFONT) Is anyone there? Is anyone here? - What do you want? - Where are your bosses? - They're at a wedding. - Are you all alone? Of course I'm all alone. - Can I take the big ladder? - No, it's forbidden! They'll scold me! They don't want to lend it. - But I'll bring it back. - No and no, I'm not lending anything! I'm in charge when they're not here. COURTHOUSE No. You go that way. You're going to kid court. It's written on the wall. JUVENILE COURT JUDGE Are you afraid I'll go to jail? Don't worry. It's no big deal. - I'll wait for you. - With them, it may take a while, you know. - You should go home. - Enough. - Go away. - You punk! - Dirty brute! - Are you gonna shut your mouth? I'm gonna make a complaint! - There he is. - It's about time. - My poor boy. - You didn't come here to whine! There goes my heart! He feels bad! It's all an act, guard. I don't fall for that. Hey, old guy. Is your heart okay? - Slap him in the face. - It wouldn't be the first time. Harder! Calm down. We can't hear a thing. So because you can't restrain yourself as you say, I'll restrain you. Yes, Your Honor. - You'll spend two months at Bon Pasteur. - Yes, Your Honor. While you rest for two months, I'll take care of your boyfriend. - Jo the pendulum is his name, right? - What has he done? Don't even try. I decide what's good and bad. - That's not fair. - But that's the way it is. - My two months isn't fair either. - Next case. It isn't fair, Your Honor. An adult would've gotten eight years. Yes, my dear prosecutor, but she isn't an adult. And I need two months to get a notice of expulsion for her pimp. Such is our pleasure. I'll take advantage for once when the law allows me to. Your Honor! She removed all the studs from the chair! The studs? Excuse me, sister. Well! How about that! One minute, miss. - You're crazy. Why did you do that? - To make you eat them! Enjoy. - Why? - So you'd die! I hate you! That proves that you're an idiot and you don't even know what you say. Take these studs and put them back. Put them back. Do you believe, Your Honor? I have all the time in the world. You're wasting yours. Are you finished? Nice upholstery work if you want to learn a trade. Have a nice trip, Miss Stud. Sit down here. So you're Fran?ois? No, it's Francis. And you don't know who you're dealing with! He'll let us know. Are you his grandmother? He has an answer for everything! Yes, I'm his grandmother. - Be quiet, Grandmother. - Talk to him about his bad side. - He's not deaf, is he? - Yes, in his right ear. - An accident? - No, he was born with it. Enough. Let's see, Francis. Do you ever go to the movies? - There's a question! - You'll have your turn to speak later. Tell me, do you like gangster movies? You can answer me since you hear me. - It's so I don't say stupid things. - You're right. You shouldn't say that. But you shouldn't do them either. Your raid in the changing rooms of the stadium yesterday afternoon? What I think, well, what you say? I know it's all a game. To play, you must be many. You go in the changing rooms and pick the pockets of the guys who are fencing outside to make yourself happy. You didn't ask if they agreed to play that game. I'm troubled. What will I do with you now? I know. No, you know nothing. You don't even know who I am. I know you're a judge! No. I'm a juvenile court judge. It's not at all the same. - You'll send him to prison! - Shut up. Do you decide? It's the first time! You're not allowed to lock me up! I'm not allowed? No. I should get probation. Morillon stole a motorcycle. It was the first time. He stayed with his parents. - I know. - So? The tribunal will decide. In the meantime, you can leave so the adults can talk. - He's right. I can send him home. - That's all we want. It depends a lot on you. You seem to be brave people. You love him. Unfortunately, you also love the bistros. I only drink beer at home! - What does Francis drink? - Him? Water and it makes me nervous with all the germs in the pipes! - And you? Has he already hit you? - Of course. He's mischievous. When you live like that in close quarters? - He's barely ever there! - What does he do? He does salvaging. - Ragman? - I call it salvaging. Yes. He salvages wallets too. - He never did an apprenticeship? - He was made to die young! A violent death! I read his cards. - I've never been wrong! - What does he say? He says, "In that case, I'll drive a Cadillac beforehand." He'll do it. He'll be a big gangster and he'll be buried with respect! Well, that's a nice future. Thank you. Sit down. Mrs. No?l, bring Francis in. - It's time for the hearing. - That's true. - I have to get dressed. - No need to bother us! On the contrary. You need to see to understand. Sit down. So? I had a chat with your grandparents. - We understood each other. - Can we go? Just a minute. The tribunal will decide. In the meantime, you'll spend a few days in a house where you'll relax and where nobody will read your cards. Mrs. No?l, write. "I acknowledge that I behaved badly with the members of the soccer team who I enjoy watching play. Especially when they win. And I accept to spend a few days in an observation center where I will play sports. Where I will play sports in the yard and not in the changing rooms." Now you just have to sign. Have him bring a suitcase with him. Clothing? And what else? You house them. You could clothe them too! Mrs. No?l, have Francis taken to the observation center. Excuse me. - Your Honor. - Excuse me, I have a hearing. We need to sleep. We've been in the street for three days. Okay, be quick. Okay, they told us everything. We're a workhouse boy. We left our farm on a whim for no reason at all and we don't want to go back. Not at all. I beg you, please speak properly. Why don't you want to go back to your farm? Country air is good. The air stinks. Maybe, but it's healthy. Weren't they nice to you? Did they beat you? I don't want to go back. - Where do you want to go? - I don't know. - You want to work, don't you? - I don't want to be a farmer. You want to learn a trade? What? Mechanic. So? Could they take him in Terneray? But I can't! He'd have to commit a crime. It's stupid but true. To learn a trade from the state, you have to commit a crime. - Did you do anything illegal? - Oh no, sir. How did you leave? From the farm? How? Yes. You traveled without a ticket, right? On the train or a bus? I jumped in a truck at the risk of breaking our neck. If you traveled without a ticket, you'd have committed a crime. It's not complicated. Listen. Wait for me and we'll talk again later. Excuse me, Your Honor, I'll be a little long today. My clients are in the room. - They need to get their money's worth. - So little. Excuse me. I'll be back. Hey, little man. - Have you eaten since you left? - Good vegetable soup at lunch. You didn't go three days without eating? - Speak. - I ate chocolate. Did you pay for the chocolate? With what money? Tell me what you stole. The chocolate or the money? - The chocolate. - There's the crime. That's a crime. The state can teach you a trade. Take him to bed and I'll go see him tomorrow. I apologize. Can we take care of a few adults now? - We must. - Don't adults interest you? It's not that, but I feel guilty with adults. - But with kids? - Less. So, my dear friend, I wonder what you're doing here. I sleep. In every tribunal there's a judge who sleeps and here it's me. Good night then. Good night, Your Honor. Lafalaise vs Huron, defendant on bail. Is Lafalaise present? Yes, Your Honor. On February 10, 1954, in payment of a bill? The chocolate. I'll hand you over to a very nice man. You will be polite to him and call him sir. There. Goodbye, Alain-Robert. Be good and do what the director tells you. We're extremely tired. Off you go. Attention! Continue, kids. Wait for me here. At ease! It's not bedtime yet. Empty your pockets. - What? You smoke? - No, sir. Get undressed. - Take off everything? - Yes. So will you tell me where you're from? - I don't know. - You don't know or don't want to say? - I don't want to go back there. - It's not that you forget. Less worrisome but more shady. We'll see later. In the meantime, take a shower. - A shower? What do you mean? - You've never taken a shower? Well, you'll see. What's this? - You were beaten? - Sometimes, sir. - Who did that to you? - Mr. P?nas. - Mr. P?nas sure knew how to hit! - Yes, sir. Wait a bit. Let me see your head. - Can I look? Do you have lice? - No, sir. Oh my. Your hair is burned. Look at me. Your eyelashes are burned too. Were you playing with matches? Answer me. I want to know how your hair got burned. You know, I always know everything. So? You have nothing to say? You'll speak soon enough. Go on. In the shower. No, I don't want to! - Are you afraid? - I don't want to go! - Tell me why your hair is burned. - I don't remember. So in the shower! No! - I don't want to go! - So do you remember? No? Yes, I remember! Okay, now draw me a garden. Your Honor. I was classifying Alain-Robert. - Alain-Robert? Hello, Pierrot. - The little workhouse boy from yesterday. The chocolate boy. He did some drawings. Yes, the drawings. First the drawings. Do some drawings and I'll analyze you. - You're not going to say... - I believe in the drawings. I love the drawings. I believe less in those who interpret them. First, things that are very clear. A worried nature deprived of maternal affection. I asked him to draw a woman. Here. No mistake. That's a woman. It's shocking, Your Honor. The woman is wearing a bra. He misses the maternal breast. He was weaned too young. Wait, there's more. Go play in the yard. You can finish later. This is a tree. - It's a cherry tree. Those are cherries. - No, Your Honor. - What, apples? - No, Your Honor. Still the mother's breasts. You think? That's not good. There's something even more curious. What else is there in these drawings? - What there isn't, Your Honor. - Meaning? No sign of obsession with fire. Why? What are you looking for? Don't you know? Didn't the director inform you? He set his farm on fire. That's why he left! He told the director everything! Fire? Me and my chocolate? - Where is he? - Sleeping. He hasn't slept much. - Do you want to see him? - Yes. First room. Hey. Hey! What you did doesn't stop you from sleeping, huh? - Hello, sir. - That's it. Now you're polite. You should've started yesterday. Polite people don't hide things. - I don't hide things, sir. - Oh no? You set a farm on fire and didn't do anything wrong! What did they do to make you set a fire? Beat you? When you didn't work? When I lost the sheep, he beat me with a belt. - You should've complained. - To whom? - The police. - They bought their butter from us. You could have asked to be moved. It was the same before. They beat me too. You know, parents beat their kids. It's not good, but it happens. I've been slapped. I still became a judge. Yes, but they were your parents. Yes. Like that, maybe my parents will find me. - What do you mean "like that"? - Seeing my name in the newspaper. For the fire! They won't see your name. We don't publish the name of minors. Do you think they'd be proud of you if they read that? I don't care. They'll find me. - You think they're looking for you? - Of course. My parents. - Who are your parents? - That's it. I don't know them. Go to sleep. I'll take care of you with the orphanage. Not to put you there. Don't worry. Go to sleep. Goodbye, son. There you are. What's going on? I have nothing. The old lady didn't bring me my clothes. - You can wait a bit. - If I don't go, they'll never get here. So you want to go out for a bit. Since I'm not in prison. - If you want. - Really? - I have business that way. We'll both go. - I know the way. You can show me. I was afraid I'd get lost. - I'll come back. - I sure hope so. I'll just be a minute. Wait for me. I'll go say hi to them. Come on. No reason to break a window. The old lady will be in a nightgown. So? Disgusting! - Where's your grandfather? - So he can be the third wheel? Pack your bag. How many shirts do I take? - Take two or three. - I only have one. - Well, take it. - I'll use it as a bag. Was this scavenged? You came here to play the cop? I came for many reasons. Hurry up. You don't want your sweater? What for? Are you keeping me until winter? - You're warmed up now, huh? - That isn't what I asked you. - You don't have to ask for anything. - I won't take it. - Is that your scarf? - It is now. You can wash it when we get there. Let's go. Are you happy now? You saw everything. Yes, I saw. - I had to understand. - Understand what? There's nothing to understand. It's home and I like it. Of course you don't like it. - I'll allow it. - I prefer to sit down. I'll allow that too. Don't turn around. I waited for you last night. You see that they kept you. - Who's with you? - Get out at the next stop. - The one after that. - If you want, but it's stupid. I told you not to go to the stadium. - The stadium. - Stop it. What's done is done. - How long will you get? - Nothing at all. Time served. - They'll do nothing. - So you think. I know. That man is paying for me. One. Don't look. - Is he a cop? - Yes, he's the judge. - He doesn't look bad. - They're the worst ones. - Are you nauseous? - No, it's the bus. - It didn't bother you before. - Of course not. Be careful! Brute. It's nothing. - The first months are the worst. - I don't know. I'm not asking. I'm telling. - You have to get used to it. - Yeah. You too. Don't look at him, I said. - Francis? - Yeah? - What if we told him? - Who? - The judge. - Are you crazy? What for? - For leniency. - Shut up. It'll be worse. No. He'll think "family man." He'll think "single mother" and you'll suffer the consequences. Why? It's not against the law. Trust them and they'll find something. Got it? They don't know you and it's nobody's business. - Got it? - As you wish. Go on, get out. Don't walk home. Do you have money? Don't worry. I'll be there on Sunday. Who's speaking now? It's your lawyer. I have a lawyer? Yes. The Black man who was there. You didn't see him? That's my lawyer? - Is he good? - I don't know him. Do they listen to Black men? I ask the tribunal to avoid unjustified prison time due to the benign nature of the crime. We must not forget that Francis has a hearing loss that is at risk of getting worse. You know better than me that it's only in a family environment that a deficient child can develop normally. I'll allow you to ponder the suffering he will face locked up with such an infirmity. I therefore request probation in this case. Was it even necessary to ask? Bring in Francis Lanoux. It's not nice to talk about people who aren't present. "After having deliberating, the tribunal rules that the charges are substantiated and sentences the minor Francis Lanoux to the Terneray Center until he has attained the age of majority. Fees will be paid by the Treasury as the parents have justified their limited means." Twenty-one? "Orders provisional enforcement of judgment notwithstanding appeal." Until the age of majority is standard. The time you'll stay there depends on you. - You told me probation! - I didn't tell you anything. I can't leave you with your grandparents. - Because we're poor! - Poverty wasn't all I saw. You should knock before entering! - It isn't my fault. - No. But it might not be theirs either. I don't care whose fault it is. - Take him. Next case. - But it isn't fair! You don't know what you're doing! I said "next case." This won't bear well for you! Yet another one who'll hate you. I'm paid for that. Very poorly, I might add. Next case. - Aren't you afraid I'll take off? - Go ahead! - You're always late. - I brought a bunch of stuff. You'll bring this one too. In you get! Well. The soccer champion smokes. See you next time, sir. - What's going on? - Nothing, sir. "Nothing"? You pushed the sprayer out! - The sprayer? - Go pick it up and fast. Where are your manners? You stay with him in the back. - You'll watch each other. - I'm not a babysitter! Every job is a good one. Hurry up, you two. Make it snappy. You staying with me? It's not my fault. I was sheltered in front. If it rains, I'll punch you in the face! Are you crazy? What got into you? I thought it was a shower thing. I don't want a shower! You're annoying. Go on the other side. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Only this ear is good. - Are you deaf? - No! I'm hard of hearing on the right side. I won't tell them. - Why did you tell me? - So you won't tell them. If you tell, I'll beat the crap out of you! Are you scared about me beating the crap out of you? It's raining. Put that down. Who do you think I am! - Did you steal baby bottles? - No. - Lollipops? - No, I set a farm on fire. Liar. Don't try to show off. - I swear! - It's gonna rain cats and dogs! - What'll you do? - Don't move. And tell me your story. You don't look like a firebug. Hey. Do you want to come up front? They could answer me. Want some shelter? No, we're fine like this. We're fine. We're having fun and talking. As you wish. TERNERAY CENTER Hey guys! Look who's here! Guys, we're here. Get out from under there. We'd love to! - Clever. You're prisoners now. - Want my can opener, boss? You'll stay like that forever. Pass the ball. We'll shoot fish in a barrel. They're fresh for canned goods. Shit! Go to hell, all of you! That's enough. We're not here to fight. Get out of the truck. Move back, everyone. I'm nauseous! I got sulfate in my mouth! Do that over there. A pretty heart-shaped butt! - Heart-shaped butt with us! - Heart-shaped butt with us! Leave him alone! Whoever bothers him will have to answer to me! You're not the boss here! Judo isn't for dogs. It's over, right? You, to the office. You too. Come on, follow me. - Heart-shaped butt. - Don't call me that! - Okay, but you should stay with me. - Of course. I mean close because of my ear. - You repeat if I don't understand. - Promise! - Don't yell. That's my good one. - Promise. Are you coming? - He asked if we're coming. - We have to go pee, sir. Over there. Hurry. - I don't have to. - Me neither. I wanna tell you something else. I thought about it. Your fire? The farm? I'll say it was me. - You what? - I set the fire. - Why? - Because they'll never believe you. You don't look the part. With a fire, I can defend myself. If you want. And if it were true, you wouldn't be here. Where would he be? An intentional fire would get him prison time. That's not true. The proof is I'm here. That's not proof, idiot. Why would you do that? - Because they were beating him! - You're crazy! You think they dared to beat me? I hit him when he tried to stop me. - Good! Tell them how you did it. - There's nothing to tell. Woman trouble. They won't understand. Wanna see something that knows women? Shut up. You're disgusting. This was really a matter of the heart. Love! I don't make love with my heart. Your story is childish. That's not what her father thought! He didn't want me to see his daughter. Know why? I was too poor. True. They're all the same, those bastards and their money. So I told him I'd set his dump on fire. After that, she'll be poorer than me and I won't want her. - So you go to hell! - And after that. Tell them! I broke into the car's tank for gas. - What kind of car? - A Cadillac. Then I put gas everywhere in the garage and set it on fire. Everything went! The house, the outbuildings? Believe me! What a fire! That must have been great! - Was it visible from far away? - Twenty kilometers! Do you realize? The girl and I were on a hill. We saw everything. Did you get the girl pregnant? - Why do you say that? - It happens. I'm asking! It happens. If you know better than me, you tell the story. Is that it? Lights out. I don't want to hear a peep. - Good night, boys. - Good night, boss. Hello. Get me the Tuileries Center, miss. Decide because they'll call back. I don't want my head shaved! I told you it depends on you. You're lucky because it's usually automatic if you escape. Zero. Not when you escape. When you're caught. It's all the same. Anyway, I don't believe you. You don't care about your hair otherwise you'd tell me where your friend G?rard is. I don't want to squeal. I'm not asking you to squeal. I'm asking you to be honest. In the interest of your hair. So? Where did he go when you parted ways? Here we go! Hello, Tuileries Center? Hello, Mr. Rousseau. Tell me? I have Berthier here. We found him on a street corner. No, G?rard isn't with him but? - Berthier wants to tell us. - Not on your life! Do you shave your fugitives down to the skin? I thought we could maybe make an exception? Is two centimeters okay? He prefers three centimeters. Yes, it's a lot. Of course. You're okay with three centimeters? In any case, we'll get him back. - Yes, but it won't be my fault. - I promise he'll know nothing. Yes, he's thinking about it. Four centimeters. Four centimeters. That's blackmail. He said four centimeters. No, wait. It's not decided. So? He's at his mother's. Okay, Mr. Rousseau. G?rard is at his mother's and Berthier wants four centimeters. At first glance, there's no real connection. Your barber will hold back a bit. There you go. Goodbye, Mr. Rousseau. What's wrong? Why the long face? - He's gonna punch me in the nose. - Who, G?rard? Not even close. Don't worry. Go on. You do have nice hair. He's going back to Tuileries. What are you doing on Sunday? - I mean, after mass? - Nothing. You'll take me and we'll go get G?rard. Maybe the police can bring him back? I don't really like the police in cases like this. I wanna see his mom, the mattress maker. - That's a pretext! - I want to see where she's at. - So will you take me? - See you on Sunday, Your Honor. Tell me, Mrs. No?l? - This newspaper is for Alain-Robert. - Again? If you send it every week, you could get a subscription. I don't want an address printed on it. He needs something handwritten with a stamp. He'll be even happier with two stamps. Shit, my judge! Hey, Your Honor! This is a surprise! Don't act surprised. You know we'd come one day. I won't say no. - Know what they're playing? - No. Me. They're playing. - You? - They're playing for who'll have me. You've never seen that, huh? Was it worth the trip? - It doesn't seem to upset you. - I have no say. I belong to the winner. It's the law of the jungle. - Shut up! - Don't say things like that to a judge! - Trump! - He's an open-minded judge. First, he's the juvenile court judge. We're kids up until what age? Don't worry. Forty-five-year-old kids don't interest me. - Speaking of kids, where is he? - Is he causing problems? It's not my fault. I didn't tell him to come back. - He has nothing but bad examples here. - Where is he? G?rard Lecarnoy, you aren't in the closet or the armoire. So you're under the bed and I don't want to bend down. The bad thing is you look ridiculous coming out and I understand that. So I'll turn my back and I won't look at you. Come out, stand up, and tell me when you're ready. - Are you out? - Yes, sir. - Your Honor. - Your Honor. Brush yourself off. - Are you clean? - Yes, Your Honor. Almost. You look good. They fed you well. - We haven't stopped eating. - They were happy to see you. Yes, me too. It was like a temporary absence. Let's say it's finished. So I'll take you back. Give me your hand. You won't ever let me go. He wins like he's cheating! He isn't saying you cheat! Shut up, you won! I don't know your mother's friend, but he isn't very desirable. Did he teach you how to fish with a grenade? Yes, Your Honor. What does he do? Poach? That's it? He's a famous pirate. Your pirate is dreadful. He's dirty for a man who's always on the water. - And he's quick to hit. - I run away. - Does your mother run away? - No, she doesn't say anything. I can't leave you with that guy. What if he loses? What would that change? Do you like the other one any better? - I believe you. - He's never been in prison? Never. He doesn't know what it is. - What does he do? - He walks on a steel cable. On a steel cable? Why? It's his job. He's an acrobat. He's an acrobat. He does fairs with a motorcycle and a trailer. - He's someone. - Yes, he's someone. - Does he drink? - Just water. He's an acrobat. Acrobat or not, Jean, Pierre, or Paul, I won't leave you where they play cards for your mom. Let's go. I'll come back. Listen, little man? During the war, I was a prisoner and I escaped. - You see! - They caught me. They said, "You're a prisoner. It's your job to escape and our job to catch you." And they put me back in prison. And after that? - After that, I escaped again. - You see! I see very well. And they caught me again. - So I'll catch you again. - Not for sure! Not for sure. Let's go. So you're taking him just like that? - In a way, it's better for him. - Yes, ma'am, it's better. Go back to your game, Queen of Hearts. Hey! You make me laugh. That's not a worm, it's a maggot! - Vermicelli! - Don't laugh. It's serious! - Hey! There's one! - That's a huge one! - I didn't say a big one. - We said nothing. We said, "One earthworm." - So that will be ten! - Ten cigarettes. You're crazy! He's right. That one's worth more. - We said five. - It's big. We say eight! - Eight is fine. - We said five! Decide. It's gonna go back in! - Hurry up. It's disgusting! - So what do you say? - So eight. - Eight. Show them! Eight. - Don't clean it! - You'll suffocate the poor thing! - The dirt too. - It doesn't count if it dies. Wait. You're not the one who's eating it. - Don't spit it out. - Don't throw up! Spit it out and you lose! I won't vomit. - Not bad. - Good job! - You're good for the circus. - It was a big one! My cigarettes! Bastard! You're not allowed to smoke! You're too little! You smoked a worm! Francis! - What are you yelling about? - They're bastards! - I ate a worm for eight cigarettes. - That was cheap! It was for you. They won't give them to me. He ate an earthworm? - To give them to me, you said? - Yes, but? Give them to me. They're mine, right! This is what I'll do with them! You're stupid to do stupid things for cigarettes! Shut up all of you! I'll make you all eat earthworms until you bleed. - You're disgusting. - It was for you. You're disgusting. That might be useful. Thanks anyway. Mail! Lauch?. Dubreuil. Messager. - Alain-Robert. - Mr. Heart-shaped butt's newspaper! The illustrated heart-shaped butt! Alain-Robert. Another one. - Heart-shaped butt, Sunday edition! - Heart-shaped butt. - You like it when I lend them. - I forbid you from lending them. You've been fooled, huh? - Newspapers again? - Can't your parents write? What are their names? Alain or Robert? - It's not clear! - Mr. and Mrs. Heart-shaped butt. - At least they don't open my mail. - The newspaper isn't mail! - They don't know how to write! - Is this printed? Are you finished over there? Goiraud. Doganat. Merlerin. Open again? Keep it. That's it. Scatter. - You got nothing? - My God! But I wrote to her! I don't need paper. I know she wrote to me! It's impossible! Or else she's sick! - Soup! - Go on, it makes you grow! - Aren't you hungry? - Yes, I'm hungry. In addition, the bastards feed you. JULIEN LAMY TRIBUNAL JUDGE - What is it? - I must speak to you. "Must." This is no hour to talk, dear! - I work during the day. - And I relax during the evening! Come in. - So what did you do? - Me? I didn't do anything! Isn't that why you're bothering me? I write to Francis and they don't give him my letters. So I came to complain. Francis Lanoux. You know that guy? I thought I'd seen you somewhere. Go on, sit down. I'll be right back. It isn't forbidden to write. What's forbidden is writing nonsense. I don't write anything bad! Nothing bad, of course! Rewritten love letters! No, I write them on my own. They don't need stories in Terneray! - They're already upset! - I tell him I'll wait for him. That's it. Why don't you tell him to escape while you're at it! You'd be happy if he did something bad to return to you. - He's allowed to think of me. - Yes and for you to think of him! Bravo, kids! Think! It's true love. Okay. You don't want to get married right away though? Get married? It's already done. What do you mean? In a way, yes. What does that mean? Nothing. He doesn't get your letters. Is that all you have to tell me? Good evening. Twenty letters is a lot! It is. I'll take care of it. - I'm sorry I bothered you. - No, you're the one bothered. You came for hardly anything in a way, as you said. - What's your name? - Sylvette. Good evening, Sylvette. Look at me. - You did something foolish, right? - It isn't foolish! Oh no. It's actually very intelligent. Take that off and let's talk seriously. - A baby, huh? - Of course. You didn't waste any time. Francis is like that. He wants everything right away. I see. A Cadillac, wallets, and a baby! - You're far along. - I don't need anyone's pity. There's nothing else to do. Sit down. You couldn't have said something sooner? He forbade me. Don't tell him I came. I'll tell him what I want. I'll do what I want. What are you going to do? Do you have parents? So you're deaf too? Yes, but I left. They kicked you out, didn't they? - No, I left. - Why? They told you off a bit? - A lot? - No, that's not it. What is it? Because they wanted me to get rid of it. And you don't. I want to keep it. I'm right. No? Of course you're right. We need children. We need a lot of them. Well, not too many of course. My father beat me. And they scared me. So I ended up saying yes. They took me. - I don't know where it was. - I didn't ask. And? At the lady's house, while I waited alone? They left me there. I was lying down. There was a crocodile hanging. - A crocodile? - It was swinging. I didn't have the courage. I ran away barefoot in the street. - Barefoot. - And my shoes were still new. - What do you do now? - I have a place. I work. Yes, but after? Exactly. Francis has to come back! You've got it all planned out. Did you tell him about the crocodile? You think? I don't know what he'd have done. He's bad, you know. I know! You put him there. You can get him out. We'll see. In the meantime, sit there. You're going to write to him. I don't want you to quarrel. I'll go to Terneray and give him the letter. Here. What do I tell him? I thought you wrote on your own? If I tell him you'll help us, is that made up? Tell him you'll have an exam. I don't have to believe you. I'm not worried about that. Do you see Francis as a family man? I have to. Is he happy? He loves the baby. Naturally. Another one who loves kids, huh? Tell him I want to change jobs and we had a drink together. - What are you doing? - I'm kissing him! That's clean. Go on. Have a quick drink. - This is it. - I can't! - Your pillow. - What for? Do what I tell you. Hurry up! It's nothing. It's Magnat going crazy. Shit! They should have added horsehair. We can never eat that! Don't worry. I'll take mostly milk. - To sell? - To give! Go back and keep an eye out. Francis! Drop it! - Do you think he's dead? - Shut up! I don't know! - You hit him too hard. - If you're afraid, stay! - I'm not afraid! - You can stay anyway. - I don't care. I'm going with you! - You're a leech! Your pillow! - It isn't full. - Too bad! Too bad, I said! - It's heavy! - It is. I want it to be solid. What a piece of shit! Pick up what you can. Bastards! Quick! Hey! Are you sleeping already or just napping? I'm not tired. He's not tired because you're tired before you sleep. What time is it? Almost six o'clock. Do you remember what I told you as we left? No. I said you didn't have to follow me. - Yes, but we made a pact. - We made a pact before. Before what? Before I knocked him out. That changes everything. - Why? - Go to sleep, then we'll talk. Like that. On your elbow. I'm not sleeping. I'm resting. You can talk. I can talk. Fine. So I'll tell you. I'm not alone. I have a wife. I took off to be with her. I'm finished with you. If we stay together, we'll be found immediately. I don't take you for a traitor. I warned you. That's what you do when you do something bad. You separate. Did you hear? Maybe it's better like this. G?g?ne. Be nice. Buy him a bowl of milk when he wakes up. You're leaving him? What will I tell him? Tell him I'm a bad influence. - You did foolish things again. - He knows about that. He's a kid with no fear. I prefer to be alone to do what I have to do. I'll leave you some canned goods for the bill. Francis! - What is it? - You can't leave me alone. What a pain! - You're throwing everything away! - I want to go with you! I told you that you can't. If you'd only listen! - You don't sleep when you must. - What am I going to do? You've pissed us off about your parents forever! - What are you waiting for to find them? - My parents? Yes. You're not giving up? I wanted to find them for both of us. That's an idea. Let me know what happens. Leave a message here with Eug?ne. - For real? - As real as it is that you'll find them! You see. No need to even say goodbye. You'll remember? Here at Eug?ne's? Francis! Francis! Bastard! You're nothing but a bastard! I'll find them! They'll be all mine! - What do you want, child? - Information about the mail. - What information? - Did this get mailed to me from here? Yes, it seems so. It's from here. Why? They send them to me every week. - It's possible. Who? - My parents. So? So do they bring them to you? No. They have to put them in the printed materials box. - Do you know the people... - Who sent them to you? No, I don't. What are your parents' names? Same as me. Robert! Robert? No, I don't know Robert. - What does your father do? - I don't know. - We're in a hurry. - Go look in the phone book. Mrs. Roudier? Can you help the boy find a name? - Maybe you'll find something. - Thank you. I want to pay my taxes, but don't give me time to think about it. Sit down over there. What are you looking for? - Can I help you? - I'm looking for my parents. - Where are they? - I don't know. I'm looking. Are you all alone? Who is your dad? I'm a kid looking for his dad, his dad - Do you know that one? - No. That's true. You're too young. Here's another one. My parents came to get me - What are your parents' name? - Robert. Robert? Wait. I knew a Mr. Robert. Wait? I think he had a son! - He doesn't live very close by. - Is it far? Far? Want to come with me? We can give it a try. Your Honor. Sit down. I won't shake your hand. You don't deserve it. - Shall I leave you? - Yes, this is my police station. - So? - Nothing. - He just bought him some ice cream. - Is he known? In vice, we call him the tie. He's almost a celebrity. Well. - Where is Francis? - I don't know. - Not at all? - No. The inseparables. Francis abandoned you. - Like an old sock. - No! A very old sock. That's a good friend. A real big brother. Loyal, devoted to his little Alain-Robert. Who runs away after he knocks out Marcel. - He's not dead? - You'd prefer that, wouldn't you? How did you meet the man we found you with? He said we were going to see my parents. - Your parents? - Yes, I'm looking for them. - How? - With this. It must be them who sent these to me. Mrs. No?l? Who put that idea in your head? Only my parents know I was born. To send me newspapers, it must be someone who likes me. Listen, Alain-Robert. When you're a big boy like you, the truth can't scare you or hurt you either. So? For the newspapers, you're right. It's someone who likes you. It isn't your parents. This story about parents is finished. Get that into your head. You don't have any parents. They were surely brave people. But you'll never know. We don't know who they are. You must believe they were like you. They had no luck. So I don't have parents? - No. It happens. - So whose writing is this? It's mine. Look. What about my mother's? - I want to go with Francis. - You don't even know where he is. - Do you know? - I could find out. - Your Honor? - You're just in time. - Robert, who you know. - Yes. - Who stole some chocolate. - Yes, I remember. And? Please bring him to the observation center. - With pleasure. - With pleasure. Give me Francis's file. And then we'll see where we can put him. I want to go with Francis! You'll never be with Francis. You're not good together. I hope you never find him! I hope we will, little man, as soon as possible. Because if I let him go, he'll do even worse. Next time, it'll be a real judge. - Do you have something for me? - Yes. Here you go. Call the investigating judge. Yes? - Little G?rard. - G?rard? The mattress maker's G?rard! - Did he run away again? - To his mother's. To his mother's. Parents! That's all they think of! Alain-Robert, come here. Do you prefer the sea or the mountains? Why? There are centers at both. I'll send you where you want. I don't care if Francis isn't there. I'll send you to the mountains. You'll get some color. Take one while you're waiting. The investigating judge, Your Honor. Hey! This summer I'll come by and say hi. I'll keep my eye on you. You're not alone anymore. Hello, Mr. Doublet. Excuse me. It's about Francis Lanoux. Yes, I have an idea. A way to find him is with a little girl. Yes, a little girl. You writing this down? Sylvette Villain. Sylvette Villain. She works at the train station hotel, she's a waitress or a maid. From what I know of him, that'll lead you right to him. Oh yes. I have good reasons! I won't tell you what, but I have them. You're welcome. Act fast. Goodbye, Mr. Doublet. Yes, Mrs. No?l. That makes two to try to catch. What did I say? There are three of them. It'll never end. What a job. - What happened? - Didn't you understand? - Not everything. - I'll explain quickly. - Careful. - Where are we going? Don't worry. It's all arranged. It's the one at the end. Careful. It's slippery. A barge goes nice and slow. You won't be seasick. - If they're looking for you? - They're looking for me. They think I'm running fast like I always do. The barge goes very slowly. They think I'm far away and run ahead while we follow behind them. Nobody notices. I trick them. That's the one that's leaving. - That's great! - I am! Shall we kiss? Don't turn around. The cops are there. You were followed. - No! - Did you talk to anyone? Nobody, I swear! They're over there. Don't look. What if you talk to them? If you explain? There's nothing to explain. - I killed a guy. - Why didn't you tell me? There was no time. You didn't do anything. I'm taking off. - So? - Run, Francis! Help! She jumped in the water! Don't go. It's a trick! Stop, bastard! Your girl jumped in the water! Bastards! Don't grab me. Let me take you. - He's crazy. He wants to cross. - This way, you idiot! They haven't caught us yet! I'll pick them up on the other side. Sylvette! Faster! Sylvette! Faster! Me again. Where is the phenomenon? Where he is, it would surprise me if you could get him. - Really? Why? - You can't have vertigo. Parents give me vertigo. - That's not G?rard? - It is. Don't you see? - Who's the other one? - The acrobat who was playing before. Oh yes. It looks like he's the one who won. Yes. He's crazy! He loves it. As long as he's content, he's happy! If I leave him with you? Leave him? With a woman like me? You mean that? If you were a bad mother he wouldn't keep coming back. You didn't say that before. I don't know what I said. I'm just asking. He's going to kill me. - What they need is tenderness. - We love him for that. It isn't that. What's important is they love you. A little boy keeps you busy. So do you want him? It's always the same. You ask questions and answer them. - So it's yes? - And I've had it with men. You see. Now you can think about mattresses. There they are, the devil and his son! The devil and the imp, the devil and his convoy. Now, ladies and gentlemen, for the sole purpose that the devil doesn't pull the devil by the tail, we'll pass among you. Find it in your hearts, please! Devils have no retirement fund! That gives him a trade. - You're not difficult. - No, I'm not. For the devil! G?rard. - Thanks, Your Honor. - Not Your Honor. Just mister. Thanks just mister. For the devil! For the devil! THE END Subtitle translation by: Leanne Bordelais
