We should create a global and innovative economy, promote education and the health system and fight against corruption and burocracy. EAST BERLIN, NOV,1989 Once upon a time a little old man who laughed just like that... BLACK FLOWERS What? I'm telling you... It doesn't matter... Let's have a cigarette, some tea and keep going. Eugeni, Vodka? Cheers! What is it? Are you having fun? You promised me a bear. You are the bear. CAUCASUS, NOV, 1989 -May I come in? -Yes, come in. Yes. I'll call you later. -It's hot! -Sorry, General. MOSCOW, NOV, 1989 -Hi. -How are you? How are you? Your passport. Let's go. I've got to get something. We have an agreement, you understand. If I can't take it with me, I'm staying here. That's not what we agreed. I know. Bloody Russians. Shit! She was on the floor when I got here. Have a look in the bathroom. EAST BERLIN, NOV, 1989 And we found the girl, that's all. In other words, Milo's got away from us once again. You knew how important this operation was. The woman was going to give us the names that belong to Sycamore. The traitors on our side; and the Soviet traitors as well. I don't understand how they killed her right under your noses -and how the list could disappear. -It's obvious, isn't it? Milo is one of ours. Why did you go to the hotel alone? It could have been the Russians. Anyway, the operation failed. And Milo is still among us. A double agent. Fleischmann, Roddick, I can't keep you on. The best you can do is disappear. That's all. But I wasn't in the hotel when all this happened. It was a mistake, Fleischmann, that's all. -And now what? -That's your problem. You said once the only safe place was right in the middle of it. And now? Now, now it's not anymore. Take care of those hips. Hi. I want to go home. Do you miss your mum? What did you see? Uncle Vitia'll get us across. Ok? Who is it? -Shall we play hide and seek? -Ok. Who was it? 18 YEARS LATER Bye, good night. -Shall we go? -Yes. Come on boys, One over here... Make some space, please. -And the lettuce over there. -For me. That's all isn't it? -Well, enjoy! -Thank you! Boys, have a good weekend! Dad, I'm off. Where are you going? To see your gourmet! The most exotic thing he's ever ordered must be a sandwich. You know very well that we're over. We have switched to kebabs. Ciao! Ok, very good. Let's push on... Perfect. Come on, with the hand, very good. The opposite leg. Perfect. Very good Peter. A bit more... This hand... Come one... Push a bit... You'll get good sensations now. Very good, like this. Ok... Perfect. All right, now we're going to remove the harness, Peter. Come down a little more. Perfect. We'll take this side off first. All right. VIENNA -Room service. Your dinner is served. -Come in. The guessing game continues regarding the mysterious death of the Hague high-court Judge, Gerhard Kemp, who was in charge of the open case against war criminals in former Yugoslavia. Kemp's death is still sub judice, but all the rumours point towards the possibility of murder, instead of suicide as the police assumed at first. According to sources this newspaper has been able to access before dying, Kemp sent the legal authorities a report about the presumed illegal activities of a group formed by ex members of the KGB and western secret services. As you may remember, Kemp was on the front page of every newspaper a few months ago, accused of having passed on privileged in for... Yes, it's me. Good, good... Gerhard will not come for dinner. No, he won't come ever again. Ok. Very well. See you later. Elena? Excuse me, I wanted to talk to you privately. Do I know you? Have you ever heard of the sycamores? Yes, they're trees, aren't they? Excuse me... When the cold war ended, agents on both sides formed an international organisation called Sycamore. I think your father knows about it. Your mother knew it. My parents were murdered. I know. Ask Michael Roddick about your mother's death. "Oysters in jelly..." There is nothing like a good roast knuckle with mustard and potatoes... -I bet you don't even have mustard. -Clavel. What are you doing here? Chatting with an old friend. I do little jobs like this now, You could say I'm retired. You couldn't offer me some wine, could you? One of the 160 Euro ones. I've been watching you for some days, you look like a man who's thrived. It doesn't seem quite so when I look at you. First, you smell it, don't you? Exactly. Not like beer. What do you want? You know. The list. What? What are you talking about? How's your daughter? I don't have the list. And anyway, who could it possibly still interest? By all accounts, half the world. People collect things like that. You threw me out of the services because I couldn't find it. -So, what does this mean? -Listen, Michael. Just the thought of killing you makes me lazy. But killing a girl as beautiful as your daughter excites me. Really, it excites me. I'll say it again, I don't have it. You killed the Russian. You're the only one who could have done it. You were the only one there. So, either it turns up or you won't come out of here alive. Then I'll go after your daughter. It's Ok. Ok. You win. I've got it. But... Not here. This was always your biggest problem, you think you're smarter than you really are. We need to learn from the past. If we focus on it, we can make the right decisions about what is acceptable and what isn't. Clavel? Where is Elena? He... He wanted to... -Yes? -Clavel? Clavel isn't here at the moment. He's gone outside for a bit, but he'll be back soon. Shall I take a message? No. Only that I'm waiting for him at home. Ok. Who shall I say called? -Sandrine. -Sandrine, yes. Ok, I'll do that. Bye. Peter, I need you. And what are you going to do now? I've lost it all once before. I can't start over again. Give them what they want. If they sent Clavel, they'll send another. I don't have it! So, what the fuck will you do? I'd arranged to meet Elena. Make up something. I'll see you here later. Shut up, idiot! What the fuck's up with you now? Sandrine. You are Sandrine, aren't you? Exactly as Clavel described you. Exactly the same. Do you know who sent him to me? No? Who paid him? Neither? Who paid him? Who paid him? I don't know. He didn't say anything! I don't know! -I know who pays him. -What? I know who pays him! I know who pays him. I sometimes cash the cheques in... Where are the cheques? Where are the cheques? You should tell me, don't you think? 10,000 dollars... on Sarlat Consultancy's instructions. Are you going to kill me? I'll give you a tip. Get out of here. Where are you going? Elena, Elena, Elena! They've found Elena. Where is she? They've told her that you know more than what you've told her. Does the name Sarlat ring a bell? Large consultancy office in Graz. They sent Clavel. They paid him. After 20 years... Everything's starting over. I don't know what Kemp said, but someone thinks you have the list. This is absurd. Do you have it? No. We're talking about our things, Elena. Yes, but your things also happen to be my things. It's been 18 years since they killed them, and I still don't know who did it, or where their bodies are. I haven't had my mother for 18 years, I swear I miss her every single day. So I want to know what's going on. I want to know why a guy I don't know at all turns up on my door step, and tells me to ask you about my mother's death. I want to know right now if you're hiding something from me. No. What is Sycamore? Again? I've told you already... Sit down, Elena. Please. Elena, Sycamore... is a contacts network, people and information. Our job was to find it, but we failed, we didn't manage. Your mother had this list. And now, 20 years later, the organisation thinks I've got it. But we never had it. Elena, I know that... that I'm not a substitute for... But I brought you up, and you... you are all I have. What's waiting for us now... What's coming to us won't be fun. And I'm very afraid for you No, no... Where is it? Where is it? Elena, don't use credit cards, or your mobile. Don't call me. I'll call you. Peter will be with you. He knows what to do. I'll need a few days. Here is some money. Take it, you'll need it. What I said doesn't matter at all, does it? We'll talk when I get back. Good morning, how can I help? -I want to speak to Mr. Sarlat. -Do you have an appointment? Tell him Raimer Clavel is here. Hello. A visitor for Mr. Sarlat. Mr. Raimer Clavel. This way please. Mr. Clavel. Yes. Pleased to meet you. They've just found your body in Barcelona. You were the last one I expected to see. They say you were very smart. And you pass yourself off as Clavel? And you drive his car? Sandrine told us everything. Sandrine? I don't know who she is. Not willingly of course. Is this type of job usual for your company? We act as intermediaries in all sorts of jobs. But never carry them out ourselves. What am I going to do with you? They've asked you to find a list, haven't they? Correct. I've got it. Why don't I like the sound of this? You needn't sacrifice Clavel. I'm willing to hand it over, but... Don't move. But not to you. A mere intermediary. I want to give it to the person who contracted you. It's hot, isn't it? Very. Hot enough to start sweating. Shut up! Clavel sweated like a pig too. -I told you to shut up! -You better shut up. You have to know when to shut up. Do you live in Barcelona? Yes, it's me. I love Barcelona. The FC Barcelona. Fantastic! I've spoken to the interested party. And? They accept your offer. Think of it as business. Everything is business. Janosch will take you to your fate. Well... Tell me... where we are going. We can talk about football, about the weather, women, whatever you like, but not where we're going. It doesn't matter to you. The abyss between the rich and the poor has to be overcome. Get in there. Get dressed. Come on, put this on. Quickly! Come on, get a move on! -Where are we going? -Always asking. You should know when to shut up. So this is Michael Roddick... in his current appearance. -You. -Yes, me. You seem like a reasonable man, one can talk to. Come, Mr. Roddick. We should walk through the woods more often. Nature is wonderful. Look, here there's still snow, and over there... the flowers are growing already. It's in perfect order. A fantastic network. Everything within reach. A vision of nature. You are atheist, aren't you? I admire Atheists. Atheists are really those who are most preoccupied by God. In balance. Nature is balanced. Nature takes care of itself. Nothing. We've been like this for 2 days. Will you stop? No. Pack your cases. We're going. What does a state man like yourself have to do with Sycamore? Sycamore. In reality, it's an... organisation, a community of interests that... that has to make decisions. Governments come and go, but we stay on. Until death do us part. All of this has nothing to do with politics. Or maybe yes... Why does a politician like yourself want that list? I'll explain it to you. The people on that list were the core of Sycamore. Names of importance, of great importance. Flawless citizens. And they should keep on being so, but there are also traitors amongst them. Listen, I left 20 years ago. They fired me, I've got a restaurant. Dear Mr. Roddick, we all make mistakes. Gerhard Kemp was on that list. Was. But he got himself caught. He threatened to reveal everything. And someone was blackmailing him. -And you think that it was me. -Could be. Are you on the list? Am I on the list? You went with that Russian woman... to the hotel. You have the list. I only said it, to be able to talk to you. I don't have it, It doesn't exist, and if it exists... It'll be in the hands of those who blackmailed Kemp. Mr. Roddick, I think that... we'll finish this conversation another day. You know... Before, we used to laugh about the old comrades, Now we're the old ones. You want to run away, don't you? Go ahead, do it. Do it. What would you like? As mediator in the negotiations, the person chosen was the former head of the European Commission for help and development: Jacob Krinsten. Thanks to his skills, Mr. Krinsten has won the trust of many African states. Let's go live to the press conference. We will only achieve our objectives if we are not stingy and treat important matters with the attention they deserve, if we find a way of overcoming stale ideas and obsolete thinking, if we substitute a politic of fear with a politic of hope. This is the way. And if we really have the courage to choose change. 20 years ago or so, a great European politician created the concept of the word Perestroica. Now is the time to take on this path again. Any question? Good evening, can I help you? I'll deal with this, I was expecting him, thank you. What are you doing here? You were expecting me. You've... improved. A lot. Curtis was the right choice. A choice that didn't last long. Put me in touch with Curtis. I must speak to him. We don't speak. We keep the business going. But I can't stand to even see him. I'm sorry. I have to speak to him. Now. I need a mobile and something to eat. Marta, I'm in a tight spot. Please. You haven't changed. You are the same as 20 years ago, when I left you. Exactly the same. Hello, may I speak to Mr. Curtis? It's Marta. Yes, Mrs. Curtis will do. Thank you. Hello, darling, how are you? Could you do me a favour? Could you tell Curtis an old friend needs to speak to him? I will. Thank you very much. Bye. Good night. You'll have to make it yourself. Excuse me a moment. Curtis left the intelligence services after the German reunification and came in to be part of the private company. And successfully so. Very. And why did he leave your marriage? Out of vanity. Once he had reached success, he decided he wanted someone on the same level as his new social life. So he found himself one of these posh girls, very stylish and no brain. And left me. It rings a bell. But you knew how I was. And what I wanted. Yes... And you've achieved it. No... I haven't. Let me have a look at your wound. Are you staying in a hotel? You can stay and sleep here. Do you know this is the first time I've asked a man to stay? I might be getting old. Let me finish. Whatever you think, I like to take care of defenseless men. And you? Have there been others? You know what? I was very surprised when you decided to adopt that girl. Did you hold me in such high esteem? Curtis would get very upset if I fucked you. You've always had a way with poetry. I have no time for poetry anymore. I have no doubts we'll do it in the best possible way. But even then, it won 't be enough. Our best won 't be enough. There needs to be a personal change at all levels. Good morning. The only thing I could find. Has he phoned? No. I hope she's given him the message, anyway... I'll call him again later, Ok? Ok. You can stay here if you like. Hi, love. Do you need money? No, thank you. Yes? Michael, is that you? Dad? You have no idea how much I regret seeing you again. I thought Krinsten was your boss. In Sycamore there are only talents. There are no bosses. Have you had a good night? What did you say to Krinsten? Ask him. He's your partner. Him and I are like brothers... but I have my own plans. Marta still likes you. Interests in common. A union for life. Why are you here? Because of her, as you know. She called you despite fucking me. I've said it ever since I met you, you have to know when to shut up. That's enough Janosch, that's enough. Cigarette? Here. Why did you go to see Krinsten? You sent Clavel after me. I don't have the names or the list. You tell him that. Should I? You know that, and so do I. But does the fact make us friends? The deal was the money for the list. The deal was they wouldn't get the Russian or the list and I'd deal with the consequences. It's odd she would keep the list in her head only. It must have been her life insurance. Is that all? Do you want to say good-bye to Marta? -What do you want? -Power. Power. Do you think politicians decide on matters of war and peace? Sycamore is made of the people who really take decisions. The time has come for me to lead Sycamore. Gerhard Kemp. It was you. He wanted to do the same. He wanted to rise. A small fight for power, and he fell out the window. I understand. The organisation thrives and grows, everyone in their place. They need water, medicine... Krinsten provides each country with credit to pay for the business. And for his humanitarian services, he gets a couple of oil wells. Yes, the Sycamores organise personal space for a lot of people. And where do I fit in? You've turned up again. Krinsten and the others got edgy about Kemp and they want to know who went against him and why. Someone needs to pay for the consequences, and it's you. It's your turn again. I've been off 20 years. It's absurd. No one'll believe you. You are the one, believe me. Who was with the Russian? Who could have taken the list? You were a traitor once before. I'll make you an offer: You write a confession in which you admit you killed the Russian and blackmailed Kemp with the list. And now... you don't know what to do. A wonderful deal... And in exchange, Elena will be safe. Elena... you won't find her. Elena is my guest at my home in Viena. It's not true. You faked it. It's a fake. Do you really think so? Do you want to know who brought her to me? Remember that old saying in the state police? There is no one better placed as traitor than the best friend. Peter. No, you... Not you. Sometimes one has to choose. This time I chose me. I've sacrificed myself for 20 years. Today it's your turn, Michael. You despicable rat, I'm going to kill you, pile of shit! I'll kill you! Do what Curtis says and no harm will come to Elena. Not to her. So... You'll write a nice will. The matter has overcome you, etc. The most important is for everyone to believe you're guilty. I trust your literary skills fully. You know. Good bye. And what happens to Michael now? -Janosch will take care of it. -No. I want to do it. I understand perfectly. Our society only has one future: Democracy. Fuck, it's cold! We could leave him here to freeze to death. But people like to see a man's blood. Don't know why. That's why we shoot them. Do you want me to do it? No. Fuck... It's cold! I should have brought my cap. It's not normal. Are you shooting? But hurry up, hurry up or we'll freeze to death. Curtis? Elena? It's not difficult to recognise you. I knew your mother. In her days... I was leading an operation to take your mother to West Berlin. All that, the wall, the cold war, everything's become a theme park for morbid tourists. In fact... your mother was our last action in Berlin. And why did he take me with him? Guilt... expiation. We managed to bury the operation, as the Soviets weren't interested in airing it too much either. But since Gerhard Kemp's death, it's possible the case might be reopened. Do you know where Michael is? No. Go back to Barcelona. Go home. You can't come up. There's CCTV everywhere. Let me go! Peter brought you here, to the very man who killed your mother. -It was you. -No. Curtis told you that, didn't he? Didn't he? Where's Peter? Take care of her. So... according to you, Curtis killed my mother and also Peter. In any case, you are always innocent. I knew your mother's assassin. I was involved As everyone. Her too. Why did you adopt me? Your mother... told me something on that day. She gave me information about... At first I thought it would be a microfilm, or a disquette, but... the only thing in the room was you. There was nothing else. Only you. I don't... I don't remember anything. As much as I try to... to reconstruct what happened... God! I can't remember. You were the information. Without knowing it. That's why you took me, isn't it? For the information. Once upon a time a little old man who laughed just like that... Sing to me, Elena. Slowly. Slower. It was a clue. The list with all the people who were part of Sycamore. With Jacob Krinsten at the top. What are you doing? Saying good bye... to a friend. The redeemed assassin. Guilt and expiation. I didn't do it. Then... everything lost its meaning. Nothing had any meaning anymore. How nice. The redeemed assassin. I didn't kill her. But you were part of it. You hid it. You got paid for it. And to top it all off, you kept me... to use me and 20 years later Michael, 20, you are still killing people. I don't want to see you ever again. You disgust me. Elena. Elena. I love your body. This is for you. Janosch still hasn't come back. And... about the other one, do you know anything? Nothing. Good. What shall we do? Wait. -What would you like? -Where is she? She's not working today Close the door. Yes, you make a good couple. You serve him... you try hard so that your whole life revolves... around pleasing him. Call him. Curtis? -Michael is here. -I want you here within an hour. And if you are a minute late, even one minute late... I'll blow her head off. I know you don't care that much, but you would have to give a lot of explanations. Hello, can you hear me? Within 59 minutes. Marta? What do you want from me? My confession. Too late. This is not good. Not good at all. I have here 3 bullets, one for each of us. That way we'll be the 3 together again. Look, Michael, the confession you signed is very important to me. It's my life insurance. But I'll make you another offer. I want to show you something. Down there. Will you keep the same conditions for her? I'll make the same offer I made then. An altruistic suicide. And Krinsten will calm down. The girl doesn't interest me. -And who guaranties me this? -I do. What will you say to Krinsten? That you threw Kemp out the window? That old, out of date, conceited clown, who feels himself like the conscience of Europe. He doesn't even know how little time he has left. Now, without Kemp, it's his turn to retire and leave me his seat. And then he can dedicate himself to preside over the "man of the year"... Or he can go... to Africa and fight against ablation on the Black Continent. You have a very peculiar sense of humour. Sorry. It's just that... -It's just that... -What? You've reminded me... You reminded me of Janosch. "Sometimes you should know... when to keep you mouth shut." So you wanted to retire me? Thank you, Marta. Let's go. Come. I don't think we'll have the opportunity to meet again. Curtis showed me your confession. It's too perfect to be true. The only problem is that now you know too much. I don't know anything. I'm a chef. I understand. You're perfectly entitled to want to know nothing. I'm fine that way. Yes. That's what they all say. By the way... Thank you. The bullets trick was very good. Well done. It's over. Subtitles: Arigon From other countries' experiences we know that serious problems can only get resolved in a climate of genuine democracy. In a civilian society where the government feels responsible for the people and people aren't afraid, or doubt in taking initiatives. This seems the only way to me. Thank you. Subtitles: LASERFILM
