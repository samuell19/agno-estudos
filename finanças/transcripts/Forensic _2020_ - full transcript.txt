Still questioning, madam, let's see, Like Samuel Kattukaran Legal Consultant Hmm A recommendation from the Commissioner we will see, I am a Judicial Judge Someone asked Let's see Samuel has two things, one..

There is no need for it, madam Divya was abducted, not in a car According to the autopsy report, samples of the leopard's body were found The pieces of rust are some kind of iron balance And something like a white stamen And these are the scars of discarded water, like mud At the same time he had some rust marks on his salwar Those rust marks were on the right side of the salwar There's no mud on this side This path must have taken the divine All right Something like the white stamens we got from Divya's body It was said that there was something like clay in the clothes It could be from this The muddy scars in Divya's clothes, They must have been made of this Look at that, This is where the divine has been abducted Yes, Why don't you call? Do you know how many calls? for me? Hmm ... Hello Sam, what the hell are you doing? Mum I was in the lab, Go to Westmore Hospital today and get the letter from the psychiatrist. Then something else Another member joins the group He'll work with you, as usual Give him the phone All right, madam Hello, Yes Zika ... write down my number Definitely madam Ma'am, I'll write you down Yes, say it, madam My land number Write ... - All right You know the reason you were appointed Ok ma'am The medical consultant Sam's always on the alert That's the main reason you're on this team Sam's day-to-day operations I want to call the number I just gave you You have to do this very secretly, Mum, the phone's on the speaker What You really, ...

Sorry What's in Dr. Alfons' room? Thank you. Okay Wait The judicial section, right? Yes, Sit down ... Sit down ... Ritika said to me Say, For Keerthi's report, It needs a doctor's letter The police need all the evidence There must have been reports of the child's condition See, Rithika's interrogation Keerthi's time was about two hours Except he loses His mental condition is perfectly fine All right Then the letter from the doctor who wrote about Keerthi's condition Absolutely I'll give you this case information. I'll get it Hello Divya's case is asking for information Don't send WhatsApp, I'll write Tell me Okay. Wait a second Don't say that All right The marker has althylene Acids in coffee ... If you wash it with acid, you can erase the aldehydes Taught in school, Right? Here, Thank you Isn't that what the name said? SAMUEL JOHN COURT The scoundrel is our Ibrahim sir, Grandson ... Xavier John's little May I come, then? All right All right Okay. Thank you come here Be nice Just smile Daughter. Give me one, too. In my opinion, Because the media is paying so much attention to this case The killer keeps on abducting That is, Somehow we have to stop the next incident This is the main reason why Divya's murder received so much media attention The company owns garbage on the site ... Because the body was brought to an open place So it is difficult to control the spread or spread of it And with our resources, This is what's missing from Amusement Park Now that's our lead I'm looking into it, sir All right You come with me They were specifically asked to come at 8.00 It's not, This here, Did Madam see this? It's a better place to put your body Up that garbage dump, So why didn't the killer do it, Where the body was found, The height of that concrete wall with dirt At least six feet, right? So, You're right 6 feet above this wall, The killer does not have the physical strength to turn his body Just think, It was the children of Divya's dancing, Security at the Water Think Park, There is no evidence in any of these cases When the kidnapping happens, Even so, the killer was abducted How? These mud markings in Divya's asthma Take ran side by side can be progressed gǣvunā That's why it's so bad And In the little lane from the dance class The wall is 4 feet up, That is, A man who cannot move his body beyond the six-foot-tall wall Only children continue to be abducted This murderer we're looking for, Behind these crimes There's a kid Look, Sam, I told you this before, Government salary, If there is such a qualified police force to investigate Don't try to solve the Indian case by watching Hollywood movies There was a boy named Madam Amarajith Sara But there is no age limit for the perpetrators, ma'am This is him Amarajith Sara He is the youngest person in the world arrested for a serial murder He was 8 years old This guy who studied with him had three people close by The head was cut off and killed It's not Europe or America, madam This is our India In Bihar He's not the only one Mary Bell, Robert Thomas twins 10, 12 .. have been child murderers at the ages Prisons are everywhere in the world Children are definitely capable of committing serious crimes That's why Madam has a separate rule for us All right, Sam That's enough, Read nonsense, A jungle theory that can't even be imagined Do you and your family pull down the theories? Have you known him before? Hmm, Brother's wife ... On the way back out of the academy My brother, Ritika Madam's got married Just like Rhithika didn't have a problem with her job They had no other problems They had one more child, Because of Rithika's infamy The boy's gone Then they got into trouble Last Randu .. Family Court ... Divorce Seven years now, After that, Ritika is no longer in the family again Sam, This is Abdul Wakhab sir Hello .. Retired FB Cecid Sir has some DNA samples We've taken samples from a nearby case Sam needs to check those two out Absolutely This Whose DNA is it, sir? This is from the cases we received while in the crime branch The only evidence from a case that has not been resolved Ritika's The first case of the profession, I did tests before retirement last case that It’s like early 2013 At Burma Colony outside Thiruvananthapuram And they found them when they were killed The nature of the wounds on the bodies of these victims The killer's killing pattern, These are the serial killer's we, They found a pattern of prey The killer based on that, Then we find out where the kidnapping takes place In search of the roads in this Burma colony, Out of a school van parked outside, The driver of that school van was arrested Here he is, Ubedan Ahmed, That he caught the cereal murderer in Burma Colony In the newspapers Channels have been published Ubedan is still in prison That's the pattern of injuries It's the same pattern of victimization Not even the police That's the highlight of it This fifth victim's nails were inside We got a blood sample The killer's, A sample that matches the DNA of the blood in the clothes of the first and second victims It didn't match Ubuden's DNA in prison Another unidentified person has committed the murder But finally We couldn't solve it But the message is very clear We got one loser So I stored the murderer's DNA in my possession I've done hundreds of DNA tests But, No matter how hard I try I couldn't find that killer Here Ubeydan Ahmed While in prison, this too was destroyed After my retirement, I kept mine This is our life, Sam That is what confuses us on the one hand On the other hand we have to solve for ourselves Ma'am, this guy lives on this side He works at a factory called Sport They have entered the factory without anybody I saw an incident there Fun tells Madam what you've seen He is. Do you know or know? Madam, Because the night of the event I didn't see that face, ma'am But .. He's not a big man, He's a 10 to 15 year old kid, madam Is the police trying to cover up this as a kid? Is this a story told by the police? If you see the guy in this photo somewhere Call our police emergency and inform When the press conference is over, we will give a copy of this to every channel All right Thanks Daniel, it's over Murali - Yes madam Send it everywhere Send this to all the channels, - Okay madam Each patrol was sent to Madam polakaṭama - right - Sam In my situation, I was a little hasty, But this case was solved today because of Sam's jungle theory It belongs to you What are you doing here? There's Alfons sir's class today, right? It's 1.00 now is the break Yes, .. come on then I'll show you someone Tell me ... Where's he cutting meat? Say hi to dad Hi Hi there How are you? What are you doing today? Lamb .. Lamb .. A tasty meal A tasty meal Daughter, I haven't forgotten my daughter's father Don't visit dad? Hello, Yes, Doctor I'll be right back Daughter is not angry His mother's very angry, Doctor, can I come? Come on, yes I'm not asking Ritika to come by me if that's not important - all right Got any info on the sketch released today ? No ... not yet Upon first seeing the sketch It's a boy who came with Jubileus for counsel The name is Reuben Elias He's gone now Looking at her case, Dr. Jayaraman, Clinical Therapist He's on vacation now A few years ago I was handed a student case Where the kids were playing together, Two of his friends were severely injured Then this kid was 8 years old I remember well the day I saw her for the first time He looked so innocent to me I still can't forget Somehow I started the therapy process With a lot of time and effort I was very close to him I continued to do so Get him under my watch About a year He was rescued by my side But one day .. It's all changed Rubin ... Who hadn't felt that many years ... The fierceness in his eyes I saw it again Rubin ... Rubin ... That was the last time I saw him I've been looking for Rubin's safe for so long Until I hear about this, Sam, Get your child killed This is enough His name and details are all in our hands Now I think this should be allowed in time For a little boy to be alone without any help You can't hide from such a large police force How's your mother? Can't say anything yet Is now in the ICU You come. All right Come on, wait here Mummy will be back soon Don't go anywhere, all right Transferred to ward today If you do ... Daughter. Malavika Das ... 6 years The last time I saw this kid was The place is now under our protection While the child is in the waiting room Mom, the kid disappeared while attending the ICU A chocolate from the coffee counter at the hospital, Malavika sir Missing at 10.15, yeah Then we .. I found a chocolate with a stick at the Wesmar Hospital Isn't that SP Ajayakal? They can do whatever they want with the money We have to do our job Isn't that the bill he got? Yes, sir With a boy, yes, Stay with him He was wearing hair Yeah, it was like that The evidence matches that crime Madam I have the same doubt This is a piece of chocolate from the counter, Cokalṭ bākōḍ one scan to the sense that She took the bill Malavika has also taken a packet of chocolate And then the guy at the counter .. Malavika confirms she's seen with Ruben Ma'am, there's nothing to think ... from the place where the chocolate was given Until Malavika's abduction, Reuben himself is quite clear that this is done Sir ... Leaving that chocolate, You can lead us astray What are you saying, Sam? Didn't find that chocolate in the trash? With my experience so far, Any bill or ticket see, There are only a few fresh roads Put it in your pocket, It's done throw trash basket dānakoṭa 's not like this little This child has disappeared Only at 10am A lot of people might just walk away No one's going to throw it in the trash Even if there was such a bill, It's mixed with other garbage This is the obvious thing Take it out of the hand and put it in the trash This is chocolate There is nothing dirty What does it mean What's Sam's idea? Malavika's abduction at a different time, This chocolate, That means we got this chocolate from the trash can at the front gate He's not hiding who he is That proves this Malavika's abduction What are you saying By 2:00 pm the province was in the police Hello, Does that mean Reuben brought the chocolate and left it? Of course, Meeting with the Commissioner, This is about it, come on, let's go What Damien said was true what? Whoever touches the chocolate buries his fingerprints As distinguished from the machine There is evidence that two people have this Malavika, touching one side of this cover, And the one who brought this, But his plan is to mislead the police Leaving that, It has The reason is this chocolate covered surface There are 5 - 7 mm size cotton pieces He might be using a glove If so, his fingerprints wo n't be covered in chocolate Bringing in a glove means he's trying to ruin his fingerprints But it's not that hard to find in the forensics department It's a cotton glove, It should be stored in his skin It must be DNA Get that device All right What kind of device is this for the labs? What's going on, Yes, This is a device that can be used to extract DNA Phonasic Vacuum Palm When we touch our clothes and weapons, The cells of our skin are deposited in the body So we can use this tool to distinguish it completely It touches the surface and contains the DNA of the one who touched it Yes, ma'am All right, madam Sam .. All right These are the DNA samples from the chocolate This is the DNA of Malavika from a piece of chocolate This is the DNA from the old asthma from the Jubilee Home The DNA of the person who touched the chocolate leaf Let's see if this fits in, The second time the chocolate hit, Not the series, Not Reuben There is an unidentified third Now we need to forget about Reuben We need to find out now ... A killer, We're in front of Wesmos Hospital now Unable to find a kid, When the police can't solve it The girl, who is publicly known as Malavika Das, has disappeared With this case in charge, About Ritika Xavier, There are accusations that they cannot be trusted Ma'am, the people are getting upset Looking to protect their children The parents of Den Lennie's school I am against sending children in school vans We have to get Reuben anyway Yes Sam, Mam, we got some clear evidence Lenny, get out of there not, This investigation has resolved, Don't make it worse The investigation team's goal is to capture Reuben Elias That's just it All right ma'am Sam, Forget about chocolate Indirectly saying that the judiciary does not need help, Come on some labs Duwa Nayani ... Sample the samples again I've checked this three times, Sam's DNA and DNA from Wahab Sir Burma's killer's bow samples Fits exactly, Sir, DNA from Malavika's chocolate leaf Sir has DNA Fits exactly, It's the same thing Even the murderers of the Burma murders 10 years ago Even the murderers behind the murder of children in this city One Is this what you guys Burmah murderers bodies'll place Hmm .. Ararikum, Niserville We got the bodies of three children right here He had been stabbed to death with a weapon Coming from the city to such a great environment, The killer's bringing bodies to such an open space While investigating the sir's police team in those days Not as much going into the interior So, naturally, their signs are gone the truth Contact a pipe company and tell them to bring an underground search tool Hmm Let's find the story on this lake Yes ma'am Hello Zika How did I get you to work? What kind of information Madame Sam is trying to compare the child's autopsy All right Recently, I went to Shika Karyakulam with Sam Hello, Mam, we went on a little trip See your personal belongings on vacation Send me those reports when they're done Definitely, right Who's talking? It's a personal call Ritika Xavier Tanuma Murali Mohan Kumar What's this, Sam? So far in this case, there is nothing we can do We have to try But we need help from Wagab and Alfonsu The day Malavika's abduction took place Vesmōr hospital CCTV camera had been recording Here is a list of people who came along with the police One name from this list, The name of the murderer we're looking for So All of the DNA here is assembled Must match the killer's samples There are 60 to 70 names on this list Does the murderer, whoever he is, give us samples of DNA? not So we have to collect samples without them knowing Half of the list included samples of myself and Shikai Wahhab sir collects the rest of his DNA Alphonse's Doctor Wellsmore Hospital Absolutely The chocolate leaf is the killer's DNA All you need to do is mix it up Along with us There is no shortage Shika, Now we need to collect samples of the remaining ones on this list Until the killer's DNA is found, What happened?
