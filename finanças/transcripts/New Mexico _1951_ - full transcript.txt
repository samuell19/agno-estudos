[boisterous orchestral music] [hollering] [upbeat orchestral music] - [Man] Mr. President. - [Man] Present! [hollering] - Thank you, Major. - Rough riding, Mr. President. - Oh, I'm used to it. Cavalry horses ride smoother than an arm chair in the White House. - Mr. Lincoln used to be in the Cavalry, Major. In the Illinois volunteer, Captain Abe Lincoln. - Where is Lieutenant Hunt, Major? - Mr. Hunt. - I'm glad to meet you, Lieutenant. I want to thank you for excellence of your reports on the Indian situation here in New Mexico territory. - I thank you, sir. I'd like to share that honor with our Indian scout. Corporal Coyote. - At any rate, I'm here because of the fine work of your men, thank you. Judge Wilcox, I'd like to meet Acoma now. - Certainly, Mr. President, would you just step this way? [stately orchestral music] [mumbles] All right, Acoma, step forward. Come alone, come along. - Mr. Hunt, takeover. - Yes, sir. [speaking in foreign language] Mr. President, allow me to present, Acoma, war chief of the Indian nations of the New Mexico territory. [mumbles] - I'm delighted. [speaking in foreign language] I cannot speak the language of your people, Acoma. But I have learned to say, we meet as friends. [speaking in foreign language] - Mr. President, Acoma speaks English. - Well I should think he would, Judge. His family's been in the country longer than any of ours. - The great white father honors his [mumbles]. As our hands were jostling in friendship, so may we end all our people for red and white. [mumbles] in peace. - I wish it with all my heart. - Only evil man [mumbles] can break this friendship. - Then let each of us with evil men among us, Acoma, you as chief of your people, and I as President of mine, so may we live and work together, many people, but one nation. Judge Wilcox, will you be good enough to hand me the presentation for Acoma? I present this to you in the name and with the good will of the people of the United States of America. And now, farewell. [speaking in foreign language] [hollering] - Soldiers! [yelling] [upbeat orchestral music] [gun shot blasting] [dramatic orchestral music] - Get out! Don't want Indians around here! - Hello. - What's going on here, Sergeant? Where you taking these men? - They're under arrest, Captain. - For what? - Stealing rations, sir. Food belongs to them, Harrison, let 'em go. - Colonel McComb's orders, Captain. - All right, go ahead, I'll speak to the Colonel. [mumbles] - Whoa! Howdy' Captain! Got some mail there for ya. - All right, throw it over. - Oh, sorry Captain, I ain't the shooter I used to was. - Good morning, Major. - [mumbles] ma'am, morning. - Are we near Fort Union? - You'll be there in a few minutes, ma'am. - Hallelujah, we know every bump in this road 'tween here and Kansas City. We're only halfway to where we're going. - Bound for Las Vegas, ma'am? - Yes, we have an engagement there. This is my niece, Cherry, the well known entertainer, in the theater. - Captain Hunt, ma'am. - How do you do? I'm Mrs. Fenway, her manager. You've heard of Cherry, I'm sure. - Well, I-- - I'm afraid we're holding up the coach, Captain. Are there any accommodations at Fort Union? - Oh you'd be most welcome, I'm sure. - Will we be seeing you there? - [Captain] I'd be honored to show you around, ma'am. - Thank you. I'll be looking forward to-- - Indians! - Better go ahead Bertie. - Giddy up, [mumbles]. - All right, Acoma, I know what this is all about. - My braves must be released. - They'll be trouble if you come busting into the fort like this. You better let me handle it, there's some mistake. - First two time maybe, third time not Captain. - All right, follow me, I'll get it fixed. [dramatic orchestral music] [hollering] - Let's go see who's in the coach, guys. - Expecting somebody [mumbles]? - Wah-hoo, it's Cherry! [yelling] - Attention! Make way for [mumbles]-- [yelling over each other] - Put me down, boys. Put me down, I said. - Gettin' fancy, huh Cherry? You didn't act so fancy in Kansas City when the boys-- [hand smacking] - [Captain] Wait here, Acoma. - Captain Hunt! Hello. - Hello. - Ready to be shown around. - Sorry, I'll be busy. I'd like to request the release of Acoma's three men, Colonel McComb. - Request denied. Anything else? - May I respectfully remind you, sir, that this is a violation of treaty. - I'll rule on that, Captain Hunt. They were arrested for stealing, they're a pack of thieves and beggars. - I'm sorry, sir, I can't agree with that. The Indians were taking supplies that belong to them. That are being withheld illegally. - They're getting their supplies that the law provides. If they claim otherwise, they're lying. - I claim otherwise, Mr. Commissioner. I claim they're being cheated and robbed and it's bound to lead to trouble. - Are you daring to suggest that-- - Captain Hunt, if you or the Indians have any accusations to make against the Commissioner, they'll be made through channels. - Some of those channels are clogged, sir. Hungry men getting impatient. - There are ways of dealing with impatiences, Hunt. You'll follow me and I'll show you how we treated smart Indians in the old army. That's an order. - Yes, sir. - [Colonel] Get out of this fort, Acoma. And take those braves with ya. - You will release my men first, Colonel. If they have done wrong, I will have them punished. - You'll have them punished? - We have our own laws, ancient tribal laws. Your President gave us the authority to judge our own people. - I don't recognize your authority. When you or any of your people break the laws, we'll do the punishing. Now get! Arrest them! Stop those Indians! - [Captain] Don't shoot! - You heard my orders, fire! [gun shot blasting] - Great white father is dead. But his heart could live. You have stopped it again. - Lock him up. - I owe you a debt, Colonel McComb. Judge Wilcox. I will pay it. - [Captain] Colonel McComb. - What do you want, Hunt? - Sir, I request permission to file charges with the Secretary of War concerning the killings that have just taken place. - Request denied. You're under arrest for attempting to counter command a superior officer's orders. As such, you have no legal right till it's cleared by court's marshal. You will confine yourself to quarters. - Yes, sir. [somber orchestral music] Acoma? [speaking in foreign language] A long time ago you said that no matter what happens, these words would remind us that we are friends. Will you say them? - The friendship is broken. You just tasted the blood of my worries that cries out for vengeance. - I understand how you feel. Anyway, take this back. Belongs to you. If you're planning to raise the hatchet, Acoma, don't. It'd be a big mistake. - Indians aren't afraid to die, Captain Hunt. - I know that. But you're letting a few evil men make you forget all the good that's been done. - Souls of my dead warriors will not rest until their murderers lie beside them. - We have laws, too, Acoma. They take a little time, but the men who ordered your men shot will be punished. That I promise. - Promises of white men are like dust in the wind. - Listen to me, Acoma, I'm your friend, but if you take the law into your own hands there will be war and you'll make me your enemy. Don't do that. Give me some sign to your braves not to raise the hatchet. - The hatchet is already raised. [suspenseful orchestral music] [hatchet thumping] [dramatic orchestral music] [knife thuds] - First of my debts has been paid, Captain Hunt. Do not come after me. But there will be more. - Good! I'll alert the Post! [horn tooting] - Gary! [hollering over each other] - Acoma! [mumbles] - No chance catch Acoma at night. - Is that what you're hoping you dog eating-- - All right, break it up! As you were Anderson! - We've got Captain Hunt to thank for this, you know that? - What's the matter? What's happened-- - Indian attack, Colonel McComb's been murdered. - Oh no! - Now, now, now, it'll be all right, it'll be all right. [sobbing] - Take it easy, Feather. - [Man] Here comes Captain Hunt! - Any luck, Captain? - Too dark, not a chance. Double the guards, sergeant. Order all troops out, full field equipment. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Vermont. - Yes, sir? - Troops AD will remain to guard the fort. All civilians to be evacuated to Fort Reed, two platoons to escort them. All transportation west is suspended until further notice. - [Mr. Vermont] Yes, sir. - I want volunteers for a small patrol to leave at dawn. There's a chance to settle this thing without war if we don't go out to strength. Before you decide I want to warn you that it's a dangerous chance. But I think it'll work. All right, who's coming? - Sergeant Garrity, sir! - Van Vechton. - Anderson-- [talking over each other] - Good, we'll travel light, sergeant. Five days ration. Let us see that these men get some sleep, there won't be much from here on. - Yes, sir. All right, get your tack together and hit the sack on the double! - Captain Hunt! We don't wish to go east. - There's a stage leaving tomorrow. You better take it. - We happen to want to go west, is that any of your business? - Yes, it's my business, Acoma's Indians are moving that way, I've stopped all traffic west. - The judge offered to take us to Santa Fe. - No dice. Not Santa Fe or Albuquerque or Tucson either. - He asked us to leave. - Stop being fancy, they run us out. Couldn't you make that Las Vegas, Judge? - Captain Hunt wouldn't like that, would he? Mr. Vermont. I think that you should insist that Captain Hunt turn the command over to you. - You do? - Yes, because I doubt his fitness or his desire to catch Acoma, and furthermore, he's under arrest. I myself heard the Colonel order it. - I didn't hear a thing, Judge. [knocking] - Come in. Yes, Mr. Vermont? - Captain, might it be better if I took this patrol out alone? - What do you mean by that? - Just a suggestion, sir. - We leave at dawn, Mr. Vermont. Under my command. - Yes, sir. [upbeat orchestral music] [wind howling] [dramatic orchestral music] - Which way do the tracks go, Coyote? - Always our tribe move. Take everyone, squalls, little ones, [mumbles]. Seen war, Captain. [wind drowns out speakers] If I know Acoma, he's gonna try and take the [mumbles]. - That's what we're trying to prevent, Mr. Vermont. Pack the horses, Coyote. [hollering] [wind howling] [dramatic orchestral music] - I don't think they should be pushed much further, Captain. The horses or men. - It's what Acoma thinks. He's pushing horses and men, too. - No disrespect sir, just curiosity. You're getting further away from the fort. You don't know where Acoma's going. You're running low on rations, water and morale. My book doesn't tally. - Acoma didn't learn tactics from a book at West Point, Mr. Vermont. - Anyway, how do you intend to find him? - I don't. Think he'll find us. Mount! - Tired Serg? - This is one of the times in my life I wish I was in the Navy. - Yeah, sure is peaceful, the ocean. - Nothing but blue skies and water. And just kinda [mumbles]. [gun shot blasting] [hollering] [gun shots blasting] - Mount! Hold it! - Looks like Acoma's found us, Captain. Are we going after 'em? - We won't be going in that direction, Mr. Vermont. [dramatic orchestral music] - I'm all mixed up I can't figure out whether it's been a 1,000 or 1500 years I've been stuck in this saddle. I've got calluses crampin' my neck. [mumbles] - Ah, laugh you jug heads. Get knocked off one at a time. Not even a man stands to hit back. - Cheever? Cheever, you're dead in your saddle. - No, keep your hands off me I'm riding, ain't I? [hollering] - [Captain] What happened here? - He got himself hung up. No bones broken, I think. - I'm sorry about this, sir, couldn't help it. - You all right? - Yes. - Sergeant Garrity? - [Sergeant] Yes, sir. - See to Private Cheever's horse, Sergeant. - Yes, sir. That shoe is gone. By the looks of things, it's been off of their a couple of days, why didn't you report it? - When, there ain't no time to stop. - If I catch you guys mistreating these horses anymore, I'll knock your teeth out. - Care more about the horses than you do about the men. - It's a lot tougher to replace a good horse. - Just fix it, Sergeant. Let's save the fighting for the Indians. - Yes, sir. - Why didn't you, Lieutenant? - Look at him with that shrew. He's acting more like General Grant everyday. - The men are in bad shape, Captain. Including those that don't fall. - How are the supplies? - Water's about gone. Rations for about a day. - We'll go on for another day then, as soon as the horses are ready. - I'd like to respectfully remind you, sir, it's five days back to the fort. - Well aware of that, Mister. I got a belly full of this. I thought you were in to kill Indians? - I didn't want to run away from 'em. - [Man] Shut up, Anderson, you want him to hear ya? - Let him hear me! I'm sick of this, when do we get a chance to fight? - Yeah, let's fight or turn back. - Did I hear someone say who's tired? Anybody want me to call this off and go back to Fort Union? Private Clifton, do you wanna go back? - Why no, sir. - [Captain] Corporal Mack? [mumbles] - [Corporal Mack] Not me, Captain. - Daniels, Harrison, Vale, Parsons? - I'm not going. - I'm tired. - Anderson? - I'm sticking. - Good, fine. Everybody wants to keep going. But you're all liars! Liars, every good covered stale one of ya! I guess that includes me. Sure aren't lying as hard as the rest of ya. We're all sick of riding. We wanna a bath, hot grub and a bed. I want to sleep without dreaming about bullets in our backs. But that's not for us. Not yet. I don't know what you think of Indians, I don't care. When it comes to this kind of fighting, they got guts and stamina and brains. When we started out I thought we'd find Acoma in a couple of days. He's still ahead of us. But we're gonna track him down. We're gonna bring him back. Or we're staying. And that's it! Staying! Mr. Vermont! - [Mr. Vermont] Yes, sir! - Are we ready to mount? - We're ready sir. - Take 10 minutes rest. - Hey, how about a slug of your water? - Get your own. - Yup, I guess that Serg would like to hear about this. - Open your trap and I'll fill it with lead. - I'd rather have it filled with what ya got there. How about it? - Three bucks a swig. - Three bucks? I only make $16 a month. - Three bucks. - It's called rock with wings, Captain. - I know, Coyote. [speaking in foreign language] Ever been up to the Pueblo on top? - No, no, forbidden, very sacred to Indian. Built long time ago, before Columbus. Then Spanish come, attack Indian on top. - I wouldn't try it without artillery. - Many Spanish died, take 11 day. They have guns, the Indian only bow and arrow. Rocks, Spanish get up, build church. Then earthquake break up only trail. Everyone die. - You mean nobody could get up there even if they tried? - Indian who want to bad enough can go anywhere. - Well you're an Indian, Coyote. And a soldier. That's why we're going. [horn tooting] - Away [hollering]. Go! [suspenseful orchestral music] - Halt! Dismount! - Are you thinking of climbing that, Captain? - That's the idea, Mr. Vermont. Coyote, Garrity. - Yes, sir? - I want you, Harrison, Anderson, Daniels and Lindley, and rifles and one canteen of water on the double. - Yes, sir. - Have the rest of the men cover us as we climb. We run into trouble don't come up, just get the men back to the fort. You'll find a water hole if you go back by way of Temple Dome. - [Man] Lead the way, Coyote. [suspenseful orchestral music] - [mumbles] Garrity, Daniels, come with me. The rest of you go with Harrison. And watch it. [dramatic orchestral music] I had a hunch we'd find something here. Guess I was wrong. [bell chiming] Come on! [suspenseful orchestral music] - Hey! [gun shot blasting] - I thought we was after Indians, Captain. - Couldn't you see they were kids? - They grow up. - Take his gun, Daniels. [punch thudding] - He's dead, Captain. - I'm sorry about this, but why did you ring that bell? Who were you trying to signal? All right, son. - I'm not your son. Your soldier killed my brother. Some day I kill him. - I could make him talk if you'd let me. - I'll bet you could. Get out of my sight! Acoma's boy, aren't you? Well let's get down to the bottom as fast as we can, and we'll warn the men to be on alert for an attack. Lindley, you stay here, keep your eyes open, fire a shot if you see anything on the horizon. - Yes, sir. Garrity, take care of the boy. Come on, Coyote. - Come on, Charlie. - What is it, Coyote? - Too many horses coming. - Hold it! Are you sure, Coyote? I can see for miles, not a trace. Maybe it's our own horses below. - Maybe so. [gun shots blasting] [intense orchestral music] [hollering] - Come on down quick! [suspenseful orchestral music] [yelling] [intense orchestral music] [yelling] [gun shots blasting] - [mumbles] don't kill me! - All right, come on. [gun shots blasting] - [mumbles] bullets like [mumbles] speed. Take it off. - No, no, feather bring good luck. A high honor for Indian. Always must wear it. - Hogwash. [gun shots blasting] - We stopped 'em! - Don't have refreshment. Here's your three bucks. - The situation's changed, six bucks. - Six bucks? - Six bucks take it or don't. - I'll take it. Pay ya later. - One swig, any more and it comes out through your neck. Start. - Hold your fire! He wants a truce. - Captain Hunt! - Stay down and be quiet, Charlie. - I warn you not to come up to me, Captain. We can kill you all now. That is still not my wish. We will allow you and your men to return to the fort, safely. - We'd be glad to. We want you to come with us. - I always know you are a brave man, Captain. I did not think you a fool. - You're right, Acoma, I'm not. You killed four of my men trying to lead us away from this rock. We're here, you tried to ambush us and failed. You attacked us and were beaten off. - The attack made you use bullets, Captain. - A lot of them found their mark. - But you have not many more left. Not bullets, not food. Not water. Go! Take this water and go. - Why are you so anxious to get us away from rock with wings, Acoma? - Live while you can, Captain. - Charlie! [speaking in foreign language] - I want my boy. I also want the man who killed my oldest son. - Your boy will be safer with us. The man who killed your other son will be punished. You must return to face your punishment too, Acoma. Or else we will fight. - Each of us must do what he believes is right, Captain. I have 1,000 well armed men. Many more tribes will join me. We let you think awhile. Then we fight. - Wait! No, wait. He's offering a truce. You can't turn down a truce! Wait! [mumbles] how dare you turn down Acoma's truce. What right have you got to expose us to certain death? We're not your soldiers. I accept, Acoma. Acoma, Acoma! - I did not know the judge was in the coach. The terms have changed. I want him, too. - You asked for the truce, we'll make the terms. - Prepare to die, Captain. You will need this. [gun shot blasting] [dramatic orchestral music] - Gather all canteens, remaining supplies, and ammunition. Link the horses, we're going to the top. Everyone, climb to the top! [somber orchestral music] - I just can't go another step. - Captain Hunt, you don't expect us to climb any further, do you? - I don't see that you have any other alternative. - These women are exhausted, they've been through torture. - They were given orders not to come this way. They disregarded them. You can stay down here, if you'd like, we're going to the top. - [Judge] You mean you deserted-- - Never mind, Judge. We'll go on. - Harrison, Finnegan. Help the ladies. - Easy now, feathers, take a deep breaths. Upsee-daisies. - I don't remember you turning in your canteen, trooper. - It was empty, I left it below. All right. I'll trade you, and it ain't water. - I'll talk to you on top. [dramatic orchestral music] - More braves joined Acoma while you were climbing, sir. - Well just keep watching them, Lindley. - Yes, sir. - Issue one ration of water all around, only one. - We certainly could have used the water Acoma offered us, sir. - That was another decoy, Mr. Vermont, to keep us from looking around up here. Now you organize a search detail, I think you'll find water. Maybe something more. - Yes, sir. - Let's go, Coyote. [somber orchestral music] - Does Hunt think he's gonna find water under these rocks? - Hard enough to hit 'em with a bullet, now we're gonna throw rocks at 'em. - What's a matter, Serg? - I wonder if it's too late to join the Navy? [somber orchestral music] - Fire not good, Indian makes better. - What's a matter with it? - White men make big fire. Sit back, Indian make small fire. Sit near. - Oh, they're just too lazy to get wood, Charlie. - Should have gone to West Point. All you do is carry two bars and give orders. - [Man] I don't know what to do with all my spare time now. - Oh, Acoma ain't gonna give you as much spare time as you think. - Can't you get him out of here? Haven't there a few minutes rest without an Indian drilling me with his eyes? Go on, get out of here! - Come on, Charlie. He is kinda a big soldier, come on. We'll stay over here, Charlie. - You like be Charlie's friend? - Why I am your friend. - I give you present. Old Indian owl head. - Well, thanks Charlie. - We friends? - Shake. - Now you give Charlie present. - Anything you want, Charlie. - I want gun. - Gun? - I kill him. - Oh, now Charlie, you can't do that. - No more friend. - Indian giver. - Captain Hunt, I, we shouldn't have come. I'll never get off the top of this rock alive. - Don't you believe it, feathers. Show you my faith in the future I'm hereby proposing to you, we'll get married in San Francisco, with all the trimmings. It'll be just like St. Louis. Remember the night released that steamboat man? - Oh, the way the champagne flowed. The drinks I've passed up in my time. Oh, what I wouldn't give for one right now. - A little extra ration on Private Parsons. [coughing] - I thought it was water. - Where did you get this? [sighing] Daniels, Parsons, I'm real obliged to ya. Show you my gratitude, how about a little game. - Oh Andrew, you never change. How can you think of gambling when we may be murdered any minute? - You mean them Indians? Let 'em come, they got Wampum, I'll play 'em. All right, gentleman, gather round. Keep your mind off your troubles and get rich at the same time. Serry, Matildy, and Little Joe, who never got his face washed. [laughing] - [Man] Here we are. All right. - Acoma stirring, sir? - Not yet, Sergeant. But he will be. If I know him, he's determined to get up here at all costs. - [Sergeant] Those rocks'll hold him. - We can stop most of them, but some will get through. We gotta get word back to Fort Union. - I'll go. - I'd like to try it. - I can make it, Captain. - We'll draw for this one. It's a long chance, I want it equal. - How about high card, sir? - All right, Sergeant. Just for luck, suppose you let someone else deal? - Certainly, sir. I'll just stir 'em a bit. - You cut 'em, feathers. - Four. - Six. - Five. - Nine. - Eight. - Seven. - Fine, seven. - Nine. - King. - Just a minute, Sergeant. Let's give you another cut. Any one off the top. - Little Joe. Feathers, my love, there's my dowry. See you in Frisco. Good hunting, troopers. [somber orchestral music] - I didn't help him, much. - He always like his odds long, Lieutenant. - You still acting fancy, Cherry? - Let her go! How about a song, Cherry? - [Men] Yeah, Cherry. - I don't feel much like singing, boys. - Oh go ahead, Cherry, it'll perk everybody up and make you feel better, too. - Okay, Serg, just for you. ♪ Soldier, soldier won't you marry me now ♪ ♪ With your rifle, fife and drum ♪ ♪ How can I marry such a pretty girl as you ♪ ♪ When I've got no hat to put on ♪ ♪ When I've got no hat to put on ♪ ♪ Go off to the hat shop she did go ♪ ♪ Hard as she could run ♪ Brought him back the finest that there was ♪ ♪ And the soldier put it on ♪ And the soldier put it on ♪ Soldier, soldier won't you marry me now ♪ ♪ With your rifle, fife and drum ♪ ♪ How can I marry such a pretty girl as you ♪ ♪ When I've got no coat to put on ♪ ♪ When I've got no coat to put on ♪ ♪ So off to the tailor she did go ♪ ♪ As hard as she could run ♪ Brought him back the finest that there was ♪ ♪ And the soldier put it on ♪ And the soldier put it on ♪ Soldier, soldier won't you marry me now ♪ ♪ With your rifle, fife and drum ♪ ♪ How can I marry such a pretty girl as you ♪ ♪ When I've got no shoes to put on ♪ ♪ When I've got no shoes to put on ♪ ♪ So off to the shoe shop she did go ♪ ♪ As hard as she could run ♪ Brought him back the finest that there was ♪ ♪ And the soldier put them on ♪ And the soldier put them on ♪ Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me now ♪ ♪ With your rifle, fife and drum ♪ ♪ How can I marry such a pretty girl as you ♪ ♪ With a wife and baby at home ♪ With a wife and baby at home - Come on, Cherry, do it like you used to do it in Kansas City!

I can't give orders to them, but I can give 'em to you. From now on if I catch any man even talking to one of the civilians, he's going down off this rock on his own. So the rest of us can stay here and fight. Indians. - I'd be your friend. - Oh thanks, Charlie. - Are you thirsty? - Yes, very. - You come with me. - You know where there's water? - It's a secret. - Is this where the water is? [water trickling] - Good? - Oh I can't tell you how good. - Do not tell anyone. It's a secret. With you, me. - Please listen to me, Charlie. - No! - Try to understand. We can't let anybody die. Even when we hate them. - You break promise! - Charlie! Charlie. I know how you feel. But I've got to tell 'em about this too. Don't you see, it might keep a lot of people from being killed, yours and mine. Come with me. [gentle orchestral music] - Where've you been? - None of your business. - Where were you? Water, you found water! Where's the water? - [Cherry] Let go of me! [water trickling] - Charlie, she's going to tell them about these guns. That won't be good for Acoma. It won't be good for me either. Charlie, listen, you know the way down the trail in the dark, don't you? Oh, I don't mean that you should go alone. I'll go along with you and I'll help you. It would be a fine brave thing for you to do. And your father'd be so proud of you. And he'd be so happy he'd let me go free. Oh show me the way through the trail, will you, Charlie? - Soldiers stop you. - Oh, don't worry about that. I'll get you by the soldiers. I'll sneak you by, just you and me, we'll sneak by. Charlie, just think, you can save your father. Will ya, Charlie? That's the boy, that's a boy. We'll get out of here. - Captain Hunt, Captain Hunt! Water, guns, I found them. - What are talking about? - The Indian boy, he showed me where the water is. Guns and ammunition are hidden there, too. - Where? - [Cherry] I'll show you. - So this is what Acoma was after. Brand new, repeating rifles. And enough ammunition to supply the five nations. [dramatic orchestral music] - You can call off the search for the Judge and the Indian boy. - [Mr. Vermont] He'll know we found the guns now. - Wait, wait Charlie. Wait. We'll beg your father. Now you tell him I brought you down, won't you? You tell him I did it for you, won't you? - Not do for me, do for you. - No, wait Charlie! No, wait Charlie, tell him I'm your friend! [speaking in foreign language] Acoma! I brought you your son down. I brought you, didn't I? Didn't I? I saved him for you. I don't want any reward for it. I just want you to let me go. Acoma, I know that you Indians have been mistreated. And when you do let me go, I'm going to Washington and I'll do something about it. I'll get him to do something about it and I'll get a full pardon for you. Because I'm your friend. Do you remember? I was with President Lincoln, do you remember? - Acoma remembers. - Yeah, well. He would want you to let me go. The government will be very mad if you don't let me go, Acoma. [speaking in foreign language] What are you gonna do, Acoma? Acoma, look, I've got a beautiful present for you, it's pure gold, gold just for you. Absolutely pure gold and it's all for you. Acoma, all gold, just to let me go. [speaking in foreign language] [yelling] [dramatic orchestral music] [mumbles] Acoma! Acoma! - We can expect the attack any minute. - How do you get transferred out of this outfit? - [mumbles] attack now, Captain, better let me go for help. Only Indian can get through. You will let Coyote go, not lose more men. - All right, Coyote, go ahead. Good luck. Alert the men, Sergeant. - Oh, yeah. [intense orchestral music] [gun shot blasting] [suspenseful orchestral music] [gun shots blasting] - Light your torches! [dramatic orchestral music] Release trails! Cut your ropes! [gun shots blasting] - You're hurt, Captain. Let me help. - I'm all right. You gotta get through [mumbles]. - Put your arm around me. [gun shots blasting] - Get the candle. Get the blanket. Get on the ladder. You better go on up now. - I'm not going without you. - Go up I told you! [gun shots blasting] [mumbles] - That's all right. It's good to be needed and liked. I haven't had much of that in my life. - I'm sorry I didn't see that part of you before. Maybe if we'd met separately. [speaking in foreign language] - The guns, they are burning. [dramatic orchestral music] - Acoma! [gun shot blasting] Take the boy and go. It's your life and his and others now. Hurry, hurry. [dramatic orchestral music] [explosion booming]
