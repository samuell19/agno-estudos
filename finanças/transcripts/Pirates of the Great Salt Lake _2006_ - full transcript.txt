Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [soft beeps] There's a legend around these parts, still told now and again. Most people don't believe it, but... some still do. A young man, a farm hand, wanted to marry the love of his life. She was pregnant with his child, but he... Well, he had nothing to offer her. I'm going to the mountains. I'll find our fortune, okay? I love you. Goodbye. Narrator: And the very next morning, the young man did. He walked west for a calendar or two, searching the countryside for their fortune, finding everything but. Until one day, the young man happened upon fate. What dost thou seek? My fortune. What's in this one? This shall be thy guide. [sighs] Narrator: The map led to a mountain cave. Of course, the young man shouldn't have gone there. No, not at all. That cave was cursed. ♪ [music] ♪ [heavy thud] [beastly growl] -[metal clanking] -[thudding] Man: Oh, shit. [beastly growls] [bones crack] [man struggles] [ripping] [screams] Narrator: See, the cave was a tomb. [water dripping] What does that have to do with the story you're here sitting in front of? Well now, that's the question, ain't it? Ahoy, Captain! Captain! Spotted a vessel not two marks off the port bow. That way. Looks to be an English skipper. I don't know, maybe Spanish. It's bound to be loaded with rich cargo. That's, uh-- That's lunch, sir. Keep at it, Flint! We're gaining on her! Shall I raise the flag now, Captain? Wait for it. Now! [screams into loud speaker] Your attention please, do not panic. Hello. We simply require that you choose between your goods or your lives. Don't move, or you'll be breathing out of a hole in your neck! [yelps] [coughs] I can't swim! Kirk: Calm down. You forget, you can't drown in these waters. You may have escaped with your precious cargo today, but mark my words, you may not be as lucky tomorrow. [growls] Yeah laugh it up, funny boy! Quickly. [growls] Perhaps if we had some real swords, sir. Real swords? Uh... These weapons are very real. I fashioned them myself. I mean, we need metal swords, sir. What we need is a worthy meal. There's something in my shoe. Hello... Sure is. This looks promising. We must have it examined immediately. Immediately. Oh, uh... ♪ [upbeat music] ♪ Woman: Mmm... [chuckles] [gasps] Oh. Well, boys, either it's real or it's fake. -That's encouraging. -I hope it's the first. Has to be one of the two. Hey, Captain, it says right here there's a school in the south Pacific where they'll train us to be real pirates. We are real pirates. Tuition seems reasonable. Oh! Financial aid is-- Quit, or you're second mate. -I am second mate. -No, you're first mate. I do both. Woman: Ah, now. This one was real. [gasps in surprise] -[phone rings] -Oh. Yes? Oh! I'll be right there. [phone hangs up] No. -Flint? -Aye, Captain? Are you carrying your library card? Let's just see here. I don't know if I happen to have it. Quickly. Oh, I'm sorry, but you can't check this book out. It's from general reference. How silly of us, to think we could borrow a book from the library! We can only do what we must. Careful then. Wait. [printer whirring] Kirk: It's a shame, I can't decipher it. A pirate map is only good to the pirate who made it. Well, we just have to find the starting point. Yes, thank you. I'm well aware. Has this no frame of reference? This map is worthless. Flint, what does every pirate have? Parrot. Besides a parrot. Muskets? Besides muskets. Tattoos. I'll tell you, it's an earring. And I've noticed you wearing one from time to time. Oh, yeah. It's my nana's. I took it off 'cause it was giving me an infection. -[sighs] -Well, from now on, they are permanent fixtures. Very good. Did I ever tell you why I decided to take up our chosen profession? It all started three weeks ago, before I met you. My mother walked in on me in a rather... compromising situation. [vigorous rubbing] -[moans from TV] -[clashing metal] [rapid knocking on door] Mom! Oh! [gasp] Oh! [pants nervously] How dare you! Bringing this filth into my house? Your father would roll over in his grave. -Don't do that. -Tomorrow, I am calling the doctor first thing in the morning. We will cure you of this perversity. I am not sick. Kirk, it's not natural. I am a pirate. Why can't you accept that? Stop speaking in that horrible accent! You... are not a pirate! The sea is my home now. We are ships without anchors. We're pirates without a ship. What's wrong with our ship? She's not exactly seaworthy, Captain. It's hardly a scratch. We could patch this up. Goodnight. Goodnight, Flint. [laughter] Man: Look man, I told you somebody stole it! Man 2: Are you sure that's ours? Man: Duh! What're you doing in my tent, man? [screams] Kirk: Row, my good man! Row like you've never rowed before! Flint: Captain, I've been thinking about the map. Perhaps we should go hunt for its treasure. Pirates don't hunt for treasure. They bury it. I mean, we bury it. Okay? We have no treasure to bury, sir. It is our duty, then, to acquire some, Gilligan. You know I don't like it when you say that, sir. Sorry. Flint: [sighs] I just happen to think we should search for the treasure. -It seems like a-- -[scoffs] The fools. Look at them, carelessly flaunting their goods before us. To the oars, Flint. We take our share now. [screaming menacingly] Look, Dad! Pirates! I hate pirates. Dad, be nice for once. [panting] Do not panic. We simply require that you choose between your goods or your lives. Oh! You're talented! You're almost as good as the pirates at Disneyland! Come on and sit down! Dad's fixing hamburgers. I hate Disneyland. Oh, Dad don't be silly. You love it there! I repeat! Your goods or your lives. You could work at that one show in Las Vegas. Dad! What's that called again? I hate shows? You want ketchup? Please, m'lady, the goods or your lives. Certainly are persistent. Does he ever break character? Here you go, boys! Enjoy! Begging you pardon, ma'am. It's kinda an ethical issue. See, Captain Kirk can't eat anything he doesn't steal. It's the pirate's way. I hate Star Trek. Well then, I withdraw my invitation. You may not have any of my food. Flint: Captain. I stole these when she had her back turned. Don't. Okay? Don't try to cheer me up, Flint. It's no good. Do you know what our problem is? Mm. -Financing, sir? -[scoffs] -[coughs] -No. It's that... -It's that damn Johnny Depp. -Mm. You know? Ever since he started playing a pirate, everybody-- everybody thinks we're cute. Nobody fears us anymore, we're just, "Oh, it's a cute little pirate." He does do a fine job, sir. Nobody wears better eye shadow, ay, well next to you. -Of course. -Thank you. You know, perhaps if we attended that pirate school? I just don't think it's working out. Maybe my mom was right, you know? [laughs] Maybe it's time to lower the flag. Sir, what about the map? The map, what? Finding that treasure could be the answer to all our problems. I mean, we could buy a proper ship, we could hire a menacing, bloodthirsty crew. We could buy real swords and girlfriends and... We'd be the fiercest pirates on the planet. You know, Flint, I've been thinking about that map. And I think it's time we put together an expedition. Aye aye, Captain. But first, we'll need provisions. -Provisions. -Yes. -Kirk: We're Louis and Clark. -[growls] Kirk: Huckleberry Fin and Tom Sawyer! Flint: We're Siegfried and Roy! Kirk: No, we're not. Flint: Alright then, we're Superman and Aquaman. Kirk: You're Aquaman! [panting] Hi. Your goods or your life. Who are you? What are you doing? [yelling] Hey! Wait a minute! Come back here! [woman yelling] Bring back those brownies! It's a good chip count, but it's a bit dry for my taste. -Flint: Blimey. -Kirk: Well done, chap. [Kirk chuckles] [mystical harp chord] Avast, Captain. What's that look like to you? Kirk: It looks like a coincidence. [touch-tone beeps] Ahoy there, ma'am. We was just wondering what you're doing in the buried treasure business? See, we happen to have a treasure map with your company's logo right on it. -[inaudible] -Uh-huh. Yeah, the image of Mount Crevice. Ah, yeah. And where might this Mount Crevice be? Yeah, uh, I'm sorry, which lake? Oh, you mean the Great Sea. Well, no I do not think it's an inland lake. Well, the salt water for one. [blows air] Hello? -[replaces phone on receiver] -Captain! We have hornswaggled ourselves, see? It's not Mount Crevice Real Estate we're after, it's Mount Crevice herself! [sighs] Ha! [growls] Kirk: Oh, Flint. Look! That's where we met. Flint: Mm.

I was just wondering, if you were done, maybe you could come with us. -Oh. -You know, if you-- Flint, you're so sweet. That's just not for me. Oh. Alright. Well, uh...

They comfort me. Do you know why? Give you a sense of direction, sir? Of belonging. The sea is my home, the heavens my roof. It has been the same for every pirate since the beginning.

I want to be the first to be inside of it. -Look at that! -Drake: Where? Ow! Kirk: The treasure's back here, chap! -Flint: Where are you? -Kirk: Keep walking! [bats squeak] -Amazing. -Don't touch me treasure! He's not going to. -I was not gonna what, sir? -That's what they all say. Then they fall victim to the siren's call of this damned curse. No, not this one. He's smart. He knows it's cursed. Who are you talking to? Old fakey here. Fake pirate. -I'm not a fake. -Well, your costume's terrible. -What, you can't--? -You can't-- No? You're dead as well, aren't you? Brilliant. Curse was born with me death. Should've just paid that damn bill. Yeah, you should've. So will your mate do us the honor of breaking the curse? Kirk: Well, he'd like to. It's just, we don't have the money required. We could use the treasure to pay the debt. It's cursed. Not all of it. Are you sure you picked us a strong and sturdy boat? Aye, Captain. The strongest they had. I want the cheapest boat you got. You are the worst boat maker that I've ever hired! I will never be able to sell that crap! I have just the boat for you. [wood creaks and splinters] [water rushes in boat] He said he lost 600 pounds of gold bars at the bottom of the Great Sea! Treasure untouched by the curse? He says he'll show us where it is! Oh, there you are! Did you find it? [panting] Flint: Alright, listen. I know how to break the curse. Mrs. Redgrave: Where's the treasure? Flint: It's back there. No, no. Wait, wait. Mrs. Redgrave: Hold on, I have to see it. Flint: No, I-- Okay, don't touch anything. Remember the treasure's cursed. -Exactly. -[cocks pistol] While you're here, how you doing? Flint: Good-- Oh! [panting] Pirate! You didn't think I knew it was you, did you? Because I pretended I didn't know it was you. You wanna know why? You wanna know why? Well, you probably don't know this about me, but I'm a good pretender. Oh! [gasps] Be still, my heart. -Don't touch my treasure! -Mom! Okay, here's the plan. You'll go take the treasure, I'll watch you die, I'll see how the curse works and figure out how to break it. Does that sound good? [screams] Damn. Well, I missed it. Your goods, or your life. -[sword slices flesh] -[Drake groans] Kirk: Oh, Flint! [laughs excitedly] You with the sword and the... [growls excitedly]! And sneaking up so sneaky! Ah, that was incredible! You make me so proud. -I'm gonna vomit. -Uh-oh. Kirk! Oh, why on Earth are you still dressed in that ridiculous outfit? Mother, I'm a pirate. Ah, well, we'll see what Saint Peter has to say about that. Guaranteed, you won't get into Heaven the way you look. Mother, we're not going anywhere. Look around, we're cursed. Let's see what we can do about that curse. -Kirk: Right behind you, sir. -Wait! Okay, very good plan. I'll stay here, hold down the fort. [thud] Well how long is this gonna take? Couldn't he stop to eat after we've broken the curse? Why don't you practice patience? After over 200 years, what's 20 more minutes? Sorry. [sighs] Ahoy, me precious. Come here, I got something I want to show you. I don't think I should. You're coming with me, whether you like it or not. Now you're speaking my language! Nice wheels. This is awkward. [groaning] -Suspect spotted! -[radio static] Suspect spotted! Headed west! [cell phone beeps] [tires screech] Ruby: Where are you taking me? Flint: You'll see. Does the lad know where he's going? [grunts] [breathing heavily] I killed a man today, so. Oh! What is it? -Nothing, I... -Kirk: My fault. Terrible timing. Thought I saw a shark right over there... I scared him away. -There's no fish in Salt Lake. -No, I know, it's just-- That's nice. Good! Now that you got that out of the way, I just wanted to let you know, row that direction. Aye. Sir! Stop right there! I'm Detective Anderson on official police business. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to commandeer that vehicle. Hold it right there. Stay right there now. I don't want to have to fire a shot across your bow. Thank you very much. Watch the shoes, I'd appreciate it. You'll get tickets to the police ball if you do it. Can you give me a push? Another 50 to 100 yards and we're there, about ten feet under water. ...40, 41, 42... You ever gonna tell me what we're doing here? When I'm ready, lass. ...45, 46, 47... Odd. This lake used to be wider. Well, the sea level has dropped in this area in recent years. Are you sure nobody's found it? A pirate knows when his treasure's been touched by foreign hands. -Flint: Oof! -[Ruby laughs] You ever go looking for something that wasn't really all that lost to begin with? I'd say most of us spend most of our lives looking for that which was right there all along. [beeping] Tragedy of it all is that we dig and we dig and we dig so desperately to find whatever it is we're looking for. Until, of course, we get tired of digging there and start digging somewhere new. When, if we'd endured, if we'd just shoveled away one more pile... Ruby: Holy shit! ...we'd have struck gold. Ruby: Did you just hit a coffin? Flint: I don't know, I don't know. Did you steal all of this? As a matter of fact, I did. You could say that. [grunts] What? What are you doing? I've got to show this gold to a mapmaker that lives on the North Shore to pay a debt. What? Are you crazy? Do you know how much this is worth? We should keep this for ourselves and skip town. No. No, lass. We would never have to work again! You don't understand! I have to use this gold to break a curse so that my dead friend and captain can rest in peace. Why didn't you say so? [thud] Argh, the curse has long arms. [thunk] -[cocks pistol] -[thud] Drop the weapon, ma'am. I was just-- You was just beating to death your pirate boyfriend. I know. I saw. Turn around. -Where's Lynn Redgrave, kid? -[Flint groans] -Flint: She's dead. -Anderson: Blast it! Why did you have to kill her? He told me why. I'll testify if you let me go. Tell me, where did you put the body? Was the pawn shop owner in on it with you? No, him I did kill. Bad move. Left hand, here. Now the other hand. -You asked for it. -[groans] Oh no, you didn't! I'll get you! You are fat! Never thought you'd turn out to be a lowly backstabber. [groaning] [vultures screech] [panting] I'm lost. Can't find the road. Should've brought my cell phone. I don't have a cell phone. I should get a cell phone when I-- ...get back! Oh, hello! Oh my. Where in the world? [screams in excitement] I'm rich! One curse is now broken. Only one? Oh. Again you help my family. I'm sorry I arrived late. He will pay for this. A pirate treasure he wants... [spits] ...a pitiful pirate he will be! [chuckles] Well no, I didn't get the damn treasure! It's cursed. Yeah. [groans] Well, at least if I can't have it, no one else will. I gotta go. How much will you give me for that? [groans] Goodbye, old friend. May you rest in peace. Would you take off that stupid hat? You look ridiculous! Welcome, Catherine Redgrave. The pearly gates are that way. [jingling bells] [gasps] Oh, I'm sorry you can't come with me. I tried to tell you. I know, Mother. Heaven is no place for pirates. -Exactly right. -[jingling bells] That's why we have Pirate Heaven. Pirate Heaven? There's a Pirate Heaven? Second star on the right, straight on till morning! No, that way. To the left. Boy, you better remember to visit me. It's the pirate code. [bell dings] ♪ [upbeat music] ♪
