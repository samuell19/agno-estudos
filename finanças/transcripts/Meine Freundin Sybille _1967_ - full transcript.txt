My name is Hurtig, Hurtig, Hurtig. - At the last moment. And he calls himself a guide. Hurtig is my name, my dear women. - I'm asking- carefully follow the luggage or a moment- and it can be gone. - Have you lost something dear guide? The list of passengers? - It can't be! - My maid's. I must have the list here. - Haven't you forgotten anything, my dear? - My pet, we packed everything together. - Wait! Here it is. I knew, it was there. - Well, help him, for heaven's sake! - Count upon me, and everything's going tol be alright. - Mister Meier, beautiful girls still exist! - Oh, yes! But they are not meant for doctor Meier. - Come on, we must go. - Returning from holidays? - Everybody follow me, and everything's going to be alright. My dear collegue surgeon, of course, you don't encounter any problems in your work. You diagnose appendicitis - and you remove it. In our occupation of psychiatrists, everything is much more complicated. We need to take every instance individually. and speaking about our guide... - People say, he speaks seven languages! - What a man! Seven languages? - Lampa - means a lamp. A lamp. It's a lamp! - Is this the first time, you are flying abroad? - No. - But first time for me. And you? - For me too. - Coffee or a tea? Would you like coffee or tea? - ...yes. - My name is Ronny. Ronny Sommer. - And my name is Sybille. - Very well... - And there sits my parents. My father is a professor. - Listen, i have a feeling, that we have already met before. Of course, i can be wrong. - It's justifiable that people forget. - All in all, you can understand, what difficulties psychiatrists are facing in their work. Comrade guide! - That's lampa... Comrade guide! - Yes. - Where are we now precisely? - I have no idea... - He has no idea! What guide are you! I feel that we are going to spend a number of "wonderful" days together. - What did you say, my dear colleague guide? - I told that we are in an open sea, and you still haven't put your tourists in their cabins. - But it's not so easy with the newlyweds Hoffmanns. They are listed as mister Hoffmann and Fr?ulein Zabel on my list. But they decided and got married yesterday. - And they can prove that? - Their passports still doesn't have any record about the marriage, and they have forgotten their marriage license at home. - And naturally, now, a double cabin for them must be found! - I guess, the list can simply be corrected. I can swap two single cabins for one double cabin designed for married ones. - But this list is an official document! - Alright, then let's just give them a double cabin. - But we are married, seriously! It's our honeymoon trip! - Just look at them! - I can prove we are married. - But if you cannot prove this fact with any documents, then you are neither married, nor wedded, and must be separated! - Count upon me, and everything's going to be alright. - You need to go to the radioman and get a proof from your marriage bureau. Naturally, it will take a couple of days, so until then... - And you comrade Hurtig, Hurtig! - Hurtig, Hurtig. please take your luggage and follow me. - Let's go. - Leave them to me. - May i? - Yes, please. - Come, my child! - I'm not a child! - I will give you separate rooms later. - How's that? I will explain later. - Count upon me, and everything's going to be alright. Cabin number 207. Husband and wife Matti. Director and director's wife. - W. H. G. A. - W. H. G. A. - Winner of Heinrich Graf's award. 208. - Doctor Macke? - Doctor M?cke! - Missis doctor M?cke, and fr?ulein Rubenzahl! - Siebenzahl, comrade guide. - Yes, yes, Siebenzahl. - He doesn't even know how to read! - But i wanted to be in a cabin with fr?ulein F?lve.. - Yes, exactly. Come with me fr?ulein Siebenzahl. - What? It cannot be... Oh, yes, yes, you are right! - Elisabeth! - Then missis doctor M?cke, in the other cabin? - Yes, exactly as it was ordered. - Well please. Please, let's move along. - Maybe you will stay in this cabin? It's a very nice cabin. - Oh yes! - And the whole cabin just for us. Not bad, eh? While in my cabin there are four men. - So, how is it? - Do we unpack our bags, or play a game of cards first? - The bags won't run away. - I have no idea how to play cards. - Where's that Ronny? - And exactly: a very and very nice cabin. Wait, i will help you. - Excuse me, i got lost. The ship is so big! - What is the number of your cabin? - I don't know. Maybe you can help me find it? - Yes, of course. Excuse me. - Until later, Helena. - Fr?ulein Zabel. - But i'm missis Hoffmann already! - But here it is not written, that you are Hoffmann. And fr?ulein Sybille Remus! - You still don't have any cabin. - I didn't say that i have. I only said, that the ship is huge. - You are living right here. - Come in, my child. - I'm not a child! - Comrade guide! Where are we now precisely? - I cannot tell accurately. - Naturally! - Naturally? - But you have to know it! Your're a guide. You will find this information at the captain's bridge, in the morning, noon and evening. - Listening, dear colleague chief guide. - An ordinary guide. - An ordinary guide.... Ordinary guide.? - Nonsense! I just wanted to tell that, you really surprise me. - No? no. - And honestly speaking, you were recommended to me as a great organiser. And that you have already travelled by seas... - And by air! - And on earth! And that you are a great guide and speak seven languages! - You are mistaken here, my colleague chief senior guide. I'm only a substitute for him. - Who are you? - I only fill in for my friend Hubert. But i'm doing my best. If some little mistake appears here and there... - A little mistake here and there!? You were making nothing else, but mistakes during first 3 days of our trip. You are sabotaging our communal early morning exercises! - Only because my tourists prefer to stay in bed longer. - You have organised no swimming, no table tennis and no chess tournament. - Do i have to? - If you had read a manual for guides, you would have known. Tell me, have you given any thought at all about our big sporting festival? Of course, not! And what participation can we expect from your group? Then think of something by yourselves! Do you know how to yodel? - Of course i do, and how! These two dames are looking for a partner, so that they can sing as a trio. "Song about love." - I need to organise for you: a table tennis, chess and swimming. Would you like to participate? Excuse me. I understand. - I need to learn how to sing. - Yeah, when one wants to attract attention ... - Singing - is everything. - I have to say, she's started hunting at once. - Maybe, we should buy bikinis too? - I don't know how to roll sixes. - What a nonsense! You cannot roll six eyes? So, let's roll sixes. And roll six. Here! And now look carefully: so, so and so. And so, and so, and so. Only sixes. - Zina, listen, how do you like this: in her face the whole human hapiness is mirrored. - You have gone crazy, my dear. - One more vodka, please! - Regrettable. We don't have any luck to be left alone. - Yes. - Don't be such an egoist. - Yes, don't forget about the collective! - More vodka, please! - Cheers! - Cheers! - What did you see there? - An interesting fellow. - Maybe we should invite him to movie business, what do you think? - Doesn't sound tempting, my dear. - Damn, this place is taken as well. - The rescue boat is empty! - Great, let's go! - One more vodka, please! - Thank you! Doctor, and you? - It seems, that i will question. - Two champagnes! - Coming! - Is it true, that champagne gives you wings? - It's possible! - Give me one more vodka! - Cheers! - Cheers! - You can just leave the bottle here. - Listen, you better better tell your parents or a guide. - No, no, nothing is right. We should sing in unison. And so, let's try it one more time, together. Two, three. I can't. I better roll the dice. - Your boss informed us, that you will sing and yodel with us. - Well, if the senior chief guide said so! Yes, the senior chief guide can only tell the truth, my dear ladies. Let's start again. Three, four. - Comrade guide, can you tell me how to find the bar? - No - i - cannot- tell. You are looking for a bar? For a bar? I will help you find it at once. Please sing a bit in stead of me, thank you. - Two, three, and! - It's enough for you, litttle one. - I'm not a child. - It's water! - You can party even without alcohol. Then i wish you to drink further. Ladies waltz! Three cognacs. - Can i? - The bar isn't here. - I see it myself. I understand only three words in german. - That's . - Hush, little child. - If you say so. - This is where the bar is! But where is missis doctor M?cke? - Have a guess. - Remained on the captain's bridge? - No! - In the swimming pool? - In the refrigerator! And there you can see Batumi! - No, it's Radebeul over the river Elbe. - Radebeul? - Correct! According to the longitude and latitude which i've shown you, it must be Radebeul. - No need to shout so loudly, it doesn't look like Radebeul at all. - There must be a nice scenery over there. I should try to film over there. What do you think? - Sounds tempting. - Did you sleep well, my child? - Yes, but i'm not a child. - Yes, i know, i know. - Come on, i've already told you, she's not a child anymore. - It's so nice and there are mountains over there! - Oh, yes. - And where is our Hoffmann couple? - Good question, i haven't seen them as well. - My little mice! Look, it's morning already! - Let's just stay here for the whole day then. - Agreed! - Please line in pairs! Please line in pairs! And stand still near the ship. - Look how beautiful it is here, my Elisabeth! - You are right, exactly, like at home. - Good day? and here i am. If i'm bothering you, i will leave at once. - You can stay. - Aren't you glad, that i'm staying here? - Ok, ok. But don't expect that i will try flirting with you. It's too hot today for such matters. And besides that, you are too young. - I'm seventeen already! - I know. - Then why are you treating me like i was fourteen. - Because... ... You like Helena more. - Well, that's completely different. Sybille, i'm not seventeen anymore. - So? - There are some things... - Like what? - Don't look like you don't understand, where the river is running. That's why people go on such trips, understand now? And now you will stand up and. - Don't laugh at me. - I know, what i'm talking about. - You are not the type, that just... And besides that, i have no intention to flee at the end of the adventure and spin tales, that i'm going to write you. Maybe, that's what i'm going to do on Christmas and if i'm happen to be in your town, i will visit you as a guest. Then your mother will bake a cake with raisins, and your father will show me his postage stamps collection. - You are a moron! He has a collection of nails. - Alright, then he will show me his nails. Then we will go for a stroll together, kiss for a while, and then once again, a big pause. But i don't think that the winds will bring me to your town in any near future. Sybille, are you crying now? - Certainly not. - You are a child! - Leave me alone, you, moron! - Oh, well... I thought that she loved me. - What happened? - Nothing. - Oh, that's what it is... Hurtig, you need to think up something. - I guess we are the only passengers on the deck. All the others are already asleep. I cannot hear anyone in the whole universe. Is there a fan in your cabin? Yes, but it doesn't work. - What? And you haven't told me about this before? I will fix it right now. Come with me, Helena. I imagined your cabin to be a little bit different. But the beauty of it's inhabitant changes everything. Oh? yes... Let's see. Now i will fix everything. - It already happened. - Short circuit. - Maybe it happened outside? - We won't fix it outside. We better just wait. Let's sit down. Fate gave me this unexpected present, dear Helena. - Yes. Let's love each other. - Only not on my bed, mister Sommer! - Yours? - Yes, your lady sleeps over there! - But she had a double cabin! - Our guide gave that cabin to Hoffmanns. - What now, got busted? - Shut up! Following after me from the beginning of this cruise. - I keep following you? As if i needed you! - Yes, you, i see that you are even jealous of me. - Me jealous!? Who do you think you are!? You thought you played a guitar well! - And do you know, who you are? A foolish wench. - My dear, what was it? - A storm! Don't be afraid, my little mice. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for Hurtig- we agreed to meet here. - Me too. - On what business? - It doesn't concern you. - In fact, i don't give a damn, you know. - We almost got lost without you. - Oh, it would have made me very sad! - You can keep your ironic remarks to yourself in the future. Because if we were left here, YOU would have been responsible for that. - Please, missis doctor! - Hurtig, do you know where the watches are? - What watches? - Timers! - Yes, i know. - If you do know, then why did you tell the tourists to turn their watches one hour back? - That's what was written in the manual for guides. - Yes, but that only applies to when we go south! - So i was right, you see. - But we weren't going south! Here Moscow time applies. - Got it? - Got it. - Ah, i got it: watches must be turned according to timer of our ship. - And remember: everything written on any ship is according to Moscow time. - Got it? - Got it. You know, i'm very happy, that everyone returned to ship on time. - Exactly! Yes! True! And the same punctuality is expected always. - Of course, chief guide! Ouch, Ronny! And Sybille? What an idea came over me. Stop! Stop! Ronny, Sybille, i'm coming, everything's going to be alright. - What are we going to do now... Let's wait a little longer. - Wait for what? - Somebody must take us. - "Us"? How come? - What i meant, was how are we going to travel further. Without ship and everything. I know. We are simply going to tell about us to the police. - Why are you keep saying "we" and "us"? - Because "We" need to get back to the ship. - In fact, "You" need to get back to the ship, and "I" need to get back to the ship. Go to your police, while i will go to the next port. Anyone will take me with them, and i can even pick up any auto marque, that i want. - Are you crazy? Don't you understand: the next port is Sukhumi, and it's hundread miles away from here. - It's "My" problem. - Can you tell me, why you are following me? - I'm sorry, i just wanted to take a look at the sign. - Please. - Thank you. - Excuse me, are you sure, that the ship stops at Sukhumi. - Yes. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - What should i do now? I should go to the police. With all these passports, i might be mistaken for some foreign agent. What's more, i need to find those... Ronny and Sybille. - Just what i needed! - Excuse me, can you lend me one ruble, i left all of my money in the ship. Thank you! - I need to get to Sukhumi. - Very nice of you, dear colleague, but i need to go very far. - Please. Please please. - He understands german! - No cars, nothing in sight. - While on the ship they are having macaroni right now. Yes, yes, i wouldn't refuse a plate of macaroni myself. Man has to eat something, you know. - Do you have any money left? - 27 rubles. - That's great! In... the... ship. - I have to get out now, and pick up some car passing by, that would take me to Sukhumi. - He will take you as well! - And a case of beer? No, i cannot take it. Rabbit! A rabbit. How nice, and just what i call a souvenir! - Wait! Take me with you! Everything will be alright. - Anything happens sometimes. I was a passenger and my ship left me. I boarded the ship in Murmansk and got out in Astrakhan. Understand me? What a trip it was! Took me 4 months. I have a wife, i'm a vice director of the fishing company. - We need to go back. - WE? - If every vice director looked like a marine officer, i would love to be a vice director of a tea kolkhoz. Just go to the next station and then take a train. There's still a lot of time. We will visit my sister who's getting married. It will be fantastish. - Don't get stuffed. - We need to go further to catch the ship. - Now? When it's so nice here? - You don't look like a director of a fishing company at all. If you are not coming with me - i will go alone. - You need to get off here- Sukhumi is much further. Good bye! - Gone somewhere. - Gigolo! We'll see how you'll manage to get on the boat without me. - Ah, here you are! - Ah, here you are! - I wonder who's running after whom? - You were running so fast, that... - People were so nice. - Yes, i saw! - They could have driven us to the train station. - But we don't have money for the tickets. - They would have bought us tickets as a present. - I managed to come here even without them. - Me too. - Ok, ok. - Friends? - Friends! - Now everything will be ruined. - You were so convinced that the ship will be stopping at Sukhumi. - Our guide told us so. - And now we are lost again. - There's nothing else to do, than go further- to Sochi. - And what if our ship won't stop there either? - It will stop, i can assure you. - Ah, if i have been alone and followed ! - I thought you are , because now you are with me. - My ship, it's my ship! My ship, and it's here! I caught up with it! Regards to your wife! I need to board the ship. I understood, everything's going to be alright. - And here i am, excuse me, my dear colleague, senior chief guide. - Ah, you understand me? I'm a guide for the tourist group from France. - I happened to catch the wrong ship. - Sybille, where do this taxi driver take us? - He wants to show us the mountains! - Hold on, hold on, ladies and gentelmen, we are almost here. my friends, i will be your guide. - Don't stand here, get in. - But i don't want to. We are talking about a communal excursion here, so everyone must take part in it. - And where are we going? And where is it? - I have no idea. - Great guide you are. - Dear colleague, please, get in at last. Sorry, what's your name? I forgot it. So, get in, get in, faster, faster. Going directly to Sochi. - Sochi!? - You could leave your bags in a hotel. - Someone's missing? - But no, we have one too many. I don't understand. - You know, i'm filling in for a colleague, who's a very capable guide. - And where are we now, comrade guide? - If i had known! - But you have to know, you are our guide. - Oh, please drop these questions of yours, my dear lady. Even if he graduated an institute, he's just a man after all, and you are asking him such questions. It's not very pleasent, my dear lady. - I thank you, dear colleague. It's just what i wanted to say. - Me too. - Sybille, did you tell him, that we don't have any money? - Naturally! You should have studied russian language harder when you were in school. I understand this language perfectly. - We need to go further, my child. - Just a little bit longer. He's so nice! And besides that, - I know: we don't have money. You don't have to show it, it's obvious how it is. What the comrade will think of you. - He's jealous! - You could at least say good bye. - You did that - one couldn't think anything better than that. - It's just a german- russian friendship. - They are going to the north direction. - Then let's go with them! - 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 21, 22. Funny, now we have two extra passengers. While the one with his bags got lost somewhere, or... - Thirst is worse than a longing for home. And there's so much water. Dog, what do you want? Dog, go find your master. Dog, i'm not your master. And i don't have anything delicious that i can give you. Go, run away. I won't look back and he will go away. You are a fine dog. Thank you very much. Train stops here? Dog, you broke my heart, but, please, excuse me. I must go. - What a fool our guide is! - Maybe we didn't understand him correctly? Maybe they didn't gather in Gagra. - I haven't thought, that we will appear in this place. - And how much have we strayed from our course? - 50- 60 kilometers at minimum. We need to get back to the sea. - Maybe we can have a swim here. - Damn, i don't have the trunks with me. - I don't have anything either. - How unfortunate... - If only i had known... - I can't believe my eyes. You, again? To travel together... You knew, that i had no ticket. Dog, you did a fine thing, bravo. - It's great out here, isn't it? - Yes, but we must turn back and go further. - Oh, my God. - We'll have to get out of the water, no matter what. - A little mistake happened, dear comrades! I'm not a young eagle eager to see the mountains. You got me wrong. Above and below i was speaking about ship and not the horse. And where are you going after all? - Who was this ? It cannot be him. - Are you sure, that we need to climb there? We have to, we will return on our way after topping that mountain. - But there's a construction site over there! - If there's a construction site, there must be people too. - There will be a dam here. You can't see it at the moment, but it will appear soon. The river will be turned through another watercourse, there will be a tunnel in the mountain and a new road will be built. - What height the dam will have? - 270 meters. Up until there. - Will there be a lot of water through? - Oh, yes. Half milliard of cubic liters. Hydro electric station will be capable of producing 2 million kilowats per hour. - I cannot believe it. - You'll see, if you come back in a few years time, there will be a huge lake here, with a width of 25 kilometer. - Oh! I would love to swim in it! - At first, we need to get back to our ship. - We will catch your ship in Sochi. I will bring you to our barracks now. It will get dark soon. You will find where to sleep in our daddy Serafim's house. - Dog, what are we going to do next? Go forward or return back? There's a construction site over there! Where something is being built- people must be around. Where people is- therein... Dog, let's go. - One bed is better than no bed at all! - Come! Let's go for a walk! The weather is perfect for a stroll! - Stop sabotaging russian hospitality. We will make these wonderful people sad if we run away. Stay here, or we will get lost again. Dad Serafim will drive us to Sochi tomorrow. - Well yes, but... what are you planning to do now? - To go to bed, it's late already. - Yes, but... - Are you going to stand there all night? - No. - And what are you doing now? - What are you doing there? - I'm sleeping. - It's not possible to sleep like that... - It is, it is. - Don't be funny, come here. Or are you afraid? Are you sleeping already? - Yes. - Ronny? - I bet you felt happier if you slept with Helena. - No. Sleep at last. - What if i can't? - Imagine a thousand sheep, that are jumping. - All together? - No. One by one. - Yeah. - And now count. - One. - Don't stop. - One. - Count. There are many sheep. - But i see only one. - Excuse me, please, for a little disturbance... - Yeah, yeah. I hope that our ship is already waiting in Sochi. Hope we won't miss our ship. It must be here, it stays in the pier for a long time. How do you call that... How do you call "a pier" in russian? - I would like to give you something as a present. - Interesting, interesting. Pity, but i don't have anything else to give. - Yes, and many of them. - I think they are all still sleeping. - That's good. - Good morning. - Hello. - Don't move! Finally, caught up with you. - Oh, my colleague senior guide. My thousand appologies. - Appologies not accepted, you are going to yodel now. - You won't believe me, but i returned just for that. I want to yodel so badly. - Where did you lose our ship? - In Bathumi. - Do you think, i'm so drunk, that you can tell me fairytales? - But i really was left there. Then i traveled through the mountains, through prairies! - Hurtig, why are you such a liar!? We are going to yodel now. - Yodel? - Yes, yodel. Ladies are already waiting. - Kids, why are you showing up so lately!? - You've already missed the best part of this party. - They haven't even noticed, that we were missing. - And here we are! Ladies and gentlemen! Hush?hush?hush! And now, the best part of our celebration! The yodel singers trio! - Please hold in pairs and don't leave our group. - Fr?ulein Wolf, Fr?ulein Herbert, Mister and missis Matz. - I'm not surprised! - Fr?ulein Fulve, Fr?ulein Siebenzahl, - What a trip it was! - Mister Remus, - Present. missis Remus, Sybille, doctor Macke, - M?cke.

Mister Hoffmann, fr?ulein Zabel, sorry, i mean missis Hoffmann. german tourist group, please go to the bus, plane from Odessa is leaving at 13 o'clock. - Come out! - Come out! - Are we in Bathumi already? - No, we are already in Odessa! - Just like that! Leave it alone, Alfreda. - Doctor Meier ... - Yep, Meier... - Zina, what would you think about this: he looks into her eyes and whispers- i love you. - Just divine, my dear. - Oh dear! What a wonderful honeymoon trip! - And when i'm in your town... - You will come to us for a visit. ...and mother will bake a big cake with raisins, and father will show his collection of stamps. - My child, i collect nails. - Where are we now, comrade guide? - Near our home, missis doctor. - Finally? you are on the right path. Central airport of Berlin. - So long! So long, mister professor. So long! Sybille! - Yes? - What i wanted to say... if you don't have anything against it, i will come next Sunday for a cake with raisins. - Believe me, everything's going to be alright. - Hey, it's good that i finally caught up with you! - What is it, have i forgotten to pay? - No, no, i will give back your change. - But i need a lift home. - Alright, i will drive you home. - Do you see a dog? - What dog? Ah, yeah, there it is. - With wings, yes? - With wings? - No, no. - There's no use. Thank you.
