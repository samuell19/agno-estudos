In the Name of Allah the Merciful the Beneficent Al-Furqan for Media Production Exclusive coverage of the Friday khutbah and prayer in the Grand Masjid of Mosul 6 Ramadan 1435 As-salamu 'alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh Al-Khalifah Ibrahim Amir Al-Mu'minin of the Islamic State (hafidhahullah) Truly all praise belongs to Allah. We praise Him and seek His help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allah from the evils of our souls and from the consequences of our deeds. Whomever Allah guides can never be led astray, and whomever Allah leads astray can never be guided. I testify that there is no god except Allah – alone without any partners, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. May Allah Ta'ala send much blessings and peace upon him, his family and companions. {O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims} [Al ‘Imran: 102]. {O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice. He will amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His messenger has certainly achieved a great triumph} [Al-Ahzab: 70-71]. As to what follows; the most truthful of speech is the Book of Allah. The best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallAllahu 'alayhi wa sallam). The worst of evils are newly invented matters [in religion]. Every newly invented matter is a bid'ah. Every bid'ah is deviance. Every deviance leads to Hellfire. {O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous - [Fasting for] a limited number of days} [Al-Baqarah: 183-184]. Allah Ta'ala also said, {The month of Ramadan [is that] in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it} [Al-Baqarah: 185]. O Muslims, reaching Ramadan is a great blessing, a great bounty from Allah Ta'ala. It is a month whose beginning is mercy, its middle is forgiveness, and its end is emancipation from Hellfire. It is a month if one fasts faithfully, anticipating reward, all his previous sin is forgiven. And if he spends its night in prayer faithfully, anticipating reward, all his previous sin is forgiven. Abu Hurayrah (radiAllah 'anh) said, that Allah's Messenger (sallAllahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, "Whoever fasts Ramadan faithfully, anticipating reward, all his previous sin is forgiven." "And whoever spends Ramadan's nights praying, faithfully, anticipating reward, all his previous sin is forgiven." When this month arrives, the gates of Jannah are opened. The gates of Hellfire are closed; the devils are chained. It is a month with a night better than a thousand months. Whoever is prevented from it, is prevented from all good. {Laylatul-Qadr is better than a thousand months. The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn} [Al-Qadr: 3-5]. It is a month in which every night Allah frees some slaves from Hellfire. It is a month in which the market of Jihad is established. Therefore, the Prophet (sallAllahu 'alayhi wa sallam) would prepare brigades and armies to fight the enemies of Allah and perform jihad against the mushrikin. So seize the opportunity in this noble month, O slaves of Allah, by obeying Allah. For in this month, reward is multiplied. {So for this let the competitors compete} [Al-Mutaffifin: 26]. O Muslims, indeed Allah Tabaraka wa Ta'ala created us to practice tawhid, worship Him, and establish His religion. He Ta'ala said, {And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me} [Adh-Dhariyat: 56]. And He Tabaraka wa Ta'ala ordered us to fight His enemies and perform jihad fi sabilillah to actualize this [tawhid] and establish the religion. He Ta'ala said, {Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you} [Al-Baqarah: 216]. He Ta'ala also said, {And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah} [Al-Anfal: 39]. O people, indeed the religion of Allah Tabaraka wa Ta'ala is not established nor is this goal, which Allah created us for, achieved except by ruling by Allah's law, referring to it for judgment, and implementing the hudud. This is not achievable except with power and authority. Allah Ta'ala said, {We have sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice. And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people, and so that Allah may make evident those who support Him and His messengers unseen. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might} [Al-Hadid: 25]. So this is the basis of the religion, a book that guides, and a sword that aids. Indeed your brothers the mujahidin, were blessed with victory by Allah Tabaraka wa Ta'ala and were blessed with consolidation after long years of jihad, patience, and fighting the enemies of Allah. Allah guided them and strengthened them to establish this goal. Therefore they rushed to announce the Khilafah and appoint an Imam. This is an obligation upon the Muslims - an obligation which was abandoned for centuries, and disappeared off the face of the Earth. So many Muslims were ignorant of it and are sinful for abandoning it. It is always obligatory upon them to establish it. So now they have established it, to Allah is all praise and from Him are all blessings. I was burdened with this great matter. I was burdened with this trust, this heavy trust. I was appointed as a leader for you, although I am not the best of you, nor am I better than you. Therefore, if you see me upon truth, then aid me. And if you see me upon falsehood, then advise me. Obey me as long as I obey Allah in your regards. And if I disobey Him, then I have no authority over you in such. I will not promise you as the kings and rulers promise their followers and subjects with luxury, comfort, security, and leisure. Rather I promise you with what Allah Tabaraka wa Ta'ala promised His believing slaves. {Allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to authority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them and that He will surely establish for them [therein] their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security, [for] they worship Me, not associating anything with Me. But whoever disbelieves after that - then those are the defiantly disobedient} [An-Nur: 55]. He Ta'ala also said, {So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers} [Al 'Imran: 139]. He Ta'ala also said, {If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you} [Al 'Imran: 160]. He Ta'ala also said, {and incumbent upon Us was support of the believers} [Ar-Rum: 47]. He Ta'ala also said, {And to Allah belongs [all] honor, and to His Messenger, and to the believers, but the hypocrites do not know} [Al-Munafiqun: 8]. This is the promise of Allah. So if you want the promise of Allah, then fear Allah and obey Him. Obey Allah Al-'Azim in every matter and in every condition. Adhere to the truth and hold on to it in matters you like and dislike. If you want Allah's promise, then perform jihad fi sabilillah, incite the believes, and be patient upon this hardship. If you knew what was in jihad of reward, honor, loftiness, and might, in the Dunya and Akhirah, none of you would sit back or remain behind, abandoning jihad. It is the trade that Allah guided to. He saved the people from humiliation by it. And He attached honor to it in the Dunya and Akhirah. {[It is that] you believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if you should know. He will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence. That is the great triumph. And [you will obtain] another [favor] that you love - victory from Allah and an imminent conquest; and give good tidings to the believers} [As-Saff: 11-13]. I end here, and I seek forgiveness from Allah for me and you. Supplicate Allah while you are certain of His response. All praise is truly to Allah. May blessings and peace be upon the Prophet whom there is no prophet after, and upon his family, companions, party, soldiers, and those who righteously follow him until the Day of Meeting and Recompense. There is no god except Allah - alone without any partner. He fulfilled His promise, aided His soldiers, and defeated the parties alone. There is no god except Allah - alone without any partner. We sincerely submit to Him with our religion even if the kuffar hate such. O slaves of Allah, establish your religion, and fear Allah as He should be feared. He will grant you honor in the Dunya and Akhirah. If you want security, then fear Allah. If you want provision, then fear Allah. If you want a noble life, then fear Allah and perform jihad fi sabilillah. We ask Allah Al-'Azim, the Lord of the Great Throne to unify your word, mend your relationships, and guide you to the best of what He loves and accepts. O Allah grant might to Islam and the Muslims, humiliate shirk and the mushrikin, and aid your slaves - the mujahidin muwahhidin from the east to the west of the Earth. O Allah, keep their feet firm, fill their hearts with bravery, and be a support and aid for them. O Allah, direct their shots, and correct their opinions. O Allah, prepare uprightness for them in their matters and make Your good support their aid. O Allah, changer of hearts, keep our hearts firm upon Your religion. O Allah, changer of hearts, turn out hearts towards obeying You. O Allah, purify our hearts from hypocrisy, our actions from riya', our tongues from lies, and our eyes from treachery. O Allah, we ask You for truthful faith, humble hearts, and accepted deeds. O Allah, we ask You for forgiveness, wellness, and constant health in the Dunya and Akhirah. O Allah make our gathering here one blessed with mercy, and make our parting thereafter blessed and sinless. O Allah, do not make any of us miserable and deprived. Our last call is that all praise is to Allah the Lord of the creation. May Allah's blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad. Make the iqamah. Allahu Akbar {Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, The Merciful, the Beneficent. Sovereign of the Day of Recompense. It is You we worship and You we ask for help. Guide us to the straight path - The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray} [Al-Fatihah] Amin. {And obey Allah and the Messenger that you may obtain mercy. And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous who spend [in the cause of Allah] during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people - and Allah loves the doers of good; And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah? and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know. Those - their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers} [Al 'Imran: 132-136].
