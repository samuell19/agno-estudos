Stop! Stop! ﻿Mostafa, come here! ﻿We agreed ﻿that he is supposed to talk. ﻿What do you want me to do? ﻿I told him to do so. - ﻿Where are the actors? ﻿- You told them not to come. Did I? ﻿That's what they told me. ﻿I went to look for them, one by one. ﻿I realized they haven't been paid. ﻿Where is ﻿Aïcha? ﻿We'll have to start from the beginning. - ﻿What do you think of me now? ﻿- Allah! Allah! - ﻿Did you shave your beard? ﻿- You asked me to. ﻿When we were filming you before... ﻿Okay, no big deal. ﻿Next time, you'll ask me to shave my head ﻿and you'll blame me for it. ﻿Or because I let my beard grow... ﻿And you'll ask me why! ﻿Even if you paid me... ﻿What do you care? ﻿It's theatre which makes you talk like this... ﻿- Aïcha, it's your fault. ﻿- What did I do? ﻿Come, Salah Eddine, ﻿come, my brother. - ﻿Okay. I should stand there, right? ﻿- Right. ﻿Okay, Yuness will be shooting later. ﻿They're all upset. ﻿No, no, no. It's the atmosphere. ﻿They need to calm down... - ﻿Mostafa! - Yes. ﻿I need your help. ﻿You know this place full well. - ﻿What's the name of that extra? ﻿- Abdellatif. Not in front of Salah Eddine. ﻿I want one next to Ibrahim, and the other... ﻿and all these people... ﻿Excuse me, do you have... - ﻿We need three microphones. - ﻿What? ﻿We need three microphones. ﻿Everything is okay with your questions, ﻿right, Mostafa? ﻿Put three here. - ﻿Three? - ﻿Yes. ﻿You and you, ﻿go that way, please. ﻿- Hamid, take him there! - ﻿Who? Abdellatif? ﻿Abdellatif! ﻿Abdellatif, ﻿come here right away. ﻿Are you Hamid or Abdellatif? ﻿Abdellatif, come here! - ﻿Mister Abdellah! ﻿- Three here... two down there. - ﻿What two? ﻿- Wait a minute. - ﻿Quiet... Quiet... ﻿Camera... - Rolling! ﻿It's 2 am! ﻿Are you sure that he'll come? ﻿Sure! Yesterday, I came at 3 o'clock ﻿and he was still there. ﻿He'll come... ﻿And he didn't pour my drink... ﻿That's it! Drinks are mixed up! ﻿Where's mine? Where's yours? ﻿You ate all the peanuts ﻿and I didn't complain. ﻿That's your drink, take it! ﻿Was he going to kiss you, Fatna? - ﻿No, that's my drink! ﻿- No, it's the other one! ﻿Let him swallow all this beer ﻿if he wants to. ﻿Look at him!﻿ He looks awful. - ﻿There's our friend... - ﻿Who? Our guy? ﻿He was provoking me. ﻿He followed me to the pinball game. ﻿He followed me to the jukebox... ﻿He followed me to the bathroom! ﻿Then he grabbed me by the shirt... ﻿Bless you, Mister Saïd! - ﻿We are honored by your visit. - ﻿Thank you, I'd like a... ﻿I'd like a soda. - ﻿﻿A soda? - Yes, a soda. - ﻿What? ﻿- A soda. - ﻿﻿Which one? - Judor. ﻿Do you really have the money? ﻿Are you making fun of me? ﻿No, I just came here for a drink. ﻿Then, I'll go. ﻿You should shave your... ﻿My beard? ﻿But I look good like this! ﻿I don't want to wax my shoes. ﻿No, I won't do it! ﻿That's fine. ﻿- They're going to sue the vulnerable! ﻿- Let them say whatever they want... ﻿I told you that there is so much... ﻿I wrote you down some of them... ﻿I don't want to wax them! ﻿Leave me alone. ﻿Waiter, clients... Everybody should get drunk in this cafe! ﻿Even the shoeshine-boy. ﻿Get him drunk and throw him out! ﻿Kick him out. - ﻿I was drunk once. ﻿- Where? In Casablanca? ﻿- No. - Where, then? - ﻿In Tangier. ﻿- Go away! You got drunk in the Strait! ﻿God bless your parents! ﻿Tell him! ﻿Give me some water. ﻿You don't give any tapas. No water, too. ﻿We give a glass of water ﻿with every glass of red wine. ﻿Give me the water! ﻿Can't you see my glass of red wine? ﻿Give me a glass of water! - ﻿There you have the bottle! ﻿- I don't want this water! ﻿I don't want it at all! ﻿I'm never coming back to this bar. ﻿Give me some water or it's over. ﻿You want me to say it in French? ﻿Can I have a glass of water, please? ﻿Please! ﻿Electricity or water... ﻿If you want to wax my shoes, ﻿you need to be more presentable. ﻿Do you smoke? ﻿Do you want to smoke? ﻿But I need a glass of water! ﻿﻿I want some water so I can mix it with my red wine. ﻿You want me to wax your shoes? ﻿My red wine, yes! ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Do you want me to wax your shoes, Sir? ﻿Do I have to speak to you ﻿in French too? ﻿Leave me alone... Leave me alone ﻿You see, they're provoking me... ﻿No! You shut up, beat it ﻿I don't want more beer, ﻿give me a soda. ﻿Give me a beer, I tell you! ﻿They're insane! ﻿I don't want to fight, I swear! ﻿- Give me a glass of water. ﻿- There you have it. Your water. ﻿This water is not clean. ﻿I don't want it! I don't want it! ﻿Give me a beer, please. ﻿I'm beginning to sober up. ﻿This bottle of water is hiding ﻿the microphone! - ﻿If I move it, you'll see it! ﻿- I have money, I do... - ﻿Give me some water. ﻿- I have money to pay. ﻿You have my coat, too. ﻿Keep it as a guarantee! ﻿He thinks he can curb me! ﻿I'll have my water anyway! I'll have some water before ﻿I drink more wine. ﻿Excuse me, we are doing ﻿some interviews about Moroccan cinema. ﻿Thank you for your question but... ﻿I think that cinema is... ﻿So, Moroccan cinema is... well, I like it... ﻿This is why I go to cinema ﻿to watch Moroccan films. ﻿Especially, the ones made ﻿by Abdelwahab Doukkali. ﻿I enjoyed them a lot. ﻿I live the adventure in a film. ﻿I care less about the social issues. ﻿- What's your job? - ﻿I'm a civil servant at the city hall. ﻿We have to interview older people, too. ﻿Not just kids... ﻿- They're just kids. ﻿- There's one. ﻿Excuse me, Sir. - ﻿May we interview you? ﻿- Yes, that's fine. ﻿We are asking questions about cinema. ﻿Do you go to the cinema? ﻿I work a lot and I don't have time ﻿to go to the cinema. ﻿The truth is ﻿I haven't seen any cinema yet. ﻿- You are talking about ﻿our national cinema. ﻿You have never seen a Moroccan film? ﻿- No, not yet. ﻿- What about foreign films? ﻿- Yes, I've seen some of them... ﻿Nevertheless, no Moroccan films. ﻿I have to admit it. We're still far behind. ﻿We are working in order to create ﻿a Moroccan cinema ﻿Instead of thinking about cinema, ﻿you should work on other things. ﻿What, for example? ﻿- Like the unemployed people. ﻿- We would talk about it on our films. - ﻿Call me when you are going ﻿to do your film. I'll answer you. - ﻿What's your name? ﻿- Ahmed Taoussi. ﻿What do you think about Moroccan cinema? ﻿We're doing a film. ﻿- What should it talk about? ﻿- Our problems, our social issues. ﻿Morocco is full of problems. ﻿There're no lucid films about it. ﻿Or maybe they're too intellectual ﻿for regular people. ﻿Or they say obvious things ﻿that everybody knows. ﻿But we don't have any films which force us ﻿to think about our problems. ﻿We're asking everybody what do they think ﻿about cinema in general, ﻿and Moroccan cinema ﻿in a more specific way. ﻿Moroccan cinema should be committed ﻿to the working class problems. ﻿This is not just a Moroccan issue, ﻿it concerns the whole Third World cinema. ﻿We can see that on films ﻿made by Latin American young filmmakers. ﻿I don't want Moroccan cinema ﻿to look like Egyptian cinema. ﻿Commercial cinema... ﻿Entertainment cinema... There is a term ﻿employed in the theatre... Intimism... ﻿Intimate cinema. ﻿I don't want this cinema neither ﻿I'd prefer a cinema ﻿which plays an important role ﻿in cultural education or ﻿raising awareness of regular spectators, ﻿so they can get used to ﻿a certain kind of cinema... ﻿Do you have another question? ﻿What would be the subjects ﻿that we should deal with? ﻿I think that you should talk ﻿especially about political issues... ﻿that are facing, as I said before, ﻿the working class masses, workers... ﻿Issues of the lumpenproletariat, ﻿the underclass. ﻿Cinema should talk about these people. ﻿Cinema should stop being too elitist. ﻿Cinema shouldn't be ﻿just for the bourgeois ﻿who go to the cinema in order to laugh ﻿and to see beautiful kiss scenes. ﻿The same who want to see a Cadillac ﻿or a beautiful house with a pool. ﻿I want a cinema which comes from ﻿the public and destined for the public. ﻿It's getting dark. ﻿Rafik! ﻿I think we can go. ﻿He's alone. ﻿May we ask you ﻿a couple of questions? ﻿Sure, why not? - ﻿We're asking questions about cinema. ﻿- Okay. ﻿- What do you do for a living? ﻿- I'm a school teacher. ﻿What do you think about cinema ﻿in general? What about Moroccan cinema? ﻿Cinema? I don't know... ﻿I don't know what to say ﻿about Moroccan cinema. - ﻿Do you go to the cinema often? - ﻿Yes, I do. - ﻿What kind of films do you like? - ﻿I don't really know... ﻿I'm embarrassed. I really don't know ﻿what to say about cinema. ﻿- We are a group ﻿of young Moroccan filmmakers. ﻿- What kind of films should we do? - ﻿I don't really know what to say. ﻿There are lots of things to say ﻿about cinema. ﻿- Could you possibly ﻿give us some examples? - ﻿I don't know... I think it's essential ﻿to do realistic scenes. ﻿That's all I have to say ﻿about subjects cinema should deal with... - ﻿Like what exactly? - ﻿I don't know what to say. ﻿- What are you doing about cinema? ﻿- We are interviewing some people... ﻿to know how to develop ﻿a national cinema. - ﻿We are the public. It's difficult ﻿for us to tell you what to do. ﻿What I can tell you is that we prefer ﻿a certain kind of films, though. ﻿At least, I do. ﻿There's a special kind ﻿which should be shown on Moroccan cinema, ﻿if there's a Moroccan cinema. Because until now, I can find ﻿only foreign films in Morocco. ﻿When you think about ﻿other Maghreb cinemas... ﻿Algerian cinema is interesting, ﻿for example. ﻿But we don't really have ﻿a Moroccan cinema ﻿which could compete ﻿with foreign cinemas. ﻿If there was one, it should talk about ﻿social issues concerning Moroccan people. ﻿If you take Westerns and films ﻿like “The Big Boss” for example, ﻿they are not really relevant ﻿to the Moroccan society. ﻿How could such a cinema be? ﻿We have had an artistic gap ﻿for the last three or four years... ﻿So, any Moroccan production ﻿could have an effect. ﻿For instance... ﻿- Excuse me for the interruption... ﻿- Sure. ﻿We are against the current system. ﻿We want a national cinema. ﻿Right, but I'm talking about ﻿a social and cultural issue. ﻿Give me a break, will you? ﻿Am I supposed to light ﻿your cigarettes every time? ﻿Go look for a lighter somewhere else! ﻿- He's too slow... - ﻿Calm down, will you? ﻿None of his partners came yet. ﻿You had the whole bottle. G﻿o away... ﻿Where are we going afterwards? ﻿Why? Did you plan something? ﻿No, I have another thing to do... - ﻿Are you afraid or what? ﻿- What do you mean? - Are you afraid of him? - Him? ﻿The trade unionist. - ﻿He's so stupid! ﻿- I'm just saying my opinion. ﻿Me, afraid? ﻿Aren't you afraid ﻿of that guy over there? ﻿I thought you were smart ﻿but you are just a moron! ﻿- Who was the guy you were talking to? ﻿- He works on the movie business. ﻿He asked me what kind of pictures ﻿they should make. I don't understand. ﻿I'll have a beer, please. ﻿Make it two. ﻿I was going to strand him. ﻿I was getting down the bus ﻿when I saw him with his gang. ﻿- Who was with him? ﻿- Omar and Muhammad, there they are. ﻿I saw them before. ﻿- You want a cigarette, right? ﻿- Sure. ﻿There you go. ﻿- Thank you very much. ﻿- Okay, beat it now. ﻿- Do you want me to stay? ﻿- Go grab a drink! We ll be joining you! ﻿Okay. ﻿What about the beers? - ﻿You want them fresh or warm? ﻿- This moron is laughing at my face. ﻿Warm or fresh, I ordered a beer! ﻿Give it to me! ﻿- Calm down, man. - He's provoking me! ﻿I've been waiting for half an hour, ﻿now he asks me if I want them warm! ﻿That's fine, case is closed... ﻿We went to see this guy last night ﻿to see what happens... ﻿We have been negotiating, ﻿I've taken the stock with me. - ﻿The whole stock? ﻿- Sure, everything he had. - ﻿I don't believe it. ﻿- You don't believe it? ﻿If I say I did, it means I did. ﻿How are we going to do to sell it? ﻿- How are we going to do it? ﻿- It's not going to be easy to sell it. ﻿Are you going to raise the prices or ﻿are you going to keep the same? - ﻿I don't know. ﻿What do you think we should do? - ﻿I think it's better ﻿if prices remain the same. ﻿You started shaking! ﻿What do you mean? I'm scared of you? ﻿- Where is my cigarette packet? ﻿- There it is. ﻿Calm down. ﻿Look at me. - ﻿﻿I don't think that's the right solution... ﻿If prices remain the same... ﻿we're going to sell them right. ﻿If we sell more, ﻿we'll have more buyers. ﻿- Sure, more sales. - ﻿Of course, more sales. ﻿﻿But if we have more sales, business will get more risky. ﻿- How are you going to beat him up ﻿if you're as drunk as him? - ﻿Don't be scared. ﻿- Go smoothly. - ﻿If we raise the price, ﻿we won't be bothered. ﻿This Black Death! ﻿What we lose in the sales volume will be ﻿reimbursed by the profit margin. ﻿Okay. ﻿Give me a beer, Stork. ﻿- Some red wine and another one ﻿with designation of origin. ﻿May your ancestry be cursed! - ﻿Give me my drink. ﻿- Leave him alone. - ﻿A coffee, please. ﻿- Yes, Sir. - Is the boss here? ﻿- Excuse me? - Is the boss here? ﻿- Yes, Sir. - ﻿We would like to film here. ﻿- Okay, Sir. ﻿Go look for the boss. Tell him ﻿people from the movies want to see him. ﻿Thank you very much. ﻿Leave it here. ﻿- We fell in the right place. ﻿- So many things to see, people to interview! ﻿I'm fine, thanks. ﻿- Move! ﻿- Stop it! ﻿Don't push me! ﻿Go fuck yourself! ﻿Drop the bottle! ﻿- Leave, go! ﻿- I'm leaving. ﻿- Where to? ﻿Anyone comes near you ﻿tell them to beat it. ﻿You pricks! ﻿Go away! ﻿Beat it! Spread out, gentlemen! ﻿You think you're tough, show me ﻿what you're going to do to me! ﻿Go away! ﻿He's your uncle ﻿but he doesn't want you to be fine. ﻿Nevertheless, ﻿he's your dad's brother. A ﻿wolf came out... ﻿and we went to Marrakesh. ﻿It was raining... ﻿I was wearing a cassock made of cotton ﻿and a burnoose. ﻿We were soaking wet ﻿and we came in a mosque. ﻿We'll give you some fish, Mister... ﻿I don't want to buy it! Freak! ﻿Calm down! ﻿You'll send it to somebody else! ﻿He kept his rifle, ﻿so the Qaid asked him for a bribe. ﻿He shot him. ﻿Give me a beer. ﻿That's beautiful. ﻿Leave it here! ﻿Saïd, where's my coffee? ﻿Since when are they here? ﻿They have arrived ﻿one after the other. ﻿A coffee, a glass of hot milk ﻿and a glass of wine. ﻿Make my coffee light, please. ﻿A coffee, a glass of wine ﻿and a glass of hot milk. ﻿He plays in the street. He came to me ﻿and he told me: Father... ﻿Give me a glass. ﻿You are drinking way too much. ﻿Calm down a little bit, will you? ﻿- Don't worry, I want to beat him up. ﻿- Sober up if you want to beat him. ﻿A chick just got in... ﻿She'll get him out for us. ﻿We care about our origins, ﻿not about what's old or new. ﻿Our world is ephemeral ﻿and time passes by. ﻿How are you, Miss? ﻿Are you looking for someone? - Yes, Karim. - ﻿Who? ﻿- Karim Tazi. - ﻿Who is Karim Tazi? Ah, right! ﻿- The journalist! - ﻿The journalist, of course. ﻿I don't know him. ﻿Do you want to have a drink with me? - ﻿Okay. ﻿- Have you already been to this bar? ﻿- No, it's the first time. - ﻿First time? - Yes. - ﻿What would you like to drink? ﻿- Soda. - ﻿Soda? - Yes! ﻿- Please! ﻿- What do you want, Sir? ﻿- A glass of cognac for the lady. - ﻿I'll have a beer. ﻿- Okay. - ﻿A cup of tea ﻿with some absinthe, please. ﻿I'll be next to the bar. ﻿- Quite an ambiance, right? ﻿- You can see how people are down here. ﻿- Aren't you working? Come here! ﻿Aren't you working? Hey, you! Come on! - ﻿Aren't you working? ﻿- Leave him alone! Drop that hook! ﻿- Stand up, go to work! ﻿- What do you do with that hook? ﻿- Do you want to work or not? - ﻿Go look for the boss. - ﻿Come here! - ﻿Do you want to work? ﻿Get out of my way! - ﻿Hey, Hamri! ﻿- What do you want? - ﻿You didn't tell me... ﻿- Excuse me? ﻿I think I saw you somewhere else... ﻿What's your name? - ﻿You saw me? Where? ﻿- Don't know, maybe on TV. Am I wrong? - TV huh? - ﻿Yes. ﻿- Maybe. ﻿We have to finish this... ﻿I hope the result will be wonderful. ﻿That's your business. - ﻿Give me more. ﻿- Why? ﻿You keep on inflating the check! - Move! ﻿- Leave it there, leave it there. ﻿He's here. ﻿I forgot what I wanted to tell you. ﻿Excuse me, I'm going to talk ﻿to somebody and I'll come back. - Who? - ﻿That man. - ﻿Is he Karim? - No. ﻿Don't be long. - ﻿Good night. ﻿- Good night. ﻿Are you making a film? ﻿No, we are just interviewing ﻿some people. ﻿Then you're going there. ﻿Excuse me, I'm going to see ﻿what this lady wants. - ﻿Who is he? ﻿- The film director. ﻿Where did you go before? ﻿There were a lot of people. ﻿I had to go. ﻿Besides, I was going to meet ﻿my friend at this bar. ﻿Perhaps it's your friend ﻿who will answer our questions. ﻿If you insist... - ﻿Can we film you? ﻿- You want to film me, too? - ﻿Do we have to? - Yes. I﻿n that case... ﻿Are you shooting a feature film? ﻿I can't say. ﻿- Can you interview me, too? ﻿- With great pleasure. ﻿Wait a minute. ﻿I have to check the camera. - ﻿Ready? ﻿- Ready. ﻿We are asking everybody about ﻿their opinion on cinema. ﻿Moroccan cinema... - You don't like the noise, right? - No. - ﻿Are you leaving early? ﻿- Why you ask me that? - ﻿I want to ask you for a favour? ﻿- Which one? - We want to take our drunken friend out. - I see. He would drink too much alcohol ﻿and he would make a blunder. ﻿Can you find a way to take him out? ﻿- Where's my beer? ﻿Excuse me, I forgot I'm coming back. - ﻿You heard me, right? - Yes. - ﻿We want him outside ﻿to make it easier for us. ﻿- I'll try. - Care for another drink? - ﻿No thanks! ﻿Hamid, Hamid! ﻿- Where were you? You're late. ﻿- I am in the bar since this morning! - ﻿I want to leave... - ﻿What happened? ﻿- I want to leave. ﻿- Ah, Hamid is here. ﻿- Be with us until the end of shooting. ﻿- Okay. ﻿I'm going to explain everything to you. - ﻿This man is not my friend. ﻿- Okay. ﻿- Frankly, he is not our friend. ﻿We want him outside. ﻿It's for business. ﻿You'll manage to take him out. ﻿Once he's out, ﻿you can leave. We want to talk to him, ﻿but we don't know each other. - ﻿Okay? ﻿- We'll see. - You will try? - Yes. - ﻿You promise? ﻿- We'll see. ﻿- Leave me alone, Laaidi. - ﻿Excuse me, I'd like ﻿to talk to the lady. ﻿- Would you interview me? ﻿- Yes, with pleasure... ﻿but let me ask ﻿the film director first, okay? ﻿Go, go. - ﻿No need to pay... ﻿- They are here! - ﻿Why so angry? ﻿- I want to beat him now. ﻿Calm down, my friend. ﻿- Do you like cinema? - Yes. ﻿- What kind of films do you like? ﻿- Moroccan films. - ﻿Do you like Moroccan films? - Yes. - ﻿What kind of films? ﻿- Have you seen a Moroccan film? ﻿- Maybe she meant Arabic films. ﻿- You meant karate films, didn't you? ﻿Karate films? - ﻿Do you like karate films? - Yes. - What about romance films? - Yes. - Do you like Egyptian films? - Yes. ﻿What about Indian films? - You don't like them? - No. ﻿You're beautiful. You would be a good actress. - ﻿You know you're pretty. ﻿- No, I don't know. - ﻿You don't know? - No. ﻿You don't look in the mirrors ﻿in your house? - ﻿Seriously, write her address down. ﻿- Sure, I'll do it. ﻿We'll talk to this man. ﻿He seems reasonable and smart. ﻿Come here, please. ﻿We were asking this woman to play ﻿in a film. How do you feel about it? - ﻿Sure, she has a face ﻿made for the movies. ﻿She's very beautiful. ﻿She could perfectly f﻿it in a character... - ﻿In a Moroccan film? ﻿- Sure, a Moroccan film. ﻿- Do you go to the cinema often? ﻿- Yes... ﻿What kind of Moroccan films ﻿would you like to see? ﻿The kind of cinema that I like... t﻿he films I like... are... t﻿he ones... ﻿- Historical films. ﻿- Yes, historical films. ﻿- Films talking about our society. ﻿- Yes, films talking about our society. ﻿That's all. - ﻿What's your name? ﻿- Malika. ﻿Let me have your address, we'll call ﻿once we find a role for you. ﻿- We'll call as soon as possible, okay? ﻿- Okay. - ﻿What is your name? ﻿- Malika Mesrar. ﻿Malika Mesrar? ﻿﻿It means beautiful. This name suits you very well. ﻿- What about your address? ﻿- Derb Benjdia. - ﻿Come whenever you want to. ﻿- Number 43. ﻿Excuse me, please. ﻿In Casablanca, right? ﻿Who the hell they think they are ﻿with their cameras! ﻿They've been here once ﻿and they think this is chaos! ﻿I'm going to bring Aïcha. ﻿Get out of here! I'll do it! - ﻿Do you like Egyptian films? ﻿- Not really. ﻿- I'll do it. - Come back, don't be stubborn! ﻿Mostafa! - How's that? ﻿- I don't know. ﻿I prefer American and French films. ﻿I'm good to you and you leave me. ﻿What the hell is that? ﻿Let us finish our interview, Sir. ﻿I don't give a damn. We were supposed ﻿to meet and she has to respect it. ﻿- I don't give a shit! ﻿- It's just an interview. ﻿I don't want to! We had a date, ﻿she's staying with me! - ﻿Leave him alone. ﻿- I don't want to listen to you. - ﻿Listen... ﻿- Go fuck yourself! ﻿Stop! Stop! ﻿I'm not going to do anything. ﻿- This fight will help me to get him... ﻿- You won't get him... - ﻿Cops are coming soon. ﻿- Have you seen his friends? ﻿I'm going to beat the shit ﻿out of him. Then, I'll go. ﻿I told you to go smoothly... ﻿I told you it's just an interview! ﻿I don't give a shit about ﻿your interview and your camera! - That's okay... - No! ﻿Leave him alone! ﻿Leave him alone! - ﻿That's okay... ﻿- I told you it's not. Leave me alone. ﻿These guys are violent! ﻿- You too? ﻿- They're looking for a fight. ﻿It's you, not me! - ﻿Do you go to the cinema at least? ﻿- I know nothing about cinema! ﻿- All this cinema you live in and you don't? ﻿- That's not your fucking business! - ﻿Laugh! - ﻿I don't want to laugh! Go away. ﻿Behaving like vulgar sailors... ﻿You have no manners. ﻿What? Am I rude? ﻿That's what you think? - ﻿Get out! ﻿- You should get out first! Beat it! ﻿- Tell me, you know what we are doing? ﻿- He told me you're interviewing people... I don't know, detective films ﻿and romance films... ﻿Which ones do you prefer? ﻿I don't know what to say. ﻿Every genre is special in its own way. ﻿What should we show ﻿in our Moroccan cinema? ﻿Do you think it should talk a﻿bout issues... ﻿- You, come here! That's enough! ﻿About life, women... ﻿- Come to work, come! ﻿- I think cinema should talk about... ﻿things that take place in real life. ﻿- Things like what just happened? ﻿- Yes, why not? - ﻿Our cinema should talk about social issues? ﻿- I just said so. I think we are done. ﻿Thank you, Miss! ﻿By the way, you're quite photogenic. - ﻿We might call you to play in a movie. ﻿- Yes, I'd like to. Thank you. ﻿Let's go, my friends. ﻿There. ﻿You can say that... ﻿Do you want to have dinner ﻿with me, tonight? ﻿- We'll eat fish at the Restaurant Du Port. ﻿- Okay. Great... ﻿Remember me? - ﻿Is this jacket yours? - Yes. - ﻿The hat as well? - Yes. ﻿Abbes! ﻿Mr. Abbes! Mr. Abbes! - ﻿I ran into two of your colleagues... ﻿- Yes. ﻿They're at the screening room, ﻿taking images of the criminal. ﻿The criminal? ﻿I don't understand... ﻿One of the guys you interviewed ﻿is a criminal. ﻿A guy stabbed another guy ﻿and I want to know everything about it. ﻿I'm against that. ﻿It's rolling, it's rolling. ﻿We're shooting. ﻿As I said before, ﻿I'm against showing this case. ﻿To make a scene of it! ﻿I don't agree with that. ﻿There are several reasons ﻿to kill somebody. ﻿Sentimental reasons, o﻿bscure reasons... ﻿But this man killed his boss... ﻿at work. ﻿- So what? ﻿- They worked at the port. ﻿So we have to consider more things ﻿besides the murderer, ﻿or the victim. ﻿It's about a whole world, ﻿where these people live. Maybe most of the port workers ﻿want to kill their bosses. ﻿He was the only guy ﻿who could do it. ﻿- Maybe they all want to do it secretly... ﻿- So they are all killers? ﻿No, they aren't ﻿But he couldn't help it. ﻿Nevertheless, the others dream ﻿of killing the bosses who submit them. ﻿Maybe there's a mafia ﻿controlling the port! ﻿Yes, this man is a criminal... ﻿but the problem is far more complex. ﻿Is that what you mean? His crime doesn't come from nowhere. ﻿There is a context in that port. ﻿Something provoked this situation. ﻿Just because a worker in the port ﻿committed a murder... ﻿doesn't mean ﻿there's a problem at the port! ﻿That's not the problem. - ﻿If someone who's working at SOMATAC, ﻿you'd say there's a problem at SOMATAC. ﻿I don't agree with you. That is a gesture... ﻿We have to consider that... - ﻿It's too noisy here, could we move? ﻿Sure, no problem. ﻿Let's go to the back. ﻿It's going to be much better. ﻿- Krimou, we're moving. ﻿- Okay, cut! ﻿How is that? - ﻿The style of this story... ﻿- We could write a script. ﻿We don't know this person. ﻿We only know about this incident. ﻿We can take him as film character ﻿We'll write the screenplay of a fiction. ﻿We'll call some actors ﻿to perform the story. ﻿That's a classical film. ﻿Your method is classical. ﻿﻿I don't think that's the cinema we want to do. ﻿That's a matter of fiction or inspiration. ﻿We don't need this crime to make this film. ﻿Unless we're going to change the story. ﻿I think since this crime happened ﻿and this big problem turned up. ﻿That made us think ﻿about cinema's truth, ﻿which is an echo to social, ﻿economical and political problems. ﻿It fits to a specific environment. ﻿If we go back to the current context, ﻿we won't use it as a set. ﻿It won't be superficial. ﻿We will take it on the spot. ﻿The way it really is. ﻿It means we should take into consideration ﻿this man's environment, the port, ﻿its workers, etcetera. ﻿The problems of workers such as our guy. ﻿From a technical point of view, ﻿insist on that... ﻿It's very important to us ﻿because we have very good raw material. ﻿The artist is the man ﻿who anticipates the occasion. ﻿The artist is not a regular guy. ﻿There are common people. ﻿Then, there is the artist. ﻿The artist is ahead of the occasion. ﻿So I think that movies guy ﻿such as the filmmaker, ﻿while making his film, ﻿he already perceived that such ﻿a dramatic event was going to take place. ﻿So if we say that we're going ﻿to create something afterwards... ﻿I think we would be doing ﻿a piece of classical cinema. ﻿If we were only to criticize ﻿instead of finding solutions ﻿lots of people won't be happy ﻿about you speaking in French. ﻿Imagine a film with half of the dialog ﻿spoken in Arabic and half in French. ﻿I don't see why not. ﻿Everybody will criticize you. ﻿Everyone understands cinema ﻿in his own way. The central issue of cinema is ﻿its role in acculturation. ﻿I think we don't need a cinema... ﻿which cuts us off from reality. ﻿Wait, there's a plane passing by. ﻿I can't hear a thing. ﻿Can we cut? Cut! ﻿We don't need a cinema ﻿which is not showing certain dimensions, ﻿which could be useful for changing, ﻿for solving our own problems. ﻿﻿If we do a fiction cinema which goes to a utopian direction, ﻿we'd be legitimating ﻿the companies discourse. ﻿Same thing with national ﻿and international associations. ﻿So our problems become ﻿more and more ambiguous. ﻿For example, ﻿films with karate champions... ﻿and violent movies, ﻿gratuitous and unreal violence. ﻿I'm not talking about violence ﻿in a creative way, ﻿I'm talking about ﻿an aesthetic representation of it. ﻿A cinema which doesn't tackle ﻿real problems makes films go wrong. ﻿I think that the most important thing ﻿about the cinema we want to do, ﻿is to consider it ﻿as a means of acculturation, ﻿and raising awareness. ﻿A global awareness, ﻿not focused on a single subject. ﻿If we force our spectators to accept ﻿the imposition of a hero ﻿and they see him ﻿as a positive role model, ﻿we're not going to be able ﻿to solve the real problem. ﻿He would be a hero ﻿for the bourgeois cinema. ﻿We see it everywhere ﻿but it really means nothing. ﻿We avoid real problems ﻿and we deal with them in another way. ﻿You don't think ﻿that cinema is bourgeois, too? ﻿Nowadays, ﻿bourgeois cinema is everywhere. ﻿For everything that happens, ﻿there's a filmmaker using it for his film. ﻿Everything has been used. ﻿Hollywood used the protests of students. - ﻿All cinema... ﻿- I don't think we are in Hollywood... ﻿and that we are here ﻿to use what happened. ﻿If you think ﻿about the case of this man, ﻿for using it in a film, ﻿like you were describing before. ﻿then we'd be bourgeois. ﻿but that's not ﻿what we're doing. ﻿We don't want to make ﻿the same mistake. ﻿The mistake you were saying. ﻿To make a commercial film. ﻿Giving a name to a problem ﻿and to get it ready to be consumed! ﻿That's not our intention We want ﻿to tackle the real problems of cinema. ﻿A cinema of truth, ﻿where all cultural subjects ﻿are exposed. ﻿As I was saying before, ﻿cinema can prove to be dangerous ﻿for a filmmaker! ﻿It can be used as a weapon, too. ﻿﻿Tell me, you and Abdellatif were colleagues? ﻿You don't want me to answer ﻿your question about cinema? ﻿We want to know your link with him, ﻿now you've been declared innocent. ﻿You used to get along well. ﻿Seems that you were childhood friends, ﻿you worked together at a theatre... ﻿He was my friend. ﻿We met at El Jadida. ﻿I used to work ﻿for the municipal theatre of El Jadida. ﻿We worked together ﻿for a short time, ﻿we used to get along well. ﻿He's a good guy. ﻿I never thought he'd be able ﻿to commit this kind of crime. ﻿I never thought he could use ﻿a knife to stab another man. ﻿What do you think ﻿about this crime story? ﻿I was declared innocent. ﻿I don't understand a thing. - ﻿How long have you been in custody? ﻿- Five or six days. - ﻿Didn't you know the truth? ﻿- When he was with me at El Jadida... ﻿he told me his story. He worked here, ﻿in Casablanca. ﻿He had some problems with his bosses ﻿and with his family. ﻿He looked for a solution ﻿for a long time, ﻿before deciding to go jail. ﻿It was the only solution. ﻿What do you know ﻿about this young man? ﻿He's a good guy. He never had ﻿this kind of problems before. ﻿- Did he work? - Yes, he did, but I don't know where. - ﻿Is he married? ﻿- I dont think so. ﻿- You're not sure? ﻿- He was very discreet. ﻿Did you know his parents? ﻿I saw them often ﻿but I didn't really know them. - ﻿Did his dad work? - ﻿Probably, he used to drive a car. ﻿What could you say ﻿about this young man? ﻿He was calm and discreet. ﻿He minded his own business. ﻿- Did he gamble? ﻿- No, no. - ﻿Did he drink? ﻿- I never saw him drinking or gambling. ﻿Are you aware of his case? ﻿I got sad when I knew. ﻿Never thought he was capable of that. ﻿He never provoked anybody. ﻿I'm surprised about it. - ﻿There's his sister ﻿- What? ﻿His sister. - ﻿Where is she? - There. - ﻿Why is she walking like this? ﻿- They just told her about her brother. Tell me, Sir. ﻿What are you doing with this camera? ﻿We're investigating the case. ﻿We want to help him. ﻿We want to know ﻿why he committed this crime. ﻿We want to know what happened ﻿when he decided to kill him. ﻿- We can't ask them now. - I think it's alright to do it. - ﻿No, forget it. ﻿You know these guys collaborated ﻿with the police to get him imprisoned. ﻿- We have to chase these pricks away! ﻿- Right now? ﻿You are quite too many... - ﻿﻿That's cinema. We have a cameraman... - That's way too much. ﻿Let us talk to him for a while. ﻿We might film him briefly. ﻿We have a sound technician, ﻿a cameraman and the rest of the team... ﻿- Everyone else will wait outside. ﻿- If you're two, that's fine. ﻿Only Nour Eddine! - ﻿You're going to sit here. ﻿- Okay. - ﻿Abdellatif is going to sit there. ﻿- Okay. ﻿Why did you lie to me ﻿when we first met? ﻿Did I lie? What lie? ﻿- Speak louder, it's so noisy out here... ﻿- Okay. ﻿You were filming my testimony ﻿for a TV program, something like that, ﻿my neighbours knew I was working. ﻿I leave at 8 o'clock ﻿and I come back at noon. ﻿Abbes, tell him it's too noisy here. ﻿Why exactly did you say you were a teacher? ﻿That's the first job ﻿I could think of. ﻿I'm not proud to say that I'm unemployed. ﻿I refuse the fact that I am. ﻿I want to work. ﻿But you were working at the port. ﻿Weren't you proud of working there? ﻿I'm not ashamed of my profession. ﻿I am an assembler. ﻿I got my degree from Qastalani Institute. ﻿I studied 3 years there. ﻿I haven't found a job since then. ﻿I got my degree when I was 15. ﻿I have looked for a job in vain. ﻿This is the reason why ﻿I became an actor! ﻿You played for which theatre company? ﻿The last one I worked with is Afifi. ﻿I worked with him in El Jadida. ﻿However, I quit ﻿for personal reasons. ﻿Then I went to Casablanca, ﻿where I founded a puppeteer company ﻿with some friends. - ﻿It didn't work, though. ﻿- Why? ﻿We had to face ﻿lots of difficulties. ﻿Lots of efforts for nothing. ﻿Besides, we had to bribe some guys ﻿in exchange for my rights. ﻿I hate corruption with all my heart! ﻿I just can't do it. ﻿I decided to let go of the puppets as well. ﻿Until the day I met Fofana. ﻿He introduced me to that man, ﻿who made me a proposition ﻿to work as a pointer at the port. ﻿What does a pointer do? ﻿I worked three days per month ﻿and I earned 1500 francs every day. ﻿I had to buy whisky and cigarettes ﻿for my boss. You already met him. ﻿- So the whole salary... ﻿- Yes, I had to give him everything ﻿in order to work that three days. ﻿I wanted to talk to him ﻿but I had to bribe him to keep my job. ﻿I told him but he wouldn't listen. ﻿So I menaced him, ﻿I told him I'd explain ﻿everything to his boss. ﻿He challenged me to do it ﻿and he insulted me. ﻿I answered and they kicked my ass. - ﻿Was he alone? - ﻿All his guys were with him. ﻿Four guys. ﻿They hit me and they left in his car. ﻿I had to answer. ﻿I had to kick his ass. ﻿But you had a knife, ﻿you wanted to do something else. ﻿I always have a knife on me. ﻿I use it to create my puppets. ﻿I don't work just at home, ﻿I worked in bars ﻿and in the street, too. ﻿- Do you see what I mean? ﻿- Sure. ﻿I always have this knife with me. - ﻿So you didn't want to kill him... ﻿- No, I just wanted payback. ﻿That's all. ﻿Things happened differently. ﻿The knife is always in my pocket. ﻿Do you know where I live? ﻿Hay Farah. - ﻿The knife is compulsory in Hay Farah? ﻿- Of course. ﻿You don't know that because you live downtown. ﻿You don't really know Hay Farah. ﻿I don't understand. ﻿What do you want from me? ﻿You want to know my intellectual level, ﻿is that it? You think ﻿that I intended to kill him. ﻿Is that what you want to know? ﻿﻿Cut the crap! Lets talk. ﻿Do you think killing somebody ﻿is going to change anything? ﻿And you think you're changing ﻿something with your camera? ﻿Listen... ﻿You've been following me for a while. ﻿Why? ﻿You think you understand my problems? ﻿You don't even know where Hay Farah is! How much did you pay to come here to film me... ﻿I don't even know you... ﻿and you came to me. ﻿Listen, you get to pick up your stuff ﻿and get the fuck out of here! ﻿You can just film the things ﻿you'll never dare to do. ﻿That's all you can do now. ﻿Cut the crap ﻿and pick up your useless stuff! ﻿It's useless! ﻿Sir, throw them out of here. And ﻿I'll tell you this... ﻿I didn't want to kill that guy. ﻿It was not my intention. ﻿But if I had to to it again, ﻿I'd kill him right now. ﻿That's something you'll never be able to do. Never! ﻿Production Contributors: ﻿The Artist Painters ﻿Mohamed Melehi - Miloud Labied ﻿Mohamed Chabaa - Mohamed Kacimi ﻿L.
