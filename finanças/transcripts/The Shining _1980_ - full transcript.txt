Hi. I've got an appointment with Mr. Ullman. My name is Jack Torrance. His office is the first door on the left. Thank you. [KNOCKS] - Mr. Ullman? - Yes. - I'm Jack Torrance. - Oh, come on in, Jack. - Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - This is my secretary, Susie. - Hello. - Susie, how do you do? - Any trouble finding us? No problem at all. I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours. That's very good time. Sit down a minute, Jack. Just make yourself at home. Like some coffee? If you're having some, I wouldn't mind. Thanks. - Susie. - Sure. And ask Bill Watson to join us. Yes, I will. [MUSIC PLAYS ON TV] Mom? Yeah? Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter? Sure I do. It'll be lots of fun. Yeah. I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here. I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends. Yeah, I guess so. What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet. [IN TONY'S VOICE] No, lain 't, Mrs. Torrance. Now, come on, Tony. Don't be silly. I don't want to go there. How come you don't want to go? I just don't. Did they give you any idea in Denver... ...about what the job entails? Only in a very general way. Well... ...the winters can be fantastically cruel. The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage... ...and depreciation which can occur. This consists mainly of running the boiler... ...heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis... ...repairing damage as it occurs... ...and doing repairs so the elements can't get a foothold. That sounds fine to me. Physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter... ...is a tremendous sense of isolation. That just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm outlining a new writing project. Five months of peace is just what I want. That's very good, Jack. Because, for some people... ...solitude... ...and isolation... ...can, of itself, become a problem. Not for me. How about your wife and son? Do you think they'll take to it? They'll love it. Great. Well, before I turn you over to Bill... ...there's one other thing I think we should talk about. Not to sound melodramatic... ...but it's been known to give a few people... ...second thoughts about the job. I'm intrigued. I don't suppose they said anything in Denver... ...about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970. I don't believe they did. ULLMAN: Well... My predecessor in this job... ...hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker. He came up with his wife and two little girls of about 8 and 10. He had a good employment record, good references. And from what I've been told, he seemed... ...like a completely normal individual. But at some point during the winter... ...he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown. He ran amuck... ...and killed his family with an ax. Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then... ...he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth. The police thought... ...that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin fever. A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur... ...when people are shut in together over long periods of time. Wow. That is... ...quite a story. Yeah, it is. It's still hard for me to believe it actually happened here. But it did. And, uh... ...I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it. I certainly can. I also understand why your people in Denver... ...left it for you to tell me. Obviously, some people can be put off... ...from staying in a place where something like that happened. You can rest assured that's not going to happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned... ...I'm sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her. She's a confirmed ghost story... ...and horror film addict. Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job? He already did. He's going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. - Hi, babe. - Hi, hon. How's it going? Great. I'm at the hotel and I still have a lot to go through. I don't think I can get home before 9:00 or 10:00. Sounds like you got the job. Right. It's a beautiful place. You and Danny are going to love it. Tony, why don't you want to go to the hotel? I don't know. You do too know. Now come on, tell me. I don't want to. Please. No. Now, Tony, tell me. BOY- We must really be high up. The air feels so different. Mm-hm. Dad? Yes? I'm hungry- You should've eaten your breakfast. We'll get you something as soon as we get to the hotel. Okay, Mom. Wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound? I think that was farther west, in the Sierras. Oh. What was the Donner party? They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times. They got snowbound one winter in the mountains. They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive. You mean they ate each other up? They had to in order to survive. Jack. Don't worry, Mom. I know all about cannibalism. I saw it on TV. See, it's okay. He saw it on the television. - What time does the plane leave? - 8:30. That gives us plenty of time to go over everything. - Goodbye, Mr. Ullman. - Bye. Good morning. I hope you haven't been waiting too long. No problem. We had time to grab a bite to eat. Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. - Hi. - Is your family having a look around? No, my son's discovered the games room. - Has your luggage been brought in? - Right there. Oh, fine. In view of all we have to cover today... ...I suggest we have a quick look at your apartment and get started. Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment. - Fine. - I'd better collect my family first. Oh, yes. This is our Colorado Lounge. It's beautiful. My God! This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon? It sure is. This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter. - Goodbye, Mr. Ullman. - Goodbye, girls. ULLMAN: And here are your quarters. Living room, bedroom, bathroom. And a small bedroom for your son. Perfect for a child. - Yeah. - Yes. WENDY: When was the Overlook built? Construction started in 1907. It was finished in 1909. The site's supposed to be on an Indian burial ground. They actually had to repel... ...a few Indian attacks as they were building it. That's our Snowcat. Can you both drive a car? BOTH: Yes. ULLMAN: That's fine. Basically the Snowcat operates very much like a car. It won't take you long to get the hang of it. This is the kitchen, huh? This is it. How do you like it, Danny? Is it big enough for you? Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen. This whole place is such an enormous maze. I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in. Don't let it get you down. It's big, but it ain't nothing but a kitchen. A lot of this stuff you'll never have to touch. I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did. One thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food. You folks could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice. Right here is our walk-in freezer. This is where we keep all of our meat. You got 15 rib roasts... ...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger. We got 12 turkeys, about 40 chickens... ...50 sirloin steaks, two dozen of pork roast... ...and 20 legs of lamb. Do you like lamb, Doc? - No. - You don't? What's your favorite food, then? French fries and ketchup. I think we can manage that too, Doc. Come along, now. Watch your step. Mr. Hallorann... ...how'd you know we call him Doc? - Beg your pardon? - Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice. - I did? - Yeah. We call him Doc sometimes, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons. But how did you know? I guess I probably heard you call him that. It's possible. But I honestly don't remember... ...calling him that since we've been with you. Anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn't he? [IMITATES BUGS BUNNY] Eh, what's up, Doc? Now, this is the storeroom. In here is where we keep... ...all the dried goods and the canned goods. We got canned fruits and vegetables... ...canned fish and meats, hot and cold cereals. Post Toasties, Corn Flakes, Sugar Puffs... ...Rice Krispies, oatmeal, Wheatena and Cream of Wheat. You got a dozen jugs of black molasses. We got 60 boxes of dried milk... [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] DICK'S VOICE: How'd you like some ice cream, Doc? DICK: Sociables, finger rolls... ...and 7 kinds of what have you. Now, we've got dried peaches, dried apricots... ...dried raisins and dried prunes. You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy. - Hi. WENDY: Hi. - How're you getting on? - Fine. Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance? We're on our way to the basement. I promise we won't keep her very long. No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just getting to the ice cream. - You like ice cream, Doc? - Yeah. I thought you did. You folks mind if I give Danny some ice cream while we wait? - Not at all. - We don't mind. - Good. - Sound good to you, Doc? - DANNY: Yeah. - Okay, you behave yourself. What kind of ice cream do you like? Chocolate. Chocolate it shall be. Come on, son. It's amazing, all this activity today. The guests and some staff left yesterday, but the... ...last day's always hectic. Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible. By 5:00 tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here. - WENDY: Just like a ghost ship, huh? - Yes. Do you know how I knew your name was Doc? You know what I'm talking about, don't you? I can remember when I was a little boy... ...my grandmother and I could hold conversations... ...entirely without ever opening our mouths. She called it "shining." And for a long time I thought it was just the two of us... ...that had "the shine" to us. Just like you probably thought you was the only one. But there are other folks... ...though mostly they don't know it, or don't believe it. How long have you been able to do it? Why don't you want to talk about it? I'm not supposed to. Who says you ain't supposed to? Tony. Who's Tony? Tony's the little boy that lives in my mouth. Is Tony the one that... ...tells you things? Yes. How does he tell you things? It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things. But when I wake up, I can't remember everything. Does your mom and dad know about Tony? Yes. Do they know he tells you things? Tony told me never to tell them. Has Tony ever told you anything about this place? About the Overlook Hotel? I don't know. Now think real hard, Doc. Think. Is there something bad here? Well... ...you know, Doc, when something happens... ...it can leave a trace of itself behind. Say, like... ...if someone burns toast. Well... Maybe things that happen leave other kind of traces behind. Not things that anyone can notice. But things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet... ...well... ...sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago. I think a lot of things happened right here... ...in this particular hotel over the years. And not all of them was good. What about room 237? Room 237? You're scared of room 237, ain't you? No, I ain't. Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237? Nothing. There ain't nothing in room 237. But you ain't got no business going in there anyway. So stay out. You understand? Stay out! [WOLF HOWLS] Good morning, hon. Your breakfast is ready. What time is it? It's about 11:30. Eleven-thirty, Jesus. I guess we've been staying up too late. I know it. I made them just the way you like them, sunny-side up. Nice. It's really pretty outside. How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast? I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first. Any ideas yet? Lots of ideas. No good ones. Something will come. It's just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day. Yep. That's all it is. [THUDDING] - All right. - And you're going to lose. And I'm going to get you. You'd better run fast! [WENDY HUMS] Look out! I'm coming in close. DANNY: Loser has to keep America clean. WENDY: Oh, no! DANNY: Keep America clean. Okay. Danny, you win. Let's take the rest of this walking. - Okay. - Whew. Give me your hand. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah. DANNY: Dead end. WENDY: Woo, we made it. - Isn't it beautiful? DANNY: Yeah. It's so pretty. Yeah. I didn't think it was going to be this big. Did you? Nope. [TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING] Hi, hon. How's it going? Fine. Get a lot written today? Yes. Hey, the weather forecast said it's going to snow tonight. What do you want me to do about it? Come on, hon. Don't be so grouchy. I'm not... ...being grouchy- I just want to finish my work. Okay. I understand. I'll come back later with a couple of sandwiches. Maybe you'll let me read something then. Wendy... ...let me explain something to you. When you come in and interrupt, you're breaking my concentration. You're distracting me... ...and it will then take me time to get back to where I was. Understand? Yeah. Fine. We're going to make a new rule: Whenever I'm in here... ...and you hear me typing... [PUNCHES KEYS] ...or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here... ...when I'm in here, that means I am working. That means don't come in. Now, do you think you can handle that? Yeah. Fine. Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here? Okay. DANNY: Missed! DANNY: Don't have! No fair anymore. [TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING] Oh, no. I knew it. This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1. KDK12 to KDK 1. This is KDK 1. We're receiving you. Over. Hi, this is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel. Hi, how are you folks getting on up there? Over. We're just fine. But our telephones aren't doing too well. Are the lines down, by any chance? Over. Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm. Over. Any chance of them being repaired soon? Over. Well, I wouldn't like to say. Most winters they stay that way until spring. Over. Boy, this storm is really something, isn't it? Over. Yes. It's one of the worst we've had for years. Is there anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance? I suppose not. Over. If you folks have any problems up there, just give us a call. And, Mrs. Torrance? It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time. Okay. We'll do that. It was real nice talking to you. Bye. Over and out. GIRLS: Hello, Danny. Come and play with us. Come and play with us, Danny. Forever... ...and ever... ...and ever. Tony“. ...I'm scared. Remember what Mr. Hallorann said. It's just like pictures in a book, Danny. It isn't real. Can I go to my room and get my fire engine? Come here for a minute first. How's it going, Doc? Okay. Having a good time? Yes, Dad. Good. I want you to have a good time. I am, Dad. Dad? Yes? Do you feel bad? No. I'm just a little bit tired. Then why don't you go to sleep? I can't. I got too much to do. Dad? Yes? Do you like this hotel? Yes. I do. I love it. Don't you? I guess so. Good. I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here forever... ...and ever... ...and ever. Dad? What? You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you? What do you mean? Did your mother ever say that to you? That I would hurt you? No, Dad. You sure? Yes, Dad. I love you, Danny. I love you more than anything else... ...in the whole world... ...and I would never do anything to hurt you... ...never. You know that, don't you? - Hm? - Yes, Dad. Good. [WIND HOWLING] [DANNY IMITATING ENGINE NOISES] Mom? Mom? Mom, are you in there? [JACK SCREAMING] [JACK GROANS] [JACK SCREAMS] WENDY: Jack! Jack? Jack! Jack! What happened? Honey... ...what's wrong? Jack? I had the most... ...terrible nightmare I ever had. - It was the most horrible dream. - It's okay, it's okay now. Really. I dreamed that I... ...that I killed you and Danny. But I didn't just kill you. I cut you up into little pieces. My God. I must be losing my mind. Everything's going to be all right. Come on. Let's get up off the floor. It's okay. There. Now sit up. It's okay. It's okay. Danny! Everything's okay! Just go play in your room for a while. Your dad's just got a headache. Danny, mind what I say. Go play in your room. Honey, let me just go get him out of here. I'll be right back. Danny. Why don't you mind me? Oh, Danny. Oh, my God. What happened to your neck? Danny, what happened to your neck? Huh? You did this to him... ...didn't you?! You son of a bitch! You did this to him! Didn't you?! How could you?! How could you?! Oh. [GROANING] God! I'd give anything for a drink. I'd give my goddamn soul... ...for just a glass of beer. Hi, Lloyd. A little slow tonight, isn't it? Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance. What Will it be? I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd... ...because I just happen to have two twenties... ...and two tens right here in my wallet. I was afraid they were going to be there until next April. So here's what: You slip me a bottle of bourbon... ...a little glass and some ice. You can do that, can't you, Lloyd? You're not too busy, are you? No, sir. I'm not busy at all. Good man. You set them up... ...and I'll knock them back, one by one. White man's burden, Lloyd, my man. White man's burden. Say, Lloyd... ...it seems I'm temporarily light. How's my credit in this joint, anyway? Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance. That's swell. I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you. You were always the best of them. Best goddamned bartender... ...from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine. Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter. Thank you for saying so. I never laid a hand on him, goddamn it. I didn't. I wouldn't touch one hair on his goddamn little head. I love the little son of a bitch. I'd do anything for him. Any fucking thing for him. But that bitch! As long as I live... ...she'll never let me forget what happened. I did hurt him once, okay? It was an accident. Completely unintentional. It could have happened to anybody. And it was three goddamn years ago! The little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor. All I tried to do was pull him up. A momentary loss of muscular coordination. I mean... ...a few extra foot-pounds of energy... ...per second, per second. WENDY: Jack! Oh, Jack. Thank God you're here. Jack. There's someone else in the hotel with us. There's a crazy woman in one of the rooms. She tried to strangle Danny. Are you out of your fucking mind? No. It's the truth! Really. I swear it. Danny told me. He went up into one of the bedrooms. The door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub. She tried to strangle him! Which room was it? [MUSIC PLAYS ON TV] NEWS NARRATOR: From Channel 10 in Miami... ...this is Newswatch with Glenn Rinker... ...Ann Bishop, and the award-winning Newswatch team. Good evening. I'm Glenn Rinker, News-watch Ten. As Miami continues to swelter in a record winter heat wave... ...bringing temperatures to the 90s... ...Central and Mountain states are buried in snow. In Colorado, 10 inches of snow fell in just a few hours tonight. Travel in the Rockies is almost impossible. Airports are shut down, stranding thousands of passengers. Highways are blocked by snowdrifts. Railroad tracks are frozen. Officials in Colorado tell Newswatch. .. ...at least three have been killed by exposure to freezing winds. The governor of Colorado is expected... ...to declare a weather emergency. The National Guard might be called out... ...to clear streets and roads. Weather forecasters predict more snow... ...and heavy winds tonight and tomorrow... ...with temperatures dropping well below zero. Back here in Florida, we've got the opposite problem. The heat and humidity are supposed to climb. Local beaches should be jammed. Our weather expert, Walter Cronice... ...will have the local forecast later on Newswatch. [HEART THUDDING] [WOMAN CACKLING] [RINGING] [MAN ON RECORDING]: We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. If you need assistance, please call the operator. [KNOCKING] Jack? JACK: Yes, it's me. Thank God. Did you find anything? No. Nothing at all. I didn't see one goddamn thing. You went into the room Danny said? To 237? Yes, I did. And you didn't see anything at all? Absolutely nothing. How is he? He's still asleep. Good. I'm sure he'll be himself again in the morning. Are you sure it was the right room? I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake. He must have gone in that room. The door was open, the lights were on. I just don't understand it. What about those bruises on his neck? Somebody did that to him. I think... ...he did it to himself. No. That's not possible. Wendy... ...once you rule out his version of what happened... ...there is no other explanation. Is there? [WENDY CRIES] WENDY: Oh, Jack. Whatever the explanation is... ...I think we... ...have to get Danny out of here. Get him out of here? Yes. You mean... ...just leave the hotel? Yes. JACK: It is so... ...typical of you to create a problem like this... ...when I finally have a chance to accomplish something! When I'm really into my work! I could really write my own ticket if I went back now, couldn't I? Shoveling out driveways, work in a car wash. - Any of that appeal to you? - Jack... Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far... ...but I am not going to let you fuck this up. [CAN RATTLING] [BALLROOM MUSIC PLAYING] [RINGING] [MAN ON PHONE]: Good evening. Forest Service. Hello, my name is Dick Hallorann. I'm the head chef at the Overlook Hotel. Good evening. What can I do for you? I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there... ...but the operator said that the phone lines are down. A lot of lines around here are down due to the storm. I hate to put you through any trouble... ...but there's a family up there all by themselves with a young kid. And with this storm and everything... ...I'd appreciate it if you'd give them a call on your radio... ...just to see if everything's okay. I'll be glad to do that. Why don't you call me back in about 20 minutes? Thank you very much. I'll do that. All right, sir. [BALLROOM MUSIC PLAYS] [PEOPLE CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Good evening, Mr. Torrance. Good evening. Hi, Lloyd. Been away, but now I'm back. Good evening, Mr. Torrance. It's good to see you. It's good to be back, Lloyd. What'll it be, sir? Hair of the dog that bit me. Bourbon on the rocks. That'll do her. No charge to you, Mr. Torrance. No charge? Your money's no good here. Orders from the house. Orders from the house. Drink up, Mr. Torrance. I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd. It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance. At least, not at this point. Anything you say, Lloyd. Anything you say. Oh! Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir. - Oh. - Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I've made an awful mess of your jacket, sir. Oh, that's all right. I've got plenty of jackets. I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir. It tends to stain. Advocaat, is it? Yes, sir. I think the best thing... ...is to come along to the gentlemen's room... ...and we'll get some water to it, sir. Looks like you might have got a spot of it on yourself... ...Jeevesy old boy. That doesn't matter, sir. You're the important one. Awfully nice of you to say. Of course, I intended to change my jacket this evening... ...before the fish and goose soiree. - Very wise, sir. Very wise. JACK: Here. I'll just... ...hold this for you there, Jeevesy. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Let's see if we can improve this with a little water, sir. All right. I'll just... ...set my bourbon and advocaat down right there. Won't keep you a moment. Fine. What do they call you, Jeevesy? Grady, sir. Delbert Grady. Grady? Yes, sir. Delbert Grady. That's right, sir. Uh... Mr. Grady... ...haven't I seen you somewhere before? Why, no, sir. I don't believe so. It's coming off now, sir. Uh... ...Mr. Grady... ...weren't you once the caretaker here? Why, no, sir. I don't believe so. You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady? Yes, sir. I have a wife and two daughters, sir. And... ...where are they now? They're somewhere around. I'm not quite sure at the moment. Mr. Grady. You were the caretaker here. I recognize you. I saw your picture in the newspapers. You... ...chopped your wife and daughter up into little bits. And... ...then you blew your brains out. That's strange, sir. I don't have any recollection of that at all. Mr. Grady... ...you were the caretaker here. I'm sorry to differ with you, sir. But you... ...are the caretaker. You've always been the caretaker. I should know, sir. I've always been here. Did you know, Mr. Torrance... ...that your son... ...is attempting to bring an outside party... ...into this situation? Did you know that? No. He is, Mr. Torrance. Who? A nigger. A nigger? A nigger... ..cook. How? Your son... ...has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is. But he is attempting to use that very talent... ...against your will. Well... ...he is a very willful boy. Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance. A very willful boy. A rather... ...naughty boy... ...if I may be so bold, sir. It's his mother. She... ...interferes. Perhaps they need a good... ...talking-to. If... ...you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps... ...a bit more. My girls, sir... ...they didn't care for the Overlook at first. One of them actually stole a pack of matches... ...and tried to burn it down. But I... ...corrected them, sir. And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty... ...I... ...corrected her. MAN [OVER RADIO]: KDK 1 calling KDK 12. Are you receiving me?

I can't really remember. You can't remember. No... ...I can't. JACK: Maybe it was about Danny? Maybe it was about him. I think we should discuss Danny. I think... ...we should discuss what should be done with him. What should be done with him? I don't know. I don't think that's true. I think you have some very definite ideas... ...about what should be done with Danny. And I'd like to know what they are. Well, I... ...I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor. You think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor? Yes. When do you think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor? As soon as possible? [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] "As soon as possible?" Please.

Give me the bat. - Stay away from me. - Wendy. - Stop it! - Give me the bat. - Stay away! - Give me the bat. Ah! Goddamn--! [WENDY CRIES] [GROANING] What are you doing? Hey. Wait a minute. What are you doing? What are you doing? Uh! Oh! JACK: Wait a minute! [BANGING ON DOOR] What are you doing? Open the door! Goddamn it! Let me out of here! Open the goddamn door! Wendy, listen. Let me out and I'll forget the whole goddamn thing. It'll be just like nothing ever happened. Wendy, baby. I think you hurt my head real bad. I'm dizzy. I need a doctor. Honey. Don't leave me in here. I'm going to go now. I'm going to try... ...to get Danny down the Sidewinder... ...in the Snowcat today. I'll bring back a doctor. Wendy. WENDY: I'm going to go now. Wendy. Yes. You've got a big surprise coming to you. You're not going anywhere. Go check out the Snowcat and the radio, and you'll see what I mean. [JACK LAUGHING] Go check it out. Go check it out! Go check it out. [GRUNTING] [KNOCKING] Wendy? GRADY: It's Grady, Mr. Torrance. Delbert Grady. Grady? Oh, Grady. Grady, uh... Hello, Grady. Mr. Torrance... ...I see you can hardly have taken care of the... ...business we discussed. No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here. Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance? I wonder. I have my doubts. I, and others, have come to believe... ...that your heart is not in this. That you haven't the belly for it. Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady. That's all I ask. Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more... ...resourceful. She seems to have got the better of you. For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment. I fear you will have to deal with this matter... ...in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance. I fear... ...that is the only thing to do. There's nothing I look forward to... ...with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady. You give your word on that, do you, Mr. Torrance? I give you my word.

Come out, come out, wherever you are. Danny... ...I can't get out. Run! Run and hide! Run! Quick! Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in. Not by the hair on your chinny-chin-chin? Then I'll huff... ...and I'll puff... ...and I'll blow your house in! [WENDY SCREAMING] Please! Don't! Don't! Stop it! Here's Johnny! Ah! [SNOWCAT ENGINE RUMBLING] DICK: Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Hello? Anybody here? [YELLS] [DICK AND DANNY SCREAM] Danny! Danny-boy! Danny? Danny. Danny. Danny? [PEOPLE CHANTING] Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! I'm coming!
