There goes my perfectly clean criminal record. It's not the only thing about you that's perfect. Fuck me, this is wicked. Maddie, let's go, Madds. Can't go down. You're abducted. This is the best thing that's happened all year. Holly shit. You guys down for rum now? Has a drink in there somewhere. Did you think car will be all right? Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere. Yeah but, it's only brown car, security and stuff. We'll be fine. You all right? Yeah. This place is great. We'll be in and out, an hour or so. I'll go pick up the car, we vamoose. Let's have a look around. We'll be fine. I'll just go make sure they're not dead yet. Really Adam? What? I don't know, less noise maybe. This abandoned fireworks here, where no one's been for like a million years? No, in this creepy abandoned facility, where nobody knows we are, and we're not supposed to be. And nobody's been for a million years. You are so sexy right now. So, how far down do you say this place is? I have no clue, 200 feet? You have no clue? What's that? This, Maddie is is 10 million candle power, of glorious high-intensity torch light. Thought you knew all about this place. Your was supposed to be the expert. Adam, It's called exploring. I know. Wow. Ladies first. Cheers. Wait, you knew about this? You know it's cool. Transition a. What you doing? Drawing a map. How far do you think we've come? Good idea Madd. We did a left, then a right, then a left. Make sure you mark down everything we discover. This could be history. ♪ How can I make you want me ♪ ♪ Half as much as I want you ♪ ♪ My heart of stone is happy ♪ ♪ Is there... ♪ Shit, sorry. I just got close with the biggest spider in the world. Fucking spider? I fell and one of the boxes bit me. A spider bit you? No it's a box. Come Alex, is it deep? No, I'll live. Still have a blast or something. I still don't get why they're punishing her now. We have to make an example of her. Still, seems like overkill to me. All those kids is still in hospital. I thought they were from the neighboring academy. They were. So that makes them at least two years older than her. Those aren't Kids. Johnson, it was an exercise. That got out of hand. She's got a problem with authority. Sounds like a day ruse to me. Shut up leftenant Johnson. I'll wait here. Sergeant Davies, it is. It's good to be here. And it is a pleasure to see you, always. I know you are a man of action so, to business? This, is to go with on your forthcoming neutralization, and extraction mission. That contains a great deal of information, which will be pertinent to your forthcoming mission. In Latin. You object, because it is perhaps too heavy? I'm sure I can arrange someone to carry it for you. I object. I'm taking my team on a mission, where the only intel that makes sense, is in Latin. The intel is solid. Respectfully. I was told this was an enemy of a small civilian group, who are going to penetrate a company owned facility. Now why are we being sent in so late? And what does this notebook have to do with it? Sergeant Davies... I understand the need to keep something like this quiet... You understand nothing. Least of all the importance of this mission. Please keep in mind that your team is just one of many. And if this company is failing to provide you, and the rest of Team Seven with adequate remuneration for your services, then I hear The Circuit holds many lucrative opportunities to be shot up by rebels or some such nonsense. Please, think of your daughter's future. Sergeant Davies, please do not confuse this company's government affiliations, with working for the government. You are a private contractor, with a reputation For fine work, which should not be sullied by asking too many questions. Imagine what a waste of your team's talents it would be, if an opportunity like this were to pass you by. The unusual skill set, and unsavory histories of the men and women under your command, do not lend themselves well to more conventional occupations. Good read is it Sarge? Mostly pictures Matthews, you'd like it. Come on. Yeah, stop working it. Okay Smile Am I Barack Obama? No. He's never gonna get it. He has self doubt, I'll have got this. Yeah, right. Eight questions left, dipshit. Might as well be none. Respectfully sir, my man's got this shit. Private Matthews, you have eight questions left. Am I Janet Street-Porter? What the fuck is wrong with you? Told you. How could you... You already asked if you were a man. Seven. You already know you're a man. Are we playing a hunch? Fucking seven, happy now? There's no chance. Sir, I think your negativity, is fucking up his chee. No amount of chee is gonna make him smarter. Or a hunch? He doesn't even know who Janet Street-Porter is. Yes he does, don't you? And I think he should be allowed more questions. Does he even knows who Barack Obama is? Piss off, can he have more questions, why? Special dispensation. Of being a dipshit. How the hell is that fair? Quiet. We're going in cold here. Tracking unknown targets, into an unknown military facility that's been abandoned for reasons unknown. Do you know they wanted me to pick a team? And I said, "No." You know why? Bell, do you know why I said no, when they said, "Sergeant Davies, "We need you to pick a team." Sir, no, sir. Because I have the best goddamn team on the circuit. I said, "They're the fastest, the smartest, "the baddest team of motherfucking killing machines, "you might ever have the misfortune of meeting." Yes, sir. I said, "There's a reason they're the best. "They've seen it all, they've been through hell, "and they've dragged me back." And if dipshit here mistook the warm rocking motion of this van, while his bee sting dick for a hunchback Janet Street-Porter, that's his look out. Thank you Sarge. Why would she put bars in a tunnel? The two run section of a part of the tunnel system that's unsafe. Or you don't want people to go down. Bars like these, are for one of two reasons. Grace, are you coming? That's interesting init? Are you sure this it, Sarge? Sarge, tracks lead this way. What's it for? That's what I wanna know. A supply tunnel or something? No doors, no sign saying how we've come, nothing. I'm okay. Shit, that wasn't weird at all. Maybe these tunnels go downwards, as well as out or along. Yeah, maybe. Come my ears keep popping something wicked. Really? Mine are fine. Yeah. You okay? Yeah, just it was as if Do you guys not feel that? Oh, do you want a mint? It might help if your ear has a problem. Thanks. I just shit myself. Is there a mint for that? Come on, that was just an echo. From me shouting just now. Why are you whispering then? Cause Braveheart here has farted first. Piss off, I was joking, wasn't I? Am I Lance Armstrong? Cut it out. Fucking cool. Okay, group shot. Let's go. Madds great, if you go in the middle, that's it. Yeah, are you ready? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Ready, smile. Yeah, that's good. We ready? Yeah. Hey look at this. They're nice. You look great. Madds, you wanna see? You coming, though? Yeah, two secs. Beccs. Wait up, yeah. What the fuck? How is this place, coming up with even more weird shit? That's not right, right? It's fucking brilliant. Like oh my God, I'm gonna shit you up, and probably murder you brilliant. Who put it there? Why did they put it there? And why is that light on? Oh shit. You all right? Did you see that? See what? Oh shit. Maybe there's a dodgy connection somewhere. This place is ridiculous. I'm sorry I ever said it was boring. Shut up Ad. Grace, are you all right? No, I don't think so. I think she needs a minute, mate. Come on, can't you see she's freaked out? No, no, no, no, no I'm fine I just got a bit spooked in the dark. I thought I saw a.... Base, this is Team Seven. We're entering the tunnel. Base, please repeat. Bell, anything? Sorry Sarge, I'll try again here. What did the manual say? Piss off. Base, just say it again, repeat. Looks like we're on our own. Won't be the first time. I want this clean and simple. We have five civilians down here. Let's get moving. They've been here no more than an hour. So they can't have gotten far. Taylor take point. Bell, you're with me. Keep trying base. Matthews, bring up the rear. There is something not right about all of this. It's pretty weird. You know what I mean. Come on. And the lights being on, and that weird noise. Come on, it can't be that much further to go. Madds, you were drawing a map, right? Well, how far have we come? Well, I only managed to get through a couple of corners, and then I sort of distracted. Help with that. What's it like? It's detailed. It's really not that great. Okay, let's just try another couple of corners and if anything else weird happens, we are out of here, right? Kiss the puss darling. Is that blood? Don't touch. I know you'd give it a lick too. Move out. Okay, everyone keep still. Okay, ready. Okay you're gonna have to make a hole. That's intrusive. Becca. Jesus, what the fuck? Wait, no, no we gotta stay together. What the fuck is that? Maddie, Grace. Hold your fire. Stop fucking shooting. Enima. She went through here. What was that noise? I think it was gunfire. Becca is through here, there's nowhere else she could be. I found her Maddie you found her, didn't you? She was sucked into the wall, or ceiling, she could be fucking anywhere. I know if it was true to the fuck... Ad, that shit's not helpful. Becca is through here, and there's gun fire coming from that direction. So help me get this door open. Now. What the fuck was that Sergeant? Hold your fire and keep your fucking heads together. Move up. Taylor, take a look. Sorry Sarge, nothing yet. Keep trying. All right, what the fuck just happened? They were old soldiers firing at us. Keep it locked down, both of you. But we were taking fire. Taking fire, from who exactly? Sergeant, they were old soldiers firing. Now who the fuck were you firing at Mathews? They were old soldiers. Jesus Christ. Report soldier. What did you see? I... - Shit. - Shit. It's locked stuck solid. What we gonna do? We're gonna get through this door, and find Becca. Okay. What we need, is a crowbar or something. Where are we gonna find a bloody crowbar? I don't know, but this thing isn't moving. Quick, quick. What the fuck was that? Why do I know that sound? What are we gonna do? I don't want to die down here. Now, I've me your belt. What? G, What the fuck? Not a debate. Hold here. Don't let go. Right foot. Okay. Look, stump at three. One, two, three. Again, one, two, three. Motherfucker, fuck off. Fuck off. All right captain, Jesus Christ. Fuck you. Fucking just die. Fuck you. Taylor. Bell. Fuck. Fuck. Again, one, two, three. One, two, three. Fuck yeah. Motherfuckers. Matthews take point, I wanna clear run that way. Yes sir. Taylor, cover him. Pick off any strays. Sir. It fucking beat me Sarge. Can you fight, private? Sir, fuck yeah, sir. - Johnson. - Sir. The private here needs a strong arm. Ready? Let's go big boy Move out. Has this place been closed, since like the fifties? That's some super-charge, long-life battery shit right there. Becca. Jesus Christ. Bec... No, no, no, no, no. We'll find her, but quietly. We have to be quiet. Fuck. Hold position. I get the feeling we're being herded. Where? Position X. The door. We can't hold it, go, go, go. Go, go, go. This way. Are you kidding? Turn that shit off. What shit? The music, somewhere in here. ♪ Cause I thought ♪ It's off. What music, you nutter. There's no music. You didn't hear that? I think we lost it. Oh yeah? Where are we? Another stairwell? Where did Adam and Grace go? I think they went right, we went left. Hopefully they are hidden in a room somewhere. Should we go back? I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna run into, whoever it was who is firing. I've got to go back. Okay, cool. There's no music playing, G. Taylor, keep it together. Sweep that room. Clear. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. It bit me, Johnson. Don't let them grab you. Easy Bell, easy now. They change you. Don't let them take me. I'm here, I won't let you go. Sarge. Sarge. What the fuck is going on? I said, what the fuck is going on Sarge? Stand down soldier. No, let him talk. What's on your mind, Taylor? What's on my mind. What's my mind? What's on my mind? I'll tell you what's on my fucking mind. Just exactly what the fuck we're supposed to be doing down here in the first place. This is no routine enemy. Now here we are, two men down, trapped and barely escaping fire fights from, please correct me if I'm wrong, ghost soldiers or some shit. Not to mention whatever the fuck those bandage-headed things are. Are you finished private? What's in the fucking book, sir? Oh, There it is. I saw you checking those fucking symbols, or runes, or whatever. What's in the fucking book, Sarge? Well? The mission still stands. We complete the enemy, and we get the fuck out of here. Both clear? Yes sir. Yes sir. Johnson, pull up the monitor. Got something Sarge. I've got, Mathews. He keeps dropping in and out. Stop shaking it. I can't work this fucking thing. - Bell would... - There. He's moving, he's alive. We're all going to die down here. I've got something, Sarge. It keeps dropping in and out. Stop shaking it. I can't fucking work this thing. Bell would... There. He's moving, he's alive. Oh no. Motherfuckers. Holly shit. What's it doing? It's recruiting. Turning Mathews into one of those things. I've seen enough, Johnson. Store the monitor. Ready to move sir. What about Bell, Surge? We'll circle back for her, we're not leaving her behind. Are they gone? I don't know. Stay there. They're gone. Thank fuck. What are we going to do? I don't know. What do you think enemy means? No clue, but I don't think this is all going to plan. No better thing to know what those things are, anymore than we do. I think they're down here for them, I think they are not here for us. We need to find Steve, and Maddie, and Becca and get out of here. I'm not okay going with you. This morning we were in a cafe, and now we're in a room with a dead body. I know, this place is... Fucked up. Yeah. Like emergency red lighting, there's sirens. Actually, why the lights even on at all? What you on, G? What sirens? Shit shit. It's going wayback. Yeah. What you do if it's inside of that room? Maybe we can wait for it to leave, or something. Look, we can't go through, or round. But we can go over. Wait. What about the walkie talkies? I turned those off. What if they are hiding like us, and one of those things is nearby? We can give them away by accident. Madds, Adam's gonna be all right. Yeah, I know. He's with Grace. No, I don't remember any flashing red lights, or hearing any random creepy music coming from the walls. Or having any other kind of mental breakdown. Yeah, that's right. I am not having a mental breakdown. Are you off your pills? And when did this sudden door, the light in the end of the tunnel, this random door you saw in the middle of the tunnel, while the rest of us vanished? I don't know, it's just a door. I know it's a cell door. Grace, your freaking me out, yeah? I can't move. Something's holding me here, but I can't see it. Grace, Grace, Grace. I want to go home. Me too shit head. Sis, okay now this is freaking me out. Try the walkie talkies, just to see if that is on. Okay. Turn the volume down. Just let me know if it happens again, or something though, yeah? It's okay, just tell me. It's not my fault. Let me know if anything else weird happens, yeah? Promise. Okay. I've got nothing in these. I bet that Steve turned his off. No, that's not gonna keep them away if they're hiding. Yeah, I guess. Let's try the other door. You know it's still gonna be locked. I'm hungry. Cheers. So why didn't you say anything earlier about the stuff you were seeing like, while it was actually happening? I don't know Ad, I'm sorry, okay? If I were to see something like that, I'd have told you. I know, just didn't wanna make a fuss, sort of. Shit, you sound like an old woman. You know I don't. Yeah you do. Oh no dears, I don't know make a fuss, It's only a broken ankle. Wait, did you just? You ready? No, no I'm not ready. Did you just pick that fucking lock with a hairpin? What? I said, did you, just pick that lock with a hairpin? No. But, yeah. Wicked. Did Steve show you how to do that? Yeah, that must be it. Look, are you ready? Yeah, yeah, do you think he'd show me how to do that? Run, go, go. Let go of my sister. What's it doing? Shh. Looks inviting. What are all of these for? Once you get used to the, you know, paralyzing sense of terror. Maybe, they're motion activated. I don't think so. Becca. Beca. Get open. Oh shit. The fuck you do that for? Why the fuck did you shut the door? Johnson. This shit can barely open. Come on, it gotta get open. Johnson. Come on, get out. Come on. Sergeant. Easy now, we're not going anywhere. I'm lowering my weapon. Can you understand me? Didn't even slow it down Sarge. It was strong. Jesus. Johnson, where the fuck is your weapon? Shit. Do the work and we're gone, all right? We're also running low on munitions. If there was ever a good time to fall back and... Bell should have at least one clip still on her. Okay, Bell first. Our walkies are useless, but there's an old radio room on the ground floor. That part of the facility still has power, which means we might be able to punch a signal out from there. Let's move. I'd rather go back down the stairs, than to fall into that lot. I'm in, maybe we can go round another way. I don't want to keep coming back here. How are we going to find them, looking in places we've already been? You know they aren't there because we've already been there. Ad, I've already told you, we need to work out where we are before this... Don't fucking move. I said, don't fucking move. Easy soldier, we're unarmed civilians. Shut up. We're unarmed. No threat here. Shut up. Where the fuck is Bell? Okay, which one is it gonna be? What? Lower your weapon. Sarge. What you like the young lady to do? Shut up, or tell you where Bell is? At ease. What's your name? I'm Francis, this is Adam. Grace. I'm Grace, and this is Adam. I'm sergeant Davies. This is private Taylor, and leftenant Johnson. Now Grace, there was a body in that room. Do you know where it went? We saw a thing that... We saw something take the body. We didn't take the body. Why'd we do that? Jesus, Ad. What? He's just staring at us. At least I know one thing. He knows we didn't take the body. Bell, they know we didn't touch Bell's body. So it's just you two down here? Yeah, no one else. No, there's three others, and we'd very much like to find them. Very good. We move to the radar room. Sarge, what about Bell, sir? If we're gonna find her, we will. But our next objective is the radio room. Taylor, I want you at the rear with Johnson. Adam, Grace, you stay behind me. Let's move. Maddie. Madd. You've got a knife? I'm tired of running around. I don't know who's chasing us. I understand but, we need to go. The knife, it is something. Christ. Madd what are you doing? Nice. And that's foul. It has the white. Stay close. What does that mean? No sight of the stuff in your book Sarge. Quiet. Hey, you all right? You don't hear that? Can you hear me? Shut up. 'Cause I can fucking hear you. Good. I thought I totally lost my shit. Which way? Which way did he go? Quiet. Give me the monitor. We move. Now. Where the fuck are we going? Shut up, Adam. Hey. Madds, do... Do I know this place? I've, Steve, we've... Been here before. I remember. Steven, I remember we were supposed to be working then... Madline. What have we done? Already? But, but, Steven we haven't finished. How can... It must be Ovin, we must go to him. Run along, now. Oh God. Bloody hell. You tried. Back at the blackboard room, What did you see? Nothing. Did you see Mathews? A man, standing against the wall? Red lights? Did you hear the evacuation siren? No, no and no. But I watched, you looked freaked out. Yeah, I saw all that. Seriously? Yeah, Seriously. And there was a song. Did you hear the song? I've heard it before somewhere, but I can't remember where. You said, you heard it in the tunnel. Yeah, but it feels really familiar now, and I remember it from before the tunnel. Still open out. It must be closed. G, where you Can you tell me why your here? A test. I'm not exactly sure what for, it's a... No. I'm sorry, I can't remember. That's perfectly normal. Fraid all of this, it's very normal. Yes, it is. Just a few more questions, all right? Yes sir. Where were you born? England. Where exactly in England? England. This is the test. Yes. I would very much like to pass. You're doing very well. We're almost finished. Shall we? Yes. What is your name? You okay? You said a load of weird shit, then fell down. I'm okay, you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Okay. No, I'm fine, really. Humor us. You said it's going to close, remember that? Adam, I think there's something very wrong with me. I have this weird feeling, that I've forgotten to do something, that's so important our lives depend on it. And at the same time, it's not mine to do. It's someone else's problem. It's going to be all right. G, we just need to get you put of here. Yeah? Right? I have distant memories of studying everything in this book. From before this mission started. But I know things about it now, that I didn't know before. I can understand sections of this, like it's not written in fucking Latin. I've got this weird feeling, I know there's an answer here. I have something. Fuck me. It keeps moving through the bandwidth. That's it. Real comfy then. How about this though? Let's get the fuck out of here. He makes a solid argument. Seconded. Okay, but we're receiving something. So it's possible to transmit. Request a pick up at the tunnel entrance in two hours. This is Team Seven. We've suffered multiple losses. We request an extraction from drop point, in two hours. At 20, 1800 hours. Repeat. This is team seven, we've suffered multiple losses. Request extraction at drop point in two hours. At 20, 1800 hours. So if your starting to understand that book, is there anything in there about what happened down here? I can't understand all of it, but from what I can tell, they were experimenting with planetary alignments, and perpetual energy States, and... And the demonic vision, that would swallow our world whole, if not summoned properly. Something went very wrong. Sarge? It wasn't me. It wasn't me. Johnson. They keep showing. It wasn't me. We, no, no, no, no, no. Weren't there. They found patterns, in ancient documents. And underneath it all, They found instructions. Just one remaining. Holy shit. What did we do? Davies, it's not you. What your seeing, it's not what you did. Oh, brilliant. They had influence. They made us do things, then forget. We said the words. And we fed it. It makes you forget, makes you forget. It wasn't our fault. It was influencing us. Even before, even before. You can't close it now. Get up, soldier. We need to move, now. Through here. How you doing there, Sergeant Davies? We weren't in control. We were being guided. Instead, we had to do these things. Sergeant. Listen, he's gonna be okay. As long as we can get them out of here. I know what he's going through, sort of. He's being flooded with memories, of things that happened here. Give me his gun. I recognize this. But at the same time, I don't. I know how to handle a weapon, but that isn't my memory. It's the same with this place, and that soul, and I know I've got to close something. We need to get you both out of here. Further away from this facility we can get him, the better off he'll be. He's not the only one. Steve? Steve. Grace. Grace, Grace. Where's Adam? I don't know, they take the bodies. He's not a body. Grace, they took him. Where is my little brother? Help me, he's injured. We all need to get out, and then we bring back help. You've got one job to do Johnston, so listen carefully. Get Davies and that notebook, safely out of this tunnel. You have four rounds left in here, plus whatever you got in yours. Give me your knife. Give this to Adam. Grace, come with us. You can't help Adam now. First we get out, then we bring back help. One job Johnson, don't fuck it up. I'm going to find my brother. You heard the lady. Grace, Grace. Oh God, Maddie, Maddie. I'm sorry, Madd. I didn't mean to. I didn't. It's okay. I'm sorry Madd. It was an accident G. I know, it's okay. Just come over here. I killed her. I know. It's okay. Just come over here. Adam, get up and come here now. I'm not leaving her. No. No I am sorry. What? What are you? You have precious little time. Did you do this? Yes, and no. I am sorry. Please, wait. Do you feel that? That strength is me. This, is you. Adam. I can help you. But we must hurry. I want to make certain, you understand the gravity of what's happening here. The importance. You must The fail safe must fall. Only this, and close them. Unwilling Okay, okay. Enough. Enough? You stand facing a door, that's been closed for millennia. A door that 60 years ago, men were tricked into opening. It was an unwilling sacrifice, and that I've been holding closed ever since. Now, only you can help me close it. Why? What's on the other side? Door is this. It is coming, Grace. The devourer of worlds. Hunger, everlasting. That is not it's true shape. Even it cannot remember that many eons ago. Destruction now is an amalgam, of all the life in this world. It infects and consumes everything. Finally becoming just one life form. Even ever since it reached here, it has been probing our world. What can we do? You know what we must do. No. It must be closed. No. We must fall. No. Thank you. Let's go. Sorry. It's got to close, G. You must fall. Johnson. Johnson, no. Johnson. ♪ My life makes me lonely ♪ ♪ Like the way I need you too ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm falling, falling slowly ♪ ♪ And there's nothing I can do ♪ ♪ How can I make you want me ♪ ♪ Half as much as I want you ♪ ♪ My heart of stone is happy ♪ ♪ Is there nothing I can do ♪
