'..I am looking for you on roads.' 'In your street, your crazy lover..' '..is selling his heart for cheap.' 'Make this deal. Take my heart and give yours.' 'Dear, o dear.' 'Dear, o dear.' Sit down, Imartilal. Darling, why do you wait and go hungry for me every day? Eat the meal. What wonderful Biryani! You call it Jehangiri Biryani, right? What good smell! Here, eat some. Eat. Eat. Sir, you did not eat properly today. I had cooked very good food. Yes, you had cooked very good food. That Jehangiri Biryani was so good.. ..it would have pleased king Jehangir in heaven. Go and eat some. - Don't know what's wrong with my hunger. Before going to sleep I was very hungry. And now after waking up I feel my stomach is full. Jai Ram Ji Ki (greetings), Imartilal. You've done a favor on Lord Ram.. ..by calling him in the morning. Now in Lord's name give me a day off. This drinking problem of yours.. Motilal, I drank a bit too much last night. Wow! Very good! You drink to get a high every night. In the morning you drink to get out of the hang over. And in the afternoon.. - Take the telephone. Hallo. Greetings, Mr. Diwan. I see. Mr. Diwan is asking whether he can come now. Don't let such unlucky people.. ..come here so early in the morning. Tell him I will meet him at the hotel. Mr. Diwan, sir is busy with Pooja. You don't need to come here. He will meet you at the hotel. Tell me what the news is. - Well, the news is bad. I know that. You never remember me when it's good news. Raja, we're running out of time. The plan you'd showed me.. ..if you won't complete that scheme soon, we'll lose it. Her Highness has prepared the will. If she won't find her lost grand daughter.. ..property worth crores of rupees will go to the temple trust. Couldn't you find any girl whom we could.. ..present and prove to her as her grand daughter? Raja, perhaps you don't realize that.. ..at the rate of 30% share, you're going to get 2.5 crores. What are you thinking? - I am not thinking: I am counting, Mr. Diwan. That at the rate of 70% share, how much are you going to get? I will increase your share.. ..first find out some girl whom we can trust. I know it is a matter of few seconds.. ..for you to make a living man dead. But I am to make a dead person alive. Won't I take some time? I wish fate would bring me across a girl whose age.. ..is 20 years now, like the dead princess Ratna would be. And that girl should have a beauty spot.. ..below the neck, exactly where princess Ratna had. But such miracles don't happen.. ..without the blessings of deities. The problem is that the deities know how pious people we are. You never stop joking. But, Raja, this matter is very serious. Because Her Highness is above 70 years of age now. She's like a dying flame. Can die any moment. Don't worry about the life of Her Highness. Wherever you might be, I wish you a happy 19th birthday, child. Come, Rajmata (Your Highness). 12 years have passed by, priest. How many days do I have to face this bad luck yet? When will I find my dear grand daughter? Have patience, Rajmata. The moment of union is approaching.. ..like the shooting star in the sky. Priest, you've been saying these words for last 12 years. When will that shooting star reach the earth? Why do you forget that Mother Goddess.. ..came herself to Rajmata's dream and blessed her.. ..with a boon that princess will return soon. The words of goddess are always true. Pratap is still a child, Mr. Pratap. We cannot expect him to be as patient as me. He is also waiting for her like I am. They used to play together when they were kids. That's why I like to see Pratap around me. O, what inauspicious moment that was.. ..when I left to Prayag for the Kumbh bath. But.. but how did all that happen? Mr. Khan! - Yes? - You must be knowing about it. You were with them till the last moment. Sir, it had been only 3 days after Rajmata had reached Prayag. Our old enemy Tejasingh.. ..sent us a false telegram saying she was ill. As soon as we got the telegram.. ..His Highness left for Prayag by car.. ..with the princess and the queen. I was also with them. We were having a good time on the way.. ..listening to the sweet words of the princess. The goons have attacked us. Sir, please leave with the queen and the princess. I'll handle these robbers. Himmat Singh, you cannot save yourself from Tejasingh today. Mommy! - Kesar! Kesar! Kesar! Kesar! Kesar! - Mommy! Kesar! You shameless dog! Come out and face me! Why are you hiding over there? Come out in open if you dare. Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Mr. Diwan! - Yes? Distribute these things to the poor in the name of Ratna. As you order, Rajmata.

Here, Shanno. - Thank you, sir. She makes my heart jump. Hey Shanno! - Hallo, sir. Will you take this money to be my queen for one night? l'd rather give you money. What happened, wrestler? Rascal! - Wait, you witch! You tore a 100 rupees note? Let go of me, mother. I will tear his tummy if he doesn't call me sister. Where are you running? Rascal! Scoundrel! Now call me sister in front of this public. Or I'll send you to hell. Call her sister fast, or you'll have to call her granny. Forgive me, sister. I made a mistake. Not like that. Bow down at my feet. - Forgive me. - Run away! You silly girl! If you mess with every one, we will have to beg. They are our providers. - They might be yours. She's never traded her dignity, and she never will. Let all the public of the city understand that. Everyone has understood. Come now or the police will arrest us. - C'mon. You're out of your senses, Raja. You gave me a trunk call to come.. ..all way long and see this circus? You're dreaming to.. ..present this illiterate, harsh girl as princess Ratna? Cheers! - You're forgetting, Raja, that when Ratna was.. ..8 years old, she spoke English better than European kids. This girl will also speak, Mr. Diwan. And will speak the same way princess Ratna used to speak. Can a crow become a swan? At that young age, that girl was so polite, cultured and lovely. ..that every day people did rites to cast off evil eyes. Mr. Diwan, this girl will also show etiquette. Leave that to me. Just think if Ratna had been alive today.. ..would her face, complexion, eyes look like this girl's or not? Think till tomorrow. If you find it ok, just call me up. I'll come over. Bye. Just answer this before you leave. Are you trying to gain the wealth of Taragadh.. ..through that girl or are you planning.. ..to get us into jail for life? Don't insult me, Mr. Diwan. My name is Raja. And when Raja takes on a task, it finishes before it starts. Go to that kingdom relaxed. And when I'll convince this girl and make her princess Ratna.. ..I will talk business to you. It is impossible to make this wild animal a human. Nothing is impossible. When you and me could turn humans from monkeys.. ..it is no big deal turning this lovely animal to a princess. I am crazy after you! Now eat something from my hands. No, not like that. Live long! May you live a thousand years! Shanno darling, from today onwards.. ..my bungalow, this empire, cars and servants are all yours. From today you are my queen.. and I.. I am your slave. Mother! Get up, mother. It's time to leave from here. Let's go home. - Sit down! We are not unfamiliar to him. Let him jest with you for some time. Go and sit beside him. But mother, he's talking of his bungalow and empire. Sir, go to bed now. You'll feet completely ok when you wake up next morning. Sweetheart.. if you're here.. how can I feel sleepy? If you come along, I can feel sleepy. Come with me. Back off, you dog! Sister, send her to my room fast. I am losing this intoxication. Bastard! You have the guts to hit sir who owns a bungalow? I will break your legs.. - Shame on you, mother! That rascal was trying to harass your daughter.. ..in front of your eyes and you kept watching? Of course she would! Your mother has taken 300 rupees from him. Mother?! Being a mother you traded your daughter's honor? Your motherly love has died for mere 300 rupees? Don't talk rubbish to me. Go in the room. And serve the sir all night. Come on. No, I will not do what you want. Let go of me. Father! Father, save Shanno. - Leave your father. Go in. Shanno may die, but she will not sell her dignity. C'mon! Go in. - Where will you run? Go inside. Now that's better! My darling, come into my arms. You've wounded my heart enough. Sir.. sir.. Shanno is a very decent girl. Have mercy on her. Yes, I will show mercy. First hug me. Shanno, this distance is not good now. Sir, you are very rich. God has given you a lot. But Shanno is very poor. She has nothing except her honor. If her dignity is robed, her life will be ruined. So what if your life is ruined once? I will get you a life thousand times better than this one. First quench this thirst of my heart and relieve it. If you wish so, that's fine. But at least let me fit my blouse properly. - Yes. Now that's sense. What is all this? - I will show you right now. Dog! What are you doing? You witch! Tried to act smart, eh? - Leave me. Come and hug me. - Let me go! Mr. Raja, that girl is very smart. See, she injured me. If this wound had been two inches this side, I would have died. Come inside. Why do you want to die? We will die for you. Come in. Why are you scared? Come in. Thank you very much, brother. - Who are you calling brother? You. Back off! She's my share. You back off, too. You rascal! Shanno can deal with both of you. If you try to play pranks on me, I will tear off your belly. Put away that dagger. We are not poor: we have much money. Here, take this as a token. - Give that to mother and sister. Move back! Take the knife from her. Let go of me. Don't try to be smart. My dear. Here, take this. Take that, too. Rascal! You bastard! Come out here. - May Lord always protect you, sir! You saved the honor of a girl today. But how did you get into the hands of these wicked people? I was hanging outside the train. Seeing me alone they tried to harass me. Don't, sir. What do you do with such a dangerous knife? Nothing: Shanno cuts vegetables and fruits with that. Shanno? Who's Shanno? - Me. The one standing opposite you. That's my name. Hey! There's blood on this knife. How come? Blood? No, sir, it is not blood. It is tomatoes. Shanno had cut and eaten tomatoes last night. Really? She's eaten tomatoes? - Yes. - Ok, sit here. But where is Shanno going after eating tomatoes? She.. where does this train go? - To Mumbai. Mumbai? Shanno also wants to go to Mumbai. Really? To meet whom? Shanno has some relatives on her father's side. To meet them. Where do they live? Well.. I don't know their address. If you don't know the address.. ..where will you go at 2 o'clock in the night? Will this train reach there at 2 o'clock in the night? Yes, it reaches at 2:15. Do this. If you wish, you can stay at my place till morning. At your house? - Yes, if you like it. And if you wish to. I neither like it.. nor wish to. But.. Why do you want to kill me? Who.. who are you? - Your granny! Open the door or I'll cut you into pieces. Imartilal, open the door. Stay out, sir. I am fighting death in here. She's not death. She's come with me. Death.. come with you? Open the door. What's this? Don't be scared, Shanno. He's my servant, Imartilal. Whether he's Imartilal or Jalebilal.. ..why was he locking Shanno inside? Rascal! Don't say bad words. He was sleepy. How would he know who you are or where you came from? Come in. Shanno, you shouldn't feel bad. Actually, Imartilal is my butler, cook, servant and master. He had been playing the role of Laila in dramas for 9 years. These days he's playing the role of Majnu and I am his Laila. But I don't understand who this trouble is. Imartilal, she is not a trouble: her name is Shanno. What you need to understand is, get us the meal fast. We are very hungry. And Shanno.. you go to bed quickly after having the meal. So will this guest also sleep over? - Do you mind it? If the guest does not mind that, why would I? I was asking so that I can make arrangements. Shall I take a bed outside the door? Imartilal, you know very well that.. ..a guest is considered like God in my house. She'll sleep in the bedroom, not outside. Badru?! - No, the bedroom. A place where guests sleep. Come, I'll show you. Come. This is a special room for the guests to sleep in. You can sleep peacefully over here. - Alone? Where are the wives of you men? There are only men in this house: no women. If you're scared, you can lock the door from inside. Come and have the meal. Come and have the meal. - Yes. Shanno, open the door and have the meal. You men can eat the meal. Shanno is not hungry. What are you doing? - How can we trust her? She might steal a few things and vanish in the morning. Ok, go and eat the meal. Your mother has taken 300 rupees from him. Being a mother you traded your daughter's honor? Your motherly love has died for mere 300 rupees? Don't talk rubbish to me. Go in the room. And serve the sir all night. Come on. No, I will not do what you want. Let go of me. Hey! You haven't gone to bed yet? How will you? You've kept all the doors open. If this noise goes on all night, you won't be able to sleep. Why are you scared? You don't need to be afraid in this house. Close this door from the inside and go to sleep. Eat, my dear. Don't feel shy. Consider it your matrimonial feast and eat everything. Go away from here before sir wakes up. Leave fast. Is Shanno eating with your money? You are a servant: don't argue with me. Only sir, who has offered me food, can order me. Get me some strong tea. Hey! Why did you serve the poor girl on the floor? The table wasn't big enough to contain all these items. She's already eaten much. Look, Imartilal, we shouldn't comment when someone is eating. She didn't eat anything last night out of fear. Wouldn't you let her eat now? Do you want anything else, Shanno? - No. Shanno has had a very good meal. Ok, get ready: I'll drop you. Where do your relatives live? Shall Shanno tell you the truth? So, were you lying last night? - Yes, that was a big lie. Shanno has no relatives in this world. You must be having someone. You must have come from somewhere. And you will go somewhere. Don't be afraid: tell me the truth. First.. make this mad man go away. Why feel shy of him? He is a family man. Imartilal, it is really sad.. This poor girl has no one in the heaven either! Go and make tea for me. Yes, Shanno, tell me. Sir, Shanno is from a very decent family. Yes, that's obvious! And besides that, Shanno is very pretty. - Really? Can't you see that? It was very dark at night. I couldn't see properly. What happened then? Sir, an old, bad man fell in love with Shanno. Very badly. Really? Very badly? - Yes. He didn't have hair on his head, or teeth in his mouth.. ..and no bones in his body. And you know how old Shanno is, sir. Only this much! That rascal was really cunning. He paid 500 rupees twice to Shanno's.. ..aunt's aunt and fixed marriage with Shanno forcibly. That's really bad. Now Shanno was trapped. What would she do? So Shanno ran away from her home. But Shanno is very lucky that she found you, sir. Tell me, sir, where will Shanno go now? Directly to the police station! Your problem with that old man and aunt will be solved there. Why are you interfering between two decent persons? You rascal! - Please, keep quiet. Shanno, your story is really very sad. But unfortunately l cannot keep you here. You will have to go somewhere. I had given you shelter for one night only. Will it be a sin to give shelter for two nights? It might be. Ok, don't give me shelter. At least give Shanno a few days time to think over. Ok, you can think over in a few days. But before that you think over, sir. I have thought over, Imartilal. Shanno will stay here for another 3 - 4 days. Listen: I am going out on business. Get her to bathe properly, with some gel. Yes, soap won't work on her. Listen, sir. If you're going out, please take me with you. Or take the dagger she has with you. Imartilal, blow out this cigarette. Cigarette? I will blow out this cigarette. Sir is an awfully decent man. Who are you? Man or woman? Can't you see that in this day light? You stupid man! I am Shanno. Why did you touch sir's clothes? Take them off. Take them off or I will.. Dog! You will make Shanno take off the clothes? My dear granny, I did not mean what you're saying. I was saying that for your benefit. What business does sir do? - First put away that Rampuri dagger. My heart beats loud with fear. - First tell me. What would I say? Sir business is to order me. Sir's father used to order my father. And sir's grandfather used to order my grandfather. Now sir's kid will order my kids. Silly man, will the kids fall down from the ceiling? Where is the wife of sir? - Are you some detective? I've been answering all your questions. Now you tell me. What is going on between you and sir? Imarti! - I'm in trouble! What is going on? - Well.. she.. well.. that.. He was asking me what is going on between me and you. Ran away out of fear! Silly man! Look, I've brought some clothes for you. - For me? Yes, change these ones and put on the ones you like. Listen! Don't use bad words in this house. Which rascal is using bad words? That silly man has brought the clothes of men. Might have brought for himself. Rascal! Shanno, don't use bad words. Rascal is a bad word. May Lord Hanuman save from obstacles! May he save me from you for two more days! Brother Imarti, listen to me. I am not your brother! I am the only child of my parents. What a man you are! You feel bad about a girl's words? If I like you, what would I call you? Uncle? Why do you bother to call me? Steal some more goods of sir in the next two days. And then be off. Move aside! I want to cut potatoes. Listen to this wonderful thought! You are a devotee of Hanuman: I am his devotee, too. We will have a good bond. Give me five. Ok, I'll cut the potatoes for you on that note. You will neither cut potatoes or my cards. l understand very well your tricks. Get out of here. C'mon. And never step in the kitchen again. Go, man! Shanno does not need to come in your kitchen. Shanno has got a nice mansion to live in. Imarti! Imarti! Order me, sir. Shanno is at your service. Where is Imarti? - To hell with that rascal! He's an idler. It's so late. And he's cut only four potatoes since morning. Really? - Yes. You don't know, sir.. ..he also steals and eats food while cooking it. And offers his half eaten food to you. - Really? Yes, just order me, sir. Shanno will cook very good food for you every day. Will you move over there? - Yes, sure. But where? Where? Here. Close your eyes. - Look, don't play some prank with Shanno. Close your eyes. And think where you will go after two days. That rascal does not care a damn for Shanno. Shanno will still not go anywhere. She will stay here. Sir Imarti! - Sir? Bajarangabali, she's calling Imarti sir. Protect me! Tell me, Your Highness. What's the matter? Why do your words sound so sweet today? This is terrible! Is this justice? There's a woman in the house, and yet a man has to cook? This is very embarrassing for Shanno. Move aside.. What are you doing? You're a guest here for a night. Let me serve you. You will be leaving next morning. Then we won't be meeting again. Is that so? Shanno will not leave then. Shanno will cook Dal, Bati and Churma here from today. You both can eat peacefully. That's fine, my granny. But sir will get you out of this place tomorrow morning. That's the problem. Sir! Please, think of some solution. I am very good at finding solutions. But why would I tell a stupid girl like you? If it had been some pretty, fashionable girl in your place.. You rascal! Drama man! You don't know that.. ..public in Pune used to call me Chhappan Chhuri. People used to fight with knives for Shanno. That's the problem. You use daggers in every matter. In such situations one shouldn't use daggers.. ..but the arrows of one's sharp eyes. Go, man! You're silly! Shanno would have found a solution long back. But she's held back by her decency. By the way, what you're saying is right. If I want to stay in this house, I will have to put up a show. The fun starts now! Bajarangabali, forgive me. You didn't show some miracle to get rid of that trouble. So I had to do that miracle. Sir will cut her braid tonight and will throw her out. And next morning I will offer you Jalebis made from pure ghee. Ok, I'll be off now. I've booked a ticket for the last show. Imarti! Imarti! Who is it? Shanno? Shanno! Shanno! Why are you sleeping here? Shanno! Hey Shanno! I see. So that's the matter? 'Come, come, come.' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'Why does the king keep a distance from his queen?' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'The desires have stretched themselves.' 'The guests in my heart have robbed my heart.' 'The desires have stretched themselves.' 'The guests in my heart have robbed my heart.' 'Don't trade your heart for mine. At least look into my eyes.' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'I will be lost in a land of dreams.' 'Come, sweetheart. Or I will fall asleep.' 'I will be lost in a land of dreams.' 'Come, sweetheart. Or I will fall asleep.' 'Come and settle in my eyes before the dreams come.' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'Why does the king keep a distance from his queen?' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'Come, come, come. Say something. Listen something.' 'Say something. Listen something.' Wow! Very good, Shanno. You sing really well. Salaam, sir. Thank you. You sing really well in Hindi. Why didn't you sing before? Well, Shanno sings English songs very well, too. Just order me. From tomorrow I will sing one song in the morning.. ..and one song in the evening every day. From tomorrow? - Yes. But you are to leave tomorrow, Shanno. Am I to leave? Rascal! Silly! - What did you say? You have such a nice, big mansion. Is Shanno going to rob it? I will clean up your house every day. Clean it up? - Yes. Shanno is to go to jail and be hanged now. Hanged? Is this justice? What sin has Shanno committed? What sin have you committed? Haven't you stabbed a man with knife and run away? l thought you were a poor girl and gave you shelter in my house. But you're still cheating me. After running away from your parents.. ..you say you don't have anyone in this world? Don't mention my parents' names to me. Shanno will die, but not go back to them. I don't want to see their face. - Why wouldn't you see their face? You don't know, sir. My mother sold my dignity to a sinner for mere 300 rupees. Shanno danced in the streets and.. ..earned them 20 - 30 rupees everyday. Why did they sell Shanno honor then? Can someone's honor be priced? If Shanno hadn't hit that rascal with knife.. ..he would have injured Shanno's honor. Now you be the judge and decide. If you order, Shanno will give her life. Shanno is not afraid to die. She only fears to be hanged. A person's neck stretches long and drops like that. How would I believe a liar? I swear on Lord Hanuman. What's this? Why do you drag Lord between us? Poor Lord Hanuman! Don't cry: I know that you're innocent. But what do I do about the police? How do I explain them? Yes, I can save you from being hanged. But you will have to live like a princess. And this name of yours.. Shanno.. won't do. Your name will be.. Ratna from today. I will change your way of talking, walking and lifestyle. Then even your parents won't be able to recognize you. And people.. people will call you a princess and salute you. So, are you ready? Shanno is ready to be.. ..any one's granny to save herself from hanging. Ok, fine. Be off to your room and go to sleep. What did you say Shanno's name would be? Ratna! Ratna! Ratna! Ratna? Hey! What's this? My plan is flopped? Bajarangabali, you wasted my Jalebis. Good morning, Ms. Ratna. Tea is ready, princess. What is Shanno supposed to say? - My head! What is your name? Don't you recall what your name is? Ratna. - Ratna. Listen: now order your servant to present you a cup of tea. Hey Imartilal! Sir, what is this drama? Imartilal, behave yourself in the presence of Ms. Ratna. Shut up! Get me some Sindhi tea. Strong. Ms. Ratna, neither strong, nor Sindhi nor Beda. Now you are a girl of a rich family. So say it proudly. Boy! Get me a cup of tea. Tea.. get me a cup of boy. - Oh no! Say it straight. Boy, get me a cup of tea. Boy, get me a cup of tea. - Bravo! Very English! Now drink this tea with such style and pride as though.. ..you were doing a favor to me, Imrati and the whole lndia. I know how to drink tea. What is this? This noise won't do. It is a special trade mark of poverty. Pouring in saucer, directly in tummy, and fast to work. Why do you need to hurry? You are a rich girl. Drink it leisurely. Ratna is rich, but how can she drink such hot tea from the cup? Tell the servant then.. boy, cool it for me. Boy, cool it a little for me. - Not little. Say a bit. A bit. - Little. - A bit. - Little. - A bit. A bit.. bit.. a little - A bit.. Sir, a bit. - That's what I am saying. A bit, sir. - Get out! Boy, get me some water. As you order, princess. Get me a bit cold water. A bit? - Good. Now start eating. Knife in this hand: fork in this hand. Sir, keep her away from knives and forks. - Shut up, lmrati. How do I use the knife? - Look at me. Press with the fork, and cut with the knife. Now pick up with fork and eat it. Doesn't matter. I'll show you. Look.. use your hands lightly. Hold the knife slanted. Press the food with fork. And now cut with knife slowly. And then eat. What nice smell! - Yes, some Kashmiri saffron is added to that. Not from the hen: from your body! Fooling him very well. The girl's hand should be here. The other hand here. And like that. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. What happened? Why are you laughing? I feel ticklish. Be serious. Write A. - A. This is A. Now write B. - B Is this B? My foot! Looks like railway signal! This is B. Write C. - C. Fine. Write D. - D. Is this D? You've written it wrong way. 'Forget ABCD. Look into my eyes.' 'Look, don't break my heart.'

Look into my eyes.' 'Look, don't break my heart.' 'It is a beautiful evening, Raja dear, Raja dear.' 'Raja, Raja, Raja, dear.' Take this slap as.. ..an auspicious moment and go from here. Sir hits really hard. I've already been hit with 12 dozen shoes. You won't be able to bear all that. So if you wish your well being, go away from here soon. You are mad, Imarti! You don't know that sir considers Shanno as his wife. Consider you his wife? Yes, if he didn't take me as his wife, why would he slap me? Good morning, sir. You will get this juice every morning now. What are you doing here? Imarti! - I've sent him to the market to get vegetables. Give me the bottle. - No, I won't. You've acted as you wished. Because there was no woman to handle this house earlier. Now you will have to do what I say. Got it? And I won't be scared of anyone now. Lord, you won't be having a more foolish devotee than me. I unnecessarily tried to get rid of that poor Shanno. Shanno, who turned this hotel to home and sir to a human. We don't have much time. Shanno is waiting at the dining room. So let's talk business now. - We've already talked over it. You will be getting 30% share, and I 70%. Cheers! - Wait a minute! - What happened? Mr. Diwan, looks like you're memory.. ..is getting washed with growing age. It was decided that we'll make a deal when.. ..I'll turn Shanno to princess Ratna. And now the matter is that we will have a 50 - 50 share. If you agree to that, join hands. Otherwise here's the ticket for your flight. Reach the airport at 3 o'clock. But have you explained that girl what she is supposed to do? Is she ready? Your task is to join hands with me. It is my task to tell her and convince her. Ok, partner. The deal is closed. We are partners. 50 - 50. Where have you brought me? Who are these pictures of? Strange! You've forgotten your family? Do you know her? Or have you forgotten her, too? This is your childhood picture. You seem to be in a mood to jest with me today. This is not some joke, Ratna. This is the last lesson, which you will have to learn by heart. Because after that will be your exam. If you pass that test.. ..you will have plenty of wealth at your feet. And if by chance you fail that test, both of us will have to.. ..go jail. You will be in women's cell, and I in men's ward. Now stop this fun. Your joke is scaring me. Stop being scared and listen to me carefully. She is Ratna, the heiress of Taragadh empire. When she was 7 years old, she was going to.. ..Prayag Raj by car with her father, Himmat Singh.. ..and her mother, Madam Kesar. When they were passing by the dense jungle.. ..the family enemy of the king, Tejasingh.. ..attacked them and killed the king and queen. He carried the princess and tried to run away on a horse. At that time, a loyal servant of the king.. ..Juman Khan, fired at Tejasingh. Tejasingh was injured, but he escaped. But in that commotion.. ..princess Ratna fell from his hands in the sea and died. But because Ratna's dead body was not found.. ..Rajmata still feels that her grand daughter is alive.. ..and will come back some day or the other. So you will have to remember even the smallest points.. ..of the princess' childhood. And will have to keep in mind each place and person.. ..which might have been related to princess Ratna's life. I don't understand what you mean. I mean that if princess Ratna was alive today.. ..she would look exactly like you. So now you are to go to Rajmata and prove to her.. ..that you are her lost grand daughter, Ratna. What? No, no, Raja, I won't be able to do this. No, I can't do this. Use your brains before talking, Shanno. Raja is not used to hearing 'No'. So all that sympathy, that love you had for me.. ..was only a deception to force me to do this fraud? It is you who are deceiving me. While indulging in the luxuries offered by money.. ..did you ever think for once where that money came from? And now when you have a chance to earn money.. ..you consider it fraud? I say, what did you think while enjoying.. ..all this luxury in a stranger's house for free? I have done a mistake, Raja. I was deceived. l thought you also loved me. Love? Don't even speak this unlucky word in front of me again. I've been cheated badly.. ..in the name of decency, sympathy and love. These are traps with which a clever hunter hunts his prey. Enough, Raja! For God's sake, stop it. I didn't know I was being prepared to be.. ..sacrificed for wealth in the name of love. I will beg to feed myself.. ..but I will never do such a sinful job. Ok, go back to that honorable world of yours.. ..where your parents had sold your dignity for 300 rupees. Where one day you will have to sell.. ..your youth for peanuts to earn a living. And one day you won't get a buyer either. Listen! This is Raja's house. Take whatever you want and go away. I had come empty handed: I will go empty handed. Are you leaving? Go, but answer my question first. Had you come here to marry sir or extort money from him? Don't hurt me more, Imarti. You don't know what sir has told me. I've heard every thing. I thought you will do what I have been unable to do all my life. You might bring sir on the right path. But you don't love sir as much as he loves money. You haven't understood your sir, Imarti. He's not a human: he is.. - He is a deity. Yes, one wouldn't find an angel like him on this earth. He is a king who has allowed the poor to rule. He's helped so many people. He's bore darkness in his own house.. ..and lighted other people's houses. So what's wrong with your sir now? Nothing's wrong with him: it is the Almighty who is asleep. This world punished my sir for his humanity and decency.. ..and made him beg for a penny. The person whom sir had given thousands of rupees earlier.. ..didn't help him a bit when sir's mother fell ill. The world wounded sir's heart for money.. ..but sir kept smiling for every injury. He used to forget his sorrows in the company of a girl he loved. But when that girl, too, abandoned sir for money.. ..sir's heart was broken. Raja?! How dare you enter? You are also my childhood friend, Mr. Lakhpat. Have you forgotten me? - Lakhpat, throw him out. How did you dare to come in without permission? Out! Get out! Get out! I will send you to jail. You had the guts to insult Lakhpat in my house? Don't be tensed. Your dear Lakhpat became a millionaire on my support. Talk about yourself. - I don't want to talk to you. But understand this well. I won't let you ruin the happiness of my life. My dear, I was the happiness of your life some day. The joy of your life lay at my feet some day. But I never knew you would be so foolish.. ..to squander all your wealth and become a beggar. So what if I don't have wealth any more? These hands.. these arms are the same.. ..in which you desired to spend all your life. Come. These hands are still ready to hug you. Come on. Stay away! I was crazy then. And now you are crazy that you still dream of me. I am not dreaming of you. Rather, I've woken from dreams.. ..and am seeing your real self. Go.. go.. I free you today. You've opened my eyes. You've shown me that money is the greatest power on earth. Money.. and only money! But how shall this passion for money be wiped from sir's mind? My dear, a woman who loves whole heartedly.. ..can make his man forget even the prostitutes. Can't you make sir forget his obsession for money? You are right, Imarti. I was off the path of my duty. Have faith in me. Till I get off this obsession of money from sir's mind.. ..and make him fall in love with me, I will follow his orders. I will fulfill all his wishes. Be seated. Sit down. Rajmata is calling you. Only you, sir. - Please, sit down, princess. C'mon. Please, go with her. Oh! Welcome. Is your name Rajkumar (prince)? Yes, that's my name, but I'm not a real prince. Who are you? - I am the minister of this kingdom. I received your letter. And read it out to Rajmata. She wants to ask you a few points. You didn't write anything about yourself in the letter. Who are you? Where do you live? You might have heard about king Ramsingh of Jidhongir. Yes, I recall it. Ramsingh had a small empire, but his fame was wide spread. I am his son, Rajkumar Singh. I own a business in Mumbai. And the girl, who you think is princess Ratna.. ..where did you meet her? With your family enemy, goon Tejasingh. That sinner is still alive? No more, Rajmata. On the 3rd of this month of Phagun.. ..at 2 o'clock in the night.. ..he got freedom from his criminal life. I see. But dealing in Mumbai.. ..how did you reach the valley of Chambal? Perhaps you don't know, Mr. Diwan, but Rajmata knows it well. That my father and Tejasingh were close friends. If Tejasingh was alive, why did he let princess Ratna live? He had vowed to ruin Taragadh. I find your story a bit unreal. I haven't come here to take favor from you, Mr. Diwan. Rather, I've come to do a favor to you out of humanity. So watch your words. - You mind your language! Mr. Diwan! You still haven't answered my question. If this girl was in the custody of Tejasingh.. ..how come she's alive? Tejasingh was not a professional goon. He had a big empire of his own. Forgive me for being rude, Rajmata. Your son, Himmat Singh, had taken over his kingdom. After revenging for that, when he realized his sin.. ..he looked after princess Ratna just like his daughter. He arranged for her education in the valley of Chambal. And when he was about to die.. ..his caring for the princess did not let him die. Perhaps he thought of me then. When I reached him, he was dying. Before dying he handed me this responsibility.. ..of getting the princess to you. Where is that girl? - In the room outside, waiting to hug you. If you allow, shall I present her? No! No, we've deceived many a times. I need some time to think over. You will have to wait till I decide something. You will stay here as the royal guest. Please, let me know your decision at the soonest. Mr. Diwan, forgive me if I've made some mistake. Mr. Diwan, once again there is turbulence in my heart and mind. I don't know what to do. I am in the same state, Rajmata. My mind says that this is impossible. But my heart says, what if she is really princess Ratna? Mr. Diwan, I think we should gather the people.. ..who had seen Ratna in her childhood and were close to her. You, Dr. Nigam, the royal priest, Juman Khan.. ..tell every one to look at that girl closely. And then decide on it. After every one decides, l will declare my decision. Welcome! Mr. Diwan, what impolite people have you gathered here? They don't even stand up to greet princess Ratna! Please, sit down. - Thank you, Highness. Mr. Diwan, Rajmata doubts my being Ratna. So she won't come down to meet me. But I am sure I am her grand daughter. So present these flowers to her on my behalf. Padmini, take these flowers to Rajmata. Good morning, every body. - Good morning. You can freely ask me whatever questions you want to ask. l can pass through any test to see a glimpse of my granny. Hey! Juman Khan! You? Why are you standing there? Forgive me: I didn't see you. I am alive today because of you. I remember the whole incident. How you tried to save my late father! Didn't you recognize me either? How can that be, princess? Your picture is carved in my eyes. Juman Khan, sit down. Child! Can I ask you a question? Guruji, I won't mind it at all. So, my question is.. But.. before that you will have to answer my question. Don't you remember that you used to.. ..call me Rutva when I was a kid, and not child? I remember that. Priest, if you don't want to call me with my pet name.. ..call me with my real name. All right. So, Ms. Ratna, you might recall that.. ..once your clothes were on fire with the temple lamp. That wasn't an accident. The fire was stirred up due to the pranks of Pratap. My leg was burnt. And Dr. Nigam had given me some injection. So, Dr. Nigam, do you recall it? - Yes, yes. But what surprises me is that.. ..how do you remember your childhood incidents so well. Because I had nothing except these memories to live on. My memory of my childhood was so alive.. ..that every one used to get amazed. You can ask the tales of my memory.. ..to my English teacher, Mr. Wilson. Right, Mr. Wilson? How do you do? - How do you do? I am very happy to meet you once again. - Thank you. I never expected you would recognize an old man like me. Why not? I'm impressed by you. You've learnt every lesson by heart. To the extent that you didn't forget to remember me. How can I forget you? You are that Mr. Pratap whom I used to call.. ..'Pattu' out of love and 'Diwan's boy' out of anger. And when you used to call me Ratna instead of princess.. ..you were scolded. Once your father, Mr. Diwan, had also slapped you. Right, Mr. Diwan? These are matters which every one in this palace knows. Tell me which was that wild animal.. ..in the kingdom you were not allowed to go near. Father stopped me from coming near you only! Princess, that was the mad elephant.. ..Mangal, in the royal palace. It is still alive, and all of them know him. You couldn't pass a day without seeing him. For that your father appointed special servants who would.. ..keep an eye on you and wouldn't let you go near him. So, father.. isn't that true? - Very true. This.. this one I don't recall. Ok, you must recollect where that dates tree is.. ..from which we used to eat the dates secretly. From which well did we used to catch frogs? I told you.. ..I don't remember such trifle incidents of childhood. Oh! But people used to be amazed at your memory. Ask Mr. Wilson about the tales of your memory. Shall I tell you why you don't remember these small points? Because you are not princess Ratna, but some imposter. You want to play with the emotions of Rajmata.. ..and seize the wealth of this kingdom. This is false! I am not greedy of wealth. I don't care a damn for this empire. What are you waiting for? Just kick it off and get out of here. I won't go. I will not go without meeting my granny. Never! Never! Hey girl! What is this drama you're playing? Granny! - Don't call me that. Mr. Diwan, she might be a fraud.. ..but she's come as a portrayal of my Ratna. Give her in the name of Ratna whatever she wants. What do you want? That's it! I've got what l wanted. I wanted to see you once. Now let me touch your feet. - Don't you dare touch me! Back off! Mr. Diwan, offer her some charity in the name of Ratna.. ..and show her the way out of the empire. Keep your empire and prize to yourself. And here's the payment of your hospitality. Distribute whatever remains from that to your servants. Rajkumar! - Rajmata, all of them are cheaters. They want to prove the princess false.. ..as they want to rob your kingdom. But remember this. You will cry on your bad luck one day. C'mon, princess. Wait, Rajkumar. What is happening to you? - Nothing. Why are you coughing so badly? You were ok a few minutes back. Don't worry. When I feel overwhelmed.. I start coughing. How long have you had this ailment? Yes? Since childhood. Rajmata! Doctor, it's been so many days. Why isn't this cough cured? She has an unusual allergy, called psycho cough. It gets cured on its own with growing age. Ratna! Granny! - Ratna! My dear Ratna. My child. Hail princess Ratna! Hail princess Ratna! Praise princess Ratna! Praise princess Ratna! Praise princess Ratna! May princess live long! May princess live long! Hey! She seems to be our Shanno. Speak softly! If someone hears that, we'll be killed. You've gone mad. I tell you she is Shanno. Don't forget the duty of your love in this palace, Shanno. What were you talking to yourself? You haven't got over the habit of following someone secretly. I cannot get over the things I love. No matter if it's a bad childhood habit. Seeing their love today, I recall their childhood. Do you recall it? - Yes. Perhaps you were going to meet Rajmata. No, I've come at your service after meeting her. Where is she? Is she praying in the temple? No, she's left worshipping goddesses.. ..and has started worshipping you. She's given an off to all cooks.. ..and is preparing the breakfast for you. I thought I would ask you about.. ..my punishment in the meanwhile. - Punishment? Yes, after waiting for you all my life.. ..my eyes couldn't recognize you. What is my punishment for that? The punishment for your eyes is that.. ..they should never look at me. Have a bit of a mercy on me. Change this punishment, and sentence me to death instead. How long will you chat? C'mon, the breakfast is getting cold. Come, Rajmata. - Called me Rajmata again? I won't talk to you. Pratap, tell her.. ..that I won't give her food. I will let you go hungry all day. - Ok, I will fast. To hell with fasting. C'mon. I've cooked all recipes myself. - Come. Come, child. You must be very hungry. We're late for the breakfast. Sit down. So much food? Are some guests coming over? Eat quietly whatever is presented. I have a bad headache. I entered the kitchen today after 12 years. And I find there isn't anything proper to cook. There was no food or vessels. As though the kitchen was robbed. I've managed with whatever was available. But I scolded the head cook badly. Don't worry: every thing will be ok by the afternoon. You, too, sit down. Here. Your Highness, Mr. Rajkumar seeks your permission to meet you. He's come at the right time. Go and call him in. Why are you looking at me? Never make him wait. Whenever he comes, bring him straight to me. Don't know what purpose he's come here for. I think he must have come to ask your permission to go back. Who can dare to go from here so soon? My dear child hasn't got the official recognition yet. Hallo, Pratap. - Welcome, Rajkumar. Greetings, Rajmata. - Live long, my child. Live long. Listen: a guest can arrive at his own wish.. ..but can leave only when the host wishes. Rajmata, I've just packed my bags. But I've so much work with you. I want to talk to you. Sit down and have breakfast. Rajmata, you are elder: l cannot refuse you. But I had breakfast just now. Please, be seated. Fasting today for what? - Sit down first: I'll tell you. Today not only my fasting day has started. A new fasting year has started. When my dear child was lost.. ..and enemies said bad things about that, I had vowed that.. ..the day she is found, I will start fasting for a year. Hey! Why aren't you eating anything? Here, take this 'Navaratna Paratha'. You haven't even tasted this milk sweet. Have it. How shall I eat all this? - I'll tell you how. Rajratan, where is the royal sweetmeat of milk fat? It's getting ready, Your Highness. Still getting ready? If my child goes without eating it, it will be useless. This lethargy won't do. Find yourself a new job. Let me also see the preparations. Child, be seated. I'll be right back. You've given a new life to Rajmata. This is.. the kindness of Mr. Rajkumar. You are right. To tell you the truth, if we give away this entire empire.. ..to you for what you've done, it won't be enough. Think before you say anything, Mr. Pratap. It is said that the deities sometimes.. ..fulfill the wishes said as a joke. No, Rajkumar.. Why do you bother, princess? I am not joking, Mr. Rajkumar. I am telling the truth. This kingdom cannot repay your favor. With Rajmata.. Pay less attention to food and drinking. Concentrate on your real task. Win over Rajmata's trust.. ..and gain the keys to royal treasury from her. Win over Rajmata's trust.. ..and gain the keys to royal treasury from her. Win over Rajmata's trust.. ..and gain the keys to royal treasury from her. You? What are you doing? Watching you to my heart's content. What else? Go to sleep. - But I had put you to bed.. Don't worry about my sleep. l sleep very little. When you were not here, I couldn't sleep as I was anxious. Now that you've come, l can't sleep out of joy. And I am a bit scared of sleep. If I never wake up, how will I see you happy? Once I get you married, I will sleep soundly for good. I will never wake up then. - Rajmata! What? You called me Rajmata again? Let go of me. I won't talk to you. Leave me. If you lose courage half way.. ..how will you reach your destination? You have a long way to go yet. He will never change, Imarti. I've done a big mistake. Get this point. Crying like this won't work. You will have to show some miracle. I mean you will have to make him feel jealous. Only then you can move ahead. I won't go out of your way till you decide my fate today. Get this point. Crying like this won't work. You will have to show some miracle. I mean you will have to make him feel jealous. Only then you can move ahead. Our fates were decided the same day.. ..l returned here after 12 years. And you thought me to be some imposter. That means your love is false and pretentious. It was my true love, Ratna, that I couldn't recognize you. Your childhood picture was so carved in my heart.. ..that I couldn't recognize this new, youthful picture of yours. And I had come here with this faith that.. ..the whole world might not recognize me.. ..but my Pratap will be overjoyed to see me. He will come running and will hug me. Truly, Ratna? Were you eager to see me after a separation of 12 years? Yes, you think I've come here.. ..to gain this empire of stone and cement? This palace is like graveyard for those who lose their love. Enough, Ratna! Or my heart will tear apart. Ratna, allow me to hug you today.. ..and repent for all my mistakes. Forgive me, Ratna. What are you doing? Someone might see us. Sir, why have you called for the car? Shall I get you the meal fast if you're going somewhere? Put the meal in the car. I want to go to the water palace. Water palace? I will also come along. I will feed you on the way.. ..and will also pay respects to goddess. I've heard that some miracles still happen there. Yes, miracles happen. - Really? Get ready then. - Fine. Hallo. - This is Imarti speaking. - Imarti? Sir is going to water palace right now. Water palace? - I will signal you by playing the horn twice. This seems to be Pratap's car. What is he doing here? Must have come with some girl. - Really? Let us watch the fun. What happened? - Pressed by mistake. 'It's so much fun.' 'It's so much fun.' 'Our eyes are talking. Our desires are burning.' 'It's so much fun.' 'Our eyes are talking. Our desires are burning.' 'It's so much fun.' 'Earlier I had some complaints against you.' 'That's why I didn't meet you.' 'Earlier I had some complaints against you.' 'That's why I didn't meet you.' 'The season is changing. I am changing, too.' 'Our wishes are blossoming.' 'It's so much fun.' 'Our eyes are talking. Our desires are burning.' 'It's so much fun.' 'After settling in your eyes and on this path of love.' 'After settling in your eyes and on this path of love.' 'I sometimes balance, and sometimes fall down.' 'Our wishes are blossoming.' 'It's so much fun.' 'Our eyes are talking. Our desires are burning.' 'It's so much fun.' Congratulations, Rajmata. The government has granted permission.. ..to the princess to become the official heiress. Jagdamba! It's your mercy! Mr. Diwan, you've fulfilled your duty. Send the royal priest to me. And order all the officers of the palace.. ..to arrange for a celebration. I want to see such a celebration in this palace.. ..after seeing which God would show me his heaven. As you order, Rajmata. C'mon. Quick. This way. Very good. Good. Father! Forgive me, father. I want to tell you something important in privacy. Pratap, you've gone mad. How can I leave the preparations for celebration? Perhaps the news I've got will stop this celebration. Come. Will you tell me what the matter is? The matter is not to be told, but to be shown. Come on. What's going on here? Salaam, sir. - Salaam, sir. Who are these people? Ask them yourself. Tell him who you are. - Tell him: don't be afraid. Sir, we are no one. We are simple acrobats. We are your servants, sir. We are very grateful that you made our girl, Shanno.. ..a princess of the royal palace. Shanno? Princess? What rubbish are you talking? We've not come to take back Shanno, sir. We've come only to ask for your mercy. The matter is.. since our Shanno has gone away.. ..we've been in a bad state: we've become beggars. We are dying of hunger, sir. You mean the princess is your daughter, Shanno? - Yes, yes. Himmatsingh! Bahadursingh! Take away these mad people. - No, sir. Lock them in jail. - Have mercy, sir. We don't want any thing. We don't want anything from you. Who are these wicked people? Where did you get them at this sensitive occasion? Father, these wicked people.. ..are the real parents of the false princess. And to send them to jail without hearing their story.. ..can only mean that you, too, with Raja know very well.. ..that this princess is an imposter. Yes, father, I know every thing. But the involvement of Raja in your plan can be your weak point. It can ruin your plan any moment. When you know so much, mister, you might.. ..also be knowing that I am doing this for your welfare. But, father, this plan will work for my welfare.. ..only if you remove Raja out of my way for good. Ladies and Gentlemen, attention please. Please, be seated at your places. The auspicious moment has come when Rajmata.. ..with the government permission is going to.. ..coronate princess Ratna on the royal throne of Taragadh. And according to the years old tradition.. ..she will make princess the owner of the royal treasury.. ..and will hand her the treasure key herself. Here, child. It is your trust. Ladies and Gentlemen.. ..now Her Highness of Taragadh.. ..wants to announce an important order to you all. This is the moment for which I've been alive. I don't have the right words to express my joy. I only want to say that.. ..today I want to free myself from my last duty. I want to hand over the royal throne to your new princess.. ..and want to get her married. So I've fixed her marriage with Pratap, the son of Mr. Diwan. 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'The moment of doom has come.' 'My eyes are filled with tears of joy.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'The moment of doom has come.' 'My eyes are filled with tears of joy.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'Wait a bit. Won't you see this drama of mine?' 'Wait a bit. Won't you see this drama of mine?' 'Why do you turn away? Won't you see this scene?' 'Somewhere some hearts are broken.' 'Somewhere the clarinets are played.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'The moment of doom has come.' 'My eyes are filled with tears of joy.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'I won't say that it is you who broke the promise.' 'I won't say that it is you who broke the promise.' 'But o companion, the place where you left my company..' 'Is it a road or the destination? I couldn't get it.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'The moment of doom has come.' 'My eyes are filled with tears of joy.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' 'Congratulations to you for this day.' Can I come in? Today I've completed your orders. See this. Now you will surely allow me to come near you, won't you? I'm so silly! Why do I need anyone's permission now? I have really become princess Ratna now. I am the master of this kingdom, this palace and house. Oh yes! Here, take your trust. The key to the treasure. After teaching me manners and etiquette.. ..have you forgotten them yourself? When a lady enters, a man should stand up. Forgive me, princess. Today was such a joyful day.. ..I've drunk a bit too much. If I can come back to my senses.. ..I will stand up to welcome you. You are right. Such an auspicious day won't be back. I am not drunk, but I feel the whole world is dancing. But why did you leave the celebration and come here? You didn't even congratulate me for the wedding. Whatever I've got in this life is your mercy. You made a mere street dancer a damsel of heavens. See this. Diamonds and rubies worth 2.5 lakhs.. ..are studded only in my clothes! If I get a 100 lives again, I won't be.. ..able to repay your favors. I had come to bow to you and ask your permission to leave. I have a request. You won't go from here before getting me married. Promise me that. We will talk about promises later. First tell me who decided upon this marriage? Why should you care about that? Who else will care about your wedding if not me? Whatever you've got till now is my mercy. That old account of ours is settled now. I've got you the pleasures of life that you wanted from me. Here. Now I am the master of my wish. I love Pratap, and I am marrying him at my wish. I was also under that impression, but that is false. No, it is true. It is true. I love Pratap. Shanno, answer me straight. Who has attacked on my back? Say that Pratap and his father have cheated me. - Let go of me. Do not touch. Now I am nobody of yours. You have no right on me. I have no right. I have no right. Raja! Shanno. - Raja! Shanno, you are my life. You are some virtue of my past life.. ..who has come to improve this life of mine. Your love is the greatest wealth for me. Then leave this sinful world of money for Shanno. There can be no greater wealth than love. Raja, take Shanno to some place.. ..where we won't be separated. Raja, I will be choked here. Get me out.. ..of here today, right now. Yes, Shanno, but it is difficult for us to leave together. Do this. Get back to the palace. I will come to the backdoor of the palace by car. You come over there. - I am scared, Raja. Don't part me from you now. Hurry up, Shanno. Our fate is going to be decided in these few moments. Raja! Shanno, we are running short of time. Go quickly. What are you getting ready for, partner? What do you intend to do? My intentions are always dangerous, partner. That's why I always stay alert. See, I've come on the right time. Or I wouldn't have met you. But where are you planning to go at this late hour? I was just coming to meet you. To clear our accounts. That is a family matter. We can clear it any time. Today is a night of celebration. But I see you're a bit upset. I am always in a good mood. But you are really lucky. Mr. Diwan, you've really got a new life. So we will surely celebrate for your safety. - New life? And in this new life, I've become the father in law.. ..of Taragadh from its accountant. Right? It is a long matter, and I have very little time. Yet I will drink with you for the last time.. ..and explain you the matter. Partner, you know that.. ..in this world of honest people and money lenders.. ..honesty has remained only with thieves like us. So the consequence of dishonesty in our world is very bad. You are saying the same matter I had come to explain you. That means you have understood your end very well. The end of every human is death, partner. But my problem is that I will have stay alive now. I had been playing with the life of.. ..an innocent girl for my greed of money. I've lost my life to her love. Otherwise I had decided.. ..to kill you both cheaters tonight and surrender to law. Don't lose your senses like a gambler who has lost the game. Your plan has over turned. But I can still forgive you and provide you for life. That girl worth two pennies.. Dog! Don't insult the girl.. ..because of whose love you are alive till date. Now if you try and scream, I will kill you. Hands up! One shouldn't mess with a crocodile.. ..if one wants to live in water. I am a dog? My name is Diwan Gajendrasingh. You're still a child. Say cheers! C'mon, Raja. You've come? Come on. Come on. - Let go of me. You scoundrel! Let go. Come on. - Let go of me. You scoundrel! Let go. Come in, princess. I've got you here to let you meet your Raja. Look there. See? Mr. Diwan, forgive Raja. I am your criminal. Do not punish him. If you want to take life, take mine. Let him go. l beg of you. - No, no.. why do you embarrass me, princess? I am your servant. And Raja's life or death is in your hands now. In my hands? - Yes, if you want Raja to live, you will.. ..have to continue being the princess and marry Pratap. No, Shanno, don't ruin your life for me. Mansingh! No, no! Don't take Raja's life. I agree to all your conditions. I will kill these dogs. - Shut up! Stop blabbering or I will cut off your tongue. You, too, listen carefully. lf you say a word against me.. ..that word will become the order to Raja's death. Got it? No, child, no. Behave yourself. She is our princess. Princess, we don't have much time. Go back to the palace. It is necessary that you reach back before Rajmata wakes up. Come. Please, come. Who? - It's me. I've come to put the jug of water. Revered madam, I had not come to deceive you.. ..but rather to save you from deception. This cruel world had turned a human into a demon. But my heart considered him as my lord. He had come to rob your wealth.. ..by presenting me as your grandchild, Ratna. And I had come to fulfill my duty.. ..by bringing him back on the right path. Staying under the shadow of a goddess like you.. ..my wish is fulfilled. I am going back. Your sinful devotee, Shanno. Ratna! Ratna! What's the hurry, eh? No, no! Go to your room. Shanno, now is the moment of your true test. Now you are to save the life of your Raja.. ..and also protect the trust of that holy madam. Why are you so sad on such an auspicious day, child? Child, you don't look happy. You're surely hiding something from me. Look at me. Tell me what the matter is. Tell me frankly. You are under my oath. Granny, I think you've forgotten to give a prize.. ..to the one who's brought so much joy to the palace. But swear on me that you won't tell him my name. Or he'll feel bad. Don't worry about what I am to do or not to do. Tell me truly, are you happy with this marriage or not? If you lie, you will see me dead. Granny! Yes, Your Highness, tell us the truth. We've been serving your family for 7 generations now.. ..and we consider it our duty to give our life for your joy. Now convince Rajmata in front of me.. ..that you are happy with this marriage. Granny, I am happy. I am very happy. Mr. Diwan, where is Rajkumar? Haven't seen him for long. We will start the ceremony only after he comes. His presence is very important. Yes.. yes.. as you order. Himmatsingh! The princess and Rajmata are calling Mr. Rajkumar. Tell him to come in. Yes sir. Sir, Mr. Rajkumar is here. Greetings, Rajmata. - Come, Rajkumar. Why are you away from us in these moments of joy? We've received this happiness because of you, and you're away? Look, Mr. Diwan, don't let him go out of palace for a minute. Arrange for him to stay here. I have much work with him. As you order, Your Highness. Every one is eager for the ceremony. Please, come. Who? - It's me. Who me? Tell me the name. It's me, Raja. Your Shanno. Open the door. I don't understand how they freed you. I am unable to believe that it's really you standing here. What trick are they playing? Why don't you answer? Why don't you speak, Raja? No, no. You are not Raja. Who are you? Go straight back to your room, princess! Let go of me, you scoundrel. Don't try and play some game with Mr. Diwan. You don't yet know Mr. Diwan. He had prepared me even before he called Raja here. And remember this: I will be watching you.. ..all the time in the palace. Water! Water! Here, drink water. Let go of him. What have you done? Mr. Diwan had said that this man should.. ..remain alive till the princess got married. Open the door quickly. - Why would I let him die? Hey! Sir! Sir! Punno! Punno! Have courage, Punno. Have courage, Punno. Have courage, Punno. C'mon, let's go from here quickly. C'mon, Punno. Have courage. Hurry up. Wait! Stop! Kherati! I think I won't live now. This is the punishment of my sins. Go to Rajmata fast and inform her.. ..that Shanno is the real princess. What? So Shanno is not your daughter? No.. no.. that's what we tried to tell Diwan many times. Sir! Have mercy! We are telling the truth, sir. We haven't met anyone. We haven't told anything to any one. We swear on God. Yes, sir. That girl is not our daughter. She's not your daughter? - No. Then whose daughter is she? We've not been able to know that till date. That's why we've safely kept.. ..her childhood clothes and amulets till now. Here, sir. See this. - See this. This one. And.. here's the amulet. These clothes and amulet are of Ratna. When had you found her? 12 years back. We were going on some business at the Kumbha fair. We saw a girl being carried away in a river. So we saved her. Yes, she was unconscious. When she regained consciousness.. ..she could not recollect her name or address. We brought her up as our child. That's our only fault. And.. I've got this punishment instead of a prize. Punno! Punno! There they are. Imarti, you both get out of here through the jungle. I will handle them. This is Rajmata's room. Kamalsingh, I'll be back in a while. Look after Rajmata, and don't let anyone go in. Who are you? Raja, bless you. Rajmata has especially called me here to bless you. Rajmata told me that all this was possible because of you. Rajmata? Sage, what is your name? Child, do sages have names? But if you still want to know, my name is Raja. Who is it? - It's me, Lalsingh. Mr. Jalimsingh, open the door. There's some bad news. What happened? - A terrible thing has happened. lnform Mr. Diwan that Raja has escaped from the jail. Really? Go back to your place. I will inform him right now. - Ok. Terrible news, Mr. Diwan! Raja has escaped. He can enter the palace any time. How could he escape? Where were our guards, you rascal? You don't need to be tensed, father. Don't worry. The whole palace is in the custody of our guards. If he dares step in, he will call on his death. The princess and Rajmata are both locked in their rooms. Take out all the treasure from.. ..the royal treasury and take it over. Jalimsingh, I had ordered you.. ..not to leave Rajmata for a minute. Go there now! - Sir, it was necessary to inform you.. Go now! Father! Yes, there. That is the royal treasure! - Pratap, give the keys to me. Let me open the treasure doors myself. Let me fulfill this wish of my life. Ok, father, ok. You open the door. This is a bogus key. This girl is a cheater. - Cheater? - Yes. Where is the real key? - Tell us. Diwan! The real key is with me. That is not the key to the royal treasure. It is the key to disclose.. ..the dishonesty of the royal officers. l suspected that.. ..Ratna was trapped in the net of some traitors. But I never expected that those traitors.. ..would be you father and son. Ok, now that you've known the truth, give us the real keys. Stay away! Don't think I'll be scared of dogs like you. Beware! Come back to your senses, old woman! Your life or death is in our hands. If you care for your life, give me the key. Arrest these two traitors. Why are you looking at me? Didn't you hear what I ordered? Oldie, do you now realize who is the real master of your estate? Listen, old woman. lf you don't want to see.. ..your grand daughter dead, give us the real key. Rajmata, don't give the key to this murderer. I am not your real Ratna. I am also a cheater like these sinners. Let me die. That will be my punishment. Let me die. The grand daughter for whom.. ..you were guarding the treasure is also false. Your grand daughter is dead. Even if God comes and tells me that Ratna.. ..is not my grand daughter, I won't believe it. My belief cannot cheat me. l can give away all my wealth for Ratna. Here, take the keys. Rob the treasure. But don't touch my dear Ratna with your dirty hands. Boy! O Boy! Our life long mission is fulfilled! It's all ours! Rob it! Jalimsingh! - Here's your Jalimsingh. I am Insaafsingh, partner. Beware! So, Diwan, where have you hidden.. ..the evidences that prove her to be the real princess? So your death has dragged you here? No, Pratap! Don't give him such an easy death. Dare confront us? Peel off his skin, father. Now I will decide your fate. Shoot him, Pratap. This will be better for you. Bastards! Throw away the swords! Pratap! I will kill you. See the result of the greed for money which had blinded you. Open the door, Rajmata. I am Juman Khan. What are you still waiting for after killing your own son? It's not too late. Bow down to Rajmata and repent for your sins. Now tell Rajmata that you've been cheating her.. ..by hiding the real evidences. Yes, Rajmata, she is the real princess. Forgive me. Rajmata, I had promised you that if you give me some time.. ..I will peel off the skin of these two traitors for you. Now these sinners are at your feet. Princess, God has got you to your destination. May you be happy! Rajmata, this sinner wants to bow down.. ..and receive his punishment. Don't touch.. No, Raja, you've done no sin. You are not a sinner. You are the lord of my Ratna. She told me everything in that letter. That is why I trusted you and let you sit in the royal treasury. 'Dear, o dear.' 'Dear, o dear.' 'Come fast and meet me: our youth is passing by.' 'Dear, o dear.' 'Come fast and meet me:
