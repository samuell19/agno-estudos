- [JFK] We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal... - [Man] Three, two, one, zero, all engines running, lift off! We have a lift off, 32 minutes past the hour, lift off on Apollo 11. - [Neil Armstrong] Okay, I'm going to step off the LM now. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. (soft piano music) - [John] The United States is a leading nation when it comes to innovation. It is a country that took man to the moon, and a nation that values our greatest asset: human creativity. NASA and the space program stand as an example to America's ability to think creatively, in order to solve problems and achieve the impossible. (soft piano music) Human creativity has transformed man from the primitive species that we once were, into the global phenomenon that we see today. As educators and parents, we must take an interest in what makes people creative, and if it is something that can be successfully developed in school. For nations that know how to cultivate our most prized asset, are more likely to thrive in a future economy built on ideas, and measured on a nations ability to be inventive. (soft piano music) (bright piano music) - [Susan] If we talk about the people on the street and what they believe about creativity, you'll find that they don't have to think about what creativity is. Or they believe that it is in the realm of the arts, or that creativity is something that belongs to others and they never really thought about it for themselves. - [Juliet] Every teacher that I've ever spoken to has a different definition of creativity, that's one of the interesting things about it, it's not easy to define, everyone has a take it's so multi-faceted. (bright piano music) - [Cynthia] I work in a creative studies department, but when I tell people I teach creativity, people automatically go to the arts. I usually tell people I teach creative thinking, and people say, "Hm, tell me about that." And then I tell them about creative thinking skills, and when I talk about curiosity and openness, and tolerance for ambiguity, and solving problems, then they start to understand what I mean by creativity. - [John] Creativity is not an outcome limited to the arts, but includes a way of thinking that solves problems, generates new knowledge, and spearheads innovation. In recent years, it has produced a revolution in technology where companies like Apple and Google are quite literally changing how we live, learn, work, and play. (bright piano music) The conversation about creativity expands beyond the outcome of a product. In 1961, a creativity scholar named Mel Rhodes clarified the topic around four items that included not only products, but also the person, the process, and environment, or press. This was known as the Four P's Model of Creativity. - [Susan] We can talk about how creativity has to do with personality, and what kind of characteristics are creative, we can talk about processes that people use that lead to creative outcomes. We can talk about environments, particularly in education, we talk about, and in the business world, we talk about the conditions that will allow for creativity. (bright piano music) - [John] The general definition for creativity is something new and useful. While the word new can be quickly defined as original, the word useful requires some more thought. For exactly who must find it useful in order for it to be creative, is open for debate. - [Susan] So if we say, what is creativity? Well, is it a product? And if it is, how do you define that product? Is it new? Well, if it's just new, what if it's useless? What if it's just nonsensical? It doesn't mean anything to anyone. Then we push back and say well, that's not creative. It has to have some value, it has to have some usefulness. - [John] As parents and teachers, we often refer to the most simple act as creative. But how do we separate something like a childhood painting, produced in an elementary classroom, to one by a professional artist that's auctioned for millions of dollars? - [Sally] Creativity consists of what I could call personal creativity. Some people would call this small C, in the sense that all people can live a more creative life. They can take safe risks, they can get out of their routine, they can attempt to be more creative in their work, in their life, in their child raising, in the things that they like to do. And then, of course, there's the other kind of creativity which has been characterized as big C creativity, that makes a difference in your community, your state, your region, the country, the world. (dramatic music) - [John] While not every person will have the talent to paint like Picasso, or play the piano like Mozart, we all have the ability to be creative, for we are born with certain characteristics that help us think creatively. As children, we're naturally curious, open minded, imaginative, and innocent to the defined workings of the real world. We can tolerate ambiguity, use fantasy, visualize things from different perspectives, and quickly produce and consider many ideas. These characteristics have been identified as a creativity skill set, that can dwindle unless consciously nurtured when young. - [Juliet] It's definitely part of the human condition, I do believe that we are all born as creative individuals, but I do think that you can unlearn creativity as much as you can learn to be more creative. And I think that's something that happens much more in schools and institutions, and with young people today, probably more than learning to be creative is that young people can unlearn to be creative. (soft piano music) - [Joseph] I don't think that the education system does very well at teaching creativity. About 99% of going to school is finding the right answer. I think that if you want to teach children how to be creative, you've got to give them problems and opportunities for which there is no single, pre-determined correct answer. - [John] Unfortunately, in our current methods of schooling, many of the problems and activities that students encounter are clearly defined with right and wrong ways to achieve a pre-determined outcome. These circumstances do not require students to think creatively. Instead, they condition them to behave like a computer program, designed to execute a specific set of instructions, in order to achieve the one right answer on an exam. - [Susan] Yeah, when you look at how well the education system promotes creativity, they probably get a D (laughs) at this point. And it's starting to even decline more. - [Cynthia] You know, what our school system is missing right now is this notion of teaching kids how to think on their own, to come up with their own ideas, to ask questions, and to ultimately become life long learners. - If I have pre-determined what I want the outcome to be, then the opportunities for creativity are not present. - [John] If the students ability to think creatively is not adequately nurtured when young, then the chances of them growing into a person who produces something new and useful in a given field is significantly reduced. - [Juliet] If you go and look at young children, nursery aged children working, you will see creativity really happening. They're there collecting the things they need, moving from one place to another, they may even be talking it through for themselves. "If I do this, then will this happen? "What would happen if I did this? "I know, I will go put this on that, "and that will make something else." And as children get older, they start getting pushed into, there's a right answer, there's not a right answer, there's only one answer, you have to do it this way, and so they can unlearn being creative as much as they can learn it. (children talking) - [John] As children progress through the grades, the expectations of the classroom change radically. Children are no longer given the same opportunities to nurture the characteristics we associate with creativity, and as a person, they become less creative. Evidence shows that since the 1990s, some of the most important characteristics needed for creativity have started to decline as students progress through the education system. Dr. Kyung Hee Kim at the college of William and Mary, analyzed the results of 300,000 students and adults who participated in a series of creativity tests. Her study showed that fluency, the ability to produce and consider many alternatives, improves in young children up until grade three, where it then begins a journey of decline. - [Joseph] So much of school does follow a formula, there's a right way to solve a math problem or come up with the right answer in a history course or a science course, and so if we want them to think divergently, looking in many, many different directions rather than convergently, focusing on finding a single pre-determined correct answer, then we've gotta give them experiences that not just allow that, they value that, because that's where creativity comes from. - [John] Another characteristic to suffer as children progress through the grades, is their ability to be original. Similar to fluency, this skill improves through elementary school, but around fifth grade it falls drastically, and only begins to recover after students leave high school. - [Susan] What we do in the education system, is counter to promotion of creativity. And I hear this from teachers all the time, if I have to spend my time, and assessments are important, and standards are good, and being accountable is very important, but what we say those things are, are pretty much messed up at this point, particularly accountability. - [John] A federal system of rigid testing and high stakes accountability now dominate the education system, and threaten our nations most prized asset, the ability to think creatively. What appears to be a decline in creativity, has been referred to as a creativity crisis. In order to better understand this problem, we must examine the federal governments mission in education, and better understand how certain event have shaped education policy, and what we've come to most value in our nations classroom. (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Today a new moon is in the sky, a 23 inch metal sphere placed in orbit by a Russian rocket... - [John] When the Soviet Union launched the first satellite into orbit, it was perceived as a threat to national security, and more importantly, economic supremacy. How was it that the world super power had fallen so far behind in the space race? In its aftermath, the United States quickly attributed this failure to education and a lack of creative thinking on the part of engineers and scientists. - [Joseph] I think a real turning point, as far as our concern for developing high level talent in this country, occurred at the time Sputnik, all of the sudden we realized that we were not the leading nation in the world when it came to the exploration of space and all the technology that goes with that. And so the federal government immediately jumped into the act, and they passed a bill, and the name of the bill was very interesting, because they called it The National Defense Education Act, NDEA. - [John] Under the leadership of President Eisenhower, the National Defense Education Act allocated one billion dollars for education over a period of four years. Designed to spearhead innovation by promoting science, engineering, and mathematics, this act would demonstrate success for the federal government in education, and spark the kind of creativity that would eventually put man on the moon. - Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik. We had no idea how we would beat them to the moon. The science wasn't even there yet, NASA didn't exist. But after investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets, we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs. - [John] Though short lived, the National Defense Education Act became the first intervention to establish a justified mission for the federal government in education, to defend the economy and provide a work force that could compete against foreign competition. Almost a decade later, the federal government would begin its second mission under the leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, and establish legislation that would be forever used to shape the system of schooling in this country. - [Daniel] President Johnson decided he was gonna make one serious stab at combating poverty, it was known as the War on Poverty, and he believed that if you could inject a large, sums of federal monies directly into school districts, that you may have a chance of dealing with the problem of poverty. - [John] Johnson's war on poverty led to one of the largest education bills of all time. Signed into law outside a Texas high school, the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act has been re-authorized under nearly every president since its inception. On each occasion, it has been revised to reflect the educational policies of each administration, and used to implement the federal governments mission in education, which in 1983, would shift drastically under the leadership of President Reagan, where the needs of the economy would once again be placed at the forefront of education policy. - [Daniel] Since the publication in 1983 of a very powerful report known as A Nation At Risk, that the federal government has begun to clarify its role as one of supporting schools, essentially as agents of economic growth and development. - [John] A Nation at Risk expressed concern that the US was losing its competitive edge in terms of business and industry. "Our once challenged preeminence in commerce, "industry, science, and technological innovation "is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world." The report complained that the gains made after Sputnik had been squandered because of a watered down curriculum, that was described as, "A cafeteria style curriculum, "which the appetizers and desserts can easily "be mistaken for the main courses." After A Nation At Risk, the federal government increased its funding and influence over schooling, in an effort to better prepare students to compete in the global economy. This effort has slowly re-shaped the goal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is now focused as much toward combating poverty as it is toward promoting economic development. - [Daniel] Many of the efforts that have been made since 1983 and during the presidency of recent presidents, is to somehow shape schooling, in a way that it develops curricula, forms of assessment, forms of teacher appraisal, which feed into their goal of seeing schools as an arm of economic growth and development. - [John] But efforts to improve schooling have failed to close the achievement gap, and student test scores in the United States continue to decline when compared to other nations around the world. In response to the perceived failure, the federal government enacted a back to the basics movement, centered on a rigid system of accountability that has now become the backbone of our education system. - First principle is accountability. Every school has a job to do, and that's to teach the basics, and teach them well. - [John] In 2002, President George W. Bush passed into law his administrations re-authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which received a new name, and a significant makeover. - It was right after 9/11, and Congress wanted something positive to happen, and my sense is that they crafted it without reading it. They knew the title, No Child Left Behind, and who could be opposed to that title? But it had almost nothing to do with the real mission that was in the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was for equality of opportunity for all. - [John] The No Child Left Behind law placed greater emphasis on annual tests. Schools that made adequate yearly progress would receive an increase in funding, but those that failed would be punished, and this was particularly challenging when the benchmarks that it set were considered unattainable. - [Karen] In order to greet adequately yearly process they want every student in the school to be achieving, regardless of what sort of special education needs that the children have, or what sort of backgrounds they have Students for example, who speak English as a second language. They would be expected to achieve at exactly the same level as a student who'd been in the school system for seven, eight, nine years. - [John] While assessment is an important part of our education system, when too much emphasis is placed on the outcome of a test, the impact to the curriculum can be severe. As teachers begin to devote much of their time to teaching only the content that will be measured on the test. - [Elizabeth] When teachers teach to the test, what that means is that the only thing teachers teach is what they figure is probably going to be on the test, and they look at old tests, and they see what it is, and they teach the kinds of questions, they teach the range of questions, and they have the children practice filling in forms, and that's all the children are doing, is getting ready for the test. - [John] Like many of its predecessors, the No Child Left Behind law has done very little to promote the natural characteristics that make us creative. Opportunities to nurture curiosity, imagination, and originality, have been removed from many classrooms, in order to prepare students for high stakes examinations. - I think the pendulum shifted terribly in the opposite direction during the Bush era, with No Child Left Behind. No Child Left Behind probably was the biggest death knell to creativity of anything that I've seen in the 40 odd years that I've been in education. - [John] As students become accustomed to being told what they must do in order to succeed on a test, they become less likely to think outside the box, or produce work that is considered original. Instead, the develop comfort in pre-determined outcomes, that are clearly defined, with specific information that tells them exactly what they must do and how they must do it. - Watering it down to things that are very basic, we're not doing our job to provide citizens that can think, and provide a work force with diverse skills and the ability to tolerate ambiguity, complexity, think for themselves, and be original, and produce in different ways. - [John] While the importance of learning content is undisputed, the rigid system used to evaluate its progress has created an unequal balance, between nurturing creativity, and teaching content that can easily be measured on a test. - There's this unequal balance, when you think about content versus creativity. And for very simple reasons, content knowledge is very easy to measure. Does it matter that we measure it? Maybe, maybe not. Creativity is much harder to measure. - [John] As educators attempt to satisfy government policy, instructional practices have moved away from activities that challenge students to think creatively, and toward drill and kill culture that focuses almost entirely on memorizing the content that will most likely appear on the test. - So post Sputnik in the United States, 1957, post that period our government started to value scientific inquiry, discovery, space travel, it valued more challenging content for students. Now I think academically talented students are being routinely held back by test preparation policies and I think there's very little attention placed on the highest level of talent, A, or B, opportunities for high levels of creativity in children. - [John] The test prep policies, which have emerged in an era of accountability and assessment, fail to develop the creative skills required for our economy, and this is in conflict with the governments main mission in education. (soft piano music) - [Obama] None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be, or where the new jobs will come from. 30 years ago, we couldn't know that something called the internet would lead to an economic revolution. What we can do, what America does better than anyone else, is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. - [John] As our economy becomes one centered on information and technology, the ability to think creatively has become an essential ingredient for success. In an extensive IBM poll, creativity was listed as the most important leadership skill by 1500 CEO's from around the world. Creativity is no longer a transient fad, but something considered essential to a nations economic growth. - Creativity is so important in education. Creativity is the foundation for innovation, and when you think about our society, whether it be our national society, or our global society, new ideas are what are critical to the success and growth of the nation and the world. - One single idea can start an entire industry, and we look at people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, for example, and think of the millions of people employed just because they came up with certain kinds of ideas. - You can name any career field, and say why creativity's important, but the problem is, it's not being taught, so people are going out into the work force, and I see this happen all the time with our undergrads, they go out into the work force, and they don't know how to be creative in their environment. They don't know where to start, they don't know how to think for themselves, and that's where the problem is. - [John] Unfortunately, the ambiguity that surrounds creativity often leaves most people to question if it's something that can be taught in school. - [Cynthia] I have been teaching creativity for the last 12 years, and I can absolutely, 100% tell you that creativity can be taught, and I've watched it with people who have said, "I'm not creative, I can't be creative", to, "I really feel like I'm a creative person "and here's why: I'm a better problem solver, "I'm more curious, I'm more open minded, "I can tolerate ambiguity." - [John] Since the 1950s, a tremendous amount of knowledge has been generated about how we can teach and cultivate the characteristics we associate with creativity. A creativity scholar named E. Paul Torrance, is not only credited with identifying many of our creative characteristics, but also instructional approaches that have been used to successfully teach creativity. His most famous, the Torrance Incubation Model of Teaching and Learning, is designed to teach creativity while teaching the content. - [Susan] One of the breakthroughs in the field of creativity, if you look at the fact that you can teach for creativity, while you teach another content, that took it to a different level... What's unique about the Torrance Incubation Model, is the fact that teachers are always saying, "I don't have time" and they don't. So how is it that we could integrate creativity into our daily practice and education, to teach our content and teach for creativity. - [John] Called TIM for short, this instructional approach not only identifies a content goal for a lesson, but also a creativity goal from the skill set than Torrance identified. This creativity goal is then integrated into three distinct components, that are used to structure the lesson and deliver its content. - [Susan] It's one of the few models that allows for the integration of creativity into whatever you're teaching, so that you teach what you teach well, and you teach it better because you are teaching creativity. - [John] While a variety of instructional methods designed to teach creativity have been proven successful, the most appealing in recent years has been within the movement toward teaching 21st century skills, which manifest as part of a project-based learning environment. - [Joseph] You can't teach 21st century skills out of a book, you've gotta get kids involved in a self-selected project that they can become motivated and enthusiastic about. You've gotta give them the kinds of tools that make them investigative thinkers, rather than just simply accumulating and storing knowledge so they can spit it back on the test. - [John] In a survey of film students who participated in a project-based learning environment, to produce content for a student film festival in the state of Connecticut, 68% listed creativity or problem solving as the number one skill developed as part of this process. While project-based learning has many different variations, which include problem based learning, design based learning, and more recently, challenge based learning, they all share the goal of challenging students to explore a real world problem, as part of a student centered environment that remains absent of any pre-determined outcome. - So generally, they are real world problems, you want to try to find something that has applicability in the world so it has relevance to the student. - [Student] Red, yellow, I mean, the white is for explorer questions, the light blue is for constellation questions. - [John] One appeal to project-based learning is the need for students to problem solve and think independently in order to generate their own ideas as part of a meaningful process of creative problem finding. - [Frank] I'm often baffled when I hear about teachers that send their students home at night and say, "come up with five ideas for your project tomorrow." And what a disservice we're doing to students by not letting them experience problem finding, looking at resources, evaluating options, thinking about the choices that will make them successful. - [John] When implemented correctly, not only do students have an opportunity to generate and explore new ideas, but during the implementation process, they also can self-select the areas that most appeal to their own creative skills and interests, and this has a long lasting impact on a students creative path in life. - [Sally] The longitudinal studies that we've done of kids over decades have shown, when children get involved in highly creative, productive project-based learning work, they're more likely to seek out that work in the future, they're more likely to do projects at home, to seek work that is more creative. - [Girl] See how they have like, pumpkins in the pumpkin, you could do that, what are you gonna do for the thing? - [John] Another appeal to project-based learning is the existence of a student centered environment, where the teacher merely acts as the facilitator of the learning process, a role very different from the teacher centered approach that has manifested in a world of accountability and assessment. - You can't do good project-based learning, in a step by step method. These are ill defined problems, problems that, hopefully the teacher has no idea what the solution is, and the direction that the students take the work is critical to that process. So if you don't know the recipe to solving a problem, that's a great thing. - [John] As educators and parents, we must begin to use our own creativity, to identify opportunities for students to generate original ideas that have value beyond the classroom, and while achieving this in an era of accountability and assessment can be difficult, it is possible. - I think it's a little bit of a cop out, to say that because we live in an age of accountability that we can't teach creativity, because they absolutely can work together. - Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will please come to order. I'd like to thank all of you for being here today as we continue to discuss reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. - [John] In 2009, President Obama released his administrations education blueprint for reform, a proposal for the latest reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. While acknowledging some of the perceived failures of No Child Left Behind, the focus remains toward economic development. - Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America's success. But if we want to win the future, if we want innovation to produce jobs in America, and not overseas, then we also have to win the race to educate our kids. - [John] In exchange for federal funds, some level of accountability and assessment must be expected, but the federal government must recognize that the greater emphasis on examinations has not improved test scores, or closed the achievement gap. What's required is an equal emphasis in the development and cultivation of the skills associated with creativity, so that a greater number of students can join what Richard Florida from the Martin Prosperity Institute has referred to as an emerging creative class, that is set to dominate the future job market. - Well I'll tell you an interesting story. About six years ago, I was teaching a course here at Buffalo State, and it was all freshman. And I went in to teach an introduction to creative studies course. And when I was teaching this course, they kept raising their hand, and they kept saying, "Okay, well what do we need to know, "what do we need to know, "what do we need to know?" And I said, "What do you mean, what do you need to know?" "Well what's going to be on the test?" What's going to be on the test? There aren't any tests in creative studies. (soft piano music) - [John] With the introduction of the Common Core standards in 2012, and current advances in digital technology, we now have a real opportunity to explore this content through original works of art that can stimulate creative growth, and engage a greater number of students in our most important acronym, but we must begin to equip educators with the skills required to cultivate creativity, as they explore this content, otherwise this opportunity will be lost. - I think there will always be some individuals that are extremely creative, that will buck the trend, that will go against the grain. They're not always easy people to get on with, they're not always people that schools like, they're not always people that get on well with other people, because actually, they're individualists, they think their own thoughts, they do their own things. I think those people will always exist. But, I think the huge majority of people will not fulfill their own potential, if they are pushed into thinking only in a certain way to pass a certain test, if they're channeled down routes that say there's this right answer, and that right answer, and this wrong answer. Then, we have got a problem. - [John] While we may continue to progress for some time on the backs of a few individuals, our eventual needs for the many will become too great, the cure for cancer, the answer to our warming climate, the solution to our growing population, and the many wonders yet to be discovered could be lost, if the individuals with the right combination of knowledge and talent are never given an opportunity to fulfill their creative potential. - [Joseph] We really need to make sure that we provide opportunities for creative thinking on the parts of larger numbers of kids, we always revert to the same two or three examples. Imagine if we were able to talk about a hundred Steve Jobs, and a hundred Bill Gates, and a hundred Steven Spielbergs, and all of a sudden we realize that there's so much more that can be developed and can be created and produced by our society, by our culture. - I think there's a lot of dangerous things happening in education, I think that's a strong word but I believe that we're really undermining our creative potential, and it's critical as we look at a more uncertain future, that we are prepared for that. I think more now than in any other decade, if we are not willing to bring forward the creative potential of our students, knowledge alone is not going to get us very far. - [Obama] President Eisenhower signed legislation to create NASA and invest in science and math education, from grade school to graduate school. - [Man] Space shuttle now on internal power. - [Obama] In the years that have followed, the space race inspired a generation of scientists and innovators. - [Man] Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen fill and drain valves are closed. - [Obama] For me, the space program has always captured an essential part of what it means to be an American. Reaching for new heights, stretching beyond what previously did not seem possible. - [John] We are all born with natural characteristics that make us creative. Combined with individual talent and motivation, our creative potential is part of a freedom we hold so dear. Many scientists and scholars lost their lives to bring forth new perspectives and new knowledge for our world. - [Man] And the hand-off to Atlantis' onboard... - [John] The period of enlightenment that began in Western Europe brought forth a new nation, built on ideas and innovation. We have come too far to turn back now. President Obama stated, "This is our generations Sputnik moment." so let's do what we do best and get creative. With just a few small steps, we can once again cultivate creativity in our schools, and bring about the next giant leap for mankind.
