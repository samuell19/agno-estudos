When I came here my dream was to play in the first squad and I never imagined I would experience everything that followed, but I'm happy about all that's happened to me. I had to live in Barcelona I ended up going through it all because God wanted it and I'm grateful. Managing to stay for a long time in a club like this is extremely difficult. I had the enthusiasm, conviction and confidence that I wanted to succeed at Barça, whatever the cost. Seeing my name as one of the world's best players or being nominated Footballer of the Year was unthinkable when I began at 16, 17 or 18. We've overcome every barrier and dream one could have. WE ARE BARÇA Messi. Iniesta. And Xavi. Three unique players in the history of football. Born with a ball at their feet, they grew up dreaming of glory. and achieved much more than they could ever have imagined. They coincided in a legendary team, at a time when football became the greatest sport show on the planet. Barça has thousands of members, millions of fans and a playing group trained to follow a game plan that has revolutionized the world of football in recent years. Barcelona. A friendly, vibrant, attractive and modern city that has been open to the world for centuries. It is renowned for the legacy of the architect Antoni Gaudí and many other 20th century artists and creators. But among these now, are also the football geniuses who have played for Futbol Club Barcelona, for they have also contributed to making the city more famous. Whenever a match is played at the stadium, the club's exciting history resounds. Today, it is one of the world's most famous clubs. But its true history remains unknown to many people. It was founded in 1899. And interestingly enough, not by a Catalan, but by a 22 year old Swiss man named Joan Gamper. A lover of all sports, not just football, he left the ordered, peaceful landscape of his native Switzerland for a bustling, emerging Barcelona in search of a better future. He was a true sportsman. He's a fan of all sports and plays them all. He met other people in places that were very important then, the few gyms that existed in Barcelona. People who were crazy about sport used to meet there. They were looked upon as somewhat eccentric. When Gamper announced he wanted to set up Barça, twelve people responded to his call, the club's founders. Of these twelve, half of them were foreigners and the other half were Catalans. The first president was Swiss, Walter Wild. Joan Gamper could not take the post because of his age. He was under 23. But he was always the life and soul of the club. He initially wanted to be the team's captain and play, [Joan Gamper's granddaughter] and later join the board, but not to be president. [Joan Gamper's granddaughter] He wanted to participate from a distance. And if the club had problems, he took over and got it back on track again. He'd collect signatures or money to keep the club afloat. These sports lovers transformed a small group of friends into a great football club. In the 10s and 20s, a competitive Barça was already attracting crowds to its stadium in Industria street. And later, to the neighborhood of Les Corts. Football was becoming fashionable, but there were not enough seats, so many fans would sit on top of the walls around the stadium, thereby exposing a series of backsides, or "culs", in the process. So the city's inhabitants dubbed them "culés", a term still used today. Football was becoming a spectacle, and the players went from being amateurs to professionals. If previously they had payed for membership to play, they now demanded payment. It was a painful change for Gamper's spirit for amateur sport. He still believed in amateur sport. However he had founded a club that was growing bigger and to move in higher places, this step became inevitable, as it was the direction football was heading to. Gamper was an idealist who would have liked to live in classical Greece, and participate in the ancient Games, testing his physical and mental endurance. He understood sports as a way to educate oneself in the values of friendship, respect, and competitiveness. Values that are difficult to maintain in any modern day competition. Nonetheless, Barça has driven to maintain these ideals of its founder, especially in recent years. Those who see football as a religion know that Barça is about more than playing football. It teaches you a great deal about the sport, but especially at a human level, to think about your teammates and the group before yourself. Barça promotes these values, respect, caring, humility, work, effort, sacrifice. I arrived when I was 13 and was brought up here with the values of Barça and La Masia. And more than just playing football, they also educate you really well. La Masia contributed a lot to my personality. The things I've been able to grow up with, in terms of respect, education, humility, respecting your teammates, were all about learning and having to improve each year. The noble values of competition have always existed, but they have not always been promoted. They have often been buried by passion, ambition, combativeness, money, or politics. Football is, by far, the most popular sport on the planet, but it's difficult to imagine it free from all these conflicts and interests. Gamper today would not believe the amounts of money that move the football world, over 20 billion Euros, or signing major stars for up to 100 million. As the true lover of sport that he was, he was troubled by the big business that was already moving football then. Actually, there are jokes about the time he was negotiating contracts with players and he wanted to give them some "love-for-the-club" vitamins, so that they'd ask for less money after taking them. Gamper was a committed man, a dreamer. His love for the club helped him to overcome many obstacles, such as a lack of funds, which he covered with his own money. Or reprisals against Catalan demonstrations in the 1920s. Even then Barça was becoming a symbol of Catalan identity, that ran counter to the Spanish dictatorship of the time, and this brought with it a few problems. They once closed the ground. An English Navy squadron had come [Former FCB member nº1] with an English football team [Former FCB member nº1] and played against Barça. The English anthem was played, with everybody standing, and there was applause at the end, but nobody stood up for the Spanish anthem, so they close the ground for six months. It is surprising that 90 years later, under full democracy, many Catalans, once again, jeered the Spanish anthem, as they did at this Kings' Cup Final a few years ago. The authorities installed 100.000 watt speakers to drown out the jeers, but it didn't work. Many Catalans continue to demand their right as a nation, with their own culture, and they do not feel truly comfortable with Spanish political power. Joan Gamper had to play the price for the anger directed against the anthem in 1925. The authorities punished him by banishing him from the club and the country. And although he was allowed to return later, he could not hold any posts in the club. This sank him into a depression, that was aggravated by the devastating effects of the Wall Street Crash. Isolated from the club and a destroyed man, Gamper committed suicide at 52 years of age. It really shocked a lot of people. If Gamper had thought that nobody would remember him, [JOAN GAMPER FUNERAL, 31 July 1930] it wasn't true since his funeral proved the opposite, with an incredible number of people on the streets. The morals of the day kept his suicide quiet. Gamper, however, had left behind a very dynamic football club. The Crash of '29 destroyed many clubs, but not Barça, as it had grown and become firmly established. The club had until then experienced a golden age, producing several legendary players, like Samitier, or the extraordinary Paulino Alcántara, the first great goal scorer in Spanish football, with a total of 357 goals. He was dubbed "The Netbreaker". In terms of sport, the 1920s is known as Barça's first golden age, because it actually won nearly everything from 1919 to 1929. The number of trophies is truly impressive. It was also famous for a few players, Zamora debuted at the same time as the big player Samitier, but others came later, Sagi, Platko, very important names in the Club's history. Barça's fame extended far and wide, even to the Americas. The famous Argentine singer, Carlos Gardel, dedicated this tango to the Barça stars of the day. ♪ You are so bad, you are always offside ♪ ♪ You never control a ball, You think you are a star ♪ ♪ And you can't even shoot a free kick ♪ ♪ You want to be a forward And be like Piera ♪ ♪ Emulate Sastre And score from the center of the pitch ♪ ♪ You want to score past colossal Zamora ♪ ♪ And be like Sami, the football wizard ♪ But the roaring 20s also had bitter counterpoints. The authorities had closed the Barça ground for six months because the Spanish anthem was jeered. And Gamper was banished from the country. After Gamper's death, things would become much worse in the thirties, as growing political exultation in Spain would lead to its tragic Civil War. Barça was a club that reflected Catalan society, so logically it was affected by the beginning of the Civil War. Its institutions collapsed, it membership decreased and it underwent a financial crisis. But above all, this great team, which had practically won everything between 1919 and 1929, stopped winning. Given that Barça defended the Catalan majority view in favor of democracy, the Catalan identity and the Republic, it became the target of fascist anger. The club house was bombed, and its president, Josep Suñol, was killed by Franco's forces. The bombing of Barcelona caused more than a thousand deaths in just three days, in March 1938. The bombs destroyed Barça's offices, shattering many of the trophies it had won until then. In recent times, the remains were smelted to create a sculpture recalling this tragedy. The Civil War claimed many lives and demoralized the Catalans, the majority of whom had opted for the Republic, the losing side. After the war, the fascist dictatorship of General Franco, who would remain in power as a historical anachronism for 40 years, took its toll. Barça was in a very delicate position, because it had earlier clearly expressed its support of democratic ideals and the Catalan identity. Catalan had been the official language of the club since 1921 and then suddenly in 1939 it finds itself under a dictatorship... that wants to control not just Barça, but all sporting clubs in Spain, which is why the boards were directly named by the Falangist National Sports Delegation. The most obvious thing for Barça was that it was somehow forced to show that this Barça was nothing like the previous one, so it had to renounce all the values implicit in the club prior to the Civil War. While the world was in flames during the Second World War, Spain was a devastated country. All the clubs attempted to recover. Young people saw football as a way to escape, even if they had to pay for their boots, shirts and ball. A ball called "Nitran". We had to paint them white to play at night because there weren't any white balls. All of them were the colour of leather. They weighed 100 grams and if they were kicked around over a wet pitch by the end of the match they weighed about a kilo or a kilo and a half. We didn't have the gloves that they have now. Sometimes I think, how has he lost the ball when it's impossible with their gloves? We had woollen gloves crocheted by my mother and we only wore them when it rained. After the war, in 1942, Barça had only 3,500 members, and was about to be relegated to the Second Division. The authorities had changed its crest to remove the four bars of the Catalan flag and replaced it with the two bars of the Spanish flag. And its name was now in Spanish, "Club de Fútbol Barcelona". The club experienced some very hard times, but it gradually recovered and produced new legends, like the goalkeeper Antoni Ramallets. Antonio was everybody's idol. He was known as "the winged cat". It's funny because he used to take his goalie's kit home to be washed and ironed by his mother, because we bought them ourselves. Not like now when they give them away after the match. If I'd done that, I wouldn't have had any on game day. No Barça player of the last century can be compared to Ladislao Kubala-- a Hungarian with Slovak parents who'd fled the communist regime, and dreamed of settling in Spain. He had spent his childhood playing football in the streets of Budapest, was blessed with great talent, and had the build that would bring him success. He joined Barça in 1950, initiating a new golden age. Kubala is one of the great Barça legends, a very good player and was also surrounded by some very major non-sporting matters at the time, given that he was essentially a refugee fleeing from the Eastern Bloc, which was all about Cold War dynamics... He came to Barça and really created a football revolution. He controlled the ball really well, with both feet with amazing ease. Sometimes he would sit on the ground like in the circus and kick the ball upwards... And why? Because Kubala could control the ball, even in his sleep. He showed people things they hadn't seen before. People went to matches just to see Kubala play. This was the five-cup Barça. Everyone wanted to play in Barça then. Kubala in the 1950s was one of the people who gave the club a football and social dimension that was above the norm. All the most popular figures of the day wanted to be connected to Kubala in some way. Barça's culture has always been about play, but the person who showed this on the field was a foreigner. It's interesting that it happened with Kubala, with Cruyff, with Ronaldinho, with Messi. This is another thing that doesn't happen much in many clubs. Barça can create a team, but it's a foreigner who usually makes the difference, soaking up a lot from Barça's game system and culture and giving it a dimension that would be difficult for a player from here. And it's very much in line with Gamper's spirit. Kubala replaces Gamper at the top of the list of history-making names. And he does so as a hugely popular idol who transcends borders. With him, Barça becomes the best football team of the day, with a dramatic rise in membership. It therefore has to build a new stadium, Camp Nou, which opens in 1957 with a capacity for 93,000 spectators. CAMP NOU OPENING 24 September 1957 The largest stadium in Europe. This Barça wins four League titles and five Spanish Cups in ten years. And also the European trophy at the time, the Latin Cup, as there wasn't any European Cup. Barça was the dominant force not only in Spain, but also played a very major role in Europe. Barça experiences its best period since the end of the Civil War. It plays the best football, has the best European player, and is now ready to sign the best South American player, the Argentine Alfredo Di Stéfano, registered to River Plate, but playing for Bogotá's Millonarios. With two star players, Barcelona would be without any rivals for years to come. But Real Madrid, which has not won a League title for 21 years, interferes in the signing. Barça had reached an agreement with River Plate, which was the Argentine club that owned the rights to Di Stéfano, and what Madrid did was reach an agreement with Bogotá's Millonarios, the team Di Stéfano was playing in, and I emphasis the words at the time, "in defiance". The player could only be signed from River Plate as they owned his registration rights, so Barça was legally doing the right thing. Di Stéfano comes to Barcelona and trains with the players. They want him to play in a friendly, but joint action is taken by the Federation, Real Madrid, and the Falangist National Sports Delegation to stop the process. Then you can see how the legislation on the entry of foreign players changes daily. When Barça already has him signed, the Federation decides that foreign players can't enter, but revokes the order when he might go to Madrid. There's a constant to and fro in terms of legal actions in the summer of 1953 so that Di Stéfano can't join Barça. The fact that the dictatorship favored Real Madrid could be explained by its mistrust of Barça, because of its Catalan nationalist history. The conflict dragged on for many months. The Spanish Football Federation ruled that Di Stéfano would end up playing one year in each team, starting with Real Madrid, a humiliating solution that Barça rejected. Real Madrid's history is built on Di Stéfano. Madrid's world-renowned history is based on the five European Cups it wins with Di Stéfano. It is no wonder that this case would go on to create a huge sense of grievance and discontent, which would deepen the Madrid success and Barça's failures in the 60s. As Barça slumped, Real Madrid took advantage of the sympathy between its board and the regime, and went on to conquer five consecutive European Cups, thanks to the brilliant generation of players led by Di Stéfano. With Kubala's retirement in 1961, Barça was drowning in the millions of debt it owed to build Camp Nou - two hundred and eighty four million pesetas at the time. And had to sell its best player, Golden Ball winner Luis Suárez. [LUIS SUÁREZ, GOLDEN BALL 1960] Barcelona had to sell Luisito Suárez, which would be like us selling Messi now. So let's say we don't have Messi. Would we notice his departure? Of course we would. The same thing was true with Luisito Suárez. A period then begins that is incredibly poor in sporting terms, those 14 years without a league title, which can be explained not only by some relatively poor decisions when it came to signings, but also mainly because of a lack of finances. It's our eternal rival that's winning everything and it began with some government favours, but that doesn't explain your mistakes. It was a combination of things and so many years of hardship often produce a certain feeling of victimisation. For many years, fans' emotions would alternate between victimization and anger, accompanied by harsh criticism of the players, often accusing them of money-grabbing, and betraying the spirit of Gamper's love for the club in favor of money. Criticism always hurts. It would be a worry if it didn't hurt. If they criticise you and say that your work on the pitch is not up to scratch or not the best in the world, it's always upsetting, but criticism makes you improve and want to get better. People think that you have to win everything very easily, that Barça has always been a winning club, but it hasn't always been like that. The 60s were the worst in the club's history. Its bitterness and paralysis were in contrast with the world's awakening. The cultural revolution with groups like The Beatles. The May uprising in France, social movements, the Space Race between the US and the USSR, and the first man on the Moon. [ARMSTRONG:] ...each of the two hemispheres of Earth. Underneath it says, "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon... ...cause I have a dream... It was a time of social and economic progress, the spread of democracy. But while Spain continued to be ruled by General Franco's dictatorship, most people wanted the country to enter quickly into the modern era that was being felt in Europe. The Dutch team Ajax Amsterdam was the envy of the football world. Ajax wrested European dominance from Real Madrid, and revolutionized the game with a new philosophy - total football, which was devised by the team's coach, Rinus Michels. A demoralized Barça discovered the revelation it was looking for in the Netherlands. Rinus Michels was the first to come, and a year later it was the biggest Dutch star Johan Cruyff, who received a rock star welcome. [Barcelona Airport - El Prat] Cruyff was in this sense a revelation on the playing field, alongside his image as a young, modern player who also had his mind on other things. They asked him about divorce and things that nobody had been able to talk about before here and he spoke openly as a very liberal person from that point of view. Cruyff certainly had an image and symbolised the Europe that we couldn't gain access to. He gave us new hope and so we started perfecting the type of football that came from the Netherlands, which Rinus Michels had already brought over and incorporated here, "Total Football", with all us players running hard and applying pressure. It was Cruyff who honed the system. In that year when we swept the board. From the beginning, when I started to play in that season, we didn't lose any matches to win the league title. All the public was behind us, all the press and all of Spain, all the results went our way, so the team was so confident that nobody could stop us. I'd probably crack my head open if I tried that today, but it was a cross that I received and I didn't know what to do. I could do headers, but they weren't anything special, so I turned and jumped and was very lucky to strike the ball well into the goal. Everyone talks about the before and after of that match. It was very clearly a moment that had arrived after 14 years. I think it was a great blow in all aspects. 1974 was a magic year for Barça. Five-nil against Madrid at the Bernabéu and the League title. A major blow that hurt Real Madrid's pride and increased Barça's self-esteem. It was Barça's revenge, [Sant Jaume Square, Barcelona - 14 May 1974] for until then the culés had a complex about the almighty Madrid, pampered by the regime. I think Barça is "Més que un club". I mean, obviously, you become aware of the history, you become aware of the fact that was pretty much the place where they could speak their language during, you know, the Franco days, and civil unrest. And you hear these stories about... people, you know, being in prison because of speaking Catalan, etc. I... got the sensation that... the club, Barça, was almost like a representation of Catalonia against the rest of Spain and, in particular, Franco's Real Madrid. And hence such a great rivalry. And I think even as a foreigner, as a foreign player coming in, you sort of grasp that importance, significance. I remember my first game, that was at Madrid. When we arrived, they would just be going "Spain, Spain!", as if to say, "We are Spain, you are not Spain", you know? And it was unbe... That's when you start seeing that, that's when you want to really find out what it's about. Absolutely! A lot of people I know think that when Barça plays against Real Madrid, it's really Catalonia versus Spain. It's hard to explain, you have to experience it and understand it. The rivalry between Barça and Madrid first began only in the sporting sense, but it now obviously transcends things and is about politics. In the 80s and 90s, a minority of radical fans from both clubs caused many problems inside and outside stadiums. Supporter groups such as Real Madrid's, Ultra Sur, or Futbol Club Barcelona's, Boixos Nois, carried their sporting rivalry to incendiary extremes. Until the boards of both clubs decided to take steps to isolate and prohibit them from entering football fields. In recent years, Barcelona Futbol Club's determined attitude to eradicate violence has led to good results. These images have today become history, and the rivalry between fans has become more respectful, and sporting in nature. But Barça-Madrid is unique. It's not... For a start, they're from different cities. I'm sure there must be other rivalries in world football that are strong, but... I don't think there's anything like this one, El Clásico, is. There's always been a very strong rivalry between these two winning teams, because they want to win and always want to be on top. Perhaps things have become a little more exaggerated in recent years, but that often happens. It's always been that way and I don't think it will ever change. Definitely not. It all wouldn't be as passionate and perhaps we wouldn't be as "culé" as we are now, because everyone sometimes needs a sense of animosity to perhaps somehow improve. You have to identify a rival to be competitive, if not both competitiveness and competition would become meaningless. So Madrid is obviously one of Barça's major rivals. Over the last 20 years, the classic duel between Barça and Madrid has become one of the world's major sporting events. And it is passionately followed by millions of people across five continents. A fight that promotes and benefits the spectacle of football, and the popularity of both clubs. But after its brilliant 1974 season, with Johan Cruyff humiliating Real Madrid and convincingly winning the League title, success went to the heads of the players and the board, and things began to change. Just as Michels was in charge and did everything in the first year, in the second year Cruyff began to skip training. He would play on Sunday, a massage on Monday, who knows what on Tuesday, a day off on Wednesday, a bath and massage on Thursday... He began losing his speed and if a player loses his speed he's gone. And he didn't have the same motivation in his second and third year. Johan Cruyff's star on the plain field faded away until his departure in 1978. But both he and coach Rinus Michels had already imbued Barça with a new personality. Immediately after Cruyff, Barça would win few titles to excite the enthusiasm of fans, except for a European Winners' Cup in Basel in 1979. That Winners' Cup breathed new life into its growing fan base, which was becoming increasingly more demanding at its players. But the club still did not have a sufficiently clear direction. The merits of innovating its playing system was still not obvious enough in the 70s and 80s, whereas the media advantages of signing superstars were. After the Cruyff experience, Barça sought out a new star player in 1982. Nobody wanted a repeat of the Di Stéfano case, so Barça made sure to sign the star to a contract worth millions. Watching Maradona was like watching a spectacle in itself. He made a mistake by not integrating into Catalan society. He lived behind a wall in his house as if was still in Argentina, not as if he was in Barcelona. So all his circle of friends and people were Argentine and he thought that Catalan society had to somehow surrender to Maradona and not Maradona integrating into Catalan society. Even his agent, Jorge Cysterpiller, did things in a very curious way. The difficulty he had in integrating somehow forced him to seek comfort or refuge in things like sex, drugs... ordinary things, in a way. But I think he did it out of necessity. He obviously received very bad advice and fell into traps that a player of his class theoretically shouldn't have, but later we also saw what happened with his life. Everyone felt that Maradona would make history wherever he went. He went to Naples and did so, then he went to the Argentine team and scored those famous goals against England. He was an introverted 21- or 22-year-old when he got here and things didn't work out, but people still worship Maradona a little because of who he was and what he meant. Tango's before my time. I like to listen to it, but I'm not a big fan. When Maradona went to Naples, one of Barça's smartest players of all time, Xavi Hernández, was dreaming of some day becoming a football magician, like the Argentine star. As a four-and-a-half year old, Xavi was always kicking a ball around everywhere, as if nothing else existed in the world. This and a pair of football boots. It's true. It was the only thing I liked as a kid. You could give me any present, but I always asked for a ball. I asked for one on my birthday, for Christmas, on Kings' Day... Although I had, I always wanted another. Their obsession with the ball from early childhood would make them exceptional players for Barça. They never let go of it. The playing idea instilled into them as kids was this - if you always have the ball, the opposition will never be able to beat you. A few years earlier, grassroots football had come around to this philosophy of play, thanks to Rinus Michels and the club's trainers, in the belief that training players at home was better than signing individual foreign players with another culture. In 1979, the youth residence, La Masía, was set up to accommodate and train grassroots football kids from outside Barcelona. Among them, were two boys who would go on to make history - Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova. The two were discovered by recruiters, traveling through towns and villages in search of future talent. But it would still be another few years before the club had true confidence in its squad. Barça was still committed to big signings, some of whom were problematic characters, such as Bernd Schuster, from Germany. With him, Barça would once again win a national League title in 1985, after 11 years of missing out. And a year later, it would return to playing a European Cup Final. Twenty five years had passed since its last. Everyone assumed Barça would win, but the team came up against the stubborn defense of its opponents, Steaua Bucharest. It ended in a 0-0 draw, and a tragic penalty shootout. There was so much over-confidence that it rubbed off on the players, because it's not normal to go to a penalty shootout and miss all five. The goal was 7.32 metres wide then, but it seemed to be 3 metres! Duckadam was their goalie and was known for stopping penalties. I don't know if I kicked it badly or he stopped it, as it happened to all of us. It's almost impossible that those five quality Barça players couldn't kick a goal. I think it's the biggest disappointment in Barça's history. It really hurts. It hurts a lot. You can be a good team, have great players, but you don't always win. You have to accept that another team may be better than you. It seems a lot easier when the results are going your way, but football or sport is not like that. So when you don't win sometimes, when you lose a tittle, when you lose a league, it seems like the end of the world. The bitterness of that defeat lasted two years. Barça didn't win any titles during the '86-'87 season, and halfway through the next, the players rose up against the president over a contractual issue involving two contracts - Federation and image rights. The Tax Office declared this practice irregular, and ordered the players to pay what was owing, as well as some additional fines. The players felt cheated by the club and accused the board. A big scandal. The first squad of FCB out of respect for its fans, who have lost out most because of the disastrous management of the president and board, has been forced into making our thoughts public. If a player doesn't want to be here, they can leave. The doors are open, because our club is above all this and... The struggle resulted in a complete renovation of the playing group, and the return of the man who had revitalized the club a few years earlier, Johan Cruyff, now in the post as coach. He was clear upon arrival - a return to total football, although a revised and improved version, and, above all, the club had to stop playing the victim. What does Barcelona want? To be the best. So if you want to be the best, you have to act like the best. If not, it makes no sense. You can't act as a victim and be the best. That's impossible! So you have to be in charge in every way and to be in charge in football means having the ball. It was considered a revolution at the time, but it wasn't a revolution in my opinion, you just needed people who could do this. Cruyff implemented the so-called "rondo" training exercise. The rondo technique encourages players to avoid losing the ball when they have it, and to steal it when they are in the middle of the circle. Did I invent the rondo? Well, I always practised it because I hated running and that's how it came about. We went from concentrating on being stronger to being more creative and more technical, without renouncing our physical training. More importance was indeed placed on the ball, passing, controlling, the speed of the game, the short game... whereas before we were used to playing more directly to reach the goal area immediately. Cruyff was a great coach. And an amazing understanding of the game and, in terms of... both tactically and individually as a player, you could improve and... he was very thoughtful on the creation of space when he had the ball. You know, when his team attacks, you make the field as wide as you can. When you defend, you make it smaller. And his training was all about possession, keeping the ball, making space for yourself. And he was brilliant. And also, he was probably still the best player in training most of the time. First, you look for the athlete, then make him into a footballer. But we changed all that, because we first looked for the footballer, then changed him into an athlete if we could. It was at this point that Barça began to work with and produce players who weren't very gifted physically, but could play football. One of these young players who could play football with more intelligence than physical strength was Pep Guardiola, who entered La Masía when he was 13. When Johan Cruyff gave him his debut in the first squad, he was 19. Pep became a role model for kids at grassroots football level. Physically, he was a normal guy. He wasn't quick or strong, wasn't powerful at free kicks, but he had vision and knew what to do at all times. He was a bit grumpy in his early days. He got angry with himself, when things went well or when things went badly... He was very demanding with himself. "Why are we doing this?" "Why are we playing like this?" "What happened during that play?" "Why don't we try this play?" He was a real sponge. He went through a sponge stage in his life when he asked questions. Besides Guardiola, there were other key players like Ronald Koeman, a player who handled the ball masterfully. José Mari Bakero, a combative player. Michael Laudrup, who personified the art of dribbling. The electric and powerful Hristo Stoichkov, or Romário, the Brazilian goal magician. Everyone had an enviable individual technique, and Cruyff managed to make them put these at the service of a revolutionary idea. Technique before force. Team play before individual actions. Maintaining possession of the ball to create spaces with which to surprise your opponent. It was sometimes an unstoppable team when it played at full speed and expression. Later it could have lapses and concede a goal or anything could happen, but I've never seen any other team with such blind faith or confidence in its game. Cruyff's team won the Spanish League title in '91. And in '92, it reached the European Cup Final and attracted worldwide affection. But just before the game, the ghost of the lost final in Seville returned. The players had a huge responsibility. The pressure was on us, because the Barça fans were still scared of losing another final like the one in Seville against Bucharest. But we, and especially Johan, were very confident that we could beat Sampdoria. Tension is fine, but not nervousness. Logically, everything around Barcelona in that final had to do with being the victim... Let's see if we lose, let's see who knows what... So I told them this, "I don't know how often you're going to play in a final, so enjoy it and keep laughing not matter what the score." There was extra time. I think it was at the 108-minute mark... Obviously one of my skills is that I'm good at taking free kicks. There was a free kick outside the goal area, about 20 metres out, three or four metres or so from the 16-metre area... So the three of us decided to make that play. We noticed the defensive wall was quite close to the goal, so we tried to draw one of the players out to increase the angle of the shot. We decided it in a flash between the three of us. The referee whistled a foul. I felt as if I could kick a goal, but of course you have to be lucky, because normally the ball hits a defender coming out of the wall. I struck the ball really well and hard towards the left-hand goalpost and the goalie was surprised by its speed. It's something that's really huge and hard to explain, because winning such a major trophy for the first time for Barcelona... It's fantastic, unforgettable, especially for me because I scored the only goal of the match. We arrived at Barcelona airport and there were so many people in the streets... There was over a million people in the streets of Barcelona. I also remember that we went back to Camp Nou and there were still 60 or 70,000 people there. The Wembley hero, Ronald Koeman. [DREAM TEAM TRIBUTE MATCH - 10 March 1999] I couldn't have been happier that day. Football gives you many things, but I've never felt I'm special because I'm a footballer. It's true that sometimes at a certain age you can go a bit crazy, but it's not really me to honestly think that we're gods or something special. [Sant Jaume Square, Barcelona - 21 May 1992] We've simply been lucky to be here and to have won, especially that first European Cup. Long live Catalonia! Long live Barça! Citizens of Catalonia! Now we've got it here! Long live Barça and long live Catalonia! Futbol Club Barcelona had given up on its fatalism. It now had a dream team. It became a recognized club, both feared and admired throughout the world. Two months later, Barcelona's name would echo in all corners of the planet, with its amazing Olympic Games. But that revolutionary dream team fell apart in 1996 after winning four Spanish Leagues, a Spanish Winners' Cup, a Champions League and a UEFA Supercup. Cruyff's coaching period lasted eight years. His final year had been disappointing, with controversial signings and battles with the board. He was first succeeded by the Englishman Bobby Robson, and then another Dutch lover of total football, Louis Van Gaal. If Cruyff had acted by inspiration, Van Gaal was a great example of hard work and method. For Spanian people, it was surprising that a trainer coach was working so hard, more than eight hours in the stadium a day. And not only training, but also in the books, in the videos, making structure in the club. You have to work hard. Not only in ball possession, that I have to go finish. The players have to work also when you lose the ball. It's about rationalisation on the ground. There's a square ground in his square head, positional play, field distribution... He's the perfect schoolteacher. As a teacher, I think he's indispensable. Louis Van Gaal left his mark. He gave the boys from La Masía a lot of opportunities, bringing two great future players into the first squad - Carles Puyol and Xavi Hernández. In Xavi's case, his fate was tied to that of Pep Guardiola, for when he left, Xavi would replace him as the playmaker. Guardiola had already said goodbye to one stage. He had established himself as a key figure in the team, but he didn't feel appreciated enough ten years after his debut, and decided to go abroad. His farewell was on the 11th of April 2001. The fans couldn't understand why a player who'd been trained in Barça for 13 years, a La Masía boy, now wanted to leave when he was at the peak of his career. When he announces that he's leaving Barça, he thinks he can play at Juve, in an elite team, and then finds himself playing with Brescia, a team that's somehow like saying, "Wow, you left Barça to end up in Brescia? No way!" It was all about contractual circumstances. Finally, Juve pulls out of an agreement to sign him and he ends up playing in Rome. It was fundamentally important for Pep Guardiola, the man, to leave home. He felt undervalued by the directors. He felt a sense of adventure and that sense of adventure took him to Brescia, to Roma, and it took him to a league in the Gulf. It confused me about a great player playing at that level. He enjoyed it, so fine. But he tried to play for Manchester United. He was interviewed by Sir Alex Ferguson, but playing for United, even when on a trial, "una prueba", for Manchester City, and they said, "No, thanks." What a strange experience for one of the great, great modern European footballers. Next Tuesday, Josep Guardiola will make the trip from Brescia to Rome for a second drug test after testing positive to Nandrolone after the Lazio-Brescia game. It's another step in his difficult, lengthy battle to prove his innocence. His first reaction was despair, he couldn't believe it. But from then on he tried his best to seek the truth. Anti-Doping Control Committee He said he hadn't taken anything and the body itself produced it. He became an expert in the production of Nandrolone and didn't stop until he reached the courts, where he was acquitted. Guardiola's adventure away from Barça had been very unfortunate. But these difficulties shaped his character, and this would become crucial a few years later, when he returned to the club. An exceptionally competitive nature is essential in order to reach the top, as recognized by one of the best basketball players of all time, Pau Gasol, who was also trained at Barça. It's a question of personality and character in the person and player, your ambition and appetite to remain at a certain level and do whatever it takes to stay there or keep improving. So for me it's a question of mentality and attitude, how you act, how you deal with things, how you focus and the priority you give to this and what you're willing to sacrifice to achieve these aims. I demand a lot from myself and then compete against others and this motivates me because I'm a competitive person. Pau Gasol joined Barça at 16. And with him, the team became Spanish Junior Champions. At 21, he took the risk and made the leap to the NBA, where he quickly established himself as a world star. Gasol had grown up in one of Futbol Club Barcelona's most successful departments. These departments, whether basketball, handball, roller hockey, or futsal, have won countless national and international trophies in all competitions. Throughout its history, Barça has also had departments of athletics, rugby, baseball, volleyball, and ice hockey. And all of them have contributed to increasing the sporting club's fame worldwide. Unlike many other clubs, Barça has never been in the hands of one single owner or private corporation. This is a truly unique fact. It is owned by its 150,000 members, who express themselves democratically and vote to decide on the club's directors and major projects for the future. Unfortunately, the era of Cruyff's dream team was followed by a few years of failed projects, [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS] so the club's members voted for a radical policy change in 2003. [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS] This can be a great day if it leads to the change that I believe the club needs. It was now headed by a group of young professionals launching a new project, with Frank Rijkaard as coach, and a player who encapsulated the magic of Brazil, Ronaldinho Gaúcho. I'll do everything I can to bring joy to everybody. Ronaldinho's first years in Barcelona were really amazing and he sort of ended that situation that we had over several years, especially after the Van Gaal era. These were very difficult periods after Cruyff and it was really like a rebirth, and the person who made it greater was Ronaldinho. The stadium was full and people were starting to wear Barça shirts again. He was a magical player, capable of doing things we'd never seen in the history of football. He did some really amazing stuff, some dribbling on the wing that brought people to their feet. That positive glow and laugh and smile of his were hard to resist for many people. Nobody could resist Ronaldinho's smile. Not even the foreign players, or those from La Masía. But he also brought out of his shell a shy, short, and introverted boy of 17 who would soon become the world's best player... Leo Messi. He had entered La Masía when he was 13, and had continued to make progress. He had the qualities to become better than everybody. Different, small... Truth is I don't really remember, but it must have been in my second year here in Barcelona. His desire to want to be what he ultimately became [La Masia director] was so strong that it gave him a special value, an enormous talent, a desire to win and play competitive sport as if it were a game, a game that he always wants to win, but something that deep down inside is really fun for him. It's true that Barça from the start said that it was relying on him and wanted him and that in the long-term he had to become that amazing player you could already see in those videos when he was 10 or 11. A guy says to me, "There's a kid who plays really well and stuff..." The usual stuff like, "This boy's a phenomenon." Another guy says, "Sure, but he's very small." Then another, "He's a table footy player." So everyone kind of claimed him. Everyone recognised his talent, which was dribbling... "There's no doubts about this guy, you can already sign him." "He's out of this world, this guy's from another galaxy..." He did different things. He was different. All of him. Skilled, fast... He looked so dull and lifeless off the field, but when he was on the ground he became another person. Leo's a guy who came in and was introverted, shy and couldn't play... The club helped him medically because he could barely stretch himself... His family was in Argentina. He could've been vulnerable. Given that he didn't have his brothers around him or his mother close by... It's normal that things would have been difficult for him. It was hard because it was a big change. I was 13 and left everything behind, my family, my friends, my country. Truth is it was difficult. I was lucky to have landed in Barcelona, in La Masia, on a team with great kids who treated me really well from the start. I went to school with the kids from La Masia. I practically spent all day with them and that made things easier for me. The one great positive thing about Leo Messi is that he fought for what he really wanted when nobody could really see it. He fought a lot and dug his heels in and became successful, success in searching, in dreaming... And why shouldn't a boy dream even though he's away from his family? I think I'd like to play football because I love how the chemistry goes through the players, and how you have to work as a team. I think it's really fun. I like the movement and I think that this is what I'm best at. So I'd like to capitalize on it. They pass good, they don't dribble. They take space. If any opportunities, they take them. They try their best. I like how Barcelona passes the ball, and their possession. And how they can make their ball movement, and I know they're a really good team. It's my life. I've grown up with it. I love waking up to it every day... As a good "culé", and as a person who's been here since he was 12, I think it's an emotion. Look how shit-scared I am in this photo. I'm frightened... You feel scared when you sign with Barça, everything seems so big. The club's greatness really overwhelms you. This photo is from my early days, from the first photos of me in Barça. I think we've retained a lot of things from when we were so young and innocent. You learn a lot from life along the way, but you also retain many hopes and dreams you had at that age, which have grown and supported you, and many that have come true. Football is a large factory of dreams. Each year, Barça monitors about 8,000 kids throughout the world, through its extensive network of scouts who travel from town to town looking for players who have the makings. Thousands of videos are viewed, thousands of reports are prepared, and thousands of tests are made of potentially interesting players, but very few receive the call from Futbol Club Barcelona. About 50 to 60 kids are signed from these 8,000. We're talking about a massive filtering process, and not only of those kids that Barça goes to see, but also those presented by parents who believe their children have got enough talent to get into Barça. There are countless letters from kids and parents, thousands of videos on YouTube with footage of athletes... They see it as a unique opportunity, because if Barça is on the lookout for talent, then why can't it be my son? You have to leave a lot of people behind along the way. And when you do let go of one, the father and mother appear, as well as the kid [FCB youth program director, 2005-10] and sometimes the agent at the last minute. [FCB youth program director, 2005-10] And naturally the father asks why, it affects the mother a lot more and the kid ends up crying. Not everyone manages to make it here. It's difficult and it's even harder to remain. Barça's like that, a pyramid on top of which the chosen or the luckier ones remain. And it's cruel because you're a kid, still green. Your emotions are really sensitive. They teach you a little about the realities of life, how competitive it is, those who'll be there next year... It's really tough. Everyone noticed that Messi was very good as soon as he arrived at La Masía. But the board had trouble deciding on whether to sign a scrawny kid, and so postponed his contract. This situation unnerved Leo's parents, because they needed to know if he was staying or returning to Argentina. Until Charlie Rexach did something unexpected. His father and his agent said, "Hey you, they're messing with me." So we had to do something and I tried to calm things down by saying, "Don't worry, I'll fix things up quickly." So we grab the nearest piece of paper and I write down that "as technical director of FCB I agree to sign Messi as long as we discuss the amounts, etc." So I sign it and for my sake had to get down to work. Basically it happened like that, but never thinking that this napkin would become so important. Remember my name, Leo Messi. I was already happy to be here with my two companions and it's a very special day for me. That commitment signed on an ordinary paper napkin would change the recent history of Barça. Messi grew up in the world's best football school, and when it was turn for him to make the leap to the first squad, he did it brilliantly. With Ronaldinho as Master of Ceremonies and Messi as the promising young talent, Barça had a fantastic team, going on to win two consecutive League titles and its second European Cup in Paris. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 2005-06 Stade de France, Paris - 17 May 2006 But after three enviable years of fine play things would not flow as smoothly as before. The press published news of the Brazilian football star enjoying the night life, missing training sessions, and growing a belly. The hangover had arrived after the dream come true of Paris, and Frank Rijkaard was powerless to change things. After the 2007-2008 season, the board sacked Ronaldinho and Frank Rijkaard. Rijkaard was replaced by Pep Guardiola, which came as a big surprise. A year earlier, he had quietly returned to the club to coach Barça B, forming a tandem with his good friend from La Masía, Tito Vilanova. Despite having La Masía's DNA in his blood, very few people trusted in him to perform. Welcome to this season, welcome to your home. Fasten your seatbelts because we're going to have fun. Long live Barça, long live Catalonia and good luck. In 2009, the team won all six titles it competed in. the King's Cup, the League, the Champions Cup, the Spanish Supercup, the European Supercup and the Club World Cup. I've never seen a sustained period of soccer which lifted the spirits, which made the human condition seem so worthwhile, as Barcelona's era under Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova. It was, as far as I am concerned, not about were they better than this era, or better than Madrid, or better than Milan. It simply was something that, if you went to watch them, home or away, you came away with you hair standing on end, with your adrenaline rushing and a feeling that you've been in one of life's great adventures. I don't think there's any question that, for a period of time, Barcelona is the best team, playing the best football on the planet. Guardiola's years, as Messi emerged, with Xavi, Iniesta, Piqué, so many great players, that Barcelona were... And this unique style that Guardiola sort of encompassed, the high pressing, the quick pressing for a few seconds, the ability to keep the ball, the "tiqui-taca", it was just... It was like they evolved the game. When he talks to a group of men, or women, I suppose, he is inspirational, he commands attention, and he commands loyalty. Pep Guardiola unified all those qualities. And that made him exceptional. I don't think he ever pretended to be perfect. One of the things that was a strength of his that... He was on the players' back. On their shoulders. All the time. Any player you speak to will say, "He's a bit too much. He could get right on our backs." And that was good, and eventually it burns people out. But for that short time, Pep Guardiola was a bright burning candle. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 2008-09 Olympic Stadium, Rome - 27 May 2009 Barça experienced a magnificent dream era. It conquered almost everything in four years. Fourteen titles, including three Leagues, two King's Cups and two Champions. A record never achieved before by anyone in the history of football. Unimaginable success, even for his teacher and precursor, Johan Cruyff. There was a person named Johan Cruyff who arrived and changed the philosophy of playing football. He wanted to be a protagonist, get the ball, maintain possession, dominate, play attacking, attractive football, in which people saw themselves reflected in the sense that we really dominated the game. And we've been practicing this for 20 or 30 years, ever since he arrived as coach. Cruyff's period was special... in many ways, because... it was the first time Barcelona had been ultimately successful in Europe. And he did that, and he did it with beautiful football as well, because Cruyff's whole philosophy was about making the game entertaining, and keeping the ball, and making space, and attractive football and great players. And, you know, what Cruyff did was special because he initiated everything that followed. You wouldn't probably have had the Guardiola era with... the Messis, Iniestas and Xavis of this world without what Cruyff did. So in many ways I think Cruyff deserves more credit, but if you asked me which team I wanted to see, the Guardiola team... for me has played the best football I've ever seen. It's not only about just winning, but also how we go about it, and so people admired and still admire us for that. I think that if you look now, retrospectively, to try and identify one leader of the orchestra, one genius, if you reduce it to the coach, you forget about the constant creativity of Xavi Hernández. You forget that, probably, at the tip of the machine there was a cutting edge diamond called Leo Messi, who did things individually that most of us have never seen before. But football is not only a team sport. And that's why it's so reaffirming of the human spirit. It asks disparate people of disparate ages to come together and find a common aim. The key to success of this generation of athletes, some of whom have been there two or three years, like Iniesta, Messi, Cesc, or Jordi Alba and Víctor Valdés... Many of them had played for the same team in lower levels, as kids or juniors... I mean, they knew each other at the age of 13 or 14, they had suffered hardships, they had won some championships, and this unites them. That's the key. Nobody disturbed this spirit, although Real Madrid tried its best to do so. It was logical. Barça was the public's favorite. To reverse this situation, Madrid hired José Mourinho, an old familiar face in Barcelona. Years ago, he'd been an assistant to Bobby Robson and Louis Van Gaal. Then he had began his meteoric career as a coach, ending up at Chelsea and Inter Milan, where he argued against Barça's supremacy with inflammatory remarks. Despite this, he secretly kept an eye on Barça so when he learned that Rijkaard had left, he offered to take over. But the club decided to go for Guardiola, and this upset him. Before Pep Guardiola got the job, José Mourinho unleashed his entire armory to get the job. His agent, Jorge Mendes, burnt the mobile phone of Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano, saying, "My client needs the job, he'll change, he'll play the kind of football you want. Give him the job. He wants the job. He'll be perfect for you." They went, they met him in a secret meeting in Lisbon. He gave a brilliant presentation. It was very seductive. But when they said, "We'd like you to have a different character, as coach of Barcelona, we'd like you to handle the media differently. We don't want to be putting out fires all the time, because you've caused a fight." And he went, "No... this is my way." Because he was angry at Futbol Club Barcelona for not giving him the job when the club had its greatest era of talents. Oh, absolutely, he felt slighted, he felt hurt because of Barça. They rejected him. He lost a battle and that caused him great frustration. Madrid signs up Mourinho to finish with Barça, not to make Madrid better. That's the great contradiction of Madrid, it doesn't know how to stop Barça's growth, so it signs up the person it thinks has the formula to stop Barça. Mourinho went out of his way to rattle and destabilize Barça. With him on the bench as coach, the Clásicos heated up and sparks began to fly. The tension was palpable on the ground itself. The Madrid players ran on to the field to destroy Barça's game with clashes and provocations. The matches became very rough. Even violent. For Barça fans, Madrid was using force to destroy the beauty of Barça's game. For Barça fans, Guardiola was Mozart. And Mourinho, the envious Salieri. The footage of you looking to poke Tito Vilanova in the eye, is this part of the philosophy that you say you're teaching in football? Me? Yes. "Pito" Vilanova? Yes, Tito Vilanova. I don't know what you're talking about. The question you're asking me about "Pito" Vilanova or whatever his name is... no, I don't know his name. No, I don't have anything to say... That's for the referee to say, or the fourth referee, or the TV cameras... I have nothing to say. One day, not here, but outside, a situation will arise that won't be any good. Things will get nasty one day. It's eternal, isn't it? They had Cain and Abel in the Bible. For every good guy, there has to be a bad guy. For every bad guy, to half the audience, he'll look like the good guy. When it comes to football, there's that saying that I use a lot, "It's better to win roughly than lose cleanly." It's like that in football. It's like saying, "We're in today's world, let's win however we can." It's a bit like that. So what happens? Some coaches even today say about matches, "We can't win with the referee they've given us today!" You have a game plan that the referee doesn't let you implement. Bang, he's gone and said it. Do you see? Given that Mr Mourinho has addressed me in a familiar manner, I'll do the same. He called me Pep so I'll call him José. I don't know which is Mr José's camera... It must be all of these... Tomorrow at 8.45pm we'll face each other here on the ground. He's already won off the pitch. I'll give him his particular Champions off the field. He can take it home and enjoy it with all his others. In this room, he's the effing boss, the effing master, who knows most in this world. I don't want to compete with him even for a moment. You'll be the effing master here, but I challenge you on the field. So he challenges Madrid on the field and is lucky enough to win. Why? Why expel Pepe? Why? That's when Mourinho's "whys" appear, because on Mourinho's theoretically ideal stage, which is body-against-body, Guardiola also wins. I think the contrasting styles of Guardiola and Mourinho have been one of the great fascinations of the modern era of football. They're very contradictory. They're both very successful. And, you know, you compare one against the other, these great battles that they've had over a period of time at different clubs. Those years of the lively war of styles between Barça and Madrid evolved in favor of Barça. Among the classic duels of that era, Barça fans remember two in particular. The 2-6 that was played in Madrid in May 2009, and the 5-0 in Camp Nou in November 2010. Here, the Barça players were vastly superior, displaying the most spectacular version of total football, with absolute ball control. But the truth is that those games were just two more battles in a long war between two rivals that lead and sportingly respect each other. I think the two feed off each other. Barça without Madrid might not be as good, and the same goes for Madrid without Barça. When you have a team like Madrid in your league competition, it makes you always want to go to the limit and win every game to win league titles, so that when you go to Europe you've already acquired this mentality and this intensity to win games. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 2010-11 Wembley Stadium, London - 28 May 2011 As would happen a few months later on the 28th of May 2011, in the final of the Champions Cup in Wembley against Manchester United. This was surely one of the team's best games to go down in history. Captain Carles Puyol made a gesture showing how united all the players were. He handed over his captain's armband to Eric Abidal, so that he could lift up the cup in his place. Abidal had been recovering from his first bout of liver cancer. To describe Carles' gesture of giving me the armband... there are really no words. They're the sorts of things you don't see every day in team sports. This is what Barça is all about, it's more than a club, more than a family. Abidal had to fight two bouts of cancer. He seemed to have overcome the first well, but then a second, stronger bout appeared, forcing him to accept his cousin's liver in a transplant that saved his life. Glory cannot hide player fragility, exposed as they are to illness or injury throughout their careers. I proved that I was a fighter and that's what allowed me to have the strength to try once again to overcome my ordeal. As I said, the important thing is to fight. We should never give up, no matter what happens in our lives. We should make the most of our opportunities, whether good or bad. That's what life is all about. Meanwhile Guardiola, the great motivator, the person moving the gears, was fighting against everything, even against his own high demands. His passion and dedication to work, controlling everything, was starting to exhaust him physically and mentally. Nine tenths... of obsession makes you brilliant. But it's that final tenth... which you need to control. When you need to say it's okay to phone a player at home if you think he's out, at night, when he shouldn't be. It's okay to break the rules and say, "Where were you at the weekend? Why weren't you at home?" These things are okay. It won't always work. Some players will do this. But a great manager will try to control. I think everybody got fed up with Guardiola, because he was so demanding, in terms of diet, training, match preparation... This self-demanding culture ends up becoming unbearable at some point. He realised that he'd also lost his influence on Messi and the players, with those talks of his. When you have to come up with a new one every day, they end up not having the same effect, so when that happened he left. At the end of his fourth season and against everyone's wishes, the players, fans and board, Guardiola decided to leave Futbol Club Barcelona, causing a huge commotion. The reason is simple, it's been four years and time wears everything down and I'm worn out. I feel all empty and need to fill myself up again. It's been a high demand. I need to experience that life, that passion, that energy that's so necessary to motivate so many other things, especially your players. There's so much to learn from him. Every man who tries to copy a genius will interpret it in his own way, there is no perfect copy. But the values that his football stood for, the value that his work stood for was... creativity, daring, philosophy, intelligence, style, passion... victory. What more do you want in football? The thing that makes me sad is actually the terrible anti-reaction... by the idiots, the barbarians who were like... "Your football you were so proud of, your football which was so seductive." His football that was the best ever... "Well, it doesn't work now. It was only a product of Pep and Xavi and Iniesta and Messi. Let's go back to playing basic, physical, quick football." Which to me is like prehistoric thinking. But it would be difficult to go back to the rough football of the past. The Barça of Guardiola's era exported his idea of the game to the world, and it was copied and adapted by many others, starting with the Spanish national team, which won two consecutive European Championships and the World Cup in 2010, thanks to its incorporation of a majority of Barça players. Guardiola left after being named the best coach in the world. I want to dedicate this title to Tito Vilanova, my friend, my companion, my assistant. This one's for you, kid. It's for you. Thank you! He was replaced by his friend from La Masía, Tito Vilanova. The style of play created by Cruyff and improved by Guardiola was passed on to good hands. Tito had been his right hand man, playing a much more important role than that of assistant coach. Their relationship was that of equals. They made all their decisions by mutual agreement, so there wasn't that hierarchy of first and second. He was an atypical assistant coach with a strong character, [FCB youth program director, 2014-15] a direct man, a frank man [FCB youth program director, 2014-15] and a man who told you things straight if he had to. And I especially think he was a brave man. You need to have a certain type of courage to join Barcelona... Okay, not courage, but you can't be scared of losing or making decisions, and he wasn't scared at all. SPANISH LEAGUE CHAMPIONS 2012-13 Camp Nou, Barcelona - 19 May 2013 Tito accepted the challenge to succeed Guardiola. It converted his greatest dream into a reality. He did it magnificently well, leading the team to a record 100 points in the Spanish League. Barça continued to win, remained upright with its virtues intact, but personally there was a cooling down of the long friendship with Pep Guardiola. And even worse, a deadly illness appeared that would never leave him. Cancer is always a dramatic metaphor of defeat. The end of a dream. It's hard to talk about if Tito hadn't gotten ill. If Tito hadn't died. However... I think Tito Vilanova was rather the perfect successor to Pep Guardiola. He was perfect for Barcelona. Tito Vilanova and Pep Guardiola were not alike... in almost any way. Their love of football, their shared philosophy of football, their friendship... That made them alike. Their personalities, their appetites, their... visions about their lives... very, very different, I think. And what that made Tito Vilanova uniquely equipped to do... was to help change Barcelona after Pep Guardiola left. Tito Vilanova would have managed to change. It would have been healthier for Futbol Club Barcelona, it would have been healthier for the cantera, but he's been a great loss to Futbol Club Barcelona, a great loss. It was said that Tito's death ended a cycle. But let us not fool ourselves, for the sun rises and sets every day. A cycle ends and another begins. And it all forms part of a continuum, an evolution from that first sun. The first rose with Gamper, a passionate sports fan, a true dreamer. But then others followed in his path, who would shine even more. Barça's heyday was made possible by a generation of homegrown players, by Xavi, Messi, Iniesta, Busquets, and Piqué, with the addition of other foreign players, such as Rakitić, Neymar, and Suárez. As well as another coach whose heart beats Barça... Luis Enrique, who also believes in playing creative, daring football. KING'S CUP FINAL 2014-15 Camp Nou, Barcelona - 30 May 2015 Thanks to all of these people, Barça brilliantly won its fifth European Cup title in Berlin, against Turin's Juventus in 2015. A few days earlier, it had also won its 27th King's Cup, and 23rd Spanish League title. For the first time in history, a club, Barça, has managed once again to win the three major titles at stake in a single season. SPANISH LEAGUE CHAMPIONS 2014-15 Camp Nou, Barcelona - 23 May 2015 Futbol Club Barcelona has dominated world football in recent years, and has triggered the dreams of millions of athletes and fans throughout the planet. The reason Barcelona is what is is... It's not because of Cruyff, not because of Guardiola, not because of Messi, not because of Neymar, not because of, you know, the players in the past, but it's about the club. And it's about the feelings within a club. Not only to play winning football, but to play attractive football. It has an ethos. It's a very special place, a very special stadium. It's one of the great clubs of the world. And it always will be. It's just been a beautiful bonus that, over the last 20 years, it's enjoyed massive success. And brought in great coaches with wonderful players. And they've been a gift to the eye to watch. But it really is the heart of the club that's important. It's about the supporters, los culés. It's about the people that live for Barça and the football club. WE ARE BARÇA Barcelona is more than a club, because of all that it represents, both professionally and at an amateur club level. Barça tries to establish itself throughout the world to leave its mark, how it sees things, how it educates, how it plays football... Trying to put a little of Catalonia in the world so that people abroad can feel how things are here. That's why Barça is great and will continue to be more than a club. I think some people may be still in love with Barça and the Catalan identity. Fine. More than anything else, what Barcelona's modern era has done, it's teaching kids, it's teaching coaches, that football can be different, that football isn't about height, and about power, and about pace. It's about intelligence, and risk, and technique, and daring, and keeping hold of the ball. From a distance, it's now not about Catalan identity or "Més que un club". It's about people saying, "I want to play like that." "I want my son to play like that. I want to win like that." It's amazing and nice to live what I'm living, being on a ground, creating a play, scoring a goal and seeing so many people applauding or saying my name. It's really nice.

I have several. When I was in Rome, the World Cup Final, in London, also the King's Cup at Calderón... I have several. The first year of my career, when I was an 11-year-old youngster, I earned 4,000 pesetas, my first salary. I made sure to get my mum a toaster, as we didn't have one at home. I hope that in a few years time, some of us can be a part of that history. Subtitles by JohnCoffey_09
