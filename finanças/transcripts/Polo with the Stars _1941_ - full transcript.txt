It's the sport of the stars. They go in for pony ballets like this one. And they're packed with thrills and spills. A way back B.C., a few hearty Persians... ...dreamed up a sort of hockey on horseback. And when the game reached mysterious Tibet... ...they named it polo, after their word for ball "pulu." It takes plenty of training to make a good polo pony. Most of the animals are Western bred and Western trained... ...though a number come from South America. A large drove of wild ponies may produce only one or two real stars... ...but there's one in this Texas herd: A young fellow named Pumpkin. It seems a far cry from cow punching to polo... ...but this is the way Pumpkin starts going to school. Kindergarten is in session, with all the Western trimmings. When our hero's been broken to the saddle... ...he's in for a session of calf roping. This'll teach him to obey commands and handle himself... ...with the speed and grace he'll need on a polo field. It develops strong and agile muscles too... ...as he backs off to hold the steer until it's tied. Pumpkin is destined for Buddy Rogers' stables in Hollywood. There, the job is all done. For his higher education, Pumpkin becomes a student... ...of one of America's foremost trainers of polo ponies, Joey Blackwell. First, the instructor must gain the complete confidence of the pony... ...but that item doesn't seem to be giving Blackwell trouble. Here's a man who really knows his oats. After a preliminary maneuver which resembles an old-fashioned waltz... ...he's taught the rudiments of turning or reining. Looks easy but it isn't... ...because a pony's natural tendency is to continually bear to the left. So the trick lies in setting him right. Now we get right down to the serious business of polo itself. That mallet may be a little frightening at first, but after a few hours' practice... ...he doesn't the least bit mind having it waved around in front of his face. Riding off another player is important in a polo game... ...and Pumpkin is given a lesson in this department. Notice how he's learning to crowd with those wiry shoulders of his. Good boy. Watch our hero getting himself out of a tight spot... ...between two oncoming ponies. And his rider takes a good stroke at the ball in the bargain. When Pumpkin graduates, he'll behave like this member of Buddy Rogers' string. He's Mazomenos, an Argentine pony. He belongs to the aristocracy of polo ponies and he knows it. Joe Blackwell sits astride Mazomenos... ...to demonstrate the right backstroke and the right-forward stroke. How'd you like to have a mouth full of silver like this? Jerky side shots don't bother the pony... ...if the player remembers not to follow through. Some car dealers who claim to stop on a dime... ...would turn green with envy if they could see this. Nice going. A few weeks of rigorous working out and Pumpkin'll be able... ...to go through these maneuvers too. There's plenty of spirit in this lad. Notice he always lowers his head for an abrupt turn, a sign of excellent training. The slightest pressure on the rein, the pony must respond immediately. For the delay of a split second might mean loss of a point or even the game. Mazomenos takes to this treatment like a duck to water... ...and he loses none of his agility and fire in the heat of a real battle. Talk about your whirling dervishes. Mazomenos has a few ideas on the subject and he proceeds to demonstrate. And now into a spin. Getting dizzy, Joe? Okay, we'll take it slower so you can draw a deep breath. Observe that in spinning, a pony pivots on his hind feet... ...while the forequarters travel in a wide circle. If you have this equipment and wanna play polo, all you need is a horse. The Thermos bottle, by the way, isn't absolutely required. Let's take a polo ball apart and see what's inside. Well, surprise. Just more of the same stuff. These are made of willow root found only in India and weigh about 5 ounces. For the benefit of you croquet players... ...we might add that a polo ball is not hit with the end of the mallet like this: But with the side like this: Breakfast at the stables. And here comes the cereal. Eat hearty, boys. Now for that morning constitutional. Pumpkin and his pals must take their exercise every day... ...rain or shine, whether they like it or not. And then it's back to the stables for a brisk rubdown... ...a beauty treatment that would make any screen star envious. And plenty of time for a chat before lunch. If it's the day of a game, there's always the ritual of braiding the tail. Hey, what's going on here? Take it easy, that pulls. This hairdo is designed for convenience to allow free swing of the mallet... ...when he's making an especially difficult shot around the stern. Binding the pony's forefeet prevents bruises. The saddle completes the job. Our friend Pumpkin is all ready to go on the field. Game time and players and spectators come flocking through the gates... ...of the famous Riviera Country Club. Here's Pumpkin's owner himself, screen star Buddy Rogers. Like every other sport, polo has its own characteristic attire... ...from boots and shin guards to the distinctive helmet. All designed to protect players from stray balls and mallets. You will see plenty of famous faces at every big game. People like Jack Holden, of the movies... ...and Snowy Baker, the renowned Australian polo player and authority. Tom Moore, star of the silent days... ...and Count Landi, brother of screen star Elissa Landi. Well, how about it buddy? All set for the battle? Okay, let's go. Now, which pony shall we start with today? Personally, if you ask our opinion, we'll take Pumpkin. And Pumpkin it is. Here he comes, along with his stablemates... ...ready for his first big game. Like a number of players... ...Rogers prefers this special saddle covered with sheepskin. Now for a mallet and we'll be all ready to go to work. Just in case you hadn't noticed, four players comprise a team. The game's divided into eight periods, or chuckers, seven-and-a-half minutes each. The object of the game is to drive the ball up the field... ...in between the opponent's goal posts, each score counting one point. All right. Get in and do your best. Here we go. The referee throws in the ball and they're off. At first, it's just a hot scrimmage in midfield... ...with both teams fighting it out for an early advantage. And then comes a flash of action as a long, graceful sweep of a mallet... ...a telling shot, and alert ponies wheel about to follow the play. Pumpkin is certainly getting a taste of polo that is polo on his first time out. There goes the ball again. Flying hooves come thundering down the field. The ball zooms forward and back as opposing teams... ...attempt to break through the enemy defense for a tally. A sudden rush, a well-placed shot and it's good. The ball rolls neatly between the goal posts for a score. Seven-and-a-half thrilling, dramatic minutes and the first chucker is over. Players ride off the field to rest and get fresh ponies. For no mount is used in two successive periods... ...due to the intense strain of the play. Instead, these hard-working little animals... ...are taken in hand by the trainers for a rubdown and liniment bath... ...that will keep their muscles and tendons supple and limber. Few athletes receive better treatment than a polo pony. Protected by coolers, the mounts walk to the stables for a well-earned rest. They've done their work for the present. Well, look who's here. We didn't know Jack Oakie was a polo fan. All right, Jack. Help yourself to a hat and mallet... ...and give us a sample of your game. Okay, Oakie, do your worst. But hold on there. That polo ball looks a little large for your game. Why not start on a golf ball and work up? That's the idea. No, no. The golf ball. Fore. Gangway up ahead. This looks like a healthy drive. Whoa, look at that. Funny how small a golf ball can be. Here we go into the second chucker. There are a number of substitutions among the players. And from all reports, we're in for some surprises. There, the ball is hit. Film star Edward G. Robinson's car makes the score... ...one windshield to nothing. Joe E. Brown has an idea. Come on in, Eddie. Fine thing. Who said those balls only weigh 5 ounces? Well, Joe, you seem to be having a little trouble. The idea is to stay in that saddle, you know. You and that horse ought to get together. Easy, Joe, easy. Or do you like eating your meals off the mantelpiece? All right, Eddie. Let's see how many windshields you can hit. Here's your chance. The ball's coming your way. Come on, Joe. Nice going. Whoever said Eric Pedley is the top polo man around here? That ball is getting nearer to the goal post. What a game. Joe, you're doing all right. We didn't think you had it in you. We spoke too soon. Looks like it's going to be man overboard. Hang on. Hang on, there. That's better. Now to get back into action. Where's the ball? Oh, there it is. Go after it, Joe. Get in there and hit it. No, no. That's no good. Try it again. Come on, old boy, hit it. Oh, too bad. You lost it after all. Eddie is right in there. Guard that goal, Joe. Open your mouth. Maybe that'll frighten them away. The charge of the light brigade. It's going to be too hot to handle. No, Joe's taken it out of the air. Keep hitting it, Joe. Get ready Eddie, your big moment is here. Now, Joe. Just one good drive in there and we'll have it. It's all yours, Eddie. It looks good. The game's over.
