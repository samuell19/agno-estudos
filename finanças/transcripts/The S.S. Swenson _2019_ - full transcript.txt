Able seaman Coughie Swenson. - Where's Coughie? - [Bonnie] I'll get him. [Coughie] Present, Captain Swan! Excellent. Everyone accounted for. [both panting] That's fine. Everyone in the car. [guy sighs] We're off to inquire as to the cost of our vessel. [car engine failing] - Guess not. - Shut it! [soft music plays] [Bonnie] Land ahoy! Land ho! - Is this the spot, Captain? - Looks like the spot, Bon-Bon. - Mm-hm. - I'll stay with the stuff? - Nobody wants your stuff, Ricky. - I mean, it's all of our stuff. Nobody wants your shitty shit, Rick. [all sigh] All right, crew. Rick, get Coughie. First we'll have a quick breakfast time. Uh-huh. [Coughie] Oh, yeah! [man] It wasn't Ray, it was me.

This is my first mate, Rick, and my able seaman, Bonnie. [man chuckles] - How can we help you? - We want a boat. What's the boat for, sweetheart? Healing. We need a vessel that we can sleep on. One bed's fine. First of all, we don't sell boats here. We keep them here, we gas them up, we rent out like a couple. Uh... Okay, look, I know a guy named Terry in Huntington that could help you out. I can write you his address down, but... even like a tight fit, a fiberglass Catalina is gonna run at least, like, four, four and a half thousand. - Yeah, with a hole in it. - At least. Four and a half thousand... - Thank you. - How are we gonna... Thank you, gentlemen. Have yourselves a wonderful day. - Yeah, it was nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. [Ricky] Four and a half thousand dollars... Not a word. Got a lotta, lotta work to do. - Lotta, lotta work to do. - Off we go! [Ricky sighs] Please get the car fixed. Lotta, lotta work to do.

Are you gonna let her talk to your captain like that? - Ricky. - What's up? - You're looking pathetic, mate. - Come on. [Swan] You come on. Every night. Either get the gal back, or don't. - But don't mope. - I'm not. She's better off with you than with that pig Coco. Coco can eat a bag of... - Hey, guys. - Darla, my love. - Hey, girl. - What's up, girl? - Hey, Rick. - Yo. So what can I get for you, guys? What you got? I got Mello Yello, Blueberry Kush... Anything else? See Coco. - So... Mello. - Blueberry. If we're getting Blueberry, then we're getting waffle fries. Deal. And waffles fries. - 30? 20? - 40. Rick, give the lady 40. - Um... - Come on, give it up. It's okay if we crash here tonight? Yeah, you know my dad doesn't care. That lady fucking waving. One second! Waffle fries coming right up. Rick, you gotta go see Coco. - Why doesn't Bonnie go? - I don't mind. We're not sending our little baby sis to a drug den. - His mom's basement. - Look at her, how cute she is. He lives in his mom's basement. [Swan] I think he fancies Bon-Bon. - No. - I do. - Why don't you go see Coco? - That's going to happen. What did we make today? Not a lot. Like, uh, 60 after the beer... Okay, so 45 to the boat, and 15 to waffle fries and the lovely lady's tip. No. There's 20 left after the weed, man. No tip. Tomorrow will be better. Let's go get lovely for these waffle fries, huh? - Yes, Captain! - I'm gonna get ready for sleep. - Night, Ricky. - Night. You did good today, brother. Thanks. Night. Save some for your captain, huh? Give it here. We need to be making more money, Captain. - Tomorrow will be better. - What's tomorrow? - Go to the mall! - No. We can never go back to the mall. Are the walkies charged? - House-hop? - Hmm... While all the little kiddies are at school, and the buzzing bees are hard at work, we shall take the honey from their unguarded little honeypots. [click] [rock music plays] - Okay, come on out. - [Ricky] Copy, coming out now. That was nice and clean, crew. Rick, how was the take? The take... Uh, we got some whisky, and crackers, bread, snacks, snacks, some carrots... - Fuck the carrots. Money, Rick! - Uh, like 40 bucks. - Rick, I said get at least 50. - But there was only 40. - You only found 40. - Captain. No. No, no. One more house it is. - Swan. - That's final. [beeping] All right, last one. - Captain? - [Swan] Yes? - You wanna do one? - The captain drives the ship. - I could do one, Rick. - [sighing] No, it's okay. - You got your walkie? - Yeah. [upbeat music playing] - Hi there. You must be Mark. - Hey. - You're Mark? - Uh, no. I'm sorry, it's been a long day of seeing people. - What's your name? - Rick. You're here for the nanny position, I presume? - Yeah. - Okay, Rick, I'm Jim Davies. You can call me Jim. It's very nice to meet you. [Ricky] Very nice to meet you. Let's talk, shall we? Come on in. Sit your behind down, Ricky. Can I get you something to drink? - Uh, I'm fine. - No, I insist. How about a glass of lemonade? - Uh... - Sit, sit. One moment. Lemonade's all right? Yup. [Jim] Are you hungry? - Uh, no, thank you. - You sure? What are we talking? [Jim] I made a blueberry pie last night. I've got a ton leftover to get rid of. Sounds good. There you go. Cheers. So, Ricky, did you bring me a resume? Um... No, just me. Oh, you know, normally it's customary to... Uh, well, do you have experience taking care of children? Yeah. Could you provide me with some references? How do you mean? Parents of the families you've worked for as a nanny. - Phone numbers. - Uh... No, that wouldn't be possible. - I'm sorry, I don't understand. - Okay. Pie's real good. Why can't you give me phone numbers? Because they're... they're dead. Who were you nannying for? Well, my brother and sister and I, I guess we kind of nannied each other. Oh, I'm sorry. Your parents passed? Yeah. Well, my adoptive parents. When did they pass away? If you don't mind me asking. Well, my dad, recent-ish. Like two years ago. And I don't remember his, uh... My mom. - I'm so sorry. - [Ricky] Yeah. That's really tough. So the position would be a full-time live-in situation where you would stay with us overnight Sunday through Thursday. - Are you a student? - No. Great. So I leave every morning on weekdays at 6:00 a.m. Your duties throughout the day would be to prepare meals for Cookie, make sure he's ready for school, walk him to school, and then just... His name's Cookie? - Yes. - You named him that? No, his mother was an unusual character, she... May she rest in peace. - [Ricky] How old is Cookie? - Fifteen, turning sixteen. You want me to walk him to school? Um, he's been going through a rough time lately. - Kids pick on him? - No, nothing like that. It's... His father... My partner, Bob, passed away a month and a half ago. And we've both been dealing with it, but he's young, and so obviously he's really having a difficult time. I bet. I know he can walk to school on his own. It's just he refuses to talk to a grief counselor, and I wish I could be here for him all the time, but my job is very demanding, and now I'm the sole provider. [chuckles] And I don't mean to dump all of this on you. No, it's fine. Go on. Thank you. Uh... It's just that's the situation, and I wanted to be upfront about it. - That's hard. - It is. Um... Bob was a... a great father. He looks real nice. I'm sorry for your loss. [door opens] Oh, that's Cookie now. [door closes] Hey, guy! This is Rick. - Hi. - Hey. Rick might be taking the position of nanny that we talked about. Why don't you show him around the house a little bit? Okay. Come with me. - So... this is my room. - You really like movies, huh? Yeah. I have this pretty cool camera. My dad gave it to me. Well, it was my dad's. - What is it? - Uh, eight millimeter, you know. Shoots film. Pretty cool. - [Ricky chuckles] - Yeah. - That's cool. - Yeah. Actually, let me go show you my dad's room. Okay. [Cookie] Jim's kept it the same since. My dad was paranoid. He did lots of weird stuff. What kind of stuff? He would hear things and he'd call the police, and they'd come over, and Jim would cook, and we'd all eat. Cops too. - It sounds funny. - Yeah. He talked about nuclear war a lot too. Scary stuff. He was always preparing for the worst. Let me show you the guest room where you'd be staying. Whoa, I'd sleep here? Yeah. This would be your room. [Ricky exhales] Ooh... Yeah, that's comfy. This room's just empty? Yeah, it's our guest room. - It's a big house, man. - Yeah. [Ricky sighs] - I gotta go. Um... - Okay. - Thanks for the tour. - Yeah. [Ricky] Well, it was nice to meet you guys. You as well, Ricky. I think you're a good fit here. You want the job? - Yeah, I do. - Great. Let me have your number. Um, I actually gotta get a new phone. I... No worries. I have a business card. Just follow up with me in a couple of days. Sounds good. - Okay. Bye. - But wait. - We didn't discuss compensation. - [Ricky] Oh. I was thinking 400 dollars a week, obviously a room to sleep in and full fridge access. - Are you okay? - What happened? I might've gotten a job. - What do you mean? - A nanny job. - What are you talking about? - The guy in the house, Jim, was looking for a nanny for his kid. The guy whose house you were gonna rob? Yeah. - Well, that's crazy. - [Ricky] Yeah. - Are you gonna do it? - I'd like to. Rick, we need to stick together and focus right now. We're doing something here. It's critical that we remain as one. - The boat. - Yes, Ricky. I mean, I'd be making money. - How much? - [Ricky] Like 400 a week. We'll talk about this later. - I mean, 400 a week. That's... - No. I'd be able to steal food and feed all of us. - No. - And there's a bedroom where I could sneak you guys in, I was thinking. - No. - No? It could be fun. A bed would be nice. - Yeah. - Who's the captain here? Do captains sleep in diners? Yeah, I don't wanna sleep in the diner anymore. We don't always sleep in the diner. I don't wanna sleep in the fucking car either, man. We could all cuddle. Yeah. When's the last time we all cuddled? - It has been some time. - Well, he just wants to cuddle. Yeah, just wanna cuddle. Come here. [sighing] We'll try it out. Now, I don't want to talk about this for another minute. - [Ricky] Okay. - It is time to play.

You know, I just wanted to play guitar, you know. You don't have to lie to me. I don't care. - No lies. Sorry. - It's all good, man. When I was in high school, I used to lie to my dad all the time. Me and my brother and my sister... we'd make up field trips that didn't exist. We'd make up permission forms, everything, the whole bit. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. Lots of stuff like that. But I... You know, uh... I don't know what you wanna do when you grow up, but if you do your homework, you know, you'll have a couple more options, you know? Like if you wanted go to that movie school, you're gonna need some grades. [Cookie groans] Yeah, you're right. My dad used to do my homework with me. That's a... That's a pretty cool dad. - Yeah. - I could do it with you. - I didn't bring it home. - It's cool, man. No homework tonight. Tomorrow. - Okay. - Cool. [pan sizzling] [Jim] Hey, Rick, you got a minute? Hey, Jim. [Jim] Hey, Ricky, did I wake you up? - Um, no, uh... - [Jim] Can't sleep? - I'm fine. - [Jim exhales] - [exhales] - [Ricky] What... [Jim] Hey, you know, before you came around, I was sleeping on this bed. - [Ricky] Yeah? - It was weird. - [chuckling] It's still weird. - Yeah, I bet. - What's... What's up? - Oh... I haven't been travelling in the last few weeks for work, um, because of obvious reasons, but now it's time for me to get back to it. And I know it's short notice, but I have to go to India tomorrow for two weeks. So I need you to stay this weekend and the next weekend. - [Ricky] Okay. - And I'll pay you double. 800? - Sure. - [Jim] And um... Great. [Ricky] Uh, so you leave tomorrow. Yeah. - Actually, today. - [both chuckle] I've talked to Cookie and I told him that I'll try to be back this Saturday before Cookie's birthday. - [Ricky] Uh-huh. - I'll definitely be back for Cookie's birthday on that Sunday. So why don't I just pay you now for this week... Okay, sure. Actually, I'll just pay you for next week up front as well. - Great. - Great. Uh, I'll be right back. - My god, we're gonna be rich! - Shh! He has that kind of cash just lying around? Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. - Captain. - Captain. Shh! So here you go. Here's 1200, and there's some petty cash there as well. - Again, thank you so much. - Yeah, no problem. - All right, I'm off. Goodnight. - Good night. Have a good trip. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Bonnie. Rick's sister. Okay. The door was unlocked. - [Bonnie] Oh, you're Cookie. - Yeah. Oh, Rick's told us so much about you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Who is that guy? That's our big brother, Swan. We're not supposed to be here, huh? I don't mind. Jim's not here. [Swan moaning] [whispering] Come on. Come here. [upbeat music plays] - Ooh, I'm starving. You hungry? - Um, I'm late for class. - How late? - School started at 9:00. Hmm. [in deep voice] His step-father, yes. Oh, Cookie's feeling quite sick today. I think it's in his best interest... - [Cookie chuckles] - ...to stay home and rest. Uh-huh. Oh, thank you. Oh, don't... don't bother with the homework. We'll just have to catch up on that when he's feeling better. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye then. - [Cookie chuckles] - Badda-boom! Badda-boom! This is awesome! Why? You've never skipped before? - Never. - I think it's fine. Have a nice day off. You wanna make breakfast for the boys? - Yeah. - Come on. [whispering] One, two, three. [both] Rise and shine! - [Ricky] What? - [Swan] What is this? Bonnie. - We made you guys breakfast. - Bonnie. It's okay. - What time is it? - 11:00. Shit. Okay, okay. Give me two minutes, okay? And I'll get ready, and we'll take you to school. - Okay, buddy? - Oh, we called the school. - [Ricky] What? - Tsk. Cookie's sick. - What? - Show him, Cookie. [Cookie coughs] So sick. Uh, Cookie, can you give me and Bonnie a minute alone to talk about this, okay? - Cookie, you're fine. - Buddy? What's the problem? Well, Bonnie went and introduced herself to Cookie while we were sleeping and called the school and told them he was sick. You slept in, he was late! Ah! - Jim usually wakes me up. - Well, I fixed it. - Rick, it's my fault. - No, it's not your fault. No, no, no. Nothing is no one's fault. Nothing is wrong. Cookie, you've met my first mate, Rick, my able seaman, Bonnie. I'm Captain Swan of the untimely S.S. Swenson. - Like a boat? - Yes. - You guys have a boat? - No. Not yet. - I don't... - In good time. - Are you a smart Cookie? - [Cookie] I get good grades. - Are you strong? - I don't know. Hit me. Well... he's no Popeye. You guys want me part of your crew? Maybe. You ever kissed a woman, Cookie? We made you guys breakfast. Come on. Come on, it's gonna get cold. - Ooh, you can cook? - A little. Not really. - [Swan] Excellent. Let's eat. - Swan. [Cookie] Come on, Rick. Breakfast for breakfast. - Yeah, buddy. B-4-B. - [Bonnie] Come on, Cookie. [Cookie] B-4-B! This feels wrong. You said his dad passed away. Just like our papa. - Yes. - Does he have friends? Well, he said that for his birthday, he wanted go to the movies just me and him, so... No, I think I'm his only friend. - When's his birthday? - Two weeks on Sunday. So the kid takes two weeks off school. His fucking dad died. Let's help him out, show him a good time. - And he could help too. - How? - Hmm... I don't know... yet. - I'm gonna get fired. No, no, no, no. It'll be... our little secret, hmm? Yeah. Cookie, this was quite the breakfast. - Bonnie helped. - [Swan] No, no, no. Bon-Bon makes a good little brekkie, but nothing quite like this. I could get used to this. Cookie... how would you like to be resident chef of the S.S. Swenson? Sounds good to me. I just still don't really understand what it is. We're a crew. A family and a tribe. We have a papa-shaped hole in our chests just like you. We've been filling that hole with just about anything we can get our hands on for some time, with no end or answer in sight until... the idea of a boat. The long and short of it is, we raise the money for the vessel, buy said vessel, and then set sail and live the simple life at sea until our vices have left our bodies and we're at peace with our loss. - Vices? - [Swan] Hmm. - Filling holes? - [Swan] Hmm. Do you mean you guys do drugs? Hypothetically. But drugs are bad. Don't do drugs. I smoked a joint once this year. - Did you now? - [Cookie] Yeah. Cookie! Looks we've a lotta lot to learn about you, Cookie. - Welcome aboard, chef. - Chef Cookie. So... how do I get started? I don't know, man. I don't like it.

I don't know yet, I thought we could make it together. Hmm, I like it. We'll discuss later. Run along to class. - [Cookie coughs] - That a lad. - Ricky. - What's up? What's up? What's up? There's no money left. There's 40 dollars in the drawer. - I thought there was a 100. - I bought groceries. Groceries? Well, now we have no provisions. I gotta keep the fridge full, man. I'm the nanny. What about shnarff-shnarff, huh? - We'll get money. - We could sell the microwave. We could, we could. No, we already gotta replace the TV, okay? Okay, well, the day is young. Bonnie, are the walkies charged? - Yes, Captain. - House-hop. Let me sleep. While all the little kiddies are at school, and all the buzzing bees are hard at work... Okay, okay, okay, I'm up. - [beep] - [Swan] Okay, bud? [Ricky] Yeah, all the rooms. Coming out now. Thank you. What else did he get? A lot of stuff in here. Ooh, is that a hat? [video game music playing] Rick, you've got company. There's a guy at the front door. - Rick, someone's home! - Shit. - Rick! - [Ricky] What? - Oh, he's in the basement. - I know that. Fuck. Rick, someone is home. - [Ricky] What do I do? - I don't know. I don't know. Where are you in the house? [Ricky] I'm in the back now, but there's no way out. Where are they? [Ricky] In the front of the house. - Shit. - Uh... [Ricky] Start the car. - [Bonnie] What? - [Swan] What? What? [Bonnie] That's him, that's him hanging out. He's jumping! Woah! Come on, come on, come on! Oh, Jesus Christ, Rick, you scared us. [Swan] You okay, mate? - Guys, check this out. - Holy fuck, Rick. - What? - Ricky got us a gun. - Oh, mama. - [Bonnie chuckles] - Throw it in the trunk. - What do we do with it? - We'll take it back to Cookie's. - No, we can't take it there. I was thinking we could sell it. Sell it? God gave us this gun, Ricky. We'll take it back to the old house. - What, you want to go back home? - You got a better idea? - What else did we get? - A bottle of whisky, a couple of cool sweaters, uh, some crackers, uh... A gun. A gun! [all] A gun! Gun! Gun! Gun! Gun! Gun! - Gun! - [car horn honking] [wind chimes] - I'm hungry. - Let's get the fuck out of here. [mellow music plays] - Swan, can I ask you a question? - [Swan] Hmm... [all laugh] Chef, it's my understanding that your birthday is coming up. - Yeah. - When's your birthday? Sunday. I thought we'd throw you a little early birthday party. - Sounds good, Captain. - Spread the word. Well, I don't know how many people would show up. - Why not? - We could just party, just us. Brilliant, but, but, but... I did meet one likely candidate at the grocery store. I think he will fit right in. His name's Brad. He's wonderful. Sounds awesome. When's Jim getting home? - Sunday. - Perfect. So what's this film we're making? Well, I was thinking we could make it about our crew. We could call it The S.S. Swenson? - I dig that. - Hmm, hmm... No, no. The First Voyage of The Untimely S.S. Swenson. - Yes! - Yes! - That's it. - Okay! We have a party to plan. And a movie to make. - Nay, a film to make! - [Cookie chuckles] - A lotta lot to do! - [all] A lotta lot to do! [Bonnie humming] [Cookie vomiting] [toilet flushing] [Bonnie continues humming] [Swan] What were you doing? - What? Changing why? - No reason. [exhales] [Cookie] Ah, just a minute! - Wanking wanker. - Dibs downstairs. I gotta pee! Ahoy! [zipper unzips] [toilet flushing] [door opens] - Morning. - [Cookie] Morning, Captain. - Saw you peeping. - What? - Peeping at Bon-Bon. - I was just... [chuckling] It's not a big deal. [Cookie exhales] Don't tell Bonnie. Your secret is safe. Speaking of which, I stumbled upon a little safe in your pop pop's room. - What's in it? - Um, money and stuff. - Jim has the key, I don't. - Just curious. You ready for the party of your lifetime tonight? I'm still getting over last night's party. Well, had to celebrate our little film we shot. I can't wait to put it together. - Make me look good now. - Of course. I threw up. Out with the old, in with the new. [soft music plays] Hello. Hello. I'm a little lost, Papa. Fuck. Fuck. [sniffs] ♪ Tada ♪ Oh. Let's get you to bed, boy. Okay, okay. I feel like a pussy. I can't drink like those guys. You're 15, man. You'll be more of a man than those two animals. You guys party a lot. Yeah, well, we're gonna stop once we get the boat. - Hmm, whose idea was the boat? - Swan. - Can I ask you something? - Sure, hun. Why does he talk like that? [imitates Swan] Swan went to school in Cambridge, studied English. [normal voice] And kinda came back like that. [Cookie laughing] So he's, like, faking it? I would not say that to him, darling. He just didn't get a job when he finished school? He didn't finish school. He came back when our Papa Bear passed away. - He just dropped out? - [Bonnie] Hmm. - [Cookie] And then what? - And then here we are. Are you gonna go to school? I will, for art. - To be an artiste. - [Cookie chuckles] - After the boat trip. - [Cookie exhales] I'm coming on the boat, right? We need a chef, don't we? No, that's what I was thinking. [chuckles] [knock at door] Oh, dude, I thought I was coming into a nose party. [Ricky] Sorry. You still smoke that shit? [Ricky exhales] A lot less. This is you sorting yourself out? You'd rather be doing whatever this is you're doing than... - ...in San Fran? - No. With... With me? - We could've been together here. - [Darla snorts] I don't want a cracked-out bum for... Coco is a fucking cokehead. - I don't give a fuck about Coco. - No, he's a... [knock at door] [Swan] It's the police. Open the fuck up! [Ricky exhales] Who's in the mood for a sing-along? - [Ricky exhales] - Jesus, who died? Not to be a downer, but... when you were going through that stuff with your dad passing away... [sighing] I don't know. I just feel like I haven't dealt with it at all. I'm still working through it, man. - How long's it been? - To give you an idea... [puffs] I shaved my head when it happened. - Shit. - Yeah. Little over two years. - Cookie? - What? - Where's your mom? - I never... [exhales] I don't remember her. - Really? Um... - She was sick. Oh, Cookie, I'm sorry. I don't remember my mama either. Maybe both our papa's were seeing the same mama. - Maybe. - Maybe. You're so like us. Oh, fucking... Tsk, the chances. That papa-shaped hole Captain talks about? - Mmm? - It's bigger than me. Oh, you're big, you'll see. You're gonna be a hotshot movie director one day. - What's up? - [Bonnie] Sup? We're doing sing-alongs in the living room. [Ricky chuckles] Do we still have the bald cap? We found the wig. Yeah, we should. Check the big pack. - You okay, bud? - [Cookie] Yeah, yeah. [Bonnie] Oh. [chuckles] - We love you, buddy. - Oh, I love you, guys. Yeah. - Okay. - Let's go. [Ricky] Yes, Captain. [Swan] Have fun, lovebirds. - What's that supposed to mean? - He's being a loser. Oh, no, my sweet paintings, my sweets! - Are they okay? - Yeah, they're all right. I should take better care of them. Why do you have all this stuff? We've carried it everywhere with us, you know, before we started crashing here. - Where did you guys live before? - Kind of all over. Well, Darla let us crash at the diner a lot.

[stammering] We had a birthday party for Cookie. Who's 15. Yeah. So... So you had a bunch of fifteen-year-olds overdrinking in my house while I was away and God knows what else. - Jesus, Rick. - Listen, it was... We were um...

[Jim] Get out of my house! [whispering] Please. This is a job, Rick, and you are fired from this job. I didn't hire you to be his friend and help him. I needed you to be an adult, not the teenager who throws the party. I'm sorry. Look, you're not a bad kid, but you're a kid. And I clearly used bad judgement in hiring you. You know, I've just been so zapped dealing with everything, I've been fucking drained. It has been hell, and I needed someone, I need an adult to help me support this home... - Jim. - Cookie, go to your room. Jim, it's my fault. Cookie, I need you to go to your room now. Is Rick going away? - [Jim] Cookie. - Is Rick going away? Cookie, do as I say. I'm not gonna say it again. - You're not my dad. - Cookie. - You're not my fucking dad! - Cookie, stop! Look, Rick, just get your stuff. I need you to let me deal with this, all right? It appears we have a quarrel amongst us. Fixable, I am sure. You must be Jim. It's a pleasure. Is the pleasure all mine? - Come on! - He's just upset. - I can get through to him. - [Ricky] Bonnie, open the door. - I'm telling you. - Get in the... Open the door. Get in the car. Come here.

[Ricky] To get money to get fucking wasted. For all of us. [Swan] You're the one who left your family, abandoner. Stop saying that. Bonnie, let's go get our money back. We just did. - You guys got the money? - Yes. Did you take his shnarff-shnarff too? - No. - [Swan] Why the hell not? - Because we don't wanna be... - None? - [Bonnie exhales] - You're an asshole. I wasn't talking to you, abandoner. - [Bonnie] Swan. - I don't wanna be a bum anymore. Oh, so you're too good for us? No, I don't wanna be a fucking junkie with you.

I'm sorry. [sobbing] You're fucking poison, man. Listen, I know you love us, and you're trying to help us, but you're too fucked up to lead us out of this shit man. Rick, the whole point is to get the boat, and to get better... Where's the boat? Where's the boat? - Where's the boat? - Boats are expensive. You don't need a boat to get better. It's procrastinating. It's a fucking excuse. Rick. You're my big fucking brother, man. Ricky. What do you want? I'm going to San Francisco tomorrow. You're welcome to come with me. You're welcome to stay. I don't give a shit. I'm taking the car. It's mine. You guys can have the house. I think you should sell it. I could go back to school. You could finish school. This is a lot. It's gonna have to be a lot, man. To get from this bad to good, it's... it's... It's gonna have to be a lot. It's not gonna happen gradually, you know? I don't wanna spend one more fucking day feeling like this. What do you think Dad would think of all this? - Not good. - We have to make things right. - How do we do that? - We have a plan. [sighs] You know all I ever wanted was for us to get better? We know. [Swan] So what's the plan? Hey. You got a second? We'll go for a walk? I have ten minutes. That's plenty. I can work with that.

I'm ready. It is time for us to embark. Let's go. [Swan] Alas, my friend Cookie, I have some news that aches my heart to have to tell. The time has come for us to journey on and cleanse ourselves of our monsters, but you cannot accompany us, I'm afraid. - Why? - [Swan] Because... That's not fair. I have an apology to make to you. As your captain, I led you the wrong way, taught you the wrong things. The truth is... The truth is, when you have a papa-shaped hole in your chest, nothing can fill it. You can stick booze, drugs, cigarettes, anger, and mischief in there, but if you do, how could it ever close up? How is it supposed to heal with all that... shit in there? The only way it can close up, it can heal... is to let it heal. Slowly. And boy, will there be a scar. There will. But it will be the shape of your father, and the sign of his everlasting love. But I'll miss you, guys. You will see us again, when we're capable of good. - We love you, Cookie. - We do. - We love you, buddy. - We love you forever. You know who else loves you? Jim. Loves you more than anyone else in the world. And he needs you right now. And you need him. A tribe. Just like this one. - Okay. - [Swan] Okay. Time for goodbyes. We'll see you soon. [Ricky sighs] All right, it's time. [boat engine roaring] [birds chirping] [car engine starts] [rap song plays] [accordion song plays]
