According to the famous novel by ALEXANDER DUMA-father. Caderousse ALEXANDER RINGEO. Fernand ANRI BOSK. Noirtier JACQUES BOOMER and others... Carcotte LIN NORO. Morel CHARLES GRANVAL. Producer: ROBERE WERNE. Composer: GOD DEZORMER. The novel by Alexander Dumas-father had undeniable success, despite some overabundance of romance, according to some. But such as they are, like it to someone or not, these characters have become historical. It was in this spirit that we revived them on the screen. December 1814 year. "Pharaoh" returns to Marseilles. During the transition, the captain dies. Edmond Dantes takes command of the command. He returns to his father and his bride Mercedes. Before his death, the captain instructs Edmond Dantes secret mission from the emperor to his supporters. Envious of the success of d'Anthes, Caderousse with Fernand's complicity, in love with Mercedes and rejected by her, informs the royal prosecutor about the landing of Dantes on the island of Elba. In the evening of his engagement, Dantes is arrested. The letter seized from Dantes is addressed to Noirtier, a retired officer and the father of the royal prosecutor, M. De Villefort. To save his father, the prosecutor burns a letter and throws Edmond Dantes into the chamber of the castle of If. Being imprisoned for 20 years, Dantes establishes communication with a neighbor in prison abbot Faria. Before his death, he gives Dantes the plan of the island of Monte Cristo, where the treasure is hidden. Faria's death allows Dantes to escape. Smuggled into the sea by smugglers, Dantes asks to land him on the island of Monte Cristo, where he takes possession of the treasures of the abbot of Faria. Dressed as a monk, under the name of Father Buzzoni, Monte Cristo finds Caderousse. From him, he learns what happened to Mercedes, as well as the names of those who betrayed him. He rewards the good, and now, accompanied by a devoted Bertuccio, he will punish the guilty. What a carnival! You missed almost the entire carnival of Venice, this is the last ball at the Countess Graziano. - How, this is the last day of the carnival? - All good things come to an end. Really? Tell me, did you notice that gloomy man dressed in all black? He only shades the fun of the rest. What kind of masquerade, if there is no fatal mask? In the evening of the carnival, all sorrow is forgotten! Sorrow is unforgettable. Join the dance, you will not regret. Your orders are executed, Your Excellency. Thank you, Bertuccio. But which of these dancers - Albert de Morcerf? The young man who lost his mask. By the way, I guessed before they told me. His eyes are Mercedes. "And you want this young man to be evil?" "Are you discussing my orders, Bertuccio?" "Forgive me, Your Grace." "Where are your people?" In the garden. "How many of them?" "Four." - Only? - But resolute. And we are ready to do anything to satisfy you. This is the bench. Colombine will bring his young man here. You hide behind the trees. Do not touch the lady, let him scream. So it is necessary. As for the rest - you know what to do. And how do you lure him into the garden? I got a lady in my game. We will not waste time. We cause too much curiosity. Ladies, do you hear my friend Frank? Do you know where I caught him today at dawn? "Albert, I forbid you to extradite me!" "I will not mention the names." He descended the rope ladder attached to the most famous balcony of Venice! Monsieur de Morcerf! I would like to say a few words to you. Here are my friends, from whom I have no secrets. Speech, monsieur, it's about a lady. "Is she beautiful?" It does not look more beautiful. "What does she want from me?" As far as I understand, nothing bad. Oh, I have a feeling that Albert will lend me a ladder! Is it any more Columbus? She, monsieur. Go on! Gallop! "Forgive me, this time I'm not with you." And where is this lady, Mr. Messenger? "In the garden, near the terrace." The evening starts well! Thank you, monsieur. "Are you afraid of me?" - Oh no. I would like to know what my stranger looks like. What if I disappoint you? It is unlikely. Oh, madam, what an absurdity this ball-masquerade for someone like you! As Mr. de Morcerfa said, the evening starts well. He is so much like Mercedes that I was even touched. Your Excellency, I still have time to save him! Leave it as it is. And he disappeared, and wait for me there, where they agreed. Yes, Your Excellency. - I think I hear the crunching of branches! - Do not worry, we are alone! Oh, monsieur, beware! Help! Save! In the garden, someone is calling for help! In the garden? Over there! Killed woman! No, she is not wounded, but in a swoon. He opens his eyes. What happened to you? Men... a few... They jumped out of the shadows and pounced on us. "Were you not alone?" - No. Who were you with? With the Viscount de Morcerf. "Did they hit him?" "They took him away." I do not know anything! Our friend Viscount de Morcerfa was kidnapped by bandits. And what is important now to find out if there are accomplices of bandits among us? Look, monsieur! Here they demand a ransom of 20,000 livres for him. They must be paid out tomorrow before midnight. Or Viscount de Morcerf will be killed! Is this document signed? Signed "Vampa". "Vampa?!" This is the most terrible bandit of our time! It looks like your unfortunate friend was in very bad hands. We would like to see your face, monsieur. And find out who you are! "It's a perfectly legitimate desire." I am the earl of Monte Cristo. After 20 minutes, the period specified by me expires! I always keep my word. So you know what awaits you. And you woke me to say this?! And I slept so well! You are 20 years old, and you are joking in the face of death. To be honest, I say that I make myself a little. Admit it, do you hope that the ransom will be paid? The amount is too large. Require young 20 thousand livres on the last day of the carnival, dear Vampa, it's idiocy! "You have a rich father." But you do not leave him time to pay. This is a very bad business. I do not need your advice. How do you prefer to die? Hang you or slaughter? "But..." I'm your guest. "Do you want a priest?" Here? Luigi! Come here. Luigi was a monk in Florence. Can help you. Thank you. But I prefer to appear before the Lord without the recommendations of this gentleman. As you wish. Alfredo! Take the gentleman, as usual, since he asked for it. Vamp! "What is it?" Two strangers approached the sentries. They brought a ransom for the Frenchman. "Lead them here!" As you can see, you can find money in the shortest possible time, and do not be an idiot. Let me really hang, if I know where they found 20 thousand livres! We're not late? Just right! Remove the bandages from them. Did you get the money? Gold coins. To avoid possible disputes. My poor Albert! Imagine how scared I was! "Now I can tell you:" Exactly less than me! Where to get this amount?! And if not for the courtesy of the Count of Monte Cristo... Meet the man who saved your life. Viscount de Morcerf. The Count of Monte Cristo. Forgive me, monsieur, that I can not shake your hand. Hardly having heard about your abduction, the count offered his services, To get the Frenchman out of trouble. My father will quickly return your debt to which I climbed. And as for my mother... I can assure you, without stupid boasting, that she will be deeply grateful to you for your kindness towards me. It is with thoughts about her, as well as about you, my friend and I were in such a hurry. The ransom is paid. Mr. Morcerf is free. May I hope that soon you will be in Paris, and I will have the pleasure of introducing you to my parents? I will be at the Opera on October 10, in the first box at the scene at exactly 22:30. I lead you to the Opera, and you are only interested in that empty box! I want to see what the Monte Cristo graph looks like. All Paris speaks of him only! "Some kind of adventurer," interesting only by his absence. After 2 minutes you will lose your bet. I'm so confident in Monte Cristo that I propose to double the bet! Let's. So he that, will not come? I'm beginning to think that this whole story with the bandits was invented by you to extort a ransom from your father. And it's better that he does not show up. It's 10:29 pm. Monte Cristo is famous for royal punctuality. Well, did I invent the story? I owe this person to the life of my son? Undoubtedly! "How is he to you?" Very attractive. Exceptionally romantic! - And Paris will accept it? - With great pleasure. Good evening! "How glad I am to see you in Paris!" And what punctuality! I like to keep promises. I get more pleasure from this than others - from non-fulfillment of my own. My dear Gaydet, may I introduce you to my friend. Viscount of Albert de Morcerfa. "Madame!" Have you left too bad an impression of a trip to Venice? I brought only wonderful memories from there. And the last of them, thanks to the Count of Monte Cristo, was the best! You will not be angry with me, madam, if for a moment I take the count from you, for my mother wishes to express her gratitude to him? Not at all! It's so natural. Madame! My father had a meeting in the House of Peers, but he gave up state affairs for the pleasure of shaking your hand. Mother, let me introduce you to the Count of Monte Cristo. Monsieur, there is a woman in front of you, which does not know how to express your feelings to you. I'm guessing, madam. Besides, why try to describe them? Thank you. To the gratitude of the Countess de Morcerf, I want to add, monsieur, my expression, too. Are you in Paris on the road or are you going to live here? I came to Paris to settle some old business. Which remained unfinished. I do not know how long it will take me. Whatever it was, I bought a mansion in Neuilly, where I hope to see you as a guest, as well as Madame Countess de Morcerf. I will not let you go. I want to introduce my friends! "With great pleasure, my dear Albert!" "Will you allow me?" You are not sick? I've never seen you so pale. It's hot in here... I hope there are no thugs in Paris who need to be afraid? No. It's much more dangerous for Parisians! At least, they treat better with captives. I agree. But the ransom they take is much higher! Dear Earl, may I introduce you to my most worthy friend - Maximilian Morel, Lieutenant of the 6th Cavalry Regiment in Africa. Very glad to shake your hand, Lieutenant. I once knew in Marseilles a certain Mr. Morel, the armorer. Is not your relative? "I'm his son." My father died 8 months ago. He was a man of exceptional honesty and kindness! And... I would be glad to see you at my place, as soon as I settle down in a new place. Your Excellency, I hired you to serve this guy. He worked for the Duke de Tremoy. Excellent. What is your name? Raoul. Raul Kokiyo. I never get angry, I always forgive mistakes, but never negligence. If I find out that you commented on my actions, they followed me, you immediately leave my house. I warn my servants only once. I warned you. Go ahead. Mr. Bertuccio, stay in my office in 5 minutes, we need to talk. Ali, have some more tea, please. You said, dear Gayde, that from our box yesterday did you recognize that person? Yes. I was only 12 years old when I saw him for the last time. But under such circumstances... that the whole scene was forever engraved in my memory. The Comte de Morcerf is the same officer who betrayed my father. But why did your father ask King Louis Philippe to send him a French general? To organize our small army. The Turks threatened to take our city by storm. And the Earl de Morcerfus sold us to the Turks. Who paid for his treachery with the treasures of my father. He will pay even more dearly for all his crimes. But why wait? I am so afraid that when you return to France, you will return to the customs of your homeland. Do not worry. I only dream about one thing - rather return to the Middle East. Only there, next to you. I can forget all the evil that was done to me. When will I avenge myself. The women of my country never challenge the will of the master. But tell me, are we going to stay long in Paris? Well... first we will strike at Mr. De Morcerfa, then by Cadrus, then for M. De Villefour. And... I think everything will be very fast. But I have to go to accept a man who, perhaps, will help me. I'm sorry. I'm in the office waiting for Bertuccio. Bertuccio! I'm waiting for a visit, which is very important for me. And I would really like, so that you avoid meeting this person. I'm delighted that even in this case you do not ask me questions. But I have no questions to your Excellency. And I do not have any secrets from you. The lord I'm waiting for is this is Benedetto. "Benedetto?" "Your son, yes, if I may say so." With the permission of M. De Villefort. But I thought that this canal is now in Toulon? Comrade of hard labor of our dear Cadrusssea? Yes, 10 days ago they were both in hard labor, until I decided to make them escape. But how? "With money!" Send Cadrusse to hard labor cost me a diamond of 50 thousand francs. To get him out of there - in 2 times more. Your Excellency believes that Caderousse was punished enough? Caderousse believes that he was saved. And I... I know that he will do everything, - to be killed. - Killed?! By whom? Come in! Your Excellency, the Marquess of Cavalcanti wishes to meet with you. Who was killed? Yes, the Marquis of Cavalcanti. Excuse me, Your Excellency, but I do not understand. Go in there. I authorize you to overhear our conversation, and you will quickly understand everything. Let him in. Mr. Count Monte Cristo? I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Marquis. My compliments to your costume and blouse, they have not lost their luster. Yes, all this is not bad, but not for nothing. Here, by the way, I have accounts. They will be paid today, do not worry. Excellent, excellent, do as you please. I ask you to. And tell me, Mr. Marquis, Have you had time to learn the names of your dad-mom, uncle and grandparents? Yesterday before bedtime I glanced at my genealogical tree. But before I learn all this, I would like to get a small amount! A! You do not trust... Everything that happens to me is so strange! And mind you, I'm ready for anything! I'm ready to be the son of anyone. I'm ready to learn and repeat everything that you want. But I need money! It is quite a legitimate desire. As you want? 5 thousand francs? "Oh, that's too little!" I'll give you 10. "Oh, I see, I can trust you!" In a couple of hours I'll know by heart all the titles of my dear dad and my beloved mother. Tell me, will I have to meet with them? Never! For myself, I'm not afraid. I can meet with anyone, just to pay. Only it will be necessary to follow his speech a little. Aha. And do not itch without end, my dear marquis. You are no longer in Toulon. - How? Do you know where I was 2 days ago? - I know. And where you were before. And all that you did. I know Bertuccio very well. "Do you know my father?" Then why do you ask me to be the son of Andrea Cavalcanti? Yes, then, that I pay you for it, my dear! This is true. And what should I do for you? For me? Nothing. I ask you just to be elegant and visit all the entertainment places. With friends, who quickly get yourself, with women, with whom you will get acquainted, spending money without an account! But I have only 10 thousand! And monthly you will receive the same amount, do not worry. But then in exchange do you ask for something terrible? I give you my word of honor that I will never ask for anything. Nothing! Am I dreaming? No. Well, have you agreed, my dear marquis? Have agreed. But... since you are such a rich, generous person and such an original, I would like to ask you something. - Aha! - Voilà, I escaped from Toulon with a friend. Could you do something for this poor fellow? Uh, no! Seeing what is happening to me, he will start to envy me! So if you helped him a little... No! But I do not mind if you help your friends yourself. This is your business. My dear Marquis, I give a big ball on the 18th of this month. I hope you will honor me with your presence? My dear count, with pleasure! Raul, you will see Mr. Marquis de Cavalcanti. I was extremely pleased to meet you! Believe me, mutual! Bertuccio! Now you understand, Why would Benedetto be forced to kill Caderousse? I understood. And how will I carry out my revenge against M. De Villefour? I guessed. Your Grace will be for dinner? No, I'm having dinner with my friend Viscount de Morcerf in a circle of epee. Touch! Bravo! Account 9: 2. But I will defend myself to the end! Touch! You are definitely too strong for me. Score 10: 2! "I warned you." You have an unmatched blow! But I'm a good shooter, I suggest to fight on pistols. I can not refuse. But I warn you: I'm even stronger on pistols. Than on swords. The conclusion from all this - I should not quarrel with you. If you cherish your life, it is. Dear Albert, you have a happy view of the winner. The kind of loser who was masterfully taught! Dear Earl, may I introduce you to my friend René Bosham, head of politics in the newspaper "Impartial." The Count of Monte Cristo. You work in a newspaper, monsieur, which I really like its independence and sarcasm. We serve the truth with sincerity and enthusiasm. Undoubtedly. But you dare attack the powerful of this world with such energy, which rather requires not enthusiasm, but courage! I do not know how to thank you for such a compliment! - Dine with us, for example. - In the House of Peers meeting. I have to participate there from the newspaper. Do you think peers of France do not go to dinner? Like them, we'll eat fast, but delicious! Good! It's you? Did you come to dinner? I warn you, herring is the only one. "I'll have lunch in the city." "Do you squander your inheritance?" In my opinion, it's ready. Oh, how handsome! Who helped you dress like this? Er... my friends. I could ask them for pants for me! But did you take money from them? "I did not dare." Then shoot. I'll give it to the merchants, and we'll buy the most essential things. It's impossible! I was invited to the cafe "Paris", I should be decently dressed. And, monsieur dines at the Paris Cafe! Not a bad job! And what will happen to your friend? Do not envy. What is the benefit if we both have trouble? I have a friend who offers to live with him. - Yeah, you're dumping? - For me everything is getting better. It would be foolish not to use. You, too, of course, will fall. Will it fall? You can not spend an old fox! You dug a gold mine and take care of it for yourself! You have always been a beggar, why should this change? Only, baby, I also want my piece of cake. Or you, too, will tighten your belt! You imagine, I could forget how we suffered in penal servitude? It's all words, excuse. Go have dinner, I'll find you anyway. Do you hear? Only in your own interests, that I had what to eat, what to smoke and that from time to time to drink. How much do you want, so you leave me alone? - 100 francs per month. - And if I give them? Will you leave me alone? Let's say, 150 francs on the 1 st of every month, and I'll forget that who you are. Honestly. "You will receive your 150 francs." You are a true friend! If you were a brother, I would give 200. What? You gave me my word of honor! "And really, I forgot!" And when Caderousse gives his word of honor, he never changes his mind. What will you wear today, Countess? What you have prepared. There are two dresses. Pink or blue? What you want. "Is Madam sick?" "How did you decide?" "Madame has changed a lot." The Countess has never been cheerful, but from that day on... from the day you were at the Opera, nothing more pleases you. I'm just tired, do not worry. Come in! "I hope I did not disturb you?" No, but frightened. When you ask me early for a meeting early in the morning, then you lost a great night. No, I did not play. And I need to talk about something else with you. But face to face. I'll call you in a minute, Nicole. What are we talking about? Have you read the newspaper "Impartial"? No, but your father told me there was something about him. A filthy slander! How did your father react? With a smile. This mania - the newspaper furiously attacks all those who are in sight. With criticism. But "Impartial" - the newspaper is unfair, offensive! And not only in relation to the father, but also all, bearing his surname! To you, mother, and to me. So it does not make me smile. In what do they reproach your father in this issue? Neither much nor little, in the betrayal of Ali Pasha in Yanin! Moreover, they hint that the de morseurfa owe their fortune treasures of pasha, which they received for a pittance. Here's how? Your father did not tell me about this. His position in the Chamber of Peers causes so much envy that he can afford to respond with contempt. And I will not allow anyone to doubt the origin of our wealth! We are challenged, I want to accept it! I will not, my child, advise you to be indulgent when it comes to our honor. But what are you going to do? I go to the newspaper to Boshan and demand an apology. And if he refuses... "Your friend Beauchamp will meet you." You're already an adult, to understand what feelings connect me to your father. As a person, he has shortcomings, why I suffered. But as a soldier, he has nothing to blame! That's what I wanted to hear from you. Mother! Trust me! Already tomorrow the newspaper "Impartial" will bring us an apology. "Apology?" - The most concrete! Which will dispel all doubts among readers. Otherwise, I will consider myself insulted by you! My dear Albert, do not start! I repeat to you, the output of these lines has nothing to do with me! You are responsible for the policy of your newspaper! I can not believe you pulled away. You seem to purposely try to deceive me with words. Albert, we are friends with you! "I'm not sure anymore." "Another awkward word." But I will prove my friendship, in spite of you! I will find the source of this unfortunate publication and personally draw up a refutation, in which the newspaper will express its regrets to you. - Regrets and apologies! - And an apology. I am your friend? I will answer this question when I read the article. Give me time to check everything, and in the evening I will present you an article. - In the evening I go to the ball to Monte Cristo. - I also. We'll meet there. Without swords and pistols! With a glass of champagne in his hand. For a couple of months, the Count of Monte Cristo conquered all of Paris! Here all the diplomatic missions. I counted one minister, two generals, one academician, two ambassadors and three peers of France! M. De Villefort! I'm happy, Mr. Prosecutor, that you accepted my invitation, because I have not yet had the honor of being acquainted with you. I did not want to be the only Parisian who does not know the Count of Monte Cristo! And I've known your name for a long time. And I followed with great interest your magnificent career. I admit, I am one of those who have decided to smile. Oh, I do not believe in luck, Mr. Prosecutor. A brilliant success is always carefully prepared. And if you understand what is the basis of the wealth of the powerful of this world, we will get, I think, interesting conclusions. Do not you agree? I think that it is based on the love of work... Love for work - yes. And on decency! You will allow me to introduce to you one of my young friends, Marquis Cavalcanti? With pleasure! Marquis, I am pleased to introduce you to Mr. de Villefort, the Crown Prosecutor, one of the most worthy and incorruptible figures of our time! "Very nice, monsieur." Are you Italian? I am the son of the Marquise Andrea Cavalcanti from the old nobility of Florence, who in 1812 moved to Milan. Francesca Berdizzi, my mother, the daughter of the architect Berdizzi under Pope Clement XIV. My young friend came to Paris to collect documents about his family. There is evidence that one of its branches was entrenched in France. But, excuse me, I must go to the guests. I leave you to chat with each other. The relative you are looking for, he lived in Paris? I do not know! Yes, I do not care! I told the Count that I was interested in something. For me, Paris is interesting games and ladies. Here's how? Those who know the secret Paris, there is always where to have fun! But who am I telling this to? A representative of the judiciary knows best. This joke, the marquis, does not seem to me very successful. Oh, I did not say anything offensive to you. Take a glass of champagne, and I'll tell you what's going on in some houses, so that you had something to see in a dream when you next fall asleep at a court session. Mr. Viscount de Morcerf! Dear Albert, you're late! My mother was unwell, I stayed with her a little. Does this mean she will not come today? She instructed you to convey her regrets. Tell her I was truly upset. Do you know, Beauchamp has already come? Yes. And he informed me about you. He is waiting for you in the small interior of Gayd. There is no other access. "Thank you." Frozen? I did not fire to keep myself warm, but to prove to you how much I am your friend. The meaning of what has been said is eluding me. Have you written an article? - First, as promised, I conducted an investigation. The note that wounded you was written by my colleague Vincent. So easily, lightly, without weighing the severity of what he writes?! No, my friend, on the basis of a special and unpleasant file, which was sent to him... "Who?" The man who concealed his name. That is, by denouncing the first counter the newspaper allows itself to print slander! My dear Albert, I beg you, keep yourself in hand! I saw the dossier, I studied it. I am very calm, and I weigh my words. The role played by General de Morcerf in the surrender of loannina, is unambiguous! Like this? You, Beauchamp? You declare that... "I do not say anything." But in view of the anonymity of the informer and my friendship to you, I suggest you, Albert, throw this file into the fire. It can not be! My father could not do anything dishonest... Here is the dossier. There is no final proof in it. You can read it if you want. But... I would have thrown him into the fire if I were you. To avoid the need to have an unpleasant judgment about the father. Thank you, Renee. Your words - the words of a sincere friend. And if your conscience allows you to destroy these papers... destroy them. Nothing more is left. My father... Father, whom I thought was a good soldier! Let such for you and remains! We'll never talk about it again. And now go. What impression did the Marquis de Cavalcanti make on you? Can I be frank? "Oh, I beg of you." This man is badly brought up. He seemed to me spoiled, vicious, I experienced more to him than antipathy, - something like disgust! I think you are too harsh towards him, Mr. Prosecutor. It has charm... Yes, his upbringing leaves much to be desired... But we must take into account that his father never dealt with them. This does not explain to me its vices. Do I need to explain to the representative of the judiciary with your experience, that a child thrown right into the night of birth - and this is his case - is it not to blame for the fact that he was badly brought up by random people? No! The real culprit - father of a young man, who, believe me, is a scoundrel, which only the world has not seen! "Do you want something?" Thank you, I'm a little tired. I ask your permission to leave. "You work too hard, Mr. Prosecutor!" Maybe. I hope, Mr. Count, we'll meet again. Do not even doubt, M. De Villefort! "Lord Bosham!" "My dear Earl?" Have you been warned that a colleague came to you here in the newspaper? "They did not tell me anything." Yes? This Mr. Vincent wanted to see you, and I decided that it would be better to take him to my office, where he is waiting for you. - That's very kind of you. - You will see, this is a comfortable room and - an important detail - it has a fireplace! "The fireplace?" - Yes. You can make a fire. Go, go. Your colleague, probably, was waiting. My dear, this is not the time or the place to bother me! If I have allowed myself to be indiscreet, it is only because the matter is important. "Could not wait until tomorrow?" No. "What are we talking about?" - About the Count de Morcerfa and the capture of loannina. We brought a new dossier to the newspaper, more detailed. But this time the brothers also have a copy of the documents. Tomorrow morning all the newspapers will talk about this matter. Is our newspaper alone keeping silent, after the first one started? "Are the files with you?" Here it is. Is the informer still anonymous? No. Who is he? I leave you the right of surprise. In solitude and in melancholy at the ball, dear Albert? What's wrong with you? "Lively disappointment!" "Oh, I'm so sorry." Moreover, I think I know the reason? No, no, you are probably wrong. It is unlikely. And what is most distressing for me, you are only at the very beginning of your disappointments. On the contrary, everything will be arranged. Do not rely on it. Your friend Bosham will strike you... a very painful blow, which you do not deserve. I am ready to admit this. I just broke up with Bosham. Go to him, he's in my office. But they do not aim at you, Albert, remember that! And do not take too close to heart a quarrel, to which you have nothing to do. Well? "Impartial" can not remain silent. "So it's right that I warned you?" Yes. Personal motives forbid me to personally engage in this case. I trust him to you. I give you carte blanche. - I am very touched by your trust! Do not waste time, Vincent. The article should appear tomorrow morning on the front page. I can handle! Monte Cristo warned me with an embarrassed air, that you have bad news for me? "Did Monte Cristo warn you yourself?" Yes, a moment ago. My poor Albert, tomorrow morning in all the newspapers will be about this case Yanina. Again? But this time the informer called himself. Tell me his name! I'll trumpet the whole world! Who is he? The Count of Monte Cristo. Is he? A couple of minutes ago he assured me... in his friendship... in his sympathy... But his attacks are directed solely against M. De Morcerfa. Do you forget that I wear the same name?! Follow me. We will find out the relationship before all of Paris! Mr. Count Monte Cristo! I need to tell you a few words! "I'm not used to being interrupted!" "You'll suffer a few times!" Many of your guests do not know who you are. A Greek or a Portuguese, from the East or from America is not the issue. The main thing is that everyone should know that you are a liar and a cunning friend! That's so... My poor Albert, you lose your mind! And I remind you, that in fencing classes you realized that you do not need to look for quarrels with me. I would like to know why you need weapons, If you hit the opponent off guard and in the back! Good. You will find me tomorrow morning in the Vincennes forest in front of your house. This is the last invitation I accept from you! Lord René Bosham and Franz d'Hépine will be my seconds. I would like you to introduce your friends to them. Lieutenant Morel, will you do me the honor of assisting in this matter? "I'm at your disposal, monsieur." Thank you. And you, Mr. Leperier Codru, can I ask you about the same service? "Your choice honors me, Mr. Monte Cristo." Thank you. As you can see, you will receive satisfaction. And I'll take this opportunity, To teach you a lesson for your language liberties. Ladies and Gentlemen! Sorry for this little incident! In fact, nothing happened! And the ball continues! The only trouble with this duel - I have to get up early. Just in case, I wrote a letter to my notary. Tell him in case - unlikely - if something happens to me. "Your Excellency, what weapon was chosen?" Pistols. I'm offended, I'll shoot first. So much the worse for the viscount. I did not warn Gayida that she should not have worried in vain. I'll go back to breakfast and tell her the whole thing, simultaneously with the result. What time is it now? My guests were late! It will be useful for me to sleep for at least an hour. Wake me up. "Your Excellency..." "Come in!" How, Raul, are you still here?! No, Your Excellency, I was going to go to bed when I called. I thought one of the guests had forgotten something. But no, it was a lady. "Lady?" - Yes. I tried to let her know that it was not the time for visits, but she insisted that I did not dare to send her away. "And she did not name herself?" No. She just called her name... - Mercedes! - A... Well, let this lady in. And you, Bertuccio, leave me. But do not go far, maybe I'll need you still. "Just call, Your Excellency..." Good. Go on. After the incident tonight, I'm surprised, that the Countess de Morcerfa is paying a visit to the Count of Monte Cristo! Let's leave the topic that hurts me. I recognized you the first time! If the Countess de Morcerf and the Count of Monte Cristo should avoid each other, then Mercedes has the right to ask Dantes to save her child. Dantes is dead, madam. You wore mourning for it, and then you forgot it. It is not true! You can not imagine how I suffered these 20 years! I need a terrible revenge! And now, when it is done, do not ask me for pity. Then beat the guilty, but spare the innocent! Albert did not do anything to you. And all that I did to you, - I loved you. When you were young, I adored you! When I decided that you were dead, I loved the memory of you. You say your life was broken? And my - is not it? I was never happy. Life gave me only one joy - my child. A child who was supposed to be yours! And you came back only to kill him?! If I do not kill Albert, he will kill me. First I had to talk to you. I do not ask anything for the Count de Morcerfa. I stayed the same, Edmond! The one that put honesty and kindness above all else. If his wealth is not earned fairly, I will give up my share. If he stole his glory, I will stop wearing his name. But you, Edmond, be fair! Right? You! You were waiting for me? I waited for you 3 years! And only when they told us that Dantes had died, I finally agreed to marry my cousin. A man who did not hesitate to blame the innocent of a terrible crime, sending him to rot in the cell, really deserved your respect and your love! What do you want to say? That I was sealed in the castle of If by the anonymous denunciation of your cousin! It's impossible! I know all the faults of my husband, but he is not a traitor! Ah, Mercedes! This is the generosity that I liked about you so much... how it blinds you! Only your husband's career, his wealth, even his marriage - everything is based on deception, betrayal... Everything! Therefore I ask you, at the time of his payment for his crimes do not raise his voice in his defense, the only voice in the world that can still touch me. I came to ask you not for my husband, but for his son! If the voice of Mercedes still can be moved by Dantes, spare my child! Do not be afraid. I'll shoot first and I will miss. Ah, thank you! If Mercedes has aged, if her youth - just a memory, you will soon find out that her heart has remained the same as you liked. Farewell! Called, Your Excellency? Yes, to remind you of my instructions. If an accident happens to me tomorrow morning, you will immediately carry this letter to the notary. I appointed you the executor of my last will. And I have no doubt that you will serve me after my death as faithfully as in life. But, Your Excellency, you shoot first! Nothing can happen to you! Duel, Bertuccio, - this is a very delicate matter. It's too late, Your Excellency, you should rest. No. I'll go to Gayd. Your Excellency wants to warn her? No. But I want to see her. Perhaps the last time. Gentlemen! Here are the pistols. New ones, I took them from Gossec. Want to check it out? - It's enough to know that they are not familiar with rivals. Naturally. What time is it now? Five minutes to eight, gentlemen. And here is the Count of Monte Cristo! I beg your pardon, gentlemen, that I disturbed you in such bad weather... Did you have time to rest a bit? - I feel good, calm... - And condescending? What are you implying? "No matter how great an insult," all your friends want you to spare this young man. A simple wound is the only lesson he deserves. And when the Viscount de Morcerf aims my gun at me, do you think he will spare me? Certainly not, if I read the morning papers. In all the treachery of the Count de Morcerf in loannina is described. It seems to me, it is better for us, gentlemen, to rely on providence. And here he is! How, you in the same outfit? Did not you go to bed? Why did I give you advice? Friends, you came here to assist me, and not to be convicted! If you are looking for death... I came here to do what's even more painful than die. Franz! Tell the count that I'm going to tell him a few words. "Alone?" - No, no, before all. Go ahead. You're not going to start insulting him again?! "Did you read the papers?" Alas! But this is another matter. I beg you, do not be angry! I know better than others what I should do. Monsieur, do you want to tell me something else? Yes, monsieur. Last night in the presence of your guests I made up your portrait, which is not accurate. I reproached you for persecuting my father, but I did not know then the motives for your behavior. Now I know them. I have no right to reproach you for anything. And I ask you, Monsieur, to accept my apologies. In this case, I ask you to forget about our quarrel. And... I give you my hand. I think my mother would be happy to see us at that moment. Tell her, Albert, my appreciation and... my deep respect. As for the truth about the Yanina case, not here, not on this field it can be installed. Today the Chamber of Peers will hear explanations of Mr. de Morcerfa. In the face of such serious accusations, nominated against one of its members, The Chamber of Peers asks Mr. De Morcerfa will be explained before the assembly. You have the floor in your defense. Gentlemen! Who I - you know. I participated in 3 military campaigns. An unknown soldier, I earned all my awards under enemy fire! And King Charles X made me Count de Morcerf. And who is standing up against me? An alien whose real identity is unknown to the police. A man, of whom we only know that he is very rich! Who conquered Paris, exhibiting his wealth on display, the origin of which no one knows! Who do you believe, gentlemen: The French officer or this adventurer? But let's move on to the facts. Sultan Ali Pasha was besieged by the Turks in loannina. He would surely be deposed. Sultan, trusting me and friendship, instructed me to negotiate an armistice. I gave him the terms that he rejected. Before he resumed the battle, he embraced me. And a few moments before his death he handed me this ring: As a sign of the transfer of command and its eternal gratitude. Here, gentlemen, how I betrayed the Sultan! Did this last conversation have witnesses? Yes, Mr. Chairman! The Sultan's wife and his daughter Gayde were present, sobbing, at this last meeting. Ali Pasha entrusted their fate to my hands. Alas, the Turks, storming the royal palace, ruined before my eyes the unfortunate sultan and her child, despite all my efforts to protect them. And there was not a single living witness to this scene? No one! If only this graph of Monte Cristo did not hide under the table! But I doubt that this character ever happened there, where not gold is picked, but you can get a bullet! Gentlemen! Before moving on to a vote that the whole of Paris is looking forward to, I must inform you that the witness described by the Count de Morcerf of the scene proposes to hear it. "What witness?" I give the assembly the honorable word that there were only sultans, sultans, their daughter and myself! I ask the assembly to let me know by raising my hand, Does she want to hear a witness? Who is against? Enter the witness. Come here, madam. And tell us who you are? Gayde, Princess Yaninskaya, the daughter of Sultan Ali Pasha. Which was issued to Turks by the betrayal of this man! The Sultan's daughter was killed! Mr. Chairman, here are my testimonies of naming and birth, and, strangely enough, the act of sale and purchase concluded with an Armenian trader, on which me and my mother were sold into slavery for 100 thousand francs, paid to this person! "Lie and slander!" All this is not true! "Mr. Morcerf, the word to the witness!" Speak up, madam. When Yanin was surrounded, my father sent the general to the Turks, to negotiate a truce. The general, having retreated from his mission as a negotiator, gave them the city plan. A few moments before death in battle, my father called the general. And on our mother's eyes he hit him in the face! The general was pale, like now! Here, look at him! He has my father's blood on his forehead! This gesture accuses you, M. De Morcerf. What can you say in your defense? What can a person who has fallen into a network of lies answer?! You told us yourself that the wife and daughter of the Sultan died before your eyes, despite your efforts to protect them. And here is proof that they were sold to you by a slave merchant. I protest! The Chamber of Peers does not have the competence to judge this matter! At the beginning of the meeting, you said the opposite! Madame, we thank you for your diligence in the service of justice. You can be free. Let's move on to a vote that will close this debate. And yes, take revenge for my unfortunate father! Gentlemen, will either of you take the floor to speak in defense of M. De Morcerfa? With a hand lift, do you admit that M. De Morserff is guilty of treachery, in betrayal and unworthy behavior? Unanimously, M. De Morcerf is expelled from the House of Peers. The first one fell. He was like a rag. I know his self-righteousness. All these upstarts, who achieved their goals with useless means... And M. De Villefort, inflated and arrogant, too becomes such. Your Excellency, the Comte de Morcerfa asks you for a meeting. Aha! He did not lose time! I did not say that your excellency is at home. I was not afraid of Mr. de Morcerfa when he was omnipotent, I will not be afraid of him even now, when he is already nothing. Gayde, my dear, do me a favor. Take it instead of me. "Instead of you?" Yes. You agree? - Have I ever challenged your desires? - Thank you. Let Mr. de Morcerfa enter. And tell him that I'm not. Are not you afraid? You have nothing to fear. Are you here?! I asked the Count of Monte Cristo. "He's not here." If young people of our time refuse to fight in a duel, have to do it to their fathers! Tell me, where does Monte Cristo hide? Sorry?! This champion of honor should know that they are not hiding behind a woman's skirt! I'm looking for him, not his mistress! Once again I ask, madam: Where does he hide? And at the same time, tell me, Why does he hate me? Look at me and you will understand. Edmond Dantes! Yes! The prison where you imprisoned me was strong. But I still came out from there. You accept my challenge to a duel, which will end only by the death of one of us? I refuse to duel with you! You are not worthy of it! You always acted like a traitor, a bad soldier! Dishonest officer, you stole your patches! The crosses that you wear are an insult to those who deserve them! Unworthy, dishonest! You are a scoundrel, with whom they do not fight in a duel! Leave! Mister Bertuccio! Conduct on the exit of M. De Morcerfa. From now on, the doors of my house are closed to him! I dare not retell Madame what is written in the newspapers. I am indifferent to any comments. But do you have the results of the meeting of the Chamber of Peers? For Mr. Morcerfa it all ended very badly. It's so bad, madam, that even the servants do not want to work for him. Feeling of honor in the kitchen?! This coachman has set all up! But, of course, I remain faithful to Madame. And I'll stay with you, no matter what happens. Thank you, Nicole. But I, just do not know if I can leave you. - Mother, I'm not distracting you? - Not at all! Leave us, please. What is this suit? Thanks to my friend Maximilian Morel, I was able to quickly join our army in Africa. I did not want to be reproached for being an extra day living with my father's money. Are not you angry that I made this decision without consulting you? What's the difference, because you were sure that I would approve it. Oh, Mother, how I love you! And how I pity you! You know, you seem so beautiful to me. This is better than a man of light, useless and idle. I really like this decision. But you, mother, whose side will you take? The same as you, dear Albert. Did not you notice that I no longer wear jewelry? Even the ring? In a month my dresses and furniture will be sold. And what will you live on? Until I do not deserve officer shoulder straps, I can not help you! The Count of Monte Cristo wrote to me, that gives me a house in which his father died. It was there that actually I had to spend my life. Having made a huge detour, I return to my main road. But you will be there alone, in complete confusion! No. Not in its place I was in these scenery. This is the land of my youth. And this is the place in France, the closest to Africa. There I will wait for your return. And you know that... What do you need, Nicole? "Oh, madam, great sorrow!" Explain yourself! "Mr. de Morcerf came home an hour ago." He locked himself in his room. Oh, madam, take courage! "He committed suicide?" Yes. Shot straight in the heart. Time, two, three, four and 5 hundred francs. Add another 6th. But you gave me your word that I agree to 750 francs, so I brought 500. You have a beautiful hat! Oh, and a cane with a gold knob! Okay, give me a cane in the supplement, and this month we are in the calculation. You are crazy? A cane costs 800 francs! Oh, you have such rich friends! I assure you, you do not realize the seriousness of the situation! If I were shameless, I could blackmail you. Then I will not come any more, get yourself out. And do you care about me out of kindness? Out of pure generosity? Out of friendship. No. You're just afraid. If you could kill me, make me disappear, you would do it right away. You're just a coward! So much so that it even disgusts me to depend on you. "Then do not ask me anything." As you say. Listen, I have an idea! If you agree, after that we are no longer acquainted, and you will never hear of me. - What's an idea? - It's simple. You give me the address of your richest friend, plan for his apartment, tell me where to find his coins, pay out everything I owe, and we are counted on for life! I agree. You see how easy it is to agree with me! And it's nothing to you. But you must give me a good address. House of Monte Cristo. It's just not in Paris. He holds a lot of cash in the secretary in his office. As easy as pie! - Servants not? - No. Only a half-deaf concierge living in the annex. "Do you have any dogs?" - No. It's in Neuilly. "Neuilly is good!" Quietly, calmly. What address? Avenue de Longsham, 53. Good. Draw me a house plan. The perfect deal for a burglar. The gallery with windows overlooks the garden. The death of M. De Morcerfa demanded some courage from him! You're mistaken, Gayde. This is a manifestation of higher cowardice. He never for a moment thought about his wife, about his son! Your Excellency, the messenger brought this letter. He says it's very urgent. From whom? This man did not say. He left so quickly that we did not catch up with him. ABOUT! Dirty paper, vulgar handwriting... Clearly an anonymous letter. You in gloves - open, please. The name of this person? Well-wisher. I did not doubt it. And what good do I want? Mister Count Monte Cristo warns that today at midnight in his mansion the robber will climb. Ruthlessly having finished this person, the Count of Monte Cristo will serve good to all their fellow citizens. Signed: Well-wisher. How many spelling errors? 3, Your Excellency. And one blot. - Should we warn the police? - No! On the contrary, we must let all the servants go home. "What if it's something serious?" "It's very serious, dear Gayde." Lock in your apartment, and turn off all the lights. It is necessary that the house seemed uninhabited. And me and Ali and Bertuccio we will wait for the robber. "The house has enough weapons." Do not touch it! My benevolder most wanted, that we mistook this robber. If this informant wants to get rid of someone so much, not for us to do all the dirty work for him. So calmly finish your dinner. The holiday will be held only at midnight. Your Excellency! The first man jumped into the garden. I see. And the other? The one that stayed on the street. Do you recognize him? "Looks like it's Benedetto?" Yes. That's what I meant. Go to Ali. But most importantly - do not cause evil to my burglar! Benedetto is right behind this. Oh, what locks! It's funny! Father Buzzoni? That's a surprise, Mr. Carlos! And I thought you were in Toulon? Because of some troubles? My father, a stranger passed me. This madman has done a good service to society. If this man was in my hands, as you are now... My father, you will not surrender me? I did nothing to find a job! In the depths of my soul, I'm an honest and hard-working guy! Edmond Dantes knew me well. Remember, I told you? Edmond Dantes did not have the best opinion of you, but... he, poor fellow, had no idea what you were capable of! But I wanted to rob the Count of Monte Cristo, because I'm dying of hunger! But certainly not from thirst. It was necessary to somehow give yourself the courage, entering the house to people who did not invite you. I'm sorry, I will not do it again, my father. Pity me, do not betray me! Your happiness, that I do not trust human justice, and I leave you to the will of the heavenly judgment. That's nice, my father. Words of a holy man! You have two choices: Or I give you the police, and you return to hard labor... Oh, my father, call it the second way out! Or I'll let you go from here, but on one condition: You leave just as you came. And I will be free? "If God will." - Then, it's OK. My father, you saved me once more. Have you made your choice? Oh yes, without hesitation! Then leave. The same way that came. Thank you, Father. Father Buzzoni wants you to let me through. "Come on in." He left? "Just as it came, Your Excellency." Here he goes through the garden, climbs over the wall... Second! How did you get hurt? The scoundrel hit me right in the chest! Who hit you? Listen, my strength is left, but I will not leave until I give it up! Benedetto, this is it! Benedetto, a runaway convict. Calls himself the Marquis of Cavalcanti. Do you understand everything? Yes, the Marquis of Cavalcanti. Now you can die. He will return to Toulon! And his legs are shaking with chains! Chains! Chains... Gentlemen, the trial is on! The meeting is open! Guard, enter the defendant. The defendant, get up! What is your name? Not that I wanted it, but I do not know my name. You were sentenced to hard labor under the name of Benedetto. This is the name that was given to me, but it is not mine. I am a foundling. Date of your birth? They say - on the night of September 27 to September 28, 1817. "Where?" In the vicinity of Paris, in Otay. Apparently, I'm from a good family. Of people "comme il faut". If they abandoned me, it means that they did not face. Answer the questions without commenting! Where did you get such information from? "From my foster father." For if I did not know my real father, As a foster father, I had somehow who. It turned out srednenko. Quiet! Once again, I forbid you to make judgments. Do not think that I am on purpose, Mr. Chairman. It goes without saying. I have a smooth speech - a gift from birth. I think my real dad was an orator, a lawyer, and maybe even a judge! Quiet! Deliver us from your impudence! What profession did you get? Well, I was a smuggler, a counterfeiter, lived on the handouts of a street wench. And, finally, he spent several years in penal servitude. But, leaving her, I did not ask the director for help. The jury will take into account the cynicism of the defendant. And this, too, I owe to my dear daddy. For if the police tried to find out who I am, a bit more insistent... It seems to me, Mr. President, that the discussion about the person of the defendant is meaningless, since he does not know anything about his origin. "Excuse me, Mr. Prosecutor General", the defense attaches great importance to the fact that the defendant is an abandoned child, and that he found in the casual people the care and tenderness in which his father refused him. The defense will draw from this only a couple of stories, to which the court is accustomed. I invite you, Mr. President, to disregard this. And I, on the contrary, demand that the origin of the defendant be clearly established. According to Benedetto's uncontrolled statements, who now, to pity the court, calls himself a foundling, yesterday, to blind the ladies, as he called himself? The Marquis of Cavalcanti! On this issue, the defense asks for a witness. Enter the first witness. Swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. Raise your right hand and say: "I swear!" "I swear it!" What is your name? Bertuccio Salvardi. - Place of Birth? - Calvi, Corsica. In the year 1790. - Your profession? - Majorord at the count of Monte Cristo. What do you know about the birth of the defendant? He was born in Otoi. On the night of September 27 to September 28, 1817. "How do you know that?" I was there. - In home? - No. In the garden. Mr. President, ask the witness, but does he have a criminal record? 6 convictions, Mr. Chairman. I told you I'm a Corsican. I stayed in prison for everything, I'm clean before the community. I refuse to hear a witness who has 6 convictions! Mr. Prosecutor should know that I'm not lying, because there was another person there. Which he knows well. He is such a respected, high-ranking person, that no court will refuse to hear it! Who is this witness? The man I told the vendetta. I repeat, I'm a Corsican. I hit him in the chest with my dagger. A former convict found protection in the murderer! The court can not listen to evidence, which there is no evidence! The evidence you want, Mr. Prosecutor, - it is a scar over the left breast of the person I hit. And this person is easy to find, because it is not far! Mr. Chairman, I ask you to suspend the meeting. Late! Father Benedetto, counterfeiter and murderer, his father is Mr. de Villefort! And to sit on the dock should not this scoundrel, but the Attorney General! Quiet! You can be free. Mr. Prosecutor General, you must answer such impudence! Mr. Prosecutor General, I conjure you to answer! Your silence becomes your accusation! Everything that this person said - true. I remain at the disposal of the Attorney General... which will come to replace me. Guard, take the defendant away. The case is postponed to the next meeting. The hearings are closed. M. De Villefort! What do you need from me again? You got a blow that will finish you off. It remains now to find out who has brought it to you. Who you are? Get to know me. The Count of Monte Cristo! No. Look closer! I do not know who you are. Think better! Remember! The evening of your betrothal... and my... Edmond Dantes! Edmond Dan... The retribution has come to pass! The third time. Madam, you have a guest. A guest? He says that he is your friend. Friend? You! I surprised you? I should have known it was you. I did not want to leave France without saying goodbye to you. You are leaving? Yes. "For how long?" - Forever. A! Forever? "Do you have news of your son?" Yes. He was wounded, received the first patches, was awarded... Will come to the treatment for me. You will write to him, give me assurances of sincere friendship. I hope, Mercedes, do you have enough? Yes, I'm very happy here. Thanks to you. So you do not want to ask me anything? Want. I would like to ask you a question. I'm listening to you. Are you leaving forever? With Gayde? Yes. Forever? Do you love her so much? I am one of those who love once in a lifetime, Mercedes. And by the way... my life has now lost all interest. I fulfilled my mission. Did I do it right? Was I right? To judge the Lord. She grew up in your homeland. In your father's garden. And she was cut off by Mercedes. I'll keep it. Very carefully. You do not regret that you left? No. But you look sad. It is impossible to leave the country without regrets. But look over there! This is the last image I take with me. What is it? END Translation and subtitles: Lisok (Lisochek)
