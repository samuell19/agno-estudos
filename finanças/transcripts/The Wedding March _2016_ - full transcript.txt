DON'T WORRY, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. THANK YOU. MM-HMM. OKAY... THAT GOES. LAMP CAN STAY. CURTAINS GO. QUOTES FROM "THE WIZARD OF OZ"? BRINGS TO MIND TORNADOS, WITCHES, AND DEPRESSED FARMLANDS. ALL OF THESE KNICKKNACKS CAN GO. AW, "WORLD'S GREATEST DAD." THAT'S SWEET. YEAH, SWEET, BUT GUILT-INDUCING. DO WE WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE THAT AN ALL-CASH BUYER MISSED HIS KID'S SCHOOL PLAY OR FIRST PITCH? IT'S WAY TOO CROWDED IN HERE. LET'S LOSE EVERYTHING, MAKE IT MORE SIMPLE. OH! PURPLE.

I JUST DON'T THINK THAT MADSEN KID IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU. YOU DON'T THINK ANYONE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. ANYWAY, WE BROKE UP. OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN I GO OFF TO COLLEGE? PROBABLY RENT AN APARTMENT NEAR YOUR CAMPUS. HONEY, I KNOW IT'S JUST BEEN THE TWO OF US FOR A WHILE NOW, BUT YOU'VE GOT THIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE TO LIVE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. BUT YOU'LL BE ALL ALONE HERE, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MOM DIED. I'LL BE FINE. I'VE GOT MY GUITAR, I'VE GOT MY DOG, AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF STRANGERS WHO LIKE TO TIE THE KNOT IN MY BACKYARD. I'LL HAVE THE PAPERWORK SENT OVER FIRST THING. MAKE YOU SURE YOU GET SOME SUSHI ON THE WAY OUT... GET BACK TO ME ON THAT CONDO, BROTHER. DID YOU FINISH ALL THE SUSHI AGAIN? SORRY, HONEY. IT'S SO GOOD. HOW MANY OFFERS? THREE. ALL ABOVE-ASK. THAT'S FANTASTIC. PLUS TWO NEW CLIENTS FROM THE OPEN HOUSE. OH, HONEY, THAT'S WONDERFUL. CHEERS. TO US. TO US. CAN YOU STAGE THE HOPE STREET COLONIAL TOMORROW? NO, TOMORROW'S THURSDAY. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING UP ALONE, AND THEN I COULD MEET YOU THERE FRIDAY NIGHT? YEAH, OR YOU COULD SHOW THE HOLLAND ESTATE FRIDAY NIGHT, AND JUST COME UP SATURDAY MORNING. THAT'S AN EVEN BETTER IDEA. PERFECT. OKAY, SO, REHEARSAL DINNER IS AT 7:00. UH-HUH... AND I'M THINKING AROUND NOON? THAT WAY, YOU CAN SHOW THE COLONIAL ON YOUR WAY IN. THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU LOVE ME? AMONG OTHER THINGS. YEAH. WHY DON'T WE GO TO THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE RIGHT NOW, AND GET THIS OVER WITH? BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER THINKS WE ARE UNROMANTIC. WE'RE NOT UNROMANTIC, ARE WE? NO, LOOK AT US. CHAMPAGNE, SUSHI. OPEN HOUSE. THERE'S THE MAN OF THE HOUR. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? GREAT NEWS, BRUCE. MULTIPLE OFFERS. I DON'T CARE, I'M NOT SELLING. OLIVIA, THE PLACE IS AMAZING. I'VE FALLEN BACK IN LOVE WITH IT AGAIN. I'M STAYING, AND I'M BUYING THE FURNITURE, TOO. REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME YOU TRIED TO FIX THAT. I'M TRYING NOT TO. WELL, I'VE COME A LONG WAY, HAVEN'T I? FROM A SPOTLIGHT ON THE STAGE TO A FLASHLIGHT UNDER THE SINK. WEDDING CAKE. TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK. THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GOOD. MM. GOOD, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW, SHOULDN'T THE BRIDE BE DECIDING THIS? I LIKE THE LEMON. I JUST HEARD FROM THE BRIDE'S DAUGHTER. DON'T TELL ME THEY CANCELED. NO, THEIR BAND DID. OH. WELL, CALL LYNN. -OUT OF TOWN. -WHAT ABOUT THE JENSONS? I ALREADY TRIED. WELL, I'M SURE SOMEONE'S AROUND. SOMEONE IS. NO. THERE'S NO TIME TO GET ANYONE ELSE. PLEASE? IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU TO PLAY AGAIN. -I PLAY ALL THE TIME. -TO THE DUCKS. THEY GET MY MUSIC. I ALREADY SAID YOU'D DO IT. -JULIE! -IT'S SETTLED THEN. THANKS, DAD. MICK! ARE YOU IN HERE? NOWHERE TO HIDE NOW, PAL. BE RIGHT OUT! GO WITH THE LEMON. HEY. HI. DID WE HAVE A GOLF GAME I FORGOT ABOUT? WELL, IF YOU COULD TAKE THE AFTERNOON OFF, WE DO. OH, I'D LOVE TO, BUT I'M SWAMPED HERE. JULIE CAN HANDLE THINGS FOR A FEW HOURS. RIGHT? YEAH, IT'S FINE, DAD. WELL, THE THING IS, I JUST FOUND OUT WE HAVE A WEDDING COMING IN THIS WEEKEND-- FINE. BUT TOMORROW NIGHT, DINNER. AND I AM NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER. TOODLES. TOODLES. SOUNDS LIKE A DATE. SHE'S VERY FRIENDLY. SHE LIKES YOU. YEAH, I'M IRRESISTIBLE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RE-ENTER THE DATING POOL SOMETIME. BE READY SOON, GRACE! HI! MOM... ARE YOU DRIVING UP WITH US? OH, NO, NO, NO, NO. JOHNNY HAS A GOLF TOURNAMENT. WE'RE DRIVING UP TOMORROW. WHO... WHO'S JOHNNY? OH, MY PLUS ONE. YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE HIM. HE'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF MY LAST PLUS ONE. OH. CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW RELIEVED I AM THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE ALONE ANYMORE. OH, MOM, I'M NOT ALONE. I HAVE GRACE, AND I HAVE WORK. THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS HAVING A HUSBAND. I SHOULD KNOW, I'VE HAD A FEW. AND WHAT IS THIS I HEAR ABOUT YOU ORDERING YOUR WEDDING DRESS ONLINE? YOU COULD HAVE BORROWED ONE FROM ME. I'M NOT SURE WEARING A WEDDING DRESS FROM A FAILED MARRIAGE IS A GOOD IDEA. JUST BECAUSE THEY ENDED DOES NOT MEAN THEY FAILED. OH, THERE SHE IS. GRAM! I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU UNTIL TOMORROW. JUST DROPPING OFF GIFTS FOR MY TWO GIRLS. OLIVIA... THANK YOU, MOM. NOW, GRACE, I KNOW THAT YOU PREFER THE NATURAL LOOK, BUT YOUR MOTHER WILL ATTEST TO THE POWER OF MAKEUP. YOU SHOULD TRY THE WRINKLE CREAM, HONEY. IT'S NOT EVERY DAY SOMEONE LIKE JOSH COMES ALONG. A DEMAIN. DID SHE JUST CRITICIZE US, OR COMPLIMENT US? I THINK BOTH. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU AND JOSH TOOK FOUR DAYS OFF? I'M PRETTY SURE... NEVER. THAT'S HORRIBLE. ACTUALLY, I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST WEEKEND WITHOUT AN OPEN HOUSE. WELL, WE ARE LEAVING THE CITY BEHIND NOW, SO YOU TWO CAN'T DO ANY BUSINESS. I LIKE YOUR THINKING, HONEY. REMEMBER THAT WHEN I TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE GUEST LIST. 48. 48? GRACE, THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO JUST BE A FEW FRIENDS. I KNOW, I GOT CARRIED AWAY. WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED? SOME OF THEM ARE COMING UP ON SATURDAY... OKAY, WAIT, SATURDAY? BUT MOST OF THEM ARE DRIVING UP ON SUNDAY FOR THE CEREMONY. AND THE DINNER, AND THE MUSIC, AND THE LANTERN LIGHTING OVER THE LAKE. ARE YOU MAD? NO. NO. OF COURSE, I'M NOT MAD. THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL. HI! WELCOME TO WILLOW LAKE. I'M JULIE TURNER. GRACE PERSHING. WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE, LIKE, 15 TIMES. 16. NICE SHOES. THIS IS MY MOM, A.K.A. THE WORST BRIDE EVER. OH... HI. I'M OLIVIA. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. WOW, YOUR PLACE IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. I MIGHT SUGGEST YOU MOVE THIS PLANTER OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PORTICO-- -MOM... -SORRY. IT'S PERFECT THE WAY IT IS. WEDDING JITTERS? WORKAHOLIC. HMM. I PROMISE THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL BE AMAZING. SHALL I SHOW YOU AROUND, OR SHOULD WE WAIT FOR THE GROOM? OH, NO, NO, IT'S JUST US. HE'LL BE HERE ON SATURDAY. HOPEFULLY. HE'S THE WORST GROOM EVER. THE PERFECT COUPLE, THEN. WHO'S THIS? THAT'S LUCKY. LUCKY? HE DOESN'T USUALLY TAKE TO STRANGERS LIKE THAT. GOLDEN RETRIEVERS AND I GO WAY BACK. WE'VE HAD THREE. US TOO. SORRY, GIRLS, I'LL GRAB THIS REAL QUICK. BRUCE, HI. COME ON, I'LL SIGN YOU IN. I LOVE THOSE. WELL, THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I'M YOUR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER. YOU TOOK THOSE? THEY'RE AMAZING. THANKS. THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL. IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN I'D HOPED. WE CAN HAVE THE CEREMONY EITHER INSIDE OR OUT. OUTSIDE. DEFINITELY. SHOULD WE WAIT FOR YOUR MOM TO WEIGH IN? SHE WON'T CARE. YOU'RE SURE? POSITIVE. SHE'D GET MARRIED IN THE CAR IF SHE COULD. THAT COULD WORK. WE DO HAVE A TRUCK. ONCE WE GET YOU SIGNED IN, I'LL SHOW YOU THE GROUNDS, AND THE PERFECT OUTDOOR SPOT, UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE THE TRUCK. WE'LL KEEP THAT AS A BACKUP PLAN. I'LL MAKE SURE IT'S WASHED. YOU REMIND ME OF SOMEONE. WHO'S THAT? ME. LET'S JUST GO WITH THE SECTIONAL. WE CAN CHANGE OUT THE PILLOWS. A POP OF PINK WOULD BE GREAT-- YES, THANK YOU. OOH! OH! YOU OKAY? I'M SO SORRY. NO, NO, MY FAULT-- MICK? LIVVY? YOU LOOK... OLDER? BEAUTIFUL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M GETTING MARRIED. YOU'RE THE PERSHING-JOHNSON WEDDING? YEAH. HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? YOU CHANGED YOUR NAME? PERSHING WAS MY FIRST HUSBAND. HOW MANY HUSBANDS HAVE YOU HAD? WHY ARE YOU STANDING HERE WITH ALL THE TOWELS? I LIVE HERE. WHAT? I OWN THE PLACE. YEAH, IT GETS WORSE. I'M YOUR WEDDING SINGER. UH, MOM? OKAY, I'M DYING. DAD? I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS. WHAT'S WRONG? -NOTHING. -EVERYTHING. IT WAS A MILLION YEARS AGO, BEFORE YOUR FATHER. BEFORE YOUR MOM. WE WERE-- ---REALLY YOUNG. ---AND STUPID. --HE GOT A RECORD DEAL, AND HE WENT OFF TOURING, --I CAME BACK, AND SHE WAS ALREADY WITH SOMEONE ELSE. HE WAS MY FIRST LOVE. SHE BROKE MY HEART. HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS? I GUESS I JUST NEVER WANTED TO THINK ABOUT HIM. --EVER AGAIN. EVER. I'LL CANCEL. WE CAN DO THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE THING LIKE YOU WANTED. YOU WANTED TO GIVE ME A MEMORABLE WEEKEND, AND IT WILL BE THAT. BESIDES, HONEY, WE HAVE 48 PEOPLE COMING THIS SUNDAY. 57. I LIED. MAYBE SHE'LL CANCEL. YOU'D BETTER HOPE NOT. WE SPENT THEIR DEPOSIT ON DORM FEES. ALL OF IT? HI. THIS IS JOSH JOHNSON. PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AT THE TONE. JOSH, HEY, IT'S ME. OKAY, SO, THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD. WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY... OR NOT. UM, JUST GIVE ME A CALL. I LOVE YOU. FOR YOU. OH. THANK YOU. WELL, THEY'RE NOT FROM ME. THEY'RE FROM A.... "JOSH JOHNSON. NUMBER TWO REAL ESTATE AGENT IN LONG ISLAND" GOOD-LOOKING GUY. A LITTLE OFF YOUR TYPE. MY TYPE HAS CHANGED. LOOK, CLEARLY, THIS IS AWKWARD, SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO CANCEL, I UNDERSTAND. I DO. BUT I CAN'T, I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT MY DAUGHTER. BESIDES, I BARELY REMEMBER THE DAY YOU LEFT ME STANDING ON THE SIDEWALK. SO THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE, HUH? THAT'S HOW IT WAS. WELL, I BEG TO DIFFER. YOU STILL ALLERGIC TO ROSES? NO, I'M NOT. MAYBE YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ME. MOM! WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE HONEYMOON CABIN! AW, LET ME PUT THESE IN YOUR ROOM. THANK YOU. PUT THEM BY THE WINDOW, SHE'S ALLERGIC. DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT? THE RIVER ROCK FIREPLACE? THE VIEW TO THE LAKE? HONEY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. MY DAD PUT A LOT OF TIME INTO THIS ONE. YOUR DAD DID THIS? YEAH, HE REBUILT THE ENTIRE PLACE. IT TOOK HIS MIND OFF THINGS WHEN MY MOM DIED. OH. I DIDN'T KNOW. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BRING THAT UP. NO, NO, NO, I'M GLAD YOU DID. I'VE KNOWN YOUR DAD FOR A LONG TIME. I FEEL AWFUL. IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS NOW. HE'S KIND OF SHUT DOWN SINCE THEN. WHICH IS WHY I WAS SO GLAD HE AGREED TO SING AT YOUR WEDDING. HE REALLY DOESN'T PLAY MUCH ANYMORE. UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO GET SOMEONE ELSE-- -NO. -YOU'RE SURE? ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, WHERE ELSE ARE WE GOING TO FIND A POP STAR IN VERMONT THAT'S AVAILABLE ON SUNDAY FROM 2:00 TO 4:00? WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LET HIM HEAR YOU SAY "POP STAR". HE HATES THAT. OKAY, YEAH, I REMEMBER. I'LL LET YOU GET SETTLED IN. GRACE, I'LL SHOW YOU YOURS. IT'S JUST ALONG THE PATH. LEAD THE WAY. THANK YOU. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? I HAVE TO THROW A WEDDING FOR HER? AND SING! WHILE SHE MARRIES THE NUMBER TWO REAL ESTATE AGENT IN LONG ISLAND? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? UNLESS YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER. FEELINGS? I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER. SHE'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON. HOW DOES SHE LOOK? THAT GOOD, HUH? POP STAR... STAGER... LUCKY, NO! SORRY. THAT'S OKAY. HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE ROWDY. RIGHT? YOU KNOW, I RESCUED HIM, AND I THINK IT TURNS OUT HE ACTUALLY RESCUED ME. YOU REMEMBER HOW WE FOUND ROWDY? YEAH. WASN'T HE EATING PIZZA BEHIND THE DORM? THE DOG LOVED HIS PIZZA. HE DID. UM... JULIE TOLD ME ABOUT HER MOM. I'M SO SORRY. OH, THAT'S NICE OF YOU, THANK YOU. YEAH, UM... IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO ADJUST. I THINK I'M STILL ADJUSTING. YEAH. WHAT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND? HUSBAND NUMBER ONE? OH, THAT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH ADJUSTING. HE LEFT AFTER GRACE WAS BORN. I'M SORRY. IT ALL WORKED OUT. WELL, YOU SURE PICKED A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO SETTLE DOWN. OH. YEAH. IT WAS MY WIFE'S HOMETOWN. FIGURED IT'D BE A GOOD PLACE TO RAISE A KID. JULIE'S A GREAT GIRL. SO IS GRACE. YEAH. I GUESS WE DID PRETTY GOOD THEN. YEAH. WELL, I'D BETTER GET BACK TO MY... STUFF. OH, SURE. SEE YA. YEAH. OH, UM... HOW'S YOUR MOTHER? STILL HATES YOU. SO, THE GROOM. WILL HE WANT TO GO OVER THE MENU? NO, HE AND MY MOM HAVE THE SAME TASTE. THEY'RE EXACTLY ALIKE. THAT MAKES IT EASY. I GUESS IT DOES. HEY, GIRLS. -HELLO. -HI. IT'S NICE THAT YOU GUYS ARE SO CLOSE. ACTUALLY WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER, TEMPORARILY. SHE'S "GROOMING" ME. MOTHER AND DAUGHTER STAGERS. YIKES. SHE WANTS ME TO BE JUST LIKE HER. YIKES AGAIN. NO KIDDING. DO YOU HAVE ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS? ONLY CHILD. ME TOO. YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB, ORGANIZING THIS WEDDING. I SURE HOPE SO. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING HERE. WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS THE PERFECT WEDDING, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT MIGHT BE... MIGHT BE WHAT? NOTHING. I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M TALKING SO MUCH. BECAUSE OUR PARENTS ARE EXES? AND WE HAVE THE SAME SHOES. HE'S SELLING THE PLACE. HE DOESN'T THINK I KNOW, BUT HE LEFT THE INFO ON THE OFFICE COMPUTER. HE'S NOT EXACTLY A TECHIE. HE SAID YOU LOOKED GREAT, BUT WOW. -DUKE! -HI! AW, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHO IS OUR BOY GONNA GET TO DO THE COOKING, HUH? YOU STILL, UH, COOKING FRIED CHEESE STICKS WITH PEANUT BUTTER? YOU KIDDING? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING FOR YOUR REHEARSAL DINNER. AND I'M GONNA BACK HIM UP ON DRUMS ON YOUR WEDDING SONG, TOO. ♪ BA-DUM-BUM... ♪ OH, YOU HAVEN'T MISSED A BEAT. OR LOST A POUND. -YOU LOOK GREAT. -THANK YOU. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT CLUB THAT WE PLAYED, THE ONE NEAR THE RIVER? IT WAS MORE OF AN INDUSTRIAL RUN-OFF. WELL, YEAH, AND WE HAD THE THREE AUDIENCE MEMBERS... YEAH, IT WAS THE BARTENDER, THE WAITER AND THE DISHWASHER. THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE SONG YOU WROTE FOR THAT ONE WAS, UH... IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. YEAH. OH. ARE YOU STILL WRITING? UH, YEAH, I MEAN, WELL, POST-ITS. AND WEDDING VOWS. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT, BY THE WAY. AW, THANK YOU. HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE? ALL MY LIFE. IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST. HE NEEDS A FRESH START, AND THERE'S TOO MANY MEMORIES HERE. IT SOUNDS LIKE GOOD MEMORIES. YEAH. HE GAVE UP A LOT TO RAISE ME. HE SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT DAD. HE REALLY IS. YOU'RE LUCKY. NOT EVERYONE HAS ONE OF THOSE. HE WON'T SAY IT, BUT HE'S DREADING THE DAY I LEAVE FOR COLLEGE. MY MOM WENT THROUGH THAT PHASE. AND SHE SURVIVED? THEY ALL DO. AND HE'LL MAKE YOUR ROOM REALLY NICE WHEN YOU COME HOME FOR HOLIDAYS, SO YOU WON'T WANT TO LEAVE. THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD. HE'LL PROBABLY BUY HIMSELF A FEW THINGS, CLOTHES, MAYBE A NEW CAR. OKAY... AND THEN THERE'S THE HOBBIES. YOU KNOW, THE THINGS THEY THOUGHT THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO DO BUT REALLY DIDN'T? LIKE WHAT? IN MY MOM'S CASE, IT WAS WEAVING. FOLLOWED BY SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING. SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING? IT'S AN OLYMPIC EVENT. OH, AND THE MANDARIN LESSONS. YOUR MOM CAN SPEAK MANDARIN? "NI HAO. NI CHIFAN LE MA." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? "HELLO, HAVE YOU EATEN?" WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT SHE ASKS ME IN ENGLISH FIVE TIMES A DAY. THANK YOU. 'KAY. TALK TO YOU SOON. JOSH, HI! SO, GUESS WHAT I JUST HEARD? DID GRACE CALL YOU? HONEY, I... I WANTED TO TELL YOU MYSELF. IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL-- ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IT'S A HUGE DEAL. PROPERTIES LIKE THAT NEVER COME ON THE MARKET. WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE LISTING WENT UP YESTERDAY. "FOR SALE BY OWNER. NO BROKER." APPARENTLY, THE OWNER IS SOME SINGER WHO WAS FAMOUS IN THE '70s? IT WAS THE '80s. IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU COULD PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR ME BEFORE I GET UP THERE? ACTUALLY, NO, I CAN'T. IT WOULD BE A LITTLE WEIRD, BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT, HE'S MY COLLEGE BOYFRIEND. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I KNOW, IT'S TOTALLY AWKWARD. AWKWARD? IT'S GREAT. UNLESS HE HATES YOU FOR BREAKING UP WITH HIM. NO. IF I GET THIS LISTING, IT COULD OPEN UP THE HIGH-END VERMONT MARKET. THIS COULD BE BIG FOR US. I... I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT. WELL, THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU. HONEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT COMING UP BEFORE SATURDAY? WHY, WHAT'S WRONG? I DON'T KNOW, I JUST MISS YOU. AW... I MISS YOU, TOO-- OH, HANG ON, I GOT ANOTHER CALL. I GOTTA TAKE THIS ONE. JULIE SAID THIS IS BEST FOOD IN TOWN. GREAT. I AM STARVING. HI THERE, HANDSOME. YOU CLEANED UP REAL GOOD. DID YOU TRY ON THE DRESS YET? MM. I WILL. I PROMISE. WEDDING VOWS? ALMOST. MOM... I STARTED. OKAY. LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE. OKAY. TELL ME YOU'RE NOT GOING TO READ FROM YOUR PHONE AT THE CEREMONY. "JOSH... "WHEN I STAGED YOUR OPEN HOUSE THREE YEARS AGO, "I HAD NO IDEA WE'D END UP HERE. "REAL ESTATE IS A SMART INVESTMENT, AND SO IS OUR RELATIONSHIP." WHAT? IS THAT BAD? AWFUL. ALL RIGHT, HOW'S THIS? "JOSH, YOU MOVE HOUSES, AND YOU MOVE ME." WHAT WAS THAT? HER WEDDING VOWS. I'M STILL WORKING ON THEM. DO YOU HAVE A TABLE IN ANOTHER PART OF THE RESTAURANT? SORRY, MICK. IT'S AN HOUR WAIT. HOW ABOUT ONE NEAR THE KITCHEN? OR MAYBE IN THE KITCHEN? IS THERE A PROBLEM? UH, NO. SO... YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER? YES, WELL, WE USED TO. CAMILLE, THIS IS LIVVY PHILLIPS. OR, UH, I'M SORRY, PERSHING... SLASH-HYPHEN- JOHNSON-TO BE? HI. HI. -I'M OLIVIA. -NICE TO MEET YOU. YEAH, NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. THIS IS MY DAUGHTER, GRACE. -HI. -HI. OLIVIA'S GETTING MARRIED ON SUNDAY. OH, CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. SHE'S MARRYING THE NUMBER TWO REAL ESTATE AGENT IN LONG ISLAND. OH. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN. THANK YOU. SO, WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT? OH, UM, I THINK YOU WERE TELLING ME HOW THIS IS YOUR FIRST ACTUAL DATE IN AGES. I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE MET. AT THE P.T.A. MEETING? RIGHT. MOM... OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY. WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT? WEDDING VOWS. RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE SONG WE WROTE IN CENTRAL PARK? I REALLY DON'T RECALL. -YOU WROTE A SONG? -SEVERAL. JUST SOME WORDS, THAT'S IT. I THINK WE USED TO CALL THEM LYRICS. HOW AM I JUST HEARING ABOUT THIS NOW? BECAUSE IT WAS A MILLION YEARS AGO, AND I BARELY REMEMBER. WHAT WAS THE SONG? WHAT WAS IT... "WHERE DREAMS COME HOME." REALLY? NOW, WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE? OH, MY. DO WE HAVE A COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT HERE? OKAY... FINE. I'LL CHANGE IT. OH, NO. NO, DON'T. IT'S CATCHY. I'M STARVING... OH... OH! OH... IT'S BAD LUCK TO SEE THE DRESS BEFORE THE WEDDING, RIGHT? YOU'RE NOT THE GROOM. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GRACE, SHE'S WITH JULIE. THEY WENT TO GET FLOWERS. OH. YOU FINISH THOSE VOWS YET? BECAUSE I HAVE A WHOLE DRAWER OF UNUSED LYRICS. OLD UNUSED LYRICS. OH, IT'S SO HARD TO TURN DOWN, BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY NO. YOUR LOSS. HEY, HOW WAS YOUR DATE? YOU SHOULD KNOW, YOU WERE PRACTICALLY ON IT WITH ME. WELL, IN THAT CASE, I'D SAY YOU'RE A BIT RUSTY. I'M NOT RUSTY! I GUESS SEEING THE DRESS BEFORE THE WEDDING IS BAD LUCK. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. IT'S MY FAULT, I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE ROOM. TAKE IT OFF, I'LL GET IT CLEANED. I WOULD IF I COULD GET OUT OF IT. I'M PRETTY SURE CLEANING IS NOT AN OPTION. IT'S JUST RIGHT HERE. DO YOU GET ALONG WITH JOSH? YEAH. JOSH IS COOL. REALLY. YOU TRYING TO CONVINCE ME OR YOU? NO, HE'S A GREAT GUY, AND MY MOM SEEMS HAPPY. MOSTLY. I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST NOT SURE I'VE EVER SEEN THEM ACTUALLY KISS. I MEAN, ON THE LIPS. THAT PASSION, LIKE IN THE MOVIES. BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE GET OLDER. WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD? HAS HE BEEN SEEING ANYONE ELSE? NO. I TRY, BUT... HE DOESN'T PLAY WELL WITH OTHERS. MY DAD'S A GREAT GUY, HE JUST NEEDS A LITTLE-- A LITTLE EXCITEMENT? EXACTLY. MY MOM'S THE OPPOSITE. SHE COULD USE A LITTLE... SMALL-TOWN-I-NESS? THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO LIFE THAN JUST WORK, RIGHT? THERE BETTER BE. OH! OH, I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GET THAT FIXED. LOOK-- I'M SORRY. IT'S FINE. IF I STAY HERE LONG ENOUGH, I MIGHT NEED A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE. WELL, THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE A BAD THING. I'M JUST SAYING, I GUESS I'M USED TO SEEING YOU IN JEANS AND STUFF. YOU'RE NOT USED TO SEEING ME AT ALL. THAT'S TRUE. HI, JANEY! MICK, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD, GOOD. WE NEED A DRESS. YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED? YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE NEVER GETTING MARRIED AGAIN. OH.... I'M GETTING MARRIED. HE'S STILL ON THE MARKET. GREAT. RIGHT THIS WAY. LOOKS A LITTLE MERMAID-Y. NO. NO. NO. THAT'S THE ONE. REALLY? DEFINITELY. OKAY. WE'LL TAKE THIS ONE. THERE'S NO "WE". THANK YOU, BUT YOU ARE NOT BUYING MY WEDDING DRESS. I RUINED THE FIRST ONE. RING THIS UP. NO, ACTUALLY, HERE. PLEASE TAKE MINE. I APPRECIATE THE OFFER, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE THINKING ABOUT YOU EVERY TIME I WEAR THIS DRESS. WELL, HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU PLANNING ON WEARING IT? ONCE. WELL, AT LEAST LET ME BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE. SO, YOU'RE A CHEF AND A DRUMMER? WELL, I USED TO BE. YOU QUIT THE MUSIC BIZ LIKE MICK? NO, NO, I USED TO BE A CHEF. I'M STILL A DRUMMER. RECENT CUTBACKS AROUND HERE DON'T REALLY ALLOW ME TO DO MY BEST WORK, THOUGH. I DIDN'T SEE THAT IN THE BROCHURE. OH, DON'T WORRY, MICK'S ORDERED ALL THE TOP-SHELF STUFF FOR THE WEDDING. YOU PLAY WITH HIM BACK IN THE DAY? YEAH. YEAH, I WAS THE HEARTBEAT OF THAT BAND. WHY DID HE LEAVE? I THINK HE THOUGHT HE WAS CHASING A DREAM, AND HE JUST DIDN'T REALIZE HE'D LEFT THE REAL THING BEHIND. WHY DIDN'T MY MOM GO WITH HIM? THEY WERE A TEAM. YOU'D HAVE TO ASK YOUR MOM THAT. THEY WERE REALLY THAT GOOD TOGETHER? THEY WERE A PERFECT HARMONY, THEY WERE LIKE ONE VOICE. IT WAS PURE MAGIC. I WISH I COULD'VE HEARD THEM. WHAT DID THEY WRITE ABOUT? I'VE GOT SOMETHING I THINK YOU MIGHT WANNA HAVE A LOOK AT. THIS IS EVERY LYRIC THAT YOUR MOM AND MICK WROTE. "I FOUND WARMTH IN YOUR EMBRACE, "COMFORT IN YOUR HEART, AND HOME IN YOUR EYES." WOW. YEAH... YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S MICK'S HANDWRITING. THIS ONE. YEAH, THAT'S YOUR MOM. "LOVING YOU IS LIKE BREATHING "I CAN'T STOP "BUT WHEN I DO "I WANT TO HAVE MY LAST BREATH SPENT SHARING A KISS WITH YOU" IT'S A LITTLE UNSETTLING, 'CAUSE IT'S MY MOM, BUT WOW. THEY WERE INTENSE. INTENSE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I JUST CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THIS. MAYBE PEOPLE GET OLDER, AND... AND CHANGE. OR SOMETIMES, THEY JUST NEED TO BE REMINDED OF THEIR BEST WORK. YOU MIND IF I TAKE THESE? THEY'RE ALL YOURS. THANKS. YOU KNOW, WE USUALLY DON'T GET DAUGHTERS PLANNING THEIR MOTHERS' WEDDINGS. OH, YEAH, GRACE JUST REALLY WANTS IT TO BE SPECIAL. DON'T YOU? YEAH, I... HONESTLY, I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE WITH A CEREMONY IN THE COURTHOUSE, BUT GRACE IS 20 AND STARRY-EYED. WELL, YOU WERE 20 AND STARRY-EYED. YEAH, IT'S WEIRD. OUR KIDS ARE THE SAME AGE WE WERE WHEN WE MET. TO BE HONEST, I'M FREAKING OUT THAT JULIE'S GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE. YEAH, WHEN GRACE MOVED OUT, I REDID HER ROOM FOUR TIMES IN ONE WEEK. AND I SLEPT IN HER CHILDHOOD BED, UNDER A POSTER OF THE BACKSTREET BOYS. OKAY, I'M NOT DOING THAT. IT'S FUNNY HOW TIME FLIES. I STARTED DRINKING HERBAL TEA AND POMEGRANATE JUICE. HMM, ANTIOXIDANTS. OMEGA 3'S, GLUTEN? OH, "GLUTEN," I HATE THAT WORD. HOW ABOUT THIS, "V.I.B.B.A." "VERMONT INN BED & BREAKFAST ASSOCIATION." I'M THE TREASURER. OH. I.P.S.A. HOME AND PROPERTY ASSOCIATION, THIRD V.P. HMM, M.S.G.U., MAPLE SYRUP GROWERS UNITED. AND YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THE P.T.A. GIRLS WILDERNESS GROUP LEADER, NEW YORK BOARD CO-OP DIRECTOR, RULES COMMITTEE, AND NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH. HEY, I CANNED MY OWN JAM LAST YEAR. OH, EXCUSE ME. JOSH! HEY, SWEETIE. HI. HOW'S IT GOING UP THERE? OH, IT'S GOOD. NOT THAT GOOD. REGULAR GOOD. DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM YET? WE TALKED. UM... LISTEN, HONEY, I'M NOT FEELING THAT COMFORTABLE BRINGING IT UP IN THIS SITUATION. IS THAT HIM? UH...YEAH. PUT HIM ON. I'LL ASK HIM. OKAY. JOSH... UH, HEY, JOSH. CONGRATULATIONS. WELL, THANKS. I HEARD YOUR PLACE IS FANTASTIC. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. WELL, IT'S HERE WAITING. SO OLIVIA TELLS ME THAT YOU TWO HAVE A HISTORY. ANCIENT HISTORY. I BELIEVE IN BEING UPFRONT ABOUT THINGS, DON'T YOU? UH... SURE. SO I'M JUST GOING TO COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT. OKAY. I CAN GET YOU WAY ABOVE ASKING PRICE. WHAT? I KNOW THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT. BUT IF YOU GIVE ME THE LISTING, I'LL GUARANTEE IT. THE LISTING... OH, RIGHT, RIGHT. UM... YOU SAID ABOVE ASKING? WAY ABOVE. WELL... SURE, WHY NOT? THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT. I GOTTA JUMP ON THIS CALL. TELL OLIVIA I LOVE HER. WHAT DID HE SAY? UH...

LIKE A DECENT GUY? IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER, I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WERE-- DON'T SAY "JEALOUS." I WAS GOING TO SAY "HAVING FEELINGS FOR HER AGAIN." DON'T SAY THAT EITHER! BUYERS LOVE CELEBRITY PROPERTIES. I THINK WE SHOULD PLAY UP THE POP STAR ANGLE. DO WE REALLY HAVE TO DO THAT? WELL, I ONCE SOLD A HOUSE FOR DOUBLE THE COMPS, JUST BECAUSE A REAL HOUSEWIFE, WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS, USED TO LIVE THERE. WOW... WHAT A ROOM. OH, THANK YOU. I RESTORED IT TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE. I'D SAY WE STAGE IT, AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO. YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY LIKE IT THE WAY IT IS. IT HAS CHARACTER. IT FEELS RIGHT. FOR A COUNTRY INN. IT IS A COUNTRY INN. NOW. NOT THAT YOUR PLACE ISN'T AMAZING, BECAUSE IT IS. BUT THE WALL STREETERS AND THE TECHIES REALLY GO FOR THOSE CLEAN MODERN LINES, AND THAT IS OUR TARGET MARKET. DON'T WORRY, OLIVIA IS THE BEST. LUCKY, COME ON, GET OUT OF HERE. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED GO ON, COME ON, COME ON. UH, SORRY, JOSH ISN'T REALLY A DOG PERSON. I WAS ATTACKED AT AN OPEN HOUSE BY A POODLE. A TOY POODLE. I THINK I HAVE IT FIGURED OUT. SHOULD I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY? THAT WHOLE SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW-- SOMETHING BORROWED-- SOMETHING BLUE. HERE'S THE OLD. WHAT'S THAT? IT'S ONE OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S VEILS. SHE KNEW MY MOM WOULDN'T WEAR IT, BUT THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD SNEAK IT IN SOMEHOW. SHE'S CRAFTY. SO AM I, AND DEVIOUS. SO, WHAT'S THE "NEW"? I BOUGHT HER AN ANKLET. I'LL GIVE IT TO HER THE DAY OF THE WEDDING. THEN YOU JUST NEED SOMETHING BORROWED. GOT IT. SHOULD I ASK? MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ. "YOU AND ME "ON AN OPEN ROAD "THE STARS ALIGN AND THEY GUIDE US ON "BUT WHEREVER WE GO WE ARE HOME." I LOVE IT, WHERE'S IT FROM? MY MOM WROTE IT. SHE'S REALLY GOOD. LIKE MY DAD. SHE WROTE IT FOR YOUR DAD. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. AND THERE'S MORE. HOW MUCH MORE? AN ENTIRE BOX FULL. DUKE SHOWED ME. DON'T TELL HIM I TOLD YOU. I HAD NO CLUE. BUT IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. YOU'VE SEEN HOW THEY'VE BEEN ACTING. I DON'T THINK IT'S AS LONG AGO AS WE THINK. AND SO YOU'RE PUTTING THIS IN HER BOUQUET BECAUSE? I'M CRAFTY. AND DEVIOUS. I KNOW YOU SEE IT. RIGHT? I DO. SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WE WAIT. AND HOPE NATURE TAKES ITS COURSE. WOW. IT IS BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE, ISN'T IT? INCREDIBLE. I WONDER WHAT THE LAKEFRONT FOOTAGE IS? JUST KIDDING. NO REAL ESTATE TALK. NO REAL ESTATE TALK. MAYBE GRACE WAS RIGHT. ABOUT WHAT? WE'RE UNROMANTIC. WE'RE NOT UNROMANTIC. I MEAN, LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE. AND WE'RE GETTING MARRIED IN, UM... WE'RE GETTING MARRIED IN 46 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES. YOU SET A REMINDER FOR OUR WEDDING? DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT. HEY... THIS IS US. YEAH. THIS IS US. I WONDER HOW FAR THIS PATH GOES? LET'S FIND OUT. OH, HANG ON. WHAT IS IT? IT'S NOTHING. I KNOW THAT LOOK. LOCAL BROKERS. AND? WITH A TON OF CLIENT ACCESS. BUT IT CAN WAIT. COME ON, I'LL RACE YOU AROUND THE LAKE. HEY... GO AHEAD, GO MEET 'EM. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YEAH. I MEAN, THE LAKE'S GOING TO BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK, AND SO WILL I. WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME? THEN WE CAN GRAB A BITE IN TOWN AFTER. YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK I'D RATHER JUST STAY HERE. ARE YOU SURE? YEAH. LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I'LL BE GONE, LIKE, AN HOUR. TWO, TOPS. NO BIKING AND TEXTING. I KNEW IT. YOU OWE ME FIVE BUCKS. SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN AFTER YOU SELL THIS PLACE? YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN YOUR RESTAURANT. AND WHAT, YOU'LL BE MY MAITRE D'? MAYBE. SO, YOU HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT THIS THOUGH A LOT, HAVE YOU? JUST PLAYING IT BY EAR. LIKE IN THE OLD DAYS. WHEN YOU USED TO TAKE CHANCES. I'M JUST SAYING, YOU USED TO GO AFTER THE THINGS YOU WANTED. OH! OH. I THINK I LIKE THIS ONE. HEY, MOM, YOU'RE ON SPEAKER PHONE. HI, HONEY, UM... I'M ON THE LAKE PATH, AND MY CHAIN SLIPPED OFF. I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO FIX IT, SO I'M GOING TO BE JUST A LITTLE LATE GETTING BACK. I'LL SEND SOMEONE. NO, NO, NO, DON'T BE SILLY, I CAN WALK. WE GOT THIS. HOW FAR DO YOU THINK SHE GOT? FAR ENOUGH. DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW? HEY. OH, HEY. SORRY. NO, IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WELL, THANK YOU. WELL, YOU CAN JUST CONSIDER THIS PART OF THE CONCIERGE SERVICE. THANKS. OH, YEAH. CHAINS ARE TRICKY. YEAH. OF ALL THE PLACES FOR YOU TO PEDAL INTO, YOU HAD TO PEDAL INTO MINE, HUH? YEAH. WELL, WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE THAT THIRD-FLOOR DORM. -YEAH. -YEAH. THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. AS LONG AS YOU'RE OUT HERE, THERE'S A PLACE A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG THAT'S PRETTY SPECIAL, IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT. SURE. WHY NOT? FOLLOW ME. WOW. TOLD YOU IT WAS SPECIAL. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. YEAH. I THINK THIS IS OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE PLACE. MINE TOO. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE I'M SAYING GOODBYE, AND YOU'RE SAYING "I DO." NOW, THAT COULD BE A SONG. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO LET GO OF ALL THIS? I'M NOT SURE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS, LIVVY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE INN, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW, ARE WE? I'M NOT FALLING FOR THIS AGAIN. FALLING FOR WHAT? FOR YOU. WELL, I REMEMBER YOU WERE PRETTY HAPPY WITH ME ONCE. I REMEMBER THE TAIL-LIGHTS OF YOUR VAN AS YOU DROVE AWAY. OH, COME ON, I HAD A TOUR. YOU PROMISED YOU'D COME BACK FOR ME. I DID. OH, SORRY FOR NOT WAITING TWO DECADES. TWO DECADES? IT WAS SIX MONTHS AT THE MOST. AND YOU WERE ALREADY WITH SOMEONE ELSE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU DIDN'T COME BACK FOR ME. YEAH, I DID. I WENT TO YOUR DORM. YOUR ROOMMATE SAID THAT YOU'D MET SOMEONE. MY ROOMMATE? MY-- WHY WOULD YOU BELIEVE HER? WELL, WHY WOULDN'T I? BECAUSE SHE HAD A CRUSH ON YOU, AND SHE WAS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR, AND IF YOU HADN'T GIVEN UP SO EASY, YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS. I... NOTHING. I'M GOING BACK. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS WEDDING TO BE OVER. WHAT DOES IT NEED? NOTHING. IT'S PERFECT. WELL, THANK YOU, BUT THAT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL. EVERYTHING YOU'RE PREPARING IS AMAZING. IT CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER. TRY THE SAUCE THAT GOES WITH THIS. AND? ARE YOU GOING TO BE MAD IF I SAY "AMAZING?" -YEAH. -THEN NO COMMENT. YOU ARE LIKE YOUR MOM, VERY SWEET. TRY IT AGAIN. IT'S BETTER, RIGHT? I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? DON'T EVER SETTLE. LIFE'S TOO SHORT, GRACE. WE'RE STILL TALKING FOOD, YEAH? YOU DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD MARRY JOSH EITHER, DO YOU? WHAT I THINK... IS THAT IT CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER. MM. MM-HMM. HEY... OH, HI. I'M SORRY, I KNOW THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A WEEKEND WITHOUT AN OPEN HOUSE. OH, HONEY, WHAT'S A WEEKEND WITHOUT AN OPEN HOUSE? AFTER THE WEDDING, WE'LL TAKE SOME TIME OFF. YOU MEAN A HONEYMOON? NOT THAT MUCH TIME. YES, A HONEYMOON. NO CELL PHONES, OR SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS? DONE. I HAVE TO HEAD INTO TOWN AND PICK UP THE SIGNS. YOU GOT THIS? OH, I GOT THIS. SEE YOU SOON. OKAY. -MORNING, GRACE. -GOOD MORNING, JOSH. REHEARSAL DINNER TONIGHT. GOT IT. DON'T GO TOO FAR! WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT! WORST GROOM EVER. SO, WHERE'S HE OFF TO? OH, IT'S OKAY. OPEN HOUSE. HE'LL BE BACK. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, AREA RUG, YES OR NO? I LIKE THE RUG. YEAH, I DO, TOO. I MEAN, IT DOESN'T SAY "WALL STREET," BUT... IT STAYS. GUILT-INDUCING? LET'S LEAVE THIS THE WAY IT IS. YOU KNOW, UM... MAYBE A LITTLE SENTIMENTALITY IS GOOD. BUYERS CAN SEE THAT PEOPLE WERE HAPPY HERE. I HAVE TO SAY, I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE. I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. EXACTLY. GOOD MORNING, MICK. MORNING, LADIES. MORNING. YOU DON'T... NEED ANYTHING FROM ME, RIGHT? NO. NOT A THING. YOU READY? YEAH. OKAY, UH... WHERE WERE WE? AS I RECALL, WE WERE LEAVING EVERYTHING EXACTLY AS IT WAS. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. MOM... ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED? WHAT? IT'S JUST... YOU'RE DIFFERENT AROUND HIM. HIM? WELL, IF I AM, IT'S JUST BECAUSE HE BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN ME. OR THE BEST. HONEY, I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH AN AWKWARD SITUATION. IT WOULDN'T BE AWKWARD IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE FEELINGS. NOW, THAT-- THAT IS RIDICULOUS. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY WEDDING PLANNER. I'M ALSO YOUR DAUGHTER. AH! WE SHOULD JOIN THE WEEKEND TOURNAMENT AT THE CLUB. YEAH, MAYBE... YOU SEEM DISTRACTED. I'M HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE MOVING ON, I GUESS. FROM THE INN, OR HER? THE INN. WELL, SHE'S GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW, RIGHT? YEAH. OKAY, WELL THEN, PROBLEM SOLVED. YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO SEE HER AGAIN. OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SELL THE INN, WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING SPECIAL. LIKE A WEEKEND AWAY SOMEWHERE? A WEEKEND? OR A WEEK. I MEAN, WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU JUST WENT TRAVELING AROUND? A LONG TIME AGO, AND IT WAS ON A TOUR BUS. WELL, I'M THINKING MORE... HOTEL, AIRPLANE, SANDY BEACH. THIS COULD BE A SWEET CORPORATE RETREAT. IF WE GUT IT, YEAH. EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING. WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE OUTSIDE. 800 FEET OF PRIMETIME LAKEFRONT. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO AN OPEN HOUSE. I'VE BEEN TO TOO MANY. LOOKS LIKE A BIG TURNOUT. AT LEAST HALF OF THEM ARE HERE JUST TO SEE THE PLACE, AND MAYBE GRAB SOME FREE FOOD. IT'S THE OTHER HALF I'M WORRIED ABOUT. IT'S WEIRD THINKING ABOUT THIS PLACE BELONGING TO SOMEONE ELSE. OR A CORPORATION. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE IT WON'T SELL, ALTHOUGH WITH A PROPERTY LIKE THIS... HOW GOOD A SALESMAN IS JOSH? HE SOLD MY MOM ON MARRIAGE, SO I'D SAY GOOD. I'D BETTER START GETTING USED TO THE IDEA. THE THING IS, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVE, AND IT'S HARD. BUT YOUR DAD WILL BE OKAY. AND YOU WILL, TOO. YOU HAVE EACH OTHER. THANKS, GRACE. COME ON, LET'S GRAB SOME SUSHI. REHEARSAL DINNER? "OPEN HOUSE SUSHI." YOU SEE ALL THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE? TRYING NOT TO. YEAH, ME TOO. I REMEMBER WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PLACE. THERE WAS NO SUSHI, JUST AN OLD HOUSE AND A RUSTY DOCK. AND AN EVEN RUSTIER DRUMMER WHO MADE GRILLED CHEESE ON AN IRON. WHY'D YOU TAKE THAT OFF THE MENU? I THOUGHT IT WAS A HOUSE FAVORITE? MORE LIKE A DUCK FAVORITE. SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? ABOUT WHAT? SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OUT ON THE BIKE TRAIL. NAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S MY FAULT. I DON'T KNOW WHY I GOT SO UPSET. PEOPLE GET NERVOUS AROUND WEDDINGS. YEAH. I SEE IT ALL THE TIME. DID YOU REALLY COME BACK FOR ME? YEAH, I DID. THERE HE IS... POP STAR IN THE FLESH. WHOA-HO, HUGE FAN! CAN I GET A SELFIE? SURE. MY MOTHER PLAYED YOU NON-STOP WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. YOUR MOM, HUH? AND MY GRANDMOTHER. OH, YES... I'VE ALWAYS BEEN BIG WITH THE GRANDMOTHERS. I CANNOT WAIT TO TELL THEM WHOSE PROPERTY WE'RE BUYING. I THINK I JUST HEARD AN OFFER. COME ON, LET'S SHOW THEM WHERE WE'RE GONNA TIE THE KNOT. RIGHT UP HERE, GUYS. SWEETIE? WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE READING THERE? I WANTED TO DO A TOAST AT THE WEDDING, AND I NEEDED SOME INSPIRATION. BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO WRITE ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THEY REALLY LOVED EACH OTHER, DIDN'T THEY, GRANDMA? OH, IT WAS SO LONG AGO, THEY WERE WET BEHIND THE EARS, PUPPY LOVE. IT WAS MORE THAN THAT. MAYBE. DEFINITELY. EVEN BEFORE MICK LEFT, YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM. WHY? AS A MOTHER, UM, YOU WANT THE BEST FOR YOUR KIDS. SO, IF YOU SEE HEARTACHE COMING, YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO JUMP IN AND DEFLECT IT. READING THESE, I'M GUESSING SHE GOT HIT ANYWAY. WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST IS PASSED, AND IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT. I MEAN, SHE'S GOT JOSH NOW. BUT WHAT IF HE'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE? AND WHAT IF HE IS? TELL YOU WHAT... WHY DON'T YOU LET ME MAKE THE TOAST, HMM? IF YOU THINK OF SOMETHING, YOU CAN ADD ON. IT'S JUST ONE LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT. FOLKS... I'VE GOT A CHOIR GROUP IN AN HOUR. WHERE'S OUR GROOM? HE'S... HE'S ON A CALL. HE WON'T BE LONG. PERHAPS WE COULD USE A STAND-IN UNTIL HE GETS HERE? OH, YES, JOHNNY WILL DO IT. GO ON. I KINDA MADE A VOW NEVER TO WALK DOWN ANOTHER AISLE, SO... AND I'M JUST HEARING ABOUT THIS NOW? MICK, YOU DO IT. UNFORTUNATELY I'M A LITTLE BUSY. DAD, GET UP THERE. THE REVEREND HAS TO LEAVE. COME ON. AND... MUSIC. WE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER TO UNITE A COUPLE IN LOVE. OBVIOUSLY, THE BRIDE AND GROOM WILL BE STANDING A LITTLE CLOSER. CLOSER. CLOSER. THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD. I BELIEVE YOU'VE WRITTEN YOUR OWN VOWS. UH, ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T QUITE FINISHED MINE. YOU REALLY HAVEN'T FINISHED? NO. SORRY, IT'S JUST, YOU USED TO WRITE ENTIRE SONGS FASTER. WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE WORDS WERE MEANINGLESS. OH, OUCH. DOES THE STAND-IN HAVE TO TALK? PERHAPS WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE OFF TRACK. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SONG? YEAH, THAT'S ME AGAIN. WE'LL SKIP OVER THAT. RINGS? THE GROOM HAS THE RINGS. AND THEN, OF COURSE, DOES ANYONE OBJECT TO THIS UNION... JUST STRETCHING, THAT'S ALL. SIT DOWN. MOVING ALONG, I'LL PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE, AND YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WELL, YOU DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WITH A MAN OF GOD, DO YOU? SORRY, EVERYONE! YOU MUST BE THE GROOM. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY, REVEREND, BUT I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS. TWO OFFERS. BOTH OVER ASK. ALL CASH, 30-DAY ESCROW. 30 DAYS? WELL, I COULD PUSH FOR 15 DAYS IF YOU WANT. NO, I WAS THINKING OF PUSHING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. IF YOU LET THEM SLEEP ON IT, THEY MIGHT NOT SLEEP IN IT. AND WITH THE PROFIT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE, I'M GOING TO FIND YOU THE PLACE OF YOUR DREAMS. BUT THIS WAS THE PLACE OF MY DREAMS. THERE ARE ALWAYS BIGGER DREAMS. CONGRATULATIONS. WELL, I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS IS IN ORDER FOR BOTH OF US. OKAY, YOU TWO. MAYBE A BRIDE AND GROOM KISS? OH, YES. SURE. GOOD IDEA. GREAT. OH, HANG ON, MY PHONE. SORRY, I FORGOT TO SHUT OFF MY PHONE. YEAH, I'LL TURN IT OFF. GOOD, ALL RIGHT. OKAY. WOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL A REHEARSAL DINNER. LET'S EAT! OH, HEY, MICK. I'LL HAVE THOSE PAPERS DRAWN UP AFTER THE WEDDING. YOU KNOW, I THINK OUR BEING HERE WAS FATE. MAYBE. IT'S LOOKING LIKE OURS WILL BE THE LAST WEDDING HERE. TO MARRIAGES AND MORTGAGES. AND YOU'RE GONNA BE PAYING FOR BOTH OF THEM FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST. OLIVIA... I KNOW I'VE BEEN CRITICAL OF YOU. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER, SWEETHEART. MOM, WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS? I'M APOLOGIZING. I'VE BEEN MARRIED A FEW TIMES, AS A LOT OF YOU KNOW, BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WAIT FOR THE RIGHT ONE. YOU ARE A WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL, SMART WOMAN, OLIVIA, AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. AND IN THE END, YOU ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING. HEAR, HEAR. TO OLIVIA. TO OLIVIA. THANK YOU, MOM. I KNOW YOU GUYS WANTED TO DO THIS AT THE COURTHOUSE, BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER IN THIS AMAZING PLACE, EVEN IF YOU DID MANAGE TO SQUEEZE IN AN OPEN HOUSE. MOM, YOU ALWAYS TOLD ME TO FOLLOW MY HEART. TO FOLLOWING YOURS. THANK YOU, HONEY. I KNOW I'M NOT PART OF THE FAMILY, BUT I FEEL LIKE I AM TONIGHT. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF WEDDINGS HERE, BUT THIS ONE IS SPECIAL FOR A LOT OF REASONS. I WISH YOU BOTH THE VERY BEST. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. DAD, YOU SHOULD MAKE A TOAST. ME? NO! DAD... MICK, PLEASE. IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ALL OF US. UM... WELL, AS PART OF OLIVIA'S PAST, IT'S... IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET HER FUTURE. JOSH, YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN. WHEN I THINK OF THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER... ...I FEEL SICK. BECAUSE YOU NEVER THINK, AT 19, YOU'RE GOING TO MEET THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE. I SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT FOR YOU THEN, LIVVY, BUT I MESSED UP, AND I CAN'T STAND TO WATCH YOU SLIP AWAY AGAIN. WE BELONG TOGETHER. DON'T MARRY HIM! THAT'S ENOUGH. I'M SORRY. BUT I LOVE HER. I ALWAYS HAVE-- JOSH! IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY. HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE HIT ME HARDER. I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU, MICK. I'M SO SORRY. HERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART. THANKS. I JUST CAME TO SAY GOODBYE. HOW'S YOUR DAD? HE'LL BOUNCE BACK. ALWAYS DOES. I'M SURE THE DUCKS WILL HELP HIM THROUGH IT. HOW'S YOUR MOM? SHE'LL SURVIVE. WE'RE JUST HEADING OUT, I'M GUESSING A WEDDING WOULD BE A HARD SELL AT THIS POINT. I'D IT'S ON HOLD AT LEAST. MOST LIKELY A VENUE CHANGE IF ANYTHING. UNDERSTANDABLE. I WISH THINGS ENDED DIFFERENTLY. ME TOO. GROUP HUG. YOU HAVE MY EMAIL AND MY NUMBER. FRIEND ME. I'M SO SORRY, MOM. I JUST WANTED THINGS TO BE ROMANTIC FOR YOU. I KNOW, HONEY. IT'S OKAY. IT WAS AWFUL. YOU KNOW, HONEY... IT WASN'T. I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT THE PAST FEW DAYS, AND, YOU KNOW, I'VE REALIZED THAT I'VE BEEN STAGING MY LIFE, AND NOT LIVING IT. AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO STAGE YOURS, TOO. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE THE NEW ME. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANT TO BE THAT PERSON. GO FIND YOURSELF, SWEETHEART. WHO KNOWS, MAYBE YOU'LL EVEN WANT TO BE A WEDDING PLANNER. AFTER THIS WEEKEND? I DOUBT IT. COME HERE. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. WELL... IT'S STILL OFFICIALLY MY WEDDING DAY, AND... I HAVE NOTHING TO DO. DINNER AND A SAPPY MOVIE? I WOULD LOVE TO. IT'S JOSH. HEY. LEMON CAKE? WHY NOT? YOU OKAY? I'M HANGING IN THERE. I'M PROUD OF YOU, DAD. I RUINED A WEDDING, AND I LOST THE GIRL. YOU TOOK A RISK. AND FAILED EPICALLY. NOT IN MY EYES. YOU KNOW, MY COLLEGE ISN'T THAT FAR AWAY. YOU CAN VISIT ME ANYTIME. AND YOU CAN VISIT HOME ANYTIME. THANKSGIVING AT YOUR NEW PLACE? THANKSGIVING HERE. I'M NOT SELLING. REALLY? WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND A PLACE ANY BETTER THAN THIS? I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE THE WORLD'S GREATEST DAD. AND I'VE GOT A TROPHY TO PROVE IT. ARE YOU OKAY? I'VE BEEN BETTER. I'M REALLY SORRY. I GUESS IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE ANYTIME SOON. PROBABLY NOT. UNLESS YOU HAVE A LISTING NEAR THE COURTHOUSE? IS THERE ONE? WE ARE GOOD TOGETHER, OLIVIA. WE ARE. AT WORK. I THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH. SO DID I. BUT IT'S NOT, FOR EITHER OF US. HEY, YOU TWO. SO... I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER? NO, THAT... RECENTLY FELL OUT OF ESCROW. OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. IT'S ALL GOOD. WELL, THE REASON I CALLED YOU BOTH IS THAT I'VE DECIDED TO LIST AFTER ALL. REALLY? I MEAN, THE PLACE IS AMAZING, AND OLIVIA, IT'S NEVER LOOKED BETTER, BUT... IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ME ANYMORE. I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. BRUCE, I HAVE A GREAT LISTING THAT JUST CAME ON THE MARKET. KILLER VIEWS, 3,200 SQUARE FEET. WHEN YOU SEE IT, YOU'RE GONNA FORGET THAT YOU LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE. AND HE'S BACK. ...IT'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC. HEY! DRINK UP. WE GOT A GIG. DON'T TELL ME YOU BOOKED ANOTHER WEDDING? NO, A CLUB. TWO NIGHTS. AND BEFORE YOU SAY NO, THINK OF ALL THE PERKS.
