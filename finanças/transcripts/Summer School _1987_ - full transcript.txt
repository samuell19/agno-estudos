You'll notice your grade cards are blank. Now, who better to evaluate a student's progress than the student himself? ALL: Yeah! Good morning, young people. Vice Principal Gills has some words for you. Mr. Gills. Thank you, Principal Kelban. (HISSING) Well, well. I suppose that you all remember the English skills test you took last month? STUDENTS: No. I had English? Was that the dot-to-dot puzzle? Yeah, that was it, yeah. No, I don't remember. I'm not surprised. All of you failed. However, in accordance with the district's new policies on minimum academic proficiencies, you will all have the opportunity to retake the exam. Great. - Oh, joy, I have a boner now. (WONDERMUTT BARKING) (BOYS WHISTLING) Hi. Hi. I'm all packed. Are you ready? One minute to go. Your parents have all been notified that you'll be retested after completing the mandatory course in Remedial English. In summer school. What? What? We just finished a whole semester of school and we gotta go to summer school? You're crazy. I ain't going to summer school. My grandmother's gonna kill me. ALL: 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! (BELL RINGING) I won! I won! (GASPING) I won! I won! Gills, Kelban, I did it. I did it. Look at this puppy. 50,000 big ones. You know what this means? No summer school. Wait a minute, you gave me your word. That was the old word. My new one is "money." A man of your integrity would let a mere 50 grand weaken his commitment to education? I have seen lesser men win millions in the lottery go right back to busing tables! They're frigging morons! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Don't look at me. You're in charge of summer school. May I speak with you a minute? Sure, what can I do for you? I need you to teach summer school. Dearadorian just quit. Didn't he teach Remedial English? Well, yes... Winnick! Musway! Stop! Stop! Mary! I have to talk to you. Kim, get in the car. It's okay. I'll meet you at the airport. I'll get a cab. Take Wondermutt with you. (WONDERMUTT BARKING) Shoop. All right. Mr. Shoop. Oh, Mr. Shoop. Congratulations. You've been chosen to teach summer school. Oh, shoot. If only I'd known sooner. We're going to Hawaii. May I remind you, Mr. Shoop, you're up for tenure. You want a job next year? Come on, Mr. Gills. Look, we got leis on and everything. You'll be teaching Remedial English. Remedial English? Look, I ain't no English teacher. See? Double negative. No, I hand out basketballs, check for jockstraps. I'm, like, very challenged. I'm not a real teacher. That's all right. These aren't real students. They're unmotivated, irresponsible. Not too bright. They'll relate to you. I appreciate that. No. No, look, the only reason I got into this whole teaching gig in the first place was to get my summers off. No, I'm afraid my answer has to be no. No, thank you? Bottom line, Mr. Shoop, you need my recommendation for tenure. This is blackmail. We call it school spirit. Kim. Have you ever seen The Wizard of Oz? Oh, I love that movie. Yeah. Yeah, me, too. And my favorite part is when Dorothy, she clicks her heels together three times and she says, "There's no place like home. "There is no place like home." Oh, Shoop, I understand. You do? You're not disappointed? No. I'll just go by myself. What, alone? I'll make friends. Look, Kim, if you love me, I mean, even if you just like me a lot, you won't do this. Shoop, if I didn't like you, I wouldn't ask you to drive me to the airport, now would I, hmm? Guess not. You're in room 43. Files on your students. A word to the wise, Mr. Shoop. Right off the bat, you show 'em who's in charge. Hmm? Great. Who is in charge? Very cute. Thanks. So are you. Oh, you meant... Jeez, I'm so embarrassed. But you are cute. I'm all right. I'm Robin Bishop. I teach American History next door. Hi, Freddy Shoop. Remedial English, right here. Everybody just calls me Shoop. Okay, Shoop. Why am I here? Oh, thumbtacks. Could I borrow some? Sure. I was just gonna get my summer bulletin board goin' here. Jackpot. Whole box. Here you go, my treat. But what about your bulletin board? Oh, yeah. Give me one. Remedial English, huh? I got it easy, I have honor students. They're here voluntarily. Can you believe it? No. I've seen some of your students. Very scary. You must be a good teacher. Shucks, Robin, I don't know. Heck, inside every so called "bad kid" is a good kid just waiting for someone to reach on down through the sleaze and the slime, pick him up and hose him off. I mean, who knows, if we fail with even one child, we might be losin' the next Ted Koppel. We're the unsung heroes. We're doin' God's work. And I notice you're not wearing a wedding ring. Yeah, my mother noticed that, too. So you're single. In love? Involved? What's the story here? The story is that I've been seeing someone. But we just started dating, so you do what you think is right. Okay. I better get going. Well, here, I'll walk you. So you're free to see other people then, huh? Are you asking me out? Well, if I was, would you say yes? I might. Well, I might be asking you out. Do you like Chinese? I hate it. Me, too. I can't stand it. Wanna go out some time and not eat Chinese? I might. Why don't we talk about that after school? I'm in love again. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The crowd goes mild. Hey, wow. Kevin? What happened to football, buddy? Yeah, man. I was kicked off the team for being stupid. All right, it's about time. Congratulations, bud. Sorry I'm late. Hey, Mr. Shoop. Wow. You're in this class, too? Mmm-mmm. I'm teachin' it. No way! ♪ Party all the time! Party all the time! ♪ My girl likes to party all the time! ♪ All right. All right, have a seat. Let's see who the lucky winners are. Larry Kazimias. Where's Larry? Shh. He's nocturnal. Oh, okay. Try and keep it down. Francis Gremp? Don't ever call me that. The name is Chainsaw. As in Black & Decker? As in Texas Massacre. Oh, yeah, that's in here. It's in there. They got files on us. Pam House. Says here you lack concentration. Pam? Hmm? (STUDENTS SNICKERING) Never mind. Jerome Watkins. Computer said I failed that test. The computer made an error. I recommend this time, I pass. You're gonna do well, Jerome. I can feel it. Alan Eakian. Present, sir. Four brothers, two sisters, all straight-A students. What are you doing here? I assume there was some sort of a baby mix-up at the hospital. Rhonda Altobello. - Here. You went from C's to F's. What happened? Any other questions? No. Denise Green. What's that file say about me? Whatever it says, it's a lie. You wanna know something about me, ask me. I'm right here. What you want to know? Where are my car keys? - How would I know? What, does that thing say I'm a thief, too? All right, where are my car keys? Chainsaw? They're somewhere in this room. Right now you're very cold. You're really cold. I want those keys. Oh, God, you're freezing. Okay. Okay, I'm a fun guy. I'll play along. Getting warmer. DAVE: You are getting hot, man. Oh, I see smoke. - You are on fire! Oh, you're walking on the sun! Ouch! Oh, wait! Wait! My mistake, I forgot where I put them. You're ice-cold, dude. (BOYS LAUGHING) Come on, enough of this shit. Ooh! Now does that mean we can swear in class? Shit, yes! Hey, watch your fucking language! DAVE: Watch your language, fartface! (ALL CLAMORING) Where are my frigging car keys? There's the dick-brain that knows. If I knew anything, would I be in this butthole class? Suck my loggerhead. Damn it! Jizzumhead! Jizzumhead. Yeah, good one. One of my all-time faves. Psychology. You give a child the license to swear, they lose all interest in it. I certainly did. I think you're full of bull. It's okay, you can say "bullshit" in here. I'm grateful. Mr. Shoop, I'm sure you're aware that I'm teaching next door. And this swearing-bee is getting a little loud. Do you think you could concentrate on some obscene gestures for a while? Yes! Yes, that's the idea. (BOYS WHOOPING) Thank you. I don't think she likes you. I want my car keys. I'm using the lavatory. Hey! This is worse than a gas station. Yeah, I think I have to go, too, Mr. Shoop. Wait a minute. Hey, wait a... My keys. Attaboy, Mr. Shoop. Hey. Hey! Okay, I'm calling roll and then I'm gonna... Where's my roll sheet? It's somewhere in this room. Hey. Sorry about the noise. I'm really a gym teacher. I don't belong in a classroom. Apology accepted. See you later. Let's start all over. Hi, I'm Freddy Shoop. Look, Freddy, you're a semi-charming guy and a real snappy dresser. You're just not the kind of guy I date anymore. Yeah? What kind of guy are you dating now? Oh, the kind who wears socks. I got a pair somewhere. White ones. So about dinner, you like Italian? Mexican? Hey, maybe you'd rather cook. I'm not having dinner with you. Okay, lunch. Robin. Excuse me just one second. Uh, Robin, about tonight, the concert starts about 8:00. So I thought we'd go to the beach and have a picnic. Watch the sunset. Sounds wonderful. Oh, bye-bye, Freddy. I'll be darned. You're a heterosexual. And a damned good one. Good luck, honey. Thanks, Mom. Okay, start her up. Uh... Make a right, please. DAVE: These photos suck. Weddings, graduations. Hoffman came in. Yeah. Ooh! It's more of the redhead with the tattoo. This time he's got her making breakfast stark raving naked. Oh, Hoffman, you're so sick. Check out this composition. Round English muffin, square butter, triangular bush. The man is an artist. Reprints. Reprints. Hi, I'd like to sign up for Lamaze classes. Okay, how are Tuesday nights for you and your coach? Perfect, but I don't have a coach. Well, what about the father? Well, you see, that's sort of confusing. It's either David Lee Roth, who's on tour, or Sean Penn. And I'd really hate to upset Madonna. Fill this out. Okay. How far did we get yesterday? KEVIN: Uh, you took roll. Right. That shouldn't take as long today. (WAVES CRASHING) SHOOP: Pam. Mr. Shoop, I gotta book. What? You just got here. Uh, yeah. It's a female thing. Oh, yeah, I understand. Oh, man, she's going surfing! I'm sure. Fuck. This menstruation deal, it's such a scam. Girls are so lucky. What? Oh, we're so lucky? You think being on your period is some picnic in the park? Are you crazy? One, you get all PMSed-out, there's no room in your purse for no hairbrush 'cause you got these damn minipads. You are so ignorant! (CLEARING THROAT) What can I say? This whole class is jammed with ignorance. Yes, it is. Come in here, please. Mr. Shoop, this is our new foreign exchange student, Anna-Maria Mazarelli. Anna-Maria is from Milan, Italy. She would like to, uh, brush up on her English skills before the fall semester begins. Well, I guess I'll let you return to your rigorous pursuit of academic excellence. Please. Anna-Maria, welcome to America. You can sit wherever you want. BOYS: You looking for a seat? Well, now, this desk appears to be unoccupied. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Okay, let's see what we got here. "Rules of grammar. "Writing paragraphs." God, I hate this stuff. "Book reports." Anybody wanna get out of here? Go to the library? Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. I am Chainsaw. Hi, Chainsaw. Hi, I'm Dave. Ciao. DAVE: Well, we love Italy. CHAINSAW: Yeah. The pizza. Mussolini. And Tony Bennett. The Mafia. Yeah. Chef Boyardee. Pinocchio. Fellatio. Oh, I don't like that. Well, have you ever tried it? Sure. Chef Boyardee, spaghetti in a can. It's so mushy. Anna-Maria? Si. Have you seen the movie, uh, Texas Chainsaw Massacre? No. It is good? Oh, I gotta tell you, I love this film. It had passion and a plucky spirit. And the characters had integrity. Like when Leatherface went on a strict diet of human flesh. He had to cut out chicken and fish completely. Dave, I agree with you. I'll go a step further. Sure, Leatherface, he wore a mask made out of human skin, and he hung people on meat hooks, but, hey, we've all got quirks. I've got 'em. You've got 'em, Dave. That's what makes this character so, so compelling. Thumbs up from me. - Same here. To sum it up, I'm Chainsaw. - I'm Dave. We'll see you... - [BOTH] At the movies. Okay. Let's go, people. I found 'em at Winchell's. Here, we all chipped in. Hey, jelly. I'm touched. This one was in the parking lot with a surfboard. This is so humiliating. Pam. You know, I grew up surfin' those same waves. Today was phenom. Three to four, breakin' out of the south, glassy, light offshore breeze. You had to go for the ditch. Thanks. You're very spiritual. But the rest of you clowns... Hey, I gotta say somethin'. This whole thing is a joke. There's a very valid reason for summer vacation. The human brain needs rest. Yeah. I mean, what are we doing here? Really. I don't wanna be here. Hey, look, this wasn't my idea. I know you guys aren't exactly fired up about English and I wouldn't know what to do if you were. But we're stuck here. We're trapped like rats. Anybody got any ideas? Mmm. Why don't we take some field trips? Can we do that? Sure, yeah. I, uh... I got permission slips right here. Okay, take these home, have your mom or dad sign 'em. As soon as I get them back, I'll see what I can do. BOY: Done. GIRL: Same here. Good.

Is going on throw-up rides and rubbing barnyard animals your idea of quality education? Grandma. Certainly not. We'll talk to Mr. Shoop about this right now. I may have used poor judgment. You actually used judgment. My God, do you realize that if anything had happened to these kids, the lawsuits? You could've bankrupted the entire district! And messed up your chances of being elected to the state assembly? Yes! Don't wet your pants. Watch this. All you had to do was baby-sit some social deviants. Some of those deviants are great kids. I'm sure they'll grow up to be wonderful criminals. They're as smart as you and me. You and I. All of us. You're suspended until Kelban returns and officially fires you. What? Hey, this is your fault. You knew I couldn't teach. Goodbye, Mr. Shoop. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Gills, what if I become a model teacher? This is gonna be fun. Okay. You get every kid left in your class to pass that skills test and I'll forget about your field trips. Done. They all have to pass? It's called teaching. Of course, if you don't know how to do that, then I guess you don't deserve tenure, do you? I'll teach. Morning, class. (STUDENTS WHISTLING) CHAINSAW: Nice tie! BOY: Mr. Shoop! BOY 1: Oh, baby. Mr. Shoop, what's with the threads, man? You getting married? No, must be laundry day. Nothing else was clean, right? Are you going to a funeral? - Could we come? Please take your seats. Where should we take 'em? Where should we take 'em? Sit down, Francis. From this moment forth, you people eat English, sleep English. You are English. Oh, then pass the crumpets, old boy.

But think about what you're asking. You want us to study? The thought did cross my mind. Well, what's in it for us? What do we get out of it? Literacy. I'm sorry, that's... I'd like to help. What can I do? Give me your car. And your house. And your dog. See you. ALAN: Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Shoop, wait! There's room here to negotiate. What if you granted each one of us one wish? What do you mean, "wish"? You know, like a favor. Does anybody need anything? I need somebody to work out with, in case I get back on the team. I could use a Lamaze coach. I need some driving lessons. Bad. Okay, there's two of us. Therefore, we get two. All right. One, a party, your house, Fourth of July weekend. In Anna-Maria's honor. Number two, you arrange a screening, in class, of the greatest movie ever made. The 1973 Tobe Hooper classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. That is also in Anna-Maria's honor. Thank you. Now, then, is there anything that you desire? Oh, I don't deserve a wish. I don't take the test anyway. God, she is so honest. We'll take hers. Chauffeur service for Dave and I, every day, to and from work. Pam, what's your wish? I'll tell Mr. Shoop when the time is right. (GIGGLING) Larry? Larry, what do you want? Bed. He wants a bed.

Oh, that's not theirs. No? Whose is it? It's mine. See, I... I live in that house right there and they were just watching my stuff. That's right. It's... It's his. We should never have taken those little baby sips. That was wrong. God, so very, very wrong. I think they learned one hell of a lesson, Officer. Next time you boys encounter an alcoholic beverage I hope you remember you're underage. Yes, sir, we will. Yeah, of course, thank... Thank you. Well, we're off to do our homework. - Yeah. All right. Thank you, Officer. Bye. - Thank you. Oh, we should never have tried this. It was a mistake. That was bad. We should've just said no. You guys are good men. Thank you. Thank you. You're under arrest for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. What? Officer, that's not really my vodka. Is that your dog? Yeah. No dogs on the beach, $50 fine. Let's go. He's not really my dog. He just thinks he's my dog. No, really, he's a neighborhood dog. He just hangs out at my place 'cause there's more garbage there than any place else. He's a scavenger. He'll eat anything. He's a beach dog, really. Go away, beach dog. Uh, do you have a cell for beginners? Boogie boy. Come on, bunk in here. Moondoggie. MAN: Yeah. (MEN LAUGHING) Who wants gum? (RINGING) ROBIN ON RECORDING: Please leave your message after the beep. Robin, it's your pal, Shoop. I can't leave my number 'cause I'm downtown in jail. Jail? What, you're surprised? I got arrested in my swim trunks, so I need 50 bucks and a pair of shoes. It's a long story. Listen, Robin, uh, please don't mention this to that bite-in-the-ass Gills. You're an angel. Dinner, dancing, Paris, you name it... Hello, Mr. Shoop. Who is this? It's the bite-in-the-ass. When I say "bite-in-the-ass," I mean that in the nicest possible way. Can I talk to Robin, please? I'm afraid Robin and I are on our way out of town. But don't worry, we'll be right over. He's still a human being, Phillip. Robin, we have a very long drive ahead of us. If we go downtown now, we'll be stuck in all that traffic. And that's okay with me, because then we'll be helping our good friend, Mr. Shoop, and you won't think I'm a shit. Right? Am I in really big trouble? A teacher arrested for contributing to the delinquency of minors? You're not a hero. What is this? I made a new friend. Mr. Shoop, I do hope that we can get you out of this ugly, little mess. And it is ugly. You know, Mr. Shoop's been making a lot of progress in his class, Phillip. It's true. I've been handin' out assignments and the kids turn them in and everything. It's almost like school in there. I've heard. And I'm proud. Confirms all my instincts about him. He's my boy. Robin, let's get out of here. We're on our way to Wine Country. You kids, uh, have fun. See those waves, Wondermutt? They're from Hawaii. Kim's in Hawaii. Robin's in the Wine Country. You know what we need? I mean, besides bread. We need a woman who will appreciate what we have to offer. A woman of culture, intellect. Shake those buns, baby! (WOMEN CHEERING) (WOMEN SCREAMING) Come on, bring those buns over here. Mama's got some software for you, baby. Excuse me. I'm with Playgirl magazine. Survey me later, will you? I'm trying to concentrate. Come on, baby. Thanks for your time. (WOMEN APPLAUDING) Shoot them buns over here. (EXCLAIMING) (EXCLAIMING) Hey! Hey! Hey, cowboy! Don't I know you? Hey, back off, hair bag. This is ladies' night. (WOMEN APPLAUDING) I love him, I love him, I love him. Larry! Mr. Shoop. What are you doing here? What am I doin' here? You do this every night? Well, we have Mondays off. Listen, man, you can't tell anybody, okay? They think I'm 21. You were fabulous. This is from both of us. I'm in the wrong business. Yeah, but about school, Larry. I mean, I think if you could sneak in a couple hours' sleep, you'd catch up with the rest of the class. Mr. Shoop, man, think about what you're sayin'. I mean, if you could be 17 again, only you knew then what you know now. Yeah. Well, I know. I hate that kid. "Who we admire most in the world and why. "The person we admire most in the world is makeup artist "and creature creator Rick Baker." "His wonderfully gruesome slime bladders and slobber tubes "in American Werewolf in London won him a richly deserved Oscar. "That is why we admire makeup artist and creature creator Rick Baker "very, very, very, very, very, very..." "Very, very, very, very, very..." "Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very... "Very, very, very, very, very much." It's 100 words on the nose. You can count if you want. "It is not easy to pick the person I admire most. "I admire people for different reasons. "The way they surf "or teach English from the heart or help the homeless. "To pick one person is so unfair to everyone else. "Isn't there enough pain in the world?" "Since there's no one I admire most, this is about a person I admire least, "my ex-boyfriend, Andre. "If he ever tells you he broke up with me first, he's a lyin' dog. "'Cause I definitely told him to get out of my face first. "You know how I could tell when he's lying? His lips move." I'm serious. He's so in love with himself, he ought to be datin' a mirror. The way he walks around in them skin-tight leather pants thinkin' he's Rick James' little brother or somethin'. Give the world a break. Denise, can I have your paper? Uh, no. No? - Well, I had to memorize my essay due to the fact that I was mugged by a gang lookin' for money and homework. That happens. Okay, gang, mark your calendars. Field trip next Monday. Where are we going, cockfights? Courthouse. Your teacher was arrested for giving vodka to some kids. You and Dave won't want to miss it. You went to jail for us? On roller skates. Thanks, man. Mmm-hmm. Pam? Hi. What are you doin' here? Remember I said I'd tell you my wish when the time was right? It's right. Your wish is to move in with me? I'm a great cook. Uh-huh. I won't get in your way. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You know we connect. Pam, look, my place is very small. It's perfect. Look, Tommy, that's my brother, he had another kid. And Angela, she's his wife, she wants to move the twins back into Gail's room and then put Sally in the den, which means I lose the couch. Yeah, well, my couch is real barbecued. The floor is fine. Mr. Shoop, everybody else got their wish. Okay, Pam. If I let you stay here, it's only temporary until you find another place, okay? I can stay. Who are you talking to? This is Tommy and Angela and Gail and Sally and Sly and the twins, Chuck and Bob, and Tommy, Jr. Uh, this is Mr. Shoop. How you doin'? Pleased to meet you. (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) (SCREAMING) DAVE: She screams so well. Oh, don't be a wuss. Shut up! Run, run. Larry! Larry, wake up, you're missing this. SHOOP: Larry's not missin' a thing. Let him sleep. GIRL: There he is. Leatherface. Leatherface. Leatherface. (HORN BLARING) BOY: Oh, no! (AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) CHAINSAW: That's not a real person. It's a stuntman. Okay, now, this. This right here isn't gonna bother him because he's insane, okay? (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) Good Lord. BOY 1: What are you watching? CHAINSAW: Do the dance for me, baby. A new film from the district, Safe Use of Power Tools. Special delivery. I don't want to know what this is, do I? No, probably not. GIRL: Come on. What a finish, ladies and gentlemen. GIRL 1: That was great. What did you think of that, Anna-Maria? God, it was really American. American, yes. It's an American masterpiece. (STUTTERING) It's... Talk about gutsy endings. The girl, the girl gets away and our hero, Leatherface, he chainsaws his own legs. Two thumbs up. Make that four for gore. Listen up, I wanna read you somethin'. "Dear Mr. Francis Gremp, thank you for informing us "of your problem with our Cool Dude sunglasses." It worked. "Please accept this assortment of Cool Dudes with our compliments." All right, it's Christmas time. Free glasses. Are these free? CHAINSAW: Yes. SHOOP: "We know you'll find them well-constructed "and we hope your organization will see no need to proceed with the boycott. "Sincerely, Wayne Appleton, President, Cool Dude, Inc." All right, the power of the pen. Hey, thanks, Chainsaw. Hey, Eakian. Eakian. Man, you think you can help me with my letter? You know, make it sound official? Sure, Denise. You wanna give it to me? (BELL RINGING) Okay, tonight, for homework, write a review of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Uh, Rhonda? Uh, if you're not doing anything tomorrow night, I thought maybe we could do somethin'. Oh, I have a Lamaze class tomorrow night. Do you wanna go with me? What about Mr. Shoop? Oh, he won't care. I mean, if you don't mind bein' my coach. I wouldn't mind at all. Great. Great. See you, Eak. Mr. Shoop. You should see this, but you can't let Denise know I showed you. Okay? Okay. Shoop, this girl's dyslexic. What are you talkin' about? That's not in her file. This is serious. You gotta get her some help. How could she get this far without anybody findin' out? She slipped through the system. What happens when she gets out in the real world? Wait a minute! Is this the same guy that took his English class to the petting zoo? How'd you get those kids to work? Bribed 'em. What would it take to get you to have dinner with me tonight? That would be very expensive. I'm having dinner with Gills. Big Phil again, huh? Come on, Robin, be honest. Isn't he a bite-in-the-ass? No, he's not a bite-in-the-ass. He happens to be very (SLURPING) articulate, cultured, extraordinarily tidy. Tall, dark and tidy. That's a magic combination. You're not in love with him, are you? None of your business. Sure, it is. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. You tell me you love him, I'll stop askin' you out. How am I gonna tell you I love him when it's all so new? I knew it. See, Robin, he is not the guy for you. You need an intelligent, sensitive man who can skate. Do you know such a guy? Oh, they're hard to find. But now that I know what you're lookin' for, I'll keep my eye out. Would you? Lookin' good, Denise. Good luck. Sir, you are really gonna earn your money today. Francis Gremp? Call me Chainsaw. You're up next. Can you hold on a sec? Dad's late. He's so irresponsible. I said, "Dad, 3:00 sharp." But, no, it's just in one ear, out the other. I need your car. You want to use my car? I'm under adult supervision. Chainsaw, you take your test and you bring my car right back here to me. You make me proud to be an American. Dave, kiss this man. You, come with me. No, no, you stay there. I'll bring the car to you. Can you back this up? I'm taking a test. All right? Just move all the way back. What? What'd I do? - Don't worry about me. See those cars on the right? Go ahead and park in between them. What do you mean? You mean parallel park? Something wrong? No, nothin'. Yeah. (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) We going on the freeway? I think we'll just stay in the neighborhood. (MUSIC STOPS) Mr. Gremp, why are you driving with only one hand? Oh, this hand's gotta be free to put around the babes. What, are you markin' me off just 'cause I'm doin' that? Watch the dip! That dip? (HORN BLARING) Hey, you crazy? Don't you ever, ever yell at the driver! Do you hear me? Where are you going? Back. The test is over. No way! That was your fault. This is bullshit. Come on. I stayed sober for this. You can't do this. Come back, you dumb dildo. Wait, no, you're not a dildo. I was joking. That was a joke. Come on, be cool. One more chance? Wait. You lost points for driving too slow and not accepting the right of way. Failed again. 70 is passing. 72. I passed? You passed. I passed! Oh, I passed! I passed! Shoop, I passed! I passed! I passed! Oh, God, I passed! Thanks! I'm proud of you. Congratulations, Denise. Oh, man, I couldn't have done it without you, really. Now, come on. You drove the car. Look, I owe you one, all right? Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Tell you somethin' you can do for me. What? - Get some help with your reading. Man. - Listen, Denise. What you have is a learning disorder called dyslexia. You need to re-train your brain to deal with information in a new way. There's a specialist who'll help you after school. Look, I'm doin' all right. Yeah, you are. But you could be doin' so much better. But that's up to you. Hey. Think about it, okay? CHAINSAW: Okay, free film. Free developing. Come on, what more could you want? Here. Look, my dad's a butcher. You like veal cutlets from Minnesota? Milk-fed. (BUZZING) Hi, honey. How was your day? Hectic. Boy, something smells good. Mmm. The manicotti. Perfect timing. Why don't you start on the cheese and crackers? (KNOCK AT DOOR) Yeah. It's open. ROBIN: Hi. Hey. I just brought this Ray Bradbury book. Maybe I should come back later. Why? Hi, Miss Bishop. Hi. Oh, um, Robin, Pam House, one of my students. Pam, Robin Bishop. Hi. Hi, Pam. Freddy, I really didn't make enough for three. If you're planning on inviting company for dinner, I wish you'd call and let me know. - No, he wasn't. Actually, I just I stopped by to help him with this lesson. But we can do that in the morning. Oh, morning's much better. I'll make French toast for the three of us. Do you like French toast? I'll bet she makes great French toast. I actually meant morning at school. Oh, fine. It was nice to meet you, Pam. You, too. Robin? I know this is none of my business, but what the hell is goin' on in there? There's nothin' going on in there. Remember those bribes? Well, Pam needed a place to stay. How long has she been here? A couple of days. Look, my laundry's never smelled so good. Here, take a whiff. I'm sure it's April Fresh. I just hope having a maid is worth the damage you could do to that young girl. See you tomorrow. All ready. Great. Uh, French or Italian? Uh, French. I knew it. Pam, we gotta talk. Sure. What's up? I think you are a great girl. And I think you're a great guy. God, this is hard. Freddy, go ahead. You can tell me anything. Okay. You know how, when you're on your board, and you see the perfect wave rollin' in and you think you got it? Only, somethin' happens and you don't... don't get it. I mean, the key to the whole thing is timing. If you're even a little out of sync, you're grim. You've blown the barrel, you're seaweed. But then you look outside and you see an even more perfect wave than the first perfect wave and that's the one you catch. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Surfing metaphors. You're the perfect wave and I'm seaweed and if you want me out of your house, just say it. No, no, I'm not the perfect wave. And it's not just that I want you out of my house. No, you want me out of your life. Pam, look, I'm your teacher. No. Look, any time one person lets himself care deeply about another person, that person runs the risk of being rejected and destroyed. I'll go get my things. No, wait a minute. Look, you cooked dinner. It looks beautiful. Let's sit down, eat. It's just food. (DOOR CLOSING) Okay. I'm gonna collect your book reports. Then we are on our way to court. Homework, Pam? You expect me to relate to the written word after the hell you put me through? Talk about shallow. I've stepped in deeper puddles. You're excused. Mr. Shoop, don't you want mine? Larry, you're awake, with homework. What's wrong with you? I got fired. They found out my real age. Hey, I didn't say a word. No, it's all right. My mom came to a show. Your mother? - It was a nightmare. I mean, before she knew who I was, she put 5 bucks in my G-string. And then my Aunt Edna, she kisses me. With tongue. And rips off my mask. And Mom freaked out. She made me put on her coat. I'm sorry. - You're sorry? I'm at my sexual peak. Once a guy hits 18, it's all downhill. But it's a lovely ride. Mr. Shoop, why did you tell the arresting officers that the vodka found in the possession of Mr. Gremp and Mr. Frazier belonged to you? Your Honor, I was trying to keep a couple of my students out of trouble. David and Francis have enough problems as it is. It's true, Your Honor. Our lives are a mess. Guys, don't help. Where did you young men obtain the vodka in question? From Murray. Who's Murray? You know Murray. Everybody knows Murray. From Murray's Liquor. Didn't this Murray ask to see proof of age? Well, I come off pretty mature. Did you show him proof of age or not? Yeah, I guess I did. May I see it, please? Uh, I'd rather you didn't. I'd rather I did. You were a black Marine in 1968? (PEOPLE LAUGHING) Vietnam. A war puts a man through many, many changes. Young man, the possession of false identification and of alcohol by a minor are serious crimes. You've just confessed to both of them. I didn't mean to. However, since the arresting officers let you off with a warning, I'll probably do the same. Is this guy bitchin' or what? Now, Mr. Shoop... Your Honor? My name is Robin Elizabeth Bishop and I'm also on the faculty with the defendant. I submit that this man went to jail for his students. Very few teachers ever exhibit that degree of dedication. Therefore, Your Honor, I move that... Don't move, Miss Bishop. You're out of order. And you're also correct. Mr. Shoop, these charges will be dropped. Case dismissed. DAVE: All right! All right! That's so... Shoop! Let me tell you something. The judge may have bought that dedicated teacher crap, but the fact remains that you covered up, thereby condoning student drinking. I am filing a report for Kelban with the entire story. Face it. Those kid's test scores aren't gonna save you, because they're losers, just like you! Hi. I was just congratulating our good friend, Mr. Shoop. Now, about lunch, sweetheart. Tell you what, sweetheart, why don't you go ahead, order two lunches and eat them yourself. One for each face. SHOOP: Tsk, tsk, tsk. Okay. Today we take a practice test. Pinpoint each of your weak spots. Then we work a couple hours after school to really straighten 'em out. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. Practice tests, extra class time? That wasn't in the contract. Eakian, get him. Hey, the test is in two weeks. You all need the extra work. I'm afraid we're gonna need some extra incentive. Yeah, like a party with a band. I could use some wheels, bad. And get me a job, man, doin' strip-o-grams. I don't believe this greed. Believe it, man. I need a houseboy. It's a simple matter of renegotiating our contracts. Renegotiate? Who do you think you are, Teamsters? Yeah, Teamsters! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Look, for the past four weeks, I have given up all of my free time. Had my body used for a tackling dummy, my house trashed, my couch set on fire, my goldfish murdered, my butt thrown in jail and my car wrecked. All I'm askin' for is a little extra effort. You know, what's sad is you guys could've all passed that test. But you're just so happy being failures that you just don't know... Why am I doin' this? Tell you what. You guys drop out and be illiterate. I'm goin' to Hawaii and be tan. Have a cow. Damn. Hey. Thanks for the help. Good luck. Where are you goin'? - To quit. You can't quit. Sure, I can. I never got through to anybody. Oh, that's not true. Those kids were learning. You're not a quitter. Yes, I am. How can you say that? I turned you down for dinner at least a dozen times in the last four weeks and you haven't quit bugging me. Wanna go out to dinner tonight? Can't. See? (ALL MUTTERING) Everybody take a seat. You, in the cot, out of bed. Where's Mr. Shoop? Mr. Shoop has tendered his resignation. Now, sit down. Would someone tell me what Mr. Shoop had planned for today? Yes? Group sex. No, that's tomorrow. Today is independent study, right after our midmorning nap. Don't think you can pull this BS with me. I want to see everybody take their textbooks out and turn to Chapter, uh, 7. Read it again. (HUMMING) Who's making that noise? What noise? I don't hear any noise. What, you got dog ears? Chainsaw, stop doing that. Stop doing what? You know, I hear it, too, and it's very annoying. I wish you'd find the hooligan that's responsible, because I am trying to read Chapter 7. Again. (ALL HUMMING) Mr. Gills, I just cannot study. I'm going to the library. Chainsaw, sit down. You people can hum till your lips fall off, I could care less. (BELL RINGING) Wait a minute. You're not dismissed. Now, I promise you, you people act like psychopaths tomorrow, and you will be sorry. Ooh. We will be sorry? Mr. Gills sure does know his child psychology. So, Miss Cura, I just wanted to let you know that the children are a little hyperactive, but I'm sure that you'll enjoy their joie de vivre. Well, so far, I've only subbed at grammar schools, so this should be a nice change. (GIRL SCREAMING) Help, Mr. Gills! Denise! Denise! Take it easy! What happened? Don't go in there without a gun. It's terrible. Is this my classroom? Yes, it is. Whose blood is that? Is that your blood? No! (SCREAMING) My God! We're back! (CHAINSAWS WHIRRING) What is wrong with you people? It's like you said, Gills! We're psychopaths! Somebody better call the school nurse! (BOTH GRUNTING) I am not amused! Turn off those motors! Everybody get up. Now! I'm not ready for high school. Why'd she leave? Didn't she like us? Where's her sense of humor? I have seen some sick things before. But this... This is... Devilishly clever. Vomitous! Thank you. We take a lot of pride in our work. Look, we want Shoop back. Why would Shoop wanna come back? So Kelban can fire him? He might surprise you. We did today. And we've got more for tomorrow. (STUDENTS CHUCKLING) Do we have a deal? (ALL I WANT FROM YOU PLAYING ON RADIO) Wondermutt, I do not want to play. Not now. I'm busy. (BARKING) (WHIMPERING) ("JACKIE" BY ELSA FIORILLO PLAYS ON RADIO) Hi. Tough day at school? We've been torturing Gills. Yeah. He said you could have your job back. Now, why would I want my job back? Hey, my life is sailin'. I got a radio, blanket, beach chair, dark glasses, dog. Why would I wanna go back to you guys? How about we can't pass that test without you? Me and Chainsaw, we've been sober for two days, four hours and 15 minutes. No kiddin'? Swear to God. Reality is so unreal. But it is a nice change. True. Thumbs up. I think you should know that you were a phase. I've outgrown you. But I do wanna be friends, if you can handle it. And, Shoop, I'm seeing that reading specialist this afternoon, too. Look, we'll study in school, after school, whatever it takes. But we need a teacher. What do you say, Mr. Shoop? Please? How can I say no to these cute little faces? Your practice test scores were great. Hey, come on, you've been here 12 hours. I want you to go home, forget about this test, get a good night's sleep. I'll see you tomorrow, 8:00 a.m., the lecture hall. Hey, trust me. Come on, you're gonna kick ass and take names. Believe it. Are we really that ready? Ready? What time's the test tomorrow? 8:00 a.m. You see, the correct answers do not stop. Now, go on. Get out of here, all of you, before the college recruiters show up and try to drag you all off to Harvard. Hey, I mean it. (DOOR CLOSES) Wondermutt, look. I found Bob. (LAUGHING) Go get it. (ALARM BUZZING) (SINGING) Yeah. Morning, Mom. Morning, sweetheart. Morning, Dad. How do you want your eggs, honey? Fried, scrambled? I don't know. What are eggs? - I'll surprise you. How do you spell "cat"? I don't know! Honey, what's wrong? I don't know what's wrong. Everything's blank. I don't know anything! I don't know anything! I don't know anything! Chainsaw! Chainsaw! Chainsaw! Are you all right? I... I had a nightmare. About what? I don't know. Great day for a test, huh? Yeah. Hey, Shoop. An apple. For the teacher. Give 'em hell. Hey! Hey, we're testing in here. I know, I'm in your class. I remember you. Where you been? Bathroom. Six weeks? My zipper got stuck. "Do not open the test booklets until you are told to do so.

He just said the average grade was below passing. So we failed. Hey, you didn't fail. I failed. Field trips to the beach, a bed in your classroom, drinking at the beach, a screening of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1. Quite a summer, Mr. Shoop. I tried to keep it interesting. I have his dismissal ready for your signature, sir. Before I sign anything, I understand there are some people waiting to speak on Mr. Shoop's behalf. Really? Come in. Mr. Kelban, you're not actually going to listen to these delinquents? No. I'm going to listen to their parents. I'm Principal Kelban. Is there a spokesperson here? I guess I am. I-I'm Howard Gremp. You're Chainsaw's father. Interesting boy. No, you can say it. He's a lunatic. Dad. You know, six weeks ago, I thought he had the IQ of a salad bar. His only interest in life was to make people sick. I mean, if my mother came to dinner, he would give the dog a third eye or an extra leg. Because of him, we stopped having kids. I mean, you can imagine the feelin' when I saw him studying. The wife and I almost burst into tears. David was doing his homework, too. It makes sense, they share the same brain. Not only did Mr. Shoop get my daughter to read, he taught her to drive. He showed Kevin there's more to life than just football. I'm not sure I agree, but it's possible. This man should not be teaching. Proof is right here in these test results. Look for yourself, Mr. Shoop. Passing is 70. Average score here was 63. They failed. That is not true, Mr. Gills. You mean we passed? Well, no. No, not all of you. But that's not what's important here. Larry went from an 18 to a 51! (EXCLAIMING) If I'd only seen you strip a week sooner. You! Mom, my hair. Rhonda. From a 29 to a 43 and she gave birth.

No previous test score because you ditched every test, but a 38. Honey, that's terrific. We'll get 'em next time. Kevin. Yeah? From a 48 to a 75! Yeah! I'm back on the team! Yeah! Kill! Yeah! Kill! (HUFFING) Chainsaw. Last score was a 6. This time, 59. Monster comeback. All right. And Dave. From a 26 to a 70. I passed! You made it! You passed? You passed and I failed, you asshole! How could you do that to me? It was an accident. I'll take it again. I can fail, I know it. And Pam went from a 53 to an 82. (ALL EXCLAIMING) Was that the highest? Well, almost. I mean, that guy who spent six weeks in the bathroom got a 91. But look, there's more goin' on here than test scores and grades. You all worked hard and you improved. Yeah, that's very nice, Mr. Shoop. The point is we are here to discuss Mr. Shoop's flagrant violation of school policies. Hold it, Gills. According to my numbers, the average scores here increased from 28 to 63. Now, that's 125% improvement. Now, that's teaching. WOMAN: Absolutely. Yeah. Mr. Shoop, I'm granting you tenure. (ALL APPLAUDING) He's back, ladies and gentlemen! This is the last time I ask. I promise. Will you have dinner with me? I'll think about it. Can I use some of that lip stuff? Does this mean we can have dinner tonight? I didn't say that. We'll just talk about it over breakfast.
