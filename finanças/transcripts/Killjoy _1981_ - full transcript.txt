[music playing] [laughing] JOY MORGAN: Stop it. Come on. Stop it. Come on, the shower's ready. Let me go. [door slam] JOY MORGAN: The robe now. Don't make a mess. Don't take too long, now. Come on, I'm ready for bed. Oh, did I forget to lock the front door again? I'm sorry you had to find out this way, but then, I suppose, sooner or later-- Oh, help. Oh, oh, oh. DR. PAUL TRENTON: Pay attention, please. With this first incision, I'm going to show you the traditional way to expose the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Now, there are still a lot of people who prefer, and use, the I-type incision, but I'm going to demonstrate the method described by Rockatansky. Uh, excuse me. Should we raise the sheet, please? Now, in Rockatansky, we begin at the right shoulder. This to the xiphoid. Same from the opposite side. Notice the soft, short strokes. And now, it's straight down the center of the abdomen to the pubic bone. This, as you will notice, creates the form of a y. Any possibility of nicking the bowel-- What's the matter, Laury? How much longer is your brilliant son going to be? We have a date. You drag me out here just to ask me that? Really, Laury, sometimes you surprise me. I'm sorry, Dr. Trenton. I mean, sometimes, I do things without thinking. Then I want to kick myself later. Don't be upset with me, OK? I'm really upset with myself. I promised your father I'd keep an eye on you, and I've, just, been so busy lately. How is he, have you heard from him? Well, the obligatory postcard from Naples when his ship stopped overnight. He's feeling much stronger, really. Good. He was pushing himself much too hard. Come on, Paul. Laury, if you want to get involved with doctors, you're going to have to learn patience. Patience. That's what you call the sick folk around here that you treat, right? Not one of my better ones, sorry. DR. PAUL TRENTON: Well, I'd rather discontinue that. Doctor Trenton. Dr. Paul Trenton, you have an emergency in the Post-Op Bar, now. Let me give you all a good piece of advice. Never ignore an emergency call when it comes from the daughter of the chairman of the board. I'm going to leave Dr. Jacobs here to see if you've learned anything from our lecture. Better pull another cadaver for them, Joe. Doctor Trenton, you've got to sign the body off. Your new rule, remember? Oh, of course. The one who makes the rules should remember them, right? Uh, let's pull number four today. Yup. I'll be with you in two minutes. I'll just wash up. OK. I'll go roust Max. [machines beeping] All right. That's it. Close up for me, please. You are stupid, clumsy, and the most inept nurse I ever had to work with. But doctor, you-- Don't try to make excuses! Your incompetence nearly killed that patient. I could promise you that when administration reads my report, you're going to be looking for another job. [kicking cabinets] LAURY MEDFORD: Temper, temper. Have you forgotten we have a date? Oh, it's been a long day. Sure, go on. I'll catch up. OK, babe. [horn honking] White wine, and a virgin Mary for the doctor. Thank you, Rosie. Hey, doc, if I ever have to go under the knife, you're the tip-topper I want holding it. Rosie, this guy's a pathologist. He only cuts up people who lie very, very still. But in your case, Rosie-- Oh, no, no favors, guys. Let's have a toast. To the adventures of surgery. I'll drink to that. Laury, I've always wondered why you decided against a career in medicine. I mean, it always fascinated you so much. I know it did. But just the work, and the study, and all the memorizing you guys have to go through. It's just drudgery. And you know me, no staying power. But who knows? Maybe some day I might get it all together and go back to Med school. What are you looking at me like that for? It's been done before. Well, in the meantime, you could keep current by marrying a doctor. Oh, of course, I've mentioned that before haven't I. Hi, Rosie. Paul, um-- DR. MAX HELLER: Could you fix me up with a double, please, down there? I got a lot of catching up to do. LAURY MEDFORD: Hi-ya, Max. Hopefully, you are in a better mood? Wow. Sorry, love, complications. What was the problem? I had a nurse who must have been trained in a fast food restaurant. One day they'll learn that you don't use amateurs in open heart surgery. Still, patient survived, thanks to my exquisite skill with sharp instruments. Thanks, Rosie. To your health. Why don't you use a piece of your exquisite fee to get your jacket fixed? Or better still, how about buying a new one? Huh, you rich kids. You really stick together, don't you? You ever hear of a needle and thread? Like, how about elbow patches? So herringbone's going to swim upstream for a few more seasons. Listen, have you told him? I was just about to, when you came in. Tell me what? Max and I are engaged. Well, when did all this happen? BOTH: Last night. Well, man, congratulations to both of you. Thanks, Paul. So you did nothing? You didn't stop her? Oh, Mother. Laury is free to marry anybody she likes. I don't own her. Well, aren't you a generous fellow? You obviously forget all those years you and Laury were growing up together. It was understood by everyone that you would get married. Mother, please. You may clear, Susanne. Yes, ma'am. Paul, Paul, don't let Heller take her away from you. He's not even a good doctor. That doesn't seem to make much difference, does it? He's a noble figure, worked on the docks putting himself through Med school. Nobody ever knew how he found the time to study. Or to play. He manages to find time to chase every skirt that appears. And he's marrying Laury only to help his career. How do you know? Max loves Laury. Max loves Max. He's using her. Oh, Paul. Laury's father is Chairman of the Board of Hospital Governors. He's going to make his son-in-law a Chief of Medical Staff. You know that. And where does that leave you? Right where I am. I'm Chief of pathology. That's all I ever wanted. Mother, don't get involved, not again. Dear, god. You remind me so much of your father, that non-entity. When he died, no one noticed he was gone. I noticed. Look, Mother, Laury has made her choice. There's nothing more to talk about. I see. So, Heller has just stolen your girl, but you don't want to talk about that. I can't take this. I have work to do. Heller is also in the process of stealing your future. I suppose you don't want to talk about that either? All right, don't talk, Paul. Do something. And get Laury back. Or I can never have respect for you again. Unlike the respect you have for me now, eh, Mother? [music playing] FEMALE (ON TV: ) What you can do with all those women you don't know-- The secret soap opera addict comes out of the closet. [laughter] Actually, it's Rosie. You know she hasn't missed an episode of 2 and 1/2 years? I'm just sitting here helping her through the agony while I have my lunch. You know how it is. Well, no, I really don't. Rosie, you think you could tear yourself away from the anguish long enough just to pour me a glass of wine? You ought not to make fun of Doctor Carter's predicament. That nurse, Tally Denton, she's pregnant. And she's going to tell his wife if he doesn't give her an abortion. Oh, well that sounds like fun. Fun, she says. As long as it doesn't happen to you, it's fun. WOMAN (ON TV): That's why you need me. I'm really glad you answered my calls. I was afraid you were mad at me. I would never be mad at you, you know that. Paul, you're the dearest friend I've ever had. I mean, I mean that. I'll settle for that. Oh, somebody left this under the door this morning. It's for Dr. Heller. I picked it up when I came to work. WOMAN (ON TV): With or without your-- What is that? Joy Morgan, 308 Laredo Canyon. Well, he must have left his keys someplace. The house call, maybe? Since when did Max attach hearts to his keys? What are you looking so guilty about. The lady didn't leave the key for you. Oh, I'm sure it's innocent. Hey, Laury, wait a minute. That's for Max. Don't open it. Ran off this morning and forgot your key, darling. Without it you can't wake me in the middle of the night with those delicious surprises. Love and passion, Joy. Oh, well it sounds like this Joy is just one of Max's old girlfriends, and she hasn't gotten the message, yet. You know, that you're engaged. Well, he must have had a recent opportunity to tell her, at 308 Laredo Canyon. [music playing] Oh, how charming. I don't know what comes to mind first, heartache or heart burn. Let's see if this key works. No, wait a minute, wait a minute. This is the woman's house. You can't just barge in here. Let's ring the doorbell. [ding-dong] Joy's abroad this afternoon. Well this is lovely. Late brothel period? Well our Joy is a travel agent. See the world, and vice versa. There are rational explanations. What are you looking for? Traces of Max. [sigh] I don't see anything. Come look at this. Thanks for bringing Joy to my life, love Max. Isn't that precious? [glass breaking] Hey, easy. What we have here is a little homemaker. She cooks, she sews, she collects hearts, and she, undoubtedly, knows what goes where in a bedroom. Obviously she's somebody that Max used to know. Used to? His favorite herringbone jacket. Remember the whole there the other day? Well it's been mended since our engagement. So what does that do to your used to? Laury, Laury, wait a minute. No matter what this looks like, Max loves you. Speak for yourself. You know I'd like to, but it wouldn't mean anything. Not until you have it out with him OK, OK, let's go talk to Max, then. [music playing] Want me to drive? [sirens] FEMALE (ON SPEAKER): Dr. Escobar, admitting desk, please. Dr. Escobar, admitting desk, please. Don't lose your head. You don't want to say anything you'll regret. Excuse me. Hi. I really need a cup of coffee. Another rough one, Max? Yeah, seems to be the only kind I get these days. Patient was on the table for four hours and I lost him anyway. Laury, I'm sorry I've been neglecting you. At least you haven't been neglecting everyone. Well, what's this? It's for you, open it. FEMALE (ON SPEAKER): Dr. Graham, admitting desk, please. Dr. Graham, admitting desk, please. Rosie found it this morning when she opened up the bar. I told Laury I knew you could explain. What is this? Why don't you ask Joy Morgan? You do know her, don't you? No, I-- I never heard of her. Well she keeps your picture by her bed. And you know that jacket that needed patching? It was in her closet. Somebody stole that jacket out of my locker a couple of days ago, while I was operating. Laury, I swear. Keys, letter, this is crazy. I swear. You've gotta believe me. I want to, but I don't know. FEMALE (ON SPEAKER): Security officer, please go to 123 West. [sirens] DR. MARTHA TRENTON: Dr. Jacobs, have you seen my son? Yes, doctor. He's still in the pathology lab. Thank you. Good night. Good night. I thought we'd eat out tonight. I made some reservations. I'm sorry, I'm busy tonight, mother. Are you going out? Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. You didn't tell me. DR. PAUL TRENTON: Well, I'm sorry. I was under the impression I was all grown up, and didn't have to clear my dates with you. Have you found another one of those, women? Another one of those women? You mean any blond woman in a bar, who isn't Laury. You remind me of your father. And you reflect all of his inadequacies. What do you expect me to do? Wait around until you get involved in some messy relationship again? And then I have to step in, and save you from making an-- Save me? Is that what you did? I was trying to help you, Paul. That's all I was doing, for Laury's sake. But you managed to lose her anyway. Well you know how I hate to contradict you, Mother, but this time you are wrong. What do you mean? Laury's engagement to Dr. Max Heller is, how shall I put it, suspended. She saw through him. No. I did everything. I made up a note to Max from another woman, and I made sure that Laury found it. And she believed it? She had a fit. Well, she's a headstrong little girl. Who is this woman? She doesn't exist. I made her up. I borrowed the home of a friend of mine, who happens to be away right now. Sprinkled a few suggestive prompts, and let nature take its course. You know, this is the first time I've seen you take hold of a situation like this. Now, I can help, but-- By doing nothing. Oh, Paul. Mother, for once in your life, just let me-- For heaven's sake. You're my son. I love you. I always want the best for you. Dear god, I know that. This time, stay out of it. All right, if that's the way you want it. What about Max? What's he doing? You don't think he'll accept this situation and bow out? He's a street fighter, Paul. Have you thought about what he might do? The way I see it, Mother, there's nothing he can do. [crickets chirping] [music playing] [thump] Oh, it's you. Hi, Max. Oh, don't sweat the piece. I carry paper to make it legit. So far, the only thing it's ever killed was my tailoring. That's very funny. So how do you know my name, huh? You're kidding. Love, Max. That's you, And who are you? My name is Lou, Lou Corbin. How are you doing, pal. Is that yours? The jacket, can I see it? Well I don't think it's any of your business. How did you get in here? Huh? Oh, eh. Oh, boy. So she gave you one too, huh? Well, you know our Joy, generous to a fault, generous to all us faults, huh, pal? What's the matter? Oh, I bet I know, you got a wife someplace, right? Oh, I know how you feel. I used to have one of those myself. Come on, don't be si-- come-- don't be silly, come on. I'm not going to hurt your threads. Because, if I remember correctly, yeah, there it is, exclusively tailored for Max Heller, Max. All right, man, so you know my name, huh? So what is it to you anyway? What are you getting all steamed up about? I just dropped in to see what's cooking with Joy. I thought you might be a burglar. That's all. Where is she? I don't know. I haven't seen her. How about yourself? You don't know? Oh, boy. Seems like the kid just dropped off the Earth, huh? Yeah, it looks like, huh? I'm going to take my jacket off. You must know something about what happened Joy. Because, according to this photograph, the two of you were very close together. Well, you've got a key to this house, too. So your guess is as good as mine, huh, maybe better. [music playing] [grinding noise] All right, now just adjust this to your own eyes. OK, I got it. That's what good news looks like. So these aren't cancer cells? No. In layman's terms, that's a benign tumor. Wow. Ah, a new assistant. Morning, Dr. Jacobs. Well, I asked your son to take me to lunch, he turned me down. So I get a lesson in pathology. Do you have my report, Paul? Yes. Your patient has a benign adnomicist polyp. Well, that's a relief. Oh, Paul, why don't you bring Laury to my party Saturday night? FEMALE (ON SPEAKER): Dr. Richard Stevens, call your service. Laury, we've got to talk. All right, talk. Not here, someplace else. It's personal. I think it's a little late for that. Uh, Joe, I think-- Everyone here knows about Joy. Yeah, I knocked around. And you knew it, but there's nothing between Joy Morgan and myself. Not anymore, I swear it. You did have an affair with her, didn't you? Yes. I lied. I'm sorry, it was stupid. The key threw me. It was Joy's idea of a gag. She's a kidder. She set the whole thing up. Max, I don't think this is funny at all. Uh, Paul, it's their business. Could I see you for just a minute, please? For heaven's sake. He's lying. He's talking about a woman who doesn't exist. You told me-- There is no Joy Morgan. Oh? Well, then, let's pin him down. Max, Max, why don't you ask this woman, uh Joy Morgan, over to our place Saturday night. I'm giving a party. Well, I couldn't. Why not? She could explain to Laury all about her little joke. She could clear everything up. Oh, do it, Max. I think I'd like to meet her. Or, at least, see her. No, Laury, don't. Why not? Well, you don't know her. She'll push the lie as far as it will go. I'd like to believe you. It's important to me. All right. Good. We'll see you Saturday then, both of you. Come on, Laury, let's have a cup of coffee. Sure. FEMALE (ON SPEAKER): Nurse Burke, go to ICU, STAT. [music playing] Hi, Rosie. Usual, please. Where's your buddy, Doctor Trenton? My old buddy is out, spraying around his good work. He is a real sweet guy. A little on the quiet side. You. Thanks. Now your type, we'll have to nail you into a coffin to keep you from wandering. No, not Rosie. A woman as beautiful as you are, you turn a guy on, and then you complain when he's out of control. On top of that coffin, Doctor, they'd better dump a ton of rock. Rosie. You really got a gift with the dames. Me, no talent. Everything I got to sweat for, and then it doesn't work. I gotta tell you I'm really jealous. Care for a little pool? No, thanks. Oh, OK. What are you doing here? I'm looking to find Joy. She was in here a couple of times, with you, maybe. The fact is, I don't know anything about your friend. Nah, come on. It's true. Look, somebody's trying to play a trick on me. They stuck some of my stuff over at her place. Yeah, the inscription on that photo, it's a phony. It's all a scam. Yeah. And the key that you got into the house with, was also part of the set up, huh, Doc? You are a Doctor? I heard the barmaid call you Doc. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm a doctor. On the staff of City General down the street? What is it with all these questions, huh? What is it? Do you always get so annoyed with me? I'm just talking, conversation here, man to man, you know. OK. Man to man, Louie. What is it that you do? Me? Well, nothing like a doctor. I mean, that's really something. As a matter of fact, you know, Doc, I've got a thing, here, in my back-- Why don't you see a chiropractor? Yeah, well, I guess everybody's trying to catch free medical advice, right? If you see Joy, tell her Lou's looking for her. Oh, that's right, I forgot. You're not a friend of hers. Well, I'll see you anyway. FEMALE (ON TV): All right, Dr. Carter, I'll make a deal with you. You don't phone me every time your wife leaves town. Another beer, Doc? No, Rosie. I've got enough. FEMALE (ON TV): Every time the two of you have had a fight. MALE (ON TV): Stop it. You don't have to tell me I've been a fool, I already know it. I'm trying to stop. Please. FEMALE (ON TV): God, don't beg. You getting hooked, Doc? Yeah, maybe I am. FEMALE (ON TV): Be a man, than act like one. [music playing] --they're going to kick me off the floor. Oh, just what I need. Thank you. What about you? No, I think I've had enough. Oh, let's go talk to Mother. Mother? Oh, excuse me. Party seems like a success. Well, I should think so. I've done my best. Yes, well there's a new shift coming on, lady. Prepare to meet thy shaker. Uh, Max, Yeah. I thought you were going to bring Ms. Morgan. Oh, Joy will be here. A client must have kept her late. Come on, Laury. Our turn in the pit. What excuse he's going to use when she doesn't show up? I don't know. He's very clever. You have to be careful with these things. Be, uh, sympathetic, but don't let him off the hook. You don't have to lead me every step of the way. Adam, take some of these around, will you please? Yes, ma'am. Hi, there. You must be Martha Trenton. The hostess, right? I'm sorry, I-- This must be the place. I'm supposed to meet Max Heller. I'm Joy Morgan. Ah, He is here. Look at that, hogging the dance floor, as usual. Come on in, Ms. Morgan. I want you to meet my son. Martha, please, call me Joy. Max has told me so much about you. Good strong woman doctor, had to compete in a man's world before we shoved it down the throats of the little darlings. Good on you. Thank you. My son, Doctor Paul Trenton. Paul, this is Joy Morgan. I, uh, I, uh, Joy Morgan? That's an overreaction. I'm sorry, it's-- you're just not what I expected. I mean-- Oh, no. No, please, don't finish that. I don't know what Max has told you about me, but, uh-- Hey, Max. I made it. Pull yourself together. I'm sorry I'm late, baby, but I did warn you. You know, you've met Mrs. Trenton and her son. This is Laury, to whom you owe one big apology. I'd settle for an explanation. I'm sorry, but you all look so grim, it's delicious. I'm really sorry, Laury, I, uh-- but he needed to be taken down a bit. DR. MAX HELLER: See, everything is a gag to her. Well, he takes himself too seriously. Look, I didn't mean to screw anything up between you two. It was just supposed to be a joke. I mean, yes, I was hurt when he dropped me for you. But then that was then, and now is now. And I have a new element in my life, so, all is forgiven. And what about the key to your house? And the note? Oh, well, that was just a little heart break that I wanted to drop into Max's pocket. And you have to admit, it's pretty funny. You understand now, how this relationship couldn't go any further with her? Oh, thanks a lot, Max. Now why don't you just forgive me, and I can fly away. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Not so fast. I mean, we just met. Lady, I like your style. An unattached doctor, well, the answer to my mother's prayers. But I really can't stay. Oh, sure you can. Come on. Oh, it's tempting. That new element is waiting for me, so. Forgive? Actually you did us a favor. You got us through our second thoughts. Do you forgive me? Yes, but you'd better promise you'll never do it again. Thanks, Joy. But why don't you do yourself a favor? Take it easy on the next guy if you want to keep him, huh? Oh, you can't change a one trick dog, baby. Either he learns to love it, or I'll leave him. As the man said, live well. It's the best revenge. Too bad she turned you down, old buddy. You could have used a laugh. She doesn't exist, eh? I told you she doesn't. Then who was that? I don't know. [music playing] Come on. You were really great tonight. - Was I? Terrific. Come on. Wonderful night. You know what? I love you. And I really love you. I really do. LOU CORBIN: Oh, boy, Maxie, I told you. You've got the gift. Oh, boy, classy lady. How do you do it? Max who is this? Listen, go inside. I'll take care of this. No. Uh, Corbin. Lou Corbin is the name, Ms. Medford. What do you want? Well, I just thought that, maybe, you could give me a line on Joy Morgan. Ms. Medford does not know the lady. That's really peculiar because the way I got to this address was her license plate. It was parked in front of Joy's house. She got in with a key. You must rate high with Joy to get a key. DR. MAX HELLER: Why don't you just get out here? No, Max. I'd like to hear what the man has to say. Come on in, Mr. Corbin. Can I get you a drink? No, thanks, just the same. Tell me, how did Joy come to give you a key? Are you a policeman? Do I look like a cop? No, you just sound like one. Well, I certainly didn't mean to, uh, just curious about the key. Well I acquired it by accident. But, as for my using it, that was just a little misunderstanding. - Oh. Well, you got to admit, that sounds a little bit weird. Mr. Corbin, I don't have to admit anything. If you have a problem, just ask Ms. Morgan. But that is the problem. I can't find Ms. Morgan. Well we just saw her, at a party we attended. You just what? DR. MAX HELLER: We just saw her at a party we attended. She left to meet her boyfriend. What boyfriend? She didn't say, but she's probably with him right now. Where? Where does he live? That's none of our business. So don't ask. She probably is moved in with this new guy, and that's why you can't find her. So if you got something personal about it, then that's your problem. LAURY MEDFORD: Good luck, Mr. Corbin. And I hope you find your girl. Oh, I have a hunch I will. Good night, Ms. Medford. Man, and I'm going to tell you just once. You harass us again. Harass? That a very, very hard word. --and I'm going to break your spine. Do you think you can do that? Oh, yeah, Loui, I can do it. Really. Hmm. Well, how about now? FEMALE (ON TV): Pressure's up. And the wedge is back to normal, stabilizing. Good morning, Mrs. Goodman. You sleep well? Nurse tells me you hardly touched your breakfast and you won't take your medicine. Shh. I've been a nervous wreck all week, but they finally decided to operate. Now what are you talking about? "Doctors in Crisis", my favorite show. Never miss it. MALE (ON TV): Now I remember why I always wanted you with me in the beginning. Well, I'm sure everything will turn out fine. Now take your medicine. No, in a minute, in a minute. There'll be a commercial break. If you don't take your medicine, I'm going to have your television set removed. FEMALE (ON TV): No, Roy, no. Please don't. Not right now. Will you look at that? She won't kiss him. FEMALE (ON TV): I'm worried about her. You'd think since she's having his baby, it's a little late. MALE (ON TV): Oh, Sally. What we do now is wait. I'd suggest praying, but you're not the type. FEMALE (ON TV): Oh, if you only knew how I prayed us. MALE (ON TV): You're joking. You're great in bed, but you never loved me, prayed for me. FEMALE (ON TV): Oh, I've even prayed for your wife. And she dropped dead. MALE (ON TV): Oh, Sally. We can't go on like this much longer. FEMALE (ON TV): What's to stop us. No one knows the truth. See how easy it is to get hooked, Doctor? DR. PAUL TRENTON: Very good. Now, don't forget class will be one hour later tomorrow because of the staff meeting. Dr. Jacobs, clean this up, will you, please? Now, that was easier today, wasn't it? DR. MARTHA TRENTON: Paul? Hello, Mother. Invite Laury for lunch tomorrow. In the commissary? Tell her to come early. She could join me for the tail end of my rounds. She'll love that. Or Dr. Jacobs could take over your class, and you could join us. Say on the fourth floor? About 11:45. All right. Oh, by the way. I owe you an apology. Really? What for? You were right. Joy Morgan doesn't exist. [music playing] [bang] Good morning, Mrs. Goodwin. How are we feeling today? Fine, fine. I brought my son along today, and I'd also like you to meet Ms. Medford. Shh. Do your poking and go. FEMALE (ON TV): Oh, come on, Roy. We can fool the others. But let's be honest with ourselves. This relationship is merely convenient. MALE (ON TV): You know-- Isn't that? Doesn't that look Joy? FEMALE (ON TV): Yes, and the lives of everyone around us. That actress playing the nurse. Isn't her name Joy Morgan? No, that's Elaine Steel. She's real good, isn't she? FEMALE (ON TV): We let the others take care of themselves. Oh, we can't be sure. Joy Morgan had blond hair. You've never heard of wigs, have you dear? Shh. I'm trying to watch. FEMALE (ON TV): Oh, no. MALE (ON TV): What's the matter? Isn't that what you've been begging for me to do? FEMALE (ON TV): Yes, but, uh, not now. LOU CORBIN: Dr. Reed, you're needed in surgery. Dr. Reed. If she wasn't Joy Morgan, why did she say she was? I guess Max put her up to it. Oh, Paul, we don't have any proof of that. Well, it's easy to find out. Why don't you just ask her? [paper rustling] DIRECTOR: Thank you. Good rehearsal. We tape in one hour. I'll give notes to the crew in five minutes. I'll see you in the commissary, Elaine. LAURY MEDFORD: Joy? So this is how you spend your days. Trapped. Max, of course. Of course. Ms. Steel, would you mind if I asked you why? Why did you do it? I just was asked to do a favor for an old friend. I'm sure you know more the why than I do. Oh, Max is an old friend? Yeah, of, uh, nearly any unattached young woman of passable looks in this town. I'm sure you know that. I mean, if you know Max, you know that. Look we were-- just had a few laughs a few years ago. It was nothing deep. And then he asked you to drop by my house, the other night, and pretend you were Joy Morgan? The lad needed an actress. The role called for a blond wig, you know, lots of sparkle, a laugh a minute, good with the boys. Flash in, make points, flash out. I thought I did it well. And nobody was hurt. Wait a minute. Did Max explain who Joy Morgan is? Or why she couldn't come herself? No, he didn't. So all I knew was that no one at the party would know her. So as long as somebody showed up to do the bit, then he would get himself out of some little misunderstanding, and things would work out. Thank you. No skin off my nose. Don't be too hard on Max. He's not the most responsible man I've ever met, but he doesn't want to hurt people. Are you suggesting that he's weak? Maybe a little desperate. So I must get some lunch before the show. That explains a lot. [music playing] Why didn't Max bring the real Joy Morgan to the party, then? I don't know. Maybe he with afraid of what you might say. What do you mean, about their relationship? I guess that's it. I'd like to hear what she has to say about that. [sigh] I think I'll have a talk with the real woman. How are you going to do that? I found out where she works, that's how. Where? Do you have to go back to the hospital this afternoon? Yeah, but not until 5:00. You want to come with me? You can find out. All right. Max, uh, yeah, Joy here. Yeah, a couple of your friends just came by to pay me a visit. The jig's up, baby. Yeah, I think you're going to have to make some pretty desperate moves. Um-hmm. Yeah, take care. Bye. [click] [music playing] [phone ringing] Excuse me. Well, can I help you? Um, yes, uh, when will Ms. Morgan be back? I'm afraid our Ms. Morgan has gone off on one of her little [clears throat] excursions. There's no telling when she'll return. Were you interested in some sort of travel arrangements? Uh, I had talked to her about a trip around the world. Are you sure you don't know when she'll be back? I'm Mary Roberts, and we all work together in here. No, I'd really rather speak to Ms. Morgan. Well, she's not here. She's been talking of going off to familiarize herself with our extended, Far Eastern tour, but who knows? Are you suggesting that she didn't really go to the Far East? Well, let's face it. Joy and men, she gives off a kind of musk that draws them, swarming, if you know what I mean. Anyway, she was talking about a special friend lately. Something serious, something permanent. [clears throat] Interesting that it's a man. There have been times I've wondered which way Joy was inclined, if you know what I mean. Well, not that it's any of my business. So you think that she's off, uh, having an affair with somebody. Well, it wouldn't be the first time. She just leaves us running the office short-handed until she deigns to turn up. Of course, this time, I don't think I can blame her, even though it did cost her her job. I'd probably do the same to snag a doctor. You know how much money they make. A doctor. She told you that? Oh, she loved to rub it in. I'm sure she's playing house with him. Look. Look, there it is. The last entry in her diary. That's the day she left. Look at that. 9:30 PM. Meet doctor at Post-Op. [music playing] Thanks, Rosie. So who are you waiting for, Dr. Trenton or Heller? Now that is an interesting question. Which one am I waiting for? Rosie? Do you know a woman named Joy Morgan? Joy Morgan? Doesn't ring bells. Well, I know she was in here last week. Because I saw it written on her calendar. It could be, nobody introduced us. Well, think about it a minute. Maybe she was in here with Dr. Heller. [door closes] Oh, I'm sorry. I really don't know anything about that. She could have been here with Paul, I mean, Dr. Trenton. Look, Ms. Medford, I like my job, here. And the best way that I know how to lose it is to go gabbing about my customers. What would you like, sir? Any kind of light beer. Good sense. Hi. You always pop into the scene without warning? Only a rattlesnake gives warning. I'm just an old pussy cat. Sounds like our Joy is giving you some trouble. Conversation was private. In a bar? You get privacy in the john. People come into a joint like this just for the chatter, you know? You don't discourage very easily, do you Mr. Corbin? Nah, can't afford it. What is it you do? Oh, this and that. One thing and another. It's kind of like laying brick. You're a brick layer? Well, in a matter of speaking, yeah. One brick at a time until you get a wall, one wall after another, finally you get a house, then you move in. It's dull. It's definitely not you're kind of work. Oh, so you think you know me that well? Well, I can read a little on the outside, sure. Pretty lady all wrapped up in cellophane with a moat around her on the outside. On the inside, steel. I smell a tiger that doesn't give up easy. Is that supposed to be flattering to me? Um, it's only supposed to be a version of the truth. As a matter of fact, judging from what I see, you and Joy are a lot alike. You're a liar. We're not at all-- Tiger kind of got loose on you there, for a second. Would you like to see her? - See her? - Joy. I've got a pretty good idea where she's at. Come on. Where? To where you'll find Joy. Come on. You're always trying to get one up on me, aren't you, Paul? Come on, Max, you can take care of yourself, can't you? DR. MAX HELLER: You're the big survivor, right? Look. Laury saw your friend Elaine Steel on television. Nobody was going to stop her from following that up. And you didn't help her to spot that television show, huh? Hey. You tried to pull a fast one, and you got caught. Don't come in here looking for a goat. It's your mess, you clean it up. But you are always setting me up, Paul I don't want to fight with you, Max. Then, listen up good. You are going to stop sticking your foot in my way, and you are going to stay away from Laury. And what do you want her for? Are you in love with her, I don't think so. I think you need her. Oh, everybody knows that you're not a very good surgeon. But with her connections, and her money-- [crash] I just spoke to May. The nurse in ops. And you know what she said? Boy, she said she saw you coming away from my locker carrying my old jacket. Do you know what you did next? You patched up the sleeve, and then you planted it. Stop that. Stop it. Oh, you're crazy. Let me handle this myself, dammit. What's the matter with you? All right. So I did try to maneuver Laury into changing her feelings about you. Let's go find her, and tell her all about it. Paul, don't be a fool. I'm sick of the lies. Let's get everything out into the open. You don't mean everything, Paulie. Paul, don't do it. Mother, we have to end this. It's out of control. Coming, Max? [music playing] Rosie, have you seen Laury? LOU CORBIN: Well, yeah, she was talking to some guy, and they left together. DR. MAX HELLER: Do you know who the man was? Well, he's been in here once or twice, lately. You know who he is. You we're talking time, right here, just a few nights ago. You know, tall, skinny guy, always smiling. [music playing] [breaks squealing] Laury? Laury? Dammit. Laury? [thumping] Laury? [music playing] Max? Oh, my god. It was him. He must have done it Who? Who're you talking about? The guy she left the bar with. Name is Lou Corbin. I don't think he's dealing from a full deck. LOU CORBIN: Maxie, that ain't polite. You got the medical evidence to back that up, Doc? [grunting] Weren't you the one who was going to break my spine? What did you do to her? You're out of shape, Maxie. What happened to Laury? You're Dr. Trenton, Paul. Yeah, that's right, I've been looking forward to meeting you. Where is she? Who, Joy? Oh, you mean Ms. Medford. The barmaid said you left with her. That's true. She's right, we did. Then we split up. I had a stop to make on the way over, she was going to meet me here. I got here a couple of minutes before you, boys. The door was open, the room was like this. Oh. You don't believe me. Well, what do you think I did with her? Anything, by the looks of this room. Pal, I'm not interested in her. It's Morgan I'm trying to find, remember? Do you know, Joy? Did I say I did? No, I didn't. I'm trying to find her, that's all. What did you do to Laury? Hey, listen. If you think I did somebody in, did somebody some harm, call a cop. Tell him, it's real easy. All you have to do is dial. Here you go, right here. What's the matter, Maxi? Paul? You want a cop? [sigh] Well, that's really interesting. Girlfriend disappears. Two boyfriends positive foul play, neither one of them wants a cop. Yeah, that's real interesting. [music playing] Ha. The night watch. Where have you been? You've been drinking. Probably heredity, wouldn't you say? I've heard father could carve a pretty good hole in a bottle when he was trying to hide from you. What are you talking about? I'm talking about my father. I did have one, you know. Even you can't deny that. He left you, didn't he? You drove him away. I remember him as a quiet, gentle man. You must have made his life a total hell for him to do that. All right. All these years, you've nurtured a wonderful fantasy about a wonderful father, driven away by a bitter, nagging wife. Just don't forget the reason he wasn't home to bounce you on his knee was because he was so anxious to run off, and get in the sack with some cheap blonde in a bar. Cheap blond in a bar? Cheap blonde was what you called that girl you found me with in a bar. Remember? My god, Mother, I've never even seen you like that. If I hadn't been there to pull you-- I lost my head. I didn't handle it very well. You were throwing your life away, like your father. You would have lost Laury. I didn't have Laury, except in your mind. Oh, Paul, wake up. Grow up. She was the only woman for you. Was? Isn't Laury still the only woman for me? Or isn't she around anymore? Oh, Mother. Is there anything you wouldn't do to save me from the devils that haunt you? I'd go to any lengths to protect you, from yourself or anyone else. You're all I have. [music playing] God, help me. [sirens] DR. MARTHA TRENTON: Can I talk to you? Actually, I'd rather you didn't. Max, if I've offended you in anyway, I'm sorry about it. I'm just so worried about Paul. Paul. He came home last night, very disturbed. Have you any idea what could be bothering him? [laughing] What's so funny? He's my son. I don't like to see him upset. I want to help him to achieve the things he deserves. Sure. The disposition of the world, according to Doctor Martha Trenton. You don't understand the feelings a mother has for her son. They're quite natural expressions. Not the way you do it. Forget it. There doesn't seem to be a way to get through to you. Did Paul tell you that Laury has dropped out of sight? - What do you mean? - She's gone. Slid off the chart. Not a note, not a clue. We don't even know where to start looking for her. Well, she could have gone off somewhere to sort things out. She has had a few shocks recently. No. Something has happened to her. Well, that would rattle Paul, if something happened to his girl. My girl! No matter how you twist things around, she is my girl, not his. Oh, why must we always be at each other's throats these days. We all used to be such good friends, Max. You know, sometimes I think you actually believe this little act that you put on. You can be so insulting. Look. Why don't you just take this little present that you and your son dropped on me, huh? We'll close the book on this little scam, it won't work anymore. What is this? The key to Joy Morgan's house. The game's over. What are you talking about? Martha, now stay away from me or I'm going to forget that you're a woman. Hadn't you better keep that streak of violence caged, Max. It might get you into trouble. [music playing] Oh! - Looking for these? - Oh, no, no. Wait a minute, lady. Don't come unglued. These are just sheers, ordinary sewing sheers. Nobody's going to hurt you, honest. Who are you? Name's Corbin, Lou Corbin. And you're the only one I haven't met yet. Dr. Trenton, Martha to all your friends, I bet, huh? How do you know me? [grunting] No! One quick shot, and it's all over. What do you think? You're the doctor. Where does it have to penetrate to kill in a split second. Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I hate it when I lose control that way. Still, I guess, it can happen to anybody, right doctor? Possibly even you? Lost control upon occasion, huh? You think somebody was killed in this room? People get killed almost any place. What were you doing, poking around in Joy's stuff? Huh, Doctor? I wasn't poking through anything. Well what were you trying to find? Something that you left here the last time you were here? Who are you kidding? - I've never been here before. You're not waiting around here for a bus. You were pawing through her stuff. You came here to find something. What was it, Doctor? - All right. All right. - What, what, what, what? Come on. My son had this key. And I-- I was trying to find-- Find what? Huh? What happened to Joy Morgan? Is that what you want to know? Stop that. Stop it. There is no Joy Morgan. No? Well, but her name is on the front door. I don't understand. Believe me, I don't understand. But I know there is no one named Joy Morgan. What gave you that idea? My son. My son said there was no such person. The one next to your son. That's Joy Morgan. [music playing] Paul, I must speak with you immediately. Well, Ma, I'm just about to begin an autopsy. What is it, Mother? Why did you? Why did you lie? Why did you lie to me? Lie, when? There is a Joy Morgan. [pop] What are you talking about? The picture, in her house. I saw the two of you together. What were you doing in her-- Never mind. I saw it. Paul, why did you lie to me? Oh, Mother, stop playing games. Don't you think, under the circumstances, that it was better for you if there was no Joy Morgan? But there is. I recognized her. Joe Morgan is the woman I found you with in that bar. That's right. The cheap blonde that you threatened. DR. JOE JACOBS: Paul? What is it? We're all ready to go. Thanks, Joe. I'll be right there. OK. I have to go, Mother. Paul, don't leave me. Don't leave me alone, please. I'm so scared. I'm not leaving you, Mother. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't. Is your secretary still in the office? Keep her there with you, and wait for me. Don't worry. We can take care of it. [music playing] Sorry, Joe. Well, everything is ready to go. He's all set up for you. Thank you. The cut surface of the left kidney appears grossly normal, with the thickness of the cortex well within the normal range. I also found some evidence of ischemic-- FEMALE (ON SPEAKER): Dr. Paul Trenton. --atrophy, and scar-- FEMALE (ON SPEAKER): Dr. Paul Trenton, telephone. Dr. Paul Trenton. Hello? Operator, this is Dr. Paul Trenton. Would you please have somebody fix the phone in the dissecting room? I don't know. It's just dead. OK. Thank you. [tape rewinding] DR. PAUL TRENTON (ON RECORDING): The cut surface of the left kidney appears grossly normal, with the thickness of the cortex well within the normal range. I also found some evidence of ischemic atrophy and FEMALE (ON RECORDING): Dr. Paul Trenton, telephone. Dr. Paul Trenton, telephone. [music playing] DR. PAUL TRENTON: Marie, this is Paul Trenton. Is my mother there? She's supposed to be there. Did you see her leave? Well, for god's sake, find her and tell her to come to the dissecting room right away. [laughing] LOU CORBIN: Do you want to show her your handy work? Someone's killed Laury. Who? Who killed her, Doctor? OK. OK. All right. Now, take your time, and tell me about it. She was stabbed. It was just the same as-- Same as what? Who else was stabbed, Doctor? Is that the way Joy Morgan died? What are you doing here? Uh, I ran into your friend, Max, outside. He had to leave, but he told me that I could tell you not to worry about Ms. Medford anymore. She came home. He's lying. She's in there. I saw her. Well. Well, let's, uh, take a look. [groan] Well, whoever did that certainly did know their forensics. Where to place the blade, for a quick result. What is that supposed to mean? I'm just trying to put two and two together here, Doctor. This woman was stabbed by somebody who knows anatomy. Or, at least, how to inflict death instantly. And how to use this morgue as a place to hide a body. Are you trying to say that I did it? Well, I'm told that you and Dr. Heller were both in love with this woman, both wanted to marry her. And, uh, she picked him as the better man. Is that true? You think I'd murder her for that? Well, maybe, just maybe, you're the kind of an old-fashioned guy. Who, if you can't have her, wouldn't want him to have her. That's ridiculous Max and I-- Max and you were what? Stop. Stop it. I won't help you do this to him. It's inhuman. [music playing] LOU CORBIN: It's OK. Thank you, for going as far as you did. What are you doing? Paul, I am sorry. I don't know. I didn't know he was going to do this to you. But why did you do it? Because he said if I went through with this charade, it'd help clear up everything. Please believe me, Paul. I am sorry. Come in, please. Paul, are you all right? What are you doing here? This man says you're in trouble. I want to know. Listen, who the hell do you think you are? I'm a cop. - You lied to me. - You had no right. Why didn't you tell us this before? All right. OK. I owe you an explanation. About a year ago, Joy Morgan called the station to report a break-in. I took the call. Uh, we got to know each other pretty well. We were good friends. As a matter of fact, once upon a time, I thought, maybe, well-- anyway, we stopped seeing each other, and that was the end of it. Until this letter showed up at the department on the 5th. Anonymous letter. Said Joy Morgan had disappeared, and something might have happened to her. So, as an old friend, I decided to look into it. I still had my key to Joy's place. I found the usual signs of mail pileups, and so forth, but something didn't jive. And then I got to the big room, and it hit me. It was tidy. Joy was a lot of things, but tidy wasn't one of them. And, of course, the lab guys found traces of her blood on the carpet at the foot of her bed. And, also on these. You recognize them? No. I-- Oh, that's peculiar because the only readable print on them, is yours. Uh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I saw Laury pick those up. I was with her. Oh, really? When was that? Joy Morgan left her key and a note at the Post-Op to cause trouble for Max. And then Rosie gave them to Paul and me. And then-- And you decided to pay a visit to the house, the other woman. Well, it checks out. I saw you both enter and leave. I got a note on it. Look, Lou. All you got is some blood on a rug. Just suppose that somebody was murdered with these. Was it Joy Morgan? But who would want to kill her? Well, lots of people might have had a reason, yourself included. Well you did threaten her in a bar, if she didn't stay away from your son. I didn't know that was her. But that-- that was just an angry outburst. Oh, and killing her? Would that be an angry action? Or a cold-blooded one to keep your son from wasting his life on a cheap blonde. I think that was your quote. A pathology lab in a teaching hospital, it's perfect. Nobody would ever find her, and the way it's going, nobody ever will. And your loving son, head of the Pathology Department. Why, he'd cover for you, wouldn't he? Sure he would. No, don't-- don't say that. Wait a minute, wait a minute, my mother is not involved in this. No, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul! She would say anything to protect me. - Don't listen to him. - All right. Hold on, hold on, Wait a minute. Each of you for method and motive fit the bill. Take Dr. Heller, here. You wanted to marry Ms. Medford. That's quite a package. Beautiful wife, not to mention power and all that money. Was Joy interfering with your plans? Come on, Corbin. I don't have to stand around listening to your wild speculation. Well don't you want to hear the possibilities? For your fiance? Suppose she'd found out about you and Joy Morgan before we thought she did, and killed her in a jealous rage. Well what about you, Corbin, huh? What about you? You more or less told us that she walked out on you. You could have killed her in a jealous rage. Oh, look, I'm-- I am just, uh, supposing, like you've been doing. I mean, you would be the top of my list of suspects, if there was a murder. You can all go home tonight. I'll be back tomorrow with a warrant, and my own forensics team. Excuse me. Paul, would you sign out the body in number three, please. They want it cremated early. Excuse me, Doctor Trenton. Can anybody sign out a body? No, just me. Really. Is that a long standing procedure? No. Paul just instituted it. LOU CORBIN: Really? When was that? Hmm, it was the 5th wasn't it? Uh, yeah, I think you're right. The fifth? Well, the very day we received the anonymous letter about Ms. Morgan. Doctor, there will be no further cremations until I say so. Is that clear? Why not? Because I say so, OK? Max, will you wait on me? I need a ride home. - Sure. Thank you, babe. [music playing] DR. MAX HELLER: Good night. Good night, Doctor. Catherine. You OK? Where do you suggest I look for responsible continuity? I need reports here. I need them in continuity. I work here, Sgt, when I'm allowed to. MALE (ON RADIO): Yes, sir. Batching a black and white with the materials right now. Have you got any idea what you put Ms. Medford through by asking her to lie on a slab? Well, I told her she didn't have to. It was her choice. Yeah, well, you overstepped your powers as a policeman. And I'm not going to let it go unreported. Good night, Ms. Medford. Thank you, again. Good night. [sirens] You sure everything's OK? Something isn't right. Well, what is it? I don't know. Just let me think. [music playing] Stop. Stop the car. Please, stop the car. Laury, we're almost home. - Stop the car-- - Stop it. You've got to stop the car. Put your hands on the wheel. For god's sake, Laury. What's the matter with you? You nearly killed us both. Take me back to the hospital. Why? I don't know. Is it-- it's something somebody said. Please, take me back. [sigh] [engine revs] [music playing] Paul didn't cremate the body. What are you talking about? Basement? What are you talking-- Laury. Paul changed the procedure. You heard what Jacob said. He changed it on the fifth. The same day the police got the anonymous letter. What are you going to do? I've got to see if she's in there or not. Paul cremated Joy's body as soon as he found it. He had to have believed that his mother killed her. He'd do anything to protect her. No, for some reason, he didn't cremate her body. That's why he changed the procedure. So no one could take out a body without him signing for it. She's still in there. All right. Laury. I have to know. Laury! Shh. I love you. I really love you. You see, things could still turn for the worse. Promise me that you'll get help. Max, you think I'm crazy? Laury, you do crazy things. OK, Doctor. You tell me what would've been the normal reaction. The same night a man asked me to marry him, I find him in another woman's bedroom. Believe me, you're lucky I dropped those shears before you came out of the bathroom. Then you were crazy. Angry, darling. Just angry. Now which bin did you put her in? Eight. [tape rewinding] LAURY MEDFORD (ON RECORDING): OK, Doctor, you tell me what would have been the normal reaction. The same night a man asks me to marry him, I find him in another woman's bedroom. Believe me, you're lucky I dropped those shears before you came out of the bathroom. DR. MAX HELLER (ON RECORDING): Then you were crazy. What I said there, it was just a bad joke. It was Paul. He killed her, and he put her body in there, and then he cremated her. That's what you said, Max, isn't it? Paul did it. The letter we got at the, uh department on the fifth, was not, altogether, anonymous. It was typewritten. I traced the typewriter, here, to the lab. Paul admitted that he wrote it. So the answer is, no. A killer does not stir up the police to come after him. Well, maybe his conscience bothered him. I mean, you did check for his fingerprints in that apartment, didn't you? Yeah, sure. But the only prints on the murder weapon were yours. But Paul explained that. Yeah, but the sewing shears that you handled when you were there with Paul were duplicates. I put them there. But your prints also showed up on the actual murder weapon. You don't have a-- a body, anyhow. Paul cremated it. Didn't you? Tell them you did. No, Laury, I did not. I loved her. I had to know. It's a lie. You tricked me. You got me to come here, just to trap me. You can't even prove there was a murder. Joy Morgan is not in there. Ah! [music playing]
