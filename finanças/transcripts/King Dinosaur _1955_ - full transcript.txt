[serious music] [telegraph machine beeping] - [Marvin] On the morning of March 18th at precisely 7:48 a.m. a coded message directed to our president was cabled from this observatory. A message of such vital importance that our Congress was called into an emergency session. A phenomenon out there in space was the subject of these top secret communications. [gentle music] It wasn't long until the astronomers of other nations also discovered what had happened. [gentle music] Earth now had a new neighbor. A new planet had moved into our solar system, and had established its orbit around the Sun so close to Earth that for the first time it was conceivable to believe that man on Earth could actually travel to another planet. A planet that had every indication that its atmosphere would support life. Many of the mysteries of this vast ocean of space would soon be solved. It would be a race between countries to see which one would be the first, the first to bring our civilization to another planet in space. [dramatic music] On April 23rd the word to start comes from Washington, and immediately our finest research laboratories change over to this all important project, the building of a passenger carrying rocket ship. Every security measure is taken. Test upon test must be made to develop, improve, create, invent. [engine whirring] A jet engine must be built with a thrust great enough to launch the spaceship through the many miles of Earth's atmosphere. It must also be able to withstand the pressures found in outer space. [engine whirring] June 3rd. With the aid of unusually favorable atmospheric conditions, Professor Albert Garnet is able with the world's largest telescope to photograph and extremely clear view of the new planet. It is now certain that plant life of some kind definitely exists there. The professor incidentally is also credited with naming the new planet, planet Nova. New metals must be developed with tensile strength capable of expanding great atmospheric pressures. [playful music] Switch on for jet engine test number 87. [playful music] [engine whirring] Structural weaknesses are studied, tested. [metal clanging] [playful music] Every conceivable test for man and machine alike is run the gauntlet. There is no margin for error. Special equipment is developed. This nuclear power plant will serve as an auxiliary source of electricity while our people are on the planet. Actually, because it is activated by atomic power it could supply their needs for many years if something were to go wrong and their return to Earth were delayed. Naturally the people must be careful in using such equipment because if the atomic power were allowed to go unharnessed, an atomic fission reaction would take place. An atom explosion. [playful music] A time clock is a controlling mechanism for this reaction. They of course will understand its use and therefore minimize any danger. [playful music] Pressure bombs are constructed to simulate the pressures found in space. [upbeat music] Record every vibrating pulse. [machine ticking] [upbeat music] Turbo jet engines used in assisting take offs of our giant bombers are studied, but there lies the greatest problem. Blasting the ship off the ground and out of Earth's gravity pull. [engines whirring] The first test rocket is ready. [rocket rumbling] Rocket test number two. [gentle music] [rocket rumbling] This rocket carries animals, white mice. As the rocket zooms upward gravity is still present to hold the mice and little ball downward toward Earth. [engine whirring] Now the mice are floating in air since they are now beyond Earth's gravity pull. [engine whirring] The test proves out. Animals can live in space. It's man's turn next to take the calculated risk. The spaceship is ready now for its passengers. [upbeat music] If animal life is found on the new planet Nova, an expert on zoogeography would be a most important member of the space expedition. On August 10th, Doctor Richard Gordon was chosen to fill that position. He became famous with his discovery of a giant prehistoric tar pits near Salt Lake City just two years ago. [upbeat music] The study of rock formations and its minerals is like reading the personal diary of a planet. Doctor Nora Pierce joined the space expedition on August 27th. Her doctorate in mineralogy was awarded for her mineralogical research in the Himalayan mountains. That same day the giant spaceship was being wielded in position for its space flight which was now a matter of weeks away. [upbeat music] Medicine must be represented on this expedition since the health of these people and the people who will venture into space in the future is of primary importance. Dr. Ralph Martin's war service fortified him with the experience of treating most diseases and fatalities that overtake men, that is on our Earth. The chemistry of the new planet was to be studied by Dr. Patricia Bennet who completed the group of scientists. She was noted for her thesis on the use of radio chemistry in medicine. Dr. Bennet entered the group on September 12th. [gentle music] On October 1st it was observed that the position of Nova was in the most advantageous location for our purpose. The ship must blast off within 24 hours. [gentle music] [tense music] Attention! Attention! The members of the expedition will please report to the ship. Blast off is in X minus 20 minutes. [tense music] [machines beeping] [tense music] Attention! Blast off in X minus five minutes. [tense music] Blast off in X minus one minute. [machines beeping] [tense music] Five, four, three, two, one. [engine rumbling] [wind howling] [serious music] [wind howling] [serious music] [gentle music] The spaceship kept on its course without the least deviation. [gentle music] The people on Earth followed the ship's progress as long as possible with powerful telescopes and with radar. [gentle music] [engine rumbling] [gentle music] To our people inside, the days, the weeks, the months all went by without mishap. [engine rumbling] [gentle music] [upbeat music] [gentle music] [birds chirping] - [Ralph] We're first. - Thank God we made it. Is it as lovely as it seems? - Yes, if it's habitable. [gentle music] An active volcano. This planet is quite young Pat. [gentle music] [birds chirping] We're gonna start our test Dick to see if it's safe to remove our suits. - [Dick] Your instruments are on their way down. Hurry up with the test so Nora and I can get out and join you huh? [gentle music] [birds chirping] - A preliminary biological study made of the air on Nova show the indications of microscopic life not too different then that found on Earth. However, approximately 40% of the bacteria was completely unfamiliar. - [Ralph] Tests for radiation gave a reading of approximately 10% above normal background count. Liquid tested for biotic contents indicated less than a tolerable percentage. - [Pat] Temperature, 78 degrees. - [Ralph] Air pressure, 13.8 pounds per square inch. - Although our preliminary tests are in no way conclusive, they do substantiate however, that human and animal life as we know it on Earth can exist in the atmosphere and environment of planet Nova. [gentle music] [birds chirping] Now let's get out of these suits. - Dick, Nora, the atmosphere checks out all right. It's safe to come out. [gentle music] [birds chirping] The air's a bit richer then oxygen, notice. Anyway let's speed up our reaction. - Oh, you take care of your own reactions Doctor. - What do you think Nora? - This is just great. There's animal life here. There must be plenty of water then. - Listen, I saw a lake over in that direction before we landed. Let's go over and take a look. - [Nora] Okay. - [Dick] All right? [gentle music] [birds chirping] - [Pat] Look, birds. - [Ralph] They look like vultures. [birds chirping] [gentle music] - Look at that tree. [all chuckling] Isn't he cute? [birds chirping] [gentle music] - Well, there it is just like I saw on the scope. Pretty a lake as anyone would want and it's all private. - [Nora] But what about that island? - [Pat] It's a strange looking place. - [Ralph] Looks like it's covered with heavy jungle growth. There's no sun over there. - I'd like to have a look at that if we have time. - I don't see why Nora. All they want in Washington are tests and samples from wherever we land. They didn't say anything about extensive exploration. - You conservative doctors [laughs]. - Well, I don't care. All I can see is that water and that means a bath Nora and let's get some clean clothes and have one huh? - Uh huh. Uh, uh, ladies first please. [playful music] [birds chirping] [gentle music] [birds chirping] Much further? - I want some samples from that rock straight up. [gentle music] [birds chirping] What time would you say it is? [gentle music] [birds chirping] - [Dick] I'd say it's about 3 o'clock Earth time here. - Except that we don't know how many hours there are on the daily cycle here. You know, this place could move around faster then our Earth. - Well, let's figure it's about 3 o'clock anyway. That gives us three or four hours before dark. [birds chirping] [mysterious music] [gentle music] - Dick? That rock might be further then we thought. - Oh, a couple more miles should bring us there. - Couple of more miles as the crows fly but five miles up and down those hills. - Yes, but walking's a whole lot easier then digging. [mysterious music] [birds chirping] - What do you think Nora? [birds chirping] - About the age of this place? [chuckles] Afraid your guess was right. It's pretty young as planets go. Much younger then our Earth. - What era would you say it is? - Prehistoric. - Are you serious Nora? Look, let's get outta here and get back to the ship. I'm scared to death and I don't mind admitting it. - What about it Nora? Do you have enough? - Yes, for the kind of preliminary survey they want. I can get more information while the rest of you are working. [birds chirping] That island. I wonder what's over there. - Well, vegetation certainly looks different from that around here. - Maybe we can pay it a quick visit before we leave. - Let the next people pay it a visit [sighs]. Let's get back to the ship and get outta here before something awful happens to all of us. - We better go, it's getting dark. - Do we know the way? - Well, if it doesn't dark too soon we're all right. [birds chirping] [mysterious music] [birds chirping] - [Ralph] Is this the way we came? - I'm not sure. [mysterious music] [birds chirping] [animal calling] [mysterious music] - Oh, I'm dead. [birds chirping] [tense music] [birds chirping] [Pat screams] [shots firing] [Pat sobbing] - Pat. [Pat sobbing] - Oh, well that does it. - Right. There's not much point in tramping through the woods all night. What do you say we fix ourselves a place and sleep here? It'll be a lot easier to find our way in the daylight. - Fine. [animal calling] [birds chirping] [upbeat music] [birds chirping] - [Pat] One more. - [Nora] All righty. [birds chirping] Hey how 'bout that? Home sweet home. - Looks real good huh? - [Pat] Uh huh. - Step up to the front desk and register. [owl hooting] [thunder rumbling] It's an owl. [Pat and Ralph laughing] [owl hooting] [birds chirping] - [Nora] We're going to be real comfortable. - Well, it's not the Long Gone but I like it. - [Dick] Here Pat, hang this up will you? - Okay. - Ralph, let's get the packs. Now Ralph and I are gonna split the watches three hours a piece. That should take us up until daylight. You girls get some sleep. - There's no reason why we can't take a watch too. - [Dick] Yes there is. - Oh, Dick. - [Dick] No arguments. Now get some sleep. Ralph, I'll take the first one. - Okay. Wake me up a little early will ya? [birds chirping] [thunder rumbling] [mysterious music] [mysterious music] [birds chirping] [thunder rumbling] [mysterious music] [birds chirping] Hey, I thought you were gonna call me? - I'm okay. I thought as long as I felt all right I'd stay with it a little longer. - [Ralph] Looks like the second shift's gonna be a little wet. Good night old man. [thunder rumbling] [animals calling] [gentle music] - [Pat] Hi. - Can't you sleep? [gentle music] [thunder rumbling] [gentle music] What's the matter? - I don't know. [gentle music] [birds chirping] [thunder rumbling] Tell me Doctor, do you still wanna marry me? - You know I do. [thunder rumbling] [gentle music] Let's take a walk. - Oh, okay. [gentle music] [birds chirping] [thunder rumbling] [gentle music] [dramatic music] [Pat screaming] - Ralph! - Dick! [Pat screams] Dick, wake up! [Pat screaming] [dramatic music] - Ralph! [dramatic music] [Pat sobbing] Ralph! [dramatic music] [alligator bellowing] Ralph! [dramatic music] [Pat screams] [birds chirping] [footsteps approaching] Oh Ralph, Ralph, Ralph. - Let's get him back to camp. [birds chirping] [animals calling] - I can't find a kit here. [animals calling] [birds chirping] - Get the kit! [Pat sobbing] Give me the canteen. Get the canteen! [Pat sobbing] [birds chirping] Nora? Get that rag wet. [Pat sobbing] He's lost a lot of blood. - [Pat] Oh, it's all my fault [sobbing]. - [Dick] It's nobody's fault. What were you doing away from this area anyway? You know you're not supposed to leave camp. - I know, I know [sobs]. - You better get some sleep. You're gonna need it. [Pat sobs] We've gotta keep a sharp lookout from now on. [birds chirping] [Pat sobbing] [gentle music] [birds chirping] - How is he? - He's in no shape to travel. We better leave him here. - Not alone. - No, you stay with him. [air blowing] We'll find our way back to the ship and get the supplies. - Oh, Pat we can bring your lab equipment back and then you can work here 'til he's better. - [Pat] Fine. - Just don't leave this area. [birds chirping] We're takin' all but one canteen but go easy on the water. - Okay, but hurry back will ya? [birds chirping] [animals calling] Oh Ralph darling I'm so sorry. [Ralph shivering] - Cold. Freezing cold. [Ralph shivering] [gentle music] [birds chirping] [animal chattering] [gentle music] [gentle music] [birds chirping] [tense music] [dramatic music] [spider chattering] [Pat screaming] [dramatic music] [shot firing] [Pat screams] [shots firing] [spider chattering] [Pat screams] [shot firing] [spider chattering] - Oh Ralph, no! [tense music] [shots firing] [Pat sobbing] [gentle music] Oh! - Where is everybody? - Oh, they've gone. They've gone back to the ship for supplies and equipment. You've been unconscious for a day and a half. - Oh, I don't remember what happened. - You were hurt but you're all right now. [birds chirping] Ugh. - You've been here all alone? - Somebody had to stay with you. Couldn't be left alone. - Well I'm all right now. [birds chirping] Oo. - Take it easy. [Ralph exhales] You know after a bout like you've had you gotta relax and rest. [gentle music] - Come here. - Why? - I need some medicine. [gentle music] [birds chirping] When will they be back? - Real soon. Try to rest now. [gentle music] [birds chirping] [animal chattering] [birds chirping] - Hey, where'd you pick this one up? - We didn't, he picked us up. - That's Joe. - [Ralph] Hello Joe. - Hey Joe, go investigate the lady. Wake her up boy. [birds chirping] - Oh hi. [Joe chattering] Boy am I glad you're back. Did you have a good trip? - Lovely if you like walking. - Anything unusual Dick? [Joe chattering] - What's unusual anymore? Saw something that looked like a Sherman tank but it didn't bother us. - [Nora] Hey, who's the cook in the outfit tonight? - I'll do it. I'll bet your hungry. This one's been eating all day long. - Good. He'll get his strength back faster that way. [Joe chattering] [birds chirping] - Did you find anything today Dicky? Besides Joe I mean. - I got a whole bag full of specimens. Near as I can figure this place will support a lot of people. If we had to stay here for any length of time we should be able to live off the land without much trouble. - Thanks but I'll take Earth, U.S.A. - Me too. Hey, what are the plans for tomorrow? - Well, I thought Nora and I'd finish our tests and samplings and then I thought-- - And then I wanna take a look at that island. - I seem to remember some instructions about not separating. - We haven't run into anything we can't handle Ralph. - You know I think they all read too much science fiction. Probably that would mean some kind of super race up here or something. - Why don't we all go together? - Doctor, you know better then the rest of us that you're in no shape to travel. - That's right. So, Nora and I'll take one of the rubber rafts tomorrow and spend the day on the island. Pat, you, you do whatever work you can around here. [birds chirping] [snake hissing] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] - Dick, what are we gonna do about watches tonight? - I'll take the first one. I'll get some sleep when it gets light. - Hey, I heard that business about the watches. I may be a little weak but I can still handle a gun. - Oh, don't be silly Ralph. You need your rest. - Look, maybe we don't need a watch. Joe seems to be pretty good at shouting alarms. - We'll count on Joe for extras. I'm taking the first one. [birds chirping] [owl hooting] [mysterious music] [birds chirping] [mysterious music] [Joe chattering] [mysterious music] [snake hissing] [Joe chattering] [mysterious music] [snake hissing] [mysterious music] [Joe chattering] [snake hissing] [mysterious music] [animals calling] [mysterious music] [snake hissing] [mysterious music] [birds chirping] [mysterious music] [snake hissing] [mysterious music] [birds chirping] [Joe chattering] [gun clicking] [birds chirping] [Nora sighs] - [Nora] Are you sure you're all right Ralph? - In the pink. There's nothing like a good quiet nights sleep. - If you have to get back to the ship for any reason the best way's along the shore line of the lake. It's too easy to get lost going through the jungle. Nora, we'd better travel light. Gotta pick up that raft on the way. - And by the way, there's a flare gun in each of those rubber rafts. If you're not back by dark you better fire a couple. If you're okay make it white. Any trouble, red. - Better yet, just stay out of trouble. And take good care of Joe, I'm getting very fond of him. - See ya later fellas. - Bye. [birds chirping] [gentle music] [equipment clattering] [gentle music] Maybe you can help me with this. Do you remember any of your chemistry? - Enough to know about the chemistry between us. - Look mister, day time's for business. Let's get this thing over with so we can get home. - That time can't come too soon for me. [birds chirping] [gentle music] [air hissing] - Come on boy. Joe, come on. We're not gonna wait for ya. - Come on, let's go. - [Dick] Let's go, come on. - Joe, come on. [Joe chattering] [gentle music] - [Dick] Let's shove off. [Joe chattering] [gentle music] [birds chirping] [gentle music] - [Nora] It looks pretty barren. - [Dick] This was your idea. - [Nora] Look at the flock of birds. - [Dick] So that's where those vultures have been coming from. There must be something on the island that attracts them. - [Nora] It looks a little forbidding. - [Dick] Hm. That shore doesn't look too bad. Let's paddle over that way. - Aye aye captain. [mysterious music] [ore thuds] [mysterious music] [thunder rumbling] [birds chirping] Listen. - Just thunder. [thunder rumbling] [mysterious music] It's much colder here. [birds chirping] [Joe chattering] I'll put the raft over there. - All right. [mysterious music] [birds chirping] - [Dick] Let's get going Nora. - Here, take Joe. [Joe chattering] [mysterious music] [mysterious music] [birds chirping] [birds crowing] Dick, there's a pair of those birds. [birds crowing] [mysterious music] [birds chirping] - Learn anything? - Fast these things. - Like what for instance? - Like for instance you may be a wonderful doctor but you're an awful patient. - That's a privilege that only a doctor can afford. Seriously, what have you gotten from all of these tests? - Well, for one thing, there's lots of bacteria that exists here that don't on Earth. - Which means stay healthy because there might not be a cure for it, right? - Right. [mysterious music] thunder rumbling] - What a desolate forsaken place. But that rumbling, almost an animal roar. - [Dick] Still sounds like thunder to me. Do you wanna go on or turn back? - Let's go on. [thunder rumbling] [mysterious music] - [Dick] Looks like a cave up on that ledge. [mysterious music] [animal bellowing] - Dick, that isn't thunder. - I know, I know it. [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] [Nora screams] [shots firing] [Nora screaming] [lizard bellowing] [shots firing] [Nora screams] - My gun's jammed! [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] [Nora screams] [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] Lift it up, lean down there, get in it! [lizard bellowing] [shot firing] [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] - [Nora] Joe! Where's Joe? [dramatic music] [Joe chattering] - [Dick] I'll get him. - [Nora] Dick don't go! - [Dick] Take this camera, and load it. - Dick! [lizard bellowing] [Dick exclaiming] Dick! [Nora screams] [lizard bellowing] - Nora, wrap this up. [tense music] Nora! [tense music] [Nora sobbing] [tense music] [Nora screams] [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] Nobody's gonna believe this. [dramatic music] [animals bellowing] Nora, hand be that bearing pistol. - Are you thinking of Ralph and Pat? - I hate to bring 'em into this. It's our only way outta here. [gun clicking] Stay right here. Don't move. [animals bellowing] [mysterious music] - Ralph, something awful's happened. Listen to that noise. - I hear it, I hear it. [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] [shot firing] [gentle music] - Look, the flare. [gentle music] - A red flare Pat. They're in trouble. [footsteps receding] [gentle music] [birds chirping] [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] [triumphant music] [lizard bellowing] [Nora screams] [dramatic music] [gentle music] [birds chirping] [water splashing] [gentle music] [lizard bellowing] - It resembles the Tyrannosaurus rex of Earth's prehistoric age. Tyrannosaurus rex. King dinosaur. To think, this monster dominates Nova just as similar ones dominated Earth 125 million years ago. It's like living in the past. He's a good likeness. - Oh who cares! No one's ever gonna believe us anyway if we ever get out of here! - Nora! [lizard bellowing] [water splashing] [mysterious music] - There's their raft. [gentle music] [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] - Back! [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] [mysterious music] [lizard bellowing] [mysterious music] [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] [mysterious music] [lizard bellowing] - We're closer! In that canyon. [lizard bellowing] [mysterious music] [dramatic music] - Oh, Ralph what is it? What is it? - I don't know. It's something prehistoric. - Oh it's horrible! Here shoot it, do something. - What with? That won't do any good. [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] - Yeah, well do something. We've gotta get to them. - No, they've got to get to us. [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] - Oh! [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] - All right, this is our chance. [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] Let's go! [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] - Over here! - Faster! [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] Oh Ralph, will they make it? - Sure, they're gonna make it. - Oh. - Come on! [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] You all right? - Yeah. - Pat! - [Pat] Oh, baby. - I brought the atom bomb. I think it's a good time to use it. - Oh. [dramatic music] [Joe chattering] - All right, it's set for 8 o'clock. That's a half an hour from now. Come on, let's get outta here. [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] [armadillo grunting] [dramatic music] [shots firing] [dramatic music] Go out that way! [Pat screams] [armadillo grunting] [dramatic music] [Pat screams] [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] [all screaming] [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] - Come on, let's go! [Pat screams] [shot firing] [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] [shorts firing] - Keep goin'! Don't stop. [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] [mammoth trumpeting] [dramatic music] - [Ralph] Get back, hurry up! Come on! [dramatic music] - [Dick] I think we've lost him. [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] [animals bellowing] [dramatic music] [Pat and Nora screaming] - [Pat] Hurry! - [Nora] Hurry! [Pat screams] - [Ralph] Come on! - [Nora] Dick! [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] [water splashing] [dramatic music] [lizard bellowing] [dramatic music] [water splashing] [lizard bellowing] - Leave from that hill over there. Let's go, hurry! - Oh no! - Hurry up Nora. - [Dick] Come on man! - [Nora] I can't! - Yes we will, come on! Get over there and stay down! [Pat screaming] - [Ralph] Okay, settle down. - [Pat] Let go of me! - Come on Pat! Come on! - [Pat] Oh! [dramatic music] [explosion booming] [Joe chartering] [air howling] - Well, we've done it. - Yeah. We sure have done it. Brought civilization to planet Nova. Come on. Let's go home. [gentle music] [triumphant music]
