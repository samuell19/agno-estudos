What are you afraid of? The whole bus stinks anyway. Ariel? - What? Will we get rooms or tents? Let me listen. That's some music... Mine. - It's yours, it's yours... Get off the bus! 20 seconds! Move! Form groups of 3! 15 seconds! 10 seconds! 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Company, stand at attention for the commander! 2... 3... - Attention! Attention, company B. We're here as reinforcement to calm things down in the area. If there's anything unusual, straighten it out. Don't ignore any rocks being thrown, any spitting or any PLO flags. We'll stop this whole mess in 2-3 days, a week tops. You'll get 2 types of magazines. One is red, the other is blue. The red magazine has live bullets. The blue one has rubber bullets. Do not use live bullets unless you're told to by an officer, in order to save your lives. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Now commander Nir has something to say. How are you doing, company B? - Fine, sir. If you see a terrorist with a Molotov cocktail don't shoot. Try to stop him. Even if he lights the cocktail, don't shoot. If he is about to throw the bottle, only then can you shoot to kill. If he throws the bottle don't shoot. The same goes for bricks. You'll be entering houses with women in them. No giggling, blowing kisses, looks or touching. They're sensitive about that... What did we know then, at the beginning of summer? Not much. Like many others, we were sent to a place we didn't know. A place close to our homes, which we heard about on the news and from stories of our fathers, who fought there. After the peace agreements, nobody wanted this land. Nobody wanted Gaza. Shooting instructions. - 'Stop. Stop or I shoot.' A shot through the air, a shot near the legs, a shot to kill. You're a joker, huh? Go... Get lost! What? You like soccer? Maccabi? Football, soccer... A rifle? Why do you need a rifle? Leave him alone, he's a little terrorist. Fuck off! Aki, Izak, come here. All the rest, go secure the area. Tamer... go ahead. Cover the area. Put it out. - What? Come on, put it out. - I'm not putting it out. I am a city hall member. Ask the children. Aki... - Are you making trouble? Put it out. - Wait. Wait, I'll go get some water. - Hands off! Go away! Wait, I tell you... - Clean it up. Don't push me! I'm putting it out. Go home, kid. - Iliya and Izak... Go! Get them out here. Bring water, Sabiha. Go home, kid. One moment! Lower your voice! Come on, get out! Come here. Give me your ID. - Why? Because I said so. You two, come with me. You enjoying this, Aki? See this flag? See it? Good. Now take it off. No questions. Son of a bitch! You see them? - Up on the roof! To the right. - There he is! Aki, stop! - Aki, don't go alone! Son of a bitch! - Only rubber bullets! Only rubber bullets! Move back! Aki! Iliya, Izak, only rubber bullets! HQ, send backup to section G-3, ASAP! Molotov! Son of a bitch! Medic! Shoot him already. - You shoot. Shoot! - You shoot! I don't need a dead kid on my conscience. You think I do?! - Like I give a shit! Get the fuck away! They're fucking nuts! Iliya, are you okay? Iliya! Come with me! 'Sot him! Look up! Look up! All eyes on the rooftops! Arrest him. Come here, you bastard! - Aki! Come here, you shit! Relax! Iliya, move the hell away! Put the rifle down, you idiot! What do you think you're doing?! Sit. Medic. I'm coming. - Take care of him. Iliya, look there. Leave my son alone, he didn't do a thing! Get out of here! - He didn't do anything. He didn't do anything. He's just a little kid! He didn't do anything! Have mercy on us! Go home! Get her away from me! Get her away from me! We have to break up, it won't work between us. Have mercy! Stop it! Stop! Get her away from me! It won't work between us. He's getting away! - Iliya! Away! Iliya, let him go! - Iliya, stop! Tomer! - Don't let Iliya go alone! God damn you, you Jew! Why did you do that?! Get out of our home! Iliya! Iliya's dead! Iliya! - Iliya's dead! Go to hell! Come on! Look who I found. Iliya, watch out! Medic! Medic! Iliya! Get up! Medic! Iliya! Get up! Dead. Medic... - Move away! Don't go into shock! How bad is it? One or two flowers are down... Aunty, watch the kid. -What's going on? - Quick, take Walid! Get in! Ariel, check that area. Shut up! There are little children here! Go blind! What's going on?! Aki! Aki! - Sit! You bastard! Aki, I need you with me on the stairs! Go up! Go, go, go! Curfew, curfew... Do not exit your homes! Curfew, curfew... What are you looking for in the fridge? Curfew, curfew... Enough, my sweetie. Excuse me... Come with me. Come here. The two of you, come with me. Curfew starts now! To all the residents, curfew start now! It is forbidden to exit your homes! Come here. ID. Check him on the 'bingo' list. Did you see who threw the washing machine? -Yes, sir. There were two, 16 or 18 years old. We shot at them. One of them fell and hurt his leg. They ran away like roaches. - Roaches? They really screwed us. - You thought they'd wait for us? If you'd let us use live bullets, they'd be dead. Come here. Is this yours? The washing machine down there is yours? No, it's not. It's not yours? - No. Whose is it? I don't know. They didn't throw it from here? - No, not from here. They did. Don't argue with me. They didn't throw it from here. Could it be from somewhere else? Maybe... from there... Yes, from there. I'm sure they did it from there. - From there? -Yes. Want me to take you to the Secret Service? Why? It's not from here. - Don't lie. Maybe they did, but it's not mine. Liar... - How do you wash? My wife washes by hand. - So you know nothing about it? Nothing. Good. Watch over the area, the rooftops, the alleys. Anything unusual, even a kid running, let me know. I have good news for you. - Thank you. My soldiers are on your roof until further notice. -What? Listen... wait a minute... If soldiers stay on the roof, people will kill my husband. They'll call us collaborators. Excuse me, officer... - You're going to the Secret Service. Wait for me there. Come here, Ariel. Listen up. You're all staying here this weekend. From now on you're watching from the roof. You go up in the morning, leave at night. You make sure nobody throws anything from the roofs on the patrols. I want the guys who did it. You saw them. Let's You're coming with me. What are you doing? It's Iliya's blood. Ariel... I want you to command. - What? You're the roof commander. - Come on, Israel, I'm discharged next month, I don't need this shit. Pick someone else. - Haliva's orders. Okay, Aki, Tomer, take your positions. Aki, go to the corner, eyes down. Tomer, to the corner. Neighborhood watch. Shit... Go get the ball. - Come on, Abed. -I'll get it. They killed Iliya! - How do you know? I can smell them a mile away. Let's fuck them up! Aki, rifle down. Put it down. Let's go. Eat. Our military correspondent, Moshe Shlonski. Beside the economic blockade in the Territories, the IDF developed a new weapon, ?the stone thrower?. Yuck... - It throws stones at demonstrators... It looks like vomit in a can. Eat it with bread. We eat what we have. Eat. I don't feel like it. It's stupid that we can't shoot them from the roof. Complain to the Chief of Staff. Does catching them even matter to you? You weren't Iliya's friend. Leave him alone. You didn't watch over him. - I said, leave him alone. Go to sleep. He joined the combat unit because of me. I convinced him. I didn't want to be alone. Are you done? Asshole. Go to sleep. Here's to Iliya. To Iliya. At least he won't have to eat this crap anymore. He really loved this shit. Where have you taken my son? Tell me where you took him. Answer me. Why don't you answer me? Where did you take him? You took him. Tell me where. Go away, lady. - Where's my son? I want my son. My son, Maruan! Answer me, my love, if you can hear me. Curfew. Don't leave your homes till 13:00. Curfew, curfew. Don't leave your homes till 13:00. What are you doing outside?! Get inside! Get inside! My dad used to come here to eat humus on Saturdays. It looks like yummy humus. Stop talking about food. My stomach hurts. Nobody buy humus, pita bread or New Years cards. Wanna be poisoned, idiot?! What do you want in your pita bread? Already? It's only morning! God help us. They don't even let us eat in peace. Hi. - That's it. What's it? - You're not going up on my roof. What?! - You have no permit. Yes, we do. - No, you don't. Yes, we do. - You don't. Why are you nice to them? - What should I do? Don't be nice. - I won't open the door... Excuse me. Excuse me, you have no permit to come in. I checked with the military authorities today. I'm going to the authorities now. - Do it. Go tell them what happened on your roof. Go! Are we going up? - Wait, Ariel... Mohammed, can I use your toilet? Go ahead. Are you serious? - Yes. But I'm sweating like a pig. Eat an egg. Lower your hand. Don't play with him. Poor people... -They shouldn't throw washing machines on us. Who said it's them? -Who said it's not? They're not innocent. Either way, they're happy about it. If this happened in Jordan, they'd butcher everyone. Ariel? I see people on the roof. Damn it... Get off! What? - Come down from the roof! I told you to go down! 'Come back quickly. Love you always...' 'Always' or 'Only'? - 'Always'. 'Love you always, even when you're far away. Love, Shiri.' Your girlfriend? Yes. She's an Education soldier in Jerusalem. You mean, those girls who teach about Israel? Poor idiot. Sum the teacher. Oh, she's well-known? Does she give discounts for organized groups? Just kidding, Tomer. Relax. What's that? My ex-girlfriend's pussy juices. Want to smell it? No, thanks. You can smell it later. Why is she your ex? Would you date someone who comes home once a month? Get used to it. Somebody's coming. It's Iliya's father. Yes. Hope he doesn't come up here. They ambushed him from the roof. Why did you jinx it, moron? You all know Iliya's father. Tomer, tell him what you saw. We saw him. He caught the kid under the building. They threw down the machine before we could do anything. That's what happened. Iliya was a hero. They'll pay for this, don't worry. Negative, very bad, very bad. Changing to a secondary channel. Samira, bring some water. Aharon, have some water. Pardon me, officer sir, mister officer... You have no right to be here. The authorities said so. Mohammed, go away. You're out of line, go away. Pardon me, but you're also out of line, officer sir. What are you even doing here?! Why bring these children here? What for?! It's stupid! Why did you put my son here? Why did he have to die?! What did he die for?! Mama?! Mama?! My Son! Where's my son? Where have you taken my son? Tell me where you took him. - Go away. Tell me where he is! - Go on! You took my son. Tell me where's my son. Is he inside? What's with you? - What do you want from me? You keep doing this. - Leave me alone. Why don't you talk to me? Answer me. Mama?! Tomer, Aki... ls there any food left? Only canned meat loaf. Something awful happened. We lost Iliya. Unfortunately, these things can happen. This is Dr. Friedman from the Mental Health Service. I want you to talk about whatever's troubling you. In cases like this, it's best to talk, not hold it inside. It won't make you less strong if you talk. On the contrary. If you want to talk, I'm at the authorities. Come at any time. Shut up! Enough! Turn it up. More. Higher, all the way. Higher, I can't take this. Turn it up all the way. - That's the highest. He thinks that if he yells it really loud then it's true. God up my ass! - God up my ass! God up my ass! Let's see you! Son of a bitch! - Fuck you, you asshole! Shut up. Kid, I'm asking you nicely to shut up. You faggot soldier! Just wait till I catch you. I'll kill you all! You'll never catch them. - Is that so... Just wait. Shut up! Don't fuck with me, I'll tear you apart! The fucker's on the machine! Stop it! I'm going down to kill him! - Aki, they're just kids! Tamer, go get 'rim. Up yours, soldier! Come here, you son of a bitch! Relax, they're kids! - Shut up! Move! They're short terrorists! 'Just kids'?! It's just a game! A game?! Don't fuck with me! - Soldier, you son of a bitch! Who threw down the washing machine? Answer me! Who was it? You think you can fool me, huh? You can't fool me! I know it came from your home, I'm not stupid. Tell me who did it. Tell me who did it, bitch! Who killed Iliya? Who was it?! Don't piss me off! Fuck! I told you not to go down. I don't need any private initiatives, Aki! Let's calm down, okay? Pick up the rifle. I'm not calm when I get peed on! We're watching from the roof. That's what we have to do. If something happens, we report it. That's it. I won't let these bastards humiliate me! I'm your commander, do as I tell you. You're a commander? You're a joke. - Watch it. What will you do to me if I don't?! Shut up! In your mind you're already getting high in Amsterdam. From your mouth to Allah's ears. Faggot soldier, come and shoot me! Faggot, let's make a kid. Where'd the donkey come from? I'm shooting it. - It's like shooting the Israeli flag! If you shoot it, I'll shoot you. What did it do to you?! - I don't give a shit! You're nuts! What's with you?! - Relax! Enough! Enough! Stop it! You son of a bitch! - Sit down! Give us just 5 minutes of peace and quiet! Okay?! Go guard. I'm sick of this! I've been guarding all day! I'm stuck here with a bunch of idiots! Why did you shoot at the donkey? The Israeli flag is painted on it. Get moving! Sing! Get in. Sing! Rice and peas, rice and peas, I like the border police! Why isn't your hair covered? Go inside! Are you the roof squad? Yes. - Don't worry. We'll catch the SOB who killed your soldier. Go ahead, get him out. Those animals... A month from now I'll be in Amsterdam. I'll get you a room at Bivka's. Forget all this shit. Yes, sing it loud! Hi, Haim. - What's up, Ariel? If you're in the army Learn the new lingo It might not be Hebrew But it's the daily language If you're in the army Learn the new lingo ?Chuku? ls an uncontrollable mess When you can't even find your bed in the tent ?You're in trouble? means ?watch it? ?Atomic missile? means ?be careful?... Haliva, Haliva, what are the orders for tomorrow? The girl on the right looked at you, Haim. Go for it. No... she looked at you. - No, no. She looked at you! You have to go talk to her. Hello, is Shiri around? I'll call her over. Hello? - Hey, sweetie. Hey, baby. I'm not coming home this weekend. Me neither. It's a mess here, many soldiers were called on urgent duty. I dying to be with you. - Me too... 'He who dreamed and still dreams...' Promise me you'll be very very careful, and that you won't do anything dangerous. Don't be a big shot. Tell them you have to come home... - Come on, Shiri, we 're waiting. One second. I love you. - Me too. Come on, Shiri! - See you at home. Bye, sweetie. Go get her! 'He who loved, many loves will await him 'He who is gone shall never return...' Are you headed back to Tel Aviv? Yes. Lucky you. Are you from Tel Aviv? Yes. Forget it, they're trash. '...He who died will never see that.' Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart. Good morning. - What's up? Enjoying yourself? No. If I were stuck here for two years like you, I'd get the hell out of here. Hey, asshole soldier! There are no hotties here. Same hotties you see in Rishon Le'Zion. Dude, the Palestinians are Jews Islamized by Salah El Din. Same pussy, pal. - You'd settle for anything, huh? Shut up, wanker. We saw you last night: 'Are you girls from Tel Aviv?' You're an ape. You have one neuron in your brain that says, 'this I can fuck, not this.' This you can't. True, but I haven't been home in a month. I'm horny as hell. Yeah, the army is shit. - The commandment doesn't get us. If I were Chief of Staff I'd hire us strippers instead of the army band. I'd vote for you, Haim. The dog's balls look like yours. - Hey, what are you doing? Hey, leave it alone! Leave it alone! Get out of here! What's all the fuss?! - Soldier, you son of a bitch. I'll fuck you both! Get the hell outta here. What are you doing with this dog? - I'm taking him. Where? - To the roof. What are you, the Red Cross? You're flying over the ocean and my dick is a rock. Where will you land? They're coming. What do you want me to do? Do something, don't sit on the sofa all day. And tell them that my nephew threw the machine? Don't you dare open the door. Okay, I won't. Good morning! Open the door. Decide what to do. Mister officer, I don't have money to fix the door. The authorities said you have no permit to be here. Right. - You can't come in. A - I'm no officer, okay? B - we have a permit. If the authorities don't want us here they'll tell us so. Till then, we're here. Okay? Good. No, it's not okay. They've got some nerve... Is that a dog?! No dogs allowed! No dogs allowed. - But he's cute. A dog is dirty. - A dog is good. No, a dog is defiled. No dogs allowed. - Defiled? You're so cute... You're defiled! You come here with dogs, you dogs?! Dogs are defiled! Shame on you! Defiled... Come here, boy. Come here. We have to name him. - 'Filth' suits him perfectly. Or 'Coli', after the germ in your ass. Co?! Co?! Idiot... Let's call him Arafat. What's the matter? I have to take a crap. - You stay. That's an order. Do it in the dovecote. Fuck it. - Where are you going? I'm here, I'm here. No! It's dangerous. Hands up! Hands up! You're a disgrace to the IDF. He shot you after you surrendered. It's against the Geneva convention. Do it with the rifle. Hands up! - No... With the rifle. This? - The rifle! No, it's forbidden. - The rifle! No. - Rifle! Yeah! Hands up! Walid! What are you doing? - We were playing, it's empty. I told you a thousand times! We were playing. - Don't ever come up here! You're deteriorating the area, Tomer. Gross! Arafat, don't eat my shit! What 'Arafat'? Shame on you! - Bad boy! Clean it up, Haim, it stinks. You disgusting animals! Go to hell! Gross... Go to hell! Are you guys sleeping? - No. Tamer, some here. Damn it, I'm riding with Haliva. - Cool, a day out. Mister officer, it's not okay, you have no permit. -Okay. I asked the authorities. - I'm your permit. Mister officer... We'll get you one. - You can't stay on my roof. Not good for my family. People say I'm a collaborator. They won't sell us food. Bicycle... bicycle... Walid, I told you to stay away from the soldiers! Come here, I told you a thousand times! Wait a second, okay? Tomer, help me out here. Excuse me, mister officer... Dismissed. - But I have children to care for. So do I. One of them died under your roof. It's not only your soldiers who die. - Go home. Get inside the jeep. Go home. Go inside. Go home. Take off your helmet. Where in Israel are you from, Tomer? Haifa, sir. - Haifa, ay? I banged a girl once in Haifa. A student from Moria street. You know that street? Yes, sir. It has these curves. I'd take them with my motorcycle. It was great. We used to skateboard there as kids. Skateboard, huh? They kidnapped a soldier today from a bus stop in Netanya. We have to fuck them up. The whole thing is awful. It's the most beautiful beach in Israel. Isn't it? Nicer than Dado beach. I don't get what we're doing here. We should get rid of Gaza and shove it up their asses. Let them fend for themselves. They'll kill each other along with this fucked up Middle East. We need this place like we need another hole in our ass. Gaza can suck my dick, Arafat can suck my dick. Gaza can suck my dick! Arafat can suck my dick! That was fun. I want to see the mental health officer, sir. Are you nuts, Haifa? Relax, Haifa. We all go through it. So did I. I don't belong here. You're fucked up, you know? You know that? Yes, sir. Haifa, do me a favor. Can you? Go sit there. Go on. How can I go if you grab my wrist? Go sit there already! Wait! Let's find out who did it and get the hell out of here. Him. No, him. Yes, him. You recognize him? I don't know. His friends ratted him out. I can't remember, it was too far. Try harder. It was from high up. We got one of them, he fell and limped. Don't worry, we'll catch the limping one and the redhead. I don't remember him. Okay. Take the detainee to the HQ building, to Jimmy from the Secret Service. Tell him it's from Haliva. That's how you communicate with them, like donkeys. You a donkey? Wait, he's mine, I have to give him to Jimmy. We've become an Arab FedEx. Go ahead. Come on! Go on. Is this for Jimmy? Very good. Maybe they'll get him to talk. Fuck! Shit on rye! We drove over Ninjas! Come on, throw, throw! - Enough already! Enough! -Fuck you soldiers, I placed the nails... Get them! Kill the soldiers! Rice and peas, rice and peas, I like the border police! Rice and peas, rice and peas, I like the border police! I should have joined the border police. The train to 'your mother's ass' leaves now! Crap! Lost him? They got mixed up. - You're such an asshole. Here, this is him. That's not him. Leave him alone. It's him. Come here already! It's like in the commando: If you are not dead you get stronger and if you are dead it makes Mom stronger. Izak, you moron, let him go, it's not him! -It's not? You feel sorry for him? - No, it's not him! They all want to kill you, you know why? Because the killers of Iliya are going to heaven. Heaven. Ain't it great?! Goodies! I brought goodies! Why the fuck here? Go on, take them to custody. You take them. I'm done! Get up. UP! Who's the guy I brought? Tell me who's the guy who escaped. Who's the guy that I brought into the truck? I don't understand what you want... - Who killed Iliya? I swear, I don't understand! If you don't tell me who killed Iliya, then you killed Iliya. Don't you understood?! - I don't understand. You're a dead man, you understand? - I don't understand... Where are you taking me? I didn't do anything. Let me go, in the name of God! Excuse me, do you know where Jimmy is? What Jimmy? -From the Secret Service. -I don't know. Let me go, I don't want to go with you. Where are we going? Tell me where we are going. I'm looking for Jimmy. - Soldier, are you nuts? Get this Arab outta here! - Sorry, sir, I had orders. Where am I? Please help me! Please... I know Israeli singers. I didn't do anything! Please! Let me go, I didn't do anything! Where are you taking me? 'Mental Health Officer' Hello. - Hello. You have a sec? Is it urgent? You have a referral? I just came from Shati refugee camp. I have to hand him over to Jimmy so I thought... maybe I could talk to you. If it's possible. No problem, I'm here. Turn him in and come back. I also need a doctor. Take him where he has to be and come back. Please... I don't want the Secret Service! I'm a human being! I'm a human being! I don't want the Secret Service. Someone help me... Oh, shit. Anyone here? Jimmy? Fuck Jimmy! Who's there? - Maruan Jamil. Mama??! Where are we, Maruan'? In Satan's asshole! Mama?, answer me! Where are we? My son Maruan is in there. Is he in there? Let me see my son Maruan. - Go to the HQ. My son is inside there. - Go to the HQ. Go to the HQ and look for him there! -Go to the HQ. Please let me see him! Let me see him! Let me see him! - Leave me alone! Let go! What's wrong with you? - It's my son! You took my son! We were sent out to Gaza And went back in We were called to the flag On behalf of the nation Our best combat soldiers Our best men... Good morning. - 'Good morning', you brought the dog, you dogs? She's got a pretty face, huh? What do you think? 'Rock the Casbah - November '89' I don't feel well. Tell your stomach to hold on another 23 hours. I'm going to die here. And stop farting. Want a puff? It'll do you good. Such a cry-baby... What a sissy! - What is this? Iron, Iron, this is HQ. There are PLO kites allover the area. What's going on there? This is stupid... Shoot them down! Tell them I want aerial support, okay? Fine. Tamer, what's up'? Leave him alone, he's a pure hearted pacifist. He's hurting inside. Are you okay? In 20 years I'll have half an acre near my dad on the farm. I'll work in high-tech. Shiri will be a successful journalist. - What? Tom will play the piano and Tali will be a dancer. On Saturday mornings they'll run over to our bed. I'll pretend I'm sleeping. Shiri will crack. We'll have breakfast in the yard, then go hiking. We'll stop on the way back for pictures and coffee. When the kids fall asleep in the car, Shiri and I will share a moment near the Jerusalem junction. In the evening we'll make soup from the mushrooms we picked. Tom will tell a joke and Tali will say the food's too salty. We'll go to sleep happy, no flaws. I know we'll have a happy life. With no flaws. Ariel? - What? Come on, let's go get humus. Enough with the humus. That's it, no more humus. Why? - Why what? Why not? - No humus, that's it. Nobody would know. - You have a stomach ache, right? That's cause we've been eating shit. Enough with the humus. I don't want to hear about it. What's your problem? We're out of here tomorrow, you dick. Just let us get humus. Let them have their fuckin' humus so that they shut up! Let's go, Haim. - What are you doing?! Aki! Again?! Aki! Haim! - We'll be right back. What do you mean, 'right back'?! Haim! I'll court marshal you! You'll be court marshaled! God damn it! You worry me. You're both going to jail! To jail! Get us some in pita bread! No hot sauce! You want to order? - Yes. We'd like 2 humus platters, 2 cokes and 2 more platters to go. We only have Bepsi Cola. - Then get us 'Bepsi'. There you go. It's like carbonated tea. It's best if you go away. What do you want? I'll handle this. You're not welcome here. - We'll finish our humus, drink our 'Bepsi' and leave, okay? It's our country and we have the right to be here. Thank you. Watch it. This humus isn't yours, neither is this city nor this country. Go back to Tel Aviv. - So come to Tel Aviv. Be my guest. Tel Aviv isn't yours either. Okay... They're having a humus party. Come back, you shits. Hands up! Hands up! Move aside. Move aside! If I catch another soldier here, I'll close you down! Make me some coffee. Kid, give me the grenade. - Tomer, get the grenade. It's dangerous. - Before it explodes. Hands up! Shoot mm, Tamer. Throw him off the roof for all I care! Follow him! Fuck it! Kid, give me the grenade. - Go home! Hands up! You want to die? Hands up! Kid, give me the grenade. Hands up! Hands up! Allah is grand! Are you crazy?! I've told you a thousand times, I've had it, you're grounded! Go up there, move! Who do you think you are, huh? The madam of this whore house? They went down... - Shut up! All I'm saying... -You're the commander and you let them get humus?! You're going to jail for a long time, mark my word. What's this? What is this thing? It's our dog. 'Our dog'... You've opened a petting zoo. Get rid of him. - What do you care if he's here? Shut up. Get rid of him. You want diseases?! Did you hear me? It's just a dog, Haliva. Haliva, it's only a dog! What did the dog do to you? That's so Nazi of you! Soldier, soldier, soldier! You piece of shit! Why don't I throw everyone from the roof too?! You want to commit suicide? Go on, jump. Let's jump together. It's just an Arab dog! I'll punish you all! Haliva, you're a fucking bastard. What did you say? That you're a fucking bastard. You're all going to jail. I'll rip you open from top to bottom! Throw me in jail. Throw me in jail! Any place is better than here. - I'll throw you from the roof! While you were eating humus, the soldier who was kidnapped yesterday was found slaughtered! Where do you think you are, you spoiled brats? Molotov! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir, they blew up the jeep! Load the live bullets! Attention. Take the flag off. Enough already! Go away! It's my home. It's my home. It's my home. Go away already! Stay close to the wall! Take cover! - Leave us alone already! Enough! God is grand! Don't be exposed! Aki, go up to the roof! Move, move, move! That's the guy who killed Iliya! - Chase him! Follow him! Don't leave him alone.
