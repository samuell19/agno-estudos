You can have all the hock hoofers from here to Hawaii. Give me that Jerry Wheeler for my dancing. She's certainly a terpsichorean. I'm sorry we only accept ladies with escorts here. But I don't want a table. I'd like to see Jerry Wheeler. It's important. Get inside. Thanks. Mary. Only two more minutes. Okay. What's up, honey? Chick. Quarrel? He's leaving town. So what? He'll be back in a few days and then-- You don't understand,Jerry. He's going away with that woman. Ruby Rose? They're leaving for Chicago in two hours. Chicago? But Chick hasn't got that kind of money to spend. That's what worried me. Otherwise, I've never come to you about his going away. Do you think he's using the firm's funds? I don't know but he's been spending more money lately than he earns. -Jerry I-- -Where does she live? The Milton Arms Apartments. She might be easier to get at than around. Come on. I'm going to bat with Ruby Rose on her home grounds. Where are you going? You got to give me time off for about an hour. Wait a bit. This is no-- My brother's in trouble. That's too bad but you can't walk out on the customers now. They're waiting to hear you sing. I'm sorry but this is important. If you leave now, you needn't come back see? Okay. Come on. You run on home kid. I wanna see her alone. -But it's my-- -Please do as I say. Here, this will take care of it. Sit tight till you hear from me. Good luck, Jerry. Good evening. Uh, where is Ms. Ruby Rose's apartment? Uh, is she expecting you? Oh, yes. Uh, 4th floor, number 27. Who do you wish to see? Ruby Rose. Tell her Jerry Wheeler is calling. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, Ms. Ruby isn't in. All right. Skip the Morse code. I can smell the varnish she's sampling. You can't come in here. I'm Chick's sister. Well, do you always barge in where you're not wanted? You stupid, bungling nitwit. I told you I wasn't seeing anyone. Ma'am I couldn't help it. Oh, shut up. All right. Start the audition. Want it private or with a gallery? Wait a minute. Take Pom-Pom over to the kennels on 7th Street and leave him there. And don't take all night. I'm shoving off in an hour. I've come to ask you to lay off my brother. Well, what am I supposed to have done, cured him from wiping his nose on his sleeve or something? Cut the sarcasm. He's been spending dough like wild and it hasn't been coming out of his salary. No? Well, where does it come from? I haven't found out yet and I hope his firm never does. Look here, Ruby. You've been around and so have I and around hasn't been pretty. I've worked in night clubs since I've been 16 to keep Chick from being a corner lizard. I've wrestled my way home mornings at 5:00 just so he wouldn't turn out to be another sharp-shooter. And I'm the bad medicine that's gonna spread him all over the landscape, is that it? As far as I'm concerned, you're aces but pick on someone else. Someone who can take it. Chick can't keep you in trinkets like that. You're telling me? This costs ten Gs. All right. Have your fun and more power to you but not with all I've got. I won't stand by and see you make a sucker -out of Chick and-- -Oh, I've heard of wives pulling this act and even mothers. Now it's his sister. Next week, it'll be East Lynne. Where did you get off telling me what to do and where to go and with whom? As far as I'm concerned, the audition is over. Now, get out of here, you ham actress, and let me pack my bags. Come on. Get out. Make it snappy. You're not bad medicine, you're a poison. Oh, you think so, eh? Well, put it up to Chick and see how far you get. Hello, Jerry. Kind of early for you to be home, isn't it? None too early. Chick, it wasn't very pally of you to plan a walkout without a word to me. Oh, I left word with Mary and I figured that-- You figured you'd be gone by the time I found out. Well, I didn't want any fuss. Chick, aren't you making a mistake giving up a steady job? Uh, I'll get another one. Not with Ruby Rose around your neck. What do you know about her? Plenty. I've just seen her. Well, you had no right to go there. Chick, you're heading straight for the eight ball. Right. That's my affair. I'm not asking anything for myself. I'm older than you are, Chick, and when a girl says that you've got her down to bed rock. All right. All right. You ought to be old enough to realize that I'm over 21 too, and I don't wanna be treated like a baby brother. What about the way you're treating Mary Allen? Well, it's a break for Mary if she looks at it the right way. Oh, but she won't. You ought to know that. Why she's ready to pinch pennies and squeeze nickels with you, so you can both build something. With Mary at your elbow, you can go somewhere. I'm going somewhere right now. Listen, Chick, please. -Look out. -I won't let you. You're still wet behind the ears. -Get away from that door. -You're out of your mind passing up a sweet kid like Mary for something that ought to be shampooed out of your hair with gasoline. Jerry, I've never laid a hand against you in my life, and I don't wanna start now. I won't let you. I won't. I can't. Hold my bag here and wait. I'll be right out. -Good evening. -Good evening. Oh, Charlie, uh, did Ms. Rose's bags come down yet? Oh, yes, they were a moment ago but she phoned down and had them sent back up again. -Back up? -Yes, sir. Hi, Aggie, what are you looking so tickled about? Just got rid of a pest. Now, I've got to faceanother one. What a temper. Well, she--she's got company. Maybe she'll be more polite. Young Wheeler has just gone up. It doesn't matter who's up there, Ms. Ruby's not fussy, not at all. Police! Police! Police! Police! I didn't do it. I didn't. When I came in, she was laying there. I thought she'd fainted. And I went over and shook her a couple of times and then the maid came in. I saw it with my own eyes, he was choking her. I was trying to revive her. He was choking her, I tell you. Pipe down, Aggie. I'll get to you later. Was anybody here when you came in? No. No, there wasn't. I thought so. When was the last time you could definitely say Ms. Rose was alive? Well, before Wheeler went upstairs, she phoned down and told me to send her bags up. And his bags were in your cab? Yeah, he told me he'd be right out in a jiffy ready to go. Go? Go where? To the Union Depot. Oh, getting ready for a getaway, eh? Strangulation, collapse of the larynx and esophagus. Well, what do you know and I thought she was choked to death. Why don't you talk up kid? Get it off your chest. -It'll make you feel better. -I told you the truth. Honest, I did. I left my sister and I came right here to get Ruby. We were going away together. And she changed her mind, isn't that it? -No. -Oh, you got all steamed up and you blew your topper and then you grabbed her by the windpipe. No! An open and shut case. Well, that's all for the present. Uh, take him along. I'll talk to you later. You three can go now, but don't go far. I'll be calling on you later. Did you get the number of the cab driver? Yeah. No. Oh, yeah.I got everything. Say Burnsy, I guess, that's all we gotta do, is file our report now and knock off for the night, eh? Oh, no, not yet. We'll take a gander at the kid's apartment. Maybe his sister knows something. -More work? -Yeah, more work. Oh, good evening. The name is Burns. -Who's your friend? -Coley, known in polite society as Cobble puss Coley. Like the place? Three closets and you get one month's concession. I'm not keeping you gentlemen up am I? Sit down, Angel Face, I wanna talk to you. Oh, been hitting the catnip, eh? Any ordinance against it? What do you flatfeet want anyway? You're Jerry Wheeler, aren't you? I've known that for 27 years, so what? Chick's sister? I have a brother and I call him Chick, yes. -Oh, Chick hasn't-- -He sure has. How much did he take? Look, whatever it is, I'll make good for it. I earn good money when I work. I'll pay back a little each week. I'll work my fingers to the bone. -I'll do anything. -Now, wait a minute, Angel Face, let's get this straight. As far as I know, your brother didn't take a thing. What time did Chick leave here? I really couldn't say. I'm not a train dispatcher. Did you know he was going to Chicago with Ruby Rose? Ruby Rose? Where did you get that name off? A bottle of nail polish? Now, wait a minute, Angel Face, don't be so hard to handle. You're gonna talk to us and like it. All right. Come to the point. What's he supposed to have done? Supposed nothing. He throttled Ruby Rose to death. You didn't have to smack her right in the face with it. Keep your chin up, kid. Don't be a fool, Burns. See, they all pull that collapsible concertina act just to get out of answering questions. Take a look around the flat. I'll handle this. Burns, Chick didn't do it. He didn't. All right. I did know about Ruby Rose but he was sold on her. Don't you see, you don't kill the thing you love. Chick's no killer. I know that with all I've got. Sorry, Angel Face. Five minutes before Chick got there, Ruby was alive. A minute after he entered the apartment, the maid comes in from the outside and finds him bending over Ruby and she's dead. Did Chick say he did it? No, of course not, they never do. I told you to look around not break up the house. Now, clean that up the way you found it. Well, are you gonna help us out, Angel Face? Burns, I did it. Did what? I killed Ruby Rose. I begged Chick not to throw his life away on her. And when he walked out, I beat him up to her place and-- And? And I gave her one last chance to lay off, but she wouldn't take it. She was all soft and squashy and I took one grip and pushed hard and... Well? Nothing. She says she bumped off Ruby Rose. She must have used mirrors. Come on, let's get out of here. Oh, aren't you taking me with you? Call me up on my night off and I'll take you to the movies. By the way, uh, what was Ruby wearing when you, uh, killed her? Well, naturally she was-- she was ready to leave, she had on her hat and coat. Sure, then she took them off when she found out she was dead and wasn't going anywhere after all. We found her in pajamas. You low-down, flatfoot. You're just baiting me to get the goods on Chick. You'll frame him, I know it. Get out of here. I never wanna see you again. Hey, maybe you did do it at that. You sure sound capable of it. Have you have any idea why Ms. Rose had her bags sent back? Nope. She just said she changed her mind, that's all. How did the defendant act when you told him? Well, he seemed kind of put out. I see. Now, could anyone else have gone up to her apartment without your knowledge? No, siree. That's my job. Relax, my boy. Relax. In other words, Ms. Rose was definitely alive a few minutes before Wheeler went upstairs. I'm sure she was. What happened after that? Well, Agnes, that's Ms. Rose's maid, came in and followed Wheeler up. A couple of minutes later, she came down yelling. Police! Police! Now, Aggie, didn't Ms. Rose have other men friends besides Wheeler? Sure. They didn't mean anything. Mr. Wheeler moved up into first place. Who was some of the other men? Oh, I don't remember exactly. Uh, it kind of slipped my mind. She's stalling, she's not on the level. Don't worry, he'll make her talk. How did Ms. Rose make her living? She certainly didn't take in washing. What did she do? Well, she danced at night clubs mostly. Aggie, when you found Mr. Wheeler in the apartment that evening, -you ran out immediately. -Oh, I sure did. Then for all you know, someone else may have been hiding in the next room. Oh, I don't know anything about that. All I know is that Mr. Wheeler was choking her to death and I ran out yelling "Police! Police!" At the time you entered Ms. Rose's apartment, what was the attitude of the defendant? He was emotional, completely unnerved. Was it the defendant that notified the police of the murder? Uh, no, the maid did. I see. Then that evening, you went over to see the defendant's sister. Yeah, that's right. What was her reaction? She seemed ready to sacrifice herself for her brother. In what way? Well, she said that she killed Ruby Rose. Which you knew was a lie? Well, yes. And how did you know? Well, Ms. Wheeler said that Ruby Rose was wearing her hat and coat at the time of the murder. -Well? -We found her in pajamas. Dirty flatfoot. That'll be all. Thank you. Isn't it a fact, when Chick started for Ruby's apartment, you tried to stop him? -Why, naturally I didn't-- -And he cast you aside roughly? Oh, but he didn't mean it. He was excited. And all the years of devotion and care you lavished upon him, didn't mean anything either? The moment you crossed him, he laid hands on you? -No. -Oh, come, Ms. Wheeler, you're practically admitted that ever since you were a young girl, you were willing to lie, cheat, and starve to support him. Do we have to go into that? Get her off the stand. Get her off the stand. He's torturing her. Steady yourself. Steady, steady. You went to work at the age of 16? Yes. Describe your life from then on, the places you worked, the type of people you met, your-- Stop it! Stop torturing her! I did it. I killed Ruby Rose. Oh, you didn't. He's just saying that to spare me the humiliation of... Gentlemen of the jury, have you arrived at a verdict? We have, Your Honor. What is your verdict? We find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. No. No, he didn't do it. He... -How is she? -She'll be all right. -Call a cab. -Yes, sir. I'll help you take her home. Get away from me, you heel. You railroad him. Atta girl, feeling better already. Where did you get that lawyer? He couldn't fight a parking ticket. He's the best we could afford. We hacked everything we owned. You should've let the kid plead guilty to second degree then he wouldn't be in line-- That's a guilty man's dodge. Why should Chick admit to something he didn't do? He hasn't got a half hour's detention coming to him. He didn't lay a hand on Ruby Rose. All right, then he didn't. Well, here we are. Oh, we haven't a thing for dinner. I'll get something. Don't you come in with me, I've had enough of you. That's where you're wrong, sister. If I were a man I-- If you were, I'd never forgive you. Aren't you crowding Mary a little moving in here like this? I suppose so. But I haven't a dime left in the world. It all went to Chicks-- not that you'd care about that. Well, sell me, won't you? Just sell me that he's innocent and I'll go to town for you. Well, you didn't talk that way at the trial. Now wait a minute, Angel Face. Don't blame me for that, I was only doing my job. You heard me on the stand, did I distort the facts? Just convince me that Chick didn't do it and I'm with you up to the hilt. Well, all right. If you change your mind, you can find me at headquarters. -Before you go... -Yes? I want the address of that maid, Aggie. What for? She didn't tell all she knew. I'll bet she was greased plenty. By whom? By the one right name that belongs in this case. Look, Aggie hated her mistress. I got a load of that when I was up at Ruby's flat. But she kept on working for her just the same. Well, naturally, she needed the dough. No, because she was on someone else's payroll. -Can't you see? -No, I'm sorry, I can't. Why should you? It would only knock the daylights out of that beautiful case you sewed up. You think so? Well, all right. Here it is. But you better watch yourself it's not a pretty neighborhood. If she was paid off like you think, it'll take a lot of money to restore her memory. Will you go home, you bore me. Good luck, Angel Face. That flatfoot had an expression like the cat that just licked the cream off-- say, what's this? A big chump. He left me a hundred and fifty dollars. A hundred and fifty dollars? What for? To buy myself a pair of gumshoes, I guess. Milton Arms. Uh, who do you wish to see, sir? -Charlie Baker off duty? -Yeah. -When does he come on? -He doesn't. Why not? He just doesn't, that's all. Now, wait a minute, we're not playing 20 questions. What about Baker? What's going on? What seems to be the trouble? -Who are you? -I'm the owner of the building. I asked this man a civil question about Baker and he acts as though he's been tipped off not to talk. That will be all, Jackson. Go back to your post. All right. He was just following instructions. That killing didn't help my building any and I don't want any of my employees to become involved, you understand? Sure. Uh, but what's happened to Baker? Baker? Oh, he left on rather short notice, inherited a lot of money. Uncle died or something. -I see.-He took his kid with him back to England. By now, our friend Baker must be a duke or something. -Okay, thanks. -Well, always. Glad to help. -Hello, Jerry? -No, this is Mary. Jerry went up to see Aggie LeRoy about five minutes ago. Well, that's a pretty tough neighborhood. Uh, what's that address? Edgecomb Avenue, wasn't it? Yeah, what's the number? Ninety-two. 92 Edgecomb Avenue. All right, thanks. Aggie went out a few minutes ago. Do you know when she'll be back? She ain't far, just shopping across the street in that store. -There she is. -Go get her. Anybody see the license of that? Wait here. I saw it, I saw it. Excuse me, sir. What's that? She's dead. -Take me out of here. -Come on. That girl was murdered as sure as I'm born to shut her mouth. Can't you see? First of all, she was bribed and then as soon as the trial is safely over, she's put out of the way for good. Yeah, it begins to smell like rain. There's somebody big behind all this, somebody with plenty of influence and money. And what are you going to do about it? I don't know yet but whoever this somebody is, with Aggie dead and Baker gone, he's completely covered up his tracks. I don't care what the rest of the world thinks. You don't believe I did it, do you Mary? Of course not and neither does Jerry. That's all that matters. -I'm not afraid to die, but-- -Don't talk like that, Chick, it'll never happen. It can't. Jerry's dug up a new evidence. The way it's shaping up, you're a cinch to get a new trial, your acquittal is certain. You really think so? If I could only get out of this place. You know, every time you and Jerry come to visit me, I sort of feel as though I was born all over again. I've done a lot of thinking here, Mary. It's made me realize what an awful sap I've been. When I get in the clear, I'm gonna show you and Jerry that I'm not a total loss. Oh, Chick, we never felt you were. Just the same. I'm aching to prove it to you. When I think of all the shame, worry, and everything I've caused you both. Silly, we're so busy working, we haven't time to think of such things. Here's one the Scat Club wants high kickers for the line. Scat Club? That's one of Militis' place. Too rough, a girl has to draw a line someplace. They're paying 35 a week that's not tin. Nope. I'm thru with night clubs and I'll never work in one again as long as I live. We've got to do something or we'll be out on the street. Jerry, look at this. "Auction sale, jewelry and personal effects of the late Ruby Rose. Saturday morning. Milton Arms Apartments." That's this morning. I got a hunch we ought to be at that auction. -We may even do some shopping. -What with? I still have that a hundred and fifty Burns gave me. Milton Arms Apartments. I've only bid $30 for this beautiful solid silver musical cocktail shaker. Do I hear 35? Will somebody bid $35? Why, it's worth a hundred. Solid silver. Do I hear 35? Will somebody say 35? Drink your cocktails in swing-time, going at $30, 30 once, 30 twice, sold to the lady for $30. Will you kindly pay the bookkeeper? And now, ladies and gentlemen, the last item. What am I offered for this beautiful tool leather box? Give it to your wife or sweetheart to keep her trinkets in, or old love letters. Just to start the bidding, do I hear 50 cents? You hear five bucks. He must be a... over the house. Five dollars have been bid. Any advance on $5? He was in the car that killed the maid. $5.50. $5.50. Any advance on 5.50? $20. I hear $20. Uh, $20 has been bid, do I hear more? He's giving himself away. He wants that box awfully bad. -Twenty-one. -Twenty-one. $21 has been bid, 21. Any advance on 21? 50 bucks. 50 bucks is bid, $50. Fifty-five. -Seventy-five. -Eighty. -One hundred. -One hundred and-- One hundred and fifty. There goes the ball game. $150 has been bid. Any advance on 150? A hundred and fifty-one. She must want that mighty bad. Let her take it,we can save the dough. Okay. It's all yours, sister. Last call. Sold to the lady on my left for $151. Will you kindly pay the bookkeeper? What's it made of, platinum? Uh, name and address, please. Mary Allen, 18 2nd Avenue. Look. What's this? Shall I wrap it up? Oh, uh, no, no, never mind. Come on. There are those men. That's the same car that ran down the maid. They're trailing us. You go home. I'll take the subway. -Where are you going? -To see Burns. Smart gal. She ducked down the subway. We better follow the other one. Who's the girl that brought the box? -What's her name? -She... Come on, come on, don't stall. She's my sister, Josie Allen. Why'd she have such a yearn for that box? Yeah? She thought it was valuable because you bid it up so high. She loses her head at the auctions. Where is she now? She went out to see what she could get for it. Let's stick around until she gets here. Well, Angel Face, what are you doing here? It's about time you arrived. I've been waiting an hour. I'm sorry, lady, I've been out on a case. Never mind that,look what I've got here. What's that? I brought it with that hundred and fifty you gave me. What? Lady, I'd never marry you. It'd take a mint to underwrite you. It's Ruby Rose's. Take a look inside. Yeah? So what's inside? Look. Oh, false top? Miss Ruby Rose. Well, read it. "Dear Ruby, if you're tired of me, that's your business, but don't try to take it on the lam with those pretty bangles. They cost me a heavy sugar, and I just let you wear them. I'll be in town the day after tomorrow to pick them up. Militis." That's the Night Club King. Yeah, and owner of the Milton Arms. Then those two monkeys at the auction were just fronting for him. It's a cinch. Militis is the man, all you've got to do is make the pinch. No, no jury would convict him on this. Well, what about those two hit and run specialists that polished off the maid, and bid for this box? Aren't you gonna pick them up? Not yet. That'd tip our hand, put Militis on his guard. We've got to move easy. Well, you're a great help. In a couple of weeks, Chick gets a headstone and you sit there and tell me that-- Now hold on, hold on. What I'm telling you is for Chick's own good. Let a dumb cop work this out his own way. You've had some good hunches, and now I've got one. Listen. Hello, sis. Took you a long time to get home, sister. Say, what is this? Never mind that. I want that box. Oh, you're my competitor. The way you wentf or this, I thought it was the Hope diamond. -It's a phony, worth two bucks. -No. And I went for a hundred and fifty. Don't cry, good looking. Here's your stake back. Oh, swell. That makes me even. Say, tell a dumb dame something. Why is that box worth a hundred and fifty to you? Sentiment, sister, just sentiment. Well, I've got to hand it to Burns. Did he keep the letter? It's in the box. -What? -Oh, don't worry. He made a photo stat of it. He figured those gorillas would be around. And you called Burns a dumb cop. What happens now? I'm going to make the acquaintance of Militis. How? Didn't he advertise for line girls at the Scat Club? Come on higher, higher. We ain't in on a pass. Maybe you're knock-kneed, and that won't go, sister. I sing and dance for customers, not bathe. Okay, relax. Got any new ditties on tap? What are you wasting time for, boss? Even if she had a voice like a frog, paralyzed from the waist down, ain't you got eyes? Take a look at that face, will you? All right, you're in. 35 per. What's your name? Uh, bill me as, uh, Angel Face. Angel Face. And tell the electrician to give me an amber spot. They take the padlocks off their wallet when I come out in an amber spot. And you hang on to that face, honey, because it ain't gonna happen again -in a long, long time. -Thanks. Run over a couple of numbers with Mike for tonight. I'll see you later. Thanks. What'll it be, Angel Face? Uh, A Little Dusty, a rhumba. -How do you like it? -Oh, it's great. -Oh, you were great, honey. -Thanks. You know, there's somebody else that thinks you're pretty good too. Uh, who is it? Milton Militis. He owns the works. You got a date with a bottle of champagne at his table. Come on. Mr. Militis, this is Angel Face. She wouldn't give her right name, walked right in off the street. I waited till tonight to drop around. Sit down, Angel Face. Yes, right here. Berger, what do you pay her a week? -Well, I-- -Triple it. -Scram. -Sure. The Borelli deal. Oh, turn it off. It hurts my eyes. You flatter me, Mr. Militis. Will you make that Milt? All right, Milt. -How about a drink? -Oh, not here. The rotgut we serve here is for the cash customers, not for my friends. I've got some private stock upstairs. How about it? Well, uh, why not have it sent down here? Oh, it's too noisy here, and too many people around. We wanna talk. Do I have to draw a picture? Like it? Pretty nice having a hideout right over the club. That's the idea. Well, sit down, will you? Uh, how many shows do you do a night? Five. Oh, that's pretty tough on the arches. Look, any time you wanna relax, just come up here. The door's always open. Grab yourself some shuteye, even if I'm not here. Thanks. Yeah. Excuse me a second, Philadelphia calling. Hello, Borelli. What's the trouble now? For the love of Mike, can't you guys run the place one week without me? Yeah. Okay. Well, shoot me a wire if you need me. Never depend on anyone,Angel. You always got to do things yourself. Why the empty frame? There was a picture there, but it faded out. Bad Photography? Bad judgment. Just one of those things. Oh, sure, I know how it goes. Not always. For instance, if I had a picture of you in there, I'll bet it'd keep a long time. But I haven't got one that size. You could have one made, charge it to me. Give me time, and maybe I will. I'll count on it. I told you to keep out of here. Somebody might know your face and you'd only queer everything. Oh, I can't sit tight while you're flirting with fire. Milt's no fool. You're playing a dangerous game. But I have to take the chance. That deadline's creeping up on Chick. All right. But what do you expect to get out of Milt, a confession? He isn't that silly. No, but when I saw Ruby that night, she wore a bracelet worth a cool 10 G'S. Never showed up in the post mortem. Exactly. Now, suppose I found it in Milt's apartment. That would give you a case, wouldn't it? -That and the letter? -Maybe. Suppose while you're ransacking his place, -he pops in on you? -I'm taking care of that. He's going to get a wire tonight, telling him to hotfoot it down to Philadelphia, signed Borelli. Hey, Milt, get a load of this. I'm gonna get me a new man in Philly. Borelli's beginning to stick in my craw. We can grab a rattler out of here in 30 minutes. Yeah? Well, I'm not going. Let him squirm awhile. I'm not gonna play wet nurse to a slug-nutty bartender. The Delaney mob will move in and start housekeeping. It's the best spot in town. Yeah, I suppose you're right. Tell Pal to get the car ready. Okay. Get me Pal. I don't care where he is, get him. Evening. -Coming back tonight, boss? -No, I'm going to Philly. -Excuse me. Excuse me. -Will you throw this drunk out? He's okay, boss. He's a good spender. Oh, can't take it, eh? Okay. Well, I'm-- I'll-- what are you doing, ganging up on me? Why don't you be a good boy and sit down? Uh, I'll lead with my left and I'll give him my right. Sit down right here, pop. Pop. I'll pop you. Hey, your friend don't like me, does he? -Oh, don't be silly. -So am I. Wipe that dumb look off your pan, Angel Face, you're on your own. Well, that's funny, no answer. Maybe she's not up there. She must be. Say, maybe she's afraid. I'll try again. Hello? -Oh, Burns. -Scram out of there fast, kid. Milt's on his way back. Yeah, I had a tail on him. He phoned Philly from the station. Must have learned the wire was a phony, so get out of there fast. I can't, Burns. I haven't found a thing except the box with the letter gone. Now listen, kid, get out of there. You don't know that guy. Look, look, what, we can use the photo stats and the jewel case. I'm staying, Burns. Chick eats his last meal tomorrow. I've got to break Militis down. It's 1:00. I'm putting in a wrong number. Call at 1:30 sharp. If you're doing all right, get near that phone and cough. You get it? Cough if you're doing all right. Yeah. That's it. If I don't hear you cough, I'm breaking in up there. I hear him coming. So long. Angel Face. How do you like it, Milt? It doesn't flatter you a bit. And just tonight, someone's gonna give me a rib, send me on a fool's errand to Philly. Scram. We don't need three for pinochle? Do you know who this dame is? Dame? I like that. Don't call any of my lady friends dames. And get out and check their wire. Rocco means well, Angel, but he's just a mug. Sure, I know. Make yourself at home. You know, that dame looks very familiar. Yeah, yeah, very familiar. Come on, let's check upon that wire. Yeah, no doubt about it. That's the lady who sent the telegram all right. Much obliged. Come on, let's pick up Frankie. Honey, this stuff was old years before you were born. Goes down easy and blows the dandruff right out of your system. They're all asking for Angel Face. Forget it. She's not going on tonight. And no more phone calls. I don't wanna be disturbed. You're popular down there, Angel, but not as popular as you are with me. You wouldn't fool a fellow,would you? I'll prove it. You like pretty things, Angel? I'm not too hard to please. What is it? A little bangle I picked up, only worth about 10 G's. Oh, Milt. Put it on. Why, it's beautiful. And so different. You've got swell taste, Milt. I had it made up special. For me? When? Some time ago, in case someone like you came along. Can't you see, Angel? You're tops with me. I like your style. You're smart and classy. And a double-crossing stoolie. I thought I told you to-- Take it easy, boss. I got something to tell you -that ain't no bedtime story. -Well, tell it fast. Your little girlfriend here, Angel Face, she sent the dummy wire. The clerk at the telegraph office identified her from this picture. What's the gag? Spill it. Ask her why she wanted to get you out of town and then come up and case the layout? Oh, he's crazy. Don't believe him, Milt. Ask her why she paid a hundred and fifty bucks for that little box when she was living in a seven-buck furnished room. Ask her who she is. All right, talk up. Who are you? You're hurting me, Milt. Come on, what does he mean? Tell him, Frankie. She's Chick Wheeler's sister. I don't know what they're talking about. Frankie was in court every day of that trial. Sure. I've seen her on the stand with my own eyes. -Don't believe him, Milt. He's got it in for me, and he's trying to-- Don't let her soft-soap you, boss. Shut up. Expecting a call? Why, no, of course not. We'll see, Angel. Get that. Stay on the wire and keep talking. And don't try anything funny when that wire's open, girlie. Yeah. Trace the call on Woodlawn 6400. Well, suppose you tell me who this is, sir. That's the way it's done. Well, um, I'm, uh, I'm trying to get, uh, Samson's All-Night Delicatessen. Hello? Hello? She must be doing all right. I got the cough signal. He hung up. That was Police Headquarters. -I had it traced. -I told you, Milt. Tell Pal to get the ear ready. We're going to the farm. Right. It's a shame, Angel. You're almost too beautiful to die. All right, get it over with. No, not here. Douse her with brandy from head to foot. If she squawks when we get out, she's fighting drunk. You won't be the first drunk to be carried out of here. You know who that dame is? -No. -The patsy's sister, no less. If it hadn't been for me, she'd have had Milt in the bag. -Nice going. -Say, Pal, the boss wants you to get the car outside right away. -Right. -Why? What's the lowdown? -Hiya, fellows. -Pipe down, will you? Yeah. What's the matter? -Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. -What's your matter now? Why don't you behave? Say, do me a favor, will you? -Yeah. -Where's the telephone booth? Right over there. -How is it? -All clear. Just some stupid drunk out here. Cover her mouth like she's sick. You shouldn't mix your drink, lady, especially as you shouldn't help yourself to other people's private stock without permission. Berger, we'll take the Hobbs' ferry route. You know where I'll be if you want me. Okay. Well, you haven't got much time. They'll be giving Chick Wheeler the works in about five hours. Hello, Kane? Talk fast. Yeah, I got a flash at their car earlier in the evening. It's a black sedan. Yeah, the license number is, um, 853679. Got it? Yeah, 853679. Now they're headed for the Hobbs Ferry landing. Yeah, you may be able to cut them off there. Hurry up. Good luck. Great work, Kane. Get me radio broadcast. Calling all cars, intercept black Chrysler sedan, reported heading for Hobbs Ferry landing. License Number, 853-679. At 6:00, that's about 4 hours from now. Your brother starts on that last mile. You got a date with him when they sit him in that brass armchair. I arranged that. Why take her to the farm? Why not finish her when we go across the ferry -and drop her off? -No, no, no, no, that's too good for stoolie. My idea is to watch her sweat. So you can know what's coming to you every second, every minute for hours. Then the big blow-off. You go west just in time to welcome your brother on the other side. Hey, is that an idea or is it an idea? Pal, turn in on the radio, maybe there's some slow music on the air. Calling all cars, calling all cars. Look for a black Chrysler sedan, license number 853-679, reported heading for Hobbs Ferry landing. Pal, turn north. Head for the garage, we'll get the other car and go by way of the uptown tunnel. No sign of that car yet. Well, they'll be here any minute. Tell the boys to scatter along the landing. Just get along the landing, boys. 2:00. If we can get the goods on Militis, we've still got time to save Chick. I wonder what's happened? Kane may have got the wrong steer. Maybe. I think this is Kane now. We just raided Militis' apartment, there's enough there to hang him. Yeah, when we get him. His car hasn't smelled near here. We'll get him. He can't hide out long. -He's too well-known. -But in the meantime, what's happening to Angel Face? They're getting Chick ready to pay off for being a patsy for me. I knew you did it all along. So what? This'll stick with you as long as you live. It'll prey on your mind. You'll get the palsy thinking about it. You'll be a raving maniac. You're swell. You're slimy. Won't be long now. They're getting Chick ready for the old marble orchard. Cut out the gab. What are we waiting for? Let's get started and blow. Pipe down and relax. You're more scared-- quit waving that gun. Your hand shaking so, you'll have a blow out your own brains. Besides, I don't want any gunplay. It's too loud. It might wake the neighbors. I'm gonna handle this my own way. You double crossed me like Ruby did and I'm gonna take care of you like I took care of Ruby. I snuffed her out just like that. That's all I wanted to know. Come on, lift them up and don't try anything. All right, boys, take them along with you. Get moving. You all right, Angel Face? -Chick, is he-- -I've taken care of that. With what we've got on Milt, Chick will be out in 24 hours. But how did you find this place? Well, an old buddy of yours tipped us off, after, uh, a little persuasion. Take it easy there, gorgeous. Take it easy. If I'd have raided your club a little sooner, I'd have gotten some sleep by now. Just wait till my mouthpiece hears about this, you'll be back pounding the pavement. Talking about pounding, get in there. Come on, you funny-looking ape, get in there. I don't know how I'll ever thank you. You won't have to, Angel Face. Gosh you smell like a brewery. A brewery? You hear? Oh, Burnsy, I'll see you later.
