(ominous music) (projector rattling) (pensive music) - I mean, $4 for a soda? - I don't make the prices, sir. - You and I both know that the water and syrup only costs 25 cents. - Well, the movie you're about to see cost several million dollars to make, and you're seeing it for 10 bucks, so guess it evens out. - Come on, let's just go. - Enjoy the show. (ominous music) (reel squeaking) (coin slot clanks) (trash can rumbling) (garbage crinkles) - You know... Why do we even give people their ticket stubs? Be easier if we just threw them on the ground ourselves. - Yeah, but if they didn't throw 'em on the floor you wouldn't have a job. - Sure I would. I'd be the one throwing them on the ground. - Where's Sheila? - Theater One. - Have you stocked yet? - No, I just had a customer a few minutes ago. - Hey, Fuller? Why do we even give customers their ticket stubs? No one checks them and they wind up on the ground anyways. It'd be easier if we just dumped them on the floor ourselves. - There you go, Kyle. Now there's the question that everyone who's ever worked here has asked me. (suspenseful music) - [Girl] This is so stupid. - I knew this was coming. I just wasted all of my money. - Yeah, it was your choice. - Well, it's not my fault. I thought it was gonna be good. - [Girl] Well, it's not, so... (girls chattering) (woman in film screams) - [Woman in Film] Leave me alone! Go away! Please, stop! - Hey, Alan. Where are we at with Theater Three? - It's on its last reel, man. - Why do you still call it a reel? - 'Cause I'm old school. Digital sucks. - How's the bulb? - It's about at max. - All right, when it's done, go ahead and change it out. It was a little dim during the 7 o'clock. - All right. - I'm sorry, sir, we're closed. - It's not that. Can I talk to your manager? - Yes sir, how can I help you? - Look, I know you're busy, and I don't want to waste your time. You got better things to do. - Aw, it's no problem, sir. What's going on? - Well, there's some kids up front. The movie's almost over. They won't shut the hell up. - In Theater Three? - Yeah, up front. Waving their hands, acting all crazy. But look, can you do something for me and talk to them? 'Cause if I do, it's not gonna be cordial. (ominous music) - Sir, we'll take care of it. Please go enjoy your movie. Kyle, please do a head count in Theater Three. - [Man in Film] How many other fucking customers in this place do that? And in the fucking bathroom, ain't no fucking toilet paper. How 'bout that soap? That sand-ass soap that kids have in high school. I hate that shit! Men's restroom ain't got no fucking toilet paper, but the women's, they got some in there. I know that for a fact. (Laughs) I'm in a bar here! I expect to have a glass mug, cold glass mug! You serve beer in plastic cups and paper cups. Who the hell does that shit? I deserve that for being a regular! (audience members clap) I want some fucking service! (Laughs) - Good. (man laughing) - [Man in Film] Why don't you tell me? Does Charlie really have a little dick? (Laughs) - [Man in Film] You can't fucking hide from me! (woman in film squeals) - Can't you people watch a damn movie without trashing the joint? It's bad enough you lowlifes run your mouth during this film, but this... (Sheila sighs) - Sheila, when you're finished in here, can you take care of Theater Three? It's about to drop. - Come on, Fuller. - Sorry. Tammy still hasn't stocked yet. - Well, how convenient. What about Kyle? - Nah, he's got the posters. Look, the sooner it's clean, the sooner we can watch that new movie together. - I've still gotta do Theater Two. - Nah, it's done. Kyle took care of it. - You know, Fuller, I swear these people were raised in a barn. How many people? - Alan said about eight. - Okay. - Look, tomorrow night you can have box office. I promise. - Thank you. Oh, god. What is this? Oh god. So gross. (ominous music) - Ah! (Kyle sighs) (Alan laughs) - Oops! - Yeah, that's what your mom said when she had you. You should leave it on. It's an improvement. - You know, Kyle, you could use this for more than just holding popcorn. - What are you talking about? - I'm just saying, if you make a certain modification, say, right here... Provides pretty good cover for when you're fooling around with a girl in a dark theater. - A real woman wouldn't need it. - Damn, man! Have to start dating some of your exes. Yo, what the hell is the deal with Theater Three, man? - Everybody always shuts up the moment you walk in. - Yeah, well, I don't blame that guy for complaining. Hate that shit, when somebody runs their mouth during a movie. Kill for less. - Oh, did you get that new movie prepped? - Yeah. Camcorder's ready too. I'ma bootleg this like a son of a bitch. - Well, you better not let Fuller catch on what you're doing. - Shit. Fuller doesn't give a shit, man. Besides, I make more selling the bootlegs than I do working here. - Is it any good? - Meh. Couple good-looking bimbos in it. Stoners'll like it. Hey, did, uh, you see that hot chick during the 7 o'clock? - You mean with the red skirt and the boots? - Oh my god, yes. - She applied for a job here. - Shut up, are you serious? - Yours truly gave her the application. - That's great. I gotta go. (phone rings) - Hello? (ominous music) - Here it is. - Lori. Yeah, that's a pretty hot name, huh? - Mmm. - What do you think her porn name would be? - Well, she brought her pretty hot boyfriend with her today. - What do you think his porn name would be? Dude, I'm not surprised, man. She was way too good-looking to be single. - Oh, I got her profile. Check it out. - Oh, man! Yeah, she's pretty hot. - Hmm. - Oh, shit. It says here she works at Dairy Queen right now. - I suddenly have the urge for a banana split. - Well, perhaps we should go to Dairy Queen before work tomorrow, huh? - Dude, we gotta get her a job here. - Oh, I'll give her a job. (both chuckle) Let's go talk to Fuller. - Yeah. - Can my friend Amy come check out the movie? She works with me at the clinic. Please? Please? Please? Please? She's cool and she really wants to see it. She really loves horror movies. Plus she's cute. - Okay, but you do the theaters tomorrow. - Deal. - All of them. - Fine. - I mean it. I don't want to hear any complaining about it tomorrow. - I promise. - [Alan] Hey, Fuller! Fuller! - Okay. Tell her to hurry up. - I'll call her right now. - [Alan] Hey, Fuller! Fuller! (Sheila sighs) Hey, Fuller. Fuller! Yo, Fuller, check this out, man. You have got to hire this chick. - Dude, she is smokin' hot. - Please! Please, man. - She only wants part-time. - Yo, but her body? Her body was full-time. Could be Fuller-time. - [Fuller] Is this her? - [Kyle] Yup. - She's, uh... (Fuller sighs) She's hired. (Alan and Kyle laugh) - Aw! (Groans) - Walk it off, buddy. (dog yips) (phone dialing) (ominous music) - Amy. Hey, yeah, it's cool. Well, how soon can you get here? - Uh, I don't know. We're screening it tomorrow night for one night only, but we have to check it first for glitches, you know? No, we got that stuff here. Just get here, okay? Okay, bye. (Sheila sighs) (Sheila sputters) - (scoffs) God, I hate these. (Fuller clears throat) - Oh. Hey, Fuller. Projector's ready to go, man. - Ready to go? Okay, and what about the, uh... - Got it right here. Careful, man. The ink's still drying. - You know, if you get caught doing this, you're on your own. I don't know a thing about it. - Get caught? Fuller, I've already been caught, man. - What do you mean? When? - About a month ago. - Uh, what happened? - I was out driving with some buddies of mine and a cop pulled us over and saw a box of bootlegs in the back. - And? - And he bought three. - You're kidding. - Nah, he says he works so much he didn't have time to go to the theaters that often, so... I'm serious. - Great story, but I need you to hold off on this for a minute. Tammy's friend is on the way to join us. - Male or female? - Female, and Tammy says she's really hot. - Nice. Do I have time to order in? - If you hurry, maybe. Ask them how long it's gonna take. - Yeah, so can I get like five cheeseburgers? Mm-hmm. Yeah, like, one of 'em with no onions. Yeah, one of 'em. No, seriously, I'm allergic. - How long? - Yeah, so how long's the wait? Okay. I'm on hold. - People have nothing better to do then trash this theater. Sorry bunch of lowlifes. That's good enough. - You're sure they deliver this late? - Yeah. It's a hefty delivery fee, man. - Dude, where's your cell? - I forgot it in the booth. - He's too lazy to go get it. - Hey, stop hating, fellas. Remember, I'm buying here. Oh, shut up. Yeah, no. How long? Right around the corner at the Montwood Theater. (foreboding music) - Shit! (Sheila whimpers) - Mm-hmm. 20-25 minutes? All right, thank you. No problem. Thank you. Food's on its way. - How much? - About 24 bucks. Hey, no, no, no, no. I said I got it, man. - I said I got- - Hey, Fuller. Uh, Fuller- - You're already finished? - No, no, no, there's a guy in there. - In Theater Three? - Mm-hmm. - [Fuller] What's he doing? - He's sleeping in one of the seats. - [Fuller] Hang on, I'll deal with this. - [Alan] Yeah. - [Fuller] Sir? Sir. Sir. - What? - [Fuller] Sir, the movie's over, so I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to ask you to leave. - The movie isn't... The movie's still going, it's not over. (bottle smashes) Goddammit. - Jesus. How the hell did he get that in here, Kyle? - Who's gonna search him, Alan? - I hope he didn't apply here. - Hey. You know what? - Sir? - Yesterday I was out back, and you know what I found? I found an owl. - I'm sorry? - [Drunk] I found this here owl. - An owl? You mean an owl? - I got an owl, man. I finally got my owl! (eerie music) - That's really great, sir, but we do need to close now and I gotta ask you to leave. - You're gonna have to ask me to go? Your movie theater. Not my home. (Sheila exhales) - "Come on, Sheila, there's only eight people in Theater Three." "Got this here owl." Whatever, fuck. (drunk burps) - Aw, that guy smelled like shit, man. - How did he afford admission? - Yo, Kyle, what the hell were you doing selling that guy a ticket? - Hey, he had the money. Well, what was I supposed to do? Tell him no? - You shouldn't have sold that guy a ticket. - I'm surprised that angry customer wasn't complaining about him instead. - All right, Kyle. Go Lysol that seat immediately, please. - [Kyle] Sure. - Spray a lot! - Oh, and Kyle? Next time, tell him we're sold out. Jesus. Yo, but he did smell like shit though. You gotta fire that guy. (ominous music) Hey, so Tammy, what's the deal with this friend of yours? She, uh... She hot? - Pretty much. - Is she, like, actually hot, or is she just one of these average-looking chicks who thinks she's hot? Hate that shit, man. All right, how old is she then? - 22. She works with me in my other job. - Least she's drinking age, huh? She got a boyfriend? - What's it to you? - Making conversation. Jeez, Tammy. We don't talk enough, you know? Does she? - Nothing serious. - What's she look like? - Find out when she gets here. - Maybe I'll take her out back and, uh, show her this here owl, huh? - Think you mean hummingbird. (Alan screeches) - I'ma grab some popcorn. (aerosol can hissing) - Hell yeah. Spray the hell outta that chair. - Wonder if this guy had lice. - He probably hasn't showered in about a year. (Kyle sniffs) - Aw, man! That's rank! - Hey! At least you only had to talk to him through the glass. I had to take his ticket from him face-to-face. - I couldn't deny him admission. I'd be on the news by now. - Did he pay with a bunch of pennies? - No, a $20 bill. - Well, where do you think he got that? - Who knows? Maybe someone gave it to him. Maybe he ripped someone off. (Kyle sniffs and groans) (can hissing) - Oh, hey, Tammy. Oh, remember that hot chick in the 7 o'clock? The one with the red dress? - The blond one? Yeah, I remember. - Fuller's gonna hire her. - No he's not. - Oh yes, he is. - Why, 'cause she's pretty? - Pretty? Oh, she's not pretty, Tammy. She is the definition of hot. - It was a business decision, okay? Pretty girls are great for business and they bring in a lot of customers. - Good save. - Can we find out if brawny studs are good for business too? - I just want to go home. - You don't want to stay and watch the movie? - I'm not in the mood. Darren and I had a fight. Plus, it's that time of the month. - Oh, thanks for sharing that. Come on. It's gonna be fun. There's food on the way. - Maybe I should call Darren. - Hey, he can call you, right? - I mean, yeah, I guess. But he hasn't called or texted all day. - See? - Screw it. You're right. - Tammy's staying. - I don't blame her. I hate watching movies with the public. - Mmm. - Where's your friend? - She should be here any minute. - Mmm. I want to get this show on the road. Gotta work swing shift tomorrow. - I just called her a couple minutes ago. She should be here soon. - Welp. I'll be in the office for a bit. - Okay. - Come get me when she's here. I'll let her in. - Okay. (ominous music) (owl hoots) - Can I help you? - Come on, get here. (phone chirps) "Sorry, can't make it." Well, why the hell not? - And he is such a cheapskate, you know? Like, his parents are rich, and he's like that. He doesn't even have to work. - Is he an only child? - Yeah! - Figures. - Miserable skinflint. - Rich people are so stingy because they want to keep being rich. They don't like to spend any of their own money because they have this fear of someday being poor. - Well, still. He shouldn't be like that. - Screw him. Nobody likes a Grinch. Tightwads like him never change. - You think so? - Mm-hmm. - Maybe you're right. - I know I am. (car approaches) (line ringing) (foreboding music) - Hey, Fuller. You good, man? Hey, those Russian prostitutes you ordered are here. - That was fast. - Ah, just kidding. Burgers are here, man. - All right. So Tammy, where's your friend? - [Tammy] Oh, she couldn't make it. - That sucks. Fuller said she was hot. - She is. You're missing out. - So what's this movie? - It's a classic horror piece that's never been released on home media, ever. - [Alan] Eh, it's not on 35, so... - So? - So? So it's just a digital file. - Alan's a film snob. - Hey, movies look better on film, man. I mean, film projection used to be a fucking art form. - Sure, until you had missed splices, missing reels, and film burns. - What's a film burn? - Projectors' bulbs used to get so hot that the film can only pass in front of it for like a split second, so if the projector jammed, then the film would stop and melt. - Really? - Yep. Happened to every projectionist. - Hey, Fuller. Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? - So Tammy, how about your friend? - Well, she's not answering her cell. - Her name's not Lori, is it? - [Tammy] Oh, no. Who's Lori? - Yeah, so Fuller. Hey, man. Do you mind if I ask you a favor? - I might. - All right, so check this out. Me and a buddy were at the flea market on Sunday and I bought this reel, and it's really old and it's kinda beat up. And it was only like five bucks, and I was just, like, thinking- - Mm-hmm? - Maybe we can... - Let me guess. You want to pull out the 35 millimeter projector and take a look at it. - I mean, yeah. I got no other way to view it, man. - What's on it? - I don't know. - Don't give me that. I know you've held it up to the light at least once. - Look, I don't know 'cause it's in Scope, so... Come on, Fuller, it's just one reel. Not even a full reel, maybe like five minutes long. Dude, come on. It's not gonna hurt the projector. And, like... Man, what if it's like a snuff film or something? - A snuff film? In CinemaScope? - Yeah, I remember her. Don't know why you're making such a big deal. She's not all that. I mean, you guys don't have a chance, but... - You're gonna owe me for this. - Yeah. Yeah, big-time. - Damn right, big-time. And I don't want anybody in here knowing about it. Not even Kyle. - Deal. - I'm serious, because if they find out, they're all gonna bring their home movies in here and I don't have time for that. - Look, I won't say a word, man. - All right. Tomorrow night, and I'm going in there with you. - Yeah. - It's got a sound stripe? - Yeah, man. - Social media photos can be very deceiving. - Alan and I saw her with our own eyes. The pics are legit. - Whatever. - [Fuller] Everyone finished? - "Thank you, Alan!" - Hey, I pitched in. - Yeah, gee, Alan. Fine dining. - Thanks, Alan. - [Fuller] All right, let's get this show on the road. Tammy, while Alan gets the movie ready, take care of this mess. - Sure. - [Kyle] I really think you're gonna love this movie. - [Sheila] Oh, you think so? - I more than think, I know so. - Do you think it's gonna keep me awake? - Oh, yeah. Yo, you're gonna be screaming your head off. - No way! I don't believe you. But hey, I am glad I stayed. - Cool. - And I do love horror movies. - Yeah, don't think about whatshisname. - I won't. (Kyle and Sheila laugh) - Aw, dammit! - What's the matter? No butter? - I forgot my drink. - Will you bring me a box of Milk Duds, please? - Yeah. - Thank you! - You want some popcorn? - I'm good, thanks. - Are you coming? - Yeah, I'll be right there. - All right, well, you better hurry. The movie's about to start. - Okay, Kyle. (ominous music) (phone ringing) - Roller King, this is Rachael. - [Caller] Satan! - [Rachael] Fuck off! - He's the killer, you... Stupid. (door slams) - Wendy the ho. - Alicia the slut. (eerie music) - [Kyle] Aw, what the hell? - [Sheila] What happened? - [Fuller] Alan, it's the bulb. - [Alan] Shit. - You didn't change it out, did you? - I thought I'd make it through another screening. - [Kyle] You know we're gonna have to start the movie over again, right? - [Sheila] Why? - So Alan can continue his illegal recording. - [Alan] Shut up, asshole. - [Fuller] No, no, we'll just pick it up from where we left off. Intermission, everyone. - Fuck. - [Sheila] How long? - As long as it takes. - [Fuller] And that's why we do these test screenings. - (sighs) Goddammit. Couldn't this have happened two hours later? I miss the days of film, man. - So what do you think of it so far? - Well, the "please silence your phone" ad was very powerful. - Where's Tammy? - I don't know. She said she was coming in. She was right behind me. - Look at this, Kyle. It's 12:30 and the jerk doesn't care where I am. (Kyle sighs) And my phone is about to die. - Fuck him. So Fuller, when are you gonna hire Lori? - I don't know. Um, sometime next week. Sheila, go check the ladies' room. See if she's in there. Kyle, check the other theaters. (ominous music) - Tammy! Hope you didn't leave a mess. (door creaks) (Kyle sighs) - Meh. (Fuller exhales) (film characters cheer) - [Man in Film] Good stuff, good stuff. - Did you find her? - No. - Well, she didn't leave. All the doors are still locked. - Well, maybe she's in the can. - Bulb's replaced, man. Picture's back up. - All right, we gotta check the print and make sure it's not damaged, so let's get this show on the road, yeah? (ominous music) - Did you find Tammy? - Nuh-uh. So what'd I miss? - That guy's about to get slashed. (metal clanks) - Oh, man! He didn't even get to finish his friggin' joint. - I already know who the killer is. Want me to tell you? - No! - No! - Fine. - [Girl 1] Makes the back of my head tingle. - [Girl 2] Tastes better than real cigarettes. (soda hissing) - Aw, shit! (groans) God, I hate it when this happens. (Kyle grunts) "No, Kyle, we don't want to know who the murderer is. We want to figure it out for ourselves." All these horror movies are the same. Some group of idiots don't even know what's going on right underneath their nose. (ominous music) - [Girl 1] I was obviously talking about the kid that died. - [Girl 2] What happened? - [Girl 3] Yeah, a kid died here back in the '80s. - [Girl 4] What happened? - [Girl 3] Well, he was epileptic and he had a seizure because of the strobe light. - [Kyle] What'd I miss? - She took her shirt off. - How was it? - I mean, I've seen better. - [Man 1] Parents didn't know about strobe lights and seizures? - Hey, Fuller. Fuller. Fuller! Hey, man, can you, uh... Can you go open the door for me, man? - For what? - 'Cause I need to smoke. - Uh, why don't you go fire one off in the bathroom like you don't think I know you're doing every day? - Jeez. - [Girl] Whatever happened to the babysitter? - Go up to the booth and check the audio levels. (Alan sighs) - Goddamn piece of shit. Oh, god, I hate digital. Except for you, my little Japanese friend. - [Girl 1] Did you see what that bitch wrote about me in the bathroom? - [Girl 2] Where is she? - I'll be right back. - [Kyle] Okay. (sinister music) - [Girl 1] Oh, you're so dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! - Bootleg this son of a bitch. Goddamn! Fucking Fuller! Jesus Christ, man. Scared the shit outta me. - Put those damn cigarettes away. You know this is a no-fire zone. - It's gone, it's out, it's away. - Great. You know, I can let the piracy slide, but I can't have you burning down the joint, you know? - I'm not gonna burn down the place, Fuller. - I don't want to see those again. Get them outta here. (door clangs) - Shit! God! (door clanging) (suspenseful music) Kyle! That bum is outside. - So? - So? He's banging on the door. Come on. - Oh, shit. - [Girl] My money says she's a freak. - Just think about how much of your paycheck goes out to the cigarettes every week. - Fuller! Fuller? - What? - There's a guy outside. - What guy? - I don't know, maybe the guy that was sleeping in the theater. - The bum? - Mm-hmm, yes. - Oh, god. Could you smell him? - Listen, I was by the phone, I was making a call, and the next thing you know, somebody's trying to pound on the door. - Do you want me to call the police? - No, don't do that. Is he still there? - Can you please get rid of him? - Let's go take a look. (Alan sniffs) - Dammit! You guys, he was right there, I swear. - It's okay, I believe you. - Did you see him? - Nope. - Fuller, can I deny that guy admission next time he comes here? - Uh, no. - Well, we should at least go out there and take a look, man. - Bad idea. You just want to smoke. - I mean, we should at least make sure he's not hanging around. - Relax, the door's locked. He's not getting back in. - Wait. So if the doors are locked, then where's Tammy? - Maybe she went out the back door. (suspenseful music) - See? (Fuller pounds doors) Locked. I locked all the doors. - Well, then she has to be here somewhere. - All right, go and see if you can find her. I'm gonna run to the office and call her cell. (Fuller sighs) We're gonna be here all night. - Goddammit. This whole thing's fucked now. (Alan exhales) - You think she's in the stockroom? - I don't know, why don't you two ladies go check? Oh, I left my laptop running. (ominous music) - [Sheila] Aren't you supposed to mop in here? - [Kyle] Yeah, we're supposed to. - [Sheila] Are we gonna finish the film? - Who knows at this point? - Where do you think Tammy is? - Probably at home in bed. (keys jingle) Keys to the kingdom. (Sheila giggles) So you called whatshisname on the payphone? - [Sheila] Hmm? Oh. Yeah. - [Kyle] You didn't want him to know it was you calling. You talk to him? - [Sheila] No, I hung up. - [Kyle] Ah. - [Sheila] And then I heard the banging on the door. - [Kyle] So he answered? - [Sheila] Yeah. Yeah, it sounded like he was in a car with a bunch of people. - Sounded like he was having fun. - Um, I... - Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that! Shit! He probably was having a good time. - Come on! Come on, bring the camera down six more inches, man. Get her tits in the shot. What kinda pussy director doesn't show any skin? It's a fucking horror film, isn't it? Show some skin. Lame-ass fucking directors nowadays. (tense music) What the fuck? - Hmm. Ms. Lori Jae. See you very soon. (ominous music) - I shouldn't have called him. I mean, he knows it was me. - So what? - Well, I tried to... I just don't know why I care so much. Like, I feel stupid. - Hey, he's stupid if he's cheating on you. - Thanks. - Besides, he ain't got no owl. (Sheila laughs) - Oh my god, that guy smelled so bad. - Would you go out with him? - No! - It's a valid question. - It is not valid. - [Kyle] Bums need lovin' too. (ominous music) - [Sheila] Do it. - Ta-da! - Oh, you made it. - Of course. (sinister music) Alan? - Wow. Is that a dog? - [Kyle] Oh, shit. Fuller's gonna have Alan's head for this. - I am not cleaning this up. - Where did he go? - Smoking, probably. (ominous music) - [Fuller] Kyle, Sheila. Where's Alan? - Probably smoking. - And hey, um, he made a major mess up in the booth. There's popcorn all over the place. - And I'm not cleaning it up. - Me neither. - Did you find Tammy? - No. - Alan and Tammy are probably getting it on. - Dammit. I still gotta finish checking the movie. - Can't we just go without screening it? - No, we can't. I can't. - We have to see if there are any flaws. It's part of our contract with the studios. - That's right. Kyle, go look for Alan. Check the bathrooms, the closets, and the back door. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Sheila, go find Tammy. Search anywhere you haven't searched already. - Okay. - I'll be in the back parking lot looking for her car. - [Kyle] I thought you said all the doors were locked. - They are, I'm just gonna crack 'em open and take a look to be sure. All right, let's go. Pronto. (Kyle chuckles) - Eight bucks for a tub of popcorn. Man, we really rip people off. (suspenseful music) - Tammy? Tammy? Tammy! (bum moans) - Huh! Private Jones had one of these in... - You find Tammy? - Nuh-uh. What are you doing? - Just looking. Got the munchies. - Did you finish your burger? - Long ago. Besides, Tammy would've thrown away what was left anyway. - Hey, so what do you think about Chelsea from box office? - How do you mean? - I mean, would you... - Would I tap that? - I mean do you think she's pretty. - Yeah. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - So you would do it with her? - Mm-hmm. - So why have you not asked her out? - 'Cause I don't wanna. - But you just said you'd bang her. - Doesn't mean I want her to be my girlfriend. (ominous music) Some of the people that work with movies, they gotta be like crazy to do all that stuff. - [Sheila] Well, they are crackheads, right? - [Kyle] I guess so. They must be. - [Sheila] What I've heard. You're it! (Sheila laughs) - [Kyle] Oh, it's on. (Laughs) (suspenseful music) (Kyle laughs) - Just give up. You won't catch me. - You know, I never knew how facetious you could be. - So, you do give up. - Mmm... Nuh-uh. (Kyle grunts) (both laughing) (suspenseful music) - Time out, time out, time out, time out! - "Time out." - No, seriously. I gotta go to the bathroom. - That's convenient. - Oh, come on. I really gotta go. I drank a lotta water. - (chuckles) You think I was born yesterday? - Okay, trust me. I swear we will pick this right back up right here, when I'm finished. Plus, I'm on my period. - You said that before. - Thank you, Kyle. Are you gonna wait for me? - You want me to? - Yes. This is to be continued. (Sheila chuckles) Kyle. Kyle, Kyle. Kyle. ♪ Fare thee well, River John ♪ ♪ Every child's movin' on ♪ ♪ Every soul you ♪ - Huh? - Dude, what are you doing? - Uh, just, uh, waiting for Sheila. - Mmm. Where are Tammy and Alan? - Oh, they're long gone, Fuller. - We don't know that. - Yes we do. If Tammy and Alan were having sex, Alan would've finished a long, long time ago. - Okay, even if that were true, their cars are still in the parking lot, so they couldn't have gone far. Go upstairs, check the projection booth again. - Alrighty. - And Kyle, if I ever catch you singing like that again, you're so fired. (ominous music) (Fuller sighs) These damn kids. (line ringing) (phone ringing) - [Kyle] Hello? - Alan? Where the hell are you? - [Kyle] This is Kyle. I found Alan's phone in the booth. - Goddammit. Well, keep looking. - Yeah, well, I just found him. (ominous music) Yo, Alan. Fuller is seriously pissed at you. Man, where you been? We turned this place upside down. Wait a minute. You were doing the deed with Tammy, huh? (Kyle laughs) Oh. Want your phone? Fine, I'll just leave it right here. Fuller wants that movie screened ASAP. He's getting seriously pissed about it. - Kyle? Yoo-hoo! You gonna try to sneak up on me? (line ringing) - Come on, Tammy. Pick up the damn phone. - Okay, Kyle, don't think I won't come in there. I'm giving you fair warning. Here I come. - So? - I told him to start it up. - What was he doing when you found him? - Messing around with that popcorn tub on his head. - All right, that's it. I'm cutting his hours next week. If he wants to mess with me, I'm gonna mess with his wallet. - Well, why don't you just accidentally misplace his paycheck for a few days? It's not like he'd care or anything. He makes more money off torrents than he does actual work. (suspenseful music) - Okay. So you're not in here. I feel stupid. Kyle, Kyle, Kyle. - Goddammit. What a fucking mess. The hell's going on up here? Son of a bitch. Hey. (suspenseful music) - Gotcha! (ominous music) (Sheila laughing) - That whole popcorn-tub-on-the-head thing is a bit overplayed, don't you think? That better be used, 'cause those are 40 bucks a case. Where the hell have you been, huh? (sinister music) You know, you are this close to getting fired. This close. I know you don't want that. Your little gig here pirating videos? It'll all be over. You'll be stuck flipping burgers at a diner all day. - Come on, Kyle. Maybe I'll let you catch me. Catch me, you can have me. Are you really that clueless? (ominous music) Kyle? (sinister music) Shit! (tense music) (Sheila whimpers) (Sheila sobs) Alan, stop it! (Sheila panting) Who are you? - Who am I? I'm the guy that pays to see the movie. I'm the guy that has to put up with those inconsiderate pricks on their cell phones when they can't take their conversations elsewhere. And your theater crew, you guys are doing nothing about it. So I'm doing something about it. - But why us? Why Kyle? He just works in the box office. - He sells the tickets to those assholes. - [Sheila] (sobbing) I, um... Um, I don't know why... Why not the customers? - They'll get theirs soon enough. And that one bum? The guy, the one you kicked out, remember? Nothing's gonna happen to him because he didn't piss me off. - But we had nothing to do with it. - You have everything to do with it. I don't sneak food into the theater. I pay for your high-priced concessions. All I want is some peace and quiet. I come to the theater wanting to have a good time. I've been waiting for this movie to come out. I waited, I don't want to do opening weekend because of all the problems I would have with people. I came on a weeknight. Month after it's out, weeknight. Can you... I can't believe this. To the last screening and there's only eight people in the theater. Eight! But there's always an asshole in the bunch. - Okay, I mean, I'm sorry, okay? Um, I'm really... I'm really sorry. But, um... Um... - Well, say it. I'm waiting. Say it! - I mean, I mean, I guess if it's so bad, why... Why... Why don't you just wait for it to come out on DVD? (ominous music) - Fucking bitch. I don't want to see it on DVD. I want to see it in the theater like it was intended! Hey! Hey! You forgot to check my ticket! And your popcorn sucks. (tense music) (neck snaps) Your silence is appreciated. (pensive music) Oh, excuse me, guys. Sorry, watch your feet. I got big feet, sorry. (Grunts) Sorry about that. Ooh. Excuse me. Pardon. Mmm, shoot, sorry. (cinephile groans) I hope y'all are gonna enjoy this as much as I do. (sighs) Finally. (brooding music)
