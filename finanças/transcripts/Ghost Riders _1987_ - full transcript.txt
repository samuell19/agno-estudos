Brethren, there is evil amongst us! - Amen! - The devil himself - is within them walls. - Amen! Are we gonna risk letting him loose again upon this town? No! That Frank Clements is a killer! - A murderer of children! - Amen! For retribution is at hand! The Lord says, "Drive the beast from your midst! Destroy him! Send him back to the hell that spawned him". Hey everybody, get him out! So, you finally have your way with me, Preacher Man. It's not my way, Frank Clements, but the way of the Lord what counts here. You've been tried fair and square. And sentenced to hang for the wrongful killing of Jake Barley and his two sons. And hang you will. - String him out! - Hang 'em! Get him over here. Get him up here. Get him up here. Take him up, take him up. Thaddeus Sutton, what the hell you think you're doing? Don't try to stop us now, Ed. There's the Lord's work to be done here and we aim to do it before his boys have the chance to bust him loose. I know how you feel. We all knew Jake and his family. They're good folks, they were. But the law's the law. And the law says I hang Frank Clements in the morning, sunrise. The laws of men do not exceed the law of God. Clements is a minion of Lucifer. And if we see to is hanging for crimes against man and God, neither can find fault with this part. Sorry, Sheriff, I tried but there was too many of them. Is that part of the Lord's work, Thadeous? I'm right sorry for that, Slim, but the rain falls on the just and the unjust alike. Come on, Sheriff. Let him hang me and get it over with. I ain't afraid of dying and I can't stand no more of this preaching. That book gives him the right to do anything he wants to in the name of the Lord. You see, you see how it is with his kind? No respect for the laws of men or the word of God! This is the tool of Satan. The very one that Clements used to blow the head clean off Jake Barley. I swear on the name of God and on Jake's grave, it'll never again be used for evil in the hands of Frank Clements or any other man. It shall serve as a reminder to future generations of the wicked soul we dispatched to hell this very night. - Yeah! - Hang him! - Hang him! - Hang him! No offense to the Lord, Preacher, but I wouldn't be much of a law man if I let this continue. Now you just bring Frank Clements down off there and we'll have a good and proper hanging in the morning. Now I want all y'all to go home. Get down! It's the Clements Gang! Damn you to the bottomless perdition, Frank Clements. May your soul never rest. As you sow, Preacher, so shall ye reap. Ah, here it is. Well, it says here he was dead about five days when they found him. That could mean September 17th. September 17th hasn't been a particularly good day for the Suttons, has it? Or for this guy. Now you don't suppose he could have anything to do with this, do you? Yeah, you're right. We can't be too careful. Supreme Allied Command. This is Jim Sutton. Damn it. You're dime, bud. Start anytime. I need to talk to Hampton. Hampton? Yes. He's ringing out the pits right now. Tell him his dad called. Let me get something to write with. I'm not gonna remember this. Just tell him to call me. It's very important. Okay, shoot. Hello? You're the honkiness son of a bitch I ever saw. Hell, Professor, we got fish to catch. From what I hear, the only fish you catch comes wrapped in plastic. Ah, no, we got a new system. Don't we, Baxter? We sure do. I got me a new spoon. Can't miss. Well are you going down to Neil's Creek or over to Bosky River? Bosky River. That's where we left our boat last time. Mm-hmm, well I suppose you'll be wanting to stay out there all night. All night. Well, please clean up after yourselves this time. Okay? Okay, professor. Come on, Baxter. Thanks, Professor. We belong together. Have you seen Hampton this morning? Hey, is anybody alive in there? - Quit screwing around. - Hey, I'm looking for Hampton. Have you seen him? He's out at the pits. I won't do anything drastic. I won't kill him more than twice, I swear it! Come on, Hampton. What's the problem, dude? Bring her in. What the hell's wrong with you? I told you I still had work to do on that intake manifold. Well, the manifold's fine, Corey. You just worry too much, huh? Besides, I just felt the need. Well in case you forgotten, we have an air show in Brownsville on Saturday. - Yeah. - That's four days away. - In case you need... - Plenty of time for last minute tinkering. - Don't you think? - Wrong. We're going to your dad's place tomorrow and that'll take all day. What? That's three left, huh? No sweat. Look, partner. You may fly the Screaming Meanie, but I keep her guts together. I mean, either I call the shots on that engine or I don't. Hey, you're the best kid. Huh? - I always said that, didn't I? - Oh, look. I just don't like the idea of you getting stuck up there with your ass in the wind, you know? I appreciate it. So you ready for tomorrow? About tomorrow. I was thinking about taking this friend along to meet the professor, - If you don't mind. - What's her name? Well this one's different. She's really bright. Her name's Pam and she's working on her masters in history up at the university. And when I just happened to mention that I was going to visit the renowned professor, Sutton, you should have seen her eyes light up. She's read both of his books on the early West. Oh, come on. I just met her a couple of weeks ago. Well, you know what's gonna happen. My dad is gonna take exception to you using him to get a pretty girl in the sack, boy. Oh, come on, buddy. This is my big chance to score some points with her. Come on. Why do you say this? Just invite me to the wedding. All right! This is gonna be great! I knew you wouldn't mind. Besides the more the merrier, right? So they say. I'll see you. Hey, let's get together tonight at Millers for some beer. Pam will be there and it'll give you a chance to meet her before tomorrow. All right. You're on. - See you there about eight. - All right. All right, damn it. Who borrowed my lucky wrench? God. What's the matter? Beer gone sour? No, no, beer is fine. I'm just waiting for a friend. He's, he's late. And almost past your bedtime, right? Is it something I did or you just annoy people at random? I just bother the ones I like. How do you treat the ones you hate? - I see. - You wish. Is there a reply or do you plan to just club her and drag her off by the hair later? Ah, don't you have work to do? I reach in the light. I touch your hand. Looks like some people just can't hold their liquor. You're late, kid. Yeah, well, I wanted to finish up with the manifold. Some things just shouldn't wait until the last minute. Look, Cory, I apologize about this morning. I shouldn't have taken her out without checking with you first. All right, I apologize too. - For what? - For lying. It wasn't your ass I was worried about. It was the pits. Oh. Give me a break. Well, thanks for the concern, bud. So where's your new flame? Here she comes now. Cory, I didn't see you come in. You two know each other? He's awfully quick, isn't he? This is Pam. Yeah. We met already. That's great. Listen, I called your place and your roommate said you were working tonight. Well fortunately, I got off early. I wanna be good and rested for tomorrow. Which reminds me. What time are we leaving? You'll have to ask Hampton here. It's his party. Hampton Sutton? Then your father's Professor Sutton? Yeah. Swing by my place about nine. You got my truck running? Yeah, I got the heads back on this morning. You must be very proud of your father. Very much. Ah, I know the Professor too. In fact, I'm helping him with some research for his new book. Bet you have lots of fascinating stories about him. What are you, some kind of fan or something? I'm studying Texas history. And, well, he is the authority on the subject. I guess he is. Well, well, I guess I better be going. Bring the truck on over in the morning. We'll take it out to dad's house. Uh, would you mind giving me a lift home? I'll give you a ride home, Pam. That's all right, Cory. I'll just be a minute. Well, my dad is the authority on Texas history. See you in the morning, Kid. I never got over you. I never got. Where to? Well to tell you the truth, I'm too wound up to go straight home. How about some coffee? Like I said, where to? How about your place? Well, this must be the place. Just make yourself at home. I'm gonna run upstairs just for a second. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Don't go away. Find anything interesting? God, you scared me. I hope you don't mind. I guess it's the historian in me. I'm just naturally snoopy. That's a funny place to keep a medal. What'd you win? Mutter Ridge. That's Vietnam. September '66. Vietnam? I didn't know you were that old. Thanks for the compliment, I think. It was a terrible war. Is that right? What did you study it in school or something? Maybe you even did a paper on it. Forgive me if I say, I don't give a damn what you think of the war. - My father... - Told you all about it, right? Look, honey, it's the difference between riding a bull and having it described to you. You couldn't possibly understand. My father died in Vietnam. He was a Colonel in the Rangers. They never found his body. Hell, I'm sorry. Seems like I never get tired of the taste of my foot in my mouth. That's okay. I was just a kid. I don't even really remember him that well. It seems like now he was just a stranger that visits me in my dreams. As you sow, Preacher, so shall ye reap. Never mind, boy. It's just an old man's foolishness. I'da caught him if you hadn't rocked the boat! I wouldn't have stood up if you hadn't yelled, "I got one! I got one! At least I got one. I don't see one. Where? That's because you rocked the boat. I'da got him if you didn't rock the boat! There you go. Here. Here, boy. Let's get it done. There we go. There it is. What do you think? Hmm? What's the matter with you, boy? No, you can't be. You're dead. Move it! Come on, old man! I brought along someone to keep you company. What's happening, bud? Universally cosmic. Great. Let's move it. Pam's gonna wonder where we are. Well... Look, Cory, we were talking, it got late. She slept on the couch. That's all. Nothing happened. Come on, kid, what are you... Let's just get going, all right? Cory. - Morning everyone. - Hi. Yeah. Good times roll. Heading for the AM, gonna grab my bag and go. We got a long way to travel headed for the Mission show. We're riding, taking in some Texas soul. We travel Lewisville, Texas. To the mountains of Rosillo. We're off to Panhandle 900 miles down to Mexico. We're riding, taking in some Texas soul. We're riding. Riding and rock and rolling. Rocking and rolling, we're riding. Riding with rock and roll. Rocking and rolling, we're riding. Taking in some Texas soul. Texas Main street filled with so much sounds. They take you to downtown Austin. Hear those good times wind. Hey. Dad! Hey, Dad, we're here! Maybe we caught him napping. Oh yeah. Your dad called yesterday up at the airport. What'd he say? Not much. Thanks for the message. Hey, no problem. Dad? You here? You know the name of the professor's new book? Not being Hampton, I'm not privy to the secrets of the golden circle. I'm just a friend of the family. Look, Corey, you're a nice guy and I like you, but I'll do what I like with whomever I choose. Never said you couldn't. I don't much like the looks of this guy. So what are we gonna do? Uh, there's a creek about three miles down. Dad does some fishing there. You wanna hike over and take a look? Yeah, it's either that or twiddle our thumbs - till he shows up. - Let's go. Hang on one. There's something I gotta get out of the truck. What's that for? Peace of mind. Are you a gun freak? Gun freak? It's just for snakes and stuff. I don't care what it's for. I don't like 'em. Maybe you could leave it behind. Kids. There. Satisfied? Now, anybody seen the atomic kid? Yo, come on! We're heading out! Ah, well, how's our Girl Scout? Fine, god damn it! I love walking in the country. I can see that. "I can see that." Hey, hold it down - for a second. - Ow! Hold it down. A dog? Way out here? - Sounds like Ringo. - Ringo? Yeah, my dad's dog. It sounds like it's coming from the old cemetery. Hey! Wait up! Hey, Ringo! Hey, Ringo, come here! Come here. Hey, boy. Hey, boy. Come here. Yeah, where's Dad? Where's Daddy? Huh? Dad? Dad? Well he was here. He was trying to make a rubbing from this headstone. Maybe he's coming back this way. That's why he left his stuff. Maybe. Are we gonna wait or what? Well we could leave him a note. Tell him we've gone to the creek. Sound okay to you? Sure. Okay. He should find it here. Okay. Come on, let's go up the creek, Ringo. Come on. Okay, Ringo. Okay, you stay here and wait for Dad. Okay. Okay, right there's the boat. What about the water? Where the hell is it? Right down here. Way bitchin'. All right! I'm ready to get it on! Come on, Cory. Loosen up a little bit. - Yeah. - Have some fun. Yeah, right. No! Hey! I'll get you! Come on! You're not coming in? No thanks, beautiful. You can't tell me this doesn't look good to you. Not even the least bit tempted? Hey, come on. Is this how you bother the ones you like? Look at her. What's Hampton doing now? You don't need to worry about Hampton. He's an okay guy. Yeah? Well how come Pam doesn't like me? I'm a good guy. Yeah, but Hampton's older. See, chicks go for older guys. Oh, they do? - Sure. - Why? Well, basically it's because they're older guys. See, older guys act like they don't care whether you like them or not. - Chicks go for that. - Why? Look, I'm not a chick. I don't know. But older guys got this thing about them. Chicks dig it. Well I'm older. I'm 23. To a 15 year old, you're an older guy. To a 23 year old woman like Pam, you're still a spring chicken. Damn it, I want that woman! Look, listen, Cory. Let me tell you what to do. You just ignore her totally. Totally ignore her. Play hard to get. Treat her like you wouldn't want her if she was the last woman on Earth. She'll love you for it. - Really? - Sure. You see, you start treating a girl too nice, and they start saying, they start thinking there's something wrong with you. That's the way it is with women. Ah, that's crazy. It doesn't have to be sane to be true. Tommy, where did you learn so much about girls? I watched Hampton, dude. So what's next? Get the others, man. Let's get going. We'll check further down the river for Dad. You still worried about your dad? It's been hours. Maybe he decided to go back to his house. He's probably wondering where we are right now. Mm, maybe. But you don't think so. It's just not like Dad to leave his work that way and wander off. - Where's Tommy? - Oh, he went off that way. What's that idiot doing now? I don't know. Let's take a break. It's getting really hot. Yeah. Come on. How long have you known Hampton? Oh, about all my life, it seems. He and my dad were stunt pilots together. Until my dad was killed. Hmm. - Flying? - Yeah. He and Hampton were performing some sort of close maneuver at an air show down near San Antonio. And after something went wrong, their wings touched... and my dad crashed. I know how you feel. It must have been terrible for you. Uh, I was pretty young. I really can't remember too much about it, but Hampton's never really gotten over it. Anyway, after it happened, Hampton, well, he sort of adopted me. Doesn't have a family of his own? No, it's just him and his dad. They're pretty close though. Well what about, what about women? Well, there's always women. No one really special though. I guess Hampton's what you would call a lone wolf. Tommy! Jesus Christ! What is going on? Pam, get down, get down! - What's happening? - Get down, get down, move! - What about Tommy? - Tommy's dead. - What, what's going on? - I don't know! Who the hell are these guys? I don't know! But they've seen us. And we've seen them. So they'll be coming after us. We gotta move. Come on, let's go. We have to go. Hold it, man! Hold it! - Are you okay? - Yeah. How, how do you feel? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Just never had to flee for my life. Look, can we give her a second? Yeah, but not too long. Listen, I'll climb up and see if I can spot those bastards. Okay? You're gonna be okay. Oh, damn. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Here we go. I can move now. Forget that. They've cut us off already. So what do we do? I don't know, it's pretty obvious we're never gonna lose them this way. We gotta get somewhere that horses can't follow. Maybe some thicker brush. This is might work. Let's go! - Let's go. - All right, move out. You think we lost 'em? Maybe. Sorry, it does that. What time is it, anyway? It's five. Well, it'll be dark in another hour. If we can keep clear of 'em till then, maybe we can lose 'em. Why? Why are they doing this? Well now that's the $64,000 question, isn't it? All right, let's split up. Spread out, okay? We'll get back together down the trail here. Come on. Quiet, quiet. That's my dad. Dad! Jesus, Dad, are you okay? God, what's happened to him? Dad, it's Hampton. Dad! Professor Sutton, we're your friends. - Return... - What? - They returned. - Who? Who returned, Dad? Who are they? "The evil men do lives after them." - Shakespeare. - What? Hold it! I think heard something! The gun... It's the gun! Cory! Cory, Cory, are you okay? Yeah. I thought you left that thing behind. So sue me. Come on buddy. We gotta get moving. Let's go. Let's go. - Come on, Dad. - Professor Sutton! - Hampton! - What? Oh my God! Dad! Easy, Dad. Don't try to move now. Jesus, Hampton. This looks like a genuine article. Now look, come on. It might not be too serious. Looks like they got him pretty good above the temple here. Oh my God. Cory! Man, we gotta move! Come on! You better take a look at this. We got a problem. So what's our next move? I don't know. No way... No way we can all make it down this thing. Which leaves us? Which leaves you with a pretty nasty climb down this cliff here. So you better get going. Come on. What about you? My dad can't make it down. He and I will just stay up here and handle the rearguard action. No way, no way, I can't leave you. You've got to! Now go on before I shoot you myself. Give him to me. Oh, Dad. It's okay. Come on, Dad. It's all right. - Hampton! - Go, god damn it! Hampton, are you all right? I'm not holding this fucking spot all night! Now move! Die, die, son of a bitch! Cory, y'all okay down there? Yeah, we're all right. Come on. Come on, Pam. We gotta move. Where are we going? - Back to creek. - What? Come on! Dad, we gotta move. Get up here. Come on, come on, come on! Now listen, listen. - We're gonna have to swim. - Why? The water might help us throw 'em off our trail. Okay? Now come on. Oh my God! Who is he? I don't know. Fisherman, maybe. He's been shot. By those cowboys? That would be my guess. What are they after? I don't know. I don't know. Come on. Let's just, let's just get going. You're gonna be okay, Pam! Just hang in there! What? Come on Dad. I think we can make it to the old house. You can rest there. Just a little further. Here we go. Just a little farther. That's it. - Gun, gun. - I got it right here. I got it right here, Pops. No, no. - What? - The gun... The gun, the gun... Dad, let me get you some water, okay? I'm gonna have to clean you up a little bit. No, no. I'm gonna get you some water. - No! - I'll be right back. -I swear, -No. - Now you stay right here. - No. Dad? Aw shit, Dad. Dad? Where are you, Dad? Dad? Dad? Okay. Wait, wait. What good is the truck gonna do us if Hampton has the keys? Look, if I can keep a plane in the air, I think I can hot wire one stupid truck. Come on. I think the house is just up here. Come on. Well, goddamn. How many of you guys are there anyway? Okay. It's like in the movies, right? Good guys always win! I hope I can get her going. Shit! Why do you have to be so safe? A wheel lock? We're in the middle of nowhere? Who the hell did he think would steal it? What does it matter? He locked it and we're screwed. Can't you just cut it or something? Well, if it were that easy, it wouldn't be much of a lock, now would it? We'll just have to wait for Hampton. - Hampton's dead. - You don't know that! And if we can't go get him, we wait here. You heard the gun fire same as me. You know what they're capable of. But you don't know Hampton! - I know he was your friend, but- -But nothing! Look, long after you put this out of your mind, I'll still be thinking about the day I left my friend to die! Looks like we've had a little bit of company here. Oh my God. What are they looking for? I don't know, but I hope they found it 'cause I'm, I'm tired of messing with these guys. Now come on. You gotta let me take a look at that arm. Come on. Let me see. Let me see. I'm gonna see if I can find some bandages. And something to clean you up. Let me see. All right. Come on, breathe. Okay. Okay. Here, hold that. Now we'll see. We're gonna have to be ready. Just in case those guys come back. Here. Drink this. - For the pain. - Thanks. This is incredible. Really fucking incredible. No electricity, no phone. No car. No car? Why didn't the professor have a car? I don't know. So what are we gonna do? - If Hampton were here... - Hampton's not here. We're gonna have to figure this one out on our own. It's time to grow up, Cory. Hey. I'm sorry. Yeah. Who is Reverend Thadeous Sutton? That was Hampton's great grandpa. Some people think it was suicide. The professor thinks that he was murdered. Think we lost 'em in the woods? Maybe. Maybe they're not coming back. Maybe. Listen, why don't you stretch out. And give that arm a rest. Okay? - Cory. - What? Are we gonna die? Eventually. I'm gonna try like to hell to make sure it doesn't happen tonight. Come on now. Get some sleep. Okay? Pam, wake up! - It's Hampton! - Hampton? Yeah. He's back! Cory, Pam! Let's haul it on outta here! Hey, you're all right. You're okay. It's just a bad dream. Where'd you go? I was rigging a surprise for our friends, just in case. Four? It will be light in another hour. You've been sleeping a long time. What's that? I hope I can improvise a bit. Great. You mind if I ask you something? Back there in the woods with the professor, you said something about Shakespeare. Yeah, that was professor's last words. They were from Shakespeare, "Julius Caesar." "The evil that men do lives after them. The good is oft interred with their bones." Cory, that man by the river... The candidate for cosmetic surgery. Yeah, he... I had the strangest feeling I'd seen him before somewhere. Yeah, hanging on the post office wall. Hanging? Cory, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but... Someone's out there! I think he's heading for the door. Cory! Open up, it's me. Watch the window. Jesus! Hampton! Damn man, help me. Well, I tried to unlock the truck, but I must have lost my keys. - Come on. - What? Hey. Are you all right? Are you okay? Hey, hey, I outfoxed 'em, man. I fell off the fucking cliff! What about your dad? He wasn't bad. All in a day's work. Try it sometime. I'm sorry, man. Yeah, well, there will be plenty of times more later. Right now, we gotta get the hell out of here. They'll be coming. I heard a horse earlier. Oh, shit. It's too late. They're out there waiting for us to make a move. Who are these guys? I don't know. But one thing's for sure, they don't seem to be the quitting type. Well, we can't hold out all night. I mean, God, every time we knock one down, there's another one to take his place. There's something not right about those men. Before you came in, I was talking to Cory about the man with a scar on his face. Yeah. The one I shot. No you didn't. I bashed his head in down by the river. You both killed him. What do you mean? But your great-grandfather hung him first. Look, you recognize him? That's the guy. Yeah, that's the guy. I wouldn't some face like that. And he had an empty holster. What? That's what Dad was trying to tell us. - What? - The gun. The gun, man! The gun! Gun. There it is. It belonged to Frank Clements. See the initials? F.C. Frank Clements. He was an outlaw. My great-grandfather hung him a hundred years ago today. Hung him? I thought your great-grandfather was a preacher. He was a little overzealous at times. Anyway, after Clements was dead, he hung onto his gun. It stayed with the family from generation to generation. My daddy was gonna give it to me. We've got company. No! Hampton! Dad! You go out there and they'll kill you just as sure as they killed Tommy! They got my father out there! And there's nothing you can do about it! Oh my God. No! No! No! Hampton! No! Those bastards! - Those fucking bastards! - What are we gonna do? We can't just sit here! We gotta do something! Yeah, the only chance is that jeep. What Jeep? Dad keeps a Jeep out behind the tool shed there. It's about 200 yards there. I'm gonna go out there and get the Jeep. I'm gonna drive it right in front here, Cory. Take one of these grenades. We'll cover you from here. When I get here, we are gonna ride the hell oughta here, man. Okay? Let's do it. Hampton... Be careful, Hampton. Cory, man. You're the best friend I got. She slept on the couch. That's all. Thanks, Hampton. Here we go. I don't see anything. There he is. Careful, Hampton! No! No! Hampton! Take the shotgun and cover the window. What's the use? There's too many of them. They just keep coming. So you wanna give up? Let them kill you? They're gonna get us sooner or later. Hampton just died trying to save our asses! And you wanna give up without a fight? I'm not gonna! I say we fight to the end! Come on, what do you say? It looks like this is it. I guess so. Cory! You get out of the house, you get as far away as you can and you connect these leads, all right? After you've done that, when you hear my signal, you press this red button. - Okay? - Why? What's gonna happen? I rigged the house with black powder bombs. When you press this button, it'll set 'em off. I'm gonna lure these guys in there and we're gonna blow 'em away! Okay? - Here, give me this. - Got it. Go! Go! Bring it on, you bastards! Now, Pam, now! It won't work! Damn it! You, you're all dead! You're all dead! No! My God, Cory, look! Where'd he go? Back to Hell. Let's just hope this time he'll stay there. Damn you to the bottomless perdition, Frank Clements. May your soul never rest. Some men lose their lives too early. Some men never make the play at all. Me, I'm just a dish out on the table. Counting rules and hoping time to stall. If I had a second life to give you. And yielded arms and captured all your dreams. Brought them to you in a wave of baskets. Through the corners carry such a gleam. Life goes on. Life goes on. Life goes on. Today. I met a girl who loved me for a season. She read my hand and sang out all her songs. But when that winter wind came down that highway. The playing cars were Scattered one by one. Perhaps another night out running to save her. Another night in a distant pair of eyes. And me, I stood there counting my reflections. Turning, spinning slowly through to survive. But life goes on. Life goes on. Life goes on. Today. When I went to war inside the city. I fell to love...
