I've come here tonight to pay my respects to our 39th president, our new commander-in-chief, and to wish you godspeed, sir, in the uncharted waters ahead. I am considered a member of the opposition, the loyal opposition... Accent on the loyal. I'd have it no other way. [Applause] - John Wayne was a wonderful American. We would disagree on a lot of politics but we probably would not have gotten the Panama canal treaties passed if it hadn't been for John Wayne. He was good friends with the president of Panama, and he talked to all the Republicans. Oh, he called every republican senator several times, trying to get them to vote with us on those things. So it was a way...The commonality of what you believed in and getting it done was something that was happening back there. - In conclusion, may I add my voice to the millions of others around the world... That wish you good well, Mr. President. We ask only one thing: That you preserve this one nation, under god, with Liberty and justice for all, and we know that you will, sir. Thank you. - It was a really pleasant night. Everybody was, you know, happy for him and, uh, surprised that John Wayne showed up. It was an honor to be asked to perform. I'd like to dedicate this song to Jimmy Carter in the hopes that perhaps a time of righteousness and dignity may now be upon us.

Thank you very much for helping me get here and being the president of the greatest country on earth. Are you having a good time? So are we. - I can definitely feel in my heart that we helped him become president. You know, I mean a lot of other people did too, you know, but...but we had a hand in it. - This is great. - You're looking good. - Gregg Allman was one of the first persons I invited to the white house when I got to be president. He came there with Cher as a matter of fact. - I had dinner with him the first night he had dinner in the white house. They were showing them where to put the spoons and the plates and all this, you know. They had the finger bowls. - Being from plains, we had never had finger bowls. We showed up at the white house, and at lunch and dinner they put a crystal bowl with water in it and a lemon geranium leaf in it, and what you're supposed to do is use the leaf to rub your fingers and rinse in the finger bowl, and then we often times sat there with guests who had never had a finger bowl, like gregg and Cher. - And she picked up the glass and started drinking it. It had a little gardenia floating in it and a lemon. - And we all sat there talking, and when they finished all of us washed our hands in the finger bowls and then moved on to the next course. - ♪ I love to take a photograph ♪ ♪ so mama don't take my kodachrome away ♪ - You know, the white house was a great place to live, and the music was fabulous. - Various entertainers would come to the white house, and sometimes unannounced, and the president's office didn't know what to do with them. So many times they would just call and say, "Crosby, stills and Nash are...Are at the front gate, "and, uh, we don't have them scheduled to see the president. Can you take care of them?" And my office was in the west wing in the basement, and they just sort of hung out. Everybody would come by and meet them and... And then finally took them in to see the president. - ♪ Will you come see me ♪ ♪ Thursdays and Saturdays ♪ - This is the first-time young people were kind of in charge. This was really groundbreaking, when you'd come out of the Nixon era, you know? And so actually they liked and listened to rock-and-roll, and wasn't...We weren't just window dressing, and...and then when we went to the white house, we were welcomed in. - It was kind of funny, because I was on crutches at the time. I had just been to Jamaica, I think it was, and I got busted down there. So one, I was so glad to get out of jail that I jumped off the porch and sprung my ankle. So when I went to...Then the next day, I had to go see the president of the United States. So it was really kind of funny, and we laughed about it a lot. - Yeah. [Rock music] - Oh! ♪ ♪ - President Carter has an encyclopedic knowledge of all music, not just rock and roll. You know, he has a deep knowledge...Deep, deep knowledge of classical music, but he also knows a lot about blues and a lot...An awful lot about jazz. - When I had this opportunity to produce music at the white house, it was one of those moving moments in...In my life in jazz. - Many concerts were held at the white house, maybe more than any other four years. The jazz concert was the one I remember the most. It was just magical. [Jazz music] ♪ ♪ - Blow! ♪ ♪ - I was deeply infatuated with jazz musicians. So it was a great honor for me and a pleasure to bring to the white house these people that in many cases had not been previously recognized for their great contributions to our society. If there was an indigenous art form, one that was special and peculiar to the United States and represents what we are as a country, I would say that it's jazz. At first, this jazz form was not well accepted in respectable circles. I think there was an element of racism perhaps at the beginning, because most of the famous early performers were black, and particularly in the south, to have black and white musicians playing together was not a normal thing. And I believe that this particular form of music... Of art... Has done as much as anything to break down those barriers and to let us live and work and play and to make beautiful music together. [Applause] - Boy oh boy, there was, um, Cecil Taylor and chick corea. I remember, um, Charlie mingus was there in a wheelchair, you know, but everyone applauded him, and it was wonderful that he was there. - The president walked over to...to mingus and just held his hand. - I remember Charles mingus, I just said something about, "I have confidence in you and I appreciate "what you've done in our country and for our people and for me personally with your own music." - The president, his...His highness... [Laughter] Has asked us to play a tune that we played at the white house when we were here before. - All right. - We're gonna play this tune, in which the name of it is "salt peanuts." [Cheers and applause] Now, wait a minute, but there are some diplomatic strings attached, [laughter] To wit, that the president himself, his majesty... - Right on! [All laughing] - Sing the lyrics to "salt peanuts." - All right, all right! - Dizzy Gillespie asked me to come up and join him in singing "salt peanuts," which is a very peculiar song, and that was the only time I think when I was in the white house that the New York times congratulated me on my rhythm. Not on my tone, but on my rhythm.

I'm just want to...I just want to ask one question: Would you like to go on the road with us? [Laughter] - I might have to after tonight! [Laughter] - President Carter loved jazz. He loved all kinds of music, but he really did love jazz, and I have always thought that music was our best ambassador, and especially jazz because it is so identified with america and being very special to america, and music is one of the, I think, most vibrant, obviously, parts of soft power. - Soft power is the use of culture, uh, music. Jimmy Carter was, I think, the best ever at his understanding of it, mainly because he was a fan. He used music in a way that helped him in his politics. He used music, uh, to entertain members of congress a lot at different events he did on the white house lawn that had never been done quite that way. - We would go out through the crowd with index cards, knowing to go see this particular congressman, 'cause you can talk to him for twenty or thirty minutes and you couldn't get in their office. - I think one of the great events I remember was, um, president Carter had a Nascar event and, uh, had none other than Willie Nelson come and sing. Again, it was outside on the south lawn of the white house. Had race cars come in and had some of the, you know, big-time drivers of that era there and had members of congress, who were just eating this up. - ♪ Irene good night ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Irene good night ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ good night Irene ♪ ♪ good night Irene ♪ ♪ I'll see you in my dreams ♪ ♪ stop your rambling ♪ ♪ and stop your gambling ♪ ♪ stop staying out so late ♪ ♪ late at night ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ and go home to your wife ♪ ♪ and your family ♪ ♪ and stay by the fireside bright ♪ ♪ ♪ - My mother was in charge of all the events that happened at the white house. So when they wanted to do a concert, my mother would be the one that would set it up and say everything that was going around it. - I just want to say it's been a wonderful evening for me, and it could only have been better if Jimmy had been here to hear you, Willie, and your group. - When Willie Nelson came and performed at the white house, and president Carter was at camp David for 13 days with begin and sadat, but he was not there for a good reason. - I have to go back to camp David. I'm sorry, but I want to leave you with one thought. You know how very important the summit is and how much is at stake in these meetings. I want to ask you tonight to continue to pray for Jimmy, for prime minister begin, for president sadat. Pray for them, pray for those who are with them, and that the summit will be a success. Good night. I love every one of you. [Cheers and applause] [Western music] - If you've ever read the history of the talks in camp David between begin and, uh, sadat, it's a riveting story of how many times each of the other sides were willing to pull out, and the fact that Carter was there with his wife, managing the whole thing, going from side to side, not just in policy things but in personality things, all things you really need to do to reconcile people who have hated each other for their lifetimes. [Guitar strumming] - I had been hired, um, very specifically to work on foreign policy issues for the Carter administration, and I have to tell you as somebody that was sitting in Washington, uh, while they all were at camp David, it was fairly nerve-wracking because people kept saying, "when are they coming down? When are they coming down from the mountain?" And they were there for a couple of weeks. - He brings both of these guys, takes them up on the top of that mountain, camp David, and kind of locks them up, and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, and it almost fell apart, and then it starts looking like it's gonna happen, and as Carter realizes that, uh, he's gonna get a deal, he's gonna get, uh, a camp David accords between the biggest army in the middle east, Egypt, and the Israelis. - President Carter really used his knowledge of the subject and his willingness to talk to people in a very direct way to get a result. He was very good, I think, about being able to put himself into other people's shoes, to understand what they needed. - The odds of pulling off this peace treaty between sadat and menachem begin was, you know, slight, and...and a lot of, uh, his international advisors were saying, "don't do this," and Carter had this moment in time that he knew he had a shot at it, so he did. - Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, the president of the arab republic of Egypt, and the prime minister of Israel. [Applause] - He put his life and soul into that, you know? And that...That's been the most important and only breakthrough really in the dilemma of the middle east. - We are privileged to witness tonight a significant achievement in the cause of peace. - President Carter was interested in having a moral foreign policy. He thought that our dedication to human rights, america's value system, was what he wanted to represent, and he did make, um, the pursuit of human rights all over the world one of his basic tenets about national security policy...The best of america. What are we about? [Cheering] [Rock music] - Human rights. The right to live like a human. That's something that president Jimmy Carter, um, tried to make real, uh, with his foreign policy, and he had difficulty implementing it around the world, but at least he was trying. - He sent me to Africa with a note on a torn piece of paper: "I want you to ask African leaders "what they expect of this administration and how we can help them." That's revolutionary. - With the coming of the new year, a new and controversial chapter in america's relationship with Asia. Here in Washington this morning, the flag of the people's republic of China raised for the first time at what's now the Chinese embassy. That ceremony one of several marking the opening of formal U.S. ties with Peking and the end of formal relations with Taiwan. - In terms of opening up to China. President Carter followed through on what had been an opening by a republican president, and I find that the bipartisanship of that is something that is worth noting, given what some of the atmosphere has been on that recently. - How are you? - The, um, Chinese ambassador came and, like president Carter would always do, he'd say, "and if there's anything I can do for you? Is there anything you want?" And the ambassador said, "yes. I'd like to go to Nashville." [Country music] - The president asked me to put that trip together, and it was just a magnificent weekend, 'cause Nashville rolled out the red carpet, at Jimmy Carter's request, for this, you know, first people's republic of China ambassador. Started with a luncheon of every business leader in the music business coming to the bmi conference room, and that lunch ended with Barbara mandrell, as the doors opened, standing there with her combo singing "sleeping single in a double bed," as the interpreter was telling the ambassador what she was singing, he just died laughing. And then the weekend ended with Sunday morning brunch. Minnie Pearl came. June and Johnny cash came. The terrific remembrance I have of this is Dixie rings the bell, you know, and says "breakfast is served." This is Sunday morning; This is Nashville, in 1979. Somebody would've usually said a blessing, but we had our guest from Beijing there, and it was a hesitant moment there, and all of a sudden Johnny cash and June Carter started singing "shall the circle be unbroken." - ♪ Will the circle be unbroken ♪ ♪ by and by lord by and by ♪ ♪ there's a better way of living ♪ ♪ in the sky lord ♪ ♪ in the ♪ ♪ sky ♪ - And then it was great because deng xiaoping came to the United States, and there was a lot of celebrating, justly so.

It's always good to see something come out of the south have an unexpected, uh, achievement. [Chuckles] [Applause] - Well, I think what they underestimated about president Carter was what a dedicated, patriotic, smart, political person he was. People did think that he was just this peanut farmer that had come up from Georgia, forgetting that he had been a governor, that also he had been... Had military service, um, and he was, uh, somebody who loved history, uh, and was somebody that was so proud to be an American. - Ladies and gentlemen, Loretta Lynn!

For god's sake, he was a peanut farmer. He was raised around that music. That was part of that culture. You know, Shakespeare said "if music be the language of love, play on." My favorite is lord Fletcher of saltoun. He said, "were I able to make the ballads of a nation, I need not write its laws."

Um, he's... He's trying to get to, uh, america to get treatment, and there was a lot of pushback from a lot of corners of foreign policy not to do that, afraid of what it would uncork. The thing that's part of that history that I think is not known is kind of the republican foreign policy establishment kind of led the charge on Carter to let the shah in to get his treatment. - I would say very firmly that under no circumstances can the United States give in to the blackmail that seems to be practiced by the demonstrators in Iran and decline to provide the medical service to the shah of Iran, who is very, very ill with cancer. - I kind of don't disagree that that was probably the humanitarian thing to do, but it was part of the problem that led to the hostage situation.

And it in so many ways completely paralyzed the Carter administration, because we had to deal with it day by day. People thought, "why is this happening? We're the most powerful country in the world and we can't rescue these hostages." - My thoughts and my prayers for our hostages in Iran are as though they were my own sons and daughters. I was under a great deal of strain. A lot of people were advising me to bomb Iran, but I knew that if I bombed Iran, they would kill the hostages first thing. - He was dedicated to getting those hostages home alive, at almost any political cost. Being president is a pretty lonely job. You're all by yourself. Carter would retreat to his study and listen to Willie Nelson. If I remember correctly, at that time it was a gospel music album. He made his decisions in the solitude of that room. - I went into the room where Harry Truman used to have his office, which was next door to the bedroom. I would play Willie Nelson music primarily, so I could think about my problems and say a few prayers. - ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ that saved a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ but now I'm found ♪ ♪ I was blind ♪ ♪ but now I see ♪ - If Iran has brought home one thing to Americans, it is that foreign affairs cannot be separated from our domestic concerns...Concern about the hostages, about oil prices and supply. What concerns people, voters, also concerns politicians. This is a presidential election year, and Iran has upset the best laid plans of most of the candidates. - You know, on a political point, he could've gone in there anytime and attacked in Tehran, multiple lives lost on both sides, and he would've been a hero to the American people, but his only interest was getting the American hostages back alive to their families. - I think a lot of other politically strategic military thinking would've done something a bit bolder. But the hostage thing I think amplified a lot of the fears that people had had about him. [Gentle music] - His error was that, when you'd raise something that this is gonna be good for you politically, he didn't wanna hear it. He said, "what is the right thing to do?" - Go Jimmy! - The 1980 re-election campaign opened up in kind of the north part of Alabama. - We've got Charlie Daniels here. - Well, Charlie Daniels. Look at Charlie. I mean, he's pretty...A pretty good republican, but he was a great friend, and he and Carter got along well, and he did a concert with the president. - When the president arrived, the secret service was all uptight, because a whole delegation of ku klux klan folks had shown up to heckle, jeer, and wave signs at him.

There'd been outrageous inflation in this country through about three presidents. You had 18% interest, you had 18% inflation, and you had the price of gas through the ceiling, and you had long lines, back in '79 and '80, people running out of gas. It made Carter appear like he was weak. - Are you and your family more secure after 4 years of Jimmy Carter? All: No! - And is america still a country that enjoys respect throughout the world? All: "No!" - I think there was a sense of spiritual depression, where there was a sense in which we were stuck. Then the cultural climate changed because of all of the various factors, economic and geopolitical. The global climate and the national climate changed, and I think that tilted the election as much as anything else. - It was the one-year anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis, and all the networks had special programs, and president Carter's numbers just took a nosedive. - Our election map tells the story of the presidential race. Carter won 52 electoral votes, Reagan in a landslide, 486, Anderson none. - I wasn't surprised when he lost to Reagan, but I was deeply disappointed, profoundly disappointed. - I've always felt, all along, that he got the shortest end of the stick of any president that I could think of in modern history. - We all felt so bad for him, because we felt like he had done so much. - The irony of the Carter presidency, of course, is that many of his accomplishments, accomplishments about which he is proud, are in the hands of the man who is going to be sworn in next Tuesday, Ronald Reagan. Such accomplishments as an energy policy or a separate education department, the deregulation of business or the reorganization of the government...All those could be undone by Ronald Reagan. - I was one of the last people in the white house when the administration changed. And I had gone out to Andrews air force base with a lot of other people to go and say goodbye to president Carter, and it was at that moment that the hostages were released to President Reagan. - There were tears in the eyes of Mr. Carter's aides when the presidential jet went out of its way to fly over the white house one last time. In plains, Mr. Carter made his first public statement since the freeing of the hostages. - Just a few moments ago, on air force one, before we landed at Warner Robins, I had received word officially for the first time that the aircraft carrying the 52 American hostages had cleared Iranian airspace, on the first leg of a journey home, and that every one of the 52 hostages was alive, was well, and free. - He was praising that day, you know. It was like, that's what he wanted. He didn't care about how and when it happened. He...that's just what he wanted to see happen. That's the day that I just fell more in love with him, because he is the true definition of "love one another." - He resolved the crisis in a peaceful way, with humility. It took a lot of courage to do that. - I tried, when I was president, to preserve the peace, and I'm grateful now that I went through four years in the white house, and we never dropped a bomb, we never fired a missile, we never shot a bullet to kill another person. And I would say that my religious commitment to the prince of peace was an important part of one of the basic principles that I tried to pursue. [Pensive music] - I think he took that loss with incredible grace and dignity. I'm sure he had to think a lot about what he was going to do. I think he probably entertained the idea of coming to Atlanta and living and maybe working out of Atlanta, but he made the decision...He and rosalynn...To go back to plains, Georgia, and I thought that was very cool. Go back to the small town. Be who you are. - It worked out well. You know, we ended up coming home and starting the Carter center and starting off our new lives, so you know, we missed the white house, sure, but...and what we might be able to accomplish there...But it didn't slow down, you know, dad's desire to help people. - We heard president Carter speak and he talked about when he and rosalynn left the white house and he said, "we realized that we had a lot of life left "and we had to sit and figure out what we wanted to do with our lives." And I think that there has not been a president, with no disrespect to anyone who's come before or after... - Amen. - Who has done more since they left office than even they did when they were in office. And I think it's a testament to them as a couple, just the humanitarians that they have been to us as a nation and to our world. [Banjo music] - The Carter center is a joint between my parents, and we only do projects that nobody else is doing. So we'll take the lead on Guinea worm and some of these things that are not household names and are not diseases that are here in the United States but certainly are worldwide. - I associate president Carter with the all but eradication of Guinea worm and, you know, he used to carry a jar of Guinea worm around with him and frighten people into action. - If the worm comes out of a joint, say, in your knee, it swells up and destroys the tissue. So the aftermath is very similar to polio. It completely debilitates that knee, and sometimes the knee...The leg is crippled for the rest of one's life. - When we were fighting hiv/aids, and I'd have the antiretroviral drugs and say, "look, if you just had three of these, you stay alive. Three of these a day," and I'd show people what they looked like. Eventually became one, but it was three. I got that from Jimmy. - As far as the Carter center is concerned, I would like to see Guinea worm completely eradicated before I die. I'd like for the last Guinea worm to die before I do. [Laughter] - President Carter and the Carter center, I know...And I know this from travels in Africa and around the world... They're trusted. And the truth is, they have the level of trust that you don't often see around the world from an institution that's embedded in america. - This morning, former president Jimmy Carter won the nobel peace prize.

[Upbeat music] - She's been a good, calming influence on dad, and she has changed his mind, politically, on some big issues that I really appreciated, like the death penalty, for instance. My mother was always been against it. Dad always had a few exceptions that he would accept, and my mother for years would not accept a single exception that he did, and now dad's against the death penalty. So she has changed him over the years. - What I've learned from her is probably the greatest gift in a marriage is to take the supporting role. It takes a lot more strength. It takes a lot more Patience. And then, that's why I guess always when the light shines on her, she just blows you away. - Rosa and I have been involved in habitat for humanity for 40 years, and 35 years in a row we have devoted a full week to building houses. One year, we'd go overseas, and the next year, we'd build somewhere in the United States. And I would say the best habitat volunteers we have ever had with us have been garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood. They went with us twice to Haiti after the earthquake devastated that country. - You know, they say everything comes from the top down. Well, the top at habitat are the Carters. The guy is 40 years older than me and he runs circles around me. - People all over the world are basically the same. They want to have a good life; they want to have basic human rights. And human rights is not just freedom of speech or freedom of religion, but it's the right to have a decent home and place to live. - When I look and see the homeowners and then I see all the wonderful volunteers who are just working to do something good for somebody who needs help, so I thank you. - When the build is done, okay, when everybody can't walk one more second further, this is when the Carters start. They'll go around, house-to-house, they'll take pictures with a group, because what he tells you when you first get there... "If we're taking a picture, "it's going to put three of us out of work: You, me, and whoever's taking then picture." Right? So we don't take pictures. We'll all take pictures at the end. That shows you how quick he's ready to get to work. It's not a competition. This is his words: "It's not a competition, as long as our house gets done first." That's...that's how he does it. [Cheers and applause] - "Itinerant songsters visit our village." When some poets came to plains one night, two with guitars, their poems taught us how to look and maybe laugh at what we were and felt and thought. After that, I rushed to write in fumbling lines why we should care about a distant starving child. I found my words would seldom flow, and then I turned to closer, simpler themes: A pony, mama as a nurse, the sight of geese, the song of whales, a pasture gate, a racist curse, a possum hunt, a battle prayer. I learned from poetry that art is best derived from artless things, that mysteries might be explored and understood from that which Springs most freely from mind and heart. As a teenager I began to hear a lot about this poetic figure who was running for president of the United States. He quoted Bob Dylan, who was at that time my actual president of the United States, my United States. He campaigned with the Allman brothers. You got the feeling if his hair was just a little longer he'd be in the Allman brothers. But this was the first world leader I ever heard who knew the words to all the songs that were my generation's telegraph.

That was not the case for president Carter. [Mellow guitar music] ♪ ♪ - We have any visitors here? [Laughter] Okay. And where are you from?

"He takes his time, doesn't live too fast. "Troubles come, but they will pass. "Find a woman and find love. And don't forget there's always someone above." There's many sides to him. He's a nuclear engineer, woodworking carpenter. He's also a poet. He's a dirt farmer.

Music is the voice of the soul. When you talk about heart and soul, I think he's the president, in my mind, of my living time, that I can think of, that brought it to the office. - I think music is the best proof that people have one thing in common, no matter where they live, no matter what language they speak. In the future, I think we'll recognize that some of our religious beliefs, belief in the truth, belief in helping others, and our faith in democracy and freedom, those are the kind of things that are similar to music that we can share and that eventually will bring us together, even after a divisive era of our constantly changing history. - ♪ Be a simple ♪ ♪ be a simple man ♪ - Governor, to what extent do you feel you will succeed, and I mean by that, will you be satisfied if you just get through it or do you really think that you have a chance for greatness? - Well, I hope I have a chance to exemplify accurately what the American people are and what they would like to be.
