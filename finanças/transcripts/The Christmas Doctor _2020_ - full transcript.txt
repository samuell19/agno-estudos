Santa brought something extra special for you this Christmas. Thank you, Dr. Zoey! Newark General. Day eight of eight. Sure we can't get you to stay on? Thanks, but I'm kind of used to moving around. Can't hit a moving target, right? Something like that. Merry Christmas. You too, Doc. Let me guess. Pad Thai and fire-roasted chicken? No. Open the takeout box. Hanging up now! Not before you tell me you're taking the holidays off this year. Debra. How long's it been since we spent Christmas together? Last year. Uh! Doesn't count. That was over Skype. We did Thanksgiving in October. The 4th of July and Easter... you were working. Where was I on Groundhog Day? Mom would want us to be together on Christmas. And speaking of Mom, what would she say if she saw those bare walls? What would she say if she saw that sweater you have on? Wait till you see the one I got one for you. Then it's settled. Christmas at my house. Talk tomorrow? Okay. Love you. You too, Ty. Why are you looking at that doctors list? I'm not leaving this place without a doctor. Knowing you, you'll be back to work in a day. Gabby, did it ever occur to you I might want to take a few weeks off? No. Yeah, you're right. At least pick someone I can boss around. Of course. That's my number-one requirement. Oh, come on. We both know you only got one move. Make that two. Check. And... mate. Aw, no! Rematch tomorrow after your patrol? I'll be here. Dr. Garner. Willow Brook. Where is that? Well, that's not really what I do. Can you find me something else? Maybe something in a bigger city? Hey! Hey. What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood. Come on in. Upstate. Way upstate. They only have one doctor and he's having surgery. One doctor? How small is this town? Maybe a little bigger than your house. But why does it have to be you? I'm guessing I'm the only one who'd say yes. So we're not doing Christmas? Yes, we are! Right now. And... -You didn't. -Wait... There's more. Bam! Well, at least we're celebrating in December this year. Here. Ooh! Thank you. Aw, Zoey. Now I have to get you something! ♪ O, come, all ye faithful ♪ ♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪ ♪ O, come, ye ♪ ♪ O, come, ye To Bethlehem ♪ ♪ Come and behold him ♪ ♪ Born the King of Angels... ♪ Merry Christmas, Santa. Hello? Anyone here? Ow! Oh, I am so sorry. Are you all right? Yeah. Uh, are you sure? I could have a look at it. Are you saying I need to get my head examined? Do you? Probably. I'm here to see Dr. Raymond Johnson? Oh, so you're the Rent-A-Doc, huh? Locum tenens. Gesundheit. Uh, Dr. Ray's on a house call. House call? Yeah. Shouldn't be long. I'm Dr. Garner. Zoey. Luke Barnes. Do you work here? No. No. Just helping a friend. Updating the computer from the Dark Ages. Is it always this quiet around here? Should pick up after lunch. It's Meatloaf Monday at the diner. Welcome to Willow Brook. Thank you. All right. Dr. Garner. I'm Gabby. We spoke on the phone. Oh, it's nice to finally meet you. Coffee? Christmas blend. Sure. I'd love some. Good news, bad news. Your rental fell through, but there's a charming house I know of that happens to be empty, and the owner can't say no to me. No one can. I really don't need a whole house. Don't worry, you'll love this place. That is so thoughtful. It's important to feel at home in a place. You made it. Dr. Johnson? Nobody calls me that. It's just "Ray" or "Dr. Ray." Thanks for bailing us out over the holidays. Well, it doesn't look like you need much bailing. Well, you never know. It is... Meatloaf Monday. The wall of fame. Those are all your patients? Oh, I've delivered almost all the kids in this town, and a lot of their parents. So when do you have surgery? Ah, tomorrow. Nothing serious, just a rotator cuff. I've been putting it off. Must be painful. Mm, it's not as painful as leaving my clinic. I'm not used to taking time off, but my wife put her foot down. Oh, yeah. Now, this is our "operating theater". X-ray machine, defibs, ultrasound... EKG. We do limited surgeries. The closest big hospital's Buffalo, 60 miles east. MRI? Buffalo. Know it well. Mm. You like to move around. Well, I've been with Locum for six years, and before that, I was with the military. I saw that. 15 years. What brought you back? It was time. Now I just go where I'm needed. Well, you're gonna find things a lot different here. There's not that much going on, but you're always on the clock. You go to the grocery store, somebody's gonna want to talk to you about a rash. Rash on aisle three. Got it. There you have it. And over here, we have good, old-fashioned bribery for the under-12s. Switched to sugar-free after a few complaints from the local dentist. Dr. Ray will know. I'll be right there, Francis! This isn't a war zone, but you will take some friendly fire. Francis? This is Dr. Garner. She'll be filling in for a couple of weeks. Be a good time for you to get to know each other, seeing as you're in here quite a bit. What happened to your hand? Snowball. Snowball? Her cat. Oh. Well, why don't you let me take a look at it? Francis, let her see your hand. Well, that doesn't look too bad. A little Neosporin, some aspirin as needed, it'll be just fine. Dr. Ray, would you mind taking a look? I concur with Dr. Garner. And maybe buy a different cat food. Oh. Thank you, Dr. Ray. She'll get used to you. Hello? Hello? Is anybody home? Hello? Ah! Oh, I'm so sorry. Again? Don't you take an oath to "do no harm"? This is your house? It's my mom's. She passed a few years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. Thanks. Maybe I should take a look at that. Oh... No, I'm fine. You ever had a concussion? No. But at this rate... Dizziness? I'm okay. What year is it? 1985. What? Look around you. It really is 1985. Yeah, Mom wasn't big on change. I'm planning to fix it up after the holidays. Just let me just tighten this. You have a channel-lock? Huh? Oh, I have no idea. Here you go. Oh... thanks. I'm really more of a techie. Oh. All right... How about that? Nice. That worked. Sure. That'll be $500. Check's in the mail. Let me show you to your room. Wait. Is that a VCR? Yep. We also got a transistor radio and a princess phone. Quite the list of amenities. You know how to fix a heater? Maybe. Good, 'cause that's the one thing I can't fix. It's okay. I don't get cold. Here you are. Ah. Why do I get the feeling that you weren't planning on renting this place? Oh, I was eventually. There's some fresh towels for you. Let me show you the rest of the place. I don't know what Gabby said to you, but I saw an inn on the way here. Booked for the holidays. There's got to be someplace else. Nope. Already checked. Look. It's no big deal, really. I'm just preoccupied... it's my daughter, she's coming home from college tomorrow, so. Well, thank you, and don't worry. You won't hear from me or see me again. My number's by the princess phone for emergencies. Well, when that phone doesn't ring, you'll know it's me. Okay, well, then I guess I won't be seeing you. I guess not. All right. I got it. Willow Brook. Day one of 14. He's divorced. -Who? -Luke. In case you were wondering. I was wondering where the tongue depressors are. And please don't say "in Buffalo." His wife left when his daughter was 14. Since then, all he's done is work and devote himself to being a single dad. Now that Lilly's in college, he'll need another excuse... like fixing up that house. Syringes? You're single, right? It was in your records. That was in my records? I may have dug a little deeper... and yes, I'm prying, it's what I do. You'll get used to it. -What's wrong, honey? -Sorry to drop in, I just need a minute with Dr. Ray. Well, I'm sure we can squeeze you in. I'm Dr. Garner, I'm filling in. I'll just come back. Oh, oh. Whoa. How about I just have a quick look? 'Kay? You've been through a lot. Bloodwork, scans. Lots of tests, no answers? I don't usually come in anymore, but I woke up dizzy. And this has happened before? Yes, but it usually goes away. Everyone just says "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" because they don't know what it is. Everyone? The Internet. Ahh! Well... my first recommendation is, never take medical advice from Google. I've gone from a mild headache to "clinically dead" in three clicks. All right... Let's see. I'll take a look at you. When did your symptoms first start? About a year ago. They come and go. I get achy, tired. Headaches. I forget things. Stupid things I should know. It's brain fog. Okay. Anything change a year ago? No. No change to your diet? New home? Pets? A new carpet? No, everything's the same. All right. What about work? I work from home. Honestly, I've gone through all these questions with Dr. Ray. Okay, well, I'm gonna prescribe something to you for your dizziness, but for right now, I need you to lay on your side. Okay? Yeah, just like that. Bring your knees up. Okay? This is gonna help with the vertigo. I want you to rest here for a few minutes, and I'll be right back to check on you, okay? Okay. Okay, great news. Thank you. Dr. Ray's out of surgery. It went well. That's great. He'll be home tomorrow. The challenge will be keeping him there. He's a horrible patient. In other words, a typical doctor. Oh, yeah! As long as he's 100% by the Township Hero Awards. What is the "Township Hero Awards"? Every Christmas season, the county honors someone for their dedication. This year, it's Dr. Ray. And mum's the word... it's a surprise. Be right with you, Terry! He comes in for someone to talk to. Depressed? Lonely. At 11:00, you have a strep test and a hockey injury. 'Kay. Figured I'd find you working. Sweetie! You're early. No traffic. You didn't speed, did you? Didn't speed, got a good night's sleep, and I'm wearing a sweater. Oh! I got a surprise for you. ♪ Tis the season... ♪ ♪ ...To be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la... ♪ ♪ ...La, la, la, la ♪ It's better than last year's tree lighting. Yeah. I forgot a few "la-las." It happens. The whole song has, like, 10 words. Told you not to bring me on stage. Ah, good news. I'm hiring an intern this summer, so you'll have someone working under you. Yeah. I thought you'd be happy to have someone else do coffee runs. Summer's a long way off. It's not that long. -You hungry? -Starved. All right. Tamale Tuesdays! And there's a meteor shower tonight, so it's telescope and popcorn on the back porch. Actually, I kinda have plans later. Ashley's having a party. Well, that sounds more fun. -Yeah, we'll catch the next one. -You sure? You seen one meteor, you seen 'em all, right? Yeah. Lilly! How's college, honey? Great, Katie. Did you get your giant tree yet? Ask your father. He helped me carry it in. And move out her living-room furniture to make room for it. Well, we've all missed you. So... flour tortillas for Luke, corn for Lilly, spicy for him, mild for you, extra guac and... two apple ciders... one hot, one cold. So, coding class, tell me about it. Yeah. It... It's great. The candle store's been there a hundred years, and I've been shopping there almost as long. Merry Christmas, Doc! Welcome to Willow Brook. Merry Christmas. Chocolate shop, to die for. Bakery... if you like yule logs, and who doesn't?... a must. And... here's our diner. Look who's here. Well, my shopping list awaits. See you tomorrow. Who's that? Dr. Ray's fill-in. She's staying at the old house through Christmas. You trying to punish her? Uh, quite the opposite, actually. Seen here twice, been injured twice, and she's only been here a day. When I said you'd never see me again, I didn't realize... I'm everywhere. Uh, Lilly, this is Dr. Garner. Zoey. Wow. You've really grown up. You know me? The elf photos on your grandmother's wall. Oh, no! Not the elf photo. Those are still up? 'Fraid so. Table for three, Dr. Garner? Uh, no, I'm just here for takeout. No, you should join us. Right, Dad? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course. Thank you, but I should really be getting back to the house. I got stuff. Plus, that VCR's not gonna watch itself, right? Right. I'll put those elf photos in the drawer for you. Thanks. I like her. She's just here for a few weeks. Mm-hmm. In the old house. You never let anyone stay there. Believe me, it wasn't my idea. Let me guess. Gabby? That'd be a yes. Whose house is it? Luke Barnes, mid-40s, software designer, doesn't know what a channel-lock is, and possibly accident-prone. Is he a patient or your landlord? Neither. He got talked into letting me stay here. What does he look like? Uh, you know. No, I don't. He looks okay. All right, he's more than okay. All right, he's really good-looking, but that is the last thing I'm thinking about. What's the first thing? Tamale Tuesday. Love you, sis. Good morning. Good morning! Oh... you didn't have to bring anything. I invited you. It's not for you. It's for your wife, for putting up with you. I hear you are a terrible patient. Well, that's no rumor. And she'll love it. Thank you. Shouldn't you be inside? I'm bird-watching. Oh... Northern Cardinal. Hold still. Yes, Captain. Actually, that's "Major." Did you know it's good luck when you see a cardinal? No. The story has it that the cardinal is someone who loved you, from your past, who's looking in on you. Maybe that explains why I've never seen one before. And it's gone. For now. Thanks. So... no problems at the clinic, except for Francis... something about her elbow. Says, "Dr. Ray would know" and won't let me see it. Knitting elbow. Uh, one sprained ankle, two earaches, two stitches, and a partridge in a pear tree. This is lighter fare than you're used to seeing. Yeah, but there is someone I wanted to ask you about. Her symptoms are all over the map. Oh, Emma Hayes. We've tested her for everything. She used to be so outgoing. This has really taken a toll. I'd appreciate it if you'd look in on her. Look in? Yeah, house call. People really still do that? That's what you're doing right now. No, this is a social call. Tomatoes, tomahtoes. Yeah, I'm not really that kind of doctor. I really only see a patient once. In med school, they warned us not to get too attached to your patients. It's fine in the E.R. Someone rolls in, you stitch them up, on to the next one. But here, you get to know your patients... their history, their family... it's all about relationships. Yeah, well, I'm not really good at that. Well, you might see something I missed. In fact, I'll go with you. You're not going anywhere. Can I get a second opinion? Yes. Cut down on the salt. Yes, dear. Oh, one more "yes, dear" and you'll have pain in your other shoulder. Serene, meet Dr. Garner. Zoey, please. Nice to meet you. You too. Uh... for your mantle... ...which I figure could use a little Christmas. Ohh... thank you. Good morning, Santa. Good morning, Doc. Hey, thanks! Hi! -Hi, Dr. Zoey. -Wait a second! You go to Vanderton? So did I! -Really? -Yeah! Go, go, Vanderton! Won't stop till the work is done! Won't stop till we're number one! Go-o-o-o-o, Vanderton! That's funny. So the tamales were good. Today's Waffle Wednesday. I recommend the pumpkin with extra whipped cream. Done! Just a flu shot today, huh? I was supposed to get it on campus, but I kinda forgot. Easy fix. Can you roll up your sleeve for me? How big is the needle? Tiny! That's what Dr. Ray always says. That's what all doctors say. So what are you studying? Computer engineering. Just like your dad? Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Did you always know you were going to be a doctor? No. I had all kinds of ideas. Teacher, firefighter, lawyer. At one point, I even thought I wanted to be an astronaut. So when did you figure it out? My junior year. You know that frozen pond behind the lacrosse field, where everyone skates? Yeah. Well, my roommate caught an edge and hit her head on the ice, and I stopped the bleeding, held onto her until the paramedics came. And that's when I knew. All right. All done. What? I barely felt that. Would you like a candy cane? I'm kinda old for that. Okay, if you say so. Okay, maybe I'll take one. Mm! Or two. Thanks, Dr. Zoey. You're welcome. Come back anytime, if you want to talk. -Bye. -Bye. His patrol was hit by an RPG. He's had four surgeries. The bleeding has stopped, but now we're fighting an infection, so we have to get him stable before transporting him. Keep an eye on him for me. Hey. Mm. Maybe I'll let you win this time. Oh, you're gonna let me win, huh? I'm starting to feel bad for you. Well, you should! I'm 0 for 30. But who's counting? All right. This is my first Christmas away from home. It's funny, the things you think about during the holidays. My sister's crazy Christmas sweaters. My mom's candied yams, with those little marshmallows. I love those little marshmallows! Maybe next Christmas, huh? Definitely. Uh, can we finish this later? Kinda tired. To be continued. There we go. Thank you. You play chess? Oh... uh, no, not really. Not anymore. Dr. Ray used to have that in the waiting room, but the patients got too involved in the game and we couldn't get them into the exam rooms. Did you get Emma's bloodwork back? Just now. I hope I'm not disturbing you. I just wanted to see how you were doing. That's so nice of you. You're my first house call. Today? Ever. Well, come in. Somebody's getting a nice meal. The O'Briens' holiday party. I'm a caterer. And suddenly, I wish I knew the O'Briens. I'll save you a plate. A homecooked meal. It is Christmas. You don't cook? I microwave. I practically grew up in a restaurant. Started catering a few years ago. Looks like it's going pretty well. It was. I'm sorry, I just... I don't even know if I'll have the energy to see my family for the holidays. It's okay. We're gonna figure this out. You know, I think the circuit breaker's in the kitchen. -I checked. -Or the garage. -Checked. -Basement? You don't know where it is, do you? No. In my defense, I haven't lived here since 12th grade. Ohh. Is this your old room? Long time ago. "In a galaxy far, far away." Ohh! I had these on my ceiling, too. Oh, I forgot those were there. One night, I sat on my balcony for four hours, just to see one shooting star. Yeah? Was it worth it? Yep. My record was six hours. On a rooftop. Unfortunately, I fell asleep and missed it. Oh, no circuit breaker... but my old light saber. Sorry. It's gotta be outside. You live in the city? Upper East Side. Not that I'm there much. I used to live that life. Did eight years at a big tech company in Midtown. What brought you back here? I got married. Seemed like a better place to raise a family. Didn't exactly work out according to plan. Gabby might have mentioned something. Of course she did. She also said you are an amazing dad. My daughter thinks I'm a snowplow. One of those annoying parents who wants to remove all obstacles in their way. Are you? Yep. See, the thing is, I'm a child of divorce. Never wanted that for her. Yeah. Well, 100% of divorces start in marriage. You too? Yeah, I met mine in med school. He went into private practice. I went to Afghanistan. Mm. You must have seen a lot. Probably too much. Now, where would someone hide a circuit breaker? You know, sometimes, you don't know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory. -Who said that? -A doctor. Dr. Seuss. Oh! Wait a minute. What do we have here? Ah-hah! I knew it was here all along. Really? It's been 20 years. Try 30. How old do you think I am? 46. Gabby mention that, too? No, I can tell how old a person is by their wallpaper. Ah! Okay. All right, let's see... one of these. Hey! -Nice. -All right. Let there be light. Oh... The only house not decorated for Christmas. Like Darth Vader's. Thanks for coming. Sure. And I won't be calling you again. Please don't. Hey. Are you a cardinal? Winter Finch. Cardinals have more red. Hey, ladies. Ashley, this is... Dr. Zoey! I've been hearing a lot about you. You gave my brother stitches the other day. Hockey injury? Yeah, now he's using these as an excuse to not shovel the driveway, so I have to do it. Well, hey, I could give you stitches too. Thank you. Anyway, I gotta go, but it was really good to meet you. Nice to meet you, too, Ashley. I'll see you later! Bye! Nice snowman. Snow-woman. Even better. So how's your break going? It's nice to be back. Mostly. Oh, I remember those days. You're out on your own, and next thing you know, you're right back under the microscope. Yeah. It'll get better. I know. It's just... my dad. I mean, he's great. He's too great, which is why I don't want to disappoint him. Oh, I'm sure whatever it is, you won't. Everyone always says I'm just like him, you know? We've had all these plans, ever since I was a kid... I'd join his business, we'd be a team. But there's a whole world out there. I'm not sure that's what I want anymore. Have you told him? I just don't know how. It's always been the two of us. It's our thing. You'll find another thing together. Lots of things. You think so? I know so. Look, my parents got past me not becoming an astronaut. You won't tell him that I said anything, right? Doctor/patient/snow-woman confidentiality. Cool. I like her scarf. She's looking pretty good. And this is Dr. Garner. Let's go with "Dr. Zoey." So, I hear you ate too many Christmas cookies. Mm. But they're good, huh? You know what? I do that all the time. You don't mind chopping? Cutting's actually the one thing I'm good at. How come you never learned to cook? Well, I went from dorm food to hospital food to Army food, and now I'm the takeout queen. I could teach you. How much time do you have? This... is a spatula. This... is a stovetop. My sister's a great cook. We used to have these big holiday celebrations. Just someone I've been avoiding. He's cute. Yeah, he's really sweet, too. And that's a problem? I just don't want to see anyone right now. Can I give you some advice? Say yes. What is the worst that could happen? You forget his name? Fall asleep in his car? Who hasn't done that at least once? What would you do? You know that expression, "Do as I say, not as I do"? So I should say yes, but you don't? Yes. It's been a while since I've just hung out with anyone, and I know you're only here because Dr. Ray put you up to it. The first one was for Dr. Ray, but this one's for me. And the next one, because I'm gonna teach you to cook a Christmas dinner. I would settle for a Christmas dish. Oh, which one? The easiest one! Wow! Oh, hey! I'm just about finished. Oh, it's beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, well... I couldn't have you in the only undecorated house in town. Hey, do you like pasta primavera with a reduced red wine sauce and caramelized vegan meatballs? Do I? That'd be a yes. Well, good, because I have a lot. Oh! For you and Lilly. Thank you. Lilly's out with friends tonight, but, uh, I'll enjoy it. Great. So, I guess I won't be seeing you again. You definitely will not. Uh... um... but, if you want... we could eat this alone... together. Your house or mine? They're both your houses. Right. Come on. It's been a while since I've been at this table. This house is really growing on me. Yeah, '85 was a good year. It's so cool that your mom kept everything. I'm never in one place long enough to have any stuff. "Stuff"? Yeah, you know, vases, things on shelves. Mm. I don't know what I'm gonna do with all of it. Maybe I'll open a museum. "The place where time stood still." Gabby said you do the websites for the entire town. Mm-mm. Nope. There are three people that went outside of Willow Brook. We don't speak. Actually, I'm just finishing a virtual digital lighting program for a start-up on Wall Street. Okay, I have no idea what that is, but it sounds amazing. Oh, it will be. And yes, I'm a nerd. Yeah, me too. Little bit. Although, I never had a light saber. What? Oh, you gotta learn the ways of the Force. But you did have a chemistry set, though, right? Two. And an ant farm. Okay. You ever miss living in the city? You know, I thought I would. Turns out, I like to be a part of something. People know you here. Sometimes, they know a bit too much. So what's next for you? Well, I'll go back home for a couple days, then off to my next assignment. You must get tired of moving around. How do you handle it? "Willow Brook. Day four of 14." Just something I tell myself. Started in the Army. Just a way for me to... keep track of how much time I have left. Mm. Guess I'm used to having an exit strategy. You okay? Yeah, I'm sorry. It hits a little harder on the holidays. You know, every doctor has that one patient that they'll always remember. Mine was a soldier. Just a kid, really. I couldn't save him. And I couldn't forgive myself. So I left the Army and... ...just kept moving from place to place. Running, I guess. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I don't even know why I just told you all that. No. It's okay. I'm glad you did. Come with me. Come on. You know, there's something about a tree that just makes me feel better. The way they stand, they're so... ...majestic? Exactly. White Spruce, Fraser Fir, Noble, Douglas Fir... one of the more popular. You sure know a lot about this. He does our website. And you can also ask me about wreaths, tinsel, and garland. Johnny, this is... Dr. Zoey. -Nice to meet you finally. -Oh, thank you. You too. You know, I've meant to come see Dr. Ray. My knee's been acting up. Come see me. Come by tomorrow. Do you know anything about knees? You got two of 'em, right? I will see you tomorrow. -Okay. -Later, Johnny. You know, they say picking out the right tree is a science. I remember being very unscientific when I last picked out a tree. Scotch pine keeps its needles the longest. Balsam, if you like the symmetrical shape. And Fraser fir is good for heavy ornaments. ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ Oh, I'm so sorry. I got to go. Where? Deliver a baby. Bah. Excuses, excuses. Hey. Which tree do you want? The one that smells the best! Balsam or fir. Day five of 14. Nine pounds, three ounces! Congrats. I'm not the one who deserves congratulations. Oh, you bring them into this world, they're always a part of you. Well, you must have a big family. That I do. Wow. It's been a while since I've delivered a baby. Ah, there's nothing like it. And then you get to watch that baby grow up, and then come in with her mom, and then her car, and then, maybe someday, with her own baby. Just how long do you think I'm gonna be here? Well, you never know how things turn out. In my case, we do. Hmm. Do you want to go over these? Uh, I'll look at that later. I'm sorry for keeping you working over the holidays. I always work through the holidays. Seems a little sad. No, I mean, I'm around people. I just don't know them. Last year, it was Rockford General. Year before that, New Haven. You don't mind me saying, I think you could use a family this Christmas. Lattes for me and Zoey. Decaf for Ray. Pretty soon, you'll have me drinking hot water and lemon. You know, that's not a bad idea. How about just hot water? Better yet, how about warm water? Oh, tree lighting tonight. It's not Rockefeller Center, but we do all right. Well, sure, if I have time. It's a thing to make time for. All right. Well, I'd better get back. All right. I'll see you a little bit later, okay? -Bye, Zoey. -Bye-bye. I don't know how you found her, but I'm glad you did. There's something special about her. Ray? What is it? I should have told you before. I just didn't know if I should say anything. Dr. Garner. I'm finished here on Christmas. The 27th? Yeah, sure. I can do that. Oh. ♪ This is for you! ♪ Thank you. It's not from me. Oh. Mrs. Green asked me to bring it by, a thank-you for delivering her granddaughter. That's so sweet. While I'm here, I was wondering if you could look at my elbow. Of course. Thank you. You made the Wall of Fame. The Harris girl's due next week. You might have another one. You're going to need a bigger wall. Big day, too. I got some fruitcake. Save me a piece. I need a new paperweight. That bad, huh? So, when are you going to ask her out? -What? -Text her. Ooh, or, better yet, go to the clinic, get a flu shot, and do it in person. I'm not getting stuck with a needle to get a date. Dad, I know you like her. Ashley said she saw you putting up Christmas lights on her house. Her house? And Johnny told Taylor that you brought her to the tree lot. Because she needed a tree. Yeah. I'm just saying, I think it will be good for you to get back out there. I'm out there. Besides, she leaves in eight days. Or seven. No, eight. Yeah, exactly my point. You're counting the days. The only days I'm counting are the days till the Township Hero Awards. Let me show you what we have so far. You'll get this next semester in your graphics class. Yeah, uh, about that... What, you didn't get into the class? No. That's okay, you can take it sophomore year. What's wrong? Okay, I'm... just going to tell you. Rip off the bandaid, right? What is it? I'm not working here in the summer. Don't tell me you got that internship at RGZ Tech? No, actually... I've dropped computer engineering. When? Two months ago. I left the program. For what? Undeclared. But this is what you always wanted. No, you wanted it. And maybe I did, too, when I was younger, but I don't anymore. Why am I just hearing about this now? Because... I didn't want to hurt your feelings. You put everything on hold for me, and you had all these plans... but those were your plans, not mine. I don't know what to say. Just... say you support me. It's just that you're so good at this. What are you going to do? I don't know, but... I'll figure it out. Lilly... Dad, I love you, and you know that, but I need to live my own life... and you do, too. I've only got about an hour. In an hour, you'll be a one-star chef. Green-bean casserole with fried onion rings. Oh... well, I can open the cans. Let me get these out of the oven. My go-to Christmas yams. The Boys & Girls Club is having their holiday party. Merry Christmas, Private. Candied yams with little marshmallows. Seriously? The good news is I didn't make it. The bad news is it came from the mess hall. It's not quite Christmas at home, but... Mm. It's close enough. Thank you, Doc. You can thank me when you get out of here. Hey... Dr. Zoey? Oh, I'm sorry. I was just remembering something. Food will do that. Every time I see Christmas pudding, I'm six years old again. How long have you had the tremor? Not long. Just... comes and goes sometimes. Carpal Santa Syndrome. Try to ring the bell with your arm, and not your wrist. Feels better already. Good. Here you go. Thanks, Doc. See you at the Tree Ceremony? We'll be there. Like she said. Hey, there's a wreath on my car. Johnny from the tree lot. His way of saying thanks for fixing up his knee. Aw, that is so sweet. Did I treat anybody who owns a car lot? ♪ Joy to the world... ♪ I could really use a new car. ♪ ...Let earth receive her king ♪ ♪ Let every heart... ♪ The man just won't listen. Easy on that shoulder there, Ray! You're off the clock. I thought I was never off the clock. Everyone's off the clock tonight. I'm so glad you're here, Zoey. -Me too. -Yeah. Dr. Ray. How are you? Francis. A Willow Brook tradition. Everyone makes or buys something small for the tree, and they're distributed to needy kids on Christmas. I didn't bring anything. You have time. -Hey. -Hey. Ear buds and a Firestick? How do you know everything? See you two later. Looks like I've been abandoned. Yeah, you and me both. Apparently, Lilly thinks I need to get a life. Oh, then, she must be talking to my sister, because that's what I hear pretty much every day. You like gingerbread? -I once ate a whole house. -Oh, yeah? I ate a hotel. More like an inn. The Willow Brook Creek Inn. It's small. Hi, I'll take a snowman, please. And I'll have two elves and a reindeer, please. I missed lunch. Fish-stick Friday. It was a good one. Ed, what's wrong with your arm? Nothing anymore. Merry Christmas, Willow Brook. Merry Christmas! Every light on this tree is a shining remembrance of so many who don't have light in their lives. This is for them, and all of us. And as we say every year at this time, let there be light!

Thanks. I've got something for you, too. Oh, Ray... You didn't have to give me these. It's an early Christmas present. Give 'em a try. Thank you. Life throws a lot at us, sometimes things we think we can't overcome, but then a bird shows up, and another, and a nest gets built, and we begin to realize that life goes on, and it can be beautiful again. Like that. Wow. I think I'm going to be using these a lot. Good. I wanted to talk to you about Emma. I heard you became a fan of the house call. Yeah. She's teaching me how to cook. I noticed that she had a tremor. Well, that's new. And I was thinking about a patient I had who had a shrapnel wound. We removed all the fragments, but he was still showing symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, tremors. We tested for lead poisoning. Yes, but... we're missing something. Pancakes? Hey! Peace offering. I've been thinking about what you said, and I'm going to get back in the program. It makes the most sense. And I'll be working in the office next summer. No, you won't. Sweetheart, you're not a kid anymore, and I never meant to treat you like one. I just wanted to make your life easy, that's all. When my parents split up, my childhood ended, and everything felt like it fell apart. When your mom and I split up, I... I felt like I failed you. You... you didn't fail me. I think you're amazing. I just want you to find what makes you happy... and you will. And I'll be right here cheering you on. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, honey. You know, you and Mom may not have worked out, but that doesn't mean there isn't someone else out there. Yeah, I know. So you're not too old to help your old man decorate these pancakes, are you? Never. All right, show me your skills. -There you go. -Thank you. Here we go. Ready? Yeah. Go. Ho ho... ho! Hey, Gabby. Is the doc in? What's wrong? Nothing. So... this is a personal visit? Maybe I'll just come back. Examining Room 1. Thanks, Gabby. Hey. Hey! Wow. You look... professional. I'm not real good at this. I'm a doctor. You can tell me anything. Okay. I have a problem. A tenant problem. A locum tenant problem. Sounds serious. It could be. Well, maybe you need a psychiatrist. I think so. Do you want to have dinner? Are you asking me on a date? I just thought maybe we could eat alone together. Well, I hear Soufflé Sunday's a hot ticket at the diner. Okay. Am I paranoid, or is everyone watching us? Yeah, everyone's watching us. Should we tell them this is not a date? Nah, it'll just give 'em something to talk about. Okay, let me guess. Two soufflé specials. Cold cider for Luke, hot for Zoey. You are a mind reader, Katie. Thanks. How do I tell her I don't like cider? It won't matter. She brings it to me, too. Haven't drank it in, like, five years. That was nice. It was. Well... That tree needs something. Do you mind if I get something from the garage? My house is your house. Literally. Hey, you like fruitcake? It's not Mrs. Green's fruitcake, is it? You've had it before? In 2012. It's still stuck in the back of my throat. Cookies it is. All right. We've got cookies from Miss Lizzie at the bakery, and cocoa from Sara at the chocolate shop. Perfect... ...'cause this might take a while. I've got a while. Did you know there's supposed to be a meteor shower on New Year's Eve? Yeah, I'll watch it from my balcony. Me too. Stainless steel... Mm? What? I think I've just figured out what's wrong with Emma Hayes. Well, that's what a guy wants to hear on a date. Oh, so this is supposed to be a date, huh? You don't want it to be a date? It wouldn't be the worst thing. Oh, now, there's a ringing endorsement. No, I'm sorry, I do. I mean, I do about the date, um, not "I do," I do. I do, too. Stainless steel, huh? I'm so sorry. I know this is really bad timing, but I've been trying to figure this out for a while, and I really think that... It's all right. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, you will. Ray? It's Zoey. So those pots and pans you use? They're infused with nickel. Sometimes, they add it to stainless steel. It gives it that shiny look. If someone's allergic, they most often will get a rash, but in rare occasions, it can present in all kinds of ways. It's called Systematic Nickel Allergy Syndrome. And that's what I have? Dr. Ray just confirmed it with your new bloodwork. I don't believe it. I'm really going to be okay? Get rid of everything in your house with nickel, it should go away on its own. I don't know what to say. This is the best Christmas present ever. I'm so glad. I'm going to call my family and tell them I'm coming home for Christmas! You're like a Christmas miracle. Oh, I think you're giving me way too much credit. Dr. Ray was right to have picked you. Wait, what do you mean, he picked me? It's just the locum people said your background was ERs and trauma centers, but he insisted. Why? It's just the way he is. He gets a feeling about people. Can you cover for me for a minute? Sure. I just want to place this under the tree. Let me guess. A chemistry set. My cousin works in the toy shop. Gabby, girl, you are a trip. Dr. Zoey would know.

Hey, Doc, I got a rash from the fake beard. -What do you recommend? -Don't wear the beard. Cortisone cream. Over the counter. Thanks! Merry Christmas! Where were we? I guess I'd better... Yeah, me too. I'll see you at the awards? I'll be the guy behind the stage tangled up in all the wires. I'll be the girl giving antihistamines to Santa. Merry Christmas, Willow Brook. Merry Christmas! As you all know, every year, Erie County presents the Township Hero Award to someone whose dedication has helped make our world a little better. I'm honored to present this year's award to someone who's been there for me my whole life, from distracting me with candy while he gave me a shot... ...to delivering my amazing daughter. I'm sure he's showed up in the middle of the night for everyone here at least once. I couldn't be happier to present this year's award to my friend, Dr. Raymond Johnson. Dr. Ray! You knew about this? Of course. You're the only one who didn't. Thank you, Luke. Thank you. I didn't know this town could keep a secret. Thank you, all. I'm touched beyond words. It's been my privilege to be able to take care of all of you. You put your trust in me, and I'm so grateful. Well, you've put your trust over the last few weeks in someone else as well, Dr. Zoey Garner. Zoey, would you come up? Please? Thank you for being here, Dr. Zoey. I wouldn't want to be anyplace else. Aw. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this award isn't just for me. It's for all the doctors and nurses, the caregivers and frontline workers everywhere. Yeah! Whoo! ♪ Some kind of miracle you are ♪ ♪ Kept me safe and kept me warm ♪ ♪ Though I've wandered off so far... ♪ ♪ ...You helped me weather all my storms ♪ For me?

Hey! It's Christmas Eve! What are you guys doing? I am making my soon-to-be-world-famous Green-Bean Casserole for eight. That's right, you heard me. I'm sorry we're not together, sis. Next year for sure, okay? Oh! Can I call you back? Okay. Oh, my goodness! What are you doing here? Spending Christmas with you. And that's what we're doing from now on, wherever you are. -Aw... -I came for the yams. Oh, and the green-bean casserole. Get in here. I haven't seen you looking like this in a long time. What do you mean? You're glowing. That's just the reflection from that Christmas sweater. She's right, Zoey. You look happy. Well... I am. Come on. I got a green-bean casserole in the oven. Oh, come on in! I thought you were going to be with your family! On my way. I just wanted to drop this off. A little something I made with my new cookware. Turkey breast? Brined turkey breast with roasted Brussels sprouts and orange sauce. Ooh. Merry Christmas, Emma. Merry Christmas, Zoey. -Bye. -Bye. We are going to be eating for a week. Hey, Gabby. You can start the party now. I'm here! Gabby, this is... Debra and Ty. I feel like I know you two already. Ty, how's the new saltwater aquarium? And how does she know that? Gabby knows everything. I just... I don't know. Oh, hey, it's the most important person in Willow Brook, and her husband! And my candied yams. Ooh, yum. Thank you. Come on in. Thank you. Hey. Hi. Uh, Luke, this is my sister, Debra. It's great to meet you. She's right. You are good-looking. I've been hearing about you since the first near concussion right up to Day 13. -Really? -Mm-hmm. She's exaggerating. The lights, the tree, the diner, the mistletoe, and the light saber. You told her about the light saber? Maybe in passing. Merry Christmas, all. -Hey. -Hi. Hello. You must be Lilly. I'm Zoey's sister. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. And I also went to Vanderton. Go, go, Vanderton! Won't stop till our work is done! Won't stop till we're number one! Go, Vanderton! Wow, this is the nicest Christmas dinner this place has seen since... 1985. -What are you doing later? -Dishes? Okay, I'll wash, you dry. And then maybe we can talk. Sure. Come on in. ♪ Slippin' and a'slidin' on a frozen pond ♪ ♪ All the snow is... ♪ Cheers. Thank you. Yes, cheers. Cheers, everybody! Merry Christmas! Mm. You made all those? Nope. Not one. Oh. Oh, phew. Zoey, Serene and I have been talking for a while now, and over these past few weeks, I've come around to her way of thinking. I'm going to work less, live more. Do some traveling and some other things that we've been putting off. Well, I think that's a great idea. Yeah, I do, too. What I'm trying to say is that I've decided to take on a partner at the clinic, and I can't imagine anyone else fitting in better than you. Me? I don't know what to say. Say yes. I know I've only been here for a short while... you all have made me feel so at home. It's a feeling I haven't had in a long time. But? I'm so sorry, Ray. I already have another assignment. I'm due in Philly in two days. After that, I... I understand. It was just a crazy thought. What's wrong? Nothing. Everything's exactly as it should be. Good night, you two. We're turning in. Shouldn't we help with the... They've got it. -Good night. -Good night. Subtle. In a galaxy far, far away? Hmm? Oh. Yeah, I guess so. You wanted to talk? Yeah, no, it's nothing. Oh. Okay. So, I was thinking that we should stay in touch. Sure, of course. Yeah. Call me anytime. Even if nothing's broken. Same here. I have something... for you. Open it. Oh, wow. Thank you. It's exactly what I needed. Oh, I know. A tool box. Actually, I got something for you, too. Oh, it's beautiful. I thought you should have some "stuff." Thank you. I love it. And I just want you to know that I'm definitely not going to miss you. And I am definitely not going to miss you either. Merry Christmas, Zoey. Merry Christmas. Christmas Morning Rolls. I can't remember the last time we actually got to eat these on Christmas Day. Hey, you got any more of those green beans? It's 9:00 a.m. What? I'm getting started on dinner. I'm so glad you guys came. Christmas together every year, no matter where you are. Deal. Sounds good to me. I'm proud of you and what you do. Thanks, Deb. I'll call when I'm back in the city. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! All right. Bye. -Love you! -Love you! Hey, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Great party. Just what the doctor ordered. Is everything okay? I wanted to talk to you about something. Uh, I've been waiting for the right time to tell you this, and I'm not even sure I should. It wasn't just chance that brought you here. I did. I wrote to you on the base six years ago. It came back unopened. I guess you'd already left by then. My son told me about this amazing doctor who played chess with him every day, and how much her friendship meant to him. I'm so glad that he had you, and I want to thank you for being so much more than a doctor to him. I think about him every day. What I could have done differently, how could I have saved him? No, no, no, you couldn't have. No one... no one could have. But you were there for him when he needed you. He wasn't alone. Your son was so special. And so are you. We're just so glad that we have this chance to spend time with you. Happy New Year! How was Philly? The cheesesteaks were great. The hospital was a madhouse. Ty and I are going to a party. Come out with us. Thanks, I think I'm going to stay in. Don't tell me. Pad Thai and Fire-Roasted Chicken? Lasagna and a meteor shower. Love you, sis. Love you, too. Happy New Year. Tell me you're not spending New Year's Eve working. Don't worry about me. I've got plenty to do. If you want, I can stay another day. Meteors with Dad or party at the dorm? -Go. -You sure? Positive. I'll text when I get there. -Two hours, no traffic. -Don't forget... I know, drive slow, hands on the wheel, 2:00, 10:00. I was going to say, don't forget to have a good time. I love you, Dad. I love you, too. C'mon, let me walk you to your car. You and that channel-lock. Oh... I'm so sorry. Hey... Well... no bodily injuries this time. Maybe I could check. What are you... what are you doing here? I thought we might watch the meteors. And I was wondering if you might need a tenant. You mean a locum tenant? Actually, I'm not just looking for a place to stay. I'm looking for a place to call home. You really missed that VCR, huh? Yeah. And you. I think you just stopped my heart. That's okay. I can restart it for you. ♪ ...Oh, what fun it is to ride on a one-horse, open sleigh ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride on a one-horse, open sleigh ♪ Hey.
