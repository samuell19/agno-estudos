-Hey, Mom, your book. -Come on, William. That's us! CHRISTMAS KILLS ME Ma'am, where are the toilet's, please? I don't know. FOR SALE Damn winter! THANKS FOR EVERYTHING Hey! No, no. If I hear a word during the interview, you'll get dishcloths for Christmas, OK? She's married to Minister Pierre Mercier and she's sister to Christine C, who gave us the hit we just heard, "Thanks For Everything," but, above all, she's the author of a great blog called My Life's Killing Me. Our guest today is Marianne Cyr, who'll be giving us some news about Modern Mother, her alter ego, and she's here with her two adorable devils, who we love to read about on her blog, where they're known as Destroyer and Kamikaze. -Hello, Marianne. -Hello. With a politician husband, two young kids at home, -your blog, your voluntary work... -Right. ...and the launch of your third book, Christmas Kills Me, how do you find time for yourself? It's quite simple: I don't. Right. She has a nanny, a cleaning lady, a personal trainer, a husband and a shrink. It would be amazing if she was short of time. Sorry. Where was I? Do you want a hand? I know how to count. Are you Charlotte Cantin, who everyone's talking about? Cardin? Charlotte Cardin? -That's right, Cardin. -No, I'm Christine C. -C? -It stands for Cyr. -I'm Christine Cyr. -Ah. -Are you an actress? -No, I'm a singer. -Ah! -I just sang for you. Yes, 10, 20, 25. "I am your father." Er... excuse me... Hello? You didn't call back. I left loads of messages. I'll have to block you, Bruno. I said stop calling. I have to see you. I'm going crazy. I don't know what else to say. -No, don't take your coat off. -I'm hot. -I love you. -Is that Dad? No, it's not, and put that down. It's fragile. I want to see you. I just want to talk. No, I can't. Anyway, it wouldn't be a good idea. An hour, Marianne. Just an hour. Bruno, let time do its job. I'm dying. You're not dying. People don't die of this. Is there someone else? That's it! There's someone else! Yes, there is. I'm married. -I have to go. -No, wait. Just an hour, Marianne, please. I'm going crazy. I can't sleep. I can't get you off my mind. I want to see you. Wednesday, 10:00 a.m. Half an hour. And this is the last time. Ludo! Yes, at our café? No, it's not "our" café. It's "a" café. I have to go now. What are you doing there? I mean, really! MOTEL RECEPTION ROOM Hello? Élyse Laberge? Yes, that's me. Jean-Paul Cyr. I'd like to meet up, to offer... How much would you pay for information about your ex-husband? Meaning? I think I know where he is. I have photos of him, lots of photos. Ah, at last. -Dad! -Hey, big guy! -Dad! -Did you have a nice day? -Yes. -Yes. I hate Christmas. -Shall I get you a drink? -Just one? -Stop, stop, stop! -Sharing is caring. Oh no, don't do this. No, not here, please. No, no, no. Another ten days of damn Christmas magic. I hope it goes fast. I just hate it so much. As you're in a good mood, I'll take the opportunity to say that my kids asked if their mom could come this year. -This year? -Yes. Hasn't your ex been coming for five years now? Family's always welcome, Marianne. And the boys would like to see their aunt. My sister's still sulking. You haven't spoken in a year. It'd be a nice gesture. After the scene she made last year, she should be the one apologizing. What? If I remember rightly, you were a part of that. I remember that spilled wine. It was an accident. OK, so we missed her launch, but she's reacting like... like I invented cancer. She and her boyfriend sunk everything into releasing a record. It means a lot to her. Didn't I say it'd ruin her? One of her tunes was a hit. Why isn't your ex spending Christmas with her new boyfriend? He left her. I imagine she's depressed... and probably angry. Great. Then let's invite her. Three days won't be that bad. Hello. We'd like to talk to Marianne Cyr. Marianne. It's about your father, I think. Yes? Thanks again. I didn't know who to call. No problem. I'll take you home. And we'll have the car scrapped tomorrow. Scrapped? My car? No, I need it. Christine, your car's 18 years old. I know it's hard, but it's time to say goodbye. No, I've got shows to do everywhere during the vacation. What am I supposed to do? I'll lend you mine. Why did I leave you again? Which time? The last one. -Do you want the long version? -No, definitely not. -Do you need help? -No, I'm fine. Phew! Let me show you the industrial park. What are you doing here again? A show, at a dealership. Even though it was really kind of you to come to get me, you're not coming up to my place. I don't need to come up. We could do it in the car. It was a joke. Marianne? Couldn't you answer your damn phone once in a while? Well, it's been nice to see you. A year goes much too fast. Bye! Come on. -No, it's... -What? -Dad's dead. -Dead? What do you mean, dead? Dead, as in "dead." How many ways are there of being dead? -Who's dead? Hi. -Hi, Olivier. So, you're still together? No, we weren't together, but then we came back... No, we're not together anymore. She called me because her car broke down. I had mine. He just came to fix my car. Some things never change. -Who's dead? -Her father. How old are you? He's your dad, too. -Don't expect me to cry. -He doesn't. He's dead. Thanks for coming, but as you can see, we're busy. OK, I'm sorry... I'm a bit stressed. -I'll start over. -She's stressed. Dad's dead. He died here, in Quebec. They found him, collapsed, in a motel room. Wasn't he in Panama, for winter? -No idea. -Why was he in a motel? It'll be hard to ask him. Get your diary. There's a lot to do. The morgue, the funeral parlor, his house needs selling and so on. I'd like it done in three days, tops. I haven't started planning Christmas. That's so like him! He never calls, he disappears and then... whack! With no warning. He had a heart attack. He didn't choose the time. -I'll get going. -No. No, no, I'll go. Yes, that's him. His face looks a bit messed up for someone that had a heart attack. Those injuries were from before the stroke. They're unrelated, apparently. Stroke... Are we supposed to say something? Take all the time you need. For me, that's... Yeah, that's all in order for me, too. -Look at his phone. -What are you doing? Don't look. That's his private life. What private life? He's dead. That's none of your business. I inherited half of his business. I'm looking at my half. You do what you like with yours. -Is that OK? -OK. -What's that? -So you're interested now? They're photos of people we don't know. You were supposed to sort this, fast. I'm sick of paying. Do you think I'm slacking? I want this to be over, too. I need to go Christmas shopping. My wife's on my back, non-stop. You should have got it first time. He surprised me. What can I say? You break in, and he surprises you! You're really good. Where is the old fool? I don't know. If he manages to talk to my ex-wife, you'll be in as much shit as me. You'll be an accomplice. That means jail. I said I'd take care of it, and I will! I just need to find him first. -Poor guy. -That's right. I checked my diary, and I may have time between Christmas and New Year to organize something for Dad. It'd have to be at the chalet, because we'll all be there. Why do you want to do something? I don't know, to... -To honor his... -To honor what? How he never took care of us? How he moved us five times a year when we were kids? How he went off partying and forgot all about us? How he visited our dying mother with his 23-year-old girlfriend? He's still our dad. His last call was to ask me to write a hit for his girlfriend - Latin America's future Céline Dion, it seems. Do you want to keep his ashes? No. I don't want any corpse dust in my house. Then we'll leave them here. We'll rent some space for him. My condolences, ladies. How much is urn storage? There's a whole range of prices. They're all in the brochure. $5,000? $5,000, to store an urn? If you want it at eye level, yes. But there are cheaper options. You'd have to check the deceased's wishes. He wanted to be near where he was born. No, no, no. I'm not going to the Magdalen Islands. I'm just answering his question. The flight costs $700. You don't have to cry, but show some respect! I'd have given his body to science. He'd have helped out, for once. So you won't need to see the urn catalog? That won't be necessary. Er, ladies? We won't stay long. We'll take a quick look and call the agent. I don't have time for this. -Right, your life is killing you. -I'm sorry? I know you're angry with me, for reasons that will interest a therapist of your choice, but could we just straighten this out? That's right! You have no idea why I'm angry. Could we sign a truce? -Yes. -Thanks. Get out of the way. It wasn't locked. Is there anyone here? My God. I don't like this at all. Fuck! What's going on here? Marianne! Be careful! -I'm calling the police. -No, no. No, you're not calling anyone. Do you want the police involved? Look, I know you've got a book launch and Pierre's standing for reelection in spring, but that's blood. OK, go ahead, call the police. Er, no, wait. We'd be legally obliged to declare any criminal activity in a house for sale. Wouldn't you like half of that money, fast? OK. We'll clean up, sell the place, split the money, and it'll be done. It doesn't have to be any harder than that. I'm going to call. FOR SALE Hello? Hello? What does she want? Oh no. Yes? I just wanted to say, your coat's caught in the door. -Ah! -It'll get soaked, in the snow. -Thanks. -OK. Are you the owner? No, it's my father's house. Are you interested? -Maybe? -Really? -Can I talk to him? -Talk to my dad? No, he's not available. But I'm handling the house sale. I can't show it to you now. We need to do a few repairs, but I can leave you my number, then we can talk, before I give it to an agent. Ah, yes, that's a good idea. Yes, because with an agent... it's all business. Here you go. Thanks. Where is that idiot? -I called Olivier. -Yes. He'll come to repair the door. -What? -No, nothing. -Tell me. -No, no. You've just got a funny way of not being together. We don't have to fight non-stop, just because we split. -Answer. -No, you get it. Go on. -Hello? -Hello. Could I talk to Jean-Paul? He's not available. Can I take a message? Could you tell him that Élyse is trying to reach him? I have what he asked for. OK, can you leave me your number? He already has it. Thanks. She's so stupid. Oh no. I WILL WAIT FOR YOU AT YOUR HOME. LOVE YOU. I can't believe it. Oh no, fuck! Where are you going? What's she doing? FOR SALE -Pierre? -Hello! You should see my dad's place. It's a total mess. -Are the boys here? -My daughter took them to the movies. One of your colleagues is here, I think. OK. Hi. I got worried when you didn't show up. You're never late. -Something unexpected came up. -Yes. I couldn't get through on your phone, so I came over. Your husband told me about your dad. -I'm so sorry. -Yes. I should've called. It totally slipped my mind. But the last two days have been so busy, -with the house and so on. -Do you work together? -Yes. -No. I mean yes, we work together, at the publishing house, but not directly. He's a contractor, for my publisher. -For her novel. -Her collection. Yes, that's what he meant. What exactly do you do? Don't answer for him. OK. -I'm a consultant. -Yes. Yes. So if I call your publisher and ask to speak to Bruno, a secretary will know who I mean and take a message? Tell him, Marianne. Shut up! -What? -I'm sick of hiding. I love Marianne. We're crazy about each other. We want to live together. It's over, Pierre, OK? I swear, it's over. We didn't mean to hurt you. It just happened. -We're in love. -No, it was nothing. It's been over for weeks. OK. I'll tell the boys that you're staying in town, to organize your father's funeral. We'll talk to them after the vacation. I'm going to get the boys. When I get back, I'd like you to be gone. -And don't let him hang around. -Where do you want me to go? I'll leave that to you. No, Pierre, I want to talk. Let him go, darling. I'll look after you. -My roommate's with his family... -Leave me alone! Marianne, please, wait. What are you doing for Christmas? Er... why? We said that if neither of us had plans... Actually, I do have plans. You do? Can I come along, too? I've got nothing. Is that OK? It'd be complicated. Ah, you're going with someone. I'm staying with her family. Is it serious? It could get serious. Well, congratulations. -I didn't know that... -Yes. Beautiful, refined, smart, she's got it all. Yes, all of that. And I suppose she wants children. -Were you with her, the other night? -It's been three months. -And about the other night... -The other night? Thanks. Three months? Yes, I didn't know how to tell you. I wouldn't have made a scene. I know you wouldn't have. -That's not your style. -But? Let's just say you tend to find me cuter when I'm not available. She doesn't know how lucky she is. I don't know. -When you had a chance... -Yes, but I... I specialize in heading in the opposition direction to anything like success or happiness. -I'm going to go, OK? -Yes. Hi, Marianne. I'll take Dad's ashes to the islands. Huh? What? Pierre's going away with our kids, his kids and his ex. Is his ex coming for Christmas again? I can't watch her drain our bar or listen to her insinuations about how I wrecked her family. I'd rather spend it with a dead man's ashes. Is that decoration for the house, or are we going to drink it? -Chris... -What? What is it? -How much do you think that is? -A lot. Don't touch! We can't keep it. It's bound to be dirty. Jean-Paul would be helping us out, for once. What are you going to do? Spend it a bill at a time? You can't bank a load of unidentified cash. I have $68.97 in my account. And I need a filling. I'm still in debt from the production of my album, and while you'll be in Martinique with your perfect family, I'll be singing at the Ascension Curling Club's New Year's party! So, yes, to answer your question, I'm going to keep that money. Here, lock the door. Wait! -I'll come to the islands. -What? -Yes. -You wanted to donate his body. If I have to sing "White Christmas" at one more office party, I'll kill myself. Can I just stop by at my place for two minutes -to pick up a few pairs of underwear? -No. OK. But will you wait for me? What's going on? They're leaving the house, with the guy's stuff. -Where are they going? -No idea. They didn't call and say, "Réjean, we're going bowling, and then we're going to see Dad." They didn't tell me. Hey, Réjean, don't get smart with me. One of them's in the car. The other one has two bags. -And a guitar. -What do you mean? -What sort of guitar? -I don't know what sort of guitar. It's just a guitar. A ukulele. Or a guitar. What does she want with a ukulele? Hey, I'm not into music. OK, OK. Open up! Follow them. And stick close! OK. That's what I'll do. Ah, my darling Cosita. LOCATION Who do you think they are? -Friends of Dad's. I don't know. -No. People don't usually photograph their friends with... What's it called? A telephoto lens. A telephoto lens is more for photographing people from afar, like the paparazzi. Maybe they're local stars. I have no idea. Do you think they're part of what happened? I'm going to scatter my father's ashes. You play detective, if you want. What? -Be careful! -Sorry. Is that really necessary? -Can I put the stereo on? -I have a headache. What are you doing? It's cold! Close the window, please. You heat this car like it's an old people's home. Then take your coat off. Really? You know, I've missed our closeness. -I don't suppose... -No, thank you. I don't suppose. That you want to share. I can't hear you anymore. -Hello! -Stop it. It looks like they're heading to Bas-Saint-Laurent. Does your guy have a house there? How would I know? The guy's blackmailing me. We don't do foursomes. Find him, before he drops us in deep shit. Hey, listen, I'm not Columbo. You're certainly not Columbo. He didn't have a moustache. I know Columbo didn't have a moustache. That's not what I'm saying. I'll have a chicken sandwich. And then, I'm not sure whether to have fries or gratin. No, fries, please. I think I know your face. That's possible. Did you sing "Thanks for Everything"? -Yes. -Ah! I knew it was you. I identified with that song so much. It must be great, being friends with a star. -No, she's my sister. -Ah, you must be so proud of her. It's borderline unbearable. Right! You should release some new songs soon. It's been a while. Well, I released an album last year. Right, eight songs in a year. You're lucky you're not paid by the hour! Don't overdo it. My God. There we go. Oh fuck! -There you go. -Thanks. -Let's get out of here, fast! -What's up? Come on! My hot chicken! I'm hungry. Come on! -Is everything OK? -I'm sorry, we have to cancel. My sister's having a breakdown. -Have a nice day. -Bye. "The door's not open!" What are those two like? Here we go. LOCATION How much money do you think that is? I don't know. And I don't want to talk about it. I have enough problems without thinking of JP's. You're a bundle of laughs. What? We can't listen to the radio, we can't open the windows, we can't look at photos, we can't talk. -We can't know what's going on. -OK, I'm sorry. It's just... I saw someone I don't want to see. -At the gas station? -Yes. Who? He's called "someone I don't want to see." So is it someone you work with? Is it a man? Is it a woman? It's no good, anyway. The window! Do you have a napkin? Wipe them on your coat. Hey! I could've had an accident! You're crazy! This car cost a fortune! -You think you're funny. -Yes. What is it? Did someone insult you, on your blog? Is it a guy that works for the mafia? What side do you want? One of Pierre's political enemies with state secrets about tourism in Gaspesia? OK, I'll take this side. -What is it? -These sheets weren't changed. -I can't sleep here. -Don't be such a princess. No, I'm not sleeping in a stranger's pubic hairs. That's disgusting. Excuse me. Can I help you? No. Bye. What are you doing here? I'm going to ask you, with the utmost respect, to get lost, if that's OK. Are you a friend of Marianne's? Is that it? Who are you? My name isn't important. Nor is the rest of you. So, bye. -That's not your car. -Is it yours? -No, but... -No, it's not. Get lost. OK, then I'll have to call the police. I'll have to rearrange your face. Unbelievable. What do you think you're doing? Sir? Sir, are you all right? No, no! What's going on? Don't panic, but the guy I saw at the diner on Route 20 is outside. We have to go. Marianne, who is this guy? -Pack up. -Are you sure it's the same guy? No, we're leaving because I want to talk! I'll play along, but you owe me an explanation. -Get in the car! -Did you try to talk to him? -I can't. He's armed. -What? Shit! 911. Can I help you? Yes, I'm at the Shédiac Motel. An armed man is following me. He's in a rental car, with curly hair. Get a move on, fast! Quick! Ah! Too much? -Who have you turned into? -What? If you want them to come fast, you have to overdo it. -Hello. -Hello. Get down on the ground! Hands above your head! -Don't move! -I'm not resisting! Thanks. -Can you put some music on? -Yes. Do you like that? I never liked that song. OK, no problem. That's good. You always liked old-fashioned songs. No! -That's really popular. -Right. Stop with that. My kids don't like me smoking. Ah, I found a house. Havre-aux-Maisons, two bedrooms, two bathrooms. -Book it. -There's one in Pointe-Basse, too. I don't care, Christine. Just book anything. I'm going to use your credit card. He's not giving his Airbnb. You've got a fortune in the trunk. Book anything. You're in a bad mood, but call your husband if you want a fight. The guy... is someone I had an affair with. An affair? -You? -What? You don't run a monopoly. My parents were weirdos, too. You don't often lay claim to that heritage. I thought you were fine. -Judging from your blog... -We are doing fine. Pierre's perfect. Our life is perfect. I'm the problem. I'm never satisfied with anything. Who's the guy? A server in a café, where I write sometimes. It's OK, you can start. Your opinion couldn't be worse than mine. I'm the last person that would be judging you. Olivier has got a girlfriend. -He has a girlfriend? -Yes. OK, so the other day, at your place, was basically... -That's what I meant. -Right. I'd be the last person to judge you. -Has it been going on long? -No. No, it hasn't been going on long or that often. Four months. Maybe five. Or seven, actually. But I tried to finish it, four months ago. OK. Sometimes, I listen to myself, blogging about nonsense like, "the benefits of clean, well-folded laundry" and I want to stab myself, to see if I can still feel anything. Ow! Where did that come from? You see? You can still feel something. That's good. Really. Throw that away. How old are you? After Christmas last year, I often thought of calling you, but I never did. Yes. I imagine that was easier. You? What about me? Didn't you think about calling? Why would I call? I don't know. To... To apologize for behaving like a spoiled child. For spoiling Christmas and stomping out, like a teenager. For your whole performance. Except maybe the last bit, when you gave Pierre's ex an earful. That look on her face was my best Christmas present. But to be honest, yes, I thought about calling. But you didn't come to the launch of my first album, so I thought we were even. I do have a life, you know. -I know. -The world doesn't turn around you. I never understood why you sunk all your money into that and then did it all your own way. Is it so hard to get on with a producer? No, but all the ones I spoke to wanted to arrange my music. They wanted to change my hair and clothes. They didn't want Olivier to direct. They wanted me to go on talk shows and do radio competitions. That's just not me. -At least I did my own music. -While ruining yourself. What? Happiness and success aren't so dreadful, you know. -You could get used to it. -That's right, Marianne. Tell me about your recent experience of happiness. You don't read my blog, but I don't complain. -I read it. -No, you don't. I see all your photos, being so busy and beautiful, in great places, with your kids and husband. If you read my blog, you'd react to my posts about you. I had nothing to add. I've never posted about you. Well done. You caught me. I don't always read your blog. -You don't read it at all. -What can I say? I don't know that woman. I never recognized you in her. And I looked hard, because I don't see what's so hard about your life. Apart from the boredom. Next time you need a monster for a song, use someone else, OK? -What? -Your song, on the radio. I know it's about me. "I thought I was living with a stone heart, -"Prisoner of your shadow." -Pull over. -What do you mean? -I want to get out. -You're crazy! -Stop the damn car! What are you doing? Christine! ÉLYSE LABERGE DIVORCE 8 YEARS AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HER HUSBAND Give me your keys. Give me your keys. -What? -Give me the car keys. It's the same guy. He's aged, but it's the same guy, right? Yes. OK, wait a sec. "After being found guilty "of a Ponzi fraud worth $107 million, "taking in small-time savers, customers, friends "and his family, "Guy Sauvageau vanished from the radar. "Élyse Laberge, his wife and partner at the time, "was caught up "and tried to move on and start a new life." OK, so if I've got this right, Sauvageau ran away and left all his problems for his wife. The police have been hunting him for years. Did Dad meet him in Panama? He found a way of making some money, by blackmailing him. Hence the cash in the freezer. Wait... Hang on. That guy was outside Dad's, when I went out for a smoke. -Well, well. -He was. -Are you sure? -Yes, I am. I went to tell him his coat was trapped in the door. He asked about the house. He sounded interested. I gave him my number. Jean-Paul causes trouble, even when he's dead. -...and to the islands. -Yes. You have a nice stay, too. -Marianne. -What? -Her name is Élyse. -Whose? Sauvageau's wife is called Élyse Laberge. Yes, we established that. So? The name on the envelope. -Excuse me. -Yes? I'll have a very strong coffee, please. -OK. -A scotch. What? It's the holiday season. -Coffee. -Thanks. Are you spending Christmas with your family? No, our family left the islands, but our parents were born in Gros-Cap. I thought as much. You're Jean-Paul's daughters. I thought I knew that smile. That's your mother's smile. My wife knew your mother. -Really? -Yes. Normand Langford. -An old friend of your parents. -Christine. -How's your mother? -She died of cancer, 21 years ago. I'm sorry to hear that. She was a good person. And how's Jean-Paul? He died two, three days ago. Ah... To Jean-Paul, who never had problems, other than those of his own making. -To Jean-Paul. -To Jean-Paul. In the past, you could divide the islanders in three categories: people Jean-Paul had borrowed money from, people Jean-Paul had borrowed girls from, and third and most dangerous, his ex-girlfriends. Yes, that sounds like him. His favorite sport back then was to welcome new police officers as they arrived. He'd start off by inviting the guy for a beer. Then, within three hours, he'd have him completely drunk. The next day, the corporal would wake up with the headache of his life, with no money or credit card, wondering where he was. Jean-Paul would call the police and ask them to come to get him. That was Jean-Paul! No, no. I won't let Jean-Paul's daughters pay. No way. Take that back. -Thanks a lot. -To Jean-Paul. FROM PIERRE CONTACT MR. VIENS ABOUT THE DIVORCE There you go. What's up? Are you OK? Look. OK. Let's scatter Jean-Paul here. Right now, in the gulf. What? The middle of nowhere is his natural habitat. We'll get to Cap-aux-Meules then turn back, and you can talk to Pierre. Maybe you can work it out, Marianne. I don't know. You'll have a better chance than if you stay here. I'll take you home. I'll stay in the car, just in case, OK? -I'll go to get Dad. -Yes, OK. Thanks. It's that one there. That's kind of you. -Those aren't the ashes. -He's here! -He's here, on board. -Who? That guy's here. -OK, calm down. -I am calm. I am calm. -What guy? Where? -In the trunk of my car. What are you telling me? I'm telling you he's in my trunk. -What guy? Your lover? -No, not my lover. The guy! How many guys are chasing you? The guy outside Dad's, the one who asked about the house. He's in my trunk! How many scotches did you have? Don't you believe me? Then take a look. This doesn't make any sense. Who'd have put him there? How would I know? We need to get rid of him. Yes, we need to get rid of him. Good idea. That's the best idea I've got. We'll throw a 200-pound guy overboard, and no one will notice? Excuse me! I'm brainstorming! OK, let's call the police. What are we going to ask them? To arrest a guy covered in blood for breaking into my trunk? That's the truth! I don't want it to affect Pierre. He's running in spring. OK, come on. My little baby. -Hello? -Where are you? -I don't know. -What do you mean, you don't know? I'm supposed to be at my mother-in-law's, making pâté. My wife is going to kill me. Forget about the pâté, OK? Where's the old guy? Take care of your own damn business if you're not happy. I tell you, my expenses are going up, OK? OK? Unbelievable. When is that guy going to stop busting my balls? We didn't do anything wrong. It can't be that hard to prove. And how do we explain the half million that you took? Was he alive? Yes, I think so. -Good. -Good? What's good about it? You get less time for kidnapping than for murder. You kept that to yourselves! I didn't make the link, at first. But I called my wife to say that I just served Jean-Paul's and Anita's daughters. She told me that Anita's daughter sings "Thanks for Everything." -Yes, that's her. -That's me. My daughter spent a whole summer singing that song. I'm sorry. -I'll give you my number. -Ah, thanks. My wife would be so happy if you stopped by. -Why not? -Yes, we could do that. While we're in the islands. GET ME OUT OF YOUR DAMN CAR! Fuck! Look! What do I do? Do I call him? Yes. Yes, call him. Hello. Come and open your trunk. Where am I? Where are you taking me? We're not. We didn't know you were there. -Ask what he's doing. -What are you doing in my trunk? I'll tell you, if you get me out. We can't access our cars during the crossing. We'll be in Cap-aux-Meules in two hours. Oh my God! The damn Magdalen Islands. OK, there are two things that could happen now. Either you find a way of getting me out or I'll call the police, and I'll tell them why I'm here. -He's calling the police. -He's bluffing. -Yeah? -He'd already have called. -He doesn't want to, or he can't. -He sounds serious. If you call the police, we'll give them photos of you and Guy Sauvageau. Tell him he'll be out when we arrive. We don't want any trouble. We'll let you out when we arrive. We'll have the photos ready to send to the police, until we're sure of our safety. I need a scotch. Stick your Christmas up your ass. Damn shitty Christmas. You don't understand. The woman I love is in danger. And you're saying that this woman is married to the Minister of the Environment. -No, the Minister of Tourism. -Of Tourism? And you were following her to New Brunswick, to propose? Yes. She's... the love of my life. Does the minister's wife know she's the love of your life? Sir, there's an armed man in the trunk of her car. I know. I put him there. And you want us to protect her from the armed man you put in her trunk, whose weapon you were found with. When you put it like that, I know I must seem crazy. And who is the guy that you locked in the minster's wife's trunk? I thought he was her lover, at first. But... now, I'm not so sure. You said I could make a phone call. Don't pull that face. You look like you're coming through with 10kg of coke. Sorry, I'm not used to transporting bodies. Why are you laughing? Do you think now's the time? I'm not laughing. Sir? Once we disembark and get out of the port, we'll find a quiet spot and get you out of the trunk. Stop laughing! I'm sorry. Is that guy coming over? Fuck! -Hello. -Hello. The New Brunswick police called. It's about a clandestine passenger. I'll have to check your trunk. Marianne Cyr. I'm married to Minister Mercier. My sister and I came to scatter our father's ashes. He's from here. There's no one in our trunk. Pull over next to my car, please. -Yes. -Thanks. Let me do the talking. -What are you doing to say? -No idea. Sorry to trouble you, but we had a report, so we had to check. Welcome to the islands. Happy holidays. -I'm sorry about your father. -That's kind of you. Marianne, was that for real? I saw him. I'm not crazy. -I don't get it. He was there. -Oh no! Shit! What's up? He took the money. Is that what's worrying you? The money? We have to call the police now. -To say what? -The truth. What truth, exactly? We came to scatter our dad's ashes where he was born, and on the way, we realized there was a stranger in the trunk. A wounded stranger. We don't know how he got there. And he took all the money from our dad's fridge. No, you're right. That won't work. OK, then we'll tell them the truth, but we'll leave a few bits out. We'll tell the police that a man threatened us. Without telling anyone on the ferry or the guy that searched the trunk, but we want to talk about it now? Crime is so complicated. Yes! Shit. What's up? The next boat's in two days. We haven't been introduced. I could break her arm, any time. It would be easy. Put your knick-knacks down. Put the bird down. What do you want? You stole our money. We want it back. Could you not bother the criminal? I'd like to be above material concerns, but I don't have a cent. This isn't the time to plan a financial recovery. Stop! I've had enough of your shitty superiority. Money's less of a worry when your husband takes care of you than when you have work. Pierre and I are a family. I hope I'm not interrupting your argument. When's Jean-Paul coming? I need to talk to him, right now. Not tomorrow. Jean-Paul Cyr? -Where the hell is he? -He's dead. Dead? What do you mean? I saw him, five days ago. It doesn't always take long to die. You're pulling my leg! No, no, he's right here. This is him. I can't believe it. Oh my God. I chase him for a week, and the guy dies. Looking on the bright side, you won't be chasing him anymore. But I won't get paid. You can console yourself with the tidy sum you stole from us. And you won't be charged with murder. That's another advantage. We can split the money. You'll be buying our silence, as we'll be accomplices. Really, Christine? We want to send our father off and go home. This has nothing to do with us. Except that you saw me and you have those photos. We have a minor PR problem. We'll keep quiet. You'll never hear of us again. That's what your dad said, but he hung around for more. You don't know us. Silence is our family specialty. We didn't talk for a year. The bigger the deal, the less we talk. OK. OK. Let's take a walk, out on the clifftops. Move it... before I get my gun out. Move it. You're hurting me! Dad hid some money, and I know where it is. We can split it. Don't try to fool me. Just move. Don't hurt her! Get in front of us, where I can see you. Marianne, it's true. I was nasty last Christmas. It's Christmas. It brings out the worst in me. Stop it. I should be apologizing. I should've come to your launch. I know it was important to you. No, you were so busy. I'm not four years old. I should've seen that. Could you two stop talking? Just shut up. Let's go! Who's that? Answer it! It's my husband. Can I take it? Do you think I'm stupid? No, but we had a falling out. -I can't leave like this. -No, no. -It's Christmas. -Like I don't know. Please, let us talk. -It's Christmas! -Move! Just for a minute. Can't a mother say goodbye to the father of her children? -No! Move it! -Don't you have family? I can't believe we'll be dead, like JP. -I love you, Marianne. -I love you, too. Don't jump, Christine! Make a run for it! I won't let him kill you! Shut your mouth, or you'll be jumping first. You got him. But I wasn't aiming for his head. He really doesn't look well. -Take his pulse. -Why me? You're good at that stuff. Do it. Go! -Is he dead? -I don't know. What are you doing? -Oh my God. -What's up? His name is Réjean Sauvageau. They've got the same surname. Fuck! Where are you going? Where are you going? I'll be back! I'm going to look for his car! Careful, we don't want him to die! He's not helping much. OK, that's good. Wait a second. No! Are you going to answer your phone? It's Pierre. -Hello? -Are you OK? -Where are you? -On the island, with my sister. The islands? Yes, we came to scatter our father's ashes. Pierre... could we just talk? Marianne, I got a call from the New Brunswick police. Oh no! Your boyfriend was entitled to make a phone call, and he called me. Imagine my joy. What did he want? He wasn't all that coherent. From what I understood, you're being pursued by a criminal that he put in your trunk. We weren't together, OK? Marianne, should I be worried? No, everything's under control. OK. So you're both OK? Yes, we'll catch the first ferry and come back to town. Could we just... if we could just... I don't know, could we talk? The boys want to say something. I'll put them on. Here, it's Mom. Mommy! Hello, darling. We bought your present, but it's a secret. We went to see Santa Claus, and when I sat on his knee, he farted. It's true, I heard him. When are you coming back? -Soon. -I miss you. Me too. A lot. I miss you a lot, too. Bye-bye. I love you. Goodbye, boys. Hey... Are you OK? What do we do with him? Come on, I have an idea. Yes, the bag of money's there. What's going on? Where am I? Oh my God! You're truly your father's daughters. I think that your bandit will remember his trip to the islands. It's JP. What's JP? My song. It's about JP. Everything all right, girls? Darling? Darling, come here. UNKNOWN CALLER THE STAR FAIRIES WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS MILLIONAIRE ARRESTED FOR FRAUD Merry Christmas, Piggy. Shall we do it here? Yes, this'll do. What do I do? Open the box and throw it out? -Maybe we could say a few words. -OK. JP? Jean-Paul? Dad, maybe. Whatever feels best. Goodbye. No grudges? OK, seriously. Thanks. You go ahead. Well... From a purely biological perspective, he did give us life. Given where we came from, we both did well not to be locked up. -OK, let's do this before I freeze. -Yes. JP. Dad. Thanks for the genes, though they can be hard to manage. Thanks for bringing us both together. Thanks for everything. -It's everywhere. -Dad's in my eyes. -What? -I've got Dad in my eyes. There's no way of getting rid of him! Robert Gillan Subtitling: Hiventy
