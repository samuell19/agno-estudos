[INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DOOR BELL] [CONTINUES TO RING...] Hello sir Good morning You're required at the association office, immediately. Mr. Kumar has sent the word. What's the matter? I don't know, sir. I was only told to bring you. OK. Hold on. OK sir, be quick. Shruthi? Where are my pants? Who is at the door? It's a call from the association. Where are the pants? At this hour? Why? Argh... I don't know Shruthi. where is my pants? I don't know. Must have put it for wash. Mr. Vijay Kumar... After the Asiad Games, a report from Singaporehas come. It says you've consumed banned substance. We'll give you the details in the next meeting. You will have to return your medal. You're not allowed to participate in the coming matches and events. We've submitted the reports to the media. Soon... The news will be out. [CROWD CHEERING] [BELL DINGS] Stop. Won't you say something? There's nothing much to say. Just remember you're representing your country. Red Blue Box! [BOXERS GRUNTING] One... Two... Three... Four... [CROWD APPLAUDING] The winner in the Blue Corner from India-Vijay Kumar. Vijay? Vijay Kumar... According to the blood report sent by the Games officials, hydrochlorothiazide has been detected. The presence of this drug... Holds an assumption that you could've taken steroids. I didn't take steroids. Hydrochlorothiazide is taken to remove steroid traces in the blood. I've nothing to do with all this. You've stated the same in your statement as well. You're aware of the enormity of the allegation, right? Let's go by what you're saying is true... We know about the clashes between Gowda and you... Raj, go on punching. Defend Jai. Defend Jai. Jai, defend. Keep moving. Take your time. Don't rush. Are you listening? Jai defend. You need to defend, Jai. Leave the aggression. You must only defend, Jai. Defend, Jai. Jai, defend. [BOXERS GRUNTING] Don't you understand by defend? Are you even listening to me? Am I talking to a *******? Sir? Sir? Shall I try? Who are you? Vijay Kumar Not your name. Why should I let you in the ring? I won the State finals. The State finals? So? Jai lost to you? Indeed. Should've mentioned before? So... You're here... Since when? About a month. What are your future plans? To become India's best boxer. Vijay Kumar! I'll give you 40 seconds. 40 seconds? To lose. Six points. I won't give away six points in 40 secs. Raj. You'll lose you first point with his simple jab. That will hurt your patience, not your strength. You impatience will lead you to lose the next point. Before you understand how you lost the second point... There would be a second punch against you. There are only two points left. You will start to panic. That's it. Another jab across your face. Now you'll get into a defense mode. To bring you out of the mode, he will need just five seconds. As soon as you come out of it... Another point. Total six points. 36 seconds. Don't come to me with your arrogance. Tell me why I should spend time on you. Raj! Pad up. We are recording this interrogation for the committee's documentation. Why are you interrogating me? Vijay Kumar has mentioned your name in his statement. I know what that ****** would've told. Tell me why have you called for me. You're the head coach and... You're responsible for your boxer. If you bring in anyone and everyone, I can't take the responsibility. He has consumed drugs in Asiad drugs and is now caught. Instead of throwing him out, you're interrogating me. - If I was the president... - [INTERRUPTS] But you're not. You're the head-coach. I'm the president of the association. I respect your position. And I expect the same from you. When Vijay Kumar came here after wining the State competition. How was his first impression? Like any other boxer. Young blood. He was under the assumption that he knew well. Arrogance was definitely there And still within a year, he becomes India's best boxers. That was possible under my training, Kumar. I was the one who taught him boxing. Without proper training and discipline... It's not possible to get to that level. But initially, you didn't agree to train him. In fact... When he wrote to the higher authorities about your training, we are aware of what had happened. Sit. Eat. Done? Yes, sir. Okay, come. Last time how many seconds did I give you to lose 6 points? 40 seconds. 20 seconds this time. Jai! C'mon hit. Hit. What are you staring at? Go on and hit. C'mon. What have you achieved... that you've written a letter to the association, that my training is bad? The association doesn't control me. I've given them good boxers. That's why I'm here. This isn't for you. Leave, right away. Don't waste my time. Good morning, Sai Co-operative Bank. Tell me, sir? Yes, sir. You can come. Madam? Yes, tell me. I need to open an account. Occupation? Boxer. Sportsmen. Fill in as boxer. Like Rocky. You haven't watched Rocky? It's very good. Story of a boxer. He faces a lot of challenges and struggles. And still proves he's a great boxer. Do I look similar? Not like that... I watched this film when I was little. I would call anyone who fought well, Rocky. I'm not a good boxer. I couldn't last in the ring for even 40 seconds. I've taken more time to fill your form. Here. Give it there. Tell them if you have any investments or insurance. Thank you. And, watch Rocky. Sound from TV/ROCK movie dialogues Gowda tried hard to put me out. He didn't like my presence at all. Because... His student Jai had lost to me in the State finals. Even I knew about all of this. But... After watching Rocky I was determined to fight. Although I wanted to quit. I didn't. I would hear Gowda teach others. The exhibition match was nearing. I was prepping for it. Before hitting the others... Learn to get hit. They will hit. It will hurt. But that's only to the body. Not the mind.

Round one for the afternoon Red corner Rohit vs Chandan Blue corner [CROWD CHEERING] Round two for the afternoon Blue corner Vijay vs Sandeep red corner. He's the one. Who? The one you had a tiff with you. I have a tiff with everyone. Red Blue Box. [CROWD CHEERING] He's good. He's good, isn't he? He has a good future. Definitely. His foot work is also good. You were good. If he gets good training, definitely... We can consider. Round three for the afternoon Blue corner Vijay vs Akash Red corner You are well aware it's impossible to win over a higher weight category. Boxing is not just about fighting, Shetty. Understanding the opponent is equally important. [BOXERS HISSING AND GRUNTING] [CROWD CHEERING] [BELL DINGS] Sir is testing you. [BELL DINGS TWICE] [CROWD CHEERING] I think he heard you. I was waiting for it too. One punch that will shock the opponent. Using that at the right time... I wanted to see this. {Gestures to stop} Losing and winning wasn't important to me. He proved I was wrong about him. I was happy. He needed training to know things. Had I simply accepted him... His pride would've outdone him. He would've probably gone up till the national level. But his capacity... Was much more than that. He had to learn to use his strength and technique in the right manner. As it went on, he learned things quickly. And then... State finals... Gold. Nationals, Gold. SAF, Gold. Hand this over to him. Okay, madam. Hi. Yes, tell me? Don't you recognise me? No, sorry. I was here to open an account. Is there a problem with it? - There's no problem. - Then, loan? - No... - Insurance? - Deposit? - What I'm saying is... Then? I wanted to say thanks. Thanks for? Sir, a lot of customers are waiting... And it's lunch time. So please. The last time I was here, I told you I'm a boxer and you told me watch the film Rocky. Sir... Come. How long did you survive in the ring this time? As long as a national level boxer should. That means? That means, I'm fighting for India. Congratulations. Life insurance? There's time for that. What will you give me? Whatever you ask for. Yeah... Tell me a joke. A joke? Yes, a joke. I don't know any. Just one? You ask what I want and now you're not sure of it. Are all boxers the same? Two people are traveling in a train... One of them jumps off the train. Okay? What does the other person say to this? What? What an idiot. He jumped off without a parachute. I hope your boxing skills are better than your jokes. If we keep talking like this, I'll lose my job. Sorry, I'll leave. It's lunch break in 10 minutes. Okay, I'll leave.

I smacked him, right? Learn to respect your opponents. He was drained out, sir. And so were you, Vijay. Had he held on... You would've lost. But I won. I'm aware, Vijay. First, learn to follow my instructions. Or, you can leave. Well done, Vijay. What's up, Gowda? How're you, Shetty? The boy is good. Shetty... We are talking here... so please... See you, later. You guys don't get along? There's nothing to get along. Sorry Vijay. I got late. That's okay. - There was traffic on the way. - Order, sir? Have you ordered? I'm fine, sir. I've had lunch. - Sure? - Yes. Two cups of coffee. Okay, sir. Everyone is talking high of you. So, I invited you to congratulate. Thank you, sir. How does it feel? Good. What's going on now? The usual, sir. Practicing. National Games is nearing. Yes, sir. After that, the Asiad Games. And then? The World Championship. And then? I'm not sure, sir. I've to think of it. Just thinking won't help. Just punching without thinking will not lead him anywhere. His footwork is good. Ram will win. You think you learnt a lot in a short period? What did Shetty say? I met him because he forced me to. He said he'll make you a big boxer... And you can make a lot of money, right? What did you say to it? I refused. - You didn't want to, yourself or... - I didn't want it. I told you not to meet him and hangout with him, right? Then why did you meet him? Tell me. Sir... Speak up. Why did you meet? You didn't understand my words or you don't value it? All idiots. I had told you not to meet him, right? - Yes sir, but... - What but? - Sir... - Why are you stammering... Speak up, you ******. You're my coach. Not father. What? What did you say? I do respect your words. But I like to make my decisions. Hold on. You want to make decisions? Didn't you have anyone to nurture you while growing up? Where are you off to? Wait. What's your story? Didn't you have parents? Did they orphan you or they died? Tell me your story now. - Let's not go there, sir. - Tell me. Tell me, what's your story? Talk. What are you staring at? Talk. Tell me. Speak up, you fool. Speak up. Yes. I didn't have parents. Who are you to ask? You're the coach here and you're paid for it. You need to mind your business. I won't say I wasn't wrong that day. My reaction might've been too rigid. In spite of all this, he met Shetty. I didn't like it. Be with him. Train yourself. But, allow me to handle your brand endorsements. You sign the contract.

He's a demon. He'll suck your blood. Mr. Gowda! Aren't we all the same? Until you found out what a good boxer he is... You didn't like him too. Are you aware of the kind of crook you are? Sir, please... Not now. There's nothing to talk. He's my coach just for namesake. Do not forget, how we got here. Yeah, ok. Careful, Vijay. You've a match. [CROWD CHEERING] [BELL DINGS] What's wrong? Are you sick? Don't lose in the ring. Better to give up. [CROWD CONTINUES TO CHEER] I'm aware it's insulting for a boxer to give up in a match. But, had he continued...

You don't want Pradeep Gowda as your coach? No. He's losing interest these days. He's not coaching well. But you're aware that, he's the best. Then I wouldn't have lost the previous match. I want a different coach. You're asking me why he consumed drugs... It's simple. He was losing. He wasn't in a condition to box. He was drunk all the time. When all the doors to winning are closed... He chose to use drugs to win. I had asked for a different coach. He was aware of that. If the coach was changed, his public image would be tarnished. Why would he sit idle? That's how... He made sure I won't get to participate anymore. You should've told me this yourself. Maybe this was meant to happen. Nothing can be done. Keep holding. You should win, but... Don't take too much pressure. I'm scared I will lose everything in life. The Vijay I knew... Didn't have anything to lose. Vijay Kumar and Pradeep Gowda Since we don't have any evidences based on these sessions... We don't have a clarity. And so, for now we'll have to ban both of you from boxing activities. The ban period is one year. Post that, you can appeal. And once you appeal, we'll decide what has to be done. Thank you. I'll make sure you'll repent on your actions. There's nothing left to ruin.

But, not sure how. I can't do anything about this, Vijay. There should be another option, right? It's been four months. I'm losing my mind. You may have not been a popular boxer... But now... Everyone knows about your drugs case. You know that I didn't take drugs. Shouldn't the other believe it as well? I brought you a long way I made sure you got all the luxuries...

This could be a new beginning. Could be but, right now we're in a tough position. We can do it, Vijay. - We can manage... - We can't, Shruthi. - We can! - I'm saying we can't. What do you plan to do now? I don't know. But for now, this is impossible. This is all you're saying. Because we won't be able to take care. I'm unable to interpret what you're saying Just say what you want to say. Don't try to put this on me, Shruthi. You're not able to say it out, no? Say it, Vijay. Shruthi, we can't afford a child now, opt for an abortion. Say it Vijay. I don't know, Shruthi. I don't know anything. Leave me alone. Do as you please. The same food, all the time. Why can't you try making something else? You didn't get food at the bar? [ECHOES]You didn't get food at the bar? What did you say? What did you say, Shruthi? Shruthi, what was it? - What was it, Shruthi? - Vijay! It hurts. Sorry, Shruthi. I don't know what's wrong with me. But all this is your fault. My fault? Yes. I met Shetty because you told me to. I signed the contract for you. You made me feel small by paying the bills. You're hurting me. Shruthi. I'm tired, Shruthi. I got everything in life. And lost evrything as well. Things were out of my reach. I've lost everything, Shruthi. - Shruthi, I've lost everything. - Vijay... Stop saying things like this. Listen to me. My life's at a standstill. - Vijay... - It's all over, Shruthi. - Calm down, Vijay. - It's all over, Shruthi. - It's over. - Please, listen to me. Just calm down now. You want me to calm down? You've no idea about how I feel. [ECHOES]You've no idea about how I feel. Vijay? Vijay? Am I not suffering along with you, Vijay? Suffering? You look alright. I'm the one suffering. It's me. I'm suffering. Look, look at me. We'll together set everything right. Please Vijay. Listen to me. Please Vijay. - It's all over. - Everything will be fine. - No Shruthi. - Vijay? Didn't I say, it' all over? Nothing can be fixed. Vijay, where are you going? Vijay, wait. She has gone to the hospital. Shruthi. Shruthi? Shruthi? They said I had lost a lot of blood before I could get to the hospital. I shouldn't have lost conscious. [ECHOES]I shouldn't have lost conscious. Whoever got me here at four in the morning... They should've got me here earlier. Not sure if it was a boy or a girl. I've no clue about its features. But in the report now... It'll say miscarriage due to loss of blood. No one will know it was because of you. I should've let you go. If I didn't fall while trying to stop you, I wouldn't be here. From now on, don't come near me Vijay. Go away. Just like you left yesterday. Don't look back. Cheers Superstar... This looks good on you. This is just the beginning. There's more to come. Yes. I know. This is a new beginning for us.

You didn't notice me. Have a seat, Vijay. What can I get you? How're you, Vijay? Fine. How's Shruthi? It was depressing to hear about what happened. Come, sit. Are you aware of what you've done? Are you aware, Gowda? I lost everything. My baby too. I've been grieving about how well I would've been, had you not caused all this. Why did you do it? I'll tell you a story. Listen to it first. There was a boxer. A very good boxer. He reached a level no other boxer from India had. And one day, he lost it all. You're telling me my story? This is not your story, Vijay. He lost everything... Know why? Not that he couldn't win. But he didn't have another option. On one hand was his wife suffering from cancer and on the other, was a match. The money from the match, let alone the surgery... But it wasn't sufficient for her medicines. And then, know what he did? He started losing. He would get a handsome sum for losing. Did you hear? He would get a handsome sum for losing. People started putting their money on his defeat. And soon, he had nothing to lose. He lost his wife. And himself. And slowly, everything. I lost myself. Vijay, whenever I looked at you, I thought I am looking at myself. May be that's why I envied you. Is that why you did this? Both of our emotions are more than our intellect. That's good, in a way. But if it backfires, there'll be trouble. You have shown me the troubles very well, Gowda. I would pressurize you. Scold you... Know why? I was very well aware about your caliber. Then why did you do this, Gowda? I put you in a father's place. Signing a contract with Shetty... Requesting for a coach change... Let's assume it was all wrong. But... Who does this? How could you give me drugs, Gowda? Sorry, Vijay. There are a lot of reasons for the apology. For my anger, my rigidity... For not understanding you... But it wasn't me who gave you drugs... You will still not confess? I can't believe this. I've been thinking why you would get me involved... Because, I didn't take drugs. I'm not saying you took them. Neither did I give. There's someone involved and they're making use of our tiff. Try thinking like this. You sign a couple of deals with few people. They provide for all your comforts and luxuries. You fight and you win. They're happy. But, once you start losing... Guess what will happen. What will happen once you start losing? What will happen? You will become a liability to them. They will have to wash their hands off you. But they can't leave you alone. There would be certain obligations. So an easy way out would be to spike you with drugs. You win or lose, either way you'll be out. It's a win-win situation for them. If you're caught, the contract will be canceled. They won't have any legal obligations over them. On the previous day... What did Shetty say? What did he say, Vijay? I'm not able to recall. Think properly. Don't worry... I'll take care. And then? He said, Gowda shouldn't have done this to you. You know how we are, Vijay. We can't stand each-other. But not to an extent of ruining each other's lives. He wanted me to lose. He wanted to see me leaving the place. Because I didn't agree to work for him. Before leaving, I wanted to tell you these things. Where are you going? To Mussoorie... I've got the job of a trainer in a boarding school. Good salary. What about the Academy? You won't make an appeal? I'm tired of them and their politics. I leave at 11 tomorrow. You asked me why I don't like Shetty. I should've told you this before. But, I assumed you won't repeat my mistakes. Vijay... I might be mad at you... But I want to see the boxer in your again. It could be a problem if you keep losing. What does it mean? I mean, you should win. All of the upcoming matches. Are you threatening me, Shetty? Not threatening... Just an advice. [GRUNTS] Vijay wait. Listen to me. [SCREAMING] Drunk? Did you wake up early or you didn't sleep? What difference does it make? Nothing... Trying to understand if you want tea or something else. I met Shetty in the morning. Did you tell him you got to know everything?? Yes, in the right way. What did that bastard say to it? He was stunned. What next? I hadn't thought of it. But yesterday, I decided. I want to start boxing again. To teach that ****** a lesson. Not just start... I will win all the matches. In this condition... Will you be able to do it? No... I will need your help. You should train me. No, Vijay. I told you I'm going to Mussoorie. You know that no one else can do it other than you. Sorry, Vijay. I can't come back. I'm neither interested in them nor their politics. I'll wait for you at the Kallhalli Grounds. You better come. Or... I'll end this dream. Vijay... I'll leave now, sir. ♪♪ ♪ As you descend, may you rise again ♪ ♪ Be adamant in earning yourself back ♪ ♪ Let there be a revelation ♪ ♪ Bounce back from where you left off ♪ ♪ Bounce back from where you left off ♪ ♪ Isn't one's efforts the first step to success? ♪ ♪ The heart preaches about reaching the goal ♪ ♪ As you descend, may you rise again ♪ ♪ Be adamant in earning yourself back ♪ ♪ Let there be a revelation ♪ ♪ Bounce back from where you left off ♪ ♪ Bounce back from where you left off ♪ ♪ Isn't one's efforts the first step to success? ♪ ♪ The heart preaches about reaching the goal ♪ ♪ Isn't one's efforts the first step to success? ♪ ♪ The heart preaches about reaching the goal ♪ Remember this, Vijay. It's not one, two or three... But, TEN. No number is more important than this. Everyone is here to achieve. But these ten counts will differentiate you from them. The process is not important here... Once the counting begins, every count will be a question. Do you need this? Do you need this? Do you want all this? What's wrong with you? If they refuse? If they want to refuse, they will. We should think of... What if they agree. This is the final list. Gowda... Vijay! I didn't expect to see you both together again. It's life... We can't really predict things, Kumar. What can I do for you? You had mentioned... I can apply again, after a year. Yes, I certainly did but... The issue isn't solved, no? Who gave and who consumed. It's yet to be be solved. Sir, we're not aware either. There's someone else involved. Until that's solved, we don't want to waste our time. Gowda... What do you say? Yes, Kumar... But we can't wait until then. His future shouldn't be ruined... Because of someone else's doing, right? Kumar... See if something can be done. You can't come here as and when you please. This is Ladies PG. I need to talk. You're here at this hour. Want to get me kicked out of here as well? See... - I wanted to talk... - Ok, say. Tell me. What is it, Vijay? Shruthi, I'm sorry. I've realised my mistake. I feel bad now. Keep saying it... But nothing will change. Think about it from my shoes. Why should I? Vijay, please. I beg of you... Leave me alone. Shruthi... Don't touch me, Vijay. - Listen to me. - Don't touch me, Vijay. Please. Sorry, Shruthi. That day, I didn't know you fell. Had I known, would I leave? [BOXERS GRUNTING AND HISSING] Vijay! Go freshen up. No. That's ok. Go. Get a little freshened up. [PHONE RINGING] Yes, tell me Kumar. What is this, Kumar? Is it right? Ok. What happened? Kumar had called. They'll give you a chance again. You'll have to fight a match and if you win... You can get back to boxing again. Ok. You've to fight a higher weight category. He hasn't lost a match until now. He's known for injuring his opponent. When is the match? In three days. Then, let's not waste time. Jai! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hello everyone. A boxing match between Vijay Kumar and Mukesh Chand will be held tomorrow. This match will decide the future of Vijay Kumar. The press can put forth their questions. - Hi. - Hi, how're you, Vijay? Waiting to get into the ring. We don't have a clarity about the allegations on you. Neither are we aware. We'll let you know once we are. How do you feel about the match? I'm happy to be fighting again. Vijay Kumar, are you confident about the fight? Yes. Where is sir? He won't come, Vijay. Why? I don't know. Something must be wrong. You're training with Pradeep Gowda again. Say something about this. Getting here wouldn't be possible without him. Mr. Chand. How has your preparation been? Preparation is the usual. Like always. My opponent doesn't look strong. Looks like an easy match to me. However... We're aware of tomorrow's result... Whatever may happen to him tomorrow... Don't presume he'll get beaten up. India may again get a good boxer. Where's Gowda? What did you tell him, Shetty? Me? What would I say? What can I say That'll not bring him here? That's him, Vijay. His ego won't allow him to watch you lose. Don't think hard. Go fight. You win or lose... I'll make sure they'll allow you to box. I won't let you get away with this. You're not able to understand this... No matter what you do... Someone like me will always occupy top positions... To mess around. I haven't lost any match till now... And this won't be my first time either... My coach Harjinder Singh has... Makes me feel sad on imagining how he'll get beaten up. If Vijay Kumar wins the match, will you revoke his suspension? Definitely. But you won't be there to see that. You heard me right. Tomorrow, you don't have to come. Who are you to decide that? Listen to me, Gowda. Don't come. If you come there... I'll get him permanently banned from boxing. I'll put a defamation case. For ruining the name of the association. For getting the coach into trouble. And it goes on... Don't mess with his career again, Shetty. If I'm not there, you are aware, he won't survive in the ring. I'm well aware of that Gowda. That's exactly what I want. Don't, Shetty. If you don't come tomorrow... Keeping the match results aside... I'll get his permanent ban revoked... And get him into the association. Why are you doing this? You know I like to control people. If the two of you get together, he'll again become one of the best boxers. But he won't sign the contract with me. What's the use then, Gowda? What happened? All ok? This doesn't mean you're forgiven. That's ok. People have been questioning about the drugs case. I'm tired of repeating that... Neither my coach nor I am responsible for this. What was supposed to happen... Has happened. We couldn't stop it. I had to sit idle for a year. Whatever happened was for the good. I could comprehend about myself and my coach. Now, we're back. I'm sorry for whatever happened, Shruthi. It wasn't on purpose... There's no time for these talks. For now, come back winning... Do you remember? When we met at the bank, you narrated a joke... I want that man back. Get into the ring and bring back that Vijay. Let's go, Vijay. Get ready. I'll see you. Someone told me... The number 'ten' is very important in my life. My choices... What I'm bound to become... Will all be based on these ten counts. I've an opportunity to make things better. We'll show you what we can do in these ten counts. I'm getting into the ring again, tomorrow. I'll come back as the winner. Oh, right? Definitely. We'll go with it. Red corner-Vijay Kumar. There must be a reason why he's not here. You concentrate on the fight. Blue Corner-Chand [BELL DINGS] Good, good. Vijay c'mon. Hit harder, you ******. Very good, Chand. Come come. One He won't be able to get up. Two That's it. We're done. The match is over. Three Vijay... If you don't come, I'll stop dreaming about it too. Four Five [BELL DINGS] What's wrong, Vijay? Why aren't you fighting? Get ready for the next round. You must not let it go to the next round. C'mon. Fight, Vijay. Round 2 [BELL DINGS] Good. Good. Good. Very good. Very good, Do it. Hook. Don't let him move. Keep fighting. Perfect. Good good good. Excellent. One more, one more Knock him and finish it. Finish him, now. Very good, very good. Tell them to end this round. Kumar wants to stop. Sure, sure. Ok. You look like shit. He is fit... What about you? I'm all warmed up now. Round 3 C'mon, Vijay. C'mon, Vijay. Attack, attack. I had told you not to come. C'mon, Vijay. Why are you here? C'mon, Vijay. Attack, attack. Go sit among the audience. Heard me? C'mon, c'mon Vijay. Good going. [BELL DINGS] C'mon c'mon, that's it. Good, Vijay. Round 4 [BELL DINGS] Very good start. Very good. Take care. Vijay, concentrate. C'mon Vijay, C'mon. C'mon. Vijay, attack. Vijay, defend. You're doing well now. Finish it in this round. Okay? Use the body game technique. What are you doing? Chand! What's wrong? You have to knockout in this around to win. Tell the boxer to take it till the last round. Even if you win in the last round, Shetty will not let it happen. The points will be tallied. Listen. It's set. Don't get knocked out. Ok? Go. Vijay, you will win. Don't give up. Round 5 Ready? Ready? [BELL DINGS] Fight. C'mon, Vijay. What's going on? If he doesn't finish it in this round, he won't win. Punch! Go on, punch. What are you staring at? Punch. No Chand, stop it. Vijay, c'mon. Don't give up. No Chand, stop it we have to waste time. Chand control. [BELL DINGS THRICE]
