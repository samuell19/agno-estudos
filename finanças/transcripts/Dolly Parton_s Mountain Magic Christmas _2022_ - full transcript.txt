* I hope life treats you real kind * * I hope you have all you ever dreamed of * * Oh I do wish you joy I wish you lots of happiness * * But above all this * * I wish you love * * I will always, always love you * * I will always love you * * I will always love * * you yeah I will always love you * We love you Dolly! Oh, thank you! Thank you! How about a big hand for my mighty fine band? And the mighty fine singers? Thank you! You have made this little Smoky Mountain girl really happy and I will see you somewhere else, thank you! God bless you! Ooh Lordy, I'm hot. Give me a sip of water, Steve. Okay. Dry as a bell, hey? Oh, as long as I have worked with you that one always gets me. Oh Judy, don't start crying on me, you're gonna rust my rhinestones. Now we gotta get you outta here before they tear this place apart. - But first. - Yeah. Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Well you're not gonna stop, are you? Well then I'm not done yet! * Working 9 to 5 what a way to make a living * * Barely getting by it's all taking and no giving * * They just use your mind * It's snowing! Oh my gosh, it's snowing! I have an idea. Come on, come on. Dolly Rebecca. Hey Sam, where did I wake you up from this time? I'm wrapping a movie in Atlanta. Well, I'm sorry to call you at this ridiculous hour but I think I have an idea for the next TV show we can produce together. Yeah? Let's hear it. Well, you know, I'm always trying to do fun, uplifting, positive projects? Yes, I do. Well, that's why I'm calling. It is snowing in Tahoe. Oh, must be beautiful! And it's making me homesick for how it snows back home at Christmas! So magical and peaceful. But Sam, it is only mid-October. And I'm thinking that is some kind of a sign. Maybe some of that magic dust you're always talking about. Well honestly I do think it's more than a coincidence. I think it's a sign that I should bring some of that mountain magic to everybody this Christmas. Why don't we do a special from Dollywood? I think that's a great idea. So why don't you call Susan Roberts at NBC and see if they'd be interested? Right yeah, yeah, yeah, we've had good luck there with the Coat of Many Colors and the Christmas of Many Colors. And with you riding a tidal wave of popularity right now. Well I'm gonna start getting songs together, why don't you start getting ideas together? I'm already thinking about who we can invite to be our guest stars. Well now we need to start with some of my friends 'cause I want the show to reflect the things that are meaningful to me. Maybe like sharing my love of reading with children? Hey maybe we'll get kids to start asking Santa for books in addition to toys. Well if anyone could pull that off, it's you. And I want to use some of our Dollywood family because we have the best singers, dancers, and musicians available and they look good, too. I'm getting the Christmas spirit just thinking about it. Well great, well we'll talk later but I gotta get back to the snow! Oh, I love it, I love it, I love it! It's snowing, I can't believe it. * Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm * * Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm * * Mountain magic I can feel it all around me * * Mountain magic as pure as mountain snow * * Mountain people are as sweet as mountain honey * * I can feel the mountain magic in my soul * * I love to wake up early to the sounds and sights of nature * * Get up before the sun to watch it rise * * Walk down the lane and marvel at God's wondrous creations * * It's magic when these mountains come alive * * Mountain magic I can feel it all around me * * Mountain magic as pure as mountain snow * * Mountain people are as sweet as mountain honey * * I can feel the mountain magic in my soul * I love it! Dolly Parton, Christmas, Dollywood! I'm starting to cry just thinking about it, wow. I can't help it, you know why? Because this is exactly what we need right now. I mean, everyone is so disheartened and tense and gloomy. And nobody lifts up an audience better than Dolly. Exactly, so let's pull out all the stops, make it Dolly 2.0! I want the biggest, splashiest, most Christmas-y show ever! I mean dancers, guest stars, Santa Claus, kids, get a whole bunch of kids, people love kids. I mean give me all that, and then give me some more. You know who we should get to stage it, and Dolly loves her, Kathryn Burns. Yes! Oh, that would be perfect. Oh! But wait, Let's make it an event. We'll do a live show. Whoa uh, a live special? No, a live holiday event. I mean, wouldn't that be fantastic? Uh yes, but you know, it takes like 6 months or more to pull off a live event um... We only have 10 weeks. You and Dolly can do anything. Just use some of that mountain magic. But make it big! Ah, I love Christmas! - Kathryn, welcome to Dollywood! - Sam! - Hey. - Hi, here's my assistant choreographer, Jasmine. - Oh. - Well come on. Say hello to Sam Haskell.- - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Oh, wow. I feel like I'm Alice in Wonderland. Oh, here's writer producer David Rambo. - Hi! - I'm a big fan. Oh my gosh, thank you. And producers, Hudson Hickman and Billy Levin. Hello, hello! Ugh, Jasmine, picture it. Dozens of dancers uh, Dolly leading us through the park, arms wide open, we crane up, and it's Merry Christmas with a mountain on top. - Yes! - Budget's kinda tight so uh, - maybe not too big. - Big is what you hired me for. Hey, you're just in time! We're decorating the park for Christmas! Go tell it! Tell it! Tell it! Go tell it! Tell it! Tell it! Spread the word! Spread the word! Jesus Christ is born! Hallelujah! He is born! * Oh go tell it, tell it, go tell it, tell it * * Go tell it, tell it, go tell it, tell it * * Go tell it on the mountain * * over the hills and everywhere * * Go tell it on the mountain * * That Jesus Christ is born * * Oh go tell it on the mountain * * over the hills and everywhere * * Go tell it on the mountain * * That Jesus Christ is born * * Go tell it, tell it, Jesus Christ is born * * Away in a manger * * no crib for his bed * * The little lord Jesus * * Lay down his sweet head * * The stars in the sky * * look down where he lay * * The little lord Jesus * * Asleep in the hay * * Go tell it, tell it, go tell it, tell it * * Go tell it, tell it, go tell it, tell it * * Go tell it on the mountain * * Over the hills and everywhere * * Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born * * He's alive, he's alive, he's alive * * Go tell it, tell it, he's alive * * He's alive, he's alive, he's alive, he's alive * * He's alive, go tell it, tell it * * He's alive, he's alive, he's alive, oh he's alive * * He's alive, he's alive and I'm forgiven * * heaven's gates are open wide, he's alive, he's alive * * Oh he's alive, he's alive * * He's alive and I'm forgiven * * Heaven's gates are open wide * * He's alive, he's alive * - How's my girl today? - Oh, well I'm fine and dandy. Why wouldn't I be with you and Kathryn in charge? And I'm glad to see you didn't forget your right arm, - morning Judy. - Morning. Oh, don't worry, she never forgets me. Sam you remember my little grand nephew, Liam. - Hi, Liam. - Yeah, his mom and daddy are busy today so I'm putting him to work on the show. Wouldn't he make the perfect little elf for our show? - He sure would. - They're gonna get you - in a costume. - Perfect. How are we doing getting your sisters and family here for their big number? Everything... Um, um, uh okay, production meeting, right now. Can we get the set deck out here? - Yeah, where is Gentry? - Wanna talk through some logistics that are hap... - Good morning, everybody! - Good morning! - How's it going? - Good, I was just reminding everyone that the clock's ticking down for our live broadcast tonight, so today is all about our final dress rehearsal of each of the numbers, costumes, cameras, full out energy, okay? And we'll also be going out into Dollywood to do some pre-tapes of some of the numbers so we can swap them into the live show. Like Dolly's duet with Jimmy Fallon, and then we also... Look out! Has anybody found Gentry yet? Again? I mean when something happens once I'd say that's an accident, but twice? I think that's a sign I need to be doing something. Then on page 37 where Dolly's supposed to say... Isn't it a little late for dialogue changes? - Absolutely. - We are now officially A half hour behind schedule. Hello, Dolly! What can we do for you? Well you could start by wiping those fake smiles off your faces I know what's going on. We're supposed to be doing a dress rehearsal and we're not ready. - Of all the luck. - What's the matter? Oh, it's nothing. Oh, I think it's more than nothing, what is it? Well, wouldn't you know it just when I have my dream job working with you, my other lifelong dream just came calling to choreograph the Radio City Rockettes. - Oh! - But I'd have to be on a plane like right away so it's okay, I'm turning it down. No! You can't do that. That's a puff of magic dust, you have to take it! That's your dream coming true. No, no, no, no, she can't leave, no, no, we're in the middle of dress rehearsal, yeah, we go live tonight. Oh Jasmine can handle it from here, right Jasmine? - Sure. - Thank you. You gotta live your dream. - Oh, really? You mean it? - I mean it. Scat, Kat. Thank you, thank you so much, Dolly. Jasmine if you need anything at all, remember I'm just a phone call away, okay? Have a good show, y'all. Merry Christmas! Magic dust my butt. Well, okay then. Let's go people! Over to the Jimmy Fallon pre-tape, now! Okay yeah, no, the network loves how we're doing this number, so. Cool. Good thing the park's closed today or she'd be mobbed. She's the pied piper, she knows how to draw a crowd. Oh no. - Hello, Susan. - Please tell me your choreographer didn't leave the day of your live broadcast. Well, yes but don't worry, her assistant's got everything running like clockwork. People, we are hours behind schedule. Get your butts in gear! I heard that. Sam, the show tonight has to be perfect, okay? The world needs it, I need it. Sam, you have no idea how much pressure I am under right now, okay? I really, I need a break. I need like a therapeutic escape somewhere. I'm counting on you. Merry Christmas. Merry... Well how is my favorite New York city bad boy? How's my favorite smoky mountain greasy chick right? Oh! We're dressed the part, how do you like the jacket I designed for you? It's subtle, it's subtle. What are we gonna get to eat? - Milkshake. - Milkshake. Jinx. - Alright we'll start with that... - So, Jimmy, hi. This is the number that I taught you up in New York - Yeah. - but since you and Dolly have not had a chance to run it together, I say let's rehearse one. Well we're running so late already, Jasmine, why don't we just go for one, let's do a take. - We know what we're doing. - Sure. Alright, then. Marks! Let's roll! Oh, the mouse has learned to roar. I don't care if she roars, clucks, or cackles as long as she keeps us from getting any further behind. Okay, Almost Too Early for Christmas pre-tape. Take one, action! * It's almost too early for Christmas * * Too soon to be singing this song * * There's still Halloween decorations * * And haters will say that it's wrong * * Let's turn on the lights for Mariah * * Tell Rudolph to shine up his nose * * It's almost too early for Christmas * * But why don't we see how it goes? * * Why don't we see how it goes? * * So jingle bells and deck the halls * * I'm coming home I miss you all * * I'm giving thanks for Santa's sleigh * * so grab a deer and make it rain * * Even in the autumn weather * * we'll be wearing ugly sweaters * * So string up the lights, string up the lights * * This silent night, this silent night * * we're having the time of our lives, the time of our lives * * It's almost too early for Christmas * * Too soon to be singing this song * * There's still Halloween decorations * * And haters will say that it's wrong * * Let's turn on the lights for Mariah * * Tell Rudolph to shine up his nose * * It's almost too early for Christmas * * But why don't we see how it goes? * * Window displays are full of snow * * Candy cane clouds are come and go * * put on your sugar coat * * It's almost too early for Christmas * * Too soon to be singing this song, singing this song * * There's still Halloween decorations * * Too early, and haters will say that it's wrong, no * * Let's turn on the lights for Mariah * * Tell Rudolph to shine up his nose * * It's almost too early for Christmas * * But why don't we see how it goes? * * Even in the autumn weather * * We'll be wearing ugly sweaters * * Can't stop us now, can't stop us now * * It's all around 'cause never too early for Christmas * Woo! And you thought we couldn't dance. Got it in one take! That should put us back on schedule. No. Ooh-wee! Dolly, that was amazing! Oh, I always have a good time with you, Jimmy. Why do you look troubled as a tap dancer with a piece of corn in her shoe? Sorry, these mountains bring out the folksy similes in me. Well, maybe it's just that Smoky Mountain magic. Oh now you got me blushing like a, like a dry paintbrush full of barn paint. You got me red like a bubbling fruit pie in the oven. - I'm like a wet cow who's... - Hey Jimmy, I get the idea. Okay, sorry. But I got you to smile, right? You always make me smile but you know what? I admit you caught me thinking. See I been thinking about those wonderful magical Smoky Mountain Christmases that I had as a child and I'm not sure our show is gonna have that. Sounds like you're hankering to connect with your past. You know, I admit you might have a point there. Everything on this park is about my life, I mean we even got the old cabin I grew up in, we got the church I went to, there's even that old gristmill we used to play in. Willie? This must be some sort of magic dust. Willie? What's, what's going on here? Just think of me as a wise old mountain man. - I'm full of wisdom. - Well, I know you're full of it. But how wise are you, Willie? Wise enough to know that you're troubled, my intuition told me that. And I've known you a long time, Doll. - Intuition, huh? - Yeah, come here and sit with me, we've got some talking to do. We do? How in the world did you find our old family album? - Mountain magic. - You know, we were really poor when we were growing up and we didn't have all that pretty paper to wrap our gifts in, so we used newspapers. But come Christmas morning, we thought they were the prettiest things in the whole world. * Pretty paper * * pretty ribbons of blue * * Wrap your presents * * to your darling from you * * Pretty pencils * * To write I love you * * Pretty paper * * Pretty ribbons of blue * * Crowded streets * * Busy feet hustle by him * * Downtown shoppers * * Christmas is nigh * * And there he sits * * All alone on the sidewalk * * Hoping that you won't pass him by * * Should you stop * * Better not much too busy * * You're in a hurry * * My how time flies * * And in the distance * * The ringing of laughter * * And in the midst of * * The laughter he cries * * Pretty paper * * Pretty ribbons of blue * * Wrap your presents * * To your darling from you * * Pretty pencils * * To write I love you * * Oh pretty paper, pretty ribbons * * Of blue * * Pretty paper, pretty ribbons * * Of blue * Willie, you've got me remembering things that I forgot that I forgot. Well, that was the idea. You're probably wanting something to write it all down in, right? My old diary! Oh, look it there. I mean, everything is in there, all my childhood memories, boys I had crushes on, dreams, plans. And songs I wrote when I was a little girl. Don't you wanna write down what you're thinking about? You know that, too? Boy, you are a wise old owl, ain't you? Oh, yeah. Pretty pencils to write, "I love you". - Aw. - Hi, Gigi. Liam? What are you doing here? Willie I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go. Who you talking to? You don't see anybody? I am so glad that Willie helped me remember those wonderful Christmases we had. Now none of us ever expected to get much and we didn't, yet somehow everybody got a little something. And we were thrilled to have it. Course, mom and daddy were as happy as us kids to get a present. I think that might be what Willie wanted me to remember, everybody is a kid at Christmas, it's just part of the magic. Come on, you little elf, we gotta get out of here before somebody realizes we're gone. Places, please for the opening number. Please welcome Grammy and Emmy award winning superstar, Dolly Parton. Christmas here in the great Smokey Mountains is so special and uplifting. In fact, you might say we've got mountain magic. And we're gonna share a whole heapin' helping of that with you tonight. * Ah ah ah ah * * Ah ah ah ah * * Ah ah ah ah * Ah ah ah ah * * Mountain magic, mountain magic * * I can feel it all around me mountain magic, mountain magic * * pure as mountain snow, mountain people * - Go wider. - No no no. Stay tight on Dolly. No, take the wide shot. It's the opening number, we need to see the dancers. No, no, no, no, no, that's not what we talked about. Tight on Dolly. Are you people serious? This ain't country. I'm the damn choreographer now and I say go wide. Well, I'm the damn producer and I say stay on Dolly. Who's big idea was this big ass hoop skirt? I mean, I feel like one of those dolls that fits over a roll of toilet paper. It's not only over the top, it's dangerous in here! Is Gentry in the building? Oh, good lord. Well, I know you worked hard but I ain't doing it. But Ms. Parton... Oh don't, 'But Ms. Parton' me. I said I ain't doing it. And I ain't. I don't like it, I ain't doing it. Now I know how Elvis felt trying to do those Hollywood TV specials. We're having a big show but we can't see the star. It doesn't matter if we're not having an opening number! Oh, none of this feels right to me. - Come on! - Oh, come on, yourself. [grunting Dang it, ugh! First we gotta fix this! Y'all know what's going on here, don't you? Hey, Dolly. All that anger, cussing? That ain't nothing but the devil's doings. We're trying to lift people up and Satan is trying to tear us down! Well Satan, you old ugly devil, we are going to send you straight back to hell! * Ah * * Go to hell, go to hell, go back where you belong * * Get thee behind me, Satan, just leave me alone * * You're a cheat, you're a liar, you're a scoundrel and a thief * * Go to hell in a handbasket 'cause heaven waits for me * * Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell, go to hell * * Go to hell in a handbasket 'cause heaven waits for me * * Oh I tried hard to conquer my fears and my doubts * * Everywhere I turn I see your evil doings all about * * I have suffered your sorrow your heartache and grief * * You keep dealing me a bad hand * * with a trick card up your sleeve * * Go to hell, go to hell, go back where you belong * * Get thee behind me, Satan, just leave me alone * * Take all of your bad guys, your demons and flee * * Go to hell in a handbasket, heaven's calling me * * Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell, go to hell * * Go to hell in a handbasket 'cause heaven waits for me * My brothers and my sisters! Ha! I am here to tell you that Satan is real! Ha! He is real and walking around amongst us. trying to destroy everything that's good and beautiful! Ha! He wants to break our hearts and minds! Ha! Destroy our dreams and plans! Ha! He wants to tear us up into little pieces, break us down and send us straight to hell! Oh, my God. Aha! You've said a mouthful, brother. Oh my God, oh my God can do anything! Ha! - Hallelujah! - My god can heal the sick! Ha! Mend broken hearts and take our souls to heaven! Ha! So Satan, listen up! Ha! In God's name I rebuke you! Ha! I stand up in his name, look you in the eye, and laugh in your ugly face! Ha, ha, ha! * Go to hell, go to hell, go back where you belong * * Get thee behind me, Satan, just leave me alone * * Take your drugs and your alcohol * * your lust and your greed * * Go to hell with your corruption * * just get away from me * * Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell, go to hell * * Go to hell in a handbasket 'cause heaven waits for me * * Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell, go to hell * * Go to hell in a handbasket 'cause heaven waits for me * * Go to hell in a handbasket * * heaven's calling * * me, heaven, heaven waits for me * * So go to hell * Well we kicked Satan's butt straight back to hell. Now let's get this show started! Y'all pray for me. to sit down like how we practiced. Moms, I need you in the back, you're not in the shot. Kids, please sit down. When I was coming in here I saw a whole bunch of kids out there, did you see some of them out there? - Hey, Dolly. - Well hey, Mary Lane, I'm so glad you're doing the show with us. You're my good luck charm. - Who's your little elf? - Well, this is Liam. This is my little grand nephew and this is Mary Lane, she played Ms. Moody the teacher in the Coat of Many Colors movie the story about me as a little girl. - And Christmas of Many Colors. - That's true, we've both seen them lots of times, ain't we Liam? And she's gonna play Ms. Moody again as a teacher in our show. Can everyone... Alright, I need you up out of the seats. Sit down, can you... Alright, well... We're already in our second crew lunch penalty, I don't have a budget for a third. Alright, listen up kids uh, this is uh, ho-ho-ho, this is Santa Claus talking now and anyone who doesn't settle down and do what Ms. Jasmine says right now is gonna get nothing but uh, oatmeal in their stocking for Christmas. - Good morning, class. - Good morning, Ms. Moody. Now children, we have a very special guest with us today. - She's known as the book lady. - Hello, book lady. Well hello, class, I'm glad to be with you today. How'd you get that name? Well, I started a program called the Imagination Library. - Does anybody know what that is? - Free books for kids! - Mhmmm. - You're absolutely right. You see, I started this program in honor of my daddy who believed that all children should have a great education and we started it right here in my hometown and then it just grew and grew and grew and now it's just all over the place. So far, Dolly's Imagination Library has given away almost 200 million books. - Wow. - To children just like you all around the world. That's a lot of books. Who loves books? - Me. - I do. Yeah, so do I. I even wrote a song about books. - Would you like to hear it? - Yeah. Would you like to sing along with me on it? Okay, well I got my banjo, let's do it, here we go. * Books, books, I love books * * the way they feel and smell and look * * From my first look I was hooked on books, books, books * Sing! * Books, books, I love books * * The way they feel and smell and look * * From my first look I've been hooked on books, books, books * * Books, books, books, I love books * Sweet, but is it big enough? It's big enough considering we go live in... Shh. It's big enough. 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there. What's that? What's that noise? Santa! Hand me that pretty little guitar over there. How special is that? I believe in Santa Claus, do you? Yeah! Well, I even wrote a song about that, here we go! * I believe in Santa Claus * * I believe in Santa Claus * * I believe there's always hope when all seems lost * * I believe in Santa Claus * * I believe in Santa Claus, I'll tell you why I do * * 'Cause I believe that dreams and plans and wishes * * can come true * * I believe in miracles, I believe in magic too * * I believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you * * I believe in Santa Claus * * I believe in Santa Claus * * I believe there's always hope when all seems lost * Ho, ho, ho, ho! * Yes, I believe in Santa Claus * * Yes, I believe in Santa Claus * Excuse me, excuse me. Cut, cut! Great job, kids. - Thank you, Dolly. - Well, you're welcome. Couldn't Clyde do more with Dolly? They have such great chemistry. My Angela really needs a line. Okay no, no... The camera loves her! Liam. You get up here. What are you doing under there, you little rascal? Nothing. Well, I don't want to catch you doing nothing again, don't you know girls get dressed in here? Yeah, that's what I thought. I want you to go out in the hall and wait for me and I don't want you to get into any more trouble, okay? - Okay. - I gotta get changed! - Will you take this? Alright? - Okay, Gigi. Now how did he get back here before I did? Just another puff of magic dust, I guess. Ain't he the cutest thing you ever seen? You know, I know he's a special little boy and I don't know what he's gonna grow up to be but it will be something special. And whatever it is, I'm gonna always be proud of him and I'm gonna accept and love him no matter what or who he is because I believe that whoever you are, be that. * Whoever you are, be that * * Whatever you do, do that * * Anything else is just an act * * Whoever you are, be that * * Some may leave you little choice * * don't be afraid to find your voice * * Speak your mind and make some noise * Looking great. * They call that being free * * and stand up for who and what you are * Let's go! * God knows the intent of your heart * * he doesn't want us in the dark * * He's there, he wants to help * * So whoever you are, be that * * Whatever you do, do that * * 'Cause it's your right and that's a fact * * Whoever you are, be that * * No one has a right to say * * You should be this or that way * * And be that as it may I say * * To thine own self be true * * God made us all so many ways * * and he forgives us when we pray * * And he's gonna love us either way * * He wants you to be you * * Whoever you are, be that * * Whatever you do, do that * * 'Cause anything else is just an act * * Whatever you are, be that * * Whatever you are * * Whatever you do * * Whoever you are, what you do * * Whatever you are, be that * * Misfits, outcasts, rebels, strays * * whatever you are, you're okay * Ah yeah, great. Hey, you know what I wanna be? - Back on schedule. - Well whatever you do, do that. Uh, where's Jimmy Allen? He's supposed to be doing his duet with Dolly right now. I just saw him at catering. Might be a minute. There's a line. Can I please give these dialogue tweaks before they run out of hush puppies? Nobody's going for hush puppies or anything else. We're in trouble here. We're two hours behind and we have half the show left to produce, the set's falling apart, and we lost our choreographer, and her replacement thinks that we're staging the uh, the Macy's Parade. Sam! You know I love you, I will always love you but how am I supposed to lift people up if you're melting down? I'm gonna go in my dressing room 'til you simmer down. Just cool it. I think Sam finally broke. - He's talking to himself. - Oh no, he's praying. He does that when things go from bad to really bad. Being in show business is like being a doctor. You gotta have a lot of patience. And everybody thinks I got a lot of patience but I really don't, it's hard. Everybody puts me on some sort of a pedestal, I don't belong there. I'm no angel, I just play one on TV. And I'm no saint. But I love that old saying that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future and I'm pretty sure I'm just like most of you out there. I'm just here trying to do the best I can. Trying to make a difference if I can. I wrote this song and I think it's gonna fit a lot of you just like it does me. * I am a seeker, a poor, sinful creature * * There is no weaker than I am * * I am a seeker and you are a teacher * * And you are the leader so reach down * * Would you reach out and lead me? * * Guide me, keep me in the shelter of your care * * Each day * * 'Cause I am a seeker * * And you are a teacher * * And you are the leader * * won't you show me the way * * Lord won't you show me * * show me the way * You know, I think I heard what Willie was trying to say to me. Am I really doing what I'm supposed to be doing? Am I doing God's will, my will, or theirs? * Hello God, are you out there Can you hear me * * Are you listening anymore * * Hello God, if we're still on speaking terms * * can you help me like before * * I have questioned your existence my resistance * * leaves me cold can you help me go the distance * * Hello God, hello, hello * * This whole world has gone to pieces * * Can we fix it Is there time * * Hate and violence just increases * * we're so selfish, cruel, and blind * * We fight and kill each other * * In your name defending you * * as if you love some more than others * * Well I can't believe that's true * * Hello God, we really need you * * We can't make it without you * * Hello God please forgive us * * For we know not what we do * * And the free will you have given * * we have made a mockery of * * This is no way to be living * * We're in great need of your love * * Hello God are you out there Can you hear me * * Are you listening anymore * I'm good! I'm Prancer. I don't know, in that outfit you're more like a Vixen. - Aw, thank you, thank you. - Sorry I'm late I was uh, in a dessert line and I do love me some funnel cakes. Oh I love them too, I can't resist them. Dolly and Jimmy? We're ready. - Places, please. - Sound man, hit me! - Hey, Dolly! - Hey! * Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind * Oh you're the king, Rudolph! * Run, run, Rudolph Randolph ain't too far behind * * Run, run, Rudolph Santa's gotta make it to town * * Santa, make him hurry * * tell him he can take the freeway down * * Oh yeah * * Run, run, Rudolph I reelin' like a merry go round * * Said Santa to the boy child * * "What have you been longing for?" * Oh I bet you want something special. * All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar * He wants a big old electric guitar. * Then away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star * I see him as he's goin'. * Run, run, Rudolph Santa's gotta make it to town * * Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down * * Run, run, Rudolph I'm reelin' like a merry go round * * Oh yeah * * Santa said to the girl child * * "What would please you most to get?" * Come on, now. * A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet * * Then away went Rudolph whizzin' like a Saber jet * I see him. * Run, run, Rudolph Santa's gotta make it to town * * Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down * * Run, run, Rudolph I'm reelin' like a merry go round * * Run, run, Rudolph Santa's gotta make it to town * * Yeah yeah * And cut! That was perfect! - I like that one! - Oh, that was fun. - But it's not big enough. - Ugh, Jasmine. What happened to that shy little thing that was hiding in Kathryn's shadow? Well, you nailed it when you said I wanted to stage the Macy's Day Parade. When I was a kid I was always staging something like that in my imagination. Or the Oscars or Super Bowl halftime show. Dreams like that kept me alive growing up in foster homes. - Bless your heart. - I don't have family. I spend Christmas watching holiday rom-coms crying into my popcorn. So to get the opportunity to stage something like this? Sam, this is what I have been dreaming of my whole... I know what it needs! Chimney sweeps dancing with the reindeer, yes! Okay, props, dancers, on stage, now! Judy, we've known each other long time, since grammar school maybe - 12 years. - 15 years ago. Something like that. But seriously, I need to ask your opinion on something. You're the only person I can really trust to tell me the truth. Don't you think that all the scenery, all the dancers, all the costumes, is just a little bit over the top? That coming from a girl with hooves and antlers and a rhinestone reindeer suit? Really? But seriously though, I need a little bit of time by myself. You see, I need to think because my head is just really screwed up. Well why don't you try unscrewing your antlers? Well that's a good idea, I wanna get out of all this garb and my hooves are just killing me. I bet. So why don't you just hurry on out of here and let me be alone - 'cause I need to ponder. - Yes, ma'am. Okay. Dolly! What you doing, girl? Billy Ray, how'd you get on that train? It's not even running today. Boy, it must be some of that mountain magic. You know, my buddy Willie said you might be in need of some wise advice. - Well, have you got some for me? - I might. Huh, really? Well, come sit down and tell me about it. - 'Cause I've been struggling. - What's your problem? Well I'm trying to do this big uplifting Christmas special here in my hometown and, you know, I wanted everybody to be happy like I remembered, I wanted the snow to be falling but it's not feeling right and there's no snow. Dolly, now you of all people, you know you don't need all that stuff to make it feel like Christmas. You know, I think you might be right. * Now I don't need Central Park or snowy weather * * And I don't care if it's 98 degrees * * Just as long as we can be together * * Anywhere you are is fine by me * * Well now I don't need to wrap up boxes * * Or put lights on a tree * * All I want is you right here beside me * * Your love is the only gift I need * * Well I don't need tinsel and lights * * or a tree with a star * * All I need, all I need is to hold you tight * * No matter how near or far * * We can have Christmas where we are * * Christmas where we are hmm hmm * * You can have your Tennessee Christmas * * And your evergreens * * We can keep this spirit with us * * wherever it may lead * * Oh oh oh * * Oh oh oh * * I can be your silent night * * and I'll be your noel * * All the joy you bring to my life is * * sweeter than silver bells * * Oh I don't need tinsel and lights * * or a tree with a star * * All I need, all I need is to hold you tight * * No matter how near or far it don't matter baby * * No matter how near or far * * We can have Christmas where we are * * We can have Christmas where we are * * Hmm hmm, oh Merry Christmas, baby * * Merry Christmas baby * * Let's have Christmas where we are * That was good! Come sit. Oh, I love singing with you Billy Ray. We've been friends a long time, ain't we? Yeah. You know, you've got me thinking on some things I wanted to remember. I just wish I had something to write it down on. Oh yeah, I just so happen to have this. Willie said you carry your own pencil. Oh so Willie told you about that too, huh? I know all these years y'all thought I was chesty. I'm just packing a lot of stuff in here. Boy, you wise guys sure know how to show up just when I need you. Who you calling a wise guy? Judy said you needed some time alone and I figured I'd find you up here. You know, Willie taught me to remember that at Christmas, we'll always be the kids that we were in Christmases past. And now, Billy Ray's got me realizing that it's who you're with in the present that really makes it Christmas. But you still haven't told me, who you calling a wise guy? Well I, I'm calling you a wise guy, Steve, you are so wise. I mean, that's why I count on you for everything. - Good lord how'd you get so big? - Ah, same way you got so small. - God's doings. - God's doings? I'd have been as tall as you if I hadn't got so bunched up at the top. Oh now, you know, I wish it would snow. Oh Steve, you don't really need snow to make it a Christmas full of magic, it's all about who you're with. Whoa! Man, what was that? - Miley? Is that you? - Where's Gentry? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I just dodged some falling scenery, but it's okay. - Well golly, you look beautiful. - Merry Christmas, Aunt Dolly. - Merry Christmas. - So do you. I'm still in my robe, you're all dressed up. - You look fabulous. - Oh well, thank you. I'm sorry I'm running late, Aunt Dolly. Well I know where you were. How many roller coasters have you ridden today? All of them, some of them two or three times. Are you a speed freak or an adrenaline junkie? I'm all of it now let's get back to work so I can get on the Wild Eagle. Well we'll get you back to work and on the Wild Eagle but I just wanted to take a minute to say something to you and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I'm really proud of you, I've always been proud of you and I'm proud to be your fairy godmother and you know one thing that touches me most of all is when you had me on the Hannah Montana show back years ago? You really helped my career, you introduced me to a whole new set of fans! Young ones! Course, they're not all as young as they used to be now. Well, you wrote the handbook on how to stay young. Well I've got the doctor bills to prove that. And when the time comes, you're giving me all the numbers. Oh, I'm saving them for you. I bet it looks like the yellow pages by now. - Oh, ain't you funny. - Alright everyone, - on their marks. - Okay smiley Miley, - are you ready? - I'm ready, Aunt Dolly. Here we go. * Hmm hmm, uh-huh, mhmmm * * Christmas is a time for caring being at your best * * Christmas is a time for sharing * * knowing you've been blessed * * Christmas is a time for giving love is made of this * * That's what Christmas is * * Christmas is a joyful time if you're the lucky ones * * Some are blessed with gifts and trinkets others have none * * Some have feasts upon the table others having crumbs * * There are the haves and the have nots * * and you could be either one * * It's all about kindness, love, and compassion * * Better to give than receive * * That is a true fact for those who don't know that * * Well they are the poorest indeed * * And I hope you remember * * Every December * * That bright shining light from above * * The promise from God's lips the greatest of all gifts * * Wrapped up in his wondrous love, his wondrous love * * so rejoice in his glory, glory * * the great Christmas story * * And to all that you're sharing it with * * uh-huh * * You go tell it with passion and love everlasting * * 'Cause that's what Christmas * * Is * * it's a time for caring being at your best * * Christmas is a time for sharing * * knowing you've been blessed * * Christmas is a time for giving love is made of this * * That's what Christmas * * Is * * hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm, hmm * * That's what Christmas is that's what Christmas is * You had to have the last word, didn't you? I'm cold in here, - are you cold? - Yeah. I think they're afraid they're gonna melt the fake snow. - Oh great, thank you. - That was good, good! - But it needs more. - No, I thought it was great - like it was, pure and simple. - I love it. - We like it. - And I love funnel cake. You're not gonna finish that, right? I got it. So, I know what it needs. - More carolers and, and... - No, it was great. When the music swells, they make the tree dance. Jasmine, no, we don't have time for that. No more carolers, no dancing trees. I can stage it in 10 minutes. No flaming popcorn balls, nothing. I just need more lights maybe, more... I don't think you're listening to me, - there's no money. - What if we get the little elf to just run across the stage at the same time? We're at the point where less is more. No, no! It's Dolly and it's Miley - La, la, la, la. - and it's a big moment! Can't hear you adding things when we can't add anything. Zach Williams, don't tell me you're another one of those wise mountain men that I'm gonna see today. Well I don't know how wise I am but I do know a wiser man than both of us and he's telling me you could use a friend. Well you see, I wanted my special to be fun and full of joy, you know, like those great mountain Christmases of a long time ago. - Mhmmm. - And I know everybody's trying to do their best to try to make it right. But it's just kinda like a balloon, you know, that just keeps getting puffed up bigger and bigger and bigger - and you know what happens then. - Yes, ma'am. Well that's why I pray every day for guidance. Well I definitely know a thing or two about needing guidance. Well, I think we all need some guidance. * Every time I try to make it on my own * * Every time I try to stand and start to fall * * And all those lonely roads that I have traveled on * * There was Jesus * * When the life I built came crashing to the ground * * When the friends I had were nowhere to be found * * I couldn't see it then but I can see it now * * Well there was Jesus * * In the waiting, in the searching * * in the healing and the hurting * * Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces * * Every minute, every moment * * where I've been and where I'm going * * Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it * * There was Jesus * * For this man who needs amazing kind of grace * * Hmm, hmm * * The forgiveness at a price I couldn't pay * * I'm not perfect so I thank God every day * * Well there was Jesus * * There was Jesus * * In the waiting, in the searching * * in the healing and the hurting * * Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces * * Every minute, every moment * * Where I've been and where I'm going * * Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it * * There was Jesus on the mountain * * In the valleys, there was Jesus * * In the shadows of the alleys there was Jesus * * In the fire and the flood * * There was Jesus * * Always is and always was * * No I never walk alone never walk alone * * You are always there * * In the waiting, and the searching * * In the healing and the hurting * * Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces * * Every minute, every minute, every moment, every moment * * Where I've been and where I'm going * * Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it * * There was Jesus * * There was Jesus, there was Jesus * * There was Jesus * So I'm thinking you're thinking you might wanna write some of this down. Well is there anything you wise men don't know? You know, I thought this show was the right thing to do and I felt like I would know what was right and what was wrong. But I guess I haven't been paying attention, that's not unusual for me. My husband always said, "You're not hard of hearing, you're just hard of listening." Well it's like I've always said, I've always been just a little too good to be real bad and a little too bad to be real good. But that is gonna change, right now. - I'm glad they all got in okay. - Yeah. You know you're an honorary member of this family, I really think you should join in on the song with us. No, I may have the honor but I sure didn't get the voice. Oh, but we love you anyway. Thanks, Rachel and Cassie, y'all look so pretty. - Don't they fix up good? - Mhmmm. Jasmine, I only have enough time to rehearse this once. Okay, ladies. Clock's ticking, so if everybody could please just be perfect. - Oh, okay we can try that. - Yeah, we can try. Well I cannot believe of all the singing sisters I have I could only muster up the two of you. Muster up? You say that like we're the worst of the lot. Yeah, what are we? Chopped possum? Chopped possum, that's a good 'un, Cassie. I didn't mean that, I just meant that trying to get a bunch of women together is like trying to herd a bunch of ground squirrels so at least let's say hi to 'em. Hi, everybody! Merry Christmas! And hope for snow! You know, I think I love snow so much because I was born in a big old snow storm. Daddy had to ride down, bring up Dr. Thomas to deliver you. We paid for you with a sack of cornmeal. Yeah, I know and I have been raking in the dough ever since. How many times have we heard that? Remember when you wanted to be a star and you promised to do our chores for a week or whatever if we'd do background singing? - Yeah. - And you had the big idea for us to sing in pig Latin? I remember working you to death on that. Let's see if we can still remember it. I bet we can, let's see. * Oh e-shay as-way eye-may est-bay end-fray * * e-shay as-way eye-may est-bay end-fray * * ooh she's the friendliest enemy I believe ever did see * * And she'd better get my baby off her mind * off-ay er-hay ind-may, she's the friendliest enemy * * I believe ever did see better watch your friends * * or they will steal you blind eal-stay ou-yay ind-blay * * Oh e-shay as-way eye-may est-bay end-fray * * e-shay as-way eye-may est-bay end-fray * * e-shay as-way eye-may est-bay end-fray * * e-shay as-way eye-may est-bay end-fray * * Ooh * That was fun! Oh we might've been a little nicer to you had we known you were gonna grow up to be - Dolly Parton. - Dolly Parton. - Oh, ain't you something. - Well, I hope what we did to you back then didn't hurt your feelings too much. Well I think some people deserve to suffer a little. Now ain't you a funny rascal. Hey, why don't we bring out some more of our family and have them sing something with us that's not in pig Latin, what do you say? - I think it'd be great. - Okay, this is all about family. We know all about that, don't we? * When it's family you forgive them * * for they know not what they do * * When it's family you accept them * * 'cause you have no choice but to * * When it's family * * they're a mirror of the worst and best in you * * And they always put you to the test * * Never clean up all the mess * * You just pray for God to do the rest * * When it's family * * Some are preachers, some are gay * * some are addicts, drunks, and strays but * * Not a one is turned away * * When it's family * * Some are lucky, others ain't * * some are fighters, others faint * * Some are sinners, some are saints * * And it's all family * * When it's family * * You trust them and your heart's an open door * * When it's family * * You tolerate what you'd kill others for * * When it's family * * You love and hate and take then give some more * * Somehow you just defy the mistakes * * and try to find a better way * * To solve the problems day to day * * in the family * * You take the trouble as it comes * * Love them more than anyone * * Good or bad or indifferent * * It's still family * * You choose your lovers, you pick your friends * * But not the family that you're in * * They'll be with you 'til the end * * Family * * When it's family * * When it's family * * Let me be all that I should be * * to the family * * Hmm, hmm, hmm * That's me, about 3 or 4 years old out standing in my field. Get it? Outstanding in my field? And I'd like to think I still am. You know when I was little, I used to stand on the porch, put a tobacco stick down in one of the cracks and I'd put a tin can on top and just sing my little heart out to the chickens and the kids and I was thinking that I was singing to the whole wide world out there. You know I've learned that what happened yesterday affects what happens today and what happens today affects what happens tomorrow. Whether that's 24 hours or 10 years away. Now that's what any wise man or any wise woman would tell you. Yesterday this little girl had hope and today this little girl still has hope and at Christmas every kid has hope. That's magic in the mountains or any place else. We can't ever let ourselves lose that. Now I know what I have to do. Thank you everyone, we are at half hour. Let's reset for the opening number. Dolly Rebecca, I can sense a mischievous mind. Well I promise you the only thing on my mind is that now that it's showtime, I just wanna spread a little mountain magic. Hmmm. Well that looks good Cheryl Curl thank you, thank you Fancy. I guess I'm as good as I'm gonna get. Okay, thanks. See you at showtime! Dolly, I've never seen you look more beautiful or so at peace. Well thank you for the compliment and I am at peace. Well then that puts me at peace, too. 15 minutes to showtime, 15 minutes. - That's 15. - That's what I heard. Well I need to spend a few of those 15 minutes getting my thoughts together if that's alright. Okay alright, well just holler at me when you're ready to shimmy into this outfit. - Okay, I'll holler. - Okay. Oh! Wait, you need to take this to the band leader. Don't ask me no questions, take that to the band leader, okay? Okay. - Surprise! - Well, Susan! I didn't know you were coming. Well let me just say I needed a little dose of vitamin D. D for Dolly. So I commandeered the corporate jet and here I am. - Good, I'm glad you're here. - Hey, Susan! Wow, what a surprise. - You look terrific! - Well, you know what? It's Dollywood, the minute I walked through those gates all my burdens just disappeared. - Aw. - Well wait 'til you see what Dolly's gonna do for the rest of us. That is my Christmas wish, I hope I get a big gift from you! Oh, you're gonna. Oh, good luck, Dolly and thank you. Well thank you and I just want you to know I really appreciate you. - Oh, I appreciate you! - We both do. I appreciate you, Sam, but Dolly, I really appreciate you. We'll let you get ready. Yeah, I need to. Okay, see you in a bit. - Sam? - Mhmmm. You seem a little tense, what's going on? Oh, nothing, it's good. Yeah smooth, smooth as a Dollywood milkshake. Well speaking of, have you tried a funnel cake? I mean it is a revelation. To be honest with you, I don't really know if it's good for you. I guess they must cook it with a funnel. Oh, I was so sure it would snow. - Dolly Rebecca? - Sam! - How's my beautiful girl? - Oh, I'm excited, I'm getting ready to wish the whole world Merry Christmas. Ain't you glad I ain't wearing that big old hoop skirt? - Oh yeah, why not? - Oh I just got tired of hooting and hollering about it, that was fun though, wasn't it? - So great, God bless you. - Oh, you too, Sam. - Break a leg. - Thank you. Hey, hey you, psst! Come here. Yeah, you. What's your name? Uh, Woody Ms., Ms. Dolly. Ms., Ms. Dolly Parton. Well Woody, I want you to take this and I want you... Okay? - Just trust me. - Oh, okay. Go! Sorry! 'Scuse me! - Hey! - Sorry! Woody! Sorry, Mr. Haskell, sir. It's okay, just watch where you're going next time. - Sorry. - Bless. Okay, places. On your marks, please. Jasmine? Look uh, whatever happens tonight I just want you to know I spoke with my wife and Mary and I would be thrilled to have you join us for Christmas this year. Even after I exploded your budget and cost you all those meal penalties? You've done an amazing job. You should be really proud. Which is all the more reason I can't let you spend another Christmas crying in your popcorn. So come stay with us. We got a family full of kids, and you're great with kids. I am? You're good with kids. Sam, this may be the kindest thing anyone's ever done for me. I'd be happy to come. But I'm still mad about those dancing trees. Who's that guy and what's he doing? Live in 15 seconds. Okay, we're live in 15 seconds. Dolly Parton! You know, I can't come to these mountains without thinking of mom and daddy. I can't sing a song or do a show without thinking of mom and daddy. You know the bible says honor thy father and thy mother. Well I've tried to do that and I hope they'd be proud of me. Now I just wish they'd lived long enough to see all the great things that have happened to me through the years. I thank God, I thank my Uncle Bill who helped me get started. And I most of all thank mom and daddy and I hope that I haven't crammed God or Jesus down anybody's throat, I hate that when it happened to me back then but it 'tis the season. I guess nobody knows for certain if there is a heaven. But if there is, I just hope to hell I go. That sounds just like something my daddy would've said when I used to say things like that as a kid. Old mama would get all over me and daddy would say, "Oh Abby Lee leave that young'un alone, she's just being funny. Don't your bible say a happy heart does good like medicine or something like that?" Well I guess I've just been trying to make your heart smile. And I write a lot of inspirational songs to try and make people think because I do think we need to believe in something bigger than ourselves. Now I believe the kingdom of heaven is within and God is good and God is love. Now who wouldn't wanna believe in that? Did anyone know she rewrote the opening? Everything'll be fine. She's working her mountain magic. * Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm * * When life is good again I'll be a better friend * * A bigger person when life is good again * * More thoughtful than I've been I'll be so different then * * More in the moment when life is good again * * I'll open up my heart * * And let the whole world in * * I'll try to make amends * * When life is good again * * We've been brought to our knees * * We've been so ill at ease * * There are no guarantees * * But you know life goes on this too shall pass away * * Bring new and different days * * We need to change our ways and right our wrongs * * Let's open up our hearts * * and let the whole world in * * Let's try to make amends * * When life is good again * * I'll open up my doors again * * and hear the message in the wind * * Repent of all my sins, hallelujah * * When life is good again * * I'll try to be someone on which you can depend * * A helping hand to lend * * Let's open up our eyes and see what's going on * * If we're to move along from where we've been * * Let's open up our hearts * * And let the love shine in, shine in * * We've all got knees to bend * * And we'll just pray 'til the end * * Ask God's forgiveness when * * life is good again * - Gigi, it's snowing! - It's snowing? * And it's gonna be good again * * It's gonna be, mhmmm, it's gonna be * * It's gonna be good again * * It'll be alright, it'll be alright * * oh God's the reason for all things * * You want rainbows, you get rain * * We'll all be forever changed, forever changed * * I'll sail my boat and fly my kite * * Walk in the park, go out at night * * And hold my loved ones extra tight * * When everything is on the mend * * I'll eat and drink with my old friends * * Sing and play my mandolin do do do do do do * * We'll make it through this long dark night * * Darkness fades when faced with light * * Everything's gonna be alright * * when life is good again * * And it's gonna be good again *
