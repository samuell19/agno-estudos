Oh no! It caught fire! What should I do? No matter how independent women are they still need help from men sometimes. Some men have way too much time on their hands. They gotta do something to kill time. What if I can put their extra strength into service, helping those women in need? That would be brilliant. Okay! I need to set up a website to connect those women who need help with guys who are always lazing around. The rule of this scheme the men cannot be in it for any other purpose or benefit. If the women are satisfied with their services, they can give the men a thank you hug. This website will be called... ALL'S WELL, END'S WELL 2012 Next, we will be presenting the top four awards of the year. And they all go to the same winner. The winner is Carl Tam! Yeah! The awards are for Best Performance, Best Male Singer, Best R&B Song, and the Best Artist in the Asia-Pacific Region Yes, Carl Tam! You deserve these four awards. There you go.

If you knew, you wouldn't have been so harsh. Sponging off? My client has sacrificed so much for love. He married a woman who is 32 years his senior. His mother objected back then. Because even his mom is two years younger than your client. - Two years and eight months, actually. - Never mind. It was his first love. He didn't find a job because of love. He became a laughing stock of his peers. Everything he used and spent came from his wife He did this just because he wanted to concentrate on loving his wife 24/7 He sacrificed his youth. I've made sacrifices too, haven't I? Your youth has long gone! Besides, your reason for divorce is to continue to be in love! Did you know how much it would hurt him? He won't believe in love ever again! The reparation I proposed today is the minimum cost for love! I can never fall in love again. Knock it off!

You think I'm gonna crawl to the other side first? I'm not gonna help. Do it yourself. I have nowhere to go. I have no money or friends. A person like me might as well be dead. Then you shouldn't have followed me home. It was such a mess back there. I didn't even manage to get a bite. I can die, but I can't be hungry Thank you! Please leave after you finish the noodles. Don't worry, I will kill myself once I'm full. Chelsia Song! Be more optimistic, like me! My mission in life is to be optimistic. Just concentrate on Po-sit-ive en-er-gy Go to bed, have a fart, and poof! Everything is fine again You've got a point. I am so tired. Whenever I finish eating, I start dozing off... Hey! What? You promised. I'll take your advice. I think I won't kill myself after I got some sleep. What kind of person is she? Fine, fine! Use the bed. I'll take the sofa. Just for tonight. You leave in the morning. Thank you very much! The bed is so soft! - The pillow is so comfy! - Don't touch my stuff! I didn't! So comfortable! The noodles made me really thirsty. Can you give me some water? I want to die, I'll leave after I finish the noodles. That woman is my boss. Come on in. You're not coming in? - Julie! - Yes? The website sent you this guy. Take off your clothes. Take them off? I need to check if your body is suitable for shooting. I see. A body check, right? That's right, a body check. We can't shoot you if you're too shy I'm not. - Why did you poke me? - Check if it's firm enough Very, very firm! Would you mind not pressing on my nipples? Take off your pants! My pants? You have to be nude. We need to check the whole body. It's all for artistic photography. If you can't do it, then don't. No, no, I can do it. You'll know I'm good once I take off my pants. Excuse me, do you have a changing room? Yes, it's behind the TV. And your underwear too. Where can I hang my underwear? Wherever you like. Sorry, but I just want to make sure. You are not filming pornos, right? We need Japanese girls for pornos. Come out now. Put your hands up. - Calm down. - I am calm. I'm telling my penis to calm down. Move your hands away. I said move them! Relax! Don't be nervous. I'm trying. Mister, lift your head up and listen to the photographer. You can call me by my name. I'm shooting a series of photos on male masculinity. Pose and show me some strength. Move that chair over and sit down. Hold it. Lower the cloth. Don't look at the camera! Now look here. Smile! Don't smile! Smile again! Stop smiling! Why aren't you smiling? When exactly do you want me to smile and look at the camera? You should be able to feel it. Try to feel it. Why aren't you smiling? Be natural, be brave! Good...! All right, that's all for today. You may go now. Already? Yes, put your clothes back on. Yes. Thank you. Okay. Erase that backdrop. - Thank you. - If you weren't satisfied, you... I give you... my telephone number and my working address. You can call me anytime. Jim, get a pen and paper for Mr. Peng. Okay. Mr Peng. This is awkward. Well, the website states that I'd be rewarded with a hug Jim! Thank you so much! This way, please. Master, what do you think? Your model looks good. His advantage is that he's not a pro. But the pictures themselves lack a sense of emotion. I've tried my best. He was too stiff. What could I do? It's not about your skills. Look, he feels nothing for your camera. What should I do then? A normal person would not love a camera, but he would fall in love with the person behind it. I'm only his photographer. How can I make him fall for me? Art is often a manifestation of love. A woman can always make a man fall in love with her. Especially for this type of muscular hunk. You mean, I should flirt with him? Who are you? You are the girl who needs to experience love? Yes, that's me! I'm Charmaine. So you're blind. Yes, I'm visually impaired. Will you refuse to help me because I'm blind? Of course not! I'm not that kind of person. In fact, I'm a very popular novelist in Hong Kong. - My name is Hugo. - Really? It's a pity I can't see you. Can you describe how you look like? Since you can't see, that means you've never seen Takeshi Kaneshiro, right? Then it's hard to explain. Let's put it this way, I'm the kind of guy... that they call a heartthrob. But as an author, it's unfortunate. - Why? - Because... You can never see my face between the lines. It's such a pity that I can't see you. Can I touch you? We've only just met. Take it easy! No, don't get me wrong. I mean, I want to feel your face. My face? All right. Why is your face so different from what people describe as a cute guy? When you are as impossibly handsome as I am, it's hard to be like other people. Charmaine is an orphan. She became blind when she was three. She grew up in the orphanage and is very innocent. She hardly goes out and doesn't know much. But I don't like her spending so much time online, searching for what love feels like. She doesn't know what hurts people the most in this world. It's love! Oops. I can't go on, my heart aches. Are you alright? I'm fine. That's Charmaine's dance teacher, Ms. Ho Pikwan. She's a victim of love. Look at her. I don't mind you seeing other girls. But how come you never take sexy photos of me? - Why? - Edison is such a jerk. But for a woman like her, being with him is quite an achievement. Yeah right, enough about her. Let's talk about me. Charmaine's all grown up now. She'll be getting married. How about you give her the warmth of love and let her bask in it for a bit. But you can't hurt her. Can you do that? Sure! But promise me something. - What? - If she ever asks about my appearance, tell her that I'm ridiculously handsome. Say that you are cute? Okay! No problem! Charmaine? Let's go on a date this Saturday at noon. I'll come pick you up. I will make you feel love's warmth. Great! I'll be waiting here. I'm all nervous just thinking about it I'll dress up tomorrow. Thank you so much! The door's unlocked. I'm swimming on the balcony. Just show yourself in. Okay. You seem to be very wealthy. Why do you need a stand-in daddy? I can't get any actual cash out right now. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to go online to hire a dad for free. Where's your real father then? He died three years ago. You must be lacking fatherly love then. Shut it! I've never needed that kind of thing. But my dad was weird. He set up a will before he passed away. It states that I will only get his legacy if I get married before I turn 25. If not, it'll all go to charity. Isn't that weird? How much is in his legacy? About... five... six... - billion. - Wow! That's a lot! - So, when do you turn 25? - Next week. So you don't have a boyfriend then? It's not like that! Right now, there are three guys who said they love me and want to marry me. I just don't know who to choose. You sure have lots of love going around! Haven't you thought about it? Of course I have! But let's say, I decided to love this guy yesterday. But today I regret it and fall for another guy. Then when I think about it again, the other two aren't bad either... Stop asking! If I knew who I'd marry, I wouldn't need a fake dad to help me. All right! Let's challenge them with three tests. Playing mahjong will tell you their manners, getting them drunk will reveal the truth, and then see how they treat you in bad times. Let's start with mahjong! Here we are! This is my family's ancestral home. Come in. Everybody, this is my father. Introduce yourselves. My name is Rich Junior. I'm a real rich kid, but I don't spend my dad's money. I just spend my mum's. So you didn't make your fortune? I'm Dubya Dung. My dad doesn't have much money, but my grandfather was loaded and left us a small fortune. Wealth doesn't last, my boy. I'm Truman Lan. I'm not wealthy and I have a mortgage. I want to build a fortune myself. Let's hope you make it before you kick it then. I'm going upstairs then. All right, boys. I know you all want to marry my daughter. But our family has a tradition of choosing a son-in-law through mahjong. It's not just me. All our ancestors want to meet you too! Especially the Qing dynasty scholar. He was being ruffed during the game and died in agony. It was a painful death. Let's play! Seven dots! EIGHT DOTS Uncle, I hope you'll win! I know you want this one. Here you are, Uncle - I score! - Wow! - Amazing! - Man, can you even play? Why did you throw that out? No matter how long you stare at the tiles, they'll never change. Just throw one out! I have no clue how to play mahjong So unlike you guys But since the marriage Depends on this game I'm glad to let you score Score! Great Winds! Watching my chips getting less and less And I can tell who the culprit was A mixed or a pure suit hand Great Dragons and Great Winds The king of mahjong Gets the winning hand Hey! Look, who's that? What are you screaming for? I'm Cecilia Chen, didn't you know? Something happened... What happened? The lights went out. Uncle has vanished! We're missing a player. We can't play on. Let's do this another time. Wow, look at the time! I still need to pick my sister up from school. We'll do this again someday. No! You can't leave. The game is on! You have to finish it. Come with me. All my ancestors loved playing mahjong. I'm sure one of them can come replace my dad. Why are you screaming? You're freaking me out! You freaked me out! What do we do? You scared them all off! I should never expect anything for free. They're such cowards. How can they protect you? They all failed the first test! What's going on? What are you doing? Where are you taking me, Mr. Tam? - Thank God your suitcase has good wheels! - What? Get off now. Did you change your mind? Can I stay now? - See you next time! - No! Please don't do that. Where am I supposed to go? What? Please don't... No... Hey! No! Help! Open up! Open up right now! Are you crazy? What did you see? Help! So I can stay, right? Dressing like that is gonna get me killed. Go! What's going on? I'm not going in there! Why are you pushing me in? Are you insane? I am not going in! Don't come out! I missed you! Welcome back... What's wrong? What is it? Are you exhausted? Feeling unhappy? Did you see anything just then? - See what? - Oh, nothing. You're just in a bad mood, right? I really love you! But that's unfair to Alex. Who's Alex? I shouldn't have mentioned him in front of you. But he's been treating me really well this year. He takes every flight that I work on. In first class too! He has so much free time because he gets all his staff to take care of his business. - I'd go if I were you! - So you're saying you have someone else? How dare you blame Alex! I won't stand for it! I really love you so much! Why don't you beg me to stay? Seriously? Don't do it. Make her leave. Then please stay! I can't do that! Alex said he won't wait for me anymore. I have to pack my things and go. - Are you angry with me? - Of course I am angry! I am angry with myself! He's got so much more to give you, and he's treating you so well. Of course you should be with him. Don't be sad that I'm leaving you. I will try my best not to cry, okay? Bye bye... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left you. I've already killed Alex. Please don't be sad. I was just trying to make you laugh. Are you crazy? Or insane? This uniform belongs to my girlfriend. But it fits. No worries. - Take it off! - No! - Take it off! - I won't take it off... - I said take it off! - ...until you laugh! - Take it off! - No! You smile first! She's gone now. Her uniform is all I have. Stop right there! I'm not going anywhere. We're starting our first date now. First dates are very important in a relationship. Yes! I'm getting a bit - nervous now. - Are you? - Yes. - Get in the car. What kind of car do you drive? Since I am so tall, I drive the world's biggest jeep. - Isn't it huge? - Yes... Let me take you somewhere that feels so far away. We're here, mind your step. A few more steps and we've reached Hong Kong's most famous beach for sunsets, Sunny Beach. - It sounds very romantic! - You think so too? Apart from the romantic name, the environment is amazing, just like a paradise. - There's a bird on your right. - No, it's not. It's on my left. Now it's on your right. I'm chasing the bird! Such a lovely Chinese nightingale! Suddenly, a gust of wind is blowing towards us! -Really? I can't feel anything -It's coming... Doesn't it feel nice and cool? Yes! The wind - is so breezy. - Isn't it? Why can I only hear the wind but not the waves? You want to hear some waves? Can you hear that? - There's a big wave! - Yes! The wave's really big! - I want to play in the water too! - No, don't! - Why? - The waves are crashing in! Yes, they are! I'm going to swim for a bit. Be careful, Hugo! The waves are too big! Don't worry, I was on the Hong Kong swimming team and have been in many competitions. Alex Fong was my teammate! Alex Fong? Who is that? Stephy Tang's boyfriend. Give me your hands. What's that? It's sand. The sand is so fine! Thank you so much! There are two hot girls over there! Oh my goodness! Did you see the guy over there? He's so cute and tall! But it seems like his girlfriend is blind. She can't see how handsome her boyfriend is. Why are you crying? I feel so loved! I heard people say that a woman will weep when she feels loved. It's true. I wrote that sentence in seven of my novels. I repeated it seven times. But it's my first time witnessing it. Sorry, I can't hold it in. You'll get used to it. Excuse me, ma'am. I am looking for someone. - You still need to wear a helmet. - Okay. - Beer! - What beer? A beer girl, not local. - She's from... Ger... - Germany? Hi, cutie! Hello! - How can I help you? - I am looking for Peng... Kin! Well, the photos we shot last time were not good enough. I want you to model for me again. Grab some tools. - Yeah! - Tools, tools... - Tools, tools... - There you go! Closer! You look so hot! - Lean on the ladder, please. - Okay. Okay. Now clamp something. Clamp something? Yes, clamp something! Over there! That's hot! I see. Okay. You're so manly! Okay! Come here and climb the stand. Let's make some shots too! You pretend to be the ladder, you get the tools. - Go get the tools. - I will play Kin! You are so cool! No, show me your muscles. - Clamp something! - Clamp what? All right, clamp here. Wow! It's so thick! Why don't you climb a little higher? Work it! Higher! Work it! Higher! Work it more! Make it to the top! Are you all right? I want you to be more wild. Superb! That's wild enough! I can be more wild. I can give you more. He's listening to me now. You can't get away from me! - What is it? - Eat the banana, Tarzan. Why don't I swing again, with the banana? Good! That's not thick enough. It won't look good. Get a thicker one. This one is thick enough. Peng Kin, you deal with it! I am scared too! But you're a man! Have a banana. Stop chatting with it! It's too late now... Run as fast as you can, don't worry about me. Just remember to call... the... police. He looks so cool now. Should I take pictures? Just do it. Be careful, don't let it bite you. - Hold it! - What? This place seems really huge! Where are we? This is my private villa. Whenever I am lonely, I come here to escape the crowd, and to think. It's not huge at all. Just 10,000 square feet or so. I like that it faces the sea. There's a sea horse in the water. Do you... always bring girls here? Never. You're the first one. Would you be my... friend? I'd love... to be your friend. Really? Thank you. I almost forgot to tell you. We're really, really high up, almost high enough to touch the clouds. Really? So when I reach up, - can I touch them? - Of course not! You'd need to fly. But I don't know how to fly. What should I do? I can fly. Let me take you. Ready? One... two... three! I can touch it! - Hugo, let me pick a cloud for you! - What? Don't touch the rain cloud! It's sensitive. If you touch it, it will react and start raining! Why can I hear the rain, but not feel it? I only got two hands. Here we go. - Pouring rain! - It really is pouring! Hugo, Hugo! - Let's go... hurry! - Let's go! Here! Come over and hold onto me. We will be fine if we have an umbrella, right? Strolling in the rain with your loved one is the most romantic thing in the world. Can you feel it? I love this feeling! Don't you think it's all a bit fake though? No, everything feels real to me. When you're in love, everything's real. So you think it's fake? It's getting more and more real. - Okay. Got it. - Director Wang, yes, yes... I've already reserved a penthouse for you on the 108th floor. Actually, it's just about 30 floors. That's the trend... Yes. Okay, please hold. Hey! Mr. Chan. Yes, yes. The one in Tianjin, I held 30% for you. Just over 70 million. Not in Hong Kong dollars, of course. It's in Chinese yuan. You guys aren't even playing pool. Anyway, I'm really happy to see that you guys are doing so well! You think I am happy? I'm not so happy doing this. - Every day and night... - What are you doing? - I know you are rich! - No! Life is so pragmatic and boring when you talk about money all day. Hello? Yes, 200 million. Explain it. I keep tracking the European markets online. My hands shake if I miss a single pill My feet shake if I take more than I should. There's a lot of money in the insurance business, but I woke up crying last night. - No way! - I don't even know what I'm doing! Carl! It's quite painful to live without a dream. I miss the good old days - when we were in a band together. - Yes, yes! Come on... Here we go! "THE GENIUS AND THE MORON" Sing it well! In this world They're smart, silly Sharp, useless, risky And plain dumb guys Assholes, holiness, traitors Crazies, idiots, Who are worse than dandies Crooks, smart-asses, cuties Gangsters and kids Who always mess around So why you still make babies? Who's the genius? Genius! Who's the moron? Moron? Act stupid or a real dumb-ass Dumb-ass -It's not easy to tell -No one really knows Genius or moron? Who knows? Genius or moron? No one really knows Genius or... Moron? What's that you said again? That you were like a lifeless corpse? You sound like a stupid poet! At least I was better than him. Woke up crying in the middle of the night? I was trying so hard not to laugh I almost bit my tongue! You want me to say that I have lots of money, properties, and women, that I just don't like music anymore? Music is for kids! When you grow up, you're supposed to be into money Dreams are so... so immature! Beside, his look is so old-fashioned! But Carl's a good guy, Are you guys done? Yeah. Done. In this world, They're smart, silly, sharp... My boyfriend has come back. I'm leaving now. Thank you so much! Don't go. He beats you. Why are you going back to him? If a man gives you a hundred thousand a month, it's fine for him to beat me up from time to time. Sometimes he buys me something after he beats me. I even provoke him to do it when I want a designer clutch! Last time he threw me out, I had nothing with me. So I spent a couple of days here. What's wrong with you? Don't you have principles to live by? What kind of woman are you? I'm a female singer who knows nothing. I can't even sing in the right key. When I was young, I was a pop idol. I used my looks. I am lazy too. I go to sleep after I eat. I just don't want to do anything at all! Chelsia, don't you have dreams? Don't you have dreams? I have a dream. We're singers! - We have a passion! - Dreams? Those are long gone. Look at your clothes! Do you think it's still the 80s? You just refuse to accept reality! Bye. Could you stay? I really don't want to be alone tonight. Could you stay with me? Hey! This suitcase has legs! It just walked back in! I will leave if you don't smile! DEPARTURE (NORTH) - I know. - Take care. There are all sorts of people out there. Don't forget us. Carmen, I just wanna see you off. What are you doing? Why are you here? Daddy just wanted to see you before you leave. - Just a minute or two. - Even a second is too much for me. I don't want a father like you. I don't want a lawyer father who can legally omit alimony from a divorce. I don't need a father who haggles over every penny for his daughter. Do you know what I fear the most? I don't what to be as ruthless and selfish as you! You're a lawyer! Isn't debating your strong suit? Defend yourself! In Hong Kong, I can have you followed and see you. But once you're overseas, I can't do anything. - So... - Just go. Mom's coming back soon. She'll go crazy if she sees you. Go! Leave now! Piss off! - Calm down. - Don't be angry! Piss off! Leave! Don't be mad, calm down. Were you stalking me? So you saw everything! That's okay, it'll be alright. When I left for school, I really wanted my dad to see me off. She may not understand now, but she'll regret it when you die. Just kidding! Don't be mad! Not all's lost. You've got me as your stand-in daughter. - Right? - Yes, right. So, you said that no woman would have - a feeling of love when they are with me. - I did! Well, you're wrong! There is a woman falling for me, and she is... tall and beautiful. She must be blind then! Nonsense! If not, invite her to join us at the next authors' dinner gathering. I'd like to introduce you to my girlfriend, Charmaine Tam. At two o'clock. This is Mr. Wong, Hong Kong's comics emperor. - Hello. - Hello. On your right, is the chief editor of our publishing house, - Miss Lo. - Hello! The one right in front of you. Yes, this one, is the detective story novelist, - Mr. Feng. - Hello, Miss Tam. At six o'clock, my best friend, Shing. He's a ghost story writer. - Hello. - His stories have scared people to death. - Hello. - At eleven o'clock, the most stunning poet in Hong Kong, Miss Blanche. - Hello. - Hello. Let's raise a toast to Hugo for having such a beautiful girlfriend. Sure! Cheers! Wait! You can drink mine, and I'll drink yours, like newlyweds! You guys should try it too. It's fun. Cheers! Be honest, Charmaine, what do you like about Hugo? I... I admire his talent. He's handsome and so romantic! I need to add one thing. Love really can be blind. That's pretty blind though. Have we been exposed? Impossible, they're as dumb as a bag of rocks. Here comes the food! I heard that their appetizers are really good. Everyone, please enjoy. Wait, wait! You want me to feed you again, right? - Yes. - Very well then. Let me give you a tomato. I'm reaching over now. Open your mouth. Yes, isn't that good? It's your turn now, alright? Here, hold on to this. I'm going to take a bite now. I'm going to eat it now. Oops. We don't use forks at home. We feed each other with our mouths. Let's try again. One, two, three! One, two... Oh! One, two, three! Ouch! Hugo! Are you all right? Stop touching my face like that! Everyone will know you're blind! I'm sorry! I was so nervous! This is so embarrassing! I am sorry. I knew that I'm not good enough for you. I knew it all along. I am sorry. I am so, so sorry. Hugo, we really don't mind that your girl is visually impaired. Actually, you're the only one who can't let it go! Wouldn't it be dangerous for a blind girl to walk out on her own? Yes, it would. EXCHANGE TOWER Charmaine! Watch out! I am sorry. It's me who should be sorry. - I shouldn't have... - I shouldn't have blamed you. I'm the one who's blind. But not my eyes. I was blinded inside. I am sorry. Excuse me! Are you guys done? Why don't you apologize to me? Dashing across the road like that. Are you blind? Yes, I am blind. But it doesn't mean that I can't dash across the road! - What are you doing! - I'm doing it now! - So what? - What? - I'm jaywalking! - Hey! Stop hitting my car! I'm getting out. And I know kung fu! Gentlemen, sorry for scaring you off last time. That's why I invited you here tonight. Let me make it up to you. Bottoms up! Why don't you strip off my pants? Here comes the highlight for tonight! I regret that I'm not wearing my 3D glasses right now! You are so bad! Boss. It's so 3D! So it's true what they say about men! They all become assholes after a couple of drinks. Yeah, look who's in trouble! You are just the same! Fooling around. I don't want to see you guys again! Hey! Cecilia! Don't go! Help me out! Don't go! Ouch! Hey, you came too early! They're not here yet! Go back and hit her again. Again? Geez, just don't jaywalk if you are blind! It's for those who can see! Ouch... Ouch! I guess it's not blindness. Women are the real problem! Oh no! We've got to call the police. Call the ambulance! Hello? Is this Emergencies? There's been an accident here! Can I speak to her family, please? You guys are not her family yet. Doctor, how is my daughter? She's not looking good. She's suffered a massive collision and friction, which tore off the skin on her face. Some parts of the dermis are completely destroyed. And all her facial bones are fractured. Her nasal bone has collapsed, causing her to lose control of all her facial muscles, her features are all dislocated. That's what we call... Sad-but-true- she-cannot-control-her-face-itis. Doctor, can you put it in simple terms? Simply put, she's completely disfigured. Disfigured? It's all my fault. It was my stupid idea that got you hurt. I'm so sorry, my fake daughter. I'm sorry. But don't worry, I will get you the best treatment. If they can't treat you here, I'll take you overseas. If no one marries you, this stand-in dad will take care of you forever. I will treat you like my own daughter. Since my own daughter doesn't want me anyway... I wish it was me who had got hit! Hey! Stand-in dad! I thought you were her father! Take her back. Thank goodness you're okay! You scared me! I'm fine. You should have told me earlier. I'm not okay! Look... It hurts a lot here. I might even get a scar. Are you crying? Don't be silly. Why would I cry? My own dad never cared about me this much. Don't wipe your tears! It's much more convincing if you go out looking like that. - How's Cecilia? - How is she? - Is she all right? - There's good news and bad news. - Which one do you like to hear first? - The bad one first. The bad news is... Cecilia is disfigured. Her entire face is destroyed. And the good news? The good news is that... you guys still love her so much. Take this and pose with it. Dragon boat racing? Go on! Okay. Where should I go? Stand next to the boat. Show me how you flirt with girls. What kind of expression is that? This one is... you're mine! And this one is... you're mine too! What's the difference? This one means I want her right now. That one means I want her all the time. This one's for when I'm free. This one, I'll get her back again. All right, stop getting girls now. Get into the water Be cool. That's not how to row. Make some splashes! - Like this? - That's right! Is that all right? We're done for today. Let's pack up and go. I want you ask you guys something. - Yes? - I want to buy a gift for a girl. Do you guys have any good suggestions? It depends if you've... slept together before. How come? If you haven't, get her something suggestive, to suggest that you want her, right? If you have... then you should buy something as compensation. Because you took something from her, right? You must compensate her. - Right! - That's reasonable! All right then! I'll need something suggestive. And I should buy the compensation too! - Wow! He's very confident. - He's so greedy. I also want to write her a card to express my love for her. Any suggestions? I love you so damn frigging much! I prefer something more subtle. More subtle? It's something above friendship, so that's super. So write... "Super friends forever!" This one is perfect! So meaningful. Great! SUPER FRIENDS FOREVER "HOLLAND KIN" Sir, please use the cargo lift for deliveries. Have you ever seen a delivery man wearing a suit? I'm a guest. Could you please hold this for me? Where is Miss Sun's table? Miss Sun has arrived. This way, please. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Let me put this down first. - Sure. - Thank you. - You've planned your outfit. Are you hot? What would you like to have? Right now, I don't need you. If I need you, I will call you. Okay? I can pour the champagne myself, thanks. What's that gigantic thing? It's a present for you. Go and open it! Why are you giving me a mattress? It's a suggestive gift. What does it suggest? If I tell you, it won't be suggestive. Let's go and have a seat. Please again. But I don't really get what you mean! Is it that difficult? Why don't you open the next present? I think it will help you understand. This one is compensation. I should give it to you tomorrow morning. But I might as well give it to you now. Isn't it beautiful? It took me so long to pick this. I think it is very meaningful. Besides, gold is precious. Should be enough to compensate you. What are you compensating for? Actually, I want to take something from you, but we'll both be happy during the process. But afterwards you'll feel like you've lost something. Well, in fact, you won't really lose anything. So I bought you this to make it up to you and make you feel better. So that I can keep getting things from you. I guess I've made it a lot clearer this way. I'm completely lost. Read this card, and you might understand it better. MY JULIE, SUPER FRIENDS FOREVER HOLLAND KIN - I'm sort of getting it now. - Are you? Just don't explain it any further. Actually, what do you think about me? Do you think we can bring our friendship up to the "Super" level? Let me help you with that. You're a nice guy. - I'm serious. - Really? But I think you can try to... upgrade yourself? So that we can communicate more easily and can bridge the gap between us. I like bridging gaps! Come on, cheers! Chelsia Song! Put your laziness on hold! Put some effort into your life! No, I just want to eat and sleep. - I don't like working. - No! There's a huge concert coming up! They're looking for lead singers! This is our chance! Yeah! Great. Go by yourself. No! They are looking for male and female singers! I'm already way past... my twenties. I'm not a spring chicken anymore, plus people still recognize me! What if I don't get in? You're afraid of the stage because you fell off it. Stand up again on this stage! You make a very good point. You've inspired me! I have decided that... I won't try to get up anymore. Slow down! You can do it! I have faith in you! You're almost there! You're killing me! Why don't you get out and run? Hey! Wait! - I'm exhausted. - You can do it. I have faith in you. I need to take a nap too... and catch my breath. Slow down! Can you just slow down? - Ouch... - Ouch... - You... - Help... You can sit on the sofa for a while. We'll have someone collect it later. Now you see this. I'm bankrupt! And Ceci's ended up like this. But luckily, you all still love her. Whoever is willing to offer three million dollars to pay her recovery operations will get my permission to marry her. Of course! Three million? That's nothing. Even if it's 30 billion US dollars, I will just make a call and have the money sent here. Let's see... The cutting's pretty nice. But I can't accept a woman who's had plastic surgery. Plus three million dollars isn't enough to fix the whole thing, is it? It's time for me... to make a sad but selfless decision. I need to leave my love. Don't beg me to stay. I'll leave in pain. See you, Uncle! You are the best! You've stayed! Uncle, you're stepping on my shoe. Oh, I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry, Uncle. I'm really sorry. You're leaving too? They are all gone! You... It's your fault! You and your silly tests. All the guys have gone! What do I do? You should thank me! If not, you wouldn't know that not one of them is reliable. I can't get married. How do I get my legacy now? All right, all right! We'll figure something out! What should I do...? Stand-in Dad, how about this? We can get married and then get divorced after we get the money. Don't be silly! You are my daughter! How can we get married? Uncle, I've just remortgaged my house with the bank. Here's a check for three million dollars. I don't care if your face can be fixed or not. I just want to be with you I hope you can accept me. I thought you'd given up on me. I have no clue on how to give up on you 'Cause I'm determined to be with you She's gorgeous! The bride and groom may exchange their vows. I call upon everyone here to witness that I, Cecilia Chen, take you, Truman Lan, to be my lawfully wedded husband. I call upon everyone here to witness that I, Truman Lan, take you, Cecilia Chen, to be my lawfully wedded wife. Very well then. Cecilia? Since you married before your 25th birthday, As your late father's attorney, I hereby confirm that you've met the requirements for inheriting your father's legacy. In the sum of six billion dollars. Six billion dollars? Three million became six billion? I should have gone for it! I'll give you 500,000 for your brows. You'd better give us a couple of million each. I have no clue on how to give up either! Uncle, when did you die? Cecilia, who is this guy? I'm not Cecilia's real father. I'm just a substitute helping her to choose the right guy. What? Ceci, I want to thank you. I never really knew how to be a good father. You gave me the chance to do it right for once. Though you're not my real daughter, I feel like I've been a real dad to you. I'm really happy I spent this time with you. Now my job is done. It's time for me to go. My fake daughter, bye bye. Dad! Dad! I still owe you a hug. I don't want you to go. I don't want you to be my stand-in dad. I want you to be my real dad. All right, all right! It's okay, Daughter. Dad, I think I should call you Dad too. - Dad, let's take a picture! - Ready? One, two, three! Don't forget me! Kin! Kin! There's a letter for you. MAN, STRENGTH BY JULIE SUN She invited me to her photography exhibition! Wow! Leading male model! As your bros, we'll support you! Don't worry, we'll go with you. - We won't make you feel embarrassed. - Yeah, we won't embarrass you. - All right! - Great! Wow! That's a huge Kin! That's a huge Kin! Remember, when we go in, don't embarrass yourselves, alright? Such strength! Wow! There are so many Kins! - So many Kins! - This one is so cool! - This one's different. - What does it say? - Strength! - Strength? So powerful! - Kin! - Grab a few more. There's many other poses inside. - Take two of those. - Let's go inside. Wow! Look! Kin! This way! You look so cool! You didn't... you didn't take a shower? It's mud. No touching, all right? - That one has oil on him! - Be quiet! It's Kin and his spanner. Look, there's food! So much to see and eat! - Strike a pose. - This one is... - Hi! - You made it! -I'm happy -That's all it takes to make you happy? I bet you'll be thrilled later. Kin, you gotta do it like you mean it. Kneel. I thought about it. You told me to be a man. I should tell you how I feel! What are you doing? I don't think he gets it. Explain it to him. Who the heck are you? I'm her mentor, a.k.a. the best photographer in the universe, Shalala. What's wrong with you? I wanted you to throw yourself into this project. So at the beginning... I did flirt with you on purpose. But it's just a photography skill. And the results were great. I don't get it. Let me help explain this. It was me, who told her to make you fall in love with her, temporarily. Just like actors do in movies. Once the filming's done, you're yourself again. - I see. - That's it. - Wait... - No. My mistake. I misunderstood her. Hold on. You're not going to be with Kin, because it's all his infatuation? Even an idiot like him can tell. I should've got it long ago. Why would an elegant photographer like you fall for me? What you needed from me... was just... my infatuation and my goofiness. This exhibition, is a public display of my stupidity. To let the whole world know how stupid I am! And I thought it was real. I am sorry. I've had experiences like this before too. I took pictures of some dogs about ten years ago. I had to keep telling them Just keep praising them. One of them became my pet. Are you saying I'm a dog? No, I didn't mean that at all. But if you were one, I wouldn't mind taking you home. Kin, we are from two different worlds. We can never be together. I remember when we were shooting at the site. You told me to climb higher and higher. But I fell anyway. But today, I understand that no matter how hard I try, I'll never reach you. And this time, I've fallen hard. I just want to know, did you at any point when you were shooting me... have even a little, just a little feeling for me? You're overthinking it. I think so too. Maybe it's not that he read into it too much. Maybe you just haven't even started reading. This is their territory. We can't do anything. We should just go back to our territory. Kin! Stop following me! We all chase dreams In dreams our ways get lost Our mirths are ephemeral And we can't tell here from beyond Our lives resemble dreams In dreams our fates get changed Our pains are unbearable But we can't have joy without pain We all have gifts We shall find our places Spread our wings and soar And fly beyond our dreams You know, this sunset is so incredible. Unfortunately, you can't see it. No, I can see it very soon! They finally found me a cornea match! I can get a transplant really soon and see again! Promise me, once the operation is done, you'll be the first person I see when I open my eyes. Do you speak Japanese? Why?! WHY!? Why chase a dream? Good, okay. Hugo! At last I can see you! - You're not Hugo... - Miss Tam. Actually, after a patient recovers from an operation, the first person they see isn't the one they want to see most. It should be the doctor who removes their bandages. Congratulations! Charmaine... I'm so happy that you can finally see! Do you recognize me? Yes, you're the director of the orphanage. I know your voice! - Excellent! - Director, where's Hugo? Hugo? Hugo! I can feel you. I recognize your scent. You must be him! Stop acting dumb, I'm sure it's you! Hugo! Hugo! The truth will always reveal itself. Especially when you only have toilet paper to cover it. Peng Kin! - Peng Kin! Please don't go! - Leave me alone! You've hurt me enough! I've tried so hard to climb up to you that you've given me acrophobia! It's not ideal for a construction worker. The worst thing is, I don't dare to speak in English anymore All my confidence is gone! Don't go! I have something to tell you! Hugo! Stop right there! If you're not Hugo, why are you running away? Hugo! Stop! I really have something to tell you! I said I am not Hugo! Why don't you believe me? You are lying! I can recognize your voice, your scent, and the feeling of love. Stop lying to me! - Peng Kin! Wait! - Hugo! Peng Kin! Hugo! Hugo! Hugo! Peng Kin! Hugo! Stop! - Are you being chased by a woman too? - Yes! I'm not surprised. You're handsome. But even you have woman chasing you! Is she blind? - How did you know? - What? She was blind, but she can see now! I'm afraid to show her my face. Then you'd better be... be careful! If she sees your face, she'll scream and run. - How did you know I'm Hugo? - What? Hugo! Sorry, ma'am. Can I speak first? Peng Kin, when I was shooting you, I tried everything to make you fall in love with my camera. But it turned out that the person behind the camera... fell for you too. What kind of camera is that? What's the aperture? What's the size? Who are you? I'm not talking to you! He's Hugo! All right! Can you let me finish first? Yeah, let her finish. Peng Kin, you said you look stupid in my photos because you like me. But I was as stupid as you were. And I'd never seen... this stupid side of me. I didn't realize that... I'm in love with you too! Hugo! I just want to say... Thank you so much for showing me what it's like to be in love. However... I don't want this to end. I want to be with you! Are you getting goosebumps? Yes! But she won't be able to stand my ugly face! That's easy. You want to end this, right? Just go out now. When she sees your face, she'll run for her life. Man, you've got a point. - So be it, then. - Just go and be it! Charmaine... I never was good enough to be your Hugo. Your Hugo should at least look like this. Hugo! You look awful! What did you just say? Let me tell you, my favorite person is... Holland Kin. My hobby is to take photos with you and drink beer. - Bbobbo Haejwo. - What does that mean? It's Korean. It means "Give me a kiss." Actually, you look exactly the same as the Hugo I imagined. You are as cool and handsome as him! Really? I've always believed that I'm handsome too! But those who are jealous of me always want to bring me down. Have you noticed that they're giving us strange looks? They're all really young. We're the oldest people here. Not old. We're mature. Mature means that we are experienced. You're up. You can go in now. Next up, we have a duo called Post 90s. With Carl Tam and Chelsia Song. Chelsia Song? Chelsia! You're here for the audition too? What are you trying to prove? That you can rise from the dead? Isn't she the other member of Sweet Virgins? Hey! I am Teresa! We've met before, - Remember? - I recognize her too! She used to be really hot! Really? She's still fit now! I listened to your songs in high school. Sweet Virgins, right? I know the other one. Carl Tam, isn't it? Hi! Your band was called Moment, right? - I've played your songs. - Hello! I've heard that your group is called Post 90s. Why's that? Adding both of your ages? It means we debuted in the post-90s! Enough talking. Let's go... We can't leave at this point! Sorry, Carl. I really can't do this. I've tried so hard to get you here. If you give up, it'll all go to waste. Listen up. If we're having a low tide in life, we want to be the lowest ones! - Your tide is out. - Chelsia! Chelsia! Help! I can't do this! That's so typical of her. She's always running away. She'll never change. Hey! It's just you now. Are you still going to sing? Sure! My friend How are you these days It's so precious that we can sing together I can't explain it But your friendship gives me passion MS. TERESA CARPIO Many people see me... as a failure. It's simple to avoid failure. If I don't want to fail, I could just give up. That way, you can't fail again. But I won't give up. You may say that I'm stupid or crazy. I am stupid. I'm stupidly in love with what I do. I'm really grateful to her. She dreamed along with me during this time. It's okay if she's not brave enough to come back on stage. But on my stage... she'll always my best leading actress. Chelsia Song! This song is for you! The years fly by With all the highs and lows We fight our own wars But our hearts are always connected It's so fortunate that we meet again Even if we have Parted before Really happy to see you again My heart is filled with joy Forgive me if I cry from happiness Whatever happens tomorrow Rain or shine, I'll sing this song With my head held high I can't explain it But your friendship gives me passion The years fly by With all the highs and lows We fight our own wars But our hearts are always connected Your friendship always stands by me You alone warm my heart No one can put out This fire of The thousand Blazing suns! Singing is all about touching people's hearts. I am so moved by you. Yet, we can't let you go through. - Why? - Yeah, why? Because you're not suitable for this musical! The leading roles of this musical are teens. The flyers didn't say a thing! It's obvious enough. It's called The Teens Musical. It's about young kids in high school. You are way too old for it! Isn't this for The Spring Palace? That's in the studio next door. But you two are awesome. They'll surely choose you. Hurry up! You should still make it. - Let's go. - Can we make it? Hurry, there's no time! Chelsia Song! I'm sorry about what happened in the past. I've forgot all that already. Come on! Come on! Listen up! Stop licking! You can do that later. - Bye! - Break a leg! Whatever Project BaoXi turns out to be, I'd love to see these couples hugging each other tightly. I started this website because you left me. I wanted to change the other men. I never expected that I'd change you as well. I am sorry. Could we start over, my love? Don't ask me. Go ask your daughter. Everyone is enjoying themselves. Why don't we hug it out too? Kung Hei Fat Choi! We wish everyone all the best in the Year of the Dragon! And good health to you all! Kung Hei! Kung Hei! Ouch! Help! Don't embarrass yourselves, okay? - Chelsia Wong... - Oh!

Breath in! What are you looking at? You are blocking the camera! I can explain this... What's wrong with you guys? What's wrong with you? I am Mark Six!
