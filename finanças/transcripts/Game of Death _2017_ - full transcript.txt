Hey, bro, Ashley wants to fuck you. Get the fuck over here. Tell Ashley I'm flattered. I'm coming soon. So you're fucking Tom. Who are you marrying and who are you killing? Uh, I'd kill Beth... and marry Kenny. What? Fucking rights, homie. [KISSING] I smoked crack on metro with the homeless people. WOMAN: Who do we have here? It's Mary-Ann. [CHUCKLING] [ASHLEY CHUCKLING] - Ready? - All right, get off me. - Oh, you love it. - [CHUCKLES] Hey, Matt. Your girlfriend wants to fuck my brother. I don't care. It'd be the only way you can get him off anyways. - Ha-ha. - KENNY: And, dude? - Ash wants to marry me. - So? What makes you think I want to marry this bitch? What makes you think I wanna marry you, bitch? [CHUCKLES] Oh, you want to marry me. "So, Matt... What do you do for a living?" Well, it's pretty fuckin' easy. The good life, bitches. - WOMAN 1: You need to be alone. - WOMAN 2: It's his pool. What am I supposed to do? Not have sex in it? That's ridiculous. [CHUCKLING] No, let's get fucked up on acid and all trip out together, it will be beautiful. WOMAN: With Tyler around? Definitely not. - [SCOFFS] He's not that bad. - WOMAN: Really, Ash? He's pretty terrible. ASHLEY: No, but, you know, for a drug dealer, he could be way sketchier. Tyler, my man. Waddup? How's it goin'? Who wants to have some fun? KENNY: Of course. TYLER: You know I gotcha. Best in the business, right here. Yo, what are you doing putting that in your drink, bro? I told you, you're wasted that way. BOTH: Rock, paper, scissors! Ah, man, you fucking suck at this game. You fucking suck at life. Well, you win some, you lose some. Is this piss, man? [LAUGHS] You drank my piss. Woah, watch out. You're next on my kill list, buddy. MATT: Look, I just got this done, man. I'm not supposed to get it wet. Did you guys know that manatees could live up to 65 years? They're like the potatoes of the ocean. My uncle hit one with his boat one time, boat was a mess. Oh, my God. My brother. - [LAUGHS] - Where is he by the way? I don't know. Probably masturbating somewhere. Isn't that what he's always doing? Yeah, always jerking off. It's crazy. He and Matt are probably circle jerking. WOMAN 1: Uh-oh. WOMAN 2: Tom's in love with his sister. WOMAN 1: Oh! Shit! [INDISTINCT] All right, you want it right, kind of, in between... Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. ...your shoulder and your torso. - Okay. - Just a little bit more to the right. - Okay. - Okay. - [SHOOTS] - Oh, fuck! No, that was good, that was good. - It'll be okay. - I can't just get it touched up! You could just get it touched up! - That's how tattoos work. - Babe, give me a towel. No, bitch. You're on your own. - MATT: Fuck! - MAN: Why does he need one? MATT: You're fucking useless. [WOMAN LAUGHING] ASHLEY: Look at this statue. MATT: Look at her nipples. ASHLEY: Why did your gran have a doll? [LAUGHS] MATT: I don't know, man. Okay, you think this was a hat back then - or something? [LAUGHS] - [ASHLEY LAUGHS] - You're so funny. - [BOTH LAUGH] [KISSING] Ooh. Can I eat this? You can eat whatever you want, bitch. Aww, thanks, bitch. MATT: Sit on my face. [ASHLEY EXCLAIMS] Wherever this lands... that person must give a lap dance to whomever they choose. MAN: I like this. [EXHALES] [MOANS] [EXHALES] [MOANS] This is so fucking lit. I so don't get it. Take some lessons. Might help you out. [EXHALES] [MOANS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] WOMAN: Is this just his money stash? You know, I'm sure if we tear the walls down, there will be like, a shit-ton of cash. WOMAN: Ooh, let's do that. MATT: All right. I think I got this. [CLEARS THROAT] Okay. So... "With the clock ticking, "is life worth living? "Make a choice. "You or I. "Without decision, "one will die. "In this quest, some are left behind. "This game will blow your mind." [ALL CHUCKLE] Has anyone ever played? Wait a minute. Is it gonna be one of those never-ending games like that Risk shit we played last time? 'Cause I'm not taking another night of that shit. ASHLEY: Just keep reading, babe. - MATT: Okay. - ASHLEY: How do we play? [MATT CLEARS THROAT] So... Everyone put their finger on one of the skulls. Then, when ready, you press the start button. Seriously, guys, are we playing or not? [MARY-ANN LAUGHS] Come on, Tyler. You in? All right. Like I'm afraid to die anyways. Maybe you should be. [ALL CHUCKLE] "The game of death starts when the counter stops "at the number of kills that are needed to win." All right. Let's do this shit. [TIMER TICKING] [GAME WHIRS] [MAN GROANS] - [ALL EXCLAIM] - Yo, what the fuck, man! - What the fuck was that? - Gross. It took our blood. [CHUCKLES] TYLER: Fuck! No, no, no, bro. That's fucking... [GAME WHIRS] [TIMER TICKING] That's just not even a game. That's a fuckin' STD dispenser, bro. Hep C, AIDS... Don't worry, Tyler. You can't get AIDS twice. Oh, fuck, you think this is funny? ASHLEY: Dude, it's a scratch from an old board game. At worst, you need a Band-Aid. Know that for sure, huh? [GAME CLICKING] Do you hear that? Oh, creepy. "If nobody is killed by the time the clock runs out, "the game will, in turn, "execute a player. "It is you against them, "but it is also you against yourself. "Make your choice wisely. "The game ends when the counter is down to zero "or when all the players are dead. "Beware. Once the game starts, you cannot quit. "Kill or be killed. "Death is the only way out." Who gives a shit about the rules, Beth? All right? I'm not about to play a game that just fucking bled me. For all we know, every single person in this room by now has fuckin' AIDS. All right. So, I don't get it, we need to kill 24 people to end the game? Yeah, it doesn't make sense. There's gotta be missing cards or dice or something, right? I swear, man, I'm telling you, I can feel it burn into my fucking veins, bro! MARY-ANN: Calm down, Tyler. Hey, I know my shit, all right, Mary-Ann? I bet you it's some sorta government issue conspiracy, Cold War, 9/11 reptilian type of shit, man. That's not even a thing, Tyler. TYLER: Oh, you better fucking believe it's a thing. They kill presidents like this all the fucking time! Dude, what the fuck are you talking about, man? Buddy, if you're that fuckin' upset, just go to the fucking hospital. TYLER: So they can experiment on me? Fucking idiot. I need some fresh air. So who do we kill first? I say we kill Kenny. [ASHLEY AND MATT CHUCKLE] - Oh, Kenny. - Uh-uh. - I don't like that idea. - [CHUCKLES] So what do we do? - Beer bong? - KENNY: Yeah, man. - All right. - KENNY: Where is it? - MATT: You ready, babe? - ASHLEY: I'm always ready. - [MAN CHUCKLES] - MATT: Yeah, you say that now. ASHLEY: Yeah, let's do this. Oh, you think you're so smart. MAN: Okay, ready? - WOMAN: Come on, Ash. - ASHLEY: Let's do this. ALL: Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! - WOMAN: Yeah, Ashley! - MAN: Yeah! That's it. MATT: All right, I'm next, I'm next. - ASHLEY: Thank you! - MATT: Well done, bitch. ASHLEY: Thanks, bitch. MATT: You did good for a girl. - WOMAN 1: Oh! - WOMAN 2: Excuse you? MATT: Yeah, for a girl, she did all right for a girl. ASHLEY: Oh, I did all right for a girl, did I? - MATT: Yeah, yeah. - ASHLEY: Oh, that's cute. So you're gonna... you're gonna do better? MATT: Yeah, I am. So pay attention. ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. Let's pay attention! - WOMAN: Okay. - MATT: It's all about form. - ASHLEY: Hmm, is it? - MATT: Yeah. - ASHLEY: Is it? - MATT: One knee down. Not two. You're not sucking a guy off. ASHLEY: Yeah, never again. - MATT: Fuck off! - ASHLEY: That's what you get. MATT: Mary-Ann, pay attention. You're next. MARY-ANN: Yeah, and I'm gonna show you up. MATT: Yeah, okay. ASHLEY: Pay attention to this douche bag. MATT: Yeah, you gotta stretch. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - MATT: Beer me. - ASHLEY: Limber up for it. - MATT: All right. - KENNY: Ready? - MATT: Pay attention. KENNY: Drink! Get her all in. - WOMAN: Drink! Drink! - KENNY: Get it down. - Get it in! Get it in! - WOMAN: Chug! Chug! - Chug! - KENNY: Yeah! - [MATT COUGHS] - [ALL LAUGH] KENNY: Spitters are quitters, buddy. - [MATT GASPS] - KENNY: She is it. - ASHLEY: I was good for a girl. - MATT: What the fuck is this? KENNY: I told you you were next on my kill list, bud. [ASHLEY LAUGHS] Oh, and that's how it's done. KENNY: Every alcoholic takes this position. [ALL LAUGHING] ASHLEY: I think now we really showed you. KENNY: Get up, man. Jesus, stop being a pussy. - [MATT PANTS] - Matt, man, you're okay. MATT: No, I'm not fucking okay, what did you put in this? KENNY: Hot sauce, man. Hot sauce. - ASHLEY: Matt, baby... - MATT: Fuck, get off me! TYLER: Yo, calm the fuck down. - Take it easy. - Tyler, shut the fuck up. Kenny, this isn't funny. KENNY: This isn't my fault. Should I call someone? [GROANS] What the fuck! Matt, babe? He's gonna hurl. [SCREAMING] Rope it in, fuck, man! [EXCLAIMS] What the fuck! - [WHIMPERS] - [SCREAMS] [WHIRS] One down. [CACKLES] BETH: You hear that? - TOM: Yeah. - BETH: It's moving. TOM: One down. BETH: How weird. [SCREAMS] TYLER: Come on, inside, get inside. Everybody! Kenny! - Get inside. - [WOMEN CRYING] MARY-ANN: Oh, my God, Kenny! TYLER: Kenny, get inside, come on! - Come on! - [CRYING] Get the fuck inside. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. Come on. Let's go. Go! Go! Go! Go! - TYLER: Kenny! - Come on, come on, go inside! TYLER: Kenny! Get down, get down, get down! - TOM: What's going on? - Get down! They're shooting, and they got Matt. They got fucking Matt, bro. [SCREAMING] - Matt... - TYLER: Kenny, hold her! Don't let her go outside! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] KENNY: Get down, get down! TYLER: They're fucking shooting us, they got Matt. Get down, get down, get down! Get the fuck down! Not in the window! [ALL CRYING] There was nobody there, man. Yes, there was! There was a fucking gunshot, all right? [ASHLEY CRYING] Did you hear the gun? Did you see anyone? He was shot, man. Was it a sniper? KENNY: No, there was nobody there, man. TYLER: Yes, there was. It was a fucking gunshot. I heard it myself. Oh, hold on. - Jesus! - ASHLEY: I don't know. I didn't see clearly. Hello? Yes, hi. Please just help us! There is a shooter outside. He's shooting us. [CRYING] MARY-ANN: He shot someone already. - I think he's dead. - His fucking head is gone! There's six of us. We don't know. Just please hurry! KENNY: He's headless. MARY-ANN: We're fucking scared. Ash, what's the address? 50 something... 50... 55... 55 Riverside. Just please hurry! [KNOCK ON DOOR] What the fuck is that? Where the fuck did you get that? TOM: It's mine. [ASHLEY SOBS] Put the gun down. And die? [KNOCKING CONTINUES] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - MAN: What the hell? - TOM: Shut the fuck up. [WOMEN PANTING] Who are you? And where the fuck is your gun, huh? What gun? I don't have a gun! Come on, come on, man. Don't fucking lie to me, man. You just killed our fucking friend out there. We've got him! We've got him! What do you mean "hang tight"? How much longer will you be? It's that creep that was staring at me today. Who the fuck else is with you, huh? MAN: I don't understand. TOM: Where the fuck is that gun? [SHOUTS] Why did you kill him? MAN: I heard screaming, and I came over to see if you were okay. He's lying. He's a fucking sketchy pedophile. Guys, he doesn't even have a gun. I don't have a gun. Please! TYLER: No, fuck him, man. He probably has us surrounded by now. Like some alien agent or something. Hey, check this fuck for a third eyelid, man. - MAN: What? - I said blink, motherfucker! - We're all gonna die. - TYLER: Why did you do it? MAN: Do what? You shouldn't have come here. You think we're just gonna let you kill our friend, - and do nothing? - Is that what you think? I didn't kill anyone! Okay, guys. Guys, enough. Just... just wait for the cops to get here. Please don't kill me. - KENNY: Oh, man! - You're not going anywhere. KENNY: What the fuck! [MUMBLING INAUDIBLY] Ken? [GROANS] It hurts so bad! - Oh, my God. - Fuck! Can't somebody do something? [GRUNTS] Hey, Ken? - Buddy? - ASHLEY: No! [SOBS] No! You're all right, buddy, huh? [CRIES] No! [GAME WHIRS] One down. [CACKLES] [ALL RETCHING] ASHLEY: Oh, no. Watch him. [GAME CONTINUES CLICKING] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [COUGHS] It's real. What's real? The game. MARY-ANN: It's not possible. Look, we started at 24. Matt died, that took us to 23. Then Kenny, 22. - It's real. - ASHLEY: No! No, no, no, no. It can't... It can't be. [SOBS] Why is this happening? Because we agreed to play the fucking game. MARY-ANN: That's... That's not possible. I fucking knew it, man. I just fucking knew it. I told you, motherfucker. You and your fucking stupid game. Look what happened to my boy. [GAME THUDS] [TYLER GRUNTS] MARY-ANN: Tom, what are you doing? You heard the rules. We kill someone or we die. Put the phone down. "Make a choice. "You or I. "Without decision, one will die." MAN: You don't want to do this. TOM: We don't wanna die. MARY-ANN: Tom, put the gun down. Beth! Do something! We'll figure it out when the cops get here. And say what? That a game did this? Someone has to die soon. And it's not me and it's not Beth. Are you fucking crazy? - And then what? - Hey, man, just don't, huh? This isn't you. You can't play God. I'm not playing God. I'm playing the game of death. [GAME WHIRS] One down. [CACKLES] TYLER: Oh, fuck! [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV] We need to go. We need to go. Now! No, no, no, no, no! No! No! [MAN ON TV] She only interrupts her meal for short moments to breathe. Every five or eight minutes, she replenishes her air supply. The calf has drunk the milk supply dry. Only when the mother has produced new milk will it return. The largest loss of manatees took place in 1996... when over 150 of them suddenly died. [SIREN WAILING] [GAME CONTINUES CLICKING] MARY-ANN: We have to go back and tell the cops the truth. We can't just leave them there. It's wrong. It's gonna be okay. What the fuck out of all this seems okay to you, man? All we have to do is kill 21 people. ASHLEY: Seriously, Tom, shut the fuck up. We can't just go around killing innocent people. Even fucking Tyler is making more sense than you right now. MARY-ANN: Can you stop the car? [SOBS] Can you stop the car and let me out now please? - Just stop the car. - BETH: Calm down, Mary-Ann. Mary-Ann. Guys, is there another choice? Jeez, I don't know, Beth. How about this? Let's not kill 21 innocent lives today, huh? What do you think? You heard the rules. It's kill or be killed. ASHLEY: Tom. Stop acting like we're in a fucking videogame. MARY-ANN: I can't kill anyone. BETH: If we don't murder someone, it's suicide. - MARY-ANN: I would rather die. - BETH: Not me. Fuck! Fuck, man! Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. [SOBBING] [TIRES SCREECH] What the fuck! Watch where you're going, asshole. I'm sorry, man. My bad. - Hit him. - What? You're fucking out of your mind. Fucking hit him. I'm not going to hit nobody, all right? This ain't fucking Carmageddon? - [MAN SCREAMS] - [TIRES SCREECH] Tyler... Do you wanna die? What the fuck are you doing, man? Do it. [ASHLEY AND MARY-ANN SOBBING] Now! [CAR SCREECHES] [MARY-ANN EXCLAIMS] Now back up. Back up the fucking car, Tyler. - [GEAR LEVER SHIFTS] - Fucking psycho.

WOMAN: No, no, no, no. - Please. - Don't you want us to live? - [WOMAN SOBS] - Yes. WOMAN: No, no, no, no. Please. Please don't. Please don't kill me. I won't tell anyone. Now listen, Beth. - I won't tell anyone. - Just pull the trigger. [WOMAN PANTS] I can't, Tom. Yes, you can. I'm sorry. No, please don't. Please don't. Please. I won't tell anyone. I won't tell anyone. [SOBBING] [WOMAN GRUNTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GAME WHIRS] One down. [CACKLES] [MARY-ANN SOBBING] ASHLEY: Say hi to the losers back home. Who is full of his spit? You? This flower is full of Kenny's spit. - ALISON: Ooh. - He's coming down... - ALISON: Let's clap. - KENNY: What's up? - How are you guys? - ASHLEY: Good. - How are you? - Not too bad. [SIGHS] MARY-ANN: What... Oh. Can I have this? ASHLEY: Nice dick. Somebody put a dick on my face? [MARY-ANN LAUGHS] [MAN ON TV] Manatees take every aspect of life... at a slow pace. Perhaps this is the reason why they only reproduce every two to five years. In West African folklore... [MARILYN GRUNTS] Mmm. Mm-mm. This is so good. What? Oh, Winston. You need to eat your vegetables. Vroom. [IMITATES SWOOSHING] Yes, this is a fudge plane asking for a landing. Sorry, I can't hear you. [GASPS] Houston, we have a problem. Hey, Winston. You know the rules. No veggies, no dessert. I'll be back soon, pumpkin. I'll let you listen in, okay? [RADIO BEEPS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV] Testing, one, two, three, testing. - [DOOR SHUTS] - [WINSTON BARKS] [MAN ON TV] Humans have played a large part in reducing their numbers, due to the destruction of their ecosystem, and collisions with boats.

We need to focus. [BREATHING HEAVILY] If we go off the rails, we lose. You don't think we've already gone off the fucking rails, do you? Huh? - [WHIMPERS] - You went off the fucking rails half an hour ago. Go ahead. Shoot me, motherfucker. Shoot me. I'm getting tired of your bullshit. I never wanted to play this game to begin with. This is your game. Are you fucking stupid? I just saved your life. - What's wrong with you? - Saved our lives? So we can rot in prison? I'd say that's a better option than your head exploding. Beth. We can find another way. You don't have to keep doing this. Yes, we do. No! No, you don't. You... 24 people? [CAR HONKS] Tom? Tom? Don't fucking do anything, okay? [RADIO BEEPS] Oh, Oh. Oh, Winston. I'm gonna have to hang up. Oh, my God. Oh. My, my. What happened? Are you folks injured? Are you okay? No... Uh... yeah. We hit a deer. Um, but I think we're all actually pretty lucky, uh, none of us got hurt. [SIGHS] Are you sure? Because from the way you look... I think you guys should be on the floor. Where's the deer? We tossed it into the woods. Poor thing. I mean, you should have been more careful. So where is it? Oh, it's just... somewhere down there. We sort of just pushed it into the bushes. MARILYN: Oh, yeah. You were down there. You should get yourselves checked out. It's tick heaven. You look on your skin for a bull's-eye. - It looks something like... - Uh, we're fine. But, uh, thank you. We... We actually really have to go, so... Oh, this must be your chariot, eh, dear? Yeah, that's my car. Uh... I deliver for them.

We're his friends. I'm sorry, but we really have to go. - Thank you though. - All right then. I should probably hit the road, too. Winston gets depressed when I leave him alone. Oh. He got bitten by a snake last week. Poor baby. I had to suck out the venom, and then I had to drive 200 miles straight to the hospital. And they told me that snakes around here don't have any venom. Can't get any closer to a dog than that. Ah, here I go again. I swear most of my friends say Winston is all I talk about. [CHUCKLES] Well... You have yourselves a good day. Bye now. [RADIO BEEPS] Winston, Mama loves you very much. [SIGHS] Hey, wait! [CHUCKLES] I completely forgot to offer you some fudge. My sister made it for me.

[CACKLES] - I told you we can't stop. - Hey, put that down. - ASHLEY: No! - [GUNSHOT] [GASPS] TOM: Drop the gun or I'll shoot. - [EXCLAIMS] - Tom, let her go, right now. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Beth, in the car. Let her fucking go right now, man. I'm sorry, Ash. I only ever wanted to save you. [EXCLAIMS] Oh, fudge. You should have shot him! All over a fucking rampage. This is a 10-31, 10-32, 10-33 and a 10-35. Come help us. Okay. Now... Tell me what is going on. Fuck. My name is Ashley, and I'm an alcoholic. She has a problem. - [CAN POPS] - Do it. BETH: Wow! That was nothing. It's "be there, be square, 'cause otherwise you're not a-round." Get it? [CHUCKLES] ASHLEY: Your jokes are always on point. BETH: I don't even remember what she looks like anymore. You see someone every day and... Maybe she was right. If you wanna give up, then kill me. Are you crazy? I can't live if you die anyway. I'm not killing you, you dumb fuck. I guess I'll just have to do it myself. Don't you fucking do it. I can't see you die. Drop the fucking gun. - [GROANS] Ashley... - MARILYN: Is it allergies? Oh, my God. This isn't looking good. He needs a medic. Yes, I need a medic here on Parish Road. - Right away. - [GROANING] Someone is having a stroke or something worse. I called for an ambulance decades ago. And it's still not here.

[WHIMPERS] We have to stop them. We have to end this. We all have to die. [CAR STARTS] Maybe they killed the Ranger. I doubt it. I would have killed her for you. I know. Would you have killed yourself for me? Hey, hey, Ted? Hey, man, listen. Hey, my bad I didn't make it back to you. I know, man. I know. Yeah, I'm with some fucking girl, man. [SIGHS] Where are they? Hey, I gotta ask you something, okay? Could you find a way to track my car with your GPS? My own little game of death. It's just asthma. Don't be such a queen. Tyler, I need you to promise me that you won't let me down. Do you fucking understand what you're asking me to do? I don't wanna die either. But now we have to play. I should just kill you now and put you out of your misery. Go for it. Everybody suffers. We have to end this game. And when we actually find them, what are we supposed to do? Convince Tom and Beth to sit around with us until our heads blow up? Some people wanna end their pain. We're gonna go help people, Beth. Uh, Ted? You got something for me or what? Wait a minute. Slow down. What... Wait, it's where? [ELEVATOR DINGS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] WOMAN 1: Pathology. [WOMAN 2 SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] - WOMAN 1: We'll be right there. - WOMAN 2: Thank you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [TROLLEY CLATTERING] Wake up, Sam. Time for your medication. I hate these. You just hang in there. A few more weeks to go. Mom's been saying that for months. Just a little longer. Am I gonna die here? Not on my watch. You go back to sleep. [SONG PLAYING IN FRENCH] We can do this, Beth. It's a game. Let's end it. Final stage.

Hurry up. [BREATHING HEAVILY] What's your name? Beth. You wanna know my name? No. Are you here to visit someone? No. Why do you have a gun? BETH: I'm... Close your eyes. And count to ten. One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine... Beth... Put down the gun. What are you doing here? Drop... the gun. It doesn't matter. They're all gonna die anyway. We're helping them. You're fucking insane. Look at her. She's just a little girl. ASHLEY: Spare her, Beth. If you wanna kill somebody... just kill me. If that's what you want. ASHLEY: What did I do? I smoked. [CHUCKLES] [WOMEN EXCLAIM] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] - What's your name? - Samantha. It's all gonna be okay, Samantha. TYLER: Get in there. Hurry. [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO] No! No! [SOBBING] Beth. I'm sorry. [SOBBING] I'm so sorry. [KISSES] [SCREAMING] [DOOR OPENS] - You did this? - You can't kill innocent people. We are innocent. [GROANS] [INHALES] It was almost over. It is over, Tom. Game over. [BOTH GRUNTING] Fuck! [TOM GASPING] [COUGHING] [GASPING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GAME WHIRS] One down. [CACKLES] [GAME CONTINUES CLICKING] One left. We think we're so significant. That our lives... matter. We mean nothing. Think about it. Really try to understand. Why are you here? [SCOFFS] You can't answer. Everyone we love is dead. I didn't make up the rules, you didn't make up the rules, nobody has any fucking idea what the rules are. But I get it now. Whatever you do, however you try to help people, however you think you can make this world a better place, the only real way to win... is to die. Everyone thinks the goal is to escape death. But death... death is the bonus level. Until then, it's a matter of choice. You reptilian bitch. [GUNSHOT] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GAME WHIRS] One down. [CACKLES] You win. [CACKLES] [SIGHS] Merry Christmas, Officer Smith. Oh, yeah. Evidence number 342. Yeah, tackle box from the riverside murder scene. Huh... I remember that night. I'm surprised there's anything still in there. Grampton? You're next. This should be a good one. Game of death. You're sure your wife didn't slip that in? [CHUCKLES] I remember this. Burns, you were there. Anybody wanna play?
