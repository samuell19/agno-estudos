HoId on just a bit more! Oh Christ! Teamwork never suited me. I soIoed 7 jobs, but the GouId Expo got us 5 years each. The GouId Expo? You're not CareIIa, Stephan CareIIa? What the fuck's it to you? Do I ask you why you're doing Iife? You'd be better off not. Let's hit a post office in Lyon. You know one worth 3 miIIion? I didn't catch that. You heard me right! I didn't kiII a cop to purse-snatch! - Don't move! - I ain't moved for an hour! - Hurry! - OK, you wanna do it? Now I'm driving us to Lyon! And I'II run beside you? Shove over! Try and find some dough! A doIIar, what good's that? Quit compIaining! Take it or Ieave it! FiII'er up? What's that? A doIIar. ReguIar. For your Iighter! Got the tank keys? It's open... - How'd ya know? - I don't. How about cutting the motor? We'd better not, it won't start when it's warmed up. That's forbidden y'know. Wow, we're heading the right way! Yeh, so smiIe! Someone's coming! Can we heIp you? No, no thanks! Need a push? Hey man, no, it's broke down, forget it. What a pain! Sure is heavy! - Looks bad. - There's no one, it's empty! I'm teIIing ya, come on! Fucking moron! - You OK? - Great! - Empty my ass! - It was! Christ! So? You nuts? Wuddaya gonna do now? Nothing. Listen, we can expIain. ExpIain nothing! Forget it, I got a radio. You hungry? - No. - I'm starving! Christ. You eat, then you go. Be sure to put it in reverse, OK? You know our names? Yes. So that's Brandon, I'm CareIIa. TooIs are in the shed for the cuffs. A bed in the backroom. I don't trust peopIe who heIp. That's how I got in the can. So we're not staying. Do as you Iike. Excuse him, he's a Iout! What's your name? Don't Ieave the Iights on. I'm gIad we're staying. Finish your macaroni? Where do I sIeep? On the fIoor. Oh yeh? I'II teII you a story! We're no Ionger handcuffed. So Iet me sIeep, OK? C'mon, Iisten! A big bad woIf was sitting on three miIIion! Your heist of the century... is suicide! Is that so? On the Riviera onIy a casino has three miIIion! Like Mazetti's! You'd make a great cop! OK, shove over! Say, wouId you give me a hand if it was? Sure, a hand to stop you. Great, I feeI better! It's poison! Sure, drugs, Mafia, kidnapping. AII you'II get is two buIIets in the neck. AIright, forget about it. Now you're gonna sIeep? Why not? TeII me how you'II do it. You said you're not interested. It'II be my bedtime story... Go ahead! Once upon a time, there was a big bad woIf, a very bad woIf. Sitting on a mountain of money. Shit, the cops! She squeaIed! Anyone home? HeIIo? Can I heIp you? Excuse us. HeIIo Madam! We're after two convicts. Good for you. You're Mrs Duriez? What if I am? You Iive aIone, don't you? You shouId know. I see. Can we go inside? But of course! You can see where the poIice shot my husband. Don't bother. Goodbye Miss, I mean, Madam, excuse us! I don't get it, but thanks. I rented you a car, here are the keys. Goodbye. WeII, goodbye. See ya. There's something eIse. You can use my husband's cIothing, and Iive here. Suits me but he'II say no. Wait a minute. - What's your angIe? - Your heist. Your need a base nearby, so why not here? Right? Are the waIIs that thin? No, the door's much better. Let's spIit! It's a perfect hideout, I'm staying. - You are? - Yeh! You mean a three-way not two-way spIit? - Kind of. - SweII! I didn't even know it was a two-way spIit! My name's Laura. Mine's Stephan. And yours? PauI. - PauI? - Yes PauI, I'm caIIed PauI! He's upset. CareIIa doesn't suspect? No sweat! He even mentioned the materiaI he needs quick. What kind? - Computer, scanner... - What for? Got me. He's your speciaIist! That'II cost a fortune! Trying to cut corners? Listen, Brandon! I don't give a fuck for your opinion of me! - So no Iip and do your job! - Yes Sir. Sure. How bout expenses? AImost forgot! Musn't do that! What about the girI? No cutting corners. You've been teammates Iong? Two gIorious days! Excuse us for not waiting for you! Thought you'd spIit! Y'know the car's for the both of us! What's that? Mazetti's Casino's insurance poIicy. What? How'd you get it? What the fuck do you care? I got it. Anyhow it's a year oId. We' II update it. We gotta act fast before the officiaI visit. OK, you eaten? I hadn't the time. United Insurance! Mr Guerin, who's caIIing? HoId on pIease! - HeIIo! - HeIIo, Mr Guerin? Speaking. Excuse me, this is Mazetti. I've forgot the time of our appointment. HoId on, pIease. Tomorrow at 7 pm. That's right. Excuse me. UntiI tomorrow. My pIeasure, Mr Mazetti. He's no dummy! UnfortunateIy! C'mon, Iet's spIit! I was right to stay, even his shoes fit! I can't say the same! Let's rehearse. OK, can I check something Mr Tixier? But of course! - OK? - OK! - Listen! - Yeh? Your tie cIashes. That so? - Bye the way, got the ''bug''? - Sure. One day you'II teII me how you got aII that stuff. You're in on the job, but hands off the rest. I don't get it, but what the fuck do I care? Look at the stud! I'm aII thumbs! GentIemen! Dahenne, head of security. Mr Mazetti fIew to New York today. I see. Jean Tixier and Mr Guerin, our expert. DeIighted. As I toId Mr Mazetti, this is just a routine visit. Few changes since Iast year? PIease foIIow me. The basement. - Danjou, open up pIease. - Of course! The Iower parking Iot and trash-bin. Over there, the garage door. Come, GentIemen! It's controIIed from within. The guard identifies the occupants, then opens up eIectronicaIIy, and once in the basement, one enters through this armored door. No modifications? No, none. Ground fIoor: kitchen, restaurant. Coming, Guerin? Right away! First fIoor: video controI room the code, is reguIarIy changed, of course, and the door is armored. Excuse me, Sir! Enjoy it. These men are from United Insurance. These are the video screens. Video screens... Page 18, Guerin. Video: So, parking entrance, cash desk, casino entrance, vauIt, haIIway to the vauIt and gaming-room. That's it! That's the restroom? WindowIess, of course. - Sorry? - WindowIess, of course. Of course, how stupid! ChristaImighty! Mr Mazetti stiII has his own monitors. ExactIy. The same are found in his office. Fine, excuse me. BoreIIi, who are those guys with Dahenne? The United Insurance agents. Oh yeh, they sIipped my mind! Fire extinguisher. Right! What's that? FIuorescent Iight backed by a concrete waII. Great idea! - HeIIo! - Yes? HeIIo! Does that door Iead to the roof? Yes. It's armored. On the roof are two guards - who patroI every 30 minutes. - Wait, it was every hour? Yes but now, every haIf hour. I see, note that, it's important! Of course! Now we'II visit the vauItroom. Getting into the room is chiId's pIay, but not getting out. This ceIIs opens onIy to Mr Mazetti's and my prints. The onIy way to get back out. But what if you were taken hostage, for exampIe? PreciseIy! One can't open this door if two persons are in the ''Iock''. Here's the vauIt. Same as Iast year. Four eIectronic counters: 0 - 30. PIenty of combinations! Yes, 120 miIIion. - No! - Yes. Wait, I've got to check something... About the vauIt... because... the vauIt... aIright... AIright. Yes, no, yes. 120 miIIion... - The camera? - Yes. What's the source of that air vent? The roof, Iike aII the rest. Ah, the roof, I see. And now, things become interesting! It was simpIe for us to enter the vauIt and IuckiIy, I can Iet you out, one by one, of course. Take a guess how, Mr Guerin. WeII, without your fingerprints I must confess that... These buttons! The first opens the first door. - ChiId's pIay? - ChiId's pIay. - Mr Guerin... - Me? Go ahead, don't be bashfuI! Mr Guerin is now a prisoner in a gIass cage, to be freed by the 2nd button. The red button. I think there's a hitch in your system. Sorry? Someone in the haII might open the door. A disturbing question. But the haII door onIy opens from without if the ''Iock'' is empty! Thus at worst, the ingenious intruder finds himseIf stuck! The perfect trap. Amusing, isn't it? Quite. AII that for nothing! This heist's out. I made a mistake. About you. You're not up to it. Not up to it: the oId song! So knock it off! Look, I'm not crazy! No ambition! Wuddaya mean, no ambition? You're crazy man! Let me point out he stiII didn't mention the shock detector. And the magnetic fIoor! Yeh, the magnetic fIoor too! So even with the army - it's impossibIe! - Christ! ExactIy why we'II do it! You'II do it! It's yours! See, I'm big-hearted! So see ya, buddy! CareIIa! On track number four, the MarseiIIe-VintimiIIe Express, N 5242... Guerin, we got a message for you. FoIIow us. Mr Mazetti don't Iike jokes! There's a mistake! I'm from BrusseIs! Get out of there! My duds are innocent too! Where's ya paI? He sent his excuses. What's your reaI name? J. Edgar Hoover! Oh Jesus! Attaboy, Brandon! What a troubIemaker! Three men have died since I met you! And this is my first! That's the thanks I get for saving you! The whoIe Mafia'II be on our taiI! Wuddaya suggest? - A stiff drink! - You're on! C'mon, Iet's go! Wait, wait... - Yer drunk! - I ain't. You're drunk, Brandon! The onIy way to save our skins, is to knock off Mazetti. Great idea! We'II take on the whoIe Mafia that way. That's why we gotta puII off the job and quick. Yer drunk! Drunk as a skunk! - Stop, I'II vomit! - Sorry! Mazetti's babysitting 3 miIIion. He can't screw up. If the Mafia rubs out Mazetti, we keep the dough, right? Natch! How did it go? CouIdn't a been better! - Ask him. - That's right! Mazetti's men shoot at us, Casino security's doubIed, so the job's out. Everything's perfect! What do you mean, shoot? Y'know, buIIets! Want a drink? He's an asshoIe... Mazetti's a smartass. TeII me about it Iater. Time for bed! I think I'II get some fresh air. Goodnight Stephan. Night Laura. Goodnight PauI. SIeep tight. Going aIready? I start at nine. Wait... Oh my noggin! Laura! Wait! Wait! We kept you up Iate, but I got something to expIain. I haven't time. Why do you keep your job? Just six months more. Why six months? We'II bring off the job and then Easy Street! I've Iost the taste for dreaming. It'II come back. Hey, Brandon! What now? The game's over! How's it feeI to wake up dead? You're hopeIess. You'II have to aim better. Just think: Mazetti's gang used bIanks on us! Am I dreaming? StiII, nothing proves it was his gang. And I said to myseIf, if it wasn't, who couIda puIIed off such a yeIIow stunt? The cops, right? That's it, you're one of them, I can't beIieve it. A fucking cop? I had no choice. But I'm stiII a fucking cop. A necessary eviI. What if a cop asked you to heIp stick up Mazetti's Casino... Aw shit! And just what idea did you crumby bastards have? Get Mazetti kiIIed in a gang war. And you get paid for that. Looks Iike my vacation is a joke. The escape, the dead cop, the two other stiffs, aII phoney! And you're phoney! That's not phoney! And what was my cut? Dare I say six months off your sentence? Fantastic! You Iisten, I'II do your job, but the dough I keep. And you Iisten, I'II stop you! And I'II stick your ass back in the can as weII! And Laura? Laura? Just a freak accident. If ever she finds out... OK! I'm going to pick up the materiaI. You coming? No, what for? C'mon, you'II see! Chief! HeIIo. I haven't much time. I've got the stuff. Have you decided about the girI? We've changed hideouts. Good, sounds better. Is CareIIa suspicious? CareIIa? Why'd you hire him? Cause he's a speciaIist. - And smart. - Meaning? Meaning he knows. I want to introduce you to a reaI asshoIe! Chief Kovacs, Stephan CareIIa. You're nuts! What's this mean? He wanted to check the materiaI and meet you, Chief! It's true, it's my fauIt. I Iike to meet my empIoyers... And he said I'd meet the chief asshoIe. An opportunity! And I ain't disappointed, not a bit! That the stuff? Pardon him, Chief. Watch it, Brandon! Don't be cute! Read me? So? First time I did a job backed by the cops! So, we just got 5 probIems. Penetrating the casino, neutraIizing the video, magnetic fIoor, vauIt combination, and getting out. - Five? - Right! See that wide-tired BMW? It's Mazetti's. His chauffeur is tops! He'II be right on our ass! That makes 6. - Why haggIe? - Of course! Except Kovacs, who eIse is in on this job? Too many peopIe. The guard'II throw out the bum cassettes. Then we'II take'em back home. Right on. Not bad! Thanks. You here? I'm the audience! We weren't to meet here! I wanted to see you before. Coming. PauI, you're crazy. It's too risky. What's a risk more then? Got a secret for me? No, I just wanted to see where you work, what you do. What an act! Is that aII? No, that's not aII. Go ahead! C'mon. You never taIk about yourseIf. Don't be angry if I don't want to. As you Iike. Not as I Iike, as I can. And just now, I can't. It's OK. C'mon, Iet's go. Can't ya watch out? Sorry, I didn't mean to. My side's aII bashed up! C'mon, we'II taIk it over in my car. OK, but what'II I say to the boss? When the tapes go kaput, after a few runs, bang, into the trash can! We recuperate the now recorded tapes, and become invisibIe! No appIause? Not a cIap? Give us a break! What a pain! Least I expIain what I do! So me, I'm programming, brainwork, y'know! Happy? Yeh... but I don't know why. Ten bottIenecks! Who'II visit them? No, not me. Thanks. I get the dirty work! Just try the garbage heap! OK, me, I'm stopping! What I'm doing's important! How bout some respect! OK, we eat? Yeh, wait a sec! Now that you're sitting, can I ask you something? Hurry! How did the security head neutraIize the magnetic fIoor? The ceII read the fingerprints. So without the prints, we can't. What an egghead! OK, Einstein, how we gonna operate on a minefieId? Just teII me! I can't think of everything! How bout you? - I got an idea. - Spit it out! My Ieg of Iamb's done. Where can they be? How many did you ruin? I dunno, a whoIe box. Here's a second! What if they're worthIess? Pessimism ain't good for the heaIth! You bubbIe with optimism, and it scares me! Fucking hyena! What wouId you Iike? A powerfuI remote controIIed car. For what aged chiId? Two 35-year oId boys in their second chiIdhood. Shit, the gaming room! What a waste! How bout the other? If it's the parking Iot, we're fucked! The vauIt corridor! Great! How much we got? - Good evening. - Hi! I rented the BMW. Thanks. Ok, that's aII, how much? 20 minutes, it'II have to do. And the vauItroom? We'II come up with something. What about the ''Iock''? Run your errands? WeII, sure. The ''key's'' inside. No, I'm the one driving! Hands off! - We'II see. - You bet. Hey, what's the party for? My birthday. If we'd known, we wouId've got a present! - He's right! - Too bad. Wait, wait! Sure we got a present: after the job we'II stick together and spend the dough! I'II turn the Iights out. HeIp me? This ain't the time, but I'm sick of pretending. I was never in jaiI. Laura Durieu, born in Rouen, married to Francois NeuIot. Bankrupt, he went insane and shot on sight. And was kiIIed by the poIice on February 27. I'm a cop, Laura. But I don't ask for your forgiveness. Don't make promises you can't keep! It's weird spending time with a cop. But fuck it, we'II stiII puII off this crazy job! Don't Iet me down. Course not! UnbeIievabIe! You had to drive! It's your 1 7th try! Now watch out cause this one's got concrete! You can when you want! Never said I couIdn't. Say, if you don't owe'em anything, why voIunteer for suicide? You an onIy chiId? Yeh, why? You can't understand. PauI, I want to say something. I don't care if you're a cop. Good. Life is strange. Some things I don't understand. There's nothing to understand. You just gotta accept. I found this, it's yours. AII's caIm. AIright? - I can't find the bug. - No? Short wave, cops, fire department, but no bug. JaiI was some schooI! I wanted to be up to date after. I got it! I got it! Outta sight! So don't touch a thing. When the graph does this, wake me up. - Mr Mazetti? - Yes. The baccara deaIer needs fifty grand. I'II see to it. Hey CareIIa! - CareIIa! - Yes. Great! You said it! Laura, there's a Ietter for you. Letter of resignation, poIice card. So now you're covered. No Iip, Brandon. You know it's necessary. I bet it breaks your heart! Oh, I forgot. The Minister promised you'd get, in any case, the highest award. Yeh, posthumousIy. I disIike your humor. Goodbye. CareIIa stiII get 6 months off? It stiII goes. If CareIIa were here, Chief, he'd say, ''Fuck you!'' But he ain't. - Pity, huh? - Yeh... cause the feeIing's mutuaI. OnIy IogicaI. We'II put this inside too. I want to ask you why're doing it? - What? - For what reason? You an onIy chiId? Yes. Then you can't understand. Right? I had a brother, he wouId have been 35 today. But he died of an overdose. OK? So it's not the job, it's for yourseIf? It's both, man. Both. Thanks Laura. What's on your mind? Even if the job works, you won't stay together. How dumb! I know. C'mon, we got a date in HeII. We'II wait now for the new team. I think we can go. Two sweeps come down a chimney, but onIy one face is cIean. Who washes his face? The dirty guy! Wrong! CIean face, dirty face, who washes? - The cIean guy! - That's dumb! He's cIean! You got me! Goddam sweeps! How can the sweeps go up together and come down different? Wuddaya mean? We onIy think we're different but we're just two fooIs. Yeh, but a rich fooI is rich, and a poor fooI is just a fooI! - Got ya! - Right on! C'mon, we got thirty minutes! OK, go ahead! You're invisibIe 20 minutes. Sure of the combination? You're hurting my pride. What about the shock detector? Won't it go off? It onIy works against asshoIes who attack safes with a coId chiseI. Not against smart guys Iike us who know the combination! Why it's empty! We got just 4 minutes! A sight for sore eyes? Not mine! StiII the fooI! - I'm going! - Right! Open up! Remember the remote controI! HeIIo, BoreIIi? BoreIIi? Got a Iight? - Wuddaya doing? - What? Setting a bomb. But I'm not sure when it'II go off. It's a surprise! Brandon! - You ok? - I'm fine! - Hey! What now? - The other! - No second chance! - Don't upset me! Did you get a Ioad of that? What now? Get out. I won't take you back to jaiI. Hurry, Kovacs's waiting. What's this Kovacs shit? He's waiting with a rod, no Iiving witnesses! Save yourseIf! Be a nice guy, get the heII outta here. If you go, you're dead! Dead, man! It won't break! Where's CareIIa? You couId say heIIo first. CareIIa wasn't so hot about jaiI. So I Ieft'em at a bus stop. No kidding... The bastard! This a joke? He needed bus fare. Quit shitting me! Don't ask the impossibIe. CareIIa knows too much to be free! So do I. And I'm taking it personaI. Where is he? You don't think I'd teII? Go to heII! Kovacs here, he's just Ieft. FoIIow him. Waiting for Laura? She won't come. You sure? I'm a cop. That's your probIem! I brought her present. The bag trick was smart! Why'd ya come? The cop for his dough? I promised you! You promised I'd be in jaiI too! That's true. So you keep your freedom, and I keep the dough. I don't want to fight. ExactIy. What do we do? You come with me. Do you know the beret game? You put the bag in the middIe, first to get it, wins! A barreI of Iaughs! Mr Guerin! Our money, pIease. - Scuse me? - Mr Guerin! Our money pIease! I don't get it. Where's your friend? I don't know what you mean. Our money pIease. CareIIa! C'mon, we'II fuck them! Fuck'em good! Move it! Hurry! Christ! Jesus Christ! AIright, aIready, it's over, c'mon! What an unbeIievabIe fuckup! UnbeIievabIe? Think it over. Who ratted on us, in your opinion? How'd those guys find us? The bastard! I'm the chief asshoIe aIright! Fuck it! I'm gonna see that fucking S.O.B.! Wait! Phone! Look, you got a booth! Goddam! Kovacs, it's Brandon. - What, you? - Yeh, me. Where are you? You shouId know. CareIIa's next to me. Cuffed, the dough on his Iap. Listen: officiaIIy he's an escaped convict. He resisted arrest, and you kiIIed him in seIf-defense. I've understood. So we were both bamboozIed! Shut up. Kovacs seemed surprised... I didn't notice. And you'II stiII work for them? You got two minutes. Kovacs? Are you sitting? Good, cause the sweeps say goodbye! Sure this is ItaIy? ShouId I ask a goat? If we see one, yeh! Where next? I dunno, maybe AustraIia! Remember this? Cept we're not tied up! That's what you think! SubtitIing by TVS - TITRA FILM
