[WHOOSHING] NARRATOR: Out of the incredible far reaches of outer space, a weird flying saucer enters the solar system. Its destination, a planet with a single moon, the green planet, earth. Soon the fantastic vessel is within the outer levels of earth's atmosphere, continuing its inexorable course toward the planet. Radar screens on the earth pick up the saucer as an unidentified object. UFO is approaching our sector. Jet squadrons investigate. Jet squadrons investigate. [WHOOSHING] Intruder, attention! We demand that you reveal your identity! What is your purpose in flying over this sector? Acknowledge! Acknowledge! All planes, ready to attack! Acknowledge! Acknowledge! [GUILLOTINE LAUGHING] I identified myself! I am Emperor Guillotine from the planet Carpotha and my purpose? I have come to conquer the earth! Now feel the power of the Emperor! We are under attack! [WHOOSHING] NARRATOR: The flying saucer dove into the sea, disappearing far into the depths of the Pacific Ocean. For many months, it did not reappear. And authorities began to believe it was destroyed. Then strange things began to happen in the Pacific. It seems so quiet. But the quiet sea is dangerous these days. Dangerous? And why is it dangerous, mister? Do you really want to know? You want me to tell you? Right in this area, ships have disappeared without a single clue as to how. They must have been attacked and sunk somehow. You know, it won't do any good to let it scare you. I'm glad that you take that attitude. There's much less passengers aboard the ship than usual. You have a lot of courage for a boy your size. But I'd rather be tall, like you! You will! We're right in the most dangerous area now. Listen. We'd better stay alert! Sure! You made this trip, mister? Knowing the danger? Mmm. You see, I'm Jerry Mano and in the Unicorn... That is... I mean, I'm a writer. -Now you tell me your name. -Me? I'm Johnny Sokko! Nice to meet you! My pleasure, Johnny. [BEEPING] Sorry, Johnny. This is Unicorn Agent U3. Will you acknowledge? Chief, we've contacted U3. Good. This is Azuma. U3, any action? JERRY: Well, the water is sort of rippling and, uh, there's a couple of fish I can see playing. Cut that out. This is no joke. I'm sorry, sir. Who is he talking to? It's strange. I'll call you just as soon as anything happens. You better call! What a grouch. [RUMBLING] [BOTH GRUNTING] Look there! Look at that! [GROWLING] -Oh, help! -Look at that! Oh, help! Help me! Johnny, that must be the monster that's been causing all the sinking! It's awful. Mr. Mano, we better get into the water and quick! Let's go! Oh! Oh! Oh! -About ready to go? -Yes! Hang on to me, Johnny! -Johnny! -Mr. Mano! [BOTH GRUNTING] [COUGHING] Mr. Mano? Mr. Mano? Oh, oh. Well, Johnny, we survived the ship wreck. But where, where are we? I'm not sure. That monster. What was that thing anyway? Dracolon. I've got to check in. Unicorn, Agent U3 reporting to headquarters! U3 reporting! Come in! Acknowledge! Acknowledge! No good! My transmitter's dead. Let's look around, Johnny. MAN: Hold it! [LAUGHING] You're too slow, friend. I'll blast the boy if you try it. [LAUGHING] You had better cooperate. We know you're a Unicorn agent. No, you wrong! MAN: You liar! U3, you are going to tell us just what you know about us! I don't know a thing! All right then. We'll do it the hard way! -Take the brat! -Right. Let go! Stop! [GRUNTING] -You, Johnny! -Coming! MAN: Get them! Fire! No! Don't shoot! You'll hit me! Fire, fire! [GROANING] [YELLING] -It's a dead end! -We're trapped! Blast 'em! [WHIRRING] What is that? Tremendous! A giant robot! Jump down. What a fantastic robot. He must be about 100 feet tall! He sure is a giant! Quick! Follow me! Oh! Quickly, this way. Hurry! Say. Who are you? My name is Dr. Lucius Guardian. The Gargoyle Gang's beenforcing me to build that robot so they can use it to conquer the world! Building it? You took a pretty big chance, helping us. But now you must try to get away! It'll soon be completed! It'll be the most powerful thing on earth! When the Gargoyles have that robot, nobody'll be able to stop them, because no power can stop the robot. You mean it isn't ready yet? No. Giant Robot is ready. All he needs is atomic power to activate his brain. Then his controls will be operating and with this, this miniature transmitter, he will be under the control of the first voice that is recorded in his electronic brain. Really? With this microphone? Hey, Giant Robot, start to move! Johnny, no! Well. The Gargoyle Gang is going to lose. I've planted an atomic bomb that will explode in 5 minutes. They're coming this way! -You? Did you see them? -No! You? Any sign of them? Hey! JERRY: What're you doing? Go on, run! I'll hold them off! It's the spies! Get 'em! [YELLING] Look! It blew up the whole hill! He sure meant what he said! Gee. The giant robot is gone. Look! The giant robot is good as new! Now, Giant Robot, into motion! He's moving! And at your command, too! You know what? It was the explosion! It must've been the radiation. It was just strong enough to activate his brain. Uh-huh. He would obey the first voice he heard, Dr. Guardian told us. It's you! Remember? What? What did you say? Oh! This is the control! Johnny, listen! What a break! Remember? You spoke into the mike? Now he will obey you! Tell me what to do! Might as well try to get a ride along with him. Then we call Chief Azuma and see what he says. Johnny, go on. Try. Giant Robot, please take us home to Tokyo now! Let's go. Take off, Giant Robot! They have stolen the flying robot! Very well. I shall teach them a lesson! Mighty One! Gargoyle Gang, Spider reporting. Spider, you will order the Dracolon to attack them immediately! We obey your command, sir. Now then, our conquest is under way. The Dracolon goes into action. His target will be Tokyo! [GROWLING] Look! What is this! Run, run! This is Agent U3, in the air and going to Tokyo. I don't need your jokes right now! Right this minute, the Dracolon is attacking Tokyo! The Dracolon! Tokyo! That monster! Giant Robot, hurry! [GROWLING] -Look! -What is it? A robot? MAN: What is it? Okay, Johnny, let him go. Giant Robot, destroy Dracolon! That kid is controlling the giant robot. Let's go! I'll handle the Gargoyle Gang. Johnny, you just command the robot! Spider, give up! Stop him. Fire! Giant Robot, use the jets! The atomic punch now! Use your rocket missiles! It's dead! JERRY: Johnny Sokko! Johnny Sokko, thanks. Dracolon is wiped out. Say, Johnny, he's amazing, this giant robot! Mr. Mano, I'll bet the Gargoyle Gang will try again. The giant robot is airborne! I want that giant robot caught! -Its course! -Right. Can't do it! Amazing! It's moving so fast, it can't be tracked! Ah! [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] NARRATOR: One of the largest meteorites ever seen has indeed landed in the Hikoni Mountains. Resting at the edge of a hill, it could roll down at any time. The defense forces are dispatched to check it. Spider! Oh. Hail, Guillotine! Spider! Have you located the flying robot? Well, I, uh... The giant robot is right now in the hands of the enemy. The giant robot has been captured by the Unicorn Organization and it's controlled by a boy named Johnny. I cannot fulfill the total plan of earth conquest as long as the flying robot is in the hands of the enemy! You must succeed or suffer the consequences. Yes, sir! Can you suggest a method? You idiot! Why do you think I had the Nucleon monster sent to earth? Then you mean we will use the monster? Of course! Unleash the Nucleon! The robot will try to stop it and then you will capture the flying robot! Do you understand? I do, sir! By Gargoyle, I will promise you that robot is going to be ours! Good! NARRATOR: Meanwhile, back at the Unicorn Organization lab, Flying Robo is undergoing tests. SCIENTIST: We are ready now. AZUMA: Ah. All personnel, you can begin the heat resistance testing! The full voltage, power on! [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] Can he do it? Uh-huh. Astounding! That's enough. Power off! Well! The temperature was up to over 3,000 degrees! I'm astonished it didn't melt. Mmm. -This is great, isn't it? -Yeah. There is no weapon on earth, according to those tests, that can damage that robot! Station 1 here, on the hill. Nothing to report now. What'll they do with it, that crazy rock? Well, I hope we don't have to haul it down the road. That's a load! It's a meteorite. It's just a hunk of rock! Oh! What's that sound? Oh. Oh, I think that stone is causing it. He's right. I think that's what it is! Listen, call headquarters quick! Uh, come in! Come in, headquarters! Headquarters, this is Station 1 calling! -Headquarters, come in! -[GROANING] [YELLING] What is it? Run! -Answer! -What's wrong on the hill? Answer! -Listen. -What? There. Quick! Get back! That giant robot is under your control, Johnny. The Unicorn Organization works for world peace. Will you join us, Johnny Sokko? The world needs your help now, Johnny. The Gargoyle Gang wants to conquer the earth! They will strike again with strange and terrible weapons! That is true. And it is when they launch new attacks, only the giant robot will be able to stop them. I will join you. I want to help save the world! You're a great kid, Johnny. Thank you. Now. I'm proud to say this young man is now a Unicorn agent. To be known as U7. Aye! U7. Congratulations. Just one more thing. Do not tell anyone your status as an agent. Only we know who you are around here. Do not talk even to your parents. Aye! On my word! I will promise! Commander! Sir? Well, what is it? Well, that big meteorite that landed in the Hikoni Range, a great ball was in it, sir, and now it's rolling down the hill. Must've been a Gargoyle Gang trick then. U3? U7? I'm ordering you to the scene at once! -Go! -BOTH: Aye! Be careful. Johnny Sokko? Good luck. Carry on. Johnny, you ready? Uh-huh. Attack! Johnny, look! There it is! That's right, and rolling toward the town! The Nucleon is moving! Now let's see what the robot can do about the Nucleon. [ALL LAUGHING] [PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Help! Hurry! Hurry! I'm afraid the town is doomed. I better call the robot. Giant Robot! Come! The giant robot is in the open! Now we will steal it back! Ah! At last! Giant Robot, the ball. Giant Robot, destroy that thing! Punch hard! All your might! [GRUNTS] He did it! That's what I call a great robot, huh? Go and get me the robot! Giant Robot, use the hand missiles! Oh, behind! Look out! It's that rotten boy again. Now, Robot. Attack! We have to get that kid. When we grab the boy, the robot will just stand still. Right. Come on! Now look! Grab him! You fool! Johnny, run! Ow! I'm coming! You must control the robot. So run! Right! No, wait! [GRUNTING] Go catch that kid! Stop! -Let go! -Ah, we got him. No! Let go, you cowards! You must be a member of the Gargoyle Gang! You're right. And I'm the boss of all the Gargoyles. See, I'm Spider! I want you to sleep. There. Get them into the car. Right. Come on, come on! Oh, look there! The giant robot is completely helpless! [LAUGHING] Nucleon! Now you will bring that robot! Commander! Giant Robot is moving strangely. Hmm. U3 and U7 are in danger! To the rescue. ALL: Aye! Now, Chief, what shall we do with them? Giant Robot won't make a move without that kid. So the kid will go to the laboratory where he can be brainwashed by the Hypnoton. Ah, what about this tall one? Shall I blast him? No, we can shoot him later. I want all the Unicorn agents and he will tell me who they are. Hmm. I understand. Then we can get rid of everybody, right? With the giant robot obeying us and Unicorn broken up completely, then the world will be in our power for sure. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] At last, the giant flying robot is mine! [TIRES SCREECHING] They're blocking the road! Push it away! Right. [YELLS] Oh! It's Unicorn! [GROANS] Gargoyles, you better surrender! You're surrounded! I'm going to bring in the machine. Nucleon! Nucleon! Look! Nucleon, destroy the Unicorn squadron. [LAUGHS] How do you like that? That's great! Yeah, that is beautiful! We don't have a chance here! Oh! That shooting! Jerry! Wake up! Wake up! Huh? It's the Nucleon! Oh! They'll be slaughtered! Commander Azuma's out there! Johnny, Giant Robot! Giant Robot, come! Confound it! The robot is moving! Oh! Here it comes again! Hit the dirt! -Are you hurt? -No, sir. Got to keep moving! There! Johnny, where is that robot? There he is. See? -Oh, Giant Robot! -Oh! After them! -Now, Johnny! -Giant Robot, the Nucleon! Up and away! Confound it! -He's coming closer! -Run! -Get to the car! -Hey, hurry! Now, Johnny! Giant Robot, you must stop the enemy at once. -Yeah, let's go, let's go! -Come on! -Let's get out here! -We got to get out of here! That's it. Giant Robot did it! Good! Great! [ALL LAUGHING] If they think they are through with the Emperor Guillotine, they're sadly mistaken! I shall never give up! And I shall conquer in the end! -This is nice, huh? -[BOTH LAUGHING] Yes. Ah! What is that? Oh, oh! [YELLING] [LAUGHING] Executioner, it's perfect. The earthlings will certainly be confused. Oh, I can see that. Although, why do we have to bother with the lake? You see, the Gargoyle vine is inactive in the water. The lake had to be completely drained. To bring the plant into action against these stupid earth men! Emperor Guillotine! We are doing well! Operation Lake was successful! We will soon reach our goal, to conquer this planet, Master! Don't make mistakes, Botanus! Remember, there is still much to do! Yes. Understood. Our plan now goes into phase number two, sire. It is very well prepared. I, Botanus, will not fail. [YELLING] -Oh, Commander! -Commander! -Commander! -How are you? Just a scratch. It's all right. I'm hard to kill. -You can go. -BOTH: Aye! Who do you think ordered the shooting, sir? -Bet it was the Gargoyle Gang. -Hmm. There's no doubt. It was the Gargoyles. Look. -What's that? -Hmm. This is the bullet that hit the car. I took it to ballistics for a check. [Botanus LAUGHING] -What? -What? Botanus: You are all doomed. Why not surrender? -Darn bullet! -No, don't touch it! It might explode! Botanus: You don't have a chance! Once the Gargoyle vine is turned loose, the earth will be demolished! Surrender now while you still can. We might let you live. [Botanus CONTINUES LAUGHING] Open it. Tape recorder inside it. So that's it. And he was talking about that vine! The space plant! Dr. Dorian is the one to talk to, Commander. It makes... It makes sense! Dr. Dorian knows just how it grows. Right. Well, you did quite well, Dangor. [LAUGHING] I think that bullet scared... Scared Commander Azuma as we'd planned. No? Dangor the Executioner, I'm a good shot. Good. And now you will go and kidnap Dr. Dorian, the great scientist. Go, right. [GASPS] Oh! What're you doing? No, please! Who are you? [GROANING] Come on! [GRUNTING] Come on. Take that, Unicorn. Look out! -The doctor! -Right! -Doctor! -Doctor? -Dr. Dorian? -Doctor! -Doctor? -Doctor! -U7! -Right! -Doctor, try to wake up! -Doctor? -It's all right, Doctor! -Doctor! -Dr. Dorian? -Doctor? Doctor! It's the Gargoyle vine! I thought it was dead! They must've brought in another Gargoyle vine. But how come it's just standing there? Yes, Dr. Dorian. The thing seems like it's dormant or something like that. Oh, yes, right now it is. It needs a source of additional energy. I understand. Doctor, could it be destroyed with bombs? No, no! The worst thing! That thing will draw energy and grow at any explosion! I know it would grow stronger! -It would? -Aye? We should stop the attack, you say? That's right. You really can't do it! It'll be a catastrophe! The whole story is just nonsense. Sure, those scientists keep trying to tell us what to do! You know? I just don't listen! Yes, we attack tomorrow morning. I will not listen to that old man! Listen to us! Please wait! Hello! Hello? -What's wrong? -Commander? Commander? What did he say? I'm sorry. That's it. They wouldn't believe that I know what I'm saying. They must think that Dr. Dorian is mad! Aye? No. Men like that minister are the ones who are mad! They should listen to the scientists! But I guess they won't. That's all. On target. Good hit! Oh! Go on! Make another bombing run! What? It destroyed all those airplanes? Yes, another air squadron was sent right on in. [AIRPLANE WHIZZING] [LAUGHING] Well, there goes another plane. When will they learn? They can't win against the Gargoyle vine. [SNICKERING] Report. All is well, Great One. We're winning! Those idiots attacked the Gargoyle vine! The second phase of our master plan and it went as expected. [LAUGHING] Good thus far, Botanus. Now launch the third phase into action! Yes. -Commander! The second attack squadron has been destroyed! -[ALARM BLARING] They can't hurt that Gargoyle vine! All towns have been evacuated! I see. Doctor? Well, it turned out as you said it would. That weird plant is growing! Doctor, Doctor! How can we stop that plant? We can't. We can't do it! Doctor! New orders! To all Unicorn branches. -On the alert. Condition Red status. -Aye! -U3. -Aye. Now Gargoyle might try to throw the area into panic. You must lead all our agents. -Help the refugees to safety. -Aye! -U7. -Aye! Take Giant Robot to the lake bed. Stand ready to assist all Unicorn agents. -Roger! -Roger! Oh... Commander, it's worse! That thing is throwing red-hot projectiles! No, what kind are they, Johnny? They're made of burning lava, sir. Can I have Giant Robot attack the plant now? Commander, let the giant robot attack! Right now! JOHNNY: The Gargoyle vine is getting stronger! -Commander! -Doctor? Give the order, sir! I'm sorry. The time is not right. U7, do not launch an attack until I order it! Aye! Oh, come on, follow me. Hurry. [ALL SCREAMING] This way. Follow me! Let's go! Hold it! Teacher! All the children are here, aren't they? Gozumi! Two are missing. -They are? -I must go! -No, don't! -Gozumi! -Oh, the children! -Wait! -No! -Teacher! -No! Let go. -You can't go! -It's dangerous! -Gozumi! Gozumi! Gozumi! CHILDREN: Oh! Help us! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Gozumi! Oh! Oh, Gozumi, go! Hey, teacher. Giant Robot, rescue the two kids down there! Giant Robot is here! CHILD 1: Look! Giant Robot! Hurry! Hurry! Now get aboard! Let's go! Oh, come on! -He did it! -TEACHER: He saved them! [GASPS] This is U7. The bombing is terrible! Your orders, please, sir? Please let me attack. Giant Robot can destroy that thing! JOHNNY: Commander! Commander! U7. Hold on. Johnny. Don't go near that thing! You understand? It's entirely too strong now! Oh! That darn plant! Oh! Commander, the dam is uphill. I'm sure Giant Robot could break it down and release the water. Commander? Just a minute! There it is! The dam is right there. That's it! It could work! The water held in that dam could easily pour down! That will make the heat energy go way down in the plant! Now then, that will cause the mouth to relax! Then when it opens, shoot rockets into the mouth! That'll do it! It will, it will! Good! That's it! U7, Commander here! -Destroy that dam right now! -Roger! Giant Robot, you will break the dam down! Giant Robot, power punch now! That's it! Good, Giant Robot! -Boy, look at that! -He did it! Giant Robot, you can start your attack. Giant Robot, now, hit him with rockets! [FIRING] You did it! Good work, Giant Robot! -Hooray! -Hey, great! It's all over! Hooray! Hooray, hooray! I will give you one last chance to destroy Unicorn! Yes. [GASPS] Oh! Oh! [ROARING] Ah! [GRUNTING] [ROARING] We swallowed up a whole express train. Unicorn will not know what happened. Doctor, I have our new prisoner here! Good. And I will handle the interrogation. We already know you're Suzuki, chief of the Unicorn Organization branch in Kyoto! And you're the only witness to our swallowing the train. How do you like that? Oh, no! You killed all those passengers in order to capture me? Humans wouldn't do that! No, they don't. And it's a good thing. Since Gargoylians do. NARRATOR: And so a train and all its passengers just vanished from the face of the earth. But Suzuki, sir, did he just disappear? Unicorn has planned a world conference. Kyoto was the location and Mr. Suzuki was in charge. Commander, there's something strange about this. There sure is. They caused that train to vanish. Just so that they could get Suzuki. Then Gargoyle must've done it. Hmm. So that means Gargoyle knew we'd been planning to hold this meeting, although it was secret. It means we must tighten security. I'm certain they will take much more action against us. We must take action. I am sending you two to Kyoto immediately. What they want is in there. That contains your orders and they are in code. Your orders are to decipher the code and proceed accordingly as is your profession. Aye. BOTH: Hail, Guillotine! [LAUGHING] Is it true the world Unicorn is going to hold a meeting? -Yes. -Where will it be? -Kyoto. -Where in Kyoto? -I don't know. -You don't? You must know that! I'm sorry. They won't stop me! I'll show Unicorn exactly how I operate! Good news! Doctor, we now know just where their headquarters are! Good. That does it. It'll be easy now. We're going to go get them! You, get him ready for surgery. Right. [MACHINES WHIRRING] Unicorn, let us start this session with a moment of prayer for our friend, Suzuki. With me. Who's there? -Suzuki! -It's our chief! Wonderful! Good to see you! I want to talk to you. -You will sit down. -Sure, sure. Listen. U3, Tokyo. I want to know all the details on this conference that we're going to hold. You know that it's all confidential information. I can't tell you anything right now. So don't you trust me? I must see the orders that are in that briefcase. I'm handling the plans for the summit meeting. JERRY: I can release these documents only on the Commander's orders! So, I don't like it. Where are you both staying in Kyoto? Oyo Hotel, Room 414. Oh, sir! It's really you, sir! It's good to see you! We thought you were dead! GIRL: Papa! WOMAN: I'm so glad! Go to bed. It's getting late. -Papa! Papa! -Mr. Suzuki, sir? I don't get it. I think my papa is sick. Dr. Botanus. Do you know where they are sleeping? 414 and it's the Oyo Hotel. Oyo Hotel? Who is he talking to? He said Room 414. I wonder who's in there. -Better check it. -Right. There's no bugs. Looks like it's safe enough in here. I wonder about that man! Suzuki, I mean! Yes. That's why I told him where we're staying. It's possible they got control over him. I'm not taking chances. No, we can't! -Then it looks like sure trouble tonight. -Hmm. You said it. Who ordered that? Must be a room mistake. I'm sure there is no mistake, sir. -[LAUGHING] -Huh? -Oh! -Drop the guns. [LAUGHING] I just came to get this case. Just what I wanted. And you get this! Oh! [GRUNTING] Stop. [GASPING] Let's get them! JERRY: They just vanished! -Doctor? -Yes? The briefcase contained only this! What? Oh! That is not exactly what you wanted, aye, Doctor? They'll be sorry about this, I assure you. They embarrass me. They won't get away with that! I'll send the Gorian into action again! You mean your papa's acting strangely? Yes, he looked like Papa, this man. He wasn't nice like Papa! Honest! What happened? Tell us. I don't know. He wasn't Papa. Not my papa. What are you doing here at this hour? Suzuki, you're acting suspiciously, sir. We must make sure you're our man. That's nonsense! Absolutely stupid! Why, you know I'm Suzuki! Don't you? I'm sorry. Rika, here, says you're not her papa, not at all. Huh? You must come with us, to headquarters. Why should I? [GRUNTING] Hey, taxi! All right, get in. -Oh! We're on the wrong road! -What? Now! Stop the car! Do as I say! I'm warning you! All right! Ah! He's been transmoculated. Just like me. His mind is under control. He underwent an operation, same as I did. Our bodies are not like yours at all. We are under Gargoyle control. Gargoyle? Communicator! Send a code to... I'm trying. Commander? U7 must be trying to mobilize Giant Robot. What? Do you know what you are saying? Oh, yes, sir. No question about it. It was too weak to activate the robot. U5, you're sure that it was a radio wave from U7 that you picked up? Yes! I'm positive! But that means that... Oh, Mr. Mano? U3? Hey, Johnny! Where are we? [LAUGHING] So you're awake, Unicornians. You are directly under Lake Biwa. Now, how do you like that? Dr. Botanus! Thank you. How nice you remember my name. How long you live now depends entirely on me. Oh. Now then. I want you to see this. [GASPS] Once the needle on this instrument starts to move, you will have five minutes to live, five minutes! [CLOCK TICKING] Watch it. Once it starts, it will not stop. Now do I get those documents? No. Do whatever you want! No matter what you do, you won't get what you want! Oh? That's too bad. You will die! [LAUGHING MENACINGLY] -He meant it. -So, I'm not going to be beaten! That's all. You call Giant Robot in quick! -But I can't do it! -Well, I'll fix that! Commander! The hotel room, sir! The attache case for the documents was there! That's good, and what about our agents? I'm sure that they're nearby. No, sir, I'm sorry. But... But they disappeared! Well, continue the search! We have an army out there! Kyoto was loaded with agents! -Tell them all to get busy! -Aye! The time is going by! Four more minutes! We will attack them in Kyoto and wipe them out. I'm going to break up that Unicorn gathering there by force! Okay, I'm ready! Go! And use the Gorian! Mmm. [SPLASHING] Commander, the men are all stationed! -Good, then let's get started. -Aye! Hurry, Jerry! -I did it! -Marvelous! Call, quickly. Giant Robot! Giant Robot! Giant Robot, Giant Robot, listen! Biwa Lake, we need you now! -Commander, we're picking up U7! -The giant robot? He'll be here soon! That means they're all right! -Not dead! -Well, then, uh, trace the signal! -Find out where they are! -Aye! [GROWLING] -Our tank corps is here, sir! -Oh. Oh! [ROARING] -Ah, over there! -Oh. [ROARING] One minute left. One minute! But we can make it! Giant Robot, destroy that Gorian! Thirty seconds more! [GROWLING] ALL: Hooray, hooray! We did it! [GURGLING] No! That robot's ruined things once again! Doctor! Doctor! The robot's coming here! What? [GROANING] [SCREAMING] Get Suzuki loose! The giant robot can take us all out! JOHNNY: Roger! Look at that! This is U3 and U7. Commander, you must have worried about us! Yes, I sure did. It's all right. -What about Suzuki? -Suzuki is here with us, but he's pretty weak right now. All right.We'll bring him to a hospital. Then his transmoculation can be corrected. Good. Roger. This is Unicorn Japan, Unicorn Japan! [BEEPING] Wait a second! That's not a Unicorn wave length! It's the Gargoyles! Then we must know where that signal originates. It could be getting ready to attack us! -Well, U3, U7! -BOTH: Aye! Use a portable tracker. -I want that signal located! -BOTH: Aye! [WHIRRING] Oh, there it is! [BEEPING GETS LOUDER] This is it! This is where that signal originates! All right. Come on, let's go! Here we go. Gee whiz! Pretty weird, isn't it? Yeah, it sure is. -[LAUGHING] -Come on out! Show yourself! In there! Welcome foolish agents of Unicorn! Shoot! Oh, a tape machine! Oh, I guess we've been fooled again! But why do this? -Let's go. -Hmm. -[JOHNNY GRUNTS] -Johnny! Are you hurt? Johnny? Urgent! Emergency! Please send an ambulance! WOMAN: Is Johnny hurt? Yes! Johnny's been shot! -Commander! -Not the boy! Hang on, U7! Courage! Oh, please don't die now! Robot won't listen to anyone else! We need you! Sniper reporting to our great emperor. U7 has been shot to death. He is, is he? Well, you show me his dead body! But... But, sir, sir, I... You idiot! They are taking him to a hospital! Make sure he's dead! Right. I will. Oh, oh! -Just making the rounds. -Yes, Doctor. This time I'll make absolutely sure you're dead, Unicorn agent! [GUN FIRING] -Oh, U7! -Hold it! -Halt! -You there! Well, the job is complete. Giant Robot, he'll be no trouble now. [CREAKING] Loose hood. That was close. This is U7 calling. U7 calling here, I'm in the enemy's car and I'm okay. He's all right. U7's a headache! I never know if he's alive! Aye, Pat, I wore this special jacket. You know, the iron one? When they shot me, but I wasn't hurt. All right. U7, where are you headed? JOHNNY: Probably right to Gargoyle headquarters. This guy thinks I'm dead. Good. The minute you get there, let us know. -Understand? -Roger. Looks like this is really it. AZUMA: We will attack as soon as we get the location from U7. Alert our forces. [LAUGHING] Unicorn morons! Don't they know that Guillotine hears every word they say? Fools! -[TIRES SCREECHING] -Oh! A monster? Emperor Guillotine! What is wrong? U7 was... U7 is alive in your trunk! You die with him. [SCREAMING] Oh, no! Oh, please, please, no! Oh, boy, I just can't get out! Robot! Giant Robot, I need you! Oh, please! Oh! Robot, red alert! Ah! Giant Robot is fighting the Gargoyle eye. It's going to be rough. U7, watch out! Gargoyle will mobilize all the monsters we had to conquer once before. It'll be dawn soon. Get rid of that eye! Robot, you must attack! Robot, mega-punch now! [LAUGHING] They're falling right into our trap! Oh, it's that saucer! Robot, look out! Lay down a smoke screen! Right. Commander, the saucer, big battle! U7. Do not weaken. Continue the battle at all costs. U7! Keep going! We'll soon be there! Oh, more Gargoyles! -Shoot that kid down! -Right. I'm in real trouble! Commander, enemy concentrated in the mountains! Quick! Location. It's 1-3-0-3, the mountain area! -Good. Go! -Aye! Snow, Commander! [SCREAMING] Oh, the monsters are coming out! Let's get out! Commander, look at that! We're entirely surrounded! U7! U7! Unicorn won't be bothering us much longer. Robot! Azuma's in real trouble! He needs you now! Yes, go and fight my monsters! Boys, just strike at them! [LAUGHING] Look at that! Quick, run, take cover! Idiots! Don't hit our own monsters! Take aim more carefully! -Oh, Robot! -Oh! [SCREECHING] [FIRING] Commander, don't worry about the monsters! Robot can handle that. Then we will attack the headquarters. -Well, sir, I'm ready! -Let's go! Robot, kill the monsters! Go! [GRUNTS] [GROANING] Oh! Attack! They're on the run! -Forward! -Fight! Fight, Gargoyles! Fight! Don't give up! Don't give up! Commander, Giant Robot licked those two monsters! That's good! Hear me out! Resistance is hopeless. Surrender! Or we will... Will destroy each one of you! Your one hope is to surrender! Nothing doing! Attack, let's go! Giant Robot! We're wasting time! Lay down your arms! Lay down your arms and come down! You! Where is Guillotine's saucer? I don't know. Straight line! Get going! [RUMBLING] [ALL PANICKING] Commander, look! It's a landslide! It's a saucer! And it's Guillotine's! Robot, attack! Robot, shoot it down! -It's done! -Guillotine is dead now! [GUILLOTINE LAUGHING] Earthling fools! This is your last day! It's Guillotine. Robot, attack! Destroy! Oh! Robot, what's wrong? -Robot! -You idiots! Ha! You fell right into my trap! Giant Robot has used up all his nuclear energy fighting my monsters! Oh! Robot has no strength! Well, then we'll do it. We can still win. -Attack! -Aye! You want to shoot me? My body's a mass of atomic energy! If a bullet hits me, my body will explode and the entire earth goes with it! Don't be ridiculous! You don't believe me? Then I'll prove it. Did you see that? You saw that? That was just a tiny fingernail! Commander, let's start shooting! Then the whole earth would be exploded! Giant Robot is helpless! From now on, people of the earth will obey orders from the mighty Emperor Guillotine! We're done. Nothing we can do. Robot! Looks like the tables are turned in our favor. Gargoyles, disarm those Unicorn men! ALL: Hail! -You won't need this. -Oh! Oh, I know! The robot has an auxiliary energy source! He's ready to go into action again now! -Oh, no! -Now I'll show you guys! Attack, Robot! Hooray, let's go! Nonsense! He can't attack me! If I am destroyed, the entire earth will blow up in a terrible nuclear explosion! -Do you hear? -U7, stop it quick! Robot, now stop! Don't do it! Stop the attack! I will destroy you all! Robot! What are you doing? Robot! Robot, where are you going? Robot, come back! Robot! Robot, please! Don't do it! You'll die! Robot! Robot, please come back! I need you here! Commander, that bright light! Guillotine is dead. And... Giant Robot! Robot, goodbye. I'm sorry you had to do it this way. Robot! Giant Robot! NARRATOR: And so the saga comes to an end. Giant Robot sacrificed himself to save the earth from the terrible Guillotine. But who knows? When Johnny desperately needs him again, perhaps, like a miracle, he will come back, out of the sky.
