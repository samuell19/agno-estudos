THE 100-ARMED GODDESS There I am, running. Running as always, as if a lion was chasing me. I run so as not to be late, so as to be early. On that day, I should have let the lion devour me. Vanina! Not there, I said! That's for clients only. - Mr. de Cordoue complains. - Yes, sorry. Messages from last night. Were you on a visit? I'm not your secretary. You have voicemail. Use it. Hello, Mr. de Cordoue. How are you today? Not too bad, thank you. Hello, Vanina. - Good morning, sir. - Please come to my office. Vanina, how long have you worked for us? Two and a half years or so. And how much would you say you've made for us? Very approximately? I don't know. Not too much, but you don't give me many opportunities. "Opportunities"? You want "opportunities"? I hope you realize this is is not a junkyard, but an exceptional real estate agency. I didn't mean that. Which needs exceptional collaborators. Are you one? Me? Well I... I don't know. No. Thank goodness. We're making progress. Oh, shit! Yes, mom. I'm in a hurry! Calm down, will you? You have to come by to program my television. Yes, mom. I had a hard day. This is not a good moment. It's never a good moment. I don't know how you manage to be so busy all the time. -Hello? Hello? I can't hear you! Mom? I can't hear you. Jody! Romain! Romain, I beg you, turn that thing off. I got a letter from the neighbors. Are you okay? What's wrong? I have my period. My belly hurts. Did you take a pill? I took the whole box and it still hurts. - I'd rather be dead. - Stop it, Jody. - Come give me a hand. - It hurts too much. You don't like to be helped. I had a terrible day, don't make it worse. Am I supposed to sing and throw flowers at you? I didn't say that, but look at your room. It's in the same state as everyone in this house: Romain, me, dad. A dog would become epileptic here. Leave your dad out of this. No! Poor dad, poor dad, poor dad, poor dad! What did the letter say? Everything alright? Huh? - Doesn't look like it. - Yes, well I... And there I was. I wanted to put my head on Greg's shoulder and tell him that I had just been fired, so he would comfort me and call me "darling". But no. I gritted my teeth like a brave little soldier. It used to be easy to become a little girl in his arms, and now it's so hard. Romain, come set the table! Romain, did you hear me? The existence of the Higgs boson has been confirmed. - Really? - Amazing, isn't it? Great. What is it, dad? They call it God's particle. It's what makes up... - The plates. - ...all the elements. What? Do you believe in parallel universes? Of course I do. - Could I have a double? - Yes. A doppelganger. That's crazy. - It really is. - If I tell that to my confessor, he'll crucify me. What? - You have a confessor? - Of course. Father Wozniak. Romain, I'd like you to keep me informed of your life. Let us know if you decide to take vows. - Don't you have to study? - Yes, English. I'll get up early tomorrow. The glasses. What do you need? Yeast and honey for a face mask. You'll come jogging with me tomorrow. That's better for skin than that recipe. What's wrong with her? It's for my belly. When do you intend to do a little exercise? At what time do we get up? - 6:30. - Oh, really? Will you wear your champagne négligé for me? Sure, if you want. - But it's not Thursday. - No, it's Wednesday. Wednesday, January 23. We can make an exception. Sure, why not? Relax with the kids a little. They raise themselves in some societies. Not in my society. What do you blame me for? Being blameless. You're like a 100-armed goddess. You should relax a little once in a while. Huh? What's the matter...? I was fired. I'll work until the end of this month. What did you do? Not enough profit. They give me these horrible estates which don't sell... We'll manage until you find something else. There's better than to sell Paris to the Russians. Don't you care at all? I was humiliated, treated like a wet rag, and all you think of is... - What do you want me to do? - I don't know. Just be more sympathetic. Show a little compassion. I told you the job's standards were too high for you. Oh right. And you want to know how the world was created. You are a wise man, and I'm an idiot. I have to play with toys for little children, or are they too hard for me? Is that what you want? An idiot who can't even use a can-opener? Excuse me, but with a degree in Planning you do have options. Don't you think? I just want a normal woman. You're not even sweet to me. It just doesn't come naturally to me. I'm different. Oh, so you're different. Now I'm the Invisible Man. A man you don't hold or even touch. Tell me the truth. Am I dead? Did I die and not notice it? - Did you remarry? - You're crazy. Did you forget that today is our anniversary? You complain. You dream of an ideal world in which trains are on time, children are obedient, and husbands are all tidy. It's not like that. The world is chaos. I know it all too well. I feel sorry for you. Is that what you want? No. Hey, Greg! I'm fed up. I'm leaving. The Invisible Man is going on vacation. What? You're leaving? Yes, I'm leaving. I'll come back when you say you love me and want to touch me again. You have 8 days to change. 8 days to change your nature! Not one more. Here. - What is it? - Your present. Life without Greg was simply unimaginable. Like breathing under water. I should have begged, wring my hands. "Stay, my love. Stay. Don't leave me." But no, I said nothing. I just let him go. I let the love of my life just walk out. You're ridiculous. Look at yourself. You've made a big mess. But you... This is not me. No, it's never you, is it? You're never to be blamed. You're just a victim. Who are you? I don't know. Maybe I'm your double. Or your better half... Call me Nina. I've come to re-educate you. I'm going mad. "Jennifer is late." What does that mean? I left you the car. Greg What does that mean? No idea. "Jennifer is late." I don't like English. I would have preferred Latin or Hebrew. Those are not useful. One shouldn't do useful stuff, but pleasant stuff. Yes, maybe you're right. What pleasant stuff would you like to do when...? - What is it? - Oh, it's nothing. Didn't you sleep well? You and your dad's nonsense gave me nightmares. - Really? - Yes. - What kind of nightmares? - I dreamed I had a double. That's not a nightmare. It'd be great to have a double. - Is dad still sleeping? - No. He left early this morning. In spite of being a 100-armed goddess, I had failed to retain Greg. I suddenly felt an unsettling presence behind me. The nightmare continued. I really did have a double, and she was following me. Could we slow down a little? We're not chasing anyone. What's the aim here? To have strong thighs? What good does that do? What do you want? Will you be around for long? Go ahead, play tough. I know you're dying inside. - Everything is alright. - So stop crying. I saw you with Greg last night. You looked like a corpse waiting to be incinerated. Well, he left me and I lost my job. Poor darling! And this is just the beginning. You took the wrong highway. That's why I came out. You made me lose it. - Put yourself in my shoes. - Whenever you want. You swallow all the fire you can, and never spit it out. So it eats you up inside. Not bad. - Spit some fire with him. - I'm scared of him. He's been staring at me for a year. Are you crazy? He could be a serial killer. It's good to take risks. Serial killers don't like whores. They like victims like yourself. I don't understand why he sees you and not me. I have no idea. Maybe I'm just nicer to look at. "Re-educate me"! Who does she think she is? I have never taken the wrong highway, and I am capable of spitting fire. Good morning! You have to prepare the rue Chanoinesse document. Gildo sold it. He's hospitalized. Do you want him to unplug his tubes? Oh, and we have to send Tchernov's offer to Delambre. Can't you do it? Of course not. I'm swamped. Those clothes don't suit you, they shorten your legs. Vanina! Vanina. I have a taxi waiting. I'm late. How is it going? Come, I'll explain. Hurry up! Béryl will give you the keys of the Anjou port. I have to go to Amsterdam, Gildo is hospitalized and emir al-Marouani's brother want to see the place. You'll do the visit. - Can you do it? - Yes, of course. Don't get too excited. You're still fired. How are you dressed? It'll do, I guess. You know how they are. Come. Come on. Come on! Why is that door so heavy? Is everything clear? You're walking on ice. - Take the deodorant spray. - For me, sir? No, for the property! When I passed by it smelled of dead rat. Come on, hurry! Yes. - Are you from the agency? - Yes. I'll present myself. Vanina del Pezzo, from Saint-Louis Real Estate. Come in, please. - How should I call your pal? - He's not my pal. And you can't address him because he won't answer. You will talk to me. Very well. Please follow me. This is the court of honor, where coaches used to stop. And this is the great stairway built in 1656 by Le Vau. The house belonged to Marquise de Richelieu, the Grand Cardinal's niece by marriage. She was so pretty that her dad had her teeth taken out in order to keep men away. A very savage procedure. This is the reception area, pure Grand Siècle style with French coffered ceilings. Well, you've seen everything. What are your impressions? Did you like it, ladies? Their opinion is not decisive. His Excellency says it faces north. That's not good. Plus, it's small. Small? 870 m2? His Excellency has an 11,000 m2 palace in his country. But we're in Paris. It's easier in the desert. We don't live in the desert. That's not what I meant. In Paris, maybe the Louvre has 11,000 m2. Could he also buy the house next door? I don't really think it's for sale. We would open this up and merge the two properties. Very convenient. These houses are listed. I think it's an académicien who owns it. - Make him an offer. "An offer"? How much...? - He just shrugged? - Yes. What did you tell him? The truth, that these are exclusive houses where you can't just open a hole. You can make holes anywhere if you have the money! With money, I could put holes in the Panthéon. What's the name of the emir's collaborator? He gave me his card, but it's in Arabic. Learn Arabic. - I already study Russian! - Too bad. You know what your problem is? You have no luck. I try hard, though. Exactly. I don't like sweaty people. I prefer someone lazy but lucky. Why do you insist on keeping that sole picture of me? I was 8 kg fatter then. Don't you have another one? Ms. Taïeb loves it. But Jean-Mau's are great! Your brother comes out better in pictures because he smiles. Okay. Hand me the manual. - Here. - Thanks. - What movie? - Well... The Trial: The Puy-de-Dôme Butcher. Don't erase the one from last week, we haven't seen the end. Ms. Taïeb fell asleep and I wouldn't watch it alone because it's shocking. Ms. Taïeb is like your mentor. Her son is the greatest gynecologist in Neuilly. He's an authority. He was interviewed on France 3. Instead of playing smart, you should go see him about... your indifference. - Does he cure indifference? - You know what I mean. I meant your frigidity. What? We can talk about it. Times have changed. Where did you get that idea? From Jody? Did she call you again? Well well... well done! Should I program the one on Sunday? No. Two would be too much. No. I prefer you to come again on Saturday. That way you'll get a chance to see me. Tell me... Could you lend me 1,500 euros until next month? "1,500 euros"? What do you and Greg do with your money? No! I'd have to give the same to your brother. Lend me half, then. We'll see on Saturday. If you stop annoying me! - Did anyone call me? - No. Is your brother not home? No. He's at his guitar lesson. Jody, could you maybe consider the idea... I don't know... the idea of vacuuming? I haven't taken Home Economics yet. Did you tell grandma that I was frigid? No, I said you were rigid. But she's dumb. Your grandmother is not dumb. I mean... not always. I heard you and dad screaming last night. We danced until late, yes. Did he leave? Are you guys separating? If you want my opinion... Who wouldn't? I hope you realize you're going down. What do you suggest, then? May I? Stop disfiguring yourself. Go get your eyebrows done by a specialist. Go see the esthetician on rue de Paris. She's really good. With the pocket money I get, I could never afford that. You should get an exfoliation, a face treatment. You must pay attention. It's important for you to feel safe and confident. Did you see Jesus last night? We'll go shopping together on Saturday. You have nothing to wear. I'm glad you finally realized what I go through. Leave me alone. That's not an education. Spending money can lead her nowhere really. - She's going to mention her cell. - I also need a smartphone. I have the same phone as Romain, who's 12 and uses it to recite prayers in Latin. While you chirp on Facebook all day with your boyfriend. That's normal at your age. Well, yes. Who is your boyfriend? The tall blond guy? - Erwan? - No, he's not my type. Good, what a relief. Not my type either. - He looks like a... - Like a dyed piglet. Plus, he's too young. Really? And how old is your boyfriend? You'll tell dad if I tell you. Of course I won't. I can keep a secret. I think that boy can help you mature. He's 38. 38 years old? 7 years younger than Greg! A pedophile! Of course I'll tell her father about it! Really? Well, not bad. Don't support her on this! I'm against it. Ask her if they've made love. And... have you made love? Uh... no. No. We will on August 6. The anniversary of Hiroshima? No, my birthday. - Oh. - Had you forgotten? We'll do it once I reach the age of consent so as not to put him at risk. We'll have time to lock him up before that. What's his occupation? He paints. Oh, so he's an artist! No, he paints houses. As far as money goes, it's more stable. Well, and while... you wait for August 6... do you share any extras...? A man his age can't be satisfied with just anything. Mom! Oh, come on! I know how it is. She's not even 15! Greg's absence hurt me all day long, but in the evening, it tore my flesh. I walked around the apartment. In the bathroom, I thought I felt his delicate smell. My heart contracted in pain. I had trouble containing my tears. Before forcing myself to go to bed, I took his cologne bottle and sprayed it all over my pillow. What are you doing? Are you mad? Don't you think it smells weird in here? No. We're out of light yogurt. - Oh, is that serious? - Well, yes. Tell me, has your father called you? No, he sent me an SMS. What did it say? Oh, something like "Good night, honey. "I am counting on you. "A kiss. Dad." Will you get the yogurts? Yes. Don't forget. This is yours. Mr. de Cordoue just called from Roissy. He's on his way. Did you make the photocopies? I don't make miracles. Although I'm a 100-armed goddess, I can't do it. I have a deal pending with Morton. I cannot budge. I'm not sure printed fabrics are the best for your figure. That flattens your chest. Come to my office with the quai d'Anjou file. I have a meeting in Compiègne at noon! We can't let this one pass. We have to win this! I have to win it. I don't need help. Stop playing the heroin. You're mad because I managed to make your daughter talk. You don't get along with her. I wonder if strangling your double is a crime. "I wonder if strangling your double is a crime." Who is this Academy member we have to make the offer to? I googled him and looked in the Bottin mondain. Gaultier Le Dantec, ex-senator, twice Minister of Economy, author of a few books on photographic techniques and of two poetry books. A widower in his sixties. An old rat who keeps his coat on to save on heating. Well, let's see. Since the emir is an oil millionaire, I'll make a nice offer to the académicien and he'll give us a commission when we sign the contract. I'll do it. Thanks, Vanina. I'll give you a little something. I don't want a little something, I want to close the deal! You're underqualified. We already talked about it. Well, if you never let me try... This is a delicate deal, it requires experience. Plus, you're too soft. I'm not as soft as you think. Did I tell you about rue de la Glacière ? No, but I saw the file. 6th floor, no elevator. That's not a problem, just make something up. Say that the owners want an elevator installed. In the 13th District, there's a Chinese family that will turn it into a workshop. Sell me that, and maybe I'll reconsider my decision. Nice performance. I see you've been defeated. Oh, get out. May I, now? - Knock knock. - Yes, what now? Have you ever heard of Tracfin, sir? What? Tracfin, the anti-laundering brigade of Finances. Sit down, sit down. Last year, it carried out 26,000 investigations. These are triggered as soon as an atypical transaction is reported. That is, by external reports. To the point, Vanina. There's a worrying case here. The Malinkov Investments file and the 18 million dollars that travelled from the Cayman Islands to Saint-Louis. Close your eyes, and you'll hear the sound of handcuffs. You've lost your mind. Maybe, but I will not lose my commission. Don't move. Stay here. You can't just appear whenever you want. You're ruining my life. You're not my tutor! Why are you complaining? You got the deal. Yeah, and I'll end up drowned in the Seine. I'm not a crime guild nor a blackmailer. Calm down! You're just dying of fear, that's all. You drown the life in you. You have no personal desire. You let yourself be oppressed by everyone and you have a rule book pinned to your heart. Careful, you're taking the wrong way! Are you happy now? Come on, hurry! Do you also want to get a ticket? Okay, you can slow down. We left him behind. Romain is waiting for me. Can't he take the bus? He won't hesitate to put you in a retirement home! Don't you want to go have a glass of white wine? No, I'm not irresponsible. Oh, I noticed that. Margaret Thatcher was more irresponsible than you. Why did you come into my life, anyway? - I'm an expeditionary corps. - A what? An expeditionary corps. I've come to open the fortress to which you're chained. I am not chained! You liar! Your life is chained and so are your dreams, even your cells are. Why don't you just relax! So, shall we go have that glass of wine? - Will you walk with me? - I'm waiting for my mom. - Will she come? - She said 4:10. You'll see. She'll be here in 6 seconds. 1, 2... 3, 4, 5... 6. Here she is. Wow! You're lucky. Mine can't even boil an egg. - Bye. - Bye. Hi, dear. Did you have a good day? The usual. I explained the quantum theory and the teacher laughed at me. I have almost good news. I got a big deal in progress. If I succeed, I'll receive an important commission. I'm a little nervous... Take me to Jonathan's. I'm sleeping over. We had it planned. Oh, yes, it was planned. Invite him over some day. As long as you don't scream like the other night... We'll be careful not to. What do you do with Jonathan? Play video games? Not at all. We're building an altar. Oh... an altar??? An altar: A-L-T-A-R. With a ciborium and all. But we still need a relic. For 24.90 euros we can get sawdust from Bernadette Soubiron's coffin on the Internet. I see. Is that how you spend your pocket money? On coffin sawdust? It's not really my business. I could buy hash, too, if I wanted. And what's this Jonathan like? When he wears his communion alb, he seems to glow. Did you bring your things? Toothbrush, drops? Affirmative. - Don't go to bed too late. - Bye. See you. Don't forget to say your prayers! Well, it's obvious that he likes boys. Thanks. I hadn't noticed. You were hoping I wouldn't notice it. Well, it's no big deal. We're not in the 18th Century. Talk about ancient Greece and I'll hit you. Don't you feel like having a dessert? No, I don't want to gain weight. Yeah, women punish themselves like that. But men prefer fat ladies. I feel like a badly assembled ready-made shelf. I tried to study Arabic, but Greg's absence was like a dentist's drill. When he came back, my heart jumped. But we just exchanged muted greetings and I pretended to be concentrating on my lesson. You attack first. Jody has a lover your age. They plan to make love on August 6, at midnight. Great, they're organized. I see you're not shocked. She's turning 15, right? The age of consent. You seem well informed. What could you expect, with a mother like you? It looks more like she's missing a father. What are you doing? There's only 6 days left. - Don't put pressure on me. - Let me do it. Wait. - When did she tell you? - I don't know. Yesterday. It's better for her to start with an experimented lover. What about us? Do you really want us to separate? You pig. I don't know, Vanina. I feel a little lost. Come here. If we're going to separate, we better start with something unforgettable. What's the matter with you? Nothing. You're acting strange. Does that scare you? Don't you like changes? I don't know. How about if we visit a swingers' club? I'll need to think about it. Don't tell me you've never considered it. Maybe I have. I'm going to do something your wife has never done. What are you saying, Vanina? - That's how prostitutes talk. - Do you know prostitutes? Yes. Oh, it's too good! So, do you like your 100-armed goddess? Oh, this is good! Just feel the pleasure. Hey, will you have an orgasm for me? Hey, I'm talking to you! This is my man! Oh, okay! I'm leaving. What's the matter? Nothing. I don't like how you looked. You scared me. What? The way I looked...? We were like two strangers. You wanted to go to a swingers' club! What you say at such moments doesn't count! Plus, you started it! Well, it was a trap. I wanted to see your real face. No way, I'm dreaming. No, this is not true. So now you're setting traps... - Maybe you already went... - Oh, you're mad! You're mad! You're mad, Vanina. You are the incarnation of perversity. So long. No, Greg! I will not stay with you for a second longer. No, Greg! Where are you now? Where did you go? Hey! Are you calling me? - What happened in here? - Nothing. - Your father cheated on me. - What? - With whom? - That doesn't concern you. Maybe you should try to be... I don't know. Cooler, more coquette... No, no, that's enough. Mind your own business. The day after, I felt as if I had fought 5 rounds against Mohamed Ali. Things had to change. That woman just appeared and made love to my husband. What was I supposed to do? Can I borrow your phone? Mine is about to die. Tell me whom he cheated with. No. - Do I know her? - Leave me alone. I wouldn't make a big deal out of it if Karol did that. - Who? - The person I told you about. Karol? Is it a woman? No, Karol with a K. He's Polish. Oh, he's Polish? And he's not a plumber? You disappoint me. You're becoming a fascist. I phoned the agency, excused myself for once, and went jogging to sweat out all my misfortune. I will never manage to get Greg back. She didn't tell you whom with? She refused to. I found nothing on her phone. - Jody! - Quiet, here she is. Jody, please turn it down. The neighbor will kill us. Romain, stop! - We're working. - And you need inspiration? - Hi, Malika. - Hello, ma'am. Make her work, please. I don't even dare to show her report to her dad. - Anyways, dad... - Dad what? Nothing. Your phone rang and I answered. - Who was it? - Some Chinese guy. Are you sure he wasn't Arab? I know the difference between Chinese and Arab. I'm running. And I'm late for the first time in my life. Hello. I miss Greg, that bastard. No. I must not think of him, or I won't succeed here. Hello! - Are you here for the visit? - Yes. All of you? Oh, yes. Okay. I think this is the door. Excuse me. No, no, no. Not in there. Not the water, no, no. No, don't touch that either. Oh, no. No, no, no! There are many floors. Many. Ma'am, ma'am. No, no. The owners have voted to install an elevator. Yes. They all agree. It's a good apartment! Get down. Come on, get down. There. Yes. Yes, mom, I'm coming. - Did Greg leave you? - Who told you that? - Jody? That girl...! - That's horrible. I cannot believe it. What will become of you? Yes, ma'am. What a catastrophe! Vanina, are you listening? There are millions of women in my situation. Plus, I'm not an idiot. I'll manage. Mom, I'm driving. I must hang up, okay? See you. So... Yes. It leads to a storage area for luggage and the kids' toys. Dangerous. Kid fall, dead. This is Greg del Pezzo's voicemail. Leave me a message and I'll call back soon. Yes, Greg. It's me. No, nothing. Nothing. Oh, it's you, finally. Hi. I was getting worried. Come, quick. My poor darling. Men are such a mob! Don't start saying he's right. What do you want? A zlabia, a corne de gazelle, a makroud? No thank you, I'm fine. Well, uh... Ms. Taïeb thought of someone. "Someone"? Yes, to replace Greg. Are you hallucinating? No, listen. Stop playing smart with me. That hasn't helped. What did I tell you? He's a very nice gentleman, a chief accounting. Miskin. He's a young widower. He's a very suitable party. He won't touch you unless you want it. Thank you, Ms. Taïeb, but I'm not interested. I understand, darling. Whenever you're ready. Love makes time fly and time makes love pass away. Did you see your film on Thursday? No, you did it wrong again. We got a porn film instead. There was a guy who had a horse-sized penis. My goodness, that requires a lot of appetite. We laughed so much, didn't we, Ms. Fourrier? We missed the end, too. Well, I'm going back home. The Sabbath is almost over. Good luck, Vanina. Just call me if you need me. No, don't move. I know the way out. - Good-bye, dear. - Good-bye. - I'll program for tomorrow. - I'll manage by myself. Oh, wait. Here. There's 1,000. Oh, thanks. - And please don't worry. - Of course not... - Your brother's cholesterol... - That can be cured. He's like you, he doesn't want a cure. - Cure? Me? - You know what I mean. If you were less indifferent, men would not leave you. Why men? And I'm not indifferent at all! I'm not frigid, nor perfect, nor bad! I do what I can! You're indifferent! You only want me here to program your TV. And you only come for your check. Don't you understand this is an disability pension? A what? You've made me an invalid. You owe me a pension. I left with a great feeling of relief, as if I had been wearing tight shoes for 40 years and I had just taken them off. Not bad. It won't be useful, but it feels good. - Did you miss me? - No. Greg left again. I would too if I were him. - You want to take his place? - You still love him, huh? - So tell him. - I tried, but couldn't. - Force yourself. 5 days left! - Oh, right. After what happened yesterday, do you think he'll come back? You wouldn't deserve it. - Make him jealous. - It's Romain's theory. I think that's childish. When you're in love, you're always 6. Where is dad? I have no idea. Hurry up, I'm tired. If he doesn't have another girl, I pity him. No slippers, no socks, no food... - He has food, don't worry. Cédric's dad left his wife and went to live with a guy. His mom now has another man. So Cédric has 3 dads now. And he's okay with it. Yes. Eat. Are you in favor of gay marriage? Listen, at this time, I don't really care. Wozniak is against it. He's in favor of celibacy for priests. At the moment he was freed and entered his passion... My God, I only have 4 days left. Help me succeed. I beg you. Help me succeed. ...and gave it to his disciples saying: "Here, eat. "This is my body." That's Father Wozniak. Do you like him? He looks like Tom Cruise. Just a bit fatter. "You will do this in remembrance of me." I would have liked to see dad. Will he stay? No. He just came by to pick up his stuff. - All his stuff? - I don't know. Enough now. Pray. If he takes everything, you'll never see him again. Hello, Romain. Let me take a look at you. Hello, darling. Hello, dear Romain. Is that your mom? She's really pretty. - Do you have a girlfriend? - Not yet. It'll come. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. See you. - Where do you live now? - Here, there... - Okay, I get it. - What do you get? There's nothing to "get". You can tell me everything. - I know how life is. - Your mother told me. You're going out with a 38-year-old, right? She's crazy! She's going nuts. Don't worry. I won't stop seeing you as a hero, even if you have a lover. Do I know her? If I had a lover, darling, I wouldn't tell you about it. Why didn't he want you to stay? You could have helped him pack. He must be scared of being found out. You think so? Or he's scared of regretting his decision. It's possible. You're stronger than him. Really? Do you also think so? Listen, I have an idea. Let's go back now. That way, you'll run into him and try to seduce him. It's a good plan, right? Right? You bet. Is everything alright? Why wouldn't it be? Has he left? A long while ago, in a cab. And... how did it go? He took some clothes and papers. He didn't sign a discharge. Did he say anything? No. Oh, yes. He said you're crazy. That's all? Hey, I'm going out with Karol. We're going to the movies. I'd like you to meet him. He wants to meet you, plus that will distract you. Thanks for the offer, but I don't feel like it. Why? Are you taking revenge? I do not approve of this extravagant relationship. You're doing this because dad is not here. You're the one who chased dad away. Jody, I don't even want to talk about it. You don't even know what's good for you. - Oh, and do you? - Enough, Jody. It's obvious that you've made good choices in life. I will not discuss this. Go do some work, since you don't have your period. - Yes? - Are you done screaming yet? - My wife has nerve problems. - So do I. Poles are against abortion, did you know that? - There's pills and condoms. - Yeah, right. The guy is immature. He must be somewhat stupid to go after a 14 year-old, at age 40. She'll feel rejected. I can't approve of it! Complicity in minor corruption would get me 15 years in jail. Think about it. It's always best to know your enemy. Come on, let me do this. Jody? Hey, Jody! Okay. He can come over. I'm not too sure, you're not being coherent. It's okay. Call him. Is it not a trap? Will you receive him normally? Like a prince! With folk dancing, too. Okay, but go change. You look embarrassing. Where are the golden cups? Somewhere in there. Unless your dad took them. Mom, this is Karol. Karol, my mom, Vanina. I'm completely delighted to have this opportunity. Please, come in. Have a seat. Thank you. - You want some tea? - Yes. I must say he's not bad. With milk? No, thanks. I drink it pure. We say "straight". Mom, do you also want some? Yes, yes. Thank you. - Was it easy to get here? - Oh yes. Directly. With the GPS, porte de Bagnolet, and boom! Va... Vania. Vanina. It's okay. You must know that my intentions with her are completely "straight". Sorry? Don't be so stuck-up. He's having a hard time. But he's adorable. Pure. We say "pure". Oh, I'm sure they are. Is it the first time you come to France? No. I came for the first time in 1998 as a football fan. So you like French football? That's wonderful. Franck Ribéry is excellent. Do you agree? Sure. He's like a machine! Are you from Warsaw? No, from Skierniewice. Oh, yes. Skierniewice... Skierniewice. Poland is a wonderful country! Such courageous people, great culture, beautiful landscapes! - And what artists! - Oh yes. And there was a French king who was king of Poland. Of course! And Dracula. What a fascinating character! He's Rumanian, mom. Really? Oh! Sorry. But I love vampires. As a child, I dreamed of being caught by one. That must be a very exciting sensation. One bite at the neck, and you find ecstasy. What do you think, Karol? Well, I... - I'd never thought about it. - What a nice name. Karol, with a K. It's masculine and feminine at the same time. Oh, what is this? You have the hands of a pianist, my dear Karol. Like Chopin. Hands made... to caress. That one was Polish, right? Am I not mistaken? Is something wrong? - What's the matter? - No. I just have... to urinate. You need the toilet? Oh, I'll take you. - No. - No! Come, Karol. I'll show you. Just leave. This is fucked up! Have you no shame? What kind of show is this? Are you seducing him? Come on, calm down. What did you expect? I had to talk about something. Not like that. You look like an imbecile nymphomaniac. - I'm ashamed of you. - I needed some distraction... - You were hitting on him! - Do you want my opinion? - That guy is not for you. - Much less for you, then! You're too old. Dad was right. You're gone. Come, Karol. Let's go. At least it's obvious that she has no sense of humor. None. And don't you slap her next time. The neighbor. - Should I answer? - No, please! I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. Are you mad? Greg's absence made our bed feel like a park bench. I decided to write to him. "My dear Greg..." No. That sounds recriminatory. Let's see. "My love". No. He won't believe that. "My darling", that's simple and chic. That works. Yeah right. It sounds like a teenage pregnancy. The next morning, I was convinced I had to go ask for his forgiveness. Do you want my advice? - No. - Don't say "I was working nearby and thought we could have lunch." - Was that your intention? - No. Don't tell him that you'll kill yourself, either. You'll scare him. You should say: "Greg, "I want us to go to a hotel and spend an hour together "like we used to when we weren't a family." You think so? What if he refuses? That would be impolite. In that case, ask him if any of his colleagues might... There he is. Well... there I go. Wish me good luck. Shit! Who is that girl? - It's Malika! - Malika? Jody's classmate. What is she doing here? She's only 15. - She looks older. - Why do they like old men now? - They just kissed. Did you expect them to get naked and roll on the floor? Greg and Malika... This is a nightmare! He's telling her about the creation of the universe. I recognize those gestures. It doesn't interest her. Stop it. You're going to overflow the Seine. - Now I get it. - What? He already knew about the age of sexual consent and all. He must have studied the penal code. She'll do all the things I loved to do to him. And the ones you didn't. Here. - What is it? - Crumble. There were no almond croissants. 650 calories. Even Ms. Taïeb will think I'm fat. There. He was so cute when I saw him the first time behind that shop window. He worked in a big store to make a little pocket money. He was arranging the display, barefoot. He was trying to put underwear on a mannequin. It was the most erotic sight I had ever seen in my life. I don't get it. Going to bed with kids must make him feel older. Girls must scare men less than us women. - That's all. - Stop saying "us". You're not being cheated on. You don't even exist. And you have 3 days left. - What do you want? - She... Get out! - Mom! - Come on! - Out! You hear? - What...? She's the one your dad is seeing now! You're losing it! I'm not making it up. What were you doing with him? What were you two doing? - Let me go! - Stop! Enough! She went to see dad to interview him about a Nobel Prize winner! - What winner? - A physician. Serge Haroche. Sure, Serge Haroche. Is Jody still not home? No. - What time is it? - 2:15. Will you call the police? No. Not yet. She must be at a disco, taking revenge... Taking drugs, or worse... "Worse"? Some 13-year-olds prostitute themselves. Well, that's reassuring. Well, if I was in her shoes... If you rejected Jonathan... Do you love him that much? I'm not sure. Love is not bad, but I find sex disgusting. So do I. I'll go talk to her. I can help her. No, Romain. Don't play the priest now, please. Leave her alone and go to bed. It's late. Frigid, indifferent, unworthy mother... I'll have to lie a lot on my Meetic profile. In the meantime, I must win that contract at the agency. I'll just think about money like Mr. de Cordoue. Then Béryl will come begging to see me. Hello. Vanina del Pezzo, from the real estate agency. I have an appointment with Mr. Le Dantec. Welcome to Bluebeard's palace. Good day, sir. Yes, call me "sir". I love that. You're a real beauty! We will talk over there. I still have 1 or 2 rooms. This way please. - After you. - Thank you. - May I? - Thank you. Sit facing the window. I will stay in the shadows. "For you, the sunrays bathed in splendor; "for me, just dust, "a dusty spider." - Excuse me? It's Victor Hugo. - Have a seat. - Thank you. It's La Chanson de Maglia. "You are beautiful indeed, unlike me, a frightful sight." Not really, no. So, you find me likable? Thank you. I'm definitely very lucky. Come on, stop that. You have nice thighs. Let him enjoy himself. Don't you want to do business? Stop it now. You've already done enough. Thank you. So you would like to buy my town house? Well, not me. The brother of emir al-Marouani. I came to make an offer. Do you think he'll like it? That man has strange taste. I told him the emir wanted to merge the two properties. He didn't seem to listen. He seemed to be imagining how he could get me naked, hang me, and eviscerate me. And how much would you be willing to pay? Well, we thought about making an offer... Come on! Yes, you make me languish... Well, we're ready to offer even... More, more. He's a pig. Go up! 19 million euros. 19 million, for this slum? Idiot! You must want it bad. What is your name? Va... Vanina. Vanina, have you ever posed naked? Excuse me? Say yes, say yes. Say yes! I want to show you something. But... - I can't do that to Greg. - He did it to you. He's never done anything. What about the swingers' clubs? He's never been to one. He wouldn't brag. - Plus, I'm not a whore. - Oh, come on! One picture doesn't count. And at 19 million euros... you'd make the Guinness. Take a look and give me your honest opinion. I took them myself... in the old style. I have a small photo studio upstairs. - They're sensational. - They're disgusting. Damn! Shut up! I don't have such a good body, of course... Let me be the judge of that. You fool. You are almost there. - Did I hurt you, Gaultier? - "Gaultier"? I'm surprised. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It was a bad reflex. It's just that you're very assertive. Sorry. Sorry. I am really two women. One really wants to please you and the other has scruples. - Well, make a compromise. - I'm so upset. My heart will explode. Touch. Touch, touch... Okay, that's enough. Are you crazy or what? No, just nervous. Nervous... Can you feel the terrible contradiction I must endure? - I feel the slaps, no doubt. - Oh, don't get angry. It's like finding yourself with twin sisters. I'm sure you've dreamed of it, haven't you? I won't deny it. Come on, let's sign the protocol and I'll do the pictures. No, no, no. 19 million really is quite an amount. 20. So, you want to punish me? You are such a meanie! Okay, 20 is fine, just so you'll forgive me. I'll have the document made, we'll sign it, and immediately after... snap snap! We won! We won! It's great. We're rich. Cordoue won't fire me and he'll give me at least 400,000 euros in commission. No more limitations. It's time for luxury, parties, trips, palaces. I'd love to visit the Australian desert to look for opals. It's my dream. Okay, let's go there. We won! We won! We won! People will think we're PSG supporters. It would still be money from the Emirates. Where are you going? I'll be right back. Mr. de Cordoue, we got it. The man agreed. Yes! I just talked to him. 20 million. We can sign on Thursday, but it must be at his place. Yes, it's great! Okay, see you. No. Wait, wait. No. I'll drink from my shoe. There! Thursday we'll sign, but I'll never do the photos. - No, no, you're doing them. - It's a matter of ethics. - He could draw back. - You won't say no. - What about Greg? We'll see about Greg. As your daughter says: Money comes first. Stop, stop. This is so good! - The window. - Oh, yes... There. Hello, ma'am. National police. Do you intend to drive in that state? What state? You just emptied a bottle. But there's two of us. "Two"? Yes... Two. If they find Greg, they'll ask him to come get me. Well, 8 days have passed, my darling, and I'm sobering up for you in a prison cell. Doesn't that prove that I love you? When do you get out today? 4 pm. You could wait for Romain and we could go shopping together, huh? - We'll see a movie and eat. - I don't need anything. Not even a leather jacket? Did you rob a bank? I'm selling two houses in one shot. I can use my overdraft, I called the bank. Jody... Jody, I'm ashamed of what happened. Just for today, could I... hold you in my arms? - Will you behave? - Yes, of course. And stop acting crazy? Okay. My darling... - Are you happy? - Yes, this is great! Great! Karol will be amazed. Oh, mom! Get them, get them. You look fabulous. "Karol will be amazed!" It's a 19th Century reliquary with the remains of Saint Vaast. Do you realize, mom? Clovis' preceptor! Jonathan will be amazed! Are you going to leave all those oysters? - Are you not hungry? - I am... What's the matter, then? It's dad. What's the matter with dad? Well, that he's not here. When I woke up, I was indebted for a year and I had a pair of shoes that I could only wear to Lady Gaga's wedding. I wanted to hear Greg's voice, so I called him. He didn't answer. I just said: "It's me" to his voicemail. I should have said "I love you. Come back." But when you're 6 years old... Please sign here. There. I'm homeless. Sir, it's been a privilege to meet you. Good-bye, sir. I'll see you at 4 pm. Snap snap. Sleeping with an Immortal? You're brave. I couldn't. Oh, come on. Excuse me. Hi, dad. How are you? - How are you, dear? Busy? - No, no. Could we perhaps have lunch together next Sunday? - Well... I can't, really. - Why not? I'm going to see a show with mom and Valentin. Who is Valentin? It's mom's new boyfriend. Hasn't she told you? No, no. He's a really cool guy, a highly trained athlete. He was received at l'Elysée by François Hollande. - Wow! Really? Cool. No problem. We'll have lunch the Sunday after, then. Okay. Okay, a hug. A hug, dad. Fuck. That bitch... This is Bluebeard's chamber. I don't keep my ex's corpses, as you can see. Please, follow me. Right this way. Go ahead. This should fit you. You must be 38 small, right? May I? I'll wait next door. Make yourself pretty. And take your time. I could never do this. Never. Don't be so prude. Think about the money. Come on, take your stuff out. I feel like I'm with Landru. You get on my nerves, Vanina. Relax a little. Hello? Yes. Béryl? How are you? Hello, Mr. del Pezzo. Not too well, actually. I have a neuroma and... Do you know where my wife is? I can't reach her cell. No. She's left already. It's hard for her to keep still these days. Really? Oh, wait. She had a visit at 4 pm. Let me check. I found the address. 6, quai d'Anjou. You might still catch her. How do I look? Let's just say you look reasonably obscene. I'm so embarrassed. So does pleasure start. - Go on. - I have to relax. - Let me just say my prayers. - Go on! Come in. Turn around. You kept your underwear. I charge 20 million to take it off. Well, that's not bad. Just "not bad"? To pose naked is an occupation that requires some panache. Please lie on the meridienne in a suggestive pose. Lie down. That's not suggestive at all. You look like a shaved poodle. I want something sensual, you see? No, no. I mean sensual. You are too funny. I'm not comfortable, this thing is too tight. It's like a punishment. Some music? The Mass of the Dead. Well, I don't know. Just make a little effort, will you? Just a small effort. Put your arm behind your head. There! And smile. Try to think of something nice. Like: "Oh, if only my kids could see me!" There. Not bad. That's not bad. Not bad at all. - Lift your thigh a little. - No thanks. What? What is it? It's a sultan surrounded by women. They want to see the house. Just what I needed. Okay, I'm coming! No, keep the pose. There. I'll see them off and be right back. Do not move. We came for the visit. Oh... yes. Yes, yes. Well, please come in. Please come in. You sure are many. I'm... looking for my wife. - Is she here? - Who's your wife? Who are you? Where is my wife? Is he with you? - I don't know this man. - If it's that whore... she's upstairs. - Vanina! - Vanina! - Where are you going? I'll call the police. - Vanina! - Greg... I'm hearing Greg's voice. I'm lost. Vanina! Where are you going? We came for the visit, and visit we will. Ma'am, sir, please... Vanina! I'm lost. If he sees me, I'm lost. Vanina? Vani... I'm sorry. I'm looking for my wife. Vanina! Vanina, is it you? Vanina? Vanina? Vanina? Stop that immediately. Calm down or I'll kick your ass. Just you try. Are you Valentin? Who's Valentin? Who are you? - Is it him? - Don't get near his Exce... Are you the athlete? It's over, okay? Vanina. What are you doing dressed like this? - I can explain. - What is this place? A swingers' club? - Not at all. - Who is Valentin? "Valentin"? - Your boyfriend. - I don't have one. What...? - Romain said... - He was making you jealous. Yeah, go ahead, take me for an idiot. Greg, wait! Greg, wait, please. Greg, wait, I beg you. Wait, wait. I'll tell you the truth. I'll explain. Tell me. Let's see what you'll make up this time. Okay, look, it's complicated. There's someone between us. That Valentin guy? No. - Who is it, then? - It's me. Stop confusing me. I'm not! Plus, you cheated on me with her. Who are you talking about? Me! It's me! - You're crazy. - No. Wait. Wait. Maybe, I don't know... but I love you. I love you, Greg. I love you. Oh yes, it's good! Yes, it's good. I knew she had talent. Oh, I love you! I love you! The emir's brother retracted and the deal fell through. But the Chinese did buy on rue de la Glacière. I got a 15,000-euro commission which allowed me to pay for my wild shopping spree and a two-week vacation in Italy. Greg attributed my story to a personality disorder due to stress, which is probably true. I never saw Nina again. She just disappeared. Sometimes I order a glass for her to see if she'll show up. But no luck. Can I have another one? Won't you drink that one? - Oh no, I couldn't. - Why? Is it corked? No. Don't worry. Everything is fine. Thank you. I'm still like a badly assembled ready-made shelf. But now, thanks to her, I don't care. She turned me into a new, lighter woman, who is conscious of the value of every moment in life.
