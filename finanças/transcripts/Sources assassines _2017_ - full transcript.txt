DEATHLY SPRINGS I'm trying to stay neat. There. You're very ugly. Don't be afraid, Alban. This disguise is to make fun of death. To say it doesn't scare you. See you later. - Hey, you OK? - Yes. All's well? - Séléna? - Yes. - Don't forget your drip. - Don't worry. I'm going back to the practice. - Bye, Dr Duroc. - Bye. One evening, a man sat down at the foot of the fairy rock. He was overwhelmed with pain. His one-year old child was dying. A fairy saw him and asked him what happened. The man explained his grief and couldn't hold back his tears, that spouted out a clear spring when they touched the ground. "Take this water to wash your son. "In a few days, he will be revived", the fairy explained, before disappearing, too. The third fairy enquired about the man's pain, whose tears, once again, spouted a spring. When bathing him in the third spring the child smiled at him. His son was cured! And thus was born La Bourboule. Beware whatsoever: where there are fairies, there's the devil too. Thanks, doctor Volkov. - If you don't feel well, come back. - Thanks. We've noted about 50 cases of poisoning. How can that be? 10 years ago, we had salmonella. We'll get the results of the tests tomorrow, but there's no high fever. I don't think it's viral. Has the arsenic in the water increased? All the patients have had either at the spa or here. I must inform the health office. Sophie, it's a necessary precaution, I must order the temporary shutdown of the spa. - Right. Bye, Mr Mayor. - Thank you, doctor. Irène, Xavier's disappeared. He's not answering the phone. He must be on a call on the mountains. Don't worry. - Mrs Renard. - Commander Garnier. We've come with the health department officers, in case it is a malicious act. Many complaints were filed yesterday. Come. Let's go to the installations in the basement. This way, ladies and gentlemen. Xavier! Six missed calls Right. OK. It's clear for me. He had a heart attack. From the rigor mortis, he must have died yesterday. Anything to do with the poisoning? Possible. His doctor says his heart was weak, he was taking anticoagulants. The autopsy will tell us more. Found the clothes? Nothing. I searched all the lockers. I doubt he wore his birthday suit at the party. Especially in front of the kids. Irène Volkov, you know her? She's a doctor at La Bourboule. Alright. Irène Volkov Today 0:48 - Missed call I'm Mrs Gilot, public defender. Can you get me out? I've got patients waiting for me. I'd rather have something else. I'm checking your rights are respected. Did you see a doctor? - I'm a doctor. - True. They suspect you of poisoning Duroc, child psychiatrist, with an arsenic medicine. I used to heal my lupus patients with that medicine. This product is the cause of 50 cases of poisoning the eve of your arrest. A child was admitted to hospital. The police claim I'd disguised the crime by causing mass poisoning. It's ridiculous. You refused to answer their questions. Why didn't you cooperate? I'd have done it if they hadn't stupidly arrested me. You'd like to inform your family? No. Clermont-Ferrand, 4 minutes' stop. Connecting train to Saint-Étienne at 7:14, platform number 2. Lyon Part-Dieu at 7:18, platform 4. Please use the underground passage. Fanny Volkov? Yes. I'm Séléna Rome. Irène's a grandmother? She doesn't know. A symptom of my lupus. I'm used to it. It's an autoimmune disease. The marks get worse in the summer, even with sunblock. You take part in medical tests with my mum? Yes, using an arsenic trioxide compound. I spent 1 month at the Clermont hospital, and since one week, it's being followed up in La Bourboule. Irène offered to put me up. She spoke much about you. I'd rather you tell me about her arrest. They must have been there a while. I was with another patient, on a drip. - How crazy! - Please. I want that too. I need access to all the documents. This can't be... The key, please! There. Oh my... Arsenic. POISON As from now, you are taken into custody. Captain Balhul will seize your computer and you give me your phone. - I can't leave my patients. - Please. Don't touch me! Madam, how long will this take? Right. Follow me, now. Good. The keys of my car are on my desk. Then, the captain questioned us on what Irène did that eve. She was called to town in the night, about a poisoning. Dr Duroc tried to reach her before 9pm. I answered. He couldn't get her on her mobile. Then, they searched the house. They made such a mess! Did my mother manage to see Xavier Duroc? I don't think so. I was with her when the spa manager gave her the news. She fainted. I'm off to the hospital. I'll pick you up on my way back, madam. No, it's OK. I'll manage. No need to be formal. Yes. Fanny! I can't believe you're here. You should've told me. - So this is yours? - Yes. No, I found it in the street. Fine. Let's make a declaration. - Hope you didn't steal it? - I did, I admit. Left the CID? No, I'm just on maternity leave. Everybody, this is Fanny, my former partner in Lille. - Hi. - Hello. Come home tonight. I've got everything you need. - Keep cool. - What? What are you doing in Clermont? You serious? Chad, you arrested my mother, yesterday. Dammit. Volkov. - It didn't strike me. What an idiot. - For sure. - One of her patients called me. - Séléna Rome? The search and the arrest were rather harsh. Your mother's not easy. As for the search, I was with rookies. - Never your fault. OK. Come on, tell me. Quite heavy charges. Since yesterday, her silence is not helping her. She only asked for tea. Let me talk to her. Hey, can you bring Volkov over? Commander Garnier will be in at 9:30. You don't have much time. OK. Thanks. - You knew the victim? - Not much. I met him once in Paris, a few years ago. That's the last time I saw my mother. Remember? The double line upwards. Silly, I've got two. It's your cop friends who called you? No. It's one of your patients you're so fond of. Séléna? - She's amazing. - Her disease, too. It's attacking its own defence system. Like you, apparently, since you've been arrested. Commander Garnier understands Russian. - Insults especially. - What the hell... You're nursing? Adam. He's 6 months. That's a very pretty name, Adam. Taking me back? I just can't wait to meet him. I don't get it. Why have you come if you can't release me? You killed him? Tell me the truth. You think I'm guilty? But... Fanny, I lost my best friend. I loved him. We'd separated, but we were very close. How could you... Miss Volkov, you have no business being here. Take her to her cell. You, the Egyptian, not a word. Go back to your babysitting. Fanny, please come with me. I don't need a nosy parker interfering with my investigation. No special privileges here. Tell me what she's charged with. Why would she have killed a man she loved? Jealousy, cupidity. The usual stuff with the bourgeois. Especially those who've made it. They always want more. My mother's never been after money. Let me check her file. I can help you save time. But you're the daughter of the suspect. And I care a hang about cop solidarity. I've got an antipathic nature and a cynical philosophy. You must hate yourself on principles? I'm not the kind to waste my time trying to love myself. The contact of the public defender. I'm warning you I'll keep an eye on Captain Balhul. His wife walked out and left him with the kids. Don't take advantage of the situation. Rudeness is another of your traits. You saved his life, in Lille? He didn't dare use his arm. It wasn't your case. He might feel indebted to you but he mustn't divulge anything. Now, you leave my shop. I'll be seeing you soon. I told you I'll see you soon. You're not my type: too young. Thank you. A discharge of Mrs Gilot. I'm taking over the defence of Irène Volkov. Become a brief? Not at the CID anymore? Well, I was a criminal lawyer before joining the police. I'm currently taking the exam to be commissioner. To go back to criminal law, I enrolled at the bar. It's the first time I'm seeing this. You'll end up at internal affairs. The least blunder and I'll ruin your end of career. You're starting to sound like your mother. What charges justify her custody? They'll take you to her cell. The time of the death is not written? The body stewed for a while in the water of a spa. And there's no DNA trace either. Your mother got rid of her victim's clothes, certainly to have a fling with him before poisoning him. Nothing proves she poisoned him, let alone having poisoned all those at the party. The blood tests taken from the victims proved the arsenic used was Trisenic and came from her practice. It was easy for your mother to pour that poison in the drinks served on the park or in the sweets. The dosage for Dr Duroc was just a little stronger enough to cause a cardiac arrest. There was 0,1 mg in his blood. It's lethal. What would the motive be? Xavier Duroc had made her his only heir. It was just before they lost their child, notary says. Properties in La Bourboule worth several millions, plus the shares of the company owning the Spa. Don't hesitate if you've got more questions. Motherhood's made you reasonable? I'm not leaving the police. It's temporary. It's a pity. You don't have to do this for me. You've never worried about me for all these years. You weren't accused of murder. If you don't want me as a lawyer, say it. Searching for forgiveness? I'm not here to settle our problems. Just yours. Let me work. Then I'll go. As you like. You inherited of the fortune of Xavier Duroc. - You didn't know? - No. He never told me about it. Garnier'll want to prove the opposite. Xavier texted you at 8:05 pm. "I need to talk to you." You didn't answer. I was called to the Fenestre park. Then, you reached him at 00:48. - The conversation lasted 25 secs. - No. I didn't reach him. There was no reception. It often happens when we're on the move. The spa Wi-Fi hotspot shows he was there at that time. That's why Garnier's accusing you. But I wasn't at the spa. I called on 3 people before going home. You must give me their contact. In your opinion, who'd want to kill Xavier so badly? I can only think of the Cazal. They're hoteliers. Those 2 families are in conflict over the city management. - They knew he was sick? - Everyone did. He had a stroke during a municipal meeting. The Trisenic's no trivial choice. They want me accused owing to my research. Irène. Er... Chad, where's Adam? Sleeping in my office. What news? No. Why? I know that face. You can't say lies. Two teenagers disappeared during a hike. They were from the Children's home. And...? They left yesterday, camped by Guéry lake and disappeared in the night. The alert was sounded at 9am. We just got to know. The mountain gendarmes are on it. Anything to do with the crime? It's Damien Dutour, he was suffering from diabetes and obesity. He came around noon to get his insulin. And the other one? Rebecca Lalande, a patient of yours? No. She came with Damien. I only know she suffers from asthma and has some allergies. They could have taken the Trisenic at that moment? The waiting room gives onto the medical room where I see to my patients. You're accusing those kids? Their testimony could be essential. OK. Balhul, meet up the gendarmes and bring back those kids. Do note the prosecutor's prolonged the custody of your client. I might have more questions. I have nothing else to say. My mother didn't want me to join the police. She wanted me to change the world, not to protect it. You've come for her, though. How did it go? There'll be some kind of backlash. - Tell me, any other leads? - I can't. Amongst Duroc's patients? Or his family. No close relatives, only cousins who don't live in La Bourboule. Who's this little man's daddy? I know him? It's Baron? I always had a crush on him. I don't regret. He didn't leave his wife? What's he doing now? - In the DNPJ division. - Oh, right. You like complicated things. And you? Carmen left. The boys are with me. - Why? - I doubt I'll ever know. She's in Hong Kong, now. And... Séléna Rome, she's still at your mum's? Yes. She's waiting for me. Why? - For nothing. - Liar. Yes, my love. This is where mummy grew up. Anybody in? Séléna? Over here! I dusted it. It's big enough for Adam? I think it was my cradle. Where was it? There's a storeroom upstairs, full of stuff for children. I'll have a look afterwards. Everything's changed here. - I'm starving. - It's past 3. There's some stew left. I'll make it warm. Thanks. That's perfect. I'll change Adam. It's good you're here, especially for afterwards. I'm exaggerating but for me, she's always been like Dr Jekyll and Mrs Hyde. On the one side, an extraordinary doctor, nonconformist, passionate. And on the other... Overwhelming. The worst was her absence. She entrusted me to my grand-parents, in this house, before leaving for Ukraine. And then I only remember promises she never kept, projects of living together forever put off. I only saw her at week-ends... When she was in France. And did you know Xavier Duroc? For a consultation, the day before he died. Irène wanted me to see him to talk about my disease. A possible cure, and so on. What about the children who're missing? Something happened with them in the mist room. We can hardly see anything. The kids removed the girl's swimsuit, and her boyfriend stood up for her. It was quite violent. Can you watch over Adam? Don't worry. I've done a lot of babysitting. If he wakes up, I'll take him for a walk. Fanny! Valérie? How cruel you are! Why are you always so pretty? But you, too. - You work here? - Yes, since 2 years. Head of one of the last Children's homes. Maybe not for long. You're here for your mum? They're both here all year round. Rebecca Lalande is a hard child. She's offbeat, and has a heavy past. She's been everyone's scapegoat since she arrived. Damien Dutour is the only one with whom she gets along. A solid guy who could be scary. A bit like Of mice and men with teenagers. If they ran away, it's Rebecca's idea. You spoke about her past? What happened? Many suicide attempts. She almost died. She was followed by Dr Duroc. Before this place, she was in an institution after she tried to poison her step-father. I didn't tell the police anything. What were they doing the day of the poisoning? They volunteered to sell pancakes at the Fenestre park. A pancake, ma'am? No, thanks. The treasure hunt will start in 5 minutes, at the fountain. Right. Thanks. You've done a great job. I'll take you on any time. What about putting back? No, leave it. We must dismantle bit by bit. I'll do it. - For you. And you. - Thank you. Thank you. You can go now. You see to the counter? They were allowed to go hiking at Guéry lake the next day. Their supervisor told us they were missing this morning. I called the police immediately. - You've got a lawyer? - Yes. It's compulsory. But he's in Clermont. Can you ask him to call me? Think them running away has got to do with Dr Duroc's death? They'll let us know when we find them. It's better if somebody represents them now. We lost their trace by sector 8, the most uneven area. Thanks. Hello. Can I speak to Régis Cazal, please? You are...? Fanny Volkov. I'll call my son. He must be at the restaurant. Come. Follow me. I knew your grand-mother well. She'd come to my adoptive daughter's funeral. That was 20 years ago. You'd gone to town for high school. You surely can't remember. She was from the Philippines? We didn't see you after your mother settled in. You felt homesick? I've come to help my mother. Forgive me, I'm so silly. I heard she was suspected of Dr Duroc's death. That's probably why you're here. - Régis Cazal. You asked to see me. - Yes. Thanks for sparing some time. I wanted to know, the day of the party, did you notice anything strange with the youngsters at the pancakes? No, I don't recall. Everything was fine. Things went wrong afterwards. Why are you asking? What are you searching for? I'm defending Irène Volkov, my mother. I feel that Damien and Rebecca are the cause of the poisoning. They ran away yesterday. And... they'd have poisoned the pancakes? By the way, do you have any batter left? I'd need a sample for analysis, and the ingredients that were used. I understand better why I was sick. I called for my doctor. I couldn't move. The pancakes never came to my mind. It's my cook who prepared the mix. - Anything left? - No. All the elements went into the dishwasher. What would they have put in it? Arsenic. Well, a medicine. Oh, those wretched rascals! Those wretched rascals! We must inform commander Garnier right away. - You know him? - Yes. Well, he questioned us the day Duroc was found dead. - He took our statements. - Yes. Dr Duroc had come here the morning of his... accident. We weren't in agreement about the board meeting of the company managing the spa. Our families always had divergent interests, but I sincerely regret his death. A responsible man. I'm certain our families would have got along, eventually. I like... the valley in blue. It gives... a feeling of vertigo. You're good. It's an aquarelle Irène did. Tell her. But to answer your question, I started painting when I was under cortisone. I was totally restless. I needed something to calm me. Aquarelle did the trick. And... that treatment did you good? My doctor in Paris sent me here. Let's say it gave me back some hope. Not of healing completely but to cope with the disease. It's easier to meet someone without these marks. Not staying for a drink? No alcohol for me, thanks. I'll leave you. I'm tired. Come on. That girl's real touching. Her illness is so nasty. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. OK. They broadcast the missing notice about the kids. The spring water didn't cause the poisoning. Some clients have been affected. Régis Cazal, too. It must be in the pancakes. We must check if all those who had were sick. And get Duroc's medical dossier on Rebecca. There's surely essential information. We're not partners, remember? Really? Those children know about something. Why disappear, then? The cop has supplanted the lawyer. A cop also defends the innocent. My mother, in this case. - Hello? - It's Chad. We've got the kids. They found them thanks to a camera at a bus stop. They'd spent the night at a school friend's place. Great. Thanks. His nose is running. He must have caught a cold in the train. I've got physiological saline. Don't worry. What are you doing here? I'm temporarily in charge of the defence of the Children's Home. Consider Damien and Rebecca are my clients. Rebecca, tell us everything. You can talk. Damien, please. We heard about Dr Duroc's death during the hike at lake Guéry. We were scared we'd be accused. To find the culprit, you must tell us everything. At the Fenestre park, we saw him go and vomit by the sequoias. - But he didn't die there. - Damien didn't do anything. I went with Damien to see Dr Volkov. Damien, your turn. - Hello. - Hello. How can I help you? I took them because of the word "arsenic". I wanted to make them all sick. To take revenge for what they did in the morning. I'll have 2 with butter and sugar. Dr Duroc offered one of the pancakes to Dr Volkov, but she didn't want. So, he gulped both of them. There were just a few vials. I didn't think it would act so fast. What did you do with the vials you poured in the batter? We had a bin. How many vials were there? It's important, Rebecca. Er... 10. You sure? Yes. - Not more? - No. It takes more to cause a cardiac arrest. Thanks. Tell the juvenile court everything. - Alright? - Yeah. - Sorry? - Yes, ma'am. We should widen the right to abort until the age of majority. All this is perfect. When your mother noticed the theft, she made the connection with the poisoning. She just needed to give Dr Duroc a fatal dose, thinking this rascal would be blamed. My mother's not as cynic as you. - Hello, doctor. - Hello. The doses Irène had are registered by the pharmacy. If it tallies, it means Dr Duroc was poisoned with something else? arsenic trioxide is present in different forms. You get them in pesticides, paints, sometimes even in a natural state. - Hello? - Chad, I've got news. Interested? Ok, tell me. I don't think it's the Trisenic that killed Duroc. - He did take, but that's not it. - So...? Someone gave him arsenic in another form. I'll call the prosecutor so he orders further toxicologic analyses. - I owe you that. - OK. I hope so. Thanks. Tell your mother the results of the protocol are encouraging. Mrs Volkov? I won't move from here without my daughter. The prosecutor has ordered your release. - You're free. - Fanny's not here? She's at your place. You owe me an explanation, isn't it? The charges against you have been lifted. Dr Duroc was not poisoned with Trisenic. It might be arsenic of natural origin. Oops! A burp. Come on here. Come on here, sweetie. Why are you bothering him? He was OK, wasn't he? Why didn't you call me when you were arrested? Fanny, I'm very happy you've come, but why expect something in return? I taught you never to expect anything. Come off that. It's your way of eluding responsibilities. You always had everything you needed. You didn't come to see me when I lost my baby. You knew how miserable I was. I wrote you a letter. A few words without any feeling. Well. Stay a few days anyway. When I heard you were pregnant... I hated you, Mum. Tell me about Xavier. I only met him once. We spent all our childhood here. His parents lived here, at the time. We almost never left each other, even during our studies. But one day, something happened... And I went... to live in Kiev. You met my father? And many years later, I met Xavier again, by chance. It was at a conference on balneotherapy. In Biarritz. I was invited because, after Fukushima, I discovered in Japan the benefits of our... No medical, please. Xavier had just lost his parents. And he came to live in La Bourboule. He suggested I join him to continue my research. I accepted. All my life, I... I only thought of work, treatment, research. And suddenly, I felt like settling down; I wanted a family. I fell pregnant. Xavier dreamed of being a dad. The amniocentesis showed nothing abnormal, but the child wasn't viable. You'd have had a little sister. It's crazy. For money reasons, this town that was dedicated to cure children gradually shut its doors. Xavier regretted the closure of the Children's home. He wanted to restore the spa. The fairies left long ago. I must continue. Maybe I'm the fairy. The notary told them that very day, that I was his heir. I understand why the police suspect you. Sophie... We must continue Xavier's project. We must stop the sale of the spa. What sale? See who's there? I think it's my daughter. Fanny. There you are. She's also my lawyer. Where's Adam? With the physio. I thought he'd crush his chest. Mums hate it, but it's the only way to clear the lungs. I've got patients waiting. You'll explain about the spa? What about removing the mask first? - Can I have lunch? - Yes. Thanks. Murders within the bourgeois are always motivated by jealousy or cupidity? A big group wants to buy up the spa, right? Yes. The Chaîne thermale des volcans d'Auvergne. It's no secret. Duroc was one of the biggest shareholders. He intended selling his shares to the town. Thus depriving the Cazals from a big amount. Cazal son did confirm his intention of selling. You know, by turning the Children's house into guest houses, the Durocs pinched half the clientele of the Cazals. So, it was an opportunity for them. Cupidity, motive. That's what you said, right? The Cazal knew the Durocs were in favour of the sale. Yes. It's the lawyer, the cop or the daughter of a suspect who wants to teach me my job? All three, commander. I want the truth. Ask your mother if she's told you the truth, and get back to me. What are you insinuating? I'll save some time for both of us. Yesterday, the Cazals called me after you visited them. I sent the forensics. They scrutinized the pancake utensils and the kitchen. They didn't find anything. That's no proof. Régis Cazal himself was a victim of the poisoning. He was at home the night of the murder. His doctor confirmed and witnesses, too. He could have hired someone. Now, that's not worthy of you. I'll tell you what I think. The good feelings of late Dr Duroc and your mother are far from helping the resort. Encouraging tourism here, would help less wealthy people than your mother. Like this producer of Salers meat. I spoiled your appetite? Irène Volkov General physician Garnier's still suspecting you. I know you'll defend me. They have no other lead. The Cazals are not clear, but they have alibis. I'll fight to convince the council not to sell the spa. It would be a catastrophe. I'm dining with the mayor tonight. Coming? No. I didn't spend much time with Adam. You've resumed being a lawyer. That's good. You'll stay here and assist me in my project. It'd be good for Adam's health. It's all about you, once again. Adam just had bronchiolitis. The physio said the massages did him good. Stop it! You didn't ask anything about me. How I am, where I live, with who. I'm worse than a burden for you, I'm invisible. I don't see you where you are. It's a reproach that women say to men, not to their mother. I'm going back to Paris. I had dinner with the other patients and their husbands. They wanted to go to the casino. What's wrong? I should have never come. You got into words? I'm leaving tomorrow morning. Isn't it rushed? Give yourself some time. I can see you've made up your mind. I must prepare for my exams. Think that's what's good for your son? Fear for his mum? You know what's good for my son? If I'm commissioner, I'll be more with him. I came because you were in the shit. But I just can't get to do a thing. I'm sorry. I was tactless. I often am, I know. Stay. Not for me, but to find Xavier's murderer. I loved him. I want to know why he died. - The police will do its job. - They're all fools. An investigating judge is on the case. Right. You go to Paris, take your exams and come back. Meanwhile, I'll take care of Adam like my own son. Adam is my son, mum. My son, mum! Understand? Garnier's been killed. Not too young for a crime scene? His throat was cut in one go. - Time of the death? - Can't say. The water's about 40 degrees C. No blood in his body. We must analyse the skin. I did a biopsy. The stab was given in the bunker. There's some traces of blood. The killer stripped the victim, so there would be no DNA, and then pushed him in the basin. Just like Dr Duroc. The crime scene has been messed up, but we managed to find shoe marks. Can there be arsenic in the underground galleries? La Bourboule is the only spring where there is. That's why it's so special. Here, it's sulphur and limestone. OK. I'll leave you. What's in your mind? We don't know the origin of the arsenic that killed Duroc. The analyses mentioned sediments. - Think both deaths are connected? - Yes. Lots of youth come here for after-parties. Garnier might have caught them and it went wrong. They slit his throat to drink his blood? Vampires? We must consider all the leads. When we heard of Garnier's death, my superior asked the CID to detach you from the case. No, I'm on leave. And I'm going back. No, you're not. My boss was bumped off. We're partners again, like before. You didn't do that? You called Baron? Adam's father, right? Just a stamp and back you are. You're a pain! What news? I should be assigned the investigation. Find another lawyer. But I don't need one anymore. Remember the adoptive daughter of Simone Cazal? - Grandma had gone to her funeral. - Yes. Yamara. She was killed twenty-odd years ago. Her body was found near the Croizat spring. Murder in La Bourboule Garnier took part in the investigation. "Commander Garnier alleges Yamara Cazal, aged 20, "had been raped and then hit on the head "near the spring of Croizat. "DNA traces accuse suspect Julien Dormant, aged 32. "The man was camping with his 6-year-old daughter "who was at La Bourboule for an eczema treatment. "The victim was working as a youth supervisor." And the little one? Any photos of her? No. it's forbidden by Child protection. - Have a printer, here? - Yes. Murderer of Yamara Commits Suicide Body Found at Félix Spring We've got a problem. The Dormant file is missing. Garnier? Archives claim no one requested it. This story might be the connection with Dr Duroc's murder. At the trial, Dormant continued to claim his innocence. 2 months later, in his cell, he'd slit his throat open. The throat cut, like Garnier. That's a lot of coincidences. It is said that the testimony of the child clearing her father was held inadmissible after psychiatric analysis and lack of proof. The girl might have seen the murder. I'll ask Saint-Étienne tribunal for a copy of the trial. - Can you come, Fanny? - Coming. CID has detached you to team up with Captain Balhul. You'll start as of tomorrow. We'll get you a gun, and a car. Heard everybody? Stop pretending to work. I want to know Garnier's exact timetable. We must catch the bastard who did that. We have to. Got it? He was at the Café de Paris before the murder. We're waiting for the videos. OK. Get down to work. The minutes of the hearings. Here, what we know of Duroc's patients. This, the shareholders of the spa. OK. And so what? This was one of Garnier's habits. He couldn't manage Smartphones. Was Duroc the father of your daughter? Her father was Ukrainian. He's dead. Many testimonies assert you were pregnant when you left Clermont for Chernobyl. Whatever your explanation might be, according to the date of birth of your daughter, her father can't be Ukrainian. So I'm asking you who the father is. It's none of your business. You're wrong. But it doesn't matter. If it wasn't Xavier Duroc, he could have got to know. You were lovers then? Go out! You've lied to your daughter all along. I wonder why she's defending you. Why the hell did I come back? To know the truth about yourself. You needed it. If Xavier Duroc was my father, why hide it from me? It makes no sense. It might not be him. I hope it has nothing to do with the 2 murders. The time of the death was between 9pm and 11pm. That clears the youngsters who found the body. Jugular and carotid neatly slit. From behind. In one go, by a right-hander. I have no clues about the blade. If it can be of any help, the commander had 1,3 g alcohol in his blood. Champagne. He'd eaten oysters. No trace of arsenic. Thank you. I'd like to know something else. I need a paternity test, maybe linked to the case. There's no problem. I need 2 blood samples. Compare mine with Dr Duroc's. If the test is negative, I'd rather it stays confidential. Otherwise, it must appear in the file. OK. It's good you're continuing. It will strengthen his immune system. He still got bronchiolitis. 3 more sessions and it will be over. You didn't ask me who the father was. I was waiting for you to tell me. You're not bothered, actually. Listen. If he wants to come, he's very welcome. I don't think it's the case. And my father? - Tell me about him, please. - I told you everything. You loved him? What do you think? - You never told me the truth. - Being a cop doesn't allow you to talk to me like that. Garnier. I'll deal with those gentlemen of the Chaîne thermale. I'll get the list of Garnier's calls in the morning. Thanks. - The Dormant trial. - Good. Court of Saint-Étienne "Hélène Dormant, born on 11 December 1990. "Nervous eczema "of somatic origin. "Duroc. Garnier. "Yamara. "Hélène Dormant?" Séléna Rome, born on 11 December 1990. What's the maiden name of Hélène Dormant's mother? What are you doing here? You could ask me, before nosing in my papers. Rome. Anything else? - Adam's with Séléna? - You didn't want me. - Her real name is Hélène Dormant. - What? But, Fanny... Adam? Adam? Séléna won't do him any harm. - They're not here. - Calm down. She premeditated the murders of Duroc and Garnier. She's blaming them for her father's suicide. Adam... My love. My father was innocent. I told Duroc again when I went to see him. 20 years later, he believed me. He told me on the phone, the evening he died. The call at 9pm? He wanted to help me recall Yamara's murder. That's not what you told me. I did not kill him. So, when I suggested you go and see Xavier, you knew who he was? I didn't even know his name, but I recognised him when he opened the door. Séléna Rome? Hélène Dormant. You remember? Yes, very well. For 20 years, I refused to see a shrink. He'd stolen my word by distorting it. I was once again facing him. You didn't believe me. My father committed suicide because of you. You wanted to know if my "daddy" had quarrelled with Yamara like he quarrelled with my "mummy". You were 6, if I remember well. There'll soon be prescription for the real murderer. Well. Tell me what you remember today. I was on treatment for what they thought was eczema. My father didn't want to leave me. We camped outside. He'd pick me up from the spa. That's how he met Yamara. That evening she came with us to the spring of Croizat. I was tired. I was resting in the tent. I saw them kiss in the basin. My father told her to wait, he was going to get something from the car. We were parked 10 minutes away. I preferred to stay in the tent. Hélène? I'll be right back. Yamara's down. Let go of me! - What did you do? - Nothing! It wasn't my father's voice. I heard a violent blow and noises in the water. I waited for my father to come back. I was a bit scared. I heard steps coming from upstream. Then, I really got scared. Hélène? You OK, honey? - Where's Yamara? - I don't know. - A man came for her. - Who was it? I don't know. I didn't see him. Don't worry. It was probably a relative of hers. The next day, my father saw blood on a rock. He woke me up. That's when the police came. Séléna, why didn't you tell me all this? You didn't trust me? I recognised Garnier when he came to the practice. He's the one who'd arrested my father. I called you so that you'd come. But I realised if I spoke, I'd be suspected. Nothing proves he didn't kill her. You convinced yourself. And even committed 2 murders. I'm not a liar, let alone a murderer. After Xavier's call, you met him at the spa and poisoned him with arsenic. You knew about the poisoning. - You're torturing her. - Keep quiet, mum! I'm sorry I wasn't sick to exist for you. You've got no alibi. The night Garnier was killed, you came back at 9:30, which matches the time of the crime. Your shoes were muddy. Probably from the Croizat spring. - I'll get them analysed. - No. You slit his throat so that he dies like your father. No. I went back there before the dinner with my friends. I wanted to find some clue. Something I'd have forgotten. As from now, you're in custody. Get your things ready. You've surely got medicine to take. Yes, doctor? I sent you the results of the test by email. It's up to you to know if it should appear in my report. Fine, thank you. I need some time. You're taking it out on Séléna instead of me. Because you've always lied to me? - You're crazy? - No, I... Stop it! Car keys and phone. Irène. Give her the keys. I know how to use it. Séléna, stop it. You're condemning yourself, Séléna. I've got nothing to lose. Séléna, stop it. Stop it. Calling all units: intercept vehicle, a Volvo registered CV... 82-72. - Driver, Séléna Rome... - Shit! ...is armed and dangerous. Individual located at La Belle Époque hotel. A maniac is threatening Mrs Cazal with a gun. - Where are they? - Gone upstairs. Help! Séléna? No! I had no choice. What happened? It's my fault. She came saying she wanted to talk about Yamara. I didn't understand. When she said who she was, I asked her to leave. She pulled out her gun. What did she want? She said her father loved Yamara, that he hadn't killed her. She wanted the trial to be reviewed. I think she was suspecting my husband. Did Dr Duroc bring up the question, when he spoke to you the morning he died? No. Why would he have done so? - And commander Garnier? - No. It's she who killed them? We must check. I just heard her mother had put her up. What right does she have to question us? I'm part of the CID. You have to answer my questions. Where's Séléna? Chad stopped her from killing Simone Cazal. She's wounded but she'll be OK. You were accusing her but she was only asking for help. You still think she's innocent? Instead of condemning her, you should clear her, like you did for me. You're much closer to each other than what you think. Can you be less enigmatic? Séléna and you have lived without a father. She lost her father because no one believed her. And you didn't know him... because of lies. Your real father's not Ukrainian. It's Xavier's father. He was my mentor in cancerology, and one night, happened what should have never happened. That's why you left for Ukraine? I was so ashamed. I lied to you... to forget. It's not Séléna that I resemble, but you. Adam's father is my former boss at CID. A high-ranking officer. Married. The operation was a success. The pleura's been touched. We'll keep her on sedatives to prevent an extra painful respiratory wake-up. Will she have any sequelae? You shot? Yes. She'll have a nice scar under the clavicle. We'll let you know when she wakes up. Thanks. Séléna went to see the Cazals... because she wanted the truth. And Xavier wanted to see her because he realized he hadn't believed her when she was a child. I'm sure she found out something. That's why he died. You must find the true culprit. Promise me. Fanny? Forgive me? Can you forgive me? I can't ask for the file to be reopened 20 years after the trial, especially without proof! Tell me what you've got on that maniac. Her shoes have been taken for analysis. We'll soon get the data of her mobile and her moves. OK. I'll try to cool off Internal Affairs after you messed up. I regret having accepted your detachment. If he hears about the paternity test, forget your career. We'd better find the killer. Your mother brainwashed you? It took her 30 years to tell me the truth. So for the first time, I feel like listening to her. Clearing Séléna means clearing her father. He'd have been a victim of a judicial blunder. The murderer of Duroc and Garnier would be the same as Yamara Cazal, 20 years later. It's just a hypothesis. We'll have a 3rd murder to solve. What news about the Chaîne thermale? Garnier was to be in charge of the security of the building. They'd even spoken about his contract. A golden retirement. And Cazal? They confirmed they were interested in buying up his hotel provided the operating company of the spa accepted their acquisition offer. - That's all we have? - Yes. No. They asked Garnier to join them at the casino, but he had to go to his sister's in La Tour-d'Auvergne. The commissioner called me. Thanks for coming. I couldn't go to the morgue. May we ask you some questions about your brother? Sure. I know people disliked him. He never hid it. He was a good and generous person. Our mother was disabled. He never told me. I'm not surprised. He acted tough, but he was very modest. He blamed me for giving up my life to take care of her. But I didn't want her to go to an institution. He came to see you the evening he died? No. He was to pick up some old files. I put them aside. Yamara Cazal Case I remember this story very well. I was a chambermaid at La Belle Époque. I'd even been promoted to head chambermaid. It was just before the trial. Do you remember if your brother suspected Régis Cazal or his father for the murder? No, I don't think so. But Mr Régis and his sister were very close. Then he went to a nursing home. If I may say so. - Excuse me. - Go ahead. - Hello? - Sophie Renard speaking. He often spoke about you. There's a problem? He liked you. He called you the Pharaoh. Garnier underlined those testimonies, because he didn't believe in the alibis of the Cazals. The hotel employees? The concierge and a waiter. He knew Cazal would hit the jackpot with the sale of the spa. I always thought he was a dirty cop. I can picture him blackmailing Cazal so well. That's why he incriminated my mother? Yes. We went to Xavier's to search for instructions as regards his funeral. I fell on notebooks that Xavier completed after his sessions. It's the last one. After he saw Séléna, the word "figurine" was underlined twice. Xavier kept everything. His notes when he was an expert at the court. And there, the psychiatric analysis of Hélène Dormant. "Played with figurines so as not to see." A way of saying she'd caught her father with Yamara. Understand? What counts is this figurine. If he wrote it down 20 years later, it must be important. I'll have to keep these notebooks. - They might be exhibits. - Sure. There, I found it. A hearing statement of Julien Dormant. "Hélène loved Yamara. She played with a figurine "that she had offered her. "A Filipino figurine representing Mayari. "Yamara had told her she looked like the Moon, "with her fragile fair skin. "She longed to return to the Philippines." Got the inventory of the little girl's things? No figurine. They recorded everything. Even her hairbands. She's awake but the sedatives are still acting. But she can talk. Recovery Room Séléna? I need you to relive the day Yamara was killed. Remember that Filipino figurine she offered you? Mayari. The goddess of the moon. Like "Séléna". I remember. I remember it very well. I'd picked up a soft chewing-gum. With that I'd made a cape for Mayari. I left it there. So? The gum is intact. Can you get the DNA of the owner? It's been very well conserved. What sample must I compare it to? With the victims of the poisoning. I'll call the hospital. I examined him at La Belle Époque. But I didn't do a blood test. No food poisoning? He had symptoms, but I didn't prescribe anything. His mother had given him everything. Bicarbonate and a generic drug against arsenic. She was a chemist before marriage. Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome. Bye. So? We need a sample of Régis Cazal's DNA. I had a coffee with him at La Belle Époque. That's not all. I met an expert who had inspected the spa after the poisoning. When he came to give Sophie Renard his final report, and talking about the poisoning with arsenic trioxide, he remembered a study had been done in the resort when drilling wells had been shut down. In one of them, they'd mentioned deposits highly concentrated with arsenic trioxide in the faulty pipes. - The Cazals owned that well. - In the park of the hotel. Régis Cazal, you are taken in custody for the murders of Duroc, Garnier and Yamara Cazal. - What's this joke? - Turn around. - Where's your mother? - Upstairs, in her flat. 2nd floor. Hey! No. No! you can't do that! Letters rogatory have been issued by the judge. Move on. We found the same at Croizat spring, 20 years old... With your DNA on it. It was an accident. Yamara! Let go of me! - But what did you do? - Nothing! - You slept with him? - No. Yes! No, you're mine! Mine alone! I threw the stone she fell on in the water. Then I took her to Félix spring. I hit, again and again, to leave blood marks. Then I threw her body in the Dordogne. I was sure Dormant would be accused. Dr Duroc came over to talk to you about the figurines. To convince me to accept the trial to be reviewed before prescription. I had to protect my son. And your interests. By poisoning him, you killed 2 birds with one stone. Régis had found the vials of arsenic trioxide in a bin that had opened up. We found it in your medicine cabinet. With the arsenic you collected from your drilling well. I used it as rat poison. I mixed it with bicarbonate. When Dr Duroc came back in the evening after the party, he was complaining about the pancakes he'd eaten. His heart didn't hold out long. You got rid of him by taking him to the spa, through the galleries, discretely. Xavier? Xavier? Hello? Xavier, can you hear me? Xavier? I can't hear a thing. I'm hanging up. The arsenic was a godsend so that Garnier would suspect Irène. He understood very quickly. When did he start blackmailing you? When you released your mother. He became much greedier. How much? He knew about the Dormant girl. He raised his rates and demanded 10 % of the transaction with the Chaîne thermale. I agreed to meet him at Croizat spring and promised to pay him cash. I slit his throat with my best knife. He bled like a pig. I'll tell you a secret: the town has bought up the spa. How's your shoulder? I'm learning to paint with my left hand. I'll never forgive myself. I forced you to do it. Actually, I came to tell you... that they've accepted to review your father's trial. I just got to know. Thank you. Fanny? Have you seen Fanny? I'm here, Mum. Baby love... Mummy's going just one week. Be good with your gran, OK? Hurry, you'll miss your train. Bye. Fanny? Good luck for your exam. Subtitles: ECLAIR
