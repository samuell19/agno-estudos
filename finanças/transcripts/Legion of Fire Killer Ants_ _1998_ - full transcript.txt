(epic orchestral music) - [Narrator] As technology expands, the world shrinks. As the population explosion continues, contact among humans increases. Disease carrying viruses rapidly expand their boundaries. Killer insects are not far behind. In South America and Africa, there live ants so deadly in a matter of hours they can devour an entire elephant to the bone. This is not science fiction. This is science fact. The story you are about to see could happen tomorrow. (dramatic instrumental music) (dirt bike revving) - Oh, I'm cold Glenny. Come on, it's our honeymoon. We're supposed to spend it in bed. - I know. Just let me finish up this one roll. - No. - I just want to capture you in this fabulous light. You will be rewarded for this. - Ah, I like the sound of that. I love you. Honey, how much further? - Just up this way. Honey, look at that! That's fantastic. - What is it? - I don't know, but look at the way the afternoon sun hits the top of that. - Oh, no. No, no, no. You don't want us to climb up there. I'm not going up there. - That light will look so good in your hair. - No, sweetie, no. - Come on, come on! - Please, I don't want to go up there. - Come on, honey. It'll just take a minute. Be careful. - It's disgusting. (camera shutter clicks) - Damn! End of the roll. - Oh, great. Let's go back. - No, honey just one more roll, okay? - No! No, I want to go back. - It'll be a magazine cover. Just hold on. - [Wife] Oh, boy. (screaming) Oh, God! Help me! (Glenn yells) Help me, oh God! (screaming) Glenn! Oh my God! Help me Glenn! Help me! Hurry! - Hold on! (screaming) (sighs) - That's it, lady. Take what you want and then just throw us guys away. You know, I'm gonna put an ad in the personals for you. Young widow. Eager to mate. You won't be my first love but I'll be your last. (door creaks) Oh, hey. How are we doing for time? - You're never gonna make it, Doctor Conrad. - We will if you let me drive your car. - No. No, absolutely not. I've only had the car for a week. - Okay, look. Take good care of Hillary, I think she's pregnant. - Congratulations. Okay, here is the key to your apartment. - Oh, great. - I watered your plants. Here is your plane ticket and your bag's in my trunk. - Okay, look. If Doctor Pickerall calls, what are you gonna tell him? - He'll have your report on the rover beetle by the tenth. - Great, Bob Wright calls? - You decided not to sell the beach house after all. - And if Danielle calls? - You died in a freak lawn chair accident. - Did I suffer? - You are absolutely not gonna make the plane, Doctor Conrad. - Come on, car keys. - No! - I'm gonna miss my plane. - Thank you. - Be careful. (plane engine revving) - [Jim] Hey, Bob! How's it going? - Great! So how come you're three years late for our big fishing trip? - Hey, I'm in bugs, man. Our busy season is 12 months a year. Now tell me about this secret new spot of yours where the salmon will jump right on to our lines. - Lake Winaka, just outside Burly Pines. Nobody's there this time of year. - Sounds perfect. (helicopter whirring) You're one lucky guy, Bob, getting to do this every day. - Yeah, pretty lucky. Except for a bill from the IRS for back taxes and an ex-wife who hates my guts. - Hey, that volcano looks active. - Mount Umpachi? Nah, she just burps once in a while. - So why does anyone live up here? - There's a lot of jobs building the new dam. And it doesn't get dark until midnight. You can fish 18 hours a day. Come take a look at this. My secret fishing area is too dense to land any closer but the hike's worth it. - [Jim] Oh man, this is awesome! - Bug spray? - No thanks. Never met a bug I didn't like. - Suit yourself. - Fish will jump right on to our lines. Where are they? - I'm telling ya, two weeks ago there were so many salmon in here you could practically walk on them. - Yeah, well I think they swam for the border. - Here. Make it last. - Maybe we just need to try different flies. - Tell you what, in the morning you tie the new flies, I'm gonna go get some food. Oh man, I forgot how much I love Alaska! - Yeah, well don't wait three years to come back. Life's too short to work all the time. - Yeah. - Hold it. - What is it? - Looks like a moose. He must be asleep. - Woah, woah, you're not gonna shoot him! - Not if I don't have to. But we might need to scare him off if he decides to charge us. - Wolves? - And mountain lions and buzzards and looks like everything had a go at the big guy. - [Hunter] Hey! - That's our moose! - Then why'd you leave him for scavengers to feed on for a week? - Like hell we did. I'll be damned. (eerie music) - That's my arrow. We've been tracking him. - We wounded him like two hours ago. (helicopter whirring) (dog barking) - Murdock's dog. Hey, Blue. It should be open by now. - Good boy, good boy. (knocking) - Hey, Murdock! Something's not right. What the hell? (eerie music) - Bob. Look. - Jeez, is that blood? First a moose, now a man? What's loose up here? - Where is he? - Inside. Damnedest thing you ever saw. - Jim Conrad. - Chief of Police Croy. This is Officer Blount. - How's it going? - So what do you think, Jim? One of those flesh eating viruses? - What are you asking him for? - He's a scientist from Los Angeles. (knocking) - [Woman] Hello? Mister Murdock? - Laura? - Sheriff Croy? - I'm sorry, Laura. It's just not a good time for you to be here right now. - Why? What's going on? - Trent Murdock's dead. - What happened? - I don't know. I'm just starting to investigate right now. I don't want people wandering in here. Blount. - Sure. - [Jeff] What did you need, Laura? - Mister Murdock had some fish for me for my class to dissect tomorrow but obviously that's not important now. - I'll have somebody to bring them over later on tonight. - Oh, okay. Thank you, Chief. - You bet. - Bye, Bob. Bye. - Oh, uh, Jim Conrad. - Yeah, you look so familiar. - He writes books that nobody can understand. - James Conrad. Are you the entomologist? - Guilty. - Yes, I knew I'd seen your face. Your picture's on the back of the Unseen World. It's not very good. - Oh well, it got some pretty good reviews. - Oh no, I meant the picture. I loved the book. In fact, I bought a second copy for the school library. - Oh, well you just doubled my sales. Thanks. - Laura, I'm sorry but things are kinda hectic right now. - Absolutely. Just let me know if there's anything I can do. - You bet. - Bye. - Been a strange 24 hours. What's going on up here? - You tell me. Ain't you the scientist? - Entomologist. We know just enough to know how little we know. Like, what could reduce a man to a skeleton without removing his clothes? Or what could strip a moose clean in two hours? And what drove the salmon away? - Thanks for your interest but I think we can handle this ourselves. - Gray Wolf. - I want to see my brother. (tense music) - I don't know how to prepare you for this. - Just let me see. What did this to my brother? - I don't know, some kind of animal. - Show me the animal that tears a man's flesh to the bone and puts his clothes back on. - When we found him covered in the back room it looked like he had been trying to fight something off. Conrad, don't touch anything. The coroner won't be here 'til tomorrow. - Sorry. Gray Wolf, I'm gonna ask you not to tell anybody what you've seen here until we can figure out what happened. - I'd like to be alone with my brother. (gasps) - What is it? - Ants. - Get away from there! - [Female Officer] They're just ants. I'll get rid of them. - What are you doing? - Moving them outside. - Stand back. - What are you doing? - Disinfectant. I like 'em to suffer. - Well, you're disgusting. (Blount chuckles) - Let me know when I can come and get him. - I will. (rumbling) - Oh, dear lord. - Okay, that wasn't so bad. - They are definitely happening more often. - What? Did I miss something? - He's from LA. (chuckling) Hey, I'm gonna go check on my helicopter. - Sheriff, I'd like to run some tests. Is there any place I can stay here tonight? - I think I can come up with something. We're going to Zach Henry's cabin. He only comes up from Seattle during the hunting season. Place is stocked with food if you know how to use a can opener. - [Jim] Thanks a lot, Chief. - I brought you a new neighbor, Laura. - [Jim] Howdy, neighbor. - Hi Doctor Conrad. - Oh please, call me Jim. - Jim. - I'll pick you up first thing in the morning. - Bye Laura. - Bye Chief. - Man, I need a hot shower. - Oh, I'm sorry. There's no hot water. I just did my laundry. - That's okay, cold showers build character. I think I'm gonna like it here. (knocking) Just a second! - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. I thought you could use a hot meal. We dress for dinner. - Thanks. So how long has Croy been chief of police? - For as long as I've lived here. He's a real rarity. Smart and honest cop. Poor guy, his wife died a few months ago. - Well, looks like you're pretty good at something. - Marksmanship. My father taught me to shoot when I was 12. - [Jim] Wow. He was a hunter? - No. (chuckles) He was a New York City police captain. - So how did a big city girl like you come to live in a small town in Alaska? - She got tired of big city men. (chuckles) - Did I mention that Los Angeles is really just a collection of small towns? - What's a famous entomologist doing in Burly Pines? - Oh, I've known Bob Hazzard since college and I really needed to get out of Los Angeles for a while so I came up for the salmon fishing. - Tell me what happened to Trent Murdock. - Well, if we were in a warmer place I'd be a lot more sure of what killed Murdock but right now the only explanation I can come up with is impossible because the ground up here is too cold. - Really? There's something I'd like to show you. Come on. It's at the school. The science project we've been keeping track of the accelerated earthquake and geothermal activity in the area. But the most fascinating thing we've discovered is the underground temperature change. - Temperature change? - Yeah. Mount Umpachi has been dormant for nearly 2000 years but lately the local sulfur springs have increased in size and the earthquakes have become more frequent. - So the volcano woke up. - Yeah. - Hey, have you got a clean side? - Sure. - Thanks. - What is it for? - I want to look at something I found on Mister Murdock. Please, go on. - Well we've been using a thermo coupler in the ground and the Anchorage seismic laboratory agrees with our findings that the temperatures and the geothermal activity are steadily increasing. So the ground beneath the town is warming up. - [Laura] Exactly. It's like the tropics down there and that's probably what drove the salmon away. - I'm afraid we've got a bigger problem than missing fish. Take a look. (eerie music) (tense instrumental music) - [Jeff] Chad, breakfast is ready. - [Chad] Coming! - There you go. - Way to go, Dad! Eggs that look eatable. - Edible. (toast crunches) Yeah, I know. You want me to make some more? - Nah, I like it like this. - We're doing okay, aren't we? - Mom would be proud of us. - Yeah. Listen, how 'bout we do something fun this weekend? - Hey, let's go rock climbing again! - Alright, Saturday morning. Put the ropes and the harnesses in the four by four so we don't forget 'em, okay? - You sure you're up for it, old man? - I'll carry you home. (laughs) What are you laughing about? - In early January of 1994, scientists found that many areas of the western coastline were rising nearly 10 tens faster than normal. Can anyone tell me what this means? Patrick? - What was the question? - Chad. - The rising indicates that pressure's building underground. - That's right. A sign of an imminent earthquake. We know that bec-- - Sorry I'm late Miss Sills. I was helping my brother with a case. - I don't think you're ready to join the force just yet Scott so why don't you help Deputy Blount by following the rules? Class starts at eight o'clock sharp. - Yes Miss Sills. - [Laura] So, look on page 205-- - Chad. Look, I found the coolest thing. - What, a camera? - No, dork. I'll show it to you later. - Okay, we're used to the normal garden type ants like the kind found in your cupboard. Now they've been around for somewhere between 50 and 100 million years. But there's somewhere between 12 and 15000 different species of ants. - What's your point? - Reminds of my ex sister-in-law. Big and ugly. What is it? - That's a soldier ant. Marabunta. Every 12 to 15 years they emerge from deep within the earth's surface and they go on killing raids. They're native to South America. The queen is twice as large, can fly and she can lay up to 100,000 eggs every 20 days. Okay, these are soldier ants forming one living creature spanning an area of 10 miles long by three miles wide. That picture was taken in Brazil in 1959 when they ate every living thing in their path. - Alright, but that's Brazil. This is Alaska. - Right, but that volcano has warmed the earth below the surface, creating the perfect environment for these killers. - So you think that's what ate the moose and Murdock? - Look. They can strip an 800 pound moose in two hours. 200 pound man in 30 minutes. - What's that? - That's their ant hill. Roughly 15 feet high by 20 feet across at the base. Oh, and after a battle they carry away their dead. Now I found an ant body part in Mister Murdock's remains. I know the ants are in Burly Pines. I just can't figure out how they got here. - [Radio] Chief Croy, come in Chief. - What is it, Blount? - [Radio] I called Margie to see if she wanted a ride this morning but the operator said her phone is off the hook. - I'll check it out. (eerie music) (knocking) Margie? Margie? Margie? Conrad. - Oh my God. (kids cheering) - You know, with all this extra credit research you're gonna be on the honor roll this month. - Great, Dad'll like that. - Hey snot nose, come on. - Scott Blount, don't use words like snot nose. - Yes Miss Sills. Come on Chad. Come on. - Go on. You're not gonna have another short day 'til November. - Okay. Bye Miss Sills. - Bye. - Come on, let's go. Bye Miss Sills. I love you. I'd love to kiss you, Miss Sills. - Shut up, Scott. - Come on wimp, I'll race ya. (adventurous instrumental music) - This is all you wanted to show me? - No, dork. It's over there where I scored the camera. Come on, I'll show ya. (eerie music) Ain't that something? - [Chad] What do you think it is? - Mine, I found it. I'm gonna name it after me. Mount Blount. (laughs) First one up is king of the mountain. - Cheater! - King, king! I win. - Yeah, but you started first. - Still king. - This is too weird, Scott. We should tell my dad. - You're chicken. (mimics chicken clucking) - Such a jerk. - Where are you going? Come on. Come on, stay up here. Come on. Gosh dang it. Hey, I'm king! Ha ha! I win! You lose! Me, Mount Blount here! - Shut up, Scott. - I win, I'm king. (mimics chicken clucking) Chicken! Chi-- (screaming) Help, I'm sinking! Chad, help! - Hang on! - Help! - Hang on, Scott! Give me your hand! - Something's biting me! (screaming) - Scott! Pull up! Scott! Scott! Scott! - Help! - What's with Margie? - Is everything okay? - Nothing's okay. Margie's dead. - What are we gonna do? - I'm calling the National Guard. (rumbling) (glass shatters) - Wow. - Is everyone okay? - Yeah. (bashes phone) (groans) - It's dead. - Whew! Maid's day off? - Why aren't you at the school? - We got out early. - I gotta find Chad. - I'll go with you. - Alright, good. - He's with Scott. - Where'd they go? - I don't know. - Hazzard, I want you to fly to Anchorage and contact the National Guard. We need help. - I'm on it. - [Laura] What's going on? - Dad! - [Jeff] Chad. - (breathing heavily) Dad, Scott. He-- - What? - What happened, son? - Where's my brother? - We were in the forest, Dad, and Scott found a hill. And he climbed up. And he started sinking, Dad, and I tried to help him, Dad, I really did. I'm sorry. We gotta go help Scott. - Show me! Show me, Chad! - Come on. (tense music) - Come on. Come on! You can go faster, come on! - Chad, just stay with Laura. Good lord, the ant hill. - Scott! - Blount! - Scott! - Blount, be careful! - I'm coming Scott! I'm coming Scotty! Scott! - Blount, stay near the edge! - Scott, I'm here! Scotty! Scott, I'm up here boy! - You won't find anything here. - Where'd they go? - The colonies are massing in the tunnels preparing for another raid. - Come on, Blount. We can't do anything here. (tense instrumental music) (gun firing) - Okay, Murdock was killed first here and then Margie here and then Scott here. Okay, see the pattern? - No. - Alright, it's one systematic device we have learned about marabunta. See, the colony starts out on hit raids for food and they cover ground by alternating every 30 degrees until eventually they've covered every square inch of a circle. - If what you're saying is true then-- - Then we're next. - We've got to evacuate the town. - [Jeff] How long do you think we have? - Maybe 24 hours, probably less. Sheriff, where does your fruit come from? - I don't know, why? - Well, I know the answer here, I just can't figure out how it happened. Is there anything here that shipped from South America? - I never thought about it. - Well, what about wood, logs? What are the cabins made out of? - I think Alaskan pine mostly. - [Jim] Where did this come from? - Scott made it. It's acacia wood. Where did he get it? - I think Rocky Point beach, I think. There's some logs there that washed up from a freighter that sank about 10 years ago. - Could that freighter have come from South America? - Now that you mention it, I think it did. It was headed for Japan and headed up to the bay during a bad storm. - So soldier ants must have been in the acacia wood the freighter was carrying. - The queen could have her home in one of those old logs. We gotta try and find the queen and destroy her. See, their communication system is so sophisticated I think any direct threat to the queen would draw the other colonies out of Burly Pines. Then it's just a matter of systematically wiping them out. - Hey guys. - Where the hell have you been? Did you get help? - I have a fuel leak. I'll have it fixed so she can take off for Anchorage in an hour. - Change of plans, Bob. I need you to take me to Rocky Point beach. - Okay. - Alright, I'll supervise the evacuation from this end. I want you to keep in radio contact. - You bet. - You're gonna need someone to watch your back, Jim. Let me have your snake charmer. - You want to fight soldier ants with a flute? - It's a little more powerful than that. It's a .410 shotgun. Give me the magnesium shot. Explosives in effect. - Incinerate the little suckers. - Great, most beautiful woman I've ever met turns out to be a lethal weapon. (chuckles) - You know, you're one of the few people the whole town trusts. - Well, what do you want me to do? - I want you to lead the evacuation. The only safe route out is through Boulder Pass. Do you think you can get everybody over to the other side by four o'clock tomorrow afternoon? - Yeah, I can do it. - Alright, if Conrad hasn't signaled us that he's wiped out the ants by four o'clock we're gonna blow the pass. (sighs) - If you blow the pass that's not gonna kill the ants. - I know. I know, but at least we'll contain 'em long enough to get the military in here with chemicals or flamethrowers or whatever the hell it takes to wipe 'em out. You must have some dynamite left over from clearing the road at the dam. - [Gray Wolf] Enough. - There's one more. I want you to take Chad with ya. - Sure. - No. Dad, I want to stay with you. - Thanks. Listen son, the best way that you can help me right now is by going with Gray Wolf. - Okay. - Alright? - Yeah. (flame thrower bursts) - Homemade flame thrower. You're not just another pretty face, Conrad. Now, you've done this before, right? (flame thrower bursts) (tense music) (helicopter buzzing) - Keep your eyes peeled. These ants can smell a new food source. Us. - Yeah, well I'll wait right here, thanks. - Okay, keep this thing revved up. We may need to get off quick. - Okay. - Let's go! (eerie music) Ant eggs and larvae. - It looks like you were right. Sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. My heart will come down out of my throat any minute now. I guess there's no queen. - Maybe she floated out with the tide. She could be miles away by now. - Well, she could've left a forwarding address. - What do we do now? - Think of something else. (screaming) - What's going on? - Bob! - He's out of control! (screaming) Oh my God. Oh. (screaming) (explosion rumbles) Jim. Jim! (dramatic music) - Open the valve! - Okay, it's open. - Okay. - Light it! - I'm trying! (shotgun blasts) - [Laura] Jim, over here! (shotgun blasts) - I'm losing pressure! Pump faster! - I'm trying! (screaming) We just can't stop them, Jim! - Keep trying, Laura! (shotgun blasts) (shotgun fires) (shotgun blasts) - Jim! Jim, what is that over there? - What? - Over there! - A canoe! - There's just no way to get there! - Open up my valve. - Alright, it's open. - Come on. Alright, ready? Let's run! - Okay! - You take the bow! - Okay! - Pull it out! You got a destination in mind? - I think we'll follow the coastline down around that bluff then we'll have to hike inland about two miles. There's a river that'll take us down to Shady Lake. - [Jim] Are there any rapids on this river? - [Laura] I've never been down it. I'm sure there's some white water but nothing we can't handle. - Watch it! (screams) - [Laura] Hold on! (yells) (screams) - Hold on! Are you okay? - Man-eating ants in front of us. A waterfall below us. Define okay. - The ability to keep your head while everyone about you is losing theirs. - Then you obviously don't know the trouble you're in. - Come on! - Hazzard, this is Croy. Come in. Hazzard, come in. This is Croy. Son, what is it? - Gray Wolf wants me to tell you that Mister Perth won't leave his farm. - I coulda told you he wouldn't leave. His wife's buried out there. You want me to go get him? - Yeah, thanks. Hog tie him if you have to. Chad, why did you come back here? - Gray Wolf couldn't hold me back, Dad. You know you're gonna need me. - Alright. Hazzard, come in. This is Croy. Hazzard, come in. - Hey (mumbles). I bet you never thought you'd miss New York. (laughs) - What are you looking for? - This. - A scarab? - Yeah. It's ancient Egyptian. It symbolizes the enduring human soul. My lucky charm. - Well. Hasn't done us much good lately, huh? Our chances of getting out of this alive aren't very good, are they? - I think if we work together our odds of survival are greatly enhanced. - What are you doing here, Blount? - Sheriff's orders. You gotta come with me. - If you think I'm gonna leave because some stranger from Los Angeles says so, you're a bigger fool than I thought you were. - The ants killed Scott and Margie and Murdock. Do you want to get eaten alive? - I got a plan. - Don't make arrest you, Maynerd. - Them wholes opened up last night. Poured gasoline and turpentine in 'em. That doesn't kill the bastards I'll toss in some matches. - And blow us all to Hell? I'm calling Croy. - [Maynerd] You can't make me go! - Blout to Croy, Blout to Croy. Chief, I need your help. Sheriff, he says he's not coming. 10-4, I'll do what I can. What's that smell? - That's my prize milk cow. - [Blount] What are you doing, Maynerd? - [Maynerd] This'll take care of the little buggers! - Oh, man. (eerie music) Oh no! - What the hell Blount! (frantic music) Look! Oh my. - There's more of 'em right there! Get up the ladder! Come on! (grumbling) (yells) - [Maynerd] My back. I can't move. (moaning) (yelling) (screaming) - Maynerd! (screaming) - How much time do we have? - About two hours. Hey, hey! - It's the bait shop. - Let's check it out. Bingo! Laura, in here! - Come in Blount, this is Croy. Come in. Blount, where the hell are ya? Where the hell is anybody? Come in Blount, this is Croy. Come in. - Please God. Get me out of this. I'll never ask you for anything else in my life. I swear. - [Jeff] Blount, where the hell are ya? (yells) - What is it? - Check it out. - Oh, wow. - Tank's dry. - Let me see. Wait. Here's a canister. It's pretty dirty. Might be pretty old. - [Blount] Help! - Let me see the funnel. - Okay. (eerie music) That's all there is. Oh my God. Jim. - Ready? Run! - Hurry up! - Run! - They're coming! Turn it on! - It's on, get on! - Go! - I'm trying! - Go! Go! - I'm going! Alright. Okay, hold on! - Blount! Mister Perth! - Help! Somebody get me outta here! Somebody get me outta here! Help! Help, somebody! Somebody help! - Blount! - I'm up here, sir! Help! Help! (yells) Ah, my leg! I think I broke it. - Get up, get up, get up! - [Blount] They're after me! (engine puttering) - We couldn't find the queen. - Where's your Dad? - He's out at the farm. - Can you reach him? - The quake knocked out all the phone lines. But I can use the radio! - Great. Get in touch with him, tell him to meet us at the school. - Yeah, in the chemistry lab. - Roger. Dad, this is Chad. Do you copy? Dad, do you copy? Dad, this is an emergency. - [Jeff] What's with gasoline? - [Blount] Perth poured it down the holes to kill the ants. (groans) - Get in. Get in. (yelling) Blount, don't use your gun! The place will blow! (Blount screaming) Blount! (gun fires) (explosion thunders) (dramatic music) (explosion booms) - Hey, how's this? - Oh, that's great. - Boy, what is that smell? Sulfur? - Yeah, I'm trying to duplicate the odor of the only creature in the jungle that soldier ants avoid. Brockamina Cariosa. The stink bug. - You're kidding me. - No kidding. Strange but true. - Well how much of this do we have? - This is it. - Will it be enough? - I don't know. Come on. Great, got it. Let's go! (dramatic music) - Stay inside! They're all around the school! - I'll create a diversion! - Chad, no! Chad, behind ya! (extinguisher blowing) Go to the school bus. The school bus! - Dad, it won't open! Come on! Dad! Dad, help! - What are you doing? - I'm testing my brew. (spraying) - It's working! Wait a minute. What's going on? - They sacrificed themselves. - No! - Help! - Croy! We need your help! - What? - We need your help! - I'm kinda busy down here! - Open up your tailgate and pull forward to the flag pole! - Wait, what are you doing? - Here, just take this. We're gonna swing down. - Swing? What do you mean swing? - Trust me. - Trust you? Smart women don't trust men who say trust me. - Hey look, when the alternative is being eaten alive you can make an exception. Okay, here. - Is the rope gonna hold us both? - [Jim] In theory. - What, the theory of relativity or the one about the world being flat? - [Jeff] Come on! - Dad! - Come on! - Okay, you ready? - Ah, as I'll ever be. (screams) - Look! - Chad! - Help! Hurry! Help! - Come on! - Hurry! Help! Get me outta here! - Chad, open the door! - It's stuck! Hurry up! - Get back! Chad, be careful! - Jim! Pump it! (Chad screams) Over here! - There, right there! (pump fizzing) Right there! (Laura screams) Dad! Dad! (tires screeching) (engine revving) - There's no sign of them. They must be dead. - How much time do we have? - 12 minutes before the pass blows. Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm okay. - He's more than okay. You got a brave young man there. - I know. Where's Hazzard? - He didn't make it. - Damn, neither did Blount. - That stuff Mister Conrad sprayed on 'em, it's amazing. - How much do we have left? - Less than a quart. - I say we blow the pass now. - Not yet. - Look at that. (eerie music) (explosion rumbles in the distance) - What was that? - They blew the pass early. - Well they must've had a good reason. - What are we gonna do now? - Hey, have you got a map? - Yeah, in the back. - Okay, we found the moose here. Then Mister Murdock was killed here. And then 30 degrees. Margie. And another 30 degrees. Scott. Okay, now. Yeah, see after the earthquake we found Bob Hazzard right here and then we found Deputy Blount and Mister Perth right here. Okay, Shady Lake. That's where we found that other colony and then another one at the school. - My God. - So they changed direction after the earthquake. - Yeah, their foraging pattern shifted 180 degrees. - What are we gonna do? - What's this gray area right here? - That's the new dam. It's not on the map yet. - Let's go! - Wait a minute. You're suggesting that we go to where the ants are converging? - Yeah. - Yeah. (dramatic music) - Look. - What? There's Burly Pines, there's Boulder Pass. - No, below that, about a mile down the flood basin. - They're coming right at us. - There's only thing left to do. - What? What is that? - Blow the dam. - What? We can't do that, Jim. - That's crazy. You'll flood the entire valley. - Look, right now Burly Pines is a ghost town. Those ants are headed this way. They're gonna be in Anchorage in a month and there will be nothing left alive in their path. - There's gotta be another way. - Look out there, will ya? There's millions of 'em! Hundreds of colonies have hooked up now and they're heading this way. That flood basin is the lowest point in the valley. I'm telling you, drowning the ants is the only way to wipe 'em out. - How do we blow up the damn without explosives? - Well, I said I had a solution. I didn't say I had a plan. - You know, there might be some dynamite left in Gray Wolf's construction trailer. - Great, let's go. - Yeah, the only problem is after they built the dam they flooded the access road. So we have to go back up to Burly Pines and then come back up through the valley. It takes at least an hour. - We don't have that kind of time. - Man, there's gotta be a faster way. - Chad, be careful. - Alright, I will. - Gray Wolf's construction trailer's right down there. - Okay, I'll need to borrow one of your climbing rigs. - No, I'll go. - Jeff. - Alright. I'll give you a hand. Listen, I want you to take this in case you need it. I hope you don't. - Okay. - Thanks. - Hey, be careful. - Thanks. (dramatic music) (gun fires) Yes! Alright! (tense music) Aha! Yes! That's it. (screaming) (fast-paced dramatic music) (spraying) - Are you okay? - Can't stand to be away from me, huh? - Come on. Let's go, the ants are getting closer to the dam. I got the cable. I'll see you on top. - It'll be my pleasure. - Okay, pull me up! - Good. - What took you guys so long? - Only a few dozen ants that wanted to have us for dinner. - Come on, throw down the cable! - Dad, hurry up! The ants are coming! - Stop it, stop it! - Alright, fire it up! Get me outta here! - Okay, he's clipped. (cable grinding) Jeff, what's going on? - You guys, what are you doing? Don't stop now! (engine puttering) - Come on. - [Jim] Come on you guys! Come on you guys, pull me up! (engine stuttering) - Come on. - [Jim] What is going on? Come on, you bitch! (engine fires up) - [Chad] Way to go, Dad! - Sorry guys, guess I'm the one that got away. Thanks. - What did you find? - Six bundles of dynamite. Some fuse material, there wasn't much of it. - How long are they? - I wish they were longer. - Alright, let's go. (tires screeching) - Okay you guys, for the shockwave to have maximum effect it needs to start at the top and work its way down. Laura, careful. Set that fuse at the top. Croy, you set the one in the middle. I'm gonna go down and get me one last look at these beauties before I flush 'em back to South America. (tense music) - Dad, come on. - [Laura] Croy! - Come on, hurry! Hurry you guys, the ants are almost there! Hurry up! Come on, hurry! You guys! Hurry up Dad! (helicopter whirring) - Chad! Get on the helicopter! - Okay, it's show time. Croy, count to three before you light yours. - Got it. - Laura, go ahead and light yours. - Okay. - Let's make some noise! (dramatic music) Croy! I need your lighter! - Jim, come on! (rumbling) - It's an earthquake! - He's still down there! - Wait, what are you doing? Lower! Just jump and hold on! - Jim, come on! - Come on, Jim! (explosion booms) (explosion roars) (explosion thunders) (dramatic music) So how'd you find us? - Oh, I got a call from a Gray Wolf Murdock asking me to look for survivors. - What happens now? - Marabunta's one of nature's great mysteries. Hopefully most of them drowned but the ants that got away could go under ground for 10 years. - So where can I take you people? - Boy, I don't know. I guess we'll have to wait 'til the water in Burly Pines recedes. - That could take weeks. Months, even. - So, what are you gonna do now? - Well, we can't say for sure that the queen was drowned. I've got my theories though. I'd like to stick around and test 'em out. You know, my mom used to say that being an entomologist would be boring. - She should see you now. So is there's anyone back in Los Angeles who's waiting for you? - Nothing human. (mysterious adventure music)
