I've came out, seen birds struggling, helped them out, and that's it. I'll give them a little crack on the shell here and there. Now there's some guys who'll say, "I wouldn't do that man, they got to get out of there. They too weak if they do that." But... they give you all these rules they think are for life as far as pigeons, but people have the same problems. Babies are born early, they put them in the incubators and all this stuff all hooked up to them. Trying to say they should die, 'cause they weren't strong enough to live? No. You can help them out. They might turn out to be some of your best birds one day. If I look and I see a bird hatching in the morning, and if I come back in the evening and he hadn't got too much farther than he was in the morning, something gone wrong, and I help him out of it. I just put a little extra cracks going around, so he can break out easier. I know once he start breathing in oxygen, he got to get out that shell soon and get fed, or he'll die. So, that's why I make sure they get out. Daddy in now. He got to feed it. How many? 20. - On! Time in. - Time in! Oh, Jesse! That was sweet. I don't care what nobody else said, it was sweet in my book. I liked it like that. Oh, yeah. Basically these are rollers. These are Birmingham Rollers, that were brought to the United States by William Pensom. Pensom brought the original rollers from Birmingham, England. That's the name Birmingham Rollers. Roller pigeons are bred to perform. The average Birmingham Roller can do four to five revolutions in a split second. We're trying to get them to perform together, something like synchronized swimming. Oh, that's what I'm talking about. That's a bust. Let me see what he give. Let me have 12. - 12. - Yeah! So basically, to score you have to have a minimum of five pigeons rolling together. A lot of guys don't understand the word together. That means together. Not one starts, and then three go, and then another goes, and then you have a five. They have to roll together. - How much time is left? - Three twenty. That's a good kit right there. You want your birds to kit tight, you want them all to fly together in one unit. If you got one that want to lead the pack, then that's called an out bird. You get two birds out, then you can't score. Hey, one of your birds is out the kit! What the hell is this? My birds is definitely more impressive than this! But we live to fly one more day though. Time. - Time -Time. Time! Yeah, I got it, I, I heard it. I know. Okay, so 197.34, score. Thank you. Thank you so much. You got to sign here. - Got to sign? - Yeah. Right on, okay. Here in South Central, you score over 100 points, you're the man. Anything below 25, you aren't shit. Anything below that, that's considered a donut, or a disqualification, a DQ, you are getting talked about. Today we champions, man, we eliminate you all motherfuckers. That's what we do today, we eliminate you all. We're going to Red house, right? No, we are going to Choo Choo's. Man, don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. You see a nigga. Are you ready? You better be ready to score some points. I thought something was going on with my brother in law down here, you all should be in church, you all got the street blocked up for these pigeons. You got the street blocked up for these birds! Mr. London! When the birds work real hard, we open their breast feathers up, and it should be pink, it's purple. It's real dark. Rest them up a few days. - And then it come back pink. - It come back pink. And 20 is full turn times five. All right, so that would be a 100 raw points. Straight up. I got that with the rest of them. It was... - Mr. Jackson, are you ready? - Yeah. Thank you. Uh-oh, I got the bird God. Uh-oh. I got the bird blessing from Mr. London, aw shit. Oh, boy. No, he going to be hurt if he don't get up there. That's when he going to be hurt. Oh, that motherfucker don't want to get up, what! Come on, man, it's fly day, if you don't get your ass up and fly! - He didn't go up that way. - One of his birds coming down from up there already. - Yeah. - You got a replacement? No, I got no replacement. That's your first out bird then. So what if he get back up? Well, he's down more than 20 seconds, he's out, period. - That little bitch. - One bird down. Learn your birds. Just learn your birds. That's all you got to do. It's a lot of work. Them birds should have fought to get back in the kit, and they didn't, they started doing their own thing. I won't even use the birds like this. That out bird still out there? Yeah, he's, he's way over here now. Okay, keep an eye on him. I got him. They're not very accurate. No, they're not. I don't know what's up with today, but you know. - Hey, you missed some breaks because of that... - Got one out there. ...because him down, can't have one out up there, if you lose your... - 'cause that's two birds, so you missed some... - Alright. - ...that's why, sign here. - Okay. But that's why you missed a lot of birds. - See my point? - Alright. Where's that bird at? The dun? Ah, here. I'm a take him in here. Solitary. Put him over there. ♪ Oh darling you ♪ I believe ♪ All I need to make it ♪ Oh, darling you ♪ Oh, darling you ♪ All I need to make it ♪ Darling, darling ♪ I don't do that, I love you. Boothie. Boothie! Kids. Sleepy kids. Hey! Come on! Got to do your homework? Come on. Uh, uh. I'm trying to find the, the world cup plaque. 2007 CSRA, old cock, first place, show trophy. LA Roller Festival, West Side Roller Clubs trophy. Regional champion for Fall Fly and World Cup. Second place overall champion for the National. QSDC Summer Fly champion. Most points scored in one fly. It's more work than people think it is. Everybody think it's real easy. It's not hard, but it's a lot of work. It's not hard work, it's just a lot of it. You got to be very meticulous about everything. Last round you guys. Shoo. I would put Keith in the top five in the world. The top five in the world. In California? No, no... No if, ands, or buts about it, number one. In the United States, from the people I've met, and then seen and heard about, no doubt about it, number one. Or no lower than number two. Everything together, that's the key. You want them to roll together, fly together, eat together. Everything together. You got to make them learn that, that's their teammate. I'm demoting a bird and moving a bird up. This bird is being demoted to this kit. And I'm moving this bird right here up to the other kit, this kit right here. Well, he took off this year to kind of, just regroup, but, uh, he'll be back. I mean, he's a champion. Once you're a champion, it's pretty hard to, to knock a champion off his throne. Um, he pretty much knows what he has to do. He'll be back. I'm right here, baby. You're almost finished, man. Two, two more things and you're free, free to roam the country, my friend. It's all... It's all over with, man, it's over with. You're free, you're free. Mommy. I learned how to take care of the birds from zero. - Then I started learning different things... - Nah, Choo Choo, you... - I, I'm telling you I, I learned the things... - You probably learned that, - no, you probably learned that... - ...I learned things from Jaime. Jaime taught me that. - I didn't even know that when I was a little kid. - But you, no, but you, you... - 'Cause, listen to me, I learned from the best. - ...you was not eager to learn. You, you was hard headed when it comes to flying birds. We went to a bird show and you spent 60 dollars on a bird. - Yeah, I did. - Choo Choo, why the fuck you buy that bird? Do you... You don't even know what it go with. Like Keith London will tell you, anything you need to know about birds. The key point is, you go fuck with somebody that's competing. - Yeah. - You go fuck with somebody that on any given day, can win whatever fly they in. You should be smart enough to get up under that person to learn. Mr. London. Mr. London. Not Choo Choo! I figured the best way I'm to be good, I got to come to the best. So far the best is, you know, in this yard. I just want to be good. That way I can, you know, have something right. That way I can beat up all the club members, and people outside the club. There's a few dudes that might have a little something to say about that in the club. Well, it's up to them for them to put their work in, to make a difference. You right. I'm trying to build a whole loft full of Kobes. Kobes and LeBrons. Kobes, LeBrons, then give me a Lisa Leslie in there. Know what I'm saying? I want them like that. That's what I need though, Mr. London. - What? - That you come over here and just see what I got. Even if you need me to come get you, I'll come get you. I just want to make sure I got my shit together. You'll come get me, buy me lunch? If it need be. Got to do what I got to do to win, man. - I am not bullshitting. - Shit, winning don't come overnight though. - Huh? - All you want to do is be competitive. Yeah, I know the win is not going to come overnight. If it was like that, there'd be a whole lot of bad motherfuckers in this game, and there's not. It don't happen like that. I had people tease me, all kind of stuff, about the birds. Matter of fact, look, you see I got a trophy right here that say, "Loser." Now I need to get the other one. That's next on my list. Everybody in the yard get retrained. Put my team together. I'd love to see myself in the top ten of... ...new people flying. Just come from nowhere and do something. And to be able to do that with my own family of birds. Yeah. I'll make you some bacon. You make your own oatmeal, alright? - Daddy? - Yes? When are you going to take us school shopping? You are in charge of the shoes. I'm going to buy one shoe, then buy the other shoe. Buy one next week and then, buy one shoe... - One pair? - ...no, one shoe. Then buy another shoe, then buy another shoe. I'm a cheat then, if I'm in charge of shoes. What is it with women and shoes? This the bird right here, he's buying, these are the parents. Those are the parents to that one, those are the parents to that one and so forth. There's a pedigree to the lineage of the bird. They are going to Kentucky. Anything in there, liquid, fragile, perishable, or potentially hazardous. Fragile. These are live birds, these are very fragile. Okay, let me have them please? I used to have my own pigeon shop. I used to, called the Pigeon Connection. It was right there, that little gray looking building. I don't even know what it is now. I think it's like a... ...smoke shop or something. I think. Well, I know it was a smoke shop. But I don't know what it is now, 'cause I don't see no signs nowhere. They got it after I had to shut down, so, it is what it is. - Wassup, Choo Choo? - Good evening, Mr London. All them babies that's what you see over there, in the first one, number three. I still got a few in here. This is going to be my next team flying over here. This is where the dun came from. But I got two babies from out of there. I just took them out, they're over here. What do you think about my birds, Keith? What do I think about your birds? You have to focus on the breeding. It's all in the breeding. What's up people, it's November 17th. I got a little bored, so I decided to come out here and do a little filming. Just got a little bored. This is a real nice cock bird right here. Ms Model, nice 40-foot roller. She has one of the fastest birds in my A team right now. This is 960. I use her to put strength on, on cocks that be a little weaker in strength, without making a bird stiff. Naturally, pigeons will mate for life. They don't mate for life in our world because we control all the breedings. I'm the one who pair them up. They got to learn to love the one they're with. This is LeBronze. You know what year he was born? 2000. He's almost as old as my daughter. LeBronze babies. The object is to breed two birds together that give you everything you want in the babies. The best birds are going to produce you everything you want, or close to it, on any mate. My favorite thing about the hobby is the birds. Sorry, guys, sorry to interrupt. Excuse me, gentlemen. I want to apologize for being rude. I do want to give you the opportunity to be able to purchase anything that I have in this case here. Would you like to buy a movie or a CD? - No, thank you, man. - No, thank you? What about you, sir? You good? - Fuck you all. - Tell me. You know what? I want to ask you this question. I want to ask you this question. I should have taken a shit. I came by some bullshit. Why... why do birds roll? Why do they flip? - Why do they flip? - Yeah? They're having a seizure. Didn't I tell you that? I said something wrong with them. - No, it's not something wrong with them. - It is something wrong with them, 'cause you're not supposed to have a seizure. - That's not true. It's, it's a... - It's a gene thing... - Yeah, it's genetics. - ...it's in their blood. Didn't I say that? That's just like you're black, you don't got no choice. Like Benny, where you from Benny? - My mom is Salvadorian and my Dad is Brazilian. - So he had no choice in that. It, it have nothing to do with you, it's your parents. Only birds that carry that strong gene you can breed. Them the ones that you keep breeding too? Yeah. Those become your breeders. But what I said is, why do each bird - come out doing, rolling though? - They bred that way. - Okay, now look, now if I'm mentally retarded, right? - Yeah. All my kids are not going to be mentally retarded, you see what I'm saying? - But it's a possibility. - Right. Yeah, 'cause you carry that gene. - Right. - Yeah. Because people treat them birds like real people, man. They feed them, they clean them, everything, just like real people. I used to do it, man. Talking about it now make me want to get back into it again. - Then get back into it, man. - Yeah. Like, you know I forgot, you know, how you do something when you are younger, and you forget about it 'cause you're onto other stuff? I forgot all about that. That was a love that I had with them birds, man. I take pride in all the shit I raise. It's an extension of me. Is that everybody? You know, you got to play with them, make them think that they are not going to eat today. You ready? Let's get it. Always been fascinated by Area 51. Nobody knows what goes on there, you just know something going on. That's just how I do the birds. They know I'm doing something over here, they just don't know what I'm doing. This is Wayne, I call him Wayne. You see this side of the face is white, and then on this side of the face he got the teardrop. That Lil' Wayne. That's young money. Let's let the Navy Seals out. It's a new day, tee-da-lee. Come! Is that everybody? Oh, why you all on my neck, bitch? This bird right here, I call him Bill Clinton. This bird is my foundation cock bird. I call him Thug, because he bullied everybody in the cage. And he's also the grandson to Bill Clinton. - We've chosen the pigeons over girlfriends and wives. - Yeah, that's right. I mean, I've dated people and I let them know, this is the deal. The birds were here before you, and the birds will be here after you're gone. I go, "Hey, whatever happened to that bird?" He goes, "It's in the freezer up in the front." I go, "Oh, boy! Well you know what? He passed away like probably like six or seven years ago and I want to mount him. I don't know, I'll put him right here on the shelf by grandma. You know. If today's hope should vanish, like footprints in the shifting sand, I hope you get some inspiration from the story of the rolling man. A true lust for life was what he had, you could tell from the glow in his eyes. A pigeon fanatic indeed he was, and this not a soul denies. Infinite patience to see his plans unfold, and unswerving faith that wouldn't break. He could tell you the history of every bird, from hatching time, till now. Each strength, each fault, from beak to tail, just when the roll came in, and how. He had never found a bird he could truly say was ideal. Some were close, most were not. But his love for each was real. Once you get around the birds, you are a different person. Like you're not angry anymore. But when I'm at home, I'm just angry. But once I get around the birds... I like his temperament. He's real, he trusts me a lot. More than all of them. When I was five years old, I kept seeing my uncle go in the back, inside this little box thing, and he said, "All my pigeons are in there." And then he let them out, and I saw them fly around, and those colors, and they started flipping, I was hooked. I used to ride my bike towards to their house just to look at the pigeons all day. That's it. Hey, hey, hey, hey. How you doing? You good? Let's get your raffle tickets. Get your raffle tickets. Got a lot of feed, perches, feed trays, sprayer, magazines. - Would you like to buy raffle tickets? - Yeah, I'm going to get them later. If I get them at the end or the middle, I might win something. You know what they call you? The Kobe Bryant of the pigeon world. You didn't know that? I don't want to be Kobe, Kobe going to go out in a minute. Yeah, but that's what they used to call you back in the day, though. But he made so much money he is sitting real low. Look, look at him, he can't get up, money won't let him. I see you're going hard in the yard, huh? When you talk to him, ask him what the pedigree is. I did not go get him from there. No, but I've been thinking by the time. Poo, can I ask you this? The man is in jail, alright! You want me to ask him about a pedigree in jail? - He's in jail. - Yeah, I want you to ask him about a pedigree in jail. - Nigga, I just said it. Didn't I just say it? - That dollar a minute? - I want you to ask that nigga about a pedigree in jail. - We talking about lawyers and, - and everything else. - Oh, yeah, that's it right there, that's the one. Alright, this is the red spangle that was in the air, with the three little red-tail feathers that all you guys where ooh-ing and aah-ing about. We're going to start it off at 55, we got 75 in the front. We got 100 over here. One ten. We got a one ten. Do I got a one fifteen? We got a one fifteen. One fifteen in the corner going once? One fifteen going twice? Sold for one fifteen. Make sure you guys are keeping your eyes on the sky. The birds that's in the air will be auctioned off. They will be auctioned off. All these birds are bred by Mr. Keith London. Shoo, shoo. Come on, Blue, shoo. Ah, damn! - I haven't seen that over there yet. - Yeah, Me neither. No, no, you know what? No, no, my birds are putting them birds to shame up there. Anybody can come and see it right now, I could throw them up now. My bird breaking with every turn. Don't have us waste our gas with this bullshit, man. My level's was always going to be up here, because of that. You just run your mouth. See you talking, I done already did this, I done scored more points in one fly than you ever going to score in your life. If you wanted to stop, do you think you could stop? Doing birds? No, I wouldn't want to stop. Stop for what? What would be the reason? Just if you had to. If I had to, yeah, I could. I would, if there was a reason for it. Nah, for a day or two. And then the next day you're right back. Nah, if I had to I would, but I don't have to. I've been back there a lot sometimes, a lot, but that's the reason why I'm a champion, and everybody else isn't. That's why people call me for advice, - and not everybody else. - Who says you're a champion? A champion? Everybody. I know, but why does it always have to be about competing, to where you have to stay back there forever - and do the birds, all day? - Because, come on, - you, you don't have to. - And then come get out of the cage and get on the phone, "Hey, you man, what... ...you see the blue cock hen off of Jerry Higgins... ...and all that?" - Obsession. - You got to be obsessed or passionate about something or you're never going to be good at nothing. Passionate about something and being obsessed about something - is two different things. - What is obsession? You just said, you can't stop. You won't stop. I didn't say I can't stop, I said, I won't stop until I have a reason to stop. - But you won't stop. - I don't have a reason to stop. - Okay, what if we want you to stop? - Just like a crackhead. - A crackhead is dying. - No, I meant... A crackhead kill themselves, steal from his people to go get crack. They, they say, "I can stop when I want to." Yes, you just said the same thing, "I can stop when I want to." If... I said If I had to. - You said... - Had, I said had, I didn't say want. I don't want to, it's not that I don't have to. I don't want to. 'Cause if you do that, if you stop this, then you got to do something else. I am going through a divorce. And the cold thing about it is, I'm not, I'm not even sure if we'll even get a divorce. We could be together now, but the reason why we're not, honestly, she wants me to stop being me and be somebody else. And I can't do that. Welcome, Mr London, welcome! Still warm in here. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, oh, hello, hello. Wait a minute. Pensom made a statement, it's in his book. It says, it take the average flyer 30 years to figure out his family. And he isn't lying, it take about that much time. Say he breed you two sons? One in the air is like phenomenal, the best bird you ever seen, even better than his daddy. You got the other one, who's just marginal. But the one that's okay got all the physical attributes you want to see, everything, and you breed them. Guess which one more probably going to out produce the other one? The marginal one is probably going to out produce the one that was the best one. - Probably because... - Why, because cocks carry more than one gene. - 'Cause you got to understand... - So, how... how do you make your family go in that direction? - Because like me... - It take time. It's, it's one step at a time. You can't just boom, and the next day or next year, you right there. No, it's a gradual process. Real roller talk, truth be told. Signing off, we see you all next week, same time, same place. Peace! Let's see, hopefully this works. What are you doing? Trying to find it? Yeah, I'm trying to find... Man, we talked all that time and we get nothing? Aw, that'd be jacked up, now we going to have to, oh, man. Well, all I can say Keith, if it's not on here, damn, damn, damn! We just got to come back and do it again. Sometime I come over here in the morning time and the hawk's sitting on top of here, or sitting on top of this cage, or... The neighbors are like, "Yeah, you got a bird out, "there's a big old bird you got out," it's the hawk. Or sometime I come, he's sitting on the wire cage right here, or he's back here yanking on the cage, just trying to get him a bird, take home with him. I shut down about, like, three months ago, 'cause I had lost a whole kit. So I was like, no, it don't make no sense to keep trying to fly them out, and the hawk keep coming. They want to fly everywhere, but they locked in here. It's like they prisoners. This is Miracle's daughter. She's kind of afraid because she got chased by the hawk the other day. So, I'm like, when they don't come out, when they don't want to fly, don't force them to fly, from the hawk. What you do is you just keep them in for a few days, let them forget about being chased, then they go back to normal again. It's like you watching a scary movie, and you don't want to go sleep in your room by yourself for a couple of days, so it's like the same, you know. Back in the '60s, there were no hawks. Not prevalent as they were then. Birds used to fly, back then there was tumblers, and then, I didn't have to worry about no hawks. But now, I've lost too many birds to hawks. If I had had these kind of conditions when I first started raising, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be raising birds anymore. That's just me. But now, I've had so much time in these birds and, um, that, you know, it's just been part of my life for so long that, I'm, I'm never going to quit. The other birds are supposed to be able to breed and flourish. They're here killing and eating, they should be gone. A migratory bird that don't migrate? It's not because... It's because of them, the government, they're the ones that place them here. Raise them in captivity and place them where they want them to be. They see him. It could be right there. Oh, yeah. You all hiding out, I thought something was wrong. What you all doing? Falcon came through and got a bird, and it pushed the kit off that way. That's not good. This is the US Fish and Wildlife service, it's September 21st 2006. This is the home of Keith London. It's a hawk trap in his backyard. Currently, the trap is sprung, and it appears to have a hawk in the upper part of it. It's really flapping around. I wonder if he just caught it within the last hour or two. Crap, where is it? Come on. Shit, he just beat it I think. You can see there's a pellet gun, he's got it in his hand. - He shot it, didn't he? - Yeah, he shot it. I didn't see him though, - because I couldn't... - He's pumping right now. I can see him pumping it. - Right there. - There he goes. He shot it. Crap, I can't hold my camera still. - He just shot it, did you hear it? - I heard it. I can't see, I heard the shot. - Unbelievable. - He's pumping it again. He's going to hit it again. Hey. Um, maybe some milk or something? Yeah! Um, you're going back to the house? Okay! Okay! I'll call you in a little bit, okay? - Got it? - Yep, he's opening it. I still don't have a face shot, though. It's okay. It's now 10:47 a.m. That is a shed on the top of Keith London's, or on top of a shed in the backyard of Keith London's house. Oh, you got to be kidding me here. Black, there it goes, that's the hawk, right on top. Beautiful. Alright, it's now 11:13 a.m., that's the home of Keith London. Good evening once again, I'm Colleen Williams. And I'm Chuck Henry, in for Paul Moyer. This evening, they are federally protected, hawks and falcons, and dozens of them have been killed, and now several southern California residents have been charged with beating and shooting these protected birds. Channel 4's Doug Kriegel is live for us in South Los Angeles with more on this, Doug? Well, Chuck, in parts of LA and Riverside, there's been an epidemic of killing birds of prey by pigeon club owners, according to federal game officials. Now, seven pigeon club owners, like this one on Western Avenue, have been arrested and charged with killing these protected hawks and falcons. One of the seven arrested pigeon club owners who lives here, claims his birds are being attacked by hawks and falcons, and he's just protecting his flock of rolling pigeons. You consider your pet a part of your family, and you have the right to protect your family. And that's how I see my birds, as part of my family. But you can't protect them against the hawk. You swear, I... I just robbed a bank or something. Hm, Nalanni, the little baby, my little daughter, she was... she was in a stroller, that's how little she was. And they came back here with guns aimed, and she's right there. I'm like, really? I got caught for killing a hawk, not killing a person or robbing a bank. We had an air rifle, not a 12 gauge, not a... But we went to court, and the stipulation of our release and all that, we had to sign a little bond thing. Get out, go to court, pay your 6000 dollars, be good while you're on probation, and that's it. Nothing else. A lot of the money I used to pay the fine was really for my shop. So I was like, I... I got to pretty much start all over and I just said, "Forget it, just let it stop." What the heck? What the heck was that? Do you see the car that you're driving? What? That's my choice, buddy. - Please believe it. - What? I said, look at the car you driving! - A minibike. - Well, that's a bike. - With a motor in it. - There's no motor on that bike. - So fast, you don't know. - Bet. Eighty miles per hour wagon. Man, Keith had every car that we ever wanted when we were young. A buggy, a chevy electro? Whatever, whatever we wanted, he had it. - What kind of, what kind of car? - Astro Vans, El Caminos, Caprices. I do gym coverage about three times a week. A few people lobbied for me, you know, staff, staff from other parks. So, I got in as... a part time. It's still just part time though. They say I can't, I can't be hired full time because of my background. I was a street pharmacist for a while. You know that stuff they go. Ah, you know, hey! Yeah, I used to get out there, do my stuff. Had my times out there. That time's when everybody was on drugs. My brother, my mother, everybody was on drugs. When I was like 24, that's when I started selling drugs. I just got fed up and said, "Man, see all these people on drugs, I'm going to start..." And I just got into it. Went to jail once for it. But, one day I said to myself, "It's time to stop." And I stopped, just like that. Cold turkey. Left a whole lot of money out there, that I wish I had right now. But, that was that. And guess what my refuge was? Pigeons. For as long as I have the pigeons, I'm alright. My commercial right now? If you're having problems with any birds going light, with no appetite, getting sick, disease, salmonella, paramyxo, miracle plus. The plus stands for, also does fertility. If a cock bird is not hitting, or a female's not laying hard eggs, bam, right here. Miracle plus tabs. Guess where you get them from? Keith London. Mr. London, what's going on with the fertility pills? It's not like the other ones, is it? Where you give it to your bird, and they die once you stop giving it to them? Those weren't for pigeons though. Those not... Those were for like roosters and stuff like that. So the pills you got, what they do? Look, this is what they do, they, uh, they, they work for fertility in the cocks and hens. They cure E. Coli, salmonella, and coccidiosis. And they help with the symptoms of paratyphoid, well not paratyph, paramyxo. So you give these pills to the hens and the cocks? Hens and cocks, while they breeding. Okay. Let me see the pills, you made them, you made them? Of course. I'm a mad scientist. Oh, shit. For 100 it's 40. And if you cut it in half, it goes to 25. And, if you want to go less than that, then it goes up every single time. Count your money now, Mr. London. I don't want to owe no money, man. I don't need nobody knocking on my door. ♪ Jumped in the cab Here I am for the first time ♪ ♪ To my right And I see the Hollywood sign ♪ ♪ This is all so crazy Everybody seems so famous ♪ ♪ My tummy's turning and I'm feeling kind of homesick ♪ ♪ Too much pressure And I'm nervous ♪ ♪ That's when the taxi man Turned on the radio ♪ ♪ And a Jay-Z song was on ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah - Let me see your arms! - No! Let me see the muscle. Make a muscle. Muscle. Come here. It's not waterproof. People wash it and then it's not waterproof. Everybody's going to be in the same position when they fly, every time. The only time it gets messed up is when somebody gets sick, or somebody might roll a little low, hit the wire, - or a roof, or something like that. - I've noticed that. You know it, it is really amazing, the way, you know, they, they interact with one another, and the way they do the same things and they fly different. And just like you just said, if one is sick or something's wrong, it's lower... - Yeah. - ...or, yeah and... And it's not really keeping up with the rest of them. That's exactly, she act like she raised birds. Because that's exactly what happens. - Yes, I... - And that throws everybody else off. ...because I love watching them. You know, I love watching them - fly and everything. - Yeah. And then especially when they be way, way up in the air and then they just, they flap they wings, and then they just cruise, it is beautiful, I love it, yeah. - So, good morning class. - Good morning. Okay, so how did everybody's job searches go yesterday? - I had a job interview at Walmart. - Okay, - what position was it for? - Cashier. But according to her, when you apply for cashier, you have to do everything from cleaning toilets, to maybe possibly unloading a truck. So, that's just, yeah, you have to be able to do everything. - And how did you feel about that? - I was okay with it. And how did you respond in the interview when she mentioned that she would let you know by the end of the week? I knew it wasn't a no. So, a maybe's better than a no. Thank you, anybody else? I went to the lake shore for the warehouse, warehousing and everything, and, uh, I got to be honest with you, it was like a zoo there. And I couldn't hear, the person was sitting right in front of me like this, and I couldn't' even hear them. That was the first interview. So whoever qualified, they're going to check our backgrounds, or, you know, of course, and everything like that. Whoever qualifies they're going to call us back, you know. So... Anybody else? Okay, so let's go into the job searches. For this job fair on April 13th in Carson, it's the sixth annual career fair... I wouldn't mind being a big basketball coach for somebody, or... ...I want to do something in the creative writing field. Creative, I... I got to be creative, I got to be doing something. Or I could be a professional pigeon flyer. Ah, that's funny. Because I used to think that when I was a kid. I actually am a professional pigeon raiser. Shoo! Get your ass out of there punk. I'm trying to get your son a bird so he can fly in our club. Because I know he like the birds like that. - The South Central Rollers? - Yeah, he... - Who all in there? - We've been on there. We got like 17 members right now. I'll come. How many birds are you flying in your kit? Ah, hold on, let me check. - He said let me check. - You supposed to know. You got it wrote down? Three, I got four pairs. - And they're all sitting on eggs. - Okay. I think I got like, seven or eight eggs and one baby. Oh, man. Ah, damn, Choo. - Huh? - Right there, dropped down hard. Oh, yeah, it happens, it happens. - Walk it off. - Days off. Walk it off. You might get a chance to take that bird home with you, man. It's got my fingerprint on there man. Take him home with you, dog. Set this bird up and feed it up good, man, so you can breed from it. It roll good. All right, man! All right. Hello! I'm at home. Alright, we got to go get Paris. - Ready to roll, kid? - Yes! What kind of candy you eating? A Jolly Rancher. Hmm. It's loud and I can smell it. Who did your makeup? - Makeup? - Somebody at my school. That's a little too short. Let's see what you got. Can you take this off, please? - Too sweat. - Why? - 'Cause you look funny. - Okay. You can leave it on. Oh! You got a little, something right there. Don't let Paris tell you to take your... I didn't tell her, I said, can she. Don't let Paris talk you into taking it off? You know you wanted to keep it on, you had it on all day. Oh, no, Paris. Nice hairline. Call me, 'cause I got to come get my car from your mama, just 'cause she don't call me. It's all good though. She's the one that's going to miss out. See you all later. I'm not going to lie, I would love to see them fly on television. These people that's getting these outrageous scores, let's see how they doing. I just want to see some of these people in England, man, I want to see why we can't beat them. It isn't the dudes in England that's really doing it. It's the dudes in, uh, Holland. - So, that's, that's where it's at? - South Africa. - You going to fly for the world cup this year? - Yeah, most likely. I want to be ready before then. If I get one fly this year coming up, and I could score 500 points, nobody is going to want to talk to me, Keith. I'm not going to stop until I win. I got to win. When you win, you aren't going to stop. You definitely aren't going to stop when you win. That's what I'm talking about. That's more incentive to win. Man, you don't eat these. Stop trying to peck this out of my hand. These birds are picky. She don't, she don't eat the white ones but I can put the brown ones in there, and she'll eat them. Bird's picky. Crazy. These are the birds I'm training right now. I'm going to try to get these birds ready for the world cup. Shoo! Shoo! The world cup is not your average fly. You're competing against people around the world, from your backyard. When you win the world cup, you have bragging rights. Your stock goes up, so to speak. The world cup is a big event in the bird world. You flying against all the top notch fliers, and it's not an easy task. Your elements have to be right. If you get a real good day, anybody could win this. It's purely luck. It only take one fly. You get one good fly in, and you can be good for the whole year. For competition, birds have to fly for 20 minutes. If they land before 15 minutes, you're disqualified, it's called a DQ. Huh! Each kit I try to spend 30 minutes a day with them, at least, a minimum. Flying... if they fly over their time then I let them fly as long as they want to. These are my little standby birds, you know what I'm saying. Like if I get hit by a hawk or something, I can take one of these birds I've been flying, I fly them more. Everyday I fly them 30, 40 minutes, a hour, and I can add them to my team if I run out of birds, or I get hit, to keep my team up. I've been practicing since last season to get to this point. So I got to get... get it together. Look, this is the big secret. The secret to this whole thing is selection. That's the real key. You have to select which family to work with. You have to select which birds to pair together. Select which birds are going to come in from the kit, which ones you going to take out the kit. Selection, everything is selection. Trying to figure out which one of them birds be coming up. Trying to figure which one it is. Man, I can't tell which one it is yet, dang. That one. I'm taking that one out. - I just think Saturday going to be a good day though, 'cause... - I hope you do good. - I do too. - But my thing is, when you, when you fly for a fly like that, you want to really be ready. You know it's a put together team, but... Choo got it together though, he isn't nervous. He's just butt blowing and bullshiting, man. - Is that what it is? - I'm nervous. A lot of people are coming, - and you don't want to look bad. - Don't stop man. You don't want to look bad. - One thing you can't do man... - I don't care what you do, you don't never want to look bad. ...one thing you can't do with these birds, man, is, is, is... - Predict what they going to do. - ...no, sir! Once they come out, it's all on their own. I think that's all, all of us need, it's just luck in this game. Just got to get that right. I need some real luck. - Huh? - I need some of that lottery luck. We all ask for that luck, man. Oh, I hope you do good. - I do too. - I hope you do good, dog. We're going to let the fog die out a little bit. But if it's a scheduled fly, it should be flown, you know. But he's quite under some pressure, I understand. Eddie, Eddie, you're complaining. I'm not going to put them in the fucking fog. You want to go fucking fly, right now? We'll go fucking fly you right now. - No, I can't have everybody going. - Well then, why you complaining? I'd put them up if it was my schedule, Chris. Eddie, they're not going to make nobody fucking fly in the fog. The birds are not going to lift, you know better than that. Plus, you still owe 10 dollars. They got to understand, Sal, we can't control weather, we can't control traffic. I'm not going to make this guy push his birds up in the fog. Look, they weren't even trying to lift. - What's up with it, Red? - Hello. What's up, man? - Nothing new. - You ready? Keith London's coming right now. - Who coming? - Keith London. - Ah, man! - I wonder how everybody else did today? I just flew right now, the falcon got me one. - Yeah? - He got me the other day. Damn! - You got them ready? - I hope so, man. I hope so. - Whenever you're ready, Choo Choo. - Alright. Okay. These trailers, they got nice wing beat. They flying way better than last time, way better. Time in. - Oh, one down on the pole. - Look at that one. - One went down? - It's on the pole. Oh, yeah, I see him right there, yup. - You got to get him up though. - If you're going to scare them. You got to get him up 'cause, the World Cup, they can DQ you for that. His bird's staying down a little bit now. They usually climb way quick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're a little low, huh? That's real bad. You see how one bird can distract the whole kit? Just one, it only takes one. Man. - You see them over there? - They got their landing gear on. Yeah, I don't think they going to make the time. The birds are down. It's over. They didn't make the time. Everything they did today was out of character. Everything, the way they flew, the way they kit, the way they rolled, all that shit. Unacceptable. I don't even know if I want to go to work right now, that's just how I feel. I might take the day off, that's the way I feel. Can't have those flying, have them suckers all flying fast and weird. - You got them ready? - Yeah! Yeah, take your time. They should be out front now. There they go! Oh! There they go! Dang, look at that little check. Oh, that was nice. This is a nice kit here. That's some rollers right there. - Keith, how many you got up there Keith? - Nineteen! Now, that's a break. There we go. Give me a count on them. Uh-oh, Houston, we have a problem. Oh, they just split up right now. Something's got them spooked up there. Yeah, there's something up there. - Yeah, there he is, right there! - Falcon! Right there! Falcon broke up the kit. And they was rolling good too. There he go, right there. See, I knew he was coming back up in there. There he go, he's trying to get something. Time. Sorry about that. You have some nice birds. What's the score, Keith? He got one break. Thirteen five. Thirteen five. There's always next year man. He got too close to your head? Chin up, son, chin up. Chin up. Lock down time. Shoo! So what happened with your fly? What do you think went wrong? - You think it was the heat? - I think it's the heat and me. Honestly. - They didn't do no rolling. - They kitted? They kitted, but they didn't roll. Man, I don't know what the problem was. I got to figure it out, Keith.
