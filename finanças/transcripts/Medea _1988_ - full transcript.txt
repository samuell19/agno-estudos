This film is based on a script by Carl T. Dreyer and Preben Thomsen after Euripides' drama MEDEA. Carl T. Dreyer never realized his script. This is not an attemt to make a "Dreyer film", but with due reverence for the material - - a personal interpretation and homage to the master. Lars von Trier Medea! What seeks Aigeus in these inhospitable wastes? I am bound for the oracle. But tell me about you and Jason! Promise me that I may always seek refuge in your country! You know you may. How serious you look! You know you may, Medea! Jason built his vessel Argo and sailed to Colchis to fetch the Golden Fleece which he won with the help of Medea the beautiful and wise who gave him her love. Her love has now turned to hatred Jason betrays Medea and the two sons she has borne him Together they fled from Colchis and after a perilous journey landed in Corinth as outlaws Medea left her distant country Jason left her here. The king! Long have we waited. I am coming. We will go on ahead. Come when you are ready. Our city has prospered. Our ships have brought us riches - from distant ports. We have won respect and admiration. The gods have shown us favour - - and you have shown us the way. I thank you for agreeing to transfer the burdens of state - - to this young man. It would be wise now to give him even more authority. Even more responsibility. I am convinced he will meet the demands placed upon him. I believe the gods have annointed him and sent him to us. To perform great deeds. Jason! What have you to say? Thank you, Creon, and allo f you for the trust you show in me. It is not good for one man to rule alone. Neither it is good when the masses assume power. The state is a ship. Creon her captain, - - you, her trusty crew. I shall do my utmost to be a good helmsman. I know my responsibility to you and every citizen, rich or poor. I will teach your people to live in peace - - even if the price is death with dignity. To prove my faith in Jason I shall bind his fate to mine - - and to our country, by giving him my daughter in marriage. Jason and Glauce shall be your future king and queen. Tonight the wedding contract shall be sealed. Hear me, Medea! King Creon has summoned the elders to his palace. They speak of Jason and Creon's daughter. Answer me, Medea - or laugh! Jason is worth no more. You had many words for the elders, and yet now none for me! - Glauce ... - It is only my name. Your name means "nymph". What is your promise to this nymph? To treat her as a woman. The woman I love. Your queen? Glauce! How soft your lips! How warm your mouth! My beloved! What of Medea? She is still here... Does it matter? Medea and Glauce cannot both remain here. Are you afraid of her? No, I fear not Medea, though they say she's dangerous. Then let her be. You are the one I love. Give me proof that Glauce is the one you love. No, Jason. Not until my father exiles Medea tomorrow. I too shall see her tomorrow. Tonight you must sleep in there. Would I were dead! Death would bring peace. My life is as empty as this bed - - that we used to share when I was still of use to him. He was my all. Why must women bear so much? Wordlessly submissive in body and deed? What rights have women? A man may seek new friends. She has nobody but him. He claims she enjoys security while he lives on the battlefield. - You'd rather be a man? - Yes ... I'd rather bleed behind a shield than bearing a man's children. You are a stranger here, like me, but you have me. I no longer have the man I helped. I was but his prey. I long to return to my native land! I long for my mother, my sisters, everyone. I long for revenge. Creon is on his way. Medea... ... You must leave the country. I banish you and your children. I shall not return to the palace until the city gates close behind you. Are you afraid of me, King Creon? Yes. Why? You are wise. You know the evil arts. You can harm people. Whom? My daughter. Me. Jason. I will have to take the necessary steps. I am too weak to oppose you, and neither have you wronged me. Whom to give your daughter to is your decision. Let me remain here! I shall cause no trouble - - if you let me remain in my house. No, Medea. You must leave at once. Why? My daughter takes precedence over you. And my children? You love yours - and I, mine. There is no greater sorrow than love. Leave of your own accord, or my men will send you across the border. All I ask is one single day, King Creon. For the sake of my children. I grant you that one day. But if you are still here tomorrow, your life is forfeit. You have your day. Use it! Yes, use it... And hope for good fortune. Good fortune! Yes! Shall I let him in? I married her for your sake. For my sake? To secure your future. And the children's. Your pride is your misfortune, Medea. And your pride, Jason ... ... is your good fortune. My weakness and blindness led me to encourage your vanity. You want it to look as if I have left you. You are betraying your own children! I have thought about it. But it is too late. Have you really thought about your children? Women are not the only ones to think about their children. If only man could have children without the agency of women! You do not deny yourself, King Jason ... You have forgotten much that I remember. You yearn for your young wife's embrace. Enjoy your good fortune! I wish you a marriage you will remember! Tell Medea we are passing by. Tell her we sail tomorrow! What did you ask the oracle? A demon made us childless. - What was the oracle's reply? - Who understands such words? - Perhaps I'd understand. - That's why I rode by today. The vagueness of the oracle requires the wisdom of Medea. What was the oracle's reply? "Keep the wine in the bag until you get home". We're coming! The boys were chased out of town. What's the matter, Medea? My children and I are being sent into exile. Why? Jason has cast me off. For another woman? He has married Creon's daughter. He has broken his oath to you? His only ambition was to be the king's son-in-law. Can Jason really be so hungry for power and yet so cowardly? Yes I know a cure for childlessness. If I may sail with you tomorrow, I promise you children. My house is always open to you. You have my word. We sail at high water. No man will accept childlessness. Clauce will bear no children. - What are you going to do? - Fetch Jason! No, wait ... - What is your plan? - I trust you; you are a woman. - Make no more enemies! - I will have no more enemies. Don't torture yourself! Think of your future! I know my future. Think of your children! They are the ones I am thinking of. What do you want? Forgive my words spoken in bitterness. I see now that it was I who was hard and relentless. So you have seen sense ... Yes. I have changed my mind. Why not be friends? Did we not live together in love and understanding? By marrying Glauce you gain sufficient power and wealth - - to secure the future of our children and I. - It is only wisdom. - So is your change of heart. How stupid of me not to have helped you realize your plan! But we women can be stupid, sometimes. Do you remember, Jason? That question is always on your lips. Now for the last time. Do you remember, Jason? Whore! I know you, Jason! You have sold yourself to her. Your body was enough for her! When I see myself, I understand you, Jason. I will leave. But what of our sons? Can't they stay with you? Can't you persuade Creon? I will try. But I don't think it will work. Let them stay with you! It will be easier for me if I know you have them. - I will try, but ... - Get Glauce to ask her father. Yes, I can persuade her. It will work if you do as I say. Do what? Let our sons bear this gift to her. Go with them. Yes, I will. What is the gift? Your bridal crown, Medea! - Mother, she kissed us! - Me, too. - Please let's stay! We'll stay with you, Mother. Won't we? With your father. - And the gift? - She liked it. Good. What are you going to do, Medea? I am thinking of the children ... and myself. How? I had hoped they would sprinkle dust on me when I was dead. Then take them with you. By their death I can strike their father. Where is Medea? - Not here. - And the boys? Not here. She took them. Glauce has been poisined. The king went to help her, and he, too, was scratched. Medea killed them. Mummy ... Mummy, why are we here? Quiet, now ... Jason ... Jason! Jason, where are you? Will you not follow your queen to the grave? Help us! I know what is to happen. Where is she? What are you hanging on the tree? Something I love. Stop it! Mummy ... Help me, Mother. A human life is a journey into the darkness/ where only a god can find the way for what no man dares believe, God can bring about.
