[Sam] How much was the drone? -Millie here was 800 bucks. But I still owe 500 dollars. -Millie? -Millennium Falcon. -You're kidding. -I'm not. -Dude, you can make 500 bucks at the speech competition at school. -Huh, I'm a video blogger. I don't do live speeches to impress small crowds. -You don't do speeches to impress any crowds. -Look, all right, this next one's gotta go viral, okay? -[Sam] Okay. -So I need somebody do a belly flop off the cliff, and I nee David, how about you? -Dude, I'm already starting to get a headache.

Does that mean you guys can talk now? -Well, he's legally old enough to reach out to me, if he wants to. -Would he know how? -Shawn, I haven't updated my records since he was a baby. Then I moved, married you. -You wanna talk to him? -I don't think he'd want to talk to me. Probably hates me for what I did. -Well, there's only one way to find out. [school bell rings] -Dude, I swear I was gonna be there. But my sister got in this epic fight with her boyfriend, I had to film it from the window.

And I think you can speak on a theme that we've been given. -What's that? -The value of family. -You mean, because I'm adopted. -And that's an important perspective, right? So far, no one's focusing on that. -Yeah, but I mean, not a lot of people know that I'm -I, I know. I just believe that you could do a great job, okay?

You just won a big match and you're feeling great David? -[Susan] Oh, my God! -[Jimmy] David! -[Susan] David? [Nate] David! Help! Somebody [thumping heartbeats] [Doctor] So, do you have any medical conditions in your family history? -Well, David is adopted. -I see. -And we don't have much medical information about them. -I understand. Well, what we're dealing with here is excessive pressure on the brain. It's called Chiari malformation, where part of the skull pushes on the brain and forces the tissue into the spinal canal. It's congenital. It develops as you grow. That's why your headaches have been getting worse. Really, what you need to know is, it won't go away unless we open it up and relieve the pressure. -Open it up? -Um How much, how much time do we have to make a decision? -I don't think we need to wait any longer. We have everything ready for surgery tomorrow morning. -Um What, what are the risks? -If I were you, I'd do it before it gets any worse. -David, you okay with surgery? -I can't take these headaches anymore. -If all goes well, and I believe it will, then you won't have to. Well, I'll let my team know then. All right. -Thank you. Hey, this is all going to work out. God knew this was going to happen. -I know. But like, why is He letting this happen to me? I mean, Dad, my team is counting on me to compete in the finals, and what about college? [Susan] Honey, I'm so sorry. If I could, I would make it all go away. -I just don't understand. -You know what? I was angry with God for a long time after John and Michael died. But, if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have had you. And I cannot imagine my life without you in it. -David, you're strong, and you're gonna be fine, with or without wrestling. [birds tweeting] -John would be three now. Michael would be five. What if we contacted the adoption agency one more time? -I know I should be happy when a birth mom changes her mind and keeps her baby. But my heart just can't take it again. I'm sorry. -I understand. [car engine revving] -Hey. -Hi. I can't go home. -I know. I know. You stay here. I'll go home and get our stuff. -Are we doing the right thing? -Yes. Yes. -Okay. Okay. -He is gonna be all right. -[sobbing] Okay. Okay. -All right. I'll be right back. -Okay. -There's the man, the legend. How are you feeling, Captain America? -Hey, buddy. Feeling pretty weak. -Hey, you know, Cap was weak and puny before he transformed. -How's our superhero feeling? -I am, I'm no superhero. -Can I help you? -Oh, yeah, can I get some more of this? -Are you family? -Oh, I'm more than family. -[Susan] Hi, you're awake! -Hi, Mom. [Nate] They can vouch for me. -We've never seen this man in our entire life. -Hey! -He's fine. Just keep security nearby. -Well, David's doing great. I'll, uh, be back in a few minutes to change his meds. [Susan] Thank you. -Hey, we brought pasta! -Oh, I love pasta. -[David] Thank you, thank you, thank you. -Hi. -Hey. -How're you feeling? -I'm good. -Well, we talked to the doctors. And they relieved the pressure, and he said that you shouldn't have any -Okay. Thanks, God. -Yeah, a lot of people have been praying for you. -Hey the doctor also said no more wrestling. -What? Ever? -I'm so sorry, sweetheart. -Hey God got you through this. That's not a little thing. I don't think we should take that for granted. -Honey. [David] No way. [Susan] It was just the anesthesia talking. [David] I don't remember saying any of that. [Susan] Oh, you weren't just talking. You were singing your heart out. [David] No. Dad, was I seriously singing? -Hey, guys, listen to this. [Abagail] Hello, Mr. Colton. This is Abagail over at Kirsh & Clark. I just wanted to call and inform you that Melissa Cates, David's birth mother, has updated her records. Now that David is of legal age, he has the right to contact his birth parents if he is interested. You're welcome to call back if you'd like more information. Feel free to let us know, and have a great day. -Wow. I, um, she's right. You're old enough now. -David, what do you think? -I don't know. -We need to talk about this. I mean, do you think you might wanna meet your birth mom? -I don't know, okay? It's a lot to think about. -Yeah. Well, you don't have to do anythi It's okay. -Dad, I don't even know if I want her back in my life. I don't even know her. I mean, so is meeting her-- -Yeah, I, I'm, I'm not pushing you to do that, honey. -No, no, there's no, there's no rush at all. Just because she called doesn't mean we have to We have time. We have time to decide, we're not gonna jump into the van and go meet her. -That's right. But you know what I was thinking? We might want to respond in some way, right? So maybe a letter for an update? -Okay. I mean, fine. You can send her one if you want to. I'm gonna shower and go to bed. -Still no headaches, right? [David] No headaches. -Great. We cannot rush him. -I know, I'm sorry. But I got to thinking. You know, wouldn't it be kinda cool for her to see him all grown up? You know? I mean, she took a really big risk on us. -Yeah. -She'd be so proud of him. -She would be. -Yeah. Yeah. -Um, I'm gonna go to the store. I, I gotta get some diapers and some wipes and couple other things. Um, for the Millers' baby shower. -Oh. -On Saturday. Um it kinda reminds me. Uh, they don't have a crib yet, and I was thinking, you know, that maybe we could give them ours? [somber music] -[exhales] Can we take a little time to think about that? -Uh, of course. Yeah, because uh, I would only want to do that, you know, if you wanted to do that, so Okay, I'm gonna go to the store. And um, thank you for doing the dishes. -Love you. [Susan] I love you. [door closes] [somber music] -Yes, uh, my name is Jimmy Colton, and I'd like to resubmit our letter and application, please. [knocking] -Hey. -[David] Hey. -Hey, can I show you something? [David] Yeah, sure. Who's this? -You remember asking to see that when you were about eight? -Dad, is that Brian and Melissa? -Yeah. We stopped for lunch on the way home from church. And out of the blue, you asked us if you could meet your birth mother. And so, Mom, uh, asked what you would say to her if you could meet her. And you said, "I would say, hi, my name is David". -[chuckles] -And then you asked us if we had a picture of them, so when we got home, I showed that to you. And you looked at it for a minute, and you said, "Wow, they look like nice people". And you gave it back to me. -How old were they? -[inhales] I think she was 18 and he was 17. She was pregnant when she graduated. Think about that. Imagine how scared she must have been. And then, deciding to place you for adoption must have been the hardest decision of her entire life. But I'm so glad she did it. David God gave you to me and Mom as a gift. And you'll always be our son. [gentle uplifting music] -Is this how you want your baby to live? [Melissa] Our baby. We could move back in with my dad. -[inhales] Well then, you're gonna have to tell him. And you already know he's not going to let you keep it. We got this place to get away from him and now you wanna go back? Melissa, we haven't even eaten today. [birds chirping] -What are you doing? You're gotta put it through the eye. -I got it. I know how to bait my own hook. Look, I can't be a father right now. I can't. Maybe one day, but I We gotta finish school. I gotta get a job. -I can't just turn this off, Brian. It may feel like you can because you're not the one carrying it, but I can't do that. -I just wanna do what's best for us, Melissa. -Yeah. I just wanna do what's best for the baby. [soft music] [Brian] I honestly had no idea that this many people wanted to adopt. -Look at this couple. -Um, no. He looks weird. -No, he doesn't. Okay, yeah, he does. [exhales deeply] -What are we even looking for? -People like us. At least people that like what we like. Like, better people than us, but people that would like us if they knew us. [Brian] You're weird. -No, I'm not. -Yeah, you are. -Well, you're living with me, so what does that make you? [chuckles] [Brian] "Dear Mother, as honored as I was "to win the prestigious title, Miss Sout "now all I want is the title, Mommy. And that's where you come in." This is Ugh. -Listen to this. "We like to go camping and fishing, and we love outdoor activities." "And we've lost two boys to Aicardi syndrome "at a very early age "We don't care if it's a boy or a girl, we just want to be parents." -Do you wanna put them on the wall? -Yes, but I kinda want to ask them a question. -What do you wanna ask? -I wonder if I can call. -I don't think you can do that. -No, I can, through the agency, yeah. -You really want to call them? [phone ringing] -Hello? Yes. Um, okay. Just a moment. Susan it's the adoption agency. There's a birth mother on the line with a question for you. -For me? -I resubmitted our application. -You did? Is she she's on the phone right now? Hello? [Melissa] Hi, is this Susan? -Yes. -Um, I just wanted to ask you a question. -Okay. -Um, you said on your letter that you like to go fishing, and I just wanna know how you bait your hook? -Uh When, when we go fishing, uh, we use the, the Cocahoe Minnow, and you have to put the hook through the eye of the minnow. That's the way I've always baited my hook. -Um, that's really good. Um Then I want you to be the mother. -What? What? What did she say? -She wants me to be the mom. -What? That's, that's wonderful! -I didn't know you were gonna do that, Jimmy. -Oh, no. Honey, just listen. -[crying] -I'm, I'm sorry. I I'm just not ready to let go. -And I can't go through another loss. -Honey-- -Just can't do it. -Sit down, sit down. Listen to me. Sit down, sit down. -She might call and change her mind. -No, but we don't know that. She, she just called and said she chose you. -Yeah. Yeah. -We wanna trust God, right? No matter what happens. We want what's best for the child and what's best for the birth mother. And, and even if she decides to keep the baby, can can we just take this step together and trust God with it? -I just don't -Okay, just one step at a time. -Just one step. Okay. Okay, just one step. [Jimmy] [whispers] One step at a time. -[takes a deep breath] Hmm. [chuckles happily] [uplifting music] -Okay, listen, I didn't say I was gonna do it. You know, I'm just thinking about doing it. -Bro, look, I'm really proud of you. -All right. Okay. -And I know you love your family, but you've never really seemed okay with being adopted. I mean, you've basically tried to hide it. -I have not tried to hide it. -Yes, you have. -Not talking about it doesn't mean I've -Look at me. Are you okay with people knowing that yo -Yes. Mostly. Not really. -See, I don't know why. You have a great family. You know, most people would kill to have a family like yours or mine. -Nate! I didn't say you could take my car. I said that I would meet you at my car. Come on, give me my keys, I'm late for work! Hey, David. -Reese. -Hey, did Mom drive you? -Craig did. -Craig? You're back together with Craig? [Reese] Mind your own business, Nate! And take that video down now before anyone else sees it. -You posted it? -Well, we'll catch up later, all right? Catch me up then. Uh, I'm gonna need a ride home. -You drove me here. -That's not good. [David] Mr. Russell. -Hey, David. What's up? -Um Listen, I was, uh thinking more about that whole speech thing. -Yeah, and? -I'm thinking I might, uh, try it. -Really? That's, uh That's great. What made you change your mind? -I guess I just needed some perspective. I can certainly understand that. [chuckles] [mellow music] [door bangs shut] -[inhales deeply] [enchanting music] [baby gurgles] -Hi. God, if you're there, please protect him and watch over him. [sniffling] [Anna] It's not just the home we walk into, or the meals we share. It's the knowledge that, whatever comes, hardship or celebration, the ones we love will be there to share those moments, to amplify the joys, and to help carry the burdens. It's God's beautiful design, of this gift we call family. Thank you. [audience applause] [Mr. Russell] Thank you, Anna. Our last speaker this evening is also a senior, who decided to enter just two days ago. Please welcome, David Colton. [audience applause] -Uh I've always wondered if my biological parents think about me. And I guess, maybe, it bothers me when people know that I'm, uh adopted. But it really shouldn't bother me. Um Because no matter the circumstances, I now have a family who chose to adopt me, and who loves me. And yet, for some reason, I struggle to be content with that. I guess, maybe I didn't want to feel different, or less valued. But I think a lot of those thoughts are only in my head, and they aren't actually reality. And when I step back and look at my life from a wider perspective, I see how much a gift my parents really are, and that adoption has brought us together in a unique and beautiful way. And because I'm absolutely sure that their lives would be a lot more boring without me th [audience chuckling] -Um, so, so, the more I live my life, the more I believe that there's really no reason to feel differently. We don't all take the same path. But I'm thankful for the family that God's given me. When I think of family, I think of home. And I wouldn't trade that for the world. Thank you. [audience applause] -[boys whooping] -[laughing] [sighs heavily] -The judges have made their decisions. -I think I handled wrestling better. -The winning speech, and the 500-dollar cash prize goes to Sandra Benham. [audience applause] -Ah, I may have read this in the wrong order. This year's runner up-- -There's a runner up? And a check for 250 dollars goes to David Colton. [audience applause] -Oh, David! [upbeat party music] -Yo, David! -What's up, man? -Swooping in and taking the win. -What's up, guys? I did not expect to win anything. -Honestly, same, but you beat us, so there's that. -That's true, yeah. -I'm sorry. -Oh, snacks. -At least Anna didn't win again this year. I mean, she always-- -Shh, shh, dude, look. -Anna! Great job on your speech. Congrats. [Sam] Rough. -Rough. -Oh, we got Dana and Macy go in the house. Let's go. It's game time, it's game time. Excuse us, gentlemen, we're on it. Let's get it. -Hey, so get this. You know the graduation video? -Yes. -The one with the baby faces and the names and all their information and stuff? I get to do it this year. I told the school I'd charge 500 bucks, and they went for it. Hashtag debt free, you know what I mean? -Yeah, yeah. Yeah, dude. Um -What's up? "David, this is Melissa. "I don't care for social networking, "so please forgive me. "please let your parents know that I'm reaching out to you. "I'm willing to tell you anything you want to know. "I do not want to hide anything. "All I can say is, wow, "they raised the most wonderful boy I've ever laid eyes on." That is mushy. -Wow. -Dude, is that your birth mom? -I'm gonna go call my parents. -Yeah, dude, step out. [sighs deeply] Hey, hey, hey, uh, you there, what I'm Nate, let's talk about something. I'm, uh [Brian] Yeah, I I know. Melissa, Melissa, listen. Melissa. I know that he is 18, but why now? No. No, no, I'm not trying to say that there's a perfect time for something like this. I'm, I'm just Yeah. No, I get it. I get it. And you are free to talk to him if that is what you wanna do. Okay. Yeah, listen, I gotta go. Thanks. Thanks for the call. [somber music] -Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Are you serious? -[sobbing] -What are you thinking? Come on, answer me! What are you thinking? -I wanna go home, Brian. -Well, well, do you wanna have a kid in high school? Is that what you want? -Can we please just go home? -Is that, is that what you want? -[sobbing] -What are you gonna do? Melissa! What are you going to do? -I don't know. [Brian] You don't know. -Well, she was a ball of energy tonight. We should have put her down at eight before she caught her second wind. -Yeah. -Hey, uh What are you thinking? You hadn't said one word this entire night. -I, uh There's something I need to tell you. -Okay. -It's something I should have told you a But uh -Brian, what is it? -I have a son. -A son? With um with Melissa? -Yeah. I was still in high school. And I've just had a hard time telling anyone. I'm so sorry. I should have told you. -Yeah. Okay. Okay. Look at me. I am here for you, no matter what. -Okay. Okay. -I think it's a good first response as long as you're sure you don't want it to go any further. -Yeah, but Dad, I don't know how far I want this to go. I mean, I don't even know her. A part of me wants to know what my life would've been like. But my only problem is, thinking it might be best not to get involved at all, so -Yeah, would, would be safer to just leave it alone. You know, just Just let them live their life. Then again, it could be really healing for Melissa to hear from you, and, and see what an amazing man you've become. Did you look up Brian? -Yeah. Yeah, no, I did. Um But I mean, he never posts really anything, so -Hmm. Well, maybe if you respond to Melissa, you could reach out to him too. Either way, we'll support you. [notification beeps] -Oh, Nate is coming over a little later to interview me. -Interview you? -Oh, he wants to film this whole thing and make it like a documentary. It's Nate. -Should be interesting. All right, David. Later. -Later. [keyboard keys clacking] -Stars! Airplane! I see an airplane. #Um, you might want to look at this. I can respond if you want. -Okay, good. -I always wondered why they put me up for adoption. I guess I just put it out of my mind because I didn't want to be different. -You didn't want to be an idiot? -I didn't want to be different. Different. -Okay, good, that's a lot better. Let's go with that. But next time, give me more. -More what? -I don't know, more emotion, something e Look, dude, I need to feel it in your words. I need to see it in those eyes, okay? -What? What are you talking about? -You have the emotion of a rock. I need you to pull me in a little bit. Talk about not fitting in, and I don't know, just, just don't hold anything back, all right? Give it all to me. -Okay. -[Nate] Okay. -Sure. -Are you ready? And Action. -I didn't want to be different! I just wanted to fit in! [Nate] Dude, are you kidding me? -What is wrong with me right now? -Okay, all right, that's a cut. That's a cut. -I'm I'm, I'm so emotional right now. [giggling] [Nate] Such a diva. [David] I'm so emotional. [notification beeps] Oh, it's Brian's wife. My birth father's wife. -Oh, okay, hold on. Let me, let me get this. Right, okay, you ready? Go. -"Um This is a lot for Brian to process. "He wants to take it slow. I'm sorry if this isn't what you were hoping for." -How does that make you feel? -He doesn't want to talk, so -Dude -Oh, I'm sorry. He doesn't wanna talk to me! -Okay. Are you serious? [David] Does that work? -Are you guys okay? -Oh, I'm trying to get some amount of emotion out of this heart of stone. -Oh, bless you, honey. -Thanks, Mom. -[notification beeps] -No way! [Susan] What is it? -I just got a message back from Melissa. -What did she say? [David] She wants to meet. -Really? -Yeah. -Wow. Wow! -Okay, wait.

Let's do this. And action. -I just wish he'd open up to me more, you know? -Do you think maybe you're just prying too much? -I'm not trying to pry. It's just that is he even going about this the right way? -Honey, do you think there is a certain way that he should be going about this? -[sighs] All right. You know what it is? I, I've been picturing this moment ever since he was a little guy. And, and now we're here. And I just thought we would I don't know, take this journey together. Instead, he's upstairs on his computer. And unless he tells me what he's doing, I really don't know what he's doing. -David's gotta want to do this for himself.

[Paw Paw] Yeah, now, pull the burnt part off, put the rest of it back down in there and get some more brown on it. [G] Well, that's how you got your fingers all sticky. [Paw Paw] Well, of course I do. [David] Hey, so, um Melissa said she and her husband actually don't live that far from Brian and Azure. [fire crackling] [Susan] Did Brian give a reason for not being ready to talk? -Um No. No, he didn't. Um, I guess it's just a lot for him to process. -How is Melissa? -She's nice. Um I mean, she's a little paranoid of social media. Um [Jimmy] Yeah, I can understand that. I don't really like it either. -I mean, we've, you know, we've written back and forth several tim I mean, she still wants to meet. And, uh I'm thinking about it. [fire crackling] -Do you know what'd you say to her? [fire crackling] -"Thank you". [Paw Paw] I'd thank her, too. She gave us our grandson. -Yeah, she did. -[Paw Paw] Yeah. [dart landing on tree] -Beat ya! -Yeah. -You owe me a back-rub. That's two out of three. -I can count. Still, just one more. -[dart bouncing off] -[laughs] -All right, what's the deal? -You're throwing it like a baseball. -Best three out of five. -I knew you were gonna say that. You can't change the rules. -[laughing] I won. [Shawn] So how's David? -[sighing] I don't know. I mean, he's cordial. But I say a lot, he says a little. -Well, that can't be surprising to you. -I know I talk too much. [dart landing on tree] But I just [exhaling loudly] It'd be nice to actually see him. [dart landing on tree] -Why don't you ask God for it? -Oh, I have. Like, a lot. [sighing] [somber music] [bright music] Can you grill the chicken too, please? -Yeah. [phone ringing] -Just hit speaker. [Shawn] Hello? [Mandy] Hi, I'm looking for Melissa Cates. -I'm here. [Mandy] This is Mandy from Kirsh and Clark. We've, uh, received a message from David Colton. He said that you guys have been talking over the internet, and he's open to meeting in person. But, of course, that would have to be acceptable to both parties. -Oh, um, yes. Yes, we are. We'd be happy to meet in person. Where do we need to go? [Mandy] Well, apparently, he's willing to come to you. -He is? [Mandy] Yes, ma'am. How would you like us to respond? [hopeful music] -Right, uh, tell us what you're doing, what you're about to go do? -Okay, so, uh, I wrote my parents and my grandparents letters because there's a few things I wanted to tell them before I go and meet my birth mom. Uh, before Mom and Dad and I go to Indiana, I wanted to share something with you, guys. When the idea of going to visit my birth mom first came up, I thought it would make things uncomfortable. But a part of me wanted to fill this missing piece of the puzzle. -Hon, do you feel that something has been missing from your life? -I, I guess I shouldn't say "missing piece of the puzzle". I It's more about asking the question of what my life would have been like. And, just simply thanking Melissa for the choice that she made. -Honey, puzzles are a big part of life, right? And if you want to fill in a piece that you don't have, we're all for it. -I think that this trip might even be a discovery of how big that piece is. [Susan] Hmm. -And not just for you, but for, for all of us. -I guess I just wanted to share something with the most significant people in my life. -[chuckles] -[David] So uh [clears throat] I wrote you these. -Oh, here you go. -[melodic music] -[papers rustling] [Susan] "I'm not sure how either of you feels "when you think about Melissa and Brian, "and how I'm not your birth son, "and that bothers me sometimes. "I hope the fact that they're my birth parents "never deters you from realizing that th "are my true parents. "And I hope that I never do anything to make it seem like I don't know that." Honey that never bothers me a bit. -[sobbing] [Susan] It's irrelevant. Oh, David, I love you. -[sobbing] -I'm gonna treasure this. -We both will. -I just don't want anyone to feel replaced. -I already know you love us. Now I just have proof. [all laugh] [funky music] -[laughs] -You don't have to film everything, you know. [Nate] I'm not. Just almost everything. Now, tell me what you're thinking. -I'm thinking you don't have to film everything. -Dude, this is why I came. Trust my genius. It's all part of it. "David Steps Out, and Finds Himself Within". -What does that mean? -Well, it's the title of the movie. -That's dumb. -Okay, what about, "Journey of Uncertainty"? -That's worse. -"Questie with My Bestie"? -Stop. -Fine. You'll thank me one day. Hey, where are we meeting your parents? [David] Uh, at the hotel. I can't believe they decided to drive this far. -Yeah, that's commitment. -[door creaks open] -Well, you're their only kid, so Ah, luxury! I call top bunk! [funky music] -Okay, I'm heading over there. I'll be back in about an hour. You really should tell him before he gets here. -I know. I know. -Okay. [door closing] [funky music] [phone dinging] -Oh, wow! -What? -It's Melissa. I need to tell you something that I have -Well, what is it? -Oh, I don't know. It says she's still typing. -Dude, what if she won the lottery and she's loaded? She won the lottery and she's loaded, and when we get there, there's gonna be like a massive house. -No. -Or maybe she feels bad that she's loaded, and she didn't tell you. -What? -So when you get there, she's gonna give you a portion and then you're gonna be loaded too! -She stopped typing. [Melissa sighing] -What did she say? -She hasn't sent anything. -Okay. All right, look. The minute you get the text back, I need you to read it out and with a big reaction, okay? -She's still typing! -[growls] -What's the rush? -I gotta go to the bathroom. -[David] Then go! -I can't miss your reaction. Okay, don't read it until I get back, okay? -[exhales] -[sighing] -[exhales] -[phone dinging] -Oh, wow! [exhaling in disbelief] Oh, wow. Oh, wow. [Nate] Did you respond? Did she read it? Did you respond? You have a sister. You have a You have a sister? -Mm-mm. -[Nate] Dude! This is crazy! This is like This is like Luke, I am your father! -I'm pretty sure it's not the same thing. -This is huge! What's her name? Is it Is it Leia? Is it Rey? [David] Her name's Courtney, and she's 12. [Nate] This is incredible! Oh, okay, this is good. All right. [clears throat] Sorry. Let's do this. Really focus in on me. Give me a good reaction like you just got the text for the first time. You ready? Okay? And Go. -I have a sister. -Can you pull tears? [bright music] [Susan] [into phone] What? Are you serious? -What? What is it? -Melissa just told David that he has a 12-year-old sister! [laughs] I can't believe it! [laughing in disbelief] [bright music] [bright music] [knocking] -Hey, what's up, Mrs. C? -Hi. Is David ready? -Uh, he's still powdering his nose so he can-- -[David] No, I'm not! Hey, Mom. -Hey. Oh, that's nice. I like that. [David] Yeah. -[sighing] So, did you ever hear from Br -Uh, no. Not at this point, I'm not really expecting to. -Ah, did you did you have enough breakfast this morning? -Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good. You know, I'm a little nervous, but uh -Yeah. -I'm okay. -Okay. -Yeah. -Good. [sighing] -You all right? -Who, me? Oh, yeah, pfft, I'm good. I'm real good. -All right. -Yeah. Um So, so Dad's down in the lobby, and I'm gonna go meet him. And you just come down in like ten minutes, is that good? -Okay. Okay. -Bye. -Bye. Hey, hey, Mom? -Yeah? [melodic music] -Look, I'm I know I don't say it enough but, uh I love you. You are and always will be my mom. -David. Thank you. Um I think I really needed to hear that today. I love you. [melodic music] -David, what makes you most nervous? -Um I guess, just to see what they're like, to see um What traits I may have gotten from them. -Environment plays a very big part. -Yeah, yeah, I gotta know where I get all my good looks from, so [Nate chuckles] -I think we're almost there. [birds chirping] [mellow music] [Susan] She's gonna be out right now. -[sobbing] [David] I love you. It's good to meet you. -[crying] -Hey, can I have a hug too? Hi. I love you. I love you. Thank you. -Melissa, it's good to see you. -You too. [sobbing] I want you to meet someone. [♪♪] -Hi, Courtney. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you too. -Hi, I'm David. -Shawn Cates. Good to meet you, David. -Nice to meet you too, man. -Hey, Shawn Cates. -Jimmy Colton. Pleasure to meet you. [Shawn] Good to meet you. -Hi, how are you? -[Shawn] Good. -Good to see you. -Nice to meet you. -Oh. Everybody, come inside. -Nice to meet you. Yeah, you guys, make yourself at home. Have a seat. [Susan] Thank you. Happy tears. -I know. I've been crying all day. [sniffles] I'm sorry. I wanna say so much, and I don't even know where to start. -I, I'll I'll start. Um well, first off, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for making the choice that you did almost 19 years ago, to uh let me be adopted. I mean, you allowed me to have the life that I have now. And actually I, um I was wondering if I could hear your story, and why you made the choice that you did. [Melissa] Okay. Um it was a confusing time. Scary, you know? Your adoption was hard and easy, all at the same time. I mean, going through those "Dear Mother" letters was overwhelming. -How many letters did you read through? -I don't even know. A lot. But I just knew, when I got your parents' letter, I knew. I wanted your mom to be down to earth. Basically, someone like me what I could have been. To do the things I wanted to do with you, but I knew I couldn't. I wanted you to have a mom to be there for you, and she couldn't be afraid to get her hands dirty. -Do you remember calling me? -I do. I do. -My hands were shaking. I didn't know what to expect. -When I was getting further and further into your story into your parents' story, it just grabbed me. Your parents seemed to be genuine. They seemed to have genuine faith. So, were you mad at me? -Never. -Did you ever think that I didn't want you? -Um -Uh, I would understand if you did. -Uh, no. No, I'm I think I just wondered if you ever thought about me. That was my only concern. Listen I'm so grateful for my life. But I had a hard time telling people that I was adopted because I hadn't really realized what that meant yet. But I'm glad that I'm adopted. -I thought about you every day. When you know your baby's not coming home with you I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous. There's about every emotion you could feel. But I knew you were going to the right place. [crying] -Thank you. I've had a great life. [Melissa] I know you have. -That's because of you. You gave that to me. -Thank you. [phone ringing] [Jimmy] That was Brian. He's agreed to meet with you. -Wow. Really? -He just asked if we could let him know sometime today. [upbeat music] [David exhales deeply] [Susan laughs] [upbeat music] -Hey, David, I wanted to ask you something. -Yeah, sure. What's up? -Oh. -Don't mind me, I'm just filming everything. By the way, this is gold. -So, I'm kind of a tomboy, and like a little adventure. Shawn does too, as long as it doesn't include heights. I've seen your cliff jumping videos, and I wondered if you would do something with me. -Yeah, what's up? -Would you go skydiving with me while you're here? No one will go with me. -Yeah, are, are you kidding? I've I've always wanted to go, and no one will ever take me! Mom, Dad, can we? -Uh, we'll, we'll watch from the ground. -[laughs] I'm in. -Really? -Yeah. -Yes! -Let's do it! Let's go tomorrow. -[Melissa] Let's go tomorrow. -[David] Let's do it! Hey, did you get some good stuff? -Hah, incredible. This was the best day I've ever photographed. -You know, I guess since you're the official videographer, that means you have to like, film everything, right? -Yeah. Duh. -Good. Then you're coming skydiving with us. -Ha! No, no. No, no. Nate is not jumping. That won't happen. Never. Ever. -[mischievous music] -[Nate screaming] No, no, no. -Jump, Nate! Just jump! -I don't wanna jump. Why are you my friend? Why are you my friend? [screaming] [both laugh] [Nate screaming] -Hey, let's do it! See you there! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! -[instructor] Ready? -Yeah, let's do it! Whoo! Yeah, all right! [laughing] -Melissa's got a little adventure in her. -She sure does. -Yeah! -David seems to be pretty even-keeled. -Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! -This Nate fella -Oh my God, is this right? Oh my God, is this right? -He looks a little dramatic. -Please! Please! [screaming] [Jimmy] Maybe a touch. [Melissa] I love this! Yeah! [funky music] Whoo! [David] Whoo! All right! [Melissa] Yeah! Wasn't that a rush? -It was a rush. -Did you like it? -I did! It's amazing! -Yeah! We did it. -Wow! Wow, wow, wow, wow. [Nate screaming] -Hey! Did you survive over there? -[panting] So not worth it! So not worth it. [both laughing] [Nate] I'm just gonna take a minute. You guys, go ahead. Lord Jesus, thank you for bringing me ba -Hey, I don't know how much time you have before you leave, but after you meet with Brian, can I show you one more thing? -Yeah, sure. Um How about this, uh, Saturday morning? Does that work? -Perfect. -Awesome. [Nate] We're going to dinner still, right? -[laughing] -So you're not gonna tell me what it is? -Not yet. -[laughs] [somber music] -Ready? -More than ever. -He said we can just go around the back. -All right. -Take a moment, and slow it down. [somber music] -Presley, baby, come here. [Brian] Hey. -What's up, Brian? -What's up? Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Uh, don't let the camera guy weird you out. Um This is uh Nate. -Nice to meet you. -My best friend. He wanted to help us remember all of this. -Yeah, well, I'll do my best to ignore you. The guy with the camera. [all chuckling] -Well, come on, sit. -[David] Sure, uh Hi. -[Azure] Hi. -Yeah, Azure. [David] Thank you. Thank you. -[Brian] Hey. -[Jimmy] Brian. Nice to meet you. -Glad y'all came out. Come on, just, uh Just grab a spot. Hey. -[Susan] Nice to meet you. -You too. Please, um -Hey, uh I just wanna say thank you, uh for letting us stop by. Very kind of you. -Yeah, yeah, you're welcome. -Yeah. -You know, I've, I've been carrying this secret with me for almost two decades now. So Didn't tell my wife until a couple weeks ago. Yeah, and that was a relief. You know, my my mom was adopted. Yeah, her mom couldn't raise her and You know, she hated her for it, so I always figured that you'd hate me too. -No. I-I-I don't hate you at all. -It's good to hear. Um you know, that's why I had such a hard time, uh choosing adoption. Because of that. But now that I look back at it, I you know, the other option that we considered was worse. Much worse. And I'm sorry. It's kinda foolish to think about now. -Um I, I I actually wanted to, to thank you. I mean, you're part of the reason I have all of this, you know. Thank you. [melodic music] [Jimmy] So, Presley is five years old? -Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, I guess, uh I guess she would be David's half-sister, huh? -Yeah. -Thank you. For raising him in a way that I know I never could. I, um I'm certain that he's gonna go much farther than I ever did. [mellow music] -No, no, Reese, you No, you have to tell Mom and Dad. No, you don't know that. Just Just calm down, okay? Listen I, I know. I know but Okay. All right. I-I-I get it, yeah. Okay, I'll talk to you later. [David] Whoa! Hey. You good, man? -No, I'm not. -Hey, hey, hey. What's up? -My sister She got back with her idiot boyfriend. And she's pregnant. -[sighs] Dude -You can't tell anybody, all right? -No, I won't. All right? -[scoffs] Why, dude? She said she was done with him! [sighs heavily] [rumble of traffic] -[David] Dad, there's Melissa. -[Jimmy] Okay. Oh, where? [David] Right over there. -[sighs] [car doors open] -Hey. -Hey. Thanks for meeting me here. -Yeah, of course. Uh So, where are we? -Nineteen years ago, when I found out that I was pregnant Brian and I drove here together. This fence was lined with protesters. I came here to have an abortion. When I got out, they put a blanket over my head and a radio beside each ear to drown out all the noise. -We're gonna put this over your head to protect you. [protestors shouting] [Melissa] [voice-over] As I was walking in, even with all the noise [protester 1] You're not alone, don't do it. [Melissa] [voice-over] I could still hear their voices. I heard this woman say [protester 1] Your baby has ten fingers and ten toes. Please, please, don't kill it! -"Your baby has ten fingers and ten toes. Please don't kill it." [sniffles] [exhaling] So we get inside. And they make you pay immediately. [sobs and exhales] So I go back, I had my gown on. I sat down on a cold table. There was a tray with all these tools on it. And the door opens, and the doctor walks in, puts on a new pair of gloves, sat down on a little silver chair and scooted across the room. Told me to put my feet in the stirrups. [sighs] I laid back, turned my head. And I heard the words, "Get up, there's still time". Right when he went to touch me, I said, "I can't do this." He just backed up, ripped his gloves off, threw them in the trash and left. He didn't say a word to me. So I got up and left. They don't protect you when you leave. They protect you when you come in. So all those people they thought I did it. [dramatic music] Those few seconds You wouldn't be standing here. I would have killed you. [both sobbing] -I'm so sorry. [sobbing] -Don't be. You let me live. You've nothing to be sorry for. [both laughing] -Thank you, thank you, thank you. [♪♪] [rumble of train] -I don't know what I'm gonna tell her. -Tell who? -Reese. I just You know, she's probably thinking the same thing that Melissa did. Dude, her her baby could be somebody's best friend one day. [David] Hey. Could I talk to her? -Maybe. [exhaling] She's pretty stubborn, dude. Hey What about Parker Avenue? "I almost died on Parker Avenue." -Ooh, it's a little morbid. -[Nate chuckles] -Um How about, "I Lived on Parker Avenue?" Mmm? Get it? -All right, okay. I like it. I might use it. Maybe. [somber music] -So, now you have a full sister and a ha -Um Yeah. -[scoffs] Isn't that kinda weird? -Yeah, it is weird. But, you know, it's also kinda awesome. You know, I-I-I just assumed I was an only child. [David] So what now? Will you still see your biological family? -The Coltons are my family. But, you know, if everyone's okay with it, we'll definitely keep up with each other. -I, uh I'm not sure it's always like that. -Yeah, maybe not. But I can tell you that [sighs] I'm so glad she got off that table. I'm so glad that I'm I'm here. Reese I was at that abortion clinic 19 years ago, in her womb. And she let me live. You know, I can only thank God for that. There's already so much death. You could give life. Life that is already inside of you. If you and Craig aren't ready, there are many, many men and women out there who are ready to be parents. Just like mine. Would you at least think about it? [hopeful music] [Melissa] "Melissa, this is to mark the day you chose life." -Lifemark. I'm proud of you.
