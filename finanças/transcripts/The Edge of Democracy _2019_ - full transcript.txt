[car rattling] [indistinct chatter] [man 1, in Portuguese] Careful there. [reporter 1] No one expected such a quick arrest. It took everyone by surprise. [reporter 2, in English] A stunning blow for a man who was elected president twice and left office with an approval rating over 80%. In fact, he was already planning his comeback. He's leading in the polls for presidential elections next year. [reporter 3, in Portuguese] The deadlineset for ex-president Lula for Lula to serve prison time for the triplex apartment charges has ended. [men chanting] He will not leave! He will not leave! He will not leave! He will not leave! He will not leave! Where is he? -[Lula] Maria. -[man 2] Oh, my God. Maria... Come on, no crying! Hey, Luiza Erundina! Look how strong she is. [kisses] -Bye. -[Luiza kisses] Lula, I'm with you. [crowd chanting] Lula in prison! Lula in prison! Lula in prison! [all chanting] Out with PT (Workers' Party)! Out with PT! [man 3 over megaphone] If that crook Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stays free, -he'll lead the country into a civil war! -[sirens wailing in distance] [reporter 4] For now, there's no solution yet. Many patrol cars, many police vehicles are approaching. [crowd chanting] Don't let them jail him! Circle in, circle in! Don't let them jail him! [gentle piano music playing] [narrator, in English] Imagine a country that took its name from a tree. Brazilwood. Its red ink led it to the brink of extinction. Only the name remains. A country where more slaves died than were born. It was cheaper to import another one from Africa. Where every rebellion was brutally crushed, and the Republic proclaimed by military generals. A country that, after 21 years of dictatorship, established its democracy and became an inspiration to much of the world. It seemed Brazil had finally broken its curse. But here we are. With one president impeached, another imprisoned, and the nation moving rapidly towards its authoritarian past. Today, as I feel the ground opening, I fear our democracy was nothing but a short-lived dream. [woman 1, in Portuguese] Blow it. Blow it! Don't do it with your finger. Look, Aninha! -[girl] Blow it! Ana, like this. -[woman 2] Blow it, Petra. [woman 3] Put on some fun music! Ana Petra loves it. [Petra, in English] When I was born, we couldn't vote for president. [young Petra babbles] The military dictatorship was completing its 20th year. One of my first memories, I'm on top of my mother's shoulders seeing a sea of people screaming. [crowd clamoring on TV] [man 1, in Portuguese] Four, five mill! We want to vote for president of Brazil! [Petra, in English] Brazilian democracy and I are almost the same age, and I thought that in our 30s we would both be standing on solid ground. -[man 2, in Portuguese] Direct elections! -[crowd] Now! -[man 2] Direct elections! -[crowd] Now! -[man 2] Direct elections! -[crowd] Now! [crowd singing Brazilian national anthem] [Petra, in English] This is my mother. She and my father had spent the '70s in hiding, fighting against the military dictatorship. I WANT TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT [film projector whirring] [Petra] After briefly going to prison, they moved to the south of Brazil. For a decade, their family had no idea where they lived. [indistinct chatter] [Petra] Disguised as a salesman and a teacher, they organized workers and students against the regime. [crowd clamoring] [Petra] Many of their movement were tortured, others, killed. Amongst them, their leader, Pedro Pomar. I was named Petra in his memory. [band playing military march] [Petra] And the democratic revolution didn't come. -[crowd clamoring] -[high-pitched ringing] [dog barks] [Petra] But a shift happens when massive strikes would give the dictatorship a strong blow. [man, in Portuguese] Our union is under siege! We're being horribly oppressed! Our union is surrounded by military trucks. [Petra, in English] The strikes are led by this man. A steelworker and union leader, Lula is 33 years old in the image. He only became interested in politics after he visited Congress for the first time and realized that, of the 443 congressmen, only two were of the working class. [crowd chanting in Portuguese] Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! [Lula over loudspeaker] We all know that around the world, workers never got anything... without struggle, without perseverance, and without fighting until the end. [crowd cheers] There's work to be done in neighborhoods, there's work to be done at bus stops. And more importantly, no one goes to the factory doors! [crowd cheers and applauds] [air horn blows] [crowd chanting] Lula! Lula! Lula! [rhythmic instrumental music playing] [Petra, in English] My mother said that she saw in him the embodiment of all she had longed for: workers becoming political actors, opening the way towards a democratic path. And in 1980, he leads the creation of the Workers' Party. [in Portuguese] We're thinking of creating a political party to see if the workers, at least somewhere in the world, get the chance to be represented with dignity. [Petra, in English] Runs for president in '89... [in Portuguese] To end inflation, we'll have to attack it at its roots, and that's the bankers, the businessmen. [Petra, in English] ...and loses. In '94... [in Portuguese] For the low paid worker, the priority is a pay raise. [Petra, in English] ...and loses. In '98... [in Portuguese] It's time for a government that guarantees economic stability, supporting all who want to plant, produce, and create jobs. [Petra, in English] ...and loses. Until, in 2002, he decides to compromise. [in Portuguese] ...to say also to the businessmen, that Brazil really needs them. [man, in Portuguese] Marília's giving Petra instructions. [in English] Feminist voting here, huh? [in Portuguese] Her daughter's political education. We're choosing a woman for Congress. [in English] For the first time, voting in a historical election. [camera shutter clicks] [indistinct chatter] -[in Portuguese] Bye. -[man 2] Bye. [passengers cheering] [Lula] Brazil gained wealth from the mills and sugarcane plantations in early colonial times. But it didn't beat hunger. It declared its independence and abolished slavery, but it didn't beat hunger. It knew wealth from gold mines in Minas Gerais and coffee plantations in the Paraiba Valley, but it didn't beat hunger. It became industrialized... [Petra, in English] I was 19 when Lula got elected, and I remember the excitement that wasn't just in me. It had taken over the streets. [Lula, in Portuguese] While there's a single Brazilian suffering from hunger, we'll have plenty of reason to feel shame. [Petra, in English] I also remember the fear, the disbelief that they would let him take office, and the hope that the country's dire injustices would finally be addressed. [Lula, in Portuguese] We're starting today a new chapter in Brazil's history. Not as a submissive nation, giving up its sovereignty; not as an unfair nation, passively watching the suffering of the poor; but as a proud, noble nation, bravely affirming itself in the world as a nation of all its people, with no distinction of class, ethnic background, sex or creed. Today is the day. Brazil encounters itself again. [audience cheers] [instrumental music playing] [Petra, in English] Watch how long it takes for him to cross this Congress. A sculptor whose material is human clay. These hugs reflect both his charisma and his decision to compromise. Elected with 61% of the votes, he still has a problem. His coalition has less than half of the seats in Congress. His party is soon caught in a corruption scandal called Mensalão, accused of buying votes to secure a majority. His chief of staff resigns, and, soon after, Lula's other possible successors also fall. Lula manages to distance himself from the scandal, but it would be a cloud that would follow him. He then resorts to a new alliance with the most powerful party in Congress, the PMDB. I voted for Lula with the hope that he would ethically reform the political system, and here he was, repeating practices that he had always criticized and forming alliances with Brazil's old oligarchy. [crowd chanting in Portuguese] Lula! Lula! Lula! [Petra, in English] But, at the same time, I was seeing 20 million people leaving poverty. The program the government created, Bolsa Família, provided around 30 dollars per month to each of Brazil's poorest families. [crowd clamors] [Petra] The number of Afro-Brazilians in university triples, unemployment rates reach the lowest number in history... and while the 2008 financial crisis spreads, Brazil rises from 13th to seventh-largest economy in the world. [indistinct chatter] [man, in Portuguese] The first thing he did was put food on the table of the poor worker, the small farmer... I have two daughters in college, thanks to government programs. The current government is prioritizing racist quotas against white people in our country. We've arrived at the end... We've arrived at the end of everything. He was a big letdown. He was of the working class and could've made this country way better. He did a good job at first... then got lost to the corruption that... rules this country. Today I have a home. My sister got her nursing degree, my daughter's doing nutrition. We needed the Bolsa Família program, and thanks to it, we've advanced. We're off the Bolsa now, but we got better because of it. I love this man from my heart. [Obama, in English] This is my man, right there. Love this guy! [indistinct chatter] The most popular politician on Earth. [interpreting in Portuguese] [Petra, in English] The discovery of one of the largest oil reserves in the world, which would be used to invest in social programs, was a blessing... [men shouting excitedly] -...that would soon turn into a curse. -[camera shutter clicking] [man, in Portuguese] And now we have the chance to talk with a special guest. The economist who started young, working first as Municipal Secretary, then as State Secretary, Minister of Energy, Chief of Staff... [Petra, in English] Here, Lula is presenting his anointed successor, Dilma Rousseff. [in Portuguese] I brought Dilma here so she can smile for you. [woman] Congratulations, Minister! Congratulations. [Petra, in English] Dilma was a former guerilla fighter imprisoned during the dictatorship. In this picture, she's being questioned after 22 days of torture. While her interrogators hide their faces, she sits up high. [Dilma, in Portuguese] The art of resisting torture lies in thinking, "It's just one more minute." If you think it'll be five or 20, it's too hard to bear. So you think, "One more minute, two..." and keep tricking yourself, on and on, trying to overcome what's inherently human, which is pain. There's already an 11% difference! DILMA ROUSSEFF ELECTED BRAZIL'S FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT They just announced that Dilma was elected president! [all exclaim] [woman 1] Our President! -[woman 2] Wait, our president's here! -[Lula] My president. She is great. [Dilma on TV] To all my Brazilian brothers and sisters... -Hey, President... -You invented this! You deserve this. [kisses] -[indistinct chatter] -[crowd cheering] [fireworks popping loudly] [crowd roars] [woman] Look! [whistles blowing] [energetic piano music playing] [Petra, in English] I was born in a world my parents wanted to transform. And I was becoming an adult in a world closer to what we had dreamt of. It felt like a change of symbols, of possibilities. [Petra, in Portuguese] Mom, how did you feel when she was elected or chosen? I felt... like I identified. More and more, as... she's a woman, from my state, a militant... We went to the same schools, but at different times. We were both imprisoned in the same jail. I, for a shorter time, of course. And mostly, she was there, for me, bearing the brunt of it all. [Dilma] It's okay, I managed to turn it on. [classical music playing on stereo] [indistinct chatter] [Dilma] You were arrested before. -Yes, before. -I was arrested later. -[Petra's mom] Then I went-- -You were arrested... -[Petra's mom] Around Ibiúna. -You were arrested in '68. -Because of the student Congress. -[Dilma] Was it '68? -Yes, in October. -[Dilma] Right. -I was arrested in January, in 1970. -[Petra's mom] January '70. [Petra, in English] One year after my first interview with Dilma, I took my mother to meet her... as they had much in common, but never met. [in Portuguese] Certain things, for me, are very difficult. What happens is that one can never... be completely anonymous again. There's a huge freedom in being anonymous. Immense. Which we had when we were in hiding. That's the thing. The immense feeling of freedom, which I never had again. -[Petra's mom] For a short time. -For a short time. Yes, but it's immense, isn't it? [Petra] When did you realize Lula was choosing you? [Dilma] No, I didn't want that! It's my... attachment... to freedom. But this was very well-known. [Petra] And he insisted on it? He doesn't speak. He does politics as a fait accompli. That's Lula. Today he talks more. Hey! [man] Hey, Mr. President, Mrs. Marisa. The last time we go out of the elevator. Saying bye to the palace and going home, to my apartment in São Bernardo do Campo. [Petra, in English] This is the last day of Lula and his first lady, Marisa, in power after serving two terms. [speaking indistinctly in Portuguese] Once a First Lady, always a First Lady. [Petra, in English] These images, and others that will come later, were shot by his official photographer, Ricardo Stuckert. [Lula, in Portuguese] I'll take a picture of you. [camera shutter clicking rapidly] [Petra, in English] He was leaving office with an 87% approval rating, one of the highest of any president in the world. [Ricardo, in Portuguese] Take one of yourself. [crowd cheering] [crowd chanting] Dilma! Dilma! Dilma! Dilma! Dilma! [Petra, in English] Today, looking back, I realize the excitement of having elected our first female president... blinded me to something else that is happening in this scene. The precipice that exists between Dilma and her tense vice president. [muffled cheering, footsteps echo] [Petra] Temer, on the right, has his gestures controlled as if he's moving inside a box. He interlocks his fingers and pulls his hands, as if he wanted to separate them. It was an arranged marriage. Since it was the first time Dilma had run for office, she depended even more than Lula on the alliance with the PMDB to be able to govern. The PMDB's condition was for Temer, a conservative politician and the leader of the party, to be vice president. When asked about the alliance, Lula answered, "If Jesus came to Brazil, he would have to make an alliance even with Judas." I wonder if anyone else imagined that this man, who had to go such a long way to be in the picture... five years later would want to be in the picture without her. [crowd continues cheering] [Petra] But this isn't just a story of betrayal. If the climate in the tropics was at the peak of optimism, in a few years, the foundations of democracy itself would begin to crack. My grandmother filmed these images of Brasília under construction. A decade before, my grandfather had started a construction company, but he didn't participate in the building of the city, fearing that the president would fall before it was finished. President Juscelino, who my mother, this little girl with the ponytail, saw briefly when he was governor of her state, dreamt Brasília as the capital of his vision of a modern Brazil. In the middle of the country, they drew a city that during the day would work happily, in an atmosphere of dignified monumentality. An utopic city that would house the dream of democracy. At its heart, the two houses of Congress. The lower house looking up, open to the desires of society, and the upper house closed in, meditating in deep thought. But the perfect architecture forgot a main ingredient of democracy: the people, who were ever more isolated from power. Far from public pressure, the political class perpetuated an age-old system of corruption that would become the cement that held everything together. [crowd clamoring] [Petra] And that system remained untouched, decade after decade until came the seismic shift. -[drums beating] -[crowd cheering] [crowd chanting in Portuguese] Power to the people! To make a new world! To make a new world! [Petra, in English] In the current of Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring what begins as a small demonstration against a rise in the bus fare, with a push of police repression and the help of the media and social networks, grows to become one of the largest demonstrations in the nation's history. As the streets suddenly awoke after 20 years, with a series of mixed demands, something in our social fabric started to change, giving birth to the deep division that would rip us apart. -[weapon blasting] -[man screams] [crowd shouting] [Petra] After ten years in power, the red flags of the Workers' Party no longer mobilize people's dreams. They start to become the target. [all chanting in Portuguese] The people, united! No political parties here! The people, united! No political parties here! The people, united! No political parties here! [chanting] Democracy! Democracy! [Petra, in English] From this moment on, nothing would be the same. [Petra] But before I go forward, I have to go back. Just before these protests, Dilma's popularity had reached such a high peak that she did a more radical move than Lula had ever dared to. She challenged the bankers reducing the interest rate. [in Portuguese] It's unacceptable that Brazil, with one of the most solid, profitable economic systems, has one of the highest interest rates in the world. The financial sector has no means of explaining this perverse logic. [Petra, in English] But contrary to her expectation, the economy starts to slow down and the protests have a damaging effect on the government. [in Portuguese] Research polls revealed that Dilma's popularity dropped by 27 points in these three weeks of protests. We truly need more efficient ways of fighting corruption. [Petra, in English] Trying to regain credibility for her government, Dilma fast-tracks a series of anti-corruption laws that allow a major investigation to erupt. A tsunami that would soon destabilize the political system. Operation Car Wash investigates Petrobras, the giant national oil company that is so strategically important that even the NSA made it a target for surveillance. Soon, investigators unveil a web of corruption tying together Petrobras, construction companies, and the main political parties. [in Portuguese] In each Petrobras contract with each of its big suppliers, and we're talking about billion-dollar contracts here, there was a fixed bribe of one to three percent. Hmm? And this didn't happen once or twice, it was systemic. [Petra, in English] The man behind the operation is a federal judge from the south of Brazil. Trained in the United States and inspired by an Italian corruption investigation, Sérgio Moro learns how to use the media in his favor. HE SAVED THE YEAR! [Petra] And a significant part of the media unquestioningly embraces his narrative. Since the operation keeps suspects in jail without trial until they denounce more important figures, Car Wash soon becomes Brazil's true-life crime thriller. [in Portuguese] It's not a turning point with state-run companies. It didn't start with Lula. -It's a tradition. -[man] So it has always-- It has always happened. It's like quicksand. Once in, it's almost impossible to get out. Slush funds became something nobody saw as a crime. A politician who says he didn't get slush funds is lying. [Petra, in English] Once the businessmen start talking, politicians of several parties begin to be arrested, including members of the Workers' Party. [door slams] [Petra] As the new election approaches, many blame Dilma for not interfering with the investigation. A move that would lead to her downfall. This is Aécio Neves, grandson of a president and Dilma's opposition candidate during the 2014 election. Our families have a link. His mother married my grandfather's cousin. Behind the scenes, a part of the construction companies and the PMDB switch their allegiance to Aécio in the belief that his interests were more aligned with their own. But Dilma wins by a narrow margin. It was the fourth time that his party had lost a presidential election to the Workers' Party. [speaking indistinctly] [Petra] And Aécio Neves does not accept the results. His party asks for an election audit, and when the results don't change, he starts defending Dilma's impeachment. [in Portuguese] We didn't lose the election to a political party. We lost it to a criminal organization that installed itself in the heart of the nation! But ready yourselves! Soon we won't be the opposition. We'll be the government! Let's do it! The PSDB's the future! Long live Brazil, long live the PSDB, victory is ours! [Petra, in English] I wonder if Aécio knew the dark forces he would be awakening by questioning the rules of the democratic game. [speaking indistinctly] ANNULMENT OF THE 2014 ELECTIONS IMPEACHMENT NOW LET'S TAKE TO THE STREETS ON THE 12TH FOR THE SAKE OF BRAZIL [Petra] Right-wing groups begin to travel amongst the social media algorithms, galvanizing the public's anti-corruption mood and transforming it into an insurrection against Dilma and Lula. BRAZIL WILL TAKE TO THE STREETS TO DEMAND IMPEACHMENT CHECK OUT EVENTS IN SÃO PAULO THIS SATURDAY: PROTEST ON PAULISTA [Petra] And the media does its part, normalizing the aggressive aspects of these protests as if they were a soccer game no one should miss. [in Portuguese] This is patriotism! [reporter] ...locked in a cell, there are people dressed as the ex-president. [Petra, in English] After a global drop in commodity prices and a series of economic mistakes, the country enters into recession. Dilma then breaks her campaign promises and implements an austerity program. Unemployment rises to eight percent, over four million Brazilians cross into poverty, and the government's approval rate drops to nine percent. THE END? [woman, in Portuguese] Fuck you, Dilma! [Petra, in English] And it is in this atmosphere that the Congress accepts the impeachment request against Dilma. [Dilma on TV, in Portuguese] Today I received with indignation the decision of the president of the Lower House... -[man] Fuck you, Dilma, you crook! -...to accept the impeachment request against a mandate democratically given to me by the Brazilian people. The reasons for this request are unfounded and inconsistent. I have not committed any illicit acts. There is no suspicion of fiscal wrongdoing around me. I have no offshore accounts. [Petra, in English] But one more piece was missing for the impeachment to take off. For the climax of Car Wash, Moro authorizes the police to detain Lula and force him to testify, even though the former president had never resisted questioning. Suspecting Lula was involved in the corruption scheme, investigators look for evidence: an apartment allegedly gifted to him by a construction company implicated in the Car Wash scandal. [crowd clamoring] [Petra] Although there's no formal accusation, the spectacle of Lula being taken by force by the police creates an impression of guilt. [in Portuguese] Take it easy! Take it easy! [crowd chanting] Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! [Petra, in English] The police raided his office, the house of his son and his home. [in Portuguese] So let me tell you, dear. I just met with Dilma, and I'll be the new chief of staff. Okay? Well, I'll take office... I'll take office... uh, next Tuesday. My nomination's today, but I take office on Tuesday. [crickets chirping] [on recording in Portuguese] [Lula] Uh-huh. [reporter 1] Today the crisis of Dilma's government reached its peak. [reporter 2] Confidentiality was lifted on the 24th phase of Car Wash investigations, and ex-President Lula's conversations were made public. [Petra, in English] For some, this audio leak was proof that Dilma was giving Lula his ministerial papers so he could avoid detention. For others, proof that Moro was using the law to take Lula out of the political game. [in Portuguese] A tapped phone call between President Dilma and Lula! Your Honor speaks highly of the USA. Imagine in the USA a Texas state judge recording a call between Bill Clinton and Obama, and releasing it at prime time a few hours later! You know the tapping was illegal as you gave the order to stop the wiretap at 11:12 a.m. The recording was at 1:32 p.m. By 6:00 p.m., it was on GloboNews. Can we accept that? Supreme Justice Minister Teori said the reasons given by Judge Moro were not enough to justify those special measures taken actually for abusive reasons. Uh, my decisions are open to criticism. There's no problem with that. It's freedom of speech. Uh, but I can't be accused of abuse of authority, as my decisions have been approved by the higher courts, unless you're also accusing them. [crowd chanting] Lula, it's no use crying! You're in Moro's hands! Lula, it's no use crying! [woman] I'm for Sérgio Moro, do you know why? Without Moro, Lula wouldn't be so close to going to jail. BYE, DEAR IN MORO WE TRUST That's what'll make Brazil change once and for all. And when will it change? First, impeachment. Then, prison. Then Brazil starts again. [crowd chanting] Lock Lula up! Lock Lula up! Lock Lula up! Lock Lula up! -[whistles blowing] -[crowd clamoring] [crowd chanting] Moro! Moro! Moro! Moro! [man 1 over megaphone] We demand the immediate ousting of the government, through the intervention of our armed forces. Fascists and Communists are the same shit! [man 2 over megaphone] Ironically, you bunch of deviants, it's the Military Police protecting you, you dumb shit! [all chanting] Out with PT! Out with PT! We're pro-freedom, and no one is taking away our right to say so. This is absurd! They're shooting themselves in the foot! [crowd clamoring] [Petra, in English] These were the first images I filmed. By deafness or blindness, it was my first contact with this unrest. It left me asking... what had shifted... so that a boy and a girl have to be removed from a protest just because they were wearing the color red? [crowd cheering] [Petra, in Portuguese] Why are you applauding? 'Cause he's been arrested. -[Petra] Who? -I don't know, someone from PT. -[Petra] Why was he arrested? -Huh? -[Petra] Why was he arrested? -'Cause he's fighting for something we don't want. [Petra, in English] From this point on, the country divided into two irreconcilable parts. [crowd chanting in Portuguese] There will be no coup! [Petra, in English] This is the other side. [in Portuguese] Fifty-four million votes! Respect that! There won't be a coup! Today I can pay for English classes for my kids. My mom couldn't afford to let me go to school! I can't read or write, but I can pay for my kids to study! [Lula] I don't want Aécio voters to like me. What I want is for us to learn how to live in a civilized way with our differences. Democracy is the only possibility we have of making a government where the people participate! [crowd chanting] Lula, warrior of the Brazilian people! Lula, warrior of the Brazilian people! I was moved, Dilma... I've been to many events, but the people were so happy today. I had to speak from both sides, first on one side of the truck, then the other. We need to do more rallies. It was wonderful. You can sleep soundly. Sleep well. [stammers] The sleep of the just. You're being the victim of an unprecedented sabotage. It's-- It's unprecedented. [news anchor] In a major turnaround today, the Supreme Court judge issued an injunction suspending the nomination of Lula as chief of staff. [reporter] The judge sees the intent by the former president to obstruct investigations against him in Operation Car Wash. [woman] The snakes that seized power... [man] Snake! ...are taking advantage of human weaknesses to perpetuate themselves. Do we want to serve a snake? [crowd] No! Brazil's not the snake republic! [crowd cheers] No! [Petra, in English] This woman on stage, Janaina Paschoal, is a lawyer and one of the authors of the impeachment request against Dilma. [in Portuguese] "Janaina, God doesn't give snakes wings." And I say to him, "Father, sometimes a snake grows wings. When that happens, God sends legions to cut the snake's wings!" [crowd cheers] Lula must be arrested, that dirty crook. The only one left. Against fiscal pedaling and Dilma's electoral maneuvers. She ruined Brazil, man! Nobody proved she stole. -Dilma was a mother to these guys. -Not to me. Dilma was a mother to all here, and they're trashing her. Military intervention is the medicine for this country. He's a lot older and recalls that in the time of the dictatorship things were a lot better. Generals, where are you? Military intervention is the remedy. Your relatives weren't killed during the dictatorship! -[man 1] Were yours? -I know people who lost friends! [man 1] They didn't. That's what they want you to believe. You have no idea what it was like! This government that wants to take over belongs to the elite, Globo TV, businessmen, bankers, landowners, Americans, who want the Amazon and Petrobras oil, rich Europeans... Brazilians had some chance. Dilma and PT left us the crumbs. Now we won't even have that. [Petra, in English It was the first time in more than 20 years that most of the country was paying attention to what was happening in Congress. Our destiny was being decided behind closed doors by 600 politicians I knew almost nothing about. [indistinct chatter] After this commission, the Lower House would vote on whether to approve the impeachment motion. Then, the final trial would take place in the Senate. [man 1, in Portuguese] ...it isn't about the so-called creative accounting decrees only. Unemployment, recession, cuts in social programs, inflation, rise in prices, loss of buying power... [Petra, in English] All I could hear was, on one side, how Dilma was responsible for all the country's problems, and, on the other, how her offense did not constitute an impeachable crime. [in Portuguese] What's wanted is impeachment. It matters little if I rip up the Constitution or violate democracy. I maintain that in a country historically marked, maybe since its discovery, by structural and systemic corruption, it's absurd... that a legitimately elected president be deposed for an accounting issue that's been accepted by the courts without her being accused in the process of stealing one cent. That's why this impeachment process shouldn't be called impeachment. If it does happen, it should be called a coup. The coup of April, 2016. [Petra, in English] At this moment, almost half of Brazil, including me, thought that Dilma was being impeached for corruption. After hours inside this commission, I understood that the actual accusation was that she had delayed the transfer of funds to public banks, in a kind of creative accounting to cover budget gaps. The debate was not whether the government had done it-- because it had, and to a higher degree than all governments before hers-- but whether this was a reasonable cause to impeach a president. [in Portuguese] I don't think impeachment should be an electoral tool. This seems to be the case here. An unfounded impeachment borders on a coup. Brazil is not a banana republic that can remove a president just because he's not popular. Those who regret their vote have to make up for it next time. That's the logic of politics. [Petra, in English] But nine months later, Eduardo Cunha would change his mind. The most powerful man in Congress, Cunha, allegedly helped finance the campaigns of dozens of congressmen, forming a type of private army that in turn elected him president of the Lower House. He was investigated for hiding millions of dollars in bribes in a Swiss bank, Feeling targeted, he had decided to break with the government. [in Portuguese] The government doesn't swallow me. It has a personal hatred of me. I'll ask in the PMDB assembly that they break with the government. That they leave the government. And I, as of now, am breaking with the government. [Petra, in English] Then, he asks Dilma and the Workers' Party to help save his mandate in Congress. After weeks of debate, they refuse. And, in retaliation, he immediately opens impeachment proceedings against Dilma. [Petra, in Portuguese] Many got disappointed with PT after its alliance with PMDB. Especially after Cunha enters the game. Do you regret that? As for the disappointment: to govern, you need a majority in Congress. Those disappointed must ask, "Why didn't we elect our congressmen? Leaving it so that, for a two-thirds majority in Congress, 20 parties were needed." Our mistake was not realizing that right-wing supremacy was growing. The right-wing wasn't so strong on my re-election in 2014, when we made the alliance with PMDB. When does it assert itself? When Cunha-- Because he's the boss, not Temer. When Cunha gets elected president of the Lower House. He arranges the whole structure, he sets up the coup, he sets up the siege. I have to tell you, I didn't govern in 2015. [indistinct chatter] [Petra] In your opinion, what were Dilma's greatest mistakes? She never bonded. There are congressmen from PT who claim-- Just yesterday I met with left-wing congressmen. They said Dilma never gave them a hug, never shook their hands. [Petra] So, Dilma's being removed because she didn't give enough hugs? -No, not hugs. -[Petra] In a way. For her coldness, her political ineptness. Yeah. I can also say that Dilma was honest. But a good cook is not one who cooks to her own taste. She cooks to please those who will be eating. She doesn't treat people well, but this is secondary. If the economy was doing well, this wouldn't matter. [Petra] So, the main reason is the economy? Of course! She fought with Congress, the Judiciary, the Treasury. She fought with the market, she fought with her voters. [Petra] When do you think the fall of Dilma's government starts? [man 1] In 2013, Dilma spoke on Labor Day, saying that the rich, the bankers would have to pay for the crisis. She poked the bear with a short stick. The elites then started to hammer away at Dilma's popularity. The economic indicators began changing. I haven't spoken to him since, so I don't know. We'll release a statement so-- [man 2] This is Petra, she's making a documentary-- [Aécio kisses] [Petra] Would you give us an interview? We'll make an appointment, okay? [Petra, in English] Unfortunately, Aécio never gave me this interview. [sighs] [in Portuguese] Hello, my man. Yesterday, I met with congressmen all day long. Things are really bad. Very bad. Bad for the impeachment commission, bad for the Lower House vote. You know? It's not bad with the enemies. It's bad with the allies. Did she or didn't she? Was she doing budget maneuvers or not? Is it a crime or isn't it? You know? So, I said, look, our economists will forever defend her, and theirs will attack her. Her lawyers will defend her, and the prosecutors will accuse her. One senator attacking, and the other-- Why don't they create an international commission with specialists in public funds and ask for an official report? Because this is like religion. It's endless. Dilma will die saying she didn't commit crimes, and Aécio will die saying she did. [indistinct chatter] [screeches] The pro-impeachment protesters will be on this side, and the-- Over there. And the anti-impeachment protesters on that side. The right-wing will be on the right side and the left-wing on the left? Uh, I wouldn't-- I wouldn't put it that way. It depends on the point of reference. [piano music playing] [Petra, in English] My whole family would be on the right side of this wall... were it not for a small mutation that happened in 1964. The government had just declared that it would redistribute the land to the people. [crowd cheering] [Petra] My mother's family entered into despair and prepared their boxes to move to California to escape the Communist threat. But to their relief, the military took power backed by the United States and celebrated by the media. Weeks later, my father left to the United States with a one-way ticket. The protests against the Vietnam War were the first spark to awaken him. Then, a small bookstore in the Village, filled with books of Marx and Erich Fromm... Two years later, he comes back, and my mother falls in love with him at first sight. First with him, and then with the revolution. And that coup that was supposed to last one year ended up lasting 20. I don't know how this should be told. The fact is that, during the years that my parents were in hiding, when their friends were being tortured and killed, were the years that the construction company my grandfather co-founded... most grew. [engine sputtering] [metal scraping] [Petra] I see that the story of this crisis, of this wall, runs directly through my family. On one side it's the story of the establishment that my grandparents were part of. On the other, it's the story of my parents and the left they dreamt of, and which is crumbling. But it's also the story of a broken country that we're inheriting. [crowd 1 chanting in Portuguese] Impeachment! Impeachment! Impeachment! Impeachment! Impeachment! Impeachment! [man 1] Bye, dear!

I vote yes! [crowd cheers] For all my family... -For my family. -[congressman 3] ...for my family. I'd like to thank my aunt, who took care of me when I was little. For evangelicals from all over the nation! For God's people, I vote yes. [crowd cheers] Considering that our president didn't commit any crimes, unlike most here under investigation, who shame this house... In the name of those who hunger for justice... I'm embarrassed to participate in this hoax, this indirect election conducted by a thief, urged by a traitor and conspirator, supported by torturers, cowards, political illiterates, and sell-outs. This sexist hoax. I vote no to the coup, and sleep on it, you bastards! [man on TV] Congressman Eduardo Cunha, how do you vote? [Cunha] May God have mercy on this nation. I vote yes. [audience cheers] A show trial was established! With an inquisitor at its head, Eduardo Cunha. You're a gangster. -I vote no! -[man 2] Congressman Glauber Braga... Dilma! You're an embarrassment! Embarrassment! Embarrassment! Yes! [crowd cheering] What an honor destiny reserved for me to use my voice as a cry of hope for millions of Brazilians. That's why I say to Brazil, "Yes to the future!" [Cunha] Voted yes: 367 congressmen. The proceedings against the president are now authorized for crimes of responsibility. -[crowd cheering] -[whistles blowing] [indistinct chatter] [reporter] Many representatives are leaving in tears. -[man 1] Good job, Mr. President. -[woman 1] Congratulations, Cunha! [group chanting] Goodbye, PT! Goodbye, PT! Goodbye, PT! Goodbye, PT! [all cheering] [Petra] How did you watch the Lower House vote? -[Dilma] Calmly. -[José] Calmly. -[Petra] In the presidential residence? -[José] Yes... the Alvorada. -Calm on the outside. -[José] On the outside. [Dilma] With great indignation. How can we appear like this to the world? What will they think of us? I-- I felt ashamed. -[José] And the worst-- -I felt both things. [José] The worst were the congressmen coming to the presidential residence that morning saying, "Count on me to turn this around!" -[Dilma] That's the part of the betrayal-- -It's deplorable. -It's deplorable. -[Petra] Who did this? -[Dilma] Oh, my... -[José] We... [laughs] [Dilma] This process is Kafkaesque in the sense of The Castle. -[Petra] The Trial. -Right, Kafka's The Trial. -[José] It's Josef K. -Right? [Petra] So, you felt like Josef K? But I'm Josef K in person! [José laughing] And I'm Josef K's lawyer. And I'm lucky, because Josef K didn't have a lawyer. [José] He didn't, poor guy. He was alone. I at least have this luck, of being Josef K with a lawyer! [gentle piano music playing] [Petra, in English] For me, the face of Brazil changed the night of this vote. My face. The face of this Congress. [crowd clamoring] [Petra] This is Jair Messias Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who had just declared he would run for president. [Bolsonaro, in Portuguese] They lost in 1964. They lost now, in 2016. Against Communism... [Petra, in English] Exalting the dictatorship's most infamous torturer and assassin. [in Portuguese] In memory of Colonel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, Dilma Rousseff's greatest terror! [Bolsonaro] I have plans for 2018. -I'm taking it seriously. Yes. -[reporter] Presidential elections? I have eight percent in the polls. If Datafolha gives me eight percent, I must have 24%. Agribusiness loves me when I say, "You farm guys will have your rifles." The welcoming card for the Landless Movement is a loaded gun. If you'd like a gun at home, you'll have it! That's how violence is fought! The language that bums understand is violence. They call me rude, homophobic, fascist, etc... I'm a hero. I get stronger every day in the public opinion. If you want, come on in. I'm just changing my clothes. Okay? This is my office. These are... our last presidents. Castelo Branco, Costa e Silva, Médici-- who ended the Araguaia guerrilla... or we'd have a FARC in the center of Brazil. Geisel... Who the left hates, right? 'Cause criminals then got what they deserved. [Petra, in English] A part of my family decided to vote for him. In Bolsonaro's cosmology, militants like my parents should have been killed. [crowd clamoring] [Petra] It was the face of a country that had never punished the crimes committed under military rule. A country that had been shaped by slavery, privilege, and coups. [indistinct shouting] [weapons fire] [Petra] Our democracy was founded on forgetting. -[weapons fire] -[people scream] [smoke bomb explodes] [man 1, in Portuguese] Well done! Well done, you! Hey! My stuff! [indistinct shouting] -[man 1] Get your hands off of him! -[man 2] He didn't do anything! -[man 2] Leave him alone! -[man 1] Well done, you! Well done, you! [indistinct shouting] [indistinct chatter] [Petra, in English] After the Lower House vote, the Senate suspends Dilma for 112 days until her final trial. -Temer takes office as interim president. -[audience applauds] As he substitutes the first female president, he names a cabinet of all white males. [man 1, in Portuguese] God save the president! -[man 2] Hey, braggart! -[man 3] There's your spotlight. [man 3] You got your screen time. What we want to do with Brazil is a religious act. An act of reconnecting all of Brazilian society... [audience cheers] ...with the fundamental values of our country. [crowd cheering] [indistinct chatter] [Petra, in English] This night, the rules of the palace were suspended. It was a feast. The fauna of the plateau changed radically in a few hours. Temer's arrival filled the corridors with right-wing conservatives of the Congress, defenders of the Bible, the bullet, and the bull. [man 5, in Portuguese] Not now. Not now. [Petra, in English] These men seized the saloon with thirst after years of having to ask for permission to enter. -[indistinct chatter] -[incidental opera music playing] [Petra] Of course, there were also those who never left. At a party in Bandeirantes Palace, a politician asked the owner of a company, "What are you doing here?" And the owner answered, "I'm always here. You politicians are the ones who change." After a few hours filming in the Alvorada, as I walk out the door, I find two plaques, placed on each side of the palace. On one side, a plaque placed during the term of Fernando Collor de Mello, a right-wing president, saying that this palace was renovated thanks to the generosity of these companies. And on the other, a plaque placed during the term of Lula, a left-wing president. Andrade Gutierrez is the name of the company my grandfather cofounded in 1947. In 2015, the president and several executives of the company went to prison, as well as from most major construction companies. The influence of money in politics was the secret that all knew and none addressed, until Car Wash came. It was painful to see a party we elected on the promise of transforming the system become more and more cemented within a structure of campaign financing designed to make change almost impossible. [Petra, in Portuguese] Mom, how did you feel when they began to reveal the corruption schemes between the government and construction companies? Corruption schemes between the government and companies is the common rule in the history of Brazil. What's new is... Car Wash, that imprisons and strikes plea bargains with politicians and businessmen, including executives linked to my family. This was the great novelty. It never happened before in this country. I even thought it could be effective. But it started getting highly partisan. Above all, it started looking like a strategy of the elite to eliminate the threat of the left. Take out Lula, overthrow Dilma, do away with PT. Even if... at the cost of sacrificing a part of the elite-- the contractors. So, cut off that arm and preserve the rest. [man] The Workers' Party was born contesting all this vertical, bureaucratic, corrupt form of doing politics-- As it kept growing and dealing with power, it lost something, Petra, very important to us. That is, "One foot out, one foot in." The foot on the outside keeps connected to the social struggles, knowing that, in capitalism, you only get your rights by mobilizing and fighting. The inside foot is being inside the institution, seeking to change it. But we grew, and the outside foot was slowly forgotten. We started depending too much on governing through Congress. We thought we'd be friends with the big fish, effortlessly. Uh, that the campaign financing was a natural thing. We didn't make the political reform necessary to end the curse of business campaign financing. There lies the mother of corruption. The candidate needs money, the company funds him and asks for favors when he's elected. He thinks, "If I don't do as they say, I won't have money for the next campaign." The party started doing what the others did. Forgetting that the treatment by these "houses of justice" would be totally different for us in relation to them. [gentle instrumental music playing] [Petra, in English] After only 11 days of Temer's interim government, an unknown party leaks new audio shedding light on what had been going on in the shadows of the Republic. In the conversation, recorded weeks before the first impeachment vote, Temer's right-hand man, Romero Jucá, was recorded discussing Operation Car Wash with a former oil executive. [on recording in Portuguese] [Petra, in English] Again. [on recording in Portuguese] [reporter 1] It's a bomb exploding in the second week of Temer's government... [reporter 2] The conversations happened a few weeks before the vote in which the Lower House opened an impeachment process against President Dilma. [reporter 3, in English] In the conversation, the men agree that ousting President Rousseff would be the only way to end the corruption probe against them. [dramatic violin music playing] [crowd clamoring] [Petra] With the motivation of the impeachment exposed, I thought the process could fall apart. [crowd chanting in Portuguese] Coup plotter! -[man 1] Crook! -[man 2] You belong in jail! -[glass squeaking] -[indistinct chatter] [man 3] If Temer does take office by the Senate's decision, his government will better, not worsen, people's lives. [interviewer 1] How was your meeting with Vice President Temer this morning? We had another conversation. The president spoke in further detail of his plans for a state reform, shutting down ministries... [reporter, in English] Well, the most questionable element in this whole process is whether or not this impeachment procedure is being conducted in the interest of the country, since more than half of the members of both houses of Congress are either under investigation or have been charged for crimes that include fraud, slavery, and even homicide. -[camera shutters clicking] -[orchestra music playing] [reporter 2] It's being called D-Day for Dilma Rousseff. This is going to be the first time the suspended president comes face-to-face with her accusers to defend herself... [crowd clamoring] [in Portuguese] To what extent do you and your government feel sincerely responsible for this recession, for the 12 million unemployed, the 60 million people in debt, and the five percent loss in income of the Brazilian workers? If one of your arguments to justify the pedaling, or the fiscal accounting fraud, is the drop in revenues, that too is prohibited in our country. [man 1] By your own decision, when hiding data, numbers, facts, you covered up a terrible reality. Until the day when truth surfaced. [man 2] The budget maneuvering was done not out of love for the poor, the assistance programs, nor love for the Bolsa Família program. It was to cover up the damage to the national bank. I apologize because, even though I didn't intend to, I caused her suffering. And I ask her to... [indistinct chatter] [crying] ...one day... understand that I did this thinking also of her grandchildren. I'm here to look directly in the eyes of Your Excellencies, and to say with the serenity of those with nothing to hide, I haven't committed the crimes I'm unfairly and arbitrarily accused of. It's not legitimate, as my accusers would like, to remove a chief of government because they don't agree with their body of work. The ones to do so are the people, and only the people, at the polls. Now, the Constitution is invoked so the world of appearances hypocritically conceals the world of facts. We will all be judged by history. Twice, I saw up close the face of death, when I was tortured... When I was tortured for successive days, subjected to abuse that made us doubt humanity and the very meaning of life. And when a serious, extremely painful illness could've shortened my life. Today, I fear only the death of democracy. [solemn piano music playing] [woman] Hey! Hold on a second, honey. These boxes... [Petra] Did you expect this to happen? Well, the way things were going, yes, we did. Things... I think there's still a lot more to come out. A lot more dirt. It would be easy if all that's happened could be cleaned with a cloth and a bucket of water. But unfortunately, there's no way. So many filthy things. These things always happen in politics. If you ask me... she must have deserved it or the whole population wouldn't be thinking this way. But I don't think anyone's clean. The people chose her. I think new elections would be the best thing. I'm not sure she was taken out by the people. It wasn't democratic, or a choice by voters. Actually, there is no democracy. I don't think so. Our right to vote-- I don't think it exists. [Petra, in English] After the impeachment, all eyes turn to the next presidential election. Lula declares he will run for president again. [Petra, in Portuguese] Do you have any regrets? [Lula] I regret a lot of things, my dear. But my greatest regret is not having done more. Not having presented to Congress when I was president the new media regulations. Nine families run the entire media in Brazil. And we have centuries of prejudice, you know? Centuries of domination, from the plantation masters and slaves being so mistreated. To change... all that... is very tough. If-- And it doesn't always work. But when there's a revolution, half die in battle, half run away, and then you think you can do it all. In many countries, this was possible. But to do it the way we did, with democracy, freedom of the press, with the right to strike, the right to protest, with Congress working freely? That's much harder, but it's also more rewarding. Because... we learn... what the values of democracy are. [man] Getting to the top of the hierarchy of the criminal organization, today the Prosecutor's Office accuses Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of being the mastermind of the corruption scheme identified in Car Wash. [Petra, in English] And only two weeks after the impeachment, prosecutors present their accusation live, to the main media networks, with 14 points that include that as President Lula had had the power to make decisions and that he was close to several people convicted in Car Wash. The actual accusation, though, filed after two years of investigation, was that Lula had received an apartment from a construction company. [in Portuguese] We don't have clear proof of Lula's legal ownership of the apartment. The fact that he doesn't appear as the owner of the Guarujá triplex apartment is a way of hiding the actual ownership. And, in the same way... [Petra, in English] The fact that there is no evidence that he's the owner of the apartment is considered proof of his attempt to hide it, and this proof is then used as evidence that he's the mastermind of the scheme. The signs that Lula received special favors from contractors were troubling. I wish the investigation had convinced me whether he was guilty or innocent, but instead, I was seeing prosecutors making a spectacle to present their case. [indistinct chatter] [Petra] Lula's wife, Marisa, is also indicted in the accusation about the apartment. Four months later, she suffers a stroke and dies. [crowd singing in Portuguese] ♪ Hold to God's unchanging hand and go ♪ ♪ Hold to God's unchanging hand and go ♪ ♪ Hold to God's unchanging hand ♪ ♪ Hold to God's unchanging hand ♪ ♪ He shall guide you out of the dark ♪ [reporter on radio] The former president has his last chance to defend himself in the case of the Guarujá triplex apartment. [reporter 2] For the first time since Car Wash began, Sérgio Moro and Lula will meet face-to-face. [news anchor] It's improper that the deposition of a defendant to a federal judge within legal proceedings be transformed into this carnival. "The confrontation of the century." -[police sirens wailing] -[helicopter blades whirring] FIRST FACE-TO-FACE MEETING MORO VS. LULA [Moro] Did you ever visit the triplex apartment 164-A of the Solaris Condominium? Yes, in 2014. -How many times did you go there? -Once. I saw 500 flaws in it, and never again did I talk to Leo about the apartment. Did you or your wife request any sort of renovation for this apartment? -No. -No? As I consider this lawsuit illegitimate... -[Moro] Mm-hmm. -...and the accusation a farce, I'm-- I'm-- I'm here out of respect for the law -and our Constitution, -[Moro] Mm-hmm. but with many reservations regarding the Car Wash prosecutors. I see. But this is your opportunity to defend yourself and clarify these matters, right? Some directors of contractors admitted there was a criminal scheme within Petrobras to pay a bribe for large contracts. You had no knowledge of any of the crimes committed -by the directors of Petrobras? -No. [Moro] Mr. Ex-President... you say you were not responsible and had no knowledge. Uh... could there have been any slips? What do you think happened in this case? -Dr. Moro, do you feel responsible... -[Moro] Hmm? ...for the destruction of Brazil's civil construction industry by Car Wash? I'm sure you don't. Do you find that what's harmed these companies -is corruption, or the fight against it? -No. The method of fighting corruption. I'm being judged because of a PowerPoint built on lies. I'd expect that in a hearing such as this, the Prosecutor's Office would present... [stammers] ...the property deed. "Lula says it's not his, but here's the legal document. He paid for it. There's thedeed." What I want is for the innuendos to stop and that I be told what crime I've committed! Prison for the thief! Jail! [crowd clamoring] [Petra, in English] Two months later, Moro sentences Lula to nine and a half years in prison. [in Portuguese] Robber of Petrobras! He should die in prison! Long live Moro! [Petra, in English] His case reaches the court of appeals at a faster speed than any other process of Car Wash. And there, his sentence is increased to 12 years. TRIAL DECIDES LULA'S FUTURE TODAY PREVENT LULA'S ARREST DEFEAT THE COUP [crowd clamoring] [man, in English] I'm afraid I have to say that Brazil has a primitive system based on the Spanish Inquisition that was taken into Portugal and was-- Then, in the 19th century, you inherited it. I don't think the case against Lula would get off the ground in England or Europe, and the extraordinary thing about Brazil's legal system is that your prosecutors are judges. An investigating judge, like Judge Moro, who targets the suspect, orders... their telephones to be tapped, their houses to be searched. And then... he charges them and turns into the trial judge. The most important right of a defendant is the right to an impartial judge. -[crickets chirping] -[birds singing] [calming flute music playing] [Petra, in English] Behind the curtain of public appearances, audio leaks kept reminding me of a story more reminiscent of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. If the first leak echoed the conspiracy of the senators to stab Caesar because he had become too powerful... the second reminded me of the final act of the play, when Brutus cannot sleep, haunted by Caesar's ghost. At midnight, speaking to the owner of the world's largest meat company, Temer confesses that he cannot live in the palace. [on recording in Portuguese] [Petra, in English] But the conversation reveals more than just Temer's superstition. He's allegedly heard encouraging hush money payments to buy Cunha's silence. [on recording in Portuguese] [indistinct chatter] [Petra, in English] Cunha's silence was in Temer's close interest considering that, a few months earlier, Cunha had been sentenced to 15 years in jail for corruption and could sign a plea bargain denouncing Temer. But in the end, he didn't. -[speaking indistinctly] -[camera shutters clicking] [Petra] Temer was also accused of asking Joesley for another favor. In these images, we see Temer's close aide carrying a suitcase with what investigators believe was the first payment of $150,000 that would be paid weekly to Temer, totaling $12 million. [woman speaking indistinctly] [Petra] Aécio was also recorded, allegedly arranging who would pick up his payment of $625,000. [on recording in Portuguese] [Petra, in English] Again. [on recording in Portuguese] [Petra, in English] Thanks to his parliamentary immunity and a little help from his fellow senators, Aécio preserves his mandate and his freedom. [crowd clamoring] [Petra] And one year after Dilma's impeachment, the same Congress that was so vocal against corruption suddenly changed its tone when voting whether Temer should be investigated. [man, in Portuguese] We've come to the decisive moment when each of us will vote before the Brazilian people. May the voting begin. An investigation is needed, but it's not urgent! Not that this is to be an ode to criminality. A country which looks to the future doesn't change presidents like it changes clothes. Putting an interim government inside a provisional government... is not good for Brazil at this moment. It's not good for Brazil to keep shifting presidents. I vote yes to archive. [man 2] Result. For: 263. Against: 227. The matter will be archived, and the decision not to authorize an investigation of President Temer will be communicated to the Supreme Court. [Petra, in English] Fragile democracies have one advantage over solid ones: they know when they're over. Generals close the Congress, occupy the TV stations, and everyone knows what happened. But democracies can also end slowly. They say this vote cost $1.3 billion in amendments, so that congressmen would shield the president from prosecution. The fact that 80% of the population wanted Temer to be investigated didn't bother the politicians; neither the stock markets that celebrated the results. Temer was delivering almost all they had asked for. Auctioning the country's oil reserves to foreign companies, weakening laws that prohibited slave labor, and approving austerity measures that would brutally hurt the poor. One can have different opinions on legal issues. What seems wrong to me is for one side of the political dispute to have the power to turn the institutions on and off according to their own interests. A blatant exercise of power that gave me the nauseous feeling that our democracy was very sick. [crowd chanting in Portuguese] Coupists! Fascists! You shall not pass! Coupists! Fascists! You shall not pass! Out with Temer! Out with Temer! Out with Temer! Out with Temer! Out with Temer! [woman over megaphone] Military police! We need to stop the repression! This car needs to move! [crowd chanting] Who said it's normal, Americans taking over our oil? [sirens wailing in distance] [crowd clamoring] -[gunfire] -[smoke bombs whoosh] [sirens blaring] [piercing orchestra music playing] [indistinct chatter] [Petra, in English] Six months before the election, Lula leads with 31% of vote intentions, followed by Bolsonaro with 15. [in Portuguese] A good Workers' Party person is one without a mandate, no political office... Is one living in Cuba. The army is who guarantees our democracy, and we've always had the army for democracy and freedom. [Petra, in English] In the public opinion, Bolsonaro seems little by little to seize the space occupied by Moro as the new redeemer. And despite his anti-democratic statements, a significant part of the elite starts to think of him as the best alternative to defend the interests of the market. On April 4th, the Supreme Court meets to come to a final decision on whether Lula is allowed to remain free until he exhausts his appeals. [inaudible] [Petra] At 1:00 a.m., by six votes to five, Lula's appeal is denied. And the next day, Judge Moro issues an order for Lula to turn himself into prison within 24 hours. [crowd clamoring] [woman 1, in Portuguese] You're gonna meet the president. -[man 1] Guys, hey! -[man 2] You got your picture, let's go. [woman 2] Could you take my picture? [reporter, in English] The Supreme Court's rejection of Lula's bid to stay out of jail while he appeals effectively removes him from Brazil's presidential election later this year, where he was the front-runner. [indistinct chatter] [reporter 2, in Portuguese] Many people are arguing for him not to turn himself in. It was too quick, Marlene, come on! What about this battery of lawyers? It shouldn't have been that quick. Lawyers can't do much about it. Okay? I knew... the coup wouldn't end until they'd arrested me. Because Dilma's impeachment was a way of getting to me. It made no sense to impeach Dilma... and let me come back four years later. I'm practically under house arrest here, because I can't leave. The union is my guarantee that they won't arrest me. So I'm... destined to spend the night on the floor. [Petra chuckles] [reporter] The deadline established by Moro for Lula to turn himself in to serve prison time for the triplex apartment charges has ended. [Petra, in English] As I went home, I heard fireworks celebrating Lula's imminent arrest. They made me think of a quote. "There's class warfare all right," said Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world. "But it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning." [indistinct chatter] [in Portuguese] It's a little high, Mr. President, 146 over 90. Funny, I usually don't have blood pressure above 13. [men shouting] Lula! Lula! [crowd chanting] Lula, warrior of the Brazilian people! Lula, warrior of the Brazilian people! Lula, warrior of the Brazilian people! NO TO LULA'S ARREST NO TO THE COUP [crowd chanting] Here are the people, not afraid to fight! Here are the people, not afraid to fight! Here are the people, not afraid to fight! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! [Lula] We now have a delicate job to do. They... ordered my arrest. And let me tell you something: -I'm going to obey this order of theirs. -[crowd] No! I'm going to do so because I want to transfer responsibility. They think everything that's going on in this country is because of me. If I didn't believe in justice, I wouldn't have founded a political party. I would've proposed a revolution in this country. But I believe in justice! A fair justice system, where verdicts are based on the evidence presented. It's no use trying to stop me from traveling around this country, because there are millions of Lulas, Boulos, Manuelas, and Dilma Rousseffs to do it for me. There's no use in trying to stop my ideas. They're already in the air, and you can't imprison them! There's no point in trying to stop my dreams, because when I stop dreaming, I'll be dreaming through your minds and dreams! There's no point in thinking everything's going to stop the day Lula has a heart attack. That's nonsense! Because my heart will be beating through yours, and there are millions of hearts! The powerful can kill one, two, or 100 roses. But they'll never stop the arrival of spring, and our fight is in search of spring!

Don't let them jail him! [crowd clamoring] [chanting] Circle in, circle in! Don't let them jail him! Circle in, circle in! Don't let them jail him! Circle in, circle in! Don't let them jail him! Circle in, circle in! Don't let them jail him! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! Don't turn yourself in! [reporter 1] ...the result of the last 48 hours of negotiations between Lula's representatives and the Federal Police... When all seemed settled, his supporters prevented him from leaving. [reporter 2] Protesters have occupied all possible exits. [reporter 1] Lula left the union, but instead of getting in the car, he's coming out walking. [crowd shouting] Let's calm down, all right? [indistinct chatter] -[man 1] Mr. President! -[man 2] Mr. President! [Lula] Bye-bye, dear. [man 3] We're right behind you in the motorcade with the guys. Mr. President, let me give you a kiss. -[stammers] Where's Cris? -[man 4] Zanin. Cristiano Zanin will be with him. The lawyer. [man 5] Goodbye, Mr. President. [helicopter blades whirring overhead] [man 6] Careful there. [police sirens wailing] [man shouting] [crowd clamoring] FORMER PRESIDENT LULA IS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY TO CURITIBA -[people shouting] -[whistle blowing] [man 1 whoops] [man 2] It's fucking Bolsonaro! [somber piano music playing] [Bolsonaro over radio] The red criminals... [crowd cheers] ...will be banned from our country. #BOLSOLEGEND YOU'D BETTER GET USED TO JAIR! [horns honking] [Bolsonaro] We're the majority. Together, we'll build a new nation. DIE HARD BOLSONARO LEGEND [somber piano music continues playing] [Petra, in English] A Greek writer said that democracy is only working when the rich feel threatened. Otherwise, oligarchy takes over. From father to son, from son to grandson, from grandson to great-grandson, and so successively. We are a republic of families. Some control the media, others control the banks. They own the sand, the rock, the iron. And all so often, it happens that they get tired of democracy, of its rule of law. How do we deal with the pain of being thrown into a future that looks as bleak as our darkest past? What do we do when the mask of civility falls and what appears is an ever more haunting image of ourselves? Where do we gather the strength to walk through the ruins and start anew?
