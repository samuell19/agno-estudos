Two zebras, at the marigot's edge, are looking at a zebra herd drinking. "You know", says one of them, "we are not like the other creatures." Who are we? There are a thousand ways to feel like an outlaw. And 999 of them don't bother anybody anymore. The pillar of our society is stronger than ever. The most radical way of questioning our common laws, our morale, the accepted social order, is the one that takes roots in the night of the bodies. The sex of the angels Will Narcissus live? Will he be happy? He doesn't know himself. Narcissus is not God. For a long time, the words of the divine prophet sounded senseless. Then Narcissus grew older. Like Apollo, he was incredibly beautiful. Many young girls were looking for him. But his innocence and is purity, he seemed to never realize the damages his supreme beauty was causing. This was an ancient time, the mirror that may have punished him did not exist yet. I am told I am beautiful. The most beautiful of the mortals. The most beautiful of the mortals can only love himself. This is my misery. This is my misery. When I try to hug myself, I cloud my image. I'd like to separate me from my own love but it is out of my power. I can't resolve to deny myself. My pain is taking all my strengths away. I am reduced to an endless despair. I have to give up on life. I wish I could die. Farewell, fatal mirror. I'm in love my myself. I cannot be happy, as people foretold me. Here I am, breathing my last breath. Farewell, vain love. The morale of this story is simple. Narcissus loves his own kind. So he's an homosexual. He cannot be happy. It can only kill him. He's like a flower in a hothouse. Mythical tale from an educational book. A. Like Apollo. Apollo, God of music, poetry and arts, is represented as a young beardless man. Perfectly beautiful, crowned with bay leaves and holding a lyre. He became intimate with Hyacinth. But one day, as they were playing in the palace, he willingly killed him. Sorry about that incident, Apollo metamorphosed his friend into a flower, which also took the name of hyacinth. Hyacinth left. He ran away from a country filled with bitter memories. He worked on the building of Troy's walls. Apollo pretended to be the inventor of music and poetry. He fought a musical battle against the satyr Marsyas, a skillful flute player bankrolled by Pluto. It was agreed that the loser would be at the service of his opponent. Yes. The god won and used his advantage in a barbaric way. He ordered Marsyas to be...

Look at the images the society wants us to carry on. Touch your flute, not your pee-pee. Sing songs and dance in circle. Hold hands, nothing more. Don't kiss whoever you want to. We are dreaming of caresses, kisses. Our bodies are firm and hard. Our torsos are gracious. Adults find us pretty. So they lock us up in their families, their schools, their museums... They fertilize us with their principles, their morale, their education. We are all born, then we are separated in boys and girls. Future Moms, future Dads. Mom is weak, as we know. Dad is strong, virile and owns a house. I yearn for nudity. I refuse the role I'm being given as a guy. I don't care about super-virility. I want to follow my own body. Not you directions, your interdictions, your arrow-marked paths. I don't give a fuck about your posing pouches. We'll stop listening to adults talking about our sexuality. We'll create our own, for our own happiness. Because we are tired of your interpretation of sins, duties, cleanness, dirt, family, sacrifice, penitence... It bores us and give us acne. We are strangled by your ties. They are made of idiocy, frustration and ugliness.

Thus, the chain of exploited persons is fulfilled. Morale and censorship support a society that hold people down with codes, grids, labels and ghettos. Our society has precise ideas on each type of people. It categorizes them. A young minor girl must be kind, clean and sweet. A boy must be kind, clean and sweet. But not too much, it would be feminine. The young girl must get ready to become a woman, which is a docile wife. A man must be strong, virile and earn a good salary. The main goal of this education is for the man and the woman to marry. So as to have many children, boys and girls, who will do the same. May those who don't want to do so hide in the public urinals they use to occupy. Because they know, these horrible monsters, that a penis, in its medical term, is not only used to piss or make kids. Fags, this year, are virilizing. They are wearing leather and mustaches. This makes the labels on the boxes irrelevant. We don't know anymore who is one and who isn't. This phenomenon needs to be corrected. So we let cops infiltrate them, fuck them and denounce them. We should put some in the crowds, they worry the institutions too. We don't know who's who anymore. When you put an animal in a box you can easily find him, thanks to its registration number. Also it is a great spectacle, very funny. Because everybody needs to know there is only one sexuality. Only this one will be accepted as valuable, profitable and hygienic. As for the others, there is dissimulation, prohibition, darkness and nights. ...is dissimulation, prohibition, darkness, nights and dreams. 1 rook = 1 kiss, 1 bishop = 1 handjob, 1 knight = 1 blowjob, 1 queen = 1 69 1 king = FUCKmate ♪ Mister Schoolteacher ♪ ♪ do you remember me? ♪ ♪ A little boy who, I think, ♪ ♪ was not always very kind. ♪ ♪ A little boy who has grown a lot. ♪ ♪ And who often thinks now ♪ ♪ "This was a good time!" ♪ ♪ Mister Schoolteacher, ♪ ♪ I can remember you ♪ ♪ "Geese, teeth, feet, ♪ ♪ children, mice, oxen!" ♪ ♪ And all the others! ♪ ♪ Geography, recitation, ♪ ♪ French history, redaction, ♪ ♪ what a program! ♪ ♪ Despite time flying, ♪ ♪ it is true that ♪ ♪ memories from school ♪ ♪ can never be forgotten. ♪ ♪ Mister Schoolteacher, ♪ ♪ I will never forget the day, ♪ ♪ during our last lesson, ♪ ♪ our last tuition, ♪ ♪ when I felt on my body ♪ ♪ your hand, whispering, ♪ ♪ "Have a good journey!" ♪ ♪ Mister Schoolteacher, ♪ ♪ It can't be helped, these memories, ♪ ♪ I often remember them ♪ ♪ they always come to my mind ♪ ♪ And I always feel a bit ashamed ♪ ♪ that I have never ♪ ♪ sent you some news ♪ ♪ Despite time flying, ♪ ♪ it is true that ♪ ♪ memories from school ♪ ♪ can never be forgotten. ♪ A young, lustful boy, is taking a shower.

He was a male, a young man, a mature man, leaning on a terrace, looking at the passers-by A virile-looking guy. Jeans, boots, belt, leather jacket open on a hairy chest... Someone fresher, cleaner. Like one can see in an ad. "What a nice fashion show", I was thinking. But the characters looked... superficial. And so inaccessible! Delicate stone sculptures covered with bronze! The fear of breaking them wouldn't let us approach them. Attracted by their fidelity, but afraid to be the prey of a cruel game I wouldn't understand, I left this jungle so peculiarly organized. Just a few steps further, I was near the Saint Guardian of the families. I was getting some fresh air near the water, watching the kids' performance. So there were two universes, very close geographically, but very different. One with our family, one near the pound. People the age of my father, my brother...

A teenager dreaming of caresses and love from somebody else than his family, his nation or his teacher. But it is forbidden. Even more for an infamous love. So to the images of his nation, Bruno opposed images from his dreams and his fantasies. He became a Little Nemo in Slumberland, promised land he was sharing with other angels. Bruno dressed according to the images society gives to homosexuality He wallows in these images. He wears fancy dresses, just like policemen, sailors, plumbers or thugs do. Looking at our social education system from a sexual point of view, the need to hide penises and deflowered anuses is very biased but also very indicative of the inequalities men/women, active/passive, exploiters/exploited, screwers/screwed, fuckers/fucked and their consequences, frustration, ugliness, repression and other flaws. Bruno's sex is cultural, erotic, pornographic, social, political, poetic... whatever. It existed, anyway. Though, parents, priests, educators, psychoanalysts, policemen... All deny the existence of sex before the age of 18. They give childhood and adolescence an image of innocence and purity. They are denied the right to love and it gives them acne. The angels have a sex. They can use it to be happy. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG Proofreading: flipflink
