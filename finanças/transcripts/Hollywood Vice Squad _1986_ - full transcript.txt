Yes. (tires screeching) Hello baby. - What did you have in mind? - I am new in town. I come to America, the land of opportunity, to make a Hollywood movie and to meet the blonde bombshell. - You just met her, honey. - Oh thank you very much. Friends say to me, come to Hollywood Boulevard. - Well you came to the right place. You're not with the police, are you? - Police come to Hollywood Boulevard too? Everybody have fun in America. - Yeah we'll have lots of fun. What's your name, fella? - They call me Long Wang. - I'll bet they do. - It's my Hollywood stage name. (giggling) So what are we going to do? - Drive. (intense music) - What the hell are you doing? Jesus Christ. Get the fuck out of the way! Come on! (car horn honking) Come on! (loud crashing) Six Victor 90, my partner's in trouble. - Please, nothing crazy, I want to live. You can have all of my money. - You bet your ass I can. Now drive you fucking slope head, to someplace nice and quiet. - Slope head? - Drive! - I got a black and white code three, I'm in pursuit. (tires screeching) - Faster, make this Jap trap move, you guys made it. - But I'm Chinese. - Same shit. Move! (tires screeching) (car horn honking) God dammit, you're a cop. - I no cop. - Bullshit! - Alright, I'm a cop. (tires screeching) (grunting) (tires screeching) (squealing) He's a drag queen and he tried to 211 me. - You go down the hill, I'll go around. - Alright. (intense music) Ah shit! (loud splashing) Hey so you gonna help me, or what? - I can't swim. - What do you mean you can't swim? - I can't swim. - You never told me that. - You never asked. That's enough Ray, we want this asshole in the courthouse not the coroner's office. - You know what that fruitcake called me? A fucking slop head. - Well? - My parents were born in Italy, I was raised in an Italian ghetto, and I happen to make a kick ass cannelloni. - [Stevens] Yeah right. And I thought this guy had an identity problem. - Rough night, sweetie? - Oh aren't we testy tonight. I bet you're a fucking Leo. (speaking in foreign language) Chili con carne to you too. - I gotta tell you something, you're beautiful, never shave. I think he likes you. (phone buzzing) - Yeah. Who? Send her in. Mrs. Stanton, please have a seat. Didn't you get my letter? - Oh yes, I did. - I'm afraid you've made a mistake. The wait out here could be very long and painful for you. - Do you think it would be any less painful in Ohio? - Do you have any concept about what goes on out there? Any idea at all? - Look Captain Jensen, this is not the only place where life is hard. I had Lori when I was 17 years old. Her father's never even seen her. I quit school to raise her and I haven't stopped working since. I'm familiar with a hard life. - But that's the Midwest, Mrs. Stanton. Let me give you a crash course about Hollywood. Each year thousands of youngsters come out here reaching for their dreams. They're out there now on the streets wondering where their next meal will come from. Most of them will be victims of one kind or another. Too many will wind up in jail, county general, or the morgue. Now please understand the last thing I need is another well meaning mother wandering the sewers. - She's my daughter, my only child. - Does she drink, do drugs? - She drinks, I guess most kids do. She doesn't do drugs, nothing like that. - [Jensen] Does she know anybody in LA? - Right before I left town one of her girlfriend's gave me this letter from her. Man named Walsh wanted to help her get into show business. - Walsh? - James Walsh. - What else can you tell me about your daughter? - She's um, just a little girl. She has a lot of growing up to do. Actually Lori is a very quiet girl. Not so much with her friends, but with strangers. I always had to watch over her. I didn't smother her, but I always tried to take care of her. She never had to work, she doesn't know how to cook, she wouldn't even know how to make a living. I can't imagine her in a big city like Hollywood. (ominous music) - [Jensen] This is Six Victor Commander, I want Hawkins to put a case together on James Walsh and Pretty Girl Escorts. - [Police Radio Man] Roger 90. - Mr. Walsh, your phone messages. - Thank you, Charlene. - You have any messages for me Charlie? - The name is Charlene. - How come you never give me my messages? - Because you're such an asshole. Go on in. - Suppose you told Mr. Walsh about these nasty rumors I've been hearing lately? - I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't been holding out on tips, Mr. Walsh, I promise. - Bullshit. What is it Lori, hmm? You losing your little girl charm? Maybe just getting lazy? - No I'm not. I'll try harder, I will. - You better. 'Cause that stuff you like so much that makes you feel so good is expensive. - I know it is. - And another thing, you don't carry this stuff when you're working. - That's right. I can come up with the bail for a whore bust, but if they catch you with that stuff I might have to let you rot. You understand, don't you? You understand, don't you? Say it! - Yes I understand! - Good. Good. So good. You better get to work. - Thank you, sir. (upbeat music) - [Man] Hey baby, you a working girl? - Pull into the lot so we can talk about it. Okay that's far enough buddy, just stop right here. Looking for something? - A party. Would you like to join? - What kind of party? - You, me, and Mike. - You, me, and who? - You, me, and Mike, here in the car. - Who's Mike? - Who's Mike? - Meet Mike, shake hands. Get acquainted. - I bet you have names for every part of your body, huh? - I thought I'd heard everything. - I call mine Roscoe, only when we're on good terms. - What do you call your ass? (laughing) - Rory, what do you call yours? - Jaws. (laughing loudly) - Hey he likes you, I can tell. Come on, go ahead, don't be shy. - I'm a little shy. - He's really very friendly. He likes to play. A secret. Mike just loves getting kissed behind his left ear. You're getting real excited, right? - Does it show? - The glazed eyes give you away. Come on, well you can look at it real close. Alright, will you do it for $50? - Okay bought and paid for. (upbeat music) - [Man] $55. - [Betty] That's more like a speed limit than an actual offer. - [Man] Hey it's a work of art? You know some works of art you can look at from far away. But some, you have to get real close. - Hey, hey, police. - Oh my god. What's that doing down there? - Ricky. - [Ricky] Shut off the fucking car. Hey come on, shut off the car. - You dented my dildo. - This is not funny, will you please stop the car? - Now I'll have to buy the kit a new paint patch set. (tires screeching) No way, no way, Grace would kill me for this. - You son of a bitch. (tires screeching) - Kill me, kill me. If you don't, Grace will. - I'm gonna take your fucking suspenders and wrap them around your neck. Stop the car. - [Man] You ruin my car service. (loud crashing) What'd I tell ya. - Come on. - I'm innocent. Innocent as the day is long. - Everything's okay. (zipping loudly) - Of course. (screaming) I wanna die, I wanna die! - You're not gonna die, you're not gonna die in my custody, too many reports. - You are hurting my arm. - Why did you move in on my bust like that? - You were as nervous as a whore in church. - You asshole, that was my bust, I could've handled it. - That's Mr. Asshole to you. - Listen Rambo, I can do anything that you can do. - Oh yeah? - I bet you can't grow a beard. - I bet you can't pee standing up. - I bet you and Mike could teach me. (upbeat music) (kids giggling) - [Kid] I wanna see. - Hey kids, what's going on? (kids laughing) - [Barry] Come on let's not be afraid to hurt the kid here. What do you think we're making, Mary Poppins? - [Woman] Jesus Christ Barry, what do you expect he's only 16. - I don't give a damn, he's supposed to act. No, no, no. Come over here, stand over there, not like that. I need some pain here, pain. That's what sells cassettes. See this, like this, see this? Moron, like that. Alright here we go. Tina, get in here, hurry it up. You think any chance I get this shot today? - [Camera Man] Clear the lens, I wanna get a vote. - [Barry] Let's get it right this time. God dammit, I've spent a lot of money. - [Camera Man] Cameras rolling. - Let's do a take. - [Camera Man] Viking Love Space scene A take two. - [Barry] And action. - Take this gift, oh viking queen. - [Queen] I accept this boy. - So what else is new? This is the porno capital of the world. - I've got a feeling this guy's in some real rough stuff. And besides, I think he's using underage kids. - Then give it to Miller and Chavez, if it's violent enough they'll put a case together. - I'd like to work on this one myself. - Betty, you don't know shit from shinola about porno investigations. Let me tell you something, nine out of 10 of these cases get thrown out on a technicality. These guys know how to make a porno bust stand up in court. - I'm sure they do, but I think I could handle the investigation just as good as they could. I'd like to try it myself, nothing against them. - You could learn a lot from Miller and Chavez, but not if you're always pushing. - But Captain, among other things they resent working with women. - That's bullshit. They resent competition, especially from a younger officer. I know you mean well, but you come on just a little too strong. - But Captain. - But nothing. Give the info to Miller and Chavez and I'll tell 'em you're working with 'em. - Yes sir. - Six Victor Commander, this is Six Victor 26 we're just about ready to bust into Jessie's again, even though I don't like it. - [Jensen] Neither do I 26, but if you don't Luchessi might blow away half the books in this town. - Hey looks like Jessie's doing some business today. - [Ron] You know any book maker that's not doing business this time of day? - Mm hmm. Two dollar round robin, four to six, and second and third. Okay Freddy. You got it, baby. - Jessie my man, you got something for a dry throat? - You ain't set it up for last week. Now you want a freebie? - Man you know I'm good for it. Hey after the fourth race, I'm gonna be making the champagne sing. - Two dollars a race, all you're gonna be making is the soda water sing. (upbeat music) - If I make the stiff I'll give you the signal. Try and get the phone while I'm still on it, judges love that kind of evidence. (upbeat music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Yeah. - Yeah this is VK Arne. Is number four scratched in the third race? Well let me have five dollars across the board. Yeah is High Top scratched in the seventh race to Saratoga? - Saratoga? Hang on, I'll check. - Go, go. - We're off and running. (intense music) (loud crashing) Move over there, Jesse. Ron? - Yeah he was taking the third bet. Did he wipe it off the table? - No, come on over. (yelping) - Police officers, freeze. - Oh my god. - God help me, I'm crippled. (screaming) - Woman, shut your mouth. - Why? What the hell's going on here? - Oh shit woman anytime you see your face busting on a book in the neighborhood, you know they gotta be cops. (yelping) - Anybody see a search warrant? - Why are you doing this to me, Sergeant? This is the third bust in two months. - I try to tell ya Jesse. If you keep me busy someplace else, I wouldn't be dropping in so often. Like stiffing me at the Luchessi operation. - Man you must be smoking some of that funny stuff. That cat plays hardball. I mean hard. - Come on Jesse, you and I go back a lot of years. You know I wouldn't put you up front. - You don't have to, he'll find out some way. - How? All you have to do is ID him, I'll take care of the rest. - Do you know how mean that dude is? He's got New York in back of him. - We're talking about extortion. How much are you paying him, Jesse? - Come on Sarge, don't be asking me questions like that. - You know it's hard for me to believe that the books in this town would knuckle under to some strong arm punk from back east. - When you get old the bones get brittle, you don't move so fast, Sarge. - For Christ sakes Jesse, let me help you. - I don't know, Sarge.

Something about a missing girl. I figured we better do it now though before you got yourself involved with some popcorn pimp or something. So just why are we getting involved with a missing juvie story? - Something the mother said. Kid got hooked up with Jim Walsh. Ring a bell? - Yeah, Pretty Girl Escorts. - One in the same. Here she is, Lori Stanton. - Just how long ago were these taken? - A year and a half ago. - She'll look 10 years older now. - Any of his girls talk? - Walsh's girls are too terrified of him to roll over. He's a ruthless bastard, he'd kill anyone who talks. - You know the thing about Walsh is he keeps him on dope, and when he's done with 'em they either die or disappear. But I got an idea on just how we might be able to operate Walsh's short spot. - I'm listening. - We've all known how Walsh and the others have been selling, renting, and leasing whores to each other for years. So why not nail his ass for slavery? - Slavery? You've lost me, Hawk. - Well now check this out. Meet Edward DeBussey. Yeah I like that. See I just happen to be the baddest dude to ever come from Detroit, and I'm in the pleasure business, the pleasure business, and I gots to build my stable, don't you know. - Sounds risky. - Yeah but what we do is we buy girls from Walsh and then we nail his ass. - Come on Cap.

(laughing) - Look man, I was at the hospital and I forgot. - Oh don't give me that crap. You said you were gonna meet us this morning. Where were you? - The deal's off. I'd rather live. - Are you out of your mind? Luchessi already has his finger on you. If some blue suiter stops him for a ticket, he'll put you back in the hospital. - Look Sarge, you catch me dirty bust me, if not then back off. - Come off it Jesse. We know Luchessi's doing a number on all the books. If we don't get cooperation, the alley's will be filled with books and betters waiting to be scooped up by the paramedics. Right now we're the only friends you have. - This body can't afford your friendship. I'll take my chances, so just leave me be. - Suit yourself. Let's go. Stay as close to him as possible, Luchessi's next step might be murder. - Yes sir. (tense music) (phone ringing) - Yeah. Hey look she knew there were certain hazards involved with using nipple clamps, alright? And look so what if they're black and blue, use a little makeup to cover them up, okay? Alright? Ciao. (tense music) - God dammit Betty, you can't do those kinds of things, it's against the law. - But I caught the degenerate cold. - We can't use any of that stuff as probable cause. Everything you did was illegal. Frankie, talk to her. - Hey. - I have other evidence. - Christ, I'm afraid to ask. - Listen to me. First, our man has several busts in New York and Philly for S&M but no convictions. Second, I ran those plates and came up with the name Nesbitt, a cameraman who was busted for child porno five years ago here in LA, he did six months in county. Wait I'll show you. Oh shit, hi Captain. - What's going on? - We underestimated her, right. - Yeah, case is looking good. - Mr. DeBussey. - It's DeBussey. - Right, right. Have you made a decision, Mr. DeBussey? - I'd like three girls. - [Walsh] Have you made up your mind on the terms? - I want to buy them outright. So how much? - We'll talk about that later after the showing. - Tonight I'm gonna take care of a convention, I'd like the three to attend a party. - Yeah no, no, no parties, no, no, no. - Makes it too easy for rip offs. - The cops like to use parties. - So what's your proposition? - I'll call you a few hours before the convention and give you the details. - You have a nice day, eh, Mr. DeBussey. - That's right. (intense music) - Why don't we just prowl? - I'll do it. - The warrants are tight. See anything good just add it and give us an update. - If we're lucky. - I keep thinking about that poor kid. You've gotta be crazy to do that kind of shit. - No brains, no headaches. (distant screaming) - Something's up. - Some bastard's in there screaming like a banshee, and all the lights are on, they've gotta be shooting. - I'll call it in, someone can run it over to a judge. - What do you mean call it in? By the time we get a warrant signed, some poor kid will be history. - Without a warrant we can lose the case. - Hey come on she's right Tom, screw the warrant, screw it. - Fuck it vamanos. (intense music) Take the back in case anyone tries to split. (loud crashing) - Hey, get the fuck out of here. God damn cops! (women screaming) Get the hell out! (women screaming) (loud crashing) - [Man] What the hell's going on. - [Woman] No, get away. - [Frankie] You shut the fuck up! (glass shattering) (groaning) (loud thudding) (whistling) - Please try to run, barf bag. - Need any help? - Yeah, could I borrow your cuffs? - Anytime, partner. (knocking on door) - I wasn't at the hotel when you called, but I came as soon as I got your message. - Please sit down. I'm sorry. - Oh she isn't? - No. (sighing) This Jim Walsh you were telling me about, he runs an out call service called Pretty Girl. - I don't understand. - Your daughter's a prostitute. - That's ridiculous. Your best detectives have come up with the wrong Walsh. That's not my Lori. - I'm sorry Pauline, but we haven't made a mistake. And I'm afraid it's worse. She's on heroin. (humming happily) - Why you come busting in my house? I've done nothing wrong. - Jesse, you put me in a very bad mood lately. Your friends the cops, they've been following me around. - I told you they ain't my friends. How many fucking times do I have to tell you? I've been playing ball. (glass shattering) (loud thudding) - Alright guys, let's go down to the station, this shouldn't take too long. - This ain't gonna take too long neither. (groaning) - Hey, what the hell are you doing? - I want some more of that mother. Pretty good for an old fart, huh? - Daniello, how are you doing? - Beautiful. - You're looking good. - Thanks. - Working? - Sure. - [Farber] Staying out of trouble? - Sure. - [Farber] Mr. Walsh has a nice piece of work for you here. - Daniello, look I really don't expect any problem tonight, but it pays to have a little insurance. Look you remember our little talk on the phone? - Yeah. - You know where to go, you know what to do? If he doesn't fuck her that means it's a scam and you've gotta waste him. Daniello. I don't need any witnesses either. - Beautiful. - You're the best. - So are you, pal. (phone ringing) - You got me. Uh huh. Diamond Gems on Hollywood Boulevard, half an hour. - Okay this is it, don't let him slip through our fingers. - We'll take care of it. It's party time. (upbeat music) - [Man] Arthur, Arthur right here. - Hey Mr. DeBussey, right on time, sir. And this is Veronica. - Nice to meet you. - Veronica is my associate as well as being my main lady. Why don't you ask your lady to join us? (snapping) Ah, that's terrific. We're a regular foursome. - [Hawkins] Yeah just like the rich folks. - Right. - Let's do what they do and take care of business. - I've uh, I've got two works of art set up for tonight. - Two? I asked for three. - We start with two. They'll provide the entertainment for the boys at the bar there and if everything goes alright, you'll get the third one. - Man, what are you talking about? - Look I don't know you, I don't know your clients. You could be cops, you're ripping me off trying to steal my girls from me, so let's just take it one step at a time. Alright? If you and the boys are what you say you are there's no problem. But I'm the one who has everything to lose, see? So I'm taking control of this situation. - Well now let's see. You expect me to send my two men off while you keep that gorilla at my back. - No, no, no, no. You mean Farber here, he goes with them. - That way they won't be lonely. - This ain't business, this is bullshit man! - How's that uh, how's that expression go uh, oh yeah, take it or leave it. (snapping) - Yeah boss. - The man here is full of fun and games, wants to two of you to trick two of his ladies. - Alright a little fringe benefit, huh? - Here, just in case you don't have enough charm for a freebie. - I'm telling you man, that son of a bitch is no fool. - Someone gets to make a call. (intense music) - Oh god, I feel awful. I wish he'd get here. (cocking gun repeatedly) Do you have to play with that thing, Daniello? - Aren't we jumpy. I just bet you could use something to calm your nerves. - [Lori] No kidding. - Just do your job and you'll get your shit. It'll be very groovy. - I just wish the guy would show up so we could get this over with. - You should meditate, it's beautiful. - Oh great. - So pal, how'd you get this job? - Go fuck yourself. - Must've went to college. - Excuse me, time for the little boys room. - Wait, wait, do me a favor will you? Just humor me one more time. Look under the table and take a look at Veronica's snatch. - Say what? - [Walsh] You won't believe it. - My man, your elevator don't quite make it to the top. - I can guarantee he's not gonna see anything he hasn't seen before. - Go ahead, please. Isn't that something. - What's the matter, baby? - Just sit there quietly and enjoy your drink, puta. - What's going on? - Nothing, just a weird sense of humor. Chick here is giving brand new life to the term beaver shot. - That's funny. (laughing) - Okay it's room 208, all you gotta do is say Jim sent me. Oh ho, ho, no, no, no, nobody said anything about orgies. Just the chink here. That way you have your own private pad. Now you get in the car and drive. You enjoy yourself. - Remember Ray if you touch her we lose the case. - [Farber] Get in the car. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hey man I'm not gonna do anything stupid, okay. You get her to point that thing somewhere else, accidents do happen. - If I blow your balls off it won't be an accident. - Just a little while longer, alright? If everything's okay, your house boy's gonna be alright. - What's that supposed to mean? - If the China man plays any games, there's a shotgun in the closet that'll give him a radical lesson. - [Walsh] Shut up! (knocking on door) - Who are you? - Oh uh Jim sent me. - Hey man I don't give a shit about your fun and games right, but I gotta go to the bathroom. If I don't get there soon I'm gonna piss in my pants and this here is silk, man. - Cross your legs. (loud crashing) (gun shots blasting) (loud thudding) Ow! Somebody stop him! - [Woman] Oh, is the food that bad? - Like a drink? - Yeah sure, that'd be fine. (intense music) Uh listen would you uh mind if I wash my hands? I'll be right back. - She says her name is Veronica Ramos and she's not talking. - Dammit. We don't have much time, now make a deal with her if you have to but find out where Chang and Stevens are. - Yes sir. - What are you looking at me like that for? I'm going to the hospital, not the morgue. - Hey baby, we almost met it. - He's gonna pay for this and it's on you. - You got it. - That's it, that's all you heard? Just a shotgun in the closet, no location, nothing else? - [Hawkins] That's it, Captain. - Excuse me, Captain. - What have you got? - Tropicana Motel, Santa Monica Boulevard. - Great, room number? Judy, you handle things here, I'm gonna find Chang. - Alright. - I'm gonna borrow this. - And you've got to find Walsh. (sirens blaring) - [Jensen] Six Victor Commander, the Tropicana Motel on Santa Monica Boulevard, request backup. (sirens blaring) (intense music) - Straight ahead, huh? - Yeah. - You know what I've been thinking about doing? - No, what's that? (tires screeching) - All clean. - Great. Why don't you take your jacket off? - [Chang] Take my jacket off. Sure. - Make yourself comfortable. Yeah right here on the bed that's fine, just lay it down. (intense music) - Yeah boss? - Chang doesn't know it, but there's a shooter hiding in the closet with a shotgun. - Oh shit. Cuff that asshole in the front seat. - Do you believe the weather we've been having lately? - Come on, let's get it on. What are you waiting for? Get undressed. - [Chang] Hey baby, what's the hurry. We haven't even talked about business yet. - If we scare this guy he'll open fire. We don't know which room he's in. - Well I know what room he's in, 208. - Great. Now let's get a map of this place and I want you to try to get into the bathroom window. Can you do that? - You bet. - Let's go. - Uh. How much? - $200 up front. - [Chang] And what do I get for my $200? - Anything you want. - Listen you think I could get another drink? I'm really thirsty. (intense music) (screaming) (gun shots blasting) (screaming) (gun shots blasting) - Leave me alone, leave me alone please, leave me alone! - You're alright, come on. (crying) Come on you're okay. Come on, come on, you're okay, you're okay. Okay we're gonna get you help. (intense music) - Freeze motherfucker. (gun shots blasting) - You lousy bitch. (gun shot blasting) - I don't know anything else. Why would they tell me any of those things anyway? - Well we'll be in touch. Now your mother's outside. - What? I don't wanna see her. She didn't care about me. All she thinks about is what other people say. - You're being pretty hard on her, aren't you? - What do you know about any of this? - I know a policeman's in the hospital and a couple of your asshole friends are in the morgue. And if it wasn't for your mother, you would probably be in there with them. If it wasn't for her, nobody would care if you screwed your brains out, or rotted in jail, or OD'd on that shit. When you mother found out you might be in LA, she dropped everything and came out here searching for you. She's gone through hell. Does that sound like somebody who doesn't care? Listen Lori, maybe your mother did make some mistakes, but it should be obvious that she loves you very much, and that you both need each other. - Right. - You think about it. - [Announcer] Sixth floor nursing supervisor, call your office. - Pauline I'm sorry, she doesn't want to see you. Give her time, she's been through a lot. - [Lori] Mom? (crying) - Why do you do this to me? - Look, will you just give me my hat? - No. - Why? - Because this is stupid, it's the middle of July. - How long have we known each other? - Five years. - And in all that time have I ever done anything to make you question my judgment? - Yes. - [Chang] What do you mean yes? - Well what about the time you dressed up like a rabbi? - Oh forget about that. - And the Shriner? - Alright, alright I'm human, I make mistakes. - And how about when you dressed up like a wiener? A god damn wiener. - Listen, I'm telling you it's gonna work. It is every hooker's fantasy to fuck Santa.
