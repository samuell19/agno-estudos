AIzimmara! AIzimmara! AIzimmara! Luciano? Luciano, open the door. AIzimmara! AIzimmara! AIzimmara! - Luciano? - Is everything ok, AIzimmara? Luciano, open the door. AIzimmara! - Call the police! - AIzimmara! Where's AIzimara? She's inside. Everything's fine. What's going on? The gunshot was in another house, I'm going there now. Where's your badge? What's happening in there? AIzimmara is dead! He killed AIzimmara! Police! Gethimm! He's on Ms. elen roof! Go! Go! Shoot him! Shoot him! Get him, get him! WaKe up! WaKe up! It's not worKing. It's broKen again. You're useless. You've got a hole in your head! Uncle! Our Lord, bless this family and the food we eat. In the name of Jesus. Amen. Ccero, taKe this boy to the city. He can be a policeman. Would be great. But it's up to him. He doesn't want to work the Land, he doesn't want to repairtyres. He doesn't want to be a policemman, what does he want to do? Uncle! Uncle, JÚIio doesn't want to go, can I come with you? Shut up, Pedro! What are you afraid of, JUlio? You're strong, intelligent and handsome. You ought to trust yourself more, Kid. Come with me, it will be fine. In the city... Uncle, if I go, when will I come bacK? You haven't even gone and you're thinKing about coming bacK! If I had an aim IiKe yours, I'd be a millionaire. - Juliáo. - Yes? This is a wild boar you,II never forget. Your guts are rotten! Shut up and drive! Powerful engine. Yes. How much does a car IiKe this cost? Brand new, roughly fifty thousand. The sound system is customised. - What's that? - The guitar! A nice omelette. Eat it, it's delicious. It's not as easy to join the police as your dad thinKs. All your paperworK has got to be up to date. Then you have to wait until the tests. Maybe next year. What am I going to be doing here then? You're going to worK. Doing what? You're going to help me. You've got a great aim. In the city, everything has a cost. There's way too much money in here, uncle. It's a gift from godfather to godson. - Is this him? - Yes. How are you? - Santos. - Julio. Your uncle told me you were a strong guy. You have to see this Kid shoot, Santos. You'II be very useful for our unit. Welcome! How is it going, WaKeman? AII good. How's your daughter's cough? ThanK God she's much better. Those honey Iozenges are amazing. - Much better than medicine. - I see. The pharmaceutical industry is a mafia. This is Julio. How are you? PIeasure. Bye. 'Dental CIinic Dente Bello'. Sounds Italian. I feel IiKe eating Iasagna. Have you ever had Iasagna? Sure. Where did you have it? At home. How is it made? With chicKen. You're out ofyour mind. Lasagna with chicKen? julio! Go. Distract the guy. Me? What am I going to say? Anything. I can't! Breathe! Go! Good evening. I'm not from here. Where's the best place to hang out? What? You Know what I mean. Where I can get a drinK and checK girls out? Oh, oK! Go straight then first Ieft. Go two blocKs... Come! Come on! Is the steaK-parmigiana big enough fortwo? Yes. What does it come with? Fries and rice with broccoli. Fries? Rice and broccoli and some vegetables. Digestion is better if you eat Iightly at night. Why did they asK you to Kill that guy? Our client slide-tacKIed the dentist at football. The dentist punched him. You Killed someone because ofa football match? No. I Killed him because I was paid to do it. I don't care about the reason. It's none of my business. I do thejob properly. That's why I have a good clientele. My motto is to serve well in orderto serve always. You'II end up in hell. Hell is not being able to buy the things you want. There's no shortage of hitmen around, julio. If I don't do thejob someone else will. The sad fucKer's going to die anyway. At Ieast I get the money. Aren't you religious? The hitman doesn't Kill anyone. God does. If it wasn't God's will, there would be no reason for anyone to die. There wouldn't be clients or hitmen. If it wasn't for God's wilI the bullet would miss the sad motherfucKer's head. Everyone's born or dies because God wants it. - How did it go? - Wonderful. Tell Santos what you did to distract the guy. He went to the guy and asKed where the hot chicKs hang out! The Kid's a genius. You were born to do this! AIways use the same gun. It's more precise. We're together, Juliáo! We're together! Good afternoon. I'II have one ofthese, please. - How much is it? - 10 Reais. There'II be a guy waiting for you at the first stop in Acailándia. His name is Moisés. He'II taKe you to Caetano. Caetano is the guy. What are you doing? I don't want to forget anything. SteaK and onion sandwich. It's delicious. The food at the station is horrible. God bless you. Are you Moisés? - Who told you to wait for me? - I'm not supposed to say anything. This is your only chance to purchase this revolutionary product. See the guy with the bright blue shirt? That's him. OK? OKra, jilÓ... Tomatoes... everything is affordable here. Fresh vegetables... Banana and avocado, to maKe a nice smoothie. It's delicious, very fresh... Straight from Caetano's farm. A pamonha, please. Beautiful girls get it for free. Ugly men pay double. There are five functions. You can cut yourvegetables with it, zucchini, potatoes, carrots... Who is it? I've got a message for you. That business with the inspectorwasn't my fault. It wasn't my fault. I didn't snitch. Don't Kill me. My mum's ill. She needs medicine. She's got a Kidney condition. PIease don't Kill me! PIease don't Kill me! Hail Mary, ulloGrace. Our Lord is with you. BIesse dare you ammong wommen, and blesse dis the ruitoyourwommb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother o God, prayorus sinners, now an dat the hour our death. Ammen. Our Father, Who are in heaven, hallowedbe ThyNamme, Thyingdomm comme... There he is. That,s my boy! Not enough? Didn't you get three thousand to do the dentist? So what? Everyjob has a different price. But I really IiKe the way you're so concerned about money. Right, Santos? Ofcourse. Very good. You don't need a test tojoin the police. It's amazing how an uniform always imposes respect. Wearthis when you Ieave the house and when you come bacK. It avoids suspicion. This timme willbe dierent. You're nota kid anymmore, Juliáo. This is a serious business. ThanK you. Juliáo... Listen to me. That bastard raped Mr. Lima,s daughter. She wasn,t even 12! In this business you can't take the ghosts or dead to bed. The first thing you must do is Iearn the code of honour. There are things you must never do. You can't steal. We're not thieves. Never kill another hitmman. Respect your colleagues. The entrance to the ranch is before the Iast petrol station. Perfect. He'II be there at 5. AIways get cash upfront. No credit for death. - Let's go! - You Ieft a guy alive bacKthere, uncle! A good kill is painless. A bullet straight in the head. That's it. Violence is evil. We're professionals. It's JÚIio! Myson's here! It's JÚIio! Hi mum! My son! How are you? Come dad, it's julio! I've missed you! I've got a compressor for you. It's top of the range. - Is the trucK yours? - It's the best there is. Of course it's mine! What do you thinK? Four presents for you. Four presents for you! Do you IiKe them? LooKs good! It's all good. Hi Juliáo! How are things at the station? AII good? OK... Come by for Iunch. Mum will roast a chicKen. Let me Know when you're free so we can have Iunch together. Great. See you! It's a shame to Kill someone. What good does it do? For God's saKe. He's a young guy, he's got a family. His whole Iife's ahead of him. It's too cruel. If you thinK hard about Iife... you'II realize the world's worthless. It's such a pity. But my boss Iends money, and the guy hasn't paid. Unfortunately, he has to be eliminated as a warning. Otherwise it becomes a mess. It's very unpleasant. But what can you do? What can you do? Is there another solution? Want some cheese bread? No thanKs. Aren't you gonna get hungry? TaKe it, I've got another. I don't want it. He gets off at 5. He goes home, has dinner and goes out to get pissed. His son's married to my neighbour's daughter. She's a chiropodist. My wife is her patient. She's got callouses. Health issues aren't ajoKe. What's it IiKe in your Iine ofworK? It can't be easy, can it? Forthe Iove of God. Too much risK. I'II finish it, OK? TaKe this one. I don't want it. On average, how many jobs you do in a month? Sorry. I'm sorry. I apologize for my indiscretion. It's him! PIease forgive me for my indiscretion. Sorry, I've got a big mouth. Good IucK. God bless you. Let's go outside! You Iittle shit! Who do you thinK I am?

Don't you want to Know? - Uncle? - Yes? Can you get me more worK? Ofcourse. Let's put an ad in the paper: "Experienced hitman available... Guaranteed satisfaction or your money bacK". I'm not joKing.
