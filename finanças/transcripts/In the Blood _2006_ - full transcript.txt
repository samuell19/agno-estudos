Carol Glackman. Happened just last night. - An autopsy was performed? - Yes. Tiffany Lee, two weeks ago. Same as the other one? Yep, stabbed and dumped in an alley. I suppose we should make arrangements for a memorial service. Oh, yes, of course. You know, this makes two. Either we shut down campus. Do we refund 15,000 tuitions? Living on an urban campus presents all kinds of dangers. The police are on top of it, we'll beef up our own security, put the campus on high alert. These are sex crimes-- these girls were raped! And it makes me sick. I swear I've lived in this city for over 20 years, Jack, and I'm still shocked at what some people are capable of. The macroeconomic models are developed from N, output, I, interest rates, T, prices, and F, inflation. And of course, there are other variables, as well. There are trade deficits, and surpluses-- I hate this fucking class. Professor's such a faggot. Yeah? I thought you said he was Indian. Oh, yeah, yeah. Right out of his face. A plus. You get those handouts from last week? I think I lost mine. Hey, you're still playing afterwards, right? You know it. Geez, man, it's hot in here. Whatever, man, you're just trying to get extra credit. Wherever I can get it, man. Wherever I can get it. Value of the parcel to the purchaser is reflected on this line, T, F, with the relative point being B. So the monetary value would drop to an I negatives 0. When we follow through on this function, we're going to discover that risk-averse people actually will buy risky assets, if they are-- Card please. Now, pick nine cards with your left hand. Three for the past, three for the present, three for the future. You are familiar with the Tao? The basics. Let's start with the past. The influx of human life. Here is something you hear about your parents-- it's hard to see. A-- a misfortune, perhaps? They died when I was young. Oh, but have a great male influence in your life. A-- a brother, or an uncle. My brother, Cassidy. We're very close. He lives in the house of falsehood. Now, I want you to pick four cards. An unwanted inheritance, an unexpected transmission. I see an emerging acquaintance-- but there's a dark shadow across it. A line meaning, be wary. Perhaps we can see a result. Oh, god. Oh, don't worry-- it doesn't necessarily have to mean death, even if it is the last card. It's maybe a transformation of some kind, or even a rebirth. Well, I'm afraid I have to see my next guest. Afternoon rush. Sure. Everything's going to be fine. Got ya. Ah. Did you think I was a psycho killer? Oh, yeah, cause psychos have hands this soft. Shut up. You were scared. Shit, I've got to go and interview security about Carol Glackman. Who? Hello, that girl they found in the dumpster? Oh, OK. She was in my bio study group. What are you up to? Well, I am-- got class, and then I'm going to go grab a quick game afterwards? So we still on for tonight? Yeah, see, I have to finish writing a paper for tomorrow. But you have time to play basketball? Exercise, keeps the mind fresh, hey. Hey, we can do this tomorrow, though. Can I come over and study with you? Tomorrow, promise. Fine? Fine. See you later. All right. Whoo! So, looks like you found my hideout. Yeah, I tried you at Sandy's, but she said I could find you here. Yeah, what's up? I'm going to go jump in the shower, so I can my shit from this rat hole. Play again tomorrow? Yeah. All right. Mike, this is my sister, Jessica. Nice to meet you, Jess. Jessica is a freshman. Just getting used to the place. Well, the first few weeks are the hardest. Took me almost a month to realize that I own this place. No, it's good that you have your big brother here, Cass, to show you around. I mean, we know everybody around here. We're the biggest men on campus. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, um, I'll walk you out. I'll see you later. Later. Hey, Jess, you, um, ever still want to use this place, you know, give me a call. I'll hook you up with a choice locker. So there was this shadowy figure I have to be wary of, right? And then, at the very end, she turns over the death card. I mean, what do you think that means? Means enough to get you all worried, you'll keep coming back more, so-- Well, then, it's working, because I'm a little spooked. All right, Jess, come on. You know, it always seemed kind of cool when you did magic and Tarot stuff when we were little kids-- most little girls don't do that. But, well, by the time we were in high school, it was already lame. Hey, that's not helping. What I'm saying is, you're in college now. This is your chance to find out who you are. Don't let some hoaxster tell you. Well, I know that, Cassidy. It's just that I've seen a lot of these, and it's unusual for that card to be turned over. And especially with everything that's been going on around here. So it's really those girls dying that's freaking you out. Yeah, I don't know, maybe. You just hear so many rumors that are all conflicted and garbled, and I mean, who knows what could happen? Hey, I know it worries you-- I'm sorry. It's only been two girls. It's hardly a pattern-- it's more like a coincidence. Yeah, I guess so. Even if there is a maniac on campus, I'm here to protect you. All right? You know I'd never let anything happen to you, right? 'Cause you're all I got. Mm-hmm. Listen, I've got to go to the library. Dude, you're bleeding. No fever or severe migraines? No. - Prolonged cold symptoms? No. Any yellowish, nasal discharge? I don't think it's sinusitis. Your blood pressure is a bit high-- that makes some people more prone to bleeding. Do you have a history of this? Wait, yeah, my nose bleeds from time to time, it's just-- it's never been that bad. Do you ever abuse nasal drugs, like cocaine or amphetamine? No. OK. One last question-- have you been under any psychological stress lately? Mental strain has been known to cause these symptoms. It's my senior year-- I rule this school. Well then, here's what I think-- the weather is cooling off, and the humidity levels are dropping. Dry air is notorious for causing nosebleeds. Try eating less salty food, and warm up for a longer period before you lift weights. I'm going to give you this saline nasal spray. It'll moisten the nostrils and prevent bleeding. I don't think you have anything to worry about. But if you have a nosebleed, lean your hand forward put an ice pack on it. Hello? Hi, is this Victor? Yeah. I had called a while back about making an appointment with you for, you know, your services. And I had to cancel, but now I want to reschedule. That will work. How about now? Now? Yeah, yeah, now's fine. Where do you live? No, no, we can't do it here. All right then, come over to my place. OK. All right, um, hold on a second. All right? 3C, OK. I will be there soon. What was your name again? Jason. Jason. All right, Jason, just remember I get paid in cash only. All right? All right. Later. Bye. Hold on. Hold on! What the hell are you doing in here? Hey, you beatin' off? - Man, shut up. I'm just trying to finish my paper. Look, I'm going to-- I'm going to go to the library. It's too noisy in here. Yeah. You know it was another late night at the gym for me. Oh, yeah? Congratulations. Who was she tonight? And now wait, wait till I point her out to you. Then you can really congratulate me. What a body. - Yeah? - Yeah. But she's nothing special in the sound of it, you know, she kind of just laid there. But, uh, I will break her in. Yeah, but you know I could teach you a few things if you'd like. Oh, by the way, how is your, uh-- how's your sister doing? - She's fine. She's uh-- just a little freaked out about those two girls dying. I'll see you later. It's open. So you live near here, or what? I go to school around here. Oh, yeah? I'm trying to get back to school, myself. Sitting on some money. That's not mine. It's my cousin's. He had to stash it here. He's coming back to get it in a couple of days. It's something really important. He hooks me up, so I don't ask any questions. So what are you into? I'm not sure. We can figure it out. Oh, you got lucky dicking me. I'm going to be worth the price. I've even been in adult movies before. You don't get that from those other cracked out hustlers out there. We're going to have a good time. I thought I could do this. You know, just sort of like-- sort of like an experiment, since this being my last year in college, and I just-- god, I just figured I would get this all out of my system. But now I'm here, and I don't think I can do this. This isn't me. This isn't you? Yeah, that's right. Listen, man, that's cool. As long as I get paid. You know what I'm saying? I just changed my mind. Cool. But you know? A lot of guys get scared-- especially their first time. I'm not scared of shit. I just said I changed my mind, all right? Comprende, amigo? Yeah, I understand you, man. I got you. Your closet-caged yuppy ass is a chickenshit. Whatever. Just go back to your ghetto family's dirt life. What did you just say to me, man? I said, I'm getting out of this shit hole, all right? Forget you, man. But you know-- you don't know what you're missing. That's just a sample. No-- no-- no-- no-- Yo, Jason! Jason, you all right in there, man? Oh, dude, man-- what happened? Are you all right? What the hell happened to you in there? Where do you think you're going, dude? Yo, Jason, get back here with my money, man! Mother fucker! Cassidy Blood. Shit. The aromatic kind are often used in dyes that can be carcinogenic. And often they're the cause of unpleasant sticky odors, given off by decaying animal and human matter. Means this ammonia-based groups go through, in which NH bonds are replaced by alkyl substitutes. Ah, uh, amines? Right again. I have to say, this is kind of surprising. - Why? - I don't know. It's just you seem kind of into partying and stuff. Cassidy never mentioned that one of his friends had such a broad range of knowledge. Well, I-- I guess I have a steel trap memory. Well, we could definitely use a fourth for college bowl. But, I mean, do you really want to do it? There are all these practices you'd be required to attend, not to mention the actual tournaments. Wait, well what are you saying? Saying I'm just some irresponsible jock, who's only into chasing women and drinking beer? I'm sorry-- I really didn't mean to offend you. Well, I am. But that doesn't mean that I don't want to help my school's college bowl team. You seem a little tense, Jess. You know Cass told me that you were, um, a little freaked out by these campus murders. Maybe we can go get something to eat tonight? Maybe downtown. You know, I actually have this exam tomorrow that I need to study for. It's really big. But maybe some other time. What is that? The killer strikes again! Who is it? Sheila Evans. Did you know her? Me neither. Did you know Carol Glackman or Tiffany Lee? No, who are they? The two other murder victims. I have freshman comp with Carol. She was a major suck-up. That's a terrible thing to say. Am I suppose to lie about her just because she's dead? Apparently, the killer raped his victims before he killed them. People say all kinds of things. You will not believe what I got. When I was being questioned in the dean's office, I swiped a copy of the files on the murders. Police reports, crime photos, any tense stuff. Look. This is nasty. You could get in trouble. Maybe so, but if I were you, I'd be careful. He only attacks blond girls. That's not true. Look at the pictures, read the reports. It also says this guy likes to deflower his victims before he kills them. He prefers virgins, so watch out. What makes you think I'm a virgin? Anyway, three blond girls doesn't necessarily make a pattern. Well, the dean seems to think so. He's put together a list of girls he thinks may be at risk. And you're on it. Hey. I was hoping I'd see you today. Yeah, just wanted to make sure everything's OK. So, how is your roommate? Ann? Oh, she's fine. I think she finds all this amusing. You're doing OK, right? Yeah. Although, I'm kind of embarrassed. Why? I don't know. I know that psychics and Tarot aren't actually real. I don't even know why I got a reading. I guess it just made me feel more comfortable, you know? Reminded me of high school. Look, I'm sorry I came down on you so hard yesterday. No, I know I needed to hear that. I mean, how long can I stay a silly little girl, right? But I'm starting to feel a little better. I like Ann, college bowl's fun. Good. That's good. I'm glad to hear that. Oh, your friend Michael just joined. He did? Yeah, he's really smart. You never told me one of your friends have such a photographic memory. Listen, I gotta get to lab dissection. Hey, be careful around campus. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm all grown up. Yeah, right-- seriously, though, you know, if you're going to go somewhere at night, call me. I'll walk you. OK. Bye. Is this the psych test? Yo, Cass, what's you problem? Stay away from my sister. - I don't know what you mean. - Yeah, you do. Come on, man, what did you do? Steal the college bowl practice questions? Huh? Look at her answers when she went to the bathroom? Relax! Dude, I know what your fucking tricks are, all right? See? What's this? Huh? Flash cards is how everybody studies for college bowl. Look, I'm going to tell you this once, all right? Don't be using your pick-up games on my sister, all right? OK, Cass. Who's there? There is no friend like a sister in calm or stormy weather. I've seen blood. So you don't recognize me? You're following me. That's right. We need to talk. No, I'm getting security. I have seen your sister bleed! He steals her youth. Who are you? I know it's been a while, Cassidy. Don't you recognize your Aunt Helen? We should talk. I've kept close watch on the development of you and your sister. So why haven't I heard from you since I was like 10? Uh, it's complicated, Cassidy. Your mother never liked me to be around her family. And then about a week before her accident, she called me and she told me that if-- if something were to happen, I was to keep away from you and Jessica. I was furious with her for saying that. And then she did die. And I was so angry, I couldn't see it. That doesn't sound like my mother. Of course it does! She loved you dearly. And she was disgusted by my occupation. Psychic? I'm not your additional psychic, Cassidy. My abilities only appear under certain circumstances. I don't know what you mean. I engage in a process of full release. I sleep with my clients. You mean you're a prostitute. My clairvoyance only manifests itself during moments of sexual intimacy. I see the future when I have sex. Yeah, yeah, I think-- I think you need some help. Your mother's gifts were astounding. My mother wasn't some sex freak like you, all right? Look, just because you're going through some weird crisis in your life, don't think that you can force your way back into my life, or into Jessica's life. Now, I don't want to see you around here anymore. Understand? OK, see, now, you don't have to help me do this. Watch-- see? I can do it myself. I know. I like to. You know, I thought I'd be seeing a lot more if you when I decided to go here. Our schedules are so full, I feel like I hardly ever see you anymore. Yeah. Also, you seem kind of distant lately. Is everything OK? Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. You know you can always talk to me if you want to, if anything is bothering you. How are things with you and Sandy? Do you remember anything about mom's sister, Helen? Yeah, vaguely. I think I remember an Aunt Helen taking a bee stinger out of my hand at a barbecue. Hmm, I remember the bee sting. That's right, I remember laughing at you, while you were dancing around crying. Yeah, I remember that, too. Why the sudden curiosity? No reason. If you think about mom and dad, you should look through their stuff in storage. It's where I go when I'm thinking about them. There's photo albums and dad's books and stuff. There's of them there than in their graves. I can't look at that stuff. It's too painful. Sometimes, I wonder, Jess-- I mean, is it easier or worse for you to have fewer memories of them than I do? I don't know, I mean, I-- I guess sometimes I just feel like I've never been as happy as I was those first 10 years of my life. Maybe everyone feels that way. We'll never know. Yeah. I guess not. Anyway, I'm not trying to get all heavy. I just-- I'm just trying to remember Helen. You know, what she looked like. You should definitely look at the pictures in storage. It's not that big of a deal just to fidget with some old things. Shit. Your mother's gifts were astounding. Your mother was always ashamed with her gift-- but in her teens, she experimented with it rampantly. She'd come out of the bathroom with flecks under her nose, and I'd taunt her. She'd throw a fit. But at night, she would tell me what she saw. Clear and precise visions. Better solo than I've ever had with a partner. I think it was out of jealousy that I would tease her. It was because of me that she felt like such a misfit. After she married, she buried it. And then she became standoffish. I just-- I find this hard to believe about my mom. You must believe it. If she had trusted her visions, she would never have gotten on that plane with your father. I made a promise to protect you and Jessica, and I have also been tempted to make sure that you understood your gift when the time was right. Now, if you have the ability, you must have already had several episodes. You have, haven't you? You've seen-- No. You've seen bloody visions of your sister. I don't know, no. Now, think, Cassidy. My ability fades with age. But I did have the distinct image of Jessica covered in blood. Does any of this mean anything to you at all? Yeah, I may have seen something like that. Like a daydream. No, no, not a daydream. Well, I can't remember! I know. I know this is an awful lot for you to handle. This is going to sound strange-- the next time you have an intimate experience, pay close attention. Let it be a pure, assented sexual experience. Open your mind to its-- oh, your sister made this when she was very young. I've always liked it, and I keep it close for luck. You take it now. Remember-- you must lose yourself in the sexual moment. Your sister's life may depend on it. Thanks for waiting. I'm sorry to bring you in here, Jessica. Sometimes I'm compelled to do things I find unpleasant. Do you know this is? It's that girl who got killed? Have you seen this picture before? Jessica, a dean is powerless against the forces of campus scandal mongers. I don't want to scare you, I'm going to have to talk to all the female students on campus. Not all of them, actually, just a few of a particular type. There's someone wondering about this campus. I don't know if he's been stopped, or if he will strike again. But this disturbed individual has chosen this university as his arena in which to prey upon students. It would seem that this man, this-- this half-crazed criminal prefers young women with blond hair, and an overall innocent appearance. Young women like yourself. Do I transfer or dye my hair black? No, no, nothing that drastic. I just need you to be extra cautious. That's all. I've asked security to keep a close eye on you and the other girls. Just be aware of any strange behavior. And remember, sometimes those you trust can hurt you the most. I'm sorry, Jessica. I know this is hard for you. The world is a dangerous place. And sometimes being as young and beautiful as you are, attracts the wrong kind of attention. This will all blow over in time, it will be stopped somehow. - So was I right? - What? I know the dean met with you. What did he say? Was I right about the victims? Yes, Ann, you were right. The police are watching us blond girls. I knew it. I told you. And they're virgins, too. Look at this-- broken hymen, tearing-- doctors can tell if you're a virgin or not. Whatever. Ah, this guy must be some real sexual deviant. I'm glad I don't fit into any of the victim criterion. Jess, please, I've had sex. - Who? - Peeta. You know we're more than friends. Anyway, you have to stop handing out these Xerox photos. The dean had a copy, and he was not happy. He had a copy? Oh, my god, this is crazy! What else did he say? Nothing, just be aware of strange men on campus. Hey, what's up, guys? Um, can one of you tell me where I can find Cassidy Clarke? The number 13 was used because it represented witches' covens, and the worship of mother goddess, as well as the Last Supper. All types of media and techniques were employed, and before it was finished in 1979, 400 workers were employed in its creation. Name this feminist work of art, featuring place settings for 39 important women, created by Judy Chicago? Oh. Think food. The Dinner Party. Damn. You're good. OK, all right, here's another one. You know, maybe we should hold off. I mean, I'm nearly 50 minutes late. OK. Hey Rachel where are you? Oh, he did? No, sure, that's fine. We can reschedule any time this week. Just give me a all, OK? Bye. She said you canceled. She's She is right. Michael-- college bowl's in a few weeks. We have to study. - I know, Jess. I-- I just think that you and I make a good team. Well, despite what you think, the rules stipulate that we need four team members, not two. Do you want to know the real reason why I joined the team? Put your mind to good use? Eh! Wrong answer. Minus 10 points for Jessica Clarke. I have no idea. You're a smart girl. Think about it. I actually have a paper I have to do by tomorrow. You know, I think we should get to know each other better. Look you don't have to run away from me. I won't bite. I'm sorry. I have to go. Hey ladies, what's up? I'm looking for this guy, Cassidy Clarke. Have you seen him? Sorry, I haven't seen him. That's his sister right there. That blond girl. Do you know where your brother is? Sorry, I haven't seen him all day. Do you have any idea where he's at? I'm sorry, no. Are you a student here? Do you know when he's going to come back? Just call security, Michael! Michael, are you OK? So, you never told me what the occasion is. There's no occasion. It's just-- I've been preoccupied lately, and I figured you deserved it. Do you think you deserve it? I don't know. You tell me. Cass, I'm so glad we're here. I thought I was losing you. Hey, don't say that. I was getting desperate. I thought I was going to have to knock on your door dressed in Saran Wrap. Mm, that wouldn't have been too bad. Hold that thought. OK. I'll be right back. Come on, come on. Let it be a pure, authentic, sexual experience. Open your mind. Your sister's life may depend on it. OK. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. I have something important I have to do. Important? I'm sorry. Cassidy, if you walk out that door, don't call me again. Yeah? Hi. You probably didn't expect to hear from me. You must've heard what went down on campus today. Wait a minute, you were up on campus? Look man, I don't have time for your bullshit, all right? Wait, wait, please, just don't hang up. Have you got my money, or not? I, uh-- I want to see you again. After all the bullshit you pulled the last time you was here? Look, I'll pay the money I owe you from the first time, plus double the price this time, all up front. No I don't know, man. You that hard up? Please. I-- I have to do this. I want to do this. You're not going to be all like, this just isn't me, and start that bullshit again with me, are you? No. I always got off on you first-timers. Yeah, so can I-- can I come over now? Yeah, I guess that'll work. All right. Wow, it's all here. I'm surprised. - Why? What, you thought I was going to scam you? I've seen it all, I've heard it all, shit happens. So you really take a chance letting strangers into your apartment. Better than flipping burgers. Look, about the other night that I-- Shh, forget it. We all got our baggage to deal with. I see it all the time. Been through it, myself. Actions speak louder than words. Friend like a sister in calm or stormy weather. Michael. Fuck! OK. OK. Michael. Kind of dressy for a study date. Well, we're not going to the library. We're going somewhere else. He won't tell me where. I think you like him. No, I just think he's sweet. I don't know, maybe it's like a date or something. Well, I've seen the way he looks at you. There's definitely something going on. So where do you think we'll go? Probably to the gym. No, it's a good thing! I hear he takes all the girls he likes to the gym. He has all access, and thinks it's romantic, or something. Speak of the devil! Hello there, Ann. You're looking lovely this evening. Right. Wow. You-- you look incredible. Thanks. So, you ready to go? Yeah, yeah, but I have something for you, first. It's a-- it's a college bowl question I-- I thought you'd like. It ends with the praise of sisterhood, including the lines, for there is no friend like a sister in calm or stormy weather. Now, it was viewed as a children's work, despite the lines, "She sucked, and sucked, and sucked the more fruits which that unknown orchard bore. She sucked until her lips were sore." Name this work, centered around the encounter between the sisters Lore and Lizzie, and the title creatures-- the most famous poem of Christina Rossetti. Goblin Market. Damn. You're good. Oh, come on. Fuck! Fuck! I guess you're wondering where we're going? Well, I am curious. You know, I work at the gym, so-- I do have full access, day and night. It's quiet, it's private. Sometimes I go there to study, you know? I usually don't bring anybody with me, but uh-- only people that are very special. Well, I'm glad you're asking me. Jessica! Jessica! Hi, Cassidy. Jessica's not here. She's studying with Michael. The library, thanks. Actually, I'm pretty sure they're at the gym. This goddamn lock always gives me trouble. You got that? Goddamn lock always gives me trouble. I didn't know they had sauna in here. Yeah, it's cosy. It's like a-- like a log cabin in the middle of the city. Well, I'm glad that you brought me here. Since the moment I first saw you, I knew you were my kind of girl. I like you, too, Michael. Since the moment I first saw you, I knew that you were my kind of girl. Well, I like you, too, Michael. Get the fuck off her! What did I fucking tell you, huh? What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you-- No, Michael, no! No! No, Michael, no! Michael, no! No! No! No! No, Michael, no! No! Michael, no! No, Michael! No! No, Michael! Come here, let me help you up. No, Michael! Jessica! - No, Michael, no! - Move, move! I told you to stay away from her, you psycho! I told you, stay away from her, you psycho! Oh, god! Hey, Jess, how you feeling? Yeah, that's what they said. Sorry you had to miss Cassidy's funeral. It went, you know, smoothly. I think he would have approved. Things get pretty crazy on campus, but we all miss you. Well, I guess I should let you rest. They said they'd call me if you wake up or freak out or something. Bye. Hi, Jess. I didn't know if I should actually come and see you. But I figured I owed you that much. Been trying to get away from it all, but it's been-- it's been kind of tough. God, you're beautiful. I guess I should go. I hear the rock song, to some song it keeps reminding on the radio. Right now, it's my soul that's playing on the radio. Oh. You asked me to remind you because you knew that I'd forget. But now that you're all over the FM, I never will ever forget my bet. Look where we've gone-- I hear the rock song, to some song keep reminding of the radio. Because right now it's my soul that's playing on the radio.
