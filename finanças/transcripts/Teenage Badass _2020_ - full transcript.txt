You said it like that's what you fuckin' meant, like I'm not as important as him. Well, do you do anything other than play drums? I do lots of things, I introduce people to people, I introduced you to Kirk, you wouldn't even know that motherfucker if it wasn't for me. Thank you dude. - I introduced you to Kirk. - Thank you. - Was it you? - It was me. No. You introduced me to Kirk, I introduced Mark to Kirk.

Cool, so it's me and this guy Kirk, he's our lead singer, bass player, songwriter, you know Kirk? Yeah, I know him. I mean, I don't know him personally, but I know of him, I love his stuff, yeah. Cool, so about Saturday, it's this bullshit local thing, but if you win they let you play a song on the news, you should hear this fucking song we have man, it's insane. I'm gonna text you directions, but if I can have easy, you should probably head over now, and yeah... (SPEAKER DROWNED OUT BY CROWD CHEERING) Hello? Yeah yeah yeah, sorry, text me the address, I'm on my way right now. AL ON PHONE: All right. (CROWD CHEERING) (TOY SLAPPING) Ah, when is this kid gonna get here? I'm so bored. Oh shit, you know what I just remembered? What? That Morgan whatever the fuck, his brother was in that band Garbageface, he plays the drums. Garbageface, great name. Yeah, call him. Are you guys talkin' about Ritner? Ritner. That's his name. Strange name. Oh, I know that guy. I mean, my opinion, Brad's a way better drummer, there were no drums in Garbageface. True, but Ritner knows people. Well, I mean, who can get here first? (PHONE VIBRATING) Yo, I'm on my way. Oh excellent. Yo yo yo, oh shit, oh shit. Brad, hold on. Sorry, Tiffany talked to Ritner, Kirk says first come, first play. Okay, so Brad, little change of plans, I guess there's another drummer in the mix, Kirk's sayin' first come first play, but I'm pullin' for you, bro. Oof. Okay, do you have the keys? We gotta go, he said there's another drummer. In my purse, you know, I don't like this two drummers thing, they called you first... Mom, where's your purse? It's on the floor behind me, honey, I can't twist around. BRAD: I don't have time for this. Well, where is this place? It's in Tempe, it's not far. Okay, and who are these guys? What do you know about them? (CAR ENGINE STALLING) You gotta be fucking kidding me. What, did I leave the lights on again? I don't know, it's just not fucking starting! Okay, language, please, why the rush? Kirk said first come first play. And who is Kirk? Who's Kirk? What are you? Mom, hold on. Okay, you can just fix cars now? All right. Fucking bitch. Me? No, not you. This is what I don't like about the cursin', you don't know if you're talkin' to me, or the car, and now... What the fuck? I'm gonna call Triple A. Mom, Triple A could take a fucking hour. What do you want? I don't know, I don' know, it's not even about talent, it's about who's fucking car starts. Okay sweetheart, what do you even know about this band? Honey... I'm done mom, I'm done, I can't do it, it's another band, another waste of fucking time. Sweetie, you're too hard on yourself, and you're usin' the F word like every sentence... Mom, people cuss when no other words will suffice... That's a great word, suffice is a great word. Okay, what about someone like Christopher Cross? I don't even know who that is. Five time Grammy award winner Christopher Cross. Okay, okay, well, I mean, obviously, he's great. I have his CD, you can listen to it, I used to have all of his... Mom mom, what are you even talking about right now? Sorry, okay, my point is, you're not the first person who's car didn't start, okay? The people who make it are the ones that make it happen, car or no car, despite getting stranded... Okay, okay okay. I'm gonna be in my 20s, living with my mom, cleaning fucking Howard's piss. Okay, why not just Howard's piss? Why F word, Howard's piss? What word won't suffice? It's words won't suffice, not a word won't suffice. MOM: I don't think that's right... - Yes it is. - No. Okay, I know someone who had to make it happen, guess. Mom, I don't know, Christopher Cross? I don't know. Not Christopher Cross, your dad. Daddy always made it happen, no matter what. (INTENSE ORGAN MUSIC) Hey, what's up guys? TIFFANY: Oh fuck. Hey, what's up Al? AL: Hey bud.

No, the other band I'm lookin' at right now, yeah. Baby. Oh, our band name is... Glad Fan. - No. - Nope. No. The Moody Boys. Ew, no. The Glad Fans, plural? You already said that. Just one, Shtibe, one each. My bad. KIRK: Brad, it's your turn. Um, the Bangers? No. Brad, that's literally the worst thing I've ever heard. AL: I don't hate it. Does your bong have a name? Okay, shut the fuck up, Al, go. Pass. CANDICE: That's not how that works. Ken Rippy Jr. What? Ken Rippy Jr. I love that. Do you have somethin', dude, just say it. Okay, fuck, Generation Smoke. Oh, Jesus Christ. (EVERYONE LAUGHING) Fuck you guys. That's so bad, that's so bad, Al. I don't hear you comin' up with anything better. Okay, well don't embarrass yourself, man.

Computer. Where did you come up with that? Yeah, that can actually be really cool on a T shirt, in "Predator" font or somethin'? Fuckin' "Predator" font, yes, "Predator" font. Did you know that was originally title Hunter, and it didn't change to "Predator" until after principal photography? ALL: No. Okay, Permafrost, hey, is everybody listening? ALL: Yes. Okay, meaning a thick sub-surface layer of soil that remains frozen throughout the year, occurring chiefly in polar regions. Regions, sorry. All right, the only other hit I got for Permafrost was a hybrid strain of icky fuckin' sticky. Nice. Except I don't smoke anymore, because Rachel doesn't like when I smoke, so I quit. What? Since when? I don't really feel like it's a safe environment to share. Oh my god. KIRK: Stop bein' so fuckin' stupid, it's the no drugs? I'm married okay? We know you're married, Mark. Well, then you know, occasionally, albeit not often, you have to make sacrifices for the covenant of marriage. Uh, stupid. (ALL LAUGHING) Occasionally. Whatever, it's just one less mouth to feed to me, so. But seriously, Permafrost is so fucking tight. Dude, thank you, thank you. I vote yes. KIRK: Yeah? Same. Okay, so our band name... Whoa whoa whoa, guys, we're fucking Permafrost. (BELL CHIMING) (ALL CHEERING) Permafrost. Yes, yeah, I love it! Our band name is Stylo and the Murder Dogs. SOUND GUY: How do you spell that? S-T-Y-L-O, as in Stylo, murder as in blood and dogs as in fuckin' pugs. Great. Bro, he changed the name of the band right in front of our eyes as a test for you, man. For me? Yeah, he's testin' your loyalty to the band, bro. Oh shit, you're right. You gotta close him, dude, cig? BRAD: So how exactly do I do that? Well, everyone wants to be in his band, you know? You saw fucking Ritner, we are all replaceable, Kirk is only taking the committed. Right, so he changed the band name to see if I was committed enough to call him out for it. Exactly, to prove that you wanna be in this band, officially. This is great, because I overheard Kirk and Candice talking about Ritner, and I just... No no no, fuck fucking Ritner, don't even think about Ritner, right now you need to concentrate on proving your loyalty to Kirk, you know? Yeah, dude, thank you so much, I literally had zero idea Kirk was operating on this kinda intellectual level. AL: Yeah. Is that fucked up? Well, I've learned to never underestimate the power of prescription medication, my friend. AL: Marky. Hey. AL: Is your wife comin' tonight? Nope, she's gotta work in the mornin', so you know what that means. (MARK HISSING) Oh, you're gonna smoke some weed about it. No, it was a drinking reference, we're gonna drink. AL: Oh. Hey, excuse me, Kirk? (CANDICE LAUGHING) Hey, Kirk? Hey, Kirk man, sorry. What's up? Well I noticed that we, or that you, didn't say Permafrost when the guy asked for our band name. KIRK: MmmHmm. BRAD: Is that... CANDICE: He's talking about Stylo and the Murder Dogs, babe. Oh, I changed the name. CANDICE: It's so fucking sick. Okay, that's cool. KIRK: I changed the name. What's Stylo? - It's my last name. - It's his last name, Brad. Oh right, yeah, I knew that. Pursely didn't love Permafrost, so. Rachel's gonna think we're not serious if we keep changin' the name, dude. What? I'm just processing that out loud. Mark's high. No, Mark's drunk. Okay, so the new new band name is Stylo and the Murder Dogs, then? Kirk Slasher Cats. (BRAD AND MARK LAUGHING) Ha ha, it's that funny, dude? Is that a joke to you, the band name's a joke? No no, I think it's cool. Fuck it. Guys, we're Stylo and the fucking Murder Dogs. (BELL CHIMING) Yeah, fuck Permafrost.

Oh hey. - Hi. - Hey, have we met before? Ha ha (LAUGHS), I would say come in, but we literally just closed. Oh no, really? I was just about to come in. I was just comin' in, and I was gonna see if you were here, actually. Oh really, well it's perfect timing, 'cause I just got off. Oh nice, yeah, well I'm gonna smoke a cigarette. MELANIE: Oh, you smoke now? Yeah, I grew up smoking. Oh, got it, okay. (LIGHTER FLICKING) (MELANIE LAUGHING) How was the news, by the way? (BRAD HUMMING) Thank you. It was amazing, (COUGHS), did you watch? I didn't, but Candice had six different people recording it in all different place, so. Sounds about right. Yeah, yeah. BRAD: As she should. Yeah, I'll be sure to let you know what I think when I watch it. Yeah, well what if you don't like it? What if you think we suck or somethin'? Well then I would have to tell you. BRAD: Really, you'd just shoot me that straight? Of course. Okay. Do you wanna go hang out right now? Yeah, yeah, right now? Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Welcome to my contingency van. Oh wow. Contingency van? Yes, for apocalyptic scenarios, like zombie infestation, contagion, extra-terrestrial or chemical war. This van would serve as my home. BRAD: Okay. It's also where I get black-out drunk with my friends. (BRAD LAUGHING) Double okay. (BRIGHT ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Evvy. Hey, Kirk Towns, yeah. Stylo and the Murder Dogs, my friend, good to meet you. I'm Brad, nice to meet you. Mark. All right, stay by me, all right? Right this way, okay, come on, don't be shy. (HAPPY ROCK MUSIC) You guys want any coffee, or booze? Oh yeah, I'll take some booze. Yeah, maybe a six pack of Red Stripe? I'm down. Yeah, actually make that two six packs. Spoken like a true drummer. How old are you? - He's 21. - He's 21. 21. Okay. (SOUND MIXER WHISTLING) - You whistled for me? - Hey, Buddy, everybody, this is Buddy. INTERN: My name's not Buddy. Hey Buddy. No one really gives a fuck what your name is, you just need to bust you butt down to the corner store, get these gentlemen a 24 pack of PBR, you guys cool with PBR? Yeah. Kay, bye Buddy. Dust in the attic. Hey, do you have any cash? Where was I? Where was I? We were talkin' about you letting us record our EP here, for free. Check out the big brain on Brad. Bring out the gimp. That's from Pulp Fiction. Here's how I see it, Radiohead had "Creep," Beck had "Loser," Stylo and the Murder Dogs have "Deep Freeze." What's in it for you? Brad again. When you guys blow the fuck up, and it comes time to record that much anticipated full length record, make it here. We don't need to sign anything? Look, the truth is, you guys should really be signing a contract with each other, I don't know if you know anything about bands, but you motherfuckers eat each other. So it doesn't have to be anything complicated, somethin' simple, that says who owns what, who does what... No, how 'bout this, we'll just pay? Okay? I mean, if you insist... I insist, dude... Hey dude, why don't we just take this nice man up on his offer, and we'll come back and record our full length... - No, you don't get it... - If we want to. He's not even gonna make us stay. No, fuck that, dude, no. Okay, could we have a second? Sure. No no, nope, nope, I don't, no no, I don't need a second, I don't need a second, because I wanna pay this man for his time, all right? No strings attached. No strings, look, if you don't wanna make your first record here, that's fine. But I'm telling you, once you hear those songs, your songs on that fuckin' tape machine, you're gonna be circling back here like a suckling pig to its mother's tit. Listen, baby, I know the game, okay? But I'd rather pay for my milk. Dude. No, I'd rather pay for the milk. AL: Just sit down... I'd rather pay for the milk. - Come on. - Pay for the milk? SOUND MIXER: It's okay. Look, let's go talk to him. - KIRK: Fuck that. - BRAD: We'll be right back. KIRK: Dude, you don't get hurt. I don't understand, why don't we just record with that guy? Yeah, where are we gonna get the money, Kirk? Yeah man, unless you got some rich uncle that we don't know about, I suggest you step off the Kirk express, and we record some fucking songs, man. Do you ever fucking think that it's not about the god damned money. Hey, how'd it go? What the fuck, what happened? What, I leave for two seconds, this is what happens? No, the guy in there is awesome, and he wants to record us. For free, just wants us to record a full length with him if we like the way the EP sounds. And not even make us sign anything. Okay, well what did Kirk say? Nothing, he was just like... KIRK: You fuckin' shits talkin' shit on me? No. Babe, you wanna talk to us, or? KIRK: This guy stinks of high treason. How? KIRK: The first thing he brings up is a fucking contract. We're a family, what more of a contract is there? Dude, how long have you known me, bro? Uh, eight years. 10 whole years, man, 10 years. We're family. I want you to hear me say it now, you can trust me, okay? You can trust me. (BELL DINGING) Quack, quack, quack, ALL: Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack! Can we go, please? Yep. KIRK: Oh shit, nice. Oh yeah. You guys feel that hot hot heat? Yeah, it's a little hot. Who wants to try? - I'll go. - I'll go. You go. - Are you sure? - GOLFER: That's the spirit. I'll go after you. All right. So Kirk tells me you guys played on the news, huh? - AL: Yup. - BRAD: Yes. (BALL PINGING) Fuck. What's wrong, you've never seen a factory pre-roll before? What's a factory pre-roll? Come on Kirk! I get these pre-rolled joints from an old fuck buddy in the LBC. Ooh, yeah, sorry, I promised the Mrs., yeah, but it was my decision, too. Are you guys all married? Just Mark, I'll hit that, thank you. We talked about it together, so. (CLUB PINGING) Ah, yes! I gotta get this, go for Everett. Hey Albert, can I hit that? Yeah. Come on Kirk. KIRK: Hey, can I touch your balls, bro? EVERETT: Fuck outta here, go, go! KIRK: Touch your balls, ow, fuck, you hurt my arm! Hey hey, so how much we talkin' here? Fuck, I'm thinkin' 5,000 for the record, 10,000 for the video, and maybe another 5,000 for the merch? What'd he say? I don't know, man, that sounds like way too much. Yeah, I feel like 10's probably fine. 10 it is. AL: Okay then. (KIRK YELLING) Dude, you and the fuckin' new guy... BRAD: Chill out, dude! Fucked up my negotiation tactics! MARK: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. AL: Oh, your fuckin' negotiation tactics, huh? New guy? I couldn't hear shit ridin' bitch. We had 20 Gs, Stibe. He was gonna give us 20 Gs, and then you needle dick bitches fuckin' undercut my position, dude, undercut me. Okay, we undercut your position. All I'm saying is, do you really think we need to borrow 20 thousand dollars? You don't know what I'm conjuring, dude. - Kirk. - You don't know. At the end of the day, the more money we borrow, the more money we have to pay back. We don't even have an EP worth of songs. Dude, I have millions of songs, dude, in my head, what are you talking about? I'm not doubting you, okay? Did it seem like I was doubting him? Because I'm not. By the way, Mark, you're out of the band. - Whoa. - What, dude. What the actual fuck did I even do? Dude, you can't just oh I forgot someone out of the fucking band, this isn't China. Is this another round of tests? Dude, it's not up to me. ALL: Yes it is! (DOORS OPENING) (KIRK GRUNTING) Hang back. (CHAIN RATTLING) What's the key's guy's name? KIRK: Oh, that's Mark. His energy fuckin' blows, get rid of him. Really? No married dudes, that's not the vibe. He's got the worst stylistic identity, man. Yeah, yeah, then who shall play keys? I got the perfect guy, Horus Slays. I mean, yeah, you gotta pay his day rate and all that stuff, but the music industry is do or die, man. KIRK: Yeah. EVERETT: Look at Mark, looks like a fuckin' homeless hillbilly, chained down by faux marital bliss. KIRK: Yeah, I could see that. It's in my eye, oh god, oh god. Did I ever tell you what the manager for Linkin Park once told me? I don't know. He said a rockstar is someone that girls wanna fuck, and the dudes wanna be. And before Stylo and the Murder Dogs blows the fuck up, you need to keep all those music rights to yourself, all right? Have all these greasy bums out here sign NDAs and non-competes. And if any of them give you any guff, you just replace 'em, with guys just like Horus motherfuckin' Slays. KIRK: A band full of keyboard players, man, that's... No, no, independent contractors. Right, right. And you came up with the name? Yeah, well me and Candice. Not a question. Right, right. He wants me out of the band? AL: The hell's wrong with you, man? It's just business. Why do we need this golfer prick? Producer guy's offering to do it for free. Yeah, I thought we didn't care about the money. I don't care about the money, dude, I have a bigger picture for this band. Do you not get that? I'm talkin' merch, I'm talkin' videos, international tours, cool art projects, whatever... Kirk, we get that, but what happens when a label's like "Drop the band," then what? He doesn't even wanna be in the band. Yes I do... KIRK: Admit it! Yes I do, I do. News flash, you're married, Shtibe. You're probably already thinking about leaving the band. Are you fuckin' marriage shaming me, bro? Yeah, I'm fuckin' marriage shaming you, dude, Rachel, think about Rachel. So you really think that Rachel's just hunky dory with you goin' out on tour with the boys, and smashin' beers, and she's just chillin at home, sitting at a dining table all by herself, eating a meal, and when she's like "Oh, where's Shtibe?" Yeah, sounds fun. I knew it dude, I know. Mark? What, it maybe'd crossed my mind. - Oh my gosh, dude. - Mark. What? I thought she would come around, you know, when she heard how good we are. She hasn't come around? It's been really hard to get her to come around lately. All right, well my vote is, if Mark could give us his word that he's gonna be committed to trying new techniques to get her to come around, then fuck golfer prick, we don't need his money, let's record for free with producer guy. No no no, no dude, you're not thinking big enough, you're not thinking big enough. No, I agree with Brad. Fine, if he can commit. Fine. Mark, can you eternally commit to being a Murder Dog, and nothing but a fucking Murder Dog, so help you God? Kirk's right! Oh my god. - I knew it! - AL: Come on, man! I can only commit to one thing, Rachel. - Mark. - Mark. But you know what? I would be honored to be replaced by Horus fucking Slays. You know Horus Slays? Yeah, he used to play with the Master Baits, constantly. Whoa, that's tight. We love you, man. I love you guys. Come here, man. KIRK: We love you, Shtibe, I mean. I mean, you're doing the right thing, Stibe. I know. KIRK: You're doin' the right thing. I know I am. (EXCITING ROCK MUSIC) CANDICE: Sky, Kirk has to be in the middle. (ALL TALKING OVER EACH OTHER) Sorry, who the fuck are you? HORUS: My name is Horus, Horus Slays. CANDICE: Oh, right, right. HORUS: Lookin' for Stylo and the Murder Dogs. CANDICE: Yeah, guys, this is Horus Slays. Oh, what's goin' on man? The boys, Stylo and the Murder Dogs. AL: Albert. HORUS: Horus Slays. Let's get you in an outfit, thank you so much for coming. (EXCITING ROCK MUSIC) CANDICE: All right, hey, let's focus, okay. No, no, no. - Oh! - AL: Yeah, that one. Oh yeah! No. AL: Oh shit. Yes, this is it, this is it. KIRK: That's iconic, dude. HORUS: That's gorgeous. Hi, I just need to do a couple things differently... Hi. Yeah, and I think this is the take. I think so too. Yeah, you do? Yeah, yeah. Fuck yes, I mean, even if you didn't, I would still say this one. I know you would. - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. (EXCITING ROCK MUSIC) - KIRK: Yo. - AL: Yo. KIRK: Shot town, to you, boys! (AL YELLING) Oh, tees, tees! Oh, check this. What? Baby lemme see, lemme see, lemme see! Oh, those are fucking great. (SPEAKERS DROWNED OUT BY MUSIC) Well, if you haven't been, we should go tomorrow. We should, but I can't tomorrow night, can you do lunch? Oh, we can't, we're meeting with this A&R guy. Really? Yeah, Kirk's showin' him some more songs. That's epic. You have to knock on wood now. What do you mean? When you say the E word you have to knock on wood. What, epic? Now you have to knock twice. Okay. (MELANIE KNOCKING) (BRAD LAUGHING) Ignore them. MELANIE: What are they doing? Please ignore them. Oh my god. They're being dumb. Well what about the night after? Um, actually, my parents are coming into town, so I have to play tourist with them for a little bit. I should meet them. Right? Um. Maybe not? Did I just make it weird? No, I just, I mean, isn't it a little fast to meet my parents? Yeah, absolutely, sorry. No, I mean, you can meet them if you want to. Really? They're actually really great. So it would be weird, or it wouldn't be weird? Fuck it, it's not weird. (GROOVY ROCK MUSIC) A&R GUY: So how many songs have you tracked so far? BRAD: Three so far. A&R GUY: Three songs? Nice. SOUND MIXER: First time in the history of mankind that a band shows up before me. There he is. There he is, there he is, you look like Avril fuckin' Lavine. Well you look like my gay fuckin' uncle. (BOTH LAUGHING) Good to see you, Jordan. I was tellin' your boys, I'm actually through on my way to South By. JORDAN: Is this February already? A&R GUY: I go out early, you know? Calm before the storm. Yeah, yeah, takin' the airstream? Hell yeah. Yeah. So we gonna hear some music? JORDAN: Yeah, are we gonna hear some music? Yeah, yeah. A&R GUY: Cool. Yeah, oh yeah, where's Kirk? He's on his way, yeah. I'm sorry, I gotta take this, excuse me. - Oh yeah, yeah... - I'll be back, guys, yeah? What the god damned hell is goin' on here? We lost Kirk. You lost Kirk? Like a little kid in the mall? Go find him. We've been trying to call Candice, but she's not answering, and my phone's about to die. Yeah, I mean, why can't we just send this guy an MP3 when we find Kirk? I mean, what's the rush? Phone's about to die, what's the rush? What are you talkin'? South by Southwest is the biggest festival in the world for unsigned bands, we want this guy to sign the Murder Dogs, no matter what other bands he sees. Yeah, we know what South By is. Listen baby, y'all gotta chill out on all this stress, there's more than one fuckin' A&R guy. Kirk just does this shit sometimes, it's really not a big deal, we'll get the next one. You guys are killin' me, all right? What are you talkin' about? How old are you? Tell me, I wanna hear it, how old are you? I'm 22. - 22. - Yeah. Well you're gonna learn really quickly in life, there's no guarantee there's gonna be a next time. When you get a shot at somethin', like you got right now, you gotta make it happen. We'll find him. We'll find him. Yeah. Guys, let's go, why are we sitting here? Let's go find him. Yeah, I'm fine. He's probably fucked up somewhere random or some shit, so we'll split up. Look, check yourself, Kirk paid me through the week, so technically I'm yours until 11 PM, so I'll help out. Great. SOUND MIXER: Now we're fucked. BRAD: I gotta run home and get my phone charger. Find that kid, man. BRAD: Godspeed. All right, I'm gonna try to buy us some time. Listen to me, Kirk's goin' through some super fucked up incestuous family emergency right now. Oh no, incestuous? He's really stepping up, I'm proud to call him my friend. I'd share the details with you, but he's asked us to keep it confidential. Yeah, I understand, that's terrible. If you could stick around through the weekend. The weekend, I don't think I can. You have 'til technically Thursday. Bro, just send me the fuckin' MP3s once they track more tunes. I'm not sayin' no. All right, all right, I'm just sayin, we both know you're gonna be seein' a whole fuck load of bands, if you stick around through the weekend, I'll cut you Kirk's songs, you could listen to them on the road trip. By the time you're rolling into Austin, you're gonna have one group on your mind, Stylo and the fuckin' Murder Dogs. My pops would love if I stayed the weekend. Exactly, exactly, you look out for your family, Kirk looks out for his family. All right, you got it Jordan. All right Chad, all right, man. (INTENSE ROCK MUSIC) MAN IN HAT: This girl was so fucking ugly, and I'm hearin' (SPEAKER DROWNED OUT BY MUSIC) What the fuck is your problem? Fuck you! Oh, you fucker! KIRK: No, fuck you! Hi hon. Shit's hit the fan. MOM: Sorry. Kirk's been missing, my phone's about to die. Are you gonna eat here? MmmMmm, I'm not gonna be home until I find him, you all right? Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Make sure you get food. (MOM GRUNTING) (ITEMS CLATTERING) BRAD: Hey mom, have you seen my phone charger? It was on my bedside table. I don't know, sweetheart. (PHONE BEEPING) Oh shit. (DISH CLATTERING) Mom, are you okay? - MOM: No. - Mom! Mom, what happened? Okay, I just need to get on the ground. Kay, go slow, go slow, go slow. (DOORS CLOSING) Hey, which hospital? EMT: St. Luke's on Mill. All right, I'm followin' you. (ENGINE STARTING) (MELANCHOLY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) No way. Kirk! (KIRK COUGHING) BRAD: Dude, what the fuck? Dude, Kirk, where have you been? (KIRK GRUNTING) Where the fuck have you been? Get in the car, get in! (KIRK BURPING) Put this down, what is that? Why the fuck are you at a hospital? (MELANCHOLY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) God damn it, Kirk! What the fuck? Get ahold of yourself, man, fuck! (KIRK GRUNTING) (MELANCHOLY ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (BRAD CRYING) So the deal is, Kirk and Candice broke up. Full blown Yoko. TIFFANY: Yoko? It means we're fucked. Candice was his first real girlfriend. Oh, and all the songs were about her, I just realized that. That makes sense, why all these songs are so fuckin' good. They're precious to him. Hey man, it's past 11, we can't afford to keep payin' you. No, you know what? I already put a lot of time and energy I can't get back, so I'm already emotionally invested up in this bitch. If you don't mind me askin', how long were they together? Three years, she took his virginity. AL: In Silver Lake. Wait, Kirk lost his virginity three years ago? Isn't he in his 20s? Oh my god, you guys, why did you care when people lose their virginity? I mean, it's not true, okay, if you don't use it, you lose it... Hey, hey hey hey, ho, hey, of the recent revelations, your being a virgin is the least interesting, and the most predictable. Now run along, like a good little virgin, and get the adults some hard liquor. It's gonna be an all nighter. Stops! INTERN: Well I'm not... Get the fuck out! Somebody need to get that little munchkin a prostitute. (ALL LAUGHING) I got the A&R guy to postpone his trip. Oh, awesome. Do we know who broke up with who? He said she left him for some rich golfer guy, or somethin'? BOTH: Golfer prick? (GLASS SHUFFLING) (MELANCHOLY FLUTE MUSIC) MELANIE VOICEMAIL: Hey, it's me, don't leave a message, just come and get a drink. (PHONE BEEPING) (GLASS PILING) Coke me. BRAD: One, two, three, (ALL CLAPPING) (KIRK SNIFFING) Holy, chug a bean! Hey bud, it's me, your pal Al, just tryin' to get a ballpark on your sobriety, so that our band can get signed. Oh, did we finish the tour? God. We didn't go on tour. Hey Kirk, hey, it's me, Brad. We're here to help you. AL: He's just super fucked up. You gotta choose to come back from that level of fucked up. Y'all should probably try to get his Stephan Hawking lookin' ass up. BRAD: Okay, come on. HORUS: I aint touchin' that shit. BRAD: Come on, oh there you go, hey, we're running out of time. I can't. BRAD: Huh? I can't go. You can't go? No one knows what the fuck you're talkin' about, dude. BRAD: Hey, Kirk, you just gotta let us know what you need because this A&R guy is... AL: Yeah, time is of the essence, here. KIRK: Oh, Evan's essence. Oh boy, okay. Kirk, listen up, little nigga, I aint with all this Rick James shit, all right? You only paid me through last night, which means you'd better sober the fuck up, or imma bounce, and this Murder Dog shit aint goin' nowhere. Okay okay okay, hey Kirk, it's Brad again. KIRK: Dad? No, Brad. If you love her so much, why don't you just get back together with her? Back together? Yeah, why don't you just forgive the affair, and go after your one true love? True love? Oh my god. Yeah, get that love, Kirk. Yeah dude, for the sake of the band, get back together with Candice, you fickle bastard! Yeah, why don't you ask her hand in marriage? AL: Yeah, marry her, marry her! ALL: Marry her, marry her, marry her, marry her, marry her! (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) BOUNCER: There's a guy out here who says his mom fell or some shit? What? BOUNCER: There's a guy outside asking for you. Then let him in. BOUNCER: He's underage. What, he's 17? - BOUNCER: What? - Let him in! Melanie, I'm sorry. My phone died, my mom's in the hospital, Kirk has gone off the walls... Prove it. BRAD: Prove what? Any of it. How am I supposed to prove it? Oh, fuck off, dude, I've dated musicians before. One minute you're in town, the next you're not, I'm not down. I'm not like that, if anyone's been fucked by more musicians, it's me. Do you really just expect me to believe that you're the one musician who's different from all the rest of them? Yeah, maybe, I'm not saying I'm better than them, but I think I've been fucked over so many times I've learned not to treat people like that. Come to hospital with me. Is she really in the hospital? Yes, come with me, please. You're awake. I feel good. Wait, wait, easy, but hug me, oh. You look skinny, have you eaten? BRAD: Nothin'. Who is that? That's Melanie. MOM: Hi, are you the girlfriend? (MELANIE LAUGHING) Yeah. (MOM LAUGHING) - Just, maybe. - Come on in. Honestly, I think this all happened for a reason. Okay, so you and I will make sure that golfer prick is neutralized, and that Candice makes it out to the front yard. HORUS: Right on. And I'm gonna be with Kirk for the grand finale. Do you wanna tell us exactly what it is you're planning to do, Kirk? Oh, I know exactly what me and Brad will do, just get her out to the front, I'll get her back. All right, Gordon Bombay on three, one, two. ALL: Gordon Bombay! Who the fuck is Gordon Bombay? Brad, can you go silent, over. BRAD ON RADIO: Copy you, over. Horus, you there, over. HORUS ON RADIO: What's poppin', over. Is it weird that I am super pumped that this plan involves scarin' the living shit out of Candice? Over. Yo, I'm definitely diggin' this plan, over. Hey, what's up chief? Mr. Fisk. That's right. Wow, I am so glad that the universe put you and Kirk together, man. You're tellin' me, man. I'm a raging fan of Kirk's. Yeah, I've heard. Yeah. Thanks for the fan page. You saw the fan page? Yeah, it's great. It's great. Yeah, do you mind if we go over the plan? The plan, yeah, of course, you don't wanna talk about the fan page with me, no, that'd be crazy, huh? What am I thinking? Unless you did? Okay, the plan, you and Horus Slays will enter through the rear entry with these. You will then escort Ms. Candice White, (WHILE COUGHING) who's a bitch. Oh, bless you. Thank you, to the front yard, where Kirk Stylo will seduce her, and once again regain his god-tier status. I love this. I love Kirk. Kirk, you gotta fuckin' tell me... AL ON RADIO: Over to ground control, over. Copy that, over. Do not concede Kirk's secret stash of energy snort until you hear code red, once he's caked, we only got one shot at this, over. Where's my secret stash of energy snort? Hey man, it's gonna be okay. Hey, how much longer, over. I know you possess it. I repeat, how much longer, over. Horus, over. Oh shit, code red, code red. BRAD: I'm just unlocking it, okay? HORUS ON RADIO: Code red, code red. (BOTH YELLING) Starting the timer now. (EXCITING ROCK MUSIC) (MEN GRUNTING) (SPEAKERS DROWNED OUT BY MUSIC) Come into my house, fuck, get down. Who the fuck are you, huh? Mafia, cartel? IRS? Horus Slays? CANDICE: Get the fuck out!

Hey, I just wanna announce that, as reparations for me having non-sexual, but deeply intimate relations with Candice, while she was, in fact, with Kirk at the moment, I am releasing Stylo and the Murder Dogs from their $33,000 debt. AL: $33,000 debt? Shut the fuck up. If you don't get Kirk off this lawn and into rehab right fucking now, I swear to God I'm gonna call the cops, I really mean it. BRAD: Come on, man. Jesus Christ. BRAD: Let's go get you some help. (MELANCHOLY ORGAN MUSIC) KIRK FAN: You got it, Kirk. Let's get the fuck out of here. BRAD: Can you drive? KIRK FAN: Yeah, let's go Kirk. BRAD: Let's go. HORUS: You did what you could. (MELANCHOLY ROCK MUSIC) Hi. Kirk, I got a, Kirk. No, fuck off! (ALL YELLING) So now what? It's fuckin' over, isn't it? Well, best case scenario, Kirk actually sobers up. That's like, but then who the fuck is he? Kid's been pitted since junior high. How long does it take for someone to sober up? A few weeks? Sometimes you can't separate greatness from mobeus, man. Yo, I think this is where our ships cross in the night, fellas, I'm out. Best of luck to y'all, though. Don't forget, y'all talented without Kirk, so keep your heads up, all right? It's been good. All right, man. Stay up. (ORGAN PLAYING) If this Murder Dog shit ever do take off, I'll waive my day rate, plus I'm back in. Said they're gonna call us. Yeah, I left my number with her. Same. (AL SIGHING) Keep your head up, man. Hope your mom feels better. Thanks man. Let me know if you hear anything. Will do. (SOFT ROCK MUSIC) Somebody cleaned. Yep, where would you like to be, mom? On the couch, just right there. Oh here. Oh thanks, yep, I got it, I got it. I gotta take this. Yeah, of course I got it. Can I get you anything? No, I understand you have some kind of party van? Hello? Hello? Hello? BRAD ON PHONE: Jordan? Can you hear? Sorry, I have horrible service in my house, hey, can you hear me? Yes I can, I'm just callin' to see how you're doin', how everybody's doin'. How's your mom? Oh, she's doin' a lot better, we just got her home. Good to hear, any news on Kirk, anybody gone over to visit? BRAD ON PHONE: I guess he has to invite us or something, I don't really know. Oh, yeah, that's too bad. Well hopefully you'll be surprised at what comes out of the situation, you never know. All you can do is keep tryin' to make it happen. Yeah, that's what my mom keeps sayin'. We'll catch 'em next time, kid. BRAD ON PHONE: Yes we will, I'll let you know if I hear anything, all right? JORDAN ON PHONE: All right. Bye. What'd he say, how'd it go? Get your fuckin' hand off me. Yes, sorry.
