Or else I'll let everyone know what really happened. - Hello, this is Dr. Victoria Regina Phibes and I'm calling about Officer Linda Blair. The hero cop who murdered that serial killer. You don't understand. I know how traumatic an experience like this can be as a psychiatrist. And while I know there are some in-house services for things like this, I just wanted to throw my hat into the mix to see if I could help. That's what I thought you'd say. What if I put it this way, Clive Barker was a patient of mine, and 95 % of what we discussed was doctor/patient confidentiality, however, there's certain information that may fall outside of those lines that I could share with Officer Blair, and Officer Blair only. I don't think so, I'm sorry, sweetie. I have no patience and I hate waiting. Get her to meet me by tomorrow afternoon or the offer's off the table. You've got my name, look it up. - Hey, Chief. No, uh, I'm glad you called actually. There's something I've been needing to discuss with you. Yeah, it's about my time off. You know, I only got two days left, but, uh, I've just been doing a lot of thinking and I-- What? What kind of game are you playing? Dr. Phibes? - Well, I want to help you. By withholding evidence? Of a serial killer? - It was the only way I could get you to show up. Believe me, I feel a sense of responsibility for what Clive did. I had no idea he was capable of such actions. I tried to help him as best I could. - Well, if it's the same help that you're going to offer me, thanks, I'll pass. - If we could all bat one thousand, what a wonderful world this would be. You should know all too well, we can't save everyone. We're connected by the life and death of Clive Barker. I want to give us closure and a peace of mind. - Maybe you have some type of guilty conscience, but I'm fine. I'm great, in fact. I'm in better shape than I've been in in my entire life. I've read more in the past 10 days than I've read in the past 10 years. And, how have your nights been? You look like you haven't slept in days. - Well as the saying goes, I'll sleep when I'm dead. - Anxious, jittery, irritated, and trouble sleeping. Check, check, check, and check. Have you been having nightmares, vivid memories, flashbacks of killing Clive that make it seem like it's happening all over again? The tough cop act isn't going to help you here. Only by letting your guard down and being honest are you going to get past this. Unless, you want the rest of your life to feel like the last few weeks? I hope you don't mind us meeting in a hotel. It's a temporary situation. Just bought a house with space for a home office and until renovations are complete, this is the best I can do. - Oh, I'm glad to hear that your business is doing so well that you can afford a new home. And a fancy hotel in the interim. - Business is booming, Officer. And I plan on doing everything I can to keep it that way. If you're done playing inquisitive cop, you ready for me to do my job? - I'm all yours, doc. - You feel emotionally cut off from others, feeling numb, and losing interest in things you used to care about. Becoming depressed, becoming isolated. The only way to free yourself is to travel back to that night. I want you to look up and focus on the light. As you focus on it, I want you to tune everything out of your mind and focus only on my voice. Because you'll notice a change in focus in your eyes. Once you notice a change in focus in your eyes, I want you to go ahead and close your eyes. Now sleep. I want you to be completely relaxed. A rock with your body. Every muscle, every cell, every fiber should just completely melt and relax as you focus only on my voice. Every sound that you hear, every beat of your heart, every breath that you take, allows you to focus on my voice and go even deeper into a state of relaxation. Every time I say the word sleep, you'll go deeper into a state of relaxation. Nod your head yes if you understand me. I want you to take me back to that night. What happened? - I've never had to pull my gun in the field before. I told him to stop. But he wouldn't. So I shot him. And I could tell by looking at him he wasn't gonna hurt me, and I shot him anyway. 'Cause I was scared. - What did he say? It's important that you remember. What did he say? - He kept repeating, "She said it wasn't real. "She said it wasn't real! "I wouldn't have done it if I'd known it was real! "You believe me, don't you? "Please, help me, she said it wasn't real." - Did he say who she was? It's important that you remember. Did he say who she was? - Did she send you? Stop or I'll shoot! - You know the last one to kill me said that exact same thing? Except she had the safety off. - This isn't a fucking joke. - If it is, then the joke's on you, isn't it? Bang. I'm just kidding, what kind of person would I be to kill you with your own gun? Nope, I'm gonna give you a sporting chance. You can shoot all of this and I won't shoot you. - This much heroin will kill me. - Nah, that much heroin may kill you. This, on the other hand, will kill you. Your choice. - Did you sleep? - Yes. For the first time in weeks I actually got a full night's sleep. But I just had this horrible dream. I was seeing everything through the eyes of Clive and, I watched as he forced a woman to overdose. But I couldn't stop him, I couldn't help her. I'm just seeing everything through him but, it just, it felt so real. - This is all part of your PTSD. The point is, you're able to sleep now, which means we're making progress. This scenario wasn't real, it was all in your mind. Clive is dead. He was a bad person, you shouldn't feel guilty for killing bad people. It makes the world a better place.

That wound's real. Good thing for us, Rose isn't a good shot. Except if you count her aim close range and she's sticking the gun in her own mouth. Lucky for us, it was just a flesh wound. - Would you stop talking like we're two different people? We're the same person. We're the same person. Means that I killed those people. Oh god, oh, no. - You can't run from me, Linda. Our mind isn't split, it's shattered. Like a waking nightmare. We can either figure this thing out together or spend the rest of our life between the nut house and jail. - Okay, we have spun this thing every way possible and in every scenario I look like a total psychopath and Victoria walks, she'll probably get a book deal. - We're missing a motive. There has to be reason she wanted these people dead bad enough that after I died, and she was in the clear, she still took a chance to go out and recruit a cop. - Do you remember anything else about her locations? - The only memories I have are the ones Phibes implanted in you and the ones you've projected on me. - But maybe that's enough, though. Clive kept massive journals, just so much stuff that it's out of context when I'm reading it at the time, but, I don't know, maybe hidden in there somewhere is the answer to figuring it out. It's just the memories, they're deep in my subconscious. I can't remember anything. - Maybe they're with me. How do we know Phibes didn't just wipe them? - Well, I told her I've been doing a lot of reading, but I didn't mention that exclusively included the case file and your journals. - I guess there's only one way to know for sure. - Clive, why did you start going to Dr. Phibes in the first place? - I was an accountant in Arizona. I was to forced to relocate to New York because the software company I was working for merged with a larger firm. The move cost me my girlfriend and all of my friends. It also came with a lower salary. Then, I was constantly being asked to be creative with the bookkeeping, and passed up for promotions and raises. I was bitter, lonely, and angry. I started having vivid delusions of killing my boss and coworkers. That's when I went to Victoria for help. That's when the nightmares started. - Who'd you kill first? - An old lady, Janet Lee. I knew Janet, I liked her. But once I overheard her calling me motherfucking psycho, I wanted to stop her. I came up on her when she felt the most safe and the stabbed her over and over and over again. Victoria said it was okay, though, because it was only in my mind. - Wait, who was Janet? - She was Victoria's only other client at the time. - Well, maybe that's it then. Keep going, Clive, tell me everything you can remember. Hi, Wes? Oh, no, believe me. I'm actually thrilled to hear that you've moved on so quickly. Anyway, did you get the information for me? Okay, thank you, I gotta go. - What was that about? - It's complicated. - Any more complicated than this conversation you're having right now with yourself? - I suppose not. It's my ex, who also happens to be best friends with my father, and, you know, they're still friends, even though we broke up. - Sorry I asked. - Anyway, getting back on track. What I found out was the junkie she had us kill, her name was Jamie Lee. So, I'm judging by her surname and her age, she's probably a relative of Janet's. A niece, maybe even her daughter? - We make a hell of a team. - I know this isn't real right now, but I don't care. - It's as real as we want it to be. We're gonna do this now? - Not we, just me. - With me there, she can control your mind. I'm your one weakness. - I'm the one that comes to her, though. - If you take her in alive, we all go down. Is that the other reason you wanna leave me behind? - At the end of the day, I'm still a cop. - And a serial killer. ♪ On the hearse on the way to the graveyard ♪ ♪ I'm gonna carve around your body ♪ ♪ With a tune that's stone hard ♪ ♪ Pale hot skin, yeah, big ol' teeth ♪ ♪ The grave is a hole, can ya dig it, man ♪ ♪ My father was a gravedigger ♪ ♪ My mother was a con, I was born dead ♪ ♪ Born dead, I was born dead ♪ ♪ I was born dead, born dead, I was born dead ♪ ♪ Don't plan rolling on the crush of feels ♪ ♪ The zombies are looking for 10 inch heels ♪ - Linda? - You seem surprised to see me.

Why don't we check out that new home office of yours? ♪ My father was a gravedigger ♪ ♪ My mother was a con ♪ - Sleep. - I decided to leave Clive at home. I figured that this is between you and I. Why did you do this? - Money, why else? I still didn't pay off my college tuition and my business was going under. I had two patients, one kept telling me how much he wanted to kill, and the other had lived most of her life and had me in her will. - Then you had to keep going 'cause money, money is just numbers and, numbers, numbers never end. - I can't wait to see your defense team try to prove to a jury that while you slept at night, a serial killer who died by your hands took over your body and made you kill at my will. You're crazier than I thought you were. Arrest me, Officer. I'll make bail and be back at home in time for Corn Flakes. - Hello, Chief? Turns out that Dr. Phibes was behind the Clive Barker killings and four more recent deaths to cover her trail. Send some squad cars, and an ambulance. She was shot and killed during her apprehension. - You don't have this in you. That's why I had to create an alter ego. I mean, just knowing that you took a single life in self defense was enough to send you over the edge. How are you gonna live with knowing that you're killing someone in cold blood? - Do you really think that I would spend the rest of my life in prison for some fucked up sociopath that fucked with my head and made me take innocent lives? Do you think that my perception of justice is proving in a court of law that you are an insane sociopath, just so that you can have your lawyers, all with your blood money, bargain you down to a couple weeks jail time just so that you can come out and sign some Hollywood fantasy million dollar fucking book deal? I'm asking you, Dr. Phibes, which one of us in this room's truly insane? - If you think killing me is going to do some kind of good, you're sadly mistaken. I came from nothing to get to where I am today. So a few people were killed along the way. Fuck them! Do you have any idea of the evils that people admit to in this office? The atrocities that are allowed to go on in this world by the people at the top? I did what I had to and I have no regrets. You, you kill me, and you'll be haunted for the rest of your-- - You're a bad person. And I shouldn't feel guilty about killing bad people. It makes the world a better place. Now, doctor, into the light. - Detective Linda Blair. I like the sound of that. - And I couldn't have done it without you. - You do know the killings aren't going to stop. - I know. - Good. I say next on our list should be my former boss. 300 pound son-of-a-bitch. If we don't get him soon, his clogged arteries will. - No. - How 'bout a hooker? They never get missed and we could probably have a threesome before we kill her. - I was thinking we could be a little more discerning. My job enables me to enforce the law, but even that can only do so much when those in power hide behind it and corrupt it. A cop shoots an unarmed teenager, he gets a 30 day paid vacation. The GM executives, for decades they ignored complaints about faulty ignition switches, hundreds of people die, but no one goes to jail, no one gets charged, no one even loses their job. Or a priest molesting little boys and The Vatican just moves him from city to city, protecting him so he can keep doing it. There are people out there who think that because they're above the law, they can escape social justice. So I say we go out and find those people and we kill 'em. Here is a place of torment. A place occupied, they say, by half beings. A twilight world of spirits.
