My name is Steve Martin. I've lived in the West all my life. Somehow or other I've gotten a reputation as a Ranger. I was on my way to the little town of Wild River, where I had quite a job cut out for me. The town had been living in a constant state of fear and turmoil due to the lawlessness and senseless brutality of a gang of bold outlaws... led by a desperado known as The Hawk. Come on! This part-Indian bandit always left havoc and death behind him. Challenging law and order, The Hawk and his henchmen had run riot with holdups and killings. Posses and determined citizens gave them chase, but The Hawk and his picked band of desperadoes had always managed to elude them. The Express Company of Wild River seemed to be The Hawk's special prey, and its stagecoaches were no longer safe on the road. The sheriff of Wild River harangued his fellow townsmen and promised a reward for The Hawk's capture, dead or alive, not knowing at that very moment, The Hawk was taking his measure. As accurate and deadly as he was on the draw, The Hawk was even more expert with bow and arrow. It was his fiendish trademark, his grim way of reminding Wild River that tangling with him meant certain death. I was urging Bullet to give me all he had. My job was to lock horns with The Hawk. A fortune in gold dust was waiting in the Express office for shipment to the San Francisco Mint. The Hawk had learned of this, and he was out to grab it. You stay here, Skeeter.

Heh-heh. Hiya, Smiley. Just the man I want to see. Oh, yeah? Well...I hear you're getting hitched. I reckon so.Reckon so. Hot doggies! You gonna make a right smart-looking pair. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a wedding present. How would you like to have your picture tooken? Don't mind if I do.Don't mind if I do. Well, I just couldn't give you a finer present. All it's gonna cost you is four bits. Gosh. Thanks, Smiley.Gosh. Thanks, Smiley. Now, just put your arm around her there. I'll have this thing put together before a kid could eat a watermelon. Hello, Donna. Pete.Hello, Jack. Hello, Jack. Heh-heh. Gonna have your picture taken? Yeah.Yeah, heh-heh. Darn thing! The Hawk! Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em! Get them, Jack. Don't worry about me. It's Durango! Now, I wouldn't go pointing a gun at a friend. Friend? How do I know you're a friend? All I know is you stopped me from fighting with The Hawk. You think so? This would have stopped you if I hadn't. Sorry. Thank you.Forget it. Are you from Wild River?That's right. My father, Clark Mahoney, runs the Circle Y. My name's Jack. Glad to know you, Jack. Folks know me as Durango. Good man to have on my side. Now if you're going after The Hawk, it's not good enough to be quick down here, you gotta be quick up here too.I'll try and remember that. Men like The Hawk always come to the end of the road. So wait and pick your spots. When the odds aren't all against you, that's the time to strike. Let's go, Raider! Mr. Mahoney! Yes? Say, I hear you're about to be sworn in as our new sheriff. That's right.Well, that's nice. Sure would like to be your deputy. Well, thanks, Smiley, But I'm appointing my son Jack. Well, next to me, he's probably about as good as you can find. He'll be a lot of help to you. The Hawk and I have a little unfinished business to clean up. If Dad and I ever form a posse, and you're around, why-- I'm round enough, all right. You can count on me. I'll remember that, Smiley. He might do it. He said that like he meant it. Dad-blame people always wanting to force me to be a deputy or something. I don't wanna be no deputy. Could always get my lumbago back though, couldn't I? Hi, Steve.Well, you've got me mixed with someone else, stranger. Hey! What's the matter with him? That's my old ever-loving buddy. I get the cold shoulder. The glass eye. I don't even get the small hello. Well, maybe he's been sick. Mr. Norton? No, I'm Al Travis. What can I do for you? I'd like to talk to Mr. Norton. Afraid you can't. Well, he's the manager here, isn't he? He was. Till yesterday when the office was held up. He was shot. What? I'm in charge now. So, what do you want? Mr. Norton sent for me.What for? He wanted me to work undercover. Trap The Hawk and his gang. I understand they've been pretty rough on you fellas. Pretty rough on Norton, all right. So, what do you think you could do? He wanted me to try and get back the loot they've stolen. It's the first I've heard of this. Norton didn't tell me anything about you. I've been working with him all the time. That's strange. For all I know, you might be a phony. If that's all that's worrying you, I have credentials.Don't bother. I ain't interested.Well, why not? Because I've got some ideas of my own about this. I can handle The Hawk without any help from strangers. All right. That's how you feel about it, I guess I'm wasting my time.That's how I feel about it. Been nice knowing you, mister. Sorry I can't say the same, Travis. If that ain't Steve Martin, I ain't Smiley Burnette. And if I ain't Smiley Burnette, who am I? Might even be somebody I don't even know. Or maybe not even likemaybe. Hmm! Looks fine on you, Dad. Say, it does look good. Look good in a photograph too, wouldn't it? I don't know much about this picture-taking 'cause I've been taking lessons by mail, but I got a real nice camera, and one day I'm gonna get the lens on and take some goods ones. Everybody get around there. Gather around the sheriff. That's it. Gather around him. And I'll set this darned gadget up here some way. I'm gonna buy me a pawn shop and borrow some money on it. Oh, hold still. Swap it right now for a good Barlow knife. Now, gather around there, boys. Little closer. That's it. Now, if you want a copy, you can get a copy for 50 cents to set on your piano. For a dollar, I'll come sit on your piano myself. This won't take long. Take your picture quick as you could shoot an arrow. What is this anyhow? Can't a fella set a camera up in the middle of public street without people shooting arrows at him? What does that say? "Mahoney, you won't be sheriff 24 hours. The Hawk." Say, what's going on?Well, fine thing. Read that. What's all the commotion? Read it.Read that message. I get so mad at that Hawk. I wish I was in a way to help go after him. If that horse hadn't busted me up-- I know how you feel, George.We'll take care of The Hawk. We won't do it with six-guns. We have to use our heads. You got any plans? I'm gonna scour the country. Then I'm gonna double that reward. I hope it works.SMILEY: By rights, I ought to have my six-gun out a gunnin' for that Hawk. But I've been troubled with sciatica here lately. Used to be, uh, lumbago, didn't it, Smiley? Well, I got that too.Good luck, sheriff. Thanks, George. Things better change around here too. You go get it. Can't you find some other place to hide your stuff? Why should I? This place is made to order for me. I wish I wasn't mixed up in this. Well, you are, so might as well get used to it, storekeeper. Now, what'd you find out? What'd they say? Mahoney seems to mean business. He's gonna start a search, and he's upping the reward. Ha-ha, he is, huh? Well, he won't live to pay it. Mister, if you ain't Steve Martin, you're his twin brother. You ever stop to think that for reasons of his own, Steve Martin might want to keep undercover? Maybe that's why he doesn't want an old friend to recognize him. Well, wouldn't that old friend know he could trust Smiley Burnette?Sure, he knows. First you've got to promise you'll keep that big mouth of yours shut tight. Oh, that goes without asking. I don't know nothing if you don't want me to. But, hey, what are you hiding from? Ain't like Steve Martin to be afeared of nothing. I'm not afeared, Smiley. And I'm not hiding from anybody. It's The Hawk I'm after and the loot he's stolen. Yeah, well, um, I-- I sure would like to help you, but I've been troubled with high botry lately. High what?Well, advanced high botry, my old ailment. Better not get mixed up in this then. Hey, you see that fella?Yeah. You two ought to get together. That's Jack Mahoney. How so?Well, he's after The Hawk too, for killin' his dad. The Hawk put an arrow through Clark Mahoney right after we made him sheriff. If Jack gets a hold of The Hawk, he's gonna cinch him. You two ought to be in cahoots. Well, I'm gonna work on my own, Smiley. Look, I don't want anybody to know why I'm here except you. If Jack starts pumping me about you, what am I gonna tell him? I'll leave that up to you. Where's the stable? Hiya, bub. Hello, Smiley. Who's the stranger? Oh, him? I don't know. You know, he's a kind of a peculiar individual though. There's no telling what he's up to. What do you mean by that?You know me. I got no hankering for strangers, especially when they're going around with their hand on their gun. He ups to me, and he says, "Hey, fat boy, where's the bank in this berg?" Then he wants to know who the law is here. And I point you out, and he says to me, "Huh, I can take him over anytime I'm good and ready." Thanks. Keep an eye on him. Who? Give me a hand, will you, partner? Thank you, sir. Over here! Over here! Now, step right up, folks, and meet "Yank 'Em Out" Kennedy, the dentist man. Yes, sir! I'm the doctor for your aching tooth. In one minute and out the next. No pain. No fussing around. Why, there ain't nothing to it, folks. You just relax here in my chair, close your eyes, and before you know it, it's all over with. Now, who'll be the first one? Tell you what I'm gonna do. The tooth is out at half the price as a sort of demonstration. All right, think it over. While you're thinking it over, I'll give you a treat. A free show. A little act in hypnotism. Now, I have here this beautiful jackknife and a brand-new silver dollar to the volunteer who will come up here and help me out. Now, who'll it be? How about you, mister? Oh, come on, be a sport. There you are. Now, you stand right over there. Now, just relax and leave the rest to me. Yeah, not till I get that jackknife and the dollar. Here you are. Listen carefully. This is what I want you to do. Look at that jackknife in your right hand with your left eye. Look at the dollar in your left hand with your right eye. That's fine. Now if you just keep looking that way... Through my supernatural powers, this man is in a hypnotic trance. He will do anything I say, as you shall see. I give you this serape. This guitar.

Who are you?I'm old Yank 'Em Out Kennedy. Well, what--? What am I doing with this stuff? Are these yours?Why, you've been having fun. I don't want 'em. How do you feel, my friend?I feel awful. I ache all over. I got a headache. I-- My-- My teeth hurt. Your teeth? Yank 'Em Out Kennedy can take care of that. That's fine. Relax yourself. Open your mouth.What are you gonna do? Only take a second.What are you gonna do? Help! Now, wait just a minute.Get away from me! Wait a minute. I'm not through. Hey, come back here! It's your fault. You sent me up there. I spotted The Hawk and his gang. They're hiding out near Pike's Fork. Here's where we get him.STEVE: Wait a minute. How do you know they're at Pike's Fork? I saw them there when I was riding by. Did they see you?I reckon so. They're not gonna hang around just waiting to be caught.Maybe so or maybe not. If they're not there, we might pick up their trail. The Hawk's too smart for that. If you ask me, this isn't the time to catch him. Nobody's asking you, stranger. I'm getting up a posse to go after The Hawk and his gang. Meet in front of the sheriff's office. I think I better stick around by the Express office to protect it just in case. That's a good idea.Well, good luck. They'll be coming through that pass soon. We'll be down there waiting for 'em. We'll pick 'em off like pigeons. You go ahead, Duke, till you spot 'em. Right. They're comin'. They ain't more than a half a mile away. They're coming from both ways. I ain't gonna stay here and be blasted. Hold it! Unless you want this through your belly, you'll reach. Well, this is Pike's Fork. If The Hawk was here, probably saw us coming and hightailed it. Here's The Hawk, Jack, and he's all yours. Thanks. We'll take good care of him. Wild River's been waiting a long time for this day. Your job's not done. Not till you've rounded up the gang and recovered that stolen money. We'll keep after them.Oh, and one other thing. That stranger who blew into town, might be safer if you locked him up. Steve Martin? That's right. Howdy, stranger. Something you want? Yeah, let me see a gun.What kind? Oh, that bone-handle .44-40 right there. Look, stranger, you can't load that unless you buy it. I'm not buying it unless I like it. There's only one way to find out. Not bad! Not bad at all. I like the trigger action. Sometime if I remember it, I might even pay you for it. Unless you want a bullet through you, reach, and reach high. No more monkeyshines. Come along with me. What do you got there? Steve Martin. You know, Durango was right. I just caught him shooting up George's store. Well, what do you know? You got company. That's a pretty good day's haul. Yeah, it could've been better if we'd gotten The Hawk's gang. What's your game, mister? Suppose I don't answer that. I keep my business to myself. Besides, how do I know you're not a stool for that sheriff? What's so funny? Reckon you don't know who I am. Wait a minute. Seems I have seen you before. I got it. It was on those reward posters. You're The Hawk. Well, I'm not such a sucker after all. If you can be taken in by that tinhorn sheriff, I don't feel so bad. I'll tell you one thing. I'm not spending much time in this rat hole. I'm getting out. Yeah? How? I'll work it out all right. There's always some way of outsmarting these lawmen. I'll be out of here by tonight, and you'll be with me. You're pipe-dreamin', mister. Seems to me you got a big mouth. I have, huh? Wait and see. Sure. Hello there, my friend. What makes you think you're any friend of mine, you dad-blamed dream-maker. That tooth's been hurting like a mischief since you messed with it. You didn't give me a fair chance. One more yank, that tooth would've been out. One more yank, and you'd have had both of my shoes. You're not fighting about getting a tooth pulled, are you? Ain't no honor in it, is there? If you were Big Chief Granite Jaw, you wouldn't have been scared.I ain't Big Chief Granite Jaw. Besides, what's that got to do with me? Don't you know who Big Chief Granite Jaw is? Some little old country Indian. I ain't even ever heard of him. You don't know your history. You don't know nothing. Big Chief Granite Jaw's one of the bravest Indians ever lived. Now, here are two magic nuggets that he once gave me. As long as those two nuggets are in your possession, no harm can ever come to you. If you want the charm to work, gotta look at the nugget in your right hand with your left eye and the nugget in your left hand with your right eye. That's fine. Now just keep looking that way. Get off the horse on the wrong side. Ugh. Whoa, chief. Chief climb mountain. Don't fall. Whoop! Now turn around, chief. Hold it. Beautiful eagle feather for chief. Ugh!Ah, chief! Shh! Wake up papoose. Papoose keep chief up all night. Chief scalp papoose. You make big mistake, white-- White man. Chief ornery. Chief push ducks in water. Chief pull up widow woman's corn. White man get rid of big chief's pain. Him chew buffalo meat with tooth. Leave Indian chief alone, white man. Now, open mouth, and you can drink milk. No!Come on, chief. You make big mistake. Wait a minute now, chief.I'll scalp you. Now-- Now, just a minute now, chief. Chief cut initials on your chest. Oh, no, no! Chief good man. Oh, no! Look, chief, now, have a heart. Chief no can stand white man's face. Chief need more white man to scalp. Grr, go find more. No, no! Chief, come back here. Need away.Hey, chief, come back here! Hey, chief, come back here! Loose Indian! Loose Indian! Loose Indian! Loose Indian! Loose Indian! What are you doing now?Hitting the hay. Don't take those boots off. Well, why not? Because we're gettin' out of here. Let me know when it happens. It's gonna happen right now. Maybe you think the bars are made of candy and we can eat our way out. Or maybe the sheriff's coming over to unlock the door. That's exactly what he's gonna do. I think you're cracked, fella. Get ready, partner. This is it. With a piece of paper? Yeah. And a coffee mug. What's going on in there?I don't know. Somebody threw a rock through that window, I guess. What's in your pocket? My hand.What else? Nothing. Let's have the paper. Do you want me to come in and get it? There's nothing to get, sherif.I'll see about that. Keep 'em covered, Tom. Sure will. All right. Both of you get over there and turn around. Hold it, sheriff! I'm trigger nervous. Now both of you get over there and don't turn around. I told you the sheriff would open up, Hawk. Come on. Lock 'em up. I gotta hand it to you, mister. It was a pretty neat getaway. Ha-ha! I told you there'd be nothing to it. You know, I like the way you think. How about joining up with me? That's a deal, partner. It's The Hawk. You sure got out of that clink fast. Hi, Hawk. Glad to see you. How'd you bust out?It was easy, heh. Sheriff never even knew what hit him. Hawk and I are a pretty slick combination. Where'd you pick up this windbag? He's okay. And we're cutting him in. Steve, meet the gang. Duke, Smoky, Skeeter. Howdy. Howdy. So this is your gang. They don't look so tough to me. Tough enough to take you on, mister. Easy, you.Hold it, boys. Now, we gotta work together. Maybe Steve is long on gab, but he's long on nerve too. We can use him. Ain't it about time we was hearing from Al Travis about that next gold shipment?It sure is. I don't hanker having to hang around here with Durango so close. I wouldn't let The Hawk hear me talking thataway. Sure. Who's afraid of Durango? Heh, he's only one hombre. After all, there are five of us. Look, maybe you'd like to take Durango on yourself? Well, why not? Lead's lead. My bullets are just as good as his. Maybe so, but he's faster on the draw. Oh, you think so? Can Durango do any better than that? What's going on here? Ah, Deadeye Dick's been showing off. And he ain't bad. I never saw you draw that fast, Skeeter. Maybe you ought to take lessons from him. This place is better than that hick jail, right? Sure is, partner. But, you know, with Durango around, I don't think it's a safe spot to stash our stuff. It ain't.Then why don't we move it? I did. All the brains ain't in one head, see? You're right, Skeeter. Only some of us haven't any. That's a horse on you, Skeeter. Hey. If we don't get some firewood, there won't be no supper. The newest member of the gang always hustles it up. So?I sort of run things around this shebang, so go on. Move. Look, Skeeter... nobody pushes me around. Could be I sort of like to run things myself. So maybe you and I better have a showdown right now. Oh, I don't know. Throw a bucket of water on him. When he comes to, tell him I said to fetch the wood himself. Hey, Skeeter, you better stick to whittling your cannon. Hold it. I'll find out what he wants. How! Ugh. Who you? Smiley, I don't know what you're up to, but hightail it out of here, and fast. Me no Smiley. Me Indian Chief Granite Jaw. This is no time to fool around. Listen to your old friend Steve, will you? You old friend. You smoke peace pipe, see? What's this all about?I don't know. He acts loco. Thinks he's an Indian. Ugh. Me friend white man. No scalp 'em. Catch 'em up good song. Me sing, huh?

Look, Smiley, don't you think this crazy business has gone far enough? No savvy.Oh, I give up. I... Say, when did you see that dentist last, Yank 'Em Out Kennedy?Who him? You're in for a big shock, chief. Steve, what in the thunderation are you doing here? Well, what am I doing here? Where'd I get all this Indian regalia? Now, take it easy, old Chief Granite Jaw. It was the dentist, remember?The dentist? Yeah, he sure fixed you up fine. Yeah, I remember. Where am I? In The Hawk's hideout. Who? You heard me. You've been matching bows and arrows with him. Whew!Heh! Oh, bother, you sure give me plenty to worry about. I'm getting out of here pronto.Oh, no you're not, Smiley. I may need you.Well, all right, if you say so. But what are you hanging around here for? I'm one of Hawk's gang.You, one of The Hawk's? Listen, did that dentist hypnotize you too? No, I'm here with my eyes wide open to find out where The Hawk stashes his stuff. When I do, we'll put The Hawk and his gang where they belong. Don't say that "we" so carelessly. Weain't about to stay here. I'm gettin' out of here. Here comes The Hawk now. If you know what's good for you, you'll keep right on being Chief Granite Jaw. What do I do? I don't know any Indian talk. Oh, just say "ugh." That'll keep you out of trouble. "Ugh." Whoo! How's the big chief this morning? Ugh!I reckon that means he's all right.That's right. I mean, ugh! What's the matter with him? Must have found some firewater, maybe drank a little too much. Ugh!Al Travis just rode in, boss. See you at the shack, Steve.All right. What's Al Travis doing here? Working hand in glove with The Hawk. Ugh! I mean, it's getting more puzzling all the time. Yeah, but the puzzle's almost solved. Get rid of this stuff. Now's our chance to find out what's what. I don't like no part of this. So the gold is in the Express office now, waiting for the Frisco stage to pick it up. Yeah? Waiting for us, you mean. It'll be the biggest haul you've ever made. Good. The bank there will be a cinch for us. When are we leaving? Might as well start now. Be seeing you, Travis. Well?There's that little matter of my cut, remember? I haven't been paid a plug nickel yet. Okay, Travis. You'll get it. You just tell the storekeeper to clear out the safe and load the stuff in his wagon.And I get paid then? Stop worrying. Tell the storekeeper to meet us at the bridge. You get back to Jack fast as you can. Tip him off the gang's breaking camp. Tell him to hop on it fast. They'll take the road through the pass. I'm depending on you.Oh, man, you ain't got nothing to worry about. Don't forget what I said, Travis. Who's that? Ah, Steve Martin.Steve Martin? He's a Ranger. Norton sent him to get us. A Ranger?We'll meet you later. Well, that finished him. Jack! Jack! The Hawk's heading for the pass. You can cut him off if you get a move on. Sure this isn't another false alarm, like at Pike's Fork? This is not a false alarm, Mr. Jack. I just left The Hawk's camp and laid a trap for him. Sure, Smiley.Honest Injun! This is the truth to my name or my middle name ain't Ananias. I swear on a stack of-- Hey! Ain't you gonna take a posse with you? How about that guy going all by himself? Not a lick of sense. If I'd been gonna send a fool, I should have gone myself. Hey, look! That's the threat. You two take the pass. We'll cut over by the creek. Well, I'd say you got yourself quite a loopful. I didn't get The Hawk. You'll never have to worry about him again. Why not?He's dead. Did you catch these hombres single-handed? I followed your advice, use my head. I trapped them like The Hawk once tried to trap me, coming out of the pass.You did a good job. Remember, I once told you, men like The Hawk always come to the end of the road. Let's go, Raider. Reach, mister. If you're still looking for that paper, you won't find it. But you will find a letter from Mr. Norton. I'm Steve Martin. Came here to help Norton get The Hawk. Certainly had me fooled. But you don't have to worry about The Hawk. Durango took care of him.He did? Well, what do you know? There's something else I don't understand. Why did you help The Hawk break jail? Wanted to give him plenty of rope, make him show where that loot was stashed.He sure did show us. Me and Steve can do just about anything we set our mind to. Sheriff, your jail's gonna be plum full. We locked up Travis and that storekeeper. Caught 'em trying to make off with the stuff. Well, thanks a lot. Wild River can use men like you, Steve. Hope you decide to stick around. Well, maybe someday-- Hey, Smiley! Where are you going? Well, I'm gonna go get my camera. I wanna take a picture of Jack when he locks up them jaspers. Hello there, Granite Jaw. How's the tooth today? Hey. Look here. With your right eye, look at that finger. And with your left eye, look at that finger. See?
