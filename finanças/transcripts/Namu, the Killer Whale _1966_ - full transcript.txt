The sea, mother of life on our planet. The sea, where floating microscopic cells evolved into giant creatures that ravaged and terrorized the Earth for millions of years. The dinosaurs have long since passed into history, but the largest creatures of all, the whale, survived. And among them, one, the most feared and most dangerous of all the world's animals. Wherever its mast-like dorsal fin cuts water, it becomes a beacon of fear for all who see it. The only chance to survive is to run, to retreat, to escape its path. Even the giant sea elephants refuse to venture into the sea where these killers are present. All the oceans of the world are home for this legendary killer of the deep. ♪ Come all you good people and hear my story ♪ ♪ Concerning Namu the killer whale ♪ ♪ I'll tell you some things that are bloody and gory ♪ ♪ And thereby hangs a tale ♪ ♪ Live and let live let nature be your teacher ♪ ♪ Respect the life of your fellow creature ♪ ♪ Live and let live whatever you do ♪ ♪ And always remember the killer whale Namu ♪ ♪ It happened one time in the northwest waters ♪ ♪ Two fishermen some whales they spied ♪ ♪ They shot one whale a six ton female ♪ ♪ She swam to the shore and she died ♪ ♪ Live and let live let nature be your teacher ♪ ♪ Respect the life of your fellow creature ♪ ♪ Live and let live whatever you do ♪ ♪ And always remember the killer whale Namu ♪ ♪ Her mate swam behind her trying to find her ♪ ♪ And oh how he cried and he mourned ♪ ♪ Until Hank Donner he happened upon her ♪ ♪ And upon her mate so forlorn ♪ ♪ Live and let live let nature be your teacher ♪ ♪ Respect the life of your fellow creature ♪ ♪ Live and let live whatever you do ♪ ♪ And always remember the killer whale Namu ♪ The hale made noises all night long. I listened. I was understanding what he was trying to say. Did he try to tell me about his sorrow for his dead mate, about his loneliness or with these meaningless sounds? I had a strong feeling that this big whale was an intelligent being with a man-sized brain and didn't speak man's language. It'd come up from the depth of the sea to confront man and the day may come when man will confront different looking creatures on other planets, the problem will be the same. How are we going to tell whether it's a beast or something like we are, with passion and compassion. I wished I knew. It was only two days ago that my work led unexpectedly to our first encounter. Hank! Whales, Hank! Whales, right out there. All right, let's move! Grab it! Let's go. There, straight ahead. Look, mother and calf. She's charging us. She's just protecting her calf. She's just pushing us away from it! They're shooting at whales. They know better than that. Gray whales are protected by law. Those aren't grays. Come on, let's get over there. Hold there. Watch out, they're coming in. You all right? Two of them, they're heading for shore. Let's follow them. One is a female or a calf. That's our cove just beyond them. Wouldn't you say we're close enough to them? Come on, stop dragging your feet, we don't get this chance every day. That's okay with me. They're headed right into the cove. If they're not careful, they're going to beach themselves. One of them did. That's the female. She must have been shot. The big one followed her in. You hear that? Is that him? I don't get it, what's going on? I don't know, unless she's dead. That's a male. You can tell by the height of his fin. So? Well, family ties are pretty strong, like that gray whale that tried to push our boat away from the calf. Are you trying to tell me that he followed her all the way in here to help her? Why else did he attack Joe Clausen's boat? What's on your mind, Joe? What's on my mind? You're not going to kill that whale. Not going to what? The whale's not bothering you now. Just leave him alone. Doesn't he know what a killer whale... Deke, will you tell him? He's not a fisherman, like you and me, Joe. But he knows about killer whales. Besides, I'm not paid for giving advice. I just get paid for driving his boat and helping him. Oh, Joe, I leased this cove, the cove is mine, the whale's in the cove, the whale's mine, that's all. He's right about that. What's in a man's fish pen is his. That's a killer. It scares the fish off. He wasn't anywhere near your nets. Eats our salmon. Your salmon? That's open sea out there. It just tried to kill us. Of course he did. You provoked him, you killed the female. Now, sir, there ain't nobody got more respect for the law than we have in this neck of the woods. We never even see a sheriff except during election time. I know that. Nobody's more law abiding than me. Now, if you don't mind. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute! I think you're crazy. All right, maybe I am. Just go back to your boat. I'll send the gun back with Deke. What about Deke? Why didn't he speak up? He's one of us. What are you gonna do, Joe? Joe Clausen is a man who usually gets what he's after. Anyway, tomorrow he'll be gone. I'm not too sure of that, Deke. Estimated weight of the bull, nine to ten thousand pounds. Length over all, 25 feet. Height of the dorsal fin, five feet. Fish and Game Department will haul away the dead female. They promised me a complete examination - and will furnish me with photographs. - Hi. What's the matter, has he gone? No, he's still there. He just went under again. I told you to stay with him. Oh, he's all right. He's just going up and down, you know. Deke, I'm gonna... I'm gonna try and keep him here if I can. Keep him here? In what kind of a bottle? Deke, try to understand something, will you? For 15 years, I've been doing marine research. I can tell you anything that anybody knows about gray whales, blues, humpbacks. I can tell you what they eat, how they sleep, how they breathe. Okay, so you know about whales. Nobody, nobody in the world knows anything about that animal. Look, you just can't put him in a laboratory. The killer whale is completely unknown as a living creature. Nobody has ever had a chance to study him alive. Well, that's understandable. If I can keep him... That's my laboratory right there. That cove could be my laboratory. Maybe a net would hold him. A net? You're gonna try to keep him in a net? Well, whatever you say. Good night. Good night, Deke. See you in the morning. Yeah. ♪ While Namu, he was crying ♪ ♪ Hank Donner was trying ♪ ♪ To understand what the whale told ♪ ♪ Would Namu soon be leaving or stay on there grieving ♪ ♪ For his poor mate so silent, so cold ♪ Good morning. Morning. Well, I see they took the dead female away. Yeah, but he stayed. You should have heard him when they started to move her. Have you been here all night? Yeah. Can you hang around for a while? I've got to go into town. For a net? Yeah, for a net. I think I know why he stayed, Deke. He told you. He's crying for his dead mate. I thought you'd say that. Turn on the tape recorder. Bill, grab a line. Good morning, Ben. Psst! Sam! That's the man they've been talking about. You mean that guy? Hey, Nick. Where's Joe Clausen? Go find him. Morning. Morning, Mrs. Rand. It's kind of chilly out there. How's the weather in here? Well, you can hardly blame them. I mean, after all, a killer whale in your cove. Now, this is a very quiet killer whale and he's not bothering anybody. How would you feel if your neighbors in the city brought home a wild timber wolf and kept it in their back yard? A timber wolf? Hi, Mr. Donner. Hi, Lisa. What do you want, honey? Are there more veins or arteries? Veins. Veins, honey. Thanks, Mom. She's full of questions like that I can't answer. Thanks for the assist. I hope I'm right about the veins. Well, how can I return the favor? Morning, Kate.Morning. Morning, Kate. CHARLIE: Good morning, Miss Kate. I want a net to close off the cove. Say, that whale is still in there. Yeah, Burt, I guess he is. A net to keep the whale in? Well, let's say as a boundary marker to keep Mr. Clausen out and maybe keep the whale in so I can study him for a while. Kate, don't you sell him no net. We want that killer whale out of there now, that's all of us. About 200 yards will be fine, Kate. We said no net. With cork floats and weights, so it'll hang to the bottom. Kate, you better listen to me... Joe, be reasonable. Now, look you. We got nothing against you science fellas coming up doing your work. I got nothing against rockets going up there to the moon, but down here in the sea there's hard fact. We make a living off of it. You don't know what kind of killer fish you're dealing with. Mister, there ain't no fish in the world like that one. Blowing and a jumping right out of the water at you. He's pure killer! Any of the old timers around here are gonna tell you the same thing. Charlie. Charlie, come here. You tell him, will ya? That's right, mister. I've seen the big ones, all of them, the sperm, finback, bowhead and plenty of killer. Heard tell of a man fell over the side once with killers down below, only half a man came up. They're bad, mister, real bad. And I heard tell of a fellow cut one open one time, and he found ten sea lions and a dozen porpoises in the belly. You saw what one of them killers did to our boat. It's a miracle we're here and not eaten alive by that monster. You'd feel different if you'd been near them teeth ready to tear you apart. Donner, you read books, don't you? Well, just now and then, Joe, nothing serious. You read books written by your own kind of people, you know what they say about your whale? He's a real monster! A man-eater. All right, all right. Charlie, did you ever see a man who had been chewed up by a killer whale? I mean, actually, did you ever see one? Heard tell this, heard tell that, you heard tell, right, Burt? That's a lot of nonsense. Nobody knows anything about killer whales. They never had a chance to study them. All right, I think it's about time they did. Two hundred yards will be fine, Kate. Kate. Kate, you know this town gives you a pretty good living. Joe, you have no right to threaten me. Kate. Kate, I'm just trying to point out to you how this town feels about... All right, all right, wait a minute. Wait a minute, will you? I don't want you to do anything that's going to get you into trouble, Kate. There won't be any trouble. This town gives me a living because I give it 12 hours a day. And Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, if they come knocking at my door. Which includes you, Joe. Last Sunday at 6:00 a.m. for 200 feet of wire. You'll have your net by morning. You sure you want to do this, Kate? I'm sure. Thanks for the assist. Well, he just ain't gonna let us do this a nice way. You been down at the cove yet? We're all going. You want to come? We want to see that killer. He's a man-eater. I'll bet he could get a whole man down his belly. Hey, that day your father went diving for abalone. My mother said the kelp tangled him. He never did come up. They never found him. The current took him away. Everybody knows something swallowed him, something big with teeth. can swallow 100 sea lions and 100 porpoise. There's no such thing. Let me go. We're all going down to see him, up close. You want to come, don't you? No. What are you afraid of, if there's no such thing? I'm not afraid. You know what? You want to know where your father really is? In his belly! That's where he is. If you really want to know where... No, he's not. He's not! I guess our net marks the boundary to the cove pretty clearly. Yeah. Now, when he decides to leave, he can either go over it or through it. Thanks a lot. If I can get him to eat something. Yeah. He hasn't taken a single one yet. He's a wild animal, Deke, it takes time. Maybe he just doesn't like frozen fish. Why don't you go see if you can get us 50 pounds of fresh salmon. Yeah, the anchor line to the net is coming loose. I'll have to tighten it. Where is he? He's here someplace. You'll see. There he is. Yeah. Leave me alone. Hey. Hey, there. Although the whale has made no attempt to cross the net, he has refused to take food for five days. There was one variation in his behavior today. The whale repeatedly swam towards the dock where I was standing, he stopped, facing me and before submerging, made a kind of a soft whistling sound, apparently in my direction. Why not? He likes you. Yeah, well, this is a very intelligent whale. He's got good taste. Intelligent? Well, I'll tell you one thing, smart buddy, one thing we do know, that whale out there has a brain in relation to his size, about 40 percent larger than yours and mine and is just as complex, too. I mean, maybe he was trying to tell me something. Deke, you heard him the other morning, those... Those were distress sounds he was making, now weren't they? Maybe. Yeah. All right, now. If he can make one kind of a meaningful sound, then why not another, a different kind of a meaningful sound? From a whale to a man, like talk? I don't know, I'm just guessing. But I'm saying, there's reason to guess, you understand? I suppose so. Like the dolphin, the sounds the killer whale makes seem to vary according to circumstances and outside stimulus. I intend to use an underwater microphone to record these variations and to try to decode their meaning. Hi, Lisa. Come on out. It's all right, come on. Well, hi. Is he in there? The whale? Yeah, he's in there someplace underneath the water. What's he doing? What's he doing? Well, I guess he's taking a bath. Hear those sounds? That's him, that's whale talk. Do whales talk? Kind of. Most animals talk to each other, some way. Were you over there the other day and ran away? There was a big thing. It came at me. It tried to get me.Uh-huh. Was it something like... Something like this? That was me, Lisa. I was in my diving suit. I was fixing the anchor line on the net. Oh! If you were so scared, why did you come back today? The kids at school, they said it was a monster. I... I just had to see. Well, now come on, I think that's kind of silly, don't you? Look, there he is right now. Isn't he beautiful? Do you want to talk to him? Talk to him? Sure, people talk to dogs, come here. Now, he's underwater, so this helps him hear. All you have to do is just talk in there and you push that down, see? What'll I say? Say "hello." Hello, whale. This is Lisa. That's silly. Whales can't talk. Well, he has a very big brain, Lisa, and he makes sounds. Maybe we just don't understand what he's saying. He's after me! He's after me. Lisa, what's the matter? Honey, that's just the way he breathes. Lisa, I have to take this tape recorder up to the trailer, would you help me? Here, you take this. ♪ Live and let live let nature be your teacher ♪ ♪ Respect the life of your fellow creature ♪ ♪ Live and let live whatever you do ♪ ♪ And always remember the killer whale Namu ♪ Want a piece of gum? Mmm-mmm. Did you ever hear of the Umatillas? Lisa? Did you? Indians. They used to live on this seashore. Did you know there was a story about them? Well, there is. It was like a long time ago, there was a great big earthquake, and it split the Umatilla land. And it left half of the tribe on the mainland and half on an offshore island. And it was their hope to get back together again. There were whole families that were split up. And brothers and sisters, and... Daughters and fathers? Hmm, daughters and fathers. But they couldn't get together because there was this great big monster, who lived in the ocean, between the mainland and the island. Now they called him "Namu," which meant "Whirlwind." And this was the biggest, most ferocious, the ugliest monster in the whole wide world. Everybody said so. Except there was a prince. Well, no, not this time, but there was an Indian princess. A little girl. Well, one day the little princess went for a walk. Down to the seashore. See, she was thinking that the monster would let her people get together again. She went all by herself? Yeah. She was a very brave little girl. But when she got there, all of a sudden, right in front of her, the big monster came right up out of the water. Well, now she was scared. I mean, she was so scared, she couldn't even move, because she thought, well, this is gonna be the end of me. He's just gonna eat me right up. Did he? No. He spoke to her, very quietly, in a language that only she could understand. What did he say? He said, "Get on my back "and I will take you to your island." Did she? Mmm-hmm. He was so slippery. Didn't she fall off? Well, no, because she hung on real tight to his top fin. And besides, he swam very, very carefully. And he took her to the island and he put her gently on the shore. He wasn't fierce at all. No. But everybody said he was a monster. But nobody had talked to him except the little girl. Did he turn into a handsome prince? Well, I guess he just about had to, didn't he? And then when she grew up they were married and they lived happily ever after. You mean, he's Namu, don't you? Mmm-hmm. Hey, I think that's a good name for him. Let's call him that, all right? I have to go home now. Will you come back and visit us? You come any time you want to. Come on, I'll walk you home. ♪ Live and let live let nature be your teacher ♪ ♪ Respect the life of your fellow creature ♪ ♪ Live and let live whatever you do ♪ ♪ And always remember ♪ ♪ The killer whale Namu ♪ Well, I guess that gap's getting wider by the second. I'm gonna have to go under water and splice some net. Say, but he'll be able to get at you. Oh, I'll stay on my side of the net. The net? Now, come on, don't argue, Deke. If that thing gets any wider, he's gonna be able to get away. Here come our friends. Oh, boy, that's great. If he gets out now, he's a dead whale. Well, better they get him than he gets you. Whales have a kind of natural radar, Deke. He's not gonna touch that net. It means danger to him. Now, let's go. You're risking your neck just to save a whale. Oh, no. Come on back over here. What do you think you're doing? Get back on the other side of the net. Don't you remember what he did to Joe Clausen's boat? Look out. He's coming for you! Deke, be quiet. Hang on. Don't be in a hurry. Fish food. You were almost fish food. Did you see him? He chased you, he bumped you, he rammed you, he spun you into the drink, he tried to finish you off. That's what he was doing. Wait a minute. What'd you just say? I said he dumped you into the drink. He spinning, spinning and spun me around? Yeah, he spun you around. He was trying to finish you off. Well, that doesn't make sense, does it? What doesn't make sense? His spinning me around. He could have had me anytime he wanted me. Well, sure he could. And he almost did, too. You want to hear something crazy? What? I think he was playing with me. Playing with the boat. Playing with you? Playing with the boat? Look, that's 10,000 pounds of killer whale. He could have dumped me in the drink, he could have had me for lunch anytime he wanted me. Well, so? That's a beginning, Deke. That's a beginning. "Killer whales are without a doubt "the most terrible flesh-eating creatures "on this planet, surpassing even the great white shark in fierceness." Did you fill this bottle today? No. I must have left the valve open. "The killer whale has been reported to have battered ice flows "to get at marooned men." Did you finish that cheese? I'm talking about whales, not cheese. Did you finish the cheese that was on the plate? Yes. "Gray whales will attack almost anyone or anything molesting them. "They are agile, powerful and persistent. "There is one creature, however, that scares them into a frenzy. "This is the killer whale." Did you read these books? Sure, I read the book. You stole it out of my library, didn't you? Well, this is the intelligent pet you've got out there in the cove. Look, Deke, I've got a lot of other notes to make tonight. I've got to be up early, so, I'll see you in the morning, all right? Come on, Namu. Come and get it. Honey, are you sure that he said it would be all right if we came down here? Sure. Anytime. Honest, Mom. Well, okay. Do I look all right? Yeah. You look fine. Here. Come on. Come and get it. So much for try number 551. Hi. Hi there. So that's Namu, huh? I see it's lunchtime. Is that the first or second course? Well, that's the appetizer and I'm afraid he isn't going to take it. Oh? If he doesn't eat in the next couple of days, I'm going to have to let him go. He'll starve to death. Is he sick? No, he's just stubborn. Deke, let me try that again, will you? What are you doing? Well, sometimes when I do this, he comes to me, hon. Here he comes. Whales like to have their backs scratched, you know. Would you like to help me? All right. One hand here and one there. All right, come in, Namu. Here, Namu. Here, Namu. Just talk to him, Lisa. Tell him that he's your friend, that you like him. Mmm-hmm. Talk to him now. You like to have your back scratched, don't you? Mommy says you're an animal, not a fish. That you breathe air like us or you'll drown. You have babies. That you're warm inside. You feed them milk. Now just keep talking to him. Hold onto it. Nice, Namu. Doesn't that feel good, Namu? Lisa, here, take this. Now call to him. And when he comes, you feed him his lunch, all right? Namu. Here, Namu. Here's your lunch. He took it. He took it. Oh, God! Give me another. Now, it's my turn, honey. Come here. Come on, Namu. Come for me. Come on. Come on, here's a nice, nice little tidy tidbit. Come on up. Come on, baby. Hey, give me another one. This time he's gonna take it out of my hand. He's liable to take it and your hand. Let's hope he knows the difference. Come on, big boy. Come on, just be gentle. He does, Deke. He knows the difference. He knows it. Yeah. Oh, brother! I'm right. I know I'm right. I just know I'm right. All right, all right, maybe I'm losing my scientific objectivity. But whenever I'm near that animal, I feel I'm... In the presence of an intelligence and a mystery. Namu, I wish I can understand your language. And you mine. Well, maybe one day we'll find a way. Maybe... Maybe it'll be something more direct than what it has been. Something as simple as touch. A language of mutual trust and... Hank? Yeah. I was going to knock you out. You were going to do what? I've been arguing my head off all morning. It just wouldn't listen. So I figured it was the only way. But I guess, sooner or later you'd go ahead and do it anyhow. It's going to be okay, Deke. Good luck. Thanks. No. Hi, Deke. Lisa, go home. Why? Never mind. Just please go home. I always come down. I just came to visit. Oh! Hi. Hi. They're playing. They're having fun. Well, is he a monster or is he a prince? He's a prince. Namu, I love you. Mommy, I feel so good tonight. Into bed. Come on. Oh, boy, this mattress is gonna be flat as a pancake inside of a week. Is Mr. Donner still here? Yeah. He's still here. Can I say good night to him again? Sure you can. Night, night. I'm impressed. This is a good collection. You had to go pretty deep for some of these, didn't you? Mmm-hmm. My husband and I did quite a lot of diving when he was alive. It seems that you made quite a conquest. I hope you don't mind, Lisa wants to say good night to you again. Oh, good, I planned it that way. Well now, let me see, you're all tucked in here, huh? Good night, sweetie. Oh... Oh, I get a hug, too. Sleep tight. What's the matter? The door? No, no, leave it shut. Okay. That's the first time she's gone to bed without being afraid of the dark, I don't know how long. She's really afraid of monsters. Sea monsters. I know. Deke told me about your husband. And I am very grateful to you. Well, maybe you ought to thank Namu. Maybe you're right. I want to thank you. Oh, for what? The dinner was easy. You helped with the dishes. No, listen. For an old bachelor who lives alone in a trailer... You know, she gave me a great, big hug in there. I understand. Good night. Good night. We ain't selling no more salmon. Not to him, we ain't. Donner. What's on your mind, Clausen? I'll tell you what. Word just come down that salmon are running off the Cape 100 miles north. Three days they'll be here. Now that killer whale of yours has gotta he out of these waters by tomorrow. Fred, you better start working... The whale is eating my salmon, not yours. He's in my cove. How do you know he's gonna stay in there? The net keeps him in there. Well, I ain't taking that chance. You're gonna have to take that chance. The whale stays. Well, then, Fish and Game is gonna haul him off like the last one. Because I'll tell you what. I'm gonna kill him and every other one I see. Every last one of them. I know you, Clausen. I've known you all over the world. You killed the whales, you killed the elephants, you killed the birds. Senseless destruction. You don't know what to kill. You don't even know what you are. Where can we get some salmon for Namu? Just up the coast. About half an hour. Salmon are coming in. That killer whale's gonna be out of here by noon tomorrow. Come on. Now you'll see. Mr. Donner not only swam with Namu, but he played with him, too. Aah! My grandpa knows better than you. He said that whale's a killer. You're a liar. Some day, Nicky Wilson, I'll slap your face. Oh, yeah? I'll even feed Namu. Your grandfather doesn't know everything. Come on. Watch this. You see? Can I throw one in, too? Sure. Isn't he nice? Uh-huh. Look, he's eating it. But will he take one from anybody. Sure. Go ahead. What happened to him? Namu, don't. Please, Namu, don't. Look at this. I told Joe Clausen he was a fool for not shooting that whale. It's a wonder we weren't all killed, or mangled, or chewed alive. Somebody get Joe Clausen. Listen, we need big caliber rifles. Andy, you bring mine. Mommy, Mommy. Mommy, Mommy. Lisa, honey, what is it? What is it? What happened? Namu is sick. He sort of went wild. Come on. What happened with this? I don't know. Deke, there's something wrong with Namu. Uh-oh. All right, let's go. What's going on? What do you people want? The whale. Where is he? There. There's the beast. All right, let's not get excited. What's the complaint? He tried to kill all our kids. Just look at this. Did anybody see it happen? Half a dozen kids saw it. Now, look, Donner, we're gonna finish off that whale and we're gonna do it now. This is my property, Burt, there isn't going to be any killing here. We're only saving the state police the trouble. Lisa, come here. Were you there? Lisa, what happened with Namu? We were feeding some fish to him. Nicky threw one. He ate it, then started jumping. Now are you satisfied? Wait a minute. Lisa... Wait for what? For that whale to come jumping out and get somebody else? You stay here. All right, I'm right at the edge. Is he coming after me? Is he gonna jump out of the water and get me? Deke, give me a piece of fish. Lisa, which one is Nick? Him. Did you throw this to the whale? Did you throw this to Namu? Did you? So what? Look what it did to those kids. It's all right. It's all right. The boy's right. What if he did? What do you think any animal would do if he hooked his mouth like this? That whale will kill anything he can reach with his teeth. I'll show you how dangerous he is. Deke, bring me the gear. Bring me the gear. Hank, uh-uh, not this time. He's already acting strange and not with this crowd here. Don't do it. Come on, it'll be all right, Deke. Just a bunch of tricks. Soon as he gets out of there, I'm gonna finish off that whale. Can't Mr. Donner stop them? He's trying, sweetheart. Mommy, don't let them. Deke. There's nothing I can do. Look at them. Oh, no, I want you to watch Lisa for me. I'll be right back. All right, now who's willing to put a bullet in him? I am, Donner. Hey. Don't, don't. You think Namu's a killer. Hank says he's friendly and won't hurt anyone. And we believe Hank, don't we? Hey. No. Hi, Mom. Hi. You still want to shoot him, Burt? Joe! Joe, don't. Don't shoot my Namu. Just like shooting fish in a barrel. Deke, cut the net. Did he shoot Namu? I don't think so, honey. All right, now, go on. Save yourself. Come on, you big dummy, get out of there. Well, he could have killed you, but he saved your life. There he goes. Who would've figured a thing like that. There's another one. That's a smaller fin. Probably a female. Hank! Hank! All right, Clausen. Is Namu all right? He's fine, Lisa. Is he coming back? Well, no, I don't think he is. But he's out there with his friends now, and you know something? He might even have a brand-new family. Oh.
