I've been facing pressure and made to take early retirement In two weeks time I'll emigrate to Canada Shit! Is it so serious? People think Kitter is lousy but I tell you the anti-corruption action of ICAC is severe and everyone is on the nerve During this period you and Fat Kwan still do all the killing and fighting you want the seniors to step on you? I order that you stop now I'll arrange you to sit together and try to have peace Where to? You assure me they will not kill me? At my villa in Tsuen Wan They can each take a body guard while you can take two No one is to take weapons along and for security my men will see to it then it's very safe! I can consider it Who dare to start dispute in your area? Right, Loud Hung wants us to back him for boss's position What do you think? Shit! The Seniors made it clear they want a clean guy and Loud Hung's file is full of bad remarks he can never get a promotion He can bribe someone Anything can be do with money It's different now Not everything can be done with bribery Ho! You'd better think about stopping now it'll be too bad if you get arrested! Loud Hung, you are to hide the gun under the coffee table Before 8 o'clock you're to get controlled of Lui's people At 8:05 Hak, you people are to get the gun from the coffee table and kill his three body guards Simultaneously Man, Ming you're to bring help in I estimate we can open champagne at 8:1O Why don't you laugh? Isn't it funny? As we do killing in Lui's villa how can we tell Lui? Shit! I don't care how to He's on the run himself A retired inspector is a disabled like a tiger without teeth! Take him as paper-tiger I hear that ICAC is a mighty organisation if we start these killings I fear it will bring us trouble This is woman's opinion All officer corrupt, my dear insisted to get rid of all crimes the Anti-Corruption unit set up in 1969 achieved what? Nothing They indeed set that up to make more dirty money I keep sober myself all the time I know what ICAC is About this department it was called to set up by HK Governor himself as he wants dirty money himself then the dirty money needn't pass through,.., Inspectors or whoever else Shit!
