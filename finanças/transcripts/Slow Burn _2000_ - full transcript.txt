Sir, do we have the autopsy report on Vera Church yet? >> No. That's my fault. >> It's been three days. >> Tell me about it. I didn't want to march into the coroner's office, that's all backed up anyway, and start throwing my weight around like the new asshole on the block just to push an obvious strangulation victim to the front of the line. >> You know what? I was thinking maybe there's more to it. You know, the women are still missing and Vera Church was in a suitcase ready to be missing. >> So you're saying Charney's not our guy? >> Either that or Charney's our man or Charney's our man 10 times over. 10 times over. >> I'll get this ledger to the FBI.

No priors, no military service, nothing. >> Does Jerry know that? >> Ha, not yet. >> Don't tell nobody. Nobody. >> Della, he's gonna know in a couple of days. He's gonna see the paperwork. >> Mr. Fingerprints is just a closer. He was sent in by someone to clean up a mess they didn't want seen, hide bodies they didn't want autopsied.

Detective. Polish it up. Wear it on your chest for every interview. >> Sir, I-- >> Samuel Dennis Charney has turned himself into a fugitive. Now this is a major PR coup. We're trying to bring in the FBI, keeping Lee in the hospital for a few more days for photo ops. If everything turns out right, we will be on "Nightline."

And get this-- number nine, Lisa Sears, had vibrators. >> Vibrators? As in coochie toys? >> I had the lab check 'em out. They're hot with radiation. >> So we have all these radioactive women. How are we gonna connect all this? >> [ sighs ] We're never gonna bust this case. We can't. We're taking on big business. >> So? >> Della, before we bring 'em down, they're gonna kill me, they're gonna kill you, they're gonna kill your kids. Go back to the wife-beaters.

Babysitter said she packed an overnight bag, doesn't know where to. >> The point person in a front-page murder case, and you just let her skip town without a trace? >> First, Della Wilder is a very willful woman. There is no question of letting her do anything. Second, I do know how to find her. >> How? >> Well, wherever she is I figure she'd call her kids, right? >> Maybe. She doesn't impress me as much of a mother. >> Well, you're wrong. Anyway, I ordered a tap on her phone. >> It makes sense. >> Except there already is a tap on it ordered by your office on Wednesday afternoon, 15 minutes after she left here, having requested an autopsy on Vera Church. >> I told you how important this case was. I wasn't about to lose control of the situation. Yes, I tapped her phone. Evidently, I didn't go nearly far enough. Is there anything else? >> I'll let you know. >> I'll let you know. I'm checking on it. I'm checking on it. >> It was a classified ad. $50 for completing a medical questionnaire.

After 10 years on the pill, when I heard there would be no headaches, no cramping, no mood swings... >> What was the procedure like? >> He described it as a synthetic hormone that would coat my ovaries for two years so the eggs couldn't get out. >> Is that some kind of radioactive hormone? >> Wait a second. How did they give you the hormone? the hormone? >> Through an IV. >> Through an IV. >> What? What is it? >> It's something called "nuclear imaging."

A month. God, we're so close. All we need is the link between Benning and the doctor. >> And what? We don't have the doctor. He could be dead or living in Poland, and none of his patients are gonna live to testify. >> Well, we'd better find something. find something. And we will, won't we? And we will, won't we?

They said I was fried by something a lot more potent than technetium-99m. >> The order was cancelled on December 14th, so there was no purchase and no delivery. >> They never made the buy? >> Mm, no, no, no. >> Hmm. Are you the only distributor in town? >> Well, we should be. But since the breakup of the Soviet Union, there's been a thriving black market for these materials.

He didn't have to die. >> You don't know how he died. >> Della, tomorrow I gotta go down there and beg somebody to be your partner. I gotta go down to a precinct full of guys who think you're a hotheaded, big-mouthed, man-hating bitch. I ain't looking forward to that. So, please, let me mourn Harlan's death in peace. >> I can't do that. >> Damn it, Della. >> Is everything okay? >> Everything's fine. >> I think it would be a good idea if you said something to the press about Lee, about how admired he was-- you know. >> Sure. >> Okay. >> Okay. >> See you in the morning. >> See you in the morning. >> I'm... very sorry >> I'm... very sorry about your partner. about your partner. >> [ sniffling ] >> Well, look at this-- Grimes with the mayor, Grimes with the mayor, with the DA. with the DA. with the DA. >> [ alarm chirps ] >> [ alarm chirps ] >> Well, top of the morning >> Well, top of the morning to you, Della! to you, Della! >> Harry, I can open the door myself.

Why did you phone up the coroner's office and tell him to hold off on that autopsy? >> We have a suspect, a motive, and a cause of death. There's no sense in complicating your already confused detectives. >> Oh. Matter of fact, I'm pretty confused myself, so I phoned up Sitkoff & O'Neil. >> Is there a particular reason why? >> I think so. Excuse me, you mind Excuse me, you mind if I work from my notes? if I work from my notes? In case you don't know it, you're O'Neil's son-in-law. >> [ laughs ] >> You worked for the firm since you were still a law student at Stanford. O'Neil owns 25% interest in La Montana Spa.

Della, take it easy. >> So this is the, uh, good-cop/bad-cop routine, huh? >> That's right. I'm good, she's bad. >> [ whimpers ] >> You got something to tell me, hmm? Hmm? >> All right. All right. This guy Harwell comes to me and asked me if I could lay my hands on some of that whatchamacallit shit. >> Technetium? >> Yeah, technetium-99. >> 99m? >> No, just technetium-99. I never heard of the shit, but my supplier-- well, he came through. Gave Harwell a good price and he was happy. End of story. >> It wasn't the end of the story.

Not 99m. >> What's the difference? >> 99m is safe, but technetium-99-- its radiation is a lot stronger. It lasts a lot longer before it disintegrates. >> How long? >> How long? >> Millions of years. >> Millions of years. >> Jerry, Della. We need to talk. Meet me at 7:00 at the Tazmahal. Come alone.
