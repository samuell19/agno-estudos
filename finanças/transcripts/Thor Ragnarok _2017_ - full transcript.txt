(TAIKA WAITITI SCATTING) Comic book Flippity-flap-flap (SINGING) Bits of script and lots of characters from the movies (SCATTING) A human throwing my shield Oh, Asgard and oh, a guy with goggles Oh, and a British person A man with an iron hand Arvel... Ah, Marvel studs... Studios Marvel Studios, ooh Marvel Studios Welcome to the director's commentary with me, the director of Thor. Ragnarok, Taika Waititi. Oh, what is this mysterious world we've entered into? It's a smoky place. Maybe it's, uh, someone's lungs who's been smoking. Yes, the inside of the lungs of the Marlboro Man we've found ourselves. Or it's a version of Innerspace and there's a little person stuck to one of the lung glands. Good Lord, it's Joel Edgerton, uh, in shackles. This is the kind of mystery that I wanted to create with this film is that as soon as you walk into this film and as you find yourself in this world, you don't know where you are and we've got the hero of the movie, of course, Thor, telling us everything that's happened to him. Into this cage, where he met you, skeleton man. So... Uh... How much longer do you think we'll be here? I often do these director's commentaries and I find them really hard because you end up just commenting on what's on the screen. And so you'll find the worst director's commentaries are like,"Oh, and then there's a skeleton just fell down. "And then Thor's dangling on a chain "and he's turning around, and then we introduce Surtur." Fun fact, though. Fun fact. The motion capture for the character of Surtur, that big demon, was performed by one of the greatest actors in the world, not just New Zealand, but the world, Taika Waititi. Um... Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins. For all you people who love fun facts, I've got lots of them. That thing on his head is an ancient boomerang. We shot in Australia and we... We were given the boomerang as a gift and we managed to work that and put that as the crown for Surtur, the fire giant. All of that fire is real. I was on fire as I was doing the motion capture. The voice, however... Um... Give it a second. Who can answer this before me, nobody, it's Clancy Brown from one of my favorite movies, Highlander. "There can be only one." So... We shot this movie almost in its entirety in Australia, on the Gold Coast. And this environment is actually exactly what it looks like down there. It's very hot, very smoky... - Okay, so where is it? This crown? - This is my crown... Lots of people made of embers and charcoal. Oh, that's a crown. I thought it was a big eyebrow. So, Chris Hemsworth, what can I tell you about Chris? I did all of the motion capture for him in the movie as well. So every time you see him walking around and talking, that's also me. I basically did all the characters in the film. Me, me, me, me, me. It's all about me. All right, did you notice the little demon guy in the corner there? If you didn't, press rewind and go back to that high-angle shot. There's a little guy who's waking up. Wow, I'm really struck by how good the CGI looks. Really amazing how cool this character looks in a close up. Not him. Not this guy. The other guy. They got big Surtur, the big guy. You know who I'm talking about. Watch this. Look at that. Look at his teeth. How would he possibly brush his teeth? He'd go through so many toothbrushes, wouldn't he? How are you guys enjoying this director's commentary, by the way? On a scale of 1 to 1.1, what would you give it? Whoa! What? He's got a hammer? I didn't know that. I did know that. That's one of the things about directing films. You gotta know some stuff about your characters. (GASPS) Oh, look at that dragon. (IMMIGRANT SONG BY LED ZEPPELIN PLAYING) "Hammer of the Gods." The most perfect song, isn't it? Perfect song. I remember growing up with this song. Who would've thought as a young Taika growing up in New Zealand in the '80s, if you were to say to me, "One day you're gonna use one of the greatest songs ever, "in the history of everness, "in a movie about Thor, the God of Thunder, "that you'll be directing." I would've said, "My friend, "I know, because I can see the future." As a young boy, I could see the future. I've lost that power. I've since lost that power. But I have the reverse power, and I can see the past. I'll be honest, and I don't mean to take away from this movie and how great it is or from myself as a director, but I'm not sure if I'll watch this movie again after this director's commentary. I've seen it quite a few times and I just know everything that happens. Oh! I hope you concentrated on that. All that fire that went into that skull. So all the power of Surtur is now in that skull. Boy, I hope you guys have seen this film before watching this commentary, 'cause I'm about to spoil everything. Heimdall? Oh... It's not Heimdall. Where's Heimdall? I don't know, but look, there's Keith Urban, famous country singer. The Bifrost gives me access to everything... That's Karl Urban. Karl Urban, not Urban. Urban. He is a friend of mine from New Zealand. He's a great New Zealand actor. You would've seen him in other films that I'm not going to name check. All of these props... I hate guns, but look at that. He's got these two guns that are straight out of the comic book. That character, Skurge, if you'd like to know, is very famous in the comics. And those two props that he's got there, they feature heavily in his storyline in the comics. Oh, and this dragon, I've never met before. The first time I ever worked with that dragon was on the set. But we're still good friends to this day. I'm hoping to use her in another film that I'm going to make soon, Manchester by the Sea: Part Two. Okay, here she comes. And ka-boom! Stay! Heimdall? I'm running short on options. - Heimdall? - (RATTLING) Um... Skurge? WAITITI: Things are about to get crazy. Hey, fun fact number 78, that Shake Weight is my Shake Weight. When I was doing Green Lantern with Ryan Reynolds in New Orleans at about midnight in my hotel room, I was watching infomercials and I bought that Shake Weight whilst doing that movie. Cool DC-Marvel crossover for you right there. And now that thing is in the movie. Oh, look. Go, Thor, go! That dragon's gonna get you! Guess what, the movie's called Thor. He's not gonna be eaten by that dragon, I can tell that right now. But, what? Look at that cool transition. (READING) The motion picture. Oh, no, look at this. Oh, no, too close! Oh! We're inside the logo. And... This is one of my favorite moments of the opening. He slimed me. That dragon... We went through about eight dragons before we got it right. People will often say, "No animals were harmed." No Earth animals were harmed making this movie, but, yeah, we did kill a lot of dragons. Look out there, your little sneak peak of Asgard which we're about to see. We're about to go into Asgard itself. Right. Where is Heimdall? This is probably a great time to tell you that I've pretty much blocked out all of my memories of shooting this film. So, if you're expecting to get any incredible information out of me, like anecdotes or filmmaking tips, you have come to the wrong place. No, I don't think so. I think you'll discover some good stuff in this. So, we were working with a great team. You know, this is the third Thor film. And when I came into this experience, you know, I had watched a lot of the Marvel films and was a big fan of them and it's essentially the same team as from the very first Iron Man, you know, still making these films. All the EPs, Kevin Feige, Lou D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, and we had a fantastic executive producer, Brad Winderbaum, working with me. I'm a trickster. So mischievous. Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog. It was a wonderful joke. 'Twas indeed hilarious. (CHUCKLES) WAITITI: Anthony Hopkins in this scene, I told him, "You are going to be playing Tom Hiddleston... We will build a big statue for you. "...playing you." And he said, "Okay, good." And he turned up in blue eyeliner. Matt Damon. I don't know if you guys recognize him from We Bought a Zoo. That's him. It's a little crossover, a little Marvel-We Bought a Zoo crossover thing going on. And that actor there doing his very best impersonation of Chris is Chris's brother, Luke Hemsworth. So there's a little Westworld-Thor crossover as well. There's Sam Neill, one of my players from Hunt for the Wilderpeople. So there's a little Wilderpeople-Taika Universe, Marvel Universe crossover. And that little blue kid was just a local little blue kid that we found. Hard to find a blue kid in Australia, that's for sure. Well, there's a play. A play within a film. Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo. A lot of the sets that you'll see in this film were designed by our great production designers, Dan Hennah and Ra Vincent. Ra has worked with me on What We Do in the Shadows, my vampire film. A brilliant designer. And Dan, and both of those guys were working with Peter Jackson throughout all of the Rings trilogies as well. So they've got a great history of design and really know their stuff. Later on in the film, once we get to Sakaar, you'll see where they came into their own with the design and construction of these incredible sets. A big shout out to them. And actually in Sakaar is also where you'll see some of these amazing costumes by Mayes Rubeo, who is a fantastic designer. That hammer. That hammer that he's tossing around like that weighs five million tons. That is how strong Chris is. I mean, even though you can't see his arms in this frame, you can feel them. You can still feel... Good God, look at them! Disgusting. Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself. Watching theater. Board meetings, and security council meetings... - You're really gonna make me do it? - Do what? (WAITITI CHUCKLES) WAITITI: This part here, I don't know who came up with this idea. I've heard a lot of people take credit for this. And, although it was not my idea, I'm gonna take credit for it, too. All right, I yield. This is something that I've been talking about for years trying to do this moment where Thor's holding Loki and the hammer's zooming back towards them and he forces him to change back into himself. Hey! Classic. Here comes Skurge. He's run all of that way, down that bridge. He should've taken that Vespa that we showed in that shot earlier. That's what I would've done. Just having a sip of coffee. Now, things really start heating up in Thor. Ragnarok. You watch this. What's gonna happen? I know. The brothers are gonna have to team up and head to, you guessed it, (VOCALIZING) Earth. New York. Great place. I've been there many times. That, I'm sorry to break the illusion, is not New York. We shot that in Brisbane. In Brisbane, Australia. Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch. Which is the closest you'll get to New York in Australia, both geographically and also with how it looks. Ask him. Hi, would you mind taking a picture with us? WAITITI: And these two girls were, - they were a couple of street kids. - Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you. She didn't dump me, you know. I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping. What's this? What are you doing? This isn't me. (YELPS) THOR: (WHISPERS) Loki. (HORN HONKS) WAITITI: 177A Bleecker Street. Well, if you're a fan of Doctor Strange, which I am not, you'll know that is Doctor Strange's address and now we're in Doctor Strange's house, the Sanctonium Santrarium or whatever it's called. No, I know what it's called. Sanctum Sanctorum. And I'm lying. Doctor Strange is one of my favorite characters because Benedict Cumbatch-ch-ch, Benedict Cumbatcha, Kombucha, Kombucha-batch, a Batch o' Kombucha, is one of the greatest actors to have ever lived in Atlanta. He is one of my favorites. I love him. And this was the first thing we shot actually. We shot this eight or nine months before we started principal photography on Thor. We knew we wanted this scene and Benedict was shooting Doctor Strange in London, so we went across there with Chris and we shot this scene and it was my first time working with either of these guys and especially with Chris, and it was at that moment working with Chris, I knew I'm doomed. Take a seat. WAITITI: All of these little tricks are all in-camera, you know. So, it's not all about big, crazy special effects with CGI and computer generated things. It's, no... Sometimes you can just do all of your... Someone was just lying down on the floor there with that beer. Just switched it over for him and just out of shot. And you'll notice every time he transports to different parts of the room it's just, we just did that in-camera, meaning, you know, there's no... Well, that's a special effect there obviously. 'Cause beer doesn't do that traditionally. Unless I want it to. So watch this. Here we go. Oh, no, wait. Oh, wait. Wait. Here we go. I'm wasting time here because this is just conversation, I mean. I got no more facts about, I mean... Benedict. What can I tell you about him? He's got a strange symmetrical face, doesn't he? Very symmetrical. I 'd like to do an experiment and just flop the shot just to see. But it does look exactly the same. Gladly. He's in Norway. And of course, behind him... There are all these Easter eggs throughout the film. And Easter eggs, I've learned, are not actually Easter eggs. They're, um... Look at that! All in-camera. See? Sometimes you don't need a very huge budget to make a movie. Unless you're making this movie. The, um... The Easter eggs, I found out, are little things from comics and from other films and stuff that are, you know, for the fans and people who know this universe. They'll see them and they'll say, "Oh, what, yeah, "did you see that they had the Drinks Tray of Knowledge "from this other, you know, comic run?" Or, like, "Did you see they had the Mirror of Disappointment "from Doctor Strange, Episode 16?" Episode? Issue. So, I'll be honest. If there are any Easter eggs in this movie, I would not really know what they are. There are a couple here and there, you know. There's, wait a minute, once we get to Sakaar, but, um... They're for you. I don't know anything about any Easter eggs in this scene. Tom did that stunt all by himself. Not. - Thank you very much for your help. - Good luck. Now things are about to get really intense. You think you're some kind of sorcerer? I don't wanna ruin it for you, but look at that. Whoa! Now they're in a field in Norway. Now, I don't know how much I'm allowed to say, but I'll tell you this. That is not Anthony Hopkins urinating off a cliff. He's just standing there, even though I know it looks a little bit like it. Not fun fact, this was not shot in Norway. This was shot in Atlanta where they do not have cliffs like that, overlooking the ocean. But, you know, hey, if I hadn't said that, would you know? Would you have known? Maybe. This was a scene that we actually kind of ended up reshooting or shooting a different way. I don't like saying reshooting, but this was part of the additional photography and originally we had Odin living in New York and the boys went and found him in New York, but just for one reason or another, that didn't work out for the story we were telling and we ended up redoing a lot of the scene here. And part of the reason we redid this was you know, we needed some expositional stuff. We needed a few different lines of dialogue to explain certain things, but mainly to explain Hela and who she is. Cate's character, who's about to come. Spoiler! Cate Blanchett's in the movie. No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur. No. It has already begun. She's coming. WAITITI: So, this is usually the point where I run out of things to say in directors' commentaries, but, no, Thor: Ragnarok is too special. This is the point where I ramp things up, where things just get crazy and I start telling you stuff that I've never told anyone. Not about the movie, about myself. I have dreams and nightmares, and sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweats just not knowing what I'm doing with my life. Ugh! This is not really the time or place to tell you guys this stuff, so maybe I'll stick to the movie, but I just want you to know that even heroes like me... Legends, absolute legends, like me, you know, that we are also tormented souls, you know, and a lot of this creativity, I think, comes from my torment and those nightmares and those cold sweats. Not that this is a great example of where we used a lot of concept art and visual development, but a big shout out has to go to Andy Park and his team at Marvel for a lot of the, a lot of the drawings and conceptual art that we took as great inspiration for costume design and for set design and things like that. And you're about to see the villain of the film turning up and the costume and the look for her that was... A huge part of that has to go to Andy Park and also Ryan Meinerding. They are two great painters, two great artists who work at Marvel and have worked there for a long time. We also had, and this scene in particular, is one that was storyboarded really well. A lot of the scenes, and definitely the action sequences in the film were storyboarded by Todd Harris and Michael Jackson. Now, I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. You look in the credits at the end of the movie, you'll see the names. Todd Harris and, yes, Michael Jackson. He was an incredible artist and, turns out, still is. So, this here is the introduction of one of my favorite people, not only as an actor, but also as a villain. Cate Winslet, I mean, Blanchett. So, she... She was one of the first people to sign on to this film. Yeah, I tricked her into doing it. But such are my powers of convincibility that she just took one look at me and said, "I'm in. I'll do it. "You're my hero." Perhaps we can come to an arrangement. This, all the suit and everything, is loosely inspired by the comic, the suit that Hela wore in the comics. The weapons that she uses, for those Thor fans out there, I am confirming right now, yes, they are based on Gorr's weapons from the God of Thunder run. Gorr being the... The dark, the God killer villain in that run. And this here is a very sad moment for people who like tools. I bet there are a lot of builders out there, a lot of carpenters. Yeah. Hearts just broke right then. So, a perfectly good hammer being crushed by Cate Blanchett. And now we see her transforming into more of the classic Hela look. That's her headpiece there. They're antlers. Which, let's be honest, would make it very hard to go through conventional doorways. Loki! But, luckily for Hela, she avoids doorways. Luckily in Asgard, doorways are very wide. So, what's great about this film, I think is just seeing Thor getting his ass kicked all the time. He's a very strong character, but we wanted to put him through his paces. We wanted to strip him down and, you know, just really, like, take him back to being powerless and having to go up against someone more formidable and dangerous than he's ever met. Now we see Hela absorbing her power from Asgard. She gets her power from Asgard and now she's in her green suit. And this is the classic Hela look from the comics. The Goddess of Death is back in Asgard. I'm Hela. So, those people that she just killed, two of the Warriors Three, Fandral and Volstagg, played by Zachary Levi and Ray Stevenson. Now we see the teaming up of the villain and her right-hand man. So, Hela and Skurge. And Hela is now in Asgard. Well, stone me crows, mate. What is gonna happen next? I'll tell you what's gonna happen next. We're gonna throw focus to the sword, then we're gonna boom up and crane in, past the sword, and into outer space, and zoom-zam-zing, off we go through the cosmos. And this is really where all the design stuff starts really taking off with this new world that we find ourselves on. Sakaar. Now, Sakaar is a sort of collection point, a meeting point for a myriad of wormholes and it's like a dumping ground for the universe where you find all the lost things, all the things that disappear in outer space. Well, they end up in wormholes somewhere along the line and a lot of it ends up here in Sakaar. So it's like a place where... It's like a giant junk planet and life is cheap and people scavenge for whatever falls from the sky. These gifts from God. And one of these gifts to the people of Sakaar is Thor. So, Thor's now found himself here and all of this world, we took a huge amount of inspiration from Jack Kirby, the great artist, the king of comic art. So, this design here, that ship, is a Kirby spaceship. You know, we made it that it breaks up into these different shapes. There are other things. Other little, you know, I guess, Kirby Easter eggs throughout the film where you'll see certain designs or certain shapes and things like... For instance, later on, someone has a gun, a laser rifle, which is actually a space station that Kirby drew many years ago. And we took that design and turned it into a weapon. So, you find throughout this entire world there's all this Kirby art everywhere. And it made me really happy to be bringing his, yeah, his spirit and his designs into the film because I've been a huge fan of his ever since I was a kid. And it's really, not only the shapes, but also the colors as well. These vibrant colors and these mixes of you know, just cool, amazing, strong lines and bold colors. Now we have the introduction of the most wonderful character, Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson. And usually in these movies... He's mine. These characters come in and they just kick everyone's ass and they look really cool, and we wanted to do something different where the introduction of this character was... Wait! ...really unpredictable and we showed that she was... And also with this movie, that it wasn't gonna be the same as, as every other movie, you know. She falls off that gang plank. She's a drinker. She's... She is more of a kind of renegade, just like, you know... She's found herself living on Sakaar somehow. And one thing you'll find when we arrive in Sakaar, the music changed quite a lot. And we introduced a lot more of these synthesizers and you know, it's more of that electronic feel to the soundtrack and to the compositions. And that is... All of that was made by Mark Mothersbaugh, who's a great musician and composer who... When I first talked to him about doing this job, he said, "I want these "old synthesizers and this, kind of, really different feel, "but I also wanna keep it "not too modern. I want it to feel like this kind of old, "sort of, this Jean-Michel Jarre kind of soundscapes "and when we get to Sakaar." So he went and pulled out all these old Moogs and stuff, one synth that Robert Moog had actually given to him many, many years ago. And also all these different synthesizers and all this cool electronic sound. It's all done on these old analog synths. It's one of my favorite things of the movie. One of my favorite elements of the movie is this music. Then we started weaving it together between the Sakaarian soundscape and the Asgardian music, which is more traditionally a score. We started interweaving them throughout the film. The Asgardian music might start sounding like it's got a few more synths in it as well. And we start blending the two worlds together. (SIGHS) Okay. Now, this scene here is Hela doing a long speech and then, really showing her powers and just why, I guess, they call her the Goddess of Death. This was something, when we were writing this. We were talking to Eric Pearson, the writer, and this was something also that Craig Kyle and Chris Yost and Stephanie Folsom... Everyone agreed. And everyone right from the very beginning, wanted to make her the most formidable villain that we've ever seen and most definitely that Thor's ever encountered. This was the scene here really where we wanted to show that. Yeah, I think we've done that job. We've pulled that off. What she, what the character does in the scene, I really loved seeing Cate do that, seeing a female villain do this, but also something right from the beginning when I was talking to Cate about doing this role, she had said, "I would just love to do "some cool action, some fun things, like I wanna punch a few people." Yeah, I think we've kind of gone further than that, but... This whole scene, all these amazing stunts and all this action was all choreographed by Ben Cooke, who's our stunt coordinator and also our second unit director. So, now you'll see where he's really come in and put his mark on this whole sequence. Of course, we mustn't ever forget, a lot of this great stunt work that we see Hela doing is also performed by the great Zoe Bell who is a New Zealand stunt woman. She's done a lot of work on Tarantino films. She's one of the best in the biz. She came in and doubled Cate for a lot of the film. So, yeah, some of these amazing moves that you see are performed by her. She's a great friend and a great performer and a really great actor, too. Now here, we're about to see the demise of the third of the Warriors Three. Is he though? Is he one of the Warriors Three? He is one of the Warriors Three. So, this is... This is Hogun, played by Tadanobu Asano. I've loved this guy for many years from afar. He's never known. I just never felt brave enough to tell him. From New Zealand. Again, this is what Ragnarok is. It's the destruction of everything you've known and come to love. We got rid of the Warriors Three within the first half an hour of the film. Oh, this mysterious figure! What's he doing? He's stolen the Bifrost sword! Now we find ourselves in outer space, and this was an audience favorite and a studio favorite. This little sequence, this little ride, his introduction to Sakaar. We were very fortunate enough to get this iconic piece of music. I can't remember what it's called, that's how iconic it is. But it's from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. (SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYING) Surrounded by cosmic gateways... If you know that movie, then you'll know this bit of music. Gene Wilder. Love Gene Wilder. I take Chris... Chris Hemsworth is the Gene Wilder of Byron Bay in Australia. - FEMALE ANNOUNCER: You are loved. - What the hell? And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster. He is the original. The first lost and the first found. The creator of Sakaar and father of the Contest of Champions. Where once you were nothing, now you are something. You are the property of the Grandmaster. Congratulations. You will meet the Grandmaster in five seconds. Prepare yourself. Prepare yourself. You are now meeting the Grandmaster. (SCREAMING) WAITITI: Oh, look. Him. Jeff Goldblum. So, Jeff Goldblum is playing the Grandmaster. Jeff has become a very dear friend to me. But not as dear as that person on the left there. Rachel House, who has been in most of my movies. She was in Eagle vs Shark. She's in Boy, playing the fantastic Aunty Gracey, and in Hunt for the Wilderpeople. She plays Paula, the social welfare worker who's on the hunt for Ricky Baker. I love Rachel, I think she's just one of the most versatile actors. She plays the grandmother in Moana. She's really... She's just so... She's so good and consistent and funny, and I'll keep trying to put her in all my movies. Pay this lady. Just wait a damn minute! WAITITI: I don't know if you noticed that thing that is on Thor's neck. That tiny little coin-shaped thing, that thing there. It's called an obedience disk and that comes from the comics, from the Planet Hulk comics. Essentially, what that does is, it's like when Thor loses his hammer on Earth, it takes away all his power and puts him on more of an even playing field with everyone else on Sakaar. So, not only does he not have his hammer but he's also been rendered powerless by this obedience disk. The Grandmaster is able to control him. He can barely harness any lightning. Just a few sparkles. So the whole point of this was really just to put him on the back foot and, because he's a god, he's the God of Thunder, it's very hard to believe that he can be beaten in a fight. So, it's more fun when you see a character like that stripped down and he's become more like everyone else. This guy here, Steven, who plays the cousin, he is a really great comic actor from Australia. I discovered him on a TV show called Black Comedy, which is an aboriginal sketch comedy show. He was part of some of my favorite sketches that I'd seen and just invited him up to come and do this small part. If you look at the extras on the DVD, there's an extended version of the scene which was so hilarious, but for time, you just can't put everything you love into a movie. And of course, it's Jeff Goldblum. We're gonna have to get him to play music. He was playing an actual keyboard throughout the scene. Then we changed the instrumentation and stuff. But this whole time that he was talking, there's a keyboard there that he would be tinkering around on during the scene. Then, oh, him. Brother Loki. Loki! Loki! A lot of these characters you'll see in the background there are taken directly from Kirby's designs. There were some characters that were just pulled straight out of the comics and we've sort of done our own things, too, but all of those kind of designs, those crazy Aztec-style helmets and stuff, all of that is all influenced by him. This whole world, Sakaar, yeah, this was our chance to really pay homage to Kirby. And just really go there with all of these looks. Traditionally, the Grandmaster is blue, but one of the fears were, by making Jeff Goldblum blue, would be that people might think he was resurrecting his character from Earth Girls are Easy. Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal. You wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg... Asgard! Any contender who defeats... WAITITI: So we gave him a little strip, a little blue strip, which just hints at it. Sometimes, all you need is a hint. Am I right? That's what I call, contender. Now, we're about to meet probably the most popular character to ever grace the screens of a Marvel film. By grace, I do mean grace. So this other character here, this rock guy, his name is Korg, and he's played by Taika Waititi, who is one of the great, great New Zealand actors. Miek, over there, he was performed by one of our stuntmen, who was an expert in Wushu and all of these amazing, acrobatic fighting styles. So there were just two of us there who were wearing these MoCap suits, those fractal suits, which look really ridiculous. Every time I was directing in one of those suits I felt more and more ridiculous. But I'm really happy now, seeing the final product. Because if it was just me in there in those pajamas, it wouldn't be quite as impressive as how Korg is in the film. What we wanted from Korg, and Korg, incidentally, and Miek, they both come from the Planet Hulk run as well. What we wanted from Korg was just someone who could look intense and strong and formidable and like he might fight Thor, but to be just a real sweetheart. We wanted him to... I based him a little bit on the bouncers in Auckland, at nightclubs in New Zealand. Polynesian bouncers who are like huge, huge dudes but they're the nicest people. They got this really kind of beautiful, light nature to them because they don't wanna hurt anyone, even though they could break your neck with one hand. I really like the concept behind this, what you're about to see, where we're showing that what we think about Asgard and what we think of the history of Asgard. Look at these lies. It's all a charade. Cha-raid? Charade? Oh, look, there's Odin and Thor partying with some girls. And Odin and Laufey, the Frost Giant, was it? I think that's Loki's dad. I wanted to show that all societies and all worlds, they all have histories. Asgard's no exception. They used to... Odin and Hela used to be the great conquerors of the cosmos and they would go around and they would just conquer and take over these worlds. They would take, a lot of the resources that they would take, came back to Asgard. That's how they built the palace and that's where all the gold came from. Through one reason or another, Odin changed his ways. And realized that peace was a way better thing to strive for. But Hela, who was brought up on the battlefield and was a conqueror, and was basically raised as a conqueror, couldn't let that go and wanted to keep spreading their empire and keep conquering and keep taking worlds. What I love about this... There! There's a little Easter egg for you. That gauntlet, that bejeweled gauntlet, which appeared in Thor 1 and had a lot of the fans speculating as to why was that gauntlet there. We thought it was necessary to explain to everyone that it was a fake. I like to think that Odin had that fake gauntlet in his weapons vault, so that people of the universe would think that it was safe and that he had it. Whereas, as we now know from the other Avengers films and from everything that we know about Thanos, that the true gauntlet is still out there and the true Infinity gems are still out there waiting to be collected. So, one of the criticisms that Hela has about Odin is that of his secrets and the shame that he felt over her and all the conquering that they used to do. One of his things is he would just keep covering things up, like that big mural, he'd cover it up with a sort of saccharine painting, with parties, and tea parties and garden parties, and peace treaties. Whereas the real Asgard, as Hela would put it, lies beneath and so beneath the floor of the weapons vault. This is where he stored Hela's old army who she now brings back to life with the Eternal Flame. And one of the great, one of the great allies to Hela is the wolf, Fenris, who, of course, comes from the comics. This is a nice scene. One of the, um... One of the things we focused on a lot in this film was really developing that arc between Thor and Loki. We really wanted to make sure that what they'd been through throughout the other films, that it would really pay off. They've had such a complex relationship over those films that we wanted to develop it further and by the end of the film, make that a really satisfying thing to have gone along on that journey over so long. I think that's one of the big parts of this film is really the story of Loki and Thor and them reaching some understanding and them reaching some sort of resolution. She's stronger than you. You don't stand a chance. Do you understand what I'm saying here? (SCOFFS) WAITITI: I like to think that those little bits of graffiti back there are like normal messages that you'd see in toilets on Earth. Things like "Barry sucks," and, "For a good time, call 02166332." You faked your own death... you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power... I think the art department did a great job there of making all those symbols and stuff. Because it does, it absolutely says to me those are alien writings. Look at that, it's like little crop circles there. Maybe that's what crop circles are. They're just aliens that have come to Earth and just tagged fields. They're saying like, "We came here. "It was just a boring wheat field, "so we went back into outer space." He's freaking gone. WAITITI: "Steven and Zorg were here." "2017." KORG: Oh, yuck! There's still someone's hair and blood all over this! Guys, can you clean up the weapons? WAITITI: Chris and I had a good time improvising a lot, ad-libbing. This scene here, we do a lot of stuff with this scene. We went through all these different weapons. We had a lot of fun doing that. I think that's what gives this film a certain flavor. A lot of the time, we would just allow ourselves and allow the other actors to ad-lib a line, to come up with ideas on the spot and just to be a bit more playful. This whole scene here developed over a couple of weeks before we shot it. Chris and Eric got together and wrote this stuff about pulling this hammer up and all this kind of ridiculous stuff which I never thought would even be in the movie. (CHUCKLING) But, it's in the movie! But that's what I think makes the film great. It can go from irreverence like that, and then into something serious, like him trying to get home, back to Asgard and learning about Valkyrie. This sort of swings between humor and drama all the time. Hey. That little move she does with that beer bottle is a little homage to Once Were Warriors, this great New Zealand film, where Beth Heke opens all the beer bottles with a fish slice. My God, you're a Valkyrie. I designed that tattoo. There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women. WAITITI: I'm gonna get it on my face after this commentary. It's more of a respectful appreciation. I think it's great. WAITITI: That little robot there is called Beer Bot 2000? Beer Bot 5000. Beer Bot 5000. And believe it or not, that is played by someone in a MoCap suit. His name was Hamish. And he was in Hunt for the Wilderpeople. He's a very funny guy, he's a comedian from back home, from New Zealand. And we turned him into a robot. And no one escapes this place. WAITITI: Here comes one of my favorite shots of the movie. It is this one! Oh, cameo alert! Now don't you move! My hands aren't as steady as they used to be. WAITITI: Stan Lee. I think it's one of the funniest of all the Stan Lee cameos. ...the wrath of the mighty Thor! WAITITI: So good, and he was such a trouper. He came in and he's a natural. The guy's just so good. He was just so funny. He has a sort of real presence. And I was really awestruck when I met him. It was one of my big celebrity star-struck moments. Meeting Stan Lee. Please, I'm your host. Big round of applause for all of our... WAITITI: So now we have Valkyrie turning up in her spaceship, the War Song. What a show! What a night! Which is a name taken from a poem about the Valkyrie. Usually, in the comics, she would have a flying horse called Aragorn. Fun fact 2,721. The big mural in the back of this is an actual piece of Jack Kirby art. GRANDMASTER: I'll say no more, see what you think. WAITITI: Fun fact 3,022. (AUDIENCE BOOING AND SHOUTING) Chris has had a haircut. I thought it was a great idea to give Chris a haircut. I think part of it for him was he was sick of wearing a wig all the time. But I actually think... Again, this whole idea of reinventing everything, it's really great for the character. He looks way better, I think. And if you look at the sides of his head, one side, there's an "N," the other side is like a "Zed," or a"Z." And what does that spell? NZ. Or NZed, New Zealand. It's like Chris did a little homage to me. It's like he was just tipping his cap to me. That's how much he loves me. GRANDMASTER: He's the reigning. WAITITI: Uh, yeah, Thor's wearing his helmet. There you go, fans. You've been asking for years. You got it. I gave it to you. Oh, did you see that guy? There's a three-headed guy in that prison cell there. You only get a few glimpses of him now and then. But whenever you see him, there's three heads looking at you. Yeah, not this guy. But those three heads, the one on the far right, that's my face. Spoiler alert, the Incredible Hulk is in this movie. Don't know if you guys were aware of that, but there he is. And the Incredible Hulk, obviously, is played by? Bruce Banner. Correct. Who's an amazing actor. And yes, we all know, it's Mark Ruffalo. Now, Mark did all this MoCap himself. So this is, yeah, this is mainly Mark here just doing all of his expressions and everything and all the action stuff, all that movement stuff. He does all those little nuances, all those little kind of character things. All get picked up when you do motion capture. So, essentially, you are seeing the actor except that he's now nine or ten feet tall and green. Banner! Hey, Banner! No Banner. Only Hulk. Oh. Fun fact 634,022. "He's a friend from work" was actually not a line that either of us came up with or anyone on the film. It was actually a line from a kid who came to visit set. I guess it was like the Win-A-Wish foundation where they give set visits to kids and stuff. So the line, "He's a friend from work" was actually given to us by a kid who was visiting set. He was hanging outwith Chris all day and we were about to go and do another take. And then he whispers to Chris, he goes, "Hey, you know what you should say when you see the Incredible Hulk?" "You should say, 'He's a friend from work!" He did, and it became this huge thing and now it's on t-shirts and everything, on posters and it's in the trailer. - So full credit to that kid. - (BABY COOING) Talking about kids, this is my kid. Yeah, if you hear a little voice throughout some of this. This is Matua, my daughter, who's just come to help me out for a little bit. How you doing? Good? What is that? - (MATUA BABBLING) - (WAITITI LAUGHS) Yeah. Do you know who that is? That's the Incredible Hulk. There's Uncle Chris, there's Uncle Hulk. He does Hulk Smash. Oh, there you go, the ragdoll moment, which is another fan favorite. Of course, it happened to Loki in Avengers 1. Then we got to do it to Thor. - (MATUA BABBLING) - Yeah, exactly. (CONTINUES BABBLING) Yeah, Hulk smash, Hulk smash. All right. Screw it. MATUA: Uh-oh. WAITITI: Yeah. - MATUA: Be gentle. - Be gentle. MATUA: This why? I know you're in there, Banner. I'll get you out! WAITITI: Yeah. He's angry. (ROARS) MATUA: Uh-oh. Somebody's angry. WAITITI: Yeah, really angry. Because what we tried to do in this... - MATUA: Yes. - Yeah. - (MATUA BABBLING) - WAITITI: Mmm-hmm. We wanted to show... This idea of Hulk and Thor fighting has been a big point of debate for many years... MATUA: Yes. WAITITI: ...for all the fans. So it's always online, and on the blogs and stuff, they're always like, "Oh, who would win in a fight between Hulk and Thor?" Yeah, we put them together and we made them have this big fight. And I wanted to show that Thor... Because everyone was like, "Hulk's the strongest thing in the universe." But Thor's a god. They're both, I think, equally as strong as each other. And plus, Thor's got' - lightning. - MATUA: (GASPS) Uh-oh. - Wow. - MATUA: Uh-oh. WAITITI: Yeah. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Hulk's in trouble. Oh, here we go. Electric Man. Captain Electric. What do you think is gonna happen here, bubba? And here's a big punch. MATUA: Oh, my gosh! (WAITITI LAUGHS) The Hulk Smash very angry. WAITITI: Yeah, Hulk Smash very angry. Thunder! Thunder! Thunder! MATUA: He's fall down. WAITITI: Yeah. Ooh! - Yeah. - MATUA: Uh-oh. WAITITI: There's a lot of uh-oh moments in this film. - MATUA: Oh, my gosh! - Yeah. Look, you just missed me. Missed my little face there. (MATUA BABBLING) MATUA: (GASPS) Uh-oh. Oh, my gosh! WAITITI: It's amazing? - MATUA: (WHIMPERS) No. - (WAITITI LAUGHS) - Scary. - WAITITI: Scary? - MATUA: Uh-oh. Here comes another one. - Mmm-hmm. Another one. Tell me about yourself, Skurge. Did I tell you, Matua, that the design here, that's all like Ra Vincent and Dan Hennah? MATUA: On, my gosh! WAITITI: Oh, my gosh! MATUA: I wanna look at this one. WAITITI: What one? MATUA: My grown-up one. - You're gonna see the grown-up one? - MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: You wanna go and see something else? MATUA: Yeah, something else. (WAITITI LAUGHS) I was Odin's executioner. (MATUA SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) WAITITI: Okay, so I'm back now. Matua's gone now, she went to see something else. She wasn't really interested in this film. Let's begin our conquest. I was gonna comment just then on Gungnir. Did you guys see Gungnir, which is Odin's spear, just behind Hela on that seat? Skurge, where's the sword? I think Gungnir's gonna make a reappearance later on in the movie. HELA: That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost. WAITITI: That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost and we're about to find out who actually has it. Who are those thieves? It's not them, they don't have the sword. Look at this beautiful forest. This is all Australia. We achieved so many of these different looks in Australia and, I must say working at that studio there... Well, ho-ho-ho! Who's this? Bob Marley. Excuse me. WAITITI: So Idris calls me up and he goes, "Hello, mate, yeah, I think I've got a, uh..." "What do you think we should do with the hair in this one?" I was, like, "I don't know, what do you think?" "What about dreadlocks?" Come on. I like to think that Heimdall's been living in the forest after being, after being banished by... Well, not banished. After being arrested by Odin in Thor 2 and he somehow, he escaped and didn't turn up for his trial and he's been living up here in the forest this entire time. And he's been waiting for it all to go down because I think he could tell... I like to think he could tell that Hela was on her way back. And so he went up there and he opened up the old stronghold from the old days where he would look after all the Asgardians who were on the run. And here they all are living up here in this giant... What do you call this? Stronghold? A stronghold. Oh, look. Look at these nurses. All these women nursing Thor back to health. Would you like to hear fun fact 8,024 million and 82? Two of those nurses played by mine and Chris's wives. Elsa and Chelsa. Obligatory torso and arm shot there. I will have you know that Chris wasn't planning on doing any topless scenes in this film. And I, as a representative of the audience, I said to him, "You have to." "What is the point of doing all that work "and training so hard if you're not gonna show that off?" I said, "Chris, you get out there, dude, and you show it off." And I would like to acknowledge myself and Chris' body for those extra ticket sales that have occurred because of those shots. Winning. You mean cheating, huh? Were they wearing one of these when you won? How'd you arrive here? WAITITI: Look how good Hulk looks. He looks like General Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. Doesn't he? Does he? You're not answering. Okay, well, this here was not my idea. Hey, you're back! Quinjet. Yes! I'm getting us out of here. This is a terrible, awful place. You're gonna love Asgard. It's big. It's golden. Shiny. Hulk stay. No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard. We must prevent Ragnarok. Ragnarok? The prophesied death of my home world. The end of days, it's the end of... (YAWNING) If you help me get back to Asgard, I can help you get back to Earth. Huh? - Earth hate Hulk. - What have you been doing today? They love you. You're one of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends. WAITITI: Anything? You know, to anything. What do two-year-olds get up to in LA? Banner's friend. I don't even like Banner. "I'm into numbers and science and stuff." WAITITI: What do two-year-old's get up to? Do you have fun? Do you ever do fun things? That is Thor and Hulk. When you were last here, they were having a big fight. Now they're talking it out. MATUA: I wanna go see Mommy. WAITITI: Yeah, okay, fine. You didn't smash anything. I won that fight. WAITITI: You wanna go see the grown-ups? Well, that's insulting. - What? - Baby. WAITITI: Bye! Thor go! - I am going. - (ALARM BEEPS) WAITITI: Okay, well, she's gone. Again. God, they're fickle, aren't they? Where was I? Well, I was trying to explain to my daughter that we'd seen Hulk and Thor having a big argument, a big fight, then they were trying to talk it out, trying to talk through their differences. Of course it ends in another argument. But talking is way better than fighting, and I think that's one of the big messages of Thor. And one of the messages I'm trying to instill into my two-year-old. You know, it's, like, sure we can try and sort it out with our fists, but why don't we try and sort it outwith our voices and our ideas, and our understanding, first and foremost. And if that doesn't work, then with our fists. Help me see. WAITITI: So, now... Have you worked out what's going on? Thor is using Heimdall's eyes and Heimdall's magic to transport back to Asgard, not physically, but in a sort of a, let's see, in a sort of an illusion. Sort of like his spirit has kind of gone back there. So he can see what's going on and see the effects of Hela's occupation of Asgard. But he's not actually there so he's still trapped in Sakaar. Come on. This is when we find out that they've gotta get... They've gotta get rid of Hela or they've gotta get everyone off Asgard because she will grow more and more powerful the longer she's on Asgard and she'll eventually start taking over other worlds and no one in the cosmos will be safe. (GASPING) Wow, I didn't realize that shot was the color of the American flag. (GROANS) (GRUNTS) Also the French flag. Also the British flag. And the New Zealand flag and the Australian flag. A lot of flags use red, white, and blue. Okay, you guys? So when people are talking about red, white, and blue it's not just the American flag. - I'm pissed off! - Oh. WAITITI: Now, this costume there, this wardrobe that Hulk is wearing, is a sort of... It's kind of a... What do you call this? A sort of Tibetan influence? That is also from a comic. Taken from some comic art. And we just like the idea of him just having clothes. You know, different things, we're, like... He's a hero here on Sakaar and people have designed stuff for him. And, you know, this bed, this giant bed, which Ra Vincent designed. You know, all of the stuff, you know, is all for him. And he's made quite the life here on Sakaar. And you can understand I think why he doesn't wanna go home. You know, he's a hero here. He's a champion and the crowd celebrate him. And on Earth, people run from him. No. Mmm-mmm. Literally, that two-year old that was in here before, or my five-year-old who's at school, I've had this conversation with them. It's okay. WAITITI: Me being Thor, and them being the Hulk. I know. I'm sorry. I just get so angry all the time. WAITITI: "Sorry, Dad, I just get so angry all the time." We're the same, you and I. We're just a couple of hot-headed fools. Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water. We're kind of both like fire. But Hulk like real fire. Hulk like raging fire. Thor like smoldering fire. (CHUCKLES) Hulk, I need you to do something for me. WAITITI: This here, another great wide shot of the Hulk's suite. This beautiful Kirby design. All these lines and these patterns. You're so thick-headed that you can't tell when someone's hiding all the way across the universe and wants to be left alone. - We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me. I need her to stay. Stay? WAITITI: This was one of the first scenes we shot. This was actually Tessa's first day on the film. All right. She's American. I'm not sure if you guys know that. She's American. She did a really great job with her accent and just coming in. We'd been shooting for a couple of weeks but this was her first scene. It was a really big scene and it was an emotional scene and had a lot of dialogue. But she just walked in, put her stamp on everything and just... She said, "Here I am," and blew everyone away. She was such a good actor and she completely owned that character. And she owns the scene. One thing we really wanted to have fun with was this idea of... We kind of wanted to make fun of all these movies where people are talking about getting a team together. It's, "We're getting the team together! We're gonna, oh yeah!" Thor, having been with the Avengers, is obsessed with this idea of inspiring people by getting the team together and he's always trying to make the team. Later on, when we see the Revengers thing, I think that pays off so well. There's so many little things there throughout the film, especially for Chris and he's so good at what he does and he's so good at making fun of himself... Don't get familiar. ...that all those little jokes and stuff that we've spread throughout the scene, they're all very irreverant and often try and subvert this idea of what we've become used to in these superhero movies. - Good. Great. - Great. But Chris is a legitimately funny actor. All those things that we've come to expect from these kind of heroes, he managed to play the opposite in this film. And a classic example of that is right here obviously. I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them. Because that's what... WAITITI: And again, there you have it, just with the way he jumps up and straight back into it. There's that kind of bravado that you come to love from heroes. When I first came in to do this film, I'd been talking to Marvel and we all agreed that... Friend, stay! ...Thor needed a little bit of an overhaul and he needed to be that kind of fun hero that we wanted to follow on the journey. I don't think you can do that when your hero is super earnest and serious. Chris really managed to completely change Thor in a way where he retained some of that old, obviously, that Asgardian presence, but the character has been on Earth for a couple of years. He's hung out with Tony Stark. He knows sarcasm. He knows irony. It's a lot of... I think we've done a really good job of making him, making Thor the best character in the film. - (BEEPS) - COMPUTER: Access denied. (IN DEEP VOICE) Strongest Avenger. - (BEEPS) - Access denied. (SIGHS) Damn you, Stark. Point Break. - Welcome, Point Break. - (CHUCKLES) WAITITI: Point Break obviously. A reference to Avengers. - Stay! - No, no, no! Stop! - Stay! - (QUINJET POWERS DOWN) Stop! Stop breaking everything! Don't go! WAITITI: What happens here, this is actually one of the moments in the film that I love the most and that I'm the most proud of. And that's this transformation. The fact that he's... He is in conflict with Banner and Banner's in conflict with Bruce and they're both fighting over this body. This is a kind of almost like Altered States. Almost like that moment when William Hurt is changing. So this is a really emotional moment here though. You see the two of them battling it out. I know there's a little bit more of that conflict and that duality that's gonna evolve between Banner and the Hulk in upcoming movies. That's it, breathe. (EXHALES) I won't hurt you. WAITITI: Of course, there's Mark Ruffalo. Some creepy old man cut it off. - It looks good. - Oh, thanks. Where are we? Oh, how's Nat? - Uh, Nat is good, I'm sure. - Is she okay? - And what about Sokovia? - Sokovia? The city, Sokovia. Did we save it? WAITITI: These two work so great together. - What are you saying? - Well... What? I've been Hulk for two... WAITITI: They're really, one of my... One of the things I was looking at when I first came on was sort of to use as a bit of inspiration was Withnail and I. It's a great British film... Banner. ...with Richard E. Grant. Just with the idea, when Marvel first said, "It's like a kind of... "It might be a little bit like a road trip, a buddy flick, "I wanna get these characters together." Look at that cool shot. Thor, where are we? That was something I had in my mind was one of the great British comedies about these two actors who were out in the country on a holiday. He kind of runs the place. What I really wanted from Chris and Mark was just to have these two guys and they're not at all like those personalities from that film. - Doesn't sound right. - Well, it's true. I feel like this film just shifts into a whole new gear when Mark comes into it. Because he's so fun and he's so great to watch. And with him and Chris coupled together, I feel like the whole film just, the energy picks up and it just turns into this whole other thing. And just the way that they would ad-lib together and the way that they would do these scenes. We've got very, very long takes that never made it into the film where they would just riff off each other and just go for it. This one was seven or eight-minute takes where they were just talking and talking and some of that stuff is some of the greatest comedy and greatest acting I've seen in a long time. GRANDMASTER: I'm upset! WAITITI: And that shot there. Obviously the greatest shot in the history of cinema, designed by Todd Harris, our storyboard artist. Even then when he came in with that shot of Valkyrie and Loki entering and the camera sweeps over the top of them and then we look into the reflection of the floor and see the Grandmaster coming down. Even when he presented that shot to us, he said, "I think this is the greatest shot in the history of cinema." And so now that's what... That's how we know... That's what we've come to affectionately call that crazy shot. This here is another moment when Jeff managed to ad-lib for a good four or five minutes on a few different things and just for pacing reasons, we couldn't put it in the final movie, but it will be an extra scene. But he's just, when he's on fire and he's just going for it, it's quite amazing. It's quite amazing to see this guy. What have you done? I don't answer to you, lackey. It's Loki. And you will answer to the Grandmaster. - (GRUNTS) - Hmm. Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool? I don't help anyone. WAITITI: These guys duking it out. Valkyrie and Loki. The thing that's about to come up though is something so amazing. And it's never been done in film before. And this flashback. What I'm talking about is this flashback. I'm not talking about flashbacks. I know flashbacks have been done on film before. But, the style of lighting in this. This lighting effect in this little flashback here was designed and invented by two friends of mine I went to school with. Carlo Van de Roer and Stu Rutherford. And Stu Rutherford actually, fun fact five million, Stu Rutherford plays Stu in What We Do in the Shadows. They've both been childhood friends of mine. They invented this almost bullet-time lighting where you set up an array of lights over a hundred lights. They're all strobes. They're all gonna flash once or twice. They all set off. They all go off one after each other in quick succession and the whole thing happens in less than a second. And then you film those little bits of footage with a very high speed camera. So instead of the camera wrapping around like in The Matrix, it's the lights that are wrapping around, so it casts these huge shadows everywhere, across the walls. And it's an effect that can only be achieved by setting up the lights that way. Now you've been on two. That's a good thing. Yeah, I'm really proud of those guys and I'm really stoked that I managed to get that in the film. ...my brain can handle the information. The whole thing is totally different... WAITITI: We have a classic Nagel, Naa-gull, Nay-gull illustration on Banner's T-shirt which actually happens to be Tony Stark's T-shirt. So Banner's now wearing Tony Stark's clothes. I love that image of this guy in a Duran Duran T-shirt on an alien planet and an '80s suit jacket. And Thor and a space Viking. I mean, how much more fun can a movie get? Okay, that is so wrong on so many... WAITITI: Answer? About 84% more fun. Because it just keeps going. I'm sick of it. - What? - I just told you. If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again. And you don't care. No, no. I'm putting together the team. The Hulk is the fire. Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk. - What? No! - It's gross. You don't care about me. You're not my friend. No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like, "Smash, smash, smash." I prefer you. Thanks. But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful... WAITITI: I'm currently looking through the window of this recording booth at my daughter who is playing "Who's trying to steal a phone" from the technician. Someone needs to supervise their child. Maybe the technician can just supervise her. - I'll be Tony Stark. - What? Yeah. Tony and the gypsy. WAITITI: And now the look is complete. Bruce Banner as Tony Stark. Tony Stark and a gypsy. What are you doing? Stop doing that! Tony wears his pants super tight. - Stop it! - I'm sorry. - Why are you being so weird? - I don't know. WAITITI: I really wanted to make fun of Tony Stark's clothes because I think in some of those movies, they seem very funny to me. Some of the funny T-shirt designs and his funky trendy clothes that he always wears. Uh-oh. Trying to keep your mind off the Incredible Hulk. Bad move, we just walked into a Hulk festival. Banned! Banned! WAITITI: We had a lot of interns working on the film in the art department making all of these Hulk masks and Hulk banners and everything. A lot of them were from the local Aboriginal community who came in and we wanted to give them a chance to come and work on a film and to see what it's like on film sets. Because when I was growing up in New Zealand I had never been on a film set before. I think having any of those experiences when you're young can really inspire you and it can change your life. They did really well and some of them continued to work for the art department. They managed to get jobs out of this experience. Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe? WAITITI: These two made this up on the day. All this flirtatious stuff was just made up on the spot. Who is this guy? WAITITI: And I like to think it makes it just that little bit more genuine. Here's one of the great moments in cinema right here. This shot and this shot. As a filmmaker, I don't mind telling you that something this simple is sometimes all you need. You don't need fancy camera moves. Just lock it off and have them stare as close to the barrel as possible and say their damn lines. Revengers line, that was something that came up on the day. I think Chris said it was his idea. I don't know, I feel like I had a big part of that. I'm sure other people have said the Revengers instead of Avengers. So let's just all take credit for it. I've got a peace offering. WAITITI: I definitely invented vertical sliding doors though, I'll tell you that. Classic. Just had to be sure. WAITITI: And behind Banner there is an alien trash can. So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody. Where are you at these days? It varies from moment to moment. THOR: Is that a Dragonfang? It is. My God. WAITITI: Dragonfang is the famed sword of the Valkyrie, and it is famed, and it is from the comics and is her famous magical sword. ...18 months. Nope. We are going through... WAITITI: You'll see later on in the film it'll be used in the Devil's Anus. And here's a note... Who would've thought we'd make a movie with the Devil's Anus in it? MATUA: I want a coffee. - WAITITI: You want a coffee? - Yeah. WAITITI: Okay, this is... WOMAN: Would you like a coffee? WAITITI: Come on. Oh, I'd love coffee. WOMAN: Yeah, what can we get you? MATUA: Nice coffee. WAITITI: You don't drink coffee. I need to tell everyone here that you don't drink coffee. Do you drink coffee? - MATUA: Yeah. - No, you don't. WAITITI: Stay there. She doesn't. She doesn't, you guys. She doesn't drink coffee. What do you want? MATUA: I wanna drink coffee. WAITITI: No, you don't. Have some water. MATUA: No. WAITITI: You don't drink coffee. Now everyone thinks you drink coffee. They think it's a normal thing and now that I'm just... MATUA: You want coffee? WAITITI: I want coffee. Yeah. Heavens, no. I've run out of favor with... WAITITI: Jeez, Valkyrie lives like a slob, doesn't she, guys? I'm asking for safe passage through the Anus. You're telling us that you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms? Yes, brother. I can. WAITITI: We tried to fill up this film with lots of these little stories that Chris is about to tell. Just little anecdotes about him and Loki and times that Loki's tried to kill him. And so throughout the film we actually got a lot of these little things, which I personally love. Also for their relationship, I think it's really funny that ever since they were seven they've been trying to kill each other. You guys have a beast? But because they're gods obviously... THOR: We're going to start a revolution. - Revolution? - I'll explain later. - Who's this guy again? - I'll explain later. Is that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff... WAITITI: These little eggs beneath Miek. I like to think that one day they all grow into other Mieks. - Oh! - (CLATTERING) I'm looking for Korg. Who's asking? I know you're asking. Is anyone else asking, or is it just you? The Lord of Thunder sends his best. WAITITI: We shot another revolution scene after this where Korg is trying to organize his revolutionaries and they're all in the weapons vault choosing weapons. And it's just going awfully and it becomes really apparent that Korg has no idea how to run a revolution. He's actually not a natural born leader. Unlike me. I think I'm a great leader. I've got a lot of leadership quality. Lot of qualities that you'd want in a leader. Like... I'm fun, I like long walks on the beach. Um... And, um... Open communication was never our family's forte. You have no idea. And I like to sleep all the time. Hello. Hi. WAITITI: Fans love this moment. The brothers together again fighting side by side. It was actually a very satisfying part of the story, seeing these two brothers finally working together. We might as well be strangers now. Two sons of the crown, set adrift. - Oh. - (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Thought you didn't wanna talk about it. Here's the thing. I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar. That's exactly what I was thinking. Did you just agree with me? Come on, this place is perfect for you. It's savage, chaotic, lawless... Brother, you're gonna do great here. WAITITI: Spoiler: This was not shot in an elevator on another planet. Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever. But at the end of the day, you're you and I'm me. I don't know, maybe there's still good in you. WAITITI: Fun fact number seven. Chris and Tom are not actual brothers. Yeah. They're actually from different countries in fact. Although you'd never know because they look exactly the same, don't they? They look like twins. Hey, let's do "Get Help." - What? - "Get Help." No. - Come on, you love it. - I hate it. It's great. It works every time. WAITITI: How're you guys enjoying this director's commentary so far? We're not doing "Get Help." - (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) - Get help! Please! WAITITI: I looked through the window and one person gave me a thumbs-up. Another one has too. Two people so far enjoying it. Now, which one's the ship she told us to get? The Commodore. WAITITI: Okay, the Commodore. Look at that cool ship. So the coloring of that ship, I'll tell you right now, is inspired by the Aboriginal flag. So, it's red, yellow and black. Being in Australia, I was really struck by the culture there. And I brought a lot of those things, and I thought, "You know what? Let's make the hero's spaceship in this movie "the color of the original people from Australia, "the color of their flag." So when you see this thing flying through, it's like this... It's like they're escaping from Sakaar in the Aboriginal flag. It made me very proud to have those colors there. Not many people know that the coloring of Valkyrie's ship, they are the colors of the Maori flag, the native peoples of New Zealand. Nothing political, just cool. So good luck, I guess. All right, you can figure this out. WAITITI: All of these spaceships in this film are all named. This is called the Commodore. There's another great big spaceship that features later on, that's called the Statesman. All these other spaceships that join in this big Sakaarian chase... There's a Torana, there's an Escort, there's a Kingswood. These are all names of Holdens, Holden cars, which are Australia, New Zealand cars. Yeah, they're all named after the great Australian and New Zealand vehicles of the '70s, '80s, '90s and 2000s. I hope that you're tougher than you look. Why? (SCREAMING) - (GROANING) - (LAUGHS) WAITITI: I'm particularly proud of the interior of the Commodore with all the orange, all the bold colors and lines. Where are the guns on this ship? WAITITI: That just says '70s lounge suite in the form of a spaceship, to me. Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies? Yeah. WAITITI: There's actually a deleted scene. In the back there, you see this orange and white door. Beyond that is a sort of dining room set with a big round table and there's drinks cabinets and stuff, and again, it looks like a '70s lounge room. '70s dining room. Just for length, we got rid of that scene. But in the deleted scenes, we'll probably include that scene and you'll see just how great the rest of that set is. I also love the idea of them escaping from this planet in a luxury vehicle, in a vehicle designed really just for parties and drinking and orgies. I should probably go and help her. Here, take the wheel. No. I don't know how to fly one of these. Yeah, you're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs. None of them are for flying alien spaceships! WAITITI: Now we see Thor and Valkyrie dancing around these spaceships, blowing them up. If you will, it's sort of like a mating dance of these two characters. A sort of courtship, a bit like two animals impressing each other with their skills and with their peacocking. This is cool, like two gods who are jumping around destroying spaceships. I think that's pretty awesome. Come on! There's gotta be a gun on this thing. That looks like a gun. GRANDMASTER: (SINGING) It's my birthday It's my birthday It's my birthday WAITITI: I would like to release the It's My Birthday song as its own special hit. A special individual song. Instead of Happy Birthday, people could sing It's My Birthday instead. Easier. Because for Happy Birthday, you need other people to sing that for you. With It's My Birthday, you can just do it by yourself, for yourself. Now, we're about to take you into the Devil's Anus. Oh, look, there you go. There! Look! Hajo, that guy over there with the three heads. See the guy on the right? The head on the right? That's my face. A lot of these guys, or a lot of these gladiators are named after friends of mine. That guy there, the three-headed guy is called Hajo. He's named after my friend Stellan Hajo. Another character in there, the one with the sort of pancake face called Tasba, he's named after my friend Tasba. She does not have a pancake face. There's another one called Ejashi, which is named after my friend Bird. There, and there was more. There's more, I'm not gonna keep naming them all because we're in a Wormhole and we're going into Asgard! SKURGE: Asgardians! Some misguided soul has stolen the Bifrost sword. Tell us where it is... WAITITI: Sometimes when I think about this film and all the things that are in it, I feel like if you were to tell people about this, they wouldn't believe that this is actually a movie. "Yeah, no, it's got this woman with antlers in it, "and a giant wolf, "and this big angry green guy, "a space Viking, "this guy with these weird triangles on his head, "zombie army, "magical swords." You name it, we put it in the movie. "Don't do it, Skurge!" That's what I'd be yelling out, if I was in the crowd. "Come on, Skurge! Don't do it!" Well... Executioner? - (ALL GASP) - MAN: Wait! WAITITI: Oh, thank goodness someone stopped him. I know where the sword is. WAITITI: Now, we leave Sakaar behind and we have found ourselves back with our heroes in Asgard. There it is in all its glory. I never thought I'd be back here. BANNER: I thought it'd be a lot nicer. I mean, not that it's not nice. It's just, it's on fire. WAITITI: That pipe organ house is very tall, isn't it? I hope they have elevators in there. Maybe not, maybe that's why Asgardians thighs and calves are so muscular and strong. They have to walk everywhere. I have a man on the ground. (LOW INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Asgard. WAITITI: These two girls from the beginning. Do you remember them, everyone, do you remember? They were in the Observatory with Skurge. Now the ship has a gun. I'll take it from here. I found this in the armory. Good luck. WAITITI: I like how considerate Thor is. I'm eating a carrot right now as I talk to you. ...don't die. I like the fact that Thor... You know what I mean. WAITITI: He was thinking about Valkyrie, he was just like, "I'll go off and not only get a weapon. "I'll go get some clothes for her as well to inspire her. "Give her a sense of place. “Help her get her identity back. "She's been running from the truth and running from her past." He's just given her an opportunity to embrace it, to acknowledge who she is. She's a Valkyrie, an elite warrior of Asgard. Holy cow! Hela is so powerful. She just tore that mountain apart and made a bridge out of these two doors. But slightly too late. They went out the back door down there. Do you see that? Just in the nick of time. HEIMDALL: We must keep moving! WAITITI: Keep going, Asgardians! Keep going! You can tell they're exhausted, those poor Asgardians. They've been through hell. Their entire world is under siege. Uh-oh. That's right. Valkyrie. In full form! See those little griffin things on the side there? They remind me of those things in Ghostbusters. This shot here. All of this. Look how great this set looks! Those two things remind me of... I like to call them giraffe wolves. Those things and those other tall, sort of skinny-necked things on the sides, see around that big circle. A lot of the set extension and stuff... A lot of the reason so much of, so many of these shots and so many of these worlds look so good is just the integration of these human elements. These things that we shot in Australia mixed with the really tireless hard work of Jake Morrison and the VFX department that he ran. And then, one day... Him and Cyndi Ochs. It was really such a huge job, there are so many VFX shots in this film. Ran into the thousands. It really blew me away, just how much work goes into all of these shots and the integration, the texturing, the lighting. So much lighting happens in post by these VFX artists. All of Hela's antlers, all that head. What you see on Hela, the head thing, this is all CG. It's all added later on. Just absolutely amazing. Look at this. All of the stuff here were it not for the work of Jake and his team, all of this would still be blue screen. I would've been fired months ago. (GROWLING) Damn it! (SIGHS) Well... Heimdall didn't anticipate seeing that giant wolf there, did you? But, giant wolf, you didn't anticipate Valkyrie in a '70s leisure vessel and with a giant laser gun. Ah. Other Asgardians, you didn't anticipate Skurge and a zombie army stopping you from getting back to the city. A lot of people didn't anticipate stuff. (BOTH GRUNTING) To be honest, I expected more. WAITITI: Thor didn't anticipate being spun 500 times in the air like that and hitting the ground. The sword! Here's the difference between us. - I'm Odin's firstborn... - WAITITI: The moment coming up. Which is quite gruesome. I want you to prepare yourselves for it. Thor's gonna become just like his father. So simple, even a blind man could see it. But maybe that's exactly what needs to happen. Maybe that's what needed to happen for him to become the king he needs to become. (ROARING) The stupid dog won't die! (ALL SCREAMING) WAITITI: "The stupid dog won't die!" I think I wanna get that on a T-shirt. Everything's gonna be all right now. I got this. You wanted to know who I am? What the hell are you talking about? You'll see! (FENRIS SNIFFING) WAITITI: I love that moment. Really, at this point in the film, things just start getting... You think this film is pretty crazy up till now, (ROARS) but now, it just gets even more mental. "What's in your movie?" "Incredible Hulk fighting a giant wolf." "Zombies jumping on a spaceship." "Whole bunch of people trying to escape from this planet." "Antler lady ripping out the hero's eye." I'll get that sword, even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it. - (SWORDS CLASHING) - (CLAMORING) WAITITI: This whole sequence, this whole part of the film, I would say took over a month to shoot. There were a lot of extras on set all the time and in Australia, in the Gold Coast, it can get very hot. It was very... Most days, we were working in this intense heat. Hey, man. We shot for a long time and it was a huge effort, logistically and especially, for the stunt department. They really had to go for it. We got a lot of amazing fight footage. This was the first time that I'd ever done something on this kind of scale. I gotta admit... - Did you miss me? - Everyone, on that ship now. Gotta admit I would not have been able to do this alone. - (SWORDS CLASHING) - (SCREAMING) Oh, no! No! Taika gone. It's a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance. You see... I'm not a queen or a monster. WAITITI: You know what? Say Thor's the God of Thunder. But, technically, thunder isn't really lightning, is it? Thunder's the sound of lightning. So, either Thor should change his name to God of Lightning, or should we change it so that he just has the power of some really loud rumbling? He can just make his not-cool noises. I think I'm gonna write to Stan Lee and ask him what he thinks. It was never your source of strength. It's too late. She's already taken Asgard. Asgard is not a place. Never was. WAITITI: Look at the two guys with one eye each. Asgard is where our people stand. Even now, right now, those people need your help. WAITITI: I love this moment. This is the moment you want in a movie like this. The moment where it all, the big realization happens. He gets his power back. Finally, we see Thor as we've always wanted to see him. As the God of Thunder harnessing the lightning and using it and being incredible. Actually being the hero that we've been waiting to see for years now. To top it off, we bring back the greatest song in the history of the world. This here, it could not get any more Thor than right now. (IMMIGRANT SONG BY LED ZEPPELIN PLAYING) (FIREWORKS BURSTING) (ROARS) WAITITI: Again, look at this stuff. This is all VFX. That Hulk shot with Hulk and that dog and all that water and everything, it's amazing. It is amazing what they can do. I do give them full credit. That is the Statesman I was talking about before, that giant ship named after one of the Holdens. That is the Statesman. Skurge has turned and is swapping sides. He's gonna save his own skin and get out of there. One of the things with Hulk is he's such a strong character, it's how you get rid of him so that it makes it harder for the heroes to win their battle. We had to... The best thing about having Fenris there was that it keeps him occupied, gives him something to do and gets him out of the picture while Thor and Valkyrie can fight Hela. I think we should disband the Revengers. Hit her with a lightning blast. I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning. It did nothing. We just need to hold her off until everyone's on board. It won't end there. The longer Hela's on Asgard, the more powerful she grows. She'll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now. So what do we do? I'm not doing "Get Help." WAITITI: Now... One thing we really wrestled with was figuring out if we're gonna make this Ragnarok, it has to be the destruction of Asgard. We knew that that's something we were gonna run at and we were gonna try and get there. But really, the hard part is trying to justify blowing up a planet to beat the bad guy. How we really got to that point was showing that even with all the power that Thor has just harnessed, even that wasn't enough to beat Hela. And that she does get more and more powerful and she's just gonna keep going and she will never stop. And she will find a way off Asgard and spread her evil and conquer more worlds. So they couldn't escape and just leave her there. They actually have to deal with her. And if she takes her power from Asgard, then to defeat her, you have to destroy her power source, which is Asgard. It's extreme but, I mean, look at this character. She's unstoppable. (GRUNTS) WAITITI: As we learnt earlier in the movie, the Eternal Flame brings things back to life. As we learnt before, that even Surtur's soul and his spirit entered into that skull in the very first sequence of the film. So those little eggs that were laid so early on in the film are now, have been incubating and are now about to hatch. This here, this moment here is from the comic books. Skurge's last stand where he saves all the Asgardians. It's a very iconic moment in the books where he fights off the zombie army with these Earth weapons. It was nice, because for a bad guy, to see this bad guy sacrifice himself for the greater good and for the people. I think it's like a real fan favorite moment. Just good to see him redeem himself in some way. (SCREAMING) In particular, this moment here where he uses that as a baseball bat, uses that gun in that position... That's directly from a comic book frame. Now we're about to meet the big man again. Hela, enough! You want Asgard, it's yours. Whatever game you're playing, it won't work. You can't defeat me. No, I know. But he can. WAITITI: What the heck? No! (HELA GRUNTS) (RUMBLING) Tremble before me, Asgard! WAITITI: Surtur in his full might. Now this is actually from the original idea of Ragnarok, the tale of Ragnarok from Norse mythology that Surtur is here with the destruction of Asgard. He's a big part of that. Incredible Hulk is no part of that. But we need to let him finish the job, otherwise... Oh, do I hear someone coming back? Hello! MATUA: Come look at the fire! WAITITI: Look, the fire. Come here, look! (SURTUR YELLING) Big fire. Do you see? MATUA: Oh, no! WAITITI: Wow, look. MATUA: Oh, no! WAITITI: Oh, no? MATUA: Oh, no! I wanna look at the life now. I wanna come and look at the life now. I wanna come and look at the life. WAITITI: You want to come and look at the life? MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: What does that mean? "Look at the life?" MATUA: I wanna turn it off now. WAITITI: You want to turn this movie off? MATUA: Yeah. (SURTUR SCREAMING) - (SURTUR LAUGHING) - (GRUNTS) WAITITI: You wanna cover your eyes? MATUA: I'm sad to look at the eye. WAITITI: Why? Because of the big fire monster? MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: Hey, guess what. Guess what. Look at this guy. See this guy made of rocks? Hold on. This guy here. That's me. That's your dad. Your dad's made of rocks, on the inside. MATUA: Wow. WAITITI: Yeah. Now those foundations are gone. Sorry. Who do you love most out of all these people? MATUA: You. WAITITI: Yeah! MATUA: You! (WAITITI CHUCKLES) What have I done? MATUA: Come and look at the life now! WAITITI: I don't know what that means. MATUA: Come and look at it! Scary movie! WAITITI: Oh, scary movie? Do you think this is scary? MATUA: Yes, scary life. WAITITI: Scary life? Life is scary. Look, all that scariness is gone now. Now, it's just Chris Hemsworth. The movie's nearly over. And so is this amazing director's commentary. Did you enjoy learning about this film? MATUA: He's coming! Look at the life! WAITITI: Mm-hmm. Have you learnt a lot about the film by listening to this? MATUA: Come and look at the life! Come and look at the scary light! WAITITI: The light! Come and look at the light? The scary light. MATUA: What? WAITITI: The scary light. MATUA: No. I don't want to... I don't want to give it life. I want the scary life one. Not the movie guana. Not a movie guana. WAITITI: Not a movie guana? Iguana? MATUA: I wanna watch Moana. WAITITI: Oh, you wanna watch Moana? MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: Yeah. - You know I was the writer on that? - MATUA: I wanna turn it off. WAITITI: You wanna turn this off and watch Moana instead. Is that what you'd like? - Shall I do a commentary for Moana? - MATUA: Yeah. I want to... Like grown-up. WAITITI: Grown-ups? MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: Is this for grown-ups? I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge. I just felt so guilty, I've been carrying him around all day. WAITITI: What? MATUA: Look at it. Daddy. - What? What? - WAITITI: What? MATUA: What? WAITITI: What? MATUA: Look. WAITITI: The end! Directed by your dad. Produced by a G, an OG, and that guy. MATUA: The end. WAITITI: The end. MATUA: Bye, guys. WAITITI: Executive Producer Victoria Alonso! Love her! Brad Winderbaum. My best buddy. Look at all these cool pictures. - MATUA: No. - (WAITITI LAUGHS) It's pretty scary. WAITITI: It's not scary. MATUA: Yes. WAITITI: Nice spaceships. Now, you are two. I do forget that, don't I? MATUA: Look at that kitty-cat. WAITITI: Kitty-cat? MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: (LAUGHS) What? Do you think you'll buy the DVD for this? Will you buy this with all the special features? MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: Yeah. Do you think everyone else should? MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: Yeah. Do you wanna get out of here? MATUA: Yeah. WAITITI: Yeah. Okay, there you have it, folks. We're gonna leave. Thanks for watching this film and listening to this ridiculous director's commentary. I don't think you would've learnt anything. It was just me talking really, wasn't it? MATUA: Scary, Dad. WAITITI: That's Jeff Goldblum. He is scary. Yeah, thank you. MATUA: Scary dragon. (WAITITI CHUCKLES) MATUA: Look at how scary... WAITITI: Do you wanna say goodbye to everyone? Say goodbye here. Right here. Into this, okay? MATUA: I know this one. WAITITI: I made this one. MATUA: Oh, boy! And again. WAITITI: I know. It feels like it's "And again," doesn't it? Oh, look, spaceship. MATUA: I wanna see a spaceship. Another one. WAITITI: Yeah. MATUA: I'll be careful. WAITITI: Okay. MATUA: I wanna go see it. WAITITI: Look. This is a tag scene, so this a little tag-a-Rooney. MATUA: I wanna go see what's to eat. WAITITI: Oh, you want food now? MATUA: I wanna go food to eat. WAITITI: Yeah, okay, let's go eat. - Okay, say goodbye! - MATUA: No. WAITITI: Say bye. MATUA: No. WAITITI: Bye-bye. MATUA: Bye-bye, guys. WAITITI: Bye-bye, guys. MATUA: No. No. No. I wanna go bye again. WAITITI: Bye-bye. MATUA: Bye-bye, guys. I wanna go bye again. (GROANING) Oh, boy. (SCRAPPERS EXCLAIMING) (GROANS) on. I just... I gotta say, I'm proud of you all. This revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us! Pat on the back. Pat on the back. Come on. No? Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it. Can't have a revolution without somebody to overthrow. So, you're welcome. And, uh, it's a tie. English - SDH Source: Blu-Ray Translation: Original Commentary with Director Taika Waititi Editing: MBB
