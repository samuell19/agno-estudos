Before the beginning or before the universe existed before the sun slapped its shadows on earth before the universe was created before anything that had primacy there was ALLAH nothing with ALLAH nothing existed before ALLAH So, Where will you hide the sun? The All Merciful, The Most Merciful, The King, The Sovereign The Most Holy, Peace and Blessing ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH The All Merciful, The Most Merciful, The King, The Sovereign The Most Holy, Peace and Blessing ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH *The All Merciful, The Most Merciful, The King, The Sovereign The Most Holy, Peace and Blessing ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH ALLAH Those meetings between Muslims and Christians started in Paris then Rome, Geneva and Strasbourg, The idea always was that religion is an important issue for the human race Eric Rono reporter for Le Monde newspaper from France has this conference reached a specific program that enforces specific religious measures on the government to re-enforce the power of religion in Muslims countries? We do not seek power by using religion as an excuse, the conference's main goal is to discuss methods to convince atheists that are increasing in numbers daily, that them abandoning the spiritual and religion values is what made the people of this generation completely lost! tell me, how will you reach them? We will reach-out for them where ever they were, in the streets, in clubs and wherever they gather Even in dance clubs? Yes, why not? Doesn't this contradict with the respectful status of the Clergyman? No of course not, the Clergyman is not from a different planet Do you go to the movie theater? Yes, of course What do you think of the new stream of sexually themed movies nowadays? It's Intellectual and moral bankruptcy! You said in the conference that there are some parties discretely fighting religion, can you tell us who they are? If you read "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" You will know who those are! You mean Israel? Israel and World Zionist Organization of course. What do you think about what happened in Lebanon? This question is for Father Simon What happened in Lebanon confirms what my colleague Sheikh Mahmood said that the World Zionist Organization planes sedition to create tensions between Islam and Christianity. How? They want to prove to the whole world and the nations of the world that its impossible for Arabs and Jews to live in one country and no matter how long it takes, the clash will be a matter of time, and that's exactly what happened in Lebanon. And from other side, Israel and World Zionist Organization wanted to plan conspiracies between Muslims, Christians and Palestinians to kill each other on Israel's behalf. Do you agree with this Sir? I agree with each and every word my colleague Father Simon just said Peace be upon you Peace be upon you Are you?.. I am Arabian my dear Sheikh welcome, welcome. I thought you were.. Foreigner? No, No I am Arabian -If you are in Rome, Do as Romans do- Please allow me to tell you how much I admired your knowledge and your eloquence Oh my, thank you No, I am glad that we started to be more loud regarding our issues and that we deal with them with dialogue I will not leave you, I would like to help, I am an expert in Europe My help will cost both me and you nothing, but you will benefit greatly from it Marilyn! Marilyn, an Italian author and a reporter, a colleague of mine She is highly interested in the Arab region She has many publications about the Arab World. Welcome Hello Sheikh Mahmood, we met in the conference, he has with a very special ideology that you will like It will be my pleasure to listen to your ideas I will go bring the car, lets meet by the main entrance Sure Yes, and a professor in the Faculty of Islamic law Do you think those meetings between Christians and Muslims, and this dialogue is a good idea to solve world's problems? Sure, of course. Its obvious that a high percentage of people now lost their trust in everything, in the society and in themselves. Even lost their belief in their religion all religions shall cooperate to face this tremendous physiological damage that the world might sink in And I think that the huge state of decay spreading all over the world now are targeted waves that targets the moral values of people and push them toward a new set of corrupt values and push those people toward a civilization with consumption habits The world is truly not paying attention to those facts Because Peace be upon you Peace be upon you Because the media is in control with all its twisted methods Look at the Palestinians for example Israel stole their land since half a century and only now the world started to acknowledge those facts and recognized them And you think you can defeat Israel and reclaim your land? Palestine is part of our Islamic culture and it was stolen from us, and this won't last forever Well, the image of the Arab world now is clear and honorable Marilyn! Come over! OK! Who is it? Ringo, my colleague, a reporter for the newspaper, I will give you a ride so we can continue our discussion. Thank you, I will will take a walk OK, but we will cruise back in the car.

We were up there with God And then God brought us here And he left us and left? No, he is with us Where is he? He is everywhere, he gave us everything Everything? Of course! And what do we give him?

Yes I do Your brother Bob knows that you pray? No he doesn't! No! this way the curse of Sheikh Mahmood will haunt us all! What now? I have to keep my religion beliefs a secret! Religion? Quran! Imagine, the Quran is available in all homes, all bookshelves and you can find it everywhere but unfortunately, many people do not try to read it Have you read Jean-Paul Sartre's books about Existentialism? I read nearly all of them Oh if you read the Quran Its a miracle, the eloquence the physiological and social meanings I am asking you what do you think of Existentialism? not the Quran! If Jean-Paul Sartre studied the meaning of freedom in Islam he would've changed his calls for Existentialism, I oppose all theories that are being used against all religious beliefs under the cover of the progressive movement. We are talking to you about religion, why you care? Now I know that you are backward and reactionary What a shame! we think less of our religion and issues and follow the imported and destructive ideologies You will buy for us today I don't know how I never bought Morphine before You should know all this Am I right? Yes, you are right! There you go How may I help you? Can I... Can I have some of that? Biscuits? Yes Sure Thank you Whats this? You let us down! shame on you! Its not a shameful that he does not know how to buy drugs but shame on him if he was high all the time! like you guys not knowing how the world functions. You too Sami are on drugs! a different type of drugs! What do you mean? Politics, its the ultimate drug! I predict for Sami to be a diplomatic leader We want to let Sami forget everything even himself! Yeah! Hold tight Increase your speed Hold the gas grip Hurry up! Joe needs more training and he will be fine Am I right? Yes, you are right! May I have 2 minutes of your time? Come in What are you reading? A history book Is it true that you graduated from Sorbonne University? Yes So, you lived in Paris? 4 years And you lived like this? What do you mean 'like this'? I mean you did not have girlfriends? I had fellow female students in the university of course You went to college? Yes, but I did not graduate What were you studying? Chemistry Why didn't you finish? Its a very long story. You want to sleep now? No, I will finish reading the book. Whats the time? 2:30 I wasted much of your time? It's OK. Tonight is a weird night, I am so bored I could not sleep at all, You know, when I first saw you I didn't like you at all But afterward, I started to like you Good evening Hello Mr. Mahmood Hello I was wondering, may I spend the night here tonight? Of course, its an honor to host you in my room tonight Thank you Mr. Shareef Go ahead Go ahead Ibraham passed the river believing and Moses passed the sea with help and Jesus passed the grave a Sultan and our prophet Mohammad peace be upon him went in Al Isra' trip from Mecca to Jerusalem. God knows what we do not know and he can do what we can't do why we try to deny all his blessings? I think that all the prayers of our fathers and ancesesters is enough for all of us to go to heaven -question in french- No, it has its reasons and not random like this The Quran opened the doors of equal-ism between men and women -question in french- The European woman only claimed her rights in the Industrial Revolution era and she claimed those rights from democracy not from religion. since science could prove and discover that our actions, dialogues and ideas exist although our materialistic bodies, how you think that God won't hold us accountable for our actions in life? Religion and natural sciences are in war together against doubt and ingratitude the only scream in this fight was and will always be "God Exists, God Exists" Don't be afraid Your hands, Your Hands! Hold tight! Bravo, he is getting better at this! Wait 2-3 more weeks, and he will be able to beat you! Joe, Joe! Joe! Could your God save my brother? May God relieve him, and you and relieve all of us Yousef is a good man, God will save him We are sorry for your loss! Yousef! Yousef! Yousef! Yousef! Yousef! Yousef! Life is cruel to everyone! Even the little boy that is on his own Life, where are you taking us? We know were we are heading Never anyone could live twice! Life, where are you taking us? We know were we are heading Never anyone could live twice! No friend could survive you! No lover could survive you! And we are all on this path! Stranger lives a stranger! No friend could survive you! No lover could survive you! And we are all on this path! Stranger lives a stranger! Why we lived to start with? And why we leave? Why we lived to start with? And why we leave? A question with no one to answer! A question with no one to answer! Can someone tell me? what does all this mean? Show me anyone that can live as long as he wants? Or even give his soul to another person? And they call it life! That's not Yousef in the grave That's Yousef's body The human being is not just a body The body is just a cover for the soul Science has proven that the human cells always renews itself, right? And life in its beginning is the beginning of the end. Hakim, how is Bob doing? We found him! Sheikh Mahmood And Ringo are with him in the cemetery Don't be mad at me Yousef Its the first time you see your brother cry I taught you to never cry! Nothing in this life is worthy to make us cry! But you,.. You are my whole life Yousef! Ibrahim, death is everyone's ultimate fate Only Allah is The Ever Enduring and Immutable You shall believe in God and accept all this What do you want from me? What do you want from me? I told you 100 times, there is no God! You want me to believe you even after my brother died? Leave me alone, you and your God! I seek refuge in Allah from the cursed Satan In the name of God, Most Gracious Most Merciful O Allah, forgive him, he does not know Guide him toward the right path Please Ringo, keep this man away! Bob, Sheikh Mahmood was very concerned when we all woke in the morning and did not find you in the camp! He insisted to find you and not leave you by yourself What do you want from me? Why you keep following us? Because you need me! Leave us alone, leave us alone! As a Clergyman I should be available when people needs me! We are not people! What do you want from us What do you want from us I want to enlighten your path! Out path is different that yours! Out path is different that yours! Out path is different that yours! Out path is different that yours! The beautiful life, the music All gone! Now our whole life is hell ! hell ! Ringo, she doesn't love me anymore Easy on yourself Bob My brother Joe left me I need him and he died! he died! Believe me all Believe me all Sheikh Mahmood is a magician! Believe me all *Sheikh Mahmood's voice* None has the right to be worshipped except Allah; He is One and has No partner. All the kingdom is for Him and all the praises are for Him and He is Omnipotent O Allah, place light in my sight light in my hearing, light in my heart O Allah, I seek Your Protection from torment of the grave Mustafa, I forgot to tell you I found Bob! We are going to see him You want to come along? No, you go! OK, you just keep reading your buddy Sartre's books Good morning Bob, Where am I? What brought me here? What do you want from me? I'm here to say goodbye before I leave And I ask you to take care of Sophia I wish if you visit me My address is with Ringo Bob, why are you doing this to yourself? You are braver that this! Bravery? We are the generation of fear, we are forever lost! We are the victims of hunger, victims of war and lies! Its not us that crucified prophets! Its not us that destroyed mosques! Its not us that destroyed churches! It's not us! Leave us alone! Leave us alone! Calm down Bob You were very tired yesterday night So, we brought you here to get some rest I am leaving for 2 days and you can stay here in my home I don't want to stay at home! We don't want homes homes are jails You live in a home and does not even know your neighbor's name! But in the camp, we all live by love! We know each other's problems and habits We cooperate on doing everything, We live in love and peace. If that's the case, then we agree on that Ibrahim! And then, alcohol, drugs and porn Is not needed in the lifestyle which you are describing! Right? Ringo, I am ... Alcohol, makes you drunk and unaware! and a person without brain is an animal Drugs, lets its addict lose sense of time and responsibly! Ibrahim, I want you to think about all what happened I am sure you will see your path clearly Sophia, Sophia do not be so stubborn why you torture yourself like this? let me see if Mohammad has a shot It's OK Mom he will bring you the shot now You must know that Virgin Mary is the most pure woman in Islam The Quran says about Virgin Mary ((the angels told Mary "God had chosen you, purified you and given you distinction over all women.)) The way I see it, there are counter-parties that deliberately creates those conflicts and clashes between Islam and Christianity in those conferences I agree Yes, that's clear and well known now Sheikh Mahmood, Mom Sophia is not feeling well and she is refusing to take the shot I will go see her May I come in? Munir said that you are tired Is it the same attack again? Since you made up your mind, You can do it! you must know that God is with you. Sophia, I brought the shot. What is this shot? Morphine of course! So she can rest from all this misery. If she wants to take it, give it to her! No, No Take it Mom No Take it now and you can quit later No I won't either she quits now or she will never will! I will not take it, Take it Mom No sweety I will not I won't I won't I won't In the name of God, Most Gracious Most Merciful Sophia! Sophia! Where is Sophia? Sophia! Sophia! Sophia, You leave Bob and sit with this! Bob is not finished yet, I am not finished yet Get away What's this Ibrahim? This is very inappropriate! You think you're smart? You are.. You are nothing! Ibrahim You are nothing! You are nothing! Nothing Nothing Poor Ibrahim Go with him Sophia He needs you now more than ever *Sheikh Ibrahim's voice* How can we not believe in the Quran verse that says (You have been given very little knowledge) God Almighty has spoken the truth. We shall have strong belief in Allah. I am most stunned by who look at the sky and witness the greatness of creation and doesn't believe in Allah This is Kaaba, Sheikh Mahmood told me a lot about it Shh, you still a boy Don't speak about these things And kids are not supposed to go to Pilgrimage No, many kids are there, but you can't see them because they're tiny I am leaving with Uncle Mahmood to God's home And Sophia said you can you? Yes, imagine, she does not get upset anymore when she sees me praying Yesterday she asked me how much I love uncle Mahmood? I told her I like him this much! boy! Sheikh Mahmood again? Forget Sheikh Mahmood Tell me, what you got for us? Some new cassettes Ob yes, now you are talking! John Travolta is much better than Sheikh Mahmood I will send you 2 letters when I first get there. No, 3 letters Munir, You will not forget me right? Haven't you said that you will follow us? Yes, I forgot! When I first see God at his home I will ask him to cure you I am better now You are fully cured? Yes, completely Then, I will ask him that you never get sick again. I know you are mad at me because I was away for couple of days forgive me Are you crying? Forgive me You misunderstood the whole thing Are you leaving? Yes! What about me? We are on different paths now. Never before we were on the same path as we are today, I lost everything and I will not lose you too. Listen Bob, I was lost before But thank God, now I found myself and found my path. He cursed you! he cursed you! Sophia, you are mine, mine! No one can take you from me No one can take you from me No one can take you from me Sophia! I did not see her! Even you Hakeem? Where did you hid her? I am telling you I did not see her The one you saw with me was not Sophia. I know how to find her Mr. Mahmood, Sheikh Mahmood how are you? I am fine, and yourself? Fine What are you doing here? Waiting for a couple of friends Imagine, Sophia is here with us Sophia? How did she make this decision? Now she is here, please come in I expected such decision from Sophia She made the right decision You will feel that she is a complete different woman I wanted to check on her before I leave. Sophia will return to Beirut, she gave up her old lifestyle The important thing is that she escaped from the claws of the atheistic wave and now she believes in God that's all because of you me? If that was the case then I would've called her to Islam and took her from you, if God wanted good for someone he would let that person be his own preach Please, this way Luka, Luka, Luka, Luka, Luka Why you are not answering me You are all here and I am all by myself I am all by myself Bob, when someone gets tired he shall rest Relax Bob, get some rest with us Come here, come relax with us Sophia is with the Sheikh now and you want me to relax and just be still and silent like all of you We are not silent Bob We are moving from the inside You are crazy and weak you run away, that's all what you do I will kill him! I will kill her and him! You just stay still like this I will kill him! I will kill him! Allah is the Greatest Allah is the Greatest Allah is the Greatest There is no god but Allah There is a big difference between believing and surrendering to fate for example Islam calls its believers to enjoy life in a moderate fashion and calls them at the same time to fight exploitation and fight injustice to achieve social justice, religion is a huge progressive power and all religions speaks to the human well, and I am ready to respond to any scientific theory and my answers will be from the Quran, knowing that the Revelation of Quran was long before the modern science Whats is it with you son? You have been here a couple of days and you have not spoken to anyone you did not even pray, and we did not see you in altawaf "circling the Kaaba" aren't you here for Hajj? you are here to meet God. I am here to meet Sheikh Mahmood you have no idea how important that is for me. I wish you will meet him, but you are here asking forgiveness from God and there is no barrier between you and God I am here for him O Allah, we are all here for God come on Haj and lets all worship god and circle the Kaaba, come on, Me? Yes, lets go Haj Here I am at Thy service O Lord here I am. Here I am at Thy service and Thou hast no partners. Thine alone is All Praise and All Bounty, and Thine alone is The Sovereignty Thou hast no partners O Allah, by your leave we have reached the morning and by Your leave we have reached the evening, and by Your leave we live and by Your leave we die and unto You is our resurrection Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire! My son, how will you find Sheikh Mahmood among all those believers? we are all Sheikh Mahmood, we are all alike Yes you are right you are all alike! Here I am at Thy service O Lord here I am, Here I am at Thy service and Thou hast no partners Thine alone is All Praise and All Bounty and Thine alone is The Sovereignty Thou hast no partners None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, Alone, He was true to His promise, and He helped His servant, and He gave might to His soldiers and defeated the Confederates alone None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, Alone, He was true to His promise, and He helped His servant, and He gave might to His soldiers and defeated the Confederates alone Modern science claims that life with all creatures developed on its own in accordance to the controversial laws in it, first comes the plants and then the human race the controversial substance claims this. if we accepted that to be true we shall ask, who created the substance? and if this question was not asked, that's ignoring the scientific logic! substance in all its raw shapes that we see around us, is very accurate and well sealed and there is no way for it to simply exist on its own, without a creator! Just like Sheikh Mahmood! Tell me son, what did Sheikh Mahmood do in the hippies camp? Nothing, he just said things like the things you were just saying now That's clear That's why you followed him here? I came to... to what? to... I don't know, I don't know *symbolic ritual to stone Satan* God is the Greatest God is the Greatest God is the Greatest Our Prophet peace be upon him gave up everything, the huge properties the huge wealth and the countless amount of money and he did not keep anything for himself, he did not embrace life's temptations, peace be upon him, he left us two eternal and inspirational miracles In the name of God, Most Gracious Most Merciful *Reading verses of Quran* Hast thou not seen that Allah He it is Whom all who are in the heavens and the earth praise and the birds in their flight? Of each He knoweth verily the worship and the praise; and Allah is Aware of what they do What happened? I ended my relationship with someone and thank God I am so relieved now Tell me son, what is your name? You have not told me what is your name yet. My name.. My name is Ibrahim Haj Ibrahim? Haj Ibrahim! can someone like me go to Pilgrimage and become Haj? That's weird, what have you been doing all the time while in here? Oh yes, you are right, you are right Haj Ibrahim And we will visit Al-Madinah together with God's blessing God willing God willing O Lord O Lord O Lord Allah is the Greatest Allah is the Greatest Allah is the Greatest There is no God but Allah no longer in my being except you forgive me You know I am here for you I will not seek satisfaction from anyone but you Glory be to you my Lord forgive me no longer in my being except you Have mercy for me You know I am here for you I will not seek satisfaction from anyone but you Allah is the Greatest Allah is the Greatest Allah is the Greatest There is no God but Allah Where will you Hide The Sun?
