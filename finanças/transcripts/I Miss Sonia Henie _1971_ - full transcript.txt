She's gone. Is that why we're here? I don't know. She's been gone for a long time. The time I spent getting ready for her to wake up. Sometimes I wasrt ready till the afternoon. She would ring, I would put my cap on. She always slept with her hat on. Let me show you. Lie down. She wanted me to tuck her in. She always wore such a hat. Every day when she rang, I went up to her room. I used to pass my fingers over her up and down. I've never understood why she would't let me into her room. What is it?
