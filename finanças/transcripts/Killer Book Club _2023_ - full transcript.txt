Alicia! Honey, please. Please don't. DON QUIXOTE No! No! Please! Please don't! THE GIRL FROM CARRIÓN GACY: SHE WILL BE THE ONE TO DIE 6 YEARS LATER VIRGINIA: CHECK THIS OUT!! Are you blind? KILLER CLOWNS Hi. Pretty romantic stuff in this book you wanted me to read. Mm-hmm. Will it help if I sleep with you tonight so you won't be afraid? Yeah. You think you can disappear for four days without even a WhatsApp? Sarita, we might have to stop fuckin', y'know? You're actin' like my girlfriend. Hey! Let me introduce my friends from the book club. Come on. Come on. Say hi to my followers. I'm up to 11,500. Oh my God. I'm begging you guys. Can someone please sleep with him? - Where's the romance section? - Under bad taste. Over there. RECYCLE YOUR SHIT KILLER CLOWNS KILLER BOOK CLUB - What's up? - Hey. Good to see you. Hey. Do you guys like the shithole the school gave us for the club meetings? And look. We're right next to the boiler in case we want to set ourselves on fire. Shall we begin the seventh meeting of our book club? Killer Clowns by Miranda Duncan? Who chose this garbage? Rai, why are you even here? It's not like you read the books. Who wants to start? How about our new member? It's nice that you come though you don't go to this university. All right. Well, I'm gonna go. She's a good writer, and it's well crafted. And the killer clowns are creepy as fuck, but it just felt a bit contrived. - Just a series of shocks. - Don't you like to be shocked? I mean, you published a horror novel, didn't you? Yes, but I was really just a kid. Yeah, but let's... get back to talking about this book. Besides just being scary, it should also teach you something. Yeah, well, I think it does. The whole thing's about coulrophobia. What is that? An irrational fear of clowns. Can cause you to have a panic attack if you randomly see one somewhere. Hey, did you guys see that video with the killer clowns? I put it on the group page. - Now, that was scary. - No, no. Check out the killer clowns page on Insta. That'll scare you to death. They've got costumes and balloons but look like psychopaths. Yeah, they stole it from John Wayne Gacy, a killer who dressed like a party clown. Murdered little kids and then buried them in his backyard. Why are you so obsessed with such nasty stuff? It's a little bit too gruesome for me. I've got my killer clown costume for the Halloween party. I can put it on if you want. Uh, no. Run into one of these guys, and I bet you'd be scared. More scared than from a book. In my opinion, books can be absolutely terrifying. Just requires a bit of imagination. So you think I don't have an imagination because I'm a waiter? - I didn't say that, Nando. - That's what you meant, Sebas. Nando, that's not what he said. Okay. Gimme a sec. I didn't say that. Why are you defending that pretentious asshole? The guy doesn't even want me here. Why are you saying that, Nando? Sebas is happy that you're with us. Right. Sure. Because you asked him, Ángela. I asked you to come to book club because I want to spend time with you. - That's it. - Can't you see he has a thing for you? Are you trying to tell me who to be friends with? Because if that's what you're doing, you'd better watch what you say next. It's great that the best teacher here wants to read your stuff. Yeah, except for the fact that I didn't write a word yet. Sebas, I'm freaking out. It's been six years of writer's block. You're still a writer. Just be patient. You can do it. You know, I barely considered myself a writer to begin with. Nando says I have writer's block because I don't believe in myself. Hey, I'm sorry things got so awkward back there at the meeting. Don't worry about it. I forgot to tell you. The Girl from Carrión is almost completely sold out. The main character is amazing, and her mother's terrifying. And you wrote that. I don't know. It was such a long time ago. Kinda doesn't feel like it belongs to me. Hey, do you wanna get together and write sometime? I could come up right now. I... I'd love to, but Nando's coming over after closing the bar. Oh. Oh yeah. Uh, that's cool. I've got to wake up pretty early tomorrow to open the bookstore. So, yeah. Anyway... you should try not to worry. I know you'll come up with something. - I hope so. - Come here. - Night. - See ya. DEAR PROFESSOR CRUZADO, I'M ATTACHING MY DRAFT. IT'S JUST THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS. KILLER CLOWNS DELETE DO I HAVE COULROPHOBIA? WHAT CAUSES COULROPHOBIA? WHAT IS COULROPHOBIA? LEARN THE SYMPTOMS TAKE THE TEST! Witches, demons, ghosts, monsters... ...and other representations of the occult aren't very effective in classic literature. That kind of stuff doesn't really interest me. It always struck me as a lesser genre. Horror literature lacks a kind of substance, which is its downfall. What? Could it be because the stories often seem a little too contrived? Exactly. There's a lot of gimmickry and clichés. Doors banging shut, haunted houses. That stuff only works to a point, and then it falls apart. Do you agree? Now, another thing I see is people regurgitating other writers' works. I mean, I've got a stack of pages from my students, and I won't name anyone, but all they do is plagiarize the works of their favorite authors. It's not plagiarism. It's fan fiction. You take a story that already exists, and you rewrite it. Then you put it up online and get your followers to read it. - It's awesome. - The definition of plagiarism. What are you all doing here? Huh? I assume you all want to be writers. The key is to live your story. Don't steal other people's stories. Live your own life. Then you'll write the truth. Fuckin' right. Mine are all gonna be like porn. Yeah, if you like short stories. Ángela. I, um... I got your email. You did? Um, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to send it. Actually, I thought I hadn't. Yeah. Well, we can still talk about it in my office, if you like. Thank you. You're still here? My intern is here more than I am. I just need your signature on this donation form. - The medical school is waiting... - Right. The donation. Do I look old to you? Don't answer that. They want me to donate my body to science. I guess they're running out of corpses. - Sit down. Make yourself at home. - Okay. - There you go. - Thanks. - See you tomorrow. - Mm. Great. We can, uh, relax a little now, right? Please don't tell me that you're writing a horror novel. No, I'm not. I've never really liked that genre. Wonderful. Don't tell anyone. Mm-hmm. I'm going through a bit of a rough patch right now. Maybe you've already heard some of the gossip going around? - Mm. - It's my wife. We're, uh, getting a divorce. I'm so sorry. Nah. Uh, so, about what I wanted to ask you... Yes. Well, uh... ...I read your email. And, um... I was pretty surprised by it. Um, well, to be honest, I wasn't planning on sending it. - And now I'm a bit embarrassed. - No, no. No need to feel embarrassed. It just wasn't a finished version, and now I think I jumped the gun. I'm really glad that you wrote to me. It's a rough draft, and I'm grateful that you offered to help me, but I... I'm not sure it'll make a good novel. What do you mean? Oh. Well, what I sent. I mean, you read those first few chapters. Uh... No. Mm. Mm. Maybe I didn't see the attachment. Um... Regardless, I'm still very willing to help you. - Hmm? - Mm-hmm. I'm at your service. I think it shows initiative. We can spend some quality time together. Ángela... ...I like you. I like you a lot. Uh, I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I think we understand each other perfectly. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Open the door, please. Ángela, just relax. Look at me. Look at me. Everything's all right, huh? This is what you want, right? Or maybe you like things a little bit rougher? Is that what turns you on? Huh? Huh? Works for me. Please stop. Please stop it! What the fuck? You're fucking nuts. I'm gonna scream if you don't open it. But you're the one who wanted all this. - Open it, please. - Fucking crazy. You're fucking crazy. All right. Get out. Get the fuck out. Hey, listen. Listen to me. Don't breathe a word of this to anyone. You hear me? Look at me. Look at me! One word, and you're finished. Your writing career will go down the fucking drain. Understand? Little bitch. I'll take over. I know you're not ready to talk about it yet. But, uh... I thought this might help you write about it. I don't understand why she won't just report him. Because you're a guy. Otherwise, you'd know that Professor Cruzado is a respectable man, and Ángela is just an ambitious student. - Take care of her. - Mm-hmm. Course. Hey, girl. ...just download the syllabus, where all the evaluation criteria are specified, even though... Sebas, what happened? When Ángela met him at his office yesterday to talk to him, he tried to rape her. - What? - Any questions? Good. - Bro, what happened? - Okay. I've written the exam schedule up here. Coming up soon, the first date to make a note of is the exam on June 8th, which will be in Literature I. The day after that, Literature II. These formal exams will count towards 40% of your... RAI HAS SENT A MESSAGE TO THE CLUB RAI: ANGELA, I HEARD WHAT THAT FUCKFACE CRUZADO DID 2 U SARA: WE'VE GOT UR BACK SEBAS: WE'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT'LL SHOW HIM KOLDO: WE GOTTA TEACH HIM A LESSON RAI: WE'LL PLAY A KILLER CLOWN PRANK ON HIM ÁNGELA: I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA... NANDO: GUYS, LAY OFF HER... SARA: THERE'S NO WAY UR THE FIRST GIRL HE'S DONE THIS TO. LET'S GET HIM!!! ÁNGELA: COUNT ME IN RAI: AWESOME, BUT NO ONE SAY ANYTHING TO THAT BRAT. SHE'LL SNITCH! TO: LUIS CRUZADO A SECOND CHANCE I WANT YOU TO KISS ME AGAIN. Yeah. Let's do this. Koldo, you have to post this. It's gonna be brutal. So they can blame me? No way. We'll make an anonymous account. You're sure that everyone's gone? The only light that's on is the one in Cruzado's office. - Right? - Let's go through the plan. I start in the office. Which means that Sara's gonna be in the hallway with Koldo and Eva. Nando, you'll go for him next, then it's Sebas. And Ángela, you guys will lead him to the cloister, and then... Who's that? The library was empty when I left it. I swear. LIBRARY Ángela, here. You locked me in there. Why are you dressed like that? - We're going to a little costume party. - Jesus, Eva. You had one job. To make sure we were alone in the building. I guess you're wondering why we're all dressed like clowns. Rai, back off. You're freaking her out. - You're not gonna snitch on us? - No, she won't. - Virginia, you won't, right? - Fuckin' shut up! You won't say anything because now you're in it with us. - What are you gonna do? - This. We're gonna do this. It's open. You can come in. What is this? Who are you? Another outraged student, huh? Go on. Get outta here. Fuck off! What are you doing? No! No, no! Wait, stop! Stop! Please! No, no, no! Stop! No! Someone help me! Oh no. Oh no! Oh no! No, no. No, please. Uh, don't! Help me! Hey! Hey! No! No. No! Help! Help! Help! Come on. Come on. Help me! Help! I can't see! No! No! Holy fuck. - Ángela! Ángela! - What did you do? - Why'd you push him? - I didn't push him! - Cruzado fell on his own. Wasn't my fault. - What happened? So much blood. His face was covered with it. - Is he dead? - No! What the fuck did you do? Oh my God. You fucking killed him. - Calm down, dude. - No. No. - No. Hey. This is on all of us. - Wait. I didn't do anything. Nobody is going fucking anywhere, okay? - Nobody's moving! - You guys, we have to call the police. You want us to get arrested for murder? - We have to do something. Now. - I swear Cruzado just fell on his own. - It was an accident. - Don't call anyone. And we're definitely not calling the police. That guy was all alone in the building, right? And no one saw, so it looks like an accident. - Maybe we should go. - He told Ángela his wife left him. - Maybe it'll look like he killed himself. - Exactly. - We should tell someone. - No, Ángela. Ángela, please. We'll all go to jail. This is all totally fucked, but it'll be worse if we tell anyone. What do you mean? Are you out of your minds? Don't fuck this up, Ángela. You got us into this mess. This didn't happen. We won't talk about it again. We have to swear. I swear. I swear. I swear. No shit. I swear. I swear. I swear. I swear. Hey, guys. Did you hear a professor died at the university last night? How sick. I can't believe it. - WHAT HAPPENED ON MY CAMPUS? - NO WAY! IT'S CRUZADO! So far, authorities are not commenting on the cause of death. It's suspected it may have been suicide. ÁNGELA: I THOUGHT YOU'D SUPPORT ME, BUT YOU DIDN'T DON'T CALL ME AGAIN TRAGIC PASSING OF LUIS CRUZADO REY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR FOUND DEAD ON CAMPUS MCSU PROFESSOR DIES IN ACCIDENT STRUGGLES WITH ALCOHOLISM ACCIDENT OR SUICIDE NANDO: I MISS YOU IGNORING ME WON'T CHANGE WHAT WE DID Have you seen the news? They think it was suicide. Listen. We can relax a bit now, okay? Ángela, I'm sorry this is happening, but if we told anyone, they'd have thrown us in jail. Sebas, don't you get it? We're already in jail. I know what I did, and now you're all involved because of me. All right, everybody. Please take your seats. I would do it again. Hurry up, please. For you. Okay. So, today we're talking about literature of the self, also known as autofiction. Works that focus on the combination between the author's actual lived experience and a fictional plotline. THE MADCLOWN IS NOW AN ADMIN OF THE GROUP Characters' names and locations might be changed. The genre of plays with the reader's mind, making them complicit with the action through confusion. "Is what I'm reading fictitious... or the truth?" Okay. So this can be a fascinating experience for a reader because they can analyze the text in a more in-depth way, looking for clues to compare and contrast that reveal the truth of the situation. For example... Psst! Look at your phone. THE MADCLOWN CHAPTER ONE THE DEATH OF THE PROFESSOR "Chapter One. The Death of the Professor." "And that's the story of how the Heroine, the Wild Man, the Emo, the Babe, the Brat, the Influencer, the Librarian, and the Simp ruthlessly murdered the Professor." "That's how they became the Killer Book Club." "They all deserve to die for what they did." "Which is why I'm gonna murder them one by one, one in each chapter of this novel." And then, "To be continued." Where'd they post this bullshit? On Escrileo, one of those online writing sites. Mostly it's just crappy fan fiction written by teenagers. If they know we did it, why wouldn't they call the cops? They're not using our names yet because they don't want to say who we are. - They're gonna mess with our heads first. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Whoever wrote this was also there. It was written by one of us. Hang on a minute. Why would one of us do that? Why would anyone do that? The Heroine, your girlfriend. She didn't wanna swear. And what about you? You also knew about the site. Anyone who wants to be a writer knows about that website. - That means all of us. - Not me. I'm not a writer. - So? You can still be the clown. Hmm? - Please. Stop it, guys. We're all friends here. None of us wants to kill each other. We're not insane. Hey, you love writing, don't you? Hangin' around with your little notebooks. Rai, that's enough. Leave it! "She swallowed a bite of her own guts as blood spilled out..." I think some of these are even worse. Looks like the clown's gone. You really are a prick. You know that? - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Who just found the clown, huh? You're not real. You're not real. What's the matter? Tell her everyone else will be there. Ángela... there's a second chapter now. They posted it on the site. "Chapter Two." "The Death of the Brat." "The youngest of the group, the Brat, couldn't handle the fear anymore." "She was going to run away." "She was gonna run to her mommy so the clown couldn't get her." "She thought she could escape, but she was already as good as dead." Where's Virginia? I don't know. She didn't come back here last night. Thanks. "She walked to the bus stop." "The street was dark and deserted. The perfect spot to rip out her guts." "No one would hear her terrified screams, but she deserved it... because she was a murderer, and so were all of her little friends." "She threw her suitcase down and ran." "The Brat didn't want to die." Sebas, there's nothing here. Over there. "She got into the school through a hole in the fence." How did she get in? Look! "The corridors were long and must have seemed endless as I chased her, brandishing my hammer." This way. No. No. Please, no. Help! No! No! No, no, no! Please stop! Don't! No! "She couldn't move but looked me straight in the eyes." "Terrified, she begged me not to do it, but I took no pity." "They all did it together, and they'll all pay." "I'll write about their deaths in the most terrifying novel of all time." If it was true, then wouldn't there be blood everywhere... and a body? Ángela, what if it's just some nutjob writing a crappy novel? Ángela. TO BE CONTINUED... You guys! We didn't find anything. But... I know how to find out who the clown is. All right. It may very well be that one of us is criminally insane. But what if this so-called killer clown is also a writer who's really good, possibly even nuts, and maybe goes to school with us here and knows who we are? They might be jealous of us, which means it could be anyone. Well, there's no way it's a chick. The psycho's a dude for sure. So you think just 'cause it's horror, the villain can't be a female? Nice. It's a question of strength. - I'm a feminist, you guys. - Mind if I continue, then? - Sure. I'm sorry. - Thanks. Whoever's doing this, whether it's a man or a woman, is clearly very comfortable writing in this style. It's someone who's obsessed with horror. Huh? Long, drawn-out deaths with characters that are archetypal clichés. They got all the details. Everything. They're showing us that they're total nerds about this genre. And if they go to this university, they've probably borrowed horror books. - Right? - Exactly right. Hold on. - Okay. - Look at this. So what do we do? Should we interrogate them one by one? Ask them why they wanna kill us? Guys, the book that inspired them is the killer clown one from our book club. And we all know who suggested it. All right. Don't flip out. The publishers just sent it to me. They're always doing that for my followers. Enough, please. All right. Accusing each other isn't gonna help us catch whoever's responsible. What if it's someone who's not here? Nando's not here. Because he's working at the bar right now. He's at the bar now? Is it open in the morning? Listen, I'm... I'm gonna say it again. We're all friends here. Or thought we were. Even Virginia. We're not murderers. Which is why I think we need to make a list of every horror freak that goes to this university, then stalk them on social media. That way, we'll know which one is the craziest, right? Huh? Or we could wait for them to pick us off one by one... if you want. Hmm? This is such bullshit. And where the hell's Virginia's body? Did the clown eat it? I'll bet you anything Virginia isn't even dead. We're the ones who are taking this shit seriously, when whoever wrote it might be a total nutjob. It is very likely that Virginia's not even dead. Maybe it is just fiction, but that doesn't explain Virginia. It's like she vanished into thin air. We're gonna look for her, right? You're so beautiful, babe. I love when you wear that outfit. STUDIES AT MCSU What happened? Are you bored? That's the thing when you can't read. - How 'bout a quickie? - So you mean the same as always? Well, it looks like they're not worried about being murdered next. Fine. This is a list of students who've taken out the most books in these genres. Psychological terror, thrillers, slashers, poltergeists, vampires, zombies, occult, etcetera. Their names are Koldo Abouk, Virginia Rubio, Sebastián Hoyos, Sara Pons, Eva Yáñez, Rai García, and Ángela Kuntz. So that is... all of us. Our book club. Hmm? And that means that not only are we the biggest freaks in our whole university, but we also have the highest probability of being psycho killers or just plain psychos. So there's that. You guys, I'm gonna go for a coffee. Can I get you one? No cyanide, please. Uh-huh. I couldn't make it. I got slammed at work. You're freaking out for nothing. Virginia wrote it and took off when we figured it out. LOOKING FOR A BOOK? YOU'RE NOT IN THE HORROR SECTION ARE YOU WATCHING ME? YES WHAT AM I DOING NOW? Ángela. Whoa. - Nando! The clown! - It's okay. I got you. - You're all right. It's over. - The clown... I've got... I just found that. Ángela, it's not... - What the fuck? What's wrong? - Get out! What are you doing? It wasn't me! - The fuck's going on? - The Heroine's boyfriend. - The wannabe writer. - Shut up. - Jesus. - Where were you? Ángela, can we please just talk for a second? These guys weren't here either. - Same for Sebas. - I'm not pointing fingers, okay? Ángela, you know I didn't do it. They want you to think it was me. - Can we talk? - It's better if you get lost, man. Thanks. You all right? This doesn't make any sense. Why would Nando do something like that? Look, this might help. It's impossible to figure out if someone's a psycho just based on their social media, right? I've been stalking the one person that we know for sure is a nutjob. THE MADCLOWN CHAPTER 1 The clown writer. And this... is his profile from the fan fiction site where he posted the novel. It looks like he was trying to get someone to read what he wrote. - He shared it. - With me? It's been almost six years since I was on that site. Yeah. I know. That's where you wrote The Girl from Carrión. Does that mean something? It might be Nando. The killer's always the person you least expect. Or it's the opposite, and it turns out to be the most obvious person. The best friend who's in love with the Heroine? - I mean, I did think about that, but... - Hmm. I was thinking a true fan of horror novels. Koldo, a freak and a murderer. It could also be the feminist writer. Or her crazy boyfriend, frat boy. Three gin and tonics! Hurry! Hey, psycho! You deaf? - Where are those drinks at, man? - What, Rai? You're calling me a psycho? I don't give a shit about your writing stuff. And didn't you come up with the clown prank? Hey! Rai! Hey. Don't you fuckin' start with me, all right? Well, that was nice. THE MADCLOWN HAS SENT A MESSAGE "Chapter Three. The Death of the Wild Man." "There's nothing more exciting for me than killing someone who believes himself to be invincible." "That's exactly what the Wild Man considered himself to be." "I talk about him in the past because he's now just a dead body." Take off that mask. Come on. Show me. Yeah? Is this some kind of fucked-up joke? "He could see my grinning face over him as his guts spilt out." "I wanted him to drown in his own blood." "Then I dragged him to the old swimming pool, where the book club burned their secrets." "It's going to make me so happy to keep killing them off one by one." Rai! He left the club totally out of his mind. Now he won't answer my calls. Sara, Rai always takes off and doesn't message you. Do you think we should go to the police? That way, we can warn them there's a lunatic on the loose. It's not some lunatic, Ángela. Rai is right about that. It's someone in our club. Nando was working at the bar last night, right? Oh yeah. He was there. He was arguing with Rai. Sara, the clown said he burned Rai in the pool, right? But Rai is not here, and neither are the guts that were supposed to be spilling out. - There's nothing in here, okay? - So where were you last night, Eva? You're the only one that didn't meet up. Oh my fucking God. So you're telling me you think I'm a suspect now? Hmm. Well, listen, good luck finding your piece of shit boyfriend. Bye. Big kisses, sweetie. Hey. Found somethin'. TO BE CONTINUED... Welcome to the latest vid on my channel, where I give you books to read and a date with me. I wanna recommend a book that you can't find at the library. This one's published online, chapter by chapter. It's about a clown who's a psycho killer, and he's the protagonist. And the best part, you guys? This motherfucker's writing it. And it's set at my university. What's it about? A literature professor is found dead, impaled on the lance of a statue of Don Quixote. Crazy, right? And so the main suspects are a group of lit students. And one by one, the clown gets his revenge on them. And this legend goes through each murder in a separate chapter. I love it. The best part is that it's interactive. The readers get to decide what happens. Basically, they set up an online poll, and you can sign up to vote. This dude's crazy. He just posted about it right here. Boom! It's so cool. I already have some favorite contenders. I really like the Influencer. I wouldn't get rid of that guy. The Emo? Eh, I... I'm not sure I trust him. The Simp is boring as shit. And the Librarian's a bitchy know-it-all. I think I'd go after the Heroine. Not gonna lie. After all, she got them all into this. All right, you guys. That's my video. Remember to like and subscribe, and I'll see you on the next one. Memento vivere! THE HEROINE NEXT! - Alea iacta est. - The fuck's the matter with you? - Piece of shit. He'll go after Ángela. - Nando. I want to make sure he doesn't come after me. What the fuck, bro? Relax. You're acting like I'm the murderer or something. Nando, come on. People are watching. Hey. Calm down, okay? Where's Ángela? She won't answer my calls. She blocked my number. - Sara! - She blocked you for a reason. Nando, you really should go. Please. You'll make things worse. Just tell me where she is. She's hiding. The clown said that she's next. Ángela doesn't trust you right now, and neither do I. Okay. Koldo, man. What's up with him? Ah, it's nothin'. He thinks I hit on his girlfriend. My turn? Well, at least the clown can't find you here. We'll be safe. Sebas, thank you. I think I got some wine in the fridge. I'll go check. Not real. Ángela. Come on. I want to show you somethin'. I told you how I was following all the clown's social media. I, uh... think I found somebody he's following. Alicia. It says "writer" in the description on her profile page but not much else. Six years. Do you know her? She's the protagonist of my novel. The Girl from Carrión. I met Alicia on this site. She told me she thought of me as her best virtual friend. And she told me about being isolated with her mom. Her mother's strange obsession with literature. She would force Alicia to spend hours reading all the books in the house. She'd make her write about them. And if she stopped reading and writing, her mother would beat her. It was something out of a horror story. She dreamt of being a writer too, but I... I was blocked and needed a story, and Alicia's was it. I decided to change the names. I never thought anyone would publish it, but someone did. And it was such a big hit... My dream was coming true, Sebas. I couldn't say no. You understand? Alicia found out before I had time to explain it to her. She told me that she would write something one day that would hurt me far more than I had ever hurt her. What does that mean? Alicia's the murderer? Alicia's dead, Sebas. What? Look. DAUGHTER MURDERS MOTHER MOTHER AND DAUGHTER DIE IN CARRIÓN FIRE Murdered her mother. And after that... ...she apparently died in the fire too, but I'm almost positive that it was suicide, Sebas. - And that's on me. - Hey. Listen. No. That's why I'm called the Heroine. 'Cause I started all this. It couldn't possibly be just that. Okay? If Alicia is dead, then what about the clown? - What about Cruzado? - No idea, Sebas! I don't know. What I know is that my friends are dying and it's my fault. And I have no idea why this is happening. I just want it to end. Don't say that. Okay? I'm sorry. I'm in love with you. Always have been. WANT TO SAVE THE HEROINE? MCSU MEDICAL SCHOOL - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. - No, Sebas... I... can't think right now. I hear you. I just want to be honest. Turn left. Ángela? You have reached your destination. THE MADCLOWN HAS SENT YOU A MESSAGE ENJOY! CHAPTER 4 THE DEATH OF THE EMO Sebas. I'd rather do this on my own. - I'm really sorry if... - I understand. Nando. Look, I'm sorry. I was freaking out. And Sebas, he... No, I'm sorry. Are you all right? The clown posted the chapter about what happened at the medical school. He said that he left you dead on the floor. I... I mean, what happened? How are you here? I just fainted. Would it be better if I was dead? You could rule me out as the clown. No. Uh, no, no. Of course not. - Holy shit. - It's not that. A girl is dead because of me. Someone knows what I did, and that's why they're writing this novel. What are you saying? Hey, just calm down. Let me help you with this. I'll think of something. Get outta here. Get a move on. Go. - Are you Fernando Aguado? - Yes. The one they found unconscious at the school? THE MADCLOWN: HI, CLUB! I'M PUBLISHING MY NOVEL! KOLDO THE BOOKLOVER Evening, bookworms. I've got a new message for you about the killer clown. He's published paperback copies of his novel and will be signing them for you at the horror story book fair. You got it? As an homage to him, the clown wants us all to dress up like killer clowns. I'll put the fair's location and schedule down below in the comments section. And, uh, remember to like and subscribe. And memento vivere. Getting your followers to dress like killer clowns? It's fucking demented. Nando. I'm so glad you're all right. Really. For real? Seriously, guys. Can you just trust each other? Someone want to explain why we're all here? I'm assuming whoever doesn't meet us is the clown because they're signing books, right? But not Rai. At this point, I'm not sure what I prefer. That he's the murderer or dead. - We're still missing Koldo. - Well, it's obviously him. You think Koldo's smart enough? He's an influencer. Are you serious? Listen. I don't know anything about clowns being invited to the book signing. This is outrageous. Can't you see you're offending the author? I guess Koldo's using this as a gimmick to get more followers. Like that murder poll where they ended up killing someone else. THE MADCLOWN IS LIVE STREAMING The clown's livestreaming this. But only for us. - What the fuck, man? - What's with you? Give me my phone. - Uh, sorry, dude. I made a mistake. - Fuckin' piece of shit. Nando. He's gotta be over there. There. Give it. - Hey. What the hell? - Sorry. Hey! Give me my phone! - What's your problem? - No! - That was new, for fuck's sake! - Well, now it's a piece of shit. Those guys? What the hell? I know you're pissed. We'll fix it. - Are you guys insane? - What are you doing? - Hey! That bitch broke my phone! - Hey! Come back! I'll go check it out and let you know. I'll take care of it. I'll get it fixed. Check it out. Nando! Motherfucker. Nando! Sebas! - Ángela, help me! - Sara! No! No! Sara! No! Look behind you! Nando! Sebas! Oh! I didn't do it. I just took it away from the clown. Ángela. Ángela. You feeling better? You fainted. Here. The clown sent this. HEROINE, COME ALONE It's Eva. We have to tell the police now, Ángela. If we tell them, the clown will kill Sebas. I don't want anyone else to die because of me. I've got to do this... alone. - What, are you crazy? You can't do that. - I've gotta stop it. I've gotta do this. No one else is dying. You hear me? But what if you do? - Let go of me. - You're risking everything for that guy? Because I can't help you with that, Ángela. I'm going. Fuck. Son of a bitch. Eva. Hey. Hey. Eva. Eva. I didn't do it. Shh. It's okay. Don't speak. The... The clown is... It's... Sebas. Sebas. Hey. Hey, Ángela. Help me. - Ángela, please. Help me. - Shh, Sebas. - Please. Ángela. - It's okay. Shh, shh. He's here. The clown. He brought me here then went for you. - He's insane. - That's not true. He's obsessed with you. No, no, no. Listen to me. Don't believe him. - Please, Ángela. Trust me. - He's lying. - Listen. You've gotta listen to me. - I love you. And I know you love me. - We love each other, Ángela. - Shut up! That's why you slept with me. Uh, no. Nando... Tell me he's lying, Ángela. - Nando... - Do it. - Kill him. - Nando, don't... Please, Nando. Nando! No. No. No, Nando. Shit. It would have been a much cooler ending if you'd killed him. It's me. I'm the clown. - No. - Yes. No, it can't be you. Of course it could be me. I created all of this for you. But why, Sebas? Really? Seriously? I don't know. It's just, um... it's a bit disappointing when the killer explains everything, y'know? But if you're that basic, I'll try to break it down for you. There are two kinds of writers. Those who like to just, well, go wherever the story takes them, hmm? And those who use a map, planning everything out before. Like me. So that's what I did. I planned it. All of it. Nothin' left to chance. I wrote out all the parts. "...the Heroine, the Wild Man, the Emo, the Babe, the Brat, the Influencer..." And Cruzado's assault. - I got your email. - You did? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to send it. I thought I hadn't. The whole killer clowns thing was also me. Hey, we should do that to Cruzado, huh? I even wrote his death. It was a wonderful chapter, by the way. - Help me! - What happened? So much blood. His face was covered with it. - No! - No! I wrote it all. See, I wanted you to be the heroine of the most terrifying horror story ever written. And she suffers. Oh, man, she really suffers, watching all her little friends get murdered. The clown said he burned Rai in the pool, right? But Rai is not here. Neither are the guts that are supposed to be spilling out of his body. She didn't trust her own boyfriend. Look at him now. Poor guy. You know, there's also something that I thought I'd never write. Know what it was? That you and the killer would fuck. That was my favorite chapter. Look at me. Look at me, bitch! We wrote that chapter together. You're crazy, you know? Yeah. You might be right. I wanted to be a writer too. I was also on that website. The one where you met Alicia. Alicia? I'm almost positive that it was suicide, Sebas. And that's because of what I did. That's why I'm called the Heroine. Alicia. Did you have a virtual romance? ALI: MY BEST FRIEND WROTE A NOVEL ABOUT MY LIFE. I WANT TO DIE Well, she and I did. You took advantage of her. - Yeah. Yeah, you did. - No. GACY: SHE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO DIE You drove my girlfriend out of her damn mind. You made her want to kill herself. And kill her own mother. And that's why, Ángela... I'm writing this novel. Because I have a classic motive, the most classic motive in all of literary history. Revenge. Nando. Nando, I'm sorry. I'll get help. Ángela! Surprise. Virginia? Virginia's just a stupid character that I created. My name is Alicia. And you are my best friend. No... you can't be. Alicia, you're dead. You committed suicide in that fire. No, that never happened. I forgot to tell you that this novel was written by the two of us. Remember when I told you that I would write a novel one day that would hurt you more than you ever hurt me? Are you enjoying it? The ending is so good, you're gonna love it. Just you wait. With all these clowns around, Ángela develops a case of coulrophobia, which eventually makes her go out of her mind and murder every single one of her friends because they made her promise not to talk about what happened to Cruzado. Except for Sebas, her best friend ever. And he writes a novel that becomes a bestseller. And then there's a movie. And then there's a sequel. We're gonna be rich. You'll be rich? I don't think so. You can't take any credit. Alicia, you're dead. He'll get the credit. Are you gonna let him do that? You're the one who wants to be a writer, but he'll get all the money. Shut up. That's enough, Ángela. I know what you're doing here. We're gonna use a pseudonym. Those books always sell. It's the perfect plan. No, it isn't perfect. Because you've both forgotten something. The Emo isn't actually dead. - What do... - Write this! Sebas! Get outta here! Run! Get back here! Ángela! You're not getting away! Ángela! You don't want to be the Heroine anymore? Is that it? Where are you hiding? My novel's almost finished. Ángela, don't you remember? You die at the end. Ángela, we need to finish this. No! No, no, no, no! No, no! No! No, no, no! The fucking end. Stand back. Stand behind the line. I said get back. Stand back. Nando. Nando. Hey. I love you. So much. Can I go with him? Thank you. I'm right here. Sequels. ONE YEAR LATER The continuation of a story, which takes place in the same world but at a later point in time. Same characters, same plotlines. Sequels have become the new normal in contemporary literature. You can't have a bestseller without a sequel. Obviously. The audience is built in. And all they want is just more of the same. I feel like sequels are such a cop-out. "If it worked the first time, we'll regurgitate it." If a novel is successful, is it smart or redundant? Well, a sequel only makes sense if there are loose ends to be tied up. Otherwise, you're dredging something up, and that doesn't usually work. Exactly. The main problem with sequels is that if the... Very nice. That's why everyone thinks you're a nerd. I guess that's just who I am. ...cases of these subsequent novels. Understood? For next class, bring in some examples. Okay. See ya next week. There's a Gothic literature class in room 237. Wanna go? You know you don't actually have to go to everything? Sounds like a classic newbie move. How else am I supposed to rise to your level? Whoa! You should go. I'm gonna get a bit of writing done because my publishers reached out, and they wanna know what I've been up to. - Crimes on Campus? - Mm-hmm. - This time, I have a good feeling. - Of course you do. It's your story. See ya later. - Are you serious? - Yes. I couldn't believe it. That's impossible. KILLER BOOK CLUB
