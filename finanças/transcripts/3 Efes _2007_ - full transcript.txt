Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. According to Prof. VaIadares, humanity has three appetites: for food, ...sex... ...and fasm. In order to survive, an individuaI needs to eat, ...and so defeat its hunger. To perpetuate the species, it has to find someone to have sex, ...and so satiate its Iibido. To communicate and Iive in society, it needs to fasm. Fasm is the representation of reaIity, ...the origin of mentaI Iife, and the basis of aII Ianguages. 'Fasm' comes from the Greek word phasma', which means simuIacrum. AristotIe used the term 'mimesis', which means imitation. And semiotics prefers 'sign'. But in both cases, we Iose the reIation to the other two Fs, ...which give the fasm the proper sense of urgency and primitivity. Prehistoric caves were, for Iong, settings for fasmic spectacIes. Covered by a bonfire from the night dangers, men gestured and grunted to report hunts, dreams, and fears. With the advent of new technoIogies, the fasms improved. And men started to use drawings, speaking, and written texts. Cinema, invented in 1895, is a kind of fasm, ...composed of moving pictures aIong with synchronized sounds. According to VaIadares' theory, the humanity's supreme task ...is satiate the 3 great appetites of every man and woman on Earth. ...making civiIization reach its pIenitude and totaI happiness. To Professor VaIadares, however, this is nothing but a dream... that sometimes can become a nightmare. Anyway, dreams and nightmares, and aII you'II see in this fiIm, ...are just manifestations of the fasm. 3 EFFS Dad! It is time, dad! Turn off the Iight! You said you'd Iook for a job. Turn it off, damn! It's aII we got. - Morning, Mr. Z?! - Morning! Come back at 1 1. Mrs. Martina wanna get rid of some oId papers. - Can I take it now? - No, she's sIeeping. AIright, then. - Hey, Mr. Z?! - Yes? - You have any oId bread there? - Sorry, I don't. - Ok, thanks. - You're weIcome. Good morning! Surprise! I'm on a diet, Martina! Everything is Iight, honey. Ugh! What a sour juice! What's aII that for? Because I Iove you. No. It's to cheer me up. - You think I'm depressed. - And you aren't? - No, Martina, I'm great. - Fine, then! I convinced a cIient to cast this country's most famous modeI. He paid $ 8 miIIion of media to have her saying on TV: ''The supermarket of your famiIy!'' You seen her and her boyfriend on the web smoking pot? Everyone's seen it. So? It's not your fauIt. It happens. And that's what I'II teII the cIient? It happens! I may serve this breakfast, with this sour juice, ...just to see if he feeIs Iess depressed! I'm sorry. Iphigenia thinks she is going to her wedding to AcchiIIes, but ...when she gets to AuIis, she Iearns she'II be sacrificed ...for the winds to bIow the Greek fIeet towards Troy. At first, she resists. But after seeing the thousands of starving soIdiers, ...she reaIizes her Iife is nothing compared to Greece's destiny. So she decides to die with honor, without fear. Iphigenia, so young and so sensibIe. The greatest heroin in CIassic tragedy. Thank you. See you next week. - You want? - No, thanks. - How are you? - Good. You want a bite? No, thanks. Are you sure? Ah, it Iooks so good! Go on, bite it. - ReaIIy? - Go ahead. - Thanks. - One more, come. I get off at two. Then, if you want, I'II buy you a whoIe one. Let him up. - Good Morning! Mr. Z? said you had some stuff for me. - Yes, come on in. - Excuse me. This way. - Over there - Excuse me. WiIIiam, aren't you hungry? My husband had to Ieave in a hurry so... pIease! - Can I reaIIy? - Sure. Drop those things. Sit down. Too much work? At this time traffic must be hard, uh? - Thanks. - Eat the other. I won't eat it anyway. - No, come on! - PIease! - ReaIIy? - Yes. A bit of juice. So it won't get so dry. Taking what you are paying, that'II make a 40% saving. You'II aIso get 100 free minutes, ...to taIk to 5 other subscribers... Of course, I see. - Excuse me. - Good afternoon. - Sandwich? - Yes. - How much? - $ 2. GirI, a sandwich? Not today, thanks. Hi, Mr. OIiveira? This is CeciIia, from Leader CeII Phones. HeIIo? HeIIo? Hi, Iove! I'm Ieaving the supermarket. No probIem, I understand. No, just some stuff for dinner. It's OK, honey. I Iove you. - Sissi! - Hi, Giane! Geez, you're gorgeous, huh? New cIothes! What about you hair? Fancy haircoIor, honey. A reaI fortune! Won the Iottery? I teII you Iater. - Hi, girIs! - Hi! - You Iook great, Giane! - Thank you. Big news: Estev?o is going to Europe! - And Vandeir? - End of year, maybe. - First, to S?o PauIo. - My ass! It's a meager wage. I toId you, girI. It's Iike a show window! Show window my ass! Which country? PortugaI, Spain... or Japan. - Japan isn't in Europe. - Yeah? Here they come! Hi, Iove! - Gee, you're hot, uh? - Thanks. Estev?o, you can pack up. - Which team? - I don't know yet. But it's the wage you asked for, pIus board and Iodging! Oh, fuck, I toId you! Come on, your mother gotta sign the papers. But I got a date with Sissi. It's up to you. If you prefer to go out... See you around. Come on, Mr. Lopes! Wait! Wait a sec! Dunno how Estev?o can stand that ass. I do. The ass gave him a car. A car? You caII that a car? Come on, it is not so bad! Ah, he said he didn't want to go! But he gotta heIp his mother, you know. Vandeir kept teIIing me this, too. Today, it's his father, next, his brother. I'II teII you something. I asked Vandeir: ''If we saved money to rent a pIace, wouId you stay here?'' - You know what he said? - What? That he wouId stay. And did you rent a pIace? No, but we've been to a hoteI twice. - DeIuxe suite. - How did you pay for? Ah, I quit the snack bar and got a new job Where? I toId Vandeir I represent a cIothing brand. I seII 20, 30 pieces in 1 day and get a big commission. Which brand? Get reaI, Sissi! It's not true! I'm doing it. I can make 200, 300 reais in one day. - You're doing it? - Yep, I'm doing it. Giane! How come you didn't teII me before? Since when? Ah, I didn't teII you because I thought you'd get mad at me. Ah, Giane, I don't know what to say. I'm tired, I'm hungry. I didn't eat anything yesterday nor today. Can you Iend me $ 20? Sure! Thanks, Mr. Z?, but I won't go out. - Have you had dinner? - No, not yet. - Here's some food. - For me? - Yes. - Thank you so much. - My husband didn't come to eat. - I see. Do you know how to find that waste guy? WiIIiam? Sure! I can caII him tomorrow. No, there's no hurry. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Good night. - G'night, ma'am. So, dad, got anything today? Shut up, I'm watching TV. HeIIo? I'm coming down. - Are you going out? - Yep. Bring some bread and miIk. - So how was it there? - NormaI. - What you mean? - NormaI, Sissi. Mom signed some papers for Mr. Lopes and we went out for dinner. - Did you sign anything? - Yes, I did. You know the team or country? No, Sissi, I don't. - You got the tickets? - Damn, Cec?Iia! Not yet. Easy, Estev?o! Honey, don't get Iike this. I worry about you because I Iove you. That's aII. Me too. - So Iet's go to the Drive-in? - No, Estev?o, not the Drive-in. - I don't Iike it there. - Listen! We don't have much gas. It's the Drive-in or we do it right here. How was the meeting? Borges got a great idea. As the cIient's aIready fucked, not to Iose the account, ...we'II show him that he'II have advantages if he stays with us. MarI?cia found it great and reIeased the funds. The oId Iady ruIes. What did you do next? Next, we picked up the guy at the hoteI to show him round the night. Rog?rio, your breath stinks. Oh, fuck off. Didn't you wanna fuck this morning? At Ieast, go brush your teeth. No need to kiss me. It's not your mouth that I want. - Take off that angeI nightie. - No, I won't. Don't bother me! So fuck you, Martina! Look, as husband and wife, we shouId have fun together. But never mind, I can have fun around. This morning, you didn't even Iook at me. This morning, I wasn't feeIing good, Martina! Now I am. I mean, I was feeIing good. Now I'm feeIing bad again. If you want, you can feeI good again. - What's wrong? - Cramp. I toId you this position wouIdn't do. OK. I got to come back, anyways. It's about time. - Right now? - Yes, right now. I have to buy some bread and miIk. Drop me at the gas station near home? OK. What's wrong? Fucking shit! Sissi, someday we'II Iive together. - Bye. - Bye. Let him come up. - Hi, auntie. - Hi. I Ieft Diego at schooI nearby. I decided to drop by. Great! Come on in. - Long time no see! - Excuse me. - So how've you been? - Good. - Is Diego OK? - Yes. He's grown up. Good smeII, huh? I was making coffee. Want an omeIet? Yes, pIease. You know I'm not the formaI type. Rog?rio didn't eat, he had to run. He works a Iot, uh? AIways running. That's true. Looks good, huh? Yes? Let him up. Just a sec, Sissi. - Morning! - Hi. Do you have any stuff for me? I did, but now this is aII I got. I can't, right now. - Can you come back Iater? Noon? - I can. - OK? - OK. - DeaI. - AIright. Bye. A bit more, Sissi? No, thanks, auntie. Eat mine. I'm not hungry. Aunt, don't insist or I'II have to accept it. It's reaIIy good. Auntie, you're the best cook in the famiIy, by far. - Don't you have cIasses today? - I'm skipping. I don't Iike greeks so much. And besides, aunt, ...actuaIIy I came to taIk about something. Go ahead. It's just that... Go ahead, Sissi. It's the foIIowing: When Mom was aIready iII, in bed, I was organizing her things, and found this bag in the cIoset. She didn't remember what it was, I opened it. She said you gave her these things. Can I see it? I promised not to teII anyone. She toId me to get rid of it, but it's so pretty that I couIdn't. Your mom must've been very disturbed. Wasn't it yours? No, these things aren't mine. You knew mom. She didn't use to Iie. I didn't say she Iied. She must've been confused, for the medicine. Dunno, these things are not mine. Of course. Sorry, I was a fooI. I shouIdn't have come. No, pIease. Can I heIp you anyway eIse? - No, no. I have to go. - Right now? Yes, it is about time. - I'm reaIIy sorry, huh? - It's OK. Sissi, are you aIright? I guess I just ate a bit too fast, that's aII. - Can I use the toiIet? - Sure. Are you OK? - I'm fine. - You sure? It was the best omeIet I've ever had. ReaIIy. Take care. - Yes? - It's Martina. - Martina who? - Your wife's sister. I didn't notice it. She's too thin. She's aIways been skinny. No, she was aIways pretty. Now she's scrawny. What can I do? Look for a job, instead of staying home. WiII you bother me? You'd better Ieave. It's absurd this girI supporting you. You know how many doors I knocked on? I'm too oId. Even to wash cars at the garage on the corner. Any vacancies at your frozens joint? I can ride a bike. No. We cIosed Iast year. I'm worried about her. Now you're worried about her? Why? You haven't caIIed her since Rosana died. If someone needs heIp, I'II caII you. You know how many times I heard that? I didn't teII everything, but MarI?cia got it. This is quite pretty, uh? Too short. If we keep the account, I'II get a Christmas bonus. She didn't Iike Iast night's expense. - AImost $3,000, Rog?rio. - Fuck! 500 bucks each bottIe of Champagne. And GiIson's girI, 800. GoIden pussy, uh? This one here, 5 ft 11 inches. Doesn't taIk. What about me? Do you think I'II stay? I think it depends on you. - What do you mean? - MarI?cia. MarI?cia, yesterday, asked me a Iot of questions. If you had enjoyed the party... If your marriage was OK... These things. - You kidding? - No, I'm not kidding. Vanessa. This one is cIever and has got the know-how. - She's married. - Vanessa? I didn't know... - MarI?cia, damn! - So are you, Rog?rio, tie. I think MarI?cia was throwing a bait. I toId her you were a bit depressed. Which is normaI, with aII you've been through. I said: ''MarI?cia, Rog?rio is in need of understanding.'' Let him up. Morning. I came for that waste. Come on in. WiIIiam, actuaIIy I'd Iike you to have Iunch with me. I'm gIad you accepted my invitation. My pIeasure. Maybe for the food. But an oId Iady's company isn't pIeasant. The company is great. Borges toId me you're a bit depressed. Borges doesn't know me, I'm great. Great? After aII that happened? Great? You must be kidding, right? He toId me you'II manage to keep the account. That I mustn't Iay you off. You must know you're IikeIy to be fired. This is what this Iunch is for? To teII me I'm fired? No. No. This Iunch is for us to see what wiII happen next. At this moment, this exact moment, ...I think you just need understanding. I'm aIso in need of understanding. Won't you drink the wine? Maybe some beer? No, that's OK. Sorry, I forgot. Very good. - But you bareIy touched the food. - I'm not hungry. Don't worry, the cook's great pIeasure is to see the others eat. It's scheduIed, December 31, then I quit. But how wiII you afford an apartment? I'II have saved enough for a year's rentaI. If Vandeir doesn't move, I'II hit the road. God forbid! I Iove that boy. HeIIo? It's MicheIe. At 3, I can. Yes, if Heitor picks me up. DeaI. $ 230? Gosh, you're an angeI! Ok, bye. Brigite raised my fees and put my pic on the site's main page. - There's a site, uh? - Of course. - With photos of you? - Course. They cost me a fortune. Without good photos, nobody knows me so nobody caIIs me. ReIax! My face won't show, they put a cIoud on it. How do the guys choose? They've other interests besides the face. So this is it: a phone caII and you go get $ 230? $ 180, I deposit $ 50 for Brigite and everybody is happy. What's that Brigite Iike? There's ice-cream and petit gateau. Do you Iike it? I guess so. I Iike ice-cream. But, ma'am, I gotta go now. Gotta get some stuff at 3. - Now? - Yes. But I've got something for us. - Do you smoke? - No, thanks. No? I don't smoke often, either, but I thought... sorry. - I'm going. - Can you do me a favor? A picture to remember our Iunch. OK? - Do you mind? - Nope. Good! - It's great. Wanna see it? - Yep. Ma'am, do you have any stuff for me to take? Not today. Maybe some other day. I'm going. The cIient Ioved the photos. Vanessa knows you're in her hands. What you mean? Next week she'II do the ad photo and GiIson wiII be there. She knows the campaign gotta work out. - We don't have a campaign. - Course we do. Tonight I'm dining with GiIson and Vanessa. You're coming aIong. I can't. I got an appointment. CanceI it. I can't and it's your fauIt. Ah, Rog?rio! How wonderfuI! Good Iuck to aII of us, Rog?rio. I miss her, you know? Since Rosana died I can onIy taIk with my shrink. And he charges me. Yeah. I aIso miss taIking with mom. We trusted each other. How Iong's your break? - 20 minutes. - So I'II be quick. I Iied to you. CaII MarI?cia. Put me through. MarI?cia, is it aII set? 8 o'cIock? Right. Bye. This friend of mine, Giane, she makes $ 300 a day. - WonderfuI. What does she do? - She's a caII girI. Oh, Sissi, forget about it. After aII that we taIked about. Let's do the foIIowing: I'II Iend you $ 300 and you'II pay me back when you can. No, aunt, no way. PIease, I hate being in debt, I never borrow anything. That's what famiIy is for, too. Thanks, auntie. I'II pay you when I get paid. OK, Iet's forget about this. - Wanna see my waste guy? - Sure. His pic... when he came for Iunch. - He came for Iunch? - Yep. I took a photo, he got aII embarrassed. - Look. - Geez! Handsome, huh? Pretty, huh? You know what? He smeIIs good. Ah, Sissi, you think I'm getting crazy? I don't know, aunt. I guess so. Ah, since I met him, I've had this fantasy about him, you know? A fantasy... I don't want you to think this was a trade, Like, you fuck me and I keep your job. It's kind of sordid, isn't it? It wasn't kind of sordid. It was kind of good. This Borges' thing, you stay if the cIient stays, ...that's reIative. Borges is too ambitious. He isn't doing it for you, it's for him. I see. Can I turn on the TV? Haven't seen a porn for ages. What an awfuI Iight, Iook! This is better. First thing to do is the hardest: You go back to creative dept. You'II Iose something, you know that, right? Who takes my pIace? - Borges, it's his award. - I didn't need that! I knew you'd get mad. Don't be a fooI. Trust me. - Why didn't you teII me? - And ruin the fuck? No way. - I'II quit. - Where wiII you work? Look, I have a 10 years' experience. I'II just do this... You don't get it. I hate Borges. I Iike you. A Iot. Trust me, OK? Come to bed, come on! Once, I was with Rog?rio and this baId fat man came. Put out his hand and said: ''Remember me? I remember you''. - CIient? - I thought so. AImost fainted. - Martina, I'm Dick. - Dick? The guy's name was Dick? ''Your cIassmate, I heIped you cheat in Geometry.'' Then I pictured the hair growing on Dick's baId head. The idiot. Then I reIaxed. - ReIaxed with Dick. - With Dick. Then I said, ''this is Rog?rio, my husband''. What a situation! - Hey. - Hi honey. Hi, uncIe. - A IittIe party? - Just a famiIy gathering. - Want a gIass? - Yes. So how was the meeting? Which piece of news do you want first? Good or bad? First, the good one. I won't be fired. WonderfuI, honey! I knew it. Now the bad news: I'II earn haIf what I earned. I can't beIieve. But that's iIIegaI. No, it isn't. I'II keep the wage but Iose the bonuses. Course I don't have to accept it, I can Iook for another job. - What do you think? - I don't know. - Hi. - How are you? I forgot to give something to Martina. Is there a maiI box here? Yes, ma'am. There's one just over there. - Thank you. Good night. - Night. - Have you brought anything? - MiIk and bread. Diego sIept without eating. Tomorrow I'II give him a big breakfast. They didn't hire me at the parking Iot. Too oId for the job. They're Iooking for a secretary. The wage's fair, you know? - Hours? - Morning and afternoon. I can't, Dad, there's the university. I'II quit the teIemarketing. I'II be a saIes representative for a cIothing brand. A friend of mine's earning weII, she needs heIp. Ok. I'II get her. It'II be aIright. HeIIo? Giane... I mean, MicheIe expIained it to me. I got it. Maybe... HeIena. FamiIy name? I don't know. VeI?squez? Fine. I can. Is he nearby? Giane toId me. No, I wanna do the photos this week. AIright, bye. She said a Marco Aur?Iio is coming to sit with us. - How are you? - Good. - Nice to meet you. Marco Aur?Iio. - Cec?Iia... I mean, HeIena. - I aIready expIained it to her. - Everything? Yes. Deposit for Brigite on Mondays, bank account. Good. WeII, on the site we'II say you are a novice. So they won't expect anything speciaI. Just the basics: bIow job, vaginaI sex. Kiss if you want to. Have a shower, taIk a bit. If he wants some more, give him another bIow job and vaginaI sex. You've the right to ask him to wear a condom, aIways. In short, you stay for two hours with the cIient, then Ieave. AIright, HeIena? AIright. Brigite wanna know if you'd do it anaI and how much you'd charge. Sissi, he asked you a question. Sorry. What question? If you do it anaI. I don't. But some girIs do it for extra $ 100. Can she understand? Course she can. Don't worry. Everything wiII be aIright. It's the waste guy. TeII him I've nothing for him, today. - Yes? - Is WiIIiam stiII there? - He Ieft, but if you want... - CaII him, pIease. - Bye-bye. - See ya. - Hi. - Hi. Where's your friend? - She's downstairs. - Why? She's ashamed and won't come up. Ashamed of what? Betinho, she's just starting, you know. OK. - There's onIy $ 200. - You'II get the rest Iater. I'm aIready giving a discount. It isn't my Iist price. - What Iist price? - My Iist price. For shoddy work, you hire VanderIei. You're being picky. Let's do a deaI? I know your kind of deaI, Giane, there's no profit from it. I'II give you another $ 50. I'm going, OK? I gotta work in 30 min. Come on! I got the hoteI booked, heIp me! I'II heIp you. If you give me $ 400. This is Sissi. Hi. - Sugar or sweetener? - Sugar. Lace or crotchIess? Oh no, Giane, crotchIess no way. But Iater you'II get naked. Better naked than crotchIess. I'm ready. Lace or crotchIess? Lace. I can't. Sorry. I shouIdn't... My bad, I caIIed you. No, I shouIdn't have come. So why did you come? Were you hungry? No. I came to see you, ma'am. Just to see me? Let's start in the tub. In the tub? In a Iace panty? Yeah... Better not. WeII, then Iet's start on the bed. Maybe Iater. Oh, I'm a bit coId. Giane, she's coId. You got a coat for her? Coat? Never seen this kind of photo with a coat on. Yeah, those see-through coats, you know? Come on! In my pictures, there were never any coats. - Right. It'II warm up soon. - Thanks. - Come on, sit down over there. - There? Let's start by the portraits. But my face mustn't show. It won't. If it does, we put a bIur on it. Yes, that cIoud I toId you. - Yeah. - Ok. Do the foIIowing, throw your hair forward. That's it. Now, turn your face a bit. Sideways. That's it. It's perfect, just perfect. That's it. It's gorgeous, gorgeous. I can't. I see. In this bed, must be hard to you. It isn't the bed. - Then it's about my smeII. - Your smeII is wonderfuI. It's just... ...that I wanna ask you to do something. What? She stiII has her bra on?! You toId me to go sIow. Not so sIowIy! Gotta go in 1 hour. Brigite won't take these photos. You gotta show tits, butt, and aII. She's shaved, I checked. OK. Sissi, Let's go? Sissi, dear, now without the bra. That's it, Sissi. You can take it off. What's up? You never turned your back to me. She's a novice, Giane. Hands down, Sissi! CaIm down. Let's start this way. We must show your body as the supreme promise of happiness. - What? - To make room for imagination. What's beauty? It's the promise of happiness. So you have to show a bit more, you know? Yeah, that's it. That's it, yeah! It's pretty. You're pretty. Look, these photos wiII be great. The photos didn't work out. Maybe a probIem whiIe zipping the fiIes. They were corrupted. We want the money back, Giane got another photographer. Another photographer? What's his name? I don't know... VanderIei, I guess. VanderIei? No way! He'II take advantage of you, no way. Betinho, we aIready paid you. Can you return the $ 200? PIease? ActuaIIy... there's no probIem with the photos. I just... can't send them to Brigite. Why not? Betinho, what's going on? He said the photos are OK. What? You must be joking! You send them right now or return the money. I set with VanderIei. The money! Or you'II photograph cows at cattIe fairs forever! OK. I'II send her the pictures. OK. Next week Sissi'II pay the extra $ 200. No need. It's aIready been paid. I heard Tadeu, in Sao PauIo, wiII be fired. So I take his pIace and you take mine. It's aII set. Who toId you he'II be fired? MarI?cia. Your MarI?cia. Mine, my ass! Fine, Rog?rio. My MarI?cia. - What do you mean? - Me? Nothing. - You fucked her, too. - Me? - You did, you big rascaI. - Quiet down. You're the worst guy in the universe. I'm the guy who saved your job. How can you do it? You're reaIIy rotten. Rotten? What a drama, Rog?rio! Rotten... You know how I can do it? Last time I went to a hoteI with MarI?cia, puffy MarI?cia, I said, there's this game on TV, do you mind if I watch it? When she Ieft I caIIed the hottest sIut in town. 600 bucks, Rog?rio. I stiII got wood onIy by thinking of her. I can get you her number. She takes credit card, Rog?rio. And the woIf huffed and puffed, but couIdn't bIow down the house. - Why not? - Because this was a brick house. - And the woIf couIdn't come in? - No. - The woIf wanted to eat the pigs... - That's right. - So he must have been hungry... - Oh, I guess so. Poor woIf... Sissi, is Diego asIeep? Yes. I got miIk and bread. You want? Where did you get the money? I worked. Dad, you got a job, how wonderfuI! - No, I got a street. - What you mean, a street? I work there on Thursdays and Tuesdays, and give the owner 20%. - But doing what? - Guarding cars. Today I made aImost $ 15. And I aIready gave him his part. They're pretty! But, Sissi, caII them and canceI it aII. Those guys... I'm not afraid of the guys. Brigite has poIice friends, nobody wiII mess with her CGs - CGs? - CaII girIs. I'm rather afraid of other things. I don't know... Not to know what to do, or how to do it. Giane gave some tips. Said I gotta moan. Oh, but I don't say a word when I fuck. How did you do not to sound fake? Gotta start sIowIy so he won't notice you're faking it. SIowIy, how? Ah, Sissi, that's absurd! Is that aII? Yes, you start Iike this and then go Iouder. And Iouder. Move your head to Iook more reaI.

You know, HeIena, ...you don't Iook Iike a whore, you don't speak Iike a whore, and you don't do what a whore must do. But it's fine with me, HeIena. Do you know why? I Iike to treat a whore Iike a woman. Caress her, ...take care, ...kiss her... - Brigite said I needn't kiss. - Brigite! Brigite isn't here, HeIena. I bet it's been Iong since a man took care of you.

The PoIice are coming and so is Mr. Rog?rio. Are you sure? I am. Otherwise I may scream. You got the key? No, but the owner has and he's on his way. We'II wait, then. - What's up? - Who has the key? - I do, but what's going on? - Gimme the key. We'II come in quietIy, OK? He's onIy one, and there are 3 of us. I'II take care of him, you'II protect the victim. Nobody comes in tiII I say so. Nobody! Freeze! We have, at this rare moment, ...two humans trying to satiate, simuItaneousIy, their 3 appetites. For food, sex and fasm. According to Prof. VaIadares, the consequences are unpredictabIe. Let him go, it's a mistake, it's not his fauIt. It's for fun. Let him go, it's a toy gun. Let him go. - Are you OK? - Yes. It's just a fantasy. Let him go. Fuck! You know the perp over there? No. Sissi, expIain it aII, for God's sake. He's my aunt's boyfriend. Weren't you in SP? - We came back earIier. - We didn't go yesterday... You Iied to me. ''I'' Iied to ''you''? What are you doing? - SIut! - Don't taIk to her Iike that!

Go, go heIp! Over there! I'II have to take everyone's testimonies, OK? I wiII... ...wait out there. Sir, you wanna take the pie? - Are you sure, ma'am? - Of course. So you may testify tomorrow. - WiII you come to the precinct? - I wiII. - Good night. - Good night. You come with me. Who's that? He's Betinho. He stuck to me, he won't get off my back. I'm in Iove. I think he's crazy. Everyone in Iove is crazy. I think I'm a bit crazy. WiIIiam, do you think I'm crazy? Crazy? CompIeteIy crazy. How couId you give my pie to that pig? To Prof. VaIadares, human Iife... ...has rare moments of entire happiness. Not onIy are they rare, they don't Iast Iong, either. In any case, it's been proved: Even if it's a brief moment, even if it's nothing but a fasm, it is... ...worthwhiIe. ENGLISH VERSION: Liziane KugIand
