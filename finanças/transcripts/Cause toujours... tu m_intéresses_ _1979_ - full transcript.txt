I'm bored as shit. My name is François Perrin. I'm a journalist for RTL, I'm a news reporter, and I'm bored as shit. I'm 45. I've been divorced for seven months. I don't know how I get so bored, but I do. They tell me I should go out, see friends, but I'm scared of boring the shit out of them. Since my divorce, I don't really know where I stand anymore. Hello? Does your throat hurt? Take a Pulmoll lozenge for instant relief! Pulmoll lozenges are sold at your nearest pharmacy for 5,90 francs. On a night like tonight, I dialed a number. A random number. I had to talk to someone. Anyone. I didn't think it would come to this. Hello? I was interrupted by my next-door neighbor, Mr. M'Ba. He's a nice guy, but he doesn't lift my spirits. -Good evening, Mr. Perrin. -How are you? Very well. -Did you have a good day? -Yes, very good. I took a walk. And seeing as I'm alone this evening, I thought maybe we could get dinner. Yes… That's kind of you, but I've got dinner plans. Well, that's too bad. -Another time? -I can't on the 26th. My cousin from Senegal is arriving. The 26th is a month away. Yes. I'm free every other night. Very well. Good night, Mr. M'Ba. Good night to you too, Mr. Perrin. Mr. M'Ba's visit put some things into perspective for me. Dialing a random number like that -is something a loser, a psycho would do. I gave it some thought and decided to go out. I decided to start living again. "…summarized by the participation of the people in the state's affairs… which is the prerogative of true democracy." -End quote. -Hello. Hello. The prerogative of true democracy… End quote. In short, the situation is unclear. Unclear. And General Gaudrane, the current president, has stated… Shall we have dinner tonight? What did you type? The current president has stated, "Shall we have dinner tonight?" No… I'm asking you. I mean, I asked you if you want to have dinner tonight. I typed that. That's funny. I typed, the current president stated, "Shall we have dinner tonight!" Shall we? No. -Why not? -Because. General Gaudrane having dinner! Okay, then. So, General Gaudrane has declared, -"We will execute by firing squad…" -"We will… …everyone who has committed treason and anarchy." End quote. So, no dinner, then? That's not it. I just have work. Tonight, I'm working for Julienne. Why not after? One page. I'm late. Well, see you later? I guess. If you like. New story on the gang wars… The passengers of a car were fired at point-blank. Both driver and passenger were killed instantly… RTL. It's 4 p.m. François Perrin with the news. Marseille, a new story on the gang wars. It's 1 p.m. near St. Charles station. Two bikers open fire on the passengers of a car. Both driver and passenger were killed instantly. -At 9 a.m., then. -Very well. -See you later. -See you later. I had decided to go out, to start living again, but it wasn't that simple. I wasn't only low on energy, I was low on money. My ex-wife's alimony checks were draining me. Every month, I gave her a check and hoped that she would find a job. A real job. -Hi. -Hello. -You're well? -Yes. -What's this? -The landlady. What is she doing? -Chinese gymnastics. -Why? That'll do, Mrs. Bonnetaud. Thank you. We're done. Sir. -Thanks, Mrs. Perrin. Tomorrow? -See you. She lets me advertise on the block, so I give her free sessions. Where did you learn Chinese gymnastics? I've read books. Modern dance isn't working anymore. And I know Chinese gymnastics has taken off in the US. I can't give you more. I'm in over my head. You'll get the rest next month. Stay for dinner. I'm expecting Sophie. That's kind of you, but I can't. I have dinner plans. Nicole? Nicole! Hurry up! This dinner will be dull. He's here. Hello. Hello. Want some scotch? Sure. Are you done? Yes. We're done. Well? How did it go? Not bad. It's a nice place. She'll be here soon. Here. So spacious. What a great nook. With all your books and a big work desk. -How's your book coming along? -It's due in September. I'm a little behind. I jumped her when she got dressed. We finished earlier than expected and… we had an hour to kill. I wanted to tell you. We had an hour to kill. I see. Good evening. I'd love a drink. I'm exhausted. These days have been long. If you're tired, we can always have dinner tomorrow, or Wednesday. Well, if you don't mind, I'd prefer that. You don't mind? No. Can you call us a taxi, Georges? I'll come along. I could use the fresh air. That's how it's been since my divorce. I try and they pass me by. When they feel needed, they're gone. Thank you. That evening, my next-door neighbor didn't bother me, and I dialed another number, a random one. Hello? Who? I'm sorry. I can't hear you. What? Hold on. Don't hang up. Don't hang up! -Hello? -Florence? I'm not Florence. You've got the wrong number. Your number's not 225, double 13? No. It's not 225 13 13? No, it's not. Well, forgive me, then. What an idiot. What a pain! Yes? -Florence? -Still not. I've had it! I called a veterinarian twice, an old lady three times, and now you twice. I've been at it for half an hour. I give up. Make a complaint. I don't want to anymore. What? I don't want to anymore. I'm satisfied with you. Please, don't hang up. If I dial 225, double 13, I'll get you again, so… We might as well stay on the line, right? I hope he leaves us alone now. Look no further. I'm Christine. Christine? That's nice. A friend just walked into the bathroom. I'm in the tub fully clothed. I'm sure I surprised her. I have to go. Goodbye. Who was that? A wrong number. You spoke to a random person for ten minutes? His name is Thibault. He's funny. Thibault was funny. And yet, I wasn't feeling humorous at the time. I had my Maurice problem. Maurice worried me. He'd had problems with his wife, she stayed at my place with her baby and I was worried he'd do something stupid. You can't stay there, you'll catch cold. PHARMACY Is someone helping you? -You okay? -Yes, I'm good. Hello. Okay. Did you see him? I don't care. I'm leaving out the back. As you wish. -Bye, Daniel. -Goodbye. -See you later, Christine. -Bye. You and Maurice are ridiculous. Do you want an ugly baby that cries all the time? What a nightmare! Do you want me to take him? The baby. For a couple days. You seem exhausted. I couldn't do that to you. Thanks, Daniel. Don't bother waiting. She left out the back. And if you went to the back, she'd leave out the front. This isn't the way, Maurice. Go home. Be patient. It'll work itself out. Good evening, Mr. Perrin. Good evening, Mr. M'Ba. I made some Senegalese food. Do you want some? No, thanks. I'm busy tonight. Oh, well… that's too bad. So long. Hello? Hello, Christine? She's not here tonight. She's on call. Who's asking? It's okay, I'll call back. Goodbye. He calls me Snowball. Still, I'm the insulted one. He slaps my face, too. He calls me Snowball and slaps me. So, I go to the police. Do you know what the police officer told me? He said, "What do you want, Snowball?" I feel like I'm boring you. Mr. Perrin? Mr. Perrin! Yes? Mr. M'Ba, what's up? I'm sorry. I'm just a little tired. Well… I'm glad you came over. You're at my place, Mr. Perrin. You'll have to forgive me. Don't worry about it! Well, I'll have you over one of these nights. Excellent, with pleasure. -Thanks again. -Sure! Not on the 26th. See you. What's going on? I came to get my wife and son. -And you brought your trailer? -Well, yes. It's cold. Either way, I'm not moving. I won't leave without her. You'll get arrested. Camping in Paris is illegal. And you're on a boat. I can't take it anymore. I'm suffering. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore! What's that? I'm making tea. Want some? No, thanks. I'm going to bed. Christine. Christine! This is for Tristan. It's a rabbit. -Hey. -What? -Guess who's downstairs. -I don't care. He's camping under your window and you don't care. No man has done that for me. Go and talk to him, because you'll never find another like him. -I don't want to see him. -Look at yourselves! You on my couch, him under my window… Then he shouldn't have slept with that bitch! I don't want to see him! Be quiet! He's an asshole! Hello? Don't hang up. Yes? -Hello? -Yes? It's me from yesterday. Is this a bad time? You couldn't have picked a better time. The baby's crying, his mom is too, and the au pair is singing in English. -I'm sorry. Shall I call back later? -What for? -Sorry? -What exactly do you want? Just to talk a little. That's all. -To talk? -Yes. To Talk. All right. What you should do is hang up and call the emergency helpline. Are you still there? Not for long. You don't understand. You think I'm a loser with no one to talk to? That I need a phone to have a conversation? My address book is full of people I'd have an outstanding evening with! I simply liked our chat yesterday and I wanted it to continue. Goodbye! Listen, I'm over 40. Physically, I'm quite ordinary, and I think my bank account is overdrawn. This is what you get… when you go fishing. So, if I were you, I'd reel in my line and cast it again. You're still there? No, I'm not. I hung up. I'm trying to catch one that's prettier, younger and richer. Seeing as you have so many contacts, what do you do for a living? I write. I'm a writer. I don't want a scene. See what he wants. -No! -There are clients. -We need you. Ask what he wants! -No! He wants sleeping pills. This is enough to kill a horse. -I can't sell him that! -We must. He has a prescription. What if I gave him suppositories? No! He has a prescription. Sell him his prescription! Go on. Tell him we're out and kick him out! He'll get them elsewhere. It won't matter. It's for show, blackmail. He's not suicidal, trust me. Thank you. How much do I owe? 40 francs. -Thank you. -Thank you. I'll need your name and address. This is listed as a dangerous drug. Excuse me, ma'am. Maurice Capron, C-A-P-R-O-N. May I have some bandages and iodine, please? Just a moment. Capron, like that lady hiding who doesn't care if I die. And your address? 83, boulevard de Montparnasse. Near the cemetery. Stop fooling around, Maurice. Thank you, folks. Goodbye. What are you doing? Don't mind me. What are you doing, you idiot? -Stick out your tongue! -Hello? Police? -Suicide at Clément Pharmacy. -Put your finger down his throat! Make him throw up! Come here! Stop it! You have to throw up! I hate you! I never want to see you again! Die! Bastard! Die! Piece of shit! -I love you! -I hate you! -Shitbag! Asshole! -Will you stop that? No! Get out of here! Leave! I love you! -Don't touch me, you pig! -That's enough! Leave her alone! Stop it! -Get out of here! -I need you! You enjoying this? Loser! There you have it. I'm probably the only pharmacist to get one month's leave because of a medicine box. But it hit me like a ton of bricks. -There. -It's okay? Very nice. Everything looks normal. The swelling will go down soon. You look exactly the same as before. That's a shame. For a few days, take care with two things: don't catch cold or cry. What? Don't catch cold or cry. For a month, Thibault called me every day. I started to care a little too much. It was worrisome. Hello? Too late, of course. If I tell you something, Christine, will it upset you? You're a fool. I feel fine and I never asked for your advice. I'm sorry, Daniel. For a month, I called Christine every day. We developed a real intimacy. This telephone relationship suited me perfectly. I didn't need to see her, only to talk to her. I told great stories in which I played a starring role. I was incredible. And it felt nice. -Hello, Christine? -Hello? -It's Thibault. Is this a bad time? -Not at all. I was expecting your call. How are you? I'm a little worked up. I just got off the phone with my publisher… -He's absolutely insane. -Why's that? He wants my novel by September! I told him that writing a novel isn't like ordering food. It definitely won't be done by September. -Thanks, Louise. -What? Louise just brought me some food. Tonight, I'm dining in the library. Cold vichyssoise and… a little fresh salmon. I need a light dinner, or else… my writing is worthless. You're going to work tonight? Yes, I'd really like to finish chapter seven tonight, when Laurent arrives in Hanoi and meets… -Shit. -Sorry? Hang on… Just a moment. Let me tell Louise I no longer need her and I'll go and put on a dressing gown. I'll call you back, Christine. The guy never even gave you his number. What do you know about him? His name? I like it that way. We talk on the phone. That's all. He lives his life and I live mine. What life is that? Your mother and her chronic arthritis? Your sister's nervous breakdowns, and Françoise and her ugly baby? Is that your life? -Hello? -Hotel St. Georges? Wrong number. I'm sorry, ma'am. Do you know what you'll do when he calls? You'll tell him, "I want to see you, Thibault." Is everything okay? No. It's a disaster. She wants to see me. What's the problem? What's the problem? She's expecting Hemingway. What? I told her I was an important reporter. I've been everywhere. Nigeria, Cambodia, Zaire, Vietnam. I've done it all. But wait. There's more. I'm a writer too. Yes. I write. Novels, stories. A mix of Malraux, Cassel, Hemingway. Idiot. But still, she knows who you are. No. That's just it. I only gave her a first name, Thibault. Yes. Why Thibault? Do I look like a Thibault to you? The lies I've told her. I also live in a big family house. With a grand library full of books. The table I work on is solid oak. And sweet Louise, my faithful housekeeper, brings me cold vichyssoise every night. Yes. I understand why you told her all that. I myself once corresponded with a young woman, a Swedish woman who worked at the Alliance Française. Did you also make up a bunch of lies? No. On the contrary. I simply omitted one or two details. Such as? That I was Black, for example. And I never went to our meeting. But your situation isn't quite the same. You're white. I'm not so sure. Come on. Be brave. Call her back. You won't disappoint her, I'm sure of it. It's right there. Go on. I do six newsflashes a day, so my voice is recognizable. Yes? It's Thibault. Hi, Thibault. How does 7:30 p.m. tomorrow at the Hotel Scribe bar sound? I'm sorry, tomorrow's no good. Can you give me two or three days? Sure. How about Wednesday? The bar is on the corner of rue Scribe and boulevard des Capucines. I'll be wearing a red tie. Great. You'll have a red tie and I'll be wearing sunglasses. See you tomorrow. Wednesday, I mean. I forgot what day it is. Bye. Goodbye. -Is this the one? -That's the one. Thank you, honey. I'll be right back. What is it? I don't know. It's from Maurice. You two are ridiculous. First you break my nose, then he sticks a thorn in my foot. Do they hurt? Terribly. But they'll do. I'm scared, Françoise. I look like a hick. What's a hick? A 40-year-old journalist with no ambition. Sentenced to hourly newsflashes and forced to pay half his income in alimony. A sleazebag. I think you look great. I've had it for seven years. That's not too old. Maybe not for a kid, but for a suit… You're going to be late. Let me ask you something. If I were Hemingway, how would I walk into a bar? What's so funny? I was going to say, "Through the door." It's a joke. This is a stupid idea. I should have continued lying. I should have borrowed Julienne's Range Rover. Bought a pipe like his. Worked the big-shot reporter angle. She's obviously in for a surprise. Do I look ridiculous? Is it okay? You look very nice. No, I don't. I'm scared. My feet hurt. Give me a cigarette. What time is it? Is it okay? So, that's the rallying sign. I'm headed to the slaughterhouse. -Sir? -A dry martini. -A gin and tonic. -Yes, sir. Good evening, sir. No. A whiskey. Yes, sir. LADIES' ROOM Good evening. Good evening. Please. Thanks. I thought you'd never come. I didn't expect such a lovely surprise walking into this bar. Not too disappointed? Disappointed? Sometimes our hopes don't live up to reality. Yes… Do you have plans this evening? No, I'll leave that to you. Do you know that man in the red tie over there? Yes, sir. What's his name? Why do you ask, sir? What is his name? This is a dry cleaning receipt, sir. Sorry. That's Mr. René Martin. He works for a local travel agency. Can you call him? What? Can you go to him and say, "Mr. Martin, you have a call"? But… That's the same receipt, sir. Sorry. -I'll say the call was disconnected. -Exactly. What do you suggest? We can start by getting out of here? -Did you bring a coat? -It's right there. I have a call for Mr. René Martin. Will you excuse me? -Who received a call? -Mr. René Martin, ma'am. -There was no one on the phone. -Really? The call must have dropped. Shall we? You're not Thibault? Excuse me? Your name isn't Thibault? No. My name is René. Why? I was waiting for someone named Thibault. I'm sorry. I don't understand. It's a misunderstanding. Goodbye. Really? Well, goodbye. -I'll get you another drink, sir. -Yes, thank you. Is that clock working? Yes, ma'am. Hello? Who's calling? Just a moment, please. Yes? Hello? Good evening, doctor. I'm sorry to call you at home, but… -Is there a problem? -Yes. What's going on? I feel like crying. I'm sorry? I don't know if I can hold it in. I wanted to know if that's serious for my nose. It's not serious, only bothersome. Try to avoid it… Why do you feel like crying? It's 8:45 p.m. and… -All men are bastards! -Ma'am… Maybe so, but that's no reason to ruin my nose! -What? -Don't ruin my work, understand? Yes, doctor. I forbid you to cry, you hear? Yes, doctor. Goodnight. Bye, doctor. -Good evening, sir. -Good evening. Is his tie red? Sorry? That guy. What's the color of his tie? Burgundy. Definitely. I'd say burgundy. That didn't strike you as odd? I asked if his tie was red and you didn't bat an eyelid? I mean… What did you think? That I'm a whore or that I'm colorblind? Actually, I'm a colorblind whore. -Really? -Yes. Are you waiting for someone? -No. -Me neither. Really? Stop saying "Really" and get me the hell out of here. -How much do I owe you? -42 francs, sir. -Do you have a car? -No. -We'll take mine. -It's in the shop. My name is François. Perrin. François Perrin. These small cars are so practical… For parking… -They're… -Leave. Please leave. I'm sorry I brought you out here. I don't know what came over me. So be nice, don't ask questions and leave. Go on. No, please don't cry. My nose. Sorry? -My nose is ruined. My feet hurt. These damn boots! I can't cry. What a fool I've been! My nose! Wait. Let me get my handkerchief. I can't take it. That bastard! I can't cry. What a fool! Help me, for God's sake! Help me pull my boots off! There! Not like that… I can't get them off like this. -How, then? -Let me get out. Give me… turn round. -Wait. -This way. You're hurting me! That hurts! My nose! -Come on. -Bastard! I can't get it. Hang on! Bastard! Filthy bastard! My nose! -What's going on here? -Nothing. I'm removing her boots. My nose! Did you hit her? Did he hit you? Her feet hurt. How did you get these on? -We need a tow truck. -Why is she talking about her nose? -Did he hit you? -Shit! -Are you talking to me? -You'll have to excuse her, officer. She doesn't know what she's saying. She's tired. Ignore her. I'll join you. Let's go home. Yes. Mind your language, ma'am. She will. -Thank you, officer. Goodnight. -Goodnight. Goodnight, ma'am. Shit! It won't be much longer. You must think I'm insane. Not at all. I was stood up by a guy tonight. I don't need to know. You might as well know why you're here. I didn't know I cared so much about him. I kind of snapped. Goodnight. Can't we have a drink? No. That wouldn't be much fun for you. -Sorry about everything. -Not at all! -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Can I call you? If you like. I'm in the phone book. Christine Clément. -Bye. -See you. Well? How did it go? Like this. I got you some croissants. If I had gone up with her and taken her in my arms, maybe I could have told her the truth, but she closed the door in my face. They're supposedly sexually liberated and have sex with anybody, anytime. They may be liberated, but not with me. I didn't even get a nightcap. She left me at the door and I came home alone. Can you tell me why they are sexually liberated without me? Why am I left out of all the sexual liberation? May I be frank? Sure. I'm also left out. These croissants are good. They were warm when I got them. What's she like? Physically, I mean. Not bad. Then it's no big deal. No. I like her. But it's ruined. Don't say that. You'll see that it's ruined. Hello? Christine? It's François. Oh, yes. I wanted to invite you to dinner tonight. I'm sorry. I can't tonight. Okay. How about tomorrow? I can't tomorrow either. Do you not want to see me again? No, I do. I just need to get ready. I'll call you later. Bye. You don't have my… There you have it. She never even looked at me yesterday. All she could think about was that jerk Thibault. Hello? Christine? It's Thibault. Yes? I wanted to apologize for yesterday. I found myself in a bind and I couldn't warn you. It's crazy. I almost had to go to Africa. I was about to leave for our meeting, the phone rang, it was the paper. Something big is happening in Tanzania. Colonel Doumba's troops invaded the North and there could be war. I ran to the office and tried to call you at the bar, but it was engaged. Hello? -Hello? -Yes? Anyway, it worked out. Colonel Doumba was killed. But we missed each other. I'm terribly sorry, Christine. -Hello? -Yes. I was just saying I'm terribly sorry. It's fine. I met a fantastic guy. What? I didn't stay single for long. Really? Did you have a good time? Very good. It's funny how it happened, actually. I waited for you for a half an hour. I was about to leave, when suddenly a man walked in with a red tie. Funny, right? So I smiled at him and was immediately disappointed. He was too handsome. I don't like very handsome men. I quickly found out he was intelligent too, so I confirmed my first impression. Isn't it funny how the evening worked out after a misunderstanding? Very. He took me to a charming bistro. And boy, how we laughed. We laughed and laughed. -Really? -He's hilarious. He has a way of telling stories… On that shelf. In the cupboard on the right. Yes. Sorry? Sorry. He's asking for the sugar. Who is? His name is François, if you must know. Really? Is he still there? Yes. He's here. I'm bothering you. I'll call you later. Not at all! Don't hang up. There. He finished his coffee and I saw him to the door. He's gone? Yes. He left for work. I also need to get ready. Christine? Yes? Shall we have dinner tonight? If you'd like. Well, actually… I don't think I can compete with such a handsome, smart and funny guy. Have dinner with him and we'll talk when you're sick of him. -Thibault! -Have a nice evening, Christine. -Listen to me, Thibault! -Talk to you later. A guy who lands himself in such an idiotic situation, is there a word for that in Senegal? An idiot, Mr. Perrin. …commended the rescuers… Sorry! …who fought… …for over five hours to save the three workers… The three workers… The three workers? -To save the three workers. -Yes… Hang on. Shit. You're going get fired, you know. If you keep messing up your job, they won't miss you. One, two, 3,50, 93,50. I only got 80. I gave you 90. Count it yourself. You gave me 80. No, I gave you 90. So? Call the police. Search me yourself. What's the problem? Nothing. I just supplement my income by stealing from my clients. She said she gave me 90, but she didn't! Well, here it is, ma'am. It's no big deal. Please excuse her. she's a little troubled right now. I'm telling you, he'll call. What a fool I've been! I wanted to make him jealous. Him! He slept at my place. What? I told him the guy slept at my place. Why? I don't know. He'll never call me back, will he? You never realize it. I never did, anyway. In my mind, I'm still in my braids, bobby socks and hula-hoop. When I get dressed in the morning, I hop down the stairs. And I go to the mirror in the hallway, the one by the plants. It hits me hard. First, my eyes adjust. And then, that damn mirror wrecks me. And what do I see? A granny. A granny skipping along, and it's me. I said the mirror wrecks me. But that's not true. The mirror isn't a wreck. I am. Look at me. If you liked women, what would you do with someone like me? Do you know what I am? Depressing. No. I'm old. Okay, then. Retire, go live in a old folks' home and quit bothering us. I'm ten years older than you and I don't feel old at all. He won't call. Let's not kid ourselves. He won't call. Go on, answer it. Hello? Who's calling? Just a minute. Is it Thibault? It's François. Come on. Take it. No. Don't be a fool. You'll end up alone. It's better than nothing. Come on. Take it. Hello? Hey, Georges! Say, Georges, I need a hand. I'm telling you, I don't want to. Go on. Make an effort. I don't want to! He's boring. I'm too old to go out just for the sake of it. Come on. Get dressed. He's boring. A loser. You could see it from a mile away! We see thousands of these guys on the streets, in the subway. He just happened to sit next to me. There's something else. He can't be real. Come and see. A bit much, but he's got some style. It's him. Thibault? No. The other one. Hello! Are you ready? -Shall I come up? -Yes. -You'll have to tell me which stop. -What? If we see thousands of them on the subway, tell me which stop. Show him in. I'll get ready. How's this? Divine. Hello… François Perrin. Daniel Granier, Christine's coworker. I'm coming! I'm ready! Take your time. I'm heading out. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Thank you. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. I don't have anything to drink. I'm sorry. That's okay. We'll get drinks at the restaurant. I booked a table. Shit. Don't say a word. I'll deal with this. Officer, I've only been here five minutes. You're not going to give me a ticket for five minutes! I'm not bothering anyone. This is a bus stop. The bus isn't running at this hour. Be reasonable, officer. I don't deserve a ticket. This is how you get your lousy reputation. I'm not bothering anybody, yet you punish me. So, nobody likes you. What do you expect? -I'm not asking you to like me. -Well, I don't like you right now. I don't like you at all. That's enough, François. He shouldn't kid himself. Nobody likes him! He's vomit-inducing. Watch your tongue. That's enough. I'm done talking. There. Are you satisfied? Do you want another one? That's enough, François. Asshole. What did you just say? I didn't say anything. Good evening, officer. Have a great evening. It fell. It happens. Stay there. I'll be right back. I'm not sure where the entrance is. You have to go around, but the site is closed. There's no need to go around. There's a hole behind that! There's a hole behind that! François! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Everything's fine. I need to find my keys. It's fine. I'll make a game out of it. I'm coming up. Okay… Good grief… I'm fine. François! No! I'm fine. I'll grab on to this. For God's sake! Tricky, isn't it? Do something! Help him! Shit! Sorry! Stop it! Stop it! Pull me back in, why don't you? Okay. Come on. Careful. No! Finally. I'm sorry. It's fine. I guess we'll take a taxi. You're not going like that! Right. Do you mind if I get cleaned up at your place? -Of course. -Please. Your car, you can't leave it here. What? You're in a no-parking zone. Move the car. He can't. He lost the keys. I don't care. Move it or I'll have it towed. I lost my keys, you saw it with your own eyes! I saw no such thing. I'm an asshole. Be nice! I'll handle this. I don't need the key to start the car. Is this car yours, at least? You're tinkering with the engine, so I'm asking if it's yours. Don't you think this has gone far enough? -License and registration. -Don't argue. Give them to him. Your name is Julienne? Yes. Well, no… No? This is a friend's car. My name is Perrin. That's funny. Your name is Perrin. The car is registered to a Julienne. You don't have the keys. That's funny. What if we went to the police station to unravel the mystery? I can't stop myself. I'm going to say it. No. Don't say anything. No. I'm going to say it. What are you going to say, ma'am? Shit. I heard you this morning. Really? I turned on my car radio. You have a nice voice. Do you know someone named Thibault? Excuse me? Thibault. He's a journalist too. A big-shot reporter. What's his last name? I only know his first name. But he's published novels. No. I don't know him. So I told him… I told him… I told him… A nightcap at your place? Listen, I'm not a big-shot reporter. I'm not a novelist. I undoubtedly have the least glamorous job in journalism, but I'm ready to visit every Paris police station with you. And there are 58, not including the suburbs. Then Mom left again, so I was alone. Not for long though, because my sister showed up and it started all over again. If I told you you were the first man to come up here since… That long? If you had come up just six months ago, we'd be sitting on Mom right now. She slept on the couch. Really? I don't know why people think I'm strong. My mom, my sister, Françoise. Everyone thinks I'm strong. They always tell me, "We never ask you how you're doing. We think you're always fine." Sometimes I want to be asked, "How are you doing?" And to say, "I'm not okay. I'm tired. I've got problems. I'm sad. Help me!" Christine. How are you? Yes? Hello? Hello? Hello? It was him. I know it was him. -Who? -Thibault. What are you talking about? Definitely not! He's a loser who dialed a random number. There are lots of people who get bored at night and… Not necessarily psychos… Do me a favor. Leave, François. Please. I'll call you tomorrow, I promise. But I need to be alone. To wait for that prick to call. Goodbye. I've been a reporter for 20 years, I know them all. There's only one Thibault. FromLe Figaro. Is that him? -Who? -That you dream about. If it's him, you have bizarre taste. Why do you care? You're unhappy because of some guy, and I won't have it! If you're happy, no problem. I'll go away. But I won't see you suffer for a prick. Will you leave me alone? -Want to call him? I have his number. -No! I told you to leave me alone! Very well. Goodbye, Christine. What's his number? -Hello? -Good evening. May I speak to Thibault Deslauriers? Speaking. Who's calling? François Perrin from RTL. Sorry to bother you so late, but I'm preparing a report on big-name reporters and… I would love to meet with you. I'm available. Call me tomorrow morning and we'll make an appointment. Okay. Thank you. I'll call. Goodbye. All right. Goodbye. That's not him, is it? I don't know who your Thibault is, but… I have a feeling he misled you. You stumbled upon a fraud, Christine. Leave. Look… I know I'm not dreamy, but I'm here. Leave. Who knew you'd enjoy yourself this much? Good thing I talked you into it. Stupid fool. There's no other word for it. At my age, dreaming like a schoolgirl. Let's get dinner, shall we? A woman who studied pharmacy for six years, works like a man… seems responsible and mature but on the phone, she's a fool. Fifteen years. Fairy tales, romantic novels, Thibault… I believed it all. Anyway, Daniel, it's not true… How could I have believed such foolishness? Why did I need him so much? Let's go. How do you recognize a Belgian in a shoe store? No? He tries on the boxes! He tries on the boxes. Do you know the one about the Jew who invites the Scotsman to dinner? Thanks, Mr. M'Ba. This isn't necessary. You have to leave me alone now. I want to be alone. Leave me. Leave. Go on. You were right, I need to act. And you're going to help me. There's a one in a million chance that this will work. I'm sorry, I'm on the phone with my cousin. The one I'm dining with on the 26th. -He'll call you back. -It's a long-distance call. It took him eight hours to reach me. Joseph? Are you there? -Are you done? -Just a second. We'll call him back. Hello? -Joseph! -You got disconnected. Really? But… You're starting that again? Christine? It's Thibault. I need to see you right away. Can you come to 45, boulevard de la République? Number 45-C, second floor on the right. 45, boulevard de la République. I'll be waiting. You gave her your address. I'LL BE THERE IN A MOMENT. COME IN… THIBAULT. PLEASE PICK UP. THIBAULT. It's Thibault, Christine. I'll arrive in a minute. But first, I'd like to show you my world. Are you there? Yes. Do you see the door facing the entrance? -Yes. -The cord is long enough. You'll be able to walk there. Go ahead, Christine. Are you at the door? Yes. Okay, now… open the door. This is my library. This is where I eat every night on my big oak table. Surrounded by my favorite books. You'll see Louise's vichyssoise. Louise… is the grocery store. What she sells isn't great, but it's on my way home from work. I think I've filled you in on Thibault's living environment. Now all that's left is to meet Thibault himself. Are you still there? Yes. Okay. Head to the front door. The cord is long enough. Okay. Now, walk out to the landing. Careful. Are you ready? Here's Thibault. Here's Thibault, Christine. I made him up. It's easy. You just need a plastic bag. And… you have to be alone. You can hang up and leave. I'll understand. Hello? What? That must be for me. Thanks. Hello, miss. Hello? Joseph! Really? Really? Okay. Goodbye. That's my cousin from Senegal. He isn't coming to Paris after all, so I'm also free on the 26th! Subtitle translation by: Liberty Alice Johnke
