Okay, I'll be there. You can stop looking! Le?s go! You're right after all. Chico is dead! No kidding! What happened to his body? - There was an accident. - What accident? Stop playing dumb. Chico's car got hit by a train. He was at the wheel. - Chico? - Yes, himself. Tha?s impossible! Chico was inside that trunk. He was dead! - How could he drive his car? - Don't raise your voice to me. - What should I do with this guy? - Alcohol test? I have no more patience. You can't leave. I'm telling the truth. Chico was killed right here. Where are you going? I almost forgot. Look what I found while you were talking to the guy. You set this up with Suzana to mess with me? - Wha?s the plan? - I have nothing to do with Suzana. She convinced me the child was mine. It was nothing but a scheme of yours. What do you want? Money? Is that it? What are you talking about? I told you I have nothing to do with Suzana. And the trip to Brazil. With who? Huh?! How could I be so blind! You just didn't expect the child so early. Wha?s this shit? I?s a pair of overalls. Look at the inscription on the back! PENITENTIARY MC-7 Rita! I?s my sister! Sorry, I didn't see you! Le?s take her to the hospital. No, don't touch her. Her neck may be broken. - I'm calling an ambulance. - Hurry up! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What were you doing in the middle of the road? Chico... Chico is dead. He was hit by a train. We need an ambulance, fast! In my trunk. - Calm down. - Go to my car. - Your car? - I?s on the dirt road. On the other side? - The ambulance is on the way. - Thank you. - Put this under her head. - Be careful. Stay with her. Go check on the ambulance. Tell me what happened. I didn't do anything. I stopped. I walked away from the car and when I go back, he was there. Someone wants to incriminate me. Why are you saying that? Because Chico and I had an affair. With Chico? Please, don't be mad at me. - Why didn't you tell me before? - You wouldn't understand. This day won't stop! What should I do? Everyone will think I killed him. Don't you worry. This has nothing to do with you. Someone knew I had an affair with Suzana. You and Suzana? I would understand you better than you think. See this? I lost it three weeks ago and just found it in your trunk, next to the body. - You shouldn't have touched it. - It could have fingerprints. - Don't worry. This is the work of professionals. What should we do? Don't know. Hello! Can you give me a ride? - Jump in the back! - Thank you. Hello! I heard mud is good for the skin. - Alberto. - Alex. Pleasure. Go with her. I'll meet you later. ESCAPED CONVICT There was a serious accident. I had to come. The body is unrecognizable but there's no doubt i?s Chico. We identify his car and his clothes. - Wha?s this place? - I?s the perfect spot! Alberto, what should I do with you? Tha?s not funny, Chico! Stop it! Who's the other ticket for? - Chico, what are you doing? - Just warming up the conversation. You're doing what? Don't do anything stupid, Chico! Chico! - Have a nice day. - Bye. Wait, wait! Alex! You forgot this. Thanks. Thought I'd lost it. Alex, wait! Come back here! Stop right there! You're the one banging Suzana. But I didn't kill Chico. I swear! Maybe you didn't kill Chico, but you're gonna tell me who did it. Come over here! C'mon, sit down! You're gonna tell me everything you know. Spit it out! Step on it, Alberto. Finally, this is it! Listen, guys... Isn't this a cool place or what? You've made us walk all the way here to see this shithole? Actually, I have something else to show you. I'm just not sure if you have the stomach for it. C'mon dude, are you kidding?! Hold on! I'll show you but under one condition. The two ladies will have to strip for us, first. Excellent idea! I think i?s fair! Without music, there's no strip, guys! She's right! No music, no strip! I don't think that will be a problem. I hope what you have i?s worth it! - After you! - Com'on. Now i?s your turn! I told you, you guys don't have the stomach. Cut the crap, will you?! Are you sure about this? What are you waiting for? Guys, get your magnifiers ready. Alex is showing us his dick. Watch out, i?s dark and dangerous! Wha?s that shit? Open your eyes, you dumb shit! Where did you get that, Alex? Tha?s secret. - Is that real gun? - Of course i?s real. Are you crazy? Is that thing loaded? Of course not. This is awesome. You stupid asshole! Don't ever do that again! If you want to play, do it the right away! Is this ready to fire? What the hell are you doing, Alex? I knew you couldn't handle this. Dou you think you're Mr. Cool just because you have a gun?! My father has been a hunter for twenty years. He's the biggest loser I ever met. This is not a hunting gun. Tha?s for sure! I bet you never fired a single shot in your life. Maybe you're wrong. He's as a real cowboy and we didn't know. Will you stop this nonsense? I have a bad feeling about this. Didn't you hear what I just said? You're a total moron! And you're blind too. Maybe the bottle dodged the bullet. Look where it hit! You've put a hole in the car's ass. Look for the bullet inside. Maybe you can use it again. He's dead! You shot him in the head. Wait! I have to go back. - Why did you stop? - I have to go back. Are you crazy? What for? Trust me, Diana. Go with them. I'll be find. I you go back. I'll go with you. You'll have to trust me. I have to do this by myself. - Take out stuff. - You'll get into more trouble. C'mon, Diana. Do this for me, please. Don't say I didn't warm you. - Rui, you gotta help me. - Doing what? I know the guy inside the trunk. - What do you mean you know him? - I?s Suzana husband! The same Suzana you've been banging? Exactly! - You're totally screwed! - Tha?s why I have to go back. - What are you gonna do now? - I gotta get him out of that trunk. Are you nuts? How do you know you even killed him? What do you think he was doing in that trunk? - Someone put him in there. - What if he wasn't dead? What if it was my shot that killed him? It wasn't your fault! We were all there and we saw it. But I was fucking his wife. I?s totally suspect! - Diana knows about it? - Are you crazy? She would kill me. You're in deep shit! Sooner or later, someone will find the body. Our prints are everywhere. - There's no way they won't catch us. - And how do you plan to avoid it? We dump the body somewhere else but we leave no trace. What about the bullet in his brain? - I?s not my gun. - Well, who's gun is it? Have no idea, I found it in the motel. - The same place you meet Suzana? - Yes, but it doesn't matter, now. Does she know about the gun? No. I found it lying under the bed while she was taking a shower. It must belong to some truck driver who stopped there for a quickie. - This is some heavy shit! - We better hurry! - Wait! - What is it? - There's someone there. - Where? Over there! Can't you see? - Who's that guy? - How should I know?! Le?s do it now. He's not looking. You go first. - C'mon. - I can't do it! You have to help me. I can't. This is making me sick. He has a hole in his head. - C'mon! - I can't, I can't! I covered his head. C'mon, now! I can't believe this shit. You're such a chicken. Okay, I'll be here! We have to stop. I'm dead tired! - Now, what do we do to the body? - We can bury him. - With what? - With dirt! And where is the shovel? Are you gonna dig with your hands? - I didn't think of that. - Airhead! What was that? What do you think? It sounded like a gunshot. Maybe hunters! It scared the hell out of me! We have to move on. I can't carry the dead guy any longer. - Yes, you can. You gotta help me! - I'm telling you. I can't. We have to take him out of here! Le?s go! - Alex, wait! - What is it? There's a car! - Shit! Can you see anyone? - No. Just a car, right there! - Anyone there? - No. - But the trunk is opened. - I know, but I can't see anyone. - Help me with the body! - What are you gonna do? You'll see! See if the way is clear. There's no one around. Hurry up! Hurry! Le?s go! - We should split up. - You think so? I?s better if we aren't seen together. I think you're right. I'll go this way and you follow that road. Rui... - Thank you for helping me. - You always get me into shit. - See you tomorrow at school. - You be careful! - Can you give me a ride? - Jump in the back. Tha?s exactly how it happened. Now, what should I do? Wait... Come with me! - Where are you going? - C'mon, you'll see! If you explain to me how Chico ended up dead and half naked... ...I'll tell you how he got into that trunk. You know, Chico hated tight spaces. Headquarters wants confirmation of the escaped convict. There's no doubt. I?s definitely the escaped convict. Okay, we'll report to the department and send someone to clean that mess. Okay. Over. I'm sorry but I have a plan to catch. - Alex, good luck to you. - All the best to too. Jacinto, thank you! Have a great trip. You and whoever is going with you. Thank you. Excuse me! Can you please change that song? Hello! I'm really serious. This song gives me such bad luck you can't imagine. - Left front. - Thank you.
