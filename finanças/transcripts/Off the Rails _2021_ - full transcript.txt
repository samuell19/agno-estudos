Yeah. No, no. John, I understand. All I'm asking for is a short extension. Yeah. Yeah, n-n-no, it's gonna be great. Cheers. Oh, bugger! Kate Fisher. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So, at nine o'clock, you had six biscuits and two bars of chocolate. And then you said you had an existential crisis. Well, it's less of a food diary, more of a novel, Graham. Good one. Sorry. Do you mind if I take this? Hey, Kate. Are you OK? Oh, no. The director would like to know how long, Miss Blakeley. Quite long. Hey. Kate. You look exhausted. Thanks. Did you ring that guy I suggested? I'm fine. Scoot, scoot. - Sorry. - Sorry I'm late. Driver ran over a pigeon. We didn't think you were coming. - "We?" - Hi, Cassie. Hi. Look, it's us. Where did they come from? Interrailing. Nineteen. Who took that one? Steve. Today we are paying tribute to Anna Farmer. A dear friend, a beloved daughter, a loving mother. Our faith tells us that this is not the end, but rather a new beginning. And now Diana, Anna's mother, will give the eulogy. This is all wrong. It's the wrong order of things. She should be standing up here. Not me, and that's how it would be if I had my way, which apparently I don't. She was too good for this world. She shone a light wherever she went. And she sparked joy whatever was happening around her. She was also the most intelligent woman I've ever known. She knew that every day was a new beginning, but I'm sorry I can't feel like that today because I've lost my daughter and my best friend. They say you should feel relief when somebody you love finds peace. But I'm sorry, Anna, I can't do that because I miss you too much. And now Anna's daughter will play a song chosen by her mother. - Is that...? - Maddie. She looks just like her. - This is unbearable. - Yeah. What is this? It's Blondie. Blondie. ♪ Dreaming ♪ Dreaming is free ♪ Dreaming ♪ Dreaming is free ♪ When I met you in the restaurant ♪ You could tell I was no debutante ♪ You asked me what's my pleasure ♪ A movie or a measure? ♪ I'll have a cup of tea ♪ Just to keep on dreaming ♪ Dreaming is free ♪ Dreaming Diana. Um... that-that was a... A... beautiful service. Beautiful. It was really beautiful. - The flowers were just... - She was a beautiful person. It's a pity you didn't spend more time together. I know. It's just... What with family and work... Yes. So much work. We only get leave for blood relatives. I had to tell the producers Anna was my grandmother. How are you feeling, anyway? I feel as if my soul has been ripped out. She wanted you to have this. She thought the world of you. What is it? Interrail tickets. "Dear Ones. It looks like I took the first train... out." "I miss you already." "We never got to see those lights in Palma Cathedral, but you still can." "Please go again." "Go to Palma, dance at God's Disco Ball for me." "2nd Feb, 9am." She wants us to go back. For the 2nd February? That's in five days. My boys are in the middle of term. I've got a visit arranged with Clay. Why has she left us four tickets? ♪ Colour me your colour, baby ♪ Colour me your car ♪ Colour me your colour, darling ♪ I know who you are ♪ Cover me with kisses, baby ♪ Cover me with love ♪ Emotions come, I don't know why ♪ Cover up love's alibi - ♪ Call me - ♪ Call me ♪ On the line ♪ Call me, call me any, anytime - ♪ Call me - ♪ Call me I'll arrive when you're ready...

Sorry, can I have everyone's attention, please? Everyone? These passes give us unlimited travel on Europe's rail network for one month. However, I have itemised our previous trip, so that Maddie can stop and see all the sights, but we still arrive in Palma on time! Ooh! This is shaping up to be a real hoot. I thought it'd be a good idea if I kept the passports, so we don't lose them this time, Kate. - What the hell? - What on earth is that? A travel pouch. A travel pouch? Like a fanny pack. No, it's a travel... safety thing. It's a good idea. Thank you very much. Mads? Uh, I'll hold on to mine, thanks. OK. I also thought we should have a communal kitty. - I propose 200 euros per person. - A hundred would be enough. I was gonna pay for Maddie. I can pay my own way. Thanks, Liz. Jeez, Liz, when did you start talking like your mother? A communal kitty? We're going to Paris. Paris is a very expensive city. Paris is a city of love. We need men. We need dancing. We need FlouFlou's. Oh, I remember FlouFlou's. Oh. We went there on our first night. It was like stepping into another universe. That's right. We ended up on the bar singing Blondie. Why did we always end up on the bar? Because we were always shit-faced. And because Anna loved Blondie. We should go. I-I don't think it's really appropriate. Well, should I ask my mum for permission? That was a joke. Ah, Paris! Ma belle... How I've missed you! Look, it's to the right. - Liz, get your eyes off that. - No, but... You have to look up at the skies, you know? My map's buffering. It's this way. Bonjour, mes petites. Cassie, I have scheduled loads of time for shopping tomorrow. - Maddie hardly wants to... - What? What don't I want to do? Very good. I'm leaving. I am getting out of here. They're gonna think you're nicking their stuff. I did not come to Paris to go shopping. It is not possible to take outside. And now the alarm. Please, please. This is new. This has just come in. This is for the, uh, girls. More for younger people. For your age I have something... That's put us in our place, hasn't it? Some beautiful things for your age group. Look at me. Has someone taken the sunglasses from...? Oh, you look so sexy. You do look beautiful, but you must tell me if you are trying to help yourself to the accessories. We just put this back. One moment. If you would like to try anything on, we have a changing room there. I'm not gonna feel bad that that didn't fit. A 2014 study showed that the French are actually the most underweight nation on Earth and it's not healthy. What? Don't laugh at me. - Are you gonna buy that? - Uh... no. Maddie? How's it going? It's a bit much. Well, come out and maybe we can judge that. - Oh, my God. - Wow. You look... - Amazing. - Amazing. I'm gonna buy it. Sorry, madam. Declined. You have another card? Uh... N-n-no, please. Try it again. I'll get it. Don't worry about it. Ridiculous. There's plenty on it. Oui. Vraiment? Tres bien. Je suis desolee, madame. A tout a l'heur. Damn. Sorry. I left my phone in the dressing room. Two minutes. I should probably ring John. Talk to her. Hey, John. Hey, it's me. It's Liz. It's your wife. Did you take the boys' swimmers out of the washing machine? So, how's school? I dropped out to look after Mum, so failed all my exams and got rejected by every university I applied to. Right. - I love your dress. - Thank you. It's French. Hmm. Oh, you have, uh... - And gone? - No, it's just, uh... - May I? - Please.

This looks familiar. Which way do we go? Map says left. It's a bit more rustic than I remember. Jesus... Oh. I'm not staying here. If it's where Mum stayed, then it's good enough for me. Can't be the same place. We're not that old. Oh, I'm afraid it is. I remember being drunk on those steps. ♪ Oh, you know her ♪ Miss Groupie Supreme ♪ Yeah, you know her, Vera Vogue on parade Oh, puke. - Oh... - I brought bleach. You've always known how to start the party. This is where Anna and I slept. Just trying to do my best. Just trying to do what we did before. I didn't get a rider from your agent about you having to sleep on a bed of swans. Let's hope this... I don't think anything's changed. This could be the same bed. That would be hilarious. - You OK? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Oh. Thank you. I've got... I've got some more, actually. That's kind. Here. You both looked so good in 'em. Thank you. I'll wear it to Madame FlouFlou's. My pleasure. - Why did you do that? - To be nice. - That's not the point. - Then what is the point? You know very well what. Please enlighten me, Kate. I don't need you buying a dress for me. Can we go and get drunk now like normal tourists? I can't be seen drinking in public. Put it in a water bottle like you used to. I've just got to make a quick phone call. Of course I'm gonna pay for him. He's my father. Seeing as my character got pregnant from an affair... Did he draw blood? Why don't you throw him out on the street, then? - Well, it's rugby. - The audience might think that she'd have learnt the value of condoms by now. Kendra's already killed her husband on a boat. It's ridiculous. Well, you have to stick up for me, Jordan. You're my agent, for Christ's sake. I will be coming, I will be paying. I mean, come on. Really? Really? Girls, girls. OK, OK. I'll call you back. OK. Bye. Let's just go to the Marais. Exceptionally clean pavements. Maddie will like it there. I'm taking her to this bar. - I am right here. - And who elected you leader? Please, Cassie, can we just try to have a nice time, for Maddie's sake? - Where's she going now? - Maddie's going home. Why? Because it's just not the same without Mum. Maddie, wait. She's right. It's not the same. No. I can't take it off... Just do what he says. Just do what he says. Merci. Don't yell at her. Do not yell at her. Um, it... Monsieur, pardon. Maddie, just tell me what it is. It's Mum. What do you mean, hon? Her ashes. I... I wanted to leave a part of her in Palma. It was a stupid idea. I'm stupid. Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit? - Cendres de sa mere? - Oui. Lizzie, what's the next destination on that itinerary of yours? Barcelona. But it doesn't leave from here. It leaves from Gare du Lyon. In an hour. Well, then, we better hurry. I thought we were going back. You go back if you want to. We've a promise to keep.

Zoloft's for children. I'm hot. It's hot. Aren't you hot? It's a hot flush. It'll pass. You know, the menopause, it is just unrelentingly bleak. It's like puberty without hope. I refuse to accept that. I'm not going to roll over and die, just because Aunt Flo has left the neighbourhood. This age is the best age. That's complete bollocks. Of the 32 symptoms of menopause, I have 34. You know, I have got... bald patches on my tuppence. What symptoms have you had? You haven't had that? I get so irritated with people. I wanna kill them if they do stupid things. Noted. I forget what I'm doing, right in the middle of doing it. And my breasts are so swollen. Every cloud... I thought you'd had a boob job. - Hmm. - They do look good. They are magnificent. I remember your mum singing this. She had an amazing voice. Like you. Oh, come on. I remember your Britney Spears concert. Stop. I have no time for the men who write this show. All Kendra is now is five looks, delivered in reaction to a male doctor explaining something to her. So you've got your surprised Kendra. Your bemused Kendra... And my personal favourite. Constipated Kendra? Why don't you just stop? They've got me tied into this shit for another five years. And I can't risk getting sued if I want my son back. I didn't know you were looking for love. I'm not. Oh, look. A sports car. Dumbbells. I've got to do an advertorial for this app and the only conclusion I can reach is that men never fail to let you down. Like Steve. Mum told me that you and Cassie fell out over him. What is that? Ground goat placenta. - Ground goat? - Placenta. - OK. - From Japan. Oh, I understand now! They don't have a word for menopause. - Uh-huh. - You want one? No, I super don't. They call it the Second Spring. It might help with growing back the old... tuppence. They weren't together, you know. You do know that, don't you? They'd split up. And it wasn't an affair. We were going to get married. Unfortunately, he still loved her. Anyway, it's all in the past. - No one since? - No, I haven't had time. As Mum got worse, I didn't really have time, either. How could a judge award Steve full custody of Clay? - You're his mother. - Don't worry. - I'm gonna nail him. - How? I've been building a case. I've kept every letter, every text message. I'm gonna get him. Horrible for Clay. Hi, sweetie pie. Mummy is so missing her boy. I'm still in Europe, honey. I love you very, very, very much. Bye, honey. Cassie? Yeah? Hey, sorry. We're thinking of getting off a stop early. Kate's found a folk festival in Girona. It could be fun. - OK. - Yeah? Wow! - Is this really a folk festival? - I don't care. ♪ One way or another Come on. ♪ I'm gonna find ya I'm gonna get ya, get ya...

You could be talking to anyone. I mean, I could be a serial killer. I'm not. I'm not a serial killer. I'm a musician. I play the guitar. Not that a musician is opposite to a serial killer necessarily. Um... Can I get you a drink? No. Thank you. I should, um... - Yeah. - Yep. Right. Well... who knows? Maybe our paths will cross again. You are evil. - And he's cute. - Yeah. And he's a musician, so he'll know places. We should all go out. We are here for Anna, not to solicit. - Dan? - No. Dan! Bring that cute little tush here.

You look out over the world, then you take one path and leave another and... suddenly, you're at the end of a tunnel, hurtling at a hundred miles an hour towards nothing at all. I agree. It's an absolute shitshow. I shouldn't have married John. I was just so young. I didn't know anything else. It's like signing a contract to say that you'll only eat ready salted crisps for the rest of your natural life. I mean, what about salt and vinegar? - Prawn cocktail? - Yes, OK. He's not the most exciting flavour in the multipack selection, but he is reliable. And he's my one. And... and he loves me. Oh, Kate, Kate, you're only halfway through. It's never too late to find a flavour that you really like. After all, there's so many of them. I do love a ready salted, though. Do you sell pasta, too? Pasta, Rolex, prescription medications. Whatever the Russians will buy, I sell it. ♪ There is a house ♪ Down in New Orleans ♪ They call the Rising Sun ♪ Where many... ♪ Where many... Oh. OK. Uh... You need to have, um, this finger on all the strings the whole time. I should go find my friends. You kiss better than you play. God, I love Italy. Cassie still partying? She's back to her old self. Drunk? God, I love Italy! Somebody's happy. Imagine what we're all going to be like when we see the lights at Palma. Oh, shit. Oh, you crack me up. OK, where's Cassie? She do the jiggy-jiggy with Giovanni. - No! - Yes. Why don't you pack up her stuff? - I'm sure she'll catch us up. - Me? Oh, you are so milking it. Yeah, that is harsh, but fair. I'll hold the car. What the... Fuck. Hi. Ciao, bella. Ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao. - How did you sleep? - Oh, like a log. - A log? - Hmm. It's a good thing. There's no sign of her. She knows we're going for the 11 o'clock. There's another in a couple of hours. That doesn't get there till five. It's cutting it very fine to make the last boat to Palma. You promise you'll call me? I promise. Where is she? I've been trying to make American pancakes. - I don't think it's very good. - Oh, it looks amazing. Are you kidding? Mmm. Mmm! It's, um... Inedible. But thank you. Oh. Cassie. - Ciao. - Ciao. You no take the train? Oh, my God. I need a ride. Grazie. Excuse me. I want you to have this. How could she be so selfish? She knows what this means to Maddie. It is utterly ridiculous! We can just get the next train. Before you say anything, nothing happened. Oh, yeah? And I'm the Pope. We missed the train. There's another one at 12, right? Oh. Oh, my bag! Thank God you remembered. No apology? No explanation? I'm not really feeling your energy this morning, Kate. - Are you so insensitive? - We can catch the next train! Unless you meet another man in the meantime. Are you really gonna lecture me about sexual morals, Kate Fisher? Oh, please don't go there. Please leave it. - You weren't even with him. - There's a girls' code, Kate. You don't sleep with another girl's guy. Why are you so desperate to cling on to the past? I'm not clinging on to anything. Then how do you explain having my letters to Steve in your bag? They are not yours. I don't need to justify myself to you. - No! You need to let go! - You need to tell the truth. I have apologised time and time again. What more do you want? It is not me I'm talking about. She deserves to know. - Cassie. - Know what? Know what? When I rang John's phone in Spain, a woman answered his phone. Said her name was Sabrina. Could have been anyone. - Liz! - Liz. Oh, how can you be so spiteful? She deserves to know the truth. You wouldn't understand that. She's not a pawn to score points off. I don't lie to my friends. No! You use them when it suits you. When it's convenient to Cassie because we're all just supporting characters in your crap little melodrama! And that is why you never saw Anna when she was sick, because she would have stolen the limelight! You are pretty sanctimonious for someone who slept with their best friend's husband! And you're pretty righteous for someone who is drinking herself out of custody! Oh! Screw you! Stop it! Just stop it! Everyone just needs to calm down. Before Madame Bovary tries to top herself again. Kate. Kate, you can't leave! Kate! Kate! It's over, Maddie. It was a stupid idea and it's over. Kate. You don't just fall into bed with somebody.

I found another train back to Paris. Cass is in the cafe. If you and Maddie want to join us... I thought she was with you. No. - No? - No, she followed you. Oh, for goodness' sake. Hey, Cass. Uh-oh. I have been dropped from the show. The producers said that my public image wasn't in keeping with the show's universal appeal. - Cassie! - Steve's won. - I'm gonna lose Clay. - No! Cass, it doesn't work like that. Surely it doesn't. It does sometimes, though. - No answer. - Seriously? What? What is it? On top of every bloody other thing that's gone on, we've now lost Maddie.

Let's go. - Where? - I don't know. - Anywhere. I won't lose her. - Obviously. I will scour the entire country if I have to. Maybe start with Palma. The train left one hour ago before her flight. - How could we be so stupid? - I'll buy the tickets. We can't fly. We haven't got passports. She's going to the Light of God. That's tomorrow morning.
