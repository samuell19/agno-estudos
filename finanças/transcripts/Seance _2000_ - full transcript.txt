SEANCE This "expansion of the subconscious self," is this like Jung's "collective unconscious?" No, it's a little more physical... Yes Interesting, certainly. Indeed interesting... Still a little too hypothetical, I think. But isn't all psychology based on some hypothesis? Well, yes... The spirit invisible. Well, of course. What for instance is... An electro-vocal phenomenon? A finding from Von Seeley's 1956 experiment. Who? Von Seeley, the German medium. And this? "A double. An apparition physically identical to a living being." An out-of-body projection. And it's an omen of death? People around the world have reported seeing their double before death. The common term is "doppelganger." And "Edison's Spiritual Communication Machine?" Confusing fantasy with hypothesis? No, that's fine, but, it deviates so far from the psychological... But you yourself acknowledged these phenomenon are real. Well, sure, but... I know that your work is highly superior. Which is why, frankly, I think it's such a shame. Yes. The world ignores frivolous investigations. Psychology has always suffered that. Which is why social recognition has been a struggle. And remains so. Right. It always takes society time to accept certain realities. Right. Sorry, I went too far. No, you're probably right. But I can't submit it for review in this form. Please understand. Yes. Oh, no. The experiment's off for today. The professor's not a bad guy, just afraid to meet you. I see. I'm very sorry. Oh, no. May I return this to you? How was it? Well... What did you learn? Whoever owned it is no longer alive... You're right. It was my dead grandmother's And also... something wasn't right Meaning? The way she died. She killed herself. Sorry I gave it to you. No, that's all right. Good bye, then. Sato san... Yes? Um, just for instance, could you bring her here noW? My grandmother. I mean, hold a seance. Isn't that your speciality? She was here. Until just a moment ago... Here? I'm not sure it was your grandmother... Here, tangibly here? Yes. Why are they so nebulous? Hmmmm They appear suddenly only to vanish when one calls them. Their circumstances elude me. Right. Got any jet sounds? Have any jet sounds, Sato san? Sure. Something a little higher pitched? Like a fighter plane? Isn't that better? A helicopter? Something a little unsettling, atmospheric. A helicopter? Something gurgly, sounds like bubbles? Gurgly? Like lava. Go buy some drinks. Anything ok? Fine. Break time. Back to the jet? No, you want gurgles, right? Just give me a minute. Like he's watching me from somewhere... Not like I did something bad or anything... But like he's always... observing me. Are they radio waves? No it's not like that. Because after all, you lived together for a year, right? Yes. So you have memories, right? Yes. Where are those memories? Here. Right there? If he's anywhere he must be there. I see... And not all happy memories, right? No... That's true for everyone. You lived with him, after all. Yes, but... Will I be able to remarry with all this? Why? He... Which... Your new man? The one inside you? The one here... He's no longer alive, but... That's right. I wonder how he'll feel about my marrying again. What to knoW?. Yes. You sure? Yes. I'd find it very reassuring to know. I understand. Oh, sorry. Pizza's in the fridge. Yeah. Warm it up? No, no. Sorry. Shinji? Shinji? Shinji! Sorry, not yet. I'm sorry. Just a little longer. He's coming closer. Yes. Oh, she left that for us, I told her she shouldn't. Home-made? Apparently. Huh. It'll be on tomorrow. The showl worked on. Documentary. What time? 8 PM. Satellite. Uh huh. Will you watch it? I can't. Happy to. I liked my sound work. You put time into it. Yeah... Probably pointless on our TV. Let's get a new one. What? One of those hi-fidelity ones... Yeah. Surround something. Yeah. But I don't need to hear all those sounds at home. Right... I... Oh sorry. What? It's nothing, really. What? You're busy, right? No, not at all. What is it? I'm thinking, I should start working again. What? The restaurant needs some part-time help. Really... It'd be good for me... Well of course... But are you OK? Yes, it's time that I made a change. If you feel that way, them I'm all for it. Really? Yeah. That's what I'll do, then. Say, let's have some of that cake. What? The one she left. Oh, right. I'll make coffee. Listen. Is your family rich? You know, the Central Hospital sent me. Your mother fainted. They took her to the hospital. She may be dying. What'll you do? Shall I take you to the hospital? Welcome. Table for one? Welcome. Curry rice. Will that be Java Curry? Curry rice. Large. Yes. Hey. And coffee. Yes. Coffee first? Coffee first. Yes. Excuse me. I'm sorry. What the... Excuse me, I'm sorry... Hey. Yes. Clear this. I'm sorry. Welcome. Welcome. Just about ready. Thanks. Sato San. Um... What's this sound? What? Tape I gave you yesterday. You know, with the sound of the wind. Would you listen? Something strange? May I? Oh, here it is... Like someone's talking. What? Listen. What's he saying? I can't... shake this creepy feeling. Oh, it's just some trucker's CB radio. Really? It happens. Sorry. I'll clean it up. Do you have any trees creaking? What? Wind whipping through trees in the forest. Not immediately. Trees... By the next mix? I'll have it. Thank you. Welcome home. I'm home. You're early. Yeah. Sorry, that's dinner. Where from? Take-out place. Huh. Looks good. I'll get it ready. Oh, sorry, I'll do it. How was it? Your job. Well, so, so, I guess. Huh. Are you working tomorroW?. If you're off, I can put in a half day. Near Mt. Fuji. I see. I'm sorry. Oh, no. Say, let's go together. What? No... Fine with me. But you're working. More like going for a drive. No. OK. Five peaches please. 900 yen. Oh, what? I just got worried... I'm sorry. Been shopping. Thank you. And you know, I quit. My job. Huh. Be a while? A little longer. I'm going to bed. Sure. I've got to do this over. Please mix channels 2 and 3. Completely? Completely. Yes. Um... Is Tazaki san here? Apparently he's not feeling well. Oh... Hello... Oh, hello. Oh, I see. Yes. I'm sorry but I have to decline. No, it's nothing like that at all. Thank you for calling. What do you think? Is she still alive at least? It's what the police want to know. Yes, that's true. Can you tell? Well... Do you have anything else? Well, all her parents gave us, was this. Did the perpetrator have anything? You know, he is a police officer. He can't just blab. No, that's fine... Unfortunately the perpetrator didn't have much on him. I see. No answers while he's unconscious. Will these help you at all? Excuse me. It's all right, Sato san. I'm sorry. Sorry for calling you suddenly. No, it was interesting. Do that stuff a lot? No. But the student's determined. Your criminal profiles are always off. But I was dead serious today. Yeah, I was too, for a minute, there. Take care. I'll call. You felt something, right? You did, right? Yes. Why didn't you say anything? There was no point in giving vague information. But the police are desperate. Vague leads are better than nothing. The police know they might go nowhere. Hayasaka san. That is exactly why people don't take us seriously. I'm asking you. Please let me be. I understand. I shouldn't have panicked. I'm sorry. Good bye. Sato san, here. Please keep it. It's OK. I have police clearance. Please contact me with anything. OK. So a cop turned up? Yes. Didn't feel right. But if it works out, you'll be famous. It won't happen. Never know!. And me? It'd be rough on you. That's right. Guess we'd just be changing places. That's right. Same as ever. Don't want that. Wish something fun would happen. Sure it will, someday. You think? Sure, sure. I know it will. Thanks. What is it? Why? Why? What? So... So close by... What is it. What the hell! The kidnapped girl. What? Why? Since when? What the hell is this... Call the police! Right. Wait. What do we tell them? Well... Call an ambulance first... Oh, right. What do I tell the doctor? She's already dead. All the same, anyway. She's asleep... She seems calmer... We have a training cup? Right, the hospital. Wait. What? Please, wait. I found her... right? Sure. If I hadn't, she'd be dead, right? That's right. But how can I convince them? You're awake? Don't worry. You can go home right away. Quiet! Quiet! You're fine! You're fine, don't worry! Say! Hey! What are you doing? I'm going out. Where? I just need a little time. Just today, is all I ask. ...Hospital. All our lines are currently busy. Please try your call again later. What the... An abandoned building, not far from Tokyo. Probably northwest of the city... I see... And is she OK, the girl? Yes. You seem quite certain. That handkerchief helped. I see. That's great. Can I tell the police? Please wait a little. One more day... I may get clearer on the site. I see. Do I seem strange? No. I know, thank you. You don't trust me? No, that's not it. I'm just wondering why you've become so aggressive. Sorry. I study psychology, after all. Here, it's right here. It's right off this road An abandoned building. We should take her when it's dark. But Junco.. What? She's seen my face. It won't work... How could you let that happen! How could I... You've ruined my whole plan. have to screw up when it really counts! Listen, Junco. What? It never would've worked. We're up against the police. You plan wouldn't have worked. You said if I got famous you could relax... It doesn't matter what... I always believed living with you would... Is this what my whole life is going to be like? Grow old doing nothing until it's over? We just live together, all of a sudden I'm old, and that's all there is to my life? Won't you let me... dream, at least this once? Yeah. Sorry... No... For one day? Sure. Hayasaka san? It's me, Sato. I know where the girl is. In an abandoned building along the Hachioji industrial road. Yes... And it might be the girl, or if not, then something that's hers. Yes, please tell that to the police. She sleeping? Soundly. What to do... What? The girl. We should get her to a hospital. Yes. She's young, she'll think it was a dream. You're right. We can take her when it's night. Yeah. Let her sleep there. Yeah. It'll work, won't it? Sure. Oh, thanks for the other day. Sorry to bother you now. But how did you knoW?. About the girl's shoes being in that building. Well, I... don't know why. I was just born this way. It must happen to you, too. Suddenly, you just see it. Yes, it does. Well, it's like that. Except that usually I'm wrong. Some people aren't. I see... you're gifted. Not 100% of the time. But you seemed very certain about this. So Hayasaka san said. It's usually 50-50 at best, so I can't always be, but this time was different. So depending... Yes. On the person... That's right. I see. I understand. You'll continue to cooperate? Yes. So we found her shoes, but the girl herself's still missing. Tell me, do you sense anything? No, not so far. I see. Well then, Thank you. My husband. He went to bed early. He's go to start early. Shall I call him? No, that's fine. Quiet. It won't be long. Quiet. Oh, no. Officer... Yes? It's just an intuition... not 100% certain at all... but I think the girl will come home safely soon. I can't help feeling that. Thank you very much. He leave? Yes.. the girl? Asleep. I see. What do we do? What do you mean? Now. Well, let's wait 'til night. Guess you're right. Why... I can't. I can't. It's over. Liar! The plan is over. That's a lie. But you said.. Something good would happen... You swore it would. That's what you said! I'm going. What? To work. Don't go. Stay with me, please. No. Please, just today. Today, tomorrow, the next day... It's all the same. You had your dream. Time to get back to living. It's all we have. Get some sleep. Oh, Sato san. Thank you for those tree effects. Sure. Junco? Junco! Sorry, were you asleep? No. I'll make supper right away. Sure. You know I... today I saw... What? I saw the little girl. Over there. And I... realized... that's it's hopeless, just like you say. It's OK... It's OK... Don't worry, OK? Stay in crowds. I'm fine. You? I'm OK. What? It's.. nothing. Hey! Stop sneakin' around! Come out here! It's your own fault! Sneaking into my trunk! You deserved it! Hate the kidnapper! I know... I'm sorry. Go ahead and hate me... But make it me. Not Junco... She had nothing to do with it. Hate me. And now your home has been purified, without mishap or hindrance. I see. Whatever your circumstances, I believe the evil has dissipated. HoW? What? How can you know that? That's... Tell me. What am I supposed to do noW?. Let us see... Peace will be granted equally to all those who live modest everyday lives. To us, too? That depends. We've always lived modestly. The picture of it. In that case, yes. The future? Yes. As long as you stay honest. But hoW? Well... You can't fear being ordinary. Ordinary? I'm a very ordinary man. I see. No couple is more ordinary. If something's troubling your spirit, I'm happy to consult. My spirit is fine. There's just one thing I can't expect. What is that? Fate. I choose my fate. What's wrong? Enough misfortune. I won't let anyone get in the way. Human or not. This is fine. Call me if I can help. Yes. Farewell. Sir... Yes. Is there a hell? What? Does hell exist? It does if you think it does, doesn't if you don't. Which do you? I don't know. I see. It's the same, wherever we go. Yeah. I won't make you unhappy, Junco. I swear I won't... Let's go. Don't look back! There's coffee. I'm off. Yeah. Have a good day. It's strange. Something strange? I can't say exactly until after the autopsy... Yes. Excuse me, I need an audio cable. You're home early. Yeah. We've got company. The professor. Sorry to intrude. And the police officer. Oh, hello. Excuse me. What's going on? What? An experimental seance. What? For the girl. Why? It's OK. Say, can you hear me? You're Yoko, right? Yes. Where are you noW? In the ground... Do you know where? The west... In the grass... Can you tell me more? I see. Then, how do you feel noW?. It's cold... cold... Why? In the ground... That man killed me. The man who took you? The young... man... Let me ask you again... Where are you? In the ground... Dark... ground... I understand. Please stop it. Why? Tell me why. We've found the girl's body. It's at the police hospital now. Too bad, Sato san. What? Why? Junco, drop it. No I won't. What is going on here? That was a performance, wasn't it? Junco. Junco. What are you holding? What do you have in your hand? Show me. Show me. What's that? Was it the girl's? How did you get this? A Film by Kiyoshi Kurosawa
