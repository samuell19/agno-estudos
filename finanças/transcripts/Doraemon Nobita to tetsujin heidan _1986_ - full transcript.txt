Shut up! She can hear you too! Nobita! You are here! I was thinking of going to see you! Be part of this plan! I need to expand the entrance to the world of mirrors! Of all humans, I will give you the most special treatment! Show yourself! Nobita! Doraemon! Let's go! I will not let you escape! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! There is the Exit! Nobita! Help Doraemon!

D ... Doraemon! Let's get out of here! This will go into exploration! Doraemon! I'm here! Where? Are you okay Doraemon? Nobita! Get me out of here! Why did that explosion happen? It was a Destruction of Dimensions tried to rip the different dimensions And this happened! Causing this explosion! That is, the entrance to the world of mirrors was blocked! Definitely! So those annoying robots can't chase us Exactly! Which means that... The earth is safe! It is already dawning! And we haven't slept at all! The earthquake last night was crazy!

You are surprised! What the hell is Doraemon laughing at! The army of steel is coming! So is! Let's run away! Where? Mamaaa! The army of Robots is coming here! And they plan to conquer Earth!

Prime Minister this is not a joke, please do something for the earth! Listen to me a second please! Listen to me please! No one believes us! No one will do anything to save Earth! That is not true! Gigante and Suneo would believe us! They are quite gullible to start! But if we tell them! Good! They could help us in some way! Suneo hasn't come home yet! It is a very important thing! Where is it? Suneo did this for me! From Suneo, sure! Good! I have a riddle! Could you tell me that it is stronger? Well, I ... See if they would fight an adult monkey and a small monkey, who would win? It is clear, the adult monkey Wait! You won't fool me this time! Little monkey! Fuuuuuu! ......... Do not fight !!!! Thanks for your cooperation! Seriously! What are we going to do? We are lost! This is bad! They are our true friends! They believe us! I'm going to defeat the bad robots, leave this to me Thanks for your thoughts, but ... We need a strong ally! How is this? And if we become friends with the Brain! And so do ours! Suneo you are the best Genie of Japan! Yes, I think it will work! Alright, let's do it! So you are the humans! Come and kill me if you can! This is. Are these your dumb friends? How fools? Shut up! Calm down! Doraemon! Come on! Good! What are you doing to me? I've never seen anything like this! What if you change it to something you've seen before? Good idea! Let's try it! Stay still! Here! Take it! At last! Zandaclaus is in the world of mirrors, and now what do we do? Let's make a new entry! You have to look for a flat surface, like a mirror! How was the river? It doesn't work, the water moves a lot Well, there is a place! Where? Shizuka's Bathtub! I thought so. As always Nobita! We should not tell / About this! Do not! We shouldn't involve Shizuka in this, it would be dangerous! We're just going to go! Wuaw! It became a mirror! Good! Let's get in! This is incredible! Everything is turned but it is still the same as our world! Hears! Nobita! You've had this fun world just for you! Hey! Yes!!!! Come on, we have to get to the mountain again!

It seems that it has been like this after the break of the dimesiones! Let's install the brain right now! How terrible, they didn't even ask me! Where will Nobita and the others be? Ah! Nobita? They are steps / ... Someone help me!! What somebody !!! What somebody! ¡¡¡Wait! Ah! Micross, it's you! Wait! I'm scared! How can you talk like that? Where are everybody?

Do not worry. He is watching us! Q / Qu - Wh-What? We're safe! Let's go up! Incredible! We have a powerful ally! Avenge here Robots! We will give you your deserved! Why don't we destroy some robots before the steel army arrives? Sounds good! Let's do it! What is that sound? This place is scary! Let's go! Nobita! Master Suneo! What happened exactly? Nobita! Where have they gone? Nobiiiitaaa! Wait for me Shizuka! Micross! Hurry! Let's help her! ! Who will it be? It's a girl! She is hurt! We must help her immediately! Is a robot! Micross !!! You've seen!

Lilulu, answer me Lilulu, answer me Lilulu! The army has left Mechatopia We plan to arrive tomorrow night Lilulu! What? Tomorrow night? Tomorrow is too soon! It's ridiculous!

Lilulu! What is the problem? There was an accident? Did you forget that you must lead the Steel army to the ground safely? Lilulu! Answer to me! Shut up! Lilulu is not here! That's! Not sure where Lilulu is, but We can't leave her in this room! / an to be sure what to do when they first arrive on Earth That's when we are going to attack! We must not allow Lilulu to communicate with them! But before that, the robots The robots will come back! Do not leave them at the base! So they finally appear! We are lucky that they are not built for battle, but / / there are so many that keep coming! The air cannon has no energy! I do not know! Do-Doraemon! Nobita! Help to! ZandaClaus! Good! We have a superaliate! I forgot! Doraemon! Alright, let's bring the robots here! Come on! V-Come on! Let me go! Why are you doing this? I can't let humans know that I am a robot Micross !!! Because you!! I did it! I have saved Shizuka! The Justice robot, Micross, is the strongest! Micross ... Ah? Help me take her home Why? Are you going to repair it? Shizuka! She is a bad robot! I don't think she is bad! I would probably be broken! I wonder if I can repair it! Micross ...! How should I treat wounds in a Robot? I do not know! Maybe they! Where are you Nobita? Ah here! Nobi-- Shizuka! Nobita! Shizuka! I'm so glad to see you, Nobita! I was so scared NN / o I knew you were here! Found them !, Nobita, quickly! Don't bother man, I'm in the best part! I'll be back! Stay here! It seems it was a pass. They are no match for me! Where is Doraemon? I was here not long ago ... Drawing the metal detector Chalk, and ... /... A loud noise will sound when a robot crosses the line The whole area and the mountain is completely covered! Hey! Doraemon! Doraemon! Shizuka is here? You should have said it before! Is Lilulu a robot? Do you Yes, and she is very hurt! Let's break it now! That is very cruel! But she wants to destroy the Earth! But, breaking it is .... / Very good! Let's fix it! She might be able to tell us / / Something about the steel army Sure! Mecha kit! It takes time, but it is the same as human medicine, It can / renew broken parts simply by applying it! In the affected area! Okay then, please leave the room Robot or not she is a girl! We will prepare dinner! Micross, you too! Me ... Also ... I'm a ... Girl? First. I must clean your body, it's dirty! She looks exactly like a human being! So nobody would know that it is a spy! First, apply gently on the broken area. Apply gently and wrap with poly bandage. The credits do not subtitle them This world was made when we made the world of mirrors So we can do what we want! Instant Soup !, Instant Curry! Fried rice !, Dorayaki !, Hamburgesa! Instant coffee! I've always wanted to eat a whole ham! This is good meat, this is going to make good steak! Everything is free! He says I should apply the medicine every two hours! This is going to be a sleepless night! Who... ...It's you? You are aware! How happy I am! Doraemon medicine is taking effect in a short time! Why? Did you help me? If I didn't, you could have died! To die? Do you mean break me? What's more What if I break you? In any case, my mission ...! Do not move! Your wounds will not heal if you move too much! You have to rest a little more. Shizukaaaa! Shizukaaaa! Micross, what's up? They said: Time to Eat! Eat? What would they have done? Everyone is excited, it's like camping! Wauw, it looks good Come quickly, it's a barbecue party! Is it ok to start a fire here? We can do anything! Bon Appetite! Delicious! Suneo, the meat is wonderful! It is very good for Suneo! In fact, he took lessons from a famous .. Rays! He's not made to eat food! What a bore! I'm going to a patrol What an annoying robot! Sure! Like you! By the way, how is Lilulu? It seems that she is improving You better be careful. She is a spy of the robots that want to take over the Earth, you know? I'll be fine, you can't even move yet. The Army of Steel ... I wonder where they are. It is the metal detector of Robots! There is one very close! Let's go guys! By accident I have stepped on the detector line Well, don't go there! You are annoying and useless! That you can't stand still? Well, we have to practice for tomorrow. Now we know that we can trust ZandaClaus! Anyway! Rest! Yes! We have finally arrived! Yes! Do you have a good plan? This incredible strategy is about to emerge, and ... Nothing! I wonder if the Robot army ... I don't know! Probably! Ah? He has fallen asleep! I have to do something... Lilulu is what bothers me. Wuaw! The wounds begin to heal, just a little more! You will regret saving me. Why? Why are you a robot? I don't care at all. Humans will soon be enslaved by Mechatopia. Enslaved? That's terrible! Terrible? What is terrible? Robots are the rulers of the universe! That is the destiny that God has for us! That's ridiculous! Robots have been created / by humans! In Mechatopia there is no single human. Then how? Long ago Long before humans existed on Earth. There were many humans around the Galaxy. But God abandoned them. They were selfish. Greedy ... Eager to kill each other ... God took us to an uninhabited planet And He created Am and Em and He said: Robots! They create a society worthy of being called Heaven! Am and Em created their descendant robots! Over time, the robots that govern and those that are governed appeared. Aristocrat robots and the rich began using slave robots. However, a robot revolution for equality finally banned slavery. As a commitment, it was decided to use human beings. Do you understand now? Robots are the children of God. The universe exists for robots! It looks a lot like human history. God would be very disappointed What are you saying? Do you suppose that robots copy human history? Take this! You must not get up! Take this! I do not know you! It would have been better if you broke up! I wanted / Be your friend ... I can't leave her I already have it! It is our only chance! I'm late! I'm late! I'm late! I'm late! Reaction to! I think I have an idea to save Earth! Really? Emergency meeting! We will use the Oil of entry to this world in front of the lake we visited / / and we will make a great entrance! From there, we will attract the army of robots to the world of mirrors! That? / N Are we going to cheat? Are they going to fight with themselves? I will think about that later. In any case, it doesn't matter if this world falls apart. They will fight against nothing! I see! But how will you do it? We will sound the alarm that ZandaClaus has / to pick up these parts. Will it really work? There is a problem We will be in trouble if they find out that they are in the world of mirrors. Shizuka! What is lilulu doing? It's getting better and better! Pills to Sleep the Robots! Give this to Lilulu and she will sleep for 24 Hours! It is understood! We are going to separate. Nobita and I will go to the lake. Suneo and Gigante, Take care of the robots in this area! Better Your wounds have healed completely! No more medicine is necessary! You can use whatever you like. This will fit you well. I do not understand humans ... Why help an enemy? I do things that don't always make sense / is to be human. If you take this medicine and sleep a little, you will be fully recovered. Here you have. She is already asleep! What effective medicine? Oil is spreading all over the lake! Micross, over here! Bang! How is that? Are you alright, Suneo? Look! It looks like a cockroach! The instant glue gun from Doraemon is amazing! Being like this! Come on! Hopefully they bite the hook ... We will have to wait until tonight. I don't see any more robots! Probably not many left. Where is Shizuka? I think he went to buy food for dinner tonight. They will not come ... I wonder if this signal is working. Look at the surface of the lake! Eh what? Stop Emitting !, ZandaClaus! Flashlight Reducer! Let's hide! Why have you reduced it in size? They are too many! Excellent. First we will destroy the most important cities ... ... and sow panic in humans! Destroy them all. Gi-gi-giant !, Ya, Ya, Ya are here! L-Lo-Robots are all over the sky Wow, they are here! Shizuka! Doraemon, he did it! Come back to the House, Shizuka! They will find you! But but! Hurry, we have to get in! We are back! The plan to attract is a success! The army is heading to the city! As expected. That's why we set traps all over Tokyo. Human beings are retaliating! Destroy that building! Capture the humans! Hey! There is nobody here! What's going on? They were fighting against us, where did they go? This is too mysterious. We cannot stop until they are afraid. Keep attacking! Who is fighting the army? Alright, here's the secret. This is an improved version of the echo mountain. It can echo sounds, lights and explosions. I've put a lot of this in all of Tokyo! I see! So they are fighting against themselves! Stupid robots! AND-! This! ... Hey, Lilulu got away! This was terrible! And now what do we do! She knows everything about the world of mirrors! We have to find it before them! It has already dawned! Let's spread to look for her! We have ... -... Destroyed the city that was most important for this country! They even counterattacked. Where are they, they shot us from the rooftops of these buildings But nevertheless, How weird ... There is not a single human! Where did they go? A city of this size should have more than one million inhabitants. It is impossible to hide. There are many other countries beyond the ocean. Are we going to expand our operation? We have no other choice 2/3 Parts of the steel army, go to other Countries! Look in every corner of the earth! Here! Can we trust the search stick? Its effectiveness is 70%! It's better than nothing! Here! Wait! That was close. Is this really true? Let's do it again. Yes! See, it's not like that. Nobita that means you just have to go this way. Thats weird! Come on! Why will he be here? Who? Anyone there? Lilulu! Where are you going? You know, right? To the headquarters of the robot army. You can not! Come with me! Please! I will fulfill my mission. Lilulu! D-I'll shoot if you leave! I will really do it! Well, shoot me! No I can not. You are a coward! Please react, Nobita! You're good? Lilulu! So she was close, after all! She went there. The base is finished! I could not make contact due to an accident. I get it! So, this case can be dismissed. But nevertheless. Why is there no human in this big city? It's here! Lilulu! What's going on? Explain me! Where are we going to look for slaves? I will not answer you! How? What are you saying? Slave humans ... ...it's a mistake! What are you saying? Humans are just crap! They are not garbage! They have feelings, even more complicated than us! Shut up! Your thought circuit must be broken! God has chosen us as the rulers of the universe! He wanted us, instead of human beings to make an ideal heaven! You're wrong! I don't think there is a sky just for robots! But heaven is for all who live in the universe! Don't you think we are betraying the desires of our God? Stop taking humans as slaves and go to your world! Traitorous! Take it to the base and lock it up! Fly faster! Run away Lilulu! ¡Terricolas !! Don't overexert yourself, you're not even fully cured yet! Can we really trust her? It is true! Lilulu almost risked her life to keep the secret! She is our ally! Yes, now! He does not trust me. I ... I think the slavery mission is wrong. But I can't betray my homeland, Mechatopia ... I can not! I don't even know that my heart is telling me! Lilulu! Come? She said she can't betray her allies! We can't trust her! If you can trust! You do it, huh? Wait! Please lock me up somewhere! Reports, sir. / Three cities were attacked at the same time. However, according to the respective commanders, there was no single human. Than? Those humans! What's going on?! This is the opposite of the maps we have seen in Mechatopia! I see... This is a cleverly designed false world! We enter a lake when we arrive. On the other side is the Royal Land! Call back all the soldiers! Let's reform and continue the slavery mission! Flashlight Reducer! I'm sorry, but not for long. I'm sorry, but please wait in the cage. Shizuka ... Forgive me for worrying like that. Do - Dorae-mpn! The robot army is going somewhere! I wonder where they are going The lake! I imagined it! Lilulu was with us all the time! Then who ... /...Has been, / Then the real world is going to be destroyed! We have to stop them! Good! Let's go to the lake! Are we going to fight them? Shizuka, Micross, stay here. Micross, we depend on you! Yes sir! If necessary, use the replacement pocket items. Come on guys! Hurry up! Yes! Well, they're not here yet! Yes. The mountain of echo is not going to be enough this time! We have to fight! Air cannon, Shock gun, Fan blanket, Reductive flashlight ... Choose whichever you prefer. Too... The hoop to go through We will hide from them to fight. We will put eco mountains as much as possible. We have to increase our firepower as much as we can! They are here, hide yourself! I'm scared mom! They will know what is good when they arrive! I must protect the earth! Now! An ambush by the army! Take this! They hide in the forest and move forward! They don't have a chance! They must be in a fierce battle for now .. \ I hope the boys come back safe ... In the end, I'm just a cowardly robot! Ahh, I am a useless robot! It's not your fault! How has it become? Did God make a mistake in creating Am and Em? It's true! Your god created those imperfect robots! They should go to the past and complain about it! Well thought! Well ... Complain about God ... Ah! I have said stupid things again! Is not that! It's a great idea! Ah? Your wonderful idea can save the earth! My idea? Why? Do not think about it! Lilulu will you help me? What I can do? Let's visit your god! How will we do it? With the Doraemon replacement pocket, Flashlight! Go does nothing to them! Oh no! I ran out of energy! Very good! What are you doing! ZandaClaus Flashlight! J-Judo! Well, OK! Keep it up! Yahoo! Suneo, did you see that? Amazing! Hurrah! Rays, it has been modified! Don't think this is over! Withdrawal! Follow me Lilulu. Now we will use the door anywhere! We will enter through this mirror, Ah hello! Ah yes! Welcome! Hurry up, come on! Sorry ma'am Sorry, we are in a hurry! Madam you always look young! Wow, what a gentlemanly robot. Nerd.. See you later! Ah! Wait! Where is Nobita? What's going on? How long ago was Mechatopia created? 30 thousand years from now. 30 thousand years ago ?! Well, 30 thousand years ago! Can we go to Mechatopia with this machine? There will be several loops! Leave it to me! Here we go! Loop! Loop! Loop! \ N Did they leave? I don `t believe. They are waiting for the robots that are in the other countries to return. ZandaClaus will be watched. We will rest until they arrive. This is Mechatopia from 30 thousand years ago ... In our time, this place is covered with skyscrapers. all the streets / are full of robots ... It's like looking at an unpopulated world right now! But your god has to be somewhere. The scientist who gave up human beings and has decided to make a robot paradise. I see! The person who made Mechatopia can stop the army of robots! / I am a good robot! Calm down, Suneo! Calm down? The steel army will attack again! And that?! I know the results ... N \ I understand It's like when you take an exam and know that you are going to fail .. Don't waste any more time! Think positively! We can think of a perfect plan! They are already here! I see ... I didn't even imagine the possibility. My Am and Em are good, but ... ... Your descendants, I see ... It is already decided! I will modify Am and Em's brain! What I am asking for is not for Am and Em, but the army of robots on Earth. Already. The descendants away from Am and Em are part of the army of robots. I have to change its method of evolution. I understand. Thank you! I will give you an affectionate heart to feel sympathy for others. I hope I can finish earlier / because I won't resist anymore ... That's! Those gift everyone. I congratulate you for making this fight more enjoyable! But the game is over. Attack them all! Ahead! This will change drastically to Mechatopia as we know it 30 thousand years from now. It will look like heaven that I really imagine ... So .. the horrible army of robots ... History will change those terrible things will disappear! Shizuka! I'm happy! Earth will be saved!
