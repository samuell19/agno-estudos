Welcome back to the world of the living. So? Good morning, Tessa. I'm Dr. Sarkisian. You've been in a very bad car accident. You ruptured your heart due to trauma, which we were forced to repair surgically. Tessa? Morning. - Morning. - I made pancakes. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm gonna go shoot photos. Oh, it's so cold outside. Yeah, I just don't want to miss the morning light. Well, maybe when you're back, we could do a little research for colleges. All right. Bye. She hides behind that camera. She's not taken a single picture of us. You're too pretty. You'd break her lens. Hey, I told you. You've gotta let her come to you. - It's been a year. - Signing a piece of paper doesn't make us her parents. Actually it does. You open, Sherman? I am for you, Tessa. Um, I think I'm a little short. That's no crime. I'm only 5'6". Enjoy the show. Sherman, where are the subtitles? You watch. I'll translate. "It's the first time we've met in daylight." "But you're very early." I think I'm just gonna go tell the theater owner. I mean, there's nothing he can do about it. They obviously sent him the wrong print. I can get my money back. I've seen this film before. I don't think you want to miss it. Does it have a happy ending? No. Definitely not. Okay. Then I'll say. "You gonna eat all that chili by yourself? In this heat, you're mad." "I eat chili no matter how hot it is, Betty." "Those bastards." "What?" "Never mind. Kiss me." "Those bastards. How could they do this to you?" I'm sorry. How long was I doing that? I lost feeling about an hour ago, - so I'm not sure. - Why didn't you say something? Um, the movie is a bit of a downer, so... It's a love story. I mean, not all love stories are downers. All the good ones are. Romeo and Juliet, Anna Karenina, - The English Patient. - Mm-hmm. I think it's the ending of a relationship, that's what makes a love story so memorable. What about Pride and Prejudice? Jane Eyre? Those both have happy endings. That's only because the writer chose to end their love stories prematurely. Wow. That is a really interesting way of not admitting you're wrong. Come on! Okay. Picture this. Picture that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't die at the end of Titanic. - Do I have to? Oof. - You have to. Jack Dawson is a jobless, penniless gambler, who possessed, at best, marginal artistic talent. - He saved Rose's life. - Right, of course. But he also love-bombed her and stole her away from her fiancé. And poor Rose was just so hypnotized by that steamy car sex, that she really thought that he'd give her a life of passionate adventure? Please, come on. That's a life of abject poverty and dehumanizing infidelity. Titanic 2. If you thought part one was a disaster... Oh, my gosh. - I... - Time to go! Jesus, this guy is getting a one-star review, for sure. So, um, how did you get so good at speaking French? My dad is a foreign languages professor. So by the time I was 12, he had me fluent in French, Spanish, and Italian. Oh! Oh, my gosh. If I could just read Dante's Inferno in the original Italian, - my life would be complete, I think. - I get that a lot. - Really? - No. No, I've never gotten that before. That's some pretty old gear you got there. You don't shoot digital? No, I don't. I get a much higher dynamic range on film. Plus, I'm also kind of addicted to the smell of the developing chemicals. The fumes make me a little delirious. Kind of like what your eyes are doing to me right now. Ooh. That... - That was really cheesy. - No, no. It was... It was... a little cheesy, yeah. It sounded perfect in my head. - Oh, okay. Then let me imagine that for a sec, okay. - Okay. - Still bad? - It's worse, actually. Somehow, I don't know. Um, I should probably... Yeah, me too. Um, thank you for letting me whisper in your ear for three hours. You are welcome. - Skylar. - What? My name is... It's Skylar. I'm Tessa. Maybe I'll see you here again sometime. Yeah, I'd like that. Oh! My jacket. Sky. You're alive! Come on. I want to show you something. Sky! Bad dream. You called out his name. It's called a visitation dream. We see lots of 'em around here. It's all part of the grieving process. I know. It just felt like Skylar was really here. - Doris would love to hear about that. - Who's Doris? - A patient writing a book on the afterlife. - Okay. The other day, she offered to read my aura. I politely declined. - What is that? - Your belongings from the crash. They closed the accident report already? Well, neither driver had drugs or alcohol in their system. That's usually the end of it. They never even interviewed me. You said you didn't remember anything about the accident? - I don't. - Maybe that's for the best. I'm very encouraged, Tessa. The scan shows your right ventricle is functioning quite well, despite the tear. Finally, some good news. It is more than good. Ninety-nine out of 100 with this same injury die on my table. I did die. Only for a short time. I could see Skylar. Like, he was in this... this crazy white light. What is that? Was she, you know, hallucinating? When the body undergoes severe trauma... ...the hypothalamus can flood the brain - with pain relieving endorphins. - So when can we take her home? End of the week. Tessa needs to be extremely careful these next few months. Any chest pains or shortness of breath, you call 911 immediately. Understand? Jazz? Just give me a second. Jazz? You watch, I'll translate. Hi, excuse me. Are you Doris? I am going to take a wild guess here. Room B424, girl with the broken heart? Relax. I'm not psychic. - Jasmine told me you might come looking for me. - Oh. My condolences. Thank you. Are your hands injured? Excuse me? From the accident. Did you hurt your hands at all? - No, why? - Ta-da! Huh? Oh, come on. Come on. So, what is your book about? It's about ADC's. After Death Communication. Okay, so you believe that dead people can contact us? Along with billions of other people from faiths that span the globe. Sometimes, the departed, they call out to us in voice. And other times, we can smell their cologne or perfume in the air. No matter how they communicate, the message is the same. "I'm still here. And your grief, like a beacon, calls me to your side." And when the separation has been traumatic, like with you and your boyfriend, there's often unfinished business. Like regrets or something? Like things left undone or unsaid. Tessa. We signed you out. It's time to go. He's in the in-between. But he won't be there for long, a few weeks at most. And when he moves on... he's gone for good. - I gotta go. - Oh, wait, wait. Here, take this. It's my first book. - It's a good place to start. - That's okay. He's reaching out to you. Reach back. It's too late for that. Tessa, you're up. Um, this is a photo that I took back in February. Is that how you spend your free time, taking pictures of trees? Well, it's actually not a tree, asshole. It's a cell phone tower, disguised as a tree. It is an allegory for the artificiality of modern life. It's a lovely photo, Tessa. Your technical skills have taken huge leaps this year. - Oh, thank you. - I know you're still a junior, but I think you have a good shot of getting into the Rhode Island School of Design. I'd be happy to write you a letter of recommendation. Thank you. I just... My work's not ready for that yet. Oh? What do you feel is missing? Just like a point of view. You know, something to say that's my own. Well, maybe it's time for your subject matter to evolve. After all, there is something notably missing from all your photos. Yeah, I know. Color. No. People. You know, Tessa, before an artist can find her voice, she has to find a subject she loves. Who or what do you love, Tessa? I should probably... Yeah, me too. Hey, okay. What do you think? - Red? - Noisy colors are trendy. I don't know. I feel like you're kind of taking advantage of your dad's niceness. Of course, I am. My dad is putty when I get straight A's. Hey, yo, Tess! - Hi, Cortez. - Hey, uh, do you have plans this weekend? As it happens, I actually work as Tessa's full-time scheduler, so I can say, with absolute authority, that she does not have any plans - this weekend. - What are you saying? What are you doing? Well, the final crew meet of the season is this Saturday. I was kind of wondering if you 'd come out and take some photos. Uh, sorry. I don't really do sports photography. But if you glue a selfie stick to your forehead, it might be the same thing. Will Judd be there? Well, wherever I go, my rowing partner goes, so... Then we'll be there. "We" will be there? I'll be there as your photo assistant, remember? I'm her photo assistant. Well, the first race starts at 6:30. In the morning? He didn't mean morning, did he? Yup, he did. Do you think Judd can see me from here? - Hey! - You are fired. Give me this. Assistanting is not my thing. My bad. You were the one who dragged me out here. So behave, please. Racers, starting positions. Ready your marks. Row! - Whoo! Whoo! - Yeah! Yes! Whoo! You never said he was hot. - Yes, I did. - No, you said he was cute. Emojis are cute. That guy is like melting my sunglasses, Tess. - I think I'm gonna go. - Are you crazy? You've been obsessed about this guy for like months, and you're just gonna ditch? - I don't know what to say to him. - "Hold me." He just won the race. Congratulate him. Okay. Can I put this on my Story? If you wanna die. Tessa! Hey... Oh! - Oh, my God! Sorry. - Whoa, whoa! My legs are always Jell-O after races. I can't believe that you're a... A jock? A jock, yeah! Jocks don't speak Spanish, French and Italian. - Hey, this one does. - Well, they definitely don't read Jane Austin and Emily Brontë. - I have a thing for happy endings. - Skylar! Oh, shit. Here we go. Um... That is what I call a finish. Thanks, Mom. - Um... - Movie theater girl. - Her name is Tessa. - How did you... The blue eyes. Skylar went on and on about them. Wow, Mom! Does anyone see a deep, dark hole I can crawl into? You know, he spent weeks searching for you on the Internet. - Mom... - And he couldn't find a thing about you. Well, that is by design. Told you. She's analog. Like me. Your father is driving me crazy. Talk to him, Mom. Tell him... Tell him I won. No. You can talk to him yourself later. Are you going to be heading back to Edison tonight? No, I'm gonna be staying at Grandpa Mike's. Um... But first, I was gonna see if Tessa maybe wanted to go... Chill out and hang? Oh, my God. Movie theater girl would love to chill out and hang. - All right. Bye. - Thanks. Thank you, Mom. That's my mom. She does, uh, parties. I can put the top up if you want. No, it's okay. It feels really good. You look amazing. Say it in French. You too. Um... You don't have a girlfriend, do you? No. Not since the eighth grade. Why? This kinda looks like you. No. That is, uh... - That's my mom and dad when they were teenagers. - Oh! Yeah, this is actually the same Jeep that my grandpa bought my mom for her 18th birthday. You can actually see it behind them in the photo. Oh, yeah! They're so cute. They look so in love. - Yeah, they were. - "They were"? Are. They are. My dad's just living and teaching in Oregon right now. That's pretty far. Are they, like, taking a break or something? No. They're gonna be fine. They talk almost every day, so... Some music. - Whoa! - If you wanna take a look. What? Yeah, it's my mom's entire high school playlist. New Order. Cake. Bush. Echo and the Bunnymen. Your mom's like my new bestie. Your dad made her a mix tape? Yes, he did. Can I play it? It's the other way. - It's okay. I won't tell the '80s police. - Shut up. I have spent every summer of my life down here with my grandfather. How have I never heard of this place? Well, that's my favorite part about taking photos. It's like you just stumble and wander and find places like this. Right. But what... what drew you to this spot specifically? The view. That view. It was called The Empyrean. It was a honeymooners' resort back in the '60s. It's so surreal. It's unbelievable. You've gone in there? Unarmed? I'll do anything for a great photo. "Empyrean"? That's where Dante meets God, right? Highest of all heavens. A place of pure love. Look at it. If that's not a metaphor for love, then I don't know what is. Can I see your photos? They're not on my phone. I don't shoot digital, remember? Well, how do people see your work? I don't show it, unless I have to for class. How come? 'Cause I'm not good enough yet. I find that seriously difficult to believe. Okay, so if you won't show me your photos, - maybe you can give me a tour. - Of The Empyrean? Yeah, show it to me. I wanna see it, you know, through your eyes. Do you know how to waltz? - No. - Okay, just step back this way. - Okay. - And then your back foot forward. And then it's like one, two, three. Straighten your leg. One, two, three. Okay. And then you have to put your chin up and then lead. Like you don't want to pay any attention to the other person. Don't slip. Do you want to see what it's like to be inside of a camera? - Yeah. - Okay. Close the door. It works just like a camera lens. I kind of made it myself. Whoa. It's beautiful. Yeah. I mean, it's pretty good, right? Ooh, I mean, it's obvious you just haven't been playing that long. - Just three years. - Oh. Should have heard me back then. Can you hear them? Hear who? The ghosts of newlyweds past. No. What are they saying? Well, the groom, he's saying... Come on, honey. You've been in the bathroom for two hours now. It's time to come to bed. You're my wife. What does the bride say? Well, the bride is saying, um... But you haven't even kissed me yet. - Okay. - You want me to walk you to your door so your parents don't think I'm a... taxidermist? What? Or like someone... a serial killer? That's okay. Um, they're not my parents, actually. I, uh... I'm just a genetic stranger that lives under their roof. "A genetic stranger"? Yeah, it's, uh... It's a long story. For another time. When can I see you again? Um, well, when are you back in Avalon? End of the month. And how long are you gonna be here for? The whole summer. I'm staying with my grandpa until I leave for Brown. You're going to Brown? What? I just kissed an Ivy League bro? Your street cred ruined? Only if you tell me that you're also a lifeguard. Yeah. - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. About three summers now at Washington Avenue Beach. No! Why? - Good night. - Good night. Do I need to kick this guy's ass? No, she's just scared. Why? Because she likes him. Tessa? Shannon's waiting. Okay, I'm coming. Hey, what's that? That is four A's, one A-minus. Don't want to talk about it. I'm gonna tint the windows, so no one knows it's me inside. Geez, stop whining. It's a car. So did you call the phone company? - Yeah. - And? You were right. They just said that Skylar probably sent the photo before the accident and then it got stuck in the server or something. But that doesn't explain why my phone just turned on after it was completely trashed. Can you explain that? I can't. No. Hey. It's totally normal to read into things. My mom did the same thing after her sister died. Every rainbow was a sign. Every butterfly was a message from heaven. Meet my computer on wheels. Shit. Sorry. You put it on my Spotify. It's okay. Hey. Talk to me, Tess. I can't believe he's gone. It's like I close my eyes and I see us meeting for the first time. And I remember every word that he said to me. I remember every expression on his face. And then I open my eyes and it's like... Did I, like, just dream our entire relationship up? - Did I dream him up? - Hey. I was there. He wasn't a dream, okay? Your head's just a little scrambled. That happens when two tons of metal comes crashing into you. I don't even remember the last thing I said to him. - Come on. - I'm serious. We were fighting that last week, remember? Hey. You guys had an epic summer. - One that you will never forget. - Yeah. Damn, I won't forget it, and I was just a jealous bystander. Oh, my God. It's my first day back, and I look like a total mess. Yeah. You do. You do, yeah. I heard about what happened, Tessa. I'm terribly sorry. If you were my daughter, I'd tell you to use it. Use it? The pain, the emptiness. Channel it, through your camera. Some of the greatest works of art were produced by intense grief. - Okay. - Tessa. RISD portfolio day is right around the corner. Thank you. So that's it? You're just giving up your photography? It sure looks like it. This is the same crap your mom used to pull. She'd become obsessed with things. Baking, yoga, pottery. One day, lose interest, move on to the next. That's why she could never get any traction in life. Are you done? You think Skylar would have wanted this? I don't know. Why don't you go ask him? - It's okay. I won't tell the '80s police. - Shut up. I'm still here, Tess. Sky? - Tess? - I'm sleeping. I just did a double shift. You were asleep when I left. Did you even eat anything? I'm not hungry. Can you please just let me sleep? No. No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no... No, no, no. No, no... No. Hi. - Tessa? - Uh, I gotta talk to Doris. Hang on a second. Let me... Wait, Tessa. - What... - Her family took her home this morning. There was nothing more we could do. Are you okay, honey? Um, I just haven't... I haven't eaten today. - Um... - You know what, let me check you out. - Why do you need to talk to Doris so bad? - It's just... It's about what she was telling me before. It's about the afterlife. Maybe that old coot isn't so crazy after all. - What do you mean? - Your heartbeat is fast, but it sounds healthy. Wait, what do you... What were you saying? What do you mean? Doris told me you'd come looking for her. She even left you something. Her book. Tessa, I have seen a lot of dying and grieving in my time here. Looking back never helped anyone. There's either life or there's death. There's no place in-between. I'm gonna find him. What does the in-between look like? Well, we as living beings can never imagine it. We have no reference. It would be like trying to describe a sunset to a blind man. Technological advances have made ghost-hunting a legitimate field. My friend Darlene, she let me borrow her full-spectrum digital camera. This baby can pick up light well beyond the human eye, with infrared night vision... Well, happy Fourth of July. - I don't know. I actually kind of like this weather. - Don't call me. So, you think this means the fireworks are canceled? - I think so, yeah. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. Skylar, Tess says you're going to Brown. - Congrats! - Thank you. What are you gonna study? - Probably Latin. - That'll come in handy. You never know when you're gonna meet the Pope or something. Or need to conduct an exorcism. Nice. That's nice. I don't know. I just don't want to have any regrets, you know? I wanna live a bunch of different lives. What's the point of speaking all these languages if I'm not gonna travel the world and use them, you know? Let's go. We are going to watch the fireworks on TV. Are your parents home? Do you want to talk about it? Not really. Okay. My mom filed for divorce today. I'm really sorry. You know, I know this doesn't help right now, but... just because they're splitting up that doesn't mean that they don't care about each other. It means they've given up. - I don't think that's fair. - Fair to who? You or them? When you're rowing a race and you get to the last 20 meters, your entire body is telling you to stop. Your muscles are on fire. Your lungs are screaming at you. Everything inside you wants to quit, make the pain go away. But if you want to win, that's exactly when you dig deeper and you row harder. You really don't like to let things go, do you? You noticed? You're just starting to make me believe in happy endings. - Oh, no! The photo! No. - Oh, oh... - What? - It's totally ruined. It's totally ruined. Now you see why I don't let anyone up here. I am pretty amazed that you've let me into your inner sanctum. Yeah, well, if you tell anyone, I'll poison you. Oh, you don't have to... - Hmm? - You don't have to look through that. - No, no, no. Okay. - Yeah. It's cool. I like this one. - That's, um... - That's a cell phone tower. - Yeah. - It's an allegory for something... technology co-opting our natural environment. Really? Really. I know you hate compliments, but this work is incredible. I'm serious. It's like you can see things that no one else can. That just shows how much you know about photography. I mean, I think you can sell this stuff. Maybe on Etsy. There is something that's missing from like all of your photos. Yeah, I know. It's color. No. You. I just don't really think the world needs another selfie. Oh, come on. What is wrong with stepping in front of the camera every once in awhile. I believe that a photographer should point her lens outward, - toward the world. - Yeah? Yeah, so you can try and understand it. What about trying to understand yourself? If you had my past, you wouldn't ask that question. You ever gonna tell me about it? Come on. I'll walk you home. I never met my real father. He ran off before I was born. And my mom... The kind way to describe her would be flaky. - Wow. - Instead of counting sheep to go to sleep when I was a kid, I would count her fiancés. And Mel was one of them? Yeah, he was the last one. Her final victim before she ghosted us for good. And that's when he took you in? Well, he tried, but the court, they just didn't really look too kindly on a middle-aged bachelor wanting to adopt a young girl. So then where did you go? Ah, Family Services. Foster care. Oh. You know how you said that I notice things that no one else does? Mm-hmm. When you live with strangers who can hurt you, and I bounced around a lot, you have to really just observe everything. When you're a foster kid, you learn the hard way to... Never put your guard down? Yeah. Anyway, about a year ago, Mel and Vickie got married and then the court let them take me in. So that's why you call yourself a genetic stranger? I did that. Good God. - How early is it? - Super early. A little splash of almond milk, right? Uh, yeah. I like your necklace. Yeah? Shannon lent it to me. You know, if you ever want to borrow anything from me, clothes or makeup, jewelry... All righty. I'll see you later, Vick. See ya. When a rower dies, this is what heaven looks like. For me, heaven is Paris in the rain. Like cobblestone streets. - Yeah? - Yeah. Is everything in black and white? Get out of my head. You ever been? To Paris? Someday. Avec moi? I guess I could use a translator. My parents had their honeymoon there. So I've been saving up to send them for their 25th anniversary. - What if they don't want to go? - I mean, who doesn't want to go to Paris? Yeah, but what if they don't want to go with each other? It's not a crime to fall out of love, you know. - Tessa. - Hmm? Love never dies. What? You just sound like someone who's never been hurt by life. You putting me on notice? No. Um, what the hell is that? This... - is a rowboat. - I'm assuming you want me to get in that? - You are getting in this with me. - No. We spent four hours in your dark room doing what you love to do. Let me show you what I love to do. - Hands under your... Thumbs there. - Thumbs here. And then it's gonna go simple like that. You press it down. - Okay. - And then you tilt it and then you pull it. - Hmm. - And then you're pressing down, tilt it, and then pull it. - Okay, I'm gonna try and go forward again. - All right. - Don't help me. - I won't. I won't. You've got this. You've got this. Oh, my God! This is awful. - Oh, I'm tired now. - You're flying! I love you, Tessa. We should probably head back, yeah? Hey. "The in-between"? That's just what Doris calls it, but every culture has its own version of it. So, it's where we go after we die. Not me. I'm going to Jamaica. I'm serious, Shannon. It's like a waiting room for our souls. Okay, so you think Skylar is reaching out to you from this waiting room? They were color photos, Shannon. I don't... I don't shoot in color. I don't even own the chemicals to develop it. - But you can't show me the photos? - No, I told you. The fixer didn't work. I don't know why. But maybe spirits can't be captured on film or something. I don't know. All right. Tess, I want to believe you, I swear, but messages from the other side? I just think he wants the same thing I want. To see me one last time so that we can actually say goodbye to each other. You loved him, and he knew that. What more is there to say? Two-minute warning. Please take your seats and set your phones to silent mode. Dude, we need to focus, okay? You're not even listening to me. Yes, I am! I just don't think this is about color photos or waiting rooms or the in-between. - Then what is it about? - A girl who won't let go. Just think about it. Okay? Sorry. Cell phone use is prohibited during the test! Didn't I tell you the drive would be worth it? This negative's made of glass. It's coated in collodion, then dipped in silver nitrate, which is crazy. Because after that, you only ave a few minutes to take the photo or the chemicals completely dry up. Hmm. That's exactly what I was gonna say. It's only ten grand. It's a little out of my budget. But I can offer you a gluten-free cracker - with rotting cheese on it. - You're so generous. it's crazy. Sorry. Am I interrupting? No. Julian, hi. - We were just talking about how much we love the photo. - Oh, yeah. It's wonderful, isn't it? I just love how he prioritizes mood and atmosphere over subject. That is a very sophisticated insight for a girl your age. Julian, meet my very sophisticated girlfriend. Hi, I'm Tessa. Nice to meet you. - Congratulations on this. This is great. - Oh, thank you. Okay, kids, follow me. I wanna show you something. Doesn't it look amazing all lit up like this? - Like it belongs here? - It does belong here. Tessa, you have an extraordinary eye. I don't understand. It's for sale for $1,000. Yeah, and we already have two serious inquiries. Uh, this photo is not for sale. This was a gift to Skylar. Can't you print another one? I really just don't want anyone looking at it. Can we please take it down? Are you serious? - Take it down. - Hey, it's okay. I'll take it down. Thank you. That's exactly why I brought you here, to prove that your photos are great, even Julian thinks so. I don't want this photo hanging on the wall of some random stranger. This is my photo. That means I get to decide who I share it with and I shared it with you. You're right. I'm sorry. I should have asked you first. I just wanted you to see how amazing you are. And that you can get into RISD. Who said anything about RISD? Shannon said your art teacher thought you could get in. - I'm gonna kill her. - It is the best art college in the country. And it's in Providence, which is in the same city as Brown. Which if you get in, we could be together. - I... - For real. Without a ticking clock. Even if I could get into RISD, which I totally doubt, - I cannot afford that. - You're going to get into RISD. - No. - And you could just get a scholarship. Skylar, Jesus, just give it up. This is... You can't fix everything. What? Your parents' marriage and me. Some things are just beyond repair. Is that why you won't say you love me? Because you're... beyond repair. Okay. That's... Hey, 8:00. I'm here like you asked. What's up? I would like to take your portrait. - Uh... can I change first? - No, you don't have to. You can just put that on. What's that? It was my mom's. This really brings me back to college. I had a boyfriend who was an art major. Made me pose for him. So... Mel isn't the first person that you've been in love with. Gosh, no. I've loved a few men. Maybe even one woman. Did you love any of them more than they loved you? Oh, probably. Didn't that scare you? Knowing that someone could you hurt you more than you could hurt them? Yeah. Maybe at first. But then I think I realized if you protect yourself from the lows, you just end up missing all the highs too. You love Skylar. Don't you? I think I'm screwing it up. Yeah. If it's not opening old wounds, it's probably not true love. I just don't know what to do. How do I get Skylar to understand that... I love him. You start by saying it. You need to hear the words, Tessa. You mean, he needs to hear the words. No. You need to hear yourself say them. Out loud. So the world knows your feelings count. That you count. Vickie, I'm sorry. For how I've treated you. Hey Google, dim the lights. - Yes! - Oh, man. No smoke machine? Shh! We begin this invocation by asking the Archangel Michael to protect us against any malevolent spirits - that may be seeking a gateway into this earthbound sphere. - You wrote this? - You're interrupting my invocation. - I'm sorry! It's just... This is crazy. Did you read all of these books in two days? Bitch, yes! You know speed reading is my super power. Enjoy Your Own Funeral. Yeah. That happens to be a classic of the paranormal metaphysical genre. - Now hush. - Okay. We seek to communicate only with the disembodies spirit formerly known as Skylar Adams. No other spirits, please. Okay. - A Ouija board? - Please, Tess. This is a planchette. There's a pencil tip attached to the bottom. We ask questions and Skylar communicates by moving our hands. Just like he did in the gym. Here. Fingers right there. Okay. Close your eyes. - Oh, my God, it moved. - Sorry that was me. My bad. It's called scrying. The deceased use the mirror as a gateway to the world of the living. All you have to do is stare into the mirror in a trance-like state. - That's it. - Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. Can we cover up Gambino and Drake? They're like really distracting me. Instrumental Trans-Communication. The spirit uses the TV monitor as a bridge to our world. - What is this? Okay. - Here you go. Blocks out the gamma rays. Do you see anything? No. Do you? No. Maybe I should have read more books. No. No, you've been awesome. Oh, man. It's just Vickie. Needs the car. She has a shift. Okay. I'll walk you out. Okay. Hello? Your route is being calculated. Proceed for four miles to the entrance to Highway 85 South. It's a map. Tessa? Tessa! Sorry! I've gotta do this. Tessa! Head southwest to I-95 South, and proceed for 106 miles. Continue straight for six miles. Take the next right, and in 100 feet, your destination will be on your right. You have arrived at your destination. I told you he wasn't gone yet. Doris! Come. Sit. You know, I love coming out here at night to watch the shooting stars. My angels are calling me home. Skylar knows the end is near. You don't have much time. He's been communicating with you? Well, I'm much closer to his world than you are. What does he want? My help. To bring the two of you together. Can you? Please. In ancient folklore, the souls of the departed returned to places where they experienced their greatest moments of love. That's where they were able to cross the life-death barrier. Now, perhaps if you and Skylar went back to where you felt the most love, the window between worlds might open? Okay. But be careful. If you do manage to cross the barrier... there may be no way back. Tess? What's up? This is not how I wanted my summer to go. Oh, no, what do you mean? What's wrong? They're so cute together, it's stupid. Who's cute? - Oh. Is that Judd? - That's Judd. - Oh... - My vagina is weeping. They are cute, but I'm so sorry. That's terrible. - Oh, my God! - What? Billy Hodges came to my party? Ciao, Billy. - Hey. - Hey. It's just three words. Hi. Can we go somewhere to talk for a second, alone? Sure. - Yo, brutha! - Hey. - I just heard the good news. - What news? - Um... - Oregon State! - Nothing's official yet. - Oh, bullshit, bro. No, I just talked to the new coach. He said it's as good as done. Come on. - Um... - Okay. Tess? Tess? Tessa? - Tess, I was gonna tell you, I swear. - When? - When were you gonna tell me? After I got into RISD? - No, of course not. - I just didn't want to give you another reason to back out. - What about our plan? The same city? No more ticking clock? You weren't even gonna send in an application. I applied last week. Well, thank you for waiting until the last possible moment to tell me. The truth is, Tess, my dad's not... He's not doing that well. He's really lonely in Oregon and I feel like I should stay with him for awhile. Oregon is on the other side of the country. - How were we ever gonna see each other? - It'll be hard. I'm not switching schools permanently. I'm not! And if you get into RISD, and you will, I'll be in Providence before you are. What happens if you start to like Oregon? What happens if your team starts to win? Tess, my dad needs me right now. He's my family. I don't... You don't understand about family because... Because I don't have one. That is not what I meant to say. I knew this was gonna happen. I get close to people and they disappear on me. This is just what happens to me. - Tess. - No. No. You're just gonna push me away like you do everyone? The summer is over, Skylar. And so are we. - Hey. - Your ghost-hunting assistant has arrived. Here you go. Direct from Daddy's closet. Yeah, this is full spectrum, motion sensor, night vision. Perfect. Thank you. Who gave you all the swag? Ah, Vickie's credit card. Whoa! Tessa's a bad, bad girl. - Bye. - Hey, if there are nudes of my mom on that camera, I do not want to know. Shh. I'm gonna tell you. Central, standby. You Tessa Benson? I can't believe you tracked my phone. The day you stole Vickie's credit card was the day you gave up your right to privacy. - What were you doing at the hotel so late? - I was taking photos. - I told you that. - What, are you trying to put yourself back in the hospital? I don't understand this. Things were so much better this summer. - We started to feel like a family. - Do you not understand? Geez, I wonder what happened at the end of the summer that might change my mood. - You know what I've been through? What Vickie's been through? - Stop. - Love hurts. You learn to live with it. - Fuck off, Mel. Hey, no! You don't get to talk to him like that. - Not after everything he's done for you. - There's no... Tessa! She's ruptured the repair. Is it any wonder? The way she's been running around all crazy. You can see right here. There's a fair amount of blood accumulated around her heart. - Will she be all right? - Not until we drain the chamber and reinforce the original suture. We're gonna schedule you for an OR first thing in the morning. No, no, I... I'm not... You gotta let me go. You need to let me go. - Tessa! 50 milligrams now. - Jasmine, no! Don't, please! Tessa, if I let you go home, you won't make it through the night. - You don't understand. You don't understand. - Get some rest now, honey. I never got to tell... tell him. Tell him what? That... They can never, ever tear us apart. Tess? Shan, is that you? Are you okay? You... You sound medicated. - I'm at the hospital. - What happened? I saw him, Shan. - No way. - At the hotel. I couldn't touch him, but he was there. I just have one place left that I have to go. - The lake. - Where he told you he loved you. I just don't really have much time left. Okay, stay put. I'm coming. Whoa. - Now what? - I don't know. - Room 22. - I'll take him. Oh. Ooh, two more. Witching hour. I'll take odds, - you take evens. - Yeah. - Whoa. - Let's go. I could get used to this. Hey! What are you doing? Go, go, go. Come on. Oh, God. Whoa. What the hell? The lake is that way. You've gotta turn around. - I know. I know! - It's the wrong way! Please turn around. I can't. - Let go. - What? Let go! I want a dead boyfriend too. - What are you doing here? - Skylar says he's called you and left you a ton of messages. - So? - So? You're ghosting your soul mate? Shannon, my past is always just gonna get in the way. Remember last year, you'd spotted that condemned bridge and just had to get a photo. You had to jump into the water, even though it was freezing cold. You know what I was thinking, when I saw you down there swimming against the current to get your photo, "Imagine if Tess could be like this for her life, and not just for her art." He's leaving tonight, Tess. Lock up for me. This is where the accident happened. Do you know why he brought you here? No. I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. Tess? Tess! Oh, my God. I need help! 911, what's your emergency? My friend just passed out. She has a heart condition. I'm at the corner of 6th and Channel, please send somebody! Skylar! Tess. You forgot your hat. I'm so sorry, Sky. I'm sorry. I'm... I should have talked to you before making any decisions. No. You shouldn't have to explain loving your family. If I hadn't spent my whole life just pushing everyone away, I would have understood that. - No, come on, Tess. - I love you. I said it. Would you mind if I said it again? I love you. Hey. - It's you. - It's me. Oh, my God. - I love you. - I know. You told me. I love you. So that's why you brought me here? So that I'd know? Yeah. No regrets. So, is this... Is this it? We're still in Avalon. Not exactly. It's like everything you see is a memory, a dream that we have, to project it onto the world. It's kinda cool. Come on. I'll show you. Okay. I came out here the first day I met you. My parents had just told me about the separation. Felt like it was the worst day of my life. And then I met you. And it was probably the best day of my life. Mine too. There's nothing more we can do. She has a decision to make. She has to want to live. Come back, Tess. Come back, Tess... Hey. What's wrong? I've spent my whole life learning how not to get hurt. And that's no way to live. But... But even with all the hurt that I feel right now... I don't regret a thing. Because I love you. And knowing that I'm capable of feeling this way, makes life worth living. I don't want to say goodbye. You don't have to. Love never dies. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. Go give us a happy ending, yeah? Hey. No more dying, okay? Oh, my God. It smells so good. - Sit down. There's plenty. - I can't. I gotta go. - Good luck, Tessa. - Love you. - Go get 'em. - All right, bye. See you later! Ever since I was a little girl, people always told me that I see things that no one else does. It wasn't just that my camera was a way for me to express myself. It was the means by which I captured the unseen. It was only recently that I discovered something that I had been blind to. A ghost. All of us, each and every one of us, are haunted by ghosts. The ghosts of childhood trauma. The ghosts of unfulfilled dreams. The ghosts of lost love. Like so many people, I believed that, if I just ignored these ghosts, they would eventually go away. This turned out to be a mistake. Just like all of our worst fears, these invisible spirits gain strength in darkness. If we run from them, they run faster. If we push them away, they just push back harder. What are we supposed to do? It has taken... great personal loss for me to discover the answer to this question. We must attend to our ghosts. We must welcome them into our lives as though they are part of us, because they are part of us. It's only when we acknowledge their presence will they make room for new possibilities. In the end, I've learned that our ghosts are part of who we are, part of who we hope to be. These hauntings stay inside us, tethered to our hearts forever. In life. In death. And... everywhere in-between.
