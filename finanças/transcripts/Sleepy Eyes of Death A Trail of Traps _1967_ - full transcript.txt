I almost... did it. Be kind! No way. If you want me, train harder! Oh! Welcome! Where have you been? I've been waiting for you. Damn! Hot saké? I don't want any. Oh...? Take off your clothes. In the day time? We can sleep anytime. Because... Bulls-eye! I look terrible. It's your fault. You want hot saké now? I guess so. - Hot saké please! - Yes! I hate you. Your face. You seem like you don't care about women. I see women as sexual objects. Oh my... I always wanted to ask you one thing. Who is your father? Why do you ask? The more I look at you, the more you look like a foreigner. What's the matter? You've just asked about something I never discuss. Wait! Are you Nemuri Kyoshiro? I'm asking you if you're Nemuri Kyoshiro. You don't have to ask. What? Ever since I left my place, the gentleman has been following me. Then, you're ready to fight. I don't think so. I have a lot of enemies who seek my life. Therefore tell me why you want to kill me, otherwise I can't fight. I will punish you for all the sins you've committed in your lifetime. That's a good reason. However, carrying out Tenchu (Heaven's Punishment) on me, a ronin, is something I just can't see. I guess you can't really tell me the reason you want to kill me. If that's all you've got... Punish me on Heaven's behalf some other day. Please wait! I must ask you a favor, as I see you are Nemuri Kyoshiro-sama. Nemuri-dono, please forgive my rudeness in the street before. My father must die unless you help him. I was assigned a secret mission as a magistrate of our government to deliver something very important to Kyoto. In order to carry out my mission in a safe manner, I really need your help, Nemuri-dono. Please stop it. You told me in the street you were going to kill me for no personal reason. If you only wanted to test me, that's totally absurd! I'm not selling my skill as you seem to think I am. Please forgive me... Please! Then, please listen to my story... Look at this. This gift from Portugal was given to the leader of 1637's "Shimabara Affair", Amakusa Shiro for political reasons. Since then, our section of the government has taken care of it. However, the government decided to send this secret treasure to Sir Madenokogi, a Kyoto aristocrat. Since this is a totally secret decision of our government, nobody should know. However, a group called "Kuroyubi-to" (Black Fingers) found out about it. Kuroyubi-to..? Yes. When I led a major arrest of secret Christians, some 30 people escaped. They went underground and formed the "Black Fingers Group". I've heard that they swear to their god that they'll kill me for revenge and steal this secret treasure. In order to oppose them, I can't think of anyone else but you, Nemuri-dono. Please help me! My answer is no. Personally, I have a small reason to hate Christians. But I can't imagine that I'd use my sword skill to protect this Santa Maria statue. Nemuri-dono! There's 5 days until we leave. Please change your mind before then! Please forgive us! Ever since my father got this order from the government, his character has been completely changed by the stress. My father would never be so rude to you if he was in his normal state. He used to be so kind to me and my mother. But recently he's changed completely, into a violent man. Nemuri-sama... Please help us! No thank you. There's nobody here but me and the tombstones. You're wasting your beautiful voice with nobody to listen. Hey, who gave you permission to be a singer around here? Nobody did... Nobody? Hey! You little bitch! Don't mess up our territory with your awful squeaky voice! It's shameful for us to get pity from our customers! Don't you know that! Please stop! I'll break both your thumbs... so you can never play the shamisen in your life! - I see your jealousy in action. - What did you say? I usually feel pity for ugly women when they show jealousy... toward beautiful women. But you're out of control... and showing your ugliness in a pitiful way. Please stay out of our business. We have our rules as singers. I can't do that. As men, we tend to take a beautiful woman's side. You're the ones who have to be punished because of your ugliness. Oh. Excuse me! Are you Nemuri Kyoshiro-sama? Oh! You are Kyoshiro-sama. I'm so glad! You're glad? After three days in Edo... I finally found you. How did you know I'm Kyoshiro? You're exactly like your sister. I have a sister? I just can't believe that. I understand. According to your sister, when your mother left to become a Christian she cut off all relations with her family. I've nothing to do with my mother. How can I feel for a sister? Please don't say that, and go to Kyoto to see her. I was an orphan, and your sister Tsuru-san took care of me until now. Otsuru? Your sister's name. Otsuru-san became ill about six months ago at the women's temple at Sawa. Ever since then, she keeps saying she wants to see you once before she dies. I thought now was the time to repay her kindness. So, without telling her, I came to Edo to find you. Do you expect me to say "Thank you"..? You traveled a long way. But it was a waste of your time. Kyoshiro-sama! Please see Otsuru-san once! Kyoshiro-sama! I try to avoid anything to do with my relatives. Perhaps I hate to have relationships with family. I could swear I cut him. Giabo (Greatest God of Hell), please listen to us once! Our souls are yours once our wishes come true. Give us your great strength and power to kill Asahina Shurinosuke and take the secret treasure statue of Maria. How could you come back here after losing your pinky, which is our religious symbol? Asahina will be using Nemuri Kyoshiro as his bodyguard. However, we must accomplish our mission, as we are the Kuroyubi-to (Black Finger group)! Greatest God of Hell, please listen to us once! "Greatest God of Hell, "please listen to us once!" This is the Black Finger group... They must have found out about you. Nemuri-dono. I'll ask you once again. Would you please help us? After I've successfully delivered the statue of Maria to Kyoto, I'll give you anything you want. Money, women... just tell me. Anything. You said money, women, anything I want... - Do you have anything in mind? - Yes. This young lady... Chisa? Do you want to marry Chisa? No... I've decided that I'll not have a wife in this lifetime. Therefore, I just want to have her virginity. I guess our contract has failed then. No. Please wait.! Well... What are you going to do? I accept. My duty comes first. Please help me. Nemuri-sama! Nemuri-sama...! I'm Chisa's mother, Sonoe. Please forgive me... for talking to you outside like this, but I'm desperate to ask you a favor. So please forgive me! Nemuri-sama. Please protect Chisa! I feel sorry for you, but you're asking the wrong man. I'm a man your daughter should be on guard against. Why is that? Asahina-dono promised that if I worked for him... I would have Chisa-dono's virginity. How awful! How could you do this? Why not? You're my wife... A delivery man brought this for you. "NEMURI-SAMA" "SONOE" "KUROYUBI-TO WAS HERE NEMURI KYOSHIRO" You're really Nemuri Kyoshiro. You're brave enough to accept our invitation. Are you the leader? I'm Saegusa Ukon. Do you accept the baptism of Giabo..? What is Giabo..? Neither Buddha nor the Christ compares to our almighty god! People will find him in the dark sides of their souls. There is no Buddha or Christ! Therefore, I don't believe in your God of Hell! Shut up! You will sacrifice yourself to our god soon. And you're not the only one. Look! Why do you want to sacrifice her? It's your fault. She's going to be punished for asking you to go to Kyoto. And for accepting Asahina's request, it will soon be the same for you! Anybody who tries to stop us must die. My god, I'll sacrifice them to you. Please make our wish come true... I'm asking all of you! Do you really believe what he says? Our souls are given to the Greatest God of Hell! Are you going to die for this god? Of course! He is the one who created us. It depends on him whether we live or not! Our flesh and blood will be his and Ukon-sama's. How stupid! God didn't make Man. Man created God! Go... Death is waiting for the people who disregard or betray our god. You have foreigner's blood in your body. If so, then what? I can see exactly what kind of life you've been through. You're betraying yourself in order to believe in your god! Shut up! I believe in my god and I want to be his child. Besides, I have 30 other members to follow me. I don't see it that way! I want to see what your fate will be. You don't have much time. When this candle reaches its end, you'll be blown up with this den in an explosion. You'll be blown to bits and fade unknown to others from this world. Kyoto... Kyoto... the women's temple in Sawa. Otsuru-san... is your... ..sister... - I'm sorry it's cold saké. - Yes. I drew your fortune when I went to a temple yesterday. I suppose you drew "illness". Yes. How did you know? I was born into this world with an "illness" lot. "People won't come" "Contracts will fail" "Bad time for travels." Well then I'll go. You'll go? Yes. - I said, "Bad time for travel"! - That's why I'm going. Where? Kyoto. I have to see some things for myself. - Then I'll go with you. - No, thanks. It's alright. I'll go by myself. "ASAHINA" Kyoshiro is a few hours behind them! Very well..! Wait! What a terrible thing! - This is not the work of bandits.. - Right. - They left that money on the road. - Ahh. Hey! Go back! Go! The decoys were killed. We never know where they're hiding. Yes. Kyoshiro! We'll pursue our mission until every one of us is dead. Don't forget that! Did my mother give a reason for committing suicide... in the letter she sent you before she died? What are you thinking? Nothing really. Was that your father's idea to let you carry the statue of Maria? No... - I insisted that I wanted to do it. - Why? Because of my mother's death, I felt depressed at home. Weren't you afraid of this? No, Kyoshiro-sama because you're here. How about it, Kyoshiro-sama? You said before that you didn't want to help us. You don't have to ask about my reasons. Kyoshiro-sama, since when have you become such a person? Since I killed my first victim. Was he a bad person who deserved to be killed? I've forgotten. You must go. If I need you, I'll come by. You must pretend I'm a total stranger when you see me. Go. If they were decoys, then who is carrying the statue of Maria? - Maybe Kyoshiro. - He isn't. But, if we keep following him, we'll surely find it. He's stronger than I thought. Don't be afraid of him! Kyoshiro also has a weakness. I'll get him before he gets to Kyoto. To complete our mission, we must kill Kyoshiro. "Please buy my mother" Unbelievable! To sell his own mother! How absurd. Does he think somebody will buy his mother? I'll buy her. Where are we going? Oh, you can't talk. Yes, take me there. Are you the one who is for sale? Yes. How much to buy you? I don't want to be paid with money. Then with what? I'm saved at last! I've been waiting for a person like you for almost three years. Today, my wish has finally come true. I want you to kill one samurai. He is my husband's sworn enemy. No thank you. I like to sleep with women, but not enough to kill somebody. Please... Help this pitiful woman! I don't care how long you've been waiting. I'm not that stupid, to put my life at risk for a stranger. Wait a moment, please! My enemy is a member of the evil Black Finger group. Onuma Iori is his name! To tell the truth. I'm Onuma's wife. Are you saying you want me to kill your husband? Yes. Onuma killed my ex-husband in order to take me. To get my revenge, I became like the living dead waiting for the day I can kill him. Onuma is an expert in spear combat. I'm a woman. After three years, I couldn't do anything until now. However, my miserable days are over. Please! Kill Onuma! If you don't do it, my chance to kill him will be lost forever. Please! You don't mind selling your body for your revenge? I've abandoned my body for three years now. If my wish may come true, I don't mind. Please lie down there. As I am a scoundrel, I don't care where I take my women. Why do you close your eyes? Open your eyes and look at me. How could you be so mean? You became so stiff, as if you're a virgin. See. You're shaking. Grieve! The more you grieve, the more excited it makes me! As you wished, I've killed Onuma Iori. Bastard! "My soul is for revenge." You're a model wife. Wait! - Please come in. - Please come on in. - Welcome. Please. - Thank you very much. Please come this way. Please, have a seat. Excuse me. Your friend has arrived. My friend? It's me! Thank you very much. I got you! How did you find me? A very handsome man in a black kimono. You're a walking advertisement. Can't you say "Thank you for coming?" I told you not to follow me. I said I'd follow you. You shouldn't do that. Have you ever fallen in love with a woman? - Yes. - What happened to her? She's dead. Really? All the women who have gotten involved with me are dead. And perhaps more will die. I don't care about the future. If I'm happy now, fine. Welcome. I hope you like it. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. How clumsy I am. You're not clumsy at all. What excellent skill you have! Being treated with poison tea is not my favorite thing. By the way, can I see your black fingers? Damn you! Oh, Samurai-san! This is a very good hot spring. Why don't you have a bath here? "POISON HOT SPRING KEEP OUT!" Samurai-san... Please listen to me... Until I've told my story to someone, I can't die... If you find me suitable, I'll listen to you. I was obsessed with making loaded dice for gambling, and finally was able to make a pair that rolled numbers in order. But, damn it...! Hanjiro... He stabbed... me suddenly... and stole them... I can't... die yet. Samurai-san... The story isn't finished. I told him the wrong order of the numbers. Even, Odd, Even. The numbers are correct until here, but I told him Odd... would be next. But the truth is... Even... will be next. Oh, Samurai-san... The proper... sequence is... Even... Odd... Even... Even. That is... now... correct... The last person in the world he saw was me. What an unlucky man he was. Please, take this. Hey wait, Hanji-san! Don't worry. It's not loaded dice. But this is only 5 ryo. What did you say? Since the game will be a big one, I have to say at least 10 ryo. Damn! You're being smart. Well, let's get started on our usual big game! Tonight's special is this! She's Chinami, a popular prostitute at my brothel. By the way, she tried to escape 3 days ago without paying off her 100 ryo debt. I guess she did it on account of her boyfriend. Now, I have no intention of putting her back in my house. At the same time, I need the money I loaned her. That's why I brought her to this big game. If you like her, please bet a lot! Winning a live woman and money will be excellent entertainment. Samurai are welcome here, aren't they? Of course! Hey! 10 ryo! Please put in 10 ryo each! - 10 ryo! - 10 ryo! - 10 ryo! Sixteen guests. 160 ryo all together! This game will be a tournament. The final winner will take Chinami and 160 ryo! Prizes in both hands! Go! - Place your bet! - Even! - Even! - Odd! - Even! - Odd! - Even! - Odd! - Odd! Game... 4 and 6. The winner is Even..! Please stay, those 8 guests that chose "Even". Well, let the next game begin! Odd! Odd... - Even! - Even! - Odd! - Even! - Odd! - Even! - Game! 5, 2.... Odd..! Next! - Go! - Even! - Odd! - Odd! Game! The winner is... Even! Well, both of you. Are you ready? - Go! - Yes. Odd! Even. Game! 5, 3... Even!! Samurai-san! Congratulations! But... What are you going to do with the woman? Dear! Dear! - I lost the game. - Wait! What about me? - Can't do anything. - No! No! Hanjiro! - Are you her boyfriend? - Yes... Idiot! I could kill you right now! But because your father was my friend, I'll let you go! I'm so sorry! Dear..! Oh, my dear...! Well, I'll take her with me. Dear...! Please, no...! Are you really in love with Hanjiro? Even if he's a schemer, or a murderer? When you've killed someone, you're more likely to kill again. Dear! Dear..! Now! Kill me! Kill me right now! You can't kill or gamble with one arm... But you can make love to your woman. KYOTO 28 Ri (about 55 Miles) You did it. "People will come". Chisa will become a woman again in three days. Where will you deliver it to in Kyoto? To Madenokoji-sama's kimono merchant Yuzen Don-ya, at his factory. - His factory? - Yes. There'll be too many people at the store. When I get to Kyoto, I'll dump these clothes and put my hair up again as a woman. Well. On the way back to Edo, are we traveling together? Once I've made sure you've gotten to Kyoto, I'll disappear. You should stay away from me soon. The sooner the better. Then... What about the promise you made to my father? Promises, friendship. I try to avoid those people's business things. But now... I'm feeling a little odd. Perhaps the moon is too beautiful. As the only person in my life, I don't want you to be unhappy. Happy, or unhappy, that will be my choice. How cold you are! Wait! You're so mean! I love you. I love you... That face of yours. What are you thinking? Tomorrow, I'll be in Kyoto. Please go back to Edo with me. You'll be killed when you get to Kyoto. The Black Finger group will be dead serious. Since the attack at the tea house by the pass, I've known who you are. Now that I see your face I'm sure of it! You're one of the Black Fingers. Will you kill me? I guess I can't escape. Kill me quickly! I'm holding you. I don't care if you're in the Black Finger group or not. Please go back! Who cares about the statue of Maria! I'm going to Kyoto to find out what's in people's hearts. Are you really going? Yes. Fool..! You fool...! You fool... Our deep condolences. To be sure, this is not something we did. This was done... by the Black Finger group, who kill those that break their rules. There's one more thing we have to say sorry to you for. You don't have any sister at all. I already knew that. Then why did you come to Kyoto? To check on it with my own eyes. What a brave man you are. Welcoming me with guns... instead of crystal rosaries. How very bizarre. Oh! Father...! Chisa, thank you for coming. Father, when did you get here? Yesterday. I left two days after you. I guess I passed you around the town of Ishige. This is Tomeya-dono. I'm Chisa. Thank you very much for your efforts. How brave a young lady you are to come all the way here. - Well... Let's see. - Yes. Thank you. I see... How do you like it? What a thing of beauty. I didn't expect such high quality as this. I, Asahina Shurinosuke, never lie. Thank you very much. But, Asahina-dono, you must be very happy to have 30,000 ryo in your hand. Well, I guess so. Father. Well... I thought we were going to contribute it. Don't be silly. Why should we waste it gathering dust when we can turn it into 30,000 ryo? What are you doing? Father, you betrayed Kyoshiro-sama and me! You must betray your own people first when you want to betray an enemy. Do you know how many people were killed since we left Edo? That's not my concern! - Give me that! - No! I don't want to give this to anyone anymore! That's enough! Master! Master..! Please listen to our young lady! Shut up! Master! Please stop it! Father. Are you really my father? No, you're not my father. You finally figured it out. Shurinosuke and I were twin brothers. But our parents favored Shurinosuke and were very cold to me. When I fell in love with your mother, they didn't let me marry her. Instead, Shurinosuke married her. I ran away from home in rage... and hated my parents and Shurinosuke. For 18 years I was wandering around the country, then came back to Edo six months ago. And I became Shurinosuke. Then, where is my father? I killed him with my own hands. Nobody could tell. But Sonoe found out one night. A thing that is only shared among a couple. Don't move! Those nuns have the skill to shoot an egg from 5 ken (15 feet). Thanks to you, the statue of Maria has been delivered safely. Tomoe-dono, why don't you thank him? You're no longer needed. You'll be sent to hell by two nuns. That's so perfect for Nemuri Kyoshiro! That smile on your face. Is that because you're being cynical about your life? I'm feeling pity for the father who has killed his only daughter with his own hands. Ridiculous! Where is anyone who could kill their own child? You don't know anything! You're the one who doesn't know anything! Listen to me. Eighteen years ago, just before you ran away from home... you raped Sonoe-dono. That's how Sonoe got pregnant with Chisa. - That's a lie! - It's true! It's clearly written in Sonoe-dono's will. Sonoe-dono confessed it all to Surinosuke on their wedding night. Surinosuke-dono was crushed with his misfortune and anger. But he didn't want to hurt Sonoe-dono's feelings. So he decided to put everything behind him, and raise Chisa as his own child. I usually don't care about human affairs. But I can't forgive you. Shoot! Kyoshiro-sama! Chisa-dono! It's Kyoshiro, Chisa-dono! I kept my promise. See, I'm holding you very tight. Ukon! Come out! For the first time in his life, Nemuri Kyoshiro challenges! It's too beautiful a place to shed blood. I'll accept your challenge! Ready! Can you defeat our combat soldiers? Look at the corpses of men who believed in god's help. Do you still say your god exists? - Yes! He does! - No! Born without a wish into this world, a life with cold wind and isolation. You've been hiding behind your god all your life. That was fine until now. But when you manipulated people's weaknesses using your god's name, for your own benefit, you went too far! Therefore I can't let you live, Saegusa Ukon! Shut up! How about you? Obsessed by an evil sword. God will determine who is right! I'll send you to hell with my own hand. That's all I can do for you, as we share the same sad fate. Enough talk! Take a good look at my Full Moon Style... as a gift to take along to your god. It's too cruel... My young lady... My young lady! It is, the only path... a child born under an unlucky star can follow. Perhaps this funeral is the right way to send Chisa to heaven. THE END
