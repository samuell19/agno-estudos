[DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [TRAFFIC BUSTLING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MELLOW MUSIC] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Bang! [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Hey, boys, I shot you! Why didn't you die? Ah, pipe down! What time is it? [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [TRAIN RATTLING] - Hello, Ms. Kellerson. - JEAN: Hello, Tommy. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hi, mom. - Hey, what time is it? - BUTCH: 4 o'clock. - 94 degrees. - Did I win? Oh, yeah? Who says you win? Wait a minute. "Dave Harris, 91. Paul, 93. Butch, 95. Tommy, 94." See. What'd I tell you? I win. Come on, pay me. What are you gonna buy? I'm gonna save up and buy me a horse. A horse? Where you gonna keep it? In the bath tub? Gonna keep it on our ranch. Since when do you got a ranch? - Since a while ago. - Where is it? - Way out West. - Whereabouts out West? Texas. Wherever Tombstone is. Anyway, it's near Tombstone. Ah, what are you talking about? You haven't got a ranch. You know, it's not really mine. It's my dad's. If your dad's got a ranch, what are you doing living here? Well, uh... As soon as they shoot all the Indians, we're gonna move. How long does it take to shoot Indians? TOMMY: Oh, I don't know. Maybe a couple of days. You mean, you're gonna move in a couple of days? TOMMY: Sure. We may even go sooner, and shoot the Indians ourselves. That's why I wanna buy me a horse. - Hey, where are you going? - I know how to shoot Indians. Indians shoot with bows and arrows. Oh, they do not. They got guns and they ride horses. Oh, what are you giving us? You're just making it up. - No. Really. - Oh, shut up... [SIREN WAILING] [BELL RINGING] TOMMY: I was gone long today. And when I came to the corner, all these men were laying in the street. And then, a big truck came along and killed 'em all, except one. And he was abandoned. So, I took my gun and I shot him. All by myself. How many bandits did you kill today? Well, I didn't have to use too many bullets, pop. The heat killed most of 'em. Glad the heat's good for something. Sure doesn't make you feel like eating. Cold supper is all I can think of in this weather. TOMMY: I liked it, mom. Tasted kinda like chicken. It was chicken. Sure you don't want some more? No. I'll get some coffee and donuts, midnight. That's not good for you. Oughta eat something, pop. Can't work on an empty stomach. Ah, working nights is not so good for the appetite. I know a man that worked at night once. - He was a robber-- - Now, Tommy, that's enough. I think we've heard enough about robbers for one day. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, do you mind if we show the apartment now, Mr. Woodry? Show the apartment? What for? Well, since you're moving, I... I'd like to show as soon as-- Since when are we moving? Well, there must be some mistake, Mr. Johnson. - We're not moving. - Oh, yes, you are. I heard it from the couple of the tenants. Just this afternoon. And I brought these folks... I... I'm afraid there has been a mistake, Mr. Johnson. - We're awfully sorry. - I can't understand. I... ED: Tommy. At it again, huh? I didn't mean any harm, mom. - Honest, I didn't. - You never mean any harm. But like I've told you a hundred times, someday, you're gonna get us all into trouble. MARY: What'd you say? It was just some of the kids. We got to talkin'. And I guess, I said, we were moving out to a ranch. Tommy, how would they feel if they'd rent the apartment to those people and put us out on the street? TOMMY: I didn't think they'd believe me. You never think so. But, you see, they do. Why do you wanna tell stories like that? Gee, I don't know, pop. I'm sorry. If you don't stop, I'm gonna have to punish you. - You know that, don't you? - Yes, sir. Go to your room. MARY: Don't worry about it, Ed. You're gonna be late for work. [TRAIN RATTLING] [MELLOW MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Mom. Mom, you awake? What is it, Tommy? It's so hot. Can I go out and sleep on the fire escape? I suppose so. But be careful. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [JEAN GASPS] JEAN: Joe! [MAN GRUNTS] [THUDS] [THUDS] Why'd you have to bungle it like that? - Why didn't you fix his drink? - JEAN: I did, Joe. But I guess he saw me do it. See, if anyone is in the hallway. JEAN: I don't see anybody. JOE: Take a look out of the window. JEAN: Nobody there. JOE: Here's his identification papers. He's a mate on a ship. That's good. They disappear easy. - Mom. Mom. - What? I've got somethin' awful to tell you. - What is it? - I just saw a murder. A murder? Where? Upstairs. The Kellerson's. They just stabbed a man. - Oh, for goodness sakes. - Honest, mom-- Waking me up in the middle night like this. But, mom, I saw the whole-- If you don't stop it, I'm gonna have to take a hair brush to you. - Please, mom-- - Tommy. With all the stories you tell us, no wonder you have nightmares. - Nightmares? - Yes. Nightmares. You've had a bad dream. You're soaking wet. Now, go on and go back to bed. But, mom... And go to sleep like a good boy. [MELLOW MUSIC] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Better go up first and see if anyone's on the roof. It's alright. [INTENSE MUSIC] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] You stay here. [TRAIN RATTLING] Couldn't have been a nightmare. My pillow! [INTENSE MUSIC] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - Did you hide him? - Yeah. Suppose somebody finds him there? So, what? They'll never trace him to us. [INTENSE MUSIC] [TRAIN RATTLING] - Up already? - I couldn't sleep, mom. You know why I couldn't. MARY: Everybody has nightmares, Tommy. Only people don't go around saying they're real. Well, they get into a lot of trouble. Honest, mom. MARY: Oh, Tommy. We won't hear anymore about it now. If you didn't have a nightmare, then you're making up another story. Better watch what you say to your father, this morning. Remember, he isn't expecting... - Hello, dear. - Good morning. - Hi, Tom. - Good morning, pa. MARY: What kind of a night you had? Oh, it was a scorcher. I'll have your breakfast ready in just a minute. What's the matter with you? You don't look like you went to bed. Don't think he got very much sleep. - Pop? - Hmm? I've got something to tell you. Okay. Shoot! Something terrible happened last night. You know the Kellerson's upstairs? Yeah. I've seen 'em coming and going. Why? Well, they killed a man. Tommy. Wherever did you get that idea? Well, well, I just got out on the fire escape, pop. But it was so hot, I climbed up to the Kellerson's. That's how I saw 'em. Pop, you gotta believe me. Someone's gotta believe me. He had a nightmare last night, Ed, and he's all upset. It wasn't a nightmare. And I'm not making it up. I saw them. Tommy, the Kellerson's are nice people. - They never bother anybody. - They just act that way, mom. So you won't know anything about 'em. Tommy, how would you like it if someone went around saying your mom and I kill people? But they did. I watched them through the window. Listen, I remember once, years ago, I was about your age. And it was a hot night like last night. I dreamt the whole house was on fire. I woke up screaming and yelling my head off. And mother and dad came in and it... it took 'em quite a while to calm me down. And even after they talked to me, I still couldn't believe that there hadn't been a fire. They had to let me get up and look around. Now, do you see what I mean? You see how real dreams can be? Yes, pop. I've had dreams like that, too-- Well, now here, you can't expect me to go upstairs and ask the Kellerson's if they killed somebody, can you? No. Then, they'd run away. [SCOFFS] Come on, now. Sit down and have some breakfast. You'll feel better. I'm not hungry, pop. Not a bit. Well, maybe you'd better go in and rest a while. Till you feel like eating. Pop. If you see a thing with your own eyes, it can't be a dream, can it? You don't want me ever to be ashamed of you, do you? No, pop. Well, don't you see that might happen if you keep this up? People are going to say that Ed Woodry's son doesn't know the difference between what's real and what isn't. Well, they... they might even say that you're a... a liar. - But, pop-- - Look. Look, Tommy. I've got a lot of nice things planned for you when you grow up. And I want you to live up to them by being honest now. A father wants to be proud of his son, Tommy. Why, there's nothing that'd give me more pleasure than to be walking down the street someday and have somebody say, "There goes, there goes Tommy Woodry's father." But, if you, if you're gonna get all mixed up the way you're now, I... I don't know what we're gonna do. I'm sorry, pop. I'm very tired, Tommy, I'm... I'm gonna get some rest. I want you to stay in your room today and think over what I told you, very carefully. I'll talk you again before I go to work tonight. I don't know what's the matter with him. Tommy, you know your father has to work hard for us, don't you? TOMMY: Yes, mom. And... he can't work when he's upset. TOMMY: I know. Then why don't you try to help us by behaving yourself? TOMMY: Mom, pop don't want me to lie, does he? Of course, not. Well, if I'd say it wasn't true about the Kellerson's that it was all a lie... then, then, I'd be doing what pop doesn't want me to do. I'd be lying. If someone had really murdered somebody, like you say... then the police would know about it. That's their business, Tommy. That's right, mom. It is their business. Certainly. Now, I'll go call your pop before he goes to bed. And you can tell him that everything you said about the Kellerson's wasn't so. Oh, no, mom. Don't. 'Cause, then I'd be lying, and pop don't want me to lie. We're both too easy on you, Tommy. TOMMY: Don't get mad at me, mom. Now, you're going to stay in this room. And I mean, without your lunch or your dinner. Until you decide to give in and let your father and me have some peace. [DOOR SHUTS] [MELLOW MUSIC] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [CAT MEOWS] [MEOWS] [MELLOW MUSIC] TOMMY: Pardon me, sir. I want to report a murder I saw last night. MAN 1: Is that so? What's your name? TOMMY: Tommy Woodry. I went on a fire escape last night-- Hold on, not now, hold on. - What's your address? - 225, Hull Street. I went on a fire escape last night. Then... MAN 1: Just a minute, son. Just a minute. Now, you go down that hallway to a door marked "detectives". You go in there and tell them all about it. What do you want, boy? It's about a murder, sir. Who... who sent you in here? The man at the desk up front. I saw a man murdered last night. - What's your name? - Tommy Woodry. I was looking through the window-- - What's your address? - 225, Hull Street. Where did you see this man murdered? - Upstairs from where I live. - Go on. Mr. and Mrs. Kellerson did it, sir. It was the man they were stealing from. Oh, you know the people that did it? What are they like? Well, they don't look like murders. They don't? Son, did you ever have nightmares, bad dreams that scare you? Yes, sir. Lots of times. But not this time. This was real. Come, son, tell us what you saw. Well, I went out on my fire escape last night, and then I went to the one above me because it was cooler there. I fell asleep, and when I woke up, I looked through the window. The shade was up just a little bit, so I couldn't see everything. But there was a fight and then somebody took some scissors and they stabbed this man in the back. I thought you said you couldn't see everything. I couldn't, but-- Then how do you know they stabbed him? Well, I saw him when he fell on the floor, there was blood on his back and he was dead. Have you ever turned in any fire alarms? You know, just to get a little excitement stirred up? Oh, no, sir. Never. Did you tell your parents about this? Yes, sir. MAN 2: Why didn't they come and tell us about it? Speak up, son, why didn't they tell us about it? They didn't believe me. MAN 2: Why didn't they believe you? They... they think I'm always making things up. Oh, they do. Huh? And are you always making things up? Sometimes, but I'm not going to anymore. You know, son, it's a pretty serious thing to make something like this up, don't you? Oh, yes, sir, I know that. I'm not making it up. Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt anything to run over there and have a look around. Alright, where do they live, son? 225, Hull Street, on the fifth floor, right upstairs from where I live. Remember, this is not official. So don't go sticking your neck out. Get into their apartment on some pretext or other and see what you can find out. - Alright. - Go along, son. He'll see that you get home safely. - Oh, no, I can't go home. - Why not? Well, maybe they found out that I know, they'll kill me, too. Don't worry about that, son. Nobody's gonna kill you. Not with me along to take care of you. Oh, no, please. I'm afraid. Son, don't be afraid. Mr. Ross will take good care of you. Come on. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - I can't go in the front way. - Well, why not? Well, if you'll take me on back on fire escape-- Oh, oh, no, we're going right to your mother. I'm not going on any fire escape. Come on. Here it is, thanks a lot. Now, I think we better see if your mother's home. - Yes? - How you do, Mrs. Woodry? I'm bringing your boy back from the police station. Police station? Oh, it has nothing to get alarmed about. He had quite a wild story to tell us. We thought we better come over and see what it was all about. Tommy, you didn't tell them. Please don't pay any attention to him. - He's always making up stories. - Oh! If it isn't Indians, it's gangsters. And if it isn't gangsters, it's something else. Someone's always getting killed. Like a born storyteller, eh? MARY: I don't know what we're going to do with him. We nearly lost our apartment yesterday because of one of his tales. And now, the Kellerson's... They're really very nice people. TOMMY: I didn't make it up about the Kellerson's. I saw them! Be quiet. Haven't you done enough for one day? You know, if I were you, ma'am, I'd talk to his teacher. Yes, yes. Or maybe even a doctor. Well, we'll have to do something. Mean time, I'd certainly keep an eye on him. MARY: Yes, I will. I'll promise you that. Thank you for bringing him back. Not at all, goodbye. [FOOTSTEPS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] See who it is. Go on, don't act suspicious. Open the door. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Open it wide. - Good morning. - Hello. Sorry to bother you, ma'am. I'm Mr. Proctor. We're making an estimate on some repairs in the building. You mind if I looked over the apartment? I haven't had a chance to clea-- Oh, tell him to come in, there's plenty needs doing. Well, alright, but it's pretty messy. Please don't pay too much attention to it. - Thank you. Good morning. - Good morning. It's about time they got around to cleaning these places up. Yeah, I find most of the apartments in pretty bad shape. - Yeah. - Look at that fixture. It never worked since we've been here. The bed in there ain't been painted since the place was built. JOE: Pretty crummy, ain't it? The wallpaper's falling off the wall. I remember one time we tore the paper off, we found a couple of hundred dollar bills behind it. Confederate money. The roof's been leaking for a long time, it ruined a rug. Every time it rains, the water just pours in. I'll take a look at that when I get up on top. Any more rooms? There's another bedroom in there. [CLATTERS] I guess I can do it, folks. I think I've got everything. When'll you get around to fixing it? No, I don't know. That's hard to say. This is only an estimate. We'll turn in our bid, but I'm not even sure we'll get the job. If we do, we'll take care of that for you. Thank you very much. - Bye. - You're welcome. I was kind of scared, Joe. What for? He doesn't know anything. Anyway, I was scared. Please, mom. I don't care whether you like it or not, you're gonna apologize to them. I'm gonna teach you a lesson this time, young man. - Please, mom, no. - Come on. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Hello. - Excuse me, Mrs. Kellerson. Tommy has something he wants to say to you. Well, what is it? MARY: Tommy. JEAN: Anything wrong, Mrs. Woodry? He's been a very bad boy. He doesn't look like a bad boy. What did he do? Well, since he won't tell you, he's been making up stories about you and your husband. Terrible things. And I brought him up here to apologize. To try to teach him a lesson. Stories? What kind of stories, Tommy? MARY: Go ahead. Tell her what you said. No. Oh, never mind, Mrs. Woodry, don't be upset. I know how little boys are. He'll grow up. I certainly hope so. I don't know what we're going to do with him in the meantime though. Don't worry about him. How's your sister getting along? Oh, she's much better. Thank you. Oh, that's good. MARY: You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Humiliating me in front of her like that. I was going to let you go outside. But now you stay in your room all day. No, she knows. She knows that I saw 'em. - They'll kill me, too. - Tommy, stop it. And if you go out that window again, young man, you'll really be sorry. I... I won't, mom. It's no place for me to go. [FOOTSTEPS] JOE: You're getting excited about nothing. JEAN: But the kid knows something. JOE: What does he know? He didn't see us. Nobody did. How can you be sure, Joe? He might have been on the fire escape. I've seen him playing out there lots of time. It was late. He wouldn't be out there at that hour. But he must have told them something. Why would she want him to apologize? Alright. The only thing we can do is find out exactly what he knows. JEAN: But how? Well, we wait to catch him alone. - I'll have a talk with him. - Wait to catch him alone? What do you want me to do, go down there now with his mother and father there? No, of course not. Alright, we'll wait. I'll think of something. False alarm. Kid's mother says he's always making up stories. Got them in a jam yesterday. They almost lost their apartment. What about the Kellerson's? Perfectly ordinary pair. Went through the whole place. You see anything unusual? Not a thing. Oh, it's funny what imagination will do, though. I saw some stains on the floor. It turned out to be a place where the roof leaks. I suppose we're lucky we didn't make it official. - Yeah. - How did you get in? Said I was an estimator. Say, if any more kids turn up with stories, will you send Dorcy out with them? I don't know anything about interior decorating. Aren't you going to eat? I'm sorry, pop, I'm not hungry. Well, that's not good, son. Drink your milk, Tommy. Did you stay in your room all day? I don't wanna lie, pop. ED: Well, did you? No, pop. ED: Where did you go? I... I went to the police and told them about the Kellerson's. That's what I wanted to tell you. After, Ed. I didn't want to spoil your supper. Sneaked out of the room without my knowing about it. Police only brought him back again. Naturally, they wouldn't believe him. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Yes? This telegram was delivered to our apartment by mistake. I... I thought it might be important. MARY: Thank you, Mrs. Kellerson. [DOOR SHUTS] It's from Uncle Charlie, Ed. Helen's worse. I'll have to get over there right away. They'll need me. Take me with you, mom. I can't take you with me, Tommy. And Helen can't stand children around when she stays sick. Besides, I might have to stay all night. If I do, there wouldn't be room for you. - Then you can't go. - Why not? It's all a trick, the Kellerson's sent that telegram. - Oh, Tommy. - Mom, you got to listen to me. You've got to believe me. Tommy, why do you act up like this when you know how worried your mother is? Mom, you can't leave me alone. He must be sick, Ed. He must be. Acting like this, and not eating all day. - They'll kill me! - Tommy, Tommy. Now, look here. What makes you think that this telegram is a trick? I know it, they know mom's got a sick sister and they know you work nights. They want me to be left here alone. If we could prove to you that Uncle Charlie really sent this telegram, then would you stop all this nonsense about the Kellerson's and admit that you're wrong, would you? - Yes, pop. - Good. Then in some way we'll prove to you that the telegram is real. Suppose we go to the drugstore and call up Uncle Charlie? You can talk to him yourself. Ask him if he sent it. - How does that sound? - Okay, pop. Swell, come on. Tommy and I decided we better phone Uncle Charlie just to make sure he sent the telegram. Well, alright. I guess I should call him first anyway. [PHONE DIAL CLICKING] Hello, Charlie, this is Mary. Yeah, I got it. How... how is she? Well, I'm on my way over now, but listen, will you talk to Tommy, he has something he wants to ask you. Yeah, he's right here. Hello, Uncle Charlie. Well, did you really send that telegram to mom? Oh, nothing. I just wondered. Here she is. Hello, Charlie. Did you talk to him? - Yeah. - Did he send the telegram? Now are you satisfied? You going to let your mother go and not make any more trouble? He won't be afraid anymore, will you? - No, mom. - That's a good boy. It's still early, but I might as well get to work. I can ride away with you on the bus. Tommy's going to be a good boy now, Ed. He's going to behave himself. If you want your supper, the plate's in the oven. Thanks, mom. You'll stay in the house tonight, Tommy. You're not very well and I don't want to be worried about you. - While your mother's gone. - Okay, pop. You can get your own breakfast if I'm not back in the morning. - Can't you? - Yes, mom. Oh, Tommy. - See you in the morning. - Bye, pop. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [FOOTSTEPS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [INTENSE MUSIC] [MELLOW MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [DOORKNOB CLICKING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [DOOR CLOSES] ED: What are you up to? It's a good thing I decided to come back and see if you're alright. Otherwise, you'd be out in the streets again. I'm sorry, pop. I am, too, Tommy. You're forcing me to do something I dislike very much. If I didn't have to go to work, I'd stay here myself and see that you didn't get in any trouble. But I can't do that. So I'm going to see to it that you stay in this room. - Please, pop. Don't. - I wouldn't. Not if you give me any reason to believe that I could trust you. Take me to work with you, pop. I won't be in your way. Honest, I won't. Tommy, your mother and I are very worried about you. Tomorrow morning, first thing, we're going to take you to see a doctor. Find out what's the matter with you. I'll try and get off as soon as I can. But you're staying in this room until I come back. Goodnight, Tommy. [MELLOW MUSIC] [INTENSE MUSIC] Is he leaving? Better wait a while and make sure. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CLOCK TICKING] JOE: It's after two. We waited long enough. Where is the passkey? You go down the fire escape. Take this with you. [FOOTSTEPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [INTENSE MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hello, Tommy. Now, you'll be quiet if you don't want to get hurt. What's the matter with you, Tommy? Don't you like me? Have I ever done anything to you? What are you running around telling stories for? - They're not stories. - No. Or maybe if you told me what they were, I could explain. I don't want you thinking these terrible things. What is it you think I did? You know what you did. But I don't. I don't know what you're talking about. Now, come on, Tommy. Let's be fair. You can't accuse me of something and not tell me what it is. You... you killed somebody. Oh, come on, Tommy. You don't really believe that. I was out on a fire escape. I saw you. Oh? You sure you didn't imagine it? No, I saw everything. The scissors and the man! Well, then, Tommy, if you really believe that, I think there's only one thing we can do. Go to the police and tell them about it. You haven't been to the police already, have you? No. Alright, then, I'll tell you what we do. We'll go down to the police station, right now. I don't want you believing these things about me. We wanna be friends. Maybe the police will convince you, huh? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, uh, Jean, uh, Tommy and I are going down to police station. - JEAN: Police station? - JOE: Yeah. There's something we wanna get straightened out. But, Joe... Oh, you can come along with us. Come on, Tom. You know which way it is, Tommy? Yeah, I... I think it's up this way. Let's go. You know, I'll be glad when we get this all straightened out, won't you? I think we've gone far enough. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [CLATTERING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [TRAIN CHUGGING] [TRAIN BRAKES SQUEAL] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [TRAIN CHUGGING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [CAR APPROACHING] Very ashamed of you, Tommy.

[TOMMY GROANING] Help! Help, police! TOMMY: Help! Help, police! - Well, what's the trouble? - They're gonna kill me! He's one who's gonna get when we get home tonight, that's what the trouble. And you can holler at all the policemen you want to, young man, that won't save you. He even once turned in false alarm to keep me from giving him a shellacking. A good lickin' never hurt anybody, boy. My old man used to give me enough of 'em when I was a kid. Hey, still in all, I never thought of callin' the cops when he did. They killed a man last night! Honest, they did! JEAN: Oh, Tommy... I watched them through the window, I saw them kill him! Say, are you the kid who was down the station house this morning and claimed he saw a murder? Yeah! Yeah, that was me! What? You went and bothered them too? Oh, Tommy, that's the last straw. Oh, it wasn't so bad. Nobody paid any attention to him. Well, it was bad enough, and he's gonna get plenty when I get him home. Don't worry, son. Maybe it won't be too bad. They're not my mom and-- [ENGINE WHIRRING] [TOMMY GRUNTING] I've had enough of this! Get over here! Let me out! Let me... Can you beat it? After he's given us all that trouble, he's gone to sleep. Just like a kid. Mine do it all the time. Yeah. You better carry him, Joe, so he don't wake up. Yeah... Sure can wear themselves out. - Ain't it cute, though? - Yeah. [ENGINE WHIRRING] Tommy? Tommy! [TRAIN CHUGGING IN DISTANCE] What're we gonna do with him? We're gonna figure out a way for Tommy to have an accident. Oh, uh, pardon me, officer. Have you seen anything of a little boy about so high, he's nine years old, has dark hair and a light complexion. No, I haven't. How long has he been gone? Well, I don't know, I... I came home early from work tonight, because I've been worried about him. He's been acting kind of funny all day. When I got home, he was gone. He, uh... He left me this note. Said he was gonna run away from home. Well, I know better than that, but I... I can't imagine what's happened to him. Ah, kids do funny things. Don't worry about him. I'll call and get some help. We'll find him for you. Patrolman Delaine leaving his post to look for a missing boy. I'd like to have a radio car help me. Will you send it over to, uh... 225, Hull Street. 225, Hull Street. I'll meet them there. Yeah. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Put out the light. Joe, you can't do that! What's the matter? Plays out here all the time. Said so yourself. [INTENSE MUSIC] You're gonna be alright. Aren't you, Tommy? [MUSIC CONTINUES] - He's not here yet. - Was he here all alone? Yeah, his mother had to go over to her sister's tonight. Would you mind waiting here a minute? No, not at all. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Can't let you do it, Joe. [INTENSE MUSIC] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [BREATHING HEAVILY] I thought maybe I could find him upstairs. I'll bet I know where he is. On his way over to his mother. Let me have the boys take you over there. You'll probably run right into him. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] - Is he in here? - Yeah. There's no stairs past the third floor. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Help! Pop! Help! Pop! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [INTENSE MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [TOMMY SCREAMS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [JEAN SCREAMING] [JOE GROANS] Stay back! Leave me alone! Leave me alone, I said! [WOOD CREAKING] [JOE SCREAMS] [THUDDING] TOMMY: Help! Help! [TOMMY SCREAMING] [TOMMY SCREAMING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Police department. 237, Hull Street. 237, Hull Street. Report back. Charles. Stand aside. Stand aside, folks. [SIREN WAILING] Stand aside. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What's the trouble? Condemned building collapsed. - Anybody hurt? - One fellow was killed. There's still somebody up on the third floor. There's a kid trapped up in the rafters, they're trying to get him down. Tommy. Hold it, folks. Get back, here. I wouldn't get in the way if I were you. Come on, get back here. Stand back. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Come on, get back. MAN 3: Don't move, son. Hold as still as you can. We'll have some help in a minute. Don't let him see us. Come on, boys. Hurry it up! We don't have time to get a ladder in. But here's a net. I'll throw the light on it. Can you see it? You see it now? Look down there. Sit up very carefully. And do just as I tell you. Don't jar that beam. Easy, now. [WOOD CREAKS] Keep your eyes open. Keep your hands and feet close together. When I count three... jump! Are you ready? One. Two. Three! Jump! Hurry, jump! [MEN GRUNT] - Are you alright? - Sure, pop. Tommy, are you hurt? Stand back, please, and let them out. Wait a minute, pop. That man they just carried out was Mr. Kellerson. And... and his wife's trapped up here in the building, and if you still don't believe me, well, the man they killed up there is in a closet. Honest, pop! Maybe we better get down to headquarters and get this story straightened out. Move back, folks. Let 'em out. - Alright, break it up. - Move back, folks. Let 'em through. Alright, let 'em through. Break it up. Step back. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ENGINE WHIRRING] And that's all the truth. That was some jump, son. Yeah, but I know one thing. I'm never gonna be a fireman. I don't like jumpin' in those nets. I'm proud of you, Tommy. And from now on, I promise I'll believe you. I'm glad, pop. And from now on, I promise I'll never make up another story. That'll make us all happy. I'll bet when we get down to the station, a lot guys are going to point at me and say, "There goes Tommy Woodry's father." [ALL LAUGHING] [SIGHS] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
