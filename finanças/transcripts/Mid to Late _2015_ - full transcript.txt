(birds chirping) (ship horn blowing) - [Mom] Oh, you need the problems? Okay, are you on the main homepage? Okay, so you're gonna. See this thing over here? You need to click on the file that says Robinson. Mm-hmm. And you're just gonna um-- - [Grace] Dear Grace of the distant future, I'm sure there's a million other things you're doing, so I'll be quick for us. I guess we should be reminiscing about high school, the best years of our lives, right? Of course you're reading this in the back of the gallery, or maybe on your lunch break. In New York, away from all the sameness. Free. (baby crying) - Sh, sh. I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything you just said, what? Yeah. - [Grace] Mostly, I just wanna say that you're doing great. Keep it up. Now stop reading this, and get back to work. Then head off to 11 Madison Park with your handsome man. Love, You. (woman humming) (woman giggling) - [Mom] Are you scared? Are you sleepy, hmm? (baby gurgling) You are? - [Man On Radio] And so, as Nancy was saying, we've got quite a cold front coming through here tonight. It's gonna be pretty rough. So settle in. If you are going out, make sure to put on those galoshes, guys.

Maybe there's a notebook or a magic mailbox or some shit. - I hate to burst your bubble, but there will never be a magic mailbox. It's just not gonna happen. This is a story of our time, and I know that sounds grandiose or whatever, but it's true. Everybody fantasizes about going off the grid, cutting themselves off social media, but we don't do it because we're terrified and this character actually does it. And he communicates with his girlfriend that he didn't wanna leave. - Yeah, you told me, interesting. It sounds great out of your mouth, but I don't have to tell you how long it's been since I've seen a word from you. - Look, I wrote the novella. - [Garth] I know you did. - I can't help it if nobody, you know-- - You gotta put yourself out there, man. The few bookstores left in this country are all clamoring for you to do a five-year anniversary tour, how many authors can even say that about their first book? How many authors can say that about their first book? How many authors can say that about their first book? - 38. Give or take, is that? - I think you're right, yeah, I think that's the number. - We've got the check coming in for the movie rights. Right? - No. That, somebody got fired, that got killed. It's dead. Did Shelby not call you? I told her to call you and tell you that. Fucking Shelby. You can't keep living off those residuals forever, man. I'll be right back. Oh, you got this, right? Because I'm your agent, so I don't have any money. (birds chirping) - Hey, you about ready? - Hey, there's that piece of ass. - Piece of ass? Look at you talking dirty. - Shut up, you. (laughing) - Hey, tonight, you don't have any phone calls to make. Nothing to plan, all you have to do is focus on having a great time. Okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hi. (lips smacking) (hard breathing) - I gotta get a condom. - No, it's okay. - It'll just take a second. - Look at me, it's okay. - Okay, just a second. Just a second, just a second, okay? - Okay. (sighing) (cars passing) (dog barking) - No, I love jungle animals, but why Brazil? - Because it's exotic, and it's romantic. And they have the best food ever. - Well the food network makes everything look good. Next week it's gonna be Afghanistan. A bowl of dirty water and some poppy seeds. - Oh my God. - I've got a hunch you're really gonna enjoy this. - Hunch, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Wow. - I know. - What about Martha's Vineyard? - It's freezing up there. - Okay, well I already rented the car, and it's the only time my family's not gonna be up there sitting around drinking port. - No, I think Brazil is our choice. - Okay. - Just remember not to tell Grace, okay, not tonight. - Hey back there, secrets don't make friends. - Neither do you and Andrew. - I've always liked that jacket on you. - I know. Honestly, it was getting a little musty, so I thought I'd bust it out for the special occasion. - Well thanks, babe. - Wait, stop. - What? - Walking by the theater here, I just remembered we have five tickets to the show tonight. - The Gregg Starkk Show? - Yeah. - Are you serious? - Does this look serious? - Oh my God, this is amazing. This is the best, thank you. - Of course. - Thank you. - Absolutely. - Let's go. - Oh, well, you know, there's five, so we're waiting on one more. - Who? (cars passing) - I heard this is his best monologue since Starving in Poughkeepsie. - That wasn't bad. - Yeah, I know, I'm that cultured. - (laughs) Yes, you are, baby. - I know. - Kelly? Holy fuck, Kelly! - Who's that? - I don't know. - He knows you. - Yeah, he does. Oh, oh my God. Stop. - It's been forever. - He's very touchy. - The last time I saw you was at Give Peace a Chant. Yeah, how have you been, it's been so long. - Oh, oh, my God. - Oh. - Good to meet you, dude. - Totally, dude. - Yeah. - [Hipster] I'll see you, Kel. - Okay. Okay. - He just looked at your ass, looked it up and down. - Can you blame him? - Hell no. - Yo. - Hey, there he is, where you been, man? - It's not like the show starts in 10 minutes or anything. - Sorry, I ran into an old buddy. He's doing a Cabaret show down the street. - Right on. Well, there, you go. - Thank you. Happy birthday, kid. - [Grace] Thank you. - It's been a while, it's good to see you. - You too. - Oh, this is my boyfriend, Andrew. - Think we met at the Turkey's Nest a while back. You must be legit, I never heard Kelly call anyone her boyfriend before. - [Kelly] Oh, shut it. - What can I say? I'm too legit to quit. - [Kelly] Stop. - Listen, now, don't get me wrong. I appreciate you putting on your jacket for this evening. I'm sure it was difficult. However, these tickets, they're invalid. - Excuse me. - Look at it. I mean, if you would have put on your jacket, say, yesterday, this wouldn't be a problem. - Can you guys give me a second? I'm gonna figure this out. - Yeah. - Sure. - It's fine, okay? Yeah, we'll be good. - The opening is in eight days, so things are a little hectic right now. (phone pinging) That is my boss, now. Yeah, things are crazy. - Yeah, Jack's been filling me in. - Yeah, right. I'm kinda jealous, I think you're the only person he shares that damn book with. - Barely share. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah, I'm an open book for you. - Is it, honestly, is it good? - [Jack] God dammit. - Hey, baby, did you handle it like a man? - I took it like a man, banned from the theater. Let's go. What a pompous prick, an asshole. - Oh come on, bro, who doesn't look at the dates on the tickets they're buying from some dude on Craigslist? - Grace, I'm so sorry, I shoulda checked the dates. - Jack, it's okay. - No, it's not. It's just, they were cheaper online. Not to say that your birthday isn't worth the money. That's not what I'm-- - Look, before you dig yourself any deeper, why don't we just go back to our place? You know, I've been wanting to have people over for a whole, it's a good excuse. - Do you guys got booze? - Do we have booze? - Okay, we actually don't, we should pick some up. - Just like the old days. We used to pound them pretty hard back in the day. - Oh yeah, the two of you were pounding it? - Don't be gross. - Oh but don't sleep on this girl. Her visits to Oberlin were epic. - Stop (laughs). - I really want to go somewhere exotic, somewhere out of the country. - Okay, really, because I still don't forgive you for leaving me alone on that French class trip. I had to room with Callie Fucking Martin. - Oh, excuse me for hitching a ride and getting in trouble for going to Rock the Boat while you snuck in to Andrew Porter's hotel room. - Well, are we still jealous about that one? - Yeah. - Oh, well, he was hot. (laughing) (sighing) (horn honking) - Hey. (chuckling) - What? What? No, look, I'm happy he's here. - Only. - I am, I am, almost as happy as I am that you're here, thank you. Thank you. (laughing) Like a Flower Child. (exhaling) - Yeah. All right. - [Jack] How does this place not have any cakes? - Whoa, whoa, naw, man. - What? They're delicious. - You know she prefers chocolate. - Huh? - Dude, you know this. - Yeah, no, you're right. Okay, I just, I gotta make up for this fuck-up of a night. Just when she was getting over her little issue too. - Yeah? - Yeah, we had a nice roll in the hay earlier. - Roll in the hay. - Fuck sesh? - Okay, I've heard enough. - [Jack] Jealous? - Yeah, the thought of you rolling or gyrating or fucking is enough to kill my buzz. - [Jack] How's Tim doing? - He's so good, gonna see him real soon. - I hope he knows how bad ass his uncle is, getting texts from beautiful, exotic women. - What? - Ben, it's Friday night and you're getting texts. Who's the girl? - Nobody, I met her a couple nights ago. Russian dominatrix. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Hey, you think they got any more of these? - How the fuck would I know if they have any more of those? - Hey, do you have any more of these? - Just what we got's there, sorry. - All right, do you have candles? - [Clerk] I have some candle over there. - What the hell? Oh, hey, I'm gonna have some pages for you by the end of the week. - Well you have to email them to me. Moving back to Buffalo. - What? - I shoulda said something sooner, it's just-- - Are you actually leaving this time? - Yeah, I mean, it's up in the air, but yeah. - Is everything okay? - I'm just going through some things, man, rearranging priorities. - All right. - By the way, do not-- - Yeah, yeah, so Ben's leaving New York tomorrow. - Tell everyone. - What, really? - Yeah, I'm-- Yeah, I'm moving. (upbeat party music) - Follow, follow, that's not following. (laughing) That's not following, okay. - [Kelly] Where are you? - I'm right here. - [Kelly] Right there? - [Andrew] My lips are literally at the donkey's anus. (murmuring) - Hello. - [Jack] Would you get outta here? - I wanna see you. - [Jack] Sure, but I'm working on a secret surprise that you're just gonna have to wait to see. - Oh. What kind of surprise? - [Jack] It's very surprise, secretive. I don't know, just don't be in here, all right. - Okay. - [Jack] I'll be out in a minute. - Fine. - [Jack] Having fun? - Mm-hmm. - [Jack] Good, all right. I'm bringing out the fun in a minute. - Oh, my. Bye, bye. - [Jack] No, no. - [Andrew] Listen, seven. - Seven. - Okay, street. - That's my favorite number, baby. - Are you gonna get in there and show her how it's done? - No thank you, I'm getting dizzy on my own. Did you guys go to Jay's? - Yep. - What are you doing spending your last night at a liquor store? - To be fair, I thought I was spending my last night at the theater. - Okay, touche. - Clear eyes, full heart. - Can't lose. - Clear eyes, full heart! - Can't lose! - Liar, let's put it on the game board. - [Kelly] Let's do it. - I'm sure you have some ladies you'd like to see. - Ladies? - Come on, I think Jack lives vicariously through you. - Jack exaggerates. And besides, where else am I gonna find entertainment like this? - Oh my God. - Don't tell me what to do. - I'm gonna leave you then. - Fine. Don't need you. - [Andrew] Okay. - I love you, but I don't need you. - Oh, I love you too. - I hear you going, but I'm gonna do it. (laughing) - You got it. - Okay. (phone dinging) - Grace, how's it feel to be joining the lates? - What? - You know, you're going from your mid-20s to your late 20s, that's a big transition. - No I'm not. - You're telling us you're not in your late 20s right now? - No, I'm 27. - Exactly. - No no no, your early 20s are 20 to 23. Your mids are 24 to 27. Your lates are 28 and 29. - So late 20s only gets two years? - Yes. Oh, fuck. I see what you mean. - [Andrew] Hey, it's okay, late 20s are great. I still miss them. - Baby, look, I got it. I don't know, I don't know where it went. (soft music) ♪ I don't know when, but I can't decided just yet ♪ ♪ I don't know what you think ♪ ♪ I don't wanna watch you, babe ♪ - Who's got the best non-birthday cake in the world? - Looks like I do. - What's up, sis? Wait, hold on. Slow down. - No, no no, that's not necessary. - Come on, you only turn 27 once. - Or any age really. - Yeah, of course we are singing. - Stop, you know I-- (upbeat party music) - All right. Yeah, yeah, I agree. I'll talk to her. Yes, I promise. I will talk to her. (cars crashing) - What the fuck was that? No. No, no! No no, no no no, no, no no no, no no, no, no. - I just, sorry, this could be serious. (door closing) (upbeat party music) - What the fuck, dude? Bro, that's my fucking car. Get out, I'm gonna kick your ass. - Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Oh my God, fuck, holy shit. - Baby, our weekend trip to Martha's Vineyard is out. - [Ali] I'm really sorry, I just-- (swallowing and burping) (exhaling) - You guys, I'm so sorry. It was just-- - I even moved the car from this side of the street to the other side of the street because of street cleaning, and now this fucking problem. - I know, I saw it, I saw it, but it wasn't your fault. She hit you. - Sorry, it's my first night. I didn't see it, it's-- - Look at my, look, look at this. - Dude, relax, we'll figure it out, okay? - Wait, you look like, you look familiar. Are you something? - I wrote a book that was pretty popular. - Can we get back to the catastrophe here, Christ? - Oh my God, you're bleeding. - I'm bleeding? - No, she is. - Oh, shit. - You've got renter's insurance, right? - No, nobody buys rental car insurance. - What did Jack write? He looks familiar. - Let It Go, it was about his dad. - Oh, the dead dad book! I totally read that thing. - You have insurance, right? - Of course. Oh, I haven't transferred it to New York yet, though. - Why the hell not? - I literally just moved here, relax. - [Andrew] Don't tell me to relax, Jesus. - This is her fault, right? - Uh, yeah, yeah, but it's her first night in the city, so, give her a break. - [Andrew] No, I will not hold. Did I buy insurance? No, I didn't buy insurance. Because nobody fucking buys car rental insurance. - So what, you're telling me you're really gonna leave all of this excitement? - Well, people do some crazy things. Makes you wonder. - Apparently, she's an actress. I'm sure you can impress her. - You're very funny today. Naw, she's a little too young for me. - Okay then. Slugger. I don't. - It's six months? No, you guys have been together longer than that. - [Andrew] Nope, that's it. - Well, this girl is awesome. Cleaned all the blood off my face. - Nice blood cleaning, babe. - Thank you. Thank you. - It's a really good job. - [Ali] She's a keeper. - Yeah, well that's why I asked her to marry me. - Why? - What? - No, that's great. - No, you, you're getting married? - I'm sorry, I didn't think we were gonna talk about this tonight. - I know, but I couldn't contain it. - Did she say yes? - Of course I said yes. - She said yes. - Good, you're getting married. - I'm, I'm sorry. - No, it's wonderful. - Why are you apologizing? You're getting married. - Well it's her birthday. - This is your birthday? - Yeah. - Well, how old are you turning? - Congratulations to the happy couple. - [Andrew] Thank you. - Oh, wait, I don't have anything. - [Kelly] I'll drink to that. - Is this real by the way? Just for legal purposes, you're 21 and we didn't buy you this alcohol. - Who wants another round (cheers)? Come on, let's do it again, do it again. - So when was the first time that you and Grace had sex? No, I guess that's inappropriate. - [Ali] Come on, you guys, it's a birthday. It's the big Three Oh, right? No. (upbeat party music) (laughing) (chattering) Yeah, I'm gonna be great at driving home later tonight. - Well you were so great with it sober. (laughing) - Married to a woman named Pam. - [Jack] Pam? - Pam has a twin sister named Paula. - [Jack] Uh-huh. - [Ben] Grace. (chattering) Wow, you were really consistent. - Do you like it? - Yes. - So, you've gotta tell me, from a dude's perspective. - Only perspective I got. - Can I be honest with you? - Yes. - You don't really seem like the marriage type. - I didn't know you were a doctor. - I'm an actor. It's my job to be in tune with human emotions. I took a class on it. - Okay. - I mean, you seem really cool minus the whole emotional immaturity thing. - Well, you hit my car. What made you pop the million-dollar question. - Honestly? - No, lie to me. - Ah, nailed it. - So what was it? - It's called the litigator, we make it at my firm. How do you like Kelly's drink? - Oh, I'm sorry, was this hers? - Yep. - She really drinks this? You make this for her all the time? - Yeah, she loves it. Mm-hmm. - [Ben] Really, what? - God, don't get me started. - I know these aren't yours from when you were a kid. - What makes you say that? - This has Madison written on it in Sharpie. - Okay, I bought that one. - So what, are you getting like a jump-start on the next hipster fad? - That's what I said. - No, thank you, I'm not. I just happen to enjoy viewing the movies of my childhood in the format I originally saw them. Plus, you have a record player, those are old. - Records sound better than digital, it's a fact. - Well, I'm sorry that I enjoy viewing Amadeus the same way I did when I was a kid. - Amadeus? That's what you were watching when you were a kid? What were you, six? Had your balls dropped yet? - No, they hadn't, but watching that movie helped. (laughing) - This explains so much. - Does it? - Yeah. - Like what? - I don't know, you're fucking weird. - What, it's a great movie. What were you watching when you were six? - The Little Mermaid. - Is she an Aries? I bet she is. - I have no idea. - I am too, and I think that's why it surprised me so much when she said yes after only six months. I mean, that's my longest relationship ever. - Hers too. Um, actually. I love her. I don't want her to get bored of me, though. - So you locked that shit down? Get it, bro. - Yeah, I locked that ass down (imitates explosion). Or whatever. - What are my parents hiding from me? Two midgets, shitting in a bucket. - Whoa. - Eight. - [Ben] That was mine. (laughing) - You can't say it. - [Ben] Oh, I'm not supposed to? - No. - No. - We have to establish the rules beforehand. - [Jack] You ruined everything Ben. - I got 99 problems, but Rush Limbaugh's soft shitty body ain't one. I got 99 problems, but the unstoppable tide of Islam ain't one, I don't know what that is, y'all. - I know I've only been here a couple of hours, but I don't think I ever wanna leave. - The apartment? - No no no, the city. But your place is so beautiful, and the artwork is super nice. - Thank you, work sorta demands it. - Yeah. Work stuff? - Yeah. - Yeah, Jackie Boy was talking about it. Don't let it ruin your life. - Okay, excuse me. - Do you want the last Twinkie? No, you can have it. This is, I mean. - I honestly haven't had a Twinkie in a long time. - No, dude, I already had one, you can have it. - [Jack] Well, that's true. - [Ali] Okay, who's this to, who's it to? - To the birthday girl. - The birthday girl. - The birthday girl. - [Ben] Happy birthday. (cheering) - [Jack] What were your other options there? - Getting really high. - Yeah, yeah, you would totally do that. - He knows me. (laughing) - Is there weed? - No. - Um, do you have any, lawyer? - Oh, absolutely, yeah. I just worked on a case, and I got paid in weed. (laughing) - [Jack] Who was the client? - I'm not at liberty to tell you. That's actually serious, I can't tell you who. - Oh, all right. - All right. - [Ben] Next round. (chattering) (soft music) (chuckling) - I can't imagine going through that with your dad. I actually gave the book to my friend. Her mom passed from brain cancer, and it really helped her so much. My gosh, that watch is so cool. Wow. Is it working? - The battery musta just died. - [Ali] That sucks. - Yeah. - So, um, what are you working on now? - A novel, actually. - Really? I can't wait for that. - Yeah, you're not alone. It's just taking longer than I'd hoped. - Well, you can't rush art. - Thank you. You know, I know that I could just vomit out some fluff, pop novel that's ready to be turned into a movie. That's what we're doing with Let It Go. - Really, movie? - Yeah, yeah, totally. I just, I feel like I wanna do more. You know, I wanna tell something that can be funny and emotional, but raw and speaks to the time that we're living in. That has something to say, that doesn't spoonfeed you information, make the audience feel like an idiot. - What is it about? - Uh, I don't know, I haven't really. - [Ali] Cross my heart. ♪ I ain't a dog, baby, I ain't bark at you ♪ ♪ I'm just trying to let you know ♪ ♪ That I ain't no stalker dude ♪ ♪ I just asked you for your name, baby, ♪ ♪ Trying to talk to you ♪ ♪ I ain't trying to spit no game ♪ - What? - Come on, you love dancing. - Not with you. - Yeah you do. ♪ But still I will try to be that main nigger in your life ♪ - Is that work stuff? - You know it. - We need to talk, Grace. - Yeah, what's up? - My sister called tonight. - That's great, how's Tara doing? - You know why she called, Grace. - Little fish. - Oh, Grace, you wanna dance? - Oh yes, please, thank you. (dance music) ♪ Bump the butt, bump the butt ♪ (throat clearing) (laughing) - Girls, pfft. Yeah. - Okay, so it's about a guy who totally goes off the grid after his sister dies. And they were really close and it totally took him by surprise, it wasn't a cancer thing or anything like that, it was a car accident. And he didn't know how to keep living. So he just shut everybody out of his life, and moved as far as away as possible. And so the whole, the novel is written through these letters that he writes with the girl he left behind. He didn't want to, but he had to, you know, and then in the end, in the end he realizes that his sister would have wanted him to keep living, not holed up in isolation. I don't know, I'm still figuring it out. - Isn't that how you wrote Let It Go? - No, well, yeah, I mean it's really just a framework, I guess, it's not verbatim. Grace and I didn't write letters. - Wait, you dated Grace in college? - I know it sounds trite, I just, I felt like I needed to go on the writer's journey, you know. So I took a lot of life insurance money and went upstate and moved into a cabin and shut myself off of social media and the internet and all of it. And it was amazing. - Yeah, I'd love to live without technology. (phone pinging) Keep going, I'm listening. - Oh no, that was about it. - Grace, you just left her? - Well, it was more complicated than that. But yeah, a year and a half later, I'd finished the book and I was living in the city, and I walked out of a meeting and there she was, on 23rd and Eighth. And it was like nothing had changed. She was still the same beautiful, smart, funny girl she's always been. - [Ali] Well, if this next books is half as good as Let It Go, you're gonna blow my mind. - I'd certainly like to try. - Jack. You know, I read it, too, your book. - Really? - Well, most of it. I mean, it's pretty rough stuff. Think I'm gonna save the rest of it for a rainy day. When somebody has cancer. - So when are you two gonna pop out a little one? - I know I'd like to have kids fairly soon. - Not you, him. - I thought you read the book. That's not going to happen. - [Ali] Like never? - No, the fewer people you can leave in pain, the better. - [Ali] God you're dark. - [Jack] That's just Schopenhauer. - [Ali] Okay. (throat clearing) - Wanna get a drink? - Dry Land is not a myth. I've seen it! Kevin Costner, Water World. I don't know what all the fussing's about, saw that movie-- (laughing) Saw that movie six times, it rules! - Cable Guy! - Yeah, baby! - You might wanna put on your bathing suit, because you'll be channel surfing in no time. - In no time. (laughing) - [Ali] You guys are so good. - Yeah, they should be, they've been quoting that movie since forever. I think Andrew should go next. - No, baby. - Yeah, baby. - No. - Yeah, baby. - [Jack] Come on, man, you got this. - Please, you can just do it? - Okay. - Okay. - All right. - Yeah. - Let's get this over with. Let's do this. - Come on. - Come on. (laughing) - All right, I haven't eaten in a while. - Are you kidding, I just saw you eat. - No, that's my first clue. - [Grace] Oh, okay. - Okay, um. I need some food for what we're doing right now. - Aqua Teen Hunger Force. - No, what we're doing right now is fun. This activity. - Game? - He Got Game? - Fun and Games? - No, um. I'm starving. - Thinner? - No, I'm fucking hungry. - Hunger Games. Come here, baby. - Yeah, you got it. - You did it. - Well played. - Ben, why don't you get up there. - Yeah, you go. - Okay. - [Jack] Get an actor up there. - Let's see what we got up here. Oh come on. (laughing) You know, when I was a kid, maybe around eight? Okay, exactly eight. Home Alone Two, Lost in New York had just come out, and I wanted to see this thing more than anything in the world. So I beg and beg my dad. Mom was already gone at this point. I'm not sure exactly where she was living. But besides the fact that my dad would much rather stick pin needles in his eyes than see this movie, there's a problem. Okay, two problems. One is that there's a Browns game on TV, an away game. My dad hasn't missed a game in four seasons, so they need by dad's help from his Lazy Boy more than anything, and he's gotta watch it. And the second thing is that there's this unbelievable blizzard outside. I mean, if this was the Oregon Trail, we would have been fucked, but I was with my dad, so I knew we'd make it. So I won't leave him alone, and finally he relents. And we get there alive. He buys more popcorn than he can afford to, and we watch this flick. Well, the Browns lost, and my dad was down for about a week, and he didn't blame me, but I could tell he hated that movie as much as I loved it. And, I mean I was pretty bummed about that, but, that Christmas, he gave me the coolest gift I've ever gotten. A Talk Boy. Just like Macaulay Culkin had in that film. Now it was basically just a tape recorder, but it had a few extra buttons on it that could change the tone of your voice, can make it higher or lower. And I was obsessed, but mainly with harassing my dad with it. He went along with it pretty well until, one night (chuckles), I snuck out of bed with it, and I recorded this line that was really deep and raspy. It was like, Open the door. I've come for the boy. And I sneak into his room, right by his bed, and I press play. Well, in the haze of waking up, he had no idea what the hell was going on. And I'm sitting there, laughing in my hands, until I look up to find a flashlight on me and my dad in his tighty whiteys (laughs), pointing a service revolver at me. I mean, I've never seen someone so relieved and so completely pissed off at the same time. It was really impressive. He confiscated that thing right then and there. But anyway, years later, in the hospital, right before he passed, he gives me this box. And he tells me to take it home, not to open it in front of him. I'm like, okay. And I completely forget about it until this morning, I found it up in the attic. I opened it up, and it's the Talk Boy. He'd kept it, all those years. And on it was one message. It was him. And it said, next time, we're going to see the Browns. It just seemed so unhealthy to be carrying around a message like that. So I just deleted it. I already wish I hadn't. - Caddyshack? - Close (laughs). - Who put this hack's name in the hat? - I did. I was just expecting Charades, but that was amazing. - Yes, it was, I guess you do have a little bit of talent. - You're too kind. (laughing) - Jack? - I am not following that. - You know, I'm gonna go outside and get some fresh air. - You mean smoke? - Yeah, fresh air. - How are you still doing that? - Well, my name is Ben, and I'm addicted. - [Ali] I'll join. - [Grace] That's 10 minutes off your lives. - Thanks, Mom. Don't act like you don't miss it. - [Ali] Don't worry about it. - [Andrew] I can tell your handwriting. - Yeah (laughs). So, they might be a while. Presents. - Oh, yippee! - Definitely, here, I'll be right back. - Somebody turn the couch around. - Okay. - [Andrew] Jack, maybe, okay. (shrieking and laughing) (laughing) Watch out for that beer. I got the beer. - [Grace] I got it, I got it! (laughing) - [Kelly] Good. - Thank you. - You bet. - You were in the zone. - What? - I mean, downstairs, you, like you were feeling it, I could see it in your eyes. - Yeah, in my eyes? - [Ali] Yes. - Yeah, I use that monologue for auditions sometimes. - Yeah, I have a scene like that, too, actually, from Perks of Being a Wallflower. I actually did it in the finals for the International Thespian Society. It's a great book, I love it, have you read it? - A long time ago. - A long time ago. - A long time ago. (laughing) - [Ali] You can't be that old, right? (laughing) - I like to pretend I am, but I'm not. - Well have you been in anything that I might have seen? - I don't know, you tell me. - [Ali] Okay, um. - No, a lot of guest star shit. - [Ali] Oh, that's cool, like what, what kinda stuff? - Basically like the New York trifecta, you know, all the Law and Orders. - [Ali] Oh, my dad loves those. - Mine too. - You get out to LA much? - Yeah, a couple of times I went out there for pilot season, but, it's New York. Everything about this city is, something just keeps bringing me back. - Yeah, totally, it's, there's really no place like it. I mean, I still, I don't know, still have to go to auditions and get an agent and all of that. I really don't think it'll be too hard, because I did this camp, and the director actually said that-- - Ali, listen. I really hope this works out for you. (friends chattering) - [Grace] Interesting, so, I got nothing. ♪ I got three tickets to paradise ♪ ♪ Do do do ♪ - [Grace] Oh, thank you, Andrew. - I told him you're not a basketball fan. - But then I told her, if there's one way to fall in love with the game, it's to see it with a couple of friends. - Yeah, good friends. - Especially when we can sit there and explain it to you. - I believe that. - Yeah, these are awesome. Good luck getting her to go, though. - Hey, no, really, thank you. This is actually exactly what I needed. Just get me away from all these books for a while. - Just three tickets, huh? - Oh yeah, man, I, um, I just had to kill a guy with a chainsaw just to get three. It's a figure of speech. - Is it? I don't-- - Yeah. (laughing) - Well thank you. - I know how tense you've been recently, and so. Tada. - I'm hoping to God this is, oh my God. - Yeah, six one-hour sessions with me. - [Grace] Oh my gosh, thank you so much. - [Kelly] Yeah. - You have no idea how much I needed this. - Good. - Thank you. - Of course, happy birthday. - [Grace] Thank you. - [Ali] I just always dreamed about this, you know, like the city, the life, the skyline, it's, God, it's perfect. - All gone? - Well, I have some more. - Oh no no no no no. - Oh come on, come on. - What are you trying to do to me? - Okay, sorry. (soft music) - You don't want me in this moment with you. - Look, I heard you were leaving, and I don't care. Lights, and this moment, it's, it's perfect. Why ruin it? (vomiting) What the fuck, man? Like seriously? What's your fucking deal? Jesus, ugh! - Hey, listen, I'm sorry. Aw fuck, shit. - Hmm. (fingers tapping drumroll) I like drumrolls. My God. - [Andrew] Oh that's really adorable. When was that? - [Kelly] That was the first night they met. - Yeah. Jack spilled a beer all over someone while I took that picture. - Yeah, I was in rare form that night. - I think you puked in Jesse Price's bushes. - [Jack] I think I did. (laughing) - [Kelly] Oh, look, little gross love notes. - [Grace] I know. - Yeah, the first ones we wrote. - Thank you. - [Andrew] Are you guys still doing that? - Oh fuck, motherfucking shit! Dammit! - Uh, four rum and cokes? - Yes. - Yeah. - [Andrew] Mike mine a double. - Dude, what happened? - Yeah, man, I thought you had that in the bag. - Here. - Ugh. - Aw, man, you look like shit. I'm gonna go make a phone call. K. - Yeah, drink up, man. - [Ali] I even thought we could do some teamwork together or something. I mean, look at that monologue and tell me it is not Meisner. - That's not Meisner. - Fuck, can I not go 10 minutes without getting some nasty junk on my shirt? - It's my shirt, actually. - [Ali] Where the fuck is Triple A? - Welcome to the city. - [Ali] Yeah, thanks. - At least Ben puked on you and didn't lock that ass down. - [Grace] Andrew said that? - [Ali] You heard that, huh? - Yeah. I mean, like, how fucking unromantic is that? - I'm sorry you heard that, hon. - Fucking Triple A. I mean, no offense, I wanna get away from those weirdo guys as soon as possible. I mean like, you guys, though, you guys are super cool. I'm hooking up with my friend Lauren tonight. We were supposed to go to like-- (door creaking) Where there are a lot of male models. (truck passing) - I figure we're past cocktails at this point, right? - Hmm, talk to me. - What? (laughing) - You've seemed off all night, and I don't think it's like the play or the vomit or the car. It's something else, what's up? - Honey, we can't all be having the time of our lives getting married. - Okay. - What? Come on, I'm kidding. I'm joking, stop it. (phone pinging) Fucking kidding me, come on. - Triple A says it'll be another half hour. Is it cool if I take a shower? I smell like drunk vomit. - Um. - Yeah, that's fine. - Okay, thanks. - Straight up, that bitch has got to go. - She's gotta go. - I fucking, hate her. - (laughs) You don't hate her. - No, I do, I just met her and I hate her. - She's come into our lives at a point in time which is like the worst possible time, but you deeply dislike her, her energy. - Yeah, I hate it. (laughing) (dog barking) - All right, so you're not actually moving, are you? - Last six years have caught up with me, man. Been trying to build something here, but it's just been audition to audition. Drink to drink, smoke to smoke. It's all bullshit, repetitive bullshit. - Dude, we all have bullshit we have to deal with. I mean, this novel-- - The novel, really, now? Listen, you got you and her. You don't have any other responsibilities. - Responsibilities? Dude, it's you and you. - I never see Tim. - [Jack] You see him more than my uncles ever saw me growing up. - I'm not his uncle. - [Jack] No I get it, you're his brother from another mother. - Oh please, don't talk black. - [Jack] Sorry. (dog barking) - I'm his dad, Jack. - Fuck off. - Tara and Clark are his legal guardians, but I'm his father. Biologically. - How did you never tell me that? What do you want me to say, man? - God, do you even hear yourself? - Does he know? - Yes of course he knows, we didn't lie to the kid. He knows who I am, but eventually he's gonna start asking questions, questions like, Why doesn't he wanna be with me? He looks up to the two of them, and I'm just this guy that comes around one weekend a month. And I've been trying to build something here for us, but-- - Who's the girl? - Don't worry about it. It was a long time ago. (traffic passing) - You know, um, the last few months, his voice has been fleeting, fading. And, then it happened. I woke up one morning, last week actually, and it was gone. Ben, I don't remember what my dad's voice sounded like. And, um, it's awful. He didn't have a choice, he had to go, but you don't. So. Cheers, brother. - Cheers. (sighing) - Do you remember those letters we got in high school? - Yeah, check here for yes, check here for no. - Pretty sure that was elementary school. - No, no, not when it was Keenan Jackson asking you for a handjob in the parking lot. - Oh my God, oh, I forgot about him. - Oh yeah, he still pops up on my Facebook feed, and he is married and he has a kid. - That's a shame. - I know. - No, no, I was talking about those letters they made us write ourselves, like about where we'd be in 10 years. - Oh, God, those were dumb. - Did you get yours? - No, how would they find me? - Well, I got mine. - Yeah? - Yeah, a couple months ago. Do you remember what you wrote? - No, not a clue. - Well, if you read it now, what would you think? - [Kelly] Well what do you mean? - Like how would it make you feel? - Oh, um. Amused, maybe. I mean, when I was 18, I wanted to be a Rockette dancer, or an archeologist. But never in my life did I think I would want to be married to Andrew. (laughing) - Yeah, well, that was a surprise. - Grace, he's a lawyer, you know, he has a job. It's the first time in my life I am with someone that has his shit together. - Kelly, I know you. You get tired of people. Jobs, apartments, things. It's always something new. - [Kelly] That's not true. - Okay, Kel, I'm not gonna sit here and list off the jobs and boyfriends you've had over the past few years, but we both know it would take 10 hands to count. - Grace, I am so sorry that I don't have my shit together like you do. - Don't be sorry. Jesus, Kelly. You know, if anything I envy you. Yeah, your ability to seemingly float from one job, one boyfriend, one life to another. Yeah, I got my letter. And, it scared the shit outta me. You know, everything that I said I wanted to happen happened. I live my life like a checklist. And anything that wasn't on that list, had to go. I made a huge fucking mistake thanks to that checklist. The ultimate life changer, and I made the wrong choice. - No, Grace. Grace, you were young. When we are young, we make our choices and they all seem like the wrong choice to make. - That's all I see you doing is making the wrong one, making a mistake. - A mistake? - Kelly, you hardly know him. - I know what I need to know. - You know what, back then, people in my life, they sat there, they didn't say anything to me, but I'm not gonna do that to you. - Sweetie, you didn't wanna listen. - Neither do you. - Grace, look at me. You can't go back there, okay? Okay, you can't, you just can't. - I just, I haven't had one in so long, and and they're so good. - I know, it's okay. - Okay, but just one. - Just one. - Okay, yeah, just one. - Okay, great. - Great. - Let's go. - Let's go, yeah yeah yeah. - Wait, you already came and went? - [Driver] Pick up the phone next time. - Well what am I supposed to do now? - [Driver] Car's in the shop. I'll let you know the damage tomorrow. - No no no, I mean now, like tonight. - [Driver] Welcome to the city. (traffic passing) - So you feeling better? - Yeah, bro, puking all over a hot chick under the moonlight was exactly what I needed. Romance. - Glad to hear it. - By the way, thank you so much for the talk. That was, that was good for me. - Me too, man. Grace? Kelly? Gets me every time. Kelly? Grace, are you in here? - What the fuck? - Whoa, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were in here. - Close the goddam door, Jesus. - Right, right, okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. For the record, it's not that big a deal. I didn't see everything. So. Sorry. - Get me up with your movie people, I'll show you more. - The shit's never as good as you remember, fuck. Oh. Laura? - Grace? Oh my goodness, Grace. - [Grace] Hi. - Brandon, this is my sister Grace. - [Grace] Hi, nice to meet you. - And her dear friend. - Kelly. - [Laura] Oh, Kelly, I'm so sorry. - It's fine. - Where are you guys coming from? - The Gregg Starkk Show. - How was it? - Unless the show was on her phone, I don't think she saw any of it. - No. - Yeah, I got all your messages. - [Laura] You didn't respond. - It is my birthday. - Oh, yes, it is. Come with me, I wanna show you something. Is that okay? - [Grace] Yeah, of course, yeah. - Is it okay? - Hey, um, uh, can I get the, uh. - You look a little baffled. Can I help you with something? Would you like a specialty, or you wanna see a menu? - Um, what, so this is all the menu? - I have an extensive menu here on paper you can read real quickly. But if you're looking for a sandwich or a plate of food, if you wanna just specify that, I'll help you out a little bit. - The, um, what's the, um. (hard breathing) - Wait, wait, uh. I'm not that kinda guy. - Okay, good, makes it easier for me. Get me some meetings, or I will tell Grace everything. - Is it, can I get the, uh, can I get the shit? - [Restaurateur] We don't have the shit here. - Okay, I'm just looking for like the most, like what's the most Brazilian thing you have? - My wax. - Your wax? - [Restaurateur] Yeah I have a wax job, Brazilian wax job. (upbeat pulsing music) (phone clicking) - Hey, I'm just wondering where you are. I hope you're okay. (upbeat pulsing music) - Who is that guy? - He's a sculptor. - Anything you like? - I don't know, but if I do, he's mine. I was gonna wait until after the show, but maybe I'm on flow, and I thought you could use a little pick-me-up. - Laura, I-- - I took a chance on you four years ago, and I've never regretted it. You've been a bit distant lately, and I just wanna-- - I know, I'm sorry, there's just been a lot on my mind. - Grace, if you really want this, I see you running your own gallery one day, not mine, yours, and I think you'd be damn good at it. So here it is. The buyer job is yours. - Wow. - [Laura] Big. - Yeah. - [Laura] You've earned it. - [PA] Okay, this is Engine Six, making a local stop. (car clacking) 14th Street, the next three exits to the L train. (traffic passing) (cans banging) (door opening) - Hey, where have you guys been? - Where's Andrew? - I was just offered the buyer's job from Laura. - Babe, that's great. - Is he in the bathroom? - Is Ali still here? - Don't worry, I'm leaving in a sec. - Ben just told me he's a dad. - You told him? - She already knows? - Oh my God. What the fuck is wrong with you people? - Nothing, nothing's wrong with us. - You're like 30, and you're all total losers. There's something seriously wrong with all of you! I will be in touch. I'm gonna go hang out with normal people who do normal things! - What a bitch. - [Grace] What did she mean she'd be in touch? - So do you know about Tim? - [Grace] What did you tell him? - I'm standing right here, he told me he's Tim's dad, something you seemingly already know? What is going on? (knocking on door) What do you want now? - Hey, man. Did anybody get her insurance information? She just told me to fuck off. - Andrew, where have you been? - Kelly, hey. - Why do you have more food? - It's actually symbo-- - Forget about the food for five seconds, Andrew, Jesus. - What's going on? - Great question, it's nice to know I'm not the only one that's out of the loop. - [Ben] Okay, I've told you everything I have to. - [Jack] Why is everyone acting like this is a state secret? - [Kelly] Cool down! - [Jack] What is going on? - He's mine. Tim is mine, he's my child. - She has a kid? - No, she, doesn't. - How is, what, what is that smell that's coming from the damn bag? - Jack, I really think we should talk. - You just ate! - The food is for Kelly. Kelly, this is for you. - [Kelly] Is this? - [Andrew] Brazilian food? - [Kelly] Mm-hmm. - Yeah. I heard what you said in the bathroom with the girls about me locking you down. I don't wanna do that. I know you're a wanderer, and I wanna wander with you. - [Kelly] I'm not going anywhere (laughs). - Tasted like a burrito. - [Kelly] Um, we should go, we should go. - [Andrew] Yeah, yeah. - Call me. - Yeah. - Listen, you can keep Pin the Tail on the Donkey. All right. Happy birthday. - It happened while you were gone. It only went on for a little while, and then it was over. - Don't act like it was just a fling. - Why didn't you kill it? - Because he's my son. - You guys got together, once, multiple times? You got knocked up. All while I was gone dealing with the death of my father? - That's all you ever talk about. It's over, it's done, he's dead, get over it. - Jack! Jack, please. Jack. Shit. Do not touch me! - [Ben] Okay, let him calm down. - Did you not just see what happened? - Look, he'll be back. Grace, what are you doing? - [Grace] What do you mean? - Come on, you know what I mean. Why did you send him some gift? - Can we stop talking about the damn gift? It was just a stupid toy. - [Ben] Are you really that naive? - I guess I am. What's the big deal? - It's not about the gift. Five years ago, I would have loved that you were sending him gifts, that's all I ever wanted. But, now, You know it stays fresher for longer if you leave it in the fridge. (drawer slamming) - Can I have some space, please? (sighing) (door slamming) (hard breathing) (traffic passing) (traffic passing) (people chattering) (water boiling) - So what do we do now? - I need to wake up. (coffeemaker beeping) (laughing) Dammit. (laughing) - Perfect. (laughing) - I'm sorry I don't have any teabags. - You know, things have been unsettled for a while now. When I finally made this decision, I felt like a weight was lifted, you know, things slowly started to make sense, and then she told me what you did. You threw that feeling right out the window. - I'm really sorry, Ben. I am, I had no idea you were headed back. I just wanted to do something nice for Tim. - But did you do it to make him happy? Look, I know how you and Jack live. You go out on trips, out to fancy parties, networking at the gallery, laying around all day on Sunday, drinking coffee and reading the Times. It's a pretty, selfish life. - I'm not selfish. - Yes you are. And that's okay when it's just you. It's different with a kid involved. - I know that, Ben, Jesus. - You do? - Yes. - Okay, then what's your plan? - I could take the train up on weekends. You know, I could take him to a movie. I could babysit when Tara and Brian wanna go out. - You can't be half in. You could drop everything. You could quit the gallery gig and the cool friends. You could move up to Buffalo, start us back up again. - That's really unfair. Okay, this has nothing to do with us. This is about our son. - Okay. Good. This is about Tim. Do you want to be in Tim's life? - Ben. - Look, I'm leaving tomorrow. Forever, leaving, it ain't up in the air. Words are nothing, if you really want this, you can start by showing up. (soft music) (giggling) (soft music) (door opening) - Jack? (door closing) Hi. - I'm just here for my coat. - [Grace] Okay. - I just, I don't understand how I never noticed. - [Grace] Jack, you can't blame yourself. - I'm just here for my coat. - Okay, so why are you standing in the kitchen talking to me? Jack, come on, you can't do this like that, okay? I getta say something, one thing. Look, when I found out, I was terrified. I went, and I lived with my parents the entire pregnancy. I didn't go out, I didn't share it. I was miserable. And I didn't think I'd ever see you again because you left me. And when I did see you, that day, it felt so good. I didn't wanna lose you again. So, no, I didn't tell you. And I didn't know that we'd get back together, but then we did. And then it just became something that I didn't ever wanna relive. - I've never seen a vagina go through something like that, so I guess I wouldn't have been able to notice. - I'm sorry, this is what you're thinking about? - I'm trying to figure out how I walked around like a clueless asshole. - You weren't a clueless asshole. You're not a clueless asshole. - You kept me in the dark for four years. - Because I didn't know how I felt about it, and I wanted to make sure how, I wanted to see how I felt before I could articulate it. - And now you wanna be a mom? - I don't know. - [Jack] Grace, I need you. - Do you want me? - What's the difference? - Jack, all you can think about is yourself. - You're the same way. That's what makes us work. Grace, this is the life that you've wanted, apparently since high school. - You shouldn't have gone through my things. - Let's not talk ethics. What would we do with a kid? There goes your buyer job, the late nights out with friends. - Okay, we have not gone out with friends in months. - Sure, you been working overtime and me with the novel, I mean, I-- - The novel, okay, look, Jack. Maybe you need to accept the fact that you're like Harper Lee. - Harper Lee? - She said everything in one book and had the good sense to realize that. - Maybe you're like Boo Fucking Radley. - What does that even mean? - It means she just released another book, and so will I. What do you want? - I want a family, Jack. - A normal life, a life like the people that we make fun of from our shitty hometowns? You know what I want? I want this, with everything that we went through, we found each other again. That's amazing. Look at your face, tell me you weren't happy. - Yeah. - [Jack] Yeah? - Yeah. - I haven't seen that smile in so long. I know that we haven't been this, but we can be again. A time when I spent all day writing and I couldn't wait to show you the pages. And you'd come home thrilled about the new artist you met and the clients and the contacts to further your career. Let's keep that going. Take the buyer job. I'll go with you, we'll be in Rome. I'll, I'll feel inspired, I'll finish my novel, and then we can celebrate and go on vacation together. We'll be excited again. - Even then, something was missing. - Okay, well, we can volunteer at a big sibling shelter. You wanna give back, that's fine. On the weekend, we can turn my office into a playpen. We can have kids running around here like a goddam refugee camp. But, if you're telling me you wanna be a mom, it's all or nothing with me. - Where are you going? - [Jack] You know where I'm going. - [Grace] At this hour? - Last call isn't for a couple hours. I made out with Ali tonight. - You're telling me this, why, to get back at me? - No, I stopped it, I did the right thing. - You want an award? - Grace, I love you.
