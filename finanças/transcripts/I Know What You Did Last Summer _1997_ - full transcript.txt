[CAR RADIO BLASTS] [CAR REVS AND SCREECHES] RAY: So the boy and girl are making out, right, when they hear over the radio that this lunatic killer's escaped from an insane asylum. He's got this long, sharp hook for a hand, right? BARRY: Dude, your tellin' it wrong. Shut up. So the girl, she gets all scared, right? She wants to go home. And the boy, all hot and bothered, he gets pissed and peels out. - No, no, no. That's not the way it goes. Okay, the boy goes for help, and the girl stays in the car, and she hears this, like, scratching sound— It's not a scratching sound. It's a drip. Drip, drip. No, it's scratching because the guy's been hung from a tree limb and his feet are scratching on the roof of the car. No. He's been decapitated, and it's the blood from his severed neck that's dripping on the car, and it's going, drip, drip, drip. No, he wasn't decapitated. He was gutted with a hook. That's the way I heard it. Look, you're all wrong. They get back to the girl's house and they find the lunatic's bloody hook in the car door. Now, that's the original story. That's the way it really happened. Hey, hey. None of it really happened. It's a bullshit ghost story to begin with. No, it's not. - It's true. - HELEN: Yeah, I don't think so, Ray. - I swear it. - JULIE: Please. It's a fictional story created to warn young girls of the dangers of having premarital sex. Well, actually, honey, and you know how terrified I am of your I.Q... it's an urban legend, American folklore. And they all usually originate from some sort of real-life incident. [WAVE CRASHES] [HELEN SHRIEKS AND LAUGHS] So, by that time, I will just be finishing my two-year contract on Guiding Light, coinciding with your first year as starting quarterback for the Steelers. - Cowboys. - Whoever.

You don't make that decision. Use your brain, Julie. We call the police, and we're fucked. It was an accident. Look, let's think about this a minute. Think about what? Think about what? He was crossing the road in the middle of the night, okay? It was an accident.

They wouldn't find the fucker for weeks. By that time all the evidence would be washed away. If they found him at all. The currents are strong. The undertow, it could carry him out to sea. I won't be any part of it. Look, I'm scared, Julie. Look, I'm not like the rest of you. I don't have your family or the money to get me out of this. Please. This is your future, Julie.

He was found three weeks after we... His body was caught in a shrimp net not far from Miller's dock. It was in the paper. I think the police called it an accidental drowning. You can call it an accident all you want, but he died because of us. That's certain. What about Ray? Have you shown this letter to him? What does he think? I haven't seen Ray since last summer. We broke up, and last I heard he was working up north. Okay, let's suppose somebody was there that night. Why send a letter one year later? Probably some crack fuckin' around. Max.

One to nothing here in the third. Garrett taking his time. Here's the pitch. Strike one. Wicked cut. Neale seemed fooled by that pitch. In fact, in addition to the split-fingered fastball...

Let's go back to the house. Where's your jacket, Barry? Don't you see? He's got us now. Okay, this is exactly what he wants. We can't go to the police. Not now. He's made sure of that. He's just out there and he's watching us and waiting. What are you waiting for, huh? What are you waiting for? What are you doin' here? Hey, I've been lookin' everywhere for you guys. You're gonna die. [GRUNTS] - Hey, stop it! - What are you doin'? - Stop it! Stop! - I didn't do anything! You're fuckin' lyin'. He's lying! Leave him alone, Barry. Get a grip. No, wake up, Julie! He's behind this. How many fucked-up fishermen are out there? Look, he's after me too. I got a letter. Oh, you got a letter. I got run over, Helen gets her hair chopped off, Julie gets a body in a trunk and you get a letter? That's balanced. What body? What are you talking about? Drop the act. You killed Max, you took my jacket. - Max is dead? - What is it with you, Ray? You were doggin' us from the start, weren't you? Always wantin' to be our friend, to be one of us but you were too fuckin' jealous to handle it. - Look, fuck you! - JULIE: Stop it! Look, we have to stick together, all right? We have to help each other. Okay, so if it's not fisher boy here, who is it and how do we find him? We think his name is Billy Blue. How do you know that? Missy said there was a friend named Billy Blue. Who probably went to school with David Egan. So, according to sis, that would make him class of '92. Elsa was class of '92. Maybe there's something in her yearbook. RAY: That's him, huh? It's hard to believe that's the guy. Yeah, his face isn't splattered all over the road, dumb ass. Maybe Blue's not his real name. That's right. I mean, he could've easily lied to Missy. We did. Maybe we should bring the yearbook to Missy. - If she had it in front of her... - She could point him out. I'm not goin' anywhere. What... high school mug shots? What? I'll go. You've got that parade today. - Forget it. - No! No, you need to be there in case he shows up. I don't want him to show up! Look, Helen, this could be our chance. Okay, we could catch him. I'll go to Missy's. Barry, go to the parade with Helen and don't let her out of your sight. - If he shows up— - I'll pound his ass. Listen to yourselves. You sound like a bunch of vigilantes. It's July 4th, Ray. Okay? This is his day. Whatever he has planned is gonna happen today unless we stop him. Look, come on, Julie. Don't you see? It's that moment where we have to make a decision. Let's make the right one this time. I'm not interested in what's right anymore, Ray. I wanna do what's smart. Then let's get the hell out of here. We can leave town, disappear. I've already disappeared. Okay, now I want my life back. Look, we have to face this. What's it gonna be, Ray? [MARCHING BAND PLAYING "YOU'RE A GRAND OLD FLAG"] [CROWD CHEERS] [WHISTLE BLOWS] [CROWD SOUNDS SLOW] Barry? Barry! Over there! Move! [CROWD CHEERS] Move it! [GRUNTS] Oh, shit! Where the hell is he?

JULIE: I need to find your brother's friend, Billy Blue. I need to talk to him. I was thinking maybe you could look through this yearbook. What... what's this all about? Well, it's too crazy to explain, but it has to do with your brother and last July 4th. What about it? What happened to your brother wasn't an accident. There's more to it than that. - I know. - You know what? Well, he killed himself. He what? He, uh... he went up there to die that night. That's where Susie died. See, the whole town blamed him for her death. So, he blamed himself. But how do you know it was a suicide? He left a note. I had to keep this hidden from the insurance company 'cause they wouldn't... they wouldn't pay me the money, you know, if it was suicide. Uh... yeah, that don't much matter anymore because money's been spent. That's it. This isn't a suicide note. This is a death threat. What are you ta... what are you talking about? Your brother didn't kill himself, Missy. I saw him. I was there and whoever sent this was there too. What do you mean, where did you see him? Where? He was crossing the road. We hit him. - It was an accident. - No! - My brother drowned. - I saw him. He had "Susie" tattooed on his arm. - He doesn't have a tattoo on his arm. - I saw it on his right forearm. You didn't see anything! Get outta here. Get out of my house. [SHED DOOR SLAMS] Oh, my God. It wasn't your brother. PRESENTER: Testing. One, two, three, four. Leon, pull it up a little bit. There's gonna be a lot of people in here who can't hear it. Pull it up, just one, two, three... now that's got it. Don't nobody mess with it. Leave it right there, okay. Cut 'em. Stay calm. I'll be up in the balcony. He had a hook, Barry. I saw it. It was a big, huge hook. Everything's gonna be all right. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Very nicely done, ladies.

DIRECTOR: All right, ladies, places please. Places. There's nobody up here. I gotta tell you, this is really not my idea of a funny joke. - He was here. - Who was here? - The fisherman. He killed Barry! - Barry who? Who? Who we talkin' about? There's nobody up here. Come on. Let's go downstairs. Come on. There's nobody up here. Watch your step. PRESENTER: Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats. It was a false alarm. We're gonna resume in a few minutes. [BRAKES SCREECH] Ma'am, I'm gonna take you home.

[DISTANT PAGEANT MUSIC] [KEYBOARD TAPS] JULIE: Oh, come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry. POLICEMAN: So, then he killed him with a fishhook? HELEN: Yes. Did this fisherman use the same hook that cut your hair off? No, he used scissors, asshole. Look, okay, I know I sound delusional, but it's true. You know, I've heard this story before, except the way I heard it it wasn't a fisherman, it was an escaped mental patient and he had a hook for a hand. Well, we're gonna have to take the alley. Look, you little shit-stick, mayberry-ass reject, there's been a murder, and you're gonna fry in hell if you ignore it. All right, I'll tell you what I'll do, okay? I'll contact Barry's parents and we'll put out a search for him, all right? He was probably just playin' a prank on you. POLICEMAN: Oh, Jesus. Listen, I'm just gonna be a minute, all right? I'm gonna see if this fella needs help. [POLICE RADIO SOUNDS] It's... it's him. What's the trouble? That's him! Behind you! Behind you! [STRAINED GRUNT] No! [SQUELCHING GROANS] [PANTS] [STRAINS] No!
