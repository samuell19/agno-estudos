I'm worried about the baby in the stomach. What is it? Why is the police so concerned? It's overkill. The housewife was not arrested. The old man was drunk on the crossing. The housewife did not look ahead either. In addition, The old man named Meikawa is unconscious. Public account, please answer Are you going to condemn the newspaper for a name? what are you saying... It does not mean that, does it? The police are free to judge and hide the perpetrator. Maybe the police are covering up at will. concealment?

I have the right to reveal the name to the perpetrator. Right to say no? - Do not be bullshit. - Ignore human rights. It's a cowardly blurring of perspective! Public Affairs Officer! Do you really not reveal your name? I can not reveal his name. This is the police decision! It's changed, Mr. Mikami. When I came to the press, I expected. I tell the police the whole story of the reporter, not the publicist! Make sure you reveal your real name. The response was appropriate Just keep the anonymous issue parallel. Are you alright? what?

What happened to you and Amami? You're stupid. Mochitsuki! The killer is in the midst of the city and has a statute of just one year left. It's no wonder the police can not find the clue. Do not tell me. Be honest. What? You came because of Kouda memo, right? Kouda Memo? what is that? My father died and he retired early. It's easier to say than in active duty.

The publicist is in front of you. Yeah? I've said that before. Why are you here? I am an employee of the public affairs office. It came to work. The man does not look like that. It's not a woman. When you think about it, Think about it. It's out of sight. You are the publicist for your appearance. Give me instructions. Police organizations can only survive men. Men can not survive. I'm coward. What is cowardly? There you can see how hard the publicist is. Not to be seen. And you have to get your hands dirty. To direct a chief or principal to do something dirty. I do not like it. You dislike yourself to direct such a thing, do not you? Everybody knows. But please do not treat me as an invisible person. I'm not getting dirty. I only pretend to be clean. The publicist's comforting yourself ... I'm coward. I do not like invisible people. It's hard I want to work with the outside world as a police officer. Everyone is waiting Yeah Police Suspect Sexual Harassment for Female Suspects Furukawa police station detention management system mess Aki wa! Was Furukawa police station information available? Why are you doing this? Why do you ask when you know you will not say? It's a detective. Was not he trying to apologize? "A public official apologizes to the press association for the complaint" Are you here to talk about that? If I apologize, will you withdraw boycott? I do not think so. If it was ruined by a boycott The reporters' association would have already disappeared long ago. I'm going to the bureau. Did you find out where the article went? I think Arakida's director was shed in the Oriental newspaper. Shit, again! What the hell are you doing? I'm the one going back to the main office. I do not want to consume 1 calorie in this village. Yes, you can apologize. To the reporters association Get down or bow down to the spectacular coverage boycott. If you do not accept it, you'll announce your real name. If the tour is well done, we can make it anonymous again. Then you do as you please. Come on, Gumbauka. The dissatisfaction of the Orient is growing. When the publicist apologizes Let's see how many of them will withdraw boycott. If the quorum is filled, tomorrow we will hold a press conference Yeah Do not worry, the publicist's apology is the manager's. Yeah what? Speaking of Meikawa Ryoji ... Meikawa? An old man who died in a traffic accident in a pregnant woman. I learned a lot of things. On the day of the accident, Meikawa was not just drunk To Kurama! Is it important? Is not it important for me and the parties? I'll see you later. Public accountant Sorry about the last night. I was talking about that. I talked to the reporters. Everyone is ordinary people. It's not bad people. I am... I believe in them. I think there is hope. Hope? "The reality is this" "Public Affairs Office is not a window to represent police" This is what the publicist said first. I think I can not open the window just by fighting. The conflict will only get bigger. Trust the reporters. Stop it. I called you. uh! Did you come? What about Akama's chief of staff? I'm afraid. Matsuoka did it. I want to use you as a leader. I have a fight in your secretary's department. The reporters said they were boycotting the report. I will withdraw it. I do not care I pissed off reporters and drove them to boycott. Do I need to do that? Not a lousy sound. Help me for this. I will fight you against Akama and bring you here. Impossible Is it such an attitude while knowing Tokyo's motives? I do not know what you're talking about. It's aimed at depriving me of my position as a detective. The elite from Tokyo. The chief is willing to work on resolving 64 cases. I will speak at the interview. To establish close ties with the Tokyo central government office In my seat I'm going to seat a talented elite group of talent. That's the point. Here's the local police detective. It's going to be Tokyo's subordinate! uh? What happened to the publicist? - Hey, wait! - The publicist! Let go! Wait! Are you ... Mikami? General, I'm sorry. I'll take him out. There's something important. - Just a word ... - You! Ishii is going out. But the general manager ... It's okay, I'd like to hear some live stories from the scene. Okay Yeah, what are you talking about? The chief is coming on Thursday. At that time, I heard that you are going to announce the appointment of the principal. right The criminal department is a big rebound. I think so. Job title is important for any organization. If you push it, you will. I would do more if I did not talk in advance! Why are you using the dragon? The criminal department is in the public eye. I was in the criminal department until spring. With 26 years of experience as a detective ... So, for the sake of justice? Your shoes. I felt so dirty when I came in. Now detectives wear sneakers. Still, a couple of feet fall a year. Oh, right. It's because I want to catch the killer. The detective works with his mind. The pinnacle of that criminal group is the detective general. It is a normal looking up! If you take that top, the detectives will shake. Right... General Manager You have to be greeted. It does not mean that. Interesting. General Manager, stock ... General Manager! Please think again! Press, please. Get out! You got it! Sorry! What did you tell the general manager? Say it! What did you say? Everybody go back to your seat. I heard about Tokyo. He wants to crush the criminal and the local police. Are you aware of that and working together? The police are living creatures. Can you say fat is a province that has lost its criminal director? I get used to it in a month. Stain in two months. Without exception You're a good example. You threw yourself against the reporters in front of the Chief of Staff. It's a great publicist for anyone. - Do not bark! - It's a compliment, do not mistake it. FUTA WATARI, you're in. About 30 women sexual harassment case The police chief apologized at a local police headquarters conference. Police sexual harassment I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience to the citizens. There is a legal basis for an emergency arrest. I will report the fact that I decided to quit my job today. Take this situation seriously and do not let it happen again. About management administration of detention center from today 19 police stations under ... Did your daughter leave the room? Yeah I shook my head. I would like to ask you ... No face! I promise to do my best in the future. With the people To the affected women and others I apologize deeply for your heart. Public Affairs! I always despised you. I have the same trash. Mr. Mikami Kouda? What did you have to see me yesterday? No, that's enough. Yes? But I'm glad to meet you. I'm feeling awake in a long, scary dream now. Where? Hey, coo. Kouda! It's okay? Kouda? Who were you with? no Do not you regret it? What? I married you. I... When I met you, I felt something. I like people. I just want to thank you. I'm just a cop. You were different. People work ... He thought of his work as his own. I've talked to two or three media out of the Orient, but ... Okay, fine. Public Affairs Officer! Where have you been? Sorry, I have a place to stop. The press secretary asked the press association to apologize I've been in some media to open the General Assembly There was no response, and the General Assembly was rejected. It's a big deal. The inspection of the chief is tomorrow morning ... That's about it. Trying to resolve the anonymity problem ... The decision? Yes Let's finish Did not Mr. Kouda come out? Mr. Koda will stay tomorrow. Yeah? It's late. late It's not your fault. The publicist will not care. What happens if we leave in the spring, but what remains of us? It's a blind principle. What a mess! - By spring? - is not it? The publicist is a temporary resident. We're in the head of our criminal department. The 64th case inspection is the gimmick. Mr. Araki is a detective I told him to boycott the coverage. I refused. I do not want to go back to the criminal department! Okay, I understand the public accountant's determination. Think realistic! I have to apologize to withdraw boycott. I'll do it for you. Kurama will also like Mikumo The anonymous problem is blurred and everyone will kneel! I am... I agree with you. It is better to blind anonymity I think so, too. I'll kneel together. Boycott. Whether or not it's withdrawn. then... Public Affairs Officer! Do you think you can believe it? Association reporters ... Suwa I did not hear them now. I'll be in the next room. I have a story to tell you. Wait a minute You can not do this, you know what you're talking about. You're not boycotting. - No ... - Okay. - Hold on. - I do not have time for this. Tsu Fuji! Q! Just listen. Come on! please Everybody, just talk to me! What rights do you have? What the hell's going on? It's an apple. It's not an apple. So what? To convey a new policy of anonymity New policy? - What ... - It's just ... Everyone's got it. Say what you want to say. In the future, the announcement of the Ministry of Public Information is based on the principle of blindness What is the condition? none Will you withdraw boycott? There is no condition, of course I do not expect it. But that's not a condition. What kind of wind did you blow? I believe in the conscience of each press. It's a thoughtful decision. Who is judgment? Are you the chief of police? No, it's my judgment. Then "No" on the top, you can reverse it? no What does it mean to have principles and elasticity? In some cases, anonymity is agreed upon with the press association. Do we agree? Explain it easily. What is it? I do not tell anyone the name of the rape victim. I do not want to announce my name and address. This all agreed! We do not push you, but you want us to think! It's a theme. In the end, it's trying to brainwash us. We can not accept it if it is not in principle. Hey awhile There's something to think about. Yeah, it's not a denial. The blind principle is a big step forward. I can talk. If the publicist gets out like this, we should review it. Yes Let's talk about it. I have to open a general meeting. Yes, open up. Previously! Show me evidence. evidence? I said blindness, but I can not believe it. Prove it now! Oito City traffic accident Please announce the name and address of the pregnant woman here! Madoka, that's over. I'm not done! I did not announce the name of the pregnant woman. It's strange that I leave this as it is. But ... right - Yeah. - Tell me your blind! Announce! If blindness is the principle, it does not make sense! Then each press is! Ask the Public Affairs Office to announce the blindness of pregnant women Is there an objection? - No objection! - No! You see? I can do anything with words. First of all, show me your patience. Good Accept - Press officer ... - I'll get the materials. Wait Press officer, wait! Public Affairs Officer! Public Affairs Officer! Go to the Public Safety Commission and you're in one room. - You're wrong ... - That's the problem now! Public accountant I was short on believing in reporters. This window can not be opened inside. I have to go out to open it! Public accountant Please When you do this, you're really thirsty . I am... Continue to continue ...
