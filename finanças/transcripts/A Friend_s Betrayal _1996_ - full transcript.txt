[serene music] CINDY: How much longer? PAUL: Almost got it. CINDY: Our parents aren't going to be gone all day, you know. I'm just waiting for the light to be perfect. OK. What do you think? It's nice. All right. Here we go. All right. [moans] [phone ringing] Um-- [giggles] Maybe you should get that? Nah, just let it ring. [phone ringing] It could-- it could be your parents or something. Hello. Dennis. PAUL (ON PHONE): No, this is Paul. Paul. Oh, Paul. Hi, it's Nina, Nina Talbot. Hey, how are you doing? I've been better. Is your mom around? No, she's not. [sighs] She's not, huh? Hm, could you give her a message for me? PAUL (ON PHONE): Sure. Who was it. It was a friend of my mom's. Her mother just died. [knocking] Hi. Hi, sweetie. I am so sorry to hear about your mother. You're late. Well, I got here as soon as I could. I called a cab. Well, you didn't have to do that. I didn't want to miss my plane. My car is right out front. I told you, I called a cab. So go cancel the dumb cab. Damn it, Robert. You were supposed to be here half an hour ago. I'm sorry, sweetie. Something came up. [sighs] Let me guess. Karen called one of the kids? [intercom ringing] CAB DRIVER (ON INTERCOM): The meter's running, lady. I got to go. If you take all this-- Paul-- Oh, OK, all right. OK. OK, you guys come look at this. Ah! Isn't that incredible? Come help your mother here. Just what we needed. - Come on, get out of here. - Thank you. Whoa! [chuckles] [chatter] - Uh-huh. - Oh, man. Put it down. [chuckles] Where did you guys get that? In an antique yard. Isn't it incredible? - Thanks. You guys put this together yourself? Uh, me? No. - Him, yes. [giggles] Uh, Nina Talbot called. Nina? Yeah. How's she doing? Not so good. Uh, her mother died. [ominous music] DENNIS: When? PAUL: Today, I guess. Uh, she said she's catching a flight out tonight. She'll be here tomorrow. Evelyn's dead. God. I can't believe it. [sighs] ANNOUNCER (ON INTERCOM): Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 194 from New York's LaGuardia Airport has arrived at gate 3. Flight 194 from New York's LaGuardia Airport has arrived at gate 3. [chuckles] You didn't have to meet the plane. I wasn't sure I had the right flight. Look at you. Oh, Nina, I'm so sorry. It's OK. It's OK. OK, we'll pick you up about 6:30. No, there's no need. I've got mother's car. No, no, no, it's no problem. [car beeping] [suspenseful music] [sobs] [knocking] NINA: Coming. [suspenseful music] Yes? Uh, my mom asked me to pick you up. Paul? Yeah. Wow, you changed. [chuckles] It's been too long. Yes, it has. Come on in. Thanks. Oh, this is a nice place. Thanks. I'll get my stuff. OK. How long are you staying? A week or two. I have to handle mother's affairs, put the house on the market, box up her things. Ooh, that'll be hard. All those memories. NINA: Part of me wants to put everything in boxes and call Goodwill. God, isn't that awful? No, I know what you mean. There's so much, it must be overwhelming. Paul can give you a hand. May I? Paul? Sorry. Stuff you completely forgot about. Nina, how's your work going? Yeah, mom said you won a Grammy. Yeah. Best album cover. That is so awesome. Yeah, now she has something in common with Snoop Puppy Dog, huh? Dad. Doggy Dogg. And that was for, uh, "Hibernation," right? Yeah. Do you listen to the Cage Bears? Listen to them? I love them! You have any idea what they want? Yeah, something with bears, obviously, but that was about it. ELLA: So what did you do? [suspenseful music] I tried about 20 things before. Uh, nothing was really happening. And, finally, I just lay down on the couch, and I listened to the album. Then it hit me. It's the coolest picture. NINA: Yeah, I liked how it seemed to-- to capture the music. On the surface, the songs are really harsh and abrasive. But-- --there's a calm center to them, kind of a stillness. Well, that's what I got out of it. Exactly. [serene music] [beeping] [knocking] Hey. Hey. Come on in. Not too messy for a guy's room. I know your mom, she really put you on the spot. I know. Wow, these are great. Did you take these? PAUL: Yeah. NINA: I know photographers in New York who don't do work half this good. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Yeah, the light, it's hypnotic. Yeah, I'm, uh-- I got this thing about the light. I don't know, it's what draws me in when I take a picture. It's the light, the energy. Well, it's wonderful. Thanks. Um, as I was saying, your mom, she put you on the spot down there. And I'm sure you have better things to do than to help me pack boxes, so-- No, no, I'd-- I'd be happy to. Really? Absolutely. Well, good. I could use the help. So call me when you've got a free afternoon. All right. Good night. [somber music] I need a drink. I got it covered. Good girl. Oh, good, nice. - OK. Smooth. Very smooth. Very smooth. [chuckling] It's a good thing I'm not driving. Now I know why you live in New York. [laughter] As I recall, you're the one who taught me to drive. Yeah? Mm-hmm. So who is this Robert? You come with me. So? Well, familiarity always breeds contempt. Was he a client? Huh, worse. A priest? [laughter] We're sick. Married. Oh, Nina. With a couple of kids. Oh. Did you find out after? No, I knew before, but he was separated. [sighs] I know it's just a matter of time, though, before he's going to go back. He's crazy about his kids. Anyway, I broke it off, and-- I know, why do I do this to myself? No, why? Your father abandoned you, your mother was a recluse. It's a wonder you're not more screwed up than you are. [laughter] Well, I guess I have you to thank for that. Me? [uplifting music] Yeah, you. You've always been my rock. My surrogate, big sister. Oh, Abby, I'm so sick of New York. When I come here, I see how you and Dennis live. You're a perfect family. Not. I envy you. Oh, come on, you have a great life. You have a dream career. You-- you travel. My last vacation was a builder's convention in Reno two years ago. (CHUCKLING) Oh, Reno? Yeah, Reno. [chuckles] Oh! Yeah, you're right, I've made my choices. And they've been good ones. Most of them. But sometimes it gets lonely. Well, that's one thing about having kids, you don't get lonely. Well, I don't really think kids are in my blueprint. Do you ever think about leaving New York? All the time. I've got a good reputation. I could probably live anywhere if I stay freelance. If? Yeah, the security of a firm is tempting. Actually, there's a firm in San Francisco that I've been talking to, and they made me an offer. Yeah? You might take it? I don't know. I'm going to go meet with them while I'm here. All right. [sighs] [school bell ringing] STUDENT 1: All right, I'll see you in 10. STUDENT 2: Gabby, wait up! No, I promised one of my mom's friends I'd help her pack up some stuff. [scoffs] A friend of your mom? She's really cool. She's a graphic designer. She used to live in New York. And she does like CD covers and stuff like that. You know that Cage Bears, "Hibernation" album? Yeah. She did that album. Get out of here. I swear. Bet she gets a-- a lot of free CDs, you know promos, stuff like that? Uh-- Or maybe she can cut us in on it a deal. Think about it. See you later, Gulliver. Paul. Hey, Mr. Franks. Glad I ran into you. You got a minute? Yeah, sure. Did St. Hope send you next year's course catalog yet? Yeah, I think so. All right. I know you're going premed, but-- Uh, Mr. Franks, actually I haven't, um, made up my mind yet. I thought you were pre-med all the way. Here grab a seat. I mean about Stanhope. Really? I thought, you know, with your early acceptance and everything. Have you applied somewhere else? No, I'm just-- I'm not real sure about, uh, college. I mean, right now. I was thinking of maybe taking a year off. And do what? I don't know. I've just been spending so much time thinking about college and Stanhope and Paul Hewitt, M.D. I-- I'm just not sure if it's what I want anymore. Did you talk to your parents about this? [chuckles] Yeah. They didn't really understand. They were pretty upset. I bet they are. Well, you going to Stanhope's always been their dream. Look, Paul, you're a smart kid. You're going to land on your feet no matter what you do, but I hope you give this some serious thought. Stanhope's a good school. My mom called you, didn't she? Yeah, she did. You always told me to make up my own mind, and this is my decision. And I want you to make the right decision. Look, I'm sorry you and dad had to drop out of college, all right? But if I go, I'm going to go-- If? Can I finish? If I go, I'm going to go because I want to go, not because you want me to. [sighs] Is that what this is about? You don't want to go because it's what we want? [sighs] No, that's not what this is about. I'm late. I got to go. [sighs] [phone ringing] Hello? ROBERT (ON PHONE): Hello, Nina, is that you? Robert. How did you get this number? ROBERT (ON PHONE): Listen, Nina, I have some good news. I've been doing a lot of thinking. I've come to a decision. You made a decision, well, good. But I told you, Robert, I don't want to talk to you about this anymore. ROBERT (ON PHONE): I filed for divorce. I served Caroline with the papers yesterday. You what? ROBERT (ON PHONE): I'm sorry it took me so long to come to my senses, Nina. But now we can be together like we planned. That is insane. I never said any-- [dramatic music] [knocking] I never said such a thing. ROBERT (ON PHONE): For 10 months, it's all we talked about. Now that I've done it, don't back away. Don't lose your trust in me. I can't talk about this right now. And it's not a matter of distrusting you. I just don't want this anymore. ROBERT (ON PHONE): How can you say that? Come on, Nina, you've always been afraid of commitment. I know it's scary, but you've got to try. I am not scared, Robert. I'm not. It's over. All right? It's over! ROBERT (ON PHONE): It's not over. You know it is. And if I were there right now holding you in my arms, you wouldn't be saying that. I love you, Nina. I want us to be together. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and that's what you want, too. Well, that's just too bad. That's just too damn bad. Are you OK? [sobs] I'm sorry. That's OK. I should get dressed. [dance music] Oh, man! What? This can't be my mom. Oh, god. Oh, god. [chuckles] Yeah, the disco years. [chuckles] That is wild. Yeah, she was wild. Get out of here, really? No, she was actually pretty straight. Boy, she knew where she was headed and why she wanted even then. Yeah, only she never got it. [sensual music] No, but I guess that sometimes knowing what you want isn't always enough. I don't know. I kind of think it's dangerous to know what you want. I think it can cut you off from other things. That's true. Life doesn't always move in a straight progression. And sometimes, no matter how much you plan, it doesn't turn out like you pictured it. Well, that's fine, as long as you're open to that and not afraid of it. Yeah, got to listen to the muse. The what? Muse. Oh, I call mine Crazy Annie. Um, inspiration. The voice in your head that tells you that things are getting cozy and predictable, and you got to shake it up because boredom is the eighth deadly sin. [chuckles] So when that voice starts to scream, I've got to listen to it. I've got to do something fast because if I don't, I'm going to go crazy. And it is not going to shut up. Well, I definitely got one of those. Good. Listen to it. It'll take you to amazing places. Hey. Hey. I came by to see you, and I got a free dinner. Sorry. I was, uh-- I know. You were helping your mom's friend pack up some stuff. You're such a sweetheart. Um, Paul, I was talking to your mom and dad. And this whole thing about not wanting to go away for school, is it because of me? What do you mean? Are you worried about us being so far apart next year? No. No, I'm not worried about that. I mean, even if you do stay here next year, I'm going to be at UCLA, so we probably wouldn't see each any more often than we would if you were at Stanhope. What if I came to UCLA with you? What? You mean, like, go to school there? No, I mean come live there in your dorm or whatever. Living together? What do you-- I-- I've always thought about a career in photography. I mean, I've got tons of great stuff. I can just throw together a portfolio and make the rounds. Sounds great, I guess. I mean-- And there's tons of opportunity in LA. But, sure, I'd have to be an apprentice for a little while, but it's no big deal. You're serious. Sure. Just blow off med school? Just like that? Maybe. I don't know. I-- I just have this gut feeling that once I start pre-med, I'll, uh, just never get out of it. But that's what you wanted. Is it? Yeah. [sighs] Look, Paul, whatever you want to do is fine with me. You know that. [serene music] Come here. [knocking] Paul? Paul. Paul? [uplifting music] Since your mother doesn't have a headstone, I thought you might like this. Paul. ABBY: Having you around like this is a lot more fun than just talking on the phone twice a year. WOMAN: That'd be great, ma'am. ABBY: Oh, that's gorgeous. Mm, this one, you think? Yeah. Abby, did you know about the picture that Paul gave me? Oh, yeah, I did see that. That was so sweet. He is such a great kid. I think so. I am worried about him, though. NINA: Why? Oh, he's scheduled to go to Stanhope next fall. And now he's thinking of not going. Really? Why? I don't know. Huh. I hate you. [giggles] Then I'm buying it. Why don't you and Dennis take him to the campus and show him around? We offered, he's not interested. That's too bad. It's such a great place. Uh, I just had a crazy idea. What? Oh, no, forget it. What? What if Paul went with you when you go to San Francisco for your meeting? What if you showed him the campus? Oh, gee, I don't know if he'll-- We would pay all of his expenses. And I-- I don't want to impose, but he likes you. No, it's not an imposition. You know, you two seem to speak the same language. God knows he and I haven't been communicating lately. Well, I suppose I could say an extra day. Is this a dumb idea? No. No, it's a great idea. She's going up Friday. And she's coming back Sunday. Mm-hmm. Look, I know you haven't made up your mind, and we're OK with that. Good. We're just saying go, check it out, see what you think. You guys sound just like Mr. Franks, you know that? I'll go. Go where? What's up? Paul's going to San Francisco with Nina. ELLA: San Francisco? I'm just going to check out the campus. Oh, I am so jealous. DENNIS: Ella. Great. Now I want to go even more. DENNIS: [chuckles] I'll see you guys later. So long. [tram bell ringing] [chatter] Welcome, sir. Welcome, ma'am. I'll take that. Thanks. [uplifting music] [knocking] Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Hey. Hi. [chuckles] Oh, how is it? Oh, it's great. Good. Now come check this out. Oh, look at this. Champagne, pistachios, pate. Where's the chocolate? Oh, no. No chocolate. Now they have to do better than that if they expect me to take this job. [chuckles] Oh, I got to get a move on. See you. Thanks. [sensual music] [knocking] Hi. Hey. All right, I'm out of here. Live it up. You know, room service, pay-per-view, whatever, it's on them. All right. Uh, So what? A couple hours? Uh, well, after they impress the hell out of me with their offices, they're going to take me to dinner, so 9:00, 10:00. Good luck. Thanks. [uplifting music] [chatter] [tram bell ringing] 6. [knocking] There you are. Voila. Now your basket's complete. [chuckles] Aw! Uh, so how did it go? What? - Your meeting. - Oh. You know, dinner. Good, good. Red carpet all the way. What can I say, they are crazy about me. [chuckles] [sensual music] Well, I'm, uh, I'm going to turn in, so-- Oh, yeah, sure. No problem. Good night. Good night. See you tomorrow. [knocking] Yes? Uh, yeah, just a small finder's fee. good night. Good night. [chatter] All right, well, um, I looked at this, this morning. I was very surprised. It seems to be a little different. I mean, but you authorized it? Yeah, well, the way the light comes in here the-- the square corners just make it harsh. The round corners soften it. You can't authorize blueprint alterations. It's not going to cost you another penny. Dennis, that's not the point. That's my vision you're screwing with out there. And I won't tolerate it. OK. Jerk. Hey, it's his show. I'm just a contractor. Yeah, well, that doesn't give him the right to-- Come on, the forms. Thanks. [phone ringing] Contracting. PAUL (ON PHONE): Mom? Paul, how's it going? Oh, great, mom. It's going really great. ABBY (ON PHONE): Did you get a chance to see the director of admissions yet? Yeah, I saw him this morning. We've been here most of the day. The campus is really beautiful, really. Sounds like you like it. PAUL (ON PHONE): I do. It's amazing. We're having a blast. ABBY (ON PHONE): Can't wait to hear all about it. PAUL (ON PHONE): I love you, mom. Yeah, you too. Say hi to Nina for us. PAUL (ON PHONE): All right, mom. Bye-bye. Your wife is so smart. [uplifting music] Paul Hewitt having a blast. [chuckles] All right, enough. [chuckles] OK. Need some help? Yeah, thanks. PAUL: Nice. Nice. The most important discoveries here were done. He's great, you know? Wait, slow down, slow down. Come on, come on, come on. Stop. Nice and easy. If you're going to feature us, then I suppose you should feature both of us. Now. Mm. Perfect. Perfect. NINA: I loved school, but the one thing that I regret was I didn't spend enough time traveling beforehand. And there's so much that you learn about yourself and people and where you want to live that you cannot get in that controlled institution-- Yeah, but you get to travel a lot now, don't you? NINA: Yeah, it's what I love about my work. As a matter of fact, the last time I was here, your mom and I had-- [uplifting music] OK. It's freezing. Let's go. - One more. - No. - Come on, it's beautiful. Come on, you're going to run out of film. You probably already are out of film. It's late. Come on. Let's go. I'm so cold, OK? Uh, wait up. Forgot this. Thanks. - Great. - You got it? Yeah. [chuckles] There's some soda in the refrigerator if you'd like one? No, thanks. [sensual music] Uh, maybe some dinner? No. Actually, uh-- I'd rather just stay here with you. Paul, no. Oh. [moans] Don't. [moans] Hey. Hi. PAUL: What time is it? It's early. Why don't you come back to bed? [serene music] You're so beautiful. Don't. Just hold me. ANNOUNCER (ON INTERCOM): Chris Skycapp, please respond to agent at gate 12. Hi, welcome home. Mm. Hey. Hi. Missed you too. - Oh, let me get your bags. - Oh, no. No, I got it. I got it. Give you break. How was the flight? - What did I bring you? - Great. That's all they had to ask me. Here we go. Very cool. I got a hat. ABBY: Oh, a chocolate, great. Thank you. Oh, you're awake. Cindy called. But you're not going anywhere until you tell me everything. DENNIS: Ella, give me that platter? What? About Stanhope. Oh, um, I liked it. But, yesterday, you sounded pretty fired up about it. Did I? [school bell ringing] I called you last night. Didn't you get my message? No, sorry. So how was your trip? It was good. Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. Well, my parents are going to some benefits thing, so can you come over? Sure. Great. I'll see you later. I don't know if he's going to be accepted or not. Hi, Cindy. Bye, Cindy. Oh, how was Frisco, big guy? It was cool. Did you check out the strip clubs in North Beach like I told you to? No, man, I missed them. Oh, man, you visit Sin City and you act like a monk. What's wrong with you? Nothing. ABBY: But I thought the meeting went well. It did, I'm just not ready to leave New York. So when are you going back? Soon. Oh, that's too bad. I got us tickets to the Long Beach Jazz Festival. And I was arranging a dinner party and-- Without asking me? I just assumed that you-- Well, I am sorry if I messed up your plans. So tell me about Stanhope. You think Paul liked it? Uh, yeah, I think he did. ABBY: I can't tell. He is real hard to read these days. NINA: Well, you know, I-- I think that he did like it, but-- What? I think he's losing interest in being a doctor. He told you that? No. It's a feeling that I have. He's a really good photographer. What does that have to do with anything? That's where his heart is. No, it's just a hobby. [scoffs] Yeah, and hobbies can lead to great careers. Look where my doodling took me. Paul could be a really fine photographer. He could do anything he set his mind to, but-- Then why not let him? I think I know what's best for Paul, Nina. Maybe not. Sometimes a parent, who is so involved in the situation, can't always tell what's best for the child. How would you know? Did Nina say why? She wants to get back to New York. When does she go? Couple of days. DENNIS: Well, I guess she couldn't stay forever. Can I be excused? Are you going out? I'm just going to go to Cindy's and study. Hey, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. - Say hi to Cindy. - So long. PAUL: See you. ABBY: Weird. [rock music] So what should we study first? What? [sighs] What? You just don't seem very interested. No, I-- I don't know. Paul, what's wrong? I got to go. W-- wait. You just got here. Yes, I'll call you tomorrow, OK? Where are you-- I'll call you tomorrow. Wait a second. Can you wait? Paul? [knocking] You shouldn't have come here. Why are you leaving? I want you to go home. No. Look, Paul what happened was great, but we cannot-- [sensual music] [suspenseful music] PAUL: Wait. Give me a second. Stop it. We're going to get in trouble. [hushed whispering] Oh, you're driving me crazy. [laughs] Abby. Mom. Mom. - Go home, Paul. - Mom. ABBY: I'll talk to you later. Now! I'll wait for you downstairs. Oh, god. I'm so sorry. You bitch! I didn't mean for this to happen. It just did. - No, don't! Don't you dare try to explain this to me. I should have you arrested. And if you see Paul again, if you talk to him again, I will. I swear to God, I will. That's right. There's only one side of the story, Abby's side. You don't even know why he was here. Get out of my way! [sighs] Is Paul upstairs? Yes, he's in his room. He stormed in a little while-- Abby, what's going on? Abby! [knocking] Come in. This isn't your fault. Nina is a very seductive woman. She didn't seduce me, mom. I've known her most of my life, Paul. I know how she operates. Nina and I like each other. We like spending time together. What's wrong with that? Everything is wrong with that. I don't think so. You can't stop me from seeing her. As long as you're living in this house, I can, and I will. What the hell is going on? Where's Ella? DENNIS: What? She's down in the den watching TV. What's going on? ABBY: Paul's sleeping with Nina. What? He was just over there tonight. Oh, for god's sake. I think we should call the police. The police? He's just a boy, Dennis. It's statutory rape. DENNIS: Abby, he's 18 years old. Well, we got to do something. Well, isn't she going back to New York? You're not upset at this, are you? Of course, I am. Paul's sleeping with Nina. It's shocking, it's-- it's inappropriate, but it's not wrong, is it? I didn't say that. Of course, it's wrong. He didn't want to pass up an opportunity to get a little. Stop it. So what if he completely screws up his life. He's just doing what a guy's got to do, right? [door slamming] [dramatic music] DENNIS: Paul. Paul! ABBY: Where are you going? If I can't see Nina as long as I'm living here, I don't want to live here anymore. Paul, don't you dare leave! Paul! Un-freaking-believable. [chuckles] Gulliver, you got to promise me you're not going to tell anybody. No, I promise. PAUL: No, really. Of course, I promise. PAUL: [sighs] Man, she's incredible. I've never met anybody like her. So, um, does she know all kinds of tricks and stuff, or what? I'm just asking. No, it's not about the sex. I'm telling you. So much more to it than that. Oh, w-- wait, so what? You're, like, in love with her? [sighs] I don't know. It's definitely not like it is with Cindy, though. So what are you going to do? She's going back to New York. Are you going to go with her? I don't know. Everything's changed. Everything. DENNIS: Was Paul here? No. Do you know where he is? I haven't seen him since last night. Abby told me about last night. Well, if you came here to read me the Riot Act, you can save your breath. She already did that. Abby has a right to be upset, Nina, and so do I. So be upset. He's a kid! He's a lot more together than most adults I know. What were you thinking? I wasn't thinking, OK? [serene music] I spent time with somebody who was really terrific and passionate and fun. And I went with it. You know what that's like, Dennis, don't you? Or have you forgotten? No. No, I haven't forgotten. Stay away from him, Nina. Or what? If he comes by, tell him his mother and I want to see him. I want to know what's going on. [sighs] I don't have time to talk right now. Why did you run out on me like that last night? I'm going to be late for class. Paul, can we just talk-- Would you just leave me alone, OK? [car approaching] Hey. I was coming to look for you. I, uh, I moved out. I'm staying with a friend. [sighs] Look, I just want you to know that I don't feel bad about anything. I-- I don't. I mean, you're-- you're terrific. I-- I just wanted you to know that before you went back to New York. [dramatic music] I'm not going back. Why not? Going back to New York is just running away, and I don't want to do that. [sensual music] I don't care what Abby or Dennis or anybody thinks. It's nobody's business who I spend my time with. And I want to spend it with you. So what are you saying? I'm saying you're the sweetest, most wonderful thing that's happened to me in a long time. I want us to be together. Well, we can't stay here, that's for sure. Every time I open a closet, I think my mother's going to jump out. [chuckling] So what's your place like in New York? Mm, it's a big loft. Really? You know, I heard they're, uh. Converting old warehouses into lofts downtown. Maybe we could get one of those. Yeah, well, I guess we could take a look. Think about it. Like, a place with a lot of light. I could build a darkroom. You make it sound so easy. Well, it is. Is it? Yes, it is. [giggles] Oh. I'll show you easy. [chuckling] Ella! Come on, kiddo, we're going to be late. Dennis, I need to talk to you. Why don't you give us a second? I just spoke to Gulliver. And? Paul's moving in with Nina. She's not going back to New York. [sighs] Well, at least they're not running away together. Damn it, Dennis, is that the best you can do? Let's be smart here. I mean, we tried tough love and that didn't work. Psych 101, the more we try to keep them apart, the more they're going to want to be together. Well, what are we supposed to do? Stand around and do nothing while she ruins his life? Look, Paul's a terrific kid, not least because we've had him for 18 years. And if we've done as good a job as I think we have, he'll-- he'll come around. He's not going to want to keep playing house with her. Well, you'd know, wouldn't you? What? He's thinking with his crotch, Dennis. That wipes out 18 years. That wipes out everything. Look at us. Where would we be if we'd been thinking instead of sleeping together in 1978? Right here, I hope, together with two great kids. We have a good life, Abby. It could have been a whole lot better. Paul's not coming home, is he? Well, it's kind of complicated. Paul and Nina care about each other. What's so wrong with that? It just is, sweetheart. You just don't understand how complicated-- Right, because I'm a kid and you're the adult, right? Well, adults are supposed to make things better, not worse. We're not making it worse. Well, you're not making it better, are you? [chatter] Bastard! [somber music] Hey, there's Paul. Hey. Oh, hey, uh. - Oh! - Watch it! - Ow! - Oh! Oh! [complaining] You told everybody. Let go of me, man. - You promised me. - What? Do you think people weren't going to find out? I thought this is, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to you. Hey, hey, break it up, break it up. Both of you. Just chill out, man. Damn. Hey. Hi. I didn't think you'd be home. I just came by to pick up some extra stuff. You're still over at Nina's? Yeah, we're looking to get our own place together. Are you? You know, uh, it's Ella's birthday on Saturday. We're having a party. It would mean the world to her if you'd come. Is Nina invited? I don't think your mother would like that. Then I can't come. Paul, you cannot blame her for being upset. I mean, dammit, you're sleeping with her best friend. Look, she's got some old issues to work out, but she's-- all her-- her hopes for you, her plans. Look, dad, I can't live mom's life for her. No, no, but you can consider her feelings. Look, I think you're making a terrible mistake here. You're-- you're setting things in motion that you-- you just have no idea about. But it is your decision, and-- and you just have to live with the consequences. Whatever happens, this is your home. Always will be. Remember that. Thanks, Dad. [uplifting music] [sighs] [knocking] Come on in, it's open. Hello, Nina. What are you doing here? Are you surprised? You didn't think I was going to let you just disappear out of my life forever, did you? I am not part of your life, Robert, not anymore. Hey, listen, I left Karen for you. I'm divorcing her. Well, I didn't ask you to do that. I thought that's what you wanted. [door opening] Maybe a long time ago, but we're way past that now. Hey. Hey. Um, this is Robert, an old friend. How do you do? Hi. [suspenseful music] Robert and I have some business that we have to discuss. You know, the night I met you a little voice inside me said this woman's trouble, Robert. You know, you should walk away from her now and fast. And I wish to god I had. How old is that boy, anyway? Do you even care? I want you to leave. Did he leave his family for you? Did you break a few more hearts just to sweeten the pot? You broke Karen's heart, Robert. And you would have broken mine. Now get out of my house. You're sick, Nina. [sighs] Hungry? I thought you said it was over with Robert. It is. You said he would never leave his wife, and that's why you broke up with him. Yes. But-- but now he's divorcing her. So? So are you guys getting back together or what? Of course, not. [sighs] Well, he sure must think so to come all the way out here. People believe what they want to, Paul, even if it isn't true. Maybe that's what we're doing. What do you mean? Maybe we're just pretending this is going to work and, uh, it isn't. [sensual music] Is that pretend? Is it? [chatter] [rock music] What about this? It's kind of slutty. [scoffs] So should I try it on? Ella? Look, I'll be back in a minute, OK? Sure. Hey, Nina. Ella, hi. I didn't know you shopped here. Just browsing. Yeah, me too. How are you? Great. Good. Listen, I'm glad I ran into you because mom and dad are throwing me this, like, massive party Saturday afternoon. It's, like, probably going to be really lame, but I'd like you guys to come, you and Paul. Abby wouldn't like it, Ella. No, actually I talked to her. And she said it would be OK. Really? Well, yeah, I mean she's still a little weirded out about you and Paul, but, I mean, she said this is only, like, my most important birthday in the whole world, so she said it would be like a cease-fire or something. Are you sure? Look, I was going to call you tonight. I'll talk to Paul. Great. Ella? Look, I've got to get going, but I guess I'll see you on Saturday. We'll see. OK. Bye. Bye. What are you doing? It's OK. [door opening] Hey. Hey. Oh, let me guess. Car parts. I've been living out of a suitcase. So then why don't we just take a little trip to New York and pick up the rest of your stuff? Oh, I think you just want a free trip. Ah. Busted. Speaking of busted, I ran into Ella. Really? How is she? She's going to be 16 on Saturday. And there's a party. Yeah, I know. Um, my dad told me. Huh, are you going? Mm, I don't know. Well, Ella invited me, I mean, us. She said that Abby's willing to lay down the sword, at least for that afternoon. Really? So do you want to go? I don't know. I'm not so sure it's the best time for a family reunion. Well, we can't spend the rest of our lives avoiding my family. Maybe this is just my mom's way of patching things up without losing face. I don't know, but you should go. You know how much it would mean to Ella. No. No, we're in this together. I'm not going unless you go with me. Let me think about it, OK? Sure. [rock music] [chatting, laughter] Hi. Hi, Heather. Hi, Karina. Hi. OK. Michael, what were you doing upstairs? Get out there. You're just starting those now? I love you, too. Hurry up! Hey. Ella! Oh, Heather, hi! I'm so glad you came. (SINGING) Yes, I know what I'm talking about. Yes, I know what I'm talking about. You need more than that. Yeah, I need more, yeah. Cindy, honey, could you give me a hand here? (SINGING) I can't make it no more. Got to get back out the door. I didn't break it-- I need you to help me with cake and candles. I'm going to find, Ella. Oh, all right. - Pretty. - Think we have enough of these? ABBY: Oh, we do. (SINGING) Bam! Bam! I'm talking to you. What? You look like you just saw a ghost. I did. Hey, happy birthday. Oh! You came! Oh! Oh, I missed you. I missed you, too. What? Look who's here. I'll be damned. You got to open this present. Oh! I'm telling you, it's the best one I've gotten you. Oh, sweet heart. I'm so glad you showed up. Thank you. PAUL: Uh, you're welcome. Hey, Dad. - Hey, pal. - How's it going? It's good to see you. Good to see you, too. DENNIS: Glad you made it. What are you doing here? Get the hell out of here! Abby. Get out of here! ELLA: No! No! No! I invited her. You invited her? Why? To humiliate me? ELLA: No, of course, not. Why would I? You're not welcome here. Not now, not ever. I'm sorry. [sobs] Ella. Honey? Ella? Thanks a lot, Mom. I want to talk to you. Ella, what's going on? I hate her. I hate her! Ella! Wait a sec. I'll go get her, OK? Stay here. I can't believe that bitch ruined Ella's party. She didn't ruin anything. You attacked her in front of everyone. Oh, that's right! Take her side! I'm taking Ella's side. This is Ella's party. I will not have that woman in my house! [arguing] CINDY: Ella. Ella? [sobs] CINDY: Will you wait a second? Ella. Ella! Ella, can you just wait a second? Ella. Ella, hold on. Wait. Hey, Ella? [dramatic music] [hooting] [breaks screeching] [smashing] Ella! [somber music] Where's ICU? RECEPTION (ON INTERCOM): Dr. Walker, please report to maternity. Nurse Britt, please, dial the operator. Nurse Britt, please, dial the operator. WOMAN: I think he came in about 20 minutes ago. [chatter] PAUL: How is she? We don't know yet, but they're hopeful. RECEPTION (ON INTERCOM): Dr. Hunt, please report to third-floor nurse's station. MAN: I'll go down and talk to his parents. How's Ella? [sighs] She's, uh, she's going to be OK. She bruised her collarbone and broke one of her legs, but, um, she was pretty lucky. I'm-- I'm real tired. I'm going to head upstairs. [somber music] What are you doing here? We have to talk. There's nothing to talk about. I'm not leaving until we do. Five minutes. Well? Well-- well, things have gotten pretty screwed up, haven't they? What did you expect? Not this, Abby. I never expected any of this. Yeah, you never meant for this to happen. You never do. No, of course, not, but that doesn't mean that you and I shouldn't-- Tell me something, Nina. Did you go after Paul for the sheer perversity of it? Or was it a chance to get back at me for Dennis? What? That summer after my sophomore year, you think I don't know what happened? I-- I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, sure you do. I went to San Diego for a long weekend. And while I was gone, you slept with my boyfriend. Dennis told you? No, he didn't have to. God, I could practically smell him on you when I got back. I didn't think you knew. Yeah, and you're still in the same rut, aren't you, Nina? Still starting affairs that can't possibly go anywhere. Or if they do have a future, finding a way to ruin them. Well, you ruined that one for me, Abby. What? By getting pregnant? Give me a break. Getting pregnant changed my whole life. You think that it's me you're mad at, but it isn't, it's you. You were always beating yourself up for the great life that you think you missed out on. Well, you had better get over it and fast or you are going to miss the great life that you have now. Don't you lecture me about my life. You don't have any sense of my reality or anybody else's. You do what you want, you go where you please. You think that makes you strong. You don't connect with anybody, Nina. You're too damn selfish. NINA: Oh, that is so unfair. ABBY: Are you thinking about Paul at all? About how he's going to feel when you get tired of him because you will? Yeah, you think I'm pissed off about my life. Yeah, maybe I am sometimes. But I love my family, and I love my son. Who do you love, Nina? That feels like five minutes to me. [sighs] That was great. Liar. Cooking is not my best feature. Well, you could have fooled me. Close your eyes. What for? Just close them. Well, I've got something for you. Come on, really? Yes. I'm not going to give it to you if you don't close them. OK. They're closed. OK, you can open them. Open it. [sensual music] PAUL: [sighs] Oh, man. I found it in a closet. It must have been my father's. It's beautiful. Well, take beautiful pictures with it. Save some for me. I'm going back to New York. I have a lot of business I have to take care of there. And I'm already going stir crazy here, so-- That's fine. I'll just, uh, go back with you. NINA: No. [scoffs] Why? You don't want me to go with you? This isn't going to work, and you know that. No, uh, I don't. Yeah, the past couple of days have been hard-- And you're thinking about moving home. And that's where you belong. [sighs] [sighs] Sorry. No. Don't you be sorry on my account ever. [uplifting music] [sighs] Sweetie, be careful. Ella, you're doing great. DENNIS: There you go, Ella. Yeah. There you go. Hungry? No. Chicken soup. No. Too much hospital food? [chuckles] Yeah. Here you go. I made these myself. Oh, ooh! [laughter] Right, up. - Ooh-- DENNIS: And-- - --ooh, is that hard? Yeah. DENNIS: --attam. Bingo. OK, put this back. And it'll hurt for-- - OK. - Better? Uh-huh. Yeah? Yeah. [door closing] More in the car? Yeah. I'll get it. [uplifting music] [groans] [sighs] Well, I still don't know what I'm doing. [sighs] I want to be here with you guys. But as far as Stanhope goes, uh, I just don't know. OK. But you got to let me figure it out on my own. Even if I decide to do something that you don't like. I'll try, Paul. Thanks. ABBY: Paul. Yeah? I'm glad you're home. Me too. Hey. Hi. How're you feeling? Oh, better. Better? OK. NINA: I found this among mother's effects and I debated whether to send it to you or not. Remember these two? Braces was going to be a famous artist and Pigtails was going to find a cure for stomach aches. Abby, you asked me who I love. I won't apologize for finding that with Paul, but I do regret the hurt that I caused you and your family. Perhaps one day you will forgive me. Perhaps one day we'll speak again. I had this picture copied and framed. It sits on my desk. Amazing how it brightens the room. Love, Nina. [uplifting music]
