[IMITATING ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [CROWD SCREAMING] [TIRES SCREECHING] - ANNOUNCER: 40 laps. Machin, - Purcelli, McLaren, - Werner, still the same order, - but a new lap record - to Machin of 1:35.5. - One minute, 35.5 seconds. - But now Machin's got - a bunch of slower cars - in front of him. - Purcelli's trying alongside. - Machin pulls over, - he's very close to Purcelli. [TIRES SQUEALING] - Now everybody's - safely around him. - Machin really is forgetting - all the rules today. - And here's the checkered flag - for the finish. - Joe Machin's Lotus - wins the Monaco Grand Prix. - Followed home by McLaren's - Cooper and Werner's Porsche. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] [BAND PLAYING] Shall I come up? Call me later. [PEOPLE CLAPPING] Great race! Great! Great! Great race! Great! Great! He's a great driver. Yeah, and he'll be world champion over anybody's dead body. You took some unnecessary chances today. That curve where Purcelli spun out was a pretty silly... I took the race and that curve. It was my last chance. It could've been your last race. Brother Bob, I'm hard to kill. [RINGING] Do me a favor, will you? Hello? Oh, hello there, honey. How are you? Yeah. Tell Sesia I'm going to take a nap and a shower in your room, huh? What's that? Oh, no, you come right on up. [CHUCKLING] No, just give me time to wash up. Okay, bye-bye. [PHONE BANGING] And, Bob... Why don't you take my wife to that nice little restaurant you both like so much? I'll see you there in a couple of hours. You see, brother? You do me a favor, I do you one. [CHUCKLING] [CALLS IN FRENCH] [RESPONDS IN FRENCH] [ORDERING IN FRENCH] An Americano for a thirsty man? Oh, thank you. Well, now, what arrangements have you made? You have a suite at the Hotel de Paris. Yeah? And there's a typewriter ready whenever you're disposed to use it. Hey, I want to spend a little time with the girl I'm engaged to. Have you seen Monique? [PEOPLE CLAPPING] So, who's the object of all the interest? Today's celebrity, Joseph Machin, winner of the Monaco Grand Prix. Oh, he won! Yeah, I hear he's very good. Is a win that important to you? What's got into you guys? Haven't you ever driven in the turn before? Sure, at the beginning. On the way up, you take chances. We're all Grand Prix now. That means, we figure, we are a club. Well, that's right. I want to be the number-one member. You don't seem to understand. We all, we feel, we pay our dues. And we like to keep the membership as intact as possible. Well, boys, I can only give you one little piece of advice. Go get yourself a scooter! [SPEAKING ANGRILY IN SPANISH] I see by their faces he won't win any popularity contests. They say he's arrogant, ruthless, crude, and altogether a hateful human being. [LAUGHING] What are you doing here? You're drunk! Monique! Coward! Why you never tell me you had a wife? Because you never asked me. But I'm telling you now! But now it's too late. What did you think I was, a tramp? But you mistook yourself. Baby, you are what you are! No. I am what you made me, don't forget that. And you made me very bad. [EXCLAIMS] I'm in love with you! Forget it, baby! The party's over! [LAUGHS] The party's over! My God, I feel I got shot. I want to talk to you later. Oh, Henny. Steve, I was afraid. I wasn't looking for Joe Machin. I was looking for her. She's left Monte Carlo. And now... [EXCLAIMS IN ANGER] I wonder how this happened. I mean, was it the first day or the first week or... Did it happen the day before yesterday? I wanted to see her and ask her. Why? I couldn't find her. Steve, sometimes, in some places, the sea, the moon, the pop of a champagne cork can be corrupters. Or a man. Sometimes a kind of a man can be a corrupter. Hey. Let it alone. Do you want to pursue this thing until it becomes a tragedy? It is a tragedy. When a man takes something that you love, and cherishes it, okay, you can get over that. But when he takes it, uses it, spits on it and throws it away... But what'll be accomplished by a vendetta? Someone has to expose the spoilers. I'll write a book. I'm going to expose this Machin and show that he's a little tin god. I couldn't find him. Don't you ever get tired of waiting for Joe? He's my husband. That's old-world Spanish talking, a code more than half dead. No woman should take what you take from Joe. It's not right that brother should speak against brother. Is it right that I'm supposed to... Well, here I am, you lucky people! Always an entrance. Hey, look who I met! You remember Lea from Madrid. Hello, Mrs. Machin. Hi, Bob. It's been a long time. Yes. You know, she's been taking bullfight lessons. Go on, show him some of those moves. [CALLING IN SPANISH] Come on! Come on! Come on. Come on. You don't seem very enthusiastic about my talent. I don't believe women are supposed to be where they shouldn't be. Oh, Bob, why can't you get along with the ladies? You're healthy, good looking, you got a good education. You know, I try to make him everything I'm not. It's all for nothing. Maybe he'd rather be like you. No, no, he doesn't even respect me. He doesn't like the way I walk, the way I talk, the way I sweat. Notice he never sweats. Something wrong, darling? It's the heat. It oppresses me. Look, I'll drive you. I'll get a taxi. But what's eating you? What, her? Look, we can't very well ignore an old friend, can we? Didn't you get enough of her in Madrid? Well, now, where were we? The ride's over for today. I was told I could find Joseph Machin here. I'm Joe Machin. How do you do? My name is Stephen Children. Well, make yourself comfortable. Let me introduce my brother, Bob, Lea. Hello. Hello. What can we do for you? I'm a writer. Oh, you want to write a story about me, huh? No, a novel. Oh. I want to write a book about a man who wants the world and has only one unusual talent to get it for him. Is that right? Uh-huh. A talent for something dangerous. Like racing cars? Exactly. Like racing cars. Man against machine, man against death. You see, I've been looking a long time for a model. I need a really great racer. I need to know what he feels and thinks about everything. You think I might be that guy? I think you're ideal. Are you sure you want to know about everything? Well, nearly everything. I see. Sort of a biography, huh? Yeah, sort of like a biography. [MOANING] Well, think about it, will you? Sure, sure. It's a great idea. Great idea. [CHURCH BELL TOLLING] Sesia. Were you praying for us? Why don't you return to America? Will you come home with me? That's not possible. It's not right that you should follow me and seek out these out-of-the-way meetings. Is it right that I should love you and never talk about it? It would be better. I've never spoken or touched you in any way. But I've touched you. My hands caress you, not Joe's. My arms protect you, not Joe's. Don't. You are my husband's brother. Why does the name "brother" suggest some idiot purity? Why does a relationship through marriage carry with it a virtue I can't possess? I watch your tears when Joe's been cruel to me. Were those tears only for a brother-in-law? Sometimes tears are wiser than the one who sheds them. Perhaps they were for you. Perhaps for me. And perhaps they were for Joseph. - ANNOUNCER: Three minutes 58.2. - 3:58.2. - Maggs in the other Cooper, - first time here. - 3:59.6. 3:59.6. Trying out your baby carriages? Yes, and the infants that drive them. Steve! Steve Children! Hello, Mr. Lynward, how are you? 1958, Sebring, Florida. Right. Well, what's happened since then? Well, I found my machine. A typewriter. Actually, I'm here doing a book about racing. Good. Anything I can do to help? Yes. You can give me a place as alternate on the team. I'd like to do the rest of the tour with you. Well, that'll be a bit difficult. I know it's an unusual request. We generally book early in the season. I know, but it would be a great favor to me. Kept your hand in? Yeah. You know the circuit? Well, I've seen diagrams of it. Good. Take that one. Bring her back in one piece and in decent time, and we'll see what we can do. Right. - ANNOUNCER: Joe Machin, - Lotus, Number 16, - has done a practice lap - in three minutes, 58 seconds. - 3:58. [ENGINE REVVING] - And now the second - Team Lotus car, - Number 17, is going out. - I can't tell who's driving it. - I don't recognize - the driver at all. - The two Lotuses - seem to be having - a private race. - This chap in Number 17 - is certainly giving - Machin a close run. [TIRES SCREECHING] - Joe Machin has done - a lap now in 3:57, - three minutes 57, - equaling George Harper's - BRM time. - But the driver in - the yellow helmet in Number 17 - who's been chasing Machin hard - all around the circuit - has managed 3:57.4. - A wonderful drive - by this unknown driver. - And here come the two - Team Lotuses into the pits - after this tremendous - practice drive. - Joe Machin, Number 16, - leading in his mysterious - teammate in car Number 17. - We'll soon be able to - find out who it was. JOE: Hey, Harry, what are you doing? Racing without judges? Well? You have a place as an alternate. Thanks. What the hell's going on? Hey, the scribbler. Hello, Joe. What's up? Well, I used to be a driver myself some time ago. Well, what do you know? Listen, I rented a little place near here. Why don't you drop up for dinner tonight? Good wine, food, gab. Yeah, sure, I'd love to, only I have a date with my secretary tonight. Secretary? Bring her along. She's probably just my brother's type. The address is 13 Balmoral. I'll see you tonight. Okay, see you. JOE: Steve, here's to our book. To our book. How do you like the wine? For me, it's fine. To me, it tastes like sour grape juice. I like a good shot of whiskey. Or champagne. I really like that stuff. Tell me, did you ever see any of my races? STEVE: I'm not sure. I was in Monza in '58. You know when de Portago got killed? I wasn't in that one. Where else? Tour de Sicily '59, here '60. And Sebring '58. That's where I drove. I won them all. This is going to be my big year. Joe Machin, Grand Prix champion. Why'd you give it up? I don't like the races. Why not? I think they've been pushed past the point of safety. Yet you want me to be a model for this book you're going to write. Why do you want to write a book about a guy who makes his bread in such a lousy game? I didn't say I disapproved of the drivers. Only the races. Why? Because intellectually I believe... Oh, no, no, no. Nothing so muddy as that. You tell me why. From deep down in yourself, tell me why. Joseph, Mr. Children is our guest. I told him he could be as close as a boil on my neck, hear me talk in my sleep, you know what I mean. Yeah. Okay. The roads are too slow, the cars are too fast, the crowds are too thick. Oh, so you're worried about the not-so-innocent bystander. Aren't you? Why do you think they line the roads? To discuss road adhesion and torque? Uh-uh. They want to see a guy spill his guts all over the concrete. Okay, then, why do you race? Why do men climb mountains, Mr. Children? What do cars have to do with mountains? I drive for money. I guess I said something stupid. No, no. I think this talk about motor cars and danger is better left with the men. Miss Anderson. Miss Weston. Will you walk in the garden with me? If you'll excuse me, I'll join you in a moment. Now, don't kill that bottle until I come back. No. Why don't we go in the bar and have a shot of brandy? Fine. You know, I like this new breed of broad they're making over here. They're always at you, fighting like 400 horsepower. Do you always compare women to cars? Well, they're a lot alike, you know. Both dangerous to you. What do you mean by that? To your life. Oh, don't talk crazy. You know, you really control women, just like you do cars. That's right. Control them, use them. They'd both tear your heart out if they could. Then they're a threat to you? Everything's a threat. But you pick women and cars to be afraid of. Why? I'm not afraid of them. You're not? Of course. I don't avoid them, do I? STEVE: Well, then, what is it you feel? Contempt? Yes, I feel contempt for them. Then you feel superior to women? Yes, I do feel superior to women. Superior to Lea Anderson? Of course. Superior to your wife? [GLASS SMASHING] Your methods are too familiar to my brother. He, too, presses in dangerous places. You know, this is the first time you ever invited me to walk with you and talk to you. You forget, I showed you my garden when we first met in Madrid. Are you saying it's polite to talk to me once more before I disappear from the scene? Oh, give him up. He only makes you unhappy. There are vows between us. That's noble, but not very practical. We girls have been running around without chaperones for quite a while. That may be your way, but it is not mine. He steps all over you. You want to take my place? You want his feet on you? No. I stand as tall as he does. I'm his equal, even if I am a woman. He can be handled. You're just a new kind of flower to be admired, enjoyed, but not particularly cherished. And does Joe cherish you? It's for me to cherish him. And that leaves you housekeeper, nose wiper and maid of all work. Does it leave you convenient, too? It leaves me with respect. Remember, Lea, if you hold an exotic house flower in the heat of your hand too long, it wilts and loses interest. Are you going to ask Joe to have me leave? We have no secret, you and I. We know Joe would never respect such a request. I'd hoped you'd leave of your own choice, for your good. You mean, for your pride. This writer has sharp eyes. I need a drink. And afterwards, I'll ask Joe to give me some lessons in night driving. You pushed me into insulting you. That means I'll have to fight you now. [CHUCKLES] Would you like a glass of champagne? I'd love a glass of champagne. Let's find a hill to walk on or a tree to sit under. I know just the place. [CHUCKLING] Come on. [SHUSHING] Don't want to wake anybody up. [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh, look. You know, you're a beautiful girl. More beautiful than your wife? Much more. She's not the woman for you, Joe. Oh, I know that. Look, I want a drink. No, don't drink now. But I want one. Here. Oh, Joe, why does it have to be this way? What's the matter with this way? Why can't we show the world that we love each other? Look, I'm married. She'd never give me a divorce. Well, then just leave her, so we can be together and free. We will be together. Just give it some time. How can we know how much time there is? Oh, we've got plenty of time, plenty of time. But every time I see a race, my breath is stopped all the while. When I hear a crash and see the flames break out from a broken car, I think, "Is it finally Joe?" It hurts to love a man that can be dead next week. It hurts real good, though, doesn't it, honey? You hold a guy and you think, "I'd better love him as hard as I can, "because maybe tomorrow he won't be here." Please, Joe, not like this. Oh, honey, take it easy. Come on, let's go. No. I want more than this. Oh, why don't you come off it? What do you want? A payoff? All I want is you. And that's what you got. I didn't mean that. Ah, don't kid me. I met your type before. Every resort, every race, every dirt track. Oh, you're rotten to me, Joe. You love every minute of it. LEA: "In memory of Marie Le Jeune, "beloved wife, "who died in the 20th year of her beauty." Joe... I'm only 20 years old. It's hot, ain't it? I saw the glow of your cigarette. You look ill. Wine, brandy and heat sometimes fight each other, give you dreams, bad dreams. Often? Yeah, quite often. Only trouble is, it's always the same dream. I see myself in a white car driving down a long, straight road. Not racing, mind you, just going like hell on my own. Then up ahead I see where eight roads come together. Seven black cars heading for the same intersection. I put my foot on the brake, goes right to the floor. And I keep going faster, faster, faster and faster. We crash all at once. [LAUGHS] And my white car turns red. You anticipate your own death, or perhaps you feel guilty over someone else's. Oh, no, no, no. I only felt guilty once in my life, when I was a kid, racing on a brick oval. Car crowded me, I got scared, I jerked the wheel, he flipped over. [LAUGHING] You know why I felt guilty? I felt guilty because I was happy it was him smeared all over the track and not me. Maybe you're afraid that people could watch you die with the same feeling of elation. I told you that's why they come, to see somebody get it. Preferably me. Why you, in particular? You really think that people are that cruel? Walk down any street in any town, you'll find a dozen guys that'll chop you into little pieces and laugh while they were doing it, if they thought they could get away with it. So you're the substitute for them to vent their feelings on? That's right. Why are you? Why do you race? I told you, I don't like the slums. Mmm-mmm. That's not the only reason. I know what bugs you. You're disturbed because people act as if the words you've written were whispered in your ear. They don't figure you had to have sensitive feelings to put them down. How can you know that? Because they cheer for Joe Machin, the Grand Prix driver, not Joe the man. Why did you really come to Spa? To write a book. Yes, about racers. Do you expect pearls of wisdom from Joe? I can think of a half a dozen educated, articulate men who can serve your purpose better. Or is it that you want to write a book about an ignorant bum? Now, would you care? I seem to notice a certain strain between you two. You put it too nicely. I hate my brother. But why do you hate him? Oh, I've seen the look often enough in my own mirror to know it on you. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Well, then, why does it seem to be such a guilty conversation? Because I owe my brother gratitude. And because there's a part of Joe I'd like to kill, but not the part that's my brother. LYNWARD: Steve. Hello, Bob. I want you to change. Pettison's ill. You're driving. Well, if you think I can... Your practice times have been good enough. All I want you to do is get in there and finish. Okay. Good luck, kid.

Very good. Better than I expected. Thanks. Pettison's in hospital, appendix. Oh, I'm sorry. Nothing very serious. After today's performance, I've decided to start you in the lineup. - ANNOUNCER: And here are - the official results - of the Belgian Grand Prix. - First, Joe Machin, - Number 16, Team Lotus. I'm not quite sure why you asked to be taken on as an alternative, why, in fact, you're following the Grand Prix circuit. I told you. I'm writing a book. Yes, of course you did. You were always a promising driver, but today you were a good one. But don't try to drive to win against a man like Machin. He's not only the best, but he's dangerous. No more time. Bye-bye. Hey, there's Joe. Come on. So long. Not bad, Joe. Not bad. Ah, here's a pleasant way to start the day. Hi, Steve. Hello, Miss Weston. Is that one of those international babies who say good night early in the morning? Oh, now, now, she's a working girl. Here, have a cherry. I'd half expected to see Lea. No, she likes the mineral springs at Spa, and I like the change. Why don't you try cold showers? Hey, you're a cute kid. She's a real cute kid. You wouldn't kid a fellow, would you? No, honest, you're a doll. I know now why you're in this writing racket. You wouldn't like to split a cup of coffee with us, would you? No, I'm going to try the course. You coming? No. I think I'll be along later. Okay? You're a doll. She's a real doll. He has a certain rough charm. I've never seen him in operation on a fresh female before. Oh, don't worry, Steve, I'm comparatively unflattered. Oh, look, I didn't mean that it was coming from your side. Oh, but I like to see you flex your muscles around me, Steve, even if it's only your jaw muscles. Henny, what's the matter? You seem to be keeping the door to an argument open between us. Maybe it's the change of water or the weather or the flight over, I don't know. Has it been hard, working for me? It's been long. Well, he seems to have a talent for rapid conquest. [OFFERING IN FRENCH] [ACCEPTS IN FRENCH] You know, Steve, I've been a model modern girl, with twice the efficiency and half the complications, equally at home in blue jeans or satin, night dress or natural pink. I figured I knew most of the jokes and 90% of the punch lines. But I think maybe I've got some more to learn around here. There's a good view of the course from here. Hiya, Steve. Miss Weston. Hello, Joe. There's a bad turn at the church. You'd better ease up. Yeah, okay. I'll see you later, huh? How would you like to see the sights? Why not? When I was a little girl, I always dreamed of living in a house by a river. Well, I'll rent one. We'll have a big party the night of the race. [LAUGHS] You do things big and in a hurry, don't you? Get it while you can. Get what? Money, women, fame? Ah, that's too deep. Let's talk about you and me. I believe in being direct. So do I. Let's face it, Joe. You can't resist trying out your routine on every woman you meet. Well, you can't think much of yourself. Oh, I think I'm an attractive enough girl. [CHUCKLES] But I think of myself as a person, too. Yeah, but maybe this aloof bit is your routine. Look, Joe, I'm not offering any challenges, and I don't want to be a trophy. Let's be friends. You call me Henny and I'll call you Joe. You keep your line to yourself, and I'll keep any admiring glances behind my sunglasses. Oh, I don't know. I've never been just friends with a woman. Try it, okay? Okay. The concierge gave me your note. You're still working for me. Where've you been all day? Did you want to give some dictation? I asked you a question. Well, your tone wasn't very flattering. Should I take lessons in flattery from Machin? Should I be your trained dog, to be loyal and growl at your enemy? Henny, I expected you to see him for what he is. Well, you don't even know yourself. You started out to destroy him, humiliate him, to crush his ego. Why aren't you at work doing that? Because I want to be fair. You want to compete. Don't make this a battle of ego, Steve. He'll come out whole, you'll come out in fragments. So you've already marked him the better man. No, the weaker. But he's very shrewd in that weakness. He has the fast cars, and along with them, the women. Do you think that's important to me? Well, a woman started you on all this. And now you third-degree me because of my possible interest in another man. You never noticed when I was safely cloistered in carbon paper, except for the first couple of months, remember? We agreed that something else excluded it. Sure, a compartment for each. Were you that hurt? Are you taking this chance to get back at me? I'm just a little tired and a little afraid of the whole affair. Get out of it, Steve. In due time. You ready? Let's go. One of the juniors is nearly over. You follow me, and I guarantee you we'll take the first two places. Hey, that secretary of yours is quite a gal. Too bad nothing can happen between us. Oh, you're not giving up so soon, are you? Oh, look, I know the races I can win. I like my women to come to me. I like to take the easy route. Why are you telling me? For my biography. Sometimes I try to hide things: my ignorance, my fear before the next race. Sometimes I feel I have to talk to somebody about it. What about your wife? No, I can't talk to her. She's the daughter of a couple of poor, wandering ex-aristocrats. I bought her. Haven't you got a friend? Henny called me her friend. But I feel only a man can be a man's friend. [CHUCKLES] You know, maybe you're right. Yesterday I would've insisted that you were wrong. That's because you're a fool in some ways. You know, we're both missing part of what it takes. I want to be understood. You don't want anybody to know you too well. I'll follow you around. Bet we can sweep the first two places. Let's go. - ANNOUNCER: And here are - the grid positions - and practice times for - the French Grand Prix. - In pole position, Number 12, - Joe Machin, Team Lotus, - two minutes 14.8. - Next to him in the middle - of the front row, - Number 22, - Bruce McLaren, Cooper, - two minutes 15 seconds. - And on the outside - of the front row, - Steve Children, Number 14, - in the second team Lotus, - two minutes 15.4 seconds.

This is what's known as a night out with the boys. [WOMEN LAUGHING] But only babies sit on girls' laps. It's the other way around when you grow up. Hey, and you're a baby! Oh, now, wait a minute. What do you mean by that? A baby with dangerous toys. Baby's feelings, grab, grab, take things! I'm going to smack you on the nose. Oh, you'll need all your pit crew for that. Oh, I'm going to crush you like a bug. A very unimaginative picture. I'm going to stuff you in a carburetor. Hey! Hey! No! Hey! Come on! Come on! [BOTH LAUGHING] [SAYING GOODBYE IN FRENCH] [WOMEN SAYING GOODBYE IN FRENCH] You know, Joe. Yeah? I could tell you a few things. Tell me a few things. Like, for example, your brother. He's loyal to you. Oh, I know. He'd die for me, wouldn't he? Maybe he would. Maybe he would. Why don't you stop riding him? He doesn't leave, does he? You know why? Because he loves my wife, and she doesn't give a hoot about... Have you spoken to Sesia about that? No. Well, why don't you? MAN: Mr. Machin. We don't want to interrupt your conversation, but my wife would like to meet you. John never thinks to introduce us. I'm Mrs. Philmore and this is my husband. Hello. How do you do? My name is Stephen Children. This is your host, Mr. Machin. How do you do? I thought you drove a thrilling race, Mr. Machin. And we've so enjoyed your party. Thank you. Well, these men obviously left the party to talk. Come on, May. Her address and the time she can leave her husband. Right. That's the type I get, the hungry ones. They don't want a man, they want a symbol. So why do you bother? Look, sometimes they get rougher than that. In Monte Carlo I nearly had to bat one in the mouth. She was making a public stink. She wanted you that bad, eh? Nah, nah, nah, she was an alley cat. Oh, look, let's forget this. Let's go into town and tear it up. Come on! [LAUGHING] I'm drunk. I may be sick. [GLASS CLATTERING] No, you shouldn't be fussing over me like this. But, darling, I'm your wife. [CHUCKLES] Are you? Are you really my wife? Do you doubt it? I serve you, as a wife should. I honor you, as a wife should. You kept the bargain, all right. What bargain, Joe? Oh, you stuck with me, even though you hated me for buying you. Joe, have you thought that? Do you think I married you because you helped my father? I would never do that. I love you, Joe. [SOBBING] You've never cried before me. And you have never seen me cry. Why do you? For the loneliness of the nights in strange rooms, when you were with strange women. What a terrible thing, when people don't speak with each other. [SOBBING] And I think it's important that people see each other weep. Hi. Hi. Hey, you gonna race if it rains today? Oh, sure, we'll be racing. I'd better check the brakes on that car, though, Steve. Yeah. I'll see you in the pits. See you later, Henny. Bye. You guys do the town again last night? No. We just spent half the night talking. Well, whatever it is, it seems to be doing him some good. What are you getting out of the osmosis? Self-doubts, maybe. You know, Henny, you were right about Monique. She was able to fool me. I wish you wouldn't admit it to me, Steve. I pretended that she was what I wanted her to be, or at least that she could be. Pygmalion complex? Isn't that what you were trying to tell me? What I tried to tell you is a lot simpler than that. And what I'm trying to tell you now is I don't want to be your inner ear anymore. Why not? [ENGINE STARTING] I might try a new role. See you at lunch. [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] [CRASHING] [BOY CRYING] Are you all right, little man? [STARTING GUN FIRES] [TIRES SQUEALING] - ANNOUNCER: Now taking over, - ahead on the straight. - Close bunches of cars - fighting for places - all through the field. - Running a bit too close, - some of them, - on this very fast circuit. - Somebody's got hit, - right in front of the others. [AUDIENCE SCREAMS] - They've just missed him. - First, Number 10, - Machin, Lotus, - just holding off Number 6, - McLaren, Cooper. - McLaren in front of Machin, - coming up... [TIRES SQUEALING] - Oh, dear, they dusted - each other there. - Two duel for the lead, - McLaren and Machin. - McLaren drawing ahead - as they lap slower cars. - Steve Children in there - mixing it hard - with the others. - Behind them, Number 8, Maggs, - 12, Children, and 2, Harper, - fighting it out for - third place, nothing less. - Some of the back markers - a bit wild. - They're not used - to this fast circuit. - There's somebody off. [CRASHING] [TIRES SCREECHING] - One lap, here they come. - McLaren's having a go. - Machin has deferred to him, - while McLaren's through. - Machin's back - in second place. - Bruce McLaren wins - the Reims Grand Prix. - What an incredible finish! - And what's wrong - with Joe Machin today? - Steve Children came in third, - Harper fourth. - ANNOUNCER: Number 20, - Joe Machin, 1:53.6. - Number 8, - Werner's Porsche, 1:54.8. - One minute 54.8 seconds. Any tips on how to drive it? Yeah. Don't. What's wrong? Nothing. Come on. I don't want to talk about it. Hey, now, come on, what's the matter? Steve, you were right to quit. Steve, I'm scared. Remember Reims? I was really scared there. Well, you always have been. That dream... Yeah. According to you, I dreamed what I wouldn't admit. Well, that might be so. But I never felt the car like it was a living thing under my hands, trying to kill me. What happened? Maybe talking to you. I guess I found something of value, that's all. - ANNOUNCER: Number 18, - Tony Banks' Cooper, - coming in. - His best lap 1:55, - one minute 55. Hello, Joseph Machin. Well, well, Daphne. It's good to see you. Well, you used to do better than that. Oh, Stephen Children, Miss Daphne Harold. How do you do? How do you do? I've arranged in town to have your things taken to the arbor. Oh? Well, you shouldn't have done that. I'm married. You were the last time we met. Your charming wife's things are there. I want you both to stay for the meet. Oh, and you, too, Mr. Children. Well, thank you, but I think we've already... Your secretary's already been invited. I think I can promise you both some very pleasant evenings. Till then? I'll see you later, Daphne. Rather forceful girl, isn't she? That's the kind I get. DAPHNE: Oh, Mr. Children. It's nearly time for tea, but I know you Americans prefer a cocktail. Dry martini all right? Fine. Thank you. You don't much like me, do you? Why do you say that? Oh, I sense things. I have no reason for not liking you. Well, not me personally, but me in relationship to Joe Machin. Oh? How's your drink? Fine, fine, thank you. You watch over him as though you personally created him. We've become friends. I hear he comes to you with all his fears. You'd rather he came to you? Oh, he has. I don't think he will anymore. You're not very gallant. Gallantry can be delivered with a bow or a slap. I see. And a few slaps from you will cure me of Joe Machin? More likely a few bows from Joe. He's changed quite a bit from the Joe that you knew. Writers. See all, know all and tell all. I didn't mean to be so blunt. Why not? I am. I enjoy Joseph. And I intend to continue to do so, from time to time. Be interesting to see who will prove right. Now, let's eat. I found him lost among the flowers, Sir William. I'm so glad you could come. Thank you. May I introduce Henrietta Weston? How do you do? Stephen Children. A great pleasure. I've heard, with interest, you've come out of nowhere and are doing very well. Well, I've had a great teacher. A dangerous one. I drive hard, but I drive fair. You drive like a 16-year-old pursuing a maiden, trampling down the flowers as you pass. Is it the custom here for one guest to insult another? Oh, you're too sensitive. This has been going on for three seasons. Why? I'm a critic. Oh? For whom do you write? Oh, no, no. A critic of life. My interests are universal. I am the modern renaissance man, observing the barbarian. STEVE: With a bit of envy perhaps? Don't front for me, Steve. Do you, as hostess... I relinquish my duties to you. Very well. May I see you to your car? Thank you. Till the race, Joseph. HENNY: Why, in Heaven's name, was he riding you? Oh, a lot of people are filled with vague hates. What are your motives in seeking an argument with Joe Machin? I was merely expressing my opinion. What does he test in his flirtation with death? His manhood? Or does he seek power? Power over women, for example. I think we agree that such motives hardly create a picture of a valuable human being. I think you're a posturing dilettante. Now, now. Don't be too hard on me. I may be the instrument of your vengeance. My vengeance? Monaco. Remember when we were kids, sitting on the roof of the tenement, watching the lights of the city? Uh-huh. Playing Kick the Can or Ring-a-Leerio? Or summer nights when I used to have to come get you to come home for supper? [CHUCKLES] Yeah. I was probably in some junkyard picking up some parts for some heap I was working on. A lot of water under the bridge, Joe. Uh-huh. A lot of water under the bridge. We haven't talked like this in quite a while. We used to be partners. I guess I ruined that. No, just bent it a little. Bob, you love Sesia, don't you? Yes. That's why you've been hanging around. That's not the only reason. You know something? I love her, too. I learned a lot in Rouen. I know. I'll be leaving soon. No, no. I want you to stay. Please. There's still a lot of things I'm scared of. See you tomorrow. Big race. Thoughts? I was wondering if I'd disarmed Joe. He can take care of himself. You know, Henny, during the war there was a soldier in my squad in Korea. He had a filthy mouth, bandit manners, no friends, but he was a killing machine. And on the line, everyone stuck as close to him as they could, but in town they avoided him. Well, one night I felt sorry for him, and we had a couple of beers together. He got drunk. He cried and told me all about himself. I told him no man was alone, that every man could find friends, respect. I kind of liked him. Well, the first day back on the line, he got killed being too careful. Racing isn't war, Steve. No, but it's combat, and I'm afraid that only the cool and the passionate survive. Don't forget, you're racing tomorrow, too. - ANNOUNCER: Coming out - of the pits now for practice - is Number 12, - George Harper's BRM. - Just as Number 2, - Purcelli's Ferrari, goes by. - Here's a fast lap - for Number 16, - Bruce McLaren's Cooper. - One minute 54.6 seconds, - 1:54.6. Joseph... I don't want to talk to you. You're a jinx. You wrong me. I have some information for you, interesting information. I don't want it. This friend of yours, this Stephen Children... What about him? He's no friend. His original purpose was to write a book about you, to expose you as an ignorant, arrogant, stupid, indiscriminate seducer. Why would he want to do that? Because the girl, Monique, that you used and insulted in Monaco was to have been his wife. I don't believe you. Joseph... That was taken in London no more than eight weeks ago. Let him write his book. Perhaps he's changed his mind. Perhaps he's decided to drive instead, and when the opportunity came, to kill you in a racing accident. This was the oldest of the cars. This was... This was the... Do you know a girl by the name of Monique? Well, do you know her? The girl in Monte Carlo. I was engaged to her. Who told you this? It doesn't matter. You just watch yourself on the track. Oh, now, look, Joe, don't be stupid. Sure, I was angry at first, I did it to get back at you. Sure, sure. I know I'm stupid, but I can drive. So can you, smart boy. The difference is, I drive to live. You drive for kicks. And I was born in a slum. You were raised with a silver spoon in your mouth, and you went ripping around trying to prove what a playboy was made of. Did you ever hear of Hell's Kitchen, New York? That's good. We both know what street fighting is, don't we? How did he find out? I think I know. Spreading good will and sunshine again? Ah, Mr. Children. I heard about your dramatic farewell with Machin. Yes, you should. You set it up. You must stay broke keeping your spies busy. We're comrades in a common cause. I had a similar experience. I wasn't born to wealth, you know. But I won't outline my history, except to say it was 43 years before I thought of anything else. Then I married. She was much younger than I was. I had no delusions about my desirability. You knew you were buying her with money and position. A woman is a merchant with a commodity to sell. Most of them accept various kinds of currency. I wasn't born handsome. Mmm-hmm. But Machin was. No. Some women like crudity and brutality. They hunger after animal strength and physical prowess. I wasn't born a gladiator either. But you can't stand to lose. Machin was a novice when he took my wife from me. He enjoyed her for perhaps a month. I'm sorry. Don't be. She wasn't worth it. But then, neither was your Monique. You didn't value your wife and yet you... When I was 22, a man 5 inches taller and 50 pounds heavier punished me badly. I waited three years for the opportunity. His legs were crushed in an earth slide. The thought repels you? No. The method. But you were prepared to indulge in character assassination. My intentions weren't clear. I developed no plan. And before I... Before you could, you grew to like the man. I have not. Your plan still escapes me. I've heard it said in prize-fighting circles that it's a good idea to instill fear into one's opponent and then to taunt him to anger. How many times, when you've been angry, have you almost been in an accident on a city street? Insurance actuaries will tell you that angry men are accident-prone. You're very subtle. Oh, I never indulge in violence. I merely create the atmosphere. How devious we've been. We neither of us had the simple directness to punch him in the nose. Hey, Joe, I want to talk to you. Well, you can forget it, smart boy. We've got a race to drive, remember? See you at the track. - ANNOUNCER: Fastest - practice lap yesterday - was put up by Joe Machin - in Team Lotus, - Number 16, 1:53.6. - And now the cars - are lining up on the grid - in the order that I gave you. - Ready for the start of - the British Grand Prix, 1963. - I can see - the two Team Lotuses, - Number 20, - ridden by Joe Machin, - and 22, Steve Children. [STARTING GUN FIRES] - [ANNOUNCER CHATTERING - INDISTINCTLY] [TIRES SQUEALING] - Joe Machin and Steve Children - in the Team Lotuses, - Numbers 20 and 22, lead, - with Bruce McLaren, - Number 16, in third place, - Purcelli's Ferrari fourth. - Steve Children - challenging Joe Machin, - and he's passed him. - Number 22, Steve Children, - in the lead. - Number 20, - Joe Machin, second. - Where's the teamwork - they showed in France? [TIRES SCREECHING] - Now McLaren's coming up - on the two Lotuses. - Children and Machin are - too busy fighting each other. - They let him through! - McLaren leads! - A fantastic battle between - the two Lotus drivers, - Machin and Children, - fighting between themselves, - within their Lotus team. This isn't good. They're fighting each other, not the road. Well, they threw the race in their own interests. The last time they'll drive for me. - Children and Machin - going into the corner. - Steve Children - is going too wide. - Wait for it, he's lost it, - and the car's over. - Children's been thrown off, - right in front of Machin, - Machin swerves, he's gone off. [CROWD GASPS] [SIREN BLARING] Joe? Well, I almost bought it that time. Price of Steve's life. He's all right. How do you feel? Finished. Timing is off. Reflexes slow after this. You'd be driving scared. I've been doing that for years. It's like running down a hill. You keep going faster and faster, knocking down anything that gets in your way. 'Cause you're afraid if you try to stop, you'll fall. Oh, at first it feels great. Then not so good, until you almost want to fall, just to get it over with. But you keep on running. I realize now I never had to. I didn't need it. It'll seem funny, not having a Machin on the track. No. I'm just going to sit on the grass, look around, see things and people. Well, I'll bring you a mirror next time I come. Maybe you'd like to see the kind of a guy you are now. What kind of a guy am I? Pretty busted up on the outside, but all put together on the inside. Hello. Hello. It was so nice to receive your letters, but so much nicer to see you. Thank you. Hello, Sesia. Hello. Gee, it's good to see you again. And it's nice to see you. And, darling, I got us rooms at the Metropole. We're all settled. Everything's taken care of. Long life and many children for your marriage, Stephen. And Joe? How's Joe? JOE: Will somebody buy me a drink? Hi, Steve. Hello, Joe. Hello, friend. Hi, honey. How's the leg? Well, it drags a little on the curves. You know, I'm team captain now. No! Yeah. - Garcon,[/I] champagne. Well, it's been a long time, Steve. Too long. Oh, by the way, there's something I want to say to you. I don't like some of the things you say about me in this book. But it really is good. Put your name in it, will you? Sure.
