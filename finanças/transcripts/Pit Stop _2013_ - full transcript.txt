His doctor said there's still brain activity, so he could still wake up. It's just a matter of time. I'm so sorry I didn't call you back sooner. It's OK...

You already have a bunch of stuffed animals. I want another one like this one. Maybe he can mail it to you. See, he's got a job. And that job is in another town very far away.

Last time I ate there was with you. Our last anniversary. - You remember. - Why wouldn't I? I didn't. I didn't even think about it until the waitress came out with the dessert menu. They still have that special cake. You know, the one you tried to order, but you couldn't pronounce it. We laughed so hard. We thought it was so funny. We both drank a lot that night. Winston ordered it for us. I didn't even ask. He just picked it out, ordered it, said it perfectly. And I just felt like... I miss us. You and me, and Cindy, and the way we were. We're still all together. We're still a family, right? I guess... I don't know. Shannon... Why do you have to-- No, don't... You want me to come back? I'll move back in here with y'all. I don't mind. I'm not with Chuck anymore. No, it's better this way. Then what? What else can I do? You want me to stay away? No. Cindy needs you. I need you. It's just... Sometimes, I miss you.
