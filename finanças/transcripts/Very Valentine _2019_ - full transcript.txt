I grew up loving weddings. The brides, beautiful in their gowns. The grooms, handsome in their tuxedos. But most of all, I've always loved wedding shoes. My family was in the business of making them. And from the time I was small, I loved to help. I'm not the pretty sister. I'm not the smart sister, either. I'm the funny one. Oh, why? What's she doing? But I was always serious about one thing. I wanted to grow up and create shoes that's make a bride feel like a princess. Yo, funny one! Come on! Let's go. Oh Valentine, you're always such a mess. Okay, here we go. Ready? Today is my baby sister Jaclyn's turn to walk the walk in our shoes. The Angelini Shoe Company has been making custom wedding shoes since 1903. We build our shoes like the bride and groom build a life. With vision, persistence and love. Ah! Valentine, you're always such a mess! Sorry, Ma. Everybody, time for a picture. Family portrait. All right. Here's the good news. As the last unmarried woman in my family, I've run out of sisters, so I never have to be a bridesmaid again. Twenty-two weddings later and nothing's changed, I am still single and I'm still dressed like a pink daiquiri. In fact, I could use one. Oh, my God. You look so beautiful. Doesn't she look beautiful, Tess? She's a beauty. Don't embellish. Danny Napoli wants to dance with you. Ooh! He's single. He wears a hairpiece. Oh, come on. Who doesn't? Will you just put yourself out there? You're a total original and you have so much to offer. Too much, if you ask this dress. Mmm. Nah. You look ripe. And juicy. Ma, if you really want me to meet a nice guy, why did you put me at a table with your friends? Well, Meghan and Harry split up the family at their wedding. Because we have so much in common with the royal family. Hmm. I'd like to have their staff. Mmm. But Meghan found her prince and so can you. I'm happy. Are you? You can reinvent your life any old time. You don't need to live with your grandmother and make shoes. Hmm? Let's dance. Isn't Gram amazing? Yeah. I really need to work out. I need to cut her liquor off. No, you need to come with me. Let's go! Oh, handsome! You want to dance, sis? Well, God invented brothers so that their single sisters would have somebody to dance with at weddings. Come on. Mmm-hmm. So, I wish you'd settle down. Find a decent guy. I haven't even stepped on your feet yet and you're already stepping on my heart. You need to make some changes. Gram needs to retire. She has a business to run. Well, yeah. It's failing. Every company has ups and downs. It's been down an awful long time, Val. It's just time to face up to reality. Check this, Alfred, we love our work. The business keeps Gram young. In fact, she runs circles around me. So sorry! Can I steal my husband back for a second? Did Alfred upset you? What else is a family wedding for? Oh, come on. Hey, ho! It's time to go. Oh, at last! Aw, Gram! Let's go before Uncle Pinooch gets drunk and starts singing. True. Love you, Gram. Congratulations. Thank you. Bye, sis. Mmm. Beautiful. Mwah! Happy, happy, yeah? Yeah. Granny. Hey! You're leaving? I gotta get Gram home before the great-aunts start mud wrestling for the centerpieces. Oh! Good night, Ma. Mmm. Love you. Bye. Bye, sweetie. Love you. Early evening, ladies? Yeah. Rough night for you, no? Piece of cake. Nothing's more fun than being single at a wedding. But, I'm happy for Jaclyn. She looked amazing. Mmm. Why is Alfred on a mission to have you retire? Because I went to see him for advice. Why would you do that? Every time I try to talk with you about the finances of the business, you change the subject. I worry that I am holding you back. When you are young, you should be young. Have your own life, your own place. A hundred years ago, my great-grandfather, a poor cobbler, came from Italy and began making wedding shoes. He had a simple idea, to make something beautiful to honor the most important moment in a woman's life, when she commits her heart to another. Every grommet, seam and binding were made by hand. And here we are, in Greenwich Village in the same shop. Still holding onto his dream. Ugh. It's boiling. Global warming. Oh, did you water the tomatoes before we left? No. You better get up there and douse them. Ugh. It's so hot they've probably changed into sauce. It's long distance. It's my tanner from Italy. Ask him if he has any pebbled leather. Or cash. I'm never wearing Spanx again. I'm done with weddings. Oh! That feels so good. Ah. Oh, my God. Oh, God! Oh, God. Your grandfather used to come down here in the middle of the night to work. I can think when it's quiet. He said the muse called him and pulled him to the leather. Thought I was the only one. You're just like him. He was driven, too. Every seam had to be just right. I learned the difference between working with satin or with grosgrain, but I could never make the final decision. He did. And you can. I remember you sitting with Grandpa, drawing. You were born to it. Hmm. Don't stay up too late. It'll kill your looks. Make excuse. Tell me your recipe! Oh! Don't you look cozy? Don't let me interrupt. Valentine, I'd like you to meet Roman Falconi. He's a friend of the family of Ida DeCarlo. Hmm. On Hudson Street. Such a small world, hmm? It is. It's, uh, nice to see you again, Valentine. We've met? Don't you take care of the garden on the roof? Oh. Valentine, she tends the garden, the tomatoes every day. Not every day. Not even at night? Nah, never at night. Unless it's hot, hmm? Oh, last night was a scorcher. Oh! So hot it broke a record. Hmm. All right, yeah. It was hot. Ah, if you'll excuse me, Roland... Actually, it's, uh, Roman. Whatever. I have things to do. Valentine, take him on the tour. Of the garden. After you. Thanks. It's this way? Really? Okay, here it is! Uh, the roof. The sky. The river. Let's go. Wait... wait a minute. What's the rush, you know? You're not going to give me the whole tour? Maybe a little conversation? I don't know you. We can fix that. I don't need fixing. All right, I'll give you that. You are, uh... You are perfect. Ugh. Okay. So why don't you like me? Okay, maybe you're a Lothario who goes around seducing old ladies by speaking crappy Italian, but that's not gonna work with me. No. I'm a chef. How about I make you dinner? I'm not hungry. No? Mmm-mmm. What? Oh! Well, not now, maybe. But one day you're gonna get hungry. And when you do, I'm your man. Well, thanks for giving me the tour. I hope it didn't hurt too much. Just a bit. Well, if you do change your mind then, uh... Please. And you really shouldn't be ashamed of your body. You're lovely. Ciao. You're going to kill that leather. We could use a new crank. Ah. Well, you can't afford it. It's fine. I'll just get some oil. Gram, you've done a good job treading water but you're barely breaking even. We'll just turn out more product. We already working in the weekend. We're not a factory. Well, maybe you should be. Maybe you take the shoes and you mass produce 'em. Oh, maybe we should stop making our own sauce and eat spaghetti out of a can. You should consider closing down altogether. You have no business sense. Your website is a place-card holder. Your social media presence is nil. No publicity. The sign above the door is so faded you can't even read it. Because we're busy making shoes by hand. Alfredo, what would you suggest? Gram, you're, what, like... No numbers. I know exactly how old I am. You look amazing. That's the point. Okay, it's time to relax. Retire already. This building is worth a fortune. You sell it and you'll never have to worry about money again. Just let me bring a broker through, hmm? I suppose it can't hurt. This is your idea of getting help for the business? We have to listen to Alfredo. We don't need him to save us. I wouldn't be so sure of that, Val. I am sure of one thing, you have no respect for what we create. What's in it for you? What the hell are you implying? That's enough, you two. I don't want you fighting over this. It will be the end of everything. At least I know what's worth fighting for and I remember a time when you did, too. This business has been in the toilet plenty. You'll get through this. You always do. Did you tell them about, uh, Roman Falconi? Gram. The Roman Falconi? What's a "Roman Falconi"? He's a chef. And he owns the Ca' d'Oro in Little Italy. Oh! Ah! Wow. My sister will have a serving of that. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Oh, well, you can imagine? She won't call him. What? And he wants her to call him. I don't have time for men right now. Sure. That's why you kept his card. Hmm. Give me the number. We can't be wasting natural resources like this. I believe in fun. Call him up. Chef Falconi, please. What? No! Tess! Gimme... Gimme the phone. He's all yours. Roman? It's Valentine. Who? Valentine... Valentine... Oh! You mean Teodora's granddaughter? Yes. Hi. Um, you said if I were ever hungry, I should give you a call. Mmm-hmm. Why don't you come over? You know, after we close tonight. I'll make you some risotto. I'll be there soon. Yes! I hate you all! You made it. I got hungry. Oh. I'm glad you did. Mmm. Ooh, you smell nice. Thanks. So do you. Thank you. It's not me, it's the risotto. The bag. If you would follow me, ma'am. Okay. Oh, whoa! I have to work for my supper? Mmm-hmm. House rules. Whoa. All right, nice and snug. Mmm-hmm. All right, you're all set. Come on in. So, I have to know. Why did you decide to call me? My sisters made me. Oh! So, you were pushed into it? Nudged. So there's still a chance that you like me a little bit? I'll let you know after I taste your risotto. Ooh! Okay. That's a challenge. In that case, I will let you know after you grate me some Parmesan. Let me take that off you. I, uh, think we should probably lose this. Oh. No point wasting that beautiful dress, huh? Uh-huh. Now, please, take a seat. Thank you. Such a gentleman. A pleasure. I really want you to try one of my absolute specialties. My favorite dish, pumpkin blossoms. Here. Okay. This could work. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Okay. It's working. Great. Uh-huh. Wow! It's working. Good. Hmm. So, do you give out a lot of your business cards? Well, I mean, you gotta print 500 to get a discount, right? So, you've made a lot of candlelit dinners. This is the first one in a long time. Let's skip the formalities, I want to know what it is you want out of life? Well, I would love to make a go of this restaurant. And I would like a nice girl in my life. Oh, right. Like, it's very romantic. A little cha-cha with stilettos by the stove while you plate rustic Italian food. Yeah, you know. Nothing wrong with that. If that's what you want. What do you want? Well, I'd like to keep making shoes and keep the legacy of my family's business going. Oh! And, I'd hope to recognize my true love when we meet. No big deal. I would like that, too. I'm thinking maybe, Italian shoemaker? But how do you know that's what you want? Let me put it to you this way. Every morning, I go to the farmer's market and I pick out the ingredients I want to serve up that night. And I like to think that I know what's good on sight. In one look? One look. I know what I like when I see it. Hmm. Well, that's too bad 'cause I don't date Italian men. Why not? They can't be faithful. Oh, no, no. See, that is a terrible generalization. It's my experience and observation and your DNA. Mmm. Mmm. I can't speak for most men. But when I fall in love, I'm a one-woman man. Come on. Your food's getting cold. Well. To dessert, huh? Hello? Hey, you up? Uh... Yeah, I think. Well, can you meet me now? There's a place I want to show you. Oh. I can't. I really, just need to... Whoa! Wait. Why not? Somewhere you gotta be or something? Meet me at South Street. Okay. Be right there. Oof. So, I might just stick with the greens. No, no. Yeah, no... I think we're good. I think if you could just put those in with the rest, that'd be great. Thanks. Hey! You look beautiful! Gosh! Mmm. Hi. Wait, so you woke me up this early to go to the market? Of course I did. This is my favorite time of the day. This is new to you, isn't it? Yeah. Not a morning person. Let's fix that. It's a little late. Ah! Meet me halfway, here. So, I'm gonna start with these. Can I get a... Thanks very much. All right? Okay. Hello. Ciao! All I need are my shoes. Would you mind? If you don't mind? They're divine! Gorgeous. They're just beautiful. Oh, wow. Look at you! Oh, wow. Beautiful. What's all the fuss about? Who made those? I did. And who are you? She's my granddaughter. That doesn't answer my question. We're the Angelini Shoe Company. Come up to my office on the 8th floor when you're finished. Was that Rhedd Lewis? Oh, yeah. She's the big cheese. Not that she eats any. Well, she's as rude as they say she is in the papers. Gram, suck it up. She's the head buyer and the most feared woman in fashion. We've been summoned. We've waited long enough. I give her two minutes. Miss Lewis will see you now. It's about time. Why don't I know you? I've never heard of The Stromboli Shoe Company. Stromboli is a movie starring Ingrid Bergman. We're the Angelini Shoe Company. We've been making wedding shoes since 1903. Miss Lewis, I've read about you. You only work with the greats and you sell the best. We're small, but we make the most exquisite wedding shoes in the world. We use the finest Italian leather and silk. Every seam and button are sewn by hand. Family companies usually stay small for a reason. They lack a world view. We make shoes for our brides, not for the world. I don't have time for small minds or tunnel vision. We have vision. You're a busy woman and our shoes stopped you in your tracks. That must mean something. I'm planning the next windows featuring brides in couture. We'll bring you samples right away. Oh, please. I'm not going to give you the windows. All I can offer you is an opportunity to be featured in a tableau. We'd welcome any opportunity. You'll receive a sketch of a wedding gown. And you will design and build a shoe to go with it. If I like your work, you'll get a shot. But, I'll be honest with you, you'll be up against all the great shoe designers from Milan to Marrakesh. Well, Ms. Lewis, they need to step aside because wait till you see what we can do in Greenwich Village. Come on, Gram. Are you serious? Huh? Okay. Hey! I've got news. Look, Sal, you can't keep sending me that thick cut tenderloin. No, you're killing me. What's that? Bad day? Ah, the worst. My sous chef? He didn't show up. We're down a waiter and the pasta didn't take. This one is the second batch. Ah. What are you doing? I'm pitching in. Linguini or cavatelli? Cavatelli. Mmm-hmm. Okay. I just, uh... I've never had a girlfriend who could roll pasta before. I don't know what shocks me more, that you've had girlfriends that couldn't make pasta or that you just called me your girlfriend. Okay. Not too fast. Right now, you're my angel. Now, tell me about your day. Nothing is more important than you right now. Well... I... We have a leak behind the bar. Except for the leak. Go. Okay. Basta! What is it? Come on. You really saved me tonight. How can I thank you? Someday I may need those gorgeous hands to help me cut leather. I'm only really good in the kitchen. You don't have any other skills? Aw... I wouldn't say that. Might have one or two. Oh! Mmm. Well, this is all well and good. But when there's a shipment, the whole family shows up and helps out, even hotshot chefs might be expected to. Ho-ho! Right. When am I going to meet this family of yours, anyway? I'm hiding them until I'm sure you can endure them. I want to invite them to this first anniversary party. Well, the restaurant's turning one. I'm going to celebrate. I may have something to celebrate, too. Really? I've got a shot at getting my shoes in one of the most coveted windows on Fifth Avenue. That's fantastic. Thank you. Hey, Roman. I've been trying to reach you all day. Hey. When are you going to have time to go through the press plan? Uh... I could do it now. Hi, I'm Sienna Rutledge. Hi. Oh, sorry, this is Valentine. Valentine, this is Sienna. She's, uh... She's the food critic for the New York magazine. She's going to be, uh, covering me, for the anniversary. All my stuff is at the office. Meet me there in half an hour? Nice to meet you. You too. I'm, I'm sorry, but I have to cut this short, I gotta do this, but, um, can I drop you home? Sure. This is important. I get it. Thanks. You got your stuff? Valentine, from Rhedd Lewis. Oh! Here we go! Here we go! Here it is. What is that? It's a wedding gown? It's different. She duped me. It's postmoderno. God. She wants me to fail. Hey, the design takes the past, the traditional chiffon, right? And they've shredded that tradition with a razor. It's an unfinished bride. She should go barefoot. Well, I almost did. What? Why? Go and get the wedding album. I love these stories. Ah! Found it! Oh, let me see. - Oh, Gram! So pretty. - Oh, Gram! The shoe was white satin and the embellishment was made of... saran wrap. What? No way! It rained and it had rained right up to the time I was going to get married. He had an idea. He wanted to cover the shoe but keep it beautiful. Yeah. He made everything his own. That is what a great artist must do. Well, I'm not there yet. I think that this Rhedd Lewis, she make a difficult test for you. That's good. I leave you to your things. Later, Gram. Bye, Gram. So, how are things with Roman? Actually, last night got cut short. He had to go to a meeting with some woman, Sienna something? Sienna Rutledge? Yeah. How did you know? They were a hot couple last year, all over Page 6. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't tops. Give me better than that. We know those carbonaras like yesterday. Let's go, let's go! Thank you, that's better. Someone working on this chocolate mousse? Someone doing that? All right, how's that sauce coming along? I said, 30 seconds, chef. Thank you. You would think someone named Valentine would be good at romance. But you would be wrong. There were more pictures of Sienna and Roman online than there were of J-Lo and A-Rod. It didn't matter how many pictures I found, it was the way she looked at him that bothered me the most. It was time for a sit-down with the chef. So you're saying, what? You can't trust me? I don't know. Can I? I hope so, I mean... Look, the only thing I want you to know is I would never hurt you. Are you done with Sienna? Is there any unfinished business that I need to know about? No. No, it is done. We dated for, like, a year and it's over. We broke up. Swear to God. How do I know you're not just one of those guys? I mean, according to my sisters and, maybe, Google, your romantic carbon footprint is like a size 11. You can trust me. Do you promise? Yes, I promise. I swear to God. I am not one of those guys. Let's go out. Go out? Let's go out! Come on! What? Let's go dancing. I want to dance the night away! Oh, yeah? With you. What is Alfred doing here? And why did he bring security? That's a real estate broker. Let's see what the man has to say. Gram, you don't need some sleazy broker to tell you what you're worth. Gram, this is, uh, Scott Hatcher. We went to Cornell together. Nice to meet you. It's lovely to make your acquaintance, ma'am. I think perhaps we should start on the roof. I'm afraid that won't be necessary. I'm not interested in the house. Oh. Now, don't get me wrong. It's a lovely place you got here, but it's the lot that's valuable. Could I possibly talk to you in private? No. Ah, we are all family here. Okay. I would like to buy 166 Perry Street for $10 million. Cash. Wow. Wow. Valentine? You didn't say goodbye to your brother. Mmm. Please forgive me. I was too busy saying goodbye to my future. But as long as Alfred gets his way, all is well. I don't like tit for tat. Especially in my adult grandchildren. Okay, let me make it easy for you. Just take the money and get it over with. $10 million could make a big difference in this family, could do a lot of good. I have a right to consider this offer. I've worked hard all my life. Yeah, you... You really have. But I know much this business means to you. You know how to create. But you have to make the business work financially. If you do, I will reconsider this offer. Veramente, amore, I will. You are a smart woman. You can figure it out. Hey. So, how's it coming? I can't crack this Rhedd Lewis shoe. Hmm. Well, the shelves are bare, and we don't have a lot of leather or fabric. We need supplies. Hmm. Well, you'll get what we need when you go on your supply run to Italy. Would you like to come with me? What? Gram, you've insisted on going alone every year since I can remember. When? You call it "Bella Mia Time." Si. What happened? You lonely? No. I always find my bliss and inspiration in Italy. Maybe... Maybe for you, it would be good. Would you come? Yes. If you're asking, I'm going. Pound it. Very handsome. Hey! Hello, everybody. Alfred is parking. Mom, you look incredible. In fact, you look younger than me. And I'm not sure I'm happy with that. What do you want from me? Get a new haircut. I'm going to get a new haircut. But first I gotta get some hair. Sorry I'm late. Hey, Pop. Oh, Alfred. Hey. Parking around here is impossible. Hey, Mom. You're looking great. Uh, family? This is Roman. Roman, the family. Nice to meet you all, finally. Congratulations, Roman. Mwah. I wear this jacket to honor you. I'm very touched. Thank you, Teodora. It's nice to see you. And I hope you enjoy tonight. It's gonna be, uh, hopefully a good time. Have some mix of food for you, a little spread. Tried anything yet? I've tried everything. Is it all right? Hey, Roman. It's time. Okay. Sorry, guys. I'm going to have to leave for just one sec. Ooh, that's her. Whew. Okay. All right, guys, I don't want to take up much of your attention, but, uh, just wanted to welcome you to Ca' d'Oro. It's our first-year anniversary. Now, Ca' d'Oro, that's translated, that means "House of Gold," which is not lost on this beautiful lady here. It's nice to see. Truth is, I want to be able to give you the best dining experience in the city. So, if you like it, tell everybody, tell your friends, and if you don't, just pretend you weren't here. Ah, I'm not serious but, uh, thank you for coming. Most important thing tonight? Have a good time and salute. Salute. What, no macaroni? I'm sorry. No macaroni... Who brought this guy? I can bring you a kids' menu if you want? Oh! You know how much I'm going to miss you when I go to Italy? I think you already showed me. Mmm. Hey. How about, um, I come and visit you after you're finished working? No. You're too busy. Uh... I'm sure the restaurant can survive without me for a little while. You mean it? Mmm-hmm. 'Cause I will plan a romantic vacation. Do it. It'll be fun. Bella Italia. The hillsides of Tuscany look like bolts of green taffeta. And my great-grandfather's villa sits like a shimmering gold crown on the mountaintop. I wish I could say the same about this car. - Whup. - Yup, oh, oh. Hold on, Gram. Okay. So we can trade your stick shift for an automatic first chance we get. It's here. It's here, it's here. It's perfect. Okay. Oh, man. That car bucked so bad, I didn't know whether to park it on the street or in the barn. Oof. Teodora! Hello, hello, hello. I am so happy to... You look like una movie star. No, no, no. This is my granddaughter, beautiful Valentine. Ciao. This was once the Angelini Shoe Company. Your great-grandfather used to work on the ground level, and live upstairs with the family. Like us. Si. And see, they didn't bulldoze the building. Sometimes things change, even if you don't want them to. Mmm, don't remind me. So, we are coming to the tannery. Oh! Nice, no? Yes. Oh, man, it looks like a storybook cottage. Let's come back, please, this is... Domenico. Teodora! Okay. Ah, you too, Signor Vechiarelli. Mmm. This is my son, Gianluca. Nice to meet you. How fabulous. You're speaking Italian already! Please, come on. Please. Oh, okay. Thank you. Please, please, come on. May I borrow your grandmother? It's fine with me if it's all right with her. We must catch up. Come on. Catch up on what? They talk on the phone every night. For hours. Mmm. I'm really sorry you heard me and my dad argue. No problem. Working with family can be life-threatening. I didn't know you were on our Christmas card list. Ah, yes. Your family is very important to my father. Well, if he wants to adopt them, I will gladly sign the papers. Do your brother and sisters work in the business? No. Not interested. But they have opinions, right? About everything. How did you know? Famiglia. Family. Mmm-hmm. My brother thinks I was given the business, therefore I don't deserve it. Mmm. Are you married? Not yet. Maybe that's why your brother doesn't take you seriously, because you don't have a husband. Okay, is this 2019 or 1920? I insulted you. I just don't think a husband would solve my problems. Well, my wife didn't solve mine. What? What happened? She wanted to live in Florence. I wanted to stay here. So you chose your father and the tannery over your wife? No, she chose Florence and a man named Vincenzo over me. I feel lucky tonight. - You want two. - Yes. Pick a card. Not the best way to start. Hmm. Ooh. Oops. Gram, aren't you tired? What can I say? There is something in the air, in the water, makes me feel like I can go on! Or he's sitting at the table next to her. I'm going to walk back to the hotel. Okay, ciao, amore. Ciao. Ciao. I'll walk with you. Ciao. Gram, don't take Domenico's last euro. Mmm. My grandmother's a card shark and she cheats. I heard that. I always wonder what it's like for Italian-Americans when they come here. Do you recognize it as your own? Anywhere with cobblestone streets is home to me. You came to Italy for more than supplies, didn't you? Doesn't everybody? I'm going to take that as a sign. A moon so silver it's white. Mmm. Be sure and close your curtains. You should never sleep with the moon shining on you. Bad luck. Oh. Buona notte. Good night. Tomorrow. Yeah. Superstitious Italians. Hey. Hi. How's it going without me? Oh, it's terrible. It's no fun making pasta without you here. Well, you keep having no fun until you get here. I can't wait to be with you in every villa on the coast. In every feather bed. Mmm. Better. No, really. I can't wait. Yeah, neither can I. And evidently, it's in the DNA. I'm not the only single girl in my family in a hot romance. Gram has a boyfriend and spent the night at his house. I hope I have a nice thing going like that when I'm her age. Yeah, well, hopefully it's with me. You got nothing to worry about. All right, I gotta go but, uh, I'll speak to you soon. Okay, bye. Gram... Si? You're busted. No. I saw you this morning with Domenico. Brava nonna! Sexy Italian time on the Via Spolti. I went out for a walk. In yesterday's outfit? Domenico really help me when your grandfather die. I felt guilty at first. But then I thought about it. If I had been the one to go first, I would have wanted him to have happiness in his life again. Not too quickly. If we live long enough, we are lucky. Maybe we can have a second chance. Gram, pack your things and go and stay with Domenico. You should enjoy yourself while you're here. What happens in Italy stays in Italy. It's beautiful. Do you think you could teach me how to do that? It took me years to master it. I've been practicing in New York and I'm a pretty fast learner. Okay. Thank you. Mmm-hmm. Okay, it's going to take some time. Give it to me. Oh... So, how do you like your new roommate? Whatever makes my dad happy. Oh, he's happy. Tell me about your shoe you want to design. Okay. This is my last chance to put Angelini Shoes on the map in a big way, or I lose everything. What do you mean, you lose everything? This trip is either a triumph or a swan song for our shoe shop. What will happen to you? I don't want to think about it. I don't want to leave our home. Our roof terrace. What's so special about your roof terrace? My garden. My tomatoes. We make our own sauce. My swing, my childhood memories, running around up there. The view of New Jersey. It's just sky and air and peace. I can show you places here to think and dream. Ta-da! You got me to the nunnery. Only temporarily. Although I would actually consider taking the veil if they let me live some place like this. Yes, but you would give up making... Love? I was thinking of shoes. Right. Oh, wow. Are we allowed to talk? Okay. I guess they punted the old vow of silence. Right. Show me everything, don't hold back, I know people at the Vatican. Not really. I just want to leave here knowing how to emboss leather. And if that doesn't work out, you can always teach me how to weave sandals. Hmm. Yup. And that, my holy men in robes, is what I like to call "embossing." Just as Gram had promised, I slowly began to find my inspiration in Italy. I began to see things differently. Or maybe I just saw things clearly. But whatever was happening, I began to experience a particular beauty in the world that I had never seen before. And I couldn't wait to share it with Roman. Valentina? You're out very early. Yeah, so are you. Okay, so, big news. I designed the shoe. That's amazing. I saw it in my dreams, and then I woke up and just drew it. And you know what? I love it. It's kind of a miracle. You're right. There's something about Italy. It's not the landscape, it's you. You know, lots of people see things in their dreams, but they cannot bring them to life. That's a special skill. Want a ride? You know what? Yeah, let's go. You know, I've eaten so much pasta, I could probably run to Bergamo and back and not work it off. You're perfect as you are. That compliment just earned you a cup of coffee. Oh, sorry. Espresso! Oh, my God! Grazie. Thank you for the coffee. Any time. Ciao, Vale. Hey, Roman. I was just thinking about you. Guess what? I designed the shoe. That's great. That's awesome. Yeah, it's been an amazing trip. It's so beautiful here. I cannot wait to see you. Yeah, listen, that's kind of why I'm calling. Um, I just got great news. What do you mean? New York magazine wants to do a profile on me. Wow, That's great. I mean, they only cover the stars so... Yeah, yeah. After Sienna covered the party, they asked her to, you know, do a profile on me, follow me around the restaurant and home kind of thing. You mean when you get back? Yes, that's just the thing, Val, um... They're, uh, they're doing it all week so, um, I can't go to Italy. Listen, Italy's not going anywhere, you know, we've got everything ahead of us, so... And it's the cover of New York magazine so I gotta do it. You understand, right? I'm so sorry, Val. Yeah, I am, too. Uh, okay, Roman, I gotta go. Gram! Gram! Gram. Gram, where are you? I need you. Oh, mother of God! Valentine. Oh, wow. I am gonna be scarred. Gonna scar me for life. Oh! I'm gonna go. Valentine. Gram, I should go. Come here. Calm down. Calm down. Stop it. You're being silly. Gram, it's not that. I mean, it's a little bit of that. Amore. What happened? New York magazine is doing a profile on Roman, a cover story. But? Sienna is writing it. And? He isn't coming to Italy. He'll be with her the whole time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, darling, I'm sorry. Go away. Signora, I really can't do... I heard what happened. You have a gallon of grappa? I think I can do better than that. Wow. Why didn't you show me this before? You love your roof so much, I didn't think my garden would compare. Oh, it compares. I'm sorry about your trip. Well, it was bound to happen. Things were going too well, and then I probably slept with the moon hitting me and here we are. Bad luck. Maybe you are just overreacting. Maybe. Or maybe my gut is telling me that my boyfriend is going to get back with his ex. I don't want you to leave Italy this way. You have to leave better than when you arrived. Let's build your shoe. Tonight? Si. Insieme. Together. Hmm? Let's not waste your last night here being sad. Um, do you have Duchess satin? I have something better. My mother made this years ago. I've been waiting for a design worthy of her memory. It's yours. What? Are you sure? Yes. Thank you. They're perfect. Mmm. We're a good team. Will you do something for me? Remember the night. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Your nonna is so sad. Thank you. Finally, help. I can help. Oh, thank you. Okay. Give me the little one. Bye! Okay, Gram, we should get going. We are going, we are going. Ciao, Domenico. Ciao. Have a good trip. My love. Oh. Okay. What do you think? Oh, Val. Louboutin can kiss your foot. Sistah, I guarantee you Rhedd Lewis has never seen anything like this. Hmm. Well, Gianluca says that the right shoe can change everything. Yeah, well, don't believe everything he says. And don't trust those Italians from the other side. Your gram used to warn me about them. They've got their head in the clouds and their feet in the grapes. Hmm. I have a feeling she might have changed her mind about that. Hey, good luck! God help me. I feel lucky. Hi. Hi. These shoes are for Rhedd Lewis, for consideration for the next bridal windows. I'll put them over here. Great article. Not so great if it means you won't talk to me. I know I disappointed you, Val. But you gotta understand... I can't stand being apart from you. I love you. Can you handle loving me when I'm sad? Because I'm... I'm miserable. I dropped off the shoes today. There were hundreds of submissions. I'll never be in the window. I'm sorry, Val. But, hey, you don't have... You've nothing to worry about. You know, it's just shoes. We still got each other. You know? You're a natural in the kitchen, I'm telling you, you're gonna have a beautiful future by my side at Ca' d'Oro. If you want it. So, how about you come back with me, I'll make you dinner. Not tonight. I just... I have a lot of stuff I need to figure out. Good night. Yeah, good night. Oh, my God. Gram! Gram. Are you okay? Gram! Are you... Oh, my God! Hi, yes, my grandmother is unconscious! 166 Perry Street. Oh, my God. Gram, Gram. Hey, the doc. Oh. Good news, folks. Teodora didn't suffer from a stroke. From what I could tell, she slipped on the stairs, fell and hit her head, and she's suffering from a mild concussion. So we are going to keep her for observation. She's a little shaken up, but she's gonna be just fine. Oh. Thank you, Doctor. I could kiss you. Haven't we had enough drama for one night? Well, call me if you need me. Thank you. Good night. Hi. You didn't have to sit there waiting for me. I wanted to. Thank you. How do you feel? I feel like I got a kick in the head. And I feel lucky. I've been doing a lot of thinking. Gram, it's not worth it. You can't keep running up and down those stairs. I'm being selfish. Retire and sell the building. You don't mean that. With all of my heart. It's time that you live your life the way you want to. You know what I'm gonna miss when you sell the building? Us. I saw Roman. He says he loves me and wants to spend his life with me. Good. That's my dream for you. To be loved. You know, a lot of wonderful things happened to me at work. But... nothing could top the time I spent with your grandfather, your mother, and you kids upstairs. You have to be happy upstairs. That is where you live and that is where you love. My love. I came as soon as Valentine called me. I just pressed two on speed dial. Oh. Good to see you. How you feel now? I feel good now. I couldn't let Papa make the trip alone. Is that where you make the shoes? Yeah. You want to see it now? Could I? I love it. It has character. Hmm. It's old. It's not old. It's beautiful. Well, even beauty doesn't last forever. Neither will this shop. Gram's decided to sell the building. I'm sorry. Let's go. Here's your room. And the bathroom is down the hall. Where will you be? Okay, let's dial down the flirt mode. Um, we had a kiss in Italy and that was wrong. I'm with Roman. So, now that you have met all the family, what do you think? Big and beautiful. We have a little secret. What? You're getting married? I didn't even know you were dating. Grandma. What did I miss? Thank you. Thank you. Well... It's our little secret. Congratulations, sir. Well, that covers just about everything. We'll get signatures through our lawyers by the end of the month. Everything good, yeah? So, if you need anything further over the weekend, just call me. I can clarify whatever doesn't make sense. Uh, but that's the lot. You're doing the right thing, Val. Okay? I'll have the sales contract ready for Gram by the time she gets home. Hatcher will take over the building on March 1st. Okay? These are for you. Thanks. Um, there's just one more thing... Yeah? Will you help take the sign down from outside? It's been there since the beginning and I... No problem. I know how tough this is for you. Oh, God... So, this is the end? Yeah. I don't want to talk about it. You haven't wanted to talk at all. I'm sorry. I just want to understand one little thing. Why are you quitting? Maybe you don't have to. Gianluca, you're a dreamer. So are you. I was. But you can't pin your hopes on dreams that will never come true. You don't know what fate has in store for you. You don't know. I'll find happiness with Roman. Help me pack up this leather? I know a good tanner in Italy that could sell it to the Ferragamos. Let's go. It's a good one. It's a good one. We have four bottle, I hope it's enough. Please, yes, you put it there by the water jug. Move the jug and could you put one up there and then one down here. Everybody, come and sit down, sit down, guys. Sit down. Everybody here? I'm hungry. Oh, this is simpatico, no? It's simpatico. It's fantastic. Dutch, would you, per favore, lead us in prayer? Dear Lord, we gather for Sunday dinner on Perry Street. While we won't be here much longer, we will still gather every Sunday as we always have because that's what it means to be family. Lord, it's been a hell of a year. Gram went kaboom, huh? And now she's got a new fiance. Go figure. Not bad for a woman of a certain age. Hey! What? What? Gianluca, benvenuto. It's nice to have you with us. Thank you. And Roman, you've brought some grade A limoncello to the proceedings. Bene, huh? But, more importantly, you make my Funny One laugh, so Grazie and welcome to our table. All right, amen. Amen. Amen. Buon appetito. Buon appetito. Ah, I'll get it. I ordered an extra case of wine. It's rude to stare. I'm here about the shoes you made. You saw my shoes? Out of that huge pile? Your shoes are magnificent. Every stitch was perfect. The design original and courant. The materials you chose were surprising and fun. You are in the windows. Oh, my God! What the hell was that? What's happened? Oh! She picked my shoes for the window! Congratulations! Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Gram. The windows are only part of the reason I'm here. I want to put Angelini shoes in all of our stores. How soon can you produce a line? About three months. Well, we need a backer. If Miss Lewis puts in an order for your shoes, I can find the financing. Alfred! Thanks. Well, get a move on. I want a line ready by next spring. Ah, okay. Alfredo, go get the bill of sale. All right. You guys! This is for you. Oh! Oh, my goodness. Congratulations! Oh, ho, ho. Gram. When things get tense in the kitchen at Ca' d'Oro, you always take a break on the stoop in the back alley. That's one of the things I love about you. Nothing gets past you, huh? That's great news about the shoes. Congratulations. You mean it? Yeah. Yeah, I do. But I don't know what it means for us. I don't know, I had this, uh... Had a stupid dream it would just be you and me, side by side, building the restaurant, rolling pasta. Creating a life together. It's pretty crazy when one person's dream comes at the expense of another. I'd never make you choose. You know that. But the truth is you made it pretty clear that I should give up what I loved. Hmm. But... but I thought you loved me. But... I guess I wasn't being completely honest. I was being who I thought you needed and not who I really am. All this time I was a little insecure. Now I know that in the moment I needed you the most, you didn't believe in me. But I love you. And I love you. And love can do a lot of things. But it can't turn a shoemaker into a sous chef. Goodbye, Valentine. Where are you going? Home. I've got to get back to my life. My shop, my garden. But I have a line of shoes to design for the fall. Anybody can help you with that. No, not anybody. You can call me. I'll help you. What are you doing? I have a ticket. Return it. I cannot. I live in another country, I have a business. It's impossible. Come on. But this is, this is not about business. What is it about? It's about us. I went to Italy to find inspiration, and I found it. But I think I found more than that. I found someone I want to share my life with. I found you. I knew from the first time I saw you that I want to build a life with you. I... Um... And so, the tradition continues on Perry Street. We make custom wedding shoes, we fall in love, and we make promises that last a lifetime. It seems so simple but it's not. Luckily, I have Gram. She's shown me how to love by example, never give up and pay attention. Because when love finds you you must pour everything you are into the process. And just like making a pair of shoes, stitch by stitch, seam by seam, the love you build will become a work of art that will take you places you've never dreamed, one step at a time. You may kiss the bride. Yeah, Gram! You're married. I learned from her.
