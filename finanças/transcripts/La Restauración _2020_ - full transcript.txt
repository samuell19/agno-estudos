[waves crashing] [mysterious music] [Tato] There is no doubt that Peru is a country of builders. Our architectural glory may have peaked during the Incan empire... But this humble servant was lucky enough to see a new era. One that was, perhaps, even bigger. [bright pop music] In the mid 2000s, when the economy grew, many old houses were demolished and were replaced by large residential projects. Whether they were pretty or ugly, it didn't matter. The point was that we were building once again! [bright pop music] The dream of home ownership was available to more Peruvians than in any other time in our history. But in life, everything comes at a cost. Just as people that used to be poor were now getting rich, families that used to be rich were now broke. [ominous music] And that was me: Tato Basile. Focused on the two things that I enjoyed the most. Architectural models and the consumption of our signature national commodity. [sniffing] I still don't quite understand why my wife left me. But I had no other choice than to come back to my mom's house. To my childhood bedroom. [whimsical music] And just as my family's fortune had run out... I was also running out of ways of sustaining my humble lifestyle. [Gloria] Take good care of it. Don't worry, I will. [door closes] [Tato] Gloria, what is that? I am sorry, young man. Then what do I do? Gloria, you know I can't work, I am psychologically incapable. That was never in question. Gloria, you put so many bills in there, no one will notice if one is missing. No, Tato! We don't have money. This has to get us through April. And don't you tell Mrs. Rosa anything. [melancholic music] [Tato sighs] [melancholic piano music] [Rosa] What do you want? Money? That's the only reason you ever come to this part of the house. Me? No! [Rosa] Gloria, make sure the girl holds my legs up high. I don't want to piss myself like last time. [Gloria] Come here, Inez. I haven't recovered from the divorce yet, Mom, it's a long process. [scoffs] Of course... Too long. I still wonder how she could put up with a useless alcoholic for so long. [laughs] But it's better that she left you, son. She was a social climber. [chuckles] Hurry up, damn it! [groaning] There, there! [urinating] It's a short term loan Mom, I need to buy a new sweater. My God, what a disaster. Gloria, get the box. [groaning] Buy a blue sweater. It suits you. Thank you, Mom. [kiss] Leave him a Xanax and a glass of water. Let's see if he can sleep after all the coke he is about to take. [soft piano music] [car door closes] [King Arthur] You are not mad at me, right? [Tato] Why? I don't know. I would have kept you on a tab but business is slow right now. - I feel bad. - [Tato] No, Arturo, please... Look. You are the only person in all of Lima that I can give my money to without feeling dirty. These days everyone is corrupt. Everyone. We're fucked. [can pops open] [sighs] Tato? Tato Basile? Hey, madman! [laughing] Oh... Raymond. [laughing] I don't see you in 20 years and you already want to go? It's just that my mom is waiting at home for the stuff from the bodega. For the whiskey? Yes, she loves her whiskey nowadays. Come on, man, just take a look at our work. [whirring, clattering] [pensive music] [Tato] This was just like making models in my bedroom. Only a bit more real. And more profitable. [Raymond] We design, we build, we create debtors... No! People have money now. Investments are paying off big time. I don't know, too risky for me. I prefer mutual funds. [Raymond laughs] How is your wife? Look, we are throwing a little party tomorrow. Housewarming party. Congrats! You idiot, I'm inviting you. A party? I don't know... Come on, man, there will be lots of free drinks. Then we can catch up. I'll let you know. Right now, I have to get this whiskey to my mom. Yeah, yeah, get out of here! Nice building, though! [Raymond chuckles] [whimsical music] [Tato] I don't like lentils, Gloria! [Gloria] Food is food. [phone rings] [phone rings] Hello? Wrong number, sir. I don't know what you're talking about. Goodbye. Is it city hall again? [Gloria] They never give up. How much do we owe them? [Gloria] You don't want to know. [Rosa] Gloria, tell the girl to bring me my sherry! - [Gloria] I'm coming! - [sniffing] [sniffing] [trippy music] [dance music] Shit, average people... I can't stand them. Are you staying? I'm afraid, Eladio. You should go, young man. Will you come with me? [dance music] Tato! I'm so glad you made it. Welcome! Have a drink. Thanks. Gentlemen, allow me the pleasure of introducing you to the great Tato. Nice to meet you. Do you live in the building? No, I still live with my mom. But you should see the house, on Gallicias Street. Gallicias? There are only 2 houses left there. A green one and a... Mine is the older one. Come, brother, I'll show you around my new building. Do you like it? I gave myself the penthouse, why not? Drink, everyone. It's free, for fuck's sake! [people cheering] What do you think? Beautiful view, right? Perfect for watching fireworks. [chuckles] Fireworks, the golf course... Before, you could see the ocean. Now, all I see is a lot of money. [laughing] No, really... I believe what I have isn't just due to hard work or luck. [sighs] I think it's a gift from God. A blessing from above. [kiss] Right. Do you have any.. Of course! Coco! Offer our guest a bit of creme brulee. No, thank you. Here you are. Excuse me, boys. [sniffing] Let's go. [intriguing music] [sniffing] [dance music] [Galia] You know Raymond would buy your house in a heartbeat, right? It's not mine to sell. Do you have siblings? No. None that I know of. Then it's your house. Not yet. What a pity. Soon it might be too late. You mean all of this is going to hell? [chuckles] Well, no one can say. But one thing is clear... the time to sell is now. Think it over. [pensive music] [fireworks whistling, crackling] [Rosa] Absolutely not! Why? Over my dead body, Tato. And I mean, literally. You can do whatever you want with the house after I die. Won't be long. Don't say that, Mrs. Rosa. It's fine, we all die someday. But I want to do it in this room, it's not too much to ask. And what if we're broke? You may be broke, not us. [sighs] Don't go saying that nonsense. This family has never been broke, and never will be. Right, Gloria? We're fine, as always. See? You should take care of your home. Instead, you want to sell it to some jerk. So he can make a tacky building for 500 social climbers. All so they can say: "I live in San Isidro." Don't say that about Raymond, he's my friend. Friends don't ask you to sell your family home. - It was my idea. - It's a bad idea! [Rosa] Enough already! You've never had good ideas. Much less now. [melancholic music] Go buy yourself a pair of pants. Do me that favor. He'll get over it. [elevator bell dings] She is very interested. I swear! But she wants to know the terms... Your Botox appointment is at 3 p.m. - Make it 5 p.m. - [secretary] Okay. You know she is a bit finicky. We can put together a proposal, but... Are you sure she wants to sell? She has lived there her whole life. She's dying to sell! I followed your advice... I just spoke to the owner of the Galicias house. - Present! - The other one. What did he say? He wants to sell. Fuck yeah! [cheering, kiss] [chuckling] Right, let me show you some changes I want to make to the design. - [Raymond] Yeah, sure. - Raymond. See, Tato? No problem. We found another house. But I'm offering you mine. [Raymond] You just told me that your mom isn't sure. She will sell. She doesn't even leave her room. Let's do this. Convince her in the next couple of days, and we go with you instead. [Galia] Right, so we have the entrance on this side, and... [clattering] [soft pensive music] [mysterious music] [suspenseful music] King Arthur... No, no, no. Well, that too, but I have another question. You still own that plot of land south of Lima? King Arthur... That day has come. [suspenseful music] Gloria, what's this? From city hall. [intriguing music] To Mrs. Rosa Basile de la Canal... Due to your consistent negligence in paying property taxes... accumulated over 20 years and your disconnection from the reality of our country, the house located at 200 Galicias Street is to be vacated on the 30th of March unless the payment is made in full before this date. But today is the 30th of March. That's why I'm here. This is a joke, right? I assure you, we won't damage the furniture, ma'am. But we never received any notice. - All our notices are registered. - Where? This is crazy. Gloria, go sit down. I'll deal with this guy. [door slams] What is this fraud? How did I do? I always wanted to be an actor. You have committed a grave offense against an important family. Pay in a week or vacate the house! Otherwise, we will bring the military. [car alarm beeps] [car door closes] We have until Monday. What help is that? My mom knows nothing about our debts? If she knew, she'd have a heart attack. [sighs] Well. Gloria, it's not your fault. It was impossible to keep a lie going forever, what you have done is already amazing. Sure. Even so, it is still my fault. We're going to lose the house. Listen, we can always sell the house. Sell the house? That we cannot do. This house is the only thing that gives her pride. [ominous music] We're screwed. [Tato] Gloria. My mother doesn't have to know a single thing. Her bedroom will be here. This was the idea? This is the idea, and it's perfect. I should have guessed. We're right next to the highway, we can get to the hospital faster than in the city with all the traffic. And it's far away enough for the city hall to find us. We don't have all of that city noise my mother hats so much, either. We can get electricity from there. [Gloria] What about water? Water? We'll build a tank. The way they do in shanty towns. [Gloria] What? You want to bring your mother to a squatter settlement? A really nice one! [slap] We aren't going to get the money we need in time. - Let me go. - Gloria, we can't save the house. It's over. We can't maintain a house like that with no money. Be realistic. But, if we can sell it we can gather enough money to give my mom all of the comforts she deserves until the inevitable happens. They will pay us 5 times more than what we owe in taxes. That way we can pay the debt, you can buy sherry and lamb for my mom every day... And a bit of cocaine for you... No, Gloria! This is 98% for the good of my mother. She'll never know the difference, she never leaves her room, you know that. I don't know. I don't like the idea. Me neither. Either way, who would build the room? I can do it. [pensive music] [Gloria] Alright, alright. That's for materials and labor only. Eladio... You must build a room exactly like Mrs. Rosa's. Do you understand? Identical. I need to make something clear. The project we are taking on is not only illegal. It is also very complicated. But we will do it for Mrs. Rosa. Because we love her. That is why I need each of you to give me your word. That you truly understand what you are agreeing to. [Inez] Will there be cell service. There's an antenna. And remember, please Mrs. Rosa must never under any circumstance find out about any of this. [pensive music continues] Fuck, Tato. Tell me. What's going on? My mother died. Tato. Are you serious? God... Well, now... the house is available. Don't you think you should wait a little bit before making any decisions? As you can imagine, my family has quite a bit of debt. Now that the house is mine I would like to get it taken care of as soon as possible. I understand. And when is the funeral? Funeral? In a few days. Let me know. Of course. [whimsical music [Rosa] Inez! Hurry up with the sherry! It's just Xanax, Gloria, she gives them to me all the time. Tato, is there no way of doing this without telling everyone that she is dead? Nobody would believe she would sell the house. Besides, the buyer is coming to the funeral. We have to hurry up, it starts in three hours. [ominous music] Dr. Moreyra, how good to see you. My condolences, son. Your mother was very special to me. I always knew you cared for her... Romantically. Well, perhaps, in my youth. I believe that she cared for you too. Right until the end. [melancholic violin music] Thank you, son. Aunt Doris. I'm so glad you could make it. I'm very happy for you, son. You have a great property with which to start anew. That's the last thing on my mind. Don't say that. Your future could depend on this property. Sometimes you need your parents gone in order to start living your own life. Excuse me, Aunt Doris. Condolences, brother. Rosa was a brilliant woman. And beautiful, as I told her many times. But, in the end... She chose my best friend as husband. And together, they accomplished many great things. Among them, a great son. [chuckling] [Moreyra] Rosa believed we had a duty to protect our values, our culture, our appreciation for the arts. In short, our tradition. [applauding] Protect them from new members of our society... Who only want to get rich quickly. Don't listen to him. People who, without meaning to, are putting these values and tradition in danger. Rosa also left behind this house. The Basile house. One of the last houses standing from the Republican era of Peru. Irreplaceable. I know Rosa would have wanted for this house to be preserved. Or better yet, that it be restored. [melancholic music] [muffled screams, knocking] [rattling] [Tato] Everyone, please stay calm. These phenomena are normal in this house. As Dr. Moreyra was saying, important people have lived here. People like my mother who is no longer with us and... who, maybe, has decided to manifest herself in this moment. Maybe it was the neighbor, who sometimes screams when she showers. It's clear the neighborhood is not what it used to be. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... For all the noise. Eladio, pass out some snacks. Tato, may we speak in private for a moment? Yes. [Moreyra] Lima's Preservation Society cannot match an offer from the real estate industry. What we can offer you is the opportunity to sleep with a clean conscience. I don't know if you understand how important this is. Of course I understand... History... Traditions... Colonial supremacy... If not for loyalty to your class, you must consider our offer for the memory of your mother. I don't want an answer now, just think about it. Mmm? We're going through the mourning process, but when it's over, I'll think it about it. I promise. Thank you, my friend. [bright pop rock music] So, I get half of the payment now plus an apartment for myself, and another one for Gloria and Eladio. That's right, and then, two more apartments in the new building. [Raymond] You have to look at it from another angle. Alright, a historic home will come down. A pity, but... The dream of owning a home will come true for 120 families. It's a beautiful thing. Beautiful and profitable. And my new apartment... Could it be a penthouse? [laughing] These things can help with the grieving process. Of course. They always help. I will do my best. [laughs] One more signature here. [clears throat] Are you sure you don't prefer a bank transfer? No, this is fine. The only thing I ask is that the house be ready on the date that we agreed upon. You know how complicated it is to coordinate a demolition. Of course. I got it. [Galia] I will see the rest of the project from you tomorrow, then? Thank you. Congratulations! Thanks, congratulations to you, too. This will be our best project yet. Well, that's not really a compliment. Did I tell you Tato is also an architect? No, I didn't even graduate. Well, it's never too late. No, it wasn't for me. Well, I better get going. I have to coordinate the move... It's a lot of work. [Galia] Of course. Off to work you go! [Tato] My debts are paid. [King Arthur] As a token of my gratitude... A little present. [soft pensive music] [Tato] Peru was moving forward. For the first time in my life I gave the impression of being a respectable citizen. Look what I brought you, Mom. Your favorite. [clears throat] What's wrong? You look like a social climber. It's a fine suit, Mom. Do you like it? It's horrible. It's shiny. Let go. It's fashionable. And look, it's blue! Yeah, blue... Fluorescent blue. [Rosa] Tato, are you selling drugs? Tell me the truth. No. Gloria, give me the box. Quick! Take it. - For what? - What do you mean? You are still making stupid decisions. You don't need easy money. And that's not easy? Family wealth is never easy money. You should know that by now. It doesn't matter that you are useless. This money is yours. By birthright. You're just confused. Your head up in the clouds. When you get over your divorce, you'll make better decisions. Now let me and Gloria take care of you. It's for the best. It's for the best, my son. [pensive music] [door bell rings] Fernando Basile? - "Tato." - What? They call me "Tato." What do you want? I'm here from Palacios Real Estate to... Lower your voice, please. I'm here from Palacios Real Estate to verify that no one lives here. We are here to pick up reusables, like toilets, tiles... [Tato] I understand, but can't you see we still live here? Right... We aren't ready, I'll talk to Raymond. [suspenseful music] I'm so sorry. Contract, date. I swear I didn't know. No kidding? Eladio. Is everything ready? The room, Eladio. The room! [tense music] Yes or no? [Tato] We need six hours, OK? Three. [car engine revs] Hold the head higher. Higher! Be careful! [ominous music] [pensive music] [suspenseful music] [tense music] Eladio. You like it? Do you realize that this looks nothing like Mrs. Rosa's bedroom? - No? - No, Eladio! What is this? What is this wallpaper? It was a Portuguese design from the 1800s. [sighs] Oh my God. The bronze light fixtures, look! Where are they? That's just a miserable bulb! The moldings? This is clearly plywood! The window... You can see the desert, Eladio. Couldn't you have put more thought into it? Do you think that she'll believe that this is her room? Do you think that she's stupid? Answer me! OK, Gloria, that's enough. Enough, Eladio. You did a great job. The door is great, the window is great. Getting everything perfect was going to be hard. You did what we asked, and you did it with dignity. It looks like it... kind of. It doesn't look like it at all. Look. The plan is off. Gloria, be more understanding. [Gloria] I understand everything. I finally understand. This won't work. We can't do this. We must take Mrs. Rosa home immediately. We can't! [Gloria] What do you mean "we can't"? Tato... Dr. Moreyra said the Lima Preservation Society could restore the house. That's it! A restoration! Yes! It's the right thing to do. Gloria, Eladio. I think I have a solution. [groaning] [suspenseful music] I'm in Hell. Finally. [Tato] Sorry, Mom you're alive. You were sleeping so soundly, we didn't want to wake you up. Where am I? In your bedroom, Mom, as always. [Rosa] What are these curtains? There will be changes, Mom, but... That's a good thing. Oh, shit. The Lima Preservation Society has decided to restore the house. What? [Tato] Yes. A restoration. They decided the house is historically significant, which it is. They want to restore it so it can look like it did in the old days. Before the country went to shit. They've already started. It will look amazing! And just who decided this? Well, I did. Since when do you make decisions in this house? I thought you'd like the idea, and Gloria did too. Right, Gloria? Mom, you will love it. Now everyone decides what I will love other than me! This is different... Look at this. This is what it will look like when it's finished. [soft melancholic music] It's been so long since I've seen this photo. It's from 1966. Great times. Yes, before you were born. [sighs] Lima was beautiful. Lima was beautiful. There were none of those buildings outside... And no plastic curtains either! Eladio was already working with us. Best gardener we ever had. It's been a while since I smelled the neighbor's beef stew. It smelled horrible, remember? It was terrible. Strange as it sounds... I wouldn't mind smelling it again. I haven't heard the woman that sells tamales in a while. She must be old, like me, no? Woman that sells tamales...? Isn't she dead? The important thing is that the Preservation Society loves the house. They want to restore the interiors, including your bedroom... I told them it was fine. That's why they put up the plastic while you slept. They're horrible, I know. Well, Gloria, you made the right decision. Gloria? But it was my idea! [Rosa] Please, Tato... What are you waiting for? Set up the fucking wheelchair. I want to see their work. [all] No, no, no. What do you mean, no? No way, they're working right outside of the door, it's a mess out there. How are they working if I hear nothing? Look, I think it's time for your pills for your circulation. What pills? What circulation, Gloria? [whispering] You have to do something, now! [Rosa] I want to see my house! [wind blowing] [thudding] - Do I press play? - Yes. [loud music plays] Jesus Christ, what is that? [music stops] What are you doing? I'm sorry, I put in the B-side! [restoration's sounds] Lower the volume, damn it! Now make up some reason for your mom not to leave her room! Thank you so much. Tell your nephew I owe him a favor. Now I am wealthy and generous. What do you think? Beautiful house. They don't make houses like that anymore. No, the photoshopping! What do you think of the photoshopping? Does it look like a restoration? I would have loved to see it the way it used to be. The house was already sold. I mean the photo! Does it look like the old days or no? Yes. And the color? I chose it myself. Beautiful. It captures the... essence. [whimsical music] Green? Yes, do you like it? You painted the house green? Yes, it used to be green. How would you know? You weren't born yet! The photo, Mom. It's a black and white photo, dumb-ass. The Lima Preservation Society has experts who deciphered the color. Experts? They're useless. The facade wasn't green. It was sky-blue, wasn't it? It was light blue. That's why I have to go out there and oversee the work myself. I told you, it's dangerous! If you don't trust me, ask Gloria, the art historian, to supervise from now on. She has lived here for 50 years. Not like you, who left. I got married. Yes, with a social climber, who left you. She left me because everything was... ...poisoned. Didn't you sell her TV to buy coke? It was a shitty TV. Oh, but it backfired because she married a useless man! You know what? Gloria will take care of this mess. Wasn't it her idea? She didn't mean it. I don't care what that old lady says. Then why are you upset? Blue? Why did you say it was blue? Because it was blue. Who cares what color that dammed house was? I don't understand you, Tato. It seems like you mess up on purpose... ...to prove that you don't care what she says. But you don't believe it yourself. Why don't you stop this nonsense and start doing things right for once? [car door closes] [engine starts] [sniffs] [melancholic music] [melancholic music continues] [no audible dialogue] [melancholic music stops] Is it working? [Rosa] Wait, it's coming on. No, it's gone! And now? [Rosa] Wait, it is almost there. Here? [Rosa] Yes, that's it! [TV sounds] [melancholic piano music] [chuckle] Thanks, Eladio. [restoration's sounds] How late are they going to work? It's late, for fuck's sake, I can't hear the soap opera. - I'll tell them to stop. - Thank you! Mrs. Rosa says: it's late, for fuck's sake, she can't hear the soap opera. [restoration's sounds stop] Thanks for working late today, you can all go home. [Rosa] What the fuck? The light will come back on tonight, right? Yes, Gloria, no problem! Lower your voice! Nothing will happen, we gave her three Xanax. Inez, make sure she pees in the morning. [Inez] Yes, at 7 a.m., after her diabetes pills. Alright... Tato... Just so you know, I reminded your mother that the restoration was your idea. It doesn't matter, but thanks anyway. Bring me the cables. One second, it's a tangled mess. Tato... The truth is that in the beginning I thought you were useless. And an asshole. Thanks. But now that I see what you are doing for your mom... Wait a minute. [phone rings] Hello. What's up, man? Everyone is there? Alright, alright... I'm on my way. Yes, I'll be there soon. [Tato sighs] Damn, Inez... Is there a lot of work left? No, we are basically done. You are going to kill me but... ...I have an urgent matter with the real estate company. You think you can finish it by yourself? I guess so. Thanks. I feel bad, I wanted to stay but... ...time just flew by. Take this. And please don't tell Gloria I left. It's the thought that counts, and I don't want to mess up my image with Gloria. Please. Thanks for everything, I'll see you tomorrow. I left you some soda in the camper. [car alarms beeps] [engine starts] [upbeat dance music] [Tato] Yes, leaving Inez alone that night was not my most noble act... But how could I miss my penthouse housewarming party! Unmissable. An intimate celebration... Among friends that I'd just recently met. Italian design, made in Peru... the highest quality. [sniffs] [groans] Incredible, you don't even have to lean... You can remain upright, dignified. I prefer my ID card. [all laugh] Ladies and gentleman... Are we ready? [man] Yes! [all sniff, groan] [Tato] There are certain things in life... ...that unite us as Peruvians. Things that make us look beyond ourselves as individuals. So that we can see ourselves as a unit. A unit that fights for a common purpose. Some time ago... ...this humble servant... ...came across an opportunity. An opportunity to be a part of this beautiful housewarming time in our country's history. This unprecedented economic growth... ...which has brought Peruvians together as a family. And forget about silly nonsense like race and social class... [half-hearted applause] For these reasons, I am convinced... [man] Nothing has changed. Lima can change on the outside... But in the end, it's still the same old bullshit. [phone ringing] [man] Oh, who's Inez? [people exclaim] Inez, what's up? What happened? Nothing. Your mom is fine. She is fine, I didn't want to leave her alone. What are you doing? I offer my resignation. You are leaving now? Stop, you want more money? Look, I've thought it over and this job just isn't for me. Thanks. Wait, we can't do this without you, can't you see that? You cannot go, Inez. You cannot go. Let me go, you asshole, or I'll scream and tell your mom the truth. Traitor. And you? What are you? I don't know. You're immoral, a narcissist, a coke-head... And an asshole. What else? [car engine starts] Oh, and a mama's boy. [engine revs] [pensive music] [Rosa] Inez! Inez! I have to pee. If you're sleeping here, your room must be a disaster. Call Inez, I need to pee. Inez went to run an errand. How do you know, if you just woke up? Call Gloria. She's not here either, Mom. How do you know where everyone is? I just know that they're not here, it's not my fault. Stop yelling and help me, I need to pee right now. Help me. Right now? Give me 30 minutes and I will get a specialist. Specialist? Stop fucking around, I'm going to piss myself. Get the basin from under the bed. Specialist? Fuck, it's not here. What do you mean? Where is it? I don't know. [Rosa] Hurry up, it's coming out! Alright, wait! [suspenseful music] [Rosa] A paint bucket?! Just hurry up. Help me up. Watch out! Watch out! Put the bucket right under my... "thing." Where do you think I piss out of? This is a job for 2 people. Well, I know that, hold it, right there. Right there... [pee pattering] [groans] Finally. That's it, that's it. Careful. [grunts] OK, that's fine, let go. Thanks. I'm going to throw this away. Son. Thanks. For the restoration. [sighs] [soft atmospheric music] [Rosa] There are some rags over there. [music intensifies] [music stops abruptly] Inez? She went out. You'll be here for a while, right? I have to do something. Aren't you going to take me to see the restoration? [tense music] [indistinct chatter] [overlapping chatter, laughter] Tato! What a great surprise! What's up? We were just celebrating Galia's project. - Thank you. - Cheers. Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt. Well, yes I did. Aurelio, let me introduce the great Tato, the ex-owner of the house on Galicias Street. Wow. What an honor. I've heard a lot about you. Good things, I hope. A little bit of everything. Well... You are -- or I should say, were -- a key part of our project. And for that I thank you! [all laugh] That's just what I came to talk to Raymond about. Anything you want, brother. [Tato] I will say it right here since it involves all of us. I want to restore the house. I want to make it the way it used to be. With all of its ornaments. With all its details, its plants. Its original color. I already made the decision and it feels good. [intense piano music] I will give you all the money back. I don't know how but I promise that I will. [laughs] This guy's a genius. Tato, I am sorry. I would love to help. But it is too late. Too late? The demolition started a few minutes ago. I am sorry, Tato. [soft atmospheric music] [Rosa] Where is Tato? He told me he would take me to see the restoration but he is still not here. You take me, please. It's late. I don't think it is a good idea. Why not? Because it is dangerous out there. [Rosa] I don't understand you. Before you forced me to go out. Now I want to go out and you tell me "no". Everyone in this house is crazy. [sad strings music] [glass breaking] [sighs] [buzz] [siren wailing] [sad strings music continues] [panting] [thud] [car alarm beeps] [groaning] [panting] [Rosa groaning] [string music fades out] [wind blowing] [car door opens] [dramatic music] [dramatic music intensifies] [Tato] The bedroom idea didn't even last a week. But at least we were all still alive... and healthy... And I still had the penthouse and the unpaid money from the sale. My mother has signed all the contracts. So it's all settled then? She got a little mad, but... ...the sale is still legal. [grunts] Very well. [clears throat] So... ...when do you think I could get the rest of the money? You still owe me half. You're lucky Raymond isn't suing you. And still... ...you come here asking for money we owe you? [scoffs] Know your place. So you're not going to give me anything? Not even a little? Do you have a job? Look for a job. - Make something of yourself. - I'm looking. Look harder. There are lots of jobs out there. We don't owe you anything. Are we clear? [dramatic music] [indistinct dialogue] [Tato] In the midst of all this tragedy, I decided to leave my cherished new penthouse to my mom. Whose health had suddenly decayed. What are you standing there for, like a fool? There is nothing for me to fix, ma'am. Everything is new here. Alright Mom, I'm leaving. Do you need help, sir? No! Stay right there. Mrs. Rosa, you have a guest. [scoffs] Who's going to visit a dead woman? Dead and stupid. Eduardo... I'm sorry I came without calling. I heard the news and... I had to come. Yes... I went to Heaven... ...but it was full of social climbers, so I came back. [sad piano music] Six months later [Tato] Renouncing to my "nouveau riche" status was one of the hardest experiences of my life. Worse yet, was having to look for a job. Hurry up, we're falling behind. [phone ringing] Gloria, what's up? OK, OK. I'm on my way. - Mom, what happened? - Nothing's wrong. They told me I'm dying. They say I have two weeks. At this point, the sooner, the better. [scoffs] All I asked was to die in my room. But as you can see... Now I'm going to die in a building for "up-and-comers." [sarcastically] I am overwhelmed with happiness. For that I want to thank everyone... From the bottom of my heart. Gloria... Eladio... And especially you, my dear son. [dramatic music] [Rosa sighs] Come. [whispering] We have to take her home. What are you talking about over there? [upbeat pop music] Inez, the tamales saleswoman died. How sad? Well, since we can't record her, can you imitate her? You sound a bit like her. No! Please! If she's dead, tell Mrs. Rosa that. I think my mom would like to hear her one last time. You're right. Are you ready? Wait up, I have to rehearse... What do I say? I don't know. Do you remember, Eladio? Tamales! It needs more pepper. What do you know about making beef stew? It has to be just like the neighbor's, it has to smell bad. Hold on, what are you doing? Smells horrible. [upbeat pop music continues] [music fades out] I found the photos. Inez, you can go home, I can finish up. Don't you have something urgent tonight? Like a party? - No. - [phone ringing] Me neither. Tato, we have to go. [upbeat pop music resumes] Quick, quick! [tires screeching] Mom, let's go. Watch her head. [music ends] [door creaks, closes] [dramatic music] [intense strings music] [voice on recording] Tamales! Get your tamales! [inhales deeply] Mrs. Rosa, I have to fix a light. [intense strings music continues] It's time to take your medicine, Mrs. Rosa. Here's your sherry, Mrs. Rosa. [Tato sighs] I don't need money for coke, Mom. I need a new sweater, this one is old. [sighs] The divorce has been rough, Mom. I'm looking for a job, but... ...it's hard. [light chuckles] [both giggle] [tragic music] [Tato] My mom died at the age of 82. This time it was for real. No less real was the realization that this new era was not for me. But as a symbolic gesture in honor of my mother... The economy collapsed temporarily. All new construction projects were put on hold. One of them was the building they had started over my old house. [tragic music continues] But at that moment, at the end of this story... We found ourselves in a strange period of transition. A stillbirth... Where, seen at a distance... It was unclear to me whether these buildings were ruins or work-in-progress. It turns out that for that brief period... They were both. [upbeat pop music]
