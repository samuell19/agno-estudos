Before, way before we were born, this was all underwater It's true Everything beyond the highway was ocean Why? Why what? What made the ocean turn into fields? In Shuichi's wisdom, he generally ignored questions he couldn't answer Why would they turn the ocean into fields? I'm going Brother, brother, wait for me You were scared of being left behind As a child, you were timid, afraid to be left alone and a little spoiled Why do people die? Huh? That's just the way things are All living things die, that's how it is Once you learned to speak, you were forever asking "Why?" Why do people die? Shuji, it's time for your bath Mother smiles as she always did, dodging questions with a wry smile Keep thinking about that stuff and your head'll fall off You may not remember, but... Shuichi's answer finally seemed to satisfy you and you nodded gravely Your house was near what locals called "The Shore" And Shore people called the neighborhoods built on landfill "Offshore" Shuichi used to joke, "Hold your breath when you go 'Offshore"' My parents never scolded me for it About the time you first started school, a man and woman started living together According to gossip, his name was Kenji He was the demon, Kenji, so we called him Demonken The woman's name was Akane Supposedly worked as a hostess nearby What's up? What's up? Stop crying It's a wreck It'll just fall right off again You're from elsewhere? You from the Shore? Better push your bike home Yeah It's far Yeah Shut the fuck up! Hurry Want a ride home? Get in Hurry up, get in! What's your name? I'll throw you out Name's Shuji It's right on his bicycle You're a shrewd man where money's not concerned, Demonken That's right... That's Demonken, the gangster, murderer and sex fiend Idiots Idiots... Idiots. Idiots! That's right, they're all idiots God, it's hot! Don't, the kid's watching Let him learn Don't Don't... You can push your bike home from here, right? I'll take your bike down, you get out, too 10,000 yen, please Idiot Were you scared? A little But you didn't cry You look docile but who knows, maybe you're a gutsy kid Don't let on I gave you a ride You take care getting home I'll give you a ride anytime Next time, without her A few days later, Demonken's body was found in the woods He was buried in a hole, curled up in fetal position He had been shot fatally in the stomach, but his finger and toenails were torn off, and his right eye mashed with something like a nail Some said it wasn't his right eye, but his right testicle Idiots... Idiots... idiots Idiots, idiots... Your story began with the first tears you shed for another human They say this priest did time in prison for murder long ago Sort of reminds me of Demonken What reminds you? If you're an outsider, they always think you've done time Shu, do you think they'll have a Christmas party here? Don't you think they should, Shu? - Sure - Would you go? What if they make you drink chicken blood, yuck! Looks pretty normal Yeah, from the outside But actually, a murderer? It's only gossip and with gossip, you never know What's that mean? Father Miyahara Kazuo That's it, definitely, for sure The murderer's name was Miyahara And they say he was about 20, so the math checks out But you think a murderer would already be out of prison? Doesn't murder get the death penalty? Not necessarily. if he had a life sentence, he could be out on parole No death penalty for murdering 4 people? Sure, it happens You know, "mitigating circumstances" Recently, the trend's against execution And say he was 18 or 19 when he did it, he'd never have gotten Death In that case, we wouldn't know his name Honey, that's enough sake for you Even without publicity the neighbors would remember him Right... I'll look it up in old papers at the library If he wasn't a minor, there'll be a picture If there is a picture of the murderer, I'll show it to you so you can check A murderer, wow And if he is the murderer, then what? Nothing, nothing at all, but it's just too perfect Too perfect? It's Offshore Only at home... Thanks for the meal It was an amazing crime You won't believe it, wanna hear? I'll tell you, but stand at attention while you listen... This is important Miyahara was like a real demon it was over a breakup, but he stabbed 4 family members over 100 times He's totally insane Amazing, really... Amazing He's still at the church, right? I think so Next time you see him, why don't you ask him how it feels to stab someone? He stabbed 'em just like that Our parents had no idea what you were quietly putting up with Totally cool, totally cool Hey, man, thanks for saving our seats Who are you? What's this? Christmas service Two of you? Yeah Anyone else coming? No, just us Please, come in It'll start soon That girl's really cute Merry Christmas I've met you guys before Do they go to your school, Eri? They're Shore kids Does Shore mean over by the train station? Yes Offshore's on the landfill That's right, this whole area used to be underwater Do Shore and Offshore not get along? It's not that we don't get along Shore just looks down on Offshore Why is that? I don't know Why? Every person is of equal value I offer you a Bible Come and take it Come, now My stomach hurts, I'm going home What? Why are you running, Shu! Once you accept the Bible, you're stuck! We'd be trapped in that church for life, like Eri! Shit! And then you entered 7th grade Shu! Shu, we're in the same homeroom again You're breaking school rules I like my hair this way Schools rules don't dictate personal taste Personal taste is more important When you're at school, follow the rules I don't have to, education's compulsory Where's your respect for elders? Where's your respect! Enough! You have all day. Come see me when you're ready to cut your hair If you don't cut it, I'll cut it, right here, after school Got that? All right then, let's choose the class representatives For the first semester, I'll make recommendations Your older brother was Student Council President 2 years ago, gotta keep up Come, step up Let's have a vote of confidence Anyone opposed? Why? Reason! I don't like him He wins by majority vote About this morning, don't let it get to you Who cares She doesn't have a mom or a dad They both killed themselves The whole family did She's the only survivor When? When she was a kid She transferred here in 2nd grade, so before that, probably And I heard she's worn her hair that way ever since We have an agreement If you recognize your error and promise to cut your hair over the weekend, I'll let it go for today You have to follow school rules That's a student's duty! It's your fault you broke the rules I told you to cut your hair yourself Your aunt and uncle didn't know what to do They believed it was fine for the school to cut your hair They asked me to take care of it Teacher, please stop! Please! You sure don't take after your brother Students are obliged to follow the rules You break the rules, you lose your right to an education Your brother understood that perfectly That's all She was wearing sunglasses, but I swear it was her Maybe she came back to Demonken's house Her tits were about to fall out of her dress Shuichi had been in an excellent mood, ever since mid-term exams Pretty impressive, huh? Isn't it amazing? I knew I could do it You liked Shuichi and enjoyed watching our parents making a big fuss over him He's the top of his class I heard something interesting at our store What? They're building a resort hotel Offshore. Sports grounds and a park, too Those lucky Offshore guys, now they'll all be super rich A car's coming! Move over, it'll hit you! Hey Nanba! Look out! Watch out for cars, try not to go Offshore to play If a gangster car hits you, you're screwed And if it's your fault, then you're really screwed I'm sure deals were made, but it's good for the Offshore folks, no? Will everybody move? Of course But won't somebody want to stay? Only if they're holding out for a higher relocation fee Some of those Offshore folks are awful tricky Don't make a ruckus and interrupt your brother's studies Hello? Hello? Who is this? Hey! What? Why'd you keep running the other day when the car came? Just sort of... You were running behind me By chance And also, why did you ask the teacher to stop when I cut my hair? Dunno... Hey, want to come to church tomorrow? It's fun Yeah, but... Come, tomorrow The priest is going to explain the meaning of life I don't like listening alone Come with me I'll go tomorrow! I'll go tomorrow... What you just said, was that about Fate? Can you explain the difference between Karma and Fate? I think Karma's scarier than Fate What do you mean, scary? That there's nothing you can do about Karma And Fate? You can do something about it... Maybe All people die There is no one who won't That is human Karma But when we die, each of us dies differently How you lead your life, how and when you will die, this is Fate Fate is like an abacus game board The beads keep a record of many things Of fortune and misfortune According to Christianity, suicide is a sin, but I disagree A suicide victim just happens to land on the suicide bead It was just a roll of the dice Your father and mother landed on that bead But Eri, you didn't There are no more suicide beads before the game ends There's no turning back You will learn that today was the anniversary of Eri's family suicide I will protect you Several days later, you will learn something else... That Shuichi's abacus game didn't just have lucky beads Hey, Shuji Did you sleep with the window open? I forgot to close it, sorry Something got in No Something got in, in the night That's not true The anonymous phone call on Saturday, came from a student who had seen Shuichi cheating Suspended from school for a week, he broke down Oh, no, help me, Shuji Help me I can't do it alone Oh, no, oh, no... Shuichi, it's gone, gone Good night, brother Hey, bring more beer Come over here, kid Why do you have this? Is it from that depraved priest? I don't believe that story He killed 'em Brutally murdered a family of four I know, I can see it Him, all bloody, laughing, It's true, he laughed as he murdered a whole family Brother, have you read the Bible? Just bits of it How was it? Ridiculous, totally boring They're all idiots I... Like this part Is this about me? "The poor brother," is this about me? Brother, let's go to church together If we go at night, no one will see us Let's go together "And to all these qualities, add love, which binds all things together," "in perfect unity" Who's he? What's up? I brought my brother because he's interested in meeting the priest Why didn't you tell me there was a girl? Why didn't you tell me? Eri, what is all this? Is someone here? It's Shuji's brother I'm going home Won't you come in? No, right here is fine Why have you come here? I just wanted to see your face My face? I wanted to see how a killer looks See? I told you, it's true Just like I told you Shuji, you've been meeting a killer Letting a murderer read you the Bible How does it feel to murder someone? Tell me Say, mister, bet it felt good to kill someone You killed the woman first, right? The whole damned family How did it feel? Tell me I really want to know, really - Cut it out - It's OK. I'll tell you the story of my younger brother The story you want to hear, about the murderer My brother Yuji fell in love I welcomed her My brother and I were very close Sometimes she'd invite us both to her house for dinner I realized that her parents preferred me, as I was better educated But their daughter and my brother were in love She got pregnant I had violated her My brother found out His lover told him everything, about his terrible brother, told her parents, too My brother despised me As did his lover and her parents They showered hatred on me They should have killed me Kill yourself Kill yourself, you rapist I violated her That's true, but I didn't rape her I... I... I didn't force her Do you understand? Can you understand? The sin I committed is deeper still Your poor brother, robbed by his older brother My brother should have hated me He should have killed me But he couldn't do it He couldn't kill his brother One murdered son, the other a murderer, it would have destroyed our parents My brother thought everything through Burdened by sorrow and suffering with no respite, my brother suffered... He suffered terribly, terribly... Instead of killing me... he murdered her family Kill yourself! You should have killed yourself That's right Why didn't you do it? If you had, your brother wouldn't have killed That's right Then... You're the real murderer! Because I lived on, he killed four people and became a murderer Killer! Killer! Killer! Wait, brother I hope you'll come back No, I won't Now I've seen a killer's face Please come No Please read the Bible Forget that The Bible is filled with the Word The Word will save you Don't be late We waited a long time Is Tetsu taking the day off again? Something came up at the last minute Liar Eri and Shuji, you two go ahead But... I'll be fine, don't worry Got a minute? About relocating? Yeah, they're relentless Gangsters? I don't know... Hey, you, kid We've met before, right? She your girlfriend? It's been a long time Do you remember me? Yes You've grown, of course you have Already in junior high? Yes Time sure flies Did you know? There's going to be a big hotel here soon With a yacht harbor and a heliport Rich people will come to play there from all over the world But this church, you see... It just won't budge The landlord sold us the land, but the priest's holding out What an idiot Have you come back? Oh, no, no. I'm... A secretary Important, right? If you're ever in trouble, you come to me That Offshore shack, it's a vacant lot now Demonken san's house? Don't waste "San" on him Yeah, Demonken Brings back memories I figured you'd have forgotten him I remember Just remember the important things No luck? Well, slowly but surely Bye, hope to see you again Yes I'm thrilled you remember Demonken You know her? Yeah So, you're a traitor When I was a kid, just a little Tell that lady, not to force the church out Eri, don't be hard on Shuji But... It's not Shuji's fault You'll save the church? Don't worry Father, may I run? Yes She really loves to run Um... May I run, too? Please My Uncle says he'll settle That it's better than going to the police With the trucking company? Yes, it's a construction firm, but gangster-backed Yeah He said they'd gotten friendly That maybe they'll get big bucks for relocating I'm finally of some use to my aunt and uncle He says they're moving in March Has he already signed? Not yet, but soon Are you moving, too? I don't know Do you know where they're moving to? Is this an interview? Tokyo Tokyo Am I too heavy? You're fine Shall I get off? No, just hold on That fire was arson, right? The gangsters They're gangsters, they'll do anything Think they'll do it again? I do Me, too They'll keep at it until all the Offshore houses are gone But the Shore people are happy, right? One hundred years ago, this was all ocean It's unnatural to fill in the ocean What are you doing, Shuji? Went to watch the fire There was a fire Offshore Lady, don't give up Everything burned down This is the third house Goddam them! Will you help me? What's wrong? You seem down Well... Did Tetsu come back to school? I see He came to the church last night He comes every night Tetsu doesn't want to be at home or at the store Yes He says no one at school speaks to him Including you? He cried and swore he didn't start any fires Yes I believe Tetsu Eri came to church alone, too She keeps insisting she doesn't want to go to Tokyo Shall we go inside? Or is it easier to talk out here? The fires... It might have been my brother Shuichi Where are you going? To the store? I'd like to go, too Let's go together Wait Don't, Shuichi Stay away, go inside Are you really going to the store? Go inside Is there anything I can do? If there is, ask me. Anything There's nothing Get inside or you'll catch cold You Red Dog! The family that produced the Red Dog is equally responsible Listen up! Talk to a Red Dog relative then you're a Red Dog, too Never, ever talk to Shuji! We're the victims here! It was "Red Dog" who had set the fires A dog who raced past houses and down back alleys, in the night Shuichi had become a Red Dog I'll always remember the 13 years I lived here Aren't you going to say anything, Nanba San? I hate all you guys He should've burned down all your houses Why don't you ask Shuji's brother All right then, that's that... I'm not done yet! You guys think blaming one Red Dog solves things? There's more than one Red Dog A house on fire is a beautiful sight Not that you'd know There's lots of Red Dogs Even if you catch one, there'll always be more You'll all become Red Dogs Every last one of you Thinks you'll be a Red Dog Some joke I hope that Shore and Offshore will all burn down Then, I'll say, "I'll told you so" Good bye, everyone That's all Call me! Write me! Please! Write me or call me when you get there! Tell me where you are! Hey, we'll take your pants off Bring Nanba Eri here Take away her crutch and she's toast Somebody kill him!

"Die!" I'm home Landfill Collapses Resort Plans Cancelled A day trip to Osaka? I'm going to visit my brother I want you to meet my brother before they set his execution date My brother wants to meet you I'm sorry I wrote about you in some of my letters You may not want to meet him, but I hope you will I got a letter from Eri She sent something along with it It's the story of a girl called Eri I'm sure she wants you to read it "Once upon a time, a weak couple lived in a weak city "filled with weak inhabitants "Though they knew themselves to be weak, the couple "had the gall to become parents "And had a baby girl "The baby girl often cried at night "Whenever she cried, her father screamed "Screaming at a crying child only makes the crying worse "Her father was so stupid, he couldn't even make this simple connection "Soon Eri's father resorted to violence "Her mother simply cowered in fear "But the girl didn't hate her father the most "She hated her mother "She had no escape from her mother's embrace "When her mother held her to her cowering breast, "the girl was forced to absorb her mother's tears, "her screams, her resignation, and even "the dull thud of her husband's kicks "The mother called out the girl's name over and over like a chant "Eri, Eri, Eri... "Calling her name, she held the girl... "Morning, noon, "and night, always... "The mother always fastened her daughter's long hair in a ponytail "She always insisted the ponytail was very becoming "But sometimes, Eri's mother would yank that ponytail "Not for any reason, just yank "As if to say, 'You'll never get away from me"' "Then one day, the weak parents died "Eri's father bought sleeping pills "so they wouldn't disturb their sleeping child, "as they quietly took their own lives "However, both parents "were so weak, they couldn't even "stick with that plan "Eri, Eri, wake up" "Eri wakened to her name "She ran away "Her mother did not pursue her "Perhaps because she'd left her daughter's hair unbound as she slept "The girl ran through the night streets until she was out of breath "She raced on, barefoot "Then, she stumbled and fell to the ground and looking back... "Saw the apartment in flames" I've brought Shuji to see you Don't you have anything to ask him? Why didn't you die? You tried to kill yourself, right? I can tell, just looking at you But you didn't die Why not? Were you scared to die? You're me You're me We're the same Stop it We're the same I couldn't do it, either I just couldn't I had enough despair to kill myself, but I couldn't see it through Only the despair remained Burdened with that despair, I aimed it at others I cut off my future if I had died, they'd be alive I'll be killed soon That's my punishment I'm empty and I'll die empty Eventually, you'll be this way I can tell I'm you, you're me We're... Time's up The same Shuji, I'm sorry It wasn't supposed to be like this I'm sorry You didn't hear anything Please forget... Forget everything stupid I'm sorry, it's all my fault... Sorry I'm late What's wrong? Are you crying? How about we go and get some dinner What're you up for? I'll treat you to your favorite meal Let's have sex This is your first time? What can I say? For your first time, let's go somewhere pretty You sure you don't mind? I told you, yes I don't have a condom Don't need it But... Nitta wants me to make a baby Nitta's my husband He's in love with me so he's desperate for me to get pregnant It'll be more fun without a rubber Your first drink This is your second "first" with me So, what are you going to do? Live in Osaka? I'll try going to Tokyo Got anyone there? No It's easier to talk when you're drunk, right? Life's like that Shu, this is Nitta San He always looks after me Say hello You get him drunk? Just a little And see, since Shu came all the way here to see me, I thought we could put him up at a hotel The Minami Hotel, they've got suites Call and book one Hey, honey, a single's fine He's alone Hey, bet you can't walk by yourself You can lean on me We'll go to the john, then catch a ride No, no, I'll take him He's a relative I'll settle up, wait in the car No, that's not... OK, time to use the john Hold on to me How is it? Can't throw up? Don't hold it back You'll feel much better after Come on, try throwing up That's it, that's right I don't like your attitude You've got a look that I don't like You'll feel better Drink this Drink it all up It's hell Being with him, it's just hell Don't think about anything If you do, your head will fall off Empty your head, and make yourself into a doll Why? So you prefer this? Drink! Drink! You! Miyuki, how old are you?

You're still warm You're still warm... but you're dead... now... I had to let Shu get away You don't mind? You treated him terribly And Miyuki too When we're reincarnated... Let's give up the gangster life Give it all up And if fate let's us... Meet again Maybe we should split up to leave You go first and I'll follow a little later Otherwise, it'll be really bad Don't worry I want to go home, too I want to see my Mom Wait at the station for half an hour If I'm still not there, take off by yourself Hey, they hung up! Fucking idiot! Yes? Hello Hello Eri? Can you tell? It's me Can you tell, it's me? Where are you? Tokyo Why? I just arrived in Tokyo, now I said... why? I don't know How long will you stay? Forever Have you run away from home? Yeah I think you should go back Don't you think your parents are worried about you? Dad's gone He disappeared, after you left Really?

Don't stare at me so hard I'm not You've grown, Shuji Not really... you look the same That bad? Not at all Your leg hurt? Not that much, but I can't walk on it... Ever I'm tired, let's rest Hotel More Is this your first time in a place like this? What's wrong? Don't you feel well? Hey, hey Shuji, hey, are you OK? Hey, what's wrong? I... no... What? What did you say? I can't hear Shuji... I... kill... Say, Shuji Did you mean "I killed," or that you want to kill No Amazing You killed someone You can have this Whenever you're ready, whenever the mood strikes you, kill me I'd rather be killed than kill myself Did you read my letter? Yeah I thought so I knew the priest would show it to you I'm sorry "The Weak Couple" is a good story, no? Did it move you? Eri There's more to the story The next part is about a strong, lonely girl, and a weak, devious boy... "Once upon a time, "there was a strong and lonely girl, "whose weak parents committed suicide "Her aunt and uncle looked after her "The story starts one Sunday, about a year ago..." How are you feeling? How's... your fever? Aren't you cold? Are you asleep? Can't you get up? "Happy ending..." Guess that'd be a bit much Cut it out "The surviving daughter lived happily ever after..." Wouldn't work either... Cut it out Everything I told you was true You were precious to me Shuji, you want to be connected to someone Yeah What for? They'll just betray you Don't you get my stories? But you were always precious Sorry A little rest This is my favorite spot I like to space out here, alone This is where I'd live if I was homeless "Please, someone kill me" "Please, someone, live with me" Eri! What brings you here? Have you come to see your uncle? Sweet Let's get something to eat What would you like? Or shall I take you somewhere else? What's wrong? I guess we've come half way Say, Shuji, do you think my uncle made it? I don't know Do you think he deserves to die? I don't care I'm sorry What'll we do when we get back? Is there anywhere you'd like to go? The landfill Can't you run even a little? I doubt it Want to? In my next life, I'll run That's a long way off, then Maybe you can still run Give me those You can run, Eri You're crazy Hold on tight Stop, it's dangerous Hold on tighter Everybody's staring Here goes, don't let go Shuji, as you raced down the streets of Tokyo, a decomposed body was found in the mountains outside suburban Osaka The next morning, the body was identified The girl who ran away from Tokyo, had returned to the earth, without telling her story to a single soul but you Shuji, on a beautiful morning at the end of spring, I left the town with the vast landfill and returned to my hometown I buried my brother's ashes, which I had kept with me, in my parents' grave I, the cursed one, stood in front of a Buddhist grave, and read a passage from the Bible for my brother "One generation passes away, "and another generation comes: But the earth abides forever" Later I found out you were reading the same passage, in the streaming sunlight on a train When I heard that, Shuji I wept for you Murderer/Red Dog/Die I'll wait outside Sorry Shuji Guess your uncle... made it You're my hostage Don't say anything or do anything It's hopeless anyway We can't get away Someday... you'll run Someday... let's run together My, my boyfriend dumped me last night I was depressed and spaced out, when I saw your message on the shutter I'm not sure what it means, but it's been on my mind Hello? Are you listening? Hello? Your story is finished What follows is no longer yours, but just a little summer scene I wish to share with you The sunflowers bloomed again They faced the morning sun, standing on tiptoe I offered one at your grave I left it there for you yesterday, with the only family to survive you Nozomi What day is tomorrow, Nozomi? The day Mommy comes home Tomorrow afternoon, this home, which was once a church, will be lively The boy's mother will come home, having paid for her crime And Shuji, the very last thing Don't you hear them, Shuji? Those footsteps coming up the gently-sloping path to our home Footsteps following Nozomi, who loves to race, all the way around the house, they lag far behind him, yet finally approach the finish line Don't you hear them, too, Shuji?
