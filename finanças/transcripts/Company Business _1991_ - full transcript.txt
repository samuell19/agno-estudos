Steve, this is Roy. There's something funny going on in "E" section. Let's check it out. I'm in room 168. Nothing here. Room 159. Nothing doing. He's right between you. Room 160, negative. Damn. Come on, now. Talk to me, people. You guys found anything yet? Hang on, Roy. 161, nobody here. I'm in room 162. Je-sus. We have a break-in. Break-in confirmed. Condition red. Secure the building. Secure the building. All "D" Sections are sealed. "G" Sections sealed. Coming up stairway alpha. Main gate closed. We had him. Turn on that there fence! Damn! Maxine Grey. Good morning. Uh, right. Yes. I could take a message. OK. Thank you very much. Maxine Grey. Good morning. Uh, yes. Hello. OK. Well, give me your number. Right. I'll give him the message. Thanks for calling. Bye-bye. Maxine Grey. Good morning. NO, I'm sorry. They're all in a conference. May I take a message? Sorry. Oh. OK. Thank you. Bye-bye. What you got there? Computer printouts. How did you get it? I random-accessed their computer with a digital sequencer... and force-fed adjusting parameters... until it just punched them out. Gave them a virus for good measure. That's good. I love telephones. OK. I'll tell him. They're nearly ready for you now. Five minutes. Thank you. I sprained my ankle this morning. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Man, I'd just kill for a cup of coffee. I don't suppose you could run down the hallway... and get me a cup of coffee, could ya? - Sure. No problem. - Yeah? Yeah. How do you take it? Black's fine. Black? Yeah. I'll hold that for you. Good morning. - Be right back. - OK. I don't have any further information for you. Maxine Grey. Good morning. Uh, yes. Hello. That meeting is tomorrow. I beg your pardon. We, uh, random-accessed their computer... with a digital sequencer... then force-fed adjustable parabolics... until it just, uh, punched them out. Then, of course, I... slipped their computer a virus. What the hell. Here's what they got. They've got your moisturizer... your foundation cream, and your lip gloss. No question about it, folks... they're ripping you off. Maxine Grey owes you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Boyd. Well, um... I can't wait to collect. Here. Hello? Who do you like in the fifth? I think you have the wrong number. You know where he is? All right. I'll tell him. Crank. For me? Some guy says, "Who do you like in the fifth?" Oh, shit. What? Hey, uh, I got to go. Are you serious? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Washington, D.C... Dulles International Airport. We have to make a stop at International. You're holding tickets. Chicago to Berlin. John Jones and Avram Levi. Why me? Why take the Battleship Missouri out of mothballs? Welcome to Virginia, Sam. Elliot. The company has missed you. Good flight? I could use some coffee. Help yourself. You know my guys Dick Maxfield, Bruce Wilson. And this is a very special friend to the company... Mr. Paco Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez is in... Colombian pharmaceuticals. I would very much like to help your country. So, is this a retirement party? We're all riding off into the sunset, are we? Governments come and go. Bureaucracies remain the same. Just look at us. Now... We've been approached by Colonel Grigori Golitsen... with a proposition that we find interesting. The KGB's making propositions to you? We do a lot of business with the KGB these days. They're cutting deals. You remember Ernest Sobel? Ernest Simpson Sobel... U-2 pilot shot down over Tashkent, 1969... convicted of espionage... life imprisonment. For two million, we can have him. Don't tell me they're that broke. Well, we'll throw in one of theirs. That way it'll look like a swap. That's not illegal. Looks better for Grigori, too. If this works, it could be a whole new program for us. Why don't you just wait a couple months... and Gorbachev will send them all back... for National Brotherhood week? Gorbachev may not be around that long... and then we'll have lost the chance. The President loves this guy. You get him back... He'll give us the medal of honor. We don't want the medal of honor! What we would like... is to get Congress off the Company's back... SO it can resume full effectiveness... in defending this nation from its enemies. Thank you, Colonel Grissom. See, Sam, they're, uh... they're pissed because we didn't tell them... about the wall coming down... and then we goofed on the Noriega thing. Who do you want to swap? Know this guy? Pyiotr Ivanovich Grushenko. You do know him. Well, it just says his name right there. Very effective mole. Penetrated the State Department... Southeast Asian Division... all the way up to level three clearance. Arrested in 1984. Nobody gives a shit about this guy. Come on, Sam. This is not arms for hostages. This is perfectly straightforward. If it's so straightforward... what are we doing here in the bubble room... with Senor Gonzalez? I would very much like to help your country. Mr. Gonzalez' associates have very kindly offered... to put up the $2 million necessary for this operation. NO way we can ask the taxpayers... to help us out on this one, Sam. The bills are numbered just in case... Please. It hurts my professional pride, OK? Sam. May I call you Sam? Yeah. The point is, this is not exactly kosher. But here's a chance to get back a major player... with a minimum of fanfare. Define minimum. You. No backup? Perfectly straightforward. You pick up Grushenko... get him to Berlin by the Fourth... bring home Sobel. "John Jones." What's the difference? John Jones, man from Mars. "Avram Levi." I'm Israeli? It's just a precaution. Well, I'm no poli-sci major. By the way, I never signed for the money. What money? What about expenses? Here's a voucher. Take it to the cashier on the first floor. Try to keep accurate records. They're all over us about that sort of thing now. Restaurants, travel... Movies, cookies. Where will the swap take place? We'll let you know. OK. God, I hate those old guys. We can't use anyone on the current roster, Pierce. I hate it when I see those wheels going around. And the North Dakota sugar beet crop... is said to have been the best in ten years. Farmers credited the recent rains... for ensuring the bumper harvest. In Texas, there's still no clue... to explain the mysterious disappearance... of Texas ARM Professor Norbert Kelly... whose abandoned car was found by police yesterday. Theories that Kelly may have left the state... have brought in FBI investigators... in a widening search effort. Coming up next, the weather. Hey, check it out, man. Hey. Boy, you never touch me like that! Hey, scumbag, where are you going? Hey, get back here! Your mama! Yo, yo, guard, man... bring that Russkie back here! He's mine! You ain't asked nobody if you could take him. Peter Ivanovich Grushenko? Pyiotr Ivanovich. Yeah. What's happening? Do you like baseball? I know baseball. You know baseball? Well... Peter... I got news for you. That's your new uniform. You're being traded. Let's go. Second boarding call... for Air France flight 618 departing from gate 34... from Chicago to Berlin Tegel. Can you get me a newspaper? We got to catch that Air France flight. What do you want? "Washington Post". You stay right there, OK? Yeah, yeah. Second boarding call... for Air France flight 618 departing from gate 34... from Chicago to Berlin Tegel. Shit. Excuse me. Pardon me. Hey, what's wrong with you, man? Pardon me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Final boarding call... for Air France flight 618 departing from gate 34... Shit. You son of a bitch. You shit, you. Hey! I told you not to pull this crap, didn't 1? Had a good run? What are you playing, hide-and-go seek with me? What the hell do you want me to do? You pick me up in the middle of the night. I'm not even allowed to call my embassy. Trade? Some bullshit. Food's pretty good. Stoli. Hey. I bet you thought about Stoli... more than once in the last seven years, haven't you? Hey, look, stupid, if I had orders to kill you... why didn't I do it last night... when we were out in the middle of nowhere? Hey, I don't know your orders. I only know that... for a real trade... I have my lawyer, I sign papers... I get a military escort... not some bullshit in the middle of the night. ESCORT? Who are you, Princess bi? Besides, Russians would never trade for me. I'm not worth it. If you're not worth trading for... why would they bother to kill you? Maybe Russia think I talked. Ever try Starka? Starka. It can't be as good as Stoli. It's not. I just prefer it. Starkle, huh? Starka. Thanks. I can understand why you're nervous... about what Moscow might be thinking. This whole deal, you know, is weird. I got to admit that. SO you don't know what you're doing, either. Hey, tovarishch, I'm just like you... except you're going home. What makes you think that I'm so crazy to go home? At least in prison I knew the rules. Mesdames et messieurs... bienvenue a Berlin. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Berlin... where the local time is 6:30. I keep a gun in Berlin. Clean yourself up. You look like hell. I'm glad somebody cares. Why Berlin? Are you kidding? We always go to Berlin. I still can't believe it. No more wall. They're gonna set it up around London Bridge... in Lake Havasu. Want to buy a piece? Can't you buy me a coat instead? I'm freezing. I got a better idea. What's the name of that stuff? Tell me which one is the snorka. You mean Starka? That's easy. Some kind of fruit vodka. Is that Starka? Don't like it? Give us a bottle of Starka. Mr. Boyd. What's happening here? The food is wonderful here. That borscht was really good. Speak English? Hey, you're almost home. Stop this crap. Home, home. Who the hell do you think I am, E.T.? That's funny. I don't belong here. I don't belong there. You tell me where's home. Search me. Couldn't you just let me go? Oh... You could come with me. Why would I want to do that? Admit it, your life sucks. Hey, leave my life out of this. You're used up like me. Come on. Why would I want to go anywhere with you? Why not? We're not bad guys anymore. The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming, huh? The Japanese are here. They own your whole fucking country. What's that mean... I'm supposed to go off and elope with you? Hey, you and me, we're... we're servants for a few assholes. Same bullshit. Hey, don't go all Russian on me now, OK? Whose ass you Americans going to kick now, huh? We always got Fidel. We always got him, too. True. How you doing? How do you think I am doing? Don't take this personally, all right? What would you do if the situation was reversed? Look, don't take this personally... but it's a dumb question. It's just that I keep thinking... it could be nice... a country without bullshit. One could invent a country. As long as they serve Storka. Mr. Boyd? Yeah. Hey, Sam. I thought they retired you after Nicaragua. Mike. You're a long ways from Central America. I'll take that. Does this have to be such a big production? No more wall. We got to improvise. We got the place closed for maintenance. Maintenance, huh? You know there are parts of the world, Sam... where people would call what you got in that bag... a lot of money. Now, listen up. One double car, one driver, and you. That's all each side is allowed. I can follow you on this thing... and you can talk to me on the phone till you get there. Klaus. Here is the old border. AS you can see... the train goes under where the wall used to be... and inside East Berlin for two stops. And it shows up in West Berlin again... here at Deutsche Oper. You'll go past the first station... Jannowitzbrucke. KGB will be patrolling. Is that legal? Well, you can call it confederated... united, amalgamated. There's 200,000 jumpy Russians... still stationed in East Germany. Then you'll come to Alexanderplatz. They come in on their branch line, lower level. You follow the stairs to the old terminal. The wall went up before they could finish it. There's a chain link fence with a gate. Here's a key. Only he goes through the fence, or the shit hits the fan. Copy? Yeah. How will they know we're there? Turn on the lights. Game time. Creep. You speak English? Ich verstehe kein wort... aber ich weiss was ich zu tun habe. Wenn sie, uh, wie heisst das wort? Uh... uh... Slowly. Mike, we're here. Take off. Right. We're coming up to Jannowitzbrucke. Looks like "Alien". We're here. So are they. Hold this. Wow, look at this. Two million bucks. It's not exactly an even trade. I've got it, huh? YOU mean I'm just a courier, yes? Something like that. Interesting. Very interesting. What are you complaining about? You're going to be a millionaire... for a couple of minutes. Thank you very much. Watch it. These steps are rotten. Sam... thanks for the drinks. It was nice. Say hello to Red Square for me. Yeah, I will. Drink Storka. Starka. What the hell? Grushenko, hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Let's go. Come on. Stop! Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go! Back in the train! Back it up! Go! Go on! YOU cover me. I'll try to get this thing started. Come on. Come on. Mike, abort! Abort! What? No! Back! NO way. Back! Goddamn, you son of a bitch! Thanks for waiting. Where in the hell did you go? What happened down there? I liked you better than I liked him. Mayday. Mayday. They're heading towards... Deutsche Oper. Now, I want that station cordoned off, now. You don't want to stop here? No. They'll be expecting that. By the way, I want my gun back. OK. Patch me through to Washington. See what the boys in the back room will have. And tell them I'm having the same. Go see what the boys in the back room will have. And give them the poison they need. And when I die. Don't spend my money. On flowers and my picture in a frame. Just see what the boys in the back room will have. And tell them I sighed. Wer ist dein freund? She said she likes you. Just act natural, OK? What? I'll have the same. Get us a couple of drinks and don't try anything funny. You're kidding. Hey, you know what I'm talking about. Listen, if I was trying to do anything... why did I give back the pistol? Could I have an outside line, please? Yeah, why did you? Stupid of me. Hey, that's right. Number thirteen in the back. Hey, I've got my eyes on you. Excuse me. Wo ilst die toilette? Da um die ecke dort. Danke. You screwed up! NO. They screwed up. What are you talking about? You opened fire in East Berlin! Two guys are shot! What are you trying to do, restart the cold war? Elliot, will you just hold your dick? Listen to me. Will you just listen? It wasn't him. On, for Christ's sakes, talk English. You sound drunk. It wasn't him. It wasn't Sobel. It was a guy I saw at Dulles Airport... day before yesterday. What? I'm trying to tell ya, they're running a scam on you. This guy didn't just come out of prison. He was waiting in line at Aeroflot for tickets. He had dark hair and a mustache. See, I saw his picture... in the "Fort Worth Times" where he had a beard. The paper said he was a professor or something... and that he was missing. Where are you? Uh, we're at a gas station on the autobahn. Berlin... Berlin. Sam... What? Sam, you've got to be straight with us... or we can't help you out. Yeah, I was just checking... to see if your stuff was all working. We're still in Berlin. Yeah, right. Now, we've got a safe house in West Berlin. I assume we're talking about west Berlin. Yeah. West Berlin. Wahringstrasse, number 32. Wahringstrasse. So, you hang loose for one hour... and then we'll bring you in. 32 Wahringstrasse. Shit. Shit! Elliot, you didn't ask him about the money. Forget the money. Gonzalez ain't gonna open his yap. You better get on the zee phone, Elliot. Yeah. What's happening? They're bringing us in... 32 Wahringstrasse in an hour. And tell them I sighed. And tell them I cried. What's this? Trabant... East German. Is it alarmed? Only if you frighten it. Hey, did you ever notice... the only thing you ever hear about the Swiss Army... is their knives? The only thing you hear about Trabant... is they're plastic. Do you believe what they have told you? I saved them from messing up. I saved them a lot of money, too, so I'm a hero. You know what Dr. Johnson said? Who? He said that patriotism... is the last refuge of a scoundrel. He said what? That it wasn't Sobel. Of course it was Sobel. It was Sobel. There's no question who it was. I told you not to use these old guys. Pierce, you weren't there. He says no. It was some guy he saw... at the Aeroflot counter at Dulles... only with dark hair. Some missing professor. Oh, no. What do you mean? Pierce? Elliot, I'm only gonna say this to you once. If that old man sells his life story... to "Time" magazine... you and I go right into the shithole. I want you to put the toothpaste back in the tube. But, Pierce, the guy just saved us from... Elliot, it is no longer fashionable... to ransom hostages with Colombian drug money. Do you read me? Yes. Then do it. Sam. What? Pull over for a second. Just pull over. Listen, I think it's stupid of us... to trust your safe house. I think it stinks. Come on. Let's just go. You want to go, go. Go. Go. I thought we were friends. My friends aren't stupid. I'll just take the money. What are you going to do? That's my business. Son of a bitch! What kept you? Couldn't find a parking place. Shall I ring the bell? No, wait a minute. Don't want to wake up the neighborhood. What do you know about this? Nothing. I just know Halloween when I see it. Don't you think you're being a little theatrical? Someone's got to take care of you. Ooh! Elliot... that little creep bastard. This way. I thought you were leaving. Meantime, we're even, OK? I didn't realize Russians were so sentimental. Yeah. We are. Can you go higher up? Is there someone else to bring us in? Hey, you don't get it, do you, tovarishch? There's no place to bring us in to. If 1 go back, assuming I get there alive... I'm the next Oliver North without a chestful of medals... with an Israeli passport, yet. We've still got the money. The money is all numbered. It would be like signing our names. We've got to ditch the car. What do you think they'll do when they find out? Close up Berlin. Send it here. The CIA, Langley, Virginia. Oh, yeah, they, uh... they showed up, all right. Blew up the bloody house and left. We're working on it. Vier neun drei und dreissig auf der autobahn. How long is this gonna take? This is the new, improved, big Berlin. These people don't jump for us like they used to. It's gonna cost. Yeah, yeah. Haben sie diese manner gesehen? Der verkehr ist umgeleitet. Hier ist spandau. Avram Levi und John Jones. What are we telling the German cops? Either it's Ahmed Jabril, the Pan Am bomber... or an Iraqi hit squad. What time is it over there? Almost two A. M. We'll need some passports. Know what? I think I know the guy. Where did you get that thing? It was in Trabant. We're on the corner... of Zietenstrasse and ziembernstrasse. Oh, I know who you mean. - Horst. - Horst. Yeah. He's this way. Are you coming? What do you think? Yeah, I'm coming. How long will it take them to come up with Horst? Who knows? - You ever played roulette? - No. You're playing it now. OK? Yeah, OK. Who do you want to be? It doesn't matter. As long as it's common market. Oh, wait a minute. I wonder if I should shave off my mustache. What do you think? They're probably expecting that. Forget that mustache. That's history by now. Make you a Belgian. Need credit cards, too. American express. No. Visa, Mastercard. And I want a rundown... of anyone that Boyd ever used in Berlin. He's gonna be calling in favors. Hey, Elliot, you think this could be the guy? Well, let's see. Horst Von Hoven. Documents for... Oh, not Horst. Christ, is that old nazi still on our payroll? We got him back from the Russians in '86. You sign your Belgian name, huh? Uh, I think I'll keep my own fingerprints here... Horsty, OK, huh? I develop the extra passport photos... in case you change passports again. You wait. Zwei minuten. Standby. Come on, you damn nazi. Answer the phone. Is that the correct address? Get the lamp. Hold it. Horst, Horst... Aw, fudge. I didn't have the heart to tell you... but he started working for us again... after you went up the river. Aufmachen! Polizei! Give me the keys. Where's the key? You got the keys. You got the keys. Come on. Come on. Allee durchsuchen. Yeah, yeah. Take them to the lab. Give me a sealer. - Herr Flinn? - Yeah... Herr Flinn. - Jesus. - Jesus. Get me on the next flight to Berlin. This whole thing's getting out of hand. They're mugging everybody in Europe. Elliot, what do we tell the old man? You don't tell him a thing. This is a company problem! Was it good for you? What's going on? We're up to our armpits in toothpaste. We're off to Berlin this afternoon. Asshole. He never should have used that old man. How are we gonna play it? I feel bad for Elliot. Someone's got to hang out to dry. Bruce, one more thing... I want the Sobel trade back on. It's more trouble than it's worth, isn't it? I know what it's worth. Sam, Sam, look at this. Guten morgen. Come on. Come on. Hey, it's been seven years. Come on. The way I figure it... they could box us in here for 24 hours. After that, it just gets too expensive. She's pretty, en? Come on. Yeah. The fruits of democracy. Look at this fruit. Hey, hey, hey, come on. Fruit is the first place they're gonna look. I know. Just looking. Wow! Hey, they can't keep us penned up here forever. It's a totally illegal operation. It's all funded by Colombian drug money. Bikes? Who do I know in Berlin? Faisal Tewfik, the Saudi arms dealer? He owes me a favor. This guy is rich. He keeps a cigar humidor right next to him. It's got a million bucks in it. Wait till you see this place. He's got toilet seats that are 14-karat gold... more beautiful women... than you've ever seen outside of Las vegas. The guy's so rich, he could ski uphill. Pretty quiet. Yeah. I hope he's not off on his yacht some place. Just how big of a favor does he owe you? Pretty big. I bought some stingers off him for the Contras. Boneheads couldn't make them work. Turned out they were defective. No hard feelings, though. Sam Boyd to see Faisal. Ah, yeah. Hello, Faisal. Sam Boyd? I do not believe. Long time no nothing. Come in, come in, Sam Boyd. Uh, excuse the mess. I am... redecorating. This is a friend of mine... John Jones. Your servant, Mr. Jones. You are welcome to my house. Mint tea all around? Could we just drop the Arabic amenities and get right down to the case? I have two million dollars here. Did I hear you correctly? Two million? My friend, you could not have come... at a more opportune time. It looks like you're about a billion short here. Actually, all we really need is a room for the night. My house is yours. But I think I can help with laundering the money. Look, we form a limited partnership. I've got all the papers here. It is so simple. First we exchange your dollars for Brazilian cruzeiros. They are impossible to trace. With the Brazilian cruzeiros, we ship out rocket launchers... to the Contras. The Contras have disbanded. Right. Right. All right. How about we trade your dollars... for German deutsche marks? The rates are excellent this week. We form a Panamanian corporation... and sell mortars to the Cubans in Angola. The Cubans are out of Angola. The Russians are out of Afghanistan. You're gonna love this: We trade for Escudos... and sell exocet missiles to Lithuania, huh? Oh, who am I kidding? They are stone broke. Ah! The P. L.O. Don't tell me. They recognized Israel. Goddamn it! Nowadays, you can't give away anything... to the Colombian drug cartel. Sam, you got to help me, please! Faisal, all we need is a bed. I just need to prime the pump. I think I should send telex to my ex-wife... I've finally found an apartment with a fireplace. We've got to change that money... maybe go to Switzerland, if we can get there. I want to go some place warm. Wonder who got the gold toilet seats. You know, I think I know a girl in Paris... who could help us clean the money. You haven't been to Paris in seven years. How do you know where she lives? The nightclub had more than one phone, Sam. You little devil, you. You want to see something? What? Look at this. What time is it? Seven A. M. I think we're surrounded. Hello, Faisal. I haven't seen you since Nicaragua. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. No point in saying good-bye to Faisal. What he doesn't know can't hurt us. Are you serious? Yeah. I see your phone's been disconnected. Have you been doing any entertaining lately? It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. Hey, Sam, there is something I've got to tell you. That guy in the subway? Yeah, what about him? He was my control. Come again, now. In the states, six years, he ran me. Wait a minute. Whoa, Nelly, here. You're losing me. You mean the guy in the subway was really Sobel? Yes, sir. Jesus Christ. Sobel. Look, you're America. I'm Russia. This is Sobel. 1969, Sobel flies a U-2 over Russia... where he gets shot down... - SO they turn him. - They put a beard on him... and send him back to the States to make a network. So he's in the States. Why doesn't he blow the whistle? Why does he stay commie? He is not a commie. He's a yuppie. They paid him, probably very well. Then, when I got arrested, he went underground. I never knew where. I think I know where. I think he was an economics professor... at Texas AM. I saw it in a Fort Worth paper. He's supposed to have been kidnapped. Well, then the guys in Moscow got this brainstorm... how they could recycle him, bring him back to Russia... and send him home as Sobel... to start all over. You know, it almost happened. Son of a bitch. I saw him at the Aeroflot counter. He was standing in line, rolling his head like this. He was on his way to Russia. He was gonna go back, then turn around... come back to the United States as Sobel... a big hero. There was someone running Sobel. I never knew who, just his code name... Donald. Did you ever meet Donald? I had to memorize his phone number. Never used it. Sobel used to joke... that Donald had what you call a sweet tooth. Why are you telling me this now? I don't know, but it feels great. Whoever told Elliot to have me wasted... because I screwed up the trade... knew that Sobel was a double agent... and liked it like that. Going in the right direction. Hey, take this, will you? Oh, man. I'm getting too old for this. Sit down, please. Now, what I would like... is a hot, black coffee... and something to eat. Ein schwartzen kaffee und ein sandwich... fur den herren, bitte. Mike, what you got? They got common market passports. The old guy who made them is so shook up... he can't remember what names he put on them. I got the cut-up passport photo negatives here... plus phony credit cards. Credit cards. Bruce, get on the credit cards... and piece those negs together. I got a source says they stayed with him... while you sewed up Berlin. Like to talk to your source. He says he doesn't know what time they left his place. No. I said I'd like to talk to your source. Anyway, I found a ticket agent in Frankfurt... who says that he thinks he sold them... two train tickets to Strasbourg. But he didn't stop them, because he thought... he was looking for two clean-shaven guys. Great. They're in France. Damn mustache. I don't get why they're sticking together. They'd be harder to find if they split up. Grigori. Forgive my intrusion, Elliot... but I believe we share a common embarrassment. I hope you will allow us to sit in. AS you know... I am missing an important gray attache case. Let us combine our resources in the name of progress. Well, it's... it's a brave new world, isn't it, boys? We believe our two runaways are headed for Paris. Doesn't make sense, Grigori. Boyd's never been in France. He doesn't know word one. But Grushenko knows it quite well. He worked at Unesco for us... before we transferred him TO Washington. Right. Pack it up. Wrong. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon. Out of the way, please. What now? Get off. Are you kidding? You want to go back to Berlin? I'm going to freeze. I guess this is your idea of fun, huh? I knew they'd wind up on phony credit cards. Yes. He came in just before closing time... and bought a heavy overcoat. The sleeves were a little too long... but he was in a hurry and he said he didn't mind. I told him that the alterations... What about the other man? Show him the next picture. This guy... did he sign the credit card? Let me see. Yeah. I think that is the man. So they haven't laundered the money. This is good? This is very good. They are in Paris. Thanks again for the coat. Yeah. It's nice to be alive, Mr. Boyd, eh? Oh, I don't know. Did you ever talk to anybody who was dead? Talking about the dead, President Johnson said... Mr. Grushenko, I don't care about President Johnson... or Magic Johnson or Howard Johnson. May I put a thought in your head? Where are we gonna sleep tonight? Patience. Et voila! C'est tellement bon de te voir. Mais quelle beaute. Quelle beaute! Comment tu vas? I'm sorry. Bonsoir. Natasha Grimaud, Sam Boyd. Enchantee. Hello. Nobody followed you? No. I don't think so. Good. What about the hotel? I made a reservation at the Esmeralda. I put it on my credit card, as you told me. Tres sage. I think I brought everything you wanted... 100,000 francs cash from my savings. Onyva, hein? Allez. We're in business, Sam. As I feared. How do they know where she lives? I'll explain it to you later. They're not interested in you. You're just going home, eh? Simple as that, OK? Hey, how do we get in touch with you? Why don't we meet tomorrow morning somewhere? Tomorrow, 9:00... at the Monument de la Deportation. It's just across from your hotel. I know it. Hey, hey. You watch that case, OK? I think I got it. Boone nuit. Et attention. Attention a toi. Bye. Natasha. She doesn't look Russian to me. She's French. Her mother was crazy for ""war and Peace"'... so they named her Natasha. She seems pretty keen on you. Yeah. She in the orchestra? IN the KGB? NO. She works for one of those big Japanese firms. She's the biggest capitalist you ever met. I think she's OK. I don't know how good an idea it is... to turn over two million dollars to a capitalist. You want the money changed, don't you? - Yeah. - I think she can do it. Oh, you think she can do it. I must be nuts. I just turned over our whole nest egg... to some blast from the past of yours. What do you think? Yeah. Hey, you look like Ringo Starr. Are you going to stay like that? Time for a new beginning, Sam. You sound very chipper. Oh, I know. It's the little chicky. Yeah. Did your wife know about her? Yeah, she knew about her. It was a long time ago. It was a very special thing. You were robbing the cradle. Did she know about your wife? Do you believe in anything? Yeah. Where's your girlfriend With our suitcase? She'll come. Yeah, well, she's late. There she is. Sorry. Sorry to be late. Ca va? Where's our suitcase? Safe. You look different. Excuse me, but where is the suitcase? Safe. Stop! Don't talk to her like that. Listen, in that case... is two million dollars in numbered bills. Two million dollars? We have to change those bills. If you can help us, great. If you cannot, I understand. It's not a problem, all right? It's easy. I can get the money... into one of our swiss accounts. Two million is nothing. I telex money all the time. By the time they trace it, it's gone. But I can't do is get it out. For that, you must go to Zurich. Can you give me accreditation? - DO you have a passport? - Yeah. Yes, I can give you the paperwork... and the access code to go with the name on your passport. They will give you the money in any currency you like. But why you? Why not me? You're going to travel on your passport? You've been signing your name all over. All right, go to Zurich. Go on. Go. Here is the address. OK. Take care of him. - Trust me. - Trust you? I don't know if I'm making a mistake or not. Now I'm turning over $2 million to a communist. I have to get back. What about the confirmation of the money to Zurich? Meet me tonight at the Cafe de la Jatte at 9:00. Cafe Jack? Where's that? You have all day to find it. Great. I'll go up on the Eiffel Tower... and look for it. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the summit... of the Eiffel Tower. You are now 300 meters above the ground. Elevators depart every 5 minutes for level two. Would monsieur care for an aperitif? Not right now, thank you. Well? Aren't you going to say good evening? I'm going to say good evening... right after you tell me the money made it to Zurich. The money made it to Zurich. - Good evening. - Good evening. You look very nice. I see you're wearing Lavender Ice by Maxine Grey. Bravo. Connaisseur. I like doing a little industrial espionage. May I ask you something? Depends. Pyiotr was in prison in the United States. What is he doing here? Well, if he didn't want you to know... I'm sure as hell not going to tell you. Well, if you don't tell me... I shall make a scene... then I will send a fax to Zurich... cancel the transfer of the money... and then I will go... to the offices of "Time" magazine... and tell them all about this. Well... I work for the government, kind of a part-timer. I was supposed to trade Grushenko for an American. Things got out of hand... and we were left out in the cold. You were going to send him back to Russia? It wasn't my idea. I was just... - Following orders. - Following orders. You and Pyiotr Ivanovich, the pair of you... do you know what you are? Dinozaurs. Dinosaurs? Dinosaurs. With your spy games, you are extinct today. Russia, America... who cares? You will kill each other, and it will be for nothing. In two years, all of Europe, including Germany... will be one big corporation. What's good for Toshiba is good for the world. Is this the kind of thing you talk to Grushenko about? Yes, before your people arrested him. You know, I think I will have a drink after all. Uh, do you have Storka? Mais oui. Thank you. OK, nobody move. Let's just keep it cool, fellas. What do you think you are doing? We ran out of credit cards... so we decided to tail you instead. Who's she? Grushenko's daughter. Where's your father? Where's your father? All right. Just take it easy. Now, we'll all go somewhere... and lay our cards on the table, huh? Grigori, apres vous. Yeah? Who do you like in the fifth? Sam, we've got your hotel staked out. Elliot. The girl is Grushenko's daughter. We've got her, too. His daughter? Jesus. OK, what's the deal? The deal is... Grigori wants the money and Grushenko... we still want Sobel... The girl wants to go back to work... and you want to go home and forget this whole thing. You know where he is? Of course. Where are you? I'd hate to see anything happen to her, Sam. She seems like a real nice girl. OK, OK, it's a deal. Some place nice and quiet. NO way, Jose. Some place nice and public. Give me your phone number. Come on, Sam. Give me your fucking phone number! 4-306-9921. Hey! Damn it! His special thing. Where is that commie cocker? Over there! Monsieur Henri Deplis... please contact the nearest white courtesy telephone. Monsieur Henri Deplis. Monsieur Deplis? Oui. C'est Henri Deplis. Did it go all right? I've been paging every flight. Where are you? Natasha and I are on top of the Eiffel Tower. Meet us here for lunch at twelve sharp, OK? Did you get the money? Yeah. Almost all of it. Great. Hey, we're going to celebrate. Are you OK? Trust me. Elliot. Goddamn it. Where the hell are you? You meet me on top the Eiffel Tower... at twelve noon. Grushenko will be there. You have your boys in place. There's a grey telephone there. When Grushenko comes up in elevator "A"... one of them will call you. That's when you send the girl down... in elevator "B" by herself so I can see her. You got that? Has he got the money? He's got it. Let me talk to her. Sam? When this is over... I want you to renew your subscription... in "Time' magazine." You understand what I'm saying? Yes, I understand. And believe me, I'm very sorry. Don't talk to... Enough, OK? We will see Pyiotr Ivanovich in exactly one hour... Ten minutes. Or she won't need an elevator to get off the Tower, correct? Yeah, correct. We got him. Move it! All right. Yeah, I'm now standing by. Over. Ladies and gentlemen, this is level two. There are souvenirs, a restaurant... and those wishing to view the summit of the Tower... must change elevators here. This elevator is for the summit only. Cet ascenseur pour le sommet seulement. 180, monsieur. Non, ca va. Ca va. Merci. Sommet. Ladies and gentlemen... this is the summit of the Eiffel Tower. You are now 300 meters above the ground. Jaffe. Elliot? It's Tony. He's on his way. Allez. Tire toil. Folks, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to use the elevator on the other side. L'autre cote. L'autre cote. Merci. Papal! Jesus! The other lift! It'll never get here. You asked me before what I believe in. I believe in you, pal. Aw, shit. Aw, Christ. Where is Natasha? They grabbed her. This is the only thing I could think of... to get her back. She's OK? Yeah, she's OK, fine. So are you. Come on, stand up. At least you'd better be fine after all we've been through. Elliot? We've got to have lunch. We're stuck here until they clear out. Monsieur. I have a reservation. John Jones. But of course, Monsieur Jones. May I take your coat? No. This way, please. Will you gentlemen care for an aperitif? Uh, do you have Starka, very cold? Of course. Two of those, please. Make it doubles. And a telephone, please. Yes, sir. How do you know she's OK? They wouldn't be standing around like that if she wasn't. Why didn't you tell me she was your kid, for Pete's sake? You must have been 12 years old when you were married. Trust me? I was going to. I think we were talking about some place warm. Beautiful beaches, temperate climate... lovely fruit, no extradition. Our country 'tis of we. Sounds good. There goes Mike, the creep. What would you give to know... what they're talking about down there? I know what they're talking about. KGB's still trying to recycle Sobel... but I think I can take care of that. What's going on? Remember Donald? Sweet tooth? I hope he picks up his messages. Do svidaniya. Do svidaniya.
