I won't wish you good luck because I'm sure you will all pass. MOM - GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR BOARD EXAMS! DAD - GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT! YOU CAN DO IT! Keeping to myself in a corner Having coffee in my own chair Hiding for weeks Shutting the world out Tears are dry as air Are you blind? Can't you see?

What is this? Mom asked for it. What? The results aren't out yet. -It's nice, big, and expensive! -But why? I chose that photo and the pink roses. And your smile… Take it down! It's so nice. It's like your stock knowledge comes from here. -You silly boy! -I'm just joking! -You! You deserve it! -Don't hurt me! Hey, why are you acting like children? -It's her! -Whatever! He was asking for it. Tell your brother to stop being lazy. Mom, why is there a tarpaulin outside? The results aren't out yet. It's your Dad. He's too excited. Talk to him. -Did you see the tarpaulin outside? -They haven't released the results yet. -So what? I'm already sure of it. -Embarrassing. It's embarrassing. My face is so big! Stella! Hailey! -Stella! -Robby! -How are you, Jimmy? -Hey. Why do you have a picture up by the gate? Oh. Grandpa… This is difficult. When are you taking sign language lessons? Does Hailey know? Not yet. I'll surprise her. Then when she sees me, we can sign together. Aren't you busy? You know, it's all I can do. Here we go again. But my daughter! Architect Mara Navarro. I think we should wait for the results. Why do we have to wait for them? You graduated from UST cum laude! You know what? I'm really proud of you. Because you will accomplish what I failed to. Dad, really. This is for you and Mama. There you go. Can you teach me how to do this? What for? You're the architect. You call the shots, I execute. You want it this way? I'll do it like that. I'm glad you decided to learn sign language. We're always happy to get new students. Excuse me. Here's your receipt and your schedule. -Come on. -Thank you. I'll introduce you to your teacher, but in the meantime, have a seat. -What's your name again? -Mara. Okay, Mara. Thank you too. You know each other? I think we're neighbors. You take care of her. YOU KNOW HOW TO SIGN? Just a little. ONE MORE TIME, WITH FEELINGS. Are the exam results out? -Yes, Dad. -And? I'm about to check here in the office. -Let us know! -Okay, bye. Sorry, Mara. I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. Sorry. Get some rest. Here. I want to figure out if this is really for me. HI, ARE YOU OKAY? I'm okay. WHY ARE YOU SAD? It's nothing. I'm fine. YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR KEYS? No keys. No, it's fine. You should go in. I'm fine. …YOU. OKAY? WAIT A SECOND. Hey, Gali! What do you think you're doing? Get down from there! Get down! You're driving me insane! No! Stop that. Stay here! You're crazy! I thought you were just going to get something. Were you going to jump? It's dangerous! You could fall, and your head would explode! You'll die! You can't die! I CAN DO IT. They might think I'm a murderer. Just stay here. Just sit. Sit down! No jumping, okay? Here. Drink some water. Drink! Here you go. Just drink it. Okay, keep drinking. No jumping, okay? No jumping. HOW DID YOU KNOW? Oh, you saw my drafting tube? WHY? So many kids. They're cute, the kids. Are they all deaf? THEY'RE ALL DEAF. Jimmy might take a while. His car broke down. Okay. ARE YOU OKAY? The key to my room will take a while. Gali! Stay right there! I'll call the security! Don't move! Stay right there! I'll call the security! Hey, be careful! Gali! Hey! My God. Damn you! DON'T GET MAD. SMILE. Why did you have to do that? You almost fell! Do you want to die? RELAX. I'M ALL RIGHT. What? I almost had a heart attack! What? What's wrong? I told you to go to bed! HI GALI, IT'S MARA. HAHAHA. JUST KIDDING. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR EARLIER. AND SORRY FOR MY MESSY ROOM! IT WAS DARK. I DIDN'T NOTICE. THANK GOD HAHA ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT. Mara, what is this? There's nothing in your fridge. -Mara, are you all right? -Are canned goods all you eat? You'll get sick! When's the next board exam scheduled for? Are you talking about it again? Your daughter is barely eating, and you're still asking about the exam? I'm just saying. That's all you talk about at home! "Mom, talk to Mara." -This isn't about you. This is about Mara. -"Can't Mara take the exam again"? Mara, maybe you just didn't study enough? You know, it might be best to come back home. You aren't doing anything here anyway. Look at yourself. Just come back home. -Then you can eat properly. -Why send her home? She'll just feel lazier! You don't have to do this just to make your dad happy if you don't want to. Stay here until the next board exam. Just tell me what you need. -Mom. -Mara, it's okay. -Why are you saying that? -Why are you pushing her? She's only doing it for you, to not let you down… I'M LIKE A FISH IN AN AQUARIUM BECAUSE MY WORLD IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE HEARING. For me? No, you don't have to. I still need to have your car fixed. You don't have to. I still owe you money. Me? Dance? I don't-- All alone, can't you see How I wish you'd stay with me Underneath the white glow Of the pale moonlight Listen to my heart's plea In the pale moonlight I fear a life that's sad and cold So come and lay down next to me Underneath the white glow Come on in. There you go. Move faster! So tiring. I'm out of breath. Hello, ma'am. I'm glad Gali found a partner. He's always here. Never misses a class. There's a recital in November. He wants to be part of it, but he doesn't have a partner. Good thing you're here now. How long has he been coming here? A long time. Teacher Laura knows him. I don't understand why it's so important for him to learn how to dance. He's deaf. He can't hear. Are you guys a thing? We're just friends. -I thought he was your boyfriend. -No. We're just friends. -Oh? -Yes. Look at him. You wouldn't know he's deaf. During… Shall we go? It's been more than five minutes. I'm going to tire you out. I like that. Make sure I won't be able to walk tomorrow! -Come! -All right. Good luck. SO TIRING. SORRY, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME FOLLOWING THE ROUTINE. IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KEEP DANCING WITH ME. Gali, why do you want to dance? I WANT TO PROVE TO MYSELF THAT I CAN DO IT. Let's go. Dance with me. Come on. Let's dance. Hey! You're annoying. So gross! Ouch. Mara, you have to put your weight onto Gali. Trust that he will carry you. YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. I WON'T LET YOU GO. PERVERT PERVERT. YOU'RE FUNNY. JUST KIDDING. What? THIS IS YOUR SIGN NAME. BECAUSE OF YOUR EYELASHES… THEY'RE LONG. You said you don't understand what you watch on TV. Here you go. TALIMPAO… WE WILL NOT FORGET God is my witness. Not all days are yours. You will not always be above the law. Everything you've done to me is etched in my heart and in my mind. All the suffering and pain, I will avenge! Every one of you… will taste the victory of the poor! Maria Amor! You're Gali's friend? I am. He's their favorite. Has he been volunteering for a while? Yes, it's been a while. When he came in, the kids didn't know how to sign. -Now, they're good at signing. -Yeah. They're able to practice signing here. A lot of their hearing parents don't know how to sign. So the kids can't communicate with them. That's why they communicate with their deaf friends more. The teacher's funny. Are they the reason you wanted to study at Gallaudet? WHEN I GET MY SCHOLARSHIP, I CAN HELP EDUCATE DEAF KIDS. ARE YOU FREE TOMORROW? NOTHING MUCH GOING ON. WHY? WANNA COME SOMEWHERE WITH ME? SURE. WHERE ARE WE GOING? YOU'RE LATE. SORRY, THE TRAFFIC WAS BAD. SHE'S THE ONE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT? CAN WE TALK? I'LL BE BACK. LET'S EAT. I'M OKAY, THANK YOU. ARE YOU GUYS DATING? NO. BUT YOU WANT TO COURT HER? I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT. REMEMBER WHAT ANNICA DID TO YOU? MARA IS DIFFERENT FROM ANNICA. WE'RE DEAF. THEY'RE HEARING. WE'RE DIFFERENT FROM THEM. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND US. GALI, AREN'T YOU WONDERING WHY SHE'S HANGING WITH YOU AND NOT WITH THE HEARING? DON'T WORRY. WE'RE OKAY. LET'S DRINK! GO AHEAD. You should go. I'M HAPPIER HERE. So, deaf people can speak? How about you? Can you speak? MY VOICE SOUNDS BAD. Come on. Just once. I HAVE A COUGH. It's Ira. She wants me to go to the office party. I don't want to go. WHY NOT? It's embarrassing. I'm the only one who failed the exams. YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU? IF YOU'RE OKAY BEING SEEN WITH A DEAF GUY. Delivery! Excuse me. Who are you looking for? Gali Pastrano. Gali. Okay, hang on. Gali, someone's knocking. Open your door. Are you Gali Pastrano? I've been knocking. I've been waiting here. I CAN'T HEAR. LOOK AT ME. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU. I'M DEAF. I TOLD HIM TO TEXT ME WHEN HE GETS HERE. Just give him the package. Ma'am, can you sign? Thanks for the help. Sorry for bothering you. Thank you. SORRY, ABOUT THAT. It's okay. Gali, I have an idea. Okay. Stay there. How cute. Go the other way. Girl! What's going on with you? You're not answering my texts. -I'm sorry. I've been busy. -Oh well. I brought your favorite food. So that we can be friends again after you eat it. You know what? Sir TJ's been asking about you. He's expecting you at the thanksgiving party. I'll try. He was really sad when you resigned. But he said you can come back to work even if you didn't pass the board exam. So, what have you been up to? I've been doing ballroom dancing. Don't you need a partner for that? Who's your partner? Gali. Are you dating? But you want to? Why not? …is this about you not passing the exam? Is this just a distraction? Distraction? Why? Because he's deaf? I'm just worried for you, girl. The party's right there. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE ME-- I'm nervous. Maybe we shouldn't have come. Gali, these are my friends. This is Ira. This is Dom. This is Miko. -Has Sir TJ seen you? -Nope, where is he? -Let's go! -Sir TJ has a project… Let's go? Hey! What are you doing? Sir, do you still have an order? The kitchen's closing. Ira, talk to your friend. Bestie, come on! Come back to us. Are you sure? I'll give you anything. Just do it, Mara. I'll think about it, Sir TJ. GALI, WHERE ARE YOU? Gali, I'm sorry about last night. I got held up with my friends. NO. I HAD AN EMERGENCY. I HAD TO LEAVE. Gali, what was your emergency? Is that why you weren't answering? NOTHING. IT'S OKAY. Are you sure? Gali. Are you okay? You look so serious. I'M OKAY. Are you sure? If you want to talk about it… I'M JUST LOOKING FOR SHOES FOR THE RECITAL. HOW ARE YOU? I'M OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? This is my sign name. I can hear. I'm not deaf. -Sorry. Me too. -It's okay. -I'm Annica. -Mara. She's Mara. -Mara, Gino, my fiancé. -Hello, I'm Mara. Let's go. We might get stuck in traffic. Okay. OKAY. She's pretty. Who is she? A FRIEND. KEEP LOOKING FOR SHOES. Gali, are you okay? I'M OKAY. LET'S START. GALI, ARE YOU FREE TOMORROW? I'M NOT SURE. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. WHAT IS THIS? It's a surprise. Have a seat. I am yours, you are mine In my eyes, you are beautiful All alone, can't you see How I wish you'd stay with me Underneath the white glow Of the pale moonlight Listen to my heart's plea I FEAR A LIFE THAT'S SAD AND COLD YOU GIVE ME JOY AND LIVE TOGETHER UNTIL WE'RE OLD SO COME AND LAY DOWN NEXT TO ME UNDERNEATH THE WHITE GLOW OF THE PALE MOONLIGHT And your beauty Radiates to the moon And the beat Of your heart Goes out to the universe And comes back to me To where I am You are my love You're the only one for me Listen to my heart Feel what I'm feeling Damn it! No, I'll deal with it. This is not my fault. This is all you. You weren't looking. I had the right-of-way. What right-of-way? Is there a traffic light here? -Is there? -Sir, I'm on the main road. Are you a cop? Are you creating rules now? What now? Who's this? Your driver? You got something to say? -Pulling out a gun? -Gali, I got this! He's deaf. -Deaf? -Go. Seriously? What, you wanna hit me? Gali, I got this! Just get back in the car! This is your fault. You were driving fast! Miss, don't lecture me. -But-- -You hit my car! Don't you lecture me either! You should be thankful you're a woman because-- Gali! Where are you going? …CAR, WHY? What? WHY DID YOU MAKE ME GET BACK IN THE CAR? I JUST WANTED TO HELP. WAS THAT WRONG? I didn't want you to get into a fight. YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME. I CAN DEAL WITH HIM. Gali, there was nothing you could have done. Gali, what's wrong? What's the problem? Why are you mad? YOU CAN'T JUST TALK. YOU HAVE TO SIGN. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU. I don't want you to get into trouble. WHY? YOU PITY ME? YOU THINK I CAN'T HANDLE IT? BECAUSE I'M DEAF? No, I just wanted to help you. WHY DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME? BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD? IT MAKES YOU FORGET YOUR PROBLEMS? What? Is that what you think? That's why I spend time with you? Why I do everything for you? Gali, what are we? Who am I to you? I DON'T KNOW. So, all of this is nothing to you? Was that just me thinking that you love me? WHY DO YOU LOVE ME? BECAUSE YOU'RE DOWN AND I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE. YOU NEED SOMEONE TO CLING TO. Yes, I was sad when I met you. But, Gali… Gali, I love you. WE'RE JUST GOING TO HURT EACH OTHER. LET'S JUST END THIS. So, that's it? Just like that? You know what? You're full of excuses. But the truth is, you're a coward! You're a coward. FOR OUR WEDDING, LET'S DANCE TO THIS. I WANT TO SHOW YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FRIENDS, AND EVERYONE THAT I CAN. I CAN DANCE WITH YOU. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? YOU'RE ALL LAUGHING AT ME. WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING FUNNY. WHY WEREN'T YOU SIGNING FOR ME? WHY? DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO SIGN FOR YOU? I LOOKED LIKE AN IDIOT. US ALWAYS TOGETHER. ME TAKING CARE OF YOU. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? AM I YOUR NANNY? WE'RE DIFFERENT. YOU'RE DEAF. I'M HEARING. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. Hey. I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU. PLEASE. I'M SORRY I GOT MAD. I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID. Why are you saying sorry? BECAUSE I HURT YOU. It's true. I was sad when I met you. But that doesn't mean what I feel for you isn't true. You don't need to say sorry if you don't feel the same for me. THE TRUTH IS I LOVE YOU. EVEN IF I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S RIGHT TO LOVE YOU. Why? YOU'RE HEARING. I'M DEAF. That's wrong. WE'RE DIFFERENT. YOU DON'T SEE IT NOW, BUT YOU WILL GET TIRED OF ME. EVERY TIME WE DON'T UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, YOU'LL GROW MORE TIRED. AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO EVER HAPPEN. Was that why you broke up? Gali, I'm not Annica. I wish you would give me a chance. WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER, SOMETIMES I WISH THAT I COULD HEAR. WHEN YOU TALK, I WISH I COULD UNDERSTAND YOU. WHEN YOU CRY, WHEN YOU LAUGH, I WISH I COULD HEAR YOU. I WISH WE WERE THE SAME, BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. -We're set. -Aren't you beautiful? YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. Just do your best. Who would have thought That I'd fall for you? Who would have thought That these feelings were true? Why don't I ever know why You keep coming back to me Even when sometimes I let you down? I will keep on searching For the meaning of true love Even if I'm alone for all my life Who should be the right one That I will love? Who should I give My heart to have? Why don't I ever know why You keep coming back to me Even when sometimes I let you down? I will keep on searching Underneath the white glow Of the pale moonlight Listen to my heart's plea In the pale moonlight And your beauty Radiates to the moon And the beat Of your heart Goes out to the universe And comes back to me To where I am You are my love You're the only one for me Listen to my heart Feel what I'm feeling Underneath the white glow…
