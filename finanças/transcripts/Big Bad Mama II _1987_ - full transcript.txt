(soft creaking) (dramatic music) (tense music) - This here is private property. - That's true enough. Since noon today it has been the private property of Mr. Morgan Crawford. Unless you vacate these premises at once, we'll be forced to evict you by whatever means necessary. - You do what you gotta do, sheriff, and I'll do the same. (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Aaron. - Daddy. - No. No. No. No. - Oh, no. - No. - Foreclosure notice, duly served, September 27, 1934. Come on, Mrs. McClatchie. Gather up your girls it's over. - You're wrong, sheriff. It ain't over at all. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (miners yelling angrily) - [Male] Open up the mines come on. We got to put food on the table. What's the matter with y'all? (siren blaring) - What are those men doing, mama? - Same thing we're doing, honey. Trying not to be poor. They got their way we got ours. - That's an awful lot of coppers, mama. - Sometimes the safest place for a rabbit to hide is right under a hound dog's nose especially when the hound is otherwise engaged. Things should be coming to a boil real soon. You girls be ready when they do. - [Polly] Yes, mama. - We wanna see the mayor. We wanna see him now. - Yeah, we want the mines open again. - You men constitute an illegal assembly. Disburse immediately or you will all be placed under arrest. Take my advice and go home now. - We got no homes to go too. - Yeah, jail's better than starving. (men grunting) (miners yelling angrily) - Now. - Now. - Look at them. Communist agitators I tell you. - Godless atheists. - In these unions nowadays everybody wants more, more, more. - That's right, mister, and we sure aim to get it. Alright, girls, cover them. - You won't die from this bullet, but you'll wish you had. - The rest of you up against the wall. - That's right, folks. Mr. Thompson, here would love you all to raise your hands. - Now, ladies and gents, we can play this hard or easy. It's up to you. (loud thud) Hit that alarm, lady, and your boss gets another hole in the head. Polly, put them up against the wall. Get the cash. - Filler up we're in a hurry. - Okay, okay. - Violin case indeed. - Now that's what's keeping our country down no artistic appreciation. - You'll never make it to the city limits. - Then neither will you, mister. Billie Jean, upfront with me and don't take your eyes off them. Now listen up. The four of us are going for a nice little ride, so keep your hands high and your mouths shut and there won't be any need for any unnecessary funerals. - Thief, you're going straight to hell. - Yes, ma'am, just as fast as I can. Now over with the others, buster, and don't make a move. (alarm blaring) No. (people screaming) (alarm blaring) - Sorry, mama. - Honey, you still don't have the hang of it yet. All it takes is a little target practice. (loud screaming) Go. (dramatic music) (guns firing) - Mama, they're shooting at us. - That's their job, honey. - Look out they're shooting. Get over keep down. - Go. (siren blaring) Better make it a short fuse, honey. - [Polly] Yes, mama. - Yeehaw. (dramatic music) (men cheering) - Did you get that? (loud explosion) Okay, that's our front page. Come on. When you go back to the hotel, get all my stuff plus this. Wire it home tonight. Put those photographs on a plane, not a train a plane. Tell them I'm after a follow up. - What about Mr. Randolph? You know how he is. - You tell him I just saw next year's Pulitzer rob a bank. - Whoa, I figure we got close to a $1,000.00, mama. - Yeah, Crawford owes us a lot more to that. - For what he did to daddy? - For what he's doing to everybody, darling. Pretty soon there won't be a square of Texas left that doesn't have his brand on it. - I don't see why we don't just plug him. - Time enough for that, Billie Jean. Besides I wanna get enough of his money to take us back east in style. - Mama, what they got back east? - Big cities, bright lights, buildings so tall they reach clear to the clouds. Hot damn remember I showed you pictures of them in that catalog? - Oh, boy the streets were paved with gold. - They're paved with dreams, and with enough money you can have any dream you want. - I wanna be a princess. What's your dream, mama? - I wanna see my two girls grow up to be fine young ladies. - Mama, who wants to be a lady. I wanna go out west that's where real the adventure is. - Watch your mouth, Billie Jean. Now you're going east and you're gonna be a lady. Mama, knows what's best. - Maybe, mama, knows something about the car that's been bird dogging us for the last three and a half miles. - No, but mama intends to find out. (dramatic music) (gun cocks) Better take a good look, mister. 'Cause it's likely to be the last one you'll ever see. - Well, to tell you the truth, Mrs. McClatchie I was kind of hoping to find you in the creek. - Polly, Billie Jean come on up we got him. - Okay, mama. - Now you've been following us for two days and you ain't no cop. So turn around slow and start talking. - My name is Daryl Pearson, Mrs. McClatchie. The Voice Of The West that's the name of my column in the Philadelphia Eagle. - Now what's a big city newspaper man wanting with us? - Well, nothing much really. I just wanna make you immortal. - Who is he, mama? - A damn reporter. - Well, a journalist. - You fixing to do a story on us? - I can put your faces on the front pages of every newspaper from Maine to California. - You're gonna make us famous. - I think you're a legend in the making. - Well, Mr. Pearson, most of the legends I know of are dead I'd just as soon wait. - Well, you can't just stop a free press, Mrs. McClatchie. - True, Mr. Pearson, but I can slow it down for a while. Your car keys, please and your wallet your pants. - My pants. - Matter of fact better give me everything. I figure a naked man's gonna have a real problem hitching in these parts. - I don't know, mama. I wouldn't mind giving him a ride. - Yeah, mama, can't we take him with us. He looks real nice. - Girls, I've seen his type before. He only looks like trouble. - Well, that's everything, Mrs. McClatchie. Thank you. Be sure you tell the porter no starch in the shorts. It causes shrinkage. - I can see where that could be a problem for you, Mr. Pearson. Come on, girls. Stop your sulking, Billie Jean. - I ain't sulking. - Well, you haven't exactly been little miss sunshine for the last hundred miles. Come on baby tell your mama. Come on. - Nobody asked me if I wanted to be famous, mama. You think you're the only one around here who has say in anything. - Billie Jean, I want you to take a long hard look at something. (dramatic music) They call them Hoover towns. Must be a hundred of them scattered across the state just like this. - I don't like to look at them. - Nobody does. Displaced folk with barely enough food to keep them alive. Important thing is we could be here ourselves. After your daddy died we didn't have nothing. Now at least we got nice things and good places to stay. We got them by doing things my way. You understand now, baby? - I know. But can't we be rich and famous? - Darling, in our line of work there's just two kinds of people. Rich and living or famous and dead. - [Polly] We going back east now mama. - [Wilma] Not quite yet honey. There's still some unfinished business to take care of. (lively music) - Gentlemen, my son. - [Male] Hi, how are you good to see you. - Nice to see you. Albert, thanks for coming. Nice to see you again. Hi. (telephone ringing) Gentlemen. - A well placed bullet could work wonders right now. - He's not getting off that easy. Sometimes the best way to kill a man is to destroy his dreams. - You got something in mind? - Honey, I've always got something in mind. (soft music) - Name please? - Mrs. Worthington Fuller of Austin. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Fuller. This is a private supper for Mr. Crawford's most generous supporters. Well, I don't seem to see your name on the list. - I suggest you look again. - Oh, Mrs. Fuller, here it is how could I have missed it. Of course we have a table for you near the back of the room. As I was saying we have a lovely table for you right up next to the podium. If you'll kindly follow me place. - You are being viewed by perspective contributors to my campaign. Jordan, smile. - Why should I smile when I am not happy. - I expect you to act like a governor's son. Now don't let me down. - Hell, mama, there's enough diamonds here to start our own Tiffany's. - [Wilma] And enough food to feed half of Texas. Seems a shame when so few have so much. - [Billie] What's the plan, mama? - Well, off hand I'd say we split up and case the joint. It might not hurt to mingle a bit and take inventory. - Good evening, ladies. I don't believe we've been introduced. - Mrs. Worthington Fuller of Austin. These are my daughters Paulette. - Hi. - And Wilhelmina H.- I'm Jordan Crawford. My father's running for governor. - You must be very proud of him. - What son wouldn't be. Well, there's plenty to eat and drink so please help yourself. - We're planning on it. - Uh. May I escort you to the buffet table, Mrs. Fuller? - Yeah. - My, oh, my what a lovely violin case you've got there, young lady. - Well, mama always said I should take up an instrument. - Then perhaps you'll honor us with a recital later on. - Oh, I wouldn't be at all surprised. - Why, yes, I'd love to. Would you mind? - Morgan. Mrs. Fuller, I'd like you to meet the next governor of our state Morgan Crawford. - I am honored, Mrs. Fuller. - I've been looking forward to this for sometime. - [Male] We were discussing the deplorable situation with the poor. What do you think should be done? - Frankly much to much is being done already. I've heard a lot of talk about starvation of late, but personally I've not seen any. Besides redistribution of the wealth is not only unhealthy but it's un-American. (male chuckling) - How interesting. I've always felt that the best way to fight poverty is not be poor yourself. (gun firing) - Hold it right there. - Everybody back. - Paulette, what are you? - That means you too. - Okay. (dramatic music) - Now that I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen. My daughters and I will be collecting for the needy. Your generous contributions will be gratefully accepted. Billie Jean cover them. Your wallet please. Come on, come oh, come on okay. Come on, come on cough it up. - Not now. I don't want this place turned into a shooting gallery. - But they're robbing your guests. - Jewelry can be replaced. Wealthy contributors can't. Now put that thing away. - Alright hand it over. - You too, mister. - I already have. - Well, at least this time you can keep your pants. You. Come here. Come on, junior. You're our insurance policy. Polly, watch them. It ain't polite to leave without saying goodbye. (gun clicking) Not this time. Billie Jean. - Yes, mama. (people screaming) - And remember a vote for Crawford is a vote for peace and prosperity. Let's go. (dramatic music) - How do you like my new car? - Well, I always have. It's my father's. - Sit back you're going for a ride. - I want him alive and her dead. - You know my father would probably pay a lot to have me returned unharmed. - We know. - Well, then you'll be holding me for ransom. - Maybe or maybe we'll just plug you here and now. - Aha, look I've gotta be worth more to you alive than dead, right? - You may have a point there, junior. I'm thinking about the worst thing I could do to your father. - I'd say you've already done that. - Not by a long shot. You'd say he's put everything he owns into this campaign, right? - Yeah. - Now let's just say you were to turn to a life of crime. Once that hit the headlines your daddy couldn't get elected dogcatcher, right? - True, but whose gonna believe that I'm an outlaw. - You leave that to us, junior. You have just enrolled in the Wilma McClatchie school of advanced criminality. (gun firing) - Let me have that McClatchie file. - All we could find is a birth certificate and her marriage license. - I want all the information you can compile on that woman. Has anyone checked out the house she lived in? - This morning looks like the place hadn't been lived in. - Well, check it out again. Now look right now public sympathy's in my favor. But in a few weeks those voters will be saying, "If he doesn't know where his own son is, "what is he gonna be doing as governor?" Now remember if I go down, I'm gonna take you all down with me. - The press are outside, Mr. Crawford. - Don't you think I know that. (people shouting) - Mr. Crawford, right this way. Mr. Craw ford for the Evening Post. - Mr. Crawford, over here. Mr. Crawford, over here. - Mr. Crawford. Mr. Crawford, any news on your son? - Ladies and gentlemen, please, please, please. Gentlemen, please. I want you to know and the voters that despite this personal tragedy I resolve to carry on my campaign for governor. Jordan, would have wanted it that way. I do thank you for your kindness in listening. Thank you, thank you very much, thank you. - Mr. Crawford, right here for the Evening Post. Mr. Crawford, right this way. Mr. Crawford, for the Evening Post. - You know I'm not really sure what's going on here. But I just know it's not a good idea. - Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion. Unfortunately, nobody asked for yours. - Hey, looks like it's a coming, mama. - Okay, take your place, honey. Better get your powder ready, darling. Trucks almost here. - Yes, mama. - Truck, why a truck. - This is your first run through, junior. All you gotta do is stand there and hold it. - At least you could've given me one that was loaded. - Don't worry (cocking) this one is. (dramatic music) - Hey, this is it a quarter a mile and closing. - Get down, get down. - We're not gonna die or anything, are we? (tense music) - Watch it shift. The end of the line. The end of the line. We got a real problem. (dramatic music) - Hot damn. - Hey. - Holy shit. When the company finds out about this, they're gonna have us shot for sure. - Don't fret too much, boys. I just might save them the trouble. Polly, Billie Jean crack it open. (dramatic music) - [Dispatcher] Attention all cars. Attention all cars. Armored truck is stretched across near Land jack Pass. Proceed immediately. (dramatic music) - You trying to impress someone. 'Cause if you are it ain't working. - What are you talking about? - You know how it is. Those clothes of yours were mine first. The shoes too, even that stupid little doll. - So what if they were. - Just remember that hand me downs come in all shapes and sizes and I get him first. (dramatic music) (siren blaring) - Hey, ain't you the Crawford kid? Yeah, I seen your pictures in the paper. What the hell are you doing this for, boy? All that many belongs to your old man anyhow. - Let's just say that junior here wants an advance on his allowance. - All ready, mama. - Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure. (gun firing) (loud screaming) (dramatic music) - No, mama, let me go. No, mama. - You listen to me. You are unarmed. If you go out there, you will be killed. - You ever drive one of those things? - I drive them I used to race them. - Well, I hope you haven't forgotten how. (dramatic music) - Looks like Polly's getting away. - Polly. - You men, you go after them. We'll take care of these two. (guns firing) - Come on, baby, let's give them hell. - You bet, mama. (siren blaring) (dramatic music) - You better slow down. - Slow down. - Dolly. - Round the back. - Just one little spark. (loud screaming) - [Wilma] See you in the funny papers. - Damn. (gun firing) (people cheering) - Good to have taught that motorcycle. - Yeah well I suppose there are some advantages to being a rich kid. (soft music) - I can't let you go. - You know something. Yesterday my whole life was planned out for me. Now today I'm playing cops and robbers for real. Crazy thing is that I'm really starting to enjoy it. - What about your daddy he must be worried about you. - Well, I guess there's a first time for everything. - Don't you two get along? - Sometimes I think we do. I don't know ever since mama died he's been like a stranger. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I'm not the son he thought I would be. See there are disadvantages to being a rich kid too. Come on I'll race you. - I won. - No, you didn't. You cheated. - I did not. - You did too. - I did not. - You did too. - I did not. (dog barking) Oh, mama. - I was so worried. Are you alright? You sure? Okay, Billie Jean, help your sister put that thing in the garage. Come here, buster. I wanna talk to you. Now look Polly is the dearest thing in my life, but she ain't to terribly bright. You could have escaped. - Yeah, especially with an empty revolver pointed at me. - Why in hell did you come back? - I don't think that you would believe me. - Maybe not. But I can't afford to take anymore chances inside. - Ain't he dreamy, mama. - Is that really necessary? - Well, we gotta do like mama says. Now open wide. - Better than playing with your dolly, Polly. - I can take care of things here, Billie Jean. You can go on back to bed if you want. - Oh, no, I kind of had some ideas of my own. - Not this time, Billie Jean. Okay, Florence Nightingale. I don't need him anyway. - You have to excuse Billie Jean. She gets a little boy crazy. - What about you? - I don't want every boy. Just one. (soft music) - [Male] Meanwhile law enforcement agents throughout the state are searching for young Jordan Crawford and his captors. Now back to our program. - That kid is hotter than the 4th of July. I say we ransom him and get the hell the out. - Patience is a virtue, Billie Jean. I got bigger plans for him. Well, in the meantime we're carrying around a time bomb. I say we get the ransom then drill the old man. That'll settle the score all around. - I wasn't aware you were calling the shots. - Well, maybe I should be. - And maybe you should hush your mouth and let me do the thinking. Killing is too good Crawford. I wanna break him just like he broke your father. Then we can get on to living our own lives. - What if I don't feel like waiting. You and Polly can go and be big city hot shots. Maybe I'll just pack my bags and go my own way. - You listen to me, Billie Jean. I don't wanna hear any more talk about anyone leaving. Honey. We're a family. Our greatest strength is in sticking together. Someday you'll know I'm right. - And what if, mama, just once you're wrong? - Well, your mama may not always be right but mama will always be mama. It's past your bedtime get, get. - Mama. (dramatic music) (water splashing) (tense music) (door creaking) (footsteps approaching) (door creaking) - Billie Jean. Billie Jean. - Are you the lady who called for room service? - What do you think you're doing here? - Well, I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd drop in and say hello. Would you care for a glass of champagne? - Mr. Pearson, you have a real knack for finding us. - Well, it's just trial and error. You'd be astonished at how many bathrooms I have busted into tonight mind if I sit down? - Mister, I wouldn't mind if you fell in and drowned. - Must be obvious by now that the last thing in the world I wanna see is for you to be captured. - Get to the point this water ain't getting any warmer. - See most of the things that you've gotten away with so far are because you always robbed the rich. People love that, that's a Robin Hood touch. - I never set out to be a public hero. - No, I know but that's what happened and now you are. Well, you used to be. When you snatched the Crawford boy, you kind of went over the line there. People don't like kidnappers. If your public decides the law is right and you're wrong, you're as good as dead. - Tell me something I don't already know. - On the other hand word has it that you took your hostage on your last heist. If I can convince my readers that he went along as a willing accomplice, you'd be as popular as you ever were maybe more so. - And you'd have a whole new series of articles. - So what do you say. But you better make up your mind quick. Your bubbles are starting to melt. - Alright, Pearson, meet me at the county fair tomorrow night at eight o'clock. But remember any cross ups and I'll put a bullet through your brain. - That's my least vulnerable spot. Anyway, it's kind of difficult to imagine a woman as lovely as you are capable of murder. - Oh, believe me. I am a very capable woman. - You bathe with that thing. - I also sleep with it, so don't get any ideas. Now get on out of here. - All right. Don't forget to wash behind your ears. - Out. (lively music) (people mumbling excitedly) Better give it back to its mama now, darling. - Okay, mama. - We're all gonna take a nice little stroll down to the ticket booth. I don't want you to say anything or do anything until I say so understand? Come along. - I don't believe this. They used my worst photo. - Keep it down, farm boy. - $1,000 my father's paid more for one of his race horses. - So how fast can you run a mile and a quarter. - It's still a lot of money. - Yeah, maybe I should turn myself in. (seductive music) Oh, my god I've never seen anyone move like that. - You liked the way I moved last night. - Did you know about this, mama? - No, but I've always had a fondness for family reunions. - Looks like a pretty turn out. - Forget that now. Is there any news of the boy? - Not yet. - I'm going upstairs now. You keep everybody out. (lively music) - Sound familiar. - I don't think this is such a good idea. - Well, your opinion would count for something if you had any say in the matter, which you don't. - Another unloaded gun. - You get what you get and do it now. - Stick them up. - Now. - How was that? - How was that? - It's gonna be under exposed do it again. - One more time, junior This time a little more oomph. - Stick them up. - Hand over your dough. - Oh, right. Hand over your dough. Or I'll plug you where you stand. - How am I doing? (gun firing) - Damn. - What's that? - What's that? - Come on. (dramatic music) - Come on. - This should shake them off. Come on fall out. (people screaming) - Let's go, let's go. - I thought we lost you there for a minute, junior. - We took the scenic route. - Well, welcome back to the fold. (dramatic music) (lively music) (people mumbling excitedly) (woman laughing) (lively music) - There's not to have truckers or politicians. - Daryl Pearson. You old son of a bitch come here. - Alma, you look like a million bucks. - That's about what it takes these days, honey. Hey, have you made up your mind? - About what? - Hon, this fella could never figure out whether he wanted to write the news or make it. I've been thinking about you a lot lately. - [Daryl] Is that right nothing good I hope. - [Alma] Oh, quit your ribbing. Now I've been thinking about how you ducked out of here owing me 200 Somalians. - It was 250 and another 250. I'd like to throw a little party for my friends. - This kind of money everything I got is yours and believe me that's quite a lot. Come on in folks. - Be careful. - This is what they call a social club in these parts. - I know what kind of socializing goes on here. - Well, it's just so many places you can go where they don't ask a whole lot of questions. - Hi, boys. What you playing? (lively music) - I'm not sure I like my little girls frequenting such places. - In case you haven't noticed, Mrs. McClatchie your little girls have grown up. - They've grown out you. It's not the same thing. They know how to handle guns, but I don't think they quite have the hang of men. - How about you? Do you have the hang of men? - I can take them or leave them. Sometimes I take them and leave them depends on the man. - See anything you like? - Still deciding on that one. But you'll be the first to know. Now let's get down to business. - I don't see how business could be going any better. You have enough money that you don't have to work for a while. Mr. Crawford's political chances are somewhere between nil and nonexistent, so where do we go from here? - Maybe we should quit while we're a head. - Now I don't wanna walk away from the table till the last hand is played. - Spoken like a true gambler. - Try me. - Draw. - Just as a matter to curiosity, what were the stakes? - Oh, Alma. - Yeah, hon. - What's your best room? - That'd be the Lotus room, hon. Why, what'd you have in mind? - A private game. (soft music) (soft giggling) - Yes and another thing. I saw you mark the ace. Don't you know that cheaters never prosper. - Honey, they're the only ones who do. - A pair of fives. Possible straight. A pair a ladies. Let's see the color of your money, gentlemen. - Shit I'm out. - It's gonna cost you 300. - I'm gonna raise you five. - Takes care of me. - Wise move, boys. Cash these in for me will you, sweetheart. - Hey, sugar, you can't leave now. - Look I won and I did it the hard way, obviously. I'm cutting in. - No, you're not. - Don't think for a second I don't know what's going on with you two every night. - That's none of your concern. - Everything around here is my concern. I know things may be lovey dovey with you two right now. But as soon as we ransomed him back, he's not even gonna remember your name. - Billie Jean, you've got-- - Stay out of this rich boy. This is family. - Jordan, just forget it. I don't wanna talk about this anymore. - Oh, well, maybe you'd like to discuss it with mama. - Billie Jean, you wouldn't tell her, you wouldn't. - I'm sure she'd be interested in hearing how you're making whoopee with the son of the bastard that murdered our father. - Well, you go ahead and tell her then. 'Cause I don't care if she does know. You know something, Billie Jean, I used to look up to you 'cause I thought you were everything I wanted to be. Now I can't stand to even be in the same room with you. - Well, go on back to your rich boy. Maybe tonight he'll even leave you a tip. - (people gasping) - Billie Jean, what are you? (lively music) - I got dibs the little blonde takes her. - Isn't it a little past your bedtime, girls. - Dammit Stark I pay good money not to look at your ugly face. Go on get out of here. - Well, that's too bad Alma. We closing this place down. Everybody here is under arrest. - You no good double dealing, son of a bitch. - Round them up boys and get any strays upstairs. - Stark, you get back here. Come back down here right now. Damn, come back down here, Stark goddammit. - Alright, get your asses up. You're under arrest. - Officer, my name is Daryl Pearson. I'm with the Philadelphia Eagle. I know that my newspaper would be very grateful to you if we could just forget about this. - I've been waiting to get my hands on one of you big city newspaper boys for a long while. - Okay, I guess we're off to the pokey then. But can we just leave the lady out of this one. - Like I said you under arrest and that includes your whore too. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Get out of here. Out of my house. Get out of my house. Get them out of here, out, out, out, out. Get out of here. (people yelling) - How bad is it? - I've felt better. - We better get out of here. (dramatic music) - Shit. - She's been shot. - Polly, Billie Jean, mama's been hit. - [Billie] Polly come on mama's been hurt. - Put me down, put me down. - Mama's still losing blood. - Well, a doctor over at Mescalero no questions asked. - That's too far. We'll be lucky to make it another quarter mile. - What's the matter? - Sounds like we've thrown a rod. (dramatic music) - Folks around here call my Doc Robey Looks to me you could use some help. You just come on in how. - Are you really a doctor? - Of sorts, missy. Course most of my patients usually have four legs. - Well, it's a gunshot wound. Can you do anything about it? - I probably can't make it no worst. - How bad, doc? - Don't look too bad. Don't look too good neither. But with a little stitching and a little resting you'll be as good as new. Now, ma'am, this here is what's known in the medical trade as an local anesthetic. You drink a half a bottle of this, and you won't even know where you are. - I'll settle for just not caring. Girls remember to change the plates on the car. We don't wanna bring any heat on this place. - Yes, mama. - Now you lie still. This just may hurt a little. - No, doc, I was really hoping you weren't gonna say that. (Wilma groaning) (gentle music) Is that you honey? - Yes, mama. - Doc Robey says I'll be back on my feet tomorrow. We'll be taking off then. Packed up a little early aren't you? - I already said my goodbyes to Polly, mama. That leaves only you. - I guess we both knew this day was coming. I just didn't expect it this soon. - Oh, mama. I love you so much. I just can't grow up with you looking over me like you do. - But, honey. - Please. I know what you're gonna say. - That's always been our problem. We're too much alike. Where you planning on heading, darling? - There's a long road out there, mama. I'll find a place. - I figure you finally got the last word. - I'll stay in touch some how. Goodbye, mama. - [Jordan] Getting some shots for the folks back home. - It's a new series of articles I'm working on. It's not as much fun as you and the McClatchies. But I'm gonna try to get it straight and tell the truth. - You know I never imagined there were places like this. - Somebody's gotta help them. - That's what the politicians should be doing. - Doc. I want you folks to have these. Souvenirs from a little party we once attended. - Hell, that must have been some party, Mrs. McClatchie. - A roof raiser all right. Get yourselves a good fence. You can get 20 cents to the dollar, I think that should be enough to carry you folks through to better times. - This ain't gonna leave you short is it? - Not likely. - What can I say? - Say you'll help any young in come scuffing in off the road. - You know, ma'am I believe accepting stolen goods may be a crime. - So is poverty, doc. - [Daryl] Where to now? - [Wilma] Home. - You're not thinking about buying this place back are you? - Somebody I gotta say goodbye to. He's buried out there. It's the last thing I did before they took the place over. I won't be long. - I have to go to town to wire in this week's column. - Take Polly with you. We need supplies. Tonight we'll be leaving this all behind us. - You mean it? Wilma, listen to me. - Don't say it, not yet. - When? - When we're out of here. Go on go to town. - Are you sure you'll be okay. - Get to town. (dramatic music) - Polly. Don't say anything till I get us a lawyer. - Don't look so surprised. After all, it is my car. - What are you gonna do with him? - A young person in your situation would be a lot smarter thinking of herself. I hope you are smart enough to understand that we have enough evidence on you right now to put you in the electric chair. Can you imagine what that is like? A metal electrode placed on the crown of your head and another one on your calf. 20,000 electrical volts scorching it's way through your body. They say that, that is painless. Somehow I find that hard to believe. Don't you understand that all I want is the return of my son. Now let's you and I be friends. - Nobody will be hurt will they? - Trust me. Just trust me. (dramatic music) - He was a good man. - You know, Mrs. McClatchie. Children shouldn't be held accountable for the sins of their fathers. - Maybe not. I tried awful hard to hate you but I just can't. (thunder roaring) Somehow that feeling has just gone out of me. Aaron used to say hates too big a burden for anyone to carry. Now I know what he meant. I don't wanna be messing with your daddy's life anymore. I just wanna get on with my own for Aaron's sake and ours. - So where do I fit in, in all this? - Well, it seems like it's time for you to start playing your own game, Jordan. - There is someone that I would like very much to share that with, ma'am. (dramatic music) Who is that? - Run that way let's get inside. Been waiting a long time for this, Stroud. - Now don't shot, Mrs. McClatchie. I came unarmed. - Your first mistake. But I didn't exactly come empty handed. Could be any store bought ribbon. But I say it belongs to your Polly. Now hold on now she's alright for the moment. - Keep talking. - Mr. Crawford wants to offer you an exchange. Your daughter for his son. - Then tell that bastard to get his ass out here with my daughter. - He will, but he won't be alone. Oh, don't think about high tailing it. Those fields back there they may look empty but they ain't. It's been nice chatting with you again, ma'am. - Hey, Stroud. - Yes, ma'am. - Next time come armed. - That I will, ma"am. That I will. - Come on out. Your newspaper paid for your bail. - Shucks, sheriff. I was just starting to feel at home in your jail. - Just look over your things and sign for them and get out. - What about the girl? - I told you I'm as much in the dark about that as you are. State boys just came in here and swept her out. Pearson, you wouldn't be thinking about going out to the old McClatchie place now would you? - Is there any reason why I shouldn't? - That's a bad place to be right now is all. - Yeah, I get the picture. Sheriff, you wouldn't happen to have a radio station in town would you? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Daryl Pearson reporting to you live from a small farm in northwest Texas where Wilma McClatchie is valiantly fighting to protect her daughters and her home. Alone she is defying the combined forces of millionaire Morgan Crawford and over 100 hand picked members of the state militia. - He did what? - Yes, sir. That Pearson fella hooked up a remote relay through the American radio network. Every move we make is going coast to coast. - You listen to me, Stroud I still have a chance to win this election if I can get my boy back and if we can take care of these outlaws. Now we may have to break some rules to do that. I want you to take some of these people right now and go over and pull that loud mouth off the air. - I can't do that, Mr. Crawford. They may be listening in the Capital. We're gonna have to play this straight. - Damn rat journalism. Are all the cars in place? - Yes, sir. - Remember soon as the boy is out of there nobody, that's nobody gets out of that building alive. Let's get this started. - Hit the lights. (dramatic music) - McClatchie. Wilma McClatchie. Send Jordan walking toward me. I'll do the same with your girl. When I say walk, you walk. When I say stop, you stop. No tricks you understand? Walk. (dramatic music) - Come on. - Son. - Jordan. - You son of a bitch. Polly, inside. - Your mama needs you go. I'll be alright go. - Fire. - Baby, you okay. - Yeah. - Jordan. - He loves me, mama. - Here take the window. If they decide to rush us, we're in dip shit. - Do you think that's? - It can't be anybody else. Give her some cover, Polly. Baby. - Mama. I heard about you on the radio. I had to borrow a car. Polly, I got a present for you. Don't say I never gave you nothing. - Thanks. - What's the plan, mama? - I'm wide open. - Hot damn. - And so it continues. Three brave women fighting for their lives against an invading army of trained marksmen. If there is any justice in this state, Governor Henry will call for the militia to pullback and allow the McClatchie's to surrender. If any of you listening to the sound of my voice are near a telephone call the capital call now and demand this carnage be stopped. - Polly. Polly. (dramatic music) - You alright, honey? - I think so. - You'll be okay. Mama. - Don't worry, babies. We go to a better place. - No, let me go. - There's nothing anyone can do now. (somber music) Pearson, no. Pearson. - I thought you were dead too. - Not quite. - That was quite a women. - That was quite a family. Did you know for instance that Aaron McClatchie built a cyclone cellar in the basement that could with stand almost anything even fire? - [Daryl] Wilma, didn't you know cheaters never prosper. - Honey, they're the only ones who do. (dramatic music) (lively music) (police siren blaring) - How am I doing, grams? - Just fine, darling. (gun firing) (lively music)
