A long long time ago someone told me the Arctic ice was pointed while the Antarctic ice was flat. I asked her why. She said, "The Arctic is an ocean." "The ice rolls down from the valleys so it's in triangles." "The Antarctic is a continent." "The ice slides down from the plain so it's in squares." I felt that she was so special. She loved triangles because a triangle was the most stable structure. She wanted to go to the Arctic. There were so many triangles there. She wanted to know more things, to go to faraway places. But I... just wanted to be with her. (I'm off to the cram school.) The number you dialed is not available, please try again later. Your call will be switched to the voice-mail. Please try again. The number you dialed is not in use, please try again, thank you. The number you dialed is not in use... I arrive in Nanyang Street. People who come here want to know more answers, want to go to further places. But I want to know just one answer, go to just one place. After all... I didn't run into Ying. I ran into someone else. Someone really weird. Hey! Be careful. You come looking for someone, right? So you need to look for work as well. Or how can you make ends meet? Here is a big chance for you. Good money, easy job, close to home! Start! Imagine you're printing money. "Shoo!" See, money keeps coming out! Wow! "Shoo!" "Shoo!" You'll be filled with joy. Enjoy your work! This guy who claims to be the chief of Nanyang Street tells me that as long as I concentrate on copying my mind will calm down. When my mind calms down, I'll meet the person that I long to see. Bullshit! But still... I not only follow his advice. But even begin to enjoy it. Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. -Excuse me. Excuse me. Exam papers! Exam papers! So I stay in Nanyang Street fantasizing that Ying would write on the exam paper I copied... fantasizing one day... I would run into her in the crowd. I'm like a student who studied the wrong text book sitting in the classroom expecting the answer to fall from the sky. (I'm off to the cram school.) I met so many weirdies in Nanyang Street. For example, this man is the most popular teacher in Nanyang Street. But I never understand a word he says. Good day, boss. Good day, everyone. Here in 'Sure-win', we're a big family. We're not running a cram school. We are the "South Sheep Farm"! The deal I'm telling you is really truly good. Usually, it costs $7,500 for one course. This girl's name is Tsui Pao-Pao. She loves money more than anyone in Nanyang Street. People say that the reason why she loves money so much is because her father, Tsui Niui, (Give my money back!) ran way after getting into debt when she was still a high school student. Since then, Pao-Pao has been making as much money as possible. She believes that only money can guarantee happiness. Just a second. It's on the way. Please fill in the questionnaire for me. It'll take only three minutes. Please, sir. Sir! Please, fill in the questionnaire... Tomorrow, okay? Tomorrow I... It's really important. You have to sit in the exam. If you don't, you'll be beaten by the others. Now we offer so many free trial lessons, it's a really truly good deal. It usually costs $7,500 for a course, but now two courses cost only $9,900! Look! You've saved more than $5,100! Isn't it such a good deal? What do you think? What did you say you want to be in 20 years? Warren Edward Buffett. Congratulations! You've taken the first step to success! Here are the exam papers! Hey, wait! You always dump them in the wrong place! Yang? Where is Yang? (Please leave your messages on "South Sheep Farm" Facebook.) (Maybe your sheepdog is waiting for you there!) This girl's name is "Yang (sheep)." Every day, she draws a sheep on the exam paper. She even comes up with the name, "South Sheep Farm". Well, that's a pun on Nanyang Street. Although her boss promotes her "South Sheep Farm" with such zest, the students never respond to her sheep. Where? Behind the green door with posters! Here are the exam papers. Oh! Leave them here. Are you okay? I'm fine. Hello. Why didn't you pick up? Are you slacking off? What? I'm busy working. What's up? Go to the sixth floor. Clear out the lockers. They're going to be torn down soon. - Alright! Check if there is anything valuable. And leave the rest alone. He is the "Golden Fried Rice Man". Prince Charming of Nanyang Street. He is always surrounded by a group of fans at meal times. Tsui Pao-Pao is one of the loyal fans but... she has some other purpose. Quiet! How many portions do you sell every day? I think you can earn more! The cram school I work for... We have 985 students. Apart from those who bring lunches from home, at least 600 need to get their lunches. If I put your menu on the notice board, you'll sell at least 100 more each day! Okay, thank you then. Our notice board is divided into A, B and C areas. Area A is in the middle and it costs $1,000 per month. Area B is on the side. It costs $800. C is on the margin. It's $700. Since you're so cute, I'll give you a 10% discount! Which area would you like? (Closing Notice) (With all my love.) Excuse me. Who are you? Oh, my boss sent me to clear out this place. That's my locker. Oh, I'm sorry. (Locker users' records) (Ying. No. 76) In her locker, Ying left nothing but me, the fool. (I'm off to the cram school.) I'm just like these things left in the lockers. We're all waiting for the people who abandoned us. I want to return them. I believe when their owners see them again those happy memories will come rushing back to them. Hello. Hello, can I speak to Mr. Huang? Hello. Hello, can I speak to Ms. Chiu? Huang? He's moved out. Do you have his number or something? No idea. Chiu? This is Jen-Ai Hospital. There is something urgent. We've got the result of the test... Can you tell me your address ? Junction of Nanyang St. and Hsuchang St. Opposite the noodle place... I don't know. Ask the landlord. Oh, okay. Thank you. Wrong number. Excuse me. Can it be repaired? WOW, a pager! Are you joking? So it can't be repaired? Of course not! Can't find any parts for it! Anything else I can do? Where can I find the parts? I can ask around for you. But... the chance is slim. WOW, a pager! Yeah. Anything important in it? Of course. Or why would I fix it? You don't remember what's in it? Huh? No, I don't remember it. If you can't remember it, it's surely not important! Pretend that things don't exist when you don't see them. (You'll definitely get what you lost back as long as you remain patient.) What are you smiling at? What's so funny? Nothing. Didn't you ask me to clear out the lockers? You found money! No, I didn't! Or what? I just returned the stuff left in the lockers to the owners. Wow, you're really good! I spent so much time looking for them but couldn't find anyone. Of course, I put a lot of effort into it. Are you saying I didn't? No, I'm not. YOU said it! Good service you did! Next time we should charge fees. This is an exception! It's what we call "One Good Deed a Day"! Haven't you heard? One Good Deed a Day? (Two things cannot wait) (1. Be obedient to your parents. 2. Do good deeds.) Thank you, sir. No problem. Next! Sir... What's up? My dog, Champion, has gone missing for days. I'm so worried that it might get hit by a car. So please help me. Champion's gone missing? Yeah. Was he forced to marry the princess? I'm only joking-. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll go looking for him after I put it down in the book. We do "one good deed a day". We charge only the minimum cost. $300 for tampering with exam results. Buy ten get one free. $1,000 for looking for a person. How about looking for a dog? Dogs are more difficult. They can't talk. They don't have mobile phones either. That's right! So it's more difficult. But that's alright. We're old neighbours. I'll give you the same price! Sure, okay. It's fine. I'm happy to pay no matter how much it costs! Tell you what. You've come to the right man. You know I'm an expert in bringing lost dogs home? Just wait for the good news at home! Please. Please. It's real money! Good. Wait for the good news home. -Yes. Thank you. -No problem! Champion! Okay. Next. Write down whatever you like. It's none of my business! Besides, tell you what. My quota for good deeds is used up. No more deeds until the end of the year. Don't be like that. Listen to me. The more good deeds you do, the higher level you go in Heaven. Besides, look at that. (Don't underestimate yourself. We all have great potential.) Well, I don't care... Hey! And there... (One who finds excuses for oneself will never improve.) You want to earn... -Hey! And there again... (The more you're suspicious of others the less confident you become.) Let's praise the Buddha! Okay, next! (Helping people brings you the most happiness.) Why did I mention "One Good Deed a Day"? Now I end up looking for some weird dog in the dead of the night. Before I find the dog, I run into someone even weirder. Have some noodles? (Noodles/Soup Noodles $35) Er... I'll have some noodles. Amen. Is that your dog? Oh, no. It's a customer's dog. I had a dog before. A very good one. Every night when I came home late after drinking, he always waited up for me at the door. One night I came home drunk as usual. But he wasn't there. When I woke up the next day, I found him dead on the road. Run over by a car. Later, I quit drinking. I went to a theological college and became a priest. Then why are you running a noodle stall? This is my hobby. Oh. Sometimes I think of my dog. How much I wish he wasn't so good... He should have left me earlier. But in that case, you wouldn't have quit drinking. You wouldn't have become a priest. But he would be alive and happier. (I'm off to the cram school.) Is she happier? I've been thinking about this question all night. Champion! Champion! Yummy snacks! Champion! Thank you. Here are the exam papers. Oh, leave them there. You like reading newspapers? Not really. I saw you buying paper last night. Last night? Um... I didn't go out last night. But the girl looked so much like you! Really? Weird... Well, maybe I was sleepwalking again. Sleepwalking? It has happened so many times since I was little. Very often, I don't know where I've been. Luckily, you didn't call out to me. Why? Don't you know? If you wake up a sleepwalker, he'll die! Bollocks! It's true! That was close! (11 people like it. 0 comments.) Told you it was a waste of money. No one has left any message. Yang, you're being too nice! Boss asked you to draw and you really did! You won't get extra pay for that! That's fine. I love drawing anyway. Why didn't you change the chart? Didn't we get the new results yesterday? It's almost done. Sir, would you like to have a look? Be careful. Listen. It's very important to look pretty. But safety comes first. Clean up the mess, alright? I'm sorry, sir. Wait! Thank you. Stop! Wait! I'm sorry. Are you alright? Let me take it off. It's fine. Let me take it off. -No, no. Off you go. Are you really okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Then, I'm off? (Photocopy Shop) (The shearing that went out of control reveals an unexpected look of myself.) ('Sure-win'. 200 copies) (I am all alone in this pasture.) (Look closely, you're not alone in the pasture!) Excuse me. 20 copies, please. Oh, okay. "I am the Knight Rider..." Anyone looking for me? No. No one. Papers for 'Sure-win' aren't ready? Not yet. I'll do it later. They need them right now! I'll do it myself. What now? Paper jam again? Didn't I ask you to maintain the machine? I do! You just tend to forget it! Damn! Hey! What? Nothing. (Look closely, you're not alone in the pasture!) Excuse me. How much longer do I have to wait? It's almost done! What are you looking for? No. Nothing. I'll deliver them myself and collect the money. Hey! What? Nothing... Are you doped or something? Oh my god! Hey, you messed it up! Why are you making deliveries? It's really busy today. Sir, have a lunch box! Excuse me. Sixth floor, please. Hot off the press! Excuse me. Hello, here are the exam papers. Where is the accounting department? Okay, thanks! Who dumped them here? Time is limited. Hope you'll make the best of every second. Write down the correct answers. Go! Everyone, time is up. Please hand in your paper, thanks. The Big Bad Wolf has come to get you! Such a big pasture... You're not alone! BYE bye. Bye bye! It's so cute. There are roaches too! Who is that Big Bad Wolf? The sheep is so cute! (There is a spider too.) (There is a goose too.) (There is a pig too.)

(Since I'm nobody's food, I feel so lonely.) (Please cherish your food. Make a love confession to it when necessary.) Can I have copies of these notes? And use this as the cover. This? Yes. Oh, okay. Hey, Pei! Come look at it! What's the sign of the Big Bad Wolf doing there? Really? Yes! Look, what's that? Pork ribs rice? Eh? Big Bad Wolf? Big Bad Wolf Pork Ribs Rice? Is it the wolf from the exam paper? The wolf from the exam paper! Come on! Let's go have a look. Yang, Yang - - - Boss is getting so mad! We forgot his picture in the notes. You put in everything but the picture! You, you! Let me ask you. Who is in charge of this? I... I don't know. Not me. Hey, I'm talking to you guys. Can you take it back to the shop now? Who made the mistake? No one?! Tell you what. Someone must be fired today. What about them? I'll cover you. Off you go! Hi, I'm sorry. The notes we sent in earlier... a page is missing. But... just this one. It was our fault. We didn't make it clear. Can you do it again for us? -Yes. Of course! Here you are. -Sure, no problem. This happens all the time. Absolutely normal! Sometimes it even happens 3 times a day! Let me help you. It's alright. It's fine. I'll do it myself. - Are you sure it's really alright? Thank you. Oh, sure. No problem! Champion! Champion! Come home, please. Champion! Champion! Hi! You! Why are you following me? Are you sleepwalking? You really believed it? Idiot! You're the idiot! Hey, I cared about you! Unlike you, liar! How would I know you would fall for it? I didn't know if I should call out to you or not. I was worried that you might die. You are SO nice! Yeah, right! Auntie Sticky Rice's Champion? You know it as well? Of course. I even talked to it. Talked to it? Wow, it's so busy here. Yeah, they usually come here around 2:30. Then... are you going to get a paper? No... not today. Oh! (Where is the wolf?) Sonny, our annual sale begins tomorrow. Let's have a special offer. Buy 1 get 1 free! What? Annual sale in a photocopy shop? Hey! The annual sale is our biggest event of the year! Why? Don't you know that we are the old...est shop? And some bloody new shop just opened next door! So, you, do the promotion tomorrow, Get it? And listen, wear this... This is the hottest thing in town. No. Do it yourself. What did you say? I won't go. Definitely won't? I absolutely won't go! Even if you're beaten to death? I won't even if I'm beaten to death. (Big Bad Wolf Photocopy Shop: Buy 1 get 1 free!) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 78. Thank you. 79 Thank you. 80 -Hi. Hi. What a costume! Shhh... Thank you. A question for you. What's in your mind when you're handing out the flyers? Thank you. I count from 1 to 100 and see when someone would take the flyer from me. Don't you get bored? No, not at all! Thank you. So nice. -Thank you. You know how to entertain yourself. And you? What's in your mind when you're holding the sign? I'm thinking... whether I'll run into someone or not. Who? My ex-girlfriend. Your ex-girlfriend? Champion! Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Wait... What's wrong? I'm sorry. We mistook it for someone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We should put up more lost dog notices. Or...how about folding the notices into paper planes and throw them out? Paper planes? We made a lot of paper planes and threw them out. Then... I heard the paper plane story about her. (seventeen) (eighteen) (nineteen) Hi. What are you drawing? You'll see. Ah! What? Nothing. I see. They're sheep. Then I know what I should draw. Yang loves paper planes because she feels the planes can take her sheep to somewhere far far away. When her illustrations were rejected again and again, only the boy who called the Eagle kept encouraging her. Can I have a paper, please? Why? I feel my sheep are really cute! Why don't they like my sheep? Alright. Stop crying- You're a big girl, right? It will be OK. No! No! -Okay, keep crying then... Okay. Okay-. (Top Score Chart.) (I'm going to study abroad.) The Eagle flew away by himself. Yang who was left behind told herself when she counted to 100 she would leave this place. He broke her up by a paper plane. Bastard! That's really the worst way to break up. Hey, the rent for your advert is $800. Are you paying in cash? Or should I dock it from the bill? (I'm off to the cram school.) Hello. Have you done a good deed today? I haven't done any for ages. What's up? Can you do me a favour? Sure. What's it? Turn left... Okay, stop. Can you see a scooter? There are a lot. One of them is sticking out. Push it forward. Okay. That's it. Good. Stop. The one on its left... Pull it back a little. Like this? A bit further. What are you doing? You'll see when you see them from here! Look, after you pushed it in, doesn't it look so neat?! If everything could always be so neat, wouldn't it be fantastic? You know you smell of paper? Smell of paper? The smell of paper... I mean the smell of exam papers... That's my favorite smell when I was little. Mummy, wake up! Mummy, wake up! Mummy, wake up! Mummy, wake up! Mummy is up! Don't worry. Mummy is waking up! If Mummy doesn't wake up, you just count from 1 to 100. When you get to 100, Mummy will wake up! Go! One two three four ninety four ninety five ninety six ninety seven ninety eight ninety nine one hundred So what brought you here was the smell of paper. No, it was the smell of exam papers. Champion. (Paper jammed into strawberry jam...) (God invented breakfast while the Devil invented late night snacks.) (Like men and women, there are rams and ewes.) (A wolf disguises as a sheep.) (What often arrives at the table is... surprise!) (God turned water into wine so the Devil created hangover.) (Row, row, row your boat, gently down the sea.) (A sheep disguised as a wolf.) Hi. Hi. What are you doing with all these boxes? Build a house. I wonder where Champion spends the night. Don't know... Maybe he's having a great time. He has forgotten that someone is looking or waiting for him. Maybe he's chatting and drinking beer with his friends. Isn't it better? Maybe. Everyone thought... he broke me up with a paper plane. Actually, when he began making paper planes I knew what would happen. All too often it's useless to do anything. If he had already decided to leave... It's hard to tell. If you had known it earlier, maybe you could have worked harder. Work harder? I mean... you know your weakness, then you try to improve yourself. Is that what you think? I often think... If I had woken up earlier on the day my ex left... Or the day before she left... I could have done something or wouldn't have done something, maybe we would stay together until now. You're so optimistic. You're so pessimistic. Sometimes that's what life is like. When the time comes, things just happen. So you think... people should do nothing but stand there counting from 1 to 100... Then it will be fine? It won't be fine... But at least you set a deadline for yourself. You'll know... that's it. How about him? Him? Don't you want to know what he's thinking? Of course I do. But only if he's willing to tell me, right? (Appliances Repairs.) Noodles? Wow, you even repaired pagers before?! This is my hobby. This person is very faithful. 1314 (pun on "Forever and ever") When I see the number in the pager, I think I won't feel relieved until I return it to its owner. Just as I'm trying every means to find the owner, I see Yang stare at an umbrella in a trance. What are you looking at? This umbrella. What's wrong with this umbrella? It's been left here for three months. (Don't abandon your stuff at will.) (In this chaotic world,) (apart from daydreaming with our eyes closed,) (what else can we do to make our farm a better place?) (Big Bad Wolf: It's cool to line the scooter against the white line.) (From the rooftop, our farm looks so lovely!) You know all the Arctic ice will melt in ten years? Says who? A student wrote it in the exam paper. So? So... I guess nothing lasts forever... Is that so? Yang Yi-Lun. Born in 1979. Found it? Boss. What are you doing in here? Nothing. What's that? I know this guy. Fall 1999. Yang Yi-Lun met Shen Yi in front of the locker. They shared the locker. They promised each other to get into their dream university together. Excuse me. How much is the rent for this? (pun for I miss you.) (pun for Forever and ever.) I'll call you when I get there. She got into the university but he failed. She told him she would wait for him forever. But this promise didn't last long. What happened then? Where did he go? They said one day thick fog descended in Nanyang Street. He walked into the fog and no one has seen him ever since. Boss, I found your comb. It was under the lectern. Thanks! Do you have a mirror with you? Why are you all here? This guy... looks so familiar... Boss... Isn't it an old photo of him? Give me! Stop pushing! Sonny, looking for a place to stay? Welcome! You see? A house, all to yourself. Imagine you're printing money. Shoo! One! Shoo! Another one! Come on, repeat after me. Press it when I count to 3. 1,2,3! (For Rent) How much longer do I have to wait? I'm sorry. It's almost done. Hey, how much longer will it take? I'm sorry. Two more mins. Forget about it. Hello. We just opened today. Would you like some free fried rice? Wow, he's so cool! If he doesn't want the pager any more, let's keep it. But... maybe when he sees the pager, he'll remember it. Oh. (Don't abandon your stuff at will.) (1314 Fried Rice Man) Thank you. Hey, let me ask you a question. Thank you. Ir... just if... if you never run into your ex-girlfriend, what would you do? I don't know... Would you like to try my method? What method? You count from 1 to 100. When you get to 100, maybe your ex will appear. How could it be possible? Well, it's just a method. But... if I count to 100, and she still doesn't appear? Then... maybe she'll never appear... Are you counting? I've got work to do. I need to run. (Big Bad Wolf Photocopy - Buy 1 get 1 free!)

(If I want to see the Wolf, will he say yes?) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (I'm off to the cram school.) Don't you stay till you get the annual bonus? That's a long wait! Don't be so fussy. Stay for few more days. It's been 100 days. How about me giving you $1,000 and you stay for another day? Well, another two days? Give me a hug. You said you came looking for someone. It's been ages. Have you found her yet? You haven't or you don't want to? Actually, I'm afraid of seeing her again. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid that... she'll tell me the answer. Well, it's either "Yes" or "No". What are you afraid of? What if she says "no"? No? No big deal, right? If she says "No", it means nobody loves me. Silly boy, you're afraid that no one loves you because you don't know who you love. This sheep... The more I look at it, the more I like it. It looks so cute, so lovely. Hey, there is a number! A lottery number? Is it 10 or O0? Is it a code? (Today is a good day to leave.) (If I want to see the Wolf again, will he say yes?) At this moment, I suddenly realize how stupid I am. Maybe 1314 (Forever and ever) doesn't exist, but '1314' is just a set of numbers. It appears in every hour, every minute, and every second. And I have missed it so many times. (Exam hour: 18:00-19:00) It's an ancient text so the calligraphy looks more primitive and older... Free English lectures. Have a look! Free English lectures. Have a look! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Here is your sticky rice. Thank you, Auntie. Bye, Auntie. Thank you. It seems very easy. But if you ignore it or forget it... If it's in the exam, and you fail because of it, don't blame me. As to the Chinese characters... After the Clerical script, they were no longer pictograms... So in other words... Hey, why do you seem so excited today? Why are you so restless? What's wrong with you? We need to go out for a minute. Where are you going? Excuse me. Can I go out for a minute? Why? Can I go out? These three points... remember them. They're very important in the exam. My boss says that as long as I concentrate on photocopying, I'll meet the person I long to see. The priest says that people who know when to leave will be happier. Yang says that count from 1 to 100, if one doesn't appear, one will never do. I say that the Big Bad Wolf can not only share the pasture but fly with the sheep in Nan-yang Street. (If you want to see the Wolf, fold this paper into a plane) (and throw it towards the sky today at 18 hr 13min 14sec.) (Turn your head around and you'll see the Wolf following the Sheep 1314) Long time no see. Long time no see. What are you doing here? I go to the cram school here. What a coincidence! Me too. I'm running late. I need to go. Bye. Hi. -Hi. Thank you. Big Bad Wolf. It's nothing. Then... I'm leaving. You still want to leave? I've counted to 100. I must leave after that. Then... can you... stay? No. But you can come to see me. I'm moving to the next street. It's close. What? I found a new place next block. It's bigger and cheaper! What? Just five minutes' walk from here. Very close. Then why did you quit? Because I found a new job! They like my illustrations. So where are you going? Me? Just hanging around. Nothing. Nothing? Nothing. If you've got nothing to do... Help me move! O k3)'- My lesson in Nanyang Street is over. I didn't become a smart guy. I'm still the student who studied the wrong text book. But I've learned one thing. The answer does fall from the sky. But on the condition that you have to shoot the answer up to the sky in the first place. These bloody youngsters... What the hell were they thinking? So much... I won't finish cleaning it up till dawn. Romantic? A little gesture would be enough! Why did they have to go this far? Out of my way! It's all your fault! It's your fault that I've got so much to do! Let me make it clear to you. This is the last time. I won't work with you anymore. (Don't underestimate yourself. We all have great potential.) I thought you were Christian. Hallelujah!
