The last decade has seen a renaissance for international terrorism. This has been precipitated, at least in part... ...by a status quo of negotiation and concession... ...enabling many recent terrorist actions to be successful for their perpetrators. These successes increased the various groups' perceived legitimacy. In overseas news, US Special Forces have made a disastrous attempt... ...to free 52 Americans held captive in Iran. Casualty... Back at home, exactly one year ago tomorrow... ...the British people voted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher into power. Mrs. Thatcher's unswerving commitment to economic and social reform... ...has been controversial, and she remains a divisive figure in a tenuous position. On today's program... That kind of resource is not adequate. Though we have to leave it. Mr. Timms, thank you. With the bank holiday nearly here, many Londoners will be planning to go away. But for those left in the city, there will be plenty of diversions. [God is with us. ] Get down! Get down, or you die! Everyone out! Out! Hurry up! Get down! - Sam Harris, BBC. - Everyone, on your knees! Down! - Down! Down! - Do as he says. Okay. Good. Hassan. Don't be stupid, you'll get us all killed. Don't move! Don't talk! You... ...you want to die? I said, 'you want to die?' It's definitely the Iranian Embassy. Weren't Chris and Sim getting visas for Iran today? Oh, bloody hell. - No closer. - BBC. I have colleagues in there. Yeah, back, I said. - What's going on? - Hey, you can't do that. Free country last time I checked, pal. No, no, no, no, no! Get back! All of you, get back! - Wait, wait, wait, wait! - I'll be back. - Bring negotiator now! - Shit. I want a negotiator here now! Tony, you're not going to believe this. Clear! Go! Go! Go! That was shit. - How's that, then, Roy? - You never checked behind the door. - Oh, fuck. - You're dead. So is he. All right, boys! Get yourselves outside now! - Outside, boys! - Someone's pushed the wrong button. 30 seconds! Let's go! Now! Now, boys! John! What's the deal, mate? Don't tell me it's a fucking exercise. Nah, terrorists in London. Multiple hostages. - Huh? - We're finally fucking on. Right, lads. We're off to London to meet the fucking queen! Do some shopping. They say they are the Democratic Revolutionary Front... ...for the liberation of Arabistan. They demand the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Iran. What is it? Unless these demands are met, they will kill a hostage at noon tomorrow. Perfect timing. You know DS Tucker. - Of course. - Max. Tom Lovett, you'll be supporting him on the day shift. We were both on the Bramshill negotiators course. - I remember. - Good. Time to put theory into practice. We know they have one of ours... ...a PC Trevor Lock of the diplomatic squad. Yeah. Armed... Smith & Wesson.38 revolver. Don't know if he's used it, still got it or what. If he's still got it, they won't expect an English copper to be armed. Yes. Could be a good or a bad thing. Gotta keep them talking. Standard army field phone. No listening devices, so nothing to find. But we hang up here, it's off. They hang up, it stays open. Never switches off. Which means that, well, we can hear anything they say within range. - That's very clever. - Yeah. Well, let's get on with it, shall we? Police are settling in tonight for a long wait around the embassy in Kensington. The embassy's in Princes Gate, just off Kensington Road... ...and the area almost from the Albert Hall to Ennismore Gardens has been sealed off. Dozens of people from nearby houses and offices... ...in this most fashionable part of London have been evacuated. I live right through London throughout the war... ...so bombing was something that I was brought up with. Metropolitan police are by now all too experienced in this kind of incident... ...and well-oiled plans have sprung into action. In scenes more reminiscent of North Ireland or America ...guns appear on the streets of the capital. The question here, too, is, do authorities face terrorism... ...with negotiation or force on British soil? This is Kate Adie, live from Princes Gate. The rest of today's news a little later and of course we'll be going back... ...to the embassy if there are any developments. - I'm starving. - Here. You'll need to be. - Guess what I just heard? - What? The terrorists called BBC Television Center. - What are they demanding? - I don't know. I guess the real question is what will Mrs. T and the government concede to them? I don't know. Not these bloody sandwiches, I hope. - You've had worse. - When? - No, don't get up, gentlemen, please. - I think you know everyone. MI5, MI6. Metropolitan Police. - Colonel Rose? - Special Air Service. Well, I have spoken to the Prime Minister, and she is firm... ...the rule of British law must be applied here. On that she will not be swayed. So... ...what is the first order of business? To determine the government's bottom line on negotiations. And under what conditions the SAS would take over from the police. We can't give them what they want, I'll tell you that much. The Iranian government are point-blank refusing to play ball. They're not releasing anyone from jail. Well, are your men ready to go in, Colonel, if need be? An immediate assault plan has been drawn up based on what little intelligence we have. If it comes to it, it won't be pretty. Fucking press are everywhere. Do not let them make you. All right. Just remember, lads... - ... we're cleaners. - Aye. Cleaners armed to the fucking teeth. Now, this is more like it, lads. ...no sooner did the Iranians burst into the Iranian embassy... ...police interpreter made the first contact with them... ...and began the delicate task of trying to get the hostages released... ...and find out what precisely the raiders wanted. They are demanding the release of 91 Arabs held in prison in South Iran. If the demands are not met, they will blow up the hostages and themselves. Police are keeping the Foreign Office informed of developments... ...but they are in full charge. Most of the negotiations have been conducted with one man. The police are operating with their customary caution. Fewest possible details of the police operation have been disclosed. In a tense reference to the siege, in the Commons this afternoon... ...the home secretary said, 'we are in the middle of delicate operations. ' Of course we assume there is a significantly greater number of Iranian hostages... ...mostly staff of the embassy. He reiterated that police aid... ...the release of the hostages without bloodshed. Iranian government's accused western governments... ...it's the west's fault, as usual. Have you seen this? Dear old mail. Never fails. This, apparently, is our fault. Watch out! BBC are here, inflaming the situation as usual. - Piss off, Jimmy. - Yeah, piss off, Jimmy. Okay. Let's get on with it. Nice cape. Thank you. Hey. Tom didn't go home last night. - You're joking. - No. Wish I was. Stayed here with the night shift. He's wound tighter than a horse's arse. Seen this? A hostage in the embassy called the BBC's London office. - It was leaked from there. - I thought they cut everything. - Apparently there's a phone still operating. - We can't negotiate in the bloody press. One hour till deadline, boys. Maggie's made it clear anybody gets killed, she's sending us in. - Is there anything else we should know? - No. It's a black hole. So it's in through the front door and hope the whole place doesn't go 'bang', then. Right. - You all right, mate? - Yeah. Get him talking. We need to buy some time. Hello? He demands the release of his comrades in Arabistan. Your government must or they will take action. Tell him our bosses are looking at their demands, trying to contact Iran. They have already talked to Tehran. Tell them they have no power in the situation. They're trapped. - Don't they understand? - Tom... What did the Iranians say to them? They welcome all the hostages to be martyrs... ...for the great Islamic state of Iran. This is Sunray. Stand to. 15 minutes till deadline. Stand to. We're on, boys. Let's fucking have it. Max... ...the army's next door, champing at the bit to get in. I think the boss said it's the SAS. You serious? - That's all we need. - Word from upstairs is... ...if someone's shot, they go in. We'd better make sure no one is. Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you speak English to me? Do you speak English? Yes. I speak. My name is Detective Chief Inspector Max Vernon. Where is the woman? She's not here. Will you speak directly to me? I want to help you, Salim. You don't help, we will kill them. No, no. If you do that... ...then I won't be able to help you. Do you understand? In five minutes, we kill unless you follow our demands! Salim... ...listen to me, please, very carefully. Will you do that? My government is not on friendly terms with your government. Even if they were, we can't force the Iranians... ...to do anything they don't want to do. Please. Understand, we can't release prisoners in Iran. That's simply beyond our power. The Iranians have washed their hands of us. You and I have to solve this now. If you were to release a hostage, it could help. You think I don't know what you are doing? - I'm trying to help you. - You are preparing to attack! No. Believe me when I say this, Salim. I want this to be resolved peacefully... - ... without violence. - Every day in my land... ...it is violence on my people by the Persians. I can't do anything about that. I wish I could, but I can't. But right here, right now... ...you and I can stop violence. If you help me. There's still a chance. Christ! What's going on in there? Stand by. Salim. Salim. He's been shot. Salim! - Where were you shot? - What? No. I'm sick. I've got gut rot. - I need to talk to the bloody police. - All right. Just lie back. Let go! You mustn't go in there. You've no idea what's waiting for you. Yeah. They've released a hostage. Says they're armed to the teeth. That man was ill. We let him go. Thank you, Salim. Stand down. I say again, 'stand down. ' - Thank you. - If you don't meet our demands, they die. We have food. You must be hungry. Let us feed you. - You bring, Mr. Max. Only you. - Right. Do we have any food? Whitehall is saying back off. You've gotta be joking, boss. Fuck. They released a hostage. There have been developments with the siege at the Iranian embassy in London. We now cross to Martin Young. The hostages, most of whom are Iranian... - ... are about to receive their first meal... - Mum, it's Dad! Policemen have brought food in containers, which have been placed on the ground... ...near the front door to the embassy. A lone policeman now carefully opens some of the compartments... ...for the gunmen to inspect at a distance. The policeman takes care that none of his movements can be interpreted... The containers are now placed in a box that is fixed to a pole... Who the fuck is this? He will now wait for the container to be removed from the box. The gunmen move cautiously as they take the food inside. Mr. Max. - Yes? - You tell them... ...we will kill a hostage if our demands are not met. You tell your government we will kill. We want Arab ambassadors now. One of the mad police. He's gonna get himself killed. I'll bet he's never seen a weapon in his life. Can you give me more time? I want to help you. I need more time. And we want two buses... to take us to Heathrow. All right. I'll ask the bosses. Please understand, it won't happen quickly. One more day. That is all. - 48 hours. - No! Salim, please. Everything takes time here. It's complicated in London. I want to help you. Please, let me help you. 48 hours. After that, we begin shooting them. - Fucking police. - ... and the conversation... ...appears to be at an end. That was Martin Young from the scene at Princes Gate... ...where all but one of the hostages... London senior policemen seem confident that caution and patience... ...will bring this matter to what they call a 'non-violent conclusion'. Well, this 'softly, softly' approach is designed to put pressure on the gunmen... ...whom it's assumed are already nervous and getting tired. What do you think might be in the minds of the terrorists now? I imagine they feel quite excited and elated. In a sense, things are going their way pretty well. Post-World War II Soviet anti personnel fragmentation grenade... ...also known as the RGD-5. Very destructive in confined spaces. 4 ounces of high explosive, 350 steel fragments, if you're interested. The X-RAYs have got at least one each. And they claim to have a doomsday device. So, 30-plus rooms over six floors rigged with explosives. Each terrorist ready to pull the pin for Arabistan. Aye, it'll be a real wild west show, boys. Aye. The new deadline is 48 hours. The head shed's drawing up plans that avoids storming the embassy. But we need a new immediate action plan in case these inmates... ...go off their medication sooner. Preferably one where everyone doesn't die. We know there are some hostages on the second floor. The intel's never going to be perfect, ever. The clock will be fucking ticking. What about soll ladders? Here and here? Too exposed. Always fight down, right? Look. Excuse me, let's have a minute. Based on the intel that we have right now... ...we make our approach... ...from the roof. Yeah? We use caving ladders down at these top windows... ...we make entry, we dominate the area where the hostages are being held... ...and then we fight our way down from there. Click. Stronghold. Fucking Einstein over here, huh? There's at least 25 of them. Five women, maybe more. All got families, all got lives. It's a bloody nightmare. And Trevor Lock. - Yes? - You tell your government... ...one more day. We will kill a hostage unless our demands are met. We will kill until you bring an ambassador here with the bus. Hector's got a new plan. We're gonna give them a bus... ...gonna let them take the hostages to Heathrow... ...then we're gonna take the bus. Piece of fucking cake. Clear! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! You're a dead man walking. The army now appear to be directly adjacent to the Iranian embassy... ...although officials continue to deny their involvement. The police haven't actually seen any of the hostages so far. They will say that food has been taken in but no personal contact has been made... ...between the police and the hostages. For their part, the police feel that as long as the government... ...are letting their deadlines pass, then there's a strong hope... ...that their suicidal fervor will wane. That was shit. There don't seem to be any hard and fast rules, but in general... ...experience suggests the longer it goes on... ...the less likely it is to end in tears, so to speak. Nah, too slow. Need to get it down to six seconds. We assumed that they are going to break down by certain techniques... ...that we know work on western people. It's a false assumption. So to sum up, I mean, everyone involved there... ...police psychiatrists and psychologists are facing perhaps the trickiest situation... ...we've experience so far in London, in your view? That would be fair, yes. Go! Go! Get down! Get down! Clear! Last bullet. Clear! There will be no bus assault at the airport. It's ready. And workable. It didn't work for the Germans at Munich... ...and this government will not copy their failed plans. The special projects team are elite soldiers. But they are not superheroes. They have never been used on British soil. Certainly never assaulted a six-story building filled with civilians... ...and terrorists ready to blow themselves up if we attack. Are you saying your men can't handle it? I back them 100%. They know the risks. But be certain you do. Now, I would advise you to seriously consider any plan... ...that avoids a stronghold assault. On the positive note, the Arab League have agreed to help with negotiations. There may be an impediment to that. The Prime Minister believes it is vital that this country... ...is not seen as a soft target for terrorism... ...especially in light of the troubles. She has instructed me to make it plain... ...that the terrorists will be subject to the laws of this land. And under no circumstances will they leave this country. So it's jail or a box? Well, we're still talking to the Arab League to see if they will help... ...so it's not a total dead duck. We need to give them something tangible... ...make them feel like they've achieved what they set out to do. Maybe they'll give up. Well you'd better think of it before noon tomorrow. Because if they do start shooting, the SAS will go in... ...and it'll be a fucking bloodbath. All right. This is good. Perfect point for abseil tie-offs. Watch it. Oh, my. Looks like happy families down there. And that on the green might well be the... - You all right, mate? - I need a word. Fucking hell. The... the Brass won't sanction the bus plan. - Why? - Politics. Fuck's sake. The colonel's ordered us to prepare a stronghold assault. We've waited too long, then. - Roy, they're gonna be fucking waiting... - No, no, no, no. We've found a light well on the embassy roof that wasn't on the plans. It leads all the way down to a glass panel on the second floor. - That's perfect for a distraction charge. - Exactly. Hector wants me to detonate it, right? So I want you to step up and take my place as assault team leader with Tom. Don't you think it'd be better to use one of them? One of the older guys? - I mean, I'm only three years in... - I've thought it through. Do you want the fucking job or not? Yeah, I want it. Call signs. And, Rusty, mate, aggression's good. Control's the key. Yeah? This is how it will go down, mark my words. Mrs. Thatcher's gone in for a fight. You're dreaming if you think we're gonna go in there and clean this up nicely. We have an alternate plan that will guarantee every hostage comes out alive. We have entry into the embassy... ...through a skylight. An assault squad could enter under cover of darkness... ...with silenced weapons. We could neutralize the terrorists. You can't be serious. Who do you think we are? John Wayne? I can hear the sphincters tightening in Whitehall as we speak, Mike. And the headlines... 'SAS Assassination Squad'? I'm sure. But no other plan comes close. I'll take it to the Prime Minister. But I know what the answer will be. It's down to the negotiators to break the deadlock... ...or your men will have to storm the embassy. I just wish the army would hurry up and storm the place. What? 'If it bleeds, it leads'. It's gonna make our careers, Kate. Are we really part of the same profession? I don't think we're part of the same species. When was the last time you printed the truth? You know the old saying... 'you make me sing, make it dance... - ... make it up'. - Jimmy... ...omit emotion, report the facts, remember? It's not a football match. That's boring, isn't it? Look, trust me, all right? I've covered every siege since Troy, and the army are not going to attack. - Oh, yeah? How's that, then? - Look at it. The place is a fortress. Be an absolute slaughter. Hassan! Hassan! [Faisal... Faisal, calm down. ] [No more talk. ] Get down! Something's got them wound up. - Sit up! - Can't you see he's not well? [We have waited long enough. ] [What are we doing?] - [Quiet. ] - [They lied to us... ] [They lied. One day they said... ] [... and the police would give in. ] - [I don't want to die here. ] - [Salim. ] Salim. There is an argument between Salim and this other one called Faisal. Faisal says all they do is talk. They need to show they mean their threats. They have agreed they will kill a hostage unless their demands are met today. Max. Can I have a word? The Arab League has refused to be part of negotiations. So... no ambassadors. Why? The Arabs want to give the terrorists safe passage out of the UK. And our government refuses? We trained him to be a killer. He's detached, professional. Drop of a hat, he'll pull the trigger. He's my choice. Isn't he up in court for a drunken street fight? Well, he works hard, plays harder, I'll give you that, boss. That's not my point. It's about leadership. Boss, this is the SAS. We're not philosophers, we're not warrior poets. We're the enforcers. Once we let these dogs off the leash, we know what they'll do. It won't be pretty. And when it comes time, we need someone up front with a heart of a lion... ...and the brains of a fucking judge. All right, Sergeant. But you'd better make sure he doesn't go off grid. Sir. - Max Vernon. - Where are the Arab ambassadors... ...we asked for? Why have you not brought them to us? And the bus. - Salim, there's a problem. - We can no longer wait for problems! The ambassadors, they... ...they're coming... ...but it may take some time. - Your army is going to attack us. - Nobody is going to attack you. We can hear them in the walls and outside. - Stop the noise. Do you hear? - Are we doing that? Consider it done. I want to speak to the BBC. The BBC? That I can do. - It may take a day or two to organize. - No! Now! Salim, you have to understand, the... ...this is a free country. I can't order the BBC to do anything. If you would release another hostage... ...it could help, believe me. Salim! Salim. Salim. [Don't say another day. ] [They need one more day, what can we do?] Come! You will come. You! You! - Sit down! - Come. One more day. Do you hear me, Mr. Max? Yes. There are others here who would not be so kind. Do you know of my country, Mr. Max? My people are tortured and oppressed by the Persians. Do you understand... ...what is at stake here for us? I'm trying to help you, Salim. Good. Because this is your last chance. After four days, as more deadlines pass... ...another hostage was released from the Iranian embassy today. Tensions are easing as hope grows ever stronger... ...for a peaceful solution. Do you think there could be a situation like the situation in Tehran... ...where the hostages are held for months? Well, that's all right, as far as we're concerned. We all have to agree to be gentlemen... ...but the sword of Damocles is hanging over everybody's head. The hostages are in a terrible state now. But even they do not know what the terrorists are saying. What are they saying? They are preparing to kill... ...all the hostages... ...if they do not get what they want. Right, the boss has approval for the deliberate action plan... ...to storm the embassy. When there's proof of murder, we're in. Stand by. Stand by. Go! Frame charge. Room clear. - Clear. - Go. You two clear that room there. Where's Jerry? Jerry, watch the stairs. X- RAYs may escape down. There will be shooting, so watch your arse. Tak, basement's that way. Mink, you head upstairs. Take control, all right? We can evacuate the hostages from up there. - Clear! - Any questions? If we do it 20 times faster, we just might save someone. Let's go again. Move it! Frame charge! This is a tricky one, Rusty. Maggie owes us a few fucking pints, that's for sure. Hey, Rusty, tell Maggie her gear's shit. Honestly, mate, I don't think she cares. No craftsman blames his tools, pal. - Who the fuck's this? - Caretaker. Knows the place inside out. Oh, it's all wrong. - What do you mean it's all wrong? - Here... it does not open this way. What? And this... the door is on the other side. Here, you will end up in a cupboard. Thank you. Let's get it changed, mate, quick as you can, please. Yeah? Yeah. Let's gear up. Let's go again. We'll rehearse it till we can do it in our fucking sleep. We need an ambassador there now! The Arab League refuses point blank... ...until there is the option of freedom for the terrorists. Can the Prime Minister be moved on this? - I'll ask. - The Iraqis are willing to help. I bet they are. Sami Mohammed Ali, Iraqi intelligence. Box 500 traced his movements to a boarding house in Earl's Court. Sami probably smuggled the weapons in diplomatic bags. Left for Iraq one day prior to the attack. Gentlemen... ...we are plainly on our own. - Hello. Salim? - Well? Your demands will be read out in full tonight... ...at 6 o'clock on the BBC. Do you promise this? I promise you. 6 o'clock. If not, I will kill a hostage... ...then one every half hour. Why don't you eat something, Trevor? You're not still thinking of using it? The gun? I might have to, Sim. Can't you feel it? Like animals to the slaughter. All we do is eat and sleep... ...but we know it's bad news in the end. Bravo Three in position. Good evening. This is the BBC News at 6 o'clock. Police released a statement today saying that the terrorists in the Iranian embassy... ...had requested a plane to take them out of the country. As yet there's no word from the government as to whether this demand will be met. We'll have more on the siege later in the program. But now for today's main news. Alex Higgins has been advised... Is that it? They're not reading it out. Stand by. They were meant to read it in full. Christ, they'll kill them. Hello. Mr. Max? Mr. Max? Yes, Salim, it's Max. Thank you for what you've done, Mr. Max. We are very happy. Very happy. Well, that's good to hear, Salim. They just read it out in full on the BBC World Service. We will release two hostages. Two hostage... After five long days, a further two hostages have been released... ...after the terrorists' demands were read out on the BBC World Service. The statement of the group holding the hostages... "The reason for us to come to Britain... "... to carry out this operation is because of the pressure... "... and oppression which is being practiced... "... by the Iranian government in Arabistan... "... and to convey our voice to the outside world... "... through your country. "Once again, we apologise to the people and the government... "... for this inconvenience. " The terrorists want freedom from repression... ...for the Arab-speaking part of Iran called Arabistan. There is now a growing sympathy for this oil-rich Arab-speaking state... ...ruled by the Persian-speaking Iranian majority. Syrian news reports repeated instances... Looks like we missed our chance, boys. What do you reckon? What do you reckon? Nothing. Doesn't change a thing. [You're murdering our brothers daily... ] [... I'll make an example of you. ] [Look at me!] Radio Tehran reports that an assault... ...is about to be made on the Iranian embassy at Princes Gate. While officials deny any such action... ...and insist negotiations are ongoing... ...the Iranian government itself is calling for the use of force. You've got that wrong. Bet you anything you like they'll give up now. I hope you're right, Jimmy. You. Come with me. Now. You'll go blind the amount you stare at those boards. Just figuring out who not to shoot, mate. Mate, this guy... ...Faisal Jaseem. Been in the army his whole life. I know this guy. You back this guy into a corner, he's going to fight his way out. Nothing to lose. I mean, it could be me, John. Apart from 'well educated'. Make sure you memorize all the faces, yeah? - Hello? - It's Constable Trevor Lock here. Trevor? What the hell is going on in there? They've got a hostage downstairs, sir. They've got him tied up down there. Unless they get what they want, they said they're gonna kill him. I really think they're gonna do it, sir. I really do. If we do not get what we want, we will kill him. Do you hear? I want a bus outside to take us to the airport now! Salim, calm down. Not 'calm down'! You have had long enough! - Where are the ambassadors? - I told you, we're working on it. No more delay. You bring the bus here now! [I'm talking to them right now, okay?] [Stop talking. ] [Khomeini kills our brothers at home... ] [... tortures them, his leader, Salim. ] [His leader. ] [While you sit up there, and talk. ] [Still want to talk?] [I welcome death if it leads to yours. ] [Don't do it, brother. ] Shots fired in the embassy. Get set. Salim? Salim? Yes? Was that one of the hostages? You have 30 minutes to meet all of our demands... ...or we will kill more. You can collect the body. - You ready? - Yep. I'm thinking that we should call the negotiators... ...get him to keep the leader, Salim, on the phone when we assault. We should steal as much time for these boys as we can. Aye, I'll tell the boss. And, Rusty? Check behind the doors, mate. The Prime Minister has authorized the military takeover. Do we think this man was killed accidentally? No, we do not. Colonel? I'd like the record to show you signed over control to the regiment. Maggie's government's hanging by their tits... ...and it's Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin who's got a hold of them. Just don't shoot the fucking hostages, John. - Are we on? - Yeah. I need a drink. The Prime Minister asks that there be no smokescreen... ...to cover or block the assault from the television cameras. Colonel Rose? She wants the world and the British people... ...to see how this government deals with terrorism. All stations. This is Sunray. I have control. I say again, I have control. Max. I had a call from Whitehall. You gave the SAS time to plan. They're very grateful. This is a request from their colonel. Keep Salim talking during the assault. If they haven't got their leader, it might help. What are you saying, sir? You want me to help kill them? Oh, no. I want you to save the hostages. What am I supposed to offer them? The world now, for all we care. I've got a nice shot of heads. Let's move. What is it? - Salim, it's Max Vernon. - What is it, Mr. Max? Do you have anything for me or do we have to kill another and another? I've been authorized to discuss buses with you... ...and get you to Heathrow Airport. The government has accepted your terms. The ambassadors are on their way. - We are arranging buses now. - You are lying. No more lies. No more lies. I'm not lying to you, Salim. One bus. Enough for all of us. One bus. All right. - How is it? - It's a lot better, I'll tell you that much. - Look at this as an overview. - That's great. Distraction charge is in. It must have curtains. Good. Yes. We can do that. And I want you to drive, Mr. Max. Mr. Max. Here. Here, Mr. Max. Here. Here. Hello? Advance to wait. I say again... all teams advance to wait. PC Trevor Lock, sir. Trevor, put Salim back on immediately, please. Sir, we're all very concerned in here, sir. Please assure me there is not an assault about to happen. Shit. Oh, shit. Bravo One, rear team in position. Trevor, I can assure you 100%... ...we are not about to attack. We are genuinely arranging for their demands to be met. Frame charge going in. Just can't believe after all this... - ... the promises you're making. - Trevor, listen carefully to me. I have my instructions from the government. Those instructions are to keep the hostages alive. Do you understand? - Sir. - Good. Now put Salim back on, please. Put him down, boys. We're gonna let off the charge. Yes, Mr. Max? Salim, we need to know where you want to fly to. I can make arrangements immediately for the jet. It needs to be of a certain size... ...a certain fuel capacity. I heard something suspicious. - There's nothing suspicious. - There is a... a suspicious sound. There's nothing, Salim. Talk to me. - No, wait! I will come back. - Salim, wait. Go! Go! Go! - Keep filming. - Where the hell are you going? Bravo One, where is the frame charge on the ground floor? If we blow it, we're gonna fucking kill him! Are we live, Bill? Cutting in... now! At the Iranian embassy at Princes Gate... ...an explosion has sounded from the rear of the building... ...as police and press nearby are being told to take cover. Now two black-clad men can be seen on the front balcony. They are placing an object of some kind in front of the embassy window... ...and climbing back over the balcony to their side. A second explosion has ripped through the front of the embassy. All right! Go on! Fucking cut him down! Bravo One, where is the frame charge on the ground floor? We're changing the fucking plan. What was that? - If we set off the charge, it'll kill him. - What the hell is going on? Rusty! Forget it, boss. He ain't talking to no one now. Cut the rope! Smash it in! Flash bang! - I'm all right! I'm all right! - Get in there! - Clear! - Clear! Smoke covers it, obscuring everything. Jesus Christ. On your fucking feet, Sim! Out! Out! Now! Go in. Watch yourself, Mink. - Clear. - Stairs clear. Come on, boys. Let's go. Locked door. - Four female hostages. - Four female hostages! We have four female hostages. Stairs are clear. Send them. Go. - Door's jammed. - Right! I'll go round! Clear. Basement... clear. Fuck! Fuck! Go, go, go. Keep them moving, John. We need to clear this floor. Go! - Go! Go! Go! Go! - Get up! Get up! - Go! Go! - Come on! You all right, Trevor. You're all right. Hostage PC Trevor Lock appears at a window. He's waving his police hat as identification. Police shout at him, and he draws back inside. Police dogs howl. A woman relative of one of the hostages can be heard screaming. Helicopters can be heard... - Clear! Get them out! - Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! - Hurry up! Fucking hurry up! - Let's go! Send them down to me! Eyes forward! Move! Move! Move! Keep moving! - Get down! Get down! - Get down! Stay down! Stay down! Don't move! Don't move! Anybody! Anybody! - We've got a room full of hostages. - Stay down! Keep your fucking heads down! Okay, lads, let's bring them out right now, yeah? - Okay. Get out. - Stop moving! To the door! Let's go! - Out! - Fuck! Get moving! Go on, move it! Move it! Fucking move! Go! - Let's go! Let's go! Get up now! - There are still two X-RAYs missing. Move! Trevor! Get down, I said! Move! Go! Move! Move! Come on! Come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! He's got a grenade! Stay there! The pin's in! All right! Let's bring them out! Let's bring them out right now! Come on! Stay down! Let's go! Let's go! Get out! Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on! Out! Out! Come on! That's an X-RAY, boys. The boys all made it. They all made it, boss. Only one hostage killed. It's a miracle. After six days... ...and almost 11 hours exactly... ...the siege at number 16 Princes Gate is over. - Did you see him come down those stairs? - I fucking did, man. He was a cheeky bastard, wasn't he? For the inquiry. Oh, wait. Wait, wait. One sec. Hello? Max? Is that you, love? Yeah. Thank God! I just saw it now. Are you hurt? Max, please. Will you say something? I'm all right, love. I'm sorry. Just didn't want you to worry. You know, in case you heard anything on the news. I regret that it proved necessary to resort to the use of force. But there was in the end no alternative.
