Birdy, I'm here! Uncle Deer. Uncle Deer. Birdy, what's the matter? Uncle Deer. The wolves have come! Hurry home! Okay. Come on, hurry home! Yes. Go find Sika Deer. Ask him to come home at once! Yes. Sika Deer, Sika Deer. Sika Deer. Stop it! Sika Deer. Sika Deer, Sika Deer. Sika Deer, stop fighting. Sika Deer, Sika Deer. Stop it! Sika Deer. Lamb. Go get Grandpa Goat. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa Goat. Baaaa... Grandpa Goat. Grandpa Goat. Leave me alone. I want to ask you... what you think of my dance. Very good. Bahh! And tell me... Who is prettier, me or Miss Deer? Of course you're prettier. Really? Miss Deer is pretty too. Which of us is prettier? Tell me. You said you're pretty. She said she's pretty. And you? In my opinion, you're both pretty. Damn! You two-faced man. I know everyone thinks Miss Deer is prettier. Something is bound to go wrong. What is bound to go wrong? She sees Elk today and Sika Deer the next. One day, they'll fight for her. They're jealous of each other. Grandpa, disaster! What happened? Sika Deer and Elk are fighting. Fighting? Come on! See, I was right. None of your business. Wolf, let it go! You too! Sika Deer. No, Sika Deer! No! Stop fighting. Why hasn't Grandpa Goat come yet? Sika Deer. Over there. No! Sika Deer! Stop. Why are you fighting? Answer me! Stop it! My dear Grandpa Goat. Are you playing dumb? Or you're really a fool? Or you're going senile? Didn't I tell you? Sika Deer and Elk are fighting for Miss Deer. They're fighting over her love. You shut up. Miss Deer, which one do you love? Tell me. Hurry! If I were you, I'd love whoever is braver. I suggest that they have a duel. Duel? Let Grandpa Goat be the referee. She'll love whoever wins the duel. Foxy, stop provoking hate. It's only natural. The victor in the battlefield is also the victor in love. Elk, go fight him. Fight to death! Sika Deer. Stop! Sika Deer, no! Let go of him! Sika Deer. -Let go of him! -Sika Deer. Listen! Let go of him! Sika Deer! Sika Deer! Sika Deer! Go! Go! Sika Deer! Sika Deer! Sika Deer, something happened in your home. Your father asked you to go back. Really? Yes. Sika Deer. You're going home? Something happened to my family. I'll be back soon. Off you go! I'll take care of Miss Deer. Thank you, Grandpa Goat. Sika Deer. Miss Deer. Let's go home together. What happened to his family? I'm sure it's nothing serious. He'll be back soon. Monkey, Big Cat. -You escort Miss Deer home. -Yes. Ugh! Who cares? Elk. I'll introduce you someone prettier than Miss Deer. Grandpa Goat didn't help you at all. Everyone was in favor of Sika Deer. Sika Deer, you better watch out! Yeah. Try us if you dare! -Here you are... -Dad. He's gone... The Bloody Wolf. Son, you must promise me you'll avenge my death. Father! Revenge! I'll seek revenge! There's nothing to eat in this mountain. We should try other places. Let's split up and find somewhere else. Okay, let's go! Let the others know when you find it. Got it? Yes. Go! This way. Sika Deer. Why aren't you back yet? Father, please protect me from Heaven. I'll capture the Bloody Wolf alive. Miss Deer, please forgive me. Before I take revenge, I can't see you. Ah... Remember when our young love blossomed in the garden in spring, we revealed our true feelings. Oh dear... How refreshing was the breeze. Ah... Remember when love made us crazy on the riverbank in the summer heat, our romance was sweet as honey. Oh dear... We heard the love poems that the water was singing. Ah... Remember when our love went through hardship in autumn, we stood on the hill and tasted our bitter tears. Alas. And the moonlight felt dreary. Ah... Remember when we bid farewell on the wharf in winter, We agreed to split. Alas. And the waves wept from night till morning. Sika Deer is away. Seize this great opportunity. Off you go, quick! Go! Go! Go! The annoying Grandpa Goat is here again. Come on. Let's go! Miss Deer. Grandpa Goat. It's getting dark and you're not home? I'm worried about you, so I come to see you. I'm looking after you for Sika Deer. When will Sika Deer be back? Why didn't he ask Birdy to bring me a letter? He is busy tonight. Shall I send Lamb to keep you company? It's okay. Grandpa Goat. Please go home and rest. I'll come see you again tomorrow. Okay, I'm off. Elk! Just let it go and cheer up. Let me take you out and play, okay? Get lost! I hate your stinky smell. That's what a fox smells like! I can tell that you're still thinking about Miss Deer. If you really like her, I've got an idea. What idea? I'm not telling you. Please tell me, please... If you despise my smell, just stay away from me. Foxy. I'm sorry for my rude remark. Please tell me what I can do. Now you're begging me... Tell me, quick! Thanks! Go, hurry up! I'll meet you later. Miss Deer. Though I couldn't beat Sika Deer, my admiration for you remains the same. You mean... I envy Sika Deer that he has won your heart. He's a truly lucky fellow. I believe a more beautiful girl is waiting for you. But I won't change. I've vowed to myself that apart from you, I won't love anyone else. In this case, I'm very sorry. Has Sika Deer come back? Not yet. When he's back, please give him my greetings. I wish you very happy together. Thank you. Elk. Elk. Foxy is calling me. I'm here! Sorry. I don't want to see Foxy. Miss Deer. Elk. Here you are! I've been looking for you! What do you want from me? What do you want from me? I want to tell you a secret. I want to tell you a secret. You should keep it from Miss Deer. My lips are sealed. Sika Deer is dead. Who told you that? I didn't know you were in the cave. Damn! Damn it! How did he die? Please tell me. Everyone has heard about it. They were just afraid to tell you. Since you're already dead, what's the point of me living? Miss Deer, Miss Deer. What are you doing? Since Sika Deer is dead, I don't want to live anymore. What? You want to kill yourself! Only human beings kill themselves. We're animals. Please don't follow their example. Let go of me! Let me die! Miss Deer. Dear Miss Deer, My father and brothers were killed. I must seek revenge. I won't be able to see you until I've taken revenge. So you colluded with one another to trick me! Go away! Miss Deer. What happened? Grandpa Goat. Grandpa Goat. They tricked me into believing that Sika Deer is dead. It's your fault! Now Grandpa Goat is here. What should we do? Elk, it's you again! Not me! Not me! Not me! Foxy, you plan on this, right? I heard it from others. From whom? Tell me! If you don't tell me, I'll chase you off the forest! Get out! Say it! Say it or not? Please don't be like this. -Hit her. -Don't be like this. Elk! Elk! Elk! Elk! Foxy! I'm here. Here you are! I've been looking for you! What do you want from me? It's all your fault that I got bullied by Grandpa Goat. I don't mind being bullied. But he also looks down on you. Really? Is it true? If I were you, I'd win Miss Deer over by force. By force? Yes, by force. I've been to Grandpa Goat's place a few times. But I didn't have the chance. You can trick her into coming here. It's a secretive spot. No one will know about it. Miss Deer will succumb to force. We must be tough with her this time. Yeah. No! No! Miss Deer will never come to this place. Leave it to me. You just wait here. Okay, please. Miss Deer. -Miss Deer! -It's you again. Miss Deer. Don't get mad. I came to apologize. Apologize? It wasn't my idea at all. Then who asked you to lie? It was Elk. He kept begging me. He said you were in love with him but Sika Deer came between you. I had no choice but to lie. It's the only mistake I made in my life. I truly regret it. I deserve to be punished. Foxy, please don't be like this. It's all right. Then have you forgiven me? Yes, I've forgiven you. That's good. We're gonna be best friends. It's so boring in the cave. Let's take a walk, shall we? Let's go. No, I don't want to. Come on, let's go! No! Ready? Yes. Grandpa, do you want a peach or plum? I want a peach. Here you are! Grandpa Goat, quick! Got you! It's your turn. No! Disaster! Follow me, everyone. Let me pick some flowers for you. Don't leave me here. I don't want flowers. Foxy. Elk. Miss Deer. Miss Deer. Come with me. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Miss Deer. Help! Help! Help! Elk. You want to rebel against me? Grandpa Goat. What happened? Why did you come here? Foxy led me here. Foxy again! Where is she? Here! I've got her! Go! Damn! Wanna escape? What's your defense this time? I know nothing. Did you trick Miss Deer into coming here.? I did ask her out. But I didn't know Elk would come here. Monkey, tell us. She asked Elk to wait here, and she'd lead Miss Dear to this place. Monkey, you're lying! I heard you up in the tree. What can you say? I did trick her. So what? Get out! You're banished from this forest. Out! Get out! Out! Grandpa Goat, please don't... Get out! Sika Deer. Have you found Bloody Wolf? No. Why don't you go visit Miss Deer? I won't see her until I slay Bloody Wolf. Master Wolf, please spare my life! You know I'm hungry, right? Master Wolf. If you spare my life, I'll take you to a place to eat something delicious. Really? You're not lying? Master Wolf, I dare not lie to you. There are rabbits, goats, and bucklings. I'll take you to eat them. If you lie to me, you know I'll eat you alive! No. How dare I lie to you? Okay, lead the way! Go! Go! Hey, hey, Bro Tortoise No one moves as slowly as you You drag along from dawn to dusk. You can't escape when the big bad wolves come. Hey, hey, Bro Rabbit Don't laugh at my slow pace Endurance is the key Let's race from here to the end of the hill And see who will get there first Bro Tortoise, you're so funny How dare you race with me when I'm much faster. It's great to run on the plain. I'll reach the end in a second. Seeing him drag behind, I'd take a nap first. Poor, poor Rabbit. Now you know I'm not afraid of the steep road. I climb it hard. I win the final victory. You're not even aware of it. Please shed your arrogance and stop laughing at me. Thank you, Miss Deer, for saving me. I will... You're welcome. For our safety, the entrance to the woods must be guarded. Who will guard it tonight? Who? Lamb, you go. Grandpa, I'm afraid. Afraid of what? You're my grandson. For everyone's safety, I send you there. Go to the entrance to the woods. When you see Bloody Wolf, blow the whistle and we'll come to you. Grandpa. Go! You said there would be delicious things. But there was only a rabbit. Master Wolf, it's still early. Go take a nap. I'll get the yummy food ready. Tell you what. Buckling meat is very delicious. Swallow! Swallow! Swallow! What's up, Grandpa Goat? Go find Sika Deer. Tell him the Bloody Wolf is here. Only he can deal with the Wolf. Go, quick! Okay, I'm off! Let's wait under the big tree. If we hear the siren, we'll know the Wolf is here. We'll work together and kill the Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Where is the Wolf? It's not here. Why did you lie? I was afraid it'd be too late if the Wolf really came. Stop messing around! You're all fooled by me. You should never lie again. Let's go. I'm hungry. I'm really hungry! Okay...okay. I...I'll take you to a buckling. Wolf... Wolf... Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Lamb is lying again! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Master Wolf, we should leave! Go, quick! Bloody Wolf! Don't move! Wait! -They asked you to help. -Is it true? Rabbit has been eaten by the Wolf. No wonder I couldn't find him. Go, let's go take revenge! Lamb! Lamb! Grandpa Goat. Look! My dear Lamb! It's a nightmare! Lamb has been eaten by the Wolf! Lamb! Lamb... Grandpa Goat. We're sorry for your loss. Grandpa Goat. Look! Elk, what happened to you? Elk. Grandpa Goat. I saw the Wolf was eating Lamb. I tried to save him but got beaten by the Wolf. Grandpa Goat. I really tried my best... I don't blame you. Lamb was naughty. He told lies. Grandpa Goat. Now I've come to realize Foxy is truly evil. She brought the Wolf here. She brought him here? She was going to let the Wolf... eat you alive, Grandpa Goat. Eat me? Where is Foxy? I'll fight her to death! She tried to suck up to the Wolf and led him here at night They hide in the woods during the day and have fun together. Have fun? Damn! Shameless! Shameless! Foxy, you ingratiate yourself with the Wolf. The Wolf is cruel and heartless. You'll regret it one day. You even brought him to eat me. I'm not afraid! She's jealous of Miss Deer. I'm really worried. We need someone to protect her. I'll volunteer! You... Grandpa Goat, please don't worry. I won't be rude to her again. What happened before was Foxy's fault. She provoked me to do that. I'm glad you repent your mistakes But Miss Deer doesn't trust you. Go to the cave and protect her in secret. Don't let her know about it. Yes, I got it. Grandpa Goat, I'm off! Monkey, Big Cat. Let's go back and get ready for fighting the Wolf. We'll seek revenge for Lamb's death. Did you tell everyone to leave the forest? Yes, everyone has split up. Let's find a safe spot to hide, quick! It's dark. Big Cat, you lead the way. Achoo! Tell me. Now! Where is Grandpa Goat? Go find him! He used to be here all the time. How dare you lie to me! No! I dare not lie to you. Where is Grandpa Goat? I think he'll definitely be here tomorrow night. If we can't find Grandpa Goat tonight, I'll eat you alive! Master Wolf, please spare my life. Please spare my life. Damn! Bloody Wolf, your time has come! Follow him quickly. Don't worry about me. Follow Sika Deer. Go get the Wolf! Go! Hurry! Elk. Elk. You haven't given up on Miss Deer? Sika Deer, what do you want? Miss Deer. Don't be afraid. Please, I'm begging you. Please save my life. So you're an injured wolf. Yes, a poor wolf. How did you get hurt? I was tricked by a fox. Foxy? I was beaten by a deer. Is it Elk? Yes, he has big antlers. Miss Deer. They're after me. Please... Please let me hide in your cave, okay? Okay. Hide in this basket. After they run past us, I'll dress your wound. Please. Hurry! Miss Dear, please. Take me up to the mountain, please... Okay, I'll take you up there. I was also a victim... of the hideous Foxy and Elk, I'll ask Grandpa Goat to help you. Yes, please. Why did you take it off? I can't stand it. I feel terrible. Please take me to hide in the mountain. You're badly injured. Let me dress your wound first. I'll lead you through the back trail, so Elk won't catch you. Please, please. Stop it! Stop fighting! The enemy is coming. We must work together to fight against Bloody Wolf. We must be united. You're stubborn! Let go of him! I asked him to protect Miss Deer. Got it? Elk... I misunderstood you. Please forgive me. Sika Deer. Miss Deer really wants to see you. Go see her. Yes. Miss Deer isn't here. Miss Deer. Miss Deer, Miss Deer... Blood? There is blood here. She must be tricked to go up to the mountain. Let's go save Miss Deer. Let's split up! You go that way Elk, you go this way. Yes. Miss Deer. If you want to save me, do your best. I...I'm very hungry. We're in the middle of nowhere. How can I get you any food? There is something right here... What? It's...you, Miss Deer. You want to eat me? Your flesh is sweet. I'm very hungry. Let me eat you. Let me eat you, please? You! You're such an ingrate! Can you wait a moment before eating me? Why? I saved you. And you want to eat me. How could you? We should consult the elderly to see if they agree. Okay. There is a big old tree. Let's ask him. Come on! Wait. Come on! Go ask it. Grandpa Tree. Please be our judge. I saved the Wolf's life. But now he wants to eat me. Should he do so? Answer her! Say it! Haa...Haa... (There is no justice in this world!) Old trees like me can live up to thousands years old. People take shelter in our shades, but when our leaves have fallen, and our branches dried up, they chop us up for firewood. There is no justice in this world. In this case, I should let the Wolf eat me? Yes, let him eat you. Why shouldn't he? Miss Deer. What's your defense this time? No, trees can not move. They're different from us. His words don't count. I want to find one of our own. An elderly to be the judge. Okay, I agree. Go! Shall we ask Old Buffalo? Fine, go ask him. Uncle Buffalo. Uncle Buffalo. Old Buffalo! Are you calling me? Yes! Uncle Buffalo. Can you speak up? Uncle Buffalo. Let me ask you one thing. I saved the Wolf's life. But now he tries to eat me. Well, let him eat you then. How can you say that? You saved his life. I saved his life. He should repay my kindness, right? Repay your kindness? I tilled rice fields for men all my life. When I get old, they'll kill and eat me anyway. So why should he repay your kindness? That's right! What? No more excuses? You're speechless, right? No. Twice isn't enough. We have to ask three times. Let's ask someone again. What if you lose again? I'll let you eat me then. Fine, let's go. I was so terrified by the Wolf... that I said something unfair. I deserve to be punished! Let's ask Goose Fairy, okay? No matter whom you ask, I'll eat you anyway. Goose Fairy, I'd like to ask you a question. Yes, Miss Deer? In this world, should we repay others' kindness or kill someone who is kind to you? We should definitely repay the kindness. But now this wolf whom I saved is trying to kill me. How can he do that? You know nothing! She did save me but she nearly suffocated me. So you want to eat her? If she wants to save me, she should do her best. Now I'm hungry. Her flesh is sweet and soft. Listen to him, Goose Fairy! Can there be something so unreasonable in the world? Unreasonable? I don't believe Miss Deer could put you in such a small basket. Of course she could! She tried to kill me on purpose. How could you be put in such a small basket? I don't believe you. Why not? If you don't, I'll show you right now. You don't believe? I am not lying. You'll see right now! You don't believe? Like this. Put it over my head like this. How dare you set me up! I'll surely skin you alive and eat you! There's nowhere to hide. Stop running! Damn! Goose Fairy, we can't beat him. You can fly. Go to Grandpa Goat and Sika Deer and ask them to rescue me! Go, quick! Stop running! Elk! Elk. Go rescue Miss Deer on the mountain. Elk. Go rescue Miss Deer on the mountain. Go, quick! Let's go! Over there! They're here! Don't you come closer! If you do, I'll strangle her at once. Isn't that Bloody Wolf? Bloody Wolf, here we are! Let's go! You go down and I'll get up there. Okay, go! Don't worry about me. Go help Sika Deer fight against Bloody Wolf... and save Miss Deer! Miss Deer, watch out! Damn! Miss Deer has fallen off the cliff! You must save her! Grandpa Goat. Please tell Miss Deer on my behalf that I'm very sorry. I feel very guilty. I give her and Sika Deer my blessings. and wish them happy I...I... Elk! Elk! Elk... Elk! Elk! Go and tie the Wolf up! I'm going to save Miss Deer. Miss Deer! Miss Deer! Help! Father. Today, right before you, I'll avenge your death by killing the beast! Bloody Wolf, you've slaughtered so many of us. Today, your time has come! Sika Deer. Miss Deer. (The End)
