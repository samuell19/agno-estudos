The door isn't just latched, it's blocked by a chair! It's that Sandhu's son from next door. He's been terrace-hopping for a year! Making fools of us! But not today! But, child... ...she told me she'd be practicing her dance routine. Or maybe the door is swollen! Yeah right! No rain, nor sleet. So how did the door swell up? Because it's old and worn out. Call.. - No one is calling anyone! You better move aside! Today, I'm going to catch them red-handed. Move aside both of you! Rumi! What are you doing? One Two. You... Stop, you...! Wait... There you go! Didn't I tell you? This peacock sneaks in every day! "Save yourself." "Escape now." "You heartthrob." "Watch out." Your t-shirt is inside-out. "Listen." "Do as it is said." "Do as it is said." "This youth.." "..is to be blamed." Hey, mom! Did you hear? That girl next door girl, eloped with her boyfriend... ...and had a love-marriage! But then, within a month... ...he dumped her for another girl! There's no guarantee of love in love-marriages. I should leave now. But we guarantee love in arranged-marriages! Leave like a gentleman.

They are the only weirdos here. That peacock! And our Red Fairy! Who'll want to marry into a dishonored family? I have a daughter too! Kimmy! Calm down. She also made her quit hockey. She'd be playing Nationals by now. I had to pull this information out of Kiran ... ...that she ran away from the national camp with him. Enough! It's time to get her married. Alright. Let's call the wedding agent. To find Rumi an alliance. I'm only going to marry Vicky! I won't even offer a cup of tea to anyone else. He isn't interested in marrying you. If he was, he wouldn't come through the terrace! What else can he do! You're always guarding the door. Even a cat can't sneak inside, let alone a human! Shut up for a minute! Will his family come with a marriage proposal for you? And if he doesn't ... ...then the wedding agent will find you a groom.

Of course! Who else? Tomorrow? Yeah. What's up? But dad might be ... That's alright. Bring your mom then. You can jump over terraces for 'Fyaar'. You can take a beating for it. But you can't ask for my hand in marriage?! But, Rumi! This is so sudden - Yeah, it's sudden I've given my word that you'll come with a proposal. And that if you don't turn up ... ...I'll marry the first idiot they choose for me! What! You know I've never gone back on my word. Now you decide. And listen! Call me only if you're coming tomorrow! If not ... delete my number! Hey... Yonex is a brand for racquets. Jonex is a brand for hockey sticks. Don't mix "Y" with "J"! J for Jalandar. And the best brand for hockey is '"Rakshak"'.

I've just started as a DJ.. - You don't need time when you're aroused. You fire your gun in under a minute. You should join the army! Atleast you'll be useful to the country! Get lost! - What is this nonsense? You know I love you! If you did, you'd come home to talk. But we never wanted marriage! But I have to now! You can't decide for both of us! That's why ...I'm not holding you at gunpoint! I was confident of your love, is why I gave my word... ...that you'll marry me. If we hadn't been caught, I wouldn't have insisted. But we did get caught. That's why I need you to bail me out! Before I get a life-sentence with someone else. I don't get it! You never get it. Dumb idiot! You're being unfair to me!

We'll take all the time in the world... ...and shortlist a dozen prospective brides. I don't need a dozen. One is enough. If you didn't want choices then why ask us to arrange it?! Even your dad had shortlisted about ten before he chose me! The girl should feel like the "chosen one". Don't worry. Arranged marriages, these days ... ... are quite modern. Once the proposal is confirmed... ... the society allows them to watch adult films together. Okay! Let's settle. We'll shortlist around 4-5 girls? Haven't met a single girl, yet ... ... and you've already started your soap opera. What soap opera? You don't get into this! Please put those dumbbells aside? She'll seem like a wrestler! Even you!

I don't know, mummy. I'll tell you. I'm getting engaged tomorrow. Either sit tight at home or leave town! I don't want to see your ugly face again. Here, your shawl. He stole it to gift it to me! It's dry cleaned. Will someone tell me what's going on? Aunty, your son has lost it. You get lost. - Why should I? I'll tell you. She's marrying someone else... ...because your boy won't grow up. Uncle, he can't even make up his mind. Why can't he just talk to her family? She's ready to wait for him... ...as long as he commits. Uncle, tell me... She's not asking him to marry right away... ...at least get engaged! So that her family isn't shamed. Vicky, the girl was right. If you can't sit tight, leave town. Let's invite... ...only close friends and family. Robbie wants a small wedding. Limited guests. I disagree. A wedding should be big. Yes, indeed. It's no fun... ...if it's not a grand reception! For you I left the world behind, We'll chill there, bro. "I've chosen you. - Party hard. "I've chosen you. "I've chosen you. I tried to to stop myself, But my heart's made up its mind Dude, what happened? Why are you turning back towards the city? Don't go to her. Get down! Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds Crying out for you, My screams echo through time I feel dead even when I'm alive Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds Keep Rumi away from him. What happened? Get lost! I need to talk to Rumi. She won't meet you. Just leave! I feel dead even when I'm alive Do you want me to kick you out? You can do whatever you want. I won't leave. Unless Rumi comes and talks to me... I'll stand here in protest. Twisting and turning hour after hour Oh, why do we doubt this love of ours, Twisting and turning hour after hour Twisting and turning hour after hour You are my spirit, You are my being Come back. You are my spirit, You are my being You are everything. Yet you forget me, almost like I'm nothing Yet you forget me, almost like I'm nothing Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds He's been standing there all day. What is he trying to prove? Crying out for you, My screams echo through time I feel dead even when I'm alive Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds She's locked herself in. Get rid of this trouble. People will talk. Rumi! Listen. What do you want? Leave. - I want to marry you! I'm engaged and getting married tomorrow. Now get lost! I know that. But you aren't married yet. And you think I'll call it off for you? I don't like your face anymore. Leave! - I know you love me. Then you're delusional. I know I made a mistake but I'll make it up to you. Rumi, our love - Screw love. Stop this nonsense and listen. Whether you like it or not... I know how to get love and make love! I'll fix everything. Please forgive me! You think I'm here... ...to keep forgiving you. Think, before you marry someone else. Just leave! Stop pushing. I'm leaving alright. You're treating me like a beggar. That's exactly what you are! And a thief too! Even your haircut is a copy! Why are you always insulting me? Beggar or thief, we're meant to be. Out! Rumi, ... we have but, one life! I'm here to marry you! I'll do anything. I'd die for you. Are you dumb? It's too late. I've moved on. Get out. Let's run away! Is this a joke for you? We eloped once, right? What happened then? Look around! Everything is set. Guests, food, stage ... everything! DJ Sandzz, bring your music... ... and dance at my wedding! When you're crying alone after your wedding... ...call the caterers, the decorators to cry on their shoulders! Tell them "I got married because your arrangements were done... ...now come wipe my tears." Fine. I will! When you wanted to elope... ... I came without thinking twice! This time, I'm asking. You can count on me now. I can't live without you! Die then! He has realized his mistakes. So... ...you'll run away? I don't know anymore... ...but I don't want to lose him. Whatever I decide today... ... will become the rest of my life. And what about grandpa? And family? - I know they'll be upset. They won't talk to me. Are you even listening to yourself? Whatever you're planning ... ... it's just wrong, Rumi! It's selfish! I don't understand what kind of love is this. It's the kind of love where ... ..its never enough! And what about the groom... ...who's expecting you there tomorrow? He'll find someone better. But does he deserve to find out at the altar... ...that God has someone better planned for him? Right. You run away. That's fine. Bro! If mom... ...catches her daughter-in-law, at this hour... ... there's going to be drama! I wanted to talk to you! Yeah, sure. Wanna come in. I ... I don't want to get married. What? I can't come to the Gurudwara tomorrow. Is tomorrow a problem? No. I mean I don't want to get married. He's screwed. I thought I'd let you know so you don't wait for me. I don't suit you anyway. You deserve someone better! That's all! I'll leave now. Are you on facebook? I'll add you! Can you please help me kickstart the bike? She walks like fire, blazing funeral pyre World's on mute but she's an amplifier Tined tongue talks smack ! Never spares a needed whack Carries a mean stick Mind your words or feel the sick burn She'll brass hard on your manhood, Dare belittle, any sister from the hood. Watch out ! She roars like a lioness Pride in her gait, Shine on her face, Foxy mind, shrewd in her trait, A fiery gaze Now move to the side She's not your Jekyll, She's Mr. Hyde. Do you defy? She'll eat you alive... She is chaos Go ahead and try. She's not your Jekyll, She's Mr. Hyde. "Try and say." "Try and crate.." "..the uproar." "Try and do it." This month's.. ..30th is final. Excuse me. Tell me, Mr. Robbie. This guy... This DJ... - Sandhu's son? If his name is Sandhu, then he's obviously Sandhu's son! What does he do? - Nothing much ... Earns a little money as a DJ. What kind of life can he offer Rumi? His love won't pay the bills or rent! Did Rumi say something? She's changed her mind? You can't reason with those two! Rumi is especially difficult! Rumi might be difficult. The guy might be too. But the boy's parents... ...might be easy to talk to? They must be practical. What should I tell them? Are you mad? You'll take her away on her wedding day? It's my mistake that I didn't do this earlier. No son, that wasn't a mistake. When you paid your way into engineering college ... ...that was a mistake. Then one day, on Facebook... ...you saw your banker friend's lifestyle. So you decided to pursue the same. And I paid for it. That was a mistake. And then you went and got your hair cut. Defying our religion... Thinks he'll become a DJ... ...by changing his name from Sandhu to Sandzz! You've never understood the difference ... ...between wanting and doing. You don't value anything... ...because I gave it to you on a platter. This time I'm doing something! Yeah, I can see that! Eloping with a bride on her wedding day. Very responsible! Good job, son! Running away is easy... ...but building a home is tough!. Why are you ruining her life? Papa, I... I can't live without Rumi! Really? Then you should have done this before! Now she's marrying someone else ... ...so you've woken up. If you respected her... ...she wouldn't be pleading with us yesterday. You don't want to marry her. You just want to own her... ... like all your other toys. You cried for this yo-yo. Threw it away, when you couldn't figure it out. One day you wanted to be a boxer ... The next day, a cricketer! Son, you can never make up your mind. Please spare Rumi! She's not your toy. I will meet you yet again. Perhaps as a figment of your imagination. spreading myself A mysterious line, on your canvas, I will keep gazing at you. I will meet you yet again. How and where? I know not. I will meet you yet again. So welcome Mr. and Mrs. Bhatia. Enjoy your stay with us. Thank you. Hello. One stuffed bread. With butter. Send extra curry. Why don't you make yourself... Compliment from the house, sir. Thanks very much. Thank you. That's kind of you. Ummm... Left or right? Always right. In order to get in the pack... ...it's important to win... The mating sessions are short, but frequent. Sometimes over 50 times, a day. Now Prince and Ziggy have begun to court each other. Another male lion coyly approaches the female. On our first night, I told him clearly... ...if you want some action, then take me to Switzerland. Or else sleep on the couch. You're lucky your husband isn't like mine. If I give him that option... ...he'd definitely sleep on the couch! Don't start again. Breakfast? - Get some bread. With butter? Are you okay, child? I'm not sure. Haven't gotten over one relationship, and I'm already in another. Hey... Take the bags from him! Robbie is a strong man. Yes. Rumi's here. She seems nervous. Great. Drive slowly. It's raining. Go quickly. She got into the backseat! Does she think my son is her driver? Come, sit up front? Drive safe. At obscure crossroads, fate stands Blankly, those eyes staring at me. A half-hearted life, solemnly hangs As estranged happinesses flee Flames of our eternal love Flames of our eternal love Doused in an instant ! Flames of our eternal love Flames of our eternal love Doused in an instant ! On bended knees and bowed head I pray to you in god's stead Miles that separate us This damaged faith This remorse and regret Everything said with words inefficient Flames of our eternal love Flames of our eternal love Doused in an instant ! Flames of our eternal love Flames of our eternal love Doused in an instant ! Our bereft lives have halted as our faintest hope died. Like crimson flowers Nectarless inside A windfall of woe Forsaken and alone We could've been Us, but you nestled too distant. Flames of our eternal love Flames of our eternal love Doused in an instant ! Flames of our eternal love Flames of our eternal love Doused in an instant ! My aunt gifted it... ...for our first night. Are you sure? Waiting for a call? No. Kashmiri tea, sir? Tea? No. Sugar and.. What else? Ohhh... Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhh... You think you can mess with me? Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhh... Sorry! I go overboard sometimes. With what? My sense of humor. This is your sense of humor? Yeah! What do you do in anger then? Hello. Hello, mom. How's the honeymoon? It's going well. Having fun? Yeah, it's fun. Here, talk to papa. Okay. Robbie. Hi, papa! How's the honeymoon? It's going well. Having fun? Yes, it's quite fun! Good! Here, talk to Rumi's aunt. Rumi's here. I'll pass the phone. Your aunt wants to talk. Yes, aunty! - Rumi. How's the honeymoon? Honeymoon's going good! Having fun? No. Not so much! Actually, he forgot to get condoms. By the time he bought.. Hello. There's some network issue! I have network here. I can hear you just fine! Hello. What a ridiculous question! "How's the honeymoon?" Have I ever asked them about their honeymoon? Say hi to my friend! Who's that? She's my friend. Say hi to my girlfriend. Tell her how many times we had fyaar! Vicky, that's personal! But wasn't it great? Was what great? - Our fyaar! Will she hate me now? That's the only way she'll move on. Are you crazy? I don't want her to hate me! You want her to move on. But you don't want her to hate you. Why don't you ever question me? How was your run? I didn't go for a run. Okay. I'm not a virgin. Maybe you were expecting one. Most Indian men come back so they can marry virgins. I'm not one either. Don't you want to know who it was? Are you okay? Can we go back? I'm done with this place. It rains all day anyway. Hmmm. Dear Lord! Who is it? What... Came back so soon? Greetings! Take the keys. Bless you! Is she alright? Is everything okay? Some tea? They got back from their honeymoon so early. The reservation was for two weeks. They left halfway. Why don't you two go in their place? You guys look like you need a honeymoon! Or go alone. Like in that movie 'Queen'. Maybe on that holiday, you'll realize... ...that the man you've spent your life with... ...was never the one! Do you charge to talk? I'm sure you don't preach for free. Ask your husband that question! Is he getting paid to shut up? It's like he's taken a vow of silence. You don't get this in London. These pickles. Dried crisps... Robbie takes it from home. Once you learn to make these pickles... I can retire. I'm going to the market. For some marketing? No. Just to kill time. With whom? With myself! Where are the keys to the scooter? I'll come along. Where are you going? Then how will I get time alone? I'll go by myself. Cousin has taken the scooter. What is she! An atom bomb! Be careful... She might blow up on you. I mean it. Where is he? - He's asleep. Wake up. Wake up! Rumi... This is for standing me up, that night. What's this one for? You guess. Stop pretending to "move on" with Raja's girlfriend! You're a loser! Understand? A loser! You're delusional if you think you let me go! I dumped you! You need to move on! I don't! I got over you, a while ago. And if you can't get that through your head... ...I'll write it down for you! There! Read it aloud! "Rumi... " "went... " "on her own!" Went where? First crossfit. Then keto diet at Kesar Dhabha! Keto is basically Punjabi food. Have you ever seen a fat Punjabi.. Peanuts? Oye! Okay. Tell me something... Have you always been a monk? Tell me something... Have you always been a witch? Sometimes monks step out of their character. But you are never out of character, you witch! Full. Ever yelled at the top of your lungs? Like climbed the water tank, and just yelled "Motherf -" Have you? Villagers! Village people! What happened? The kids are warming up to each other. You sleep. Villagers! Sorry! Again. Go for it!' - Yeah? What's going on? - She's two drinks down. What!' two drinks. And Robbie. He is four down! Villagers! Wait a minute. Only one villager heard you. - You motherf- Don't abuse...your mom. Hello! He was calling out to you. Goodnight. Once more. Ready, 1, 2, 3... Friends, Romans, countrymen! Romeo and Juliet want to say something! But no one's listening! Go to sleep! The kids have exams. Hey... Juliet wants to commit suicide... ...and you're worried about exams! Shakespeare died ages ago! These folks have no idea about Romeo or Juliet or suicides! Yes. Go. Live your life. Losers win even after losing the game. Oh my! I'll never let go, Jack. You won't understand. Robbie! Whatever! Villagers! Oh an airplane! Bye, bye, plane. Bye. City folks! Let's go to London on that plane. Let's go for a movie? Just a month ago.. ..male and female kids were born. And they are going to be included in the group now. Female child's name is Alisha. Alias.. Are you okay? Male child's name is.. That is.. So you only open up when you're drunk? I don't know you that well. What do you mean? I know you what you look like naked, but.. I still don't know if you like fritters or fries. They proudly enquire.. A female monkey is attracted to the strongest male. During the mating season,.. Do you like Kofte? ...the males display their strength. Rainfall or snowfall? Do you vote? Do you scream when you're angry? Do you have your National ID? In the winters, do you keep the fan on? Do you pay taxes? Do you smoke secretly? Why secretly? I smoke openly. Ohh... Fritters. With hot tea. I'll make you an offer you can't refuse! I never make a second offer, once you refuse the first. This blooming love, it teases me, O' girl, your companionship appeases me Like a colours of a prism, pleases me The hopeful dance in my heart, seizes me Oceans churn within a river, like a dance "Like a dance..." Cities swing enchanted, in a trance Colours of a rainbow, that are spread amiss Colours of a rainbow, that are spread amiss You and I, entangled in a butterfly kiss. I fly, fly away, a kite undeterred, Painted in love with the colours stirred Within my heart, Within my being, are playing tunes unheard O friends, I'm flying, a freebird In this sweetest battles of glances blurred For the shortest separation, now seems absurd ! This blooming love, it teases me, O' girl, your companionship appeases me Like a colours of a prism, pleases me The hopeful dance in my heart, seizes me Warriors abandon wars as they prance ! Seasons swing enchanted, in a trance Colours of a rainbow, that are spread amiss You and I, entangled in a butterfly kiss. Hello. Why? Where? Right now? I've realized my mistake. I didn't have the courage to face your family. But today, I told Mr. Robbie about us. I can't live without you. We're meant to be together. I want to stay in this marriage. So do I. I want to stay in this marriage too. Then why are we discussing this? Discussion is a good thing. Look... I don't want us to separate. But what about Vicky? What about him? It's his problem! This is your anger talking. Rumi. Vicky does what he does because... You empower him. I can ignore him. Can you? Until you learn to to ignore him... I can't either. Nor can I stop him. Because honestly... ...it's not my place. So...think over it. If you still want to be with him - I don't want to. There's no rush. What did he tell you? Nothing I didn't already know. He just...filled in some blanks. I'd decided a while ago that I want to be with you. Are you convincing me? Or yourself? Take your time. I don't need time. I want to be with you. Do you love me? With time, I will! I've already begun to like you. I'll fall in love too. Still... Take your time. I don't need to make a choice! I made my decision when I married you. Stop trying to be a martyr! Sacrificing love! If you're so eager to become a saint, then.. Okay. You know... ...you can tell me anything, right? Anything at all. Okay. Okay stop your nonsense. It's making me want fyaar. Fyaar? Switch off the lights! Why? Either switch off the lights, or shut your eyes. What do you want? What is wrong with you? Why did you tell him everything? I won't back out this time! I'll fight the world for you. I live with him! - You don't have to! Why can't you understand! Listen! You'll find someone.. But I want you. I can't get you out of my mind! There's no fyaar with anyone else. No matter where I try to escape to... I only find my happiness on your terrace, your streets, with you! Tell me, what do I do? If you can't be with me, then kill me! Kill me and get this over with! I can't live like this! Rumi, you can count on me. I'm here this time. For good! How will I face him? You don't have to say anything. No one will know if you don't tell. Hi. What happened? Rumi. It's okay. Take your time. It's okay. Look at me, My vexed heart, stupefied I want to live this life, with you by my side For slightest whim of yours, this world, I shall sacrifice. It is only you, for whom I yearn These colours of love, shan't fade or burn, I'm adamant , you and I, live forever with love and laughter This blooming love, it teases me, O' boy, your companionship appeases me Like a colours of a prism, pleases me The hopeful dance in my heart, seizes me This mystic heart swings, upon a single glance, "Dances..." The poet within me, indulged in a platonic dance "Dances..." "Dances..." Why aren't you taking Vicky's calls? Or replying to his texts? He thought everything is resolved! But you aren't talking to him again. He's drinking night and day. Please talk to him once. Who are you? Who's this man? Murmuring in my ear constantly. What do you need, sir? Call me back! I'm dying here. Please meet me once! I'm begging you. I was thinking of stopping by our shop. It's been awhile. Should I drop you there? It's okay. I'll take a rickshaw. No one's home. Why did you stop taking my calls? I told you we're done. Don't do it. Don't do it! Don't do it! If you want me to stop, then ask me to stop. I said stop! Can't you hear me! You wanted to talk, right? Then talk. You keep pouncing on me! Rumi, last time when - What last time? Last time was my mistake! Listen... If I hadn't married Robbie... I wouldn't have stopped you. - As long as you stay married... ...you'll keep making this mistake! Tell me something. When your Robbie makes love to you... ...do you close your eyes and imagine me? Or do you look into his eyes? A wounded heart bleeding, Crumbling homes of broken love. As I fall into the abyss, With teary eyes, I retreat. This heart echoes with silent screams Unrequited love, perched with shadows gleam Love's pious and pure, though dirty it may seem, A callous, wet hem, neither hope, nor a dream While my heart echoes with silent screams Unrequited love, perched with shadow gleams Whose syllable fell, agape and unseen Whose syllable fell, agape and unseen "Love.." "Love.." This heart echoes with silent screams Unrequited love, perched with shadows gleam Love's pious and pure, though dirty it may seem, A callous, wet hem, neither hope, nor a dream While my heart whispers silent screams Poems of love fell, agape and unseen Those syllable fell, agape and unseen "Love.." "Love.." Broken wings of murky night Forlorn, hurt with that sight Rainbows jaded by this smite Laughters swayed by this slight Broken wings of murky night Forlorn, hurt with that sight Rainbows jaded by this smite Laughters swayed by this slight My heart echoes with silent screams Unrequited love, perched with shadow gleams "Unrequited love." You could've told me you'll be late. I was waiting for you. I waited up, last night too. You could've just told me... You could've told me... You still imagine him when you close your eyes. You could've told me... ...that you still haven't forgotten his touch. You deserve him. You're perfect for each other. He can't stand up for you, you can't stand up for yourself. Neither of you have anything better to do... ...than keep going back and forth! You feed off each other! You make me sick. You still have a choice. I'd said that to you. And I gave you that choice... ...because I love you. Very-very much. But your lies... Destroyed everything! I... - Don't. Just... Just... Next time, when you need to go see him... Take the car. Don't go in a rickshaw or on a bike. With your face hidden like a thief! I'm sorry about last night. I overstepped. Rumi. I don't want to stay in this marriage. We haven't registered it yet. So legally it shouldn't be a problem. So, you want to end this? This was never a marriage. You don't have to worry. You won't have to take the blame. Anyway, there are many Indian men... ...who come from London or Canada to marry a virgin. And disappear after the honeymoon. They'll assume I'm one of them. Have you lost your mind? This is not a game. Marry today, separate tomorrow! You're not playing with your dollhouse. This is a marriage. That ... S... Sandhus's son... Is he the reason? So what? She is your wife. These affairs are all forgotten in time. You'll get over it. Son.. Son... I thought... ...you'd pull through. I tried, dad! We tried our best to counsel them. But they had already decided to separate. It's their life. Water purifier. Last one. You had gifted 21 dresses. 20 of them are in the suitcase and she's wearing one. This is embarrassing. Annulment requires you to return the gifts. I need to keep a paper trail for legal matters. Should I make you some tea? I can make some. Some other time. If I stay for tea now... When your luggage comes back from London... I'll bring it here. Our girl has finally become a woman. When will your boy become a man? Don't worry, uncle. I'll get a proper look. No more hair tattoos. Hi! I've... ...called the salon. Robbie came home with your luggage. Get rid of the colors. Definitely! - Get a proper job. Actually, we'd got this done together... So yes, I mean, I'll get rid of the colors. For you I left the world behind, For you I left the world behind, For you I left the world behind, I tried to to stop myself, But my heart's made up its mind I tried to to stop myself, But my heart's made up its mind Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds If luck is not on your side, then call 564322 (TandC apply). Crying out for you, My screams echo through time I feel dead even when I'm alive Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds My cousin Tony lives in Sydney. He runs a cab company. - Tony who? Tony is my sister's son. So you'll work as a cab driver? No! Not a cab driver. He has like 25 odd cabs. - Serve them first. - He's managing it all alone. I'll help him run his business. And whenever I can, I'll DJ. So you'll drive cabs. No, uncle. A cab company! We'll have cab drivers working for us! Tony and I will supervise and manage the company. But I won't sit idle. That's the plan. Can Vicky and I have our tea on the terrace? Vicky you aren't ready for marriage. What? You were right. I was wrong. You aren't ready to get married. What happened? You know, I hit the jackpot! That you were my first love. For me, there'll never be another... ...like you. If someone can't see how special you are... Then they're blind. But... ...you aren't husband material. "Husband material"? What does this mean? You want to go back to him. If wanting was enough, life would be simple. But I'm responsible now. I'll work hard. I won't let you down this time. You need to let me go. Let go. We're better off as friends. What will marriage do for us? You'll own me, I'll own you. Why should we tie each other down? You should go to Australia. Find a new life. I've just begun to understand myself. Only God knows what's in store for me! I'm not even sure if there's anything for me. Why do my eyes deceive me so? Why am I unable to let you go? Why am I unable to let you go? Oh, why do we doubt this love of ours, Twisting and turning hour after hour Twisting and turning hour after hour Twisting and turning hour after hour "Yes..." You are my spirit, You are my being You are everything. You are everything. You are everything. Tomorrow we get anulled. Rumi and I. Everyone's been saying... "It was only an arranged marriage." "Barely a couple of weeks in. Try again." Settling down is very important. I'm not promising that... ...we'll fall in love. We really don't know. Yes. I promise not to cheat on you. I won't lie either. Honestly, I just... ...wanted to tell you everything about Rumi. Yeah, you've told me everything. About Rumi. Do you want to ask me anything? What's my name? There's no rush. Take your time. Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds Crying out for you, My screams echo through time I feel dead even when I'm alive Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds Now the tears flow, Like a river that winds Sorry Kakaji! I'm late, I know. Hello! This way ... Kakaji got you another proposal already? Congratulations. When's the wedding? Why didn't Vicky come with you? He moved to Australia. Read it once. Groom's family has to return the dowry. Done. They have to pay for the expenses incurred too. That's also done. Alright! Just sign and the marriage is annulled. Does she play hockey? Please sign! - Give them a minute. Let them have a moment. She's a doctor. A dentist. She did my root canal. It didn't hurt at all! They're the most respected dentist family in town. Sir. Another case is her. Does she ride a bike? Yes. Wait man! Can't you see? They're having a moment! No. All the best. How are you going home? It's close by. I'll walk. I'll walk you. I've heard it rains quite a bit in London. I like rainfall over snowfall. I've voted in the last two elections. Each time, I promise myself... ...that if we end up with a useless government... ...I won't vote ever again. But I guess I will. I have my National ID. But I haven't linked it to my accounts yet. They spam my inbox with reminders. It pisses me off! And whenever I get angry... I eat really spicy paani puris! In the winters ... I keep the fan on, but get cozy under my blanket. My parents died early. So I manipulate everyone to get my way. Later, I cry alone in my room. I can be melodramatic! I don't like Kofte! But I can devour yogurt dumplings! I'm the witch! But when Grandpa says that my penalty hits are like dad's ... ...I melt completely. In here. I was the first guy in our group ... ...to kiss a girl. 9th Grade! Behind the water cooler. Her name was Kanika. The day she was getting married ... ...she wanted a goodbye kiss. I kissed her but ... But her aunt saw us. That was the day ... I broke all the long jump records! From her terrace to her neighbor's! I was 24 when I had a car accident. The car was totaled but I was safe. Karan lost his leg. He uses a prosthetic leg now. Karan is my best friend. Since then I've been a monk. But... I step out of character when I'm around you. He lives in London too? He's already opened my Tinder account. Vicky and I met on Tinder too. You know how they suggest profiles based on proximity. His profile popped up. Swiped right as soon as I saw him. Haven't used Tinder since that day. We deleted the app from each other's phones. Tell me something. If you knew about Vicky, then why did you marry me? When you already had Vicky in your life ... Why did you agree? Because I was angry. I would've married anybody. And I wanted to take advantage of that. Why? Because I liked you a lot. Liked me or found me hot? First, I found you hot. Then I liked you. It was the exact opposite for you. First, I liked you. What kind of girl were you looking for? Someone who doesn't ride bikes, or play hockey. But here you had bikes, hockey... And a Vicky! And you still married me. Yes. Are you crazy? Yes. Sorry. I mean you were crazy! I still am. So why did you break up? I thought I could deal with Vicky. I couldn't. Was it when you saw us together? When... He asked you a question... ...that you couldn't answer. Which question? "Do you..." "...close your eyes and imagine him.." "..or open them and look at me?" What could I have said?
