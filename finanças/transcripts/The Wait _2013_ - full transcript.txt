[phone begins ringing] Coming... Hello? Hello. Yes. You're a Libra, aren't ya, darlin? Yes I'm a Libra. Who is this? I'm Tia. How did you know that? Can I please have your first name only? It's Emma. Things always happen for a reason, don't you agree? Yes. Love is in the air. I know that... [cont'd] ...this doesn't make sense but, just wait and see, darlin. [cont'd] Hold tight. [cont'd] They will return. Have a good life now. Okay. I'm finished. She's all dressed. That woman that just called, she knew all kinds of things about me. What do you mean she knew all kinds of things about you? Just stuff. Who called? Who was it? She knew Mom had just died. She said... she's gonna come back. That's fucking... That's fucking crazy, Emma. [cont'd] What... what does she mean? She said to wait. To hold tight. She'll return. Love fifteen. Nice shot. [cont'd] Thirty fifteen. I like that the smoke from the fire doesn't bother you. Nope. Doesn't bother me either. Are you okay? My grandma died. Just today? [cont'd] In there? [cont'd] Sorry. Let's wait. [cont'd] Please. Just a few days. I know... She won't know my kids. So what's the harm? Karen's with someone. She looks more and more like Mom. [cont'd] This isn't like you. [cont'd] This isn't like you. Do you like school? I'm good in all my classes. [cont'd] I'm best in history which is weird, cause I don't like it. What don't you like about it? I don't know if all that stuff really happened. Well that's what historians are for. Is that what you are? Someday, maybe. Karen! Who was that? Ian! [cont'd] You know what they say about souls escaping through open windows. Tell me when it's safe to come back. We're gonna have a party for it. You're creepy. We could all use one. Hey, it's me. You alone? [cont'd] You wanna smoke? No, man. What are you doing? Nothing. What's up with the A/C, it's cold. Yeah, I'll turn it down. Looking at porn? Not true. You okay? How's... your mom? Hey, about... I'm sorry about the other night. What do you mean? I don't care, it's just... not for me. What's not for you? You know... I don't. Whatever. Hey, what was here before all the houses? Dinosaurs. Can I use some stuff in your shop? What for? Uh, to build something. Why? Something I've been wanting to do for a while. Oh. Come on, sit sit sit. Nice one, Paul. Green and blue. Still green? Shit. Hello, this is Angela Goren, I'm calling about my mother. This could make the news, sweetie. [cont'd] Most likely one of those morning shows. But Mom... [cont'd] Where's Daddy? He's at home in the city. Can't make it for a couple days. Will they stop the fires? I'll be in in a little while. [cont'd] Tomorrow, we decorate. Are you expecting someone? No. [cont'd] Thankfully, she left everything so organized. Emma, I waited for Karen to go to bed. While I was sleeping? You were gonna let them take her? Calm down! [cont'd] What the fuck?! You didn't hear the voice. Let me go! What are you doing? No! I'm not letting them take her! Last time, you didn't listen to me about that fucked up fiancee of yours and look where that got you. [cont'd] You haven't been touched in a year. [cont'd] You haven't been touched in a year. Can I help you? Angela? That's my little sister. She called. About your mother passing? No, she hasn't. I'm sorry. She's having a hard time. She wakes up thinking it's already happened. Is the hospice nurse here? That's me. I know what they say about family members doing it despite qualifications. That's none of my business. I'm sorry. We understand. You've never done that to me. Yes, I have. Maybe twenty years ago, when we were playing. [cont'd] I'm going to town tomorrow. And when I get back, she should be gone. I only have a few days here. [cont'd] Shouldn't drink around you. What's Henry think of all this? Have you told him? Told him that his wife suddenly believes in magic? [cont'd] You weird fucking loser. You take care of dead people. You took care of Mom... Look at me. I'll bet you didn't even know it was her. Until she fucking died, right? [cont'd] Tell your lucky husband whatever, but tell him he needs to get here. Tell him we've got a lot of work to do. I need Mom's computer back to do it. Hello. Angela. Hi. I saw you with my niece. Yeah. She told me about her grandma. Sorry. They're her favorites. [cont'd] My mom didn't like sweets. It seems the healthiest people get it. You knew she was sick? Karen said. Well, she ate well. Other things were harder. My dad died and she always sort of missed him. Were they soulmates? Nah, they should have got divorced. I'm Ben. Angela. I'll tell her you say hi. Alright, tell her the history student. Alright, tell her the history student. Place a marigold in a cave outside the house. Karen to perform a dance for grandma. Party dresses. Hide the keys. Blooms, drinks, snacks. Call the local news. RADIO: Two of those are in southern Oregon. The wildfire burning in central Oregon has forced the evacuation of the Blackbute Fire Lookout Station, according to the Central Oregon Inner Agency Dispatch Center. Blackbute 2 Fire was reported early this morning, burning on the southeast slope of Blackbute. The fire is about a mile and a half north of Blackbute Ranch and her sisters, and has grown to about 300 acres now. A spokesman from the dispatch center says it appears that lightning caused the fire. A federal team out of central Oregon are being sent... Hey! Hey! Ben! You wanna look at Mars tonight? It's closer to the Earth than it's ever been. Okay. Let's do that. Besides, I don't know what else to do. It'll never reach us. [cont'd] There she is. That's not a girl. That's a girl. Is this on your mom's account? Look! Look at me! [cont'd] Look at me... Look at me, would you... The registry for her death certificate wasn't there. It's another sign. They moved their offices to Bend. You're gonna have her rot in there?! No. It's Mom! Hey, Ian. I left my board here. I haven't seen it. [cont'd] You want a smoothie? That's cool. [cont'd] Where's Sam? They went to Portland for a few days. [cont'd] I just found this taping of a show I was on when I was a kid? But I never saw it. Yeah, Sam said you're on a real nostalgia kick. Here, check it out. ...the top row up here. What's your name? [cont'd] ...third row up, the second one in with the blue jumper... now there's a smile if I ever saw one, right? Do you mind? Does Sammy smoke? [cont'd] How's your mom doing? I'll show you something really good. I want something fun. [cont'd] Like Hawaii. Show me a beach. Boring. [cont'd] Ready? Oh! That was horrible. Why'd you show me that? Watch again. [cont'd] See, this is good. It's real. Alright, play it again - but slower. Mm, you can't. I want, I want to pause it. When? See? Why does she do that? She let- they're holding hands, it's her dad! And she just lets go. Did you grow up here? Yeah, in the summers. My mom and my little brother moved here full time after my dad... Did you know that this whole area is a dried up sea? Oh yeah? I did my research. My dad's been trying to get my to visit for a while. [cont'd] What do you do? Study rocks - more or less. Just make us feel super puny. I don't know why I thought we'd be able to see it. I had a dream today... ...after we met. I took a nap. We met today, right? [cont'd] So Barbara Streisand was on Oprah and she was crying, and she confessed to the world that she had full-blown AIDS. And Oprah took her hand, and she said, "So do I." And they were both just totally crying. And right after she said it, she was crying so hard that she farted. And this really sad moment became really funny for everyone else. And... what's that mean? Oh! [cont'd] I just... I thought it was... They um, take your mom? Yeah. Hey, this is weird but - will you give me something? Give what? Something from your niece. There's only one, do you want to share it? Uhh, yeah. [cont'd] Like what? What do you mean? Um, I'm making her something. What for? She struck me. [cont'd] Something that maybe she used to really like and then forgot about. We have this too. [cont'd] Her first toy. Can I have it back? Sweetie, time to get up. I met a boy, Mom. Will you hang out with me while I get my nails done? Okay... Awesome. Should we get haircuts? Okay. So many colors. [cont'd] Spin it. [cont'd] Spin it. Am I late? Didn't see you. You saying I blend in? You scared me. I'm scary when I'm hungry. I've known you for a day and you've got me stealing. [cont'd] Better be good. I like Grandpa's car. [cont'd] Do you get to have it? Grandma might want to use it. I'm sorry she's sick. No she's not. It's okay. She's not. A horse got covered in that stuff yesterday. [cont'd] It was sad. I saw it. It won't hurt it. It's just magnesium and water and a little iron oxide filled with fertilizer. [cont'd] You know, they used to sacrifice them to stop fires. I thought they used people. Horses, people, robots... What am I doing... Maybe try eating something. Sorry, I - I just can't do this. Alright, how much again? A hundred. Oh shit. My wallet... This is all I have... Forty? Forty. For the premie. The premie. Yeah. The runt. Full box. Keep it a secret. [on phone]: Angela? Hello? Angela... [cont'd] ...Star my number. We lived together for four years. You never swore at me ever. Not once, and I thought that was normal. You made me smart. You made me not afraid. You made me smart. You made me not afraid. [on phone]: Um, listen... So why? You liar. You told me I was paranoid. You were kidding? My baggage? Are you kidding me?! I have never felt as old and ugly as I have this year! And you just kept saying, no no no, and I knew it! I knew it! And you said no! You said no! No! No! It's my mom's. I thought you could use it for your project. Hi kids. Hey, Dad. This is Angela. Hi. Hi. Wish I could stay and chat. It's fine. How was your game? Pretty mean. But I think I saw an alien. I wish you could have met her. What was she like? [cont'd] Like that? I love loving you. Hey, baby. I used to call you that. Everyone's asking about the computer. Yeah. How's Karen? She's good. A little bored. I got her a present. She's gonna get it tomorrow. Okay. You wanna meet by the lake? You too. Can I use your computer? No, not tonight. [cont'd] I watched that damn thing on there twenty times. Well, ours is getting fixed. Just can't get it out of my head. Why'd she let go? Yeah. Watching that stuff's really addictive. It's a huge problem in China. Well if it's a huge problem in China, don't you think it's a huge problem here? [cont'd] What'd you find? Oh, just a book I lent him. It's good you guys read. [cont'd] Hey. He's good, right? Yeah. Alright. To... to... I forget. I hate toasts. [cont'd] No, I don't. To... To the shadows of our forgotten ancestors. Stop... Stop saying good things. [cont'd] Stop saying good things. So cheesy. That's an old wedding toast. You'd never guess where I was gonna be a year ago today... Never guess where I was gonna be. I'd never lie to you. Fuck... Ben? I told you they took my mom. [cont'd] I tried - I tried to get them to take her. I did, I- I... [cont'd] I tried to... Please... No... no... not now. Don't stop... I was gonna record our heart beat but forgot. Sweetie, don't look if it bothers you. [cont'd] ...That's you... that's me... [cont'd] ...That's you... that's me... [cont'd] Turn off all the lights for Momma. Big day tomorrow. It makes sense now. It makes sense now! [cont'd] Ben! Data on computers. Imaging... got... just... [cont'd] You said this place was a dried up sea. Yeah, this- this whole area. You can easily turn someone into silicon, and look at - magnesium from the fire? Retardant is everywhere. That's how you do it. You mix the two and heat it. Should we try it? Maybe it happened! Maybe... when she died the sudden emission of energy got stored in the earth around her. And when it gets too full... It crashes! Yes! And the bits and pieces are released back to where they came from! Will you come? Okay. Yes! You're going to meet her! The whole place! Come on! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise! Rise! Rise up! No, rise! Every room! Rise! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up. Rise... rise... rise... rise... rise... rise... Rise...! Rise...! Rise up! Rise! [cont'd] Where is she? ...Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise up! Please... What? Rise! [cont'd] Rise! Alright, come on. No. We have to. Rise... Let's go back in, Angela! Make it happen... Make her see them, make her see my kids! You like? You look beautiful. Let's row. What are those, clothes from high school? Hey. Hey... Stop hiding. It's okay that you couldn't do it. The fires are out. Henry? Hey! So they couldn't fix it? It was old, so I got this. They transferred everything onto it. Hi, Daddy. Hey, girl. You cut your hair, too. Do you like it? Yeah, baby. Give me a hug. Come here. [cont'd] How's your grandma? Do you wanna go say hi with me? [cont'd] Hey. What you got there? Not now, she's not back. Not back. Can I see now? What do you mean, she went out? A new computer? [cont'd] Karen, why don't you take your uncle and go set it up? What's going on? She's getting ready. What's that box? It was the premie. I'm so sorry. Ben?.... Ben! Ooh, something bad's gonna happen... [cont'd] Just wait and see, darlin. [cont'd] Can I please have your first name only? [cont'd] I'm Tia. I'm Miss Tia. [cont'd] Oh my goodness. [cont'd] I want you to really remember. [cont'd] Just wait and see, darlin. Just wait and see, darlin. [cont'd] You know things always happen for a reason, don't you agree? [cont'd] Love is in the air. You're a Libra, aren't you, darlin? That's you. Your mom's a Libra. Oh my goodness. They will return. I'm Tia. Stop. Have a good life, now. Stop it. Who is it? Uh, it's Sammy - he's in the city. "Below are two nearly identical images." "In them are three slight differences. See if you can find them. Only a genius has been proven to do it." God dammit, what did you show her?! What are these? Flowers. What for? Who sent them? [cont'd] Henry! Can you believe it? She's gone. I just saw her. [cont'd] Emma... Shhh... Sorry... Stop, don't. I had to get better. Don't tell Henry.
