[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ STOOGES: Hello. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] NARRATOR: This is a zany story of nine brothers, three sets of identical triplets born one year apart. Yipe, what a jackpot. Well, when the war broke out, all of them went into the service into different parts of the world. During the war, each set of triplets lost track of the others and where unable to trace each other's whereabouts. Set of triplets number one, Moe, Larry and Joe, served in the infantry and piled up such an enviable record that they where discharged with the lowest possible honors. These fellows are confirmed bachelors and have three weaknesses. Striped ties, pretty girls, and more pretty girls. [WOLF WHISTLES] In all these years, we've never been able to praise our dear brothers. Poor guys, must have been lost in action. What a break. Guys, what a break. Worst break I've ever had. They all owned me money. Quiet, porcupine. And speaking of money, how about the 20 bucks you own me? Oh, yeah, well, I only got 10, so here's 10, I owe you 10. Thanks. Hey, Moe. You owe me 20. Well, here's 10, I'll owe you 10. Uh-uh, you owe me 20, Here's 10, I owe you 10. Here's the 10 I owe you. Here's the 10 I owe you. Here's the 10 I owe you. Good, now we're all even. Even or not, I-I feel sad about our dear brothers. W-We need something to cheer us up, l-like-- Yeah, yeah. Like, girls to cheer us up. Yeah, like girls. Yeah. What will you have? Blonde, brunette or henna color? Oh, henna color with all. Seek and we shall find. Where do you wanna go? I don't know. Where do you wanna go? I don't know. Where do you wanna go? I don't know, where do you wanna go? Quiet, you stupes. Come on, let's go. BOTH: Where do you wanna go? I don't know, where do yo-- Come on, get the coats. All right. Super-- Oh! Larry, look. What's-- [LAUGHS] Oh. Ooh! Ooh, I-- Ooh, I-- Ooh I can't-- LARRY AND MOE: Joe, Joe, Joe, what's the matter? Nothing, nice piece of acting, though, isn't it? Come on. Get your hat and let's go. Come on. NARRATOR: This is set of triplets number two, Louie, Max and Jack. They also had an enviable record in the service. They never got out of boot camp. They're the married brothers, poor saps, and they're still holding hands with their wives. They ever let go their wives will kill 'em. Now, these brothers, by a strange coincidence, are living in the very same city, and like most married men, they're hen pecked and hate to where neckties. Well, we're ready. Well, now, you run along the church and we'll cook you a nice, Sunday dinner. Oh, we're lucky to have such wonderful husbands. They're not only handsome, but they can cook too. Well, kiss us goodbye. ALL: Bye. NARRATOR: Here we have set of triplets number three. Luke, Morris and Jeff. All right, so you're ahead of me. You know they're living in the same city. They where in the Air Corps, uh, pilots. Kitchen pilots that is. They pilot here, they pilot there, they pilot anywhere, but these three dapper suckers bow ties, boutonnieres and all, at this precise moment are becoming engaged to three lovely lasses. Uh, girls, that is. [GIRLS GIGGLE] Oh, boy, we're engaged. I'm the happiest man in the world. [SOBBING] Me too. Me too. [ALL SOBBING] There, there, there, now. Don't cry. We're so thrilled we can hardly wait to go show our rings to daddy. Right. Hey, girls, you run along and we'll meet you in a couple of hours down in the tavern. Yeah, and we'll celebrate with champagne. Goodbye, honey. So long. Bye. It's official, we're engaged, we're engaged. [ALL SINGING INDISTINCTLY] Where's the dames? Joint's deserted. Hey, it's a little early. Will this table do? It has pretty legs. Let's have a scorecard. Thank you. What will it be, gentlemen? Henna color to cheer us up. We'll have a shingle roof. A "shingle roof"? Yeah, it's on the house. [STOOGES LAUGH] Ahem, just make it a bottle of champagne. Yes, sir. Y-yeah, w-with bubbles. Yeah, the cheap variety. Yes, sir. Did you ever see a poker face like that? Mm-hm. There's our sweethearts. ALL: Yeah. If you ever get the dough-- Honey. Dumpling. Dumpling, I'm dumpling. JOE: Mm, you doll. Just what the doctor ordered. Then here's another prescription. MOE: This I like. Gosh, if I didn't see you, I'd think I was dreaming. I've been dreaming about you for hours, darling. MOE: Too good to be true. Do tell, do tell. Mm, you're so sweet. Oh, I am. I'm sweet. Darling, I'm so glad you're here. Well, I'm not exactly sorry, baby. Gosh, you never kissed me like that before. Neither did you. [SQUEALS] Where do you wanna go? Anywhere, dumpling. "Dumpling" she calls me. Sit down. We're gonna have a lot of fun. Hey, waiter, bring six glasses. Oh, guys, isn't this exciting? Oh, boy. Thank you. All right, now beat it, laughing boy. Champagne, my goodness, how extravagant. We are celebrating. Oh, for you girls, anything. But you should save your money, we'll need it. We will? Certainly. After we're all married we'll need lots of money. These babies work fast. That's because we're so irresistible. Oh. Oh, boy. Come-- Pour faster.

[ALL KISSING AND LAUGHING] Our husbands. Well, of all the two-timing chiselers. Why, you no good, how dare you. I'll fix you. Leave them alone. [WOMEN ALL SCREAMING AT ONCE] Hey, fellas, we better retreat. Not me. I-I like to watch women fight over me. Ah, come on. Aw, Moe. [WOMEN FIGHTING] All right, that's it. Oh, all right. Ladies, ladies, please, control yourselves. Control-- Oh, my goodness, I hit the-- [GASPS] [CRASHING] Where are those three no good husbands of ours. Your husbands? You mean you-- Yes, that's right, our husbands. But we're engaged to those guys. And you can have them. If there's anything left when we get through with them. Come on, girls. [WOMEN SOBBING] I think the war is over. Come on. I'm-- I'll never talk to him again. What was this all about? Oh. Ow. Hey. Here's your old engagement ring. We wouldn't marry you if you were the last men on Earth. Oh! Hey, cut it out. What did I do? [STOOGES GRUNTING] [ALL SCREAMING AT ONCE] JOE: They're crazy. They're crazy. MOE: Those women are crazy.

I wouldn't be surprised if they bring us some presents. Yeah, something different. Yeah, something we don't even expect. JACK: Boy, are they beautiful, eh? MAX: Yeah, and what beautiful legs they have. And young. Now, there's something I could really go for. [SCREAMS] You, double-crossing-- [ALL SHOUTING] What happened? What are you doing? Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute! What's this all about? What, have do you girls been drinking or something? Don't give us that, we caught you with those girls down at the tavern and you know it. You must be drunk. How could we be down at the tavern and cooking a meal at the same time? We saw you there. Now, wait a minute. We'll go down to tavern with you and prove we weren't there, and if we're guilty you can smack us over the head with that bat. Good, get your coats and let's go. Come on! All right. We'll prove to you we're innocent. Yeah, we-- What kind of thing is this here. This is a mystery... Hey, waiter, did you ever see us in here before? Are you kidding? Say, how about paying the bill for the champagne you brought the girls this morning? You're crazy, we were never here before. What did I mean? Pay up. [ALL SHOUTING AT ONCE] I knew you were-- You-- You-- [BIRDS CHIRPING] Maybe the girls came back. Yeah. LOUIE: Hey. Hey, you're hurting me. Hey, this seems to be catching. [ALL SHOUTING AT ONCE] Look, it's our brothers. Come on. Hey, cut that out. BROTHERS 2: Brothers. BROTHERS 3: Brothers. What do you know, look at that. [BROTHERS ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE] Gosh, they never told us they had brothers. No. JACK: What a surprise, Let us look at you. Oh, boy. You, guys really look wonderful. LUKE: Wait a minute. I almost forgot. Boys, meet our wives. This is Larry, Moe and Joe. No, I'm Luke. I'm Morris. I'm Jeff. Ha-ha, we never could tell each other apart. Gee, boys, we want to apologize for beating you up this morning. Y-You didn't beat us up, our sweethearts did. No, no, we beat your sweethearts up. Impossible. We didn't see you this morning, and we wouldn't know you if we did. Then you three worms must have been here. BROTHERS 2: No. This is crazy. We weren't even here. We were home cooking. LOUIE: They're plumb crazy. When I see them, I'm going to-- I don't know. I don't know either. LOUIE: There's something fishy around here. MORRIS: What do they want, what's going on here? JACK: I don't know. Neither do they. LUKE: Yeah, what's this? Morris. Jeff. Luke. I'm Louis. I'm Jack. I'm Max. I'm mortified. Gosh, we made a terrible mistake. Oh, please excuse us for hitting you this morning. Uh-oh, here we go again. Everybody is crazy. You didn't hit us. You hit us. ALL: Oh, we're so sorry. We apologized. ALL: And we apologize too. But you had it coming. You're married to these three ladies. BROTHERS: No. BROTHERS 2: We are married to them. [GASPS] Darling, I'm sorry. Me too. Yes. Now that this is all settled, you can give us our rings back. Give them back? We gave you them this morning. But we give them back to you. What are you trying to pull? What are you trying to pull? WOMAN: We gave them to you. BROTHERS: You didn't. WOMEN: We did. You didn't, you didn't, you didn't, and that's final. WOMAN 2: We gave them to you. BROTHERS: You didn't. WOMEN: We did. Brother. Brother. [BROTHERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] This gets worse by the minute. They go like peas in a pod. Or else we're seeing things. Is this real? Something tells me these last ones are the brothers we met this morning. JEFF: You boys. This is a miracle. Now, no rough stuff girls. Yeah, here's your rings. Here. ALL: Oh, thank you. [WOMEN SIGHING] We love you. We're sorry. Oh, darling, we've been awful. MAX: You sure have. LOUIE: Skip it. Give us a kiss. I have an idea. Listen, everybody, let's all go back to our house and celebrate this wonderful reunion. Oh, wonderful. Right, now, look. You folks run along, Louie, Jack and I will pick up a few bottles of champagne and we'll be home later. Come on, let's go. [ALL CHATTERING] JACK: Everybody go. That's it. There they are. Now, let's see, where's the-- There he is. Hey, waiter, wake up. Wake up. It's you again. Yeah, we want six quarts of champagne. But you haven't paid me for the champagne you bought. You got us in enough trouble with your lie already. Are you calling me a liar? STOOGES: Yeah. Hitting my brothers. [WAITER GRUNTING] Good, good, that was good. That was good. That's bad. [BROTHERS SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] We better tell our brothers we'll order the sandwiches. I wonder where they went? LUKE: You got me. MORRIS: Me too. I'll get them. A-ha! I'll chop you to ribbons! [BROTHERS SCREAMING] Now, how do they get around so fast? I'll fox them. Say, waiter, did you-- Ah, now I got you. [ALL CRY OUT] [ALL SHOUTING] Uh. Oh, no. [SCREAMING] I surrender. Now I've got-- Wait a minute. It's for you. Oh, thank you. Hello, hello? Hello? I'll kill 'em. [ALL PANTING] That guy is crazy. Oh, no. Oh, oh, oh. [♪♪♪]
