IN A JEAN VALÃˆRE FILM THE BIG BITE BASED ON THE CHARLES WILLIAMS NOVEL "THE BIG BITE" Willes attacks. He dribbles past his opponent. This is the great Willes we're seeing, almost arrogant in his feints. He's still coming down! After his accident, this is amazing! He's almost to the 18-yard line. He's going to shoot! He shoots. A dislocated knee with ligament damage, that stays with you. You should have waited to fully heal before playing. Read the contract. It's very clear. You've told me 15 times. You got yourself into this. I contacted the insurance agency. They don't want to get involved. You only have 20% left of the ten million the policy provided for, and it's just an allowance. Thank you. If we come to two million, it's to prove to you our good faith. It's better than one. Sign. Hello, Franck. You tried to reach me? I haven't had a free minute in a week. I even popped over to London. What about you? I'm great. Vacation, you know. I get up in the morning, and you want to know what I do all day? Nothing! Nothing, old boy. Nothing at all. I had it all planned out. With 80 million, the Etretat Hotel. Four years to pay it. -Are you listening? -Yes, Franck. Here we go! Come on. Since this morning, I'm French. What good is it to me? You know what I think? My hunting lodge. If you want, I'll give you the keys. Get out of town. It'll take your mind off things! We'll see. We'll see. Straight in! No, no. I went for the goal. I shot. I almost scored. No! Yeah! They'll let you take over the junior team. Yeah, they offered me that. And you accepted, I hope? Look for work. You know people. I need some time. -There's more than soccer. -You don't understand. It wasn't just a job for me. Work. Martine! Stay with me this afternoon! But Franck, my job. Call in sick. They can find someone else, can't they? I can't. You know I can't. "Can't". What's with you today? Be reasonable. I told you. It went fine. Here, I got you something. You can hang it up in your office as a souvenir. -Franck Willes? -Yes. -I need to speak with you. -Why? I did some investigating on you. Is that so? What about? The Grandval case. -I thought it was closed. -Officially, yes. At the accident, did Mr. Grandval seem drunk? He seemed dead is what he seemed. He hadn't drunk at all. How do you know? Let me tell you something. Mr. Grandval had a life insurance policy of 100 million. His wife got the dough. -What do I care? -You never know. How much did you get? Two million? Go, go! Who exactly are you? Sorry, my name is Drouin. I'm with Chervin Insurance. We insured Grandval. I examined the car. Or what was left of it. If you'd like to find out more, go take a look at the connecting rod. Where is all this headed? That all depends on you. How's that? Come on. Out with it! No, not today. As soon as I'm sure. Sure of what? I'll tell you then. See you soon, hopefully. Very soon. So you think she cooked all this up? She and him. -Who, "him"? -Her lover. -The classic tale. -Why look elsewhere? It's like for a tie. The darker it is, the better. Loving money and another man, that'll always be good taste. This isn't much proof. I have more. You know this? The connecting rod was cut. And it's not the only one. What does she do? Boats. Grandval motors. It was the husband's. Now it's hers. Thanks to you. -To me? -No need to be proud of it. He could have just as well hit a tree. -Call the police. -Gladly. But in that case, someone's going to look like an idiot. -Who? -You. Are you nervous? Yes. -What were you saying? -Nothing. I was asking you. Who got 100 smackers and gets to play the happy widow? Who lost his job, winds up crippled, and basically penniless? One more reason to call the police. There might be another solution. Me, I'm for justice. I think that 100 million is ours. -Ours? -Well, yours, excuse me. But I have the proof, and you can't get the money without me. Hang on a second. This was my lucky file. So I kept it for myself. -And the police investigation? -Oh, case closed! Here's a copy of the hearing. "Accident due to lack of headlights." "Driver had been drinking," etc. So? My dear friend, this is what's called blackmail. Yes, on my end, perhaps, but for you? You, who lost everything? It's a small recompense. You've been wronged. You should be compensated! You have the proof, so why not go it alone? Why do I need to be involved? -Do you know Michel Arland? -No. The real estate agent. No alcohol for me. He's the wife's lover. A man of the world, a real strapping fellow. You're scared of him? Think about it. He takes out Mr. Grandval. You think he'd hesitate to do me? If they hear about it, I'm dead! Despite your proof? If it's just me, they're not worth a thing. They'd have no reason not to take me out. But if someone goes to the wife with the photocopies, says to her, "My good lady, "I have a friend with the originals. "If anything happens to me, he'll call the cops." In that case, she's trapped. If a tenth of what happened to you had happened to me... Aren't you going to answer? Who's there? TV company. I'm looking into the service outages. -Do you have a card? -Of course. Slide it under the door. HOTEL DU GRAND CERF Thank you. GRANDVAL GRANDVAL NO DEVELOPMENTS IN DROUIN MURDER CASE Can you give me the Grandval store across the street? Hello? Mrs. Grandval, please. Mr. Leechoch. What is it regarding? I'll tell her myself. I'm sorry, she'd like to know. I represent Malove and Sons, in London. Don't hang up. Hello? -Mrs. Grandval? -Yes. This is Peter Leechoch. I bought the French import license for a new cylinder head joint for marine engines. Would you be willing to meet with me? I'd really love to, sir, but I already have a supplier. I'm not asking for any commitment. Just a sit-down. I'd feel bad when it doesn't come to anything. Why don't you write me? I knew Mr. Grandval well. Is that so? We almost went into business together. Well, I'll be sure to read your letter carefully. Yes, but... Thank you for calling, sir. Goodbye. You're playing great today! Good thing there's not an audience! That's good for today. Hello. Is Ms. Grandval here? Let me check. Who can I say is here? -Mr. Willes. -Come in. -Mr. Villais? -No, Willes. Or Villes, if you'd rather. No one can blame a Spaniard for mangling German. I'm very glad to finally meet you. -Have a seat. -Thank you. Glad but embarrassed. It's unforgivable that I didn't come see you in the hospital. Your flowers were some consolation. To be honest, I didn't have the courage. I felt responsible for your... It wasn't at all your fault. Of course. I was in a rather... embarrassing situation. If anyone should feel guilty, it's me. You suffered much more than I did. Your husband was... I didn't blame you for a second. Thank you. Mr. Willes, if there's any way I can be of service to you... That's kind, but I don't need anything. -Have you found a job? -I'm not looking. If you decide to one day, don't hesitate to pay me a visit. It'd be a pleasure in any case. The accident may have rendered you inactive, but the contrary is true for me. I had to take over my husband's business. It's not easy for a woman alone. Well, I'm handling it. No one's helping you? No one. Would you like some fruit juice? Gladly. You have a beautiful yard. Thank you. Please excuse me. -I have to be going. -Of course. I hope we'll see each other again. Me too. Goodbye, ma'am. Hello, miss. -I'd like a cassette recorder. -Which model? The smallest and the best. To the judge of Versailles. If you get this letter, it means that I've been killed by Michel Arland, with the help of Ms. Clemence Grandval, who resides in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. I will have been prevented from divulging the following information. They are guilty of two murders, of Grandval and of one Drouin, expert at an insurance company. I used this information in an attempt to extort 100 million francs from them. This admission alone proves that what I'm claiming is true. My name is Frank Willes. Mr. Willes? Don't you think it's a bit early? I need to speak to you. The maid isn't up yet? Leave now before I call the police. That's exactly what a mutual friend proposed to me. But they convinced me that it'd be stupid. -So, the maid? -She arrives at nine o'clock. You'll send her home if we're not done. At your orders, Mr. Willes. May I sit? Is this so important? I wouldn't have gotten up at this hour... Did you read the amount? Yes. Hundred million. It's reasonable. I knew you'd give me a friendly rate. Would you prefer a check or cash? I'm not kidding around. Neither am I! -Are you messing with me? -Not at all! But why 100 million exactly? Because it'd be unjust for you to make off with it. I don't want to be dramatic, but my life is a wreck. My career even more so, thanks to you. 100 million, paid for by insurance, is the least of it. This is all rather dull, darling. Just read the police report. I know it by heart. My husband was drunk. It's a shame he isn't here to throw you out. Ask Michel Arland, then. -Michel Arland? -Doesn't ring a bell? What's this got to do with him? Read my letter again, if you can't remember, and call him. This is ridiculous. Call him. I want him to know. Like you don't know the number. Tell him to come immediately. Mr. Arland? -Mr. Arland. -Yes? Read it. -It's the result of an investigation. -What investigation? About some television outings in the area. Is that a joke? You've got to have a laugh sometimes. Read. I'll tell you right now that a friend of mine has the copies. If anything were to happen to me... Look, Mister... -Remind me of your name? -Willes. Mr. Willes. I have no choice but to consider this a farce. The most you're at risk of is that I yawn rather than laugh. Yes, it is pretty funny that I'm asking for 100 million. Not now, Melita. Bring breakfast, please. -For three? -No, just for me. -One hundred million. -Get the hell out, or I'll call-- The police? It must be love. Call them, then. If Drouin discovered this alone, what do you think a dozen cops will turn up? You have till tomorrow to think it over. I'll be back at the same time. But... I won't negotiate. One hundred million or nothing. I don't think so. I told you to beat it. Go over there. But... I won't negotiate. One hundred million or nothing. Calm down, darling. There's no point in getting upset. -I'm sure he's bluffing. -You know he isn't. We should pay. Are you crazy? It's 100 million now, it'll be another 100 later. This won't end well, Michel. Come here. Stay home. You've always trusted me? Yes. You've always approved of my decisions? Always. But I'm frightened. -It must be done. -No, it's impossible. First Philippe, this Drouin, and now... I don't want this. I'll pay. I must. -Without the 100 million-- -I'll lose everything, I know. I'll declare bankruptcy. Your jewelry, this villa, it'll all be gone! But Michel... There's only one way out. First, I need to know if this guy has an accomplice. I don't think so. I told you to beat it. Go over there. Get back. Hello, Claude? Very well, thank you. Never been better, in fact. I've got the thing in my pocket. Yes. Yes, great. You can listen to it. With this, they'll get sent away till the Last Judgment. OK. Noon, at the radio station. Mr. Arland. -Your car keys. -What for? So you won't follow me and the lady. Why? You're going to drive me to Paris. Put a raincoat on. You won't leave the car. Claude? Let's go. Don't try it. He's my best friend. Almost a brother. He'll only give the recording to me. You've got no way out. Yes, I do. By paying. If I saw a way out, I guarantee you that you wouldn't get a cent. I'll give you 30 million. I said 100 or nothing. I can't get 100 million that fast. I have to sell my shares. My accountant will do it, but he can't liquidate it all at once. How long will it take? You'll have it all by next Friday. I can make three payments. Congratulations. I know my way around business. -May I? -Of course. May I? It's beautiful. Yeah? -I was saying, it's beautiful. -Yeah, yeah. I didn't picture you here. -Have you lived here long? -No. This is all yours? No. -Is the count right? -Perfect. -See you Monday. -Twelve o'clock sharp. -Don't walk me out. -No, I want to. -Be careful of Arland. -Don't be scared. He's furious that I'm paying. I can defend myself. See you Monday. 37 in Etretat. Hello, Durieux? Fine, thanks. It's very important. I want to know if you're still selling your hotel. Yes? Great. Listen carefully. I'm your buyer. Perfect. I'll be there Tuesday with ten million for a down payment. What's wrong? Did something happen? He locked me up at home all day. I was only just now able to escape. I can't bear it. Are you sure you're not making things up? No, I swear. I swear. He's capable of anything. I can't even go back home. That's your own business. Speaking of, where's the money? Count it. I'll take your word for it. -Are you thirsty? -No, thanks. -Cigarette? -No, I'm shaky enough as it is. I can't get you anything? Deep down, you're not such a bad guy after all. Next Friday, the rest of it. I won't wait another day. I know. I keep my promises. Actually, I think I will take something. -Do you only have beer? -That's it. Clemence! -Did you give him the money? -My money. Come here immediately! You're wasting your time. -I order you to come. -By what right? I won't say it again! -Come, or else... -Or else? You're staying with me till Thursday. You'll be my hostage. Is that all? Maybe your little domestic dispute was all an act, but I'd rather not take the risk. Once I have the money, he'll do with you whatever you want. And if I refuse? The keys. Where are we going? On a honeymoon. Don't forget. Your name is Clemence Calon. We'll get adjoining rooms. At this point... -Georges! -Franck! -How are you? -Good, and you? Just fine. Georges Durieux, the reformed boss. I'm selling him the place. Here you are. -Looks good? -Perfect. Is this your first time in Etretat? Yes, but Franck's told me so much about it! You'll have such a nice time that you'll come back! I'm certain of it. Well, take a load off. See you later. Yep. You'll have to go through my room to get to the shower. How cozy. -You'll have dinner here. -All alone? And locked in. If I had to choose, it's better than prison. I'm safe here. No one'll come looking for me. What trust we have here. Taste. -Like it? -It's fantastic. Look out. My first year here, I gained 13 pounds. -Are you staying long? -Two days. Isn't that enough? Too bad your friend won't be dining with us. She's tired. Are you two a serious thing? Yeah, very serious. I'm wondering whether she's the future lady of the manor. You know, the one who does the books. I love it here! I could have slept for ages! And I think I'm going to keep it up! Get ready. I'm going to order some coffee. With toast and some good Normandy butter. -And to whom do I owe all this? You? -All what? The nice weather, the ocean... this taste of salt. Yes. Now get up. I don't have time to lose. I'm hungry, I'm hungry! Go on. Smile a little! What festivities do we have planned for today? The contractor and a notary, to start. Oh! I love it. I've always enjoyed a man taking care of his chores. Would you do me the honor of the beach? And why not the casino? Well, aren't you just the consummate gentleman! We're here on business. You don't have to be rude. Don't worry. I won't throw myself at you. I'd gladly accept after the third envelope! BENEDETTI CARPENTRY Oh, no V-necks! No, I don't like it. Too bad it's gray. -I'll take two. -It's the last one. Keep it, then. I only ever buy in pairs. Could you pass me a towel, please? Thank you! You've got some very good ideas about the hotel business. But in my opinion, you should think bigger. A pool, an amusement park. I'm not kidding! LITTLE HEADWAY IN DROUIN INVESTIGATION How's the sale of the shares? You should call your businessman. Yes. Hello? Two lemon teas, please. Thank you. I called yesterday, from Paris. Everything's underway. I hope so for your sake. Come in! You work too hard, darling. Are you crazy or what? I thought we were... God knows what I'll end up thinking. 97% OF FRENCH WOMEN SURVEYED SAID YES You read in front of ladies? Let's not get too comfortable together. I was just practicing. What are you thinking about? It's silly we met like this. A hundred million. Be quiet. It's all I think about. The more I think about it, the more I... Franck. Yes? I don't care about the money. But they remind me that you were right and I was wrong. Val d'Or, 12 80. Who are you calling? -A friend of mine. -Ah, I see. Hello, Claude? It's Franck. Fine. I'm coming back to Paris tomorrow. Let's meet... Friday, around midnight. No one answered. Around midnight, at your hunting spot. You can give me the recording. Everything went very smoothly here. Sir, no one answered. OK, darling. Excuse me! When are you giving me the recording? Friday, for the money. I was thinking, this morning. I'm going to sell my villa. And the Grandval business, too. What do you think? I could sell it all in a week and come join you in Etretat. I need to teach you how to pick out your ties. Let's not make plans for the future. But who said anything about that? I haven't changed in three days. Franck, I'd like to stop by my house. Not in a million years. We're going back to Paris. Just to get changed. I don't want to meet my businessman like this. Don't be ridiculous. It'll take ten minutes. Don't turn the lights on. -Where's the light? -Here, by the bed. -Let's stay here tonight. -No. Did you have a good trip? Excellent. -It was all planned, wasn't it? -Everything. Even our little tiff at the hunting lodge. She and I put on quite a show for you that day. You're forgetting that I have a friend. And that friend is waiting to hear from me. They won't sit back and do nothing. When did you last speak to them? Tell him. You're not talking? Did you forget my phone call? You were there, though. In the nude. Remember? That was part of our plan, too. I'm sure. But that part cost the least. Mr. Willes, you're just making yourself into more of a lout. You looked into my friend? Yes. No way to figure out what his role is. Did you search their place? Turned it upside-down. Didn't find a thing. What were you looking for? You know very well. A cassette. Are you stupid? You saw me give it to my friend. Your eyes were wide open! Sit down! Who said I believed it? When did he make that phone call? Yesterday morning. To Paris? Yes, Val d'Or. I don't know which number. His friend only got back to Paris yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, he was in Scotland for a story. Your information's bad. I doubt that. I looked into him. I even watched his programs. In fact, if not for that unexpected trip, he'd be here with us. Clemence and I had decided to confront you. At this point, I don't see any reason to bother the gentleman. Admit that your friend isn't involved! Tomorrow, midnight, at my hunting lodge. If I'm not there, he'll go to the police. I'll go in your place. We'll wait 24 hours. Get up. Lie down. Clemence. Yes? I didn't mean anything to you? It's too late to talk about that. I gave you your chance. I was ready to go with you. But you said, "Let's not make plans for the future." From that moment on, it was all over. It was stupid of me. Why can't we try again? When I make a decision, I go all the way. You're crazy, Clemence! There's no end to this. I know. But what else can I do for now? It's either you or me. You're going to kill me? Clemence! Let's go away, you and I. So the hundred million will stay ours? What if you loved me? And I loved you? Listen to me, Clemence. You bitch! Clemence! Your friend hasn't shown. At midnight, you'll see. I forgot to tell you. You were this close to losing her. If I'd wanted, Ms. Grandval was going to dump you. She practically begged. You can't have it all. Love and the money. You didn't care if she'd slept with me. As long as she came back to you. It's 1 a.m. Your friend must have forgotten. I just got back from your hunting lodge. Nobody there. You still won't tell us where the tape is? The door's locked. Open up. Open it. Come on. Open it. Take your dress off. Take your dress off! They're going to force their way in. Hurry. Quick! You were asleep. They woke you up. I was afraid for you, Ms. Grandval. -Why? -The gunshot. A gunshot? You didn't hear it? I was asleep. I didn't hear a thing. I was sure it was here. Let's search the house. There's no point. All the doors were locked. -Let's go next door. -Excuse us, ma'am. Go wait upstairs. Come on. I need you. Get dressed. Franck. Do you really mean what you said yesterday? What? That you were a bitch? That you wanted to go away with me. I'll tell you the same thing you told me. It's too late. Too late. Even after what just happened? I'm not just talking about love but about logic. How can we split up now? I think exactly the opposite. The only thing keeping us together is the money you owe me. Today you'll get the money from your businessman. It'll be a bit of a strange goodbye. This one, or another... Hurry up. Here you go. Are you happy? -The tape. -Thank you. -You don't want it? -Not particularly. -Why? -I don't need it anymore. -What are you going to do? -I don't know yet. Leave you, in any case. Fear will follow you now. The oddest thing about this is that you were my role model. Remember the letter you wrote to the judge? What are you getting at? My businessman is a former lawyer. I left him an account of everything you've done. You covered up two murders, Willes. You were an accomplice to a third. I made very clear your involvement. The file will be opened after I die. You can't do this to me. I was a victim in all this. Yes, but you played the role poorly. Too bad for you. Let's go back to your businessman! -Where's the file? Where is it? -In a safe. -What safe? -That's not my concern anymore. Which floor? Where's the safe? Never!
