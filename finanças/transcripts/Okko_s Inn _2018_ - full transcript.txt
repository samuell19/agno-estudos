The water is hot. It is a hot spring. Torii ! Torii ! Okko. It was at this hot spring our ancestors saw wild animals swim to heal their wounds. So they also started to get there regularly. The source Hananoyu accepts everyone. Animals and human beings. She really accept everyone? Huh? No nothing. Children, we dreamed to be part of this show. It's not true ! If, I assure you. Even at my age, it would tell me. Viewing. Let's go to avoid being stuck in traffic. I see you want to quickly go home. Not at all ! I have not had the opportunity to greet your mother. She was busy. The inn was full. How old is she ? 70 years. We should think about the future of this hostel. - Okko. - Yes ? You know, Water source Hananoyu is a gift of the gods. Every year, two children express their gratitude dancing. - I wish you were one of them. - Me too. It's okay ? Call an ambulance ! They had an accident. I go. Look at this picture. Magnificent ! You're weird, Mom. You too ! Hananoyu Thermae Station Hananoyu Thermes Street What do you say to this? It's from here. It was that far? OKKO AND GHOSTS Harunoya Hello ! Okko! Welcome ! Welcome, Okko. Spider! "Spider"? Etsuko, it is on your head. Come here. I did not feel. Go away. Grandma! Excuse me, my granddaughter is not very discreet. Over here, please. She is full of energy. It is impolite. Do not just stand there. The guests arrive. Let them pass. Pardon. Your room is down the hall. Thank you. Give me your suitcase. No, thank you, that's fine. Welcome. It is in this sense. Who is here ? Who are you ? You can see me ? Why you float? It'll be interesting. I am a ghost. I've lived here a long time. A ghost ? Since a long time ? My name Uribo. Delighted, Okko. You just put your finger in the nose. A ghost booger is not dirty! Come on, shake my hand! I found myself a nice friend. I am happy ! Okko! Okko ... She had to see a mosquito. Okko, I'll enter. What happened ? I have enough. You closed the curtains. Stop, there's a lizard on the window! It's just a gecko. It has cold blood, so he likes to be in the sun. And then there's that one. Who is that ? Stop clean out your nose! Sorry. I'll introduce you to Ko and Etsuko. Come see us in my room. - Okay ! - Okay. And stop yelling. You're going to scare everyone. I remind him. Excuse me. You do not look at all Mineko. You know the name of my grandmother? We are old friends. You have to join her in her room. Hurry up ! Stop following me. Do not say that. I finally found someone to talk to. I do not want to talk to a ghost. No one can see me or hear my voice. But I can? That's because you almost died recently. You could connect to the other world. Tell me... Is it you who helped me? Mineko t'attend. Okko will live here from today. I count on you, Etsuko. Very well. On you, Ko. It's heard. Enchanted. It was such a horrible accident. Um yes. Your parents came to help us when there were many. Okko! Tell them you will give them a hand. Mineko working very hard here. You could replace it. I would take the reins of the inn? You'd do that? In fact... Okko, repeat after me. "I will learn to manage the inn." I'll manage the inn? It does not matter. Mineko, Okko says she wants to help you manage the inn. You want to run the inn for me? That is to say... Here we go, Okko. You'll be the apprentice innkeeper Harunoya! The innkeeper apprentice? Apprentice innkeeper! What a great idea! I'm really thrilled. What do you think ? Okay, but she's still in school. True, Etsuko. I do not know what job I want to do. Do not worry. I'll show you the ropes. Yes, but... Bring your help to Mineko. Hear the voice of the one who saved your life. It'll be a very good experience. You are right. I'm going to find you a kimono, Okko. Super ! Dring, dring! Thank you, Okko! You're welcome. Do not come unless I call you. But I'm so happy! It's ok I got it. I can die happy now. Do not say that. He's already dead. Tomorrow, innkeeper apprentice. Shut up ! He disappeared. It's really a ghost. You are alive! "Kerria japonica" House. Breakfast is ready. "Winter Daphne" House. Two people. Thank you. Dring, dring! Dring, dring! Bizarre. Come back when you want. Hello. What happens to you, Okko? Say hello. Hello. I understand you're going to become apprentice innkeeper. Work hard. I promise. I look forward to see you at work. You know what it is ? Yes. Your grandfather bought this amulet in a tile shop which has existed for a millennium. The box remained there since his death. - You open? - Yes. The bell sounds different. Really? I had forgotten this album. Who are these people ? Your great-grandfather and your great-grandmother. So this girl is ... It's me. I was about your age. Here is... Osaka We lived at the time. This boy... It was our neighbor. Makoto. His surname was Tateuri and was nicknamed Uribo. He is alive in this picture. You were friends? We often played together. I was a tomboy. We were running everywhere. It was a secret place just by us. I was so bold that one day I fell off the roof. Uribo! What? Did you see what time it is? The sun is high in the sky. You've climbed up there alone? Come join me. Okay, I arrive in two minutes. Let's go to look at Mount Ikoma. Attention ! Uribo! Mineko ! It's okay ? You're all disheveled. I'm not bald. I have hair. Me too. Good. Uribo saved my life. It was a nice playful boy. I adored. I loved you too, Mineko chan. I wonder where he is and what he has become. He always love you, Grandma. It's very nice of you to say. Grandma does not know you're dead. That's because I died right after she moved. What happened to you ? I felt lonely without her so I climbed on the roof, as we always did together. The tiles gave way and I fell. I see. This incident allowed me to see her. More... Power protect enough. You, you're alive. You can be at her side. Never leave Harunoya. Okko, I want to show you our secret place. Unbelievable ! I will create a rain of flowers. That's wonderful ! I retouched my child's kimono. I look like a power pole with arms and legs. It suits you very well. It is necessary that your toes are slightly curled. You must take three steps with tatami. Do not walk on the edges. Bend the right leg and keep it straight bust. Aouch aouch ! Leave your shoes outside. You're gonna take your feet in the hem. I knew it. Customers are not going to pick up insects in your place. Working at the inn, it's hard. Stop complaining. Yes, but... Pray for them. You do good work. I brought you your snack. You should wear more clothes to clean. Thank you. I try to get used to the kimono. I see it. Spring cake! This is the Harunoya cake created by Ko san. It has the taste of spring. Tomorrow is the start of classes. Be polite to your new classmates. Yes. Where did its go ? Uribo! You stole my cake? It is not me. The ghosts can not eat. Yes I can imagine. It is you who have eaten my cake, Dad? Okko, go get dressed. It's back, today. The kimono fits you very well. I will greet your mistress. This is your new friend, Oriko Seki. Say hello to the class. I Oriko Seki, but my nickname Okko. I live in Harunoya. That's great ! Welcome, Okko! Harunoya lives! Uribo also goes to school? - No running! - Okay ! I Yoriko. My family had a candy store in the Hananoyu street. Hi ! I'll put on hold, Oriko. Beware of Big Pink Bow. - Big Pink Bow? - Yes. She has big ... pink bows. So you live in Harunoya? My grandmother is innkeeper. We also have a hostel Shuko Ryokan. You have to know her. My name Akino Matsuki and I'm an only child. The inn Harunoya is pretty cute, right? Yes thanks. This is a small wooden house with just five rooms. It serves local vegetables and fish from the river. Yes. With us, the food is plentiful. Our breakfast is popular. What a shame! Some rooms have outdoor baths. To satisfy customers, we must make investments. I want you. You do not have such problems. What are you laughing at ? Sorry, Big Pink Bow. Big Pink Bow? Why do you say that ? Your dress has a big pink bow. Is what you are trying to make fun of me? No, but you do not go unnoticed. You stand out a little among others. I refuse to lock myself up in the normality. It's better to dress in the fashion of our time. No, I do not want to be normal. The society... The universe ... "I want to put a ding in the universe." By Steve Jobs. You're a vulgarity! Try not to further ruin the reputation of Harunoya. What do you mean ? Our hostel works fine. You're great ! No one had ever told her she denoted. - I thought not. - I loved ! You have a lot of courage. What's on your face? It's okay ? I thought you were the only ghost here. I ran after her, but she disappeared. Okay, Akane? Drink some water. Here. I wonder what he has. Go ask them. What do you mean ? You might say, "Is he sick?" or "Are you lost?". Okay. Thank you for your concern for us. My son has a fever. We look for a room, but everything is complete. Room ? Why not invite them to the inn? Grandma will forgive me? Mineko does not judge people on their appearance. My family runs an inn. Want to go? I'm the landlord. Welcome to Harunoya. Excuse me for disturbing you. You see, Mineko is nice and polite to all customers. Enter, please. Do you want what I call a doctor? No that will be good. It often has a fever when he is tired. Thank you. The baths are conducive to healing. - We arrived on time. - Yes. You are doing a trip? Yes. We visited a grave and we stopped here. My wife passed away last month. This is really terrible. I'm sorry. All my condolences. They all say the same thing. When we say that Mom died, people always pity for us. I had enough. Akane. Let's move on. I did not want to accompany you here. Stay in bed, Akane. It is a tiny place in the middle of nowhere. Say again ! What? Can't you see your father trying to cheer you up? What in you know? I know it ! I just lost my parents. I work hard so that we do not worry for me. I hate this mentality needy. Especially when it's not necessary. Akane, that's enough! You are talking about me ? Okko! Yes, Miss Choleric. What is unpleasant! You are very unpleasant. That's right, tell him! Tais-toi, Okko. Although Akane is the same age as you, there is a customer. Apprentice innkeeper Harunoya does not behave this way. I would like a little more normal customer. Do not judge customer from a vague concept. Speaking of "normal customer" means that you do not observe people. This goes against the hospitality. The source Hananoyu rejects no one. She welcomes everyone. It is a gift of the gods. When you get yourself calmed down, we'll go apologize. I can not. Let's go. One. Go. Please, Mrs. and Miss innkeeper apprentice innkeeper. Get up. We are responsible. Thank you for your kindness. I'm so sorry. I should thank you for this discussion. Fever Akane dropped. I'm hungry. You see ? We'll bring you dinner. Thank you. I want a rice omelet. Akane, we are not in a restaurant. We will prepare you. And... Yes ? The cake. Do not be so difficult. I asked in case. I'll go buy. Why annoy you for this rude? Closed When I see Akane, I feel like a pain in my chest. I want to do something for him. It's closed here too. Closed on Tuesdays How will I do ? You're the girl who lives in Harunoya. I would like a nice ... You're named... Spring cake! Thank you Madam ! Cake? No offense. It's very good. There will be enough for customers. Thank you, ko san. I want some too. Sorry, the store was closed, but try it. Thank you. Akane... Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll get rid of. That was delicious. Akane swallowed his omelette in a snap. Thank you. You ate everything. I'm happy. Hey, Yuki. It is... The innkeeper also served my wife. We could eat together again. We did well to come. Is not it ? Grandma! - Its good ! - A delight. I've learned to cook well, it shows. Another bite, honey. Not in front of her. Eat alone, my love. Its good. Mom, Dad, tell me ... You're alive, is not it? Of course. Yes. Papa... It's late ! There's nothing more? I wanted to stay longer, but Akane wants to go to school, then we go before he changes his mind. The taxi arrived. In addition, the Teenage innkeeper motivated him. Really ? Okko! The taxi's here. I arrive ! What is it ? - Okko. - Yes ! What you got on your face? You scared me. You're really weird. Sorry for my face. Okay. Yesterday I ate your cake with Mom. He was very good. Thank you, Miss Apprentice innkeeper. Hi, innkeeper apprentice! Goodbye ! Goodbye ! You must not show your elbow when you greet someone. Go wash your face. I have an errand for you. Oh no ! It must be the school's ghost who designed this mustache. You know what ? What? It's good to make people happy. I love my job innkeeper. I see it. Hello. I am the innkeeper apprentice Harunoya. The innkeeper sent me on an errand. And... Okko! Look! How beautiful ! I would have liked Akane could see that. I'm sure he saw it. Mineko and dit au chauffeur de taxi to go through it. Grandma is great. "Custom is the queen of the world." It is Herodotus. Small fish are pretty, the ends. Yes, they give a sense of depth. Is not it ? Matsuki? Even his work outfits have pink bows. She wants to grip as one of its carp? Stop, Uribo. It's her ! - I've got you ! - Stop annoying me ! This way ! Oriko! What are you doing ? Actually, I... This way. I'm talking to you. Oh no ! Miss! It's dangerous. Stop it, now! Hein ? What's this ? She went where? She ran away ? Health ! Stop, wait! She is fantastic. She flew to the hostel and disappeared. I wonder why. Hello, innkeeper apprentice. Salut, I. You come back to your race? The innkeeper Chamaruya's nice, right? Forgot the race! I will return. Okko! It does not matter. We're busy today. KB, Shuko Ryokan staff will soon arrive. They'll take care of that. Go back to work. Well, ma'am. I'm sorry. You're awfully clumsy and stupid. Shut up ! Yes it is a bit awkward and silly, but ... You're mean ! You're not apprentice innkeeper but rather a clumsy apprentice. clumsy apprentice? The opposite of Matsuki. Matsuki? You know Big Pink Bow? Do not call my sister like that. It's your little sister? Excuse me. You are not hurt? No. Everything is fine. Good. Our young mistress will be relieved. Yes. Thank you. You are the sister of Big Pink Bow? Her name Matsuki. I'm his older sister. I am dead to 7 years. She's older than I am now. So you're the big sister Matsuki? My name is Miyo. I like coming here. This is the perfect place to kill time. To kill time? There is another ghost. Indeed, there is someone else. Hello, innkeeper apprentice. It smells awfully good. It is rude to steal food before a meal. In fact, it's not me ... So they have good taste, these cakes? Oh yes ! It is true ? There was no dust before. - It's this bell? - Yes. I Suzuki. Like motorcycles? M. Suzuki ? Suzuki, the genius of the bell. I am an Imp. It was you who broke the spell, is not it? Is it you who ate my cake? He was very good. Okay. I understand better. I had never encountered greedy genius. Put it back in its box. What? I was not out for ages. You're mean. Thanks to me, a whole bunch of customers come to the hostel. You attracted the most annoying people. I am an mischievous demon. I prefer those who have a strong personality. You're going back to where you came from, I promise. You are a monster ! Attends. Let Suzuki with us. You laugh ? They may be annoying, but it is true that attracts customers. It must surely also attract bad luck. I will do my best to avoid trouble. You promise? Yes. In exchange, you will help me at the inn. But I'm a little devil! This is not a problem. Miyo, I'll also need you. What? Miyo! When you're done, take care of the back yard. At your orders, clumsy apprentice. I love to see her give orders to the ghosts and devils. You seem to have a lot of free time. Yes, I can not help. Miyo enjoying his new activity. It has not been easy for her. At Ryokan Shuko, she had no one to talk to. I know that. A booger! Disgusting! Suzuki does not crush the foam. Pick up fallen leaves. Starts with those who have fallen into the pond. Okko, who addresses are you? It's you, grandma. I'm speaking alone. When you have a minute goes to see Mrs. Suiryo. She has not had lunch yet. If she is sick, we call a doctor. If it has not very hungry, they shall bring a light meal. Ask her what she wants. Excuse me. Mme Suiryo? You sleep ? It smells burnt. There is fire ? Mme Suiryo! No chance. What do you want ? Plan five colors for a balanced diet A fortune teller and ghosts? This is not scientific, but you believe it? I do not you talk about science. This is a client and ... The holidays put you in such a state? Not at all. I want to know if you've seen a ghost. You're not innkeeper apprentice but a clumsy apprentice. You're not the first to tell me. The summer holidays are high season for Hananoyu. All services are rendered to our family. I do the same thing. "Healthy food..." "Healthy food for healthy body." This is our menu. You know what "healthy" means? You know the origin of the word "restaurant"? "Restaurant" has Latin roots. Think of the word "restore". It means "find an optimal state." Healthy food is essential for maintaining a healthy body. One does not go without the other. This balanced menu that mixes cuisines Asian and European, is designed for customers to keep a healthy body eating. I'm editing, so please excuse me. "If you want to be happy, be it!" It's Tolstoy. It really annoys me ... but no one can match Big Pink Bow. Matsuki comes from a very good family and she works hard. According to my father, thanks to their hostel spas are successful. Sorry to keep you waiting. It looks yummy. Yoriko The desserts are the best. I love the smell of bamboo. Yoriko, you've changed. This is my outfit for the summer holidays. Good! I'm going to start too. You start to look like Mineko. Do not come when I change myself. It's good, you've finished. Not bad. Yoriko gave it to me! You have had only bad grades, except in sports. Do not touch! Others still do what they want. I worry about the future of Okko. It's not just the notes in life. We are there for her. Yes, but... Excuse me. Bring me my meal here. Well. Olives and gazpacho jelly. I only ordered olives. As you do not seem very hungry, I brought you something that blends with champagne. Taste it. Thank you. Sorry to disturb you. Not at all. You will put a yukata? No. I lived abroad for a long time. I've never worn. Could you help me put it on? With pleasure ! Ms. Suiryo, you have very small waist. I may have lost a little weight. You must remplumer you. What do you think ? So that's how you wear it. It's nice and light. Good! This is the collection of summer yukata Harunoya! Fantastic ! And now we present you the permanent collection with front taiko knot! Thank you so much. You're welcome. Ko! Ms. Suiryo said it was very good. I'm glad she regained appetite. Is... I might have a cold drink? Mme Suiryo? You are there ? She may be returned to his room. It's you. I scared you ? I do the same thing when I'm alone. It is so nice. Good. This is the fig juice. Thank you. I was thirsty. You want a straw? No need. Unbelievable ! I bring you another. No thanks. It was really good. Thank you. I know few girls working as hard as you. Your parents and your grandmother were well educated you. Not quite. Your grandmother is very strict? She scolds me often. Yet you admire. It is true. Your parents too, surely. Mom, dad and grandma often repeat that the source of Hananoyu rejects no one. It welcomes and heals everyone. What do you do to have fun ? Me ? You papotes with your friends, you disguise yourself or you go out with boys? With boys? I have no boyfriend and I know nothing about fashion. Innkeeper apprentice, are you free tomorrow? To do what ? Shopping. It'll relax. Thank you to accompany me. You're welcome. There is a large shopping center near here. I'd like to go there. These are pretty figurines. But do not tighten so hard. Sorry. Bring me a gift, please. Okko! Where are you going dressed like that? You make me ashamed ! You're gonna get you out without us at your side? Ca Ira. Are you sure ? It is true that all his clothes are identical. A candy, please! Okay. These are my friends. The innkeeper nicknamed you Okko. Can I call you Okko too? Okko? Okko. I am thirsty. Ask Mom to move us tea. Please. It's hot, be careful. Okko, what's wrong? You feel bad ? Uribo ... What is it, Okko? I knew it. Without me, you are lost. I had never seen the sea. You are with me. It always has been. Okko! Are you carsick? I see ... I do not know. Sorry to have forced you to come with me. No, it is for me to apologize. I wasted your time relaxing. I'm sorry. I can not stop thinking that my parents are alive. I know it's weird. Non. Here is your tea. It has cooled a bit Thank you. Let's go Harunoya. I feel better. Let's go shopping. More... I want to go shopping. Jinkan Bungee Jumping! Seiran Kobayashi It's awesome ! I'll get a sunburn. You risk a sunburn. I do not care. And you ? I plug in too! Super ! Me too ! And I also, frankly. Call me Glory. Glory ? My name is Glory Suiryo. The shopping is good medicine! A cure ? Buying clothes is perfect for relaxing. Clothes ! Come here. So ? Do you like it? It's pretty. And that ? Cool ! You are beautiful ! Good... We put that back. Really ? It's your turn now. Looks like an adult. I am not used to that. Continue ! What do you think ? Everything is beautiful. We'll take the shoes also. Well, ma'am. No! Glory, granny will scold me. It's expensive and you are a customer. Shh. I'm not a client. It's just a gift from an old friend. He dumped you! Thank you for this reaction. It comforts me to talk to you. I noticed that you were depressed. He left me because I'm psychic. It's horrible ! This is not a valid reason. This is not the only one. I gave too much to clairvoyance. We were compatible. It was no doubt. We could not see often, but I believe in our future. Yet he left me. That day should have been my lucky day. It will be fine. You are beautiful, kind and cool! You must have all full of admirers. Drop clairvoyance. Next time will be right. Usually it's me who gives a smile to people. Merci, Okko. If one day you're around, and see me. Clairvoyance is my vocation. I need to go back to work. Okko, I absolutely do not recognize you! Uribo! Miyo! You are there ? What sh ... Dad Akane sent to the hostel. So grandma already seen. Look! That's great. The description is very detailed. It is true ? We will receive lots of guests. I did not know Akane's father wrote for this magazine. He nicknamed you Okko. It does not use your real name. It is not serious. I Okko. Okay, Okko. I would like a Mont Blanc. What are you talking about ? I brought these two clients. It is the least we ... I will be late ! Really? Hey, Okko! What is happening ? She does not see us? She was too happy. It started. What do you mean ? Suzuki, what are you saying? Soon she will no longer see you both. You begin again to talk nonsense! He may be right. Sometimes I feel qu'Okko does not see us. Do not be distracted by your partner, Oriko. Focus on dance. Excuse me. 'S try again again. You're not taking this seriously, so you dance badly. I take that very seriously. Where is the innkeeper apprentice? It will happen soon. - That Okko! - Sorry for the waiting. Hold. - It's cute ! - It is an "open-air bath". The cake looks just like that. Excuse me. Here for you. You too, you're cute, Okko. You will sign me an autograph? No I can not... To me too ! Everything is in order. Thank you. We do the rest. Go and rest now. Where is Grandma? She is already in bed. Uribo? Miyo? Suzuki ? Uribo? Miyo? Sorry ! Oriko, I advise you to give up. You can not go on like this. This Shinto dance reflects the history of Hananoyu. It is very important. I know it. It does not seem like it. She will not give up. You have been selected as future innkeepers. This job might no longer exist. Matsuki! What do you mean ? You understand nothing ? How to run an inn where guests occupy the managers? You speak of our own? There is only one host and your grandmother should also serve customers. Yes, it is the landlord. That's true, but it is no longer young. Customers will not dare ask an elderly lady to carry heavy loads. I'm taking care of it. It's the same with a child. The closure of a hostel would be a shame for Hananoyu. A real shame! Therefore you should give up. Whatever ! We run things our way. I think it is not good. Listen, you two ... Let's talk about you? You're proud, but your staff takes care of everything. What do you know about that ? Let! Your work clothes have pink bows. It's ridiculous ! You said "pink bow!" Apprentice awkward! Yes, sort of big pink bow! - Apprentice awkward! - Big Pink Bow! Oh is that ... Hey, Okko! I'm here. Uribo! You were gone where? You manage to see me? - You're not allowed to do. - You've seen it all? Mineko will help. Hurry back. Yes I know. It is you who hold me, Uribo. - What's this ? - Stopped ! The poor. Fire! The stone did not fall. Miyo! Okko! Poor little. You like lizards. Shota! Papa ! You walk too fast. You stay in Harunoya? Yes. Here Mr. Kise and his family. Welcome. We have arrived. What is it ? you are Okko! Thank you. Welcome. The entrance is very pretty. Welcome, Shota. Do you know my name ? You're like in the journal. Come here. She look older in the photo. Listening, I ordered a meal low in salt and calories. That was delicious. I ate it all. I talk to dad. Excuse me. Okko! You sit on your father's lap. You are lucky ! You can also rid my plate. Stopped. Looks like the hospital food. Please excuse us. I'll see if we can cook anything. It is useless. Now I can travel with my family. I want to eat a hearty meal. It's impossible ! You've removed a kidney and pancreas. No pancreas. Remember the doctor's words. I wish he had not enjoyed his meal. It's not your fault. - No. - Not at all. Without the use of salt and fat, it is difficult to prepare a hearty meal. I have to invent healthy recipes for a healthy body. Matsuki could help us. What's wrong ? I'm going to Shuko Ryokan for advice. - Attends, Okko. - Okko ! You go to Big Pink Bow? You will catch cold, dressed like that. It will be fine. Ouch! Why is everything against me? The closure of a hostel would be a shame for Hananoyu. Okko! This way. Miyo? That's wonderful. How beautiful ! It will appeal to many customers. Yes, but the plants should rest for the night. Extinguish all an hour early and see what happens. I agree with you. There is someone. This is the Teenage innkeeper Harunoya. What she's doing out in the cold like this? The clumsy apprentice arrives. Over here, please. - It is the second floor. - Well. Thank you. Matsuki? What do you want ? I'm busy. Miyo ... So ? What do you want ? I wanted to apologize for earlier. I was distracted during rehearsal. You did not entirely wrong. So what ? I need your help, Matsuki. I want to please a customer. You really have no dignity? Of course yes ! But satisfying customers is more important. You'd do the exact same thing. I'm not so sure. If Harunoya farm, it would be a shame for Hananoyu. According to you, there are fewer calories in porridge or roasted meat? - In the boiled meat. - No, it is better to roast. It melts the fat. If you do grill 100 g of meat, you lose 5 g of fat, which is 45 calories. If you brushed with salt water over the meat with a brush or if you sprayed on the food, the taste will be much better. The most important are the ingredients. Matsuki! "If you can dream it, you can do it." By Walt Disney. Do your best. Matsuki, I do not know what to say. You're great. Thank you so much ! Suzuki ! Okko, our paths will soon separate. What? The day of the festival, and Miyo Uribo will leave this world and go to heaven. What do you mean ? Beef Hananoyu! It does not have a price. It might work. The notes will save me time. Thank you, innkeeper apprentice. Trust me. Do your best. Everything depends on you. Roger, miss! Harunoya! It's good and seasoned as I like. It was slathered with salt water and passed twice in the oven. He ate it all. It was cooked in cherry wood. - Do not tell me you want sake. - You do not have the right. I want to drink sake. - He said it. - We have some. Hold. Rice with mushrooms cooked in sake. All the alcohol has evaporated. Smells good sake. - Delicious ! - Great ! What is it, ma'am? There is a problem with the bill? No, not at all, but ... tofu stew with sweet potatoes and soy milk. It took very little salt and seasoned with spices. - This is a curry! - Good guess. Its good. Mr. Kise was delighted. You are excellent, Ko. It was a team effort. - Room "Azalea", main course! - Very well. Steakhouse rest Hananoyu. Eat it with balsamic sauce and wasabi. - I eat a steak. Unbelievable ! - It smells good. It is delicious. It's exquisite. Taste. Okay. And here to complement the dish. Rice cooked in red wine, accompanied by mushrooms and vinegar. It's a delight. Is not it ? Thank you for putting up with my temper, young lady. You're welcome. I'm glad we could accommodate you. Its good. Unbelievable ! He fell asleep. Relax at the spa with my family, eat excellent food ... I am happy to be alive. He had an accident in March and was hospitalized until recently. An accident ? He remained in a coma for months. I thought he was not going to get by. I understand better. Two cars are struck in front of me. I pointed to avoid them and I landed in the opposite lane. He hit a vehicle against the grain. A family was in that car. My only consolation is that their only daughter survived and was not injured. No... It is ... No... I want to go back home. Sorry not to be by your side. Dad mom... We're both glad you're alive. We no longer belong to this world. To you to become the best innkeeper ever. No... Dad mom ! Do not leave me alone. You are not alone. It is true. No ! Dad mom ! Do not leave me! Young lady ! Uribo! Miyo! Okko! Come see me. Do not leave me alone. Miyo, attends! Okko! I had a bad feeling and I felt I had to come back. Your parents... Uribo et Miyo ... It must have been very hard. Thank you for Thee entrusted to me. To be alone... But you, Okko, you're not alone. Glory... Your parents are watching over you. I will not be a good landlord if I cry like a baby. Matsuki. Sorry for the inconvenience, Matsuki. You're welcome. No ! Shota! I want to stay here. Do not be stubborn and put on your shoes. Sorry, Shota. Dad can not be here. Let's go. So I'll stay alone. You can leave. It's Okko! Shota! Do I stay here? Yes you can. Rest. Okay. Leave it to me, Oriko. Young lady, I have no words. Excuse me. On and goes, Shota. Wait. You're welcome. Stay with us. Do not worry, Oriko. We will accommodate them. My parents said ... Grandma also often says. The source Hananoyu is a gift of the gods. She rejects no one. It welcomes and heals everyone. So ... Stay as long as you like. Please ! Thank you, young lady, but it's too hard for me. You are the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Seki, who died because of me. You are well Oriko? No, here I am ... Apprentice innkeeper Harunoya. Okko. Okko! It is extraordinary. That is true. Snow ! Let's go all inside. It's snowing. I stay too? Yes of course. Let's go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come on, darling. Papa. You been here before? Yes. Apprentice innkeeper Harunoya, you are no longer a clumsy apprentice. It is a mysterious place. Effectively. One day you told me about a ghost. Yes. I must admit that I've heard her voice. When I made a mistake, or when a customer scolded me. "Do your best, Matsuki." "You'll get there, Matsuki." I had an older sister. She died before I was born. I imagined that it was her voice. I would have liked to meet her. Matsuki. Well, let's go. I feel dreaming listening Mineko play the koto. The power of this sanctuary is at its peak today! We really should separate? We'll see each other again. The day of reincarnation. We will go to Harunoya. And we will meet the adult person that you will become. Do I get to recognize you? Yes. Of course. I look forward. I'll eat the cake in "open-air bath". I bathe in the source. I wish this time never stops. - Okko! - Okko! Uribo! Miyo! Adaptation : Cristina Fernandez Subtitling OTAKUGOD KHMER 2019
