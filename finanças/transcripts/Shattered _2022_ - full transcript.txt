Hey, Jamie. Hi, Chris. How you doing with all this wind? House is still standing. Yeah, we had a lot of thunder and lightning over here. Of course, Willow loved it. Yeah, she's fearless, that kid. Well, the reason I'm calling... I still haven't signed the divorce and alimony papers yet. Any particular reason? Uh... I guess it just feels so, um... so final. Well, it is final. I should have fought harder to keep us together, Jamie. - But you didn't. The company came first. - I sold the company. That wasn't for us. You did that for the money, and you know it. Right. Punishment time. I'm moving on, Chris, and you need to do the same. Tell Kendall I'll get it done. Thank you. I miss Daddy. I know, baby. I miss him, too. Why don't you love him anymore? I do. Of course I do. You know, sometimes when you are... not with somebody, doesn't mean you stop loving them. And anyway, we both love you very, very much. You know that, right? Okay, sweet pea. Mwah. Hey! Do you know anything about wine? A little. I'm helpless here. I could really use a recommendation. Any special occasion? Yeah, I had an amazingly shitty day. Ah, so basically you're looking for a bottle to kill before you pass out. You read my mind. Well, you can't go wrong with a Nebbiolo. And here it is. Yeah. Oh, wow. Thanks, you're a lifesaver. I'm Chris. Sky. Oh, shit! - You okay? - My Uber just canceled. I'm parked right over there. You want a ride? I thought she'd be passed out by now. Who? My roommate, Loony Lisa. We had a big fight, so I left. I really don't want to get back into it, because she can get kind of crazy. I don't live far from here. You can come over to mine. We can hang out. I can drop you back off when she goes to sleep. It's okay. Thanks. Better go in and get this over with. Bye. No, I have no fucking clue where she went! Offer still stands. It's dark out here. You afraid of the dark? No. I love the dark. House sitting for your parents? No. It's mine. You're like a hermit up here. Uh, kind of, yeah. But that's the way I like it. Should I let it breathe? I say pour it. Thank you. To... sudden adventures. To sudden adventures. Mmm. What's the verdict? - It's tasty. - Mm. Thank you. So, Chris, what do you do for a living? Uh, I'm sort of retired, actually. You're a little young for that, aren't you? Junior year at MIT, I inherited some money. I got into mobile apps, games, banking, order tracking. Uh, GPS and location-based services. But the breakout was this guy. Watch Dog Home Security app. Google Play made me an offer I couldn't refuse, and now here I am, trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. How about you? I modeled in LA for a couple of years, print and runway. But I hated just being a body in clothes. A plastic manikin. So I came here on an assignment. Decided to stay, hang around and see if I couldn't find something more fulfilling. - Did you? - No. That's why I work as one of those cocktail waitresses at the Kitty Warren bar. Huh. Do you always do your grocery shopping after midnight? Mm-hmm. Pretty much, yeah. You don't like people? Every so often I meet one I like. I think I should've gotten us a second bottle. Ah. Well... - Let me show you something. - Okay. I'm not just a tech nerd... - I'm also a wine nerd. - Wow! What do you like? Hm. Something rare, extremely expensive. You kind of saved me tonight. Oh, yeah? From, uh... Loony Lisa? Yeah. Never move in with a total stranger, right? Shit! What time is it? Uh, it's just after 2:15. You should probably run me back home. Hopefully, Lisa's zonked out in an opiate coma by now. You sure you want to go back there? No. But... what's the alternative? You could stay. Ah... Walk of shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. - I waited up all fucking night. - I told you not to. No call? No text? Where were you? - Were you in my room again? - This is my place! You're a fucking guest here! You know, maybe you should go, right? Like, pack your shit and go? - Lisa, let's talk about this later, okay? - Right? Yeah. What, you were just gonna fucking call it? Yeah? You're gonna get your shit and go? Fuck! Please, Sky! No, no, no, no. I didn't mean it. No, please, Lisa, stay as long as you like. Please, just open the fucking door. All right. All right, honey. Time to go to bed. Turn off the light. - Daddy? - Hmm? Remember when we were at the park and I got lost? - Yeah. - I was so worried that I was never going to see you again. And then you found me, and you promised that you'd never leave me alone. - Remember, Daddy? - Yeah, of course, baby. Hi. You didn't leave any contact information at my place. And I figured showing up at your apartment, knocking on your front door would have been a little, uh... Stalker-like? Yeah. And showing up at my place of work isn't? - And yet... - What? Well, you didn't exactly seem surprised or disappointed to see me. Okay. Guess I was hoping a little. You know, don't get too excited. I'm only here 'cause my ex-wife told me to move on with my life. I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's just... What? Nothing. I'm glad you wanted to see me. But... I've got an admission to make. Chris, I'm what they call... damaged goods. What are you talking about? You're great. Back in the restaurant, I lied to you about my family. What, the whole Gypsy thing? Truth is I don't have a family. I never had a family. It was always just me. From the age of six, I was in and out of foster homes. So many, I can't even remember. And believe me, I don't want to remember most of them. On every level, my childhood was a fucking nightmare. I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. I just felt like you deserved the truth. I don't like starting with lies. Well, thank you... and my turn. My childhood wasn't much better. I mean, I had parents... but they weren't really there for me. My ex-wife used to say that's why I was so obsessed with security. - But I'm sick of being cautious. - Good. What the fuck? Hey! Yeah, you! Hey! Get away from my car, man. We don't want any problem. Just take off, all right? What you gonna do? Have the lady protect you? Huh? All right, forget it. Forget it. How about I kill you and I fuck your hot girlfriend, huh? - Go fuck yourself! - Sky. - I kill you, bitch! - Go on, stay back! - Ow! - Wait, wait, wait, wait! God! Couch is fine. Thanks. The nurse from the private care service shows up at 5:00. I'm sorry. Are you okay? It's fine. - It's fine. - Can I help you? - It's okay. I'm all right. - What do you need, huh? Here, here. Thanks for, uh, bringing me back and hanging around. It's the least I could do. I mean, it's my fault. - If I hadn't told that punk to go fuck himself... - Hey. It sucks. It's not forever. Right? Is there anything I can get you? - I feel really bad. - Good. Maybe you'll feel guilty enough to visit me every now and then. I bet I could take better care of you than some hatchet-faced nurse. How do you know she's hatchet-faced? Pretty sure it's part of the job description. Mm. So, you wanna be my nurse... and take care of me? Why not? Mm. What are your qualifications? Well, I can fix a mean omelet. - I can cook for you. - Mm-hm. Make sure you take your meds. - Shop, run errands. - Escape your crazy roommate. Yeah. That too. And I'm willing to have sex with my patient. Well, in that case, you're hired. All right, I'll call the rent-a-nurse agency. You take the Range, head down the hill, - bring back your stuff. - Okay. Wait. If you're asleep, how do I get back in? Uh, guess you'll need the codes. Fuck! The earth's atmosphere makes the male aliens sterile, so, in order to reproduce, the female aliens have gotta mate with human males. However, the female aliens' reproductive organs are quite large and only extremely well-endowed human... You look like a puppy waiting for its owner to come home. Leave me alone, Ronald. - You were happier before. - What? Before Sky moved in. That's none of your business. Well, actually, it is, 'cause I'm not just your landlord, I'm your friend. Maybe your only real friend. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, Ronald, you're just jealous. I bet you haven't been in a relationship since... never. - When you didn't come home... - Let's talk about that inside. Friendly reminder, ladies. You're two weeks behind on the rent again. I'd hate to have to evict you. Ronald, if you evict us, you won't be able to spy on us in our bikinis anymore. You know what, Sky, don't play games with me. I'm not the kind of man you want to trifle with. Yeah. What the fuck? You're not gonna say anything? Explain where the fuck you were all night? - It's for the best. - It's for the fucking best? - Well, I know things, Sky. - You don't know anything. - Oh, I don't know anything? - Yeah. Don't I? Huh? Lisa, come here. Hey, hey. You're right. I do owe you an explanation. Sky, if you leave me, I'll die. I know. Chris. Wake up. Wake up, you sleepyhead. - Mm. - How's my patient? Better now that his nurse is here. Did you get your stuff? Mm-hm. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. You're a little hot. Well, so are you. Can you blame me? God, I love the taste of you. You need your rest. I won't bother you. Oh, no, no, no, bother me. Bother me. Hey, help me out, would you? I think I overdid it a little bit. - How's your pain? - Feels like the whole right side of my body's gonna fall off. Take this. Close your eyes and go to dreamland. Hey, Sky. Yeah? I love you. It's the drugs. Yeah, well, maybe you should take some. See if you feel the same way. I already do. It scares the hell out of me. Me, too. What are we going to do? Live happily ever after. Lisa! Lisa, it's Ronald. I needed to talk to you about the rent. Lisa, I'm gonna open up. You don't give me any choice. Lisa! Lisa. Are you decent? Hope not. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa? Chris. Lisa was my tenant for over eight years. I mean, sweet kid. She... Well, she was like a daughter to me. Any reason to think it wasn't a suicide? No. She was despondent. You know, her-her roommate had left her. You know, when I say roommate, I mean in the Greek sense. Yeah, uh, the roommate, Skyler Webb. You ever see an actual ID to verify that was her real name? No. Why? Because we have no record of a Sky or Skyler Webb in any of our databases. Are you kidding? I knew there was something shady about... You gotta be shitting me. Who the fuck called them, huh? - Who the fuck called the press? - Excuse me, sir. - Hello. - Could you tell us... Excuse me, Detective. Um, hi. My name is Ronald Graham, I'm the manager of this motel, and I'd like to make a brief statement now, which I will read, and then I'll answer any questions. Now, this-this property was built by my parents in 1947, - and it was used as... - Excuse me, sir. Get her out of here! Lady, walk away! - Sir... - Walk away, right now. Assholes. Locusts. Hey, Chris. I'm following up on the signature thing. Yeah, um... Look, I'm a little out of it right now. Can we... Can we talk later? Why? What's wrong? I had a dumb accident. Broke my leg. - Oh, God. - Yeah. Um, no permanent damage, but I won't be running marathons for the next few weeks. I'm so sorry. Would it cheer you up to see Willow? She's been asking about you, and I can drive her over, let's say, on Friday morning? Yeah. Yeah, do that. She can sign her name on my cast, and, um, you can pick up the papers at the same time. That sounds good. Um, are you sure you're okay? Is someone taking care of you? I hired a private care nurse. That must be odd, having a stranger in your house. That's a big thing for you. Actually, we're doing fine. Talk later. Hey, Sky? Sky! Sky? Shit! Can't say I blame you. Sorry. I was just... Uh, I was obviously snooping. Don't feel guilty. Hey, if I was in your place, I'd do the same. Nobody's who they say they are. Maybe you're not who you say you are. Dry my back, please. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. All good children go to heaven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. All good children go to heaven. Sky? What the hell? Where the fuck did I put it? What? Lisa. Hey! I got fried chicken. You like chicken, right? - Yeah, sure. - Good 'cause I got a lot. I don't know about you, but I'm starving. - I thought models didn't eat. - Oh, that's a lie. We eat like truck drivers. Anyways, I'm not a model anymore. I'm a private care nurse. You smell that? You see my phone? I'm sure it's around here somewhere. I'll help you find it after we eat. Here. Dig in, Chris. Can I use your phone? Sure. After we eat. Eat. Chris, what's wrong? Uh... Sky, I, um... I saw something... on the news. Okay. Was it something good or something bad? It's your roommate... Lisa. What about her? She died. Sky, you should probably contact the police. That would be stupid of me. Why? Because I'm the one who killed her. This is the best chicken. No kidding. Here, have some. You killed her? Had to. Sky, if this is some sort of joke, it's not fucking funny. It's no joke, Chris. Lisa wasn't a bad roommate. I mean, she wasn't even a bad lover. But on the downside, she had some jealousy issues, and she was too nosey. But she had the apartment. The perfect place to watch you from. - Watch me? - For the last two months. I do my homework, Chris. I know everything that happens around here. Like how your gardener and cleaning lady won't be here for another six days. How you never get visitors. Exact times you sleep, eat, shit, piss, swim and work out. When and where you do your groceries. Where to accidentally bump into you. All of this was some sort of con job? A set-up? Now you're catching on. Get out of my house. Get the fuck out of my house! Naturally, you're angry and confused. Who wouldn't be? Look what I found. Give that back! Sorry, lover. Honeymoon's over. Oh, Jesus. Hm. Should be worth a few bucks. Jesus. Oh... Wow. Hot yoga. Jesus. One, two, three, and stretch. One, two, three, and stretch. Stay right there... don't move a muscle. Down to business. I'm gonna ask you some questions. Why are you doing this? Because you're rich and you have things I want. Fuck you! You lying fucking bitch! I'm gonna ask you some questions. You think I'm gonna help you steal my life? - That's what you are, right? - Hm? A goddamn identity thief. It'll go better if you cooperate. I fucking hate you! I'm not telling you jack shit! Yeah, I thought you might be obstinate... so I picked up this little persuader in the torture aisle at the hardware store. - It's scary, right? - Oh, fuck! I need all your passwords and security codes. Go fuck yourself. Okay. What's your mother's maiden name? - Huh? - Oh, fuck! Mother's maiden name. Oh... Same time tomorrow. No fucking way. Morning, sunshine. All better now? I didn't want to hurt you last night... but I needed you to know how serious I am. Sky... Is that even your real name? No... This morning, thanks to the information you gave me, I took the easy stuff. But in this next phase, this is where I'm gonna need your fullest cooperation. We have some Zoom calls to make to your bankers and brokers to liquidate your stock, to fund my new company: SkyCo. SkyCo. That means I can't have you looking like this. Sky, you are a very, very naughty girl. Don't want to cut you. Okay, I'm gonna give you that one. But I need you to know why you have to cooperate. What's at stake. No, please don't hurt them. Please don't hurt them. Please, please, please... I'm hoping I won't have to. I think five is the cutest age. Don't you? - How's the knee, dude? - Fuck you! I do good work, don't I? Leave him alone, Ki-Ju. We've got business. I know you'll give me your best price for the art and the wine collection. Anything for you, Sky. We'll pay top dollar for the rugs and furniture, too. Everything goes, lover boy. I'm stripping you down to the studs. You know, I always wondered what one of these places was like inside. When you grow up in the flats, you're always looking up at the house on the hill and wondering. Well, now I know. Mystery solved. I waited for her to leave, Sky or Sly or Bi. Whatever it is she calls herself. I always knew she was some kind of scammer. You know, people like you, you always think that people seek you out because you're interesting. No. People seek you out because you're rich. I looked this property up on Google Earth and I did an owner search. Apparently, there is a Christopher Decker who bought it for 3.5 million bucks, in cash. Would that be you by any chance? And this same guy sold his internet company to some chucklehead for millions of dollars. And now, you're just what we need, another rich tech dork. Yeah, tell me your story. Call the police before she comes back! She's a fucking killer! Call the police! Why are you just standing there? Help me! Fucking help me! She might already know you're here! Money? Money. You want money. Yeah? - Some kind of rescue fee? - That's the least you could do, I would say. Okay. Whatever you want, just get this fucking tape off me and call the police. - I want a hundred grand. - A hundred grand, okay. Just fucking free me. Okay, well, that was too fucking easy, so now I want 200 grand. Okay, two hundred, three hundred, whatever! Just fucking help me! Help me! You're on layaway until I get the cash, buster. I don't keep that kind of cash in the house. Oh, you don't? What do you keep in the house? A watch collection? Jewelry? - Artwork? - What you fucking talking about? Who is that? - That's a Picasso. - Are you shitting me? Wow. What's that worth? Um... Six or seven million. Six or seven million? - And it's yours. - It certainly is. Okay. Okay. It's a deal, right? And now I'll get the tape off you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Jesus. Looks like she did a pretty fucking good job though. Almost like she's done it before. Forget the tape. Call the police. No, first me and my painting get the fuck out of here, then you call whoever you... No, she took my phone. She ripped out the landlines. Use your phone. What's that? She's back. Sky? You need to call the police now. Give-give me your phone. I told you, she ripped out all the land lines! - You don't have a phone? - Fuck no! It causes brain cancer! You haven't heard of 5G, tech wiz? I'm sorry. You probably got your hopes up, right? Stay back! I'm not afraid to use this. I mean it! Yeah. How did you find me? - Your telescope. - Ah, shit. Makes me wonder who was stupider? Me for leaving the telescope, or you, Ronald McDonald, for showing up here all by yourself. Listen, I have no idea what you two are up to, and I don't want to know. And I'm not gonna tell anyone. You just let me go. - Hm. - Stay back. Hey, Ronald. That's your name, right? - Kill her. - "Kill her"? Stab her, goddamnit. Fucking stab her! Hey! Hey! Hey! No! No, no, no! - Okay. - Fuck! Why don't you watch a little TV while I show our guest around? - Fuck you! - Oh, Ronald! Fuck! Ronald? Fuck! Hi, there. Please. Please. It's worth so much money! I won't tell a soul. Please. Please, let me go. Jesus Christ! You okay? - Hey! - Please. Please. Hey, get me out of here! All right. All right. Okay. You're okay. There's a woman trying to kill me. We have to get out of here right now. Where? Where? Where? I don't see any woman. All right. She's not gonna touch you. I got you. I got you, pal. You're safe. - She's coming. - There's no one coming. She's gonna fucking kill you! - Oh, fuck! - Hey! Breathe, breathe. Relax, relax. - We have to go. - We're gonna go. Hey, look, man! There's no woman! You're safe! Come on. I got you. You all right? All right. I'm gonna get you out of here. - Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. - You say a woman's trying to kill you? - Is she your wife? - No, no, we need to call the police. - Have you got a phone? - Yeah, of course I got a phone, man. - Hold on. - Fuck! Call 911. Tell them my name is Christopher Decker. I live at 4522 Ridgeline Drive. All right. It's ringing. Yeah. Hello. Police emergency. Yeah. Listen, I got a kid here, Christopher... Hold on, hold on. You tell them. You tell them. - Hello? - Please state the nature of your emergency. My name is Christopher Decker! I live in 4522 Ridgeline Drive! There's a woman in my house, she's imprisoned me against my will. She's trying to steal my identity. She wants to kill me. She-she already killed a guy with a fucking sword! - What? - Where are you now, sir? - Are you safe? - Yeah, yeah. I'm in a car. - I'm heading... - Yeah. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! - Mr. Decker, sir. Are you there? I need you to stay on the line. You should have seen the look on your face. Man, it was priceless. Don't try that again. Oh, wow. Wow. That's a lot of wood. Huh. - Well, who'd you kill? - My landlord. Oh. That's a good way to save on rent. I'm gonna go wash off. I'm gonna get acquainted with our friend, Chris. The two men in my life. Play nice. I really like your lifestyle. I mean, at least what's left of it. And you are? I am Sky's stepfather. It's crazy, right? When she was 14, I married her mother. And a couple of months later, her mother passed... let's just say unexpectedly. So ever since then it's been me and Sky, together, against the world. That's nice stuff. You know, even then she was... she was special. I don't have to tell you that. So I nurtured it, and I trained her... in the fine art of deception and identity theft. That's sickening. Huh. I just brought out the girl's true nature, and trust me, Sky was a natural. Especially when it came to seducing young, lonely guys like you. And that's justification for stealing my life, right? Well... don't think of it as stealing. Think of it as giving back. - "Giving back." - Yeah, you're a successful guy! Successful rich guy, aren't you, Chris? Huh? You didn't get it all on your own, did you? Did you? Cracks me up, guys like you think you got it 'cause you're so smart. Bullshit. That's not why you got this! Lot of people are smart! What about the rest of us? Huh? Down there! Look! Down there! You see them, Chris? You see them? Because I guarantee they see you. Sitting up here all protected. Safe in your big fortress. Let me tell you something... Chris. While you're looking down at them, they're looking up at you. Those hungry eyes. Don't you feel it? Watching. Waiting till the day they come up here and they take all your shit from you. You done? Am I done? You can't twist this into socio-political bullshit. I don't look down on them. Just you. You and Sky are thieves. You're just fucking killers. You could've done this to anybody. A thousand other people. Why did you have to steal my life? 'Cause you weren't using it! Chris. Hey. I'm sorry, I had to feed the wolf. Don't tell him I said so, but... he's not half the lover you are. Every word that comes out of your mouth is a lie. Let's not fight. Honestly? I'll be sorry to leave this place. It really was nice for a while. Like living in an alternative universe. Especially those first early days when we were so deeply in love. You could have had it all. What? I would have given it to you. You didn't have to take it. This. All of it. Us. Anything you wanted. I loved you, Sky. It's a nice dream. But that's all it is, Chris. A dream. But why are you still here? You've taken everything from me. You've bled me dry. You're such a shitty liar. Just shows in your eyes. You've taken... everything. Except for those bearer bonds. Slipped your mind, did it? Fourteen million dollars in bearer bonds, in a safe deposit box in the main branch of American Bank. It's just the liquid bulk of your fortune... and you forgot to tell me. Did you really think I didn't know? I even have the key to your box. I found it in your floor safe. That's why you haven't killed me yet. Isn't it? Hm? The biometric scanner at the bank. My thumb print. You can't get into the vault without my thumb print. Very true. I don't care what you do to me. I'm not coming with you. No, you're not. Looks like Daddy has company. Can I go get Leo the Lion from my room? Sure, sweetie. Daddy! Chris! What's going on here? Willow? Willow, I said come here right now! Willow! Lookie what I found. - I'm sorry, you are? - I'm Sky, Chris's nurse. This little cupcake must be Willow. - Could you put me down, please? - No, I can't. You're just too scrumptious and I might just eat you up. Yeah. Put my daughter down, please. Okay, the mother lion thing. I get it. Come here. Good girl. Um, Chris didn't tell me you were coming. - Yeah. Where is Chris? - He's sleeping. Would you mind waking him up? I don't think that's a good idea. He had a very bad night. Maybe you should just come back another time. Are you going to get Chris, or do you want me to call the police? Whoa, there's no reason to get the police involved. Chris, your wife and daughter are here to see you. Daddy! No hug for Daddy? Who are you people? Where's Chris? He's right here. - Oh, my God! - Don't try anything funny. - Chris! Chris... - Jamie? Yeah, it's me. It's me, I'm here. Daddy! Who are these people? What do they want? Everything. You seem different on this one. - What's going on with you? - Nothing. Just focus on getting the bonds. It's so quiet. Daddy, you try it. I can't, baby. Daddy hurt his hand. But we can play heads or tails. - Heads. - Heads. That's a good choice. Look. - What? - The vent. It's not big enough for one of us, but... - I could do it. - Okay, baby, we're gonna play a fun game, okay? No, absolutely not. No, it's too dangerous. - She's not going... - Jamie! These people are monsters. If we don't escape before they get back, they'll... We have to get out. - You must be Mr. and Mrs. Decker. - Hey. I'm the vault officer, Austin Briggs. Oh, sorry. All right, sweetheart, you're going to get us out of here and then... we're going to get some ice cream, okay? - Daddy, too? - Yes, yes. Daddy, too. Oh, yeah. Chocolate chip. Come here. Okay, it's the panel next to the door. You remember the code? - What's the code? - 0811, my birthday. That's right, your birthday. You can do this, right? I know you can. Because you're so brave and strong and smart. Oh, I love you so much. We'll just need your thumb print, Mr. Decker. Oh, of course. Hope it won't be too painful. No pain, no gain. Be brave for me, okay, baby? Remember, once you're outside, go to the deck in the front of the house, okay. We'll be right here, okay. You got this, Willow! Huh. Seems it's not reading the heat signature. Must be the... try that again. Maybe my hand's cold from the cast. Just keep going. You're doing so well. Don't be scared, all right? I should probably call someone. No, no. Hold on one second. Wait-wait. There you go. - There you go. - Ah! Excellent. - Yeah. Yeah. - Shall we go inside? - What did they do to you? - They cut off my thumb. For the, um, the fingerprint scanner at the bank. They're after the fucking bearer bonds in the safe deposit box. Oh, shit. Okay. I'll be outside. Just push the call button when you're ready to leave. - Thank you. - Thank you, Mr. Briggs. You've been an angel. - The bearer bonds... - What? They aren't there. My lawyer told me to take them. He said... Well, he said in case we couldn't agree on support that the bonds would give me leverage. You thought I was going to screw you over? No. I'm sorry. - Where are they now? - Still at the bank. I just put them in another box. Jamie, that means they're coming back. Oh, my God! Willow! Your fucking boyfriend fucked us! Check the house. Son of a bitch. The kid is loose! - Fucking kid is loose! - Fuck! You see Chris, you kill him. We find the wife... we get the bonds. Fucking cut me? I'm fucking bleeding! - Motherfucker. - Where's Jamie? Shoot him. He cut me. - Where's Jamie? - Shoot him! He cut me! Shoot him! What are you waiting for? I said shoot him! Shoot that motherfucker! You pussy! - Shoot him! - Enough! You want the fucking key? I've got it. Come and get it. Chris. Time to kiss and make up? Or is it really too late for us? Jamie! Willow! Okay... Let's get out of here. Chris... - Shut up. - Chris. Margaret. What? Margaret. My... my real name... is Margaret.
