Yes, this morning I saw, the man with a red hair band, and the girl who walked too much. When kowtowing, you shouldn’t wear headgear. As for the steps to take, that depends on the incantation. For incantations like this, It’s 7 or 7 steps. If you’ve made a wish, just follow the Lama’s instructions. Step as you wish. The key is when you kowtow, have a pious heart. A pilgrimage is for the sake of others. To wish humanity good health and happiness. And to wish yourselves good health and happiness. That is how you kowtow, Yes. Grandpa, repairing the plough? Yes. Ploughing the field tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow! How about we help? Okay! So much snow last night! Snow is good. Very good. With moist soil, the barley will grow fast. Yes. In my hometown, we should be ploughing too. Everyone dresses up for it. We bring food, wine, meat and yak butter. It’s more ceremonious than here. Yes. When I was the head of the village, we’d plough for 2 or 3 days, we’d bring food and burn incense. It was very lively. Young people today, I don’t know why they rush, they overwork the yaks. And this is now the norm. True! It’s all machines nowadays. The young people are in charge now. Yes. Thanks to everyone! Come drink some barley wine! It’s okay, Grandpa. Thanks, it’s good. It’s very good, thanks. Have a drink. I don’t drink. He doesn’t drink, Grandpa. Why? He quit. He was a butcher. And now he is sober. He is kowtowing to Lhasa to redeem his past sins.

How unlucky I am! The rocks hit my leg. Yes. Sometimes when I stop and think, God is very unfair. Building the house last year, the truck turned over, two died, and two were injured. I paid so much in compensation. I’m responsible for all the family debt. Yes. When my grandfather was alive, he never did anything bad, neither did my father! Same for me! I just don’t understand why this happened. The three of us, embarked on this pilgrimage, for the two dead men, and to wish health and happiness to other. Just remember you’re not alone, many encounter similar hardships, but your attitude is admirable. Your leg is injured, let’s rest for a couple of days. Once you recover, we can continue wholeheartedly. When you kowtow, keep others’ wellbeing in mind. Yes. Let’s do the invocation. Yes. It’s getting hot. Tomorrow we’ll wear lighter clothes. Okay.

I’m from Ya’an, Sichuan, Honhyuan County, Aba Prefecture. Good. How long have you kowtowed? 7 months and 17 or 18 days. Good! Why don’t you let the donkey pull the cart? The donkey, only when the road is too step for her, then we use the donkey. The donkey is very dear to her, when the road is easy, she pulls the cart herself. Yes. We see the donkey as our family. Together, we go through thick and thin. When we get to Lhasa, we’ll take him strolling, around the Potala Palace and the Jokhang Temple. We’ll cut some of his fur, and put it before the statue of Buddha Shakjamuni. Then we’ll pray for him. If he always pulls the cart, he’ll be exhausted. That’s very nice of you. Yes. Want some tsampa for the donkey? We have some. Good, thanks. I won’t need a lot. If you insist, I’ll just take these. You can take these. Okay, thanks. Put the tsampa there. Oh, put it on top.

The total is? 20 each, 600 for 30 pairs. Yeah? Yes. Water everywhere! What now? What should we do? It should be fine. How about we kowtow through it? Let’s do it! There was once a big mountain, where a Lama practiced. There was also a hunter from a poor family, he hunted to support his wife and children. Each hunt, he gave two deer to the Lama. When there were no more deer, on this side of the mountain, the hunter flew over a cliff, to hunt on the other side. The Lama thought, he has many sins, even he can fly over the mountain. I, after years of spiritual practice, can certainly fly over with ease. Yet he ended up falling into the water. What matters most is your heart! We have kowtowed all this way. If your forehead hurts, it reflects piety in your heart and kindness. Wangdui already has a bump on his head, You see my head. as do I. You’re not alone. What is it? There’s a bug. Are you all right, brother? Are you ok? Are you ok? Is your arm ok? It’s fine. What kind of driver are you? I’m sorry. A car was coming my way, I tried to dodge it but hit you! I have two passengers, one is having trouble breathing, if we don’t make it to Lhasa within two hours, her life will be in danger! Look. I’m terribly sorry. Next time be more careful! You go first. I’m fine. Thank you! Let’s take a look. One, two, three! The axle is broken. It’s still a long way to Lhasa. Also a long way back. Even if we find a repair shop, they may not have the right parts. What now? From Lhasa, it’s about 100 km more to go. We’ll ditch the front and pull the carriage. Can we pull it? Let’s give it a try. The women can kowtow behind us. Yes. Ready? Okay, go. That is the pass of Mila Mountain. Tomorrow we will go through there. After this, we will be close to Lhasa. Yeah! Mom, what are you doing now? Taking a break. You said Lhasa is close after this mountain. I kind of miss home. Me too. I’m fine. I’ll pass it to my sister. I want to talk to Grandma! Talk to Grandma. Yes. What are you doing now? Grandma, what are you doing now? I’m here. Don’t cry. Do you miss me? I miss you so much. Sister, what are you doing? Yes, I miss you. Do you miss me? Where is my brother? Do you guys miss me? I miss you all. Hey, brother, what are you doing? I’m here. I miss you! Do you miss me? Women, help us push the cart! We need help! Okay. I walk up the hill step by step, Snow falls bits by bits onto the ground, The place where snow and I are to meet, Then I think of my mother. I walk up the hill step by step, Snow falls bits by bits onto the ground, The place where snow and I are to meet, Then I think of my mother. I walk up the hill step by step, Snow falls bits by bits onto the ground, We have the same mother, But our fates are different.

Jigme. Ah. Send for the Lama, hurry up. Okay. My mother died in her thirties. To raise us three kids, Uncle never got married. Uncle loved doing invocation. He has never fought with anyone in the village. I took him to Lhasa, and then to Kang Rinpoche, to repay his kindness. To die at the foot of Holy Mount Kang Rinpoche, is his karmic reward. I think he is blessed. Passing away here shows his karmic link to the holy mountain. Let’s go. Yeah. Let’s do the invocation. English Translation: Alvin Wang, Julia Xu, Cong Lulu
