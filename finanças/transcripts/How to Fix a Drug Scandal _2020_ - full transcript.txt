These are the criminal files. This is a vault, where we keep any contraband drugs. For instance, this is, 68 grams of cocaine, seized in a, um... an arrest 14 years ago. Thousand grams... of heroin. And we have a control number that the, um, State Police and the analysts use, and it goes into a clear plastic bag and it's heat-sealed. This is, 2,360 bags of heroin. Close to a kilo of cocaine. It was analyzed by Sonja Farak. This is assigned by Sonja Farak. Cocaine, analyzed by Miss Farak. Here's another one, Miss Farak. All these are from 2004 to 2012 when, Sonja Farak was an analyst here. A Hampshire County chemist accused of tampering with drug evidence pleaded not guilty at her arraignment today. Thirty-five-year-old Sonja Farak was arrested on two counts of evidence tampering and two counts of drug possession. If you post the bail, you're released on a series of conditions. You report to probation once a week. You'll be tested for being drug-free. After posting bail, they said that I could drive around to the side door to pick her up. And, you know, a couple of officers brought her out to the car, and the reporters that were around... Sonja, can you say anything to your co-workers? Are you embarrassed at all? I mean, they were completely blocking everything. And I just told them. I said, "Get out of my way or you're gettin' hit." And that's when we realized it was gonna be a little bit more involved. It just... It just wasn't something we were ready for, I guess. When I was in law school, it was the only thing I knew I did not wanna do, was do criminal defense. - Really? - Yeah. - What happened? - I think what I realized is that... the search for the truth that happens in criminal cases on the prosecution side is a search for a truth for a very narrow period of time, and that they want to know what happened in the exact moment that a crime was committed, and they really don't care at all about what happened to defendants up to that moment that, caused them to be in that position where they made those choices. And I realized that the work of a criminal defense attorney often is about the ways in which systems fail people and create environments where these, choices end up happening. So, I think because that's a truth that is unpopular and people don't like to hear about it, I was just drawn to it as a way to, um... you know, do something that I thought was worthwhile. How's your dad doing? - Good. - He still working at Squire's? - Yep. - Yep. Tell him Luke Ryan said hi, all right? No! I've known Luke for years, and I knew him to be a fighter. So good! - My God! - Aaaah! We won! And Luke and I felt the same way. We both believed that Sonja Farak must have been tampering with drugs for years. I think it was our common sense that told us that. Because, usually, you don't just start with an addiction when you're 30-some odd years old. And Luke, he had the same goals that I did. That is, you know, it's our burden to prove something here, and we've got to do it. We're trying to prove that these defendants' drug convictions should be thrown out. Rafael... I think he started using drugs when he was 14. He was young. I hid it from my kids because I didn't want them to... to see that he had that problem. I wanted them to see, like, the superhero dad. Um... And they didn't learn about it till he was in jail. And he called me from jail and he said, you know, Sonja Farak did his evidence. Then he said, "Call my lawyer. Call Luke Ryan." If the government wants to convict a defendant, then the government and all of its actors have to be above reproach. They have to exemplify the law-abiding behavior they demand from all of us and they've gotta prove it. They have to prove every element of every offense that they charge for which they want to find somebody criminally responsible. You know, if you think about what's going on in the big picture with drug cases, you have people whose liberty is being taken from them and they're in court and the process can't go forward until somebody at the lab says, "Yep. That's heroin," or "Yeah. That's cocaine," or "Yeah. That's marijuana." So, Sonja Farak was the chemist in Rafael Rodriguez's case back in 2010. And after Farak's arrest, I filed a motion for a new trial. And Rafael got a stay of his sentence. So he got released on bail only while the case against Farak was pending. - What time did you get in? - 6:30-ish. Okay, and what was your purpose of being there that early? The investigation kind of shed a light on a systemic problem at the Amherst lab. The chemists perpetually had a backlog and were perpetually fighting to... to keep up. Springfield is another of these former industrial towns that has pretty significant poverty and a population susceptible to drugs like heroin, crack cocaine and methamphetamine. And so, Springfield functions as a kind of Western Massachusetts capital of illegal distribution. The journey of a bag of heroin would begin at its point of harvest, the poppy fields of Afghanistan. It gets manufactured locally, transported to our borders, smuggled in, and ends up at a distribution center, someplace like New York City. When it arrives there, it will receive a distinctive brand name, so you know you've got "Sunshine" heroin. From there, it will make its way up Route 95, then end up on Route 91 through Hartford and often to a place like Springfield. When it ends up there, it's usually gonna be given to local dealers. Local dealers will then sell it, either to smaller dealers or to users. And then, if that person is busted, that bag will end up in a cruiser with the police. It goes to the station... At the police station, it's typically taken to a kind of evidence control locker. We don't know at that point whether it's drugs or not. And it ends up in a lab. In the lab, it's supposed to be kept under lock and key. Some chemist is assigned to it. It's supposed to be taken out. It's supposed to be tested. All this is supposed to be very well controlled and documented, um... And then at that point, once there's a result, um, a certification is produced. A document is produced saying, "This substance which was taken out of that guy's pocket on that street corner in Springfield is heroin." Or "It's cocaine." And the chemists, they're under enormous pressure to churn out these certificates, and the prosecutors are calling them up saying, "Hey, we've got this case. I'm getting hell from the judge. The defense attorney's in court, jumpin' up and down. He wants his bail lowered. When am I gonna get a drug cert for this case?" And so that's the kind of pressure that the analysts are under, and it becomes a factory-type mentality. And nobody, I think, really wanted to... to take and professionalize the drug testing. They were really content to see how cheaply it could be done and how many samples they could churn out. There's no cameras in the lab, and there was no even routine weekly inventory of the drugs. So whoever wants to help themselves can open the drug fridge and get high. And that was Sonja in early 2005. She is getting high with liquid methamphetamine several times a day. So, this bottle of liquid meth was big enough and bountiful enough to get her through 2009. And then in 2009, her boss, Jim Hanchett, does a perfunctory audit. the first that anybody's done at Amherst in many years. And he announces that he's going to be doing a roundup of all the standards in the lab, and Sonja begins to panic, um... not just at being discovered, but being arrested and going to prison. I knew that the level had gone down dramatically because of what I had taken, and so in my haste, I added some water to it. Well, oil and water don't mix very well, so it separated. So Hanchett opens the fridge. He finds this bottle. Due to the age of the sample, he assumed that it was just breaking down and so he got rid of it. Sonja was someone who desperately needed something more than what her life presented. She was an anonymous person doing this anonymous function in an industry that no one cares about. I started looking around at the different standards, hoping that there might be something that I could take to help me. And getting high had become the way to reward herself. I found that we had a big jar of amphetamine. And the amphetamine made me feel better, and had the desired effects. I don't think Sonja was a bad chemist. You know, I think that a lot of her actions were questionable, but she seemed to show up every day and do her job and do her job well. I am not an expert on addiction, but I don't think that being on drugs makes you stupid automatically. Particularly stimulants, you know, amphetamines and the like, which are really somewhat performance-enhancing. I... I'm not condoning a drug chemist being on drugs while they do their casework, but I don't think it necessarily implies that she was incapable. I mean, she's not Annie Dookhan. She's not falsifying data. In Massachusetts, there were two main drug labs that were run by the State. One out in Western Massachusetts, and the other lab in Boston. And they geographically handle tens of thousands of cases, west and east. So the Hinton drug lab handled thousands of cases a year. And Annie Dookhan was the key person in one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in the history of Massachusetts. But she was not a famous person, and she's not somebody who strove to be publicly known, but she was a first-generation American and, I mean, like many children of immigrants, they feel that they've got to try harder to get ahead. And so she was very much a... a striver. In high school, at Boston Latin Academy, she was hardworking, she was athletic, she was a track star, and she was, you know, a solid citizen. And by all accounts, she was a model employee inside of the Hinton drug lab in Boston. At a place that few people had given any thought to prior to this enormous scandal. The Hinton lab, it's big. It's giant. It's got, like, 17 different sub-labs within it, doing everything from testing HIV to testing drug samples. They're processing thousands of cases for police departments around the state. It's one of the biggest labs, in... in Massachusetts that tests drug samples. And Annie Dookhan is the superwoman of the Hinton lab. She does more cases than anybody. She's operating at an incredible rate, just churning through samples. So, if the Hinton lab wanted to point to one of its star employees, it was Annie Dookhan. She sets herself apart by virtue of her extremely high level of output. Annie was showing up at break of dawn... and was the last one to turn out the lights every night at work. And she was quite popular with the managers because she was very productive and they felt like they were badly overworked because the War on Drugs had become so large. And she moved things through the system really, really quickly. So she was a prized employee, and she was sometimes envied by the other drug chemists because she did such a huge volume of work. So the first time I heard about Annie Dookhan was in 2012. One of the evidence techs discovered a discrepancy. They were concerned about the volume of cases Annie was producing. Probably four times the average chemist. They couldn't understand how she could possibly do that. But her supervisor explained to us that there was no longer an issue. It was something that they took care of internally. But they didn't speak to any of the chemists. They really didn't do any kind of investigation as to why her cases are so high. If I was running a crime lab and I had someone that was doing work four times more than someone else, I'd bring her in and say, "Show me how you do this, 'cause I wanna teach everybody else." And we found out that the chemists had been complaining about Dookhan for years, saying that she wasn't balancing her scales, she wasn't performing her quality checks. So the supervisors were told "Something's wrong here," and they failed to act. So I asked for an investigation. We needed to find out what had happened. We had spoken to several of the chemists, but we needed to hear from Dookhan. Some officers met with her at her house. She agreed to speak to them. They asked her about the complaints, and they asked how could she do so many cases. I think Annie liked to feel like the go-to person. You know, the DAs would call her directly. She got things done. So, everybody assumed that she was doing the right thing. But she broke down and cried and confessed to everything that she had done. So, the detective called me, after he spoke to Annie, and I knew that, we were gonna have to shut that lab down. Stay with us. Coming up, the Massachusetts State Police are now detailing the possible extent of damage at a now-closed state crime lab. I'm Deborah Becker. I am a reporter for WBUR public radio station in Boston. ...this is Radio Boston... I covered the Annie Dookhan story and the Sonja Farak story... pretty aggressively. I remember when the story first broke, they said a chemist at the lab had mishandled some drug evidence, and they were closing the lab. And so as we're gathering all of this information, the picture of Annie Dookhan that emerged was a very hardworking, ambitious young woman who wanted to succeed in chemistry. And she thought that she would do so by working for the state in this lab. She was diligent and incredibly hardworking. She was also, almost from the beginning of her tenure at the Hinton crime lab, doing something called dry-labbing. Dry-labbing, where she didn't test at all. She would look at something and say that it was the drug, heroin, cocaine, whatever. But she didn't really test it. So what Annie Dookhan was doing was gathering, say, 13, 15 cases that all looked to be the same type of evidence. So, maybe they all looked to be cocaine. She's taking these cases out for analysis all at one time, and maybe only one of them is actually going through the testing process and then she's just applying those results to the other untested cases. It saves a lot of time. You can do a lot more volume that way. But sugar can look a lot like cocaine and... and there's a reason that you do the tests. So, after her arrest, we get this data and it showed us classifications going on that, weren't completely accurate. For example, he finds that Annie Dookhan certifies a substance as being an illegal substance when that substance was, in fact, sodium chloride. Table salt. She was faking. She was cheating, and doing no actual chemical testing of the substance. Um, not putting it under a microscope, not putting it through a spectrometer. She was simply signing off and getting these cases out the door. So, we start thinking, was she part of a bigger problem? Was it a lab problem? Was it a prosecutorial problem? I mean, nobody knew at that point. The story really came out piecemeal. First it was "This lab is closing." Then it was "This chemist is a problem." And then we realized she had been there nine years, and it got bigger and bigger. A major breach could have jeopardized thousands of drug cases, all allegedly because of this chemist, Annie Dookhan. Annie Dookhan has been coming and going all morning from her home. Her family made it very clear they're not happy with the media attention. They put up a "No Trespassing" sign. But if the allegations against her prove true, she'll have a lot more to worry about than TV cameras. Do you have anything to say at all about the allegations? - No. - Can you tell us what happened? There's simply no good answer. The fact is the chemist violated the public trust. More personnel fallout at the drug lab... The head of the Department of Public Health resigned. Then she's arrested. - Talk to us. - Get off the property. Why did she do it? - Leave. - Why did she do it? - How are you doing? - What did she say? How are you doing? Good afternoon. Today's arrest is one step further towards making sure that there is accountability for this corruption of the system. So, the Attorney General speaks about the arrest of Annie Dookhan... And as this investigation is ongoing... ...and says that she really compromised the integrity of the entire criminal justice system. Miss Dookhan, is there anything you want to say? That Annie Dookhan was this rogue actor who wanted to test as many samples as possible. This is a terrible black mark for people that are in the criminal justice system. No one wants anyone to be in jail... because of something that went wrong in a testing procedure. There were a lot of defendants who were very concerned about this. First and foremost, people who were incarcerated for drug tests that had been handled by Annie Dookhan. My perception was anything that she touched should be tossed out. State police have now notified district attorneys and defense lawyers that the chemist was involved in testing thousands... I was a prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney. I started off in the District Court level and then I moved to the Superior Court level, prosecuting, felonies. I got promoted into the drug unit. At first, it was very stressful. You handle probably 40, 50 cases a day, and all these cases were submitted for lab analysis in one lab at the time. Thousands of cases, all going back to the Hinton drug lab. But I was a big government believer. I felt like I was wearing the white hat. And there was a letter that was sent to the DA, and that letter was immediately forwarded to us. And it said there were issues in the drug lab and that Annie Dookhan had participated in misconduct in the lab in testing issues. And one of them was a case that I handled. So, the first thing that I did was call the defense attorney that we handled the case together. And I said, "We have to go back into court." Ethically and constitutionally at this point, we feel that it is in the best interests of justice, that this defendant be released, until... "We have to make sure that this is corrected." Motion to vacate the guilty plea has been allowed. The Superior Court judge vacated a guilty plea of alleged drug dealer David Danielli, all because the evidence in the case was handled by rogue chemist Annie Dookhan. Everyone who's been convicted of a crime related to drugs in Suffolk and Norfolk counties in the last five to six years is possibly the victim of a very substantial miscarriage of justice. Formerly convicted drug dealer David Danielli rushes off to a waiting car moments after he's set free. Family members say it's only fair. Well, if the Constitution isn't upheld for one of us, the Constitution is not upheld for anybody. Well, we know at this point that the letters that were initially sent... And it really shook the foundation of what I believed to be true in the system. It gave me a heightened sense of worry because what she had done affected so many people. When did you first hear the name Annie Dookhan? Where were you? More likely than not, I don't have a specific memory, but more likely than not, I was in my office and I received a phone call from the Massachusetts State Police. I was the Suffolk County District Attorney, which is the city of Boston, primarily, and three small cities north of Boston. It's the most densely-populated county, in our state. When we initially got word of the breach, it had serious implications for our past work. There was a real question as to whether or not these convictions had integrity. And if they did not, then we were gonna either have to re-litigate them or dismiss them. So, we first cross-checked everybody who was actually in custody. They were either serving a prison sentence, a house of corrections sentence, or awaiting trial based on her work. And we looked to get those individuals before the court and got them out of custody. The latest in the Massachusetts drug lab scandal. More cases are headed to court tomorrow. That's right. Prisoners are asking to be released from jail. The idea of a crime wave is a scary thing, and that you're doing it by opening the prison doors and turning out hardened criminals. The reality of what really did happen wasn't quite like that. The vast majority of the people who were convicted with Annie Dookhan evidence were people that were, shall we say, familiar to the justice system. They were either habitual drug users or drug distributors of one kind or another. And so, a lot of them when they got back out, they may have gone back to drugs, but they didn't turn to violence. So it became this just incredibly large case with thousands of, convictions and guilty verdicts being questioned because of what Annie did. The state called her a rogue chemist. Many people thought that it was, sort of, her problem more than anything else. But, there were clearly other problems going on here in the criminal justice system. Early on in the reporting process, my colleague Andrea obtained all of the email correspondence from Annie to others and back to her. And when we started to read through what she was saying to people and how she conducted herself, we realized it was a much bigger story than just one person's incompetence or one person's bad behavior. The emails told us that Annie did not view herself as a neutral party. She viewed herself as part of the law enforcement team. She identified with the prosecutors. She identified with the police. She didn't see herself as a neutral arbiter of the evidence. In fact, when she was contacted by defense attorneys representing the accused, she would always check with the prosecutors or the police as to how she should converse with them. The email exchanges between Annie Dookhan and the ADAs about cases and about defendants certainly puts the lie to the argument that people who work in drug labs, they're not... they're not soldiers in the drug war, they're just scientists. But that's not the impression you get from Annie Dookhan's emails. I think she saw herself as very much on the team and very much supporting the prosecution that was going on in court. We cannot get away from the fact that the product of the crime lab is a report and testimony, and that product is being used by the prosecution. No prosecutor should be seeking me out to specifically work on a case. No prosecutor should be feeding me information about a defendant, explaining to me why it's so important they get the result that they're seeking. I know what result the prosecutor wants. They need a controlled substance, and if I don't deliver a controlled substance, I'm not useful to them. That's understood. As time went on, we got a pretty complete picture of what was really happening. And we began to see in the emails that there was something sicker and darker going on there, and that would include embellishing her professional achievements. She claimed to be going to Harvard night school and getting an advanced degree, and she repeated it so often that the people in the lab believed it and had a celebration congratulating her on her advanced degree... when there was no advanced degree. She wasn't doing anything of the kind. So, she was willing to lie if she could get away with it and have people think more of her. That seemed to be what she fed on, was getting approval from other people. And we certainly saw that she was close with one particular prosecutor. I was getting phone calls from defense attorneys, indicating that, um, reporters were sneaking around the courthouses and asking about, "Hey, did you hear about George and Annie?" Questions started being asked, intimating that I had an affair with her. And I was like, "Where the fuck is this thing going?" "Hi, Annie, surprise, another case in Federal Court. There are four more with your name for January and February. We've all decided that you need a boyfriend. You work too hard. What! It's been three months since the divorce. I called Julie and Betsy to find out your schedule for next week and we had a long conversation. As for your schedule, they laughed." And it's from a person named Susanne Sullivan, and it's addressed to Annie Khan. That's Annie Dookhan's maiden name. So, this is a forgery. This is an email that Annie Dookhan created herself to give the impression of two things. One, that she was divorced, right? "Three months since the divorce." And two, that she's highly desirable and her co-workers think that she needs a boyfriend. So she makes this fraudulent document from a person named Susanne Sullivan, who's an attorney. But the name is misspelled. S-U-S-A-N-N-E should be S-U-Z-A-N-N-E. And forwards it to George Papachristos, the object of her affection, so that he'll see, one, that she's divorced, and two, that her friends all think she's wildly desirable and should have a boyfriend. But it's all fabricated, just like her Harvard degree was fabricated, just like a lot of other things in her life were just fantasy and not real. And then she's, like, so wonderfully sincere, she writes back to Sue. I was hoping that people would see that email and see that... she was... that... that she had an issue. That's where I was hoping the story would have gone because, "Hey, guys, we're dealing with somebody that is writing fake emails, right? Why are we talking about me?" So, Annie forwarded this email saying that she was divorced when she's not. But she's writing to him in this sort of flirtatious way where she's admitting to him that she's unhappy in her marriage and she's telling him personal things about herself and encouraging him to be very personal back to her. It's just very clear that she's trying to draw closer to this guy. But it's an inappropriate relationship, because she's not supposed to be conversing socially with prosecutors at all. What role does a chemist play in a prosecutor's day-to-day work? Well, normally very minimal. I didn't work directly with the lab. The cases were assigned randomly through the office. We didn't know who the chemists were. And most of the cases plead out, so 80% of the time, you normally don't have any contact with the chemists, as a prosecutor. I would say we were friendly. I mean, friendly through email. I mean, I met... I met this woman once, under... under, you know, circumstances that were monitored. But then our emails circulated and they landed in the news. It was kind of insane to me. And the problem with those emails was that they were put in the news after it was discovered what Miss Dookhan was doing. So, without further explanation, it seemed that I had knowledge of what she was up to in that lab. Is there any more to this relationship than just email exchanges between prosecutor and the chemist at the heart of all of this? Being in the news and being talked about like that... He work from... And my family was in the news. ...eight o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock at night, even on the weekends. I just didn't know what to do. I had lost my sense of reality. Everything that I'd come to know as real and what I held... I was... I realized that it was gonna be way more than I could handle. I put in my resignation. Being a prosecutor, that was my dream job. I really loved it. I really enjoyed it. That was the life I wanted. But I couldn't imagine going back to it. I never anticipated becoming a defense attorney, but that's who I am. So now it's a totally different experience, and coming into a courtroom, defending somebody, is one of the most powerless experiences that you can feel. You walk into a courtroom, you're not the prosecutor anymore. You are coming in and you're taking on the accusation yourself. And it's a totally, totally... humbling experience. So, Sonja Farak had been arrested in January, and now we're in March, and so I thought, "We're just gonna go through and have a similar process to what took place in the Boston area with the Dookhan litigation and the discovery." And I assumed that the AG's office is gonna throw the book at Farak, they're gonna investigate the piss out of this lab, and they're gonna want to find everything wrong that Sonja Farak did and gonna want to hold her totally accountable. The Attorney General was tasked with figuring out what Farak had done and which cases might be affected. So, Luke and I, we felt that any conviction where she produced evidence that led to that conviction should be thrown out. So, I was expecting the AG's office to go charging away at Sonja Farak and that would help our clients, because defendants have an absolute right to get access to any potentially exculpatory evidence. There's a constitutional rule that as a criminal defendant, you're entitled to have the government share with you all exculpatory evidence. Exculpatory evidence could be forensic evidence. A third party's fingerprint at a crime scene is exculpatory if their theory is that the only person who could have left the fingerprint is the defendant. Evidence that suggests the person, is guilty of the crime but they were, you know, heavily intoxicated, then that's exculpatory. That was later expanded to include all evidence that would tend to show a jury shouldn't really believe a police officer, shouldn't believe the cooperator, shouldn't believe a prosecution witness. So, it creates a very broad set of rights as a defendant to basically be told if the government knows things that tend to undermine its own prosecution. Prosecutors have this very strange conundrum, because they're the parties who get the evidence first from the cops. Cops are charged with arresting and then investigating crime, and the person they send that evidence to is the prosecutor's office. So, the prosecutor always gets the evidence first and then decides how much to share with the other side. You're essentially asking, in an incredibly intense adversarial system, one side share with the other guy the stuff that may hurt your case and may help him to win. So, I mean, even the best of people, even the best intentions can easily go wrong in a situation like that. Do you think it's difficult for people to self-police and hand over material that may hurt their own cases? No, that's the oath that you take as a prosecutor. I mean, that's part of your job. Somebody's got to be the gatekeeper. I can only speak for my jurisdiction. I mean, our prosecutors, they... they know, just give everything over. I mean, unless it's a very special exception and then you litigate it with the judge whether it should be turned over. I think the most important thing for prosecutors, and I tell it to the new ones, is "Just remember, you have a lot of power, so make sure that justice is done and that the truth is discovered." One of the weird things about the case that unfolded here was the two different entities that were prosecuting. The Attorney General's Office was prosecuting Sonja Farak, but the Hampden County District Attorney's Office was prosecuting our clients. And so that meant anything in the Farak prosecution that suggested Sonja Farak broke the law would be exculpatory evidence in our cases. So, if it was bad for Farak, it was good for us. And I was hoping that we were going to get stuff out of the Farak prosecution that we could turn around and say, "Samples have been compromised. Our clients' rights have been violated. Criminal charges against them should be dismissed." So, August 2013, I get an email saying, "Here's all of the evidence provided by the Attorney General's Office." The email said, "Here's all of our evidence in the Farak investigation. Here's everything that we have." And they sent this document dump. There's thousands of pages. The first 2,500 were... like, manuals for the microscope at the lab, operating instructions for the spectrometer. But the other things that I was really expecting and wanting to see um... were... were hinted at, but were not disclosed. So, we did get photographs that were taken of her car. The car was just a complete mess. The trunk had so many things in it, so many pieces of garbage. Um, so many different papers that the State Police spent hours just taking papers out of the back of her car and trying to put them in some sort of box. Then we get a three-page police report that itemized things that were taken from Sonja Farak's car when they executed the search warrant the day after her arrest. And so when they went to classify, "Well, what was found in Sonja Farak's trunk?" they put, quote, "assorted lab paperwork." There are these repeated references to "assorted lab paperwork" that were found. But that's all they told us is, you know, "Exhibit number X, assorted lab paperwork." And so we had to guess what that meant. And the State Police had delivered to the Attorney General's Office three cartons of what they call "assorted lab paperwork." It... it just made it very, very clear to me that I wanted to see this "assorted lab paperwork." So, in the Attorney General's Office, there are 11 different departments, and one of those departments deals only with appeals and subpoena motions. Um, and the Attorney General's Office assigned this young, um, very inexperienced Assistant Attorney General, Kris Foster. As I understood it, she was a pretty green prosecutor. She really, didn't have much experience. And, you know, I just expected, the A-team. But it was the B-team? I'd say the C-team. I write to Kris Foster, who I learn has been designated the point person for the Attorney General's Office. And I send her an email that said, "Hey, Kris, I'm gonna need to see all this evidence that was seized and hasn't been disclosed. So, can you help me figure out a time and a place to go and... and view the evidence?" Luke asked me to email Kris Foster and to say, "Look, you know, we'd like to come and look at the evidence. And she wrote back, a couple of days later and said that because this was an ongoing prosecution of Sonja Farak, that they would not permit me to look at any of the evidence. I think the email was something like, "I've spoken to my superiors and you're not going to be allowed to look at the evidence." And so the answer was a hard no. Luke Ryan and several of his colleagues, they begin to file motions demanding to see the contents of these three cartons. I filed a motion to inspect the evidence. What happens? They hand over all the evidence, right? They did not hand over all the evidence. Kris Foster sent me the motion to quash your subpoena. "We don't wanna give you anything." I've been covering courts for almost 15 years now, and it's actually been my favorite beat of all the many beats I've covered. I like it because I like to see how "justice" in its amorphous, um, concept plays out. And this is where the story of Sonja Farak played out. The small pieces of the larger picture all happened in this courthouse. So, by late summer of 2013, there are 15 or 16 defendants who have filed motions in Western Massachusetts. And the state court system assigns a magistrate named C. Jeffrey Kinder to oversee this universe of cases. Basically, Judge Kinder's task was to decide when Sonja Farak started mishandling evidence. And he was known as a very straightforward judge, um... Didn't like a lot of argument from lawyers. So, the main question at the Kinder hearings was to examine the scope and timing of Sonja Farak's misconduct, to find out how long had tampering gone on. How long she might have been using drugs. So, we had to make sure that we had all of the evidence in the case, the exculpatory evidence. Kris Foster was sort of the star of that hearing in that she actually got Judge Kinder to be emotional, and, um, that's really rare. So, she just didn't want to answer his questions and he really wasn't used to that. Judge Kinder asked her, "Tell me, in, you know, general terms, what you haven't disclosed." She tells the judge that she can't really say because she hasn't looked at the file. And she said, "Judge, this is just irrelevant evidence. There's no smoking gun. Like, Attorney Ryan is on a fishing expedition." And Kinder explodes at her and says, "What do you mean, there's nothing relevant here? I'll be the person who decides that. Go back, examine the evidence, and submit it to me." So, Foster goes back with her tail between her legs to the office, tells her superiors, and then what she does is write a letter. She wrote a letter to Judge... "Dear Judge Kinder, After reviewing the files, everything's been turned over." "After carefully reviewing the file, every document in it has already been disclosed. Therefore, there's nothing for me to turn over." And so Judge Kinder denied my motion to inspect. And then Judge Kinder found that tampering had only gone back as far as the summer of 2012. I was surprised. You know, how can you say she's fine before then, she was a great worker, no problem, and then decide she, like, "went bad" at a certain date? Kinder decides that these criminal acts of Farak's only go back to July of 2012. And this meant that anybody who had been convicted by Sonja Farak before July 2012 had absolutely no recourse. The Judge Kinder decision meant that anyone who had the substances in their case tested by Sonja Farak before the summer of 2012 were out of luck. Judge Kinder's decision meant that I'd hit a dead end and I wasn't gonna be able to help my client. I stood up and I said, "You know, the Attorney General's Office has not given us access to evidence. It has attempted to minimize and downplay, Sonja Farak's misconduct. And they've demonstrated a clear conflict of interest. We have been forced throughout this process to accept that a person spent nine and a half years as a chemist, but only in her last six months on the job developed a very serious drug addiction. So this process has been tainted by that." Judge Kinder ordered everyone who had their sentences stayed, people who were out of jail, he ordered them to report to court to go back to state prison. These people had gone back to their families and their friends and their kids and they lived normal lives again. And to tell them that they have to go back in, it was extremely... um... painful and harsh. We'd gotten all these people out and then they all had to go back in. Say what you will about people who commit drug crimes. Say what you will about the War on Drugs. These were good people. They all have good hearts. And when they went back in, that was the hardest thing I've ever had to be a part of in... as an attorney, or maybe in anything. I show up to watch Rafael Rodriguez go back to jail and, um... that was heartbreaking. Um... I mean, for him to have to show up in court and kiss his wife goodbye again... It was just a brutal thing to watch happen. He... I don't know, it's 'cause when they... when he came out on bail, he was with us, and then he had to go back. Remember, he had to go back. And it was hard for just letting him go, it would be like, "Okay... He had to go back." It felt like a punch in the gut. I was free. And one day they say, "Look, there's gonna be a hearing and everybody gotta be there." I feel like I was betrayed. All you gotta do is look at her. Just by the look of her, you can tell that she was into drugs. I think she was having this for a long, long time back. Were there other standards you tried like the amphetamine sample? I mean, at some point during that year, I tried the cocaine standard that was in the lab. I was snorting that. But we didn't have as much of it, and we did go back to use that standard because we got a fair number of cocaine submissions to the lab. So I really wasn't using much of it. Is there any time during this period that you moved beyond the use of standards in the lab? Yes, there... was. I tampered with my first piece of evidence. Every Wednesday, there were these big deliveries from the biggest municipality in Western Massachusetts, Springfield. So Sonja, who was now hunting around for a drug that would maintain her, suddenly realizes there's this 500 gram seizure involving the US Postal Service and pauses over it. I was concerned with the cocaine standard and the volume going down. I had been assigned a sample from the USPS, the postal service. And, in that moment, she reflects that she's about to overstep a very bright line. That was a large amount of cocaine, and after I analyzed it, I did take some off to the side for personal use. Did you testify in that case? Yes, I did. How do you remember that case specifically? I remember due to the quantity of it. I remember actually sitting in the stand and looking at it and knowing that I had analyzed the sample and that I had tampered with it. I remember it.
