You're on your own. You have a mission. - A mission? Like John Glenn? Breezy, what is it? - You need to figure that out for yourself. You left some unfinished homework on earth. The time has come for you to go back and complete it. - We even get treated like this when we're dead? - This is no laughing matter, young lady. If you do not succeed in your mission, you will go straight to your personal hell which is, this. - You mean? - Detention forever. With me. - How do I? (thunder cracking) - Pay attention. (upbeat rock music) - It looks just the same. - And it's huge. - Think of it this way, honey, you'll make lots of new friends. - I feel like hick of the universe. - Oh, Cindy honey, please. - I wish we were back in Wisconsin. - I don't like this any more than you do, believe me. - Why couldn't we wait till the end of my senior year? - Ask the savings and loan, okay?

He supported the colonists in the British Parliament. - [Judith] Oh look at this one, this'll make her happy, don't you think? - Oh, duller than clay. I say let's go for a little pizzazz. What do you say, Cindy? - Dad, in this town you need a car that's sturdy and dependable. - Dogs are dependable. A car should be snazzy. - Grandpa, it doesn't make any difference. There's no place I wanna drive to anyway unless it's back home. I don't mean to make you feel bad, ma, but buying a used car is not gonna change my life. - Dad, what's all this water? - What smells fish. - Looks like the freezer's broken.

Oh, well, it's my first time back see and I don't know the rules yet. - Help! - Nartz. You mean I can't touch people? - Okay. No panic. No panicking. You've been under a lot of pressure. The move was so traumatic and your brain manufactures delusions and you don't have any real friends so your subconscious is-- - Hey, hey, hey. You wanna make friends? Cut the pig latin. Work on your wardrobe. I hate to be rude but you're dressed like a skank. - I'm going crazy. - Look, it's perfectly simple. I'm here on a mission. I have to find out what it is. - Get away from me. - Well, look, get a grip. As soon as I finish my mission, I'm outta here. - I'm outta here now. (car engine revving) (snapping) - Boo! (laughing) Frostbite. I'm Angela. (upbeat music) No wonder you bought my car. These look like toasters. You don't have a clue how to drive this. Slouch a little. - I'm not going to listen to you. You're a figment. - Drop your arm out the window and cock back your head. - Leave me alone. I need counseling. - Hey, sexy. - Uh-huh, so that's your speed. - I don't believe it, he noticed me. - In this car? Of course. We're home? Cool, what's for dinner? - Oh my God. How am I gonna explain you to my mother? - Tell her I come with the car. What's that phrase in the ads? Fully loaded? - You really are dead. - Well duh-hey. What do you want me to do, spin my head around? Oh my God! Judy! - God! I don't believe it! - You got so old! - Look at this! I mean it's blue. - Whoa. What is going on? - And it has that white thing that goes down. I don't get it. My best friend in high school had a car just like this. Oh, you don't think it could be the same one, do you? - You two know each other? - Know who? - Don't you see her? - See who? - (gasps) Freeze my socks, I'm invisible. - No, you're not. - Are you high on something? - I'm, losing my mind. I mean, no, I'm, I'm, I'm fine, I'm... (sighs) Maybe I ate too much sugar. - Well maybe you did. Maybe you ought to take a nap, huh? - Good plan, mom. I'll do that. - Okay. - I don't get it. Judy can't see or hear me. Neither can Pops. Why you? I bet it's 'cause you bought my car. You are really a snore to hang out with. - You don't exist. I'm not talking to you. Cut it out. Go haunt my mother. - I tried. It's kind of one-sided. - (sighs) What do you want from me? What do I have to do to get rid of you? - Help me find out what my mission is. - And then what? - I turn in my homework, kiss limbo goodbye, catch the staircase to heaven and party all night with James Dean. - Of course, silly me. I have totally lost it. - So, who was the boat in the sports car? - [Cindy] Boat? - Dreamboat. Dish. Pie slice. - Mike Derron. - You dig him the most, huh? - It's hopeless, I might as well have a crush on the moon. - Baloney! - Mike's the most popular guy in school. And I'm black death, social suicide, cootie bait. I mean even the nerds won't be seen with me. - Come on! I'm dead and I'm not depressed. Pep up. - You don't know what it's like. - Are you for real? High school's the one thing I do know. Oh my God! Cindy, you're it! You're my mission! - I am? - Of course. That's why you can see me and nobody else can. I'm supposed to help you. - Help me what? - You are gonna be too hip to live. (upbeat music) (relaxing music) - [Cindy] I am not having fun. - Come on, roll up your skirt. You look like a square. - I don't believe this is happening to me. I'm too old to have an imaginary friend. - Unbelievable! - Exactly. - So this is a mall. They better have these in my heaven. The moon on a plate. - I look like I'm dressed for trick or treat. - Well coast a little, singer, you look hip. - I don't fill hip. - Well walk right, here. Walk like you mean it. Think James Dean. Think Catwoman. Come on, loose goose. Dare anybody to think you're uncool. (whistling) What did I tell you? - [Bird] Hey babe. (whistling) - Terrific, a bird thinks I'm cool. - Well it's a start. - So there you are. Come here, Lucille. Be a good girl and say Peter, I love you. - [Bird] I love you. - [Cindy] Angela, something's weird. I mean, I don't get it, the cool kids always hang out here. - Microwave? Lambada? PC? CD, VCR, what language is this? What's Tofutti? - Tofutti, it's frozen soy custard. (gasps) Oh my god it's him. Angela, what do I do? - [Angela] Nothing. - Well, you promised me. - I got his number. You want his attention? Act bored, can't be bothered. Works every time. And don't talk to yourself. Loosen up, you look like a lamppost. Come on. (chiming) Jocks are all alike. - I can't believe it, he looked at me. - Crush on the moon, huh? - Angela, he smiled. - Stick with me kid. This is just the beginning. - Oh Angela! (thunder clapping) - (scoffs) Cakewalk. Some mission, I could have done that in my sleep. So, where's Jimmy taking me dancing? It's party time. - What are you doing? You're meddling. - What? I helped Cindy get hip. She's my mission, right? - Do you really think that we would send you back from the dead to go shopping? Now this is it for you, Angela. You got a second chance, most people don't. Make the most of it. - How? I mean you're supposed to be my guidance counselor. Give me some guidance. - Try this. You have until the day of your death to set things right. - Prom night? - You got it. - No way, that's impossible. - Those are the rules. I didn't make 'em. - Well can't you bend them a little? Give me an extension? - Limbo is a serious business. Accomplish your mission by prom night or you will be staying after, right there, in that chair, perfect posture. And silence! And stop wasting your time with Cindy. Buckle down, stick to your mission. - What mission? (fist bangs) (snapping) (thunder clapping) Come back! (sighs) You can't do this. Oh, great. I'm flunking the afterlife. - No, I understand. Thanks, bye-bye. (doorbell ringing) Dad? Dad. (sighs) (doorbell ringing) (dog barking) Who is it? - Freezer delivery. Where do you want me to put it? - Duke? - Holy cow. If it isn't. - Judith! Judith Boyd. Judy Belsen, Judy Belsen! - Judy Belsen, of course! You look just the same. - Well you're a liar but thanks. - Hey, nobody's called me the Duke since senior year. How's uh, um-- - Val? - Yeah Val. - Lousy. He ditched me a year ago. - You don't say. I just got divorced myself. - Really? Oh gee, I'm sorry. - Hey, after a few, it gets easier. - (laughs) I guess. - So where do you want it? - Oh it's going in the garage. But I'll show you the way through the house, come on. I'm usually dressed by now but um, I've been scouring the want ads all morning. - Fresh start, huh? - You know it. Look at this, again. - Oh I know it all too well. Um, so, can I take you to dinner sometime? - Sometime, sure, sure. Ah, step over the popcorn. Through here. And whatever you do, don't look at my kitchen. It's a mess. (bell ringing) - This is so easy. - Easy for you. - What is with you? - What's with me? We gotta talk. You're not my mission. - I'm not? - No. I blew it and I've only got until prom night-- - Angela? - What? - It's been real. - Where are you going? - We all have our problems. My life is no picnic. Your death is no day at the beach, fine. I'm going back to my normal teenage angst and I really don't need it haunted, thank you very much. - You can't do this to me, you're the only one I can talk to. - Great, I've got a schizo spook on my hands. My next class is flunked. - This week's quiz gives us three brand new pillars of ignorance. The Cold War was not in Alaska. The Cuban Revolution was not led by Ricky Ricardo. And General Douglas MacArthur did not write MacArthur Park, people! Scores here, F, D. - What a dipcoat. - Ah, mm, A minus. It was almost intelligent. D. D minus. F minus. (chiming) Who's that? You? - No, I-- - Oh my god. - Speak up! - I don't believe it, that's him! - Who? - The boy that I left at the prom. - You! - Flunkenstein? (students laughing) - Out of my classroom. - But I-- - Out! You're suspended. - What happened to you? - I wanna talk to your parents. You're gonna be very sorry you messed with me. - Holy toledo. That's it, Cindy listen. - Don't talk to me. How could you do that? He'll flunk me for sure. - Don't you see, that's my mission, my unfinished business. I have to help Wayne. - (scoffs) Help him choke. - No, you don't know him like I do. He must have been so badly hurt. That's all my fault. - Fine, you fix it. Just leave me alone. - But I need you. - Drop dead. - I already am dead! - Get deader, just leave me alone! (car engine rumbling) (dog barking) (sighing) Hi grandpa, hi mom. No reason, I just thought I'd take a long lunch. Pfft, no. Um, I had a headache, no. (air whooshing) - I got it. - Oh God, Angela. - Wait till you hear this, it's perfect. Look, Wayne's heart was broken. I'm sure I was sent here to fix it. But he can't see me or hear me. I can't even touch him. - So? - So, that's what I need you for. - Yeah, like I'm really gonna touch Flunkenstein for you. - Look, how about a deal? I'll do anything. You wanna be cool? You'll be glacial. You want friends? You want Mike Derron to take you to the prom? I can tell you when he's alone. Listen in on his secrets. I'll know this guy better than he does. What do you say? - So how are we supposed to help Flunkenstein? - Wayne. Fix him up with your mother. - No way! - [Angela] Cindy. - No! N-O, not a chance. - Look, do you want Mike or not? - Flunkenstein's a creep. I wouldn't do that to my mom. - Wayne is not what you think. I promise. He used to be so sweet and gentle. I know that's still in him, I know it. We got a deal? - Deal. - All right. Next stop, James Dean. (sighs) (sultry saxophone music) Hello Wayne. Look at you. Wayne, I know you're hurt but you gotta move on, I mean all these years, I can't stand it. Look, I know you can't hear me. But please Wayne, get over it! It isn't too late, you're alive! You've still got your music. There is hope. Have I got a girl for you. - Mr. Stein? Mr. Stein, I'm Cindy's mother. - Well, we have a great deal to discuss. - Wayne? Wayne Stein, it is you! I wondered when I heard the name. Judy Belsen. We went to high school together here! - Oh. - Oh? Very eloquent Wayne. - You know, I don't think we've seen each other since, oh, our senior year. - Yes, well. We're not here to reminisce. I'm afraid your daughter's been totally disruptive. She's a troublemaker. - Don't be such a pill! - I will admit she's having some problems adjusting. You see her old high school only had 200 students and she left midyear. - I can't help that, Mrs. Boyd. - Judith, please. You'd think after 20 odd years, we could use each other's first names. - I'm only interested in Cindy's performance. We had this incident. I had to discipline her. - Very convincing tough act Wayne, but I see right through it. You need some help? (chiming) - Why don't I help you with those? - Bingo, now smell the perfume. Stars fall from the ceiling. - I don't need assistance. - Cut the crap, Wayne. (chiming) - Is that your idea of humor? - I didn't do that. - Oh please. - I didn't, I didn't do that. - Don't insult my intelligence. Now I might have been someone to push around when I was a student here, but I'm a teacher now. If your daughter expects to pass history, that will be respected. Good day, Mrs. Boyd. - Nice seeing you again too. - Oh man. This is gonna be rough. (sultry saxophone music) (crickets chirping) - [Judy] Cindy, honey? - Hi mom, did you talk to-- - Yes I did. And he's gunning to flunk you so you better get to work. - But mom! - No buts about it. You get yourself a tutor. - Great. - We gotta do something about this. - You know, I went to high school with that little geek. He was nothing then. He played bassoon in the Gilbert and Sullivan Club. - He plays the, of course. - Hey what are you doing? No don't! - (screaming) No water, no water! Dad, fire! Oh my god, dad, fire! Oh my God. - No problem. (screaming) (fire extinguisher whooshes) I got it all under control. (fire extinguisher whooshing) - So much for my chicken Morango. - Oh no. - Oh daddy, please don't-- - Don't pat your back, I know darling. Well, what do you say we all go out for a sensational dinner? - You got it, Pops. - [Grandpa] Look on the bright side. There's plenty of tables. - [Judy] Well I can't imagine why. - A friend recommended it highly. I'm sure she had her reasons. - I did. Get them to give you a table by the band. Wayne'll come out, wail on his sax. You know what music does for romance. They'll be in heaven. I'll be in heaven. - Good evening. - Good evening. - How many? - Dad. - Two. - [Judy] Three. - Four. But who's counting? - Right this way. I'm sorry it took so long. Another girl quit so we're slightly short-staffed. - Short-staffed? - Oh, Judy. - Could I get an application? - This one. - Can we sit at this one? - [Waitress] Sure. - So close, we'll go deaf. - You'll love it. - No problem. The band only plays Fridays and Saturdays. - [Judy] Oh good. - You're kidding. (sighing) Somebody up there hates me. (jazz music) (gentle music) We've gotta find some way to get them together. - I've got to find some way to graduate. See you around. - Count on it. - [Peter] What can I help you with? - History. - Hi. I thought you were a customer. - I am, I guess, I need a history tutor. - Um, I don't know how I could. - Please, I'm flunking. - Okay, it'd have to be nights. I work here all weekend and after school. - [Bird] I love you. (caws) - Um, a friend of mine. Meet Lucille, come here. Isn't she great? She's $400. That's why I'm working so hard. - What else can she say? - Oh, anything. Cindy, say Cindy. - Brrak, Peter. - She needs a tutor. When do you wanna get started on history? - Oh, soon as you can. I'm in trouble. - How about tonight? - Tonight, I really should. You could come over for dinner. Wait, no, our stove is busted. - Hey, I know where we can go. - [Bird] (caws) Hey babe, hey babe.

Well he is. ♪ Earth angel wha ooh ♪ ♪ Please be mine ♪ - Sure you wanna go through with this? Nod once for yes. ♪ I'm just a fool ♪ ♪ A fool in love with you ♪ (chiming) - Oh God! I'm sorry. I'm gonna clean this up, I'll be right back. - Okay, when he comes back, I'll tell him I'm having an MSG headache. - Whatever you say, boss. Oh, frostbite! A drive in to go! - How's my hair look? - Mint. Okay, he's in action adventure. I'll scope it out. Ask for Top Gun. - I hated that movie. - Tonight, it's your favorite. - Excuse me. - Louder. - Do you have Top Gun? - Not that loud. - Aisle two. - Thanks. - Eyes on the shelf, let him notice you first. - Looking for something? - Low energy, not too excited. - Oh, hi. You renting that? - I've already seen it five times. - Me too. - Yes, you're a natural. - What else is there to do in this nowhere burg? - Don't overdo it. - Hey that was cool what you said about Flunkenstein. - He's a dipcone. - Is not. (whooshing) - So, Cindy. What are you doing next Friday? - I don't know. - I do. Going with me to the wrestling match. - Bingo! Now all we gotta do is make sure Judy gets a date too. - Ah, just like old times. Oh, I still remember your first date. - This isn't a date, dad. - Whatever you say. - You have a date, mom? - Just an old friend from high school. - Yes! I knew Wayne would come around. - That's great, mom. - Thanks. - He'll grow on you, you'll see. Ah, let's not and say we did. - What this thing, damn, it's clogged. I don't know what I'm getting so worked up about. You know, this is just an old high school friend. - I'm glad you met someone you like, mom, whoever he is. - Thanks, sweetie. You look so pretty. (car horn honking) There he is. Well, my shoes, my sweater. - Oh Wayne, that is not a good look. (crickets chirping) Hey wait, that's not. It can't be. - Is it Mike? That's Flunk-- - It's Duke! - You know him? - Know him? I used to date him! Oh, he's the reason I'm here. Oh, this is terrible. Something went wrong. We gotta get Judy away from him! Cindy, forget him. Tell your mother not to go through with this. Make something up. - Later. - Now, Cindy, we made a deal. - Look, I have a date, I'm sorry. - Ugh! - Just a little kiss Judy. - Duke, Duke! Duke, Duke. - Come on baby, please. - I'm sorry you forgot your wallet at home. - Aw come on Judy. - But you're not going to find it in my blouse! - I'm sorry, Judy. It's just, it's just been such a long time since I've been with a really great lady. (air whooshing) - Oh Judy, Judy, Judy. You feel so good Judy. - What's going on here? - Duke, please, please. Duke! (Duke moaning) (chiming) - What was that? - Listen, Duke. (Duke moaning) I better be going. - All right, okay, whatever you say, whatever you say. Would you like a little drink first? - No. - Let me play you some tunes. What do you like, let me guess. New age? Jazz? Captain and Tenille? (upbeat music) - You want it, you got it. (chiming) (explosion booms) (Judy screams) Whoa! - It's never done this before. (static buzzing) (mixer whirring) Damn, must be a fuse. Not to worry. I've got an emergency light system. Hi babe, this must be your luck. Judy. - Smooth moves, Duke. (car rumbling) - That was incredible. I've never been to a wrestling match before. - Scarred him, huh? - You were wonderful. - Little pat on the bones. - You were great. - Quite the master faces. - Yeah. - I totally am! - You were cooler than frostbite. - You know you're really good to talk to. You got style. I respect that. (dog barking) - I'm in heaven. - Well I'm not. - Moon on a plate. He took care of me. Everybody looked at me like, like I was somebody. Nobody said baa. Nobody even ignored me. - We had a deal, Cindy. - Okay, okay, I know, I owe you one. How can I help? - Okay. Duke's out of the picture. No thanks to you. I need you to talk up Wayne. - Sure, right, I got it. Flunkenstein's a prince in disguise. - His name is Wayne. And he is. - It's a good disguise. Fine, I believe you. - Mike kissed you goodnight? - Mm-hmm. - Ask you out again? - No. - [Angela] He will. - It's too good to be true. He's out of my league. And way down deep he must know that I'm not really cool. - Baloney. You're in like Flynn. Okay, the deal is, you don't talk to him first. Let him think he's making the moves. It's only two weeks until prom and we've gotta make sure Mike invites you. - One week. - What? - Prom's in one week. What's the matter? - We gotta act fast! (crowd chattering) - Honey, honey, you know what? It ain't the world war, it's just ribs. Look, it's after nine, you're off shift. I'll take this. - Oh, thanks Joyce. - First Saturday? - Yeah, boy this place is a zoo. - Well Saturday's always a zoo. Who gets the rib combos? - Oh, table seven. Thanks, Joyce, thank you. - Welcome. - Forgetting something? - Wayne. - What are you doing here? - Well I'm serving bad food, I'm afraid. Oh you aren't eating here, are you? - No, no, I was just, you know, I have to. (sighing) I work here, weekends. - Small world. - So, let's make it a little smaller. - Well you know, Cindy's become quite a little history buff, yes sir. Got herself a tutor. Can't stop talking about you. - I can imagine. Excuse me. - Nice work, pal. - Thank you very much. - Oh no, you don't wanna leave yet. (coins clinking) - I don't deserve this. - Trust me. (crowd chattering) - Frank, could you cash me out please? (upbeat saxophone music) Wayne? - Halfway to heaven. - What a waste. Thanks, Frank, that's for you. - I can't do this alone. And no way can I do it by prom night. - Nixon, Ford, Carter. Chuck Berry, Lou Reed, Myrna Loy. I'm electing new presidents. Care to pitch in? - I'm sorry. - Wanna tell me about it? Something the matter? - Of course not. - (sighing) Okay. Vice presidents. Agnew, Ford, Nixon, Mondale. (air whooshing) - Mike's at the mall. - [Peter] Bush, Johnson, Humphrey. (friends cheering) - Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke, Duke! - Yeah, yeah, yes! Oh baby! (laughing) (chiming) - Too many stimulants. Speaking of which, where's the party at? - Oh, the big blowout, night before prom. Whole team's invited. - Here's the move, let him make it. - You too of course, since you are my prom date. - Told you so. - So where is it, the party? - Well uh, how about your place? My old man said never again after last year. - What a feeb. - It was only a brush fire. - So what do you say? - I'll ask my mom. - Not good enough. - Sure. (laughing) - How about another potato? Come on! - [Duke] Knock knock. - Dad? - Your line is, who's there? And the answer is, someone who's sorry. - Hello, Duke. - For you. - Oh really, you shouldn't have. - The other night. - Let's just forget about that, okay? - I know I came on way too strong. But the plain fact is, you are a sight for sore eyes. - Duke, I really don't think that-- - We go back, Judy. We've got a history. I've made a lot of wrong moves in my life and I don't want this to be one of them. - Duke. - I need you. I need a together, strong, beautiful lady who'll call me a jerk when I act like a jerk. I know I messed up. But please, let me try again? - Gee, Duke, I don't know what to say. - Just say yes. - Well, all right. Let's try again. - You're a peach, Judy. - [Judy] Oh thank you. - I'll pick you up Friday night, right after work. - Okay, all right. - Nice buds. For me? - For your mother. From Duke. She's going out with him again. - Well you've got to admit, he's showing more interest than Flunken, than Wayne. - Cindy, the prom's almost here. If I don't solve my mission, I'm done for. - Look, Angela, I got my mother at the Flaming Pit. I got her to hear Wayne's music. I even talked the guy up. They don't get along. You know why? Because Flunkenstein's a skank. - Cindy! - Maybe he was the nicest guy in the world in high school. He just isn't that guy anymore. - Ugh, that can't be true. (gentle music) You dope! I led her right into your lap and you dropped her! What are you waiting for? Do you wanna be dead for the rest of your life? I'm the one who got killed. But you didn't die, Wayne. You just gave up. Take that thing out of your mouth! - Damn. - That's right. You can't concentrate, can you. You know why? You're thinking of her. And you should be. I can see what you're feeling. You have that same glow in your eye when you used to look at me. Use it. ♪ And let me love again ♪ - It's time, Wayne. Let go of the past. You've got to be able to hear me. Of course you can. Grab her. And kiss her. And don't be afraid of what anyone thinks. They're not there, Wayne. There's no one on Earth except you and-- - Judith. (students chattering) - Ugh, what a loser. - The slut. - Hi Cindy. We getting together tonight? - I really don't think I need any more tutoring. - You don't wanna cram for finals? - Hey, Cindy's busy. She's got other plans. - Hey fox. - I'll see you, okay? - What time does it start? - What? - The party. - Peter. - The party's just for the team, man. - I mean really, do we crash your parties? - Some people just don't get it. - Come on, Cindy. (bell ringing) - I hope you all flunk. - Frank, two screaming clams. - Hi. - Oh, Joyce. - So what do we got? - We got two customers on table four. They're having drinks, order's in. - Are they having food? - I don't know you'll find out. Good night, Joyce. - Good night. - Oh, I'm so sorry Oh hi, Wayne. - Judith. (chiming) - Oh, oh. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. - I didn't mean to. (chiming) - What, what is it? (sighing) - Now, you dope, now! - I wondered. Could I take you out for a drink after work? - Well thanks Wayne, but I already have a date. (gentle music) - I'm a yoyo.

Can I have a couple of club sodas over here? - You know I think the last time I was stood up, probably in high school. (sighing) - It's terrible waiting for someone. - Yeah, well. At least I have plenty to listen to. Thanks, Frank. You know, you're real good, Wayne. You could have been a professional if you wanted to. - I did want to. - Well what stopped you, Wayne? - Life. - Yep, it'll do that. - Judith. - Yes? - See I have to, um, I'm acting as a prom chaperone tomorrow. (phone ringing) And uh, well see, I was wondering if-- - Judith. - Maybe you could. - Some guy. - Thanks, Frank. Excuse me. Hello? - Judy? Oh you'll never. (chiming) - Wrong, Duke.

(sighing) (gentle music) - Where were we? - Oh. I think I was asking. - I'd love to. (upbeat country music) - Yes! Meanwhile, back at the Flaming Pit. (air whooshing) (chiming) How'd I get here? - You're in trouble. - I'm on the case. Judith and Wayne are about to-- - Cindy. - All right. So I meddled a little. - You meddled a lot. You solved one problem and started another. - For your information, Cindy is having the time of her life with the boy of her dreams as we speak! - You haven't learned anything, have you? - What is this, a quiz? Cindy's got what she wanted. - You led her down the same stupid path that you got stuck on in high school. And look what became of you! - What? You mean Cindy's in danger? - You both are. Take care of it. (thunder clapping) - I'm getting jetlagged. Cindy. Cindy! ♪ Friends and lovebirds ♪ ♪ And long embraces ♪ (chiming) - No worries, I'll fix it. - Come on, I need to talk to you. - Not now. - Right now or else I turn this party into a poltergeist food fight. - What is the matter with you? - You're in danger. - You're gonna wreck everything. - I already did. This is all a mistake. Your clothes, your friends, Mike. Especially Mike. - Are you orbiting? - Oh Cindy, this isn't you. Give up this popularity contest and be yourself. Don't make the same mistake I made. Life is too short. - Is that it? - Yes. - Well forget it. (scoffs) I'm not gonna give this up. I worked hard to be too hip to live. I like it. - Cindy, I'm trying to warn you. - Look, Angela. When I first moved to this school, I was nobody. Everybody laughed at me. Nobody but Peter would even speak to me. I had no friends. - Wrong. You had one friend. Now you have no friends. - Get out of my life. (sighing) (birds chirping) - Morning dad, morning honey. I made breakfast. - I know the place is a wreck. I promise I'll clean up. - Oh honey don't worry about it. We'll have this cleaned up in no time. - Must have been some date. - He never showed up. - But why are we so damn perky? - Oh, no special reason. It's a beautiful morning, the sun is shining, the birdies are singing. (doorbell ringing) I'll get it. - This place is a madhouse. - Don't look at me. - [Judy] Cindy honey, I think it's for you. - What? - [Bird] Cindy, Peter. Cindy, I love you, ooh, ooh. You're a line, ooh. - Oh God. - Thank you, have a nice day. - What's this supposed to mean? You trying to make me feel guilty? - You stole her! What was this, some kind of frat house prank? - What? - Wrestling team treasure hunt? It's no joke? - Peter. - What happened to you, huh? You used to be a nice person. I thought we were friends. - Let me get this straight. You didn't send me the parrot? - This is really not funny. - Who else would have? Angela. - Who's Angela? - She's. Forget it. Cheap trick. Did you really think sending me a parrot would change my mind? - What? That geek sent you something? - Mike, no. Mike, don't! - Who told you to send my girl a present, huh? (punch thuds) - Mike, stop it! (display crashing) - You don't go near her, you don't even think of her, you got that? - Let go of me! (chiming) - Mike, don't! - What did you do? - I didn't! - Drop the bone, babe, you're coming with me. - No I'm not. - Look, if you know what's good for you. - What are you going to do, Mike, punch me out too? - Hey don't give me any lip. - Get away from me. - Meet me at the tux shop in 10 minutes. No, make it five! - Leave us alone. Did he hurt you? - Hell no. I love getting punched out by furious wrestlers. - I never saw him like that. Peter, I feel really bad. - Your five minutes are up. - What? - Mike gave you five minutes. You better show up or he'll, he'll punch your nose. - That's not funny. - I don't think so either. - [Cindy] You know, Mike doesn't own me. - Try telling him that. - Do you think you could ever forgive me? - Probably. (gentle music) - You're really a great guy. - Yeah, for a geek. - No. You're just a great guy. How's your nose? (laughing) - I think it stopped bleeding. - Do you have any plans for tonight? - Not really, why? - I've got this prom gown I won't have much use for. - You're not gonna, you're not gonna go with Mike? - Not on your life. (puppy yipping) Do that again. Not bad for a geek. (rain pattering) - Hey where the hell have you been? - I don't have to tell you. - Now I don't wanna hear it, all right? Are you out of your mind? - [Cindy] I am not going with you, Mike. I don't care what you say. - Well see you're turning down me to go out with that pencil neck. - Stop calling him names. - Look, I'm gonna bust his head! - You already did, Mike. - Look, I bought your corsage! - I'm not going with you. Just get over it. (car horn honking) - No! (tires screeching) (thunder clapping) - Pretty hot driving. - Get out of my car! - I just saved your life! - Out. - Hey, you're in shock. I respect that. - Get out of my car! - It's raining! - Get wet! - All right. Fine! But you better meet me at that prom! Otherwise you're gonna live to regret it! And so is young Flunkenstein. - Boy, were you right about... (dramatic music) Angela? Angela? Angela? (horse braying) (kooky music) (doorbell ringing) - I'll get it, dad, I'll get it. - Nice outfit. - You can save it, Duke. - Can I just tell you how sorry I am? - Pretty sorry, huh? - No Judy, I had to hang up. This little old lady right next to the phone started clutching her arm like she's having a heart attack. But lucky for her, the Duke picked up some CPR over in Nam. So I'm standing there pumping her heart-- - [Wayne] Judith? Hi. - Hi. - That's for you. - Oh, thank you. - Duke? - Wayne Stein?
