- [Voiceover] I was born in 1968, the day before Martin Luther King Junior was assassinated. My mom raised me to believe in freedom, justice, and equality for all. I dreamed of fighting the good fight. But I never dreamed that my first attempt at labor activism would be as a stripper. [seductive music] - When I was 27, I moved to San Francisco to be a writer and stand up comic. So I finally, you know, came out. I was the second to last person to know I was a dyke. Can you guess who the last was? - [Voiceover] Your mother. - My mother. Then finally my mother turned to me and she said, "Julia, can we talk?" "Julia, every Friday night you go "to that lesbian night club. "What is it called? "The Clit Club. "Julia, all of you friends are lesbians. "Julia, do they think you're a lesbian?" [audience laughing] - Doing comedy wasn't paying the bills. I needed a job with flexible hours and good pay. A friend suggested I work at the Lusty Lady, because it had a reputation as the hip, feminist peep show with good working conditions. I was comfortable showing my body, especially since there was no cigar chomping boss. Most of the managers were women. So what's the object of putting on makeup? - [Voiceover] It's like a mask. - [Voiceover] A mask? - [Voiceover] Yeah. Like getting ready for the circus. [laughter] - [Voiceover] You're a big ol' clown. - [Voiceover] It's kind of fun to be a little disguised. - This makeup I've got right here belonged to my mother, in the early 80's and I, when I was 13 just like fell in love with it. I mean what 13 year old girl would not like this like sparkly purple powder. But it's still good, because it's quality shit. - [Voiceover] It's not like she's heterosexual. [laughter] [hip hop music] - [Voiceover] Unlike strip clubs, where dancers have physical contact with customers, we dance in a small mirrored room. The men stand in booths the size of broom closest and watch us through windows at about 15 seconds per quarter. - I never been inside of a peep show. And I remember the first time on stage, I couldn't get over how much it looked like a fish tank. Like I was under water, like the mermaid. And I loved dancing in a little room with other women. It was like a weird pajama party. Um, I liked the music, the lights, and I like the fact that the customers look like little things in boxes, like jack-n-the box. What we all have in common is that, ya know we're all in it for the money. Ya know, I wouldn't be standing, ya know, in heels for a bunch of strangers if I wasn't getting paid. - But I love working at the peep show because I've never worked with so many women with college degrees. [laughter] - Mostly in women's studies and philosophy. It's like the figured out what to do about patriarchy. Take their money. [laughing and cheering] - So what's your name? - Walter. - Walter. How you doin' Walter? - Pretty good, how are you doing? - Pretty good, have you been here before? - A couple times. - [Voiceover] I was working full time in social services, but then on my off day I would strip. So, yeah, social work and sex work. It's kind of odd. I loved it actually. I felt that it was a very strong thing. Use my sexuality, my feminine power, in a way that made me feel good and a way that profited me. That I was finally being paid what I was worth, which I was not in my job before. And the women that I met dancing were some of the strongest women I've met in my whole life. - Sex work is a form of work. The sex industry is an industry that pays many peoples' bills, pays people through school, raises children. It helps people start small businesses. But, at the same time, I view sex work as a sacred act. Even in the most base context, like this pornographic peep show, there's life force in it and it is healthy. And I considered myself to be providing a spiritual service. A sexual spiritual service. [simple guitar music playing] - I was so nai√Øve. I really worried that they wouldn't hire me because I couldn't dance well enough. [laughter] Gee, mom, thanks for the six years of ballet. [laughter] - My mom had taught me that I could be anything. My mom was a nice Jewish girl and her parents expected her to marry a doctor. She rebelled, she became a doctor. I went to medical school too, tucked under my mom's lab coat. She was a divorced mother in the 1970's who told me not to be ashamed of my body. To feel entitled to pleasure. To be independent and strong. In graduate school I wrote a paper analyzing the feminist debates about the sex industry. Even though I argue that sex work should be understood as just that, work. I didn't tell my classmates or my mother about my job in the industry. In San Francisco, I found out that I could make the most money at the strip clubs with stage shows and lap dancing. But the idea of dancing alone on a stage was terrifying. Despite six years of ballet, I can't dance. Unlike strip clubs, at a peep show, I wouldn't be alone on a stage and there are poles I can hang on too. Now that I could do. One day I was late to work by a couple of minutes. The managers told me I wouldn't get my scheduled raise. That's when I started seeing the problems. - You could be working there for two years and be making 20 dollars an hour, top wage. And let's say you forgot to go to a meeting, you would be knocked back down to the starting wage. And when you get to like 18 dollars an hour, you suddenly look different. You were told that you were unattractive, over weight suddenly, cut down on shifts, or written off the schedule all together. So basically everyone operated up under this fear. It's this unspoken thing of what we're trying to get rid of you before you reach top wage. So it saves them money. - [Voiceover] I had never had a job that didn't allow you to call in sick. But here if you couldn't fine someone to replace your shift, you had to work or risk loosing your job. So we came to work sick, coughing and sneezing, in that tiny little incubator of a room. You'd think finding one women out of 70 to take your shift would be a snap, but there was a catch. Your replacement had to have skin and hair as light as yours or lighter. Her breasts had to be as big as yours or bigger. We were all classified by race, hair color, and breast size. - At a certain point at the lusty lady, I started wearing a blonde wig. Which they barely were gonna allow me to do 'cause they had me so pegged as oh dark, dark exotic, dark exotic. Dark and exotic which meant they'd give me very few shifts. [seductive music] - I look absurd in this blonde wig. It doesn't really look right on me. It's just the symbol. And then that's when I started getting shifts. Getting enough shifts. Making enough money in the sex industry. - [Voiceover] The club would only schedule one dancer of color per shift. Thus they had fewer available shifts. And in the higher paid, one on one fantasy talk booth, called Private Pleasures, management wouldn't schedule black dancers at all. - At first I felt it was me. And I started to look at the schedule and I noticed that it was not just me. I noticed that the other three black girls were never in booth. - Manager back then said, um, black dancers were not as marketable as white dancers. Therefore it would not be, it would not be profitable to schedule them here. - Well at the Lusty Lady, we do have an interest in expanding the customers idea of what is sexually attractive. If you looked at the sales and rental charts of videos, you would see that probably all of the top 10, are busty blonde women. Well, there actually are women of color, there are brunettes and red heads, Asian women, and other ethnic women in the world. And um, some people actually find them attractive. And too expand their audience, we, we schedule based on a diversity principle. Where we try to have women of color represented as much as possible throughout the day and throughout the week. - It doesn't matter if a specific race is more or less marketable than another race because, you know, it's illegal. You can't classify workers on the bases of race. - The theater has a no camera policy and that's to protect the privacy of the dancers. It's one of the issues that probably bother support staff the most. Because it's a security issue and we care about the people we work with. And we know that they don't like being photographed against their will. - [Voiceover] Three of the 13 windows facing the stage had one way glass. So the customers could see us but we couldn't see them. Frequently, customers would secretly videotape us. We heard rumors about images of us showing up on the internet and in porno tapes. We complained to management, but they did nothing. - We were not being paid to be filmed. We were just being paid to dance there and you don't know where these images are going to turn up. You're just being taken advantage of on a number of levels. It had to do with our safety. It had to do with ethics. It had to do with our legal rights. This had a lot of people upset. But Star is just somebody whose a real hot head. and she was on stage dancing in front of a one way. - There had been a newer dancer, like dancing for him for quite a while. And she thought he had like a funny toy or watch or something. And she push... She's all, "Star, Star oh come on you have to see this, I've been dancing for him for like 45 minutes or something. He's got some sort of weird toy. It keeps blinking on and off. - I was working with, another support staff member, Elise. We got a camera call. Opened the door, saw that the customer had a video camera. Um, we asked him to step out of the booth and he passed off the camera to his friends and they made a b-line for the door. One of them turned around to throw a punch at me and I ducked. And Elise took the blow in the face. - Manager was downstairs the whole time. And I went down there and was really mad. And they were just like "Star, if you can't live with it, you shouldn't work here." I went crazy. I basically had a big fit. And I was just like "No, that's not the way it works. "I'm working here and I can't live with it." - And then it was almost like a snowball. More and more people feeling that way. - Everyone was just as amazed, like individually amazed, like "Oh you're as angry as I am?" - [Voiceover] Enough was enough, we decided to unionize. Here amid the neon lights, the fake hair, the high heels was the good fight I had dreamed of fighting. [shouting chant] - [Voiceover] The service employees union, S C I U, local 790, agreed to represent us. [shouting chant] - [Voiceover] The owners were shocked. To buy us off, they removed the one way windows and started scheduling black dancers in the Private Pleasures both. We knew we were on to something. - Well in a move sure to send shock waves through the industry, nude dancers, at San Francisco's Lusty Lady Club have voted to unionize. - [Voiceover] Media attention helped keep the heat on management. But I worried that my mother would recognize my voice and find out that I was stripping. I was used to seeing my mother on television. My mother is Doctor Joyce Wallace. - We need safe houses for ex-prostitutes. They get beat up. They get killed. There's nobody who cares for them. There's nobody who loves them. There's nobody who wants them. - [Voiceover] This woman wants them. She is Doctor Joyce Wallace. In her private practice, she's an internist. But she spent the last decade here in New York. Trying to study and help the thousands of prostitutes who live here. She's developed programs that use mobile units. Vans that cruise the city streets looking for prostitutes in need of help. - There's a lady over there. See her. - And I see down here there's a whole box of condoms. So they'll come to the window and you'll just give these out. - Yes. - It says "Kiss of mint." - That's the oral sex. - I see. - [Voiceover] I thought we had won when we voted in the union, but the real battle is at the bargaining table. We had to negotiate for a contract. Management hired Littler Mendelssohn. A renowned anti-union law firm. - [digital voice] Littler Mendelssohn is representation of employers includes advising employers on lawfully maintaining a union-free workplace. - [Voiceover] We represented ourselves at the bargaining table. After all, our union didn't have a peep show specialist. I volunteered to be on the bargaining committee, along with Jane, Tara, Decadence, Naomi, Velvet, and two members of the support staff, Elise and Scott. Often others among the 85 of us workers participated as well. We didn't have a lawyer, but our union provided us with a negotiator, Stephanie Batey. Who had experience fighting anti-union lawyers. - Public pressure and other internal pressure on them to get a contract. This isn't about anything else, but forcing them to negotiate with you, to get a collective bargaining agreement that protects you. - [Voiceover] Stephanie told us that owners don't want a contract at all. And they don't agree to a contract in 70 percent of first time negotiations. But we were optimistic. We wanted sick pay and health insurance. We wanted to stop management from firing us without just cause. We wanted an end to scheduling practices based on race and breast size. Stephanie emphasized that we needed a union security clause, otherwise management could bust the union. We proposed agency shop. Under an agency shop contract, all workers pay union dues and receive union protection. Under an open shop contract, management has more power, because workers don't have to join the union or pay dues. We found it sobering that the only other strip club to unionize before us, had accepted an open shop. The owners hired workers who wouldn't join and they swiftly lost their union. I walked into negotiations expecting to negotiate. But for the first two months we just kept sending proposals back and forth. So at the place I'm working now, we're fighting to unionize and we voted to unionize and we're negotiating with the lawyers. And the lawyers say things like, "Well we want to put the word fun in the preamble. "Your job will be described as a temporary, part time, "fun, employment." And I'm thinking, do they do that to the steel workers? - Alan's exact words were we're not expected to work hard. He said this is a part time temporary job where you don't have to work very hard. - I guess I just asked him if he was trying to piss us off by saying that. I mean, like, why would you say something like that to somebody who's, who's spending up to 12 hours a day at a bargaining table. Ya know, at a job that they didn't care about or they thought they were doing it just for fun. It's insulting. - [Voiceover] It is. - Just making money off my ass. - So this guy, I'm in the little booth, and he says to me, "So what's your job?" I said, "I'm a stripper." He said, "No. "What do you do for money?" I said, "Oh, well, I'm a corporate union busting lawyer. "I just do this for fun." [laughter] - We printed up flyers every day after bargaining. Um, we kept the rest of the workers really informed about what was going on at the bargaining table. And the lawyer took an issue with the language we used to communicate amongst ourselves. - Specifically the word pussy they didn't want us to ever put in writing. We've asked 'em to defend why he thought that the company had the right to put those kind of limits on our free speech. And he said, "Well I don't let my kids talk that way. [laughs] "Why should I let you?" - He talked about how offended he was. "I don't even wanna say that word pussy" and pussy, pussy, pussy he kept saying it over and over again. - He was the one who accused us of sexually harassing ourselves, [laughs] by using the word pussy. [laughs] - It's funny you can show your pussy, but you can't say the word pussy. - [Voiceover] What are you thinking about? - My knee is killing me. - [Voiceover] Well what do you think about when you're on stage? - Mmm, most anything. Um, what I'm going to do that evening, other appointments I have, my body a lot, and a lot of the time I look at the other girls. - The customers come in and they don't shut their door. So all their friends can watch you on the same quarter. And so all the hall is getting a free show. So often, especially on rowdy weekend nights we are finding ourselves to close the door. Please close the door, close the door now. Some guy came into the live show and did not close his door. A dancer told him to close his door and he didn't like this. So he went into the Private Pleasures booth down the hall and pulled out a gun and pointed it at the dancer in that booth. - What happens during violent events, is that we usually call the cops, they arrive, either A, just in time to not get the violent perpetrators or B, several hours later. At which point, the point is moot. - We were all very concerned, we thought, ya know, let's put in bullet proof glass. And management's response was to blame us. You know, if our tone of voice had been different, then we wouldn't have guns pulled on us. - Here's the directive straight from management's mouth. "And remember that yelling at a customer "is not nearly as effective as "coyly coaxing them into good behavior." Being direct with them, they don't like that. They want coy coaxing. The problem with coyly coaxing is is that it just, they think, the customers think you're playing. And they think it's a game and they don't listen to you. You need to like get into your real world voice. There's usually two voices we use at work. They're like two to three octaves above your real voice that you use with the customers. It's about the same kind of voice you use with a toddler. And um, then there's the real world voice when you're getting serious like "Close the door." They want us to go [sweetly] "Can you close the door?" - [Voiceover] A lot of Lusty Lady dancers worked at more than one club. From the world famous Mitchell brothers, O'Farrell Theater to the notorious, low brow Market Street cinema. I wondered why dancers at other clubs in town weren't unionizing too. My friends told me that dancers were organizing. But that in the last 10 years, working conditions had only gotten worse. - I worked in the lap dancing clubs because I made a lot more money there. I made in one night what I'd make in one or two weeks at the Lusty. But you know, we made more money because it was a lot more intense work. - When I first started working out, I thought, oh, okay I'm gonna get paid to dance. And when I walked in I saw lap dancing for the first time. And I was like, what are they doing? Are they having sex in here? I mean these women are like gyrating on the customers. I was just totally overwhelmed by it. - Now the stage show, which use to be the central thing of a strip tease, right now it's just the part of your job you have to do so you can lap dance and make your real money. - When I started stripping, which is seven years ago, we did stage shows. I did very flamboyant ones. I appreciated the teasing aspect of the stripping industry. There weren't girls up in the dressing room talking about "Oh yeah I'm getting this customer off." That was not your goal. - I noticed over time that what we had to do to make our money changed. - [Voiceover] At clubs across the city, dancers were getting paid less and less to do more and more. - The conditions got paid when the Mitchell brothers took the glass out of a peep show room. At the Century, where I was working, they took the windows out of there too. They started to build rooms in the back where we could go alone with customers. - Someone was working at Deja Vu and the manager told her, "Well it's okay "if the customers touch your tits." And she said, "Well, I thought that was illegal." And he said, "No, it's okay." - Suddenly they wanted to charge us a stage fee of five dollars and then within a few months it was ten. - In recent years, club owners nationwide have started imposing stage fees which is essentially charging the dancers to come to work. Five or seven years ago it was like five, 10, 15 dollars. 20 dollars. Now it's upwards at 150 at some places. - You're relying on your tips. You're turning in a percent to management. If you don't meet your quota, you're fired or you're suspended. - I mean it, I saw, this is why I left New Century. Because dancers would cry or they would get fired. They didn't make the quota they would be thinking, "Oh my god, ya know, I can't afford to lose my job. "How am I going to feed my kid?" But yet, so they'd bring in their own money. It really, like, I felt the stress, because you have a four hour shift there. - [Voiceover] You have to pay 250 dollars in a four hour shift? - In a four hour shift. Yes. And of that you get to keep 90 something. - There are women who they have one understanding of what the job is. And now once they're working in the club, finding that their, all this pressure and coercion to do, um, pressuring them into doing illegal things. To make enough money to pay the quota. - On several occasions there was one manager in particular, that would ask me to go out with the owner's friends when they came to town. So, Ya know, definitely trying to pimp me out. It was just this continual behavior that you would definitely question if you were working at Macy's. Finally I was just like that's enough. - [Voiceover] At the Lusty Lady, we are employees. Most strip clubs illegally classify their workers as independent contractors to avoid paying wages, unemployment, and payroll taxes. Also, independent contractors can't unionize. In the early 1990's before we even thought of unionizing, San Francisco strippers formed the Exotic Dancers Alliance and started organizing for basic workers rights. - [Voiceover] Hi, dancer's meeting, please take one. Thanks. We from the Market Streets, I use to work here. - I'm just telling ya don't pass this stuff out to the girls. We're good here. We're not hiding nothing. - [Voiceover] Then why you have to chase us away. - Because you're loitering in front of my building, ya know, it doesn't look good for business. - This is our business, it don't look good. - We're trying to run a clean business here. Don't need her shit and I don't need your shit either. How about we shove it up your ass. - [Voiceover] Dancers at clubs across town began to sue for recognition of their employee status, for restoration of wages, and to stop sexual harassment. - And that process was very interesting. In that we were told by the head of the labor commission that if he were dealing with agricultural or um, factory workers, garment factory workers, then he would be more inclined to use the resources that he had. But he did not choose to waste the tax payers resources on this, quote on quote, class of workers. - [Voiceover] We want prostitutes off our streets. We want prostitutes off our streets. - [Voiceover] I knew that all sex workers are scorned. Even my mother was subject to protests and hate mail just for trying to help street prostitutes. Once she came home to a bomb threat on her door. Because of my mothers work, I had known since I was a teenager about the struggle for prostitutes rights. By activist such as Margo St. James. And Carol Lee, aka, Scarlet Harlot. They paved the way by arguing that sex work isn't shameful. Now they were supporting our organizing efforts. I was thrilled to meet and work with them. They said our union was a win for sex workers everywhere. - [Voiceover] You never call me back. It's your mother. I would like to know what's happening with you. I do care, okay? And I really want to talk to you, because I don't know what's going on and uh, that everything's alright. Okay, it's been a long time and I haven't heard from you. Bye. - [Voiceover] Hi mama. Oh, I'm fine. Um, no, nothing's going on. I'm writing. Okay. Negotiations were crawling. Management was still pushing to have the job formally declared "fun." We decided to do an action, a work slow down. We decided to have a no pink day. A day when we danced with our legs closed. Management responded by making an example of one dancer. They fired Summer for participating in the action. We went to them and asked for Summer's job back. And when they wouldn't give back her job, we hit the streets in a picket. - This is our reality, honey. We trying to make a living, honey. Don't, don't try and keep us down. Don't try and keep us down. [women chant] - [Voiceover] No contract. - [Voiceover] No pussy. - [Voiceover] No contract. - [Voiceover] No pussy. - No contract. - [Voiceover] No pussy. - No contract. - No pussy. - [Voiceover] No contract. - [Voiceover] No pussy. - [Voiceover] Excuse me, would you like a flyer sir? - [Voiceover] [chant] We want Summer, not misuse of power. We want summer, not misuse of power. - They have wives, they don't honk. They by themselves, they honk. - I wish the male could do it, but ya know, personally I don't think I have the body for it. I'm sure their supporting themselves, their family, their kids, their significant other, however you wanna go, supporting themselves through school. I have no problem with it myself, but then I'm a man, and this is a women's' issue. - Are you gonna call the number and tell the Lusty you support our union and.. - Sure, what would you like me to say? - I'd like you to say that you go to the Lusty Lady. But that, that you won't go there until they rehire Summer. The women they fired for union activity, who is right here with her son. - Hey what's up tiger? - [Voiceover] While we were picketing outside the theater, some of the dancers on stage were trying to encourage the customers to leave. - [Voiceover] Well because I didn't want my bosses to know that I was doing this, but I also wanted the customers to know what had happened. I wrote "Please don't spend money here, unfair labor" on my hands and showed them when I was doing my show. So that the customers would go. - [Voiceover] And how did the customers react? - [Voiceover] They nodded their heads, waiting for their money to spend out what was already in and went home. - The last customer just left and the theater's empty. So maybe, uh, Summer's job will be restored, by this evening. - I need a shop story. - [Voiceover] Why? - Because they're closing the show until Tuesday. - I mean, we closed down their business and made them lose money, for like what, a few hours. And they're now gonna close down their business for three days. To say to you, "We're going to lose way more money, "to keep control over you." - They can just close it for no reason? - [Voiceover] They kept the video booths open, but closed the live show. It was a lock out. They were trying to scare us. - [Voiceover] Do you want to tell me why your going there? Do you really want to break a union? - [Voiceover] Two, four, six, eight, don't go in to masturbate. Two, four, six, eight, don't go in to masturbate. Two, four, six, eight, don't go in to masturbate. Two, four, six, eight, don't go in to masturbate. Two, four, six, eight, don't go in to master bate. - I just got off the phone with the management here and after telling them my name and phone number they still refused to even tell me their name they claim that there's another side to the story. That Summer was fired for reasons other than union activity. But they wouldn't confirm that it was because she missed shifts, it wasn't, they wouldn't confirm it was because of bad work. All they wanted to say was that there's two sides to every story. I advise them, as I'm sure their lawyers have advised them, there is severe civil penalties for lock outs and for union busting. And I as a, um, very dedicated and loyal customer um, and patron of the Lusty Lady for years have become more enthusiastic about my patronage since the establishment of this union. And if management continues in this vein, I'll never step foot in here again. - He's going to get a great show if we are allowed to organize it. - We'll, you know, we will always be happy about our loyal customers, that's all I can say. Thank you very much for being here. - Well it's, it's my pleasure ya know and just like any other workers here in America. Workers in the sex industry need to have the same rights and need to have the right to organize and unionize. - [Voiceover] The president of the company is right here at the door. She is the one we talked to in bargaining. Tell her what you think. - [Voiceover] You suck! [loud shout] Rehire Summer. Rehire Summer. Rehire Summer. Rehire Summer. Rehire Summer. Rehire Summer. Rehire Summer. - They're saying we did two illegal things. And we're saying they did two illegal things. They are saying we closed reps, for economic reasons were saying that's an illegal lock out. They're saying, "We fired Summer for breaking a rule." We're saying - [Voiceover] No rules' broken. - She didn't break a rule, and you made up the rule after you fired her. - Okay, so who's going? - [Voiceover] Decadence. - Decadence. Okay? - [Voiceover] You sure you okay with that? - [Decadence] Yeah, I feel okay with that. I just want to, um, like how do we the building goes up to, where are you? 27? - Okay. You tell me it's your building. I have no idea. - [Voiceover] After hours of brute-less arguing about who broke the law, management finally agreed to an off the record discussion. - Woohoo! - [Voiceover] What just happened? - We got her job back. - [Voiceover] You just got her job back? [women cheering] - [Voiceover] Oh thank you so much. Oh thank you so much. - [Voiceover] In the midst of bargaining, my mom calls. Well, she said, "Julia, this is your mother calling." Like I don't know her voice. She said, "I'm coming to San Francisco "I'm gonna stay with you for five days." Five days. And I looked around my house and I thought oh my god, everything in my house is like, stripper. I clean out the house, it felt like Passover. Ya know, you have to get rid of all the bread. Ya know? Got rid of all the stripper gear. And then she's here and it's going pretty well, until we went outside. It was the one time in my life I ran into everyone from the peep show who I knew. But wasn't really good friends with. Because if you're really good friends with them, you know their real name. Instead, we're running into three girls and I'm just about to say it. And I hear it in my head before I say it. I'm like, "Mom, these are my friends Cayenne, Coco, Cinnamon, and Octopussy. [laughter] Thankfully there was like instant stripper, you know, ESP. I'm like, "Hi, this is my mom. "Mom..." And they go, "Hi I'm Jane. "And I'm Mary. "I'm Peggy Sue." My mom's like, "They're such lovely girls." One day my mom walks in with Scarlet Harlot. Saying, "Julia, I want you to meet the famous prostitutes' rights activist, Scarlet Harlot." Scarlet says, "You're Joyce's daughter?" I say, "Yes, you know me from a benefit where we both performed." I look at her with big pleading eyes and whisper "Scarlet, please don't tell my mother." Scarlet says, "Your out to everyone except your mother?" I wondered why I can tell my mom I was gay, but not a stripper. My mom and I were both fighting for sex workers. I wanted her to see us as allies, as on the same side. We were both feminists. But feminists have disagreed about the sex industry for years. Some people say the sex industry is oppressive to all women. And some people say that working in the sex industry can be empowering. But after hours of dancing and watching hundreds of men come and go, I just found it boring. - I was active in the women's movement, you know, in the 60's. And one of the founders of Berkeley women's liberation. And so the women that I talk to now who are in the union movement have lots of questions about all of you. And what's fascinating to me, is these are women in their late 40's who've been very politically active. Like for 20, 30 years. And they feel, you know, why would women do this work? They can't relate to it. And they're very curious when I explain how I feel very privileged that I'm getting to represent you in this bargaining. And how much I fell that I've grown and that you've taught me And how much I admire you for your courage because you really are pioneers in lots of ways. And it saddens me 'cause these are women I've been close to for years and years and sort of felt are my sisters. And I can see on this issue, that we're on very different paths. - It seems like a very simple issue to me. This is my body and these are my reproductive organs, and I'm gonna do with them as I please. And it seems strange to me that like another women would say, "Well yeah, "actually ya know what somebody can tell me whether, "what I can do with my body and what I can't do." That, it just, it doesn't fit. Because it's mine. It's not yours. - People assume, oh well see you guys are being exploited, you deserve it almost like. Don't you know exotic dancers are exploited whether not you want to believe it or not. And it's like, it's like yeah, but they're not exploited just because they're exotic dancers. It has to do with like the club's fucked up. The management fucked up. They're not getting their tips. If all that was in place, then no I don't think they would be exploited. Just because their job is like, selling pussy. - It was always my understanding that feminist perspective was about enabling women to have a choice. - [Voiceover] After we picketed, management suddenly started bargaining in earnest. They offered a raise and excepted a grievance procedure. We made some concessions as well. - Wages, we are willing to go down. We're gonna start at 14 for dancers, eight for [indiscernible] - [Voiceover] By month five we'd given up on getting health insurance and holiday pay. But we didn't want to give in on everything. Well wait sonority and laid off. - Union security is our number one priority. We want agency shop. - Agency shop is a big big issue. I mean the lawyer says they don't want to do agency shop. Period. It's like, they want to do a contract but they want open shop. - It was like reverse therapy or something, like [laughs] spending 12 hours in this horrible beige room. And just getting hammered for hours and hours and hours, that you're not gonna get this thing that you thought was so important to you. And that all these people are counting on you to get for them. - [Voiceover] That's what we want. - We said.. - Understand they can do that. They can come in and say this is it. We don't want to talk about it anymore we moved to our last best and final. - [Voiceover] Stephanie told us that we were running out of time. As we headed for the final days of bargaining, Decadence and I were invited to a conference to give a talk about unionizing exotic dancers. And I was asked to do some comedy, but when I got the program I saw that my mother was also giving a talk at the same International Conference on Prostitution. I asked the others if they had told their moms. - [Voiceover] What do they think you do now? - Ha ha, cocktail waitress. - The weekend that I was prepared to tell them they freaked out because I got a piercing. The thought I didn't raise you to mutilate yourself. You know, and I'm like, whoa they can't handle a belly button ring. They'll never handle me being a stripper, ya know. - I plan on telling my mom mainly because I think she's gonna find out. And also i think it's a plot device for the documentary. But... [laughter] - And you think is screwy huh? - She's just this incredible, incredible woman but throughout my youth, I mean, we just fought all the time. And I'm much closer with my mother now than I've ever been in my entire life. And I really love her. And I really care about her. And she calls me when she's upset about things. I'm worried about that she's gonna take it as a slap in the face. And I don't want to have to give up the good relationship that I've developed with her. But there's no way that everyone who's there is gonna keep it a secret for me. Ya know, what would I have to do? Distribute flyers? Please don't tell my mama. - [Voiceover] Decadence and I left negotiations for the conference. We met my mother in Santa Monica. She agreed to a video taped interview about our relationship and her work. But she kept putting the interview off. Insisting that we go sight seeing. - Oh look at the Hollywood sign, Julie. - [Voiceover] I figured she knew something was up. You'll comfort my mother after I come out to her about being a sex worker. - You're coming out to your mother finally. The very famous Joyce Wallace, I love that. I am waiting. She, here's this woman, she's like the most famous in the country for doing out reach to women on the streets. Your her daughter, she doesn't know, it's just so interesting. - I know that your worried that I'm gonna make a revelation to you that your gonna hate. - Yeah. - It's not that bad. - You better make it now. - Okay, I'm not only making a documentary about the LL dancers, I'm one of them. And all of my creative work that... - And this is only strip tease? - Yeah, it's no contact with customers. - I'm not upset about this as a revelation. Okay? - Okay. - I would be really upset with prostitution. I really feel that's, that for a woman to allow a man into her body, who she has not chosen and she has not cared about is demeaning. - Well - And i know that's not a popular thing to say at a prostitution conference. And I have to qualify it by saying that's the way I feel for myself. and that's certainly the way I would feel for my daughter. - I think your work is wonderful and I'm so proud of you and I love you so much. And I didn't want to have any lies with you. But I was quite willing to keep this a lie, I didn't really need to tell you this. But we're both at the conference and I'm presenting and I'm doing comedy about other work that I use to do in the industry. Which is, I was a professional dominatrix for a while. - Oh god. Well I'm not kind, you know, real feeling good about this. I came to this conference as somebody who is gonna present and I don't want to have attention for anything else other than my work. - Well I don't present, I don't do comedy under your name. I do comedy [indiscernible] - So let's keep it that way and um, maybe not. Now as you see, you put me in an awkward position because I don't want to tell people that your not my daughter. You are my daughter. And I don't want it known that Doctor Wallace from New York, who is an expert has a, uh um, a daughter who's in the smut business. - But I'm, what you did is help women - No I think it takes away from my professional message and my professional is - Your professional message is that women on the streets didn't have to be... - I think you should not have come to this meeting. - No. - I think you should not present at this meeting. - Mama, I present about being a union worker, you're proud of that. - No I'm not proud of you being at this meeting presenting. - You're proud of Christina holding the camera, who should be closer by the way. - It's good your telling me now. - I needed to tell you before the conference happened. - It would've been nice to tell me a long time before. - But you didn't want to know. You came and visited me. You saw all my shoes. Why didn't you notice? - Just a lot of boots. - And we have to swallow pride in almost every kind of work. But it is much better to work with your mind than with your body. - I agree. - So why aren't you doing that? You have a first class mind. And it bothers me that you have never put yourself into a position where you could earn a living except now by taking off your clothes for odd men. - Well that's not true. I went to graduate school and was a very good graduate student and could've been decent at that. - You left it. - I left it because it was not what I wanted to do. We weren't talking just about sex work anymore. - You don't rewrite history. - It was the fight. The same old fight. The same old dance. Don't tell me that I never ever put myself in a position of being someone you could be proud of. - It's not... - [Voiceover] Each of us wondering, am I a good mother? Am I a good daughter? [violin music] My mom said that I shouldn't tell people that I was her daughter. She started wearing dark glasses to cover her swollen eyes. Despite feeling shell shocked, we still had our work to do. - I'm telling ya, that I'm talking about a population that is very different from almost everything you have seen at this meeting. I do not work with beautiful glamorous women who wear push up bras. - I had to come out to my mother today about being in the industry. And I just told her I do work for social justice. I'm a professional dominatrix. - I work with women who are wearing everything they own on their back. Who have not eaten in a long time. - Maybe you've seen my ads? I'm Mistress Yente. There's an ad. I'm in full, you know, thigh high leather boots. And I'm holding a crop and it says "Call me, or I'll just sit here in the dark." - And when we examined the data, we were shocked to find that those women who perform more fallacio than vaginal sex were more likely to be infected. - After getting paid to give golden showers, now, every time I pee, I feel jipped. - We gave out half a million condoms last year. So I like to think that we're responsible for one half a million safe sex acts in New York City. - Strippers are a really interesting group to organize. They're very kind of classy, they really got a, a real cowboy mentality. - [Voiceover] On the last day of the conference, Decadence and I gave our talk. I was happy that my mother, still in her dark glasses, attended. - [Voiceover] So where we are now in the negotiating process, we've been in bargaining for five months. We have won many things that we didn't have before. And we also have a written guarantee that the one way windows will remain out of the theater. - [Voiceover] At the end of the conference, my mother stood in the parking lot with me. I wanted her to be proud of my union work. She started to cry. She said she wasn't proud of me. She drove away and didn't return my calls for three months. - We've come to a point at the table at which we are at in pass. They're not gonna move anymore. - [Voiceover] We met with the rank and file to find out what they would be willing to strike over. - We need to be able to say without bluffing "If we don't get this, we'll walk." - I wouldn't want to strike over a sick day. That's the only thing that, if we were to strike, is that agency shop. - I personally, there's points like I would give in on the paid holiday. But if it were to come down to striking on any of the points that anybody felt strongly about I'd be behind them and I'd be striking it. - [Voiceover] All of us agreed that we had to have agency shop and a sick day. But when we returned to negotiations management presented us with a last best and final offer, that included a sick day but not agency shop. - Yeah, they've got to accept our agency shop. - If we don't get agency shop, I think we should strike. - [Voiceover] Normally a last best and final offer is non-negotiable. You accept it or strike. But we didn't give up. We made a counter offer. - I just wanted to like shake them, you know. Do you want a strike? We don't want to strike. You don't have to let this happen. - [Voiceover] All day long and into the night offers and counter offers went back and forth. - [Voiceover] So it's, um, 20 to midnight. - It's never gonna end. - [Voiceover] And we thought we had a deal. - [Voiceover] Oh yeah. - And now they're changing the deal. So who knows what's gonna happen. - [Voiceover] Okay, here I am in the room again. - [Voiceover] Finally, management brought us their final last and best and final offer. - All I wanna go away from here is with a contract. And I'm not happy with it either. But it's gonna give us more to work with in the future. - [Voiceover] I agree. - I think we've fought too long to risk losing everything. - We're all kind of coming to a consensus but really not feeling good about you not being here. - [Voiceover] Someone else explain it. - Here. - It's called Maintenance of Membership. - [Voiceover] There final offer was a compromise, between agency shop and open shop, called Maintenance of Membership. New employees wouldn't have to join the union but we would meet with each new worker to explain why he or she should. And once the did they were protected from management bullying or bribing them into quitting the union. - We do know if we agree to this we get a contract. If we strike, we may get something much better or we may get something worse. Okay? Alright, bye. Okay? Consensus? - It's gonna make us work and that and I think that, maybe in the back of my mind I wanted to believe that when this was all over I could rest. [laughing] I know it's a ridiculous thing. But in a sense this keeps us honest because we do have to keep doing the work to create a better work environment for people in the sex industry. - [Voiceover] All that remained was for the workers to vote on the contract. - We ready? - [Voiceover] Yup. - Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. - No. - [Voiceover] Oh. - Wow. - And a yes. - 71 yeses and one no. [cheering] - [Voiceover] We became the only union strip club in the United States. [upbeat music] As word of our success spread, we got calls from dancers in almost every state in the union. Dancers who wanted to organize their clubs too. I flew to Philadelphia to meet the dancers who were organizing there. - We heard like, drips and drables of you know, there was a union for exotic dancers and isn't that funny. Well you know what? No, it's not funny. - What they did was decided, okay we're gonna give the girls a weeks notice or a week and a half notice and that's it, and they no longer get a salary. Well that's what got us going. - So we called the labor department, fair wage and hour, the department of justice, and the IRS. And we got all these forms and information and then we got the thing going. You know, we have all the other girls signing a petitions right now. - We already have the customers who say they won't cross that they'll walk. - [Voiceover] Yeah, 90 percent of our costumers are union. - [Voiceover] Really? - Yeah, they're all union people. They will not cross a picket line. - I wanna go to work with a teamsters bumper sticker on my uh - [Voiceover] Cooch. - Yeah, wear it across my chest. That's my new work uniform. - Yeah slap that right across here. How you like these? - [Voiceover] Jane and I flew to Alaska to work on a campaign in Anchorage. What the did was fire the first five main activist then blocked everyone else out the next day. They fired the people before they talked to their lawyer and really fucked up. Pretty much said it was because of union activity. Said something like. - [Voiceover] I'm gonna shut this place down before I let a union control my money. - We've been financing these two men's' extremely posh room with food too long. I can't pay for my son's hospital bills when he broke his arm. But the owner can have a 20,000 dollar birthday party for his six year old. And I've never seen him do a table dance or deal with the smelly old drunk. - Did it heal? - [Voiceover] Say thank you boys. - [Voiceover] Thank you. - [Voiceover] Thank you. - [Voiceover] Bye Jonathon. - See you next time when I break my other arm. - [Voiceover] Okay [laughs]. - [Voiceover] The National Labor Relations Board is investigating our charges of unfair labor practices against the Showboat. - Do you have an intent to organize letter in our case file? Okay so that, so - [Voiceover] The Lusty Lady inspired the Showboat girls to unionize, hopefully the Showboat girls will inspire. The New York girls to unionize, the New York girls will inspire. Indiana girls to unionize and so forth. And hopefully it'll be a nationwide thing. - When they were trying to fight unemployment - What did unemployment say? - Some kind of legal shit. - I didn't even try. I figured that - [Voiceover] Excuse me Mom. - [Voiceover] What? - Um, why every day do you get fired? - 'Cause mom's a super hero. And I'm fighting the bad guys. - So I sit on the corner here handing out flyers for the EDA benefit. And the guys in big suits came out and informed us that we weren't allowed to be here. And they were all like glaring at us. And it was very clear that I will never get a job on Broadway, but that's okay. 'Cause now my mama knows what I do and I'm not allowed to do it anymore. She told me that. She called me up the other day, she said, "You're not allowed to do that anymore." So thank you mama. - Well I don't know that I'm proud of. I mean, I'm proud of her because she's smart, and witty, and with it, and uh, very independent. And she looks good and you never know what to expect next. Um, I'm not proud of her because she's a stripper. She was always independent, strong, stubborn, difficult. You know, so I'm glad that she empowered or helped to empower these women to make their working conditions better. I like to see it as a civil liberties issue. - You know I've always been strong and feisty and uh, aggressive. If I hadn't been part of a union effort I wouldn't have as much control over my working conditions. And it didn't matter how aggressive, or Jewish, or smart, or witty, or, or, you know, strong I was. Personality didn't provide me with good working conditions. Being part of a group, organizing successful union effort did. - Now I think you should go out and unionize other industries. [laughs] Do you remember the time with Grandma when you were five years old? No. Well you were running around the house naked. And uh, my mother said to you, "You have to put something on. "You should be ashamed." And I really, I just took her by the shoulders and I said, "Never, ever tell my child she should have shame." I was so upset with that. And um, I think ya over did it. [laughing] It's okay.
