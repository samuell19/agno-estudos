THE CAREER OF A CHAMBERMAID Hello? Yes. Yes. Yes, my love. I understand. Fabrizio! You brought the violin! No! Yes? Yes, dear. The girl? High fever? I'll be right there. Fabrizio... THE END VENICE FILM FESTIVAL Who did you see? Osvaldo Valente, Vittorio de Sica, Amedeo Nazzari? No, I haven't seen them. - That's Loretta Mari! - It's true. How beautiful she is! What are you doing, busybodies? You still have to clean the entire floor. I'm coming, ma'am, but first I want to see Franco Denza. Calm down. Let me breathe! How handsome he is! - Just like in the movies. - Okay. Thank you. - What are you doing, Mr. Luciani? - What do you think I'm doing? I saw that you were falling, and I held onto you. - Just so you could grab my ass! - And that's the thanks I get? I saved your life and that's how you reward me. - Listen. Wait... - No, let me go, I'm on duty! But if you're on duty, then I am a client... Come on, come on. I have tons of things to tell you. I am someone in the cinema and I could make you rich, instead of working here as a maid. Come here and let me give you a kiss. Let me go, Mr. Luciani! I know who I am. I am of weak character and I can't say no. - Then tell me yes! - No way. Because if the boss finds out, I'm fired. Good. Then I'll take you to Rome and present you to everyone. Okay, in Rome. I'll go to Rome, you'll put me in a movie, and then in Rome, I swear, I'll surrender to you. But not here. Don't you trust me? Look, you could have as many as you want. Look in the mirror. You know how Loretta Mari started? With someone who said: "Come to Rome to make movies" Walk, let me see you walk. Come on, sweetheart. Like a model. Bravo, like that. Your perfume. Feel its enchanting scent. Come. Let's dance. Have you seen how Clark Gable kissed Claudette Colbert in "It Happened One Night? Like this. Take off those rags! The maid's uniform is an insult for a body like yours. - But what are you doing, Mr. Luciani? - Trust me. And remember that making love is good for the skin, And it helps the career! - No, not the panties! Don't be so materialistic, Mr. Luciani! Now I must go to the gala dinner, since this is the last night and there will be an awards ceremony. But upon arriving in Rome, I'll call you, and I will make you a queen of the 7th art. - What? - 7th art, the cinema. The film and I are inseparable. Here is my business card. I'll call you soon. Farewell, I'm leaving. And clean up a little. Look at this mess! - You're shameless! - You're a brute! - I know what you've done with that Roman. - It's not true, that's slander. - It's not slander! I saw you! - He jumped on me! But I defended myself, I swear. I hit him so hard he fell out of bed! Take that, you liar! But why do you put out for everyone except me? Because I love you. You say you love me, but you give me nothing... ...and yet you give everything to strangers! I told you I didn't want to, you must believe me. We can not get married if you don't trust me. As soon as I put my hand on your thigh, you say "Hold it". I said it to him, too. Is it my fault if he continued? Hold it. It's your fault! You and me...It was a beautiful story, but you ruined it all. You hear what I'm saying? I will not marry you! - Come on, Marcella. - I would have married you even though you're poor, but a brute like you, I do not want! - Marcella... - Leave me alone. You obsessive pig! Cowardly brute! Help! Can he swim? More or less. Marcella! Luigino, would you let me make a call to Rome? Calls cost. What will you give me? A kiss, like last time. The last time it was a local call to Venice. This is long distance, my dear. To call Rome, I have to see at least one titty. - Is this Mr. Luciani? - It's me. Who is it? Is that you? Mr. Luciani? It's Marcella from Venice. Remember? Of course I remember! How are you? Why don't you come to Rome? What are you still doing there? Expecting your call. - Well, I called. - No, you haven't called me. Well, whatever. We're waiting for you with open arms. I am at your disposal, whenever you decide to come. Bye, beautiful! Hey! Will you stop sitting in my chair when I'm not here?! I'm sorry, sir. It was my mother who is unwell. Now go buy a pack of Macedonia Extra cigarettes and three bills of exchange to make payments. Sir, do you know how the film "Santa Lucia of Napoli" did at the box office yesterday? - Please, I'd rather you not tell me. - Alright. He told me to go to Rome, he'll take care of everything. - You have to pay for the call, right? - Right, and I'll pay! - This call lasted 3 minutes. - Sorry, but I have only two! You have to be careful, Marcella. Rome is a big city And the bigger the city, the more disgusting it is. It's hard for a girl to stay pure. And if I ever came to know something bad about you, you know what I would say: "Better to be a whore than a slave." That's what I'd say. Yes, exactly that. I am an honest woman, and what did I get? Working since the age I was able to walk, and I still work while death is near. The only fun I had in my life was when I went to Padova, to visit your father in the hospital. That's why I'm telling you: "Go quickly, my child." Go as far as possible from this misery. You should not end up like me. - Mom! - What? - My money is gone! - Right. More than right. The money is gone, it's empty! Holy mother of God! Your father had to find them. That's why he hasn't been home for a few days. Damn it! Tell me how will I go to Rome now? That's your father coming home with your money,... ...except now it's in liquid form. What a disaster! So, will you marry me or not? I'd cut my balls before I married one like you...! Yeah, I'll marry you! You are a man of character. - So, you'll take me to Rome? - Why? We are lucky to live in Venice. It will be the best honeymoon in the world. - Right, Nano? - You bet, they'll come all the way from Padova to see it! But if we were married in Rome, Mussolini would come to our wedding. - Why? Is he related to you? - And what does that matter? All those who marry on the anniversary of the revolution... ...get a free trip and a thousand lire prize. If you take me to Rome, I will put out before we get married. Damn, how wonderful! When do we leave? Are you crazy? Are you sick? - Surrender now! - Nano is watching us. I don't see or hear anything. Help me. You weigh a ton. Stay close to me. Don't get lost. This Fascist Italy that has drained the swamps, this universal Rome, where the flags wave from the crowning works, welcomes the bride and groom of the regime. - Who is it? - Must be the Duce. - Tomorrow... - Like hell! ...religious ceremony will take place. Go to your barracks immediately. Men on the right and women on the left. And remember: Tonight we do not fuck! - You want the bag? - No, thank you. Keep it yourself. - See you later! - Goodbye! - See you at dinner. - Goodbye! - What are you doing, bride? Running away? - Be right back! Littoria Productions I'll give you 3 lire, but you have to wait for me and drive me again later. - I don't understand, but okay. - Great. Excuse me. Mr. Luciani, please? - Answer! Is he or is he not here? - Who? Luciani, Littoria Films. No one. They're "cooked". - How do you say? -They're are all gone. - And where have they moved? - To jail. - I have no desire to go to sleep. - Neither do I. And if we would join our men in their barracks? Margherita, wait! Stop right there! What a shock. - What are you doing here? - I had to go on an errand. - And you? - I watch the cannon. - And why? - Because I like guns. Unlike me. They frighten me. Does this scare you too? Answer! So be it. Ah, la, la, silly billy! Ah, la, la? - Does this scare you? - No, I think you're a little crazy. We Fascists are all crazy, don't you know? Eccentric. Let me see that face. I can read your heart. You are unhappy, doll. - How can you tell? - You don't feel like marrying that prick fiance of yours. Not true! - You know him? - I saw you together. Well, I have to go. Good night. Wait. Did you like it? - But I don't kiss like that. - And how do you kiss? With my mouth open. Like this. Look at those two! - But where are you going? Wait! - You have to guard the cannon! Cannon can take care of itself! Heel, Caesar, damn your ancestors! And you, bright hope of the new Italy, pacified by man of Providence, to you which give children to the homeland, and children to Jesus. - In this Rome, where the vicar of the Holy Church... - Father, there's 2000 couples. Let's start! The first two. - Stefania Rocca, you agree to marry Sandro? - Yes - And you, Sandro, you agree to marry Stefania? - Yes Rings. I now pronounce you husband and wife, on behalf of the father... Next couple! Do you, Tiziana Barbanti accept Enrico Abate...? - Yes - And you, Enrico Abate, Tiziana Barbanti? - Yes The rings.

Will you, Marcella Vallmarin marry Roberto Trevisan? - Yes. - And you, Roberto Trevisan, will you marry Marcella Vallmarin? - No! - Rings. What did you say?! I said no, because this woman is a fucking traitor! On the eve of our marriage, I was cuckolded by this black pig! Comrades! Leave me alone, you bastards! - Take your hands off! - May you all take it up the ass! Long live Benito Mussolini... Murderers, leave me alone! Dirty bastards! - Go on, father. - Roberto! Whore, fucking whore! Let me go, you bastards! Fear not, little one. I'm here. Wretched bastards! Where are you taking me? Can you answer my question? Nearby. And what are you doing? Why aren't you singing? March! {\i1}Roberto was sent as a volunteer, to the conquest of the empire,{\i} {\i1}and I became a friend of Lieutenant Bruno. {\i} {\i1}My horoscope had predicted good luck, health, {\i} {\i1}and a happy encounter with a Leo... {\i} {\i1}and Bruno was a Leo.{\i} {\i1}At least that was his zodiac sign.{\i} Tell me you're a Red! A disgusting Red! - I am a Red. - A nasty Red! - A nasty Red. - And now, fall down! Bravo, Mr. Bruno. You're so fit. I'm always in shape. Long live the Duce. Will you close the damn window? Wake up, honey. As the sun rises Mussolini goes horseback riding! A little air to the underside, and then a well deserved rest after the gymnastics. Come, my mare, I will mount you. I don't feel like it in the morning. I have no desire... and I have low blood pressure. Well, I love to do it in the morning. I am a beast! I have a roaring panther in my pants! Why can't your panther roar at night? Come on, let me. Okay, but do it quickly. Damn it! All this hesitation made me flabby. Fuck! Even better. Enough of carnal pleasures, said the Federale. Stop living comfortably! Ottilio, one knocks before entering! - What if I had been fucking? - Excuse me. - You've run out of honey? - There is blackberry jam. For you I'm just a carnal pleasure? At first you made many promises: "I'll introduce you to this one, to that one..." and it turns out for you I'm just a carnal pleasure! Don't you understand that I am a soldier, a fighter? I am a falcon, bitch! An eagle flying in the clouds! By the Virgin! Today here, tomorrow there. If I'm told: "Comrade, we're going to battle with the Reds, and smash the Abyssinians! " "Take your clubs, and let them taste the wood! " What should I tell them? "I can not because I have to take care of my concubine "? What are you trying to say? I mean, I can not be tied to a cruel fate. - I'll take you to safety. - What? I'll take you to my mother. Enrichetta, nice to see you. What about Mom? I'll call her right away, Mr. Bruno.

Not only women are whores. Auf Wiedersehen. Goodbye, Maria Luisa. Do you accept this woman here as your wife...? Yes. And you, do you accept him as your husband...? What a scoundrel... What a joke. Asshole! It wasn't a joke. I wanted to know if you still loved me. Well, then I inform you that I don't, and I never did! That's what I wanted to hear.

Marcella, wait! Marcella! - Give me a kiss. - We are in a church! I love you. But when I think you cheat on me continuously, I get a heartache! Because I have always been faithful. Ah, you're faithful? And what were you doing at that place where you found me? That was just pure instinct. There were no emotions involved. I have also never betrayed my feelings. I've always thought of you. Always. I don't care if you think of me when you go to bed with another! What do I say: "Meet my fiance, we met in a brothel!" My children, I am confessing. We're sorry. You're a pig, a scoundrel. And to think I was going to leave everything to come with you, and you can't do anything but insult me and talk about the past that I put behind me! Marcella, wait. No, I'm done with you. You're too materialistic for me. And besides... you are unable to forgive. Drive. Marcella, wait! Slut! {\i1}When you go through the street{\i} {\i1}With all your grace, {\i} {\i1}and your beautiful eyes {\i} {\i1} everyone says: {\i} {\i1}Bim Bum Bamba what a pretty girl. {\i} {\i1}Bim Bum Bamba Bim Bum Bamba,{\i} {\i1}Bim Bum Bamba What a girl so...{\i} - I have no inspiration, Mom. - Take your drops, sweetie. {\i1}Life with an artist is sometimes difficult. {\i} {\i1} Gondrano was a great artist. {\i} {\i1}After the "Shoemaker's Waltz" and "Vagabond Fifer", {\i} {\i1}He was now composing{\i} {\i1}"Bim Bum Bamba, what a pretty girl."{\i} Here, honey.

Risotto made with white wine, with lemon. - Hello. - Mr. Denza. - My table. - Please. The truth is that deep inside, I have always felt very lonely. At the end of the day, what is success and money, if our heart does not love? You said that you also work in show business. So you perfectly understand the meaning of the saying: "You have to smile when the heart is cold. " - Right? - Yes - I sing in the "Happy Trio". - Good. And in commercials for "Amaro Cola". "Amaro Cola"! A good digestive, although I prefer cognac, and even whiskey from time to time. Go, angel. - It lifts your spirits! - What should I bring you? - What will you have to drink, dear? - You decide. Bring whatever you want, I trust you. No, you shouldn't be so polite, you should... - Be impolite. - Impolite... No, let's be on first-name basis! We're friends, right?

Did you like it? I haven't seen it. Well, forget the cinema. Let's talk about you, all about you. Which one of my films you like the most? Tell me. - All. - Is this wine alright? Yes, but serve Luisella first. - Marcella! - Marcella... - Chin-chin, pigeon. - Chin-chin. - A kiss? - What? So soon? I, wild guy. You, young lady. Wild guy kiss young lady. Magnificent! Vermicelli with clams. The first rule in winning a woman is to provide a good meal. Good, good, good. Young man, wake up! Serve the lady. You want some, ma'am? Yes, thank you. What are you doing? - Disgraceful! - Sorry, I got distracted. Murderer, pig! Slut, you do it with everyone but me! - I've always remained faithful in heart. - Ah, in heart? All the while you're swapping spit with this suckling pig! - Now, now, young man.. - It was you who left me. Not really, it was just out of spite! What an excuse. Then I too am doing it out of spite. - Check, please! - Traitor! I'm sick of you! I'm sick of life! Enough! - It's over. I'm going to kill me! - Oh, dear! You'll have my death on your conscience. He'll kill himself for real! Check! I have to go! Help! Someone help, he can't swim! Roberto! Oh, my God... Roberto, my love! Save him! Anna Maria, come! There is a guy drowning! - Where? - There he is! Give him a blow on the head! - Come on, slowly.. - Roberto! Oh, my God... Is he alive? Roberto... Put him here. Is he alive? Don't leave me, Robero! I've always loved you! I'm your love, your true love. - Roberto, don't do this! - The Duce! - Duce, Duce! - The Duce! Long live Mussolini! Viva! Hey, what are you doing? Take this idiot away. Roberto! Long live the Duce! {\i1}It was him. In person. The Duce.{\i} {\i1}The Lighthouse of the Fascist Italy.{\i} - What happened? - A suicide, your excellence. Must be an antifascist, because the regime condemns suicide. What about you? Who are you, young Italian? Me? I'm the bride of a man who tried to kill himself, your excellence. I beg you, forgive him. - What's that? Blood? - Tomato, excellence. I beg you, forgive him. I say and I authorize myself to repeat that I like the woman who defends her man. - Come see me at Palazzo Venezia. - Yes, sir. I'll give you some guidelines. - Where are you from? - Conegliano, Venice. - Population? - I don't know. It does not matter! Duce, give a kiss to my son! Thank you. Long live the Duce! Thank you. Roberto! Oh, sorry. Hi, Roberto. Roberto. - May I take this chair? - Of course. I brought you some candy. Here, kid. Why treat me like this? What do you want? Why did you come? To see how you're doing. They took 7 liters of water out of me. I feel better. And now that you know, you can go. Roberto, you make me suffer when you talk like that. I know that life has separated us. A cruel fate has sought to divide us, but I have always loved you... and if you reject me, I... I... Are you crying? No, the water keeps coming out. The past is dead, Roberto. I forgive you. I forgive you everything, everything! You forgive me? Let it be, come on. You're a slut, but I will love you forever. Can't you talk to me differently? You always insult me. Don't you know that luck often gets born from misfortune? For example, a fortunate thing happened to me, you know? - Fortunate? - Yes, in Ostia. Right where you tried to commit suicide. Do you know who was there? The Duce. The Duce himself! In person! Yes, and he spoke to me, and... We got to like one another, and he told me to visit him. - You talked with the Duce? -Yes, I'm telling you... His eyes... They look like car headlights! He gave me goosebumps. - And you said you were going to see him? - Yes, Palazzo Venezia. Certainly. What's more, I told him of you, and he said he'd find you a good job. A good job, and even a house. - So we can get married. - Married? - Roberto... - You're deluded. Have faith, Roberto. My heart tells me... ...that a lucky period has begun for us. I have to go now. Do you need anything? No. Shall I stretch the sheets for you? You want some water? Forgive me. Goodbye. I'll see you in the evening. Goodbye. - You're Roberto Trevisan? - Yes Sign here. - What is it? - Don't ask questions and sign. VOLUNTARY ENLISTMENT FOR SPANISH FRONT You found me a job? Sister, bed bottle! - See that you don't break it again. - I'll try. Bravo! Bravo! {\i1}My encounter with the man who had turned Italy{\i} {\i1}into a peaceful and respected country changed my life.{\i} {\i1}One summer afternoon,{\i} {\i1}while his wife and children were on vacation at the beach...{\i} {\i1}...In a grove, far from the prying eyes of his bodyguards, I was his.{\i} Come here, golden ass! {\i1} At the climax, I said, "Excellence, I'm arriving."{\i} {\i1}and he laughed like crazy. {\i} {\i1}To me, Duce was the man of providence, as the priests say.{\i} {\i1}In fact, thanks to him, my dream was fulfilled.{\i} {\i1}Before my very eyes, the golden door of Cinecitta opened.{\i} Welcome, ma'am. Welcome. - I'm Bisanti, the producer. - Nice to meet you. The director of Cinecitta... Our director, Scandiani. Join me, ma'am. They told us by phone you'd be arriving, and we've arranged everything for testing. - My fox! - The fox, the fox! The audition can be done immediately. It's a modern film. A story of passion and luxury in the world of upper middle class. Your partner is the great actor Franco Denza. - Franco Denza? We're friends! - Really? Even better. He is about to arrive. You can audition with him, right? - What do you think, Scandiani? - Yes, I totally agree. - Lights! Lights! - Turn them on! - Tighten the focus a bit. - This is the dialogue. "These verses you have written to me, my love, have perfumed my heart like a bouquet of roses and anemone. - Sorry? - You pronounced it wrong. - Yes - Silly! No, no, you can say it that way too. Everyone says it like so. - How do you say it? - Like the girl. - That's it. - I'm here! I came from Paris! Hi, guys. Paris, what a great city. French women are great bitches, they sucked my soul. Here, Scandiani, this is for you. Art cinema, almost like yours. It comes from the Place Pigalle. You'll see it tonight. And this is for our old man. An oitment, which applied on the right place, produces an erection... With all due respect to the officers! - Franco, dear! - I am Beppe. - Whatever. - Come here. Meet your new partner: Marcella Vallmarin. But we have met before, right? - Yes, in Ostia. In a restaurant. - That's it! A night full of stars, and... stars. - The raging waves. Very suggestive... - No... What do you do for a living, baby? What do you do? - Well... - Right, you're an actress, huh? In Italy it is easy to make a career. A sinple recommendation and... Graceful. Very graceful. And why not? If you qualify, I'm ready. The script! Give me the script! My hat! - We are on page 81. - Very nice. Very cute. Here it is, ma'am. "To see you after so long in this room, which knew the days of our love. " "Oh, God..." "Oh, God..." "I feel like I love you, even more than before! " - It's your turn, Franco. - Lower it. Lower it more. "The past is dead, Adelaide." "From now on, nothing can separate us. " "Feel my heart beating." - "Wrap me in your arms!" - But this is not possible. It's not possible. It's a joke! Where did you find her? I understand that she's a beginner, a bad actress, but there's a limit to everything. How can you think that I, Franco Denza, can accept to act as a partner to a silly girl recommended by some petty general, to satisfy his lustful desires. It's a question of professional ethics! I do not care who recommended her! I don't care! - The Duce recommended her. - Who recommended her? - The Duce. - Okay, but this is not... Franco, you gotta help me out if not we're all finished. Enough, enough! Therefore... Well... you're nice. You're still a little green, but that's okay. It's nice, this ingenuity, this freshness. Let us return to page 81. Come on, begin. "I feel like my heart is beating." "Wrap me in your arms and kiss me." Good! Her intonation is better! Shall we continue, Sendiani? No need, now comes the kiss. The kissing scene. The kissing scene? We'll do the kissing scene. We'll sacrifice ourselves! Sorry. No hard feelings. It's good! She's responding. She puts her own.. {\i1}I would have killed him for how he had offended me in front of everyone{\i} {\i1}but instead, I changed my mind. {\i} {\i1}I kissed him the way Velleda had taught me,{\i} {\i1}She was a gypsy I met in the brothel.{\i} {\i1}Franco and I felt, as the poet wrote, {\i} {\i1}"As if Cupid had launched his arrows". {\i} {\i1}I realized that Franco was the man of my life.{\i} {\i1}We decided to go on a honeymoon. {\i} {\i1}We should have went to Polynesia,{\i} {\i1}but instead, we ended up in a hotel in Terminillo.{\i} {\i1}It was snowing and we were not alone.{\i} Sir, the snow is gone. What should we do? Okay, let's do the close-ups. Put the camera here. {\i1}While they changed the scenography, we made love there in front of everyone.{\i} {\i1}Nobody noticed.{\i} Wanna bet that these two are fucking? No, no, ma'am Montini! You're wrong again! But it is very simple, by God: H2O. Where's your head? You're not in love, by any chance? Come on, smile. {\i1}I was called Alba Doris now. I had specialized in simple romantic roles.{\i} {\i1}I had become the ingenue of Italian cinema.{\i} Asshole! Why didn't you put a handkerchief in my pocket? - Where's your head? - Here it is. And now I have a long monologue. You wrote it on a sheet? I know it by ear, but just in case put it on her head. Let's see. All words with "R", as usual. Let's see... -Where is Franco Denza? - I'm coming! One can't even take a leak! Then, like this? - What a stink! You drank this morning? - Only mineral water. {\i1}Slate: Oasis of Glory, scene 27, 1st take.{\i} Farewell, my good lieutenant! Not farewell. Goodbye! 2nd cavalry company! Forward... march! Cut! This is cinema. - Look and learn, director man! - It is a work full of fatalism, ...a morbid film, unhealthy, as everything that comes from France! - I wasn't referring to you. - Gabriellino, Put on a jazz record, dear. Anybody want a cocktail, or "rooster's tail", as it's called in Italian? Black people have music in the blood. I get goosebumps, ... Look. - And tell me, Franco, Where did you buy these American discs banned in Italy? They are a gift from Vittorio Mussolini. Actually, this... ...this was brought to me by Italo from Brazil. Wanna try? Come on, it will do you good, you old witch. The truth is that Americans, British and French are old people. - And we're young! - And Americans are old, eh? Do these two American titties, with your permission, seem old to you? Franco, , please. Don't start with your crap. But I asked permission from her husband. Isn't that true? And friends share everything, including their wives. You're still making rifles for the Young Fascists? What a bargain. The regime has given me this task and I am very honored. It's true. Bravo, bravo. And you, beautiful hostess, what are you doing? Playing with the puppy? Mingle with our guests. The guests are entertained by you. You're so funny. Understood, dear. Marjory, sacrifice yourself for a noble contest. Alba Doris, alias Marcella Vallmarin of Conegliano, argues that her tits are not smaller than yours. Come on, show 'em! I beg you to excuse Mr. Denza... ...whose real name is, Luca Cioccetti. When he drinks too much, his brain gets scranbled.. Scrambled, my dear, with an "M". Oh, and if it were only the alcohol... ...With all the crap he takes, his brain turned into a mush. What is this, an evening in your honor? Idiot! Let's change the disc. Put in a national one. - Have you heard the latest rhyme? - Let's hear it. Costanzo and Tano Galeoco used sticks to climb our dicks. (?????) I heard you have a great factory, Is it true? In Genoa. But the real wealth are you - Women! The Italian woman is the first maker of world. Her duty is to give children to the country. Oh, poor Alba, you had to abort two months ago. You want to fight? You want me to air your dirty laundry? - What could you tell...? - Don't touch me! The little girl's got claws. Come on, get it off your chest! Let's hear all the tantrums and cries of this small shit of Italian cinema. Ah, really? Listen to what this impotent faggot drugged up to his eyebrows has to say. I've been putting up with you for 3 years. Clown! You succeeded because they dub your voice! You've got mush for brains! You can't remember any of your lines! You want me to give you a kick in the ass in front of everyone? I'd be happy to oblige. - Try it! - It costs me nothing. Remember that in the last film I had the top billing. Because you are the past. You're finished! You owe me everything! I made you an actress. You were a peasant working in the fields. That's what you did. Go and get out. A maid, that's what you were! Gabriellino, put on "Ziki Paki Ziki Pu". I took her out of the shit, and now she busts my balls. Out of the shit, literally! What's the matter, Marcella? What has happened to us lately? - What has happened is that you've changed. - No. I still love you. But I feel like I've lost you. I still love you too. But you never tell me that. Why? Why, why... You told me that with me you forget about everything. That you no longer had strange thoughts. Yes, yes, but... I don't know. - We must try to love each other. - Sure... Because we're alone. Yes, we're alone. {\i1}My God, how time flies... {\i} {\i1}Roberto... Where is he?{\i} {\i1}Will I see him again? Was I wrong about everything?{\i} Folks, pay attention! Before dinner we'll comply to our duty as Italians, and listen to the news. {\i1}Newsletter radio, Rome.{\i} {\i1}The Council of Ministers chaired by the Duce, has today made a historical decision. {\i} {\i1}The mayor has decreed that private companies will disappear. {\i} {\i1}All Italian factories with over a thousand workers{\i} {\i1}become the property of the state.{\i} {\i1}Nationalisation must take place within 24 hours.{\i} {\i1}those who don't comply will suffer severe penalties.{\i} {\i1}In severe cases, they will be sentenced to death by firing squad.{\i} But this isn't possible! It's the end of our country! We are finished! You dare dispute the Duce's decision? - What kind of man are you? - No, I don't dispute anything. Please! If Mussolini goes against the industrialists, it's the end. But he does it because he wants to ally with Russia, don't you understand? Hitler did it and now Mussolini wants to do it, too. No, no, no! Alright, alright! It was about time for all the parasites, including, if I may say so, yourselves, to realize that the bargain is over. No more, no more bargain, my lords. See what faces you make! Look, look, look! What a face! I have played you, it was a joke! A joke! It was a little glitch on a disc that I recorded myself. Come on, rejoice! You can continue filling your pockets without worry... - Oh, no! - Shal we call the police? - No, of course not. - Are you crazy? We'll get into trouble! What are you talking about? It was an innocent joke. He had his problems. He was weak, poor thing. He suffered from nervous exhaustion. - Come on, let's go. - That's life. Things happen. Let's not overreact. We can not do anything about it. Let's not get psychotic. Remain calm.. Here come the spaghetti. Come here, come here. Eat these great spaghetti with tomato, garlic and chilli. It would raise the dead. Let's stop with the philosophy. Follow me. No long faces, okay? Everybody to the table! You, too, great officer! Come, come. {\i1}The next day, Franco and I separated.{\i} {\i1}I haven't seen him again for a long time.{\i} {\i1}While Mussolini and Hitler were preparing the war,{\i} {\i1}I starred in "Father's Way", "Secretary For All",{\i} {\i1}and "My Heart is Ticking."{\i} {\i1} Roberto... where was he?{\i} {\i1}One day his postcard from Spain arrived.{\i} {\i1}saying only: "I'm fine."{\i} Damn, what a blow! - What side are you on? - Can't you see, I'm against. What about you? I am also against. - Are you Italian? - Yes, and you too, right? And how come we're not on the same side? I live in Barcelona. I'm here because I married a Spanish girl. And I'm here because I married an Italian. This is my wife. - Beautiful woman. - Beautiful and good too. - This is my girlfriend. - Very beautiful. Is it possible that we are countrymen and enemies at the same time? Damn! It shouldn't be like that, but it is. The war is bullshit. Are you...? Are you dead? What are you doing? No, mr. Fritz, you can't! Behave! Mr. Fritz! Teresa, the knife. Maestro, you have the honor of cutting our cake, please. Max, come. Thank you. I'm happy to have you as protagonist of this film that will mark a new beginning in friendship between our two peoples. I also raise my glass to the axis, linking German and Italian in their fight against communism. Because we are brothers, we are equal, we are alike. It's true. Excuse me a moment. Hello, Marcella... Sorry... Alba! What is this? You throw a party and don't invite me? I am very offended, you know? I almost didn't come. But where were you? I was in a clinic nearby. I went to detox, but I'm fine. And now I'm cured. - And so they let you leave? - Hello! Hey! - Come. - That's what I said. But they gave me no clothes. They said: "No clothes, because there are none". But nevertheless they let me go, and I left. Many people! Dear maestro, our famous director! I do not remember your name, but I'm a big fan of yours. - What is the name of this film you did together? - "Die Kameraden". - "Die Kameraden". - Come. Rest for a while and eat something. But there's light, there's music. I'm here with my German comrades... - Heil... What's the name of that...? - That who? That ox with mustache and forelock? - Come on, come on. - You are making a bad impression with our German comrades. Why don't you return to the clinic? What clinic? I said I'm cured! Look at my hand. Look. In that case, stay with us. Excuse me. See you. I'll be right back. This looks like a wake. Wake up, groundhogs! May I have a cigarette? Play some music, please! Hey, you. Come here. Come here, come and dance, cocksucker! If these two are dancing, two beautiful guys like us should dance too, right? - Franco, that's enough. - Out of the way. Franchino! Are you hurt? Come, I'll walk you out. - No. - I'm gonna take you to the clinic. Stay here. Sit. I don't need anyone with me. I'm going. I'm going to the clinic. Back to the clinic! At the clinic they love me, and everyone thinks like me! Yes, laugh, laugh! We'll lose this war. You'll lose! We're screwed, all of us. We are all dead. The world is over! Kaputt! We will pay dearly! Long live the Jews! My mother was Jewish! - We'll talk again! - Mr. Franco, your coat! - What coat? Bring it here. - Your coat, Mr. Franco. You want me to accompany you by car? No, I'm going by myself. Don't worry. All kaputt. You're screwed! Everyone! Good morning, Miss Doris. - Good morning. - Miss Doris Welcome to Hotel Excelsior. - Thank you. - Miss Doris, would you grant me an interview? - Of course. I'd be delighted. This way. You are beautiful. You've caused a sensation! Have you booked the suite that Loretta Mari was staying in? Of course, darling! Your wish is my command. - Have you seen the way she acts all high and mighty? - I remember when she was like us. What a snob! Have you seen how many flowers, honey? Let's see... "Count Volpi of Misurata." What about these? "The mayor of Venice." And the telegram! Whose flowers are these? My God, it's his telegraph! I'll read it. Are you happy? Now I must go. I have many things to think about: the press conference, appearance at the Palace CInema... Oh my, I don't know if I can do it all! Then I will come to fetch you for the press conference. And don't do anything silly, OK? If you don't know what to say, don't do anything. It's better you stay silent. Goodbye, my love. - Nano! - Roberto! Where'd you come from? If you only knew what I've been through. Ethiopia, Spain, Albania... Who is she? Don't you remember her? Now she calls herself Alba Doris. What a slut! She made it big because she slept with the Duce. - She's not a slut. - It's just s saying. She's not a slut. - She's a whore! - She really has the face for it! How dare you? You sure look like a jerk! - But you said it. - I can say it. You can't! Helo? What did you say? Roberto? What Roberto? Well, I don't know if she's here. - Miss? - Yes? - It's Roberto. - What Roberto? The one who transported fish on his motorboat. You don't want to talk to him, right? Of course I want to. Roberto? But it can't be true. Is it really you? Where are you? Are you in Venice? Of course I want to see you. No, I can't right now. I have a projection. After that! We can see eachother afterwards! Call me at midnight. Yes... Of course. Bye, Roberto. Goodbye. Oh, Prince! - May I get an autograph? - Sure, sweetie. My God, how beautiful she is! Marcella! - Here, little girl. - Thank you. Marcella! But... Do you know that guy? I've never seen him. Maybe he wants an autograph. Forget it... - You're Roberto Trevisan? - Yes. Roberto Trevisan. - You're Carlo? - Yes, I'm Carlo. My old friend. - May I? - Of course. It's a really nice tuxedo. - Will you offer me a "grappino"? - Sure. Can I lean against you? I have a messed up leg. - Carlo, would you do me a favor? - If I can. - Who has let this bum in? - He's Carlito's friend. This is crazy! Thank you. Why are you clapping, you animals? Why are you applauding? Alba Doris... ...is a great whore - that's coming from a man who knows her well! Bitch! Whore! She's an artist... in fucking! Go hide yourself, you shameless bitch! Go to hell! Duce! Duce! {\i1}On that moment, I wanted to die.{\i} {\i1}But not for the words Roberto screamed out,{\i} {\i1}but because I felt I'd lost him forever.{\i} - Stop! Hold it! - Stop, comrades! Hey, stop! Stop! Kameraden, let us in. - Go away! - Continue on foot! Take it up the ass! - I can't do it anymore, guys. - Here, Francesco. Climb onto me, General. Thank you, son. - Will you be able to do it? - Yes, it's only 8 km to El Alamein. {\i1}On a warm July day Mussolini fell, and I fell with him.{\i} {\i1}Overnight, 40 million Italians realized with pride,{\i} {\i1}that they had always been antifascists.{\i} {\i1}Some of them even came to destroy my house. I was very much compromised.{\i} {\i1}They took everything from the tables to toilet paper.{\i} {\i1}The only one who took pity on me was the cook. {\i} {\i1}He took my Rolls Royce, but left his Toppolino.{\i} {\i1}And one day in late August, I went north. {\i} {\i1}The war continued, {\i} {\i1}and many Italians once again became fascists.{\i} {\i1}Who knows why at sad times, one wants to return to the land of his birth.{\i} {\i1}There were no news of Roberto.{\i} {\i1}But perhaps in Venice I could find someone{\i} {\i1}who could tell me if he was alive or dead.{\i} - Do you need help? - Sure, thank you! I don't know why, but it won't go... - Do you have gas? - Of course. - Can I try? - Yes, thank you. - Bravo! - You see? - Bravo. - You see how it goes? - Thank you, thank you... - It works, it works. Damn pig! Son of a bitch! What happened, ma'am? I got carjacked. In these times we must be very attentive. With one hand in front and one behind. Yeah. If you come with me, I'll drive you wherever you want. - Well... - Huh? - Thanks, I accept. - Climb in. - Is the bike yours? - No. It belongs to the guy who helped me... Don't worry. I'll carry it in. - I'm going to Ferrara. Is that okay? - I go a little further, but that's great too. - My name is Adeline. What about you? - Marcella. - Shall we be on a first name basis? - As you wish. - Don't get frisky, Okay? - You're not offended, are you? If you touch my hump, it brings good luck. What do you do for a living? I trade. I make the journey between Rome and Ferrara. - Look at these. - What are they? Teeth. Gold teeth. I take them from the dead, because they don't serve them anymore. Look, there are 12. When I have 20, I will make a necklace for my wife. - So, you're married? - Yes, that's her. - Pretty woman. - No, she's ugly. She's ugly and she has a hump. You can't have everything in life. But I love her. I love her very much. But what's wrong? You're crying because you think about her? No. I cry because I'm thinking about me. I wanted to be tall, blond, cavalry officer, but instead I'm a hunchback. They don't even want me in war. They don't want me! They said: "Who is not good for the king, isn't good for the queen either. " But bring me the queen here into the truck, and I will take care of her ass! Help! Stop! Stop, please! I beg of you! Come save me! These bloody bombs have destroyed my house. Come, good man! Come on, hurry! Thank you, thank you! Grandma, what happened? There has been a bombing, and they destroyed my ladder. I can't get down. Oh, you poor woman! Okay, I'll help you. Do you have a mattress? - Yes, sir. - Throw it down, so when you jump you won't get hurt. - Throw it! Throw it here! - Here you go. - Good. You have a single bed? - I have another one, but it's heavy. - Okay... - Hey! Hey, good man, where are you going with that? - You're carrying a dead man? - No. He was there before, but not anymore. I threw him out and I kept the box. It would have been a sin to get rid of this. There used to be a cadaver in there. You know what's inside now? Surprise! Look at all those things. There's everything in here - ham, salami, mortadella, cheese... Try it! - You are crazy! I'm outta here. - Where are you going? Come here! - Come here, silly! - Let me go! Don't make me swear, by the nails of Christ! Don't make me blaspheme. You know that every time you curse, you get 7 years of purgatory? Come on, walk! I won't violate you. Don't be afraid, I can do without women, because that is a sin. You're afraid... Afraid of what? See if you are still afraid when I give you a taste of this. - Asshole. - You're an asshole! - My God, a bomb! - I wish! It's much worse. We've blown a tyre. I knew that sooner or later one of them was going to blow. Piece of shit! Look, we're in luck. A workshop. Wait here. Victory! Oh, white flour and chicken eggs. What if you're a German spy? - They are for the Germans. - Let me try. Come. Look at these things. All homegrown. Look. - How beautiful! - Between 3 and 5 kg. I give you two and you feed me. No. You give me three and I'll give you some good coffee. It's a deal, Ersilia. - Is this your girl? - Yes, that's my girl. Oh, my, she's grown into a pretty lady! Do you like these kittens? If you give me a kiss, I'll give you one. - Give me a kiss? - Come, Marilena, go home. Are you afraid that I'll violate her? I'm going to see the mechanic. - Hey, I need a tyre for a 501. - I have a great tyre... - But why should I give it to you? - Because I'll pay well. - Today the money is worthless. - I know, I can give you something in return: a Louis XV chair, or a stove, or a chandelier or a coffin. There is something you could give me... The truth is that without the tyre, we're back to square one. The steak is too rare! I can't force you to do it for a tyre... Of course not! So therefore, you couldn't sacrifice yourself for me... ...especially when there are more respectable women out there, doing it for much less. But it's a matter of principle. Otherwise, the thing would be resolved in 5 minutes, don't you think so? And perhaps you'd enjoy it. Of course, it's a matter of principle. So what are you trying to tell me? That I should do it? - No, no. - Ah! God forbid... But if you decide to go, I'm not going to say no. But I'd be sorry. A pretty girl like you... There he is. What do you think? That's him? Not bad... Marilena, a soda. He must have a good package. Well, let's go buy that tyre. It's true... Women have a bank between their legs. - What did you say? - Yours is broken. It closed its doors! You know, the war has a beautiful side. So many things happen to you. You meet many people... For example, this journey with you, I feel as if I'm going on a nice walk in the countrysie. Yes, and you also got laid. You have some room in your truck? Yes and no. Who are you? We have to get to the Santa Brigitta convent. We'll pay you. I think I get it! You're kikes, eh? We are Jews, yes. So what? - Come on, get off. - What? - Get out! - But why? Because I have to make room for these brothers. I can't let the Germans get them. Get out! Listen, brother, you go in the back with the girl. The lady will sit in front. - Thank you. - And what should I do? Where should I go? Go on foot. You said it felt like a walk, right? Then walk! Enter, ma'am. Close the door. You son of a bitch! Italy is beautiful. Italy has great museums. These paintings are for my friend Goehring. Have you visited Pitti Palace recently? No. Not recently. To the health of Italy and to our meeting. - "Prosit". - Chin-Chin. - I'll accompany you to Venice. - Thank you. - You're from Venice? -Very close by. You know who you remind me of? Colombina. You have the same liveliness of the "Commedia dell'arte". You Italians are all artists. I am from Vienna. It is a beautiful city, but it lost the zest for life. Ah, well... What about your carpaccio? Tell me about your carpaccio. Pardon? Attention, many Germans are hiding here. Be quiet and still. I'll get out for a moment. A bothersome visitor. I ask you to spend a moment in this room. Really, I can go since we have already spoken... I would like to continue talking to you much more. - Please, it'll just be a minute. - Okay. - Well, how many? - Three. Father, mother and daughter. - You're sure they're all Jewish? - Yes, yes. I swear. - Besides, just take a look at their faces. - Their faces? Have you seen your face? My face? I'm a Fascist Arian and a friend of the Germans. On other occasions I delivered Jews, even English and American people. In Florence, Modena and Ferrara. - I always do my duty. - I know, I know. Pick it up. Now you can go. It didn't hurt. Disgusting German! {\i1}Kurt, the German colonel, was very friendly.{\i} {\i1}I spent two weeks with him,{\i} {\i1}But when he said he was in love with me{\i} {\i1}and that he wanted to marry me and take me to Germany, I fled.{\i} - When are we leaving? - We'll be here for two hours. - Two hours? Why? - The partisans have broken the track. Two hours! My God! Help me down, please. - Thank you. - Carefully, sister. - My chicken is dead! - Then we'll have something to eat for dinner What would you like, miss? Ersatz coffee, thanks. - Look! Look who we have here! - Franco! -Life is full of surprises. How are you? - Well. - You became a Fascist? - No, we're filming. I'm the star of... the... "The Heroic Squad" A movie that wants to return the pride in our flag, which has fallen into... ...how to say... in the mud. A large re-entry... I hope so... What about you, what are you waiting for? The Venetian cinema will open its doors for you. Cinecitta is finished. True cinematography takes place here. Hurry, Franco. We must go. The wind is picking up here.. Yes, okay, I'm coming. Why are you waiting for your re-entry? What re-entry are you talking about? I have other things on my mind. I'm going home to my parents, if they're still alive. Well... Goodbye, Franccino. You're going? You'll leave after everything that happened among us, after all the love we had? - How much you loved me, Mariella. - Marcella! Marcella, Marcella. I would tell you many things, but I'm afraid I'll miss the train. - Leave it, I'll pay. - Thank you. - How do I look? - Nice. Beautiful, as always. I often thought of you. God, how our lives have passed. When all this is over, we'll find eachother again. I'm sure. - Viva L'Italia. - Viva. Goodbye, Franco. I'm going or I'll stay on land. - Goodbye. - Goodbye... Goodbye, Gabriella! Life is a mystery. A great mystery. Lombardozzi! Lombardozzi! Those bastards! Hey, you! Hands up. - No, you can't think I'm a... - You're a fascist? No, you're mistaken. I'll explain everything, and you'll get a big laugh. I'm not a fascist. I was shooting a scene in a movie with bucolic elements. Moreover, the film is aggressive against fascism, because we all think the same. Don't yield, boys, don't yield! That's our motto. Don't you believe me? It's true, they dub my voice, but my face... ...look at me in profile, okay? - Hey, Gianna. - What is it? - You know this guy? - Here. Look, look. Franco Denza! It looks like him. It really does. What are you doing dressed like that? I was trying to explain that it's all a misunderstanding... - Would you give me your autograph? - Sure. You see, she recognized me... We are all in the same boat. You're Gianno's friend. He's an actor of the regime! And now you have sided with the Republicans, for propaganda. - Not true. - What are you waiting for? Kill him! She's right. Denza is a fascist. Let's kill him without waiting for orders. What do you say, Fulmi? But I've always told antifascist jokes. My friends say you're not Denza. - What? - Let us kill him. But is this a joke? But this lady even recognized me! I'm Denza, the actor. If you really are the great actor you claim to be, show us what you can do. - Yes, sir. - Can you do Shakespeare? Yes, yes! "Friends, friends..." Sorry, mate. Wait a minute. Continue! "Friends, Romans..." It's coming, it's coming. "... Citiz... Citiz..." "Citizens..." That's it. "I came to bury Caesar, not to praise him. " "The evil that men do..." Thank you! "The evil that men do..." Let's get it over with! Against the wall! - Against the wall. - No, give me a little more time, I have it... it's on the tip of my tongue. - To the wall. Only 5 minutes. Be patient! A moment... I know it very well. - Can I call a priest? - No. I kept remembering the words. They're on the tip of... - Turn around. - Yes, sir. - Turn around! - Agreed. - Turn around, you fool! - Wait a minute! I'm not done. I am Franco Denza! And I know the words perfectly. I know them perfectly. Where was I? Long live St... St... Stalin! Fire! Bravo, you got me! Go home, fool. And respect the partisans. They are your brothers. Farewell, comrades! My God... Poor soul, he died of fear. Dad! Marcella, honey! My beautiful Marcella! Mom! - Dad, how are you? - How beautiful you became! - Let me take a good look at you. - I became older. Mom! - Marcella! - Mom! Finally, my daughter! You never wrote to us. Of course I did. Didn't you receive my money? A few pennies. Where did you put the real money? - What money? - Money you earned from films, for crying out loud! You became rich. Right, Marcellina? I have nothing left. They have taken everything. - What? - Well done! What great news! What a career you made for yourself, you bitch! - You could have been a princess, a millionaire. - With all the sacrifices we made! {\i1}I found out that Roberto had been sent to fight voluntarily in Russia.{\i} Marcella. {\i1}I found work as a singer, in a small orchestra.{\i} Don't be afraid. The Americans won't bomb Venice. Thank you. {\i1}A few years later...{\i} Here come my little treasures! Come, my loved ones. Hi, Mom. Go and wash your hands so you can eat. I have to leave soon, my dear. I'll go to Smolensk in Russia for a while to start a chocolate factory sponsored by the Soviet government. I would like to go, too. - Really? - Yes Franz, you know I never kept any secrets from you. I had another fiancee before you. But don't worry, there was nothing between us. His name was Roberto. I was told that he died in Russia. The war... - What a horrible thing. - Yes I want to go with you... ...because I want to bring some flowers to his grave. My dear Marcella... You are so good, sensitive, loyal. {\i1}My heart was racing.{\i} {\i1}Driving through the Russian steppes, I approached the cemetery...{\i} {\i1}...to bid farewell to the man of my life.{\i} {\i1}The only man I truly loved.{\i} {\i1}And if he were alive...{\i} {\i1}...he would certainly run towards me to embrace me,{\i} {\i1}...and forgive me for all the wrong I had done.{\i} - Hey, comrade! - What do you want? Which is the way to the cemetery? - Straight ahead, 3 or 4 Km. - Thank you. Damn it, what strong wind today! Cold as shit! - The table is set, Roberto! - I'm coming. - You made macaroni? - Yes.
