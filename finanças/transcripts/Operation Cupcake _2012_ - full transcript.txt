Right, left. - Sound off. - One, two. - Sound off. - Three, four. - Morning, sir. - Colonel Carson. General. Have a good two-month leave. We'll miss you around here. Appreciate that, sir. I haven't been home that long in years. And who knows, maybe the next time I see you, you'll be General Carson. Anything's possible, sir. - Have a safe trip. - Thank you, sir. I'm gonna go put these outside, wanna come? Yeah, hold on. Dad's coming. When do you think he's gonna get here? We haven't seen him in so long. I hope he likes it. I can't wait. Put one up a little higher. - How's that? - Great. - That's good. - Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Perfect, okay. Okay. There we go! How does it look? - It looks good. - Aah! It looks so good. It's great. Dad's gonna love it. You did such a good job. I hope he likes it. Okay, he just called. He'll be here any minute. Let's go. Hey, I saw that. - Saw what? - Don't eat the cupcake. Fine. Oh, not that cheesy watch thing. - It is not cheesy. - Wait, what watch thing? When dad's gone, mom wears a watch to count the minutes until they're together again. But when they're together, she takes it off because time doesn't matter. That's right. There he is. Oh, my gosh. Hi, honey! - Hey, dad. - Hi, honey. Oh, my gosh. Honey. - I love you. - I love you too. Missed you. Feels so good. - Oh, my gosh. - Hi! Look at you. I missed you. Hello, Colonel. How are you, young man? Oh, no! It's okay, babe. - It's all right. - That's okay, I got it. It's all right. That's all right, I'll just make another one. Okay. It's so great to be home. I really missed this. The food or us? Would I be a jerk if I said both? No. I noticed, my car wasn't in the driveway. - Right. - Any reason for that? - I didn't crash it. - It's in the shop. But nobody got hurt, and I'm paying for the damage. What happened? We were having a driving lesson. She was staring at her boyfriend and crashed into the mailbox. Boyfriend? What boyfriend? - You are such a narc. - Poser! You guys, stop fighting. Your dad just got home. - Hey, those look fantastic. - Thanks. Did you tell him about the new store? - You found a place? - Yes, yesterday. I was gonna tell you about it in person. But there's this bakery across town that backed out of their lease and the place was halfway done, - so it was perfect. - That was fast. I can't believe how this has taken off. I don't know how I'm gonna manage two stores all at once. But at least I have Sheila, and once it's up and running, it's gonna be... I don't wanna talk about this. You're here for a week. I don't wanna talk about business. - Actually, we don't have a week. - What? It's only a weekend pass? But you're up for a promotion. And I've decided to take a furlough... Until the review board announces its decision. I'm here for two months. What? Two months? Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy. Maybe forever. Forever? If I make General, that could mean another four-year stint overseas, another four years of being a part-time husband and a part-time father. I've missed so much of your lives already. Are you saying that you're considering retirement? I'm saying we have a decision to make. Yeah, hi, Thad. Yes. Yeah, I know we have to sign the papers. Thad, I just woke up. I'll call you later, okay? Sorry. Why is he calling so early? Are you, like, his only client? No, he's just enthusiastic. He's the one who put this whole deal together. I never liked that guy. He had a weak handshake. Do you remember when you did a one-handed push-up over our wedding cake? How could I forget the glory days? You still owe me a real wedding, you know. That was a real wedding, honey. I don't know. It was on a military base with a chaplain. We've lasted 18 years. He must've said something right. Aw. Driving lesson. Wake up. You're joking, right? It's the perfect time. There's no cars on the road. Mom's teaching me. Your mother is busy. I, on the other hand, have nothing but time. And who is this boy you're going out with? We're not going out. But you're planning to? - I guess. - When? Do we really have to do this now? - Absolutely. - Mom? Might as well get it over with. Next weekend. And to your next questions, he has a 3.4 gpa, no tattoos, no piercings. - You left out age. - 35. But he spent 10 years in prison, so he looks a lot younger. He's 18. 18? Yeah, I met his mom. She's really nice. You're talking to his mother now? Of course I am. Are we almost done? Hey, we just started. That looks like poison oak. No, don't worry about that. Here we go. Honey. Honey, honey, honey, honey. Sorry. Can you just move... - Honey. - Sorry. Go ahead. No, no, go ahead. This isn't working... - Standing by. - Oh, boy. Still standing by. - Careful, careful, honey. - Sorry, sorry. I got a blade in my hand. I just don't wanna be late. Okay, all right, love you. Love you. I left you a to-do list, okay? Bye. - How are you? - I'm good. Tell me that's not what you're wearing to school. - Mom left already? - Yup. Then I guess this isn't what I'm wearing to school. Does she always dress like that? Yes. You must be starving after that workout, huh? Get your head up. Actually, I feel like throwing up. Here we go. Look at that. Eat up. That was fast. Do I pass inspection? Yeah. Have some breakfast. Thanks, but I only eat fruit before noon. Coming Ollie? Yeah. Love you, dad. Have a good day, guys. Guess I'll be needing reading glasses. Whoa! You breaking into this house? - I live here. - Most people use the door. - I lost my key. - What's your name? Ray. Ray McKewen. Why aren't you in school, McKewen? I came home early. I had a toothache. A toothache? Show me some I.D. What are you doing to my son? Let him go. I'm sorry, ma'am. I... I'm a neighbor. I just thought... Get out of here before I call the cops! Okay. Carry on. Are you okay? Yeah. That was awesome. It was not awesome. Hi, can I get a strawberry cupcake and a coffee to go, please? - I'll be right there. - Great. - I need a latte. - Yeah. Double frosting coming right up. - Thanks, Janet. - The usual. Is Griff back yet? He actually came back last night, yes. There he is right now. Hi. Hey, welcome home. Good to see you. Welcome back. Hey, thanks for your service. There you go. Hi, hon. Hi. Hey, welcome back. Well, thank you, Sheila. You're looking great. I'm 15 pounds overweight and wearing far too much pink. - You want to try that again? - How's your parakeet? Cockatoo. I had to get rid of him. We didn't get along. Well, then, it's great seeing you, as always. You too. And before I forget, we were all so relieved to find out that nasty rash of yours had cleared up. Janet, I'm going to go watch Ollie practice. - Okay. - So, honey, what time do you want me to come back and pick you up? Don't worry about that. Thad will drop me off. We have a meeting later tonight. - Great. - What can I get for you? Can I get one of those, please? Okay. All right, son. Grab your mitt. Head on out to the field. Who's my next batter? Come on, Ollie. Ollie, you're up. - Let's go, son. - Yeah. Hustle up. Let's go, Ollie! Come on, Ollie. You can do it, buddy. Let's go, buddy, let's go! Let's go, Ollie. Stand right in there. Stand right in there. - Weight on your back... - spread your legs wider. Sorry, coach. When he winds up, cock your elbow. Be ready to swing. Nice try, Ollie. Ollie, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Dad, please. All right. Step closer to the plate. - Get aggressive, Ollie! - Don't dip your shoulder. Step right through there, buddy! Here we go, Ollie. Come on. You got it, Ol. Ollie, swing, bud! That's a strike! Swing right through. Get aggressive, buddy. - Okay, you swung a little late. - Step... step straight forward. - Keep your eye on the ball. - Ollie, step forward. You're gonna have to decide quickly. Forward, straight. Line them up like I showed you. Strong stance, buddy. Strong stance. Sorry, coach. Coach, you do your thing. Come on, bud. Here we go, batter. Let's go. Nice try, Ollie. You swing at it when they're that high. All right, next batter. - Hi, honey. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. Welcome back, sergeant. Thanks. And it's Colonel. We signed the lease. We open in 30 days. - Hey, congratulations. - Thank you, thank you. Did she tell about the big order we pulled in? Sweet 16 for the mayor's daughter. - I mean, killer PR. - Yeah. But if we play this right, our Janet here is gonna be the new Mrs. Fields. And you can be, Mr. Fields. Or I guess you'd be Colonel fields, right? - Yeah. Yeah. - Right. Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Janet. Thanks, Thad. - Colonel. - Thad. Thad. What... what's going on? I never noticed it before. I can't believe it. This place is like a home invasion waiting to happen. I'm gonna put in a security system. You mean, like, lights and stuff? Yeah, and some other things. Okay. Honey, I had another idea. Do you think the house needs to get painted? No. I think its fine. Well, because the backyard was looking... look, I know you're not used to not having anything to do. I've got plenty to do. Why does that scare me? You know it takes some adjusting when you're home on leave. What if this isn't just leave? Well, when you get the promotion, we'll figure it out. And if I don't get it? You'll get used to it, I promise. I love you so much. I love you too, hon. You may go. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? I'm good. Sorry I'm a little late. That's all right. - Ready? - Yup. Okay. So what are you guys gonna do? - Watch TV. - Okay. I don't have any homework, so... That's awesome. I can't see. Let's see. - That's cool. - That's dad. What is... you have 15 seconds to enter the code - before the alarm goes off. - What, are we under attack? We could be. - 12 seconds. - What's the code? Your birthday, the day, and then the month. And enter. Try it again. No, wait, wait. Clearly, you forgot my birthday. No. I got it. Please, stop this. Yeah, yeah. Hold on. Hold on. One second. Hold on. One second, one second. Griff! - Where is he? - I don't know. Griff? I must have, uh... must have got some wires crossed. Stop that. - What's the matter with you? - Poison oak. The nurse said it's from the woods. Come on. Let's go watch TV. You guys go. Get in here. Ooh. I can't do this. What? I can't retire. I don't know how to be a civilian. You know, why don't you come work at the store? What? Just until I get the other one up and running. I could really use the help, and it would get you out of the house. Is that fear in your eyes, Colonel? Affirmative. You're good at giving orders. Now you can take them. For cupcakes. We rotate 32 varieties, and daily specials are up front. We got chocolate sundae, black raspberry. I'm a fan of banana. Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm... I'm not wearing these. Okay, well, you're gonna wear this. - Honey, are you kidding me? - What? Well, this looks ridiculous. Oh, honey, it's part of the outfit. You gotta wear it. - Sweetheart... - it gets worse. No, no. No way. It's health code reg. Only when you're baking or icing, okay? It's okay. You look cute. I like to do the icing with a knife, but it's a lot easier to use the frosting gun. A gun? Okay. So you just go right here. Just swirl it around like that. Are you paying attention? - Roger that. - You can do that. Honey, does she need to be here? Yes, just don't engage. And if she engages first? Surrender. Here, you try. Okay. Fold those in. This goes over. That goes over. Then you gotta put these flaps in here. And they can be a little tricky, okay? Any questions? Just one. Does everything have to be so pink? You're embarrassed. That's cute. Not helping. You know what, maybe I should just stay. Sweetheart, no. You go ahead. You go on your meeting. I'll be fine. Don't worry. I'll keep a short leash on him. Let's just go over this one more time, here. Honey, honey, we've gone over everything three times already. I've got it. I run a battalion of over a thousand men. I can handle some cupcakes. Okay. I love you. I love you too. The place is in good hands. Bye. I realize how fascinating this must be for you, but if you're back here, you need the net. Okay. Just an observation, but you could double your output if you use both racks. I could. And, if this was a mess hall, I would. But they cook better with one rack. How much better could they taste? It's just flour and water. Flour and water? And what, the Mona Lisa is just paint on a canvas? Technically, yes. Are you telling me how to bake? Because I've been doing this for 27 years. You've been here 27 minutes. You're in my world now. I'm just trying to make this operation a little more efficient. Okay. You see this? That is your line in the sand. You stay on that side, and we won't have any problems. You got a customer. Carson, I heard you were back. Hey, Harley, how you doing? How are you, man? Yeah, that's a nice color on you. Oh, yeah. How'd you get roped into this? I got drafted, or I enlisted. I don't know. I haven't seen you since the Fort Benning days. Yeah. You're looking good, brother. Thank you. You too. You know, I've been out seven years now. I got the hardware store over on pine. Hey, that's great. It is now. At first, though, I don't know, I felt like a stranger in my own life. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - It gets easier. So you finally decided to retire? Well, still deciding. Actually, I'm up for General. General? Congrats, sir. Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen a General in a hairnet. Can I get you something? Yeah. How about an apple crisp and a coffee? Coming right up. So, dad, I heard you had to wear an apron. And a hairnet. Harsh. Hey, you want to know what's really harsh? - What? - No, no, no, no, no. The boss wouldn't trust me to be alone with the cakes. It was your first day. I'll trust you tomorrow. Here, look. Here. Kim, dinner. Right? That's classified. Delete that. Well, she'll just take another one tomorrow. And by her, you mean Sheila? I'm afraid she sent a mass email. That woman has a personality problem. Well, you'll get used to her. Do I have to? For tomorrow night. What do you think? You look really pretty, honey. What's tomorrow night? I'm going out. I told you. 3.4 gpa, no tattoos, no earrings? 11:00 p.m. curfew, group date only, and I want to meet him. You said when I was 16 I could go out alone. I meant 17. That's not fair. Mom? Yup. Yeah, we said 16. I just didn't think it would get here that quick. Ollie, come on. Get up. Remember when you were little, we used to run the obstacle course on base? - I did? - Yeah. Three days a week, rain or shine. How come we stopped living on base? Well, I got transferred to Germany. Your mother and I decided we didn't want to uproot you guys anymore. - Why? - Well, you had friends, you had school. We wanted you guys to have as normal an upbringing as possible. Normal's overrated. And growing up an army brat can be tough. I should know. It's just that I wish you'd been around more. Me too, buddy. I've been waiting for ten minutes. The usual, please! - Come on. - Let's go. Where's Janet? It's just me today. She left you alone on Friday rush? It's a cupcake store. I think I can handle it. Okay. Good morning, ladies. - That must be the husband. - Where's his apron? Good morning. What can I get you ladies? Two decaf, two angel food. Two decaf, two angel. Janet gives us the decaf for free. Okay. Janet brings our order to the table. Of course. Apparently, nickels aren't good enough for him. All right, here, come on. - And take some more... - hurry up. Open your purse. Yeah, all right. It's open. All right, all right, all right. Open it harder. I can't get every... I can't get the sweetener in there. I'm doing the best I can. Don't make me nervous, please. I'm not trying to make you nervous. - I just wanna... - Just fill up the thing. Your husband needs this. Well, my husband needs a lot of things. - What is he doing? - Well, I don't know. He looks so out of his element. This is a fish-out-of-water comedy. He can't even read. What is going on? Why doesn't he use those... I don't believe it. He should not be wearing those glasses. Those are hideous. - He's a fashion disaster. - He is. Okay, ladies. Two coffees, and two angel foods. This is not decaf. I'm sure it is decaf, ma'am. We'll have hot water with lemon. Of course. - I hope these are better. - What's going on with Janet? I swear, I don't know what she... this is ridiculous. - Can I get a little help here? - Right there. Excuse me. Hi. Can I have two hot flan? - Whoa. - I was first. Chocolate mousse. Hello? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who was first? Excuse me. Can I get two hot flan, please? - Whoa, excuse me. - I was first. - Chocolate mousse. - Wait. Wait, wait, wait. - Wait one second. - Are you serious? I don't wanna argue with you, ladies. That does not mean anything. Listen, I was here first. I have to go to work. No, no, it does mean something. It does not mean anything. Because I come here all the time. This is Carson, sir. I just wanted to give you a heads up. The promotions board is reviewing your file this week. That's excellent, sir. Everything all right over there? Yeah, yes, sir. Sorry, sir. I'm just helping out the wife at her shop, sir. Get back to it. I'll be in touch. Thank you, sir. Okay. So who had the hot flashes? - That's you, right? - Hot fl... excuse me? And you're the mousse? - What did you call me? - Out of line. - What? - Look, you know what? I'm... no, you didn't. I'm not coming back. I'm done. No. What? What? No, ma'am, no, I didn't, I didn't... hello? Hello? Hi, coffee, please. To go. Yes, ma'am, absolutely. Okay, no. No hot water. Excuse me. I was first. Chocolate mousse. Wait a second. No. No, you were not first. Two waters with lemon. Come on. Right away. I'm so sorry. One second. Sheila, could I get a hand out here, please? I've been waiting forever. - Are you totally inept? - Excuse me? Just fill the order, you loser. All right, that's it. Then get Phil on the phone. A dozen buttermilk to go. Yes, of course. Buttermilk. You got it. - The coffee, please. First. - Yes, ma'am. - To go. - To go? Yeah, of course. Not to go for you, but, yes, to go for you. Right, I got it. And two waters with... the hot water with lemon. Do you remember that finally? Thank you. Okay. One moment. One second. Be right with you. I'm so sorry. I want my flan. Hi, honey. Sorry. So, dad, mom gave you the old ax? No. Your dad and I decided that it would be best if his time was spent elsewhere. Dad, this is Ray. Good to meet you. I mean, under normal circumstances, mister... Colonel, sir. Wait, when did you two meet? So you're interested in my daughter? Dad, please. I think she's the bomb, sir. I work with bombs, Ray. They explode. Poor choice of words. What I meant was I think she's a very nice girl, sir. She used to wear pink. Now she wears black. You have anything to do with that, Ray? - No, I don't think so. - Dad. We're just going to the movies. - What movie? - A vampire movie. Nc-17? She's 16. No. It's a... it's pg. It's g. I assume you have a valid driver's license. Yeah. Proof of insurance? It's in the car. Ha-ho, is that the vehicle you plan on driving my daughter around in, Ray? - Well, I... - yes or no? I'm sorry, Kim. I just remembered that I have this thing that I have to... okay. You just ruined my life. I was just asking him some questions, honey. I mean, if that's gonna break him down... Nick and his dad are taking me to the batting cages. You're not coming, right? Right. Got it. Love you. Love you too. - That went well. - Yeah, you were the bomb. Honey? You think we made a mistake? Hundreds. I can't help thinking if I didn't take that commission to Germany... I'd be one of you now. I wouldn't have to catch up or fight my way back in. You are one of us. Everything's changed so much. The kids, they're not kids anymore. And you're... you're doing so well without me. We're doing so much better with you. Janet. Janet, you there? Hello? Look, I heard about the disaster in the bakery today. It was a bad day. That's all. I disagree. I mean, what he does in that store affects the new store. Hi, how are you? - How are you? - Hi. What are you doing? Honey, yesterday wasn't pretty. I know that. I lost focus, but right now I am in the zone. I've been up all night running through a list of things to tighten up operations. Pink boxes assembled in advance. Result, more one-on-one time to serve the cupcakers' needs. Please. All items relabeled much bigger, much easier to read. Minimizes indecision. Instead of a free-for-all at the counter, we encourage a single-file orderly line-up. Increased turnover, increased sales. Look, honey, I know I wasn't up for this job to begin with. I underestimated it. But I can do this. You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. Pink may not be my color of choice, but I am no quitter. Excuse me? May I help you? Hi. Yes. I'd like two of these, please. Great choice. Fantastic. - And you, sir? - You know what? I'm just gonna need a couple things to go. - Absolutely. - He's back? He's back. Thank you very much. Come again. Thank you. All right, babe. - Honey? - Yes? That enemy bakery is stealing all your morning customers. They're not the enemy, and they're not my customers. Well, they could be. Uh, no. My customers start at 11:00 a.m. Whatever you're thinking, don't. It doesn't make sense. - Him again. - Hey. Colonel, I didn't expect to see you back here. It's funny. I expect to see you wherever I turn. Griff's running the store. Well, I'm sure you guys have thought this out. - Yes. We have. - Yeah. Janet, we really ought to hit it if we're gonna meet the contractors. Yes. Okay. All right. Bye. I love you. Love you. Thank you. Hey, what's up, man? I heard someone's coffee cup calling for a little more coffee, am I right? - There we go. - Yes, please. There we go. Enjoy, ladies. - Thanks. - Thank you. You can't finish that, hmm? Can I help you? No. Like a little coffee? No, I'm fine. Thanks. A little more decaf, ladies? Half a cup. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. You're learning. So you're gonna give me the brisket recipe? I'll give it to you, but you just look it up. It's in the joy of cooking. It's from a book? Well, why not? It's a cookbook. Please, I thought your mother gave it to you. What an adorable little one. - Thank you. - What can I do for you today? Well, Ashley Ann is turning one, and we need 100 cupcakes to match this color swatch. So what do you suggest? Well, our display case is right here. Why don't you take a look at the display case while I figure this one out? All right, sounds good. Thank you. I think you should go with ballerina. - Not Pink Lady? - Nah. Pink Lady's got a bluish undertone to it. Well, if anything I was thinking it leans more toward magenta. - Magenta? - Yes, I do. Look... look at us. What are we doing? We used to talk about troop deployments. - Now... - Ashley Ann likes Pink Lady. Can you have those ready by tomorrow morning? - Absolutely. - Great, thank you. Thank you. We'll see you in the morning. We'll see you then. I think they're doing more than redecorating. I can't have those ready by tomorrow. You can if you use both racks. You know my rack policy. Change it. Don't let Sheila catch you. Never. That is funny. How about you? What's going on in the lady department? - Stop. - What? Come on. - You're mean. - I'm not mean. Yeah, Jim, it's Carson. I need a background check on a civilian, asap. Hello, everyone. Thank you. Hey, honey! Hi, sweetheart. How are you doing? The place looks great. Thanks. We think so. Why don't I take everybody out for a little family dinner? We just ate. Thad brought us some Thai food. Yeah. I'm sorry, honey. The kids were starving. No problem at all. There's leftover mee krob if you wanna pick through it. How thoughtful. You know what? This is the electrician. I'll be right back. All right. Yeah. Janet tells me you had a decent day at the store. Yeah, yeah, we moved some cakes. You know, I have to admit I wasn't really all that thrilled about you going back in there. But I get that you're trying to be useful while you're home, so it's good for you. Yeah. Well, that means... A lot. You know what, if there's anything I can do for Janet, you know, or the family, I'm there. Well, I appreciate that. You know what, actually, there is one little thing. Done. Name it. Well, it concerns your Toyota out there. Mercedes. Right, because I was teaching Kim how to drive, and that seems much more maneuverable than the minivan, so that would be just fantastic. Thank you very much. Just a quick spin, no problem at all. Come on, hon. - Thank you so much, Thad. - Yeah, sure. Appreciate that. Honey, what do you see when you go to the mall? Clothes stores? Do you want to know what I see? I see shoplifters. I see pickpockets. I see an overcrowded escalator. I see an unchecked flame at the chicken joint. Okay? You have to constantly be reassessing the threat level. That's how you become a defensive driver. - Okay. - Okay. Now... This really is nice, isn't it? - Yeah. - Okay. Now, what you do is you take that key thingy... You stick it inside that little slot, right? Now put it into drive. - Put your blinker on. - I did, I did, I did. Okay. Now, calmly go ten and two. You pull out nice and easy. There you go, honey. What are you doing? Are you gonna come to bed? Yeah, honey, I'll be right there. Okay. Maple bacon cupcakes are our new morning cupcakes. We are now open every single morning at 7:00 a.m. Come on inside. If you like those, we got plenty more inside. Absolutely, here you are. Free cup of coffee with every single cupcake purchased. Thank you, sir. There you are, ma'am. Here, sir. Maple bacon, one of our many, many flavors. Thank you very much. There you are. We're open every morning from 7:00 a.m. Thank you, sir. You're starting a war, you know. Sheila, why don't you go inside and have a latte? I'm lactose intolerant. Or maybe just intolerant. I heard that. Here, try our maple bacon cupcakes. We're open every single morning. Thank you. And here we are. Half a dozen I'm a fan of bananas. Thank you very much. Next, please. I know. Honestly, she's so delusional if she thinks she's going over the exact same... no talking on the cell phone, please. I'm just going to revoke her invitation. I know. I know. That's what I told her... excuse me. But that's not happening. Yeah, I know, right? - Yeah, unless you were... - Ladies, I'm gonna have to ask you to empty out your purses, please. I beg your pardon? The bags. Open them up. What are you suggesting? I'm suggesting that you're stealing all of my sugar. I mean, how much sugar can one person really need? How dare you? I don't like your tone. Please open the bags. - Certainly not. - No. We're on a fixed income. You don't pay anything for this stuff. - Please open them up. - I'm not gonna take anymore. - We're out of here. - Let's go. Bye. - Like she says. - This is last time I'm ever coming in here. Absolutely. Never again. Excuse me. Yeah. That's like... no cell phones, please. Buying the exact same dress. I know. That's what I told her, and I told my mom... - Excuse me. - Yeah. - Excuse me. - Yeah, totally. That sign back there. - One second. - No talking on the cell phone. Sorry. Excuse me, but my father's the mayor. - Your father's the mayor? - That's right. My father fought the Viet Cong for six years. His father went M.I.A. In World War II. They sacrificed for your right to talk on the phone, just not in this store. I have no idea what you just said, but my sweet 16 order, cancel it. Okay, you have no idea how crazy this guy is. Canceled. Phone talker. Janet is going to kill you. The sign was clearly posted. "No cell phones". That was our biggest order, not to mention the publicity. Collateral damage. It's not collateral. It's just damage. I'll call the mayor's office tomorrow. No, you won't. You're gonna stand behind the counter and take orders. Yes, ma'am. There you go. Thank you very much. Hey, dad. Hey, Ollie. Hey, can you donate 100 cupcakes? Not now, buddy. I'm a little bit busy, okay? But it's for my baseball fundraiser. I understand, okay? Why don't you go in the back and do some homework? We'll talk about it later. - Fine. - Come on, go, go, go, buddy. Okay. Who's next? What can I do for you? You can give me my morning customers back. It's called the spirit of competition. On the house. You want competition? Fine. I'm gonna go after the mayor's daughter's sweet 16. Bring it on. Oh, it is on! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? We're in combat mode, Sheila. Change of strategy. Take that pan out of there. We need more supply. We are gonna bake that guy right off the block. Take that pan out of there, and you get back to your designated area. Or what? I quit. Who's next? Hey, man. Everything all right? Grab an apron. Move, soldier. Grab an apron! Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yes. I know. I saw the lease agreement. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I have it. You know, I gotta call you back. Ooh. And how can I help you today? Can I get three pink ladies, two crazy key limes, and... excuse me for one second. - Sorry? - Ollie, honey? - Yeah. - Is that your backpack in the corner over there? No. Mine's right here. And I'd like... one moment, sorry. Kim! Kim, sweetheart, that your backpack over there in the corner? - Mm-mm. - Yours? Excuse me, everyone. I'm sorry. Does this backpack belong to anybody here? - Not mine. - No. It's not. No. Sorry. Okay, folks, we have a situation here. I want everybody to stay calm. Honey, don't. - Why? - Possible I.E.D. - O.M.G. - Okay, everybody. Calmly, calmly, please exit the premises, please. Okay, move, move, move, move, move. No, wait. No, no, no, no, no. There's a... What's going on? Oh, my god. Fortunately, it's just water damage. But it'll be a few weeks before they can start repairs. A few weeks? Our vendors are backed up. I'm sorry. We'll be in touch. Go wait in the car. You are like a weapon of mass destruction. I can fix it. Really? Can you fix that? That I can explain. I could care less about this store, and I could care less about cupcakes, but you not trusting me... Honey, I trust you. It's him I don't trust. Thad. This guy is trying to tear us apart. Oh, no, I think you're doing a really good job of that yourself. For years, I have dreamt about you being back home and us being happy. But you know what? I think... I sometimes think that the reason why we're still together is because you're never here. Honey, don't even say that. I think that it would be best if you slept somewhere else tonight. Just tonight? No. Your car is fixed. - Hey. - Hey, buddy. Thanks for letting me crash here tonight. Hey, no problem. All right. You sure your wife doesn't mind? Considering she's in Cleveland, I think it's fine. She's away? Going on six years now. Sorry. I didn't know that. I was gonna mention it to you, but I didn't want to discourage you. Well, I'm officially discouraged. I really screwed up today. Hey, man, no cutting. Get in the back of the line. I know. I owe you an apology. Nah, no apology necessary. Thank you. That's very understanding. Are you kidding? It's the best thing that ever happened to me. Since then, I've got my morning business back, plus yours, not to mention the mayor's daughter's sweet 16. Well, congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. And I'll take a cupcake. - Thanks. - That'll be five bucks. Five bucks? All in the spirit of competition. Sure. There you go. Thank you. Would you like a little more coffee? Hey. Hey, thank you so much for doing this. - No problem. - Appreciate it. Janet. I still can't believe that you let him back in there. Well, he's got help. Harley owns the hardware store. Great. Free access to power tools. They're trying to help. Look, it's better than waiting three weeks to reopen, you know. I guess. Anyway, good news. What? Channel 8 called back. They want to do a piece on you. Are you kidding? No. - Isn't that great? - That's awesome! Thank you. - You're welcome. - Yes. - My pleasure. - Yes. Yes. Yes. Ollie, what are you doing here? It's Wednesday. Faster, dad. All right, Ollie. Hold on. - Yeah? - Slow down, buddy. Okay. Ooh-Kay. I'm tired. You're getting in shape, buddy. Thanks. It's all because of your routines. You're going back, aren't you? When your mom lets me. I mean, back to the base. You're not retiring, are you? Well, nothing's been decided yet. I know I messed up really badly, but I'll do my very best to make things better, okay? And then you'll leave? - That's cool. - Right? 'Cause then they all kind of need the food basically? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What are you doing here? I'm here with Ray. You like this bakery, Ray? No, sir. I never come here. - But you're here now. - I just needed bread. - The market sells bread. - It's day-old bread. You're feeding my daughter day-old bread, Ray? It's for the halfway house. You an addict? I volunteer there, sir. Well, then, in that case, why don't you get them some fresh bread? Thank you, Mr. Carson... Colonel, sir. Thanks, dad. We're not finished yet. Yeah, I can see that. I know it doesn't look like it, but Harley says that you can reopen this weekend. And if you need anybody to help, you know, fill in until you can find a replacement for Sheila, I'd be happy to help. Thanks, but I don't think so. Of course. What? I was just thinking that... you want us to stop? Pine. Pine? Yeah, I never really liked these old Formica countertops and... Do you think you guys could put in pine? Yeah. Sure. Thanks. So have you heard anything from the review board? No, no, not yet. You look... you look really great. Thanks. I ran into Kim and the arm, you know, what's his name? Ray. They seem like they're getting pretty serious. No more than us at that age. Yeah, but we were more responsible, right? Probably not. Well, 'cause it really seemed like we were. Yeah. I got to go, so... Janet, how did you get the idea for four star bakery? Well, my husband's in the military, and my kids are in school. And I just felt like I was always waiting for the ones that I loved to come home. So I felt like I needed to create a new role for myself. Cupcakes are so hot right now. Why do you think that is? Well... yes. - Here's my cupcakes. - Hi. Someone once told me that you can't look at a cupcake without smiling, so... Well, I know that I'm smiling. - Aw. - And that's the news. Thanks, Kayla. Those really look good. Now... Come on. Looking good. - Come on, guys. - Watch out for the squeeze. Watch out for the squeeze play, guys. - All right. - That's okay. That's all right. We'll get two. We'll get two next time. Come on, man. - Let's go, dragons. - That's it. Hey, I didn't know you had a kid on the dragons. I don't. He's on the other team. Strike one. - We're in first place. - Nice. That's okay, you know what the strike looks like now. So cupcakes, huh? That's right. You got it. You got it. Sheila's? Mine. Sheila won't make cupcakes for me. Listen, I'm going to be reopening next week at 11:00 a.m. I thought maybe we could go back to our original agreement. You can open whenever you want, but I'm going to continue to make my cupcakes. As your husband says, it's in the spirit of competition. Right. - Mind if I squeeze in here? - Oh, please do. - That's okay. - These look amazing. Oh, well, thank you. You know what they say, you can't even look at a cupcake without smiling. You saw that? Yes, I did. It was great. - So who made these? - I did. Really, who made them? Me. I was up most of the night baking. I can't believe you made these. I can never get the camouflage right. Well, camouflage is kind of a guy thing. Although I wouldn't really know that any more. You know, he asked her to the prom. - Fantastic. - He's a good kid. I know. It's just she's our little girl. Yeah, I know. I have a hard time too. - Really? - Yeah. And she's going to be off to college soon. And then Ollie and... I think that's why my business is so important, because you're all going to be gone, and I'm just going to disappear, you know. Why would you ever think that? Because I'm a 40-year-old mom and wife, and where am I going to be in ten years? 50. No, I'm going to be alone, Griff. You're going to be General, and they'll be gone. It's the bottom of the ninth, and the tigers and dragons are tied, one to one. Next up for the dragons, number 11, Oliver Carson. - Come on! - Yeah! Whoo! Let's go, Ollie. Come on, buddy. - Go, Ollie. - Let's go, Ollie. Go, Ollie! Come on, Ollie. Come on! You got it, bud. Ooh, this is big. Strike one. It's all right. Let's go, buddy. Strike two. It's okay, Ollie. It's okay, buddy. Here we go, bud. Let's go, Ollie, let's go! Let's go, Ollie, let's go! Come on, buddy, come on now. Come on. Come on, let's go, dragons. - Yes! - Go, go, go, go, go! Safe. And the dragons win, two to one, on Oliver Carson's one-run homer. Way to go. That was awesome. No way. - So good. - Oh, ho! Let's have a big round of applause for our division two tigers. Great job, fellas. Great season. - That was amazing. - Fantastic. He just... he leapt right over the guy. Hi. Honey, I don't know if I've ever actually ever said this to you out loud, but I'm really proud of you. Thank you. Come here. Are you kidding me? That was incredible. That was fantastic, buddy! All that hard work paid off! You just... vroom. Hey, we should all celebrate, okay? We should go over and get some burgers at angel's. That's still the place, right? Angel's is no longer in business. And the team's taking me to pizza. But thanks for the offer. - Yeah. - Bye, guys. Love you. And I got to meet Thad at the new store. I'm sorry. No. No worries. We'll do it another time. Yeah. Okay. So you got turned down by everybody else? Where's Ray and his arm? He's resting his arm up for our date later. He's gonna be resting it in a cast if he's not careful. - Look at that. - That's great. That's nice. Harley, thank you so much. You're welcome, man. We did it. The place looks fantastic. Hey, listen, I'm going to take off. Are you coming over tonight? Yeah. Yeah. I'll be there. I just want to make this place perfect. I have a few little finishing touches. You go for it, man. I'll see you later. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Make this quick. Fine. His cupcakes suck. You know it, I know it. What's your point? I know you don't like me, but this is not about me. This is about Janet. Just tell me what it would take to get you to come back. You buy me a new icing gun. Done. And you apologize. On your knees. That last one might be a bit of a problem. You want me to come back? Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I'm waiting. Sheila, I apologize for anything that I have ever said or done that offended you. I am very sorry, I apologize, and will you please come back? All right. All right. All right. I don't suppose there's any chance that you might erase that? Not a chance. And, for the record, I don't dislike you any more than I dislike anybody else. 18th to... yeah. - Hi. - Hi. We should celebrate. You know? There you go. To... New beginnings. What's wrong? Come on, we worked hard for this. I just never thought I'd celebrate anything without Griff. Well, he's got himself to blame. Just never made any room for him. I just expected him to fit into our lives, and I've been so busy building all of this apart from him. Well, you've grown, and he hasn't. You know, I hate to be the one to say this, but what do you guys have in common anymore? Whoa! What are you doing? You have to know how attracted I am to you. I mean, what do you think we're doing here? Working. Come on. You don't have to feel guilty. No. Hello? Are you awake? I was just about to call you. I was wondering if you wanted to come with me to Harley's party tomorrow. Welcome to the Oaks. Thanks. Thank you very much. You did all this? Well, you know, Harley's been a good friend. And this is kind of a big deal for him. He brought somebody. Yeah. Hey, there's Harley. Harley, happy birthday, buddy. Hey, Carson. All right. Take it easy. Hi, Harley. Happy birthday. Janet. Thank you. You look beautiful. - Thank you. - Hey, listen, listen, listen. I got to... I got to... I got to introduce you to my gal. Okay. He's very excited. Yeah. - Hi. - This is Paula. Hi. It's nice to see you again. And Carson. Hi. Nice to meet you officially. Ray's mom. - Yes, ma'am. - Nice to see you. - Hey, mama. - Hi. Harley, happy birthday, man. - Hey, thank you very much. - Hi. - Mrs. Carson. - Yeah. - You look very nice. - Thank you. Sir. Yeah, I used to have to call him "sir" myself. Let's go. Come on. - Okay. - Let's have a drink. Okay. That sounds good. May I get that? Sure. I haven't eaten all day. Let me... I have got to go. Ladies. Ladies. Just go easy on the shrimp, please. Oh, you. You kidder, Mr. Handsome. - He's such a silly boy. - Look at you. Look at you. You guys look fantastic. - Well, thank you, Carson. - Thank you. I... I am very sorry. I apologize. Oh, no. See, he gets on his knees. I can't believe he actually went down on his knees. Ooh. Not at all. Yeah. What's going on over there? You're not gonna like it. What, you've seen it? It's all over the Internet. Excuse me. I so needed this. I so needed this. Well, excuse me. Apologize for anything that I have ever said... It was a tactical retreat. Your cupcake rack. Will you please come back? Hey, kids, what are you doing here? Well, we heard there's free food. We raised 'em well. You should check out the view. You oldies like that kind of thing, right? Yes, we oldies like that kind of thing. Okay? Does this mean I get my couch back? I've fought a lot of battles, but never one quite like this. All I really wanna say is that I love you... And I can't lose you. You've made me the man that I am. I never gave you much of a wedding 18 years ago, and I hope it isn't too late. No, it's not too late. Sheila is fighting with the supplier again. Are you sure it was a good idea to hire her to run the other store? People seem to like her. How is that even possible? Thank you. I don't know. - Honey. - Here you go, sir. Honey, can you grab this? I'm buzzing right here. - Sorry. Sorry. - Thank you. Carson's phone, this is Janet. Janet, it's General brown. Is Carson available? Yes, he's here... of course, he's right here. Hold on. It's the General. Afternoon, General. Yes, sir. So what'd he say? I made brigadier General. Of course you did. Oh, my gosh. I am so proud of you. So proud of you. That's great. So how much time do we have? - Today. - Today. You're a different man than the one that came home. We're gonna miss you so much. I don't think so. What? I turned down the commission. I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna see you guys every single day... - What? - For the rest of your life. - Oh, my gosh. - That's so awesome. I love you. - I love you. - Oh, my gosh. That's incredible. Let somebody else be a General, okay? I wanna be an enlisted man right here at home. Awesome. There he is. Hey, Harley. All right. I'm taking everybody on a picnic. - Let's go. - Really? Ollie, get the door. I got all the picnic supplies right in here, come on. Harley, can I drive? Please, please, please. - Thank you. - Oh, my god. I'm in shock. Hurry up, Ollie. Okay, come on. Thank you, buddy. Everybody have their seat belts on? Go, go, go, go. - Yup. Great. - Got my seat belt. I got it. Relax, honey. Just take it easy. Give it a little bit of gas. There you go. Okay, now, just keep going straight down for three blocks...
