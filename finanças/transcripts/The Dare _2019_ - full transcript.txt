This... this conference is... It's the most important thing ever. I know. You already said that. Yeah. It's a big one. It's a game changer. Yeah, same as the last one, and the next one after that. Because I don't wanna, I don't wanna bring the girls up in my Mom's old house and I want them to have their own bedrooms. *sighs* They love sharing, you know? Almost as much as they love their Dad coming home. Yeah, well, this is it and then I am all theirs, and I'm all ours. If that's okay, huh? Bye. *footsteps* *howling wind* *footsteps* *hums* Jess, you seen the book the girls love? *books shuffle* *window opens* *clock ticking* Babe.

Remember. Remember what? Who saved me. Yeah. Good boy. Hmm? I just want my Mom. Your mother and father are scum. They abandoned you. If they cared about you, they'd have come looking for you, now, wouldn't they? I'm your father now. And if you upset me, I swear to fucking God... *whispers* Yeah. That's a good boy. *footsteps* *panting* *wheezes* Who's doing this? *restrains retracting* He was there when I got here. Kat calls him Paul. *wheezes* After my cat. Paul doesn't say much. *chains* Where were you when you were taken? Parking lot after a night out. Working the graveyard shift. *wheezes* *dramatic music* *chains clanking * *touches blood* *wheezes* *chains clanking* It's his playground. Whose? *wheezes* See, this must have been a mistake 'cause I'm a good person. I didn't do anything wrong. You see, I do charity. I... I gave blood once. Oh, get used to that shit. A big fan of the red stuff. I take it you've tried to talk to this prick? Oh, yeah. I've tried to hug it out, bought him flowers. One guy did all this? I mean, you're a fucking cop! Security guard. Well, you are. *wheezes* Good to know. *panting* *footsteps* *suspensful music* *opening door* Dominic! *panting* *forks scraping* Are you trying to test me? *food crunching* Hey, don't start with me, son. *lip smacking* Dominic? *chair squeaking* *chair sliding briskly* Father, I'm sorry! Are ya? Yes! Say it again. I'm sorry! Ssh. *screams* That's it. Let the evil out. *sobs* *wheezes* *panting* What was that? Feeding time. What's with the lights? Well, it ain't fucking Christmas. What, so he warns you before he tortures you? Yep. Only it's not him that does the torturing. Who does? *wheezes* *cell window opening* *cell window slams* *panting* *heavy breathing* *meat chewing* You're his pets. It's not even cooked. *meat chewing* No thanks. I'm vegan. *laughs* Of course, by vegan you mean fucked. Well don't waste it. Throw it back. *meat chewing* Quite the summer camp, ain't it? It's a big mistake, not eating. Not exactly Mother Theresa. *wheezes* What about Paul? He gets injections. They keep him alive. That's your future, right there. *chewing food* You two can do what you want but I'm getting outta here if it kills me. A very poor choice of words. *wheezes* *grunts* Come on! Any loose? Not yet. *scraping the wall* Nothing your side? Found this. Not been very lucky for me. What? *laughs* It's a waste of time. Like your police application? Like your mom's labor. *laughs* *panting* Not got any keys? Nope. Do you have any? *laughs* *screams* Shit! *groants* A hundred years, and nails like Freddy fucking Krueger wouldn't get through it. *groants* Or you could learn the hard way. Adam's right. The only way out is through that door. *wheezes* *sighs* *panting* *chains clanking* Hey. Seriously. If he sees you doing that, he'll go fucking insane. I had an ex just like you. He wouldn't give up either. I had to get his Dad arrested for raping me, just to get rid of him. So he deserved it. Oh, he didn't touch me. When I was 15, I'd set up dates with married guys. Take pictures send them to their wives. *wheezes* Fucking perverts. I'd give a nut right now to be back at home. Guess which one's gonna happen first? Gives the old ball and chain a whole new meaning, huh? You guys are fucking insane, you know that? *diggind with a bone Wait. Wait, wait. *laughs* Wait. *diggind with a bone Don't.

I don't know. You don't know. But you chose to do it. You see, every maneuver is a promise. A promise to your next maneuver and your next one. 'Cause life's all about choices. When you got no choice you got nothing. You chose to be here with me, didn't you? Dominic. *chair sqeaking* Dominic. I'm asking you a question. *object push* *shouting* Answer me! *coughs* *running water* *running* *lock opening* *wood scraping* Ugh! *panting* *running *shouts* Your mother and father are scum. They abandoned you. If they cared about you, they'd have come looking for you now, wouldn't they?

This is the world that left you for dead. *clock ticking* But ours isn't a strange world, is it, son? *clock ticking* I'll never let anyone hurt you again. Promise you'll never leave me. Yes, father. And you'll grow big and strong? I promise. Show me. *footsteps* Grow big and strong, just like him. *laughs* *metal branding* *burning skin* *pencil drawing* *footsteps* It's beautiful. *coughs* *footsteps* We're just like each other one and the same. *knife pull* Not all of us are kind. Some of us need to have the evil taken out of us. Does that mean you're evil too? Yeah. See, sometimes, we do bad things and the only way to take the bad out is through pain. I want you to stab it. Remove the evil. It's what's gonna make you a man, Dominic. Healing through pain. *dramatic music plays* I promise. I'm not gonna punish you. *sniffs* *knife penetrating skin* *grunts* Oh, that's it. That's it. Oh, good boy. Huh? That wasn't so bad, was it? Huh? Watch the evil, huh? Watch it leave me. *lightbulb buzzing* Oh, you... You motherfucker. What? What is it? Oh, come on, then, you fucking pussy. You enjoy watching-- *electricity noises* Have you never noticed this? Shut the fuck up for our sakes. What are you hiding from? I'm married, you prick. I have a fucking life. *eerie music plays* *cassette crunching* *country music playing* *insects sounds* *shouting* Come on! I'm waiting for you, you fucking asshole!

Bring it here. *chair squeaking* Who did that? Doesn't matter. Why? I said it doesn't matter. Sit down. How come it doesn't matter? *shouting* Sit! Come here. It's alright. *dramatic music plays* *bug being crushed* *chains clanking* Whatever you're doing, don't. *lights switching* Fuck you, man. How many times I gotta tell you? Paul tried that.

Is there a way out? Oh, so we didn't suffer for nothing. Great. We can escape. *sighs* We just need to be clever. *wheezes* What's he doing? He's just pissed you're back. Why is everything a fucking joke to you? The joke's on us, my friend! *speaker feedback* *country music plays* *lights switching on and off* What's he doing? Why doesn't he just kill us?

You've gotta stay with us. *panting* *wheezes* You guys ever seen his face? Oh yeah, he's gorgeous. No. We haven't. *wheezes* So what's the freak hiding? I don't know. Probably just ugly. Never kissed a girl. No, specifics. Come on, you guys have clapped eyes on him more than me. He stinks. Yeah. We all stink. More. *moans* He doesn't speak. Right. More. Paul, shut the fuck up. What was that? Just leave him be. Schh! He's trying to speak. *wheezes* Paul, what? *wheezes* *mumbles* Horse- Horse, what? *moans* What are you trying to say? *wheezes* Paul? Horseshoe. He has a a horseshoe burn on his hand. I saw it when you tore his glove off. Oh my god. Paul was trying to tell us. There's spiders. Worms next? I know you. I fucking know you. *eerie music plays* After the farmer's wife died he went crazy. Started wearing a pig skin mask. Locked his kid in the old farmhouse. Didn't let him out of his sight. Made him eat the pigs alive and then one night, when the sky was at its blackest the old man sharpened his axe until it was ripe for scalping. The kid was hiding. All he could hear were his footsteps. Louder and louder, closer and closer. *sighs* Police found what was left of the kid in the scalding chamber. Skinless. And they say the farmer still stalks these woods looking for his next victim... *laughs* It's not true. Is so. Creepy farmer. Stuff of legend. I'd kill that crazy freak. *burning fireplace* I don't think I could. Think about it. Actually ending a dude's life. Let's go find the farmhouse. *burning fireplace* What's that? *cracking coming from the wood*รก *gasps* Shit! *running* *panting* Kat, Kat, come on. Kat. *screams* Dominic, the boy. What the fuck are you talking about? The traveller, Kat. The one with the horseshoe burned on the back of his hand. It was my family summer vacation. Holy shit. *footsteps* Hey. He's still following us. *footsteps* Hey, what's that scar? Whoa. Looks like a wiener. *laughs* Yeah. Wiener fingers doesn't say much, does he? Say Adam's a fucking asshole. Adam's a fucking asshole. *laughs* So. Horseshoe. You wanna hang with us? *footsteps* You could replace . *shouting* Yah! *laughs* What's your name? Dominic. Well, you can be in our gang. *running water* Just needs to pass the dare. *crickets* *gasps* *panic breathing* *screams* *mumbling* Stop. *whimpers* Oh shit! Did you swallow that? Ugh. *whimpers* *screams* *running* *panting* *footsteps* You do wanna be in our gang, right? *footsteps* *hammering nails* *panic breathing* *whimpers* Don't let them get in your eye. They'll eat your brain. *groans* Actually, let's leave him. *eerie music plays* Leave him? *footsteps* Oh, fuck. We left him in that creepy farmhouse. He's done all this 'cause he was in some house for a moment? Come on. It was more than a moment. I don't wanna him back here, okay, he can stay out for ever! *scremas* Get, boy. You get before I beat you! Stop it! No, don't say that! Stop it! No! What you say to me? *screams & cries* *footsteps* Someone's in trouble. *chimes clanking* I did it after they shot my horse. *chimes clanking* He was my best friend. I've got something really cool to show you. Don't worry, it's just us. *chimes clanking* *footsteps* I'm sorry but... this really is the final dare. Look, all you have to do is just go inside. I'll kiss if you do it. Show us how brave you travel kids really are. You wanna kiss me, right? Then go inside. 20 minutes. Make it 20 years. *laughs* *footsteps* *door opens* No wait! *door slams* Shit! *running* *screams* I went home that afternoon. I never thought I'd see you guys again. Did anyone see him after? The kid? My mom. She said .. don't go into that farmhouse. She'd known I was there. What month were we at the camp? My thirteenth birthday. August 25th. I had that big meeting tomorrow. It was the 24th. That's 20 years. We were kids, we didn't know any better. Neither does he. *sub bass drop* *crickets* *drawing* *eerie music plays* *footsteps* *hammer slam* Why aren't you working? I heard a noise. Bullshit. *whimpers* No! *leaves crunching* Ahh! *coughs* Oh sorry. *coughs* Get back to work. *footsteps* *door squeaking* *door slam* *wall scraping* *door closing* *footsteps* *wood breaking* *beating on wall* *door slamming* *footsteps* *glass breaking* *door opens* *door squeaking & closing* *papers shuffles *footsteps* *papers shuffles *dramatic music plays* *papers shuffles *paper & metal clanking* *door opens* *panic breathing* How dare you? *grunts* Okay. Ahh! *footsteps* *panting* Ahh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Ah! *grunts* No, don't! You, you had a son. Henry. Are you gonna kill me just like you killed him? I didn't kill him. It was an accident in the scalding chamber, he wasn't strong enough. You took me to replace him. Didn't you? I just wanted you to be stronger, huh? I hate you. You wouldn't last five minutes out there without me. No one loves you like I do. *eerie music plays* How do you love me? That scum outside? They're burning marks in your skin. Leaving you to rot. Well, surely they're a better scum than you. *body hits* *body dragged on floor* *eerie music plays* *footsteps* *engine ignition* *thud* *eerie music plays* I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said before. No wonder no one came looking for you. *chains clanking* What are you doing? Wait! Wait! No, stop! Stop! How can I let you live? A fraud in Henry's home. Please, please don't, please don't! Ahh! Ahh! Oh god, oh, stop! Tried to remove the evil .. to make you strong! No! Oh god, please! Please, please no! Father, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! But it doesn't leave everyone. *panting* Sorry, please! Let me go! No, no, no! Agh! Please no, stop! Ah! Oh god! Ah! *coughs* *grunts* *chains clanking* *grunts* *body hits* *liquid bubbling* *switch cracking* *chains clanking* *liquid bubbling Henry. It's Dominic. My parents were looking for me.

Oh, oh! *scremas* *body burning in liquid* *moans* *chokes* *eerie music plays* *drawing* I need to tell ya a secret. The only way you'll ever truly be free is if you find them. Those that abandoned you. When you're big and strong, no matter how long it takes no matter how hard you look, bring them back here and let the evil out. *eerie music plays* *chains clanking* *footsteps* *chains clanking* *footsteps* We need to apologize. For what? We only knew each other two fucking days. At most. Think about it. When kids get bullied, who do they want to like 'em more than anyone else? *laughs* What a nicer place to make friends. Ah, think about it. If we can tap into even just a chink of humanity in that fucked up head of his. And do what? Just let us go? Better the devil you know. Exactly. Jesus Christ. Fuck you, I'm getting outta here. *chains clanking* Alright. Huh. Dominic. *shouting* Dominic! *shouting* Dominic! *knife slamming on table* *light switching on and off* *cell door opens* *chains clanking* *cell door opens* *footsteps* *light stick buzzing* *shouting* Yeah! No. Dominic. Now we know who you are. And we know what we did. It was wrong to leave you. Now, I can't claim to know or... or where to understand I can't. What you've been going through in the past the past 20 years. What I do know is that each one of us is sorry. *snarls* Huh? We're so sorry. We wanna get out of here, we do, man. We wanna get out of here with you. *panting* *chokes* No, no. No! *electric buzzing* *whimpers* *chains clanking* *heavy breathing* Oh come on, man. Spiders.

No! *screams* *cries* *knife pulled* Hey asshole! That's right. *grunts* *chains clanking* No wonder we left you to rot. *chokes* Look at you. A girl wouldn't kiss you to save her life. You're nothing but a waste of skin. Leaving you was the best thing we ever fucking did, you fucking freak! I'll kiss you then. *chokes* No one will ever love you. All you have to do is just go inside. *screams* Your mother and father are scum. They abandoned you.... I'm your father now. No one... *whimpers* *chains clanking* *cell door closes* *screams* Get it out! Cut me loose. *groans* *screams* Get it out, oh shit! Has it gone inside? Oh shit, you gotta pull it out! What? *sobs* Pull it out! Don't let me die. *screaming* Don't let me die! I'm not gonna let you die, I'm not gonna let you die. Wait, bite down. Right down. Hold him down.

Alright this it okay, he's gonna come for us. We've got nothing to lose. Just one other fucking eye. Oh, he's gonna kill me. Oh god, it's fine, you're gonna fucking kill me. It's best you hand over the knife. I need it more than you. I gotta protect myself! You're braver than me. No one's gonna get hurt anymore. That's easy for you to say, you got the fucking knife! Give it! No, Adam. Adam, come on. *grunts* Don't. Don't. Stop it! Stop it! *grunts* Stop! *grunts* Stop! *chokes* Adam. *chokes* *grunts* *chokes* *panting* Kat, it's not your fault. Kat, repeat after me, "It wasn't my fault." Maybe it was my fault. All of it. I never went back. I never checked to see if he was okay. After you left, the police came. Asking all kinds of shit about a missing boy. And you know what I told them? Fucking zero. All this time you knew? 20 years. 20 fucking years I held onto this shit and for what? You left him too. You could have saved him. You could have told someone. You could have stopped this. *panic breathing* Let her go. We just wanna go home. I returned to your world after. Still no family. You're a good kid, Dominic. No. I was still unwanted. An orphan. Came back here. The farmer was right. You are all scum! You were my friend. No. You abandoned me. Left me for dead. *panting* Why don't you let me see that face? *whimpers* I'm not gonna hurt you. Let me see, my friend. *soft breathing* *whimpers* See that wasn't so hard. I would have come and rescued you if I'd known what you were going through. *soft breathing* *sobs* Ahh! *gasps* *chokes* *knife penetrating skin* *choking in blood* *gasps* I failed.

Alright? *eerie music plays* *door closes* *fireplace burning* *eating Chinese food* *coughs* *snow hits body* *laughs* *kisses* Dad would kill us if he knew we were here. Dude... *sighs* Dad will never know. Besides, the freak's long gone. D-E-A-D. Fucked. I hate dares. Well then, you should have chosen truth instead. And you and Isaac could have stayed at home like little virgin snowflakes. *laughs* Is it really the same forest? Yeah. Not far from here. Your dad kicked his ass, right? Hells, yeah. Ten years ago tonight. No, I get it. *fireplace burning* Freak fed him cockroaches. Made them slice each other. Nailed them to the wall. He even kept their skin. But that's not all. Dude, pinned one of the prisoners down and... Got him with the worms! *laughs* Poppy! Oh. *laughs* So. Who's coming with me to find the farmhouse? Yeah, I'm game. Yeah? No, no way. You know they never found a body. What? Oh shit. Yo. I'm gonna go grab my gloves from the car. It's freezing out here, man. *footseps* *wood crack* *fireplace burning* Yo. Fuck this, come on guys. Come on, I'll, I'll bring the car around. *footsteps* We should go. *fireplace burning* Pussies. Poppy, come on! *eerie music plays* *screams* *end credits - country music plays*
