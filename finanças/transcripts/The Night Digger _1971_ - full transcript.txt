(female #1) 'We..' '...had..' '...a..' ...lot.. '...of..' '...hat--' Watch me, Jenny. "Top hat." (Jenny) 'Top..' '...hat..' (female #2) 'Good. Go on, finish the line.' (Jenny) '...on...his...head.' Alright, Jenny, same time tomorrow. - Bye bye. - Bye. Oh, hello, Robbie. Three months ago, she couldn't utter a syllable. You're working miracles with that girl. She's coming along. Look, Maura, we need you here badly. Not just two hours a day, but full time. A proper paid job. You know I can't do that. We got 14 stroke patients around here. You're doing just two of them. Miss Whitefield has the rest. She can't cope. You don't know how I had to fight just for those two hours. Get some else to look after your mother. You owe her nothing. She nursed me for five screaming years. Twenty years ago. I'm grateful for the offer, Robbie. I wish I could take it, but I can't. I've got to run. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] - 'Is that you, Maura?' - Yes, mother. (Mother) 'You're late.' Oh, damn this house, and everything in it. (Mother) 'Maura.' - 'Maura.' - Yes, mother. I'm coming. 'Maura, there's a draft.' There's a draft on my back. Not now, I've closed the window. Are you sure? Yes, shall I pull the blinds too? Oh, yes, and, uh, switch on the lights. 'I keep wondering how the bazaar's doing in this dreadful weather.' It will be a disaster. 'Mrs. Palafox will think of something.' What do expect her to do? Shelter the staff on her ridiculous bosom? 'That's quite enough.' 'Oh, made me lose my place.' Ah, there we are. (Maura) 'Mother, I want to talk to you..' '...about Mr. Bolton's nephew.' Oh, what about him? He's coming tomorrow. I think it's a mistake. I mean it'll be embarrassing to have a young man actually living right on top of us in the house. And how else, may I ask, are we to keep the garden in order? I certainly can't afford hired help. 'Oh, mother, you can. You know you can.' Don't contradict me. (Maura) Then let the garden go. Who cares if it goes to pot? I care. I'm not in the habit of letting things go to pot. The whole house is going to pot. Why don't we sell and move? (Mother) 'Never.' (Maura) 'And I could go to work full time at the hospital.' What's that? Robbie offered me a full time job today. On the staff with pay. I shall be left all alone. And no one to take care of me. Oh, mother, you won't. My salary will pay for a maid. [Mother gasps] What's the matter? My heart. My pills, I can feel my heart. - I'll get them. - I'll get them myself. Mother, please sit down. Come on, sit down. Better learn to do things for myself. Here, here they are. I told him I couldn't take the job. [intense music] [doorbell ringing] (Mother) 'Maura!' 'There's someone at the door.' We can't leave visitors waiting in the rain. [doorbell ringing] Oh, hello, Mr. Bolton. Sorry, I didn't hear. (Mother) 'Who is it, Maura?' Good evening, Miss Prince. I don't wish to disturb you. You're not disturbing us. Come in. - 'Who is it?' - It's Mr. Bolton. (Mother) 'Oh, come in, Mr. Bolton. I want to see you.' - Dear, Mrs. Prince. - 'Good evening, Mr. Bolton.' Maura, get Mr. Bolton a cup of coffee. - No, please. - Of course. Hurry up, dear. (Mother) 'What news of the bazaar?' You won't believe it, Mrs. Prince. It's been a tremendous success. And all thanks to Mrs. Palafox. Well, what did I say? Allow me. Crab apple chilly. Delicious. Thank you so much. Yes, she had us move all the stuff into the boys club before it rained. I knew Mrs. Palafox would save the day. - We are in her debt. - A remarkable woman. A truly remarkable woman. In fact, I've often thought, Mrs. Prince if only she had been the Reverend Palafox and, well...vice versa. She's such a splendid organizer and he.. We all love him dearly, do we not? But he isn't exactly what you'd call a "live wire." If you see what I mean. What do you mean, Mr. Bolton? I just think they're the wrong way around. The wrong way around? I mean that Mrs. Palafox should really be a man. Are you suggesting that Mrs. Palafox should have an operation? (Mother) 'What a dreadful thing to say.' No, no, no, I didn't. I wouldn't dream of suggesting it. I can't bear to think about it. Disgusting idea. But, my dear Mrs. Prince, I didn't say-- That is quite enough, Mr. Bolton. We won't discuss it any further, the subject is closed. It really is remarkable what these doctors are transplanting nowadays. I come with a message. With a what? With a message from young Jeffrey, my nephew. He is most appreciative of your offer. We're looking forward to having him. Regrettably, Mrs. Prince he has now found alternative accommodation. Uh, a little closer to his place of work. You mean, he isn't coming. That's the youth of the day for you. Utterly unreliable. This is most inconvenient! Don't despair, Mrs. Prince. I shall soon find you a substitute. A substitute? Who do you think we are? - I mean-- - A nephew, yes. I won't have strangers. [intense music] [engine revving] These fish fingers are burned, Maura. I know. I'm sorry. I do dislike burnt food. [doorbell ringing] Oh, that'll be Mrs. McMurtrey. - 'Hello, Mrs. McMurtrey.' - 'Good evening.' (Mrs. McMurtrey) 'Oh, isn't it terrible? Is it never going to stop?' Yoo-hoo! It's only me. Oh, come in, Millicent. My, my, what a day we've had. Maura, open a jar of preserved peaches. And make some custard. Mrs. McMurtrey and I will have dessert. (Mother) 'Millicent, Mr. Bolton has told me something very interesting.' She's going to have an operation. - Who? - Mrs. Palafox. What sort of an operation, for heaven's sake? It'll be an operation to turn her into a man. Edith! What are you talking about? You're not serious? I'm perfectly serious, Millicent. Gracious me! He said that the Reverend Palafox would have to be operated on the same time. But Reverend Palafox already is a man. Oh, to turn him into a woman. Edith! Oh! That's the most awful horrible thing I've ever heard. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Does that mean that she.. Mrs. Palafox will become the minister. [intense music] [engine revving] [engine revving] [vacuum cleaner whirring] [tapping on glass] [no audio] What do you want? Can I see you a minute, please, ma'am? What about? It's to do with a job. Jeff told me to come. Jeff who? Jeff Bolton. He said his uncle knew you. You're Mrs. Prince? That's my mother. Are you a friend of Mr. Bolton's nephew? 'Well, yes, ma'am.' Jeff said you give board in exchange for jobs. Not any longer. Uh, I thought you needed someone for the garden. We've decided to hire a gardener. Well, I can do gardens as good as any gardener. No, I'm sorry. [vacuum cleaner whirring] Where is Mrs. Prince? She's resting, I can't disturb her. - It was good of you to call. - I don't mind waiting. That would be pointless. I'm sorry, I've interrupted your work. I'll wait here. [whistling] Mother, are you awake? Oh, umm.. There's someone to see you, a boy. Who? I don't know, I-I.. He wants the gardening job. The gardening job? He's in the winter garden. I tried to get rid of him, but he insists on seeing you. What shall we do? [sighs] Maura.. - Who sent him? - Mr. Bolton's nephew. - What does he look like? - Just a boy. Stupid. No, you know what I mean. Does he look an honest, clean living soul? I wouldn't recommend him, mother, really. You don't like him? No, I.. Mother, we don't want him. - Was he rude to you? - No. You just don't like him, huh? Where is he? He's here. Good afternoon. I'm Mrs. Edith Prince. What is your name? Billy, ma'am. Billy Jarvis. Jarvis, eh? - 'How old are you?' - 'Just 20, ma'am.' What do you do? Ma'am? Where are you employed? I've been working the farm. Well, that and looking after mother. My mother was ill, you see. Oh, for more than two years. Then she died. She died last Christmas. I see. Was it your mother's farm? Oh, none, ma'am. We were just tenants. Take off the chain. - And where was this farm? - Cheshire, ma'am. On the Welsh border. But these last three months, I've been doing road work. Working the road gangs building new roads. - Where? - All over the place. Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, you know. I've been working my way south. Oh, hell. Why did you leave Cheshire? I wanted to get away. Right away. You see, the farmhouse caught fire. It burned to the ground. Gracious me! I was in the valley, I saw it, but couldn't get back in time. Well, I suppose you'd done any good if you had. I could have saved mother. (Edith) 'Oh, dear.' She couldn't walk. She was stuck in bed. You poor boy. [crow cawing] You know something, miss, I could fix this place for you really super if you just give me a try. I could paint the whole house inside and out. And I could clean up the kitchen garden. Put in winter vegetables, you know. 'Cauliflower, Brussels, broccoli, that sort of thing.' I'll put the tiles on the roof. Stop the rain come pouring in. Nice to have our own vegetables again, eh, Maura? Mother, I really don't care. She thinks we ought to let the whole place go to pot. If I were to give you a trial, I should require a reference. A reference? [telephone ringing] (Maura) 'Hello.' 'Oh, hello, Mrs. Palafox.' Just a moment. She says, "Would you like a lift to church on Sunday?" I shall walk. (Maura) 'She thinks she can walk it. It was good of you to call.' 'Yes.' Yes. See you there. Goodbye. Jesus didn't use a motorcar. No. He used a donkey, didn't he, ma'am? You're quite right he did. Do you think, ma'am, I mean.. ...would it be possible for me to go with you to church? (Edith) 'Do you usually go to church?' (Billy) 'Used to go every Sunday back home.' - Which denomination? - Uh, which what? Which church did you go to? Oh, just the.. ...just the ordinary little old church. 'The ordinary little old church in the village.' Well, we're church of England here. Yes, that's exactly what we were. (Edith) 'I'm delighted to hear it.' 'I knew your name started to recall someone.' 'Now I've got it.' An aunt of mine married a Jarvis. A vicar. I do believe they lived in Cheshire. Now, isn't that interesting? Did you hear that, Maura? For all we know, you could be a nephew of mine. A great-nephew. [chuckling] Well, well, well.. That's that. Oh, mother, come on. Well, if my great-nephew is coming to church on Sunday.. ...he had better stay here with us. Hadn't he, Maura? Oh, thank you, Mrs. Prince. Thank you very much. Maura, show Billy his room. - Which one? - 'The old one, of course.' Mine? 'Why, naturally. You're not using it now.' (Maura) 'Why should he have my room?' A guest should always have the nicest room. A guest? And a relation. Relation my foot. Do as I tell you, Maura. That's my private room. It's got all my things in it. Everything I own. I'm not going to clear them all up for...for him. I only sleep downstairs to be near you in the night. It's only temporary. How temporary? (Maura) 'Well..' [Edith chuckling] 'Till I die?' 'Eh, boy?' (Maura) 'Oh, that's horrid, mother.' 'Why not one of the other rooms?' (Edith) 'I may be blind. I may have a weak heart.' But I have not yet abdicated as head of this household. Will you kindly do as I say? Come along then. Hold on a minute. [intense music] [crow cawing] [music continues] (Maura) 'I suppose the trunks are coming along later?' This is all I've got. Everything else was burned. Listen, I don't care where I sleep. - So if you-- - It's too late. I don't wanna take your room. Makes no difference to me. In this house, what mother says goes. Haven't you noticed that? Here you are. I hope you like it. Christ. If mother hears you speaking like that you'll be out on your rear. Oh, it's beautiful! Just see it stays that way. I don't want you touching anything, you understand? I'll give you this drawer. You can use this end of the cupboard. But nowhere else. Well, I don't need any drawers. This is all I've got, I told you. Your Bible and prayer book, I suppose. Oh, God, this is the ruddy limit. I dress in here. Now I have to take everything I own downstairs-- Well, don't. I'll go into another room. - You're staying right here. - Well, let me help you. No, just leave me alone! (Billy) 'I could take those downstairs for you.' (Maura) 'Out, will you?' [door slams] Where are you, boy? (Billy) I'm up here, Mrs. Prince. - What you doing? - I'm fixing the tiles. The rain must've been pouring in. I got myself a good worker. When you're done that, you can mend the window in my bedroom. (Edith) 'You finish the roof first.' I've already fixed your window, Miss Prince. I did it first thing. (Maura) Why, thank you, Billy. Do you mind if I asked you a thing? No, go ahead. That leg of yours, and your hand. 'An accident?' Not exactly, no. Were you born with it? (Maura) 'If you really want to know, I had a ruptured aneurysm.' A what? A bleeding on the brain. Jesus Christ. Yeah, that would make you limp. (Maura) 'Try it sometime and see.' When was this? Years ago. Is it so noticeable? No. Of course not. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. That's alright. 'I made you a pie.' 'It's only apple.' Well! Well, that's great. Hmm. (Billy) 'You really are a terrific cook.' Didn't you ever think about getting married 'when you were young?' When I was what? I mean.. How old do you think I am now, 90? No. Of course not. Well, you're not more than 50, 55? [melancholic music] [music continues] Oh, thanks. Is it alright if I smoke? Don't let mother smell it. So...you've been living in this house all your life.. ...with her? Actually, she's not my mother. She adopted me from an orphanage when I was 15. Oh, I see. What do you mean by that? The way she treats you. She treated me pretty well, if you want to know. Better than I've treated her. I walked out on her once. When? Oh, about five years after I came here. I was 20. 'Why did you walk out?' Never you mind. Sorry. (Edith) 'Maura!' 'Where's Billy?' Here, ma'am. 'Come here, Billy. I wish to see you.' And now she's got two of us together. - You settled in, boy? - Yes, ma'am. Good. I'll clean the kitchen garden up tomorrow. Not tomorrow. We don't work on the Sabbath. You haven't forgotten you're coming to church? Oh, no, ma'am. Well, of course. Yes. Well, I wanted to talk to you about that, Mrs. Prince. You see, I've got a bit of a problem. There you are, mother. Well, it was nice of you to save a bit for me. What sort of a problem? Well, when the farm caught fire, I lost just about everything. - Well, so.. - So you haven't got a suit? Uh...no, ma'am. I ain't got nothing. How tall are you? 5'11", ma'am. Maura, help me up. That's only three inches taller than my husband. The trunk. Maura, I want the trunk. I'm going to lend you, Billy, my husband's best suit. Oh, no. Please. (Edith) 'It's 28 years exactly since he had it on' 'but there's plenty of mothballs in here.' 'Should be in perfect condition.' You are a lucky boy. Isn't it marvelous, you won't have to miss church after all. Here it is. Maura, help me up. There. This is the actual suit he wore as he was laid out in the coffin. Oh, he looked so beautiful in it. With the white co.. It's still there. You mean, that came off a corpse? Well, it was almost new. Much too good to bury as I said at the time. Maura, iron it for him. That'll take out the smell. The smell of what? Moth balls. Now look.. You gotta help me. I don't wanna go to church. Oh, don't be silly. You've got to come now. I don't want to go, I tell you. I just wanna stay here. Why? What's the matter, Billy? I just wanna stay here. That's all. But why? Well, it's just, I don't get on with people. I'll do say wrong. I know I will. Well, there'll be lots of people in that church. I'll do say wrong. Nonsense. I'll tell you what to do. If I go to church, I'll get into trouble. What sort of trouble, for heaven's sake? Look. Church isn't as bad as all that. What are you frightened of? Oh, um...look. Do I really have to go? Nobody can force you. Would she kick me out? Mother? Yes, I'm quite sure she would after all the stories you've told. Why did you lie to her, Billy? I wanted somewhere to stay. A house. A house like this one. Oh, I just love this house. Just love it. Where is Billy? We're going to be late. - Billy! - I hate unpunctuality. I refuse to go marching down the aisle after the services start. Billy! Come on! Hurry up! We're waiting to go. [knocking on door] Billy! Please come. We're waiting to go. [intense music] Billy? Where are you? Billy! Billy! He was feeling sick, mother. He was in the bathroom. But he's better now. He thinks he can make it. [church bells ringing] [pipe organ music] [altar boys chuckling] [altar boys chuckling] (Rupert) 'Hymn 629. '629.' [organ music] * Onward Christian soldiers * * Marching as to war * * With the cross of Jesus * * Going on before * * Christ the royal master * * Leads against the foe * * Forward into battle * * See his banners go * [church bell tolling] (Rupert) 'And evermore served the in holiness' 'and pureness of living' 'to thy honor and glory through our only mediator and advocate' 'Jesus Christ our Lord.' 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ' 'and the love of God and the fellowship of the holy ghost' 'be with us all evermore. Amen.' [organ music] Time to go. It's over. - How are you, Mrs. Prince? - Hello, Mary. Mary Wingate, good day to you. - Good morning, Mrs. Prince. - Morning. Morning. Good morning. I wonder where Billy's gone. Oh, Billy can take care of himself. My dear, Edith. Good morning. Millicent! Good morning, Millicent. Good morning, Mrs. Prince. Good morning. Good morning, Ms. Henry. What a lovely morning. 'I see you have acquired a lot here Edith.' Yes. Who is he? - I haven't seen him before. - He's a relation of mine. For heaven's sake I didn't know you had any. He's my great nephew. Grandson of an aunt of mine Martha Jarvis from Churchill. His mother's just died. So, now you have a worker in the house after all. He's my guest, Mr. Bolton. I long to see him. Where is he? I thought that Reverend Palafox preached an excellent sermon. - Poor, dear, Mr. Palafox. - 'Where's Mrs. Palafox?' (Mother) 'I wanna speak to her about the bazaar.' [whispering] You know what-- I don't know what you talking about. - The operation. - Oh! - I can't bear to think of it. - Then don't! Do you know that when you had her leg amputated? (Millicent) 'Can still imagine you feel things all the way down' 'although it isn't there.' Shh! Here they come. Palafoxes. Edith Prince, hello. - Where's Maura? - Here, Edith. Greetings. Who was the young man, Edith? He's Edith great nephew from Churchill. - 'Really?' - Oh, he's a dear boy. His mother has just died. That was an excellent sermon, Mr. Palafox. Poor, Rupert. Did you know Edith he has into go to hospital tomorrow? Nothing serious I hope. Well, no operation is ever very pleasant, is it? No, indeed. One invariably comes a way with something or other missing, eh. Poor man. Is it something...internal, Mr. Palafox? (Mrs. Palafox) Oh, no, Edith, nothing like that. External. External is right. (Mrs. Palafox) Oh, it won't take a moment actually. 'They're just going to snip it off.' (Millicent) 'Snip it off? Oh, my dear.' (Mrs. Palafox) 'Well, you see it's got bigger lately, and that scares me.' (Rupert) 'Oh, it's only a little growth.' [intense music] Oh, well, there you are. Oh, hello. I see what you mean now. What about? Oh, about not being good with people. Nor am I. Wait there while I get mother. No, I'll go by myself. Oh. Alright. I shall wait. (Mother) 'What is it?' (Maura) 'Steak.' (Mother) 'Suddenly we're all living like millionaires.' 'We won't have any house keeping money left for next week.' (Maura) 'I just thought it was time we all had a decent meal' 'for a change.' Where is he? 'Better go and fetch him before it gets cold.' He's in his room. Billy! Lunch is ready. [instrumental music] Listen, mother want's to see you. Mother want's to see you downstairs...now. Oh, please come. What is it? Mother want's to see you. Now. (Mother) 'Is that you, boy?' Yes, ma'am. What's the matter with you? Are you ill? Why don't you come downstairs for meals? I get kinda depressed. (Mother) 'Depressed? Why?' My mother. 'Oh. I see.' Oh, wouldn't it help if you came down, and joined us? No, ma'am. Oh, well.. ...brooding never helped anybody. Sorry. [intense music] [door slamming] [music continues] [instrumental music] [indistinct chattering] [chattering continues] [screaming] The little runt. He can't do it. (female #1) 'He's bloody useless he can't do it.' [engine revving] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [whispering] Beauty. [wood creaking] [intense music] [music continues] [grunting] 'Quiet.' Keep quiet. Make damn sure you don't fight me. I don't wanna fight. I'll kill you if you make a sound. 'Don't make a sound.' Shh. Shh. One sound and you're dead. Aah! [engine revving] [metal clanking] [instrumental music] (Mother) 'What're you doing there now, Billy?' (Billy) 'Trying to fix this old arbor for you, ma'am.' (Mother) 'Glad to hear you're feeling better today.' (Billy) 'Yeah. I feel fine today.' 'Feel great.' You get these depressions very often? (Billy) 'No, just now and then.' 'Sorry I haven't started on the garden yet, ma'am.' 'This was kinda urgent.' (Mother) 'I want you to do whatever you think is right, Billy.' 'It's a pleasure to have you here.' Thanks, ma'am. - I brought you some tea. - 'Oh, Thank you.' Put it down there, will you? [birds chirping] [instrumental music] Good morning, Edith. Oh, sit down, Millicent. Are you sure you wouldn't rather go inside? No. No. (Mother) 'So, here we are with another autumn upon us.' 'Autumn agrees with me.' 'Seasoned mists and mellows...Keats.' 'Do you read Keats?' 'I can't stand these modern poets that don't rhyme.' 'Can you?' 'I do believe, Millicent, that you're growing deaf.' 'Are you still there?' (Millicent) 'You certain you did the right thing?' - 'What?' - 'Helping that boy.' 'A young stranger like that getting cheek by jowl.' Billy Jarvis, my own flesh and blood and a fine young man.. ...if you want to know. Ah, Maura doesn't seem exactly averse to him. Maura treats him as I do, like a son. Oh, look who's here. Dear Mrs. Prince, what a lively morning. What brings you here so early in the day, Mr. Bolton? What indeed. Someone you know well will be on the front pages of every paper in the country tomorrow morning. Mr. Palafox! He's had the operation. No. Mary Wingate. Mary Wingate? What in the world.. Mary was brutally attacked in the privacy of her own bedroom last night and carried off into the darkness. (Millicent) 'No. It can't be true.' Her night dress was torn to shreds and without a doubt she had been most indecently assaulted many times. Mary would never allow it. Oh, I can't bear it. And now she disappeared into thin air like all rest of them. (Millicent) 'Come and sit down, dear.' Come on. Mary's number seven. You don't mean th.. Of course I do. It's the same man. The traffic maniac strikes again. It's him alright. It was on the nine o'clock news last night. Not ten miles from our own doorsteps. Oh, dear and I'm all alone in my wee house. Well, I shan't sleep a wink. I don't think you'd exactly qualify for his attentions. He'll be miles away from here by now. That's his game. Never two in the same district. Mr. Bolton, I thought there were only four. There are six. All in the last three months. Liverpool, March 13. Joyce, waitress. Manchester, three weeks later Tyla Tucker, factory worker. Birmingham, three weeks after that. Lily Burn, prostitute. Then the pace steps and we have four in the last four weeks. Gloria Walters another waitress outside Coventry. Garland a bar maid near Oxford. Prudence Henderson, photographers model near Redding 'and now poor Mary Wingate.' But how could they be sure? Fingerprints, Mrs. Prince, the same one's in every case he leaves them all over the place. But who's fingerprints are they? Nobody with a police record that's for sure. And what's so fascinating about it all I don't think you know this, Mrs. Prince is that in every case a dress has disappeared with a girl no other clothes just the dress and a pair of shoes. He does more to them in their own bedroom rips off their nighties and.. We understand, Mr. Bolton. But Gloria Walters was done in a park and sure enough her dress 'and shoes disappeared with her but her poor little panties' were torn to shreds and her chest support-- But what does he do with these girls? You can't hide seven bodies. Not for long. There are a hundred policemen combing Meadowbrook for her at this very moment. Dogs and frogmen dragging the canal. Everything. But they won't find poor Mary Wingate. He's too clever. Too clever by far. [instrumental music] I'm getting better at it. Soon I'll be able to do it with one hand like you. There. How's that? And these are Brussels sprouts. Well, that's all we've got time for. But next year you can have all the vegetables you want. Billy, you're a wonder. I thought you like to look at these. They are beautiful blooms. I bought them from town yesterday. (Billy) 'You shouldn't have done this.' I've never had one of these before in my life. Lamb chops. Good. I shall have two. Only one each I'm afraid. House keeping money ran a bit short. Where on Earth did it all go to? (female #2) 'I don't think there's anything to worry about' 'I'm sure there isn't.' You don't think I should call the doctor? Frankly, I don't! She's just tired and crotchety that's all. (female #2) 'Her pulse is quite strong' 'and her blood pressure is not specially high.' 'She should be alright in a couple of days.' (Maura) 'I don't think she's taking enough rest.' (female #2) 'You really must make sure that she keeps off her feet.' 'It's very important for someone with a bad heart.' (Maura) She spent over two hours in the garden this morning. Could it be that? Two hours. That's much too much. (Maura) 'I told her that you know how she is.' (female #2) 'It's up to you to keep her in bed.' (Mother) 'Maura!' (Maura) I'll try. You sure I shouldn't call Doctor Robinson? (female #2) I don't think so but we'll keep a good eye. Bye. Lovely day. Thank you. Will you please tell Ms. Prince I think I will call in again on my way home tonight just to be on the safe side? Will you do that? Billy! [knocking on window pane] Billy! [glass shattering] Billy! Billy! Can you hear me? Boy.. ...come down here. Billy! 'Billy!' 'What's the matter with him?' [gasping] [falling down stairs] Mother. [intense music] Mother. Billy. Billy! 'Come here. Quick!' Billy, I need you. Please come. Doctor Robinson please quickly. 'Then try to reach him. This is Ms. Prince.' My mother's had an accident. She's unconscious. An ambulance, yes. 'You call the hospital, tell them to hurry.' It's an emergency. Thank You. - What's up? - It's mother. She's had a heart attack. They're sending an ambulance. Don't move until they come. I'll be going with her to the hospital. 'You'll have to manage by yourself.' Don't worry about me. I'll be alright. [harmonica music] [doorbell ringing] [owl hooting] Hello, nurse. Good evening. I'm to tell you.. ...Mrs. Prince had an attack. They've taken her to the hospital. Uh, Miss Prince went with her. How is she? 'Everything's alright.' Well, I am sorry. (District nurse) 'Did Dr. Robinson come?' (Billy) 'They took her in an ambulance.' But Miss Prince said for you to go on home. Well, I suppose that's all I can do. Well, goodnight. [dog barking] [birds chirping] [engine revving] [intense music] [music continues] [engine revving] [intense music] You're telling me, you've never had it before? You're a eunuch! That's what you are. A poor bastard. Get your hands off me! Get out! Get away, you poor little eunuch! Eunuch! Eunuch! Eunuch! Eunuch! (female over P.A.) 'Dr. Avalyn, please.' 'Dr. Avalyn..' There's no point in you sitting around here now, Maura. He's right, dear. - You sure she's out of danger? - Quite sure. I'll give you a lift home. Both of you. [owl hooting] [bird cooing] You! (Dr. Robinson) What about the boy you've got staying with you? What about him? I was just thinking...it's good you won't be alone in the house. She's going to stay with me. Aren't you, Maura? I will stay at home. Oh, no, dear, you can't do that now. What are you talking about? I'm old enough to be his mother. You're still a woman, Maura. - Thank you. - He's a man. I'll be alright. It's not a question of whether you'll be alright. It's a question of the proprieties. - Damn the proprieties. - Oh, Maura. I think she's old enough to look after herself. I certainly am. Tremble to think what Edith'll say. What you mean is, you can hardly wait to tell her. [intense music] [twigs snapping] [birds chirping] [panting] [bird cooing] [bird calls continue] [engine revving] [dog barking] Here we are, Mrs. McMurtrey. Now, dear, you've had a wretched night and so have I. Now, don't let's quarrel. Come in and have a cup of tea before you go back, please. I'd rather not, I'm exhausted. Please, Maura. Oh, alright. Thank you, Ronnie. Thank you for everything. - Thank you, doctor. - 'Pleasure.' (Dr. Robinson) 'Goodnight.' [dog barking] [engine revving] [intense music] [metal scraping] [clock ticking] [clock chiming] [engine revving] I'm sorry to go on about it, Maura. But I still don't think it's right. [sighs] I don't care what you think. You care what your mother thinks. I'm not sure I do any longer. Oh, now, you don't mean that, dear. I do mean it. It's time I stopped caring what mother thinks. And what everyone else thinks too. Look.. Do you know what I've been doing these last 15 years? I've been rotting away in that ghastly house looking after mother and cooking her meals and scrubbing out floors and washing her clothes. And why? Because I haven't had the guts to tell her to go to hell. I was good-looking once. [mellow music] I was such a beautiful girl. And I had such a beautiful man. And I ran away with him.. ...so she wouldn't scare him off like she did everyone else who ever came near the house. I lived with my beautiful man, for five whole months. As if you didn't know. And I was going to marry him. You didn't know that though, did you? I was going to marry him.. ...the very same month I got ill. You were well out of it, dear. Oh, what rot you talk. I didn't see him around when you came out of hospital. He ran away, didn't he? Left you high and dry. Your mother was the only one who stayed faithful throughout. And you know why? Because she thrives on sickness and misfortune and calamity. She loves it! Oh! That's not true, Maura. It damn well is true! 'I'm going to get you another cup of tea.' No, thanks. [owl hooting] [intense music] [dog barking] [music continues] [bird cooing] Billy! Billy. Are you awake? [bats screeching] [intense music continues] (Maura) 'Where are you?' 'Billy!' [glass shattering] Billy! Are you alright? What happened? 'Billy!' 'Where are you?' 'Billy!' 'Billy.' 'Billy!' 'Billy.' 'What happened?' [knocking on door] 'I heard something break.' [intense music] I'm sorry. I-I was worried. I heard a crash. What was it? It was.. Just the window over there, it broke, I'm sorry. 'But how?' Nightmare. Are you alright? I mean, did you cut yourself? I was outside the house.. ...trying to get in. - Outside? - It was burning. And mother was upstairs. And I couldn't get in. Will you stay with me, please? Just for a bit. Till I get over it. Of course, I will. You're in a cold sweat. Get into bed at once. Where are those pajamas, I.. Here, put them on quick, while I make you a hot drink. No, don't leave me! No, don't go, I need you. Alright. I won't. Come on.. ...put them on. Now, Billy.. What's the matter? Is it still the nightmare? You've gotta help me. I need help. Well, somebody's gotta help me. I'll help you. - I think I'm mad. - That's not true. You haven't seen it. You haven't seen me when it happens. - What happens? - 'I don't know what happens.' I don't even know what I'm doing till it's.. ...all over and it's too late, it's done. What is it you do, Billy? [church bell tolling] [whimpering] Shall I make you a cigarette? [mellow music] I can do them nearly as fast as you now. Here you are. A match. Why don't you tell me about it? Come on, Billy, tell me. Don't leave me. Please don't leave me. I'll stay as long as you like. I'll be alright in the morning, but don't leave me now. I won't leave. Don't make me tell you. I could help you a lot more if you did. No. 'I'd never tell anyone else.' Yes, you would. You'd have to. 'Never.' 'I'd never do anything that might take you away.' Don't you know that? 'Go to sleep.' I won't go. [intense music] [indistinct chattering] [siren wailing] - Is she coming at once? - That's what she said. Was the boy with her? She's probably giving him breakfast in bed. Hot rolls. I shall make a short and sharp. He'll be out within the hour. Oh, Maura's coming, Edith. About time too. We'll leave you, Mrs. Prince. See you later. Hello. [telephone ringing] Have I got leprosy or something? What on earth is going on around here? Sit down, Maura. I want that boy out of my house. 'Do I make myself clear?' What's poor Billy done? Except renovate practically your entire house free of charge. 'And the garden too.' I want him out today. Would you mind giving me one good reason? 'Be quiet, hold your tongue.' If I were you, mother, I wouldn't insist on this. You will do exactly as I tell you. He goes today. In that case, so do I. What's that? You can kick me out at the same time. I knew it! You fool of a girl! Fool! I suggest you replace me with Mrs. McMurtrey. - You get on so well together. - You're mad. I shall find a job and live in a flat in another town, in another part of the country. I wouldn't have believed it. You, Maura, are possessed by the devil. Sold your soul. My own daughter. I am not your own daughter. And never for one moment have you let me forget it. I saved you. I nursed you. I gave you everything. Maura.. Maura! [engine revving] [clock chiming] (vendor) 'Evening news!' Evening news! Evening news! "Local Nurse Missing." 'Evening news!' [intense music] 'Evening news! "Local Nurse Missing."' 'Evening news!' [music continues] (bank clerk) 'There you are, Miss Prince.' Eight hundred andtwenty four pounds. Nine and eleven. Thank you. And that closes your account. [horns honking] (Billy) 'That you, Maura?' (Maura) 'It's me.' 'What are you doing down there?' Just checking the points on the magnita. There...finished. Ought to keep the old girl in good condition. Do you know, how fast.. [mellow music] Christ. Do you know why I did it? Because I love you. [church bell tolling] [harmonica music] Billy.. Why don't we later on tonight.. '...get on that bike of yours and go far away to some..' '...marvelous place like..' '...oh, I don't know, the Scottish islands.' We could get a tiny cottage on the edge-- - A cottage? - Yes. I've got the money, nearly 800 pounds. Show me. Put it back. [mellow music] I want to help you, my darling. I want to look after you and help you and love you as long as I live. I don't care what that thing is you do. I love you, although it's wrong, my baby, my baby. [dramatic music] [engine revving] [seagulls squawking] [seagulls squawking] [sheep bleating] [chuckles] I love it. [melodious music] [seagulls squawking] Oh, I've lost our dog. You haven't seen him, have you? No, I haven't. I thought he might've run off to your place but your husband says he hasn't him either. He's sure to come back, isn't he? He never goes off alone. That's why I'm so worried. I do hope he's not fallen over the cliff. Oh, he's much too clever for that, Jenny. Pray to God, he is. Danny's away all day at market, and I don't know what he'll say 'if he finds I've lost him.' (Maura) 'I'll bet you anything, he'll be sitting at home' waiting for you, when you get back. - Well, I hope so. - Bye. [seagulls squawking] Billy! Where are you?
