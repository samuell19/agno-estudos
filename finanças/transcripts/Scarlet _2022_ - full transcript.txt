You can do so-called miracles with your own hands. "Scarlet Sails" - Alexander Grin SCARLET Come in. Good evening. I'm Raphaël. Marie's husband. Sit down. Have you come a long way? Yes. She's your daughter. Her name is Juliette. Juliette? She was born in my arms. She's as beautiful as Marie. She has her gaze. She has her eyes. Marie said you work with wood. You're sturdy. There's always something to do here. I'm alone here, with the blacksmith and his wife. I can't pay you, but I can put you up. Good evening. I'm staying at Madame Adeline's farm. You're poor Marie's husband? She was a good woman. - What will it be? - A drop of wine? Any work to be had here? What are you looking for? Woodcraft. To Marie. Leave it! Leave it! Calm down, madame! No! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! They're my husband's debts, not mine. Go find him! Ask him! Let me have my things! Load everything up. You like making the poor poorer! Let me have my things! - Bastards! - It's our job. You like it! You'll get nothing for them! They're rotted right through! And there we'll sleep, Lonla Until the end of the world, Lonla Until the end of the world Raphaël? Think they're fooling around? Hello. Hello. Hello, my ass. Madame Adeline. Your husband still hasn't paid me. This is Raphaël. - Hello. - He's gifted. Madame Adeline told me you might have work. Even for... one or two days. Show your hands. Those hands... can do anything. Kid, get me a 30 cm board please. Come. Lucas, hand me the tool box on the shelf. We're already 6 here. There's not enough work. There'll be orders. Wait and see what he can do. How's your work going? Nearly. The mast will be done by tonight. - Should be done. -Yes. That's good, then. The boss wasn't too hard on you? Everything alright? Good. You're lucky. Some others weren't so lucky. What's she saying now? Only good things. Well, I say... time to get back to work. I know, fellas. Come on. Well, guys... I'll be on my way now. Better luck next time. What do I owe you, Fernand? Two francs, one of them's on me. Here. - Thanks! - You're a good kid, Renaud. See you tomorrow, Francois. Gentlemen. Get home safe. Hello Madame Adeline. Why don't you ever answer Fernand? Madame Adeline? What are you hiding from me about Fernand? You want me to go ask him? So tell me. Have a drink. Fernand is a bastard. Much as I hate to say it... I hate to say it. A pathetic bastard. What on earth did he do to you? Don't shout. I took her in here, she helped me with the farm and house, always cheerful. She got on well with Fatima, Marek, the village. Always smiling... Did he rape her? So I'm not Juliette's father? Be quiet. That's why they all point at me? Why they stop talking when I go by? Everyone knew and no one told me? Juliette is your daughter. She went to the store one day, he cornered her and forced her. She spent the night out in the rain. As if it were her fault. When we're wronged, we blame ourselves first. A neighbor found her early in the morning, all huddled up, frozen stiff. I called the doctor, he couldn't do anything. There. Thank you. Joseph... Anna. So, Anna... 25 for this week. Why do the men make more? They're stronger. Go on Anna. Go on, Anna! This can't go on. Raphaël, 35. 35... there you go. 40, for good work. Thanks. Do you have a scrap of wood? I'd like to make my daughter a toy. Léon, Léon! Show Raphaël the wood scraps. That one's good. Thanks. See you tomorrow, Léon. Lucien! Lucien! Lucien! Raphaël! Raphaël! Raphaël! Lucien! Fernand! Don't touch me! The truth is he's the one who forced her! I have no choice, Raphaël. Give me another chance. Please. I really need to work. - It's important. - Let me pay you. I'm sorry. Why are you all looking at me? Don't you have to work? What's your problem? Get lost! We'll sing, we'll invent a song for the sorceress The sorceresses' song... Maybe you do have powers? - Maybe you too. - Maybe me too. Maybe you have a great power in you. I believe you have a great power in you. Feel it? We're three sorceresses. You're two little sorceresses and I'm an old sorceress. Juliette! What is this? What's under that? Remember the little song? My friend Pierrot... Lend me your quill to write a word Whose is this? The boss's husband's. What are you doing? I want to chuck it for firewood. I want to burn it. I don't want to see it anymore. It's for Juliette. Just have to tune it a bit. You can do that? Yes. You can tune a piano? Yes. Go back to your hometown. Scram! Have you no shame? Should've died in the war. I see Marie... She's at peace. She's looking over you, she's looking over Juliette. She says... Take care of poor Raphaël, she says. Poor Raphaël. That you'll do something with your hands. Show me your hands. You have gold in your hands. These hands will bring in money. You'll stay here with Juliette. She'll grow up here. And I see that your eye will heal. Do you believe me? You have to believe me! I don't believe in that stuff. Come here, little darlings. You'll do it with me. Watch... You'll see. Nice work. I'll take it all. Can you make more for Christmas? For mid-November? Perfect. What's your name? Juliette. - You like that? - Yes! Take it! Thanks. That's nice of you. Does it work? Yes. Let's see. You sure chose well. It's nice. This song is always pretty To warm us when it's chilly It makes us dreamy and dizzy This song is for you and me Me, you, you Me, me You! Hello, Mother. I'm tidying your altar. I found shells today. Look at these, they're pearly. Hello, Madame Magpie, you have magnificent wings. You're not like the others. Do you have powers? Where are you from? Wait! Can you take me to Mother? I think you'll like this book. Borrow it and tell me what you think. - Thank you. - Of course. And keep working the way you do. - Witch, witch! - Let me through! - Witch! - Get out! - Leave me alone! - Dirty witch! Let's go home. - Leave me alone! - Go away. - Witch! - Don't come back! Marek? Can you fix this for me? The string I used doesn't hold. Can you weld? I'll use nails. Can you do it for me now? - This afternoon. - I need it now. Hello, Madame. Hello. I'm looking for Juliette André's house. - Problems at school? - No. I want to talk to her father. Talk to me. I'm like her mother. Yes... but is her father here? - I'll go with you. - Thank you. The pigs are out! I made potatoes with lard. Your favorite. You know, Juliette, I spoke to your teacher. She said maybe you could go to a school in the city. When? When are we going? Next fall maybe? We'll see. We'll move there? You will. You know, it'd be a big opportunity to study in the city. All by myself? In the school? And you'd stay here? Listen to me, Juliette, I'll never make a decision without talking with you. We'll always decide what we want to do together. Alright? I'm not going, then. I don't want to leave you alone. My darling... It looks like the crew has abandoned ship. What's your name? My name is Juliette. You're Juliette? I talked about you three days ago to the king of the toads. The queen. Quite possibly, my eyes are failing me. In any case, she said that in the village, no one believes in magic anymore. No one sings anymore, except you. Here's your beautiful ship back. Thank you. The sails are magnificent. My father built it. When you're a beautiful young woman, one morning, you'll spot scarlet sails in the sky, they'll be for you. And you'll fly off with them to a distant land. A marvelous land. Everything you can imagine is possible, little one. Dreams can come true. You'll see. This... This... The problem, Juliette, is these toys don't sell anymore. Kids today want electric toys like that. That? Press the button there. That's what makes the kiddos dream. These are the toys I bought from you, and these are the ones I sold. I can't make ends meet. You have to find something more modern. Like what? You see how this one moves, you lift it, it moves. I know it's tricky with wood, but... Can't you at least take a few? I'll take those two for 50 francs, alright? Hello, Juliette. Juliette! Juliette, I heard there's a café being sold 10 km from here and I thought we could buy it together. What do you think? I'm not interested, especially not with you. I want to be nice, I know what happened isn't your fault. Look at the sky tomorrow, the scarlet sails are coming, to take you to the asylum! What was that about? Here. I'm happy. On the boat? For the passengers. - We could do it. - And the animals? We'll take them with us. Show them the open sea. You'll stay here with them. Thanks, Raphaël. - What do you think, Marek? - No. - She's coming. - We're not leaving without Ma. She's coming. Why do you want to go? You talk about things and places you know, but we could all just go make new lives elsewhere. Travel on a boat! Elsewhere is worse. It's always good to see the world. Cheers. Who wants my wine? Me! Here. I wonder what it is. They're beautiful! If you're a girl Be a thousand times braver than a boy If you're a girl Have no fear before danger If you're a girl Be a thousand times braver than a boy If you're a girl Have no fear before danger If you're a girl Don't cry out If you hear a noise in the night If you're a girl Boss, someone's here. Hello. - I'm Juliette, Raphaël's daughter. - I know. I came to ask for work for my father. I don't have any, sorry. He's the best craftsman around. I know. So? - Boss. - What? Raphaël could do the figurehead. The figurehead. Oh yeah? And you can be the model while he's at it. Think about it. You see? There is work. I'd like to go away, with you See the earth fall away Soar... Soar swiftly through the skies Hello, my Juliette! Come with me. They're for you. You stole them? Can't hurt if nobody knows, my husband said. The manager of the shipyard came to see me. I have big news. He ordered a figurehead for a big ship. They still make figureheads? It's a special technique but I'll manage. I'm so glad she'll be able to sail across the ocean... If he likes it, maybe he'll order other ones. Juliette, if only you knew how happy I am! What are you cooking? Jean... Why are you still here? Go back home. I like it here, why should I go? You're a good boy. - I'm a good boy? - Go home. I'm not going Fortuna, I came to get my plane back. I'm waiting for my plane. Louis won't come. - Why not? - I'm telling you, he won't. You think he'll give it back? He's crazy, he shouldn't have taken it. Don't play if you don't have any money. First time I lose! I don't like this. Go home now. You've drunk too much. Enough already, stop! No I'm tired, I don't want to. What are you doing! I don't have any money. Goddamn... I can't believe it. Don't touch anything! - You've done enough. - Let me do it. Don't touch! Jean! It's your plane, after all. It's your fault if you lost your plane. Win some, lose some. That's life. You lose a lot. A drop of dew Kite from days gone by Going towards the future A blue plane like a paper dream In the moonlight, in the summer light I hear the wind dancing on the sea I see streams of light And you come back to me Towards the sun On a boat with immense sails Scarlet sails, the color of stars I hear the wind dancing on the sea I see streams of light And you come back to me Jean! Jean! - Your carburetor's busted. - I wonder why. Need to fix a part. You calmer now? A little less angry? The meal was great, thanks a lot. Very good. I was by the river earlier and I heard a girl singing, beautifully. I don't know if she lives here. The nut from the Wretch Farm. Does she live here? She's always singing. Stop talking about Juliette. Why? Because! You're in love with her! - No. - You can tell me. She's totally crazy. She's not crazy. She's just a girl who's had a hard life. She's proud as a wolf. A family of criminals. Mean as your father! Keep quiet and pour. What did you say? How dare you! Get out! Get out of here! I'm finishing my drink. Get out! She's a nice lady. Witch. Everything's fine. No reason to be upset. Hello. They said there was a blacksmith here. What do you want? We have a broken engine part. It's a quick fix. - Here. - See, it's nothing. It's simple. - Let's look? - Yes? Thanks. He'll show you. Where can I find petrol, sir? There isn't any. - No petrol. - No. Alright. I'll go join my colleague. Am I interrupting? Stealing something? - Just looking. - Looking at what? Your plane. Why? Because I think it's beautiful. I never saw one up close. Has it taken you far? To the gates of the desert. Are you an adventurer? No? Just making a living. What do you mean? I make a living with my... With my plane. You make a living with this? Put that down. Give it to me. Shouldn't snoop. What's this? Leave it! Get down. I was a solitary child. Almost no friends. I spent my time daydreaming. - Now I've got no time. - No dreams? So many questions, Juliette. You know my name? I asked about you in the village. In the village? You have quite the reputation. What's wrong? Why are you leaving? Go back where you came from. What's wrong? - Hold on! - Leave me alone! I'd like to go away with you Far away Far away from here See the earth fall away What would I risk in the softness of the clouds I must leave my horizon behind See other shores Little swallow... Little swallow with big black eyes Little swallow, I love you I want to set forth on a wild ride speeding ahead Fly off like a comet As I fly away I'll seduce the sun The world down here is too narrow The stars are calling me... The stars are calling me towards freedom What's wrong? Nothing. Lot going on in there. Stop. Talk. You don't want to tell us? The real question is, do you like him? I don't know what to do. Listen to me, darling. He's an adventurer. And adventurers come, go, forget. That's how they are. Nonsense! Not all of them do. What do you know? Raphaël? Yes. What is it? Maybe they're right in the village. - I am crazy. - You aren't. Love is what's crazy, and dangerous. What should I do? If I were you, I'd go find him. You don't need a man. Look at me. Go ahead. - What's wrong, Juliette? - Nothing. Don't want to talk? Juliette, listen to me, life isn't kind to us, you know that. But at least we hope, that's what we live on. That's what keeps us going. There's no more hope. Dreams don't come true, you know. They've put us through the wringer. Huh, Marie? But when they see my work, they'll have to admit I'm a good craftsman. My love... Let's lift her up? Yes. Juliette! Papa! Papa, what's wrong? Don't leave me, I need you. I'll be back. Adeline! Raphaël... Does it work? I'm sorry. I treated your father poorly. I lost a talented craftsman. May he rest in peace. Look who it is. Little Red Riding Hood. How are you, Juliette? Coming from Grandmother's house? You've got nice hair. Gentle, he's a nice guy. - That mouth... - Hands off! Kiss well? Let her go, fellas. Let her go. - The red sails are coming. - Go fuck yourselves! See you at the Wretch Farm! Calm down! Calm down! That's all in the past now. I've come to make peace with you... We have to make peace. You're beautiful like that. Where are you, Juliette? Tell me, what have I done? What does he have that I don't? I love you! Jean... Jean! You imbecile. It's alright. Give me your hand. Don't move. "Swallow coming from the stormy cloud "Faithful swallow, "where are you going? "Tell me. "What breeze carries you away, wandering traveler? "Listen, I would like to go away with you..." Little Swallow "Far, far away from here, to immense shores, "Towards barren boulders, rocky shores, deserts." Subtitles: Jackson Giuricich Subtitling TITRAFILM
