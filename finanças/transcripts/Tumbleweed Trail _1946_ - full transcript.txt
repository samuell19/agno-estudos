THIS IS WHERE OUR PATHS PART. YEAH, I'D SURE HATE TO BE GOIN' WHERE YOU'RE GOIN'. GOOD LUCK-- YOU'LL NEED IT. HA HA! SO LONG. SO LONG. I GOT YOUR MESSAGE, BARTON-- WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? I JUST LEARNED THAT BILL RYAN WILL BE RIDING THROUGH THE PASS ON HIS WAY TO SANTE FE TODAY. THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO DO WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING TO DO. WE GET YOU, BOSS. COME ON, MEN. SAY, BLACKIE, WE DIDN'T GET HERE NONE TOO SOON. THERE GOES RYAN NOW. PERFECT TARGET FOR YOU. WHEW! FOR A MINUTE, I THOUGHT THAT HOMBRE HAD A CHARMED LIFE. WELL, THE JOB'S DONE. YOU MEAN HAVE EARNED YOUR CUT, BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE TO COLLECT. LISTEN, BARTON, YOU TOLD US AS SOON AS WE FINISHED THE JOB, WE'D GET OUR MONEY. TAKE IT EASY, BLACKIE-- THEY'VE GOTTA FIND OUT HE'S DEAD BEFORE I CAN HAVE THAT WILL OPENED. OKAY, BUT I'M WARNING YOU, WE AIN'T WAITING LONG. WELL, I SEE WE'RE STILL ON THE RIGHT TRAIL. THE FURTHER WE GO, THE MORE CURIOUS I'M GETTIN'. WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WHY? IF YOU KNEW, YOU'D PROBABLY TURN RIGHT AROUND AND HEAD HOME. OH, NO I WOULDN'T, RIDIN' THIS TRAIL WITH YOU IS BAD ENOUGH. I WOULDN'T BE RIDIN' ON IT BY MYSELF--TOO MANY OUTLAWS. THEN YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO CURIOUS. YOU KNOW, IT WAS CURIOSITY THAT KILLED THE CAT. I'D RATHER BE KILLED BY CURIOSITY THAN HAVING MY THROAT CUT. HA HA HA! COME ON. I DON'T TRUST THAT BARTON TOO FAR. NEITHER DO I-- HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A DOUBLE-DEALER. I AIN'T SO SURE HE'S GONNA PUT THAT FORGED WILL OVER, EITHER. YEAH, HE WAS ONLY RYAN'S HALF-BROTHER. IT DON'T SEEM RIGHT THAT RYAN SHOULD WILL EVERYTHING TO HIM. HE'S SURE TAKING A GAMBLE. WELL, HE HAD TO MAKE SOME QUICK MONEY. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW? JUST SIT QUIET AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Man: WELL, I GUESS SINCE ALL CONCERNED ARE PRESENT, WE CAN PROCEED WITH THE READING OF THE WILL. "THIS BEING MY LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT, "I, BILL RYAN, BEING OF SOUND MIND, "DO HEARBY BEQUEATH MY ENTIRE ESTATE--" JUST A SECOND-- I ALWAYS DID HAVE TROUBLE WITH THESE "WHEREAS'S" AND "WHEREOF'S". CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, LAWYER SMALL. YOU MAY DEPEND ON THAT, JUDGE. LET'S SEE, WHERE WAS I... YES, HERE IT IS. [ clears throat ] LISTEN CAREFULLY... "DO HEREBY BEQUEATH MY ENTIRE ESTATE, "BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY, "TO MY HALF-BROTHER BRAD BARTON." BUT JUDGE, DOES MY FATHER'S WILL EVEN MENTION FRECKLES AND ME? I'M AFRAID NOT, MISS RYAN. BUT THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG, HE JUST WOULDN'T DO THAT TO US. WELL, HERE IT IS, SEE FOR YOURSELF. THIS CERTAINLY PUTS ME IN AN EMBARRASSING POSITION, BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. IF THAT'S THE WAY BILL WANTED IT, THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOT TO BE. I STILL SAY THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. I HAPPEN TO KNOW FATHER NEVER HAD ANY LOVE FOR YOU. YOU KNOW, IT'S A STRANGE THING-- I NEVER HAVE READ A WILL THAT PLEASED A WOMAN. WELL, SO MUCH FOR THAT, I MUST BE ON MY WAY. BEING JUDGE KEEP ME PRETTY BUSY. SEE YOU MEN LATER. GOOD DAY, MISS RYAN. GOOD DAY, JUDGE. COME ON, FRECKLES. MISS RYAN. I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOU AND FRECKLES. BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU TO MOVE OFF THIS RANCH. IT IS NOW THE PROPERTY OF MY CLIENT, MR. BARTON, WHO DESIRES IMMEDIATE POSSESSION. BUT THIS IS THE ONLY HOME WE'VE EVER KNOWN. WE HAVE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. I'VE ALREADY GOT IT FIGURED OUT-- SIS AND I AIN'T GETTIN' OUT. YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME AN IDEA. COME ON. BRAD, EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WORKIN' OUT JUST FINE. SO FAR SO GOOD. YOU MIGHT BE HAVIN' SOME TROUBLE WITH THAT GIRL. IN THAT CASE, WE GET IN TOUCH WITH THE SHERIFF, AND HAVE HER AND THE KID THROWN BODILY OFF THE RANCH. I DON'T WANT THE SHERIFF CALLED IN ON THIS CASE. I CAN HANDLE THE HER MYSELF. WHEW! THIS IS A BLAZIN' HOT DAY. YEAH, AND I HAVE AN IDEA IT'S GONNA BE MUCH HOTTER WHERE WE'RE GOING. LOOK AT THAT SIGN. DO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PASS? THAT WAS MY ORIGINAL IDEA. WELL, SOMEBODY SURE MUST HAVE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. FIRST IT SAYS "WELCOME," NEXT IT SAYS "NO TRESPASSING." WELL, WE WON'T LET A LITTLE OLD SIGN KEEP US OUT. LOOK, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. THAT MAKES IT MIGHTY CLEAR THAT WHOEVER LIVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT PASS ABSOTIVELY AND POSOLUTLEY DOES NOT WANT ANY COMPANY. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. UP TILL NOW, YOUR CURIOSITY HAS BEEN WORKING ME TO DEATH. LISTEN--ALL THE INFORMATION I'VE EVER GOT OUT OF YOU SINCE WE'VE BEEN ON THIS TRIP IS WHAT I BEEN READIN' ON THEM THERE SIGNS. NOW WE COME UP ON ONE THAT HAS CURED MY CURIOSITY. THIS IS WHERE YOU AND I ARE DIFFERENT. WE'VE JUST COME UPON ONE THAT HAS AROUSED MY CURIOSITY. LET'S GO. I MAY GO, BUT I WON'T LIKE IT. HOW ARE THINGS PROGRESSING, DEADEYE? WE RAIDED HER RANCH YESTERDAY AND SCARED OFF HER COWBOYS. HOW ABOUT THE STOCK? WE HERDED ALL HER CATTLE INTO YOUR CORRAL LAST NIGHT, BUT NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT WITH THAT GAL. SHE'S DYNAMITE WITH A RIFLE. SHE TOOK POTSHOTS AT ALL OF US. IF IT WASN'T A MOONLESS NIGHT, SHE MIGHT HAVE HURT SOMEBODY. YEAH, SHE ALWAYS HAS BEEN A FLY IN MY OINTMENT. SHE'S BEEN A WILDCAT EVER SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL. BUT I'LL FIX HER-- I SENT LAWYER SMALL OVER TO THROW HER OUT, AND TO MAKE SURE HE SUCCEEDS, I SENT BLACKIE AND APACHE ALONG. HEY, SIS! LOAD YOUR RIFLE-- WE GOT MORE COMPANY. WHAT DO YOU WANT? DON'T BE ALARMED, MISS RYAN. I'VE ONLY COME TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH YOU. IF YOU'VE COME TO EVICT ME, YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME. MY DEAR YOUNG LADY, ALL I'VE COME TO DO IS ENLIGHTEN YOU AS TO A FEW POINTS OF THE LAW. I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING YOU'VE HAD TO SAY AND I'M NOT INTERESTED. I ASSURE YOU, THIS IS NOT A PERSONAL MATTER. WHEN YOUR FATHER-- MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE-- WHEN YOUR FATHER LEFT EVERYTHING TO MR. BARTON, THIS PROPERTY BECAME HIS, AND IF YOU INSIST UPON REMAINING HERE, YOU'RE DOING THE SAME AS TRESPASSING. EVERYBODY KNOWS A TRESPASSER'S LIFE AIN'T WORTH TWO CENTS. CALL IT ANYTHING YOU LIKE-- THIS IS OUR HOME, AND WE'RE KEEPIN' IT. YES, BUT I WOULDN'T BE INFLUENCED BY SENTIMENTALITY, IT MAY PROVE DISASTROUS FOR BOTH OF YOU. AS FOR YOU, YOU IMPUDENT LITTLE SQUIRT, YOU'RE ONLY MAKING THINGS TOUGHER FOR YOUR SISTER. AS FOR YOU, YOU'RE ONLY MAKING THINGS TOUGHER FOR YOURSELF. I HOPE YOU GOT PLENTY OF AMMUNITION, SIS. I'LL HAVE YOU OFF THIS PLACE IN FIVE DAYS OR EAT MY HORSE! THAT'S ONE MAN I'D LIKE TO SEE EAT A HORSE, INCLUDIN' THE SADDLE. YES. Small: AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT THE RYAN CATTLE. IT'S A FINE HERD OF STOCK TOO, BARTON. YOU KNOW, STOCK IS JUST LIKE MONEY IN THE BANK AROUND HERE. BETTER KEEP 'EM HIDDEN HERE IN LOST CANYON UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO DO BUSINESS. OH, NO, I'M STARTING TO SELL RIGHT AWAY, SO YOU MEN CAN GET YOUR MONEY. WHAT THAT DEBT YOU OWE OVER ON THE BORDER. YOU KNOW SCOTT AIN'T GONNA WAIT FOR HIS MONEY FOREVER. IF YOU DON'T PAY OFF, YOU AIN'T GONNA BE AROUND TO SELL ANYTHING. YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME ANYTHING I DON'T ALREADY KNOW. WHY DO YOU THINK I DID ALL THIS? LOOK, BARTON, I'M IN THIS THING JUST AS DEEP AS THE REST OF YOU. IF YOU LISTEN TO ME AND DO AS I SAY, I'LL GET US ALL OUT OF IT. WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES OF RUNNING INTO TROUBLE WITH SCOTT. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOU, THIS ESTATE REVERTS TO THE NEXT OF KIN. AND THAT MEANS IT GOES BACK TO THE GIRL AND THE KID. WHAT CAN WE DO? DEADEYE--SLIP OVER THE BORDER AND HAVE A TALK WITH SCOTT. SEE HOW MANY CATTLE HE'LL TAKE SO SETTLE BARTON'S DEBT. AND DON'T LET HIM KNOW WHERE I AM. RIGHT, BOSS, I'LL GET GOING. YOU TWO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN, AND DON'T LET ANYBODY UP THE PASS TO THE RYAN RANCH. WE'LL FREEZE THAT GIRL OUT YET. STRANGERS, AND THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN SIGNS. WONDER WHO THEY ARE? THAT AIN'T IMPORTANT. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO KEEP 'EM OUT OF HERE NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE. WAIT A MINUTE-- WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? RIDIN' UP THIS CANYON. YOU MEAN YOU'RE RIDIN' DOWN THIS CANYON. YOU KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS-- WHY ASK QUESTIONS? SHUT UP AND GET GOING. ALL RIGHT, DON'T GET MAD ABOUT IT. [ gunshot ] THEY'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS. WHAT'S THE TROUBLE? RAN OFF A COUPLE OF STRANGERS-- THOUGHT THEY MIGHTA COME HERE. Eddie: AND THEY DID. I GOT RID OF YOUR GUNS ONCE-- NOW, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE 'EM FOR KEEPS, HOLSTER 'EM AND KEEP 'EM HOLSTERED. THAT'S THEM. LISTEN, MISTER, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE TRYIN' TO TELL US WHAT TO DO. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF NERVE TRYIN' TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF OF AN OPEN TRAIL. YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT OPEN TRAIL-- YOU'RE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. IF YOU'RE SMART, YOU'LL GET MOVIN'. TRUTHFULLY, THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE IS TO ASK DIRECTIONS. THE ONLY DIRECTION YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN IS BACK OUT. DROP THOSE GUNS OR I'LL FILL YOU FULL OF PEEPHOLES. NOW, DO YOU MIND TELLIN' ME WHICH WAY TO THE RYAN RANCH? A MILE AND A HALF, STRAIGHT SOUTH. THANK YOU. GOOD DAY. DON'T WORRY, EVERYTHING'S GONNA WORK OUT ALL RIGHT-- YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE. OH, FRECKLES, I'M SO DISCOURAGED. I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT'S THE USE OF FIGHTING? THEY'VE JUST ABOUT BEAT US. WE HAVEN'T ANY MORE CATTLE, ALL OUR RANCH HANDS ARE GONE... I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE CAN HOLD OUT. YOU'RE RIGHT-- WE ARE JUST ABOUT BEAT. BUT I THINK WE OUGHTA HOLD OUT A LITTLE LONGER. I WANT TO SEE LAWYER SMALL EAT HIS HORSE. Eddie: BEG YOUR PARDON, MISS. WE'D LIKE TO ASK A COUPLE OF DIRECTIONS. STAY WHERE YOU ARE! IT JUST SLAYS ME HOW PEOPLE GET GREETED AROUND HERE. EVERYBODY'S SO GLAD TO SEE PEOPLE. SSH. QUIET, SOAPY. WE DON'T MEAN TO INTRUDE, BUT WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR MISS ROBIN RYAN. YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT PLACE AND I HAPPEN TO BE SHE. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'M EDDIE DEAN, AND THIS IS MY PARTNER, SOAPY JONES. HOWDY, MA'AM. HOW DO YOU DO? WE HEARD YOU COULD USE A COUPLE OF COWHANDS, AND THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS WE COULD GET TOGETHER. I'M AFRAID YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE. WE DO NEED HELP, BUT NOT THE KIND YOU CAN GIVE. YOU SEE, ALL OF OUR CATTLE ARE GONE AND ALL OUR RANCH HANDS HAVE BEEN RUN OFF, AND IN A FEW DAYS, WE'RE EVEN GOING TO LOSE THE RANCH. YOU ARE RUNNING IN TOUGH LUCK. WE SURE RODE A LONG WAYS TO FIND THAT OUT--LET'S GO. WAIT A MINUTE, SIS, DON'T LET 'EM LEAVE. THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK TO BE DONE AROUND HERE. SURE, BUT WHERE ARE WE GONNA GET THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT? YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT LATER. WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE A GAMBLE IF YOU ARE. WELL, I-I DON'T KNOW. AW, COME ON, WHAT DO WE GOT TO LOSE? ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE HIRED. MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME OVER IN THE MAIN BUNKHOUSE. WOULD YOU MIND TELLIN' US WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CATTLE? BRAD BARTON TOOK 'EM. WHO IS HE? YOU JUST RODE THROUGH HIS RANCH TO GET HERE. NOW I'M REALLY CONVINCED YOU SHOULD HIRE US. TELL US MORE. IT'S ABOUT TIME I TAKE A HAND IN THIS MATTER MYSELF. I'LL SHOW YOU MEN, INCLUDING MY LAWYER, HOW TO HANDLE WOMEN. ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO NOW, AND THAT'S THROW HER OFF. AND THAT'S ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED UP TILL NOW. FRECKLES AND I HAVE TRIED TO BLUFF 'EM ALONG, BUT I'M SURE EVENTUALLY WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP. OH, NO, DON'T EVER DO THAT. YOU GOT ME INTERESTED IN THIS GAME NOW-- WE'LL ALL BLUFF 'EM TOGETHER. YOU MIGHT BE SORRY. WE'LL TAKE OUR CHANCES, AND WE'RE GETTIN' YOUR CATTLE BACK TONIGHT. I HAVE A LITTLE IDEA THAT MIGHT WORK OUT. ROBIN? I'M GIVIN' YOU A LAST WARNING TO CHANGE YOUR MIND AND CLEAR OFF THIS RANCH. WELL, WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER? MY ANSWER'S THE SAME AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN. WELL, HOW WAS THAT? THEY LEFT-- THAT'S YOUR ANSWER. SOAPY AND I BETTER HIT LEATHER IF WE'RE GOING AFTER YOUR CATTLE. CAN I COME, TOO? NO, SON, THIS IS A DANGEROUS MISSION. YOU'D BETTER STAY HERE AND WATCH OVER MISS ROBIN. I KNOW A SECRET WAY TO BARTON'S RANCH, AND I KNOW WHERE HE'S KEEPIN' THE STOCK. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM WITH YOU. ALL RIGHT, FRECKLES-- GET SADDLED UP.

WE'RE DOIN' ALL RIGHT, SIS, WE GOT OUR CATTLE BACK. YES, THANKS TO SOAPY AND EDDIE. I'D GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO SEE OLD BARTON'S FACE IN THE MORNING. YOU BETTER QUIT MAKING SUCH BIG BETS-- YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY OFF. I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BET A LITTLE SM-SM-SM-- NOT SO MUCH, ANYWAY. BARTON, WE GOT BAD NEWS FOR YOU. NOW WHAT'S WRONG? ALL THE CATTLE'S BACK ON THE RYAN RANCH. HOW'D THAT HAPPEN? THOSE TWO SADDLE TRAMPS HAVE JOINED UP WITH MISS RYAN. WHY, BOSS, THAT'S PLAIN ROBBERY. GOOD. NOW THEY'RE IN JUST THE SPOT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. APACHE, RIDE INTO TOWN AND TELL MY LAWYER TO GET THE SHERIFF. IT'S TIME TO BRING HIM IN THIS NOW. BRING 'EM BOTH OUT TO RYAN RANCH-- WE'LL MEET YOU THERE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GOT ME PUZZLED. WHAT'S THAT? WELL, YOU SEEM TO BE SUCH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER THAT I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOUR REAL REASON WAS FOR WANTING TO HELP FRECKLES AND ME. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I CAN'T TELL YOU RIGHT NOW-- I'M JUST ASKIN' YOU TO SORTA TRUST SOAPY AND ME, JUST LIKE WE WERE PLAYING A LITTLE GAME. HEY, EDDIE, COME HERE A MINUTE. I GOT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU. EXCUSE ME, MISS ROBIN. WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? AND WHAT'S YOUR BIG IDEA? YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT I MEAN. WE HAD THE SAME TROUBLE BACK IN OKLAHOMA AND UP IN ARKANSAS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING-- I'LL THROW MY LOT IN WITH YOU ON ANY CASE, UNDER ONE CONDITION-- AND WHAT'S THAT? THAT YOU DON'T GET MIXED UP IN ANY WOMEN TROUBLES-- BUT SHE'S DIFFERENT. SO WAS THE REDHEAD. WHICH ONE? WELL, THE-- I HAD A HUNCH THEY'D BE SHOWING UP. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MAKING A FLAG OF TRUCE. DON'T BE FOOLISH. I'VE BEEN SHOT AT BEFORE BY THAT GAL. WITH THE PRACTICE SHE'S GETTING AT OUR EXPENSE, IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE SHE MAKES A DIRECT HIT. WELL, YOU DON'T NEED IT NOW, I'M WITH YOU--PUT IT AWAY. [ gunshot ] WAIT A MINUTE! QUICK! SHOW HER THE FLAG! HEY, THEY'RE WAVING A WHITE FLAG-- MAYBE THIS IS A PEACEFUL VISIT. INVITE 'EM OVER-- MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A PEACE CONFERENCE. ALL RIGHT, COME ON OVER. I'M GIVING YOU ONE MORE CHANCE TO LISTEN TO REASON. UNLESS YOU RETURN THE CATTLE I INHERITED FROM YOUR FATHER AND GET OFF THIS RANCH, I'M PREFERRING CHARGES AGAINST YOU FOR CATTLE STEALING. AND YOU KNOW THE SHERIFF AIN'T GO MUCH PATIENCE WITH A CATTLE THIEF. HE USUALLY HANGS A MAN-- I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT HE'D DO WITH A WOMAN, BUT I THINK WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETHING JUST AS BAD. MISS RYAN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH STEALING THE CATTLE. OH, AND WHO DID? I DID. I BROUGHT THEM BACK HERE WHERE THEY BELONG. THEN YOU'RE IN A WORSE FIX THAN SHE IS. LOOKS LIKE THE CARDS ARE STILL FALLING MY WAY. YOU KNOW, ACCORDING TO LAW, A CATTLE THIEF IS A WANTED MAN. AND A WANTED MAN CAN BE SHOT ON SIGHT IF HE MAKES ANY TROUBLE. YOU GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT, BARTON. I ADMIT THE CARDS ARE STACKED AGAINST ME-- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? I'M GONNA SAVE THE SHERIFF A LITTLE WORK. I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU MYSELF. Sheriff: HOLD IT THERE! WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS? YOU GOT HERE JUST IN TIME, SHERIFF. ARREST THIS MAN FOR STEALING MY CATTLE, AND I'M ACCUSING MISS RYAN AND HIS PAL AS ACCOMPLICES. THAT'S A PRETTY STIFF CHARGE, HAVE YOU GOT ANY PROOF? I'LL SAY I HAVE. THE CATTLE ARE IN HER CORRAL, AND THIS MAN ADMITS TAKING THEM. IS THAT TRUE? YES, BUT I DON'T THINK I COULD BE ARRESTED FOR THAT. YOU SEE, I DIDN'T STEAL THE CATTLE, I MERELY BROUGHT 'EM HERE TO THIS RANCH. AFTER ALL, THEY BELONG TO ME. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE-- HE'S LYIN', SHERIFF. BILL RYAN WILLED THEM TO ME, AND I CAN PROVE THAT BY LAWYER SMALL AND JUDGE TOWNE WHO READ THE WILL. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, LAWYER SMALL? HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I HAVE THE WILL RIGHT HERE. HERE'S A BILL OF SALE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN. "FOR $1 AND OTHER VALUABLE CONSIDERATIONS, "I, BILL RYAN, DO HEARBY SELL, TRANSFER AND ASSIGN "ALL OF THE CATTLE BELONGING TO ME "TO EDDIE DEAN." SIGNED, BILL RYAN. THAT'S BILL RYAN'S SIGNATURE, I'D KNOW IT ANYWHERE. HE COULDN'T HAVE GIVEN YOU THAT BILL OF SALE. HE'S BEEN DEAD FOR MONTHS. HE SOLD THE CATTLE TO ME BEFORE HE MET WITH THAT UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT AT THE RIVER. IN VIEW OF THAT FACT, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO WILL THE CATTLE TO YOU. THEREFORE, IT'S YOU, MR. BARTON, WHO'S BEEN BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE. BARTON, YOU BROUGHT ME OUT HERE ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE. I CAN'T ARREST A MAN FOR STEALING SOMETHING THAT HE ALREADY OWNS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SHERIFF-- THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. WHAT'LL MY CLIENT DO? THAT'S UP TO YOU-- YOU'RE HIS LAWYER, AIN'T YOU? IF YOU THINK YOU GOT A CASE, TAKE IT TO THE COURT. WAIT A MINUTE. AT LEAST YOU CAN ORDER THEM OFF MY CLIENT'S PROPERTY. NOT WITHOUT A COURT ORDER, AND IF YOU CAN OBTAIN ONE, COME INTO MY OFFICE IN TOWN AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. GOOD DAY, MISS RYAN. AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU FELLAS ARE SMART, YOU'LL GET OFF OF THIS PROPERTY UNTIL YOU GET THAT COURT ORDER. WELL, YOU CERTAINLY GOT OUT OF THAT BY THE SKIN OF YOUR TEETH. TELL ME, WHERE DID YOU GET THE BILL OF SALE? FROM YOUR FATHER, LIKE I SAID--WHY? AT LAST I'M BEGINNING TO SEE THE LIGHT. NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WERE SO ANXIOUS TO HELP ME, PRETENDING THAT YOU WANTED TO PROTECT ME AND BE MY FRIEND, WHILE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE PLANNING AND SCHEMING TO GET MY CATTLE. WAIT A MINUTE-- YOU'RE ALL WRONG. JUST THIS FAR WRONG-- TO FIND OUT THAT YOU'RE FAR WORSE THAN UNCLE BART. AT LEAST HE PUTS HIS CARDS ON THE TABLE, AND HE LETS YOU KNOW WHERE HE STANDS. WHILE YOU WORK WITH TRICKERY AND CUNNING. THE HOSPITALITY OF MY RANCH IS OVER FOR YOU, EDDIE DEAN! UH, MISS, UH, ROBIN, DO YOU MIND IF WE DON'T LEAVE UNTIL TOMORROW? EDDIE AND I GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO DO AROUND THE RANCH. I DON'T CARE WHEN YOU LEAVE JUST AS LONG AS YOU GET OUT! WELL, YOU CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU ABOUT WOMEN TROUBLES. HERE'S YOUR HAT, EDDIE. SO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE TOO, HUH? NO, EDDIE-- YOU STILL GOT ME FOR YOUR FRIEND. I WANT TO HELP YOU PATCH THINGS UP WITH SIS. I'M AFRAID THERE'S NOTHING ANY OF US CAN DO NOW. SHE'D NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING I COULD EVER SAY. I DON'T MEAN TO TALK TO HER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I MEAN TO SERENADE HER TONIGHT. SERENADE HER? SURE. WHEN A MAN CAN'T TALK TO A GIRL, HE CAN ALWAYS SING TO HER. THEN SHE'S GOT TO LISTEN TO HIM AND SHE CAN'T TALK BACK. I'M AFRAID IT WON'T WORK IN THIS CASE, FRECKLES. IT'S WORKED IN EVERY OTHER CASE I EVER READ ABOUT. MOONLIGHT, SONG, ROMANCE-- THEY KINDA GO TOGETHER. MAYBE THE KID'S RIGHT. HE'S AT LEAST WELL-READ. COME ON, EDDIE-- PLEASE TRY. YOU GOTTA MAKE UP WITH HER-- I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE. ALL RIGHT, SONNY. BUT REMEMBER, I'M DOING IT JUST FOR YOU. SOAPY, DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME? UH, WHY YES. SIT DOWN. HOW 'BOUT IT, EDDIE? THE TIMING'S RIGHT. UH, WHAT I WANTED TO SEE YOU ABOUT WAS THAT, YOU SEE, WELL, UH, WELL, I-I JUST WANTED YOU TO ENJOY THE MOONLIGHT. WELL, HERE GOES.

GRINGO, YOU STAY HERE WHILE I BREAK THE NEWS TO THE BOSS THAT YOU CAME BACK WITH ME. ALL RIGHT, DEADEYE, GET GOIN'. HELLO, BARTON. I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK, I WAS BEGINNING TO GET WORRIED. SCOTT SENT BACK WORD THAT HE'D SETTLE YOUR DEBT FOR 100 HEAD OF CATTLE. IT'S TOO LATE, I DON'T HAVE ANY CATTLE NOW. WHAT HAPPENED TO 'EM? THEY'RE ALL BACK IN THE RYAN CORRALS. SCOTT AIN'T GOIN' FOR THAT. WE'LL JUST HAVE TO STALL HIM TILL I CAN FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT-- HE SENT GRINGO BACK WITH ME TO HELP PICK UP THE CATTLE. YOU STUPID FOOL-- WHAT'D YOU LET HIM KNOW WHERE I AM FOR? YOU WANT TO SEE ME GET KILLED? I COULDN'T HELP IT-- I WAS IN A SPOT, BOSS. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. THIS GRINGO'S SUPPOSED TO BE PRETTY GOOD WITH HIS GUNS. I'LL SAY HE IS. LET'S HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH HIM-- MAYBE HE CAN HELP US OUT. YOU MIGHT AS WELL PACK-- OUR LEASE IS UP. YOU MIGHT AS WELL UNPACK. UNPACK? I'LL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND. I'M NOT STAYING ANYWHERE WHERE I'M NOT WANTED. SIT DOWN, SOAPY, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU GOTTA KNOW. WHATEVER IT IS, THE ANSWER IS N-O, NO. THE REASON WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE WE GOT A JOB TO DO. AH, SO NOW IT COMES OUT. WHAT IS IT? THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CATTLE STEALING GOING ON IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE U.S. MARSHAL ASKED ME AS A SPECIAL FAVOR TO HIM TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT. SO THAT'S WHY YOU WENT INTO THE CATTLE BUSINESS, HUH? I HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING AS YET, BUT I SORT OF FIGURED IF WE COULD FIND OUT WHO BUYS STOLEN STOCK, WE COULD STOP THE MARKETING OF THEM, AND IN SO DOING, WE COULD PUT THE CATTLE THIEVES OUT OF BUSINESS. HEY, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. WELL, I GUESS I'LL UNPACK. PACK. UNPACK. PACK. UNPACK. THAT'S ALL I DO. GOIN' AROUND WITH YOU IS MAKIN' A HOBO OUT OF ME. DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF. NOT QUITE SHARP ENOUGH YET. NO, BARTON, I'LL TELL YA WHY IT WON'T WORK, WHY WE CAN'T KILL DEAN OPENLY AND TAKE HIS CATTLE. THE EVIDENCE WOULD POINT AT YOU. BUT I'LL TELL YOU HOW WE CAN WORK IT. YEAH, HOW? FIRST WE SEND DEADEYE OVER TO PAY HIM A VISIT... [ cattle mooing ] ARE YOU EDDIE DEAN? THAT'S RIGHT. I CAME TO TELL YOU THAT BARTON OWNS AND CONTROLS THE WATER RIGHTS ON LAND YOU'RE GRAZIN' YOUR CATTLE ON. SO WHAT? WELL, I THOUGHT I'D TIP YOU OFF. I HEARD HE SAID HE WAS GONNA SHUT YOU OUT. OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL, I KNOW A CATTLE BUYER THAT AIN'T OVER 50 MILES FROM HERE. WHO IS HE? I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT NOW, BUT IF YOU HERD YOUR CATTLE OVER TO RED GULCH, I'LL HAVE HIM MEET YOU. FINE. I'LL START MOVIN' 'EM RIGHT AWAY. HEY. YOU AIN'T GONNA FALL FOR THAT TRICK, ARE YA? YUP. AND I THINK IT'S JUST THE BREAK WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. AND IT WON'T DO YOU NO GOOD-- THEY WON'T BE BUYING STOLEN STOCK. ALL THE SAME, IT MIGHT LEAD US TO SOMETHING WE SHOULD KNOW. IT WORKED-- HE'S LEAVIN' RIGHT AWAY. I'LL BE WAITIN' FOR HIM AT RED GULCH. AND NOBODY'LL EVER BE THE WISER. HE AND THE CATTLE WILL JUST DISAPPEAR. I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU, GRINGO. HE'S GOT DEAN HERDIN' HIS OWN CATTLE TO PAY HIS DEBT TO SCOTT. [ all laughing ] I COME BACK TO TELL YOU GOODBYE. THANKS. GOODBYE, FRECKLES. SO LONG, SOAPY. DON'T FORGET WHAT I TOLD YOU, AND DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES. DID YOU TELL FRECKLES? NOT YET, I'M GOING TO WAIT UNTIL WE'RE ON OUR WAY. OH, YES, ONE OTHER THING-- TAKE THE SHORTCUT OVER THE MOUNTAIN SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO RIDE THROUGH BARTON'S PLACE. DON'T WORRY-- HE'S THE LAST PERSON I WANT TO SEE. WELL, SO LONG, SOAPY. COME ON, FRECKLES, LET'S RIDE. [ cattle mooing ] THERE HE GOES. HE'S TAKING HIS PAL ALONG WITH HIM. AND I'LL BE WAITING FOR BOTH OF 'EM AT RED GULCH. FOLLOW HIM, DEADEYE, AND SEE THAT HE DOESN'T MAKE ANY MISTAKES. THE REST OF YOU COME WITH ME. WHERE ARE THEY GOING IN SUCH A HURRY? I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'LL SOON FIND OUT--COME ON! LOOK! IT'S BARTON AND HIS GANG. IF THEY STOP US NOW, EVERYTHING WILL BE RUINED. COME ON, LET'S RUN FOR IT. THEY'VE GIVEN US THE SLIP! WELL I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THEM. LET'S GET BACK TO THE RANCH. Eddie: HEE-YAH, HEE-YAH! WHEW! WELL, SOAPY, IT WON'T BE LONG TILL WE GET TO RED GULCH. YOU KNOW, EDDIE, I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING ABOUT THIS CATTLE DRIVE. IT WORRIES ME. IT MIGHT BE THE LAST TRIP WE'LL MAKE TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, SOAPY, I'VE NEVER BEEN WRONG IN FOLLOWING YOUR HUNCHES. I'LL CIRCLE AROUND AND GET THERE AHEAD OF YOU. [ cows mooing ] DON'T PULL THAT TRIGGER. DROP IT. TURN AROUND. [ gunshot ] TRY THAT AGAIN AND I'LL MAKE YOU LEFT HANDED. DEAN, I SWEAR I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE YOU. I SORT OF EXPECTED IT TO BE YOU, GRINGO. I HEARD YOU WERE OPERATING AROUND THE BORDER. IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT, YOU'VE GONE BACK ON YOUR WORD. YOU PROMISED TO GO STRAIGHT. I KNOW, AND I'VE STUCK TO THAT TILL NOW. BUT I NEEDED A LITTLE MONEY, AND BARTON PAYS OUT PLENTY. "WORK"--THAT'S A FUNNY NAME FOR IT. IT'S JUST PLAIN MURDER TO ME. WE GOT YOU RED-HANDED. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A CHANCE TO WORK ANYBODY ELSE OVER AFTER WE GET THROUGH WITH YOU. WAIT A MINUTE, SOAPY. THAT'S RIGHT, GO AHEAD AND STOP IT, JUST AS I GOT MY DA-DA-DANDRUFF UP. GRINGO, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE. PROVIDING YOU TELL US ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT BARTON'S DEAL. I'LL BE GLAD TO-- TALKING IS EASIER THAN SITTING BEHIND BARS. WILL YOU SHAKE ON IT? MY WORD IS GOOD, GRINGO-- START TALKING. WELL, I FIGURED WHEN I GOT RID OF YOU TWO I'D TAKE THE CATTLE ON OVER TO SCOTT, WHO WAS GOING TO SETTLE BARTON'S DEBT FOR A HUNDRED HEAD, AND THEN GIVE THE REST OF THE CASH TO HIM. THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO CRACK DOWN ON THE WHOLE BUNCH. IF YOU'LL STRING ALONG WITH US, I'LL DEPUTIZE YOU AND GET YOU A JOB FOR KEEPS. THIS TIME YOU'LL BE WORKING FOR THE LAW. AM I HEARING THINGS STRAIGHT? YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A LAW MAN OUT OF HIM? THAT'S RIGHT, SOAPY. BETTER TO HAVE HIM SHOOTING FOR US THAN AGAINST US. HMM. ANYWAY, GRINGO'S NOT SUCH A BAD EGG. HE'S JUST BEEN PLAYING ON THE WRONG TEAM. MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO BE ON OUR SIDE-- HOW ABOUT IT? IT'S A DEAL. FIRST WE'LL PICK UP BARTON, THEN WE'LL CRACK DOWN ON SCOTT. WHAT'S WRONG? WE GOT TROUBLE. WE BETTER CLEAR OUT, QUICK. TAKE IT EASY, DEADEYE. WHAT HAPPENED? THEY LAID A TRAP FOR US AND WE FELL RIGHT INTO IT. DEAN AND GRINGO ARE WORKING TOGETHER. PROBABLY ON THE SIDE OF THE LAW. NOW WHAT CAN WE DO? DON'T GET EXCITED. THIS IS NO TIME TO TO LOSE OUR HEADS. I CAN WORK THIS OUT. BETTER WORK FAST, THEY'RE ON THERE WAY HERE. APACHE, RIDE INTO TOWN AND GET THE SHERIFF. FORGET THAT-- HE'S THE LAST ONE TO CALL IN TO HELP. LISTEN, FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. IF THEY'RE LAW DOGS, WHO'S BETTER TO MEET THEM THAN THE SHERIFF? THEN WE'LL CHARGE THEM WITH THE MURDER OF BILL RYAN. HOW CAN WE PROVE THAT? IT WON'T BE NECESSARY. THE SHERIFF WILL TAKE THEM INTO JAIL ON THE CHARGE-- IN THE MEANTIME, BEFORE IT GOES TO TRIAL, WE WORK THE RANCHERS UP TO A LYNCHING. SAY, THAT'S GOOD THINKING. YOU OUGHT TO BE GOVERNOR SOME DAY. WELL, GET RIDING, APACHE. LOOK! THEY'RE ASKING FOR IT. YOU MEN TAKE COVER-- WE'LL GET 'EM AS THEY COME IN. SURE LOOKS QUIET AROUND HERE. YEAH---TOO QUIET TO SUIT ME. LIKE THE LULL BEFORE THE STORM. DO YOU THINK ANYBODY'S HERE? YES, AND THEY'RE EXPECTING COMPANY. KEEP ME COVERED. WE'LL KEEP YOU COVERED LIKE A BU-BU-BUG IN A RUG. SPREAD OUT. BARTON! YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. IT'S UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU COME PEACEFULLY. Sheriff: STAY WHERE YOU ARE! YOU AIN'T ARRESTIN' NOBODY. WE GOT THE GOODS ON YOU THIS TIME, APACHE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT. I'M ARRESTING YOU FOR THE MURDER OF BILL RYAN. JUST A MINUTE, SHERIFF! THAT'S BILL RYAN. YOU CAN'T ARREST EDDIE FOR MURDERING ME 'CAUSE I AIN'T DEAD. BUT YOU CAN ARREST BARTON FOR ATTEMPTING TO HAVE ME MURDERED. Sheriff: YOU HEAR THAT, BARTON? TAKE COVER! HEY, I SURE HOPE YOUR AIM IS GOOD. IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN. OHH!! WHAT'S YOUR HURRY, LAWYER SMALL? YOU BETTER STICK AROUND. WE STILL WANT TO SEE YOU EAT YOUR HORSE. FOR A FELLOW WHO KNOWS SO LITTLE ABOUT IT, YOU SURE LOVE TO FIGHT. ALL RIGHT, GET GOING! HANG ON TO THAT BRIEF CASE, SHERIFF. IT'S GOT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE NEED TO CLOSE THIS CASE UP. YES, SIR, I SURE LIKE THIS JOB. JUST IMAGINE, IT COULD BE ME THEY'RE TAKING TO JAIL. WELL, WE WON'T NEED THESE ANYMORE. OW! YOU CLUMSY IDIOT! I'D BEEN MISSING SOME OF MY CATTLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I ASKED A U.S. MARSHALL TO INVESTIGATE, AND HE ASSIGNED EDDIE TO THE JOB. I WAS ON MY WAY TO MEET HIM WHEN SOMEONE TOOK A SHOT AT ME. AND WHEN I FOUND HIM HE WAS HURT PRETTY BAD. WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE EASIER TO LEARN SOMETHING IF WE LET WHOEVER SHOT HIM THINK THAT HE WAS DEAD. AND TO THINK I ALMOST BOTCHED THE WHOLE DEAL BY ARRESTING THE WRONG MAN. [ laughing ] AND THAT EXPLAINS HOW YOU GOT THE BILL OF SALE. THAT'S RIGHT, I ALMOST FORGOT. HERE IT IS, AND YOUR CATTLE ARE IN RED GULCH. WELL, I WAS KIND OF HOPING-- I KNOW. AS SOON AS I SEE THE U.S. MARSHALL, I'LL MEET YOU THERE. UH-OH! HEY EDDIE-- QUIET, SOAPY. DON'T BREAK IT UP JUST WHEN THEY'RE GETTIN' TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. THAT'S THE ONLY TIME TO BREAK IT UP, SONNY-BOY. EDDIE, COME ON, WE GOT TO HIT THE SADDLE. GOODBYE, FOLKS.
