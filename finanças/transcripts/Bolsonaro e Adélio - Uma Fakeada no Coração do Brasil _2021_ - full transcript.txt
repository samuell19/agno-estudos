Rumours and conspiracy theories about the attack are spread The attack sends the campaign back to its comfort zone: the internet networks The stock market shoots up after the attack against Bolsonaro; dollar quotation falls 1% Now we are going to Juiz de Fora. I understand I am facing the biggest professional challenge in my life. It is a professional challenge to any reporter to report the backstage scenes of a very nebulous fact that changed the Brazilian history. Independently of any theory, of any hypothesis, there is no doubt that that stabbing, or so-called stabbing,... changed the Brazilian history and gave way to an authoritarian project. This fact must be well narrated. There should be no doubt about what happened on September 6th, 2018. We are going there in order to face this challenge. Please, wish me good luck. BOLSONARO AND ADELIO A fake stabbing into Brazil's heart An investigating report by Joaquim de Carvalho English subtitles by Jair de Souza Juiz de Fora Minas Gerais State It was about two months of investigation. The most complex reporting I have ever gone through. Just for you to have an idea, it involves all of these people. In order to understand the matter, or in order to find the truth in this case it is necessary to find out the connections among all these people. And that is what we did. It all began with a very suspicious going, a suspicious trip by Bolsonaro from Rio de Janeiro to Juiz de Fora. A very unusual trip. What does that mean? Bolsonaro used to travel with his security chief in his car. But on that day the security chief did not go in the same car because Carlos Bolsonaro wanted to go and so did a general, general Santos Cruz. They travelled in the same car. And Bebianno... and this is very, very important... alerted it many times, insinuated many times... that something strange had taken place. He said: "Carlos Bolsonaro had never gone to any of the campaign events with us." On that day Carlos decided to go. It was a short ride, Rio de Janeiro-Juiz de Fora a two hour's car drive. Carlos got into the car. He had a drone. He looked like a kid playing with that drone. And neither I nor captain Cordeiro could get into that car and not even Max of BOPE. As a result he left the car without his security jacket. The jacket wouldn't have prevented 100% of the hurting but probably would have put a limit to the penetration of the knife. But, returning to your question, Rangel,... I spent a whole year alerting. And I insistently told him "Captain, you will end up by being stabbed". It was an expression used by us, not only by me. Because those arrivals, those disembarkations at the airports they were making things very tense, very dangerous. Because, how could you know... who was in those crowds, and with what kind of intentions? Bolsonaro arrived in Juiz de Fora about half an hour or one hour in advance. Then he made his first stop at a treble. There, some people were waiting for him, some followers,... and then he talked to some people. His arrival in Salvaterra was very smooth. There was nothing unusual that would draw our attention or that differed from the other political events I had covered. Bebianno also arrived there. Bebianno followed Bolsonaro very closely. Later we could also see who organized with the president of the Commerce Association, who organized that trip. It was the federal deputy Marcelo ?lvaro Ant?nio, who would later become a minister. And he is from the state of Minas Gerais. Bolsonaro's first appointment in Juiz de Fora was a visit to a hospital specialized in the treatment of cancer. It is controlled by a women's association. At that time we suggested his visiting ASCOMCER because the media was by then hitting him very hard saying that he did not like women. And that the women were against Bolsonaro. And ASCOMCER is doing a brilliant work here. It is a women's hospital, managed by women, that is doing a very good job. And, besides that,... it is a hospital for cancer treatment. So we understood... that it would be very important, and also for his image,... to pay a visit to ASCOMCER's hospital. There was a fact here that drew the attention of the press. Some men, as well as a woman, dressed in black showed themselves up as voluntary security agents. They controlled the people's access to the hospital. The fact drew the attention because, as a candidate, Bolsonaro already had the protection of the Federal Police. There, we had a very different atmosphere from that we experienced in Salvaterra. His security staff were nervous, reacting to the press approach in an aggressive manner in his visit inside the hospital. Sometimes obstructing our work, our circulation near the presidential candidate... to register his visit there inside ASCOMCER. And that generated a row and a lot of tension. There was harsh discussion between the press and the security agents. And there was also another security group, who were not wearing any identification as police or any other thing They were some people dressed in black. The whole organization of this Bolsonaro's visit to Juiz de Fora, it was all organized by the Commerce and Enterprise Association of Juiz de Fora. The only thing that was not under our responsibility, and it is important to mention it, it was only and exclusively the security matter. Those security agents put up some protagonism. So they prohibit some people from entering the place That is, they select those who can go in with Bolsonaro into the hospital. At that moment there was some stress involving the press because they appeared to have some authority, which was not questioned by anybody. They could decide who could get in and who could stay there in the hospital. They say it was Marcelo Bormevet who was responsible for the planning of all this security apparatus that involved those voluntary security people. Which in itself is a security failure. Because, how could one know that all of them were really trustworthy? The then candidate stayed here for about 45 minutes After that he went for a meeting with business people at Hotel Trade, which was close by. My friends, I was already full of emotion as you can imagine. You managed to go along with in the car for part of the route, as it was then recorded. He had a bullet-proof jacket. Why didn't he wear it on that day? Well, I really don't know. Did you get to see the bullet-proof jacket Yes, it seems that when I got into the car with him at ASCOMCER in order to go to Trade Hotel in a black Pajero if I am not mistaken the bullet-proof jacket was there. Some days before that he had been in Rio Branco, Acre,... he was wearing a bullet-proof jacket, his assistants said he would always wear a bullet-proof jacket. It was in that scene at the stage when he took hold of a tri-foot tool and said: Let's shoot down all the PT members here in Acre. Why is it important to mention that the jacket was inside the car? Because there is a story version saying there was a change of vehicle and therefore the bullet-proof was not there in the stepcar. This is not true. He did not want to put on the bullet-proof jacket. He was advised to wear it many times, but he did not want to do it. And he put on a T-shirt that had been made to order for... for the narrative that was being construed... of a victim of the opposition, of someone who was trying to change Brazil... and the T-shirt he put on read "Brazil is My Party". And when you look at the photos... you do not see anybody else wearing that same T-shirt. And he put it on and refused to wear the bullet-proof jacket in a place where it was absolutely necessary to wear it. Because there were lots of people. Pork cutlet is one of the typical dishes of Trade Hotel. On that day, Bolsonaro arrived together with the president of the Commerce Association of Juiz de Fora. He prepared a lunch for the then candidate. The images of Bolsonaro's arrival and also those of his meeting with the businessmen were registered by a drone... and also in a video... found in one of the cell-phones used by Adelio Bispo de Oliveira. So, a doubt popped out: Had Adelio been here? or did someone who had been here send him the video Evidences: Videos found in Adelio's cell-phone. Either Adelio... was there, or someone recorded it and sent it to him. And in case of his own recording it would be impossible for him to reach the other place on foot because it was far from the following appointment Bolsonaro had. where the knife stabbing effectively took place. According to the Federal Police, the last photo he took... was at 14h40... When Bolsonaro arrived at 15h... somewhat about that, when he arrived at Parque Halfeld,... Adelio was already there. Therefore, by bus it would take him long... he could take a taxi, he could take an Uber, or he could be with somebody with a car... in order to be able to reach the new place. But this point deserves some attention. We have to pay attention to this. It is important to point out that Adelio... led a semi-miserable life. He was a bricklayer's assistant. At that time he would be doing some free-lance work as a waiter in a bar probably called "Bar do Ga?cho". He himself doesn't remember the name... twice a week. But he had very little money, theoretically. Then, Bolsonaro gets in... He first gives a collective interview. In this collective interview, a point that draws our attention... is that from the very first question he decides to attack PSOL. It is interesting because the narrative to be construed later is... that it was a PSOL militant who stabbed Jair Bolsonaro. Question: Do you have any proposition to contemplate our region's necessity for this museum? What spoils the museums in Rio de Janeiro are PSOL and PCdoB. Almost all the funds that were received were for the payment of pensions, favouritism, friends... and militants. There's no way for it to be all right. Another aspect that draws our attention, and we have this image,... in front of the press people he decides to take two kinds of medicine which he had been taking, one of them for the stomach. Because one notes that it's got antiacid or something like that... for the stomach. He takes it and goes on to joke with one of the photographers... He says straightly to him: Look, it it is not Viagra, it is another medicine. We don't know what it was for. And he took it. It is interesting. It is not a detail of minor importance... because Bolsonaro effectively had... manifested other illnesses previously. In an evangelical congress in Gide?es, Santa Catarina,... the pastor asks who would like to have some praying for the cure of any problem in the stomach. And then he would say a prayer. And so Bolsonaro rises up, Michelle puts her hand exactly... where the knife stabbing would be. There is someone else, perhaps also a pastor,... who also puts his hand and then they make that prayer. There is information that on a trip to Cascavel,... on a campaign tour, Bolsonaro had some problems and was taken to a hospital. That was a little before, a few months before the stabbing event,... or the so-called stabbing event. Then Bolsonaro took this medicine... and makes a speech to the businessmen who are present... and then two facts deserve attention: First: among the people present, those who had paid for their presence,... was a doctor of Santa Casa, who would later operate on him. His name is Paulo Gon?alves. According to the president of the Commerce Association, this doctor... was wearing a yellow T-shirt. One of the few who were also wearing yellow. Then, this doctor asked saying it was very important because he was an enthusiastic supporter of Bolsonaro,... he had been in our business people lunch... wearing a Bolsonaro T-shirt, coincidentally,... and he left the lunch at about 14h... and when it was about 15h, before 16h, he was summoned... together with Santa Casa staff in order to assist Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro didn't stay for lunch. He tells the president of the Commerce Association he couldn't stay because there were too many people... and he thought he wouldn't be able to have lunch. Jair Bolsonaro stayed for about one hour in this restaurant. He ate fillet-mignon and drank soda water. One of the waiters that waited on him... asked permission to take a photo with him. And he says that the then candidate was in a hurry. He wanted to move on quickly to Parque Halfeld, where Adelio Bispo de Oliveira also went to. He ate a dish that is very famous here in our house... which is the famous paillard de mignon. which is a dish well..., as he had said he was in a hurry,.. "I want a quick dish, tasteful,...", then I suggested the paillard de mignon. Then he said: "Ok, it will be that." We ordered it, and that was the dish he ate on the day of the stabbing. With this we eliminate that hypothesis... of his having being prepared for an administered knife stabbing as one gets prepared for colonoscopy. He effectively ate and... Colonoscopy is the indoscopic examination of the large and lower intestines. It is carried out mainly for the detection of cancer in its various stages. General Santos Cruz, whom I interviewed, he said that... he went to this restaurant, Assunta,... and he went to say farewell to Bolsonaro, to say: "Look, I'm leaving earlier because I want to avoid the traffic congestion in Av. Brasil." But it was not very clear what he had been doing all that time there. At that time Bolsonaro leaves Assunta restaurant... and goes towards Parque Halfeld, where the Town Hall is located. Jair Bolsonaro was advised by at least one of the security agents to wear the bullet-proof jacket. He refused. Bolsonaro went that way. Towards Halfeld street. About 400 metres ahead... the knife stabbing event took place. Or the so-called knife stabbing event. The arrival at Parque Halfeld This stop at Parque Halfeld, where we got off,... this was already pre-planned. What had not been pre-planned, at least for me by that time,... is that he was going to walk down all along the pedestrian street. Mainly because on the previous day the security personnel had alerted it was dangerous. Because it is a gallery with various buildings on both sides of the street... there might be a risk of his being shot from one of those apartment buildings... We remade Adelio's way,... I analyzed every photo, face by face, in order to identify Adelio in those images... as from the moment Adelio comes up into this story. It was so that I identified him in my colleague?s photos right in the beginning of the pedestrian street. And if you look at a strange image... which we recovered for this documentary film,... you will find Adelio, behind the truck where Bolsonaro was giving his speech. He got up onto the truck after arriving at Parque Halfeld in Juiz de Fora,... he got up and there were lots of people there. And instead of watching the speech,... Adelio remained at the back, walking about to and fro. And at a certain time,... he moves towards Carlos Bolsonaro as if he wanted to talk to him. And Carlos Bolsonaro appears to get scared and gets into the car. This is a hypothesis that demands investigation. It is a suspicious behaviour. And he himself later told... Leda Nagle that Adelio tried to go onto him. But if he was familiar with Adelio. At least they both had been together in the same place. On July 5th, 2018... Adelio and Carlos Bolsonaro shared the same space... in the .38 Club. There is a specific moment in the video of my father in Juiz de Fora... in which I leave the car and Adelio starts walking towards me. And by chance I return to the car. And when I got back into the car... he walks back because he noticed that would not be able to get to me. Just by chance I did not leave the car at any moment. I did not go out of car at any moment, just by chance. This citizen named Adelio... he had been at the .38 Club which I frequent on the same day I was in Florianopolis. What is most strange in this story... is that Adelio was already waiting for Jair Bolsonaro... with a newspaper in his hand,... apparently with something inside the newspaper. He himself said it was a knife. And nobody noticed. There was no no kind of approaching. And he was walking to and fro as if waiting for something. Or for some guidelines about what to do in that afternoon on September 6th, 2018. It was not a figure to go unnoticed. One notices he was wearing a black jacket. In a moment... It was September 6th,... On September 6th, it is no longer that cold. That means that a well prepared security staff... they would notice these characters moving about. The security agents are there specifically to identify any kind of menace. They are people trained for this kind of job. It is amazing that even the judge commented... that he found it very strange that the security personnel had not noticed... that Adelio was wearing a black coat in spite of the warm weather in Juiz de Fora. This is something very suspicious. Policemen sometimes wear coats because they carry weapons inside them. That should already have raised suspicion. But Adelio remained undisturbed.. At a certain moment, Adelio is staying practically inside the security ring. The security agents were behind him, at his back. It is here where Adelio was staying in Juiz de Fora. This used to be a boarding house. The ex-owner died a little time later after the knife stabbing event. The death of this lady was caused by a cancer. According to reports of the time,... Adelio arrived in Juiz de Fora some days before Bolsonaro's visit. He asked for the best room and paid for it in advance. Cash. Another fact that has to be registered... is the proximity of the boarding house chosen by Adelio in Juiz de Fora... to Parque Halfeld. Not more than 5 minutes walking at most. 400 to 500 metres. Now, this is important:... Adelio had already recorded in his cell-phone the places where Bolsonaro was going to be. So, Adelio... may have got aware of the agenda through the newspapers as he said. Yes, he may. But it is precise. In Adelio's cell-phone, they found... besides the conversations of the day at the hotel,... they found photos announcing Bolsonaro's arrival in Juiz de Fora,... In his cell-phone he had images of Trade Hotel, a photo. He has photos of Parque Halfeld. And he has photos of a cultural foundation,... where Bolsonaro was not programmed to go, but he ended up going. Adelio photographed the interior of this FUNALFA. And FUNALFA was not in Bolsonaro's agenda. But he photographed it beforehand, he had internal photos of it. And when he leaves, there is someone behind him... someone with a shaved head,... and this person appears beside Adelio all the time... and when the knife stabbing takes place... instead of trying to attack Adelio as many other supporters tried to do... and the security agents barred,... instead of paying attention or... being worried about what had happened to Bolsonaro, as many others did, looking at Bolsonaro,... he keeps only looking at Adelio... as if he was worried, but without showing any aggressive attitude towards Adelio, as the others... were expressing. But he is behind Bolsonaro in a photo we have... He is behind Bolsonaro when Bolsonaro leaves FUNALFA. And why is this important Because Adelio photographed the interior of FUNALFA one day before that. That was found inside his cell-phone. And then, Bolsonaro is on the move down the pedestrian street... On the way there, we have photos of that, Adelio attempts an attack... and although there were plenty of security agents, they did nothing. Strip of the documentary film A facada no mito Channel: True or Not The candidate touches the man's hand and in sequence the guy starts a backward counting with his fingers The action starts and Adelio approaches and in sight of the people around he draws an object from his jacket See how clear Adelio's intention was and how the security agents simply ignored the aggressor The agent in the cap literally holds Adelio's hand and looks into the face of the aggressor with a knife in his hand The candidate keeps looking at the other side with his right hand in the air, leaving his body exposed for a strike On seeing that the attempt failed, they pull the aggressor back and the man in the blue T-shirt got hold of Adelio The agent has his cap turned down by one of Adelio's strikes and he looks clearly in the aggressor's direction Here we see that Adelio still holds the object in his hand and close to the body, as well as to the agents We also notice that the group has gone back of their own, as there is no congestion between them and the candidate The agent falls down and Adelio follows him, as if he had dropped something He pulls and makes an attempt. That is completely absurd. And they don't do anything. There were lots of agents and Adelio was very close to the agents. In some photos it looks as if he even interacts with the agents. We can see that there is a clear interaction between the group and Adelio At that moment the candidate waves a signal for them to stop Another agent gets into the turmoil and in sequence makes a positive sign indication to the candidate And there is also a very strange talk... from a policeman of the secret corps... a policeman who was there in plain clothes a military policeman he shot everything, because he was shooting everything,... and there's a recording in which he says to Adelio, he appears saying: Calm down, be patient. Now it is not possible. Not now. Did you understand? Now it is not possible. This is exactly what is recorded there. "Calm down, man. Calm down. Calm down, man. Calm down, man, it is not possible now." After this first attempt,... which was not successful, things went on normally, they kept on walking... The Commerce Association's president... and his director, who was the operational responsible for the visit,... he doesn't want to talk to me. His name is Guilherme Duarte. When I interviewed Aluisio Vanconcellos, who was the president,... this Guilherme had talked to me and said he would give me an interview... and he said: It was I who organized all this, together with Marcelo ?lvaro Antonio. And after that, he did not talk to me anymore. We had even made an appointment, but he no longer talked to me. At a certain point, 30 metres ahead of the stabbing point,... this director said to the president: You had better leave here now and go to the Commerce Association... to receive Bolsonaro. I was there until about 4 or 5 minutes before... When we were getting to Batista de Oliveira street, going down the Alfete pedestrian street,... someone suggested that I waited at the entrance of the Commerce Association. He was removed from the crucial moment. That is what sounds interesting. So, this really drew my attention. Because he was removed from that crucial moment. Then, 30 metres ahead after Aluisio had left the group,... Bolsonaro then is involved in the stabbing affair. In Juiz de Fora, the stabbing affair is a taboo subject for many people. Therefore, while working on this documentary,... I had to face lots of situations full of aggressiveness. There was even a person who called the police to arrest us. When you look at the photos taken by the photographer Felipe Couri... He said he was photographing everything and, then, he lost the photo of his lifetime. The remembrances are not so good. In spite of everything, they are disagreeable. I think that the first thing to associate with this remembrance is resentment... that comes up... and it seems like a problem without a solution. The resentment is on the air, I don't know what it is in fact,... I don't know what it was, our hair stands on end, we feel a stomachache, we feel something very strong. I think it was even a kind of disappointment... In general terms, what was seen on that day was anything but... a democracy celebration, a democracy... with the social role of the citizens being exercised. So, for us, this brings back a remembrance that... I beg your pardon,... It is difficult for me to talk about it. However, you can see a video... that was launched in the internet, a very interesting video by a very mysterious channel,... True or Not I am trying to find out who's the owner of this channel. Because, the one who has created this channel really knows what happened. It was created with the sole intention of presenting videos about this stabbing. It has interesting theses... and the one who created it also edited it. It has a whole complex of images... which is not in possession of anybody else. At the very moment of the stabbing... I was not looking at... It was the moment when I diverted my eyes... Somebody or something drew my attention... And I diverted my eyes at the exact moment of the stabbing... When I return my eyes... when I focus my eyes again in Bolsonaro,... he is already in front of me. Until then, without my realizing,... without seeing or understanding what was going on,... Adelio was there, with some people trying to attack him, others protecting him... And Bolsonaro was no longer within my visual sight. The stabbing had already been executed in a fraction of seconds. With a single turning of the head, with a single turning back of my neck... to look in another direction,... That was the very moment... when the so-called knife stabbing victimized the candidate. At the exact moment of the stabbing, the photographer... was approached by a federal policeman who draws his attention And he, who was photographing everything, turns around... ...a federal policeman approaches the photographer... ...and forces the guy to move from his place... ...the photographer gets ready to go on recording... ...but someone else draws the photographer's attention at the exact moment of the strike... ...and when the guy turns back, the stabbing had already been done In my memory I cannot remember exactly what he said... and what I remember from that moment... And this I remember clearly, because... As I had asked, it was a voice alerting me of a post or something which I should divert from. But this voice came from my back. And in the video that we have just seen... someone says something, but I can't... I don't have it registered, I can't remember,... I am going to struggle hard to recover it, I'll keep this... inwardly... I don't remember, I don't remember exactly,... but in fact there was something... and I just realized it on seeing this video right now. Then, Adelio's head was practically under his legs. And other people holding Adelio. He has some very interesting photos. And then you notice that Adelio... they protect Adelio, and don't even immobilize his arm. What would be the correct procedure for a security agent Adelio would be holding either a weapon or a knife. He was with a weapon: a knife or a gun,... a pistol, whatever. But they left Adelio's hand free. He could have turned... and stabbed everybody there. Other people there would be stabbed. He could go on striking. But they protect Adelio so that Adelio... is not lynched by the crowd. There is a policeman in a muscle shirt who is over him... and he gets the kicks which were meant for Adelio. You see. It seems that practically he protected Adelio. All the images show... the event took place here. There is even a flag over there... with a wood handle... According to the workers of this pie shop... it was the municipality itself, the previous administration,... that decided to place that flag there to commemorate... that day, the September 6th, 2018. Jair Bolsonaro was taken to this place... and he was then laid down here. Lying here, with his head over there next to the trash bin. And his legs stretched onto the outside part. How did he react He kept looking upwards to the ceiling. They came and removed him not more than a minute later. - And, didn't he faint? - No. Not that I had seen. - Not even blood? - No blood at all. Wasn't there at least a drop of blood for you to wash away later? No, sir. Nothing, absolutely nothing. A retinue's car... came and very quickly removed Jair Bolsonaro to Santa Casa hospital. There is a security agent who is very trustworthy to Bolsonaro... You can see in the photos that Bolsonaro is often placing his hand over the shoulder... of this security agent,... He is a federal police agent, and he will be present at Bolsonaro's takeover ceremony later... as one of the police agents that run along the rolls-royce... which shows that he is really very intimate. And he is also a person that shows up in a very strange image... in which he touches Bolsonaro with his closed hand... and this image circulated in the internet networks... as if he was lightly punching Bolsonaro. This security agent, he really touches Bolsonaro... as if he was softly punching Bolsonaro. That was very strange. Was it a signal? What would that be? One cannot know. And this fact had some repercussion in the social networks, even among Bolsonaro's followers... They used to say: Look, here's a proof that they wanted to kill Bolsonaro. Until one of Bolsonaro's son twitted a reply saying... "No, this police agent is of my father's confidence. There is nothing wrong about him." Bolsonaro was taken from that place to Santa Casa hospital... At Santa Casa, one of the persons that received Bolsonaro... says that Bolsonaro got there unconscious and with his tongue spreading outside. It could be a reaction to an anesthesia. A hypothesis that was not investigated by the Federal Police... is that of an attempt organized by themselves. In order to generate a political fact. Let's remember that... there has been a mayor that was elected... after having received a very violent stone blow... and this stone blow ended up by giving him the election victory. That is just a remark that has to be made. Some Santa Casa's officials speaking off-record... guarantee that on that September 6th... Bolsonaro arrived here with a serious wound in his stomach. I tried to speak with Santa Casa's president, Renato Loures,... But, at the appointed time, he gave it up. His assistants say it was because of judicial reasons. Since he could not speak about Jair Bolsonaro's medical record. It was there that the doctors operated on him... and there came up a very serious discussion whose origin nobody seems to know... The Sirian-Lebanese hospital is contacted by somebody... And so, they go there to Juiz de Fora... and then there comes up that talk among Bolsonaro's supporters initiated by the very campaign leaders... insinuating that Sirio-Libanes hospital was communist. The Sirian-Lebanese hospital was communist. They were communist and, therefore, they could not receive Bolsonaro. So, they decided that he should go to Einstein hospital. And he effectively was sent to Einstein's. The Sirian-Lebanese personnel were there... but I, as a counselor of this hospital as well as Doctor Macedo,... and aware of the quality of our hospital, we said: No... we have to bring our president here. And then, I called up his son Eduardo Bolsonaro... he was going there by car... I spoke to him and he said: "Calm down, he will go to Einstein's." And I said: But all the media are saying that he will go to the Sirian-Lebanese hospital... Forget it, let them say it. Bring him here. The Sirian-Lebanese is also an excellent hospital, but... here he will be at home. Do you understand And the key to understanding this case... is with Einstein hospital... because Einstein refused... to hand Jair Bolsonaro's medical report to the Federal Police. They handed a very simple document... a brief note, which was not even signed... by the doctor who made the surgery on Bolsonaro,... who was an oncologist, a specialist in cancer treatment... that is Antonio Macedo. This reinforces the narrative that he already had a previous illness... and that effectively the operation on the following day was an operation... to extract, and it effectively extracted, bits of the intestines. Then the doctors extracted 10 cm of the large intestine... and carried out a colostomy. Now it is also important to register... that Macedo and Einstein later had some disagreement... Initially, Einstein... showed itself very close to Bolsonaro. Queiroz was treated there, he paid cash. And so far nobody knows where the money came from. Where did the money come from He paid about 80.000 reals in cash. Very few people would do this nowadays. But Einstein broke with Macedo. Now they both do not keep the relationship they used to have. Antonio Macedo was one of the main doctors of Einstein's. As an oncologist he occupied a very large space... and attended to many people, he still does, but now somewhere else,... He's now at that Vila Nova Star hospital, where Jair Bolsonaro has been treated. He's no longer at Einstein. This investigation has to be reopened. An independent investigation. The Federal Police itself must and should investigate it. But now with another focus. Considering both Carlos and Jair Bolsonaro as suspects. And the first step, or the first attitude... is to carry on a medical inspection... because there are evidences... This cut here is where the knife penetrated... This here is of the bag... from here to there. - Is it all right? - Yes. This here has nothing to do with the surgical insertion that we personally did... This is the knife's cut. It penetrated here. The scar changes its place. And a scar which was initially slight... very thin... as if it were a very light wound... but later when Bolsonaro shows his body to the press, to the cameras,... this scar becomes more acute, and it moved upwards. - And what about this? Is this the one of the surgery? - Three surgeries. - Three. - This is region of the knife stabbing... This hole is related to the stabbing. - And here if you want to sign "colostomy bag", you may sign here. - It was here, it was here. It was here. Is this the one of the bag - This is for the colostomy bag, here beside. - Ok. - Ok. The knife stabbing entered here It hit and turned around. - It hit and turned around? - It hit and turned around. And how can one know about this Because Bolsonaro has three spots, which are of his own body. And the first scar shown there... just a little time after Bolsonaro's takeover... just a little time after the knife stabbing event... It is below those three spots. And later, when Bolsonaro shows this scar again in another opportunity... some time after the Juiz de Fora event... the scar has moved upwards. The scar is over the three spots. This is impossible. I even consulted a doctor about this... and the doctor gave an explanation, he was doctor Marcos Caseiro,... who raised this possibility of a self-attempt... sometime before we began this project... and he himself said that was very strange. The scar itself... did not seem to be of a very serious wound... as it had been described at that moment. Adelio was immobilized here, at this spot. By security agents as well as by policemen. Then, Adelio was taken to this building where there is a watch shop in operation and there is also a school. Adelio was placed here at this point... He was brought over here... This padlock was used... to lock the door, because the crowd outside... wanted to get in in order to carry out a lynching. So, the policemen and the security agents impeded their attempt. Adelio was taken to the second floor... of this building and placed against the wall. And there he made his first declaration which came to the public. Adelio was arrested immediately afterwards. According to him, he stabbed the presidency candidate Jair Bolsonaro... because of his ideological disagreements with him. We have related the way everything happened. Very strange, as you could see. Now, even stranger... is the investigation. Or, the beginning of the investigation. How was the knife found The enquiry mentions a witness, Renato... He would have stepped on the knife, after the turmoil,... and he would have taken that knife and hidden it... and handed it to somebody else,... who happened to be someone who sold fruit... right near the corner, just there. And he handed him the knife and told him: Keep it. What I got to know is as follows: that a policeman arrived here and gave the knife... and he asked the other one who works here with me to keep it. And he kept it and soon after he returned... and he handed it back to him. Do you understand? I don't know if he was a policeman... But he handed him back the knife. That was true. The one who can explain this better is Perecin, because Perecin... went to the Federal Police station, he was urged to testify... and he stayed there for more than 3 hours giving his testimony. We went after Luis Perecin, the man who had received the knife Mr. Perecin I don't want to say anything. It is about the knife stabbing. I just wanted to talk about the knife stabbing. I don't want to know about any stabbing. Have you been stabbed -No. - Neither have I. Good-bye. - Good-bye. - All right, Mr. Perecin. Thank you. - How is that? - Get lost. - Are you attacking me? - Go away. - Shoot it. She has attacked me. Shoot it. I have just been attacked by this lady... What is your name Why don't you want him to speak This is a national security case. This affair has changed the Brazilian history and I want to know why. You cannot attack me. Look here. That is what my hands are like after the aggression I have just suffered. from that lady, who in no way wanted... that Mr. Luis Perecin talked to us. As I had mentioned, the atmosphere is very tense... among the people who took part or are involved in this affair. Here it is. She attacked me and did not want me to leave the place. I don't know why. Another person we interviewed... and who also plays a very strange roll is... Renato, the one who found the knife. Renato, he himself admitted he participates in a network of military and ex-military people. And he said he was there... on the day of the event. But I didn't find, I could not find not even one photo with him... But he said he was there. And bear in mind that we examined about 3,000 photos. But we traced him, we got his address... We went there where he lives... a place in the outskirts of Juiz de Fora... And after we had insisted a lot he gave us an interview over the phone... And he said he was there as a security agent... of one of Bolsonaro's supporter, who at that time was a councilman in the municipality,... and today he is a federal deputy. He was elected a federal deputy. He is Charles Evangelista. According to the report of the police process... you are the one who found the knife. Yes, at that moment it was I who took the knife. And how did that happen? Can you tell me about it What happened? ...The terms of the testimony I gave was this:... I was working on the security team of PFL candidates... who were the police commissioner Sheila... and Charles Evangelista. One for state deputy and the other for federal. I was working on their escort when he arrived... We received him... We had some guidelines about the way he was going to arrive. How he was going to be arriving. He had a private security body. And we would be doing the escort... which is a normal campaign activity. I didn't see the moment of his detention, when he was arrested... by the military police, he was hand-cuffed, I was somewhere nearby... When I opened the way and could see that the military police had someone under arrest... I immediately saw the knife. I understand. I stepped on the knife... and I told myself: "when I have better conditions I will bend down and catch it." Because if I bent down at that moment I would be trodden up. Ok. When the people calmed down a little... he had already been corned in one of the shops nearby... and then I bent down and caught the knife. And if I had got the knife with all that movement,... A 1m84cm tall negro with a knife in his hand in all that turmoil, that would look strange. Do you agree? I would have a lot to explain. So what did I do As I was acquainted with the man at the fruit stand... and so I asked him to keep it for me until I returned to recover it. And while I said that... I would return to fetch it,... I called a friend of mine who is a military... a P2, who works in plain clothes,... I called him and said: Look I have the weapon of today's attack. So, stay there because I am going towards you. He came to me... and I asked him not to even mention me. It is here in our hands. We took a photograph. I took a photo with my cell-phone at that moment there... and I handed it to him and went away. I went after Charles Evangelista. Charles Evangelista said the following:... "I do not know this Renato." He is not my security agent... and I don't know this person. I don't know who he is. The police commissair Sheila was not even there on that day. I was there. I found the place full of his flags as a pre-candidate and as a Jair Bolsonaro's supporter... He was in PSL and was elected. Therefore, Renato needs being investigated seriously... because he is the key for this investigation... or what should be an investigation. What was he doing there Because the knife was find by him. Now, what can guarantee that that knife was really there At that place That knife was presented later. It is evidently reasonable to suppose... or to suspect... that that knife was falsely introduced on that day. And then a laboratorial checking was done. Adelio's finger prints were not found on the knife. His finger prints are not there. They said there were many finger prints and so it was not possible to identify which ones were Adelio's. At first, there was some false information... that it was a knife used... in the boarding house where he was... by everybody there in the kitchen. But later this information proved to be false... because that knife had been bought in Florian?polis, at least in the second version,... together with an identical knife and it was of Adelio's personal use... which Adelio had taken to that boarding house. And, as I had said, that knife was taken to the Federal Police... the inspection was done and the experts said they found... traces of Bolsonaro's DNA on that blade. On that knife. That is what connected him to the crime. As per the inspectors' report, that knife would have penetrated 15 cm inside Bolsonaro's belly. But here you can see that Adelio did not have the necessary standpoint to enable him to do something strong. This was told me by a surgical doctor... who was aware of our documentary... and anonymously communicated with me... In reality, I know her name, but she asked me not to mention it... And she said that he did not have a standpoint to allow him to cause that perforation... with that 15 cm depth. A big difficulty in this investigation was... trying to talk with the so-called voluntary security agents and... and with the one who organized all this apparatus, who was a federal police agent. Marcelo Bormevet. I managed to,... I tried many times... and I talked to his wife. Hello. Is that Dr. Eveline Yes. Dr. Eveline, good afternoon, I am looking for... I am looking for Mr. Marcelo Bormvet. I apologize for calling you... but I wanted to talk to him and I could only get your contact... Is it possible for me to talk to him Who's speaking It is Joaquim de Carvalho, I am a journalist. What is it about I am talking about the federal police operation carried out on September 6th, 2018, here... on the day of the knife stabbing. And I am trying to talk to him about his participation in that operation. Well, I know nothing about it. I will have to pass your contact over to him. Ok? We are here, at the house, or building, where Hugo used to live. who was the one who immobilized Adelio on that day... and took Adelio to a room in a building... in order to protect him from the crowd... who wanted to lynch him. Hugo ended up dying in February this year... of a heart attack. Let's try to talk to his widow... who still lives here in this apartment... in this condominium. Good evening, Adriana, please. Adriana, it is Joaquim de Carvalho who's speaking here... I am a journalist and I am preparing a documentary video... about that knife stabbing event... First of all, my condolences, as I got to know your husband died... and on that day he was acting as a voluntary security agent there... and I'd like to know if you could talk to me. I no longer want to talk about this. Then, why don't go and try to know why the commissioner who was in charge was removed... Why was the agent that was together with my husband transferred to Rio? These are some questions you could ask them over there. And, as I've already said, I'm not going to answer anything else if I do not have my lawyer by me. We managed to talk to this guy... called Corporal Cleines. I got to the point of exchanging messages with him. This corporal Cleines is terribly afraid... He says he has been abandoned and he fears he may be killed. That lawyer Wassef... Bolsonaro's lawyer,... tried to use him in order to incriminate the left, the PT (Workers' Party)... at that time. In a national network program in Bandeirantes TV ran by Lacombe,... he said he had a witness that would confirm this linking... That is false. Today, Cleines is extremely afraid of what may happen to him. He acted in that affair... and it was he the one who handcuffed Adelio, according to the report,... He handcuffed him, and those handcuffs were not police ones... Those handcuffs belonged to someone who owned a security company in a neighbour municipality... His name is Bosa. He also gave his witness at the federal police. We looked for him. But he doesn't talk. Here you have corporal Cleines who handcuffed him. He could unveil a lot of things. And from the talk I had with him, he must know a lot more... than what has already been revealed. Federal Justice Headquarters Juiz de Fora, MG I had access to part of the process of the stabbing, or the so-called stabbing,... Adelio Bispo de Oliveira was considered not imputable... by a request of his own lawyer. A psychiatric report defined him as paranoiac. Today, the defense is assumed by the Public Federal Defense Body... and Adelio's will, as in case he wants to make a denunciation, for instance,... depends on the decision of his curators. And who are his curators His ex-lawyers, those who took up the case... on behalf of a mysterious sponsor. - Did any church pay you for this job? - No. Just this person. I think he knows the family, he knows Adelio,... but it seems that the contact is connected with religion. The lawyers were vey quick in taking over the case... The lawyer went there by airplane. He is called Zanone... Before he got there,... there was already another of Zanone's associate in Belo Horizonte trying to take over the case He looked for Adelio and said: I've come here to be your lawyer on behalf of your mother Adelio answered: But my mother died in 1991. Then he said: Oh, no, it was your mother's sister. Adelio said: But I have no relationship at all with my mother's sister... But that was all intended to lock Adelio up. Adelio was locked up by these people. And who is this Zanone Zanone is a well-known lawyer in Belo Horizonte... but his cases, the notorious cases and people who he defends... indicate very well on what side he stands, what kind of clients... he ends up representing. One of them is the the principal of the assassination of the missionary woman... Dorothy Stang. In a cowardly action she was murdered because of what she defended... She was a human rights activist. And Zanone defends the principal in charge of this crime. Another one he defends is Bola,... that one who was condemned in the case involving the goalkeeper Bruno... the Flamengo's goalkeeper who killed Elisa Samudio. But we have to bear two things in mind. First, the strategy of defense he presents... instead of helping Adelio, it is much more useful to Bolsonaro. Because Adelio was considered not imputable. Paranoiac, not imputable. And Bolsonaro's family did not appeal this decision. Another thing to be considered: He himself... said Adelio was not imputable... on the very first day,... and asked for his inclusion in the LSN (National Security Law)... There is a trend, or, there are lawyers... who say this might be a case for a jury tribunal as a homicide attempt. But then everybody would see Adelio... Adelio would be interrogated... by other counterparts... This has not happened. And Zanone asks something else... that Adelio be taken to a maximum security prison... very far from Juiz de Fora. That is why he was sent to Campo Grande. Marco Antonio Mejia, Zanone's partner and one of those who acted in Adelio's name, in replying to our request for contact, considers "conspiracy theory" any different conclusion to this process. The Federal Police airplane that carried Adelio Bispo de Oliveira... took off early from Juiz de Fora airport. It landed in Campo Grande at 1h22 in the afternoon. Adelio went straight to the federal maximum security prison... He will occupy an individual cell like this one... with 7 square metres, in a wing for prisoners under Justice's protection. We are in Montes Claros, the capital of northern Minas Gerais. Adelio Bispo de Oliveira was born here. The city started its development from the horsemen's route... In the beginning of the present century, Adelio took the opposite way... and went southwards... but he never ceased having contacts... with his relatives, mainly with his brothers and nephews. We've come here exactly to look for these relatives... to know how they are living,... and what they think of the affair three years later. Adelio lived in this house since he was 10 years old... Before that, his family lived in a slum somewhere nearby... The house was built by his father in a plot of land donated by the municipality... The neighbours remember Adelio very well... He is described as a reserved person... and also for being evangelical. And he is also seen as an intelligent person... having the capability of explaining complex political situations... I also talked to his sister, who still lives in this house. Mrs. Lia, today, Adelio has asked you to change his lawyer Why didn't you change him because I am not capable of looking for a lawyer. I don't have the lawyer's phone. How can I look for him if I don't know his address or his telephone? But he did call you and you did have his phone... and you did ask to talk to him... but he didn't want to receive you. Was it so Yes, his answer was that he would reply as soon as he could. And, did he reply? Never. What did you want to know when you contacted him? Well, I wanted to know about Adelio's process... How the process was moving. But he never gave me an answer. Did you know that today he is Adelio's curator? No, this information didn't get to the family. Do you think this is correct? He has a family, you helped in his raising... A stranger becomes his curator... the owner of his will... No, that is not right. The lawyer's duty was to look for the family. And he didn't do it. What do you think of all this? Do you think the story has been told? No, there are lots of mistakes in this story. The lawyer doesn't even contact the family... He has not just one relative... He has various relatives here in Montes Claros. And he never looked for any. Therefore, it is the lawyer's fault. - You're talking about Zanone, right? - Yes. He knows Adelio has a family, and it is not just one relative. We are four brothers here. He didn't look for any of us. If he had looked for us, he would have got some answer. In reality, you don't even know if he's still alive. Right, I don't know this. How's he feeling... Don't you know? No, because they called me earlier... and told me that he had suffered a stroke. There, inside the cell. But they said that it was under control. He kept asked to be brought back or transferred to a nearer place... And the phone call he usually made, he always looked for me. And from the police station, he always telephoned me. And now he's not even doing this. I haven't received any call for a long time. - And, you don't know how he is... - No. I don't know, I don't have any information... As they usually say: I don't know if he's drinking or eating. And for you to go after him now, you're not financially fit for this. Is that the case? No, I have no conditions at all, because... I do my little selling business, I sell my little things, I am a peddler, earning my commission... So, it is as I say, what I earn is just enough for me to survive. Three years later, do you think Adelio really did that? Based on all you know about Adelio. Well, if he really did it, there is something wrong involved. Because I don't think he would do that by himself. He was a very clever, a very smart boy, he wouldn't do that. Because he would be doing something knowing he would die. He would kill, but would also die. So, I don't think he could do it alone at all. From what I know about him and the family, no. No, he wouldn't do it. There was a push from somebody. Do you suspect of anyone? There's no use saying I suspect of somebody. Because I don't know anybody out there. What do you mean? Because one doesn't know what the people who interacted with him are capable of. Because in the news report they always said they were together... He and his son, Adelio and the son of... So, this is the situation. The candidate's son? Yes, the candidate's son. That they were in the same place together, is it so? Yes, that is it. So, how can one say that they got very close... become friends... and return later to do that? But, was he a friend of the candidate's son? Well, at least they participated in those classes together. Nobody knows if they were friends. Well, this here is the shooting club called .38... The key to unveil this mystery is here. Adelio Bispo de Oliveira... took a shooting course here... on the days 3rd, 4th and 5th of July, 2018. He paid it down. He, who lived in a small 2x2 metres room without a bathroom... and had to use a communitarian bathroom. But, he came here and paid more than 600 reals... paid it in advance... and took a shooting course. He even has a certificate... as a shooter... On the last day of this course,... on the 5th of July, 2018,... he shared the same space, inside there,... with Carlos Bolsonaro. Carlos Bolsonaro came probably from Rio de Janeiro... and also did here,... exercised shooting... with an American instructor. Adelio was in the group and later, sat on a couch. They describe this. He was observing the people who were there in that place... And he returned home, he went back home,... which is about 3 km or 3.1 km from here. Then, he went back home, to this little 2x2 metres room... and then he carried on with his routine... as a worker. Two months later,... he was in Juiz de Fora... He was there for very few days... About 10 days... For you to have an idea of Adelio's difficult financial situation... he left the boarding house here in Florian?polis... in the district of Coqueiros... He left it without paying for the last days of his stay. Boarding house where Adelio lived in S?o Jos?, greater Florian?polis Marcos, I can see you are doing some work here... I don't know if you are a bricklayer... You're a bricklayer, right? Did you get to know Adelio, who lived there at no. 590 Yes, I did. How did you get to know him? While I was working there, because I live almost in front of that place. And did you also do any repair work there? Yes, I did it many times. - And, did you get to see him there, as a guest of the house? - Yes. And what was he like? He was very quiet, very reserved. As I had told you, he had this peculiarity of speaking to himself... I generally heard this while I was working there. - But, wasn't he an aggressive, violent person? - No. He was a very simple person... Do you think he matched the kind of people who take the courses... of shooting at Club .38, which is a place frequented by rich people? I believe that had nothing to do with him. He lived in a 2x2 room with a collective kitchen... A collective bathroom. A collective bathroom. A bathroom for 5 to 6 people. Adelio's room in the boarding house Adelio had some money in his account... 8,000 reals... The Federal Police concluded that that money... was the result... of a legal work action... This legal work action is related to the service done by Adelio in the seaside Camburi? city... It was an entrepreneurship between two companies... F.J.A. and Grey Enterprise... in the course of this process, after we had initiated this legal work action,... one of the companies did indeed offer him... an agreement proposition... they made a deposit of 6,000 reals, with the deduction of the lawyer?s fees,... an so he received the net value which was informed. So, he received 4,200 reals... in June 2017. The Federal Police said that he still had this money in September 2018... He still had this money in his account. And he received the FGTS funds, about 2,000 reals, something about that,... But Adelio needed to eat, he needed a place to sleep,... He lived in a boarding house, how did he manage to pay for all this Adelio left a clue... He himself published in his Facebook page... His check-in at the .38 Club, something he didn't usually do. But that time, he did it. He left a record of his staying at .38 Club. At that time, the spokeswoman of .38 Club,... he lied in a national broadcast network... She said Adelio had been there for just one single day... at .38 Club... to handle his enrollment... and that he had not at any moment met... with Carlos Bolsonaro. He arrived here, filled in a registration record... was accompanied by someone after having completed the registration... just like every citizen who comes here... and he was accompanied by an instructor for the training of shooting... who remained by his side all the time. Two of Bolsonaro's sons, Carlos and Eduardo Bolsonaro... have been associated members of this same club for 3 years. Although they frequent the club a lot... they were not in that place on the same day Adelio was there. Today, it is already known that that was a lie. Because the owners... were later called for testimony by the Federal Police... and then as witnesses they could not lie. And then they said that, yes,... on the 5th of June 2018... Adelio and Carlos Bolsonaro shared the same space... at .38 Club. And I went inside it. And .38 has a very strong identification with Carlos Bolsonaro. At the very entrance, on the left,... there are three frames... and the frames contain propositions which were approved... by Carlos Bolsonaro at Rio de Janeiro's municipal assembly... as well as a very important commemorative medal awarded by the the legislature... of Rio de Janeiro, the award named Pedro Ernesto. Carlos Bolsonaro, the author of these motions as well as of the awarding of the medal,... he is a regular frequenter of this place. As I had said, he was here with Adelio,... but he has been here several other times. And this Julia Zanatta... is today very intimate of the Bolsonaro family. For one to have an idea... on the preparatory events for the 7h of September celebration... she was in Brasilia, and was even together with Bolsonaro in his live video... on the 2nd of September. And after having lied in the national network programs of Globo TV,... Jornal Nacional (National News), interviews for SBT,... the main news program of SBT, the Record TV news,... she said that Adelio had not met... with Carlos. And she even minimized the matter... She said he had gone there only once for the filling of a data file But he stayed there for three days. He paid the course down and stayed for three days. And later, she travelled together with Eduardo Bolsonaro... to Virginia, where they met... with Olavo de Carvalho. But, she ended up becoming the regional director... of EMBRATUR in the south of the country. And, please remember:... EMBRATUR was under the umbrella... of Marcelo ?lvaro Antonio... federal deputy and later became minister... At that time he was a minister... And he remained in office with the explicit support... of Carlos Bolsonaro,... in spite of very serious denunciations for the malversation of employees... And Julia was there. She became a director in that ministry. Furthermore, in 2020 she ran for the position of mayor of Crici?ma City... She was not elected,... but there is a recorded declaration... of both Jair Bolsonaro and Eduardo Bolsonaro in her support. It is one more evidence that contains... Let's call it this way, the shadows of suspicion. Let's call it this way,... The shadows of suspicion... over Carlos Bolsonaro. Publications in the .38 Club's Facebook page Publication on the very same day of the so-called stabbing It is just one more task mission, captain! And the security agents, pay attention, the security agents... Bolsonaro's security agents... including the voluntary ones... they were either condecorated or promoted... But, anyone specialized in security matters... would say that there was a gigantic security failure on that day. It is necessary to point out, it is necessary to remark,... that some key people... were transferred to ABIN, which is the Intelligence Office. And it is under General Heleno's umbrella. Do you remember that General Heleno... when in an interview Lula questioned... the stabbing event... General Heleno lost his temper... This is a joke against our society... a dishonest president of the republic... destroys the reputation of the country... It is an absurd for him to dare raise the hypothesis of the stabbing... as a false event. Was his cancer false? And was Mrs. Dilma's cancer false? Has anyone asked him about this? Did anyone have the courage to say this to him? This is typical of a rascal. It is typical of this guy. Typical of this guy. The Minister of The Institutional Office. And it was him, it is there in his ministry... ABIN, whose director is Ramagem. At the time, the media said he enjoyed the confidence of the family... But the story is not really like this. The one who was of Carlos Bolsonaro's confidence... is Marcelo Bormevet. He was an agent and he organized the security scheme... there in Juiz de Fora. There is another ABIN agent... who worked together with Marcelo in this organization... They were from Juiz de Fora... And they were transferred to ABIN after Ramagem... was designated... And it is interesting that Ramagem's designation takes place... after General Santos Cruz is dismissed. General Santos Cruz was publicly burnt by Carlos Bolsonaro. Just like Bebianno had been some months earlier. Bebianno said in interviews... that, in more than one occasion,... that Carlos Bolsonaro wanted to set up a parallel ABIN... We had talked about the Hate Office, but also about a frustrated attempt... to create a kind of parallel ABIN... I would like you to tell us about this matter in a concise way... How it was carried out and how it served to wear out both you and General Santos Cruz... Regarding the Hate Office,... it was this, and we started alerting the president... We told him: the fabrication of these false news... nothing of this kind can be inside the palace... This may end up in an impeachment... You are so afraid of the impeachment... Are you going to allow this to be installed here? But the pressure exerted by Carlos Bolsonaro... is so strong that the president cannot resist his son... He cannot resist. It is like that child... that wants a present in the shopping centre. He doesn't get and then starts rolling around the floor with his legs in the air. And the father is not tough enough to put an end to that... This is more or less what happens... (Why?) On a certain day, Carlos came to me with the name of a federal commissioner and of three agents... who would be a parallel ABIN, because he did not trust ABIN... General Heleno was called... He was worried about that. But General Heleno is not a man of confrontation... and the matter came to an end there, with General Santos Cruz and me... We advised the president not to do that in any way... Because, even worse than the Hate Office, that would also be a reason for the impeachment. Well, I left later and I don't know if that was installed or not. In reality, it was not a parallel ABIN. It was about designating people of his confidence. Who were the people of his confidence One of them was Marcelo Bormevet. Ramagem, after Santos Cruz left,... Ramagem is indicated... to the Senate, because one has to go through the Senate to be ABIN's director... He is indicated to the Senate. And after his name was approved... he then designates Bormevet to be the chief of one of the departments... And the other policeman, Felipe,... becomes his deputy in the general directorate... And two other agents... were designated for positions abroad... They were there... They failed... In the hypothesis that there was a knife stabbing... And they were promoted... One is in Florida... The other is in Portugal... Two at ABIN, two abroad... This must all be investigated... because, perhaps Brazil, in this Bolsonaro government, is the only one in the world... that rewards the security agents for their failure... Because, if the security agents on that day protected someone, this one was Adelio... from the rage of Jair Bolsonaro's supporters. The public had a fundamental role in the confection of this documentary video... Some in financing and many in supplying information... One person deserves a special remark... He is Fabio Morato. He decided to research Adelio's Facebook page... He made a lot of prints... And then he went to his sports academy... When he came back... the page had been removed from the air... Motivated by your live video and by your saying that you would make... a documentary about the stabbing event with Adelio Bispo... I decided to enter into Adelio's Facebook page... just for curiosity... and I went on researching and I started checking from his most recent postages... up to the oldest ones. While I was doing this... I was getting page prints... of various of his postages... I did that for about an hour or an hour and a half... Then I left his Facebook page and went to a sports academy nearby for some training... When I returned from the academy, an hour or an hour and a half later... I entered into Facebook again... but I was surprised with the fact that his account had been deactivated... This is the matter, this is the question: Who removed it Who is administering, or who was administering Adelio's page He's in a maximum security prison... I made another print showing Adelio's initial page in blank... as a certification that it had been deactivated. His nephew... was traced and he gave us an interview... and he said that Adelio's profile... was altered... after his imprisonment. When the incident took place I entered my uncle's Facebook and he was online... and if my memory is not failing I was his friend in Facebook... I decided to check our friendship... and it was no longer effective. The inquiry mentions information about Facebook... stating that the latest actualization happened before the stabbing event in Juiz de Fora. This is the information that appears in Facebook. However, now we have two people informing that... there were changes. When I did this checking I analyzed this period... of that year 2018... and what drew my attention was... his check-in in the .38 Club... That was something that had been previously published by the media... But I went on comparing with earlier years and the impression I had... is that he did not use to proceed likewise with Facebook registry in the past... There is no investigation about Bolsonaro's case. It should be investigated. Adelio is not even heard. He had to be investigated. Because, as I had said, what is the probability that Carlos Bolsonaro... and Adelio were in the same place two months earlier?... And after this fact... Adelio changes his militancy in the social nets and begins to attack Bolsonaro... Therefore, you may suspect that... from then onwards, they started developing a plot for Bolsonaro's stabbing... to include this fact in the narrative of a left wing militant who attacked Bolsonaro... Therefore, because of this... I had this impression... Who was operating Adelio's account And from what we know, I imagined... they can be professional of the social networks. And what do we see nowadays in Brazil? Social networks professionals... associated to what? They're linked to fake news and also the Hate Office. That is why I wanted to draw a parallel between... Adelio's Facebook account and Carlos Bolsonaro's Facebook account... I was able to trace an old postage in Carlos Bolsonaro's account... in which he comments on an attempt supposedly suffered by president Trump... a few days before his first election in the United States... which took place in 2016. It happened in November 2016. I found in Carlos Bolsonaro's Facebook a postage of November 2016... The date was 6th November 2016... And these here are his words... Deadly silence of the media in relation to the possible attempt against Trump's life. Would they act likewise with Hillary! Let's all be prepared! All of it with exclamation! That did not tally that narrative... And he then starts attacking Bolsonaro... which is what he did not do in the previous postages... He starts attacking Bolsonaro. And then you notice that there is a linking really between... the behavior of what we could call the left and that of Adelio's. Adelio then takes up a position like a more combative militant. And this hypothesis has been ignored. This meeting is suspicious. Look, I don't believe he was in opposition to Bolsonaro in no way... Because, the only point in which I think he might be against... is in relation to the financial rentability... Because, unfortunately, we had lots of unemployment... We had lots of problems because of this... But, regarding the whole ideology, they are very similar... Well, in addition, I saw in his Facebook page... he even defends that the military should administer clubs to look after adolescents... together with religious people. Therefore, one cannot say that Adelio was a leftwinger as it had been spread at the time... No, no, in terms of ideology that makes no sense to me. Do you understand? This of his being of the left, because... The only thing which could link him to the left is that he is poor. And, whether we like it or not, at PT's time... the poor had more social value. But, unfortunately, nowadays we tend not to consider this. No matter how much we say that the inflation has risen... that salaries have risen and so forth... For the poor's working day nowadays, the price of meat is higher. In the past it was not like this. So, this ideology he used to defend. Now, in terms of human rights,... minors' criminality, in all those other ideologies he agreed... The same thinking as Bolsonaro's, is it? Yes. The curious thing is that people emphasized and reinforced his militancy and affiliation to PSOL... And they never mentioned that he had been affiliated to PSD... His last political party was Kassab's PSD... Within the inquiry there is a letter from him to the Electoral Justice... of Uberaba in which he asks his disaffiliation from PSD... This was never talked about. Because the whole media bought the narrative... that was produced. That Adelio was a leftwing mentally disturbed militant... and that he acted alone. At least this is what the whole media bought in general. He acted alone, he was a lonely wolf. Who gave you the order for this Nobody. This is not what you had said before. Who ordered you to do that? I didn't say that somebody ordered. The one who ordered was God above there. And then there appears a photo of Adelio... participating in a manifestation in protest against Temer... That manifestation took place after Bolsonaro himself had declared... that the solution for the country was Temer's renunciation. That's what he was saying at that time. And then there came that manifestation in Florian?polis. And the one who is beside him is a rightwing militant. And later, that is very recently, about a year ago,... he gave an interview... to live broadcasts in Bolsonarist channels... to invent that Adelio had commented... about his connection with Jean Wyllis. Some big fake news. This guy was called... and then he said: Oh, no, I was misunderstood, it was not what I meant... He made a rectification. However, the political fact occurred... always associating the stabbing event... with the opposition to Bolsonaro, with the left. In a postage in a social network on August 1st,... Adelio wrote that Bolsonaro was nasty... when he commented on a video in which the politician defended the military regime. In other images, he appears in a protest against Michel Temer. The suspect also published a photo in which two youngsters are wearing T-shirts in support of Lula. That was not all. Also Adelio's lawyer... Adelio's lawyer asks... the judge to have as Adelio's defense witnesses the declarations of... Lula, Maria do Ros?rio and Jean Wyllis. The judge does not agree. But that served to generate media headlines. For the people in general, that is an indication... People comment: You see... Lula will be Adelio's defense witness. Therefore, the lawyer operated as someone working to service Bolsonaro... That was very clear. The first visit I made to him at Einstein's Hospital... I remember that he whispered to Gustavo and me in the room... and said: "Now, we don't need to do anything else." "We just have to wait because the election has been won." Brazil never needed a campaign so much as that time. Why Because Bolsonaro was growing... based on fake news spreading... And fake news... could be dismantled, would be dismantled... in the debates. I feel that clearly. The stabbing event put an end to this possibility. In reality, that guaranteed the victory to Jair Bolsonaro. Then the whole campaign entered in that stage... which was very much in accordance to Trump?s strategist... Steve Bannon... A campaign is like a war... in which you have to affect the emotion and... establish that you are fighting oppressive forces... which are very powerful. This is Steve Bannon's strategy. It is curious that Bannon... one or two weeks earlier, in the month of August,... he was with Eduardo Bolsonaro... Eduardo Bolsonaro published in his twitter about their meeting... with photos... and, according to Eduardo Bolsonaro himself,... in this first meeting Bannon said... that Jair Bolsonaro was going to suffer an attack. That was all a strategist like Bannon could want. In one of the cities, I think it was Ara?atuba, I was in the car with him,... with that crowd around and so, I always asked him to wear a bullet-proof jacket,... Sometimes, in spite of the hot weather, he was wearing long sleeves because of the jacket,... Then, on our return, we got into the car,... he looked at me, I said: "You've got to be careful, too many people"... "It is a matter of security". He answered: "If I suffered a knife stabbing I would win the election". He used this sentence about 10 or 15 days before the event. And then, Bolsonaro's supporters started spreading this same version the following day... Already by midnight, saying that Bolsonaro was a soldier wounded at war. As a soldier wounded at war. (OUR SOLDIER) That became the theme of his campaign. With drone images as well... made by Eduardo Bolsonaro..., who immediately started preparing those drone images. As if everything had been prepared in advance, and the T-shirt with that fake logo... with a hole or a tear that was false... and with blood, although there had been no blood... But, let's open a parenthesis,... It is possible to have a bloodless stabbing, just with internal hemorrhage... The doctors admit this... However,... they decided to show to the general public a T-shirt full of blood... with a hole. And bear in mind that Bolsonaro's T-shirt on that day has never been found. It disappeared. It disappeared. It got lost. "A soldier that goes to war and is afraid of dying is a coward." There's still a lot to be explained... I think the Brazilian history needs an independent investigation. All of that was dealt with the connivance... even of the local authorities there... in Minas Gerais. Everything was directed in a way that the case... so that for the Federal Police Adelio would be immediately taken away from that scene... and could then be isolated far away in a maximum security prison. Some people say: "Ah, there he is safer, he has medical attention'. That's a lie. If it is a matter of health... he ought to be treated in a psychiatric hospital. But, then, Adelio would be out of control, he would have access to other people... Could talk to other doctors,... But it is really necessary that we try to... find out if this was not all pre-planned. The way the story was told, many aspects are not plausible... It is not coherent in many points. And, based on my experience,... in the coverage of other cases,... police and political cases,... with those two confluences,... the Federal Police disdained the evidences, they did not investigate... the self-aggression hypothesis, although there are many clues in this direction... And those clues are very strong... And they should have been investigated. The story died the way it was born. Adelio is a leftwing militant... who acted on his own, injured Bolsonaro and attempted against Bolsonaro's life. Now, in every crime, one always starts from... a question, so that one can find the effective answer... Who would benefit from this crime? When one has a crime, one has to start from this hypothesis... Who benefits from this crime Who would be interested in it The answer about who could be interested in it... the answer is obvious... Jair Bolsonaro. It was not in the interest of the opposition, rather on the contrary.. It was not in the interest of anybody outside the group of interests... around the campaign of Jair Bolsonaro. In this case, if this really occurred... it was a very well planned action... and very efficient. But there's never a perfect crime... It is possible and it is necessary to identify... and verify what is behind this affair,.. and who the real criminals are. The main victim we all already know:... It was Brazil, with the election of Jair Bolsonaro... We are the main victims of what happened there in Juiz de Fora. Because, in normal conditions, without this stabbing event, or fake stabbing event,... Bolsonaro would never be elected president of the Republic.
