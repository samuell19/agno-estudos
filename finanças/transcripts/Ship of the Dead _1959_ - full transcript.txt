SHIP OF THE DEAD Hey you! - Yeah? Tell me: do I get it right or is a ship laying here? No no, nothing here. The Borgese left already at night. Such a mess! it was supposed to leave at 7 a.m. Didn't the nice lady wait for the gentleman? They do that sometimes. Damned! It's just 6 a.m. and the tub is gone. At first the Dane should have been loaded, then they favoured the Italian. You can't rely on them. - Rely! Rely! They left me stale here. A left over sailor surely is a sad sight. They are guzzling my scrambled eggs right now. There are some other ships out there... Where you want to go? - No matter! I want a good ship. Looking for a ship? - Yes! OK, we got one here bound to Philadelphia. That's marvelous! I wasn't at home for a long time. I'm from New Orleans. Name? - Sailor Gale! Your sailing certificate? - How much pay? One shilling six pence per hour for guarding duty. OK. All my money... The documents are also gone. - Maybe you left it behind. That's too much! I'll be right back! Yes. ...we are sorry, but without valid papers... Yes. ...without valid papers we can't ship the goods. Etc... -Yes. I just can imagine... Nothing found, right? I even Didn't find the house. They all look the same at night. Never mind... I will get a new one over there. Sure, but first you have to get there. Without certificate it's not possible with my ship. He doesn't know you. Sailors are telling lots of tales. I'm afraid you'll get into big trouble. If I were you, I'd dig over the whole town for that book. Without papers, you are a dead man! You'll be surprised how alive I am... Even without them! For the KapitÃ¤n DeMerle to Panama, San Diego, Los Angeles... and Seattle! A machine operator! - That's me! OK. - Be on board at 5 p.m.! A stoker! Nobody? That's all for now. We'll be continuing in half an hour. - Thanks! Hello Sir! I thought about the stoker. Why Didn't you say it inside? Up to now I've been a deckhand. But one should do a bit of everything. That's very reasonable. Just register on board right now. Thanks Sir. In Los Angeles I can get me a new certificate as well. Sorry, I lost it. - Well, you got no certificate... No, no... - There's nothing I can do. The Kapitän DeMerle is a neat kind of ship. No felonies here! Any vacancies, Sir? Ever worked in a caboose? Sure thing. You won't find anyone better! Got your papers? - Of course, Sir! OK, get in. Hurry up and get back on land, damned bastard! What's the matter? I Didn't say I got my papers with me. You got no papers? What do you think about that? Very odd, right? Hey, what's your nationality? - Chinese! Hey, hold on... Hello! You will get it right now. I'll send you picture of myself. If that will help. But now I'm hungry. OK... Sit down! Take my apple. What shall we do with you? Let me go, Inspector! - Letting go? Do you got your certificate, your passport? You got nothing! We take a walk to my consul. I thought about that. But if he will kick you out immediately? My consul is supposed to kick me out? At first you have to prove to him that he is YOUR consul, right? If you can't prove it, he will transfer you to us officially. Know what that means? What does it? Anybody who will be caught without a passport will get 6 months in jail and will be deported to his homeland. Your homeland is being denied, so we won't get rid of you. So weÂ´d have to feed you until your final days. We can't just beat you to death like a dog. Yeah... that would make things much easier. You're are funny bird. Too bad we can't use you at all. Well, I may leave then... - Yes, you may. So if you are free and left the whole affair behind you, you can see your consul, too. Well then... Gentlemen! I just said if you are FREE. You just have to stay here until this evening. Why until the evening? - Because it will be dark by then. We have a special plan, and you can't do that in broad daylight. What did you conceive here? Maybe you dug out a law that allows people without papers to get drowned... Nobody would miss me. - You're right, good idea! Well, we just reached the frontier. - Frontier? What for? - To get you over there. But I don't got a passport. If you'd got one, you could stay here as well. I won't go! I don't even think about it. You're walking straight ahead. You'd not meet an officer there. After an hour you'll reach a railroad line and a station. Around 4:00 a.m. you'll join the workers there and get yourself a ticket. Yeah, but... - Here... ...is some money. And some food as well. Hurry up, and never get caught here again. Well! Damned! I'll brake my neck around here. Shut up! The frontier is over there. I don't care. - Hurry up! The consul is awaiting you. Hello! Please... I'm sorry to keep you waiting. The Borgese Didn't answer immediately. Well, the information is very bad. You are not listed as a member of the crew. Of course I'm not on it. That would not be possible. It was planned to hire me in New Orleans, the list was already closed and they wanted to register at the next harbor. Well...that might be possible. But... they acknowledged that I was on board, right? They also acknowledged that you left the ship without permission. They refuse to be responsible for you. How could I know that they would left 2 hours earlier? So how did you get from Antwerp Rotterdam, honestly? Just as I told you, the police brought me at night... - I can't imagine that. That's impossible: They won't bring a man into a strange country in this way. Without any papers. Your shipping certificate was issued Boston? Yeah... I think it was Boston. Such a long time ago. Did you have a registered domicile? Yes... I was in San Diego for a year as a child. And then... in Houston, but just a short time before I moved. Where have you been born? Well... that should supposed to be registered. But that doesn't proof you are the one. 5 minutes later and you'll convince me I haven't been born at all. Give my secretary your exact data, names and addresses of acquaintances, whatever you got. Over there they will try to identify you. Which will be not too easy due to your sparse information. And most of all, it will take some time. It will take at least 2 months. What? 2 months? Well, I... What should I do now without any money? You should have been more careful with your papers. You must not loose them. Can't you... get me a passport meanwhile... - Unfortunately I can not do that. But I will give an order that you can stay at a sailor's hostel and get food there. Thanks a lot. That's very friendly... I said my name is Gale; and he said: "How will you prove it, got a passport?" For everything I said he's got an answer to make me silent. All of a sudden, he gave me money for food. Suddenly human again. Well buddy, starving is human, having no papers is not human. One Shilling and 10 pence! I'm supposed to wait for 2 months. He can imagine that! If he says 2, it could be 6 as well. - I won't take that! Shall I beg or call the Salvation Army? If the Police will catch me, they'll send me back to the frontier. I'm not nuts! Something will come to my mind for sure. - There's just one chance: go South! Small harbor. There are ships around. They sail for countries you don't even know. They won't ask anything. Moreover it's a warm climate, which is good if you don't have money. Right. Let's go South! But how will I get there. Frontiers again! They are loading right there. They will get there straight away. OK. I'll do it. We'll go here, you wanna get there... Thanks, has been a good ride. Just a hint: you're American, so if they catch you along the way, you tell them that you just visited your father's grave. You understand? They all love if a hero dies for them! Tell me: will there ever be a train on this line? I'm walking on these rails for 2 hours. Where you wanna go? To the shore. There are just 2 trains running, to and fro. Yours will run tomorrow. Barefoot... good idea! You're looking tired. Yes... tired... ...and dirty. When did you take a bath recently? Well... A long time ago. I almost forgot how a bed looks like, too. What are you doing here anyways? Well...I... you know...my father died here and I searched for the grave. I'm American, you understand? Well, today you can't get any further. Nope. It's very easy: you just drive tomorrow in the morning. And tonight, you'll sleep at my place. Yeah, gladly! Gladly! My mother will provide dinner for us. We live together. What's the matter? I'm a sailor after all! - So start swimming! I'm doing it... Gale! Did you come out? No, still in! - Dinner will be ready in 2 minutes! Yeah. I'm coming! We could have made something else. What else? - You don't even know him. That's right. He don't knows anything, because he is a stranger here. Besides, I rarely have any guests. - You're too blue eyed. Anyways, just don't talk about it. Right! - You're dressed already! Hopefully you spend more time to wash yourself. Here: just take a look! Aah... it's twinkling! This is your seat. - Thanks. Do you like roasted rabbit? - Sure thing! I shot it! You, Mylene? - Yeah. Goddammit! Yes. I used father's rifle. He will be proud. Unfortunately, he won't notice it all too soon. No? They put him into jail for 42 days. What do you think about that? M..mean. That's really mean! Did he... - Some bread? ...killed somebody? - Yes, even more than one! Oh! - He was poaching, again and again. I see! - He just liked it, and it's much cheaper, too. - Sure! That's very reasonable. Everybody does it around here. - Yes? Too bad I can't stay any longer. I'd have loved helping you. No thanks. I can manage it myself. Mother! Where are you? hey, come on hurry up! Help us to get rid of that roast. Did you got any boyfriend? - Yes. And? - We wanted to get married. But his parents were against it. - Why? They are very rich. And so they talked him into that it won't be any good. And he listened to that? Yeah... He's engaged now. But he won't get lucky. There are some advantages if you got no family, you can do any nonsense you like. What about you? are you able to count all your girls? I can't remember anyone. No, I do remember one... She stole all my money and my certificate. I'll remember her for the rest of my life. You know. girls like you... are of no use for sailors. before you say "Yes", the ship will be in another harbor. Is it important to say "Yes"? - Of course it is. Why? We are talking about it while at sea all the time. Looking forward to it. But as it happens there seems to be something missing. The most important thing. Yes. Well, this is the most beautiful harbor where my ship ever stayed! A harbor without water. It's a harbor despite that. Will your ship ever return here? No! I won't come back. 2 or 3 kids would be crawling around your legs, which would look neatly, but it won't bring me any joy, because they would be someone else kids. It doesn't have to be like this. No, it has to be like this! That's the right way. When do you have to get back to your ship? Without me, they are just helpless. The ship might as well explode without me. Where will it go? To New Orleans. I'll drive along the shore, then I'll get me a new certificate, and Then I'll be a human again. Otherwise, I'm not. Do you understand? You are talking very gently. You don't believe? You don't know nothing! Will your ship explode if you are late for just one day? It's very hard already... Come on... I have to lock up. Will you turn on the lights? See! I'm doing all that by myself. 2 trains per day: one at 8:05 a.m., the other at 12:00 a.m. Shall I teach you? It's very easy! You could be my substitute... If I have to go to the village. To do the shopping. Mylene! Yes mother. Its just us. You are sleeping in my room. I prepared everything... and I will stay with Mother. I'll wake you. I'll bring breakfast, too. Hello! They did ring for the first time! I have to go back. I have to be there when the train passes by. Can't you manage that the train stops here? No! You'll pass by at my place according to the timetable. According to the timetable... Maybe I'll come back some day. - Yes. Maybe you'll return. Mylene! I'm coming! Adieu Sailor! Mylene! No, my dear... thanks for the offer... but you are too modest for me. Get lost and greet your girlfriend! Are you fishing for oiled sardines in strange waters? No...for whales! I see. Can you make a living with that? Well... it's not that important to me. I still have farms and a winery left. And my bank account, of course! That's obvious! Sailor, right? From the most elegant ship worldwide. That's obvious! What's you job? Machine! Trimmer! One of those ... I was offered double wages at Frisco if I'd went to the boiler. Not my cup of tea! You're a sailor? I'd never guessed that. That was a long time ago. I did have my papers then. Without papers! Oh well... you might get stuck at the best harbor with that. I just noticed that. I'd really like to know why we were not born with a brand on the butt. No bad idea! If anybody asks you about your passport, you just let your knickers down. Lawski! The sea is calling... Oh well... best regards! Get it down there! - Yeah, I will. Mr. Dils! Guess about his profession! - Who? Fisherman! - Wrong. Sailor! Got no papers. Such a bad world, right? He won't get him. I know that kind. Cigarette? Am I supposed to sing a song or recite some poem? Nope, but I heard you are a sailor. All those things people are talking about... Are you a deckhand by chance? Bad luck, mister. Machine! That's just what I'm looking for! My name is Dils. I'm 2nd officer on the Yorikke which is laying over there. Good position? There are only good positions! - Yeah... your staff is looking just like that! We encountered a typhoon. - Oh! Listen: I'll give you a chance. You'll never will get away from here. Look around: nothing is going on around here. Where will the ship go? Well... we've got really big cargo. Where do you wanna go? Boston! - Gee, you are lucky! We've got some freight for Boston. So let's go! Don't hurry! What's the pay? - English money. How is the food? - Plenty! Boston would be nice. A man like you belongs to the sea. Your hair will turn Grey until you'll get such a chance again. It would suit me very well, because I lost a man. It has to be considered very well. - You won't regret it. OK then... That fox really got him. This is for you as a gift... get lost! Get the ladder... What a funny bird... Shut up over there! Looks like I'm on the wrong ship, mister! - Boatswain! Provide some discipline! And you'll go to your cabin. - Show him the accommodation! Both legs are on deck, too late to go back. Good recommendation. I thought that guy would be more troublesome. Prepare the anchor! "Who enters here his name and soul have vanished gone forever? " Which bunk is still left? The box down there. - Which one? That one! - Go on and take a nap, mate! Where are some mattresses? - Won't be delivered. Cushions? - Nope. Blankets? - Won't be delivered! Looks like the only thing that will be delivered is the ship. Or do I also have to bring that along? Did you bring along a smoking? I think I will get back on land. You won't get away from here. It's more likely that you will end up in chains. If that is not enough, the boss will take you to the gallows. All for the benefit of the Yorikke... That was the way he got you, right? - In some way, yes. There comes that hog! What did they pay you to get me? We'll talk about it before I'll leave in Boston. Boston? Why do you think of Boston? Hey newbie! The captain wants to talk to you! Enjoy it. So you are the new trimmer! Trimmer? No Sir, I'm a stoker. What's happening? I Didn't say anything about a stoker. I ask him about being a deckhand . And he said "Machine". Is that right? Yeah, that's...thatÂ´s right. But I never thought of being a trimmer, the hardest and lousiest work ever. I thought that would be OK. Besides, I want to leave at once Captain! I don't even think about working as a trimmer, I'm protesting and will do a complaint at the Bureau of Sea. Dils, I don't want to be involved in this! I'm not responsible for that. You'll have to handle this yourself. The trimmer belongs to the machine, doesn't he? Actually, he does. But... You should have stated explicitly that you were talking about a stoker. Mr. Dils would have told you then we won't need a stoker. OK... I'm quitting at the next harbor. You can't do that. - Of course I can. You applied for Boston. That's the next harbor, right? - No! We were bound for Greece, but changed my mind. Now it's northern Africa. You told me Boston would be the next harbor. I'd swear to that! I Didn't say that at all. I said that we got cargo for Boston and you could quit there. Did you mention any deadline? Not at all, Captain. I can't do that. I won't work on this ship. Not for a single grain! - Don't shout like that. So what's happening, Dils? I'm just sick of it. Did you hire this man or Didn't you? This man was hired by me, Captain. He wasn't told just one single word that won't be true. If you refuse to work, this will turn out to be mutiny. I would think about that VERY well. You're looking real smart... Let's leave it this way. I'm not a fiend. Come on... Name? Pippip! Is that your last name? First and last name. See! Well... will I be put into chains? So you won't have to work, right? No way, buddy! That will cost you 2 months pay. Dirty hog! Start the guard duty at 12! - OK Sir! Here it is! Now you get it and bring it over there to pour it out. Damned filth! Lawski! - YES! I have to go down again. Do it on your own. OK? Here is the wind up and this is the break, but take care that the whole thing won't hurtle down! It's not that easy. it will take some time until you'll get the knack. Won't you come? Yeah! The new one doesn't know about the wind up, Martin! How many of these scumbags can you do per hour? Just about 50. Don't worth mentioning. I have to go down, you saw how it's done. If you break the wind up, you have to do it manually. You'd enjoy THAT! Start it! It's 7! Get down for duty! Come on! Just follow that smell, you can't take the wrong way. Welcome to hell! Hey hey hey! You need a nurse, right? I realized that right from the start: Nurse Lawski! What I'm supposed to do with a weakling? He'll collapse even before he started. WHO is collapsing? The little one got a big mouth! Calling someone a weakling always works, right? So get your bones together... Why just standing there? What's your name anyways? Pippip! So you are Persian? - No. Abyssinian. My mother was Persian. Mine was an old bitch. But if you say one word about it, I'll punch your face! Clear that tub! Soon you'll understand why another man was needed here. You can't handle it alone. Take care. I'll get to sleep. Wait a minute! Look away! Dirty hell! Come on, Pippip! Shuffle the coals! What's happening? I'm here, all right! Camels and donkeys will lay down if they are finished. But humans can be tortured. Because he can think. Because he is hoping. The sailor's life is just a joy! Well, do you still got all your bones? Closing time for me! Get up, buddy! - I just said it's closing time! Attention: keep the steam! Let those damned boilers burn out! Hey WEAKLING! Where does it hurt, little one? You call yourself a stoker? What can you expect from a son of a bitch? Say that again! Son of a bitch! SON OF A BITCH! What did you say? What's happening? Keep the steam! You... come on, you... torturer! I would have killed him. Too bad! Shoved him into the fire. Nobody would have known where he went. Nice day, right Boatswain? Sure thing, Captain! You surely are happy to do your duty on the Yorikke, right? - Yes. Everybody should be happy. What would lay ahead ashore for all these people? What do you think, boatswain? - I don't know, Sir. For some it would even be the gallows. I'm totally sure about you. I'm very thankful for that. - The other ones are being thankful, too? Or are there people who don't comprehend what I am doing for them? They don't think a lot, Skipper! They are too tired. No reason to get worried. OK, boatswain. Speed them up a little! - OK sir! Morning! You should dress a little more serious, being the 1st officer. Stop playing the boss! Hurry up, you lazybones! What's happening? Just start working! You're not here for laying in the sun! You ruin your health! Don't loose your self control! Yeah... you'd need some ointment. And some sticking plaster. I'll visit the cook. maybe he'll got some ointment left. Stop it! I'll do you that favour, Martin. Are there no... I mean some pills or something like that? I take my medicine every day. All that coal dust will help for sure... - SILENCE! Get to sleep, damned bastards! I once knew an Indonesian girl. She got a skin... ...just like creamy coffee, you know. Do you also think about girls sometimes? I mean, as you are awake. I... I sometimes think about... (inaudible) SHUT UP! The boss wins. Sure thing. The captain always wins. Damned! The captain won't win if we don't want it! Are we just cattle? Is there no law anymore? Do you want to be used as fuel? - That's enough! I want to sleep. SLEEP! Did you hear me? You bastard! Control yourself! - I'll kill you! Monkey cage! Next time, I'll beat you up! Morons! Bastards! I don't understand at all. At first you mess around with me then... On the first 3 days you think that you are not able st stand it, then you get used to the pains. You'll be longing for the good old Yorikke some day... What's the matter with this ruined tub? It's a tub for corpses! Yeah. Touch that lifebelt... Carefully... Yeah! You should also take a closer look at those boats. Are there any life jackets? Two for the whole staff. The boatswain got them. How could the bastard do this? There has to be one jacket per boat. Yeah... if there are no jackets, there won't be any witnesses at the court. Don't talk any nonsense. The captain wants to get off, too. Don't worry about the captain. He will manage to leave. Me too! And me! I'm really hungry! That chow and the coffee are just filth. Hey, Pippip! There is something I know about. It's just a fair moment... Come on... We're really stupid. Up there, we are slowly starving, and here the food is stacked. - Be silent! Gee! Plum jam! - We'd need a spoon... (inaudible) "No added dye" - But it tastes just like that! Like copper or brass! Maybe it's just on top of it. What's this? Gee! Ammunition! 50.000 for your share! Don't be a fool! You can rely on Statter. So... You won't mess this up! As long as we just talk about plum jam... OK. Count me in! The world wants to be cheated. It's their business if they kill each other. But you are planning to wrack up the Yorikke, you hogs! Our staff will die with that. I won't participate. - The tub is just overdue! Take look on our boilers. Scrap metal! The insurance is running out, we'll not get a new one. The repairs they demand will cost more than the whole tub is worth. The Yorikke will be wracked up anyways. All we are doing is to determine the date. What should happen? I think we should deal with the current business first, load some sand, insure it as being rubber, maybe take a little voyage, and... Merry Ascension! Not for your or for me. I'm planning to die on infirmity! As you will most likely die on alcohol poisoning. How many survivors besides the three of us? Of course all of them, James! If it's possible all of them. Don't take me for a moron! If just one of them will act as a witness at court, we all will go to jail. No, buddy! You want them to drown. All of them. James... As long as I'm on board, get rid of this plan. Do you want to quit before that? No! I'm staying. Good night! Statter has become an awkward character. Since he is a drunkard you can't rely on him. He used to be such a strong guy... Those are the negative effects of alcohol. His involvement in our current affairs don't seem to be sensible any more... Hey Statter! The captain told me to talk with you. Is that so? Can't be something good. The good things are told by himself. It IS nothing good. He wants you to quit. He can forget about that. If he leaves the next harbor without me... - That's why he wants you to leave before. Now! He has to tell me that personally. What are you doing here, boatswain? It's too hot in the bunk - Too hot? Well...donÂ´t be foolish, boys! Why is this chain not greased? What do you want, boatswain? How can you dare? Help! HELP! STOP! HELP! Help! HELP! Help! I don't understand why they come here at noon of all times. We are far away from the shore, Captain! Get your place at the ladder, nobody who is armed shall come on board! I don't think there will be any trouble. But if not, you are a good gunner. Captain! - What's happening? Found? - No! Neither in the tunnel of waves, nor in the cable passage! Neither in the rooms! I'm afraid of the worst, Captain! You mean overboard? Such an experienced man like Statter? You know about that drinking. One false step and... Boatswain, arrange a continuing search! - OK, Captain! ( foreign chatter) ( foreign chatter)... Morning Captain! So?... Don't you expect any surprises from the side of the coast? People who do surprise us will have a short life. Marvelous! Take it slow! Come on! Get it down! What will they do with all that plum jam? Maybe they are suffering with constipation. (foreign chatter)... You should have eaten before. I'll take a look... Gee, he's still sitting there! Amigo! Friend! Hey Pippip! Hey, how do you like my broad? Such a beauty! - Just swell. You're my friend. If you like, I'll sell her to you. How much per pound? I just can deliver her in one package. Thanks. You are too tiny for me! What? You're eating? Better get drunk! Well, he did drink sufficiently. Now his stomach needs a bit. Well, I could have imagined this. Here all alone...well... Listen: if you need some money... No need for that... Everything's done! Well... I'll have to go. Take care. You're looking quite bad. Well, girl... I've been squeezed like this lemon. Who is squeezing you? An old lady. Her name is Yorikke. A real bitch. Ger a divorce. - Divorce... To get divorced, you need papers! You think that bread is essential for living... water and salt... ...thats just rubbish! You got to have a passport! Understand? A rag of paper. Why? Yeah, why? I don't know. All I know is that they will catch me like a dog. If I try to run away. Hey you... I know somebody, he's called Henry and comes here quite often. Maybe he could help. A miracle doctor, right? Anyhow, there is nothing he won't do. I can imagine... Maybe you can negotiate to pay in rates. Shaba! - Yes? Get here! - Yes! I'll make a date... Nothing official! (mixed up foreign chatter) Not me... no way... (mixed up chatter)... Hurry up, I got a big surprise! Just guess where we are going... To the asylum! Wrong! To the photographer! I'll get a passport just like you. The Yorikke may scrub our asses! Why should anybody give a passport to us? And why should anybody give me this money? I'll tell you why: because there are some decent people left. Yeah sure." Hello, my name is Pippip, I'd like to get a fake passport!" "Sure, Mr. Pippip, no problem. Here it is, costs are just 1.000 Dollar!" "But I don't have any money!" "No problem, you'll get it for free, because you got such a nice face!" You're nuts! - It was exactly like that. But a man who's dealing with fake IDs! - That's just the one! He's got a kind of remorse. Because of that he likes to donate a little. But not a fake passport. Wait outside. We are not supposed to come together. Come in! I just heard you. Did you got the pictures? Yes, of course. So that's your friend. I liked the way you cared for him. He's my friend! And, er... he's in the same situation as you? Yes, we're in the same boat to a certain extent. It's better for us to be left alone. Lawski and me... we just couldn't believe this. It's like getting back to life. You said that very well. It's fun helping you. Your friend is American, too? No. Polish. - Polish! That's much easier. Did you think of a name for you? Have a seat! Thanks. You have to say Good Bye to Pippip. Well, my mother called me like that. Actually, my name is Philip... Philip Gale. Excellent! Why not stick to the truth for a change. Yes... You told me the other facts. Distinctive marks! Nothing. Yes... Right! You just have to sign. Everything else will be done by my office. I don't know what to say... Nothing. Just sign it. Right! We add those pictures... That's all for now. Don't be nervous. You'll get your passport. And your friend as well. I'm glad to do you a favour. And... you surely would be glad to do ME a favour, too. Yeah... sure thing. I thought so. How do you like this man? Well... I don't know. He's OK. - That's wrong! He's the most evil guy I know. And I know lots of evil guys. I'm not able to kill a fly, but I could crush him like a worm. My life is like hell because of him. So what? What shall I do about it? If this man dies, you'll get your passport, Philip. And your friend, too. It can only be done by a stranger. It's a very easy job for a stranger, because he got no motive. That's his house. The street is called "Path of the thousand palm trees". Each evening, he takes a walk. Alone, for 10 minutes. Just like a clock. It's a dark street, on both sides there are those palm trees. So I will stand behind one of those palm trees, right? You for yourself, or... You and your friend. You'll decide. You could get the passports this evening. Yes, I know. I just have to get accustomed to this. I don't know if I could do it... If you'd have said "Who was right?", I'd have killed you! Because I'm carrying a revolver. The passport are waiting for us up there. I was allowed to smell them. I just have to him a little favour. Don't you want to know which one? You'll tell me anyways. I shall kill one of his friends. That's all. This brain will be rotten some day! He almost convinced me to do something good. A poor old man awaiting his final days. You ARE doing something good. Of cause not for the old man, but for you! You'd never have to go back to the Yorikke, right? Yeah... just a swap! An old life... for two young ones. Not too bad. It's not that easy to kill a man who Didn't harm you. This is brand new. We should get some nice money for it. I know a sweet girl in France. I'll send it to her... No papers? No way! Our captain won't do that. You can come on board and get yourself a decent meal, of course. We were just asking. - I pay for all. Hey! Yesterday, a real junk tub arrived at the harbor. There he lays at the outer dock. How was it called? Yorikky or something like that. - Yeah. Not a noble ship, but on a tub like that, you'd have a chance for sure. That's a real good tip, right? Well, we'll do that. That's much better than just sitting here. I'd have a try. Bye! Thanks a lot! See... it all ends with the Yorikke. What has been my crime? I have fallen in love. With the Yorikke! With the good old Yorikke. I'll stay with her. Actually, she's a really fine ship. There are bugs in other places, too. Dirt as well... I won't get on board! Do what you like. I won't get on that ship of the dead! I'm finished. Nothing you can do about that. You won't get spirited again. Where do you wanna go? Running away? Give it a try! Over there begins the desert... Well... Maybe you'll survive... ... if you're fortunate. And then it all will start again. Fortune! Mylene! This is fortune... Signed, sealed... ready for delivery. Farewell Baby! Sorry, but I can't come to you. I sold myself to the Devil. Look... Look at him: there he is sitting, Lawski the Devil! Don't you agree? Who picked me up on that lousy ship? You're right! What else was I supposed to do? I would not have managed it alone by myself. Come on... somehow we'll get away from that old tub. Lawski! Just 8 hours left for the Yorikke. At midnight she'll die like a hero. It's a pity in some way... Police! Dils, we have to get away from the 3 mile zone. Damned! We won't be able to make that. We just have to. Do you think they will accept our sand cargo as being rubber? I will speed up those guys a little. - Hurry up! Hey! Yeah! What's happening? Speed up to 18, lazy bastards! Seems like the boss wants to blow up the whole joint! Piss off, dirty swine! The machines are running on full steam! Did they go mad? I can't reach it! Get out! OUT! Just get out! Damned! What are you doing up here? What do you think? That bloody machine is tearing up into pieces! Damned! The pressure valve is broken. - Didn't you fix it? Isn't it obvious? The valve got no long handle, which is against the rules! YOU have to fix that, you know that very well! Shut up! Who'll go down there? Lawski! Why haven't you been on duty down there? I was cleaning the boilers as I was told. So hurry up! There will be some rum later. Captain! - What's happening? We're loosing steam, the water pipes are broken! Fix that! Immediately! If there is no volunteer, I will choose someone. Who is on guard duty? Me! Come here! Wait a minute! You know that this man is very sick! He ain't nothing. It's just a chronic cough. It's OK, I'll do it. - You're mad! That makes no difference to me. Just wrap some rags around him! Buddy! Keep away from it! OK. Go down! Well, finally! Steam is going up. - Excellent! What about the police? Nothing! They just wanted to greet us. We were really lucky! Too much coal! Half of it would have been sufficient. It's our sad duty... ...to send our dear stoker Paul to eternal rest. He was one of the most loyal, but he also was not free from guilt. As the Holy Book tells: "There is not one, who is righteous. They are all sinners, without fame, which they will get from God!" God in Heaven, care for his soul! Amen! - Amen...Amen! Will anybody of you have a last word? God in Heaven, take also care for his murderers! Otherwise, we'd have to do it by ourselves! Get going! Come on... Get them loaded with booze. Otherwise, thereÂ´ll be a lot of trouble tonight! Captain, we can hear the surf at starboard! There must be a coast! - Nonsense! What's going on? 2.14 straight! I'm hoping that all goes well... Surf noises at starboard! All of you seem to be drunk! 3.0 straight starboard! We're running on full steam. The boilers will be bursting! I can't keep up with the speed! They must be mad up there. We're very fast today! Time again? - Yes, unfortunately... Hold the wedding, buddy! Something's wrong here. It sounds like surf... Pippip! Get up here! Come here at once! What's happening? GET UP HERE! What's this? We're drowning! Lars! HELP! Just hold it! Wait, I'll go over there. There's that swine! Captain! - Forget about Dils. We have to leave! Get out of the way, Boatswain! PIPPIP! Pippip! Pippip! Come here! - Yes! Those damned idiots! - Help... Maybe we'll get some papers now. Not fake ones, but real ones. There is an odd kind of compassion for shipwrecked guys all around this world. Damned, you're right! Our papers were just all right, but sadly, they were lost during the wreckage. Sure thing! What do you want to be? Eskimo? Dutch? Australian? Or King of the Zulus? I want to be a human being. And I'd write a letter... "Dear Mylene", I'd write... "I Didn't forget you" What about you? - Who, me? Nonsense! Damned! You know what? I think I'm getting sick. That's because of this mad position. Everything being skew and steep. I have to get out... Good idea. Some heavy weather in sight! Hey you! There's something going on... If the Yorikke will break into pieces on this reef, we are lost, buddy! Let's go backboard. It's safer there. I don't like this... Don't like it at all! If this continues, the waves will break the into the middle of the ship! I'll get some food! Otherwise it will be swept away! You'll be swept away, too! Well, I'll get upwards very... Fuck! Come on, we have to jump! The Yorikke is breaking... LAWSKI! PIPPIP! GET HERE! GET HERE! GET HERE! Oh my, whenever I'm thinking about that chamber full of food... Chamber with food! You're really entertaining me. Better get ready! Now our business is the last breath. I won't let that be taken away from me as well. Yeah. At least not this soon. Must be an infernal pleasure to fight with the fishes for a bite. I mean... if YOU are supposed to be the bite. Get out, Pippip! (inaudible) It wasn't too bad after all... Um. You always said that the water at the Yorikke is stinking... That's not true! I never said that, Lawski. Certainly not. The coffee at the Yorikke was a good one. On a good ship. Yes, Lawski. Sure thing. There... A ship. A ship. Where? There! Don't you see, buddy? A ship. The Yorikke. Our Yorikke! Where's the coffee? Did all of you you drink the whole stock? What do you mean? Nothing has happened. Nothing. What's wrong with you? Just now, as we have left all behind us. Just be glad! We have to go to the Yorikke! The grills have gone, the stoker lies in the boiler... We're drifting away, drifting away... I have to go there... Come on Pippip.... (inaudible) - NO! Stand up! Get away... Come on...come... - NO! Let me go! - There is no Yorikke! THERE IS NO YORIKKE! There is no Yorikke... I'm running. I'm running... Come back! Come back! STANISLAW! Stanislaw! Farewell... You don't need papers anymore. He's a good sailor... Subs by musiclova
