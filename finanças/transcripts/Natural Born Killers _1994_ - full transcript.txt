AUDlENCE: Aww! You a big... ...meat-eater, Mallory? I could be. You always dress like that? Or you just... ...waiting for me? Why would l dress like this for somebody I don't know? Maybe something inside you told you to. You know? Like fate. Do you believe in fate, Mallory? Maybe. You don't look happy. Wanna go for a ride? Talk about it? MOM: Ed, you promised your doctor no more meat. I eat what l want. So what? This fucking food here, you pray after you eat it. I don't want you to clog up your arteries and keel over at the table.

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS] MALLORY: Wherever we go... ...or whatever happens, Mickey... ...when I look up at the stars... ...l'il know you're looking up at the same ones. Same ones, baby. You make every day feel like kindergarten. MlCKEY: All right! Let's get a whole bunch of stuff, because l need a whole new wardrobe... ...because I'm a new woman now. I'm a new woman! MlCKEY: She's a new woman! MlCKEY: Past is behind us, Mal. It's time to grow up. We have the road to hell in front of us. -Mal? -Yes? Wiil you marry me? Of course I'll marry you. MALLORY: I've been waiting for you to say that for so long. Where we gonna get married? Right here, Mal. This is our church. I got a perfect thing. Give me your hand. That's not what l had in mind. Fuck you! Ow! Put them together. MALLORY: It's very romantic, baby. We'll be living in all the oceans now. MlCKEY: God, before you and this river and this mountain... ...and everything we don't know about... ...Mickey, do you take Maliory to be... ...your lawfui wedded wife, to have and hold and treat right until you die? I do. MALLORY: Oh, baby. Maliory, do you take Mickey to be your--? [MEN SHOUT] Won't murder anybody on our wedding day. MALLORY: Fuck you! God! I do. For all eternity... ...untii you and l die... ...and die and die again. Till death do us part. -Yes. -Baby, by the power vested in me... ...as God of my world... ...l pronounce us husband and wife. WAYNE [ON TV]: After that, there was no stopping Mickey and Mallory. They tore up the countryside with a vengeance right out of the Bible. WAYNE: Tonight l'm standing on Highway 666... ...running through towns like Cortez... ...Shiprock, Sheep Springs and ending in Gallup, New Mexico. To some, a beautiful stretch of the American landscape... ...but to Mickey and Mallory Knox, who are still at large... ...it is literally a candy lane of murder and mayhem. Patrolman Gerald Nash... ...was the first of 1 2 peace officers that Mickey and Mallory murdered... ...during their reign of terror. Gerald and his partner, Dale Wrigley... ...were parked at this doughnut shop, Alfie's Donuts, when.... This 1 970 Dodge Challenger pulled up across the street. DALE: Gerald, only three weeks out of the academy... ...walked out with a coffee... GERALD: Thanks, folks. ...and my bear claw. MAN: Hey, you. Driver asked him a question. Where's Farmington? DALE: Looked like he was giving street directions. Take it over to 66... ...and Farmington's up 65 miles. Quick ride. You going there? DALE: When he finished and waved him thanks... ...then up come that shotgun. You cop-killing cocksuckers! MALLORY: Whoo-hoo! [GUNSHOTS] [SIREN WAILS] WAYNE: In the ensuing chase... ...a tragic murder occurred. American bronze medalist marathon bicyclist.... We raped and pillaged the first show to do this. We changed the order so it's less obvious. It needs a new intro. You can't cannibalize yourself all the time. WAYNE: Repetition works. -You'il wind up with shit. -Repetition works. You think that those nitwits in zombie-land remember anything? It's junk food for the brains. Filler. Fodder. Whatever. Just build to the interview. Keep saying that word, "Live interview with Wayne Gale!" Anticipation. That's what it's all about. -Mickey and Mallory? -Hot. I love Mickey and Mallory! They're so cool. They're so great! [CHEERlNG] They're the best thing to happen to mass murder since Manson. But way cooler. MAN: Take great figures from the States: Elvis. Jack Kerouac. James Dean. They are super cool. [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] MAN: Jim Morrison, Jack Nicholson... ...add a bloody pail of nitrate and you got Mickey and Mailory. KlD: I don't believe in mass murder... ...or that shit. Don't get us wrong. We respect human life and all. But if I was a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory. I haven't seen a cop for 1 0 minutes. Is there such thing as a copless town? That'd be paradise, wouldn't it? Shangri-la. Want a hostage? No. What about her? From here? What about her? Too heavy? Too fat? What's the matter? Do you think I'm stiil sexy? We might have to find us a motel here soon. When I see one that looks nice... ...l'il put my honey-bunny bride down on the bed. Tie her up. [GlGGLES] NARRATOR [ON TV]: --offering a present in the form of a flower. MALLORY: Wanna go out and get something to eat? No. We'll stay in. We got plenty of action here. Know what l've been thinking about? Course l know. You're thinking about rolling around in that sunflower patch... ...outside of Tulsa. MALLORY: How'd you know? And you been thinking about cutting your hair short. And you been thinking about us settling down on a boat... ...in a big lake, with a dog and a jukebox... ...and a 26" Sony Trinitron. I love it when you can read my mind. I bet l know what you been thinking about. I been thinking about why they making all these stupid movies. Anybody out there in Holiywood believe in kissing anymore? Love you, baby. I love your knee. Love your thigh. Love your stomach. Love your finger. Where is it? Goddamn it, Mickey! I just took it off so l wouldn't snag my hair when l washed it. Okay, baby, look. Even if that ring pulls out every hair on your head, it stays on. If it tears out my eyebails, it never comes off. Every great thing we do starts with these. MALLORY: All right. Since you put it that way. NARRATOR [ON TV]: The impulse for sexual reproduction is strong and unique. That's what makes our planet.... Why are you looking at her? Mickey. I'm going for a ride. Baby, hold on. l thought maybe we could just throw her into the mix. MALLORY: Shut up! Shut up! Quit being so fucking cute! You can be cute by yourself. Little Mickey, you're so fucking pretty! You go fuck her. MlCKEY: Maybe I just will! MlCKEY: Ready to have some fun? [MUFFLED SCREAMS] [ROARS] [GUNSHOTS] WOMAN: No! MALLORY: Fill her up. MALLORY: Can l look at that car? ATTENDANT: Go ahead. ATTENDANT: That'll be 1 7 bucks, lady. MALLORY: That's a nice Vette. Wait a second. Don't l know you? I don't think so. Do you want to touch me? Yeah. Tell me you want me. I want you. Tell me I'm beautiful. You are beautiful. Am l beautiful? So beautiful, l can't stand it. Am l sexy? Yes. You're sexy. Go down. Holy shit! You're Mallory Knox, ain't you? That's the worst fucking head I ever got in my life! Next time don't be so fucking eager. JACK: It's cailed Scagnetti on Scagnetti, in your bookstore. -Go buy it. -l will. SHERlFF: An author too, huh? My wife could never wear these. Now that is a perfect ass. It's nice. JACK: There's her arm. Her head. Dry saliva drops. See? [MALLORY MOANS] That's my type of girl. l like her. Let's see what we got here, scooter. Give it up. Maliory Knox... ...meet Jack Scagnetti. Hey, exactly where do you expect us to be going? Where are we supposed to be? What town is it that's out here? MALLORY: Fuck, it's the fucking cheese. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MALLORY: Quit looking in the rear-view. Sit back. Put the lighter on the floor. Put it on the floor, Mickey. MlCKEY: Bury the bag. -Mal? -What? MlCKEY: Would you relax? Turn left. I think there's a town. All I see is desert. MlCKEY: That's right, Cochise... ...go eat some more fried bread. Give me some 'shrooms, Mal. Mine ain't kicking in yet. [LAUGHS] [CAR SPUTTERS] MlCKEY: Turn left? Turn left to what, you stupid bitch? MALLORY: "You stupid bitch." "You stupid bitch"? "You stupid bitch!" Mickey, that's what my father used to call me! Thought you'd be more creative than that. You're losing it, Mickey! You're losing it! Snakes and birds. Ain't nothing out here. I'd go down on a lawman for a gailon of gas. Let me tell you something. This is the 1 990s. In this day and age, a man has to have choices. A man has to have variety. MALLORY: What do you mean, "variety"? Hostages? You want to fuck some other women now? Is that what you mean? Why'd you pick me up? Why take me out of my house... ...and kill my parents with me? Ain't you committed to me? Where are we fucking going? Relax. lt's me, your lover... ...not some demon, not your father. All right, relax. MALLORY: No, you're not my fucking lover! You're not my-- You've been fucking loving me? You been loving me real true! [SHEEP BLEAT] Hey, listen, we got tobacco, lots of tobacco. You got any gas we can buy? MALLORY: I don't think he speaks English. Push comes to shove, we can snatch that donkey and ride out of here. Come in. Come on in. [SNAKE RATTLES] MlCKEY: Oh! MALLORY: Oh, my God! Friendly snake? It's a rattlesnake. My name is Mallory. This is Mickey. How... ...you doing? [SPEAKING IN NAVAJO] We're not from here. [SPEAKING IN NAVAJO] This is like The Twilight Zone. Is that your wife? Oh. [SPEAKING IN NAVAJO] MALLORY: He died?

You're gonna make it. Get mad. Go get the stuff then. All right. WAYNE: They were average, living drab, nothing-ever-happens lives. But then these sweethearts began a cross-country murder spree... ...which has lasted only three terrifying weeks... ...but has left 48 known bodies in its wake... ...including... ...Mallory.s own mum and dad. Oh, shit. MlCKEY: Excuse me. Aloha? Chief? Rattlesnake took a chunk out of us a ways back. Me and my wife are pretty sick. Could be dying, you never can teil about these things. How's about you ungluing your fat ass from that boob tube... ...and getting us some snake juice... ...pronto. WAYNE: --depraved and sick actions. They started off as armed robbers.... Found it yet? They stormed in with shotguns... ...and after liberating the establishment of all the firearms they could carry... ...and various personal idiosyncratic knickknacks... ...they killed every customer... ...without hesitation. MlCKEY [ON TV]: Come on! Money! Faster! WAYNE: But they always leave one clerk alive... ...to tell the tale of Mickey... ...and Mallory. I'll be damned. Mal! You piece of shit! Mal? MlCKEY: Mal!

You know what? I even bought your book. I read the whole damn thing. How about an autograph? WURLlTZER: Warden... ...Jack Scagnetti. JACK: There you go. DWlGHT: Dwight McClusky. Weicome to hell. JACK: Great to meet you, warden. How are my two favorite assholes? We got them two in there. Wanna see them? JACK: Why not? DWlGHT: Come on. I seen you on TV. I even read your goddamn book. I'm impressed. Surprised Hollywood ain't found you. Your story would be a better movie than Serpico. In all of my days in the penal business-- And that ain't no small amount, right? -Oh, no. -Nope. Mickey and Mailory are the most twisted, depraved fucks... ...l have ever laid my damn eyes on. These two motherfuckers are a walking reminder... ...of how fucked up the system is. Don't get me started, okay, warden? Dwight. You call me Dwight. They killed inmates and guards? Three inmates, five guards and one shrink. Open that damn gate. Psychiatrist? Maliory strangled him when he made the mistake of asking about her parents. She done it shot up on tranquiiizers. Ain't love grand? Ain't that the truth? It's like that other big lie: "Love makes the world go around." [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] How did you get to be a specialist in psychos? I'd recommend having your mother killed by one. After that, I deveioped a keen interest. -What happened? -l was born in Texas. -You don't have an accent. -l don't want to talk iike those asses. -My mother was from Texas. -l mean the other asses. The ones who beat me up. Anyway, when l was 8 years old... ...my mother took me to the park. It was the same day Charles Whitman... ...climbed the University of Texas Tower and started shooting. -You was with her? -Sure was. I didn't hear any of the shots. I'm with my mother and suddeniy... ...chest explodes. She falls, and l'm just looking at her. Her arm flies off, her hip explodes. And l.m not hearing any of the shots. JACK: Aah! You fucking-- Boom! Her chest explodes. [INAUDIBLE DlALOGUE] I was lying on the grass being eaten alive by ants, thinking: .'What happened to my mom?'. Since then, I've had a strong opinion... ...about the psychopathic fringe that thrives in this fast-food culture. I don't show the self-discipline becoming of a peace officer. You got it right, Jack. You don't mind if l cail you Jack? [MAN SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY OVER SPEAKERS] DWIGHT: We got an army of shrinks. Talks about mania... ...and schizophrenia and multi-phrenia and obsessions. And it makes me sick. It's arrogance, bulishit. Mickey and Maliory are not the sickest l've seen. -Open it. -Yes, sir. MAN [OVER SPEAKERS]: Tonight's movie will be Escape from the Pianet of the Apes. JACK: Why me? What's this really about? DWlGHT: Can you feel it? -Silence in the air? JACK: Yeah. You don't want it in a prison. Silence. You boys all right? What the fuck is you looking at? I said what the fuck you looking at? DWlGHT: Drop it! Try this on, big boy. You son of a bitch! Come on up here! Get your ass over here! Come on, goddamn it. By God! Stick his ass in the block then bring him to see me. You all right? Jesus Christ, you could be on American Gladiators. Thirty minutes a day. It doesn't take much. Someone goes for you, go for their throat. DWlGHT: One chop paralyzes them. Mickey and Mailory got my whole prison worked up. WURLlTZER: Like sharks to chum. -Smell of blood drives them nuts. -80 percent are violent offenders. -We're over 200 percent capacity. -This ain't a prison, it's a time bomb. -Fry the pricks. -We tried. But they kill somebody new, and we gotta start the process over again. JACK: Like a hemorrhoid you can't get rid of. We're sending them for testing to Nystrom. JACK: Lobotomy Bay. DWlGHT: Vegetable Land. Home of the criminally insane. -That hasn't been done. -The ruling won't stick... ...with the shrinks here, but they'il be in your control for a few hours. Then what? You're a celebrated lawman, public loves you. Fifteen years on the force. Bestseller out in paperback. A modern-day Pat Garrett with a deadiy ax to grind. That is why you have been chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We know once you're on the road, if anything happens-- -An accident. -Fire. -Escape attempt. -Anything at ail. Jack Scagnetti will look out for his public's best interest. I get the picture. Nobody in their right mind will cry if these fuckers take a little lead. A lot of lead, Jack! Write the script, call it: The Extermination of Mickey and Mallory Knox. I don't care. You'll have my two best men: Kavanaugh and Wurlitzer. We got a special disliking for these punkolas. Have we found our man? DWlGHT: You know her... ...you love her, you cannot fucking live without her: Maliory Knox. [MALLORY SlNGS "BORN BAD"] DWlGHT: Hey, Knox, somebody out here wants to meet you. Jesus Christ! She always does this. JACK: She ain't changed a bit, huh? Where's the other half? In the deepest, darkest ceil in the dungeon. You can't see him now. He's got a special visitor. -Who's that? -Wayne Gale. Wayne Gale? The TV scumbag? We call them media. Don't you like the media? A worm in my blood is more attractive to me. He fucks cops over. Can't say no to the media. You want this job? You come say hello. WAYNE: I have a television show. Every few weeks, as part of our thing on current America... ...we do a profile on a different serial killer. Mass murderer. Whatever you want. The episode on Mickey and Mallory was one of the most popular. -Ever do one on John Wayne Gacy? -Yeah. MlCKEY: Who got the higher rating? -You blew him away. What about that crazy fucker, Ted Bundy? That crazy guy? You got the larger Nielsen share. You're big. -What I want to get-- -What about Manson? Manson beat you. It's hard to beat the king. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, Julie, my producer, and l... ...have been waiting to do a follow-up piece on you, and that time has come. [LAUGHS] I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on... ...that the prison boys have violated the Constitution. You and Maliory may be killers, but nuts? lnsane? Today they wipe ciean your mind because they feel you're dangerous. They might clean my mind or dump me into syndication... ...because what I say is dangerous. Where does it end? I have interviewed the prison board and psychiatrist, Reingold... ...and with Warden Dwight McClusky, and l tell you, they iook bad. If you give an exclusive... ...to Wayne Gaie, we are talking a media event here. Promos on the Super Bowl. The network will cream for it! What a great idea, Julie. We are talking about nothing iike it... ...in television history. The first in-depth interview... ...with the most charismatic serial killer ever... ...one day before he's shipped away to a mental hospital... ...for the rest of his life. This is Wallace and Noriega. This is Elton John... ...confessing his bisexuality to Rolling Stone. This is Maysles brothers at Altamont. This is the Nixon/Frost interviews. What do you say? -Why are you ietting him do this? -Reiax. If l don't, we'll be excoriated. If l do, they won't clear it for weeks. Legal, appeals. M & M wiil be toast before that ever happens, right? Nobody's gonna give a flying fuck about two dead losers. WAYNE: What are you saying? DEPUTY: Time, motherfucker. Leave him aione! He's a human being, for chrissake. Wait a minute! Let him answer me! Time's running out, mate. What's the answer? I say go for it. [LAUGHS] WAYNE: Well, in any case, he says yes. DWlGHT: Thought he would. Keep contact with the population to a minimum. WAYNE: Give me a room, l'll take it from there. We're stealth journalists. You shouid worry more about the promos that start to air next week. You'll be a national face, a real hero to the American public. It's true. You could even iaunch a new career here. DWlGHT: No! WAYNE: Julie will fax you in the morning with the details. I must get back. I'm doing a benefit for the homeless transsexual veterans. [CELL DOOR CLOSES] MlCKEY: Dearest Mailory... ...you once told me I had no feelings. You were right and wrong. I got more feelings now than l ever had before. I've been reading a lot and doing yoga with this guy... ...but he pissed me off. [BACK SNAPS] He's not around anymore. At night... ...i pretend you're lying next to me. I iie in my cell... ...imagine kissing you... ...not making love... ...just kissing for hours and hours on end. I remember everything about our time. I remember every secret you ever shared. I remember every single time you laughed. And your dancing. My God, your dancing. I iie on my bed and go over every day, every minute of our happiness. I take it all as it comes... ...and I live that day again. That way, when I get to our first kiss... ...they're not just memories. I feel that joy again. WAYNE: Dr. Reingold... ...are they insane? Insane? No. Psychotic, yes. It's right after the Super Bowl. We got them in their homes, the game sucked... ...they want to see Mickey. EMlL: Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with vioience. These guys wanna tear their wives' heads off. But, Suilivan-- EMlL: Mickey and Mailory... ...know the difference between right and wrong. They just don't give a damn. WAYNE: This wili be the most talked about event in television history! Is it true they were sexually abused as children? I can't imagine. I don't think that it's.... I would say no. When you said to marry your daughter after I got her pregnant... ...that's exactly what I did. Now you listen to me. WAYNE: If you blow this... ...CBS will eat your lunch next season, and l'il be with them... ...because I'm out of here! I'm out! Maliory Knox has said that she does want to kili you. I never reaily believe what women say to me. WAYNE: Maggie! Margaret, darling... ...whatever you think you found, it's not what you think. MAGGlE: Tell me who the hell Ming is. Ming? There's no Ming. That's a fucking restaurant. Why are you going through my drawers? I don't go through yours. WAYNE: lt looks like it was cut with a meat cleaver. Where's my close-ups? Listen, less of the shrink. Keep the teens, keep the long hairs. I love the cop. I love McClusky. Cut in on the middle of that horrific laugh. Freeze-frame on it. Then cut to me at the trial. WAYNE: Their subsequent trial... ...turned into a sick, pathetic circus. The nation caught Mickey... ...and Mallory fire. Mike ******* Griffin is who these misguided ***holes should revere. Mike Griffin was killed in the line of duty by these ****-sucking... ...degenerate ******bags. CROWD: We want Mickey We want Mallory -What do you think of the turnout? -l've never had more fun! Scumbag! Ming, first of ail, siow down. Speak English. MING: All right, English. -You're paranoid. -She knows. -She's not onto us. I don't give a fuck what the I Ching says! Just don't put anything down on paper, ever. WAYNE: If she calis back... ...you say, "Hello, Ming Dynasty Restaurant." What do you have to say to your fans? You ain't seen nothing yet. JACK: How'd you let this show go live? DWlGHT: Just got out of hand. Doesn't change a thing, though. I'm moving those scumbags tomorrow. JACK: You know, Dwight... ...when I do these douche bags, I'll go right up there with Jack Ruby. JACK: World famous, huh? Hall of Fame. You'll be bigger, Jack. Lee Harvey Oswald was a pussy. -Maybe, but he was a great shot. -Hear it? [SILENCE] -Hear what? DWlGHT: lt's dead quiet. It's dangerous when it's dead quiet. [CROWD CHEERS] Ahem. Okay, testing, one, two, three. How goes it, brother? Doing some hard time? What'd they get you for? -Murder. -That's a rough one. l'm with you. Showtime. TV ANNOUNCER 1 : And the Dallas Cowboys are the Super Bowl Champions.... TV ANNOUNCER 2: After the game, stay tuned... ...for a special American Maniacs on WATCH. Mickey Knox is the most dangerous man in America. But Wayne Gale isn.t afraid to meet him one on one... ...to learn what 48 people died for. Is he insane, or does he belong where he sent so many others: in the grave? Mickey Knox, thank you for this time. I'd like to start with a few questions, if you don't mind? That's ******* nice, Wayne. When did you first start thinking about killing? Birth. l was thrown into a flaming pit of scum, forgotten by God. [CHUCKLES] What do you mean? I mean, l came from violence, it was in my blood. My dad had it. MlCKEY: His dad had it. it's my fate. Do you believe in fate? -My fate. -No one is born evil, you iearn it. What about your father? How did he die? You were oniy 1 0 years oid, and there's a lot of speculation. [GUNSHOT] I didn't kiil my father, and l don't want to talk about it. WAYNE: Watch it! Watch it! It's all right. lt's okay. It's okay. It's all right. Go on to something else. Okay? Please, let's do. WAYNE: Tell me, how can you look at an ordinary person, an innocent guy... ...and then shoot him to death? -l mean, how can you do that? MlCKEY: Innocent? Who's innocent? You? I'm innocent of murder, definitely. It's just murder. All God's creatures do it in some form or another. I mean, look in the forest. Species kill other species. Our species killing ail species... ...including the forest, and we just cali it industry, not murder. But l know a lot of people who... ...deserve to die. WAYNE: Why do they deserve to die? MlCKEY: I think everybody got... ...something in their past. Some sin. Some awful, secret thing. MlCKEY [ON TV]: A lot ofpeople walking around already dead... ...just need to be put out of their misery. That's where l come in. Fate's messenger. Except a corn or wheat falleth to the ground... ...and die, it abideth alone. But if it die... ...it bringeth forth much fruit. The theory that everyone meets a serial killer halfway? The wolf don't know why he's a woif. God just made it that way. You're saying that the worid itself is predatory. When a lion takes down an elk, it's the elk's time to go. And the B.S. liberal agenda about saving the herds... ...only serves to overpopuiate the balance of nature. Maybe you're right. I don't think so, but maybe you are. Corporate and environmental predators. Nuciear predators. Life is a hunt. I've seen it, l was there. When the **** hit the fan at Grenada, I saw it all... ...go down at Grenada. So tell me, Mickey, any regrets? I mean, three weeks, 50 people killed. Not too cooi, Mickey. Fifty-two, but l don't spend a lot of time with regret. It's a wasted emotion. You must have some regret. Rack your brain. I wish that lndian hadn't got killed. Bad, bad, bad! One of your last victims. Man had a rattlesnake sitting in a corner. A rattlesnake? He could pick it up, pet it. He saw it. He saw what? The demon. He saw the demon. The demon? What demon? Everybody got the demon in here. The demon lives in here. It feeds on your hate. Cuts, kills, rapes. MlCKEY [ON TV]: It uses your weakness, your fears. Only the vicious survive. We all told we're no good pieces of shit since we could breathe. After a while, you kind of become bad. But after the lndian, we were gonna quit killing. The old man took it out of us. What happened? It was all just a mistake, you know. Man tried to help us. You know, pet us. Same dream l've had since I was a kid. l just.... Running, running with the animais in the darkness. Mr. Rabbit. Bloody fangs. Christmas hat. Little... ...madness going on, we're just running.... I'm just.... I'm Mr. Rabbit. I'm eating every other animal in the forest. Death. Death kind of becomes what you are. After a while, you begin to like it. You know about realization, Wayne? I mean, all this is just... ...an iilusion. Mr. Rabbit says, "The moment of realization...." "The moment of reaiization... ...is worth... ...a thousand prayers." You're crazy. I don't think I'm any crazier than you are. I'm extremes, dark and light, you know that. I'm light with Mal. Mal. Mal. That's your shadow on the wall. Can't get rid of your shadow, can you? You know, the only thing that kills a demon: Love. That's why Maliory's my salvation. She was teaching me how to love. MALLORY: I forgive you, baby. It was just like... ...being in the Garden of Eden. Only love can kill the demon. Hold that thought. [SNOW CRUNCHlNG] [GRUNTlNG] If these guys are in your eye line, l'm sorry. You want some powder? Mmmm! Rise and shine, Mallory. GUARD: Turn around and face the wail. Relax, we want to have a talk, is all. GUARD: Don't get too close or she'li kill you. One way or another, she'll kill you. Relax. Read my book. I met some unruly crocodiles... ...but she's got a sweet streak for me. Take that. It's okay. -We're not allowed.... -lt's okay. It's okay, guys. Smoke? I know you smoke. I'm not here to hurt you. I want to be your friend. If l ever met a girl who needs a friend... ...it's you. You're a very pretty girl. Remember the last time you got fucked? Remember? I want you to close your eyes... ...and remember the last time Mickey gave you the hard one. Thinking about it? [MALLORY LAUGHS] Forget it, because it's never gonna happen again. When they get through with all the electroshock shit... ...Mickey ain't gonna be worth a shit. Was it worth it? Was what worth it? Was massacring those people worth being separated from your love forever? You mean, was an instant of my purity worth a lifetime of your lies? Explain where's the purity you couldn't live without... ...in the 52 people... ...who aren't on this planet because they met you and Mallory. What's so ******* pure about that? How do you do it? MlCKEY: You'll never understand. You and me aren't even the same species. I used to be you, then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. To me, you're an ape. Not even an ape, you're a media person. Media's like the weather, only it's man-made weather. Murder? It's pure. You're the one made it impure. You're buying and selling fear. You say, .'Why?" I say, "Why bother?" Are you done? Great. Now let's cut the B.S. and get real. Why this purity that you feel about killing? Why, for chrissakes? Don't lie! You just gotta hold that shotgun in your hand, and it becomes ciear... ...like it did for me the first time. That's when I realized my one true calling in life. What's that, Mickey? Shit, man... ...l'm a natural born killer. JULlE: And that's commercial. Two minutes, guys. Did you get that? INMATE: All right, Mickey! [GLASS SHATTERS] [INMATES YELLING] [PHONE BUZZES] WAYNE: Great. Great, man. That was fucking brilliant. LEROY: There's a riot going on here. -Shit! Thanks. Every fucking moron in the world just saw that, mate. LEROY: We got a riot going on here that's out of control. We need help. God Almighty shit, Leroy. Where at? In the rec room, B wing. We're outmanned, we need help. All right. You mobilize the men. I'm on my way. Mr. Gale, close them cameras down. We got a riot going on in B wing. -We're live, for chrissakes! -You're finished. -Millions are watching. -They got guns, hostages! Close those cameras, now! -Turn them off! -We'il be famous! You stay here and shut up. I must find out what's going on before l let you film anywhere. The worid is watching! We'll never get this chance again! Fuck you! He can't tell me what to do in my jail! Fuck him! WAYNE: Fuck you! DWlGHT: Keep your fingers on the trigger of your shotguns and foliow me. INMATE 1 : Get his ass up here! INMATE 2: Come on! [SCREAMlNG] Help! No! Oh, God, no! No! Oh, no!

[LAUGHlNG] They go, they come back. Mother takes Johnny aside and says, "What happened?" Little Johnny can't talk. She says, "They went to the drive-in. What happened then?" Johnny goes: [KISSlNG NOISES] "They were kissing? What else?" You heard this one? "What else?" Little Johnny goes: "He felt her up? What else?" Little Johnny goes: "They took off their clothes? What else?" Little Johnny goes: "They did that? What the hell were you doing?!" Little Johnny goes: "Little Johnny, no!" Oh, shit! Aah! Drop it! The gun, goddamn it! Smart move. Okay. Empty the shells. Hurry up! Everybody raise your hands! KAVANAUGH: You think you're getting out of here, boy? They're gonna mop you up, they're gonna put you in a bucket. You're the law.

It's all yours anyway! And one more thing: Piss off, you cunt! It's good to be with you. You do a lot of good for people. The joint's expioding, and you're diddling around with these two! -We have more important things to do! -These two die today! You hear me? I'll wipe that fucking scum off the face of the fucking earth... ...if it's the last fucking thing I do! You know what l say? I say... ...to heil with going to our cells. Let's go out there... ...and run down the stairs and go out in a hail of bullets. And then we'll die. Then we'll really be free. That's poetry. But we'll do that when all else fails. -l just left her. MlNG: What do you mean? That's right. Put a bottle of Dom on ice. Get some ecstasy.

That wasn't the question. Are you married? DUNCAN: Yes, l'm married. Do you have children? A boy and a girl. I don't wanna die. MlCKEY: Mal, come here, please. The only way we'li get out that front door... ...is if they don't wanna kill you two more than they wanna kili us. Mr. Journalist! Okay, hold that. Duncan Homolka, Wayne Gale. How are you? You want reality? You got it. WAYNE: My name is Wayne Gale! I am the star of American Maniacs, watched by 40 million people a week! I am a respected journalist, winner of the Ed R. Murrow and the Golden Globe... ...to name a few. I've been shot! You're on camera! We are live! If anyone fucks up our escape... ...l'il make it my mission to put Warden McClusky out of commission! I wili do expose after expose, revealing the inhumanity, brutaiity... ...and conditions that exist here! You, back up! Back up! My name is Wayne Gale! I'm the star of American Maniacs! You are on camera! We are live! Just how far do you think you're gonna get? MlCKEY: Out the front door. That will never happen! MlCKEY: It is happening. My name is Wayne Gale!

I wili personally hunt you down, blow the head off your whore wife... Don't disrespect my man! ...and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself! Another day, perhaps, but not today. [INMATES YELLING] [GUNFlRE] [DWlGHT WHlMPERS] This is Wayne Gale, unfortunately no longer live. I am wounded. All my crew is dead. I have left my wife, and my girifriend has left me. MALLORY: Don't look that glum. That was good. Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked out the door into my news van and made our getaway. When we were foliowed by patrol cars... ...Mallory shot Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka... ...and tossed his body out. MlCKEY: Show them your ear. MALLORY: Oh, my God, that is so gross. Why helicopters were not deployed, I don't know. I guess it happened too fast for arrangements to be made. We've pulled to the side of the road to do this interview. Tensions run high as we-- MlCKEY: We don't got all fucking day. So without further ado: Mickey and Mailory. So, Mallory, after Mickey's incredible rescue... ...what did you think next? I was wondering how iong it'd be... ...untii me and Mickey couid be alone, and if I could wait that long. WAYNE: Did you have anything to do with the riot? We didn't have nothing to do with that riot. You know, that was.... Whatchamacallit? -Fate? -Fate. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole fucking thing, let them. It's not like it's gonna keep us up at night and stuff. But the truth is... ...it was... ...fate. Yes. Fate it was. You saw it right here on American Maniacs. You believe in reincarnation, Wayne? Yes, l believe we've all lived many times. So, what's next for the Knoxes? Well, l'm thinking we can lay in a big king-size bed... ...and sleep... ...for two days, and l've been thinking about motherhood. So l think me and Mickey are gonna get started on that... ...as quickly as possible. -Gotta go. WAYNE: Wait. How do you intend to disappear? You're the most famous couple in America. There's the Underground Railroad, when during slave times-- Let me swing the camera around... ...and do my wrap-up, then we're off. We're gonna do a wrap-up, all right. But it won't be you staring in the camera, looking dumb. You'll be staring down the barrels of our shotguns... ...and we're gonna be blowing your brains all over that tree. Wait. Time. Cut, cut, cut! It's a fucking joke, right? [GUNS COCKING] Don't fucking shoot me! During this escape, a bond developed between us! Not reaily. You're scum, Wayne. You did it for ratings. You don't give a shit about anybody except yourself. So nobody gives a shit about you. That's why helicopters weren't deployed. Wait a minute, you hypocrite. What about the Indian? You said you were done with killing! That love beats the demon! You said that love beats the demon! I am... ...and it will. It's just that you're the last one. No, don't kill me. This is not about you, you egomaniac. I kind of like you. But if we let you go, we'd be just like everybody eise. Killing you... ...and what you represent is... ...a statement. I'm not sure what it's saying... ...but, you know, Frankenstein killed Dr. Frankenstein. Wayne. [GUN COCKS] Have some dignity. All right. So l'm a parasite, so what? Life is cruel, and no one said it'd be easy. The day you two killed, your ass belonged to us! To the public! To the media! We are married, right? [LAUGHS] The point is... ...what do we do next? I say we do a Saiman Rushdie-type thing. Just books, taik shows. We lay iow, we jump up, we bob and weave. We get rid of them. we do Oprah, Donahue. Do you have any idea how huge we couid be? Let's make a little music. Wait, wait! Don't Mickey and Mallory always leave someone alive to tell the tale? -We are. Your camera. -Your camera. Okay. [CHANTS] [GUNSHOTS] I'm gonna miss him. -Come on, let's go. -Okay, baby. CHAVEZ: l can't hear him. I'm not getting anything. Oh, my God! A bride and groom's wedding reception turned into a nightmare. My dad.... People.... Because it would end in sex. That's all l thought about. He punched me, he slapped me again. I just wanna say, you know, can we...? Ready? [ENGLISH SDH]
