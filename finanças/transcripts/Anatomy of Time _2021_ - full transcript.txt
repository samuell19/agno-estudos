Can you get the baby to stop crying? Otherwise we're dead! You'll fucking get us all killed! Leave me alone! She was fucking spying for us, and you let her die like that! Calm down. Captain, calm down. - This is the last time I'm helping you. - Calm down. You can still pick your side. Think carefully! Captain, we already talked about this. Don't forget why we did this. But how many more must die to get the nation you want? You don't even know if it will lead to a better future. But you still let people die "just in case" it does! There are only two options. One... a ruthless leader with a fair system. Two... a system full of lies and dishonesty that lets the rich exploit the poor. Can you see any other options? As for the baby, let the soldiers deal with it. So you don't feel responsible. I can no longer help you, my friend. Look, Dad. Is this clock broken? The Bhumibol Dam is an arch-gravity dam that is 154 meters high and 486 meters long, with a base width of 52 meters. It is the largest in Southeast Asia. Chief, when did you get back? Just now, actually. I came straight here after my mission. Where have you been all this time? That's classified, sorry. Are you asking because you... Here, I brought you this. A gift from Europe that I got through my superior officer. That's very kind, thank you. I hope you'll like it. Isn't the market a bit quiet today? No more than usual. I have to go now. I'll come by again soon. Okay. Let's leave our bikes and walk from here. I haven't been here for a long time. If I was alone, I would be lost. You've been here before? Yes, I have. Ten years ago, there was a village here. But then, there was an epidemic and most people moved away, fled for their lives, leaving the village deserted. Weren't you afraid... like the others who left? No. My mother passed away in that epidemic. My father scattered her ashes here and refused to move away. I still remember it vividly. I was 12... and Toi was very little. Dad took us to pay our last respects to our mother. And he asked us, "What do you see?" But... what did he mean by that? I don't know. Do we need more bamboo? Not yet. Hello, Tee, the honey hunter. Hey. Hello, Don. I wasn't expecting you. Wow! This is big. Yes, they're giant honey bees. They can sting people to death. Aren't you afraid of them? No, I'm not. See, this is the trick. Look at what we do. You see? We fumigate the hive, forcing the bees to swarm out. They eat honey in a panic, and their stingers retract, so they can't sting. All honey hunters know this trick. Earlier, honey was used as medication. Young women put it on their faces. It'll make your skin as smooth as Cleopatra's. Hey, be careful. They might come down here. Is it true that the male adult bees gather around their virgin queen to mate? Yes, they try to mate with her mid-air. The one that succeeds is considered lucky... but dies right away. Why is that? The queen bites off its genitals, so it falls to the ground and dies. How badly hurt is he, sweetheart? It's pretty bad, Dad. His nose needs a metal pin. He had a run-in with the wrong people. They beat him really badly. Poor kid. Dad, is it true that we all have to pay for our sins? Yes, sweetheart. And do we really reap what we sow? Yes, of course. That's what we Buddhists believe. We say that our actions determine the course of our lives. Western people say it's Jehovah who decides. For Muslims, it's Allah. Chinese people say it's heaven and earth. And people who practice Hinduism say that everything comes from Brahma, the god of creation. That's why, we believe that Brahma creates "fate." Do heaven and hell really exist? I don't know. What about nirvana? Nirvana? Let's say someone... walks into a cave and lights a candle. This brave man sets out into the mysterious cave with determination, guided by the light of just one candle. He encounters many obstacles and almost gives up, but he steadies himself, gathers strength, musters his courage, and carries on. In the end, he comes across a path that leads him to discover a secret. He knows right away that this is the most precious thing in human life. He then leaves the cave and tells his disciples what he has seen there without hesitation. Later, a second man with a brighter torch walks into the same cave. He takes a different path through the cave and encounters different obstacles. But he also manages to make it to the end of the cave. That man comes out of the cave and he too explains what he witnessed to his disciples. Finally, a third man enters the same cave with a powerful flashlight. He shines the flashlight all around the cave... and sees things differently. The third man then leaves the cave, and explains what he saw to his disciples. Some religions may focus upon the journey through the cave, others on what was found deep inside it. Different names for the same thing. Maybe not nirvana. Perhaps heaven and hell, or whatever they choose to call it. Whatever experience a messiah or a prophet may have had. Thank you. Have you been here often, Chief? Just a couple of times. There was opium here until it was prohibited. The view up there is really beautiful. 150 calling Peter. 150 calling Peter. Do you copy? Location, 500 meters from meeting point. Over. Copy that. Let's go. Can I leave you alone here for a moment? Yes. George! Corporal Sittikorn Thepsuwan, Special Forces, reporting. Nothing to report on my shift, sir. At ease. What is it? The latest radio report from headquarters. Our leader's health is declining. He's not going... to make it through the night. Fuck. We must all be more careful. Do you like it? What? The mountains and this village. I do, yes. You told me you prefer the sea, but I brought you here instead, so I was afraid you wouldn't like it. How did that tree manage to grow up there? Which one? That one. Oh, okay. Well, I guess it can't have been any harder than getting us both up here. Do you think so? When we left the cave, what did you pray for? Back there? No, I didn't pray for anything. I was just giving thanks that they haven't called me back to the base yet. Well, actually... it was you I wanted to thank. For giving me this opportunity to spend time with you. I just wanted to say that... us being here together really means a lot to me. Grandma... Not able to sleep? Let's move your legs. My legs? Hold onto me. Up you come. One, two, three... I'm sorry. The coup instigators found themselves in a corner. The First Army Commander and the group deputy telephoned in to surrender. He went to Korat by helicopter, arriving at 1:53 p.m., exhausted and accompanied by his wife. The coup leader escaped by helicopter to the jungle to cross the Burmese border on foot. The Thai Young Turks were later pardoned for staging the coup. Some served the government and retired as generals. Some became senior government advisors. Fuck! Shit! Fuck. Shit. Asshole. Go. Asshole. You, I hope you suffer more and more for a very long time. I hope your death is slow and painful. A curse on you. Shit! Shit! Breathe in. Breathe in. Breathe in. And again. Make the three balls rise together. Fucking machine. He's there. When he wakes up later, please tell him that we all know now that he's out of hospital. Okay. That's why I was sent to visit him here. He made big sacrifices for our nation. We never forget about him. - George. - Yes, sir. Tell us a funny story to keep us awake. The one about you and Ruengsin in Laos. What story? Tell Maem the story. This is how it started. Ruengsin, the driver, and I were coming back from patrol. The road was narrow and bumpy, like this one, through thick forest. Then we encountered something suspicious. It was a huge tree blocking the entire road. The driver braked hard and came to a stop. I was the senior officer, so I decided to take a look. I looked around the area, to make sure there weren't any Communist guerrillas hiding out. To be safe, I radioed the base to ask for a disposal team to clear the area. While we were waiting, the sun set and it got dark. We fell asleep waiting. After a while, we heard a bang... behind the jeep. I jumped up in shock. I grabbed my gun... but it was my flashlight! I pointed it towards the noise. Something bared its fangs. It was a monitor lizard. A huge black one! It was crawling around the place with its long tongue stuck out. - It walked around... - George! Stop! Sir, may I... What the hell are you doing? I have orders to detain you. Are you willing to cooperate? Captain Man, you asshole. Motherfucker! One day, you'll thank me, friend. You fucking scum! Kamlai. Kamlai, how are you? Push. Come on. It's out! Push some more. What shall I call you? Are you sleepy? Are there more? Leesaw... Good, good, good. Looking for something? Get lost! You fascist. Piss off! Hello? Yes! I'm calling from her brother's house. One moment, please. Ma'am wants to know the purpose of your call. Well, her brother has disappeared from the house. Ma'am asks how long it's been. Well... He's been gone all day. He's been gone all day, Ma'am. Hello, my dear. How are you doing? Hello, I'm sorry to bother you this late. So, what do you mean to do, dear? Well... I think... I should call the police. No need for that. So... I'll have to go and find him myself, then. Don't be too alarmed. I'll try and see... what I can do. Damn! Look at that! What are you doing, uncle? Come with me, I'll take you home. - No, I don't want to go. - Come with us. - No. - Come on, uncle. Let go of me! Leave me be. Come on. Let go of me. Come on. Up. Let go. Come on, sit down. Sit down. All right, let's go. Watch him. Kamlai. Where shall I put the bowl? Come here, my lovely. How are you? What is it you want? No, don't do that. No, no, calm down. Put it in here. Business is okay, but not that good this month. Thank you. This is 15 baht, right? Yes, 15 baht. No bag, thanks. Thank you. Here's your change, thank you. Who are you? How did you get in here? Get out! - My name is Saw. - Stay away! I don't know any Saw. - My name is Saw. - Get out! Go away! My name is Saw. That's my father there! Leesaw. Champoon. Stay still. Please. No, stay still. Come on. Please. Dear distinguished guests, the temple staff will now take the body of the deceased to perform the cremation and the religious ceremony. Anyone who would like to come and pay their respects to the deceased and lay a sandalwood flower, please come up into the crematorium. My heart Everyone has the right to be loved No matter how far apart we are My heart can reach out to you My arms are open Waiting to embrace you lovingly Waiting for the day When we will really be together You come from far away But our hearts are joined as one Our love Is strong like none other Shining bright Like a diamond When I am kissed by you I am blessed and happy every day and every night I am blessed every day and every night New generation got a chance. Sweep everything clean. Downstairs, too. - Got your medication? - Yes. I got it.
