FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SAME WOMAN, FOUGHT OVER HER SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND PARTED WAYS ALL FOR NOTHING. THEY BOTH LOST HER. I SUPPOSE THAT IF ALL OF US HAD REALIZED THE RIFT WAS FOREVER THAT WE WOULD HAVE HANDLED OURSELVES A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. MISS MANDIE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEM BROTHERS LOVED DOIN' TOGETHER MORE THAN ANYTHING? WHAT? MAKING MUSIC. YES, MA'AM, AND THIS HERE HOUSE DONE BEEN DEPRIVED OF JOYFUL NOISE FOR TOO LONG. IT WAS MY HONOR TO BE INVITED TO THE SHAW MANSION TO HEAR THE BROTHERS PLAY THE ORGAN OR THE FIDDLE OR THE BANJO AND MR. JASON HERE, WELL, HE TAUGHT 'EM EVERYTHING THEY KNEW.

[CREAKING FLOOR AND FOOTSTEPS] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] (FATHER) WHISPERS SAY THAT THE INDIAN PRINCESS AND HER PREGNANT SISTER WERE GIVEN SHELTER IN A ROOM LIKE A CATHEDRAL WITH WINDOWS SO HIGH ONLY EAGLES COULD SEE THROUGH. MANY CHEROKEE PEOPLE LIVED TOGETHER IN THIS HIDDEN ROOM TUCKED AWAY INSIDE THE WALLS OF A GREAT MANSION. THE WHITE ARCHER, YOUNG THOUGH HE WAS, BUILT THE ROOM WITH HIS OWN TWO HANDS TO PROVIDE REFUGE FOR HIS CHEROKEE FRIENDS. THEY LIVED AS NORMALLY AS THEY COULD. THE MEN CLEANED THEIR RIFLES, SHARPENED BLADES AND TANNED THE HIDES THEY SHOT BY MOONLIGHT. THE WOMEN SEWED AND BEADED, WOVE BASKETS AND COOKED IN THE GREATEST FIREPLACE TALITHA HAD EVER SEEN. BUT HER FAVORITE THING ABOUT THE CATHEDRAL ROOM WAS THE SET OF ANTLERS CARVED FROM THE HEAD OF THE WHITE ARCHER'S SMELLY, DEAD DEER. [FLUTE MUSIC] DADDY TOLD ME THIS STORY A THOUSAND TIMES. HE NEVER SAID IT WAS REAL. [MUSIC] TALITHA CLOTHED HER NEPHEW, PAPOOSE IN FABRIC HER MOTHER HAD MADE, DYED FROM THE JUICE OF A CHOKEBERRY. FIFTY CHEROKEE ESCAPED THE TRAIL OF TEARS AND LIVED IN HERE FOR FOUR YEARS, NEVER SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY. IF THE ARMY HAD FOUND OUT, THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED YOUR GRANDPA AND EVERYBODY IN HERE. NOBODY EVER FOUND OUT. MY GRANDPA WAS IN THE ARMY. HE HATED INDIAN LOVERS. TALITHA'S FAMILY WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN SO SHE AND THE WHITE ARCHER STARTED THEIR OWN FAMILY AND PROMISED NEVER TO SEPARATE, EVEN FOR A DAY. I THINK I'M AN INDIAN. [WATER DRIPPING] [WIND BLOWING] [WATER DRIPPING] [BELLS RINGING] [MUSIC] I TOLD YOU WE WERE GOING TO THE CREEK. NOW WHERE DO YOU THINK THE WILL IS? I DON'T KNOW. [MUSIC] WHAT YOU LOOKIN' FOR?

YOU JUST CAN'T WEAR A LOPSIDED LOCKET. AHHHH! FINALLY SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE. YOU SURE DON'T LOOK A THING LIKE ETTA. AGAIN, SIDETRACKED, THE WILL. [MUSIC] THE TREASURE TRUNK'S GUARDED SECRETS, THE ANTLER NECKLACE PROTECTED SECRETS. BUT I ALREADY HAVE THE ANTLER NECKLACE AND IT'S NOT PROTECTING ANYTHING. MAYBE WE SHOULD CHECK THE CATHEDRAL ROOM.

NEITHER ME NOR IRENE LOOK A THING LIKE YA' AND THE ONLY REASON YOUR FATHER MADE ME PROMISE I WOULDN'T TELL IS SO THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD A REAL FAMILY. YOU MEAN YOU PUT ME THROUGH ALL THIS TROUBLE KNOWIN' FULL WELL SHE WASN'T YOUR FLESH AND BLOOD? JASON, WOULD YOU PLEASE ESCORT MR. AND MRS. SNOW OUT? WITH GREAT PLEASURE, SIR. THIS WAY.

THANK YOU, MADAM, AFTER YOU. GOODBYE MR. AND MRS. SNOW. [MUSIC] I CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER YOU LOOK MORE LIKE MY MOTHER OR ELIZABETH. THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE DEAD. WHO? ELIZABETH'S PARENTS. WHY? FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THEY SPLIT YOUR FATHER AND ELIZABETH UP AND ANNULLED THEIR MARRIAGE FIVE DAYS AFTER THEIR HONEYMOON. THEY FOUND OUT WE WERE HALF CHEROKEE AND THEY WERE NOT ABOUT TO LET INDIAN BLOOD DILUTE THEIR PURE GERMAN ANCESTRY. I WITH JIM SHAW MESSENGER COME WHEN BABY, YOU, MESSENGER SAY ELIZABETH DEAD IN CHILDBIRTH. GIVE YOU TO JIM SHAW. YOU KNEW THIS WHOLE TIME THAT ETTA WASN'T MY REAL MOTHER? I'M SORRY, PAPOOSE. HOW DO YOU GO 14 YEARS AND NEVER MAKE UP WITH THE ONLY BROTHER YOU HAD? I THOUGHT HE WOULD COME BACK AFTER HIS MARRIAGE WAS ANNULLED. SO I WAITED. HE WAS THE ONE WHO LEFT. HE TOOK ELIZABETH AND NED, I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT. SO I WAITED... TOO LONG. FATHER WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO YOU IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM TO COME BACK. WHAT HAPPENED TO ELIZABETH? I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T WANNA KNOW. JIM WAS PROUD OF HIS INDIAN BLOOD. I TOLD HIM TO HIDE IT, THAT IT'D GET HIM IN TROUBLE. HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PROUD OF MY INDIAN BLOOD OR NOT. I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT DEAD. [FOOTSTEPS] [MUSIC] HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO CLEAN UP THIS PLACE? DON'T ASK. MR. SHAW, WHERE IS YOUR WILL? -CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? -YES. -SURE. -NO. [MUSIC] JUMPIN' JIMINY. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] OF ALL THE PLACES. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] WHY WOULD ANYONE HIDE A WILL WHERE NO ONE COULD FIND IT? TO KNOW THAT, YOU COULD HAVE TO BREAK THE SEAL. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] I DON'T WANNA BE MAD ANYMORE. [THUNDER] MISS MANDIE. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] IF THAT AIN'T THE PRETTIEST DRESS THIS SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. OH, CHILD,HUSH UP NOW.

[MUSIC] [MUSIC] [DOOR BELL RINGING] LIZA, IF THAT'S A STRANGER DON'T OPEN THE DOOR. WE'LL ENDURE THE RINGING UNTIL THEY GO AWAY. WHO IS IT? [DOOR BELL RINGING] SUMMON MISS MANDIE AND MR. JOHN.
