** Those who look at East St. Louis from the outside... ...it would appear to be a dangerous place to live... ...possibly be the last place you would want to live. But for those who were born and raised here... ...it's home. ** Hey, McGrown. I'ma tell you like I just told -- Don't tell me you can do something, then come here and do the same, now. Don't tell me -- We just walked -- You gonna what? Hey, man. All right, I tell you what. Unh-unh, keep walking. Keep walking your ass out there. Keep walking. Keep walking. You saw how fast. Get this... right. Hey, chill out. Hey, hey, hey. Leave them pads alone. Just leave them pads alone. All right? What's the problem? What's the problem? Well, why you keep blowing your assignments? Stand up, and you tell your team why you can't learn your assignment so we can win a ball game! Mental effort. Everybody got the same excuse. - You can't process information? - I can. - What's six times six? - 12. Y'all see what we dealing with? That's crazy. That's processing information. That's the problem, right there. All that preseason hype, all right, means nothing if you can't prove it on the field. And the past three days, if that's how you want it, oh, this thing gonna be ugly. It's gonna be ugly. * Roses I walked in the corner with the body screaming "dolo" * There's one thing every last one of their coaches saying right now -- We dumb and undisciplined. We gonna make a mistake. That's all they preaching to their kids right now. * You already know though, You already know though * There ain't an idiot in this group. I guarantee you there's not. Get down that line and get big. You're in one of the worst communities in the country. * She might get it popping Yeah, we live this struggle every damn day. Halleujah, God. But when we come out here, we forget about it all. Down the sideline. 20, 10, touchdown. And we make a name for ourself. You tell me how you want your story found out in the end. Focus, then! That we're a bunch of undisciplined black kids in the inner city? Is that what we want? No, sir. Well, we need to change it. So, I'm asking every last one of you, man, how do you want your story told? * And I know you won't tell nobody nothing * * And I know you won't tell nobody no * * Roses KMJM-FM, Bridgeton, St. Louis. It's been a long time coming. STL's been asking for it. STL's got a new home for hip-hop and R&B. Welcome to the all-new 100. 3 The Beat, STL's hip-hop hub. Man 'Sup, there, y'all? I'm ain't nervous. Stop saying that. I got my boys next to me. I ain't nervous. STL's hip-hop and R&B is 100.3 The Beat. Oh, say, the dark secret -- we got the East St. Louis Flyers in the building. Fellas, go ahead and take a self and introduce yourselves. All right. 100.3 The Beat, this is State Street with Eastside here. We coming through Harvard to put East boogie back on the mountain, man. Yeah. Y'all know how we rock. All right. All right. That was nice. Come on, man. Come on. Come on, what you doing? They acting scared and stuff. I just get it right. All right, a bit. I'm getting comfortable now. Coach, I got to ask. You got an incredible story. You've done some amazing work, sent a lot of players on to the next level of play. It's -It's way bigger than me, as a coach, you know? I got into this thing to help young guys like myself, you know? I mean, you know, these guys I'm sitting with, we're, you know, we're both in the same -- we got the same type of background, you know? Like I say, I'm from Camden, New Jersey. - Camden? - And as you know, East St. Louis -- murder capital of the world. And that's my goal in life, now, you know, is to help everyone that I coach become a successful young man and have an opportunity to see things other than East St. Louis. Got to put a bag of something on the... Got to put a bag or something on them... Y'all can't just sit up there with them... out. Oh, okay. All right. All right. Take it easy. You know, most of the time, if you go with respect towards people, they'll give it back. You get a few that just, you know, "I'ma play the streets. I'ma act this way." Why are you not in school? Why are you not at school? But you're walking the street. Why you ain't washing the uniform? The sink work, don't it? The bathtub work, don't it? Monday, what you gonna do? And when you get there, what you gonna ask your teachers for? Are You sure? Go home, man. You stay that way, though. Yeah, there you go. He's 13. Fast, to be that big. I'm trying to talk him into playing football. He's never played football before. ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** You know, I help out where I can help out. On game days, I do my ripping and running and, you know, whatever they need. We push them out here so hard to the point that, when you have the opportunity to be great, you know it's your time to shine. East St. Louis begins on the road. They're going up to Chicago to take on Providence Catholic. ** Flyers, once again, one of the best in the area. They're ranked 4th in the state of Illinois in Class 6. Jeff Thomas has been a phenom, for four years, as a starter. He deserves All-American accolades. It's your time to face the man, no doubt about it. But Rayondous Estes is the strongest... on that football team. - Wow. - Wow. That football team feeds off of their quarterback. Now, you're saying the defense -- Lamontre Harvey, State Street. State Street is the hardest-hitting player to ever come through the East St. Louis football program And there's been a lot of them. Darren Sunkett, head football coach -- if you don't beat the big boys, they're never gonna respect you. I ain't saying a fluke win. I'm talking about beating them consistently. All right, we're gonna put you guys -- we're gonna get you to your locker room, all right? We got a cooler of water there, if you guys need some water or anything. Quarterback Rey Estes ready for another big season after last year cut short by that teacher's strike. Whiz, dawg, come here. Come on. You! ** Taking it at the 7 for the Flyers. ** ** ** Drive safe, everybody. Y'all making a statement, baby. That's my son, all the way. Turn it up. High five, high five. - Yeah. - Yeah? Did you say "yeah"? Dude, good touchdown, man. Hey, best luck in college. Congratulations. You had a great game. You did really good. Safe travels home. All right. There's a buzz around East St. Louis, so there'll be some scouts coming in. And I mean, like, a guy like Jeff, they already know about him. He's probably got about 20, 30 minutes of highlights. But for a guy like State Street, he's undecided, so that's... that'll be the disappointing part. If you're saying your goal is go to school, you have to separate yourself. So, every play has to be an aggressive play. Oh, man. You can't even see the top. I want to go into the NFL, but I mean... a lot of us don't have offers for real. And we just trying to figure out why. ** I'm 6 feet and everybody else is, like, 6'3", so they gonna go for the person that's taller. I got to play like I'm 7 feet just to show the recruiters that I'm good enough. Ah! Ah! And it seem like they look over me. Neither one of us had a father to show us the ropes, you know what I'm saying? Nobody in your family, nobody... Right. ...went to college. So, don't stop nothing. Just don't come back here. - I know. - Please, don't. I don't even want to come back here after college. Because then, you end up with four or five kids and a van. I know you don't want no van. All right. ** ** There you go. ** He athletic like that. You ain't never seen him run full speed and make a cut? That's Jeff Thomas. 'Cause, like, I know it's like every time -- Every time... That's Jeff Thomas, you hear me? That's Jeff Thomas. We are set for an exciting one today between the East St. Louis Flyers and the Cadets of CBC. Jeff Thomas, a sensational receiver. Every college -- major Division I college is after him. That's why he's an All-American. Announcer he has offers from Alabama and all the big schools. Yeah, the schools right in the area here from Missouri to Illinois are certainly after him. And the quarterback, Rey Estes, one accommodation, although Mizzou is hoping they can pull out both of those outstanding players. Everybody should just button up, 'cause this -- just an exciting one, end-to-end action with speed all over the field, here. Estes to throw. This time, he's got Thomas in the end zone, and it is caught! Touchdown! He's what you call "special." The Cadets are playing with a lot of emotions right now. Oh, my God! ** Lamontre Harvey, the defensive lineman they call "State Street." Do you think these guys know that college coaches are in the house tonight? And on the right side. Throws it up. And it is... caught! Announcer Oh, my goodness. Man, big-time players make big-time plays in a big-time game. ** ** Winning big games is not easy, all right? It's only gonna get tougher. Ain't nothing tougher than this circle. This is us. This is our family, and we gonna keep fighting. Let's get it, let's get it. Boom! Yeah! That's it. This is -- This all mine. Yeah, this is all mine, right there. I mean, I've read a couple of them, but all of them, like, just, basically, the same, for real. They just say the same stuff. I don't got the time to read all of them. I got this when I went to the Oregon camp. There was the top-5 times in the 40-dash, so they just put all us together on the line, we just raced, see who's the fastest. And I won. It was kind of surprising, but scary at the same time. Like, I got something to play for now. Jeff, right now, is, like, breadwinner to his family, almost. Go get it! He can't change being a kid. - Can you see it, Jeff? - Yeah, I can see. He's one of the tougher kids that we still can't completely figure out. 'Cause there's a lot going on with Jeff. Estes, in the project, we just being outside just throwing a ball to me, like, real deep. And I got to catch it, and like, if I drop it, I got to, like, get push-ups or run -- whatever they have you doing. And he's got a lot of secrets and a lot of hidden things that's in him. I believe he's witnessed some things that has forced him to internalize and find his comfort zone with being standoffish to hisself. And Jeff will push the envelope as far as he can push it. And it's scary for his future. The dynamics of his family is definitely... It's typical of an environment like this, a lot of the times. Hopefully, it becomes more important with the days coming. Because once it becomes important to Jeff, ain't no stopping Jeff. Well, this is the championship that we're going for again, so that's important. That's -- this year. So, it's time to put another one. That's where it's gonna go -- right there. The biggest part of coaching in our city is just, the kids hear so much how great they are from -- from -- you hate to say "meaningless people," but I mean, there's no other way to put it. You know, from people who don't actually know what they're watching when they're watching it, you know? You just see the end results. A lot of these kids just feel like they don't have to put the work in, and the team's gonna lay down for them 'cause of what they hear and what they read, when it's -- that's not the case. You know, you got to go out, you know, day in, day out, and prepare like the team you're about to face is the next state champion. Don't want to be complacent. He has a soft spot for kids, about getting the kids to the next level of life. And that's what I'm all about. Mnh-mnh. Just that simple. Then, I saw her one night, out, and she asked me out for a date. Darren, tell the truth. - Boom-boom. - Set the record straight. Who telling the truth? - Mommy. - See? Ah, that's my baby, there. Now, she a Rey fan, though. She dumped her daddy for Rey. And I'm so tough on Rey. Boy, you talk about... That kid knows how to piss me off, but man, I love him 'cause he's so -- he's so headstrong. Man, you got to stay out all night? You know that ain't right, don't you? I had a kid who was a teenager, and he's an adult now. I didn't put the time in, with my first child, that I should have. I guess that's one of the regrets I have in life that I got to deal with, and you know, I try to make up for it now. ...your mama, and like I said, she pissed. Did you talk to her yet? And she was pissed, right? Well, the junior year that I had was not the turn-out that I wanted. Going on strike, all that, like, that was crazy. Like, we hated that. Well, no school tomorrow for students in East St. Louis. Teachers are prepared to go on strike after failing to come to a contract agreement. Hardly a surprise in East St. Louis, where politics runs deep, sometimes at the expense of educating students. We want to graduate on time, we want our education, and we also want to save our season. There is no Friday-night football in East St. Louis tonight. The Flyers are forced to forfeit. By you taking our football season, it's like, what's there to do? ** Concerns about one of the students may surpass concerns about those striking teachers right now. Rayondous Estes, number 5 for the Flyers, remains hospitalized after a serious car accident. ** If we were in school, what happened to Rayondous wouldn't have happened. Estes was driving his mother's van in East St. Louis. He hit a parked car. The van spun into another, unspecified object. Estes was in and out of consciousness. Slow motion -- my life just started going slow at that point. Slow motion. I almost lost my life. ** ** I put a scare on a lot of people's faces and hearts and minds. And not just the team. Y-You talking about the community. There were 2,000 people outside that hospital every day. The first two nights, nobody went home. You know, kids get in trouble. He shouldn't have been driving. The school, the athletic program, is a safe haven. It keeps their mind on something positive. To this day, I still can't apologize. 'Cause I can't come out of my mouth and feel, like, you know, that's good enough. But I'll give you my word, I'm not gonna throw another pick. So, my actions got to speak louder than words. Well, then, why are you worried about it? That's the way I'm trying to pay them back. We can't go another year without giving the city no hardware. We can't. We've got to put something in the trophy case this year. I can't keep eating at no 10:30, dawg. We can't keep being eating at 10:30, then come to practice. Man, that's straight brunch. Bro. Bro. Don't you see us here bonding, bro? Take off your earphones. Bro, come take them out for me. Yeah, he ain't hisself. He ain't hisself. Throw him a Snickers, dawg. Have a seat, Rey. All right. Before we go start anything, I'm just gonna address the academics, gentlemen. We got one kid right now, he's ineligible. We have several kids right now that, you're one class away from being ineligible. State Street, where you at? You're failing African-American history. Nate Grant. You're failing choir. Every day that you walk in a classroom, every day you step between them white lines on a Friday night to perform, you're building your resume. Nobody's hiring or recruiting people and your resume don't add up. Rey, the most beautiful personality I ever coached -- great athlete. You'll never get there and reach your potential until you want to separate yourself from everybody else and want to be everybody's friend. Jeff, all the ability in the world -- your thing is mental. You'll never get there till you change that. I'm telling you. It costs $55,000 a year just to go to Mizzou. Who's playing here, right now,, got $55,000 a year to pay that? Hey, y'all see it every year. You see guys leave out of here without getting no scholarships. So, you can look to your left, look to your right, who's it gonna be? I went to a camp up north in Chicago. They had a lot of top-ranked players. I mean, they don't get noticed 'cause I feel like it's a politic game or something going around. My coaches, they gonna tell me... That's all you got to do, is just keep balling, eventually win a state -- win a state and ball a lot. You should have more offers coming in. We went on strike last year. So, we didn't have a season. Come here, State Street. - Yes, sir? - There he is, here. This is Lamontre. - Kevin Park. Lamontre Harvey. - How you doing? - I'm doing good. Good, man, good. What you weigh? Uh, right now, probably about 230. I lost a lot of weight, though, over the summer. Good, man. I look forward to watching you run around. All right. He'll be out there watching you. Go get dressed. So, he's leading the D-line in tackles for loss, sacks. Welcome aboard, everybody, to the Southwestern Conference match-up between East St. Louis and the Alton High School Redbirds. This is Jones, back to pass, looking, out of options! He is sacked by Lamontre Harvey! That's Harvey giving chase. Jones will scramble. He'll throw, and it's almost intercepted! Great effort by the defensive lineman. It's Estes out of the shotgun. Looking to his right, hit from behind! The ball pops loose. And a mad scramble for the football. The Flyers recover, but it looks like that's Lamontre Harvey down and injured on the field. - Here we go. - My ankle! I rolled on it. - Rolled on what, your ankle? All right. You good, State Street? All right, sock off. Have you hurt this ankle before? - No. And it hurts all right there? All over here. ** ** ** ** Rayondous -- Rey Estes. Oh. Will you fill this out for me? - M-I-Z! - Z-O-U! M-I-Z! ** - Where are you from? - East St. Louis. - No way. - Yeah. ** Nah, you can't -- No. A lot of Mizzou fans are saying to the quarterback, Rey Estes, "Hey, bring that Jeff Thomas down to Mizzou with you. Bring the other kid with you." ** What up, Coach? What's up with you? What's up? You all right? What's going on? You on your own? Yeah. - You come by yourself? - Yeah. Jeff called me earlier and said he'd come late. - Couldn't make it? - Yeah, 8:00. I don't know why. - Okay. All right. I'll be back here in a little bit. All right. Well, yeah, though, Jeff? All right, we're gonna get after 'em. We're gonna play aggressive on defense. Offense, we wan to run and gun and try to go get after their tail, all right? So, you can be a part of it. You can be the Missouri Tigers and go win in a national championship. M-I-Z. - Z-O-U. Awesome. Yeah. All right. Yeah, I seen film, but I doubt if it's still up there, though. See? Quite often, specifically when you're successful, kids start to relax and they think that they have arrived and they think they have gotten where they need to get to, And the reality is, they haven't. - Dude. - Mm-hmm? Hmm. So, if you get relaxed, complacent, things like that, then, bad things are gonna happen. Daddy, I want this phone. Not today. Maybe when you get State Street's age. Maybe Trey will buy you a phone. You gonna buy me a phone? When we make it to the NFL. - Yeah. - We'll buy you an iPhone. Right now. You'll get anything you want then. I got to get there first, so you got to stop being mean to me so I can get there. Okay. You're handsome. All righ-- You ain't ever told me that. Give me a kiss, then I know you being nice. Can I get a kiss? No. No. You're not gonna give me no kiss? Hey... They about to fight? ** ** What they trying to fight for? They jumped my little sister at school, though, today. They were fighting the other day at school. And they was trying to get to a .38. They was. There she go. They was gonna pop somebody. Being here, you ain't gonna make it. You either gonna be dead or in jail. It ain't too much you can do out here, for real. I came out, and he just said we were doing take-offs. I couldn't take off. You're taking off now. You're taking off for about 5, 6 weeks. "The Real Screw-ups of East St. Louis." "The Real Screw-ups of East St. Louis." Oh, he's got a high-ankle sprain. It's an injury that he's gonna have to play with. "What Could Have Been." That's what we'll call it -- "The Could've Been Story." You could've tricked somebody and became a ball player. It won't happen like that now. We'll put a memorial up for you. "Lamontre -- what could've been." ** ** Let's go. Kick-return team -- let's go. We up. Hey, Jeff, you ain't joining the return? They waiting on you. Estes drops back, looking long for Thomas down the sideline. It's incomplete. Pass incomplete, intended for number 4, Jeff Thomas. Estes, out of the shotgun. Goes deep for Thomas! They just look a little bit out of sync tonight. Jeff, where you at? Time-out time-out. Hey, Jeff, who pulled you out the game? Who pulled you out the game? Who? We don't know what that means. Sit him the rest of the game. He's done. ** All-American wideout Jeff Thomas not with the offense right now. Not sure what the reasoning is behind that. Now, it looks like Coach Luehmann is talking to the officials over on the Granite City sideline. All right. All right. All right. Shake them up. ** Looking at the camera. Sit up. Nice. Here we go. Hey, I like that one better. Boom. They'll like that. There you go. There you go. Y'all got me washing cars, though. I need the bucket. Donate, donate, donate, donate! Donate, donate, donate! East St. Louis is just steamrolling through the conference right now, and the good news just keeps getting better. They got one of their best defensive players back -- Lamontre Harvey. Don't let these... you up. They scared. Yo, you see that crowd? Look at the crowd, bro. They scared. Let's go. Get in there! Get in there! ** Let's go! Let's go! Yeah! You lost! No work! They can't hang with us. They can't hang with us. Announcer all night, really. Fake the toss sweep, he rolls to his right, throws right. Got Thomas, but it's out of his reach. Incomplete. Hey, I got your back. I got your back, Rey. I got you, Jarrell. I got you. I got you. I got you. Hey! Come in, defense. Defense, come here. Let me ask you something. Are y'all gonna let these guys in the end zone and kill this game? Well, let's go. Come on, ref! Let's get it going! Announcer "We might not get the ball again, so we have to score a touchdown." Get your hands up! Dickmann swings it back to the left. Tipped into the air. Intercepted! It could be 6 the other way! Inside the 20, all the way to the 10, and into the end zone! Touchdown, Flyers! - I saved the day. - Yeah, yeah. I saved the day. ** Great job, defense. I challenged you. You stepped up. All right, so, hey, here's the schedule for next week, all right? And I don't want to hear nobody trying to skip out on this thing, all right? Now, we know we got some people with some academic problems, right? They're in trouble. Monday and Tuesday, gentlemen, we're gonna have mandatory study hall, all right, in the library. Without the state championship, you gonna get that scholarship, right? I know you ain't made your decision on where you're going. But you got some great offers. I mean, I know you know that. But you got to take care of your business, so you gonna miss this game. And you gonna be able to support the team the whole time, all right? All right, you got -- Man, these people -- these kids looking up to you. You know that? - Yeah. So you got to take care of your business. Me and Harvey, we talk about this all the time. When Dr. Hanson came and offered me the job and wanted me to come take over and try to rebuilt it... What we have? We had 17 guys? 17 guys, man. A lot guys told their kids don't come play football, you know? Cut the grass ourself, Coach Anwood, he come out there 5:00 in the morning painting the field, cutting the grass for us. - With a paintbrush. - With a paintbrush. Oh, wow. Back then, those 17... Would run through a brick wall. ...would run through a brick wall. They buy in. The stuff Jeff doing, he's got -- I love him death. You can call me and ask me for anything. But he's a bad teammate. And it's putting us in a bad situation, 'cause all of the kids see it. The offense is built around Jeff Thomas. Without him, we not gonna win, period. When Jeff's not there, well, Rey kind of doubts hisself. Neither one of you can be a star without each other. You got your brother's back. You got your brother's back. You got your brother's back. And that's what it's all about, all right? We got your back. You should have our back. Yep. Throw the ball, Rey. What the... What are you waiting on? All this directing traffic. Gator right, 18 zone. This kid here, man. This kid -- you don't know what you're gonna get from him, man. I forgot, they can't play without Jeff, though. I forgot, my quarterback can't play without Jeff. Jeff his bailout guy, 'cause you ain't moving the ball without him. You can thank them 'cause you can't do it without 'im. Offense, let's go. You're going to mess around, man. You gonna lose your full ride, dude, with that kind of junk. This was a sloppy game by East St. Louis. They're gonna walk away with a win. The players will feel good about it, but the coaching staff won't feel great. You can shake your head all you want. You made it true. Wake the hell up! Get out that... daydreamin'. They're asleep, dawg. Wake up! ** Get on the ground. Get on the ground! Drop the gun! 1032, he just dropped it. He a juvenile, too. 1029, check on a black male. This is one of the ones that should've been out here playing football, but he chose to run the streets, and no matter how many times you give him a break, he don't understand. Oh, here he go. Y'all just stepped over it. 1032, recover. .38 special. Are y'all recording this because we doin' our job or y'all just being funny? Which one's your son? The yellow, bright one. - Mario. - Mario. - Oh. - Probably got a tongue on 'im. Oh, I know Mario real well. I kind of figured you did. It's not pretty. Y'all aren't tryin' to... You all are doing your job. Looks safe to me. Looks good to me. Clean up the city. Do your job. Looks good. Mario won't listen. He's still want to hang with these ones that doin' bad. You got to stop him from hangin' who he hang with. And I've been trying. You got to keep him in the house, keep him in the house. They ain't go nothing -- they ain't go nothing but send him up the river. But I hope he learns his lesson before it's too late. Hey! ** The only thing stopping Jeff Thomas is Jeff Thomas. "The Great Gatsby" is the next novel that we're going to dive into. We can only do so much. You know, we can knock on the door. We can go get him. We've done that. We went a whole semester picking him up every morning, and you still get the door shut in your face sometime. "No, Jeff's not going to school." "Jeff's not here," but we know Jeff's there. You know, if I came to work two times a week and missed three, you're fired after a certain period of time. I'm out here trying to bust my tail trying to get on the level where he at. If I was in his shoes, I'd be the happiest man in the world. ** Which way you want to go? What do you want to do with your life? How do you want Jeff Thomas to be remembered? Jeff Thomas take care of business in the classroom, Jeff Thomas is a potential millionaire in 2, 3 years. Man Man Yeah. It's real simple, gentlemen. State championship teams don't act like this. Until you guys are ready to control your... we're not gonna waste our time doing it. I know what it takes to police your team, and the leaders on this team are not doing it. So, hey, we gonna call it a day. We'll come on back Wednesday. Tomorrow, we gonna take us the day off. We gonna show you just how it feels. Y'all don't even deserve to sit in this here City of Champions circle, 'cause this ain't how champions act. Let's go. Clear the field. Y'all talk that way. - That's dumb. - Can't do nothing for real. We can't get in contact with Jeff. His phone broke. We just got to talk. We got to wait till we catch him in person. But y'all got practice. Y'all got a game Friday. We don't have to practice. If y'all really want to practice, if y'all's was really dedicated, y'all will go out there on that field by yourself. - Y'all don't care enough. - No, they don't. - They just sitting -- - Y'all just sitting around. Y'all don't -- Y'all don't want it. Y'all don't want it. Y'all don't want it! Thing is getting them to realize what it takes to win a state title, the importance of it. We as coaches can talk till we're blue in the face. If it doesn't register with those guys, you know, we're not gonna advance very far anyway. ** ** All the seniors over there by Coach Sunkett. All the seniors over there. Hey, yo, go over there and talk that stuff out with y'all Coach, man. Since y'all went and organized yourselves, get yourselves together. First order of business is why we all got him here. Y'all need to vote Jeff Thomas off this football team and then believe that you can go ahead and win this... thing without him. And I'm telling you my opinion. He's BS'd his team for three years in a row doing what he wants to do, and I don't care what y'all think. I never seen a guy on that status just say, "To hell with this team, school, whatever." Second order of business is you guys never win unless you had to get your organized team, that's obvious. As it's quarterback, you can organize your guys. Championship teams don't act this way. Y'all got a lot of places y'all can go, but being here up in our face ain't doin' nothing right now. ** ** ** Can we talk to you? Yeah, what's up? We want you to come back there. ** ** Everybody saying you want out of East St. Louis, right? You want out for a minute, right? Everybody in this group, that's what you want? So if this is the avenue to get it down, if you're not putting the right foot forward, how you gonna get it done? I mean, how are you gonna get it done? Ask yourselves that question. And it's crazy -- a bunch of y'all got kids, so what you raisin' your kid to be? You want your kid live that life? You want your daughter's to risk getting acid thrown on her, her face scratched up, any them things? You want your son getting jumped on, Markevion? But who's tryin' to make a difference for 'em? And you're never gonna get away from it, 'cause your parents, they probably still there, you aunties, your uncles, your grandparents -- they all still there. But don't mean you can't better yourself. Now, what are you gonna do? You gonna utilize your gift? Or we stuck right here? "Coach Sunkett, man, he be trippin'. He stay on our ass." We stay on your ass for a reason. We hoping y'all want it. Hoping you want it. ** ** ** Get it down, get it down, get it down! Touchdown. You know, I'm just happy for the guys right now. This is something that they really looked forward to, and they accomplished that. Now it's time for us to move on to the playoffs. Holla at you boys, 979, 104.1 on the East Side. Hey, man, we doing a tribute to the East St. Louis Flyers. I mean, this team's looked great all year, but these Illinois State playoffs are a gauntlet. Those teams are good, and they're playing with the big boys. What, it's Class 7A? - Yeah. - Hell yeah, boy! They got through first-round game against Lincoln without really breaking a sweat, but they've got by far the toughest game of the playoffs coming up with that powerhouse from Glenbard North here in the second round. All right, watch yourself. One hit changed... whole complex about this damn game. Football is a mentality. Got his teeth damn near knocked out. He don't want to block nobody else. He feeling around. Hey, I'm telling you -- contact don't hurt, man. I don't hurt like that. Watch you feel around. Tell me, you teach this coach. Contact don't hurt, man. Hat in hands. Hello? ** Come on. Let's go out here and have a good practice. We understood? Yes, sir. Dang. These guys are something else. ** Tight in, Ocho. Down. Right there. Right there. Right there. Come on, again. Let's go. Eyes up. Stay up. Ho! Right there. Let's see it again. ** He not going to play, so he might well get used to playing it. ** ** Come here, boy. Come here, Joe. Relax. - Who, man? - Huh? - Who. - Your cuz, man. - Who? - I'll let your people tell you? Who? Who, man? What, you just got a text? Some girl just texted me. - Come on, it'll be all right. - Who? Come on, let your granny tell you. That's why she up here. She ain't want nobody else to tell you. You understand? Hm? Come on, let's walk. ** Come on, we got you, big dog. You know that, right? You know, you got to be strong for your mama. You know what I'm sayin'? For your granny. You got to be strong enough for them. I wouldn't tell 'im. I wanted y'all to talk to him. He said, mommy, you lying. Shreina, how you going to drive? That's why I told you not to come. She can't drive. You good? Come here, girl. You all right? - I'm all right. - Need somebody to drive you? They cousins, and they just, like, best friends. That's all, man. ** It's crazy here, man. Yeah, man. Mm, mm, mm. We don't know exactly, but they just said he'd been in a car accident. Like, everybody on the football team knew 'im. Like, we was hanging around with 'im outside of school and all that. He was 16. 17, I don't know. More tonight about a police pursuit that ended with a crash in Illinois. Police say the suspect in the car is dead and is only 17 years old. Man this deadly crashed started as a police chase. Woman before crashing into a light pole near the intersection of 18th and Baugh. The impact was so hard, it snapped the pole in half and fell onto the car. Man When the officers approached the vehicle, the vehicle took off at highway speed. ** ** I just want to... experience more... before, like, I die, whatever. So I can just see what's really out there. 'Cause I know there's more than what... what -- what this 89 blocks give, so... ** I've seen this, like, too much, y'all. I don't want to see this, man. We all better than this. We all don't got nothing. We all don't got nothing. We all tryin' to have somethin'. We all trying to have somethin'. I don't want to see no... more names on the concrete. I don't like seeing T-shirts, man. This is real, kids. Y'all don't know 'cause y'all so lost in this Instagram and Facebook. Can y'all hear me? Raise your hand if you can hear me. Hear the candle, y'all. This is for my nephew, Kychaun. He ain't comin' home, y'all. My heart is breakin' tonight for every mother that has lost a child, for every sibling that has to wake up without their sister or their brother. We are a black people. We are strong people. We have to let go of our pride. If you want to rep East St. Louis, rep... that people want to come and see what's happenin' in East St. Louis, that God comes in and transforms East St. Louis. This is how real life feels, y'all. Please, can y'all help me protect our city that we say is so good, that y'all say y'all gonna die about. I was the street so they wouldn't have to be. Let's go. Oh, my Kychaun! I will lose my voice so y'all can have one. ** Everything happen right now. No, we do it right here. Let's go. - This is about heart, here. This is about heart, here. - Mm-hmm. - You understand what I'm sayin'? This is -- As he always rest in peace and all that, what would your boy want you to do? What would your boy want you to do? It is round two of the Illinois Class 7A State Championship playoffs. - Here you go. - Undefeated East St. Louis draws by far their toughest test of the season. It's Glenbard North, a top-10 team in the state, athletes all over the field, and they're playing their best football at the right time. Flyers will get the ball first. Thomas and Hall back deep to receive. You got the edge. Hit it. All right, you're tight. A little side screen to Thomas. Nice catch. He'll make a move upfield and lost the football! It's on the turf, and Glenbard will recover. They got us going, man. Conway out of the shotgun. Looking deep left. He's got a man in the end zone. Caught! Touchdown, Panthers. You ain't aggressive!

Nobody home, he'll walk into the end zone. Touchdown, Flyers. Well, you can't say they've played their best today, but Rey Estes has come up huge to keep the Flyers in this game. Somebody stretch Rey out. Jimmy John, we got to get stops. Right, we got to. We need one more big play from you guys. One more, come on. Bates, number 3! Bates! Conway out of the shotgun. Flyers seem to have some trouble lining up here. Ball is snapped, and there's nobody covering Newsome! Touchdown, Panthers! You got to be kidding me, man! ** ** Hey, hey, hey. We got to to hold them here. Come on, you're good. We gotta hold them here, baby. We good, bro. We gotta hold them here. Come on. Let's go, Rey. - Come on, Rey. - This you right here, baby.

If we don't get it done on this one, it's over with. This is what we're made out of. This is what we're made out of. ** It's Estes, looking to his right. Now tucks and runs. Scrambling to the right side, but he will be sacked. Rey, just take a three-step drop and throw the damn ball. They got to get on the ball. It's 4th down. Clock is still running. 4th down and 20 yards to go. Man, we just blew this. Man, this is crazy. - Give me some time, line! - Let's go! This is it, folks. Last chance for the Flyers. Glenbard showing pressure. They bring it. Estes from the shotgun. Has a man down the middle! Yes, he got it! On the ball! On the ball! - Come on! - Come on! On the ball! Rey, Jeff, let's go. Now Estes, up top. He wants it all. Thomas, in the end zone! Batted away. ** ** Hey, listen to me. We're going to run skinny routes, all right? We're going skinny routes. Eat this guy outside. Let's go get it. Rey, you got to get rid of it. Scramble this way if you got to. ** ** - Touchdown! - Yes! And it's a touchdown, East St. Louis! ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** Talk to Jeff. Good job, fellas. I lov -- I love y'all. I can't begin to tell all you men just how proud I am of you. All right? You guys never quit. Hey, man. 'Cause I don't get choked up like this. We knew this was gonna be our toughest opponent. Anyone think I'm crazy? Hey, man, we had two angels on our side watchin' over us tonight. You know that, don't you. - Yes, sir. His granddaddy and our little homey, gentlemen. We have two angels watchin' over us, all right? Come on. Clap that thing up. Hey, Coach Sunk, sun then came out. - Huh? - Sun then came out.
