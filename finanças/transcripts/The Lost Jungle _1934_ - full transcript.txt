[roars] [instrumental music] [elephants trumpeting] [growling] Get up there, get up there or I'll break every bone in your body. 'Get up there. You hear me?' I don't think so much of him. Oh, he couldn't even train animal cracker. [male #1] '...gonna do what I tell ya. Get up there!' You'll never get that cat to do that trick. You don't handle him right. I don't, eh? Open up that chute. I'll show this baby who's boss. Come on, come on. Come.. Hip! 'Get in there.' [growling] [roars] 'Don't you snarl at me or I'll knock' 'every tooth out of your head.' [snarls] [grunts] [Clyde] 'Get up, Sharkey.' If I ever catch you mistreating any of my animals again you're through, understand? The cat went for me. Honestly it did, Mr. Beatty. I had to teach him a lesson. That's no excuse. I do all my things without beating the animals up. - You'll have to do the same. - Well, I'm sorry, uh. Won't happen again. I-I guess I had it coming. It's alright. Let's forget it. [roars] Gee, imagine that guy telling me how to train animals. I forgot more than he will ever know. Just the same. You'd like to have a job, wouldn't you? Ah! [dog barks] How'd you like to have that one, huh? Better get that pup out of here, sonny. Well, my lions might chew him up. Don't worry. He ain't afraid of lions. Are you, Spot? He looks like a fighter. Maybe it's a good thing my lions are safe in their cages. Look out! He'll bite you. Gosh, you're a swell animal trainer, Mr. Beatty. - You wait here. - Yes, sir. No, dad, you stay here. - I'll talk to Clyde. - I'd better go. - You'll be afraid to speak up. - Please! But, Ruth, you've known about this trip for a month. Why didn't you settle all this with Clyde before? 'Last week, last night.' I will now, dad. I-I'm a little new to this. I just don't know how to begin. Well, that's no problem. Come right out and state the facts. Tell him I'm sailing for the South Seas and that I refuse to leave you in port unless you're married. Oh, I couldn't do that. That will be just like asking him to marry me. That's what you're here for, isn't it? If it isn't, then I'll drop in the hint. I'm not scared of that lion tamer. I'm not afraid either, but.. ...Clyde's afraid of me. What? He's different from other men. He's spent his whole life with animals. He doesn't understand. Sure, seems that after two years of courting he'd find out whether or not he wanted to marry you. He has. I know he wants to marry me. Ruthy, are you sure about him? Absolutely. Very well. Get along. You've just 15 minutes. And if he can't make up his mind in that time tell him goodbye and we'll sail for the Tropics. Good morning, Miss Robinson. Hello, Larry. This is my father. Father, this is Larry Henderson, publicity man for the whole circus, especially for Clyde. How do you do? I'm certainly delighted to meet you, Capt. Robinson. I know your daughter well. - She and Clyde Beatty-- - I know all about that. Tell me, is this man Beatty afraid-- Afraid? Listen, captain. Clyde Beatty isn't afraid of man, beast nor devil. I think I better talk to that young man. Father. Is Clyde in? - Could I see him? - Certainly. Why not? You can see Clyde at any time. I'll take you to him. [lions roaring] Hey, Clyde. Your new lion is here. Good, I'll try him out right away. You better let him alone until he's had time to cool off. They're all bad at first. We might as well get acquainted now as anytime. Can we watch the training, Mr. Beatty? Alright, if you're sure you'll hang on to Spot. I don't wanna take any chances. Don't worry, I won't let him get at your lion. Get out there. Get him now. Oh, Clyde. 'There's someone to see you.' I'm glad to see you. No one has to tell me when three is a crowd. I hope you don't mind my [indistinct] on you like this. Mind? No, why should I? I thought maybe you were busy. I am. Awfully busy today. 'Just got a new lion.' I-I was hoping I could.. ...see you alone for a few minutes. [lion roaring] I really should leave. But something has come up that.. ...you should know about. What is it? Well, it's terribly important, Clyde. I.. [Sharkey] 'Open the door.' What were you saying? It's too big to tell all at once here in front of these people. Can't we go outside? Alright, but I'll have to keep an eye on the men. New lion, you know, can be a roar on the first day. [Sharkey] 'Clyde, we can't let him out of the cage' but he ain't takin' it well. - But, Clyde. - Just a minute, honey. You don't understand. I have to give dad my answer. [Sharkey] 'Hurry, Clyde. It'll tear itself to pieces.' He's sailing and he wants me to-- Alright, alright. Whatever you say. I've gotta look after that cat. [lion snarling] Uh, won't you wait and see Clyde break in his new lion? No, thank you. Dad will be getting impatient. We're sailing today. - Sailing? Where to? - The South Seas. He's chartered to Professor Livingston. An expedition. Oh, yes. But you're not going along? I don't want to, but.. Now I have no choice in the matter. [lion roaring] Alright, Joe. Hold it, Joe. That's close enough. [roaring] [trumpeting] [Clyde] 'It's time for the rope.' Alright, Joe. It's gonna need more room. Take it easy, old boy. We're not gonna hurt you. [roaring] I'll try and get him down to the chute and be sure you hang on that rope. I'll take care of this. What are you gonna do? Shoot the lion? No, these are just blanks, but the lion doesn't know it. [roaring] If you gentlemen will excuse me. Sure. Ready. - All set, Clyde. - Okay, start him down. [indistinct shouting] Look out, Clyde! Coming through. We've gotta get a hold of that rope. We got it. Hey, you kids, get away from there. Give me that. Now beat it. [gunshot] [gunshots] [cocks empty gun] [growls] Here, Mr. Beatty. Mr. Beatty, here's your gun. [gunshots] That's enough for today, boys. Gee, that was a close call. Sure glad you got out of that, Clyde. Sharkey stumbled. He couldn't help it. I sort of stumbled myself a minute ago. It was a lot of hard work to bring that lion for my new act. But he's worth it. Are you alright, Mr. Beatty? The lion didn't hurt you, did he? Gosh, I was scared! You got nothing on me. Thanks, sonny. I sure needed that gun. Oh, if my dog had been here you wouldn't need a gun or nothing. [laughs] Why don't you two try and get along? We'll get along, alright. You've gotta let them know who is the boss from the start or you're through. Looks to me like you're through already. Don't kid yourself. From now on, it's gonna be smooth sailing. Sailing is right. Boy, she was plenty mad when she sailed out of here. She? What are you talking about? Ruth. Oh, is she gone? And how? I guess I was a little abrupt. But I'll see her tonight and patch things up. Then you didn't know she's going with her father. - What? - They're sailing today. - But she can't. - But she is. Hey, Clyde. You better be careful. Remember, Ruth isn't a lion. [foghorn blaring] Professor, what is this Kamor you're setting out to find? I believe that Kamor will prove to be the real cradle of civilization. - Is it an island? - Probably. Well, how will you know when you've found it? When I find an island bearing the fauna of both Africa and Asia I'll know I'm pretty close. Fauna? What's fauna? Animals. Lions, tigers.. ...and cub reporters. Alright, Ruth, we're sailing. 'Come along, Ruth.' [foghorn blares] Where's Captain Robinson's schooner, the Mary R.? Gone. Just shoved off for the South Seas. Boy, I'll be glad when this rehearsal's over. What are you worrying about? The closer I get to this mixed animal act the more it gives me the willies. I'm not worrying about it. I know you're not and that's what's worrying me. Since Ruth ran out on you, you're taking too many chances. - That's my business. - Business? It's suicide in the first degree. You can't put lions, bears, tigers and panthers all in the same cage. The big ones will eat the little ones and those that don't get enough to eat will eat you. Clyde, you're the greatest animal trainer in the world. - But-- - Don't tell me, tell the world. You'll admit the act has swell publicity angles. Well, it's stupendous. Boy, I got the swellest idea for a poster. - Listen-- - Tell that to the boss. [drum roll] The most vicious man killers have been assembled under one roof will now be worked together in the big cage for the first time in any circus by the world's greatest animal trainer Mr. Clyde Beatty. [band music] Boss, I got a swell idea for the posters. It's colossal. Now up here in this corner we'll have ten lions coming out of a thick jungle. - No, 30 lions. And over here-- - Just a minute, Henderson. Suppose we wait to see if Clyde's act is as good as he says. Here they come. [roaring] Hush! [chuckles] Playful little fellas. What I'm worried about is what's gonna happen when the tigers get in there. What did I tell you? [elephant trumpets] [Clyde] 'Alright, let the lions in.' Just wait till Tommy gets in there. Yeah. [indistinct] Come on. [indistinct shouting] [applauding] It's a success. Dilettante's the biggest thing Clyde's ever done. Boy, watch my smoke. What did I tell you? Break it. Tommy. Tommy, Nelly! Hey, Tommy! That boy sure knows his stuff. And it's a good thing for him that he does. [laughs] Well, how did you like the show? I loved it, Clyde. But I'm afraid you'll never be able to keep those two in the same ring. Don't worry, Mr. Maitland. By the time this season's over, they'll be kissing each other. [laughs] [band music] [audience applauding] - Great work, Clyde. - Great? Why, it's stupendous, colossal. Greatest act in the history of the show business. - Clyde, you're a-- - Thanks. What's the matter with him? Worry. Ruth's been gone three months and Clyde hasn't heard a word from her. [wind howling] [indistinct shouting] [screaming] [indistinct chatter] Hmm. Plenty of good timber, anyway. - Timber? - For spars to repair the ship. From what I just saw, that'll take months. If anyone of my carrier pigeons can get through to a settlement, some ship can pick us up. Hm, I wouldn't count on pigeons. I tell you, professor, we'll be here until we get the Mary R. patched up and afloat. Or until we're all eaten by jungle beasts. Maybe, but let's get going. I'm worried about Ruth. You'll have him up and going in no time, Miss Ruth. I hope so. - What happened to you, Slade? - Nothing much, sir. I was lucky, but old Pat's dead. Killed? We were cutting brush, there was a roar and a lion just tore him to pieces. Lion? The biggest one I ever saw. Ripped Pat clean down the middle before he could wink. Are you sure it was a lion? I guess I know one when I see it. [lion roars] There he is now. What's that sound like to you? [roaring] Now I'm positive we are on the island of Kamor. There's no other place in the world where lions and tigers could be found in the same jungle. Think of the sensation this will cause in the scientific world. Yes, if they ever hear about it. Don't you think we could repair the wireless? There's nothing left to repair. Ruth, get me a pigeon. It's our only hope. While you're waiting on that full bird we'll all be eaten by these cats. Mr. Kirby, round up the crew. We're going to build a stockade. Aye aye, sir. They're over half gone. Oh, maybe this will be the lucky one. Goodbye, precious. If you see Clyde, tell him.. ...tell him, I love him. Please, don't fail me. [reading in foreign language] [male #2] 'What have you got there?' [speaking in foreign language] [keys clacking] Gentlemen, Livingston has found Kamor! - I never thought he would. - What does it say? It's from our consulate Zuba. He cables that he received a message by a carrier pigeon from Professor Livingston notifying him that the expedition was shipwrecked upon the island of Kamor. It's been a great season, Clyde. In fact, we've had several great seasons. Yeah, but the public will expect an even bigger thrill next year. And I don't see how you're gonna give it to them. You can figure that out for me. I'm going to the jungle for some wild animals. You mean, shoot 'em? - No, bring 'em back alive. - Stupendous. But, uh, where are you going, Clyde? Oh, India for tigers and Africa for lions. [male #3] 'Extra, extra. All about Professor Livingston.' 'Giant airship goes to rescue.' 'Livingston's shipwrecked in the South Seas.' 'Read all about it. Paper?' Hey, boy. Let's have one. You suppose Ruth is still with 'em? Do you see anything about her? No, nothing. That's where I'm going. - Where? - Kamor. What an idea? Why didn't I think of it myself? It's colossal. Forward publicity. What are you talking about? Guess this, Clyde's going after Ruth. But we can kill two birds in one stone. Why, the place must be full of animals. Can't you see the headlines? Beatty Brings Them Home From Kamor. Primeval Animals From A Primitive Place. He Takes From Wild And Trains Them. - Where is Kamor? - Oh, who cares? It's full of lions, tigers and the Lord knows what else. Every passenger on that airship will be front-page news for the next six months. Maitland, you've got to get Clyde on that ship. - And me too. - But, uh, but, uh-- Never mind the buts, get me on that ship. [airship droning] [instrumental music] It must take a lot of nerve for a man that went to a cage with wild animals. It sure does, doctor. And, uh, I've had many a narrow escape. Hm, you work in Mr. Beatty's act? Well, not exactly, but, uh, I'm always standing by in case anything happens. Beatty never makes a move without me. Why, I taught him everything he knows. There's that guy Sharkey running off with the mouth again. I can't understand why you brought him along on this trip. Will you hold the other end of the rope while I'm taking a live tiger out of the trap or putting a scared lion into a cage? Who, me? Ha! Not on your life. Well, that's why I'm taking Sharkey along. [male #4] 'Hey, extra! Here you are, Mister! All about the Victory' 'Giant airship sighted far at sea.' [man on radio] 'A wireless dispatch from the Victory reports' 'that the dirigible already nearing its goal' 'has encountered a low pressure area.' 'This generally means hurricanes at this time of the year.' 'No alarm need be felt, reads the dispatch' 'because the ship is built to withstand any kind of weather.' 'It is expected that ground crews will be landed' 'by the special gear carried on the Victory' 'and the Livingston party contacted' 'within the next 48 hours.' I'll take this last pigeon, just in case. How long do you expect to be gone this time? Oh, not much more than a week. The ship will be repaired before that. And then I'm going to have trouble. You mean the men? They've endured some terrible hardships. They're frightened of those wild animals. It'll be hard to hold them here-- Yes, but we can't go until I finish my expedition. I'm sure the cradle of civilization lies somewhere on this island. Don't you realize the importance of the discoveries I expect to make? Yes. But I also realize the seriousness of mutiny. Pretty soon, there won't be any of us left. And the professor's talking of staying on until he finds that buried city. He can stay by himself. I'll be back as soon as possible. Good luck. - Goodbye, Ruth. - Goodbye. How much farther? Those hills. I want to make it tonight if I can. I hope that killer lion ain't followin' us. Who? Sammy? [chuckles] I hope he is. [growls] Better let me go across first. [roars] [screaming] [lion growls] [man screams] [indistinct chatter] [thundering] [wind howling] [thundering] I don't think this idea's so hot after all. Oh, there's nothing to worry about. That's merely your personal opinion. For goodness' sake, let's have some music. Something's happened to the radio. The lightning struck it. - Radio's gone dead, sir. - Check the antenna. We're being blown off our course, sir. Dump the rest of the ballasts. [passengers clamoring] [clanking] Captain, the ship's breaking up. [passengers clamoring] Check the other sections and report back to me. We're falling. [clanking] [male #5] 'There you are, mister. All about the big disaster.' We've learned nothing regarding the disappearance of the dirigible Victory. Have you seen the late editions? It says here, "The Naval Board of Enquiry "holds that due to their construction "any part of the newer airships will tend to free-balloon until its gas cells are entirely deflated." And that means? If the Victory broke up as did the Akron then we can hope that some free-ballooning section may still be in the air. [male #6] '...course dinner.' 'We started eating before we even went' 'into the banquet room.' They served delicious appetizers of caviar. I passed up the soup and the fish and a lot of other things 'because I wanted to save my appetite' 'for the roast turkey.' You never saw such a turkey in all your life. It was stuffed with chestnuts 'and served with cranberry sauce' 'sweet potatoes, plenty of giblet gravy.' 'And for a side dish' ...they had barbecued ham with raisin sauce. You'll pardon me if I don't stay for dessert. But after ten days of crackers, I'm sure that blackberry pie would give me a stomach ache. How did he know we had blackberry pie? He didn't have to guess. You've told us about the banquet at least 20 times. Look over there! Land! [Clyde] Why, it's an island. The wind is carrying us toward it. [male #7] 'It's all covered with jungle.' At the rate we're traveling, we'll be over the island in no time. [Clyde] 'Can't we bail out in parachutes?' [male #7] 'There aren't any, they were lost' with the other part of the ship. Is there any way we can land? Well, we can let the gas out but there's no way of controlling the ship. You mean we might crash? [male #7] 'Well, anything is better than staying up here' and starving to death. Let's take a chance. [gas hissing] The valve's broken. The gas is escaping too fast. We're heading straight for the island. We're bound to crash. [animals growling] [thundering] Clyde. Clyde! [snarling] - Larry. - Are you alright, Clyde? I guess so. Gee, I'm glad. You're not hurt, are you? Me? Hurt by a little drop like that? [laughs] Have you seen anything of the others? No, I wonder what happened to 'em. Sharkey! Doctor! Hey, Howard! Where are ya? We better start searching for them. No use yelling anymore, Larry. Howard and the doctor. Just think, Clyde. 'It might have been us.' They weren't as lucky as we were. But I don't see anything of Sharkey. Ah, it would suit me swell if we never saw that guy again. Oh, Sharkey's not such a bad fella. We've gotta find him if he's still alive. [man groans] Don't kill me. Don't kill me. I'll go away. I won't touch the treasure. 'I swear.' Treasure? Take it easy, old man. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Water. Water. My canteen's over there. [gasps] You're not one of the ship's crew. Ship's crew? What do you mean? The ship that brought me here. Head down for the stockade. We should go down there and tell Captain Robinson that I've found.. Treasure? Yes. The treasure of Kamor. - Where is it? - 'It's here.' The man that attacked me was guarding it. He must be the only survivor of the lost tribe of Kamor. But...what.. What's become of it? Where is he? In there. In the pit? With the crocodiles? But what am I to tell Captain Robinson? Where is the treasure? It's in the.. A coconut. Hey, what's the idea? Look out, here comes another one. [chattering] Thanks, pal, come down and have lunch with us sometime. Yeah, and bring your own coconut. [chatters] That's service for ya. Lunch is ready. [sighs] Uh, do you mind if I eat out on the veranda? [bear growls] Help, Clyde! Help! Whoa, wait a minute. What's the hurry? Don't stop me, Clyde. There's a bear after me. Buddy, he's running the other way. He is? [hyenas screaming] W-w-w-what was that? Hyenas. We had some at the circus, but they didn't sound like that. 'They weren't hungry then.' [screaming] [animal sounds] There's sure all sorts of wild animals around here. You should feel at home. I'd sure like to take some of them back alive. Say, if we're gonna take ourselves back alive we'd better find a way to get off this island. Look, Larry. A cartridge. See how bright it is? It couldn't have been here very long. That means there's somebody besides us on the island. Come on, let's look 'em up. How are we gonna find 'em in this jungle? You're a great animal trainer and all that, Clyde. But it takes an ex-trapeze artist like me to know his way around this kind of country. What do you mean? See yonder tree? I shall scale it and see what I shall see. See? Oh, boy, I see some huts with a high fence around them. - 'Do you see any people?' - No. But I see smoke rising from one of the huts. [male #8] 'Here comes the cook now.' Oh, good. Did you hear anything in the captain's hut? Yeah, give us a lowdown. Kirby's telling him plenty and the skipper ain't takin' it layin' down either. Kirby, you mean to tell me that you, the first mate of my ship are taking sides with the crew? I don't blame them for squawking, captain. The ship was charted by that explorer for a six months' crew. 'And we've been on this island eight months.' Well, we're not going to sail until Professor Livingston shows up. He was supposed to be back two weeks ago. But if you ask me, I don't think he'll ever show up. One of those jungle cats got him just like they got Connors and Dixon and the rest. I'm not going to leave him on the island and that's final. Either you're gonna leave him on the island or we're going to leave you. Now you've got until tomorrow noon to make up your mind and that's final from myself and the crew. Come on, Nero. Come on. Come on, baby. [laughs] Come on, Nero. Nero! Nero, come back here. Nero, you naughty boy. Come back here at once! Just you wait, Nero. When I get you.. [lion roars] Sammy. [screams] Hey, a panther? No, a woman. There. [lion roars] [roars] Try and hold him off a minute, Clyde. Clyde! Clyde, use this. Clyde. Ruth! - Oh, Clyde! - Oh, Ruth. Oh, Kamor. And you, Larry. Fancy meeting you here. And escorted by a lion. Escorted is right. Especially by Sammy. - Sammy? Who's he? - That lion. He's the most ferocious one in the jungle. - He's certainly a beauty. - Isn't he though? Such poise. Such charm. Such personality. If it hadn't been for you, Clyde.. Believe me, I'll never again object to your training animals. - You mean you did object? - Not at all. She just means she doesn't like it. But, but why, Ruth? Oh, Clyde, you were so wrapped up in your animals you hardly had a thought for anything else. Even the day we sailed away when I came to see you. But, darling, I didn't realize then. You know I'll, I.. Uh, oh, uh, you'll pardon me if I, if I find a place to sit down. Uh, my knees are shivering. I guess I must've caught cold in them or something. I'm so glad to find you safe and sound. Were you really worried about me, Clyde? I sure was. The minute a relief expedition was announced I decided to come along. You gave up your act just to come to me? [Clyde] 'Well, not exactly.' 'You see, the circus season had just closed.' 'There was nothing much to do.' Clyde. Oh, of course, I could've started training some new cats. Then you did give up something to come to Kamor? Yes, I had planned on going to Africa for lions 'and to India for tigers.' But you heard you could find both lions and tigers in Kamor so you decided to kill two birds with one stone. [Clyde] 'That's right.' But how did you know, Ruth? Ruth? Ruth, what's wrong? Lions, tigers, tigers, lions that's all you ever think of. I wish you'd never come here to save me. I wish I were dead. What's the matter with her? What a lover. Don Juan. Romeo. This is marvelous. What is it? [Robinson] 'Iguana.' - Ig, what? - Iguana. It's a native lizard. - 'Have some more, Larry.' - No, thanks. I'm afraid you'll fatten me up for Sammy. Don't lions like fat people better than thin ones? You better ask Sammy. I'm afraid if I ever met Sammy face-to-face, I'd, I'd stutter. Don't tell me you're scared of him? Not much. Every time I think of that cat I get an impediment in my speech. And in my legs too. [all laughing] Let me help you, Ruth. Thank you, but I can get along without your help. What's the matter with you two? She's just glad to see him, that's all. Don't tell me you've had a quarrel already? Oh, Clyde will patch that up alright. He knows how to handle women. Tell me, captain, you're so worried about Professor Livingston, why don't you search for him? - I don't dare leave the crew. - Why? The Mary R. is repaired and ready to sail. The men are determined to leave tomorrow. They're on the verge of a mutiny. That's bad. Of course, I can't really blame them. Lions and tigers have killed over half. And lately, Sammy's been trying to enter the stockade. - Why don't you kill him? - We can't get a shot at him. And we haven't enough ammunition to hunt him down. - Then why don't you catch him? - Not a chance of that. He's too smart. - Have you dug any pits? - No. That's what you need. I'll show the men how. We'll catch some of the animals alive. If you can do that, maybe I can hold the men long enough to find Livingston. [Sharkey] 'That stockade can't be so very far from here.' 'And the ship too.' 'Well, if I'm ever going to get off this island' 'I'd better get down and make friends' 'with Captain Robinson and his crew.' I understand you men have given me until noon today to give you my answer. Right. [indistinct chatter] Well, let's have it. Here it is. I'm the master of the Mary R. She'll sail from this island when I give the word and not before. [crew clamoring] You're definitely sure to be eaten alive. - We're sailing-- - Stop! I'll shoot the first man that tries to board ship. You men have been panic-stricken. Terrified by these jungle beasts. But now that Mr. Beatty has built traps for us there's no further cause for fear. He ain't caught anything yet. [roaring] - Sammy! - He's trying to get in again. No, its a tiger. I think he's in the pit. - We've caught him. - Don't shoot him, captain. - I wanna take him back alive. - Alive? How? If you can let us have some ropes to make a net. We've a ship's net for loading cargo. Would that do? Yes, that's just the thing. [roars] And after you get him in the net what are you going to do with him? Build a cage and put him in it. Look, dad, they're going to shoot the tiger. [roars] Don't forget, Kirby. His skin belongs to me. [gunshot] Say, what's the big idea? Sorry, I had to do this. - But I want that tiger alive. - You want? Alright, Kirby. Mr. Beatty plans to take some wild animals back to his circus. Okay, if you say so. Come on. Hey, fella, lend me a hand with the net, will ya? And I'll slip you a couple of passes to the circus. I've seen all the wild animals I wanna see on this island. And I don't care for freaks. [men laughing] [Clyde] Get a hold of the corners. [tiger roaring] Don't drop it now until I give the word. And be sure you keep clear or he'll drag you in. Now. How do you like that? Ha. 'You're gonna make a lot of new friends' when you get back to the circus. Oh, it's no use. That's no way to act. Nobody will like ya. 'My foot's caught in the rope! Help!' [tiger roars] I'll have you free in a minute. Make it before he bites. I'm slipping. [roars] That was a close call. Let that be a lesson for you. [roaring] Beatty slipped that tiger under the cage like it was a gypsy. He sure knows how to handle animals. I'll say he does. One or fifty, it's all the same to Beatty. With him here, we'd be pretty safe from the cats. What do you men say to going out to find Livingston? [growls] [both laughing] Well, well, the lovebirds. I always said Clyde had strange powers. Uh, what did he do? Use the hypnotic eye? No, he lassoed him. Oh, I don't mean the midget here. I mean you. Uh, have you forgiven him? I have not. Here comes dad. It looks like he's had a satisfactory talk with the crew. It's all settled. The men aren't enthusiastic about staying here but they'll do it. I'll bet they really wanna see Clyde work on some more animals. - When do we start? - 'Right away.' [Robinson] 'Livingston expected to find the buried city' 'of Kamor somewhere in the mountains.' Then that's where we should search first. I know the way, the professor showed me a map 'he had drawn in his diary.' [tiger growling] The tiger's loose. [roaring] Get into the hut quick, all of you. You'll be killed. [tiger growling] Get your rifle, Kirby. You heard him ask me not to shoot the tiger, didn't you? Hey, you men! Come on. Clyde's got the tiger in the pit. [growls] [Larry] 'Quick, Clyde, grab this.' Okay, Larry. [roars] Thanks, Larry. [growling] [roars] [Sharkey screams] [growls] [roaring] Come on, come on. [roars] There you are. Clyde, it's Sharkey. Get some water. It's no use. Why, it's Livingston's diary. There's a map of the island. And there's a mark. "The cave. "Buried city. Treasure." [Clyde] 'And Sharkey's been there.' 'He's seen Livingston. We've gotta go to him.' [Kirby] 'Right! We'll find the treasure.' Have the men step lively, Mr. Kirby. 'We wanna catch the tide.' Aye aye, sir. Hop on it, men. [growling] So long, Sammy. See you in the circus. It's been a lucky trip for you, young man. You got everything you wanted, didn't you? Yes, sir. I wanted Sammy the minute I laid eyes on him. 'And there he goes.' Isn't there anything in this world you want besides lions? Well, I.. Yes, there is. Well, you see, I, uh, I, uh.. Young man, when I got married I said let's get married and that's all there was to it. Dad. And that's just a hint, captain. [thud] [growling] They've dropped the cage. Clyde! Sammy's tearing himself to pieces. Come on, Clyde. [instrumental music]
