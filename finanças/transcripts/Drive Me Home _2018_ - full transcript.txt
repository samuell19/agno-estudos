Hi Tino! Antò, I'm going to rest. I'm done. - Go rest! See you. - Bye. Antò, listen to this... I wanna live in the big city not sit here and drink spirits... Believe me, this place is dead... it makes you crazy... I wanna get away from this barren land... if you're looking for a chick in this dump... the only dick that can touch her is the parish priest's... I wanna party like you see online, with those crazy gals... Who do I invite here? A few chickens and a cow... but I could stay here, open a whorehouse in this old farmhouse... But where's the whores? Where's the cash? I can make more dough with sheep for these peasants, now that's trash. Hey, you know what we can do with this shithole? You're such an asshole, man We can set up a massive loudspeaker right here. So people'll be able to hear our crap as far as Palermo. You know what? I'll ask your father at the town hall... My father? Wanna know what we should really do? We'll build a wall all around it we dig a great big hole and fill it with water and crocodiles... - Crocodiles? - All the shit you see in castles in films. We'll become an independent village just me and you will live in this place. Me and you! Fuck everyone else! Assholes! Fuck you bastards! Fuck you bastards! - Fuck you! - FUUUUUUCK YOUUUUU! FUUUUUUCK YOUUUUU! Nijmegen, The Netherlands Tino! I haven't eaten in the last 24 hours, thank you. There you go. Take a shower. Come here Antò. "Your AD will expire in a few hours.

Mate, this shirt sucks! Everybody looks down on me. I have to be in Düsseldorf by 10. I have to be in Düsseldorf by 10 too. The bill, please. Two euros, please. Thank you. This truck's a space ship! Or a house... Nice... You're not on Facebook, are you? It took me a lifetime to find you on that other one. It uses a strange language, I can't understand anything. Why don't you add me to your friends? Antò, don't say a word. Hello Anne! How's it going August, no delays? Everything running like clockwork. Listen... I've got a message from the boss. There you go... There's a load waiting for you in Antwerp this evening. It's my day off tomorrow, Anne. I'm sorry, but you know him. You're the only one who can make it. He has provided a little extra for you. Okay, you got it. I knew we could count on you! I'll send you details at the warehouse tomorrow at 7 am. Okay? Ok. Thank you Anne. Thank you. Have a nice trip. Bye. Shit, Anna! What fucking language is that? "August"? Is that what people call you? You're a real kraut now, aren't you? Where did you leave your sandals and white socks? Those are for special occasions. "August". What a dickweed! At least we'll get rid of this dead weight, Turi. No more real estate tax or debt recovery agencies... Look at the bright side, perhaps we'll get a good offer and I'll be able to pay you the work you've done these last years Me too, Turi. Thanks, I have to go now. We'll speak soon. A big hug from me too. Bye... Look at that. Hello. Your ID, please. What? Your ID, please. Good morning. What's the matter? Do you know this guy? Yes. He did something forbidden. It's prohibited to urinate in public. I don't know what they want... Apology. They want your ID. Give it to them. It's on the truck. Go and get it! Antò, you'll get me into real trouble. Bloody hell, I was only taking a leak. There's pisser! What are you supposed to do if you're suddenly bursting, man? Get up there, go on, we're late! Antwerp, Belgium Ready to order, gentlemen? I'll have a cheeseburger... with fries... and a Wiener Schnitzel for him. Wonderful! May I suggest our camembert croquettes as a starter? Do you want some cheese croquettes? Do you speak French? Just a little. I prefer English, sir. Are you crazy? Three portions? Let me do it. Thanks a lot! Who's gonna eat three portions? Let's see how it's going to end up! Go on, then. Tell me about yourself. I'm so happy to see you. Can you tell me why you came? What? Are you so sorry I came, Tino? That's bloody awful, my friend! You ordered three portions of the goddam things! Let me deal with this... Fuck you doin'? Nothing, I'm doing nothing. Am I doing something? You're disgusting... Problem solved. Look, I come here often... this is fucking embarrassing Don't you worry. They'll treat you like a a prince ‘cause of this. Trust me, it's my line of work. Now look and learn. Don't call him like a dog! No! I'm calling him like... Would you have him fired? No no, we'll have good time! Up to you. You son of a bitch Suck it to me! Fuck... the look on his face when you said you wanted the champagne! If there's one thing I learned in London it's that if you don't want to pay, you can always find a way So, when were you in London? Five fuckin' years! It was shit There was once a king, Befè. Biscuit and Minè. Who had a daughter, Befiglia Biscuit and Miniglia. Then there were a couple of sisters... But now I can't remember well... Fuck, I really missed all your crap. I looked so hard for you all these years. It's been so long... I was such a jerk Do you like saunas? What's with saunas? Do you like it? Yes, I like it. What the fuck are you doing? Tino, what the... Fuck! Fuck you laughing at? I'm not sure if we're really living through this or am I just remembering something from years ago? Welcome. Two, please. Fuck, it's late! What a pain in the ass! Die! Everything's cool Come on, hurry up. Move it, I'm bloody late! You stay in the truck I don't want anyone to see you! You can't be serious, you should have left already hours ago! Jesus Christ, you'll never make up for the time lost, you know that? Ok, here's the paper work. Load up the goods as fast as you can... Where shall I drop you off? Have you decided? I don't know. My head's exploding... Vladimir, can you hear me? Back. Vladimir, Volcano here, can you hear me? Back. Volcano, Vladimir here. Modulate. Back. I Left with a delay from Antwerp. Direction: Italy, Venice area. Careful in Frankfurt - Munich. There's been a car accident near Munich. Haven't been on the scene yet. Cheers,Vlad. Speak to you later maybe. Back Over. No problem. See you. I'll be driving all night long... Fuck! Anyone there? Back. Someone's listening? Back. K31 here. Can you hear me? Hi K31, I'm stuck! Close to Ulm. Into the traffic here. What's happening over there? A truck made an accident just after Ulm. I'm in the queue for at least two hours... Thanks K31, back over. No problem. What's going on? We're in a jam, can't you see? Of course I see it. Fuck! I'll get out at the next exit. We'll go on the country road for a bit. Tino! Antonio! Children! Remember the time we hid away for two whole days, Tino? We almost set the house on fire. If it wasn't for grandpa, we'd both be dead. But it worked... everyone thought we'd really left home. I still remember your mum... I remember Paola's face when she found us. They're selling it off. Who? The State. I've got debts for thirty thousand euro... The expenses... taxes after taxes... Turi working with no wages... If I don't pay within eight days... it'll be auctioned I couldn't keep up with all the expenses... I did everything wrong... I even came to you without a spare t-shirt. I'll start from scratch and fuck it. A friend of mine is going to Australia... I might go too. I could open my own place... on the beach... the sun... If they sell it, good, I'll get some money to invest... Wanna come with me? Why not... A place only for us, like we used to say when we were young. Yeah. It's my dream... With all the money you've got we can set up some luxury joint. Our waiters will be wearing tailcoats. - ...we can open a brothel too-- - Fuck! You reached nine hours driving. Are you happy, Tino? What? Are you happy... ...with your life...? What's the question? I'm fine with my life! Come on, you must have a motherfucking problem in your life! Are you actually happy to live in here alone? What do you want, man? Maybe once, during these 15 years you've thought about how our lives would be if we'd stayed in Blufi? What did you come here for, Antonio? You disappeared from one day to the next. Without saying anything, without giving me the opportunity to talk. You didn't give a shit about me. You don't know shit! You don't know shit! I found out from your father you were in some school in Switzerland and after that nothing else! If I hadn't come to you, I could be dead forall you care! Antò, fuck you! No, fuck you. Tino! what the fuck did you do? Come along... Can you stand? OK. Can you stand? OK. Let's get down Tino? Tino? What a blow! Can you hear me, Tino? Open up your eyes. Let's get out of here. Open up your eyes! What the fuck did you do? My truck... We’ll fix it, don't worry. Lessini Mountains, Trentino, Italy Well? I can do it: about a half day's work. Okay. So, we can set off tonight? I'm busy right now. I can fix your truck tomorrow. What do you mean tomorrow? We got a delivery to make... I've got work to do, too. Plus, your friend can't drive such a state. He needs some rest. Well I can give you these. It's not much but please... It's very important. My friend's job is at stake. Forget that. If it was money I was after, I'd still be a mechanic. You can give me a hand, if you like. The time I'll save I can use to work on your truck. Where do I start? I'll stay here. Want some? It's a real beast this one. Is it good? Sure. Made it myself. You good girl... You've just arrived... Yes. I ended up here by chance too. Have some more. So we can milk them better. Losing something important is the most atrocious experience that a human being has to face but it can become a precious stimulus for growth. You never thought about getting back home... To go away... to get back... no difference... To go where? That's the point! This is philosophy! Go! Like that! This side! There's a lot! Agostino! Good morning! Karl's gone to the dairy. He said to tell you the truck's ready. Thanks! Listen. Have you seen the guy I was with by any chance? Antonio? No, not this morning... Ok, have a nice day. See you. Have a safe trip. Tino! Tino! Wait for me! Wait for me! Hey, Anne? Hey, August! Just calling to check how you're doing. I'm fine now, Anne I'll be there by 12. Cool! Perfect. Talk later. Anne? Yes? I owe you one. It's ok. Have a good trip. Venice Port Marghera, Italy I'll never forget the day I told my father... "Mayor Torre's son is a queer..." Shame on him... He knocked the living daylights out of me too! He wanted to send me to my uncle's in Switzerland. That's right... so no one could say anything... But I ran away. That's the truth Why didn't you tell me? I thought I'd disgust you. I didn't understand anything... I'm sorry. It was hard at the beginning... I didn't know anyone, I was alone... I used to work at night I didn't understand the language, they'd take the piss 'cause I'm Italian... Then I met Robin. It lasted seven years... He helped me a lot... He taught me Flemish... I became a blond... Then it ended. He fell for someone else... I suffered so much... But I could suffer without being ashamed. And I miss my land. But I'd never go back there. Not even if we built our castle? I thought you were mad at me... You're all the family I've got left... Suck it! - Here's to you, mate! - Here's to you! You could come to Antwerp with me... I was thinking I could spend some time at the farm... Are you in love then? What are you talking about? You're in love! I can spend a few months there and then perhaps with the money from the farmhouse I can buy a plot of land in Australia You can tell me, you're in love! Here's to Emily! Here's to Emily! What about you? I'm gonna drink. What are you gonna do? I'll work. I'll load and upload. I'll drive... Seriously... What are you gonna do... I have some money. I want to buy my own truck. So I can decide when to work. You're right. Turi?! What's up? Yeah, that's good news. It's just that I'm having dinner with a friend... Tell him Saturday's fine. I'll get myself organised and come down. Turi thank you. Me too. Bye. Turi found a buyer... Aren't you glad? What's that face? The buyer is your father. What do you wanna do then? I haven't got much chioice... If I don't sell it to him, he'll buy it at the auction. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Are you alone? Let's go, he's a faggot. "ANNE: Naples or Bari. Both tomorrow" Antò. I've made up my mind. I'll take you to Sicily. Are you crazy? What are you talking about? I can't leave you alone. You couldn't even get to Rome! Since you came all the way here... I have to load in Naples in six hours. So it was all just an excuse for you to have company, right? Might have been... Are you sure you wanna sell it to that asshole? You could turn it into a Wwoof farm... Think about it. Thanks, Tino. Thank you. Promise me another fifteen years won't go by... Cheers Antò. Blufi, Sicily, Italy I decided you shouldn't give away anything to that asshole! 'cause that's your house... If you decide to sell it or not to spend the money for drugs and prostitutes then you can give me the money back, okay? You know where I am. Goodbye bastard, I love you. Thank you, my friend. Fuck you bastards! - Fuck you! - FUUUUUCK YOUUUUU! FUUUUUCK YOUUUUU!
