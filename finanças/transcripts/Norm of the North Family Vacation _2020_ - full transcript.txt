King Norm, Ruler of the North, Titan of the Tundra, Potentate of the Pole, the Sultan of Snow! That's all I got. Uh-huh. Wake up, you royal heinie! I need food! Have you thought about fishing? Fishing? Hello! I'm a caribou! I forage. Lichens, sedges, shrubs. The good stuff. The green stuff. Do you even care? Of course I caribou. I mean I care about you. You look skinny, Mickey. You been working out? Skin... What... Whoa, what got into him? Not food. Try paying a little more attention, Norm. The crown never rests. Uh... It could be my family! Your family will have to wait until you're done - with your kingly duties. - Oh, when is that? After you've heard the last complaint from your subjects. The snow is too soft! - Uh-huh. - The salmon are not running! Uh-huh. And can I call you Mr. Poopy Pants from now on? Uh-huh, definitely. What? Earthquake! Uh... hi? King Norm, I come before you to ask your approval so I can partake in the Jubilee festivities this year. - And you are... - I'm Tiny. No, you're not. You're huge! That's my name. It's ironic. Really? I'm part of the North too, and I want to be part of the Jubilee. Of course. Uh, it makes sense, but... But, well, how can I put this politely? It's just that you're a... I'm a? Well, you're a killer... whale. Everyone's kinda scared of you. Me? Who's scared of me? Hmm. It's my family! Ah. Where are you going? Um, family. What? Wait! Your crown! Uh-oh. Oh, I hate Mondays. Game on, kids. Chase? Maria? Quinn? Yoo-hoo. Ha! Gotcha! Whoa! Huh? Ah-ha! I've got you now! No fair! Oh! Oh! Oh! I wonder who that might be. Whoa! Hey, hey! Whoa! Catch me if you can! Hmm. Whoa! Come to papa bear! That's cheating! You don't win until you catch every last one of us! Gotcha! I win. He fell for it! Hmm? Get him, kids! Oh! Oh, it's on now! I mean business. Do you? Uh, it's not what it looks like. No. It's worse! You're the King of the North, Norm. The King! When you placed that crown on your head, you took an oath. Your subjects need you! And instead, you cavort and frolic? Let's go! Not again. - Come on, Dad. Please? - Just five more minutes. Sorry, kids. Duty calls. I won't be too long this time. We've heard that before. I got a little more work to do, but I promise, when I get home tonight, we'll play a game of Snow Blast, huh? Come on, what do you say? You can't pass up Snow Blast! Huh? - You promise? - I promise. When have I ever broken a promise? Since you've been King, all the time. Well, not anymore. I decree it. Tonight we will have the greatest game of Snow Blast in history! You're on! Be careful what you wish for, for I am Norm, King of the Snow Blast! Oh, grow up. Hello, folks! This year's Jubilee promises to be the biggest and best ever as the new King of the North, Norm, takes his place in the pantheon of the greats. Once again, you're right on point there, Jim. Definitely in the panth-y... Python... Whatever you just said there, Jim. That's what it is. This all seems a bit much to me. Norm, this is the most important duty you will perform! The King of the North needs to place his crown on the apex of the tower at the precise moment of the Jubilee, guaranteeing peace and abundance for the coming winter. That's just silly superstition. Silly super... This is tradition, the way of the North. It dates back thousands of years to the North's first King, Ragmar the First, Olaf the Pungent, even Herman the Meek, all fulfilled their kingly duty. This is our history. This is your duty, and we've got a lot of preparations to get ready for the Jubilee and not a lot of time. Oh, heavens to polar bear. I know, Socrates. I know. There are things to be done. And, hey, your list doesn't look so... bad. Now, I'll tell ya, Rick, these are the very moments that define a king. Does Norm have what it takes to protect the North? Will he be able to lead his team to victory? Nope, probably not there, Jim. Norm needs to realize that there's no "I" in "team." But there is one in "hippopotamus." Right you are, Rick. For once, right you are. That's for sure. Huh? Snow Blast it. - You promise? - I promise. When have I ever broken a promise? Oh, tonight's gonna be a blast! Tonight's gonna rule! Tonight, I'm gonna crush all of you! I'm sorry, honey. I'm gonna make it up. Of course you will, dear. I remember that. We had so much fun that spring. It was the best vacation ever. We should do it again! I mean, after the festival, obviously. And then I have to tour the West Floe, and oh, yeah, I got... I gotta do something about that herring farm. We're never going on a family vacation again, are we? ♪ I'm a little teapot ♪ ♪ Short and stout ♪ Here is my handle ♪ Here is my... Jubilee... No. Daddy loves you. You love Daddy? Yeah? I'm the King of the Snow Blast! Good morning, everyone! Huh? Uh... Look, about last night, I... There you are! Come on! You're needed! But I haven't even had breakfast. Later. Let's go. What's the emergency? There's no time to waste! Preparations are behind schedule. Where's your crown? Fish on a stick! One second. What? You lost the crown? No, I didn't lose it. I'm just questioning the whole concept of object permanence. It was there, now it's gone. Science. Go figure. This is a disaster, Norm! Everything okay, honey? Uh, yeah. Everything's fine, dear. Perfect. Never better. Livin' the dream. I told you, Norm. The crown isn't just a symbol! I know. It's a responsibility. Apparently, you don't know! Without the crown, the Jubilee festival can't be completed. We're gonna be cursed by an endless winter. What? That story, it's just a superstition. It's decreed! If the King of the North doesn't crown the ice tower during the Jubilee festival, an endless winter will fall upon the North. It's our history, Norm. That's science. Oh, well, in that case... Huh? What is going on? I lost a contact lens. You don't wear contact lenses. Oh. You're right. What a relief! Mystery solved! Well, look at the time. I gotta go do king stuff. Yes. What... What he said. Hmm. Hey, what's this? Those tracks... Don't look at me like that. You can't keep running away from your duties, Norm. Enough! You're wasting time! Hey, Tiny! What's up, my whale? - Can I ask you a question? - I don't know, can you? May I? I may. I mean, it's really important. These ski tracks, you didn't, perhaps, see who made them? Even if I did, why should I tell you, bear? What? No, I'm not just a bear. I'm Norm, King of the North. Norm, where's your crown? Huh? See? I'm having it cleaned. Look, Tiny, you don't remember seeing anything suspicious about last night, do you? Hmm. Do I remember? Yeah. Suspicious? Weird? Bizarre? Oh, I do remember something! Great! What? I remember you not inviting me and my pod to the Jubilee festival! Something about us being "killer whales." I meant that as a compliment. You know, you're a "killer", whale. Right. Killer-comma-whale. Ooh, darn those misplaced modifiers. - Ask me nicely. - Please. - Nicer. - Pretty please? - Nicer. - Pretty please? With sugar and lemmings on top? Yeesh. That's kinda gross. Please tell me, did you see anything? Well, I do remember a strange ship. What kind of ship? It's all so hazy. It might've been a dream. Oh, let me check my Sonar Chat. - Sonar Chat? - It's an app. Whales invented it, and they never fail to brag about it. I was right! There was a ship entirely made out of ice. The strangest ship you'll ever see. Where? It's headed towards China, and it has this symbol on it. I believe it belongs to the city of Harbin. - In China? - China. - China? - Am I saying it wrong? China. I've been to China. It's a long way from here. Well, you better get going then. Nobody must know you're gone. What am I gonna tell Elizabeth and the kids? - Nothing. - I can't lie to my family. Well, it's not lying if you don't say anything. I guess so. But still, Harbin? And I can't tell my family. We're going to Harbin? Where's Harbin? Wow! Dad's taking us on a vacation! He's trying to make it up to us. In Harbin, China! I'd feel really bad if they ever found out. They won't find out, and the bigger question is, how are you going to get there? Really? I've gotta go see a moose about an ice floe. And how about, uh, my sister just had cubs! Oh, she knows I don't have a sister. You sly bear, you. Sly? Me? What? I know what you're up to. - You do? - Yeah, we heard everything! Everything? Uh... - I don't know what to say. - Me, neither. Did you really think you could plan a surprise vacation to Harbin, China without telling us? Vaca... What? You rock, Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Dad! Dad! Dad! - Surprise! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Okay. It's no luxury liner, but it looks like it'll hold Norm... and his family? No use hiding it anymore, Socrates. They found out about the surprise vacation that I planned on purpose. - What? - Ta-da! Oh. Yeah. This is funny because it's not. Yeah, just go with it. What's the worst that can happen? We're doomed. Well, here's a wrinkle in the old Jubilee game plan. If King Norm doesn't place his crown on top of the tower by the official beginning of winter, chaos will ensue. We're talkin' about the end of the North as we know it. You're talking about polar bears eating polar bears? Lemmings eating lemmings? A muskrat eating, like, a muskox? Yes, Rick. We're talking about an endless winter of disaster. Gross! Get your nasty foot away from my face. Well, if Quinn would move his elbow. - Stop kicking! Quinn? - It wasn't me. - Chase? - He's lying! What is going on out here? Family photo op! I borrowed this from Vera for our new family portrait. Come on, kids. Everyone in. Perfect. Everyone say, "Harbin!" Huh? Harbin! Norm? Sorry, it's just, uh... I'll be back. - Honey? - Be right down. Huh? You dirty, dastardly, despicable... - Dear! - What are you doing, Norm? Oh, you know, looking for the perfect sunset. For the picture. I just want the light to be perfect. Aw, you do care! Of course I do, honey. I'm a bear that cares. Bearing is caring, right? Okay. Places, everyone. Hey, Elizabeth, mind if I set the shot? Of course not. What's wrong, dear? Nothing. It's just the composition is all wrong. The background, the lighting. This just won't do. Crew, this is your captain, port to bow. I mean, starboard to aft. I mean, turn this tub around! Lemmings, abort! Abort! Norm, the background is fine. A little to the left. Too far. No, a little to the right. Uh... Everyone say... Jump! Cheese. Dad, where's the water? How are we gonna get to land? I don't know. Guys, guys, it's just an inconvenience. I've got this. Fong? Hey, buddy! How's the vacation going so far? It's very, uh, ice. Uh, don't you mean very "nice"? No, I mean very "ice." Oh, dear! I'm on my way. Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey! Welcome to Harbin! This looks amazing! See? You give your Dad lemons and he makes vacation-ade! Wow! Whoa! That's mega cool! Wait! Hold up. Let's stay together. - I got Maria. - I'm on Chase. You guys vacation hardcore. Norm? Excuse me. Pardon me. Ah! Chase? Chase? Ha! Uh, Maria, what are you doing? The Watusi! What are you doing? Oh, oh! I don't know. These beats are taking me over.

That's beautiful, but let's go. We're supposed to stay together. Come one, come all. Before your very eyes, Harbin's largest collection of rarities! You, my friend. You! Yes, you. I got pandas and snow tigers and monkeys of every kind, all belonging to Harbin's noble history. This is the real deal, kid. The deal that's real. One hundred percent seal. Ooh. What's that? Uh, shell-oculars. Made from genuine 100 percent pure plastic. Oh, man. Let me guess. Pete? - No, I'm Repete. - And I'm Pete. No, we're kidding. - I'm Pete. - And I'm Repete. Oh, man. Every time. Oh, you've gotta love those twins. - I'll take it! - That'll be 20 cubes. I don't have any money on me right now. Seriously? But my dad is King of the North, I mean, he's good for it. King of the North? Yeah. And I'm the Dragon of the East. Huh? I was born at night, but I wasn't born last night. Give me that. There you are! Norm! Watch where you're going. You hurt them. Oh, dear. Are you two all right? They're fine. What am I going to do with you two? Dad! What are you doing out of your workshop? Making sure my Frostbite 3000 is operational. Master Fu, you are amazing! Good to see you, sir. Good to see you all. Sorry I haven't been out more. I've been... busy. It's okay, Mister Fu, sir. You honor us with your presence. Welcome to Harbin. I am Fu, Harbin designer, inventor, architect and father. You're him? I mean, he's you? You're the one who designed this entire city? Every single thing you see. Oh, that's mega cool! I gotta say, I love your work. Can I have your autograph? Kids, come on. He's a designer, but your old man is a king. I thought so. You're Norm, the King of the North! - Guilty as charged. - Told ya. What brings you to Harbin? A long overdue family vacation. Just before the Northern Jubilee? Strange. It's never the wrong time for family fun, huh? Are you staying for the weekend? My birthday is coming up, and I would be honored to have you join me. What? No! Dad, we thought it was just gonna be the three of us - for your birthday this year. - Thanks for the offer, but we won't be staying that long. We all have to get back to the North for the Jubilee. - Phew! - I understand. Well then, it would be my honor to at least invite all of you for dinner tonight. - We can't. - We'd love to. - Oh. - I can't. It'll be our pleasure. We'll be there. Excellent. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to my work. What do you mean, you can't? We're on a family vacation. I know. Uh, look, I have plans. Things to do, people to see. I'll explain later. Look! It's snowing! Ha! What? Hmm. Hmm? Hmm. Thank you, Fu. Dinner was delicious. You're too kind. Wow! Cool! So pretty! Look at all those trophies. - You must be so proud. - Oh, yeah. Skiing was my favorite thing to do with my family. Why did you stop? Well, Harbin takes up all of my time. Cities don't build themselves, you know. Who knows? Maybe if our father was made a king like your father, he'd have the time to take ski vacations - with his family again. - And watch me win? Uh, yeah, right. He never beats me. So, by never, you mean all the time? - I own him. - In your dreams! Boys, please. - Sorry. - Yeah. Sorry. - I'm more sorry! - Nuh-uh! I'm more sorry! You guys are really lucky. - You have no idea. - As if! Oh, you're serious? Come, now. I've had the guest room prepared for you. What was that? Why, that's just the Slide to the Heavens. It goes right through the main hall. Ha! Oh, man. I hate stairs. Easy. Fu stole my crown! Huh? Ha! That's half. That's just bad architecture. Gotcha! Oh, man! Oh, no. - Yello? - Norm? You've reached Norm's summer home. Some are home, some are not. Leave a message at the beep. Two days, Norm! We've only got two days left! If it gets out that you've lost your crown, everyone's gonna freak out! Quiet! Calm down! Yes, the crown has gone missing, but Norm is doing everything in his power to fix it. So... keep calm... ...and Jubilee on. Norm has lost the crown. The Jubilee is approaching and our very existence is now at risk. Yep. Things are definitely curdling in the old butter mill of disaster there, Jim. Huh? Norm? Get out of here. Uh, where's your father? - No idea. - No clue. Guys, I think your dad is in trouble. Dad? In trouble? - Shocker. - He's probably still working. Yeah. "The crown never rests." No, Dad always comes home. If he's not here, it means trouble. Mission improbable. Find Dad. - Booyah! - Quinn, you take the fair. Maria, you take the ski slope. - Chase... - I'm on the rides! Operation Dad Retrieval is a go! First rule of Dad, he is always probably where you least expect him to be. Dad would never ski! Dad would never ride a roller coaster. Where's the last place Dad should be? That's probably where he is. I got nothing. Where could he possibly be? Huh? Hmm. Hey, Pete. Talk to me, bro. - Hello? Who is this? - Shh. Let me out! Lemmings! Thank heaven! It's a trap door. The trigger is one of the trophies, which I'm pretty sure half of them are fake. I mean, come on. No one's that good at anything. Have you seen a big huggable polar bear about yay big and answers to the name of "Dad?" Only some of the time. Mostly, he's just "King." Uh, I don't know. He's not even in the nap caves. He loves naps and caves. Now I'm really concerned. Where's Chase? What? Nervous eating. Wait a minute. Maybe Fu can help. What in the Northern Lights are you doing? Get down from there. Have you gone mad? You can't just destroy Fu's home. We're his guests here! - Elizabeth! Is that you? - Norm? - Dad? - Norm, where are you? Behind the trap door! What are you doing in there? Well, I'm trapped. Of course! Getting trapped in a secret room is the last place you'd expect Dad to be. Was it not obvious to everyone that it was a trap statue? Oh, hang on. Almost. I'm just gonna suck it in. Oh, I missed you all so much! Oh, I thought I'd never see you guys again. I'm so happy. I'm so relieved. - I'm so... - Not telling us what's really going on. Uh, what are you implying? Enough of that, Norm. You've been acting weird since day one. What are you hiding? You won't think the same of me if I tell you. There's nothing you can't tell us. - Right, kids? - Right! Well, the truth is... You did what? - I should've known. Classic Dad. - What are you talking about? This trip was never about spending time with us. It was about you and that stupid crown. No! Well, yes. Well, it wasn't at first, but it is now. You know that you're all that matters to me. - Are we? - Of course you are, but if I don't retrieve the crown before the beginning of winter at the Jubilee tomorrow, an endless winter will fall upon the North and I'll be known as the worst king ever. That's not the only thing you'll be known as. Quinn, stop. No, he's right. I haven't been the best dad recently. Recently? Try ever since you became king! Quinn! No, Quinn. Come on. Come back! I heard yelling and... Dear heavens, my awards! What have you done to my beautiful trophies? Your trophies? What have you done with my crown? And what in the world is that room? Oh, don't give me that. I'm on to you, Fu. All these fake awards mean nothing without the one true trophy, my crown. I don't have any idea what you're talking about. Oh, yeah? Then how do you explain... this? Dear heavens. - I've been robbed. - Oh, don't play dumb. I know you stole my crown, Fu. The skis... the mask, the gloves... the frost-pedo, everything points to you. On my honor, I didn't take your crown. - See? My key is gone! - Huh? The only people that know where I keep it are me and my... The twins! There! Tracks! They're good kids. I don't know why they'd do such a thing. Excuse me. I'm so ashamed. Fu, wait! What in the world happened back there? Fu? Oh, no. Don't cry. - It's okay. - We all have bad days. And your crying is making me sad too. I forgive you. It's all good. I mean, kids can do some crazy things. Take Chase. He once ate an entire wedding cake and he wasn't even invited to the wedding. It's not that. I just feel so much pressure to make my twins proud. That's really why I work so hard on Harbin. That they would be proud of their father. But you're such a big, strong tiger. They even built a statue just for you. That was just the twins trying to cheer me up. They deserve better than me. Being a dad is hard, especially when you have an entire city counting on you. So are my kids. Trust me, your kids love you... even if they don't know the real trouble they're causing. I need your help, Fu. The North is counting on me to return with the crown, like, yesterday. Do you know where they might have it? Follow me. - We got your text. - Thanks for coming. Always, Dad. We're a family. Yeah, we are. Hmm. There's only one place where my twins could be hiding your crown. Nothing is gonna stop us now! Nothing except maybe that icy ascent. I guess it could be worse. It could be snowing. It's worse than worse. I can't do this. You can do this, Dad. You're King of the North. Even more than that, you're my dad. Our dad! The king of our family. I can do this! You're kidding me, right? What? It was such a nice family moment. I mean, you could climb the side of this peak or we could just go inside. Good idea. What is this place? This was our old family home. I built this place a long time ago to protect my family from danger. - It's booby-trapped. - Huh? Only the twins and I know where all the traps are. Okay, then. After you. Just follow my every step and we'll be completely... ...safe! Okay, so the first step's a doozy. I better do this alone. No way, Dad. We want in on the fun. - You guys are with me? - This is a family affair. After you, Dad. Hmm? Heavens to polar bear. We're not gonna be ready in time! Everything is in place for a great Jubilee except for Norm and the crown. I'll tell ya, Rick, it's all about how badly Norm wants it. Does he have what it takes? He'll have to give 110 percent. Maybe even 111, Jim. It's gut check time, Rick. And you know that that Norm there, he's got a real gut. Any ideas? - Over there. - This way! That way! I've got something. This way! Are you sure? One way to find out. Pete, Repete, this is your father, Fu. Pete, Repete, this is your father, Fu. This is your father, Fu. Nice try, Quinn, but they're never gonna fall - for something like... - Dad? Is that you? You were saying? Huh? Oh, no! Snow Blast! Yes! Ha! Yeah, woo! Yeah! Dad, over here! Dad, are you okay? Maybe we should go out and find him? I'll go first. No way! I'll go first. No, I will. As if! I got this. Dad? Who's there? Come out of hiding, whoever you really are. It's me, Norm, King of the North. Aha! Come to papa bear. Oh, yeah. That feels good. Uh, you... - I'm sorry. - I'm more sorry. We're both sorry. We didn't mean to cause so many problems. We just thought if we could give our father a surprise crown for his birthday and let him know how much we love him, he might feel a little more, I don't know... Kingly. It's okay. I'm not mad at you. You just wanted to help your father feel better about himself. But trust me, a crown does not make a king. Family does. That's all that truly matters. I'm so sorry I've been such a workaholic. I love you guys so much. - We love you too, Dad. - We love you too, Dad. Just tell me how I can repay you, Norm, and I will. Aw! Aw, heck, I just love everybody. Come on! Come here. Come here, you guys. Get over here! All right. Everyone in. It's picture time. Whatever it is, it can wait. This is an emergency, Norm! This can't wait! The Jubilee's already begun! And the Jubilee festival has begun. The pomp, the circumstance. And I am pumped for the pomp. Still no sign of Norm or the crown, Rick. And that does not bode well there, Jim. It's bad to the bone. A cold, hard, hungry winter looms. Oh, it's gonna be a real down and dirty humdinger if Norm doesn't get back here with that crown. We have to go back, now! Slow down! Fong, I need you to pick us up and fly us to the North A.S.A.P. No can do, Norm. We're right outside! What do you mean, "No can do"? Bad weather's brewing. The helicopter can't fly in those conditions. Sorry, Norm. Some king I turned out to be. I've cursed winter. Nonsense. We have a foolproof way to get you back home. - Right, twins? - Piece of cake, Dad. If anything can make it through the storm, it's my ice ship. Take it, and good luck. You know, you guys should come and visit sometime. I mean, in daylight when we can actually see you. You guys gonna be okay? We're gonna be more than okay. I feel like a king. What do you say we hit the slopes, boys? Yeah! Things are getting really cold, really fast. Oh, where are you, Norm? It's too powerful! What a strange ship. Whoa! Everyone's expecting an awe-inspiring performance from our orca-stra. Let's give them something to remember! We're not gonna make it! It's too late. I failed. Everybody hold on! Jump! How did you know where we were? Sonar Chat. Full speed ahead! It's go time, Jim! Here it is! Ooh. - Winter... - Has... Arrived! Where is Norm? I thought you said he was gonna be back by now. Yeah, with the crown! I did. He is. I think. We want Norm! We want Norm! We want Norm! We want Norm! We want Norm! We want Norm! - Yeah, uh... - We want Norm! This is going to be awkward. We're cursed, aren't we? We're gonna take that as a yes. The North is doomed! Not so fast! The King of the North is here! With his family! Always my luck. You can still do it, Norm! Crown the tower! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it... Huh? Winter is here! You did it, Norm! You saved the North! No, Socrates. We did it. All of us. Together. I hope you've learned your lesson about never losing the crown again. I learned a more important lesson. Life is all about balance. - Are you okay? - Never better. What did I just say about not letting the crown out of your sight? Let it sit there for a bit where everyone can see it. Right now, it's family time. Come here. Oh! - Get a cave! - Gross.
