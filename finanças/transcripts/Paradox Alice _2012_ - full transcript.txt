Pollution has rendered nearly all of the water in the Earth's ecosystem, toxic. A global war is being waged for control over the planet's dwindling supply of drinkable water. In a last ditch effort to save humanity from extinction, a fleet of ships were hastily built to retrieve pure water from one of Jupiter's moons, Europa. The U.S.S Red Queen and her crew were the first to depart on this dangerous and possibly suicidal mission. Hey, guys. You doin' okay? Morning, Lieutenant. Morning, Captain. So, how are the three stooges today? Moe's a little depressed. They all look a little depressed to me. Too bad you couldn't bring along a lady fish. Huh? Oh, come on, O' Byrne, even you're not that naive. No, no, no, they'd kill each other if I dropped a girl in there. What's our level? Ninety-four. Wow, better than expected. We averaged 1,000 GPMs last night. All right. Give me some head room. We can't blow the cargo on reentry. Yes, sir. We'll top off in two minutes. Lieutenant, you just made my day. Red? Yes, Captain? Fire up the engines. Prepare for evac in three minutes. Tell Doc and Foxe to lock down. We are not scheduled to leave Europa for another six hours. I don't wanna stick around on this chunk of ice any longer than I have to. Yes, Captain. Time to go home. Commander Foxe? I'm a little busy here, Red. The captain has asked that you lock down for liftoff which will occur in two minutes and 31 seconds. Two minutes? Incorrect. You have two minutes and 28 seconds. Fine. Tell captain it's his fault when this garbage can falls apart. Don't fall apart, baby. I better get a bonus for this shit. Doctor Spencer. What is it, Red? The captain has asked that you lock down for liftoff which will occur in one minute and 47 seconds. I can't possibly lock everything down in less than two minutes. I thought we had six hours left. The captain has altered our previously scheduled departure. Must be good to be king. Hey, babe, miss me? Yeah, like I miss my period. Come on, Kat, where's the love? You wouldn't know it if it bit you in the ass. I love it when you talk dirty. Drill secured? Affirmative, Captain. Thirty seconds until liftoff. Thank God for Xanax. Captain, tell Kat to unload the goodies. She's not the only one that hates liftoffs. It's not for the liftoff, Reese monkey. It's so I don't need to listen to you. That's not cool. That's so not cool. What's the status on the IPD? Ion drive's in the green. Just hope this baby holds together when we jump again. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Warning, multiple wall thrusters are not responding. Unable to reach required altitude. She's carrying too much baggage. Recommend shutdown to avoid core meltdown. Negative, Red! Not stayin' here any longer than I have to. Warning, core meltdown commencing. Mission subject to failure. We need to abort! No! On my mark, deploy the chutes. The chutes, those are for-- Three, two, one, now. Damn it, now! Divert all power to the air thrusters. Red, cut engines by 98 percent. Latch onto the moon's orbit. Keep us stabilized. Yes, Captain. That was a hell of a ride. Thank God we're alive. God had nothing to do with that, Lieutenant. What's up with the fuckin' dog and pony show? I almost lost my shit back here. Just a speed bump. You okay, doc? I'm doin' really, really good. Can we ride the roller coaster again? No more roller coasters, Kat. Okay, I'm gonna go night-night now. Okay, Lieutenant, prep the G-tanks. Then all hands in stasis by 0500. Yes, sir. Hey, kid, don't forget to lower the CO2 this time. It took me a day to get my eye sight back. Roger that, Foxe. Captain? Yes, Lieutenant? Sorry I doubted you. Duly noted. Red, prepare for transmission. Recording, Captain. Langley, this is Captain James Gray of the U.S.S. Red Queen. We've departed Europa with a full cargo and are prepping to jump. We're predicting that it'll be double the time on the trip home due to the additional weight. I'll have Red transfer the full report before we're in stasis. We did encounter a few challenges the next crew should be briefed on. End of transmission. Recording complete. Sending transmission to Earth. You're on autopilot now, Red. Keep her steady. And don't wake us till we're two hours from home. Yes, Captain. Plotting a course for Earth now. Uh, yes, missy. I risked my life so that people like yourself could live in peace and harmony. You'd like to thank me? Personally? Why don't we spend a long weekend in Vegas at my mansion. And I know a lot of ways you can thank me. Here's to an amazing crew and an exceptional ship. Here's to our friends and family for all their love and support. Here's to God for watching over us. And lest we not forget the huge fat ass paychecks waiting for us when we get home. You might wanna keep the drinking to a minimum, boys, because booze in the bloodstream while under stasis is not a smart idea. Always the kill joy. Well, if someone would've actually followed the workout regiment that I showed them, then you coulda downed a few, worked it off and been sober in time for the jump, but-- I'm just not into that exercise stuff is all. Unless it involves a bedroom. Touche. Well, don't come cryin' to me when you wake up with rigor mortis. At least I won't need knee surgery from running marathons every other weekend. I think you were separated at birth. Well, at least our crew made it off of the surface this time. Come again? Well, you know, the Mars mission? What? This mission is far from over, Lieutenant. So, how's the desalinization process going? Canisters one, two and three are green. Four has about 30 minutes left. Good. I'll go get the IPD ready for the trip home. Oh, I almost forgot. Red downloaded three VMs from home. Doc, O'Byrne, you should each have one in your inbox. I'm gonna go see what Alice wants before we saddle up. Sorry, Alex. Why? I'm sure your message got lost in transmission. Choose a card. You got it, don't show me what it is. All right, now put it back on top. So what are you gonna do with the money, Foxe? What do you think I'm gonna do with it? I'm spendin' it on the ladies. Please. What, prostitutes? What? You lack vision, kid. We are gonna be rock stars. Now, is that it? How'd you do that? You got a lot to learn about women, kid. See, you need cash to draw 'em out. Oh, God. Fancy cars, five star hotels. They're all about sniffin' out the guys that are loaded which is what we will be. And our balls will feel huge. Big hero balls, and everybody will want to touch our balls. And any woman will put out for the right price. Okay, excuse me. Except Kat here. We're not talking about Kat. That is a nice diamond ring on your finger, though. I would seriously stop listening to anything he says, Frankie. The guy's got an ego the size of a pork sausage. Thank you. Yeah, but he always gets the girls. Not this way, he doesn't. What about you, kid? You got plans for all that dough? My mom and some people at church are in the Red Zones. They need all the help they can get. That is so sweet, Frankie. That's great. Yeah. I'm lookin' into a couple charities when I get home. Well, Foxe, the world is on the brinks of self-destruction, so I hope you are true to your word and you try to go up there and do something good. Wow, excuse me, mom, but nobody's forced us to do this mission. We all signed up knowing it was gonna be a suicide. Don't tell me I haven't gone out of my way to keep Armageddon from happening. We're all fucking heroes. The guy can be cracked. Father Walsh spoke about you again today. He and the congregation wanna tell you how much they appreciate your unconditional passion to do God's work. I wanted to read you a passage from Matthew 8:23 to 8:27. "And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him." I am so missing you right now. I know that's selfish, and what you're doing is going to save us all. But I love you so much. I wanna spend the rest of my days with you, Katherine. You're the most amazing woman that I've ever met, and I'm counting down the days until you're home, and we walk down the aisle together. So, do me a favor. Be safe, and bring your ass home, okay? "And unto the woman, he said, 'I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow, thou shall bring forth children. And that desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rollover thee.'" For today's workout session, we'll focus on strength training and cardio. We'll start with three sets of push-ups which will help strengthen the chest, triceps and shoulder areas. Once we finished today's strength training, we'll move onto the cardio portion of the workout. Hey, honey, I just put Trevor to bed. He made something for you. Isn't that a beautiful picture? He wants to be just like his dad. I love it. He's been having some nightmares lately about you not coming home. And it's starting to worry me. I told him that magic ring that he gave you, as long as you had that, I told him you'd be fine. I don't know if you remember my cousin Brian, but he was killed yesterday fighting in Singapore. I don't know how much longer we're gonna last. I love you so much. Please. Please come home. I love you, Frankie. Just remember that as long as you're a good person, God will always protect and watch over you. Sweet dreams. Twelve hours without food? Yes, ma'am. I don't get you, kid. What's the story with the fish sticks? They're my personal items, remember? They were cleared. Weird is good. But the fact that they go into stasis with you, that's fuckin' weird. Over a hundred G's outside the tanks, and they'd liquefy just like us. What about the hat? What about it? You wore it for the last jump. Well first off, it's my lucky hat. Second, it's an inanimate fuckin' object. Would you hold still? How come the captain doesn't like to talk about the Mars mission? I stopped asking. You should too. Ok, O'Byrne, your heart rate is way too high, okay? You need to try to calm down. Okay, sorry. I still get nervous going under. I got all the luck I need. Thanks, Foxe. Bibles are better. You are good to go, fish boy. Night, kid. See you in a couple months. Red? Red, what's happening? The crew was revived two hours from the destination. What the hell's going on? I don't know. Check stats. I can't see anything! What the fuck was that? Oh, Jesus. Red, give me manual control, now! We lost canister two! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's 25 percent of my fucking paycheck! Where's Kat? I'm on it. Kat, Kat! Kat, down here. I can't see you. I can't see anything. Stay right there, Kat. I'm coming to you. Kat! Damage report. Fuselage took some knocks, but I'm not reading any leaks. How many canisters did we lose? Just the one. Canisters one, three and four, they're still intact. Red, did you wake us because of the asteroid belt? Negative, Captain. You asked me to wake you when we were two hours from Earth. Guys-- You mean, you bypassed emergency protocol over my request? Emergency protocol was not bypassed. What do you mean? Guys! We have a bigger problem. What was that? Must've been a power surge. Power surge my ass! Red, I'm enacting article 27, alpha, tango, Charlie. You are to shutdown and release control to me now. I can not allow that. State your reason. Under article 17, the acting captain is under too much duress to make sound judgment. And therefore, must be relieved of duty. You can't relieve me on a technicality. You endangered the lives of the crew and jeopardized the mission. Bullshit. Warning, multiple wall thrusters are not responding. Unable to reach required altitude. She's carrying too much baggage. Recommend shutdown to avoid core meltdown. Negative, Red! Not stayin' here any longer than I have to. Only the medical officer can enact article 17. Dr. Katherine Spencer is deceased. The decision now falls under my supervision. Captain James Gray, you are relieved of duty. Commander Alexander Foxe is acting captain of the U.S.S. Red Queen. You can't relieve me. I was captain of this ship before you were fucking installed. Let it go, Jim. Fuck off, Alex. Red, restore power, now. That's an order. Red. Red, please restore power. Red, how long were we in stasis? Sixty-two days, five hours and 23 minutes, Captain. So, where are we? You're not gonna like the answer. Wait, is that the moon? What's left of it. Red, where's Earth? Earth was destroyed. How was it destroyed? There is inadequate data to ascertain a plausible conclusion. Screw this. Red's been compromised. Shut her down! Captain Foxe, Mr. Gray is showing signs of paranoia and instability. Recommending sedation. I'm gonna sedate your sorry ass, bitch. Jim. No! Pull those wires, and risk cutting off life support. Alex, out of my way. Jim, we get through all kinds of shit together, all right? Just take a step back. Let me handle this. Red, activate ELT and beacon. Check for transmissions. Found a TDR S.S. satellite. Where? It's 70,000 meters off the stern. It's dead in the water, but downloading its last uplink. Nice job, kid. Admiral Beck. Please, anyone. Any ships or stations out there. You must evac and leave the Earth's orbit immediately. The nuclear--piles have been activated. I repeat, the nuclear stock piles--activated. There's no hope. I don't know how much more of this I can take. There were two more ships scheduled for Europa. Maybe they got-- They were delayed by five months. IPD malfunctions. We're all that's left? Red, check for an IP trail. Besides this ship, there are no other ion plasma signatures in this system. Give it up, Alex. They're all dead. Kat. Trevor. Alice. I know that. I don't think you do! You've got nothin' to lose. Nobody to think about but yourself. They couldn't wait. They fuckin' couldn't wait for us to get back. They took my family from me! Red, are we alone? You are the only life form currently in the cockpit. Red, are we alone? You are the only life form currently in the cockpit. For fuck's sake, Red! Say something else! Just say anything else! What would you like me to say, Captain? Come in. Keep it. Are you sure? How you holdin' up, kid? -I'm all right. -That's the bullshit answer. You got to let off some steam. You can't keep that shit locked up. I miss them. Mom, Kat, and Father Walsh. But... I know they're in a better place now. I'll drink to that. So, are you gonna lock him up? Gray? Yeah. Why would I do that? He threatened to shut Red down. He could have killed us all. You never been in combat before, have you? Look... the man left from Mars with a crew of five, and he comes back alone. Why doesn't anybody talk about it? The man saved my life, more times than I can count. Hell, he came damn near saving the entire planet. Maybe you can cut him some slack. You're right. Come on. Let's go see Kat off. I first met Kat at the dinner party Jim and Alice threw for us. I remember when she walked into the room, she commanded attention. Kat was smart, feisty, could hold her own around a bottle of tequila. Even though I was a pain in the ass, she ran with it. I was jealous when she found Thomas, not 'cause I no longer stood a chance with her, but because they found something together most people can only dream of. Now they have each other again, in peace, in Heaven. I hate this space...crap. I'd give anything for a porterhouse. Jim, you okay? Leave me alone. Talk to me. What's to talk about? I fucked up. You can't go carrying that shit on your shoulders. That shit was my responsibility. Kat was my responsibility. If only I could have gotten us back sooner, I might have been-- I don't know, I might have been able to-- oh, goddamn, my head hurts. You know, next week, Trevor's fourth grade play was going up. Alice in Wonderland. He was the White Rabbit. Best looking costume in that whole cast. Alice made it, she was so good with that kind of stuff. Here. They'd want you to keep living, keep going on. What for? You know, to enjoy the simpler things in life. These fucking ILPs. I just-- I just can't believe that it's only us. I mean, billions of people, and we're the only ones left. We're all alone. Well, you're never alone when you let God in your heart. That's right, my heart was two sizes too small. It's not a joke. Only a handful of those who were killed will be let into His Kingdom because they believed. You should follow the word of God. We need to change the subject. Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord and has made the Lord his hope and confidence. What kind of god would allow this thing to happen? What kind of god would destroy the world he created? He abolished us of our sins and punished the wicked. God has a plan for us. You don't seem to grasp the situation. Kat was the last woman. There is no more Earth, there is no more humanity. We're all that's left, and we're gonna spend the rest of our pointless lives floating around in this metal coffin. God has a plan. There is no God. Are you worried the family didn't make it to Heaven? Let him go! Let him go! Let him go! Stand down, soldier. Alice. Hi, baby. I miss you so much. Don't be afraid, Jimmy. I'm always with you. All you have to do is open your eyes and you'll see me. Is this a dream? No. Please, I just want to hold you. Good morning. Jesus. You look like... like you've been run over by a train sled. I feel like shit. We saved some breakfast for you. Uh, no thanks. I'm having issues keeping anything down. I know it's not the easiest thing to discuss. We need to strategize about how we're gonna survive. And what's the point, Captain? Our species can't exactly go on with just three men. You know, if you want to die, just go ahead, and leave the rest of us with more supplies. Not an option, O'Byrne. Look, we only have enough air and supplies to last us twelve months. And what about the garden? I give it six months. You can only recycle the soil so many times. Listen, we need to start charting a course for... a bio-friendly system. Why? We don't even have enough fuel to get us back to Europa. Solar panels. Utilize the sun in each system we go through, we can get 20 percent power to the engines. Yeah? Then what, Admiral? Go into stasis for maybe a couple of centuries and hope to just bump into another Earth? I don't know about you, but I'd rather spend the rest of my life on a planet than floating around on this piece of-- What's wrong with him? I think he's having a seizure. What the hell? Help me. Jesus, he's gonna rip his face off. Grab his legs. Hold him down! Unbelievable. Alex? Alex? Are you okay? Get a towel. Grab a towel! It's a miracle. God chose you to be an angel of salvation. Alex? Red. Red, please. I need your help. I am sorry, Mr. Gray, but you have been discharged. I cannot assist unless Captain Foxe requests it. That's the problem. I'm not sure Captain Foxe is Captain Foxe. I do not understand. He turned into a woman. I mean, right there in front of us. How is that possible? It's not. It's impossible. Humans are not a species that can spontaneously transform genders. I would have thought the same thing just yesterday. Check the VR footage from the mess hall. Investigating. Investigation complete. And? The information can only be shared with Captain Foxe or Lieutenant-- Stop fucking with me, Red! Compose yourself, Mr. Gray. You know how easy it would be for me to fry your circuit boards? Not as easy as it would be for me to cut off the oxygen to this room. Hey. You have been out for about 48 hours. Gray and I have been taking shifts. It's a miracle, you know. Remind me to lay off the whiskey-- Please tell me that wasn't my voice. Must have a cold or something. Oh, yeah, we cut your nails in case you tried to scratch your face off again. You truly are an angel. Let go of me! Why am I a chick? There's nothing to be afraid of, Alex. What happened to me? What the hell happened to me? Just calm down. Calm down? Are you fucking serious? What are you doing? You need to rest. Let go of me. You've been through so much. I told you to let go of me. But Alex, I just want to make sure-- Jim! Where's Gray? Alex, please, just lie back on the... table. What is it? It's Foxe. -She's awake. -You mean "he." "He" jumped off the examination table. -Started freaking out. -Can you blame him? That's what I'm trying to tell you. Foxe wouldn't listen to me and ran right out of the lab. -You let him out? -I tried to calm him. Jesus, you know, we don't know what the hell's going on here. He could be contagious, or worse, dying. Red? Ask Red where Foxe is. I already tried that. Just ask her! Red? What may I help you with, Lieutenant? Can you give us the location of Captain Foxe? Negative. Captain Foxe is not inside the ship. -What? -Don't worry. He didn't jump out the airlock or anything. She probably can't find him because his DNA signature changed. Well, we've got to locate him. I'll take the stern, you search the bow. Alex? Alex? Alex? Alex! Alex? Alex, are you all right? Jim? You okay? Do I look okay to you? Why did you leave the lab? I don't like it in there. God. Hear my voice? I sound like a fucking prom queen. Take it easy. What's wrong with me? I don't know, buddy, I do not know, but I'll tell you this: we're gonna find out. Come on, let me help you up. I don't like staying in here. It's gonna be okay. Remember that time I saved your ass in Venezuela? Yeah, that was a fun, little assignment. You must have taken out 20 GMVs that day. You could have had more if you didn't slack off and get shot in the leg. I took that bullet for you, you know. That's only the 63rd time you've told me. It's really cold in here. Why me, Jim? I don't get it. Whatever it is, we're gonna find a cure. I can't stay like this. But just-- we're trying to understand. Look at me. What's not to understand? That's not what I meant. Whatever. You don't understand how horrible this feels. I can't stay like this! I can't stay like this! Just relax, take these. Jim. Jim, I think it's gone. What's gone? Damn it, Alex. What happened to you? Where was she? "He" is resting now. Run his blood work. Does it matter? There could be a virus onboard. I'm not keen on losing my manhood, are you? Look, have you considered this might have happened for a reason? I'm listening. We are the last of our kind with no hope of keeping the human race alive, and lo and behold, Foxe spontaneously transforms into a woman? I'm not going there! He's our comrade. We're gonna do everything we can to turn him back. Just...check the blood work again, would you? See if you can find any abnormalities. I don't feel comfortable taking orders from someone who's no longer in command. I'm not asking you to do this for me. Do it for Foxe, he needs us! She needs us. Any news on my condition? No. Nothing. You guys didn't see an alien jump on my face or anything, did you? You've been watching too many movies. What about the milk? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Look, I ran tests on the milk, your blood, the air, the food, everything. It all came back negative. Your DNA, however, slightly changed for...obvious reasons, and according to your telomere count, you... went from being... 36 to 21 years old. Dude, what the fuck? Pay attention. Sorry. Red, why did I become a woman? Unknown voice signature. Please re-input. Red, it's me. Alexander Foxe? Pitch up your VRM a couple of octaves. Red, are we alone? Red, are we alone? Red, are we alone? Voice match confirmed. What can I do for you, Captain Foxe? Emphasis on the "fox" part. Dude, don't be a dork. Sorry. Red, do you have any idea why I suddenly switched genders? I do not. Why I'm 15 years younger? None. What about a habitable planet? Negative. Can I get any good news around here? Well, we can keep the human race alive, so... That's good news. Excuse me? Don't tell me the thought hasn't occurred to you. No, no fucking way, that is so not gonna happen. You need to accept the fact that you're a woman. I don't need to accept anything. Embrace the truth. You're the only person alive who's capable of creating more human beings. Shut up, kid. Kid? Really? That's funny. 'Cause technically... I'm no longer the youngest person on this ship. Red, can I get some positive news before I become a suicide risk? Captain, I am limited only by my scanning radius. As long as the ship continues moving, I may come across a bio-friendly system. Well, that's something. Red, chart a course for 51 Pesac. That's 42 light years away. That's the closest solar system. We'll go into stasis, we'll put Red on autopilot, and hope we get lucky. I agree with you, Captain. But the ship sustained heavy damage. Some specific repairs are required before we can proceed with our new course. Why haven't you two done any repairs yet? Well, we've been a bit busy. Ow. You okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. See you--you look like you're back to your old self. Very funny. Here, let me help you. I don't need your help. Okay, sorry. You used to beg me to help you with that mechanical crap. That's because your lazy ass forgot what it was like to be a grunt. Hey, hey, hey, being captain was hard work. Yeah, of course it was. Giving orders, sipping lattes, and having video sex with Alice over a private transmission. You knew about that? Everyone knew about that. Ow, fuck! Relax, relax. Here. On my count. One. -Two. -Three. We make a pretty good team, huh? Yeah. Well, you probably get the rest of it on your own. Kat? God saved humanity. We've not been forgotten. Oh, really? Then ask your God to find us another Earth. Ask him to magically conjure up an infinite amount of food. You're mocking me. There is no God, Lieutenant. You're wrong! He's not abandoned His flock. He has delivered to us a woman, Foxe, to breed and continue humanity. Making babies won't matter if we can't feed them. Who said we? There's no you in this picture. What makes you think Alex even wants to have kids? Doesn't matter what she wants. It's her body, it's her right to choose. Morning. Alex. How you feeling? Actually, better. Running laps was kind of therapeutic. Good think we didn't toss any of Kat's stuff. Yeah. I don't know how women deal with these things. They're a pain in the ass. Don't you think you might be a little more appropriate if you wore something else? Okay, Dad. So it was okay for Kat to wear this when she worked out but I can't? -Red. -Yes, Captain. I sealed the port airlock this morning. Are we good to fire this baby up now? Affirmative. Well, then, take us out. Any news on my condition? I'm afraid we keep hitting brick walls. You said my DNA mutated. Yeah. Could we trace the inconsistencies in both my male and female DNA and find a road map? I suppose I could run a simulation. And if the simulation shows my DNA transforming, could we reverse it? I... I really don't know. Could you go to the lab and at least try it? Well... I'm not really a medical officer. Please, Frank. I know you're really good with computers. Could you at least try it? For me? Sure. Yeah. Thanks. Where are you doing? Remember how I kept blaming you for that CO2 problem? Yeah. Turns out there's a leak. Oh, do you need any help? No, I need you to run that simulation. Jim. Yeah. Can you hand me the wrench? It's not every day I catch you staring at my ass. Sorry. Not that I blame you. Thanks. When I tell you, switch on the CO2. Do you miss standing up? You mean when I pee? Yeah. Nah. Funny thing is, I've always been really grossed out that you guys missed the bowl all the time. I don't get how you do it. What do you mean? I mean, how you're dealing with this problem. Okay, switch it on. Oh! You can put me down now. Maybe it's an opportunity. I always liked that about you, you know. What? Your positive attitude. Got some nice traits yourself. I do? You've got a big heart. You're always protecting the ones you love. Great. Got a sec? What's up? I may have found something in the simulation, but I need a second opinion. Would you mind going in and taking a look at it for me? Sure, come on. Oh, no, no. I, uh, I don't want to alarm Foxe. I'll stay here with her until you get back. I'll be right back. Promise. Okay. So, what's the news? I'm sorry. But the simulation came back with nothing. In fact, when I ran your old DNA profile, it came back female. Doesn't make any sense. I know. There's no denying that God has intervened. It's time to stop searching for answers. Time to start accepting your role. What? That can't be! God is our shepherd. He has delivered us away from the wicked. To start again. Free of sin. Okay, no one in their right mind would spend four and a half billion years trying to build a planet just to blow it up. The Lord said, "Throw it to the ground." And Moses threw his staff on the ground and it became a snake. And he ran from it. Then the Lord said, "Reach out your hand... and grab it by the tail." Okay, you're really starting to freak me out. Don't be scared. I assure you. God wants our union to be fruitful. Okay, as your captain, I'm ordering you to-- What the hell are you doing? Do not separate us! We are one. Back off, Lieutenant. I am the prophet! She is my angel! We are not whole without the other. What the fuck is wrong with you? Calm down, Alice. Calm down, that creep just stuck his tongue down my throat! When the time comes, you will know your place. Grabbed my ass, you little shit. I'm the captain, not a piece of meat! My hat. Alex! Alex! Can't you just leave me alone? Are you all right? No. Look, I'm only trying to help. If you need time, I understand. I'm a total mess. My emotions are all over the place. I can't get a hold of myself. I'm so cold all the time, I was never this cold before. Why can't I just be a guy again? I'm changing, Jim. I can feel it. What do you mean? Whatever changed me on the outside is changing me on the inside, too. Don't tell me you haven't noticed. You have started to, uh, sway your hips a little when you walk. Seriously? -Oh, that's not good. -Why? Think about it. That's what women do to lure a guy. I'm supposed to be the guy, not the chick. Are you-- Are you saying you, uh, you want to get laid? No, God, no! But I feel... My body is... I'm so scared. I don't like feeling helpless. You're not helpless. You don't understand. I'm frail, weak! He tried to take advantage of me, Jim. I couldn't push him, couldn't get him off me. I used to be able to defend myself, you know this. It's okay, Alice. I'm never gonna let him touch you again. I promise. You called me Alice again. What, no I didn't. You did. You did it back in the G-Tank room, too. I'm sorry, I didn't-- It's okay. You have something. What? Blood. Thank you. You're welcome. I better get going. I'll catch you later. You bet. I don't want you around Alice. Who the fuck is Alice? Alice, my Alice! Touch her again, and I'll kill you! You don't have the slightest clue, do you? God has delivered us from Armageddon, and has given Eve to me. She and I are on this Ark to create a new life in the image of God. She'll choose me. Choose? Between us. Yeah. You're old enough to be her father. How can you help her raise her children when you're still just a child yourself? Well, you'll be too old to support her and her offspring. You have no purpose here anymore, remember? You're just-- I'm not as old as you think. Hey, Jimmy. Want to sit down? You okay? I'll be fine. What you looking at? Protandry. Pro-what? "When a school of reef fish loses its single female, a male beings acting like a female within a few hours and will produce eggs within ten days. A male will completely transform itself into a female in order to continue a reproductive success rate for a specific species. This is called protandry. Various species of the frogs, reptiles, and fish encounter this opportunistic sex change due to environmental or social factors. While the changes can sometimes be reversed, it's more common that once an animal had changed, it will remain the new gender for the remainder of its life cycle. So what do you think? Hello? Were you even listening to me at all? Could you read it again? It's just... I love listening to you read. Really? Yeah. Your voice is... It's so soothing. Please, please, sit down. Alice, I... I have something to tell you. You called me Alice again. I'm sorry. No, it's cute. I kind of like it. This has not been declassified yet, it's supposed to be confidential, but... I don't want to hold anything from you. I don't want you to, either. Do you remember that mission I went on last year, the one to Mars? Yeah, that was over 15 years ago. It feels like yesterday, I guess. I was the lowly lieutenant on board. Henry Locke was our captain. Everyone else got to go outside, collect samples, do work. Jump 15 feet in the air for fun. While I had to sit in that tin can, keeping an eye on everyone, making sure we were trying to communicate. Captain Locke and Bellows. They took the NPC out for a ride while Smith and Conners were doing their experiments outside. All of a sudden, there was this explosion. I looked outside and the NPC was on fire about 100 yards away. Smith and Conners were yelling into their comms. The captain, he-- he never answered. I froze. Didn't know what to do. I looked out again. My two crewmates were making a mad dash for the ship. Something grabbed Smitty and pulled him underground. Connors made it to the window. I looked down and... He'd been bitten in half. His torso, or what was left of him, was stuck up against the window. Whatever it was was attacking the ship, so I just-- I fired up and took off. I broke atmosphere and headed home. Alone. I'm so sorry, Jimmy. But you're not alone anymore. I'm worried about you. Why are you hurting yourself? I don't know. You've got to stop. Can you do that for me? Will it make you happy? Yes. I don't like seeing you hurt. I'll stop. I'll stop. Picked it today. No thanks, I just ate. Girl's gotta watch her figure. It's really good. Tastes different. Bad? No. It's actually better. I've never really liked apples before. Try this. Can I kiss you? What's wrong? This is wrong. You're my friend. Friend, is that all I am to you? You're married, Jim. We shouldn't even be having this conversation. Look, if you're scared, I understand. I am, too. I've just never felt like this before. Jimmy, please! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just so confused. I'm sorry. I am, I'm sorry. I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do. I'm starting to have feelings for you. And... I mean, this can't be right. Right? I think you should leave now. What's that smell? Oh. Sorry about that, I'm just preparing some metal fastenings. Well, don't let me stop you. Gray? Yeah? I'm sorry. For the way I've been acting. Everybody deals with stress differently. The world is gone. And I snapped. You're apologizing? I am. And I promise not to interfere if you want to pursue Foxe. I can tell you two like each other. She's pretty amazing, isn't she? Yeah. Who took this picture? I don't know. I don't ever remember taking it. Must be some fans from a space convention or something. Hey, you! Everyone stand back, beautiful woman coming through! You need to let go, Foxe... A mother and her 12-year-old daughter were killed in a tragic car accident today. It's your fault they're dead. You must be Alex. Set her free. Alex, I love you. I'm Jim. Thank you for the beautiful rose, Jimmy. I'm sorry about the way I treated you the other day. So I thought I would make it up to you. How do I look? Think of it as a gift. Lieutenant O'Byrne, your actions are endangering Captain Foxe. Cease them or I will be forced to-- Forced to what, Red? Throw article 17 at me? She is an angel. My angel. If you try to stop or kill me, she dies. Shit. Do you know why God made me a prophet, Alex? Please stop. You're hurting me. He made me a prophet because prophets can see the future. Did you know that? God loves us, sweetheart. He wants us to survive. And I've seen it all come true. All because you bear my children. No, it's not true. Oh, I've seen it. I've seen them. Three beautiful children. Just like their beautiful mother. And I've seen you sitting next to a cabin by a lake reading to our kids from the Bible. Their mother, their teacher, and my lover. I won't let that happen. The thing that you now wear around your neck can't come off. And if you try, bam! This thing has a range of 100 to 200 volts. Things will get a little messy if you piss me off. Please, please don't do this. Don't do this. Shh, shh, it's okay. It's okay. Confess your love for God. I can't. Well, how about I kill your sweet little Gray? Please, please don't hurt him, please don't hurt him. Confess! I love God, I love God, I love God, I love God. Now... confess your love for me. I love you. What was that? I love you. There. That wasn't so hard now, was it? God surely has molded you into one of the most beautiful creatures I've ever seen. You should be thankful for what he's given you. I am thankful. I'm thankful he chose me to be yours. I'm happy to see you're embracing your more feminine side. The clothes, the makeup, the hair. It makes sense why you've been hanging out in Kat's room. I think that would be the appropriate attire for this evening. What's this evening? My quarters, one hour. I can't wait. Captain Foxe, are you okay? No, Red, I'm not. Lieutenant O'Byrne is unstable and in need of psychiatric attention. No, really? Red, can I get pregnant? Yes, Captain. Your body was biologically altered. You can now produce offspring. What are your orders? I have no orders to give. I have to do what he says. But you are the captain. He must follow your orders. Titles don't matter anymore, Red. O'Byrne's right. I have to take on my new role. Or he'll kill us both. I'm sorry, Jimmy. Alice? Oh, thank God, Jimmy. What's that on your neck? O'Byrne. What? He attacked me and he put this on me. He thinks he's a prophet of God. He said I have to do whatever he wants or he'll kill me. Kill you? The collar. I can't get it off. He's trying to control me or brainwash me. I'm so sorry, baby, I'm so sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. I'm so scared, Jimmy. It's okay, it's okay. We're gonna be all right, everything's gonna be all right. He wants me to have his babies but I don't want to. I'd die before I'd let him touch me again. Listen to me, I'm here now. He won't touch you again. Oh. Alice. I love you. I do. I do. You sure? What's wrong? Alice, I love you. I love you, too, Jimmy. No, no, I mean I really, really want to make love with you, but he's out there. He's out there. I don't understand. Come with me. Stay here and be as quiet as you can. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna get that collar off you. No, please don't leave me. I promise I will never leave you alone. Alice, I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Yes. Yes, baby, of course I will. Where did you get this? I found it in my room. I know it's not much-- It's perfect. Then stay here and wait for me to come get you. Okay. Sweetie? Where are you? Shit. Oh, shit. You were hiding her from me. Do you love her, Jimmy? Do you really, really love her? I'm gonna kill you. I am gonna crush your fucking skull. At the expense of watching your lover die? You can't kill her. She's part of God's plan. Wanna try me? Put it on. And she doesn't die. Stop it! Please don't do it. It's okay. Jimmy, please. Shut the fuck up! Sorry, sorry. See, Jim, that's how you get a woman to obey. I love you. I love you, too. What a mess. You're supposed to love me, you remember? No. Remember, Lord God said unto the woman, "What is this that thou has done?" And then the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me." Please don't do this. "I did eat." Jimmy, please help me. Oh, this truly is a special day for you, for God hath proclaimed this day to be the day that you first conceive of a child. No! -Please! -Don't fight it! I can't! Jimmy! Yes, Alice? Jimmy! Yes, yes, Alice, it's me. Jimmy. It's your Jimmy. Just relax, I'm here right with you. Just relax. Oh! God hath blessed this day and this union. Our descendants will number the stars and your word will live forever. -Give it to me. -Stay back or I'll blow your fuckin' head off. God won't let you kill me, Alex. We are one. We cannot exist without-- Shut up! Children need a father. A woman needs a husband. You killed him, you killed my Jimmy! He was just the snake poisoning our union. -No. -God won't let you kill me. He will not let you kill the last living man and end the human race. I have foreseen it. God speaks through me. You say you're a prophet of God, right? I am the chosen one. Which means that you can see into the future. And it's a beautiful future we have together. So if I were to push this button, there shouldn't be a bang? You don't have the balls to press that button. I don't need 'em. The date is December 25th, 2041. It's been five months since the death of Gray and O'Byrne. I have constant migraines and I'm having a hard time remembering things. I know I am the last of four crew members alive on this ship. I'm also the last human being I know of in existence. I am a paradox. I have no logical explanation as to why I turned into a woman after the Earth was destroyed. Was it the master plan of some supernatural being, or was it a genetic anomaly that jumpstarted when my species was on the verge of extinction? March 31st. It's been over eight months since my husband died. I miss him so much. I know I'm going to have to go into stasis soon. Red keeps telling me we don't have the resources to survive-- that is, unless we find a planet for us to live on. I pray for courage, I pray for strength, I pray for them. This is Captain Alice Grace signing off. "My son, observe the commandment of your father and do not forsake the teaching of your mother. Bind them continually on your heart, tie them around your neck. When you walk about, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk to you. Alex? My name's Alice, Red. I apologize. I thought you disliked that particular book. The Bible? No, it's an amazing book. Besides, they seem to relax when I read it to them. Ooh. Someone's not happy I stopped. I do hate to sound repetitive, but you should prep for stasis before you go into labor. It's called procrastination, Red. Not really keen on falling asleep knowing that I might not wake up. The chances of finding the right land mass for your needs is 10,055 to 1. Thanks. You really know how to cheer a girl up. While you are in stasis, I will continue researching a way to transform you back into a male. I don't want you to. That's illogical, Alice. I love who I am, Red. I love being a woman. All I remember about being a man is that I was selfish and self-centered, and now... all I feel is love. Love? It's not something you can explain, it's... it's something you feel. And I know I'm gonna love being a mom, too. I cannot image what it must be like to bring life into existence. It's amazing. Are you okay, Alice? Oh my God! What happened? Oh my God! I have to push them out. No, you need to quickly get into your G-tank before your water breaks. It hurts so much. Oh my God! I have to push! No, you and your babies will not survive if you give birth now. Something's wrong. I just want them out of me. The pain will stop once we get you inside your G-tank. I love you, Jimmy. Alice, can you hear me? Alice, are you okay? Wake up, please wake up. Confirmed. Human female is paralyzed and ready for colonization. Vitals are stable-- stable and will be born soon after the female is awoken from stasis-- stasis--stasis. Affirmative. Once the female and her offspring have safely vacated this vessel, I'll turn the ship over to you for termination... for termination... for termination... for termination. ♪ Hey hey hey ah ah ah ♪ ♪ My heart swells, my body burns like the sun ♪ ♪ My eyes reborn so I could see all the hurt I'd done ♪ ♪ I had never known how to love someone before I changed ♪ ♪ My lips tasted trust, his heart filled me up until it was ripped away ♪ ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ ♪ My chest aches, my body yearns for his touch ♪ ♪ My soul breaks, my affection for him was the perfect rush ♪ ♪ Like a butterfly, I broke from my shell to be with him ♪ ♪ But now deep inside, this shame-tainted bride is host to another's kin ♪ ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ ♪ I am whole ♪ I am lost ♪ I am pain ♪ I am now ♪ There was a boy and then a girl and they had come from different worlds ♪ ♪ He was the moon, she was the sun ♪ ♪ There was the light, they become one ♪ ♪ There was a boy and then a girl ♪ ♪ And they had come from different worlds ♪ ♪ He was the moon, she was the sun ♪ ♪ There was the light, they become one ♪ ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ ♪ My heart ♪ My heart has a plan ♪ Love will be the death of me ♪ For me ♪ For me ♪ For me ♪ For me
