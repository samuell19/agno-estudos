Yes, it is. - Thanks for coming. - Oh, no, thank you very much for your cooperation. And, again, give me a call if anything comes up. I will, thanks. Why are you lying? - I'm not. - Yes, you are. Ashley wouldn't have come up with something like that. Ugh, well, I didn't come up with it. - Yeah, who did? - You. What are you talking about? On one of your drunken rants you went on and on about this Stalker Club game that you played when you were a kid and how it ruined everything. What else did I say? Nothing. Don't lie to me. That's all I heard, I swear. It wasn't me, Mom. I didn't start it. So who was it? This Darren kid? I don't know, but we all swore that we would stop... that the game was over. I guess it's not. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ - Are you following me? - What? You're following me, aren't you? No, I... I was just going to class. Where were you yesterday after school? I was at the tech expo. Geez, Ash, what's wrong with you? Can you prove it? Yeah. Satisfied? Damn. I thought you were cool. You're a real bitch, you know that? I guess you talked to the police. Yeah, and I told them it was all in your crazy little head. Chloe, don't forget you have detention after school today again. Whatever. You were here after school yesterday? Really, Ashley, you think it was me? Please. You're such a headcase. Nobody would believe you. But if you get any more bright ideas... I'll make sure you're the one that goes down. She's such a bitch, Ashley. I mean, don't you remember all the cruel stuff she used to do to us when we were younger? Putting worms in our lunch bag, locking us in that shed, putting a beehive in our fort? That's right. The bees, that... that was Chloe. Yeah, I know 'cause I got stung. She was a bitch then and she's a bitch now. So it has to be her. What are you talking about? Um, it's a long story, Meredith, so I'll tell you later, but... will you come with me somewhere tonight? If you help me... we can finally bring her down. Hell yeah. ♪ ♪ We have to tell the truth. It was 30 years ago, Karen, it's done. It's not, Anna, and you know it. I mean, my daughter just got chased through the school last night. How do you know that had to do with what we did? You think the masks are just coincidental? Oh, my God, Luke. Look what happened to your daughter. Karen, stop! Those masks could be in any dollar store in any state. You're being an alarmist just like you were back then. - Really? - Really. Well, obviously, if you'd all listened to me and not started the club in the first place, nothing would have happened. - You played the game, too. - Yeah. No, I didn't, and I told Anna I wasn't gonna play... yet she told all of you that I was so I could continue to be stalked which is her idea of having fun, like it was her idea to go too far with the stalking. What happened to Teresa was an accident. Then we should've told the cops. Look, we were teenagers. And I don't know about you, but I was scared to say anything. So was I. Well, someone in this room was there the night Teresa died... so someone in this room knows what really happened. How are we still talking about this 30 years later? And how did our kids find out about it? We were the ones that made it up... and we swore never to tell anyone. Maybe someone did tell. Okay, well, it doesn't matter how they found out. What matters is that we finally do the right thing and tell the police so they take what's happening to our kids seriously. I mean, Linda has lost Mark, Luke lost Sadie, and I already lost my husband. I'm telling you right now, I'm not losing my daughter. All right, everybody, let's sleep on it. We can make a decision tomorrow, okay? Right. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I've had a long day too, Mom. ♪ ♪ Okay, so... you're gonna call Chloe and then tell her that I've gone off the deep end or something, that I've threatened to go to the police and tell them that she's the stalker. And then she's gonna get really pissed off... and she's gonna want to stop me... and I'm gonna videotape her. Sounds good. - Meet back here? - Yeah. - Good luck. - You too. ♪ ♪ Mom? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hello? Stop, Mom, stop yelling at me. Look, this is your fault, okay? If you hadn't told me about this stupid club in the first place, my friends would still be alive, my boyfriend would still be alive!

Of course you lied... because it was you, you killed Mark - and Sadie and Chloe. - What are you talking... Don't, just don't! Ashley, I don't know what you're talking about. Mark wasn't an accident and Sadie didn't kill herself. It was you. You... you killed both of them and you killed Chloe. What? This is crazy. I videotaped it so you could stop lying! Fine. Go ahead and think what you want. I'm not gonna stay here to get accused of something I didn't do. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Mom, Mom, Mom! - What are you doing? - Mom, it's Darren.

You win the game! Why, why are you doing this? Because 30 years ago, your mother and all her friends got together and formed a clique... called the Stalker Club. I found out about it two years ago... after my parents sold the house. I was helping to pack up my sister's things, and I found it. It was just an old school journal... but it was all there. The rules of the game... the pact not to tell anyone... and the torment she was going through. It all made sense then. The late-night phone calls... Hello? the jumpiness... Teresa? What's wrong? the notes that she would crumple up and hide, and the fact that she started sleeping with the light on... and the mask I caught them all wearing... all leading up until the day we found her. - Teresa, come on, wake up. - I'll call an ambulance. The police, they said it was an accident, that she tripped on her shoes and fell down the stairs. Operator, I need an ambulance. But I know the truth. It was them. They killed her. So now I'm taking from them what they took from me! The ones they love the most! Get the hell off my daughter! You take one more step and I am gonna slice her throat. Beth, listen to me, I'm sorry. I told them not to play the game, but they wouldn't listen. You're a liar! It was you, too, you were one of them. Beth... once I realized how horrible the game was, I told Anna I didn't want to play, but she wouldn't listen to me. And when your sister fell down the stairs because Anna took the game too far, I told them we had to tell the police, but they all told me that we would go to jail. Beth, I'm sorry. I was scared, I was 17. You took her away from me. Do you know how that feels? Please, Beth. It's been 30 years. Don't you think it's time to end the game? Please, give me the knife. You know the rules. Once you join the Stalker Club, you can never leave. ♪ ♪ She was my sister. ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey. All right there, tough guy, come on. You're not supposed to be walking on your own yet. I know, I know, but I needed an excuse to get close to you. Oh. Hey, did you, um, did you hear about the club? What about it? It's everywhere. I mean, it's all over social media and the internet. - How? - I don't know, but it's become this, like, international phenomenon. Why would anybody want to join, especially after everything that's happened? Beats me. Well, I never want anything to do with it. Hey, Darren, you keeping an eye - on the barbecue for me? - You bet. So... do you think you can make better burgers than my mom? - Well. - Wait a second. You really think you can make better burgers than I do? - It's kind of my specialty. - Oh, we'll see about that. It's my specialty too, ask Ashley. Okay, I'm sensing a cook-off here. I'm gonna go get the buns. It's on.
