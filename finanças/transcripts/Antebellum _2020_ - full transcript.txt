Em? Darlin'? Get. Kill me. Kill me. Now, don't you worry, girl. I will accommodate you. No! I often ponder the depths of your loyalty. Prove me wrong. Say your name, girl. Say your name. It brings me no joy to do this. Silence! You will speak only when I instruct you to speak. I am responsible for you now, and I will tame your savage ways. - Now, get up. - No, no! Come on. Say your name, girl. Comply! You've given me no choice. Now, please stand up for me. No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! Your friends are dead because of you. You know that, right? Try to escape again, I'll drag you to the burn shed myself. Now, let's try this again. Say your name, girl. Eden. Eden. Say your name with pride and conviction! Eden. My name is Eden. That's good, Eden. Real good. Everything will be all right now, and, uh, you can stop that cryin'. Maybe I can get away for supper tomorrow. You can make us a chicken. Y'all seem easily distracted. Why don't we break up this monotony and get y'all focused? Go on, sing us somethin'. Perhaps one of those old Negro tunes. We need to move. These fuckers is crazy. Next time, I won't be so generous. Back to work. All of you! Let the sound of Confederate victory bring joy to your labor. Milk, chicken. We must try again. - Get down. Get down! - Get off there. Come on. - Get off the wagon. - Move! Get out of here! What you lookin' at? Line up. Come on! Hurry! Line up! Get over there. Eden! Get your ass down here, girl! Separate yourself. Turn. Look at her hair. Quite a beauty. Shall we name her, child? Mmm... Let's name her Julia. Hmm. You hear that? Those are worker hands. You're dismissed. Well, welcome home, one and all. Now, listen up! All of you. This here is a reformer plantation commandeered by the Ninth Infantry of the Confederate Army of the 13 states. Wherever you were before, whatever small freedoms you might have enjoyed, I'm here to tell you that's over. I don't tolerate any back talk whatsoever from inferiors. In fact, on this plantation, you will only speak when given permission to do so. That means absolutely no talking among yourselves unless one of the white folk on property... ...gives you permission to do so. If you do... Oh. We will know about it. Over here, you will find your cabins. You will also be given instructions by one of the overseers as to your daily duties, which ought to be followed obediently and with a smile. Here, we whistle while we work. Ain't that right, Eli? Raise the flag, Corporal. The general will be home this evening. You're dismissed. Get. Go on. Walk, now. Get on. Let's go, move. Hey, what is this? Quiet! Go, now! Mmm. You started early. When? How many... Get in here. You're from Virginia, right? I'm from North Carolina. Look, I can't do this. Whatever you're doin', I can't do it. Listen to me. Wherever you came from before here, - you need to forget about it. - Mmm-mmm. That is not possible for me. What are we doin'? Huh? What is the plan? You think I haven't tried? We must choose our moment wisely. But until then, we keep our heads down and our mouths shut. Do you understand me? I know you. And I know that you are my only way out of here. I'm pregnant. I need you to listen to me. You have to keep quiet. These white people will kill you. Oh, you think being quiet is being strong, huh? What has that ever gotten us? You ain't no leader. You're just a talker. Ain't that right, huh? You... Hey! What, you just a coward nigger slave with a brand and no backbone? Blood and soil. Blood and soil. Blood and soil. As you were. First, I want to congratulate you on our defeat of the Yanks at Milliken's. This is what victory looks like! We got those blue-bellied bastards on their heels, Washington in our sights. But we must never relent. We are descendants of the gods and we will fight with the same immeasurable courage and vigor. We will sacrifice our blood and fertilize this soil of our homeland. This is the only hope we have of retaining our heritage, our way of life. This land was always ours. It is our rightful inheritance. And, rest assured, our nationalist state will not be stolen from us by these traitors to America. I have faith in this because I have faith in you. You all are the future. And it is you who will lead us all to the ultimate victory. But for tonight, let us put away our troubles. Drink and be merry. You've earned it. All of you. And, by the way, these Sapphires are here to fulfill your every need, whatever those needs may be. Faith! Family! Folk! Faith! Family! Folk! As you were. So, which one of these girls do you like? What? Which one of these girls do you like? Hey, angel. Yeah, you. Come here. I don't bite. Come on. My compadre here was just telling me he thinks you're real pretty. No, man. No. What, you don't think she's pretty? Hmm? No, I mean... Yeah, of course I do. Well, then. She ain't gonna say no. Hmm? Talk to her. You're in charge here. Um... Uh... I, um... Well, I... Oh, just... Fuck's sake. He will meet you at your cabin immediately following dinner service. You're dismissed as of this moment. Now, go and prepare for your corporal. What's that, girl? Yes, sir. That's more like it. Go on, now. Go. Well, you enjoy, all right? I'm going around back to the whipping post. If I may? I never got your name. Daniel. Um... It's Daniel. Well, thank you, Daniel. For earlier. You said that I was pretty. Of course you are. Anyone can see that. It's, um... It's just been such a long time since any man has been nice to me. I appreciate the compliment is all. How'd you get to be so sweet? Look, you don't... You don't have to do this. I can tell that you're special. You're not like the others. Those monsters. Why'd you speak to me? You mean, when your friend called me over before? No. Why'd you speak to me when I entered the room just now? Uh... I just thought we should have a proper introduction. You have a short memory, then. You heard Commander Jasper. You speak only when given permission to do so. - Is that not right? - Yes, sir. Uh... I mean, Daniel. No. It's "sir"! You don't know shit! You don't know shit! Okay. I'm as much a Confederate as any man here. Because I don't wanna sleep with no filthy fucking mongrel instead of my own kind, that don't make me no... I'm... I'm a patriot! You understand me? Shut the fuck up! Shut up! You're lucky I don't tell Jasper. You better make him believe I had my way with you if you know what's good for you. You understand me? Get off of me. Uh... Well, you're forgiven your tardiness, this time. Don't make it a habit, or the stocks will be waitin'. Are you okay? Please... I know. Be patient. Just keep goin'. We have to keep goin'. Oh, no! No! No, no, no! No! - Oh, no! No! - It's okay. It's not okay! Cracker! The fuck you just say, boy? Oh, I'm gonna be right back for you. Hyah. What the fuck is the issue? She's sick, sir. Oh, no... Oh... Go on. Go get yourself cleaned up. May I go with her? She can handle herself. Get back to work. Sir... Oh. Fine. Go clean her up, get back here. Take hold of him. It's okay, boy. Now, what was that you were sayin', boy? Oh. You missing your woman? Give me an excuse. Go on. No. Why, that reminds me, the shed needs cleanin'. Too many foolish Negroes with rebellious hearts. Yeah. Go get that cleaned up, boy. That should stop you flappin' them gums. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Go on, get. Cracker-ass cracker. Sweet dreams, Eden. Good morning, Steph. Good morning, V. Just making sure you're ready for your flight. Skype is at 8:45, and the car will be there at 9:00. - Oh, shit. Okay. All right. - Okay. - Thanks, Steph. Bye. - Safe travels. Another bad dream? No. I'm... I'm okay. Babe? Can you please do me a favor? Anything. Can you get Ken Ken dressed for me today? Of course. Mmm-hmm. My first meeting is right here in Georgetown and it got pushed to 11:00 anyway, so... Okay. I don't know. I'm not gonna even be dressed before 9:00. - I got you. I got you. - Thank you, babe. But would it be the worst thing in the world if you didn't make it? Not today. Not today. There she is. My favorite girl. - Guess what? - What? Daddy is gonna get you dressed for school today. I know exactly what I want to wear. You do? - Hurry up. - I'm comin', girl. - She said "Hurry," Daddy. - I'm hurryin'... I'm hurryin'. - Hurry up. - You're gonna pull my arm off. Okay, okay, okay. What you wearin' today? Well, look at you two. Look at you. Mommy loves that dress. Excellent choice, baby. Yeah, she picked it. - Hi, babe. - You stay trendin'. Paused it for you. I understand you think you are defending the plight of the black man. I guess, in your case, the black woman. But we are doing a disservice to the argument, much less your people... by conflating race with basic common sense. I would say this. The disenfranchisement of black people in America is by design, written into the actual DNA of this country. Your argument, however flawed has been successfully promoted and propagated through repetition. We hear it over and over again. But I'm here to tell you that this vicious cycle of inequity will soon be broken. - Boom! - Boom! - Boom! - Boom! Boom! Mommy, why was that man so angry? Oh, baby, that is a really great question. Sometimes what looks like anger is really just fear. Things are not always what they appear to be, baby. Does that make sense? Do you remember when Vanessa was bullying you at school? She was pickin' on you? And Mommy had to come up there because Vanessa thought that you were gonna come in class and take all of her toys away. And now you two are like best friends. So, are you two friends yet? Not yet, baby. Mommy's working on it. Pancake? Pancake? On a Tuesday? What is the special occasion? Well, I was informed it was pancakes or nothing, so, you know, we gotta pick our battles. Um, question, are we vegan this week? Babe, the struggle is real. Got it. So, one non-vegan pancake coming up. Babe, no. I cannot. Elizabeth? Yes. Dr. Henley. Hi. And please call me Veronica. How are you this morning? Oh, I'm fine. That lipstick just looks lovely on you. It suits your skin tone. I don't think I could pull it off. So, do you have any questions for me? How did you come across my work? Oh, I saw you on one of those legacy media networks. I believe it was a roundtable discussion about inclusion. You were so articulate. It must have been a ratings bonanza. Those particular segments do garner a lot of attention. I don't mean to be curt, but do you have any questions around the book? Oh. Your book. Yes, I believe you mentioned it on that show that you were on. As a matter of fact, I know you mentioned it. 'Cause I thought it was rather odd that you chose that moment to be peddlin' your wares. Well, actually, that particular segment focused on the lack of inclusion. And that is exactly what my book highlights. Intersectionality of race, class, and gender. I wrote Shedding the Coping Persona as a road map to revolution for historically marginalized people. Maybe I didn't catch this earlier, but who did you say you were with again? I didn't mention it. I'm a bit of a talent scout. Oh. So, you're a headhunter. That makes sense. I'm a headhunter. Exactly that. Oh. Now, is that Kennedi? Will you move the camera over? Oh. She's so cute. She'll make a perfect little companion for my daughter. I see a playdate in our future. As my assistant mentioned earlier, I am short on time this morning. Oh, no problem. I didn't mean to trigger you none. You have fun at your summit, and I'll see you soon. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Who was that? - Oh, baby. It's nobody. Don't worry about that woman, okay? Okay. That's my car. I can't even imagine what y'all are about to get into. - Obviously. - Mommy, wait. - I'll call you. I love you. - I almost forgot. This is for you. Oh, baby. This is for Mommy? Ken Ken, I'm putting this with all my important work. When you look in the sky and you see that big airplane, you'll know that's Mommy, comin' home to you. - Wow. That's a big head. - Daddy. Come on. It's not that big. And I'm gonna hang it on my wall in my hotel. Yeah. - Daddy. - Yes? Twenty minutes of screen time. Okay. - I need you to be strong. - We got you. Be good. Mommy loves you. Come here. Come here. Kiss me. Give Mommy all the kisses. One minute. I'll be back, baby. I'll be back. - Okay, okay. I love you, baby. - Bye. Love you, babe. - All right. - All right, be safe. I love you. I'll be back, baby. Love you more, Mommy. Okay. Release. And as we begin to gather our thoughts for the day, I want you to focus on bringing positivity and light to each and every situation you may face today. Visualize yourself addressing any obstacles you might face with the same determination and focus that you brought to your practice today. See yourself emerging successful and victorious on the other side. Namaste. Namaste. V! V, girl, I got some tea. You better open this door and let me come and spill it. Positivity and light, right? V! I'm coming! No, no. Faster! I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. - Hey. How are you? - Hey, babes! - Good mornting. - Good mornting. How is the number one relationship specialist... - True. - ...in the world doing this mornting, doll? Well, you know... Ooh, it's hot. Just flourishing. You know, being amazing and fantastic as per usual. - You're looking sharp. Yes. - You know how I do. Thank you. Oh, hello. Why is it so goddamn hot in here? I'm trying to create my own version of Bikram. You know I need all the balance I can get. Well, speaking of balance, I saw you balance and tag that ass last night on TV, girl. You got him all the way together. - Bye. - Bye. Thank you. Okay. Before we get down to it, how is my favorite little human in the world, Miss Kennedi? She's great. She's doing good. Yesterday was tough, though. - It was tough. - I just... Ugh. It breaks my heart every time I have to leave her. Mmm. Ken Ken. I just feel like I'm not doing enough. It's like when I'm at home, I'm not working enough. When I'm working, I'm not home enough. I'm not Mom enough. I'm not wife enough. Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm. Okay, you listen to me now. Okay? Yes, you're a superwoman, but you're also a human woman. Okay? And you are doing awesome. And Miss Kennedi, or as the world will one day refer to her, Madam President, is living her best life thanks to you, okay? So be nicer to yourself, please. - Thank you. I love you. - Mmm-hmm. I love you, too. Now... So, Camille's hostididy ass, right? - You, girl... - Oh, girl. - ...Camille was in the... - Babe, I can't. I can't. I... You know I usually would, but I have to get to this walk-through. I'm already runnin' behind. No, I get it. You're too good for it today. No, I get it. You tryin' to namaste in a peaceful space. And I'm about to ruin that, so let me just see myself out. ♪ I love you, I love you I love you ♪ You're welcome for this free coffee. I paid $74.93 for that. - No, you did not. - I will Cash App you. - Stop. All right. - I will. I will. I will. All right. And I wanna remind you to be good to yourself, okay? - Be kind to yourself. - All right. - Be kind to my friend. - I will. - I love you. - I love you, too. All right, I'll see you downstairs. Bye. Girl. Ms. Henley? - Yes? - Delivery. Oh. The front desk didn't even call. Who are these from? V! Oh, my God. Sarah Bee! I'm so sorry. I did not mean to scare you. It's okay. I have just been so jumpy this morning. I guess it's travel or something. Okay, I love you, but I have to run to my panel "The Exorcism of the Unconscious Past." Ah. "The past is never dead." "It's not even past." You know, my nana used to say, "Our ancestors haunt our dreams "to see themselves forward." The unresolved past can certainly wreak havoc on the present. Listen, have an amazing panel. You're gonna be incredible. - I'll see you later, girl. - I'll see you tonight, babe. Love you. Hi. Can I please make a reservation at Stefano's tonight? Concierge. Of course. Working on it as we speak. What can I do for you? May I make a reservation for three at Stefano's? Um, let's say around 7:30. And I'm in the Jefferson Suite. Sure. God bless. Oh, shoot. Puddin', I left my key in the room. Do you mind? You know, I learned very quickly that black people, black women in particular, we're expected to be seen, not heard. Or we risk being perceived as threatening to the patriarchy. Or, God forbid, we continue to get branded as the "angry black woman." Yes. So, the coping persona has been this mode of survival for generations of oppressed people. What I also learned through those experiences is within our authenticity lies our real power. Yes. And that's even in those environments, which by design, demand our complete and total assimilation. To the patriarchy, we've been practically invisible. But their arrogance is their greatest vulnerability. And our greatest opportunity. Yes. And it brings me to a quote by Assata Shakur. "The only thing that we have to lose "are our chains." Liberation over assimilation. They're stuck in the past. - We are the future. - Yes. Our time is now. It's now. Right now. Just a reminder, you can pick up Shedding the Coping Persona on your way out. Twenty percent goes to HBCU schools including Louisiana's own Dillard and Southern Universities. The way that you talked to them, the nuance, and there's a specificity that I just can't... Oh, my God. That was fantastic. So sorry. That was really great, you know. I really enjoyed my session, but I'm really glad I stayed for that. - Wasn't that fantastic? - It was. - Camille, this is... - I'm sorry, did I interrupt? - No... - I'm gonna continue to. I really have to steal her. Sorry to be abrupt. - I'll call you. - Okay. Thank you again. I'm just gonna finish up work and get back to... Bye. - Thank you, love. - Great. Bye. - Hey. - You're welcome. Girl, I could feel her angling in on our dinner tonight. And no thank you. She needs to go sit down some place. Plus, we could use a break from academia. And also, how often do I get my V? Twice a year? - Maybe three times a year. - I know, I know, I know. Okay, I need you all to myself tonight. Okay? No filter. Full Dawn. Oh, she comes with a filter? Also, after dinner... Yeah. You know, when we leave dinner, it's on. We gonna be out in these streets body rolling. - Oh, dinner. Tonight? - Yes. I'm sorry, but I have a date with my king bed tonight. I won't be joining. Whack. Wow. No. I have a 6:00 a.m. flight. I promised Ken Ken I'd take her to Katie's birthday party. Okay. All right. It's fine. We will keep you abreast of all of our hoetivities via text anyhow. Please do. I wanna know everything. Girl, the hoetivity is gonna be popping tonight. Girl, meet me down here at 7:00 p.m. We'll Uber over, okay? Yes, 7:00 p.m. And I have to go get dressed. Oh, speaking of getting dressed, what are you wearing tonight? Do not come down here in mom jeans, okay? I need all eyes on our table 'cause I'm tryin' to fuck tonight. You are on board for that, okay? I won't disappoint. Bye, girl. Well, hi. Don't you look beautiful? Are you going to the 49th floor, too? Shh. You'll get in trouble for talking. I'll get... Oh. I'll get in trouble for talking? Okay. Shh. Okay. You rang, darling? Girl, I said "Step it up," not murder these hoes. Mmm-mmm. Okay. Here's a new concept. What do you think? Instead of a "fuckboy," it's an "inti-mate." Okay, I love everything about it. It's someone who's gonna feed me ice cream and knows how to soothe my childhood trauma. It doesn't sound like you need to take a Plan B with that guy at all. - An inti-mate... - I just want somebody to snuggle me at night. - That's all I want. - You deserve. - Is that so much to ask? - You can call me. You're a great snuggler. - I am a great snuggler. - Oh, my God. What are you smiling at? Who's that? Well, you know it's Nick. Let's see. Dick pics or no? Aw. Yeah. See, here I thought marital bliss was an oxymoron. Guys, I can 100% confirm that Nick is not that perfect. Trust, okay? - But he is kind of perfect for me. - Yeah. - Ugh. Girl, she ruined it. - There it is. I thought there was tea coming. I miss my babies, okay? I'd miss him, too. "I miss my baby. - "Oh, he's so perfect for me." - Please, guys. "He's so perfect for me. "He's my lobster. "He's the Chandler Bing to my Monica." "He fits perfectly in my little box." "Like a puzzle piece." Yeah, no, we're very happy for you, bitch. - All right. Time to live in the present. - Okay, babe. - Yeah. - Okay, okay. Damn. - Oh, my God. Okay. - Shit, are you okay? Holy... Hi. Henley for three, please. We have your table. Follow me. - Enjoy your dinner. - Uh-uh. No, no, no, no. Sorry, I think what my friend is trying to say is that... Actually, babe, I got it. This table is 100% not acceptable, and I think that you know that, don't you... ...Becky? Mmm-hmm. Listen, I'm actually not gonna go back and forth with you about exactly why this table's unacceptable. You're gonna seat us over there. Oh, um... Thank you so much, Rebecca! You're doing great! Yo, get your sis. The Caucasity! - No, this is good. - Well, then you're welcome. - Welcome. - Hi. - Wine list. Hi. - Thank you. My name is Sam. I'll be taking care of you this evening. - Will a fourth be joining you? - No, just us. Very good. And may I start you off with a cocktail? Actually, we will share a bottle of champagne. How about a nice bottle of prosecco? A bottle of Armand de Brignac, please. Thank you. Okay, but more to the point, do you have any apt prospects for the night? Mmm. Booked and busy, actually. Actually, okay, so there's this, um... Ooh, I've been trying to set up a meeting with this guy, Justin. Fine. Just like a dark chocolate, like a 72% cacao, you know? Just... Chef kiss. - Is he fine? - Yes, he's fine. - Mmm. - And he's got a friend. - For me, a friend? - Yeah, for you. - Mmm. A friend? - Mmm-hmm. I don't know. That sounds sort of suspicious. Like, it can't be good. I feel like you're leading me into the snake den with this. Girl, I'm sure he's fine. - You're sure? - Oh, my God. - You're sure he's fine? - You haven't even met him? No, I haven't met him. Nope. This is exactly what is not happening. - I am too grown for this. - It's not... Okay, you're too grown. No, got it. I feel blocked. I do. And that's okay. 'Cause you're grown. That's cool. It'll just be you and me tonight and I will meet up with fine-ass Justin some other time. And maybe his friend, too. Hey. Okay. Do not look. There is a guy at the bar... I said don't look. ...that has been staring at us the entire night, and it's creeping me out. Excuse me, ladies. Before we order entrees, I wanted to let you know that the gentleman at the bar sent this drink specifically for you. Oh. Specifically for me. Oh, my God. He's coming over here. And he's coming this way. Okay, all right. Pardon me, ladies. I've had my eye on you. I just had to come by and tell you that I think you're quite stunning. Oh, thank you. Oh, gosh, I'm so flattered, thank you. You are extremely handsome yourself. Thanks. However, um, I'd be remiss if I didn't take the chance to sort of critique your game just a little bit. I'm sure that you can tell, even from all the way over there, that we're actually drinking champagne tonight. I am a champagne lady, and we are champagne ladies. So, sending over a vodka-cran, yeah, it just shows lack of appreciation for our situation tonight, so... Well, what you should have done is you should have asked our waiter, which, again, champagne we're drinking, and sent over a second bottle of it for all of us. And then, you make eye contact with me from across the room. You eye-fuck me. Oh, my God. And I say all that to say, Oop, here's my number. Because this can happen. Good night. Oh. Why did you do him like that? You know why I did him like that. He needed to know. Okay, I'm sorry, but can we just take a second to acknowledge that that guy was supernaturally fine. Yeah, he was really cute. So? I'm cute, too. That's true. - You are cute. - Yeah. Hey, to being cute and classy. - Yes. To being cute. - To being fine as fuck. Well, I definitely look forward to catching up on this saga. On a group text, in my bed. Very safe move. Wait. Although, this hotel has been so off. The front desk. They didn't clean my room. So, I'm not even holding my breath for turndown service. It's probably a mess. Really? That's so strange. My service has been impeccable. I got the Uber, but I can't believe we're splitting up. - I know. I'm so sorry. - Oh, no, no, no. Before we split up, we have to take a selfie. - Oh, yes. - Let's get a picture. Because it did not happen if it didn't happen... - You are right about that. - ...in a selfie. Where's my lipstick? - Girl, you look fine. - Your lips look fine. No, but I put it in there. - I could've sworn. - Come on, come on. - Okay. - Get ready and... - All right, that's it. - Tag me in that. One-take wonders. Everything. I love y'all. Thank you so much. One moment. - Love you. - I love you. I'm so proud of you. - I love you. Get home safely. - I love you so much. All right. I hate I have to go. I have to get home to my baby, though. Say hi to the family. All right. Love y'all. Watch her. - You watch yourself. - All night. - Watch her. - You're gonna be in trouble. - Bye. - Bye. Goodbye. Is this our car? This is us. Let's go. The Montgomery Hotel, please. I think I put it in. And do you mind turning that down just a bit? Thank you. First off, that we are some 5-star ladies. Aren't we, sister? And I just wanted to comment that you look like a 5-star gentleman. - Don't touch him. - Is that too much? - Don't touch him. - I know. - I wanna have five stars. - It's too much. I feel like that was too much. I shouldn't... I'm sorry, Gus. I'm so sorry, Gary. Hey, put your... Can you turn that up? - Hello? - Hello, Veronica? Who is this? ♪ Blame it on my juice ♪ Blame it, blame it on my juice ♪ Come on, alto. ♪ Ya-ya eee ♪ Wait, hold on, yo, hold on. ♪ Ya-ya-hold, ya-ya-hold ♪ This is Autumn, your Uber driver. - Oh, there must be... - I'm outside of Stefano's. Yeah, there must be a mistake. I'm in my car right now. I'm outside the restaurant. No, there's a mistake. I'm here now. - Okay, whatever. - Thank you. Ma'am, do you mind turning down the music, please? Hello! Turns out, this color does look nice on me. Help! Help! What do you want? It's 3:00 a.m. The arrangements are already being made. Now, look, the ballot box will go our way. The court will follow one way or another. It's under control. Is there anything else? Oh, really? If I see her pathetic husband on the news one more time parading around that little girl... Mouthy darkies are a plague. I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it. I said I will fucking take care of it. Eden? Eden? They will never take you away from me. What'd I say? What the fuck did I say? I told her yesterday she got one pass. Now she thinks she can come down to the fields whenever she goddamn pleases. Well, she will learn her lesson today. Girl, go get her. I can head up there, sir. Who gave you permission to speak, boy? I gave myself permission to speak. Tonight. We go tonight. I'm here. No, no, no... - Are you ready? - Let's go. Wait. Wait. Well, I'll be damned. You're killing me, man. Hey, dude, what the hell? Hey, is this yours? No, Purcell, you know I know the rules, man. No cell phones. - You fucking cuck. - No cell... What? Don't say my fucking name out here, Daniel! I'm sorry. I don't fucking want it. All right. You should have seen your face. Yeah, I'm mad. I mean, she's talking to me all the time. Well, no, you gotta stick up for yourself, all right? - I know. - You can't expect every... What was that? Well, it came from that direction. Fuck! Man, you scared the shit out of me. Oh, what is it? The spooks got you spooked? It's nothing, man. There's no one out here this late. Look at that moon, though. Beautiful. Yeah. Well, enjoy it, snowflake. Fine, you traitor. Yeah, yeah, write about it in your diary, Romeo. I need to piss, man. I'm gonna take a piss. Let me get these fucking things off. Daniel. You're not supposed to say my fucking... - Get the damn phone. - Got it. Oh, shit. Listen, if I don't make it, the world has to find out about this place. It has to end tonight. I know there's service at the cabin. Let's go. Come on. 911, what's your emergency? What's your emergency? My name is Veronica Henley. I have been kidnapped. There are so many of us here. We're on some sort of plantation. I'm sorry, ma'am, you're breaking up. I need you to send help right now. Did you say "plantation"? Hello? Hello? We need his face to unlock this phone. That's the only way we can send our location. I got you. No fuckin' loyalty! Eden! My name is Veronica! Open your eyes, motherfucker. I said, open your motherfuckin' eyes! Hello? Nick? V? V! I'm okay. I'm alive. V, no. No, no, no. Tell me exactly where you are. I don't know, but I'm getting out. Oh, my God. Everyone has been searching for you. I can't talk right now. I need you to call the police, now. I'm gonna send you a pin. - Mommy! - Oh. - Okay, okay, V. No. - Baby. - No, stay with me. - I love... Hello? Come on. No. No, no, no. Professor. I'm sorry. This doesn't end here. We're nowhere and everywhere. What the fuck are you doin' out of your cabin? It's the general, sir. He's hurt. - Please come quick. - Wait. - Come quick. He's hurt. - God! Oh, God. Oh. Jesus Christ. Senator? Senator Denton! Sir? Eden! Hey! Eden? Eden, open this door! Shh. Please, open the fuckin' door. Open the door. Jesus fuckin'... Eden, open this fuckin' door right now! Open the door! No, Veronica! Veronica, Veronica, listen to me. Please. Veronica! What the fuck is she doing? Open that fuckin' door! No! Get it off! The hell is that? Go on, mount up! Let's go! Get, girl! Get! Get, girl! Eden! Get, girl! Eden! Eden! You're not gonna get out of here alive. Now, why can't you just accept that? Accept what you are. You are nothin'. You ain't nothin', but a cotton picker. You think you're better than us, but you ain't better than me, you fuckin' cunt! My father kept insistin'. He said you were spreadin' such filth! I told him you weren't worth the risk, but he couldn't resist. The movement be damned! He just had to have you. Every single one of you I picked, except for you. His favorite girl. Now, of course, like always, it's up to a woman to clean up the mess of a man. Eden? Get your black ass out here! Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! What kind of woman are you? Get, girl, Get. Go, Daphne. Get, girl.
