[Gophers chirping] [Fire crackling] [Rock music begins] Hello fellow students. Haha For the first time ever, I'm your host, Greg Young, for the school radio Unfortunately the last host is in the slammer after that weird incident with... Uh... The Stabbing But I'd just like to take this opprotunity to welcome all of my fellow freshman as we begin our careers at this wonderful university Ah. And now, time for your morning jams [Rock music intensifies] [Soft piano music] What did you say? I think it's best if I leave now Don't you? No, no, no. Before that you said something about leaving, what was it? Goodbye, Will No, that wasn't it She broke up with me I know Your girlfriend, Calamity, broke up with you last week I heard you the first hundred times Can we talk about me now? She broke up with me... My date with Suzy went perfectly dreadful, thank you for asking I just don't know what went wrong Me neither, she wouldn't put out at all What? Oh... I'm... I'm sorry, Izzy. How did your date go with... What was her name? Sally? It went great, thanks What's on this sandwich? [Izzy] Hot sauce And that's not a sandwich, that's a cookie You OK, Will? Yeah, I'm fine... Gimme that! Didn't Calamity give this to you last year? No Listen. As your best friend and your roomate, I've got to level with you You're seriously starting to bum me out Remeber the date I brought over the other night, Jennifer? Yeah Well, she spent almost the entire time comforting you and not making out with me She was sweet Yeah, but so bad in bed You're missing the point I am? Yes! You have to get over Calamity, man. It's been a whole month! We've been dating since freshman year of highschool How do you expect me to get over four years just like that? I used to suck dick freshman year You grow out of these things! It's not the same thing I've got an idea Follow me Leave it! I said, leave it! It was an anniversary present, come on From Calamity! Exactly! That's why you can't have it It's toxic for you It's like a hot iron around your neck burning the idea that you might get back together with her into your mind Yeah, but we might get back together See! Wait Is that my... Is that my phone? How did you get that? Honey, pickpocketing you is like taking guns from a liberal Have you heard of Tinder? Yeah Well that's exactly what you need Someone to help you get over Calamity I don't know... Come on! It'll be great Ok, we just have to update your account... Wait, you... already installed it on my phone? Yeah... It's easier to get the straight ones if I pretend to be a guy at first Wait, you... you pretended to be me? How often do you have my phone? I'm your roomate, not a saint Here! Profile picture! Hey! Youch... Maybe not that one... OK, here Eh, OK Uh... Describe yourself I'm lost My life has no purpose She left me and now I have nothing left I'm just a loose collection of Punk-emo song lyrics and a future in alcoholism Working at a dead-end job until and inevitably early death... How about "six-four" OK, and? Oh, that's it I'm not even that tall [ding] Hey, you've already got a match Yeah, but isn't she dating that guy from Alpha Alpha Alpha? [Frat Dudes in distance] Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! Maybe, but trust me she gets around and boy can that girl... Yeah... Yeah... That's enough... Thanks Enough? Come on, you can't give up yet! What about... Cheryl Thomas! She has a dog, that's an instant turn on right? Nah, her nose is too big That's like the hundredth time you've said that! Not all their noses can be too big I'm sorry, but I'm not just going to give up on Calamity I still love her She might still come around Give me that! I'm going to put this right here, under the skull of Andrew Jackson And you better not touch it You remeber what happened last time someone touched my prized skull You made out with them? No! After that You had sex with them? Before that! I think I'm lost I gave her a black eye, Will. A black eye Calamity has such pretty eyes Ugh, you need to get over her! I have an idea You know the yearly bonfire put on by Alpha Alpha Alpha? [Frat Dudes in backyard] Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! Stay the hell out of our yard! It'd be perfect You could throw the necklace into the bonfire and be done with it It's metaphorical or something You like that kind of shit, right? I don't know, that doesn't sound like a very good idea At least think about it, OK? [Will] Nope So you're not stalking Calamity? Nope Really? Because it looks like you're using my spy-ear to listen in on her conversation Why do you even have this thing? That's besides the point Anyway, have you given any more thought to the whole bonfire thing? Shh, shh, she's talking [Izzy trailing off] I just think it would be really good for.... Uh, huh Uh, huh So where is this bonfire thing anyway? Huh Ok, yeah. I'll... I'll see you there [Snapping] [Izzy] Are you even listening to me? Yeah, um... Yeah I think your bonfire thing is a really good idea Really? Because just a minute ago you said... Yeah, yeah, I know. I wasn't thinking clearly I think it'd be a really go idea for me to go and... uh... Burn the necklace? Burn the neckalce! What are you talking about? I mean... Yeah, yeah, uh I think that's a really good idea. I'm glad we're on the same page now Me too, I think it's really good that you're going to go There's no way you're going I've asked everyone I know These Alpha Alpha Alpha... [Frat Dudes in distance] Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! These... Triple-A events are really exclusive If you don't get an invitation there's no way you can go All my contacts in the fraternity are... Angry at me to sya the least There's got to be someway to get them to notice me That's it, I've got an idea Alpha Alpha Alpha... Alpha! Alpha! Alpha! Don't you have anything better to do? Anyway, the fraternity is putting on a talent show If you win, they have to invite you Izzy... You know I can't perform in front of an audience Not since... The incident You know you have to You're right [music intensifies] But this may be the hardest thing I've ever had to do You know? It wasn't that bad Not at all. You really surprised me I didn't think you could give such a touching rendition of "My Heart Will Go On" Yeah Hey... Uh... [Will] Uh Will Whatever I just wanted to let you know that... Uh... Those weren't tears during your song I... I had something in my eye Well, I'm glad you liked it Can I go to the bonfire? Do you have any idea what you're asking? Our holy order does not take kindly to outsiders like you Come on man, there's something I can do You live with that Izzy chick, right? Yeah I want to teach her a lesson I want you to steal her skull Her skull? The skull of the Andrew Jackson that has been passed down in her family for generations Why? What did she do to you? I'd uh... Rather not talk about it That is literally the one thing in this world that she cares about She brags about it to everyone What could possibly justify me stealing it? She uh... She slept with my girlfriend [Will] What? She slept with my girlfriend God... She'd hate me Well if you want to go to the bonfire, that's what you've got to do Fine, fine, I'll do it OK And you better bring it Or else Well? How'd it go? I'm in [Piano music begins] [Izzy] What are you doing? Uh... Nothing You're stealing my skull Yeah Frat dude said I couldn't come to the bonfire unless I stole your skull Something about wanting revenge for you sleeping with his girlfriend Oh yeah... But... This is serious You, my only confidant Are stealing my skull My family heirloom, the skull of Andrew Jackson The only thing in this world that I care about [Izzy] Take it What? You need to get over Calamity and if this is going to help you do that, then Take it But you owe me and you know that is not something that I take lightly [Izzy] It's just a stupid piece of platsic anyway [Intense piano music begins] [Fire crackling and people chattering in the background] [Greg over the radio] Hello! I'm your host, Greg Young And I don't know about you, but I am getting excited Halloween is just around the corner and in celebration Joshua Andrews is throwing a Halloween party and all are invited Maybe I should throw a party sometime In recent news Dr. Stanford is making a slow but steady recovery from her unfortunate stab wound earlier this year Keep her in your hearts as we play something a bit more relaxing for her This one's for you [Will] Come on out here, Calamity!

Time for revenge No. It's about 5 a.m. on a wednesday [Izzy] You frantically texted me, telling me to come help Burn this bitch to the ground You see there was a change in plans I couldn't find a lighter That's probably for the best, your breath smells flammable Did you drink all of those? Well, you see I can drink a lot of beer over the course of two weeks But yes, I did drink all of that last night Who gets drunk off beer? I'm allowed a vice or two Or twenty Hey, I am over Calamity, fire rain down upon her What else do you want me to do? I don't know! Maybe not commit attempted property damage [Izzy] And I may have some bad news for you This is isn't Calamity's house It's not Calamity's house? What are you... Shit Sorry about that, ma'am. Just got to get him back to the mental institution Isabelle? That's my name. Do I know you? It's Lily From high school? How could you not remember me? [Lily] Huh You know... You meant more to me than any other person I'm glad to know those feeling were reciprocated Uh... I'm... I'm sorry Screw you You know? All things considered That could have gone worse [Will] Let's get out of here Yeah [Intense music begins] [Dull thud] [Dull thud] I swear, Will. Throw one more and we are going to find out which is gonna break first This bottle or your head Sorry about that Izzy. It's just It's the only thing I've found that will get you out of that walking coma you've been in since this morning Well, what do you want then? I was just wondering, could you like Set me up on a blind date with someone you know or something? I'm not sure I know any blind girls Ha ha. That's very funny, but I'm serious I'm moving past Calamity Strike her with lighting And I'm ready to put myself back out there I'm not cupid. Why don't you just use Tinder? [Sigh] Nobody mayched with me... Well, I can't do magic, Will I don't need magic I'm just a little out of practice You're just gonna have to get a girl to fall for you the old fashioned way [Both snicker] Ok, fine, fine The girl I'm going on a date with tomorrow has a straight sister I don't know if she's single, but I can ask if she's interested in going on a double date How's that? That'd be great, but I thought you said your date was tonight? [Softly] Shit Are you sure she's not blind? Izzy, we're here [Sigh] Don't you dare! Worked, didn't it? Come on, let's go. We're already late I just... don't know what the problem is. I'm just so nervous It's understandable This is my first date with someone new in four years I'm more nervous than I've ever been Well of course you're nervous, but this is me we're talking about The poets write epics about my conquests. I don't just get nervous Maybe you're becoming more like a normal human Just don't mess this up for me, OK? [Will] You haven't even told me anything about these girls What's to tell, they're eligible and cute At least give me something... Like a name Whitney and Brittany! Now let's go, we're gonna be late I just said that [Whitney] And that's when I said At how acrobatic your mother is [Awkward laughter] [Will's deafening lonliness embodied by a laugh] [Brittany] Anyway, I feel like we've been doing all the talking Why don't you tell us a little about yourself? Um... Can I have just a second, with my friend? Um... S... Sure Sorry Will, this is important What? What is it? Which one is Whitney and which one is Brittany? Brittany's the one that... No, Whitney's wearing... Oh god... You can't remember either? Well, what are we gonna do? Maybe they don't know our names? Is everything alright, Izzy? Oh, you know my name So... What are you... What are you studying? What am I studying? I am... Studying... Names! And I... Definitely know yours I... I never forget people... Ever Huh... So... Haha... What are you studying, Will? I'm actually really glad you asked that, because it is really interesting [It wasn't] So I study a very particular area of history that studies... [Eerie music] Excuse me [Whitney, I think?] What's this bitch's problem? Sorry about that [Intense piano music] Izzy, what's going on with you? Is it that girl from this morning? The one whose name you couldn't remember? I just... I don't get it. What is wrong with me? How can I affect someone that much and not even remeber them? I meant the world to her, and I couldn't even remember her name [Sigh] I have been with a lot of women Are all of them out there right now just hating me? Is that the price I have to pay to just have a little bit of fun? Why? I... It's not like I lie to them They should understand that it's just... Casual What's so wrong with that? Izzy... I... I don't know what to say [Sigh] Well I totally ruined tonight for you so I'll talk to her and I'll get you a proper date [Will] Izzy And I'll learn her damn name You know? I've got an idea It's nothing revolutionary, but... You know that Halloween party that's this weekend? I feel like it would be really good for you to go and you know... Unwind, forget your problems [Sigh] You're right, it can't hurt [Party music begins] [Sounds of people chatting and having a good time] You seem to pretty to be a wall-flower Come dance with me [Music fades out as the fountain grows louder] It's weird seeing you without your hat No! I like it Aw... Thanks This is actually kind of cute I'm glad you think so. My roomate thought I was crazy I like it I haven't been to a library in so long I can't believe I've been missing out on such classics as What to say when you talk to yourself Thank you very much [Both laugh] Are you ok? Have you ever... Hurt someone And felt like there was nothing you could do about it? Like... Maybe if they just felt how you felt, or saw what you saw It would be alright, but They don't. And it isn't I have, yeah I just... I don't know what I'm doing wrong I'm not a bad person, I just... Do what I do and people get hurt It's not your fault You don't control people's feelings You don't make them care for you They make that decision all on their own The only thing you can do Is just Be yourself And know that one day That'll be enough I had a great time tonight, Will Give me a call some time [Magical lesbian music begins] Izzy is that you? Remember when you said you owed me for the skull thing? Yeah? [Magical lesbian music intensifies] [Birds chirping] [Greg over radio] Hello! And this is a special broadcast from me, your host, Greg Young I would just like to invite everyone to a house party I will be throwing in two weeks time. There will be plenty of pizza and beer so stop by and have some fun [pen clicks, paper crumples] [Greg on radio] Also, the student board would like me to remind everyone that stabbing your professors willl not excuse you from midterms and that Dr. Stanford is expected to make a full recovery from her second set of stabbing wounds [paper crumples] [Greg on radio] Thank you, and have a marvelous day What is this? What is what? This monstrosity that you've cursed our table with. Ohhh, that. That's just something I picked up from the thrift store the over day. Table felt like... Just felt like it needed something. Yeah, you know what? You're right. It does need something. I know exactly what it needs. But since that is lost in the forest somewhere among the embers of a certain bonfire I just really don't think that this belongs here [scoffs] That's really rich You trying to tell me what does and doesn't belong here Because I can think of a really good example of something you brought home recently that doesn't belong What? Will, can I have a word with you in the kitchen please? [Izzy sighs] Will, I... [Izzy sighs again] I have just been having a really tough couple of weeks and... I'm not saying that Calamity is the answer to all my problems but... she... makes me feel good I... really need somebody like her right now No offense I just need someone more than a friend right now Things just... Aren't the way they used to be Things that used to make sense to me... Just don't anymore I feel so... unsure of myself But this... This makes sense to me One of Calamity's famous notes Are you even listening to me? [Mockingly] I cooked something for dinner tonight [disgusted] Love, Calamity Can you not read those? They're private Why doesn't she just text like a normal person? Will, listen I've known you for years. Your friendship is really important to me but this relationship is important to me, too And I just need to know that you can handle it Okay, look. It's just... it's really weird. My best friend and my ex-girlfriend... like, together? Dating? Like, I... I just need some time, okay? So you're not gonna be a dick about this? When have I ever been a dick? Okay, fair enough... But... [Will sighs] I'll be okay, alright? Will! Will, wait up What? Slow down! I have to get to class. You don't have another class today Don't you just have to wait for me to drive you home? What's wrong? [Will sighs] Nothing's wrong Is it because Calamity was in class with us? We were just holding hands! Well that was some pretty damn sensual hand holding! Sensual? What are you even talking about? You said you'd be okay with this! Well... Look, you're doing it again! Get a room. You are impossible. Izzy... Impossible? This is not about you and Calamity Will... Maybe this isn't the best time No. You know what? I think this is a great time What is it about then? It's about the... It's about the... That's what I thought. Why can't you just get over yourself and be happy for me? Should I leave? [Will] Yes! [Izzy] No! It's fine. I'll just catch you later, okay? Let's just hang. You and me. Will's just being rude right now Me rude? I am not the one who betrayed my best friend Please... I can just come by later... No, we are figuring this out right now Will, wait What do you two want? Really, I should just go Will, I did not betray you. You said you were over her Look, I'm trying You said you were over her! Well maybe I lied, okay? Look. You kept telling me that I needed to get over her, and I am trying my hardest but my feelings for her aren't just going to go away overnight and it doesn't get any easier if she's around here all the time Well... That's... Just the way it has to be right now Look... I want to feel happy for you but it's just... Calamity, you know what I'm trying to say, right? Shit. [Bittersweet piano music begins] [Izzy sighs] Izzy? [Will sighs] [magical lesbian music begins] [fountain bubbling] Calamity. Calamity... I'm... so sorry about that I don't know what came over him Calamity... My parents made me enroll here. What? [Bittersweet piano music plays] I wanted to go to USC [water splashes] But... they said I'd never get in So... They sent me here Calamity... What are you talking about? I don't think I can be the person that you want me to be What do you mean, who you want me to be? I heard you talking to Will in the kitchen this morning... and I'm so afraid that I-- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry about Will I know he hasn't warmed back up to you yet... But, he will He just... Needs time Izzy... You said yourself that you can't control sombody else's feelings It's not your fault that Will's mad at you You are... amazing And Will knew that at one point and now I do You mean so much to me, Calamity I just... Don't want Will to get in the way of that He isn't I'm glad I... I've gotta go We're still having dinner together later, right? I... I think so. Yeah [cars come and go] [phone rings] [Izzy's voicemail begins] Hey bitch, leave a message Hey Izzy, it's Will... Um... I'm sure you didn't forget, but I'm waiting at our normal pick up spot Uh... If you could please hurry... It's getting pretty cold Uh, give me a call whenever you get this, I guess [voicemail beeps] Hey bitch, leave a message Hey Izzy. I'm sure you didn't forget me... C'mon [voicemail beeps] Hey bitch, leave a message Hey Izzy. It's your old pal Will... I just wanna let you know... I totally forgive you for forgetting me Just... Please hurry up. It's getting really cold out [voicemail beeps] Hey bitch, leave a message Hey Izzy... I'm freezing. Please... [voicemail beeps] Izzy... [voicemail beeps] Izzy! [Voicemail beeps] Izzy... [voicemail beeps] [Will sighs] Izzy... I'm gonna walk home now [shivering] I s-swear to God, if I f-freeze to death I'm gonna h-haunt your ass f-forever [car approaches] Calamity? Get a phone! [Hopeful piano music plays] [Izzy's fingers tapping on table] [somber piano music plays] [phone rings] [voicemail beeps] Hey, it's Will. If you're calling I'm probably busy. Leave a message, I guess Hey, uh... Have you seen Calamity anywhere? Just... wondering Call me if you see her, I guess [Izzy sighs] [dramatic piano music plays] [owl hoots, crickets chirp] [door opens and shuts] Will? Izzy God, Will, am I glad to see you I've been calling you! Why didn't you pick up? I'm sorry, why didn't I pick up? That's rich I was just wondering if you'd seen Calamity anywhere She was supposed to have dinner with me and then she never showed up No. I haven't seen her Why would you bother calling about something like that? You should have just texted. It would have been easier for me to ignore I know... I just... I wanted to say... that I'm... sorry for not coming to pick you up It was stupid and childish... and there's no excuse for it I'm sorry, Will No, you know what? I gotta go You just got here Yeah, something came up Okay... See you later... [door opens and shuts] [Izzy exhales] [Izzy sighs] [hopeful piano music plays] William I still love you, Calamity Will... That is not what I wanted to talk to you about [Calamity sighs] It's about Izzy Izzy? No... No no no. This is about you and me [Calamity sighs] There is no you and me We are... done But why did you break up with me? I thought things were going so well [exasperated] It's not about you, Will Everything is... changing Things that used to make me feel... good... just... They just don't, anymore Couldn't you feel that, too? [Calamity sighs] You and me... It just didn't... It didn't feel right [dramatic piano music begins] You still have that? Yeah... Izzy wanted me to burn it... at that bonfire, you know I just... I couldn't bring myself to do it You were at the bonfire? It's just... I keep thinking that if I hold onto it tight enough, then maybe... it'll bring you back to me It just it... it feels like a connection back to the way things were Back when we were all... happy [hopeful piano music plays] Growing up sucks, huh? Yeah... [Calamity sighs] Anyway... About Izzy... and what I wanted to talk to you about... [Calamity] I don't think... [Izzy] Will Izzy? What are you doing here? What am I doing here? You son of a bitch [slaps] Okay, look. I can explain. Nothing happened Calamity, why? She didn't do anything, okay? Oh! So I just guess you wrote this note to yourself then, huh? You know, in case you were wondering, this is what real betrayal looks like You couldn't just let me be happy with her Oh, get off your high horse All of the women in the world and you have to fall for Calamity You get to be a slut up until the moment it has to do with somebody I care about Why couldn't you just keep your gay little hands to yourself? Izzy... I ... I didn't mean that No, I think you did mean that I think you mean that you think I can't keep my 'gay little hands' off of any woman that I come across You know... I expect this from everybody else and they can call me a slut... and a whore... and a dyke... but from you? [Calamity, hysterically] Izzy! Izzy wait! [The sound of owls and crickets fill the night] [Song begins] [Singing] I walk with flowers in my hair [Singing] I walk with birds singin' in my ear [Singing] I dance on rainy days [Singing] I laugh my pains away [Singing] I love with all my heart but that don't make me silly [Singing] I don't wanna be your manic pixie dream girl [Singing] I ain't just a little stop on your adventure [Singing] I don't wanna be your manic pixie dream girl [Singing] I'm a free spirit. That means free from you [Singing] You walk with such a serious air [Singing] Letting the world know that you just don't care [Singing] And maybe you're sad, or maybe you're lonely [Singing] Or maybe you're just a little mean [Singing] Either way it's not up to me [Singing] To show you the light [Singing] Either way it's not up to me [Singing] To fix your broken soul [Singing] Either way it's not up to me [Singing] Don't you know I'm broken too [Singing] I don't wanna be your manic pixie dream girl [Singing] I ain't just a little stop on your adventure [Singing] I don't wanna be your manic pixie dream girl [Singing] I'm a free spirit that means [Singing] I'm a free spirit that means [Singing] This is my journey you're just one wrong step in it [Singing] And I'm only trying to free me [Greg over radio] Hello everyone! It's me, Greg Young Not that anyone seems to care No one showed up to my party I had ten pizzas that went completely uneaten I am disappointed in you all Anyway, I... I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving break Those of you not visiting family stop by the cafeteria for a special Thanksgiving meal Thanks and have a good day Did you put all of this up last night? Yeah... Just... Think of it as a goodwill offering It's Christmas, you know? The time of forgiving and forgetting It's not even Thanksgiving yet Have some shame And that hat looks stupid [Izzy screaming] You put them outside too? Calamity, you have got to get Izzy to talk to me That is the most conversation we've had in two weeks Will... I don't know how to say this nicely So I won't I don't care I didn't get any sleep last night And now... I have to go make sure that Izzy doesn't tear the decorations off the front of the house [Calamity sighs] God... Izzy really was my only friend [Soft piano music begins] [Phone ringing] [Whitney on phone] Hi, it's Whitney [Whitney on phone] Hello? [Whitney on phone] Hello? Oh... Hey... Hey... [Phone ringing] [Whitney on phone] Hello? Whitney... Whitney, It's me, Will [Whitney on phone] Will? [Whitney on phone] I... Um... [Whitney on phone] Uh... Now's not really a good time Well, when would be a good time? I'd love to catch up with you [Whitney on phone] It's been like... A month [Whitney on phone] And I've heard nothing from you, Will [Whitney on phone] I don't think there is a good time at this point What do you mean? [Some asshole on the phone] Whit, who is it? [Whitney on phone] One second [Whitney on phone] I... I gotta go. Bye [Phone disconnects] [Will sighs] [Izzy] I don't see why we can't just celebrate one holiday at a time Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas In that order I mean, after Thanksgiving it's whatever. It's fair game Stores can sell whatever the want, but I just want to celebrate Thanksgiving. Is that too much to ask? You've been quiet lately. What's going on? [Calamity sighs] You could have been nicer to Will this morning What? He was just trying to make the place a little more festive It just annoys me is all [Calamity sighs] Well he just put up some lights. It's not a big deal I wasn't gonna take them down. I just don't want to wear the stupid Santa hat Well you didn't have to be so angry I'm not! You were Fine. I'll wear the stupid hat if it means that much to you I'm not even hungry Calamity what's wrong? [Izzy] Calamity! [Will] Hey Calamity What's wrong with her? [Izzy] Leave! Come on, Izzy. Just talk to me Fine! I hate you. I hope you die How's that? [Piano music begins] [Will screaming in the stall] Why? [Will screaming in the stall] Why did I do that? [Will screaming in the stall] Why am I so stupid? [Will crying in the stall] Izzy... Will? Is that you? [Will] Greg? [Magical theme begins] [Izzy sighs] [Twig snaps] [Greg] Well damn... I gotta say it You're a dick A huge dick Whose side are you on anyway? I was just lashing out 'cause of the Calamity thing. It's not like I actually meant it Did you even apologize to Izzy? I got her a Santa hat So that's a no... I don't know what to tell you, man I just... I need Izzy back. She's my only friend I mean... Except you of course You just need to apologize to Izzy [Will sighs] Maybe... What about Calamity? Do you think there's still a chance there? Well... [Toilet flushes] [Sink running water] Excuse us We are trying to have a private conversation Ugh... [Paper towels being used] [Bathroom door closes] Anyway... I think you just need to be patient And maybe Calamity will come back around to you one day Just gotta wait and see how thing play out That's it See how things play out! I've got to go get Izzy's spy ear Not quite what I ment by patience... Dude, what are they doing? Shh, shh They're not saying anything. I think something's wrong Do I want to know how you found them so quickly? No [Soft piano music begins] I think we need to break up Calamity Calamity, if... If there's something wrong then I wanna fix it You are... The most important person in the world to me Izzy, no Calamity, please... Izzy, stop I'm tired of you idolizing our relationship like we're Romeo and fucking Juliet [Izzy] If this has something to do with Will then we can... Izzy you don't get it! [Calamity] I am not some perfect dream girl here to just magically solve all of your problems [Calamity sighs] I am not and... never have been the person you want me to be for you [Calamity] You've been using me to feel better about yourself and it is... exhausting I really like you, Izzy, but... I'm tired It's... It's over [Izzy] Calamity, please don't go I think it's best that I leave now Don't you? Please Goodbye Izzy Dude... Now's your chance Calamity is still emotional She needs a shoulder to cry on Sweep in. This is your opprotunity No... Well... Suit yourself [Will] Izzy Go away Look, me and Greg were over there We heard everything Are you doing alright? Listen Will, I just need some space right now, OK? [Greg sighs] Didn't go so well for you either, huh? Nah, she said she needs space I just... I don't understand. It feels like everybody that I care about is slipping away from me Dude, look Back in high school I was a total loser I mean... Nobody would talk to me Nobody would hang out with me Except for you And now look at me. I mean, I'm hosting a radio show... Well, what I'm trying to say is, you know We're all changing That's what college is It's all about trying to find who you truly are And, you know, that's what Izzy and Calamity are doing too People change Relationships change with them It sucks, but... Sometimes you gotta just take it It'll get better on the other side [Will sighs] Look, so... Back when Izzy used to have a really bad break-up She would always tell all the things she hated about the girl to her little skull Help get things off her chest I just... I wish I had something like that That's it! I know how to make it up to Izzy Wait, what? You do? Yeah, I just gotta go back to where the frat held that bonfire and get her skull back Wait, isn't that location a super frat secret or something? Don't they blindfold everybody that goes there Yeah, but I know where the frat forest is, like... It shouldn't be too hard I gotta go So next week I'm throwing another party It's gonna be really cool, you in? I... I don't know if I'll be free, but we'll see, alright?

I'm busy I have a date with Brittany Whitney? No, Brittany Whatever, Will went to the bonfire to try and find my skull That idiot You're the only one that can lead me to him Why in the world would I do that?

All I have ever been to you Is a means to an end We're turning around But...

I was so focused on getting Calamity back And I ended up hurting you Please forgive me [Izzy] Great.
