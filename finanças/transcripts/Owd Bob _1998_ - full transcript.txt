(gentle music) (engine rumbling) (gentle music) (Zac barking) (gentle music) - Quiet Zac, quiet. Quiet. That'll do. - Mr. MacAdam? - Aye. (sheep bleating) (Zac barking) - I'm Janet MacPherson, Social Services. (cow moos) (birds chirping) (Janet laughs) It's a long way to come up here Mr. MacAdam but you don't answer your mail. - Come on Zac, come on. (sheep bleating) (birds chirping) - I'm sorry about your daughter and her husband. It must've been a terrible loss. (sheep bleating) I've come about the boy. Look, he's got no one else. The fact is David needs a home. (cow moos) (birds chirping) (sheep bleating) Somebodies got to take responsibility for the lad. If you don't take him in he'll have to go into foster care and he is your grandson. (Janet sighs) Well, there's nothin' else for it then. I'll notify the authorities in America. (cow moos) (birds chirping) - Mrs. MacPherson? I'll take him for the summer. - Oh, that is good. I can have him here a week on Friday. I'll meet him and I'll put him on the tram from Douglas. Cheers. - Aye. (car door slams) (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) (tram rattling) (upbeat music) (town members chattering) (upbeat music) (tram exhaust hissing) (tram bell dinging) (birds chirping) You must be David then? Let me give you a hand with that. - No, it's okay I got it. - Well, come along then. We have a ways to go before we get home. This is Zac. - Hey Zac. (Zac barking) - He doesn't care much for strangers. (Zac growling) (birds chirping) Come on Zac. (thunder rumbling) (crow cawing) (gentle music) (thunder booming) (waves splashing) (gentle music) David, come on. (gentle music) (seagulls squawking) (man chattering) - There he is! We want a wallop with you MacAdam! (men chattering) (seagulls squawking) That animal of yours is a menace. He went for my dog. - He was trespassing on my land and so are you. Be off with ya. - Peter's right MacAdam, we've a problem here. We have to talk. - That car of yours hurt my dog, and I want satisfaction damn it. - Oh, I'll give you satisfaction Peter Quail, anytime you bloody well please. (seagulls squawking) - We'll have the law on you MacAdam! (thunder rumbling) - Don't you threaten me. I keep my dog close. You look to your own dogs. - Aw, come on. (thunder rumbling) (men chattering) - What's goin' on? - Aw, he's in a pig of a mood anyway. - Young man's doolally. - What's the problem Adam? - Nothin' to do with you Moore and I'll thank you to keep out of it. (Zac barking) - That dog has a temper to match yours. (thunder rumbling) (seagulls squawking) (gentle music) - Close the door. I don't want the dog to go out. (door latches) (birds chirping) (logs clattering) (birds chirping) (match flicking) - What dog is that? (fire crackling) - That was Samson. Finest dog I ever owned. (sheep bleating) (fire crackling) Are you hungry? - Just tired. It's been a long day. - Well, you're the first door on the left up the stairs. - Thanks. (Zac barks) - Easy, easy. - Goodnight. (gentle music) Hm. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (rooster crowing) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (door slams) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (water splashing) (pump rattling) (crow cawing) (birds chirping) - Well don't just stand there. Make ya some tea. Kettle's on the stove and tea and the pot are on the table. (crow cawing) (sheep bleating) (water splashing) No. No, no, no, no. No, nevermind. Let me do it. (water splashing) (crow cawing) (birds chirping) (water splashing) Sit down. (kettle thuds) (Adam sighs) - So, what's there to do around here? I could help you out if you want. (Adam chuckles) - Could ya now? (cow moos) Well then I guess you could shear the cow and milk the sheep. - Look, I'm offerin' my help. You don't want it just say so. - All right then. Sit down. Sit down. Eat your breakfast. Later on we'll see if we can't find something useful for you to do. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) Go on, go on. Go on. Wait, heel. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (lamb bleating) (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (upbeat music) Do that side. That's it. Easy, easy, easy, easy. (upbeat music) Let go, let go. Well done, well done. That's good. (birds chirping) (sheep bleating) (Owd Bob panting) - How you doin'? - Hi, I'm Maggie. Maggie Moore. That's Owd Bob. - Hi. I'm David Roberts, Mr. MacAdam's grandson. - My father said he's met you. - Saw me maybe. My grandfather wasn't exactly big on introductions. - I don't think he likes us much or Bob here. - He doesn't like anybody much near as I can figure. - You're American aren't you? (Maggie giggles) - Yeah. What, do you think that's funny? - No, just different that's all. (sheep bleating) What are you doing here? - I'm fixin' the wall. (Maggie laughs) - Yes, I can see that. Sorry, I meant what are you doing here on the Isle of Man? - I'm just here for the summer really. - I live just over the hill. Would you like to come for tea? - I can't. - [Maggie] It will still be here tomorrow. The wall. It will still be here tomorrow. You might at least walk me home. That won't take long. (birds chirping) (sheep bleating) - Sure. (rocks clattering) (gentle music) So, how long you lived on the island? - All my life. - Really? You never lived anywhere else? - Uh uh, wouldn't want to either. - Huh. Speaking of which where do you live? I thought you said it was close. - It is. It's just over the hill. - Oh. (gentle music) - Come on. (upbeat music) - Hello Bob. Hey. Maggie, where have you been? - This is my father. Dad, this is David. - I believe we almost met last week. - [Maggie] Mr. MacAdam's grandson. - [David] Hi. - [Keith] MacAdam lookin' after you then? - Yeah. Will you stay to tea? - Oh, I think I'd better get back soon. - Come on David, just for tea. - All right. - Don't be shy David. (plate thuds) - They're really good. I made them. - Oh, you made them. I had way too many sandwiches (chuckles). (Maggie gasps) (all chuckling) - [Maggie] The nerve. - I'm just kidding, I'll try one. (tea splashing) Why is he called Owd Bob? He seems young to me. - You're right, he is young. He's only three. Here fella. Come on (tongue clicks). Bob get his name from the gray hair around his collar. Soon he'll be a champion just like his dad, won't ya? - Champion of what? - The sheepdog trials. Every year the finest dogs in Lezayre compete against each other. - They have to drive the sheep from the field around a course and then into a pen. The winner is the dog who can do it in fastest time. - Making the least number of mistakes. Let's not forget that small detail, huh? - I think that I'll just go upstairs and lie down for a bit. Oh, too many snacks this afternoon spoiled my appetite. (chair screeches) (birds chirping) - Aren't you going to eat it? - Yeah, of course. (gentle music) (sheep bleating) (tool thuds) - Damn boy. David? (gentle music) - And this is the Andreas Trophy. Bob won it last year. - Who's this? Battle, grand champion 1992 and 93. - A direct descendant of Samson's line. It was Battle who sired Owd Bob and Zac. That was Samson. He belonged to my grandfather. - Wait a second, my grandfather said Samson was his dog. - His dog? - David's quite right. Samson did belong to Adam at one time. - You never told me that. (fire crackling) (seagulls squawking) What happened? - Oh, it's not a happy story. - I'd like to hear it. (seagulls squawking) - Your grandfather's never really forgiven us. Perhaps for good reason. - He wants to hear what happened. So do I. (seagulls squawking) - Adam MacAdam leased his holdings from my father. When he took on the property he was a young man with no more to his name then a new bride, a small flock of sheep and a dog, Samson. As fine a dog as anyone had ever seen. He worked hard to buy the farm but he run into hard times. His wife, your grandmother was pregnant and not well with it. Half his sheep got sick and then died. Couldn't keep up the payments. - But he's still there. - So what happened? - My father wanted Samson. He thought if he could get that dog he could begin to breed a new line, one that would win the championships. Adam knew this. My father hounded him demanding he pay what he owe. Your grandfather loved Samson, but he loved his family more. My father took the dog. (gentle music) (seagulls squawking) (Mr. Moore sighs) (gentle music) (sheep bleating) (seagulls squawking) (gentle music) - Thanks for coming. - Thanks for having me. - It was a pleasure. - The scones actually were good. (David laughs) (Maggie laughs) (gentle music) (seagulls squawking) - Listen, I'll see you tomorrow. Maybe show you the old tower. It's haunted. - Yeah, like I believe that. - It was worth a try. (birds chirping) - I'll see ya. - Yeah, bye. (birds chirping) (clock ticking) (owl hooting) (plate clattering) - You had a job to do and you didn't get it done. - Yeah I know, I'll finished the wall tomorrow first thing. - Aye, you'll do that and you'll stay away from the Moore's and their daughter. You'll have nothin' to do with them. Do you hear me? Nothin'. (clock ticking) (owl hooting) - Because of something her grandfather did years ago? It's not fair to blame her. - What do you know about fair? - Keith Moore gave you Zac. Doesn't that count for anything? - Gave him to me? Is that what they told ya? (Adam chuckles) Got an earful of stories didn't ya? Gave him to me. Zac here were the runt of the litter. Hardly worth drowning weren't ya? They couldn't give him away and that's the truth of it. Not that a Moore ever gave anything away. No. I bought him fair and square and I made a champion of him. He's won that trophy two years in a row and when he wins it a third time it'll be mine to keep. No other dog has ever done that, won it three times in a row. Not in 100 years. And I'll have done it with a runt. (clock ticking) My Zac's worth 10 of Keith Moore's Bob. (clock ticking) (fire crackling) And I meant what I said. You stay away from them Moore's. All of 'em. (gentle music) (bed creaking) (gentle music) (clock ticking) (gentle music) - Good boy Bob. He'll take the cup this year won't he Dad? - Oh, I think he might and we'll bring it back here where it belongs, eh? (Keith chuckles) - I'm going to bed now. - Goodnight, Mom. (fire crackling) - Goodnight dear. - Night. (fire crackling) - How can you even think of sending her away to your sisters? - I don't want to send her away. I just don't know if I can take of her if... - If what? (Keith sighs) If I die? I believe I'm gonna get well. I need you to believe that too. - I do believe it. - Do you? So why are you makin' these contingency plans? - Well they're not contingency plans. - What would you call them? (Keith sighs) It's not just about sending Maggie away. You want me to talk to her as well. What am I going to say Keith? I'm fighting as hard as I can. I can't do it on my own. I need your support. (Keith sighs) (crows cawing) - Zac? Zac? (Adam whistles) (crows cawing) Zac? (Zac barking) (cow mooing) Zac, come here. Come here now. Zac, what have you got here? (door latches) (sheep bleating) Got himself dirtied up last night. Out hunting rabbits I expect. That's why I asked ya to close the door. After you clean out the stalls I want you to get to work finishing that wall. - Sure. (sheep bleating) (crow cawing) (water splashing) (birds chirping) - I really think we need to put you on a course of chemo therapy. - It made no difference at all with my mother. - We need to try every option. - You need to try some positive thinking. - [Doctor Southam] I wish there were more I could do for you. - There is something you could do for me Dr. Southam. Keith is determined to send Maggie off to his sister in London and I want her to stay here. He won't discuss it with me much less argue but he seems to think that she'd be better off there. Look, we've still got the best of the summer ahead of us. I'll rest, eat well. By the time the school term starts we'll all be laughing at this drama. I promise you. (birds chirping) - Listen Dad, I know Mom's been ill but, well that's all the more reason for me to stay here. - Those points need changin'. - I could be a help to her until she gets better. - Listen, it's not such a terrible thing goin' away to school. You'll make friends, good friends. You might even learn somethin'. - But there's no need for it. - I'm your father Maggie. I'm just tryin' to do what's best for ya. - I don't care. I want to stay here. - Maggie? Maggie? (sheep bleating) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (horn honks) (engine rumbling) - Keith? We got the petition up. - We'll be wantin' you to sign. - Well, what petition's that then? - A formal complaint against Zac. We want the animal put down. - Now how would it look it I signed something like this with the trials coming up? MacAdam would just think I was trying to get rid of the competition. - Well, what do you care what he thinks? - There's no need for that. - Try the police. See what they make of it. - Mrs. Stewart, I come to pay me bill. - Oh, hello Keith. How's Heather? Is she keeping all right? - Oh, as well as can be expected Mrs. Stewart. - Oh. - I'll her you were askin' after her. - Please, please do. Thanks. (men chattering) (birds chirping) (door latches) - Heel, heel. - David got home all right? - Aye. - He's a fine lad Adam. - He'd be a lot finer if you let him get on with his work. - To be sure. Still, he's welcome in our house whenever he pleases. - He'll not be comin' to your house again. And I'll thank you to keep your daughter away from him too if you don't mind. - Why is that then? - Why? Because it pleases me. - They're only children. - Aye. Still. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (cows mooing) (gentle music) - [David] What are you doing here? - You weren't at the wall. - I've got other things to do Maggie. (sheep bleating) Look, if my grandfather finds you here he'll kill me. Please. - Where is he? - He's in town. (cows mooing) Hey, where are you going? - I've never seen inside. - Maggie, he'll be back any minute. You can't go in there. - [Maggie] Oh come on, I won't be long. (birds chirping) (David sighs) - Pretty sparse, huh? All right you've seen, can we go now? - I'm not going to stay, David. It's just that I need, I need a glass of water. (David sighs) (pump clanging) (crow cawing) - Sorry, the pump doesn't work. (Zac barking) (Owd Bob barking) Oh no. - Bob! - Get back! (Zac barking) (Owd Bob barking) What was she doin' in the house? - She wanted a glass of water. - Well I want her out of here. (Zac barking) (Owd Bob barking) - The dogs coulda been hurt. - I want you off my land. (Zac barking) If you come back agayen, I'll sick the dog on ya. - It's not your fault David. (cows mooing) - Her and that dog. He's a coward and a sneak that one. You can't trust him, I'm tellin' ya. He's bad to the bone. He'll bite ya in the leg when your back is turned just like his father, the great Battle. (David scoffs) (cows mooing) Didn't I tell ya that I didn't want ya seein' that girl? Now you listen to me young man and you listen well. As long as you're in my house you'll do as I say. If that's not agreeable to ya, you can catch the next plane back to America. (crow cawing) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - You okay Bob? (gentle music) (birds chirping) Hi. - Hello. - [David] Maggie around? - She just run off over the hill. (David sighs) - She came over to my grandfather's. The dogs nearly got into a fight. - Aye, so she said. I take it your grandfather was upset. - Yeah. I can't visit here anymore. He's asked me not to so. - Well, despite his faults he is your grandfather. I admire loyalty David. Maggie'll miss ya though. - Yeah. Could I ask you one thing before I go? - Sure. - My grandfather keeps saying that Bob is just like his father, Battle. What does he mean by that? - Battle killed sheep David. He was one of the best dogs I ever had but he was difficult. About two years ago a number of sheep were killed. I didn't wanna believe it, not of Battle, but it happened more than once when he was out. All the evidence pointed to him. Then one night he came home with blood on him. I found two lambs dead next morning. (birds chirping) I had to put Battle down. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. - Was that the first year Zac won the cup? (Keith smirks) - The trials aren't important David. Not in the scheme of things. A cup is just a cup whatever your grandfather thinks. - Yeah. Well, maybe I'll see ya again before I go. - Aye. I'd like that David. If you wanna talk to Maggie, I'm sure Bob can find her for ya. Here Bob. - Thanks. Come on Bob. Go find Maggie. (sheep bleating) (birds chirping) (gentle music) Come on Owd Bob. (sheep bleating) (gentle music) (Owd Bob's collar clinking) (gentle music) Hi. (gentle music) (birds chirping) I'm really sorry about what happened today Maggie. - It wasn't your fault. (gentle music) My father wants to send me away to his sister in London to school. I found out this morning. - You don't wanna go? - My mother's been sick a lot lately and, I don't know, I guess maybe he thinks he can't take care of me or something but, you know, I feel like he's just trying to get rid of me. - That was what my mother thought when my grandfather sent her away. She thought he didn't want her. - Does she still feel like that? Is that why she didn't come with you? - She's dead Maggie. She was killed in a car accident. My father too. - Oh David, I'm so sorry. (David sighs) - I can't see you anymore Maggie. I really want to but I just can't. - Why? - Because of the way my grandfather feels. I'm, I'm really sorry. Please understand. (gentle music) (Maggie sighs) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) - That petition will get MacAdam's notice. Depend on it. - Talk of the devil. (door latches) (men chattering) - [Bartender] Afternoon Mr. MacAdam. (patrons chattering) - You ought to burn that dog. He's killin' sheep. (Zac whimpers) - You have no proof. Until you do, keep your bloody opinions to yourself. - He's a vicious killer and you know it. - Maybe he is. At least he's no coward. Not like some I could name. (Zac barking) At ease. (patrons chattering) (upbeat music) (bystanders chattering) Now that's called the out run. He'll run out in a nice pear shape all the way to the fence, then along the fence to what's called the lift. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) And then together. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) Right? And then the fetch will bring 'em down into the first set of gates. What he gets down to the gates that'll be the drive. Now, you wanna drive 'em straight. Come on man, come on man. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) Here he comes through into the trailer. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) - Up, get up. Up. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) - Now he'll pen them. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) (Adam whistles) (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) (Adam whistles) (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) (Adam whistles) (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) (Adam whistles) (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) Back, back, back, back, back, back. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) Lie down. (upbeat music) (sheep bleating) He'll do. That'll do. Come on. That'll do. (birds chirping) (sheep bleating) (somber music) (birds chirping) - Promise me Keith. (somber music) (birds chirping) - Aye. - I could've asked for anything. (somber music) (birds chirping) You'll be all right you two. Don't worry about me. I'm going to be fine. (somber music) (birds chirping) (bell tolling) (birds chirping) (David sighs) (sheep bleating) (bell tolling) - Away Zac. (bell tolling) (birds chirping) Out you go. Zac? (bell tolling) (sheep bleating) (thunder rumbling) Just where the hell do you think you're goin'? (thunder rumbling) (bell tolling) - I have to do this. (bell tolling) (thunder rumbling) - Zac, here. (somber music) (singers vocalizing) (engine rumbling) (sheep bleating) Get down now. (sheep bleating) (cow mooing) (David sighs) (cat meows) (sheep bleating) (birds chirping) (cow moos) (birds chirping) (bag rustling) (hay thuds) (David grunts) Well, what are you lookin' at? - I was just wondering. - Wondering what? - I was wondering why you didn't go to Mrs. Moore's funeral. - Why should I have done? He didn't come to my wife's funeral. I'll be damned if I'll go to hers. - You didn't go to my mother's funeral. - Bite your tongue! You really think I didn't wanna be there? Look here lad, you just don't drop things and walk away from a farm you know? There's work to be done every day, no matter who dies. - [David] Mr. Moore would've helped you. - Ah, to hell with Keith Moore. It'll be a dark day when I ask a Moore for help. - Why do you hate them so much? - Why? Because they took my life from me. They took my dog. Working their bloody farm killed my wife. Because of them I lost my daughter. - You didn't lose her, you sent her away. You didn't even write to her. - Aw, what are you talkin' about? Of course I wrote her. I wrote her somethin' every week. And when I finally bought this farm I asked her to come back. I begged her. - 10 years after you sent her away. - That's right, damn you. 10 bloody years. 10 years workin' this farm alone to get the title off of that old man. I did it for her, for us so that we'd have something that no one could take away from us and what was the thanks that I got? She didn't want anything to do with me. She didn't wanna leave her friends, her family. - She was 14 years old. - Ah. She made her choice. To hell with her. - To hell with you. To hell with you! (hay thudding) (sheep bleating) I hate you! I don't blame my mother for not wanting to come back. Not one bit. She hated you and now so do I! (sheep bleating) (birds chirping) - David! (birds chirping) (funeral attendees chattering) - [Woman] Something to eat love? (funeral attendees chattering) Have a little something to eat. Have something again Timothy, you'll feel the best. - I say we talk to him. - Oh behave. You can't ask him something like that. Not today man. - I can. I'm sorry for your loss Keith, but it's the times like these that we should really stick together. Would you agree? - You haven't signed the petition. We'd be grateful for your support. (Keith sighs) - You have got a poor sense of timing. - You have no evidence Zac took down those sheep. None at all. Now you can ask MacAdam to collar his dog if you like, but I'll not consent to having Zac put down. - I bloody well saw him attack my dog. - Your dog probably asked for it. (funeral attendees chattering) (birds chirping) (funeral attendees chattering) - [Woman] She was devoted. She and John were called to. Lord's might he expressed. Don't know what John would do now. (woman speaking faintly) (funeral attendees chattering) - You wanna go for a walk? (funeral attendees chattering) - Dad, we're just going for a walk. - You all right love? Okay, be back before dark. (funeral attendees chattering) (sheep bleating) - You all right? (Maggie sobbing) (dramatic music) (Owd Bob whimpers) (dramatic music) (David panting) (Maggie panting) (Owd Bob barking) (Maggie laughs) (Maggie sobbing) (birds chirping) It's all right to laugh Maggie. It doesn't mean you'll forget her. (Maggie sobbing) (birds chirping) - I knew my mother was sick but no one said anything. I didn't know she was going to die David. If I'd known there are things I could've talked to her about. - I think like that sometimes too. I wish I'd known but... - What happened? - It was an accident. A drunk driver ran into us. (birds chirping) They were both killed. I was in the backseat and actually we were just talking about coming here for the summer. My mother was turned around in her seat, she was facing me. She was so happy. (David sighs) She was telling me, she was telling me about the island. How much I'd like it here. - She was right wasn't she? You do like it here. - Yeah, yeah I like it here. My grandfather on the other hand, that's another story. (David sighs) Come on. (birds chirping) (owl hooting) - Here's an extra blanket. - Thanks. - You found those awful pajamas he put out. - Well, it was either them or one of Maggie's night dresses. I know which I'd prefer. (David laughs) You know, I'm not at all sure I'm doing the right thing here. - I'd be sleeping outside right now if you hadn't let me stay. I can't go back. Thank you both. - Aye. Oh, there's a new toothbrush on the bathroom sink and fresh towels. - Goodnight. - [David] Goodnight. - He's very brave isn't he? - So are you. - I don't know what it would be like not to have anyone. I'm awfully glad you sayed yes. (fire crackling) (clock ticking) (owl hooting) (clock ticking) (Adam sighs) (glasses thudding) (owl hooting) (clock ticking) (Adam exhales) (Zac whines) (clock ticking) (wind whistling) (owl hooting) (clock ticking) (birds chirping) This used to be my favorite. I didn't know she kept it. There are so many things I'll never know. Things we could've talked about that... Why didn't you tell me Dad? You must've known she wasn't going to get better. - She was a fighter Maggie. Telling you would've meant she'd given up the fight. - I don't want to but sometimes I, I feel really angry. - Maybe we were wrong not to tell you. I'm sorry Maggie. We did what we thought was best. - I miss her. - Oh, I miss her too. (Keith exhales) (Maggie sobbing) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (sheep bleating) (gentle music) (door latches) (gentle music) (clock ticking) - Your things are upstairs where you left them. - I didn't come for my things. - What'd you come for then? - I came to apologize. - Don't bother. - I'm sorry, I sayed some things I didn't mean. - That doesn't matter. - It matters to me. I wanna stay. - Well you can't. - Why? (sheep bleating) (birds chirping) - Because I'm too old. I can't care for ya, I don't know how. - You don't have to take care of me. I can take care of myself. - No, David. No. It's done. I've uh, I've called Mrs. MacPherson. She's making the arrangements. Go on now. Now go upstayers and get your things. (sheep bleating) (clock ticking) You can go back to the Moore's if you want. I'm sure you'd rather be there anyway. Go on now. (gentle music) (sheep bleating) (alcohol splashing) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - I'm really sorry it didn't work out between us. I don't hate you. I feel sorry for you. You never got to know my mother. She loved you. She wanted you to know that. (gentle music) That's why I came. (gentle music) (door latches) (gentle music) (clock ticking) (Adam sniffling) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (sheep bleating) (Zac barking) (sheep bleating) - Hey Blake, do you fancy that putters dog? - What, Ace? - Yeah. - No chance boy. Not on me six legs. (all laughing) (patrons chattering) - Evenin' Mr. MacAdam. Pint? - Mm hm. (patrons chattering) (alcohol splashing) - MacAdam? Where's that dog of yours? - He's at home, what's it to ya? - He's not. He's out. I just found one of my lambs savaged by a dog. It were Zac. - You're quite mad Peter Quail and blind as well. I know what you're up to and it won't wash. Zac never killed a sheep in his life. - It was that dog of yours I tell ya. I saw him take off across the Dail. - You saw nothing and you're a liar. - I'm a what? - Peter calm down. - You arrogant! - Come on will ya? - Hey. What's going on? - MacAdam's dog's been killin' sheep. - Don't be throwin' around blame Pete. - I saw him. It were Zac. Can you swear to that?

I'll just make sure Maggie and David are okay. - I wanna stay here. I know Mr. Moore would let me if you'd just ask him. - It's not as east as all that. There are laws about the care of minors. You're not even from here David. You're an American. I expect if you stay in touch with the Moore's they'll have you back maybe next summer. (David sighs) (birds chirping) You have a week or so yet. It'll take me awhile to make all the arrangements. (Janet Sighs) Oh, I'm sorry it didn't work out for you David. But there's nothin' else for it.

There was another dog. I saw it from the tower, all of it. Bob tried saving the sheep. He went after the other dog. - It's all right David. - No, you have to believe me. It's true. - There was no other dog. - Yes there was. - Come on. - Ya have to believe me. - Better gather up the sheep. - Bob didn't do it. It's the truth.
