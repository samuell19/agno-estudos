"Welcome to New York" is the greeting on top of that fifth Avenue bus. Welcome to the city of contrast, the exciting harbor, the serene statue, the turbulent roar of Broadway, and the peace of central park. Tall buildings standing like sentinels on guard over its playgrounds and museums. This is riverside drive, uptown. Nice, isn't it? This is tenth Avenue, downtown. Not so nice. It was down here they tell a story typical of this city of contrast. It was down here I first met a kid they called the tenth Avenue angel. The year was 1936, one of the depression years. Hey, you, will you keep out of the street? Why? It's my street. Watch your car, mister? Yeah, watch your car? No, thanks. It's only a quarter, mister. Uh... well, uh... On second thought. Now you're smart. Yeah. You better not let your mother catch you working that business. Aw, shut up. Your old lady! Give me that money. Here, Flavia, give it to them people tell them we're sorry. All right. Where you going? Mister! Mister! "With her apologies," Mrs. Masten said. Uh-oh! Well, it's her street, her neck. Ok, Skeeter. Paper, paper, read all about it. I got 'em, Mac. And soaking wet, I suppose. Only the outside ones. Man, I suppose wasn't for you, I'd go out of business. Oh, phooey. You don't need anyone. Mother says you see more than half with their eyes open. You see through them, and that's important. Oh, she does, does she? And you're a very wise man, too. Oh, am I? What do you read? Your bark's worse than your bite. Who said that? - I did. - Hmm. Should I read the headlines? Sure. What are they? Dutch Smith-- Bumped off. There. You know without me reading. Hmm, anybody could see that was going to happen. - Mac. - Yes. Steve's coming home. Steve? That's fine. I always believed in Steve, always did. It's nice to believe, isn't it, Mac? It's a good thing. I don't see, but I know what things are like. I know what the street looks like. And I know what you look like, too. - How do you know? - I know it inside. That's how you know things. I guess that's the way I know things, too. Like a 4-leaf clover, that's lucky, or a horseshoe, but it has to have a nail in it. Mac, where can I find a 4-leaf clover? Round here you better look for a horseshoe. When you see a white horse and you wish on it, it comes true? You can always wish. Sometimes it comes true. Oh, but it always does. My mama said so. I have to go now, Mac. Best of the afternoon! - Good-bye. - Bye. Paper, paper. What do you read? They're all late. Hello, Teddy. Don't let my mother catch you doing that. Why not? Cause she'll put salt on your tongue, then you won't get it back again. Ah, you're crazy. I am not. I'm 8 years old, and... That's normal. Now, let me by. Hello, Flavia. Hello, daddy. Daddy, do you have time to discuss - something important? - Well, not right now. I've got to go give a music lesson. Talk to your mother. Good-bye, Helen. Oh, good-bye, Joseph. Your feet wet? Mm-mmm. Mama, who went to school last, you or aunt Susan? I'm 3 years younger. I guess I did. Well, then listen, aunt Susan, London is the capital of England, and the Andes are the highest mountains in south America, and the Chinese are members of the magnolia race. Mongolian, honey. Magnolia is a flower. I didn't think it sounded exactly right. Darling, what are you getting at? Well, Steve's coming home from being all the way around the world, and I'd like to be able to talk about the trip with him. Don't you think you need to do your homework? You really want me to do it, or want to get rid of me? To be honest, little of both. Now, run along. I don't know why there's so many secrets here. I'm a member of this family, too. Brother, what'll she do if she finds out Steve didn't go around the world, that he's been in jail? We've kept it from her so far. What are you going to do about it? Help him to forget, show him in spite of what happened, I love him more now than before he went away. I'm sure he couldn't love you any more than before. If he doesn't propose to you right away, I'm afraid Flavia's will do it for him. She's decided that you and Steve ought to get married next Thursday. When did she decide? She's been talking about you two getting married for the last year or so. Before then, she had another idea. Such as? She was going to marry Steve herself. Oh ho ho! There's a hen in Wisconsin that laid a triple-yolked egg. Hmm, that's something to cackle about. Does it seem like the trains are running kind of slow this morning? Hmm, now that you mention it. Maybe he won't know me. I'm 2 inches taller and almost a pound fatter, but I'm wearing the same dress. I was scared to ask mother if I could wear it, but she had it all ironed when I woke up. And very becoming. Mac, look, there are people getting off! Steve! Steve! Steve! Hey, Flavia! Hey there, sweetheart! Oh! Hey, hey, what's going on here? I'm crying. You're crying? What for? Because I'm so happy. Crying because you're happy. Oh, that's the silliest thing I ever heard of. Come on, honey. How are you, Steve? We'd have rolled the carpet if we knew you were comin'. - Hello, Dan. - Hiya, Mac. Walks the same, talks the same, shakes hands the same. - How does he look? - The same, only better. We missed you, Steve. The whole street missed you, every single solitary person. I wish I could believe that. I can speak for the boys, Steve. - Well, how are things going, old timer? - Fine, fine. I can't complain. - Can I check my trunk here? - Sure, sure. I'll be back for the afternoons, Mac. - I'll look in on you later. - So long. Oh, Steve. It was rough getting sent up on your first job. My last job. We wanted to thank you. That's all right. No need to. We paid for our rides. So we're even. It was nice of you dumbing up like that. Me and the boys kind of had something figured. Give me one paper, Mac. Huh? I ain't got no use for them coppers. Come on, Steve. You've got to see everybody. Sure we have. So long, Mac. Ok, Steve. Paper, paper. What do you read? - Hello, Steve! - Oh, hello, Tom. - You know my little cow? - Belinda? She's got 37 cents in her stomach. 37 cents? Why, she's a plutocrat. What are you going to do with all that money? - Hello, Steve. - Oh, hello, Fred. Ain't they beautiful? Say, by golly, aren't they swell? I'll bet they got balloon tires and 4-wheel brakes. They got everything. Steve, did you ever want something more than anything in the whole world? Yeah. Hey, look, a white horse! - Did you? - Mm-hmm. Well, I better go up and keep my date with Susan. Ok. Come in. Steve! Hello, Susan. Welcome home, Steve. Let's see how you look. You look fine. Gee, so do you, but then you always did. Do you really think so? I always thought so. Let's sit down. Gee, Steve, it's wonderful to have you home again. Just like old times. Yeah. Would you like some coffee? Yeah, yeah, I'd like a cup of coffee. Ok. Have you seen Flavia? Oh, sure. She was down at the El station to meet me. Did she happen to mention anything about Thursday? Thursday? No. Steve, there's something I want you to know. I still feel exactly the same about you as I did before. Before I went to jail? Let's not say that word again ever. Ok. That's a deal. Flavia seemed to think that Thursday would be a good day to get married. I think so, too. I suppose a girl should wait for a proposal. But I guess I'm pretty anxious. Flavia's pretty anxious, too. What's the matter, Steve? Susan, it's... It's just that... For the past 18 months I've done a lot of thinking. The more I thought about it, the more I knew that it was no good. What was no good, Steve? Everything that has to do with a fellow that's just out of... Honey, you see, I'm not just an ordinary guy anymore. I'm an ex-con. I can't have a beer or drive an automobile. I'd have to report to some parole officer and say, "mister, I've been a good boy." But it'll be over in 6 months. And we'll be happy. That's all that matters. Sorry, lady. I saw you up the street talking to Dan Madson, didn't I? Yeah, I was talking to Dan. You're on parole. I was just passing the time of day with him. Look, abbutt, you made a nice living driving a cab, didn't you? I suppose I did. Then drove a cab when some boys knocked a freight car full of silk. For that you got 18 months up the river. Now you're out. Try and stay out. Don't worry. I'm going to stay out. Your own mother couldn't give you better advice than that. Well, there's the whole story for you. Oh, no, I'm not taking you on any honeymoon involving check ins with cops 3 times a day. That's why I'm leavin' town. Out of town? Soon as my parole is up. I got to begin all over again. In some strange place and by myself. I thought you loved me. But I do love you, Susan. That isn't the kind of love I care much about. While you're away in that strange town, you might meet somebody. Suppose somebody... Somebody here, he and I might get to like each other. Answer me one thing, Steve. Are you willing to take that chance? I have to. I guess there isn't very much else I can say, then. Know what, Steve? In Czechoslovakia, a wedding lasts 3 days. It does? I didn't know that. Well, you always told me when people get married, they're happy. Oh, did I? Flavia, let's not talk about it. What's wrong? You see, Flavia... You know, that's the same way Mrs. Murphy acted before she had a baby. Something's wrong with her, Steve, and please don't tell me I'm too young to understand. Sit down, sweetheart. The reason that Susan feels bad and I feel bad, worse than she does, is because, well, we're not going to be married. But, Steve, I got it all planned. I even got Mr. McCarthy for you. Mother says you have to have something new and old for the wedding, and I've got something old. Mr. McCarthy's 87. Yes, I know, darling, I know. He'd do fine, but... You see, I'm going to stay here for a little while, then I've got to go away again. But you've just been away. Where are you going, and who's going to look after you? I don't know, darling. I guess I'll have to look after myself, but all the time that I'm away, I'm going to think about you and Susan every minute, so that'll make it almost as good as though we were together, won't it? No, it won't. Flavia? It's just me, Mac, with the city edition. Here's 49 of them. I sold one on the way over. Here's the money. Want me to read you the headlines? Isn't there something else you'd like to talk about? Can't think of anything. Everybody tells me Steve looks good. Pretty good. Mac, I got troubles. Everybody's got troubles. - You're smart, aren't you? - Sure, I'm smart. It ain't because I'm blind, either. You wouldn't call a man smart because he's deaf. I just know a lot. I need some advice, an awful lot of advice from somebody smart like you. What is it? He's going away. Who's going away? Steve. I thought he and my aunt Susan were going to get married, - but he's going away. - Well, where's he going to? I don't know. He's leaving in 6 months, and he didn't say when he was coming back. Aunt Susan's will miss him. Hmm, I see what you mean. That's what I wanted to know. You know everything. Isn't there some way to keep Steve from going away? Sure there is. How? It's terrible important. Well, I got to think. Well, then think hard, Mac. Keeping Steve here shouldn't be too hard. Keep him happy. That's it. Keep him happy, and he won't leave. You wouldn't want to leave a happy place. No. That's why I like it here with you. There you are. But... how do I keep him happy? Well, give him a helping hand on everything he does. The first thing you know, he'll feel he can't get along without you. Oh, you mean like running errands for him and helping at the garage and stuff like that? That's it, Flavia. Gee, Mac, up until now I really didn't know how smart you are. All I need is a chance. You'll have to... What's wrong? I think I hear Steve's footsteps. He walks with a kind of a bounce. Hiya, Mac. Sweetheart, don't you think it's about time we'll go tie on the feedbag? Yes, I've been waiting for you. First I get my shoes shined. - I'll shine your shoes. - Oh, you can't shine shoes. I can shine them better than Mr. Torelli. Besides, he charges 5 cents a pair. Ha ha ha! Let's let Mr. Torelli make the nickel. All right, but I offered, didn't I? Yes, you offered. You know, I've just been telling Mac, there's an awful lot of things I could do. Oh, I'm sure there are. How am I doing, Mac? You're doing fine. Say, there's something going on here that I don't understand, we better go home before I catch on. - See you later, Mac. - So long, Steve. Glad to see you back, Steve. I guess I don't have to tell you I'm glad to be back. See the old place hasn't changed much. I checked into the parole board this morning, so I'm all set down there. Now all I have to do is see Charley for work. Charley isn't with us anymore. Oh, no? Who's doing the hiring and firing? I am. Well, good afternoon, boss. Good afternoon. So it's you I have to thank for the job. Mostly the big boss. I just called his attention to it. What did you have in mind? Well, now, you know you can't drive till your 6 months is up. You know how tough things are now, everybody hanging on to his job, and well... What is it? We had to rustle up something for you so you could get out, so would you mind starting in washing cars? Oh, gee, that's not the best job in the joint. But, well, I'm here looking for a job. I'm glad to get it. Sure. Soap and water, here I come. Sure, when this thing is over in 6 months, we'll find a cab for you. Well, let's talk about it then. Just a minute, will you, Steve? I think it's only fair to tell you I'm pretty crazy about Susan. I haven't been trying to beat your time, when I knew you were coming back, I told Susan that... I mean, I asked her to marry me. It's only fair to tell you. Well, thanks, Al. I'm glad you did. I wouldn't say anything about this to Susan. I don't think she'd like us talking. No. I was just going to suggest that myself. Well, I got to go down and pick up Flavia now. Oh, by the way, if she comes around here, and she probably will, she thinks I've been in Australia. I get it. Cynthia, did you hear that Steve's home from his trip all the way around the world? My father was away all last week. He was in Newark, New Jersey. Oh, but Steve, he was away a year and a half. He went everyplace. If I had known he was going to Australia, I'd have asked him to bring me a kangaroo. What do you want with a kangaroo? It can carry my books home from school for me. One cent. It's delicious. One cent. Hasty tasty ice cream. Get your hasty tasty ice cream, one cent. Got any money? Some. It's very good. How much? A penny. It's delicious. What flavors have you got? We have vanilla, strawberry, peppermint, purple, and all kinds. Pistachio? Not today. Let's try the fella down the street. His ice cream is no good. How do you know? He's my brother. Oh. I like peppermint. Oh, well. Give me purple and peppermint mixed. Oh, that's good. Gentlemen, if you'll step just a little closer. Now, gentlemen, I'm not here to sell you anything. On the contrary, I'm being paid a large salary by the super steel safety razor blade company to introduce their new product, a new safety razor blade that cuts your beard like hot butter. You shave, young ladies? Of course not. Then why are you listening? I've got books here, and I'm not reading. I think I hear your mother calling. You don't know my mother. Beat it. Why? It's my street. So instead of charging you 50 cents or even 25 cents for 3 blades, I'm being paid a big salary by the super steel safety razor blade company to give each one of you 3 blades for 10 cents, 10 cents. We don't want to make money. I'm going to take this dollar bill and place it inside one of the packages, so some lucky gentleman will get his blades absolutely free and a bonus of 90 cents. The dollar bills in the package. - We mix them up. - No, it's not. What did you say? I said the dollar bill's not inside one of the packages. Then where is it? In your pocket. You sure? You stuck it back in your pocket. I've got a magic book that shows how to. In spite of what this brilliant young lady tells you, I claim the dollar bill is in one packages. Let's open them up and see. - Takes time, sister. - I'm in no hurry. - Let her go ahead. - Give her a chance. That's right. I'll do better than that. I'll take another bill and place it inside of another package so there'll be no doubt, even in this young lady's mind. I'll put it in. Then I'll know it's there. That's fair. Sure. Go ahead. Now, who's going to get the lucky money? Who's going to be the first customer? I am. - You? - Sure. All right. Here you are. Let me pick it out myself. Give me 90 cents change, please. How did you know which one had the dollar bill in it? It was the only package with ice cream on it. Say, Steve, have you been down the garage yet? I went in this afternoon. It's all set. I go tomorrow. Did they give you a new cab to drive? The kind where the top opens up. Well, no, honey. As a matter of fact, I'm not driving a cab. I'm just going to wash them. Wash them? You're the best driver in the world. Oh, you say that to all the fellas. You even told me yourself that only one man out of 75 is temperamentally fitted to be a taxi driver. Oh, did I say that? Look, honey, it's like this. You see, all the taxis have drivers. It's not right to take the job from a man with 8 or 9 children. Only one man out of 60,000 has over 8 children. Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot about that. Even if he only has two children, it wouldn't be right to take his job. Well, couldn't you save up and buy a taxi of your own, Steve? Yes, I guess I could do that, but that would take quite a while, so in the meantime, I think I'll just washing them. But I'll wash them and Polish them up-- - A mouse! - Now, now, dear. But I'm afraid. Why, darling? They couldn't hurt you. Just the same, I don't like mice. But they bring good luck. How do they bring good luck? Oh, like turning into money. Mice turn into money? Yes. They do? They really do? They did when I was a little girl, if you wished hard enough. Like wishing for something you wanted more than anything in the whole world? Like that, yes. Steve, can anybody buy a taxicab? I guess so, if they've got the money. If he hasn't got the money. If somebody else gets it and gives it can he still get a taxicab? Well, certainly. A taxicab doesn't care who buys it. If he has a taxicab-- I mean, if he owns a taxicab, can he take it to another city and drive it? If he has a license to drive it here then he can only drive it right here. Why? Oh, nothing, nothing. Flavia, it's getting late. Get ready for bed. Ok, but don't anybody go. What do you suppose she's cooking up? We better all figure out some way to get Helen out of this Aesop’s fable about the mouse. Oh, no, that's all right. It's better to think a mouse turns into money than to scream her head off everytime. What about some hot coffee? Oh, not for me, Helen. A big fat mouse would turn into more money than a skinny one, I guess. Now you be a good little mouse and turn into lots of money. I'm going to give you plenty of time-- 3 whole days. Bye. Hey. It's on your side. Sure, right there. That's got it. Ok, roll her down. Come on, roll her down. Oh, got the door locked, huh? Well, did madam enjoy her ride? Oh, yes, indeed. I trust madam liked the scenery. It was beautiful. Ah, yes. There's nothing like Asbury park in the summertime. How much do I owe you? There's no charge, no charge. Now, will madam exit? Nope. Oh, yes, madam will. Ok, ok. All right. Steve, could we speak a minute? It's kind of important. Hi, Susan. Look at the fish I caught. - Hi, Susan. - Hello. You get back to work, and if there's dirt on those windows I'm going to toss you out. Steve, I just remembered, glass was first invented by the early Phoenician. Oh, I didn't know that. By the way, what are Phoenicians? Uh, Phoenicians? People who live in Phoenix. Ha ha ha! What can I do you for? I came to talk about the block party. Oh, that. Say, that thing's getting bigger and better every year. Steve, will you act as master of ceremonies this year? No, I don't think I better. Why not? You've done it half a dozen times. You're swell at it. You know that. Yeah, I know. It's kind of fun, and it makes a fella feel important, but I don't think I better. Suppose I'm up on the platform and some guy yelled out, "how are things up river?" Or "show us how you did the lockstep?" Or "how do you think the boys up in sing-sing are getting along?" No, no, I guess I'd better skip it. Steve, you're going away, and I'm going to remember you, but I'd much rather remember a big man that was booed off a platform than a little guy that was afraid to get up on it. Ice cream! It's so delicious. Yes, sir, Sonny. There you are. Thank you. Ice cream! It's so delicious. Ice cream! Here's a nice big one. There you are. Thank you. Be sure and don't get it messed up before the program. I won't, but I can show Steve? If you're careful. Here, hold up the train. Lemonade, sir? It's a dance I want, madam. Oh, I don't think I should. We're so busy. - Go on, mama. - Please? All right. Mrs. Murphy, would you watch the stand? Sure, sure. Go ahead. My, that's a nice costume you have on. Thank you. - Hello, Mr. O'Callan. - Hello, Flavia. There's my father and mother dancing. Gee, they don't dance a bit like parents. She looks very pretty. That dress is older than I am, - it sure don't look it. - Ha ha! Paper, paper. What do you read? Paper, paper. What do you read? Good evening, Mac. Mr. Chamber. Want a paper tonight? Not tonight. I'll take a magazine. Ok. See? - Thank you, Mac. - Ok. Paper, paper. What do you read? Paper, paper. Hi, Steve. I've been looking for you. I haven't been hiding. I've been right here. I certainly helped you this morning getting the booth ready and everything? Yeah, you sure did. You couldn't have gotten along without me. No, I don't see how I could. I'm nervous. Aren't you? Yeah, I'm awful nervous, honey. I've got to make a speech. Yeah, I know you have. I wanted to say, "give me Liberty, or give me death." But they wouldn't let me. I had to learn a new one. Yeah, that's what they told me. Want me to say it for you? "160 years have passed--" wait a minute, honey. Look, maybe you better not do it now. You know, you might get tired out or your throat might get sore, when you get on the bandstand, you won't do it good. Don't you want me here, Steve? Well, sure, I want you, but, well, there are times when a fella would like to be by himself. I got some thinking to do. Oh, well, if you change your mind, just call me. Yeah, I will if I change my mind. Good-bye. Good-bye. Oh, good-bye. Mr. Parker, would you mind dancing with me? I think you're an awful good dancer. Well, I'd be very happy to, Flavia. Will you excuse me? Oh, go right ahead. I'll be back in a minute. - Steve's nervous. - He's what? Steve's nervous. I think you ought to talk to him. Oh, thank you, darling. It certainly is an awful lot of trouble getting people married. Oh, I'm ready now. Thank you for the dance, Mr. Parker. Why... Come on, let's hide this till morning. Yeah. Hey. A mouse! That Tony's about as funny as a crutch. I'll fix him. Yeah. Thank you, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, maybe because they like my Hibernian face-- The businessmen of this neighborhood who give you this party at not one cent cost to you, asked me to get my suit pressed and my shoes shined, which I did, and come up and introduce the speaker of the evening. A short while ago, a very great man made a very great speech. Some may have missed it, but it's worth repeating. So we're going to ask the most popular young ladies of the neighborhood to come up and recite it for us. It's my pleasure at this time to present to you miss Flavia mills. Mama, I'm scared I'll forget. The words are so big. The thoughts are big, too that's why they're worth saying. I'm not afraid. You won't forget. "160 years have passed since the fourth of July, 1776. "We have subdued a wilderness "that men said could not be conquered. "We have established a civilization where others insisted "a civilization could not survive. "We have built a Republic, a government, "for which, in the extent of its democracy, "there had been no precedent. "Our country, richly endowed in body, mind, and spirit, "still has need of many things, "but I am certain one of its greatest needs today "is the enlistment of the spirit of youth. "Our war for independence was a young man's crusade. "Our constitution likewise was the creation of young minds. "Be wise enough, be tolerant enough, "you who are young in years, "to remember that millions of older people have kept, "and propose to keep, those qualities of youth. "You ought to thank god tonight if, regardless of your years, "you're young enough in spirit to dream dreams and see visions, "dreams and visions about a greater and finer America there is to be, "that poverty can be lessened, "that class hatreds can be done away with, "and that peace at home and peace abroad can be maintained. "And that one day a generation may possess this land "blessed beyond anything we now know, "blessed with those things, material and spiritual, "which makes man's life abundant. "If that is the fashion of your dreaming, then I say, hold fast to your dreams. America needs it." Hello, Flavia. Hello, Ms. Laura. Hello, Flavia. Hello. Jiminy doodlebug, just like my mother said! How much does a taxicab cost, mama? A taxicab? Oh, I guess a secondhand one costs around-- Oh, I mean a new one. A new one? Oh, around $2,000, I guess. Very, very reasonable. What on earth is she going to do with all those cigar boxes? I haven't any idea what Flavia's going to do until it's too late. Oh, mama, can I have that piece of cheese out of the icebox? - It'll spoil your supper. - I'm not going to eat it. I remember the games I played as a child, and not a single one of them had cigar boxes or cheese in them. This isn't a game. I'm going into a new business. I wish somebody told me about this years ago. About what years ago? Well, it's kind of a secret. I haven't told anybody. Well, that's hardly anybody except Jimmy Lewis. I had to tell him. If you didn't tell us, why tell him? He's going to ask his mother if he can go in business. He has plenty mice in his house, and we're going 50/50. Have you any idea what she's talking about? I haven't any idea what I'm talking about. What on earth are you doing? Come in. Hey, there's big excitement down at the corner. - Somebody robbed old Mac. - That's terrible. What happened? Somebody swiped his box with the money. I can't understand why not keep it in a bank. Mac's father once lost over $200 when the bank failed. That was during the Spanish-American war. - Well, I still think-- - Cigar box. Flavia, what was in that cigar box? Money. Let me see it. Ok, mama. Hey, wait a minute. This looks like old Mac's money. He told me about the 4 rubber bands. Oh, but, Steve, it couldn't be. Where did you get this money, Flavia? The mouse gave it. Mouse? What mouse? The one I caught. Your mouse? And it turned into money. - But, Flavia-- - Wait a minute. Come here, sweetheart. Now, look, you tell Steve, where did you get the money? In the box where I kept my mouse. Well, where did you keep it? In the hole in the wall in the alley. Honey, look, there's been some kind of a mix-up. I don't know what happened, but that's Mac's money. But it couldn't be, Steve. I did everything mama told me to. I caught a mouse, and I hid it away. Look, darling, all that talk about the mouse turning into money, you know, that's just make-believe. Like remember when we rode around in the old cab, and the city hall was Buckingham Palace and you were the Princess? But this was a real mouse. Well, Flavia, mice don't turn into money. But mommy, you said that they did-- Mice, I mean. That was just something I said. I didn't want you afraid. But mice do turn into money, don't they? No, Flavia, I'm afraid not. But what you said was true, wasn't it? No, Flavia. Then I guess everything you... Mother, answer me truthfully, yes or no. If it rains before 7:00, it isn't always clear before 11:00? No, darling. And... and cats, they don't always have 9 lives, do they? And when you wish on a star, it doesn't always come true? No, Flavia. Then everything you... Gee, that's too bad. It had to happen sooner or later though. Yeah, I guess that's the trouble with growing up. When did Mac first find out his money was missing? Do you know? Yeah. It was right after the party. Thank goodness you were up on that bandstand. Yeah, it was a lucky break. Even that detective must know you couldn't be in two places. Wait a minute. What do you mean? What? What do you mean, thank goodness I was there. Oh, nothing in particular. I just thought, if you were there, you couldn't have anything to do with Mac's money disappearing. That's what I thought you meant. As soon as anything funny happens here, everybody looks in one place, right at me. Even you. Oh, you're wrong, Steve. Sure, I'm wrong. I'm 100% wrong in this town. Well, thank goodness there's only a little over 5 months to go. I'm going to take a walk. Wait, Steve. What you said was right. You do have to get out of town. Everything is just the way you said. The day after you came back. - Sure. Nothing's changed. - Nothing. I thought I could change you. I figured if I loved you enough, by the time 6 months was up, you'd get over the idea of leaving town. But now I see one thing clearly. You and I... We've got no future together, here or anyplace else. I was only trying to hang on to something, but it wasn't there. If we ever had anything, it's dead, Steve, good and dead. Now go and take your walk. Bags! Bottles! Old clothes! Bags! Bags! Bottles! Old clothes! Bags! Hey, watch where you're going! Paper! What do you read? Get your papers! It's only me, Mac. I didn't hear you. Where's your skate? I didn't feel like skating. You weren't here for the afternoon editions. I was busy. - But--what? - Your money. Flavia, where did you get it? I don't know. You don't know. You mean that you-- You think what everybody else thinks. You think that I stole it! I didn't mean that. I only--Flavia! Flavia! Is madam in a hurry? Could I help madam with her parcels? I can carry them, thank you. There's no extra charge. I'd be glad to carry madam for a small fee, say one of her bright, dazzling smiles. I'm here now, thank you. Oh, come on, honey, snap out of it. Nobody ever really thought that you stole old Mac's money. I bet those kids who stole it won't forget it for a long time, believe me. I don't care who took it. I don't care anything about it, except that my mother told me mice turn into money, and they don't. Oh, I wouldn't go in just yet, now, Flavia. The doctor's with your mama. What's wrong with my mama? Oh, nothing to worry about, dear. Nothing. How is she, doctor? She's just doin too much. - Don't worry, Flavia. - Can I go in now? Yes, go right in, honey. Don't you feel well, mama? Yes, dear. - But you had to have the doctor. - I know. Flavia, come here. You got dark bread. That's good. Your father likes it best. And lettuce. That's a nice head. Sit down, Flavia. Don't look so sober, darling, after all... Do you remember I told you there was something I wanted very much? We're going to have a baby, Flavia, I hope it's going to be a little girl. - Do you know why, dear? - No, mama. Because I love you so much. Papa will be home soon. I'll help get supper ready. All right. That will be a wonderful help. Aren't you glad, darling? Yes, mama. I'm glad. Come in. Al! What are you doing away from the garage at this time? I figured I'd better do this before I lost my nerve. Susan, will you marry me right after the first of the year? Why, Al. And I guess you know Steve's going away very soon. He's going alone. Yes, he told me. Well, he has the right to live his life the way he wants to. Why, you and I-- Susan, I can make you happy. I know I can make you happy. We're not children. We can look at this sanely. I love you. I can't bear to think of you sitting around alone eating your heart out. I promise you, you'll never be sorry. If you mean, is there a chance for me to fall in love with you, I honestly don't know. You mean, maybe... If you-- If you want to marry a girl who knows-- Who thinks she's still stuck on a guy, if you mean that you're willing to-- I'll spend the rest of my life trying. Al, you're very sweet. Well, now, you see? You're getting to like me already. - Hi, Fred. - Hiya, Steve. Have you got those roller skates, the ball-bearing kind for kids? Yes, plenty. - 3 and a quarter? - That's right. Yeah, that's it. That's the ticket. Look, wrap them up nice, put some stickers and ribbon on 'em for a Christmas. All right. Be with you in a minute. Joe... You're not going to hawk your violin? All I know is that Helen's having a baby. And I've got to get money. But how will you give any lessons? - How'll you earn a living? - I've got to get money. Then why don't you borrow it? From who? Well, uh... What's the matter with me? I got a couple of bucks. I owe you too much already. Oh, forget about it. No, no, look, go on down to Auggy's. Maybe that job is open. - I've been there. - I know, but try again. This might be your lucky day. I'll see you at the house. Hey, Dan, get rid of this guy, will you? Oh, Harold, excuse us. Please. Yeah, I was just leaving. Dan, I... I need some dough right away, couple of hundred bucks. Who doesn't? You figured a way to get it? I thought I might borrow it from you. Oh, buddy boy, there's a depression on. Haven't you heard? Ordinarily a couple hundred bucks wouldn't mean any more than a nickel, but right now... I'll tell you what. You go find a guy to lend you 200, get some for me. Of course, there might be other ways. You interested? I said I had to have the dough. You think that you could sneak a truck out of that garage with a big Glenport trucking sign on it? I could at night. At night's when we want it. Tonight's best of all. All the chumps will be out celebrating Christmas Eve. What time do you want it and where? Sit down. Here's the way we'll do it. At 11:00 tonight, you come by and you pick me up. I want you to rest. Don't do a thing. If there's anything very wrong, I want to know. Mrs. Mills, there's nothing really wrong, and there needn't be, but you have to stay absolutely quiet for these next few weeks-- No work, no exertion of any kind, absolute rest. We can't take any chances on losing the baby. I see. Flavia! Have that prescription filled, Flavia, and give your mother one tablet and a glass of water every 4 hours today. Will you remember that? - I'll remember. - Good. I'll drop by again tonight. You see that your mother doesn't do any work. And you, young lady, don't worry. Good-bye. Bye, doctor. The doctor said for you not to do any work. Oh, yes. I'll get Mrs. Murphy to come in. You needn't. I'll be all right, dear. It would be better. I'll hurry. You'll find money in the teapot, Flavia. Yes, I know. Oh! I just knocked my bank off. Did it break? Yes. Let me see it. Oh, look, darling, the little cow isn't really broken. She's just kneeling, getting ready for Christmas. All over the world, cows kneel on Christmas Eve, didn't you know that? They kneel in honor of the child who was born in the manger. They were the first to worship him. How do cows know that it's Christmas? Because then god is very close, and the cows feel his presence as they did on that first night, and they fall on their knees for his blessing. What's a blessing? It's god's love enfolding us, darling. It's his way of answering our prayers. - Mama? - Yes, dear. Did you ever see a cow kneel? Why, I... No, not really, darling. Then it isn't true? Don't you like to think the holy child loves us so much that he comes back on Christmas Eve? Don't you want to believe it, Flavia? Yes, mama. But I can't. I'll go to the drugstore now. All right, dear. Steve. Huh? Oh, it's you. I want to ask you something. Well, what is it? Steve, tell me the truth. I couldn't stand it if you told me something and it turned out to be different. Answer me yes or no. Are you going away? Yes, honey, I am. Hiya, Steve. Hi. Keeping busy? - Yeah, I'm keeping busy. - That's good. What's good about it? Oh, the medicine. I don't like to keep after you. Yeah, I know. You're just doing a job. The next time they arrest you, you'll be gone longer than 18 months. Don't land in prison again. Steve, they don't parole you a second time. Thanks for the tip. Thank you, dear. Flavia. Yes, mama? What's the matter? Nothing, mama. Darling, tell mother what the matter is. Nothing's the matter, mama. Turn around, Flavia. Darling, look at me. Now, tell me what it is, please. Steve didn't go around the world like you all told me. No, he didn't. He was in prison. Yes, he was. You knew it. Aunt Susan knew it. Even Steve... He told me a story, too. Sometimes, darling, for a person's own good, you don't exactly tell all the truth. But you said over a hundred times, the truth is the truth, and anything else is a lie, and there's nothing in between. That's what you said. Yes, but we all thought it was better, knowing how much you love Steve, not to tell you about him. But if this isn't the truth, then it's a lie, isn't it? A white lie. I don't know who to believe. I don't know what to believe. Everybody lies to me, even the ones I love the most. Flavia. Flavia! Flavia! Flavia! Flavia, come back! Flavia! Flavia! Take the baby in the next room. We won't have time to look after it here. Doctor? The way she's breathing. Pull her sleeve up, will you, Susan? Oh, Flavia, go sit down, honey. We're busy. - Is the baby warm? - Well, yes. Is she very bad, doctor? And now we know how. We at least saved the baby, but only a miracle can save the mother. Only the good lord's blessing can save her now. Mama! Mama! Please, Flavia, darling. But, Susan, I want to see my mama. I know, darling, but she's awfully sick. Please, Susan, let me go in. I want to see her. You want to help your mother, don't you? Yes. Then, please go in your room and wait. Susan, will you come in here, please? Mac! Is that you, Flavia? Mac, oh, Mac. - What is it? - My mama's sick. She is? What's the matter? I don't know, Mac. She fell down the stairs. I didn't mean to do it. Honest, I didn't. It was Steve, and, oh, Mac, - I got to find a cow. - A cow? Why a cow? I just got to find one. It was because I didn't believe in her. Where is there I can find a cow? Please tell me. I haven't got much time. Well, you better get someone to take you to the stockyards. Stockyards. Thanks, Mac. - I missed you, Flavia. - I missed you, too. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Paper, paper. What do you read? They're all late. Steve! Flavia, what are you doing out here? Oh, Steve, I'm so glad to see you. Why did you follow me? What's the idea? I don't care what you did. I don't care if you were in jail. You gotta help me. What's the matter, sweetheart? Oh, Steve, please help me find a cow right away. A cow? What do you want a cow for? My mom is awful sick, Steve. Only a miracle can save her. And cows kneel on Christmas Eve at midnight, and, oh, Steve, I've just gotta find one, I've just gotta. - What's that kid doing here? - I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing here. - Get rid of her. - I'll get rid of her. Come on, Flavia. Hey, walk out now, say good-bye to your 200 bucks. Good-bye. Hold up, you! It's a pinch. Get over there. Take 'em down and book 'em. I'll be along in a few minutes. All right, down here, you. Hey! What's the idea? We've got to find a cow by midnight. I can't explain why, partner, but it's awful important. Please. I don't know what it's about, but all right. - There's some in here. - Hey, what's up? They want to see a cow. Open the door. - A cow? - Yeah, open the door. All right. Hurry, hurry. It'll be too late. Honey... Look, sweetheart, remember the time when the mouse was supposed to turn into money and didn't? Well, this is a story just like that, honey, and maybe the cow won't-- Oh, no, Steve, this has gotta be true. Here we are. Oh, Steve, it isn't kneeling. Come on, honey. Let's go home. I can't see, but I know you're close. Please listen to me. I've been a very bad girl. I didn't believe, but now I saw. You made the cow kneel to show me. I know you're close listening. Make my mama live. Only you can. It would be only one more miracle. Please, please, dear god, make my mama live. Oh, Steve, couldn't you feel it, the blessing when the cow kneeled? Yeah. Flavia, dear, we've been looking for you. Susan, I want to see my mama. Yes, dear, go in. Mama! Mama! Oh, mama. Oh, mama, you've got to get well because everything you said was true. We found the cow, and just as it started to turn Christmas, the bell started ringing, and the cow kneeled. It's true, mama, it's really true. Hey, funny face... Is that you crying? I wasn't crying, mama, not really. I thought I heard you. It's true. I asked the blessing to make you well, and it's come true. It is, isn't it? Your coat, it's wet. You'll catch cold. No, I couldn't. I'm too happy inside. Nothing could make me cold now. Helen, I got the job at Auggy's. Take the baby in the other room. Yes, doctor. Open some presents, Flavia? - Can I? - Sure. Go ahead. Oh, gee, this is heavy. Jiminy doodlebugs, skates! That's just what I wanted. Oh! "In appreciation of your speech, tenth Avenue Businessmen's Association." From now on, they get all my business. Merry Christmas, honey. I didn't know those other guys would have the same idea. Another pair of skates. Oh, Steve, but I like yours much better. Mac! Flavia. We found the cow, and mama's all right. Good, good. Merry Christmas, old timer. Merry Christmas, Steve. Merry Christmas, Susan. Merry Christmas, Mac. Gee, Mac, how did you know Susan was here? I told you I was smart. Merry Christmas, Flavia. Skates. Oh, but, Mac, I... Oh, gee, Mac, they're swell. Just what I wanted. I had to give you something. Christmas Carols. Gee, Mac, I've got a present for you. Susan... There's something I want to tell you. You don't have to, Steve. I think I know. I'm not going away, Susan. I'm going to win my fight right here where I lost it. Can I help? Well, what about Al? I thought that you and he-- You think too much, Steve. You never did know all the answers. ♪ ...Let us adore him ♪ ♪ Oh, come let us adore him ♪ You know, Mac, among the Eskimos, kissing is practically unknown. No Eskimos around here!
