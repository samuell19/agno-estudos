And that's exactly what I said, Do you understand that you are feeling different? Okay ... I agree ......... We will solve it by talking. To prevent this from happening again, come on ... Why don't you understand I can't come now. I have a job now. the same thing over and over again How many more times will I tell you ... I have a lot of work to do ... Is the work so important? Deepak is there to take care of you, isn't he? I just told you that, We will go home together. Can't hear? Nithya ... Decide now ... I can't wait for you anymore. If you go in now ...... then our relationship ends here. Do you want him or me? You decide, ... Where do I go from you? Have you exceeded your limits? Simply put ...

I think school life is over there It is better not to talk about what happened. - Aren't we both adults now? - Hmm, that's right ... We are both adults. About any of our past No need to talk anymore. Well, how is Deepak? Deepak is fine ... the car is unstable, Nithya. Within half the time of the college bus I'll get home. But you can't come every day.

What does this 9 o'clock reporting mean? Let's go All right, I'll drop you off at 9 o'clock. How can I tell you, Nithya? Although or say; So what do I say to you? Shall I tell you, I'm not worthy of you. What shall I say; My duties and hardships I can't share with you. I'm so sorry, Nithya. I was trapped ... An emergency ... It doesn't matter ... Nithya, I want to tell you something. This November, I'm going to take the CAT exam. In the meantime, I’ve been admitted to coaching. And I decided that what I really needed to do was learn how to do it right. Other friends in my batch a month ago Started. I'm late. That's why I'm late Which means it's about to be the most delusional time of the year, as well. Oops! This matter? You too You scared me. I thought you were something serious Want to discuss. This is a serious matter, Nithya. hey, I didn't mean that. You understand, don't you? But when did you make that decision? You want to do MBA, in this regard You've never said anything before, If you tell me, maybe I'm with you I would have been admitted in MBA class. No, Nithya. Until you need it. You'll be there, won't you? Let's go ... All is well ... Aren't your parents thinking? Sad but true, no such thing Suddenly the news did not come to me. If my parents think, then Will think about my marriage. Fortunately, I'm looking into the matter. Isn't that so, Varun? You haven't gotten married yet. And, before you ... Vidya must be married, not so. We met many days later, and You say it will be gone in an hour. You came to eat, didn't you? I thought you loved the place. It's too late today, if you don't want to come tell me ... It's so hard to get this ticket there was no need. This is the first time in a whole month I came to see the movie. Only for you ... For me ?? !!!! there is no need for me to suffer so much. Varun ... You are the same as before Don't talk to me ... I am alone with the car I am wandering around like crazy. You call ... text ... See you ... I'm waiting for that. Do not rely on him. she could be your boyfriend ... she may be the man you love ... But she is yours Nothing more than life. Happy birthday :) Thanks ... Looks so beautiful ... as always ... I really miss you so much ... - You look so tired ... - Nothing like that ... Actually ...... That's what I'm going to say You may get upset. But I have to leave in an hour. You know my CAT exam the day after tomorrow. Please, don't be angry ... You passed the CAT exam. I'm really happy ... Everything will be normal from tomorrow, right? I wish we were as happy as before ... there was a time when I used to do whatever I wanted You like that You don't like what I do now. I can't live like you, Nithya ... Someone seems very happy today! Looks like no to me You have called for good news. All my obstacles are gone, Nithya. I finally got a seat at IIM. (IIM: Indian Institute of Management) (Every year 20 autonomous educational institutions under this organization collect their 1550 students through much more competitive CAT exams. Last year more than 2 lakh candidates took part in this exam.) I have passed all the rounds. I did it, Nithya. Kozhikode - Kerala ... I'm coming ... Kerala !!!!! Hmmm ... Kerala. In the next three months ... I know, it didn't happen in the top row colleges, But still it is called IIM. You know, I'm at the coaching center I was admitted too late. hey, we both knew that would happen, wouldn't we? Honestly, I am In fact, I did not think about it. What do you mean? You think I will not be selected, right? hey, that's not it, I knew you would be selected. But, you will go so far I never thought of that. Varun, I'm with you. I want you to do whatever you want in life. Varun, I can come with you. Isn't it? Kerala ... Why didn't it come to my head for so long? I have no job there or I can come up with a course. I can easily convince my father. Besides, Vidya is also letting Apu study outside. You're happy, aren't you? So, what do you want, every night you Take me to my hostel, like Lytton's flat. Will you stay in the hostel? Because that's all I can do. Please Varun ... We will rent an apartment. I'll rent two. All right? No, not at all, Nithya. Why do you hire me ... Will you pay my rent ????? And, that's just the thing here Not within my means (budget). the problem is not there, Nithya. I am going to study there. Everyone has to be on campus. No one can stay out. Don't you want me to go Alas God ... !!! So, you don't want me either? I want you, Nithya. But for no ajaira purpose I don't want you to go there. If you also want to apply, And to pass, but I would be very happy. It's too late ......... when I wanted to apply, then you agreed. Because that was not your goal. You wanted to be admitted for me. Because I want you !! here, what is my crime? Crime? !!! I am not qualified to take such a big responsibility, Nithya. If you make every decision in your life is mine Take it to heart then one day you will hate me. I can't let that happen. I always tell you to do something. That will keep you busy and happy .... Did you want it for me Or did you want it for yourself? when I'm busy with my life, Behind the fact that you are changing like this I will try to reduce the fault of my neck, right? I haven't changed, Nithya. I just opened my eyes. I have learned to understand my responsibility. Poles under your feet I was shocked to see the stage. - Where's my mistake? - Where's the mistake ??? You opened your eyes, Varun. But you left me in the same place as before. I am doing all this for my family. You know how important it is for me. I want to do it for them (family). You are very lucky, Nithya! You can follow your dreams. What else do you want? I have a lot of pressure, a lot of responsibility. Please ......... Oops ... stop ... You're talking like I'm a bad student, Even if you dip it in water, you will not be able to swallow it. You insulted me ... I know who I am. Thank you very much. I was always first in class, Did you forget In every debate competition I would be the first. Did you forget that My life was so happy! From the word "my" when "our" the word came, everything changed !!! when you were busy, I was alone then. And to accept the sacrifice for you ... I am my family, relatives I have moved away from everyone. Just for you ... Do you know a thing I hear the word "no" in my mouth My friends stopped calling me. the two of us to maintain the relationship One of them has to accept the sacrifice ... So I accepted the sacrifice. - I never told you anything because ... - then why are you telling me now? Why? I didn't tell you to do that ... I always told you to go out And do something yourself. Honestly, like Jenny, your friend, So is my friend .... Not being able to give friends time Blame it on me? I'm not blaming you, Varun. I was showing you the reason. I just wanted to say ... "I have no one but you." Don't let me come with you! Not possible. the pain you are experiencing today is one day You will be the cause of your arrogance towards me. For your good, for my good, For our good ... You don't have to come. Please ... hey, I can't explain this to you Azaira Panchal looks like poison to me. That's why I took the MBA course Don't make me feel guilty. Please, it really hurts. You make my life decisions, It hurts me ... Nithya ... Nithya ... For your own good For our good You have to make another decision. Leave me alone ... now ... Because, I can't stand it anymore! [After three years] "It's not right to look for love." ... "Because, even if you get love You can't keep that for long. " "It simply came to our notice then. Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation. " "And of course this rainbow You have to stay for the rest of your life. " This is the real love. It happened to me. hello ... Do you understand that you are upstairs? hey, I'm crazy, Jenny ...

I took him in six months I have to run away somewhere. His father can't even look me in the eye. His brother doesn't like me either. We even got into a fight once. Besides, she is "Ershad", I can't understand him !! On top of that, she's my one year old again! Another bonus is, His wedding is set to take place in a church next month. Oh brother, there are so many girls in the world Why did I fall in love with Jenny? Where did I hear this dialogue? That weight ...

I'm not leaving without talking. - Release ... - What the sheck ... Let's go ... Oi ... oi ... oi ... this way ... Kiri boy, she told me to go to shell. Much like that. Shameless self-promotion for Ballistic Products and a great bargain on a neat little knife for you. I can't go without talking. I don't like the thing, Ray. You, like him, would say, "Go away and die, the smell is running." If I say, "Go away and die." I would go home then ... My own or ... without tears there was no more work. Oops ... You met in college 3 years later ... After seeing each other, you cling like a feminist I started talking and then I fell in love again. I thought something like that would happen this time. Honestly, this girl is the nation It is very difficult to understand. Well, how long have you been saying? Wait here? 10 days? I'll wait 20 days ... Do I have to wait? It's a matter of my life. Can't wait? the thing is ... Listen, a hero is like "Tolly Prema" Requested to hear Cute Love Story. I have to go tell him the story. Who is the hero? R. Narayan idol. (R. Narayan Murthy is an actor from India, Director, composer, singer, and producer) Nithya, left everything and came here. *** That one girl is my friend *** Jenny told me about him last night. Nithya has been here for the last 6 months. she came here exactly 2 months after the tsunami. Since then she has been set here. During this time, she only went home once. she's been here a year ... Only after the school is set up properly she decided to go home. Oh, I think to convince him It will take another year. . Until then, you have to wait here. I will come and see you from time to time. Jenny, you can stay here. In fact, only a few rooms are empty. I am the teacher of this place Just as the stay quarters. I have the key. Income I give you. Come on ... come on ... Looks like a ghost bungalow dude. This bungalow, for these two ghosts It's a perfect fit. All right, let's go inside. Come on guys ... Lights? Oh ok No matter .... the place is not bad. It will not be so easy to convince him. Until then, you better stay here. Otherwise, I said I would read Azaira experience. What happened, Varun? Is everything alright? All right. What is his condition? she is fine. Just all the time Sitting in front of the computer. Yes, that's right. - Another 5 minutes ... - Okay. All these mails I wrote 3 years ago, Nithya. But today I have the courage to send you. Read these. "I love you" I sent these articles earlier there seemed to be no gain. Because, I knew you wouldn't read that. That's why I didn't send you these emails. But I sent it today, because ... One day or another you will surely read it. (Barun Message Ditch) - I'll be with you that day. A nice little room ... A window next to it. the mind wants through the window I drag you .... (Speaking of hostel life) Forbids you to come I acted like a fool, Nithya. I'm an ass! An insanity! Tomorrow is our first day of college. I'm not feeling well. It would be nice to have you here. It would have been great. Honestly ... You are supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to stay. You are angry with me now. That's why What, I did not reply to any of my mails. I understand, You forgot me, didn't you? It seems that I no longer exist in life. Just respond once, Nithya. I'll be leaving ... Why don't you stay away ... You love me so much You did a lot for me ... Embrace me with love and absolute affection It is impossible to measure the value of time. here I am everyone's "profit guru". I named my kitcshen "Lover". All my friends know about you. Are you smiling? Smile ... I might be without you I can survive, Nithya. But there will be a lot of trouble .... Can i tell you something Let's just say ... You are more beautiful than I can imagine. Punish me, still Excuse me. - Good morning ... - Good morning ... hey ... don't go ... come on ... Why are you standing here? Have you read my emails? I read 483 emails. I couldn't sleep at night. I couldn't even sleep in the morning. Sorry ... for disturbing your sleep. And, thanks. To read e-mails. then ... Nothing ... I mean ... After reading the e-mails ... What should I say? "I understand you" Want to hear that? I know you very well, Varun. there is nothing to say here. If you send me these (e-mails) then ... I would assume, these are straightforward It came from your mind. I said these things from the heart, Nithya. I just thought, I am reading a beautiful book. the day I left you ... Every second from that day till today You were in my mind, Nithya. Only you ... Do you think I read your emails? Shall I come to you and apologize? I know ... You're not the kind of person to leave so soon ... But it would have been better to leave. I will wait for the revelation here ... hey, why should I wait?

Every day spent there, every watch, You were the only one in every feeling. - What else can I do? - I don't know. Is my guilt so big? For my family, for study, one Took a little time for the job. Is that it? Is it wrong? Everything is over, isn't it? Oh ... so, when you open the wish box This time my name has come. Isn't it? You come here and call me, And will I be ready?

Don't talk about the past anymore, Nithya. Talk to you soon ... I'm arguing with you here I didn't come to do it, Nithya. You know why I came here. For you Let's go to Hyderabad and talk. I will not go to Hyderabad. I have a lot of work to do here. You're suddenly here, I'm everything I can't leave you anymore. Don't go for me ... This is my life now. That's all I have, Varun. I think you understand. Even if you stay here for another 6 months there will be no work, right? Honestly, you're not too busy. You want revenge, don't you? You thought you ate me No more work, right? Actually, your words are mine Not once did I remember. Honestly, you were not in my thoughts. Look at these kids, they are my everything now. Many years ago ... I thought you were my world. Don't worry now ... If you admit, One day I was your world But today these kids are all yours. So, you are doing something in life. This is what I said that day. But You made me a much bigger villain. Well, you studied psychology, didn't you? Think logically ... I didn't bring you to Kerala, That's why you broke up. Because of your stubbornness If i were you Would this world of yours have developed then? Nothing would have happened ..... Like Akaimma, back to my home To wait all the time. I used to sit like Akaimma? That's right. Is all this possible because of you? You changed my life? I name our school building I'll put it in your name, Varun. Thanks ... Nithya ... Didn't write in the e-mail ... "We're here to stay together" - isn't it? This is our true nature. You don't want to talk about the past, do you? But I can't forget the past. "We didn't come to be together." This is what is written on our foreheads. What are you talking about Baal? You don't want to be alone, we live together. I say it again, every time We are separated because of you. We broke up because of you. If there is any problem, you run away. Even this time you say, We cannot be one. We cannot be one. Without shouting, without quarreling, without arguing ... We can't say a word, can we? That's why I said ... All your ajaira words It is not possible for me to be the master. You have to settle everything You've come this far, haven't you? And now you say, all my fault? If you put all the blame on my neck? Just 15 minutes ... If you can't keep your head down and talk. How do i trust you - How can I believe? - No need to come ... Is there no brain in the head? I don't even need to believe. And there is no need to come. One minute! - hello - Hi ... I'm talking ... I have come to Hyderabad. Want to talk to you Listen ... Can we meet somewhere? hello ... I came to see a friend, I'll call you later ... bye ... Before leaving Manapada, Didn't you tell me once? ... Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first. Vidya's marriage is fine. - I'm here to invite you. - when? the wedding is tomorrow. I came yesterday. Sorry for the last minute invitation. I wanted to meet you and invite you. Will you come? Good thing you called. In fact, I had something to say to you. My marriage is fine, Nithya. My sister-in-law's younger sister. they have been saying this for a long time. the marriage was fixed this month. I also agreed. the wedding will take place next month. Now ... I will do a small ceremony. I have a job. In London ... It is a brokerage firm. Company name Seymour Pierce. her name is Radhika. Congregation, Varun. That's good news. Will you come tomorrow Married but tomorrow morning. You come to the reception. she's going too far from me ... she has found another one. she's leaving without me. she has agreed to marry someone else, therefore, I no longer exist in his life. I am no longer in his life. I made a mistake, sister. I made a big mistake. I know ... I never thought she would do that. I never thought this would happen. Nithya ... Please, don't cry ... I did not speak to him that day. she came to my classroom. And she was standing there looking at me. As soon as I look at the children, she is no she left without speaking. she's gone! If she hugged me and said, "I will never leave you." I wouldn't let him go then. here are some excerpts from the original movie. That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. In this cut off part ... Nithya comes to Varun's wedding. Jenny wasn't happy about it at all. Because she knows Nithya is suffering. Nithya said, Varun is his good friend, so she has come. However, it is not possible for anyone to congratulate the marriage of the person closest to you from there. For that, Nithya also came out of the wedding ceremony. And sits alone in the car. Nithya, I'm Varun. Varun ...... I want to talk to you. I thought I would call. But I don't understand, Is it okay to call now? I thought I would call but You called. Really? What do you think, Nithya? Why are you today What do you want Sorry, I don't know what I'm doing. when it's time to leave, leave. No problem. I have to get out of the house at 5 o'clock. Mom will wake up at 4:30. Will get married in the temple. That's why I have to go early in the morning. Why are you here, Nithya? I came to wish you. (Wish: Greetings) And I'm sorry to hear that. I don't want you to hate me This is more important to me. It's not possible, Nithya. I hate you, Nithya. Me ... my love ... You never understand You are not worthy of my love. In this part of the roof ... To take me with you I fell at your feet. I felt the same way that day. You don't understand me ... You don't understand my love. You are not worthy of my love. I also went to Manapad, Nithya. Varun ......... And there is no need to do that. We have already done a lot. And no, please. We're both fine now. We should be like friends. Don't hate ... okay? All right. I'm going ... Do you understand that you are going to Manapada tomorrow? How do you know We have two postmen. Our common friends. (Jenny and Prakash) they don't tell me anything about you. I know that ... Is it a new car? Not mine ... it's my father's ... Wow, Varun .... Really very beautiful .... I'm really happy. Don't drive? You don't take things the other way. I'm not saying to insult you. I mean, when you bring a car, then I would drive. So ... Now it's your turn ... What happened? Nothing. Does Radhika know about me ?! Hmmm, you know. Say nothing about you It is impossible for me to explain myself. I was the first to take the class because of you. Getting last grade in HSC You passed, because of me. You eat shrimp the habit happened because of me Again because of me You stopped eating. Does she know it? You eat 40 shrimps, hold your stomach, when you were crying like a baby ... I didn't feel bad then. Got a lot of fun! Were you scared to see 40 shrimps? I learned a lot more from you. Never a girl on the day of closure It is not right to go to the restaurant to eat. when you go to the movies, Must be present at the right time. On birthdays, from morning to evening, Girlfriend has to give time. That ... I have learned all this from you. You have to be thankful for that. You must have learned a lot! I learned two things. One is definitely "cricket". What is leg spin? What is off-spin? Out swing ... in-swing ... Who is "Adam Gilchrist"? And that Australian wicket-keeper, I know that ... I know you girls, this foreigner Get to know the players very well. All right, who said "Ramesh Power"? You see ... you got caught! then ... You will marry Orange, I never really thought of that. I have known him for a long time, Nithya. As brother-in-law. she used to come to our house from time to time. And she is a very good girl. I actually came to this event to see him. I came to see, who are you marrying? What is your plan? when are you getting married Didn't think about marriage. What are you talking about, Nithya. You always talk about marriage. I didn't talk about my marriage, Varun. I used to talk about marrying you. "I'm sorry", Nithya. What situation are you going through, Why didn't you tell me once, Varun? Your home, father, mother, younger brother ... Why didn't you tell me about this? You know, boys Most of the time they are stupid. Ego stays high! That's right ... This place hasn't changed a bit. the swing is in the same place as before. It is a middle class colony, Nithya. Nothing will change. It was also my colony. Forgot? Once upon a time ... You're right, Nithya. In case of any problem, immediately "I don't want that," she said. "Leave me alone" You didn't say that right that day But, you treat me like this You didn't make the issue right. Even, I told you to leave, so What do you mean, you're leaving me? Just three hours before your wedding I told you this, remember. You're my best friend, Varun. You know me better than I do. Likewise, I know you well. I wanted to tell you that too. Did you come here to say that? To say all this? Don't say anything else? Dad ... You didn't sleep? Varun ... You're so late, with that girl Went to meet, right? How were you when you did MBA at IIM ... How was it when I was studying engineering ... I have seen both. Something happened to you, I know. Either way, despite the fear of losing your job, You do not have the permission required to post. I found out by talking to Prakash .. Or she is running a school in Manapada. I have heard about Nithya from Appu once or twice. Once you call your mother "Amma" Instead of calling, I called her Nithya. Yes, Dad. I went in search of him. I want to meet him Went and showed. I said good bye. Can I say good bye? What are you going to do now? You don't understand, do you? What will happen to Radhika ... the matter is really a matter of tension. Radhika is like our daughter. It would not be right to hurt him. You love someone I will suffer for him ... And I will marry Radhika. That's not right either. You can't keep him happy either. This is very unjust. I don't think she forgot you either. If that's the problem ... You must know what to do then. Varun ... Why are you here Ask your sister, Why am I here ... Close the door, Kavia. Tell them ... Tell them ... I never remembered your words. hey ... I didn't say that. Your sister says. How can i trust you Did you find me stupid, whenever I call? We can never be together ... I didn't say but ... Said your sister. Manapade did not say this? That's when I left. You don't believe me And I had no hope. I came here and agreed to get married. Why are you now, Nithya? I mean we never love each other I can't hate, can I? Varun, Dad is at home. All this stay now. Talk to you later. Why should I care about your parents? she never thought about my parents. What does it matter to me if she hates me? I hate you What happened? I'm sorry, Varun. I should say sorry. Do you know who should say? To Radhika, to her parents, to my fiance, Who is Harish Bhaiya, my family .... the marriage broke up on the day of the wedding ... Shoes on the feet of those who hear it Open and beat me with socks. they should say sorry. Sorry ... Are you sorry now? I do not believe. I do not believe. I thought this was your life I will never see the face again, Nithya. But tomorrow is when you actually are I want to get closer to you. That's why ... that's why ... I hate you. Don't cry, Nithya. Don't cry It is very easy for girls to cry. This is not to say that we should cry over everything. Vidya Apu, what happened? What am I doing here? I'm going ... Who are you I came to see your daughter. Not number three. Number two. Nithya. Nithya! ... she knows nothing. I came. Nithya! ... I just came here. Varun ... Varun Krishna. - Vidya, what's going on here? - Dad, nothing happened. I'll tell you later. -Listen ... - I've been here many more times. I know him very well. From school life ... when we were eight. Alaknanda Apartments ... After getting up at Inter, 20 minutes before college A separate car could be reacshed to reach. she would go for me. Aunty, you used to send that extra lunch box, That was for me too. she has a mobile in college Was lost. Remember? That mobile is still with me. the first of my life ... Five Star Lange .........
