Even serial killers live next door to somebody. Tough pill to swallow, I know, but it's true. If I've learned anything, it's that people hardly ever let you know who they really are. Just past the manicured lawns and friendly waves, inside any house, even the one next door, anything could be happening and you'd never know. And that's the thing about this place. It all might seem normal and routine, but the truth is the suburbs are where the craziest shit happens. You never know what might be coming around the corner. Davey. Hey bud, what's going on? Oh, hey Mr. Mackey. Hey. Oh, thank you. What's with all the dirt? I've been doing a little planting in the garden. Um, there was no cash in your mailbox yesterday for the paper. Has it been a month already? Yeah. Jeez. Uh, ok. Well, actually I was going to ask if you could help me lift something inside if you have a second. I'll get the money then. Two birds, one stone? Ok, sure. Great. After you. I knew I had it. There you go. Thank you. You got a big family, huh? Yeah, I guess so. Just uh, you know, make sure you don't live too close to them or they'll come knocking on your door every day. Alright, this is it. Some new furniture for upstairs, so I gotta get this hunk of junk downstairs. Think we can manage it? Uh, yeah. Sure. Alright? Here we go. Ok. It is heavy. Yeah. Watch your step. Here, let me try that way. There we go. Woah! Jesus. - You ok? - Uh, yeah. Yeah, shit. Sorry. That's ok. As long as it didn't get your foot or anything. You alright? Yeah. Why don't we just take a break? Ok. Sorry about that. Damn water heater just keeps getting louder and louder. Gotta get a new one. Flip side of not living near any family is never anyone around to lend a hand. Hey, I uh, I really appreciate you helping me out. Uh, what's in there? Well, that is where we're headed. Think you can make it the rest of the way? Yeah. Alright. Heavy son of a bitch, huh? Yeah. I am putting the finishing touches on my dark room. So I'm an amateur photographer. I figured that this piece could store some equipment. Yeah, it's cool. Um, I'm sort of an amateur videographer, so I get it. Just like the old man. My god, I remember when your parents would push you around the block in the stroller. Now look at you. How old are you, anyway? 15. 15. That's the perfect age. I wish I could just freeze it for you. Uh, well, I gotta go. Yeah. Of course. Go ahead. Thank you for this. I will, uh, take it from here. - Give your family my best? - I will. Manhunt! I am going to get you shitheads! I'm going to find you. Farraday? Find your own spot. You're gonna get us both caught. This is my spot. Not anymore. Now go! Fine. Go. Jesus. Gotcha, dudes! Christ, guys! Hiding in Farraday's spot, man? Lame. You're better than that. Treehouse in 15, after we catch this bitch? He's close. I can practically smell the Noxell on him. Vaginas are magical. I can't wait to get laid. Aren't you guys tired of looking at those same chicks? Shit no, man. Or even just feel up a chick. Second base? That's it? I rounded third once. She was hot, too. Oh, it just so happens to be a chick none of us know. It was on vacation, dipshit. I'd just be happy to get on any base with Nikki. In your dreams, Davey. Yeah, wet dreams. 'How is she so frikken' hot? Too bad she's into my brother. Kyle? No way. He's like twenty and he works at a hardware store. You think Kyle's a dick? My asshole father wants to tear this thing down. What? Ser-seriously? No, man. Can't he at least wait until we go to college? Eats, I need this place. Shit, I would live up here if I could. I mean, I don't know how safe that would be. With the... What? Kids going missing. Ok, here we go. What? Come on. I mean, we all know what you're gonna say. It's a conspiracy. It's all connected. The missing kids aren't random, they're part of some vast governmental alien cover-up, right? So you don't think it's weird? Look, last summer a kid goes missing in Hazelton. Now another kid disappears in Freeport? Uh, Davey, I love you man but uh, you do kinda sound like a schizoid. Remember when he connected a Lite-Brite to his keyboard to try and communicate with the extraterrestrials? Yeah. Or when he swore there was a demonic presence in his room because our houses were built on Indian burial grounds? That was, like, three years ago. And our houses were built on Indian burial grounds. Davey, there's literally no proof of that. - Yes, there is. - No, there's not. Are we done here? I gotta beat off before my parents get home and W.W. III breaks out. Good call. I'm gonna go make a withdrawal from the spank bank. You guys are animals. Yes you are. Woah. Wait, I thought you were sick of looking at the same chicks. I am. Why do you think I stopped banging your mom? - You are so dead. - Oh yeah? - Oh yeah? - Oh yeah Give me the magazine. I'm pretty sure this is non-lethal. This is my magazine! You should not read this stuff before bedtime. Mom, I'm fifteen. Mmmhmm. You don't have to tuck me in anymore. Maybe you don't need me to, doesn't mean I'm ready to give it up. You think dad's coming home soon? I don't know, hon. You know how the news is. Always something going on that needs reporting. Ok, sleep tight. Hey guys, Ipswich Lanes tomorrow? Scope some cuties? I'm in. I hope that chick from last week is there. She was all over me. You asked to touch her boobs and she threw you over the railing. Bet I don't look half as dumb as Davey every time he sees Nikki in the DJ booth and jizzes in his pants. Oh yeah? Well, I can see her right now. Naked. Bullshit. Dude, if you're serious, I hate you. Oh my god, she's waving for me to come over. Ok, now I know you're full of shit. Eats out. I'd easily trade both my nuts to have the view. Ok, genius. If you've got no balls what's the point of the view? You'd just be some ball-less perv. Can you at least make mom double-bag her meatloaf next time? It smells like werewolf crap. Well, if you would have remembered to put the cinder blocks back on the garbage cans like I told you we wouldn't have this mess. I hate raccoons. You should do an exclusive, get pest control in here. I could film it. Camcorder's off limits, pal. Station property, you know that. How am I supposed to become the next Spielberg if I don't practice? Nice try. Just uh, make sure the driveway's clean before you go anywhere. Capisce, Spielberg? Whatever. ♪ Hot summer streets, ♪ And the pavements are burning, ♪ ♪ I sit around, ♪ ♪ Trying to smile but, ♪ ♪ The air is so heavy and dry, ♪ ♪ ♪ Strange voices are saying, ♪ ♪ What did they say ♪ Things I can't understand, ♪ ♪ It's too close for comfort, ♪ ♪ This heat has got right out of hand, ♪ Guys. Guys. Dude, what? Those are the Pacific Grove Babes from last week. Get off of me, you psycho! I can't. I got needs, Woody. Nikki fucking Kazsuba. She's, like, scientifically the perfect woman. If she was my babysitter I'd have been banging her the day my balls dropped. Yeah, was it hard not to get a boner when she was giving you a bath? Jesus, guys. It was, like, four years ago. Not ten. We just played games and shit. What kinda games? Naughty games? I hate you guys so much. It is now confirmed that 14 Eastern Bloc countries, including the Soviet Union, will boycott the Olympic games in Los Angeles later this summer. Only Romania and Yugoslavia will remain in attendance. Unbelievable. The Cold War's never gonna end. Your future is dim, Davey. Ok. John dropped these off for you today. It must be the fliers for the Bay Festival. Mmmhmm. Oh. Come on. They got some crummy synth band playing this year. Nikki's not DJ-ing like last year? She's amazing. Well, with her parents getting divorced it wasn't really in the cards, pal. Nikki's parents are getting divorced? Where did you hear that? Bob Burnqvist. He bowls with Mike Kaszuba. Apparently it's pretty ugly, supposedly Mike's not even staying at home right now. Let's not gossip, Randall. But that is awful. I never would have thought they were having problems. That's why they invented curtains, hon. Hey, Randall, it's Jimmy. Listen, uh, this is going to sound crazy. The Chronicle received a letter from some guy calling himself the Cape May Slayer. This guy claims he's killed at least 13 teenaged boys over the last decade. Oh my god! Are you sure this isn't a hoax? No, it's... it's legit, man. The story's gonna break any second. We need you in here pronto. I'm on my way. Guys, something big is going down. Someone's going down on who? No, I was right. You know those missing boys? It's a serial killer. My dad just got called in. Holy shit! You're not kidding. It's on the news right now. This afternoon the Cape May Chronicle received a letter from an individual calling themselves the Cape May Slayer, claiming responsibility for the deaths of at least 13 teenaged boys along with two adults. The author also provided a list of names, dates, and pertinent details related to a number of open missing persons cases. We have confirmed the accuracy of these statements. I can now officially label this person as an active serial killer. The sheriff's office reports they're likely looking for a white male in his late 30's to 40's living alone. Preferred targets appear to be males aged 12 to 16- I can't believe something like this Could actually happen here. It could be anyone. This is the coolest thing that's ever happened to us. Didn't they say he hunts guys our age? Should we cool it with the late night manhunt? Why? None of the missing kids are from Ipswich and Cape May 'is pretty frikken' big. It's not that big. What is it, nine towns? It's ten towns. Guys, how are you not freaking out that something's finally happening here? Because there's no way it's gonna hit us. Or this neighbourhood. Dude, look at this place. You're desperate for crazy shit to happen. There's a serial killer on the loose. What else could possibly be this exciting? Incoming titties, 12:00! Holy shit! - Move over, Woody! - I'm next. Dude. If I was over there right now she'd be pregnant. Show her a little respect, ok? Her parents are getting divorced. Statistically, that means she's, like, ‭78 percent more likely to engage in pre-marital sex. You guys are disgusting. Whatever, dude. You were thinking it. Bank it and spank it, boys. Please turn around, please. Shit! Get down! Dude! Fuck! Oh, I'm so fucked. Oh, Davey... you're... you're a really bad kisser. What? I'm-I'm sorry, Nikki, I-what? Guys! Cut the shit! Unlike you idiots I actually come here to study. So don't get me kicked out! Check it out. Cape May Slayer. Fifteen confirmed victims and still counting. So rad. I don't get it. Why would the killer only write a letter now, after all this time? He's been killing people and getting away with it for years. He's bored so he's raising the stakes. He wasn't counting on us. Jesus, Farraday, it's not like you're gonna break it! Peek-a-boobs! Get it? What the hell are you doing? Free porn, bro. Is he just gonna take that? Yo, where the hell's Sammy? We need him or we don't have numbers. I dunno. We haven't heard from him in a few days. 'The Hoffmans' car's in the driveway. They must be home. Let's go get the little shit. Woody, stay with these dickweeds. This way, dickweeds. No movement. Or lights. Oh well. Oh well? No one's seen Sammy in days. - What if- - Don't even say it. He's probably up at the lake or some shit. Why is their car here? Maybe they rented one? - Why would they- - Who cares? Ok, the real issue is that we don't have numbers 'cause of the little prick so now I can't play manhunt. Whatever, I'm out. Yeah, sorry Davey, I got a book to finish anyway. Congrats. You're getting your calcium. So what? Mackey is the Cape May Slayer. Uh... I knew we shouldn't have taken you to the library, Davey. I blame myself. I also blame Farraday. No man, look. Who's the missing ginger? That's the kid I saw in Mackey's dining room a few weeks ago. When we were playing manhunt. - Redheads all look the same. - So true. Well, if you're so sure it's him why don't you uh... just tell your parents? Because they'd never believe me. Guys, I was only, like, ten feet away. I saw him clear as day. That's him. Plus, what about the Hoffmans? Their lake house is only a couple hours north, but their car's still here? And they're neighbours. So? What if one Hoffman saw Mackey with Dusty? Who? The missing ginger. Mackey found out somehow and killed them to get rid of the threat. Eats, tell them what Kyle said. Farraday, what the fuck? What did Kyle say? Goddammit. Fine. Um... he said that Mackey goes to the hardware store every week and buys, like, 100 pounds of dirt, says it's for his garden. Bullshit! Who uses 100 pounds of dirt a week in a backyard garden? You know, he's also got a room in his basement with a padlock on the door. Why would he need that? Still not convinced? 'Suspect is likely a white male, ' 'late 30's to 40's, lives alone.' Who does that remind you of? Dude, Mackey's a cop with a sick reputation. That's why it's so genius. He knows police tactics. He can plant evidence to throw them off, or destroy it if they ever find anything bad. And who would suspect a cop? It's the perfect cover. Guys, if Mackey is what I think he is then we gotta do something. Ok, Magnum P.I. What's your plan? Well, we have to find out the truth... and be able to prove it. We need real, hard evidence. Which means... Stake-out? Search and destroy. Who's with me? This is bat shit crazy. I'm in. Operation Mack Attack starts now. He leaves his house every weekday at 8:24 with a gym bag. Contents unknown. He gets home from work at 6:25 with that same bag. Goes in through the garage and closes it behind him. He always closes it. His weekends are all over the place. No patter. Except that he gardens. A lot. Acidity in the soil must be off, though, plants look like shit. He has dinner alone every night at 8:30-ish, then probably wanks it and cries himself to sleep. Loser. Well, no, because most nights he goes for a jog at 11:00 for about an hour. Not sure where he goes but we should definitely find out. Now that we know his schedule, what do we do next? We catch this fucker and become heroes. Farraday, you're retarded. You think a bunch of glorified Care Bears in hoods could take down the empire? They are aliens and they're highly intelligent! I mean, did you see how fast that one learned to drive a speeder bike, and then ditch it without even being spotted? Whatever, dude. They're bears. Now, if it was Gremlins, I'd buy it maybe. I've still gotta see Gremlins. Hey, maybe you should take Nikki. She can find out what happens if she gets your Mogwai wet. Farraday, stick to shit that could actually happen. Like me fathering a sibling for Woody. Dude, I told you to stop talking about my mom. Would you rather I acted it out? No, I'd rather you just not talk about anything- Shit, Mackey's back! Let's break into his garage. No. We can't do that. He's a cop. Hey guys. Look, at 11:00 he's gonna go for a run. Trust me, I've got a plan. Guys. What the hell are we doing? His fucking trash? Are you kidding me? What? Look, there could be evidence in here. Fingers or bloody rags or something. If we find anything, we got him. Do you know me at all? I am not digging through trash. Yeah, we're gonna get in a lot of trouble if we dig through this on the street. Look, I've had to clean up my driveway three times in the last two weeks because of raccoons. That's all anyone's gonna think. If I find a used condom in there, I'm gonna be so jealous. You guys are crazy. Quit crying, Farraday. Oh my god. You know you can get AIDS from looking through trash, right? The only way you're ever getting AIDS. I can't believe it. Nothing. Maybe he doesn't do the killings here. He could have, uh, like a lair or something. Somewhere. A lair? He's Cobra Commander now? You know, we could always look through his mail. For instance... Ask and you shall receive. Farraday's right. We can check his mail every day and he'll never suspect a thing. See what bills he's getting, people sending him stuff. I'll take care of that responsibility. Guys, look. It's after midnight. We should get out of here before Mackey gets back. Try again tomorrow? Night one, no luck. Says you. Hey, Davey. Um, do you think maybe I can sleep over tonight? I kinda don't wanna be at home. Yeah, sure. We'll make popcorn, watch Close Encounters. Awesome. I'm gonna get my stuff. I'll be over in a bit. Come on. I love you mom. You're so good. Dude, what took you so long? Expecting someone so late? Uh, no, no, just uh, Woody. Wow. I guess I haven't been here in a while. Your mom moved everything. Uh, yeah, yeah, I guess, like a year ago. Where'd your folks go all dressed up? Um... date night. Good. Huh. Better view of my room than I thought. I've never seen you naked. That's too bad. I've got a great body. Wow. When I gave you that first journal I did not think it would lead to this. God, we used to have so much fun. Sucks how much things have changed. Uh, yeah... yeah. Things have changed. You know, like good things. I think we're old enough to hang out together now. It's too bad I'm leaving. Davey? We're back. Fuck me. Sweet dreams. Thanks again for everything, Mrs. S. Any time. Call when you get home so we know you're safe, ok? Yeah, it's cool, I will. See you tomorrow. Get down, shit-for-brains! Woody, what're you doing? You're gonna lose him! Go! Christ, I'm freaking out, ok? My mom catches me, I'm dead shit! Woody, relax. You said she was sleeping off a 36 hour shift. She's gonna be out for hours. Yeah, and you look like you're 30. It's gonna be fine. Now, go. Hurry up. Keys... Oh my god. Hey, Woody. Where were you last night? I thought you were coming over? Yeah, um... sorry, my mom needed my help. Oh. You'll never guess who showed up at my door instead. Nikki. No way. There is a parallel universe with butt-fucking wookies where Nikki showed up at your house last night. I'm serious! She was-she was about to kiss me when my parents got home. Guys. Guys, Mackey's coming out. We are picking up this convo later. Yeah, ok. 'Is that a fuckin' pick axe? Holy shit. That is a lot of dirt. Just like Kyle said. How many bodies do you think that would bury? We gotta keep following him. Go. You drive like my grandma, dude. We're gonna lose him. Shut it, Eats. Woody, look out! Woah! The hell, man?! Get off the road, you maniac! Great, now we lost him. Frick this, ok? I'm never doing this again. You guys are dicks! Guys, relax. Let's just get home as fast as we can and hope that's where he's going, too. Oh, shit. Fuck. Fuuuuck. It's a cop. It's a cop. Dude, is that Mackey? Everybody just be cool. I don't have my license, genius. Tell him you forgot it at home. How am I... - What if it's fucking Mackey? - I'm so screwed. Oh shit, Officer Cole. Goddammit, Dale Woodworth, I thought that was you. Does your mother know you stole her car? No. We, uh, we were just borrowing it. We ran out of snacks and she was asleep so I just- What if it wasn't me that pulled you over? You could be in some real trouble. I know, I'm so sorry. I won't do it again. You got me in quite a bind. I just can't bust you 'cause then how am I gonna look' your mother in the eye at church? I know, I understand. Mr. Eaton. What a surprise. Officer Cole. We meet again. Look, guys. Another kid has gone missing. Everybody up at town hall is in a panic. They've been talking about canceling the Bay Festival. Get your asses home where it's safe and stay there. You got it? Yes sir. Yes. Straight home. Guys, shit. He switched cars. Who cares? Where's the dirt? That's what I mean. He doesn't have it. It must still be in his cruiser. Unless he stashed it some place. We're onto you, Mackey. I thought everything was fine. And then they just... sat me down and told me they don't love each other anymore. They didn't even seem upset. So fucked up. I just feel like my life has been one big lie and I can't even talk to anyone about it. What about your friends? Especially my friends. All their parents are still happily married. Whatever that means. Well, you don't know that. Who knows what really goes on behind closed doors? People will keep stuff like that private. Are your parents happy? I don't know, I guess. Honestly, I can't wait to get out of this stupid town. God, you must think I'm such an idiot, bringing you out here for this. No way, never. Can I tell you my secret? Mmmhmm. I think Mackey is the Cape May Slayer. Mr. Mackey? Davey, he's friends with my dad. Yeah, that's what he wants you to think. They go fishing. Look, I know how your brain works. But you're wrong. No, look, this is different, ok? We've been spying on him and- What? Davey, he's a cop. If your mom and dad found out you were spying on him they would flip their shit. I know, that's why they're not gonna find out. At least not until we have solid evidence. Listen to me. You gotta stop. I'm not gonna get caught. Davey, just let the cops deal with this. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. You're like the only person left in this town I actually like. Really? What about Kyle? What about Kyle? He's twenty and he works at the hardware store. Hey, uh, who wants a freezie pop? Nice and cold, come and get 'em!' One for each of you, there you go. Enjoy. Oh! Snagged it from my dad's stash. Finally using those brain powers for good. About damn time. Give it. Oh. It's bad. It's so bad. It tastes like my mouth is bleeding. Let me try it. Oh. Guess you dickheads just aren't men yet. So, what's the deal with you and Nikki? Well... we hung out again last night. Oooh, Davey. No way. We have, like-no, we have, like, a connection. A connection? Any connection I want with her is vaginal. Oral if she's into it. Don't talk about her like that. Mackey's still out there. Look, Davey, we've been on him for weeks. I mean, if he was gonna give us a clue we'd have seen it by now, don't you think? Not if they missed it the first time. What? Everyone keeps their doors unlocked around here. Well, yeah, but this was locked last time. We gotta go in. What if they're dead in there? You said he killed kids, not adults. That's not totally true. One of the articles at the library said he killed a whole family at Pacific Grove. They said something must have gone wrong. And if it's Mackey? Fuck that. I mean, you wanna go in there, be my guest. Dumbasses first. Davey, I was kidding. I've got a bad feeling about this. The light doesn't work. You guys smell that? Yeah. It smells like... roadkill. If there's dead bodies in here I'm totally gonna shit my Calvins. Oh... You guys still think I'm crazy? Woah, dude. Check your Calvins. Guys, shut up! Ok? He could still be in the house. Hey, Woody, try the kitchen light. Oh my God! Motherfuckers! Oh, you guys scared the crap out of me! We scared you?! I nearly had a goddamn heart attack! What're you doing here? With the lights off? I blew a fuse vacuuming up this mess. Stupid cats. Why are you cleaning up after their cats? They rented an RV and went up to the lake house for the summer. They pay me to make sure their cats don't die. It's easy money, usually. You wanna explain to me what the hell you guys are doing here? Um... well, Sammy was missing so we thought maybe the Hoffmans were dead. And let me guess. You thought it was Mr. Mackey. Seriously? Wait, you were really talking to her? Ok, what's going on here? You guys hooking up? Let's just say he's more of a man than you jerk-offs. Oooh! Davey, you are my God! Oh, man. Can I get a picture of you for my shrine? And don't forget to clean your room. I mean it. I know, mom. God. Hey guys, what time are we playing manhunt tonight? I got an idea. Alright, here's the plan. No way, you still have those? While you guys are spying we're gonna plant one of these outside Mackey's bedroom window. We can use the other one to listen. Audio surveillance? Smart. Let's just not get caught, ok? If Mackey spots you just act like it's part of the game. Now, we probably have like two minutes 'til those little shits are up our asses with flashlights so let's be quick, ok? Farraday, Eats, you guys take the back yard. Me and Woody will plant the walkie. Operation Manhunt starts now. Let's go. Hurry up! Come on. Who's got eyes on him? I got him. He's in the living room. Over. Let's go. Found you, you bit tittied butthole! Nu-uh, we had time out. No you don't, I caught you. Why don't you shut the fuck up and get outta here before I pound you, you little shit? Whatever, pussy. You two are out. Ha! 'I freakin' hate that kid. I've got him. Holy fuck. Guys... he's wearing rubber gloves and he's got a bucket of cleaning shit. What? Wait, what do you mean? Farraday, he's coming your way. What's in the bucket? It looks like bleach, a scrubbing brush, and I can't tell what the rest is. Holy shit, he's got blood on him! What? Are you sure? I- I don't know. It could be paint. It's on his shirt. Shit. He went into the basement. What the hell? All his basement windows are painted over. Mackey's M.I.A. Who's watching the basement door? Hey, let me down. Alright, stay here. Watch ok? Shit! Do you think he's onto us? I don't think so. As far as he knows we were just playing manhunt. Stupid G.I. Joe walkie's not working. Well, you taped the button down, right? Of course I did. And the batteries are brand new. It might be the distance then. Those things were junk. That's why we upgraded. Are you just gonna say frick it and leave it up there? No way. I gotta make it work. Davey. Hey. I gotta say, you scared the hell out of me last night. Uh, yeah, yeah, we were um, sorry about that. Just... we were just playing manhunt and I didn't expect you there. No, I get it. There's a lot of good hiding spots for manhunt. Yeah, your yard 's full of ' em. Guess you didn't see me coming either, though. So what's up? Wait, let me guess. I owe you money. Uh, yeah. I'm ready for you this time. Come on back. - There you go. - Thanks. Hey, you uh... you're not using those things for manhunt, are you? I mean, if you want real walkies I got a couple that are retired from the force. They're inside. They're just gathering dust. You can come in and take a look at them if you want. They pick up everything. I- I can't right now. Gotta get back to my route. Alright. - Thanks for the offer. - Yep. Uh, sorry. Um, I guess they are pretty crappy, huh? Well, the offer stands if you ever want the real deal. Just come on by any time. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck. Fuck. Guys, guys, come in. I'm freaking the fuck out. Dude, it's 1:00 in the morning. You're gonna wake up my mom. Not after the pounding I just gave her. I'm serious! Emergency meeting, treehouse, now. 'The friggen' walkie was sitting in his window. He wanted me to see it. Oh my god, he's onto us. Oh, I should have just gone to space camp. There's no way he knows why we're spying on him and even if he does he's only onto me, which is why I need you guys now. When Mackey heads out for his 11:00 jog, Farraday and Woody, you're gonna follow him. I don't like where this is going. Yesterday on my route I saw Mackey dumping dirt over something in his garden. Something the size of a body. While you two follow Mackey, we're gonna tear up his garden. See if we can find that body. What if Mackey catches us? That's not gonna happen. That's why I had you grab Kyle's CB's. If Mackey starts heading back, Woody and Farraday will radio to let us know. What about the garden? He's gonna notice his plants are all dug up. Raccoons. Just like the garbage in the street. Just wait for him to leave. And stay in touch with our CB's the whole time. It's... it's foolproof. Look, we need that evidence. We gotta get closer. How the hell are we gonna do that without him noticing us? We? I'm not going by myself. What are you, chicken? Oh, nice try. What if I told Eats about that Hustler magazine we have that you stole? Goddammit, Farraday. Noah? Oh... Hello? Someone there? 'That was way to friggen' close. Shit! What if he's going to his house? Guys, we lost Mackey. I repeat, we lost Mackey. Do you copy? Fuck, Davey. There's nothing here. No, we're just not digging deep enough. Maybe he's hiding something in there. What? I can't see anything. I got this. What're you doing? How the hell'd you do that? I'm just good at working the hole. Seriously, how'd you do that? Honestly, you just... jiggle it a bunch, work it around, and it'll pop open most of the time. It's easy. Unless he's killing people with his lawnmower we got jack shit. Well, this whole night's been a waste of time. Until now. This is Dusty Dewitt's shirt. Who? Oh, the ginger? Shit. That's blood. Hey, what're you guys doing in there?! You got a death wish? Us? We've been trying to call you on the CB for like 10 minutes. We lost him. We don't have a clue where he went. We need to go, now. And Davey, you're not gonna believe what we found. Neither are you guys. Come on. He keeps a car in a storage unit? And like a million bags of dirt, too. Plus, shovels and a pick axe. Why would anyone need all that? It's the same reason he's got Dusty Dewitt's shirt. He killed him and buried the body somewhere. And there was like a bunch of bags of um... something else. They had like chemical signs on it. It looks hazardous. It said Noah. Noah was on the bag. Noah? What the hell's that? How am I supposed to know? I just know it was like spelled kinda weird. Here, hand me that. Classic Woody. What? This look right? Yeah, that's the same thing. No, what you wrote means absolutely nothing. What I wrote is the chemical formula for sodium hydroxide. Congrats, Woody. You're retarded. Shove it, Eats. Stop. What the hell's sodium hydroxide? I don't know, but I do know that it's not used in gardening 'cause I'm pretty sure it'd be toxic to plants. Holy shit. Guys, look at this. Sodium hydroxide breaks down the chemical bonds that keep flesh intact, turning organic tissue to liquid. Frequently used to decompose roadkill dumped in landfills. This will reduce the odour of decomposition. This sicko's using this stuff to cover up the smell from the dead bodies he's dumping some place. I got good news for you, Woody. It's time to tell my parents. Mackey. He's a cop, for Christ's sake. He's been our neighbour since before you were born. Dad, every serial killer is somebody's neighbour- That milk carton. That t-shit and the storage unit? That-that doesn't prove anything, guys. How could you guys go along with this? We wouldn't have if it didn't make so much sense. Yeah, and then when we were following him- Jesus, you have been spying on him? Yeah, we had to! And the more we watched, the more the details stack up. He goes jogging at 11:00 at night. He buys a ton of dirt every week. He keeps a spare car in a storage unit. Why would he do that? There was nothing in his garden when we dug it up but I'm- You dug up his garden? Oh, goddammit, David. You guys are in deep, deep trouble. I mean, it's vandalism, spying, stealing. I mean, it's unacceptable, boys. We're trying to save people. Yeah, well, you're not. Alright, we're gonna go over there right now and you're gonna apologize for all of this. And you better hope he doesn't press charges. Let's go. Randall. Guys, what's going on? Hey there, Wayne. Uh... listen, the boys have something they need to tell you. And I want to apologize in advance. Just know that... Sheila and I are as outraged as you are about to be. I'm sure whatever it is we can work it out. Um... hey, Mr. Mackey. We just wanted to say... we're sorry. You probably thought it was raccoons that dug up your garden and your garbage. It was us. Tell him why. A few weeks ago... I thought I saw this boy... in your house. We were playing manhunt... and I had this idea that... you were maybe the Cape May Slayer. Oh. Well. Uh... I'm sorry, it's just the uh... guys at the station are gonna love this. So... who was the boy that was here? That was my nephew, Jamie. He was helping me to renovate the dark room. I thought you didn't have family nearby. And we found this in your shed. David! You broke into my shed, too, huh? You don't have to answer any of this. I'm sorry. No, no, it's fine. We were hammering nails all day, he probably cut himself. Why don't you guys come in, we can call him, we can clear this up right now. That is not necessary at all. Look, we just wanted to let you know what happened and uh, the boys promise to fix anything that they damaged no matter how long it takes. Right? Yes, sir. Look, I appreciate the apology but honestly, no hard feelings. I remember what it was like to be a boy in the summer. It's hard to pass up an adventure. You are a better man than me, Wayne, thank you. This doesn't change anything. Are you high? Your summer's fucked. We may get out of this with just garden duty. I'm not risking the little of the good life I've got left. Yeah, Davey, spying on Mackey was fun and stuff but... this is way too heavy. I'm out. Guys, go home. And I'm calling all your parents and I will be telling them what happened. Go. Not you. You are grounded until further notice. I'm so disappointed in you, David. Just-look, just go home and do not come out of your room until I say so. Hello? Can you come over? It's so surreal. It feels like I was just a kid, you know? Oh my god. Look at this one. That is definitely coming with me to Stanford. Oh god, really? Can't we just burn it? What? No way. It's a classic. You know, I didn't think I was gonna miss this place but now... I can't deal. Everyone's talking to me like I'm already gone. It's wigging me out. You know, it just feels like... the end, you know? And the closer it gets... the more I feel... alone. Hey, you're not alone. After today I wish I could get out of this stupid neighbourhood with you. I'm sorry. You wanna leave? Holy shit. You got caught. Davey! My dad made me admit the whole thing to Mackey. No he didn't. Oh my god. I'm so grounded. I'm-I'm gonna be locked up until I leave for college. Wait, if you're grounded how are you here right now? Well, my parents are downtown so I- I just snuck out. Just a rebel without a cause. You're done now, right? Right? Well, the guys all bailed on me so there's not much I can do. I know I'm right about him. That's the shittiest part. Just let it go. You only get a chance to be a kid once. Believe me, I know. So enjoy it while you can. But... if I'm right, who's gonna stop him? Davey. How's it going? What're you doing here? Just kinda wanna make sure that we're good. I feel bad about everything that happened yesterday. Mind if I come in for a second? We can talk about it? Now is not a good time. Ok. Hey, you know that we've got everyone that we have looking for this sicko, right? Why haven't you found him yet? Well, these things take time. Sometimes years. If you want I can stop by, give you updates. No, you don't have to do that. I see the paper before anyone, remember? You sure? It'd be my pleasure. I can tell you have an interest in this stuff. Was there anything else, Mr. Mackey? Wow, you uh, you really got it in for me, huh? Uh... Davey, I like you. I think you're a good kid, alright? The last thing I want is for there to be bad blood between us. Yeah, me too. It's just uh... my summer's basically destroyed and... I'm pretty sure my parents hate me now. You want me to talk to them? See if I can lighten the sentence? I'm happy to do that. No, it's... it's alright. Thanks, though. You've got quite the imagination. Yeah, I guess. Um... my dad says it's because I read too many mysteries and with the killer on the loose I got caught up in it. I get it. That's the whole reason I became a cop. It's exciting, the stuff that's going on. And you wanna help, and that's great. And I'll admit... that the... stuff that you thought was proof looks pretty bad out of context. You got a pretty good brain for this kind of work. Davey, is there anything I can do to help smooth things over? Um... well, yesterday you offered to call your nephew. Would you mind maybe just calling him now? Absolutely. Just kinda gotta... come in to do that. Uh, no, no, actually our cord's really long. Just wait here a sec. Shit! Shit. Place looks great. I haven't been in here since... you must have been a toddler. I helped your dad get some stuff into the attic. My sister's in Seattle. Hmm. Not answering. Jamie's big into baseball. He might be at practice or something. Well, maybe I'll come back later, we can try him again. Uh, no. It's ok. Look, I'm sorry for being such an idiot. I promise I'll fix your garden even better than it was. No hard feelings. Sorry again that you're uh, grounded. I'm gonna see if I can get you outta this house. Listen, Davey. I'm gonna do everything I can to catch this bastard. I promise. Operator, how may I direct your call? Um, can you tell me the last number dialed from this house? The last number dialed from that residence was 555-0167. How are you guys not freaking out right now? He called himself. There's no Jamie. This proves he's guilty. We gotta get into that house to find out what's in the basement. Are you crazy? Look how much trouble we got in just for digging up his garden. Davey? Come down here. Shit. If I think she knows you're up here I'll radio so you can climb up the window. I want you to see this. ...please stand by as we join a press conference underway at city hall for an update in the case of the Cape May Slayer. We are happy to report that we have the Cape May Slayer in custody. Thanks to the fine efforts of the Ipswich Police Department, we apprehended Mr. Arthur Ray Peterson earlier today. And... I would like to bring up the arresting officer. No, I think it's perfect. Wayne Mackey. ...this is what everyone needs. I know that this is uh, it's been a trying time for our community but uh, we hope that this announcement can bring a little peace to those who have been living in fear. I'll be there in a few. Bye. Justice will be served. The Bay Festival's back on, and all because of Mr. Mackey. So while we're all celebrating I want you to think about your actions. It turns out the man across the street is not a killer, David. He's a hero. A hero. Did you guys not hear the broadcast? He's clearly guilty. And you're clearly fucked in the head. Dude, he just caught the killer. It can't be him. Don't you think it's a little coincidental that the person we just accused of being the killer just so happens to then catch the killer? Dude, you just sound desperate now, ok? Just admit you were wrong. I'm not wrong. And I know there's something behind that locked door in his basement. We have to find out what it is before more people die. Listen, Davey. Even if you were to hypothetically get into his basement, there's no way you could take anything to prove it without him knowing that it's you. I don't have to. I'll use my dad's camcorder, film it all. No need to steal anything if I get it on tape. Tape doesn't lie. I know you guys all think I'm crazy, but I'm gonna prove it to you. Look, I'll take all the risk, ok? I just need you guys to watch my back. Make sure Mackey doesn't come home while I'm inside. No. I'm done with this shit, ok? You're gonna get caught, either by Mackey or your dad or- No. Because everyone's gonna be at the Bay Festival tomorrow. All I need you to do is set up at the bus stop down the street, ok? - And Farraday- - No, dude. You know that my parents take me every year and there is no way they'd let me ditch. Which is why I need you to keep an eye on Mackey there. If he leaves the party early just give me a heads up. Woody... I need you to stay and watch right outside his house. With multiple layers of protection there's no way I get caught. Are you with me? Whatever. Fine. But if shit goes sideways I'm pinning it all on you. Yeah. This is your last shot, Davey. I mean, if you think there's something down there... I guess I'm in, too. This is so not fair. David. Punishment's a punishment, pal. If you really cared about going you wouldn't have acted like a delinquent all summer. Hey, just let me go and I'll be grounded again after. Not happening, end of story. Alright guys, it's go time. ♫ I got eyes on him. Over. Roger that. How're you looking, Eats? What? Can't take a little family time? Fuck off, Kyle. Eats. Eats? Are you in position? You want a lift, limp dick? Why, you need an alibi? Ok. Hold this. This, too. Come on. - Can you hold it? - Yeah. Here. If you see anything, make some noise. Alright? Move over. What for? I'm not gonna let my best friend go in a serial killer's house alone. Hold the window. Ok. - You good? - Yeah. I think so. Alright, let's go. Thanks, Woody. I owe you one. Let's just make this quick, ok? Ok. What are you guys doing? Why do you keep doing that to us? Because it's so easy. What're you doing here? I figured you'd need some help. I thought you said I should let it go. Yeah, but if you're right, who else is gonna stop him? Oh, come on. Davey? Davey, do you copy? Is he on his way back? Way worse. You were wrong. You were wrong about everything. The dirt, the shovels, the pick axe, it was all for a project Mackey was doing with the police department. They planted a shitload of flowers down here. Listen to me. It's over. No, Farraday, wait. I'm sorry, man. But you're on your own. Maybe he's right. We should just go. I mean, we're already here. We might as well just check it out. And if it's not him then we know, right? It's him. Look, Eats is still in position so we're safe. We have to look 'cause we're about to find the proof. I know it. Please tell me somebody brought a flashlight. Oh, uh, there should be one on the camcorder. Ok, come on. Creepiest basement ever. Jesus fuck! Oh, jeez. Oh my god, calm down. It's just a light. Are you ok? Ok. Quiet down! Take a chill pill! Shine the flashlight on the lock. What're you doing? Seriously, did Eats teach you this? It doesn't work. Shit. Vagina! Farraday, you fucking dick! What are you even doing here? You're supposed to be watching Mackey. The whole thing's off. Mackey's clean, 100 percent. Are you fucking kidding me? It's a long story. Just trust me. It's not him. Fuck that. I gotta hear this. Maybe I could sleep at your place tonight? Parents again? How bad is it this time? Let's just say I don't wanna witness a murder suicide. Yeah. But I'm not watching Gilligan's Island. What the hell is this place? You think he... keeps his victims here or something? Guys. "To Wayne. Keep it up, slugger." "1958." Holy shit, was this his room? When he was a kid? That doesn't make any sense. I mean, these houses weren't even built back then. God, suburbia is so fucked up. Davey, you said there was gonna be evidence here. Where is it? Oh my god! No, no, no, no. Davey, no, no. Just make sure you're filming. No, Davey, wait. Is this enough proof for you? Davey, we need to go. Now. Come on. Wait, what's that? Oh my god. Oh my god! Help... Come on, guys. Come on. Are you ok? Watch out, watch out. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Oh my god, Davey! Davey, let's go! Davey, come on! We gotta get out of here! Davey! What are you looking at? Holy shit! Davey! Davey! Guys, the people in the pictures aren't his family. They're his victims. What? I'm next. Oh my god. Is this enough proof for you? Davey, we need to go. Now. Come on. You found all this in his house? Yeah, and there's pictures of dead people 'all over the freakin' walls! What were you even doing there? Get out to Mackey's. Bring that sick son of a bitch to me. Let's go. You folks should be proud. That boy's alive because of your son. He's a hero. You ok? Uh, yeah. What're you doing out here all alone? My parents are giving a report, I guess. Hmm. Kinda feels like none of this is actually real. My parents just got here and... I saw them hug each other for the first time in a while, so... Well, that's awesome, right? I'm not gonna get my hopes up, but... it happened because of you. I don't know about that. See ya, Davey. I love you, pal. And I'm so sorry. I'm proud of you. I'm real proud. Davey's got the sleeping bag all set up for you. And when your mom gets off her shift in the morning she will pick you up. Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong. You guys are safe now. We'll keep an eye out and make sure nothing else happens. I wonder where he is. Well, the APB's been out for hours. They'll get him. It's just a matter of time. We love you. You boys are gonna be the talk of the town. How does that feel? Nothing's ever gonna be the same again. Alright, get some rest, you two. Goodnight. 'Night. You think they'll catch him? There's nowhere left for him to hide. It's over. We got him. Woody! Woody! Get up! Turn around. I'll untie you. It's Mackey! I can't see shit! What the fuck was that?! We gotta get outta here! No, no, no, no! Yes, we have to! Wait-he's-he's out there. Where is he? Oh, my god, run!!! I know how much you guys like games. So I got a surprise for you. We're gonna play manhunt. Only now we are gonna play it for real! It's ok. He can't catch us if we keep moving. Alright? We gotta go. Let's go. What-what the hell? Shit! Come on. Where did he take us? It's a tidal island. It has to be. Fuck. What do we do? If we-if we just keep going, eventually- We'll find a road. Come on. It's ok, it's ok. It's ok. I know where you are. I know you're close! We gotta get to the cruiser. I can't die tonight, my mom needs me. You're not gonna die. I got you into this mess, I'm gonna get you out of it. I'm gonna be your diversion. No, no, no! I'm gonna get his attention so you can get to the cruiser, ok? Find a way out! No! No, I can't- Hey, Wayne! Fuck you! I am over here, you fucking loser! Stay the fuck there. Woody! Woody! He's coming! Woody! Woody! Run! Davey! Davey! Davey! Davey! No! No! Woody! Woody! You brought this on yourself. All you had to do was leave me alone. This is your goddamn fault! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You forced me out of my home. You stole my life! You do not get to be sorry. All I wanna do is kill you. That's not enough for you. You have spent so much time thinking about me. I want you to keep thinking about me. I want you to imagine what I am going to do when I come back for you. And I am going to come back for you. After you have spent your life looking over your shoulder. After you have wondered every single day if that is the day that I'm gonna come for you. One day... you'll be right. You never know what might be coming around the corner. And that's the thing about this place. It all might seem normal and routine, but the truth is the suburbs are where the craziest shit happens. Just past the manicured lawns and friendly waves. Inside any house, even the one next door, anything could be happening and you'd never know. If I've learned anything, it's that people hardly ever let you know who they really are. Tough pill to swallow, I know. But it's true. Even serial killers live next door to somebody.
