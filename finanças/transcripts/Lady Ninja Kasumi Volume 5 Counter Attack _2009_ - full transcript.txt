Iga Estate Hey, Rokuzou. What? What are you staring for? Master Hanzo! When did you return? Is there an intruder? Yes, sir! A suspicious naked woman! Where? Over there! You fools. The intruder is right here! M-Master Hanzo! Why? Who are you? The Sanada ninja master of disguise. Kosuke Anayama, Sanada clan ninja The Sanada ninja master of disguise. Kosuke Anayama, Sanada clan ninja Kosuke Anayama! Kasumi, Sanada clan lady ninja Kasumi, Sanada clan lady ninja Did lust Kasumi, Sanada clan lady ninja make you forget your master's face? Make you forget your master's face? Did you find it? Hayate, Sanada clan ninja Hayate, Sanada clan ninja Hayate! Hayate! Hayate, you got it. Who're you? I'm Kasumi, Sanada clan lady ninja! Lady Ninja Kasumi Lady Ninja Kasumi Hanzo Hattori Strikes Back! Mei Itoya Hiroshi Maeda Masato Takaoka Terhiko Nobukuni Mari Hinata Tetsuji Konno Jako Amano Yuuki Komeyama Masaru Takada Akio Kato Kazuhiro Kojima Yoko Satomi Kenji Tominaga Tatsuko Wakabayashi Director Seiki Watanabe Hanzo Hattori, leader of the lga ninja Hanzo Hattori, leader of the Iga ninja Those bastards! Those bastards! Sanada Estate Mufu, leader of the Sanada ninja Mufu, leader of the Sanada ninja Come on, look closely at the model. Come on, look closely at the model. It's more like... They say handwriting says a lot about a man. Hayate, maybe reading and writing is simply beyond you. A silly idea. Look, I understand how you feel. Master Mufu, I'm coming in. Sure. Come on now. Did you just hide something? Well, the truth is... Oh, never mind. I was wondering why Sasuke and Kosuke look like they're getting ready for a journey. They're going on a new mission. I have one for you too, Kasumi. I was talking with Lord Yukimura the other day. We discussed finding someone to be the core of the Sanada forces. Some kind of symbol to bolster our collective morale, like Takeda's Twenty-four Generals. And so, Kasumi, I want you to meet with a man named Shinsuke Kakei and persuade him to join the Sanada forces. Is he a martial arts master who would make a good symbol? No, he's a blacksmith who specializes in making guns. That's why I had you steal this from the Iga estate. It's the plans for a new model of gun, and he drew them. They were still incomplete when lga stole them. But once it's finished, it will put all current guns to shame. It's supposed to be powerful, and can fire repeatedly. The thing is though that Shinsuke Kakei is quite an odd duck. His talent for gun making is recognized worldwide, Shinsuke Kakei, gun blacksmith and he interests even high officials. Shinsuke Kakei, gun blacksmith Shinsuke Kakei, gun blacksmith But he refuses all offers, But he refuses all offers, not just Tokugawa's, and focuses on further developing his guns. Why does he refuse to serve anyone? I don't know. It's your job to find that out, and win him over. We very much want the man himself, not just his diagrams. That way he can form a Sanada firearm squad and be its leader. I'm counting on you. Yes, Master. Hayate, what were you hiding in there? Don't you lie to me. Let me see! Why are you hiding it? Where is it, Hayate? That has nothing to do with it. Where is it? Let me see! Where is it? Why do you suppose Hayate wants to learn to read and write? Perhaps it's something he wants to show Kasumi as a person, or rather, as a man. Hayate? Really? It's proof that, though he was raised by dogs, he's reclaimed much of his humanity. That's not a bad way of looking at it. But as a shinobi, I can't completely say it's a good thing. Shinobi sometimes have to make heartless decisions, after all. Is it in here? Hayate! Show it to me! Hayate! Where is it? Osawa, Shinsuke's wife Are you going to work all night again? Well, maybe. I had a good idea to improve the gun design. If you push yourself too hard, it'll affect your health. Could it be you're jealous that I devote so much time to my guns? I never said... It's all to protect you and the peace. That's what this is for. I have a message from Lord Ieyasu. Listen closely. Not all shinobi are in Iga. What does that mean? That's not important. You have failed repeatedly at the hands of Sanada, of all people. Hanzo, even if Lord Ieyasu becomes the shogun, there's no guaranteed security for the Iga clan. Understood. There's a certain job you need to do to make up for your shameful behavior. This time, I will not fail. This will be your last chance. Hanzo's estate Does that mean Lord Ieyasu's giving up on us? Ranmaru, Hanzo's younger brother We have to succeed at this mission so that doesn't happen, even if it means our lives. Incomplete or not, losing those plans to Sanada was a disgrace. In order to regain Lord Ieyasu's confidence, we have to recruit that gun maker. He must work for us and no one else. Sanada must not beat us to it. In that case, I can do this alone. No, I have to go, in order to prove to Lord Ieyasu how serious we are. You're going to do this personally? B-But what if something happens to you? If that happens, you'll assume my identity. Me? But that's only after you come to possess what I have and you lack. What I lack? When it comes to shinobi skills, yours are already far beyond mine. But that alone isn't enough to govern an entire clan. Get ready to depart. Sayuri, Hanzo's younger sister Hanzo. Please allow me to accompany you on this mission. What? Ranmaru told me. The fate of the Iga clan and the Hattori family rests on it. So I will go too. No. Why not? I'm a ninja too. I said no, and that's final. Why not? Don't trouble yourself over this. Just focus on recovering from your illness. I'm part of the Hattori family too. I lack nothing... Manji Siblings! The time has come for you to really show your stuff. Onimanji, lga clan ninja Those Sanada dogs will fall prey Dokumanji, Iga clan ninja Those Sanada dogs will fall prey to my poison claws. Go on ahead. Where's Ranmaru? He set out not long ago. He said there was no need for you to bother going. Yeah, he would... I imagine he wants you to appreciate his efforts. I want you to appreciate mine. I'm off. Now how should I go about swaying him? Maybe I'll use sex appeal. Get back! Hide! Stupid! Come here! Are you okay? You were just hungry, huh? I was positive I'd hit you with shrapnel or something. The design's not complete yet, after all. Still, its power is amazing. Do you know guns, Kasumi? No... Eat up. Go on. H-Hayate! Don't get mad, Kasumi. It's not Hayate's fault. Osawa's cooking is just that good. How was it? Good, huh? You bet. Eat up, Kasumi. It won't be good cold. Yes, help yourself. Thank you. Oh. There's plenty still. Would you like seconds? Yeah, of course you do. This is good! I knew you'd like it. It really is. It really is. Here. You can slow it down there. There's plenty still. You must be a happy man. You get to eat good food every day. I've got to make a better living for Osawa. Lots of people must want your guns, as good as they are. Nearly everyone who crosses the mountains to get here is caught up in the idea of firepower. Here's what I want... A world in which Osawa can always live with a smile on her face. I struggle to create such a world. I suppose I'd be happy to give my guns to someone else who wants that too. You never know when it'll go off so be careful. Of course, the world would be best if it had no need for weapons like these. Don't you agree? Sure. You probably want to live in peace with Kasumi. No need to hide it. I already know. Love doesn't need words. You can see it coming right out of a person. My husband's the same way. Even if he doesn't say it, I know he always cares about me. That makes me happy. I wish there was more I could do for him. All I can do as his wife are everyday things. Thanks. This is his workshop, so you should wait out there. Where will you and Hayate go from here? Would you mind if we stayed here a little longer? Was Osawa's cooking that tasty? Yes, I'd like to have it every day! I mean... Well, we don't mind if you stay, but this is no place for you two. You should go down to town soon. Why is that? It's gotten dangerous around here lately. Then I will protect the two of you. You will? I mean Hayate will. He's dumb, but he's strong when he gets riled up. Is it because your plans were stolen? How do you know about that? Shinsuke, the truth is... She's after them too. After your plans, that is. Shinsuke, run! Quickly! Kasumi... Shinsuke, we're fighting to create a world of peace just like you are. Hang on, I'll be right back! I'm not simply going to kill you. First I'll pay you back double for the humiliation you've caused Iga! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Quit it! No! Stop! Stop... You lowly Sanada dogs weren't even worth making the trip! Honey, what's wrong? K-Kasumi's in trouble! You must be Shinsuke, the gun maker? And you... If Sanada ninjas are here... Shinsuke, you should think long and hard about what'|| happen to you if you side with Sanada. You'd be better off entrusting your life and your guns to us. I don't think so. What? The day I give my guns to you people is the day they become the tools of murderers! Now listen to me. This gun exists to create peace! What a joke. Honey! Get back down there, stupid! If you resist, your wife dies. It'll be a living hell if my poisoned claw gets you. Care to have a taste? Stay away! Master Hanzo! That arm's going to cost you! S-Sayuri! Sayuri! Hanzo, run for it! You know you don't have much of a chance in your shape! You're the leader of the Iga clan! You mustn't die! Shinsuke, is this the peace you want? Is this the peace you desire? Sayuri! Honey... Sayuri... Sayuri! Sayuri! Sayuri! Sayuri! Sayuri! Always kill your opponent when you can. Now you get to die in agony. What, you want to save this ninja? What a laugh. Here's the antidote. If you want it, drop your weapon. Nice dedication! Catch! Now what? There's only enough antidote for one. Only one of you gets to survive. Now suffer! Sayuri! Don't die! I'll get you to a doctor! I'll get you to a doctor! It's all right. My life was nearly over anyway. How could you know that? I know my body better than anyone else. That's why I knew I had to help you here. I'm a Hattori woman... Sayuri! Sayuri! I knew you didn't have long to live, so I wanted you to spend your last days in peace... Please forgive me! If only I hadn't acted like a fool! I don't care about this stupid mission anymore. I'm going to become a demon. A demon who burns only for vengeance. Death alone is too good for them! They'll rue the day they turned me into a demon! You're awake. Thank goodness. Kasumi... Hayate... Hayate... Hayate... Hayate... Osawa... Tell me. Was I wrong? As long as there are powerful guns, someone will fix troubled times, and there'|| be peace. I made my guns because I believed that, and they put you in danger. Hayate died... And I... I shot people... Tell me! Are the things I've done mistakes? I haven't stopped believing in you. Shinsuke. I believe in you too. And I'm sure the one I serve, Lord Yukimura Sanada, will make your dream come true. For the sake of peace, we need your abilities, Shinsuke. Please decide for yourself whether you'll meet with Lord Yukimura. Kasumi. Are you going to go fight again? Honey! Just let... Just let Osawa go, unharmed. I'll do whatever you say... I don't think so. It wasn't for my mission that I captured you alive. Now you get to live through hell. Ranmaru! Osawa! Osawa! Take a good look! Osawa! Osawa! Don't do this! Osawa! Please stop... Don't touch that... Don't touch it. So that dog belonged to you, did he? That's so sad. This is so much fun. I-I don't care what happens to me! Just let Shinsuke go! You don't care what happens, eh? Then kiss me in front of the man you love. Come on, do it! Let me demonstrate! Stop! I think it's about time you tried some more pois... Bastard... I bet you're about ready to die, aren't you? Wait. Don't forget about the plans. Isn't it a little late for that? You have to return with the finished plans. Me? What do you mean? Ranmaru! Don't forget what I said you lack. Run! Ranmaru! Bitch! Now we'll see who's the fiercer demon! Osawa! Please! Let me die! I can't go through that again! I can't be your wife anymore... No matter what happens, you have to stay alive! And stay by my side. Shinsuke... I'll protect you myself. No matter what happens. Hanzo! Keep out of this! Kasumi Hayate taught me. What? A demon has weakness in his heart! True strength lies in a person's heart! I fight as a person! So the human heart is stronger than a demon... But demons have human hearts too. Ranmaru! Take the name Hanzo! Then lead Iga! Destroy Sanada! Go! Brother... Go! I will! I won't die by Sanada hands. Kasumi I have to wonder... What did Hayate want to write beside your name? I know. Even if he didn't write it or say it, I could tell. I'm sure you did. Kasumi. Lord Yukimura gave me a name. A name? He said I must do the work often men. So he named me Juzo. As of today, I'm Juzo Kakei. Nice name, don't you think? I won't hesitate anymore. I'm going to make guns, both to protect Osawa, and for all those who want a world of peace. Hayate... Hayate... Hayate! As we passed by each other on the path, your eyes were looking at something off in the distance. Even if I forget, my heart still remembers. My feelings of love pile up deep within my memories. As long as you're gone, I can't control these intense feelings. They get the best of me. My name... is Hanzo Hattori! AH that we have gets washed away in this current of fate. The only things left are the feelings and the warmth we share.
