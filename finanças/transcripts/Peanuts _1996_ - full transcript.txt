We bet all we have, please win. God, Buddha, Allah... I don't ask for much, please just this race. What are you saying? Let's just win this one, who cares. Go. He's coming. He's coming. We won. Alright. Captain. My eyes are always right on the money. I'm a natural. This is amazing. For real... for real. Good job. Alright. Captain. How much did we win? About ¥6,000,000. There's no mistake, it's 6,000,000, right? No mistake. Stop asking. Captain. Peanuts Rakkasei Ryuji, get up. Get up, get up. Get up. What do you want? Ah, Captain, good morning. We're going out. What? Where are we going so early? To the car shop. What? We're going to buy a Cadillac. For real? Are they not open yet? It would seem so. Ah. This is what we need. Right, Captain? An Eldorado? I guess it's fine. You guess? What do you mean? This is a lucky find. Hey Tetsu. We have customers. Hey Tetsu. Hm? Wow. They say the early bird gets the worm​. OK. OK. Welcome. Oh, already open? Indeed we are. This one? Yes. You have a good eyes, and such a good taste. Convertible Cadillac Eldorado 1976... A v8 engine delivering 250 HP. Power steering, electric windows and seats, and air-conditioner. And all that for just ¥1,800,000. This is a bargain. But another customer booked it already. What? Then it's sold? Well... he hasn't payed yet... so it's not sold yet. He also called saying he'd bring the money, in 30 minutes. He's probably already on his way. Then it's no deal for us. - Let's go. - Right. Actually... if you really insist... and pay upfront ¥50,000, I could change my mind. We're paying the full amount cash. Hey Ryuji. Right. Let's see. Whatever. ¥200,000 for your tip... a total of 2,000,000. We'll do the papers later... just bring us the key. Ah. Quick. Thank you. Wait what? What's with him? Could it be... Good doing business with you. Hey wait. He tricked us. Captain... We're coming in. - Hello. - Hello. Why are you smiling? Why? It's nothing. Right. - Hello. - Hello. Hey. The fish seller's contract. Alright. You're bringing small change. Mr. Magimura... We're not doing charity. This fish seller will never be able to pay us back. If I remember correctly, you have a daughter, right? My daughter? Why involve my daughter? Sir... Please leave her out of it. Hey. Don't think you'll get away from us. If you care for your daughter, pay back your debt. Put your seal on this contract. Hm? Do it. Come on. Stop. I'll do it. It's a good car. The wind feels good too. And I love the rumble of a 8 cylinder. What's wrong? It's nothing? Ah, you want to drive? Let's swap. It was quite expensive. Don't be stingy, money comes and goes. We payed twice the 1,800,000, plus 200,000. Money's worth depends on how much you care. Right, I'd rather have paid less though. So, you don't want it? No, no, I want to. OK, let's go, let's go. You bastard. What the hell. Hey. Sir, are you OK? Hey. To the hospital. Let's do that. P-please wait. Please not to the hospital. Anything but the hospital. What? Ah, was that an insurance scam? I would never. I'm so sorry. I'm going home. Sir, wait. Hey, hey. We'll drive you home. For now, get on. Fish Shop Like this. - There. - Thanks. Lie down. Hey, that's my hat. Get him some water. Ah, OK. You sure are heavy. Where's the water? Will That's concerning. You really wanted to die? Give me a break. You were going to get us in trouble. Ryuji. Maybe you can tell us what happened? I just have to die now. I was stupid from the start. I knew they were Yakuza... I got involved in their gambling... my debt snowballed... soon it was out of control. So I told them... I'm so deep in debt they can have my shop... but those Hyakkikai guys want my daughter too. "Hyakkikai"? They're running that gambling den. Where's that den? Captain... What are we going to do? Just get in. Welcome. ¥1600? That's nice. That's it. - Sir. - Yes? Do you sell scarves to? We do. Look there. What's that? Kabukicho in Shinjuku Hyakkikai is a violent gang. On top of their gambling operation... they run a cocaine and prostitution traffic. I heard they also offer contract killing. - Please sit down. - Go ahead. Sit here, Sir. - All present here. - Here too. Bet. - Utsuki. - Utsuki. I was so far off. No good. Keep it up. I removed your interest too. Here. Bye. Don't move. Who are you? If you move an inch... you're dead. That's amusing. You intend on robbing the Hyakkikai gambling den? Hm? Take back the sum you wagered. Don't ever come back to such a dangerous place. Captain, I'm done. Wake up. Kurogane Mitsuzo And so you've never seen those two before? Right. They were hiding their faces... but I'm sure I don't know them. You were high on cocain... I can't trust you. No, I'm telling you . Idiot. I didn't call you to hear excuses. You know how much I lost because of you? What do you think I employ you for? Idiot. Apologize. Muto. That dirty finger of yours is just an extra... I still want my money plus the costs, in total 3,000,000. That's all. Go fetch the money now. You always manage, Mr. Kurogane, we can't affort losses. You're good at making money. Because I need so much of it. Since bribing a certain inspector isn't free. Mr. Yabe, it's as you heard... The guys who attacked Hyakkikai were not amateurs. Could you investigate it? It's my duty as a paid detective to investigate and do my utmost. We'll be sure to offer you a bonus for this case. Music to my ears... I'll start the investigation now. Mr. Muto. You're a real yakuza now. When you joined I didn't figure you'd make it that far. Shut up and wag your tail like the good doggy you are. It's good for you. Bye. Hey, Takakura. Yes? What was that 'bonus' about? You get that out of your own pocket. Leave it to me. Fish Shop Ah, what's this? Use it to repay your debt. Should I? It's clean money. I can't possibly accept this much. But why are you... so nice to me? You don't need to worry. And such a large amount of money. It's alright. This money comes from Hyakkikai. In a way it's the money they took from you. But the guys at Hyakkikai... don't see it that way, they need it back. So go ahead and pay your debt in full. Don't cause anymore trouble for your daughter now. Thank you so much. You don't have to thank me. Since I caused my late parents so much trouble... it's my way to repay my filial piety debt. See you. Please wait. My daughter will be here soon, wait. Come on. Hey. You too. Thank you so much. - Sorry. - Sorry. Mary? Are you back? I'm home. Sigh. Instead of meddling we could have spent it on steaks in classy restaurants. Hamburgers are good too. We don't have any money, what should we do now? Right... Should we go back to horse racing? I'll take a nap. You're so relaxed. Hm? What's this? Ah, I had this. Where did you get that wallet? I took it when we raided Hyakkikai. I had completely forgotten it . We'll have all the steaks we want. What is it? It's such a nice car. Thank you. We have so much free time. Could you take us for a drive? We too have spare time. Right, captain? You said so too? Alright. Then you get on the other side, and you come here. Move on the side. We need to get on. There. Go there please. Captain, move for her to get in. Just get in. Ah, I'll get in first. - It feels so nice. - It does. - It feels good. - Your skin is so smooth. - Really? - Yes. I wonder. Now you did it. I'm scared. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Here I go. What are you doing captain? Let's party. Isn't this going a bit too well? What are you saying? It's because we're cool, it's normal. Really? Yes. You're already starting? - Aya, should we drink too? - Yes. - I'll make a drink. - Go ahead. Aya, you really have a nice skin. Even as a woman I'm seduced. Ah, so nice. Easy now, stop staring. So hot. Let's have fun tonight. Cheers. Yeah. I, Ryuji Hoshikawa will chug. Ah, I can't. Are you OK? Wow. Do you like them? They're big. That's nice. I won't let you sleep tonight. What? Then I'll drink some more. Hm? This is weird. - What is it? - It's just... captain... I feel a bit weird. The world is spinning around me. Ryuji? Is it really alright? It's fine. Sleeping pills directly from the US, ¥5,000 a pop. They'll be sleeping until morning. I don't know from what rich family their from... but they're loaded. What are you doing? I thought something was off. Let go of me. I'm backed up by the yakuza. Don't act tough. I thought so. We're with the Hyakkikai. Leave the money and go if you wanna live. I do want to live, but you won't have my money. Hyakkikai Mr. Fukada... Help me out a bit. I've been raising funds... but there's no way I can get Kurogane's 3,000,000. There's nothing I can do for you. By collecting debts I managed ¥2,500,000... but I'm missing 500,000. I'll pay you back later. Mr. Gori, please don't ask the impossible. Sure I practice loaning... but I'm Kurogane gang's front company. If he knew I lent you money... Kurogane wouldn't forgive me. I'll repay you and more. I can't be interested, no is no. If he just knew that I came here... he'd be mad. I'll excuse myself then. It's Daigoro, even I know it... What the fuck do you want? Where's your boss? Who are you? We're getting nowhere with you, get lost. What'd you say? Come here. What's going on here? Hm? Are you Hyakkikai's boss? So what if I am. Those girls tried to swindle us. I came to get compensation. Are you stupid? Where do you think you are? We're in 'Hyakkikai', a petty yakuza office. Hello. - Ah. - Ah. It's you bastards. What are you doing? They swindled us too. Boss. Don't kill them. I can get all the money for Kurogane. We can sell their organs for a good price. And sell the girls to the Arabs. Bastard. It hurts. It's hurts. It hurts... Hey. We're sorry about all that. You're not going to Arabia, isn't that great? Promise to never turn tricks again. - OK. - OK. By the way, are you free? What? I mean... Right? Let's resume our date. OK. Captain. - Yes? - Can I borrow the car? Sure. Here. Thank you. Let's go. - Good luck. - Thank you. Hey. What? Captain. Bye then. Excuse me. Thank you for earlier. I'm Fukada, from the Fukada company. You have strength, guts, you're amazing. How about working for me? I'll pay you a good salary. Really? Of course. If you're interested... give me a call. Remember, I'm Fukada. Looking forward to it. See you. It's been a while. It's been 2 years. I'm sorry... for calling you out in such a place. So? I'm... I'm getting married. But... I still... love you. I always did. I can't move past you. Just forget me. Me and you... don't live in the same world. Muto... I'm getting married, don't you care? Do you have an idea who did it? Yeah. A man payed his huge debt right after the incident. Who's he? He's just a fish seller... but just before he repaid his debt... two young men visited that man. And so? Probably the guys who robbed the Hyakkikai den. Who are they? I don't know... Please investigate in depth. Here's for your effort. Thank you. Underboss, I appreciate your sense of business. And how's your boss? He's busy taking care of his 'Achilles heel'. You mean his daughter? Kurogane's name is feared in all the yakuza world... but he can't handle his daughter, Yukari. Everyone has a weakness or two. I'm off. It was a mistake sending you to study in America. I don't think it was a mistake. I really love George. You had o chose a black man? Yukari... it's not too late even now. Listen to me and break up with him. Papa... I'm leaving this house. It doesn't matter if we're poor... as long as I can live with George and my baby. I won't allow it. George will come pick me and my baby next week. Papa, say whatever you want... but I'm staying with George. Takakura. Takakura. Excuse me. Idiot. Come right away when I call you. Bastard... Yukari is... you bastard... bastard... bastard. Kill George. But... George is your daughter's... Yukari is not listening to me. Yukari is under the spell of that black guy. She'll come to her senses once he's dead. As soon as he arrives in Japan, you kidnap and kill him. Understood. Have Muto do it. Why Muto? We have to put him to good use. That's not good. Why? If someone hears Muto did it... she'll know you're behind it. Leave it to me. I'll won't fail you. OK, do that. Make sure Yukari doesn't know. Looks like it didn't go well with that girl? Well... it all went well with Aya. You should be happy then. But I can't. Why not? It's just... I ran your Cadillac on a street lamp. - What? - I'm sorry. Are you wounded? What? I'm asking if you're hurt? I'm fine. I'm relieved. But, the cost of repairs will be expensive. I'll work to pay for the damage. Don't worry about it. We have the money from Hyakkikai. We can't use it, we need it for our daily expenses. Then let's work. Work? Us? I found a good job opportunity. You like it? I do, I'll work hard. 5th floor - Fukada Entertainment Business I see. So you'll work for me? Yes, please. With me, the harder you work the more you're paid. No doubt you guys will earn a lot. - Really? - Yes. That's how it is. I need you to collect a debt, a club in Ginza. OK. Go to to the section chief in KS Products Company. His debt amounts to ¥2,500,000. That's quite a sum. Yes. He paid cash for the first installment... but after that, he hasn't paid for 6 month. He's skipping the debt all together. Yes. If you successfully recover it, I take half... and you get a 10% share. What? That's just ¥120,500? Ah right... This is his business card. KS products First Sales Section Chief, Yukichi Sugiyama. A woman who owns a few of my stores requested it. I'm counting on you. OK, OK. So captain... Let's go barge in their place. Don't rush it. Even if we barge in and ruffle him... he doesn't seem to be the kind to yield. What do we do? Hello, this is the KS products First Sales Section. My name is Ochiai, I would like to speak to Section Chief Sugiyama. Please wait a moment. - Chief Sugiyama. - Yes? There's a call for you. Who is it? Someone called Ochiai. Ochiai? No one I know. It's probably a commercial call. Get rid of him. Hello. I'm sorry the manager is in a meeting. Is that right? Then I will call again later. Excuse me, could I ask you your name? My name? I'm Ms. Makimura. Ms. Makimura? OK, goodbye. Captain... what happened? It's nothing. Miss. Makimura... Yes? So? Are you free tonight? No, I am busy. The truth is you're free, right? Just spend some time with me. I really am busy. An order from your Chief. There. Spend time with me. That's good. They say a good cook in the kitchen is a harlot in the bedroom. Is that true for you too? Hello. Is Miss. Makimura here? Yes. These are for you. - For me? - Yes. There's a message too. Thank you. "I know you, but you don't know me." "Tonight at 7:00..." "I will be by the fountain in the America-bashi park." Underboss. Have you collected the money? Not yet. "Not yet" doesn't cut it. Right. Sugiyama, is really tough. If needed, do what's necessary. So that we don't get in trouble. You dispose of him. OK. He ignored his debt while I was on the deal. Hey. It doesn't look good on me. I understand. Was it you? Thank you for the flowers. It's nothing. Um.. It's the first time I receive such a gorgeous gift. I want to thank you. Boobs. And here too. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - I'll come again. I'll come again. That was nice. Is he still going? This is the 5th bar. What's up with him? My section chief is the same. He always grumbles about details. Lately, just going to work is a drag. Ah... Sorry, all I do is complaining. It's fine. Thank you for tonight. I had fun too. - Really. - Yes. Can we meet again? With pleasure. But I have a business trip abroad next week. A business trip abroad? I have to accompany my chief. I see. For real? And so you didn't even touch her? No. I don't think I'll do that much longer. It's an uncertain trade. Why are you so carefree? I had to follow around that geezer. So, how was it? That, old man... He's not anybody. When he got off work, he went to a restaurant in Shinjuku... there he drank with a young lady and they went straight to a love hotel. A love hotel. He left 1h30 later... then took a taxi to Roppongi then Hashigo in Ginza. All the places were luxurious. He's probably has his hands in criminal business. Hm. So that club owner in Ginza is the boss's girlfriend? Right. She's the second wife of Takakura, the underboss of... the organized crime group: Kurogane gang. Kurogane gang's Takakura, huh? Yeah. Sugiyama chose the wrong opponent. There's no concrete evidence but... I heard Sugiyama smuggles drugs on his business trips abroad. He smuggles drugs? He's a listed company businessman... duly paying his taxes. He's probably bringing in marijuana and coke. A hardcore criminal. I have a business trip abroad next week. I have to accompany my chief. Hey. Please wait a moment I was asked to collect a debt by a club... And the one I have to collect from... is Section Chief Sugiyama your boss. So you approached me? Yeah. I approached you to use you. But I changed my mind. I can't make you Sugiyama's accomplice. So you're worried about me? Yeah. Thank you. I have to go. I could invite you to my place. I'm sure my father would like you. Some other time. Goodnight. Goodnight. So you robbed our gambling den. What? Don't play dumb. I couldn't figure how the fish seller paid his debt... My men monitored him. Looks like you can use your head a bit. Shut up. Because of you Hyakkikai fell apart. I can't let you live. Sorry. What? It was great. Really? I told you I'd never lie to you again. Is that so. That's right. Hey. I've wanted to ask you... What? What's your relation with Ochiai? Well, we're like brothers. I see that. But your not real brothers... and you're not lovers... Obviously not. Well, let's put it like this... me and captain are like peanuts. - Peanuts? - Yeah. There are two peanuts in a pod... Right. That's me and captain. We're two peanuts in the same pod. Hm. But you're the one I love, Ai-chan. I can see that. You do? OK. Then let's do it again. OK, OK. I was a little hasty earlier. Yes a little. This will be your resting ground. How do you like it? Scums like you... are better off dead. Die. Sorry, I'm closing. Could I have just one glass? Ah, I'm really sorry. I'm all out. Hey. Boss. If you don't mind sharing... how about a glass? Thank you. Hey. Let's drink somewhere. Weren't we going to drink? We can drink here. Muto Hito. It's my brother's grave. He was a ruthless yakuza... but he treated me kindly. It's bourbon? He used to like it. We lost our parents when we were kids... and were brought up by relatives. My brothers was always there when I was bullied. How did he die? He was murdered. An rival gang sent a hitman... to kill him. That man was a legendary hitman. That guy... between age 16 and 19, killed 20 people. And so... I decided to quit my job... and I joined the Kurogane gang, my brother's gang. Kurogane gang? I thought, as a yakuza... I would meet that hitman one day. And would... exact my revenge. Sorry, this is so gloomy. I got carried away and talked too much. It's fine. - Welcome back. - I'm back. It went well. I swapped the bags with Sugiyama, he didn't notice. Sorry for getting you involved. Actually it was much fun. OK. They're late. Well... they should be coming soon. We're back. Ah. This is Ochiai. This is Mr. Takakura from Kurogane. Hey. So you're Mr Takakura from Kurogane. Sorry for the wait. Sugiyama's debt money is all there. Boss... There's no money. What? What is this? You said on the phone you collected his debt. I did collect his debt... but I didn't say in cash. Fukada... Don't mess with me. It's cocaine. Oki. Yes. It's top quality. I see. Sugiyama's debt is paid off now. Fine. Take this. Just take it. Come on, don't refuse it. I'm not refraining, I just don't need it. I see. Do as you please. We're going. How long is it going to take? This isn't a game. I have my position to think of. Do something about is plea... Pay what you owe. We have many young, reckless people here. Got it? You're always too nice. Excuse me. I brought what you ordered. As usual your skills are unique. We reeled in a big fish. Who is he? Kyotaro Ochiai. Otherwise known as... Kyotaro the Annihilator. That's him? He's the one who was called the genius hitman. He was known to surely hit his target. On his 20th birthday... he suddenly disappeared. He's a legend. Muto. I'll finish him. Muto. Listen. Listen, Muto. I'll tell you when to act. Understand? Don't go on your own before then. Got it? Oki. Yes? Go fetch Sugiyama from KS products. Alright. He'll be all yours after that. Got it? Captain... Invite Mary on a date, don't just stay here. Ah, it's Aya. Hello. Yes? Captain. It's me, Takakura. Here... we have Sugiyama. He meddled with our drug operation. We're going to kill him. It's none of my business. Whatever. Sure. Oh, by the way... Sugiyama's cutie assistant is also here. What? She seems to be connected to you somehow. I'll be waiting for you, Kyotaro Ochiai. Captain... I swore I'd never use it anymore. Captain... Kyotaro Ochiai. Otherwise known as... Kyotaro the Annihilator. We know you two robbed Hyakkikai's den. You'll have to pay for that. Kyotaro Ochiai. Or should I say Kyotaro the Annihilator. So? There's a job I want you to do. What is it? I want you to kill a man. Captain. Who's he? A lowlife black man. What kind of man is he? A depraved man. He raped my only daughter, for money. He even left her with a child, he's a monster. Funny coming from you. I hear you do much worse. That's right. If my daughter wasn't involved... I'd kill him with my own hands. If you succeed, I'll wipe your slate clean... you'll leave with your girl. Before that... I want to see that she's unharmed. Fine. Can't breathe. I'll come along with this girl. I'll see if you succeed in your task. If you get any weird idea... or if you fail to kill him, we kill her. I get it. You can kill him with anything but a gun. Captain. I'm coming too. I'll be fine alone. Ryuji... Once I'm done with this... we'll go back to the race tracks. You're talking about horses now? We need an insurance to bet on a black horse. An insurance? Yes. We need it for the next race. The mare and her colt... are the insurance for the black horse race. What nonsense are you blabbering? Let's go. Do a good job. Ochiai is coming your way. Are you ready? All good. Loser. Hey. Mr. Yabe... - Mr. Yabe. - Yes? That hurt. Let's go. He's on the move. OK. Don't lose sight of him. That's the moment of truth. What? What? He disappeared? What's the meaning of this. Wait, you bastard. It's getting busy again. I want to pee. Sit down. I'm telling you to sit down. So it won't be that easy, huh? Bastard. Help me out old man. O-OK. Here I come. Take this. Bastard. - Kill both of them. - Yeah. Hide here. Don't come out. Got it? You go there. - Alright. - Alright. Boss, Boss. Hey. Sorry, I couldn't help you. What? I moved George to someplace safe. You betrayed me? He's with your daughter and the kid. Yukari? Where's Yukari? I can't tell you that. You know, lying isn't ethical. Lying you say? Your daughter loves George very much... and George seems to be a good man. He will be providing for his family... without using to your money. That's a lie. Listen. I'm the only one who knows where your daughter is. If anything happens to one of us... you'll never know where your daughter is. If one day you sincerely wish for the happiness of your daughter... then I'll take you to them. I leave the rest to you. Chief, the phone. Ah. Hello, this is Sugiyama. Ah, Mr. Ochiai... Thanks for having them 3 escape abroad. Oh no. It wasn't hard to do. Right, Mr. Ochiai... if you need anything please do let me help. Right. Yeah, thanks. And could you give Mary the day off? Sure, of course. If you want... I could pay her an exceptional 10 day leave. That would be nice. Please do so. It's all good. Then let's have fun today. Go.
