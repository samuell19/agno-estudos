- Thank you Jesus! Thank you Lord! Oh, we received justice for these children. Thank you Jesus, that they convicted! Yes, yes! Glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory! Hallelujah! Yes, Jesus! - There were still many signs of grief today and then signs of relief and also tears of joy as New Yorkers received word that the Monster Mom had been found guilty on four counts of first degree murder. The jurors deliberated for only an hour today and they-- (loud vocalizing) - No singing in the holding room, ladies. - Will you honor the unofficial list? - No, non-union go home. - [Voiceover] On everything I love, I hate people because they're the fucking worst. - [Nique] I'm so sorry. - [Caleb] Move. - I had to-- - [Voiceover] I mean, I just can't take it just how dumb and lazy most people are. (indistinct talking) - I took some petty cash to make copies. I didn't have enough for more. - Do you have a debit card, sweetie? - What? - (mocking) Do you have a debit card, sweetie? - I have my debit card. - So. - [Voicemail] It's so awful, it's entertaining. It's so ugly, it's beautiful. - Morning. Do you know how many dancers per group? - Twenty. - [Alan] Do you know if they're seeing non-union today? - [Caleb] No. - [Alan] No they're not, or no - NO. [Voiceover] And it's my belief that when we aren't in tune with reality, when we aren't accepting of what's real, of the truth of the ugly of our whole selves that life loses all light, loses all purpose, loses all meaning, loses all beauty. For without acknowledging truth, recognizing that ugly exists, is inherent in all, without establishing that, there's no way to determine beauty. To prove beauty exists, beauty is in comparison to ugly. For there to be beauty, there must be ugly. It's a fact. It's ugly. It's beautiful. - She's an apprentice. - What? - There are a lot of girls out there. - So we have to type. They're all union? - Yes. - Bring them in in groups of 20. - Brilliant. - What? - Nothing. - [Voiceover] And so therefore, we must not make believe. I cannot make believe that all is equal, that all is good, that there is no ugly, no worse, no difference. Things must be relative to something else. - Alan! - [Voiceover] In order for good to exist, there must be bad. To recognize happiness, you must experience sad. - Go set up studio D. - But that session is not until 4. - Clearly, you need the extra time. - Are you ready? - Yes. Ladies, follow me quickly. - [Voiceover] It's duality. It's beautiful. (upbeat music) - Before Johnson begins I just wanted to thank you divas for coming out today. - [Girl] Thank you! - OK. Johnson. - [Johnson] Breathe, ladies. Breathe. This has a very jazzy, sexy feel. We need length, stretch and technique. It's very sensual, think sassy, OK? Let's begin. We have one, two, back three, four split left, right, left and right. Again, we have out, back, step to the left... - [Voiceover] We are blessed with certain gifts and we are cursed with certain misgivings that we cannot aspire to be more than we inherently are and we don't all know that, but we should. (Johnson instructing) - Can you get some coffee? - [Voiceover] It's a tragedy. It's an epiphany. It's transcendent, its ugly, it's...beautiful. (hip hop music) - [Alan] Hi guys, thank you so much for coming. So in five minutes we're going to start. I'm going to call all your names and you're going to line up over here- - [Caleb] Take this to the table, thank you. - [Alan] But-- - [Caleb] Thank you. OK, can I have Kyley Taylor, Kimmie.... You, Kimmie, and Cat Davis. All right. You three, 16 bars, strict 16, they will cut you off. By the door please, thank you. Everybody else, thank you. - Thank you Kimmie D- Kimmie... Kimmie. - Hi, everybody. - Hi, Kyley. What will you be singing for us today, hon? - Uh, "Mean to Me". OK, sorry, I'm a little nervous. I'm kind of new to singing. - Oh, you're new. How new? Uh.. Like, I don't know how to answer that. Like, new new? - [Ricardo] You'll be fine, sweetie. - [Johnson] You'll be fine. (piano playing) - ♪ You're mean to me ♪ Why must you be ♪ mean to me ♪ Gee, honey ♪ It seems to me ♪ you love to see me crying ♪ I don't know why ♪ I stay home ♪ each night ♪ When you say you'll phone ♪ You don't and I'm left alone ♪ Singing the blues ♪ and sighing ♪ You treat me coldly ♪ each day of the year ♪ You always scold me ♪ Whenever somebody is near ♪ Dear ♪ It must be great fun to be ♪ mean to me ♪ You shouldn't forget you see ♪ What you mean to me ♪ - Well, you shouldn't be scared sweetie, that was lovely. - So pretty.

(sighing) So pretty. - [Caleb] Shut up. - [Ricardo] Fuck you. - Thank you, Kyley. - Thank you! - [Kyley] Thank you! (affirmative murmuring) - Caleb, you can tell them that we're done for the day. Thank you. - All right, ladies, ladies. You, wonderful. Everybody else, thank you. - Do you know when they'll be making calls? - No. You shouldn't worry about it. - [Elliott] Yoohoo, Caleb. Caleb! Hey, stop acting like that. - (mocking) "Stop acting like that." You're such a fucking faggot, I swear. - You're a faggot, stop. - You should go home, we're not going to see any non-union today, plus they don't want any negros. They cut us all. - I'm only half negro. - They don't want you either, Paki. - Shut up. - Did you make the copies of those scripts I asked you about yesterday? - No, the machine is down. - People are waiting on these scripts, Caleb. They have to be delivered. - OK, I can have an intern go and do it- - Or you can go. Thoughts? - Ow, bitch. - "Ow, bitch." You should go home. We're having appointments pretty soon, I'll get you one, OK? - But can you get me in today? - (mocking) No, I will get you an appointment when we set them up. And stop flirting with these boys, you look desperate. Doesn't he look desperate? You look desperate, pitiful. - Hey. Uh, that's my brother. Yeah, yeah. He- he's my brother. I'm a-going. - What are you doing? - [Nique] Finish setting up-- - [Caleb] Come. I'm sorry that today was a bit messy but I-- - A bit messy? - But I literally got there and-- - I don't care! OK, nobody cares. You are the apprentice. I made you the apprentice from an intern for a reason. Apprentices have answers. Interns have excuses. - But I need to-- - It's not just about today, OK? You were gone for those two weeks. You're all messy and moody and shit now. I mean, buck up bitch! Ain't nobody got time for that! - My mother died and when she died I went home as late as I could and came back the next day from California because I wanted to be committed. I am so committed! I'm not even getting paid, really. - Oh! You're not getting paid? - That's not what I meant-- - I guess $50 a day is just too much for some bitches I guess, huh? I guess some bitches are real grandiose, right? - Please don't call me a bitch. - See, I feel differently. I feel like $50 a day is much too much for a bitch who can't remember to bring water for our fucking casting session. I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life. - I'm sorry. - I swear, you know what? I don't think we'll need your $50 services ever again. You're dismissed. - Caleb, don't. - Good day. (hip hop music) (indistinct talking) - [Voiceover] When I was a boy, I peed the bed at night. Either two things would happen: sometimes I knew immediately I would suddenly feel a warm, wet sensation on my leg and then I knew I wasn't dreaming. I would open my eyes and try to quietly and quickly hide my sheets before my mother found out. My step-mother found out. If she found out, she would no doubt berate my existence, my inability to function as a human being, to measure up to a civilized standard, that I was too smart to be so dumb and worse, that I was nasty. Dirty, like swine wallowing in its own filth. I was filthy and she would say those things, upset, as she stripped my bed of the gold-tinted sheets having me scrub the mattress with a concoction of vinegar, soap and hot water, trying to dilute the stain, clear my piss, my brother Elliott quietly laughing from his bed and though hurt and embarrassed, I wouldn't cry. I was just enraged, mad, angry, not at my mom but at myself for being 'less than'. Still other times, in the other scenario, when I pissed myself, I wouldn't know. I would wake up the next day, cold liquid, causing my pajamas to stick to my body and only then would I realize what had happened and then my mom still yelled, I'd still clean, Elliott still laughed. The only difference is that I still dreamed, I finished my dream. It was not cut off abruptly be an unpleasant reality and who knows if the dream was happy or sad or scary but, it at least happened and that happening would forever be a moment of peace. Even wallowing in piss, laying, sleeping in filth. - Oh really, Tracy? You really think I'm the fucking problem here? Really? I am NOT the fucking problem! It's your problem. I am, done. With you. - In myself, I know you just to be an eater of dust. Leave me here and lower it year by year as you promised till the last be an oubliette and my name inscribed on the four winds. Still, still I win! I have been a woman and loved as a woman loves and lost as a woman loses. I have born a son. He will rule Scotland and England. (inaudible) - [Kim] It's one thing after another. I mean, when I hired you, you were great. You were right here, you were paying attention, you were doing what I needed you to do and I don't know where the hell you are now. I talk to you, I ask you to do stuff and you're just not you're not present any more and it's driving me nuts, OK? So I'm boring you? - Of course not. I'm sorry. - The bottom line is, when I or Ricardo or another casting director asks you to do something, we expect you to do it specifically. If we wanted an intern or an apprentice to do it, we would have asked them. You're an associate for a reason. We give you associate level work to do, appreciate that. We could certainly give it to somebody else. - I'm sorry. Today was not my best-- - [Kim] It's not just today. Anthony and Pierre told me you were having the intern set up the appointments? - It was once, and I watched-- - [Kim] Come on, confirm yes, set no. You know that. - Of course. I'm sorry. - I like you but I'm not going to-- - [Caleb] I know. - Good, now since Nique didn't work out, I recommend that we move Alan up to the apprentice position, yes? - Sure, he's great. - [Kim] Excellent. Can you-- (cell phone buzzes) Kim Kelly. (chuckling) Yes, hey, how are you? So.... mm-hm. (indistinct talking) - OK, how would you like to be the next casting apprentice at Kim Kelly Casting? - What about Nique? - Again, how would you like to be the next casting apprentice here at Kim Kelly Casting? (nervous laughing) - Yes. - Good. Confirm these two appointments for tomorrow. - Confirm these appointments? You mean set them? - [Caleb] Tomato, tom-ah-to. - Hi, can I get some iceberg lettuce and cheese and bacon. - Apples, mandarin oranges, grapes. - Chicken, beans, turkey, bacon. - No, never mind, don't put the cheese and bacon. - Sunflower seeds, feta, not blue cheese, feta. Feta. - Cheddar and ranch dressing please. Extra ranch. - Chicken and croutons. Thank you. - Croutons and balsamic vinaigrette. Thanks. - Hi could I just get some romaine with salmon and vinegar? Thanks. - I love her. LOVE her. - Easy, hater. - [Pierre] I don't care if Halle Berry has a fucking Oscar. If you're not right you're not right and she is not right. - Just shut up. Don't nobody care about your casting thoughts on an imaginary movie, loser. - "Don't nobody care"? You shut up, or speak English. - I was speaking English. - Well speak it properly. - I can properly tell you to suck my dick or wait, is that what Anthony told you? - No! - Are you guys...? Oh, that was a little secret, right? - You're such a fucking bitch. I can't believe you told him that. - Oh yeah, everything. Cum shots, how big, how small, the works. - Fucks you! - About how you cried because you didn't get into film school, about how you needed someone to make you feel good. - This is not savory lunch conversation, OK? - I agree, so can we not pretend-cast the movie as some crazy bitch who killed her kids this morning? That shit's insensitive. - We were just having fun, Caleb. - Well, no. You know, next time you tell Kim about what I'm doing with the interns, I'll tell both your boyfriends about what slut-fucking bitches they're dating, OK? (nervous giggling) (urinating) (hip hop music) - [Voiceover] Over 5 million people use the New York City subway on a daily basis. 5 million people all travelling to do something, be something, get something, give something, love something, kill something, buy something, steal something, all these people. So many people going places every day. So many people not going places every day. So many just trying to sleep, to eat, to beg, to cheat, to rest, to see, to survive every day. So many people. All these people. 5 million a day and we all collide, our disparate journeys, our unique motives, our wantings and longings we're all on the same train. We're all breathing the same air, sitting in the same seats, bumping into, annoying, using, avoiding, dealing with each other. We all share this, all these people, 5 million people. Some friends, some families, some enemies. Most strangers but yet and still we're connected. It's ironic, it's crazy, it's maddening, it's stupid. It's crazy, it's...beautiful. - [Elliott] You see the one over there? Caleb? Caleb. Caleb? Caleb. - Oh my god, what? What? Who? Where? - Over there, everything's over there. Over there. - Don't point, you tacky bitch. - [Elliott] He see you? The one in the blue shirt? Hubba hubba. (mock singing) - [Caleb] Elliott, you've lost some of that baby fat unless you're going for these fat fucks, I mean really. Have some self respect. - Hey, some people have a preference. I like a little extra meat on my men. - [Caleb] Clearly. - Hey, stop. Stop. Stop. For shit's sake Caleb, stop! You're all over me. - Calm down. (teasing) ("Doing 'M Thing" by Nhojj) - [Girl] What are you doing? - [Mother] Janice, get over here now! - Hey. (kissing) (whispering) You're an hour late. - I know. Ebony and Neil, is there a problem? - Oh no, we were just waiting to eat until you got here. I mean, we are in a bit of a food coma. - [Caleb] Well, you all look like you could afford to miss a meal or two. (awkward laughter) - [Neil] How rude. - [Caleb] I'm just playing. Joking. I'm sorry about being late and everything, all right? My apologies, sugar. - Oh no worries, no worries. Wine? - [Caleb] Yes, please. Thank you. Hey, I should not look like an asshole if I'm late. The next time I'm late, just go ahead and start without me. We've been dating for three years. It should not be this serious, OK? Thank you. Thank you. (inaudible discussions) - [Neil] So, I'm sorry, you have to tell me. You two are...brothers? - [Elliott] Yeah. - [Neil] Same parents? - Uh, Same father. - Oh. (snickering) So who's older? - [Ebony] That's rude. - [Neil] What? - Who do you think is? - I'd say Caleb. - No tea, no shade. - All tea, all shade. (laughter) - I think you guys both look good. - He's a month older than I am. We're basically twins. - [Ebony] How is that....? Oh. Let me stay out of brown folks' business. - Exactly - So, you guys all work with Nate in finance? Wall Street, everything, all that? - No no no, I work with Neil and Ebony over here, she's just Neil's fag-hag. - That's rude. Real rude. - And Gus, he works for the New York Times. - Oh, that's cool. - Yeah, it's OK. - Well you know, Caleb here, he's a writer. - My baby is quite the writer. He's applying for grad school for it. - So what do you do now? - Close your mouth when you're fucking chewing. - I'm sorry. (chuckling) He's a casting director. - Assistant. - You know used to be a really good actor you know, with an agent and everything. - Don't. - [Elliott] Don't be embarrassed. I'll brag for you. - I just don't like being the topic of conversation, OK? I'm going to the little boy's room. - I'll come with. Excuse us. (chatter resuming) - You think Gus was cute? - Nigga, why are you so basic? - I don't care. ("Spring Rain" by Nhojj) What are you doing? (knocking) - [Nate] Baby, we're about to eat some cake. (water running) - So Nate, do you want to take that last piece of cake home? - Oh no, you can take it but thank you, I appreciate it. - [Neil] Oh child please, I don't want that. - [Ebony] Yes, you do. - [Elliott] I'll take it. - [Gus] I'll take it. - You want to split it? - [Elliott] That would be nice, yeah. - [Neil] So I've calculated it's going to be about $75 per person, you know with tax, for the catering. That's OK with everyone, right? (murmuring) - I'm sorry Nate, I know it's your birthday and all but I can't pay that, I mean, $75 is ridiculous, OK? I can't do that. - I'm glad you said something because that is the worst. (overlapping arguing) - I can't do that, no. Sorry. - [Gus] OK, just everyone pay what you feel appropriate. - [Neil] Nate is a good one. - I know. - [Nate] Don't act this way Caleb. Caleb, you're better than this! - Oh, are you Nate? - [Nate] What? - Are you better than this? - Yes, I am and so are you. - OK Nate, well if you're so much better and I'm not better, then why are you here, Nate? - I just know that if I could just love you long enough, if I could love you hard enough, you'll be better. - I don't want to be fixed. - Did you take your medication? - Don't call me. - [Nate] I'm not fucking chasing you any more! - Don't! (door rattling) (slow hip hop music) - [Voiceover] A man walks into a bar. He goes to the bartender, says, "Damn, "there's some hot motherfuckers in this place tonight". The bartender laughs, pours him a drink, says, "Are you kidding?" The man swigs the drink, says, "Yeah, motherfucker. "That's a hot one over there and a hot one over there "and that motherfucker is hot as dyn-o-mite. "Oh yeah, there's some hot motherfuckers in this place tonight, damn." The bartender laughs, says, "Buddy, you're bugging." The man swigs, says, "How so, my man? How so?" Bartender says, "We just opened. "The only people in here are me and you." The man swigs, says, "Really? Bartender, "Yeah." And there's an uncomfortable, sad silence, so sad, so silent. The man says, "I'm blind", embarrassed. Bartender pauses, pours him another drink, says, "Then how did you get here?" The man swigs his drink, he walks out the bar. The bartender laughs. - [Boyfriend] What's up, bitch? - [Nique] Baby, hold up, please. - [Boyfriend] Yeah, you heard me you little fucking bitch. You fire her? Huh? Huh? (Yelling) You fire her, huh? You think my girl's like a little bitch, huh? - [Nique] Baby, please! - Pick on me, you fucking bitch! Pick on me, bitch! (Nique gasping) (discordant music) - [TV Reporter] As jury selection begins in the Monster Mom trial that has rocked the city like no other crime in recent history, new details emerge from the accused social networking pages that have many asking could this tragedy have been avoided? Were there signs that could have prevented this mother's massacre? (doorbell buzzing) (door opening and closing) (footsteps approaching) - Caleb, Nate's here. - How you feeling, baby? - Nate? - Yeah, I'm here. - Get out. - Caleb-- - Get. Out. - [Nate] Caleb, come on, I'm trying. - Get out. Get out! - All right, all right. - [Nettie] So she was singing this song and she had to stop and she was like, "Is somebody singing with me?" and we looked and it was so embarrassing because the accompanist was humming along. (laughing) It was so ridiculous! And Kim had to ask him to leave after lunch. I mean, look. Nice? So anyway, Kim had to ask him to leave after lunch and I mean, who does he think he is? Does he think he's a singer in a fucking duplex or something like, it's not your time to shine, Piano Man. So anyway, unfortunately, I had to be the one to find a frickin' piano player after that... - You look good. - Elliott, get her out of here. - Caleb. - I didn't come for this today, you know I'm still recovering from-- - Then leave, Stephanie. You should go! - Why does he say stuff life that? - All right, all right. - Why do you want to hurt me? - All right, everyone just calm down. Relax. - Shut up you Paki fuck! - You see this, mom? You see how he gets? - Get the fuck out Elliott, leave! I don't want you here! Get the fuck out! - Don't talk to your baby brother like that. - Baby brother? - He's taken all this time to take care of you every day. He's given up a lot for you! - What, his flourishing career? Oh fucking please. - He has! - What about me? What about all I've given up? Should we discuss that? Do we go through that? - Here we go. We don't discuss-- - Oh, my super mother bitch! - I am your mother, don't you dare. Don't you dare speak to me like that! - You killed my mother, you bitch. You fucking bitch! - I took care of you like you were my own child! You were my child, You are my child! - I'm no part of you, you terrorist devil! - I did everything. Be mad at your real mother. She left you. She killed herself. Be mad at her! - You're a home wrecking slut and you always will be. Nothing can clean you up. You disgust me. - Yup, the slut that your father wanted. Be mad at him, not me. - Nothing could clean you up! (Stephanie crying out) You're a slut. You're a fucking slut! You're a slut! ("Wade in the Water" by Nhojj) - Hey. You good? You OK? Um, listen. I gotta run off. I have to go to an audition, OK? I'll talk to you later? (delighted squealing) - Hey! (indistinct chattering) - [Ricardo] Caleb, Nettie, please. Close the door. - Sorry, Ricardo. - [Ricardo] Check this out, she's adorable. (overlapping conversation) - [Pierre] Hey. I gotta run out for some copies. You know the machine. - Yeah, I need a coffee. - Where are you going? - I'm running a session. - You're running sessions? - (softly) Yeah. (phone ringing) - Kim Kelly Casting. I don't think she's here right now. - [Kim] Caleb! - Caleb! Can you schedule these, 15 minutes each for tomorrow, start at 2. - Hi, Kim. (chuckling) - Hi, Caleb. I'm sorry, just running. You get it, right? - Why's Nique here? - We were busy and needed extra help. I'm sorry, do you have a problem with my staffing practices? - Well, she's responsible for my attack. - You know she wasn't. I don't have time for this, Caleb. - And Alan's running sessions now? - Your tone is not satisfactory, Caleb. - I'm sorry. You're right. - Listen, I don't care. Kick him out of the room. Tell him to make calls, I don't care what you do. You have the authority, just do it right. - [Nique] Tracy's on the line for you. - Kim Kelly. Yeah? Sure, OK. OK. All right. Uh-huh. (gasping) - Oh, Caleb fucking Dwayne! I heard you were in casting now! - [Caleb] I am. - Dude, how's Elliott? - He's fine. - Aw, man. The fucking Dwayne brothers, fuck me! - Fuck. - Dude, I haven't seen you guys since graduation, wow. - Yeah, so do you want to go ahead and do your-- - [Mark] Oh, was it your accident? - Huh? - Your face. Is that why you stopped acting? - Yeah, you got it. - Oh, man. I mean, you look great but what happened? - Shit. - Oh. Shit, yeah man. That's why I moved back from L.A. Shit sucks. - Yeah. So how about-- - When I'm finished why don't you call up Elliott and then-- - You're going to have to go audition now! OK? Now leave, I'm working here. - I'm just trying to catch up, old friend. - [Caleb] No. - [Mark] I'm sorry man-- - No. - I'll just go? - Go. - You seem so sad now, Caleb, you know?

Caleb? - [Caleb] Oh my god, what? - How'd I do? - Huh? - At the audition, How'd I do? - I don't know. - But I was auditioning for you. - I wasn't paying attention. - Why wouldn't you? - I don't know, you fucking retard. I don't know. (treadmill slowing) - Well, that was inappropriate. - [Caleb] You're not talking? You mad at me, hm? You mad at me? Mad at your big bro-bro, huh? - Stop, I'm going to punch you. - So we still going to the club later or you going to be a bitch about it? - Fuck. I'm sorry, I can't. I have an audition tomorrow, so. - On a Saturday? - Well you know, I gotta do what I can until you can work your magic. Talk to you later? - Yeah. ("I've Been Waiting for You" by Nhojj) - [TV Reporter] New Yorkers react tonight, the first day of cross examination in the Monster Mom case. Shelly Lee has the story. Shelly? - Sharon, it was a day of heartache and tears that led to many more questions than there were answers as the defense tried desperately to present excuses for what many New Yorkers say they find inexcusable. Today was a full day in court as the Monster Mom looked on, despondent and very exhausted. The prosecution went hard today. (TV fading out) - [Caleb] You have an audition? You have an audition to go to, baby brother? - Caleb, don't all right? - Relax. Relax, Caleb. - Really, you had an audition on a Saturday? - You had an audition all right to go to? - You look good, Caleb. - [both] shut up! - You lie for a piece of baby dick right here, for real? - All right, OK. Hey-- - Suck my cunt, Nate. You told me he had a baby dick. (overlapping arguing) I did not tell you because I am a good person! Unlike you, you liar. You fucking liar. - [Elliott] You are not a good person. (arguing) - You're ugly! Look at you. You're so ugly. I mean, look what you've become. I can't even be around you, you're so ugly. - Yup, you got it Elliot. I'm ugly. - Yes. - I'm everything you said and more, you know what but at least, baby brother, at least I'm something, Elliott. At least I'm something. You, you are no one. I feel sorry for you. - Oh, don't. Don't feel sorry for me. - I feel so sorry for you, boo. - I feel sorry for you, don't feel sorry for me. - You actually think that you are working with something. You actually think that you have some talent. Really, you've been in the game for almost a decade now and you have no receipts, OK? No credits whatsoever. You know what Nate? No no no. His mom made me give up going to writing school so that I could go to the conservatory with him because they would not take his sorry ass unless I came too, cause they knew he was nothing. I gave up everything, all my dreams, for nothing, for no one hell, they knew he was nothing. Hell, I knew he was nothing, your momma know you was nothing OK and I feel so bad. Day in and day out you come into my office asking me for an appointment as if I would actually give you an appointment as if you aren't nothing, as if you aren't an embarrassment. You're nothing, you are no one. - You know what, you've always been a great writer and look what you've done with that. - I've been writing something. - At least I'm doing me, all right? - Yes, do you boo. - And I'm something, I know that I'm something. - Do nothing boo. - Yeah, keep telling yourself that. - What are you doing? You're not even writing. (overlapping arguing) - [Nate] Fuck. (soft electronic music) (No audio) - [Janice] What are you looking at? - You shouldn't sneak up on people, little girl. - First of all, I ain't sneaking up on nobody and you shouldn't be in the middle of the street. What are you looking at? - Nothing. - [Janice] Can I see? - [Caleb] No. - Uh, why not? - Shut up. - You're so mean. - Why do you keep talking to me, little dirty girl? Don't you have little homeless friends to go play with or something? - I don't got no friends no more. - Because you stink. - No, it's because my momma said I have to leave this school for a little while but I got my friends Shika and Renee, my momma said they can come over my house too, so there. - You should find a police to take you someplace nice. - [Janice] I'm OK. You're the one that needs to go some place before you get hit by a car, dummy. - Why do you keep talking to me, little girl? - My name is not no "little girl". My name is Janice. What's yours? - Satan. - [Janice] You wanna be my friend? - No. I don't like you. - You so silly. - You stupid. - You stupid, stupid-head. - You a stupid head. - [Janice] You stupid head. - Stupid stupid-head. - [Janice] Stupid-stupid-stupid-head. - Stupid-stupid-stupid... (chuckling) - See? You so silly. - You're right, I'm silly and stupid. - [Janice] You need to get out of the street or you'll get hit by a car and I'll be sad. - So? - I'll make you laugh again if you get out of the street. I'll make you laugh again. There's a car coming, you gotta get out of the street. Please, please get up! You gotta get out of the street. Please, please. Please, please. (fading) (ethereal music) - [Mom] Get off of my child! What the hell are you doing? (inaudible) (car honking) - Janice! (siren wailing) - [TV Lawyer] That's when you discovered the bodies? - [TV Witness] I had walked past the door several times going to fix stuff at the other apartments on the floor and even before that, the other tenants kept complaining of the smell and I didn't think anything of it. I mean, I had asked her when I saw her coming out of the building that there was maybe a dead mouse or something in the wall. I would have never thought... And she seemed just fine. I never thought about it. And then she didn't pay her electric, I guess and I had to get into the apartment and shut it off. - [Lawyer] Describe to us the scene as you entered the apartment that day. - [Witness] The smell. I'll never forget the smell. And I immediately knew something was wrong. I mean, I almost vomited. I walked to the bedroom, it was a one bedroom, so... When I saw those, those bodies of those kids just laying there together, tucked in like they were going to sleep and I couldn't even scream, I just cried because they looked like... I cried because they looked like angels and I just couldn't understand how someone could I mean, to not even bury them they, They look like angels. And all I could think was that she was there every night for weeks, sleeping in that one bedroom apartment next to, decomposing angels just living in that smell, that stink. Every day, living with that stink. And then I called the police. - [Lawyer] No further questions, your honor. - You got a condom? - No. - Do you want me to go get it? - No. (soft crying) (gentle electronic music) (knocking) (knocking) (loud knocking) (louder knocking) (tribal music) - [TV Reporter] We go now to Shelly Lee who's bringing us the latest developments from outside the courthouse. Shelly? - There were still many signs of grief today and then signs of relief and also tears of joy as New Yorkers received word that the Monster Mom had been found guilty on four counts of first degree murder. The jurors deliberated for only an hour today-- - This mimosa is good. - A specialty. - Yeah. - I see they let you keep that suit from court. - Yeah, I guess it was the least they could do since you're still walking the streets and I'm still living on them. - Yeah, I guess. - I never hated you because of everything. I thought I should, but I didn't. Not one bit. It was like I was, Like I was relieved, you know? Like I was actually relieved. I couldn't take care of her, right? I mean, I loved her but I... I hated her because when I saw her I saw everything that was good and bad about me, who I was. I saw it all there at the same time. Everything that was wrong, everything that I did wrong. It was all there in her. So when she... When she left me, I feel so much better. So much better. So I hate myself. (bitter chuckling) I already hated myself, shit. (soft crying) I hate myself even more. So I guess I'm like that Monster Mom on TV, right? You think, you think I'm a monster, don't you? - Yeah but I'm a monster too. - No. ("Tread Softly" by Nhojj) - [TV Woman] Thank you Jesus, that they convicted! Yes, yes! Glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory glory! Hallelujah! Yes, Jesus! - My brother here? - Look, I have an audition tomorrow, OK? So. ("I've Been Waiting for You" by Nhojj) - [Voiceover] From the moment you pop out your momma's vajayjay, you're constantly going, constantly moving. You're headed somewhere, you don't know where. You don't even always know that you're in motion but you're moving, you're moving, you're growing. You don't even know it and you end up places, many different places for many different reasons, some good and some bad. Some places you get to on purpose, you wanted to be there. Some places you end up by mistake, you took the wrong turn. Took bad advice, but everywhere you're at, you're supposed to be there. For whatever reason, you're supposed to be there. - [Caleb] Kim! - What do you want, Caleb? - I want to give you this. I saw you put out a breakdown-- - You don't work for me anymore, Caleb. - I know, and I shouldn't and you were right and I'm wrong but just take this, please? Thank you. - [Voiceover] And wherever we're at at the moment wherever we're supposed to be at, it always takes us a moment to think and reassess and figure out why. Why are we there? - Caleb? - Alan, how are you? - Fine. I'll need four veggie burgers, no cheese, wrapped in lettuce toppings on the side. - [Voiceover] And we leave where we're at somehow, anyhow, and we stay in motion and we don't stop and we choose to steer ourselves to more places, different places, and we get there. It might take a few minutes, it might take many years but we get to where we're supposed to be. The route may not be clear, the journey may suck but, we get there and that journey, our trip, our many trips to get to where we need to be, where we should be, it's our life. Our lives. It's everything we are, everything we want to be, everything we will be, everything we were. It's a mess. It's never ending. It's crazy. It's incoherent. It's stupid, it's maddening, it's awful. It's wonderful, it's a tragedy, it's an epiphany. It's transcendent. It's ugly. It's everything. It's everything. It's all I know. It's all I write. It's why I write, it's how I feel. I write how I feel, I write what I know and it's beautiful. - Come on, come to bed. God, ain't no body got money for that. - I had to finish my story. - Come on, come to bed. - No, I have an audition and then I have to go to work. - Suit yourself. (yawning) You should come too. You didn't move to the city to become a super. - No. ("The Lullaby" by Nhojj) - [Shelly] Emotions are running high all over New York and particularly here in this neighborhood where the Monster Mom lived with her four children who are all now dead by her hand. We're here today looking for reactions from everyone. Excuse me, any reaction to the Monster Mom sentencing? Any comment? What about your fiancé, Elliott, how does he feel about the sentencing, having been the one to discover the girls? Does he have any sense of relief? Any comment from Elliott? Cut it. - OK, may I please have Jack McKnight, Anthony and Spencer Wong, line up for 16 bars. Everyone else, thank you so much. - [Girl] Why'd you stop writing? - I got stuck. - [Girl] You told me it was real easy. - It is real easy, it's easy to start. - How do you start? - You just write what you feel, I guess. Finishing is hard. - I don't know what you're talking about. Why won't you let me see? - I'll let you see when I'm finished. - Uh, how long will that be? - Uh, I'm in no rush. - Uh. - Uh. - You so silly. - You're silly. - You promise I can see-- - I promise you can see, little girl. - My name is not no "little girl". It's Janice. - I promise you can see, Janice. - I'm going to write and be an actor and be like you when I grow up and do movies and be pretty like Halle Barry and marry me a white man like, my grandma says, so my babies can have pretty eyes and pretty hair. - Your babies will be cute just like you're cute no matter who you marry, OK? And you don't want to be like me. Halle Barry maybe, but not me. - Yes, I do. You silly. - [Mom] Janice, come and get these groceries girl. I hope she's not bothering you. - Naw, she's my little writing buddy. - Yeah, I'm his writing buddy. - Come on girl, get in this house. Come on, gal.
