Take a left at the corner. Please drop me at that wooden door. How much do I owe you? 4,600 pesos. Thanks. It's 101:030 at the Coper Tax switchboard. Units 58, 4, 100, 500 report back to the base, over. This is Unit 500, I'll be in at 3am. Don Jorge, good evening. How have you been? Lt Gonzalez wants to have a chat with you. He has the info on the guys who killed your brother. I have nothing to say to the guy. Don't get upset. I'm just the messenger. That's all. If you have something to say to me, just say it. Calm down, bro, this isn't the way to fix things. Well, look at this prick. What the fuck is wrong with you? What's your fucking problem? We're just trying to talk. Are you gonna make something of it, cocksucker? Tell that man I don't talk to criminals. Son of a bitch! Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? Keep it down. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to, asshole? - Take it easy, man. - Fuck you, cocksucker. Look at me, motherfucker. Meet me at the car wash on 6th and 22nd at 4am. The next time we meet, if won't be for a cuddle. It'll be to whack you. That's for El Indio, motherfuckers. You guys are gonna pay for that. Let's get out of here! Remember, kid. See you at 4am, prick. Close your eyes, open your mind, get in the mood! Make some noise so they can hear us! Say it loud, we're Colombians! Long live cocaine! Where are the smokers, the dopers? Let those pills kick in! Everybody jump! Everybody dance! Let's hear it for sex and parties and marijuana! This party's just starting. Let's hear some noise. That cocaine is really good. I have enough for three days. That's why you're here, baby. Do you do this a lot? You don't even know my name. That's so nice, baby. "Blood and Rain" Easy, baby, we have all night. Caracas and 52nd. I'm not on duty. I've been looking for a cab for 20 minutes in this rain! You know it's dangerous around here. What's the matter, man? Always the same shit with you cab drivers. Why do you bother coming out? Stop at a liquor store on the way. I'll drop you where you can find another cab. It's just over there. I'll pay you double! Look out. What the fuck is wrong with you? Trying to get us killed, asshole? You drive like shit, son of a bitch! Is something wrong with you? No. You shouldn't be working like this. Drop me at the liquor store and I'll get another cab. What do I owe you? Nothing. Take care of yourself. You take care of yourself. Thanks a lot. Ingriz, come here, girl! Damn. - Need some help? - It's OK, baby. This guy's fucked up bad. You need help, baby? Ingriz, come here! Help me move him over there. Where's the nearest hospital? Samper Mendoza, straight down 26th. Yeah, that's right. Close the door, please. Let me help you get the car out. Go ahead, back up! OK, you're clear. Ingriz, come here. - Thanks a lot. - God bless! Give that dog something to eat. Don't smoke it all! Go ahead and back up! Come here, Ingriz. Good girl! So, miss. Can I leave now? No, you can't leave. You must fill out some more forms. But I told you I don't know him! Look, lady... You can't leave. This is a hospital and we have rules. If you found this man in an accident you have to make a statement. And if you don't know him we have to wait for him to recover so we can call a relative. Do you have a number we can call? Well, start treating him now. I can't wait all night. We only have one doctor and he's busy. The car... Where's the car? It's outside. Don't worry, it's fine. I have to go. Hold on, they're going to treat you soon. I can't stay here. You won't get far in your condition. Let me call someone in your family. I'll have them come pick you up. What do you say? There's nobody you can call. So what are we going to do? Leave if you want. Nobody's forcing you to stay. You're right. Take care of yourself if you're so tough. - Evening. - Good evening, miss. - Can I help you? - Is there a liquor store around here? There's a bar over there, but I wouldn't recommend it, it's a dump. - I can sell you a shot. - OK, I'll take a shot. Do you have anything smaller? Just give me a second. I took it from you to give the nurse your ID number. Listen... Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. Nurse, a stretcher! Help, please! My boyfriend's hurt! Help him, please! Hurry! Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Sorry, miss, you can't go in there. Your boyfriend's going to be alright. I'm sorry but your boyfriend just died. Try to stay calm. When you feel better you'll need to fill out some forms. Mr Jorge Vanegas... Jorge Vanegas? You? Come this way. Let me help you. Sit him down and take his shirt off. I'll be right back. We have to dry this T-shirt. I'll ask the nurse to do it. I'll be outside if you need anything. No... You don't have to stay. You've done enough already. It's alright. I don't mind. - I thought you'd left. - No. I stayed here smoking... and thinking. How did it go? Fine. They gave me some shots... ...and stitched me up. I still don't know your name. Angela. Angela, thanks for helping. So it wasn't such a bad idea picking me up, was it? Not at all. So the car's alright. The steering's just a little twisted. Jorge, I'm... leaving. Please let me take you home. Where do I take you? I don't know. Where are you going? I have to report back to the owner of this cab. Can I go with you? It's still so early. I don't want to go home yet. 316, switch to channel 10. 316, switch to 10. I can catch a cab at the next corner. But it's very dangerous around here. So... OK, come on then. Can I turn the radio on? If you want to. The other photo ID on the back seat is your brother, isn't it? How could you tell? Same last name, and you have the same look. That's what everyone used to say. Why didn't you call him? Because... he's dead. What happened to him? They killed him trying to steal this car. I'm really sorry. Where are we headed? To La Piscina. The guy who owns this car owns that place too. Good, I could use a drink. But... I won't be long... You can wait for me in the car. In the car? Are you kidding? I'm going in with you. It's not a problem. I know how to handle myself. - Evening. - Just a moment. What is it? I need to talk to Don Hector. Talk to the security guard over there. - Who's looking for him? - Jorge Vanegas. Give me a moment. Don't let anyone in. How about that girl? She's hot! Don Hector is waiting. Follow me, please. - Wait for me here, OK? - Yeah, don't worry. - Sure? - I'm fine. I won't be long. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, photographs are absolutely prohibited and do not touch the girls during their show. And, waiters, remember that everybody in this place must be drinking. Anyone not drinking will be asked to leave. Thank you very much. Jorgito, what a miracle seeing you here. What happened to your head? Sorry to bother you, Don Hector. Can we talk somewhere else? Tell your sister-in-law not to worry about the car payments. I'll wait until you can pay. There's no rush, you hear? Thank you, Don Hector. Who gave you that cut? That Gonzalez guy is looking for me. He sent two thugs to set up a meeting. And they hit you, right? And a meeting for what? To tell me... who killed my brother. The motherfucker has no shame. He's the one who had William killed, right? Yeah... That's what everybody's been talking about. Why did those guys who beat me up mention somebody called El Indio? Remember those scumbags who got caught at an ATM machine on 26th Street robbing an old lady? El Indio was one of them. Your brother organised the operation to capture them. And that's how El Indio died? El Indio was Gonzalez's right-hand man. William never told me about that. Tell Albeiro to come up here. Even in the jungle, your brother always kept to himself. Torres. I have news for you. We have the patient. Yes, I'll put Jorgito on, so you two can work it out. Hello? Hey, kid. I came out late tonight. So tell me... Why didn't you call my cell? 4am? Meet me at Do?a Rosita's in half an hour. You can tell me everything. Torres, remember how slippery that son of a bitch is. No holds barred and use all the toys you want. Take as many guys as you need. And keep me informed. Why'd you sit at my client's table, bitch? Fucking Cale?a, I'm talking to you. Take that, you piece of shit! I'm going to kill you, bitch! Kill the nigger bitch! Fucking bitch! Kill the bitch! Let that be a lesson, bitch! Cocksuckers. Stay out of it. See what they did to her, the bitches? They're jealous of Cale?a because she's hotter than them. They tried to fuck with me too. If they're all that jealous, I'll bet you need a bodyguard, right? They learned not to fuck with me. What about you? What are you doing here? - Do you work here? - No, I'm here with a friend. Tell me, would you like a drink? And ammo? It's loaded. And there's another full round. Lend it to me. Don Hector... I'll replace it later, relax. As you wish. Do you know how to use one of these? I learned in the army. Take it. Gonzalez is a moron. But the stupider they are, the more dangerous. Just show up for the meeting. Jorgito, your don't know how good your brother was at killing those guerrilla bastards. Know what hurts the most? That he was killed here, by those cheap-ass crooks. And I couldn't even help. - Have you met Mariana? - So you're the famous Jorge. Mariana was keeping me company. It's best not to be alone here. Poor little angel, all alone like me. The drunks here get rough and the girls are very jealous. This beauty is from Argentina. We were taking salsa lessons. Look how hot my teacher is! - And how did it go? - I have to go now. Let's have one last drink. The last one? Two double rum shots, please. I have to get ready for my second show. I have to go to work, Angela. Don't be so boring, it's just 15 minutes. They're already calling me. Cheers, honey! If you decide to stay, we can party later. OK, good luck! - Do you want to watch Mariana's show? - No, I have to go. Stay if you want. No, let's go. If I stay, I'll end up partying and then I'll really be in trouble. Have you had a lot to drink? Not that much. Where do you want me to take you? What do you mean? Are you trying to get rid of me? It's just that... I have to meet a friend on 19th Street. I can drop you at home or wherever you want. On 19th? Why don't I ride with you there? We can have coffee or something and then I'll go home. I've been past here but I've never stopped. I always come here to rest when it's slow. Jorge. I'm sorry about your brother. I don't go to funerals. He did so much for us. Thanks. Is that William's brother? He's a mess. How long ago was your brother killed? Two weeks ago. Hi, Marcelita. How are you? You were sleeping, weren't you? Two black coffees, please. Princess, put a dash of brandy in them, OK? I'll ask my mum if she has any. And have her refill my bottle because... ...it's really cold out tonight. I used to come here with my brother. I can tell he was well liked. Yeah. He was a kind of... a leader for the guys. What a shame. I know what it's like to lose someone you love. We were very different. We fought all the time. But he was the only one I could talk to. And your family? Spread all over. I live alone here in an apartment that belonged to my mother. - Nadja takes care of it for me. - Who? Nadja. My kitty. I picked her up on a night like this. She was just a baby. I found her freezing to death on the street. How about you? Do you live alone? Yes, in a rented room. - How nice! - Thank you. Thanks. No more drinks for this table! I'm sorry, Jorgito. - Are you going to drink all that? - Relax, I've got a tolerant liver. Cheers. Cheers. That's really good. It's getting cold. Want to get in the car? No... I'm fine here. When I was a girl, I loved to play in the rain! It was like... like a kind of purification. Like some kind of renewal. I felt really good. Something similar happens to me. I like driving on rainy nights. I like looking at the wet streets. They look clean. They calm me down. But sometimes it depresses me too. Can you excuse me for a moment? - What's up, Torres? - I almost didn't make it. It's fine. Thanks for coming. I was just organising the guys. So what's up? I don't know, man. I'm really confused. Who was riding with the son of a bitch? The lieutenant wasn't there. He sent a couple of dogs. Two guys I've seen around. And who were they? I don't know. One of them was called McGuiver. The other was a black guy. I didn't catch his name. Fucking McGuiver! Torres, I want out of this mess. I don't want trouble. Don't worry about it, kid. Those fuckers think they're tough, but they don't know who they're messing with. I'm supposed to meet them at four. Where? At 6th and 22nd. Who's the broad? Just a passenger who helped me out. Slow down man, hold it there. Lieutenant. Excuse me, Lieutenant. See that animal over there? - Torres. - Yes. But he's with William's brother. - That little fag is William's brother? - Yes, Lieutenant, sir. I thought he never talked to anybody, ever. Why's he talking to Torres? Is the little fag planning to bring a guest to our meeting? I don't know, Lieutenant, but I have a bad feeling about this. You really messed that sucker up. You really hit him hard. You bully! How could you hit a babe like that? You hit him? Lieutenant, sir, the guy has a big mouth. He was dissing us and talking back. I had to hit him. Unlucky. Can't you do anything right, son of a bitch? What were my orders? With all due respect, Lieutenant, sir... The thing is, you can't let them catch you with your pants down. Are you gonna start fighting again? - You fucked up, faggot. - It's cool, Lieutenant, sir... - I hear that guy Torres is a snitch. - Yeah? A snitch? Want a drink, honey? Let's take a drive and keep an eye on these fuckers. Fucking drive this piece of shit, why don't you? Baby, I guess you're staying home again tonight. Again! Stay home again? Back on the street, freezing my ass off. Meet me at the car wash on 14th Street. Where we met the other day? - Remember? - Yeah, I remember. - Is something wrong? - No, nothing. But I have to go. Well, then... Let's go. I'll get a cab. Wonder where he picked up that broad. It's right up ahead. - Thanks. - Evening, honey. What's up, Diablo? How you doin', boss? Call me if you need anything. God bless! El Diablo. My bodyguard! Imported from hell to watch over me when I come home alone at night. This is a rough block. Angela, thank you. Take care... So... Why don't you come up? I'll introduce you to Nadja. My famous cat is probably awake. - What about the car? - Don't worry! - Hey, Diablo! Keep an eye on the car. - Sure. Lock the door! Come in. Hello, Princess! Let me introduce you to a friend who's been hearing about you all night. Here she is. - Do you like her? - Yes. She's the princess in this house. Aren't you, sweetie? I'm going to feed her. I left you alone all day, love. Make yourself at home. There's a stereo by the window in the living room if you want some music. I'm going to make coffee. All set. Nadja's got her food. Aren't you going to sit down? No, I'm fine. Your car is in good hands with El Diablo. He's 100% trustworthy. I'll put some music on. This is a song I love. Listen to the lyrics, they're really pretty. I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Is that your mother at her first communion? No, that's my aunt. She raised me. That's my mum. Pretty. You look alike. My grandma gave it to me. It was the only photo that showed her smiling. She never smiled? Almost never. My mother was real strange. Is she still strange? She jumped off a bridge when I was two. Come on. Let's see how the coffee's coming along. I'm sorry about your mother. I don't want you to leave. Angela! Angela, wait! What? I'm so sorry, Jorge. I'm so sorry I dragged you up there! I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. - Don't get upset. - I'm going out. Go do what you have to. All night you've been saying you had to go. I don't want to stay in this fucking apartment. I'm out of here. - Leave me alone! - Listen to me, please! I wish I could stay, but I can't! I don't know how to explain it. Please, Angela. I don't want to leave you in this state. - Let's wait until tomorrow. - There is no tomorrow, you idiot. You know what's wrong? I need some blow. That's what's wrong and I'm going to get some. You can take me if you want. Otherwise, good luck to you, brother. Can you put some music on? What's the matter? What's the rush? What's going on, Jorge? Fucking assholes! - Who are these guys, Jorge? - I don't know where they came from. - All I know is they're following us. - What the hell is that? Fucking assholes! 316, do you copy me? Switch over to 10 quick. Torres! Switch to 10 quick! Watch out! Hide that fucking revolver, asshole! What's going on? Some couple that had too much to drink. Nothing for you to worry about, old man. Let's call an ambulance just in case. Close it, lady. I'm hot-blooded and I might just shoot you. Just leave. I'll take them to the hospital. Now things are really fucked up. See what you did? - Yeah, so what do we do now? - Get them into our car. - Mena, come here! - Sir! Come on, faggot! Wake up! What is that son of a bitch doing? It's your call, Lieutenant! Hide this. This motherfucker came prepared. Look at this fucking thing! Motherfucker. Let's go to the tracks on 33rd Street. Take it easy, kid. Everything's fine. That guy's crazy. He's had a lot to drink. So? - So what? - I got hired to drive a car. Not to do this. What is it you're doing? Aren't you driving a car? Fucking snitch. Aren't you? You made me look bad. Had to squeal on me. Don't look at me like that, son of a bitch! Angela. Wait. No. Wait. There are a lot of people out there doing a lot of bad things. And they are fucking blaming it on me. Like, they're saying I killed your brother. That's bullshit. I've been asking around. And I heard it was Torres. I've never trusted that son of a bitch. I don't even know how I got messed up in this shit. I don't know anything about it. Don't be such a moron. Jorgito... I feel the same pain you feel. I lost El Indio. He was like a son to me. What do I have to do with him? I don't have anything to do with any of this. Believe me. I just drive the cab. The girl has nothing to do with it either. Good morning, honey. What do you want? Nothing, love. Not a fucking thing. These? I'll take care of them for you. You too. Don't touch me! Come on now. Don't give me any shit. You're very pretty, honey. She can't leave until we get this straightened out. Lieutenant, sir, we should get out of here. - Somebody might see us. - Shut up, faggot! Would you work for me? Help me get rid of the fuckers? Help me. Let me help you. Think about it. Mena! See if a drink will clear his mind. Give me some blow. God damn it. - It's all gone, Lieutenant, sir. - Shit! Mena! Bring him over here! Hello. Hey there, Teddy Bear. I told you, I'm busy. Yeah. OK, tell me. Take it easy. I told you, I'm working! Who are these people? You expect me to sit around scratching my balls? Angela, don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you. I'll make them let you go. Don't worry. That son of a bitch had his hand between my legs. Jorge... What are they going to do to us? Forgive me for getting you into this. Sure. Yeah. Supposedly we're about to finish. Listen, the guys are probably already out looking for me. They'll find us. We'll be fine. I'm so stupid. It's my fault. It's nobody's fault. I wasn't going to leave you alone. Yeah, you're my Teddy Bear. But work comes first. You know that. What do you think this is? A honeymoon? Lieutenant, sir. Lieutenant, I... I wanted to apologise. I know I fucked up. I fucked up, man. But he came at me with a crowbar. El Indio would've done the same thing. What do we do with the girl? You know the best part, Lieutenant? We won't be going home empty-handed. Look what I found in the broad's purse. She's loaded. You have no idea what's going on, do you? Still, it's strange. They killed his brother a couple of weeks ago. He should've been here an hour ago. It still seems strange. I'll be at the car wash any minute now. Let's meet there. So, Jorgito, have you thought about it? The princess wants to go home. I told you, Lieutenant. Let her go and we'll talk. Are you telling me what to do? I told you, Lieutenant. You think this is a game, motherfucker? Let's kill the fucker right here, right now. Unit 316, 316. 316 receiving. They just found Unit 215 abandoned over on 24th Street. What about the driver? Unit 160 found traces of blood in the car. But the car was empty when they found it. Is there any back up? Yeah, we've got units working on it. We are starting to search local clinics and hospitals. Negro, take the north side. Jimenez, the south side. We're on the way. This won't take long. - Just give him the money. - Move over, asshole. I'll go. Just give him the money! Behave yourself now, honey. Tell them to head north or west. There's no trace of him at these two hospitals. OUT OF ORDER We have to find Jorge fast. Mena, there's a car coming. God damn it. Can either of you spare a cigarette? Sure. Here you go. The ATM is out of order. Come on. Let's go. Try that again and you're dead. Bitch! Please help us! They're robbing us! Run, Angela! Shut the fuck up! I said shut the fuck up! What did I tell you about that asshole? Get in! Son of a bitch! Move over! Let's get out of here! Lieutenant. They're going crazy looking for him. We're still on the look-out around 19th and Caracas and we'll try to surround this area, over. Go through Teusaquillo and up to 7th Ave. Yes, sir. We can use everyone's help on this search. So keep your radios tuned to this frequency. Starting in Sector 37-13 and into downtown. No! Let's go straight to the dump. Lieutenant, what dump? The ring road, you idiot. Lieutenant, man, that won't solve anything! You still won't have any answers. Shut the fuck up and stop whining. You're really starting to piss me off. You're really pissing me off, bitch! The old lady says she saw three men in an SUV. They were robbing a couple. Her description matches Jorge. A couple? She says they forced them into a car and beat them up. Did she get the licence plate number? She just saw it was a big car with dark windows. Alert all units. Be on the look-out for a... - What colour was the car? - Burgundy. A burgundy SUV with dark windows large, with five passengers. So keep the description in mind. They say he was with a girl and he's been picked up by three guys in an SUV. Fuck, just what we needed. What are these fuckers doing here at this time of night? Lieutenant, sir. Where do I turn? Keep driving. Get down! I'll shoot the first one who tries something. I swear. They let us through, Lieutenant. Mena! Take the next left. Fuck, I was worried for a minute. Suckers. Have another drink, honey. Have a drink and relax. It will make you feel better. Don't be so difficult! Lieutenant, let's stop this. I'll tell you whatever you want to hear. Just dump the girl. Why were you talking to Torres? He came over to me at the coffee place. I already told you, I don't know anything. So you didn't know him before? Is that right, asshole? You people think I'm stupid? Where did all these dogs come from? Fucking dogs! Turn left here. So, Lieutenant. Shall we? Who gave you that gun? The bitch pissed herself! Get the bitch out of here! I'm taking you for a pee. Let her go pee. Calm down now. You wanted to pee! So pee! Try to run away and I'll use you for target practice. You work for Don Hector, right? So does Torres. Think what you want, you son of a bitch. Answer me! Need help with your panties? Nice. Let me have a look. You work for Don Hector, don't you? Fucking pig! Mena, go see what the fuck is going on! You were there the night they killed El Indio, weren't you? Hey, cut it out! Leave her alone. Back off, asshole! Start helping me! Help you? Now what's wrong with these sons of bitches? - Mena! - Sir! Shut that bitch up! Help me, son of a bitch. Hold her down, asshole. I know you like it. You hide it well. Fucking bastard! Mena! Mena! Mena! Mena. Mena. Mena. Mena. Jorge. I'm right here. Jorge. - 958. - 958, receiving. Can you send more units to search along the ring road? Excuse me, miss. Watch his head. Let's go, miss. One, two, three. Come on.
