Subtitling made possible by Acorn Media No. Please. Aaaaaaaaaah! Challenging and witty. Indeed. And, of course, the play on the name Ernest... very clever. Clever. The problems with not being earnest... Leading to shenanigans, yes. William, there's something I need to tell you that I should have told you before. It was remiss of me. Julia, what is it? I've been offered... Well, actually, it's more than that. I'm seriously considering a new job. A new job? As head of pediatric surgery at a new children's hospital. Oh. Well, that's... That's wonderful. I hadn't heard of a new children's hospital being built in Toronto. Yes. It's in Buffalo. Buffalo? I... Excuse me, sir, ma'am. I'm looking for a detective and a female doctor couple. Would you be that? Yes, we would be that couple. There's a telephone call inside for you. Please? The other tenants called when they heard the victim screaming. The lads responded, but when we arrived, all was quiet, and the door was secured from the inside. Inside? Sir. The deceased, Mr. Garbutt, had barred this door with a chair. As if trying to keep someone out. Indeed. Any signs of foul play? That's just it, sir. We're not sure. No obvious signs of trauma. Yet he was screaming. Dementia, perhaps? Strange. His body is warm, almost feverish. How can that be? No idea. Oh, this is interesting. - Blisters? - Very recent. As one might see in a serious burn or scalding. There's no sign of fire, Doctor. Well, something happened here. And only to him. This plant hasn't fared much better, sir. Probably just a case of death by bachelor. It's very warm to the touch. That's odd. Out of my way! I must get in. I am Nikola Tesla. Mr. Tesla? Ah. Detective Murdoch. I am here at the request of my research associate, Mr. Garbutt. He said it was a matter of life and death. That it is, sir. When I examined the body further, I found several more blistered areas like the one on Mr. Garbutt's hand. And the cause of death? Well, it's slightly more straightforward in a way. In a way? When I opened him up, I discovered that the internal organs were, well, for lack of a more accurate term, cooked. Cooked? Even stranger... the damage to the internal organs increased the deeper I went, as if he was cooked from the inside. Hmm. Perhaps Mr. Tesla can shed more light on this. I'd be delighted if he would. How long? Pardon? How long have you been considering leaving your position here? That's hard to say. Some time, I suppose. Because if there's anything that I have said or done... No, William, no. It has nothing to do with you. How can you say that? You're moving to another city. It's only Buffalo. We can still visit with each other on the weekends. Visit? If our work doesn't intervene, if our schedules don't clash. You should have consulted me. William, I regret not informing you earlier, but... this is my decision to make. What will happen to us? I'm not sure, William, but you know how rarely opportunities come along for a woman in my field. I can't ignore them on the off chance that... Julia, I thought we had an understanding. We do. I just don't know of what anymore. We may be able to stay together. Or maybe you'll... find another woman who'll catch your eye. I have no interest in any other woman. William, I'm just saying, yes, this will be different. Can't we live with that? Two days ago, I received a telegram from Mr. Garbutt. He said he needed to discuss an urgent matter but did not elaborate. Was he no longer employed by you? He and another protégé, Josef Karnaki, disappeared about six months ago. Just up and left? It is their prerogative, but on this occasion, I was disappointed. Mr. Karnaki, in particular, is quite brilliant. Could Mr. Karnaki be involved in Mr. Garbutt's death? I have no idea. Well, maybe you have an idea how this research assistant ended up well-done from the inside out? Mr. Tesla, I must return to the crime scene to see if there's anything I've overlooked. Would you care to join me? I would, indeed, Detective Murdoch. I find this all very disturbing. How so? Well, I've been experimenting with ways to transmit electromagnetic energy through the air using extremely high-frequency radio waves. Mini-waves. I prefer the Greek prefix. Microwaves. And while these microwaves may distort the surrounding magnetic field, the waves are able to pass through most mediums unimpeded. I see. The thing is, Detective, when these microwaves pass through water, they excite the molecules to a boiling point. Human cells are mostly water. Yes. If you were to aim these waves at a human, he would, in essence, cook. My God. That's what killed Mr. Garbutt. But the implications go far beyond one death, Detective Murdoch. Terrifying, yes? Mr. Karnaki must have found a way to make a weapon out of these microwaves. He spoke of such when he worked for me. I rebuked him, of course. I fear I may have wounded his pride. There was a desiccated plant in Garbutt's apartment. It was still warm to the touch. Well, the microwave will excite any water molecule in its path. Leaving a trail of dead, wilted vegetation. Leading back to the wave's point of origin. Somewhere in this direction. Ah, there's another desiccated plant. Yes, and more that way. Was there any bad blood between Mr. Karnaki and the deceased? Only healthy scientific rivalry. It seemed to me, though, that of the pair, Mr. Garbutt was hampered somewhat by his conscience. An interesting observation. Perhaps Mr. Garbutt didn't like what Mr. Karnaki was doing and Mr. Karnaki decided to take care of the problem. Perhaps. At any rate, it's clear we have to find the weapon, Mr. Tesla, before it's fired again. This should be the weapon's point of origin. Remain behind me, sir. They must have taken the weapon with them. But how? To generate the energy required to kill a man, the device would have to be massive. And yet it's not here. A weapon that can kill a man through a wall? Diabolical is what it is, if it exists. Sir, it does exist. Mr. Garbutt's wounds leave no doubt. My more immediate concern is where it is. For the weapon to be made portable, it would require advancements in miniaturization and metallurgy, far outside Mr. Karnaki's areas of expertise, not to mention the money to finance the project. Miniaturization, metallurgy, and money, you say? We know a man who specializes in those, don't we, Murdoch? There's just one small problem... James Pendrick is in prison. Have you finally realized my innocence, Murdoch? Am I to be released? Far from it, Mr. Pendrick. You are here to answer questions about yet another criminal affair. Why would I? I'm to hang for murders I did not commit. Everything I treasure in life is gone. My work and my reputation are in tatters. Even my wife will have no part of me. Perhaps it has something to do with you attempting to kill her. I'm an innocent man. Mr. Pendrick, do you know a Morris Garbutt? Morris Garbutt. Morris Garbutt. Uh... No. Do you know a Josef Karnaki? No. Do you know a Nikola Tesla? Tesla? Of course. We met on several occasions in New York. Are you aware of his experiments in wireless electrical transmission? He spoke of it during our last meeting, six months ago, seeking financial backing. It was an intriguing concept, but the discussions went nowhere. What has this to do with anything? Mr. Garbutt, an associate of Mr. Tesla's, was found dead under mysterious circumstances. And we believe a weapon using Mr. Tesla's technology was used to kill him. Fascinating. And you think I have something to do with it? It would require someone with your particular talents. Do you really think I care about a weapon of the future? I'm going to hang in two weeks. Let's keep him here. I may want to speak with him again. Good idea. He can't communicate with his men if he's in our cells. Sir, his sincerity is alarming. Listen, a smiling killer... Don't be fooled by that. A man like that lives for things like this death ray. Sir, uh, there's a gentleman to see you. A rather demanding gentleman, actually. Well, tell him to wait. Sir, that's just it. He's waiting in your office. He barged right in. If you're not Queen bloody Victoria, then you'll not be ordering Thomas Charles Brackenreid around. Won't I? Terrence Meyers. Still in the employ of the Canadian government, I take it? What are you doing here, Meyers? Oh, and, uh, help yourself, why don't you? Gentlemen, there are mysterious and disturbing events transpiring hereabouts, and I believe you both know something about it. The world is changing in ways you cannot imagine. So let's have ourselves a little chat, shall we? Through clandestine operatives, we've learned that a number of international rogues have gathered here in Toronto. What exactly do you mean by "rogues"? Smugglers, really. Calling themselves businessmen, specializing in a growing field... The sale of new and deadly weapons. Now, if any of these weapons should find... Should fall into the wrong hands. Yes, yes, yes. We know all of this already, Mr. Meyers. My sources tell me that these arms dealers are here because a weapon with incredible destructive powers is about to be sold. Sounds most dangerous. We've also heard that this weapon has been test-fired for potential buyers, with deadly results. Gentlemen, the winds of war never truly die down. Can you imagine what would happen if hundreds of these weapons were deployed against us on the battlefield? Nothing we have could stop it. So instead of toying with me, I suggest if you discover anything, you should... We'll notify you immediately. No need to see me out. Well, I've never seen him like that before. Mm. I have to admit, that bit about the enemy using the weapon against us, that caught my attention. Genuine or not, given Mr. Meyers' dubious ethics, the thought of him possessing that weapon is equally chilling. So, this Garbutt, he goes from being Karnaki's associate to target practice for his death ray. Why? Perhaps he had a change of heart and was planning to betray the sale? Or he simply became expendable. So, where do we start? Karnaki would have needed a place to build and store the weapon. One of Pendrick's holdings. Sir, no luck finding Karnaki, I'm afraid. I suspect somebody's harboring him. George, let's try a different line of investigation. Karnaki's work on the weapon would have required a number of specialized materials. Perhaps we can locate where those materials were purchased. Consult with Mr. Tesla. Oh, and please tell him I'd like to speak with him when I return. - Sir. I'll bring him in. - Thank you. Detective. Mrs. Pendrick. What might I do for you? I'm afraid a man was killed last night, and we suspect a strange, new kind of weapon was used. Your husband may have been involved. Well, when it comes to James, nothing surprises me anymore. I was hoping you might be able to provide me with a list of buildings he owned in the city. Uh, I'll have the information to you as soon as possible. As you can see by the state of my desk, I'm... I'm a bit out of sorts. Yes, I understand. Since James'...situation, I've been forced to deal with business matters. I have a small army of lawyers and accountants to assist me, but I'm no businesswoman. I'm certain you will excel. A number of his rivals have offered to buy me out. It might be best to rid myself of all of this. But you surely are not here to listen to my plight. It's quite all right, Mrs. Pendrick. Sally. Please call me Sally. Sally. Might I call you William? Um, yes, I-I suppose that wouldn't be... too inappropriate. Soon I'll be divorced of more than just James' holdings. I see. I know that must sound terribly forward. But after all, you could have sent anyone here to get that list. I'd best be going. You mentioned earlier that the generation of these microwaves would severely distort the surrounding magnetic field. That's right, but it is my hope that we can solve this problem. Let's say the weapon is at some central location. What if we were to deploy compasses around the city? Then, as the charge builds... The compasses would be drawn off magnetic north in the direction of the weapon. We could then map the direction all of the compasses are pointing to. All intersecting at the location of the weapon. Very good, Detective Murdoch. But for this to work, the compasses must be deployed and monitored while the charge builds. I have an idea about that, as well. The good news is, the weapon will be fired. The bad news is, the weapon will be fired. Indeed. Mr. Meyers. I take it you've found the weapon. Not yet, but I believe I have found a way to locate it. All I need is for the weapon to be fired, and I'm counting on you to arrange that. Me? What makes you think I could do that. Because, Mr. Meyers, I believe the reason you know so much about this whole affair is because you, acting on behalf of the Canadian government, are attempting to purchase the weapon. Preposterous. Further, I believe one of these arms dealers is an operative of yours. You know that I can't divulge anything, Murdoch, even if I wanted to. Of course not. At any rate, if you want to locate the weapon, and I believe you do, you'll be sure that it gets fired tonight at precisely 6:00. And no one is to be harmed. 6:00 precisely. Nothing. It seems Mr. Meyers' word is as good as always. Oh, I wouldn't be so sure of that. It worked, Detective. Mr. Tesla, the direction. Uh, due east. Call box six, south by southwest. Sir, call box three is reporting west by northwest. Call box seven is reporting north by northwest. Northwest. George, is there a Pendrick building at this location? There is, sir. It's a livery. Once inside, we take no chances, understood? Meyers. Thank you for leading me here, Detective. Once again, you did not disappoint. I'll be taking it from here, Inspector. Not bloody likely, Meyers. This is a matter of national security, Inspector. Surely your fealty to your adopted dominion is not at issue here. - Fealty? - Devotion. That's codswallop, and you know it. That weapon is far too dangerous for any nation to possess. Better us than them, Murdoch, no? And don't be so naïve as to think the Canadian government would destroy such an advanced piece of technology and burn all the blueprints. Well, gentlemen, I don't think any of you will be laying claim to the contraption. The bloody thing's not here. Impossible. Even miniaturized, it would be sizable. There's no way they could have moved it that quickly. Actually, sirs, I think we have a bigger problem. I believe the death ray is about to fire again. My apologies, gentlemen. I fear I've led you into a trap. - Aah! - Oh! Aah! The bloody water nearly scalded me. The bloody water saved our lives. Clever deduction, Detective Murdoch. - An educated guess. - But where is the weapon? Gentlemen, I've come to the conclusion that the weapon must be mobile, mounted to a vehicle of some sort. A very large vehicle, I expect. And aside from water tanks, how do we defend ourselves against it? I would be happy to turn my attention towards developing a defense. That would be appreciated, Mr. Tesla. In the meantime, I believe another conversation with Mr. Pendrick is in order. Where's my hat? The device was fired again, wasn't it? How would you know that, Mr. Pendrick, unless you were directly involved? I've been monitoring events since our last discussion. A compass? A crude one. I didn't realize it was so difficult to scavenge a straight pin. Clearly you know more than you're saying, Mr. Pendrick. I watch and I listen, Detective. That and a basic knowledge of electrodynamics led me to realize what you were doing. Perhaps you've also deduced that I know the weapon was fired from one of your buildings. It's impossible. It's a fact. Let me out, Murdoch. I can help you. You want to help me? Then tell me where the weapon is. We know it's been mounted to one of your heavy-duty vehicles. I keep telling you, Murdoch. You've got the wrong man. You've got the wrong man, Murdoch. Murdoch! Murdoch! I doubt Mr. Pendrick will be of any further use to us. You're saying he's not a party to this? No, I simply mean he's unlikely to confess no matter how I approach him. Well, we'll send him back to Don Jail, and good riddance. Yes, sir. How goes it, Mr. Tesla? Quite well, I think. I have been musing over the death ray. Since Karnaki seems to have devised a technique to calibrate the ray's focal point, I believe the best defense mechanism may be some sort of shield. Sounds intriguing. Ingenious, actually. But I am only one man. I will need a constable to assist me. Scientifically minded, of course. Would youthful enthusiasm suffice? I suppose it will have to do. Very good. William, I just heard what happened. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. You've been avoiding me. No, no, I haven't. But I do have to go. We could ride together. I could drop you around to your house. I would like that. Wonderful. It was no one thing. A cumulative effect, perhaps. The realization that I only ever work on dead people. My hands heal no one. But why not simply apply at a hospital here in Toronto? Why go all the way to Buffalo? Because no one is offering me anything here. That could change. Do you really believe that, William? Whoa. We're here. How odd. My badge must have become magnetized when the magnetic field was distorted. Be careful, William. This is an unexpected surprise, Detective. I'm terribly sorry to intrude on your privacy like this. If you would just tell me what you're looking for, I'm sure I could help. We believe your husband has mounted the weapon on top of a vehicle of some sort. I'm hoping to learn anything I can about it. He must have kept plans, blueprints of some kind. I'm afraid I've never seen anything like that. I can't believe I was married to such a man. I'm so indebted to you, Detective. You owe me nothing. I owe you everything. This one's locked. Any idea what's in there? I'm afraid not. I've never opened it. No keyhole. I wonder if... Blueprints. James considered himself to be some sort of engineer. He was always coming up with silly little contraptions. There's nothing silly about this one. May I take this? Of course. Mr. Tesla?! Mr. Tesla, what on earth? Well, I forgot to mention that the microwaves are reflected by metal. Sir, Mr. Tesla believes that these holes will scatter the incoming energy yet still allow us to see through. Your constable has been an eager student. Sirs, I think if this sort of energy could be harnessed safely, you could cook a potato in minutes. Yams would be delicious. Yes, but such a machine would be the size of a small room. Yes, George. Highly impractical. Yes, sirs, but perhaps the future will allow for every home to have a potato-cooking room. Mr. Tesla, I have something to show you. Oh, how wonderful. The undercarriage alone would be extraordinary. Yes. I found this in Mr. Pendrick's study. I believe this vehicle was built to carry the weapon. Detective, this could definitely transport the microwave weapon. Mr. Tesla, do you think you could compile a list of materials required to build such a vehicle? - With pleasure. - Excellent. George, please follow through with that list. - Sir. Will do. - Sir. Ah, Henry, bring Mr. Pendrick back here immediately. Oh, that could be difficult, sir. James Pendrick just escaped while being transported - back to Don Jail. - What? He used a pin, sir, to pick the lock on his handcuffs. He overcame his escort. No doubt on his way to rendezvous with Karnaki. Henry, begin a search for Mr. Pendrick immediately. Right away, sir. And you? Mr. Pendrick already tried to kill his wife once. He may want to finish the job. Hello? Mrs. Pendrick? Mrs. Pendrick? Sally? Hello, Detective. It seems we're looking for the same thing. Mr. Pendrick, what have you done with your wife? I don't know how many times I have to tell you, Murdoch. I would never hurt anyone without provocation, least of all my wife. Then why are you aiming a gun at me? Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I am a fugitive, you're a police officer, and I'll be hanged if you bring me in. I meant if you are innocent of your crimes, as you claim, this is no way to convince me. It'll do for now. I came home one last time to try to convince her of my innocence before I ran for good. But I found the house empty, my staff gone, and no sign of her. I half thought I might find her with you by now. Mr. Pendrick, I can assure you, my heart is with someone else. But like you, I find your wife's absence disturbing. Perhaps she's in some kind of trouble. Holding a gun on me isn't going to help her. I'm a fool. Mr. Pendrick, I want the truth. What is your involvement in this affair? Sally's purse. My badge must have become magnetized when the magnetic field was distorted. It's... magnetized. It would have had to have been exposed to an enormous electromagnetic source, like a... Microwave death ray. That's ridiculous. Sally would have had to have been near it when it was fired. She knew we were looking for it in a Pendrick building. Perhaps she set the trap. What? She wasn't involved. She couldn't be. Mr. Pendrick, your wife was with you when you met Mr. Tesla in New York, was she not? Of course. She could have easily come into contact with Karnaki then. What are you saying? If we had arrive just a moment earlier... Indeed. Was it just fortuitous timing that your wife survived the explosion? Or was she spared because she knew precisely when the bomb was to go off? And the pornographer? McTavish. He threatened to expose her past. Did she kill him and make it appear as though you wanted the two of them dead? And there's the art theft. For some time now, I've suspected a mastermind to be behind the art theft, someone with intimate knowledge of the evening's events, as well as the building itself. Your wife was privy to such information. And when you saved my life, you prevented Carducci from revealing Sally as the mastermind. Why would she do this? I don't know. But it would appear we've both fallen victim to an expert fraudster. All along, you were holding the wrong suspect? That is completely unacceptable, gentlemen. Worst of all, I have it on good authority that the weapon has been sold. I would have thought the Canadian government - would spend whatever necessary. - Well, they didn't. Huh. It is to be transported out of the city by sunrise. And, no, I do not know from where. Sally Pendrick the whole time. I don't know what to say, sir. Oh, there's no mystery to it, Murdoch. She used her feminine charms on you. You were blinkered, Murdoch. I find it difficult to accept. That's because your pride's been wounded. You never thought you'd meet anyone cagey enough to outfox you. Oh, cheer up, Murdoch. Women are a troubling species at the best of times. My guess is she's feeling very smug at this moment. You might have her right where you want her. Thank you, sir. Sir. Where are we, George? The city's being scoured for Mrs. Pendrick as we speak. But so far, no luck. She no doubt had plans to leave town the moment she sold the weapon. Have men guard the train station, the docks. Already posted, sir. And where is Mr. Tesla? He was last seen exiting with that shield, muttering about wavelengths. Oh, and, sir, we contacted the police in Albany as per your request. They seem to think that our Sally Pendrick may be their Sally Hubbard, a notorious fraudster south of the border. But what about her hometown of Montreal? There's no record of her ever having lived there, sir. - Of course not. - Who is she really? Sally never wanted to discuss her past. She said she'd done things she wasn't proud of, and I chose not to ask. I loved her that much. But now it seems I knew nothing about her. I've spoken with my bankers. My accounts have been emptied over the past six months, mostly since my incarceration. Six months ago... roughly when Mr. Tesla approached you about funding his experiments. Then shortly after that, the Rembrandt robbery occurred. What are you suggesting? Sally needed money to fund Mr. Karnaki's work. Secretly she had been stealing small amounts from you, but she needed more and didn't want to alert you. So she staged the art robbery? Yes, but when that went wrong, she still needed more money from you. And to do that, she needed me out of the way. Damn clever. Between the art robbery and this whole eugenics affair, I was predisposed to suspect you. Then when Mr. McTavish came back into her life, she saw it as the perfect opportunity to frame you. And I... was only too willing to assist. Leaving her free to finance her project. I am so sorry, Mr. Pendrick. For everything. It's not your fault, Detective. The question now is how to stop her. Indeed. I despise that I still love her. Even after everything? Yes. I always hoped to find somebody that shared my passion, someone that loved me in spite of my foibles. How tragic. I'd hoped I'd find you here. William, I didn't think I'd see you under the circumstances. Julia... nothing in this world means more to me than you. William... And I believed you'd felt the same for me. But I do. Then I simply don't understand. There must be something you're not telling me. Why are you leaving? Julia, please. I have to know. Very well. Ever since the kidnapping of the inspector's son, it's been clear to me how much you want a family. But my abortion... That means nothing to me. We've put it in the past. William, it left me sterile. I-I should have told you before now, but I... I was frightened of losing you... to something I couldn't control. And so I decided to assert control myself. By leaving? It's for the best. Isn't it? This way you can meet a woman who can give you the life you deserve. William, please say something. I d... I don't know what to say. Yes. Well, that says it all. - No. - Doesn't it? No. I... Sir. I think we have something. Yes, George. I have to go. Yes. Isn't this is the address of the old tannery? Yes, sir. Abandoned now, I believe. But nearly everything on Mr. Tesla's list was delivered to that address within the last few months. I should have realized, George. If Mr. Pendrick was behind this, he never would have used one of his own buildings. This must be where they housed the weapon. Oh. What have we here? Detective Murdoch. A silver-coated aluminum shield. The silver's heavy concentration of electrons is highly reflective of microwaves, you see. Mr. Tesla believes that this will repel the death ray. Mm-hmm. Very good. There's no time to waste. Sir, I should come with you. Thank you, George, but it's far too dangerous, especially since I almost got you, the inspector, and Mr. Tesla killed last time. Yes, but, sir... Constable, no. Well, take this. Good thinking, George. Sir, what about the horse? He has no shield. I'll take care of it. Good luck, Detective. I am confident the windscreen will work... in theory. Giddap. We can't let him go alone. Mr. Tesla, stay here. I'll fetch the inspector. Come on. Move it! We're due at the dock. It is ready, Mrs. Pendrick. You two, you've been paid. What are you standing around for? Lock it up, Karnaki. Our friends from Istanbul won't wait. Yes, Mrs. Pendrick. And, Karnaki, never call me that name again. Would you prefer Sally Hubbard? Detective Murdoch. Both of you, down. Such a fuss over a silly gun. Why build this abomination? You were surrounded by so much wealth. The challenge, William. We all need something to live for, don't we? For you, it used to be a certain pathologist. Now it could be me. So, everything was a deception? Mr. Pendrick. Sally, was there no truth to our marriage? To the life we built together? James, this isn't a good time. Mr. Pendrick, I urge you to step back. But I loved you. I would have given you everything. I did give you everything. Doesn't that mean something to you? No. Oh! Mr. Pendrick! Hyah! I'm fine, Murdoch. Go stop her! Ah! Hyah! Hyah! Giddap, Sunny! Hyah! Giddap! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! - He's gaining on us! - Kill him! Aaah! What a god-awful mess. Destroyed beyond all use, sir. - Shame, isn't it, Mr. Meyers? - Well, it is, sir. I'll never figure out how those yams will turn out. Well done, Detective. What's all this, Meyers? I thought you'd be in tears. Inspector, believe it or not, there are things that even I believe shouldn't exist. Excuse me, gentlemen. Of course, if Mr. Tesla here were to help us build another one... - Go, Crabtree. - No problem, sir. This has been a trying day. I'm afraid it's not over yet. Now what? We pulled Mr. Karnaki's body from the wreckage, but I'm afraid your wife's was nowhere to be found. She escaped. She is surprisingly resourceful. She no doubt had a contingency plan. What will you do? I have nothing left. I'm free to start over. But on what? Well, we'll see what catches my fancy. I'm trust our paths will cross again, Detective. I look forward to it, Mr. Pendrick. Julia. William. As long as you exist in this world, there will be no other woman for me. Oh, William, I know, but... We can adopt. So many children need a good home. All I need is you. Julia Ogden, will you marry me? Well, yes! Yes, of course I'll marry you. It's beautiful. It's beautiful! Julia? She's gone to the train. And who are you? No. Julia!
