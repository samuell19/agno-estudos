Ladies and gentlemen, I present Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Barkingburg! Thank you all for coming to my party. Earl, please announce my special friends. First up, the lovable, adorable, positively regal Royal Kittens! Henry and Elizabeth. Kittens before me?! The Royal Pup, Sweetie. That's more like it. People of Barkingburg... Ryder! And the PAW Patrol! Hey, I think they like us! Yeah, I can really feel the love. Buzby! They're cheering louder for the PAW Patrol than they did for me.

We'll give it to you after the party. I can't wait! I love surprises! Hello, Barkingburg! I hope I'm not too late for the party! Would you please announce me? I'm... The Duke of Flappington! What? The Duke of Flappington? Where's that? I've never heard of it. Hm, I didn't see his name on the invitation list. Happy Birthday, cousin! I didn't know I had a cousin. Yes, Your Highness. He's from a distant branch of the family. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, cousin, Duke of Yappington! That's Flappington. It's just a short flight away. Zoom!

Because it's only given to the future king or queen... When they reach the age of ten! Is how these royal customs usually go. Buzby, if I had that gem, I'd be the future queen!
