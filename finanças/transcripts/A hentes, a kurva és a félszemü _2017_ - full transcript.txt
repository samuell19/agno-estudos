Based On A True Story The Butcher, the Whore and the One-Eyed Man Hungary lost the war in 1918... and the years that followed saw a nation disillusioned, hungry and impoverished. Tens of thousands of soldiers formed extreme groups and tried to maintain a state of war but to no avail. Their rebellion was quashed, they were forced to rejoin into society. Harder! Thank you! Here! You don't deserve it! - What are you doing? - What the hell are you doing? Get your arse back up there, now! Let me go, please! Get back to work! You've got two gents waiting. Just let me leave! I'm begging you! - I told you to go back up! - You sour, old bitch! Give me the money! No, I won't, it's mine! Give it here! It's mine! It's my money! It's my fucking money! I never want to see you again! Understand? Drop dead! The authorities are pursuing the Jew- and communist-killing gendarme lieutenant for his devilish acts. The dark past of Lieutenant GUSTAV LEDERER is slowly coming to light and we find ourselves faced with a truly evil individual. Gustav Lederer Lieutenant Gustav Lederer. Give it back! What, sir? That there. The medal. Give it back, now! And your gun. I for one am happy that the Jewish commie newspapers are publishing pictures like this. Let the dogs be scared! But you... you're done for! There's a warrant for your arrest. Can you actually read? So you are an illiterate. Do I get my service pay? You get fuck all! I hear you've got debts. 100,000 koronas. You know what? Keep it! And shoot yourself! Hear the trumpet call, come forward one and all... Jump up and grab your gun... Bastard! Who told you to pull me out of the way?! You rotten bastard! Oh, heavens above! You're beautiful! Come on! Come on! Two schnapps! - Cheers! - Thank you! 5 koronas. What are you doing here? You owe me, Kudelka! You owe me a lot from the war. Your eye! The commies shot it out. So they retired you off? There's a warrant out for me. They want to hang me. 75,000. Pay it back or I kill you! You got the lot in cash! I was left with a tonne of rotting meat! You're lying! Hand it over and we're gone. Pretty wife. She's mine. Introduce me. Ferenc Kudelka. Now what? Have you got work, Lederer? Nothing. I'll give you work. You'll get good pay. You were a soldier, right? You learned to kill, too, right? Come on! - Then we'll leave this place! - And go where? Anywhere. There's a warrant out for me. Right between the eyes! Doxa Parisienne. You'll never have anything like it. You're a rich man now. God's been good to you, Fatty Bacon! Don't call me Fatty Bacon! I provide meat... to the whole county. The big counties are mine. They're all mine. Half of Hungary eat my beef. You owe me. The last meat transport was worth hundreds of thousands. You got your money in cash, Lederer! Twenty percent! You left me with rotting meat! You sold it all! Don't lie, Fatty Bacon! Don't fucking call me Fatty Bacon! Listen... I'm a respectable man now. Times are hard. If you've got dollars, I'll change them. And you'll make a profit. I've got nothing... Just the woman. She's a real bit of class. How did you get such fresh meat? She's mine. 75,000. That's how much you owe. If you don't hand it over, I'll kill you! I've hard worked for all of this. I've worked hard, too. You still never made anything of yourself. At least I didn't steal from anybody. But at least I didn't hang anybody. Dismissed! Aren't you bored here? Oh, I am! I'm bored to death. Is your husband enjoying his new job? What's he done to hurt you? Hand over the 75,000... and you'll never see us again. Where would you go? Who needs a retired gendarme? There's warrant for his arrest! Just leave me be! You going to let me in or not? I don't bite. Don't play hard to get! I've found you a job. Like the one you found for Gustav? I had a word with Widow Schmuck. She'll give you work in her pub. At least you won't be bored! Bless us, Oh Lord, and these gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ, Our Lord. Amen. Kudelka's offered me a job. In the pub. Are you going to say something? What are you looking at? Staring at me with your one eye! What's going on in your head? You're a whore! You just can't stop yourself. All this standing is killing my feet. Pour me a glass. And one for yourself. Thanks. What kind of man is your Kudelka? He's the king around here. He pays everything. He owns everything. Including you? Fill the glasses. All of them! Calm down, gentlemen! You'll all get one... Shoo! Get out of here! I sent you fresh bed linen. Did you get it? Pots and pans... so you can cook for your husband. - Who told you that? - What? That he's my husband... What do you want from me? Haven't you got anyone and that's why you rot here? There was someone. A girl. Your sweetheart? She's dead. She killed herself. Your fucking Gustav knew her well! But you. You're completely different. Different... Your eyes... are as black as... a deep well... or a tall chimney. Pour! What's that? A whore's tattoo. When will you visit me? Never! Of course you will! Everything's for sale. I'll buy you in the end! Take it home! You can make a good greasy stew! Don't hack at it! Hold it firm! Where the shin meets the thighbone! On the joint! Go on then, cut it! Use the cleaver! Your new woman... she's a fine specimen! Maria. I saw the rose on her wrist, Lederer. She's mine! And you owe me 75,000. Give her to me for one night! I'll pay you, let's say... 10,000 koronas. You'll never have her! Learn how to cut meat, Lederer, otherwise you and your whore can both go to hell! I'm getting too old for this job. But you... I'd sell the place to you. Buy it! What? The pub. You'd sell it to me? How much would you pay? 75,000 koronas. 100,000... minimum. Glasses, beer tap, chairs, tables... Everything's included in the price. 100,000? You'll never have that much money. I Will. Where from? None of your business! What are you doing here, Fatty Bacon? I've got a proposal for you, Lederer. Like I said... 75,000 koronas. That's what you owe. Sell me your woman. I'll buy her for 75,000. She's mine. 100,000! I'll double the 75,000. I'll give you 150,000 for her! She's mine! What do you want? You. If you get your money... and you take me away from here... you can have me. Are you a virgin, or what? Good morning, gentlemen! Good morning! Let's get to work! - Good morning, gents! - Good morning, sir! Good morning, sir! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Morning, Lederer! What do you want, Fatty Bacon? I'm not Fatty Bacon to you! Cut me a piece of meat! Gustav's at work. Go away! Cook this! Kudelka found you a good job. It's suits you. You should check on your woman... Gustav Lederer. If only you knew... what she and the boss do in the pub... while you slave away here. I'll cut your fucking tongue out! Don't play hard to get! Don't be scared! I just want to have you! Let me tell you something. Do you know the deal I've done with Gustav? Deal? What deal? He's selling you to me. He's selling you. He's selling me? You'll have to pay a lot, Kudelka. I'll pay. Pay me. How much? 75,000 koronas. Maria! You're the most beautiful of all women. 80,000 koronas... 100,000! Are you playing me? Fucking bitch! You want to play games?! Come here, come here! Don't fight back, I'll fuck you anyway! Pull it out! You hear me? Pull it out! I'll pay you a visit tomorrow. I'll be back... tomorrow! Bastard! What? Do you want to sell me to your friend? He treats me like a whore. Did he touch you? I stabbed him. With a knife? A knife. Is he alive? He's alive. How much would the pub cost? What? 100,000 koronas. We'll have it. We'll have it all. Everything! We'll cut it out of Fatty Bacon! Kiss me! Tell me you didn't sell me to him. I didn't. It's not such a big thing. What's not? To kill a man. Lederer! Lederer... 200,000 koronas! Closing time! Good night, gents! What do you want from me? Music! Come on! And schnapps! You tried to kill me. I've brought you a wedding present. Fucking thing! I'll take you to the Moulin Rouge. We'll drink champagne. And then... I'll marry you! Maria! Maria! You look exquisite in that fur. You going to a pig killing? Tomorrow. At 4 o'clock. You come and I'll go. And bring the money. There's a fine price on your head, Gustav! That brings the price down. I'm going to report you! 200,000. In 20 thousand notes. I'll never pay that much for her. I'll give you meat. 200,000! I'll give you enough for a whole year! 800 kilos of best beef! What do you say, Lederer?! You're playing with your life, Kudelka! Do you want the woman or not? You've fallen in love with her. I'm going to report her. She tried to kill me. You won't report her. Why not? Because then you'll never get her. We'll clean the mess up. As if nothing happened. We can always change our minds. You're already in this up to your neck. You stabbed him. Gustav? He's outside. Here's your money. So? Strip off! Have a drink first! I said strip! This is for you. Two weeks ago. It's already two weeks. You wanted to kill me, remember? No kissing! It's not included! Maria! I love you! What? I love you, Maria! I love you! Go from here! What? What? Go! Maria! Maria! Go! What's the trick? What's happening? Go! Get out of here! Wait! This way! Maria! I love you! I love you! I love you! Count it! That fat fucking pig! He fucked us! And now he's dead. We'll never get the money now! 200,000 koronas. Maybe he's still alive. Pull him out! Come on! Help me! Take his hand! Grab it! Pull! More! Ferenc! Wake up! Come on! Come on! Come on! We've got to go! Where would we go? They want to hang me! We've got to go! It's all your fault! I'm going nowhere without the money. You killed him, you animal! Quiet! Come on! "For unto you is born this day in the city of David, the Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you. Wrapped in swaddling clothes "and lying in a manger." And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field. Watching over their flock by night. The angel of the Lord came upon them. And the angel said unto them... "Fear not... for I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people." Born in a manger, born in a manger. Son of God! Son of God! He is the Saviour, the Holy Saviour! One true Lord! One true Lord! Came down from heaven... I know what happened! You tried to kill me again. Be grateful that we saved your pathetic life! You robbed me! You stole my money! What money? You didn't bring a penny! I didn't believe you! You tricked us! Then got drunk like a pig and fell in the water! We could hardly get you out! Without our help you would have drowned. I forgive you both for everything! I feel like I'm living under the ground with no one's love to warm me! Listen to me! I'll never let you go! How much more do I have to pay your fucking husband'?! Don't pay him! Pay me! 100,000 koronas! And then you can have me. Cognac! Napoleon cognac! Do you now Ferenc Kudelka? Yes. What kind of man is he? He's the boss around here. He owns everything. Including you? Where's the slaughterhouse? It's like the Middle Ages! The way you do things here. Blood and filth all over the place. People will always need meat. You've gone out of fashion, Kudelka. Then how should we kill them? According to the new regulations. Systematically. Effectively, on an industrial scale. Use the railways, modernize! Electroshock! Why so many workers? There are far too many. We won't even need half the number. But, what should I do with them? What should you do with them? Slaughter them! The Krupp Company will do the rest. I'll buy the whole operation. And I pay in gold. Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil... Amen! Chicago's the place to be. I'm going to take you to America. Tomorrow is Epiphany. Tomorrow we're reborn. Tomorrow evening... I shall have you. Then after that, anything can happen. Like I said everything's for sale. I'll pay your price. So shiny! You're beautiful, Maria! Beautiful! Do you remember? Like the night we met. Don't woo me! I'll never give you to anyone. Never! We're going to see this through. We're going to kill that pig. And the whole thing ends tonight. That wretched money! As we agreed.. Tonight we set the deal. We set the deal! We set all. She is mine! Maria, you're mine! To business! Dance! Boys! Come here, boys! Come, come! Stop! Stop! Stop! Quiet! Come here! Gather around! Don't be shy! Come on! I've got something to say to you. Hear, hear! Enough! So... I've sold the whole place! It belongs to someone else... down to the last meat hook! This is the beginning of a new era... modernization, conveyor belts, machines, poleaxes, electroshocks and... clean killing! Kudelka will change, too! I'm... getting on a boat. And I'm off to Chicago! America! Everything will run by the regulations. Systematically. Like the German said. That's the way to kill! Systematically! Electroshock, clean killing! Machines and bells and whistles! But I won't be here to see it. No! I'm... sailing away! You lot! You lot! What are you lot staring at?! You're all fired! All of you! You're all fired! All of you are fired! Fuck off home, the lot of you! Here's the money for your woman! Count it, dog! 300... 400... 450... 500. And that's 75,000! I've bought your woman! Now you're mine. I'll take you to Chicago. Gold. It's yours. All. It's all yours. Come! Come on! He promised things. Like what? To take me to America. To Chicago. Chicago? Why there? On 10th November 1925, the Hungarian Crown rejected the leniency plea entered by the former gendarme lieutenant, Gustav Lederer. The sentence for the bestial murder of Ferenc Kudelka remains in force. The court sentences Gustav Lederer to death by hanging on this day. Hangman, do your duty! Lederer was buried in an unmarked grave in November 1925. Maria Lederer was sentenced to 20 years in prison and freed in 1946. She sold flowers in her old age and died in 1972. She was buried in an unmarked grave.
