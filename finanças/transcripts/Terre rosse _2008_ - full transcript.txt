We've seen her with someone we don't like Bill says that he works at the Ministry With the fascists!

Trust her Hello Hello You're Luisa, the teacher who helps my mother at school, aren't you? You know mum... I'm glad that you respect her its difficult to trust anyone these days Fortunately, no-one here hangs out with fascists Do they? See you soon There are Germans after the bridge I came from there Shit! A German Salute the officer Yes, salute him Hello! He didn't realise, did he? He'll come back with the SS So better get out of here then? But if they come back and don't find us they'll take it out on the villagers So what do you want to do? Let's take him out, Bill. That'll wipe out any doubts Leave it Bill. I'll sort him out I'll empty a magazine into him Or two. What do you think? Yes, two's better Where shall I hit him, Bill? A few shots, but good ones, so his friends won't come If you don't do it now, he'll be too far away Yes, yes, okay Only in the back like this He'd do it, wouldn't he? How the hell do I know, Bill. That isn't the point He's gone Shit! He only asked for a cigarette Bill And we were about to kill him like a dog What are we turning into? What are we turning into, Bill? I can see that you're better Good, good! I'd love to know what you're thinking about Maybe you've got a family Who you miss Good! You don't understand me, do you? Well, If it's any consolation, I don't understand myself either I don't know... sometimes I think... ...That I want to complicate my life I even did when I was a child We had a cantankerous neighbour who my mother hated And I fell in love with his son We used to meet in secret at school. A clandestine romance at 8 years old after twenty years things haven't changed much I'm in love with a man who works with the fascists and I live with antifascists. I don't know I don't know where this relationship'll take me But, Vassilij, I know that I want to live it to the full Are they your children? You'll see them again, Vassilij, I'm sure you'll see them again A beautiful girl's coming this way Antonio, this is Luisa Pleased to meet you Umbertds told me a lot about you and I have to say he hasn't exaggerated - So, why don't we celebrate now? - I really must go - But you've just got here - Please, Umberto, I can't Come on, don't be shy - So, Rosolio for everyone - And for you Luisa? - No thanks, not for me - But a bit of rosolio won't hurt you Waitress, rosolio for three please! I'm sorry Luisa! Luisa! What's the matter with you? There was too much smoke in there - And I felt suffocated - but what must Antonio be thinking? Why don't you go back to him? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, perhaps I'm just a bit tired Come on, let's go to my place What'll we do? We'll go for a drive Stop! Put the guns down! Put the guns down! Christ! I said put the guns down! I said guns down, down The clothes! The clothes! Vassilij We're off Sit down for a minute - Shut your eyes - Why? Shut them! - No peeking! - No You can open them now What is it? I'm so frightened of losing you What's the matter Luisa? - Nothing can happen to us, Luisa - Hold me, Umberto, hold me - Hi Marcellina, Hi Mary - Hi! I know you were expecting us later But two Krauts lent us the motorbike. So why not take advantage of it? It was too valuable a jewel to leave in the hands of the Nazis So... ...are we sending our friend Vassilij to Switzerland or not? We've got a passport. ...but Marcellina's got some bad news. I'm afraid so They've seen fascists at Lends. They're keeping her under surveillance Bugger! She could have helped you on the train - I'll go all the same - No, ifs too dangerous Okay It'd be better to put off the journey at least until we can get someone to go with you And him? I can't keep him at my mother's I thought he could maybe stay with you for a few days - And how should I talk to him? In dialect? - No, you just need to feed him In a few days we'll take you to Switzerland and you'll be free Never say I don't think of you - What are friends for? - Doesn't your teacher have a friend? You owe me one! The big cheeses are coming after the mess the partisans made outside the prison and then these idiots are going on with their provocations You know what I say! Better to get drunk! - And who's paying? - Do you need to ask? - Umbe', hold me back or I'll knock her down - You'd need a ladder to look her in the eye It isn't time for lessons Don't worry, I'll go away immediately Worry? My mother says yours a good teacher and... ...I have to trust you I don't smoke I'm going To the Ministry? Ok, I met a man who works at the Ministry He works for the Social Republic But he isn't a fascist he does his job like lots of other people He doesn't use a gun or wear a uniform He minds his own business If everyone had done that... Look, I admire you I know you risk your lives every day and I'm truly convinced that you're in the right but you can't think that whoever isn't with you is necessarily against you Because then everyone out there would be fascists. But it isn't like that! If you believe in what we're doing, how can you trust him? You know that I've already seen a gun like that? Yes, in a barn near here Umberto was there too. He saw everything He could have gone to the police, but he didn't and you know what risks someone runs when they don't report something like that Loving's dangerous in wartime if you love someone on the other side - But Umberto isn't on the other side - And you? I'd die sooner than betray you Prove it! What? Ifs to do with Vassilij We've decided to take him to a neutral country we've already done it to save Jews or other foreign soldiers Usually two of our agents go with them But unfortunately one of them can't go anywhere at the moment - But I don't believe that I can - There isn't much to do a train journey and then whatever you find to Switzerland So? When... when do we leave? As soon as we've made contact with the mountain guides If you have to separate for any reason, you'll meet up again in a prearranged place However, Mary, the other agent, will explain everything to you - So, I'll wait to hear from you - Yes You told me you didn't smoke Sit down. Papers! Reason for your journey? - Now, you must run without stopping. - Yes, yes. Think only about running I... Thank you, thank you! Thank you! Children! Children! Yes, Vassiiij, your children are waiting for you Thank you Guess what? - Umberto? - First, a drop of coffee You're playing hard to get - So? - First, the coffee - Here's your coffee - Thanks Mum Come on Eleonora, Is it from Umberto or not? Yes, it's from my little brother. Let's hope he's got his head together My dears, if everything goes as planned, you'll see me again soon So make up my room and have the piano tuned Mum please get me some jasmine perfume. Jasmine who knows if he'll ever get his head together But who's this... hi! I couldn't wait You know I've been busy working at Farneda - It was wonderful - I've never seen you so excited Well, lots of things have happened Which have kept you away from class. I came to look for you but you weren't there Of course, because I was teaching the children who can't come to school Of course, because I was teaching the children who can't come to school - And you neglect me like that! - No You must be forgiven! Come here! - I've been invited to a party - A party? - Is it a party at German Headquarters? - Yes It's tomorrow evening. I can't. I've promised the teacher to help her. - And there's the curfew, isn't there? - I've got you a pass. No Umberto, really, I can't tomorrow. There'll be other opportunities. Really! Opportunities aren't enough for me, Luisa I want to have you with me forever This moment will come. We must just be patient. The Germans! The Germans! Please don't die. Look at me. Please Are you sure about what you're saying, Antonio? Lieutenant Berselli told me. He was with the Germans And someone was killed - A girl was killed by mistake - O Christ! They were looking for a straggler and that idiot started shooting everyone I have to see her Antonio, I have to be certain she's Ok Almighty and Eternal God, who reigns over the living and the dead receive the soul of our young sister, tragically dead receive the soul of our young sister, tragically dead Did you know her? It could have happened to you Luisa This place isn't safe anymore you don't realise what's happening, Luisa I don't realise? And you? What do you know about these people's pain? Please, Luisa, this isn't the right time. This isn't the right time? That girl... ...died in my arms And I... I still remember her eyes And you come to me to say that this isn't the right time? I'm being transferred to Como What, they're sending you to Como They're transferring the offices to Lombardy because it's safer You mustn't worry. I've already thought about you You only need follow me My father's got influence. He'll find you a place, you'll see. I can't follow you, Umberto I love you I love you But we're too different but how can you say that you love me and then not come after me What will you achieve by staying here? I don't know what I can do here, but I know that I must stay. How can I tell my children that I'm scared and I want to run away I can't run away, Umberto Not now Not now? So, when? Who knows when this war will end. And it'll get worse and worse here Why does Farneda and the school matter to you? They aren't part of you You're just passing through here Umberto, don't push it! You must never say this Okay. Okay. If you change your mind, you know where to find me We've got visitors found her down there in the wood. She says she wants to talk to you What do you want? I want to stay here What? - And what are we going to do with this one? - Kill him - If we let him go, he'll come back with his friends. - Don't talk rubbish He's always been blindfolded strip him and take him to a safe place Then let him go Hell, they don't do that to us! Did you see Giovanni? They killed him and dragged behind a truck And so? - Do you want us to descend to their level? - Aren't we at war? Do you want to become a murderer? - So what do you want me to do then? - Go ahead kill him. Shoot! Shoot! Do as he said. Take him away! You must also go away. Go back to Farneda. You'll be more useful to my mother Better not risk it. it'll be dark soon. You can go down tomorrow morning Okay but you'll come down there tomorrow You're right Love and war don't go together Is it over? He's been transferred to Como You can always write to each other Please, let me stay Luisa the teacher doesn't exist any more. She's dead Please, let me start again here Do you know what the life of one of us is worth? A kilo of salt That's the reward they give to anyone who captures one of us Do you think it's worth it? Your place is down there. Teaching the children to build a future. What future do you think we'll have if the war doesn't end? Please, Serse, I beg you Let me stay Here! I hope you'll never have to use it Welcome to the war! Dear Umberto, I ask you to read this letter to the end before you're tempted to tear it up, I'd like to ask for your forgiveness. Don't hate me, Umberto, for not following you. It'd have been easy to take the safe and easy way with you If I'd chosen love I'd have killed the part of myself which still believes in the redemption of the just, And in those who are fighting for a different world. Only God knows what I suffer But I've decided that I must live, not just exist! You won't have any more news of me But remember... That I loved you with all my heart And if you think of me at least once know that my love will follow your soul Forever! - So, see you tomorrow - Okay. Till tomorrow Let's go. Mum's expecting us What a shame. We could have had a walk by the lake What are they doing? Christ! You can't! Partisan whore! So To Renzo, who's spending another birthday at war Better here than in one of the Decima's prisons, eh? Hey! Why are you celebrating with that muck? Look at this. From the fascists' cellars. War booty! Fantastic news. Long live Sergio! Well done lads However, before going on with the party, I want to tell you the latest news The radio of Chilesotti HQ says that the Germans have had the wind put up them the American 5th Army's a few kilometers from Comacchio and in a few weeks' time it should have reached our positions - they'll continue the air drops - But when? You'll be told in time Hey, shall we try the wine the fascists gave us? Why are you so late? The Germans are taking away lots of people. it's terrible The usual thing, dear Nora The poor people always pay While those criminal communists in the mountains get away with it They're like their chief, Badoglio He ran away with the King and now they're in hiding, waiting for the end of the war Cowards! Badoglio's a coward But Mussolini Do you believe that the man who dragged us into this war isn't guilty? At least, he didn't betray anyone. He should have done! Staying on Hitler's side isn't consistency, Dad... it's foolishness And now, excuse me, but I've lost my appetite Umberto, this isn't the way... You forgot this What's happened to you, Umberto? You've been impossible since you got back. Especially with Dad There's a woman at the heart of this, isn't there? The one who was supposed to follow you the jasmine, the room to get ready Do you know what I think? 'Rf she didn't follow you, she didn't deserve you 'If there's anyone who doesn't deserve to be loved, ifs me I didn't understand her at all I abandoned her right in the most difficult moment You did what you thought was right Yes, perhaps But now I think differently So why don't you write and tell her? A letter of apology isn't enough What are you going to do? I love you Nora! Never forget that, Spring 1945 This is a Sten. it's got 30 shots You load it like this, point it in that direction and then shoot Not like that. You're shooting the pigeons! - Where did you get that? - I gave myself a little present it's a bit tight for you How are you getting on with the new ones? Apart from a few dead pigeons... They need to learn quickly I've been talking to Mary - The Krauts want to move up onto the plateau. - Big stuff? It'd seem so We need more people and something heavier We're ready When you see the Germans at the bottom of the road, on the bend, get on the bike. That'll be the signal And then you get out of there And don't stop for any reason! Okay Good Luck And to you Stop Bugger! The car's stopped I'll keep it on target Umberto I can't go on... ...I can't imagine my life without you Bloody hell. Let's hope they'll at least get off the road Umberto, the Germans! Come here this way! Don't shoot until the first charge and keep your bloody head down if you want to take it home - Please, Umberto, run - No, I want to be with you! We must get out of here On my signal, we'll move towards the wood Go, go This way, this way Umberto Umberto Bastards! Umberto Umberto Where's Umberto? Where is he? I don't know where Umberto is. I don't know Where are the others? This is a bloody awful war, Luisa. It's our duty to hope But I can't take it any more So, you've really decided to leave us You can't stay clinging to memories You have to let go and I'm planning to start studying again You'll be a good teacher - We'll miss you so much! - And I'll miss you Kiss the children for me Why don't you say goodbye to them yourself? Children! They want to give you their exercise books so that you'll remember them. Umberto died on a spring day Only a footstep from the end of the war I was told that before he died He saved one of ours I never came back to the Red Lands A lot of the certainties I had at 20 stayed there and I've never found them again But this is part of the life that we are called to live.
