A Kitty Films Production Here. Over here! Come on, over here. Wait! Wait for me! There! I got it! What?! Did you really? Yeah, really. I'm not lying. On my planet, stepping on someone's shadow is a marriage proposal. I'm not really from this planet. Now you'll have to marry me. Is that all right with you? Yeah. That's fine with me. I'll be back in 11 years to pick you up. Wait for me until then, O. K? In 11 years, I'll be 17 years old. That's a long time... Let me see, Mendou Shutaro... Mail call! Messenger! Mail for the young master! Hurry! Bring the motorcycle around! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Notify all checkpoints! Messenger will deliver mail addressed to the young master. Estimated time of arrival is just before sunset. That is all! Young Master! Mail for you, Young Master. Read it. Read it. Huh? But... I don't care. I don't care. Yes, sir. "We cordially invite you to attend the ceremony..." "...of the binding together of our love..." "...of the binding together of our love..." A wedding invitation. Rubbish. This letter is signed by Moroboshi Ataru and "Elle." Eh? What! What did you say?! Young Master! Calm down! Please calm down! Moroboshi is getting married? That Moroboshi? Ridiculous. I don't know who made this up, but it's a rotten joke. No, but... contact the chief of the intelligence bureau. Now! Yes, sir! I doubt this wedding story is true. If it is, though, then Lum's unhappiness is assured. When that happens, I will personally... ...cut that bastard Moroboshi in half! URUSEl YATSURA URUSEl YATSURA ONLY YOU Even though I, I, I, I love you... Executive Producer Taga Hidenori Even though I, I, I, I love you... Even though I, I, I, I love you... ...why are you, you, you, you always gloomy? I, I, I, I, have strong feelings of missing you. You, You, You, You, I will seduce, for sure. The world begins with you and I. A woman is no good if she's tired of waiting. A woman is no good if she's tired of waiting. Love me, flirtatious Darling. Hold me, bashful Darling. Kiss me, wonderful Darling. I'll always be ready to be in love with you. Even though I, I, I, I love you... ...why are you, you, you, you always gloomy? Hey, did you hear? Hey, did you hear? Yeah, I heard. I heard. Yeah, I heard. I heard. About Ataru getting married? Yeah, I heard. I heard. About Ataru getting married? About Ataru getting married? Married? That Ataru? I heard Mendou, Shinobu, and Megane got invitations, among others. Even so, aren't Ataru and Lum a couple? Why now? I hear he's not marrying Lum! What?! You gotta be kidding! You gotta be kidding! Then who is it? Then who is it? Is it Shinobu? Then who is it? Is it Shinobu? Is it Shinobu? Can't be. Can't be. Not now. Can't be. Not now. Not now. Could it be Miss Sakura? Could it be Miss Sakura? I ought to hit you. Could it be Miss Sakura? The invitation was from Moroboshi Ataru and "Elle." Elle? Elle? Is that a name? Is that a name? It must be a girl. Is that a name? Do you think that Ataru would marry a dog? But wouldn't that be bigamy? What's that? Is that some sort of sexual perversion? Lum probably doesn't know about this. Obviously. If she did, there'd be thunder and lightning by now. Don't you think someone should tell her? Could you tell Lum that to her face? I feel sorry for Lum. She knows nothing about this. Still, Ataru sure has some nerve. He won't get off easy. There's a rumor that Megane will seek the death sentence for Ataru... ...at a secret tribunal of the Stormtroopers. I thought so. Still, the main contender is probably Mendou. It's strange that he hasn't come to school for the past two days! In any case, this will mean... Yes, it's a matter of time before Tomobiki High is drenched in a rain of blood. But, you know... Eh? What? Exactly who is this "Elle?" Hmmmm, "Elle?" "Elle?" Ouch! "A real cutie wants to see you." "Come to the rear of the clock tower when class is over." "Keep this a secret from Lum. - Megane." "The defendant's present action of planning bigamy..." "...has taxed our patience beyond its limits." "This is a grave offense that we simply cannot tolerate." "By Heaven, Earth, and Man, this atrocity is unforgivable." "Thus, we, the Executive Council of Lum's Stormtroopers..." "...have come to the conclusion..." "...that it is our sacred duty and right to punish the defendant, as well as..." "...to find out the full truth." Agreed! We will now start the interrogation. Defendant Moroboshi Ataru! Y... You guys really think you'll get away with doing this to me? Shut up! We will go to any lengths to ensure Lum's happiness. I did promise to introduce you to a cutie, right, Ataru? It is someone I think you also know well. The mere mention of his name will quiet a crying child. A representative of the... ...Tomobiki High School Torture Research Club... ...weighing 350.5 pounds... our comrade, Sadoyama! S... Stop! Stop it! I will begin with "Special Technique #1," which will impart hellish convulsions. What do you say, Ataru? We don't like violence either. Start talking and make it easy on yourself. Eh? I'm telling you I don't know! I'm innocent! I've never met a girl named Elle! You don't know her? You're innocent? Never met her? Continue the torture! Stop! Stop it! I... l'm innocent! This is... a plot, or someone's idea of a practical joke... Oh? I see, "a practical joke..." Shut up! Ataru, do you know why we had a gentleman's agreement? Why, all this time, we have borne the unbearable... ...and been only Stormtroopers? It was all for Lum's sake... for the sake of her happiness. It's because I painfully understand the fact that Lum is totally smitten with you. I... l, too, wanted to get to know Lum, for real. I wanted to clasp her to my bosom. How many sleepless nights have I spent envying you... Megane... I don't want pity! Not from you! You... You have trampled our feelings under your dirty feet! Ataru, don't you see?! This time it's different! We don't mind taking a back seat provided Lum is happy. So please tell us. Who is this Elle? I'm sorry. I really don't know. Continue the torture. Stop it! Next will be the three-stage electric massage treatment. Stop it! Stop it! I... l'll die! Ataru... Shinobu! It's Shinobu, isn't it! Save me, Shinobu! You're the only one who understands, right? It's the same as the last time... When Lum first came to Earth, you said I was the only one. Then you cried to me when you got messed up for being flirtatious. You haven't changed at all, Ataru. I just can't accept this. Who is this Elle?!? H... H... H... Help! Save me! Save me! Somebody save me! Lum! Lum! Lum! Lum, I was so scared. Megane and Shinobu have been picking on me. Darling. Darling... ...who is Elle? Exactly WHO is this Elle? H... how did you find out about that? When this arrived a moment ago, I brought it to Lum's attention right away, Ataru! Mailing this to Lum is pretty daring... ...or else just plain stupid. That must be it. Darling... who is this Elle? Just what is the meaning of this? You'd better have a very good explanation! Darling! Ataru! Geddouta here! Go away, Ataru! C'mon now. Aren't we friends? Let go! I have no desire to commit lover's suicide with you! I believed in you. I thought you truly loved me in the deepest corner of your heart. O... Of course. I think only of you all the time. So really now... Darling, you... ...IDIOT! What the? What the? What was that? Hey... over there... It's Mendou! It's Mendou's mobile armor division! Finally, Mendou has acted! Things are getting interesting. Young Master, the troops have reached their attack positions. Your orders? All troops, standby. But, sir... I need no help. I, Mendou Shutaro... will settle this score like a man. I will personally cut Moroboshi in two! Y... Young Master! Moroboshi! Now you tell me, Darling! Who is Elle?! I don't know. I really don't know. Moroboshi! Not only have you been unfaithful to Miss Lum... ...countless times in the past... ...but your barbarous actions this time are like a crown of thorns... ...upon the head of this beautiful, unhappy girl! My patience is at an end! Hold still while I put you to the sword! I won't forgive you if you try to harm Darling! Miss Lum! After you have been trampled on this much, you still... This is between husband and wife. Butt out! That's no sign of repentance! Sir! Radios are unusable on any frequency! A magnetic field of incredible power is manifesting! What?! All students on the grounds, return to the school building immediately! Return to the school building immediately! All students on the grounds, return to the school building immediately! All hands, battle stations! Lum, where is that spaceship from? It's a type I've never seen before either. Look! Someone's coming out! It's coming this way! Moroboshi Ataru. I've come from Planet Elle to pick you up. Come this way. Planet Elle? Does that mean she is Elle? Darling! Hey, you! Don't you seduce my Darling! Who are you? I'm Darling's wife! That's what SHE thinks! What are you trying to do, coming between a married couple?! Ha! I don't know about any "couple..." ...but the fact is, he got engaged eleven years ago. I won't let you interfere. "Engaged eleven years ago?!" Darling! Is that true? Ah, looks that way, after all. The shame of it! To find out that you've been having an affair for eleven years! Miss Lum, please calm down. Relax... Shut up! I'm coming! Huh? Hey! Wait! Darling! Darling! Wait! Hello there! Ahoy! I haven't seen you for 11 years now. Really, I'm glad to see you again. But... As I stand in front of you, I fondly recall the time when we were together. Right, Elle? I am not Lady Elle. She's the captain of this spaceship. Ah, that person there... is she? Yes, this is Lady Elle... No way! I refuse! This is perverted. At your age you should be ashamed. Now, why don't you go home and take care of your grandchildren? Bye! I am Lady Elle's nanny, Babara. All her life, I have nursed and protected her. I should add that the Captain's beauty does not compare with Lady Elle's. Oh, long time no see. In good health, it seems. You've put on a lot of wrinkles. You must have really been through a lot. Bah. This is the first time we've met. That's right. That's right. It's been so long now. You got me. You got me. Well, it's OK. It was indeed a long time ago. As Lady Elle's representative, I am here to pick you up. However, it appears the bridegroom has some unfinished business... ...to take care of, so how about if I come back tomorrow? Oh, that's cutting it close. We'll meet again here. See you then. Right. Hey, Darling! And that woman and old hag, too! Oh, you're still here? Take this! That level of lightning won't even scratch us. Before the wedding, the well-being of the bridegroom is essential. So I have sealed him within a powerful barrier so no one can harm him. Until tomorrow, then. Bye now... Darling! Darling, are you really serious about this? Are you really going to trust that strange old woman and go to Planet Elle? That lady captain is quite a beaut. If my fiance is even better, then... heh, heh. Darling... Darling, you idiot! Hey, Lum! Still in all, the universe really is vast. To think that someone existed who could compete with Lum's bad taste in men... Ten. Ten, I don't have any place to go now. The only place left is Darling's room. What should I do now, Ten? Looks like you've run out of places, Lum. Who said that? I'm disappointed that you forgot my voice. Hi there. Benten! Just a moment. Let's finish what needs to be finished right now. Over there! Benten! Didn't you realize you were being tailed? Boy, when someone is depressed, their senses sure are dulled, as well. Hey, you'd better explain why you were following her! Jeez, what a funky getaway. Lum, do you know what that was all about? You talk too much. Hurry up and leave! I see. So you and Oyuki received invitations as well? Yeah, it looks like they sent invitations to anyone with a connection. Even Kurama and tiny Kintaro knew about it. Really, those people have some nerve. I came here as a representative of every- one to see what the hell's going on. I see your husband hasn't changed a bit. Ah, could you pass that? I'm sorry everyone is so worried. Don't tell me you're going to sit still after being trampled like this? I'm very angry, but I don't know what to do. You're really irritating. In a fight, they say the first move wins, right?! "The first move wins?" As I was saying... Ah! ...you're being watched closely. Tonight is your only chance to act. When that old witch Babara comes back tomorrow, it'll be too late. All right. You just watch. I'm not going to let anyone take my Darling! Thanks, Benten. You're a true friend. OK, OK. Just get going. Take care of the tab, OK? Hey, wait! You forgot Jariten! She's finally become serious. But now things will be more interesting. I'm gonna use your phone, Pops. No long-distance calls. Mister, your dishes have lots of meat. Mister, your dishes have lots of meat. This is going to be very involved. This is going to be very involved. Yep, heaping helpings. And more. This is going to be very involved. Yep, heaping helpings. And more. Yep, heaping helpings. And more. Galaxy Rental Service? Send one interstellar microbus here immediately. With driver. There's a possibility of a shoot-out, so have it armed with a Maser. Eh? What? You idiot! Isn't that why you have insurance?! If you're in fear for your life, you shouldn't be in this business! Send the bill to Planet Elle, attention old lady Babara. All right? And throw in a dozen missiles free of charge. Bye! Ah, M... M... Miss... are you planning to start a war? What did you say? Nah, something more interesting than that. Eh? I want... a beef-bowl... ...extra large... ...with miso soup and pickled vegetables... Hi there, Rei. You're late. Too bad, you just missed Lum. Beef-bowl... Sorry, but I don't have the time to feed you beef-bowls. Here, change his diaper and call Lum's dad. ...extra-large... Don't just stand there! This is for the sake of your precious Lum! Go! Hurry up and go! Go right away! Go! Hurry up and go! Go right away! ...with miso soup and pickled vegetables! Get your mind out of the beef-bowl! Hey... th... they didn't pay! Darling! I'm coming! I really am getting fidgety! More than anyone else, I love you, love you, love you the best! To think that you're saying farewell to your parents... ...and to the Earth tonight because you're going to get married! Why did I have to go through the struggle of raising you? Dear! If you're his father, then say something fatherly to him! Ahem! Ataru! Yeah, what, Dad? You're still a high-school student. Just don't borrow money to finance your wedding and honeymoon. What the devil are you saying?! Now, Madam. Screaming like that is a waste of time. Shut up! And why are you eating in my house?! I see an ill omen in this proposed wedding. An incredibly ill omen. I came here because I feel I am the only one who can remedy this situation. Then say something to him! Hey, Ataru! I'm going to marry Elle. That's what he says... You worthless imbecile! Now, Ataru, Ataru... are you really going... ...to the planet where this girl Elle is staying? Yep. Yep. You're going to... ...abandon your mother, and go away just like that? Don't you care? A boy must someday break away from his mother. That is karma. No, no. You're my only child! Who... who will take care of me in my old age, when I'm all alone?! Darling! I'm here to pick you up! L... Lum! Whatever you say now won't make any difference. I'm going to Elle's planet and marry her. I'm all through with you! I'm not going to pay one damn cent in palimony, either! In fact, I should be the one getting paid! I don't need palimony, because you're coming to my planet... ...and we're going to get married. What did you say? Lum, now that I think about it, I feel sorry for you... ...because you fell in love with a guy like me. Have you forgotten? I'm totally protected from your lightning attack by this barrier's power. My will of steel cannot be changed by anyone. I'll take my time and change your mind later. Wha? S... Stop it, Lum! Stop! This is an "Uzushio" fully automatic suction device. As long as I don't use lightning, the barrier is ineffective. Mr. And Mrs. Moroboshi will also attend the wedding ceremony. You too, Cherry. Ah, no, I have to... Lum, how'd it go? Mission accomplished! All right. Once the wedding has been performed, it's a fait accompli. We're going to gather the rest of the guests. Step on it! Right. UFOs approaching from the north- northeast, altitude 200 meters! Speed Mach 10! Alert! Alert! UFOs approaching! Alert! Alert! UFOs approaching! Air alert, Young Master! Please evacuate to the air raid shelter! Hurry! What? The Mendou Air Defense Zone can't be breached that easily! Never mind! Shoot them down without delay! OK. On to the next one. Right. Here we go. Hurry, Benten! I know! We're gonna pick 'em up right now! Hey, driver... Make sure you fly the course I outlined earlier. Got it. One more to go. Man, what a drag. All right. Got some extras, but overall we got everyone we wanted. Listen up, everybody! Sorry to be so abrupt about this... ...but you're all invited to attend Lum and Ataru's wedding. In any case, thanks! You can't! This is crazy! All set, Lum. Now that we've got everyone, we're leaving Earth. OK. Dashing through the dreaming galaxy to our rendezvous. Chase a shooting star, and keep running until morning. Cosmic Cycler, cycling in the starry sky... Run Run Run Run... Runaway Home! Cosmic Cycler, wheeling in the starry sky... Run Run Run Run... Runaway Home! Cosmic Cycler, cycling in the starry sky... Run Run Run Run... Runaway Home! Cosmic Cycler, wheeling in the starry sky... Run Run Run Run... Runaway Home! Cosmic Cycler... Eh? Ahh! Five seconds to rendezvous point. Relative velocity: 0.004 parsecs. I must apologize for having to ask you to take us aboard. Bah. Normally, I wouldn't want to have to accept an invitation from an Oni, but... Hi there! Right on time. Long time no see, Oyuki. I'm really glad Kurama is coming, too. I didn't come to congratulate you. I came only to witness your marriage to Ataru... ...so that I can once and for all escape the awful fate of marrying him myself. Man, what a jerk. I just don't like her. Lum! B... Benten! Why'd you invite Ran?! Well, I'll be... I wonder who invited that airhead? You're so mean, Lum. If I hadn't asked Oyuki, I wouldn't have found out about your wedding. I don't like how you tried to keep this a secret from a childhood friend. Oh, woe! Oh, woe! I'm going to cry! It's too much to bear! HEY! ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?! Eh? So the boss of the beef-bowl has finally arrived. Rei! Where's Lum's dad? Barrier: Forcible removal complete! Barrier: Forcible removal complete! Darling! Darling, I'm so glad! If the barrier hadn't come off I would have been really worried. Come on. Our folks are waiting. Here we are! Finally finished? Sit here, Son-in-law. It's been a while. I haven't seen you since that matchmaking incident. In any case, let's have a drink. Ataru! We have been talking with Lum's parents and... ...oh, thanks... ...whatever the initial reason... ...you and Lum have been living together for more than a year. It's about time you tied the knot. Lum is too good of a girl for you. It isn't fair to keep her waiting. Be a man, and accept your responsibilities. Ataru, it may not matter to you because you're a boy... ...but girls want to be properly married. That's a woman's happiness. Do you understand? Besides, her parents are very nice people... ...and I've become good friends with her mother. They've even promised to give your father a job! [Skipped item nr. 493] Oh, really? ...and there are no Japanese-Oni dictionaries. . Oh, you're so good. Ataru, do you understand? Now, now. You don't have to push the boy. He knows what's right. Right, Son-in-law? Uh, yes... Wheeee! Son-in-law, make sure you take good care of my daughter! This is so romantic. Boy, what a mess I'm in! We've been through so much, but at last we're going to be properly married. Oh, I want to see Elle. Somehow, I've got to get out of here. I can almost hear footsteps of happiness. I can almost hear footsteps of doom. Somehow I have this feeling that we're not on the same wavelength. Huh? M... Must be your imagination. Oh, yes. I have something to give you. Here. These are Tiger Stars. On my planet, they say these stones connect lovers' hearts together. "Tiger Stars?" Darling, here. W... wait! If I wear that, isn't it like wearing an engagement ring?! It isn't like an engagement ring, it IS an engagement ring! N... No way! It's Elle I want to! Darling! Darling, are you still talking like that?! Wait! S... Stop! Darling! I'll give you a super-duper electric lynching if you try to take it off. OK! I... I get the message. Finally, we'll be together forever. Eh? What's this? What's the matter? There's some sort of distortion ahead of us, and it's getting larger. What is it? What's going on here? Boss, you'd better take a look at this. Huh? Reverse thrust! Full speed reverse! B... Boss, that's Planet Elle's fleet! What do we do? So that old bag was waiting here to ambush us. I didn't think she was going to let things go quietly. Man the weapons! If it's a war they want, we'll give 'em one! All hands, battle stations! All hands, battle stations! So the Oni-girl got her daddy to help... Fat lot of good it'll do her. All right. Phase One complete. Commence Phase Two. Contact the infiltrator aboard the enemy ship. Initiate operation immediately! Eh? Still one inside? Here, kitty, kitty... Meow... Meow... Listen, all of you! What ever the cost, you must protect my son-in-law! Show your fighting spirit! Onward, like a hundred-million fireballs! It's all-out war. Don't worry. My dad'll protect you. Lum! Don't you feel any responsibility for bringing about this situation? Don't you feel that we have to do something? Hey, Lum, it isn't too late. You must turn me over to them. But... Don't say another word. If my solitary sacrifice will avert this war, I... ...I will gladly offer myself up. Offer yourself up to whom?! Uh-oh. For glory and honor, lay down your young lives, gladly! I... I have given myself, body and soul, to you. Why won't you let me be responsible for your life? I'm responsible for the lives of each and every one of you! We're still husband and wife, even though it isn't formal! When we die, we'll die together! When we die, we'll die together! Big brother! Think of the circumstances. Romance is not all there is to life. Go! Die for the sake of love! Die for the sake of love! Is Elle really so special? Do you really want to go to her that badly? Why do you prefer a girl you've never even seen over me? Man. Why don't you understand? Lum, I... Nothing you say carries any conviction! I can't believe you! Is that so? In that case, so long... No! You can't leave me like this! Darling, you belong to me alone! Look only at me! Think only about me! Hey! Don't be so unreasonable! Lum, if you really love me, then why can't you accept the way I live? Eh? B... but... This is the end! Sorry, Darling. I'm going to store you in the safe until we reach my planet. Now you know the might of the ultrasonic hammer. Now, I'm going to borrow your face and body for a while. Lum... Lum... Where are you? Lum? Hands up! Come any closer and I'll shoot! How dare you point that gun at me! Hurry up and open that gate! Like hell! Who the devil are you?! Oh look! A UFO! What? Where? This is the 36th one so far! Hmmm, I don't get it. How come they can see through my perfect disguise? What is that thing? Hey, look at that fighter! All right, man! Real war is so intense! Oh yeah! So this is war! Hey, you guys! You're all so immoral! Are you really so happy about war breaking out?! A pun on the Japanese protest song, "Children Who Don't Know War." You bet we're happy! Now we're "Children who know war!" It's a rare opportunity! Miss Sakura! Oh! Ten! Oh, Shinobu. Where's Sakura? She just left with Cherry to eat. They say it's "all you can eat..." ...so I doubt they'll be back anytime soon. Nobody asked you! Oh, well, excuse ME! Ten, is something wrong? Oh, yeah. On the upper level... What was that? Hey! Who's flying that shuttle without authorization?! They finally noticed. Idiots... Oh, so you've come to, Bridegroom? What the! Where am I? And who are you? My name is Rose, the Woman of Seven Disguises. I work for Babara. It's a spy! A spy has kidnapped my son-in-law! Thank you! Thank you! I'm saved! There I was, in hell, and along comes an angel. I'm saved! Lum is so persistent, I really thought that my luck had run out. Still, you shouldn't give up hope. At the last moment, a savior comes along... ...and best of all, a pretty girl! Oh, you're so kind. That idiot. Now, let's go on to my rosy new life with Elle! Full speed ahead! Shame on you, Son-in-law! Stop that! Stop! H... Hey! The room is moving! What?! Darling, I won't let anyone take you away! Miss Lum, don't! That fighter is... This is Gate 2. Miss Lum has taken off in a high-speed interceptor! She shouldn't have done it! It was down for repairs! If she uses the afterburner, it'll explode! Lum! Lum! Lum! You mustn't go! Come back! Lum, Lum, that fighter is... Darling... Darling, I won't let anyone have you! Eh? We're being pursued. Give my Darling back! Give my Darling back! I... lt's Lum! Damn her! I've got the edge on you in speed! Lum! Whew. She managed to eject safely. Whew. She managed to eject safely. I guess you really do care for her. Ah, no, not really... Darling! Darling, don't go! Darling! Darling! Darling! A little right, right. Steady. Reverse thrust 40%. I ordered you to bring back just the groom. What's with these others?! Ah, well, it just happened. Babara is furious! You're in big trouble! Yes, Captain. We're tens of thousands of light-years from Earth. What will become of us? Who can say? In any case, we're stuck with following this idiot, even if he leads us to hell. Hey, Ataru. Ataru. Eh? What? Ataru, are you really planning to live on this planet from now on? Obviously. Ataru! W... What? Don't you miss Mother Earth? Our home? The Beef-bowl Restaurant in front of Tomobiki High School? The taste of the rice as the sauce seeped into it? Don't you miss that?! It looks like there's a Beef-bowl Restaurant here, too. Let's go eat there later on. Well... Well then, how about the noodle stand in front of the train station? The taste of fried tofu atop thick wheat noodles? How about the smell of the sauce of fried octopus balls? Eating our fill of them at the park where the kids were playing? And that ramen stand we went to after going to the public baths? Are there such places on this planet?! No, probably not... It's over! My wonderful life is over! Listen, Megane. There are men, and there are women. Life is pretty much the same, no matter what world you're on, right? Furthermore, I'm going to marry Elle, and become the king of this planet. The king. Do you know what that means? You don't mean... That's right. I will be the most powerful person on this planet. Everything on this planet will be mine, including ALL the women! I'm going to create... a harem! Debauchery! Debauchery as I've only dreamed of! Ataru! Ata... Uh, I mean, Mr. Moroboshi. Don't worry. I have a position for you. You can be my gatekeeper. No problem. No problem at all! I see! I see now! A harem! I have to do it! It was for this purpose that I was born! I'm going to build it! I'm going to build a harem on a universal scale... the ultimate harem! All the women in the universe will be mine! Lady Elle, a message has just come in from Babara. He has come. I can finally see him. What should I do? My heart is pounding so hard that it's like walking atop a cloud. It's been so long! These 11 years have been so long! But I can finally see him again. Right? Yes, Lady Elle. Ataru! Ataru! Oh! Ataru! Wait! Over here. Honey, are you sure you're not angry about the mistake I made earlier? It's still bothering you? Don't be silly. Come on! This way! Wait up! Damn! Ataru's having a ball. We came all this way, just to watch them flirt?! A beauty of such caliber... Will I ever understand the hearts of women? Still, if Ataru is acceptable to her, then I have a chance, too. Beautiful girls, honor, rank and a harem. Not too shabby! Love is cemented by how a couple first meets. Eleven years of waiting... I, Mendou Shutaro, will fix that. How nostalgic... We first played tag just like this, on that day 11 years ago... Eh? Oh, yes. Even now I remember. The sunset on Earth that day, the small park, our long shadows. For eleven years, I've thought about it over and over again. Eleven years ago... I'm really surprised that you grew up to be so beautiful... ...and queen of this planet as well! That's something else! Is it? It was decided from the time I was born... ...so I haven't thought about it. Whatever I want, I'm given. Everyone obeys my commands. But you're different, because you chose me of your own free will. Uh... well... y... yeah. Excuse me. Lady Elle, it's time for fitting your dress for tomorrow. See you later, Honey. Allow me... Tonight, here... W... What? Mendou, don't waste your time. You'll just embarrass yourself. We shall see. Miss Elle... My apologies for keeping you waiting. The others found it hard to sleep. I, Mendou Shutaro, knew from the moment our eyes first met, that... ...destiny meant for us to be together. This key you gave me today... is it, as I suspect, the key to your boudoir? Not bad looking. I liked you right off. Looks like at least SOME Earthmen are handsome. What a dark room... I wonder, is this your private room? W... what's this? This is my sacred inner sanctum. Now use the key and open it. They're all handsome guys! I won't be beaten! You won't beat me! What do you think? Aren't they all handsome? I love all of them and they all love me. You will be the 100,000th one. W... Why... Why do you do this? Love is a fragile thing. Love that is bright in the morning fades by sunset. To keep love always fresh, prevent spoilage, and make it eternal... ...I developed this refrigerator of love! Now come. To commemorate the 100,000 mark... ...I will ensure that you are thoroughly frozen! What kind of woman is she?! We seized an opportunity and followed them, but now this... this isn't funny! When it comes to harems, this girl is way ahead of you! We'll have to escape from here, even if we have to hijack a spaceship! We're outta here! Help me! NO! Help me! NO! W... What do we do? I'm sure we will never forget the name of Mendou, who sacrificed himself... ...to buy us precious time! Sorry! Agreed! No! Stop it! NO! NO! I'm afraid of the dark! I'm claustrophobic! Mendou! Mendou, hold on! How did you get in here?! How dare you interrupt the sacred ceremony of love! What ceremony of love?! This is just some collection! Don't mix up the hotblooded passion between man and woman... ...with frozen tuna! You dare to lecture me?! Help! Help me, Miss Lum! Miss Lum! Men be damned! Lady Elle! Where's Honey?! Let go! Let go! I don't want to be turned into a popsicle! No! No! Honey! Honey, why did you try to run away? Don't come near me! Why? Honey, don't you love me anymore? Damn right I don't! You flirt! You floozy! You enemy of all men! I never want to see you again! No! That's not fair! I love you! I love you with all my heart, Honey! Then what's with the refrigerator?! It was just flirting, a little like a hobby, something anyone might do. You yourself lived with that Oni-girl, you might recall... The scale is totally different! No! The whole thing's intrinsically different! It's disgusting to call this "flirting!" It's absolutely unforgivable! Then, you mean... I want to cancel the wedding. The wedding is tomorrow. I have no intention, absolutely no intention, of marrying you! Honey, no one will take you from me. Lock him up until the wedding! Let go! Let me go! What shall we do with the others? Freeze them all... ...then put them inside a cardboard box and send them back to Earth! I never want to see them again! Understood! No! Stop! Help! Lady Elle... Not a single word! Hurry up with the wedding preparations. Why are you so intent on marrying such a man? You'll never understand. The engine sound is almost there. Rei, hand me that wrench. By the way, Oyuki, what are you going to do now? I'll give you a lift if you're going home. Kurama says she's taking off tonight, so I'll ask her for a lift. It's unfortunate that I couldn't attend Lum's wedding ceremony, but... What a sorry figure that husband of hers is. He's so stupid, it's not even worth storming the place. Lum must be in pain. Lum... what are you going to do? Goodbye, Darling... Think only of me... ...look only at me... ...that's what I told him... Darling... Stupid Darling... Darling, the ring is shining. Look, I'm trembling in the wind. I seem to hear a gentle whisper calling to me. Though there is more love than there are stars... ...there is only one love for you and I. An unbroken thing... ...that is my "love" for you. Darling, are you wearing the ring? Now, I'm looking at the stars. Like a screen projecting our memory, you're smiling. Even though you're not beside me... ...our love will be one forever. An unbroken thing... ...that is my "love" for you. Darling... Hey. Hey, you! Answer when somebody talks to you! Ah, maybe it's too much to ask... Tomorrow, you're going to get married to that woman... ...but its more like a condemned man's last night, isn't it? Even an idiot like you can understand that! Well, good riddance! This is your punishment for mistreating Lum... ...the inevitable consequence of your prior misdeeds! You deserve to be stuck on this planet for the rest of your life... ...chained to that girl. Better for Lum... Better yet for universal peace! I hope you're miserable! I hope you're suffering! I hope you're in pain! I hope you're sad! Poor Lum felt just the same way about you! YOU SLIMEBALL! That's all I have to say! Good night! Lum... Are you crying? I'M AN IDIOT! I... I... I... l'm a jerk! She was always getting in the way... When I even got close to another girl, she yelled, screamed, cried... ...and finally she'd pulverize me with high-voltage electricity! And yet, and yet, she always thought only of me... She always cared only for me... She always cared only for me... This is the City Guard! No civilians or tourists are allowed past this point! Greetings to all of you out there in TV land... ...on Planet Elle, and to all you Bug-Eyed Monsters watching via satellite. Today we're live in Baran, the capital city of Elle... ...to bring you the wedding ceremony of Queen Elle. Look at this! The central gate area is packed with people from nearby star systems... ...who are here just to see Lady Elle's wedding. Wow. This is pretty incredible. I read in a magazine that Lady Elle has waited for this day since childhood. Eleven years of patient love... How romantic! Right. Right. Gimme another, bartender. Hey, Rose, cut it out! Drinking during the day is bad for you, you know. All right, all right. Eleven years of love. And who brought her lover to her? But even so, I get a reprimand for a minor mistake! Now I'll interview people from other planets. Ah, excuse me, Miss... where are you from? Eh? Ah... I'm from nearby... I have to go now... Hey... Miss... No, it can't be. Ladies and gentlemen! Thank you for your patience. The wedding of Lady Elle and Moroboshi Ataru will now commence. Ahem... I am Kemododos, your Master of Ceremonies. I am not used to this so I beg all of you to excuse my... Shut up! On with the ceremony! The groom and the bride will now enter. Please give them a warm welcome! Look at Lady Elle's unparalleled beauty. Her wedding dress is most beautiful. The groom, who came from Planet Earth, looks so happy he's grimacing! Oh! The groom has collapsed! What's wrong with him? The strain must be affecting him. He looks very pale. It might even be said that he is all worn out. I'm back. So, how was it out there? Incredibly tight security. The church is located in the central tower area and is off-limits. Heh, I expected as much. Hey, you really think Lum is in the city? Absolutely. She's just waiting for her chance to act. She'll get it when we create a little diversion... Anyway, what are you doing here, Ran? Don't you want revenge on Lum? Perish the thought! We're childhood friends. I'm just here to help! How about you, Kurama? I know better than anyone the pain of being forced to marry someone. Ah, you're all so full of good intentions. That's good... In this case, the more the merrier. We'd better get going. ...and so, I feel that Lady Elle is most fortunate to have found... ...such a pure-hearted groom. That excellent speech was by Gunpot Sigma, the matchmaker. Next is... Hey! Hey, you! You over there! This area is off-limits. What are you doing here?! Calling all cars! Calling all cars! An unidentified airbike is racing toward the central tower! All units, pursue the intruder! Repeat: An unidentified airbike is racing toward the tower! All units, pursue the intruder! "A crimson airbike"...Benten! C'mon. Follow me. Follow me some more! HQ calling all cars! The speeding bike is heading from Block C-17 to Tower #27. Calling all cars! Open fire when in range! Repeat: Calling all cars! Destroy the intruder immediately! Intruder at the central gate! Security unit is in combat! What?! This is the security unit! This is the security unit! HQ, do you read?! The armored shutters are completely frozen! Unable to attack due to severe snowstorm! A monster has appeared in the restaurant district, Block B-18! A monster?! A giant tiger-cow is eating the food inside the restaurants. The beef-bowl restaurant, the noodle stand... ...and many others are being damaged. Request military assistance. Help! What next?! Someone has blown open the entrance to the underground chamber. The frozen men inside the refrigerator are all defrosting! NO! This is the refrigerator! This is the refrigerator! The defrosting studs are rioting because they heard about Lady Elle's wedding. Send help immediately! Send help immediately! Charge! Smash the wedding ceremony! I've been kept waiting so long! No way I'll be her second lover! You lucky stiff! I'm No. 99,202! Hey you! Won't you marry me? What about you? Wouldn't you like to have a strong child with me? Somebody help preserve the Kurama line! You over there! No, you! Send the 3rd and 4th mobile units to the central gate! Half the patrol cars and the 2nd and 3rd air wings will destroy the monster! Everyone else, take care of the riot! Patrol Car 101. Patrol Car 101. What's wrong? Commander! Patrol Car 101 is not responding! At a time like this? Get them on the screen! Oh no! Th... That's the Oni-girl, the one on top of the Anti-Wedding Group Blacklist! She's heading toward the church dome, with no pursuit! Air wings, return immediately! Destroy the patrol unit heading toward the church dome! The bride and groom will now exchange their vows. Everyone, please be quiet! Following the ancient customs, after the exchange of vows... ...the ceremony will be concluded with a kiss between bride and groom. Lady Elle de Rosenbach, 888th princess of the Kingdom of Elle... ...do you take this man as your lawfully wedded husband? Yes. Moroboshi Ataru, Tomobiki High School 2nd year, section 4. We'll skip the rest... And now, the kiss. Honey. Hold it. Let... Let me go! Stop it! What a sore loser. Honey, you're all mine now! Silence! Silence! The ceremony isn't over yet! Now, Honey. Darling! Darling! Darling! Darling! Lum! Darling! Lum! Darling... So you're Lum, the Oni-girl? And you're Elle, the Darling-thief? I'll make you eat those words! Babara! Guards! Grab them! Smash the wedding! You're not getting away! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Lum, stop! It's no use! All right! Activate the vacuum, full power! Roger. Wha... Lady Elle and the groom have been kidnapped! Shoot 'em down! OK! Recovery completed. We're out of here! Gotcha! Fire! Stop, you idiots! Lady Elle is inside that... What the?! Ooops! I accidentally hit the warp switch... You imbecile! If you warp from here then we're going to! Eleven years ago, when I was still a little girl... ...Babara brought me to Planet Earth. The sunset was beautiful. The small park, with the jungle gym and swings... ...and then behind me was Honey. Under a crimson glowing sunset... ...I was invited to play shadow tag. You, a stranger, chased my long shadow. Happily dodging you, my tears disappeared. Why is my heart so happy, cheerfully pounding? If the two of us run, smiles everywhere, I won't be lonely anymore. All alone, swinging on a swing... ...I don't even pretend to be happy. Like a page from a picture book... ...I dream, in the midst of a light breeze. I want to play always; Night, don't you come. If the two of us run, smiles everywhere, I won't be all alone. Why is my heart so happy, cheerfully pounding? If the two of us run, smiles everywhere, I won't be all alone. I've heard of a custom whereby people get engaged by stepping on... ...one another's shadows, but it's a very old custom hardly anyone remembers. That girl runs fast. All right! There! I got it! What?! Stop! Hold it! Hold it right there! Look everyone! Look at this! I remember now! I remember everything now! The little me was so determined to catch her that he got giddy... ...and blurted out that he'd stepped on her shadow, when he hadn't! The engagement is null and void! Uh-huh. So that's what happened. Moroboshi! Don't you feel that even for you, this is just too irresponsible?! You son of a! I'm speechless with disgust... I am afraid that my younger self has caused much trouble. I'm sorry. It's clear that this was the action of a small, ignorant child. Please smile and forgive. You apologize, too! Darling, you shouldn't make yourself cry! It's nobody's business if I make myself cry! Now, now. Don't cry now. Now, now. Don't cry now. Lady... You brat! Where are you touching her?! You did it again. Why do you like to make yourself so miserable?! This is all his fault! This brat! This me! This me! Lady, you're pretty. You'd better go home. OK! Lady Elle! Lady Elle, I'm so glad you're all right. Leave here immediately! Don't ever come near this planet again! Babara, what is the status of the riot? A few hundred of them are still at large. But it's only a matter of time. Not one of them must escape. All of them are my handsome lovers. As you wish. I'm stuffed. Can't eat another bite. I'm sorry, Lum. Don't mention it. Everyone wake up. We're here. Hurry up and get out! In another hour we'll be charged another day's rental. Who do you think's paying for it, anyway? I sure wish they could tell the difference between landing and crashing. Still, I'm finally back on beloved Mother Earth... huh? W... What the?! What's going on here?! This is OUR wedding. Now that we've settled the Elle problem, we can begin anew. Darling? Darling, don't you want to? Uh, no, not at all. I... l'm just surprised... It's so sudden, that's all. Now we will perform the exchange of vows. Do you swear to love this man for the rest of your life? I swear. And do you swear to love this woman for the rest of your life? What's wrong, Darling? Are you feeling all right? NO! Darling! Catch him! Today I'll say his requiem! Let Moroboshi go! I haven't given up hope yet! NO! NO! No, no, no, no! I, I, I, I won't put up with I, I, I, I won't put up with wishi-washiness. I, I, I, I won't put up with I, I, I, I won't put up with wishi-washiness. You, You, You, You, need courage for love. You, You, You, You, need Everything is born from you and I. Everything is born from you and I. I don't want a man who just puts on a tough act. I don't want a man who just puts on a tough act. I don't want a man who just puts on a tough act. I don't want a man who just puts on a tough act. Love me, strong-willed Darling. Hold me, weak-willed Darling. Kiss me, wonderful Darling. Kiss me, wonderful Darling. I'll always be ready to I'll always be ready to be in love with you. I'll always be ready to I'll always be ready to be in love with you.
