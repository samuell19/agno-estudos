Password? ﻿What password? ﻿You should be grateful I even managed to come at this hour. ﻿So stubborn. ﻿I learned from the best. ﻿At least you know who's the boss. ﻿So that's why you tremble every time you see my mom. ﻿Fine. I'll give you that. ﻿I got you something. ﻿It's simple, but I wanted you to have something to remind you of me. ﻿In case a hotter guy comes along? ﻿Don't push it! ﻿Just because he chose to die, ﻿doesn't mean you have to die. ﻿He had no choice. ﻿Abed was in prison and he tried to- ﻿Don't tell me he tried. ﻿He went on a hunger strike, got sick and died. ﻿Instead of serving his time and coming back home to you, his wife, ﻿and experiencing true resistance like the rest of us. ﻿They would have never let him go, and you know it. ﻿Abed is free now, under the ground. Be free above it. ﻿How? ﻿Live, Nabila. ﻿What is life without him? I'm doing Jihad. ﻿I am sacrificing my life for my country, for the cause. ﻿How many people can say that? ﻿That is not the true meaning of Jihad. ﻿That is the excuse of the weak. This is suicide. ﻿If your father were here- ﻿Dad is dead! ﻿Abed is dead! ﻿Abed loved me! ﻿I love you ﻿I love my unborn grandchild! ﻿Abed loved himself! ﻿Again Nabila. Stronger. ﻿Stronger. ﻿Faster. ﻿It’s harder than I thought. ﻿The pregnancy is making me slower. ﻿Use all of your senses. ﻿If they're on to you before you manage to explode, you have to be able to attack somehow. ﻿Otherwise this is all in vain. ﻿How is she doing? ﻿She needs a few more days. ﻿Do you feel ready? ﻿Getting there, God willing. ﻿You will, with God's blessing. We believe in you. ﻿They will never see it coming. ﻿I saw Abed in my dream. ﻿He is very pleased with what you're doing. ﻿Come ﻿Push Nabila, push. ﻿Come on, Nabila. ﻿One more time. ﻿It's all over, all over. ﻿Your son, Nabila. ﻿Peace be upon you. ﻿And peace be upon you. ﻿What is it, Nabila? We need to talk... ﻿Maybe things have changed. ﻿Sister, keep your faith in God. ﻿Then believe He will help you pass through the border. ﻿Did you forget you were the one who asked to do this? ﻿Insisted even. ﻿You said Abed was your whole life. ﻿Has that changed? ﻿Of course not. ﻿But I'm a mom now and my son needs me. ﻿Now you care about your son? ﻿I'm just not sure anymore. ﻿Nabila, I don't think you understand. We are the resistance. ﻿When we start an operation, we finish it. ﻿If you don't finish what you started, you will pay the price. ﻿You and your whole family! ﻿Just like Abed did. ﻿If dad were alive, do you think he would have been pleased with me? ﻿Dad was a dreamer. ﻿And he raised us to be dreamers as well. Blind ones. ﻿You're a dreamer like he was. ﻿You're just not blind anymore. ﻿Maybe he was right? ﻿I don't want to leave my son. ﻿What you want is to free Palestine. ﻿Only sacrifice and resistance will free Palestine. ﻿Your son will benefit from your martyrdom. ﻿He'll benefit more from growing up with his mother. ﻿All kids grow up with their mothers. ﻿But not all grew up to understand the meaning of our cause, ﻿of martyrdom and of sacrifice. ﻿What happened to us? ﻿Did you forget where we come from? ﻿What we fight for? ﻿What we want? ﻿No. But maybe- ﻿There is no maybe. We don't have that luxury. ﻿I raise my kids to fight and to sacrifice when the time comes. ﻿I will raise yours the same. ﻿Careful. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿He's coming with me, like he was supposed to. ﻿No. The boy stays here. ﻿I gave him life. I decide when he leaves it. ﻿A child should be with his mother. ﻿Take this permit. Give it to the soldiers at the border. ﻿You should be able to pass. ﻿Give him to me. Alright. ﻿You can both became martyrs today. ﻿Remember I'll be taking care of your family. ﻿Like I promised. ﻿Next. ﻿What's your name? ﻿Nisrine. ﻿Next. ﻿What's your name? ﻿Yussuf. ﻿Next. ﻿You. Come over here. ﻿Come on, I don't have all day. ﻿a suspicious person. Need backup. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Sorry. ﻿He's very sick. ﻿The hospitals in Jenin aren't good. ﻿Please, let us pass. ﻿What's going on? Your line isn't moving. ﻿It's okay. ﻿You can pass. ﻿Thank you. Thank you. ﻿Next. ﻿Sleep, sleep my boy. ﻿I will sacrifice a dove for you. ﻿Don't you worry doves, ﻿I'm just pretending... ﻿For my sleeping baby. ﻿This is yours. ﻿So I'm always with you. ﻿Oh Allah! I am your servant. ﻿Daughter of your male servant, ﻿and daughter of your maid. ﻿My forehead is in your hand. ﻿Your judgement is exact. ﻿Your decision about me is just. ﻿I ask you by every name of yours, which you have called yourself. ﻿Or revealed in a book of yours, or taught to any of your servants, ﻿or reserved within your unrevealed knowledge, ﻿to make the Quran a spring to my heart, ﻿a light in my chest, that it removes my sadness, ﻿and erase my anguish. ﻿Forgive me.
