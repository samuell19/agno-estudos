Thanks. Mark. Looks good on you. She's here. Her strides are just the proper length. You can hear the click of her ankles. Her footsteps are virtually silent. Hi, Cheryl. Checkmate. I never want to be the bodyguard for a kid again. Real pros don't pick and choose their jobs. Pros, huh. Either I kill them, or they kill me. That's fine with me. I'm looking forward to my next job. You imagined it. You know better than anyone that it couldn't be your period. But, Doctor. There's nothing wrong. You're in excellent shape. Relax yourself. Let go of all your tension. That's the way. Don't you feel much lighter now? Shut out all distractions. All of them. Well? Did you make him beg for mercy? That wasn't part of our contract. This is Ko Sawamura. He's coming from Hong Kong to pick up some goods. Get the stuff and kill him. She's disciplined. My ears are shells... that long for the sound of the sea. Catching anything? No luck. There are some big ones out there. Don't have the right tackle. Well? Sounds like Mark turned him down. What are you two hanging around here for? We had a bet on how many fish you'd catch. Right, Cheryl? The sea is dead. Can't even catch a minnow. Maybe you're the one who's dead. Cheryl. What's that supposed to mean? I'll do it. What? Back off, or you'll get yourself killed one of these days. I hear you, Mark. So tell us about the offer. I didn't like the sounds of it. The guy's a creep. Real pros don't pick and choose their jobs, right? Mark! Ko Sawamura. He's a gem cutter in Hong Kong. Lucky Ear! Freeze. Ko Sawamura? Yeah. I'm Cheryl. You're a woman! I asked for a professional bodyguard! I am a pro. Don't waste my time. There's a man 300 meters up ahead. If he's a sniper then he'll blow your head off. Where's the man?! Those idiots. I never asked for any woman! I'll make them pay a penalty! Absolutely no outside calls. Got it? Tell me your plan. Fat chance. I can't trust a woman. Gems make women crazy. Get me a male replacement. Give me a break. There isn't a single woman who doesn't lust after gems. Every woman I've had sex with did. You want them too, right? Don't pretend otherwise. Woman only have eyes for things that glitter. I'm not like other women. Women throughout the world are all the same. Gluttonous, selfish and lusty. Beautiful women like you are the most dangerous of all. Well you don't have to worry about me. I have no womb. What do you want me to do? I have some important gems hidden somewhere. Once I get them, help me escape back to Hong Kong. Okay. What do you mean, you have no womb? We'll go as soon as the sun comes up. Get some rest in the meantime. How much do you want? Isn't some action with you included in the contract? I've never met a woman with no womb. I'll pay you. Damn you! I'm the client here! A woman. Get me a nice woman! A woman. Mari from the escort service. I called for her. Open it up. Hands on the desk! What's this?! What's going on?! Forget about her! Money will take care of everything, right? I'll pay you a third more. I'm glad you're here. Got a thing for being watched? You stupid woman! Let's go in there. Mari, was it? That's right. I'm Ko Sawamura. Wait up! Move! How'd they find me? How did they know?! The line was tapped. They sent their escort instead of the real one. Hey! Maybe I underestimated you. A real pro makes all the difference. My judgment is flawless. I knew right away you were the only one who could protect me. You! Shoot him! Sawamura! They hired the Owl! The Owl? Once the Owl comes after you, there's no escaping! Why didn't you shoot him?! You had him unarmed! He'll come back for me. He'll hunt us down if he has to go to every corner of the earth. That's what the Owl is like! If you'd just shot him, I would've beat them! Why didn't you shoot him back there?! Why didn't you shoot him?! Those gems you have hidden. Did you steal them from the people after you? You're curt but you have good perception. I'm a good shot, too. They run an underground bank in Hong Kong. They get me to produce fakes of their bank clients' gems. Then they steal the real ones. I can do it in a single night. But I'm even better than that. In one night, I knock off two fake gems. Why do you figure? Because I steal the original and give them back two fakes. You're revolting. A great bodyguard for a revolting man. Hey! What's the meaning of this, locking me in here?! Stop fucking around! Open up! Open up right now! Hey! Stop screwing around! Come on! Open the door! It's just a flesh wound. Your body is strong. It'll heal up before you know it. Why do you put yourself in such danger? Want to die so young and beautiful? I can't let you die. Trust me. Your beauty will last for a long time yet. I'll do anything to make your body last forever. What's the matter? You have to release the tension. The way you always do. Shut out any distractions. What's wrong?! Something's different about you! Cheryl? Cheryl! Cheryl. What's happened? Cheryl! Catch anything yet? No, not even a bite. Maybe you lost your bait. The fish was better than you. What did he mean, "lost your bait"? Something's wrong with Cheryl. I can't go into details, but she's acting different. I was wondering if something had happened on her job. Where's Cheryl? Like I said, I can't go into details. Don't, Mark! Stop kidding around! Mark! Mark! That's all I can tell you. Really! She's at the doctor's place. So you're Mark, aren't you? She mentions you from time to time. She trusts you more than any other man. I didn't know that Cheryl was being treated here. There's only the two of us, in the whole world. We're the only ones who know her secret. Why do you always make her do such dangerous jobs? I don't force her. But you do, in reality. She's alright, isn't she? She was until this morning, at least. Where is she? I don't know. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. I don't want to let her die! Do you? No, I don't. This'll cost you extra. These drinks are all the sales I need for today. I can close up early now. Don't stiff me. What happened? Did I tell you where I buried my arm? Under a Baobab tree. In Zaire. The guerillas there coat their knives with poison. It was just a flesh wound, but it ended up costing me my arm. After they amputated and I looked at the rotted arm, I was overwhelmed with sorrow. Are you familiar with the Baobab tree? Legend has it that the tree was uprooted by evil... and stuck back in the ground upside down. It seemed like the perfect shape of tree to bury my arm under. I'd like to see that Baobab tree once more. Once more, before I die. What do you think? Want to go with me? Cheryl? He's alive. He's still alive. He was "the Owl", the one that came after Sawamura and me. It was him. He was just like before. That face, those familiar eyes. I tried to shoot, but I couldn't. I should've shot, but I couldn't. Not bad, if I do say so myself. It's bewitching. You don't seem bothered, being cooped up in this place. You and I are linked by fate. You made the Owl your enemy, now we're both gonna die. I'm going to give this to you. No one will know it's an imitation. People try their hardest to compensate when something's lacking. You have no womb. That's why you try harder than anyone to be more of a woman. I don't hold it against people for making a good effort. I want to return to Hong Kong tomorrow night. You'll stick to the contract, won't you. Have you ever been in love? No. Loving someone is a waste of energy. After all, you're born and die alone. Then why not die?! Go ahead and die! What's going on?! This isn't funny! What'd I do?! Welcome. Gimlet. Make it dry. Right. It reeks. It does reek. Smells like something rotten. Must be the canal out back. No, it's hanging in this bar. Maybe you brought it in with you. Yeah, I thought so. It's like the taste of aluminum, or the sound of scorching glass. Not very pleasant. I see. Yeah, it smells like rusted metal. So, you're Mark? Correct. You know my name, right? You're the famous ear collector. How do you decide whether to take the left or the right? I take the one with no earwax. - I'd take your left one. - Why? If I took your right, you'd get even more off-balance and fall over. Where is she? I don't understand the question. Forgetful, huh? My brains were all in my right arm. Where are you going? You'll make it to your ship on time tonight. Cheryl! Mark's been hit. Mark! Mark. The Owl. The Owl did this! What're you doing? Move it! There's been a change of plans. What's this?! You'd be better off if you get straight on the ship back to Hong Kong. Don't be ridiculous! Why do you think I put myself in danger and came to Japan?! I can't go back without the goods! You'll die. The Owl will be waiting for you. Still wanna go get your stuff? I can't go back empty-handed. People in Hong Kong are waiting for these gems! Either way, you'll die. Stick to the contract. Your job's to help me get the goods then see that I return to Hong Kong. Stick to the contract! Okay. Freeze. Got them. Yeah, both of them. Good. Get Sawamura to show you where the diamonds are hidden. Get rid of the woman. Cheryl! Cheryl! What's wrong with this thing?! Where's the Owl? Where's the Owl?! We won! We beat them! The Owl's not here. All the better. Come on! You're the best. Of all the woman I've met to date, you're the best. Will you come to Hong Kong with me? You can get as many clients as you want. Don't die, Cheryl. You don't stand a chance against Cheryl. You can kill Mark and I, but you'll never kill Cheryl. You're going to die. Cheryl's going to kill you. Where is she? Did you really think I'd tell you? Cheryl, it's me. Lucky Ear?! What's wrong?! The Owl's after the doctor. The Owl is?! Hurry, help the doctor. Are you alright, Lucky Ear?! Don't worry about me. I never felt so alive. See you. I love you, Cheryl. Lucky Ear! Lucky Ear! Why do you want to know so much about her? You're an excellent doctor. That's rare, for someone Japanese. He was born in Thailand. He did Thai kickboxing for years. He met him when they were rising through the kickboxing ranks. They were bound to compete for the championship title one day. That's when he really got to know himself. To know that he could only love a man. He didn't want to fight the other man, so he simply vanished... because he wanted to be loved by him, more than he wanted to fight him. She was a man. He had the sex change operation and became a woman. She loved him. That's how much she loved him. Were you the man she loved?! By the time she'd made the total change... the man had disappeared. Poor Cheryl. She was devastated. Cheryl! Stay away! Cheryl! Doctor! I've been a hit man for ten years. I figured nothing could surprise me anymore. Why did you disappear? What's the point of asking that now? I gave up everything. I have a right to know. For money. There was no money in the ring; it was elsewhere. You know that. Is it really you? I didn't know you loved me that much. Shoot. Nothing has changed. You can't shoot. Will you join my side? We'd make a good team.
