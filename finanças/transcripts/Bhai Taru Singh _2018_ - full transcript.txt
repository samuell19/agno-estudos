Ripped by gdhaliwal23 On 10-December-1710 Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah issued orders for complete annihilation of Nanak Panthis (Sikhs). The then Governor of Lahore Abdul Samad Khan started capturing and killing Sikhs from all over Punjab. After death of Bahadur Shah his son and successor Farukh Siyar announced that the orders against Sikhs be considered valid for all times. In Punjab Sikhs were subjected to extreme torture and Singhs were captured and summarily executed. In 1726 Abdul Samad Khan' son Zakria Khan was appointed as G ovemor of Punjab. Immediately upon taking charge he started persecuting Singhs with more zeal. Zakria Khan spread his spies all over Punjab. Singhs were forced to take shelter in Jungles, Hills and desert. But greedy Police Officers and spies had become cruel beasts. Even ordinary Hindus and Muslims too couldn't escape their greed and lust. A day in Lahore during those dreaded times. Diwan he, have Sikhs been wiped out or not'! Sir, our armies are going through each village and ourinformers are operating everywhere. Sikhs of all ages are being arrested as soon as they are found. That sounds fine but how long will this continue? Our expenses have tripled. All government officials are going after the Sikhs and this has diminished our tax collection capacity. Sir, I am not taking it easy but I need more time. Pillars have erected all over the city with severed heads of the Sikhs. I don't know what makes these Sikhs so tough. Thousands have been killed but not a single one has given up Sikhi. SikhilSikhilSikhims... I am tired of hearing these words. Wipe these Sikhs out for good. Sir, I am doing my best. No signs of Sikhs can be seen in far-flung areas. Those who have taken shelter in jungles are being searched and killed. But pardon me Lord, what difference does it make to kill them elsewhere when they are protected right here'! What do you mean? Sir, hundreds of Sikhs are living wit hout any fear in Lahore itself. Even sights of severed heads of their brethren don't deter them. They don't even miss opportunities to cremate those killed by us. When an official order has been given to wipe out all Sikhs, then how come they are living right under my nose? How will I face the Emperor at Delhi. Why the orders are not being followed. Explainl! Sir, I beg your pardon. I have no say in the city's matters. Stop making these excuses! Arrest all the Sikhs living inside Lahore today. I wish to say something with your permission. Speak UP- Sir, the Sikhs living in Lahore city are skilled workers. Many of them are carpenters and masons. They help in develpoment and maintenance of the city. If we kill them, the development of the city will be stopped. The govemmenfs and police's performance has already suffered. What do you mean? With your orders Sardar Subegh Singh is under arrest. Everybody knows that Subegh Singh is an excellent administrator and Mathematician and there is none as capable as him. Even being a sikh he honestly served economic affairs of Lahore darbarfor so many years. Diwan Kaura Mal is telling right Sir. Alright, don't touch them for now. But make their lives harder so that they turn away from Sikhi on their own. Ha... Ha... Today's court is now dismissed. May your majesty soar higher! A man has been waiting to appear before you for the last three days. Bring him in. Your name? Rahim Baksh, Sir What do you need? Sir, I am a poor fisherman. I survive by selling fish and running a boat. What you have to say'! Sir, please save this poor man's honor. My only child, sixteen years old Salma, has been abducted. Who has made this mistake of dishonoring a Muslim girl in the Mughal empire? Sir, I am a subject of Faujdaar of Patti. It is under his orders that my daughter has been abducted. And now his men are pressuring me to many her off to him. Are you talking about Jafar Begh, the Faujdaar of Patti? Look, he is a successful officer. And he is very effective in wiping out the Sikhs. And then He is my cousin as well. I can not interfere in his matters. Sir, you are my only hope. Have mercy on me. I am a subject of yours. Please save my honor. I daily pray five Namaaz live a truthful life and as a true Muslim believe in Khuda. Please save my honour sir please.. Save... Man! Didn't you understand my point'! Go and plead in front of Jafar Begh. If he wishes your daughter can be returned to you. Sir, I have already appeared before Faujdaar Sahib. I have come to your court after being turned away by him. Please save my honorin the name of Allah othenmise my life isn't worth living. It's time for me to rest. Leave now. Have mercy... Lord, have mercy. Let go of my feet. Go to Delhi and plead in front of the Emperor. Perhaps he can help you. Abba... please save me. I will not many this beast. Abba (crying) Raheem Baksh, tell your daughter to come to her senses. I will give her all the comforts of life if she marries me. Othenmise, she will perish in confinement. I'll consume poison and kill myself Abba...aaaaaa.. I'll die but I won't let anyone force my daughter against herwill. I'm taking away what belongs to my master. Ha.. Ha.. Ha.. No! Let go of my daughter ... ..let her go. Allah! Have mercy. You seem troubled by grief. But remember that sorrow and happiness are like the clothes one wears in life. And times do change. I don't know what Allah has in store for me. I see no end to my sorrows. Listen to me. Just down the road, there is village Poohla. On its outskirts is the abode of a saint. He earnestly serves everyone who shows up at his door. You should rest there overnight and leave for your destination in the morning. Your mind will find comfort in the company of this saintly man. What is the name of that saint? Bhai Tam Singh. What! A Singh? Speak softly. I am a Muslim fisherman. Why would a Sikh help me'! Listen, that house belongs to Guru Nanak. Caste and religion based differences have no place there. Everyone is treated as creation of the same Lord. That's believable but how did this Singh get spared in the Mughal Empire'! While the Government has decreed complete decimation of all sikhs. I have told you that Bhai Taru Singh is a saintly soul and he is respected by all. He has a big heart and helps everyone though thick and thin. I am returning from Lahore where hundreds of Sikh men, women and children are murdered everyday. To scare people, pillars of severed heads of sikhs are erected at different places all over the city. Government spies are actively searching for Sikhs. Didn't anybody report Bhai Taru Singh'! Listen brother, Hindus and Muslims living in the surrounding villages hold Bhai Taru Singh in high regard. Now you should go to him without further delay. Right Sir. May GOD bless you. I am blind; Your Name is my anchor and support. I am poor and powerless. Your name is my source of strength. I am blind; Your Name is my anchor and support. O benevolent and merciful Lord, You are so generous. You pervade everywhere, within and before me. I am blind; Your Name is my anchor and support. You are the primal river, You are the wealthiest Giver of all. You alone give or take away; there is none else. I am blind; Your Name is my anchor and support. You are the wisest oracle, how could I understand yourways'! O my Master, You are the merciful Lord of forgiveness. I am blind; Your Name is my anchor and support. Come in. Welcome. I am returning to my village from Lahore but it has gotten dark. Come in. Guru's Langaris ready. Please eat and make yourself comfortable. Waheguru! What are you doing'! Get up and sit here. On this cot. No santji, I am fine here. You are my respectable elder. Please call me Taru Singh. This hymn that you were singing, is it composed by Guru Nanak? It was very soothing to my heart. No, it was composed by Naam Devjee. Is Naamdev jee your Guru'! Naamdevjee was a pious person whose spirit merged with Allah. Guru Sahib has given his hymns the same respect as Gurbani itself. Please eat. Where did bhagatji live? Bhagatji lived in the south and was a washerman by occupation. Awasherman! Isn't that a lower caste? A particular occupation doesn't make one low, instead his deeds do. Those who unite with the Lord are pious regardless of their caste. Gurbani says. “First, Allah created the Light...“ "From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad?" These are very pious words. Then why do Sikhs have become government enemies'! Sikhs never seeks enmity with anyone but they are ordained to take a stand against tyranny and to protect the downtrodden. May Allah protect you all because there is no one else to help the poor. What happened? Seems you are in some problem. Faujdaar of Patti has abducted my daughter, Salma. I have begged him to let her go but he has been blinded by lust. Zakaria Khan in Lahore too has turned me away. This is grave injustice. Khan Bahadartold me to appear before the Emperorin Delhi. What Khan Bahadar'? You can not expect any justice from these wicked rulers. Jafar Beg has locked up my daughter. Upon his orders, I have tried to persuade her for a change of mind but she has made it clear that she w0n't many the old beast. Kudos to her! Tyranny will get wiped out if everyone takes a stand against it. Sikhs are the only hope for the helpless these days. Even Salma said that nobody other than the Sikhs is going to help us. Please get up. Guru Nanak Sahib will protect you. Allah Himself has brought me to your doorsteps. Please do something; othenmise the Faujdarwill have hired Qazis solemnize his nikah with Salma. I'll see what can be done. Please eat and make yourself comfortable. Sister, get the two kurtas too that you had sewn. But veerji, those are meant for you. My kurta is still in good condition. I can get another one later. But those Guru' Singhs need them more than me. Go fast and bring them. Mataji I should leave now. [WaheguruflilkalkhalsagWahegurutlilKilkateh! (WahegurulilKalkhalsajWahegqurufilKilzateh. I am not afraid of losing my youth, as long as I do not lose the Love of my Husband Lord. Fareed, so many youths, without His Love, have dried up and withered away. Have dried up and withered away. If You tell me to, O my Friend, I will cut off my head and give it to You. My eyes long for You; when will I see Your Vision? [WaheguruflilkalkhalsagWahegurutlilKilkateh! (WahegurulilKalkhalsajWahegqurufilKilzateh. Welcome Bhai Taru Singh ji. It took you along while today. A passerby walked in as I was about to leave. Sewing him took some time. [Wahegurufllilkalkhalsa{WahegurutlilKilkateh! (WaheguruPlilkalkhalsalWahegurublilKilEateh! We ran into a party of Mughal soldiers near Harike this morning. Somebody must have informed them about yourJatha. Yes, that seems to be the case. Dhan Dhan Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Your son Bhai Taru Singh has brought Langar with Your blessings. May the Langar be distributed among the Singhs. Please accept brave Taru Singh's seva and bless him with Naam and undying love for Sikhi. What else is going on in this area, Bhai Taru Singh'! Is everything alright in your area? The elders and leaders in our village are very kind hearted. The Muslims in the village too are well wishers of my family. May Waheguru bless such souls with happiness. Bhai Sahib, I have a request. Go ahead. The passerby who came to our house today Do as you have been told. Everybody's wishes are fulfilled at Guru Nanak's doorsteps. Khalsa will deliver on its promise. I am indebted to you. Bhai Taru Singh, you are such a kind-hearted person. Today, you asked Khalsa for a favor but that too for someone else's benefit. May Waheguru bless you with strength and undying love for Sikhi. May your conduct shine like a light house for Sikhs forever. Chachaji, Allah has listened to your daughter's prayers. Ya Allah! Hun'); up and tell me if she will be rescued. Yes, I have informed a group of Singhs who have landed in the forest about your situation. They are going to rescue Salma tonight. How will I repay the Singhs? You have helped me in utter desperation. May Allah bless you with long lives. Listen, we will meet the Singhs outside the forest soon after sunset. You will go with them for identifying Salma. Sure. Alright then. I am leaving for the fields but you should get some rest. I am not afraid of losing my youth, as long as I do not lose the Love of my Husband Lord. Fareed, so many youths, without His Love, have dried up and withered away. Have dried up and withered away. How are you Chachaji? Why do you have a worried look on your face? N..No...No...nothing. I...|.. just like that. Chachaji, you should quit smoking tobacco. I have told you so many times that it is like a poison that harms your body and soul. AIright...alright. Bhaji, I bow to your feet. How are you brother Shama? How is your father now'! We both are fine'! But bhaaji, how come you always care about others and not yourself? Don't you have any concern for your own home? Waheguru ji takes care of everybody. Who am I to take care of anyone? Bhaaji, let me say something to you clearly. You are respected by all. My brother, this is due to the Greatness of Guru Nanak. I am just a humble Sikh who is trying to follow His footsteps. You shouldn't ignore what I am trying to say. Wheneverl bring this topic up, you avoid the conversation. Alright. Tell me what you are trying to say. I don't think chacha Khushala is up to any good. He always keeps an eye on you. He has also made three trip recently to Harbhagat Niranjania in Jandiala. Is that all'! Bhaaji, don't take this lightly. Harbhagat Niranjania is a sworn enemy of the Sikhs. Even Sikh children, women and elders aren't spared under his command where every Sikh is captured and sent to Lahore. I know about all this. If you know then why don't you do something? What will we do if anything happens to you due to Khushala's ill intentions? What shall we do'! Other than the Lord, no one can kill you or save you; so why do you won'y, O my mind'? My dear brother, nobody can kill anyone. This Khushala and Harbhagat are also working in line with the Lord's wish. Don't won'y. Waheguru ji takes care of everybody. Bhai ji, you shouldn't go about so fearlessly. Listen to me and go underground for some time. Shama have I done any sin'! Why should I hide? Let's go and take a look at the fields. I have fallen in love with my Beloved Lord. Cutting it, it does not break, and releasing it, it does not let go. Such is the string the Lord has tied me with. I have fallen in love with my Beloved Lord. Day and night, He dwells within my mind; please bless me with Your Mercy, O my God. I have fallen in love with my Beloved Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my beauteous Lord; I have heard his Unspoken Speech and Story. I have heard his Unspoken Speech and Story. Servant Nanak is said to be the slave of His slaves; O my Lord and Master, please bless me with Your Mercy. O my Lord and Master, please bless me with Your Mercy. I have fallen in love with my Beloved Lord. Meharvan Singh ji! Balkar Singh, Jodh Singh, Maha Singh and I will leave on foot. We'll first overpower the guards watching outside. Chacha Rahim Baksh will go with us. You come over with our horses later on. We shall rescue sister Salma with Guru's help. Right Bhai Sahib ji. Let's do Ardaas. Ever present Satguru Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Your Khalsa is seeking your permission to launch a mission for rescuing a helpless woman in despair. Bless Your Khalsa with Your permission. Have mercy and grant success in this good cause. Nanak, Naam chardi kala tere bhaane sarbat da bhalaa. [WaheguruflilkalkhalsagWaheguruBlilKilkateh! Chachaji, do you have fear of any sort'! Why would I have any fear in the company of such brave warriors? Give me a Kirpaan too. I will cut off that wicked faujdaafs head myself. No, Chachaji today our mission is to free sister Salma. We'll take care of Faujadar some other time later. Today we need to accomplish the task swiftly without any bloodshed. Ok Khalsaji. Track the time in pace with Japji Sahib. Yourjatha will leave from here at the start of Sodar Pauri and we will gallop away with our sister before completion of the Paath. Ix Cnleer;, Selimren, (e wees Who's there? Uncover your face. Do it now! Look up. What a setup? Great job! Get opened the door. What do you say'! Yes... Yes. Who is there? Me, Rukabdeen. What do you want'! \Water. Wait. Here you go. My daughter! Salma. Al Hun'); up. The Singhs have risked theirlives for you. Bhai ji, your are God in human form. May Allah bless you with along life! You rose above cast and creed distinctions and put your lives on stake to save our daughter. How will we ever pay you back for your kindness? Chachaji, what are you doing'! I am like your son. Please get up. The Almighty Lord doesn't have any caste or creed then why do we as humans care forthem. We have simply performed our duty by saving our sister from the clutches of that beast. I don't see why the rulers hold enemity towards the Sikhs. You are like the angels who have come to this world for sharing sorrows of the poor. This is the greatness of Guru Gobind Singh Ji who taught his singhs the lesson of humanity. 0k, listen! You stay here for some days because Jafar Beg's men are lookig around for you madly Ya Allah! Don't won'y. You are safe here. Just remember not to be in the open in daylight. I hope you don't get in trouble because of us. Waheguru takes care of everybody. Don't won'y about us getting in trouble. I will inform you when it would be safe for you to reach your destination. Ya Allah, keep this kind angel in safety. Khalsa has sent their good wishes to sister Salma. Here, take these gold coins for her wedding. Allah, I've had your glimpse today. You certainly dwell in these angels. I have fallen in love with my Beloved Lord. Taru Singh, where are you going'! What's in that basket? Chacha, there are parshadas in the basket. Don't touch them with your tobacco smeared hands. Parshadey? For who? Chacha, parshadey are for the needy. Is this a question to ask? Tell me honestly, are these for the Singhs? Chacha, if you already know then why are you asking me'! I have told you many times not to feed the rebels but you don't budge. Feeding the hungry is a virtuous deed. You should stop won'ying. Listen Taru Singh! We have to live in this village. The whole village will have to pay a price because of you helping the rebels. Chacha, they are God's beloved. They don't exploit the helpless; instead, they help everyone without discriminating. Don't try to teach me. The government has ordered that no Sikh should be left alive. We, the villagers, still risk our lives to protect yourfamily. Chacha, we are deeply grateful for that. Waheguru has given you noble thoughts. Chachaji, you should stop smoking. I've told you many times that it's poisonous. Anyway, I'll do something about it. I have had enough. Please let me go. Beat him hard; he's helping the Sikhs eventhough he is a Muslim. Please let me go. I won't repeat this mistake. I got tempted by the gold coins and went with them to dress up wounds of an injured Sikh. Where are the coins that he took from the rebels'! Deposit them in the treasury othenmise you won't be able to stand on your own feet. I swearin the name of Allah. I won't keep any coins Sikhs gave me. Please let me go. Take him away and confiscate from his house. If you don't find anything throw him in jail. Let him rot there. Come in Khushala. What brings you in today? Bhagat ji I have a grave concern. A Sikh lives in our village. What did you say, a Sikh? Do you know it is a big crime to shelter a Sikh? Yes, sir, all the villagers respect him like a saint. Stop! How dare you praise a Sikh in front of me'! I'm son'); master! I did'nt mean to praise the Sikhs. All I'm saying is that the villagers would have boycotted me if I had taken any action on my own. And are they going to worship you now'! What has brought you here barking today? Master, this time he's done something that is going to bring down govemmenfs fury on the entire village. What happened? Taru Singh had a hand in the Sikhs' attack on the house of Patti's Faujdaarthat took place a few days ago. Do you people want to die'? First you have protected a Sikh in your village and on top you are partnering in his rebellious actions? Sir, I came to you as soon as I found out. Is the information correct? Yes Hazzor, few days ago one Muslim traveller stayed at his home for 3-4 days. Later his daughter and wife also joined him. Then one day suddenly they all vanished. If I am not wrong this was the same girl whom the sikhs rescued from Jaffar Begh's house. Hmmm... what does this Taru singh do'! He tends to a small piece of land he owns. He was very young when his father died in a battle against the Mughals. The villagers allowed his mother to stay because she had two young children. She's raised both of them as devout Sikhs. I will get him taken care of. Don't you delay in future. Wherever you find a sikh inform me immediately. Yes Bhagatji. Now, there are no Sikhs left. We have killed them all. Ha...ha...ha... Yes sir only a few Sikhs are left in the jungles. They too will be wiped out soon. Ha..ha..ha.. Sir time is not far when sikhs will be completely finished. I beg your pardon. I hope this doesn't become wishful thinking on your part. What do you mean? I am son'y sir but I don't think these Sikhs can be wiped out so easily. Quiet! We thought you were loyal to the government. What is this nonsense you are uttering'! Sirl have come to prove my loyalty only. The news I have for you will surprise you to no ends. Hun'); up and disclose the details. Sir you are talking about wiping out a ll the Sikhs, there's a Sikh living just outside the city walls. As if that's not enough, he also openly helps the rebels. Who is this culprit? Why hasn't he been captured yet'! This Sikh is named Taru Singh. He belongs to Sandhu subcaste and lives in village Poohla. He is the mastermind behind attack on the Faujdaar of Patti. Moman Khan! Old lady where is the govemmenfs rebel? Son, who are you talking about? There is no rebel here. Only the God's worshippers reside here. There is no need to play games with me. Tell me where your son is'! Are you talking about Taru Singh'! He is working in the fields but he will be back soon. You can rest in the meantime. I will prepare a meal for you. You seem to have traveled from far. No mataji, we are government employees. We cannot eat at your place. We have orders to arrest your whole family. Our home? No son, this is Guru Nanak's home. We are His servants and His orderis to serve with dedication anyone who comes here with. No. Produce Tam Singh now. Listen sarpanch! Make arrangements for our stay and bring Taru Singh to us. We must return to Lahore today. Yes. Soldiers tie up this girl. Mata, we are leaving you here. Produce your son quiclkly or else we'll have to use harsh means. Go dear daughter. Guru Teg Bahaduris with you. Don't be scared. Remain steadfast while accepting Guru's Will. May He protect you! Bhaji leave immediately. Lahore's Faujdaar has come to arrest you. Shama ! What are you saying"... Bhaji there is no time to talk. You head straight for the forest. But my brother. Bhaji don't won'y about us. We can take any punishment but you must escape. Shama Shama... my brother first tell me what happened? Bhaji, seems like someone has reported about you. I'm sure it is ill-spirited Khushala's dark deed. He had gone to meet Harbhagat three days ago. I'll teach him a lesson. No Shama, we should not speak impolite. It is all God's will. Bhaiji, we need you and going to Lahore means... No no bhai ji we cannot live without you. Where is the faujdaar now'! The Sarpanch and Numberdaar have taken him to the village square. He has also tied sister Taro. Waheguru. Bhaji leave without delay. Alright, you take the yoke home. I shouldn't waste more time. I will go straight to the village square. Elielle.l e? Brother Shama, I should run away only if I am a scoundrel. I haven't committed any sin or crime. They will punish the entire village if I run away. It will be sinful for me to get the villagers in trouble in order to save my life. Bhaji, you know that no Sikh has ever returned from Lahore. You are going to face certain death. My brother, the brave believers are tested during difficult times. My running away like a coward will tarnish the Singhs' dignity. Death is going to come one day anyway, then why fear it. Dear Son Matajee, I have heard that Lahore police has come to arrest me. Yes, my dear son. They are waiting for you in the village square. Why did you come home? Are you worried'! No matajee. I came over to pay you respect. Who knows whether we'll get meet again? Long live my son. May beloved Guru Gobind Singh protect you! Always remember His blessing. May the martrydom of younger Sahibzadas inspire you to maintain your Sikhi with unshom hair. Yes matajee, I came overto seek this very blessing from you. I would cut my mind and body apart into pieces, and offer them all to You; I would burn myself in fire. May I follow in the footsteps of Bhai Mani Singh ji and Baba Banda Singh Ji. Guru Teg Bahadur Sahib is always with you. Always remain steadfast in Guru's service like Bhai Mati Das, Sati Das and Bhai Dayala did. May your mind be always connected with the Guru. O Sarpanch why Taru Singh has not come till now'! Hazoorl have sent men towards the field. They should be coming any moment. Listen everybody don't try to play smart with me. My lord, I have one request. Please find some reason to spare Taru Singh's and his sister's lives? Nobody can save them. Khan Bahadar Sahib himself has ordered their capture. Bring Taru Singh here immediately; I'll have to use harsh means othenuise. Soldiers! Capture the Sarpanch and the Numberdar. We'll take them to Lahore if Taru Singh doesn't show up. Wait! Don't bother the elders. I am here. Capture this rebel before he runs away. Hey Ram jee! Why this grave injustice? This is the dark deed of despicable Khushala. He has snitched on Bhai Sahib. What is happening to me'! I've never felt so scared before. Am I doing something wrong'! Taru Singh must be a true worshipper of Allah. No...no...he is a kafir. Soldiers! Let's leave with both the rebels. Stop! Leave Bhai sahib alone if you care for your lives. Who has raised a voice in front of Moman Khan? It is me, don't touch Bhai sahib. What? A Muslim is supporting a kafifl It is the Mughal administration that is a kafir. Bhai Sahib is a respectable person. Taro is our sister. Who has the guts to take ha'! They have been arrested at the orders of Khan Bahadur. We don't recognize any Khan Bahadur. You must leave now. Soldiers! Arrest this insolent man. Step forward if you have guts. Moman Khan, you won't be spared today. Capture this stupid fellow. My brothers, listen to me. You are doing something that isn't right. You may save us today but the rulers will send a larger force tomorrow and destroy the village. The village will be spared if we are taken. We don't know all that. You and Taro can't be taken to certain death in front of us. O innocent ones! No one controls death. It is the eternal will of the Lord. No one sends it or stops it. What you call death isn't really death. It is a way to unite with the eternal peace. "The world is afraid of death - that death fills my mind with bliss. it is only by death that perfect, supreme bliss is obtained." Brothers, we all know Bhai Sahib. He won't agree. Save sister Taro if you can. Faujdaar Sahib, the villagers are very angry. Let Taro go if you want to be spared. Taru Singh is ready to go with you. Alright. Baapu ji, what are you doing'! Accept the God's will. Taru Singh, we are so unfortunate. We are unable to save our blessed child. Only martyrtom can extinguish the fire of brutality. The rulers are trying to shut down a kitchen of the Guru today. I urge all of you to open up your kitchens in Guru's service. Serve every needy and passerby with greater devotion and love. There is no chance of myself coming back alive from Lahore. I am leaving my mother and sister under your care. Please look after them. Vol. Sisters look foruvard to their brothers' weddings. Taro, your brother too is getting ready for a wedding today. Celebrate and sing happily. Very few people weddings like this one. Bid me a happy farewell as the tenth Guru did to his elder sons. Why are the soldiers taking Bhagatji away? Bhagatji please don't ...go... Mower, “my are “king away Bhagak. The troops of Moman Khan started from Poohla and reached Padhana at sunset. Lahore was still 25-30 miles away. Therefore they stopped over to spend the night there. They went to the village square and ordered the village chiefs to bring food. The news of Bhai Taru singh ji's arrest spread like fire in the village Some youth stealthly saw Bhai Sahib in capitivity Everyone was very worried to see a holy man like him facing certain death. Some young men cawying rods, hatchets and sickles gathered at the gurudwara of the Sixth Guru. They made a plan to attack the troops and release Bhai Sahib. But one elderly man who knew Bhai Sahib suggested that Bhai Sahib shall be consented before taking any action. The elderly person and a young man went to Bhai sahib on the pretext of serving him milk and told him about the plan. Bhai Sahib told them not to take any action. “The furnace of Zakria Khan's brutalities has to be cooled with a sacrifice. My death will uplift spirits of the Panth and wipe out tyranny. Guru Sahibs have taught us to accept Waheguru's will. Going against this does not reflect well on us. Go back and convey my love-filled greetings to all and tell them not to cause any trouble.“ The same night someone reached group of Singhs in the nearby forest and informed them about Bhai Sahib's capture. The Singhs left immediately and confronted a group of soldiers on the way to Lahore. The soldiers ran away after a skimish. But this was a different group of soldiers who were cawying treasury items. They also had some Hindu young men and women in their captivity. The Singhs took the treasury items and arranged for the safe return of Hindu men and women. But they could not rescue Bhai Taru Singh. Welivegpm I [ Libellen Weliegm fi (4 fefish You illiterate Sikh! This is neither Anandpur nor Amritsar where you greet with a Fateh. This is the court of Khan Bahadur Sahib Zakria Khan. Only a salaam is accepted here. Lakhpat Rai! Singhs have always been greeting with Fateh and will do so forever. What charges are the basis for my capture? Taru Singh, we have come to know about all of your deeds. You have been helping and sheltering the rebels. You are also the mastermind behind what happened at Patti. Harbhagat Niranjanian can produce strong evidence to prove your guilt if you refute these charges. Zakria Khan, why are you wasting time in false proceedings. Everybody knows that this court is a sham. Your phony witnesses are needed only if I lie. In front of your full court I declare that I was the hand behind what happened in Patti. The only difference is that your brutal and dishonest government sees such activities as rebellious while we see them as acts of kindness. But Singhs are rebels. They rob and plunder and you help them. Those who you call rebels, robbers and plunderers are Guru's beloved. They leave their homes and risk their lives to wipe out this cruel regime and protect the poor. Sewing such selfless daredevils is virtuous. This is what my religion teaches me. Taru Singh, you are admitting your guilt — you don't have a way out. You'll be die bearing really horrible torture. But I pity you. The door of mercy is open for you. Abandon Sikhi and adopt Islam. I will spare your life. Zakria Khan, don't Muslims die'! One who is born is bound to die. This is the unchanging law of nature. Even the bravest tremble at the sight of death. Don't you know that many Singhs have already died after suffering severe torture'! You too are going to die a horrible death unless you figure out a way to save yourself. If the Singhs before me weren't scared by your threats and torture, then why are you fooling yourself into thinking that I will get scared by your hollow threats? I'm bound to Sikhi till the end. This is my last and final reply. The hair for which you show so much love and respect, I can remove these pulled out with a severe beating with slippers. It is you who will bear the humiliating beating of slippers on your head. Those Singhs who have unwavering love for their Guru always pray that their Sikhi remains intact with unshom hair. Take away this insolent man and put him through the bone crusher.

Only the Gurmukh tells the story of the (grandeur of ) Word to the disciples (of the Guru) and never claims to tell something as his own. Deeply pondering over the Word, a Gurmukh practices Truth in his life He likes the Truth, which resides in his heart as well as speech Such a Gurmukh not only spruces his own life he rather gets the whole world across. Bhai Taru Singh Ji's martyrdom is unrivaled. He sacrificed his life out of compassion for others; remained steadfast in his beliefs and lived a true Gursikh ti|| the last breath. The love which the Lord's servant feels for the Lord lasts forever. In my life, I sewed my Lord and Master, and as I depart, I keep Him enshrined in my consciousness. After Bhai Sahib's scalp was removed Zakria Khan ordered to throw his body in the ditch outside Lahore Fort. Some Sikhs & Hindu's of Lahore on getting a chance brought Bhai Sahib to a Dharamshala. They washed Bhai Sahib's wounds with Neem water and bandaged his head. Bhai Taru Singh refused to any further treatment and kept meditating on Gurbani and Simran. The same night Zakria Khan's urinary passage got blocked. No medicine of any Hakim- Doctor or prayers 0 f Pir-Fakirs could relieve Zakria of his pains. Then, Bhai Subeg Singh was requested to go and seek pardon from Bhai Taru Singh Ji. But Bhai Sahib was in deep meditation. Bhai Subeg Singh then approached Dal Khalsa. After listening to the whole story Khalsa Ji pronounced that no power can reverse Bhai Taru Singh Ji's words. Zakria Khan' end is near but he can pass u rine if Bhai Sahib' shoes are slapped on his head. It happened the same way. For 21 days Bhai Sahib's shoes were slapped on Zakria Khan' head and he would pass urine. On 22nd day Zakria Khan died. For 22 days Bhai Sahib remained alive in meditation without scalp. When Bhai Sahib was informed about Zakria' death he said “Guru Fateh“ to all present and left for heavenly abode.
