Princess Anju asked the girl, "How did you feel?" As if intoxicated, she answered, "I felt as if I were a little bird... "waiting for spring."” Good evening. You're here early today. Good evening, Madam. Thanks for coming so early. Are you in good shape? Yes, it's over. Women are awful, aren't they? He's been anxious to see you. Who? A middle aged, good-looking man. It seems handsome men are always insincere. What are you saying? Good evening. "About men, it's not their man's looks." "About men, it's their money that matters to them." It's not looks, okay? Don't get cheated by aman's looks. About men, money's all that matters to them. Good evening. He's your guest. I'll leave. How do you do. I'm Sodeko. Let me pour for you. I hear there was a riot in Toyama. They say it spread to Osaka. What a scary world! Is Tokyo all right? I have no idea. I'll spend my money while I'm safe. Extra! Extra! Another rice riot in Osaka! Another awful thing happened? Not through yet? Hanamaru. My ex-geisha friend, Kikue, found cooked rice in the toilet. She thought it was a waste. She ate them. That got her promoted. She's now an aristocrat's mistress and lives in a big house. So, be more thoughtful and you'll get promoted. Get promoted? Extra! The Tokyo Rice Exchange was attacked! - I'll take one. - Thank you! Let's go to bed while it's safe. You know what to do, right? ! was so sad... I just wanted to cry and cry. THE WORLD OF GEISHA Starring: JUNKO MIYASHITA NAHOMI OKA HIDEAKI EZUNO MOEKO MATSUZAWA MEIKA SERI Al YOSHINO HATSUO YAMAYA Oh, sorry. You're very kind. I like you. Go ahead. I feel like we've met before. "Don't fall for your first client." Don't fall for your first client. Decent geishas never do that. It'd be a big shame to love your first client. If you think you might fall for him, just think of him as money. Okay? Excuse me. Excuse me. It's warm. Do we need this futon? Yes. I'm bashful. I may sweat. I sweat a lot. I don't mind. Will that excite you more? I didn't mean that. Let's go half way. I'll take a little off. Good evening. I'd rather die. He didn't want me to go. I came in a hurry. I'd rather die. You're already leaving! I have no time. I'm glad we could meet at least. No. Stay longer. Just a little longer. When can we meet again? Don't go. Don't leave like this. It's hard for me too. We can't meet often. I hurried to see you. I'd rather die than be a geisha. I must hurry. If I'm late, I'll be severely punished There's always another Sunday So, let me go Let go of my sword Stop it. This is my first time with you. I'm bashful. I like it brighter. No. Keep it dim. You're mean. Don't look. Good evening. How busy I am! My body'd fall apart. That man next? What counts is your body. After going to bed, men try to appreciate your body. They're enjoying it. How naughty! But it's our line to please them. That hurts! Sorry. It's the fastest way to find a good patron. "All that matters is pussies." Men gradually begin to think so. They're lechers. But, you aren't very lovely, so... Don't drop the egg. Train yourself more. Seems I drank too much. It'll be bad for you if I take too long. Let's recreate ourselves. Isn't it too warm? No. Look. You're sweating. Here. No! I'm bashful. I'm embarrassed. Train hard. This is for your sake. Young clients always finish quickly. But some middle-aged men are so persistent, you'd rather die. Try harder! To avoid that, you should master how to move your waist. Then you can get out of hell. It's all for your sake. Creep forward! Inexperienced clients believe their women are excited too, the moment they start to move. But experienced ones won't get cheated so easily. They know the women are only pretending. Such men are smarter. "Take advantage of women's pussies." If a geisha starts to like her first client, she's a slut. A better geisha would never do that. A competition of geishas and their clients. "Don't fall for your first client.” No. Charge! Put your hand into her. Then the game's all but over. Massage her most sensitive part. Stop talking! She likes you and comes to your bed. She says she was forced to come. But that's just a geisha's pride. She tries to perform well for her first client. And the client knows it. He pulls various tricks on her. It carries her away. It's too late for her to try to act. Women are born sex maniacs. They get excited with men, any sort of men. They forget to be bashful. They gasp loudly. They often yell: "Go on! Do it more!" Their hair-dos get messed up. They want to do it until they're drained. Some clients would break their backs. At the climax, some women bite their men's tongues. I'm not lying. I heard it from a well-experienced man. He thought his geisha was a slut. He kept her off after that. Endurance is at the heart of all dirty old men. Men have to keep it up at such times. They mustn't shoot it just like that. They like to see their women writhing. A few more bottles of sake. Hanae's drunk by herself. She's losing her clients. No work today, either. I hate to say this. But she's too greedy now. She's lost her human emotions. Don't end up like her. It's not easy to work as a geisha. But she mustn't go too far. This is between us: Her patron hasn't come to her lately because she's like that. “I'm coming! I'm coming!” I'm ashamed. I got so excited with a new client. I've never done this before. What's wrong? Do something. I can't get that tissue. Never mind. Let's stay like this. But... You're a little too heavy. Sorry. August 1918 - Rice riot breaks out Know what's happening to Japan? You too. Do you know? Ass! You too! What's wrong? Get up. I'm shy. My dear... "You want more, don't you?" Men don't understand why women like it so much. While watching women in ecstasy, a man wanted to know how women felt at times like that. He heard it was like being strangled. Listen, Buffoon. Didn't you say you wouldn't mind dying for me? Yes, I did. Actually, you're supporting my family and me. We owe you a lot. Then try it. Try what? How women feel. Try to know it. Are you saying for me to hang myself? Yes, I am. I want you to help me to know how women feel. I wasn't talking about myself. I've never thought of trying to know how women feel myself. I want to know. I'll be more than happy to know how women feel. If you're dying, make a sign with your hands or feet. Then I'll help you. A sign? But I might die. Isn't it ticklish? No. What about you? Men feel ticklish after that, don't they? Not necessarily. Ing! I'm coming agant" "I'm coming! I'm I get a great view from here. Take a look at yourself. No, please. March 1920 - Communist Revolution in Russia ll am a buffoon. My family would be glad to know I'd died for my patron. Who am I to want to die... just to know how women feel? Out of the mouth comes foolishness. I was careless. But you're cruel to make use of it. For you, I may be nobody. But I'm still a human. Sometimes I bear grudges. Remember that. Help me as soon as I kick my legs. Right away. If 1 die, I'll haunt you. Don't be upset. It's too soon. Sit down. Mister! Banzai Incident You all right, Buffoon? Don't die. Move aside. How was it? Damn you! Murderer! "1 thought I'd been foolish.” I said so to the King of Hell. He said... I wasn't even worthy of going to hell. "1917 - March Revolution in Russia" "1917 - November Revolution in Russia" Good evening, Madam. - They're waiting. - Thank you. Good evening. Thank you. Good evening. - Finally! - We've been expecting you. You're going to feel really hot soon. Excuse me. Way to go, woman! A spring bamboo shoot! Just as the way she was born! What a view! See the mountain! Are you ready? - Amazing! - Really amazing. Watch how skilfully I drop the coins! The best show around! One, two, three, four, five. Cherry blossoms scattering! How silly! I'm going to bed. Make beds for me. But we may still have to work. Who cares? I hear riots are everywhere. It's the depression. We're in the dark. Just do as you're told. What if someone wants us to come? A girl once said When I first slept with a man It hurt like I was stabbed with a dagger You go to bed too. It's too soon. Let's call it a day. You be a courtesan. And I'll be your customer. Let's play. Let me undress you. How old are you? Seventeen. Seventeen? Are you a virgin? Are you really a virgin? Nothing happened to you yet? Excuse me? I mean men. I've had none. Didn't anything like that song happen? It's like eating peppers It's so hot but real nice Think of me as your client. But... Be reasonable. Try to master what to do with men. I'll teach you. Extra! Extra! Another rice riot in Kobe! - Give me one. - Thank you. Come. I'm your client. Put your legs in first. Don't test my patience. Put your knees together. Put in your legs first. Do it slowly. Come closer. Are you afraid? Train yourself. Or your clients won't like you. You really are a virgin. You have such nice, soft skin. You awake? I fell asleep somehow. I'm shy. Don't look. No need to be shy. I don't know... what's happened to me. You teasing me? You started this. I'm shy. Don't say anything. You started all this. Did you enjoy it too? Yeah. I enjoyed it. You're teasing me again. No. I'm being honest. You're always cunning. Listen... Did you do it to the end? I wonder. Couldn't you tell? You made me hot, not yourself. Think so? You made me crazy. But you stayed calm. What a man! You're really cunning. Awful. How awful. It's no good, eh? You can make it. Can make what? You have to finish it too. Only I got hot. I'm ashamed. What is your patron like? You have one, right? Shut up. Talk. He died. I have no patron now. I see. He was old, wasn't he? What makes you think so? I was right, huh? Yes. But how did you know? The way you do it. Naughty! It seems you're really tired. Can I make it? Yes, you can. You're the loveliest woman... and the best technician I've ever met. I wonder what sort of experience has done this. "He saw her so often, he decided to marry her..." Come. What is it? The Osaka Police Dept. sent us a notice at midnight on the 15th: Not to place any articles about rice riots in newspapers for a while. So, you must keep it to yourself. I'd like to try something new. Like what? Come with me. What is it? Can't you guess? Don't tell me! You hit it. In a place like this? No! Come on. Can't you control yourself? Darling... You'll leave her, won't you? Who? You're pretending. You have a woman to run a geisha house. I don't love her anymore. I'll leave her. So... Are you serious? Someone might come. Who cares? No. We aren't dogs. What's wrong with acting like dogs? I'll do it from behind SO grass won't get in you. Grass? How awful. "Wives are like home-cooked meals. "But a quick snack outside the home now and then spices up the menu. "Wives should understand that and not get jealous." It's getting cold. Pull down the hood. A tip. In return, keep running, all right? No. The rickshaw man's there. You in the rickshaw. I know you're in there. I've checked on you. I'm Hanae. Awful woman. At a time like this! You got married? Congratulations! I really mean it. It's true I was mad, but I'm just a geisha too. I knew I was just your toy. I don't hold it against you. But, I have something to tell you. Stop the rickshaw and listen. What shall we do? Keep running. I don't want to stop now. Never mind her. Run at full speed! Catch up with it! "She was from a poor family. "She had to be either a geisha or a factory worker at age 15 or 16. "Just like the others, she was sold to a geisha house and became a slave." Mister! I know. You're making a fool of me. All right! I'm pregnant. You're the father. When my child is born, I'll tell him that his father was a devil. Good evening. Good evening. I'm a sloth. I'll give you that place. I'll pay the cost of bringing up my child too. Extra! Extra! It's Siberia! "August 1918 - Dispatch of Troops to Siberia" I have you and another one. I think I've heard that. Men are awful, aren't they? After all, they end up like that. Sex maniacs! It's a man's dream. But you're just married. This is something different. Okay this evening? If you pay. It's my line of business. You understand? You're a real pro. Two women together? Maybe three next time. I don't think about the future. Where do you think you'll end up? I'm sure you'll end up in hell. I'll go first. I have a date at your place. Good-bye. "Destination: Erotic hell" Hello. Good evening. It's still daytime. Sorry. You look happy, Madam. Don't tease me. A soldier's waiting. "A soldier"? He was my fiancé. Okay, then. Hello. You're early. In the daytime? They're naughty. We'll compete with them. You sure? You haven't had me lately. Aren't you with that geisha? What's the point? You are, right? Knock it off. Here for your sense of guilt? That's enough, ass! I'm being sent to Siberia. Siberia in Russia? When? Right away. So soon? When will you be back? How should I know? I'm going to war. You should've told me. If you'd told me, I'd have come here straight. It was foolish. I had to listen to boring stories. I had to stay with a sex maniac. Can you stay? No. Time's running out. Please! How long can you stay? Five minutes. Only five minutes? What a shame! They're already starting. I'm amazed at today's young geishas. She's crying. I don't think so. You sure? Let's do it too. No. Maybe this is our last time. Maybe we can't do it anymore. You're talking like I'll die. We promised to buy farmland and live together. That promise kept me going. I know. Take care of yourself. Seems you were right. You see? What a jerry-built house! Hey! No. Please! Not at your age. Age doesn't matter. Please don't die. Don't flirt with Russian women. Be sure to come back. My hairs. Take them with you. They'll protect you from bullets. Keep them. I'll protect you. I must hurry, or I'll be shot to death. Snap it up. Someone may come. I'll go part way with him. You! An Imperial Army soldier running with a geisha? - Now, go! - Good afternoon. Hello? Who is it? You surprised me. You're like a ghost. What's up? Come inside. Thank you. I want to talk to you. About what? Why so formal? Will you find me someone to make a woman of me? What's that? Why all of a sudden? You're wrong to say that to me. Why not talk to Hanae? She's awful. I want to get out of her place. But I'm in her debt. I need someone to be my patron.
