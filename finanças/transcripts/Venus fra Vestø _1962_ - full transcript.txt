That's Vetoe. We dock in ten minutes. Vogel, you know your orders. Yes, sir. The fuhrer orders that the we treat them with respect. The populace...not the conquered. We are not at war with Denmark. The inhabitants will be suspicious, but it is our duty to win them over. And not by force, but with patience. Understand! - Grandfather, then the Germans are here. - Here I come. - What do they want here on our peaceful island? - Yes, they're just stubborn. The Press radio news. Today, July 10, 1940, the German... - Muller, let the men enter. - Enter and wear the cap. Who is the top here on Vestoe? Ole Klausen. I am parish council chairman. - Do you speak German? - No, but I understand it. Good. Vesto is from today controlled by the German Wehrmacht. The German commander in Copenhagen declares: - Muller, read the main points in Danish. - Yes sir, Hoffman. Vestoe's residents have to stay indoors from 9 pm to 6 am. No ships are allowed to leave the harbor or any other places on the island. All firearms must be surrendered, all liquor will be impounded, - - and all alcoholic beverages are prohibited. Besides the people are not to eavesdrop on English radio. All the rest of the crew sets in and is quartered on Egedlund. At Egedlund? Impossible. Dear Mr. Klausen. I am not dictating with you or anyone else. But I expect everyone to follow, - - so the relationship with the German armed forces goes smoothly. The war is not a joke. The fuhrer wants a good relationship with the beaten countries. Only when England is defeated is the war over, - - and your Fuhrer have not conquered England yet. It's only a matter of time. And now, please show us the way to Egedlund. - Does anyone live here? - No. - Who does it belong to? - The Eged Schack family. I need two rooms. A bedroom and a working room. I'll make sure a few rooms are prepared upstairs. What's down here? The dining room. The passage over to the servants' wing. - And in here? - It's the library. May I see it? Magnificent. An excellent working environment. The captain please find another place to work. These were dead private rooms. The landowner meant a lot to us all. - Ms. Nicola won't like it, either. - Who? Ms. Nicola is the daughter. - Is it perhaps Miss Nicola? - Yes. Adorable...very adorable. Does she live alone at the parent estate? No, Ms. Nicola still lives in England. - Oh? With the enemy. - On the contrary, Mr. Captain. She believed that she benefited the country better from abroad than at home. Is there no one left of the other family? No, yes, a cousin of Ms. Nichola's. He has a cottage nearby. Why didn't he follow his cousin's example - - about performing stupid feats in foreign countries? Mr. Ditlev doesn't have the same idea as ​​her. This Mr. Ditlev must be a reasonable man. I want to talk to him. Ask him to come. I don't think he is home. At this time, he is at the lighthouse. He paints. He is an art painter. Painter? So one might not want to disturb him at work? Anyway, tell him I'll be waiting for him here at 3 o'clock. It is not certain he wishes to come. Do not want? Then I usually send my NCO Vogel. You take him along. Should I arrange the workspace in the library? Set up the dining room as my office. The library will remain untouched. Yes sir, Herr Hauptmann. That was a wise move, Captain. So do I. There are a few things we must talk about. Hello! - Are you Ditlev Eged-Schack? - Yes it is me. Didn't Mr. Klausen inform you to come at 3 o'clock? - Yes, he said that. - It's over 4. Listen here. Your commander stays here at least for a few days. I don't know his plans. Say hello to the commander and tell him I'll be with him in an hour and a half. In Poland, you were shot for this. Murder, whether in Poland or here, fixes no problem. Murder is a mental and intellectual declaration of bankruptcy, if only... - (there is a knock on the door) - Yes. Herr Hauptmann. Ditlev Eged-Schack. - Welcome. - Excuse me, I'll come so late. Rude of me. Just talk danish. I speak it badly, but I understand it pretty well. Thanks, that makes it a bit easier for me. - Have you fallen? - I tripped. While I waited for you, I looked through your blue book. It was very interesting. They were born in 1910 to the only son of Major General Eged-Schack, - - commander of the 1st degree and medal of merit in gold. At 17, you became a student with distinction. Then they spent 5 years in Copenhagen - - and in Oxford in England. And I'm the black sheep of the family. I gather you didn't get that. And what were you studying? Human rights from ancient times to the present day. - Are you a communist? - No... Are you? No... A cigarette? No thanks. And your hobby is painting. Do you have other interests? Music, good books, football. What does a man with so fine versatile interests - - do at Vestoe? - Firstly; I have a little house over here. - And secondly? Since you ask. I don't like uniforms. Nor yours... Sorry. - And there are no other reasons? - No. As the son of a high-ranking officer, your innocence is questionable. I will guess at a third reason. There is talk of a starting underground movement in Denmark. What do you say to that idea? They think I'm a saboteur or a 5th column man? I don't know what to believe. You know what you should. Go home with me and see my collection of fake beard and bombs. Don't make fun of me. Neither do I. I hate war. I came here to have peace, I had that until 1/2 hour ago. Mr. Eged-Schack, maybe I'm naive. But I believe you. However, not that you have accidentally damaged your mouth. That is nothing. I could have been more careful. It was a pleasure to meet you, - - and I hope that you will continue to concentrate only on painting. Vogel! Herr Hauptmann. Come here. What happened to mr. Eged-Chack? Did they hit him? - Herr Hauptmann... - Yes, or no? - Yes, Herr Hauptmann. - And why? He became fresh, and then I smacked him one. Rather I would strike you, too. Stupidity and brutality weaken the Wahrmacht. If it repeats itself, I'll send you off to forced labour, understand? - Yes, Herr Hauptmann. - Out. For His Majesty the king, his house and Vestoe, cheers. Yes, the German captain told us, we have to turn in our guns. We get over that easily, because we don't have anyone. He asked me to say that you must roll down the curtains in the evening. And that you must do. I have promised that. Then we cannot listen to English radio. What does that do? The German's don't like we hear the matter from the other side. Turn it down when you take London. Otherwise we must conform us, as well as we can, everyone... It probably won't last long. And the thing with liqour? There I turn to you, Pive-Ras. As your old freind, you are a good man. You know how you are, when the thirst catches you, don't you? Preferrably, there shouldn't occur something bad on the island, right? Let it be the tea you drink until the war is over - - and Ms. Nicola has returned to us again. Give me your hand on that. ... Thank you, Ras. Is there anything you want to know? How is he, the German captain? I think he is honest. If he didn't wear that uniform, - - yes, then I think he could have become our friend. (the clock strikes 9) - Good morning, Cathy. - Good morning, Uncle George. - Sorry... After you, sir. - Go on, Radnor, Good morning, Tom. Good morning, Cathy. Have you been true to me? I didn't even look at another man. - The ordinary? - Yes, please. Good morning, mr. Carruther. - Can I talk to you, sir? - Oh, Radner! Cant you see, In the middle of my lunch. Everything in time. The time is now. The place is a small island of the coast of by Denmark; Vestoe. - Which one? - A little danish island called Vestoe. Can't you see you're interrupting me in my lunch? - It is very important... - I don't know that place. What if another small spot in Europe is occupied? It's due to Venus. They remember Venus right? Venus is the love goddess. It is important and it's urgent. Possibly, but we can't discuss it here. Goodbye, Tom. Who was that officer? - Uncle George, Sir. - Your uncle? No, we call him that, he works in the Ministry of War. We're going to the ministry. There we can talk privately. MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES I'm just getting the file, Sir. Come in. Well, now... Would you perhaps explain it to me? Here she is in her own high glory. Isn't she beautiful? After all, it's a cow. A magnificent example of a Jersey brred. She visited England nine months ago. I hope she enjoyed herself. She had a meeting with Mars of Ippworth. Our distinguished premium. After the ceremony, Venus was returned to Vestoe. - And Vestoe is on German hands... - Precisely, Sir. Venus and her unborn calf are Hitler's prisoners. An unpleasant thought. Single... and expectant mother. And the calf? The calf, which has to carry on the story, is irrepressible. You couldn't persuade our old friend Mars to... I mean there must be other cows? - Yes, but there was only one Mars. - Was? On the same day, if the ceremony with Venus took place, - - stepped Mars on a land mine. He is no longer among us. Who wrote: Death is the end of any love affair. - Radnor, what are we talking about? - About the calf, Sir. Or rather about Venus from Vetoe. She belongs to the free world. She gives birth to a calf in England. - What do you want to do? - If I were you, I would do everything. I would even go to the king. Radnor? May I remind you of some of our problems right now? We have just rescued the remnants of our army home from the continent. We are expecting an attack to land, or sea, or from the air. London can be bombed all the time. Yes, but what? I ask you to be the agent from another point of view? - Yes. - How do I call it... But in these uncertain times - - Venus and her unborn calf stand for stability and continuity. She is the guarantee that we in Britain - - can breed cattle of the world with noble burden. I urge you to save them both. If Venus doesn't give birth to a calf, the lineage dies. She's going to give birth to a bull calf, right? That's right, sir. And Venus is going to have a bull calf. - You know that too? - I want to bet everything I own. Are you asking me to go to the highest authorities over a cow? It's not just a cow. It's history. Give me 10 Downing Street. The Prime Minister. Now coms Kritoffer. He can better answer your questions. How old is the cow? Venus is 3 years, 11 months and 10 days. A magnificent specimen. The beautiful chest and the straight legs. In Germany I'm a farmer. You understand cows. Kritoffer, get me the cow lineage board - - and the milk production with fat content and quantity. - What a year, right? - Yeah... It can only be of interest to us here on the island. It will also interest in Germany. Captain. Do you understand that the cow here is loved by everyone? Its calf can have meaning for us. Can you ask... Not ask. As a farmer, I understand you, - - but as a German officer, I can't. Let's look at the other cows. He wants to take you to Germany. But he won't be allowed to. (air alarm) (firing) - (there is a knock on the door) - Come in. Good morning, Sir. - A lively night, huh? - It was rather noisy. They really got it in the Eat End. We haven't had you for long. - Have you been on leave of absence? - Three weeks in the sun. It sounds good. Good morning, Sir. (the phone is ringing) Major John Morland? It is the Ministry of War. Uncle George wants to talk to you. - Hello, John. - Good morning, Uncle George. - When did you come back? - Last night... just in time for the fireworks. - Is everything OK? - Yes, everything is fine. - I have a new job for you. - Another? - Yes, one more. - Anything like the last one? Not at all, but one that will appeal to your Scandinavian sense of humor. - Come up here at 11. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Uncle George. - (knocking) - Come in. - Good morning, Uncle George. - Good morning. Nice to see you. Take a seat. I have a something urgent. But in the meanwhile read this nonsense. Welcome home from Lisbon. Did you liquidate our little friend? A hated the job from beginning to end. A disgusting job... Well, well... a walk in London, in the East End, through smoke, rubble and ruins. Then are you done feeling for a little Getapo ticker. - What do you think about that? - It appeals to me a lot. A bit of sanity in the European crazy population. That paper means I have to launch a military operation - - to save a cursed cow from a little Danish island. - Do you want the job? - With the greatest of pleasure. Good. You know why I chose you right? Probably because of my Danish mother or my bad English? A bit of everything. Do you speak Danish now? - I hope so. - Say something in Danish now. - You stupid swine. - What does it mean? - I love you. - You see... you love me? It was neat, mind you. Good, what help do you want? Brought and promoted a skilled radio telegraphist. We have him: Henriken, private in the Black Watch in Edinburgh. And of course all I can get of information about Vetoe. The intelligence service has turned up a woman, - - who is born and raised on the island. - When will you introduce me? - She works in ATS in North Wales. You can meet her this afternoon. - Well, an old heron. - Yes, she's not. - Do you want money? - No, for what? You could buy a milking chair and a straw to suck on. And I had a real men's job for you. Matilda... call the commander of the ATS in Wales. - The secret phone, please. - Excuse me. Nicola Eged-Schack? I didn't know you had those good connections. I have just spoken to the War Department. They must stop immediately. They call with a plane in 20 minutes. They can contact you at room 057. ... and in conclusion ... ... Dear servants. - (there is a knock on the door) - Come in... Good day, John. - Is it going well with the marine? - Both yes and no. I asked them to find someone who knows the waters around Vestoe. A Danish seaman lives here, who stayed here when Denmark was occupied. - Lucky. - Yes, if I could find him. He is not been seen for several days. He paints the town red... Can't he leave it to Hitler? What is your friend called? Jacobsen. They call him Trawler-Jack. He weighs 100 kg and has a full black beard. The beard can be useful. Matilda, grab Scotland Yard. Search him. Describe the man - - and tell them to trace him with immediate urgency. If he survived yesterday's airstrike, they will find him. - (there is a knock on the door) - Come in. Hello. May I ask who you are? Nicola Eged-Schack. I'm reporting in from Wales. - Of course. They are the girl from Vestoe. - Yes, sir. - Have you been assigned a car? - Yes, sir. Major Morland... you need to drive him until further notice. - Wait at the main entrance in five minutes. - Yes, sir. Don't call me Sir. My name is Uncle George here. - Excellent... Uncle George. - Thank you for coming. My goodness, and we called her an old heron. Was she pretty? They are all look alike in the ugly uniform. My dear chap... If I thought you believed that, - - would I be nervous for the human race. - See you sometime, Uncle George. - Yes... Goodbye, John. - Is the major Danish? - No, my mother is Danish. - Have you been to Denmark? - Yes, several times. - They are from Vetoe. - Yes, do you know it? - No, I would like to hear about it. - There is not much to tell. It is small, from the sea it looks uninhabited. - They know it inside and out? - Yes, I know it by heart. My cousin and I sailed in a small boat to see the end of the island. They are very tall. Can you come ashore without using the port? Yes, on the north side. The fishermen pulled their boats up there in the old days. Now we shall turn left here for the first time. - (knocking) - Yes. Good afternoon, Sir. My name is John Morland. Yes, Uncle George told me about you. We have all the information you want. Will you leave for a moment? Suan... do we have to learn our little master piece. This is Vestoe in Denmark. Goodness, I say. You have done well. This is splendid. It is made for the little lady... Your cow. She lives here... at Egedlund. Your signature, Herr Hauptmann. They have sent for me. Yes... Come closer. - How is it going with the painting? - Dirty. Not good? To do something right you have to feel freedom. It's a little tricky here. Are you not satisfied with me? We are here to protect Denmark. - Not to bother people. - That's very nice of you. Be sure and take a seat. It will perhaps surprise you to hear that I have let you follow. Why? Why... Because I didn't completely believe you. But now I know you are who you say you are. That's why I commissioned this pass note for you. So you are free to paint where you want. No one will stop you. It's nice of you, but it has no interest. - Why not? - Yes, if you gave everyone one like that. I don't want any advantages over anyone else on the island. I'm sorry, Weiss, but it can't be any other way. Auf Wiedersehen. Sorry it took a while. I need to go back to the Ministry of War. Mooh. Stop. It's the War Department, not a cowshed. I almost feel like I was born at Vestoe. And I think there is more than one Venus on Vestoe. Private Nicola knows Vestoe inside out. - Not surprised. Any idea who she is? - Not in the sleightest. You move in the highest circles. Nicola is the youngest member of an old noble family, - - who has been lords of the island for 300 years. - Maybe she knows Venus, too. - She owns her. - Quite a family business, huh? - Yes, where is she now? At the hotel changing. We're going to eat together tonight. Yeah? Then they don't all look the same in the ugly uniform. Tell her the whole story tonight ... in the candle light. - News about my radio telegraph? - Henriksen? Not yet. Matilda, what did Edinburgh say? When I called, his entire company was out marching. They should be back at 5. - Matilda... the time IS 5. - Oh sorry. The Scottish command, please. - Corporal Henriken is here. - Excellent. Send him in. Corporal Henriken, fast march. - Corporal Henriken... - Excuse me, Sir. An unusual order summons you to the Ministry of War, room 057. - Do you know what it is? - Not at all, Sir. I hate to send a good man to London to lick stamps. - That was all. Good luck. - Thank you, Sir. Continue, Mr. Sergeant. Sorry, I'm a bit late. - I call that a transformation. - Battle dress number 2. What do you think? They look like what they are: the Princess of Vestoe. - You could have told me that. - They didn't ask. Do you know a fisher from Vestoe, Jacoben... Trawler-Jack. - Yes, I do. - Tell me a little about him. He is a jovial guy and the lovability itself. He has incredible knowledge of our waters. If I ask why you are interested in him, - - then you are changing the subject? - Mr. Major, there is a telephone. - Thanks. Excuse me. John? ... Uncle George here. - We have found Jacoben. - Well. It turns out that if he came to London for booze, - - Scotland Yard combed London to find him. So pick him up at Bow Street Police Court tomorrow. Alright, I'll be there. How is it with our little friend? - Do you show your charm? - I'll do my best. Get on with it. See you tomorrow. So there was no more tonight. You may go. - Good night, Uncle George. - Good night, Matilda. - Don't talk to strange gentlemen. - Uncle George... This is London. BBC broadcasts to Denmark. Hitler has hailed troops for the victory over France - - and threatened Churchill to exterminate England. German bombers have attacked a town in Scotland and... (there's a knock on the door) Come in. - Are your husband at home? - Yes, go ahead. - Good evening, Mr. Klausen. - Good evening. - Something new? - Well... We don't know anything new other than what you tell us. I have a favor for you. A platoon of special troops comes here to practice landing. In that time, unfortunately, we are extending the curfew. So people must stay inside from dawn until morning. I will announce it all over the island. Any trespassers will be punished. I have to go. Have a good night. I have today received notice of, - - that Venus from Vestoe ends up in Germany. They get paid in Reichmarks, - - into Miss Eged-Schack's account. She doesn't need German Mark. She won't like Venus going to Germany. But, Mr. Klausen, the matter is settled. In that case, you should prepare for there to be unrest here. The population will not agree that you are stealing Venus. Which? Did you say 'steal?' Sorry, but that was the first word that came to mind. But I repeat if they send Venus away from here, the island will fight back. Will the little Vestoe repel? The little flea against the elephant. Ridiculous. We have an old saying that says: Have patience, fleas. The night is long. Yes? - A lovely evening. - Yes. (airplanes are heard) Our air force is on its way to London. Sad, the English are so stubborn. I believe you, Mr. Captain. I also think it will hurt you even more later. Yes, here is the sweetheart... Vera Lynn. Wish m luck as you wave me goodbye cherio, here I go on my way (the sound of airplanes) wish me luck as you wave me goodbye with a cheer, not a tear, make it gay give me a smile I can keep all the while in my heart while I'm away till we meet once again you and I wish me luck as you wave me goodbye although I'm going on my way don't be so sad of heart keep this lovely moment as a memory apart and before I go please whisper soft and low just once for me to hear the words I love you, dear wish me luck as you wave me goodbye chario, here I go on my way wish me luck as you wave me goodbye with a cheer, not a tear make it gay give me a smile I can keep all the while in my heart while I'm away till we meet once again you and I wish me luck as you wave me goodbye. (bombing) Ladies and gentlemen. We have to go down the shelter. Excuse me, but this is my first airstrike. Look, Nicola... It's okay if I call you by your first name? - Of course not. - John. Now I want to tell you a story. A true story. Or rather... it becomes true. We call that operation Venus... Good morning, my lord. Your early morning tea. What is it? Aspirin. It helps the head. And here, you better clean yourself up a bit. They must go to court before His Highness at 10... My lord. You can be yourself. Silence in court. Your name is Morten Jacoben. Are you Danish? - Yes, sir. - Your job? For now nothing, but usually fisher. They are accused of disorderly conduct and violence on an officer. Do you plead guilty? You have been charged for pub disorder and violence against an officer. Are you guilty? - Yes, sir. - How old are you? - How old are they? - 37, Your high honerly. Accused claims he is 37 but he is 61. A mitigating circumstance. Fined 10 shillings. Thousands thank you, your high honrary. Next case. - Trawler... - Ms. Nichola. - Well, You recognize me. - Of course, I can. I pulled out a fishing hook from your ass. You were only 6 years old. - Don't you need a beer? - Yes, prefferably two. Then come with us. There is something we want to talk to you about. Well, now have you got the whole history... I think. John, here are your orders. Read them, memorize them and burn them. Any questions? Should I pilot the boat through the minefield? You will find out from the navy. - What's my calling signal? - You'll get it from the telegram. We'll get there in a sub and come back in a torpedo boat. - We? - They don't go to Vestoe without me. - Yeah. - Then it cannot be carried out. You don't know the island, and it doesn't know you. You want Venus with you, They must have help from the population. - We are not much for strangers. - But that is out of the question. - What are you talking about? - Nicola wants to go to Vestoe. I have done nothing but cook and scrub. Now I can accomplish something real. - It's against the rules. - Forget it. I make my own. And that has always been my opinion. - Good, an order is an order. - So let's look at the model. - Do you want to explain, John? - Yes. We board the submarine at 1800 tomorrow evening. We arrive at Red Rock at 0030 the following night. 24 hours later we pick up from a MTB. It will again at high tide at 0016. It's correct, isn't it? At high tide at 0016. At about 0016. Now don't come too late, for heaven's sake. - Other questions? - No. All that remains; I wish you luck and keep your feet dry. Thanks. It is now me who should salute you. Well, hare we are. Pericope down. Take her up. Ready to surface. - Nervous? - That's not the word. Excuse me. What is the next point? They'll show the way to Egedlund. But walk quietly, there may be watchposts. - And when that happens? - Bob and I will arrange that. (a dog barks) - Where now? - The country road is over there. - Are there any other options? - Past Serinsen's farm. They sleep. There is Egedlund. There is a guard. - Where is the stables? - Just over there to the right. Come on! (the door creaks) Stop... Who there? Good night... Heil Hitler! Hail Hitler! The embittered hook. I should have remembered it. There she is. Good day again, Venus. We have come to get you. (horn sounds) - Good morning. Slept well? - Yes please. What are they doing? - Getting ready to end up in London. - A sandwich? - It is there. - To Uncle George from John. Have contacted Venus ... whom is in progress. (a door creaks) It's just Kritoffer. I go down and talk to him. - Good morning, Kritoffer. - Miss Nicola. Someone is coming! - Good morning, Kritoffer. - Good morning, Captain Weiss. How are you, my little cat? You look radiant. Healthy and free. When will the little calf come? It will undoubtedly be a bull. Are you staring? Crush on me? Do I have pigtails? No, Captain, I have seen none. Nothing. - Drunk too much last night? - Yes. Put Venus out so I can see her from my window. Are you going to give birth soon? I have a cramp in my foot. - Is there anybody? - No. It was close. Are they there? So we continue. Just heard about the prima donna's silly abduction for Da Reich. Must do what we can to prevent it. Stop. Please send £5 to local cat shelter. We must get further in the text. Get over to the chairman of the parish council. - How long will it last? - 3 quarters. Well. In exactly 60 minutes, you will be here. With what info you gathered, then we draw up the plan in every detail. If one gets in trouble, the other two continue. Nicola, You won't get into trouble. It is an order. Sweet girl. I would like to be with her in more pleasant circumstances. I would too Under all circumstances. Yes, thanks. Goodbye. Miss Nicola! Miss Nicola... Come, come in. - What is it? - 7 minutes past. They arrive 7 minutes too late. Did you get anything out of it? Yes, we can safely count on the whole island. We have 300 allies. And the Germans... where do we have to pay attention? Take the map. There's a lookout post there, and one here and over there. It's a miracle, no one was at Red Rock yesterday. There is a garrison at 40 men under the command of Captain Weiss. So are there special troops ashore, about to train in landing. - Landing? Where? - Let them remain in the faith! In the harbor is a German gunboat called 'Lubeck.' It is very fast and armed to the teeth. - It wasn't so good. - No. It was pretty bad. We forget about the ship and wonder if it didn't exist. You cut the telephone lines to headquarters. I go to Mermaid Bay and arrange the fireworks. Exactly at 1 we meet here again. How will you spend the morning? Klausen and I figured something out. So that we can get Venus away from upper meadow. I told about my cousin Ditlev. He can help if he wants. Nichola... Hands up. I saw you last night. You went through our farm, I didn't sleep. - Shame, should've been more cautious. I take my hands down? - Yes, but no numbers. No, no. What's your name? Why should I tell? What are they called? - Why should I tell? - Because I have the gun. My name is John Morland. - Shall I tell you something? - Yes, thanks. You friends up in the blackberry thicket are smarter than you are. The Germans don't go up there. They do here. - I can't see anyone. - They go down there to bathe. - Then I better get off. - Yes, you'd better hurry. They are coming now! - Can I get away another way? - Drop the clothes and go into the water! - What about the backpack? - I'll fix it. Swim behind that thing over there. I'll wait for you there. You know you can't stay at the beach. What are you doing here? - I'm waiting for the english. - (the German laughs) - Who is that man down there? - Oh, him! - It's just an English spy. - You are a smart ass. It sounds absolutely insane. You have come to collect a cow. It is all planned in every detail. But Weiss has been so happy for Venus that it is under always watch. This is where you come into the picture. You must help us. I'm sorry, but I don't want to get involved in anything with war, not even you can get me to. You won't! The only thing you need to do is to paint a cow so it looks like Venus. An outstanding job for a visual artist. I know when the captain eats lunch. I'll switch the cows then. Then we hide the real Venus here till darkness. Tonight we will be picked up by a motor torpedo boat at 0016. Are you happy to be home again? Very. No matter what happens. And I am... very happy to be you again. Let me see, what have I got? Ochre, ivory white, burnt iena... - You want to do it? - Yes. For your sake and for old England's sake. - You swim really well. - Happy you think so. Can I have my clothes. - This is going to be between us, right? - Yes, you think I'm an idiot? No, but the Germans could find out that you helped me. - They don't get a word out of me. - You don't know them. - Perhaps you want to come to England. - Wow, can I!? Nichola will talk to your parents. If you're going, you will meet us tonight at 12 at Red Rock. If something happens, you run home and leave nothing behind. May I bring my gun? Yes, if you promise not to kill with it. John Morland... God save the King. ... in Congratulations, in Congratulations there Gemutlichkeit. Eins, zwi, dri... Cheers! I come later with the red trouts. You look tired. Come and get a glass. No thanks. I'm not thirsty. Come over here. I want to talk with you. I invite you to a glass. You can't say no to a German soldier. - Bring a glass. - You forget what you promised. Bring a glass. I would like to drink a glass of lemonade with the German gentleman. Thanks for the gift. That was kind of you. (everyone laughs) - Have you spoken to your cousin? - It's alright. What I thought, Mr. Ditlev will not fail us. He is one of us. See... that's the one I meant. - It's Hyasint, isn't it? - Yes, she is a fine cow. - Is Mrs. Larsen at home? - She's out in the kitchen. Keep her stalled with chat, then I'll attempt as a cattle thief. Then we meet later as agreed. Pay! Come with the bottle, dammit, but hurry! Nah, not that crap! That! Oh! What is it? Come and get one instead of standing there ogling! Pour! Pour to the whole lot! It's me who buys! Because do you know what kind of day it is? It is a lovely day. Raise your glass, you german dogs, and drink a cheers for Ms Nicola, - - who came back home. Do you get what I'm saying? She has come home from England. I saw her myself! The war is over. We can drink again. - Goodbye, Mrs. Larsen. - Goodbye. Klaus! Whiny-Ras is blasted, he stands and toasts that the war is over, - - and that Ms. Nicola has come home and he saw her. - Is there anyone else in there? - Germans. Some understand Danish. (all sings along) - No, we have... - I want to talk to you. - Have you heard the big news? - No, you're wrong. - No, now you have to listen... - Come outside. Dammit! It's bloody true. I saw her fully sprinkling alive. - You saw nothing, nothing at all. - She had Hyasint with her. - Come in here. - It's true what I'm saying... In 5 seconds. - Then he is there - To Uncle George from John. All good with all four. Repeater: All four. Have to inform speeding, heavily armed German canon boat, - - located in the harbor. Stop. Also prima donna's condition disturbing. Stop. Suggests that man with black bag receives us at the gangway. Listening at 15 after further orders or goodbye. Finish. - (knocking) - Come in. Thank you. - Message from Major Morland? - Yes, do you want to read it? 'Send further orders or goodbye.' What a pitty. I'll call Portmouth for you. Matilda, why do you want to call Portmouth? - So They can cancel the collection. - How long have you worked here? Long enough to know that you are not sacrificing a fully staffed MTB - - for two men, a woman and a cow. Correct. Have you read Kipling's 'Stilk & Co.?' No... 'The kid calls the tiger.' Does that mean something to you? Well... The cow's roaring is egging the canon boat. Does this mean anything to you? Did you know "Lubeck" was harbored over there? Yes. She is the most modern ship of the German navy. Fast-moving, well-equipped and ended up in Vestoe for testing. With a little help, we'll give the Germans something to wonder about. - Take a block. - Yes, Uncle George. I will send out a signal to John Morland. Message begins; To John from Uncle George. Don't be such a great idiot. Stop. Operation Venus continues as planned. Finish. - Send it in code as soon as possible. - Yes, Uncle George. 'Or goodbye.' Who the hell does he think I am? Yes, Mr. Colonel. But shouldn't we await better weather? There is high tide Today. Of course not, Mr. Obert. Yes, Mr. Colonel. The order is executed. Hail Hitler. Berlin immediately demands the remains of Venus. Tell Kritoffer to pull the cow to the harbor at 5:30 p.m. She leaves at 6 p.m. Herr Hauptmann, I request a short speech. - Something important? - I think so, Herr Hauptmann. - It is about a young girl. - A girl? - Saw her this morning. - Why are you telling me that? Because it can hang together with something that happened in the inn. We were there when an elderly man came rushing in, - got a lot to drink and yelled: "The war is over." He was sure, because he had seen a young girl, - - who had come from England. He called her Miss Nicola. - Why am I hearing it now? - The man was drunk. - Will you be able to recognize the girl? - Yes, she was very sweet. Come with me. - Is it her? - Yes. Where is the drunk? Grab him. The parish council chairman took him out. Herr Hauptmann, the man has been found. His name is Pive-Ras. - He is in the valley behind the inn. - Get him. He can barely say something. He got struck down. Instantaneous alarm response. All guards alert on the double. Carry out a house inspection when the curfew comes into force. And Nicola Eged-Schack must be found and brought here. And then I would very much like to speak to Mr. Klausen. - What do you think? - Good. I better get going. - I don't like this. - I'm not excited either. - What if the captain sees you? - I don't want to think about that. Herr Hauptmann... Herr Klausen. They have sent for me. Yes, I have. There are two things, you have to explain to me. And I expect an honest answer. Who is the young lady you have this morning and where is she? I don't know who you are talking about. Then we'll proceed to the second question. Why was the drunk man knocked down? Why should he be silent? I can't give you any explanation on that. I can! This young lady is Nicola Eged-Schack. She is secretly landed on Vestoe and she may not be alone. I have no knowledge of it. - (it knocks) - Yes! Mrs. Larsen is on the phone. It is important. Weiss. What? Has one of your cows been stolen? Why are you telling me that? Don't you think I have other things to do? Leave me alone! So tell me why Miss Eged-Schack has come. If she came by herself and where she is. You'll have ten seconds. Sir. captain! If I told what I knew, - - would it not be a betrayal of those I know? Look, this watch. I got that from Ms. Nichola's father. Isn't that cool? Look at the market initials and the year. Yes, but what does that mean? Well, you're right, that's not what it's about. I should tell you about Miss Nicola. I have nothing to say. - Vogel! - Herr Hauptmann. Put mr Klausen in the library. He can't leave the house. You are under arrest, Mr. Klausen. - No one saw you? - I hope not. I don't think Venus is doing very well. - No one will look for it here. - And if there is? Then I would rather they find it here than anywhere else. Stop! Where to? I have orders to tow Venus to the port, it is bound for Germany. - Who gave that order? - It has Captain... Weiss. Good... Go on. Come on, Hyacinth. No, more on that. ... It is, after all, a cow. There she comes. Thread on! Stop! Let me. Don't worry, I'll probably handle her. Damn, man. We fear that the cow breaks its leg. My good Venus… - Pull the cow away. - But... Do you think you can fool me and the German Kingdom? Obey or you'll get a bullet in the stomach. That cow is not my Venus. Muller, arrest the man. God knows if you don't have to play a little for it? Cows like music. - What time is it? - Quarter to 11. (he plays) John Morland... What is he really like? John? He is very attractive. - Is he in love with you? - Why do you ask about that? - Is he? - I do not know. - Maybe he is. - And you? What about you? Yes, what about me? In England I have been invited out a lot. The men I have been with, I learned to appreciate. But there has always come a time, - - where I suddenly discovered that they are not you. But I like John very much. If you didn't exist, I would like him even more. You know what I want to right now? To kiss you. - But I'm here. - (knocks) It's insane. Both grandfather and Kritoffer have been taken. The Germans are doing house searches. You have to go. Yes, I will. But now be careful! We must look to get off. Ditlev, you must take with us. I don't want you to stay here. The two of us will have lunch together in London tomorrow, won't we? That sounds wonderful. - (there is a knock on the door) - House search! - How long have you been there? - Since the curfew. You haven't been outside yet? - Yes, I was out in the garden. - No one else here? - No, I'm not wasting time, like you. - What do you mean? - Aren't you looking for a lady? - How do you know that? - I know so much. - Where can I find that lady? Go down to the Mermaid Bay, then you can find the miss... ... her that lady. Don't know her name... - Will you lead the way? - Me? I'm going to bed now. Vogel! England? Interesting. Pack it up. The patrol continues. To Mermaid Bay. Everyone... to the right. There is a dangerous ruckus on the whole island. They double the guard posts. Clausen went into Egedlund hours ago... - When is Nicola coming? - In a little while, I hope. I have left too much to her. There was nothing else to do. It blows up. There will be a push in the tide when it needs to carry us out. - Where is Venus? - My cousin is bringing it, the Germans knows of me. - Soren? - There they are! My cousin Ditlev. It's John Morland and Bob. We get another problem soon. - Is there a place nearby? - Yes, a cave at the beach. It is about to calve. All right, let's get off the ground. - How's it going? - Nothing has happened yet. (whistling) I have sent Vogel to the Mermaid Bay. Christ, how stupid he is! - Is it your friend? - Yes, his name is Bob. I'm Soren... Hello, are you coming to England too? No! Mr. Eged-Schack is not going to England. None of you shall that. Hands up! Also? They... Quick! Turn around! How long do we have to stand in this uncomfortable position? Until the patrol is back from Mermaid Bay. If it comes... I've placed explosive charges in the sand. - If they step on them, then... - I don't believe you. That's what I say. He's a stupid fool. - Mooh... - Oh, Venus, is it happening now? - Stay! What's up with the cow? - It is about to get its calf. - Come back! - No. They are waiting for the same as me, right? I don't know what you are waiting for. At the ship that will bring Ms. Eged-Schack to England. It can't be a big ship. Only a small vessel can enter. But they have no chance. The English doesn't know our fastest canon boat awaits them. Is it your intent to sink the little boat? No, only if it is absolutely necessary. I don't end up killing people for my pleasure. You won't be offended when I say you are a really bad soldier. What does it all mean? A woman lands and a racing cow disappears. And neither Ms. Nicola, Mr. Ditlev or the right cow is to be found. And then the english. There is a connection! Should the English have sent miss. Nicola over to steal a cow? Yes, I think so. But your Luftwaffe are giving London to the ground? Don't you know the English? Stop the engines. - Stop! - Cast anchor. So, now it's over. Venus has given birth to a son. 20 seconds. - Put that calf away! - Don't you want to eat it? Put that calf away from you... Or I shoot! You don't dare shoot a small calf, do you? Especially not the one here. You want it for Berlin. (explosions) Now what does that mean? Alert, Muller! High alert! They make a proper fist! For a man of peace, you hit with a proper fist! Soren, check if there is a man with a big beard. Tell him we are on our way. - What about him there? - We will take him to England, think they like to say hello. Come on, Venus. Psst! Excuse me, do you have a big beard? - You can believe that I have. - Is that you, Trawler? Yes, you can swear at that! Where are you from? From miss Nicola and the others. They are coming. We'll be 7. Yes, 5 adults and 2 children. Just take this. It was a fairly ordinary charge. Guard post 12 has a ship at Red Rock. - Why do you first report now? - The wire was cut. Make a beck at Red Cliff and point the measuring gun at the ship. - Don't shoot until I come. - Yes, Herr Hauptmann. Now they come. Come on, Venus. Come on. Morland? You know they arrested Klausen. They also took Kristoffer. There will be a whole lot, who will be uncomfortable when I leave the island. 'You?' You mean us. I stay here. All right. Ready to haul them in. Prepare the guns! - Shall we shoot, Herr Hauptmann? - No, 'Lubeck' has just moved there. Non-commissioned officer Vogel in his own high platform. - All aboard? - Yes, all aboard. - Where is Ditlev? - He's not coming. I don't take off without him1 Ditlev! Ditlev! Where are they? Give them an eleven aft. Shoot! (shooting) Let us go. Again. Fire! (shooting) Here comes 'Lubeck.' What a luck. It's a German. Hard starboard. Full power forward. Hard starboard. Full power forward. Show them our colours! (there are airplanes) Full cover. Air strike! There they come! Royal Air Force. Air target ahead. Height 40. (drops bombs) --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
