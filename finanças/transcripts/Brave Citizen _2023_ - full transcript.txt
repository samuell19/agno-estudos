[Mu Young High School] Keep it up for today! Come on! Come on! [This High School is Excellent at Eliminating School Bullying] This is our Mu Young High School, a school that has been awarded for eliminating school bullying for 2 years on end. It appears to be quite peaceful here. Everyone even seems to be happy. Good morning, big brother. But this place has its dark side. Gotcha. -Good job. -Out of the way. Get out of our big brother's way! [Mu Young High School] [Happy Education with Empathy, Love and Warmth] Stop aside. Doesn't it hurt? Doesn't it hurt? -Not hurt? -Good. Good. It's good now. The feeling is right. Hey, he passed out. [Go Jin-hyeong] So ugly. They resort to violence secretly without anyone seeing it. Wake him up and do that again. Psychopath. Let lost. Kimbap's here. Eat. They resort to violence in public without any concerns. Damn. So interesting. Rock Paper Scissors. Hey. Hey. Rock Paper Scissors. The dude is going to piss himself. Rock Paper Scissors. Again. Rock Paper Scissors. Is this your first time to do this? -Don't wear that poker face, Jin-hyeong. -Rock Paper Scissors. Right, or others might think you're forced to do this. -Rock Paper Scissors. -Does it hurt? I'm asking you. Does it hurt? -Jin-hyeong, do you know how to do it? -Rock Paper Scissors. Play with me or you die. Hey, dude. -Rock Paper Scissors. -Hurry up! You need to do the Paper or Rock, hey. Is he angry? Rock Paper Scissors. Hey, are you angry? Use violence just for one reason. To make themselves feel interesting. Rock Paper Scissors. Rock Paper Scissors. Hey. Interesting, right? Everyone? An ungrateful beggar is doomed to become something like this. I hope my school life can be peaceful. Rock Paper Scissors. Let's hope tomorrow will be more interesting. Right? Everyone knows about the violence but pretends not to see it. Rock Paper Scissors. -Psychopath. -Rock Paper Scissors. Rock Paper Scissors. -There are demons... -There are demons... -in our school. -in our school. [Brave Citizen] And some time ago a star came to our school. [So Si-min (Age: 30)] [Temporary Teacher] -Miss So. Yes? I'm here. Yes? Anything? How about the books? They'll be delivered soon, sir. -Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. -You're welcome. [Jang Hye-cho] Let me treat you to a cup of Caramel Macchiato. Thank you! Please add vanilla syrup. Will do. Miss So. Yes? Yes? [Lee Jae-Kyoung] Anything I can do for you? W-where is that? -The chart? The log? -No. No. The resumes of after-class lecturers? No, not that. It's kids... Miss So, come teacher. Okay, please wait a moment, teacher. No, it's kids... The grade? Voluntary activities? Right, that's it! It's here, ma'am. -It's here. Thank you. -You're welcome. How could I miss it? Good. So pretty. Hey, dean. What? Did I do anything wrong? Miss So. What? Anything wrong? This lunatic... What, sir? Damn. That dean. Why does that pervert have to stare at my butt [Why don't you read my messages?] while walking through such a broad lane? I just wanna gouge his eyes out. So disgusting! So disgusting! It's driving me mad!!! Why do I have to score the paper of Korean language? I'm the teacher of ethics! Likes to teach me things and pretend to care about everyone. And the father just bullies the weak and fears the strong!!! Why don't you read my messages! Calm down, So Si-min. You can't break down now. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I will definitely become the official employee here. Just put up with everything until I get this job. You can do this, So Si-min Teacher, teacher, teacher. About Miss So's desk. Have you told her what the position is? Will she know? Like hearing some rumors? Stop saying that. She's tenderhearted. She might pass out if she knows. Right. Teacher Yoo passed away on that spot. She should know that. Teacher Yoo used that desk, chair and stationery before passing away. My heart just can't take it when I think of that. [A Temporary Teacher of Mu Young High School Committed Suicide] Be quiet. Don't make such a fuss. [Temporary Teachers Keep Dying...] But I'm saying that for Miss So's own good. [Some said that it's because of students' bullying behaviors.] Okay, I'll go first. Miss So, are you there? Miss So. Miss So. Ouch! Ma'am, anything I can do for you? I was having hypoglycemia and listening to music. -Good day, ma'am. -Good day. Miss So, do you know I think you're cute and that I wanna help you? Of course, ma'am. So I wanna tell you something. What? Good day. You need to be careful about one thing in this school. About what? Let's talk inside. Okay. [Restricted Area No Students Allowed] Old woman, go and buy cigerretes. Students shouldn't smoke. Have some kimbap. I'll die if I have to do this. Your life is meaningless. Damn! It's dried vegetable! Dum! What? Damn. Damn. Good job. Oh my god! Hey you! What's this? How could you do that to grandma here? You scums! Get lost! Fuck! This is omakase, omakase. Grandma. -Damn it! -Grandma. Bloody hell. That old lady was involved in a case but that ended with nothing. Is he Han Soo-gang? The frightening gangster who bullies schoolmates like a demon. It's said that he works out since childhood and often beats his schoolmates. A kid was once beat up by him. So he was expelled from school, got demoted and came to our school. He's not minor. You teach ethnics. You never taught his class, right? So lucky? Why? He bullies teachers too? Last year, our temporary teacher... Nothing. Before becoming the official employee here, just close your eyes and block your ears. Pretend to be a fool. Like this, right? Right. Even if there is conflict between kids on campus, don't intervene immediately, just wait. Just let them deal with it. Don't do anything. Then nothing will happen. Okay. Especially Han Soo-gang. I'll observe him actively. If you see anything wrong... I'll just put up with it. [Seoul NCO Acadamy So Young-taek Boxing] -Smash! Police investigation. Take off your clothes. So suddenly? Let's do this. Come on! If you can be more patient, you can at least get 2 gold medals. You know that? No! I gave up sports, worked so hard and found the job. Now I'm so restless every day. Of course I'm impatient. So impatient! Impatient! Take it, Kwon-jong. Okay, come on. Yeah. Taekwondo level 3. Judo level 3. That's 6 levels in total. You're a promising star for a gold medal in boxing. Why do you want to be an employed teacher in school? [Winner of High School] Shut up! I don't wanna be an athlete in the future. Anyway, uncle's not here recently? Is he still patrolling the community the Boss Seo? He's the messenger of justice. Bullshit messenger of justice. Hey, this, this is the Award for Brave Citizen he received 20 years ago. [Thank-you Token] It destroyed him completely. [Awarding Ceremony for Brave Citizen] People should learn when to stop. Anyway, I respect him. He's the real man. The real man you respect vouched for the wrong person and still have a debt of 13.94 million won. You know how I kept this place? I gave up my life, dream and gold medals and spent 10 years paying off the debt. My father is irresponsible and vouched for the wrong person. And I protected my family. That's the key difference. But you're like your father. I and that guy? Though you talk like that, you still can't put up with wrong things. The power of justice will well up in your heart. No, no. Do you know my outlook of life? Speaking up for others is a loss. Really? [The arena for building up your body] I'll go home after finishing the exercise. Okay. Do lock the door. I will. What's that? Never seen these before. Maybe belong to those kids. Your father's working really hard. He even helps kids use the restroom during class. If a kid argues with others and cries, he'll offer comfort. The instructor here went to work as a temporary teacher suddenly. Do this suit me? Good, much better with you face covered. Keep wearing it. Meow. [Suit Shop] Hey. Old lady. Hurry up and leave. We both sell kimbap. You want us to die together? Seriously? No, no way. Go away, go away. Go and set up your stall there. It's hard for me to make money. Don't come here again. Good evening, grandma. I wanna buy kimbap. I'll take them all. Again? Grandma, your kimbap is just magical. I just wanna eat it every other day. It makes my mouth watering. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you grandma. Watch your steps. Enjoy your kimbap. I will. Bye. Okay, bye. Si-min. [Official Employee] [Trust Suspicion] What do you think is the most important? This place will become the workplace for my whole life. I promise. Don't get hurt. First, trust makes people comfortable. Whatever happens, parents will support me. Good day. Good day. Good day. School will respect your personality. Teach with love. Be fair to every student. No! Good day. Then let's be suspicious for once. The teacher's here. She's here. That backup. Is she still a teacher here? Stop pretending. Once I get the position, I'll talk to you all. No matter how small that suspicion is, once it's shared by many people, it can change the world. Nothing will happen if we do nothing. Everybody knows that, right? -Yeah. -Yeah. I'm meant to be a teacher. Get up! Isn't that Jin-hyeong? Han Soo-gang! Oh my god! Why do I hide away? Even if there is conflict between kids on campus, don't intervene immediately and hold on. Especially Han Soo-gang. I'll observe him actively. Right, there is no need for me to step in. I didn't see that. Pretend to have seen nothing. That guy! Fool. So naive. Those guys! What! What are you doing? Quiet! -Don't go! -Why? Han Soo-gang is really terrifying. If you intervene now, it's gonna be dangerous. Dangerous? His family has connections with the company behind our school? Company? Though they try to hide it, Han Soo-gang's father works in the prosecutor's office. His uncle is the chief of police bureau. His mother is a lawyer. So be careful. If you step aside, today will be your grandma's death day. Grandma's death day! We can have something delicious. Shut up. This time, I'll jump up and kick your face. Let me do that too. Will he put cheese kimbap on grandpa's altar? What about stripping his clothes and put kimbap on him? So exciting! You rubbish. Let us beat you up. Go! Yeah, I'm going to you. Damn. Okay, just right timing! Are you okay? What are you doing in the corridor? Really scared me! Who are you? Damn! What are you doing? You guys are not primary school students now. Don't play these tricks. Oh my! Are you Jin-hyeong? I thought you were a good kid! Do you like playing so much? Go back to your classroom. Now! What? The break is over! Now! Go back now! Now. Are you okay? Were you blind? You're so young but your eyes are so fierce. Damn hooligan! Do you need to go to the clinic? It hurts me so much! Be careful when walking in the corridor. Hurry and head back to the classroom. I'll help you throw this. Who's that woman? The new teacher, who comes to replace Yoo Ji-young who died because of you. What's her name? So Si-min. What a coincidence. That's fun. Yeah. Oh my god. Yoo Ji-young died because of me? I'll rip your mouth off if you talk any more nonsense. Don't make those sounds. Do you box with your mouth? Did that guy use jump kick? Yes. He jumped and kicked my face. That's not a big deal. Lift your knee and kick me. Master, can you take it seriously? I really want to punch Han Soo-gang. [Fried Chicken Restaurant] Master, did you really teach dozens of athletes? Although I have many students, among them, there's only one ace that I admire. Is he famous? Both close to be famous and unlucky. Unlucky? That student doesn't have a good dad, and thus failed. Your eyes are too sparkling. It seems like you can tolerate anything unfair. Listen. Justice is to give no tolerance to unfair things. Nonsense. That's real courage. I need to see rage in your eyes. In 1999, I became the Korean lightweight champion. Don't talk nonsense. When you just won, I knocked you out at the 33rd second in the first round. Stone boxer Seo Sang-wook. Can't you see that? [So Young-taek (Champion) VS Seo Sang-wook (Challenger)] You cried after I hit you, right? Why didn't you tell me the chicken is ready? It's almost cold. Gosh. I came to teach you when I was running errands. Be sure to spread the praising words. Stop talking to him. Just leave! Justice Apartment, Room 201? [Fried Chicken Restaurant] [2023 Outstanding School in School Violence Prevention] -Good morning, teacher. -Morning. Good morning, teacher. Do you want me to get the life teacher? Did you tell the director? They all know it. That's nice. They will help you, right? What did they tell you? Jin-hyeong, just transfer to another school. Yes, you should have a rest. What? No one dare to punish Han Soo-gang. The teachers who remain silent are also the accomplices to the abuser. Then why do you ask me for help? You already know it. Boy, I also don't know what to do. I'm a temp teacher. I can be replaced at anytime. I'm in trouble myself. My condition is as serious as yours. Please help me. What? I want to survive. Kill him. I quit. I called the police. But he's not suspected of anything, for the evidence cannot prove the abuser is him. After I called the police, I was revenged. Jin-hyeong, why don't you just transfer? No. No. I don't mean that you should do that. Why should you transfer? You are the victim. I know that. I won't transfer. And I won't drop out. Why should I drop out? Those who do wrong should be punished. If Han Soo-gang is not punished, I really can't do this anymore. Jin-hyeong is not willing to transfer. He is too stubborn. Teacher So also doesn't know what to do. I think he is in urgency. You are the one in urgency. Do you have the nerve to risk your job? Soo-gang's mother sent these cakes. To celebrate our Outstanding School recognition. These are delicious. Look at these shiny cakes. [Congratulations for being an Outstanding School in Violence Prevention] The smell of power. I definitely cannot eat this, which is not true. Sorry, Jin-hyeong. There is nothing I could do. There is just nothing I could do. The regular teachers all pretend not to see it. Why should I help you? What can I do when I'm super underprivileged? That's right. I'm also struggling for life. Delicious. It makes me full. Just find another way to live. What are you regretting? Why do you compromise at a young age? Did I teach you that? Is that how you were raised? Is it justice? You are no longer my daughter. My daughter just died in the ring. A student found me and tell me... Spare teacher So is here! Students, put away your cigarettes. Soo-gang, let's have a talk. Suddenly? Do you want to date me? Go away! Only you and me? Yes. Just us. You need someone to talk to right now. Talk? Can't we just use our bodies? Body? No, you can't. I just want to understand your problems. The starting point for problem solving is to be honest about your feelings. Let's find the trauma inside your heart -and solve it together. -What kind of teacher are you playing here? You didn't mean to bully your classmates. Right? Get away. I get the same one. -Oh. -What happened? Who did that? [A student came to me and said, "Help me." I'm going to expose school violence.] -Who reported it to the Education Committee? Who did that? -Is this Soo-gang's car? -Yes. Get away! It's Soo-gang's step mother! This is huge! Come on. Come on. Who did that? It's crazy. This will be fun. Smile. What's your grudge against him? How dare you destroy Soo-gang's future? Get him to me if this is real. Let me meet with him. Lawyer Lee. Listen up, you all. The case now falls under Article 307 of the Criminal Code for defamation. Those found guilty will be sentenced to up to five years in prison or ten years of disqualification and a fine of 10 million. By the way, Article 311 is also applicable. Who is that man? If you turn yourself in now, our benevolent representative will go easy on you. At least you can pay less in fines. But lawyer, there is also a thing called anti-impunity. According to Articles 310 and 312 of the Criminal Code, when the facts are clear, punishment cannot be imposed when the facts are in the public interest. Yeah, that's right. While there is room for debate, there is no real evidence. And it's a private matter between individuals, instead of public interest. Now we may take immediate criminal action. What? Yeah. -Room for debate? -Yeah. Oh. Think about whom you are serving! You are fired. Get out, jerk. Sorry. Teacher Jae-kyoung, it's you! Oh! You did the same thing last year. Back then we have settled it. Now what are you doing? I thought you've learned to be quiet. So you spend the year in studying the laws? You're talking laws in front of me right now? Don't you know who I am? Don't want to get promoted to Dean? Of course not. This is not what you think, Soo-gang's mom. Please calm down. And you. Don't you want to be principal next year, right? No. I want. Of course I want. Then find that guy and bring him to me right now. OK. Who is it? Please give us more time. I will find him. It's... it's me, Soo-gang's mom. It's me. Sorry, please forgive me. Sorry. Who the hell are you? Say it! Sorry. A bitch from nowhere. You have no idea what you're doing. Just get her off the job. So... I'm sorry, Soo-gang's mom. I promise that this won't happen again. I am so sorry. -I'm sorry... -You can't even educate a contract worker. How can you let such thing happen! Sorry. I will handle it... It's so fun. Right? Wow, our unlucky So Si-min. She met our unlucky Jin-hyeong. You Kimbap. You'll never get rid of me. Teacher So, apologize to the madam. Quick. I'm... I'm sorry. So what do you want to do? What? Her. Oh, Soo-gang. First, So Si-min will be fired. Fire her? That's boring. What's next? Oh. And then... Soo-gang, mom can handle it... Dean, do your job. If your fire her, I cannot play with her. Is it right? Oh. Yes, Soo-gang. I can handle it well. Have you done any research on Han Soo-gang? Can't we punish him? This is complex. Although there have been several reports, but there is no direct evidence. No. The victims are evidence. This is insane. Maybe Jin-hyeong will be accused of defamation. Let's bide our time. Why is the world like this? Ahh. Are you a real policeman? Why can't you protect ordinary citizens? Why? You think the police can do anything? Everyone want to save the world. Thank you. Uncle. You need to say hi to your father. What's wrong? Is something wrong? Tell dad. I'll help you. Are you waiting for something to happen to me? Everyday you say you want to help me? Help what? Mind your own business and don't get in the way of my future. Right. I want to rip my mouth off. Sorry... Oh. -Wow, teacher So. -Hi, teacher So. What are you doing here? You interfered into the business between me and Kimbap on purpose, right? Report to the Education Committee. Is it cool? Do you feel cool? Go to hell. A contract worker really thinks she's a teacher. -Damn it. -What is your hourly rate? -Can you get the minimum wage? -That's enough. Teacher So, are you in love with him? A teacher kissed a student. Stop that. Let's get right down to business. Now you're under my management. You stupid contract cannot figure out why you are not fired today. You might even get an official job if you just listen to me. You know it. It is a piece of cake for me. I really like you, teacher. Wow, that's insane. The teacher is sitting on the student's lap. This is totally morally bankrupt. Looks beautiful in photo. Darling, do you want to date me? Teacher So is about to cry. That's enough. Let's play basketball. Remember it. What will happen if you listen to me? Be a regular teacher. What will happen if you don't listen? You are done. Miss. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Don't be smug anymore. I won't give you the second chance. Do you think our teachers are funny? It seems to you like we've always been silent by the side. The school violence is a fight with the lawyers. School violence turns out to be a battle between lawyers. What will be the results? Jin-hyeong, a general lawyer. Han Soo-gang, a lawyer from a big firm. Who will win? They' let it go this time. If you want to be a regular teacher, think twice before you take any action. Close your eyes and cover your ears. Just be invisible... -Is that OK? -It's OK. I agree. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Damn it. Sorry. You stupid woman. Go to hell. -Ahh. -Damn. You stupid foolish. Open your eyes when walking. Hear that? Answer me. Fuck. What the hell. Were you sighing? Ehh? You bitch. Apologize when you run into a person. Son of a bitch. What the hell. You. Apologize to me. Was I wrong? Did I make a big mistake? What about Jin-hyeong? Did he also make mistakes? The world should have its rules. The rules can be omitted and infringed at your will just for fun? Yes. You are the one who violate the rules. You bitch. Are you hearing? Damn it. That's not right. Show some respect, or I'll beat you up. Do you want another punch? You bitch. Hey. Hey. Throw it. What are you doing, jerk? Grab the legs. -Pass it. -Don't tackle! Damn it. Sorry. You jerk, aren't you shooting three-pointers? Hell. What? Fuck. I'm sick. Isn't these the minions? Crazy? Go to hell. Chicken is here. I'll come later. -You ordered that? -Yes. Yes, you bastard. Fuck. When you do wrong, you should pay for it. Yes, pay for it. Han Soo-gang, you can really say some witty words. When you do wrong, you should pay for it. Who are you? Mew. Shit. Damn it. What did I see? Hell. Fuck. Fuck. Kick. Kick. Fuck. He loses? Loser. -Police. Police. -Run! -Bro, run! -Run away! -Catch him! -Come on! -If we get caught this time, it's over. -Bro. -Run, come on! -Hey! -You run first. -Bro, come on! -Don't move. -Run away! Don't move! -Go! -Bro! Come on! Bro, we gotta go. Fuck, don't be a coward. No. [School Violence Prevention and Eradication Outstanding School Recognition] Good morning! But Han Soo-gang should be beaten up. So, who? What do you mean? Big news! Big news! Han Soo-gang was beaten up! Gosh. Tell the truth. You are excited, right? What are you talking about? Han Soo-gang is our student. You are way too happy. I was unhappy yesterday. Who have beaten him? A man wearing a cat mask. A man with a cat mask. Take a photo. [Han Soo-gang this loser bastard, hahaha Punish him!!] Han Soo-gang. Cat? Han Soo-gang. It's Han Soo-gang! What are you doing? -Teacher Jae-kyoung, -Yes. Soo-gang was beaten? Yes. I have heard that Soo-gang was beaten. I feel sad. Mr. Lee, morning. Flowers are beautiful, right? Although I have never met you before, I will occasionally buy flowers for you from now on. Who did this? Who is so bold? Shit, surrender yourself. Shit. What are you doing? Han Soo-gang. -What's wrong? -Who scribbled on the desk? Who did it? Who did it? Let me check the school rule. Let's see what we should do to punish him. We can just change the desk. Why is there a commotion in the morning because of something like this? You should follow the rule at school. Rule? My legs are shaking. He smiled at me. Hey, slow down. If we get caught because of speeding, we are dead. I won't have this kind of thing happen in my life. Who is the cat? It's not Gyung-ho. It's not Lee Jin-hyuk from Jo Yang High School and Gae Sang-jin from El Le High School. Do we have those hidden masters in our school? Shit. Shit. -Shit. -Shit, there's no Gimbap. Hey. Let's ask Jin-hyeong to hang out with us. Oh, the psychopath. I can even hear you thought in your mind. Gimbap is nice. What's our concept today? What kind of Gimbap should he bring? Have I ever let you disappointed? Your eyes is the problem. Watch me. Your gesture should be humble but your eyes should look arrogant. Move your step. Yes, you're kind of slow. Come on, stand on tiptoe. -Yes. -Master. There's a chaos in our school. What happened? Because of the cat. They said it's Master So Si-min. So Si-min. She's my daughter. I raised her. She's a real boxer. That, that sad boxer who is unlucky and doesn't have a good father. Are you happy? 33 seconds. I'm happy. Take this, come on. This is a secret. I can tell by looking at your back. You beat students with the mask? A teacher beats students? It's not beating, it's educating. It's for the gang. This is violence. Violence. It's justice. Justice. Didn't you say justice is nothing? Whatever. This is right, your opinion is wrong. Don't do anything. It doesn't suit you at all. Just give in to reality like you used to be. You should endure injustice. Just live for yourself. I hope boxer So Si-min can live happily. Yes. This doesn't suit me, right? Actually, I also feel uncomfortable. There is no correct answer for living your life. But you will be found out someday. So Si-min, just don't draw any attention. But, Kwon-jong, I should make a cape or something else. That's enough. Don't do that. -Are you crazy? Do you want to die? -Wait, wait. [Suit Shop] Please make it beautiful. Don't worry. I'm good. -OK, bye. -Bye. Let me see. How can I repair it to look good and become famous? Hey, don't do it too over. If you don't finish it in five minutes, you'll have to take off your underpants and start over again. Oh. Oh, they are so evil. Jin-hyeong, are you okay? Oh, they are assholes. -Jin-hyeong. -Half original flavor, half sauce. What? Half original flavor, half sauce. Oh, OK. Jin-hyeong, wait for me. Jin-hyeong. This is cool. Yes. Who am I? Why do I do this? Good job. Oh, you scared me to death. -What's wrong, Byoung-jin? -Teacher. Jin-hyeong is being bullied. He is forced to only wear his underwear. Hurry up. What? Where? In the billiard room. No, you should dress like a boy. What are you doing, Byoung-jin? I know. -My hero. -What? It's not me. I saw you beating Han Soo-gang wearing this mask. I called the police that day. I am also the person who promotes cat-mask man in school. Help us, teacher. Are you okay? Should I help you to call? It's just a joke. We are closed friends. Does this make sense? This is crime. Crime. Oh, no matter how close you are, how can they joke like this? You want more turnip, right? Here. Oh, and this. Put this on before you leave. Hey, what are you doing? Hey. How funny. Hello, it's me. I have posted a few very unconventional videos. Change the sound in the video. Edit it and post it on the internet. There are many perverts who like these things. The more new videos, the better. -Make the video better and increase the click amount. -Min-kyu. -Yes. -It's your turn. Hey. Take this away. Shit, what a devil. How can you beat there? It's my turn. It's my turn. Go away. Are you a rogue? [Go Jin-hyeong] Hey, it's the cat-mask man. Does he come to provoke? What? I didn't see Jin-hyeong. I will reveal the mask today by myself. Don't do this, Jin-hyeong. Go to hell, you son of a bitch. What to do now? [Billiard Club] What is all this? You little brat. Bastard. Help me. I want to survive. Look at you. What should we do about you? Get up. Come on. Come on. Go to hell. Fuck you! -Fuck you! -Come on. Fuck you! -Fuck you! Fuck you! -Come on. [Emergency Center] Your life could have been in danger. [Seong-sul Hospital Blood Bank Name So Si-min] Lucky you missed the artery. Although you lost a lot of blood, you're fine. She'll be transferred to the general ward and the nurses will be watching. Visit her twice a day. Thank you. Jin-hyeong. I heard Jin-hyeong is here. Oh my god, my baby. Oh, my child. What are you doing here like this? Are you okay? Do you hurt? Why are you here grandma? You can't be here. Grandma you can't be here. It's dangerous. It's alright. It's alright. Don't worry. Let's go. Go home, my grandson. You almost died. Oh, it's really... It's the first time I've ever lived to see a teacher get stabbed. Are you okay, Si-min. I was just cut by accident. Save your brave talk. Did I teach you sports to see you like this? You should call the police facing such people. Is this something a teacher should stand up for? Tell him to be quiet. One more thing. You must not tell the police. Or Jin-hyeong would be the only one who get hurt. I am a police myself. He who hit me actually saved me. Why? Go to hell, you son of a bitch! Who on earth are you? Oh god. Another one? What the hell? Did he change clothes? Is it the same guy? Seems like a different cat. What? Is it an organization? What are you doing? We are the brave cats. You packed too many things. You're gonna be in the hospital for a few days. I'm going to work. Your wound would open. I'll be careful. I wouldn't miss work for the sake of Jin-hyeong. He stabbed someone with a knife. If the school finds out, he'll be expelled. So please just act like you don't know. So what do you plan to do? I don't know. If there's anything I can help, I will. Hey, So Si-min. What happened to Dad's face? He said he was going to avenge you, and then that's it. What did you say? Did he went to Han Soo-gang? He wanted to do something. You guys are totally the same. You really... Where are you going? She said she would go to work. Don't go. Have a few days off. Let me take you. No need. I'll take a taxi. I told you. You don't have to come with me. But I also have to go home. Miss So. Oh my god, minister. Miss So, what are you doing here? My dad was hurt. I came with him. I'm Si-min's father. I got hurt accidentally. Okay. Why are you here, minister? I... I... I'm looking after my sister. I didn't have a husband. So I have plenty of time and do a lot of things around the house. I'm single too. You should go, minister. Ah, right. I'll get going. See you at school, minister. Okay, hope you get better soon. Okay, take your time. -My sister's asleep. -Right. Right. Okay. Wait a minute. Are you awake？ [The final selection of national boxing representatives] Si-min. The day of the national selection finals... [2011 National selection for the Olympic Games] Hit hard. Hit in. What are you doing? Get in your defensive position. Time's up. Yang Jun Kyung has become the first female boxing national representative in Korean history. Are you crazy? Is the chance to compete in the Olympics a joke? Fine, I'll explain myself. Tell me. Why don't you defend? Drink bogax and get it going. [Bogax] Your dad's gym's been prohibited from running. I heard it is to be auctioned? Think about it carefully. Just lower it by twenty centimeters. She's the one without a mother, right? Unable to even place the trophy on her mother's memorial table. You only care about money, huh? Damn beggar. Did you lose for my sake? Our house has already been marked for demolition, right? I'm still young. I'll prepare well for the next Olympics. Why did you have to lose to her? At such a young age, why should you compromise? I will not consider you as my daughter any longer. My daughter died on the boxing ring just now. You gave up your own dreams to protect your family. That line was meant for myself. It's too shameful. I've committed a great sin against you. Damn. When did you wake up? Ow. Dad feels sorry for you. Don't cry. A few days ago. Several cats ran away after being severely beaten by Soo-gang. But they're hiding in the school. I hope everyone can help find them. Recently, if you see someone with a bruise or a knife wound on their face or arm, that's the cats. Remember, there are two cats in total. If you help find the cats, you won't have to worry for the rest of your life. But if you cover for them, you're dead. Boys, show your left arms. What's the matter? Hurry up and show them. Damn bitches. Okay. Okay. I'm doing it. Stretch your arm out. Have you checked? Stretch it out now. Hey, is it you? I said it's not me. You're hurting me. Stop it! Damn it. Enough! What the hell are you? Turning the school atmosphere so terrifying. Is there no law here? It's not the cats that have collapsed, it's you. Isn't it because of shame that it's come to this? It's because of bitches like you that we're hunting for cats. The cats that trap you in illusions. I'll tear him up in front of you. Be prepared. If the cat doesn't turn himself in, or if no one reports, I'll kill one every day. Got it? [Mu Young High School] Miss. So. Yes, did you call me? [Lee Jae-kyung] This is still a secret. Don't be scared. Miss So will soon become a regular employee. Congratulations. You've worked hard during this time. Really? Really? Thank you. Thank you. Oh my, you deserve this. Thank you, teacher. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Lee, I will strive to be a good teacher. [Thank you for teaching.] [Ethics teacher is the best.] [Our school's first beautiful teacher] [Ethics Teacher] [So Si-min] I'm confident that I can do it well. We find that no one has wound on their arms whose height are over 175 cm in every class. Are you sure? I am sure he is not anyone who has fought with us. Damn it. We've asked everyone. Damn. It's so strange. Hello. Bingo. -Kwon-jong. -Yes. Sister. I'm going to be a regular teacher. What, really? Congratulations, Teacher So Si-min. Congratulations, sister. Kwon-jong, I'll call you back later. Um, okay. I found the cat. Meow. Soo-gang, what are you saying? I just thought it was strange. The knife that was supposed to stab me ended up that a cat got stabbed for me. Why did you save me? You didn't save me, but for Jin-hyeong. Because if that guy stabbed me, it would have been a big deal. What are you doing? Let go of me. I heard you miraculously will become a regular teacher. What to do? What are you doing? I could kill you right here, but that would be no fun. Han Soo-gang. How do you feel wearing this? Beggar's hat. [38th Mu Young High School Anniversary 2023 Mu Young Festival] It's been a long time since I've had this much fun. Fine. Let one of us die. Let's have a great final match on the boxing ring. What do you mean? If you don't get on the ring, the video of the Kimbap wielding a knife will be played in front of the entire school. I will also call the police. My guys filmed it really well. Soo-gang, this is not a game. I just want to ask you one thing. Do you really feel no guilt for what you've done? Do you think we're on the same level? If you're born a beggar, you'll die a beggar. Don't you understand this simple truth? Salute. Hello, teacher. Hello, everyone. [Transfer Application] [Sora Apartment] Is anyone there? Who is it? Hello, I'm So Si-min, Jin-hyeong's teacher. Hello. Oh my god. Grandma. Grandma. Do you remember me? Oh my, oh my god. Oh my god. Teacher. That angel-like person is our Jin-hyeong's teacher. Teacher, please save our Jin-hyeong. To protect my elderly grandmother, he endured everything at school. Because I'm powerless, unable to protect my own child. Oh, what are you saying, Grandma? Just wait a moment. This is all I can give you. Please save our Jin-hyeong. Thank you. I'll enjoy it. Jin-hyeong. Didn't you ask me to save you? You showed courage in front of me. I'm really ashamed to face you. I'm sorry, Jin-hyeong. Sorry. No matter how I think about it, I don't feel I did anything wrong. So I asked them, why do they treat me this way? What did I do wrong? They said it's because it's for fun. Just for fun. Jin-hyeong. Grandma. Grandma. Stop. What's this guy doing? Oh! My baby. It's okay. Let's go home. Jin-hyeong. Stop. Please, stop. I told you to stop! Stop! Really. I won't let you go. It's really funny. Damn shit. Not letting us go? What do you want to do if we don't stop? Damn. I will do everything as you said. Soo-gang. I'll do as you've ordered. Please, spare my grandmother. Please, I beg you. Really? Then first, eat these. The precious food made by your beloved grandmother. Are you going to throw it away? Idiot. You've graduated now. Starting today, Go Jin-hyeong Go is elected. Come on, graduation photo. Cheese. From now on, your name is Kimbap. If you dare to disobey even a single word I say, your grandmother is dead. I used this hand to hurt someone. I just wanted to protect Grandma. She's all I have left. What did I do wrong to deserve this treatment? You haven't done anything wrong, Jin-hyeong. That person is already much better. It's okay. And you've taken good care of grandma. Well done. Jin-hyeong. Let's defeat them together. Be sure to show up on the celebration. Jin-hyeong. [Nothing will change if nothing is done] [38th Mu Young High School Festival 2023 Mu Young Festival] Mu Young High School, today is the celebration. Fighting! What's wrong? What's wrong? They say Han Soo-gang will fight. [Final Duel Death Warrior Han Soo-gang VS Faceless Cat-mask Man] Will the cat-mask man really appear again today? Excuse me. What are you doing? [Who is the cat? We are the cats. We are the cats!] Darkness cannot overcome light. Children, we are on the cat's side. -Got it? -So cute. We are on the cat's side. I've made a lot. You have to wear this, okay? Guys, over here, come and take these. We are on the cat's side, got it? You must wear it. You must wear it. Si-min. Uncle, why are you here? Fighting! Teacher. Byoung-jin. What are all those? Teacher, you're not alone. I'm burning with my little passion. I prepared these with the president. I was the one who called the police that day. I was the one who promoted the cat-mask man at school. I understand Jin-hyeong's feelings. Han Soo-gang targeted Jin-hyeong because of me. I'm just as bad as Han Soo-gang. I really think so. Please help me, teacher. You must win today. My hero. Now. The 38th Mu Young High School Festival begins! Hi, heard you've become a regular teacher. English teacher. You finally realized your dream, right? Yes, finally. Thank you, teacher. I'll work hard. Han Soo-gang and the cat-mask man are dueling in the boxing ring. Is it to gain favor? The dean approved it. Really? Who will win? Will the cat-mask man appear? I think it would be great if the cat-mask man appeared. What? Seeing the cat-mask man reminds me of my brave youth. So Si-min doesn't know what life is. Stand up, raise your hand. I will retire actively. I'm sorry, please forgive me. I'm sorry, Mom. It's not beating up, it's education. What a jerk. This is not a game, Soo-gang Teacher feels sorry about that. Let's defeat them. If we do nothing, nothing will change. Han Soo-gang, Han Soo-gang. Tell me where he is. Come out. Cat. Cat. Now is the beginning. So Si-min, the real battle of your life. Soo-gang is here. Han Soo-gang, Han Soo-gang, Han Soo-gang. Han Soo-gang, Han Soo-gang, Han Soo-gang. Kwon-jong's surprise gift. What's Kwon-jong doing? [Free Range Chicken] Eh... Don't take the mask off. Cat! Cat! Cat! Cat! Cat! Si-min, Si-min. Is she a woman? She's actually a woman. Men can also have long hair. She's a woman, huh? Cat! Cat! Cat! No, now we really have to stop him. Who do you think you are? Damn woman. Should I take it off? Should I let you run a bit more before taking it off? Or take it off now? The whole school is watching. You're too ashamed to take it off, right? Soo-gang, take off her mask. Answer me. Damn, you damn woman. Sister, you can do it. Get up. Hold on. Stop, bastard. -Hey -Stop. Get up. You, pig-like woman. Teacher said, Jin-hyeong. I won't give up. Kick him quickly. Cat. Cat... I will make you kneel. Kneel miserably in front of him. Never stand up again. Will make you see clearly who you are kneeling to. Don't take it off. Don't take it off. No, no. -It's Teacher Si-min. -It's Teacher Si-min. Teacher So. Sister. Hey. Snap out of it. Are you crazy? I don't care. Let go of me. That devil must be punished too. So Si-min, So Si-min... Whatever I suffered, I will return it to you. Get away! Go to hell. Here you are. Damn. Dean, please go stop it. Teacher So. Go away. Go away. Don't be like this. Teacher So. That's enough. Teacher So. Let me go. Teacher So. What are you doing to a student? Get down now. If you don't come down, your regular teacher position will be cancelled. Get down now. Shut up. Fuck off. You, don't meddle in this. I'll kill this bitch. Hey, even if I kill you, it won't matter. Do you know why? Damn, because this is a fair fight. I'll show you it is legal for me to kill someone. You bitch. Stupid. Damn. Hit. Teacher will make him apologize to you. I will make the one who did wrong kneel down in front of you. Teacher will show you. Apologize to Jin-hyeong. You're not completely incapable of reflection. This society's weapon, please apologize. Go to hell. I don't need your apology. Because you have already lost to everyone. Go to hell. Damn. Bastard. Go away. Go away. Come here, you bastard. Go to hell. Damn. Does the victim Go Jin-hyeong want to punish the perpetrator Han Soo-gang? Yes, I want to. I'm here to report. I'm reporting the school violence video. The mastermind behind the school violence video that was uncovered. [Absurd School Violence... Arrest of High School Student Han] Including Han, several minors are involved. The police found out that the suspect, Han, was also related to the suicide case of a contract teacher Lee a year ago in this school and started a re-investigation. Contract teacher... also related. Is this true? Because it's fun. Have you ever thought about apologizing to the victim? Why should I apologize? This anonymous teacher told us he just did [Resignation Letter] what he should do, as a citizen of this society. [So Si-min] [So Si-min Boxing MMA Weight Loss Gym] One two three four. One two, punch. Good. Next, start clapping. Go to the right side. OK. Diagonal, diagonal. One, two, three, punch out, punch out. One, two, kick. Members, well done. Random jumping time.

Are you crazy? Damn, turn off the broadcast. Damn, so annoying in the morning. Don't know how to drive? Damn, shit. Hello there. [Brave Citizen] What's your reason for applying to our school? My only reason for applying to this school is to give the students of the The Best High School all my love and the abilities I possess. To make The Best High School the sacred ground for students getting into prestigious universities. What would you do if you see the injustice? [Dean of Education, Lee Jae-kyoung] I would endure it.
