If somebody's in here, you better come out now! Who's in here? Where are you? Come out! No, get out! Hey Robert. Listen, we need to talk. Lynn's attorney just called, and she's not budging on the alimony, so we need to discuss some other options and liquidation of any assets under your name. Give me a call and we'll figure out a plan, okay? Hey, ma. I hope you don't mind me crashing for a bit. Okay. Yes! Cheers, Edna. Where the hell did you come from? Hello? Hello there, Tommy. Where did you come from? Raccoons. Forgot about them, Tommy. I love this place. Put you over here with your buddies, huh? Jesus. Y'all be cool. Goddammit! Sorry, doorbell doesn't seem to work. You're not supposed to be here. Neither are you. I want you to call your mother right now and have her come pick you up. Why would I do that? Because I told you to, and you don't need to see me like this. Well maybe you need me to. Maybe that's the only thing that will keep you from destroying yourself. I already crossed that bridge, Sammey. And I failed, okay. I don't want you to be any part of this. I already crossed that bridge too. I'm calling your mother. I'm not living with that bitch anymore. Hey, don't you talk about her like that. That's my job. I don't care how mad you think you are. Sammey, I screwed up, okay? It was me. Someday you'll get it. I get it fine! I am 17, not seven! Sammey, you just, seeing me like this, it's just, you feeling sorry for me, it's just gonna make you resent me. Okay, and I don't want that. You're too young to understand. When Lynn finds out you're here, she's gonna shit a brick. Well, I'm not leaving, so you might as well quit bitching. I'm going to bed. So you're not gonna call Mom? No need to. She's not an idiot like your father. Weird. Attic Dolls. Good morning. Good morning, Sammey. You dumped my booze? Don't get mad. Sammey, I know you're trying to help, but uh, I really need that to write. I've gotta get this book out. Attic Dolls? Have you seen my keys? Just eat something. There she is. Robert? Sammey? Hello? Really? Don't look at me. Gee Mom, I'm sorry some of us don't just throw each other away like garbage. Sammey. No, Dad, I am nothing like her. So what is it? You just wanna stay here and booze all day with your dad? I see where she gets the judgmental thing from. I'm not judgmental. She's just a bitch. Sammey, that's enough. It's fine, I'm, I'm used to being the bad cop. Sammey, I know this was hard on you, but this is not the right environment for you. Yeah, no, it's way better for me to be around a cheating slut! Hey! Shit. You know, it's gonna take everything that we have to get us out of debt and pay for Sammey's college right now. Was that my doing? No, and that's what I'm doing here, okay. I'm gonna make it right. Right, we've seen how you do that. Look, Lynn, just let her stay here a couple of days. Okay? She's on vacation anyway. I'll talk to her. She's been really upset. Don't talk to me like I wouldn't know that. You're not even on the wagon right now. I didn't know she was showing up, okay, and she dumped out everything I have, so you can relax on that. Yeah? Sammey also stopped taking her medication. I didn't want her on that anti-anxiety bullshit in the first place. Still, I think it's dangerous to leave the two of you alone when you're both unstable. Thank you, Dr. Phil. Robert, I don't think it's a good idea for either of you to stay here. The way your mother died was so... It was an accident, okay? And we're both adults. Maybe her more than me. But we need this time together, okay, Lynn? And I promise, I won't drink a drop while she's here. You should probably make that a promise for everyone. Planning on it. I need her home in two days, and I want her to call me tomorrow. That's a deal. Is there anything else? Please be careful. I got that. Sticks a little bit. Bitch. Can I come in, Monkey? Not if you call me Monkey. You used to love it when I called you Monkey. That was a long time ago. I don't know, you still look pretty monkey-like to me with your little monkey head. That was God awful and I need you to stop it. Mom says you stopped taking the pills. I feel better without them. You probably are and I think that was the correct Monkey decision to make. I know. Look, no one ever told me how to be a dad. I didn't exactly do the greatest job teaching myself. I was always just a better friend to you. What you really needed was a real Pop. And I should've fixed things when they mattered. Sammey, you know I love you. I have a problem, I know. I'm trying to fix it. Being around somebody going through withdrawals is not a pretty sight, it gets kinda hairy and I didn't want you around that but, now that plan's screwed, I'm actually gonna have to ask you for your help. With what? Well if you won't leave my alone to stew in my own funk, I'm gonna need someone to help me with coloring and shading. Seriously? But your mom wants you back in a couple of days and it might take a little longer than that but, you let me worry about that. Once we're finished here, you gotta be a team player. You're gonna promise me you're gonna do what she wants, OK? We have a deal? Tell me about Attic Dolls. Come on, let's go look. Come on. And I'm getting rid of all this stuff, so please, feel free to dig around. Alright. Sammey, I wanted to introduce you to my new friends. That big guy there, he's Matthew. And the little lady is Chia and that's my friend, Tommy. OK, that's a little creepy. Listen, not everybody can stay cute forever, ya know? Well, I never thought dolls were cute. Well, you better help me make em cute. I don't wanna scare away the kids. Did you play with them when you were little? Oh hell no. I don't even know where these came from. Ya know, it's funny, earlier when I got here, little Tommy there, I found him standing in the middle of the hall just by himself like he got there on his own. Whatever dude. No, it's like he got there all by himself. I'm serious, you keep an eye on these three. I don't want em creeping up on you in the dark of the night. God, you realize your jokes are terrible, right? I gotta take this, it's the publisher. Hold on, be right back. What's up, guys? Tommy, you don't look so bad. You, on the other hand, didn't age so well. What's wrong with you, girl? You scared the shit outta me. Sorry, it doesn't mean you gotta go tossing my dolls all around. What'd she ever do to you? I don't care what you say, those things give me the creeps. Well, I think they're a good concept and we're rolling with it. So, the dolls stay. Get used to em. Fine. Now, I gotta get ready for that meeting with the publisher and honestly, take anything you want outta here. Nope. Fuckin' great. Coffee? You're the best. I found my keys. Okay, what about breakfast? I'll pick something up later. Coffee is not breakfast. I'm gonna be at the publisher's for a couple hours at these meetings. You gonna be OK to take care of yourself, yeah? Might even make myself useful. That's the spirit. We need some light in here. What the hell is that? Don't know. Good morning, can I help you? I don't know. I'm looking for Edna. Are you a friend of hers? Yes. Well, my brother was a patient of hers years ago. She's the only one that could ever help him and he passed away recently. I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you know where I can find Edna? I'm sorry to tell ya this, but she passed away recently too. Oh dear. Let me get you inside. We can sit down for a minute, OK? There you go. Thank you. Sure. I'm sorry. She was important to us. I wanted to tell her about Henry in person. And Henry, that was your brother? What's your name? Margaret, dear, yours? I'm Sammey and my dad, Robert. Oh, you're Robert. That's me, Edna's son. Yes, she often spoke of you. The artist. That's right. Margaret, I am truly sorry for your loss and to add the shocking news on top of it but I was just on my way out to a meeting. If there's anything we can do for you, please just let us know. Oh, please don't let me keep you. I'm sorry to disturb you. Oh no, it's completely fine. You're not disturbing us at all. Yeah, why don't you stay a while? I'm not doing anything. You can hang out for a bit. We're clearing out some of my grandma's old things. You could see if it's anything you wanna keep. Well, I don't wanna intrude on the two of you. It's no intrusion, not at all. Sammey, why don't you make some lemonade for Margaret and I'll be back in a little bit, OK? You're very kind. I am very sorry for your loss. And you too. Back in a flash. My dad wasn't close to his mom so, I never really got to know Edna. May I ask how she helped you brother, Henry? Well, do you know that your grandmother spent her career helping folks with serious mental illnesses? I've heard a little bit about it. My brother has dissociative identity disorder. Is that multiple personalities? Yes, that's right. He believed he was possessed by demons. And he... He was like a monster, but then, Edna worked with him and he was just Henry, the brother I knew when we were kids. Well, it's nice to know she was able to help him, make his life a little better. Ya know, there's some interesting things upstairs as well. Let me go grab a box. You won't believe these dolls we found. Dolls? Yeah, these three dolls up in the attic. They're pretty cool but we're using them for a project. You should still see them though. Stay right there. I guess my dad must've moved em somewhere. Hello? Margaret? Margaret? You still here? Now that, I can do. Dad? Jesus Christ. Everything's fine, everything's fine. Don't be a basic bitch. We're not afraid of ghosts. No ghosts, not real. Oh, so you're the little punk that's been thumping around on the roof. There, see Sammey? No ghosts. Excuse me, Miss? Hey, hey, excuse me. Oh! Shit! Who the hell are you? I'm James. I did not mean to scare you, I'm sorry. Damn, I'm sorry. I did not mean to smack you but what the hell are you doing here? I do Edna's yard work. She around? Yeah, did no one get the memo? What do you mean? I'm sorry if you guys were friends or hopefully not related but, she bit the dust man. Seriously? Afraid so. Did not hear about that. Apparently no one did. Were you close? No, no, no, we weren't close. I've done her yard work for the last three something years, but I didn't know her very well. Me neither. She was my grandma. Damn, that blows, I'm sorry. Eh, life goes on til it doesn't, right? Yeah. So you wanna smoke? I don't usually smoke with strangers. Smacked by em? Not very often, no. My name's Sammey. And how old are you, Sammey? 21. Sorry I hit you all up in your face. It's all good. Was a good hit. Now that's a good hit. Yeah. I wish I knew Edna had such a cool granddaughter. It's a good thing she's dead. Otherwise we would've never met. Wow, that's messed up. What are you going to school for? I don't know yet. I'm only going to make my mom happy, but I wanna be an artist like my dad, even though his life sucks. Your dad's a artist? Why, you actually like art? Yeah, I actually like art, smartass. Let me see what he does. Alright. Alright, so we talking paint art? Drawing, what's he do? Eh, some of both. Is it weird staying here after your grandma... Paled her head? Little bit. Still better than staying with my mom though. Gingerbread Bears? Oh shit, I used to love this book. Yeah? Yeah. Wanna see what we're working on now? Yeah! Attic Dolls. That is so cool. When the hell did he draw this? What do you mean? Nothing, I just didn't know he had the time to finish this much. Can we read it? Go for it. Alright. The Attic Dolls live up the stairs. You'll hear them laugh and run up there. But when you go upstairs to play, they'll be standing still each day. If you turn your back on them, you'll hear them run around again and if you get to see them move, that's when they'll come for you. Shit, that's my dad. Um, we should probably, yeah. - Absolutely. Wow, that's awful. Hey Dad. This is James. He came by to do some yardwork for Grandma, go figure. Hey Mr. Holbrook. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm a big fan of your books for kids. Must be a big fan of kids too seeing as how you're hanging around 17 year olds. Dad. Sammey, being too young to buy a pack of cigarettes is nothing to be ashamed of, isn't that right, James? Oh my God, you are such an ass! Um, Mr. Holbrook? You're still here? Uh yeah. Um, I just wanted to see if maybe you'd still want the yard work done and Edna wanted the garage and the deck painted as well. I was kinda counting on this job to go on a trip next week. It's my last chance to get up cash, so... Look son, I'm kind of in the middle of a mess right now. No worry, I just thought I'd ask 'cause I haven't seen my family in a while. They live in Germany now and all my friends around here moved away. So it's kinda just me. But sorry to bug you guys. Wait a minute. How long will it take you? Uh, couple days. 100 bucks a day. How bout 60 a day and you're hired. OK, yeah, that sounds great. Great and James, she's not an adult. Do you understand me? You got nothing to worry about Mr. Holbrook. I am a responsible young man. Thanks to the lessons I learned in your books. Great, now get outta here before I chance my mind. Yes sir, I'll be back first thing in the morning. Oh my God, I need a drink. Don't be mad at me, Monkey. Don't be an ass to people. Sammey, you're still a teenager and I am your father. Therefore, I am obligated by law to be an ass sometimes. Whatever. What happened to that lady earlier? Margaret? Mmhmm. Did you know that Grandma treated her brother? No, I had no idea. Anyway, I went up to show her the dolls but when I came back down, she was gone. Where'd you put them anyway? What? The dolls, I couldn't find them. I didn't move them. Well, they're not where you had them earlier. What are you talking about? See that, they're right there. No but you... how could... they were not there when I came up. Well, did anyone else come up here today? No. Did Zac Efron come upstairs today? Nobody's been up here but you and me. They just, they weren't. You feelin' alright, honey? I'm not making this up! Fine, I believe you, but if you're feeling a little foggy, it might be a withdrawal from the medication. I understand. I'm not foggy from withdrawal Dad. Quit projecting on me. I'm gonna go get some sun before it goes down. Wait a minute. Okay. The Attic Dolls live up the stairs. You'll hear them laugh and run up there. But when you go upstairs to play, they'll be standing still each day. If you turn your back on them, you'll hear them run around again. And if you get to see them move, that is when they'll come for you. You can't hide from the Attic Dolls. They'll watch you from inside the walls. When you try to run from them, that's... Help me. You'll wish you hadn't come to stay. When you look away, they play. Dad? Sammey? Sammey, I'm going to bed. Congrats. Dad? Dad! Dad? Dad! Dad? Calm down, what's wrong? Dad, I think somebody broke in. I heard running. Honey, you heard me. I was looking for the breaker. No Dad, I swear, it was something else. I heard it in the hall! What you heard was me, OK? Now calm down, we'll go turn the lights on and go look. - Dad, Dad, I'm not lying. It was something in... really? - Come on. We can fix this. There, you see? All better. It is not all better, Dad. I keep hearing sounds up in the attic. There's all these hiding places. I mean, some pervert could be living here and we'd never know. Sammy, there's no pervert. There, you see? Alright, come on. Wait, where are we going? I'm gonna show you that it's not bad. Okay? You can see there's nobody up here. Maybe the perverted raccoons on the roof. You think I'm imagining things again. No, not at all. Look, you said you saw a raccoon. Dad, it's not just up here, OK? Those smaller doors, I swear I've been seeing them shutting and moving. Crawl space doors. You know how tight those spaces are in there? Oh and you want me to go in there and look. Mmhmm. Ugh, you're tearing me apart, Sammey. Be careful. Huh, careful is my middle name. No it's not. It's Arthur. Hold on. Dad! All clear. Grandma liked to fish? Oh no, I did. Made me think my old man was still around. Speaking of the old man, I had a bunch of old photos I put in there. You see em? The ones of your parents? Yeah, where'd you put em? I didn't put em anywhere. I saw them but I didn't move them. Well if you didn't move them, who did? Probably whoever is hiding up there. OK Sammey, we have been through every nook and cranny of this house. Well then I guess I'm losing my shit, Dad. Look, I just don't wanna talk about this any more, OK? If someone broke into our house, stole the pictures, great, good luck to them. I hope they enjoy them. Right now, I'm just gonna get some sleep. Goodnight Sammey. Got a meeting with the sales team this morning, so I'm gonna be out for a while. Know how to feed yourself and all that? I'm not a pet. I think I'll live. Oh wow, these are really nice. Thanks, I figured I'd do some mock ups. Oh no, don't even bother. Yeah, you like the style? Yeah, just keep going. I'm almost to the end, so we can knock this out real quick. And hey, no flirting with Justin Bieber today. It's a work day. Go to your meetings, dork. I'm serious. What happened to your face? dummy, dummy. I need to get outta this house. You have to get rid of those things! What things? The dolls, they're evil! What are you talking about? Your grandmother, she's the one who made them that way. I don't understand. It all started with Henry. Henry had multiple personalities. One was the soul of a lost little boy. The other two were demons. Edna got the demons to speak to her. They were using Henry's body as a vessel where they could keep the little boy's soul trapped and feel off his terror and suffering. But no doctor or priest could free Henry of these three entities until one day when Edna tried a different approach. Henry, I want you to meet some new friends of mine. Those are dolls. You're right but these dolls are very special. They belonged to a group of nuns in Latin America doing mission work for victims of famines, genocide. Dolls had powers to absorb the darkest energies and bring healing. Today, they're here to lighten your darkness. These entities possess you because there's a part of you that needs them. You don't need them any more, Henry. These dolls will be their vessel now. Let's move them out of you. We can start with the boy. Are you ready, Henry? Edna was wrong. Those demons were every bit as real as the monsters who terrorized Henry as a child. She knew deep down that those dolls carried something with them, something dark from all the pain and horror they'd absorbed and she was too foolish to just destroy them. No! As far as the asylum was concerned, Edna cured Henry. He never showed signs of his condition ever again. By now, Henry was so much better, he could come home. Henry was close to being back to normal, so what could would it to upset him? He seemed to be getting so much better. Until one night when I was at work... Where are you? Stop, get out! Henry? Oh! They blamed Edna for taking away their vessel in this world. Henry took his own life so they couldn't take over his body again. That's what the note said. And then they went after your grandmother. I know it was them. You and your father are next if you don't get rid of them. I'm sorry Margaret. This is all just sounding a little too crazy. You have to burn them! And then you have to get as far away from this place as possible. Do you understand? No, I don't think I do! Well then, there's nothing I can do to help you. Margaret, wait. Margaret! Margaret, wait. What's going on, you alright? Um, no, not really. Why, what's up? This lady who knew my grandma was just here. Who, Margaret? You know her? Yeah, she's bat shit crazy. Seriously? Yeah, she's a total nut job. Why, what'd she say to you? She talk to you about her crazy brother? Yeah, said he had multiple personalities. Look, don't listen to any of what she says, alright? You just gotta shew her away. She kinda freaks me out about something in the house. Think you could like, come in for a minute? Yeah. Thanks. Come check this out. Is that one of the dolls from the book? Yeah, it is one of the little Attic Dolls. What are you doing down here, man? Don't you live in the attic? Don't do that. Just... What's going on, Sammey? What'd Margaret say to you? OK, she told me the dolls are possessed or cursed and I swear, it's like every time I'm looking away, they're up to something. Really? It was a really freaky story! OK so, what are you trying to tell me, that the dolls are alive like in the book? No, I just been feeling a little off and she freaks me out at a bad time. Well I think you've got proof that she's nuts and you've got nothing to be afraid of. I, on the other hand, have to worry about your unstable father. He's not that unstable. Really? OK, we're both super unstable. But he's harmless. Yeah well, not if he catches us like this. Look I'm gonna get going. I got some stuff I gotta take care of. Visit me after? My Dad's not coming back until later. Uh, I'll see. Watch out for those evil dolls. That's not funny. I'll come by after. Dope. Okay, let's leave you down here. Sammey? Sammey? What are you doing here? Checking in. Something came up and I have to fly to Boston for a few days. Neat. Can I come in for a minute? Whatever makes you jolly. Wanna blame me for everything, is that it Sammey? No Mom, no it's Dad's fault. He got so drunk that you blacked out and fell on a dick or seven. We were already separated, honey. Right. God, this place is creepy. I never liked it here. Yeah that's great, Mom. Is there anything else? Actually yes. I spoke with Dr. Miller. Here we go, OK. And he says it's dangerous to stop taking your medicine cold turkey. Of course he does. That's where doctors get all their money. Uh, no one is forcing you to take the pills, honey, but it's safer for you to ween yourself off of them. There are serious risks. This is so naive. Stop acting like your dad! This is serious! Where is your father? That's none of your business really. Look, I know you love your dad and you should. He's a good man, a really good one. He just hasn't been able to heal properly. Yeah, after the way you treated him, what do you expect? That's not what I mean, Sammey. Look, when your dad was little, his dad left. Robert threw himself into his drawings as a way to deal with it. Then his father died and they never made amends. So your father has this big, empty spot inside of him, Sammey. It's really hard on him. I tried to fill that empty spot but I failed, so you have every right to hate me. I never stopped loving your father and I'm not gonna hang him out to dry. But he needs to come through before we can have that conversation. So what, you and your greedy attorney will lay off of him? If he can help himself, I will renegotiate all of the terms. And if you can help him, I fully support that and I trust you. Really? Not only that, I just need you to be there for him. I have to catch a flight. Please... If you get sick or anything please call me, OK, please just... Yes, OK. What Dr. Miller said really scared me. Promise me? I promise. Thank you. Tell your dad I came by. You holding an ax behind your back? How'd you guess? Wait a second, what are these? Damn, so much for my murder plans So much for your murder plans. Come this way. What's wrong? Uh, just, maybe we should slow down just a little bit. Still worried about my dad? Well uh, yeah. I told him I'd be respectful. He gave me this gig and he might frown upon this. Maybe we could hang out somewhere a little less provocative. County fair just started. You like cotton candy? More of a funnel cake gal. I've never had funnel cake. You've never had it? I grew up pretty sheltered. OK, we need to fix your childhood right now. I am down for that. Let's do it. OK. Oh um, I need to change. You should probably go downstairs. Yes ma'am. OK. - Alright bye bye. - OK. Alright, I'll be down here. The Attic Dolls live up the stairs. You'll hear them laugh and run up there. But when you go upstairs to play, they'll be standing still each day. If you turn your back on them, you'll hear them run around again. And if you get to see them move, that is when they'll come for you. You can't hide from the Attic Dolls. They'll watch you from inside the walls. When you try to run from them, that's when the real fun begins. You'll wish you hadn't come to stay. When you look away, they play. James? James? James? Oh my God James, what happened? Oh my God, oh my God. James, James, look at me. James no. James, James, James, James, James. It's OK, shh. What do you want? Leave me alone! It's OK, just leave me alone please! Please, someone help! Dad, help me! What do you want? Leave me alone! Dad, please just go! Sammey, are you hurt? Baby, what happened? It was the dolls. What are you talking about baby? Did he attack you? No, no, it wasn't me. I didn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Slow down. Margaret came earlier and she said they were cursed. She told me they were cursed and I saw one of them come alive and she said they killed your mom. I think he's dead. I'm so sorry, honey. This isn't real life on your medication. I'm so sorry. I know what I saw, it wasn't me! It was the dolls. They're right out there right now Dad! It's OK, I don't wanna hear any more stories about dolls or anything. I need you to help me with this alright? I need you to go upstairs. I need you to get cleaned up and I need you to change out of that dress and bring it to me. We're going to burn it. What are you going to do? Make it right. No one's gonna put my child into prison. You understand me? I can take care of this. You gonna trust me? You can trust me Sammey. Yes, yes. I trust you. I need you to trust me. It's gonna be alright, baby. It's gonna be alright. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be alright. Just go upstairs and get cleaned up, sweetheart. None of this is your fault. I need you to do this, OK? I need to do this. Alright now, let's go, let's go. Hey, it's Sammey. Leave a message if you're cool. Hey, I don't know why neither of you are picking up your phones, but I missed my flight. I have to catch an early one and you guys are so much closer to the airport, so... Thank you ma'am, so much. Have a great night. Five star rating's appreciated. Hello? Hello? It's me, I missed my flight. Don't be scared. Hello? Hello? Oh, nice. Robert? Sammey? Hello, hello? Hey, it's Sammey. Leave a message if you're cool. Well obviously you guys aren't home 'cause you're not taking my calls. By the way, I found a great tub, so you guys might find me in it 'cause I am so stressed from missing my flight. Okay, see you guys, bye! Good. What the fuck! Robert! Sammey, that's not funny! Mommy. Sammey? Sammey? Mommy. Let's play. Dad. Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad. It's OK baby, we're gonna be OK. No Dad, I need you to listen to me. What is it? Please burn them. Burn what? The attic dolls. I need you to burn them for me Daddy. Margaret's been trying to tell me. She said that the only way is to burn them and Tommy's been leaving us messages. He's been writing messages on the... OK, OK. Where are they? I put one in the closet. Stay right here. Be careful. Dad? Dad? I got em, all three. No, I only put one in there. What? I only put one in there. Sammey, just open the door. Thank you. Sammey, I lied to you. Your grandmother wanted you in her life more than anything. I couldn't forgive her, so I wouldn't allow it. And for that, I'm really sorry. Dad, ya know, whatever happened between the two of you, it'll never happen with us. Promise? Promise. OK Monkey, get to bed and get some rest. Night. Goodnight. The Attic Dolls live up the stairs. You'll hear them laugh and run up there. But when you go upstairs to play, they'll be standing still each day. And if you turn your back on them, you'll hear them run around again. And if you get to see them move, that's when they will come for you. When you try to run from them, that's when the real fun begins. Sammey? Dad. You can't hide from the attic dolls. They'll watch you from inside the walls. Dad! Sammey. You'll wish you hadn't come to stay. When you look away, they play. Dad? When you reach the story's end is when we get inside your head. Dad? Sammey? Sammey! Dad! Sam! Sammey? In here. Sammey. In here. Oh Jesus, Lynn. Dad. Baby. Hello Robert. How you feeling today? How am I feeling? How would you feel if you were falsely convicted of murdering your entire family? Nobody believed me. I'm convicted of being criminally insane. How would you feel? You still don't remember anything from that night? Best I could. Something got inside of me. It wasn't me, I don't remember a thing, I don't! There's someone here to see you, Robert.
