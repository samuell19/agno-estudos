although I'm quite happy about myself, every week, a depressing thing hits my life. This depressing thing is called Sunday. Sunday is such an absolute, existential void, that the best thing to do is to lose half of it. Rosine, guess who's coming for lunch. a Sunday morning surprise is not my idea of paradise. But at least, it's less hellish than usual. Get zucchini flowers. - I'II deep-fry them, as a starter. - OK. Morning. Hello, son. Not sleeping round the clock today? - What's all this frenzy? - Your brother's coming for lunch. J?r?my's traveling 600 km only to spend Sunday with us? Fishy! When you get a job, you'II want to relax at your parents' now and then. - What if it's bad news? - What if it's good news, actually? Where have I put the keys? You should go back to bed. Up at 9 Sunday morning is a bit brutal. Parents are funny. They may be the only people you can admire... and find tacky at the same time. TlMES HAVE BEEN BETTER J?r?my! How are you? - Good. You? - Alright. - You in Gironde on a rotten Sunday? - Why? - Can't I come without warning? - You're not an improviser. I'm going to tell them the truth. What? Just like that? They must suspect it. Your campaign was a hit. You're their robot programmed for success. You want to do them in today or what? I don't know. Actually, I do. I'm living with someone. Say that and they'll think it's a girl. No, they're open-minded. Because they're left-wing? No, but... Mom has a gay colleague. I don't want to burst your bubble, but it's part of a parent's role to freak out. J?r?my. Want me to come with you? What? And say it for me, as well? Look at this. Ch?teau Les Vieux Rocs '73, the year you were born. A bit too much for today, isn't it? I've been saving it for a special occasion: a wedding, a birth... It's all up to you. Guy... The capon is smoking a lot. Not good for its lungs... So what will we drink? This one's very good. Actually... I have something to tell you. Robin, come here now! I bet you knew it before us. Yeah... PIus, he said it will be in a magazine. His photo and all. Are we talking about... Exactly, my new job! Head of Mergers and Acquisitions for a big investment bank. At 33! I say, hats off! Anything else? I'm moving. 150 m2, third district of Paris. Why didn't you say it before? I was worried. To all big changes in your life. Mom never dares to ask J?r?my directly if he's met a girl or wants children. So she sounds him out with banalities. That's a big apartment. Won't you feel lonely in it? With my job, I'm hardly ever there. I only sleep in it really. How many bedrooms? Only one. In 150 m2! It's a loft. It's ready, Iet's eat. Bring your glasses. It must be nice. - Great coming out... - Well, you try it. Sorry, I have no scoop to make. Tell them you smoke. Dad knocks down whiskey and Mom, pills. Gotta believe life is beautiful. You don't have to tell them today. You've only wasted an afternoon. Shut up. Hey, you're not at your bank. Here, chill out. Make the most of your stay here. They're soaking wet! His clothes will never dry in time. Let him relax. Look at that: a bank manager! They'll catch a cold. Old folks' sexuality sucks! You little pervert! I think they're in great form. Especially Dad. I wonder what Mom would do without him. I don't know what he would do without her. He'd live a life with no fears. Everything would always be very clear, simple and well organized. The most banal Iife in the world. Honestly, he'd be so bored! Tag, you're it! I didn't make enough food or what? Soccer makes you hungry. And he bursts laughing... It's a fine Iine between gifted child and half-wit. Yes, and you're not on the right side. I couldn't put your nice shirt in the dryer. Thanks, Mom. - Hey, don't steal my shirt! - Don't worry. My secretary will mail it to you first thing in the morning. Nice shirt for your position. "Hello, I'm J?r?my Dumar, head of M&A." Stop it, he must go. Can I take him in your 4x4, Dad? Drive carefully. We were very happy you turned up out of the blue... - No speeches, he must go. - Let me say we're proud of him. Listen, now that you've made it professionally, you could start thinking about our grand-children. In fact, I live with someone. His name's Marc. It's a man. There, now you know it. What are you doing here? What? You invited us to see the prodigy! Who? - How are you? - Good. What's up? J?r?my's become head of Mergers and Acquisitions. You bugger! You must be proud. Let's go, the train won't wait. You don't seem to accept it. Accept what? Can't be easy for a Ieft-wing HRD to have a son in the system. Are you happy? Happy is not the word. I'm no coming-out expert, but you could've been bolder. That's my business. You drop the bomb and run to Paris. Shame you won't see the damage, it's gonna be fun. They'll come to terms. Thing is, you're never here, so you're now a legend. Legends don't like dick. You'll be fine with them? Yeah, providing they don't order grand-children now. Are you OK? Nothing serious? Mom, I'm perfectly healthy. J?r?my, we love you. We only want you to be happy. It'd be too cruel to tell your parents they're not convincing. How can they be happy for something that makes them so unhappy? I'm cold. Robin knew it. Did you suspect it? Deep down I think I did. Nice of you to warn me... I did talk to you about it. About how he never had anyone. But with you, if he had bronchitis, it was pneumonia, a stiff neck was meningitis, if he felt tired, he was depressed... So obviously, not married meant queer. - Don't use that word. - What should I say? Homosexual. I'm sorry. Come here. It's not that bad. It could've been worse. He could've had a car crash, an orphan disease, cancer, died in a terrorist attack... - Stop it! - What? What are you saying? Listing the worst things that could kill a child? AII this time, he hid his real Iife from us, his parents. You think sleeping pills are the answer? at a certain stage ofyour life, a sleepless night means party. It's great fun. Bugsy buggery bollocks! Then when you're past the age of partying all night, not sleeping is real agony. When you finally fall asleep... without fail... it's time to get up, because life goes on. Did you manage to sleep? With the pills, very well. Nicole's coming to dinner. What shall I get? Can't you call it off? Not every time. The freezer's full, isn't it? This goddam life goes on. a new head The good surprise AII the girls must be trying to catch him. You must be proud of your son. Such a successful son! It's almost a biological miracle. How on earth did a guy Iike you have such a bright son? You told everyone? Like you wouldn't... Instead of a divorce and a problem son, in my next Iife, I want a nice little family, a brilliant son, but I'II keep my freedom and the chicks. Your nice Iittle family wouldn't last. You'd soon find yourself with your own nice little life. The staff demand for a pay rise put you in a bad mood? And Rosine? How can she manage? As you like contemporary art, write the article on the retirement home exhibit. Aren't I kind? And there's a nice news item here: an obese women was stuck in her bathtub all night. The rescuers used twelve Iiters of oil to free her. We'll put a photo of the rescuers. They're so cute! OK, Rosine, what's the matter with you? Yesterday, J?r?my came to tell us that he was... Iike you. Bald? Did you wait to tell your parents? I waited so Iong that they died before. I'm sorry. You know, I have a sister who's a nutcase. I don't ask you any questions to understand her just because you're straight like her. When did you and I meet? Must have been six months ago, right? I can't become your consultant on homosexuality just like that. Besides, your son and l... have nothing in common. You're annoying me. Cover the movie at Ch?teau de Vayres tomorrow. It will be relaxing for both of us. - Where are you going? - Out with my buddies. Can't you stay once? For dinner with Nicole? Are you mad? I'm not a passive smoker. It's J?r?my? Quite a blow, uh? I'm not gay pride generation. But you had 68, sexual liberation, all that. Sexual Iiberation was something else. A pretext to have sex with lots of girls! You guys got it all wrong. It took a disease for you to acknowledge gay guys. I've never had a problem with that, but when he's a son... Hi, what have you been up to? Just waiting for college. OK, see you. Flowers suit you. They do. Rosine's coming soon. She's finishing a story. Will we eat outside? Shall I take the plates out. You know the house. Sure. He needed time to tell you, that's all. It's public now? I know it was a shock, but you never suspected it? You'd guessed it as well? If I had children, I'd wonder about those things. J?r?my went out with girls. And it wasn't platonic. I assumed that question had been settled. But when he was at college, there was Eric. Eric! Mrs. Lechabre's son! They were so close to each other! Eric was his best friend. Do you also think Robin sleeps with his friends? Why not? Eric's a homosexual. His mother knows it and she doesn't hide it. Why didn't J?r?my tell us? Perhaps he doesn't know what he is. I think he likes girls too. You do? He may be bisexual or "bi", as they say. I don't believe in bisexuality! An American researcher proved that sexuality is defined by fluids in the brain. And by dissecting homosexuals... They dissect homosexuals? He's like a coroner. He observed that gay men's brains are heavier. There's more water! Will you ever stop talking so much bullshit? Hello, Dad. Hello, son. Are you OK? About yesterday? We've seen better days, but we'll be fine. It'd be nice if you and Mom, next weekend... could meet Marc. Who's Marc? My boyfriend. Actually, we have a barbecue on Saturday. Can't introduce him to everyone yet. Come for lunch on Sunday. Too many abstract questions... will make you overlook the concrete ones. How can anyone make love to a man? Indeed. How? I'm sorry I shouted at Nicole. I didn't want to talk to her about that. Not today. We must talk about it. Have you told anyone? Pascal, for instance? It's not his business. Are you ashamed of your son? Are you OK? I've taken a sleeping pill. Talk to me if you need to. Do you think J?r?my... What? Do you think he gets buggered? How can he think about that? Can that be his main concern? Men only think about sex. And that's not a clich?. You guys don't really do it anymore, do you? This questions his son's virility. That affects his image of himself. A truly virile man wouldn't worry about sodomites. Sugar? No, thanks. We're talking about his son! Besides, Guy's too sensitive. A male chauvinist is what he is. Hates being challenged. Especially by a woman. He should talk to his friends about it. Are you joking? Why do men do sports together? To confide in each other, do you think? Can you see them talking about their innermost feelings? They're verbally handicapped. You're exaggerating. You think so? What's wrong? Sleeping pills. - Not used to them. - You have... What? A problem? No. Well... I do. With... With Rosine. Shit! A relationship problem. Serious? Listen, don't worry. Well... See ya. What? It was good to talk. Sure, man. Any time. You want me on the shoot with you? You can do the interview? My son Robin wants to go with me. Remember that our newspaper shows the local dynamism. No offense meant, but you've been scary lately. Alright, go ahead. You Iook Iike you were St Rosine, patron saint of gay men's moms. Ask me whatever you want, but drop that look. No, we're not friends. We're having a barbecue. - I'd Iike you to... - Stop. That's very kind... but a weekend barbecue with the local bourgeoisie is a bit my idea of hell on earth. You understand? Can't you be nice for at least five minutes? At last! I like it when you get angry. Very sexy... You coming on Saturday? I'll think about it. With all the cable programs now, shouldn't TV change a bit? You're right. Guy, I don't know how many people will come on Saturday. No, I'm working. I'll call you back. Isn't your mother the interviewer? I can't shut this down. You just close it, Mom. Sorry. One more question... Did you choose the Ch?teau de Vayres because of S?bastien d'Artenay? The famous 15th century poet who lived here. No, sorry. We're ready to shoot. - Excuse me. - Thanks, I'll send you the article. Mom, can we just watch a scene? Why don't you stay on the set this morning? Everybody in position, please. Mathilde, ready? Emmanuel, ready? - Can we shoot? - Yeah. OK, everybody ready. Silence, please. Shooting! Shooting! Silence! "Gallants and Courtesans". Take one. Action! OK. Cut! Very good. Back to your initial positions, we'll do it again. How are you? Taking it easy? Yeah, I'm fine. Mom took me to a film shoot. It was awesome! I'm meeting them for a drink. - Wouldn't you rather mow the Iawn. - Yeah, sure. What? Is it urgent? Been asking you for two days. You're not in a hotel. You chose not to work this summer. Well, own it. I can still ask you to help me. He's really pissing me off. He doesn't like to see you tan. I love it. You look great. A bit of color is nice. You protect your skin? Of course, Mom. I'm always safe. Be nice to your father. He's in a bad way. I'll be nice if he's nice. Come on. You've done a great job! You're the one who inherited my dexterity. I'm not the family genius. I'm an ordinary guy good at manual jobs. I really enjoy the time we spend working together. Your brother left so early. I focused so much on his schooling that I lost him too early. When he told you... didn't you ask him why he was that way? You should ask him directly. I'm not his press attach?. To think that... As a man, can you understand the things he does in bed? What's that to do with you? He's my son. I should care. I've never asked you if you bugger Mom. You're not open-minded, you're a loser! Why did you hit Robin? You don't want to know. Were you pestering him with your sexpert questions about J?r?my? Obviously, you're not into that anymore. I have other concerns, let me tell you. Sorry I'm a half-wit who is still in working order. What's wrong with you? Hey fatty, your potbelly's growing. You don't like me anymore? In fact, your tubbiness turns me on. Get off! Alright, Guy? I haven't told you... It's J?r?my. He's queer. We'd never have guessed it. I wouldn't either. It doesn't show. That's what counts. As Iong as it doesn't stop him having a normal life. In fact, his Iife is better than normal. And what does his... boyfriend do? I don't know... He's an art student, I think. A young one. He has the role of the woman. Not J?r?my. What do you know? He knows that he doesn't wear the pants at home. You idiot... Trust me, Guy. There's usually a queen and a man. J?r?my is obviously the man. But that doesn't explain what we did wrong. Perhaps it wasn't you. What do you mean? Those guys usually have a very strict father. That's not you. Or an overprotective mother... who pampered them. He was six months in hospital when he was born. Nearly died. That leaves a mark on any mother. We're not criticizing Rosine. It's just a fact. Take Robin. That one never caused us the slightest concern. He's always healthy. Even Rosine had to be laidback about him. And he likes girls. Doesn't he? Still here? Yeah, he helped us to wrap up. They need someone in production. Would you like that? Absolutely! That's settled then. What are you looking at? How can a bright woman Iike you read that? It helps me unwind, it's amusing. "My serial fucker phase", you identify with that? Did it help talking to your friends? Whatever girls' magazines say, the need to feel your wife's skin is a type of sexuality too. When that desire disappears... Iife fortunately has its compensations: the pleasure of working... Check the results! We can't give you that rise now! Always the same old fucking story! You're forcing a strike. Fuck you! Who by, Guy? ...your relationship with your son... Remember the barbecue. I'm working tomorrow. How come? I was hired on the movie. Do you ever listen to me? ...the delights of adultery... Well, what's it gonna be today? A pack of cigarettes. Which brand? I don't know... A good one... ...a simple friendship... What's the matter? Pascal told me a joke. Do you know how to spot a gay wedding? Keeping me out of your jokes now? Can't you keep your mouth shut, you idiot? Wait up, Guy. So even if life goes on, sometimes you must admit it has changed a bit. Serge is bringing the whole tribe. We need more sausages and chipolatas. You're smoking again! If you hate the smoke, why are you always with Nicole? I thought you'd gone away this weekend. Well, I lied to you. I'd have your suicide on my conscience if I'd said I didn't want to go to your barbecue. Mrs. Lechabre! Hello. How's Eric? Fine. He and his boyfriend run a hair salon in Paris. How about your son? He's fine. He has a boyfriend too. Excuse me, but I have a long shopping list. You're hopeless at cruising. I've always tried to stand back, not to suffocate my son with my fears. Now, that uptight bourgeois is closer to her gay son than me. Rosine, don't get yourself into such a state. Otherwise, I'II feel I have to go to your barbecue... I'd be so happy, Yvan. I mean it. OK, but I'm only being politically correct. Someone must represent the minorities in your party. - What time? - At one. It's very kind of you. Help me choose a new frock. How are you? - Nicole! - You're looking great! - I'm so happy to see you. - So am l. We've had a good start. Look... What's that bottle? How can he always find a cuter girl than the previous one? Your son's a real lady's man. I just hope he won't drink all the wine. There's Serge. You're already drunk! Well done! - For you. - Thank you. Have you met my husband? Hello, Yvan. You shouldn't drink too much. I didn't find the sausages and chipolatas in your basket. I forgot them. Do you ever do anything right? Don't leave me alone, please. I don't know anyone and that woman is very scary. Hello, I'm Nicole. You must be Yvan. So you're Rosine's torturer? We have at Ieast one thing in common. You'd never got me down in front of other people. What's wrong? Stop drinking. You'll be sick. Is this really about the sausages? It's J?r?my, right? You've changed since he came. I know it's something that affects your virility... Nicole put those ideas in your head? - Guy, the barbecue! - Shit! A bit overcooked. Guy, it's burning. Fuck! It's all your fault! Are you OK, darling? I'll put these in water. Talk about a barbecue... Imagine what they'll say. Never mind the barbecue. But tomorrow, with J?r?my and his boyfriend, you'd better be nice. Shit! Fuck! Stop thinking about the party. That happens. Just don't let that idiot win. You bugger! Sorry, Guy. Stop it, apologizing is worse! He just wanted to show some consideration for you. Consideration for me? Fuck your consideration. You pity me? You're completely paranoid, pal. My turn to serve. Wait... Come on, spit it out. You'll feel better afterwards. A queer son, what a shame, uh? A son in jail wouldn't be as bad. Asshole! Yeah, asshole... What's your problem? What? No, wait! One of your daughters will turn out dyke. You wanted a son? Better watch it. Guy, you know what time it is? There's one way to psyche yourself up to meet your queer son's lover: to knock back alone a Ch?teau Les Vieux Rocs '73 in your cellar. If you don't want to come, just say it. I hope Marc is not too effeminate. Excuse me? I just hope he's not a queen. Paris! Don't you know the way? It's funny... you spend your life moving forward with a man, and one day you realize you're next to him, but going in a different direction. It takes one obstacle for you to realize you're worlds apart. - How are you? - Fine. Come on in. Hello. Mom and Dad, this is Marc. One tries not to scream with horror the other one, with laughter. This way, please. The sitting room. It opens directly onto the garden. It must be very nice in summer. To discover your son's real life at his place, feels as weird as ifyou were visiting a stranger's apartment. The difference is, you don't want to know about their private life. The bedroom. Very original. Isn't it, Guy? We have the same switches at home. That's a drilling module, right? It's a 34-420. Our factory made them. Marc likes industrial art. What an interesting photo! A famous artist? Not yet, but soon. It's Marc's work. Congratulations. J?r?my said you liked contemporary art. Isn't it beautiful, Guy? Which part of the body is it? Does that really matter? The body seems palpable, we only know fragments of someone else's body. Like a feeling, you want to grasp it totally, but it's always eluding you. Right? That's a portrait of J?r?my. Still holding that bottle? And I am absent-minded. I'm fine, thanks. Some more? You're a student? I don't Iook it and I'm past the age. Marc had an advertising agency. He sold it to study plastic arts. I'd worked so hard that one day I had enough of it. So I decided to do what I really like: art and cooking. This is very good. Guy also cooks very well. J?r?my often compares us. Not to my advantage. You started cooking a year ago, while Dad's cooked us tasty dishes for 30 years. Years of experience. He cooks singing his head off, in a big flowery apron. Someone has to use it. Whoever gave it to you was really stupid. Goodbye. Bye, get home safe. - Thank you. - Welcome. Was it horrible or fine? A bit of both, I guess. That's normal, isn't it? What did you think of my father? It's not easy for him. But I Ioved what he said about the drilling modules. Shut up. I thought you'd explain the photo. Sometimes, it helps to play the intellectual. My mother? Your mother is mad about you. It's painful for her not to express that. I wouldn't like to be in her shoes. Introducing your parents isn't a great aphrodisiac. It was hard for them. It was hard, but they came. They came here for you. You realize how far they drove? You realize how lucky you are? Yeah... I'm lucky. You're here. You sound like a robot saying that. It's funny... - My brother says the same. - You see? He must be very smart. Come into my arms, Grendizer. A coffee, please. A double scotch. You're driving. A coffee, then. There was an empty hole in my life. My son Ioved no one. No one loved him. Now that hole's gone. The apron wasn't to hurt you. You did. I even Iike it when you don't try to be like every man. I'm sorry. I didn't understand your feelings as a father. Tell me what you thought of Marc. Despite all your questions. I think nothing about Marc. It's as if my son had died. You want something? You know everyone here hates you? Never mind. I hate them too. I have another project lined up. If you want, you can be trainee director. - What enthusiasm... - I'm going to college. Forget it, then. But I'm interested. You're young. College is important. But I'm not sure I want to go to college. Only you can decide that. We're ready to rehearse. Everyone ready for rehearsal, please. When do you start losing track ofyour son's real life? When do you first decide not to insist because he won't talk? Meeting Marc didn't help? Not to blot out these years of silence. And Eric! One day, he was gone. He was so sad, just wanted to be all alone. I missed out on his 1st love. Stop it. You don't know what happened. Give me that pot. And Guy's getting worse. Drowning himself in problems I can't understand. A huge gap has opened between us. That anal sex thing again? That gap has existed for some time. You simply ignored it. You adored Guy, I know that. But seriously, I never understood your marriage. Thank you... I offended you. I don't ask you to understand everything, but don't say I've failed my Iife like that holding a flower. You know nothing about Guy and l. Words don't explain it. Not yours, at any rate. Goodbye. Ogitech on strike! Ogitech on strike! OK, call you back later. Morning. So, have you met your daughter-in-law? I thought you weren't interested. Are we cranky today? Wanna talk about the barbecue? About puking on flowers. Since you insist, Marc is very nice and they're very happy. Don't kid yourself, Rosine. It won't last. Why? Because they will never have what makes a straight couple rot together: children. They'll have their little projects. Traveling, redecorating, adopting a Labrador... But honestly, is that enough to keep a couple together? Yvan, I'm sick of the horrible things you say. You asked for my views on homosexuality. Sorry if I sound na.ive, but I still believe my son won't end up like you. A bitter old queen! Great atmosphere... Don't you have tennis? Didn't feel like it. The director offered me a job on another movie. You're Iucky to be able to study and you will. Be a traveling artist Iater, that's up to you. Can't we at least talk? What's going on? Thanks to you, your son wants to drop college to work in show biz. I must think. I want to do something that I like, and succeed in life. You should've done better at school then. Like J?r?my? You wish I were like him, but not too much, right? You Iike this movie-making thing because it's new. I just wanted to talk to him. What you said about J?r?my was not nice. I'm sick of your problems with J?r?my. And I don't want to wait around to start living, like he did. Hello, darling. It's your mother. Is this a bad time? I'd like to see you. Hello. Do you have an appointment? A blow-dry? Eric, you remember me? J?r?my's mother. I'm having lunch with him. Your mother gave me your address. I'm not Eric, I'm Alain. Mind you, this often happens. Look. I see. Come with me. I don't want to make you spend, but your hair needs a lot of work. I'll take care of it. - How are you? - Good. - Your hair. - You like it? It's different, but nice. As I was coming to Paris, I got Eric's address from Mrs. Lechabre. You remember Eric? - I do. - He wasn't there. His boyfriend is Iovely, though. He did my hair. We never spoke about Eric, but I suspected something. Eric was only a friend, Mom. But you fell out so suddenly. I simply realized he was stupid. Isn't that a good reason? You haven't said anything about Marc. Our New York lawyers will call me. You know I have many problems on this case. I'll be there in 45 minutes. Marc? Yes, Marc... We liked him very much. Are you sure? I thought Dad was a bit strange. He has other worries. Robin wants to drop school to work on a movie. What an idiot. What are you having? a mother can bear the awful distance that may separate her from her son if she clings to what makes her a woman: a loving and understanding husband... a fascinating job and thoughtful colleagues... her girlfriends... But when all that vanishes, isn't that a sign that she must do something about her life? Guy... I didn't say it but I went to Paris to see J?r?my to talk about us. But we should solve our problem ourselves. What problem? When J?r?my was born, we got through six horrible months together. You were the only person I wanted. And despite our differences, I've always wanted to be with you. But when you said it was as if your son had died, I had the feeling I was living with a stranger. Why do you accept it so easily? Because he's my son and I Iove him just the way he is. You've changed. And you haven't? It's been so Iong you don't even remember. Since J?r?my was born, precisely. Where's the girl I married? That girl who made me jump over the fence to make love in the pool? Jesus! AII my Iife I'II wish I'd never heard this. Don't mind me. I won't be long. I just wanted to say I'll take the job. I'll drop college. Even your brother thinks it's a bad idea. If you Iike movies, you can go to a film school. Don't bother, Rosine. I gave my Iife for my sons. And now: a temp worker and a faggot. - Guy... - Don't start. Has he always been this stupid or is this new? He's pissing in the garden! I think he's seriously depressed. No, his fate's caught up on him. He's turned into the Ioser he truly is. What's going on, Guy? You're not yourself. Perhaps, I'm actually being myself, and I've always tried to be different just to please you. This may be our Iast chance to be good parents. Cut that specialist crap, I'm a man. I can't be like you, happy that my son's like that. I'II get used to it, but till then, leave me alone! Don't you wonder why the son you always protected turned out a faggot? You think I'm to blame? You with your fears, your worries, your looks, the bane of my life! No wonder J?r?my never said it. He didn't want you interfering. I've Iugged you around for years. I've had enough. No point getting a stupid new haircut! You want a handkerchief? Those things I said at the office... I'm sorry. Why do you apologize? It's true! I'm a bitter old queen. Come on, Rosine... I have a bad reputation here. You mustn't spoil it. Come inside. I'll take your stuff. Jesus! You've brought all your silverware or what? Don't blame yourself because your son's gay and didn't tell you. First of all, he did. And there's no legal age for that kind of thing. You've no reason to be sorry because he hid it. It's normal. And don't flatter yourself thinking you made him gay. You, an overpossessive mother? You'd been incapable of that. You're too kind, too reserved. Nicole says I'm passive aggressive. Obviously! She likes to be active aggressive. That friend of yours is utterly mad. If you Iisten to her, you're screwed. As for your husband... when it comes to couples... can't say I'm an expert. Not on relationships in general. In that area, I'm totally useless. You annoy me, but talking to you is stimulating. You know why your son won't end up like me? Because he has a fantastic mother. And you know, in my opinion, if as a child you're used to... Ioving and being Ioved... you need that all your life. It doesn't matter if it's a man, a woman or a dachshund. And your parents? I'd have Iiked them to have all possible faults, Iike all good parents. They were just disappointing. The worst thing! You've done very well. I think you're wonderful. You're a real fag hag! Tonight I'm seeing friends in Paris. You can stay here. Thank you. Mind you... you should show off your new hairdo. You'll like my friends. You need a few minutes? No, I'm fine. No more of that post-bath Brittany Spaniel look. From now on, blow-dry every morning, hairdresser once a week. Like Mrs. Lechabre. This is a lovely gay place. I'm not the bashful virgin you think I am. OK, next time I'II take you to a leather bar. You think J?r?my and Marc come here? How do you want me to know? Here you are. Thank you. Nice colors. I said no drinks for her. She's so protective! Rosine's very fragile. She's been through a huge drama as a mother. My eldest son told us that he had a boyfriend. Goodness, how awful... Go talk to him. Puts you in a good mood. You keep Iooking at each other. You'll end up spoiling it. I came with Rosine. So what? She's a big girl. You think she needs a chaperon? Rosine? Go have some fun. Only because you asked. Good luck. May I ask you an indiscreet question? Certainly. Was it hard to accept your homosexuality? Very hard. I like women too much. I don't feel very well. Feeling better? Yes, I am. I needed some fresh air. Why are you here if you're not gay? And yourself? Shall we walk a bit? How about Yvan? You saw him with that other guy. You're not in his thoughts. But don't worry, I'll take you to your hotel. OK? - I'm 50 and married with children. - You're a woman, Rosine. And incredibly attractive. We're alone by the river at 5 in the morning. I think you're so beautiful. There are some rare moments in life when you feel a different woman. Or rather, the woman you forgot you were a long time ago. Hello, J?r?my. This is your mother. I know it's too early to bother you, but I need to talk to you. Where are you? Dad's been after you. Robin's left home. He drove away in the 4x4. What's going on? Are you all out ofyour minds? But those rare moments when you're another woman never last. and when you're yourself again, you pay dearly. Where were you? What's happening? My train leaves soon, I'll call when I get home. Since the week-end you went to see us, nothing's been right. Calm down now. One out of two has already been found. If only a family problem could be solved as easily as an equation. Stop torturing yourself like that. She said I was to blame for what was happening. Did you really think your coming out would go smoothly? They came over for lunch. You even said it'd gone fine. They've gone from "My bachelor son works in finance" to "My gay son lives in a loft with a photo of his butt by his boyfriend." Rather brutal, isn't it? I can spend hours predicting figures and results, but not their reaction. How stupid! That's not stupid. That's human. I'd freak out if you calculated all your feelings. Mad parents divided by irresponsible brother, times failed coming out: family equation impossible to solve. Everyone's looking for you! Well, I'm here. Where the hell have you been? I went out clubbing. Unbelievable! You've all gone crazy or what? Hey Mr. Robot, shut up! Wait, calm down. Hi, I'm Marc. Personally, I call him Grendizer. Check out this apartment. It's awesome! No, the car's intact. Want some? Don't worry, I'll send him home. Kiss. I managed to calm Dad down. You sleep a bit then you drive back. No, I don't want to see them. They're too crazy. You'll take the car back. You do that. This is all your fault! Will you explain why it's my fault? You don't get it? You're not that smart after all. Living in your shadow was fine, but your news changed everything. They love you as much. Parents never admit they have a favorite son, but deep down... You're lucky to be gay. You're not what they want and they can't change that. But they believe they can mold me. You mustn't drop out of school. I'm only 18, dammit! I can try something for one year. College helps you form your character. Yeah, it formed yours alright. For 30 years you hid from your parents! Anyway, I'm sick of all this. Don't worry about the noise, I'm a sound sleeper. Wow... Quite a personality! I wouldn't worry about him. But you should see your parents. I think they deserve some of your time. Robin's at J?r?my's. He'd gone to Paris. Now where were you? In Paris. Popular destination these days. I was with a man. I kissed him. You know everything now. Rosine! Mom and Dad, I'm gay. I had no choice, that's how it is. Too harsh. Mom and Dad, I love you. I didn't want to hurt, I should have talked to you... Oh fuck! The fucking radar! For fuck's sake! Mom's not in? We need to talk. Go ahead. All of us together. She's not here. What can I do? She's gone. You didn't know? Come on, say what you have to say. I know that... I didn't... She went out with a guy. Pardon? Your mother. She spent the night in Paris with a guy. Unbelievable! - How do you know? - She told me. She swore it was only a kiss. Does she think I'm stupid! Can't be serious. She wants a divorce. Shall I talk to her? No, not that. Is she at Nicole's? She's at Yvan's. He works with her. Where is it? Good morning. Sorry to bother you. I'm Rosine's son. I know who you are. Your mother's desk is full of photos of you gathering dust. Is she here? Follow me. She's in the bathroom. - Mind if I wait? - Sit down. Better in the photos. Thank you. For looking after her. She's unnerving, but I love her. You said something? Rosine's not home? She once Ieft a pair of those in my garden. Didn't even notice it when she left. Driving barefoot is risky. In the car, yeah. Of course it is. I think she avoided me in the market. We quarreled a bit. She's not well, you know? Of course you do. I get a bit too involved? When I married her, I knew I was doomed to see you. Perhaps my troubles aren't as interesting as yours. Besides, you have a nice house. Thanks, I've given up. Jesus! We'II never be on the same wavelength. Why didn't you talk to me about your troubles? How could l? You either clammed up or your phone wouldn't stop ringing. And why do I answer your questions? You never answered mine. I'm here now. We can talk, can't we? What did you do with this guy? He was there, he was kind. We talked all night and I kissed him. I can't remember Iast time I had that with your dad. Why stay together without that? Actually... you telling us the truth made me realize your dad and I had been living a lie. So much for the truth... Are you really happy with Marc? Will it last without children? Should it Iast only for the children? She didn't say when she'd come back? What did she tell you? I won't sum it up! If you need to talk, that's between you. I can't talk to her if she's away. I'm here. If you have any questions or want to say something... I'm happy to see you. How can I help you, Dad? I hope you'll be gentle with me. I'm out of practice. Perfect. I'm not in the mood to be made mincemeat of. You booked it? We don't want to be a nuisance. You're not. Let's play, don't be silly. Come on. How are you? We'll play directly. Out of practice, you bastard! My CEO says the same thing. We play every week. Keep on laughing... Ready? Shit! Hi, how's it going? I see you guys are having fun, unlike us. I Iove the photo of your butt as well. What? You told him? Yeah, he found it very funny. How about you? I haven't asked how you were. Great. I'm alone in my old bedroom when I was a teenager. Looking at an old Wham! poster. I was crap at math, but at least... I had a good taste in music. Your parents? Mom hasn't come home yet, despite the long talk we had. As for Dad, it's hard work to make him build a phrase. It feels weird to be here. I spent so much time revising in here. I Iike to imagine what you could do alone in that bedroom. Dream on... Even that was timed according to my revising. It's crazy... In fact, I have the feeling I really only started living not too long ago... when I met you. I love you too. Sleep tight. Your apron? I threw it away. It was too old. The flowers bothered you? It's silly, but at a certain age, we start losing our self-assurance. You know, sometimes I envy your mother. I don't. She's too disorganized. It takes strength not to be afraid of disorder. I don't mean the household chores. I try to make people believe I have my act together. But deep down I can't fool myself. She's much cleverer than me, although it doesn't show. She took it so naturally. Sometimes, it seems to be so easy for a woman to love her children as they are. Did she tell you... what I said after we'd met Marc? You see? She protected you. I said that for me, it was as if you'd died. You're right. I died. The man you wanted me to be has died. But I am here. Alive. And starving. I'll get a bottle of wine. You've been here for 10 minutes. This bottle will do for a bereavement as well. Let's go. I was afraid I'd missed you. We still have 15 minutes. With all this, we haven't talked about Robin, as usual. I think it's good for him to try something he likes. He's better at happiness than me. But I've made it. It'd be cool if you could trust him a bit more. Parents are weird. It's what happened between them that made us, and yet, there's a time when what happens between them doesn't concern you anymore.
