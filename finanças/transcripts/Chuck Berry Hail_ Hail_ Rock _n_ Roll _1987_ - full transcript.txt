If you were to try and give rock 'n' roll another name, you might call it Chuck Berry. Right. In the 1950s, a whole generation worshipped his music, and when you see him perform today, past and present all come together... and the message is, "Hail, hail, rock 'n' roll." Right on.

I remember driving by a place in Nashville. I must've been 16, driving home from a date, and, um, "Mabellene" was playing out-- You could hear it coming out of the club, you know, as we rolled by. And so we rolled down the window, stopped and used to listen. He's the King of Rock 'n' Roll. My mama even said that. I said, "What about me, Mama?" She said, "Well, now, son, you're ver-- you're different. You sing slow songs, but Chuck Berry's rock 'n' roll." I said, "Why, all this time, I thought I was." She said, "Well, your habits are pretty good, but you're no Chuck Berry." My favorite song with Chuck... is all of 'em. I like all of 'em! [ Laughing ] I-I've always-- Chuck, really, to be truthful, not puttin' Bo down, not puttin' Fats down, but if I didn't say this, God knows I'd be lyin'. To the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, my God that I love so much-- and I keep Your Holy Sabbath every Saturday... from sunrise to sunset-- I must say this: He's my favorite rock artist, and he always have been, and I think that-- I've never told the world this, but... his rhythm is the only rhythm that I can sing myself too. And it fits. If I say anything about Chuck, Chuck is-- If Chuck don't go up on stage, I know it's gonna be really tough on me. [ Little Richard Laughing ] Wow. So this is what you wanted to see. This is it: the Cosmopolitan Club. That's what 30 years can do for ya. Gee, birthplace of "Mabellene." Okay. ♪ Mabellene ♪ ♪ Why can't ya be true ♪ Jesus. Look at this. Wow. Oh, man, this breaks my heart. They must've had a flood here or something. Mmm, look at this place. My beautiful Cosmopolitan, and many beautiful nights as we had in here. Look at this. This is something. It's a far cry from the way it was when I was here back in '51, '52. Drew three to four hundred people every weekend-- Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Twenty-one dollars. We were here for three years. Three years. Johnnie Johnson Trio, until I took it over and it got to be Chuck Berry Trio. Chuck Berry came to me and asked me about changin' the name... from the Johnnie Johnson Trio to the Chuck Berry Trio, which, uh-- which was perfectly okay with me, because Chuck was more of a go-getter and, uh, he seemed to know more about the business than I did, and I figured with him as a leader we would have more jobs and a better success. [ Chuck ] I had two day jobs. I worked with my father... whenever I didn't have anything else to do. But mainly when I started working at the automobile plant, that's when the money started comin' in: $91 a week. I was cuttin' pretty good too, because I had a family, you know, and, uh, $21 here and $91 there-- A hundred dollars a week, you can do pretty good. Music is-- was a sideline, you know. I was a carpenter and a painter, you know. About a year after I started working here, uh, I asked-- I'm in the painting business, you know, fixing up. I had an idea about just putting the, uh, ceilings in black. And, uh, as I painted them black, I had the idea and went on on my own... to paint, uh, the top of it real dark, dark blue in ovals. And then at the high point of the oval, I just painted a snow-capped mountain, and they went all around this, all around, all the way around the building, excepting behind the bar where the mirrors are. I got $450 for that, and compared to $21 a weekend, that's like six months of playing. That's the reason why I'll never let that, uh, painting and decorating go. It's, uh, money. Money in that. [ Interviewer ] But there had to be something that drove you towards... trying to make a life as a professional musician. Oh, when the money got larger, I'd put the paintbrush down, pick the pick up and fiddle. [ Chuckles ] Oh, yeah. It got bigger. As a matter of fact, I left here... making $42 a night... and went straight to Gleason's Bar in Cleveland... at $800 a week. It felt great. When I showed my brother the contract, he said, "You mean to tell me-- Yeah, well, that's the way it is." From then on, I found out that you make more and more as the years go by. [ Woman ] Oh, baby! [ Whooping, Applauding ] That's what started me to thinkin' that I could go professional, because the crowds we had on the weekends were jam-packed. I said if I can do it here, I can do it in Cleveland, do it in Miami. And when I went up to Chicago where Leonard Chess and Chess records were, that was the launching of my career. I went up there with a $79 recorder and played that, you know, 'cause I'm not gonna play guitar in front of a stranger. Well, he said, "It sounds good." He was listening to the lyrics. And the name of the song, I had it named "Ida Red," not knowing that I couldn't name it the same title of a song already out. And "Mabellene" sounds just like "Ida Red" rhythmically, so I named it "Mabellene." And, uh, evidently he liked it, because he told me to get the band and come up and he'd consider a recording contract. I said, "When? Yesterday?" He said, "No. Whenever you can." So the next Friday, when Johnnie got off from his job, we went up there, and Saturday we recorded "Mabellene," "Wee, Wee Hours," "Too Much Monkey--" By the way, I had these songs written during that week. "Too Much Monkey Business" and, I think, "Roll Over, Beethoven." And, uh, we did all four of them in less than six hours. "Mabellene" had 36 takes, by the way. I remember. [ Interviewer ] You wrote four songs in one week? Oh, yeah. It wasn't too hard to write, because I'd been making up songs-- verses, that is-- on the bandstand to other people's songs. I'd take my verses and put 'em to the same rhythm and I was on my way. You know, poetry is my blood flow. We're gonna hear some blues tonight...

Naturally, I was the only writer, because it came from Missouri... in a basement in my house. And when the record came out, it was Russ Fratto and Alan Freed and Chuck Berry. You know, who are these guys, you know? I knew Alan Freed. I heard him on the radio. He was the disc jockey in New York that played the record. Who is Russ Fratto? He's-- He owns a stenography store-- a stationery store next to-- who supplied Leonard with his stationery. Uh, why they were on it didn't matter to me. I didn't know that was a split of the monies, but when I got my royalties, I saw one third. Anybody can easily figure it out. I'm good at mathematics. I was only-- I'm only getting a third of this, you know. So that was in the days of payola when, uh-- when you did something for somebody, you got a cut of whatever the issue was. Money-- You know, I'd sit up all night lookin' at the contracts, you know, tryin' to figure out how I was gonna make any money out of two-- two-- No, half a cent per record. Half a cent? Half a cent per record. We had to sell two records to make a penny. Right. A record cost 59 cents, didn't it? Yeah. Well, there were 58 other pennies going somewhere. Uh-uh. I, uh-- Ooh, boy. Yeah, I majored in math. I was lookin' at the other 58 cents. I majored in mouth. [ Laughing ] I was doin' the talkin' and no walkin'. Didn't make nothin'. Couldn't even understand the contract. I looked at it. All I wanted to see was "Little Richard." When I saw that, I didn't even read the other part. [ Chuck ] You feel your way when you don't know. Sometimes you step on rocks. Sometimes you get your head bumped. But not twice. That's a smart man. Don't let the same dog bite you twice. [ Man ] How ya doin', Chuck? Chuck's made a whole new show business, doing things on the road the Chuck Berry way. As a entertainer and as a businessman/entertainer, he just does things different than most people do. Chuck doesn't have a big entourage, doesn't have a band with him. He likes to go by himself, leaves the job by himself. You know, promoters offer limousines and such, and he doesn't care. This is Chuck Berry, that's all. This is just Chuck Berry doin' it his way. One-nighters, that's all I ever do. One-nighters. [ Interviewer ] Where's all your luggage? No luggage. Just a guitar underneath. Comb, toothbrush-- that's it. That's the way I do it. You check your guitar in baggage? Yeah, once in about six months. After that, get a new one. Uh, deductible, you know. Tools? [ Dick Alen ] Chuck has always caught the imagination of the kids-- not only the young black kids, but the white kids, from the beginning of his career. He's been able to keep the old ones and bring the new generation all the time. The 15-, 16-year-olds, as they come in, as they hear Chuck on the oldies stations, like it, know it's good music and just stay with it. He has always been going. The man is a natural guitar player. He's a natural businessman. He feels it's a very important part of his life and his career, and he takes care of it very well. I think my first date was $800 a week, and that was six nights, so it's about from about $100 a night... to, uh, now I'm getting blrlrl $1,000 a night, you see. [ Interviewer ] How much? Is that a secret? Oh, the I.R.S. knows. They know it straight now. Sure. No problem. Cute. [ Interviewer ] How many concerts do you do a year? Well, I'll just multiply six by 12 months. Seventy to a hundred at the most, and that's diminishing because here I'm nearing 60, right? I've had what I call extreme success... from what I contemplated in my life, and, uh, I want to enjoy a bit of it too. I want to go to some gigs, go to some rock concerts... and sit there and, "Hey, baby! Play that music, white boy!" [ Chuckling ] [ Dick Alen ] When the contract reads X, whatever it is, he'll be there doin' exactly what the contract says. People try to help him, try to guess for him, and that's how trouble starts. That's part of the contract: that the buyer has to supply a rock 'n' roll band. Uh, the only requirement is that they know Chuck Berry's greatest hits. Mr. Berry, good to meet you. [ Man ] Welcome to Columbus. Shall we go? Let's go rock 'n' roll. [ Laughing ] All right. [ Woman ] Hey, Chuck! I met Chuck Berry once when my manager said, "Gee, you're gonna open on a bill for Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry." And we thought this was "forget it," you know. I was 23 or 24, and these guys were our heroes and-- and, uh, so we're real excited, and the guy says, "He's gonna get a band that's gonna back Chuck Berry up." We said, "No, don't tell him-- Don't get one of the local bands. Tell him that we'll back him up." I had-- I think my first album might've just come out around that time. So we went down to Maryland. We drove in from some overnight gig. I forget from where. We came out and played about a half hour, which is generally the time you were allotted in those days... if you were an opening act, and we went over pretty good. We did all right. And then Jerry Lee came out, and he did his set... and, you know, ended standin' on the piano and, uh, no Chuck Berry, right? No. He's not there. So, it's about-- I forget what time it was supposed to go on, but it was gettin' very close to the time he was supposed to go on. There's no sign of him. The promoter's gettin' really nervous. He comes up to me and he says, "Look, "go on back out there, because Chuck Berry's not here. I don't think he's comin'." I said, "I'm not gonna go out there. They're waitin' for Chuck Berry." And, uh, about five minutes before the show... was timed to start, the back door opens, and he comes in. He's by himself, and, uh, he's got a guitar case. And that was it. I guess he pulled up in his own car. Didn't have anybody with him. And he walked-- kinda walked by me... and went straight to the office... with the promoter, you know? Where I guess the rumor was-- [ Laughing ] I think the rumor was he would get 11 grand, and at the end of the night he'd give a grand back if the band was okay... and if the equipment worked. I don't know if that's true, but that's what we heard. So straight into the office, and then he comes-- walks out of the office... and he comes into the band's room, you know. We said, "Well, great. We're gonna go on." I said, "Well, Chuck. Like, what-- What songs are we gonna do?" He says, "Well, we're gonna do some Chuck Berry songs." [ Laughing ] That's all he says. So we go, "Okay." We get out on stage. The crowd's goin' insane. They can see him. He walks on, opens up the guitar case, tunes the guitar. The lights are up. The place is goin' nuts. And we're goin', like, you know, "What are we gonna start with, Chuck?" And he's kinda not payin' attention to us or not hearin' us. And then all I see is-- [ Stomping Foot, Imitating Guitar ] That's it! [ Laughing ] You know? And, like, the band is like, "Yaahh!" We're in a state of total panic. We're tryin' to figure out what song are we playin'. Uh, what key is it in? Chuck plays in a lot of strange keys... like B-flat, E-flat. And our bass player, who was-- He's kind of the... historian of the band, you know? So everybody runs to him and he has the right key, right? And so, uh, we pick up the key, and we're doin' pretty good, I think. I forget what song it was. Uh, but we're playin' away, and the crowd's goin' nuts, and Chuck runs back and says, "Play for that money, boys!" We forgot to tell him we were doin' this for free. Anyway, the night ended, there was a big brawl in front of the stage, and the lights came up and I think his amp blew up. We're kind of-- I guess we're doin' "Johnny B. Goode." ♪♪ [ Imitates Guitar ] You know, we're just playin' that rhythm. And he just kinda walked to the side of the stage, packed his guitar in front of the entire auditorium. They're goin' crazy. [ Chuckles ] Then he waved, and that was it. [ Laughing ] He walked out and walked back into his car, and he was gone. I doubt that he'd remember us, you know. We were probably-- We were another one of the bands he was using on the road at the time. It was just the kind of night that-- that-- You know, when I'm 65 or 70, and I got, you know, my grandkids. "Chuck Berry? Yeah, I met Chuck Berry. [ Laughing ] Matter of fact, I backed Chuck Berry up one night." "You did?" "Yeah." You know, it's a story you're always gonna tell. [ Chuck ] This is our cornerstone we had placed in the fall of '57. At least, I wanted it to be a cornerstone. When I bought it, I found out it was a tombstone. Well, death of a cornfield and birth of an amusement park. I wanted it to be like Disneyland or Six Flags, but it turned out to be One Flag. I really wanted to have a great place for fishing. My father was a great fisherman, and all the family's are great fishermen. So when we first started improving this, this whole area here was just a valley, a big valley, and we had the lake dug out and filled up in about a year. And, uh, shortly after that, we had festivals in the '60s. We had a festiv-- One of the festivals had 40,000 people. Another one had 60,000 people, and the whole park in a sense is kind of like Hyde Park. I have never seen it, actually. We just called it Hyde Park in the suburbs of Missouri. If you wanted to go, you'd just come to Missouri. Come to Berry Park. Now, this is the barroom of the clubhouse we had built here... in, uh-- During the '50s, when I was touring... with all my colleagues and everything, I wanted everybody to come and see. I wanted everybody to come here, from Laverne Baker to Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers-- you name it. And I think that, um, I-- Actually, in here, I predicted playing here... in my rockin'-chair years. And, um, here's where I could settle down and do my thing. We didn't get off the ground with this, 'cause I was touring so fast.

What happens there? Who needs an ending? I wanted to serve Chuck up with a good band, 'cause I never heard him play in tune, you know. And I was-- I've been so disappointed with Chuck Berry's live gigs for years and years... whenever I've seen him, 'cause he didn't give a damn. You know? And he just-- If he made a mistake, he'd blame it on the band. I mean, and he'd just wing it and get through, and he's got such a powerful personality... that he's managed to get away with it. I know everybody said that I was, you know, mad to take the gig on, and no doubt they said it to you too. But, um, so I ordered the straitjacket, allowed six to eight weeks for delivery... and, uh, if anybody was gonna do it, I wanted it to be me. I'm not so much a musical director, you know, as an S-and-M Director. It's, uh-- [ Chuckles ] Social and Musical Director's the polite way-- It's the S-and-M Band, you know. [ Interviewer ] What was it, when you first heard Chuck Berry, that made you... change your life? There's something about the sound. Uh, the total-- I don't even know if Chuck realizes what he did. I don't think maybe he does. I mean, people sometimes don't, you know. I mean, Michelangelo probably thought he was third-rate too. But, um, it was just such a total thing: the great sound, the great rhythm. But on top of all that, such a great total overall sound... came off the needle on that record. You know, all of them. The first one, I think, was "Johnny B. Goode." Uh-- That-- That's when I knew what I really wanted to do. You know? I didn't have to make a living. I didn't dream I could make a living, but I knew that's what I wanted to do. I would do it as a hobby even if I was an accountant now or something, you know. Probably be better off. [ Chuckling ] Leave the amp as I set it. That's my amp, and I'm setting it the way I wish. [ Man ] Well-- -I'm not speakin' to you. [ Man ] I'm answering your question. That's gonna have the sound on the film, baby. I'm interested in how it sounds here. It sounds the way I wish it to sound. That's the way it's going to sound if I am playing. If I am not playing-- [ Man ] Turn it any way you want. Check the tape out, Chuck. Why it was being done? Well, don't touch my amp. You said it won't be done. He said he didn't. -He said why it's being done. -Why it's being done is because it's not recording well. Okay. That's what's gonna end up on film. -Huh? -That's the way it's gonna end up on film. If it winds up on the film, that's the way Chuck Berry plays it. Ya understand? I understand about it. I understand. -I was talking to anybody. -You gotta live with it afterwards. I been living for sixty years with it! I know that! Okay, then realize it! Is it gonna be around after you're dead and gone? It ain't you and me. It's everybody. Oh, well, I ain't dyin'. Go on, then, and sing your song. Shit. [ Keith ] I think he's got a little worm in him. He's the only guy that's hit me that I never got back. You know? Maybe I'm savin' it. [ Laughs ] But, um-- [ Interviewer ] Tell me about that. Oh, it was in a dressing room like this. He'd done a show in New York, and I went up to say hello, and he was just leaving... with a little bit of white tail. And, uh, I made the mistake of tapping him on the shoulder, saying, "Hey, Chuck, don't rush off without saying hello." Because I'd known him. I met him in '65, first time. Yeah, and, uh, he just turned around and just gave me a full shot right in the face. You know, boom. I was very proud that I didn't go down. I don't know. Maybe he got his fingers burnt earlier on... and decided to shut the rest of the world out. I think since he got out of jail, he came out with a chip on his shoulder and, uh, I just tried to knock it off. I don't know whether I did or not, but, uh, I respect the man. Always will, you know, for what he's done and also for myself. I've lived under the umbrella of the Rolling Stones for 20-odd years. In a way, I'm in as totally insulated a scene as maybe Chuck's. This must be one of the most difficult gigs. If I can handle this, I ain't worried about nothin' else.

This is devil music. And Elvis, he asked me-- He says, "Do you think I'm playin' the devil's music?" [ Laughing ] "The hell. You are the devil, boy." We couldn't get records played on the radio, and I remember hearing Phil Chess and Leonard saying, discussing this, "You know what? If we could get a white kid to play this song, we could get it played." Because the radio stations were owned by all caucasians. They wouldn't play black music. So they said, "Okay." So all of a sudden you got Carl Perkins popped up, Elvis Presley, uh, Gene Vincent. They all come out of, what, Sun Records in, uh, Nashville somewhere. Payola made it. That's what made it for Sun Records. Geoff Philips and myself, I'll have to admit, cranked payola off, started paying off disc jockeys... to play records. I said, "Mr. Philips, you shouldn't do that. That's a sin." [ Chuckling ] He said, "It'll pay off, son." So he went to jail. [ Chuckling ] [ Interviewer ] But those records were great records. You still had to pay to have them played? Well, yeah, but everybody wants the money. Everybody wants to be paid to be appreciated, not just to draw $80 a week for playin' a record. A star, whoever he is, makes $100,000 dollars off a record, and he gets $80 a week. There was a bad omen hangin' there... when the thing became separated. It became separated. R-and-B became-- became what we was doin'... and rock 'n' roll became what the white kids was doin'. I think you mean we moved in separated. We weren't called popular music. We were not put in that class. We were called rhythm and blues. [ Bo ] Yeah. When I started with a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop a-lop bam boom... and Pat Boone covered it, uh, uh, uh-- I was wop-bop-a-la all over the place. A-and so I remember Art Rube says-- Arthur Goldsberg, he says-- He would put my record on the top station, and then here come Pat Boone. The-- The white kids wanted mine, 'cause it was real rough and... raw, and Pat Boone had this smooth version: [ Softly ] ♪ Wop-bop-a-loo-bop a-lop bam boom ♪♪ And I'd say, "Wop-bop-a-loo--" I had a gut to mine. So the white kids would take mine and put it in a drawer and put his on the dresser. -For their parents to see. -I was in the same house. But I was mad when Pat Boone cut my record. I wanted to get him. I said, "I'm goin' to Nashville to find him." I wanted to get him because, to me, he was stopping my progress. I wanted to be famous, and here this man came and took my song! [ Chuck ] White man. A-And took-- Not only did he take "Tutti Frutti," but he gonna take "Long Tall Sally," and he didn't know how to duck back in no alley! Son of a gun! I said, "I got to do somethin' about it." Later, I thought about that and said, "That was good," but back then I said, "I can't stand him." But as I got older, I got bolder. [ Chuck ] Yeah! And now I've started rubbin' shoulders. Yes. [ Keith ] Johnnie Johnson, Chuck's piano player, right? Chuck hadn't worked with him for 20-odd years. Those two have a strange rela-- He walked in on Johnnie's band... in a little club in East St. Louis one day and took it over, you know, and Johnnie, being the guy he is, "Pleasure. Right, brother." I don't think Johnnie has realized really... that Chuck-- I said to Johnnie, "Play a boogie." You know? I mean, he'll go flow naturally into it. ♪♪ [ Singing Boogie ] And he's not doin' a Chuck Berry song. I know, the way he's playing, it's his riff. Chuck adapted it guitar. I know that, too, because of the key it's in. It's in piano. It's in Johnnie's keys. It's in piano keys. If it was a guitar-- I mean, this is guitar, rock 'n' roll. You play in A and E and D... 'cause you got open strings and there-- This is a little technical, but... for a guit-- That-- If it's a guitar band, you play in those keys, because it's-- they're guitar keys, you know? On top of everything else, we're playing in piano keys: you know, horn keys, jazz keys, Johnnie Johnson's keys. You know? And I-- I mean, the minute that he does "School Days," ♪♪ [ Singing ] he ain't copyin' Chuck's riffs on piano. Chuck adapted them to guitar... and put those great lyrics behind them. But without somebody to give him them riffs, voila,no song, just a lot of words on paper. I didn't write the music with him. I'd be in the room sometime while he was writing. That's it. He would write the lyrics, then he and I would get together... and we played some kind of music that he could put lyrics into, and it would all come out just right, you know. Some would be fast; some would be slow... like this piece, uh, uh, "Havana Moon," for instance. That was a slow sort of calypso thing. So we had to find some calypso music to go with the lyrics... to what he was-- to his "Havana Moon." And then, uh, pieces like "Baby Doll"... and, uh, "Roll Over, Beethoven" -- all these were fast, so we had to come up with fast music... that would blend in with the words that he was writin', so he could get all his sentence out and still come out on time. So this is the way he did it. They say, "That's a Chuck Berry song because there's--" ♪♪ [ Singing ] Well, the first time I heard that... was in Carl Hogan's-- in one of Carl Hogan's riffs in, uh, Louis Jordan's band. We have, uh, T-Bone Walker. Uh, I love T-Bone Walker's slurs and his blues. So put a little Carl Hogan and a little T-Bone Walker... and a little Charlie Christian, the guitarist, and-- and, uh, Tommy Dorsey's band together, look what a span of people that you will please. And that's what I did in "Johnny B. Goode," uh, "Roll Over, Beethoven." And making it simple is another important factor, I think, that resulted in, uh, a lot of, uh, the artists... understanding and being able to play my music-- if you can call it my music, but there's nothing new under the sun. ♪ When, when ♪ Okay, let's just... a cappella.

[ Interviewer ] But there's not an understanding on his part that he's a great songwriter. He just kind of sloughs it off. Not entirely. I'm not too sure. I've only just met him, and it's hard to say... from just knowing him this short a time... really what his kind of acceptance of the whole thing is. First, I'd heard stories that he was very bitter... and he thought people had ripped him off. In order to think that, you must be aware of how far your influence has spread. I don't really know if he's completely aware of how much people love his music, because I know he's more-- he's often very keen to be a showman. And that can be a sign of the fact that you're not very secure with what you are good at. I like to hear him play those ballads and things like that. I know that's deep in his heart.

One thing about him: The things he's write about, he have studied about or know about. Because, like, "Beethoven" and all these other songs that he made, you can tell he been to school with 'em. You tell 'em about how you went to school, darling, and your education you got, you know, how you went-- Oh, Lord, I lost all of it. No, you didn't. No, he hasn't lost anything. Mom came out of college-- Where? In Oklahoma? Yes, uh-huh. Mom came out of college as a teacher. And Dad came off the farm. Yes, and plus he was blind 'til he was 12. Well, partially. And they pierced his ears, and it all came back. So Daddy, when he married Mother-- By the way, she calls him "Henry," you know. And one more thing, she's six months older than him and never lets him forget it. "I'm older than you, Henry. Listen to me." Anyway, Daddy couldn't take it. Daddy went back to school during-- after they got married. I'm nine years old, Daddy's goin' to school. He says, "We used to go to school." He was going to school trying to catch Mama. That's true. Mama layin' back with her education, "He'll never catch me." Boy, does this box office bring back a memory, a real particular memory. When I was 11 years old, I came up to this very box office... to get a ticket to see to get a ticket to see Tale of Two Cities. My father wanted us to see it because it had a lot of artistic qualities about it. The lady said, "Come on, we're not selling you a ticket. You know you people can't come in here. Go away." You know, it took two years for that to come to our theater in our neighborhood. Things have changed, really changed. It made me think that someday... I would come back. I'll be back. This theater was the Great White Way of St. Louis, the epitome of theatrical business in St. Louis. And the Father of Rock 'N' Roll, a cog in that big wheel... is starring here tonight. Me. It's a far cry from years back... when my forefathers, a few blocks away, were sold on the civil courthouse steps. Sold. Now, that's a big change. [ Audience Cheering ] [ Cheering Loudly ] Thank you.

It could be a corner bar. It's what it represents: elegance, decency, the, er, strive for a better manner of life. In the theater where I saw A Tale of Two Cities, we didn't have such elegance. I don't mean the decor; I mean the clientele. There was hollering from the balcony. When a scene came on, you expressed your feelings. Here you get a-- and that's enough. Lemme hear you holler ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! [ Chuck ] But whatever it be, according to my music, I'll generate the feeling that we had back in our neighborhood.

Ah, there were others, but not with that much rhythm and that much-- The way the lyrics rolled off the tongue, the way they stabbed, the way they cut... and the way they sort of seemed to lay there with the drums, all the lyric. It's just, a-- a free-form expression. And he did the same thing with the guitar that he did with his voice and his writing. You couldn't find an earlier example of a singer/songwriter/guitarist. Before 1956 or '7, in-- a singer sung songs, and a songwriter wrote them, and the twain never did meet. And if there was a great song, 15 people did versions of it. You had your so-called standards because that was the way it is. Some guy wrote the song, and if it was a great song, everybody recorded it. But he put it back; he did the troubadour. And he can play 'em, and he's the only one who can play 'em like that.

And when I scooted out from under the table, the big round table we have, Mother says, "Do that again." Mm-hmm. And every time company came, I had to do that for Mother, and they'd laugh and laugh. It's just the entertainment, I guess, in my blood. Never came into my mind again... until I got to the Paramount Theater in Brooklyn. In the middle of "Mabellene," had nothing to do but play a riff, and just thought I'd go down on my knees and play the riff and scoot along.

It just came out. ♪ Go, Johnny Go, go, go ♪♪ [ Lennon ] I don't think there's any group in the world, white or black-- but mainly the white kids were really turned on by Chuck Berry. Not one of us, the Beatles, the Stones-- you name any top group, they've all been influenced by him. His lyrics were very intelligent lyrics. In the '50s, when people were just singin' virtually about nothin', he was writin' social comment songs. He was writin' all kinds of songs with incredible meter to the lyrics, which influenced Dylan and me and many other people. The meter was tremendous. He's the greatest rock 'n' roll poet, and I really admire him. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

What do you think was distinctive about Chuck's-- Talent. God-given talent. Charisma. He has a certain-- Chuck Berry is the greatest-- He's the Hank Williams of rock 'n' roll. Chuck was aware of what the Grand Ole Opry was. We talked about that when we first met. He listened to the Grand Ole Opry in St. Louis. My first impression of Chuck was that, uh, he was a black country singer, sort of. It was rhythm and blues, but it wasn't so rhythm and blues at the time. Uh, sort of with a country flavor. That may sound very strange, but it was-- I still feel that way. I still feel very strongly that... Chuck might have been a mixture of... first rock 'n' roll, rhythm and blues and then some country.

Tied around, and tellin' him that he's gonna get run out of the neighborhood... because he defied the system. The community tradition. He defied them, and then our good friend, Dick Clark, came up with the television thing and started to puttin' us thing and started to puttin' us American Bandstand. We had something to sing, but we couldn't dance. No, you couldn't dance. We couldn't participate in the audience. Because if you're in the audience, he'd let you out. The station was owned by people, I think, that prohibited him to go that far with us. Why was it done? Answer that for the record. Why was it done if he didn't want it to be done? He was the master of ceremonies. I say this: It was still a little Jewish boy... that got it over the country with Alan Freed. Amen. Amen. He still got it over the country. And he did a good job. I love you, Alan! Alan! -You're darned right. -It wasn't anything we were doing so wrongly. It was just that people was so slow... You were black! To accept change. You was black! Tell him again. Will you tell him, man, again? You was black, and they didn't want that black image over their kids. You was a hero. The kids was lookin' up to you. They didn't want their kids lookin' up-- - What kids? What kids? They didn't want the white kids lookin' up at this big ol' greasy black guy, uh, uh, out of Georgia, out of Mississippi or out of Chicago. They want their kids to see a smooth white boy looking pretty and all dudey. And lookin' "rootie." You know? And so here's a black out there singing' and screamin' and beamin' and steamin'. They said, no, no, no! And now, ladies and gentlemen, here's the young fella-- As a matter of fact, he's right at the age I was when I started out. A beautiful, mellow, ripe 29-ish, you know.

Robert Cray, ladies and gentlemen! Fran, how long have you been working with Chuck? Now I've been with him just a little over 30 years. 30 years? Just a little over 30 years. Not very long. I started to say 'til Tuesday. 30 years and three weeks. I've been here since Tuesday. How'd it start? Casual Introduction. That's all. He needed a secretary and I needed a different change. I was looking for change. You came to hear the music at a rock and roll show. Yes, so we went and saw Chuck Berry, and I left the next day. I was 21, and I was here a year, and we had already established our offices, a nightclub. We were owning and operating two corporations. That was a terrible load on a 21-year-old. They didn't know what I was either. They didn't know if I was white or black. A lot of 'em thought you were my wife. Yes, a lot of 'em thought I was his wife. They still do. They don't know, and they wouldn't ask. They were too polite. I have been married since October the 28th-- It's hard for a man to remember these things. October 28, 1950-- 1948... until, I guess, it'd be about 2000... before I even think of separating. But for all rock and roll stars who go on the road, they've got 40 million girls out there screaming and yelling for them. Is that hard? Is what hard? Well, I'll tell you this. No, it's not hard if you have a conviction at your home. If you keep the home fires burning, you do what you wanna do. And as I always said, use discretion. Be sensible about it. Keep the home fires burning. My name is Themetta Silks Berry, and I have been married to Charles Berry for 38 years. We have had a wonderful marriage. We love each other as much as we did the day we met. You'd been married about five years before-- [ Chuck ] Baby, that's enough. [ Man ] I remember him growing up as a young man with a mechanical mind. He stayed busy all the time. And I would say he would be, in effect, a very unique person. I'm a beautician by trade, and Charles was interested in that type of thing, and it influenced him. He went to the same school I did and graduated and everything, and he started doing some of the heads on tours when he would go on tours. So he had a lot of fun doing that, and I had a lot of fun asking him about it. And he would try to do his hair and I would see little flaws that he would make. I guess the thing I remember most about Chuck was... he was a deep thinker and he loved to hear and play the blues. [ Lucy ] Chuck was a very loving brother. He used to go to bed at 9:00 every night, and every day, my mother fed him Bulgarian buttermilk. That's the reason why he's got so much energy today. ♪♪ ♪ Run into a throw Hard workin' at the mill ♪ ♪ Never fail in the mail Boy, you get a rotten bill ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business for me to be involved in ♪ ♪ Salesman talkin' to me tryin' to run me up a creek ♪ ♪ Say you can buy it Go on, try it You can pay me next week ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business for me to be involved in ♪ ♪ Blonde haired, good-lookin' Tryin' to get him hooked ♪ ♪ Want him to marry get a home and settle down and write a book ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business for me to be involved in ♪ Go, Keith, go, go, go! ♪♪ [ Instrumental ] ♪ Same thing every day gettin' up and goin' to school ♪ ♪ No need of you complainin' Your objection's overruled Yeah ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business for me to be involved in ♪ ♪ Pay phone, something wrong dime's gone ♪ ♪ We'll mail I oughta sue the operator She's tellin' me a tale ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business for me to be involved in ♪ ♪ A friend of Yokohama been fightin' in the war ♪ ♪ Army bunk, army shower army clothes, army car ♪ ♪ Too much-- whoa ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business for me to be involved in ♪ ♪ Workin' in the fillin' station Too many tabs ♪ ♪ Wipe the windows check the tires check the oil, no gas ♪ Hah! ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business ♪ ♪ Too much monkey business for me to be involved in ♪♪ Chuck has had a couple of run-ins with the law and had problems.

And those that have loved, and are out of love... remember love so I write about love.

But you cannot-- I cannot dislike the guy, even so. He gives me more headaches than Mick Jagger, but I still can't dislike him. I can't. I mean, I love him, and I love his family. I've done what I wanted to do for him. He's a good man, cool. Now I'm gonna sleep for a month. Chuck Berry, when he's remembered, what do you want people to say? I'll tell you what. I could say-- I won't know. It is out of my department after I'm gone. But whatever it be, I just hope it's real and it's a fact which will be the truth. That's it. I hope they'll just speak the truth. Be it pro, con, bad, good. I was going to say black and white, but it wouldn't be right. [ Keith ] He decided to write a book, make a movie, and he opened the door and he thought he could just let a few people in, and goddamn it, the whole world came in. He thought he could control how many came in, but suddenly the outside world flooded in, and that's maybe what's so intriguing about him. The more you find out about him, the less you know about him.
