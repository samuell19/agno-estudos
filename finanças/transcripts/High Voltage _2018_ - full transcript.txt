I brought my axe, Rachel brought her golden voice, and Scott brought the tunes. And there was sex, and drugs, and murder, and mayhem, and a bunch of other shit you won't believe. I wouldn't. (lightning crashing) It all started one dark and stormy night. I was celebrating my 50th birthday for the third time. Who the hell are you people? And what the hell are you listening to? I let my daughter Chloe sponsor the party with some vodka company, just to make a few bucks. She was a hustler, a real ball-buster like her old man. So of course, she put on the one song I hate. You've heard this one, haven't you? Every few years it ends up in a beer commercial, number one on the charts, my one hit, my meal ticket. I peaked at 20, and I've been circling the bowl of this business ever since. (rock music) [Guests] Aw... Yeah yeah, I'll be happy if I never had to hear that fucking song again. Oh, but it's your birthday, Pops. Sorry, sorry. (guests grumble) Are you sure this is the right house? [Zach] Dude, I don't know. All these houses in the hills looked the same, so let's just assume it is. Pardon me. Dude! - [Zach] What's up? - This fucking house is sick. Look at that shit. Are you shootin'? Wanna leave your guitar in the car, man? Fuck, you know what? [Zach] You start playing Kumbaya for the chicks. [Scott] Go fuck yourself, okay? (laughs) Stop. [Woman] Party over here! (guests whooping) [Scott] Thank you, sweetie. [Jimmy] Did fate bring them to me or was it random? Who knows? [Scott] What's that? [Zach] Turn, turn around, turn around. Fuckin' Dirt Pipe, (mumbles) [Scott] Holy shit! Yeah, by Jimmy Kleen. [Zach] Jimmy Kleen, yeah, yeah. He had that hit in the '80s? Come on. [Jimmy] I tell you this much, opportunity walked right up to me, and I almost punched his lights out. Story of my life. [Scott] Check out those guitars, dude, that's sick. Hey, no cameras! Who the fuck are you guys? You brought your own guitar? Come here. Come over here. You here to play me your demo? [Scott] No. Then why the fuck are you at my house, at my party? I followed a girl here. That's how I got here, too. (laughs) Here, come on, take a seat. You like that, huh? The Rickenbacker 12-string. It's the hollow body. Harrison had one. [Jimmy] Man knows his scripture. (melancholy music) Can I play it? Can I fuck your sister? Play yours. Come on, destiny awaits. (storm rumbles) (guitar strumming) Who is that? I was going to ask you. I have no idea. Friend of yours? That's the girl. You're not going over there, are you? It's beautiful. (melodious guitar strumming) (humming) (vocalizing) (humming) (vocalizing) (guests cheering and clapping) Hey, where are you going? I can't. Come on, you just did. I'm Jimmy. What's your name? I'm Rachel. Hey, come here. This is... (clears throat) I'm Scott. You sounded great. You, too. Thanks. Let her have a seat, Caveman. Sorry, sorry. [Jimmy] Hey, let me ask you something. You guys ever been in a band? (lively guitar music) I had to get us playing fast to see if she had the goods. I could tell she was skittish, but she likes Scott, so I figured I could control her through him. (lively music) [Scott] Male, female, yeah? Excuse me. Come over here. Excuse me. Stand here. No, I don't, I don't wanna be the center of attention, I just, you know, want to be in the band. You're over here. You're over here. So what's a band? It's a statement, an ethos, where everything means something. Nirvana just didn't happen to dress like roadies. That was a decision. The Beatles bowed after every song, that was a choice. You know, it's all calculated. It's all created. It's all about the concept. And our concept centers around you. You're in charge, you're the front man. No, no, no, no, no. I'm the band leader. The front man stands in the front, you engage the audience. I'm the band leader. I'm with the band, keep the train on schedule. Our concept was never just her. [Rachel] Yeah. - [Scott] It's us. - We are a band, we are one. But it's not Hollow Bodies, it's Hollow Body. Trust me. You're the star. We want every girl to want to be her and all the guys want to fuck her. We want every girl to want to fuck you. All right, fine. Well, band leader... Yeah. What do you want to start with? Let's start with Perfect Day, seems fitting. All right. One, two... That's my part. One, two, three, four. (guitar strumming) Scott was easy to figure out. I was him, once. Trying to balance the work with the wife. Something's gotta give. [Carrie] What's her name, this girl? Rachel. How old is she? I don't know. What, you were there all night and you don't know how old she is? What am I, on trial now, Carrie? I mean... Okay. It's just, it's just strange. You trust me. I trust you. I would never... never do anything to mess this up. (gentle music) (baby coos) ♪ What can I say ♪ [Scott] See? ♪ I love you in every way ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ (chuckles) [Carrie] It's good. ♪ It's just a perfect day. ♪ Thanks. [Jimmy] And then there was Rachel and Barb. I hadn't counted on Barb. Stage mom. Barb's been pimping Rachel out for a long a time now. She's a grown-up version of the kind of groupie you'd see. Do anything or anyone to get on the bus. Shouldn't you not be drinking with your medicine? Don't you worry about me. I'm going to outlive all of you. How old did he say he was? Who? That Scott. I don't know. Well, is he 40? He's 33. Isn't that old to be still doing this, don't you think? Jimmy's 50 something. Well, he has a name. He has connections. What has Scott got? Talent. What do you know about him? He's married. He's got a baby. A husband and a father. How's he supporting his family while he's doing this? Why do you care? Sweetheart, I'm just making sure you're protected. Special. These entertainment people, you know what they can be like. (mysterious music) [Jimmy] I had my own problems. I'm underwater in this stupid house and I have to go beg from Richie Rolands. Richie runs a multinational media empire that he inherited from his dad, who I once made a ton of cash for. Now I got to go kiss Junior's ring. So who's fucking her? You? This guy? Is she a tomcat in sack? What's the deal? Talk to me. A tomcat's a male cat. Just listen to the track. Just send me the link. You want me to listen to it on your bullshit phone speakers? Come on, man. Well, come up to the studio. I got to go in a minute. (sighs) Listen, I'm not her dad. If she wants to fuck you, she can fuck you. That's why you're not fucking her, right? Because you're like her dad or something? Hell, man, you look like shit. How are you living like this? I mean, what's going on? (sighs) Yeah, I don't know. I'm getting fat and my house is falling apart. Everything just went to shit after this bitch left me. How did Chloe take it? Oh, that's not Chloe's mom, that was the one before. You know, but Chloe threw a party, she burned her furs in effigy. Chip off the old block, huh? Well, I'll give you this, she's got a look. She's got it all. So what? I mean, how many YouTube subs does she have? What kind of metrics are we talking about? Come on, man, that's the way things are going these days, you got to keep up. Now, don't give me that. She is gold and I can spot gold. Come on, Richie. You know... the last time you called me Richie, I was an unpaid intern and you were too fucking high to remember my name. So try to remember now, now it's Rick. Sorry, Rick. You're just not that memorable. She is. Well, see, the thing is, and you don't seem to be getting this, is I don't really do A & R anymore, okay? I'm launching a music streaming platform, I'm not trying to sign your little band. And just a bit of advice, you should move on. You're fucking 50, all right? Have you looked in a mirror lately? You can't be out there shaking your ass. That's why I need this to work. Why did you even come over here anyway, then? I came over here out of respect for our friendship, because we go way back. And my physical therapist is right around the corner, he's actually Geffen's guy. All right, look. I know a guy, he's always looking for opening acts. Maybe that can get you a West Coast tour or something, how does that sound? Yeah, we can do that. No frills. I don't care about accommodations. All I care about are advances. Fifty grand or something. Oh, an advance? You want an advance? What is this, 1989? Get 500,000 Instagram followers and then talk to me about an advance. Ten grand, anything? I love you, man. I really do, I get a kick out of you. I'm gonna... I'm gonna text you the guy's info. And I'm going to send my maids over. (sighs) Thanks, Richie. Rick. It's time to start playing out. You hear me? - Already? - Yeah. Don't you think it's too soon? I mean, yeah, are you sure we're ready? It's our only way to spread the word. It's the only way to really get good. All right. Yeah, when we play out, there's no safety net. We don't have guitar techs, so you have to tune, change your strings, hook up the PA, you got to be good, you got to be fast. All right? And you have to command the stage. They're there to see a performance. Something they'll remember. (dark mysterious music) (dogs barking) ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ All right, let's do it again. Can I help you? Oh, the door was open. And I'm here for Rachel. Oh, you must be her mom. Barb. I'm Jimmy. Well, you're in pretty good shape for an older guy. (chuckles) Older than what? I'm probably the oldest woman that's ever been in this house. I wouldn't say that exactly. (laughs) You raised quite a talented daughter. Yes, I did. (chuckles) You look kind of beat up in this one. That was a long time ago. And yet, there it is on the wall like you miss it. More of a cautionary tale. We all carry the seeds of our own destruction, Mr. Klein. (sighs) You're telling me. Mom? What are you doing here? Oh, honey, I thought we could have lunch. Hi, I'm Scott. You're the writer. I can see why she likes you. (clears throat) Well, I mean, actually we kind of all write the songs. Some of them are quite good. Thanks. But where is this all going? Well, I wasn't going to mention this but since you're here, there is label interest and a few touring dates. A tour? Just West Coast dates. So, is this part of a record deal? No, there's nothing concrete, there's no advance. It's just for some exposure. Twelve dates, fourteen days. Hmm. Look, I'm just not sure about all this. Come on, haven't you ever road-tripped before? Every summer. Perfect. We have to talk about this, Rachel. Let's go, say goodbye to your friends. [Jimmy] Ah, Barb, playing hard to get. (laughs) We hit the road two weeks after that, one last run. Getting out there again, I got excited. I thought maybe my luck had changed. It did. It got worse. (aggressive rock music) How are you doing? All right listen, this is the perfect crowd. They're just drunk enough. Good training wheels. (sighs) Just seems like a lot of people. I once played to 40,000 people on three hits of acid. You know, you're just... Yeah, that's what they told me. I don't remember shit but if I can do that, you can do this. Look at that guy, do you even care what he thinks? It's just like rehearsal, all right? Okay. Do you trust me? No. (chuckles) Well, good. That's 'cause you're smart. Look, here, it's going to get hot under the lights. You're going to have to take this off. Jimmy. Thanks. Yeah. You look beautiful. Thanks. See, I told you, Missy. Okay. You're on. All right, let's go, guys. (mic feedback whining) Hey, we're Hollow Body. We're from Los Angeles. [Jimmy] Perfect Day. One, two, three, four. (guitars strumming) (mic feedback whistling) (mysterious music) (heart beats accelerating) (lightning crashing) Are you okay? Do you guys think I like the road? Carrying my own gear? Bad food and truck stop shits? No, but that's the road. You do your fucking job and you get on with it. Dude, she had a bad night. Yeah, but you better get your shit together, honey, because Mommy is not here to fucking help you anymore. She gets it, just give her time. Oh, time? Let me tell you about time. You're 33 years old with a wife and a kid. She's 23 years old. She got five or six more fuck-ups in her life. You have no Plan B. And this is Plan A. (sighs) Fucking bullshit. I'm sorry, I'm sorry... All right, hey, hey, don't listen to that fucking dickhead. Bullshit. Put that fucking camera down before I'll stick it up your fucking ass. Think he's fucking Scorcese. (engine choking) Goddamn it! (sighs) (mumbles) shit! (coughs and spits) (sighs) What the hell is the problem now? It's the battery. Neil said it was touchy. It's not fucking working. Nice. This is a fucking embarrassment in there. I had to pull favors for that gig. It makes me look bad. Next time, she'll be ready. Next time? There isn't going to be a next time. If she can't tour, it's fucking done. I'll sing lead for a couple of shows. It's not a big deal! Do you think the frat boys came out to see you? Listen, you're just along for the ride. You are a decent songwriter, an okay singer, and quite frankly, a shitty guitarist. You know what? You know what I'm good at? - What? Getting her to put up with your bullshit. You're just a fucking has-been who hasn't written a goddamn good song in 20 fucking years. Well, bite me! (angry yelling) Finally we get some focus back! Fuck you, you fucking piece of shit! Fuck you. (laughs) I like to see you get mad, finally. Fuck off! Zach! Your mommy's here. Okay, this? All this... is over. This is all too much for her. So sweetheart, let's just go home. Get in the car. Now. (sighs) [Scott] Rachel. Are you all right? (engine revs) (dark droning music) (lightning crashes) [Scott] Jesus Fuck! Rachel, Rachel, Rachel! (siren wailing) (camera shutter whirrs) (somber music) (screams) [Jimmy] I understand second chances. I've almost died a few times. Overdose here, overdose there, stabbed in prison even. There's no white light. But Rachel's not like me. She's fragile. This could have broke her. (gentle melancholy music) (slow heartbeat thudding) Well, maybe Barb dying would finally set Rachel free. (sobs and laughs) Man, was I wrong about that. So you think after that she'd take it easy. Wrong. She went crazy. (thunder crashing) And of course Chloe was there to enable all her bad behavior. Here. [Jimmy] I get it. Cheat death, you don't cash out, you double down. Wow. You never did that before. There's a lot of things I've never done before, huh? (chuckles) Yes, uhuh, proof of concept, yes. I'm going to try every single one of them. (chuckles) Good, you ready to go on? No, that part still scares me. You've got this. You just need to, like, loosen up a little bit, and don't get too drunk. I kind of like getting drunk. (laughs) Do you wanna... try something? Like what? Like him? You want me to... Yes. Go, kiss a stranger. Just make out with somebody. Work off some of this... nervous energy. (laughing) I've got to go. Hey, don't take too long. You're on soon. Yeah. If you don't, I will. Oh, my God. (dark mysterious music) Hi. Hi. Sorry, um... (electric zaps) Oh. Hey, you okay? You okay? You all right? (dark mysterious music) (electric zapping) (strumming) Dude, this thing is amazing. (distant scream) - Yeah, just don't mess it up. [Chloe] Stacey is not allowed at this event. - I'll be gentle. - I don't like her, make her leave. Thanks for setting this up, baby. Oh, please, I'm doing this for Rachel. Not you, old man. This is what you have to look forward to when you get older. No, he looks like he's probably a good dad. As long as he doesn't keep hanging out with you. Mm-hmm. (chuckles) That's my girl. (dark ominous music) (heavy breathing) (electric crackling) (breaths shuddering) (breaths heavily) (moans pleasurably) (electric crackling) [Jimmy] Rachel, we're on. (dark ominous music) Coming.

(crowd cheers) What's this? Thought we could try something new. (laughs) Okay. Right, fellas. How's everybody feeling out there? Right, she wants to try something new here. Something new?

[Jimmy] Now that I knew she could deliver, I had to get Rick on board. He'd been avoiding me after our last fuck up, but I knew the bartender at his favorite restaurant. (car horn honks) Ricky! Oh, you got to be kidding me. You don't write, you don't call? We got nothing to talk about, okay? I gave you a shot, right? You blew it. No, look at this, look at this. Struck by a lightning.

Oh, hey, hey, hey, Jimmy, nice to meet you. Have we met before? No. - No? - [Rick] What do you need? Why are you doing this to me? - Vegas or something? No, why are you doing this to me? (chuckles) Just give it a listen, please. Why? Come on, we got a bunch of new songs. There's a clip from her performance. [Rick] Why? She's possessed, it's crazy. I'm telling you. (sighs) You want me to get on my knees or something? Yeah, I do. I've been on my knees since I got into this business. Come on, just give it a listen. All right. I'll do that. Thank you. You're welcome. Take it easy, man. Stop doing this, okay? You're all frantic. All right. [Rick] You seem crazy. Thanks, Rick. Tracey, pleasure. Oh. (phone rings) (baby grizzles) Okay. Hey, what you doing? Daddy duty. Yeah, me too. (laughs) (chuckles) Oh, I remember when Chloe was that young, that little soft spot on her head. You ever think you'd have a 20-year-old? I never thought I'd live to be 20. So, I know you're all cozy there and everything, but... we need you over here. Right now? Yeah, uh, Rachel's coming over. I need to redo the guitar parts, we need harmonies. So, get your ass over here. Jimmy, dude, it's late. Yeah, you know what, I get it. It's cool. I'll just call my buddy, Owen, up. He's an amazing guitar player. He could probably sing some harmonies, too. (sighs) Okay, all right. That's my boy. See you soon. Take her? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. It's all right. (Scott sighs) Baby, you seen my keys? Yeah, here. Where are you going? Jimmy's. You didn't say this... was an every night thing. It's not. I miss you. After a long day of taking care of her, I need someone to take care of me, too. I miss us. I mean, you're either sleeping or you're with her. She'll sleep through the night soon. Carrie... We haven't had sex in months. Is that why you stay over there until 4:00 a.m.? No. Jimmy likes to work late. Jimmy, and? Rachel. And you're with her and some pervy old guy. Pervy? Carrie, come on. I looked him up. Okay, so he's someone you can look up. Maybe that's all you need to know. Okay. I'm sorry. Look, it's just... This is a once in a lifetime thing for me. This, this right here... is a once in a lifetime thing. (baby grizzles) (melancholy music) (Scott sighs) [TV Weatherman] Is about to pound this area with some gusty winds, torrential rain, and a lot of lightning, unfortunately. And of course, people who are outside.. (guitar music) [Jimmy Voicover] I could've stopped it, but I didn't. She made him better. When she changed, we all changed. (rock music) She was a force of nature. Hell, she even started booking gigs. She got us a wedding that paid 10 grand for one night. I'm not too proud. (dark synthesizer music) (electric crackling) (man screaming) What's gotten into her? Girl's got the devil in her. [Zach] And a liter of vodka. It's like she's a completely different person. She'll say something, and then you'll remind her about it the next day and then she won't even remember it. I know what you're talking about. I've seen that. She blacks out. Listen, she's an artist. She hears voices. You're a songwriter. You know what that's like. That lightning did something to her, I'm telling you. Can't have rock and roll without electricity. We're all electricity when you think about it. Every thought we have, synapsis, pew-pew-pew! She needs help. Listen, those voices in her head are our ticket to ride. Bitch better have my money! (chuckles) (door slams) Rachel, you all right? Jesus Christ. Here you go, daddy. Cash money. (chuckles) Yeah, I think the bride's dad was in the Armenian mafia or something. We haven't even talked about the fact that... a guy died in the parking lot tonight. I don't remember any of that. You don't remember an ambulance and a dead guy? He was like, they said 27, heart attack, right? Did you say heart attack? [Jimmy Voiceover] Heart attack? Yeah, right. Later we found out the LAPD didn't know what to call it. They had no idea what they were dealing with. Neither did we. Well, I heard at the Animal Benefit that this guy, well, he also died of a heart attack. She's breaking hearts already. (chuckles) I'm tired. Yeah. You should be, that was a hell of a show. You just need to calm down a little. No, I need to speed up and catch up on all the stuff that I missed out on. No, you need to relax. Okay. Help me. I can't. I need you to. (dark synthesized droning) Jesus. Rachel... What, are you my mother? Between your judging and your pushing me all the time, it's like she never left. Don't you think you've had enough? Fuck you, Jimmy. I mean, who are you to be lecturing anybody about anything? (snorts) (breathing deeply) I mean, after all, Jimmy, you're just a one-hit wonder, a two-time felon, three-time divorcee, no talent ex-junkie. Well, you figured me out. Now just... why don't you get the fuck out of here? Everybody just calm down for a second. And what about that record deal, Grandpa? Record deal you pissed away? The record deal I don't need any of you for? Okay, you know what? You fucking two deserve each other. I'm out of here. Poor baby. (mumbles) What about you, Jimmy? You want to taste? Does this look tempting at all? Come on. [Jimmy] No thanks, I'm allergic. Whenever I do it, I break out in handcuffs. (chuckles) Come on, suck it. You know what? Let's get you home. You want to take me home? (snorts deeply) (cries out) (giggles) What's wrong with you? You know, we all carry the seeds of our own destruction, Mr. Klein. Wow, this is too fun. (chuckles) [Jimmy Voiceover] So there I am, scared out of my sack, throat burning like hell, mind fucking blown. Was the coke laced? Was I hallucinating? I didn't know what the fuck. The only thing I knew for sure was that wasn't Rachel anymore. Weeks went by, she disappeared again. I was dealing with my own personal freak out, and the boys were left wondering what the hell happened? Fuck, it's been two weeks. What do we do? We got to start jamming again. Yeah, well it looks like it's just going to be you and me. I don't know. She won't call me back and... I guess it's over. What's over, your new relationship or the band? Fuck you, dude, okay, shut up. Why would we put this much energy into it just to watch it crumble? This makes no fucking sense. Do we need, do we even need her? Yeah, we need her. And you'd have to admit, man, there's... What does Jimmy say we should do? I don't know, I mean... It's undeniable, she's one of a kind, dude. She's... She has something really special that a lot of people want that you can't learn. Yeah. [Jimmy] Scott was crushed. It was like a break up to him.

See this? To me, it's just a 25 cent piece of plastic. To them, it's a family fucking heirloom. Fifty-three year old bad boy, what a joke. [Scott] I'm going to say you don't look a day over 52. What? You motherfucker. What? Let me have one of those. Are you sure? Yeah. Dude, you just got your voice back. You shouldn't be smoking. Whatever happened to my voice had nothing to do with this. What did happen? What? She just kissed it and made it better. All right, very funny. Fine, if you don't want to talk about it, it's fine. No, she just kissed my neck. I got some crazy shock, and then... hurt like a motherfucker. So, what, she kissed you and cured you? You know what, I said she had mental problems, not magical powers. I've had every test known to man, but doctors don't know what the fuck happened. He wants to write me up in a medical journal. Yeah, at least somebody wants to write about you again. (dark synthesized music) (puffing) (electric buzzing) (man screams) Getting high and rock and roll go together like tits and ass, but now she was just killing for fun. Coming in hot! [Scott] It's 10:00 in the morning. Ooh, so? Yeah, so? I like your ride, Jimmy. (chuckles) Thanks. Is everything sparkling to you? What are you high on? I'm high on life, Jimmy! (laughing) (motor revving) (rock music) [Jimmy Voiceover] Of course, I had no idea. But goddamn it, every time she took another hit, we made another hit. It's got to be worth something, right? (thunder rumbling) ♪ I feel you in the autumn breeze ♪ ♪ And I smell you in the gentle fallen leaves ♪ ♪ And I see you every single day ♪ ♪ When all I want is for you to just go away ♪ ♪ Fade away from me ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Fade away from me ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Fade away from me ♪ ♪ Ooh fade away ♪ [Jimmy Voiceover] Right after that, Rick's girlfriend made him listen to the demo. And we got that record deal after all. We were signed, but we had to get Rick to support the record. I knew what he wanted for that. So I threw a party to set the mood. Hi, guys, it's your girl Kami, and you are #blessed for pressing play because we are here at the Hollow Body record release party with bad boy Jimmy Kleen. Jimmy, thanks for joining us. Yeah, it's my pleasure. Yes, and you're back! Yeah. Okay. Back from the dead. Clean living. Stay in school, don't do drugs. Oh, and there's the lead singer, Rachel. Who's that she's with? Who knows? Whoa! She's a wild child. Well. Just give me a second, all right? Pardon me. Sorry bud, can you just back off, all right bud? She's (mumbles) on me, asshole. All right, calm down, calm down. (head butt smashes) (girl giggles) - Sorry, excuse me. - Okay, no worries. Dude, turn that off. - Come on. - [Man] Dude, he hit me! Hey, hey, what the fuck, Jimmy? Rick's going to be here any minute. Can you stay sober for five fucking minutes? You had your fun, I'm having mine. Listen, you said you wanted a record deal. Well, here it is, so don't fucking blow it. I said I wanted to be in a band. Well, you are in a band. Now it's time to hit the high notes. We're not even performing tonight. Well, Rick's not sure about distribution, all right? So if you can just put on a little private performance for him, and convince him. (mysterious music) Let's not mince words. I fuck him, he pushes the record? Rock and roll. Rock and roll. Hey, what the hell was that? You all right? I'm fine. What's gotten into you? (chuckles) Isn't this what you wanted? I wanted you to be a better performer. I like the old you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you okay? All right, all right, come on, outside somewhere. Parking, get her outside, sort her out. All right. Wait for him there. Don't say anything stupid. Oh, hi, you're Rick Rollins. I am, yeah. I'm a such a fan of your label. I play drums in Hollow Body. - Rick. - This is Jimmy. - Hey, thanks for coming, bro. - Good to see you. - You met Zach, the drummer. - I did. You okay? No. You're bad. (chuckles) You are. Please. I'm not dead. Aren't you? Rachel, this is Rick. Hey, I'd shake hands, but I'll give you this instead. Save me from this scene. All right. Where are they going? Don't worry about it, all right? Settle down. (guests chattering) I got to be honest with you. I know you're an artist and everything, but you're so fucking hot. The only thing on my mind is, excuse me, fucking. You know, I got a place down in Cabo, we should go down there. We could do some songwriting, we can get to know each other better. I got a plane out at the Santa Monica airport, we can get down there in about two hours. All right, Rick. And just in case you don't make me come, let's talk business. I'm sorry? I want to open for your biggest act. I want a publishing deal, I keep 50% of whatever the band makes, and I want a million in marketing. To start. (chuckles) Wow. May I ask you a personal question? [Rachel] Anything. How old are you? Because you seem very mature for your age. Hmm, I'm older than I look. Well, you got fabulous genes. I get them from my mother's side. Why don't we move somewhere a little bit more... private? I'd love to. (slow rock music) [Jimmy] Zach, he loves playing the drums. Where are you going? Just move. Whoa, whoa, or what? What, you're going to headbutt me, too? I might just throw you in the fucking pool. - Stop it. - Oh, you're drunk. All right, we'll get you home. Yeah, where's home, huh? What, the house that Carrie kicked me out of or the apartment I can't afford? What's your fucking wife's problem? You didn't even touch her. The problem was I wanted to. But you decided not to do anything, all right? And that was a choice. Yeah. So deal with it. Is that her choice? No one's holding a gun to her head. (electric zaps) (Rick grunts) Hang on a second. Something's not right. You just need to relax. Yeah? Let it happen. (electric zapping) (moaning) (slow rock music) (ecstatic moaning) (electric zapping) (thunder rumbles) (static buzzing) (thunder rumbles) It's done. Let's go have a cigarette. I think I've earned it. I can see why she likes you. Rachel? Rachel. (laughs) Rachel. ♪ Oh, oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ (lightning crashes) ♪ You're dead like me ♪ ♪ Hey, you're dead like me ♪ (laughing) (thunder rumbles) ♪ You're dead like me ♪ Get out. Get out! Rachel! Wake up, wake up. Rachel? Rachel. She's gone. (gentle music) (excited breathing) (moaning) Yeah, yeah. Yeah. (electric buzzing) (moaning) (electric zapping) (lightning crashing) (woman screams) [Barb Voiceover] Rachel. (laughs) [Jimmy] Scott didn't know what hit him. When he woke up, all he remembered was that he finally got what he wanted, and regretted it. You'd think that killing the head of your label would be a bad thing. Out of respect for the family, I told Rick's dad it was a heart attack. They've been going around lately. So next thing you know, he's talking about throwing a benefit concert, and guess who managed to get on the line up? [Scott] Please come. [Carrie] How can we afford it? You're not getting paid. Well, it's a benefit. I mean, nobody's getting paid. An infant does not belong at a rock concert. We'll get like little baby headphones or something. Please, this is like the biggest show I've ever played. Good for you. You got everything you wanted. No, not everything. I... Oh, Carrie. No, I... Come on, don't. Carrie. (baby giggling) (thunder echoing) (dramatic music) (crowd roaring) Richie was a great friend, a brother, really. Struck down in his prime. Yeah, well, that's why we're here, right? Make something good come out of it. [ Zach] Can we just um, talk about the heart attacks? 'Cause every gig we do, someone dies. What, are we cursed? This is a benefit for heart disease. Have a fucking heart. [Zach] We're just going to sit here and act like nothing's happening? Just stick to the music, please, man! - Dude! People die all the time. Okay, well, let's just keep doing the interview. Talk about the first night, the party. Well, technically, we crashed that party. Technically? Definitely. Thank God, you did. I got something for you. Yeah? Earned it. No, dude. Yeah. You serious? Seriously. (gentle music) (moves into mysterious music) (camera flash zapping) Hi, babies. Wow! You like? You know it's raining out there. You're going to be freezing. Don't worry about me, baby. I'll outlive all of you. What are we drinking to? Hmm, me. How you feeling? Hmm... Never better. You'll never guess who's here. Surprise. Carrie? Hey. You look great. How she doing? Great. Nice headphones. I thought you'd like them. - What are you doing here? - It wasn't me, it was... it was Rachel. She arranged for us to come and wanted to surprise you. Thanks. [Carrie] Are you all right? Yeah, no, I'm much better now. [Gig Manager] Hollow Body, you're next. About time. Come, let's go freshen up in my dressing room real quick. Rachel, we don't have time for that. Relax, can't start without me. We did it, man, just like I promised you. Ugh, yeah. Come on, man, I thought you'd be happier. You've dreamt about this since the moment I met you. Yeah, but just not like this, man. Yeah, well, it's never the way you want it to be. Hey, Jimmy, you just, you're not hearing me though. It's... You're right, I'm not. Jimmy... Wow. This is, uh... this is pretty amazing. Don't think I've ever... been in a room with these many mirrors before. Yeah, it's kind of... a pre-show ritual. You get what you need? (chuckles) Oh, yeah. (static crackles) All right, boys. Where's Carrie? She'll be down in a minute. Don't worry, she's got the best seat in the house. Could you take a picture of me before the show? [Carrie] Yeah. I fucking knew it. Oops. Yeah, about that... You know, Carrie, you're very sweet. But Scott doesn't want sweet. He wants me. They're waiting for us, Rachel. Yeah, but you're not Rachel, are you? Not since the accident. Those heart attacks, they you, too? Who do you think you are? Look at me. You don't know what Scott wants. You think I'm sweet? There's more to me. Yeah? You don't know me. You don't know my family. You don't know Scott. What do you... You fucking know? (tense music) (electric zapping) (heavy breathing) Mm (chuckles) (laughs) Oh! (laughs) Oh. You're bad. It's show time. [Stage Manager] People, it's time, you're on! Jimmy, dude, what the hell are we going to do? We play. With that? - Oh, I've played with worse. - Dude, we're going to, Jimmy! Come on, let's go, ha ha ha! This is unbelievable. Zach, dude... (tense music) (baby crying) [Compere] Ladies and gentlemen, from Hollywood, California, Hollow Body. (guitar twanging) (lightning crashes) (crowd screaming) The strike killed us instantly. The fire took another nine people, injured, I don't know, 50. But you know what? They never found Rachel. Not a trace. Vanished. Always leave them wanting more. (footsteps echoing) They say death is the ultimate career move. I should know. What can I say? It's a living. ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Oh, fade away ♪ ♪ Fade away ♪ ♪ Hmm fade away, fade away ♪ ♪ Fade away, fade away ♪ ♪ Fade away, fade away, fade away ♪ ♪ Fade away, fade away, fade away ♪ ♪ Fade away, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah, oh ♪ ♪ Don't you, don't you, don't you fade ♪ ♪ Oh, don't you fade away ♪ ♪ Fade away, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Fade away, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Why you wanna know ♪ ♪ What I think about you ♪ ♪ Well, I don't know yet ♪ ♪ What I think about myself ♪ ♪ All I know is when I'm around you ♪ ♪ My cares just fade away ♪ ♪ What can I say ♪ ♪ I love you in every way ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ So, now I know ♪ ♪ How I feel about you ♪ ♪ But I cannot tell you ♪ ♪ 'Cause I don't want to scare you away ♪ ♪ How can I tell you that I think about you ♪ ♪ Every night and day ♪ ♪ What can I say ♪ ♪ I love you in every way ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ We're gonna hear all their wolves ♪ ♪ We're gonna hear them wolves ♪ ♪ They're always knocking on my door ♪ ♪ They're always knocking on my door ♪ ♪ Now I know what it's all for ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ ♪ You make the world worth fighting for ♪ ♪ It's just a perfect day ♪ (chuckling) (gasps and screams) [Ghost Rachel] Mom?
