My name is Pacu. It's a brand new name, so I'm not used to it yet. I'm trying to remember a story. Sometimes I can, Sometimes I get mixed up, Because there's another one stuck in my head, It's about me, my brother and a shirt in the wind, The blood is starting to turn yellow. Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! It's Papa, who drives the oxen round the mill, In Grandpa's time, the slaves did all the work, Now we do it. Tonio, my brother, crushes the sugarcane, Mama gathers the scraps, Bring more cane kid, Hurry up! Let's go, Blocky! Turn, Turn! Mama says God never gives us... heavier burdens than we can bear, But God keeps messing up, He sometimes dumps such burdens, on us, we all collapse, We live in Stream-of-Souls, It is in the middle of nothing, All we know its above the ground and below the sun, It's so hot that it sets our heart boiling... like a pot of mollasses, Tonio, I dreamed about In?cio again, Go back to sleep now! Go on, kid. and now, sleep. Go on, go on! The blood has turned yellow. Tonio... you know what you have to do. Don't go, Tonio. Your's brothers soul isn't at rest. he did what he had to do. It's Tonios turn now. Don't go. Listen to me, kid, Your grandfather, your uncles, your oldest brother... all died for this land and for our honor. One day, it could be you. You're a Breves, I too, did my duty. But it wasn't God's will that i die. Tonio, you'll leave at daybreak, And remember... you're only to seek out your brother's killer. Man to man, Face to face. Tonio will be walking over land that used to be ours, The Ferreiras took it from us and we took it back, Now it is theirs again, That's how the feud began, Papa says it is an eye for an eye, One of theirs for one of ours... and so on, until everyone ended up blind... In the land of the blind... one eyed people are said to be mad, Mother, May god consent, may it be god's will, May the soul of In?cio, my first born... find peace alongside his own! May each drop of his blood cost the enemy two. May you my son... find peace you never found among the living. And watch over your brothers when their turn comes, We're going for water. Yes, sir. Everything quiet Yes,Sir. Like this. Go outside, kid. For my brother! I won't pray for your grandson's soul,since he killed my son. But I respect your suffering. it's is the same as mine. Today, ours is greater. My son asks permission to attend the vigil... to pray for deceased's soul. Afterwards, if you accept, he'd like to talk to you. Where is he? Outside. Thank you. Good bye, my friend. I prayed for the deceased. I came to the wake and the burial. Now, I'd like to talk to you. I request a truce. Grandfather,, don't accord a truce. The Truce is granted. The same one your father granted to my grandson Until the next moon. From one death to the next. This is your gurantee until the full moon. After that, when the blood turns yellow, it will expire. How old are you? Twenty. Your life is now split in two. The twenty years you've already lived... and the short time you have left. have you ever known love You never will! Do you hear that clock Each time it ticks - one more, one more, one more... it will be telling you... one less, one less, one less. Whoa! Good morning. Morning. Do you know of of a little village... near here, called Born Sossagoa It's over there. But is is not little. It's not? What's this place called? Stream-of-Souls. So where's the stream? Dried up. Only the souls remain. What is your name? -Kid. -What? I don't have a name. -What do they call you? -They just call me kid. They call the kid"Kid" kid! Here, this is for you. Can You read? No. But i can read pictures. hey, kid! Stay from those vagrants! Mama thinks the blood stain will come out, but it won't come out, You did your duty, my son, Now you have much do before the next moon. Crush the sugarcane and fix the roof... in case it rains this year. It never rains. Then the raw sugar has to be sold in the village. That sounded like a bad dream, Tonio, i tried to wake you up, but you did'nt want to, What are you doing up, kid? Reading. Where'd you get that? A present. From who? The girl gave it to me. What girl? My friend, of course. -You went into town alone! -No. Tehy were lost. But not anymore. I showed them the way. Hmm. So, what the book about? It's about everything. Something's is wrong,kid. -What's wrong? -It's upside down. No, it's not. Want to bet! It's is the same this way... or that way. No difference,see? You don't know a thing about books. give it to me. -It's her! -TONIO,:Her? Who? The girl who gave me the book. She lieves in the sea with the fish, the crabs and the boats. She'll take with her. She'll teach me the alphabet and all. You don't believe me! When i grow up, we'll get married. -Has she been informed? -No. it's still a secret. one day... the mermaid comes up to the surface. And she saw the tree, the cows, the mountains and grass. When she looked at the top of the raw-sugar house... she saw the rooster with the mangy neck crowing for her. Ahh. Wow, she really like that! And she also saw the sugarcane, the mill... everything delighted her! But the best part of all was when she saw the kid. Are you still reading the book? Can't you see it will hurt your eyes I'm trying to remember the story. Sometimes I can, sometimes I forget. Then just forget. well? It is beginning to change color. it won't take long now. No, it won't. You're the most important merchant in town... but with all due respect, this isn't the right amount! Mr.LOURENCO,; No, It is the right amount! But i gave you the usual quantity. Steam power is bringing the price down. It's progress.. I think you should follow the example, Mr.Breves. But, Mr. Lourenco, we had an agreement! There is no shortage of raw sugar! Come on up! Come one, come all, if you want to watch... the snake and the toad dance! Everyone will come. Together we will go. tomorrow night, no one will sleep. No man, no woman, no child. Come one, come all! To the circus! Mr.Lourenco wants to decide other people's suffering. I saw her. Who? The Mermaid! Up on stilts! On what? She's in the circus. Yeah? They're bringing the circus to town... with a fire-eater, a clown... and a snake that dances with a toad. -A snake with what? -A toad. Yeah? hey, are you daydreaming, kid? More Cane! Keep turning! hurry up with that cane! Tonio I wan't to go to the circus real bad. You think Papa wil let you? We're like oxen here. We go round and round and never go anywhere. Let's go, kid. You want to see the circus! Hmm Then let's go See, I told you, she's hot stuff! fire! fire! I'll be damned...! I'm toasted! Salustiana, look who's here. Hey! It's the kid without a name. Anything's better than ?Salustiana.? My name's Clara. What's yours ? That's Tonio, my brother. Good evening. Did you like the show? I liked the fire best. You're really hot! Holy shit! i brought the book so you can remind me of the story. It's late now. SALUSTIANA,; hey kid... I'm going to give you a name. a name all your own. what is your favourite animal? do you like birds? he only like sea creatures. Oh, yeah/ Then I'll name you Sardine! Ha ha! You bullshitting me? We'll choose another name. Pacu. Pacu! I've christened you, You have a name now. And I'm your Godfather, Hmm! To celebrate your christening! -I don't like it, -TONIO,; What? The name. Pacu. He's pulling my leg. Pacu is a kind of river fish. Tonio. Do you think they sleep together? I don't know. All I know is, he's your Godfather now. Pacu. Pacu! Pacu! Pacu! Ha ha! Cut it out, will you? where'd you take the kid? Where? To the circus. Where? The circus. Go to your room, kid. Right now! Having fun at a time like this Have you no respect for our dead?

Did you see his black armband? Yes. He won't be around much longer. -What are you talking about? -It's true. it's a family feud. One side kills, then the other. -How do you know? -It goes way back. They're fighting for the land. They'd rather kill than solve their problems. AReal fanatics. It's like the two snakes I saw fighting. Each was biting the tail of the other. They ate each other up until nothing was left. nothing but a pool of blood on the ground. They'll all be killed off. Hmm. I feel sorry for them. I really do. Yah! Stay in line! Keep it going, Slowpoke! you're lagging! Keep turning! come on, Blocky! Keep it going! come on, Slowpoke! Get up, Slowpoke! that's good, my ox. Tonio! The oxen are going round on their own! Need some help? I can always use help. Especially if it's free. Where's my Godson? At home. Come for the circus?. Heh! You'll have to wait till next year. We're off to Ventura for the festival. Ever been to Ventura? No, I haven't been anywhere. Were you born dead or alive? What? Were you born dead or alive? alive! We'll I was born dead. True or False? True I'm afraid. Ha ha! Let me explain. My mother almost died giving birth. I was born purple-so purple they thought I was dead. True or False? They ignored me for two hours while trying to save my mother. Thenthey decided to wash me so I'd look decent for the funeral. As soon as i felt the cold water, I started howling. As a result, that was my first and last bath. No more baths! And the second result: Nothing bothers me. Anyone born dead has been through the worst. After that, life's a breeze. No kidding! So when it comes to water... I don't even use it for drinking! Ha ha ha! Yuck! Let's go, Bootleg! How long do you have? Not long. I'll go as far as Ventura, then I have to go back, Clara... Where are you? in this house, the dead command the living. Sometimes I wish Tonio wouldn't come back. Don't say that, woman. Even the worst life is better... than being slaughtered like an animal. look around you, woman. what do we have left? nothing. You see, we've already lost everything. And if tonio doesn't come back, we'll have lost our honor, too. let's go, Bootleg! Come on, Bootleg! Sleep well, young man? The mermaid couldn't live on land... because she had a fish tail... Where her legs should be. The poor thing couldn't walk. Even so, one day she got furious and jumped out of the sea! She started fighting with snakes and toads. Then because she missed the kid so much... she started puffing out fire and smoke. So the kid got on a tired old Ox... and galloped after the mermaid, Do-dum, do-dum, looking for the mermaid.. he went through the woods, the cane fields... and when he parted the last row of sugarcane... he came upon the sea. And he found the mermaid. Following in your brother's footsteps? Think you can just take it easy around here? Give me my book! give it to me! GROUP,;Die, you rabid dog! Da-mi-o! GROUP,;Die, you rabid dog! Take that! To hell with the traitor! Hah! Don't tell me shitty circus is still around, What did you say? You heard me! Shit what? Circus! Get out of here! You lousy bum! Ha ha ha! Reginaldo. Come here! Shitty things are impossible to get rid of. Like you. You mean like you. REGINALADO,;Is that clara? Your stepdaughter Spitting image of her mother. REGINALDO,;How she's grown! Do it right, kid. You're big enough now. Come, Tonio. I'm going to show you something, Tonio. Help me, Pull on the rope. CLARA,; Start turning , Turn it faster, Tonio. Faster! Even more! I'll never forget this... I'll never forget this.... or you. Neither will I, Tonio. Clara! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoa. Yah! The shirt is alsmost yellow now. it always turns yellow. with your permission... I could get the men together... and wipe those Breves from the face of this earth, i'll repeat this one last time, Blood has the same volume for everyone. You have no right to take more than the blood taken from you. otherwise, you'll pay twice-- in this life and in the next. That's what my father taught me and his father taught him. And that's how it'll be until I die. i taught you how to fly with this, remember? You were scared shitless! Tonio, today it is your turn. Huh? You take my place, I'll take yours.

Yes, it's is yellowed. you know what you have to do, then. yes, I know. Tonio,you know the truce ends today. From now on, it depends on the shirt. Don't go too far from the house. Stay close to me, And always carry the gun, it's going to rain. No, it's not the rainy season. I know it's going to rain. Tonio Pa took my book. I can't remember the story or the mermaid's face anymore. The mermaid... Had a fishtail... while the boy had toes, feet and... Aren't you going to sleep, Pacu? I can't, Tonio. It's too windy Then talk in silence. OK. Tonio. Clara... I wanted to tell you I've left everything. I'm heading east, to the coast. you have the right to do it, too! I'll be waiting. Now you know my story, But i still can't remember the other one, The mermaid, the ships-damn! The kid couldn't find the mermaid... no, it wasn't like that, Damn, It's is the mermaid who came looking-yeah, that's it I think I'm remembering it! One day, the mermaid came and took him to live with her, And he really liked that! She turned the kid into a fish... and took him to live in the east, at the sea, In the sea, everyone wasn't dying all the time, There was a lot of room for everyone, In the sea, they lived so happily... so happily, they couldn't stop laughing, Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha, in the sea, they wee so happy, so happy together... they couldn't help laughing. Tonio! Oh, God, not my son! Not my son! They've killed the kid. Get the gun, Tonio! Right now!
