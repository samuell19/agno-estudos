[bell ringing] [children] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America... [man]The vision of American education that made this a distinctive place, the school that would be open to the rich and poor alike, that institution is endangered in many places. And in some places, it seems almost irreparably lost. The public simply doesn't understand that their public schools are being taken away, that we are losing public education. City after city is losing public education. [man on megaphone] We want full and fair funding for our school district! [cheering] [Matt Damon]A battle is underway over who should control public education. Parents, teachers and activists are up against a well-organized coalition headed by business leaders and conservatives. Thank you all. Thanks. [Damon]They call themselves education "reformers" and many want to privatize America's public schools. Education reform will require changes in laws, rules and regulations. Most of the time, it's going to require a big political fight. Monopolies do not go quietly into the night. [chanting] - SOS! - Save our Schools! - SOS! - Save our schools! - They say cut back. - We say fight back! - Cut back? - Fight back! - Cut back? - Fight back! [Damon]Public schools educate nearly 90% of American students, about 50 million children, and represent a huge block of government spending, over 600 billion dollars a year. All that money, "reformers" say, can be managed more efficiently if the system is run like a business, where test scores are the bottom line, teachers are providers, and parents shop around for the school of their choice. Whether you're home-schooled, whether you go to online school, whether you go to a charter school, a traditional public school... We want the dollars to follow the student so that it's no longer a monopoly. Every one of our children should have a backpack full of cash, strapped on their back, and the schools should vie for the privilege of educating our kids and having that backpack turned over to them. [chanting] - What do we want? - More funding! - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - More funding! If you don't educate properly, all the people, then what is a democracy except a place where those with the money and the power determine the outcomes for everybody else? [chanting] Save our schools! Save our schools! Save our schools! Save our schools! Philadelphia is ground zero for what's happening across this nation in public education. We have a large number of charter schools and we have cyber charter schools, which are online schools. This privatization movement, the school reform movement, is happening very rapidly in Philadelphia and leading the public school system into a very difficult financial crisis. [man] Good morning! Gentlemen on the left, ladies on the right! Gentlemen over here on the left! Thank you. Late, late, late, late, y'all can't be late. What time does school start? Eight o'clock. Good morning. Let's get here before 8:00 o'clock! Good morning, good morning, good morning. How you doing? - Do you know who I am? - No. I'm Mr. Hackney, I'm the principal. - Nice to meet you. - Yes, I'm the principal, alright, - So if you need anything, let me know. - Okay. Okay? Alright, have a good day. [boy]Neither one of my parents graduated high school. And I really want to change that. I want to be the first person in my family to change, like, that cycle. I'm just trying to make sure I keep all my grades high and where they need to be so that I can have all the credits and everything I need to get into a college. So tell us how the first day is going. Well it's 11:30 and this day started for us around 7:00 AM this morning. We hope that the school year will go as well as the day has gone thus far. [Damon]As the new year began, the eyes of the nation were on Philadelphia whose troubled school system was on the brink of financial collapse. [Hite]I've been here 11 months. Immediately after I arrived, we communicated a budget that had a $304 million hole. Right after that, we had to lay off 4,100 individuals. We were advocating both at the city level for additional monies, and at the state level with the governor. [band playing] [Damon] In 2011, Republican Tom Corbett was elected governor with the backing of the Tea Party. Education funding was slashed by an estimated one billion dollars. Philadelphia bore the brunt of the cuts, losing nearly $300 million in state aid. [chanting] No ifs! No buts! No education cuts! No ifs! No buts! No education cuts! No ifs! No buts! No education cuts! [newsman]Since 2011, when the cutting began, Philadelphia's Northeast High School's budget for extra curricular activities has dropped to zero, it's budget for books, zero. This is 9th grade biology packed wall-to-wall with 62 students. [chanting] SOS! Save our schools! SOS! Save our schools! SOS! Save our schools! [girl]They just took away all the help that we need. We're not having counselors any more. They're just keeping us stuck at the same point without any help. They're just... they just want to see us fail. [chanting] Tell the whole wide world! This is people's territory! How are we gonna learn how to draw if we don't have art class, how are we gonna learn how to sing if we don't have singing class, if we don't have music? [cheering] [violin playing "Amazing Grace"] [newsman] A sixth-grader who died from an asthma attack after being sent home from school, a school that did not have a nurse on duty has set off sadness, regret and anger in Philadelphia, where public schools are facing a huge budget shortfall. Thousands of employees have been laid off, including nurses. One of the ways that you exhibit as a government and a society your love for children is in the institutions you build around them, and one of the most central of them is the public school. But in the Philadelphia public schools, you've got one nurse per 1,500 students. And then you contrast that with the enormous investment in specific charter schools, and it raises a lot of questions. [Damon] For almost two decades, Philadelphia had pinned its hopes on charter schools as the answer to its problems. Charters are privately managed but paid for with public school funds. In 2013-14, about one-third of the district's students attended 86 charter schools that ranged from tiny storefronts to fast-growing chains. [man]We are standing in our brand new flagship high school. We purchased this building this past June. It was one of the largest bond offerings in the country of a single charter school, close to 60 million dollars. [Damon] String Theory, which operates four of Philadelphia's high end charter schools, focuses on science and the arts. [teacher indistinct] [man]In this space on the first floor, we have our grand lobby, our orchestra rooms, ballet studios and a digital design suite with a motion capture studio. [computer voice]Leg up! Switch your foot around. Leg up... Other schools you get to work with pencil, books and other things, but here you just work with iPads, lots of technology. This is pretty much, like, our entire school in a nutshell. Just this tiny iPad, holds all of our courses... the iTunes U. So what do mitochondria do? If you don't know, open that keynote and find it. What do mitochondria do? What are they responsible for in the cell? You should know this already. [Kirp]Charter schools were originally conceived by a union leader, Al Shanker, as laboratories. So, new ideas, new pedagogies, new curriculum, new teaching strategies would be incubated in the charter schools, and that work would be adopted by the public schools. That was the hope. [Ravitch]The charter school movement began with the idea that charters would seek out the lowest performing students, they would seek out the dropouts, they would go out on the street and recruit the kids who had lost interest in school. And I thought that the charters would collaborate with the regular public schools. That was the original idea. But I was wrong. I was wrong on every count. Charters should serve the neediest. But with some very notable exceptions, they've become aggressive and entrepreneurial. [Damon] Diane Ravitch, former Assistant Secretary of Education under George H.W. Bush, was once a leading advocate for testing and school choice including charter schools. Now she crisscrosses the country, leading a movement to stop privatization and improve public schools. Who will stand up for public schools and their teachers? [cheering] It's time to organize, agitate and demonstrate. [people chanting] Diane! Diane! The corporate reformers are wrong. We have to say they're wrong. We must write letters to the editor, run for the school board, speak up, act up. History will judge us by what we do now. Thank you. [cheering] There are over two million students in charter schools today, thanks to the work of many people in this room. A hundred school districts... [Damon]Ravitch is opposed by those she calls, "corporate reformers," who say education, like social security and the military, will work better if the system is privatized. [Allen] Today we're still trying to break up those bureaucracies. changing rules about tenure, seniority, getting rid of union contracts, expanding the opportunities of these new public schools of choice like charter schools. I wanted to see if you guys could understand a bit of the action there... [Damon]Business-minded reformers claim that charter schools can do more with less. In education, the biggest expense is labor. And almost 90% of charters keep costs down by hiring non-union teachers. I know where I want to go. I am global. I am amazing. I can see what no one else sees. -[girl]I love who I am. -[boy] This is a String Theory School. [Kirp] Charter schools have become more corporatized, very competition-based, very market-based. And that's great if you're selling soap. But it doesn't work in education. It never has worked in education. [Gym]Charter schools like String Theory can promise the world. But what's desperately unfair is to pretend that that's public education. It's absolutely not. It's an opportunity for a small group of students to be living on islands of privilege amidst a sea of inequity for the majority of young people in Philadelphia. [Damon]In 2013-14, more than 142,000 students, two-thirds of the district's total still attended traditional public schools like South Philadelphia High. [Mr. Hackney] Good morning! Good morning, ladies! We will have another great day here at Southern High School. Good morning, y'all. How ya' doin? We're at a 97% poverty rate. We have a large immigrant population. We have about 19 different languages spoken in the school. I have students that have some issues and we want to make sure that we can provide them with as much support as possible so they can still get to school every day, and function every day, and if they need some support because of a crisis situation, that we can help them. - You learned English in four years? - Mm-hm. - How did you do that? - There's no Indonesian, so I have to force myself to speak English. [boy] My father, he had a stroke. My mom is the only one working in our house and trying to support our family. All the cleaning, all the responsibilities and duties in our house, is my job. I'm just happy to become a senior and to be alive because from where I'm from, a lot of kids do not even make it to be 18. [police sirens] In my neighborhood, is a lot of violence, a lot of shootings. Anything else you guys need? - Yes... - What else do you need now? [girl]I have a one year old daughter named Michaela. Coming here, they made it possible for me to still come to school, take care of my daughter and go to work. In 2010 there was a big, um, earthquake in my country and my house collapsed. You're interested in building? You know, I've got three children in the Philadelphia public schools. I'm also a former teacher. I'm a daughter of immigrants. I have a deep sense of what public schools did for me. I thought this was a society that tried to do that for everybody and to care for everybody. [Damon] As publicly funded schools, charters are required by law to be open to all students. [Corosanite] Anybody can go to the school district and say, "Hey, you know, we heard about that amazing new String Theory High School, it's the most exciting high school we've seen in a generation in Philadelphia. How can we apply to it? [Damon] Students from around the city can submit applications, and are chosen by lottery to fill a limited number of seats. But critics allege that many charters have found ways to "cherry pick" students likely to get higher test scores. Some charter schools do a very good job about enrolling children equally. Many charter schools, unfortunately, have put up barriers to enrolment that keep out the most disadvantaged children. [speaking Spanish] [Brownstein] Some charters require children to buy uniforms that are extremely expensive. We have intervened as attorneys on behalf of children who were turned away from their charter school because they couldn't afford a 200 dollar blazer they were required to buy. My mom could barely afford my Girls High uniform that's only like 15 dollars, so we can't really... Charter school isn't really an option for me. [Damon]Charters suspend and expel children at far higher rates than public schools in some places. Charters have come under fire for using harsh discipline to weed out students with learning and behavioral issues. At Success Academy charters in New York City, students are required to keep their eyes locked on the teacher and their hands folded. Mastery, a so-called "No Excuses" charter chain based in Philadelphia, has a Code of Conduct that includes disciplinary actions for students who "roll their eyes", "suck their teeth" or have an "untucked shirt." Otis, if a student's at the front door and they have an I.D. and they want to come in and register, they can come in and register, right? - Yeah, we're still doing registration. - Yeah, I thought so. [Hackney]I get new students every day from charter schools, literally, every single day. - Where was she before? - Mastery Charter. She was at Mastery Charter? And you're coming here - to register her? Alright. - Mm-hmm. We do get students that are counseled out of charter school before it becomes a disciplinary transfer, because, you know, all you have to do is say to a parent, you know, "If this happens, it's going to be on your child's record. So maybe you should go to your neighborhood school." If I'm the neighborhood school I have to take you. I need to talk to you about this, actually, the top 54 districts. We have represented children who, for example, if they had a serious disability, wouldn't be told directly, "You can't come to this charter school," because that would be blatantly illegal. But they would be encouraged not to attend, they'd be told, "This is really not the right choice for you. You'd be better off in the district school." In order for charter schools to save money, in order for charter schools to try to lower their costs, they need to send the most expensive children to educate, back to school districts. It's wrong, but the system is built so that they are able to do that. [Damon]In 2012-13, Philadelphia's neighborhood public schools served, on average, more than twice as many English learners as charter schools, twice as many 9th graders involved with child welfare and juvenile justice... and more than twice as many students with autism. [man] So the question is pretty simple, but pretty important. We have a diverse city and we're here to support all children and right now, you're not serving that diversity. So what are you going to do about it? We want this school to be much more diverse than it is and pull from all around the city, and we are working on those measures to do that as best as we can. [Damon]In 2013-14, at one String Theory school, over two-thirds of the students were white, in a district where whites made up less than one quarter of the student population. [woman]We know that some charters do a very good job, but often it turns out that the charters won't take the same students, the low achieving students are pushed out and left behind. The Southern Poverty Law Center had to bring a lawsuit in New Orleans because children with special education needs were being rejected from all of the charter schools. Nobody would take them. [Damon]Despite evidence of discriminatory practices nationwide, charter schools have become "go to charities" for some of the nation's wealthiest donors. Bill and Melinda Gates, Los Angeles real estate billionaire, Eli Broad, and the Walton Family, heirs to the Walmart Fortune; head the foundations known as the Big 3 backers of charters and school choice. The Walton Foundation is the Walton family. They are the richest family in the United States. The Walton children collectively are worth 93 billion. And they give a lot of money to charter schools around the nation. [Damon]The Broad Foundation runs a Superintendent's Academy to train school leaders, and has spent over 100 million dollars on charter schools. There is a great effort to say that charter schools are better than public schools, because look at all the wonderful resources they have. But there are organizations pumping those resources in, in order to make showcases of the charter school to make the case to have more charter schools. The Angel Network is giving each of your charter school networks one million dollars. [cheering] A million dollars for you... A million dollars for you... A million dollars for Mastery... And a million dollars for Sci Academy! Yay! [Damon]Charter schools outperform traditional public schools in some places. But nationwide, on average, there is little difference in student achievement, according to a recent study by Stanford University. [Ravitch] The charter schools with all the advantages they have: They can skim the students that they want, they can kick out the students they don't want. They should be absolutely blowing the lid off all the test scores and they're not. [Kirp]There's no evidence that charter schools across the board do better than public schools. So you'd think school reformers who want the quick fix, the instant solution would look at the data and say, "Huh, maybe we went down the wrong path." The problem isn't the public school system. The problem isn't that we need some market based reform or answer. The problem is that we need to invest more in our public schools. [Hackney] The bulk of the students are still in public school so we have to provide them with the academic environment that they need so that they can be successful. But right now in this cash strapped district, it's very, very, very difficult. We are in my library... without a librarian. To have a school without a librarian is, from an educational perspective, darn near criminal. We are tearing down a fundamental pillar of democracy, which is a free public school, uh, system that is open to all children regardless of their backgrounds. We are creating a two-tiered system, where some children will get an excellent education and other children will not. How many people said true? So once you have a debt, you pay it off then everything is okay? - You writing in the same place? - [teacher] Yes. I didn't think I would be able to go to college having had a baby so early. But now that the counselor is helping me a lot with college admissions, I feel like I could go to college now. SAT's are good enough for Wilson. [chanting] - Whose schools? - Our Schools! - Whose schools? - Our schools! We've got parents here. We've got students here. We've got... [cheering] - We've got teachers here. - [all] Yeah! We are going to stand united in the face of an overwhelming attack on public education. I love Pennsylvania! I love Philadelphia! We're standing up because we're tired of what they're doing to this beautiful city we're living in. They are robbing our kids! And it's wrong. Let me tell you how I need music. I need to play my violin like peanut butter needs jelly. [laughing and cheering] I need art like a tree needs leaves. I need a fully-funded public education simply because I deserve it! [cheering] [Gym]There's no question that if people care about how education is going to look, and what it's going to be in this country, they need to look at what's been happening in Philadelphia. They need to understand why communities are pushing back so hard on it and why parents are so engaged. [choir vocalizing] I'm waking up I'm waking up I feel it in my bones To make my system go Welcome to the new age To the new age Welcome to the new age To the new age Whoa-oh-oh-oh Whoa-oh-oh-oh I feel it in my bones to make my system go Welcome to the new age [Damon] In Philadelphia, and most U.S. cities, students still have the choice to attend a traditional public school. But New Orleans has the first school district in the country where nearly all the public schools are privately run. [newswoman] After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans infrastructure was virtually wiped out. Public housing units, hospitals, schools, universities shut down. Many of these public institutions have not been reopened and some contend this is part of an effort to privatize New Orleans. [Damon]After the storm, the state took over almost all the district's public schools and some 7,500 teachers and employees were fired. Education reformers from around the country saw an opportunity to build a new, privatized school system from scratch. It was sad there had to be a storm for that school system to be blown up. It should have been blown up years before. The school board was removed. Charter schools created more opportunities for choices. Yes, we needed help with our schools. But it was never an intention to improve public schools. It was about privatizing public education, not improving public education. [Damon] In New Orleans, school "choice" didn't stop with charters. In 2008, parents got the chance to use vouchers: the most controversial school reform of all. [bell ringing] [woman] Alright, let me see some straight lines. [all] Good morning, dear Jesus, this day is for you, I ask you to bless all that they say and do. We love you God. Amen. [woman] We can provide them with so much more than just academics. We can pray in our school, public schools can't do that. Without prayer we don't see how anything could really happen. [teacher] Three, two, one... [Damon] Families use vouchers to pay tuition at private and religious schools, while taxpayers foot the bill. [teacher] Okay, okay, put your boards in the "Do Not Touch" position! [man]Are your kids in a failing school? If you live in Orleans Parish and meet income requirements, you may be eligible to send them to the private school of your choice for free. [woman] We finally get a choice in our children's education. And they finally can attend a safe and high quality school. People shouldn't be confused whether it's called a scholarship or some other name they invent for it, it is still a voucher. Your tax dollars are being used to pay for private education. [Damon] In many states, opponents have filed lawsuits, claiming that vouchers violate the separation of church and state, by giving tax money to religious schools. [teacher] we praise you for today. In Jesus's name... [children] Amen. [Damon]But advocates argue for vouchers on behalf of low-income parents. We need to empower parents. They know best what meets the needs of their children, certainly better than the government. [Damon] Parents, however, were not the only power behind vouchers in Louisiana. In 2011, wealthy donors wanted to make the state a school reform showcase for the nation. Outside money is coming into local races, local elections, local decision-making. The biggest name is the Walton Foundation. [man]During the 2011-2012 election cycle, over $2,500,000 was spent to elect the State Board of Education members. Today is truly a great day for Louisiana. Today is... [Damon] With his political allies in place, Governor Bobby Jindal, created one of the largest statewide voucher programs in the country. This is about choice, accountability, providing a great education to every child in Louisiana. It was not about helping these poor little school children get access to better schools. It was about politics, and making sure that the religious conservatives in Louisiana had a way to continue their schools at public expense. This was the great unwinding of what we had previously known as public education, the move to privatize it all. [Damon] In 2013-14, 126 Louisiana private schools, most of them religious, received vouchers worth an average of $5,300 each at a cost of around $36 million to taxpayers. Louisiana says you can take your money out of the public school and hand it over to virtually anybody who says, "I'll teach you," with minimum accountability. In some cases, no accountability at all. [man] We have just under 700 students. Roughly 485 voucher students are on the Louisiana State Scholarship Program. We give them a phenomenal education, but we also tell them, "You have a Heavenly Father, He loves you. You didn't come from a piece of slime you didn't evolve from an ape." We do believe in creationism, that literally all of mankind came from what's now right in the middle of Iraq, the Tigris and Euphrates River where the Garden of Eden was. We do teach them the theory of evolution, and why we believe that that is not true. There are textbooks being used in schools that receive voucher dollars, state taxpayer dollars, that purport that men and women and dinosaurs gathered together at the same time and at the same place. That is information being presented as factual. [Lesage] We do paddle students here. A quick paddle, it's amazing what it can do for a child and it's biblical. The bible says in Proverbs, spanking a child won't kill him, you know, if you do it right. [Damon] Louisiana's new laws allowed voucher and charter schools to recruit unlicensed teachers, opening the door to hiring practices not allowed in public schools. That school which receives state dollars, lots of state dollars, is allowed to choose its applicants with queries that no corporation in America would ask their employees, for fear of lawsuits. [Damon] Despite mixed results, vouchers are supported by religious leaders of many faiths. Our students and our families have particular needs. They have particular requirements in the way we're educated and the process of education is something that has to be suited and tailored for each individual community and their needs. [Damon] Thanks to vouchers, thousands of parents who used to pay tuition can now send their children to private schools, at taxpayer expense. You got to remember public education is for a public good. But if schools are able to use their religious doctrine on the public dime, that's not for a public good. I believe voucher schools spells the end to public education. Public education has to be valued. Otherwise the communities will continue to fracture. Then America becomes Babel. We don't meet each other. We don't know each other, we become more suspicious of each other. That America becomes a totally different place. [Damon] But private school "choice" is growing. In state after state, reformers are overcoming legal hurdles by repackaging vouchers as "scholarships" financed by tax credits. [Damon] Under Governor Corbett, Pennsylvania doubled the size of its private school "scholarship" program, leaving even less money for public schools, like South Philadelphia High. [chattering] [man] When I think of a vibrant high school, I think of bringing everyone together and then giving everyone the same opportunity. And that's what I always thought we were about. That is the dream of the public school. [Damon] Like public schools across America, South Philly was the first rung on the ladder of success for generations of young people. Graduates include: a president of Howard University, leading doctors and judges, professional athletes... high-ranking military officers, Hollywood actors and entertainers. And a remarkable array of musicians and singers: Marian Anderson... [slow tempo music playing] Eddie Fisher... Frankie Avalon... [upbeat music playing] And Chubby Checker. [Larocco] With the way the budget is, we don't have a music teacher, so you know, there is really no music in the school. There's all kinds of treasures from the past that show how much more vibrant the school was. We still have all those uniforms. Now without a music teacher, we don't have a band. [Brownstein] The district schools have shrinking money because that money is now being shifted over to charter schools. Last year, Philadelphia school district paid 700 million dollars to charter schools to educate children, but at the same time the district didn't have 700 million dollars in savings. [Damon] When a child leaves a public school to go to a charter, their so-called "backpack full of cash," a set amount of funding per pupil, goes with them. The problem is that children leave from many different public schools. And the school district still has to pay for the same teachers, for keeping the lights on, for transporting all the kids who still go to those public schools. But now the district has less money. [Gym]This year alone, the school system expanded charter schools by over five thousand seats at a cost of a 139 million dollars that formerly went to public schools. So there is a massive effort underway right now to disinvest in public education. We saw dramatic consequences when Philadelphia ended up closing 24 public schools. I was at Bok Tech High School last year and we was just trying to figure out what we could do to keep it open. Everybody was disappointed because we all were looking forward to graduating with all the same teachers, and just everybody being together. I didn't want to start over, like, making new friends and everything. [Hackney] We have a large number of students from Bok Technical High School that was closed. Even though the student population has more than doubled, my staff has not. Last year, I had three assistant principals. This year I have two. I had four counselors last year, this year I have 2. So it is a big difference. - Can I talk to her? - Here. Hello. Hi, this is the principal. Go down next door, where the door's open. There should be a teacher in there... I hope. [speaking Spanish] This is a great school. This is where my sister studied and where I studied. Everybody was nice in the school. We were like a family because we took care of one another. And right now I don't know what happens, the other school is so far and I am worried about that, I am sorry. I don't know what happen right now with you. [Damon] Boris's old school, a neighborhood institution for generations, had consistently met federal guidelines for academic performance. But it was closed because enrollment was down. It's become a national trend, mass school closings. Fifty schools closed in Chicago this year alone. Twenty-three in Philadelphia. In the 23 schools that closed in Philadelphia, 81% of the students affected were black, 11% Latino, 4% are white, 93% low income students. Why is that? Why is this happening in those neighborhoods? There are charter schools and private schools that are siphoning away students. But also, I think, it's been hard for folks in those communities to organize on the ground level to push back. So thousands of students, part of our most vulnerable communities, are now being further destabilized. [Boris]I'm not really happy that I have to change to a new school. The new school is far away. About 30 minutes walking. [car honking] My mother and my sister work. So most of the time, I have to walk by myself. [Damon] At the new school where Boris was reassigned, enrollment was dropping after a charter school opened in the same neighborhood. Boris? Extinct means a type of species of animal or person is no more. [teacher] Okay, alright. [Damon]Boris's school had to let six teachers go, and parents worried that it might be the next to close. [speaking Spanish] When I'm president, I'm going to open many more schools and I'm going to try to build more schools. [Damon] The state controlled School Reform Commission runs the Philadelphia school district, and also oversees the city's 86 charter schools. But, in Philadelphia, most charters face close scrutiny just once every five years when their contracts come up for renewal. The laws of most states are written so that they can keep their finances and their operations private. They operate mostly in secret. Revoking charters are very difficult decisions because of the potential impact and implication to children and their families. This recommendation is based on serious academic underperformance and billing for students not enrolled at the school for $700,000. [newswoman] The Walter Palmer Charter School has shut its doors for good. Now, parents have to find new schools for their children in the middle of winter break. This brings the number of students displaced from closing charters in Philadelphia this year to 1,500. The district alleges that Palmer billed it for hundreds of students who were not enrolled. [Harper Royal]When those dollars go to charter schools, that's just like throwing money into an empty hole. You have no way to impact it at all. At least if I don't like the way my local school board member has performed or how the schools have performed, I don't have to vote for that person again. Privatizing public education has taken away the public's voice over how public dollars are spent. [Brownstein] When you have access to public dollars and a lack of oversight, there is going to be an increased number of fraudulent schemes that drain taxpayer dollars and rip off families. [Damon] In Philadelphia alone, at least 19 charter schools have been under federal investigation, and four charter officials have gone to federal prison. And yet, charters remain the most popular of all the free market school reforms. - [audience applause] - [Jon Stewart]Her latest book is calledReign of Error. Please welcome back to the program, Diane Ravitch. For me, the most surprising thing in the book is you spend a great deal of time, one of the assumptions that we make in this country is that the public education system is broken. You make the case here that is not correct. Actually, no, it's not true at all. The test scores today are the highest they've ever been in history, graduation rates are the highest they've ever been in history. When I say this to audiences, they're shocked to hear it. They don't believe it. They've heard American education is worse than ever. It's not true. Test scores today are the highest they've ever been in American history. They're the highest ever for white kids, black kids, Hispanic kids and Asian kids. And the dropout rates are the lowest they've ever been. And people are shocked to hear this because there has been this constant din of "failure, failure, decline, decline." Not true, not true. ["Hail to the Chief" playing] [Damon] The notion that America's schools were "failing" became widely accepted after the signing of the federal law known as "No Child Left Behind." As of this hour, America's schools will be on a new path of reform... and a new path of results. Children must be tested every year in reading and math. Every single year. Not just in the third grade or the eighth grade, but in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh and eighth grade. "No Child Left Behind" assumed that what you could do is simply drive reform by setting targets on high stakes tests, and punishing schools if they didn't meet the targets. [Damon] "No Child Left Behind" demanded that all students show steady progress on state tests. The federal law set a goal of 100% proficiency by the year 2014. If students failed to make enough progress each year, their schools faced tough sanctions. Reformers called for accountability and jumped on the testing bandwagon. Growing numbers of public schools were labeled "failing". Many were closed, and converted into privately-managed charters. There's not a single country in the world that would even come close to having its schools reach this 100% proficiency target. So it is a shell game and it's intended to make the public schools look like they are failing. [Damon] Test-based reform intensified in 2009 under the Obama administration, with "Race to the Top." [Obama] This is one of the largest investments in education reform in American history. With the "Race to the Top Fund," states that outperform the rest will be rewarded with a grant. But let me be clear: Success should be judged by results, and data is a powerful tool. [Damon]Tennessee was one of the first states to win a "Race to the Top" grant. [teacher] Alright, number 32. It says, "What grade are you in?" What grade are you all in? - [children] Kindergarten! - Okay, that's the one that begins with a... "K." It's the very first bubble. We're almost done. [woman] We start off the year testing, we have testing in the middle of the year, and we have testing at the end of the year. Sometimes it just seems like all we do is assess. Go ahead and open your Netbooks and make sure that they're on and that you're logged in. [Damon] With the $500 million federal grant, Tennessee took data-driven reform to a new level, using tests to evaluate teachers and shape the curriculum. [teacher] OK. Ready? Do you guys have any questions? Okay, you have 15 minutes. You may begin. In Tennessee, we are spending $183 million just at the state level over a five to eight year period on standardized testing. The testing companies really are driving the direction of education. We have actually had administrators in our County tell us, "If it's not tested, don't waste your time teaching it. If it's not tested don't teach it." And I think that's sad. I think that's incredibly sad. You have five minutes to finish part one. What we're doing with this overwhelming dependence on testing is to crush creativity and to say, "Every question has a right answer." And in life every question doesn't have a right answer. We're teaching them to find the right answer that the test maker has chosen. Okay, stop. This is the end of math, part one. We will take a five minute break before we start our next section of the test. My daughter last year, when she was in third grade, we figured out that she spent about 30 days just taking standardized tests. [Kirp] The saddest part of the story is that the test prep, test prep, test prep focus, is heaviest in schools in poverty areas. So, poor kids who are just getting a diet of reading drills and math drills, are getting a joyless education. Come over and get your clicker and turn it on and make sure your clicker is working. Get the one that is your number. Okay, are you guys ready to practice so we can get ready for our TCAP test? [teacher] We have our TCAP test which is four days at the end of the year. We do DIBELS assessment, which tests how many words they read per minute. We do a spelling assessment to see their level, two or three times a year. We do constructed-response assessment for math, three times a year. We do a writing assessment every year. Next year, we will take the new test to go with Common Core. Ready? Okay. Number 1: Which sentence uses the correct punctuation? I am so excited about my party. So push in your answer A, B, C or D, on the clicker, push SEND, and then put your thumb up so I know you're ready to move on. I've sat through those classes. I could barely sit still for 42 minutes. Um, they're asked to do it for 12 years. Here's how I scored the lesson. And here's how you self-scored the lesson. As you can see, we're on the same page. [Damon]Incentivized by "Race to the Top," in 2014, 35 states, including Tennessee, tied teacher evaluations to student scores on state tests. And here are the numbers. Your numbers are real good numbers, very high! - You're doing a very good job. - Okay. Thank you. - Do you remember? - Dr. Seuss. Dr. Seuss. [Damon] But over half of Tennessee teachers taught subjects or grades that did not have state tests. [Frogge]All of the teachers that teach kindergarten through second grade, foreign language teachers, art and music teachers, do not have their own test results. So the vast majority of teachers are being evaluated based on test scores from other teachers' classrooms. For example, a gym teacher would be rated on how the third and fourth graders perform in math and literacy. [laughing] So that's the fatal flaw with the evaluation system. [Sheriff] You have five minutes to finish. It is really on our shoulders for the children to do well on the test this year. The stress level has skyrocketed from when I started teaching. Thank you for working so hard. Close your Netbooks. [Darling-Hammond] We're creating incentives for teachers to not want to teach, to be evaluated in ways that are unstable, unreliable and inaccurate. That's driving good people out of teaching. [man]Public education in our state is under assault. Right? We all know it is absolutely under assault. Right now, our count is there are 59... privatization lobbyists in the statehouse. They're all there in masse. And we are the ones that are going to engage in the conversation we must have for salaries, benefits and teaching conditions at our local level. With "Race to the Top," my ability to teach is a number now. That's why I joined the union and started realizing we've got to lobby against the testing. I wanted to be a teacher and a coach. I wanted to be thought of well and do a job that's honorable. And in the last 25, 30 years the narrative has been teachers are selfish, and people believe that. Teaching is a calling. Teaching is something that's in your blood, and you feel compelled to do it and you do it not because of the money but in spite of the money. [Damon] Central to the reform agenda is an effort to weaken the power of teachers unions, which represent almost four million members across the country. At the national level, who deserves a punch in the face? Oh, the National Teachers Union. They're not for education for our children. And they are the single most destructive force in public education in America. You look at the way we compensate teachers. It's no exaggeration to say we basically pay teachers based on how long they've been breathing. [crowd laughs] Which is why we're proposing to change the tenure rules so that if you have tenure, if you're an ineffective teacher, you lose that tenure that first year. [cheering] Teachers across this country are so demoralized. Almost 30% of teachers say they are ready to quit. That's a million teachers ready to quit. The latest survey that I saw said we now have a teaching force where the single largest group of teachers are in their first year of teaching. I find that alarming. [Damon] In the fall of 2014, Philadelphia's School Reform Commission, or SRC, issued a direct challenge to teachers and their unions. [chanting] Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! [newswoman]The commission canceled its contract with the Philadelphia teachers union. Teachers are angry and many say they feel blindsided by the sudden move. This meeting of the School Reform Commission is adjourned. Thank you everyone. [newswoman]Now the SRC is requiring them to pay into their health coverage, something the teachers see as a pay cut. [chanting] Shame on you! Shame on you! Given the fiscal environment in which we are facing, we all have to share in the sacrifice in order to provide our children with what should be very basic resources. There are other ways that they could have found money to fund our schools instead of taking it off the back of working people. [chanting] The people united will never be divided! The people united will never be divided! Philly is ground zero for what should not happen in terms of children. They pit teachers against kids, parents against teachers. What has happened in this city is morally bankrupt. [newswoman]Two days after the union's contract was cancelled, some high school students walked out of class to support their teachers. [kids chanting] My daughter lies on the bed and I sit at the desk and turn the screen this way, with a book in my hand, and, you know, we do lessons that way. We're usually in our pajamas. [laughing] What you see is 16X. Do you see any other X's? She was attending public school and was just having trouble keeping up. I don't, like, feel like waking up in the morning all the time, going to school and stuff. And plus sometimes school can be violent, and sometimes there's fights and sometimes it's like the peer pressure and the bullying from the teachers and the students can be hard. Here no one bothers me. [Damon] With cyber schools, cost-conscious reformers have eliminated the need for teachers in classrooms, and even school buildings! In 2013-14, students were going to school online from kindergarten through 12th grade, paid for by taxpayers, in 30 states, including Pennsylvania. [computer and Imani speaking Spanish] [computer] Frogs and humans are both part of the phylum chordata and the subphylum vertebrata. All vertebrates have a backbone. You don't necessarily need to touch a frog to learn how to dissect a frog. I mean, you're doing it virtually. If anything, you can learn better just by not touching it because you're not thinking, "Eww, the skin. Eww!" [Damon] Imani's school, Agora Cyber Charter, was run by K12, Inc., the nation's largest for-profit online learning company. We offer a full time education with teachers, curriculum, at about a 40% less per child than the typical brick and mortar school. If every student across the United States were in online schools, it'd be several hundred billion dollars a year savings to taxpayers. They do what American business likes to do, or what all global businesses like to do, is they cut cost. They have no custodial services, no librarian, no social workers, no playground. Teachers may have a class of 80 or 100 or 200 or 300, one never knows. [teacher on computer] And that's what brings us into the next part of the story... - [baby wailing] - which is the rising action. Who is that in the background? That is my daughter. She is at home with me today. She actually just woke up only about 15 minutes ago, right before class. [baby wailing] Not happy. Most of my teachers are young, like they kind of just got out of college, they kind of, you know, just started a family. So we all know that they are going to have children or little kids around. [teacher]Every story has to take place somewhere. Everything about a setting is important so you have to pay attention to all of it. Education to me involves an interchange between a student and a teacher, a human being, looking into the eyes of the teacher, seeing approval or disapproval, interacting with other students, discussing problems, finding out that other people have better ideas. That's education. Education involves a certain social dimension and that's what the cyber charters can never recreate. - [teacher]You are free to go. - [baby wailing] Have a wonderful rest of the day. [Imani] P.E. online is quite easy. It'll say like just, "Did you do ab work? Did you run? Did you do your chores?" And you could just click A or B, or, you know, so... And then you just submit it and you get an A. The most profitable kind of school to start is an online school because, as one for-profit school chain realized, you can take $12,000 a kid from the state, pay $2,000 to put them online with a computer and pocket the rest. [Damon] K-12 CEO, Ron Packard, received compensation of $5 million in 2011. In 2014, K-12 made a profit of 55 million dollars on revenue of nearly a billion dollars, much of it taxpayer money from cyber schools. I really believe that technology, because it's scalable, has the ability to help, not just millions of kids but really every child on the globe. [Damon] In Philadelphia, in 2013-14 nearly 7,000 students were enrolled in cyber charters. As a result, about 76 million taxpayer dollars that would have gone to public schools, including Imani's neighborhood school, George Washington High, went to online companies like Agora. At the end of the day, my daughter needs an education. So if the money needs to be allocated to Agora, then so be it. [Jeb Bush] We need to embrace technology in a way that could transform how our education system works. Digital learning is ultimately going to be commonplace across the 50 states, and it will be a joyous occasion when it does. There is no high quality research that has ever been conducted that shows that this is a good method of teaching and learning. They're doing terrible, yet they are attracting people because they spend a lot of money on marketing and sell parents a bill of goods about how fantastic their cyber charter is going to be. [Damon] Despite dismal performance, online education is one of the fastest growing forms of school choice. [cheering] [Hackney] Thank you! Thank you very much! Fantastic job, everybody. Thank you very much. [man]This is a big building, it's five stories tall. We have three elevators, the last of which stopped working about a month ago. And the school district said, "We don't have money to fix it right now." To me, it's just like this sort of perfect metaphor for what's going on. There's a lot of broken elevators in the system right now and there's no money to fix them. From a facilities standpoint it's been, uh, brutal. I have one custodian to help keep the building clean. - Hello, how you doing today? - I'm good. [Hackney] I'm really talking about, you know, 1,200 students. [Cruz]This year I've converted into Islam. You know, what you learn today, you're like, "Oh, yeah..." I'm looking forward to going to college next year and staying focused on learning. I can just get ready for after high school, and going into the real world, and becoming an adult. In the past few months, a lot of my friends have been either been shot, locked up, and two of them actually died, so, I know me graduating is definitely going to be a way for me to get out of the city and just go and live my life at college. I'm the captain of the football team. My football coach is like a second father to me. He kept me focused. He really has changed my life. [Bush] This isn't just about saving the... [Damon] Education reformers insist that all students reach the same high standards, regardless of their circumstances. [Bush] We all know the challenges we face, a system that blames the failures of kids on parents, on budgets, on socio-economics. We know better. Look, poverty is not an excuse. [sighs] One of the taglines that the so-called school reformers like to say is that "poverty is not an excuse." All children can learn. Of course all children can learn. Those of us who grew up in poverty, we know it's not an excuse. We are simply talking about the things that we need to put in place to level the playing field. [Gym]Philadelphia has the highest poverty rate of the largest U.S. cities. We've got children who suffer from third world problems, starvation and hunger, for example. And they deserve to come into a system that is the absolute best that we can give them. There is no question that the primary cause of low academic achievement or low test scores is poverty. On every test that's given anywhere in the world, the kids of highest poverty are at the bottom of the test. The S.A.T, the A.C.T, the federal tests, the state tests, every test, they all show the kids from the highest income group are at the top, and the kids from the lowest income group are at the bottom. Unfortunately, the United States has tremendous child poverty, much more so than other advanced nation in the world. [Damon] In the United States, children who have the fewest resources at home, often get the fewest when they go to school. Philadelphia, where over 80% of students are low income, spent around $12,500 per pupil in 2013-14. Just across the city line, Lower Merion, a wealthy suburb, spent nearly twice as much, over $20,000 per pupil. Lower Merion recently opened two one-hundred million dollar high schools. When people say that money doesn't matter, when they say that we're spending too much, what I hear them saying is that to them, children in poverty don't matter. To them, children with disabilities in these poor communities don't matter. Children from immigrant families who are learning English don't matter. We've decided that it's okay for suburban schools in wealthy communities to have a better education for their children. That's not fair. [Brownstein]You go into a wealthy community. You won't see charter schools. Why don't they have charter schools? They don't need them. They're happy with their public schools. Why? Because they're well-funded. [woman] If you look at the way we fund schools in the United States, it is mostly through property taxes which means that where you live determines how much money is spent on your child's education. And it is designed to give advantages to people who already have advantages. No civilized country in the world does this. Uh, most societies spend the same amount per student in all of their schools. And so we have this enormous inequality that is getting worse. [Damon] Like Philadelphia, Union City, New Jersey is a poor urban community. [Kirp]In Union City, there are no vouchers or charter schools or anything of the sort. What they've done is to build a good urban public school system. The top students are going to all the Ivy League schools. They're winning national science competitions. You would assume that you were in some fancy suburban school district. There's that kind of positive energy, engagement, in what's happening in the schools. [Damon] In 2013-14, more than 80% of students were low-income and many were immigrants. Yet 94% of Union City graduates went on to college, far exceeding the national average. Okay, so today we're going to dissect a number of animals and we're going to not only look at the anatomy of each animal, but we're going to note how the animal or organism is specialized and adapted to survive in its environment. Once you find the mouth, then you count just that area right there, up to 25 around there... [boy]My parents emigrated from El Salvador. Usually at home, I speak Spanish. And I usually practice my English language when I come here in school. My goal is to become a doctor. I'll be attending Brown University through an eight-year medical program that they have. [Damon] In the 1980s, Union City had many of the same problems as Philadelphia. [Kirp]Back in the 80s, school buildings didn't get repaired, they were left pretty derelict, teachers were demoralized, student performance was so terrible that the state threatened to take over the district. They had to do something. [Damon] Instead of closing schools and turning them over to private managers, as so many troubled urban districts have done, in the early 90s, district leaders in Union City did a radical thing for the time. They made a commitment to strengthen their public schools. We were able to document all of our best practices in Union City. We started immediately to develop our own blueprint. And this allowed us to have one system, one way of doing things that everyone in our district can follow. [Damon] Union City benefited from court decisions, which ordered New Jersey to spend as much on educating children in its poorest cities, as in its wealthy suburbs. The courts also mandated that high quality preschool be offered to all the district's three and four-year olds. Two antennas And six crawly legs Head, thorax, abdomen What they did was to build a system of supports for kids from preschool through high school. Pretty basic stuff. There's nothing fancy going on here. Any educator with a pulse knows the value of the things that Union City did. They're proven game changers. What are we learning about this week? [kids] Bugs. Insects. -What specific bugs? -Ants and butterflies. Symmetrical ones. Can you please become an egg on a leaf? [girl] "Have you ever had an obstacle that made you a stronger person? I have. It was when I was acting in front of every fourth grade class." So what was it? It was a what type of a lead? - [students] A question. - OK, let's open our... [Damon] Union City educators decided to emphasize hands on, project-based learning, rather than teaching to the test. Nocturnal animals are animals that do what? Sleep in the day and... [Damon] Even so, students' scores on the state reading and math tests have consistently been among the best for urban districts in New Jersey. What do they do when they're awake in the night? They hunt... [Kirp]Teachers are a key part of the story. They are encouraged to collaborate, to work together, to share ideas, and the problems they have got. Mentors are working in classrooms. So it's a very warm, embracing, supportive system. [woman]I was a fourth-grader here in Washington School, amazingly. [speaking Spanish] I've been here teaching at Washington School for 31 and a half years. It's a very, very demanding school district. It's all I could say. It's... What's expected of the teachers is monumental. And the lucky ones are the students. [speaking Spanish] [man] Here in the high school, a lot of students struggle with some really difficult socio-economic issues and may have dropped out of school. So we provide some of the supports that they may not be getting outside, so that they can achieve success despite the challenges that they are facing. We have a daycare center right on site. We provide social workers and we have a clinic that's attached to the high school, which provides medical support. [Kirp]There are plenty of examples of good public schools that we don't hear about. But what's going on in public schools like Union City is proof that if you provide enough resources to a school district and you help that district use those resources wisely, you get astonishing results. You get these improbable and fantastic scholars. [Damon] With about $20,000 to spend per student, Union City educators could focus their attention on the real work of teaching and learning. You have a heart. Where's the heart? The heart is really small... up there. OK, good! [Damon] But in Philadelphia, the district was once again caught up in a funding crisis, as the end of the school year approached. [newswoman] School officials announced that the district will finish the current year with a $29 million deficit. And the outlook for next year is even worse. [chanting] - SOS! - Save our schools! Save our schools! Save our schools! Save our schools! Save our schools! Save our schools! [newswoman] Philadelphia principals converged on City Hall today to express their frustration with the prospect of more funding cuts. The budgets that we operate under now make it very difficult to create those environments that are necessary. We need both the city and the state to pass legislation so that we can support the children of Philadelphia. There aren't any gimmicks or quick fixes to solve our financial challenges. There's no fat or even flesh left to cut. We're now talking about amputations. We know that our principals, teachers, and support staff are holding things together with duct tape. What they're doing is not sustainable. Without a full-time nurse, who injects insulin three times a week into the arms of students with diabetes. The answer at my school is that I inject the insulin. Who provides them hearing and eye exams? The answer is no one. [newsman] There was no nurse on duty at Andrew Jackson School in Philadelphia today, when a seven-year-old boy collapsed. He was taken to Children's Hospital where he died. A nurse is scheduled at the school only on Thursdays and every other Friday. Would you send your child to a school that was bereft of counselors and nurses? That had no music and art? Where you can't guarantee them a desk that they can sit in? This is fundamentally a moral question: Is this really what you are calling education in America today? After cutting all that we cut a year ago, how is it possible that we are asked to cut anymore? I'm just imploring everyone to advocate with whomever you need to advocate with because this is serious. - And this is serious not just for us as district leaders... - [cheering] This is serious for the future of this city and for the education of our children. [newsman] In Harrisburg, it's a fight for full funding. Education activists announced today that they are staging a sit in. Activists plan to stay at the capitol until the governor signs a budget that restores a billion dollars in cuts to education statewide and distributes education money more fairly. [all chanting] [Damon] Governor Corbett, in the midst of a tough re-election campaign, came under fire for cutting education while refusing to raise taxes on the state's booming fracking industry. We are leaving $1 billion in the pockets of the largest, fastest-growing and rapaciously greedy natural gas industry and we leave our children out in the dark. This is not a money problem, this is a values issue. [Damon] Pennsylvania legislators left the capital for the summer, without allocating more funds for schools. Fifteen minutes, y'all! Fifteen minutes! Hot? I know it's hot. It's June in Philadelphia, it's supposed to be hot. [woman] Ander McCullum... Marcel Luhur... [crowd cheering] Jamie Cruz... Henry Pierre Louis... You've come a long way. Good work. [woman] Michael Riley... [cheering] I am the proud principal of South Philadelphia High School. I hereby declare you the graduating class of 2014. [cheering] Yeah! [Pierre Louis] I came a long way but I'm finally here. I finally made it. She gonna know her mommy graduated high school. I feel sad, excited, happy, overwhelmed all in the same time. Making my parents happy is my duty. And that's why I'm planning to go to college and get a Master degree. Mike's made us proud, just, the whole year. His whole... I'm not going to cry anymore. It couldn't be a bigger day for us. Simple as that. I have decided that I want to become a teacher. I feel as though I can help a lot of kids. I definitely feel that I can make a difference. It was a tough year. I knew we would finish. It was just how. And I felt like we finished pretty strong considering the lack of resources. So we're gonna have to still keep that fight going. [Damon] Three months later, state lawmakers finally approved a cigarette tax for Philadelphia. It helped the district avoid another round of layoffs. But it did little to improve the dire conditions in the city's public schools. That fall, civil rights attorneys took the state to court to demand equal funding for students in Pennsylvania's poorest school districts. [Brownstein] We consider public education to be the civil rights issue of our day because it's a matter of justice. Under every state's constitution in the United States, there is actually a guarantee of both an adequate and equitable education, and that all children be treated equally. I hope that people from other states are thinking about pressuring their lawmakers to provide additional resources for these poor districts. New Jersey's public schools now have the narrowest achievement gap in the country. That says something about the value of resources targeted on poor kids, the kids that need it the most. [Damon] In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Corbett's education policies had met with fierce opposition from public school teachers, parents and students. Now, they led the fight to defeat him. [newsman]Pennsylvania Democratic businessman, Tom Wolf, has unseated the state's Republican governor, Tom Corbett. Wolf hammered the governor over declining education spending. Our state will never be as strong as it needs to be if some schools have all the resources they need while other schools are cutting band and football, just to keep the lights on. If we lose public education completely, we're gonna see a further widening of the income gap in this country. You will begin to see even more poor people and super rich people. Privatized public education is not the great equalizer. [Hackney]When people remain in that vicious cycle of poverty, how do they really become contributing and productive citizens? So, I mean, it all comes down to citizenship. If you want to have a stronger country, then you create stronger citizens. To do that, you create stronger public schools. [Gym]Public schools can be places of hope. They can be places of humanity. And to make sure that that happens for every child, no matter what language they speak, no matter what race, no matter what class, um, and what neighborhood they live in, this is our central task. It's our challenge. And we have to rise to that. [chanting] Betsy DeVos has got to go! Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Betsy DeVos has got to go! Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Betsy DeVos has got to go! Hey, hey! [chanting] Public schools are not for sale! Public schools are not for sale! Public schools are not for sale! [all] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And to the Republic for which it stands. One nation... [yelling and chanting] [newsman] Students, teachers and parents just started marching through the streets. They don't support the nomination for Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos. [chanting] This is what democracy looks like! Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like! Show me what democracy looks like!" This is what democracy looks like!
