HIROYUKI OKITA SAKAE UMEZU ATSUKO TAKANO JUNKO ASAHINA Production by KOJI ABE Written by SHINTARO MIYAWAKI and KEIKO AIZAKI Script by JUN FURUSHO Produced by TOMOYUKI IMAI and TAKEHIRO KIKUCHI Directed by TAKAO NAGAISHI Thank you for the gift. Okay. Yayoi... Yayoi... What are you doing? But... We've been dating for six months. I thought maybe we could... Who said we're dating? Have you ever looked at your face in the mirror? Are you joking? You should feel honored just to drive me home. I'll get a ride from someone else next time. But... Never call me again. Yayoi... But I'll keep the gift. Bye bye. If I'd known it would be like this, I would've never left the farm. I sold my cow for this, please forgive me. Hello. Hiroshi... No, I didn't. I couldn't. I'm not lying to you. Yes, I don't know what people say about me but I'm very faithful. Hello? Hello? Yayoi? I have a gift, from the list of guys you bankrupted. Yayoi? Yayoi? What's going on there? This is just a taste of the anger felt for you. It's time for repentance. Do you understand? You must understand how they felt. Answer me, Yayoi, what's going on? More. Hello, Yayoi? Can you hear me? - Good morning, teacher. - Morning. Happy birthday. Did you forget your own birthday? Here's a gift from us. Yes, a hanky. Thank you. I never imagined you girls were so sweet. It's very nice. What is this? Red Cross, Red Cross. You're going to be late. Hurry. Yes. Does Red Cross give purple feathers with donations? I don't know. Here is Shin Kaneko, candidate for the Senate House. Teacher, panties? Wait a minute. Tomoko Kayama is the wife of the candidate for Senator... Takashi Kayama? Yes. A politician's wife? Why won't you accept? I'm not saying for sure. But when a politician is involved, it's always much more complicated. Small guys like me always take it up their ass. Please, won't you reconsider? Well, anyway, I'll listen to your reasons. Takashi Kayama and I were dating seriously. I was so happy. But when he decided to run for office... His secretary, Tomoko, told me to stop seeing him during the campaign. She convinced me that a scandal could be fatal to him, because of the nightclub. But I've never done anything unethical. If my occupation could hurt his political aspirations... I promised her, I wouldn't see him during the campaign. However... After several months, I heard they became engaged. So secretary Tomoko and candidate Kayama... Yes. Please, let me ask, only once. Only once. Let her feel my pain. Please. Please help me. Uncle, I feel uncomfortable about taking up this case. Do you think somethings fishy? I'm not saying that but something seems wrong. The girl offered us $4.000 for our service, and she only manages a Ginza nightclub. But she was crying in front of me. Her tears are worth $4.000. Avenging Tomoko is worth it to her. But I don't know. Rapeman represents justice: Vengeance when the law is powerless. You're right, I'll do it. Thank you. That's my Keisuke. With this $4.000, we've reached our goal. $10.000. Sunflower Orphanage Fund. Now we have the money needed to keep the place. That's right. Keisuke. How long were you in Sunflower Orphanage? I lost my parents when I was five, so maybe thirteen years. Thirteen years. I've known the director for forty years. Forty years? When you met her, she must have been beautiful. Yes, she was pretty! Pretty! That's Kayama's campaign van. This is a gift from a girl who's lover was stolen by you. Hey, watch where you're going! - Uncle? - What's wrong? They took photos of me. - Is that the car? - Maybe. Thank you very much for your job. Ms., you're really beautiful. You'll meet someone better than Takashi Kayama. I hope so. You never know, happiness could be right around the corner. Madam, sometime I'll stop by the Ginza club and say hello. - Yes. Please do. - Yes. - I'll be waiting. - Yes, yes. Excuse me. This way. Say, may I help you? Have any apartments? Yes, I have one available. Do you have something under $500, four rooms. Are you kidding? If such a thing existed I'd buy it right away. - Is that true? - Yes. I'll check somewhere else. Yes. Yes. I should put a sign: "Serious tenants only" Uncle! Who was the lady that just left? A crazy woman. She was taking photos of you from over there. What? I think it's the same person who took the photos of me. What? That's no good. No good at all. That's terrible. We need to get those photos. Chief editor, I understand, but I'm not fooling around. I understand, I understand. Please give me a chance. Don't fire me, I'm on a big scoop. I promise. Yes. Yes, I'll fax it right away. Yes. Yes. Listen, if you do what I say, I won't hurt you. Will you cooperate? I'm only here for the photos and negatives. What? What photos? Don't play around. I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, I understand. I need to give you a taste of my profession. Look. See on the roof? If you don't give me the photos and negatives, we're sending your rape scene to every media center. Are you prepared for that? Wait, I'll give them to you. Please don't touch me. Where are they? Over there, in the drawer. Is this the one? If it's the wrong one, you know what happens next. These aren't the rape photos. Keisuke. These pictures are still very interesting. The top Yakuza officials from Kyokuryu-kai. This is the boss and a gang leader. And that's the madam. Kyokuryu company. Thank you for coming. It's always good to see you. We will have a bright future. Excuse me. Here. Let's help each other, shall we? Of course, it'll be good for both of us. Numata, is everything all right with you? Certainly, sir. How about the police investigation on trafficking? - Have you heard from them? - No, not recently. When I say I'll stop them, I'll really stop them. Or, are you saying you don't trust me? No, I didn't mean to insult you. Be careful of the words you use. Ms. Numata, forgive him. He meant no insult. I'm terribly sorry. Ms. Numata is a true woman, even I respect her. She is most capable. Yes, certainly. She's very sharp. Initially I wasn't expecting much from her but I've been pleasantly impressed. She's too professional to be a woman. That's right. Sir... Excuse me. I told you, if you'd give me the wrong photos, I'd be back. That's all I have. You can do whatever you want to me, it's not going to help. Sooner or later, the police will eventually stop Kyokuryu Yakuza. I'm not from Kyokuryu. What? I only want the rape photos from you. Rape Photos? What are you talking about? You really don't know? So you don't know. Let me ask only one question. What do you know about the lady in this photo and Kyokuryu? She's the madam at a Ginza nightclub, and Kyokuryu Company owns it. That's it? A slight misunderstanding. I'm sorry. Forget I was here. Oh, my favorite realtor. Madam. Welcome. I just stopped by to say hello. How nice. Come this way. - Watch your step. - All right. What would you like to drink? Let's see... I'll start with a beer. Yes. Ms. Akemi, bring us a beer. Right away, madam. Thank you again for a job well done. I feel so much better now. Really? Very nice. - Madam... - Yes? To be honest, something unfortunate happened to us. That is? While raping Tomoko, someone else took photos. Who would've done that? We have a suspect in mind. But I'd rather not mention a name right now. We're investigating and we retrieved the photos. Do you know who else showed up in another photo? Who? A Kyokuryu boss and a gang leader. And you, madam. What? Madam, are you sure there's no relationship between the candidate's wife and the Kyokuryu? Yes, I'm sure. Don't worry, we're investigating it. Thank you for waiting. Excuse me for a moment. Akemi, please take care of him. Yes. You're pretty. Welcome to the club. How old are you? How old do I look? Based on this lovely thigh, I'd say nineteen years old. You... Are you kidding? Let me kiss your cheek. It's me. Something unfortunate has happened dealing with the situation. Yes. What's wrong? It's not nice to watch somebody pissing. If you want to live longer, quit sniffing around. What are you doing to me? Uncle! Keisuke. It's terrible, you don't deserve something like this. There's something they'd rather keep hidden. Her sad pitiful story was all fake. The car escaping from the rape scene was involved. They took the photos for some reason. Think about it. The madam told us when to do it and where. She told us when to go to the garage to attack Tomoko. The madam played a trick on us. Keisuke... I want to walk away from this case. We can't just forget about it. I understand your feelings. Uncle... Uncle, Rapeman's motto is: "Righting wrongs through penetration" Uncle, we have a responsibility to uphold. Think about the children at the Sunflower Orphanage. We can't donate dirty money from gangsters. Do you think it's all right? Do you think that will make those kids happy? I really don't want to walk away from this case. I remember you said it smelled fishy. You were doubtful about the madam's story. I'm sorry I was blinded by her tears. If we stick our noses into this case, Keisuke, we'll find ourselves in some big trouble. I'm also responsible for your safety. I couldn't face Lady Sunflower if anything happened. Uncle... Keisuke... We should close Rapeman Services for a while. Welcome. Welcome to the club. Are you alone? Yes. Follow me, please. What would you like to drink? Water and liquor. Whiskey's all right? Yes. Is this your first time to come here? Yes. I'm Akemi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Go ahead. That was amazing. You should buy a bottle if you drink like that. It's much cheaper. - Yes, I'd like to do that. - Thank you very much. I can't drink anymore. Maybe a kiss can rejuvenate you. I'm rejuvenated! Can I drink with you? Everybody, have whatever you want. Bring another bottle. I need to take a piss. - Are you all right? - Are you okay? I can piss by myself. Here's the bottle. Start drinking! Be careful. Who took the rape photos? I don't know. Is that so? I'm going to ask one more time. Who took the photos? I don't know. Who was it? I was simply asked to set up the rape. Who asked you to do it? That's... Kyokuryu asked you, right? I don't know anything. Why did they target the candidate's wife? I don't know. I don't know anything. I'm giving you a special gift for tricking us. You don't know what you're doing. Kyokuryu will move against you. Are you all right? I don't think so. I better go home. All right, but come back soon. Are you okay? I can't stop the hiccups. Sometimes a shock can stop them. See? Your hiccups stopped. Is this a joke? That was great. - Good morning, teacher. - Hello. You smell like alcohol. Please don't talk loud. Teacher, wait. Maybe we should cancel the class. Wait... Stop talking at the same time. Maybe you should take this.. You can't bribe me with chewing gum. Candidate's wife in unsuccessful suicide. I'm sorry. Excuse me. - The class is canceled. - Really? Teacher, my bag! - Drive carefully. - See you later. Class is canceled! I didn't do anything. What did I do? Bitch, you have a big mouth! We made your dream come true. You became a Ginza manager in your twenties. But that's all over. All over? What does that mean? Hello, Ms. Numata. Have you seen the newspaper? Sure, we didn't expect that result. But it's no problem. Do you still think our plan is safe? We guarantee it. Candidate Kayama isn't stupid enough to expose his wife's shame. If you say so. But aren't there some other loose ends? Do you think I'm a loose end? I heard Rapeman showed up at your place. Yes. But I didn't talk. Really? Ms. Numata, don't worry about this. I'm going to kill everybody involved in this mess. For starters, that one. You can't. I'll do whatever you want. Please don't kill me. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle! Uncle! Could it be? You don't know what you're doing. Kyokuryu will move against you. Here he is. Who is this old man? He's the contact for Rapeman. What are you trying to do to me? What do you want me to do? How about letting me go. Who is Rapeman? I don't know. Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. What a goofball you are. If you don't want to tell me, that's all right. But you'll end up floating in the Pacific Ocean along with the madam. Who are you? I'm from the gas company. It's just a routine check. There's been many gas leaks recently in this neighborhood. - May I come in, please? - OK but hurry. Yes, thank you. Who the hell are you? - Excuse me. - He's with the gas company. He needs to check the unit in the corner. We're having a serious conversation here. Of course, sir. But I need to take a look at it, I have my orders. What kind of civil servant is this? You're taking too long. I'm sorry, everything is all right here. I'll be going now. What an idiot. I better get going. Please, give my regards to your boss. You're no good. - My turn. - No, my turn next. Hey, Gas Man. What are you doing here? Nothing's over there. I need to pee so bad. I'm looking for the bathroom. It's right around the corner. Do it quickly. Fool. What's that smoke? Gas is leaking! It's going to explode. An explosion? Boss! Quickly! Quickly! Get out of here. Uncle! Uncle! Are you okay? Keisuke, I thought I was done for. I don't think it's going to explode. The old man is on the roof. If he's found, we'll be in trouble. You're right. Go! Move it. This way. Come on, hurry. Hurry up. I can't run anymore. Don't say that. Stop! Wait! Get in. Shit! Uncle, don't get up. I still wonder, why were you guys being chased by Kyokuryu. You're a high school teacher and you're just a realtor. Well... Sir, here's your water. I can't imagine you guys are involved in drug trafficking. I'm a professional educator, I wouldn't be involved in drugs. Perhaps you've been nibbling on the boss's wife? Absolutely not. So what's the reason? I think you owe me that much. I saved your life. News report from candidate Takashi Kayama's home. He has just announced his decision to drop from the race, due to the scandal surrounding his wife's attempted suicide. Here is Kayama's car. Mr. Kayama, please give us a comment. Did you really drop out of the race? Yes, I'm very sorry for the people who always supported me. What is the reason for your wife's attempted suicide? She's been upset due to pressures, a certain amount of mental stress. What? Was I used by the Kyokuryu to make this man drop out? If that's true, this is a great scoop. It's my first big scoop. Listen, do you really think Kyokuryu was behind the dropout? Let's say it's true. But what is your involvement? I need to do it for myself, and for Uncle... And for... That's the car! That car belongs to Yabuki, one of the gang leaders. Why is it important? Nothing. That's the dragon lady Uncle was talking about. She's not part of he Kyokuryu. She looks familiar to me. Look how the gang members are bowing to her. She must be very important, perhaps Jinno's woman. Yeah. - I remember... - What? She is Kaneko's secretary. Who is Kaneko? You know, Kaneko was running against Kayama. That explains a lot. What do you mean? Tell me what you know. Kaneko was running against Kayama in the election. That's right. So? Do you think... In this district, three people hold government positions. Two are committed to the ruling parties. But the third is independent and therefore the most inﬂuential. So with Kayama out of the race, Kaneko takes over. I think I'm beginning to understand. This is getting exciting. Where are you going? No place. Just stretching. Here they are. They're mine. You son of a bitch, you'll see. Numata? Mr. Jinno, what are you doing here? Sir, what do you mean? You called for me to come here. What? I don't remember doing that. But I got the message from Numata. Numata? What's going on? I don't know either. I had a message from Numata too she told me to come here. But Numata isn't here. Yes? Is that you, Numata? What's going on here? Sir, what are you doing there so late at night? You told us to come here. I didn't do anything like that. I've been looking for you. So you say you don't know anything about this? Yes. - I'll talk to you later. - Yes. What is going on here? I don't know. This smells like a trap. If the media gets a photo of us, they'll start piecing this political puzzle together. My career would be over. Big trouble. Please, go home. I'm leaving. Excuse me. Be careful. I was hoping to break this story right away. We must keep quiet for a while, and use our information to frame Numata and the Kyokuryu. That will be the best story for you. You think so? Will I get a Pulitzer Prize? Maybe. I'll do my best. Excuse me, sir. You need to leave for the downtown headquarters. Can I leave after the ceremony? That'll be all right. Are you ready for the festivities? We'll be ready soon. Shin Kaneko is declared the winner. Let's go. Shin Kaneko, in a landslide, is declared the winner. He is the new representative filling the independent seat in Tokyo's 17th District. Congratulations! Good job. Congratulations! Thank you. Congratulations, sir. How are you feeling right now? To the people who supported me. To those who sent me to the House of Representatives and to the entire nation. I promise from the bottom of my soul, a program of complete political reform. I will devote my heart to the people of Japan. This I swear. Ms. Numata, excuse me, there's a phone call for you. You can use the booth next door. Thank you. Do you intend to run for Prime Minister office? It's too early to say. But if the citizens wants me to represent them, I will take the responsibility and take it very seriously. Hello, this is Numata. Hello? Hello? Nobody there. Are there any other questions? Is it true you have dealings with Kyokuryu Yakuza? I know nothing of that. Nothing could be further from the truth. So you're saying you never met with them? Of course I've never met them. Is that so? Then who was the man you met here, three nights ago? Three nights ago? You set it up! Please explain yourself. Do you believe this woman? During the campaign, I never saw anyone except my staff. What newspaper do you represent? Are you an editor? You've insulted me! I'm... Sir, are you ready? Time for the ceremony. I almost forgot. Now it's time for the ultimate celebration for Senator Shin Kaneko. Everybody, get ready. Does everyone have their cameras ready? What is this? What are these? What are these photos? You made a big mistake when you pissed me off. This is a gift from the old man you almost killed. Can you feel the anger of Senator Kayama and his poor wife? - Can you explain these photos? - Who is this? Is this man in the photo Kozo Jinno, the Yakuza boss? I don't know. This is a setup, I'm innocent. She's trying to ruin my career as a politician. - What's going on? - I don't know. This smells like a trap. If the media gets a photo of us, they'll start piecing this political puzzle together. My career would be over. Shit, I don't know. I have never dealt with Kyokuryu Yakuza. My secretary can clear this up. Numata! Numata, where are you? My boss, Kaneko and the Kyokuryu boss have been friends for several years. He forced me to use the Kyokuryu to create the Kayama scandal. Mr. Kaneko, sir, is that Secretary Numata's voice? Is it true? Did you mastermind the Kayama scandal? Mr. Kaneko? Please answer. Just one word, sir. Mr. Kaneko. - Mr. Kaneko. - Senator. - Give us a comment. - Please. What is that? I don't know, perhaps the lines are crossed. Emergency! Emergency! Kaneko has fainted. That's it, Kaneko's career is over. What is that? I can't trust politicians any more. Bribes and embezzlements are up in the business world. It's child's play compared to what the politicians are doing. Can things change with new elected officials? Sooner or later, maybe we can replace the bad politicians. - It's very sad. - Yes, indeed. That's why we're here. Keep your penis strong. Anonymous donation to Sunflower Orphanage, an envelope containing $10000 was found in their mailbox. The letter simply said: "Please use this money for the children." The orphanage was saved once again from foreclosure. Congratulations. Now it's time for the news. We're at Kyokuryu Offices in Minato-ku. Here comes Kozo Jinno, the notorious Yakuza boss. Following him is the gang leader Enoki, accompanied by the police. And now we see a number of other Yakuza officials. Jinno's face is noticeably pale. Look. Junko's on the news. She's doing a really good job. Good afternoon. - May I ask you something? - Yes, of course, anything. I heard this is the place where I can arrange for a rape. What are you talking about? This is it. It's called Rapeman Services. Depending on your request, we might fulfill it. You need to have a good reason. Can we help you? Are you saying you're Rapeman? No. At my age, you can't expect more than three pumps. I would think so. So then, who is Rapeman? Come on, tell me. Wait. That's top secret information in this company. I see. I'd like to use the service. Is that true? Thank you. Who is the rape target? Me. Translation and subtitles by YUKO MIHARA and THOMAS WEISSER.
