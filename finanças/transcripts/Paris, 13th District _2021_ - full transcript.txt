Want a yogurt? No, but some water please. What do you sell your clients? Phone and data plans... Tons of shit they don't care about. Does it work? You mean in general? No. Are you a good saleswoman? I'm irresistible. You don't say? Don't believe me? Hello, Mr. Garnier. Good evening. This is Maryline Dumont. I'll calling today to review your unlimited data plan. Not really unlimited, because it'll cost you a fortune when you call your wife from abroad. Or when you look for too long at kooky cat videos on your phone.

WRAP WELL ًWITH CLING FILM Hello, Mr. Dufranc, I'm Maryline Dumont, your IntelCall representative, calling... Yes, Mom. What's going on? What's wrong? You sound depressed - It's my voice. - I've forgotten it. A whole week without calling! It's been 3 days. You must visit your grandmother. She's not doing well. She asks for you. Okay, I'll go. As soon as I can. How's London? Fine. Your sister's twins are a lot of work. Your father 's tired. - Your sister... - I'm in the elevator. The call's gonna drop... Fuck! Good evening. Yes? It's for the ad for the room. Yes? Are you Emilie? Yes. Bad timing? Sorry, you're mistaken. Why? "Camille" texted. My name is Camille. I want a girl. You didn't say. That's how it is. I teach at Fernand Leger high school in Ivry. This location's ideal. I work days, go out nights. What a pity! Hi, Emilie! Hi! Fucking tonight? Whatever. He's nice and tall. What? - So long. - So long. How do you become a teacher? Get a master's or a doctorate. I know, but what led you there? Was it by passion or by default? Passion. Now I'm stopping to get my doctorate. What do you do? Call center operator. No college? Sciences Po. Call center, Sciences Po. You're funny. My parents aren't laughing. Can I ask a question? Roommate Q&A? What's your love life like? I channel professional frustration into intense sexual activity. Cool. Nothing noisy or invasive for a roommate. I promise. How about you? Fuck first, see later. Elaborate. It's a Chinese proverb. Rough translation: I was furious not to have shoes, so I met a man with no feet and I feel better. Chinese is concise. It depends. - Bullshitting me? - No, why? I think you're talking total crap. No, I swear. Wonderful. See you Friday. What's this? It's to lose weight. Is it Japanese? Dunno... I'll take it off. No, it turns me on. You should upgrade. 40 gigas for a total of 49.90.

AS IF YOU'RE WEARING NOTHING You're starting to fall in love. No, not at all. You're so not my type. Yeah, I can tell. You're falling in love. Too much pleasure. You're right, I'll watch out. You can't do this to me. Goodnight. Where you going? It's your room. Out of my bed. Fuck! Are you crazy? - What? - That hurt! Switch off the light, please. Who is it? Yes? Actually, I was... in the room next door, reading Rousseau's Confessions, and I was wondering if you wanted some yogurt? Last week, I shipped raw meat to a guy whose voice annoyed me. - Are you kidding? - I swear. I want to blow you. What? I want to go home. What time do you work? 8 o'clock. I'm meeting my replacement. How are your sophomores? They're weak. Did you do writing assessments? Their handwriting's okay. Their spelling's lousy. Reading too. Zero comprehension skills. So why plunge into 16th-century travel writing? As a way of examining the religious wars. To show religion pre-existed them. Antoine, move it! That tolerance is... Stop inspecting me with that stare! No, I'm... I'm impressed. Sounds great. Speaking to common folk, often entails imitating the way common folk are supposed to think and talk. Speaking to common folk is to direct them. This is why the subject cannot be... Yeah? It's me. Not tonight. Hey. Can I ask something? Sure. When you said "not tonight", what did you mean? It means "not tonight". So will tonight be okay? Or else tomorrow or Friday the 12th? Is that okay? You want to make a calendar? We'll put it on the fridge. So, what days? How about tonight? - Any plans? - Listen, those nights were great. We have fun but we're not a couple. We're roommates. I don't want to be in a couple with anyone, so... Meaning? It's easier if we don't fuck nonstop, or not regularly? Or not at all? There you have it. That's it? What else is there? I don't know, you... You'd rather I ask you to leave? Only if it bothers you. It doesn't bother me. But we need to make new rules. We share cleaning, food, and stop walking around naked. Miss Wang, please? Wong. Yes, ma'am. What don't you like about your plan? I always go over on my cell phone data plan.

Pleek and Pluck! Do you realize how you sounded? Pleek and Pluck. Are you crazy? And last week, you gave a customer weight-loss tips. I'm on duty. What's wrong? Roommate issues. This is about roommate issues? Wait, do I tell them to stop surgery because my sister roommate's issues? You kidding? There's more. I got fired! Shit job anyway. I gotta run, talk tonight. Wait, wait. You say I have relational issues, that it stunts my growth. Can you explain? I don't know anymore. Shit! Now is not the time! Please! You're immature, egocentric, selfish... That's dead wrong! No, it's not. Read the book I sent? The big one? What's it called? "Stunted in Relations". Read it! Why stuff my head with 200 pages to know how I already act at home? Emilie? Emilie? Emilie? Can't you knock first? I called you 4 times. I didn't hear. What are you up to? - You didn't get up all day? - No. You did nothing? Yes, I watched TV, I pigged out, and I watched TV. Did you call for that job? I tried. It's no good. What you doing tonight? Why? I asked friends to dinner. Teachers, right? Yes, teachers. It would be nice if we could have the apartment to ourselves. Ah, and... will you need my room too? No, of course not. Fine, I'll leave you the rest of it. My rent's on the kitchen table. "Mom" "Go see your grandmother." Emilie! - You good? - Yeah, you? Nice seeing your kisser. You're wasted. Want some? I love this. My Camille. Camille, honey! I'm coming, Camille. I'm flying! I'm coming, Camille! You're so hot. Is this a joke? Who is she? Yeah, who's she? Stephanie, Emilie... Stephanie's a colleague, Emilie's my roommate. Ah, ok. So, she's the roommate. - Coming? - I'm coming. - Don't linger. - I said I'm coming. I thought you'd be back later. So did I. Did you take something? Ecstasy. Don't you want to tell him to come? We can have a threesome. Sure, that's totally her style. She's the one taking over my classes for me. What a pity. I'd have loved that. Here. Cover up, you'll catch your death. My death? No, not death. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'm having a bad trip. I'm having a bad trip. From what? I took something, I feel sick. What did you take? How much? How long ago? Just some ecstasy. You fucking scared me. Take half a Valium and try to sleep. I can't. I hear them fucking. It's unbearable. Who do you hear fucking? My roommate! Your roommate? Yes, Camille and that whore. You've totally lost it. Every time you call me now it's about your roommate? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Stop calling me! - If you call, I won't answer. - I'm sorry. Fuck this! I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - How are you? - And you, son? - Am I early? - Early for what? Eponine, your brother's here! - Are you telling him? - No... You. She does stand-up. Cool, right? I saw her on stage, and frankly, it's not bad. Not bad? Y-you were cracking up! It was hilarious. You were amazing. What do you think? About stand-up? Wh-why "stand up pffff"? I'm sure you're good, but it's not my thing. - Can you elaborate? - Yes, I can. I hate smug, self-styled comics, their pretentiousness to make people laugh at inane bullshit, the tyranny of meta-irony. Th-thanks for b-being so encouraging. You asked, I answered. Answer differently. You spout such crap! Don't tire yourself, Dad. You're becoming arrogant. A young fuddy-duddy. Bad path for a teacher. Exactly, old f-fart! - Epo! - Eponine! She's sixteen, Camille. Sixteen! Ask my opinion and I give it. Fuck your opinion! Your sister's 16. Don't say what you think. Save it and tell her what she wants to hear. Show interest, encouragement. We don't care what you really think. No one gives a fuck. And I'll tell you something. She doesn't stutter on stage. - Epo, it's me. - Fuck off, a-asshole! Her belongings are in here. Epo took some stuff. Help yourself to the rest. It's all being hauled away next week. I still have her chair. I can't fold it. Try to find me a buyer. I'll deal with it, Dad. Yes! What about Dad? Is he happy? Stephanie? Yes? Can we talk for a sec? Hello. - How are you? - Good, you? What I have to say isn't easy. - Go on. - ًWant some tea? Yes, thanks. Where's Camille? Family lunch. He'll be back by 3. And you're here? Yeah. Find that normal? Meaning? With him, you're at our place. Without him, you're at mine. Yeah. Thanks. Either way, it's never your place. Yeah. No, what do you mean? You should pay rent. - Are you serious? - Yes. You can pay per night, just keep track. The other girl pays 12 euros. She's usually here two nights a week. What other girl? Mathilde, the country girl, comes Tuesday and Thursday. - Except when you're here, of course. - Yeah. - You done? - Yes. Never speak to me again. - Come on, LOL! - Never! It was a joke! It took me a week to fix your mess. What mess? Mathilde, the country girl? Come on, she's humorless, like I said. - And you're a laugh riot. - Yeah! You're not funny, not crazy, just obnoxious. Because you find her cool? - She's mean to you. - It's my problem. And she talks out of her ass. Weird, how you find people stupid. You'll end up cutting yourself off. I could meet the sweetest, the smartest girl, the quickest, whatever, if I'm not violently turned on, forget it. Attraction fades, so start with the highest attraction level. It takes longer to fade. The highest attraction level? How long did we fuck? I don't know. Two weeks? I'm moving in with her. For a few days? For good. Fuck, Camille. I'm out of work and broke! You can't! Take the opportunity to move, to find something smaller. - I can't move out! - Why not? It's my grandmother's. It's your grandmother's place? Why didn't you ever tell me? You never asked. What's the difference? You pay rent? No. That's the difference. I'm your unearned income. I pay to live with you and bear you. Gross of you to say that! Stephanie or not, I'd have left. What did I do to you? When we decided to stop having sex... I decided nothing. When I decided, you laid down new laws. And none of it was: Sex partners are not allowed. Otherwise, I'd have left. What are you talking about? I thought we were talking about Stephanie. I'm talking about Stephanie. Stop, stop. Stop what? - With your bullshit. - What bullshit? You're in love. I'm not. This can't go on. What are you saying? I left the rent and the key. You'll miss me. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you, Baptiste, Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, Baptiste. My name is Amber Sweet and I'm your birthday surprise. So, we have... half an hour, Baptiste. Half an hour of hot chatting, very hot chatting, very, very, very hot. Your buddies gave me some naughty tips, especially for Baptiste. But you know what? I'll start by playing with myself. And once I'm wet, we'll do something else. Come on, let's do it, Baptiste! Let's go! It's really nice. I have all the shops I need. Chinese restaurants galore. It's like a village. University is 10 minutes by foot. Life's great. I couldn't have found better. Know what? I see the Seine from my window. Wait, I'll show you. I'm super excited, I want to scream! Some tiles fell off. It's black, there's mold. The owner wants me to take care of it myself. Yeah, a month without rent if I have the receipts. If I do the work, can you make me receipts? I'll send the pics. WELCOME TO PARIS 1 PANTHÉON-SORBONNE UNIVERSITY Hey. - Hi. - I'm Nora. Leila. Pleasure. Is it always so packed? Welcome to Tolbiac! Where are you from? Bordeaux. Why?

Your annual turnover? How many sales a month? Two, three? Maybe more? Maybe less. Maybe less. In fact, the agency belongs to a friend that I'm helping. It used to do well, but hasn't for two years, so he asked me to hire a sales agent. Do you know anything about real estate? Nothing. - Does it interest you? - Nope. Now I see why you're hiring!

They really wanted to hurt someone. You showed the cops the messages? No. What would it have done? To give them a scare! I have a file this big. "I hope you catch AIDS, dirty whore." "I'm gonna cut your tits off." You accept it? No. If I catch one of them, he better cover his balls. Where do you live? Want my social too? Listen, Nora, I like you, but... ADD TOKENS we're not BFFs.

I manage a friend's real-estate agency. What about your doctorate? I'm doing it, but I need money. I got sick of my tiny studio. How are things with Stephanie? - She dumped me. - Are you sad? No You don't care. I care, but I'm not sad. As sentimental as ever! So, what's life without Stephanie? With the agency and my doctorate, I'm on sexual sabbatical. Sexual sabbatical. Why did you call me today? To talk about suits and Steph I called because I missed you. You missed me? I thought you hated me. I'm the kind of girl guys miss? The kind of girl I missed. I missed you a lot. How's that? I missed you too. But not that much. Just at specific times of day. You know Eighty? - What's that? - A dating app. An app? An application, don't act so dumb. What do you think? As a means of socializing? No, for banging. "Banging"? You say "banging" now? Yeah. What do you think? Great way to get humiliated. I read an enlightening article. Really? You're on a dating app? Yes. - What? - That really... it really depresses me. What kind of dates did you go on? Excellent dates. - What kind? - All kinds. I'm open to everything. You've changed.

Go ahead. Wicked good! It's not really rap. Very good lyrics. Why did you stop? Officially, I took a year off to work on my doctorate in Modern Literature. Truth is, I left out of discouragement. Because of your students? Were you in a problem school? No, I liked the kids and I like teaching. It was the work conditions. Deplorable reforms every 6 months. We're underpaid, scorned, surveilled, muzzled. And our students end up in construction sites or selling gyros. Gratifying, isn't it? After your doctorate, will you teach? Yeah, but differently. Why are you laughing? - I want to do something dumb. - Really? Help me. Say something with "Camille". I don't get it. Like that: "Camille, I don't get it." - "Camille, I don't get it." - "Camille"?

Not at all. ...by the "Bardot myth," a mix of certain of your film roles and the enormous amount of press, for the most part, purely speculative, and published the world over, depicting you as something of a dumb blonde. Just look at you. They don't even do your hair. Why don't you answer? Look. Remember when we took that picture? The carriage. Yes. The carriage. Your hair is too long. You want me to cut it, Grandma? The carriage. The carriage. Go round and round... I'm in pain. I'm afraid. Remember what you told me as a kid? "When you're afraid," "think of someone you love" "and the pain will go away." Are you okay, Grandma? Who are you? What are you doing here? This is the kitchen we share. We have lots of closets. One there too. And here's... - the bathroom. - Okay. Wow, it's big. - It looks like Shanghai. - Really? It's pretty. I like it. I do have a favor to ask of you. It's unusual. Okay, what is it? My grandma is in an old-age home nearby, rue Victor Marchan. I'd like you to visit her once a week. How? Pretend you're me. She has Alzheimer's. She doesn't recognize anyone, including me. I'll lower your rent. Okay. - I'll do it. - Really? Thank you. Thank you so much. The work and text relationship is etiological. In other words, in some way, more or less directly, the text engenders the work, a mental image. For the creator, the mental image precedes the work.... Then the text is ready to be received.

Calling you pretty? Sounds like you struck gold. Why are you so unsure of yourself? You're sweet. You're gentle. You didn't answer my question. I want to tell you something. Tell me. Thanks, Camille. Just thanks. Why thanks? Thanks, that's all. She drives me crazy, totally crazy. She fills my head. All I think about. This all sounds familiar. What? "The high attraction level". It's more than that. She's a saint...I swear. I'll introduce you. There's something pure about her. She's serious, hardworking. A real pain. And a sucker if she thinks you're nice.

I began on the Junior French team at 18, then I got hurt and started at my uncle's agency. That's him. Did you sleep with him? Yeah. It shows that much? For 10 years. With your uncle? Yes. By marriage. Show me again. You're pretty. Hello, everyone. Hello. I'm Emilie. Nora. Camille's told me lots about you. Me too. Mr. Lim Tchoq, This is my friend Emily Wong. - Hello. - Hello. - Maybe we should introduce ourselves? - Go on. - You're Mr. Lim Tchoq? - Yes. I'm Emilie Wong, I'll be your interpreter. Thanks for coming. I hear you're just back from vacation. How was it? Fine. Can we hurry? I have a plane to catch. Taiwan? How do you know? Your accent. My family's Taiwanese. I wish I'd been born there. I love Taiwan. Grandma took me to Feicueiwan beach. So beautiful. I never wanted to leave. - Crescent Beach? - Yes. All that white sand... - Emilie, shall we? - Sorry. Yes, Mr. Lim Tchoq made an offer on an apartment Avenue Rene Coty. Initial each page of the inventory. We did the walk-through. The expenses, maintenance fees. Same for the cadastral plan, initial both pages. Details of costs for the past three months. Initial it as well. Want me to introduce you to my ex-colleagues? - Hey, guys! - Do you have the keys? The interpreter's leaving! Wait, wait. My pal Antoine is having a dinner. Want to come? A National Education dinner, your favorite. In that case... Come, close me to me Come close me Come touch my fingertips - "Fingertips" - Come and smell my lips Take the plunge into oblivion and dreams Speak to me Speak to me of love Kisses soft like a velvet glove And your skin, let me feel your touch You drive me crazy It's really too much But I have to go I can't love you anymore But I have to go It's time to forget His skin, his skin. What did she whisper to you? What? When? She went up to you and said something. You looked at me, laughed. I don't know. Something stupid. About me? Not at all. Why about you? I don't know. You okay? Did you fuck them all? The girls there tonight? How many did you fuck? I don't know. All of them? No. Emilie? Yes. How do I come off, Camille? The next one? Bimbo 4? Bimbo 5? It's no good. - Wait. - What? Like this if you want. Like this? How? Take me like this. Here, go on! Go on! You really want to? Yes. - You sure? - No. No I'm boring. - What? What was that? - I'm boring. Boring? You're bored with me. Not at all. - What you doing? - Getting water. I think I'll go home. Don't want to stay? You don't want to talk? No I want to be alone. As you like. What's the weirdest, most humiliating thing, that happened to you at work? - No answer? - No, I'm thinking. Once something really weird did happen. A guy asked me for a private chat, the usual. I said okay. Everything seemed normal. We start the chat, and I see a dog. A dog? A mutt. He had me perform for his mutt. No! I swear, he had his doggy on his lap. What did he ask you to do? To play with myself, but for his dog. To look it in the eyes and talk. "What a pretty dog." You can't imagine how weird it is, staring at a dog. And the dog was obviously... pretty expressionless. I felt really uncomfortable, it felt like animal abuse. At one point I almost burst out laughing, because... I wanted to see its dick. I wanted to see if the dog was hard! I got into a weird state of professional conscientiousness. Him, no. Deplorable. - Deplorable. - Met him, him too. Deplorable. - Him, no. - Deplorable. What do you think about him? Looks like a Judas. We work all day together. Some nights, without having dinner she comes over, we fuck, she gets up and leaves. End of story. And? I don't know when was the last time we slept together. What don't you like about it? She comes, she fucks, she goes. You can work on your doctorate. It's the change I dislike. She's changing the rules on me. That's what bothers me. Remember after that party, how she made a scene? When she wanted anal? You can be so annoying. - So what should I say? - Not that, anyway. I think... something changed after that. - Judas just texted. - Show me. - You won't like it. - Show me! "Give this poor wounded man a drink" "Suddenly, while the hussar was reaching toward him," "the man, some kind of Moor, aimed a pistol he was still holding...." The poem addresses the question of violence. He uses a war-related vocabulary, with words like "battle," "death," "pistol". Show me what you wrote. What's this? It's s-some ideas f-for stand-up. Let's have a look at... these ideas for stand-up. Maybe I'll laugh. Who knows? I don't care w-what you t-think. Number one: "Hobos in my neighborhood". "Hoboes" with an "e" please. Number two: "School bullying". Number three: "My dad's sexuality". Dad? Our dad? - You wrote stand-up about that? - Yeah. About what, exactly? About w-what he t-tells me. He tells you stuff? Like what? His s-sex l-life with the woman he met. He met someone since Mom died? So what exactly is Dad's sexuality? - He's involved in a-a... - No, drop it. I won't discuss Dad's sexuality with you. Y-you always say we don't talk enough. Hello. Nora! Eponine, this is Nora, my.... - Eponine, my sister. - Hi. Pleasure. "Eponine" is pretty. Where's it from? V-victor H-hugo, "Les M-Misérables", the d-daughter... We're preparing her finals. Okay... I'm getting some keys. You good? Fine. I overslept, I'm groggy. - Any phone calls? - No Do you have time for coffee? No, I have two visits and a couple coming back for that house. See you tonight. I don't know. I'll call you? Goodbye. Y-your girlfriend? Yes. Well, no. Truth is, I don't know. She s-seems n-nice. Just k-kidding. She doesn't look n-nice at all. Do you watch these videos often? Yes. What do you like about them? They're beautiful. The videos or me? Both. Don't touch. Do nothing. Do nothing! I'll do it all. You got it wrong, Camille. So did I. We both got it wrong. It's over, Camille, honey. We'll never meet again. A survey found that speaking to a crowd is people's number-one fear. Their number-two fear... is death. Seriously, think about that. It means that for most people, at a funeral, they'd rather be in the casket. Gotcha! - Is it good? - Yes, very. I didn't w-write it all. It doesn't matter. Your delivery's great. Your girlfriend's not h-here? No, she left. She was sick of you. Yep. - I can understand. - Good one. The truth is, the space she occupied never filled the void. I just feel sadder. Shittier. I think it's over. I'm tired of this. Who are you, sir? Leave his body, I want my brother back! Mr. Germain? I knocked but... - Can I help you? - The wheelchair. May I? It seems in good shape. Was it used a lot? No, about six months. Six months is good. It's not too beat up. Know how to fold it? No, but it can't be hard. Something like this. Can I help? - ًWhat? - Want help? No, I'll manage, at least I think so. - It's no big deal. - Shit! Something wrong? It's not a problem. I'll take it as is. It'll be fine. Are you asleep? Almost. Falling asleep. Goodnight. Wait! Can you leave it on? I don't want to be alone if I wake up. Emilie? Grandma died. Grandma died. What? What happened? It happened Monday night, or early Tuesday. Heart attack. The funeral's this weekend. We arrive in Paris on Saturday. Tuesday? You're crazy! Why didn't you call me? What would it have changed for you? Stop. Don't say that, don't say that. Don't make me feel guilty. I'm know you're sad. I'm sad too. When did you see her last? If you really cared about her, we'd have gotten the call from you on Tuesday. Stop it, Mom. They're selling the apartment. Want me to give you a hand? Since I know they're selling it, I feel relieved. This funeral is going to be a fucking ordeal. When is it? Sunday at 11. Want me to come? Really? Yes. All my family will be there. I guess so. You're sweet, but no. Why? It's not a good idea. Do I have to beg? So like, I'll introduce you to my parents? "Camille, an old friend." A good lover." No. Enough! You were right. I think I loved you and I still do. It's painful. If you come, you commit. If not, we're done, and that's fine. Don't speak. Okay, I have to go. Bye. SUNDAY What do you want to do? Take a walk? That way. Is something wrong? Nora! Look at me. Are you okay? Nora... Kiss me. Yes? - It's me. Should I come up? - I'm coming. - What now? - I love you, Emilie. Excuse me, I didn't hear. I love you. Can you say that again? I love you! No need to shout. PARIS 13TH DISTRICT
