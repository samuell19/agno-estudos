I knew it'd be you and me in the finals. Yeah! I'm going all out, okay? By the way, rei... The one who wins the judgment is allowed to enter the land of the dead. Is there someone you want to see? Someone I want to see, eh? Wihowld he soiezaikaty dow that's a secret. Hey, tsubasa. Don't go easy on me. Just what I wanted. But... I'd rather you didn't use spells. No. During the judgment, you can use spells as long as you don't use a madou brush. What, seriously?! Do not worry. I will not use any spells... Is what I'd like to say... But I am going all out as well. Fine. Looks like this will be a good duel. I bet you guys wish lord kouga was here so he could watch you two fight. No, that's incorrect. Eh? Kouga would have wanted to cross blades with the winner of our match. Yes. That is correct. Being a swordsman is in his blood, he would surely think this way. Zaruba... Is this the promised land? Hm? Stop. I'm not here to fight. Ow! You really saved me! How unusual. Are you human by, any chance? You're not human? Of course not! I'm an object. An object? Right! Everything that lives here is an object. My name! My name is... Oh right! It's meru! I'm meru! Thank goodness! I was worried I had forgotten it. So your name is meru? Meru. Why were you trapped in there? I was a tribute. See? I'm pretty, right? Hey! Say something! That's the only reason they captured you? In the green castle, there is a queen named judam. She's gathering up all the pretty things in this land. So that she can eat them. You saved my life! Unmm...? It's kouga. Kouga! Kouga. So why are you here? I've come to search for the fang of sorrow. Fang of sorrow? Does that sound familiar? I havent heard of it. Oh, but... If you go to the shrine of wisdom, you might learn something. Do you know where that is? I do, but... It's a very dangerous place. Danger is no problem. Fine! This way then. Is that right? So then, you left that pretty thing behind? What a pity. It's such a pity. I was hoping to put a new pretty thing in this one. Do you understand? However, you did not bring me anything. Can you promise to not fail next time? I see. Then, you can leave. Good work. There is no next time. Silly things. Esaruto! Yes! Coming! Queen judam, how may I serve you? Take care of this please. Yes, as you command! What's this?! I believe it's a human. This is a human? He has a scary face... But a pretty one. Directly below that sun is the shrine. Wait! You're really going? Yes. Don't worry. You... Seem strong. Are you... Human? Are you human? So you were the strange aura that I was sensing? What are you? Me? I am no one. No, I should say I'm no longer an object. I'm happy to have been able to talk with a human before disappearing. Be careful okay? See you. Scarecrow. Hey! What'd you just say? I just said, "see you, scarecrow .” Kakashi... It's just how you appear to me. I see... Kakashi, eh? I didn't mean anything by it. I must hurry ahead. No, it means something to me though. That'll do. That's my name. Yes... My name is... Kakashi? Kakashi? Kakashi? Kakashi? Kakashi? Kakashi? Kakashi? Kakashi? Kakashi? Kakashi?

This is a graveyard for objects who'e had their names and bodies taken from them. Name... please... Name... Please... I saw these earlier! They're nanashi. With no name or body, they'e become the nothingness. Hey! It's Mel I've returned! Oh, kuromaru! Arrgh! Ow ow ow ow! Listen to this, kuromaru. I'm... Kakashi. That's right. That's your masters new name! Got it?! Ka-ka-hi! It's okay! My heart's working properly! By the way, has the maryuu appeared yet, kuromaru? Pi pii... That damn woman! Kuromaru! We're going to retrieve the scale! Kuku ga mi! The scale is shining with joy! Indeed. We need to gather even more pretty things. This is the shrine of wisdom? This shrine has been here since ancient times. Depending on the person, the guardian of wisdom is said to be kind... Or terribly fearsome. Have you ever been inside? Looks like you can't cut it.

Apparently, he was revived when the human gave him a name. Next time, I'll have to destroy him more thoroughly. ♪ Pong ♪ Gross. Esaruto. Project pretty things please. Yes, ma'am! How pretty! And the singing is so lovely. What's wrong? Queen judam, I'm sorry to report... It looks like we've used up the energy of the objects in this area. Is that so? What a pity. Very well. I've grown tired of this landscape anyway... Let's move to a different location. As you command! Did the maryuu do that? No. It was the black wind. Also known as the maryuu's breath. This is the result of just the portent to its arrival. The maryuu appears when the moon turns completely black. If the maryuu appears, many objects will become the nothingness. When we become the nothingness, we... I want to help you... But I currently have no way of defeating the maryuu. And... I've come to this land searching for something. I need to take it back. What is it? The fang of sorrow, right? Yes. The maryuu appears from the sea of lamentation. Perhaps... Then... Maybe the maryuu's fang is the fang of sorrow? But why do you need that fang? To save many of my comrades... I made a contract with a great force. We call that great power, gajari. Gajari is not the ally of humans... Nor does he ally with the Makai. But thanks to the power that gajari granted us... We found a way to fight the demons. During the long battle, humans formed a contract with gajari. Jinkai = world of humans gajari promised to ally itself with jinkai for several hundred years. But the fang needed to do that was destroyed in the gap between dimensions. I(t wre clore nepomn [goed foung to gaffe ibe allmics of jfrdkedt will collapse... 000@ur, I see! They say that the maryuu appears from the gap between dimensions. If so...

I'm taking the scale back. Bebe guge gee! This is a human? Let's tease it! Who made humans? I don't know! Hey! Who made you? Humans smile, don't they? They cry don't they? They get angry, don't they?

But objects are different. We cannot create anything. And we're not all pretty... Fool! You're the dirtiest one of them all! See? Ugly, is it not. I really hate ugly things. It's so delectable. Kakashi speaks the truth. You have no right to speak of beauty. I do! I was dreampt up humans, after all! But... Even the pretty things they create... Eventually, humans forget about them.
