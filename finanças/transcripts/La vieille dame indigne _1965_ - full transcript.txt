A man who had not seen Mr Keuner for a long time greeted him with the words: “You haven’t changed a bit.” “Oh!” said Mr Keuner, and turned pale. - Bertolt Brecht. Some people marry early at 20 And do not wait years To have three or four children Who make your days Between shopping and dishes Between housework and lunch The world might disappear No time to think today Should we cry? We laugh about it Is it envy or pity? I don't have the heart to say Time does not run, it flies A smell of steaming coffee And that is all the world Children play, the husband smokes The days pass in reverse Hardly do we see children born which must be kissed And from the windows the young pass Should we cry? We laugh about it Is it envy or pity? I don't have the heart to say Time does not run, it flies It was noted on Sunday Ironed clothes and suits Some flowers or bouquets Decorate the dining room. When a life is summed up Millions of steps are trivial Taken as a hammer and an anvil Between a table and a wardrobe Should we cry? We laugh about it Is it envy or pity I don't have the heart to say Time does not run, it flies. Time does not run, it flies. Leave me alone! Quit it! Open up! I'm sick of seeing creeps here! This isn't a brothel. I'll smash your face in. I don't mean as much as those guys? Asshole! Madame Berthe... Hi there, Madame Berthe ... I have to telephone Dr Ernest. OK, I'll go ... Yet another attack... Is it serious? Are you serious? It's busy. It's close ... ... I can tell. Insist, if it's urgent. That's Rosalie, she works in the restaurant. I know, Ernest. Thank you. Now Madame should return to her husband. Rosalie will alert the doctor, I'll tell Charles to let Albert know. He lives far away! He's not busy, at this time he goes to the bar. Give me the book. Kitsinakis telephoned. Here's the memo. He said he's expecting you. Three trips to the sand S.P.A.C. ... as noted ... Your father's sick, Albert. Phone your mother ... ... she called the doctor ... You should call ... Where are you going? To practice. Tonight? No! I haven't rehearsed all week. You'll see Grandma. Grandpa is serious. He was serious six months ago ... Why don't you? Kitsinakis is going to call me ... ... I can't leave my best customer ... ... although my father's this serious. Look! You listening? Leave the guitar! Your friends can wait ... Pierre, don't start up! The life is not just made of amusement. Take the truck. As soon as they come ... call me. Don't leave her alone ... If it's going badly, I'll finish with Kitsinakis. THE SHAMELESS OLD LADY "Far, far, far away In the truth of the morning Far, far away. Very far A life of man to which we aspire. Far, far away. Very far. It slips between your hands. Berthe? Grandma? Grandfather died. Here I am mama, here ... Oh, Lucien, my little one... And so handsome! Charles, give me my black bag. Already a man, huh? Here, a truck! Like your dad and uncle... ... soon it'll be a real one! There, there, Rose! My angel ... you're a real Berthe. When we saw papa...! Poor papa! If we had seen him...! I'm sure we would have! Poor little thing, it's terrible! Time flies so... I saw him leave home. Remember? It's like it was yesterday! That's true... I'll see you ... You're stubborn! The store can't do a thing. Who's going to take responsibility? Robert's the only one who knows that job ... and Robert likes to travel. Don't think that you want to be buried with this. And let's not forget all the debts. Look at the accounts. It's very clear. We've seen how mother does numbers ... You see? This spells it out. And this? And this? The shop is full of debts! Or were they both hiding it ... Poor Albert! The trade is like this. You know that. She has hidden it. But, mama ... Sell the store, Albert ... It's local ... ... the materials and machinery... will be enough to pay the debts ... It sickens me to sell off my father's... Don't understand ... Who's responsible? You, Albert? Do we have any vinegar? No bread? I'm starved ... Berthe, you shouldn't ... You'd just let mama work today? Her house is roomy! You could stay if you like. I understand, I'm not stupid. Is it that your apartment is small? I think I've shown I'm reasonable. ... when I saw that you were leaving a steady job ... modest, but safe ... ... you understand. But, you did well. - Listen, Gaston... - If it is possible. You have debts of the truck... I'm talking about bills, ... not that you owe me immediately ... ... I can wait a bit. That leaves ... If I remember correctly ... ... about two bills, payable. There's much competition. That, I know ... Of my six trucks, one stays in the garage. And leave her alone? Robert! Albert! Come to bed! Want a coffee? In your nice big car? We're not going to meet anymore? You're not going to leave her alone, right? Your father isn't crazy ... If you've got no work, you're lost ... If I was your father ... No, I don't want to go there... ... and your fine brother? It doesn't matter to me if Berthe is taken in by the others... What's Gaston say? And Rose, what does she say? The hotel, then. Aren't you finished yet? I love your voice ... You like her? She's easy. She's at the restaurant. She's very popular there. You can get in line ... ... call me. He can wait, while I ... Speak with a forked tongue! Thank you, Gaston, thank you, Rose ... ... I won't go to live with you. I'd rather live alone in this house ... If you want to sell the warehouse you can handle it. Your father saw someone who was interested ... There's already a buyer? That's good news! The paperwork could be signed over, eh, Gaston? Albert is the best ... Be reasonable eh, mamma? I am, Simone. Keep your spirits up. You each give me a little. Not very much, but enough. For the things that I need. Every 15 days, in the vase, with the writing: "His loving son." I'll take you home ... Go with Gaston. Sit there. You'll have no such thing! A day like today! Come mama, this is more comfortable ... MAY I've had enough of this scandal! You're deafening me, I'm sick of telling you. I'm telling your father, Robert. You're always coming and going. How are you, Madame Berthe? Fine, Ernest. You're out now, are you better? I'm here, but I'm not well. They manhandled me for everything. They even tied me up! I can barely talk. But I'm not going back. I'd rather die before going back! Cheer up! It was so long, Bertha ... Good morning, Madame Boudan. Same again? No, the claret ... As part of the progress of automation in the Metro ... ... there's no walking in the corridors ... ... now only in the aisle. Shall we go? ... ... if you've finished, we could see a film? Maybe so, darling ... Still not finished? Have a drink! Opportunist. Asshole! Just look at that ... JULY We share what? Only 3 trips for us! He has 12 large trucks. Your truck is too small. We never see it. - Got it? - He bribes you! I profit working! If you are not happy, talk to the boss! Go to hell! Hey, there's work to do here. Not that you care. It's a juicer ... Allow me ... ... You put sliced fruit in here ... ... centrifugal force separates the rind from the pulp ... See the grill on this side? ... The juice comes out here ... These things have been around for years. I've been living far away. Music! A beer! Two numbers on the fat one! Got my money back! That's luck! That's the game, Albert. Messages! Come on! One trip to Kitsinakis. Turn that down a bit! Is your mother coming soon? Preparing food for Pierre. Before going home. Living in L'Estaque again ... Mama, we're here at last! If Pierre is going to my neighbourhood, I'll leave with him now ... You're not serious! It's been three months without seeing each other, coming and going. If you must go into the city ... ... it won't be an hour. Sit a while and you'll be able to take the bus ... No, to be honest ... ... I'd rather wait in the city. The bus is always full ... That's not true! Old people get seats, it's the rule! Well, excuse me ... ...but why you came, then? I came to see you ... and I've seen you ... Tell me ... You don't like here, maybe. You live cramped, my poor childs. What time is this to come home? I want you to come home from school. Directly, do you hear? Hey ... I wanted to... talk about the board ... This month has been hard ... ... even harder ... Well ... ... if you want ... ... today I'll give you half. The rest after the 15th ... The insurance is after the 15th ... The others paid? Yes, I got it. Don't worry ... Do you play much? We rehearse when we can. My friends have formed a group. We're preparing for a contest... ... that will take place in Paris. Can you get any money for this? A little, for the time being. But we can win. Some people earn a lot at this. And what does your father think? He thinks it's a noise. I didn't want to tell you. I phoned Ernest. Eating at the restaurant day in, day out. Food costs money. Who ate the leftovers. Who knew the value of money. I hate this situation. Look at my life. I live in this cage with my family. A man shouldn't work like a donkey. Meanwhile the house at L'Estaque is practically empty. And we don't have enough to waste eating at a restaurant. We're already halfway there. ... I'll get the bus from here. You don't need to wait. You and Papa already talked about it. He was right. Go on, you'll be late ... See you, pop star! - Even after clean house? - Yes The position of the steering wheel is comfortable ... ... corresponding to both style and power ... ... sure and safe tracking ... How about the brakes? It has four disc brakes ... ... which allows rectilinear braking to any ... ... speed ... That's 17 horsepower, you understand ... You can accelerate up to 260 kph That's comfortable driving ... With four speeds synchronised ... The radio is included in all models ... It's an excellent line ... It's very, very ... OCTOBER The door! There's nothing. Why look? A token. Turn down that racket, that's not music. Your father's not so good ... Got any ideas? Nothing! Working with rocks. Some luck. No. .. it's very awkward ... Do I have friends? Do I have friends? Rosalie! Your grandmother! They left in the evening ... ... they're friends. She's friends with that one... Yes! Rosalie's a hooker! the waitress in the restaurant ... ... where was grandmother going all this time? ... disturbing, huh? Ernest called me and told me. They're always together! Rosalie left work so that they have more time. First the restaurant, now out walking. It's only been six months since the old man died. Now she's going to the cinema ... ... Yes, going to the movies! Openly walking on the city streets. Look at me, do I go to the cinema? It's not possible for this to go on, you must do something. You're her grandson. Tell her what you think of her conduct. But break it gently ... ... she is old ... I can't do it... ... the truth is that she doesn't listen to me. She'll listen to you. Think of this in your home. You should tell her today. Go home, now. Hurry! I'm sure she'll hear you out. Hello, Grandma. Thanks ... That's beautiful. I've never seen this shirt before. It's just an old one ... I've prepared something for you ... ... You need something lighter ... What are you waiting for? Afraid? Stop your suffering. Spend your money, stupid! ... Your father understood it. Rosalie intimidates you? It's never going to happen! I'll have them ready the day after tomorrow. How will I go to work tomorrow? You're sexier without shoes. Feed your dog and it won't eat your shoes. He's just a pup, and teething. Well ... tomorrow afternoon. Every day, more and more young, eh? Rosalie ... and each day more beautiful. Wait, I'm going to close up... We've waited for you! They're in here. It's Berthe's idea ... Made in Scotland? It's a sign the world is changing, Julian. We were drinking rum not so long ago. Yes ... from Paris, dummy! Although Berthe doesn't drink much, the level's low More than a litre per month! With or without TV this evening? Image and sound, or mute? Sound it is! If we like it, we'll leave it on. I made coffee. Whiskey's there! That's an old mill. It's a souvenir! Don't judge objects by their appearance. ... white or black, aerodynamic or not ... a coffee grinder ... ... for me, is a grinder. But it's not electric, Alphonse. Tonight on Oriental Theatre... 'The Daughter of the Dragon King' Broken. A whiskey! Don't have any ... A rum ... -"River, i go to you"... - Oh, no! I think we can turn it off. That villain! That beast! What are the masks for? The actors were using masks. To be understood. Today, the mask is the screen, which puts itself on ... Then you'll see the car advertisements, so rest. No, you side with the owners of the roads? Schemes that produce bourgeois fools ... Let me tell you ... don't lose a good occasion to be silent... The burgoeoise aren't loafers Idiots, to be sure. As sure as the automobile... ... is the product of all previous inventions ... ... the wheel, iron, steel ... ... the universal attraction, physics, engine, America. To reject it would be like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Demagogue! I owe my life to the automobile! Precisely, a car! It was ... ... in Shanghai in 1927. We were poor, I was only little, cold and sick ... My father had a shop outside... ... and a car. But you were poor capitalists In Hong Kong ... Not in Shanghai, things were cheap. It was in 1927. Chiang Kai-shek, stirring the revolution ... ... my father, an old revolutionary... ... avoided comrades for my sake. But one night he went out to check. It was a big night ... in the Kuomintang enclosures ... ... there's gunfire and he was lost ... The neighbours told me He'd been driving ... and swerved the car ... And threw himself into the fray! What do you think? We've heard it before. Quite a mixture! I've already read what you just talked about! So what? Go on! It's plagiarism, don't you get it? What do you want? What's the big deal, you want to spoil the evening? This anarchist speaks like a publisher. Plagiarism! Let's say ... an adaptation, eh? If you don't quote authors then it's plagiarism. It's not your story. 'It is good to boast of one who writes great books ... ... as this generation has demonstrated. The philospher Tchoung, in the prime of his life... ... wrote a book of 100 thousand words, 9/10 of which were quotations Now such books cannot be written, inspiration is absent. The ideas are produced in the workshop ... ... presenting itself as that one who doesn't manage is lazy It neither assumes thought exists ... nor formulates what we could quote. Ideas need little to operate. A pen and paper ... Such unique materials that may lead a man ... ... to make a hut. They do not know major buildings other than ... ... those a man can build. " End of quote. Who said that? I'm not going to tell you. Read my mind! Could he drive? So you lied. I'm always lying, Julian ... FEBRUARY You care? As long as I pay my board. Money, money! Only think of one thing. You want to talk about it? Neither parents or money mean anything to you, just music ... If I got into debt it's not because you weren't bringing in money If it wasn't for your friends. All I hear is "My friends" ... ... "Our group." "Today we have to rehearse", all for friendship! You'd leave everything to play in some run-down bar. Be ideal! Only interested in money! Nothing but money! Where you going? Stay here! Let go of it! Dear Gaston. I guess you and your family are well. I don't have any other news about mother. I'd told you already about the squandering going on... As you know the winter has been hard ... ... and I couldn't send the money as promised. I beg you to have patience ... ... I'm working alone now. " We both know each other.. ... what I mean is ... Who are you? You want news of your grandmother? We don't have to talk about that. We could go to the bar for a drink. Good idea! And my companion? What do you think you're doing? Leaving the band without warning? Cradle-snatching now, are you? Go to hell! Get out! It's none of your business. Cut it out! Unbelievable. THE GARDEN MAY Do you pay well for old stuff? Depends what you call old ... ... and for you, what pays well. I'd have to see for myself... So look at it. Where? Look through the rooms and say what you're interested in ... Everything's for sale? Everything old. Right...everything must go! But are you the owner? Oh, the papers...that's OK. We pay well. Copper is good. That's in good condition. I can see that it's been cared for. Everything? All of it. And the photo? Take the frame ... A vest. Shirts. Underwear doesn't count ... An overcoat, a hat, a cane ... A clear garment and summer smocks ... Have you seen something you like? Follow me, please ... It's simple, Berthe ... The horses are numbered for betting ... ... you bet before the race ... ... for a place or a win. For example, 1st, ... or in the top three. You pay at the betting counters. Those white buildings over there... They give you a ticket ... Whoever wins, collects it from there. A lot or a little ... ... depending on the number of bets. And if you lose? Tear up the ticket. And the "trifecta"? That consists of ... three horses in play ... ... in order of finishing, or not in order. In disorder! And everyone plays? Almost. It's a lot of money. If you lose ... ... who gets the money? The State. You would have to know the horses ... ... if not ... it's too risky! NOTARY Ice cream. Vanilla and chocolate, with cream. Would you be able to drive it? Madame has a unique opportunity ... ... this is one of the cheaper and more solid models. Would you believe it's gone 100,000 km? Check the motor. Like new! It squeaks. It's nothing, a drop of oil ... This is bent. It's a bumper, it straightens up ... ... American paint job and perfect nickel plating. You'll love this car. It smells funny! Turn on the headlights. Wait! Go and look. They're going. What's this button? The windshield wipers. That squeaks too! It's normal! And this ball? The gear shift. Are these good seats? They've been re-done specially ... ... and, you'll note ... ... they recline right back. How? With a lever. That makes a good bed! If you'll allow me ... If you're travelling at night and get tired ... Pretty good ... .. the seats, yes. And the engine? Let's check this engine. Want to see? It's little! Can't you change it? You can pay for this in installments ... ... and it comes with a guarantee. I'll pay cash. It's possible to sleep in it... ... but it's gone 100,000 km, the doors squeak ... ... it smells like its old owner ... ... and you're asking this price? It's a unique opportunity. You don't need to bargain and haggle. Never buy a fish without looking at its belly! How nice, you've come to see Grandma. You're quieter today. You know each other? ... not long. I'm glad to see you. Want a snack? Give him some bread and butter. How's Victoire? And your father? Just ... getting by. There was an accident. Was it serious? He went to the hospital. He was taken in an ambulance. The surgeon said it was a close call. ...It was at work ... he was very nervous ... When he got operated on. Poor thing ... we should see him ... ... no, he's at home now ... Ah, well! I was worried. What happened exactly? The truck was supported by a rock ... ... it slipped and fractured his leg... Is it serious? He broke his leg! Is that it? That's hardly serious! Well, it isn't medically ... But there are other problems. He won't work for a month. During the day I'm a temp ... ... At night, I'm in the band. ... There are many expenses ... ... and a low income. I thought that maybe now ... ... if you wanted ... Eat up. You've done well. I'm proud of you. You've got a backbone. You did the right thing ... You understand that it was you that should help him. And not an old woman like me. Feeling down? Don't lose heart. A month will fly by. Albert will recover ... ... cured ... ... we'll see what we should do. Sit down. Have a drink and cheer up... Are you playing tonight? We don't play on Tuesday. Come with us, then. Did you know we have a car? We hardly take it out, let's go today. You can drive. That's your profession, right? Rosalie will keep an eye on you. I think we'll go to the sea. Gaston looked like a schoolteacher. He knew more Latin than a priest. He was serious, hardworking. No surprises in the postwar period. Three years with no news ... ... married to someone wealthy and rich. Simone has a head like that! It's a machine! And Albert? Albert ... he's prouder than Gaston. But more affectionate! As for Rose. ... like a girl. Awkward, but sensitive ... The usual knocks, even today. He not changed. He will get hurt. Switch places and show me. Come on. Push the seat forward. I know that. You have long legs. Watch your hands. Are we starting? We're ready! What do you think, will you be able to drive it? You doubted us, Berthe? Was it a bond? It was a test. Today we have a teacher. OK, let out the clutch slowly ... there we are. Such pretty lights! ... Where's my house? There. More to the left. Nearby, after the black thing ... ... those lights ... They're so far! I'm going to go back. If you want to continue walking ... I'll accompany myself. Pierre can drive there. Head for the port. I like it there. I know, I saw you walking there once. Yes? ... It's beautiful. JUNE Gaston! Come in, come in. Thanks mama, but I should watch my liver ... just a little water will do ... I thought I'd make the most of a business trip and call in to see you ... So here I am. Sure enough. How's Simone? Well. And Charles? Okay. And Rose? ... Rose is just Rose ... ... she's fine, getting into fashion... hats, ribbons ... You've got some new friends? One of them's a shoemaker. Is he interesting? He has seen so much ... And ... your girlfriend? Gaston, I'm delighted that Charles and Simone are well ... ... and that you've come here. You should see to Rose more frequently, she's often alone ... Now I have to go out ... We'll go to the cemetery. To see Papa's grave ... ... ... We thought that you might come with us. You can manage by yourself. It's the 3rd on the left, in the 7th row ... ... now I've got to go ... I'll tell you: I get the feeling that she's not bothered. And I find her very well. ... because she seems happy. You're right ... Happy, but it could just be a performance ... No! I'm not saying that. I know how she is ... all's very well. It's like ... say ... a change of direction. But what about the money? You can joke about it if you want. - You're rich. - Wrong, Albert. Leave it to Mama! I have a standard of living imposed on me ... It's not easy. A franc is a franc for me, too. - So I owe you. - No, Albert. It's not as you think ... I wanted to write to you, make a proposition. Aren't we the same? As brothers? What you owe to me ... You can consider a contribution ... My contribution ... Not that I want to force you, no. ... Think about it calmly, and decide. you have till the end of summer ... AUGUST I always tell you what she does. But I don't want to get mixed up in it ... A doctor? What would you say to a doctor? She's not unbalanced. Distracted, maybe. Nobody can be denied that right ... "Dear Gaston ... I hope ... ... that you and your family are well. I went to see your lawyer ... to bring the papers that he wanted. He said .. within eight days everything will be sorted. I thought you'd come to sign it but he says he can do it ... ... by mail. I did the necessary thing, now let's wait ... Now I see ... ... that was the best solution. Victoire said that I'm upset ... ... because of our mother ... that's foolishness ... Since she left with her friends, there's been no word from her ... Nobody knows where they are ... no letters or postcards. " Madame, if you pay the security deposit... ... and pay management, I am not opposed to reforms. But shoes in "self-service" ... what next? ... Goodbye, sir! This summer came as no surprise to me. I believe Rosalie drove her to it. I read about so many accidents in the newspaper it's a topic that often comes up ... Their behaviour isn't suitable. I don't want to know ... But ... I'm restless ... You can't read something else? It's Ernest ... about your mother ... ... want to take it inside? They returned yesterday. They're fine ... they've been summering for a month ... You could have written ... Don't start! It's not like you hadn't others ... Not even a postcard! I'm not your property! I want to be free! Rosalie, come to my side ... Get off! Why did you sleep with me? Was it just a game? Isn't causing a scandal with Berthe enough? Scandal? What? You asshole! It's what you did ... I didn't do anything What did I do? SEPTEMBER Come on now, no tears! Toulouse isn't far! Write, visit. We'll see the sailors from the fleet. Rosalie will handle the tassles and the business will be fine. Can you live without a car? Yes! And no shoes? No! ... Two years as manager and I'll own the business. It's a sure thing ... ... it's a mess. Send a photo. I'll make it to Petitjean. Come here, Rosalie ... Like this, that's great! It's exciting. Come on! Let's not drag out the goodbye. It's not final. Sunday, come and see me ... That's enough, now. It's stupid! What will we do this evening? Go to the movies. The phone ... Rosalie? That's weird. Are you sure ... Are you ... wait. Listen! ... What? Where? She has ... White! You painted it white? My uncle has become a partner ... They were in her room ... They were going to the cinema. Do you figure it was Rosalie ... I don't need to look any further than that fox ... Rosalie had the car, obviously. And Alphonse ... ... on, he went earlier. To Toulouse. Didn't you know? They're going to buy a new shoe shop. With that money ... FOR PIERRE. No trace left here ... She should have savings ... ... or she mortgaged it all! Swindled out of insurance. "With the funds ... She successively lived two lives. The first ... ... as Miss, wife and mother, the second as Mrs Berthe ... ... single person ... ... no obligations and of modest means ... The first life was a hard 60 years ... ... the second, only 18 months. but after long years of slavery and short months of freedom ... she ate the bread of life until its last crumbs. " Some people marry early at 20 And do not wait years To have three or four children And be busy all day Between shopping and dishes Between housework and lunch The world might disappear No time to think today Should we cry? We laugh about it Is it envy or pity? I don't have the heart to say Time does not run, it flies.
