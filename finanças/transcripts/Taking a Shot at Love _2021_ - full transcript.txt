RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Come in! Hi. Your life is a perpetual coffee commercial. You know this, right? The only thing missing is some guy in flannel coming up behind you in a tender hug, and together, you gaze out at the winter landscape. And then two minutes later, we're both arguing over who left the coffee ring on the counter. You're such a romantic. I know, right? Thank you for driving me today. You didn't have to do that. You told me that you would not drive me unless I baked you something. Did I? Well, I also have a few errands to run in town. Plus, I'll take any excuse to leave the lonely confines of my home office. Maybe Matt can start working from home, you know, keep you company. I'd like to stay married. Come on. After you. Thank you. Want to come over later and watch a movie with me and Matt? I would, but I have dinner plans tonight. With who? My cousin, Terry. I'm really sorry to disappoint you. You'll find your "flannel man" someday. Who said I was looking? My life is just fine as is, thank you very much. Okay. Bye. - Happy new year! - Happy new year! Only a couple days left of winter break, huh? Don't remind me. Well, I think I know how to cheer you up. I just got word that we are the featured performance on the final weekend of the Avon winterfest! Where are Avery and Grace? Hi. Are the girls here? Actually, that's what we came down here to talk to you about... You guys, start warming up. Let's go, guys! Move it up, move it up! Let's go! Move it up! That's it, that's it. Good. Good! Still feeling some pain in that ankle, huh, Ryan? "Ryan" instead of "Coop"? It's like the hockey coach equivalent of a parent calling their kids by their full name when they're in trouble. I think maybe you are having some trouble. Yeah, okay, fine, the ankle is still a little inflamed, but I haven't played since the beginning of the season. If you don't get me back, we're not going to have a shot at the next round of the playoffs. We do need you, but I can't let you play if you're not 100%. If you have pain and a high-ankle sprain, it means the ligaments aren't strong enough. It's showing. Your transitions are slower and your lateral movements are less sharp. I've done every single therapeutic protocol the team has asked me to do, and then some. I know you did, but you're not where you need to be. Not yet. I'm meeting with your agent tomorrow morning. We'll have to decide where to go from here. So what's going on? Is something wrong? Are the girls okay? They're fine. It's just, over the holidays, they tried out for the dance company team, and they made it. That's great. Of course, it's completely different than what we do here... We know, and we thought that they could do both, it's just the dance team is such a huge time commitment. It's four days a week, plus competitions on weekends... We had to make a choice. Are you pulling the girls out of ballet completely? We're so sorry to spring it on you like this. Would you ever consider starting a dance team here? That's just not what I do. I opened this studio to teach ballet and a love of dance. When it becomes a competition, it just changes everything. You know, in the end, I hope the girls can still look at dance as something they love to do. Thank you for letting me know. Of course. Take care now. You're my favorite cousin, Jenna. Nobody does comfort food like you do. Are you sure you don't want to stay the night? The guest house is yours if you want it. Thanks, but I've got to head back to the city after this. I only came up to do a little scouting in Hartford with the Wolf Pack. That's a hockey team, right? You're killing me. Yes. They are the Minor League Team for the New York Rangers... Which is also a hockey team. Yeah. How's work going for you, huh? How's the studio? Honestly, not great. I just lost a couple dancers to one of those competitive dance teams. And they decided to raise rent on me at the end of the month. It's just bad timing. I just wish everything could stay the same. - One second. - Yeah. Is everything okay on your end? Yeah. I have this client, who's rehabbing from a high-ankle sprain, and... It's just not going well. That's a tough injury to come back from. But you did. You got back on stage. What did you do to rehab it? I went back to the basic ballet fundamentals and I had to rebuild from the ground up. I actually have a couple of dancer friends in New York who train professional football players with the same technique that I used. It makes a huge difference with strength, balance, agility... It works. Interesting. Good to know. Coop! Coop! Hey, Coop. Are you back with the team now? Not quite yet, but soon. Because my dad bought me your jersey for Christmas, and said I could exchange it for someone else's if you retire. Well, I promise, you won't have to exchange anything. Thank you. Nice to meet you. We're running out of options here, Coop. I need you to be doing whatever it takes to get you back where you were before the injury. Terry, I have done everything there is to do. Not everything. What else is there? I have done infrared therapy, I have done acupuncture, stem-cell injections... What I have in mind... And what I talked to coach Jackson about... Is nothing like that. Then what is it like? Well, it's like... Ballet. In that it is ballet. Yeah, right, okay. And for the record, tutu is not a good look for me. All right, listen, hear me out, Coop. All right, I was talking to my cousin, Jenna about this just yesterday, all right? She had the same injury as you do, when she was a professional ballet dancer. She used basic ballet fundamentals to rehab her own injury... Got her back to 100%. Is this the part where you tell me to become somebody's ice-dancing partner and we try out for the Olympics? This is serious, Ryan. A lot of pro athletes are having success with the same technique. Jenna can get you there, too. And the Rangers... They're fully on board with the idea. Listen, as your agent and as your friend, I'm going to be blunt. If you don't do something right now... ...the closest you'll get to playing in the NHL again is... Don't say that out loud. I can't even think about what I would do if I wasn't able to play anymore. You don't have to think about that for a long, long time. Unless you give up. I'll see myself out. Terry, I said ballet therapy is a great idea... But I teach ballet to kids, not hockey players. Can't he find someone in New York to do it? No, no. He's actually going to be starting back with the Wolf Pack. You know, weight training, eventually some ice time... And then hopefully back with the Rangers before the playoffs. And I live near the rink, so I'm guessing this is a convenience thing. Look, I would hire you no matter where you lived. All right? You're the only one I trust. You know exactly what to do. And, more importantly, you understand more than anyone else what he's going through right now. And they're willing to pay plenty of money for you to sign on. Terry, it's not about the money. It's just not what I do. But thank you for thinking of me. Let's talk soon, okay? All right. Think about it? Okay, I'll think about it. Bye. Thomas! How are you, Jenna? Hi. I'm good. You know, I'm glad I caught you. I wanted to talk about that rent increase and possibly pushing it a month or two? Is the business okay? It's fine. I'm just having some turnover with the older students. I wish I could help, but the increase is for the entire building. I can't really make exceptions for one tenant over another. Of course. I just thought I would ask. I really am sorry, but... I'm sure the Avon winterfest will be great publicity for your studio. I hope you can make it. If there's anything I can do, let me know. You can not raise the rent... Except that. I'm so sorry. Catch you next time. Exactly how much money is "plenty"? Car service is here. Jenna said she'll be expecting you at the guest house in the next couple hours. You're sure this "guest house" is as good as a hotel? Trust me. It's better. Then why isn't it already booked up like the hotel is? Well, she normally rents it out in the fall for all the leaf peepers, but she's doing me a "family favor". You're sure you're not just hiring her because she's family? She really knows what she's doing? Coop, I wouldn't trust your future to anyone I didn't have complete confidence in. And if it doesn't work? It will. I'm sure of it. Time for you to go show everybody how strong you really are. All right. - Hi. - I got your message, Jenna. This is amazing! Coop's one of my favorite players! I thought his name was Ryan. It's Ryan Cooper. Ryan "Coop" Cooper. Okay, you saying it like that isn't going to make me know who he is. You didn't even look him up online? No. I just know he's one of Terry's clients. Well, clearly, he has veneers. And since when do you watch hockey? I do when Matt's out of town. He's really just not a hockey person. Welcome to my world. Still, you should study up on the game before he gets here. I don't need to. What I do works for any sport. I am helping him build the foundation he needs to support the entire structure of the foot and ankle. Still, you should probably know something about hockey. Okay, ice skates, sticks, pucks, and fighting. I give up. Oh, no! I just fixed that. Terry was right. Yes! Ta-dah! Okay... ...and the score remains two-all. Seriously, you call that a hit, Adams? You... Must be Jenna. That's me. And you must be Ryan Cooper. Yep. Sorry, I've got to ask, do you normally come in without knocking? To my own house? Yes. Wait, did you think this was the place you were renting? This isn't the rental house? No. This is my house. Let me show you where the guest house is. I'm sleeping in the garage? No, that is a fully-furnished, impeccably-decorated suite above the garage. Okay. Hang on. You told me to look for the key underneath the flower pot, which it wasn't, by the way. It was underneath the mat. Because that's where you keep the spare key to your house. Bet that happens all the time. You're the first. It's a really nice house, by the way. - Any chance I... - Definitely not. No. You're used to getting everything you want, aren't you? Can I be honest with you, Jenna? Right now I'm not getting anything I want. Yeah. You're acting like I brought you into an abandoned shack. This place is great. Yeah, but yours is better. Unbelievable. All right, this binder right here will tell you everything you need to know about the area. Shopping, food... Food. Most important. The big thing right now is the "Avon winterfest". They have different events every weekend in January, so you have the art walk, food fair... Then on the final weekend, they have performances from bands, theaters, and local dance studios... Mine included. You're not going to make me perform, are you? No. That's just for my regular students. So... Where's the TV? It's broken. Sorry, I'm just not used to having renters here so soon. They usually come in the fall. That's right. Terry told me you rent to leaf-peepers. You know, I prefer "foliage enthusiasts". So, Terry was saying that you have weight training at 10:30 a.m. With the Rangers' Minor League Team in Hartford? Wolf Pack. Yeah. So you can meet me at the studio at 11:30 a.m. Right from the rink. We'll have our private lesson. Can we say twelve? Man's gotta eat. Yeah, okay. Noon is fine. Just make sure you eat something healthy. I don't want you coming in weighed down. Healthy eating is a top priority. Clearly. Also, please try not to be late. My first afternoon class is at one. So, guess I'm really doing this. You know, I'm going to teach you how to work through basically the same exact injury I had. I know what I'm doing and you're going to be fine. I hope you're right, 'cause if you're not, I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Knock, knock! Hi! Ryan, this is my neighbor, Erin. Hi, Ryan! I just popped over to say welcome to Avon. Thank you! Seriously? I like to make a good impression. Well, Erin, it is a pleasure to meet you. And you can call me "Coop". Okay... Coop. Okay, we're going to just let you get settled. If you need anything, let me know. Otherwise, I will see you at the studio tomorrow. At class. - Come on. - I'll be there. Twelve noon on the dot. Bye, "Coop"! Let's go. Bye. Unbelievable. Hey, class. Come on in, let's get started. You guys ready? I am so sorry I'm late. No problem. It's just there was a bunch of kids waiting for me outside the XL center, and I didn't want to disappoint them. That's very nice of you. So you like kids, then? Sure. That's good to know! Let's get started. Wait. Here? With them? I thought this was going to be, like, a private class. It was. At noon. You can put these on. Hey, class, listen up, this is Mr. Cooper, and he's going to be dancing with us today. But this is his first ballet lesson, so he's going to need a lot of encouragement, okay? Can we encourage him? Okay, I get it. You're trying to embarrass me because I'm late. No, I am trying to give you the lesson the Rangers paid for. This is literally what we'd be doing anyway. Do you think you can keep up? Let's go. First... All the way up, and... Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn. Yes! Good job! One more time. Open that up. Try to feel that stretch. All the way up. Skip. Point your toes. Okay. That's it for today. And back up. Back up. All right, what did you think of your first class? That was a piece of cake. Good morning. I'm about to make some coffee. You want some? What did you do to me? Everything is sore. I can barely move. How is that even possible? I was in class with five-year-olds! Everything that hurts are the smaller muscles you've been ignoring your entire life. If you're sore, it means I'm doing my job. Well, I have to weight train with the Wolf Pack. How am I supposed to do that if I can't move? Well, you're a professional athlete. You know how to stretch, right? You just have to loosen up a little. You'll be fine. Yeah. Everything will be fine. How much longer is this going to take? This is the last pour, don't worry. You're messing with me, right? How do you make coffee? I don't know, you stick the cup in the thing, press the button, bam, you got coffee. Move on with your day. Here we go. Thank you. You're welcome. It's better, right? It's snobbier, I'll give you that. I am as far from snob as it gets. What's that? This... Is a bacon and cheese quiche. Fancy. If you want, you can just call it an egg pie, okay? Happy now? Completely. Hi-gee? It's pronounced "hue-guh". I can see why you changed your last name to "Wagner". No! It's a Danish word. Really, it's more of a way of life. It was my grandparents' philosophy when they moved here from Denmark, and that's what they named the farm after. It's all about cultivating feelings of happiness and warmth and family. A feeling of being safe at home, and being cozy. So, like, an existential blanket? Okay, have you ever sat in front of a warm fire, drinking a hot cup of cocoa, and you are surrounded by your friends and family, and all you are thinking is, "this is what life is all about"? That depends. Is there a hockey game on? You know, your life can't be about your career 24/7. Actually, yes, I can. I have since I could walk. Well, maybe you could use a little more balance. Balance? Isn't that what ballet is for? That's not what I meant. Look, no offense, but I didn't come for warm blankets and fireside chats. I came here to get my life back. Yeah. I totally get it. Isn't your ride for the rink about to get here? Yeah. I need to go. You know, I can actually put your coffee in a to-go mug if you want. Wait, I thought you needed to make that mug on a pottery wheel first. Very funny. Okay... All right, I will see you at noon. - Yes. - That means twelve o'clock p.m. Yes, yes, thank you. And make sure you stretch before practice. Yeah. Will do. You're late again. I got stuck behind a school bus, so... You know, safety first! Let's just get started. All right. All right, good job. You can bring it down now. Perfect. So... How was weight training? Were you able to work through some of the soreness? Almost... Except the team's ice bath and jacuzzi are both broken. Busted pipes in the training room. Luckily for you, I have an ice bath at home. Really? Yes. In the form of a nearly-frozen pond. A little polar bear plunge? Sounds good to me. You wouldn't really go in there, would you? Yeah, it's the exact same thing as an ice bath... Plus fish. Okay... We are going to review your pliés, so let's get into first. Can you turn out a little more? Just a little bit more. There we go. And plié. Good job. You remembered. All right, one more. Demi-plié. Great. All right, we're going to add another element. It's called a "glissade". Glissade. Just think toe-ball-heel, but it has to sound almost silent. So, it looks like this. Start in fifth... And... Glissade. Softly. It should be almost silent. Why does it have to be silent? Because it shows that you have control over the smallest muscles in your foot, creating a base of strength for the ankle, taking all the pressure off of your ligament. Think of it like building a house. You wouldn't build a house without a solid foundation, right? This right here... This is the concrete. What? It's cute, you're using "guy stuff" to try to get through to me. Well, is it working? Kind of. Except if you were building a house, what about the rebar? Quads, glutes and abs. And once the concrete is set, everything else gets stronger. And yes, I know what rebar is because my dad was in construction. Try it again. Fifth position. And... How are five-year-olds better at this than me? This is your second class. You've got to give yourself a break. Yeah, well, the only thing that matters is getting back to my team. What if that doesn't happen? I don't like having to think about that. I think it's good to believe in yourself, but I also think you should have a back-up plan. No. Back-up plans are for people who expect to fail. No, back-up plans are for people who know that even if they do everything right, sometimes things change that they can't control. Is that what happened to you? An injury ended your career, didn't it? I thought this technique of yours worked. No, this technique does work. That's not why I stopped dancing professionally. Then why? Ryan, this is your studio time, Ryan, and we're already behind, so let's not waste it. We're going to combine the moves that you just learned. Plié and glissade. Plié, glissade. Watch me and then try it. Plié. Glissade. Ryan? Come on. Yeah. Remember soft and light. And... A little softer, a little lighter. So, where is Coop? I don't know, in the guest house, I guess. Why? I wanted to introduce him to Matt. You know, you didn't get this excited when I said that you could call me "Matt" instead of "Matthew". Do you really want me to answer that? You should invite him out with us tonight, Jenna. I'm sure he has better things to do. Even if he didn't, I don't think it's a good idea. I have to keep my professional life separate from my personal one. I made that mistake once, and I'm not going anywhere near that road again! I finally have my life back, and I don't want to change a thing. Are you expecting someone? No. Hi. Can I help you? I'm here with the TV. I'm sorry, the what? The TV. Hey, man, no, I told you the guest house in the back. I thought that was the garage? You bought a television? No. I rented a television. You couldn't even live without one for a month? Of course I can, I just didn't want to! Fine. Whatever. And here's my dinner. Thank you. What next with you? A hot tub? That's a great idea. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Coop! What are you doing out there in the cold? Come inside. Yeah, come on in. You look great, by the way. Thank you. Matt, this is Ryan Cooper. Coop, this is my husband, Matt. Hey, Matt. Nice to meet you. Sorry for crashing your dinner. No worries. We were about to head out now anyway, right, ladies? We should probably get going. It's "ice bar" night at Avon winterfest. It's basically a regular bar, outside, made of... Ice. Yeah. I got that. You're welcome to join us. That may not be something he wants to do. Yeah, he probably just wants to stay here and eat himself into a pizza-induced coma. Actually, I would love to come. Great. I can eat pizza in the car. So Matt, what do you do? I'm a real-estate attorney. Yeah, it's pretty boring. Are you into hockey? No. No, I used to play when I was a kid, but, yeah, I don't really have time anymore. Come on, let's go take a look around. Sure. So... Hot drinks, warm clothes, fire tables... This is totally your kind of scene, isn't it? Yeah, well, I am nothing if not consistent. But it is missing one thing. What, the rest of your pizza? No. Hockey. You know, you can go one night without thinking about hockey. Okay. Hey, what about air hockey? Are you even capable of doing anything that doesn't involve a scoreboard? I prefer not to. Well, I probably shouldn't play you in hockey... Air or otherwise. I'll go easy on you. Okay. Let's go. Ladies first. I wasn't ready. That's fine. We'll start over then. Are you hustling me? What? That's absurd. Okay, well, I was taking it easy on you. I didn't ask you to. Well, good, because I'm not going to do it anymore. There it is. Wait, you let me score to make me feel better. Did it work? No! Seriously, how did you get this good? I was on a national tour for a ballet company, and the crew had an air hockey table. Let's just say there was a lot of downtime. You know, you never did say why you went from being a professional dancer to teaching. Hey, word to the wise... Don't play air hockey against Jenna because she is a beast. Yeah. Thanks for the advice. Well, thanks again for the biggest defeat of my entire athletic career. You are so welcome. But seriously... I had one of the best nights I've had in a long time. Thanks for letting me tag along. I'm glad you came. And now I have eternal air hockey bragging rights. I'll see you at class tomorrow. I'll be there. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Okay, second, right here into plié fifth, and relevé up top. It's a pirouette prep. How is it harder to balance on my feet than it is on a thin metal blade on ice? Could you skate the first time you tried? No, it took a while. Yeah, it's the same thing with dance. You're learning something new, it's going to take time. It's always worth doing. How do you even know if this works for hockey? Because before you got here, I did my homework. I spoke with your orthopedic team, and with dance teachers, who do this with athletes from all different kinds of sports. Every single one of their clients said they were more fluid, more dynamic, lighter on their feet, but most importantly, they were injury-free. Injury-free... I almost forgot what that feels like. You're going to be there soon enough. All right, let's go through the sequence again. Start here. Don't worry about the hands. Okay. And we're going to slide into plié fifth, and then relevé up. I'm just glad no one's here to see this. I'm a viral video waiting to happen. Well, I didn't tell anybody you were here, and I don't think Erin did either. Besides, I don't think anybody's going to know it's you. You were saying? You're Ryan Cooper! That's me. What's your name? I'm Felix. Felix, nice to meet you. Hey, don't tell anyone you saw me here, okay? Why not? What's wrong with dance? Nothing, nothing. Nothing. I just... Well, I'm trying to stay under the radar. I don't want other players to know my secret weapon. Felix lives two houses down from me, and he's one of our best dancers. And he plays hockey. More like sits on the bench. Hey, we all spend time on the bench from time to time, bud. Just keep pushing yourself. It's only a matter of time. You'll get to where you want to go. Yeah. You, too. You saw me, huh? Sorry. I was just here a little earlier. I didn't take videos or anything. Thanks. You guys, a little over three weeks until the show. I can count on all of you to come to every single rehearsal, right? Make a full commitment? Yes? Yeah! Yes! All right, let's go! You guys can take your marks. Ella? Hit it. They look great. Wow. That... that was awesome. Felix, wow. You are an incredible athlete. I am? Yeah. It takes real power to be able to jump like that. I'm impressed. Thank you! So much! - Really good job. - Thank you. Three minutes late. But we're getting closer. Yes, it's progress. Go change your shoes. Shoes, right. Yes. Nice shot. It's supposed to get really cold tonight, so I'm going to get you an extra space heater from the barn. I'll come with you. Thanks. So what do you mean by "really cold"? Zero? Okay, try subtracting 60 from that and then we're talking. Where are you from, the north pole? Pretty close. Thunder bay. Northern Canada. It's where I grew up, before we moved again. It's where I learned to love hockey, and decided that I would do... Whatever it takes to become pro. Well, that's why you're here, right? To do whatever it takes to get you back there again. - Hope so. - This way. Thank you. These all you? Yeah. When was this? Four years ago. Why? I think I was at one of your shows! What? I remember taking pictures that night. That's me! That's me. I don't remember taking that photo. Really? I mean, we took a lot of pictures with people. You were the lead dancer, right? The prima ballerina. You are incredible. I remember being blown away by your performance. Thank you. Who's that? That's my ex. We... Started dating right around the time that picture was taken. Sorry. Don't be. After I got hurt, and the spotlight I was always under turned off... So did her heart. You know what, she clearly didn't deserve you. You're gonna find somebody who loves you for more than just playing hockey. That's the thing. I don't know who I am without hockey. Yeah. I said that when I left the ballet. Okay, so what did happen? Yeah, let's just say that dating a co-worker is never a good idea... Especially if that co-worker is your boss. Enough said. Good, because I don't want to talk about it. Let's get this back to your place. Here, let me help you with that. No. Not with that bad ankle. Let's go. Did you hurt your ankle? Yeah, just a little bit. Did you tweak it in our class this morning? No, not in class. I... I went back to the rink afterwards. And? And I got back on the ice. Wait, you what? I wanted to see how it felt, and it felt great, didn't hurt at all. So I pushed myself a little bit, and it still didn't hurt. So I skated drills with the team. What were you thinking? You could've re-torn the ligament! I had to get back out there. It's hard to explain. Ryan, no one understands wanting their life back more than I do. But you have to trust the process. You have to trust me. I do trust you. Well, then quit messing around. Take tomorrow off, and we'll start fresh again on Thursday. - Okay? - Okay. Come on. Good morning. You are up early. I need to talk to you. Yeah, okay. Is everything okay? Okay. So I was meeting with a client yesterday. Jackie Olsen. I love Jackie! Her daughter, Alyssa, is a student of mine. Well, I was going over her expenses, and she mentioned she's looking for ways to save money next year, and she said dance company had another tryout. They're offering a big discount to new dancers. I think she's going to take it. And I don't think she's the only one. Well, if people care about winning competitions, then that's where they should be. What are you going to do? My first instinct is to go back to bed, and when I wake up, maybe it'll be November and everything will be how it was before. Solid plan. Do you want some coffee? Yes. Hi. Hi. Check it out. Right on time. Boom! Yeah, except you were supposed to rest today. Yeah, but my ankle feels fine. I didn't want to waste any more time. No, you said that you would trust me. I don't want you doing anything that would put stress on your ligaments, okay? Okay. Okay, I didn't know me wanting to take my lesson would upset you so much. It's not that. I just have a lot going on with the studio, and... I just took that out on you. I'm sorry. Do you want to take a walk? I don't have class for another hour, so... Yeah, sure. So any idea where a guy can get a decent cup of hot cocoa around here? Yeah, the town square has, like, five different drink carts. You need a hot cocoa, cider, hot toddies... I knew even talking about something "warm and cozy" would put a smile back on your face. Thank you. Thanks. - Better? - Much. Thank you. So what's happening with the dance studio? I just have to get my enrollment numbers back up. You know, I'm sure I can get the Rangers to pay more. Thank you, but that's not a long-term solution. I get that all these dance teams are a trend right now, but... I mean, ballet is not supposed to be about winning or losing. It's a form of self-expression. Sometimes, I think I'm doing the same thing with hockey. I love the game, but... Right now it just feels like it's about winning. When was the last time you played just for fun? I can't even remember the last time I played for fun. Maybe we can do something about that. So what is going on with the studio? Well, right now, my plan is to just get the word out to the community during winterfest, and tell them all about Avon ballet. That's a wonderful idea, but what if it doesn't work? What's your back-up plan? I thought you said back-up plans were for people who expect to fail. Okay, I don't expect you to fail. I... I just care about what happens to you. Thank you. We'll be fine. And for the record, I care about what happens to you, too. This is looking really good, you guys. Awesome! Felix, can we practice your transition in and out of the jump? Yup. Whenever you're ready. That was perfect! This is going to be the best show we've ever done. Enjoying the rest of your day off, I see. Just trying to beat my personal record at puck juggling. So you're bored. So bored. You know, it's funny, because you seem to hang around my door around mealtimes. Like a stray cat. Must be the smell of home cooking. Haven't had that in a long time. Well, if you're bored, you can come inside and I can teach you how to make a really easy healthy meal. Is it healthy nachos? Get inside, mittens. Let's get you some culinary therapy. You just don't seem like the type of person to quit their job over some guy. He wasn't "some guy". Daniel was the creative director of the national ballet theater. I bet no one was allowed to call him "Dan" or "Danny". He hated that. Anyway, we were so in sync for so many years. We were touring the world together, at the top of our game, in love. I mean, everything was perfect. Until... Until... One day in rehearsal, I fell, and I ended up getting the same injury that you have right there. A grade-three high-ankle sprain, with an almost fully-torn ligament. I honestly thought I would just be right back into it a few weeks later, but... It took longer for you to heal than everybody thought. Yep. But I wasn't worried about it. I mean, I knew when I was ready, I would be right back in there as prima ballerina. And I had no doubt that Daniel or the ballet company would be as loyal to me as I had been to them. I'm going to take a wild guess that they weren't. Yeah. I was replaced by my understudy. And then, a year later, I found out that she was engaged to Daniel. I was just completely pushed aside. That one injury changed everything. But, you know, it was out of my control, so I just had to adapt. You make it sound so easy. No. It... it wasn't. But, you know, in the end, I ended up realizing that it was for the better. It's funny, because I came back to Avon to fix this property up to sell it. I ended up falling in love with it all over again. And I didn't regret that decision until... Until? You know, I don't understand how people can just walk away from things so easily. And this time from my studio. It's just really disappointing. Yeah, I kind of feel the same way about my team. If I don't get back there soon, they might not be there for me anymore. You're going to be okay, Coop. No matter what. You too. Do you want some dessert? Let me handle that. Meet me outside in 10 minutes. Okay. What is this? Well, you took care of dinner, so I'm taking care of dessert. - S'mores night! - S'mores night! Thank you. Guys, we haven't done this in so long! Here you go. Thank you! Did you guys help him set this up? Nope. This was all him. Pretty sweet of him, huh? It is very sweet of him. Who knew? Take a marshmallow. Thank you. That's a beauty. Give it a go. Yeah? Well, so you do know a thing or two about hockey. Maybe a little. Where did you play? It was a long time ago. But I had to stop. You got hurt? No, my dad died. I was the only one who could take over his business. So... Yeah, I was actually a couple days away from getting drafted into the NHL. I guess me being here kind of pours salt in the wounds. At first, maybe. But... I mean, I know you worked your tail off to get to where you are. I respect that. I respect what you did more... Sacrificing your future for your family. Thanks, man. Yeah. Who invented the s'more? Oddly enough, it was my distant cousin from Toronto, "Bob s'Moore". That is so not true. It was the girl scouts. Believe what you want... Hi, guys! Hey! What are you doing here? We saw the fire on the way home, wanted to make sure everything was okay. Yeah, we're just making s'mores. Here, you want some? Felix, how was your hockey game? We won... But I barely got on the ice. They didn't let you play? They did... But every time I got the puck, I just couldn't hold onto it. Hey, Felix, I know a really great coach here in town, and I think he's available tomorrow. Is that okay, dad? Sure. Matt, you mind giving me a ride to the rink? Yeah, no worries. We'll pick you up at seven. What's that all about? You'll see. You know what, guys, this firewood is getting low. Let me go grab some from the barn. I'll give you a hand. Thank you. I'm gonna run by you. Thanks. Oh, boy. Who wants a mallow? You know, this is such a great space. You ever think about fixing this barn up, teaching your classes in here? That way, you wouldn't have to worry about rent. You'd be in complete control. I know. I tried, but this is a 200-year-old barn. It's not up to code, and it would cost a fortune to convert. My dad tried years ago, when he wanted to make this place a cider mill. - Really? - Yeah. He wanted a tasting room, a store, the whole thing. That's a... That's a wonderful dream. I'm just sad he didn't get to see it through. But you could. If anyone can do it, it's you. Come on, how do you know that? I mean, we barely know each other. Actually, you know me better than almost anyone else. I guess you know me better than almost anyone else. The fire's almost out. I guess we better get back out there. Hey, Felix, help me with this firewood. All right. This is going to be awesome. So, what exactly is happening here? Well, Felix needs help, and I can't go on the ice, so I need you to do it. I... I don't have any skates. I'm a professional hockey player. I never leave home without at least three extra pairs. And lucky for you... We are basically the same size. I... I haven't been on the ice in years. You'll be fine. It's like riding a bicycle... Except the bicycle has sharp metal blades on the bottom. Ready? Well... Wish me luck. Hey! Good job! Okay, Felix, show me what you got. Incredible footwork, Felix. Yeah, amazing agility. Yeah, until I get the puck. Let's see. Come on, come on. You're up right here. Ready? Hey. That's not as hard a fix as you think. You're just squeezing that stick too tight. All right, you gotta keep those shoulders loose, those arms. Let that top hand do most of the work, all right? Listen to the man. He knows what he's talking about. I'll give it a try. A tip that helped me when I was your age... Think of a nonsense word and say it over and over again. What kind of word, though? My personal favorite... "Flump". - Never failed me. - "Flump"? All right, let's try it. Flump. Flump! Flump! Yeah! Nice shot, Felix! Hey, guys, look who's here. - Flump! - Good job, Felix! Flump! I am very proud of you for staying off of the ice. Well, I am not about to mess this up. I haven't seen you smile like this in such a long time. It's all part of Coop's master plan. Thank you, Coop. Now there's no excuse not to watch the Rangers' game with me. - Totally. - Yes! All right, let's get back out there. You know, the only reason I said you couldn't lace up is because you pushed yourself way too hard last time. But... You know, if you promise to take it easy... It might be helpful to see how your ankle is feeling. But the key words are "take it easy". Okay? Thank you! Take it easy! Good job, you guys! Awesome! You looked really good out there. How does your ankle feel? - It feels great! - Yeah? No pain at all. That's so good! This is the critical part. You're getting the strength you need, now you just have to build on that to prevent re-injury. Well, you look like you're having a lot of fun. I haven't had that much fun in years. Can we keep playing? It's getting late and there's an ice storm coming in. We should all head home. Okay. Thank you so much, Matt. And you, too, Coop. Anytime, bud. Hey, you think if I keep doing ballet, I can be as smooth on my cuts as you? Definitely. We can take you home, Felix. Thanks. You know, you are a really good person, Ryan Cooper. I just saw a way of helping them both at the same time. And you inspire people. Not everyone can do that. That figures. Hey. Are you guys out, too? Yeah, well, you know what that means... Power outage game night! Okay, can you get over here safely? I'll see you guys soon. Bye. That was fast! Okay... I know my life is "all about ice," but even for me, that is a bit much. You should not have walked over here in this. It's slippery out there. You could have tweaked your ankle. Hey, I wanted to make sure you were okay. Yes, yeah, thank you. I... I have my fireplace for heat, and a gas stove, and storm snacks. Storm snacks... That's not a thing. Oh, it so is. Ballet dancers eat junk food! That's what I've been trying to tell you. I realized living an "all or nothing" existence isn't living at all. Then why aren't you expanding your dance studio? Because... That's just... That's different. - Can I get some of that? - Yeah. Hey! We brought the poker set. Okay, that is so not fair. You know I can't bluff to save my life. But Ryan doesn't know that. You should invite him over. Come on. Everyone can see how you two look at each other! Just admit there's something going on! Stop. Hey, Coop. Hi. Matt. Okay. Who invited this guy? Well, it's just you and me, Wagner. What're you going to do? I'm all in. You have the worst "tell" I have ever seen. What? I have no idea what you're talking about. Really? Okay. I call. I had eights! So... What do I win? "Power outage poker" bragging rights. - That's it? - Yes, that's it. I guess I can live with that. I can't believe how late it is. Yeah? Oh, yeah. We should get home to start the generator... Because the power could be out for hours. Are you sure it's safe to walk? Oh, please. We're not newbies. We brought the crampons. We'll be fine. Well, I guess I should get going, too. Wolf Pack has conditioning all morning. Assuming the roads get opened. Yeah, and I have my make-up rehearsal for winterfest. I'll get you my crampons. No! I left those at the studio. I'm sure I'll be fine. Absolutely not. If you slip and get hurt, I will never forgive myself. Well, I'm not sure what else to do besides sleeping on your couch till morning. Yeah, that's fine. Well, except with the power out, the living room is the only one with heat, so I was going to sleep on the couch, too, but technically, it's two separate couches, so, I mean, it's fine. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. So do all your guests get this level of service? Yes. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hello? Wait, what? Are you serious? Okay. All right, just keep me updated when you hear more. All right, bye. Morning. What's wrong? A power line went down in front of the studio, so now I can't get in, which means another rehearsal is canceled, so we are two days behind. Well, I've seen the dancers practicing on their own. They know the routine. I know, but the difference between a good performance and a great one is being so prepared, the dance is second nature. Well, there's nothing you can do about it. And I'm sure they'll call if something changes. You know, why don't you come to the rink with me today? It's about time you saw a bit of my world. I've spent a lot of time in yours. I'd love that. Where is everybody? Practice is canceled. If practice is canceled, what are we doing here? Like I said, I wanted you to see how I spend the other half of my day, and I thought... I could show you how I destress. You conned me? I thought it was my turn to teach you something for once. Ryan, I didn't say I don't know how to ice skate. I said I didn't like it. Well, that's not all we're doing. That's it, just keep leaning forward. You're doing great! I can't stop... I can't stop! I got you. Okay... Just follow my lead. You saved me. You saved me. Is your ankle feeling better? I'm not talking about my ankle. The rink is a great place to destress. The cool air, the sound of blades on the ice... What do you think? It's amazing. - Oh, ho! - Oh, yeah! - Yeah! - Come on! Yes! Can you hold this? Hey, main street's clear! I'm going to be able to do the one o'clock class after all. Come on. I'm going to hang these flyers around the neighborhood before my class gets here. I can help. Okay. Let's go. - I'll get this. - Thanks. Unbelievable. What? We were supposed to be the grand finale, but the dance company must've talked to the organizers because now they're performing last. Sounds like they're pulling a power play. Do you really think so? Yup, but just like in hockey, don't let it fluster you, defend your house, and when it's your turn... Make it count. You know, I'm going to do that. Thank you. Who knew that hockey and ballet were so similar? Come on. Hey, Felix, we're meeting up at the rink, do you want to play? Can't. I have dance. Hey, Felix! - So what's up? - Hey, Coop. You're Ryan Cooper. What are you doing here? A little dance rehab for my ankle. A lot of pro athletes are doing it now because ballet is a total thing. In fact, Felix has better footwork than me because of it. Okay, guys, let's get to class. See you guys later. You know, maybe this doesn't need to be a one-off. What do you mean? Helping me. Why not make athletic training part of what your studio has to offer? It could be big business. I could set you up with meetings with all the major trainers on the east coast. I appreciate that, but I just don't think that's the right direction for me or my studio. Okay, you don't want to do dance competitions, you're not open to athletic training. I'm going to tell you what Terry told me. You gotta do something because you're running out of options. Right, but training people to win trophies is literally the exact opposite of my philosophy. Well, like I had to learn to be more flexible to reach my goal, maybe you need to learn to bend a little, too. - Let's go to class. - Okay. Going to bring it in. Very nice. Really pretty, really pretty. Watch your spacing, watch your spacing. Great! - That's it, Felix! - Yeah, yeah. - He's through. - There it is, there it is. Felix is looking great out there. Yeah, he just needed a few small adjustments. Well, you were the first person to explain it in a way that made sense to him. I already talked to the other parents. A lot of the locals remember how close you came to going pro. Man, it just wasn't in the cards. Maybe coaching is. We still need a new head coach in the spring. I appreciate the offer, John. I will think about that. Okay. You know, Matt, there are always a million reasons to say no, but if you find the courage to say yes... Great things can happen. Hey, Coop. We're short for a quick 4-on-4 drill. What do you say? I was just here for a physical. Which you passed with flying colors. You are so ready to take that ankle out for an all-out spin. Get out there. - All right! - All right! Let 'er rip, Coop! Yes! You were amazing out there! Yeah, it felt great. I'm not even sore. I knew you'd get there. Yeah, and there's one more lesson to spare, so. So, what happens now that you passed your physical? Well, I start practicing with the Wolf Pack full-time, and just wait for the Rangers to call me back up. How long will that be? No idea. I mean... it could be a while. Well, the guest house is yours as long as you want it. Thanks. If you're not too tired, tonight's the last night of winterfest before the big performance tomorrow. Do you want to go? I'd love to. Okay. What? Your favorite TV show? I don't know. I was always dancing. Come on. Let's go say hi. Or... We could leave them alone. Thanks a lot. I'm rubbing off on you. You know, I think you need these. And I think you need these. - I'm getting them. - I'm getting these. - Thank you! - Thank you. Madame. You're so very welcome. Thank you! Jenna, I... Jenna. Terry! I didn't even know you were coming up! I've been looking all over for you guys. Hi! Terry, what're you doing here? Well, I'm just coming back from a meeting in Boston. I figured I'd come get you on the way back. Get me? For what? You obviously haven't seen this yet, have you? Somebody posted this online? Yeah, and a lot of people saw it, too... Including coach Jackson. Just had a conference call with him, the Wolf Pack coach and the orthopedic team you met with. And? And they see no reason to wait. Pending one last physical with the team doctors, they think you're ready to practice again with the team in New York... And have you back on the active roster soon after. Are you serious? That's amazing! I told them I'd bring you back tonight. Tonight? Yeah, coach wants to meet with you first thing in the morning, get the physical done, and then back on the ice in the afternoon. That's... That's really soon. You made this possible, Jenna. Thank you! I am so happy for you. Terry, could you give us a minute? Of course. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's right. I couldn't have done this without you. I'm just sorry you're going to miss the show. Jenna, I really, really wish I could be there. Hey, stop. This is way more important. Well, maybe I can talk to Terry, he can talk to coach, I can get an extra day. You can't do that. This is what you came here for. And now you're back on the team. This is everything you wanted. Of course you have to go. I just really wish we had more time. It was only ever supposed to be 30 days. We both knew that. And now that time is up. Hey, Terry, can you give Ryan a ride back to my place? Sure. You're not coming with? You know, I just have so much to do at the studio before tomorrow. But, hey... You're going to be great! Thank you. Good luck. Hey. Go get 'em, Coop. Jenna! Did you know Ryan's playing today? What? I thought he was only going to start practicing with them. Apparently not. And the score remains two-all. We're 15 seconds into overtime with a tied game... Don't you want to watch him? I have to get ready for the show. Heading into the far corner, and, oh, my, Cooper headed toward the net. He takes a shot, he scores! He scored! He scored! Ryan Cooper wins the game for the Rangers in overtime! - Way to go, Coop. - Unbelievable! You okay? Of course I am. I'm happy for him. He's doing what he was meant to do, and so am I. But can't you find a way to make this work? This is what he wanted. Well, at first, maybe, but now I think he wants a little more of what he found here. I just want him to be happy. What about you? I'm really going to miss him. Oh, honey. And here's your first star in your New York Rangers... Ryan Cooper! You looked 10 years younger out there, Coop. Glad to have you back. Thank you. Hey, do you mind if I skip the press conference? Why? You have somewhere else to be? Funny you should ask. Okay, you guys, we're up next. I want you to go out there and have fun. You already put in all the hard work. The rest will take care of itself. Okay? Hey, Jenna. Hi, mayor Andreen. Are the kids ready to go on? Yes, they absolutely are. You know, everyone in town is talking about how you got Ryan Cooper back to the NHL. Really? I didn't think that many people knew he was here. Are you kidding? Of course we did. We just didn't want to bug the man. You know, my son's football team heard from some of the hockey kids that ballet training would give them more agility on the field and help them win more games. But ballet isn't really about winning. - Hi! - Hi. I have so much to say to you. I thought we said everything that needed to be said. We didn't say anything that needed to be said. Ryan Cooper, you're here! Ryan, this is mayor Andreen. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Pleasure's all mine. Are you going to be a part of the show now? Well, I'm not officially a member of the company. Yes, you are. You worked just as hard as everyone else. Well, I would if I knew the routine. But if you don't mind... May I introduce them? The mic's all yours. Thank you. Let's go. Good evening. I'm Ryan Cooper. Coop! Thanks. You know, it was nice to hear that again my first game back. And I wouldn't have been there if it wasn't for my incredible teacher... Jenna Wagner. Opening myself up to ballet not only made me a better athlete, it made me a more humble, more flexible, and more balanced person. And Jenna showed me... That even if I never play pro hockey ever again... Which I fully plan on doing by the way... ...that I don't have to fear my future, because, no matter what happens, I know I'll be okay... Because of her. I almost forgot the most important thing I learned... Yes! Now "for the love of dance"... The incredible Avon ballet studio. So good. You guys, I am so proud of you. That was the best show you've ever done. Excuse me, Mr. Cooper, would you mind signing an autograph for my son? Yeah, of course. There you go. Can we talk somewhere more private? - Yeah. - Yeah. I have to ask, how did you make it here so quickly? I took the owner's helicopter. Of course you did. Well, I'm really glad you could make the show. That's not the only reason I'm here. Well, I thought getting back to the team was all you wanted. It was... Until I met you. Don't you have to get back to your real life? This is more real than anything in New York or any place else. Yeah, right. Plus, there's no rule that says I have to stay in New York during the off-season. Those moments together, off the ice, being close with you... That is what life is all about. I believe in Denmark they have a word for it. What is it? Yeah, "hygge". You actually said it right. I know you've been hurt by people who are here one minute, gone the next, but I swear, I will never do that to you. Nothing's going to change how I feel about you. And when I'm not playing hockey, I will always come back. I just... Need to know if you want me to. I want that. More than anything in the world. I love you, Jenna Wagner. I love you, Ryan Cooper.
