Once upon a time... there was a city without a voice. Somebody had taken away the voices of all its inhabitants. Many, many years went by and nobody seemed bothered by the silence.

FROM OUR STUDIOS IN THE CITY WITHOUT A VOICE TV FOODS presents THE ONE AND ONLY THE VOICE On the air To be a star and to shine in a sky of a thousand eyes... and a bridge of ego to climb... in the sea of praise. Make of my body a voice in the mute light of a tale. A thousand candles lit at night In the gentle murmur of your dreams. You must find your place... In my fragile digital world. Will you be just another one or a zero of hope? FIRED OUT!!! You've been fired. We lost a balloon man. A problem with... I'll talk to MY FATHER. Father Did you deliver the envelope? Is that the only thing you care about? It was the only thing you had to do right. Mummy, are you there? Shhh! Don't speak if you aren't sure. Someone might overhear you. It's dangerous. Very dangerous. My love, take care of your voice as if it were a treasure. I'm sorry, Mum. I've brought dinner. Did you receive a letter today? With a... secret surprise? No. I didn't get any letters. I've brought you dinner. Your FATHER doesn't know how to look after you. I know how to look after myself, mum. REPAIRED Shh! It's time to sleep now. Mummy? Yes, my love? The secret surprise is my eyes, isn't it? Shhh! Don't speak so loudly. You'll be overheard. Besides, revealing a surprise... calls for bad luck. I'm Ana, I live across the street. I have a LETTER for you. The letter hasn't arrived yet, Mr TV. My STUPID son! It doesn't matter... I have a copy in a place NEARBY. TO THE BOXING RING! If I'm not home, I'm in the house across the street. Ana. What are you doing here?! This is Tom?s, my new friend. POOR THING. I feel desperate living without your love... I am resigned to waiting in grief. I feel such anguish escaping from myself... that I have written... these words for you. Come. I am waiting for you here. Come. I don't want to tell you again. That it's all over now. That desire has failed. But time has brought me back to you. I need your help. I went to the boxing ring today... and I saw your father... taking away the woman... who sings on TV. THE VOICE They took her to the hospital. My FATHER has gone mad. I have seen him speaking to himself. The VOICE My FATHER has a secret. I HATE him. I need money for a bribe. WASTE I can't believe you called me. Neither can I. The money. She's my ex-wife. It's that way. In Dr. Y's office. I'll open the door for you. Restricted Area Ready for the test, Mr. TV. Begin, Dr. Broadcasting Image Broadcasting Audio END YOU'VE FAILED DR.! HE WAS SUPPOSED TO FALL ASLEEP! I think we need to reduce the power of the machine... TAKE HIM AWAY! FATHER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! SEARCH THE PLACE! LOCK HIM UP FOREVER. Split up. CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! OUT!!! sorry You aren't going to spoil my PLANS. The only thing that can stop us... is a second VOICE What are you talking about? She is the VOICE. The only one. What about her son? The boy without eyes? It's very RISKY. If the child has the voice... and is able to broadcast it... he will counteract the power of the machine. The gift may be hereditary. I don't think so, Dr. I want the machine to broadcast... during the BOXING match. Take care of the boy without eyes. KILL HIM! I know the boy without eyes. He is with Ana. This is my room. Bed. Window. Dolls. Blackboard. Door. Trunk. Table. Lamp. Chair. Ana. Wardrobe. Mirror. Ana. You have a VOICE! You can SPEAK! Shhh! Don't tell anybody. It's a secret I have to keep. Don't worry. Silence is hereditary. LOOK FOR THE BOY! GET MOVING! BRING HIM TO ME! We didn't find anything. IDIOTS! SEARCH THE SURROUNDING AREA! Don't let go of me. MUMMY! Mummy, are you there? Mummy, mummy? Mummy, are you there? You have a VOICE! You can SPEAK! Have you seen my Mummy? I'm Ana's father. I have an idea. The boy has a VOICE. It is a second VOICE. If the child has the voice... and is able to broadcast it... he will counteract the power of the machine. But... how? How can it be broadcast? What's that? SOME BLUEPRINTS that I've stolen from the TV station. They are from an old voice broadcasting station. The Aerial This place still exists. THE AERIAL is hidden up in the mountains. And it has been abandoned for years. Do you think the equipment still works? You'll have to REPAIR IT. Your mother gave me this. "Imagination has saved men..." We can still save ourselves. They have taken our voices... but we still have words. STOP THEM! DAD! NO! KILL THE OLD MAN! GRANDAD! Hold on tight! SHOOT! DAMN YOU! The old man had this on him. They are heading to THE AERIAL. We will meet again soon. They have taken our voices... but we still have words. We're running out of resources, Mr. TV. I know. The voices are not enough. At midnight tomorrow... we will BROADCAST. At last, we will get what we want from the city. I'll be waiting... THE AERIAL Stay here. Don't be too long. I'll start a FIRE. I miss my Mummy. Don't worry. She's going to be alright. You'll see.
