Gaius Caesar, the most depraved, cruel and treacherous Roman emperor, popularly known as Caligula, because of the caligia, the little soldier's boots he wore as a child. He murdered his adoptive grandfather, Tiberius, and assumed power. Nothing restrained him. He committed incest with his sisters, adultery with friends' wives, pederasty, flaunted the law, mocked the Senate, glutton, pervert, epileptic, paranoid and insomniac. This is his story. You hairless dog. No, Ulmar, wait. So Domitius, your sword is as ineffectual as your pen. You were worthless as a poet and you're worthless as an assassin. I could have written my masterpiece in your blood, Caligula. Go ahead and kill me. I am not afraid of death. Who mentioned death? No Domitius, you will live. You will bear witness to the history I shall create. And in your mind, you will compose verses full of hatred and madness, verses that you will never be able to write or recite. Guards! Cut the tendons in his arms and the legs, and tear out his tongue. And if he dies I'll have your heads. We should ride here more often Gaius. It strengthens the horses' legs, improves their wind. This is where it happens, every night, the same dream. Caesar, dreams are not reality. Reality is another dream. It was a dream that revealed to my mother Tiberius' plot to have her killed. She was killed, the beach red with blood, fragments of human bodies scattered everywhere. Well, Caesar, as long as they're dreams there's little to worry you. And Ulmar, your slave, has sworn to shield you from the dangers of the real world. Every man has a price, I haven't discovered his. Look, Caeser. I'll wager that a few minutes with one of those innocent beauties could dispel your anxiety. Oh look, there are soldiers coming. Delightful, all of them. Aren't they Messala? They are the fruits of your reign Caeser, And ripe for the plucking, especially her. What's your name? Livia. Come here. A fish, strange amulet. What does it mean? It's the symbol of a new religious sect that started in Palestine. I thought Rome has more than enough gods as it is. Are you a Jew? No. Then why don't you worship the god of the Romans? Do you know who is the God that you must worship? I asked you a question. You are that god, Divine Caesar. Forgive her, please I beg you. She's like a frightened lamb. What could be more exciting than the lamb ready for the sacrifice? Careful, Gaius I know that lad. He's the son of consul, Marcus Tullius Cicero He has a lot of power. No, don't. Why not? Because it's not the right moment, and when it does happen, I want it to be beautiful. I'll wait, and I know I'll want you forever. Well, why have you stopped? You looked so charming. It was you who stopped him, wasn't it? You're right. To give the jewel of your virginity to a clumsy bumbling child would be like presenting hogs to the death. You'd do better to give it to a man, and better still to a God. No! How dare you? On your knees. Leave us. No, let him stay, and watch. You might learn something. No, please. Gaius, look out! No, no! Livia, Livia! Kill him. Kill him! Who did it? Who murdered my son? A group of religious fanatics who call themselves Christians. The emperor Gaius has ordered those responsible to be caught and punished. The noble Messala is dealing with the crime himself. What makes Caesar so certain that these religious fanatics are to blame for it? Your son had their symbol, he was holding it in his hand. Why are you doing this? What harm have we done to you? Shut up, old man, out of my way. They're hiding in the cross tunnels, it'll be impossible to get them all out. Never mind, we only need five or six of them. Should we put them in prison? No, they've already been tried and sentenced. To take them out the avian way and crucify them. Domitius has been arrested. Did he betray us? I doubt it. Well, by now not one of us would have his head on his shoulders. Did they kill him? No. They cut the tendons of his arms and legs tore out his tongue, poor devil. Gaius is mad, a bloodthirsty lunatic and we put him on the throne. We simply respected the will of Tiberius. Tiberius was demented as well. We are now paying the price of his insanity. How long will we have to put up with it? For as long as he wants because he believes himself to be a God. No, Gaius Caesar must die quietly. Oh, that's a brilliant proposal Marcellus Agrippa, but how will you carrying it out? I'll find a way. Miriam, please don't leave me ever. Of course not. Why would you think I would ever want to leave you? You promise that? I promise. We'll never be separated. Miriam, please let us bury Livia according to our Christian practice. No, her body is to be cremated according to the law of my gods. She was a Christian. You are welcome to stay with your good and kind God who was unable to defend her. But let me listen to my God who speaks of vengeance. And here's the imperial palace, 200 large rooms. And on those terraces, we plan a number of swimming pools with many fountains, surrounded by gardens which will surpass in beauty, the famed gardens of ancient Babylon. Well, my friends, what do you say? Let me hear your opinions. It will be more magnificent than Olympus itself. Truly sublime. And worthy of your greatness. Marcellus Agrippa. I don't hear your voice join the bleating of these sheep. How much will all this cost Caesar? If I'm permitted to ask. What a prosaic turn of mind you have. Marcellus, you disappoint me. As usual of course. Here am I showing you a work of art such as the world has never seen. Something eternal, something immortal, something that will link forever the names of Rome and Gaius Caesar Germanicus. And you speak prices. Has the empire a price? I will sacrifice all my personal treasure. I will put everything I have up for auction to fulfill this project. The auction will take place at a magnificent banquet that I will give it the palace. Marssala, you will take charge of organizing it to, and invite all our dearest friends, the governors of the provinces, the foreign nobility. In other words, anyone with enough money to afford the price of admission. After all, I feel certain that no one will want to offend Gaius Caesar by refusing to participate. But will do you invite ladies worthy of your guests? The women will be well worth the price of admission. You will be given exotic rarities and novices, novices recruited from the Virgin maidens of the goddess Vesta. Caesar, the vessels are holy priestesses. They have to take a vow of virginity. They'll have to choose another livelihood. Besides, I don't think the goddess Vesta will be too offended if another God asks a small personal favor, or would you prefer that I asked this small personal favor of your wives and daughters? Fine, since we're all obviously in agreement, have some wine brought in and we'll drink to it. To your project to witness to your munificence. You drink to your own cowardice Terchous Arias, and to the hope that one day a blade will disembowel me or that my cup of wine will be poisoned. Perhaps this very one I'm about to drink from. You don't believe that really, do you Caesar? No? Very well my faithful friend. I will drink your wine, and you will drink mine. We can be certain that yours isn't poisoned. Well, what are you waiting for, drink. Go on. Drink! All right, that's enough. Even if it weren't poisoned, you'd die of fright. My wine is better guarded than your wives private parts. Now Demitrius, to work. I want the basic structures laid down in time for... Out of the way, leave him alone, bring some hot water. Try to vomit Caesar, vomit Caesar. Your wine was poisoned. Come on, vomit, vomit Caesar. Come on boy, vomit. Come on. Omnipotent gods, I beg you to take my life in place of our beloved emperors. Come on, that's it, keep trying. Oh mighty Jupiter, if you spare our Caesar's life, I vow to give all I posses for the construction of a temple in your honor. Thank you friends. The gods have heeded your prayers. The heartbreaking sincerity of your pleas has brought about the miracle. Marius, I will take care of the temple. Lucretius will come to you tomorrow to estimate the value of your estate. As for you, I was so moved by your declaration of faith, that I will gladly satisfy your wish immediately. Thank you mighty Caesar. Seize him, and hold him still. Do you realize what you're doing? Do I realize? He offered his life, didn't he? Let him give it then. And now, out of here. All of you, get out! I will create. An eternal city. Sublime work of art beyond mortal conception. Come. Look at him, Clizia, look at him. He's not much to look at, I know, but he's still a man. Or what's left of one. You see, nothing of him works anymore. Except his brain and that, that still works. I guarantee you. Except the poor thing, he can't even masturbate anymore. Sweet Clizia. Why don't you take pity on him and lend him a helping hand? Go on. Make him, make him enjoy himself. Stop, stop! You're committing a sacrilege. Get out of the way, we're following the emperors orders. Ulmar, would you like to play with me? No, sorry, my lady, but I'm not allowed to. Oh come on, you know Gaius would give you permission. You just need to ask him. My job is to protect the life of our emperor and not to screw up a common slut. I warned you Clizia. Ulmar can't be moved. Except by Gaius in person. Isn't that right Ulmar? Tell me Petraeus. How did Gaius come by that slave? Of all the gladiators in the Nordic lands, Ulmar was the best. Caligula chose him as his personal bodyguard. Doesn't he trust his Praetorian's anymore? The Praetorian's watchful eyes are more on their pay than on the emperor. Gaius has his faults, but stupidity is not one of them. Ulmar is of slave now but in his own land he was a prince. Next one over here, let me see your teeth dear. Over there. Next. Julia Queentha. Be here tomorrow, this hour. Over there. Here are the vestals. Take them in dear boy. Next. Come on. Oh no, you won't do at all. You'll make everyone vomit before dinner. Please let me come, I need the money and I'm very good at all the tricks and I've had lots of experience. Well I suppose I could use you for something but not with the men. With what? Dogs and horses. All right. Over there. Next. Oh yes, you'll do, over there. Come back tomorrow, this time. Thank you. Miriam Chelsea. Miriam Chelsea. All right, return tomorrow at this same hour. Miriam. All mighty Lord of life and death, prince of the night I offer you my purity so that I may complete my vengeance. My poor girl. Your sacrifice was useless. Even if you can get close to Caligula, how do you expect to kill him, with what means? I can only do my best Cornelius. Men, who were stronger and more determined than you have lost their lives trying. If you truly want to avenge Livia, trust me. Let me help you. It is my job to train you so that you may provide the greatest possible pleasure for the emperor's guests. Some of you may think that you have no need of instruction, that you are already sufficiently skilled in the arts of love, except for those who have yet to feast on the honey of men's desires. But remember this, while it is natural and instinctive for a woman to let a man possess her, it is not instinctive for her to possess him, to possess him in such a way that the pleasure you provide will make him your slave. Come Imos. Imos is a Greek slave. He will provide the raw material for your studies. Now let me see, who shall we begin with. You. Aren't you lucky to have such a fine specimen of Helenic virality to work on? Now girls I want you to watch the proceeding with care and attention but with warmth and passion to. You must identify with your companion and participate with her in the pleasure she is giving. You should make the first advances dear, in case your partner happens to be shy. You can draw him out of himself by gentle, delicate manipulation. There's no need to be in a hurry, gradually, warm up slowly so that every part of his physical being feels the touch of your caressing fingers and tingles with the desire for satisfaction. Now you have reached the focus of his desire where a man concentrates all his fears and his needs. His spiritual home. Not only his body but his soul in your mouth, and you can hold him there until you exhaust him, he'll never stop you. He will let himself be destroyed, you have possessed him because he is vanquished, because he is over powered. Yield to his desire now, yield. Now you have to bow to his strength. Open yourself to him, open yourself now dear, let him in. Take his hands, kiss them. All right now stop. I said stop. Go back to your place. Let me see. You, Miriam, come here. Hail Caesar. Welcome my dear friends. I am so happy to see you all here. Enjoying yourselves? Have fun. Hail Caesar. Oh, how wild. Oh, did he frighten you? Yes. You might as well spare him. You like living here in Rome, don't you? Oh yes. Yes, climate's good but the traffics chaotic. Very much. Nice brown Nubian, let's have a cup of wine together, come on. No, let go of me, I don't want to. Listen, I paid to come here. I'm not for sale, you pig. You wild cat, come here. Ulmar. Leave me alone. Who do you think you are, an Prussian? I'm gonna get my money's worth now come on you bitch before I have you flogged. Hey, what is this? What is your name? Miriam, divine Caesar. Here Miriam. Wonderful performer, watch. Such sensitivity little Miriam. I like it. Ulmar. Gaius Caesar commands me to take you to him at once. You're very beautiful. Aren't you afraid? Why should I be? It would only take one word from me, and this lovely head of yours would be rolling on the carpet. What would you do with it? Your empire is full of heads that could be struck off for much better reason. Give me one reason why I shouldn't begin with yours? Planning a little trip, Agrippa? Only my family. I was going to stay here in Rome. Of course. I'm aware of your courage and your nobility. Nothing disturbs you, does it Agrippa? Even death has never frightened you. A new baby? A pretty child. Is it a boy? Yes. A little Agrippa. A tender, helpless thing right now. But a sure plotter and assassin tomorrow. Better to nip the challenge in the bud. No! Please stop it, stop it. Slowly, slowly, don't let them die. I want them to suffer. Please, don't make him suffer any longer. Caesar, I beg of you. I beg of you Caesar! Torture me if you must! And now their families. Gaius you go to far with such an order. To murder those who are innocent? Innocent? There are no innocents among Caligula's subjects. No one is innocent. Not one of you in this room is innocent. Even if you had no part in the plot I should have you all killed. Messala, slaughtering innocence is no soldiers duty. It should be done by frightened old men, men who cling to life like a baby to it's mothers nipple. Caesar you are speaking to senators of Rome and our honor deserves... Your honor is rotten and stinks worse than your fatted breath. And will not stop you from giving a demonstration of your infamy here and now because you will be the ones to carry out the sentence. Bring the wife and daughter of Agrippa. Give him your sword. Ulmar, if he refuses to obey kill him. Now noble Heriot, the choice is yours. If you do not kill these women their lives will be spared, but you will die instantly. Look at them. The wife and daughter of Marcellus Agrippa. He was a good friend of yours I believe. Kill me if you like but don't kill her, please don't. Be merciful, spare my daughter. Ulmar kill him. No. No. That's enough, that's enough Careas. You've given ample proof of your honor. Bring me the wife and children of Catalus. What do you want? Your friends have all been killed. They weren't my friends, and I saved the emperor's life. Gratitude is a quality of unknown two Gaius. His lust for blood will drive him to any crime or reckless folly. And by staying here, you'll surely be running a great risk. How could I leave? Look, there are guards everywhere. I know a way to get you out of the palace. Then I can arrange for you to leave Rome for a safe hiding place. But you'd be risking your life. Cesar would never forgive you if he found out. Why are you willing to risk your life for me? Because when you finally decide to do what you are planning, it is I who must prevent it. And I have no wish to kill you. The gods themselves would grow pale at the sight of so much blood. Petreius, how much do you hate me? Hate you? You're wrong Gaius, I do not hate you, strange as it may seem. But I see the full extent of your cruelty, perversion, and confusion. Really? Does the sight of blood upset you. Did you never kill when you fought in my fathers legion? Any man who died beneath my sword died in battle. Such modesty Petreius, I envy you. Because modesty is the only feeling I will never know. It's not me you envy little boots, it's the gods. Divine power, that's what you really desire. But remember mighty Caesar, divine powers most manifest in creation, not in destruction. Is there such a difference between creation and destruction? As for envying the gods I feel like, to a man who loves power, the rivalry for gods does have it's slight flavor of provocation. But today I showed them that a man can do their work every bit as well as they can, if he's not afraid to try. That is blasphemy. No, it's a revelation. The only way to be the equal of the gods is to be their match in cruelty. Then the impossible is possible. Do you think as the rest of them do, that I'm an insane murderer? A monster? Yes Gaius. Then why didn't you let them kill me? I don't know. I do. And it's the same reason why I'm not going to Kill you. They're beautiful, much too beautiful for me. No, they're nothing, they mean nothing. But you, have given me a meaning for the first time. You give me something I can't understand, or deny, or resist. Can't I make you understand? The woman is a slave, the emperor of Rome cannot marry a slave. No law will permit... No law can rise above my will. I am the law. Messala, order the finest portrait sculptors in the land to work on Miriam's likeness in the purest, whitest marble. And let them be ready, for our wedding day. Miriam. Miriam? Miriam! Miriam! Come. Miriam. What shall I do? Have you forgotten what I told you to do? No. No? Then leave while you still have time. No. You still want to kill him? No, I couldn't do it now, but I've got to know the truth. Then let the gods perform their will. Miriam. Please forgive me. Clizia. I had to do it, I couldn't let him go on living like that. Forgive me Gaius. Do you really need all that wine? I dreamed my death and yours. I was lost. Dreams don't kill. No, but they can make you suffer. They create tortures worse than real ones. No control, no power. Even an emperor has no power over his own dreams. Not even the power to wake up. Why did you run away? Because of this. What does it mean? The girl who wore it around her neck, Livia, do you remember her. I don't know what you're talking about. You killed her didn't you? No, it's not true. I didn't kill her, what's happening to me? Wine, wine. Something in wine. Don't be afraid, you won't die. Why, it was you, why? I have to know, sleep Caligula and remember. No. Caligula, don't go on, stop. Petreius. Where are you? Caligula. Miriam, wait. No Gaius, come back. You don't know what you're going to find. What will I find? The truth Caligula, come, your knowledge will be complete. Eternity will be yours, immortality. Immortality. No, don't go on. There are somethings that a man is not strong enough to know. A man, no. But a God. Yes. Turn back, turn back Caesar. No, get away. Get away! It's a dream, it's only a dream. Wait Caligula, I'm Livia. Don't you remember me? No, no. She's yours Caligula. No. No. Take me Caligula, you want virgins, don't you? Then you'll kill me. It wasn't my fault. Get away! Caligula. Go away, go away! No, no! It's a dream, it's a dream! It's a nightmare, it's not real! Miriam? No, you're just a dream. Miriam. But I'm still alive. I'm still alive. I'm still alive. No Caesar! It's a dream. No Gaius. A dream. Miriam... Miriam, Miriam, Miriam, Miriam! No! No! No! Look Gaius. Well this is the first time they've paid me the honor of coming to watch me ride. Yes Caesar, even your uncle Claudius. Let's not disappoint them Messala. I'll race you to history and back again. Let the will of the gods be done. Gaius, how are you feeling? Scraped bare, restored, shining. It's a beautiful day, a day for entering new worlds. I want you to send out the following orders immediately. I want all the statues that were put up in honor of my divinity torn down, and tell Demetrius that the project for New Rome has been canceled. And tell the gods that I have woken from my dream. Tell Petreius that little boots... I'm still alive. Miriam, I'm still alive.
