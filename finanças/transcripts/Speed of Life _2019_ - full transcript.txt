They're so competitive, I was just really excited - about the fact-- - Are you talking about... Are you... are you talking about Leonardo DiCaprio - is always trying to win? - Yeah, I'm just excited that he won, because he actually, - was... - Well, he fought a bear. - That's for you. - Thanks. Oh, man, it's from my parents. Uh... [Edward] I do not wanna open this right now, but... [Edward sighs] [cell phone chimes] [distant clattering] [gasps] Oh, Edward. David Bowie died. [Edward] How? [June] I don't know. Oh, my god, I didn't think he was ever gonna die. You know, he's not immortal, June. I know, I'm not... [sighs] I'm just saying, it's like, he was so, you know. Like he was an alien or something, and like... We don't know a lot about aliens. Maybe they don't die, you know. [Sighs deeply] [smooches] What'd he die of? - Hm? - Cancer. Ugh. [June sighs deeply] Mm. Damn, it's hard to make a joke about cancer. Why would you want to? 'Cause I like making jokes. [Groans] [Edward] Really? What? Hey, I got one. Ready? What does... what does David Bowie do after going to the gym? God. I mean, it's like a light has gone out, and you don't even see it. [June] I don't understand how I can see it so clearly. And it's like you can't see it at all. - [Blows air] - Stop! You're not taking things seriously. I'm serious. [Edward] Hey, June, we didn't know David Bowie. All right? Hate to break it to you. We didn't know him. I made a list. [Edward] A list? Of what? Of things that we need to work on. [Edward] Wait, is this... This is about your birthday? [June] Yeah. Of course, that's what this is about. Time is running out. What if I don't become the person that I'm supposed to be before it does? We got plenty of time. No, we have less time that you think we do. Okay. Uh, one, I think that other couples are a lot happier than us. Oh, shit. We're really doing this. Okay, uh... All right, well, I, I think that, um, you're a lot happier than you think you are. - [Scoffs] - You're just always seeing - the negatives. - Two, uh, nothing has changed. I bring up, um, my feelings and like, things that bother me, and when I tell them to you, then we just have the same fight every time, all the time. Yeah, that's correct. That's right. Because I'm me, and you're you. You make jokes about everything. And I, I need to take things seriously sometimes. Well, that's really boring. Honey, I like some of the jokes, I just... I need to be serious sometimes, too. You look so cute right now. No, sto-- Oh, no. Uh, four... Four. [June] Uh, what about the future? Um, I wanna think about, uh, family and children. - [Edward] Okay, all right. - And all that normal... All right, I get it. All right, stop, stop, stop. Like, I'm... Whoa. All right, well, you know what, that terrifies me, okay? And you know that, but like, I'm in. Like I'm ride or die with you, - you know what I mean? - Great you're in. - That's great. - But, like, you're just gonna have to, like, drag me through that part. I don't wanna drag you through anything, okay? I want a partner. What does all of this have to do with David Bowie? I just feel like, you just don't understand. That's who I am, June. You don't understand why he was so important. Do you want me to be somebody else? No. You just... You don't... You don't compromise. What? I do compromise. And what about taking care of us? - I do it all the time. - [June] You know, I, I... I provide things. You didn't buy this house, June. [Edward] You got it because somebody else died. You know, you should take stock in things too. I do. I take stock all the time. When I'm hurt, when I'm hurting, when you hurt my feelings, you never ever do a grand gesture. Like a... what? A grand gesture? Yeah. Yeah, it's like, when I'm hurt, then you would apologize and then you would do something nice for me. I do nice things for you. I know that. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that times like now, when I'm upset, now would be a time when you would do - a nice thing for me. - Like what? I can't tell you what to do, because then you're gonna do that exact thing and then I'm just gonna be disappointed - that I have to hand feed you - [chuckling] every little thing. How am I supposed to know otherwise? You're just supposed to know. Honey, that's how we know if we're compatible or not. [Edward] Hey. We're compatible. - Don't do that. - We're compatible. [June] I'm not talking about compatible - like that. - [Edward] Mm. [Chuckling] - We're compatible. - Stop it! [Laughs] - [Edward] We're compatible! - Okay! [June] How do you even know anyway? How do you even know that we're compatible? [Clattering] I just do. Okay, well, I don't, okay? I don't know that. And that is why I need the grand gesture. [Clatters, thuds] [Edward] Uh, can you just give me an example? I won't do that one, I'll just do something like it, I promise. No. See, that's exactly what I'm saying. I just... I need you to be able to, like, read my mind sometimes. I just... I, I can't do that, June. Well, that's what I need. Sorry. That's what I need, and you can't give it to me. [Sobbing] And now, David Bowie is dead. [Edward] Please, please don't. Don't, don't, don't. Please, I'm sorry, love bug. Come here. - [Whirs] - [Edward groans] [gasps] Edward? What? What? Edward! [Foreboding music] [inhales sharply] [automated female voice] Good morning, June. Time to do your stretches. Very good. Records indicate you will turn 60 in four days. You will need to double your calcium intake. - [Chimes] - One new message. [Automated female voice] Dear, Ms. June Hoffman, this is to inform you that your required retirement paperwork is now 30 days past due. Failure to comply with enrollment for relocation after the age of 60 is illegal. According to our records we had, - you're-- - [sensor powers off] [automated voice] U.S. law prohibits tampering with or disabling monitors. [Automated female voice] A high vaginal pH-level puts you at risk for infections. For more information, - say, "Tell me more." - [June sighs] [sensor crackles] [automated voice] U.S. law prohibits tampering with - or disabling monitors. - [Clatters] [light music] Are you gonna take a bath or what? [Crackles] [automated voice] U.S. law prohibits tampering with or disabling monitors. This may be reflected on your permanent record. [Light music] [rustling] [rasps, clanks] Looks like you got something over there. More than you got. When are you gonna come down to see my place? I have flowers. Are you gonna pay for knee surgery? I got what you need. [Laughs] [woman on TV] You have rights. Early collection before the age of 60 is illegal. Call the Jones Law Firm, today. Welcome back to "25 places to go before you turn 25". I'm your host, Jean Duncan. We are at number 17. Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Why are we watching this? [Jean] ...five hurricanes in the past three weeks, and it's still poppin'. [Jean] With the shoreline... [June laughs] I took all the monitors down. Wait. You still have service with those things down. I always thought it was all connected. Oh, no. Two companies. Read all the manuals. Oh, oh. We promise you won't find any old millennials bothering you at the clubs anymore. State of the art... Oh, shut your mouth. [Both laugh] - Who raised you? - [Laughing] Eat my fucking shorts. - Fool. - [Sam] Screw yourself. [Jean Duncan] ...without pesky distractions, this place is perfect for introspection and meditation on eternal youth. What about Fiji? Or Iceland? We could take the hyper loop to Mexico. We could have tacos. Mm. What if we left earlier? [Sam] Get ourselves a few extra days before you hit the big six-oh. [Sighs] I haven't packed. - [Chair creaks] - [groans] I never get used to that. [Device chimes] [beeping] Can you look at 29 across? Tell me what you think. From my experience, the answer is always ... [scoffs] Well, not this time. [Sighs] I can't remember anything anymore. You don't have to remember anything, you got me. [June] Yeah, but it just... Things just slip away, you know? - [Device chimes] - Memories. There's not enough room. Push things out like episodes of sitcoms. You know what, they say you're supposed to live in the present, but how do ya... How do you hold on to the present? I can't hold on to anything. I can't climb into it, Sam. It just slips right through my fingers. [Sam] Breathe, honey. [Sam sighs] We gotta get away, we have to. I'm not as good as you. Let me take care of you. ¶ I was working for dollars ¶ ¶ But they're giving me dimes ¶ [automated voice] Calories ingested for today, 824. Watch your sodium levels. Make sure you do your stretches. ¶ I went looking for knives ¶ ¶ And they're giving me blooms ¶ Show me the top of my head. [Automated voice] Call from Dad. - Call from-- - [Laura] Answer. - Good morning. - [Sam] Can you go and visit June today? She seems really down. Maybe bring her something for her garden? I'm doing fine, Dad. How are you? [Laura] Dad? Dad? Yeah, I'll do those things. [Sam] I love you. - Me too, love you too. - [Phone chimes] - [automated voice] Call ended. - [Sniffles] [Laura sighs] ¶ And I was looking for you ¶ Thank you for the flowers, honey. [Laura] No problem. Who's gonna appreciate them once they're planted though? [Clatters] [June] Oh. You never know. [Laura chuckles] It's all so romantic. You, Dad, finally getting out of here. Oh, yeah. Very romantic. [Laura chuckling] You know, I might be joining you soon. I thought I saw a wrinkle the other day. Also, I'm getting jowly, have you seen my jowls? Ooh, they better lock you up for sure. [Groans] [June sighs] [June] No. You have at least 30 more years - of civic productivity. - [Laura snickers] [June] Here, take your pick. [Laura] Oh. [June] Here you go. What kinda jobs are you looking for? Anything the employment office assigns me. [Laura] I think I can do a lot of things. I applied to be one of those dog walkers. [June] Oh. They still don't trust machines to do that. Lots of fresh air. Yeah, I just, I don't know what the right fit is. I feel like once I find the right job, everything will come together. I don't know if I ever figured out what was right. You may not. Are you serious? I didn't even know that was possible. [June] Oh, it's possible. Better to find what works for you in that moment. And then, commit. I just don't want to contribute to anything that could be harmful. There are too many cons to every job. [Laura] Sometimes I'm so jealous you guys get to just leave. Honey, I can't go. Because... Because Edward might come back. Usually, when they leave, they don't come back. [June] No, but, it's... You see, it's the way he, he left. You understand me? The way he left. He could come back. Anytime. [June] I remember... he told me I was quicker than anyone else, once. That's a good one. [Both chuckle] I remember jokes. I remember... his moles. I remember getting butterflies. You ever get butterflies? Uh, no. [Drone whirring] [water running] [calm music] [sighs] [calm music] [sighs] [clicks] [calm music] [sobs] [clicks] [groaning] [continues groaning] Ah. Lights off. [June] The way, way-- It's the way-- Yeah, but the way he left... The way he's disappeared. ...I need, and you can't give it to me. [June] And you can't give it to me-- That's what I need, and you can't give it to me. Can't give it to me... - [whirs] - [Edward groans] - [thuds] - [groans, pants] [gasps] [sighs] [pants] - [clatters] - [Edward] Ah! [Distant grunt] Lights on. [Distant thud] Dial Samuel. [Device ringing] [automated voice] Call from June. - [Sam groaning] - [device ringing] Answer. - [June] Samuel, are you there? - [Panting] [Sam] Yeah, yes. How fast can you get here? [Sam sighs] Not fast. Try. [Sam] What... what's going on? I'm hearing loud noises. I'm worried maybe it's a break-in. Okay, got it. Stay where you are. - I'll be there. - Okay. - Hang up. - [Device chimes] [distant grunt] [groaning] [clatters] [Edward sighs deeply] [Sam] Lights on. - [Edward groaning] - [clears throat] [Sam] Excuse me. Hello? Who are you? June? June! [June] I'm here. [Sam] Yeah, I think you better see this. [June] Is it safe? Honestly, I'm, I'm not sure, but... I, I think you better see this. [Sam] Excuse me. Hello? You there? He's alive. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, whoa, whoa. [Sam] Where's the room with the least amount of valuables? Put him in the bedroom. [Sam grunting] [floor creaking] [gloomy music] [Sam sighs] - [Sam] Lock door. - [Door closes] [light music] - [crackles] - [shrieks] [light music] This is where he came from. Edward. [Laughs] That was Edward? [Humming] So... Let's say, he's your Edward, he then travelled through time for you? This is unbelievable. How is he still young? [June] What if it's a wormhole? Then it's a rift in time and space. So for him, it's one second, and for me, it's 24 years. Okay, so... [Sam blows air] What are our next steps? I don't know. We ask him some questions? Questions. So... - We get to... - [cork pops] know this fella. We figure out why he's here and then he disappears. I don't know if he disappears. Or if we want him to. [Sighs] I mean, I woke up. And he was here. I've been thinking about him for decades. Why now? Can you make other things appear? [Clicks tongue] Now you sound crazy. Oh, yeah. I want an ice cream sundae, so I'm just gonna go boom. I don't think you're a wizard, June. - However, you did say... - [shushes] ...you thought of him. And he appeared. I'm always thinking of him. Maybe I am a wizard. I mean, he must know something. Like, where he came from. [June] Unlock door. [Door lock clicks] [door opens] Wake up. - Wake up! - [Edward gasps] Where were you? [June] Where were you? Where am I? Where's June? Where's all my stuff? I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm... - I'm, I'm sorry, I just, I... - Edward. Do you know, do you know, do you know me? Huh? [Edward] I don't understand, I don't know I got here. I was just... I think I'm having some sort of a high-grade panic episode. And I, um... [inhales deeply] [Edward] I don't know where I came from. It's just... It... Sir, I don't know how I ended up here. I was just in my house with my girlfriend, and... And, um... [pants] [Edward] Maybe I should just, um... I, I, I should call the police. You know, they might be able to help - if you just let me-- - You need to stay here. Until you have some answers for me. - [June] Lock doors. - [Lock clicks] [sighs heavily] He didn't recognize me. [Somber music] [June] Play Edward Scrapbook. [Automated voice] Playing Edward Scrapbook. [Chimes] [gasps] Damn it. [Breathing heavily] [gasps, pants] [footsteps rustling] Maybe wherever he was, changed him? [Sighs] [calm music] June. [June] Yeah? [Edward] I don't know what's going on. - [June] Unlock door. - Wait. [Lock clicks] Can I have that? [Calm music] [Edward] June? [Chuckles] It's good to see you. Yeah. ¶ I heard it calling out to me ¶ ¶ And I wondered ¶ [automated voice] Five upper lip hairs remaining. [Groans] ¶ Illusions of understanding ¶ ¶ Where we come from ¶ ¶ It tears at the soul ¶ Volume down. [Song volume decreases] [bird chirping] [chirping continues] [bird chirping] Oh, how did you get up here? Oh. [Blows air] Oh, you're stuck. [Water sloshing] Uh, hello? Hello? Uh, I'm upstairs. Fuck. Uh, I'm Laura, your neighbor, can you hear me? [Neighbor] Oh, shit, uh, hey. - I can hear you. - Hey, there's a bird stuck. Can you help us? [Neighbor] I see the bird. I'm not quite sure what to do here. What can you see up there? Yeah, um, I think the bird's wing is too big to fit through the opening. But I can't tell if it's injured or stunned. [Neighbor] Yeah. That's what I see too. It could have hit its head. Well, maybe if I, maybe if I push its wing. - Ah. - [Neighbor] Uh, it can... Okay, just don't hurt it. - [Neighbor grunting] - [Laura clicks tongue] [neighbor] Its tiny legs, I'm afraid I'll break them. Maybe you should be pushing, uh, down, instead of me pushing up? Um... Okay, will you catch her? [Neighbor] Oh, it's a her now? Okay. Uh, uh, uh, wait, hold on. [Laura] We'll get you out of this though, okay? [Bird chirping] - [clicking tongue] - [bird chirping] [gasps] - Got it. - [Sighs] This never happened at my old place. We had bugs, but not birds. Yeah, the hole is news to me too. Did you leave your window open? No screens. How long you been here? A few weeks. It didn't really seem like a place that you go and ask someone for sugar. [Chuckles] Moving down in the world? [Bird chirping] I was never really into birds. My dad's kinda girlfriend is obsessed with her birdbath. Well, not the birdbath itself, but the birds in the birdbath. She would have really loved this girl. Or guy, I guess. Oh, don't tell. Don't tell what, that you have a friend? Ah, well. No. Don't tell that she's in hiding. Now that I've said that part, don't tell that part to anybody. - Oh, okay. - [Laura] I mean, she's not really in hiding. I mean, she's technically totally fine to be there. It's just it's gonna be her 60th birthday in a few days, so... Oh, my god. Why do I even open my mouth? We've been through war together, today. You, you can trust me. Well, I guess you don't know her first name or anything. [Chuckles] [neighbor] Do you hang out with her a lot? Yeah, every few days. Most of my friends have moved out of town to start their families, so... I don't think I know anyone over 45. Really? You know, Charles Darwin didn't write Origin of the Species 'til his early 50s. Well, we can't all be Darwin. No. [Laughs] So, she's hiding out, but she's not really hiding out because she's not yet 60. [Neighbor] So, how do you see her? I just go and I check on her. She lives in the hills. She doesn't believe in the program. Neither do I. I mean, they don't get to go outdoors. They don't get to socialize with other ages. And all the medications they take, I mean, a simple hike could save a lot of money. Did you know that in the 1990s, they let them just walk around all the time? [Laura] Like, even people in their 80's. Just walking around. I mean, what do you get with the program anyway? Just cell block housing and regulated meals? Have you seen inside? No, but, um... my friend Christina had to drop her great aunt there, and she told me how dark it was. And how catatonic everyone looked. [Neighbor] Bird's probably not supposed to be here either. We're criminals already. Harboring a known fugitive bird. Bird's a secret. [Both chuckle] Joint custody? Okay. Hey, man, I gotta talk to June. Not right now. We just need to get some supplies. Hey, what's with you? I'm not dangerous, you don't got to supervise me. [Scoffs] We don't know that. I know that. I don't know you. June, she knows me. June knew you. [Sighs] [stammering] Let's... just give her some space, okay? We'll be back. [Sighs] [zipper rasping] [Sam] Uh, can you grab me that jacket? [Automated voice] The temperature is 76 degrees Fahrenheit. - You do not need a jacket. - Thank you very much. The one on the hook. Thanks. [Sighs deeply] Um... So, she always have something to say? Can't shut her up. [Sam] Though she did share a great meatball recipe with me. I'm just saying, she's not 100 percent evil. Where are you guys going? [Automated voice] Would you like me to book transportation? - Hotel? - Nowhere. [Woman on PA] Dinner reservations? Wait. Can they see us too? [Automated voice] Due to Ordinance TVC15, communication is allowed to be surveilled through sound recordings, not visual recordings. [Sighs] How long you two been together? [Sam] Together? [Scoffs] We're not together, together. Just friends. [Sam] She's been waiting for you all this time. You know that, right? [Edward] Where did she think I went? Everyone has their theories. Your parents thought you were gallivanting off. My parents. Wait, where are my parents? [Sam] I don't know. But they're over 60, right? So... I may have some idea. What happens after 60? [Automated voice] The Newton Company passed Ordinance 1934DB in 2029, announcing the plan to take care of individuals reaching the age of 60 by housing them in governmental care facilities. June's birthday. Wait. Is that why I'm here? It... Where'd you go, when you left? It only felt like a few seconds. You ever had that feeling when you're intensely concentrating on something, and all of a sudden you just snap out of it, and you realize how much time's gone by? No. - [Zipper rasps] - [Sam] Time... moves pretty slowly around here. [Sam] You wanna try to call her? You put this in your ear. [Sighs deeply] Other way. I got it. All right, so, how do I dial? [Sam] You remember her full name? - Yeah. - Then you just say it out loud. And if it's a common one, there's often a few follow up questions. Okay. A lot of things have gotten worse, but this is... [scoffs] but this is pretty intuitive. Sylvia Karp. [Edward] Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. They have her? [Edward] It's dialing. [Edward blows air] [somber music] [sighs] Hang up. No answer? They're gone. I, I have a few of those. Why don't you keep it? [Sam] You could try someone else later. [Automated voice] One new message from Samuel. [Samuel] Hey, June. Uh, I hope this is working. I wanted to tell you that um, I just wanna look around. Uh, everything is really different. And, um... And I wanted to give you the space that you need. I'll be back in an hour or so, I promise. I just wanted to hear your voice. You're the only person I know here. [Device chimes] [sighs deeply] [calm music] [Sam] Edward can't come with us, he'll draw too much attention. He has to stay here. Our plan... was to leave tomorrow to give ourselves time to get across the border. [Sighs] It'll be so much harder to leave after your birthday, is it? I need another night. Okay. [Sighs deeply] [light music] How did, um, how did you fall through the... wormhole? It was a fight. [Edward] A fight? Was it a fight? [Chuckling] Yes, it was a fight. Yeah, you know, I, I think I would, I'd call it more like a disagreement. I was telling him, very methodically, may I just remind you, of all the things that were wrong in our relationship. Ahh. Yeah. Tell me more. I don't know. I felt like we were travelling at different speeds sometimes. And I think... you needed to make a joke out of everything. I mean, it was a great joke. [Chuckles] Yeah, but, your timing, it's just horrific. Bad timing. Okay, All right. Ready? - What does David Bowie do-- - Okay, see? See what I'm saying? Here we go. [Edward] Okay, so the joke I was trying to tell that day-- [June] No. What does David Bowie do after the gym? [June] Oh, my god. See what I'm saying? This... is the joke he travelled through time and space to tell? This is it. Yeah, well, I didn't know the circumstances when I originally told it. This is so weird. It's getting better. [Chuckles] [laughs] He's Laura's age, you know? Oh, well, not technically. [Sam] Should we tell her? - I'm sorry. Who, who's Laura? - My daughter. I don't think she would believe us. [Sighs deeply] Well, as long as the timing still works out, Laura doesn't need to know. [Both chuckle] She's different, you know, from whatever June you knew. You don't know, it hasn't happened to you yet. Don't be a dick, Samuel. [Sam] It's not, not physical. Well, it's priorities, memories... personality. [Sighs sharply] Don't you guys miss food? - Yes. - [Giggles] Yes. [Man on TV speaking indistinctly] [man on TV] Absolutely no choice, no matter. I had to bring him home. [Woman on TV] You brought Buddy and Sally for dinner, and I'm serving leftovers! [Man on TV] No, honey. You're... Now you're... Leftovers? How could we have leftovers? We ate out last night. [Woman on TV] We had breakfast in. [Groans] Oh, hi. Hi. [Edward groaning] I can't believe you kept all my stuff, for so long. Hm. Did Samuel help you call your family? Yeah. But, um... It's kinda hard to track them all down. I wasn't really sure what I would say to them anymore. Oh. So many of our friends are gone. Other countries, or... Away. [Sighs] You picked a great time to come back. So what's your plan? You're just gonna make a run for it? [June sighs] What would happen if they found you? You feel the same. [Both chuckle] It's me. You gotta get out of here. I know. You look so sad. [Edward] Music on. [Chuckles] You can't do it. [Edward] Yes, I can. Music on. - [Laughs] - [Edward snickers] - Mu... mu-- - Stop it. Music on. - [Both chuckle] - It doesn't know you. - [Edward] Come on, June. - No. June, come on. You gotta escape this one way or another. Music on. Volume, low.

Hi, is, uh, is Sadie there? Sadie? Is... Is this, is this Sadie? Uh... You, you sound really different, um... This is uh... I'm, uh... My name's Eli. I'm a friend of your brother's, Edward. No, I, um... Listen. No, no, no. Hey. I'm really sorry to bother you. I just, I, um, I've been trying to get in touch with Edward, and, uh... I was wondering if maybe you, you might know what happened to him. [Scoffs] Oh, wow. So he just disappeared? Yeah, I know. That sounds, just... Just sounds like Eddie. [Snickers] And, uh... how, how are you? How are you, uh, dealing with... with the loss of... You had twins? What are their names? Oh, I'm sorry. I think, uh... he would've, he would've loved to have met them. What are their names? You know, that makes sense, 'cause, uh, they'd be all grown up now. Mm-hm. No, yeah, yeah. No, I get it. That's a, that's a lot to be. You know, a mom and a wife, and... you have kids, and... What about your, your, um, your family? Your mom and dad? Do you still talk to them? Oh. Okay. Right, no. Yeah. Of course. You know, I understand that that is, um... It's a difficult thing to deal with, and, uh... Hey, uh, where are you guys, uh, based at? Are you still living in the same place? Up on... That's really far. You guys moved? Right. No, that's... that's really good. Do you need anything? Do, do you need anything? I just, I know that that's a weird thing to ask you, but if there's anything I can do to help, um, I would love to... No, I can call you back. I just, I could... I could call you, and then, you could... Listen. I'm really sorry about all of this. I just, I just want you to know that wherever he is... he's okay. You too. Okay, you too. [Sighs] [June] I like your hair down. No. [June] No? [Sighs] I don't know how this happened. [June] How what happened? [Sighs] It's just my hair, it's thinning. Let me see. [June] Oh, that's not bad. No one my age has this. [Groans] I don't know, I just feel manly, and like, gross. Nobody else sees that, but you. Yeah, but I know it's there. [Sniffles] And I know that most women have, like, 50 years before their hair falls out, or thins, or balds. Ugh. I just hate that word, "balds." See this? [Laura] Uh-huh. I wear either a Band-Aid or a sweater, or both. Every day. - Why? - Birthmark. - A birthmark? - Yes. Okay, I have literal death on my head. So... - [June] Don't be ridiculous. - [Scoffs] A ponytail is a perfectly normal thing to wear on your head. Consider 40 summers of long-sleeved shirts. - Seriously. - [Chuckles] And dozens of excuses at the ready as to why I am wearing a bandage on my arm at the beach. [Sniffles] Yeah, okay. [June] Yeah? You know how much I love Bowie, right? Mm-hm. Okay, he was all about flaws. The guy had a weird eye. He had, I mean, messed up teeth. - [Chuckles] - Yeah? Totally badass. I mean, yeah, he was. Then again, he didn't have a birthmark, did he? He also wasn't balding. - And he got his teeth fixed. - Yes. - Didn't he? - Yeah. - So what am I talking about? - I don't know. Forget him. [Chuckles] Give me help with the... yeah. Oh, my god. Hm. [Approaching footsteps] [June] Sam! Over here. Hey. You're looking good. Right on pace. [Scoffs] Sure. Come over here. I don't want you to miss this. [Sighs deeply] That bird is the only one that comes out at night. [Sighs] I think it's hiding. I don't wanna leave without you. Close article. [Sighs] ¶ Wait, honey honey ¶ When I'm sad, um, be sad, I'm not happy, um... [man 2 on TV] I wanna be happy. ¶ I will never get to sleep ¶ [Edward sighs] ¶ Rebel, rebel, no ¶ ¶ I can never get to sleep ¶ ¶ I'm a rebel, rebel, no ¶ ¶ Hold me till I get to sleep ¶ ["Powa" by tUnE-yArDs playing] ¶ Oh baby bring me home to bed ¶ ¶ Rebel, rebel, no ¶ ¶ Lightning dances in my head ¶ ¶ Devil, devil, whoa, oh, oh ¶ Oh, mm, not... not there. Yeah. ¶ Not a pebble, pebble ¶ ¶ So, baby Bring me home to bed ¶ ¶ I need you to press me down ¶ ¶ Before my body flies away From me ¶ Um... Do you have a... Oh, yeah. Um... Uh... I got one. Okay. [Neighbor] These things just kick right in, right? - I mean, I don't... - [Laura] I think so. Okay, yeah. [Edward] So you guys are going to Mexico? But... I just got here. [Edward grunts] [sighs] [June] Do you think... 'cause you came here, could we go back there? [Warbling] What happens if... if it closes and I don't come back? From everything I've seen in this place... it would be better if you don't. - Right? - Yeah. Let's go. Okay. [Edward grunting] - [Edward] We're compatible! - Okay! How do you even know anyway? [Both groan] [clanks] I just do. [Young June] Okay. Well, I don't. Okay? I don't know that. And that is why I need the grand gesture. [Edward] Uh... Can you just give me an example? I won't do that one. I'll just do something like it. I promise. [Young June] No, see that's exactly what I'm saying. I just... I need you to be able to like, read my mind sometimes. [Edward] I just, I can't, I can't do that, June. [Young June] Well, like, that's what I need. And you can't give it to me. And now, David Bowie is dead. [Sobs] [Edward] Oh, please, please, don't, don't, don't. [Edward groans] [young June] Edward? What? What? Edward! [Gloomy music] [young June] Edward! June? [Sighs] Oh, my god. Here she is. Edward. Edward! Oh, my god! Holy crap! What was that? Did you see that? [Edward] Yeah. Hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. I'm back, I'm here, and... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [June] Oh. Oh, hello, new person in my living room. Hi there. - I'm... Who are you? - [Edward] Uh, she's... Uh, she's an old friend. What? I mean, what... I mean, what... What was that? Was I hallucinating? Um, no. It's a really long story. Uh, I promise I'll tell you later. Tell me about it later? Tell me now, you dick. [Chuckles] [Edward] Uh, what happened is, uh... I met... Uh, we... - We-- - I'm sorry I'm intruding. [June] You have a very lovely home. Is that a jewelry kit? [June] You know we really need to... I mean, can we do this another time with your friend? - I don't... - [Edward] Mm-hmm. Yeah. [June] Gosh, this is lovely. So, you make jewelry then? Uh, yeah, um... Yeah I started just a couple of weeks ago, actually just, um... collecting different charms and things. I thought maybe I'd, I don't know, make a bracelet or something. Sure. [Chuckles] Where do you find these, these charms? Um, different places. You know, um, estate sales are good, uh... - Garage sales. - Mm. Where did you find this one? This one, um... Uh, this one, um, - this funny old man... - Ah. - ...just down the street. - Sure. - [Young June] Yeah. - Oh. Oh. [Sighs] You know, uh... I saw it happen. I just happened to be on my way over. You... you saw him disappear? - [June] I did. - [Gasps] [chuckles] I mean, what, like, what was that, right? - Like what? - [June] Well... I think when David Bowie died, the universe broke. That's exactly right. Yeah. [Young June] It makes perfect sense. And I wasn't hallucinating. I don't think so. The world did feel really different when he died. I told you. - I told him. - [Chuckles] I bet. Well... I should, I should go. [Somber music] [both chuckle] [sighs] Goodbye, Edward. Gosh, you're so pretty. Take care. [Foreboding music] [warbling] We're moving. I mean, I can't, I can't... - [laughing] - [June] Oh, my god. Hey. [Groans] [sighs] [Sam] Come on, little fella. Could be a girl bird. Little fella-ette. Do you remember being a teenager? Not really. I remember the cars. I do. I remember the first time I sat next to a boy. Like this. [June] We sat next to each other at a movie. It was the first date I ever went on. He was looking at the screen, with almost his entire fist in his mouth, picking his teeth. [Chuckles] I remember popcorn. And I couldn't imagine... that he thought about me. [June] That he wanted me. That... He had any intentions at all about me. How did it all work out? We're not together, Edward and me. Oh. Why not? He ruined my life. [Chuckles] Not his fault, really. David Bowie's fault. [Chuckles] I believe you. [Sighs] Well, I guess I... better pack. - Hmm? - [Chuckles] Yeah, we'll pack soon. Yeah. Kinda liking it here, right now.
