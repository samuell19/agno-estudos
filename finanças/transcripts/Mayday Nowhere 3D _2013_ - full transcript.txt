criss-cross of shallow and deep cuts in your palms You are not truly happy Your smile is just the camouflage you wear You've decided not to hate And decided not to love Shutting your soul in a shell

I won't swerve, I won't veer I won't swerve, I won't veer Goodbye, strawberry-flavored donuts Raindrops falling on the corner cafe Goodbye, old black-and—white photographs A cinema of memories buried underground Goodbye, the park where we first met Who first kissed who that day Who forgot about the swings Goodbye, expensive cars, watches, and shoes In the end, all we can take with us Is a garden planted with memories In the end, all we can take with us Is a garden planted with memories If you had to say goodbye Say goodbye to everything tonight If you could only make one call Who would you call Good night, parrot and peacock Man and leopard together staring at the sea Good night, photo film and records Like poetry bobbing on the waves Good night, Statue of Liberty drifting onto Wall Street We brush against each other on the deck On the deck atop of the Dubai Tower Good night, dolphins jumping over Tibetan temples Who knew that the day we dreamed of for so long Would be even more beautiful than our wildest dreams Will we say goodbye Or abandon the world beneath the ocean What memories will you pack to remind you later What memories will you pack to remind you later The time has come to say goodbye No more tomorrows to chase What last scraps of regret are you keeping That you haven't resolved What last scraps of regret are you keeping That you haven't resolved Once the comets light up the sky And meteors fall like raindrops Once the radiation burns brighter than the sun Once love becomes thicker Once fate grows bolder Once forever fades away in the distance Once a full stop changes our perspective Makes humans finally human Be brave in saying goodbye Goodbye to the past and the future Goodbye, every lineage and status The clever and foolish This is our last goodbye Our last wish is to learn how to fly Up above alpine meadows that no longer exist Past stars and blue skies Noah's Ark sails for the horizon Noah's Ark sails for the dateline Noah's Ark sails up to the skyline Noah's Ark draws on to infinity It was a time when earth was still young We were born in the desolate sea Evolving until the Cambrian period Where we grew vertebrae and courage One day we began creating footprints Learned to embrace with our arms and learned to love We grew a human heart I want to walk A thousand centuries beside you I want to meet you each time I'm born Every reincarnation just for you I want to live A thousand centuries with you There is only one purpose to being born each time That is to be together with you With you With you With you Until the first day after civilization has been destroyed Once again a thousand centuries later Until the first day after civilization has been destroyed Once again a thousand centuries later Standing shoulder to shoulder in the Garden of Eden We smile and watch as the sun goes out Sitting at the edge of the bed, I turn around and see Someone fast asleep The aged face Seems to be me with eyes tightly closed Those who loved me and those I loved deeply All surrounding me All the regrets and attachments Form into one last teardrop Is there such a teardrop that will wash away regret Is there such a teardrop that will wash away regret Turn into a downpour on the street of no return Give me another chance to rewrite the story I still owe him a lifetime's apology Is there such a world where the sun never sets Is there such a world where the sun never sets Where the stars, sun, and everything listens to me The moon never wanes and the spring never strays Tree branches embrace their leaves tightly Who will hear that If there is still a tomorrow How would you dress up your face If there is no tomorrow How would you say goodbye There are times when we all can't see clearly Where we push ourselves to the side But I will always remind myself If there is still a tomorrow We all feel sorrow sometimes I never care for that feeling But I must make the best of each touching moment If there is still a tomorrow If there is still a tomorrow How would you dress up your face If there is no tomorrow How would you say goodbye If there is still a tomorrow How would you dress up your face If there is no tomorrow How would you say goodbye Is there a poem which has no period to be found Is there a poem which has no period to be found Youth will always reside in our years The boy and girl with just their guitar and dancing shoes Laughing away the pain in life Where only sweetness and beauty exist Will there be such a tomorrow to live life again From the start Will there be such a tomorrow to live life again From the start Let me feel the yesterday I splurged once more Survival or life, I'll won't waste either Leaving no regrets in this story Is there anyone who can hear? I won't bid farewell Sitting on the edge of the bed Gazing at my fingertips that are like smoke Grandpa Can you play the guitar? Regarding yesterday's fantasies We've all had them before In these fantasies, You can start over again and again Or perhaps today, You can start all over On this very day I'm leaving now Alright Here's a little gift for you Really? What is it? I'll play you a song Remove the mask of a long day Race towards the boundaries of fantasy A pumpkin coach at midnight Put on fairytale glass slippers Let me relish this feeling I am a lonely rose Let me relish this taste The chaotic world is impossible to understand Yesterday is too close while tomorrow is out of reach Listen to the darkness of night in silence The evening breeze kisses all the lotus leaves As I lie intoxicated by the pond By the time you see my beauty clearly Moonlight has dried my tears Who will love me Hold my hand tightly Hold me close, kiss me Oh love, don't leave You hear the alarm sound You shove the pillow aside You wake up in an endlessly tiresome life No hero appears No miracle occurs All you have is the bitterness of instant coffee You watch the news each day Waiting for something to happen Restart life, revive it again The earth's core doesn't boil Meteors don't fall Just you and your name gathering dust Anticipating a journey of great excitement Yet you are still waiting Until you've wasted your youth and run out of heat Before beginning to regret Looking forward to eternity, despite the scars Bravely pressing forward Maybe someone will be by your side As you sail towards a new life Every soul, every person Every disaster survived Every heartbeat, every tear Waiting for hope in the face of desperation If your birth was destined by fate If the end has yet to come Don't wait until the next life Make this moment worth living Anticipating a journey of great excitement You shouldn't wait any longer Until you've wasted your youth and run out of heat Before beginning to regret Looking forward to eternity, despite the scars Bravely pressing forward Dusk has not arrived for your life yet, the next stop is Your second round Your second round If I regret Would I be able to turn everything back If I regret Would I be able to turn everything back Memories are so beautiful While life lacks such dignity Memories are so beautiful While life lacks such dignity Why does this world Always feed people with pain Why does this world Always feed people with pain I can't understand Nor do I wish to understand I just want to fly Flee this crazy world With all the bitterness and strain With all the pointless tears I just want to fly Flee this crazy world If you're the one who finds me Don't try to bring me back I thought of you all night Till I couldn't recall your face I thought of you all night Till I couldn't recall your face You're a kind of feeling That's written in the summer night breeze You're a kind of feeling That's written in the summer night breeze Youth is like water flowing through your fingers It goes by quickly and you can't stop it Youth is like water flowing through your fingers It goes by quickly and you can't stop it Wasted all I could Then regretted all I could I just want to fly Flee this crazy world With all the bitterness and strain With all the pointless tears I just want to fly Flee this crazy world If

face When we were crying while laughing and hugging Your face Fills me with love, longing, song, and tears But I miss it so Fills me with love, longing, song, and tears But I miss it so Longing always

the future We agreed that no matter what Together we would walk to the world of the future Now the world of the future is here Why is it that your side and my side Don't belong to the same side Why is it that your side and my side Don't belong to the same side Our vow of friendship was as strong as Noah's ark But as I wait looking out into the sea My vision is forever blurred Maybe one of these days Time will really turn back Turn back for you and me Those easy days that we can't return to Turn back for you and me Those easy days that we can't return to Perhaps there'll be a day That really
