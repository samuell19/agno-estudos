What's wrong, is it too much? No, no. I'll be fine. You taught me well. I understand it is my time. Lucilia! Is she ready? Stand up straight. A lot of people are counting on you, Boudica. Do not dishonor the family name. Her hair, it's not right. She is ready. It needs to be done again. The future of our clan depends on this. I will not let you hold things up further. Forgive me, Scavo. Athedo is here. He's waiting in the throne room. Rome has appointed a new governor, Scapula. And he has decreed that the tribes must hand over all their weapons. As the only two tribes yet to bend their knee, we must stand together now and show the others that Rome will not take what is rightfully ours. Our arrangement can wait. We must act now. Will you join us? We will. We'll attend to our business upon our return. Father, I don't understand what is going on. You do not need to understand, Boudica. Now go with your mother. - But Father- - Do not disobey me, child! Go with your mother. Shh, it's okay, it's all right. Just don't scream, okay? You need to gather your things. Why? What are you doing? Mom! The Romans are coming for us. They are heading this way. We need to leave here at once. But what about Father? Your father has been gone for days. He's probably already dead. What? Here, put this on. Mama! Boudica, I know this is strange, but all will become clear, I promise. What is that? Supplies. You've been planning this, haven't you? How far are we going? Far enough. Where are you taking me? We haven't got time for this. No, this isn't fair. Do you trust me? Of course I do. Then follow me. I promise I'll explain everything. Whoa! Are you all right? Mom, please, can we stop? Ugh! There must be a better route than this! We're in the middle of nowhere! This is the safest way. The safest way for what? This is ridiculous. The Romans aren't coming for us, I lied. This is for your benefit, Boudica, for your future. I don't understand. I could not stand aside and let you marry a man that you don't love. I've done that, Boudica, and believe me, it leads to a lifetime of misery and regret. That young man that you saw from the other tribe, Prasutagus, your betrothed, the man that you would live with for the rest of your life, day in, day out, bear his children and do whatever he wants whenever he wants... Do you really want all of that? It doesn't matter what I want. It's what I have to do to honor our family. Oh, my child. You no longer have to do any of that. The union of our tribe and the Trinovantes is not your responsibility, it is your father's. This, this is why I have taken you away. So you can live whatever life you like. Something I could only dream of when I was your age. Will we see Father again? You were right before. I have been planning this for a long time. We are going somewhere where your father will never find us. Couldn't we just have reasoned with him? Do you want to go back? You think you know your father but you don't know him like I do. He is strong. And stubborn. And cruel. His pride will drive him mad and he will search for us until the day he dies or until he kills us. I have followed his rules and lived under his shadow for far too long. It is time for us to have some freedom, you and me. Is this really for both of us? Or just for yourself? You will always come first to me, Boudica. You are my one and only child, and I will do everything in my power to protect you. Now come on. We were lucky this time, my friend. If we'd faced greater numbers, the outcome might have been less fortunate. They will not make that mistake again. Scapula will be joining reinforcements as we speak. Our union must be confirmed. I can understand your impatience. Prasutagus and Boudica will be married soon enough. Our union will set an example to the other tribes that we can stand against Rome. Only with their help will we stand a chance. Athedo! Scavo, Scavo, we have received news from home. What is it? Boudica and Lucilia are both missing. We sent out search parties. There's no sign as yet. Was it an attack? Nothing else has been touched. Am I hearing this right? I suggest you resolve this as soon as possible. No daughter means no union. I will find them. Untouched, I hope. My son will not be wedded to tarnished goods. Tarnished goods? I can't help but note the timing of this incident, Athedo. How am I to know you are not involved? Watch your tongue, Scavo. Question my honor again, and the Romans will be the least of your troubles. You have many enemies, my friend, but I am not one of them. It's up to you to find out who is. And what of your responsibilities? I'll send my men out to search, and Prasutagus will accompany you himself. After all, it is his bride that is missing, too. You said it would take just a few days. I don't understand why we can't just stick to a path. I told you before, we can't afford to be seen. At this rate, we won't be seen by anyone ever again. We are not lost, I just haven't been there for a long time. We'll find it, I promise. Find what? Is that Father's? This has been worn by the leaders of the Iceni for generations. It is your birthright to become a leader one day, if you wish. Whilst I am with you now, there will come a day where I won't, let this broach be a proof of your lineage. I love you very much, Boudica. You must always know that. I love you too, Mom. Now come on, we must sleep. So this is where you used to live? Yes, and this is where we're going to live from now on. But there's nothing here. At least at home there are people. We are home. No, we're not. We can't live out here on our own. We belong back in the village. Your father won't have us back now. There's nothing there for you anymore. Well, what about Prasutagus? You don't love Prasutagus. Well, I've learned to. I thought like that once. Look at me. You're with me, now. We will make this work. Is he going to be all right? His wound is deep. It looks like he's tried to stitch it himself. Is he going to die? Boudica, we have no idea who this man is. We can't trust him, which means we can't help him. What are we supposed to do, just watch him die? He's just another mouth to feed, and we're going to struggle, just the two of us. Please, can we help him? Just take a look at the wound, see how bad it is and then make a decision? I will take a look at it, but be prepared. There's only so much I can do. I'm sure we'll find them. Of course, I was just- - I do not need words of sympathy from you, boy! Understand? I need progress. Is there any word from? Yes, apologies. We've been informed that he was killed by his own nephew. Do you wish to speak to him? No. No, if is dead, the Catuvellauni will be too busy fighting amongst themselves to have been involved. Gather the men, we're moving on. Where are we going? I've been a fool to think that anyone other than the Romans could be behind this. The Romans, are you sure? Open your eyes, boy. It can be no one else. But the Romans are trying to quell the fighting. This would be an act of war. Their mere presence is an act of war. You children, you have no idea what they've done to this land. How things were before they poisoned us against each other. How they make us abide by their laws and worship their false gods. Have you learnt nothing from your father? You know I speak the truth. The Romans are not to be trusted. Nothing is beneath them. Then where should we look first? Camulodunum. The Roman town? Hm. Very well. I can't believe the state of this place. Finding food and water will not be as easy as back home. What do you mean? It's a different world out here. You'll have to learn how to survive properly. Don't worry, I'll teach you. Did you live here when you met Father? I met your father on our wedding day. He never came here? I was 14 when my mother told me it was time to get married. I was petrified. I cried myself to sleep every night just worrying about who this man was gonna be. Your father never visited me, and we never met on our own. We married and he took me back to his home. The town seemed so big in my eyes, compared to here. I couldn't believe my life had changed in just one day. And Father? As the Romans started to take over our land, anger and bitterness took over your father. He became nasty and violent. The smallest of things would set him off. I would have killed myself years ago and ended this nightmare, had you not come along. Boudica, we cannot trust him. You know nothing about him. Exactly. You cannot trust men. And we certainly cannot trust him. Listen to me. I will kill him if he does anything to give me reason to do so. Listen to me. Is she ready? Do not disobey me, child. Do not dishonor the family name. A lifetime of misery and regret. Do you really want all of that? Mom! Boudica! Boudica! Boudica! What's wrong, what's wrong? He's awake. This town is now under Roman rule. I must leave our weapons here. We are not here to fight. We are here to find my wife and daughter. Drink! You, I'm looking for somebody to help me. Meaning? Where are the slaves kept? You need him, over there. He can help you. Do you have anything for sale? I have coin. There's no wasting about with you, is there? Follow me. Hey! This is my latest door. Criminals mostly, all destined for the mines. This one on the left's pretty smart Unless you're willing to offer a better price. Any of these tickle your fancy? I'm looking for women and girls. Oh, yeah? Well, we've got one woman at the moment if you can call her that. Which is a shame because they can be quite popular, if you know what I mean. The women in this land do little for me, to be honest. I prefer a woman who's taken a bath at least once in her lifetime. We will not find them if we kill today. It's time to leave. I'm sorry for taking so much. You caught me by surprise. I mean you no harm. I didn't realize anybody lived here. We haven't always lived here. But we do now. This is our house. Who are you? My name is Geminus. I traveled here with my tribesmen to help them fight the Romans. But we were outnumbered in defeat. I was separated from the others along with another wounded man. This wounded man, is that who you were burying out there? I'm so sorry. You have said you've not always lived here. What brings you to this place now? This is my family home. I grew up here as a child. My husband has died recently. It was too dangerous to stay there. I decided to bring my daughter here to start a new life away from the Romans. Let me make this clear. My father built this house, and I will not be driven out by a stranger. You can remain here until you regain your strength, but as soon as you are better you will have to leave. I appreciate your honesty. Winter is fast approaching. And this place is falling apart. - How do you expect- - Enough. We don't need your help. I'm quite aware of the circumstances that we are in, but myself and Boudica can work it out together. Boudica. It means goddess of victory. As long as we understand each other, we are settled. What if Geminus could help us? When he gets stronger he can help us rebuild this place. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. He needs to get strong first. Now get some rest. You're looking a lot better. I feel it. I can't thank you and your mother enough. Where is she? Out gathering food. With another mouth to feed, it's crucial we find more to eat. Has it ever occurred to you you may not be able to stay here forever? What happens if you run out of food? I don't know. All I do know is wherever my mother goes, I'll go. What about you? Don't you have a home to go back to? Family? Wife? I have dozens of wives. I'm sure they all miss me terribly. Are you married? Sorry, that... That really isn't any of my business. No, it isn't any of your business, but no, I'm not. Really? Would you like to be married some day? Is that some kind of proposal? No, I'm just intrigued to know what type of girl you are, that's all. What type of girls are there, then? Well, there's some that wish to get married and have children. Most others prefer to experience more. And which do you think I am? I don't know yet. Guess I'll have to spend more time with you to be sure. What type of man are you? Thought I knew You're looking a lot better today. And up on your feet, that's good. You can leave first thing tomorrow morning. I understand. Can I at least cook for us tonight? If you so wish. You don't mind giving me a hand with these, do you? I can see what's happening. What do you mean? You and him. You think I can't see it? See what? The looks between the pair of you. Going quiet when I walk in the door. Offering to feed him and tend to his wounds. I'm not stupid. I never said you were. Well, it just feels like you're both getting a bit too close for comfort. And what's so wrong about that? When you dragged me out of my home in the middle of nowhere, you told me it was so that I could live the way I like. And love who I want. So why do I still feel trapped? Don't be so ridiculous. Me, ridiculous? How is that fair? Look, I don't want to argue with you, not over him. Me, neither, but I just need to breathe. Maybe you need to think about the real reason why you dragged me out here. And what is that supposed to mean? Boudica! Boudica! Up! Get up! Grab your things and let's go. Where are we going? We're heading to the next Roman town. What makes you think they're there? Just because it's a Roman town? Let's not waste our time, Scavo. When Rome has deprived you of something you love, you tell me then that we're wasting your time. I will search every Roman town in the empire if that's what it takes. If you and those men are too lazy to do so, then leave now, 'cause I will not rest until I have my family back. When Boudica was born, she looked up at me, and I knew I would do anything to keep her safe. I would never rest, I would never give up til she could live in a land free of Rome's tyranny. I will fight them until my dying breath. What is she like, Boudica? She is tough. She's a hard worker and headstrong. She has a temper, too. She'd eat you alive. So nice to be back on my feet again. I'm lucky to be where I am, though. Like I said, I'm very grateful to you and your mother. I know she isn't fond of me. But you've always given me a chance. You have a kind heart. And if there's anything I can do for you, I'll do it. We'd better get moving if you want to find something good to cook tonight. Be dark soon. How have you never learned to do these things? These are all basic survival skills. Just something my father does. Being the leader of our tribe means jobs like hunting tend to be his responsibility. Leader of a tribe? A king? Yeah, I guess you could say that. He is a very powerful man. I thought your father was dead. Yeah, he is. I guess it hasn't quite sunk in yet that he is gone. You all right? Yeah, I... It's been a busy afternoon, and I guess my body isn't used to it yet. Do you mind if we sit? Not for long, just- - Of course. What is that? It's been passed down through my family. My mother gave it to me when we left home to come here. It must mean a lot to you. It does. Family means a lot to me. Something my father always taught me. Have I grown to mean a lot to you? We need to go now. My mother will be worried about me. About where I am. Geminus. A gesture of thanks for everything you've done. Good morning. How're you feeling? About yesterday, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. I just thought you felt- - Don't apologize. I was just confused about how to feel, that's all. So how do you feel now? Mom? What's wrong? You don't look very well. I'm fine. Don't fuss. Where are you going? To get some fresh air. Maybe you should go with her. I don't think it's wise to leave her alone. I'm worried about you. There's no need, I'm fine. You're not well. It came on during the night after I'd had food. The weather is changing. It is normal to feel ill this time of year. This has nothing to do with the weather. Come on, I need to take you back to the cottage so you can rest. Come on. What's happened? I don't know. I was outside, and it just caved in. We're lucky we weren't inside. There's not much we can do about this now, we're just gonna have to weather it. Why would a hole just appear? It doesn't make sense. You must have done something. This is going to take days to repair. Can you repair this? Of course we can. I'll collect wood for the supports and you can fix the roof. How long until it all falls down? What would you suggest? How about we just tear the place down and start again from scratch? We could look for somewhere else to stay. We? You are very welcome to find somewhere else. Calm down, both of you. If it gets worse, then we can make a decision. But right now, you need to rest. But Boudica, we can't- - No! Leave it to Geminus and me. Been working on this roof for days. Doesn't seem to be getting any better. The supports are all rotted. It'll all need to come down, and we can't do it between us. I just wanted to do something nice for my mother. One less thing for her to worry about. Of course, but it's just not safe anymore. Listen to me. You have to find somewhere else to stay. Boudica! There are bound to be villagers nearby. Or you could go back home where you know it is safe. Why do you want us out of here so badly? I don't, it's just- - Just stop! It's still standing, so my mother and I will continue to live here. Grow up and be realistic. I don't have to do anything you say. Boudica? Boudica. What's happened? Look, if this is about the roof- - It's not about the roof. What, then? This is about him, isn't it? Not now. Now is a perfect time. I don't trust him, Boudica. I haven't from day one. I still think that there's something not quite right about him. The way that you two are getting close together, I just feel like he's coming between us. What are you trying to say? I'm just saying that he needs to leave now. So you can have me all to yourself? Is that it? What? You didn't bring me out here so I could be free. You just want me to yourself all the time. No, that's not true. Yes it is! If I was to go off and marry, you would be alone with Father. And you've made your feelings towards him perfectly clear. How dare you? What, tell the truth? Let's start being honest with each other, shall we? Or let's carry on pretending that this whole nightmare was to protect me. Everything I have done has been for you. You are my daughter, my one and only child. I would rather die than see you miserable for the rest of your life. Just because you were miserable doesn't mean for a second that I would've been. I know you would have. No, you just assumed. Why can't I make my own decisions about what happens to me? Stop thinking that my desire to protect you is the same as trying to control your life. Maybe you should've stayed. Or maybe you should focus on saving your own marriage instead of ruining mine! What is wrong with you? We've fought in battles that have lasted weeks, and now you drag your feet? But we're not in battle. What did you say? What did you say? We're not in battle, Scavo. We're just aimlessly wandering around the forest with no idea where we're going. We are searching for my wife, my daughter. We understand the urgency, Scavo. Are we really gonna search every Roman town in Britain until you're satisfied they're not there? I will do whatever it takes. The trail has run dry, Scavo. Your future queen is out there. And unless you want to live the rest of your lives under the leadership of Rome, you will continue to help me find her. This is not just for me. This is for the future of the Iceni tribe, the future of your families. If you wish to turn your back on your tribe you're welcome to leave now. She's not here. I know, I saw her run off. Is everything okay? This has nothing to do with you. Actually, this has everything to do with you. I'm concerned about my daughter and how close you have become. I don't trust you. And I can't just sit here and watch my daughter have her heart broken. Lucilia, I can appreciate the fact that we've not agreed on certain things, but if there's one thing we can agree on, it's that we both care about Boudica very much. Nothing can break the love a mother has for her daughter. I don't want to do that. I just want to be given the chance to make her happy. I should go and find her. - If you hurt her- - Lucilia. You have my word. Bring her back safe. Let her know that I love her. I thought I'd find you out here crying. But instead, you're trying to kill a tree. Don't push me. I'm trying to help you. Widen your stance. Bend your knees. You want to hit here and on the way back you hit here. Your mother's worried about you. She's upset. I can see you are, too. Is there anything we can do? The way I spoke to you before, I'm sorry. There's no need to apologize. I understand. The way you were attacking that tree, the way you speak to people, you have fire and passion. If you were to channel all that energy and anger into one thing you would be unstoppable. Tell me about you, Geminus. There's not much to tell. I've never really known my place in this world. Just been thankful to survive each day. Sometimes I feel like I just go wherever the wind takes me. But with you, Boudica, I know where I am. Halt! What business do you have here? I'm surprised to see a Roman troop about these parts. Are you in search of something? Perhaps we can help. We do not need any help from the likes of you. So you haven't seen two women on your travels? We do not know what you are talking about. Now move along! Very well. They have weapons. Wait! We'll take those weapons before you go. By order of Governor Astoria Scapula. Which weapon? I'm afraid me and my friends have decided we don't want you bastards telling us what we can and can't do. What are you doing? Leave now, boy. You don't have to be here. I'm ready to fight. You're too important. Go back and tell your father what has happened. You've done enough son, now leave. What tribe do you belong to? Belong to? I am Scavo, King of the Iceni tribe. And I am looking for the Romans who took my wife and daughter. We do not know where you family are. Surrender now while you still have the chance. I would rather die fighting for what I believe than crawl away like a coward. What are you doing here? - Speak! - A rescue mission. For who? A general, brother to the governor himself. Scapula's brother? Yes, he's in the hills to the north. Please, let me- I'm searching for a Roman general. Have you passed anyone? No, we haven't. Who are you? What are you doing here? We are very sorry, we are on our way. We're not sorry. We have done nothing wrong. I believe it's none of your business, anyway. Boudica, let's just go. Do you know who I am, girl? Girl? I don't appreciate your tone. Take her back to where you came from immediately. If you want me to move, talk to me, not him. Let's just move on peacefully. Don't think you can get away free after disrespecting a soldier of Rome. Okay, this is getting out of hand. Boudica, we need to go. Now! Where have you been? You need to leave now. What? I'm ordering you both to leave immediately. It's not safe anymore. You have to come with us. I can't. Please, come with us. I said no. Now gather your things together. Geminus! Stop, what's happening? It's not safe here. It never has been. And now the Romans are coming. Enough! You do not have the right to order us around. Are you not listening to me? The Romans are on their way. This is my home. I will not be forced out of it. You need to calm down. It's going to be fine. When Geminus came looking for me, a Roman found us in the woods. He started fighting with Geminus, and we killed him. What?! He was going to kill us. We had no other choice. You could've listened to me but you chose not to! And now I've killed a Roman officer. The Romans are our enemy. So am I! I'm a legionnaire in the Roman army. That's not true. I was recruited two years ago and I've been fighting against people like you ever since. I don't believe it. You're just saying that to get us to leave. It's the truth. Boudica, I'm trying to protect you. When you first arrived here, the wounded man I was with, he was a Roman general. I volunteered to stay by his side while my compatriot went off for help. More legionnaires are on their way. And when they get here, I'm not gonna be able to protect you. I'm not going anywhere. If I die, it will be in this house. If you stay here you will be sealing Boudica's fate as well. I can't allow that. No, Geminus, don't! You're not a bad man. Please, my mother loves this place. We'll figure something out, but do not hurt her. Then talk sense into her. This isn't you. I know who you are. You're sweet and caring. You have a good heart. You don't know your place in this world, remember? I love you. I know you love me, too. Your place in this world is with me. Please, I beg you, when the legionnaires come, reason with them. You always said how thankful you were to me and my mother for saving your life. That'd be in return. Kill me. I deserve no less. I love you both. I need you both with me, by my side. Whatever challenges await us, we will face them together. We need to talk. Boudica, he's lying to us. Listen to me. Geminus said that he volunteered to protect the Roman general, yes? When we got here, he was wounded and barely able to stand up. What use would he have been to the general? Look, I'm not saying this to cause another argument. I'm just saying that I'm certain he's not telling the truth. I want to know what's really buried out there. If you're not right about this... There's no question about it. His story doesn't add up. Something else happened here. Think, Boudica. I'll take him into the woods, and that will give you enough time to dig up the grave. I'm not leaving you alone with that man. He's not going to hurt me. You don't know that. We don't know what he's capable of. Boudica, I told you I'd always protect you. I will go into the woods. You stay here, and while we are gone, you find out what's buried in the ground. Do you trust me? Yes. Walk with me. I understand we haven't always seen eye to eye, Geminus. But you must appreciate I love my daughter very much and I can sometimes seem a little overprotective of her. Your mother must have been the same way with you. I understand how young men are recruited into the legions. For some, it can be the right decision. Was it that way with you? It was either join the Roman army or be killed. I wasn't ready to die. And now that you've killed one of your own? Whether you meant to or not, I can imagine that you're going through a tough time right now. What you do next is very important, not just for you, but for Boudica, as well. So what are your true feelings for my daughter? If you do wish to marry her, I need to know your intentions for her safety. Why have you really brought me here, Lucilia? We both know you'd never let me marry Boudica. Are you trying to distract me from something? I'm looking for my wife and daughter. Have you seen them? We have no idea what you're talking about. Move on. Who is this man? I told you to move on. I do not take orders from Rome. Who is this man? He is General Octavius Scapula. Brother to Governor Ostorius Scapula. Now move on or face the wrath of the most powerful man in Britain. You'll both be dead long before long before he's here. Leave now while you still have the chance. Legionnaires are on their way. I wouldn't be so sure, boy. If your brother wants to take my family from me, I'm gonna take his. I'm sorry, Boudica. He arrived here a day before you did. He was looking for you. I tried to get him to listen. I tried to make him leave, but there was no reasoning with him. He was like a madman. Before I knew it, he pulled his sword out and he killed the general. He seemed so pleased with what he had done, I knew I was next. It was self defense. I had no other choice. I had no idea who you were then or what was going to happen. Please. Try to understand. Where is my mother? Look at me! No, no! Listen to me, listen to me. No! Boudica, why can't you see you're so much better than them? You don't need her or your father anymore. That passion, that fire inside of you, you have the strength to change the world. If you would ask me, I would turn my back on Rome and stand by your side, no matter what. Think about what we could do together. Let go of the past, Boudica. Embrace the warrior inside you. Ugh! Mama! Mama! Boudica. Mom? Boudica! Mom! Come on. I like your confidence. Put the sword down, Boudica. I want not to have to kill you. It's time for you to go, Geminus. You need to get away from here and never come back. I'm not going anywhere without her. I've turned my back on everything for you and now I wanna collect what's mine. I will never go with you! My place is with my mother. Just go, Geminus. Look at you. She could never love you. She would've loved me if it wasn't for you. If you would've just left us alone, everything would've been fine. Everything would've been fine? You're nothing but a cruel, - weak man. - Shut up! You need to grow up, girl. Do you really wanna live under her control the rest of your life? You really need somebody to set you free. Ugh! The fight in you, look how strong you've become. You're a goddess, a warrior. Boudica. No, no. You didn't need your father, now you don't need your mother. You're right, and I don't need you either.
