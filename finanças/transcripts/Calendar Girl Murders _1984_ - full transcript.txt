Hank. Oh, I'm sorry. I got a little bit of the dog that bit me. I'm not feeling myself today. I'll know this song by airtime. I've been doing this all my life. Can I go home, please? Let me go home. Let's wrap it up, Henry. Richard's on his way. Hank: Everybody take five. Remember your positions. We're expecting you, too, Nathan. [ Reporters shouting questions ] Can you look this way, please? Well, boys and girls, what do we have that's hopeless so far this afternoon? Everything is fine. It's just 100%. Did you manage to re-cut the beginning of the show? Yes, and it looks great. We're still doing the history of the magazine and all the social stuff, but now the centerfolds are filtered through there a little more sparingly. That sounds wonderful. Cleo, I want you to call the police, get some backup for armed security. Well, what for? Because we've had a lot of promo on this show, and we're on live and we're gonna have every nut in town in our laps. Call the police. [ Men laughing ] But they bigger than a female. Incredible. Look at that. They gotta use a hot airbrush on that. Airbrush--who cares? I mean, who really cares? 'Cause, uh, the human body's a thing of beauty. Right, Hernandez? Am I right? What if I don't sign it, huh? What about that? What if I just tell them it's a matter of manpower here? Hey, Tony, why do they want homicide for this paradisething? I thought Metro handled security. What's the matter with you guys? You don't even care? Look at this-- stoner's leaving, breaking up the team. What? I got a transfer. Yeah? Well, I'm not gonna sign it. Aw, Dan. You know what it is, don't you? You're depressed. You just turned 40. You feel you lost--i don't wanna hear that. You know what they call it, Dan? Midlife crisis-- that's what they call it. It's called getting tired of 2 A.M. phone calls and trips to the morgue.[ Phone rings ] Homicide. Brencato. Hernandez, how do you say "don't fix it again, Tony" in Spanish? Maybe he'll understand that. Yeah, they got a copy of it. They're looking at it here, drooling over it. Hey, Dan, take a look at this. Cassie bascomb, angel of the year. Sort of makes your hands sweat, doesn't she? I don't need that. You aredepressed. Yeah, ray, I'll see. Not too much they want, homicide. They want a plainclothes detective that can blend in with the surroundings. Hey, Tony, you're looking at your man. You know what they used to call me in high school? The chameleon. Yeah, well, there's just one other little requirement. Female.what? I'll fill you in a little later, Rose. That's discrimination, Tony, and you know it. Hey, Dan, will you just come back inside and hear me out? That's all I'm asking. We've been through this before. So indulge an old friend? Fifteen years. [ Sighs ] I don't know. [ Television playing ] Woman: Wait, wait, wait. Tony says, uh, bankers hours no more 2am phone calls... You tell that to Nancy.Yeah. Well, that's exactly what he said last time. I got to thinkin', well I don't know. Whether operation is gonna be enough for me. That's exactly what you said last time. How am I doing?You're fine. Watch the step. I know where the steps are, just look up above me. Okay, you're fine. You're fine. [ Dance music playing ] Hey, what happened to the game? What is this, cable? It's called tasteless adult programming. Come on, Todd. That's that, uh, paradise party. Hernandez is working that. Howard Rose? How Rose. Come on, Todd. I'm watching the game, I just switched it during the commercial. Let's go, young man. Don't strain your eyes, stoner. Yeah, I get it in the morning, hon. Ready, two... And take it. [ Dance music playing ] This party tonight is celebrating paradise magazine'sentry into your living room, so, uh...[ Laughs ] Cover up. I'm peeking. [ Laughs ] Mr. Trainor sent a limousine for me this evening. Thank goodness it missed. There's so many celebrities tonight. There's Debbie, Lana, frank, Barbara. They're all here. It's packed. Full of optimists and money and fun because of Mr. Richard trainor. He's so generous, he gave me a group insurance policy. I get a thousand bucks if I'm killed in a group. Could you die? But I am kind of lucky, though. I made a killing in the market today. I shot my butcher. Oh, forget the frivolity. Look who's here-- miss congeniality! Miss January! Pamela cummings! Ah, precious. Come in, darling. Look at this face, ladies and gentlemen. Not a blemish. There is a god. Pam, I'm a great fan of yours. I have a joke, like the dress you almost have on. That wasn't it. Let me ask you a question, Pamela. What do you call a boomerang that won't come back? Hello, anybody in? What do you call a boomerang that won't come back? Oh, a-a stick. A stick! 100%. She's brilliant. Look at the face. Didn't I see you and redford on rodeo last week? Pamela, can you hear me? Read my lips. Didn't I see you and redford on rodeo last week? Hello! Hello! Get her off of there. She's blowing the whole thing. Get her off. If looks could kill, you'd be a real angel by now. But in your case, a little devil, huh, Pam? Huh? You get it? Hello! Hello! [ Laughs ] We're really not like that. I mean, people have this crazy idea, you know, just because we pose in the nude, we're, well, you know. Well, it's been nice trying to talk to you, Pamela. Thank you very much. I just don't want everybody to think that we're all a bunch of hookers. Hookers. She said "hookers" on TV. I'll be okay. Guess who else is here. They're all here tonight. You've missed nothing. Miss February-- Kara Alexander. Come in, precious angel. Look at this. [ Laughs ] Oh, Gail keating, miss march, is here. Come in, precious. Look at these. Kiss, kiss, kiss. And speaking of miss march... ♪ March, march, march, march, march, march, march ♪ I have to go now. [ Laughs ] Come and join the fun. ♪ March, march, march, march, march, march, march ♪ Aah! [ Crash ] What the hell was that? Find out, Charlie. Take a look. Oh, my god. [ Phone rings ] [ Ring ] Yeah, stoner. No, Tony. No! [ Sighs ] Well, if it's suicide, what do you need me for? Oh, yeah? Well, did you talk to the room clerk? She's drunk, she's unhappy, she just made a fool of herself on TV. Tony, why rent a room? Why not jump off the roof? Anybody talk to the parents?They're flying out tomorrow. Listen, Dan. Dan. The desk clerk's story sounds a little fishy to me. Look, maybe you ought to talk to him. You're trying to reel me into this thing. I'm just trying to do a job here. All right, guys, here's the scoop. The girl didn't jump. She came straight down. From the edge of the balcony up there out to the line of impact is 88 inches. Most of your jumpers really take a leap. Maybe she was sitting on the rail and she went over backwards. From the way she landed, she went over head first and then rotated onto her back. I'll see you kids at the office. Yeah. Thanks. What do you think? What do I think? I think all this whining about my instincts and this being a tough case is somewhat smoke. [ Sighs ] Yes, sir. May I help you? Yes. Detective stoner. I understand you were on duty when Pam cummings made her reservation. I was, but it was by phone, so I really don't remember her. [ Laughs ] Well, she must have registered. Look, this place has been a madhouse. Why don't you ask lieutenant b-b--what's his name? Yeah, brencato.I told him everything about this. I know you did that, but I want you to tell me now. Excuse me. Detective stoner?Yes. I'm Heather English. I was a friend of Pam's. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, what can I do for you? I just want to talk to you for a minute. Thanks. Mm-hmm. I mean, I know what they're saying about Pam, but I just don't believe it. I mean, she never would have killed herself. How long have you known her? Long enough to know that she was basically a happy person. Yeah, well, she wasn't too happy tonight. Have you talked to lieutenant brencato? Yes, but he said that you were handling the case. [ Laughs ] Yes, go on. There's something else I think you should know. I mean, it might not be anything, but a couple of months ago I remember hearing that Mr. Trainor was upset 'cause some weirdo was following one of the girls around. Apparently this guy was even threatening her. Threatening who, exactly? Cassie bascomb. No, I've just seen pictures. Well, anyway, tonight when brencato asked US if there had been anything like that, you know, creeps or hate mail, trainor didn't mention it. And when he didn't, nobody else did either. You're suggesting he's trying to hide something? I don't know. But I thought that since you were handling the case, you ought to know. Yes, since i'm handling the case. Thank you. What do you mean maybe? Either you've taken the case or you haven't. [ Sighs ] I don't even know if there is a case. That's why I want to talk to trainer. Oh, right. I get it. This is all just for Tony. It wouldn't have anything to do with all beautiful women. Nance, come on. I'm a big boy now. Yeah, well that's what I'm worried about. [ Music playing ] [ Laughing ] Mr. Trainor? Detective sergeant Dan stoner. Uh, yes. Uh, sergeant. This is Cleo banks, our managing director. How can we, uh, help you? That's all for now, ladies. Who's that? I think he's a cop. Must be about Pam. Do they always leave notes? No, no, of course not. But in this case, her parents, her friends, everyone says it just wasn't in the cards. Oh, uh, sergeant, let me introduce Kara Alexander, Gail keating, Heather English. Alan Conti. Sergeant stoner is investigating Pam's suicide. And the possibility it was not a suicide. You mean she might have been murdered? Why? That's what we're trying to find out. I understand some guy threatened one of your girls-- a Cassie bascomb. Well, yes, but that was a very long time ago. Excuse me, but if you and the girls are going to make that luncheon, you'd better get going. Oh, yes, that's true. Girls, I'll be with you in a few minutes. Nice to meet you.It was nice to meet you. Good session. I'm sorry. That was not very subtle, but the last thing that I need is for you to frighten these girls. I'm gonna have to talk to them sooner or later. You already did. At least, your lieutenant did. All right, let's start with one of your girls-- this Cassie bascomb. Do you have her address? Cassie bascomb doesn't have anything to do with this at all. She's not even part of the organization any longer. I still would like to talk to her.Why? I want to cover all the bases. Do you have her address? You can get it from my secretary, yes. "Kara exudes a carefree spirit, "a playfulness, and yet just below the surface, there's that smoldering sexuality." [ Laughing ] Who writes this stuff anyway? I don't know. Some guy. [ Laughing ] Oh, this is great. "Raised in the sun-washed beaches of Malibu, she is proud of her firm, strong body." Hey, don't you have anything to eat in here? "'I was basically raised in a bikini,' "says the forthright miss February, 'so nudity has never had any negative connotations.'" hey, Kara, bring me another beer, will you? "Always full of life and vitality..." [ Gasps ] There's a dime store kitchen knife-- no prints, obviously. The killer was right-handed according to the medical examiner. Uh, the depth of the wounds? Soft tissue-- could be man or woman. What about the boyfriend? Well, he's all in pieces. He was in the living room when it happened. He heard a car leave from the road up above the house here. Tony: And no footprints. No, it's all concrete and tile out there. Yeah. Well, if you ask me, it sounds more like an attack on paradise magazine than on these girls. Well, if it is, it backfired. That Pam cummings issue sold out. Sex and death, you know. Big sellers. The arrogance of this guy-- January, February. So who's miss march? Gail keating. She's staying at trainor's villa. Mooney's going to coordinate security over there, and Rose is gonna stay with Heather English--miss April. So, what does Cassie bascomb have to say? I haven't talked to her yet. She just got back into town. That's where they found the knife. I don't understand why trainor didn't tell you some creep was following her in the first place. That makes two of US, moon. Hello. Detective stoner for miss bascomb. [ Phone buzzes ] Yes? Okay. Detective stoner? I'm Cassie bascomb. I've been expecting you. My desk is back here. Thanks. Well, here we are. Would you like some coffee or something? No, thanks, nothing. You knew I was coming. Yes. Richard told me. So, uh, this certainly is a far cry from the magazine. How long you been here? A couple of months, thanks to Richard. They handle his portfolio here. They're still not at all sure I'll fit the stockbroker's image. Well, then, uh, I guess you know that I want to ask you about that incident with what's-his-name. Albert stark? But it wasn't exactly an incident, Mr. Stoner. It was more like an ordeal. When did this happen? About four months ago. Did you call the police?Oh, yes. But all they could do was warn him. Do you have any idea why trainor would be reluctant to talk about this? I was pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing. Anyway, I left town for a while and I didn't fulfill my obligation to paradise. What obligation is that? I was angel of the year, if you'll pardon the expression. I had some promotional work and things to do. But I was pretty much of a basket case. Well, you seem to have your feet on the ground now. It's the suit and the glasses, Mr. Stoner, I assure you. Listen, this is my card. You call me if you think of something, okay? Okay. By the way, who handled your complaint? Who'd you talk to downtown? Um, sergeant romney. But you could speak to Alan Conti at paradise. Why? I thought you knew. Stark worked for Conti in the photo lab. That's where we met. Conti: Stark took these about eight months ago. Stoner: Was she ever involved with stark? No, she was just sort of complimented that some guy from pictorial wanted to shoot her. I'm sure he came on like some hotshot photographer. Here she was, just a few months on the job as a secretary. So now he took some pictures of her, and you showed 'em to trainor. That's right. And the rest is history. We run a big campaign about how she was discovered right in our own typing pool. She's goes straight to the top. Of course, the guy who really discovered her is left out in the cold when-- well, when Richard starts taking an interest in it. Was that when stark began following her? No, he just started bugging her at first, which is why Richard finally fired him. That's what flipped him out. He broke in here and stole the pictures he'd taken, which were technically ours. Tried to sell 'em to some gossip sheet, along with a story about how Richard had stolen his girl. There he is. So why wasn't he arrested for stealing the film? To keep it all from being dragged out in court, I guess. What about her? That's a good question. What do you mean? It looked as though they would be an item. You'd expect Richard to be all over a girl like this. Then poof--next thing we know, Cassie's left town. There's this dark cloud hanging over the villa. Well, what happened-- the thing with stark? I don't know. About the only thing I can tell you for sure about Cassie bascomb is... Don't fall in love with her. I...lied to you. Hmm. Can you sit down? It wasn't that I lied exactly. It's just that I didn't tell you the whole story. Go on. You see, I knew Albert stark, and I...I let him take some pictures of me. I know. I talked to Alan Conti about it. I wasn't using stark. In fact, everyone said he was using me. He claimed to be my manager. He wanted more money. And he fell in love with you. Not really. He fell in love with what-- the makeup, the measurements. Is that what happened with trainor? Nothing happened with Richard trainor. I'm sorry, it's my job. I have to ask these questions. I know. It's just that everybody assumes the worst. Really makes me crazy sometimes. [ Sighs ] Anyway, how's the job going? Any breakthroughs? Not really. Guess it's not like in the movies, huh? A list of suspects, a hunch in the middle of the night. Boy, I wish. [ Phone rings ]Excuse me. Homicide. Stoner. Oh. Hi, honey. That much? Well, wait till I get home. We'll talk about it when I get home. Yeah, I'll see you soon. Bye-bye. Sorry. Well, so much for my big confession. I'll let you go now. Thanks for coming by. And don't think I assume the worst about you. I know. Good-bye, detective stoner. Good-bye. Oh. Don't work too hard. Well, here we are. My room's next store. Where's your father going to sleep? In the living room. How old are you, miss Hernandez? Dad. I'm 31, Mr. English. And your a police officer, so let me ask you a question. What do you think of young women who pose naked for money?Dad, stop it. No, I want to hear the answer. English: What about it, miss Hernandez? It depends on the magazine. [ Sarcastically ] Depends on the magazine. It's all pornography, and you know it. Daddy, stop it! I'm sorry. Why do you stay here? He needs me. Hey, Montana, right here. Let me see you go out. Back. Fading back. Long. Come on, go on! Run! [ Groans ] Sorry, Mrs. Swanton. Dan! You're wanted on the phone. Okay. It's Rose. Que pasa, mi amigo? Amiga.and what's happening is that I want off this case. Oh, Rose, don't get excited. I am not excited. I'm depressed. This whole house, this whole case is depressing. All right, talk to me, Rose. Look, Heather's father is a real dark character, okay? And there's religious literature all over the place, and I'm a nice catholic girl guarding a pinup. Well, just hang in there, will you, please? Dan, I don't want to go to this party. What party? Tomorrow night at the villa. Remember? I thought that was canceled. They couldn't. They've got people flying in from Europe and all over. Anyway, Heather wants to go shopping, get a manicure and everything. Yeah, so? So what am I supposed to wear to an orgy? [ Sighs ] It's not an orgy. Uh, go out, buy yourself a dress, get a nice new hairdo, and go to the party and enjoy yourself. You're gonna love it. Speak for yourself, Dan. And put Nancy back on the phone. Not on your life, Hernandez. Bye. So what's this about an orgy? It's not an orgy. It's a party at the trainor villa, and Rose just doesn't have a thing to wear. Wait a minute. Are you going to this party? With all these girls running around the pool? It's my job, baby. Where'd you get this, dad? Uh, a guy at the magazine gave it to me. That Cassie bascomb's a fox. What do you know about Cassie bascomb, you little twerp. [ Music playing ] Dan, we got the pool, the main hall, and the front gate covered. Stoner: Good. Stay put, then. Keep your eye on the girls. If you lose sight of 'em, tell a guy in the area to stay alert. We all appreciate what you're doing here, but could you and your men be a little less obvious? Yes, all right. We are trying to have a party here. Cleo: Who's that with Heather? Stoner: Hernandez? Is that you, Rose? No cracks, stoner. Es muy bonito. Where do you pack your rod? In my purse. Hey, Hernandez, what are you doing after the orgy? Excuse me. Mm-hmm. Ready? Okay, here we go. This is Meredith macrae. Moments ago, Richard trainor stated that despite the inflammatory headlines of the past few days, he is certain that nothing is going to mar tonight's festivities. The reason for this is because his total confidence in the police department. One not only look around to see the tight security measures here. Oh, this is nat couray. He's gonna be mceeing tonight's festivities. Let's see if we can get a word with him. Nat? [ Camera shutter clicking ] [ Music playing ] Hello.hello. What are you doing here?Looking for you. I thought you were through with all this. Selling securities. I am. Glass of champagne? No, I don't drink on duty, thank you. I don't suppose you dance on duty, either. Conti: Hey, Cassie, why don't you come over here? There's someone I want you to meet. Sorry, officer.That's all right. You have a nice night.Thank you. Detective stoner. Guardian of our little Babylon here. Uncovered any clues lately? Not lately, no. Oh, don't be coy, detective stoner. I understand you think Albert stark's the killer. He's just one of many suspects. Who else is? Well, how about you? Interesting. Why me? Why not? Uh, where is Mr. Trainor hiding? I thought this was his party. So did he, until Cassie bascomb showed up. Well, well, well, speak of the devil. Excuse me. Oh. Excuse me, but there's someone I'd like you to meet. [ Speaking Italian ] My fiancé. Sorry. Fianc--fiancé? Me? Why, I'm old enough to be your father. You are not. So, uh, Cleo tells me you're a party-crasher. Well, coming from Cleo, I take that as a compliment. Walk me around for a while. You can walk on duty, can't you? Sure. Come on. The world of paradise. It's so bizarre. It must seem strange to you. Aside from the girls, the food, and all the ferraris outside... [ Laughs ] There he goes again. He is such a jerk. I swear the only reason he's still around is because he owes Richard some money. Oh, he's a compulsive gambler. He wrote a fortune in ious at the club in Paris last year. There were also some, uh, bad business deals, I think. What kind? Oh, I don't know. All I know is that Richard owns his contract for about the next ten years. So he goes around mauling all the girls, hoping Richard will kick him out of the kingdom. At least, that's my theory. I would think mauling would come with the territory around here. Yeah? Well, what's sad is the guys you like never do the mauling. Well, if they did that, you wouldn't like 'em, right? Conti: Don't get in the pool yet. Just get near the pool. Come on, girls. The guys can come, too. That's all right. This is water volleyball. Anybody play it? [ Women cheering ] This is the volleyball. That's the water. We need teams. Let's have the blondes down here, the real blondes over here. Jenny, are you a real blonde? Get a suit. We need you. Cassie, what about you? You're a blonde. Come on, on the blonde team. [ Laughs ] What about you? Can you play volleyball on duty? It gets my gun wet. Conti: Smile. Lots of teeth. Um... What, do I got spinach on my tooth or what? I like you. I consider that a compliment, Cassie. Well, you are married, aren't you? Yes, I am. What if I told you I don't care? I'd have to tell you I do. Well...i guess it's time for a little volleyball. Thanks for the walk, Dan. You're welcome. Come on, Cassie, get your suit on. Cassie! That's it. Pick up some water, will you? Just splash it for me a little bit. Give me the wet look. That's a great outfit. It's fetching. Woman: Who turned out the lights? Check the lights. We lost the lights. Keep your eyes open. [ Woman screaming ] [ Screaming, laughing ] Gail? Where's Gail? Someone's in the pool.Who is it? Give me a hand. Somebody help him. Is she still breathing? [ Gasps ] Seal off the area. Give me some towels. Get a blanket, somebody. Towels, blankets. The towel's right here. [ Gail coughing ] [ Coughing ] We got you. No, because after the lights went out, it was impossible to see anything. Dan, here's another one. The police were in evidence throughout the party. Yes, they were, but if it hadn't been for them, especially for detective stoner, Gail probably would have been dead. Thank you, Cassie. Gail keating is currently listed in good condition at mission hospital, but as far as we know, the police still have no suspects in the case. Meredith macrae reporting. No suspects. We've got too many suspects. We even checked out trainor's ex-wife. Trainor has an ex-wife? Uh, he did. She died 15 years ago in a wreck. So who does that leave? Well, apart from stark, there's nat couray, who owes trainor mucho dinero. Alan Conti cannot account for his whereabouts at the time. And, uh, Cleo banks, trainor left standing at the altar. But you said that was years ago. Yeah, but Cassie says she's still bitter. And, of course, there's trainor himself. Well, how do you figure that? I don't know. Just something about the guy. Like guilt. [ Laughs ] Was everybody in the pool last night? Yeah, everybody but, uh, Cleo. She was in the spa, alone. What about Cassie bascomb? What about her? You said there was something between her and trainor. Yeah, well, I guess I was wrong. What's she like? Cassie? She's all right. A little confused. Well, I think your son's in love with her. Why do you say that? Well, I found this magazine that you brought home under his bed. That ain't love, babe. That's hormones. [ Phone rings ] Yeah, stoner. Hey, moon, how you doing? Stoner: Was anything taken? Cassie: Nothing, as far as I can tell. What time did you get back? About 1:00, I guess. Well, I want all your locks changed. Until we find this guy, I'm gonna have someone outside guarding you around the clock. You? [ Phone rings ] You sure nothing's missing?Pretty sure. My jewelry's still here. Stereo. Well, it's not the stereo he's after, cass. It's you. I'd check your personal things--records-- Dan, just got a current on Albert stark. He lives in echo park. Let's go get him. I gotta go. There's two guys posted outside. Don't leave home without them. Dan, you hungry? So-so. Try one these, man. Pizza nuggets. [ Chuckles ] No, I'm trying to clean out my body. Eat good stuff. A little chicken, a little fish, no red meat. Lot's of vegetables... Steamed. Well, these are real good. You oughta try one. [ Clears throat ] Smells good. Mm-hmm. I always have them for breakfast. Oh, what the hell. One can't hurt, right? Mooney: Is that stark? Stark naked. What's he got in his hand? Big Manila envelope. Let's go. [ Starts engine ] Al, it's me. Open up. Who is it? It's me from the photo lab. I've got some good news. I lied, al. Open up. Police. [ Engine starts ] Ambition is "to be successful, powerful, "and live in beautiful surroundings with people I love." Stoner: We also found a phony press pass dated the 17th, the night that Pam cummings was killed. And a receipt from a copy place. Stark went there to copy something according to the manager-- a book. You missing a book? No. Do you think he's the killer? I don't know. But he's been at the scene every time, though, hasn't he? Yeah, but it doesn't make any sense. Why would he attack Gail and then tear this place apart? To warn me that I'm next. That's what you think. No, that's what Tony thinks. I'm gonna have a very tall drink. You want one?Sure. [ Soft music playing ] So why do you want to know? I was just curious is all. What goes on in your head when you're doing it? You mean, uh... When I'm posing or afterwards, when I look at the pictures. Either way. Well, first of all, the, um, session itself is very professional. You know, the lights and the technicians. And you want to look good, of course. And you want to look seductive, too, right? Sure. Every woman wants to be seductive at the right time... With the right man. So...what happens now? With the case, you mean. [ Laughs ] Okay. About the case. Uh, you make me nervous, you know? Sorry. The case. What's the next move? A celebrity field day. What? Games, celebrity games-- that kind of thing. Tony thought it would bring stark out of his hole. Oh. What do you think? Well, I think he's interested in you. [ Laughs ] Well, then I'll be thereno, you won't. Ah, so... You really do care. Of course I care. I mean-- oh, don't get the wrong idea now.What's that? I mean, it's, uh--what? Come on. I'll think of something. Like? [ Laughs ] Uh...uh-huh? I gotta go. You could lie. I've never been very good at that. Night, cass. I think we are ready for a great afternoon here at the sixth annual paradise sports festival. What do you say, gang? Can you believe these lovely ladies? Now these are my chains, that I lent them, and I like to say that. My car chains is what I meant. I'm very proud of them. I'm still waiting to give one of these ladies some first aid. It doesn't matter, I'm not picky. This is the 100 yard relay. Pink leads it at the wall now. The blue team takes the lead. Look at that teamwork. Forget the Lakers. Give me these angels. Blue team ties it with a victory--ouch. Up and over. I've tried to get my wife to do this right here. No chance of that, none at all. The blue angels' specialty is definitely the horizontal bars. And look at Alicia go beautiful! The blue angels now with a slim-- and I mean slim five-point lead as we prepare for the stretch. Ladies, stretch those muscles. Our final relay is coming up next. Okay, I'm gonna try it now. All right, hello. Uh, we finally had to draw straws. So, uh, anyway, your master of ceremonies for the day, uh, who's going to have his hands full keeping his eye on the finish line-- Mr. Entertainment himself, nat couray. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you very much. We gotta welcome all the TV crews... All right, this is the wide one, so give me the whole thing. Let me see it all. That a girl. Let me see it. Let me see your best side now. Good side. Good stuff. Stick it out there. That's it. Good. I like it. That's nice. All right. Let me see you with that car now. See you with that car. I mean it, Heather. You hit the dirt at the first sign of anything. Don't go into the crowd. I won't, I won't. Okay, mom? All right, ladies, we're all set. I want you in the middle Lane in all events. Keep your eye on Rose at all times. What about Cassie?What about her? She's taking Gail's place.She's what? Not only today, but in the centerfold. Where is she? ...right over there on the south end of the festival ground. Immediately following this afternoon's finale, we will all gather at the... Conti: Best side. Good, good. Stick it out. Muscles. That's enough for now, Alan. What do you think you're doing? I'm helping out. No one else would, and I figured-- now, wait a minute. I figured I could use the extra 20,000, which I can. What's your idea, coming out here and getting undressed for the magazine? Was that a moral question, or are you just concerned about my safety? Listen, I don't know what you're doing, but you wait until we wrap things up here. And then if you want to dangle yourself in front of trainor, you go right ahead. It's not trainor, you idiot! The top three finishes in each five-man team-- did I say "man"? Was that a slip of the tongue. Ladies, this is not exactly miss america's runway, is it? But they're heading for the competition. Keep your eyes on what's going on. Five points for first, three for second, one for third. You add 'em up... Dan, can you come in for a second? Stoner. It looks like we got a problem. A brown Van just pulled up above the hill, above center field. Can you make out the driver? No, I can't really make him out. What do you think? Nat: Okay, girls, let's get set. Are we all set? You just tell me when. Yeah, we're set. [ Announcer talking ] All right, it's probably nothing. ...fill up with some very beautiful females. But, uh, let's be safe and quiet about this. Send smitty up there and ask politely for a driver's license. I got it. This is a 500-meter tag team race, five ladies each running 100 meters. You never know, we might have a big surprise here in our grand finale. Will all the girls please gather at the starting line? Media people, hold up your cameras. This is a big event. Ladies, please see the man in gray for your final instructions. [ Applause ] On your Mark, get set... [ Bang ] Go! Talk to me, moon. Mooney: Smitty's pulling up to him right now. Dan, watch out. The guy's coming down the hill. [ Gunshots ] [ Sirens ] [ Starts engine ] [ Siren ] Hey, hey, slow down! Look out! [ Siren stops ] [ Siren stops ] Dan, get back! Out of the way! This is it? From the whole Van? That's it. Except for some burned negatives and a toolbox. This guy must be real sentimental. He's not even in there. I already looked. [ Scoffs ] What do you want me to do with all this stuff? Why don't you put it in a box for stoner? Okay. Hey, wait a minute. Heather English is the one that told me about stark. You kept your mouth shut. I was trying to protect Cassie. You're the one who asked her to replace Gail keating. Who told you that? She did. Are you going to deny that? Dan, the press is on the way over. What I don't understand is why you didn't put stark against the wall when you had a chance. I told you, it would have been a nightmare for Cassie. Why a nightmare? Why? Well, pictures would have been smeared across every newspaper in the country. She was already very upset. Down the hall. Come on! How's stark, sergeant? Have you had a chance to talk to him yet? No, not yet. He's unconscious. Have murder charges been filed?Not at this time. Are you saying this wasn't attempted murder? I don't know what to call it. All I can tell you is he was unarmed. What's your gut feeling about this guy? Is he your man or not? All right. Uh, what we have is a peeping Tom. Now, it happens he was at the hotel the night Pam cummings was killed. He also was at trainor's villa when Gail keating was attacked. So as far as I know, we may have the best witness. That's all I have to say. This has to be what the guy was talking about. He said he copied a book or something. Why take it to the field games? Maybe it's Cassie bascomb's. No, no. I called her from the office. And I checked Kara Alexander and Pam cummings' photograph, not to mention Gail and, uh, Heather and all the others. You know, this really is police work. I ought to be paid for it. Yeah, we'll bill forensics in the morning. Meantime, I need it now. Like I said, not much. Well... Officer Tully, please report to the nurses' station. Officer Tully. [ Flatline tone ] Did it not occur to the guy it might be a diversion? What the hell are we doing here? Yeah. I'll see you later. Any witnesses?No. Bye. I forgot to remind your father we're not going to be home tonight. I'm taking you to camp. Dan! The head icu nurse found him about 7:00 this morning. Nurse Cody, you're wanted on the third-floor nurses' station. Hi, king.How you doing? Sorry, Dan, there's nothing for US here. You get that box of stuff from the Van? Yeah, I did. [ Phone rings ]I'll get it. King. Got him right here, Tony. Yeah? No, it's a washout here, Tony. King says there's nothing. Dr. Frank cutler... Oh, really? Is that right? Couray, huh? Yeah, he's under surveillance. All of them are. Yeah, sure. Hey, that's great. Yeah, okay, bye. We got US a break. Got US a break! King: Wait a minute. What happened? The hotel clerk just found out about stark's departure and got scared. He was lying. Nat couray rented that room for Pam cummings. See you later. Morning. I know what you're gonna say, and it's not my fault. I thought your guy might have been the killer. What are you talking about? Him across the street? One of yours, no doubt. I spot him outside my condo last night, so I call the guard. Why didn't you just tell me I was still under surveillance? It's just a precaution. That's all it is. Tony wants me to pick up the hotel clerk. He wants you to stay with Cassie till we figure out security. What's this? Did stark escape? He was murdered last night. Better go.Yeah. Take Mr. Incognito over there with you. So, you think a hotel clerk had something to do with this. No, it's couray we're after. He rented that room for Pam cummings that night, then followed her up there. Come on, let's go. To my place? Yeah. This yours?Yeah. So what do you want for dinner? Hmm. Wanna race for pink slips? [ Revs engine ] [ Tires squeal ] [ Honking horn ] Cassie! Open up! [ Honking ] I want to talk to you! [ Honking ] Are you all right?What'd you take off for? You think this is some kind of game we're playing here? Come on.You just be quiet. Get up. Yeah, well, what was he doing at Cassie bascomb's? Waiting for Dan. He says he called here, but Dan was out. Why didn't he just call the broker? He did, but the receptionist told him Cassie had left. That part's been confirmed. What's Dan say to all this? That's garbage. You know it, I know it. Why else would I come, huh? Please, you tell me. Tell me. I don't want to interrupt anything here. Why didn't you just wait outside for Cassie? Because some dame with a poodle came up and asked for my autograph. I just wanted to see you privately. I didn't want to sign autographs for people in the street. So a guy, he pulled into the garage, and I pulled in behind him. And what's wrong with that? So what'd you do? You bribed him like you bribed the room clerk, right? All right, I did that. That was wrong. But I didn't kill these girls. Why? Because you owed trainor your soul for five years. [ Laughs ] I don't understa-- that's crazy. How much was it anyway? I mean, how much did you lose? Well, it wasn't all gambling, you know. Some of it was, um, real estate deals that went sour. How much? I don't wanna--how much?! $3 million. Three million. Three million. Three million. What the hell, huh? Why didn't you tell the lieutenant here about your little tryst with Pam cummings? He doesn't like to register under his own name because of groupies. Oh, groupies. Why'd you register under hers? Because she wanted it that way in case her parents called. So--okay. So you register under her name, you give her the key, and you follow her upstairs. So then what happens? No, I didn't follow her up all the way. Look, in the first place, she took the elevator, I took the back stairs. I was-- I was a little jumpy because after all, this was a 19-year-old kid, right? So anyway, I crossed the lobby. She took the elevator and I went up the back stairwell. I was--i was climbing the stairs, and then I heard something. [ Running footsteps ] [ Woman screaming ] [ Crying ] But you didn't get a good look at who came down the stairs. No, but they saw me. Either it was the murderer or Albert stark. I don't like the timing on this, Dan. He goes out because he hears screams, and the real murderer slips down the stairs. No, no, no, I got off the stairway. I went into the hallway because I heard someone coming down the stairs. So you ran down to the lobby, overwhelmed with grief, and you bribed the room clerk. No. Listen, I don't have to take any more of this. I came in here voluntarily, without even a lawyer. Oh, take it easy. I'm not gonna say anything more. It's over. All right, all right. Escort Mr. Coraggio back to his cell. Who?that's his real name. Everybody changes their name in this business. Or is that a crime around here, too? When you change it from Italian to French, it is. So what do you think, Dan? Everybody changes their names in this business. What? Uh, nothing. See you guys later. [ Seagulls calling ] Good morning. This is Meredith macrae. Police today announced a major break in the calendar girl murder case. Arrested was nat couray, the well-known entertainer and close friend of Richard trainor. Taken into custody last night, couray refused comment except to say that he's innocent of all charges against him. Shown here being escorted to police headquarters after his arraignment, couray has apparently admitted some connection with the first victim, Pamela cummings, who was killed by a fall from the tenth floor of the centennial hotel. Morning, cass. You look terrible. Been up all night with couray. Well, come on in. I'll get you some coffee. No, I can't. I, uh, just wanted to say good-bye. Good-bye? Just like that? Well, the d.A.'S boys are mopping up now. Did couray confess? No, not yet, but he will. So this is it, huh? Sorry it couldn't have been different. Me, too. I understand Gail's back. They're gonna shoot her centerfold tonight instead of you. Trainor's always looking for a prettier, younger face, isn't he? Oh, well. Take care, Cassie. Dan. It was never real, was it? You and me. No. No, I don't like these. [ Phone rings ] Well, maybe. [ Ring ] Yes? Oh, uh, just a minute. Detective stoner. Yes, sergeant. Congratulations. I was just saying to Cleo that you're, uh... I beg your pardon? Well, wait a minute. Um, Gail keating hasn't-- what about her? I'd like to talk about this because it, uh, isn't what it appears to be. All right, whatever you say. The garage? Yes, of course. We'll be there. [ Sirens ] [ Gasps ] Dan. God, you scared me. Sorry, Rose. Couray's the killer. Tony thinks that these new pictures will prove it. What pictures? The guy who cleans out the county ambulances found a photo claim slip with stark's name on it. It's dated the day after Pam cummings was killed. You saw these pictures?They're negatives. But in one of them you can see the centennial Plaza hotel. Nancy's blowing them up right now.Nancy's what? I called looking for you, and she volunteered. She's worried about you, Dan. Are you all right? Couray's not the killer, Rose. Then who is? A girl named Julie wersen. Wersen? I know that name. Yeah, yeah. It's, uh, the name of trainor's ex-wife and his daughter. He has a daughter? He claims he didn't know she was his daughter when she first came to work for him. Didn't know until she was angel of the year. Cassie? People change their names. Dan, are you sure about this? She killed stark 'cause he knew, and she was afraid he was going to blackmail her. Oh, god, Dan. What? When I couldn't find you, I called Cassie. She knows about the negatives, Dan, and that Nancy's alone.Oh, no, Rose. No. [ Phone rings ] [ Ring ] This better be you, Daniel. Hello. Hello. Cassie... It's over. [ Sirens ] [ Crying ] All I ever wanted was a father. But you were never there. It's okay, baby, it's over. It's over. [ Sighs ] Nan says you caught a 14-inch rainbow. Yeah, it was good fishing, Tony. How you feeling? Fine, thanks. Have a good vacation up there? Terrific vacation. Thanks for asking. Oh, you heard about Heather English, didn't you? [ Laughs ] Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think she'll make a hell of a cop. Yeah, I think you're right. Uh, listen, uh... I got the psychiatric report. Oh, yeah? Was I right? Hmm? Oh! Yeah, pretty much. This thing at the racetrack is bugging me. You read about that?Yeah, Tony. We were talking about the psychiatric report on Cassie. Oh, well, the usual things. Love-hate thing with her father and, uh... I mean, this jockey kid shows up with his neck broken just after winning the piedmont stakes. The psychiatric report, Tony? Uh, uh, abandoned when she was a kid, you know, then rejected again when trainor shows up and finds out who she is. It's a hell of a thing. You know what's even weirder? Second place jockey just got lunched today. Is, uh, Cassie's report in your office? Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen-- I'm gonna go read it. There's just one thing we didn't know, though, Dan. Yeah, Cassie's been having what they call these psychotic episodes ever since she was a kid. Jockey had more dope in him than the horse. I'll bet you anything the gang's mixed up in this. Rita can't seem to-- hell of a looker. Is this the psychiatric report here? Old man owns more of the republics down in Central America. Get the name of the horse, Dan. I just want to look at the psychiatric-- name of the horse is Satan's curse. How in the hell does a jockey... Hello! Tony.
