THE NEST THE NEST OPEN THE FILE Hi, Pierre. Welcome to "the nest". What do you think? It's old... borderline ramshackle, it lacks light... Smells musty. OK, I know, it's not exactly the cabin deep in the woods you were expecting but... I think... for the creation of our project, the place is much more inspiring. Inspiring for the sequel of The Shining maybe. In any case, whether you like it or not, you're stuck here for 5 days, without a cellphone, or any contact with the outside world. As discussed, I'll tell you one truth a day and you'll react to it in a video that we will insert in the movie. A true work of art with no limits. Our project. One video per day. It's our opportunity to make the film that we've always wanted to make. Don't screw it all up OK? Don't be stupid. Bear Paws ! Truth number one: I honestly believe that I love you. You are, to this day, the partner I have loved the most. You are my longest relationship. That should be a good sign, right? But, what do you think is best, for a relationship? Short and intense or long and boring? Could I love you more? Or could I love another man more than you? Yes, I think so. But the chances of finding that person is slim. So we settle for what we have. You see, I'm almost in my 40s and my life is not exactly what I was hoping it would be. I need to think and make important decisions. I care about this experiment, Pierre. I need to know what we're worth, you and I. I've been patient. Too much, even. I can't stand seeing the man that you've become anymore. I feel like I'm living with a stranger. People tell me... to stop dreaming, to stop living in the past, and they're probably right. But I remain hopeful. How do I wash myself? So, I'll leave you to explore your comfy nest for the next few days. Settle in. I'll wait for your first video, today. See you tomorrow morning. Can I have some beer? Diary of a man lost between four walls. My name is Pierre-Luc. I'm a director, actor... jack of all trades. My girlfriend pretty much does the same. Which is actually how we met... a long time ago. Long enough to know that I really hate olives. Olives are traitors aren't they? It always looks good, but in the end, when you taste it... Nope. It's pretty much like our project right now. Hey Pierre-Luc! Wanna make a movie? It will be super cool. But in the end... I'm the only one stuck in this rat hole. Not you. PL PLAYS THE PIANO IN BLACK AND WHITE I'd like to dedicate this next song to the love of my life. My morning sparrow who reminds me day after day, that we can end all the misery in this world with your gaze alone. And that without you, I'm quite meaningless. Hello? Fuck! Hello? Fuck! Isabelle? It's going to freaking stink when I get out of here. I'm not convinced it will help with getting closer. NEW VIDEO FROM ISABELLE Good morning Pierre-Luc. Nice first video. I feel it will be an interesting movie. Considering your good work, there's a surprise waiting for you in the fridge. Alright, moving on to serious business this morning. I'd like to remind you that everything I say is for the good of this experiment and our relationship. Truth number two: I cheated on you... with a calendar fireman. What? So... PL DON'T CARE PRODUCTIONS PRESENT PL IN THE NEST STARRING PL AS THE SEXY FIREMAN THE END Hey! No! No! Fuck! I'm taking a shit! Crazy fuck! WELCOME Hello everyone. Since what you're watching is quite boring, I have decided to offer you some entertainment. You will witness a live game of beer bowling. The rules are simple. Each cup represents a bowling pin. The player is allowed two throws. In the end, the player must drink all pins still standing. Of course, each player is allowed a practice throw. Seven years old, ten years old. Art class, senior year of high school. This one I have no clue why it's there. Good morning. You didn't do a thing yesterday. Super. There's a price to pay. I hope you've had enough to eat. Yeah, OK, you learned that I cheated on you, so you get drunk, I get it. So that's how it's going to be? You're being selfish. So I left you a little present in the kitchen. You can call it whatever you want. There is food for it. Don't forget to fill the water tank. It's your new friend. So take care of it. I sure hope you can do that. Truth number three: My shrink helped me realize... that for years I have avoided leaving you alone with Magalie. That I was scared you'd be negligent. That she'd fall down the stairs. That she'd swallow a small object. That you'd forget to feed her. I thought it was my maternal instinct that was making me act that way. Actually, I didn't trust you. Hello Isabelle, the perfect mom, who always took such good care of her daughter. Like that one time you left all alone in the basement, with paint. Let me refresh your memory. Jackson Pollock! PL DON'T CARE PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS ISABELLE AT THE SHRINK Come on Isabelle, tell me what's going on. Oh, I've done a terrible thing, I cheated on Pierre-Luc, I feel dirty and ashamed. Calm down Isabelle. You're jumping to conclusions too soon. Is it really your fault? Isn't it Pierre-Luc's fault? Oh, I don't know, Pierre-Luc was not there. Exactly! He was not there. Which means he was absent. Oh Isabelle. My poor Isabelle. You're merely a victim. You're right, it's not my fault. It's Pierre-Luc's fault. Thank you doctor, you're so good to me. You understand me. I don't know how to thank you. It's easy, first a check or you can pay cash. Then, well... I see that Pierre-Luc is not here... Again... Oh, I see. look what I found... Oh, I'm hot. Isabelle? What's going on here? Pierre-Luc! What are you doing here? It's not what you think, it's your fault. Hum... Are you hungry? You know I wish I could eat pellets too. I was thinking. I should give you a name. Since I'm stuck with you, I might as well give you an identity. I was thinking Wilson... But... I'm worried people would make the link with a certain movie. So... I've decided to call you Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks, that not bad. What do you think? 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. It's only an alarm. You will tell me if someone comes tonight, right? I'm counting on you to protect me. He has changed so much. Changed so much. When I look at him, all I see is my little girl. I need to talk about it. Otherwise... But for him, it's the opposite. He's totally... in denial. What are you doing? Every time, you don't do what I ask... You don't understand, it's... Act like a grown up for once. OK, here's the last truth: What do you think she'll make up this time? Maybe... a critical illness? Cancer? Brain tumor? Heart disease? She's been living a double life for 10 years and has two kids with a rich business man who travels to Montreal twice a year because he also lives a double life. He has three kids with a woman but he doesn't know that she's also living a double life... with another woman. She really has low self-esteem and that goes back to childhood. In fact, she never really felt like a woman. But now, thanks to her shrink, she was finally able to conclude she's really a man, in a woman's body. She's a serial killer and I was supposed to be her hundredth victim. But because she fell in love with me she didn't dare to cut my throat and watch me drown in my own blood. Because that's what she enjoys, watching life slowly leave her victim's eyes. Anyway, my love for her impressed her so much that she forgot to kill people. But after a few years she couldn't take it anymore so she decided to lock me here to make sure she wouldn't kill me and she went out, meandering through alleys in search of her next victim. She killed one per day for seven days and on the seventh day, finally satisfied, she will open the door and I will be safe for 1 year. If you have any better ideas feel free to share. Tom? OK, I want to leave this place, now! The crazy fireman with an axe. That's a no go. You've had a fair share of shitty ideas but I admit this time you have surpassed yourself. So OK, listen to me. This is serious. I want to leave, now! Go. Thank you. Pierre, it's not over. You can't leave. I don't know what's going on. I don't know how you are doing this, but we said five days. That's it! I won't let this happen. Nice performance yesterday. It was clear, it worked. Now here's what I have to say: Eat shit! There, I hope I'm being clear too! I will make your movie, But if you touch Isabelle one more time... I will kill you asshole! It better be a fucking act. Oh no, Tom Hanks. "PL WANTS OUT" PRODUCTION PRESENTS PL IN THE NEST TOM HANKS' FUNERAL SCENE 1 OUTLINE PSYCHOLOGIST Hello doctor. How are you feeling today Pierre-Luc? I'm doing OK. I had cash and time to waste so I told myself: I will murder a small helpless mouse, and after I'll go see a psychiatrist to clear my mind. Did you torture small animals when you were young? No, I'd make frogs smoke before putting them in the microwave. Denial. Uses humor to escape reality. Did your father beat you? I never knew my father. That's a shame... He would've beaten you. And... how do you feel about not knowing your father? Well, sometimes I wake up in the morning and have stomach cramps and I tell myself it will pass eventually but then it doesn't and it hurts, and so I tell myself: it must be because I never knew my father. Exactly! You should have been a psychiatrist. You're talented. It takes talent to become a psychiatrist? I want out! I want to go! Isa? I can't take it anymore! I can't take it anymore! Magalie! Magalie! look, I bought you a gift. Oh, Daddy, you bought me a mouse! But where is it? I don't see it. It's invisible. You know Mommy does not like mice. Shhh! She's coming... Diary of a man lost between 157 walls... I don't know what to think anymore. I just want out of here. Isabelle you're truly mentally ill if you are the one organizing all this. look, I care about you, I just... I just want proof that you're fine. OK? I'm sick of this! Not the old doll! It's my childhood doll. Throw that away. It's creepy. No. It could be useful. At some point. Useful for what? It will be useful. No way! No way! No. NEW VIDEO FROM ISABELLE Magalie! Magalie answer me! Daddy! Daddy! Magalie? I'm here! Magalie? Magalie? Daddy! Magalie? Magalie! Magalie I told you not to play in here, that's too hot. Come, come. Magalie! Magalie! Magalie where are you? I can't see you! Come here Little Mouse! Magalie! Magalie, answer me! NEW VIDEO FROM ISABELLE ISABELLE'S MOVIE Hi Pierre. Welcome to the nest. Fuck! I'm taking a shit. It will be OK. We'll come feed you if he forgets. Here's the last truth: If all this leads to nothing, I will have to go. Come on there's no reason to be scared it's in a cage. It's not what I meant. Why didn't you ask me? No, it's pointless. look, as soon as she's in bed, just get rid of it. I just can't! No. No. It's pointless, I can't. No. -No, no. It's... -It's pointless, I can't. As soon as she's in bed, you get rid of it. Seriously? You want to do that to your daughter? What am I supposed to do, flush it in the toilet? I don't know, I don't care. I don't want it. Bring it back to the store. We'll give her something else. And call back the guy for the furnace. Bring it back to the store. Bring it back to the store. We'll give her something else. No, No. No, no. It's pointless, I can't do it. Magalie! She's stuck in her room. I don't know why she's not coming out! The fire started around 3 a.m. last night. There's too much smoke! Magalie open the door! Magalie, open the fucking door! I can't see a thing! Magalie! Magalie! Near the furnace... -My daughter is inside. -A neighbor called 911. When the fire department arrived at the scene, they were able to rescue the woman and her husband. Unfortunately, they were unable to save their 4 year-old girl who was sleeping downstairs. Here's the last truth: If all this leads to nothing, I will have to go. I don't see any other option... And I know you'll come join me... not long after. Is that what we want? I know you feel responsible for Magalie's death. Off course you do, You are. But you have to accept it. You were an amazing father to your little mouse. You should know that. That's what matters. That's why we're making our movie. We couldn't keep that inside. Some do couple's therapy... Some see shrinks individually... Some break up. I think this is it. Want to see? We could have done any of those things. But that's not like us. We made a movie. THE NEST A FILM BY DAVID PARADIS A FILM BY DAVID PARADIS Subtitling: Hiventy
