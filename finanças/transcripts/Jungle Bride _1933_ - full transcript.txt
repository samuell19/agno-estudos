Eddie? What rhymes with care? Is it a four-letter word? Oh, you're a big help. Well, let's get an inspiration. Maybe we can think of something. Come on, cheerio, everybody. Lackaday. Wait a minute. I'll go ask Franklin. Say, copper, uh, Gordon wants to know what rhymes with care. Electric chair. [laughter] Right. Is that cop nasty? (Gordon) Uh, he's not a cop. He's a reporter. Well, he acts like a cop. He carries a gun, and all he can think about is taking you back to the electric chair. Oh, and there's your rhyme. Chair, uh-- - Care. - Care, there you are. Great. That's it. Let's see. Wait a minute. I'm lily-white from now on 'cause I'm headed for the electric chair. It's disgusting. Why, what's the matter, darling? He certainly is having a lot of fun at your expense. Get out the way and make room for the musicians. Yeah, you know, that was alright, but one thing. Why don't you tune it once in a while? - Tune what? - This, you're not playing.. Why didn't you lock him up? Well, I will, dear. About a day before we reach port. After all, he's only being taken back for trial. He hasn't been convicted, you know. Well, my brother's been locked up. For a crime, Gordon Wayne committed. (Eddie) And here's one. Take a card. Any one at all. - That one? Alright. - Yeah. Well, look at it, stoop. Can't do a trick if you don't look at it. Put it back. - Now, shuffle 'em. - You shuffle 'em. There you are. It's your card. A jack of club. And clubs means cops. [laughter] [bell ringing] Well, I'm going down to dress for the captain's dinner party tonight. Alright, darling. I'll meet you in the salon, as soon as I round up Wayne. Alright. [indistinct chatter] - Good evening, Ms. Evans. - Good evening. There's a pretty girl. Pretty mean. Hounding poor Gordon Wayne. Tracking him all the way to Cape Town and bringing him back. Oh, honey. It isn't she. That reporter she's engaged to. Well, she's engineering the whole thing. Hey, you would too, if your brother was held for murder and the guilty man escaped. You know how far newspaper go to get a good story? Yes, and I know how far a woman will go too. [all singing in unison] [singing in unison] [indistinct] [all cheering] (Gordon) Wait a minute. There's another little song. My sweet little girl. Thank you. Alright, Wayne. Come on, let's get going. Aw, leave him alone. Hey, folks. Folks, I've got an idea. Uh, I move that we lap the star reporter up for the balance of the trip. What do you think? [all laughing] [chatter continues] Oh, pardon me. Have you seen Mr. Franklin? I believe he's in the bar room. Oh, the bar. Oh, thank you. [chatter continues] Come on, Wayne. It's getting late. I'm new in the game. Say, copper, why, why don't you buy us a drink? Alright. Waiter. Black coffee for the crowd. (all) Ohh. Coffee? You're a bum sport. I rather power around with a murderer. So that's how it is, huh? How would you all like to hear a story? - Tell us all about it, Gordon. - Shoot the oration. Oration? That's a great idea. A funeral oration, by the corpus delicti. [guitar music] And you, my friends, you'll be the judge and the jury. [crowd cheering] [bangs on table] Order in the courtroom. Friends.. ...Romans, and gentlemen of the press. Lend me your ears. But yesterday the word of Gordon Wayne might have stood against the world. I'll stand thee here with none to do him justice. For Franklin has said that Wayne is guilty. And Franklin is an honorable man. [all laughing] If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all remember well the tale. A police man was shot. Young Evans arrested. Turns state's evidence. And said that Wayne did the killing. And Wayne is fled. And.. ...Young Evans is an honorable man. He comes from generations of honorable people. So is his sister an honorable man. [all laugh] The public inspired by the press clamors for a Roman holiday. Then the press is deputized to bring Wayne back to the bar of justice. Ah, speaking of bars. Let's all have a drink. [crowd clamoring] One man's word against another. And what chances Wayne. It's tough, alright. But of course, you made a mistake in running away. 'Sure.' Why don't you bluff it on? Are those your sentiments? Oh, we're for you anyway. You probably had to kill him. There's a jury for you. The verdict is... guilty. Uh, come on. Let's all have a drink. [crowd chattering] - You'll never even see a jury. - I'll tell you why. [indistinct chatter] Here's some for you and here's.. Why don't you have some coffee? Good evening, Captain Andersen. Oh, good evening. Aren't you ever going to dinner? Well, just as soon as they finish their coffee, dear. What he needs is a wife, to manage him. That what I think, and that's what I want. How about it, captain? Can you marry her? (Andersen) 'Uh, do like to-to oblige.' It will be a fine climax for my party this evening. Oh. [rumbling] [indistinct shouting] Step by fire, don't look ahead. Make a turn. I beg pardon, sir. [indistinct] [indistinct] [explosion] [screaming] [horn blowing] [screaming] [horn blowing] 'Stand back!' [screaming] [whistles] Ladies, children, first. [gunshot] Stand back. [horn blowing] [explosion] (Gordon) 'Hey.' Don't throw that away. I can fix it. That's alright. Keep it. I wonder where we are. Somewhere along the coast of Africa. No sign of anything. Yeah, it's tough alright. Well, the first thing to do is to make her comfortable. To make camp, back in the jungle. It's...ruined. Great. Come here. If you can get some wood, we'll build a fire and dry our clothes out. Okay...Africa. Here. Let's make a camp back there. And I'll see what I know about some food. - Can you walk alright? - Very well. [squawking] [screeching] - That looks good. - It's gotta be good. But, uh, what is it? Well, you can call it quail on toast. We couldn't mind if we had some toast. Yeah, and if we had some quail. Say, Eddie. Hmm? You think you can dig up some sort of a plate and take this over to the lady? - All of it? - All of it. Okay, chef. - Oh, Ms. Evans? - Yes. Will you have some nice roast Turkey? Or something? Thank you. [monkey whooping] [quail chirping] [man screaming] Help! Help! Franklin. It had to be you. Wouldn't you know it. Come on, Eddie, let's get him up out of the water. Where-where's Doris? She's safe. We've made a camp. Here. Here. Water. Did you see anyone else? Captain was on the part of the ship that stayed afloat. I was washed off and then I.. ...managed to tie myself to that boat. Eddie, go back and look it over. See if there's anything we can use. Okay, Gordon. - Oh, God. - Oh, John. Oh, I'm so glad. Come on. Come on. Let's move to camp. How does she look? She's pretty badly stove in, Gordon. There ought to be a lot of supplies somewhere. Oh, boy. Let me at it. (Eddie) We're not doing so bad. We have plates. And we have salt. We have...hard tack. We have tea. Barrels of tea. Breakfast tea. I wonder if it's alright for supper. I guess we can take a chance. Hey, see what's in the duffle bag. Alright. Smells good. [chuckles] How's this for a fit? Too small. That's what I thought. [monkey whooping] And look. A razor and blades. Great. In a week we'd look like the Smith brothers. Why, that's Adam and Eve. How are you, pals? How is the old garden of Eden? [whooping] [birds chirping] Ahoy. Dinner is served at the captain's table. I'll bring your dinner here, Doris. Crackers. Huh, I guess the captain's table ain't so popular. We've gone to the trouble to make this table, why not use it? Doesn't it occur to you that Ms. Evans would rather not eat with you? Here we are. Ms. Evans, we might as well face the fact that the four of us have been thrown together here in the jungle. - Let's make the best of it. - I've thought that-- Now, just a minute, Doris. The wreck hasn't changed anything. Oh, yes, it has, Franklin. There's only one law here. No cops, no jails. That's the law of the jungle. Say, while you guys are arguing here our dinner is getting cold. Come on, Ms. Evans, let's you and I go while they're doin' the chinny. You're right...why go around with chips on our shoulders when the important thing is to exist until we can get out of here. My, Doris-- You know, that gives me a great idea. Let's pretend that we've just met for the first time. There's no past. Just a future. Let's bury the hatchet. Good. - Now.. - Come on, John. Hocus pocus. Abras-kadabras. Hepluras basueunis. Keep bad spirits, gone. You know, after all this food is not doing a bit of good-- Well, let me warm it up. I was thinking that will be a good idea. [whooping] You know, you can't run around the jungle with.. ...this on. I have a surprise for you. Look at that. Oh. And them, or these, or this. Oh, thank you. You know, I'm in this too. Well, help yourself. [monkeys whooping] Don't be annoyed, Franklin. They don't know who you are. I thought we buried all that. And you're the first one to break your resolution. That's right. Anyone who breaks a resolution must pay a forfeit. What will it be? Wash the dishes. You would think of that. Okay, Africa! But as long as I'm stuck first I'm gonna keep score on the rest of you guys. We're going to force our way through that swamp and see if we can find a way out of here. Well, I'm not really interested but if that'll help get you out of my life, let's go. Not a chance, Gordon. We can't get across. There's nothing but swamps on all sides. It's too risky. What's the matter, Franklin? Afraid to arm your prisoner? I'm not taking a chance of being stuck in a back by a mug with your reputation. Yeah. Newspaper reputation. Say, if I ever do started on you, I'll take you apart with my bare hands. That's a promise. Well, you can always try. Gentlemen. Or am I mistaken? Say, why not let's try the boat this time? Nothing doing. I've floated around that leaky scow all I'm going to. Come on, let's get going. We'll all stick together this time. Wait a minute. I don't like the idea of leaving Doris alone. Ms. Evans to you. And I'm not interested in what you think. That's for me to worry about. [birds chirping] [whistles] [growls] [growls] [whistles] [roars] [whistles] [growls] [whooping] [roars] [roars] What's that? Look out. Boy, what a mean-looking mama. Franklin, you should have left that gun with Ms. Evans. I'm the best judge of that. The important thing is to find a way out of here. Come on. Eddie, you better go along with the boy scout and see that he doesn't get lost. Get lost? Gee, that would be too bad, wouldn't it? [water gurgling] [whistling] [birds chirping] [monkeys screeching] [bird screeching] [water gurgling] [roars] [roars] [Doris screams] [roaring] [grunts] [roaring] [sighs] [monkeys chattering] No, don't do that. You'll get the wound infected. Come on back to camp and I'll dress them. Come on. That's fine. Thank you very much. Well, it's better to scratch on my arm than yours. It might have been your life...or mine. Strange, isn't it? How a human being will sometimes give willingly the very thing he'd fight to keep if it were demanded of him. I hope you've learned to stay out of the jungle while we're gone. I've learned a lot of things since we came to the jungle. [monkeys whooping] Not a chance, Gordon. We can't get across. There's nothin' but swamps on all sides. It's too risky. The next time I tell you to trail with us you trail with us. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. How long have you been here? Not very long. Hey, Gordon, what's the matter with your arm? Oh, I scratched at it, that's all. What happened? Your a big news hound, find out. [chuckling] You'll cook tonight, you better run down and see if your lady turtles laid any more egg. Yeah, that stupid things. Why don't they build nests so we wouldn't have to be diggin' up the whole beach? I'm goin' down to work on the boat, come on. Hey, Gordon, why don't you tell Doris your side of the whole story? Listen, Eddie, that girl loves her brother more than anything in the world. I'm certainly not gonna make it tougher for her by.. Oh, come on. Oh, hello, John. Everything alright, darling? Oh, of course. How long has Wayne been back? Ooh, I don't know, just a little while I guess. - Did you find anything? - Nothing. What happened to Wayne? Uh, I don't know. What do you mean? You know what I mean. His arm is bound up. He had a fight with an animal, I believe. You believe? You know. You bound his arm up, he couldn't have done it himself. Alright, if you must know he saved my life. [birds chirping] What are they? Albatrosses, this is their mating season. [birds chirping] [chuckling] He's trying to teach her the Albatross Kazatsky. [whistling] I'll be seein' you. The chef is gotta be getting back. [guitar music] [humming] Well, that's that. Say, I bet you I've got an old one you've never seen. Pick a card. - If you say that to me again-- - Alright. [music continues] Looks like nobody wants to play with us. Will you stop that scrumming? It's terrible. Oh, sounds like someone's out of tunes. Oh, I've got it. Sound away, maestro. [humming] That's clear enough. What could be worse than to be stranded with a couple of bum entertainers? [chuckles] A quartet. Well, I guess, I'll have to do my strumming somewhere else. [continues strumming] Hey, Gordon, I hope you don't meet a lion with, uh.. Franklin's idea of music. [chuckling] [music continues] (John)Doris, I want to talk to you. Alright, come in. I guess my company wasn't good enough for you. Why, John? Well, you left right after Wayne did. I don't know what's happened to you, Doris. One month in the jungle, and look what it's done to you. It's done things to all of us, hasn't it, John? Well, at least I've kept my self respect. I don't understand you. You know what I mean. Accepting the friendship of a man like Wayne. Well, what would you expect me to do? I think Gordon has acted admirably. Gordon? Oh, so that's how it is now? Yes, that's how it is. And you're right, the jungle has done things to me. Before we came here, I thought he was a beast. And now I suppose he's sprouted wings. No, but he has proven himself to be a man. I didn't follow you half way around the world to rot on this deserted coast. I wish I'd never heard of Gordon Wayne. You didn't go after Gordon Wayne because you loved me but to get a newspaper story. Well, I hope you get it. As I'm going to accept him for what he is. Alright, be the friend of a murderer if you like. But I'm going to take him back to the electric chair if I die in the attempt. Hey, Franklin. You know, uh, you owe me 62.50 now. Would you, uh, like to get even? Well, alright. Get out of here. Say, Franklin, don't you think, uh.. you're a little tough on your, uh, relatives?

I've been wanting to talk to you, alone. I wanted to tell you something. It's sort of a secret. Eddie and I've been working on the boat. I think we better almost sail with it. Does that mean we can get away from here? Just as soon as I finish the mast and we can make it sail all the way to Farlin. But what about these sudden storms? That's the chance we must take. A chance you must take. If you care to. You mean, you're not coming with us? I might try it alone. If I made it, send someone back to rescue you. What if you could never make it alone? Could you? [instrumental music] I might. When you get ready, why don't you try? It's your only chance. John would never let you get away if he knew. And how about you? Will you let me go? [music continues] When you go back you can chalk up a 1000 violations against me. I've fallen in love. Doggone, I've worn the spots off of these cards and no luck. We've had plenty of bad luck. I don't think we're ever going to get away from here. Oh, stop it. I'm sorry, Ms. Doris. But what's happened to you lately? Oh, I don't know. I guess, we're just getting on each other's nerves. Well, stop squawking. We're all on the same boat. Cut the cards, and-and I'll tell your fortune. Oh, as I live and breathe, a marriage. That means we've got to be rescued first. And if, uh, that takes care of you and Franklin of course we're going to be...rescued. What do I see here? Now, perhaps, I shouldn't mention it. Children. Don't be a fool. Look, look what I found. Isn't he a nice little fellow? [screeching] Here, take it. Hurray! You see? The first child. I tell you, the cards don't lie. You listen to me. Now, do you think you're making it easier on Doris by keeping your mouth shut, but I don't. Meaning what? Well, you and I have been pals for years, haven't we? Well, you leave it to me to fix this whole thing up. I'm gonna tell her the truth about her brother. I told you 20 times to keep your mouth shut and that means shut. Well, I'm gonna tell her just the same. Ms. Doris-- Oh, gee, Eddie.. I'm just a heel. I don't think so. And you won't tell Doris, will you? Okay, Africa. Say, there's some wreckage floating a couple of miles offshore. Maybe it's a part of our boat that didn't sink. Any signs of life? Yes, I thought I saw someone moving. Okay, we might be able to launch the lifeboat in high tide and get out through it. The boat? How can we use it? Well, we fixed the leak. And Gordon made a mast. Oh, getting ready to try a sneak, were you? Wrong again. You know, Franklin, as a newspaper man you've batted exactly zero since we came here. Now listen to me-- And the main thing is are we gonna try to get out on the derelict or not? Now come on, let's check up on our boat. Let's see if it's alright. Ahoy, there! (Eddie) There's a light, Frank, there's somebody here. (Frank) Surely, there must be. Come on up there. Come on with me, get up there and see if we can find it. Well, here we are. Out here. Here he is. Gee, you still got your men, Mr. Franklin. Where is Captain Anderson? I.. What is left of him. What happened, captain? We struck a reef in the morning. There wasn't even a lifeboat inside. And what was left of my ship was fast on the rock. Later, a storm broke me loose. I've been drifting, in the currents. Didn't you see any other ship? I saw smoke on the horizon several times. We were off our coast when we struck. Well, couldn't you get ashore? No, my ribs are broken. My leg is badly injured and it's too late now. Captain, is it still possible for you to marry people? Yeah. That is maritime law. As long as I have my ship under me I am his master. Will you do it then? Yeah, I will. Get me my log book, please in my chest. Gordon, will you marry me? Doris, are you crazy? No, perfectly sane and I've made my decision. Well, as long as he's in my charge, you'll never marry him. It's no use, I'm going to marry Gordon. Alright, Wayne. Remember this mockery doesn't change anything. We're ready, captain. I...bless you of the authority rested in me as master of this ship.. I pronounce you man and wife. What is today's date? I have lost track of time. I'll fill it in for you, captain. Thank you. I need your signature as a witness. Take this book. We can't leave him alone here to die. And this is no place for you, Doris. I'll take her back to camp and I'll come out for you. Yes, take me back, Eddie. Eddie, take this with her. Okay. Captain, is there something I can do for you? Yeah... my ancestors ...were Vikings. Their ships were their funeral fires. What I've got I should like to sail that way.. ...to Valhalla. Yeah. To Valhalla. [water gurgling] Well, what you going to do about all this? About all what? You start out to get a murderer and end up by marrying him. As soon as that boat's ready, I'm gonna take you outta here. Back to civilization, where you can come to your senses. As for Wayne, the law will take care of him. And there'll be no mockery about that. - Oh, Doris-- - Just a minute, Franklin. My wife's not a widow yet. No, but she will be if you start resisting an officer. There's plenty of time to talk about that later. You might as well make up your mind, Franklin. I'm not going back. Well, if that's your idea-- Folks, there is a boat, offshore. A boat? Just a minute, Wayne. We're back to the laws of civilization now. And I'm going to keep you in irons on this time. [gunshot] [grunting] Look. They must have seen the fire of the funeral ship. [grunting] But there's a ruckus. [gasps] [honking] [instrumental music] [music continues] Doris! I know all about it. You are innocent. How do you know? My brother tried to escape. And he was killed. Before he died, he told the truth. All the world knows it now. This ship returns in ten days. It's all honeymoon. [instrumental music]
