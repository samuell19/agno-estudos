Elif, take god care of yourself sweety. And say "hi" to them. Allright? Allright allright. You just come home anyway. -Which way? -To the main road. Can you give me a ride to the main road? The main road is the opposite direction! Can you drop me off and then go back on your way? On one condition, if you put that off! Buckle up. The heat is heavy and that irritates really. That's too tight too. My name is Leyal. What's yours? Ali... Your name's been nice. Is it Kurdish? -Arabic. -What does it mean? It means a very long night... Aren't you afraid? Alone, on your own like this... My dad had a traffic accident. I gotta catch up. I hope he gets well soon. Is it serious? Thanks, yeah, that's what they say. When did you learn? They called me a couple hours ago. You should have already been on a bus now. Why did you wait? No bus. A minibus once a day, at the crack of dawn. Isn't there even a taxi in your hometown? I'll get off if the interrogation is gonna continue! All right, all right. I'll give you a ride. Where are you going? You don't look like you are from around here? Just going... Howcome just going? Just going as I please. Are you from that town? No. But we've been here for ten years. Who are you going to visit? Noone. They praised your town's music and dance a lot... I just wanted to stop by. God gracious. Are we that famous? That's what they said, honestly. -Do you know Arabic? -I do. What do you do for living? Nothing. I don't do anything. Howcome nothing? I am sure you have a job. It's like you are an artist? Kind of. I got it, right away! -How? -From your tattoos... Nowadays, everyone has it. But it shows that you are an artist. -I am, in fact, a guitarist. -How so? What do you mena how so? I just play the guitar. Do you have a band or something? I had one until yesterday... ...but not anymore! Why? I got bored. Leyal. Leyal? Let's give a bathroom break! Aren't you gonna get off? No, thanks. I'll wait here. Got it. -Take it. -Thanks. Anything to drink? We will be here for about fifteen to twenty minutes more. Know this! What? Right on time! I'm not luck. If I was... Let's stop a passing-by car if you want! You would go faster. Where are you going? Leyal, where are you going? No, it is not about being sick. I just ran off home. I knew something like that would happpen. What will you do now? I don't know. I don't think I will find such strength later on. Bravo. What did I get involved in? You idiot. -Where are you going? -I will just wait here. Don't worry. They will not do anything to you. I will pretend I believe. I just don't understand why you are running off? A lot of trouble. I don't want him! I don't even want to see his face. Go get a job. I don't know. Build a life for yourself. It's not that easy around here, what you're saying. The next song will be my luck! Just a little window Do not touch the fig tree Just a little window Do not touch the fig tree If my tyrant father hears He will chain you there You just killed me Yes, you just killed me You just destroyed me Yes, you just killed me. You have a beautiful voice. Do you know any Arabic songs? Sure I do. We still speak Arabic at home. Come on, sing one. Why? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna make an album? -Do you want it? -Maybe. Tough job, very tough. Especially they'll eat someone immature like you alive! Then, what are you gonna do? I would like to record it, if you don't mind. I'll listen to it when I want. My grandmother raised me. Me and my sister. She said if you search for it... ... you can find the song of immortality. -Does it exist? -I don't know. Night falls and you see the dark. So you mean, you are looking for that song now? And you drift away in your deep love. Kind of. Oh my bride, my loving bride, you have killed me. So you're saying the song that I'll sing is that song. I'll make my grandmother listen to it. Perhaps she knows? You have left me and went away. I'll sing, but with one condition! And that is? If you give me a ride to the city. We did already deal with you! I'll take you to the main road. Isn't your agony my demise? I can't take the bus, don't you understand? They know everything, how many bus on this road and their timetables. Oh my bride, oh loving bride, you have killed me.

Now that I see you eating with appetite... This seems like a diner but it has people coming here regularly... ...since it has the best food in the town. I guess my instincts proved right after all. I intended to stop at the two previous restaurants... ...but I didn't for some reason. Then I saw this place. I said, ok, I will eat something here. Where are you headed? Long journey! Actually I am looking for a family from around here. They have a daughter, Leyal. Do you know them? Leyal? She ran off at the wedding night. Wedding night? Did you know her? Allright, thanks. I can't say I knew her, I just met her. Did you know her? She is a little stubborn. Recently they wanted to marry her. The guy is old but a good one. She didn't want the engagement ceremony... ...then she didn't say anything at the wedding night. Then, she disappeared with all the gold at the wedding night. She planned all that, they say. What do you have to do with them? I don't have anything to do. Just some news to the family. About the girl? Kind of. My mom and dad used to come here for vacation every summer. They used to live in Germany back then. About ten years or so. My grandma looked after us; me and my sister. She raised us. Whatever... It was one of those visit that my father brought a mandolin for me. My passion for guitar started back then. I just want to play it every moment. One day, I was playing my grandma came and said something... She told me: "If you totally give your soul to music... ...one day you will get to hear the voice of the God... ...in a song and thus shall become immortal". Grandma spoke big words. If you just knew her... I moved all the cassettes that I had downstairs. You know we used to have casettes back then. Not like today. I used to listen to casettes and rewind them and listen again. One day she was laughing at me and then came close. She said, "Ali. It's not that easy! Perhaps you have to travel around the whole world... ...if you want to hear that voice". So what I did? I played the songs that are on everyone's lips... ...and I listened to those songs like everybody else at those... ...damn bars until the mornings, though. Ok, I ll have to excuse myself. Their house is behind that building. Thanks brother. Thank you, may you live long for letting us know! You did your human duty. She used to have the passion since childhood. She was determined that she was going to be a singer. Then her uncle intervened. We said it is allright then, let her do it. Then at the end of the day she screwed up for good. Thanks. Well, she didn't tell me these. Oh, what a fox she is. Wouldn't I know my daughter. We didn't want her to disgrace herself and wanted to marry her. She screwed that up too and ran off. If I were you I would apply the district prosecutor. I just told what I knew as the precinct. You would know better. May she just die. Just let her die. How many times. I locked her up at home. I sent her to her uncle. Her uncle took her to Germany. Just didn't work out. I suffered all her pain, all the longing. Just didn't work out, didn't work out, didn't work out. It is all empty, empty, empty. It didn't work out, didn't work out. Didn't work out... My daughter just didn't work out. She stepped on her mother's heart... Shut up, you g{ve me headache! We couldn't know, everything is possible. She is out my authority now, she all up to her husband. I sent the news for her husband as well. And told him that if he ever finds her... ...he could take all the gold even the ones that we gave her. Just spares her life. I can't even walk for the last three months. I just got stuck here. What else can I do? -Young man. -Yes. I think she went to her brother. They live in village. He and his wife are singer. Thanks. Sorry! I had to talk like that next to my husband. He really is angry. He can't walk for a long time. He got extremely stubborn. He blames me for she ran off. I just tune up with him... I understand. -So what is her brother's name? -Sezai. His wife's is Bird Zehra. Everyone knows her if you just ask. -Thanks a lot. -Thanks. Hello? Leyal, it that you? Hello? Leyal! -Good luck with that. -Thank you brother! I was going to the village and I think I just got lost. You will turn left ahead. What is it? Who are you looking for? I am looking for Sezai. You know, he plays saz. I see, it is our crazy Sezai then. Just go straight then take right. -I will go straight then right huh? -Yes. Turn right. -Thanks. -Say "hi" from Sad{k. Of course. Good luck! Thank you. I guess I am interrupting? Come on in, come on. Sad{k directed me, he said "hi". Allright. My name is Ali. I'm a musician. Sad{k told me you are also a musician. Not really, I haven't played it for a long time. Why? I can't explain it in haste! If you'd like to stay over, we have both food and a bed for you! I don't wanna disturb you. You're waiting for insistence. But that, I don't have. I say it for once and say it from the heart. It's your choice... Okay then. -I would drink that tea. -Let it brew a little. It is cooler inside. Come on in. Zehra! Look, we have a guest! Hello ma'am. She is mute. She had meningitis when she was a child. She hears, but doesn't speak. Look at that one. Take that, take that. It pisses everywhere. I brought salute from your sister. You know her? Dude... Actually I'm looking for Leyal. You, too? -Did others ask about her, too? -Her husband stopped by before you. -Her second husband. -How so? Did she also have another husband? She eloped from her first husband five years ago. And she also left the second husband and took the bridal... ...jewelery and ran away on their wedding night two days ago. She just ran off with my car. -So, you're after the car, then! -No, I found the car. There is no problem with that. But, how can I say... She has an incredible voice. Do you want to make a record? No. Not like that! Here is the deal... When I found the car, it was almost drenched in blood. The bag was opened and everything was everywhere. The gold was taken. I am just worried something might have happened to her. She must be afraid now. Leyal doesn't even know how to be afraid. Look man! My niece is beautiful and cute. But, she never brought luck to guys who tagged along after her. How come? Because she is, in a sense, similar to me. If she has something in her mind, then alright! She wouldn't care a bit even if the whole world stood against her. When my sister ran away from her first husband... ...he got under a lorry and died when he took off after her. Let's see what happens to this second poor guy now? Well, when I saw the car I thought it is not a job for a poor guy. Anyway... She doesn't come to me. She knows we're much alike. That's why she doesn't come. She is running away from herself, what should she do with me. Hey Zehra? Where are you? We have a guest here. Thanks ma'am. Wow, you got a lot of instruments here huh? Most of them belong to Zehra. Her father is a dengbej. You're kidding? Zehra. Our guest... I told him you play saz but he doesn't believe it! He doesn't believe that your father is dengbej either. Oh no, no. It's not that. "Why did you tell peoeple what do i do." she said. I am telling you to keep that away. Most belonged to me. But one day I got crazy. All of them looked like rubbish to me. -Then, I threw them all out. -Uh, dude! Then she brought these back together and saved them. Now, you see, we make a living out of her music, she looks after us. Why doesn't she play something for us? Look he is asking you to play. She says it's impolite. She says let him eat. Uh, it doesn't matter. I am ok without eating. You just play. I dove into lakes Like the green goose I dove into lakes Like the green goose You just made a Folk story out of me I would just go to Foreign places now Netiher you forget me Nor do I forget you Netiher you forget me Nor do I forget you -What's up Murat? -Forget about me. You've got the news? When is the return back? What's the matter? Dear brother, the man softened up indeed and lowered the costs. We would be ok for 20 grand now. So that is what you call super? Bro we'll have an album released, what else do you expect? Look Murat, dude, I don't believe either in that album... ...neither in those people. This is an off-deal for me. Do whatever you want! Howcome? Which way we will go dude? Let's go straight. She wants to tell you something. She says, Leyal might have gone toher other uncle. I mean, my brother. He owns a nightclub. Its name is Güldeste. Everyone knows it! If you see Leyal, say "hi" for me and tell her... ...that I love her so much! And she says hug her for me. Allright. Take care dude. Hey blonde! Do some solo drum tonight that people might just get in groove. -I do my best. -What do you mean your best? You don't do that for years. -Huh, Batu? -He will not do that brother. I don't know why he do it like this. Ali. Ali? What the hell are you looking at? It's me, Tolga, dude. Tolga have changed o lot brother. How could I know? What change? Its the very same material dude. Meet the guys; Blonde, Batu and Ali. Ali, nice to meet you. -Ali is a great gutarist. -Come on. He is just the best around here. So what are you planning to do? Just to mak some shadow? Come on, grab a chair. Oh, God. Ok. He plays the guitar that he breaks the string of the thing. -Say it dude. -What? Ok. What are you doing here? I am cool, just hanging out. We arrived two days ago. -I'm with Zeze. -What do you mean. Is he here? -He's sleeping in his room. -How is he? It is the same old Zeze, you know him. He is closing down each passing day. We can go up to his room if you want. Yeah, that would be great. I want to see him. It will be great, yeah. We will. Look, our guitarist will leave, anyway. Hang out with us. We will visit the master, yeah, but he may be sleeping dudes. It's allright. He will be waking up to a day with four clean faces, today. Zeze? Zeze? Come, come. Good morning Dude. How much money do we have? Five hundred dude, maybe. How are the sales? Not bad, I guess. The owner of the place said it's allright. So I guess it is good. This hot weather stresses me off Look. Ali came. our guitarist. You know, the one we listened to before together. -So how's everything Ali? -Thanks. This hot weather is beyond bearable now. I wanna go to the the North pole! Yeah, you see, it's the same old Zeze, never changes. -Let's go. -Huh? Let's just go! He got really old. Bro, didn't you advertise or anything? Didn't I? Sure, I did. We arranged two radio programs and the local newspapers. Howcome? We have been going around. We didn't see a billboard or anything. There are people who don't listen to those radio programs... ...or read those newspapers, for sure. I mean, no small posters on the rear window of the buses. I didn't understand it. I mean you talk as if Madonna came. What's the product, then the worth of the advertisement is also that. Oh, you're unbelievable! I mean, of course, we're not Madonna. But we're also not bad at all, bro. We also have a reputation of our own, you know. I don't trust you but is your PR guy also immature, I don't know? Well, it's up to luck now. We've done everything that can be done for such a band. We'll also start it half an hour late. There is nothing else to be done! Would that be the last thing possible? Oh, yes! A cow! As if he is marketing tomatoes. A stupid wholesaler. Whatever, just screw it. Our guys are rehearsing upstairs. Let's play some. Tolga, I'm gonna go. What happened? Did someone do something? No, bro. I have bussines to do. Let me! We would hang out bro. You have just boasted around And never have come around You have just boasted around And never have come around You couldn't have got married now feel for it I enjoy it Yeah, I just enjoy it You couldn't have got married now feel for it I enjoy it Yeah, I just enjoy it The pear had stem The grape had stem The pear had stem The grape had stem You ate the quince at the end of tha day I enjoy it Yeah, I just enjoy it You ate the quince... Bring, what everone have. Thanks. Welcome, welcome. Hey, dude. Can I ask for a song? Would you know it? -What's it? -Cimali Vali. His name is Cimali Vali His name is Cimali Vali What is my voice compared to hers! I hadn't gone to my sister's, so I said let me just go to her. I did. Then I heard a beautiful voice. Then I asked her, "Who is she?" She said, "Don't you know her?" I said, "How could I know? She said, "She is your cousin, Leyal." My God, is that the girl who used to go up to rooftop and sing there. She said, "Yes, yes, she is." Hatice, Can you bring us two coffees please? I brought her here. I trained her. I taught her how to use her voice. The tricks of the throat. The depth of the lungs. I trained her and we went to Europe together. We went from one concert to another. Oh, God. We made whole lot of money. Marks and dollars full of bags. They did not have euros back then. Then what did she do to me? She just kicked me in the back. Give it to the guest first. Thank you ma'am. Bon appetit. -Thank you. -Bon appetit. She tought she became a star, she got spoiled. She then made out with the driver. I warned her; look this is good, that is not. She, of course didn't listen. She followed the driver. The driver? Is he the one who died in traffic accident following her? -Yes, Yes! -Sorry. After he passed away, girl started running in the first ranks again. Where do you think she has gone? She doesn't have the courage to come to me. She knows I'll just shut the door in her face. I heard about her last move. She has got married just to leave the groom at the wedding night. She took the gold ans simply took off. I found my car but there was blood all around the car. I am just worried something might have happened to her. What the hell have you got to do with that? She has a mother and a father. What is that to you? I don't get that. Yeah, whatever, let me roll. Thanks anyway. You could have stayed here tonight. Thank you, thank you for the coffee too. -Bon appetit. -Yeah, thank you. Hey, young man. Can you come here? Don't you believe him! He is a cruel man. He separated the little girl from her mother at an early age. He made her sing to the drunk and made money on her. You say so? When the girl fell for the driver, he tortured her. He locked her in, he threatened to kill her. But the guy he eloped with was already married. He later gave himself away. Howcome? That is a separate matter. She came here. She implored mercy. She begged him. But, he didn't care. He made a fool of her. He is spiteful, really spiteful. So, the girl just left everything behind and went away. So where did she go? She said, she wanted to go to Istanbul. Her husband's family went after her. They even caught herbut she ran away from them with difficulty. In all modesty... ...I had little money and I felt for her so I gave it to her. What a pity for such a beautiful girl. She neither has the beauty nor the aura anymore. Yeah, I see. Thank you. -Have an easy work. -Thanks. -Hello, Murat? -Oh. Bro. So you remembered? Look I'm gonna tell you something. Keep your ear to the ground for the folk song bars. Check whether you can find someone called Leyal going to any of those. Huh. Ooh, I get it. Murat, cut it out now. I'm on my way back. Ok. Ok. So who the hell is Leyal? She is about 28 years old. She has black hair... ...and big eyes. A fairly beautiful girl. Alright, I'll check it! Thanks. I am not going to make it sweetheart, I am just returning. But you have to come. We need you down here.

Ow, auntie, how is the situat{on with gardens? Granpa's gardens? Almost ruins now. Baran, should we just take a hike up there? Allright brother Ali, I am in. You didn't know Granddad Dilo, did you? No, I didn't Ali. But I've heard his name... Actually, you know what, I also remember him vaguely. Grandpa just took off from here and went all the way to... Come on, sit down. Back then there was no car or train. So he went to the town first and met a group of Armenian. Together then, they went to Mediterranean on foot, horseback. Then al the way to America. He stayed there for a long time and then returned here of course. He brought two things back. One was a pot of gold and the other were these rose plants. Dad sold everything around here just to be able to go to Germany. When I was a child I used to come here whenever I felt bored. I would just put my head down by the side of rose plants... ...and sleep while sniffing them. Grandma then used to look for me; "Ali, Ali!" And when she got angry she used to call me Alo. I think she was afraid that I would leave, just like my father. Then again she used to tell me do things on my own. Go do this, do that, get your share from life. And now, Elif is going. Brother Ali, should we stay here tonight. You song with your guitar, huh? Good idea little one. Bravo. Let's just see the grandma off with songs. Allr{ght go get the guitar from the car. A very beautiful song. Who made it? A friend of mine. Is he an artist like you? She, takes on all the world to sing if necessary. So she is not much like me. Now I feel like we lived this very moment before. Yeah, I feel the same way. Huh, interesting. Brother Ali, they have come. Baran stand up, the water of the dam rose. Up! God damn it. God damn it. The shoes are gone. I knew it would be like that. Baran, go, take the guitar to the car. Damn it. Baran, you move on, I will find a pair of shoes for myself. -Welcome Mother. -Hi. What is all that mess? Will you come like that? What is wrong with me? Pull yourself togethe a little, son. Don't do that mom, not today. As if I really said something. The message has just came. They gave the visa. So you're going? Go and also for me, see the city where granddad worked! I mean, the Ford factory and all... It's a bit far away from me! Forget it. Perhaps one day I'll come. Oh people, how did you know the deceased? We knew her well, a nice person. -Do you all give blessings to her? -We do. -Do you all give blessings to her? -We do. -Do you all give blessings to her? -We do. God bless you all, recite your Fatihah for her.. Hello? Hello? Leyal? Leyal, is that you? Is that you? -Were you sleeping? -No, I was just having breakfast. -Got news for you. -What is it?
