I believe in the playground. It's my favoritest place in the whole wild world. But two yesterdays ago, a bad thing happened when we was playing there. Some big boys took my brother's binky and buried it in the sandbox. Binky bye-bye. - They maked my brother cry. - [whimpers] So I said, "Dilly, this is a job for the Bobfather." [gulps] You come to me on the day of this wedding and ask me to take care of the boys who made your brother cry? Um, no. Uh, Dil just wants a new binky. That's it? A binky? I don't get to squeeze no one's head or pull no one's hair? - Uh, no. - Binky, please. Dumb baby. Can't even make a good wish. All right. Kiss my ring. - [laughing, slobbering] - Ew! Go send the next one in, and tell him to bring a sponge. ["That's the way (I like it)" playing] ♪ That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh ♪ Nine, 11, uh, 20... Chuckie!

What sweet children. Is this your first time in Paris? Well, France, yes. But, you see, I've been to Paris, Texas, a number of times. Wow! [electricity crackling] [both gasp] Reptar's head! I wonder if the Bobfather had anything to do with this. Come on, Chuckie! It's a wadey pool! [gasps] Whee! [chuckles] [laughing] - Ooh. They look hungry. - Must be lunchtime. - [indistinct conversation] - Huh? ...just leave no fingerprints. [screams] Where did those filthy little bookends come from?

Come along, children. Um, madame, Mr. Pickles is here. Oh, good. Send in the clown. So, if it isn't the brilliant designer. Well, I wouldn't say brilliant. - Neither would . - [gasps] Why don't we take the babies to see the princess parade while they get better acquainted? Oh, the kids would love that. See this face? I never want to make this face again! - [gasps] - Now get to work. I'll have it working in no time. Mechanical expertise is my middle name. Then your first name should be "I have no." Sorry to interrupt your episode, but it's the boss on the phone. [laughs] Oh, Monsieur Yamaguchi, SO nice to see you. As you know, I'm stepping down as president of Yamaguchi Industries, and I've begun a search for my replacement. Splendid. I accept. You are one of the many under consideration. But I have made millions for this company! The candidate should not be concerned only with money. They must understand what it means to bring joy to children. In fact, they themselves must have the heart of a child. I must have one in a jar somewhere. In fact, I'm engaged to a wonderful man with a baby thing all his own. Oh! Congratulations, madame. I look forward to attending the wedding and seeing you with your new family. We'll discuss the promotion then. Goodbye. What now, Pinocchio? Years of clawing my way to the top, gone to waste. Why am I not some child's tender mother? - [pounding table] - Why? Why? Why? [sobbing] [Jean-Claude] Because you hate children, and men find you to be a heartless shrew? There has to be a spineless little man with a brat of his own somewhere out there. Bonjour? [gasps] My chocolates are in her little American stomach! Jean-Claude! Get them back! - Open wide. Say "aah." - No, wait! You have five seconds to come up with a reason why I should not lock you up forever and ever. Um... because I can stick five raisins up my nose, and I can sing real good, and forever and ever is a long time! Ticktock. And I know where you can find a spiny little man with a brat of his own? I think... [chuckles] ...I just made a friend. - [people cheering] - [upbeat music playing] [Tommy] Wow! Isn't this neat, Chuckie? I don't know. There's something kind of weird about a guy in a ponytail and a dress. Golly, Kira, you're a natural. [giggles] Well, I have a beautiful little girl to thank for that. Kimi. She's almost two. So's my Chuckie! I mean, not a girl, I mean, but... well, you know... Oh, look! The princess is coming. Once upon a time, there was a mighty dinosaur named Reptar. [gasps] Everyone ran away from him except the beautiful princess. She was not afraid, because she could see that Reptar was not vicious. He was lonely and unhappy. So she promised to take care of him and keep him safe and loved forever and ever. Forever and ever... My mommy says Mr. Chuckie's dad is so desperate that he'll marry the first lady that plops the question. Excellent! Now, run along before you give me lice. Hey! What do I get out of this deal? Ha! Why should I give you anything? Gee, I don't know. 'Cause I could accidentally tell someone why you want to marry Mr. Chuckie's dad? An extra scoop for cunning. Tell Auntie Coco what you desire. Let's see. Not much. Just my own float in the Reptarland parade, with matching ponies and my own fashion show and to be the flower girl at your wedding. Ha! And who said Americans are greedy? I will take care of it, Angelique. Jean-Claude, find out where our guests are dining tonight. Love is on the menu. [pop music playing] This place gots the biggest babies I ever sawed. [Phil] That's gotta be one stinky diapie. When I came to France, I had dreams of bouillabaisse, crêpe Suzette, chicken cordon bleu... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I had dreams of eating with a fork.

[grunts, mumbles] - [Coco gasps] Stuart? - [gasps] What a surprise! Everyone, this is Madame LaBouche. Uh-uh-uh. Mademoiselle. [gasps] And who is this devastatingly handsome red-haired man you are trying to hide from me? [stammering] That's my good friend, Chas Finster. - [Didi exclaims] - Enchantée. Bonsoir, mademoiselle. Oh, call me Coco. And that adorable misproportioned ragamuffin must be your son. Madame LaBouche! Madame LaBouche! - Oh, hi, Kira. - What? I'm sorry to interrupt, madame, but these need your signature. - Can you join us for dinner? - Why, I-- Oh, you're much too busy, Kira! Oh, that's too bad. [Kimi laughing] Oh! That must be Kimi! - Who? - My daughter. Oh. Of course. So, Kimi, do you and your mommy and daddy live in Reptarland? Not exactly. It's just me and my mommy, and we live in Paris. But I gets to come here all the time. Kimi, you met the princess? Sure. Lots of times. She lives out there, in that castle on that bowlcano and comes out between 'splosions. [Tommy] Now we know where to find your new princess mom, Chuckie. Chuckie? Sorry. I stopped listening after "'splosions." Hey, do you think Kimi would like to come to the park with me and the kids tomorrow? Oh, what a coincidence! I planned to spend the day with her there myself. - But, madame! You never-- - Tire of taking care of your daughter. So, it's a date. It'll just be you and me and that adorable swarm of infants. [sniffing] [barking] -[people chattering] -[calliope playing] Wow! Robosnail! I think I'm in love. Hi, Robie. Why didn't you people just follow my design? I used paper clips and rubber bands for a reason! I love their fries and everything, but this is advanced robotics. It looks pretty complicated. Actually, it's not. You just put on the gear, and anything you do, Reptar does. [mechanical whirring] It's so simple, a child could work it. Right, champ? Huh? Oh, no, no! [screaming] [exclaiming] [gasps] Sorry! [exclaims, screams] Did I say child? I meant young adult. - Bonjour, everyone. - [Kimi grunts] Ready to go, mon chéri? Let me just get Dilly settled. And how is this precious gherkin today? - [exclaims] - [grunts] Why, you're just a lawsuit waiting to happen, aren't you? Mon chéri, I could listen to your fascinating health history all day. Then I'll tell you all about my poor sinus drainage when I get back from the little boys' room. Would you mind holding Dil? Uh-- Of course not. This should be good. So, we meet again. How delightful. [Dil squeals, laughs] Kira! They're staring at me, and this child is leaking from the mouth. What do I do? Just smile and be nice. Hello! You are not horrible. - [squeals, laughs] - No! Let go! Do you know how much I paid for these lips? I don't think Dil likes that lady too much, you guys. Stop it, you dripping urchin! I don't think she likes Dil too much either. She's not a very nice lady. She's too pointy. Kira, he's crying. What do I do now? Comfort him. Gently bounce him up and down. [gasps] [groans] Ah. According to Lipschitz, Dilly just gave you a gift. Why wouldn't he? After all, children, they are my life! Oh! I have that poem taped to the refrigerator! - Pardon? - [Kira] "Children Are My Life." It is a classic! "Dappled laughter, patting feet." "Joy and wonder, heaven's treat.” It is one of my favorites! "Joy and wonder, heaven's treat.” It's one of my favorites. Wow! [children exclaiming] Oh, dear. They're getting fussy.

Maybe this thing is too tight. Do you see those sticky fingers? Jam-covered mouths? Dirty little faces? Disinfect them! Ah! What are you doing with that mangy thing? Give me that! [both grunting] How dare you defy me! You babies are in trouble now. [seethes] You are going to be mine, you will do things my way! [screams] [gasps] Jean-Claude, take those wretched dust mops away! I will not have them ruining my wedding day! Looks like you dumb babies will be missing the wedding. And don't forget the big mouth too. My pleasure, madame. - Keep your hands off me, you big bully! - [gasps] What do you think you're doing? I'm the flower girl! I feel your pain, mademoiselle. Unfortunately, you just got the boot. But what about my float and the matching ponies? - Madame LaBouche! - Burn this hideous, moth-eaten plaything. I never want to see it again. Oh... [Coco] To Notre-Dame, and move it. Madame LaBouche, you cannot go through with this. It's obvious you don't really love Chas or Chuckie. - Which is which again? - [sighs] I can no longer stand by and watch you destroy their lives. I'm going to tell Chas the truth! And there's not a thing you can do to stop me. - [tires screech] - [grunts] Except throw you out on the curb. Au revoir! [tires screech] Looks like our little mouse is up for the chase. Step on it. - [engine revs] - [bicycle bell rings] I'm sorry, guys. If I didn't want a princess mommy so bad, we wouldn't be in this terrible place. It's not so terrible. I mean, at least we gots Reptar to keep us company. Well, I decided I don't want a princess mommy no more. I don't need the magic and sparkly dust. Alls I wants is a real mommy like you guys gots. I want a mommy who smiles and talks nice to me and tucks me in at night and tells me stories. And... who loves me. Oh, come on, Finster. Don't cry. I can't help it, Angelica. I feel bad. My daddy's marrying a lady who doesn't like me or my Wawa or my friends. Actually, Finster, it's sort of my fault. What do you mean, Angelica? Well, let's see, where do I start? It's like this. Mr. Yummyhoochie was on TV, and he told the French lady you can't have joy if you don't got a heart. Well, she had one in a jar, but she still needed a spiny man with a kid. So I told her how you wanted a princess mom, and she was supposed to give me my own pony float, but she made the whole thing up! [seethes] I helped that lady trick your daddy into marrying her! [all gasp] You did? But... Bad yucky! Bad! Now, pipe down, drooly! Dilly's right! That's one of the worstest things you've ever done, Angelica! I know it was bad. Even for me. But sometimes I just can't help myself. I'm sorry, Chuckie. [gasps] You guys, I can't let that lady marry my daddy! It's like you always say, Tommy, "A baby's got to do what a baby's got to do." And we gots to stop that wedding! How are you gonna do that, Chuckie? Um, actually, I was hoping that you had an idea, Tommy. Hmm. [pipe organ playing] ♪ I love you truly ♪ - ♪ Truly, dear ♪ - Huh? [grunts] Oh, Betty! Finally we get to see an authentic Parisian landmark: Notre-Dame. Eh, you seen one church, you seen 'em all. Wake me if you spot a hunchback. Uh, I wonder where Jean-Claude is with the kids. I can't start without my little guy. What do you think you're doing? Oh, I'm just, um, practicing tying shoes. Children are so easily amused. - [roaring] - [gasps] Sacrebleu! Thank you for flying Air Angelica. [grunts] See, Chuckie? I told you we could do it. Yeah, if we could just find the door. [all screaming] Uh, there's one. Hey, ya dumb babies, wait for me! [screaming] - Tommy, we forgetted Angelica. - You say that like it's a bad thing. - Chuckie, we gots to go back. - I don't know if I can, Tommy! I barely know how to go forward. Wait for me! Do you know how hard it is to run in a flower girl dress? [panting] I'm opposed to be at that wedding! Take me to the church! - [screaming] - [Lil] Wow. Reptar's boogers look just like Angelica. Hold on, Angelica! [screaming] - Good catch, Chuckie! - [coughing] This is not the parade I wanted! ♪ I love you truly... ♪ Keep that Kira out until after the very last "I do"! ♪ Truly, dear... ♪ Goodness! Here comes the bride! Without the Wedding March? - Without the flower girl? - Without Chuckie? [singing continues] - Go, go, go! Start. - Coco, we can't start yet. - Chuckie's not here. - Darling, we will tell him all about it. But I want to share this moment with my son. - That is what videotape is for. - [grunts] Go ahead! Bonjour, everyone. I would like to welcome the family and friends of Monsieur and Madame... Yes, yes, yes. They can read that in the program. Let's begin! - [child] What you drawing, Kimi? - It's a green thumb. - [child 2] It's a pickle with legs. - [child 1] It's Reptar. - Right! - No, I mean, it's really Reptar! [panicked shouting] How do we get out of here? Um, I think it's that way. No, that way. Or that way. As long as you're sure. Hiya, Reptar! Wow! Kimi looks like a bug from here. Let's pick her up! Wow! I've never been on this ride before! [laughing] Whee! Hey, pip-squeak! Get your own float! [Jean-Claude] Going somewhere, my reptilian friend? - [gasps] - You babies cannot hide from Jean-Claude, Super-Escargot! [chuckling] [whispering] Would it be all right if I said a poem to my bride? Charles would like to recite a poem to his bride. It's our favorite, remember? [gasps] [laughing] [panting] [horn honks] I'll have you babies for lunch! But not without the proper sauce. You want a piece of me, sluggy? Move over, pip-squeak! I'll show you how it's done! - [laughing] - [horns honking] Stop wobbling, Chuckie! [exclaims] Don't tell me, tell my feet. Oh! My shell! Stop, in the name of France! [gasps] Look, Chuckie! I think they want us to stop. [Chuckie] So do ! [all exclaiming] Okay, then. Don't stop. - Mmm. Wha-- [gasps] - [screams] [siren wails] [Tommy, Chuckie gasping] [relieved sigh] - "Squeaky giggles, wiggly toes... - [phone ringing] ...teeny-tiny button nose. - Rosy lips and soft wet kisses..." - What? Oh! Madame, the babies are on their way to the church. What? You bumbling idiot! You disgust me! [nervous chuckle] Um, Auntie sends her love. Come on! Give it some gas! - [farts] - Ew. Dil! No 'fense, but could somebody maybe open a window? Okay. Hello, guys! 'Bout time you tinkleheads came to the rescue. Tag! You're it! [screaming] [Jean-Claude] ♪ Babies go round and round ♪ ♪ I'll launch them from the ground ♪ ♪ They will go flying now ♪ ♪ Their mommies have a cow... ♪ [all screaming] [alarm blaring] [all screaming] Look! Up in the sky! - It's a nerd! - It's a pain! It's... Angelica. What's the big idea? Are you pottyheads trying to get rid of me? That was the big idea. Can you see the church? There it is! [gasps] [screaming] [relieved sigh] [Kimi] Chuckie, you're my hero. [Chuckie stammering] Hang on, you guys. I think I got a wedgie. "Grasping fingers, dimpled chin, pudgy bellies, velvet skin." Enough poetry! Marry us now! [Tommy] Look, Chuckie, we're almost there! [Angelica] Yeah, there's the church. [Jean-Claude] Hello, my toddling tourists. This is where your tour of Paris comes to an end! Chuckie, we gots to beat Robosnail, or that mean lady's gonna be your new mommy! Over my dad's potty! En garde, babies! - [chortling] - [grunts] [grunting] [chortling] Out of my way, slug-face! Ha! Take that! And that! [exclaiming] [screaming] - [Tommy] You did it, Chuckie! - Yeah, I did! Now let's go save my daddy. For better or worse. Next! For richer or-- - Poorer! Sickness-- - And in health. Oh, must we repeat everything? [exclaiming] - [person] What is going on? - [person 2] I don't know. Oh, dear Lord, I skipped a section! [Tommy] Hurry, Chuckie! [grunting] - Hey! Look what I found. - Papie clips and bubber bands! [gasps] [screaming] I'm coming, Daddy! Go, Chuckie, go! - [Phil] Hurry! - [Lil] You can do it, Chuckie! [growling] [gasps] If anyone objects to this union, - speak now or forever hold your peace. - [gulps] [growling] [shuddering] I gots to be brave. I gots to be brave. No! Chuckie? [all gasping] He said his first word. He's talking! No! Chuckie! Chuckie! [sobbing] It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Daddy's here. Oh! And so is his new mommy. - Come here, little boy. - [gasps] No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Madame! [sobbing] Our kidnapping plot has failed! Ignore that unemployed fool. Coco, the wedding is off. You are not the woman I thought you were. [Angelica] Hey, lady. Looks like your plan to trick Mr. Yummy-sushi didn't work after all. Pretty flower girls should be seen, not heard. I would like to hear what the little one has to say. Okay, but listen good, 'cause I'm tired of telling this story. That cuckoo lady told her boss she had a kid's heart in a jar, and she was gonna marry Mr. Chuckie's daddy just so she could be president. - Listen, you traitor! - Now, Miss LaBouche. - [nervous chuckle] - You are dismissed. Dismissed? But no one fires Coco LaBouche. Coco LaBouche fires others! Coco LaBouche is EuroReptar. Off the gown, you revolting carpet mice! - [all exclaim] - [gasping] Listen, lady! Nobody messes with my dumb babies 'Cept me! [scoffs] I see London, I see France! I see Coco's underpants! Well, take a picture! This is the last time you will see Coco or her underpants! [gasps, seething] - [Coco wailing] - [Spike barking] - [exclaiming] - [growling] Bad dog! Bad dog! Oh! - Coco! Wait! - [barking] Go get him, Spike! Looks like Spike found himself a little patootie. Come here, my little pumpkin pies! [laughing] - Tommy, Dil! - Smile for the camera! - [Charlotte] What a holiday! - [Kira] Chuckie. I have something that belongs to you. Thank you, Kira. Chas, I am so sorry. I wanted to tell you about Coco, but-- No, no, no. It's my fault, Kira. I guess I got caught up in the romance of Paris. I'm sorry, little guy. "Oh, how my heart beats wild..." "Each time I hold my precious child." Wait! You know that poem? Oh, it is my favorite. [Stu] And now the bride and groom will cut the cake. Now, be careful, Kira, the knife is very sharp. Wasn't the wedding beautiful? Yeah, I'm just glad I didn't have to return the toaster oven this time. Let me put it to you this way, Bobfather. We've been back home for a bunch of yesterdays, and you still haven't delivered the goods! You gots your mommy wish, so what do I get, Snotfather? Angelica, you show him no aspect! You can't talk to him like... Angelica. You come to me on the day of my daddy's wedding to ask me for Cynthia Chateau and the matching ponies and a bunch of, just... stuff that I can't never get you. There you are, you guys! Come on. The growed-ups are giving away all the cake! - Cake? Game over! - [Lil] Yay! [all exclaiming] Wawa's a really nice bear. Thanks. My old mommy gived him to me. Do you ever miss her? Sometimes. But then I 'member that she's up there watching me from heaven. I guess I'm lucky. I got two mommies to look after me now. There's my little guy. Kimi? Sweetheart?
