- [Brian] I can't remember a time in my life when I was truly happy. Maybe I don't even believe that happy exists. My mom taught me how to say this prayer when I was a little kid just before I go to bed. You probably said it too. "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord, my soul to keep." It wasn't until I got older that that phrase, "If I should die before I wake" began to mean something much more to me than a cute little rhyme. I was a long distance runner in high school, wiry and fast. Even got a few trophies and some write-ups in the local paper. My mama was so proud when I got into Northwestern on an athletic scholarship. I was gonna be an engineer. That was a lifetime ago. Given everything that's happened maybe it was somebody else's life. Running is the one consistent thing in my life. It's therapeutic and it's cathartic. I get my head together. I think a lot clearer out here. I sorta went off the rails after my mother died. Being an engineer just wasn't that important anymore. I realized what I was metaphorically trying to run from, was running as fast as I was. the man in the mirror and all that be is. I hurt my back a couple of years ago. Thank God for having a doctor who's a best friend and a friend. I think I might be a little more dependent on Vicodin than I should be. But it dulls the pain. I hate myself just enough to continue these destructive behaviors. I wished I loved myself enough to stop. Making the wrong choices in life can be devastating. Reacting to those choices can be fatal. - No thank you. - What's up, man, how're you doing? - Good. - You're doing all right, man? - I am now. - Now? - What's so different than before? - I meant, I, I'm okay. - You're okay? - Yeah. - You come here often? - Once or twice I've been here. - It's my first time. - Oh, really? - Yeah, a friend told her about it. So I thought I should check it out. Pretty cool. You can have a good time, do you recommend it? - Yeah. - All the stuff going on What's your name? - My name is Brian. - Cedric. - Cedric. Nice to meet you, Cedric. - Can I buy you a drink? - Hey man, come down. I mean, it's a club, people have a good time, drink, meet up with people. I'm I right, man? - You're right. - Right. That's much better - Where's my drink, this bartender. Thank you. - There we go. - There we go. - Em, so First time? - First time. - First time. - What's up, man? What's wrong with you? You're all right? - Man, we need to talk. - No, I gonna lie to someone. - Michelle and I are getting serious. - Is that all? - Well, I mean, we won't be able to do this anymore. - Are you trippy, man? Just you have another one of your hallelujah come to Jesus meeting. It calls you to feel guilty about being who you are. - Cedric, come on. - No, you come on Brian. Every time you feel guilty about it, you pull this crap. Nobody forced you to get involved with this girl. When are you just going to stop hiding and be yourself. And who do you have to prove anything to, Brian? Do you love her? - I said it. - No, look at me, Brian. Do you love her? Tell me, do you love her? - What do you want me to say? - Of course not. How can you love anybody when you're so busy hating yourself? Let's say you married this girl, Brian. - Cedric, I didn't say anything about marriage. - Oh really? Then what did you mean about getting serious? Right. That's what I thought. God doesn't hate you as much as you hate yourself, Brian. I mean, what's going to happen the next time you get an itch and all this blows up in your face and you know it will. So sick and tired of you, man, I know what you want. Going back and forth with me, Brian. If you do this, don't call me anymore. I'm not hanging around and scratch your itch next time. I've let you back in way too many times already, Brian, and I'm not doing it again. I want a relationship with a man who has his head together. Not one that's scared of his own shadow. and makes his decisions based off what other people expect him to be. - You're right. And I'm sorry. - That's it, Brian. - Cedric. - No, that's it. I'm tired of you. I'm sick of you, Brian, I'm out. Don't call me, don't text me, I'm done with that. - Cedric - No, I'm out Brian. Keep your life together, Brian. - Cedric, a second. - Nice day for running. Nice day for praying. - What? - Just open your mouth and say the words, son. He'll hear you. - Daddy. - Daddy. - Errh. - Daddy, you stink. - Wait, no. You stink. - No, you stink. - Who said I stink? - Can't walk as long as you're holding his legs like that. Wait for me girls. Okay. - My love. - Mmh. You do stink. And you are so wet. You stink terribly. Oh, you got some bling-bling huh? - Yeah, found it running. - Okay. Are you okay, baby? - This back. I must overdone it, running again. - I really wish you go see a specialist. Whatever Darryl is prescribing you, obviously is not working. - I'm gonna go up and shower, okay? - Okay. I'll have dinner ready for you when you come down, okay. - All right. - All right. - a man got - Oh, I almost forgot. Mary Davidson called you today. Bae, did you hear me? - Yeah. Did she say anything? - She just said that it's really important. And she really needs to talk to you. - I'll give her a call later. - Okay. - I messed up. Please, help me. Help me. God. - Baby - Mana, I thought you'd be at work. - It's one O'clock. Though you'd be in school. I guess we were both wrong. - We only had a half day, so. I'm gonna go fix a sandwich. What are you doing with that? - I was putting clean sheets on your bed. - Did you read it? - What? Don't you dare raise your voice to me. - You know, I can't have no privacy in this house. - Excuse me. This is my house and everything in it. Is this stuff true? What I read? Have you been messed with, Christian? Tell me the truth. Were you molested? - No, why would you ask me that? - Because of the filth in this letter. - Did that man make you, Baby, did he do something to you, tell me. Tell me what he made you do. - He didn't make me do nothing that I didn't wanna do. That's right. I wanted it. He didn't have to force me. - He's a grown man, you're a child. He should know better. - Okay. Well, I knew what I was doing and I wanted to have sex with him and I did. Feel better now. - Were you 17? You don't know what you want. You're confused, that's all. He's brainwashed you or cursed you or something. I swear. That's all that's on the news these days. Adults abusing children. Baby, he's taken advantage of you. And so help me, God. I swear when I am finished with him, he'll be sorry he ever touched you. - I want you listen to me. I just said that I wanted this. Me, I did it. - Is he threatening you? - No. Now back off. - Back off. But, what about you'll never tell this word and I will have you take you up. Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You are my son, my responsibility. Just like Angel and Bethany. So I am not going to back off and allow anybody to hurt my kids and get away with it. - He didn't hurt me. Okay. First he didn't even want to. I went after him. Yeah, that's right. I went after him. Why can't you believe this is something that I wanted. If I killed somebody, will that my fault or would you try to blame somebody else for that too? - Christian, it is not the same thing. - And how was it different? If I knowingly picked up a gun and blew somebody's head off, the court would treat me like any other criminal, won't they? Like an adult? You see that on the news all the time too. Don't you? But because I wanted to have sex, I'm confused and I don't know what I'm doing, 'cause I'm just a kid, but, if I killed somebody, all of a sudden, I'm a man. Okay. Can I have my letter back? - No. - It's my letter. You know what, fine, keep it. - Chris! Chris! Chris, Chris. Open this door. Do you hear me? Open this door right now. Chris, Chris. - [Kids] Now let me lie down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake I pray Lord my soul to take. Amen. - Great job, girl give me a hug sweetheart. Okay, get to bed. Oh, you already got in. I like your style. I like your style. All right, have a good night. Love you guys - Where's mama? - She left. - Where'd she go? - I don't know, she was mad. Like she had been crying. - Ooh, Chris, are you in trouble? - Hey, Man. How're you doing? - Fine - Good. What're we having today? Gatcha. Hey, give me a second, my friend. Hello. - Hey Brian. It's me, Chris. Have you seen my mama today? - No. Why? - She knows, Brian. - Hello. - She knows, Brian. - She knows what, Chris? - She knows about what happened between us. - I got to go. - Brian. Shelly. Shelly, there's somebody at the door? - [Shelly] Answer it then. - You answer it, I don't live here. - [Shelly] Gosh, you are so lazy, obvious. Where's my tea? - Do I look like a babysitter to you? - You really don't want me to tell you what you look like, do you, dear? - Shelly, don't try me. - Oh, Hey, come in and tell me all about it. Come on in and sit down there. - Who is this delicious thing, - Hold your horses. Keep your tongue in your mouth. That's my son, Chris. - Son? - Yes. - Oh, you're the hot artists I've been hearing so much about. - Yeah, I guess so. - My name is Mercedes Bendz, I'm an entertainer. - Why don't you tell my son why you call yourself Mercedes Bendz? - 'Cause if you drive in one, a Benz's over. - You're so messy. - Oh, this one ain't got no sense of humor at all. - Probably not 'cause you're scaring him, dear. - Girl, I'm gonna go make myself look decent. - Honey, you look decent. Why do you - Shelly, don't get cut. - Look, Silvia, you know I love you like the one good testicle that I have left - And if you keep messing with me, you're going to lose that one too. - Dear. - Who is she? She's just an old friend from Chicago, honey. You don't pay her no mind. Would you like some coffee? Get you some coffee? - No, do you have any juice? - Apple or grape? - Grape. - One second, I'll be right back. Here you go, dear. - Thanks. That doesn't look like coffee. - Don't you worry what this look like. You drink your juice and let me drink mine and feel good. - Okay. - Jesus, oh. So, tell me, what's going on. - You remember I told you about this dude. I was on and off with for the past year, now? - Don't tell me his wife found out, Chris. - Worse. My mother, she found a letter that I wrote. - Hold up. You wrote a letter? We live in a social media generation and you wrote a letter. You could have text, Snapchat it, Facebook, or even tweeted. And you wrote a letter. Really Chris? I go away for a minute and you lose your mind. - Okay, I know. Okay. - So now mama Mary is on the warpath. - Yeah, that about sums it up. - Oh, gosh. Chris, did you at least give this man a heads up? - Yes. Okay, I tried to call him and then my mom was gone when I got up this morning. I don't know what she's gonna do. But if she sees him at church. - Whoa, church? You mean this man goes to the same church as you and your family. God, Chris. You know, I've never asked you about this guy. But is he the type to come after you to hurt you when shit hits the fan? - No. I mean, I don't know. I don't think he's like that. But you're not sure. And he and his family go to the same church that you and your mom go to? Hmm. It sounds like he's got some demons to deal with on his own. And these dear brothers get a sense of conscience, they go screaming back into the closet. I call them convenience gays and trust me, I've had my share of them. Chris, you needed to just leave this man alone. Leave it alone. - I can't. Okay, I care about him. And I think I love him. - Love? I told you from the beginning this was not gonna work. And now you're talking about being in love with them. - I know it's stupid. I know. - Chris, it's more than stupid. It's dangerous. - Okay. So then what do you, what do you think I should do? - You're handsome, gifted artist. You're about to go off to Art School on a scholarship. You don't need this. Leave this man alone. - Okay. What if I can't? - If you care anything about this man, you need to leave him alone. - Maybe mama won't do nothing. - Excuse me. When you and your mother lived up the street from us I got the evil life from her more than once. She didn't want you to hang around with us undesirables and trust me, your mom is not the type of woman to sit around on the sidelines, just praying. - I know, okay. I just, I can't stand being in the house anymore. I wish I would have left with - Really? You wish you would've left with that white girl. You know your momma would've had her arrested for kidnapping if he did. - I mean, after I turned 18, maybe I can move in here. - Pump your brakes, baby. You can't be moving in here with me because I'm not gonna have mother Mary coming up and trying to cut my head off. - Okay. So, then what do you think is gonna happen? - Look, baby I don't know. But one thing I do know, is you unleashed pure hell. - Tell me what he made you do. - He didn't make me do something that I didn't want to do. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ You did it you did ♪ it you did it for me ♪ ♪ You didn't have to do it ♪ ♪ I'm so glad you did it for me ♪ ♪ Just just for him ♪ ♪ I was being bitten by sin ♪ ♪ You did it you did it you did it Jesus ♪ ♪ Oh for me for you he did it ♪ ♪ He did it at a time ♪ but I like that he did ♪ ♪ Yeah Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Yes he did yeah yeah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ And you know he did it for you ♪ ♪ He didn't have to die ♪ ♪ He did it for me ♪ ♪ He did it for me ♪ ♪ Hallelujah. ♪ - We need to talk. - I was just headed out.

And I couldn't stop myself. It's like it was happening to somebody else. - You couldn't stop yourself? What kind of sick bustard does this to a child? - Chris is not a child. - He's my child. - Then you know, better than anybody what type of child here is? - What is that supposed to mean? - Chris is gay.

This is not an episode of "The Young and the Restless" or "Days of our Lives". That man is right. You could have told everybody in the world that you wanted this to happen. But in the eyes of the law and society, Mmh Mmh. No, you're the victim. - Victim? See, that's messed up. - I know it's messed up, Chris. But people get crazy when you go talking about sex, especially church people. The Lord knows, I don't know where they think we came from. But in situations like this, they got to blame somebody. And my dear boy, that somebody ain't going to be you. - Do you think he could really go to jail? - Just leave him alone, baby, for God's sake. You don't want to give mama Mary any more reason to pray than she already has. - Yeah, but - What is that? - It's across Brian headed up. I grabbed him when he shoved me. I was thinking about taking it back. - Didn't anything that I said get into the thick head of yours? - Yes, but - No buts boy, please. For God's sake, stay away from him. Why are you so fixated on him anyway? Why can't you find somebody closer to your own age? - Brian's not that old. He's only 30 and he's the only man I want to be with. - Lord, boy. You're about to make me beat you on the head down to the white meat. Jesus Christ. Let me see this thing. Wow. This cross reminds me of the cross my mother used to wear when she was alive.

That's my big brother. - I saw Tee coming to church last Sunday. I don't know why, but I thought I was going to see you too. - Chap, please. She told me all about that service dear. Hell would freeze over before I stepped foot up in any of that hypocrisy. - So you guys don't get along at all. - Ah, you do have the knack for melodrama my dear. That's an understatement. My brother doesn't even acknowledge my existence. I met his wife once, but I only think that that was by coincidence dear. And the saints would be mortified if the children knew. We haven't been really close since Mama died. And if I wouldn't have caught cancer. Oh, God let me down. But I've let him down too. How can you preach about love and say that you love God who you don't see but you can't love your own brother who you see every damn day? Until I understand that, me and God on the outs. - Just where do you think you're going? - Out. - No, you're not. - Yes I am. - No, you're not. - Yes I am. - Chris, you aint going anywhere. - I don't have any time for this. - All right, come on now, come on.

You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand your rights, sir? - Yeah. - Let's go. - You look tired? - We need to talk. - Baby, what is going on? - Where are the girls? - They're with my mother, but you talk to me. I've been calling you all night long, no answer. Where have you been? I called the barber shop, I spoke to Kevin. He said you were arrested. There was a fight. What happened, baby? Why didn't you call me? - I couldn't. I couldn't. I called Darryl, and he came and he bailed me out. - What is going on? - Michelle, all I ever wanted was to be normal. All I ever wanted to do was to love you. I never, I never wanted to hurt you. - Hurt me? You're scaring me. - I know. And I'm sorry. - You've been keeping something from me for weeks now, I can feel it. At first I thought it was your back spat that's getting worse, but no. You're you're, you're different. You're distant, Brian, Baby. Let me in, talk to me. - Growing up can be so hard when you don't know where you belong or where you fit in. You just wake up one day and you just, you just are, you're there, you look in the mirror and you don't even recognize yourself. - Brian? - The choices, the decisions that you made - I am trying to understand where you are coming from but no more talking in circles. If you really care about me, you'll just be honest. - All right. Here it is. When I was young, teenager, early twenties. I used to mess around with I used to mess around with other guys but that part of my life was over and done when I met you. I mean, I loved you. I thought that I could run and escape that part, but I couldn't. - Why were you arrested? - I had sex with a minor. - A minor? You said you mess around with other guys, men. Was this minor a boy? Who was it? You might as well tell me I'm going to find out anyway. - Michelle, it's not important. - Tell me. - Michelle, that doesn't matter. - Tell me. - Michelle, it doesn't matter. - Are you serious? Tell me. - Chris. - Chris, who? - Chris Egan. - Oh, my God. I'd have to be tested for STD - No, no, Michelle. I was careful. - Careful? If you were careful we wouldn't be going through any of this. If you were careful my entire world, when it just exploded. And you care. This is unreal. - Michelle. - That's why you've been acting so strange these past couple of weeks. Not going to church? Does Mary know? That's why she's been avoiding me and not wanting the girls to come over to her house. You're having sex with her son. How long? - What? - How long were the two of you? How many times? How did this even happen? - It just did, Michelle. - It just did? Seriously? You and Chris? This boy has been to my house around my girls? - Michelle, he did not touch our kids. - Of course not. Because he was too busy screwing my husband. Did you? - Did I what? - Did you molest him? - Michelle, no. It was, it was consensual. - Consensual? He is a boy and you are a man. How is that consensual, Brian? Look at me. Were there others? - No. - Other boys, other men, in our house, on our bed? - No. - If you didn't take advantage of him, how did it happen? - It's about a year ago, we were at church. We were just having basketball practice and Chris he was having trouble keeping up with the rest of the kids. So, I decided to stay at the practice, teach him how to shoot, how to hold a ball. We started horsing around, I went up for a layup and I made a mistake and elbowed him. Out of nowhere, he just kissed me. He came out of nowhere and he just - And you didn't stop him? - I tried to, I was mad. I wanted to punch him in the face. - But you didn't. And now here we. This is gonna be some, some lie, some sick perverted joke. - Michelle. - How could you do this to me? How could you do this to our family? What does that make you? - Michelle. - What does that make us? - Michelle, listen. - Don't touch me. Don't you touch me. I don't know what this is, but there's - Michelle - Nothing. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Michelle. Michelle? - Fuck No, no. No, no, no - All right. Y'all make some noise here tonight.
