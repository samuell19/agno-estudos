You took our money and played the good son. Shouldn't you pay us back, you schmuck! I'm a loanshark, not your buddy. Friggin' schmuck! Count your blessings. God gave us spares for situations like this. Know what I'm talking about? Here. And here. Pay up or I'll be plucking out your organs. I... I will pay up. I swear. I will pay you back. I'm sorry.

This is the interest. The principle is due tomorrow. If you don't bring it... you know what will happen. You can't go around pulling your gun out. Look. I'm balding because of you. So, wash your hair every day! Darn it. This isn't the first time. Why are you so worked up? Internal Affairs is sniffing around. They found out you frequent the slots while investigating another complaint! Don't they have anything better to do than dig into one of their own? So hunker down and keep a low profile, you hear? They're just waiting for a chance. Got it? They're here! Drinking while on the clock and going out to play slots. You certainly lead an interesting life. As if that wasn't enough you go around playing cowboy. Us police officers get a bad rap these days. Are you desperate to hit the airwaves? Not at all, I only shot blanks. That's crap and you know it. You fired live rounds without warning shots. Hell, those creeps were coming at me with knives. - Should I just take it? - Enough! Submit a report about the slots and you're suspended until the investigation ends. Yeah? - Are you from the academy? - What? Aren't you an academy graduate? So? While you got promotions filing reports I was working the streets and missed my promotion. How much longer should I clean up after you? Isn't it great to be an academy graduate? You schmucks took all the money, so I tried to earn some too, you lowlife. Are you really that jealous? Is that all? Yeah, that's all. You son-of-a-gun. What? Isn't it obvious? Return your piece. Come on. Cough it up. I left it at home. You did what? You crazy idiot... Are you really a cop? You told me not to use it so I left it at home. I'll return it tomorrow! Go get it right now! Now! Fine, I'll get it right now! Are you following me? Get lost! I can't! I said I'll bring it, you twerp! I'm coming along! Sure, if you have a death wish. I take these pills for anger management. You know it's a mental illness, right? But even with the medicine... - Detective! - I can't control myself! I'm just so pent up with anger! Hell, I'm a dead man. And what the hell is this? What's with your face? Boss, could I get an advance? How much? A year's worth. You take me for a fool? How do I trust you? What a joker. Joker... You have to pay for that! I don't have any money! I don't believe this nutcase. You're fired! Fine... fine! I'm in a bit of a pickle. Could I get my gun? Sure, if you bring me the money. My superiors are sniffing around. - I'll pay you back soon. - You will? How will you do that? Huh? Come on! That temper of yours. Walk away. Do me this favour. Would you, if you were me? Friggin' schmuck! I thought so. Get out. Evangelist of Job Creation! Congressman Moon Sang-ryol Sir, the survey results are in. How big is the gap? Almost double, sir. Is that so? You reap what you sow. Good work. We're losing by double the points. Why? Is there a plan in place? - Chief of Staff. - Yes, Councillor. To get what we want there's a price to pay. If people want more money give it to them. If I want double the votes then double it! If I want four times more then four times more it is! Please tell your clients about me. Of course, Councillor. You're here, Mr Baek! Here. It's been a while, sir. You've done really good work. You've been a very important asset. Not at all, sir. I'm lending a hand for a greater cause. Speaking of which... running a campaign requires a lot of funds. It's difficult work. Mr Baek. I need you to dig into the war chest. My family grew quite a bit and the economy has been bad... Mr Baek? Yes, Councillor? - Do you like dogs? - Dogs? I love to feed them! Dogs are superior to humans. They understand when I talk to them. They know the difference between a request and an order. My apologies, sir. It's no easy task to turn a loanshark into a banker before the congress. I'll have the funds ready, sir. So he wants to play without getting dirty? How much longer do I have to be his lackey? - Park here. - This is Baek. How have you been? I'm free these days so I'm... at a barber shop for my hair. If you're free, I have a job for you. A job? But I heard you've been out for a while. Don't you trust me? I'm Park! I don't doubt you but to get this job done... I'll be sending you a tool. Make sure you get it done right. Do you still smoke cigars? Of course I do. Park, the wall's not done! I got another job. So long. New York Seoul Seoul! Paris Paris Did you call for me, sir? How did the debt collection go? - Well... - Did you get it or not? By tomorrow... What did he say? Tell me! Hey! What did he say? He said he'll bring it... And do they always keep their word? If they keep their word, why am I paying you? I can just sit back and wait! Get up. Run an errand for me. Hell, are you friggin' serious? I'm running errands like a delivery boy. Yo! Come here. Me? Yeah, you twerp! What is it? Deliver this for me. That's not how we work. Here. Call there and request a pick up. If I tell you to deliver it, you deliver it. I'm sorry, but I'm really behind. How much? - I really can't. - I said how much! $5... Sinjung district... Here. Happy? Deliver it right now. Hell. I'm so behind... Hey. Feeling lousy? Yes. Deliver it properly. Or I'll kill you. What a day. This is the courier. Hello? Why is my soy crab order taking so long? Where are you located? Soy crabs! Could you tell me which district? - Leemun district! - I'm on my way there. - So when will you be here? - I said I'm coming. I have to leave soon. I'll be there in ten minutes. - When I arrive... - Hurry up! Hello? Hello? Hell... The light was green! It was green! If you want to die, die alone! Hell. What took you so long? What do you mean? I called over 20 times. I even went upstairs. I was home all day. Don't you lie to me. That's cash on delivery. $3, please. What are you talking about? They said it's free delivery. Don't ask me. You should ask the seller. Don't try to con me. Who's conning whom? I'm not paying! You've got to be kidding. Then I'm taking it back. Hey! - I don't believe this. - $3, please. I need that money. Why you! Mum, he smells like poop. Pass the 9th Level Civil Examination! Yes? This is the hospital. Have you submitted the consent form? And have you made payment? Do I really have to pay by tomorrow? Her condition is worsening. We can't afford to wait. How could you lose that money! You don't deserve to live. Just kill yourself... I'm sorry, Mum. Please forgive your terrible son. That creep, he said it's made of leather! He lied! Anyone home? A pack of Halla. Mr Park. Why do you do that every time? I'm sorry. Darn it! Anyone home? Hello, I'm delivering... Are you OK? I didn't order anything. It's for your neighbour next door. Could you pass it to him? Sorry, I'm afraid I can't. I'm really sorry. I'm in a rush, so please. I... won't be able to give it to him. May I ask why not? I... I'm going to kill myself right now. Kill yourself? He could just say no instead of coming up with such an excuse. Making me feel like crap. What happened to treating folks with sincerity? I get no respect because I'm a courier. Hell. I only make a few cents per delivery. I'll be wasting gas if I make another trip back to deliver this. It may not be much, but it's a lot to me. I've never said this to anyone before but I deliver over 100 packages a day. And if I don't deliver them all my wage gets docked. It's not an easy job, but I try to... Fine! Fine, I got it. You got it? Why do I still feel so lousy? I should really quit. Hot! Cigars for a labourer? What a joke. Why is an old man playing with toys? If this were real, I could die painlessly. Hell! I almost killed myself... I can't die today. Mum. Hang in there just a bit longer. Oh my goodness! You've really let yourself go. Had you lent me $2,000... Someone's coming to see your room so tidy it up. Hell, I wasn't going to do this, but... "Hell"? Who the hell you think you are? You talk to your mum with that filthy mouth? Give me your money! Don't you dare threaten me! I've had it with you! You must be out of your bloody mind! You thought you could threaten me with a toy? Spineless twerp! - Ma'am! It's dangerous! - You schmuck! What do you take me for? How dare you! You! Hey! Back already? Do you have any cash? What am I, an ATM? Why do you always ask me for money? Going to play poker at Baek's? I told you to be careful of Internal Affairs. I'm in this mess because of those creeps. What about them? I need to pay Baek to get my gun back. Are you nuts? How could you use your gun as wager? - So you have any cash? - You know I'm broke. Then shut your friggin' trap! Who's the hotshot drug pusher these days? Oh, what... Even BB pellets hurt quite a bit. This model has gunpowder in the cartridge so it fires like a real gun. But the muzzle is blocked so it can't fire real bullets. This particular one has also been modified. It sounds like a real gun, bang! It fires BB pellets, so you can shoot too. There's no better choice. It has the same heft as the real thing. How much? I've never seen you before. What do you do? These are illegal so we don't sell to walk-ins. Detective Choi, Seoul Metro Police Happy? - Yes? - Where are you now? I'm almost there, keep the dealer occupied. Don't worry. See you soon. Yeah. OK. Hurry, copper. Oh. What is it? Oh, you got the money already? Detective Choi, good to see you. Out of Order Hell, a cop? Where is he? Slot 11. Hell, who are you? - Tell me, creep. - Yes. Spill it, now! But I've never been so clean in my life. I'm done dealing. I'm clean. Don't you ever change up your script? Who are you trying to fool? - Hold still... - Yes... What is this... What are these? What are you doing? Oh, crap... If you got shot here what happens? You know how justified self-defence works. OK... I'll talk. I'll talk. Please move that gun. - I'm going to pee my pants. - Shush. Make the call. Hey, mate. About the deal today... same fishing spot? Holy crap! Oh, gun! He has a gun! Who the hell are you? Ooh, I'm so scared. You moron. You were going to rob this joint with a toy gun? What a moron. I'm letting you off the hook since I'm busy. But I'll kill you next time. Got it? Yes. Crazy son-of-a-gun. Toy gun, my butt. Moron. Ahn had better do his job right. This is my money. I've worked real hard for this. Freeze! D-D-Don't move! - I said, don't move! - OK! - Don't shoot! - Stand back. Going, I'm going, standing back! The money... Put them all in the bag. This money? - Put them in the bag! - OK... OK! - Hurry! Come on! - I'm on it! - Are you... - Don't turn around! - I won't! - Don't turn around! I won't... OK, almost done. Don't move! OK, it's hooked, almost there! Hey. Good to see you. Where's the Councillor's money? The thing is... I was told to cut something off if it's not ready. Cut what? It's almost ready. I'll bring it over. If I have to come here again... I won't leave empty-handed. He took off with the golf bag? Find out who he is. But if the Councillor finds out he won't let it slide. What do we do? We'll find out very soon who dies first. Did you deliver the package like I told you? Yes. Incoming call: Killer Park - Yes. - Mr Baek. When do I get the tool? What did you say? You said you delivered it! What happened? I sent it via courier. Do you even know what that was? Just cigars, right? Maybe this is better. I prefer... a tool that I'm used to. Then proceed, please. But don't make a mistake. Or we're all done for. Don't you worry. I'll call afterwards. Seoul! Paris Why did you send it via courier! I thought it was just cigars! You useless twerp. Why the hell would I send you on a smoke run? Put your hand here. Boss! Mr Baek! - I'll bring it back! - Let go! Please give me one last chance. If you don't retrieve the gun I'm taking your hand off. - Got it? - Yes, sir! Let go! Driver: Lee Kyung-min That friggin' courier! Why won't it budge? Go... and fetch this joker. He... quit earlier today. Get him here right this second! He quit. He got fed up with all the customers. That lowlife rat! I'm a bit busy... Where are you going? Why are you picking on me? Hey. Do you know his address? So long, Councillor Moon. Goodbye, Moon. I really should quit. Mum. Surgery Consent Form You'll get your surgery... Mr Park? What are you doing over there? Are you OK? My feet went numb. Just my luck. Why do I have so many crazy tenants? Thank you... That feels good. You're actually having lunch? Good to see you, twerp! If you lie to me, I'll kill you on the spot. What? I understand. We do what we've got to do... He can't even pay rent, but he plays golf? - Is this it? - Yes. The second floor. What the hell... I don't think he's home. Hell... There's no one here, you schmuck. What did I tell you? You lie, you die. All right, close your eyes. Consider yourself lucky. Sorry for hitting you earlier. If you did your job right we could've avoided this. It's OK... - Hey. - Yes? Come here. You lying creep! You lowlife rat! Yeah! Die! Hey! Did you pass out? Hey! Hell! Who the hell plays golf? Hey. I told you to do it right. Or you die, right? Die. Die! Die, you schmuck! Oh... Why is this here? How dare you... Mr Ahn? No... Mr Ahn? Oh, I don't believe this! Wait... Sir, there! Stop behind that car! A new face? Who are you? The dealer sent me. You lack the basic deal manners. The merchandise? Give it a taste. Yes, Boss. Oh. It's good, Boss. The money? Here. What the hell? I think it's just some drunkard. Crap, it's a trap! What the hell? That friggin' dealer sent us a copper! - Look! - Drop the knife. Would you if you were me? You're outnumbered, four to one, right? Freeze, I'll shoot. You can't be in this line work without nerves of steel, can you? Isn't that right? What the hell are you doing? Take his gun. - And I'll give you the money! - Seriously? You'll get all of it! - Stay back. - Cut him to pieces. - Turn him into fish food! - I will shoot! Wait! Walk away... before I change my mind. Let's not shed blood today. What the hell is this? Boss! Please, please help... 30 minutes ago I killed a man. I killed a man! I killed a man... I killed a man... You crazy son-of-a-gun! Wait... Wait. Remember me? It's all your fault. Right, it's my fault. And you're clearly innocent! Don't you think it's unfair to die like this? You have to live and enjoy this world. Enjoy this world? I'm going to rot in jail! Wait... wait! Why are you so impatient? I'm not done talking! Why would you rot in jail? What? Look at this. Like this, yeah? If I do this... there's no evidence that you killed him. There's no witness either. I owe that creep money so I have reason to kill him and... he died in my place! Everything points to me as the killer so why would you rot in jail? What are you saying? If you give me the bag I'll take full responsibility. Really? Yes, I mean it. I really do! It's OK. Everything's fine. Mistakes happen and sometimes people die. If you hadn't killed that scumbag, I would've! Think of this as stepping on poop. It's going to stink for a bit but it'll go away. OK? Good... slowly. Careful... Slowly... Hello? Is this 911? Hell, just my bloody luck. Bloody hell. Hey, are you OK? Hey! Why the hell is he playing golf at night? It's OK... Let go of it. That's it. Everything's just peachy... You're alive, that's good enough. Someone will be here soon. No... Bloody hell! HG Capital Hell... Hell... I want it now. What? My gun. What the hell? What the hell? Hey! Are you nuts? What's your problem? Come at me! Bloody hell! This should be enough to cover my debt. Go on, bring me the gun! It's... not here. - What? - Your gun isn't here. Get my gun right now, scumbag! Before I put a hole in you. - What's this gun? - Doesn't matter! Get my gun! I'll get it to you soon. So, wait a little. And please calm down. I want my mum's surgery money, darn it! Friggin' hell... Bloody schmuck! - Hey! - Get off me! You son-of-a-gun! Yeah? What? He looked like trouble. I knew he'd do something like this. That creep is going to drive the property prices down. Why did you do it? Hey, watch the stairs. He got his skull bashed in. My goodness. - What happened? - He's almost unrecognisable. - What? - Whoever did this is a fiend. He bashed his face in and even threw up on him. I've never seen a case this gruesome. Hey, look at this. It looks like he owes Mr Baek money. The weapon? Something blunt, but we haven't found it. Did you find anything else? Anything else? Like what? Never mind, forget it. Officer Kim! Send out an APB and call me once when you find him. - Got it? - Yeah, got it. - We can't do without it! - Got it? Yeah, got it. Let me make myself clear. Call me first. I said I got it. Take a chill pill. Did you ask for me, sir? Does Mr Baek have it ready? He hasn't called yet... Do you still not get it? Councillor! Time is money, they say. It must not be wasted. Spare me, Councillor. Don't kill me, please. Boss. Boss Hammer, please! Do your job right. You hear me? Answer me! I hear you. Quiet, Hammer! Everything's messed up because of you! Do you work for Detective Choi? Do you? Open your eyes! He's really out of it. Guess what happened to me. Remember what I said? Yes... well, something cropped up. I need to cut something to feel better. I was going to dry them first. They are wet. You'd better not be lying. Of course not. I'll... bring it to the rally personally. Why isn't he dead yet? Here! Good! Good boy. Goodbye, Moon. Incoming call: Foxglove Mob #2 What is it, boy? Who could it be living behind this tall wall? Eat this and live well. What? That schmuck is a real piece of work. Mr Baek. The cops are sniffing around. When will you get the job done? - My life is on the line! - Calm dow in. I promise I'll get it done by tomorrow. So don't call me. You'll only distract me. I'll call after it's done. Oh, yeah. I got the tool you sent me. I'm the police. Do you have a minute? What the hell? What now? Where did you get this gun? You friggin' schmuck. Money is the least of your worries now! What? Where the hell is my gun? It's... Why is Ahn's head bashed in? And why does someone else have my gun? I can explain... What the hell are you up to? Spit it out! Start talking or I'll bury this in you! I'll talk! Please... Where is he? Get him on the phone. Call him now! The number you're dialling is unavailable. Please call back later. Where the hell are you? Bring the gun back! Answer me! Hell! Is everything ready? Yes, all part-timers are in place. And Mr Baek? He said he'll bring it there personally. Perfect. Great work. Hey! I'll deal with you when I get back. You still can't reach him? The evangelist of job creation. I'm Moon Gwang-ryol. And what have I accomplished in the past eight years? Out of the entire work force in the country what is the proportion of small and middle businesses? 99%! It's an incredible figure. 99%, that's amazing. According to statistics those businesses account for 87.5% percent of all employment in the country. This is the position for someone who is ready to represent you. You must remember that, dear citizens. I'll do my best until the end of my days! For our youths! Councillor! Councillor, are you OK? What happened? Who are you? Who are you? Councillor! Hey! My golf bag! My golf bag! Get it back! Stop! Councillor. Mr Baek, this gun doesn't work. I don't know anything about this... Councillor! I don't believe this! Hell! Hell... Don't follow me! Go away! I'm leaving! I'm going! Stay back. Stay back! Or I'll toss this! I really will! Give me the bag, I'll cover this up. You have my word. Go to hell! I know you'll kill me! Sweet talk doesn't work on you. What should I do with you? I'd rather die! That crazy son-of-a-gun! Hey, I got a bite. Hey... Fish it out. Help! Pull him up before he dies. Fish him out. Hold onto this! Hey! I'm glad you retrieved the gun but what happened? A congressman, a gangster... a toy gun, an axe and a bag of cash. And why were you driving that truck? Detective Choi. This is not going to go away just by keeping mum. Why are you taking the fall anyway? I got a tip about Baek providing illegal campaign funds for Moon. That's why I was there. Then we should've worked on it together. We're a team! Or were you after a promotion for yourself? You're too much. I mean... why does a chief of staff need an axe? It's for security. To protect the Councillor. Too many loonies out there. Look at this. You tried to use casino money to fund his campaign, no? And I know you two were the top dogs of Foxglove mob. Foxglove? Is it for gardening? Don't patronise me, Councillor! What's this money then? I don't know what this money is for. You were funding an illegal campaign! Illegal campaign? You'd better watch your mouth. The public has their eyes on this case. Hey. So, whose money is this? Tell me... Me? Well... This money... belongs to that man. So, this is your money? Yes. It's my money. Nonsense. You were behind on rent! How did you get so much money? This is my mother's surgery consent form. To pay for the surgery... I signed an organ waiver form and got this loan. I took out the housing deposit for my apartment and got $10,000. But the loansharks took all my money... so I had to put my organs as collateral... for this money. Really? I see. It all checks out. The nurse said he left to get the money. And the attempted murder on Baek's man? The victim says it wasn't him. It was someone else. That must really be his money. I will call the cops. You all said so yourselves. This is my money. No? Is it not? - Shall I tell them the truth? - Hey! What's there to tell? It's your money. Just go. Min-je! Keep that money safe. Here's your receipt for the surgery. Mum. What happened to you? Nothing. Did something happen? It was nothing. I fell down the stairs yesterday. I'm hungry. Have you eaten? Let's go eat... Slow down. Go on, eat! Mr Kim? - Are you ready for your check-up? - Yes. - I'm with the police. - How may I help you? Which room is Mr Kim Min-je in? Patient name: Kim Min-je First news of the day. A 55-year-old suspect was released from custody today after disrupting an election campaign. Why did you do this? I don't get it. It was a cop's gun... but it fired BB pellets. Baek wouldn't give me the wrong gun... One comment, please. Why did you do this? I... I need to make a living too. - Stay in bed, please. - OK. Kim Min-je! - Hell! - Stop right there! - Are you OK? - I'm not. Open up! Open up. - What for? - Open the door. Stop that! Don't follow me! Go away! Look at this twerp. Give me a friggin' break!
