Official selection for the 1967 National Arts Festival A SHOCHIKU PRESENTATION A Hyogensha Production - Here to relieve you of your post. - Nothing to report. Let's go now! Hurry it up! Hurry! August 10th, 1937. Reserve-component Privates Makoto Kiyokawa and Kazuo Saegusa, assigned to 5th Squad, 3rd Company, 20th Fukuchiyama Infantry Regiment, deserted after the change of guard. Again? Maybe they longed to see their pretty wives? What're their hometowns? They are both from the same village. It is Kutsuki, in Takashima District, Shiga Prefecture. Alright, put out an APB in that area at once! Yes, sir! Wait! Remember, we absolutely must catch them. If this gets out, it will affect people's morale. Yes, sir! It's dangerous if we stay together. Let's split up. We'll take the 5 o'clock train to Kyoto from Maizuru. Saegusa, you get on at Magura. I'll join you from Umezako, one stop ahead. We'll meet up in the third car from the front, okay? They stole clothes from farmers in Kokai village. Their uniforms were found on the Kurotani mountain. On Kurotani? If the uniforms were found here,. then they are trying to reach the Maizuru line. Alright, increase patrols between Ayabe and Maizuru. Nakahara, you go straight to Umezako. Now, where the hell did you come from? And where are you headed? Hey! Hey! Freeze! Stop right there! You two, go over to the other side! - Yes, sir! - Stop! - Stop right there! - Don't think you can get away! - Stop already! - Give it up! CLOUDS AT SUNSET Producer: Masayuki Nakajima Original Novel: Tsutomu Minakami Screenplay: Naoyuki Suzuki Cinematography: Masao Kosugi Art Direction: Shigemasa Toda Lighting: Akira Nakamura Music: Toru Takemitsu Recording: Hideo Nishizaki Editing: Yoshi Sugihara Cast Shima Iwashita Tsutomu Yamazaki Kei Sato Mayumi Ogawa Sumiko Hidaka Yoshiaki Hayanagi Kinzo Shin Ranko Akagi Choichiro Kawarasaki Kiyoshi Nonomura Junkichi Oda Ayako Murou Directed by: Masahiro Shinoda Well, then, take care and have a good day. Matsuno, drinks for the second floor. Coming! Matsuno, you have a free room? - The luxury room is vacant. - I see. - Auntie, three more, please. - Sure. And down you go. Pretty lively here. It's a farewell party. Here you go, sir. Must be an army send off party. If they keep answering to these "let's go to war" cries, sooner or later there will be no more men left in Japan, will there? That's right. And I'm one of those doomed men. - Please take good care of me. - You're so dirty! Matsuno, where's that sake? Coming! Matsuno, warm me a bath, please. I'll see to it right away. You have it tough here, toiling for that greedy old hag. - Was that a new customer? - Yes, it's Ritsuko. Who is she with? I don't know him, but he seems like a lacquer artist. She must be making good money with all the men she keeps changing around. Matsuno, pour me one. Sure. - Yes, come here... - No, stop it! Right this way, please. Ritsuko! Ouch! That hurts! Alright, I'm sorry! Let me go, please! Pervert! Listen, Matsuno. I'm thinking of leaving Wajima. I'll probably get sick if I don't stop working at this dismal place. If I keep working as a hostess, I might be better off in a hot spring resort. The guests who come to hot spring resorts, they all go there just for a one-day excursion. They spend their money differently. Here we only get lacquer shop keepers and fishermen for customers. It's bad business. I've told you this before. But I used to be a geisha in Togi. I'm thinking of going back to that trade. If I'm going to work in this business anyway, might as well go all out. Say, Matsuno, are you okay with staying here? Why don't you come with me to the hot springs? Matsuno! Someone's here! Coming! Brother! Matsuno, is everything alright? What do you mean? Did something happen? I got a draft notice... I'm supposed to enlist in Kanazawa. Draft notice? Yeah. I'm taking the last train at 9 o'clock, so I don't have much time. You're leaving today? Isao, wait here a minute, please. The war's been going on since last year. So, if I enlist now, I'll definitely end up on the front lines. I just wanted to see you once before that. That's why I came. Mom and dad will be lonely if you go... I am worried about dad's health, but this is for the good of the country. You shouldn't think about stuff like that. This is all the money I can spare. Take it as a farewell present. I won't need it where I'm going. If you have money to spare, send it back home instead. I'm working really hard to provide for both of them, so take this. And don't worry about us. Thank you. I'll be going, then. I'm leaving it to you. Take care. Isao! No need to worry about us! I'll work hard and send them money. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! ♪ Our loyal and valiant troops ♪ Who fight the wicked in the name of Heaven ♪ We send them off with cheers... You're an idiot, receiving this letter... You're not really thinking about following that tramp Ritsu, and going to the hot spring resort, are you? You can't be serious about this. Look here. I took you in, and I've been taking care of you. Thought I'd give you a chance to work, and support your family back home. And here you are, listening to her nonsense. "Let's go to the hot springs!" Do you know what hired girls do in those towns? Do you have any idea? It's much the same as being a prostitute. Getting sick and dying from illness... There are plenty of hired women over there going through hell. Is that what you want for yourself? Welcome! Can I help you? Madam. How can we help you? Can you put me up for 4 or 5 days? Yeah. - Take him to the Plum Room. - Sure. Come on in. Come with me. Where're you going? To the marketplace. You're taking a walk? That's right. I think I might go over there with you. It's this way, let's go. Are you from this town originally? No... Ever heard of Sosogi? Sosogi beach? I know it. You from there? It's a place called Otani... When you go inland from Sosogi beach. - Near Otani mountain pass, isn't it? - Yes. They say that, long ago, a man named Taira no Tokitada ran away to that place after losing at the Battle of Dan-no-ura, and settled there with his 16 retainers. It's a poor mountain village. Then, that makes the villagers descendants of the Taira? Yes. It means noble blood runs through your veins. No wonder you're so pretty. How much is this? I love stonefish. Do you like stonefish, mister? Yeah. What business brought you here? I'm a salesman for a canned food company. What I do is to go around and take orders for canned food. Then, you must have traveled all over the country. - Do you know Yamashiro? - Yes, I know it. Please tell me what it's like. How should I describe it? It's one of the three big hot springs in Hokuriku. It also has some nice inns. There's even one that hosted the Emperor. Mister. I want to go there, but I wonder if there's any work to be found... What, you don't like working here? I have a sick father. I have to send him a lot of money. There're a lot of places you can find work in, as long as you have courage to go out and try. What made you decide on Yamashiro? I have a friend there. Right. She moved from here. She asked me to come with her. But I couldn't make up my mind about it. It's a good place, Yamashiro. It's on a whole 'nother level compared to Wajima. Mister, if you ever go to Yamashiro again, please see Ritsuko, at a geisha place called "Yamano House". Tell her that Matsuno from Wajima is waiting for her chance to come over. Please tell her this. - Yamano geisha house? - Yes. Okay. Alright, then. Thank you, Madam. - Thank you. - Goodbye. The guys at the party today were so rough. - Disgusting. - Yeah, they were so nasty. Alright, girls, see you. - Goodbye. - Goodnight. Bye. Welcome back. You have a visitor, Ritsuko. What? Who is it? Oh, Matsuno! You're here, I can't believe it! Yes, I'm here. Please help me out. I'm so glad you came. Hey! You know a guy named Inasuke Kosugi? Yes, I know him. We met at a local inn called Kuraya. - Did he cause you any trouble? - He's not like that! We talked about finding a place for you if you came here, and he said, since he's a regular at the Kuraya inn, that he would take care of it if you want. To tell you the truth, Ritsuko, even after I got the letter from you, I still couldn't make up my mind. But, when I got a postcard from Mr. Kosugi saying he'll be at Kuraya for 4 or 5 days, I decided to take the plunge and come here. Then, Mr. Kosugi is at Kuraya right now? Yes. Really now? That's great! Kuraya is a good inn. You should go there if you trust him so much. Look, Matsuno. Unlike me, you have parents to look after. You have to be strong. If you fall into the business of selling yourself like we did, you're done for. Well then, Kuraya will do fine. I wish I could go with you to help you settle everything. But I have an appointment tonight. You'll go out alone and meet Mr. Kosugi? I'll go and say hi to him as soon as I come back tomorrow. Did you buy all this after coming here? I guess. We were scorned by the proprietress of Sanoya and everyone there. Treated us like whores. I guess that was inevitable. So, I didn't feel angry at all. And, to be frank, I have my own agenda here. Working as prostitutes in Kannomachi, we all toiled trying to pay off our debts and the prices of our kimonos. And the one who gets rich is the Madam. Working at that place was a waste. So, I thought, working as a hostess, taking your own customers, that might be a lot better. If you don't like them, you don't have to sleep with them. The customers I've taken at Sanoya were mostly good guys. And all their money went to me. So, I was able to save up. It's how I bought my cabinet, my dresser and the Buddhist altar. At any rate, Matsuno, things are a bit different since I came to Yamashiro. I can't do the kinds of things I did in Wajima anymore. I might spend some time with friends, like right now, but, from now on, my main interest is in learning the geisha art, attending parties and getting paid. Is the one you're going out with your lover? It's an old man who's a regular at the inn. People here are too noisy. So, I'm going to Yamanaka hot springs to meet with him. In any case, you're not like me. You're still a virgin, you need to take care of yourself. Alright. I'll work diligently, so I wouldn't embarrass you and Mr. Kosugi. Give it your all. Is Mr. Kosugi your boyfriend by any chance? No way. Fine, if you say so. Mr. Kosugi is a serious man. Other customers would often be rude and grab my butt, but he never did such things, he was very gentle. Alright then, I'm going out. It's already late, so you can stay here. I'll go with you to the Kuraya tomorrow, so you can rest easy tonight. - I'm gone. - Okay. Auntie? Auntie? Excuse me... Is Mr. Kosugi here? Yes, he's here. Hey, show her the way to Mr. Kosugi's room. Yes. Follow me, please. It's this way. Mr. Kosugi, you have a visitor. It's you, Matsuno? You came at last. Yes. I was supposed to come greet you with Ritsuko, but she couldn't come because of her work, so I came here on my own. Come on in, then. Alright. How's your dad been holding up? He's been drifting in and out of consciousness. Ah, sorry to hear that. If we could only get him admitted to a hospital, I think it would make it easier for my mother. But getting someone admitted is expensive... - You're in a tough spot. - That's right. Mr. Kosugi, please. Could you help me get a job here as a maid? If you start working here, I'll be able to help you out anytime, you know. Plenty of maids here, and the work's not as hard as in other places. Also, you get a monthly pay plus tips. How much were you making in Wajima? Three yen. That's awful! Here you'd get room and board, and about 11 or 11,50 yen. 11 yen! Thank you! I'd be overjoyed if I had this. I could send a lot of money back home. Mr. Kosugi, can you come down a bit? Ma'am is calling for you. Good timing. Let's go down together. Mr. Kosugi, here's a written order for canned food. Thank you, thank you. Finding nice girls like her... You're really good at that, aren't you? So, what do you think? Quitting that low income canned food business of yours, and go around finding new maids for me. It will be much more profitable for you. Stop being ridiculous. I'm a salesman for a food company, this is my real job. I won't go into business selling girls to you. I'm being serious. It's not just this place, there's a shortage of maids in the whole town. You travel around Hokuriku all the time. You're the perfect person for this. Come on. Why not take some time and think about it? You're a working man, aren't you? Aren't you tired of constantly being used by your employer? If you agree to help me out with finding maids, I'll definitely make it worth your while. At any rate, that girl you found is so sweet. Sorry I kept you waiting so long. Will they let me work here? About that... I talked to Oshigi, the head maid here, and they might be able to take you. But the issue is money. We talked about your situation, and, while she understands your plight, she can't pay you more than she does the other maids. "Instead of a maid, why doesn't she try becoming a hostess?" "It's much more profitable that way", that's what she said. You can earn up to 3 yen in fees on a single day. Going by that, you can get 80 to 90 yen a month. So, however high your food expenses are, you should be left with 50 yen. That's how much you can send to your dad in the country. 50 yen? Mr. Kosugi, I wonder if there's a place that would take me as a hostess? You're so young and pretty. If you made up your mind to be a hostess, any house in Yamashiro would gladly take you. Mr. Kosugi. I'll take every penny I can get for my family. I must help my sick father get better. I think this is my responsibility while my brother is at war. Mr. Kosugi, please help me find a place to work as a hostess. I'd like to get Ritsuko's advice on this, but I'm sure she'll agree when she hears my reasoning. Feel free to ask her advice if you want, but if you want to become a hostess, you'll have to rely on me. No matter how experienced she may seem, Ritsuko is still just a girl. If you don't have a man as your go-between, you'll end up being deceived. You don't want to end up in trouble later. Yes, thank you so much. Alright, then. Satomi Hostesses sleep here on the 2nd floor. They're all at a party, so it's all empty now, but we have six girls living here. And apart from that, we have about ten more who stay somewhere else. If you join us, you'll also stay in this room. Understood. They're all young, so it can get lively in here. I heard you were a maid in Wajima, but I think being a hostess will do you better. You'll be making a lot of money. And you'll also have the freedom to do whatever you want. I wouldn't try to tie you down or anything. Sounds great. Well then, I'll go and make the arrangments with the Madam. - You wait for me here. - Sure. That girl is very pretty. She'll make a good hostess with a little polish. Oshige from Kuraya really liked her. She wanted to have her as a maid there, but I brought her here. I know, I know. A poor girl from the Noto countryside, sacrificing herself to try and take care of her sick father. Seeing noble girls like that volunteering themselves to work as hostesses, I don't know why, but it makes me feel sorry for them. - Take good care of her. - Yes, of course. I'll treat her like my own. She's too innocent to be your daughter. And she may not like the idea of being your daughter. Oh, come on! Is that all, Mr. Kosugi? Right. Matsuno. I had a good talk with Madam downstairs. She understands about you needing to send money back home. She said she'll treat you like you're her own. So, please feel at home once you move in here. Thank you. - I'll be going, then. - Alright. - Give it your all. - I will! If you have any problems, write to me in Kanazawa, will you? This is my address. Thank you very much. I'm truly grateful. Take this. Even as a hostess, you won't start making money right away. - I can't! - Don't worry and just take it. I can spare this kind of money when business is good. Goodbye, Mr. Kosugi. Is it okay if I go eat some noodles at the stall? Oh, you still haven't had dinner? Yeah, I didn't eat anything since this morning. I'll be off, then. Udon noodles, please. Coming. What's the matter, Ritsuko? Matsuno? I didn't sleep at all last night, so I'm really tired. Did everything go well with Mr. Kosugi? Yes, he helped me out. I'll go and say hi to the Kuraya proprietress after I take a nap. Ritsuko, I went for a place called "Satomi" in the end, not Kuraya. - Satomi? - Yes. Isn't that the place for hostesses? That's right. Both Mr. Kosugi and Miss Shigeko agreed that if I wanted to make a lot of money, Satomi would be a better place. There's no way Shigeko would say something like that. You're not suited to that place. Ask anyone at any inn and they'll tell you Satomi girls are a bunch of loose women. Why the hell did he take you there? Now, I'm angry all of a sudden. When you sent me those postcards from Wajima, I remember you writing "I'd do anything, even become a hostess". But I didn't want you to work as a hostess. You only say that because you know nothing about it. You think it's an easy job, with good pay... However, it's actually very hard. First of all, you'll have to wear a kimono just like a geisha's. When you come back from a party with a dirty kimono, that goes out of your pay. Everyone pays for their own expenses. So, most of the money you get will be spent on the kimono. The reason you don't get paid as much as a geisha, even though you dress the same, is just because you don't sing or play the shamisen. But the customers still see you as a geisha. You'll have to spend the same money on cosmetics and gratuities. So, the money you get may seem like a lot, but since the expenses are high, it doesn't come to much. What are you going to do about the kimono, Matsuno? You don't even have one. Mr. Kosugi explained that to the Madam. "He explained", well even if he did, you'll have to pay a high rent to wear it. You won't be able save any money like that. And, even if we leave the cosmetics and kimono costs aside, say you end up borrowing them from someone. Though there are things you can't borrow, you mustn't forget the most important thing. Here in Yamashiro, unlike in Wajima, when a customer calls for a geisha or a hostess, most of them want to spend the night with her, too. Now, geisha, since they have a proper trade, they can pick and choose who they sleep with. But what about the hostesses? When you go out to pour drinks for them, and they ask the inn housekeeper to request you sleep with them, you have to help her keep face. At this point, you can't refuse. Having your body defiled little by little is all you have to look forward to. If you think pouring drinks is all there is to being a hostess, you're dead wrong! Just try declining with: "Oh, I'm not that kind of girl". The housekeeper will start giving you dirty looks come next day. I could go on, Matsuno... Ritsuko, based on what you just said, you're obliged to sell your own body as a hostess? Well, it's not like you have to do it no matter what... In that case, I'll hold fast. No matter how customers try to tempt me, I won't listen to them. You say may say that, but it's not them you have to worry about. It's the inn housekeeper. I'm talking about situations where you have to do it, or she loses face. I didn't think being a hostess was like that. You idiot! Look, we do have some honest hostesses here, but the Satomi ones are all loose women. You come to attend a party, but you're really there to be picked out. - Because sex is their true business. - Ritsuko! Thank you... I get what you're saying. I didn't know Satomi was such a place. I get that, but I'm an honest worker, so you don't need to worry. I did this because I wanted money to send home to my dad... That's why I asked Mr. Kosugi. Right... It's because you have a place you call home. You really have it tough. However... There will come a time when that won't be true, Matsuno. And when I think of that, I feel sorry for you. I got in this for the money, and I ended up like this. When I think of that, Matsuno, you're the one person I don't want ending up in such a place. Do you understand me? I don't have the right to say something like this to you. But, still... When I think of your situation, I just can't help it. Ritsuko, don't worry. I look up to you. I love you. I won't do anything to make you sad. I think of you as my own sister. I'll be careful when I work, so you don't have to worry about me. Okay? Don't worry yourself, cheer up. Kiku, lend me that comb for a second. Is my lipstick colour good? It's so hot! I'd love to have some shaved ice now. - Hear, hear. - Treat us, will you? No way! Too expensive. - Hey! - So stingy. Matsuno. Come on over here. Alright. Here, I'll give you a hand. There we go. - Hey, Runo? - Yes? You think this colour would look cuter on Matsuno? Yeah, you're right. Face up. The powder on her neck, wouldn't it be better if it was thicker? You think? Matsuno? When you're done with your makeup, put on this kimono. - Alright. - Here it is. Wow! It's so nice! It's so pretty! Come here, Matsuno. I'll dress you. It suits you. Madam, we dressed her up. - She looks so pretty now. - What? Madam, we're ready. Come now. Look at her, Madam. - She's really pretty. - You did a good job. - Looks just like a doll. - That's right. Hurray, Sakuji Nishida! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! - Good evening. - Good evening. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Thank you. - Thank you. Congratulations! Please have one. It's very hot, isn't it? - Let me pour you one. - Ah, thank you. I'll pour one for you. Hold this for a moment. - Here you go. - Thanks. What's wrong, Matsuno? Are you crying? Seeing how there are people who get such grand send offs, it reminded me of my brother who went on his own and made me cry. - Have some more. - Let me pour you one. - Hey. - Oh, I'm sorry. Here you go. This hot spring was discovered by a crow. - A crow? - That's right. A long time ago, a distinguished monk climbed Mount Hakusan in Kaga. On his way back, he found many injured crows next to a pond. So, when he went closer, he found that the water was very, very hot. And that's how they found out about the hot spring? Right, and because of that, crows are treated as important guardian deities here. So, you could say we're taking a crow bath? That's right! - One more time. - Alright, here we go! - Today's not my day at all. - Yeah, same here. - What's the matter? - What's wrong? - Hey, you're next. - All right, let's go! - One more! - It's no good. Madam, I have a favour to ask. What is it? I got a letter from my mother, and I was wondering if you could do something. Again with this? What's wrong now? Dad's neuralgia has gotten so bad that he can't move anymore. The doctor said he must be hospitalised. Now, that's quite a problem. Madam, can you help me out here? Well, you see... I really want to lend you some money, but I borrowed you 20 yen just the other day. Let me see... Your earnings for this month come to 80 yen. Out of that, 25 yen goes to the house. Then, food expenses are 17 yen, room and board are 10 yen, and the rental price for two costumes 11 yen. The tall wooden clogs come to 7 yen 50 sen. On top of that, I gave you a 5 yen allowance. And then, if we take away the 20 yen I gave you the other day, you are 15 yen in the red. Since it's you, Matsuno, I might lend you 5 or 10 yen, but I wonder how much will it take to admit him to a hospital. Unlike the others, you don't have to do some stuff like dress extravagantly, or satisfy lascivious customers. Everyone sends money home. I wish I could do something, but... Yes, this is Satomi. Yes, Ms. Shogetsu. Yes. Yes, thank you for your continued patronage. Matsuno, they asked for you by name at the Shogetsu inn. - They asked for me? - Right. - Who could it be? - "Send her over right away", they said. - Hurry up, get ready. - Alright. Good evening. Ah, Mr. Kosugi! When did you arrive? Yesterday. I have a favour to ask you. I brought a customer with me. Good evening and thank you! Hey. This man is Kunogawa. He's the head clerk of a Kanazawa canned food wholesaler, where I get my goods from. - Hi. - I'm indebted to him. When I told him about you, he kept saying: "You must let me meet that girl". That's why I brought you over today. You don't mind, do you? Staying here for a while. I don't mind, I'm not going anywhere. I'll stay until you ask me to leave. I hear you used to work in Wajima. Yes, I was in Kan'onmachi. Ah, that's a cold place. I used to visit there often, but it was such a cold, lonely place. Yes, it's a cold town. Still, I was so worried when I came to Yamashiro. I didn't know what to do. But I'm glad I came. It's all thanks for Mr. Kosugi. This guy's got connections. Here you go. You've already gotten used to being a hostess. Yes, thanks to you. You're getting more and more beautiful. Youth is so resilient. Mr. Kunogawa, she's good, isn't she? Yes, she is. My... You flatter me. You said you had something to tell me. What is it? Please tell me. Well... right. You're being so weird, come out and say it! Ah, Mr. Kunogawa will be in the Bamboo Room next door. Come. To tell you the truth... There's something I'd like to ask you. I'd really like you to do this for me. But since I thought it wouldn't do to disrespect your will on this, I decided to ask you first. What is it? Spill it out. Alright. I told Kunokawa about you. And about how you're an admirable girl. These days, finding someone sending money to their parents, and taking care of them is pretty rare. I can help you out a bit, if you want. Let me put it this way. That man... Let's just say he's very influential. He's someone I owe a lot to. He's a kind, respectable man, with a gentle heart. Matsuno. Will you heed my request if it's alright with you? What is it? If you keep working here as a hostess, I believe a day will come when you're coerced by the Madam of Satomi to give yourself to an unpleasant customer. That being the case, why not do that for my friend and benefactor instead? That's why I brought you here today. Don't be afraid, Matsuno. If you think about it, it's kind of like marrying for money. Kunokawa is a rich man, always working. So, he never lets any girl come near him, but, even so, he's still a man. When he heard about a sweet, pretty girl like you struggling, he felt he couldn't just let it be. He said "If she's okay with it, I'll take care of her for the rest of my life", and came all the way here to ask you, despite his busy schedule. If I accept his request, will it help you, too? It might, yes. He helps me out with my business. If you accept his request... I guess my business with him might improve. Anyway, no need to think about me. Kunokawa seems madly in love with you. If you're willing to give yourself to him, then there's no harm in that. However, you have to take as much as you can. I think you should go for 100 yen. 100 yen! Can I really get 100 yen? Will you take the offer? What do you say, then? Hold on a second, please. I don't know what I should say. I feel like I'm forgetting something. I can see Ritsuko's face flickering before me. It feels like... Like she's staring at me intently. Matsuno! Where are you going? Did she leave? It's not really like that. It's her first time, so I think she went to make up her mind. She'll come back for sure! Look here... You can see she left her bag. Please have patience and look forward to seeing her again. Is that so? Who knows where Ritsuko is at this hour. She's out at a party somewhere, carousing with a customer. You're back? Mr. Kosugi... Do I really get 100 yen? You'll get it. And it'll really be of help to you, too? It will. In that case, I humbly accept. You've never slept with a man before, right? Never. Is that so? You've been so kind to me until now, and I've always liked you, Mr. Kosugi. I wouldn't mind sleeping with you at all. But I need that 100 yen. I want the 100 yen to send my father to hospital no matter what. So, just like you intended, I'll do what that man asks. But please don't tell this to anyone. Keep it from Ritsuko, too. You too, pretend like you don't know anything. I don't want you to be here for this. Go somewhere out of sight. Is that you, Matsuno? Come on over. Come on, honey. Come, come now. I'm scared, mister. There's nothing to be afraid of, Matsuno. Nothing to be afraid of. It's something every girl does when she grows up. You just have to lay still and bear with me. I'm scared. I'm scared, mister. Don't kill me. Don't kill me, please. Mom! Mr. Kosugi... thank you. Thank you, Mr. Kosugi. Thank you, Mr. Kosugi. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Kosugi. Thank you, Mr. Kosugi. Thank you. Mr. Kosugi… You idiot! Ritsuko, forgive me. So, it's true? I met the housekeeper from the Shogetsu inn, and she said you took a customer there. Did you really sleep with a man? I thought about talking it over with you first, but I decided to follow his advice in the end. Whose? Tell me. Don't be mad. It's someone you know. I know him? Stop messing around and tell me already! It's Mr. Kosugi. You slept with him? No, it was his acquaintance. An older man named Kunokawa. Did you fall in love with that old man? No, I wanted the money. Matsuno! Look, I know it's your own body... You can do whatever you want with it, and I won't say anything. But, no matter how much you wanted money, you should have waited a bit longer. You're still 19! It hasn't been that long since you entered Satomi. And you go and do a thing like that. Does your Madam know? Was she the one that sent you? She doesn't know anything. Oh, to hell with it! So, how much did you get? Kosugi gave me 100 yen. 100 yen! That's chicken feed! It was your first time, right? First time sleeping with a man? Then, you shouldn't be so grateful for a mere 100 yen. He must have taken a lot of money from the customer, and then, swiped most of it. You idiot! You were cheated! So, is he still staying at the Shogetsu inn? He said he'll be here for a few more days. Alright. I'll go see him and get more money from him. Let me see him try his sweet talk while I'm giving him the works! Matsuno, you don't owe that man a thing! When he took you to Satomi, he received a reward. And now he's trying to pocket the money for your defloration. He's making money by passing your body around. You can't just keep quiet. I'll go meet Kosugi and get more money off him. It's still not much, but we have to get at least 200 yen. Otherwise, you'll be left hanging. Come, let's go together. Matsuno, I'll go talk to him alone. If you were with me, you'd just accept everything meekly. Why don't you wait at this shrine? I'll be right back, okay? Don't go anywhere and wait for me. Making fools of us! He's already gone. They told me he left early this morning. The cheat! That man's pretty sly, Matsuno. Right now he must be in some hot spring resort, having a grand old time. I know this might make you angry, but I don't think he's that bad of a person. You idiot! How much benefit of the doubt are you willing to give him? He was selling your own body, without you even realising it... Yes, but he did pay out the 100 yen as agreed. I already told you, that's a pittance. Selling your body for 100 yen, unbelievable! Yes, but... Anyway, what's done is done. No use crying about it. You'll have to be careful next time. Men are always on the prowl. You sold your precious body without any regret... You're nonchalant about it. But if you end up like me, you'll be done for. One person like me in this world is already more than enough. I wanted to watch over you, so that you wouldn't end up like me. I'm sorry, Ritsuko. I needed the money. Kosugi told me he'd give me 100 yen, so I suddenly made up my mind. Ritsuko, I sent 90 yen to my parents this morning, and also a gift packet to my brother. The money should arrive home soon. When I just imagine how happy my mom and dad will be when they see it, it makes it all worth it. When I look at it that way, I don't really have a grudge against Kosugi. He helped me out. Matsuno! When I see you not feeling the least bit bitter towards Kosugi, even feeling indebted to him, saying he "helped you out", I can't help but feel sorry for you. I can't help it! Keep pace! - Shall we go to the Oyama shrine? - Sure, you want to pray for something? - The castle is so pretty. - Yeah, it really is. Matsuno! Hurry up! We don't really get to go to a place like Kanazawa too often. I think I might go see a movie before going home. Really? I have someone here I want to visit. I'll meet you at the station later. - See you, then. - Bye. Mr. Kosugi, you have a visitor. Who is it? Oh... It's Matsuno from Yamashiro! I'm here. Can I come up? Yes, come on in. I'm glad you came. You don't come often to Kanazawa. - Come on in, then. - Alright. You did good finding this place. I thought you'd be at the office at this time of day, so I tried there. I met Mr. Kunokawa. What did that geezer tell you? That Kosugi hasn't shown his face for four or five days now. What do you say? How about having lunch with me? I'm not hungry, so if you'll excuse me. I see. It's okay, then. One of these days, I'll go visit you in Yamashiro again. My relationship with the old man has turned sour. I haven't been to the office for about a week now. I read the letter you sent me. You wrote that you regretted introducing me to Mr. Kunokawa. When I read that letter, I realised right away what a good person you are. And, so, I suddenly wanted to see you. I'm just that kind of woman, I guess. I received a lot of money from that man and sent it to the country, and I'm truly grateful for that. I just wanted to come and tell you that. I'm bad at writing letters. Say, Matsuno. There's something I'd like to ask you. Was Kunogawa really your first? It was really my first time. I was scolded by Ritsuko about what I did that night. She was furious. Of course. It's reasonable she'd be angry. I did something really stupid. I'm glad... It makes me happy to hear you feel this way. But it's really not a big deal for me. It really made me happy. Oh, it's raining. It's just a shower. It'll go away soon. Matsuno. Kunokawa had me at a disadvantage, so I had an obligation to be of service to him. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'd like to lay it all bare one of these days. I think then you'll be able to understand. But I can't tell you now. I don't know what it could be, but you saying that you can't tell me worries me. Are you in some kind of trouble? Are you in trouble? Something like that. But I can't tell you about it right now. You'll understand later. You'll understand later, just don't ask me about it today. I won't if you say so. I only came here to give you my thanks, and to let you know that you shouldn't worry about it, like you wrote in the letter. But… But what? What's the matter? Don't ever meet with Kunokawa again, Matsuno. He might be mad about you, but he's not the one that truly cherishes you. You're not the kind of girl that he can toy with as he pleases. I know this is strange coming from me, after what I did, but you have to take care of yourself. I regret what I've done. I regret introducing you to Kunokawa. Don't ever sleep with a client again! Matsuno! Take good care of yourself and keep working. You have a pure heart. Your soul is virginal. Please, Matsuno... Don't let my introducing you to Kunokawa lead you to a rough way of life. I beg you, Matsuno. I'm so happy now, Mr. Kosugi. I'm so happy... Ah... It's so beautiful! Matsuno, go away. I'm a bad man. Leave now! Don't tell me anything, don't ask me anything... Just leave. I'm a bad man. Excuse me. You have a girl here named Matsuno Niki? Yes, she lives here. I need to see her, can you call her down please? Here's my card. Matsuno, this man just came. M.P.,that's like a police for soldiers, right? Do you have any idea what's this about? Maybe they came about my brother? - Come on down with me. - Alright. What's going on? I think her brother might have died in the war. - No! - No way... Did you go to Kanazawa 4 or 5 days ago? Yes, I went shopping with Kikuno. So, you were there to do some shopping? Yes. So, was it shopping that brought you to North Japan Foods? No, I went to visit someone. Who was it? Mr. Kosugi. By Kosugi, you mean Inasuke Kosugi? - Yes. - And was he there, Kosugi? No, only Mr. Kunokawa. Kunokawa is that fat manager, right? Yes. Where did you go after meeting Kunokawa? I went to Mr. Kosugi's place. You met at a house in Saiwaicho? Yes, Mr. Kosugi was away from work that day. - It was on the second floor, right? - Yes. But I left his place after about 30 minutes. I met with Kikuno at the appointed time. What did you talk about during those 30 minutes? What's the matter? If you won't be honest with me, we might have a problem. If you don't cooperate with our investigation, we'll arrest you, Matsuno, even though you're a minor. We didn't talk about anything special. Just when I thought about leaving, we had a sudden shower, so I waited it out there. The rain stopped soon, and gave way to a beautiful sunset, so I set off for the station right away. - That's all? - Yes. Did he tell you anything while it was raining? No, he didn't tell me anything. Did something happen to him? That's right. Something did happen. We're tracking Kosugi on a matter of some importance, but he disappeared right after meeting with you. What's this important thing? It's a serious matter. I can't tell you now. He's a dishonest man, that one. Poor Matsuno... He used her and played with her feelings. She lost her virginity to Kunogawa, and I'm sure Kosugi took a cut for making it happen. After Matsuno told me of this, I went straight away to Shogetsu inn, but both of them were already gone. A swindler! In the end, she became damaged goods. - Damaged goods? - That's right! She was a steady, honest girl... I knew her well from when I was in Wajima. She's not the kind of girl who'd follow Kosugi around. It's because she truly believes in people that he managed to trick her into entering Satomi with kind words, so she ended up suffering in the end. Kosugi was working as a canned goods salesman, but I'm sure he was also in the business of selling young girls. He's the most despicable man. Catch that bastard as soon as you can! Lock him up! If we believe everything Ritsuko told us, we know the connection between him, Matsuno and Kunokawa. But that still doesn't give us a single clue on where Kosugi is hiding. That Kunogawa guy is no good. You think he'll really cooperate with us? I think he intends to. He knew Kosugi was a deserter and still protected him. In return, he got Matsuno. Maybe he realised his position would be in jeopardy if he tried to hide anything from us. But there're so many louts in this world. A man sells a woman, and takes off with the money he got for her deflowering. And then, the man who buys that woman snitches on him. The only person to feel sorry for here is the woman, isn't it? That's right. And we're going to sacrifice that pitiable woman. I just thought of something clever. By sacrificing that poor woman, we'll open up a new method of investigation. How about this, Mr. Kamoshita? You go back to Kanazawa right now and call a journalist. Then, we can use them to make our search for Kosugi public under the guise of chasing a vicious human trader. I see... You're right! The reason I've been up and running around for a year without being able to capture the deserter Kazuo Saegusa is because we didn't announce his desertion for fear of harming the public's morale. So, we decided on a secret investigation. Fortunately, we discovered Kosugi's other crimes here. He's a criminal. He's a human trafficker in violation of the Employment Security Act. In other words, Kosugi is a low-life now. We'll fess up about him being a deserter to the police after he is arrested. At this stage, we must only accuse him of being a human trafficker. Go to Kanazawa, request a new arrest warrant, and have it published in a newspaper. But if we do that, what about the girl? All she wanted was to earn some money, and kept the details a secret even from her father, so going public with this will certainly threaten her livelihood. Can't be helped. It's for the good of the nation. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Kosugi Inasuke, a resident of 56 Susumu Terai, Saiwaicho, On the suspicion of human trafficking and violation of the Employment Security Act. This is because he lured or forced dozens of girls to work for him and service his customers, while he made a profit. This includes Matsuno Niki, from the geisha house of Satomi in the hot spring resort of Yamashiro. You sold your virginity without telling me a thing. What a thing to do! What will you do if they shut us down? (Human trafficking) Dozens of young girls already fallen prey to his lust for profits. We don't have anything to do with Mr. Kosugi. You got me in a lot of trouble by associating with a no good man like him. I had nothing to do with it! I never asked you to give up your virginity for 100 yen, nor do I remember receiving any compensation for it. What the hell were you thinking? You need to pack up and leave right this minute. You're wrong, Madam. There must be some mistake. He is not a bad man. The newspaper articles are all lies! I don't want to hear it! Anyhow, just get out and leave already! I'm afraid they'll shut us down. I don't want people to talk behind my back. Go away, right now! None of my business if Kosugi is good or bad, I don't care. Matsuno? I'm back. You must be surpised. I decided to take a short trip home, while I was in Kanazawa. You aren't an apparition? It's really Matsuno. You grew to be so beautiful. If you sent me a postcard, I would have gone out to meet you. I'm glad to see you better, dad. Thanks to the money you sent us, I was able to get in a hospital in Udetsu. Dr. Saito, a neurologist, was kind enough to examine me. He said "EMS therapy will cure you". Every day, they'd extend cords from this big machine, and treat me with electric currents coming from it. And then, I quickly started to feel better. I got back on my feet. You were so kind to us. Thanks to you, I was able to spend 7 days there, and now I'm completely cured. You sent us a lot of money. It's all thanks to you. You really saved us. Oh, that's right! I don't know what it is, but we got a letter without a sender. I thought it was strange they didn't send it to Yamashiro. I put it in the drawer of the Buddhist altar, thinking I'd send it back tomorrow. Open it and see. It's Kosugi! Dad, I've got an emergency. I'll be right back tomorrow, please wait for me. I have to go now because I have very urgent business to attend to. Do you have money, dad? We have 30 yen left over from the hospital bills, we're keeping it safe. Can I borrow a little? It's your money. Take it. I'm sorry, please lend me 10 yen. I was thinking of sending this letter to Yamashiro. But, for some reason, I decided to send it to your hometown. Since you're in Yamashiro, you might not read this before the Bon festival, or New Year's, or maybe when you go back home for good. But that's fine with me. I'm writing this to you because I want to make you understand. I only want you to see the whole truth. Right now, I'm in a port called Fukuura, near Notokongo. I really think I wronged you most of all. But... Please forgive me. To tell you the truth, no good man that I am, I couldn't take being in the Fukuchiyama regiment anymore, and so I deserted last summer. I escaped the barracks with one other friend... Up until now, I've managed to evade capture, but when I came to Kanazawa, I got in trouble when Kunogawa got wind of my background. I was afraid he might talk, so I spent a whole painful year bowing down to him, and doing as I was told. No matter how menial it was. I also introduced you to Kunogawa because I was afraid of my identity being exposed. All those things I did to you were because I wanted to hide my old sins. Please, forgive me. It's now been 5 days since I escaped from Kanazawa. The crime of deserting the Army is a serious one. A disgrace for a Japanese man. I'm traitor to my country. They say I'm facing an execution. I'll be running away until the very end, but now I started feeling like dying would be easier than returning to the dreaded Army. Matsuno... Please work hard, and take good care of your mother and father. And take good care of yourself. Excuse me... Is there a man named Kosugi staying here? No, there's no one named Kosugi here. Maybe he's under a different name. Is there a man staying here on his own? There are 3 men staying at my place, but they're all together. They're all in the fishing industry. Are there any other inns? Yes, there is one in the fishing village over there. In that case, I'll go and check there. Thank you. It's alright. I'm from the police. What did that woman ask you just now? Hello, is this the Togi police? I'm Kamoshita from the Kanazawa police station. I called you before. Is Second Lieutenant Inumata of the Military Police there? Yeah, I said I called you about this earlier. Yes, sir. Right... He still hasn't arrived. Oh, there he is now! Phone call for you. Thank you for contacting me. I just got here. Yes? Is that so? Alright, understood. How many minutes does it take to get to Fukuura? About 30 minutes. Alright, I'm getting there by car. Keep an eye on them for 30 minutes. Mr. Kosugi... I want you to stay alive somewhere, without falling into despair. I came all the way here to encourage you and cheer you up. I'm a deserter. I ran away from the Army because I hated the thought of going to war. Matsuno... Please leave a guy like me alone. Don't come any closer, I'll only make you unhappy. I don't want to do that! I love you! I don't want you to go somewhere where I can't find you. I hate the thought of not being able to see you. Mr. Kosugi... - Mr. Kosugi. - Matsuno. Just run away, please. Find a way to escape somehow. I don't care where, I just want you to live. If you think you'll be lonely on your own... If you wouldn't mind... I'd like to go with you as well. I'll go out and buy some cigarettes. Golden Bat, please. - All of them, please. - All of them? There are 7. Come! Come here. The man you're meeting at the inn right now is Inasuke Kosugi, who's been making the headlines these days, you know that? There's no more need for you to see that man. He deserted from the army. He committed a shameful sin. If you stick with him now, the Military Police will arrest you, too, on the grounds that you were his accomplice. - She's running away! - Stop! Let me go! Let me see him! Let me go! Be quiet! Let me go! Shut up! Shut your mouth already! Everyone makes mistakes! Every person in the world... We all make mistakes! Shut it already! Ritsuko said he was no good. Madam at the Satomi also said he was no good. And now you're trying to capture him. If he wasn't there back then, I wouldn't have been able to help my sick father get better. Who else was there other than him when I needed help? To me, he's a kind, honest man. I cherish him dearly.
