Films are my hobby, my hobby is my profession, my profession is my life, my life is a film in Technicolor and CinemaScope. THE LAST MOVIE PAINTER Casaro is the world's greatest hyperrealist film poster painter. He's almost better known in the United States than in Italy. It's all thanks to Casaro that we're now able to use photography as a means of communication in posters. Let's say that the world of poster design ended with Casaro. He wasn't someone who only worked on commission, someone who worked for money. The most important thing for him was inspiration. He was an illustrator for countless Italian and international films. I'll never forget him, not only because of his kind and gentle nature, but also because of his extraordinary talent. They were perfect from the point of view of a great painter, but at the same time he also added some humour, some things that perhaps weren't in the film. They were so different from everything else at the time that they generated a lot of interest. His work has always been very obsessive. Everything has to be perfect — the lines, the features, the colours, the details! Casaro is an interesting figure. Although he's quiet, he's full of ideas, of a thousand different things. He had a great reputation, so when the distributor wanted something done well, something worthwhile, they would turn to Casaro. His work conveys a sense of movement. The images are never still but always moving. His characters come to life. For me, Casaro is cinema. Most of my memories of the first films I watched as a spectator, are inextricably linked to his imagery, his artistic touch. Obviously, in my opinion this made and still makes him the greatest ever illustrator in the history of Italian cinema. Painting has always been my passion. I was born with a pencil in my hand. Even as a very young child I was always drawing animals, people school friends. I used to do caricatures. I used to daub no matter what. Then I fell in love with cinema and its posters. When I was 15, I worked as an apprentice at a printing works in Treviso. It was there I learned the basics of advertising and printing techniques. It was a great school to start and work my way up. At the time we still worked on stone and zinc sheets. I was then lucky enough to get a job at the Garibaldi cinema, which was one of the most important cinemas in Treviso. I worked there in the evenings after the printing works and I produced these big prints for them, announcing the next release. I remember working on films like “Latin Lovers” with Lara Turner and “Apache” with Burt Lancaster. My friends used to turn up in the evenings and I let them in through the back door so that we could watch the films together without paying. I was just 18 years old, back in 1953. Clearly Rome and Cinecitta were my dream, and... gripped by enthusiasm, I set off for Rome full of hope. At the time it was a bit like going to America, it was an incredible journey if you think of the distance, with my parents crying “why Rome?” My father worked at the Breda shipyard and dreamed that I would become a ship designer, because he thought that getting into the design department was a great thing. I was therefore a bit of a disappointment, but he still helped me out in the end, because for the first few months I was supported by my family, as you might expect, then I paid them back in full. Their bet paid off. Upon arriving in Rome, I immediately visited all the most important production companies. And I have to say that generally speaking they were all very helpful, they all gave me advice. However, the most important contact I made was at the Studio Favalli. This was very fortunate, because Favalli worked for Lux Film, so he got me to do a test and that marked the start of my adventure in Rome. The Studio Favalli was a source of knowledge and also enrichment, because Renato Fratini was also there, another great painter in the history of film. I was able to learn lots of secrets linked to tempera, how to use brushes. Obviously I was just a helper. I didn't create posters, but I helped out a lot and had a great relationship with Frattini, so I learned a great deal. A few years later I had to leave the studio to do military service. Favalli wrote me a letter of recommendation to present myself to the major American and Italian production companies The letter worked well, because during my military service they took me on at II Vittorioso headquarters to draw comic strips. It wasn't what I aspired to, but I still enjoyed it. I did a couple of stories, particularly a Western in which the cinematographic structure of the scenes is apparent. After military service I immediately started work for Mander Film, a Russian company that distributed intellectual films to art-house cinemas, where they would be watched by Communist circles. I was very fortunate in this case too, because I was able to start actually creating posters for some minor films. This gave me the opportunity to express myself, learn and work my way up. My first major film to be screened on the national circuit was “Two Blue Eyes.” I'd say that for this work, I drew a lot of inspiration from the poster designer Brini. Strangely, I started out with a German film, with a German actress, and I ended with a German film and a German wife. My mother was a real Francophile and always called me Rene when I was a boy, so I signed my posters Rene. That continued until one day a producer called Edmondo Amati said: “This sounds like a hairdresser's name. You should drop it.” So I stopped using Rene and signed myself Casaro instead. It was a way of making myself sound more important, as if I was from France, who knows what I was thinking. The post-war period in Italy was also a time of great revival in the film industry, going beyond Neorealism. Countless American films were made in Italy and Cinecitta became a sort of branch of Hollywood. This led to the fascinating phenomenon of the so-called Hollywood on the Tiber. Lots of American films were made in Italy. Rome itself, which was a city still tied to its past, still a big village at the time, went on to become something else. It became a metropolis with strong links to the cinema and to these American stars who flew into Ciampino. The so-called Dolce Vita was born as portrayed by Fellini in the film of the same name in 1960, although it had already existed for a few years: Via Veneto, actresses, young girls trying to make their way in this world, and everyone revolving around films in Rome. So we had the bit players who work at Cinecitta, the camera operators, many screenwriters, actors, directors at the start of their careers. It was a very busy period for poster designers too. Alongside the rebirth and renaissance of Italian cinema through Fellini, Monicelli, Lattuada, Antonioni, Visconti, etc., a particular film genre with Bava, with Sergio Leone, started to make inroads and really took off in the 1960s, being exported all over the world. The Italian film industry became the second biggest in the world in terms of quantity. Italy made around 380 films per year. Rome was the greatest place to be at the time. There was such a creative atmosphere. It was a place of cinema within cinema, with an air that inspired you, because we were on the edge of it all, or I was at least. I was trying to live, because I was young, 20, 22. I remember I had a friend who owned a body shop and so he had access to cars. Having a car was important at the time, you could use it to pick up girls — not like today. And so by night we went out on the town with these cars, we went to the famous Meo Patacca restaurant in Rome, where all the foreigners ate their dinner, and we were outside trying to pick up girls, trying to live the good life. My friend was Mister Dollar, because he was a real spendthrift. Then, clearly, I had to open a studio. I needed to have control over the entire production cycle. There were three of us. I developed the idea and painted. Another one did the cutting, the copy and the layout. The third did the photomontage for the flongs and the lobby cards. It was a full cycle. Casaro entered this story at the end of the most dynamic period film posters had ever known. They were everywhere, fly posting bans did not apply. The cinema made us dream, but it also made us learn and taught us about the world. We were an illiterate people, captured by images rather than words, and so this was one of the roles fulfilled by the poster. It formed part of a collective imagination that was being transformed and entering the modern era. Casaro began with an impressionistic style, a style that was still very sketchy, rapid and fast due to the way he worked at the time and also to the fact that poster designers had to work to very tight deadlines. The major production companies such as Metro, Fox and Warner worked with great illustrators and quite rightly had a monopoly. You couldn't enter it, so I covered a less important market. Ultimately, this proved useful because it gave me the opportunity to work a lot and really practise. I was able to study, experiment and make mistakes. What's more, I was not under the control of an art director. I was responsible for deciding what to do. I was free! My breakthrough came when Dino De Laurentiis called me up for my first big-budget film, “The Bible”, produced in Italy, which was already something extraordinary in itself, using cutting-edge technology that was unheard-of at the time for a film of this kind. It's was incredible! There were designers, architects, everything. De Laurentiis had his studios on Via Pontina, where there was some wasteland. He had the Tower of Babel and Noah's Ark built there. It was an amazing sight, because Noah's ark was life-size. It was enormous, like a house, like Noah's Ark must have been, and all made by hand with real wood. The Tower of Babel was gigantic. It's not like today when everything can be created using digital technology. At the time it was all realistic, a truly monumental endeavour. There was also a permanent zoo for all the animals, which John Huston would then use in that classic scene of loading the animals onto the ark. My father was someone who really loved painting, he asked two great Italian painters to help with the scenery for “The Bible.” One was Corrado Cagli and the other was his brother-in-law Afro. Once I went into a warehouse and counted 1200 paintings. And I have to say that Renato, as a good painter and an admirer of other people's painting, evidently took the two most important concepts to heart: Noah's Ark and the Tower of Babel. With these two elements, I'll reminded the public exactly what the Bible is about in an exemplary, direct and concise manner. And I have to say that the Tower of Babel really reflects the paintings by both Afro and Corrado Cagli. Like any intelligent person, he never rejected any advice, any suggestions or any work by other people. Look, these are the repertoire photos that I guard jealously because they are the basis for my work. In the world of film you have to know how to do everything, not just people's faces, but also animals, horses, lions. I use this material to inspire me and do accurate drawings. For example... in Westerns... In Westerns you can... if I need to draw a hand holding a pistol, I can see the way it is held in this photo... just as if I need to draw a Native American on horseback I can look at this. If the film is set in the Middle Ages... here I can study armour, the horses with arm ours, decorations, coats of arms. Drawings have to be accurate. You can't just invent things! Even in horror films, if you need a woman screaming here is one. This is all very important material, fundamental for someone who has to paint, who has to know how to do everything! The 1970s were the years when his style became realistic, which doesn't mean he abandoned the sketchy and impressionistic style of the past, but that there was a development that led to greater realism and this benefitted an entire series of important actors who dominated Italian comedy during the period. “My Friends” is very interesting because it was one of the first examples of a mixture of photography and the painterly dimension in Casaro's work. He had this extraordinary, revolutionary idea of imagining this box with these springs coming out of it to simulate a joke and a Jack-in-a-box, featuring the faces of the great cast cut out from photographs. This was the first example of a very interesting experiment. Strangely “My Friends” got off to a very bad start and didn't bring in much money. We were shocked because we'd prepared it really well. So why didn't people come to the cinema? What did we do wrong? We felt responsible for the bad communication. However, both Rizzoli and the commercial office said: “'No, we've done everything perfectly and we won't change anything.” And every evening Rizzoli made up for the shortfall at the cinema to keep the program me running. I find this really amazing. It means really believing in something, and suddenly the public started going to see the film, so that in the end, “My Friends” became one of Italy's biggest box office hits. The film took off around 16—17 days after its release. Today it would be scrapped after 3 days! Censorship at the time was extremely severe. Films rated as unsuitable for anyone under 18 are now considered films suitable for everyone. It was incredible. We were afraid of being put on trial, of being accused. For example, we weren't reported for “Oh, Serafina!”, but we were a bit concerned, so much so that Renato said to me: “Shall we do it?” And I answered yes. If a magistrate wanted to use his imagination he could interpret it in a pornographic way. It was a bit provocative, but that didn't mean it was a pornographic film. That was the only risk, a risk that in a certain sense also meant that cinema owners might say: "This is a film that could create some trouble for us. Let's shelve it!” And that could have harmed us financially. I always tried to create something beautiful and stylish, never something vulgar. But I deliberately never went beyond it so as to avoid censorship. One example is “ll Corpo delta Ragazza,” which was a very successful film. There's an erotic touch, but it's very refined so that it's impossible to censor it. In fact, it's so beautiful, so delicate that there was no problem at all. I laughed out loud and he said: “Why are you laughing?” “I'm laughing because it's like you've quenched someone's thirst with ham. It's quite an embarrassing situation. How will people react when they see it?” And he replied: “Look, I don't think there's anything vulgar about it, firstly because it's all there: Brera's novel. Secondly: my image is like an evanescent apparition of a piece of the girl's body, and I place a lot of significance on that rose.” And so what happened? We procured an exhibition space on a building undergoing restoration on Via Larga in Milan, so that when you went down this street in Milan you saw this huge poster with this wonderful bottom and this rose perched on top of it. The 1970s were golden years for cinema, precisely because it was experiencing a crisis due to the advent of television and changes among the audience, leaving directors free to be more inventive. The 1970s brought an explosion of genres to the big screen, such as had never been seen before: horror, sci-fi, comedy in all its forms, erotica pioneered by the “Decameron,” but also by Lino Banfi and the Pierino films. Casaro interpreted this development and, in doing so, lived up to the standards of the great international graphic artists. Anything went at the time! And some of his images have remained impressed upon the collective imagination. Working with Cineriz once again, we made “An Average Little Man.” We'd initially thought of casting Ugo Tognazzi, but then we fell in love with the idea of Alberto Sordi because we said to ourselves it's such a ferocious story that if we have an actor who's not so representative of the average Italian it could be rejected, but no one would reject Sordi. And I have to say that Renato Casaro did an extraordinary job interpreting the two parts of the film: the first part, with a helpful Sordi, a Sordi who is working as a civil servant. Then after this he also constructed an image of the second part of the film in which Sordi is terrified by what has happened to him. So there was this face filled with bewilderment, meaning that the campaign could make use of both these two images. People must have been intrigued to see a new Alberto Sordi, an Alberto Sordi they'd never seen before. And those shadows behind him, what are they doing? Why are they there? The more questions you ask the public, the more curious they become, and the more you drive them to the cinema. Perhaps we were lucky. I'm very happy to have been lucky with Renato Casaro. An Italian actor asked Sergio Leone why he used American instead of Italian actors for his westerns. He replied: “Because the Americans' gaze is projected into the future, into the great expanses, the great plains, while Italians are short-sighted and so I prefer Americans.” Sergio Leone was a very practical man. He knew what he wanted and it was very easy to work with him. He gave you plenty of inspiration, plenty of ideas. In fact, when we produced the advert for “My Name Is Nobody,” Sergio Leone had the idea of creating two posters. The one from behind had to come out first, with no title, nothing. People just had to see this reclining figure. They could tell it was Terence Hill, but they didn't know what film it was. Two weeks later, that poster was replaced by a second version, with the actor in the same position but seen from the front, with all the credits, the cast, the title, etc... It was an exceptional advertising campaign and it was all his idea. We worked on those positions with Sergio Leone in his villa in Rome, creating these images with the photographer so that they could be used in the posters. Leone loved showing me the posters that Renato Casaro made for him. He used to point things out with his finger: “How well he's done that pistol! That Colt! Look at that grip, look how he's done it! Look at the sweat dripping down here! He has a fine hand!” He boasted that he was his... his... his... his poster painter. In fact, Renato always focused heavily on the details, especially for Leone's films. He built a great relationship with some of these actors, particularly Terence Hill, going on set to take photographs to help him get a better idea of how to depict the character on the poster. These study and creative phases are fundamental, really characterising Casaro's style. This was not particularly common practice. He actually chose to go on set to help him decide what to do and how to produce the best possible poster. There was an important scene they wanted to film for the “Trinity” series, so the producer said: “create this scene for me and then we'll film it.” So I created it on the basis of the screenplay, reading what it was supposed to be like. I did the sketch and then they filmed the scene. I would have preferred to do it after they filmed the scene, because it was really difficult to imagine it, but in the end it was a big success. They were so different from everything else at the time that they generated a lot of interest. Back then, posters usually featured a close-up image of the faces of actors such as Clint Eastwood, Franco Nero and Giuliano Gemma. But here the main character is sleeping and so some said: “That's not right, we need to see his face!” In this case, I insisted that we shouldn't see it. I agreed with Renato, because it was something brand new. It was time for a change. You can't see the main character and so your curiosity is aroused: 'Who could it be?” The fact that we only see half a horse is also highly original. It's great fun. They were perfect from the point of view of a great painter, but at the same time... he also added some humour, some things that perhaps weren't in the film. He had captured our personalities. The affability he conveys through his posters is unique, because he was the best and, what's more, I think he really loved creating them. I remember Renato as being very enthusiastic, smiley, wanting to make something beautiful. He never pulled back. It was a very fortunate union of people who wanted to do things really well. The producer, Alabiso, said to me: “I'll only need a poster by Casaro for the next film! I'll take it all over Europe and sell the film before I've even made it.” If it hadn't been for Casaro we might not have enjoyed such great success. We're still cataloguing so much material. After our most recent moves we found some big boxes with more sketches inside. I don't know whether it's a virtue or a defect, but I've always kept my sketches. It was a hang-up of mine. I don't know why, but instead of throwing them away I always kept them. I never imagined they might be important, but luckily we now have all this material available. At the moment I'm trying to sort out this huge archive. I need to go through it and find what I need for the exhibition or book we're planning. For example, this is “Cotton Club.” It's a real classic. You can see that I created this detail of the sub-machine gun where its shadow becomes a trumpet, because this is a film about music and gangsters. Ah, look... “Quincy Jones,” a film about Quincy Jones. This sketch was designed in the 1980s. It's very modern, with a very effective look that would be pure graphics today. This is a classic. The first Rambo, no Rambo II. “Total recall”. “Total recall” with Schwarzenegger. I worked on lots of films starring Schwarzenegger. This one was the final version. “Terminator”. This hole bursting through the steel in the final version worked really well because you can see how he has broken through a very thick wall. This conveys his strength, his superhuman strength. I've got two sketches for “The Name of the Rose.” This must have created a big dilemma for whoever had to pick the image. Another one was chosen in the end, but this one would have worked really well. This arch shape, seen from below, which highlights these characters, each one with his own story and mysteries. I think this black void here... is truly exceptional. But I created a dilemma for the person who had to choose. I did this one for America, and then it was imported to Italy too. “The Blue Angel.” I did this one for France. Ah! Here we have “Cliffhanger.” I did various sketches for this. They're not all here because everything's all mixed up and there are lots of them. I'm still cataloguing them. There are three versions. I left this one unfinished because I wasn't very happy with it. The dynamics weren't what I wanted, the colours were a bit dull. In short, it didn't really inspire me, so I stopped working on it. This is another more concise and more detailed version. Here we have the steel wire, which shows how much strength must have been needed to hold on. Here is the hand... It might not be very descriptive, but it's a very effective image. Ah, here! “Sparrow.” This also brings back memories, reminding me of relationships that could be difficult at time. It's interesting to remember that when “TheHimmel über der Wüste” came out, the image was also a big success. It was following on from that poster, which caused such a sensation, that Zeffirelli called me and said: “Listen, I want you to do me something a bit like you did for “ TheHimmel Uber der Wüste" And I remember that my wife and I went to his home on Via Appia to see what had been filmed. I couldn't find an element that I could tie in. I thought "I can't do this, I didn't want to do it." It would have been disloyal to “TheHimmel über der Wüste” and also disloyal to myself, because I never repeated myself. I tried to create something slightly similar, but I couldn't do it and I refused. But one should! I was amazed that a great director like Zeffirelli wanted such a compromise. This is a sketch that means a lot to me because I did it in America. I was in Los Angeles working on the advert for the American market. Here's “The Girl from Trieste.” I've got an interesting story to tell about this. I lent my hands to draw this because... Ben Gazzarra played a comic strip artist but he couldn't draw the comic strip himself, he couldn't do the drawing, so I lent him a hand on the set. This is a film by Lelouch which was called “Les uns et les autres,” but this title didn't work for the Italian market and so De Micheli and I decided I should produce an almost definitive sketch with the title “Bolero.” And when Lelouch saw the definitive sketch with the title, he was convinced and said: “It's great. Let's go with this.” "Vacanze di Na tale.” This is a real classic! It was such a good idea that it became a cult image and comedies have continued to look back to it. In fact, the latest film of this kind, “Super Vacanze di Na tale,” drew lots of inspiration from it. I'd even say it's identical, but this makes me proud in a way. Cross, but proud! This was a truly wonderful period when we were really free to work and create... Our creativity was spontaneous. We were able to really enjoy working and creating. I don't know whether artists today have the freedom that we had. I don't think so. I have to say that Dino De Laurentiis was someone who fascinated me and influenced me more than anyone else. He particularly liked working with me. After he moved from Rome to London and New York, he always called me to make posters, because he produced films for American companies too. If it hadn't been for my family ties in Italy, I would have moved to Los Angeles. When Dino moved to America, he always sought to surround himself with Italians who not only guaranteed a professional result, but also meant he had people nearby whom he could discuss things with. One of these Italians whom Dino really esteemed was Renato Casaro. Dino De Laurentiis was filming at the famous Pinewood Studios in London and he called me up to ask me to do some sketches for “Flash Gordon.” Once again there were other production and distribution requirements and they wanted British poster designers, but he said I had to design the poster for “Flash Gordon” too. And when I went to London, his driver here in Rome brought me a bag full of yellow and red peppers, saying “These are for Dino. Take them to him because he loves grilled peppers.” There were no customs checks at the time, you could take in anything, so I got there with these peppers and he was so pleased! This shows just how Italian he was. He was great. Great! I did the whole “Conan” series. I knew the character came from the world of comic books, but nothing more. In order to make the poster for the first “Conan” film I had to join Dino De Laurentiis and his daughter Raffaella on set, because he wanted to show me the set and get me to talk with the director. I remember that on-board the domestic flight from Barcelona to Almeria I was really amazed by the local people. They all looked like Apaches... They had marked faces, like Mexicans. It was like being in America. Anyway, I met Schwarzenegger as soon as I arrived on set. He wasn't anybody at the time. Just a Mr Muscle, a gym addict. Back in my studio I created some poses for Conan using models and studying their anatomy. I drew this Conan whose face didn't look like him at all, focusing more on the expression of the comic character than the actor, so that the face was different. However, De Laurentiis said to me: “Look! I want to make him famous.” And so I changed the face to make it look like Schwarzenegger. Then I went on to do “Conan the Destroyer” and “Red Sonja,” which was a bit like “Conan.” Posters for films such as “Maciste,” “Hercules” and “The Evil Dead” took me around three days, four at most, when there was a particular face involved. Meanwhile, more important films took five or six days after I'd come up with the idea. Here's what used to happen: I'd watch the film, then talk to the director if possible, then look at around twenty stills, I'd do a dozen or so sketches, then I'd pick two or three and present them to the client. Lastly, I'd create the final version. This was common practice. I always tried to push the best ideas through by writing one, two and three on my proposals. Number one was always my favourite and that influenced the client to some extent. I always aimed for the best result. I always made sure that people liked me. This was important. I was always professional, I did my best, I met deadlines, because as you know the deadlines in the world of cinema are always very tight. But I always met them, working at night or even on Christmas Day. If there's an emergency, you have to go! Because... If you work for a client who gives you a package of films, with one really important film and two less important films, you still have to do all of them. You can't just say: “No, I'm not doing this one because it's a B movie.” That's simply not professional. I have to say we had really long meetings with Renato and they were always very enjoyable, because he always wanted to amaze us, he always said: “What do you think of this? Do you like it?” And you couldn't contradict him. You always had to say yes. Then, as you discussed it, you guided him towards what would work best in terms of bringing in the audience. In the case of minor films I tried to draw out... something interesting to make it more visually appealing... I sometimes told a few lies in these posters, in the sense that I depicted something that wasn't in the film, but which grabbed the public's attention. In the case of more important films, big-budget movies, it was more important to study things carefully. You couldn't make mistakes or bluff your way through. A mistake on an important film could make it a flop. Let's be clear about it. In terms of communication, the painter could have an idea of what to paint in order to get the message across to the public, but they also had to think like a graphic designer, because at a certain point the poster also had to include graphics to comply with the contract. There were contractual obligations to directors, actors, lots of actors. Perhaps the producers hadn't been very good at drawing up the contracts and so maybe a certain name couldn't feature above the title but had to be below it or the poster had to have the words “and featuring” and perhaps there were three of these. And where do we put them? How do we include them? We already have the stars! There are always compromises to be made. In fact, real skill involves overcoming these difficulties, using subterfuge where possible and saying this can or can't be done. If there are ten horses in the film, you have to show fifty or one hundred, perhaps with some dust! I remember one client who said: “I'm paying you for horses, not dust!” Because I'd tried to add dust to create a sense of movement. I did the worldwide advertising launch for “Once Upon a Time in America.” I produced various sketches because it was an important job. I had to find something that would sum up a spectacular and very long film, I think it was 4 hours long — packed with different episodes and a complex story. Then there were the big international distributors and an American producer, so there were all sorts of things to resolve and different needs to be met. I finally picked this idea and presented it to the meeting of distributors in Rome. Sergio Leone loved it, but the German distributor said: “Yes, it's great, but it needs a woman!” Sergio Leone said: “Well, behind every man in a dinner jacket there's always a great woman!” There was nothing he could say after that. However, I went on to make a more commercial version for the German. Unfortunately the printed poster didn't come out in Italy. They just used some photos... which were beautiful to look at, but nothing compared to the emotion generated by Renato Casaro's design. I loved to be free. With the big American or Italian film studios, such as Titanus, you always had to go through a second or third person, so I felt a bit uncomfortable, because I was used to doing everything: art director, creative, I did it all... Casaro is an artist, and sometimes he became fixated on things I didn't agree with. We sometimes had heated discussions and I felt guilty about it... There should be disagreements between people who mutually respect one another, because it is through disagreement that you reach perfection. If two people have a different concept, they can talk about it and discuss it, getting rid of anything superfluous and achieving the ideal result. I've also had some bad periods in my life that had a negative effect on my work. In short, I certainly had my problems! We were a team of two. We were great friends and we were also tied by this passion for our work. He always sang my praises and defended me against all criticism. Osvaldo was good! I'd even say that he was responsible for my leap forward in professional quality. Almost always, the final result was not the work of Osvaldo De Michel, but the work of Renato Casaro. And if there is also part of Osvaldo De Micheli in Renato Casaro, I have to thank Renato Casaro, and not vice versa. I am so pleased that he acknowledged the importance of our teamwork. We were a great team. There aren't teams like that anymore! He moved to Germany in the 1980s and began working on international projects. The realism he had developed in the 1970s became hyperrealism. He carried on using acrylics and tempera to paint his figures, but he also started using an airbrush to tone down the contrasts, accentuate the chiaroscuro effect, soften the background and create better perspective. His new style brought him to the attention of major directors and he truly became an international poster designer. The 1980s were the years of the annual comedies by the Vanzina brothers, “Time for Loving,” “Vacanze di Na tale,” etc. They were the years of Verdone, his continuation of Italian-style comedy, and they were also the years of Celentano. Casaro created some beautiful posters for all three of these genres. The idea for this poster came to me when I was driving from Treviso to Rome. I think I was probably somewhere in Tuscany when I saw this turbulent sky, with these clouds rushing together, and I said to myself: “This could be the sky for “Joan Lui.”" I can remember something else too. Since Celentano was also the film director, he was very slow, he was making the Cecchi Gori production team lose a lot of money. When I visited the set to show him the sketches, and the production director said: “Stop, don't move. Don't distract him or he'll never finish the scene. Leave him alone please!” He was very positive. He had an anarchy about him that was over the top at times, but during that period he was a huge star. His films such as “Joan Lui” were really unusual. His inner madness was well expressed, because he expressed it with a creative form all of his own. It was always interesting. He was a highly creative man, a man who wanted to break the mould. Ultimately you have to wait and see the end result. Fortunately his films were successful and that was the key to everything. Renato Casaro's creativity was a perfect match for Celentano and the posters were always great. I once said to Casaro: “Do you know what? We could make a comic strip of the film. The sketch comes out so well, just think what it would be like if we made a comic strip out of it.” “Time for Loving” was complex, because although Dean Film respected us due to the huge success of our previous film “I Fichissimi,” they weren't really convinced. They wanted a more vulgar comedy, something different. And most of all they... they didn't like our cast. The cast featured Jerry Cala once again, and none of the actors were big names. There was Marina Suma, who'd just made a small film, and there were some young actors on their very first film. What's more, there were two actors the production team really didn't want: Christian De Sica and Virna Lisi. They said that Christian De Sica would never be a comedy actor, that he just didn't work on Italian screens. It's easy to laugh about it today, but at the time Christian hadn't taken off as a comedy actor. It was a bit of luck for our film and it also relaunched Virna's career. That year she went on to win the David di Donatello and the Nastro D'Argento and the 2nd phase of her career took off thanks to this film. Because the producers were sceptical about the cast, they didn't want to feature the actors' faces on the poster because they deemed them to be too weak. That was actually a bit of luck. Casaro understood the situation perfectly and showed us exactly what we had imagined without knowing it, a truly spectacular poster. It was the perfect match with what we wanted the film to be and what we had done. When a poster tells the truth, the public who see it in the streets, understand that it's sincere and genuine. Just as it marked the start of an astounding second career for Virna Lisi, so it was the start of a very long and important career for us. And this is partly due to that poster. Casaro had a wonderful idea for “Acqua e Sapone.” He captured the fairy-tale tone perfectly. Because “Acqua e Sapone” is a fairy tale. There I am with a straw, with soap bubbles, and there she is inside a soap bubble. It was like a fairy-tale dream. It was a delicate poster, typical of the 1980s, with that rather carefree atmosphere that really reflects the colours, the atmosphere, the delicacy and the lightness of the time. And then what happened? Well, that the industry, after some time... Well, either because of the film's success or because they were really impressed by the way the film title was written on the poster... - the film did very well - a chain of “Acqua e Sapone” shops sprang up featuring the same identical graphics. No one ever said anything. We saw it as advertising, as a tribute to the film. But it was imitated! Casaro was always very sophisticated, and where did he express this? Not so much in comedies. Mine were very simple comedies. You have to see him in art-house films. That's where the artist's creativity really takes off! "TheHimmel Gber der Wiiste” was particularly difficult. I did a lot of sketches, because it contained a lot of psychological elements. It was a complex story. Finally I came up with this idea that isn't in the film. It's not an image from the film, it's all symbolic. A mental and physical embrace, a sense of belonging. You could find all sorts of emotions in it... I had a few problems with this job too, because the contract stated I had to include the two main characters in the poster. Bertolucci was torn for a while, but we were firmly convinced that we wanted to use this idea that went on to become a symbol of how advertising should be done. Bertolucci was a man with a strong personality and great talent. He contributed to the creation of the poster, it's not like we pushed him aside! It's an absolute masterpiece, so much so that Bertolucci was moved when he saw it. He didn't say: “I like it, I don't like it, let's change this.” He was moved! His film went down in history thanks to that poster by Casaro! Just remove the title and it's an amazing painting. But a masterpiece is called so because it only happens once! Working with major directors has always been stimulating because they dissect advertising down to the very smallest detail. They are intelligent people who know what they want. They give you a lot of ideas, a lot of input, to the point that it becomes a challenge: “Look! You gotta do it for me.” And so you put everything you have into it! “The Last Emperor” was certainly not a walk in the park, given its political subject matter. The American producer had already created an ad using an idea that recalled the Chinese flag. I've never liked politics! It never leads to success. Instead, I focused entirely on the atmosphere and in the end I won! I would describe this image with its shadow as smelling of incense. I think the fact that Casaro wanted to attribute such importance to this strip of light that envelops the child, who actually has someone kneeling before him to indicate his power, grasps the very essence of the character and is also one of the finest cinematographic expressions of Storaro's use of light. Let's try and choose the international ones for the exhibition. “Absolute Beginners” can go in. There's this interesting neon effect and it's different from the others. And here's “Amadeus.” We have to include that! It's one of the only ones where I used a green background! Let's take this one. Mickey Rourke, “Angel Heart.” “Barfly"! Mickey Rourke's a handsome man! This one's great. Keep going! “The Name of the Rose” One of the best ones, isn't it? Do you like it? Let's take this one too! Lili Marleen, Fassbinder, Giannini and Schygulla! But you're a bit jealous of Schygulla, aren't you? Nothing ever happened! This one's fun. Do you remember the title? I've forgotten! “High Crusade”! “High Crusade”. That's great! Let's move on. In the early 1980s I moved to Munich, because the market seemed to be drying up in Italy and the prices were no longer appealing. They hadn't gone down, but I felt my work was worth more. If Dino De Laurentiis asked me for a work that would then be used all over the world, well “you have to pay me royalties.” Unfortunately they didn't consider these aspects in Italy. I'm telling you about De Laurentiis, but it was the same for many others. However, this wasn't the main reason. Most of all... I wanted to live near the wonderful Gabriella, who went on to become my wife. I also wanted to get away from certain environments, certain situations, because I'd had a few problems, too. I went to Germany to get away from all of this and live with her. Gabriella was in the business. She worked for a major German distributor who bought American films, so she really helped me make contact with the major production companies. This was fundamental. It was an encounter between two different yet fully merged elements. She advises me, gives me ideas, but above all when I do something, I always do it with her in mind, because she's the first one to give me an opinion, who has to tell me: “You've done a great job.” In banal terms, I could say she's my muse, but there's more to it than that. She helps me in so many ways, she looks after the entire archive, she was the first to salvage many of the originals lying around, she looks after client relations and, above all, given that computers really aren't my strong point, she does all the computer work and this is really essential. She prefers to stay in the background, she doesn't want to be seen. I've never really understood this concept, but I think I understand that she holds back to push me forward. Let's say you're the idol and I work behind the scenes, but I don't want to be seen. I remember seeing this film when I was still practically a child. I was drawn to it by this poster with this huge, three-storey house shown against the light. You could see that there was a totally evil presence within. The incredible thing was that when I went to see this film, this house, which is the one from Hitchcock's “Psycho,” was actually a bungalow in a wood, and there was absolutely no link. This illustrates the total freedom he sometimes had when working on projects of this kind, even changing the title, because it was originally called “The Evil Dead.” At this point it's clear that to give a meaning to the title they invented a kind of franchise that obviously led to other spin-offs in Italy, because the first two films are by Sam Raimi, then there's the 3rd and 4th by Umberto Lenzi, and then other Italian directors who obviously followed in their footsteps. Lastly, we have the third part of the international trilogy, but in Italy it's called “The Army of Darkness,” which is another film. They created a big mess in this case, but it's quite funny. Then there was a whole series of “Houses”, which obviously all had a similar logo and title to try and cash in on the first. In marketing terms, these were all very interesting. “Opera” is amazing! We have these eyes held open by big pins and the theatre that looks like a face, a diabolical mask, with the boxes arranged in a satanic laugh. I think it's one of his masterpieces. This poster had to feature him too, as it was a story about two people. Unfortunately it ruined the centrality of the design for me, so I preferred to leave the typewriter, which is the subject of the film, and I focused heavily on her, because she won the Oscar for this film. I tried to draw out that diabolical side of her, that introverted, evil side, and I also wanted to highlight the crucifix, because this contrasted hugely with such a diabolical personality. Then I obviously had to include the house underneath, surrounded by the silent woods, with just the bare hint of a window where we can glimpse him working at his typewriter. For me it began as craft, but it went on to become art, because it incorporates so many prerogatives. I would describe it as popular art, because I see how much interest there is in it primarily among young people. This means that it's stimulating. If there's a critic who says a poster (and I don't mean all posters, because obviously some of them won't be good) Is not a work of art, then he's an idiot. Peace be with him and his idiocy. Art is a very over-used word. If you visit art galleries today, you often feel like being sick. Is that art? If you compare Casaro to Leonardo da Vinci, then obviously you'd say the real artist is Leonardo da Vinci. But if you make a comparison between Casaro and the artists of today, even the very famous ones, then Casaro is the better artist. The strictly commercial link takes nothing away from the artistic worth. Quite the contrary! It's a positive thing, because you have to be good enough to convince me to go to the cinema, you have to live up to the standards of Spielberg, Bertolucci, Kevin Costner. It's anything but a negative aspect! Guttuso is a great painter, but when the Taviani brothers asked him to produce a poster for “Kaos”, he failed. He produced a beautiful painting, which represents Sicily, but it doesn't promote the film. “Dances With Wolves” is an incredible film! I still love it today because it's one of the best films I've ever seen. Once again, I had to completely sum up an epic and complex tale of the American West. I produced two versions. A classic one for the world market with Costner and the Native American chief, and one with Costner painting a white and red sign on his face, indicating the change from a Yankee culture to a Native American culture and this sign encapsulates the whole story. Underneath I summed up the entire film in a stylised fashion. I think I did a pretty good job. In fact, immediately afterwards, Juventus launched its season ticket campaign featuring a man painting black and white stripes on his face. Like in “Dances With Wolves”. I tried to sue because I felt this was inspired by my poster. However, they took it down and I never saw it again! Unlike the Italian designers who usually produced the Italian version of the poster, Casaro actually sometimes managed to impose his on an international level, while on other occasions he made versions for other European countries, such as Germany and the UK. This was something unique to him, because I can't think of any other designers who had a comparable professional artistic career. Casaro manages to give the genre a figurative dignity, an imagery that surpasses that of the film. In many cases, Casaro's posters are much better than the films they have to advertise. An Italian director told me: “I went to watch the film because I'd seen the poster”. It's a real satisfaction to hear something like this from a director! The French went mad for “Nikita” and changed their poster to Casaro's, taking their hats off... to the great master. We lived up to the abilities of the director, and in this case, as it was an Italian-French co-production, we brought added value, demonstrating that the relationship between Italy and France also worked from an artistic point of view. He advertised Besson's film without showing Anne Parrillaud's face, despite the fact she was a famous and very attractive actress, so it could have been well worth putting her face on the poster. But no, he chose to show her bent forward slightly, as if weighed down by what she does, and we don't know what she'll do next. She intrigues the spectator. I have to say that, in my opinion, this poster for “Nikita” is... one of the greatest film posters ever made anywhere in the world. I stopped working when the phone stopped ringing. Clients now preferred to use CG and Photoshop for their advertising. In short, everything pictorial had become old-fashioned and so I had to choose whether to go down this new path that was in demand or say enough is enough. I opted for the latter, because technology was never my strong point. And so I said that's it, I had also reached a certain age. A boxer stops when he's world champion, not when he's past it! The last poster I made was for “Asterix and Obelix” in 1999. It was liberating, but difficult too in the sense that I was at such a good stage that I was sorry to lose this outlet for my creativity. However... the posters I've seen since, produced by young graphic designers using Photoshop, have lost their creativity. A great deal has been lost along the way, and so I have no regrets. The world of poster design ended with Casaro. Posters are still made today, but with a few rare exceptions I affectionately refer to them all as toothpaste ads, because they're all the same. Using computers, hese huge faces of attractive famous actors and actresses, who are smiling, with these white rows of teeth. They're all the same, they don't capture your attention. Unfortunately time is always pressing. Every so often you see a good one, but generally they're not so great. You can see that posters aren't really important anymore, so they just dash them off. Posters used to be an essential element. In Casaro's day, films were screened for months at a time and there were even cinemas that only showed one film. That's no longer the case, because obviously the production of the material is much more involved than it used to be. This also means that we have to develop many more things. The general approach is usually much more complex, but this is also because film watching and promotion dynamics have changed. Today, the film's life span is established during the first weekend of screening. However, we've seen an inversion in this trend lately. For example, there's been a return to using illustration or at least some more experimental and less conventional images. The ones for American films are more interesting. They're better made, with more attention to detail. The Italian ones are more... They're all for Italian comedies, so... As the quality of films declines, so does the quality of the posters. Photographic posters can of course be made for certain films. However, completing discarding painting is a huge mistake in my opinion. Only painting... implies a truly great film, which we are seeing less and less of these days. On the one hand I'm sad and on the other I'm pleased. Because the rebirth of Italian cinema came about in the 1960s and '70s. Fellini's role in the history of Italian culture, and I'd also say in the history of international culture, is completely unique because it was a society that produced this type of culture. There was an entire population actively involved in producing the imagery that Casaro interpreted so well. The images of those years, the pictures we carry in our heads, are not only tied to our individual experiences. Today we no longer have the cinema, we no longer have posters, but we have other forms: comics for example, which are still very creative in Italy today. Art has been displaced. Having lived in Rome, Germany, and Spain and having travel led all over the world, I've now come back to Treviso. My hometown. In all honesty I have to say that I feel a bit out of place. Coming back, after a 65-year absence, where no one knows you, is not easy. Even Gabriella, who's more sociable than myself, struggles to socialise here. It's complicated. We'll see... The people of Veneto, and particularly of Treviso, are very reserved... But we live quietly, we're happy enough, or I am at least. We've been here for three years now. We have our garden, we keep bees, we have a lovely home, and luckily I'm still painting in my studio, where I love to breathe in the smell of the paints and brushes. Over the last few years, I've also created this series of painted movies, producing posters for great films I would have loved to work on but wasn't able to at the time, either because I was too young or not up to it, or because I didn't have the necessary experience. These are my dream films as a cinema lover, so I thought I would rework them in my own way. Then I also began to draw inspiration from Renaissance classics. For example, I redid “100 Years of Film,” which is a reworking of the “School of Athens”. I'm now finishing my reworking of the “Last Judgement”. It's been a real undertaking! It's full of characters. I wanted to incorporate the entire history of American and Italian cinema in it. It's practically a tribute to the cinema of all time. For me, posters are always the most important document, the film's identity card. Without the poster the film won't be remembered, because the web dissolves. Nothing you see on the web will remain forever, but the poster will. If you have to stage an exhibition you do it with posters, not the web. I have no regrets, and this is important. Perhaps I could have been a director. I thought about it when I was young, but it was just a vague idea. Ultimately I preferred to focus entirely on the art of producing film adverts. Work is still my passion today, even if it's not really for commercial purposes. However, people still seek me out to do some work. If I like the job and it appeals to me, then I'll do it. For example, I recently made a poster that will be used in Tarantino's latest film “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” In this case too, it involved something a bit unusual. Tarantino called me because he wanted me to recreate a poster I'd made in the 1970s. The film was called “Return of Halleluja,” so it was probably a B movie, but Tarantino really liked the genre, the atmosphere, and the painting style of the period. I practically reproduced the same poster, but with Di Caprio's face and he'll definitely be using it for a scene in the film. Then there's also a film by Verdone, which will be coming out at Christmas. This will be another big challenge for me, because I'll be attempting to do something different, perhaps a combination of digital and painting, which can be done! The important thing is to have a subject that you can work with. It's a challenge I'd accept very willingly!
