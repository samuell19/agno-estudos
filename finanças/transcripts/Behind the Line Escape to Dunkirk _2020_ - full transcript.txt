You don't know who he is? How'd you not know? Just never got into it. Tell him, Sarge. I've never heard of him. He has. He has. You're not taking a mick. Watch the line, Private. It's Danny Finnegan. Danny Boy. The Danny Boy. Unbeaten. How many was it, Danny? Don't know. Sorry, mate. Just never got into it. It's all right. I wouldn't worry 'bout it now. He could fight for England. If what? The war hadn't started? Mate, you should see him on his feet. What's that thing they say? It's not about the punches you give. It's about the ones you don't take. Am I right? Right and left. It's like he's not even touching the mat. Come on, show him. This one fight, right. He's still going in the 11th. Not even sweating. Sit down, you idiot. And here comes Danny Boy Finnegan. Light on his feet as he crosses the ring towards the pole. Harper, get down. Roger. A quick left. That one connected like hammer on hoof. Nivinski stumbles. Danny presses. The referee steps in and. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Oh god. Is there a medic? He's dead. Leave him. Bill, come on, come on. What are we supposed to do? Just press and fire. Welcome to the war, lads. Come on, Billy. Billy. Just aim fire. You all right? Let's zero in. One mine is gonna completely blow us to pieces. We need to get out of here now. You two first. Come on. I can't. I can't do it. Billy, come on. Sarge. Smythe, give me cover and fire and don't stop. Billy. Billy. You're coming with me. You ready? One, two, three. Come on. I'm not dying here. I'm not dying here. Danny, come on. Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop. Leave it, leave it, leave it. Come on. What are you doing? We're not gonna use a gas leak coming in too quick. We're gonna get steamrolled. We're not gonna die, Billy. Sir. I'll meet you fast, boys. It means we can return fire, sir. They're gonna get slow down there. We need to pull back. Sir, we need to return fire. With what, private? Well where are the Thompson's? Abandoned. What's the plan, sir? We need to run from here to bloody Robeth. We have to pull back. Fall back any further, sir, we're gonna be in the sea. That's the plan. A place called Dunkirk. What? The Royal Navy are coming to take us home. Why us, sir? To hold beer. Spread the word. That's an order. Pull back, boys. Hey, we're pulling back. Let's go. Billy, he can't hear me. I'll get him. Come on, let's go. We're falling back. We were leaving. We were bloody leaving. Go. Where is everyone? I don't know. I don't recognize any of this. Where's your map? Back at the foxhole. Yeah, mine too. What was left of it anyway. We're in deep shit, Danny Boy. We're still breathing. We're lost. We gotta find that place. What's it called? Dunkirk. We go. North. That's what we do. Go north 'til we see light. Sign post. Something we recognize, all right. Or to sea. Yeah, or to sea, Billy. And home. Recognize any of this? Every bleeding building here's a farmhouse, isn't it? All looks the same. Hang about. We could ask her. I don't think we should, mate. We need to figure out where we are. We're gonna miss this evacuation. Come on. Slowly. Keep your eyes peeled, yeah. Excuse me. No, don't run. We're British soldiers. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I won't tell you again. I will shoot. I promise you I will shoot. Put it down. Put it down. I won't ask you again. Wait, wait, wait. All right, wait. Look. Okay. What are you doing? I've lowered my rifle. Just. Relax. Okay? We just wanna know where we are. We don't understand you. We're looking for the coast. Easy, easy. It's okay. He's scared. English. Thank God. Look, we're looking for directions to the coast. The coast north. North is that way, but the Germans are already there. Where'd you go? We're going to a place called Dunkirk. But we need a. What's French for map? Plan. Yeah, we need a plan. Hey, I can draw you one. Come in and I'll find you food. He says you are welcome here. Do you trust him, Danny. Just keep your rifle and your gun. Go. It is 40 kilometers. You must find Hazebrouck and then you go north to Dunkirk. Okay, thanks. Now some food before you go. 40 kilometers. What's that in miles? Sorry about Papa. He's not himself. My husband went to Lille the day before the Germans came. We haven't seen him since. They say the Germans shoot all the men. What in Lille? No. We were there a couple days ago. Weren't we, Bill? Loads of men got out. Yeah. Loads. Listen. Best be off ourselves actually, so thank you for this and for the map. My pleasure. He's famous, you know. You can tell everyone you met the great Danny Finnegan when this is over. A film star? No. Boxer. Danny, she thinks you're a film star. Danny? Get down. He's ratting on us. He's grassed us up. No. Don't let her look out the window. Shoot him. Don't, don't shoot. Don't you shoot. He's giving us up. You lied to us. Never, I swear. He would never. Is there any other way out of here? What, there's no other way out than this way? No. This is serious now, Billy. We need to find another way out. Jesus. Put it down. Put it down. Go outside. What are you doing? Go outside. They came here for you, not him. Listen. If you shoot me, he will shoot you. They will shoot your dad. You're not like them. Come on. They are gonna shoot him, Danny. We're surrounded. What do we do now? We are soldiers, Billy. We're not heroes. - What are you doing? - Put your rifle in your pack. We're gonna be dead in a minute anyway. And you, Miss, you better hide. Danny, I just wanna go home. Who else is inside? Bring in these two as bargain. Where are they taking us? You are now prisoners of the Reich. Danny Boy. That ain't spent much on a mat, didn't they? You all right, mate? Listen, it weren't your fault. The old man. Farmer. They're Nazis. You know? I don't know, mate. I feel pretty bad inside. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Still breathing. What should we do now? Good morning. My name is Haupstrumfuhrer Drexler and I am your jailer until you are sent to one of our brand new stalags in Germany. Any problems you will come to me. My English is excellent. I was at your university in Cambridge. But how rude of me. You know who I am but I do not know who you are. You. What is your name? Private Williams. Williams. Hush. And you? You do know I already have a list? Corporal Bennett. And which one of you is Finnegan? Danny Finnegan. The great Danny Finnegan. This is turning out to be a most excellent war and we've only just begun. Come with me. Yeah I don't mean to insult you but this is the best I have. The Geneva Convention on the treatments of prisoners of war clearly states they must not be subjected to acts of violence which is ridiculous. We're at war. This whole enterprise is an act of violence. Don't you agree? I'm giving you a chance to to find some honor among all this madness. I'll make it very much worth your while. Thank you very much but I'll not be fighting him. Not for you, sir. Think they went over there. Shut up. Come with me. Where's he taking him? Men like us, we're not built for the ugliness of war. We're dancers, hunters, athletes. We are sportsman. We follow a code, you and I. A quid for the rules. The ref's word is final. Fortune has temporarily put us on opposite sides of destiny, but I'm giving you a chance to at least to be true to yourself. Oh, I'll not be fighting for your thrills, sir. Not for my pleasure. No, no, no, no, no. In two days time, we shall be honored to receive a visit from my superior officer. Obersturmbannfuhrur Lang is a great sportsman himself. And a student. No, a true fan as the Americans say of this noble art of which you have made yourself such a master. You are as we say a gift from me to him. In return, it is within my powers to make your experience of this war considerably improved. How 'bout the lads? Nothing to do with them. Good. Good. Well then you can let them go and I'll fight whoever you want. You know I cannot. Then neither I can. You'll come around and you'll fight or you will find this war very uncomfortable indeed. You've got to do this, lad. You've got to bloody him for all of us. You wanna fight him, you do it. It ain't up to you. He's a coward is what he is. He ain't no coward. I fought with the bloke. He's right. He fights, even if he wins, it's a victory for them. Not for us. Who asked Alibaba? I'm a French soldier Abounouom. He look French to you boys? We don't play things for them to enjoy when and how they choose. That's what I told him. You a pacifist? Hit the bastard. I'll bloody you. Come on then. Sit down. You got us fighting against each other when we should be fighting them. This German is very clever with the whole boxing ploy, he distracted us from our true duty. Sit down. Go on. Escape. Our obligation is to hit them not in the sports arena. No. Where he hurts. In war. So we need to find a way out of here. We need to assess their defenses. How are we gonna do that? Get off me. Looks like it's wash up time, lads. We're not all gonna fit in that. Sir, what are we looking at? MG above the gate. And another one over there. Say about 50 yards. Let's say 50 meters. I'll tell you something. He's no fool, this Drexler. He could keep 50 of us at bay with just that one bloody gun. I don't see this as a viable option, fellas. We're not getting out this side. Not alive. Think he's right. Need to start looking elsewhere, boys. Delivery bloke's not armed. Head's up, boys. Guard coming. Private Danny Finnegan. Private Jaime Williams. Come with me. All right, what's all this about? What do they want? Come on, Jaime. Be all right. What's going on there? Don't know. I've just been on the telephone with Obersturmbannfuhrur Lang. He's very much looking forward to watching you in action and while this is unseemly for an officer of the Reich to negotiate with surrendered prisoners, it is also incumbent on the officer to adapt to immediate needs. Special circumstances require unique solutions. I am willing to make a one time only offer and allow let's call them generosities to your fellow prisoners. What you got? I have some influence over where they will send you. To which camp. Some of them you will find far less agreeable than others. Not enough. Believe me. If you were to meet some of old sailor colleagues, you would not regard this offer as a trifled. Not good enough, sir. Last chance. We ain't gonna let him fight even if he wanted to. Wait, Jaime. So what, Danny? It's all right, Danny. What doesn't he get, Danny? Hang him up. No, wait. Wait. All right stop, wait. I'll do it. I'll fight him. Excellent. How do I know you will how do you say it, give it your all? I give you my word. Very good. Your word but what guarantees do I have? Look, I said I'll fight him. Then let us not disturb my man while he is training. Come with me. No, no, no. Wait, wait. I said I'll do it. I said I'll do it, all right. I'll fight. You ain't gonna hurt him, right? Look, I will fight on my honor. Unfortunately you missed your opportunity to act purely for honor and made this a nasty little transaction. I said yes. The royal air force were busy over Melville last night. Nothing to stop our advance of course, but this morning it seems most of the town is well, it has less need for stairs than yesterday. I understand they will be digging cavities out for days. Then comes the complicated task of establishing who is who. Many of the corpses they pull out will never be identified. One more body among so many will not be noticed by anyone. Oh God. What have they done to you? I said I'll do it. Yes, you gave your word and now I'm reassured you will keep it. Maybe later, eh. It's protein. Strength for your fight. I can't take your food, mate. I can't take it. These boy have lost all their hope. If we are going to get out of here, we need you to help us. I'm not sure I'm the man to help them. Give us back the hope. The hope that we can win. And we will find a way out of here. Each one of us will starve for you to win. You lot want me to fight this German then? Yes, lad. Not me. I just don't like the sausage. Big night tomorrow. You were right about Jaime, you know. It changes nothing. You don't have to go through with it. You can still back out. Time to back out was before we joined up, mate. What are you doing here anyway? Why'd you sign up? You look like you're living outside of East England, boy. Got charged with burglary in '39. Went up against this judge. He was only friends with Colonel Doyle. Gave me a choice. And here I am. Some choice he give you, huh. Well, you're gonna lay one on this crap. You're gonna get us back on our feet and I'm gonna find a way out of here. Yeah. Why not? All your lads are out there. Drexler said that it'd give it a sporting atmosphere. He's clever, ain't he? Brought them along to see me go down. Locals, too. And full of SS. Wouldn't be surprised if it kicks off. Right. Bill, I gotta tell you something, mate. You see when I won my belt, right, I beat a lot of hard men. Do you understand? I can imagine. Yeah, but once I won it, it all changed, you know. See once you're the champ and you got the belt around your waist, that's it. Betting goes up around you and you're living in fantasy land. What are you saying? I ain't had a hard fight in seven years, mate. That can't be true. I'm being serious. They've been journeyman or they was weak opponents or sometimes it was just rigged. Danny, what are you telling me? I thought you didn't wanna fight 'cause I don't know. Not 'cause you were scared. Get up. Don't ask him. I came to wish you a good bout and to remind you of are understanding. And there's one more thing. Too tight? No. It's fine. You will not win this bout. Do you understand? Make it a good fight. A close fight. But if you are still standing in the 10th round, you will go down. If you are still standing. You sure that's not too tight? I do not need to remind you of the sincerity of my conviction. I'm quite sure you don't want it to be me strapping up your hands next time. Careful, sir. Your sportsmanship and your honor seems to be slipping a bit. Please. You're not stupid. It's never a matter of honor. Only a Finnegan losing. We're at war. Victorious warriors win first then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first then try to win. That big fellow out there, does he know I'm going down? Does he? Rottenfuhrer Bartho Kraus has his own orders. He will be trying to kill you. Good luck. Listen. Tell you later. From the Waffen SS Panzer Division, Rottenfuhrer Bartho Kraus. Danny Finnegan. British expedition core representative. Heil Hitler. Danny, forget about what happened before. It's all gone now. Just get out there and win it for us. I don't know what I'm supposed to say. I don't even know the rules to be honest. I don't think there are any to know, mate. Here. Keep your feet lively and hit him hard I suppose. Distance, Danny. Danny. Come on, Danny. Yes, boy, come on, Danny. Come on. Yes boy, Danny. Yes boy. One. You got him. He's out. No, not this round. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Okay. He's good. You're better. Danny, you're gonna win this one. Come on. Danny, you look amazing. He can't handle you, you beautiful boy. Yeah, what? Where's the wrestling gum? Where does it go? Put it on the cut. I see. Just on the cuts I said. What's it for anyway? The shots, they slip off. Does it work? We'll find out, won't we? Come on. Here we go. You've got him. You've got him now. What round is it? 10. This is it. Clobber him. Finish him off. Lay one on the bastard. Come on, Danny. Three to get up. You can do it, get up. One. Stand up. Get up. Come on, get up. Come on. Stand up. Get up. Danny, up. Danny, get up. Come on. Get up, come on. Six. Seven. Come on, Danny, breathe. Get up. You can do it. Come on. Nine. Danny? And they're all smiling and cheering 'cause they think they've got him licked, but our lad won't stay down. No, our glorious warrior clambers to his feet and drawing on deep wells of strength no one knew he had. Not even himself. He lunges across the ring. And as the big Bavarian beast comes right at him. Ph. Ph. Ph. But our crowd killer counters with a left. And a right and another left and another. And then the boy from Bethnal Green goes in for the coup de grace. It's all right, Bill. What does he bloody want? You have a fast right. A strong left. You have fought well. Congratulations. This is all very well beating a private from the ranks. A beast. Had a good technique and full of spirit, but lacking shall we say true Aryan physique. You will never win against a real champion. My champion. Maximus Sennenhund was a world champion. Heavyweight. He's dead. I agree to one fight with your man. Not gonna be your play thing. Play thing? Games. You think these are games? Everything we do is for a purpose. National socialism does not consist of grand gestures and extravagant acts. It is an attitude. A way of life. Millions of tiny acts a day. Each one in themselves is nothing like a raindrop, but together they create the fury of a storm. I have made the necessary arrangements and delayed your departure to Germany. You'll have one week to heal and you'll all be taken to a prison camp south of Bailleul. But. The night before you leave. You will fight my man and you will lose. What happened to your man? Man I just fought. Mr. Kraus has been transferred. I told you to go down. We have kept your friends in here as insurance. If you deviate again, everyone in that barn will find themselves at the bottom of a bomb flattened French schoolhouse. A week but where? Didn't say specifically. Germany. That's all the specifically we need. And while you've all been having fun setting up your little fan club, you've forgotten what we are and where we're heading. We're not heading anywhere. We're going home, aren't we? So what you gonna box your way out of Germany now? No actually. I'm not gonna box my way out of Germany. So what? Well we're gonna escape before we're even taken to Germany, aren't we? That bloke punched your head too hard. He's right. We need to escape this week. And how we gonna do that? I don't know. Well we better think of something. Otherwise you're gonna have to fight that monster and then we're all headed for Germany. Not all. Not Danny. I can't see you surviving even three rounds with that mountain of meat. There you go, lad. Always a bright side, eh. What you said about the fight before the war, I'm sorry I called you scared. I was wrong. Ah, you weren't. I was scared. I don't care what you did or you didn't do. Poor blokes like us are always gonna have our fight through a battle ridge. I mean, look around you. Billy. Billy, look who it is. The delivery bloke. No, that's no bloke, mate. Look. It's that girl. The girl from the farm. It's our answer, isn't it? Come with me, Billy. What are we doing? Sorry Archie, I'll explain later. Come here, Finnegan. Stop it, wait. Get off it. Back off me. We're on the same side. Hey. Go away. I need to talk to you. No, you'll get us both killed. Go away. Wait, I just. I'm calling the guard. Come on then. You yellow rat. All right when he comes, just drive, yeah. Don't you get in my cart. Whoa. What are you doing here? I just want to talk to you, okay. No, you ruined everything. It wasn't our fault. We were surrounded. What are you talking about? What your dad at the farm. No, not at the farm. At the box. The box? At the fighting. The commander, I had him and you ruined everything. Who's the commander? It was perfect. Every eye on the place was watching you. Except me. And I was about to. And then you leap up. He moves. You took away my one chance. You ruined everything. Now go away. How was I supposed to know that was your plan? I could see out of one eye on the night. It doesn't matter now. Okay, what if you could have another go at the commander? I'm listening. Look, do you have friends? Friends you trust? To do what? I'm still working it out, but just can you find them? I think so but to do what? Just find them, all right. Yeah, but what is your plan? Halt, halt. Got it. What was all that about? What did she say? Didn't really get that far if I'm honest. So what did you talk about? It was weird, Sarge. She said at the fight she was gonna kill Lang. What? Who her? How? She said she smuggled in a knife in her coat. And you saw the place. It was packed. And she's slipping through the crowd. She's going for row after row. Not a guard's noticed her. She's about a foot away from Lang. A foot away from slitting his throat. All because they're all fixated on the fight. Danny. We need to contact Chantalle. We need to send a message to Chantalle. Get that bit of paper and your pencil, Maurice. We gotta write her a note 'cause I ain't gonna get close enough to tell her in person again. Tell her she calls everyone she can trust, all right. Soldier? No, locals. There ain't any soldiers left. Now we ask each person to bring a couple of coats. Coats. And bring them to the fight. Now we get each one of them to slip a coat on one of yous. And then while everyone's watching the fight, you slip out. Slip out? Are you crazy? We're gonna get caught in minutes. No because I'm gonna give them a fight that they can't take their eyes off. What about you? I'm going down in the fifth. One of you will have to sneak me out. Or carry me to where I get changed. The room's guarded at the front, but the lock out the back is busted. One pull on that and the next thing we'll be seeing is the white cliffs of Dover. You're joking, right? No, I'm not joking, Maurice. In fact, if any of yous got a better idea, best speak up now 'cause if this don't come off in about three days we're gonna be trapped in Germany. We'll be surrounded by Nazis. The star hub. Secret police. We're still in France, boys. Yeah? Still a war going on. He's right. We need to get out before they take us to Germany while there's still chaos out there. Then what then? Dunkirk. Yeah. Then home. You got all that? Good. Now we just gotta make sure she gets it 'cause all our hopes of getting out of here are on that one little bit of paper. We can't risk them catching me anywhere near her again or she's dead, too. We're gonna need another diversion. We gotta make sure every screw's eyes ain't anywhere near me. The Krauts will already be on edge after this little fiasco. They won't fall for fisticuffs twice. He's right. Yeah, he is, isn't he? Let's think of something else. Something bigger. Much bigger. I've got an idea. Do it. Do it before I change my mind. What? Ah. Medic. You bastard. Medic. Doctor. We need a doctor. Doctor. Doctor. I need a medic. We need a doctor. Look at my hand. Doctor, doctor. Well lads. We've done our bit. Let's hope the girl does hers. Never was much one with an ax, Billy. She better find that note. Or I'll never play the piano never again for nothing. Oh God, mate. You played the piano? Could've learned. Not anymore. She'll find it. How'd you know? She will. Well if she doesn't, we're all dead. So stupid. Idiot. You're all missing the one main flaw with this plan. This is only gonna work if you survive long enough for us to get out. You don't even know if you can go at least five rounds with that beast. He's a monster, he is. It's whether or not you can stay alive. I came to say goodbye in case you don't make it. Okay. I believe if things had been different, we would've been friends you and I. You're not here to tell me to take another dive, are you, sir? On the contrary. Tonight. I want you to give it your all. That's your only way out of this with your honor. He's gonna knock your boy's head clean off. I look forward to him trying. The third SS Panzer Division will be talking about this evening for a very long time. Yeah, you can bet on it. One way or another. Finnegan. Good luck. Yes, yes, yes. You're too quick for him. I doubt I have five rounds of it. Get them ready. Here we go again. How we getting on? Three have got out. Harry, Rich, and Zaid. It's actually working. They'll be halfway to the coast by now. We get Archie and Maurice out next. All right, come on. And then it's us. I'm gonna go check on the door. They found the door. They sealed it up. Come on. Out back. There's no way out. All right. What's up? You gotta get out of here now. I ain't leaving you. You go, mate. Go on. We're sticking together, mate. We'll find another way out of Germany. Hey. You gotta let me win one on my own, mate. You ain't gonna win. We already have, Billy. Billy. Cover and fire. No, no, no. Come on.
