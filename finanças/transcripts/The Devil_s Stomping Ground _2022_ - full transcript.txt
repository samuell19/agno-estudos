Chatham County 911, what's the address of your emergency? I don't know. It's the Devil's Stomping Ground. - Just-- just send help! - Okay, sir. Please try to calm down. What's your name? My name's Robin. What's the nature of your emergency, Robin? I don't know what the fuck happened. They all just freaked out, and now we need the help. What do you mean, they freaked out? The girl... my friends... everyone! It's horrible! Please try to explain, sir. I'm all alone... there's so much bl-- You're gonna be watchin' me, but I'm also gonna be watchin' you with this headcam action. All right, hang on, there's something wrong with this thing. You gotta hold in that doo-hickey on the side to open the lens cap. Well, the last person that used this must have had a PB&J for lunch or something. Dude, really, bro? Yeah, it's sticky all over. Oh, okay, okay. I got it, I got it. Greetings, people of Earth. - My name is Robin Too-- - Hey, hang on. You gotta slate the card first. Oh, yeah. Right. This is Card Number One, of Robin and Trevor's junior project, currently titled "Apocalypse." Let's do it later. Good evening. My name is Robin Toobein. We are here at the place specially known to many as the Triple J, Jonah, Jimmy and Jake's place. We're here because with just one week left until the senior project is due, Jonah has finally decided to act like a director and has called a production meeting. It is our assignment to bring you behind the scenes of Dr. Claypool's independent production group, Number Three, aptly dubbed "The Slackers." To witness their efforts in creating a short narrative film that, well... doesn't suck too hard. Hey, you can't say stuff like that on this. You know, Trevor-- Okay. Fine. Just do that pan up trick so we can cut back in. Aptly dubbed The Doomsday Clock, to witness their creative efforts and document behind-the-scenes drama that incubates and thrives in the stress-fueled confusion of status and self-worth that is a movie set. In this, sell your soul and whore your body for a-- Whoa, whoa, Robin! You can't say "whore" in a student film. Dude, who says? Dr. Fregola shows porn in his Dreams in Films class. We watched them together. You remember the fire pussy shot? Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, I remember. But if this gets in trouble, I'm throwing you under the bus. Yeah. That's fine. In this, sell your soul and whore your body for an internship with the studio jungle that we all hope to graduate into. There's just one question that must be answered. Do you have the talent to rise up and create a film that thrills an audience without going over schedule and busting the budget? In this case, a bunch of stoners who are already behind schedule? The odds are long indeed. But enough prognosticating. It's time to mask up. Ooh. - Good break, man. - Yeah, guys. Hey. How are you all doin'? - What's up? - What's up-- We're just shootin' a doc. Um, so-- Well, howdy, boys. Come on in. The gang's all here. Well, hey, Dexter. Hey, you're lookin' hot this evenin'. Well, thanks, baby. Exhibit A. - Want a hit? - Ah, thanks but no thanks. Uh, Zack, I'm sorry. I know it's corny to say, but I kind of believe in that old adage about the-- you know, the body being a temple. Hey, no, no, no, that's not corny, dawg. - Good on you. - Dammit! I'm impressed. I've never seen you get that far before. That's nothing. I've made it all the way to the end before. Oh, you have? Yeah, I bet you have. You always know what you're doing. Ew. Perhaps the two of you should get a room. Well, fuck you, Robin. Jesus. Uh, dude, I'm sorry, Willow. Hey, look, we'll-- we'll edit all this out. Right? Okay, let's see what else is happenin' tonight. I'm now approaching the epicenter of Team Slackers' brain trust. Jonah's room. I do now, cause, like, that shit, you come see me for that type of stuff. - Oh, hey y'all! - Hey! - What's up? - What's the deal, bro? We're just shootin' some footage for the doc. - Oh. - Okay. Oh, hell yeah, man. I did the same thing last year. Operation Confusion Tubes. Yes! That was funny, dude, I loved it. - Friggin' awesome. - Come in. Yeah, man, come on in! And you can take off your masks. We get tested once a week anyways. Cool, man. Uh, appreciate it, yeah. I'm-- I didn't mean to interrupt y'all, but, uh, we'll just, uh, we'll slide in the background. Hey, Trevor. - You know what to do. - Yeah, man. So where were we? We're still tryin' to figure out a story for our film. Okay, cool. Ideas, guys, what's up? A musical! A punk rock version of Singing in the Rain. That's not bad, but none of us are musicians. Yeah, and we don't have the money for that, so 86. - What else we got? - Oh, yeah. Ooh, you got it. Ooh, we can make like, a tripped-out surfer video. Ah, that sounds fun. But it has to have a narrative. You can make a surfer video that has a narrative. Could be a summer love story. You know, that's a real suck job of an idea. For real. Total suck job. Hey, I might have something. What you got, brother? The Devil's Stomping Ground. Ooh, that sounds awesome. Wait, what's that? Uh, it's a real place. Not far from here, and near Asheboro. Apparently there's a circle of ground back in the woods that... nothing ever grows in. Yeah, uh, legend has it that the Devil stomps around there late at night and plots his evil deeds. - That sounds scary. - Yeah. Yeah. It says that those who have dared just staying out in the circle at night are never the same afterwards. Never the same how? Mentally. Uh, says that they have a hard time focusing and fall into these self-destructive behaviors that have, in most cases, led to strange and untimely deaths. Oh. I don't like this. Liz, it's just a folk legend. Veasna, you know, not everyone's into horror films. Not everyone has a brain, either. Oh! Oh, easy ladies. All right? Far be it for me to break up a catfight, but, uh, priorities. - So. - Oh. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. But Veasna has a point. It does need to be a narrative. So what's the plot? Uh, well, we could make it about a group of college kids who decide to test the legend, and go up there with the intention of stayin' the night. And of course, things go horribly wrong for them. Of course. - Yeah. - Yay. Yep. That's perfect. Yeah, uh... we'll need that production van, and, uh, I'm gonna want tha-- the red camera. Okay. Well, shit. Let me hit up Claypool. - All right. - All right. Jimmy, can you start on the script? I already have, brother. And can you cast Kelly as the lead? I already am. Yay, I love you both. Hey, do you think you can get us three other actors, - uh, play your co-stars? - Yeah, sure thing. Sweet, yeah, we'll need a, uh, a hot Gypsy chick, a hot surfer dude, and a young male priest. Nice! Yeah. All about our age. Wow, okay. So I get to be the lead and the casting director, too? Wow! And my cousin, Robert's, in seminary school up in Fayetteville, and he's always wanted to do some acting. -I'll give him a call. -Perfect! Yeah, Fayetteville's actually right on the way there. Yeah. Yo, yo, yo. Check it, all right? - Claypool says we're good to go. - All right. So long as we take care of the van, we take care of the gear, but most importantly, we're punctual bringin' that shit back. Did we get the red camera? Dude, we got the red camera, that's-- - Hell yeah! - As long as you guys go - and get it, bro. Yeah. - Oh. But yo, for real, listen. Most importantly... Monday morning? Gotta bring that back. So here's the plan. Go up there tomorrow. We film all day Saturday. And then we bus it back down Sunday. Easy peasy. And how does that work in regards to the script? Uh, perfect, yeah. We're only shooting one scene here on campus, and the rest of it will be on the road and at the Devil's Stomping Ground. The Devil's Stomping Ground? I've heard of that. Oh, God. My mom used to call it the, uh, the Devil's Tramping Ground. Oh, you must have a really cool mom.. She's all right. So, um, judging from the title, it sounds like you may need some special effects makeup? - Uh, Jonah? - Uh, Jimmy? I can certainly write it that way. - Cool! - All right. This is most epic! All right. Everyone, let's get a good night's sleep tonight. It's gonna be a righteous day tomorrow. It's all right. You always did want to get up my skirt, didn't you, Dante? Yeah. Who wouldn't? You're so sweet. You gotta love this behind-the-scenes action. The director's girlfriend, and leading lady, is already flirtin' with the sound dude. Hey, no, I'm not! Seriously, Robin? Just statin' the obvious. You can't show that to Jonah. Oh, yeah. We won't. We'll edit it out, right, Trevor? Yeah, man, it's-- it's no problem. Oh. Dr. Claypool! What an honor to finally meet you. Oh, yeah? Yeah, is there where I slap some sense into you, -or put you on a leash? -All right. -Where's Jake? -Oh. Professor Marty! Oh, my man, how you doin'? Yeah, what's the deal, bro? How you feelin', man? Long time no see. Likewise, man, but thank you very much. We appreciate you doin' all this, hookin' us up. So, you wanna be responsible for takin'... this motley crew on the road? Motley crew. Ordinarily, no, but, uh, these guys got a really good concept, so I'm in. Ay, we don't want to spoil the plot -before the big premiere. -Eh. Okay. Let's just say we got a good concept, yeah? -Yeah, real? -All right. Sounds intriguin'. Nice work, man. Um. Mind if I stick around and, uh, observe a little bit? -No, not a problem, man. -Of course. -You do your thing. -All right. -Good to see you, brother. -You too. -Be well. -All right. Tiki torches. Yes. -Hey. I got it. -Oh. -Thanks, Zack. -Yeah. -I appreciate your help. -It's no problem. You don't talk very much, do you? I say things sometimes. Well, like, just now you said something. That was so cool. Okay, um, I can try to talk more. No, it's okay, I totally get it. And, like, why do anything you're not fully committed to? It's like, the basic premise of Method Acting. You go all in, all the time. Okay, everyone to their one marks, please! Kelly? - Thank you. - Hi. Your one mark's that. Good. Last looks! Found it. Found it! Oh, I love it! This is gonna put me right where I need to be for my character. Mm-hmm. I'm so glad you approve, Ginger, darling. Jonah! Hello, my leading ladies. Ready to make cinematic history? Yeah. Feeling good. Let's-- let's do this. The Devil's Stomping Ground, scene one, take one, marker. Camera's in the one position. No beads, remember. On the girls? Oh, yeah. Shit. Sorry! No worries. Okay. Set! And action! I think we should do it. And this place is only, like, two hours from here. It's more like three, but... What place? Ah, this crazy place. It's called the Devil's Stomping Ground. Woah, sounds pretty radical. -Yeah, it's near Asheboro. -What is it? Physically, it's a patch of land in the woods where no vegetation grows. Been that way for centuries. But according to legend, the reason that nothing grows within that circle is because the Devil goes there late at night, stomps around the bonfire, plotting his evil deeds. They say he who sleeps upon the trampled circle will be forever changed. And not in a good way. Cool. Sounds pretty spooky. Mama hates when I talk about the Devil's Stomping Ground. She calls it the Devil's Tramping Ground. Ginger's mom is a psychic. She's famous on the Internet and stuff. -Yeah, she's hot shit. -She is. I mean, she's done like, three exorcisms. Yeah, and two were actually successful. Every time I bring it up, Mama makes me swear I'll never go there. And yet that's exactly what she's trying to get me to do with her. Well, that sounds far out. When? -This weekend. -Tonight. Right, so, just a second. You wanna go three hours to a place called the Devil's Tramping Ground, to spend the night there tonight. Yes! Let's test the theory. What's the worst that could happen? We could be forever changed. Sounds like a blast to me. -Guess we're in. -Yay! Fuck yeah, let's do it. And cut! That was great. Let's do one more for safety. This stupid tape isn't working. I'm gonna have to use the MOS one with Velcro. Okay, I'm on record for being against all this. No. Whatever, Trevor. Look. I gotta have eyes on them while they're shootin', okay? So it's candid and real. Woah! Dr. Claypool. Uh, I didn't see you there. What a surprise. Why are you so nervous? Uh. Uh. Um, it's just that-- y-you know, my-- my dad's a really big fan of yours. Um, whe-- when I was a kid, we watched all of your different films together, I mean all six of 'em. You know, and I read all your books, too. A real fan, huh? Ah, don't have many of those. Maybe I'll be nicer to you. Yeah, I-- I'm, like, your biggest fan. Uh, you know, besides my-- my dad, of course. He-- he's your biggest fan. Um, it's-- it's kind of funny that you-- you rolled up on me when I w-- we-- I was planting this cinema verité cam, you know? It's-- it's kind of perfect, really. -Say what? -Well... I've always admired, you-- you know, the realism in your films, like, it-- your narratives almost felt like documentaries. You-- kinda like cinema verité style. Well, you know, most of my best ideas were born out of necessity. We didn't have money for coverage, you know. We had to do things on the cheap. That meant scoutin' out the best locations, block the scenes, find just the right places for the cameras. Yeah. And shoot those long rolling scenes. Yeah, like-- oh, like Citizen Kane. -Yeah, like Citizen Kane. -Yeah. Well, see, that's what, like, I'm tryin' to do in my films. Well, somewhat. Uh, except-- I'm tryin' to make my documentary feel more like a narrative. -Huh. Interesting. -Yeah. Well, you know. Y'all carry on. Yo! I told you it was risky to do all this secret camera stuff. Dude. You heard Dr. Claypool. He said carry on. And cut! That was great. Movin' on. Next scene up, our heroes pack their vehicle and take off. Good job, guys. Back, back, back. Yeah, and then pan over... ...then boom, right there. -Are you guys ready? -Yeah. Whoa. Look at that bag. It's my magical mischief satchel. Mm-mmm. What's in it? Oh, just some bits of fun. For later this evening. Nice. Cut! Perfect. - We're done with this location. - Yeah. Okay, guys, that's the company move to the Devil's Stomping Ground! Let's strike the set and prep A unit for shooting in the SUV, thank you! Devil's Stomping Ground, huh? Should be lovely this time of year. Yeah. Me, I never been myself. But I hear it can be pretty exciting, especially at night. All right, look. I wanted to tell you, but Jonah, this is his baby, and it's a secret, and, you know it's con-- No, no worries, no worries. Uh, it really sounds like an excellent premise. Look forward to seein' the final product. Okay, can't wait to show you, man. -Yeah. Oh. Wife's here. -Oh, right. We're gonna be peacin' out. Hey, Jake! Mrs. C, it's good to see you. You too! Tell your parents I said hello, would you? Yes, ma'am, most certainly will. We haven't seen them since before COVID. Really? Okay. I'll let her know. She'll be happy to hear from you. -Take care. -All right. Bring it-- -Bring it in here, man. -All right, brother. All right, so, I'll see you on the flipside? Okay. First thing Monday morning, you and that van. - Bright and early. - Uh-huh. - Without a scratch. You hear me? - Uh-huh. Copy that. -Yeah, all right. -Cool, take it easy. -Thanks again, man. -Uh-huh, sure. Yeah, cool, we're good to go. Yo. Oh, excusez-moi, mademoiselle. Yo, I got that, bruh. - Word. Go ahead. - Thank you. - Oh, hey, hey. - Yeah? Dante. Hey, listen, um. I want to let you know that I put a camera in the back of the SUV, too. To get some footage, you know. While you're shootin' in the other car. Like a spy cam? More like a cinema verité cam. Okay... Yeah. Hey, eh. And, um, you know, can you hook a brother up and just run some, like, B-Roll audio, you know, before and after and in between shoots, just so I can have some matchin' audio? Don't all GoPro have built-in sounds? Some do, but, you know, I could just only get the MOS One to stick to the batch-- back of the hatchback, it's-- it's got the Velcro thingy. Um, why can't we just tell 'em? Well, if we tell 'em, then they'll be acting, and it won't be real, won't be an unfiltered, you know. All right, but, uh, if they find out, look, I had nothin' to do with it. Hey. They said that you're the best sound dude around. - Whatever, man. - Yeah, they're right. Okay, guys, it's time to get saddled up, please. - Let's get up in the van. - Hey, Jimmy, can I get the script for Scene Five? Uh, yeah, you just need the script. - There you go. - Thanks, man. Wait, wait. You guys, you still got the $100 I gave you for gas, food, all that? - Yep. - Okay, cool. Let's get inside, brother. Watch your legs, watch your arms. Okay. You guys be safe, all right? Thanks. Get that. Bring your phones, yeah. Jake, your jacket's there. - Thanks, bro. - Boss man. Yeah, you can stop rollin' now, Trevor. Okay, man, well, I was gonna, but no, you just gotta shut it in my face. Like, I need to get the shot when I'm going in. Too late. You are listening to Zack Radio, ladies and gentlemen. All the greatest songs that you've never heard. That song was really dope, Zack. -What else you got? -Ooh, let's see. I wanna get to know these guys back here. Warm them up for interviews. Okay, man. Kill the noise, guys. You know that microphone's been jacked, and I don't want it messin' up the food. Yo, who the hell wrote-- You know what, y'all just gonna get what I'm orderin', then. I can't even read that, bro. No way. There's actually a Devil's Tramping Ground Road? Yeah, I know. Crazy, right? Wow. Can't believe I've never heard of it. It's been there way longer than you've been alive. Okay, so, um, I was supposed to go visit my cousin, Robert, this weekend, up at his school in Fayetteville, and I kinda cancelled so that we could do this instead. Okay. And? Well, uh, I sort of mentioned to him what we were doing, and he asked if he could tag along. Since he, you know, hates to be alone, and kinda has nothing to do this weekend now, because of me. Why didn't you mention this before? Well, he just responded to my text, like, just now. And... I thought he was angry. I don't know, Kelly, I really don't feel like fending off some random dude, while we're camping alone in the woods. Oh, don't worry. Robert's a seminary student, he's sworn all of that off. For real? Yep, he is no threat at all. Trust me. Okay, well, then. I guess it's okay. Cool. Hey, Robert! So good to see you. These are my friends, Drew and Ginger. Guys, this is my cousin, Robert. We grew up together. -Oh, uh, Drew? Ginger? -Mm-hmm. It's a pleasure to meet you both. Yeah. Okay. Well. So, Elizabeth. Do you have secrets that you'd like to share with us? Sure. I know a secret. Spill it. -Veasna has a crush on Jonah. -I knew it. Who doesn't have a crush on Jonah? Uh, I, for one, do not have a crush on Jonah. I mean, he's cool and all, but that's about as far as it goes for me. Speak of the Devil. Hey, Jonah, what's up, man? Yeah, I was just about to send. And boom. Headin' your way. It should be on the way now. - Got it. - Yeah, me, too. Okay, nice. So, can the three of you guys look over your lines, and Kelly, would you mind reading the parts for Ginger? Sure thing, babe, but it looks like only Robert and Ginger have dialogue in this one. I don't know, we're gonna have to take this shot. Here, here, why don't just use the GoPro for the setup? I'm writing my graduate thesis, and I was figurin' this little adventure could help me with some inspiration. Are you writing about demonic possession? No, uh, probably-- probably not that, exactly. Can be a little lonely sometimes, up at school. All my friends, they're-- they're also in seminary. Let's just say I've always enjoyed, uh, hanging out with regular people. Like my cousin. Gives me new perspectives to consider. Broadens my horizons. So... you've never had sex before? That's kind of a-- a personal question, isn't it? Yeah, you're-- you're right. I'm sorry. I was just-- just curious. N-- no-- no. I-- I shouldn't make such a big deal of it, right? Yes. I have. Once. I was 15. -Was she that bad? -No, no, no. Wasn't her. All right? It was me. It was all a really freaked-out mistake, actually. In the end, she terminated our baby. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. That's terrible. No, no. It was all my fault. I was only thinking about my selfish desires. No, no, I'm sure you did what any red-blooded 15-year-old boy would do. Uh, I don't know. Like, that night, when I-- when I found out, I got right on my knees, and I just-- I-- I begged God for mercy. I swore to him that I would never sin in such a way again. You really shouldn't be so hard on yourself. Okay, cut. Dang, bro, you have to be all up on my girlfriend? Hey, man, what-- I'm just doin' what the script calls for. If you got a beef, just take it up with your brother from another mother. Hey, man. Hey, what's up. Why are you writing in all this kissing stuff? Uh, be-- because it's what the, uh-- - the story calls for it. - Yes. But do they really have to make out so much? Hey, listen. Relax, dude. It's-- you know, it's just pretending. It's what actors do. You know, that-- they act. All right, man. All right, picture's up. Let's run that one again. And action! So, we're here with Zack Russell, gaffing prodigy and overall electrical wizard. So tell me, Zack, why the radio station? What makes you gravitate towards that? Well, you see, Robin, my dad works in a factory. Up before sunrise, after sundown. He comes home in the dark, eats supper and goes to bed. Does the same thing each and every night. Interesting. So, tell me more. Well, his favorite part of the day was right before bed. He listened to his classical music. I remember, when I was little, I went into his room one night, and I asked him, "Why do you love classical music so much?" And he said, "Because it sets me free," in his very tired voice. I get it, man. That's nice. But do you have any other secrets you'd like to share? Oh, no, no, no. My mother told me to never keep secrets, and that honest people have nothing to hide. Oh, my gosh, I love these guys! -Winston Sun Dream? -For real? You've actually heard of Winston Sun Dream? Yeah! My favorite track is "Lines Through Me." Huh. It ain't no secret that I'm a woman trapped in a man's body. I mean, I pretty much wear that one on my sleeve. Yeah, you got that right. Well... what do you think about this, though? Some people say it's a choice to be a person like yourself. And, you know, other people say it's not a choice. And like that song goes, you're just kind of born that way. You know? What camp do you fall into? Honestly, if I'm being straight with you, I'd say it has more to do with the fucked-up shit that happened to me when I was a boy. But I don't want to get into all that, though. I prefer to stay on the sunny side of life. Oh, God. You know, with all these song references, we're gonna have one hell of a soundtrack. So what do you have to say, Willow? What do you want me to say? Well, this is all about you. This is your time. Don't you have any deep, dark secrets that you'd like to unload? I'm kind of a private person. I can sense that. Um, uh-- no offense, but I don't really think that it's right to reveal other people's secrets. Sorry, my bad. Especially if they're a friend. I thought that's what Robin wanted. All right. You're fine, Liz. I didn't specify. And Willow, in regards to holding in your own secrets, you know, centuries of psychological studies have proven that verbally expressing something is, in fact, the best way to defeat the power it has over you. That's bullshit. Okay. I'm a cutter. Do you know why you do that to yourself? Yes, actually, I do. You think that's why you're into, like, the bloody special effects makeup and stuff, or something? I mean, obviously, right? Hey, hey, guys, check it out. Awesome.- Can we stop and explore? Uh, we'll have to hit it up on the way back tomorrow, but, uh, cause we're losin' light, but damn, that looks cool. Yo. Yeah. There's this really awesome, like, old-timey lookin' ruin, on the way up here. You guys should stop and shoot a scene exploring it. But tell 'em make it quick, man. We're losin' light. Jake says he loves the idea, but, uh, make it an MOS montage, and, uh, do it on the fly,. Yeah. Whoa, what's this? It's an old crossroads. Like the story about that dude who sold his soul to the Devil. Wasn't his name Robert, too? Yeah. Robert Johnson. You're Robert Johansen. Let's check it out. Wow. Let's play hide-and-seek. Everybody go hide, go hide. One, two... three, four, five... six, seven... eight, nine, ten! - There it is, up there. - At that. We're finally here. Trevor, you gettin' this approach? Yeah, man. I'm gettin' it. Wow. Finally here. It's really kinda pretty for a scary place. Hang on, guys, I need to get out first, okay? Yup. Looks like it's up there. You guys watch your step, all right? There's a little dip. So, this is it. I mean, I guess it's kinda spooky, but it's nothin' terrifying or anything. Yeah. Yeah, it's not scary enough. Um, check it. Dex, Willow? Can I get you two to work your magic, just tryin' to spook it up, whatever you can do? -Yeah. -Yeah. You got it, babe. Okay, so I think the first scene we're gonna do here is when they arrive, so maybe we could start in the parking area? Uh, there used to be a bunch of graffiti out there, do you think you could draw some scary and foreboding graffiti on the road? -Oh, yeah. I can grab the kit. -Sweet. And can you make a sign or somethin' that says "The Devil's Stomping Ground?" -I know just what to use. -Sweet. Actually, Jimmy, real quick? Like, I appreciate you tryin' to do my job, bro, but, like, need you to go back to the van and do yours, man. No, no, I'm just messin' with you, man. 'Kay, well, uh, I just figured I'm the one writing it, you know, so if Jonah's not here, -I could step up. -Yeah, I get all that. I know you're the writer and whatnot, but, like, we're here at the Devil's Stomping Ground, and we still don't have the script. See where I'm goin'? Right. Point taken. All right, everybody, let's get back to work! Look at me. Yes. Hey, Zack, I can help, too! All right. All right, guys, on "lift." One, two, three, lift! -Got it? -Yep. All right, cool. Fuckin' teamwork makes the dream work. -Let's go. -Let's go. - Watch your step. - Okay. Vines, thorns, all that. Wow. This really is kinda creepy. Ooh, look at this one over here. The Satanic Emblem. Look, I-- I loved Motley Crue, man. They were the shit back in the day. It was on that Rush album too, right? That's right, baby. 21:12. Those bands were very reckless, throwing around the Devil's mark like they did. They didn't actually practice witchcraft. It was just a gimmick to get kids' attention. They may have thought that's what they were doing, but Satan works in very deceptive ways. And cut! All right. Hey, guys-- Jonah, Jonah, we're losin' light, man. Let's get up to set for the walk up to dead circle scene. Please, let's go. Perfect, this is exactly what I want. - Yo, man. - Yo. We got, like, an hour of light left. That is correct, man. Stay on point. Keep it up. Jonah! Yo, we're dressed and ready to go, man, but, like, we gotta go, all right? - You got it, man. - Thank you! Everybody in the walk position! Whoa, this place is sick! It is exactly as I imagined it to be. It looks like it's been used recently. Oh, yeah? Used like how? Well, it is called the Devil's Stomping Ground. Woo! We should get some wood for this fire pit. It looks like it's gonna get dark soon. Well, shall we? I-- I can set up our tents if you like. I think that's a great idea. - And cut! - Movin' on. -Movin' on, buddy, movin' on. -All right. You heard the man! Let's set up for night work. - Hey, great job. - Was that okay? - Yeah, it was great. - Great. Are you gonna include it? Good stuff. Zack, bag it, please. - Got it. - All right. Thank you. Gotta love that movie magic. This is a good perspective for the Watcher in the Woods shot. Yeah, it's also another form of cinema verité. The psycho killer version. Now listen, Trevor. I'm gonna plant a few GoPros around base camp tonight. Okay. I don't know about all that. That kinda seems... dishonest? It is not dishonest. It's actually the exact opposite. It's unfiltered. It's unvarnished. It's as honest as shit gets. Okay, okay. Cinema verité. I won't say anything. Excellent, my friend. You'll come to see that you made the right call. You guys hear about that serial killer dude? They say he's still on the loose. Where, up here? Yeah, near here. They think he's hiding somewhere up in the Uwharrie Mountains. Oh, shut up. You're just tryin' to scare us. No, for real. I saw a thing about it on the news last night. Yeah, I saw that too. Really? Wow. Yeah, they know who it is. Or at least they think they do. Yeah, apparently this guy... was just some ordinary dude. Then one day, for some unknown reason... he just disappeared. Then several days later... they started noticing that young women are going missing in this area. Okay, I'm-- I'm looking this up. No service. Police think he's killed over a dozen women... but it's been hard for them to figure it all out, though. 'Cause, you know, they're all dismembered. Well, when people started finding random body parts along the side of the parkway, the cops started puttin' the pieces together. No pun intended. They said, it seems like he's taunting the police. You know that famous fatal flaw of most serial killers? They secretly want to get caught. So, they leave clues. But they haven't caught this guy yet. Oh, what the fuck? Did the genny just run out of gas? Cut! - Uh, it shouldn't have. - Guys... Let me go check real quick. - What is going on? - Thank you, sir. Dang, honey, you got goosebumps all over you. Me, too. Uh, don't-- don't rub my leg, though. How about me? Can I rub it? I'll rub it 'til the swelling goes down. They haven't caught this guy yet. Okay, that did it. I'm officially scared now. Well, come over here. I'll protect you. That was a spooky story. I'm cold. Do you think you could come closer, keep me warm? Uh, yeah, yeah. I can come closer, if you want me to. That sounds nice. Oh. - Oh. - Hey. -Hey. -I don't like Robert. He's a homophobe. Baby. I appreciate you taking up for me, okay? But you don't have to hate Robert. He's just led a very... different life than me. But that's okay. I admire you. See, when someone slights me, it feels like... God, it feels like I can't breathe, and all I wanna do is just hurt them back. But I admire you, Willow. You always have such a caring and honest soul. You are perhaps the most authentic person that I know. Next to my mama. -And she don't play. -That's funny. Um... you know, I-- I have another secret other than... And what's that? Okay, never mind, I don't-- I don't want to talk about it anymore. -Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. -I know-- No, you can't do me like that now. Tell me. I have a crush on Dante. -I knew it. -No, no, no, no, no. You two are perfect for each other. - You really think so? - Yes, girl. I do. But, uh, does Dante know? Oh, my God. No. I, um, I can't do anything about it. What? Baby. You are a beautiful young girl, with one hell of a personality. What makes you think that he wouldn't be all about it? I've never done any special effects. That's not my thing. Dude, I get that, but you're smart, you're resourceful, we need all the help we can get, -like, man, please. -You're not listenin'. If you have a sound issue, then you can come and talk to me. You know, man, whatever, I can't e-- what's-- what's up, dude? I mean, I can probably help you out, man. You know what? I appreciate that. I don't know why I didn't come to you first, -so thanks. -Hey, it's okay. I'm usually not the first person thought of for a lot of things. But I mean, it's okay. It's my non-assuming and disarming personality that usually causes people to freeze and miss the opportunity. Zack, you are so weird, man, but I like you. And I like that fuckin' shirt, man. -What's the deal with that? -Well, thanks, man. It's a movie called Beyond the Living. My, uh, uncle made it. But it hasn't come out yet, though, so... Word. Good shit, good shit. -Keep me posted, man. -Yeah, for sure. All right, but, uh, the genny. -We saw-- -Oh, yeah, the genny. It was already filled up. That wasn't why it choked. Genny just failed for some reason. - That's weird, man. - Yeah, I mean it's no biggie. Everything chokes every now and again. All right, well, fuck it, it's good now. Thank you, I really appreciate you doin' that. All right. Liz, wait up! Oh, shit! Veasna unmasked? What's the deal with that? Um, well, nobody else is wearing one, obviously, and we're probably all already sick, and are gonna die by now anyways, so what's the frickin' point? So, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. You are crazy. Just messin' with you, man. But, hey. Can I... -say something? -Mm, yeah. Sure. All right, look, like, I don't wanna be weird or anything, and if you don't like what I gotta say, fuck me, you know, but... like, I kinda dig you a bit. Like, I feel like I've been puttin' the vibes out, and on some level, I thought you and-- I don't know, now there's just, like, this weird rumor that you got a thing for Jonah or somethin'. Wait, where the hell did you hear that? Like, Liz. We were bustin' it up here, and, you know, fuckin' Robin's in the back doin' interviews about whatever, and it just kinda came up. Oh, my God. It's just so embarrassing. Mm, I mean, who else knows about this? Besides everyone in the van? So... are you allowed to kiss girls? Well, technically my vow -is about sexual intercourse. -Mm. It's just that things like kissing, they-- well, they-- they intensify the temptation to-- There. You didn't burst into flames. No, it-- it doesn't work like that. So, you don't wanna kiss me again? I absolutely do. Then shut up and kiss me. Cut! Jimmy, can I speak to you, please? So, what are you makin' here? A porno? My man, uh, calm-- calm down. This is all for a huge payoff in the end. Trust me. You're gonna love it. I don't love it. Kelly and I are in love. Yeah. I know. We-- we all know. Jonah, that's my point. Everyone knows you and Kelly are a thing. Yeah. -Oh, I get it. -What? You're jealous and secretly lusting after my girlfriend. That's why you're writing all this sex stuff. -Just to get yourself off. -What-- no. Dude, that's not true at all. What-- Some fuckin' friend you are! Dude, it's not like that, man. Listen, I-- - Yeah, yo. Guys. - I wanted-- Hey. Hey. Listen, man. We gotta wrap this up, okay? We got a lot of stuff to shoot before dawn. Please, like... There's only one more scene with kissing in it, and-- and it's mostly off-camera. Trust me on this. I wish I had a jacket right about now. -It is gonna get-- -You fucking bitch! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Can't believe you told everyone! You know how fucking embarrassing this is? Veasna, calm down. Shut up, Zack! Fuck you both. I'm really sorry, Veas. Is there anything I can get for you? No, Liz. You can't. Just-- just stay away from me. That's a bummer, huh? This is all your fault, Robin. -Let's go in our tent. -Okay. Oh, we're gonna go into our tent for a little while. I wonder what they're gonna do. It's not that hard to figure out. They sound like they're having fun. It's okay. I'm on the pill. Cut! That was great. If you say so, man. So, movin' on to the white gag scene? Yeah, that's right. -Zack, we ready to go, man? -Yeah, man. Me and Liz are all over it. It was, like, ten minutes to prep. -That fuckin' bitch. -Come on, Liz. Oh, shut up already. You guys wanna do something fun? What's that? Let's test a theory. See if this really is the Devil's Stomping Ground. Yeah, sounds rad to me. What do you have in mind? I could lead us in a séance. - Like your mom does? - Something like that. I won't be as good as she is, but... maybe being here will help, if there is anything to here? In a séance, the goal is to contact specific people who have died. Who are we attempting to contact? Saint John! Dang it, Drew. You scared me again. Let's do it! Yeah? Awesome. Okay. Let's join hands. Close your eyes, everybody. Oh, great morning star. We have come to this place seeking your wisdom. You fell from the heavens of your own accord, and you created a kingdom with vast powers forged in fire and became greater than thou's creator. Dear Lucifer, if you are here with us in your tramping ground circle, give us a sign, so we can proclaim our love and loyalty to you! I don't know about this. Dammit, this shit is really freaking me out. - Zack! - I'm on it! You know what's causing it to choke? Uh, no, not really. Genny looks like it's got plenty of gas, - so, I mean, that's not it. - Hmm. Tell you what, will you hold in that button - right there? - Holding. All right. Nice! I guess we make a great team. Yeah. I think we do, too. - Y'all are so adorable. - Robin! Dude, you're asking for it. Sorry, Liz. We'll-- we'll cut this out. Right, Trevor? Hey, do not try and put this off on me. Put what off? There's nothin' to put off. - We're gonna cut it out. - Okay. Whatever you say, bro. Oh, great Lucifer, if you are here with us in this place of your tramping ground, give us a sign, so we can proclaim our love and loyalty to you. Nothing. Thankfully. Geez, Ginger. I think we need to introduce a physical medium. Wha-- No, no, no, no, no. I don't know about this. Yeah, Ginger, I've had some bad experiences with spirit boards. Come on, guys, what-- none of this is real, so why get all tweaked over it? Everyone needs to move closer. Put their fingers on the planchette. Planchette? Cool word. I used to just call it a pointer. You guys know that spirit boards are connected to demonic possessions... right? Dude, just chill. We're just trying to have some fun, brother. You're one of the good ones, Robert. You have nothing to worry about. Dear Lucifer. Rebel, warrior, and ruler of the great abyss. If you are here, show us your presence. We have come here to seek you out. Are we here in vain? One of you is moving it. And how will we be doing that? You would be able to tell, don't you think? Guys, it just spelled out Satan! You guys are lame. I was moving it the whole time. Did you do that, too? Guys... we made contact. This is a breakthrough, we... we need to go further. No, we don't. That's far enough for me. I'm with Kelly. We need to end this. This place is evil. We need to just pack our bags, and-- and go home. There is nothing to be gained from staying here any longer. Look at ol' Robert. Trying to team up with my girl and spoil a good time. What is wrong with you, Drew? Wha-- nothing, babe, wha-- I'm just trying to have some fun tonight, so-- so why do you two keep on trying to ruin it? And cut! - All right. - Yay! - Nice. - Zack, Liz, good job. - That was beautiful! - Hey, Veasna. Can we check playback to make sure it was good -as we think it was? -Yeah. Sure. Yeah. -Yeah, are we movin' on? -Moving on. Okay, guys, that is lunch. We got food and drinks set up at base camp. Actors, please, front of the line, thank you. Technically, this should be second lunch, okay? We've been workin' since 10 a.m.! Yeah, well, technically, this ain't a union show, if it were, I'd be fired. So, cut the chatter, eat your lunch, man, 'cause we gotta get back in to finish this bad boy. At the stroke of midnight. - Ooh! - Yeah, ooh! That's right, please, go eat, guys. Thank you. So, Jimmy, what's next? We're almost to the end, and I don't know where this is going. Yeah, uh, just give me a second. I want to go talk to Willow. Talk to Willow? What about me? I'm the director, I don't even know what the next scene is! I just want to make sure we can do the beginning before I tell you. It involves special effects makeup and stuff. I'll be right back. Can you believe this shit? Yeah. I believe it. People just aren't trustworthy. Or perceptive. Hey, Dante. Um, I just wanted to let you know... Hey, Dante, would you like to maybe go on-- in the woods with me? Oh, my God. Hey. Do you like what you see? Hey, Willow, you in here? Yeah. Yes, I'm just doing some makeup tests. -What's up? -That hair stuff is nice. -Um. -Thanks. Do you have any of those knives, you know, the ones with, like, the retractable blades and such? Oh, yeah. Yes, I do. Here, take your pick. Some are, uh, some are rubber, some are plastic, some are retractable and some are real. Wow, holy shit, Willow, that's awesome. - Thank you. - Yeah. Fuckin' argue in front of the crew, but what, you're not gonna eat your food? I'm not flippin' hungry. I don't wanna eat. Dude, why are you fuckin' doin' this, bitch. Man, just shut the fuck up. I don't have a fucking script to work with! Fuck the fucking script, you have the fucking note, man. What the fuck do you want me to do, man? Jonah, Jonah, Jonah, Jonah. Hey. What's up, man? Fuckin' sick of you. Wow! Okay. So now you gonna tell the ending? Yes. -Hey, Trevor. -'Sup, dude. Hey, guys, just gettin' some B-roll for the doc. Trev, Trev, Trev, Trev, Trev, Trev, Trev. Hey,. Hey, had to show you something. Beyond the air tent. Right now. Come with me. All right, dude. So I was downloading the-- the camera, the-- the verité footage. I was skimmin' through it. I found somethin'. Like, some paranormal shit? Dude. Not quite. Check this out. You hid a cam in their tent, too? What the fuck, Robin? How many GoPros did you hide? No, dude, this is-- this is about what they did. You need to just stop, man. All right? You're goin' too far with this spying stuff. And yeah, what the fuck were those guys thinking? Like, I guess if I was Drew I might try the same thing, but still. Yeah. It's fucked up, dude. She cheated on her boyfriend. All while he was directing her in a scene, and he didn't even know about it. Seriously sneaky. -Yeah, it's sleazy, too, right? -Yeah. Everyone's starting to act a little weird. Interesting. Why do you say that? Like, you know, more emotional? Like, meaner? Haven't you noticed? Oh. Hey, Willow. How are you doing? Hey, Dante. I'm good, I'm just... Keep rolling man, keep rolling. - ...really tired. - Yeah, no, they've been working us like dogs out here. Yeah, I know. -Um, wait, Dante. -Yeah? I want to talk to you about something, but I don't really know how to say it. Well, I mean... it's just us in here, so why don't you just say it? Um. Oh, uh... I think you're hot. You do? I do. God, I've wanted to tell you for so long, and I didn't really know how you felt about me, I just-- I want to-- I-- I-- would you like to have sex with me? I mean, I-- I think you're pretty cute, Willow. -Even a bit sexy. -Thank you. But... those cuts on your arm are so damn unattractive. I mean, look, I'm 22 years old, and I'm about to head to the prime of my life, and the last thing I need is someone with that kind of baggage, I-- I... Right? Can-- do you-- No. Wow. You see what I mean? That was really cold! Yeah, dude. I think he's goin', let's go! Hey, guys. Hey, Willow. What were you doing back there? Uh, we were just wanderin' around, enjoying the woods. We didn't hear anything. Yeah, and even if we did, we'd edit it out. Right, Robin? Yeah, well, we didn't, so it's not gonna be a thing, Trevor. Let's go. Oh, looks like there's a little second unit on the way. Cut! That's great. Let's get ready for the campfire scene. How are we lookin', Jake? Uh, looking good. Picture's up in five, last looks. Shouldn't you be writing? Yeah. Last looks. Lunch is over, Willow! I'm sorry, Jonah. I'm sorry. You feelin' okay, honey? Yeah, I'm okay. Okay, I'm trying to stay in character. Yes, ma'am. Come on, Willow. Okay, picture's up! All right, roll sound! - Sound's speeding. - Roll camera. Set. And action! Hey, guys. Found it. Nice going, dude. Yeah, It caught some major air. It was, like, 50 feet in the woods, back that way. Do we really wanna try this again? I don't. Seriously? I just spent half an hour looking for that thing. It's just that this isn't the first time that crazy stuff has happened to me while messing with spirit boards. Yeah? So? Yeah, we're just having a little bit of fun. Right, guys? Fuck yeah. I love this shit! Me too. Okay, guys, this is not going to work unless we all want it to. Let's test this crazy legend once and for all. Father of Darkness, we can feel your presence with us tonight. It is the midnight hour. Your hour of tramping. If you are indeed with us, give us a sign. Then, stake your claim, and take us for your own! Whoa, nice. That book is wicked. Like you are, Andrew. Wicked indeed. And unholy. What are you two so scared about? This is awesome! Fear of the unknown is a big thing in conformist societies. There is nothing mysterious about what you are trying to do here, Ginger. It's unholy, and quite frankly... I don't want any part of it! Oh, no! Robert doesn't approve, it's unholy. It is. And to sit here, and watch you practically beg Satan to come, and take your soul away, it's revolting. And I will not be a part of it anymore. You know what I find revolting? People... who make promises, and go back on their word for selfish reasons. If I made an oath to my Lord and Savior, and then, broke that covenant for a mere 20 seconds of pleasure, I might feel pretty bad about myself. And I might also think that my Lord would be angry with me, and no longer want to be my Savior. Wait, did you guys have sex? You can call it that. I've had car accidents that lasted longer. Wow, you are not a good person. Oh, come on, Kelly. Never said I was. Whatever, guys, can we just get back to the séance, now, please? Great warrior, ruler of the abyss, light in the darkness, creator of true freedom, release us from convention, conformity, morality, make our souls yours. And by your power... I have an offering. Take this failed attempt of a priest. This oath-breaker. 'Cause not just this evening, he broke his oath with the Lamb. And is no longer in His good graces! Help me! ...Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary. Please pray for us sinners, now, and at the time of our death. Amen! Great job, guys! Next shot, grand finale. Willow, I need you to work that magic. - Okay. Thank you. - Awesome. You got this, girl. Okay? Let's go. Hey, Kelly, will you come with me real quick? I gotta change a battery in your pack. Copy that. Interesting. Um, so, does it bother you that the Holy Bible says it's a crime against God to be a homosexual? It might. If I believed in the Holy Bible. But I don't. 'Cause it never believed in me. Well, there are therapies for that. Okay. Drew's all done, I'm going for a walk. Hey, man. Willow's headin' out for a walk. Let's follow her from a distance. You mean spy on her? Yes, dammit. I mean to spy on her, that's the style of film we're making. Don't you get that? Yeah. I get it. Turn the light off. Turn the light off. I can't believe I've let you bring me down to this level. What level? Dude. Trevor. Come on. This shit is gonna be brilliant, man. We already fucking shot two sex scenes already. We could make a porno if we wanted to. I thought you said we were gonna edit all that stuff out. Yeah, we will. I was just kidding about the pornos. I'm goin' back to set. Yeah. Okay, copy that. I'll meet you there. I'm gonna go take a leak. She has a nice setup, don't want it to all be-- Jonah. Jimmy. Dudes. Oh, fuck. I got so much-- I got a question. What gives? Okay, so... say you have a friend, you know, and that friend's wife or girlfriend did somethin' to hurt somebody, okay? And at the same time, they're getting majorly betrayed, okay? Would you just sit back, and let it happen, or would you tell 'em? What are you saying, man? Okay, so, as a director, right, you'll-- you'll get this. Um, I'm making my documentary in like a cinema verité style, you know, like-- ultrarealistic and uncoached. I'm familiar with the style. Right, right, I-- I figured you would be, okay? So, um, in doing that, I-- I planted some, you know, verité cams around, you know, base camp to get some hidden footage. What? Dude, you've been spying on us? -That's ridiculous. -I understand why. Go on. I accidentally found somethin' I feel like you need to be made aware of. Fuck. Oh, God. Okay, here it is. There's more. There's more. And this one. You think this is funny? No. No, I was-- You motherfucker! I bet you're smiling 'cause you wanna do the exact same thing! I know. I-- I know. I know. I know. I know. Hey, who are you taking to, Willow? Don't you see it? In the fire? All I see is fire. I also remember how you tried to steal Jennifer when... Yo. Did you show Jonah those-- those videos? Yeah. Right, well, if they ask me, I know nothing about your hidden spy cams. Yeah. Okay, Trevor, I get it. Officially under the bus. You've hit me with it, like, twice already. From the beginning of this, I asked you to tone down all the sex stuff, but you wouldn't listen! Writing all this sex stuff with Kelly is probably what caused this shit to even happen! You are a treacherous fuckhead! Oh, fuck. Places, everyone! Let's finish this fucking thing! Um... yeah, you heard the guy. Picture's up in five. Get your marks. What the fuck is goin' on, bro? -Get the fuck away from me. -Fuck, man, fuck you. Jimmy, what the fuck is his problem, bro? Such a lovely name. Ginger. I can almost taste you. It is my honor to serve you, great prince. How shall I reward thee for such a ripe offering? Nothing. Nothing is expected, dear Satan. Ginger, what the hell is wrong with you? Why do you say it like that? Hell is such a magical place. Robert, can you hear me? Kelly! I betrayed my Lord and Savior. And broke my sacred oath. This is the only way that I can win this fight. Oh, you won, Robert. Too bad you're dead. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can take whoever I want, whenever I want. Let me go! You've been trying to stop us all night. You killed my cousin! Actually, he killed himself, didn't he? You bitch! Fuckin' bitch! I-- you really stabbed me. Hey, what the fuck just happened? What the fuck did you do? I'm right here, baby. Zack! Put on this fucking light! This is fucked up, work! I triple-checked the knife. I-- I know it was the right one. I love you, baby. I'm sorry, babe, I checked it three times. Hey, what the fuck? What the fuck is wrong-- Someone must have switched it. Someone must have switched it. Someone must have switched the knife-- That's two. What the fuck is goin' on? What the fuck, dude? What the fuck? She was fucking just there. She was just there. She was there. She was just there. She was just there. Where did she go? She snapped. This is all too much for her. She needs help. Willow, it's okay. Okay? Are you nuts? She just murdered Kelly and probably Ginger. Jonah, Jonah, Jonah. Judas, this is all your fault! Hey, hey, wait, we're not trying to hurt you. Jonah! Motherfucker! This is all your fault! Perverted fucking asshole! Kelly's dead. the blood is everywhere! Hey, man, look, look. You're gonna kill him. You're gonna kill him. All right? You're gonna fucking kill him. Just fuck-- fuck, man. What the-- ugh. Motherfucker! Hey, enough! All right? - This is all my fault. - This is all my fault. Look-- look, everyone. We need to take a moment, and let our cooler heads prevail. And all I can say is I know Jonah just found out that Kelly was cheatin' on him with Drew, so his was a crime of passion. - Oh, God. Jonah! - Jonah! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What the fuck, Willow! There's fucking knives flying everywhere. - What the fuck is this shit? - The fuck is going on? Oh, my God. What the-- the fuck. Fucking... Did you find one yet? - Mine's real. - What? You had no right to kill Liz! She was beautiful! Gonna fucking kill you! Fuck. Sorry, Trev. I-- I've got this demon! - What do we do, Robin? - I don't know, man! No, demon! Begone, bitch! Why did you do that? I told him we'd meet in hell. But he wasn't listening. You once told me that you would cut yourself to draw out the pain. But I didn't really know what that was like. Until now. Goodbye. Fuck. Chatham County 911, what's the address of your emergency?
