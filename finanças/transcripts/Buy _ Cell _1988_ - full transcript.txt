[WIND BLOWING] REPORTER: Hopefully, a summit as early as next August. And in Wall Street this morning, the market nosedived a hundred and forty points, making this the largest plunge since the October crash. Some of our biggest investment houses will now have to step back and closely re-examine their operations. That means trouble on the Street, big trouble. And in baseball today, the good news is the trade between the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Peter O'Malley said today in a press conference... [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] [GRUNTS] Damn it. [PANTING] Good. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] No, Reggie, you son of a bitch. You can't make me do it. [GRUNTS] [GUNSHOT] [BULLET RICOCHETING] [GASPS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Shit. ATTORNEY: Then you did know the deceased? Know him? Not only was he a trusted employee, he was a close, personal friend. Remind me to send some money to his widow. I am Mr. Forsythe's, Attorney. Can I be of any help? Do you have any idea why the deceased took his own life? -Well, as a matter fact-- -Well, I don't think we -[INDISTINCT] ---I think there were-- -none. -None. DISPATCH: Unit 80 responding to 10-4. WOMAN: Negative, Unit 80. 10-4. Thank you, gentlemen. That'll be all for now. WOMAN: 1-5 [INDISTINCT] party in progress. MAN: Okay. We're through here, eh. Uh, you wanna get the door for me, please? MAN: Yeah, hang on a sec. ♪ Pa, pa-ra-ra, pa, pa-ra♪ [BEEPS] Tada. [LAUGHTER] ARTHUR: Tada. Not so quick. It's my considered legal opinion that Malcolm's death still leaves you up Shit's Creek. -Oh. -Unfortunately, the asshole killed himself before you completed putting your files into his computer. Oh, come on, Arthur. I still have problems. About 26, all of them charges being filed by the SEC. I'm afraid you lost your patsy a little too soon. [SIGHS] Arthur. Let's not forget, I made a hundred and eighty-five million dollars for the company and twenty-five million in cash for us. And we're talking a glorious future here of sun and surf and sex. Beautiful. But I'm talking a painful future of bars, chains, and romantic involvements with guys doing 25 for life. And we're still in trouble. I just said that. Hmm. Do you think Mother knows anything? Oh, Reggie. Grow up. She's a crappy old fox. She'll never put anything over on her, not for long. I think you got to find yourself another poor guy, and fast. [SIGHS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Don't worry, Arthur. I already have. Me? Well, I just don't know what to say. Well, life can be so unpredictable. My God, look what happened to poor old Malcolm last night. It was a horrible thing, just horrible. I'll miss him more than you'll ever know. -[SOBS] -[CLEARS THROAT] Herbie, effective immediately... you're taking over Malcolm's account. Every last client. Congratulations, Mr. Junior Partner. Junior Partner? I really do not know what to say. Welcome aboard, partner. You're part of our little family now. [LAUGHTER] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Meat delivered. Move it, asshole. I must be dreaming. Well, time to wake up, convict. And welcome to Evensong Prison. [KNOCKS ON DOORS] WARDEN: Come in. MAN: Well, he's all yours. Mr. Altman, sit down, make yourself comfortable. Certainly is an honor having a man of your stature in my prison, a 13-year sentence, 200 million-dollar fine. [SCOFFS] I'm very impressed. Well, I'm very innocent. Really? That's the first time anyone ever said that to me. You've got a fair trial, didn't you? The recess lasted longer than my whole fair trial. Mr. Altman, I know you've got your problems, but please, try to imagine my problems. I've been sentenced here too, you know. I'm doing hard time just like the rest of you. I've been judged guilty of being an excellent leader of men. And I've been sentenced to a cruel life with murderers, rapists, bank robbers, scum of the earth, these are the kind of people I have to break bread with. Now I meet an inside trader, embezzler, a man who's reached the pinnacle of white-collar crime. Herbie, if I may call you Herbie? Yes, sir. It's an honor and a privilege to have you as a guest in my home for the next 13 years. And maybe we could get together sometime, talk about the market. I have a unique interest in the world of high finance. Perhaps, we could discuss a few lucrative investments. [SNIFFING] [SNEEZES LOUDLY] It's okay. Have you got a cold? It's actually an allergy. Every time I hear the "I" word, I just... Huh, the "I" word? Yeah. The "I" word, you know, invest. [SNIFFING] [SNEEZES] Yeah, sometimes. [LAUGHS] Come on, Herbie. -Uh... -Come on, you're putting me on, huh? -No. -The "I" word? Yeah. -Thank you. -Yeah. The "I" word. [SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] -Invest? -[SNIFFS] Invest. [SNEEZES LOUDLY] Gesundheit. you know, Herbie, maybe I can help you. -Uh-hmm. -It may be very therapeutic, a few successful investments. [SNEEZES] Mr. Wolf, show the prisoner to his cell. [CHAINS RATTLING] WARDEN: Mr. Wolf... according to my files, that man made a great deal of money for his company. I want that kind of knowledge making money for me. Yes, sir. [DOOR CLOSES] Hey, 13 years, when do I really get out? With good behavior? Yeah. Thirteen years. Welcome to Cell Block D. [CROWD CHATTER] WARDEN: Good evening, scum. -MAN: I love you. -WARDEN: We have a new prisoner in D Block, Mr. Herbie Altman, and we're very fortunate to have him. PRISONER: Warden must like you boy. PRISONER: Howdy. PRISONER: I like the way you walk, sweetie. -Come in here, baby. -PRISONER: Come on. PRISONER: Look what I got for you, baby. Come to mama. [MAN HUMMING] Hey! Wolf-man, what the hell's going out there, man? Hell, I'm your new dating service, boy. Meet your roommate. I thought we had a deal, man! I told you, nobody getting the cell but me! Ain't you heard, they overcrowded in the present state, it's terrible. [GUFFAWS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Whoa! Wait a second. Here it is. Here it is. Hey, Kareem is bouncing the ball, and he throws to Magic, Magic takes the ball, he shoots, and score! [MAKES SOUND] And the Lakers are up by 10! Fourth quarter! [MAKES SOUND] Lakers up by 10, huh? I feel lucky in that. Double my bet. You're on, brother. If Houston wins, I'll be back and I get my money. [LAUGHS] His money is Benito, gone, hasta la bye-bye, done for, you dig? The name is Sylvester Swarm, but my friends call me The Sly. This has got to be a nightmare. Yeah, dream my ass. Sit your butt down. I'm sorry about your head, brother. You know something, I can tell that you have no means of measuring those precious days, and hours as they melt the hell away. So dig, what I got here, I got watches, man. I got Swiss, I got Japanese, date, time, day, I can see in three different time zones, pressure up to four and a half atmospheres, you understand? You want some shoes, I got your Reeboks, I got your Converse, I got your Adidas, I got everything in the tennis shoe department, you dig what I'm saying, brother man? All right. Let me show you what else we got over here. We've got all kinds of stuff, cigarettes, you want filter, non-filter, low-tar, high-tar, low-tar, tar-tar, whoever that cares, man. I got all kinds of stuff for you, brother man! Really expensive and I got the best rates in the joint, you understand? Now, you like stereo equipment? With speakers, without speakers, with beer, in fact, you can even have beer with no speakers, you want music to go with the beer to go with your speakers, man? I got everything. I got Whitney Houston, I got Stevie Wonder, I got Stevie Winwood, I got A-ha and the opening act, hee-hee. You want fruits? I got all kinds of strawberry nectar, I got strawberries maraschino cherries, olives, and everything including an ear of corn from the place every once in a while, you dig what I'm saying? Now,[INDISTINCT] hey, man, you like sports? Of course, you like sports, you got to like sports. I have the biggest and widest selection of sportswear there is in the joint. You like the Lakers, you got the Lakers. You like Boston? You go Boston, you like New York, you got New York. I can provide anything you want in sports uniform, I can get it in special orders. Now, I can get you anything in this place, but to get out of here. [CHUCKLES] Hmm. I tell you, you're gonna be a problem, man, so we're gonna have to get the ground rules straight. Rules? -That's right, man. That couch you're sitting on is gonna cost you 75 cents a night. You wanna use that pillow, it's gonna cost you another 50 cents a night. You wanna use that toiletry in peak hours, it's gonna cost you one dollar. Non-peak hours, 40 cents. And right now, you just happen to owe me $10. For what? Rent. Oh, wait a second! Here comes, here comes the Flash, Kareem throws, he throws to Magic, Magic-- oh, no, he lost to the game. Oh, shit! No! They lost! I don't believe it! How could you lose! Oh, fuck! Ow! Man, how could you lose? How could they do this? Oh, no! Now! Oh. [GRUNTING] Lakers couldn't lose, huh? [GRUNTING] I'll get your money. I'll get your money tomorrow, man. -I-- -You get my money, you'll get all of my money or I'll cut your nuts off for earrings, you got that? [GASPS] [CLEARS THROAT] Can you believe that, newbie? The Lakers lost. Oh. Man, I don't know what your day has been like, but mine's been a bitch! Oh! [MAKES SOUND] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, God. I'm never gonna get out of this nightmare alive. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I thought you made license plates here? Oh, well, in the past we got some real problems, man. I know you think is a dream, but you got to wake up and die right, you understand? You are in prison, stick with the program. The warden is a killer. He sold all the machines in the machine shop. He sold all the wood in the woodshop. He sold all the tools in the tool shop. -Why? -Why? Oh, shit! Why? Because he's figured we're coming back anyway, so why waste your time teaching us a trade? That would make you a pro. Right. Now you got it, brother. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] This isn't nutritious. In order to survive, a person needs a healthy, well-balanced diet. What makes you think the warden wants us to survive, hmm? Look, a halfway-decent meal would have protein and fiber. Uh-hmm. Oh, tell me, Shaka, brother. Hmm. You want fiber? Yeah. Duke. Get these ladies some fiber. There, now you got your fucking fiber. Now you move your ass so these people can eat. And I'll take care of your ass later. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Get my food, Duke. [GRUNTS] Who was that? [SIGHS] Rule number one. Don't ask questions. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hi. Hi. Bye. -Bye. -Hi, bye, hi, bye, hi, bye, hi. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] How you doing? Fine. You're new here, I'm Tony, 'kay? Hi, Tony. I'm Herbie. I'm innocent. I swear it's true, okay? I'm innocent. I mean, like, I don't really belong here, you know. Oh, it's such a relief. I mean, you know, to find somebody that understands, because I--I'm innocent, too. My trial is a complete sham. -Really? -Yeah. Well, maybe you could talk to Marco and tell them I didn't do it, okay? -To Marco? -Yeah. He wants to kill me because of what he thought I did, see, but I didn't do it, I'm innocent, you know, right? [CHUCKLES] Okay, well, where's Marco? He's around here. Son of a bitch! Did you see him? See who? Tony! That dirty stole-y, he squealed on me! Went to the cops, told them everything! That's why I'm in here. -Tony, I thought you... -Hey! I'm not Tony, you asshole! I'm Marco! -You're Marco? -That's right! And when I find Tony, I'm gonna slash his freaking throat! And if you want him, if you want him, you understand me? If you want him, there's a piece of blame for you too, right? Right? I mean, if somebody messes with me, I mess with him, all right? Somebody steals from me, I don't walk over and say you just spit on the sidewalk, right? Right! Don't mess with me, all right? Bye! Bye. Bye. Bye! Bye. Bye! Bye. Bye! [SIGHS] Bye. Hi. Bye. Bye. Hey, man. [SIGHS] So you enjoy your first meal, man? Hey, who is that guy? That was VCR. Pretty normal cat, though, about three years ago. He actually peed on the warden. The warden got so pissed off so to speak that he shoved his ass in the hole for five months, man. By the time that cat came out, he thought he was a videotape masseur. [GROANING] Made it, Ma! Top of the world! [GRUNTING] Get me out of here! [GRUNTING] Get off! [GRUNTING] Get, [GRUNTING] get him off! Yo, Eddie! Eddie, Eddie! [GRUNTING] So, at last we meet, Robin Hood. [MAKES SOUND] ow! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] Hi. Bye. [GRUNTING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Hi, bye, hi, bye, bye. Sorry, look, about the money... Shh. No talking. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Morning, scum. Is anyone looking for trouble today? No, sir. I said, is anyone looking for trouble today? No, sir. WARDEN: Very, very good. Very good. By the way. I hope everyone is making Mr. Altman feel welcome. Stand up, Mr. Altman, say hello. I said stand up. Thank you. You may sit down. Stand up, Mr. Swan. You know how I like to keep my prison clean and tidy, Mr. Swan. I like for you scum to see the value of a pristine world. And yet, I found this in your cell today. [SIGHS] WARDEN: What is that, Mr. Swan? Well, look here, Warden, I know I've been in prison a long time, but that sure looks like a woman to me! [GRUNTS] WARDEN: Cleanliness, Mr. Swan, cleanliness. Keep your home morally sound, spotlessly clean. You may resume eating, gentlemen. Thank you. [GATE CLOSES] [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Woo. So, what are you in for, exactly? Exactly? Yeah. IRS sting operation. Took some of the best people and nailed my butt. Me and Al Capone, all of the hard cases, you dig? Yeah. Understand this stake, you gots to keep your eyes open, that's the key to survival around here. -HERBIE: Right. -Uh-hmm. Hey. -Hey. -Hey. Hey. -Hey. -Hey. Oh, come on, Sly. The general surgeon has determined that smoking can be very hazardous to your health. Hey. -Hey. -Hey. Besides, today's your lucky day. It is? I'm gonna shorten your sentence. Well, how are you gonna do that, baby? Easy, baby. I'm gonna kill you. Hey. -Hey. -Hey. -Hey. -Hey. [GRUNTS] Hey. No, scumbag. I'm gonna kill him. Watch your fat mouth, Tarzan. Mr. Chocolate here lost the game last night. He owes us some ducats. He owes me money, too. So, I'll kill him first and you can kill him later. [GRUNTS] Put his ass down, white meat, or I'm gonna take yours. Excuse me. I really wish you guys wouldn't fight over like this. -Shut up. -Shut up Okay. Okay. Listen guys, you know, I don't think violence really ever solve anything so-- No? Wanna bet? [YELLS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC] Are you all right? HERBIE: Yeah. WARDEN: Of course, he's all right. You're all right, aren't you, Herbie? Yes, sir. What a brave fellow. Come with me. I took the liberty of ordering you a newspaper. I thought we could go through the goal futures together. Gesundheit. [SNEEZES] WARDEN: Ms. Scott. I think you're in debt, Mr. Swan. Hope you make it through the day. Charming. [LAUGHTER] Gentlemen. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Ooga-ooga. [LAUGHTER] Gentlemen. [LAUGHTER] I want you to feel free to say what's ever on your mind. [LAUGHTER] Pipe down. Mr. Wolf, let them speak. These assholes have no manners! [SNARLS] Watch your mouth, boy. -[GROWLS] -And you sit your big ass down now! Mr. Wolf, that'll be all. That'll be all? I'm gonna be fine. WOLF: Okay, carrot top, it's your funeral! Hi, bye! [LAUGHTER] Hey, send a postcard, cabron. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [LAUGHTER] DR. SCOTT: Gentlemen. Gentlemen, I'm a psychologist. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] All, right. Yo, baby. [INDISTINCT] Isn't the whole idea of this thing to say whatever's on your mind? All right. I--I'm innocent. And who the fuck cares? I do. That's why I'm here. Prisons all over this country are starting to provide this kind of counseling. And I think this is-- institution should keep up with that modern penal phisopholy--philosophy. Well, sweetheart, I got some penis philosophy for you, huh? Oh, no, no, no. Forget Fatso's philosophy. I got you the real thing right here, mama. Hey, isn't anybody gonna help her? There's sweet little coochie you, huh? Rule number four, don't get involved. You dig? Hey, what are you do-- what are you doing? -Don't get involved. -Uh, Cowboy? Raoul? Look, guys, everybody knows that in prison, sexual tension is overwhelming, so, uh-- so what if there's a beautiful woman there? Look, why don't you guys just try to control your hormones, all right? And show her a sense of dignity and decorum? Didn't we tell this fuck to shut up? We will. [GRUNTS] No, Cowboy. Cowboy, put him down. -Huh? -Sarge. Yo, man, you put--you put-- -um, nice arm, brother. -Oh, thank you very much. -Now put that shank down now. -Yeah? Be glad to. [SCREAMS] HERBIE: [SCREAMS] -[SIGHS] -Wrong move, sucker. [MAKES SOUNDS] Now, what you got to say about that? [GROANS] Causing trouble again, Altman? Well, not really. I was just trying to... [GROANS] Interesting story here on fossil fuel investments. [SNEEZES] -Ow. -In the box. Ten days. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] You see, Ms. Scott, they're scum, garbage. That's the kind of people we're dealing with here. Well, obviously, I don't agree. You're here to watch how absolute power controls crime. Brute force keeps these men in line, not Freud and Jung. Warden, I don't think the answer is force. I think we should be concerned with the conditions here. I mean, do you know what the recidivism rate is? Seven out of ten convicts come back to this prison. Doesn't that bother you? Of course, it does. It means three of those scumbags are still out on the streets. Doesn't that bother you? Good day, Ms. Scott. Good luck. You're in luck, hand job. The new shrink wants to see you. Mr. Altman? Um, I just wanna tell you I'm really sorry about what happened today. I feel like it was my fault that you're in solitary. It isn't. Well, I feel that way. And I just wanna thank you for coming to my aid. I mean... WARDEN: Visiting hours are over, Ms. Scott. I wanna talk to him, Warden. He's my patient. He's my prisoner, and I do not permit house calls. DR. SCOTT: If you force me, I'm going to report this to the review board. [CHUCKLES] Well, you do whatever you have to do. I run this prison, not the board. Mr. Wolf. Pleasant dreams, Herbie. I hope you come to your senses soon. Most people go a little mad in this sweatbox. Thanks, Wolf. Yo, what's happening? Hmm. God, Sly. What happened to you? A slight disagreement with my creditors. You look bad. Yeah, well, I doubt your mug could win a prize either. [CHUCKLES] Hey, how much do you owe those guys anyhow? [CLEARS THROAT] Twenty five thousand dollars. Goddamn. Isn't that great? -Twenty-five grand? -Uh-hmm. How are ever gonna pay that back? Afford them a plan, man. A dollar a month for the next twenty-five thousand months. [CHUCKLES] WOLF: Guess what? Warden wants to make sure you got plenty of "I" word material. [LAUGHS] Yo, Herbie, what's the "I" word, man? [SIGHS] Invest. [SNEEZES] That's why I call it the "I" word. Every time I say it, that happens. That's it. Ow. [CLEAR THROAT] Look here. [GROANS] Look here, man. You gots to do the "I" word for me. Now, come on, man. You gots to do it, man. Not for the warden, man. For me, man. You're the "I" word for me, 'cause if you don't do the "I" word for me, then one them brothers, like Shaka or Raoul and Cowboy, they're gonna kill me. You understand? And then you're gonna get a new cellmate, man. And he's gonna love talking to you to bed at night, you know? -Man. -You know what I'm saying? So you gots to do it for me, man. [SIGHS] How are you gonna get your hands on some money? I need some cash. You got to get me at least two grand. You get two grand, I can add "I" it and make twenty-five just like that. The Sly shall provide. He sure will. [SIGHS] [LAUGHS] You want-- you want me to do what? I want you to get your hands on $2,000, man. [LAUGHTER] Hey. Why? [LAUGHS] Because $2,000 will get you $20,000 in two weeks' time. Oh. Oh. Really? Come on, Wolf man. I know half the cons in the joint owe you money, man. All you got to do is collect. So chicken shit here can spend it? SLY: Hey, man. He was an "I" word banker. He don't do the "I" word. The warden's been trying to get him to do that since he got here. I won't do the "I" word for the warden, but I'll do it for Sly. And for you, Wolf. You will do that for me? Absolutely. [GROANS] Is he shitting me? No way, Wolf man. Besides, you can't lose. The price of your stock goes up, all you do is collect your money like broker's commission. And what if it goes down? You got a special this week, man. You get all my hustling services free for the next five years. [LAUGHS] No. If it goes down, you go down forever. You're actually gonna kill him, Wolf? [LAUGHING] I don't know what'll give me more pleasure, 20 grand or tearing your throat out. [CLEARS THROAT] You can tear his throat out. -What? -[LAUGHS] Thanks. [GROANS] [LAUGHS] Now, you got a deal. [LAUGHS] DR. SCOTT: Warden. Warden. I've been studying the transcripts of Mr. Altman's trial. Warden, I really think-- [PANTS] Warden. Don't. Piss off. You owe me money. But if you invest with this man, you';; make double your coin. You already doubled the double. A simple no would have sufficed, Cowboy. Are you looking for any trouble today, Mr. Altman? Uh...no, sir, Warden. No, he is not. [GROANS] I said, are you looking for any trouble today? No, sir. WARDEN: Good. Yes, sir, I am. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] What did you say? I said I am. It might interest to you, Warden, that I sent for a copy of the Annual State Prison budget. That's public information, sir. It's available upon request. -Really? -HERBIE: Yeah. And in my reading, I found that Evensong Prison has an annual food budget of 3.7 million dollars. That's fascinating. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Especially, after you do a little calculating. In the three months period, you've spent less than $482,000. In a year, that's gonna be over million and a half dollars -unaccounted for. -[CHUCKLES] Are you suggesting any impropriety? It's not a suggestion. Good. Well, since we're all having open forum, any more complains? SLY: He's insane, Warden. The slammer just made him a little crazy. I know exactly what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. I have another complain. Why don't you give me the man in this prison just a little bit of respect so that maybe we can avoid coming back here? [GROANS] Thank you, Mr. Muncy. Don't ruffle your petticoats, Ms. Scott. Any more complain? You see, gentlemen, what we have here is the ability to communicate. [CHUCKLES] Absolute power, not psychology, that's what rules. Come on, Herbie. Let's go. Goddamn, Muncy. -Yeah. -Well, I hear you're trying to raise some money. Yeah. Count me in for 50 bucks. Okay, Tony. Hey. Hey. Did that asshole Tony give you 50 bucks? -Yes, he did. -Did he do that? -Yes. -Did he do that? Well, count me in for 50. Okay, Mark. Hey, count us all in for 50. All right. You guys are in. What are you guys doing? Raising money [GROANS] to cut inherent justice of our modern penal system. Well, count me in for $25. Dr. Scott. Let me get this straight. You got my money, and you want me to help you raise money, so you can pay me back my money? I must be a fucking idiot. Count me in. Okay, Cowboy. Tarzan. You really surprise me. It takes a lot of cohones to admit that you're an idiot. But if he's got enough cohones to admit that he's an idiot, then I've got enough cohones to admit I'm an idiot too. Count me in. -[MAKES SOUND] -Okay, Raoul. -Hey. -[GROWLS] I am in... ...too. Okay, Duke. Okay. Yeah. I'm in. You wanna run that by me again, Brother Shaka? You heard me, brother. I said I'm in. You got balls, white boy. I like that. The way you stood up to the warden, balls. Of course now, if you lose our money, I'm gonna cut your balls off and stick them up Sly's ass. -Agreed? -Agreed. I ain't talking to you, Sly man. Agreed? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Good. My kind of people. Now get on it. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I've got the stock. I've got the stock. I've got the stock. I think we should buy. Peach Computer? -I don't understand. -All right. You said you're going to New York tomorrow, right? -Yeah. -It's simple. We need your help. Yes, Dr. Scott, all of us. Twinkles, you just got to help us. Uh-hmm. Ma'am, you're the only one we got. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Yeah. You got to do it. We'd like you to open an account in the House of Forsythe. -Do it. -Don't do it. -Do it. -Don't do it. You used to work there, didn't you? Yeah. And we need you to buy some shares in Peach Computer. [SIGHS] Herbie, I don't think this is in keeping with the doctor-patient relationship. Dr. Scott, if you don't do it for me, do it for the cons. Well, how much money are you gonna invest? [CHUCKLES] Twenty five thousand. I don't know. [CHUCKLES] This is out of my authority. I mean, I don't even know where you got this money. Good morning. I'd be glad to help you, Miss... Scott. Ellen Scott. Oh, good that it's Miss? Wonderful. I'll be handling your account personally. Well, thank you, Mr. Forsythe. Please. It's Reggie. Reggie IV. Now, how do you want this handled, Ms. Scott? Ellen. -Ellen. -Well, I represent an account that will be dealing in cash, -for now. -Oh. And the name of the account? Con Inc. REGGIE: Con Inc. It's a utilities account, I suppose? No. It's more like an institutional account. Oh. Good.[LAUGHS] I like doing business with a respectable and established firm. So do I. Hmm. MAN [OVER TELEVISION]: Look for the symbol of your independent agent through the yellow pages. You're more than one company agent. MAN [OVER TELEVISION]: Good morning. Welcome to Wall Street Today. Stock market opens slightly higher today on news of declining interest rates. [CHEERING] This computer certainly is the stock to watch. Some say their company is on the verge of a major breakthrough. [CHEERING] MAN [OVER TV]: But there are also rumors that the dynamic president of Beige Computer maybe leaving the company soon. Those rumors maybe reflected in today's figure. IBM, up two points. Beige Computer, down nine. MAN [OVER TELEVISION]: Just given the taste -of Alka-Seltzer... -Guys, look, these things happen. Uh, well, see, we call it ebb and flow. Ebb and flow this. -Later. -Son of a bitch. What? I told you not to mess with my money. [SCREAMS] No. No. Here are some updated figures. IBM, down two points. AT&T, down three. And it looks like those rumors about Beige Computer are unfounded. The stock has rebounded smartly, and is now up twelve and a half points. All right. I like it. I like it. All right. I'm alive. [CHEERING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Digital switch. Hmm, what do you think? It's peaked out, Shaka brother. It's on a downward slide, man. MAN: I'm thinking soy beans. I'm thinking institutional, possibly IBM. I got it. Debbie Does Dallas. I'm gonna open a porno date club. I don't know. I'm kinda partial to beans. And I don't really give a shit what we invest in as long as I can get my old lady a 1976 Chevy Caprice classic so she can visit me in style. Just look at that. Since when did that little worm become top dog? This is the '80s, sir, and everybody respects big business. What are you trying to tell me? I suddenly became a warden of a prison with 200 yuppie inmates. I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Will you shut down? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] HERBIE: Hey, hold on. Hold on you guys. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Thank you, Shaka. All right, fellas, what if we are successful? I say we make a little money, and then... A little? Come on. With your expertise in our cash, we can make a fucking bundle. Yeah. But have you guys thought about what we're gonna do with the profits? I mean, has anybody even thought of that how we're living here? I mean, the cells are a disgrace. The plumbing doesn't work. The food is total shit. The warden thinks we're a bunch of animals. And, you know, he's on to something. I mean, we're living like animals. I could walk down a tier here and get knifed just like that. Anybody touches you, me and my brothers, we rip his goddamn intestines out. Raoul, listen, man. I don't want anybody ripping intestines out over me, okay? Okay. Okay, man. Well, what do you want, Herbie? I wanna invest in the prison. I just said the "I" word. -Yeah. -And I didn't sneeze. -SLY: Hey. -HERBIE: Yeah. So, look, that's what I've been trying to say. I would like to improve the prison and invest in us. Is that a great idea or what? That's bullshit. Bullshit, man. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] All right. All right. All right. Look, it's not a great idea. Suppose we go along with this idea, who decides how we spend the money? We do. -SHAKA: We do? -Yeah. It's a-- it's a board of directors, man. Just like US Steel. And the board decides how to spend the money? HERBIE: Yeah. -I like it. -HERBIE: [CHUCKLES] All right. I like it a lot. Yeah. Where are we going, Mr. Wolf? Just follow me, Ms. Scott. HERBIE: So we all agreed the profits from Con Inc. will be used to improve the prison and to help your families, including our dental and health insurance plan for your kids. Now, all in favor say aye. Aye. What? I got a question, damn it. How the hell are we--gee. Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. No disrespect. [CLEARS THROAT] How are we supposed to get these improvements past the warden? Well, that's up to our sergeant-at-arms, Mr. Wolf. Do you foresee any problems, sir? Only Muncy and the warden, and I can handle them. Only Muncy and the warden? I said I could fucking... [CLEARS THROAT] I don't foresee any difficulties that can't be circumvented. SLY: Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] That leaves one last item to be considered. What's that? Nomination for chairman of the board. And I nominate, Mr. Herbert Altman. I second the nomination. -Agree. -Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. [CLEARS THROAT] Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. The election is so recorded. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] All right, gentleman. Well, let's get to work. So what's the first order of business, Mr. Chairman? Well, we got to get our treasurer to concluded our very first stock transaction. When is the next time you're going to New York, Madam Treasurer? [CHUCKLES] Oh, no. Madam Treasurer? Me? That's right. We all voted for you. -It's unanimous. -I can't. I mean, I'm really flattered. I am. I--I'm just already too deeply involved. Listen, guys, I can't. I-I can't. I've--I mean, it's an absolute no. I just can't. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, Reggie. Let's go shopping. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] You actually got someone to donate these computers? Uh-hmm. It's a grant from a charitable organization. They're interested in prison reform. Must be a charity ran by idiots. What we'll cover today, gentlemen, is ebb and flow in the marketplace and its impact on risk arbitrage. Our first order of business is index futures... Scum like that will never learn how work computers. Gentleman, start your engines. Program booted, sir. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] And what did Conic do this morning. Three hundred thousand shares of Allied Rubber opening at nine and a half, already to twelve, sir. Double it. You want 600 to 12? In my personal account. -But, sir... -Have they ever been wrong? -No, sir. -Shh. Do you know what that sound is? What sound? That's the sound of happy feet. [LAUGHS] What exactly is wrong with you? Wrong? Nothing is wrong. Everything is wonderful. Ellen told me that Con Inc. is preparing to buy out Allied Rubber. In a few days, the stock will go through the roof. You idiot. Don't you realize you're trading on insider information? I know. And it's the third time this month. The guilt is causing me great duress, Arthur, but one thing does seem to help. Yeah? What's that? We're making a fucking fortune. I'll check the annual report on GTO Pharmaceuticals. I think they're prime for a leveraged buyout. Is that your recommendation? Sure. Well, Raoul, what's your recommendation? GTO Pharmaceuticals has no liquidity, a negative cash flow, and a high dead ratio, the bottom line, brothers, an unsound investment. Wait. Wait a second now. No. No. You wait a second, Sly man. Your last investment idea cost us $380,000. You know, I got to with Raoul on this one 'cause he's in charge of new acquisitions. Hey, don't get down, man. You guys are doing a great job. Speaking of which, let's get to work. Okay. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] SONIA: Wonderful. SLY: Excellent. SONIA: It's almost like the sun in Jamaica. SLY: Absolutely. SONIA: [SIGHS] I miss Jamaica. SLY: Such a wonderful sunrise, don't you know? -Will you take me there? -Sure. -Want some chicken? -Anytime, I thank you. Yo, Herbie, I'd like you to meet Sonia Ansell, manager of our car dealership in Montego Bay. -Hi, Sonia. -Hello, Mr. Altman. May I say what a great pleasure it is to finally meet the signature I've been getting on my check every week. Well, I think the pleasure's mine. Say hello to Jamaica when you get down there. -SONIA: It's a pleasure. -Sly. Hey, Cowboy. -Hey. -How you doing? Meet my little dogies, Linda and Carrie. Hi, girls. Why don't start eating your pies, huh? They're beautiful, man. Thanks. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Hey, Raoul. How you doing in there, man? -Hey, pretty good. -Isn't this excellent? Yeah. Beautiful. You remember my brother, Emilio? -Mr. Altman. -Oh, yeah. Hi, Emilio. -How are you? -You know, we're really, really proud of what you're doing in East LA. Great, great business you're doing. So am I, Mr. Altman. In fact, I'd like to speak to you about opening other retail outlet. All right. Why don't you drop a prospectus, okay, and give it to Raoul? He'll present it at our next board meeting. -Very good. -The next East LA Iacocca. All right, man. Good to see you. -Hey. -Yeah? I just wanted to tell you, man, outside before, I had no dream, but now I do, okay? -Okay. -All right. Thanks Raoul. Hey, how you doing you guys? I'd like you to meet my mother. Hi. She's beautiful, man. Enjoy your picnic. How are you doing? Hey, man. How you doing too? I never thought I'd ever say this, but I'm gonna really miss this place. Hey, man. You're getting out of here. You're not getting out of county. I mean, you know, you--you're gonna be our district manager for all our fast foods in Westchester. -You're covered, man. -We're behind you. -Thank you, man. -All right. You have a good one. Later, Shaka. Hey, come on, man. Go. [KEYBOARDS CLACKING] A surprise inspection. My God. -That keeps a man on-- -Yo, you know the drill. You, you, you, move. Chairs. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Have a seat. This place is looking like a pigsty. I haven't got all day, Mr. Wolf. Yes, sir. I'm gonna have your ass, Mr. Altman. It's just a question of time. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Brothers, hey, I know I let you all down lately but I have something that is very hot and with your consideration. It seems Eddie Tyler is our newest addition here -in the joint. -Eddie who? Eddie Tyler, our newest addition. He's doing the fire spot for B and E. His brother broke into DigiTech and he found this. It's a confidential memo from DigiTech. It seems there's going to be a, uh, friendly takeover of Keytronics Computer. That stock is gonna be airborne. We buy now, we make a killing which should even the books on my $380,000 loss. We can't use this. Why the hell not? Sir, couldn't that piece of paper, wouldn't it make us guilty of... -Insider trading. -Insider trading. Yeah. It would, it definitely would. We can't use that shit. You're crazy, man. Illegal? Count me out. Thank you, Sly, but I don't wanna do no fucking time, all right? Time? Look around you, brother, what do you think this is, Club Med? -Hey, that's cold, bro. -Cold? -Let it go, Sly. -What? Just let it go, man. Look, I know I've been screwing up lately, y'all, so I'm hoping this kind of settles our account, you dig. Come on, I got a little surprise for you. Check this out. Yeah. [ROBOT SOUND] All right, y'all. If you will accompany the Sly. What is this? This better be good. Whoa, what's this? -Check it out. -Check it out. Man. All right. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] That was just an appetizer, brothers. Now, for the main course. [DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] Comes complete with a warden-proof alarm system, you dig. Now let's party. [CHEERING] Hi. Aren't you gonna go to Sly's party? Yeah. I, uh, I am. I figured you'd be coming this way and that--well, maybe you'd like a glass of champagne with me. Yeah. [PARTY MUSIC PLAYING] I talked to the review board and I want to get your hopes up but it's very possible that they are gonna recommend the reopening of your case. So you live around here, I mean, because I live around here, you know what I'm saying? I mean, I really live-- I like you, you know what I'm saying? I like you a lot because I live around here, oh, you live around here, we can live together. It's nice, it's cheap. [CHEERING] Woo-hoo! Look at them tubes, yeah haha! You know, it's-- these parts are dangerous. You know, I think-- well, I really ought to walk you back because anything could happen, I mean, there's wolves out there. -Convicts. -Yeah. Okay. You know, I've been watching you... for a long time, baby, you know... I really need you, baby. [ALARM BLARING] Oh, jeez. Do me a favor. Hold that pose, write my parole board. See you. Damn. Damn! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I gotta get back to my cell. I'm singing-- Oh, time--timing. Timing. That's great timing. Great. The warden is coming. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Whoa. Hey. Out a little late tonight, aren't you, scum? Warden. I'm sorry, it's my fault. I-I-I called them here for an evening therapy. You're a liar Ms. Scott. Altman, 20 days in the box. Lock him up. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, come on. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Look, Herbie's been in the box 15 days and we have a cash flow problem. We gotta sell some assets to meet the margin call. We are in no position to sell any assets. Well, why do they want a margin call now? Because our speculative stock show increased negativity. It means we're going under. The house of Forsythe doesn't trust us anymore. Well, hey, in terms of solutions, the Sly will provide. Oh, yeah? Just how are you gonna do that? Hey, you are gonna love this. Herbie. Are you in there, man? I fucked up, Herbie. Just like I've been doing all my life. Fucked up. All that talk about me being a big man on the outside, not true. You know what I'm really in here for? Selling firecrackers. I drove a load 800 miles from Georgia, and who did I sell them to? The FBI. What happened, Sly? SLY: Herbie... I've been kicked off the board of Con Inc., for efforts injurious and detrimental to the company. And for suggesting we sell a few fraudulent bonds. Fraudulent bonds? Well, it was a great scam I couldn't have missed! HERBIE: God. I can't believe it. SLY: I don't, either. I'm into shock, Herbie. They kicked me off the board, me, for being a crook! Shit. And that's not the worst of it. What, there's more? Yeah. They kicked you off too. Me? For what? Advising me to be a crook. And I don't know where they got that idea, man. HERBIE: [LAUGHS] What's so--hey. An attitude like that is a very bad sign, Herbie. I'm talking some major psychological damage in there. I'mma have to speak to Dr. Scott about you, man. Hey, Sly. What happened to your face, man? Oh, this? Well, the Warden requested a private interview. He's closing in on Con Inc., man. But I'm afraid he's gonna fall apart before he finds it. What are we gonna do? You're gonna have to tell the Warden I need to see him. For what? Sly, just do it! Okay. All right. Did you hear that? -Yeah. -Let's go. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Altman. It's your show. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WARDEN: Very good, gentlemen. You did a very good job, I'm proud of you. Herbie, sign it. We're supposed to do that in private. You gave me your word. I changed my mind. Sign it. -MAN: Don't do it. -MAN: Don't do it, Herbie. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I did it. Mr. Wolf? Now I own 51% of Con Inc. So you're all working for me. I don't remember telling anyone to stop working. Back to work, partners. You're a two-faced son a bitch, Warden. You're worse than anybody in this prison. You're the--you're the ultimate small-timer. Confined 15 days in the box seems to have unbalanced your mind. Not really. I can get you another 12 million. In cash. Talk to me. Sell the company. I got just the buyer. Look, you sell Con Inc. on paper, you got the only asset that matters: me. I buy all the stocks, I make the investments. Herbie, why would you wanna put $12 million in my pocket? So I can take it from Reggie Forsythe. The motherfucker who framed me. A small chance of revenge, Warden. What the hell? Every man's entitled to a little revenge. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Uh, I think you all know who I am. I'm Herbie Altman. Prisoner 2778310, and Chairman of the Board of Con Inc. Ex-chairman! You-you sold us out! Mr. Ex-chairman! All right. That may be true. There may be no more Con Inc., at least the way we know it. That's bullshit! And you got the right to be angry. We're just experiencing slight business turndown. Yeah. You're about to experience a slight case of my knife. You lied to us, cabron. All right. The hell with that? I just want you guys to know something. Yeah, and what the hell is that? I want you to know that I'm proud of you. -All of you. -MAN: Oh, really? Yeah. You guys threw me off of the board over an issue involving ethics, and I wanna tell you something, it doesn't happen in business. Well, why the fuck did you sell us all out there? I didn't sell you out. It was time for Con Inc. to evolve -into something else? -And what's that? The Warden was on our ass. -MAN: Bullshit. -Everything was on our ass. More bullshit! Look, when a company's facing a hostile takeover, you gotta fight. And that's what I'm doing. Now, we can have the PAC-MAN defense, we have the white knight defense, poised and peeled defense, it doesn't matter if you don't fight. That's what I'm doing. I'm fighting! [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Open the gate. -Open the door, Wolf. -Open the gate! What are you doing? MAN: No. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Let him--let him--let him up! Let him up! Now! Get up, Herbie. Get him up! Now what you got to say, Herbie? Say it. I need your trust for the next few days. Unlimited trust. It's gonna look strange what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing. I'm doing it for us. MAN: Kill him! Kill him! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Shut up! Shut up! You're acting like animals. At least this man taught you a little self-respect. So give him a chance! -MAN: Kill him! -I'm not gonna tell your ass again! We're gonna give you a chance, Herbie. Because you helped us, we're gonna help you. You got our trust. Just one more time. Twelve million dollars? In cash. ELLEN: I told him that was the purchase price. HERBIE: He wanna come here and look the place over, Warden. What do you mean? He's coming here? Well, he's not gonna buy Con Inc. sight unseen. We got a lot of cosmetic surgery to do if we're gonna transform this place into a business with growth potential. Hmm. When's he coming? Tomorrow. I must admit, the irony, it does appeal to me. Selling the company while I still own the key piece of manpower and doing it on federal property. [LAUGHING] Hey is America a great place or what, man? Yo. All right. I'll do it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Tell me I'm not crazy but, isn't this a prison? It was. -Once. -WARDEN: Not anymore. Of course not. We haven't heard of a prison with one guard and open-door policy. -Welcome to Con Inc. -Oh. I'm Mr. Swan. Oh, Ms. Scott. Mr. Tennant is expecting you. This way. What's happening, brother? -Mr. Forsythe? -REGGIE: Yes. John C. Tennant. REGGIE: Oh. How do you do? How do you do? I've heard so much about you. It is indeed an honor to meet a man of your dynamic reputation. Well, I've certainly heard enough about Con Inc. through its own dynamic reputation. Wonderful. Well, let's cut the bullshit. I'll show you around. My thoughts exactly. -Oh. -Well, Mr. Forsythe, I bought this old prison for a song. Oh. [KEYBOARDS CLACKING] Absolutely perfect for our diversified interest. We have power plants, printing presses, machine shops, tool and die works. even a license plate factory. Just kidding. See, there are various ways to hide cash flow when you have several operations under the same roof, if you get my meaning. Oh, I certainly do. And this is Mr. Kay Monroe, our chief stock analyst. He'll be staying with the company. Really? Uh, how long? Three years with good behavior. Thanks, Mr. Monroe. -Um, Mr. Forsythe. -Hmm. WARDEN: We have hot and running cold water over here. -Down there. -REGGIE: Okay. [MUSIC PLAYING] DR. SCOTT: Mrs. Wilson. Good to see you again. It is good to see you, Dr. Scott. Mr. Thomas, welcome. Where is Warden Tennant? Uh, well, to be perfectly honest, he's very busy. But he asked me to show you around and point out some of our new reforms. -Reforms? -Yes. And I know and you and the board are going to approve. Reggie, I'm worried. -Don't be. -I'm not so sure about this. I am. And I want it. Eighty million in assets for twelve million in cash? -Uh-hmm. -How can we go wrong? Gentlemen, I am extremely impressed with your operation and I think, uh, we can do business. Good. Very good. -Thank you, Mr. Swan. -Thank you. Oh. Ah. Well, here's to what we all deserve. Cheers. -Cheers. -Hmm. Mr. Muncy, may I have a word with you, please? Now, let's sign some paper, shall we? What a good idea. [LAUGHTER] What do you want? Just this. [MAKES NOISE] That's cute, Sylvester. Is show time over? Yeah, it's over, man. Man-handler. What's the latest, cowboy? Oh, I'm working on Perry Semiconductors. It has a basic profit ratio of 7.2 per annum. Stockbroker's training course for convicts. Suits and ties for inmates. A very progressive approach, Dr. Scott and very unlike Warden Tennant. Very. Well, Reggie. I think that does it. That's it. Uh, it's all in order. Now against my better judgment, you are the proud owner of Con. Inc. Everybody, freeze. What the hell are you doing, Herbie? Sit down, scum! Hello, Reggie. -Hello, Herbie. -Hi. What are you doing here? Thirteen years. This is the federal prison! Do you mean this is an actual -functioning penitentiary? -You just paid -$12 million dollars-- -Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! WARDEN: What do you want, Altman? HERBIE: I would like a signed confession. -TENNANT: About what? -HERBIE: How about abuse of power, stealing from state penitentiary, corruption, fraud? -That? -Yeah. Well, you're not gonna get it. What do you want from me, Herbie? I want a confession, you ass, that you're an embezzler, an inside traitor, and that you committed perjury during my trial. Oh, Herbie. You're such a bore. That was an impeccable frame-up. You were the perfect sap then, you are the perfect sap now. He's bluffing. Herbie, what's come over you? You used to be such a decent young man. I'm a convict, asshole. Hey, Herbie. You ain't planning on shooting nobody for real, are you? Oh, I couldn't kill before, but now I can. I like the feeling. SLY: Uh-uh. Hey, man. I ain't gonna let you do that, man. I am not in murder. -You are not in murder. -HERBIE: I can kill now. -What are you talking about? -SLY: It's bullshit, man. -HERBIE: We gotta get out-- -Altman. It's good. SLY: Hey, hey. It's not loaded. Not loaded. Not loaded. Hey, man. I'm into firecrackers. I ain't no bullet, man. Nobody is gonna stop me, Herbie. Not the cons, the state, and certainly not you. Nobody cares. You see, Altman, the cons were never strong enough to stop me. They're all scumbags. Scum. The state never cared to know what I was doing so I might as well keep on doing it. Muncy, get your ass in here now. Muncy's not coming in. WARDEN: Oh, why not? SLY: It's called a prison break. Everybody's escaped. Congratulations, Warden. You're the first cat in history to have an entire prison population escape. Guards, report in now. All guards report to me now. Guards in D block, report in. D block, report in. What are you gonna do now, Warden? I'm gonna say goodbye. What about us? Gentlemen, you're on your own. I think we just made a bad deal, Arthur. We're screwed. Let's get out of here. Right. Bye-bye, Herbie. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] I don't know about you, boys. But I'm getting out of town. Well, Reggie, I think we ought to grab some of that sun, sand, and surf we talked about. Arthur, will you relax? How many times do I have to tell you? Herbie hasn't got a thing against us. There are no witness. [LAUGHTER] WARDEN: Stand back. [GUN COCKS] Come on. Come on. Come on. Easy. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Tough luck, scum. [HANDCUFF CLINKING] -Oh, shit. -Oh, shit. Tough luck, scum. [GUNS COCKING] Oh, shit. [ELEVATOR DINGS] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Jones, I need your signature. Mr. Altman, today's report. -Okay. -Thank you, sir. -Sir, these [INDISTINCT] -Sell them. Let's go on [INDISTINCT] Things are looking excellent right now. Couldn't be better, Herb. I'm having a little trouble with the ad campaign, but fear not, the Sly will provide. Well, everything is great in my department, Mr. Jim. How's the rally doing? Whee doggies, running wild. Threw the index off the charts. I have to fix the freaking computer. Fix the computer? Mr. Altman, there's a telephone call for you. Oh, I'll take it over this one. COWBOY: Hey, I got a tip on pork bellies. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] H.R. Altman. Hi. I'll be home Saturday. All right. Look, I'll be home Friday. I love you too. Ready, Mr. Wolf? Yes, Warden. Morning. Morning, Mr. Muncy. How are you today, gentlemen? How about a little room service? After all, I own this prison. Reggie, you're an asshole. How are you today? Any news from the parole board, Dr. Scott? Hi. Bye. Uh-hmm. This place is filthy. Filthy dirty. Filthy dirty. Ten days in a box, ten days in a box. You know why 10 days in a box? Because I want a pristine, pristine clean cell and this place is filthy. Look at your hair. Look at your suit. What is the matter with you? Dust, dirt, scums. Scum, you heard that before? Filthy, dirty scum. That's it. This whole place is filthy dirty. I know is Marco was-- you know, Marco, what's the matter with you? What's the matter with you, huh? What's the matter with you? Look at this place. It's dirty. Filthy dirty. I want a new suit. I want new clothes. Not you, because you don't care. You know why? Hmm. All right. Top of the world, Ma. Nobody messes with Johnny Rico. Nobody, see? I am Lawrence of Arabia. La-la-la-la-la. Oh, yeah. That's it. Come on. That's it. Come on. Let's go. Let's work out. That's why it's prison aerobic. That's what we need. You got to lose weight there. Lose weight here. Let's go. Up, down, up, down. Come on. Get it right off here because you know what [INDISTINCT] all night long [INDISTINCT] it's my nose, it's my ears-- I don't care if you care. I don't care [INDISTINCT] want something to eat? Want something to eat? Take two loads, please. Not me. I'll tell you why. You know why? Because no one is [INDISTINCT] no good. No, you're [INDISTINCT] good, see? I'm not gonna share. So what are you, mister? Hmm, hmm. Well, how's everything going? Everything okay? Not for me. It ain't okay because you know why? Because... you and I are gonna be great friends. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
