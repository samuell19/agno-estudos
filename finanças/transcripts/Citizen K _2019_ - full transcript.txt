The richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky seized at gunpoint by Russian Special Forces... Khodorkovsky is locked up in an overcrowded Russian prison. So, to stay at a prison, why didn't you leave the country? Out! To hear Vladimir Putin tell it, Mikhail Khodorkovsky is a villain in a real-life gangster movie. But to Putin's opponent's, Khodorkovsky's ten years in a Siberian prison made him a hero for the cause of human rights and democracy. Now out of prison, Khodorkovsky is looking for a third act. That drew my interest at a time when we all seem haunted by Russia's role in the world, so I started a film about it. While I can go to Russia, he could not. He's wanted there for murder. So like many stories about Russia these days, this one started in London. Putin and Khodorkovsky they are both very strong guy. - Everyone else, weaker. - Yes. But Putin... respects Khodorkovsky as a rival. He really respects him, because he is strong. Just behind Red Square, there's a shopping mall where actors get paid for posing in tourist photos, playing Russia's past leaders. In the winter of 2018, I was told that the number of Stalin's was multiplying. A local joked was that this was a sign. Russia was nearing a pageantry of election season. Well, there is no election season. There's election theater. The Kremlin has to create their own counter candidates. Because no one wants to be a candidate against Putin because you will lose anyway. Today's election theatre is what has become of Russia's experiment in democracy. A bold attempt to shift from years of Communist rule to free market capitalism. In 1991, the Soviet Union has convulsed in a struggle of its future. But oligarch Communists come to an empire in a system that centralized government control. A new generation demanded economic and political freedoms. Their charismatic leader, who was Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin! Yeltsin! Yeltsin! Boris Yeltsin has become the one rallying point for oppositions and the hardliners. I was there as the BBC Moscow correspondent from '88 to the end of '91. This is Martin Sixsmith. Martin Sixsmith. Martin Sixsmith. BBC News Moscow. Yeltsin was a very, very inspirational figure. Back in 1991, he was the man for the moment. Yeltsin! Yeltsin! It just felt like, you know, a sort of, see change in the fortunes of a country. I remember writing all these sort of, great optimistic articles about how decades of communism have come to an end and now we were going to have a new Russia, a new Russia with democracy and freedom, and openness. And looking back, I'm... a little ashamed that I wrote all that, because the signs were there, even then, I think, that, um, it wasn't going to work out. He was a man of great intelligence, and great vision. He was also a very decisive man. As soon as a door opened, he was straight through it. He'd been a member of the young communist organization, Komsomol. Not because he believed in communism but because Gorbachev and the Perestroika era started to relax the ban on private enterprise starting with the Komsomol. By the time the collapse of the Soviet Union happened at 1991, he had some cash in his pocket. He created the first commercial bank in Russia. "The Holocaust", he said, "I thought of this all as a game, and I was good at playing the game." Exactly. He was good at playing the game, but most people were very bad at playing the game. Moving from the Soviet Union into capitalist Russia, most Russians were completely naive. Because they had read all these propaganda for all these years. With capitalists, where people was, you know... big cigars, and money coming out of their pockets. And they imagined that you would get rich automatically. Where they grew up, everything was taken care of by the state. You know, free economy sounds nice. But you have to make choices every five minutes. In the early '90s, Russians face lots of choices they didn't really understand. Egged on by American free market boosters, the Russian government announced a program to hand out a chip worth around 40 dollars to every citizen. The chips were called "vouchers." And could be traded sole for cash, or exchanged for shares in small or state-owned enterprises. They were sold as golden tickets to escape the dead end of communism. It was a time of great economic hardship, and the ordinary people didn't realize what this piece of paper was worth. But the people who did, some type of people with suitcases full of cash, and they said, "Look, you don't need that piece of paper. Here, we'll give you ten dollars. And you can go and buy some bread." The more Khodorkovsky made, the more vouchers and companies he could buy. Either on the open market or in backroom deals. It was gangster capitalism, with the rule of laws weak and bendy as a rubber band. Under communism, the absence of personal wealth meant there were few targets for violent criminals. Now, organized crime groups prey on the new rich of the capitalist era. Moscow's become the murder capital of Europe. If you were rich, and people knew you were rich, you were a target. It's Wild West capitalism. In '92, we launched The Moscow Times. And we had a lot of news. A lot of people got killed, and many, many companies were looking for protection. The Moscow Times developed pretty well. And then, two years later, I launched Cosmopolitan. Which, from day one, was an enormous commercial success. And it attracted a lot of shady people. I thought, you know, maybe it's better to get one of these rising oligarchs as a shareholder. There was one guy in particular that I got interested in. And it was Mikhail Khodorkovsky. They moved to a very fancy castle in Moscow. Machine guns all over the place, he had former KGB colonels running his security. This was not Russia, this was... Khodorkovsky land, you know, Medvedev has a nice house, Nevzlin was next door, and then, there was Khodorkovsky. I said that, "Most of the times, it's a fiercely independent newspaper. And if we sell ten percent of our sales... we want to remain a fiercely independent newspaper." And he thought about it, and he said yes. He was an extremely... intelligent person. But of course, using every trick in the book available to him. And at that time, this transition from communism to capitalism... uh, was so fast, that it was impossible for the legal structure to keep up. But it's Berezovsky, who was one of the big seven oligarchs very famously said... "The seven of us controlled 50 percent... of the whole Russian economy." Two of the oligarchs placed big bets on the future of television. Boris Berezovsky bought a national network called Channel 1. He thought he'd cash in by turning a Soviet propaganda vehicle into a selling machine. Vladimir Gusinsky set his sights on starting a new network called NTV. The original concept of NTV was a TV channel, which is not controlled by the government. An investor who was... Vladimir Gusinsky. He didn't know anything about TV at all, but... there was a benefit. He badly underestimated how much it would cost. Bravo. Gusinsky spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying movies, launching game shows and building an independent news division from scratch. Thanks to the Soviets, most everyone in Russia had TV sets. So the money started rolling in. The oligarchs organized between themselves. "I do the oil, you do the cable communications, you do the real estate." So, it was one big, uh, scam. For the oligarchs, the scam of Russian capitalism was only possible as long as there was a political system that protected private property and individual rights. Call it "democracy." But if the communists returned to power, well... that would have been bad for business. Yeltsin was up for re-election. But the country was in a really, really bad state. People looked around, if this is... you know, capitalism that they promised, we don't want anything to do with it. The government coffers were empty, so people's salaries weren't being paid, pensions weren't being paid. And if you imagine, as a president who's not paying people's pensions and people's salaries, you're not gonna be very popular. It really did look as if Gennady Zyuganov, the communist leader, who's going to beat Yeltsin hands down at the election. Spasiba! The problem was that, Yeltsin, at that point, was so weak. He was at the three percent approval rate. He was sick, he had all these heart attacks, he was down and out. One of the very new things which NTV started doing, was a puppet show calledKukly. It was a really... a satirical, satirical show. ♪ Besame ♪ Besame mucho In one of the show, Mr. Yeltsin was portrayed as Don Quijote. And the head of his security was portrayed as his, uh, Sancho Panza. It's not Russian tradition to laugh at the president, so laughing at... at a czar, so to say, at an emperor... was something unheard... unheard of. Yeltsin was in a very difficult situation. We'd film him, and he'd be... staggering across the room, barely able to stand upright. It was clear that he was quite ill. But of course, there was a natural... sympathy and support for Yeltsin from a Russian TV. Yes, probably, it was not very fair but his opponent was a communist. Who, openly, was saying that, "No such thing as freedom of... of the press, or of this... under his rule. Openly supporting Yeltsin, NTV hatched an elaborate plan to hide the president's ill health. Malashenko sent a crew to Yeltsin's country home where he was secretly confined to bedrest, after a major heart attack. We had to demonstrate that Yeltsin is still alive, at least. He was too seriously ill to travel to Moscow. So we took some furniture from his Kremlin office and we reproduced it at his country house. So at this set, he was visited by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin And Yeltsin spoke with him for 30 seconds, signed some paper, and it was shown on TV. Many times I was told that it's a thing I shouldn't do. My response is very simple. It was and it is that I would rather elect the corpse of Yeltsin than elect Zyuganov. We had suddenly, this amazing, new Yeltsin. And, you know, maybe the doctors have given him a shot of adrenaline or something. But I think what had really re-invigorated him was the deal he'd cut with the oligarchs. They struck a Faustian bargain. Which has become known as loans for shares. In every Faustian bargain, the devil is in the details. On the verge of collapse, Yeltsin's government desperately needed cash to pay salaries and pensions. The oligarchs agreed to funnel money to the state by making a series of loans the government couldn't afford to pay. When the loans did default, the oligarchs got the right to buy Russia's biggest state enterprises. And sham auctions run by the oligarchs themselves. On TV, the deals played like arms-length banking transactions. In reality, the oligarchs have cut inside deals to pay bargain basement prices for Russia's most valuable assets. Khodorkovsky was interested in a massive state oil company called Yukos. His bank Menatep, was the only bettor at the auction, which was run by... Menatep. At the time, Yukos was valued at five billion dollars. Menatep offered and paid what it had on-hand, three hundred and ten million. A steal. It was all conflict of interest. There was no transparency, it was just one big mess. You know, we wrote about this stuff. And Menatep was a shareholder of The Moscow Times. Khodorkovsky himself was not sitting on our board, but Leonid Nevzlin, his right hand man. So this Nevzlin, was, you know, fuming. Was there ever any pressure on you to write something that was kind of, pro-Yukos? This was the biggest mistake of the oligarchs and the journalists, and the liberals. I blame them as much as the communists and the other forces, even more. Because they were the people who has the vision and, and the will to change, and... and they were going to create a new Russia. And what do they do the first time they get into trouble in, you know, in '96... their candidate may lose. They just throw out the whole idea of a normal democratic process. Putin is also a product of the '90s. Vladimir Putin came from nowhere. He's been a minor official in the KGB in East Germany when the war collapsed. And found himself out of a job. He found a post up in Leningrad with... a man called Anatoly Sobchak. If you worked your whole life with Sobchak, the most liberal man in Russia, you must be an okay guy. That's what I thought. In fact, Putin was accused of launching a kickback scheme to embezzle money meant for food for St. Petersburg, which was facing a famine. When members of the city council raised the issue, Sobchak did not fire Putin. He promoted him to deputy mayor. As if to commemorate the moment, Putin commissioned this documentary about himself. He kept the title simple. When Putin's boss failed to win re-election in 1996, Putin and some friends flew to Moscow where they landed low-level jobs for the Kremlin. Putin held six jobs in three years. By 1999, he was Prime minister, and Yeltsin's likely successor. But Putin didn't get to the top all by himself. The oligarchs, were in fact, the force, that in many ways, brought Vladimir Putin to power. Putin was put there, very much, to carry on Yeltsin's rule. With the help of ultimately, four people. Yeltsin's daughter and her husband, and two of the oligarchs who were close to Yeltsin, Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich. They were looking for a successor who would, basically guarantee their safety and guarantee their wealth. One of the so-called oligarchs set about selling Putin to the public. Boris Berezovsky used his TV channel to mock Putin's political rivals, and promote his image as a tough leader. When a series of explosions killed hundreds in Moscow, some suspect that Putin himself might have been involved. But at the time, TV news footage highlighted Putin's tough response to the bombings, which he blamed on Chechen terrorists. He's tough. And I think this is the thing that we need in this country at the moment. Some toughness. Yeltsin left office on December 31st, 1999. And appointed Putin acting president. Putin, in turn, promised to forgive Yeltsin for any sins or crimes he may have committed. It was another inside deal, sealed by a new election a few months later. Putin running as an incumbent, won easily. Eighteen years later, he's still in the same office. Putinism is a way to restore... pride in your country. Putinism in itself... there's nothing wrong with it. Uh, when Putin started... he did a lot of good things for the country. Because it was a mess. People were completely dispirited. Um, people longed... to, to be part of something. You know, if you grew up in a world power, and then the rest of the world faced you as a joke, as a Banana Republic, it's very humiliating. So people really needed such a fable. Putin has declared that he supported the liberal views of Yeltsin, and that he was going to keep Russia on the course of liberty and openness. But even then, you could see that Putin was looking for a way to recalibrate this relationship between political barrier and the oligarchs. At first he said, "Look, we'll do a deal, uh, I'm not gonna question the results of the privatization process, which meant I'm not gonna try and take back your business empires that you've... got through the, uh, loans for shares auctions. As long as you keep out of politics." For the moment, that separation of business and politics served Khodorkovsky's interests. For Khodorkovsky, business had been hard enough. He left banking to focus on Yukos. He travelled to remote regions of Siberia to learn how to pool oil out of the ground, move it and sell it. And he had to motivate workers and managers. He never needed to care for efficiency or competition. All these shady global oil companies that, you know, just lost money, and were totally inefficient. He turned it around, he started streamlining these companies. Khodorkovsky, from a business perspective, did an amazing job. But you know, small towns in Siberia, a lot of the people who worked there, they lost their job. Many local mayors were very unhappy. And some mayors... died. One of those mayors was Vladimir Petukhov, of Nefteyugansk, a major Yukos hub. Petukhov was furious with Khodorkovsky for laying off nearly 15,000 workers. Delays in payroll, and battles over paying local taxers. Khodorkovsky claimed that Petukhov was in the grip of Chechen gangsters. And using taxes to pay for bribes. So Khodorkovsky flew to Nefteyugansk with bags of cash to make direct payments to teachers, nurses and city workers. In protest, the mayor embarked on a hunger strike. Until finally, a deal was cut. Four days later, the mayor was shot. At first, we went to Nefteyugansk to look at the oil industry weeks after the murder of the mayor. And Khodorkovsky was hated there, because Khodorkovsky at that time was already a billionaire, and these were the people who were, basically, unable to get food. I got angry as a young journalist and I wrote what I saw. I don't know whether... Khodorkovsky's man, or himself was involved in the death of the mayor. I wouldn't put it past them. Petukhov, the mayor, was murdered on Khodorkovsky's birthday. Birthdays have been interesting. The other famous case is Ana Politkovskaya. The crusading journalist who was investigating lots of Kremlin corruptions. And she was murdered on Putin's birthday. Some observers called it a meltdown. Russian stocks are at their lowest levels since President Boris Yeltsin had heart surgery in 1996. The biggest concern now is that the Russian government will be forced to devalue the ruble. He was opening schools, you know, his foundation was doing the work. He was the entrepreneur with the vision. The type of entrepreneur that Russia needed, to create this new economy. And he immediately brought in Western know-how, new technology, And in a few years built, you know, one of the best oil companies in the world. Khodorkovsky's work at Yukos paid off. When the ruble rose along with the oil prices, Just after the turn of the century, the Russian economy was booming. Powered in large part by oil. That was a business victory... but it was also a moment of political opportunity. Who would take credit for the turnaround? Former KGB agent turned politician? Or the ruthless oligarch whose attention was quickly turning to politics? Khodorkovsky's an interesting man. Because, now, he has all these money. He started thinking about, you know, "What's next? What is my role in society?" And this is why he clashes with Putin. There are rumors that Putin in particular, didn't like one program... where he was portrayed as a... midget man, who became a ruler of the country. Due to his power of magic. At some point, magic disappeared, and people see this midget man for what he is. Yeltsin could be angry at some program, but, uh, were no reprises. Putin and his people had an entirely different attitude towards TV. Putin was the product of television. They made him. He was absolutely nobody. I mean, nobody ever heard of Vladimir Putin. The fact that television could actually help make him into president, within six months. I think was enough for him to understand the real power. If TV could make his reputation... it could also break him. Seven months after Putin became president, a terrible underwater explosion ripped apart the Kursk, a Russian nuclear submarine. As the nation anxiously watched the efforts to rescue a few survivors... Putin was photographed hosting a barbecue at the seaside resort. For ten days, relentless TV news reports shredded Putin's reputation, by chronicling the incompetence and dishonesty of the government. To recover, Putin rushed to talk to the widows of the sailors. But rather than take responsibility, he looked to administer blame on television. Putin, as somebody who was both born and bred in the Soviet Union but more importantly, bred by the KGB, has this very conspiratorial view of the world. And that view of the world suggests that people don't have any free will, um, and history, therefore, doesn't have any free will. That everything is pre-planned, plotted by somebody else. So he immediately assumed that this was a plot... uh, to subvert him. There was a very emotional, I think, genuine outburst. Vladimir Putin, president of Russia. What happened with the submarine? - Thank you, Mr. President. - Thank you. Putin's command of the media was quickly evident. Even in the TV images of one of the grieving relatives, whose voice was silenced, with eerie efficiency. Putin and his people have KGB background. I'm talking about control. What you don't control, is a potential threat. What you control is safe. Everything should be controlled. So those things they did was to establish control, over TV, because uncontrolled TV was a threat. After the Kursk episode, Putin's government took over the two major TV networks controlled by oligarchs. Facing the prospect of prison, Gusinsky and his chief executive Malashenko, fled the country. Berezovsky soon followed. When Boris Berezovsky fell out with Putin in such a spectacular and public way, uh, he fled to London, and I had quite lots to do with him. He asked me if I could write his... biography for him. So I spoke to him over the years, and you know, socially, and, uh, at times, I recorded the conversations as well. ...has led Putin after the tragedy of Kursk submarine, and the most... During our meeting, he told me that... uh, I tried to destroy him. After that... he's really not good well. At this time, I need to see my friend... - Yes. - As a wronged man. You know, he kicked Berezovsky out to control of the first channel. He kicked Gusinsky out of the country, and... to control of NTV. He had the airwaves. Once he controlled the narrative and the image, which is everything in Russia, uh, he could take then control of the commanded hearts of the economy, the oil, uh, and take on the biggest tycoon. Putin had a very valid point. Half of the parliament is on the payroll of Khodorkovsky, many of the top people in the oil ministry are people appointed by the oligarchs. And you think, you know, "What is this?" If I want to be a real president I need to have my own people and I need to get these people out of politics. It was said at the time that you were busy courting or even buying influence in the Duma. ♪ Exxon Khodorkovsky invited the head of Exxon mobile, and said, "Look, my company is open, transparent, why don't we have a partnership? We can be a massive player on the world market." If you are Vladimir Putin sitting in the Kremlin, at a time when... the world is going to war over oil, and you have your least favorite oligarch... saying to the Americans, "I've got lots of oil. Do you want to come and share it?" You know, it's like a slap in the face. The struggle for power surfaced with an oil deal. Small company Northern Oil, paid seven million dollars for the rights to an oil field. Which had sold soon after, for 600 million dollars. to a government company, Rosneft. The man at the center of the deal was Igor Sechin, a close friend of Vladimir Putin. Were kickbacks involved? Khodorkovsky wanted to make an issue of the deal at an upcoming nationally televised forum on corruption. Putin had asked Russia's biggest businessmen to a round table discussion on television on the theme on the theme of corruption. Most of the guys who took part had the wisdom to figure out that it was a little bit of a fig leaf. But Khodorkovsky, he came under the whole pile of slides which reported that Russians felt that corruption existed at the highest levels of government. And they then got into the discussion what Khodorkovsky thought was a dodgy deal. This Northern oil deal, was Putin happy that you mentioned it? You saw it from the facial expression of Putin, he was really, really angry. Especially coming from Khodorkovsky. There were all these warning signs. Many of his people were arrested. It was hard for me to understand why Khodorkovsky was smiling or how he could say that what was happening is standard practice. Just four months after the TV battle with Putin, the top security official of Yukos, Alexey Pichugin, was arrested and tried in secret in connection with the series of contract killings. Which would include the murder of Mayor Petukhov That was strange, because five years earlier, the case have been dropped when the likely killers, two Chechen gangsters, have been murdered. Now the Kremlin was pushing a fresh story. The Chechens were replaced with new killers who suddenly confessed and testified that Pichugin ordered the hit. When Pichugin refused to implicate Khodorkovsky, Pechugan claimed he was dosed psychotropic drugs. When that didn't work, the new triggerman claimed that the order to kill the mayor come from Pichugin's boss, Leonid Nevzlin. The richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky seized at gunpoint by Russian Special Forces. Khodorkovsky is locked up in an overcrowded Russian prison. Did your hunger strike succeed? Was Lebedev let out of the dungeon? I remember calling my editor. I said, "They just arrested Khodorkovsky." And the response from London was, "Well, it couldn't have happened to a better man." I don't want to paint Khodorkovsky as an angel if he wasn't. But I was rather horrified when I saw Vladimir Putin holding a copy of my stories, saying, "Look, even the Western press outside, he was a terrible man." It was very clear that this is not about finding the truth, or finding what happened. It was about putting papers together, so that it looks like it's a real case. But, in fact, it's not a real case. As someone with a legal background in Russia, I had to try to interpret and explain this to American lawyers. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were put in a cage to show everyone who is the boss here. Khodorkovsky was accused of tax evasion, embezzlement. All these things. But it's this particularly hard to say whether or not he's guilty. Because the law was in such a fluid state in those years. All the other oligarchs did exactly the same things. And they were free to keep doing it. During the first trial, the Russian attorneys were trying to pretend like they're defending an ordinary case. The Russian prosecutors think the more papers they put together, the more it looks legitimate. They wrote like hundreds of volume of material of basically nothing. For example, the used company telephone directory. As an evidence of the criminal enterprise. Yukos as a company was accused of not paying taxes for six years. Khodorkovsky was discussing payment of back taxes that would settle Yukos's debts to the State. And when Yukos agreed to that, then another demand would come in. A new demand will be higher this time. So it wasn't a case of wanting to recoup the taxes that haven't been paid. It was a case of wanting to destroy Yukos. There was a bankruptcy auction. And I was denied access to it with no basic or any legitimate reason. A mysterious, newly-created company Baikal Finance Group suddenly emerged to bid for Yukos. But Baikal had no assets. And its headquarters turned out to be a vodka bar. Two hours outside of Moscow. When Baikal won the auction, it sold Yukos to the government-controlled Rosneft. Rosneft is the state oil company, and it is run by one of Putin's closest friends, Igor Sechin. Sechin was Putin's man. And when Putin renationalized a lot of companies, he created a new clause. Oligarch 2.0. In most countries in the world, oil companies are owned by the state. Nothing wrong with that. Good news for the Russians. You know? That's how 99 percent of the people saw it. The fact that the oligarchs were so reviled and resented by the Russian people was a fantastically useful tool for Putin. Putin very famously and publicly declared "I'm going to destroy the oligarchs as a class." And every Russian would know where the quotation came from. Because Stalin said very famously, "I'm going to destroy the rich, peasants as a class." And when he did bring the oligarchs to heel, it was incredibly popular. What he says to Khodorkovsky and to the country is that nothing belongs you. That you have no legitimate rights to it. We control everything and we can take away everything from you if you cross us. Do you think that being in prison gave you special insight to Putin and the people around him? Former oil tycoon, Mikhail Khodorkovsky who was jailed for embezzlement and tax evasion in 2003 is back in court. New charges brought against him, could see his term extended until 2017. The second trial was announced when Khodorkovsky was coming up to the point that he might get through. It seems very clear, Putin did not want him to get through. The second trial was a sequel in black comedy. In the first trial, the government convicted Khodorkovsky for not paying taxes on the oil HE sold. In the second, the government claimed he had never sold the oil. He'd stolen it. But if he had stolen it, where did he put it? And if he never sold it, why did he owe the taxes? Is it not clear? It's very important for me how this trial will finish because according to that, I'll know which country in the end my children will live in. Putin is very afraid of Khodorkovsky. And he wants him to be in the prison forever. This is against Russia. This is against Russia's future. And it means that this is not a country of law. This is a country of dictatorship. When he was in jail, he suddenly gained through his stamina, through his calm, through his resolution that moral authority and respect of people. I wouldn't say he has legitimacy as a political figure. But I think the perception of him has... made sort of a 180 degree turn. ♪ I found my thrill ♪ On blueberry hill There was a period when Putin because of the constitution had to step down as president and become prime minister. And his colleague, Dmitry Medvedev became president. There was a lot of talk at that time that perhaps Medvedev might be a rival power base to Putin's. Turned out to be completely incorrect. Because at the end of Medvedev's term as president, he simply stepped down and Putin came back into power. ♪ My dream came true ♪ The wind In the willow played ♪ ♪ Love's sweet melody Till 2008, I think Russia was on the right track. And Putin was okay. Then Putin decided to become more authoritarian. He also decided that the country could not live without him. That's what power does to you. You think you are the country, and the country thinks without Putin, there is no Russia. More than a 100 thousand protesters flooded Moscow's Bolotnaya Square to protest Putin's return to the presidency. The protesters at least could imagine Russia without Putin. The only way we could potentially get him out of jail is not through judicial system in Russia. But through some sort of negotiations involving Western leaders putting pressure on Putin. The host nation of Russia is continuing a well-timed release of high profile prisoners. We see a riot band member, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova has been freed as part of president Putin's amnesty. Putin really wanted to see Western leadership coming to Sochi and the pardon was his gesture in anticipation of gesture back from the Western leaders. How did you find out that you were going to be released? I haven't met him until he was released from prison. We had some vodka. Um, it was really unreal. He was really thinking what his next public step in that fight should be. And then he said that "I'm ready to make the public move." And he wanted to go to Kyiv. In Kyiv, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators demanded the government resign for rejecting closer ties with the EU in favor of better relations with Russia. Demonstrators pulled back under a hail of bullets fired by government forces. In 2014, Khodorkovsky moved to London and founded Open Russia. An umbrella group that funds anti-Putin efforts and invests in long-range visions for democracy in Russia. The money for Open Russia comes from Khodorkovsky. Somehow, even while serving hard time in Siberia, he or his friends managed to protect some of his fortune. While in Moscow, I spent a bit of time with Open Russia. On the ground, their efforts were less than effective. Volunteers didn't have strong enough glue to paste up their posters. And open Russia teleconferences in which Khodorkovsky beamed himself into Moscow only attracted the interest of a few dozen supporters. Khodorkovsky is not a forgotten figure. But you can't touch him so he becomes more and more TV image. Okay, not TV, he's not shown on TV. Computer generated image, okay? And it's not good, of course... - for a politician.... - Virtual Khodorkovsky. Virtual Khodorkovsky. Exactly. Being outside of Russia, he really cannot influence situations here. He wants to be Jesus Christ, but, you know, he has a past. Over time, complicated stories become more simple. Shades of gray separate in the pools of black and white. That simplicity can serve a political purpose. In 1998, there were many suspects in the brutal killing of Mayor Luzhkov. From Chechen gangsters, to Mayor's wife. Today in Nefteyugansk, there is only one. Khodorkovsky's story marks the beginning of a journey which ultimately will result in violence. And this is where we are today. Where violence is the only truth. At your disposal for resolving social contradictions or political conflicts. In England, over the past 15 years, there have been a growing number of mysterious deaths related to Russia. Khodokovsky's lawyer was killed in a helicopter crash. The anti-Putin Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned to death. Six months after he delivered an affidavit, the Russian's Secret Services have paid for the murder of the mayor of Nefteyugansk Boris Berezovsky was found dead. His neck suspended by his own cashmere scarf. But the coroner was unable to conclude whether the hanging was a suicide or a murder. Berezovsky became consumed by this obsession that he was gonna bring down Putin from London. I would be very sad if Khodorkovsky went the same way Berezovsky did. I mean your life may be at risk in London. Did you have a conversation with your wife about continuing to speak out? I can't speak of Russia too much. One of the top Kremlin political aids, uh, said publicly, "There's no Russia without Putin." End of quote. Probably the most insulting thing I've ever heard said about my country. Vladimir Kara-Murza is a former journalist and anti-Putin political warrior. He was close to John McCain who asked him to be among those who carried his coffin. Kara-Murza was poisoned twice while on assignment for Khodorkovsky and Russia. He played a key role in passing the Magnitsky act which sanctions certain Russian individuals for human rights abuses. Kara-Murza now works with Khodorkovsky to provide research and offer advice to those considering sanctions on members of Putin's inner circle. We do have a new project of Open Russia called Dossier. It takes the investigative journalist down in Russia or outside of Russia and builds on that. A key focus is the circle of new oligarchs surrounding Putin. One of them is Yevgeny Prigozhin, nicknamed Putin's chef. Following a recipe of covert ops, the chef cooks up missions for Putin all over the world. Special Counsel Robert Mueller accused Prigozhin of launching cyberattacks during the 2016 presidential election. Others accused him of running off-the-books military operations from Ukraine to Africa. When Khodorkovsky funded a group of journalists to look into the matter, they were murdered. Reportedly by people working for the chef.. Back in Russia, state-controlled TV turns the story upside down, blaming Khodorkovsky for not doing more to protect the journalists. Open Russia also helped to expose a plot to kill a Russian double agent in Salisbury, England. The attack deployed a military chemical weapon which badly poisoned two people and killed an innocent bystander. Two members of the assassination team were spotted by British surveillance cameras and traced back through their driver's licenses to the GRU. Russian military intelligence. With a perfume bottle full of Novichok, a deadly nerve agent, they travelled to Salisbury on the day of the attack and then fled quickly back to Russia. That interview was sort of a double message saying, nothing is true. And of course we're lying. And two fingers up to the West. But we're still doing it. And it's okay to lie. It's negation of facts and negation of truth. Negation of reality. What kind of campaign is Sobchak running? Have you met her? And what do you think of her? How's the campaign going? - Smooth as it can be. - I understand. Miss Sobchak just advises me to take part in her campaign. She's doing things which make her a very few friends in the Krem, When there's a fence, we should understand, that all we see all this so-called campaign is a, is a criminal game. After years in prison, Khodorkovsky had learned how to play the long game. During the run of election theater, he wasn't trying to He was offering support to a number of political actors who could amplify democratic principles over time. Khodorkovsky wanted to speak by proxy to a younger generation and be ready for Russia after Putin. They don't watch so much TV. They surf the web, a domain the State is either been unwilling or unable to control. One web warrior, Alexei Navalny is supported by Khodorkovsky. Navalny is banned from TV or running for office. But he can get more than 20 million views on his YouTube channel. Why do you think that Putin finds you so dangerous or threatening? During election season, there is a march in honor of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who'd been murdered by mysterious gunmen in front of the Kremlin. Just a few days before he was to release evidence of Russia's involvement in violence in Ukraine. Preparations in government rules for the march made it more protest theater than protest. Only certain signs were allowed. And the tiny contention from Open Russia is not permitted to bring along it's posters. All the politicians showed up in the bitter cold. Ksenia Sobchak's family history haunted her campaign. Her father was the mayor of St. Petersburg who first hired Putin. Many believe Ksenia is a secret agent of the Kremlin. Maybe even Putin's goddaughter. In Russia, where visions of the future are blocked by an unchanging present under Putin, conversations turn quickly to the past. Putin looks back to days of empire and wants to make Russia great again. Russian liberals are nostalgic for the democratic freedoms of the 90s. But it's hard for them to argue in favor of the time when a handful of men control the economy and so many lived in fear of hunger, violence, and economic chaos. In such a past, wouldn't most people settle for a present under Vladimir Putin? In Russia's election theater, everyone knows how the story will end. Some actors play along and others improvise off a script. But for now, outside of the big cities, audiences seem happy enough with the fairytale promoted by Putin. And far off Krasnokamensk where Khodorkovsky spent so many years in prison, election theater has the folksy flair of a high school musical. Everyone roots for a happy ending. In a story scripted by the self-appointed man of the moment who claims to have saved them from the villains of the past. After Putin's next term, can you imagine that he will step down? Or do you think he will just keep going forever? Who knows? - Russia! Russia! Russia! - Russia! Russia! Russia! Putin is now 18 years in power. He has this group of friends around him who are now feverously rich and of course they don't wanna see him go. Their whole wealth comes only from him. It's very hard to get out of this. What do you think is Putin's worst nightmare? I wondered how Khodorkovsky could think that Putin was weak or fearful. After all, on the struggle between the two men, Khodorkovsky had lost. But while in prison, Khodorkovsky learned that you can sometimes win when you're willing to lose everything. The darker the night, the brighter the stars.
