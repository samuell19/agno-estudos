Hand in hand and heart to heart We don't stir a step If you're happy, I'm happy Love makes fools of us all! Step right up, ladies and gents! Hurry, seats are going fast! Don't push! Round and round we go and end up where we began! Gentlemen, try your luck! Come and try! Sir, you're back! What a pleasure to see you again! You can beat your record from yesterday! Gentlemen, step up! Step up and win a bottle! The young girl who was with you yesterday -- where is she? My daughter? She's around. She'll be back any time now. Run along now -- your boss will be yelling. One minute more ... Hey ... you're not thinking about Suzanne any more? You're the only thing that matters in my life. It's not much of a life, I know. You deserve better, but we'll get by, you'll see. Let's wait a bit. Trust me, H?l?ne! You don't know what you mean to me. More than Suzanne? Silly girl! I'm sick of your sweet talk. I don't know why I don't -- Step up, ladies and gents! Continuous showings, like the movies! Our jugglers, Missy and Sissy, learned their trade juggling books at the Ministry of Finance! Herman, our all-in wrestler, will meet all comers! Marvel at the youngest clown in the world! This phenomenon can swallow 43 eggs in 3 minutes! Hard-boiled! Our fearless lion tamer will display the magnificent Sultan, 280 kilos of ferocious feline, mane included! Look -- the guy from last night. What about him? And now, ladies and gents, the most sensational, most extraordinary, most dazzling act of equilibrium and acrobatics: Jean! Were you waiting for an invitation? Jean came direct from South America, hanging off the wing of a plane, to work with me -- because we work together! Right this way, sir! Try your luck at the lottery! Over here, sir! The lottery's for kids! For you, only 1 franc! Look what you can win on 1 franc down! 4, you win a mat! 7, a shoehorn! Step right up, fellas! 8, a porcelain bowl! 9, a doll! 10, the slut herself! Don't poach my customers! Me poach your customers? You turn their stomachs! I'm no hustler! Fat chance you'd have, with your fat face! Say that again, you thief! You're just a thief, you stole my man, you cow! He came of his own free will, he was sick of you! Look at that trollop's face! Chippy! Sow! You want a good slap? What's all this? H?l?ne, if you don't get back to the stand ...! Your new girl and your ex are brawling. Oh, why? I don't know, but it's some fight. You'll pay for that! Oh yeah? You don't scare me! I'll teach you, you filthy bitch! Cow! Look at my dress! Fat lot of difference that makes! I'm not taking that, not from a tart like her! Let go of me! Look at the state of you! Well, you had it coming! What did I do to deserve you? You seem to be injured. Why's he butting in? You a doctor? Water. Did you see that wildcat? Yes, I saw. Why bother bringing her up nicely if she gets into fights with trash like that! Hey, easy! - Have you any iodine? - Iodine? Why would I have iodine? He must be nuts. - Or hydrogen peroxide. - Hydro ...? - Thinks I'm a drugstore. - Alcohol, then. Alcohol? Why didn't you say so? You saw: she started it. Yes, I saw. There. This bandage will do, for now. I'll make you another in a little while. A little while? Yes. As we're having supper together. Supper together? Say, you're raving. That's her, officer! She attacked me, she started it! He can tell you, she started it! I saw nothing, I'm afraid. - For the love of -- - Some witness! You two can sort it out at the station house. Did you hear? The cops took both of them in. Ask around, you'll hear about her! She's a liar! - You'll pay for this! - Shut up! Say ... Ladies introduce themselves when entering the parlor! Don't be scared, come here. What happened to you? She jumped me for no reason! She stole my man! Is that true? Might I be so bold as to inquire what corner Madame works? We disgust Her Highness! - Look at her! - What a little priss! Got a stick up your ass? Well, speak up! Okay, sugarplum. Up! How many? 25 will do for today! What's the rumpus? Just having fun. That not allowed now? Help! Help! Yell all you like, you're ours! H?l?ne Laurent? What's wrong with you? You're free. Thank you. If it were up to me, you'd still be in jail. - You can thank Mr. Vautier. - Who? Go on, beat it! Would you care to get in, Mademoiselle H?l?ne? - Whose car is this? - Mr. Vautier's. - Where are we going? - To Mr. Vautier's. We'll have supper together after all. You're Vautier? You get me arrested and then you get me out? My apologies. It was the only way I could get you to accept my invitation. Hey, the door's locked! Yes. I thought you'd prefer not to be disturbed. There. Madame est servie. You talking to me? I am indeed. There. Now we can start. Start if you like, I'm not eating. As you please. I won't force you. Caviar? No? Ah well. I thought you'd like it. I'll take some myself, if you don't mind. Would you care for a canap?? No? Pity. A little p?t?, perhaps? Lobster? Look at this fine claw. You keep stuffing yourself, it's disgusting! Feel free to join me. I won't touch a thing! Not a thing! I knew you'd have supper with me sooner or later. I will, then! Try and stop me. Do you remember those first moments The birds were singing on the boughs It was an evening in spring An evening on the dole Don't get worked up. Women are all alike. At your age! Shame! Don't get your bowels in an uproar, pal! You talking to me? Love makes fools of us all Love worries us so We gaze into each other's eyes ... Was the coffee to your taste? - Hell yeah! Oops, sorry. - Not at all. You're a funny guy, though. How do I say it? - An old devil. - You said it, not me! But it suits you. So okay ... You got me out of jail, you fixed everything ... just to have supper with little old me? Not just to have supper with little old you. - Oh, I get it. - No, it's not what you think. I'm more demanding than that. I want to keep you. Oh, really? Are we talking true love? No. At my age ... that's hardly a word to be used. What, then? Perhaps an experiment that interests me. - I don't understand. - There's nothing to understand. If you'd care to stay, this place is yours. Mine? What about you? Oh, I don't live here. - But -- - Don't speak, you'd say no. Not just because you want to say no, but out of pride. I don't find that displeasing. There. You are free. And if ever you should need me -- who knows? -- I'm in the book. Here. Keep it. You might come back. - I'd be surprised. - I wouldn't. Hey! Wait! Where have you been? - Jean! - Where have you been? What's it to you? You didn't come looking for me. - I got out by myself. - And then? - What then? - Yes, then! Was that the police chief's limousine? Spying on me? ... Let go, that hurts. - What have you been doing? - Ow! I was a fool to talk of love with a slut like you. Jean, listen -- I work and you hustle! Suzanne was right, you're just a tart! They should have kept you in jail with the others! You're just a whore, that's all -- a whore! A tramp out of the gutter! I should spit in your face! Filth, do you hear? Filth! I didn't sleep well at all ... Get up! I'm not going to fetch your water after you've been in the jug! Alley-oop, princess! Thinking of your Jean? No-talent little snot that he is! Waste of your time! Little skirt-chaser! Wasting your time over him, when you could have a gentleman! Like the one last night! All he wants is your good and honor, I'm sure. And to help your poor mother. Oh, if only ... I were five years younger ... Not to mention ... the old fellow has charm! Old ... who says old? He's got class. He's got to be a dentist, at the very least. Finally, gentlemen, we inject adrenaline -- alcohol please -- in the cardiac cavity of this little creature -- iodine -- and, I hope, save its life. In the present case, I'm sure of the result. The professor seems to have gotten to bed late again. The heart must be monitored closely as well as blood pressure. But he looks good -- congrats. Mind your own business. Tell me what's important in today's mail. You're named honorary professor at the University of Copenhagen. Think that's important? The prefect's wife wants you to operate on her sister. She knows I don't practice now. Professor Rajet is coming to see you. I'm out to everyone -- no interruptions! There. This method is my own and, I admit, imperfect. It is to be used only in case of extreme emergency: deep shock, internal hemorrhage, hemophilia, and, especially, heart attack under anesthesia. Then, quickly, adrenaline injection and, for transfusions, directly into the donor's arm, and thus into the subject's heart, shocking a weakened or lazy organ into working again. - What was that? - Nothing -- a little female asking for you. - I want to see Mr. Vautier. - But I tell you he's out! You let go of me! And be polite! I'm not just anyone. I came in a taxi! It's you, Mademoiselle. What a pleasant surprise. You see, I was right to expect your return. I didn't dare hope it would be so soon. It was most kind of you to accept my invitation. Pardon me -- I have work to do. Mademoiselle will take care of you, she has her instructions. - But I wanted to ask -- - Later. But -- but -- What a way to treat a girl! Deer Mamma, Forgive mee for going wivout warnning - I will see my girl! - I have no orders -- Orders! Do you know who I am? Madame, I cannot let you enter! Buzz off! Chump! Oh, Madame -- he's trying to stop a mother -- H?l?ne! Is it really you? - What have they been doing to you? - Nothing, Mama! - Are you kidding? - No! - The past four days have been a dream. - And him? I haven't seen him since I got here. Take me for an idiot? I won't have this! They've locked you up! They kept you from me! I'll find the villain if I have to break down the walls! Don't put yourself to such trouble, Madame. I'm sorry to intrude without warning. Would you kindly allow me a few minutes with your mother? It won't take long -- I'll call you back in. Shame! You seduced my daughter! You stole her! What's to become of me? I'll go to the police! A girl I raised like a saint! If you've come for your daughter, Madame, please take her! Wait! Let's talk this over. No need to get angry -- but a mother has rights! Tell me ... What do they dream of -- women of your age, of about ... about 45, 46 ... - 42! - As old as that? You don't look it. What do they dream of, young women of your age ... if not of their old age, an ivy-covered house, a garden with its flowers, a vegetable plot, a shed with a cow -- - Why a cow? - Why indeed? Two! You'll have two. - Is there a pigeon house? - We'll build one. And ... in the house ... will there be ... A cellar? Red, white, port, whiskey ... The house ... The house will be ... in my name? Your trust is touching! 10:00 tomorrow at my solicitor's, Mr. Pommier, Rue Richelieu. - We'll sign the papers there. - Mr. Pommier. And then, in your cosy little nest, you can live in peace and quiet, no longer worrying about what no longer concerns you. There! It's in the best interest of both of us. Decent people can always come to an agreement! People of a certain class ... Well ... that's settled! Put her there. I should say goodbye to her ... Perhaps the two of you should be spared a painful moment. - Think so? - I'm sure. As you like! You're a classy guy. Goodbye! Ah! I forgot! You'll come see me there? - Where? - My place! But of course. Till then! - Mama left? - Did you want to ask her anything? - Yes, I would have liked -- - What? - To ask for news about -- - A friend? No, a relative. It doesn't matter! I'm not going. Are you nuts? We've got to open in Mantes! Maybe you. Not me. - You're crazy! - I've got business here. You can do what you like. Get a load of old Ma Laurent in her glad rags! That booth is a goldmine, I tell you! I made my pile there! All this! - In six months you can retire! - Yeah? You've got yourself a bargain! I'll just pack up my bits of stuff. Hey! What's going to happen to me? So it's like that ... Come into a fortune, Mme. Laurent? If anyone asks, none of their business. I'm selling up and getting out. And H?l?ne? She's just fine where she is, thank you. You leave her be. Okay, okay ... - She's happy? - I should say so! And I take it she didn't ask about me? About you! My poor boy, she doesn't give a damn! - She's finally got her head straight. - Right you are. Say, Jean ... Given my new position, where I need to be dignified, if you don't mind, I'd like you to call me "Madame." Oh really? Let's see. You mean that now, when I meet you, I should call you "Madame." Right. Very good. But ... today ... just for today ... can I still speak familiarly? - Certainly. - Thanks. Up yours, Madame! Jeannot! Well? You can tell them we're going to Mantes. No! I knew you wouldn't let a pal down! - Do you recognize her? - She's seen everywhere! - What a transformation! - And in such a short time! No. 228, Portrait of a Society Woman, Mme. H.L., by Tassini. A society woman! When you consider what she was only two years ago! Careful! Devaldi's over there. You're behind the times! She's not with him any more -- now it's Barnave, the golf player. And that old devil Vautier is still keeping her? SOLD Treaty of Westphalia? 1648. Rocroi? 1645. Ah no! 1643. - If you say so. - And what was Louis XIV called? The ... what? ... king ... Sun king! - And why? - Because of the baths. - Baths? - He invented the sun bath. Please be serious. Now tell me: What were Louis XIV's most famous victories? Let's see ... Mlle. de Fontanges, Mlle. de La Valli?re, Mme. de Montespan, - Mme. de Maintenon -- - Please! To hell with your history! Sit down. Have you been studying? - F! - How can I improve? I only see you four hours a week, and then you make fun of me! Poor little you! What's wrong? Nothing. We're never alone. Come in! Pardon my interruption. I thought the lesson was done. Yes, we had finished, actually. If you wouldn't mind waiting a moment in ... - in the drawing room. - Certainly. Hurry, we'll be late. You've never been to Greece? Lovely country. A young professor would benefit by a stay in the birthplace of the arts. I've taken the liberty of reserving a cabin for you on the Portos -- a fine ship! -- which is setting off on a long cruise. ... No, no buts! I believe Mlle. Laurent's knowledge of history is sufficiently --- - but, Sir -- - nay, amply -- developed. Not that I'm dissatisfied! I hired you to teach history, but also to make it ... interesting! You've done an excellent job. Thank you. Don't forget your cheque. - But this is far too much -- - It is I who thank you! Were you there? Why aren't you dressed? Your teacher asked me to convey his farewell homage. - He left to travel in Greece. - Why did he leave? You had nothing more to learn. He left like all the others. The dance teacher you gave me. Or the young man who taught bridge, who was called to Spain! The fencing master! The golf teacher who pissed off after a week! H?l?ne, "piss off" -- what an expression. - "To leave." He left. - To America! - He left "for" America. - "For," then! To hell with it! I'm a lady! I'm petted, spoiled, admired! But sometimes I'm just sick of it! Sick! Sick! Sick! Brandy, grenadine, mint? - You set up these -- - Distractions? ... Gin? You set them up and you knock them down! You can't object to taking advantage of my connections ... and experience. Experiments! Don't be silly, you mean everything to me. I can't make a move without you knowing about it. You can't blame me for that. It's sometimes sad to be my age ... trying to hold on to a very young woman. Too young. Some moments are very hard, very pitiable, but despite everything worthy of respect. Let's move on. We're lunching with the Minister of Fine Arts. Your delicious negligee might surprise him. - But -- - I'd suggest your beige suit. - With my fox furs? - Yes indeed! If you don't mind, let's not dine tonight. I've reserved a box at the Empire. What's next? John and Jack. Clowns? Acrobats. What were their names, again? Jack and John. Where shall we have supper afterwards? Guillaume Vautier requests the pleasure of Mssrs. John and Jack's company at supper, Caf? ... - For two? - Four. Why four? I thought you'd enjoy the company of some music hall performers. Really? Who? H?l?ne! - Gentlemen? - Mr. Vautier's table. This way, sir. Don't worry, I'm here. Pardon me for not inviting you in person. Dear sir, how kind of you. We are overwhelmed ... ... so rare to be appreciated! Mes hommages! - May I introduce ... - Jean. Well, let's sit down! Madame next to Monsieur ... me here, and Jean there! Pommery sec, caviar, and flowers for the lady! Sausage for me -- and the bill for Monsieur! Good thing I'm here to keep you all laughing! Hey, how long's this break? When's the band coming back? Sir, it's 4:00. They're sleeping. Some nerve! Am I sleeping? STAY I'LL COME BACK Let's go. Already? Yes, I'm tired. May we drive you home? No thanks, we'll stay a bit longer. - Oh no! - Yes. I'm sure we'll meet again soon. Coming? But you haven't said good night to these gentlemen. I have! Pardon me. My mistake. - Another bottle. - Very good, sir. There's a good idea! Don't sit, you're leaving. - I'm leaving? - Yes, I tell you! All right, don't get excited, I get it. Not a very nice thing to do to your partner, though! Your alter ego, as they say in Spanish. That means "your other self." Your "half and half," as they say in English. Yes, your fifty percent! I'm waiting for someone. We'd like to be left alone. Don't disturb us. Very good, sir. Just a splash for me. Pardon me -- H?l?ne forget her bag. Such a scatterbrain. Fortunately, I realized she'd left it. She would have noticed once she got home ... and come back to get it. Allow me. Peekaboo! There it is. Thank you. You expected H?l?ne. H?l?ne? But I turned up. How disappointing. What do you want, anyway? I have the right to meet a friend. Am I your friend? For me, a friend is someone who must share your private life -- - Your private life? - For a few months. Are you making fun of me? Me? Oh, no. - You don't know H?l?ne. - True. No. You don't know her. When she's interested in someone, she needs him with her constantly, It's necessary to her. Fated. So, the visits ... you'll pay her -- which I permit you to pay her -- will be more frequent than you think. How kind of you to give me your permission. But, if I want to see ... - H?l?ne? - H?l?ne. I'll do it without your permission. - Child. - Sir? It's not an insult! Rather, a tribute to your youth. I'm sorry you're not my age. So am I. You'd be happy to do me some damage. - I'd like to knock -- - -- me down a peg? - your choppers out. - Teeth. - If you like. - No. Justice lacks manpower. Pity. There's plenty of work for it. And now, sir, I think the only thing for you to do ... is go. I go. I go. Ah ... a small detail. Her address is 96 avenue de Madrid. To save you looking. Till we meet again! For we will. Perhaps sooner than you think. Ah! That must be H?l?ne. What are you waiting for? You won't answer? That's not nice. The poor dear's getting impatient. How cruel. I've been trying to get through for ten minutes. The Alcazar -- at last Would you get Mr. -- What? No one there? You're sure? Well, thank you. Jean, I'm so glad! Come in. Tell me what you've been doing. Nice place. - He gave you all this? - Yes. But I couldn't be really happy without you. What's wrong? Just looking around. And seeing. Clearly, you regret nothing. - Perhaps your freedom. - But I've never been so free! Just a minute. Who's there? Who do you think, my dear? Don't worry, it's only me. How did you get in? The silliest way in the world -- through the door. You had the key? Yes, your key. It was in your bag. Pardon me, I brought it back. I didn't want you to worry. Guess where it was! Under the tablecloth, as though the waiter hid it. I'm sorry to have disturbed you. I'll be going. Your hands are cold. Why are you trembling? Allow me -- I'll close the window. It's too cool to leave it open. And imprudent -- you're on the first floor. Aren't you nervous being alone? I wish you had a man with you tonight. Don't you want me to stay with you? Well, you're not the nervous type. I'll be off. But if a burglar wanted to get in, he could simply climb a tree. If he were any kind of acrobat -- but I'll be off. Just that he would only have to jump to the windowsill -- You were there, sir? I said we'd be seeing each other soon. You're just a bit earlier than expected. Don't worry, my dear. Jean has said he respects my age. Lucky you reminded me. But you're wrong for once. I'm not the thief here. I'm not stealing H?l?ne. You took her from me. She was my mistress before she was yours. You didn't know? There are things you don't know! Yes! We were happy together. Those memories can't be erased by money or presents or power. I know you're well armed, you've got everything to offer. But if H?l?ne chooses to follow me, she'll want for nothing. Do you hear me, H?l?ne? If you want me, I can take you away. To Madrid, where I'm playing. The 1:30 express. Be at the station tomorrow. Don't answer now -- do what you want. I'll be waiting. I'll be waiting. That's all. I'll be waiting. Well, that's clear. You heard him. It's him or me -- as they say in novels. I don't think you'll hesitate. What can I give you? As the charming young man said, money, presents, connections. And he? Love, youth, adventure. You won't hesitate. I know, you're rather fond of me, but what is fondness towards an old fellow like me? Well -- best of luck! I won't go. Yes, yes, you will. - I won't go! - Very well, you won't go. But, if you change your mind, remember The Madrid express leaves at 1:30. From the Gare d'Orsay. I won't go. I won't go. She will, she won't ... she will, she won't ... She won't. No lunch for you today? Not getting picked up? I see! The lovebirds are on the outs! Madame is sulking! - Lovers quarrels! - Hush, you annoy me. Someone's cross! Is this more serious? - The experiment failed, for once? - Shut up. Drop that cigarette! It's terrible for you. All over? The bird has flown? One lost, ten found! Dr. Gautier won't have any problem -- Strange sight! Can it be the Doctor is sad? I forbid you to talk to me in that tone! Get out, you pest! What right does she have? I ask you! The nerve! Tears, now? Come, come. Most surprising. Do people like us have the right to go soft? Dry those tears, they're grotesque. Self-control. One lost ... ten found. You'll see, it's a swell town. Nothing like what you're used to, but you'll have a great time. People love us, we travel everywhere, easy living -- sleeping cars, the lot! I'm so happy I can show you the sights! Excuse me, Madame, your compartment is ready. Well, good night! Am I supposed to sleep in the corridor? Always draw the short straw ... Well, Jacquot, don't you want to go to bed? I don't know why people travel in first class. All that dust in the cushions of those so-called chic compartments. Here it's good clean wood. Much better! And you get company. It's intimate. You make friends. I really prefer it. They did whistle, but maybe because they liked us. Like in America. - Hungry? - No, thanks. I'm hungry, Mamma, I want to eat too! - Later, later. - I'm hungry! Thank you, sir. He loves ham. Aw, look at the kid. Could you open the window? I'm stifling. Would you mind my opening the window, Madame? Aren't there enough drafts already? What's wrong? Aren't you feeling well? Give me a cigarette. Hey, this isn't a smoking compartment. What's the matter with H?l?ne? There you go. Is this a life for a woman like her? You know how things have been for us lately? Your work's been lousy since she came back. Being in love is great, but not in our line of work. Look how long we've been working on the new act. You've got no drive, no oomph. All right, how much time do you think we need to get it in shape? If you'd put your back in it, really put your back it, we could open at the Empire in three weeks. That's enough! Clear the stage! Acrobats onstage! Jeannot! - You ready? - Coming! Keep an eye out and tell me if anything looks off. Because ... if this act doesn't work ... Hello! When I found out you were here, I couldn't resist the pleasure ... - I'm so glad to see you again! - Yes. You haven't changed a bit. A little thinner, but it suits you. A little paler, too. Even more charming. And the hairdo? - I haven't ... - No need to ask if you're happy! - Your face is an open book. - Yes. - And he's still as successful? - Can't complain! It must have been a wonderful tour. - I can just imagine -- - Guillaume. What do you say, H?l?ne? H?l?ne! H?l?ne! Where'd she go? H?l?ne! - Weren't you watching? - Yes, I was just going to find you. - What did you think? - It was good, very good. You don't sound very enthusiastic. But I am! I know it'll be a hit. Hush! Don't jinx it! I'll go get dressed. What's up? You look bummed. - Kinda. - The act? Another act I just saw. Don't like it. Who? I was getting smokes in the foyer and I saw -- Who? Vautier! Vautier? - You're crazy. - It was him. - You're seeing things. - I wish. Even if it were him, what would that prove? Where was he? Exit door. You're alone! - Thank goodness. - Why, what's up? Nothing! I just imagined for a minute that Vautier was here. Vautier? Crazy, no? - Shall we get something to eat? - If you like. - Say, H?l?ne -- - What now? Look at me. - Suppose Vautier tried to get you back. - Oh! Just suppose. - Okay. What about it? - What do you mean? - I won't have him talking to you. - This is so stupid -- - You wouldn't answer him? - No! - You'd send him away? - Of course! Well, then! Let's get something to eat. Say, on the subject ... I want to ask you one more thing. I'm listening. If one day you ... if you should meet Vautier ... Swear you wouldn't speak to him. You'd turn your back on him. Oh, Jean, come on ... - I'd feel better. - Got another token? Yes, but -- say "I swear." "I swear" -- okay? This way, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor to present the famous trapeze duo, performing a double somersault! They will then repeat it -- blindfolded and without a net! We ask for utter silence for this particularly dangerous act, performed tonight for the first time! Allow me, my dear. Guillaume, go away! He can't see me. What's going on? Forget about it. If you're not feeling good, don't do it. Go on, hurry. Hello! Give me Emergency Services! Emergency Services? Serious accident at the Empire -- send an ambulance, quick! Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen -- the accident wasn't serious. Return to your seats and the show will go on. Jeannot, tell me what's wrong. Speak to me. Where does it hurt, pal? Do you hear me? It's me! Jeannot! An injured man was just brought in. This is his wife. Come quick. They're about to operate. Pardon, sir, I work with the patient. Is it serious? - I can't say anything yet. - Please, doctor, the truth! He's in bad shape, very bad. But don't give up hope. In any case, he's in the best of hands. In his condition, an operation could be fatal. - Think so? - Pardon me, but his pulse is very low. - Don't you think -- - I think we must try the impossible. Hurry up, now! Amazing -- Vautier back in action! That old devil of a Vautier! He was in the audience when it happened. I thought he didn't practice now. - He must have changed his mind. - He insisted on doing this operation. Jacques, we must do something! He'll kill him! Chloroform ... chloroform!
