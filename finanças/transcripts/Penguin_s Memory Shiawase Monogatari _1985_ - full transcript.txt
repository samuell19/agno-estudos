A Penguin's Memories A Tale of Happiness Tom! It's me. How was it? It looks like we've been completely separated. How is Tom? His wounds aren't bad, but he's a little feverish. If we could give him a cold beer, he'd get better in no time. Mike! Mike! I'm right here, Tom. Mike, where's Al? I'm over here. Do you think we'll make it back home? Yeah, we will. We absolutely will. What now? We'll look around tomorrow morning and try to rejoin the main force. That's all we can do. That book again? Yeah. You're an odd one, you know that? I'm amazed you can read a book in this situation. I'm reading it because we're in this situation. I don't get it. When bullets are flying on the battlefield, what good will that book do you? When the cannons fire, are you going to cover your head with it? Mike. Hm? Do you have a girl back home? No. You? I do. She's blond, busty, and beautiful. And on top of that, she's a rich man's daughter. I'm jealous. Yeah. Only it's a one-sided crush, so she ain't waiting for me. Hey, Mike. When we get back home, let's do something together. Sure, that sounds nice. Let's do it. With Tom too. Yeah, with this guy too. Those are friendly choppers! Okay, let's go. Stop! Stop! Mike! Don't shoot! Sto- Mike! Tom! Tom, are you okay? Damn it! Mike! Mike, it's Tom! Tom! Tom! Mike, let's go! Tom! Mike! Tom. Mike! Hang in there! Al? Al! Big Brother. Mike. Welcome home. The hero returns. You're the same as ever. I'm glad you made it back. Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Oh dear. Anne... Anne, is that you? Mike, we got married. I see. I had no idea. Congratulations.

To put it simply... Well... It was just a battlefield. Oh, Mike, don't keep us in suspense. Just tell us. Um... Big Brother? What's wrong, Mike? Tell us already. Mike. It's for you. Hey, Paul. I've been waiting. Yeah. Right now? Okay. Sure, let's have a good long talk. Mike! Oh, are you okay? Yeah. I'm glad you made it back. Come on in. This way. Hey, what is it? Mike! Welcome back! Hurray for Mike! Mike! So Mike, how many did you kill? It's gotta feel great, killing. Hey, you must've been lonely. Hey, Mike. Mike, I know you're tired, but tell us a little. Your aunts and uncles came all this way. I've been telling you all this time. I just fought in the war, got injured, and came back. No, you must have distinguished yourself to be able to come back. Please tell us your war stories. There was nothing out of the ordinary, really. Mike! Big Brother. Mike! What're you doing in this dump? You're the town hero now! I'm no hero. When you go back to the battlefield, distinguish yourself even more, you hear! We're counting on you! Where do you think he went? He's been acting strange lately. Coming through.

Don't any of you have the courage? Well done. Well done. Very well done. You? Don't do it. Don't do it. You'll just get hurt, don't. Don't do it, I'm telling you. Looks like he's serious.

This way. Are you a traveler? Yes. Seeking an end to his travels, the traveler sets out traveling once more. His only luggage is the setting sun. Oh. From Randall James' third collection, right? Yes, yes. You're right. This is a nice town. Especially after you've been traveling for a long time. Hiring Librarians Why choose such a plain job? I've loved books since I was young. I always wanted to live surrounded by books. Hm... As I was saying earlier, we don't pay very well. I know. Your predecessor's apartment happens to be available. Come see me tomorrow at 9:00. Thank you. Forceps. Scalpel. Wait! Doctor. You'll be fine now. He really fought to get through that difficult operation. Thank you. Hm, this should be perfect. I'm pleased to have such a talented surgeon. Thank you. By the way, Jack, I think it's about time I had a talented son-in-law too. Would you like to sort things out with Jill sometime soon? Yes, Director. I wanted to ask you about that too. Oh, so you were. Excuse me. Hey, Susan. We can't. Not here. Jack, that boy will be fine now. Of course he will. These hands are never wrong. Let's drink to your hands tonight. Okay? I'll be waiting at the apartment. Okay. Thank you. Please, take your time. Oh, gosh. Welcome. Welcome. Jill! I see. Then your father's preoccupied with thinking about your wedding. He is. That's why he told me to stop teaching the children to sing and to focus on becoming a good wife. I can't possibly tell him that I want to be a singer. You really do want to become a pro, huh? I'm serious about it. It's not easy. There's a lot of pain involved. That's fine. I can handle it. Well, why not go for it? Audition. What? Audition? A record producer from Central City wandered in here a little while ago. He said he was looking for new artists. So I told him a little about you. He seemed interested. Really, Madam? I'd like to try it. It would be a two- or three-day trip, but if you're interested, I can contact him right away. I'm happy to hear that. Thank you, Madam. Ah, the smell of books. I love it. Hm? Lend me this! Sure, sure. Let me see it a moment. Um, I'm looking for a poetry collection, but I don't know the title. Okay. I often come here running errands for my father, but I haven't borrowed many books for myself. Hm... Let's see... "Below the Mirabeau bridge flows the Seine," right? Yes, yes. "And of our love, I am reminded" is the next line, I believe. Yeah, that's Apollinaire. "Joy always came following pain." I see. A lovely poem, don't you think? I heard it from a friend, but I've always wanted to read it myself. Thank you. There was never such a knowledgeable and considerate person here before. No. I'm Jill. You? Mike. If there are any other good books, let me know, okay? Sure. Bye. Jill, huh? It's a nice name. Mike. I'm not offering this to return the favor, but I can show you around the area, if you'd like. Oh, thank you, Jill. Well, see you again next time, Mike. Hey. Hey! Come in, come in, come in. Oh my. Is your princess out again? There! There! You're hopeless! I hear you're teaching those children to sing. Oh, I wouldn't call it teaching. I'm just playing with them. You like singing, huh? Yes, I love it. Actually, someone I know lets me sing at her restaurant occasionally. Wow. Then will you become a pro in the future? I doubt it! It's a dream. A dream within a dream. Still, it would be nice to be able to live off my singing. I think that, sometimes. There! Ow! Ow! How is it? Do you like this town? Yeah. It seems like a lovely place. How's the sandwich? It's great. Glad to hear it. But in my case, as long as it's not field rations, pretty much anything tastes good. You were in the Delta War, huh? Yeah. I thought you might have been. There are two places that I want to visit during my lifetime. Two of them? One is Mount Jeffry. It's a plateau with farms everywhere. The other is... Sunset Beach. The sandy beach stretches out endlessly, with no sign of anyone around. Those are two very different places, aren't they? Actually, before I came to this town, I made it to the fork in the road leading to Mount Jeffry and Sunset Beach. And? Well, this is being overly dramatic... but both places felt like the finish line for my journey. In the end, I turned back, unable to go to either. I see. Well, I hope you'll be able to go someday. Yeah. Oh no, I'm late! Oh, Jill. Hm? Have you thought about what we discussed? What we discussed? About Jack. He's quite a talented fellow. He works hard and is from a good family. You're starting to get older, you know. I'm heading out. It has a sad tone. It's a memento from a war buddy. Hey. Yuck! Ow. Over here, Jill. Okay. You seem even more chipper than usual today. Oh, you can tell? I have something special to tell you. This is the producer from PVC Record I was telling you about, Mr. Bob Adams. Nice to meet you. I'm Bob Adams. Call me Bob. It's a pleasure. I was keeping it a secret, but Bob came to hear you sing a little while ago. "If she's that good, I'd like her to attend our next audition," he said. Did you? You're amazing. You'll do just fine. I fell for your singing right away. This is your chance, Jill. Please take care of me. Oh, just leave it to me. You insist on going? Please, Daddy. I doubt I could stop you. Bye. Take care. Have no fears. No fears, okay? Really, you have nothing to fear. There, you'll be fine now. Here. Good, good. What are you thinking? Nothing, really. That's a lie. You're thinking about Jill, right? Or maybe about that naughty boy at the library. Stop.

Keep working hard. Jill. Take care. When everything's ready, I'll come straight to Lake City. You take care. Okay. The future superstar, Jill. You're fabulous. Thank you. Don't forget to do your vocal exercises every day. Okay! Leave the rest to me! Take care. You be careful. Finally, luck is on my side. The future superstar, the goose that lays golden eggs, Jill! Oh, Jill! Yes, this is the library. Oh, Jill. Welcome home. I knew you'd be there. But the library's closed today, isn't it? Yes, but... I had nowhere else to be. So how was the audition? A success. A huge success! I passed the audition. Really? Congratulations. Thank you. What? You want to celebrate? Well, at Madam O'Hara's restaurant then. Sure, sure. Tonight. Yeah, see you then. You must be Mike. Yes. It's fine. Jill will be coming out soon. Ah. You have a look in your eyes that I haven't seen in a long time. Huh? Long ago... Long, long ago, someone looked at me like that.

For passing your audition, and one more thing. One more thing? To celebrate the lovely romance between you two. Oh my, Auntie. Go ahead, now. I'm just in the way. Take your time and enjoy yourselves. Jill. Mike. Hey, you two. It's beautiful to see two young people so close... but I don't think I can abide a homewrecker. A homewrecker? Now, my lady, your knight has come for you. Let us be going. What are you doing, Jack? Just come. Stop that. The time for sweet, childish dreams is over. What? Come. Stop! Take your hand off me. That was a good punch. Get out. If you don't, I'll... You're spirited. However, you're the one who'll be leaving. What? Listen up. Jill is my fiancée. Her daddy approves of our relationship too. It's not like that, Mike. It is. Why don't you try asking her father? Stop spouting baseless nonsense. It's not like that, Mike. You're a drifter. Are you confident that you can make Jill happy? How about it? Now, the time for playing around is over. Mike! Don't go! Mike! You're awful, just awful, Jack! Jill. Mike. Mike, it's me. It looks like he's not back yet. Thank you. Sir, any requests? Let's see. Could you give me something really upbeat? I sure can. A gloomy face doesn't suit a young person. That's right. Mike. Hey, Chico. Want to go traveling together? Mike, phone for you. Okay. From Jill. Ah. I'm a little preoccupied. Tell her I'm not here. Hm? Mike. Mike, it's me. Mike, are you there? Mike. Mike! Mike! Let's go! Let's go. Jill! Jill. Wasn't Mike there? No. Okay, let's all eat this cake together. Hurray! Aren't you going to give it to Mike? It's fine. Okay, I want to eat chocolate cake! Chico, come out. Good, good. Good boy. I'm glad you're feeling better. You don't need to stay in that cramped cage anymore. Now, fly! Chico. How about it? Why not stop for a smoke? We don't have anything to talk about. Don't be like that. Have a seat. It's good to watch the falling golden leaves regretfully, once in a while. Jack, I haven't met her since, and I haven't talked with her either. Of course, I intend to keep it that way. I know. Now, sit down. Or what? Do you hate doctors so much you can't even sit next to one? To tell you the truth, I hate this season. The falling leaves may suit a poet, but they don't suit a doctor. Were you in the air or on land? Hm? In the Delta War. I was in the army. What area were you fighting in? East River. There was heavy fighting there, huh? It was hell. You've never seen anything like it. I was south of the East River. As an army physician, though. Even now, I hear the soldiers crying "Mom!" one last time as they were about to die. Mike, that was a lie. What I said about my engagement with Jill. Nothing's been formally decided. Do you truly love Jill? Are you confident you can make her happy? If you could immediately say "Yes," you'd either be full of yourself or a huge liar. I hear that in the Far East, China has a 4,000 year history of war. Egypt and Mesopotamia too. Even though the whole world knows it's foolish, we've gone to war again and again. In all that despair, why do you think we've been able to live on? It's love. We never ran away from love. We could never close our hearts to love. Mike, you mustn't run away. Running away won't solve anything. Running away from love... is impossible. Mike, make Jill happy for me. Jack. You're a better match for her than I am. And I have someone I need as well. Jack, I... They say a crab digs its holes to suit its shell. I think I could stand to learn from those crabs. Bye. Mike, have you ever seen a sentimental doctor? This season doesn't suit me. Hey. It's been a while. You seem well too. I have you to thank for that. I'll have what she's having. And? What did you want to talk about? Actually, it's about Jill. About Jill? What about Jill? Well... Jill is tormenting herself right now. Over that young man, Mike? Do you dislike Mike? No. No, I think he's a good young man. However, when I think about Jill's future... If two people in love are separated, do you think they'll be able to have a happy future? There are many different outcomes. Like us, in the past? Well, this girl, she can do it. Absolutely. Yes. Huh? It's fine, it's fine! She can start recording soon. She's good! Yes, her looks are amazing. This is a rare opportunity. Let's run with it. We'll make a killing. That's right. Yes. You've got it. Take it! I am number one! I'm making the big bucks! Yes, I am. Go on, take it! Go, go, go! Have as many bills as you want. Thank you! Thank you! Take them! Have as many as you want! Jill, baby, I'm counting on you. A poster of me. I can't believe it. Jill, it's lovely! Thank you. We've got to hurry and show this to Mike! Let's go! Hey, Jill! Come on, hurry! It's a poster! A poster! Yay! Mike. Hey. It's been a while. I have something to show you. May I come in? Sure. Well? It's pretty. It's very pretty. Will you put it up somewhere? Of course. I'll look at it every day. Oh, I'm glad to hear it! Chico, long time no see. It's me, remember? I'm going to be able to live by singing every day. Just like you. Hey, can I open this? Huh? Yeah. Chico won't run away anymore. I see. Jill. What? Should we go out for a bit? Okay. How about we go for a drive? Sure. Mike, come on, hurry! Hey, Mike. Will you come with me? I'm already with you. No, that's not what I mean. To Central City. There's no point in me going to Central City. I have no reason to go there. Wouldn't living with me be a reason for you? Listen, when I get to Central City, I'm going to do my very best. You won't have to do anything. You can read the books you like as much as you like. And then... Then? I'll look for my mom. Your mom? She's still alive? The truth is, she left. Probably for Central City. It was more than twenty years ago, though. But maybe, just maybe, I can meet her. Then I'll ask you to meet her too. I'm sure she'll love you. She's my mom, after all. Then we'll all live together happily. I'll have an adorable baby. Please, Mike. Come to Central City with me. I can't, Jill. I can't go there. Why not? I'm satisfied with my life here. Jill, don't think about me. You can go by yourself. Why, Mike? I don't understand. Do you dislike me? Mike. Why do you think I left my hometown? I've had enough of that! Mike. I want to live a quiet life. Then what about me? What's with you? Quiet this, quiet that. The world isn't like the inside of a library. You only live once, you know! What's wrong with testing how far your talent can take you? I'm saying that you should. And I'm saying that to do it, I need you. Listen, Jill. This is a once in a lifetime chance for you. Forget about me and work hard! Why are you trying to act cool? You just lack courage! You're afraid of being adventurous! Think what you like about me. But you have a dream, to be a singer- Stop it! That's enough. Jill, what I'm trying to say is... Jack. How is he? That patient. Yeah. He's doing quite well. Impressive work. You do fine work, Jack. Thank you. How about my patient? Hm? This guy here. Ah. On the path to recovery. He's back to how he used to be. I'm glad to hear it. It's thanks to my brilliant doctor. Do you think those two are doing well together? Who knows? I wonder. I hope they have a good doctor too. What's wrong, Auntie? Oh, Jill. I feel so empty lately. Auntie. Have you seen Mike? No, I've given up on that stubborn fool. Then you'll be alone in Central City. But... Sit down over there. Jill, I had dreams of being a singer once. I was given an offer to put out a record. Back then, I was married. My husband was a talented doctor. His dream was to build a hospital in his hometown. For me... when it came to becoming a singer, I may not have really cared either way. Of course, I said to him, "Come with me." What did your husband say? "Go by yourself." And so... in exchange for giving up the warmth of family, all I had left... was one record that never sold and lonely memories of Central City. Central City? Then... Um... Um... Mom? Jill. Mom! Jill! My Jill. Mom. I'm sorry for never telling you before. I promised your father... that I wouldn't say I was your mother. Mom... But you know, when I saw that you might take the same path I did, I started to worry. Mom... Well, Jill, can you forget Mike? I can't. I really do love him, after all. Jill. This is my first request as your mother. Don't let Mike go. Mike loves you too. Mom... Today I'll have all the wine I can drink. I'll give up on being a singer. Hm? That's right! I can sing without becoming a professional. You really won't regret it? I don't know. Maybe I will. But... I want to grab hold of a greater happiness. Yes. Yes, Jill. Ow, ow, ow. I'm going to Mike's place right now. I'll be back soon, Mom. Mom, thank you. "Mom"... This isn't funny. Who's there? Jill... I won't let her do that to me. Hurry! Hurry up, would you? You people wait here, got it? Good evening. Oh, what a lovely man. I'll let myself in. I'm a producer from PVC Record. Bob Adams. Oh, Jill's... Ah, I'm glad you're up. My, what a lovely little abode you have here. With a cute little birdie too. Chirp, chirp. Why you... Do you have business with me? It's about Jill. What about Jill? The thing is... She's saying that she doesn't want to be a singer. Huh? That she wants to stay in this town, because you're here. It's a problem for me if she says that now. I've spent a fair amount on her, you know. And now she does this. Honestly. And? What do you want me to do? Oh, you see... I'd like you to think about Jill's future. I was hoping you could leave town. Of course, I won't ask you to do it for free. I'll give you three hundred, no, five hundred. Five hundred. Stop this. How about a thousand, then? A thousand. You'll do it for a thousand, right? I don't need any money. You don't need it? Tomorrow morning, I'll leave town. You'll leave for free? Oh, goodness. You will? I see. Now that you know, you shouldn't need anything else from me. Yes, yes. I'm sure Jill will become famous and I'll make her happy. Bye. When her record comes out, I'll send you a copy. Her autograph too. Fabulous. Oh? Oh? Bob? You're wasting your time. He says he'll leave town on his own. Huh? Now, let's go. Let go of me! What are you doing, Mike? I'll leave town tomorrow. Why? Because if I stay here, I'll probably ruin your dream. Mike. Please, listen. For me, right now. For us, right now. I've realized what's most important. Madam O'Hara. No. My mother helped me realize it. Huh? Then... your mother, who supposedly went to Central City, was... That was her? Mike, my dream is to keep on singing. Not to become famous. And also... to be with you. Mike, I love you. Jill. I can't have you getting into that sort of mood. That's as far as this goes. C'mere! No! Stop! You're bothering Jill. How about you people give up? I can't do that. If this little lady runs off on me, it'll all have been for nothing! Hand her over quietly. Well? What do you say? You guys get lost! Oh? Stop! What are you doing? Stop! You should meekly hand Jill over to us. If you don't, this is what might happen. Stop! Stop that! Chico! Chico! Damn you! Get him! Now, come with me. Mike! You're coming. Stop! Mike! You can't! Stop! Does it hurt? It hurts, huh? Here. Stop, Mike! Mike, you have a visitor. Mike. Mike. Director. I'm sorry. Are you feeling well, Mike? Is there anything you want? I'll leave a book of Randall James poetry with the jailer for you. Seeking an end to his travels, the traveler sets out traveling once more. Maybe it's time you ended your travels. Cheer up. Listen, Mike. We will now begin the trial of Mike Davis for assault causing bodily injury. Defendant Mike Davis, stand up. Jill. Mom. Aren't you going inside? I can't. I... don't trust myself to be able to watch. You went to visit him, right? Yes. But, Mike... wouldn't see me. I see. It's a letter from Mike. Can I read it? "My dear Jill. I'm sorry it came to this. My heart was closed toward everything, and I could do nothing to thank you for opening it. Jill, I was taking life for granted. I lost to the monster called war. So, Jill... I have no right to be at your side. Love. That is the wonderful gift that you restored to my heart. And so... I will hold your songs inside me for the rest of my life... as I head for Mount Jeffry or Sunset Beach. Jill, may you always be happy. Please, forgive me for not being able to share that happiness with you. Farewell, my dear Jill. Mike." Jill. Mom. Jill. The verdict. We find the defendant guilty. However, after reviewing the facts of the case, and considering the extenuating circumstances, we issue a three-year suspended sentence. Goodbye, Chico. You're leaving, after all. Jack. Mike. Don't worry about tomorrow. Don't forget that tomorrow is always warm, a day on which the south wind will blow. Yeah. And that warm south wind is always blowing here in Lake City. If the north wind grows too harsh for me, I'll come back. Make sure you do, before you make your illness worse. I understand, Doctor. Being a sentimental doctor really doesn't suit me.
