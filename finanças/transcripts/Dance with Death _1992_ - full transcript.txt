Matt to my friends. - Kelly Crosby. I'll take you up on that drink now. So how did he kill her, same method? - He, now, if I said that, you'd accuse me of being sexist. - Yeah, and then I'd wait for you to answer the question. - Same method.

I try not to catch any eyes when I'm up there. - You caught mine. - You just happened to be where I was looking. - Lucky me. - This guy I'm talking about, sneaking around backstage last night. He was also out back later shopping with one of out local mobile entrepreneurs. - Shopping for what? - He bought a knife, at least I think he did. - So, Kelly, you don't know anything about the customers. So what about the girls? - You know the girl I was with last night? - Oh, Ms. Manners? - Yeah, she was lovers with the last girl who was killed and very possessive. So I was thinking that maybe she wanted to kill her girlfriend and the other girls were just-- - Camouflage. - Exactly. - It's promising. Anyone else? - Well, there's the DJ, Dermot.

You're so in to this undercover thing, you don't want it to end. - Oh no no, you're trying to end it all to soon. It is like you're doing all this just to get me to quit. - Maybe I am. - Why would you do that? - Kelly, you figure it out.

Without you, I only got two girls. - What two girls, where's Jodie? - Well, she's a no-show. - What? - Oh, no, don't worry about it. She pulls this every now and then, but you. I mean, you promised me you wouldn't let me down. You walk out on me, you lied to me. - Shit. - This stereo is 400 bucks, but for you guys, 75. - I don't think so, come on let's go. - Wait just a second, what else, what else you got, man? - Hold on a sec, wait.

I think I know who the killer is. - Not Jodie again? - I forgot all about her. She never showed up last night. - If there's one girl who can take care of herself, it's that one. Kelly, promise me something. No more stripping, no more hangin' out with strippers. - No wonder those girls are so screwed up there. They're strippers and it makes them whores.

Maybe he got lucky. - God, I hope not. - Hey, Henry, checkin' out the locomotion? You remember me, don't you? We met the other night at Jodie's. I don't believe you met my badge. - I know why you're looking for me. - Oh yeah, I'd imagine you do. Get down on the ground. - You ain't taking me in. - Hey, you scrawny mother fuck.
