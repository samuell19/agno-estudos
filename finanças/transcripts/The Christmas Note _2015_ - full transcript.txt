This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Trust me. You're gonna love Wilsonville. Can I take ski lessons? Hey, look at that tree. Yeah, they're setting up for the wonderland celebration on Christmas Eve. What do you think? It's awesome here. Good. And they have horses. Here we are. Our new home. Ah, you're gonna need the key. Go scope it out and then help me unload, ok? Ah! Fresh gingerbread cookies, Vivian, just like you ordered. Oh, today's the day, Betty. Won't it be so special having your family together again? Understatement of the year. Thanks for the treats. Merry Christmas. Oh, same to you, babe. Sorry I'm late! I brought cookie reinforcements. You're a lifesaver, mom. Oh honey, it's so good having you home. This is so hard to do alone. How am I even going to afford this house. Honey, you're not alone. That's why you moved five blocks away from me, remember? So we could be close. And you have Ethan. Speaking of... Oh, he's inside. Ethan, come say hi to your grandma! Grandma! Hi! Oh, that is how you greet your grandma. And how do you greet your grandson? With cookies, of course. Maybe you could help us first? I was helping. I was visualizing where things go inside. Mom says since I'm the man of the house now I can help organize our new place. I bet you've already organized where the TV should go, and the new Xbox you want for Christmas? Tell you what. These boxes are really light. Let's see how many you can carry to the house at the same time. You are so good with him. Well, when a chore sounds fun it's not really a chore. I learned that from you. Ethan? I guess meeting the new neighbors is more fun than carrying boxes. Hi, I'm Ethan. What's your name? Melissa. I just moved in next door. Welcome to the neighborhood. Why don't you have any lights up? It's only three weeks 'till Christmas. Lights aren't really my thing. I love Christmas just like my dad. He said he wished Christmas was every day. Then people would always be nice to each other. That's a nice thought. Though it might be a little unrealistic. I'm gonna go. Yeah. Wanna see dad's medals? There's a ton. He was on his second tour of duty and there was an explosion- Ethan! Sorry, you look like you're in a hurry. Come on, bud. Was it something I said? No, not at all, kiddo. She probably just has stuff like us. Oh, how does time move so fast? If you figure out a way to make it slow down, please tell me. What a sweetheart. Where are the Christmas stockings? I put all the decorations in the hall closet. I looked there. Maybe you missed a box? How's he holding up? We agreed if I'm sad he'll cheer me up and if he's sad I'll cheer him up. We're a team. Oh. That goes in the kitchen. What if I don't find a job? Have faith. I've already talked to several people in town. You'll find work. I wish I had your optimism. You do, it's just been knocked around a bit lately. We're gonna change that. "Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse." Dad and I used to change parts of the story to make it better. I'm sorry, buddy. I'm tired. Let's just stick to what's on the page, ok? Yeah, that's ok. I just missed how dad used to do it. "'Twas the night before Christmas "and all through the house, not a creature was stirring- Except for a velociraptor! Then what happens? The velociraptor hangs his stockings with care. The house shakes and the chimney breaks, which tells us... That the T-rex soon would be there! No! Goodnight, mom. Goodnight, buddy. Mom? Mom? Are you ok? I am. It's hard moving into a new house without your dad. I have an idea. Close your eyes. Now picture him. Can you feel him with us? He wants us to be brave. What if I don't like my new school? Hmm. I've been playing the "what if" game tonight, too. It's easy to be negative when you're tired, so... let's buy some new decorations tomorrow. That'll be fun. And think about what you want to ask Santa for. We need to mail your letter soon. I might not write one. Why not? I just don't know if I want to. Do you want to talk about it? Ok. Come on. And it took us only 10 hours to get here. Well, put me on the grill and call me well-done. Just look at you. It's good to see you, Betty. You should have seen your mom's eyes light up when she told me you were moving back to town. Like a Christmas tree. Welcome home, darling. Thank you. Now, I made a list of people that you can talk to about potential jobs- Uh oh, we've got a live one. Come on. Good morning, Betty. You know, if you ever stop selling these muffins I'm taking you to court. Robert, I'd like you to meet Gretchen Daniels, she's moved back to town and she's looking for work. Now, before you say you're completely staffed up- I'm- I'm completely staffed up. Just know she'd make a stellar addition to any office. Just in case you find an opening. Ok. You know, Robert if I have to stop making my Betty's everything muffins. I will keep that in mind. Nice to meet you, Gretchen. Nice to meet you. Betty. You could ask Santa for a new glove. My letter is a work in progress. I know what I want to ask him for, I'm just not sure if he can do it. Well, have faith. You don't know until you ask. You want to talk it through? Hey, look. It's Melissa. She works here. She looks busy. Let's not bother her. Come on. Oh, thank you. After you, ma'am. The store looks great, Melissa. This took big effort. Thank you. Of course. Santa's mail bag is getting pretty full. Sorry I'm late, Miss McCreary. It's your first week, Josh. This isn't a big deal, be on time tomorrow. Now help me with the window display. Uh, jacket in the back room, please. Yes. We ran into our new neighbor, She works at Wilson's. Really. I hope you introduced yourself this time. Not really. I can't tell if she's shy or just doesn't want to be bothered. Well, busy time of year, honey. Mom, she practically ignored us when we were standing on her front porch. Not everybody is easy to get to know, honey. Well, if Kyle was here he would reach out and be overly neighborly until we were all friends. Doesn't mean you can't do that. I suppose. Kyle just made everything feel easier. Who's that? Wanna get that, Ethan? Merry Christmas. Are your parents here? Can I help you? I'm looking for Melissa. Oh, she lives next door. I know. She's not home. I'm her mom's landlord. Ramona left Melissa as her emergency contact. Is Melissa ok? Her mother died. She has to clear Ramona's things. Could you let her know? 2382 Azure Avenue, 2B. Here's the key. I need it cleared out by the end of the week. Wait, can you just come back and tell her? I barely know her. And I've got a palmer waiting for me. I've got several buildings, you know? Thanks for passing on the news. King me! What? It's Melissa, she's home. Are you going over there? I could come with ya. I don't know. I don't know what to do, I don't even know her. Somebody has to tell her. She's gonna need a friendly face right now, honey, and you've got a friendly face. You're right. I should do it. Hi. I'm Gretchen from next door. We didn't really meet before. Ethan's mom. I'm Melissa. I'm sorry to have to tell you this... What is it? Your mom's landlord stopped by earlier and he wanted me to tell you... What? Your mom passed away. How? Did he say? Did he say when? No. He just left a key. Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I'm so sorry, Melissa. I feel awful bringing this up. Um... he needs you to go to her place and clean out her things. Here, in Wilsonville? Do you have anyone that you could call to help you? I'd offer, but it might be something you want your family- No, no. There's no one. Ok, well I'm just next door if you need anything. Thanks. If you'll excuse me. Of course. Was Melissa sad when you told her? Of course she was, honey. I told you, it's a sad thing to find out. No one expects to get that news. Hey, Melissa. Hi. I'm looking for your mom. Melissa. How are you doing? Do you want to come in? No, I'm going to my mother's place... and I wanted to take you up on your offer. I could use your help. Oh, ok. Good. When do you want to go? Now. Please. I just need to get through it. I don't want to do this. I don't think I can do this. I know how hard it is to miss someone you love. I know how alone it can feel. Let me go in there with you. You don't have to be alone. What do you say? You can do this. Come on, let's go. Are you ok? You were a cute kid. I can't believe she kept all these. We moved a lot for her work so she was always getting rid of things. Well, you never get rid of photos of your kids. I have boxes of Ethan's baby pictures. My mom wasn't really like that. She wasn't sentimental. How long had she been ill? I don't know. We hadn't spoken in ten years. I didn't even know she had moved back into town. We were never in one spot for long. Never long enough to put down roots or make friends. I know what that's like, I've had to move a lot recently. It's easier when you're an adult. When you're a kid it feels like your whole world is ending. Melissa, you should see this. "My dearest Melissa. "I don't know why I waited so long to tell you this. "Please forgive me. "Now that I'm sick I need you to know "why I made the choices I did. "This isn't easy for me to admit. "Before you were born I had a child "who I gave up for adoption." Come on, Ethan. We're going to be late. Gretchen. Hi. I wanted to say thank you for yesterday. Anyone would have done it, it's what neighbors do. I'm not sure that's true. I can't stop thinking about that note. About all of it. What it means. If you need an ear to bend... Thanks. I just found out the burial is this afternoon so I need to get through that first. I still need to clean out the apartment, too. I'm sorry about your mom, Melissa. Thank you. You were really sweet to her. Everyone needs a friend. Don't worry, kiddo. First weeks are always the hardest. Are you going to the cemetery? I don't think Melissa wants me there. I think she's used to doing things by herself. Doesn't mean she wants to. Dad told me he went to lots of funerals of soldiers he didn't know. I asked how come, he said out of respect. You must be Ethan's mom. Mom, this is my teacher. Be cool. I'm Megan Andrews. I'm Gretchen Daniels. I went here and loved it. Nice to meet you. I can already tell Ethan's a smart fellow. Don't set the bar too high. I'm a teacher, too. I haven't been able to find work yet, so if you ever need help with class I'm happy to volunteer. I am gonna hold you to that. Thanks. See you in class. Don't forget to mail my letter. I won't, cross my heart. Have a good day. Betty has been sending baked good every hour since she introduced us. I need the sugar to stop. Betty is persuasive. Well, she said the same thing about you. So? Well, I'm a teacher, grade school, which means I know a little about a lot but I learn fast. When I got here there receptionist was copying files, she didn't greet me for ten minutes and three calls went unanswered. The truth is you'd save money and be more efficient with me. And it won't be long term because as soon as a teaching job opens I'm taking it. So the way I see it is, even though you aren't hiring, you need someone. Me. I can hire you as a research assistant, part time only. I'll take it. Ok. Welcome to the team. Thank you. Hi. I'll have a medium dark roast coffee, please. Coming right up. I'm Betty, by-the-by. You're Melissa, right? Yes. I'm sorry, have we met? We were just talking about you. Hi, I'm Vivian. You live next door to my daughter, Gretchen. Honey, I am so sorry to hear about your mom. Thanks. No, no, no. It's on the house. Thank you. That's very kind. We heard about your sibling. You really were talking about me. Sorry, it's a small town. And we just can't get over what a miracle it is, you having a brother or sister you never even knew about. It doesn't even sound real yet. The fact that my mom gave up a child for adoption. That's a powerful kind of love. Right, Vivian? Oh, yeah. The most powerful kind. Vivian and her sister, Maggie, they were both adopted. They're children of the heart. Yeah, that's right. And I've got one of my own. Melissa, this is so exciting. Let us help you with your search. There's so many perks of being a sibling. You've always got someone to talk to and laugh with. Well, nothing like that kind of bond. I hope these two aren't giving you too hard a time. Not at all. Hello. They're good company. How was your mom's service? It's not a service, it's just a memorial. And I'm actually on my way there now. Do you want some company? It's ok, you don't have to- I know I don't have to, but no one should bury their mom alone. I can't believe someone left flowers for her. I feel sad for her. That that's it. We used to fight all the time. She used to say we were a team and we had to stick together, but that wasn't really true. I never got to stick anywhere. Or with anyone. Whatever mom wanted us to do, that's what we did. Moms don't always know the best way to be moms, but there's nothing like having someone who will never let go. When I was 18 she got a new job. Told me we were moving again. I told her I didn't want to go. We had one last fight. I said I never wanted to see her again, and that was it. She left. I ended up in Wilsonville because it was the only place we lived long enough to feel like home. And now, here it is, 10 years later and all I do is work. I'm just like her. How's that for irony? And here she just lived 10 minutes away that whole time. I can't believe she had another kid. I can't imagine her trusting someone else to raise her child. Maybe it wasn't about trust. Maybe she just couldn't do it herself. People have to give up children for adoption for a lot of reasons. Then why didn't she ever try to tell me? It took her a while but she did tell you. She still gave you that gift. A chance to find family again. How could I go 10 years without talking to her? When do you start your new job? Tomorrow morning. I knew Robert would come through. Now, we've taken care of that, but what about Melissa, ladies? She seemed a little nervous about all the unknowns. I had the opportunity once to meet relatives I never knew. Oh, you can imagine the thrill. No, it makes sense she's scared. She's never had this, this kind of closeness, a sense of family. Then her mom leaves that note with that bombshell? I'd be scared, too. Merry Christmas! Grandpa! Ha, ha, ha!!!! Surprise, buddy! Oooh, that's a big hug. How are you doing? Dad.. How's my favourite daughter? Thanks for coming, dad. It's gonna be alright, sweetheart. I miss him so much. I know you do. Mom never told me you were coming, grandpa. Yeah, that makes two of us. Ah, Vivian. Good to see you, too. Looking lovely as always. Thanks. Being single for ten years has done wonders for my complexion. Alright, well let's get you settled, dad. Ok. Right up here. Thank you. Oh Gretchen, this is lovely. I see you forgot to mention my ex-husband was coming for Christmas! Well, you're the one who said I should surround myself with family. I did, didn't I? Mmmhmm. Look on the bright side. What? You were in the same room for a minute and you managed not to kill each other. The night is young. Come on, let's go make nice. Don't tell my grandma, these are supposed to be for the Wish Bank fundraising thing but I thought if anyone could use a cookie right now it's you. Thanks. That's more than one. Well, then I also thought: who wants to eat cookies alone? I heard about the note from your mom. So what was the bombshell? Your mom didn't tell you? I couldn't hear it. Was it bad? It's not bad, it's just uh... surprising. Apparently I have a brother or sister somewhere out there. Really? Mmmhmm. That you've never met? Wow, that's heavy stuff. It is, actually. Very heavy. There you are. Ethan, you can't run off like that, we didn't know where you were. He brought me cookies. Well, you better not tell grandma, she'll ban you from licking the bowl. Scoot. Good luck finding your brother or sister, Melissa. Maybe they'll have some kids I can play with. Melissa, I've been thinking a lot about what you said at the memorial. I said a lot at the memorial. I over-shared. No, no, no. I'm glad you opened up, it just... it got me thinking. I know you're upset it took her so long to tell you, but think about how hard it was to write that note. I think you should do everything you can to find your new sibling. What if they don't want to be found? What if they do? What if they don't know you exist either? You could be giving both of you the most amazing gift. Family. If I was you I would do it. So what do you say? What exactly are we looking for? Clues. Some kind of lead. Look for cards, letters, anything that might have a name or an address on it. Hey, look at this. Who's that with your mom? I don't know. I've never seen him before. Why is the photo so blurry? That's what's weird. Why would you frame a blurry photo of someone unless he was important to her? Melissa, look at this. Oh, it's from my mom's cousin, Kay. "Dear Ramona, so lovely to catch up with you." And there's a PS with a cell phone number. I remember Kay was around when I was little. It was so long ago. Well, she lives right outside of town. I wonder if she even remembers me. Maybe your mom confided in her. She might know who that little boy in the picture is. Yeah. Call her. Hi, Kay. I'm not sure if you remember me, I'm Ramona's daughter Melissa. Melissa! Oh, I'm so glad you called! Oooh. Come, sit down. This is my friend Gretchen. Sit down. I hope we're not interrupting. Oh, not at all. These kids are scary talented. They're gonna be fine. I am so sorry to hear about your mom. She hadn't been sick very long. When you have a weak heart these things happen so quickly. It was so sweet that she came back to Wilsonville to stay close to you. What do you mean? Oh, well that's what she told me. She just wanted to keep an eye on you. She was so proud of the woman that you had become. She said you are such a hard worker, too. Manager at Wilson's now, right? The last time I talked to your mom she said how much she loved who you had become. How smart and independent you are. She really did want to reconnect with you very badly but she knew that you needed your space. Did Ramona ever mention anything about having another child? When? Before Melissa was born. This is the first I've heard of it. She left me a note. Is there anything, anything at all you might remember that might help us find Melissa's sibling? I remember she had a waitressing job in town here in her early 20's. I can't remember where. Maybe someone there knew something. Um... do you know who this boy is? No. Do you think he could be your brother? Well, boy. You didn't even know how to turn the oven on when we were married and now you're cooking? Grandpa's really good at pasta dishes but beyond that it's dicey. I always knew how to turn on the oven when we were together, Viv. Why would I want to cook when I had the best chef ever as my wife? Oh, flattery will get you nowhere. It got me you. Yeah, got. Past tense. Well, you know, things change. Look at me, I just took a couple classes. Yeah, cooking classes. You are full of surprises. Surprises make life interesting, don't they? Hey, let's get a tree tomorrow. Yeah! But you know what? I will say this. It is really, really nice to have all of us together again. Isn't it, Gretchen? Definitely, mom. Bon apetit. Mmm. Another kick? No, just feeling my size tonight. You are the perfect size. Doesn't it scare you how much our lives are about to change? No. Because I want this. And I'm excited about the change because it's with you. How do you stay so positive? Because I have you. And soon we will have him. Or her. Well, either way it will be amazing. I'm gonna pack up some leftovers and bring them over to Melissa's. Oh, nice. Seems like you've made a friend. She's hard to get to know but I like her. We'll see. I feel like she's hiding something. Really? Oh, by the way I um... I uh, asked your father if he would uh, help with the baking for the Wish Bank. Hmm. Seems like you've made a friend. Oh, stop it. Shh! Stop it. I'm still your mother. There has to be something here for us to go on. What if I find him? I need to be ready for the possibility that he might want nothing to do with me. Don't give up. I'm not giving up, I'm just preparing for all possibilities. Good or bad. Was your mom a sports fan? Not that I remembered. Why'd she have this? Maybe it belonged to the boy in that picture. This might be something. When I was little we lived across the street from her. Mrs. Schwagger. I stayed with her a lot when my mom worked late. They were friends. Do you remember her first name? No. Ok, let's see. Here's an article about a petition for a stop sign at Clarke and Verdugo. They quote a woman named Essie Schwagger. That's her. Essie Schwagger. I'm not seeing a way to contact her but now we have a full name. Essie Schwagger, that's a start. She might be able to explain the pennant. Or the boy in the photo. Or she might know which restaurant my mom worked at. We just need to find out where Mrs. Schwagger is. It's nice to see you, Essie. My grandson is gonna love these. Gingerbread are his favourite. Here's your change. It's Christmas. Buy someone some cookies on me. Oh, thanks. I take three sugars in mine, too. I always tell people I know that sounds like a lot. It tastes too much like coffee without the sugar. Exactly. It's all about the caffeine and the sugar rush. How's the search going? We have some clues. Now we just need some luck. Oh, well don't give up hope. Here, have some gingerbread cookies. You read my mind. No, no, no, it's taken care of. My last customer paid it forward. Wow, that's so nice. Well, in that case we'll take two coffees. Coming right up. It's Ethan! It's open, come on in. Hi. Let me help you. Wow. What is all this? Emotional reinforcements. You're gonna have to be a little more specific, kiddo. Well, you're going through hard times, losing your mom and not knowing who your brother or sister is. Decorations will cheer you up. First cookies, now decorations. You think of everything. The best decorations have stories behind them. My grandma gave me this. I want you to have it. It's beautiful. Can I give you a piece on of advice? Sure. One time I heard my grandma say our outsides reflect our insides. If you make your house look happy, then after a while you'll be happy, too. Are you saying my house looks sad? Is it? I guess this house doesn't have much of a life because this house is a workaholic. You were talking about the house as a metaphor, right? I don't know what a metaphor is, but it sounds like you need. We can do Christmas lights. I'll bring some over next time. But let's put these up. Alright. Hey, is this the picture I heard you and mom talking about? That's the one. I hope he's your brother. He looks like someone you'd get along with. Hello! Hi. Hi. Ah, for me? You shouldn't have. I didn't. Ah, very well. They're for the house. I was at Fern's and I realized I hadn't gotten Gretchen a housewarming gift yet. Oh. That's it. You're amazing! Thank you. I... If I knew she loved flowers that much I would have brought them every day. Ethan, honey it's time for homework. And we have a call to make. I'll be right there. Bye, Melissa. See you, kiddo. Do these remind you of anything? The flowers at the chapel. They had the same silver ribbon. Exactly. They're from Fern's Flowers. Fern Dunlop is a friend of my mom's, they play bunko together, and the silver ribbon is her signature. Do you think my sibling left those flowers on my mom's casket? Maybe. Ramona just moved back here so if Kay didn't leave the flowers, who did? It could even be Essie. Alright, I will check and see if I even have a record of it. Huh, that's strange. Is it Essie Schwagger? No. Normally I wouldn't divulge this information but I know this woman. She's one of my regulars. A real family person and I think she would want to know if she had a sister. Her name is Kelly Robinson. She lives at 2382 Azure Avenue. Apartment 2A. Thank you. There you go. That's my mom's address. Are you ready for this? You're afraid, but this could be the start of something amazing. Ok, I'm ready. Ok. Hi. Hi. Are you Kelly Robinson? I am. And you're Melissa. I recognize you from photos. You knew my mother. I did. We'd have tea together every evening. Kind of an end of the day catch up. I always looked forward to it. Would you like to come in? Yeah. Welcome. How long have you known Ramona? I met her the day she moved in. Six months ago? She reminded me of my mom. We had this instant bond. This might sound like a random question, but how old are you? I am turning 38 next week. Why? I thought you might be someone we're looking for. I was wrong. But you and Ramona, you were close? She said she always regretted letting you two grow apart. I didn't even know she had moved back to town. She didn't contact me. She wanted to. She just thought it would upset you. She told you that? Yeah. She said she put pressure on you and she didn't know how to undo it. She wanted to apologize. I didn't make that easy for her. And I think I was the one who needed to apologize. Have you ever seen this photo? It was on her wall. You know who that boy is? Not really, no? I think Ramona mentioned he was an old friend. Boy, Santa's got a lot of reading to do. Thanks for coming in early. I really need to get these letters to the post office today. I actually like coming in before the crowds. The store is peaceful. Well I appreciate it. I'll be back here before it gets too busy. Ok. Can I bring you guys some hot chocolate since you're working so hard out here in the cold? No, no, wait! Melissa, don't look! I'd love some hot chocolate, thank you. No, grandpa! She can't know what we're doing until we're done. No peeking, I promise. What are you thinking, grandpa? Hmm. Tell me what this needs. Mmm. More red pepper. Ok. I let myself in. Something smells really good. Oh, well thank you, you better try it, ok? Tell me if I made it too spicy, or... It's got a kick. I like it. I think it could even use a little more- Red pepper, right? I mean, as far as I'm concerned- The spicier the better. Absolutely. Ok, you can stay for dinner. You passed the spice test. Oh, is that Kyle? Yes, he's never late for one of our calls. Hello? It's so good to hear your voice. You heard my voice last night. That doesn't make it any less good to hear. You sound so much stronger every time we talk. You do. How are you feeling today? Better. I'm actually calling with good news. I did a whole lap around the fourth floor without my walker. I feel like a new man. Does that mean you're coming home? Please say you're coming home. I'm coming home. The General signed my release papers. I'm gonna catch the first flight I can to get out of here. Is there anything I need to do to get the house ready? I'm gonna do some physical therapy outpatient, but I'll figure that out when I get home. I just can't wait to see you and Ethan. I love you so much. I love you, too, baby. Oh, he's coming home for Christmas! Yes, can you believe this? That's just wonderful news! I'm so happy. I thought he... when you were moving in and Ethan said there was an explosion, I thought... I didn't know he was still alive. There was a land mine. The truck in front of Kyle's got hit. Kyle's truck rolled, his legs got pinned but he was very lucky. He really sounds like he's making progress. That's so great. Where is he? At a military hospital in Germany. He told me to come home with my family while he was recovering. I'm so sorry. I... I thought he was... Melissa. Where are you going? You should be with family and friends right now. I am. How am I a friend when I had no idea Kyle was alive? He's your husband I never even asked about him. I never asked how you were. All I cared about was what I was going through. Well, you've been going through a lot so you can cut yourself some slack. And to tell you the truth, after what we've been through you're part of my family whether you like it or not. I should have asked. Melissa, look! Ta-dah! Look, we all make mistakes. I'm not going anywhere. Dinner is about ready. Come back inside and you can ask me anything you want. You coming? Ethan, you rock! I may have to put you to work on the windows at Wilson's. Come on, buddy. Wait up, wait up! If I ever find my brother I hope he's just like you. When you find him, ask him where he got that awesome Wilson's Warriors hat he's wearing in that photo. I didn't know that was a Wilson's Warriors hat. But it makes sense. They've updated their mascot logo by now. That explains the pennant we found in Ramona's things. It was a Warriors pennant. What if your brother played on the team? Maybe Ramona went to watch him play. We should talk to Jason Wilson. He runs the store. Ok. Come. Alright, I found it. Ok. Could you walk us through the rest of the team. and do you know if any of them were adopted? We think one of them might be Melissa's brother. Well, we were a pretty tight-knit team, I knew all their families. The only one I didn't know was him. I don't remember his name. Do you think he looks like me? Actually, he does. You've got the same cheek bones. Here. Is this the same boy? Um, maybe. I don't know, I'm not sure. Look, why don't you just hang on to this. You might need it. Thank you. What do you think? I don't know. It's so blurry. So, tell me why cooking class? Well, you know, after we split up I was good for a while but then I just needed things to fill the void. Here, try the fruits of my labour. Careful, they're hot. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yes. Huh? That's a cookie, alright. You know what? Getting a compliment out of you is like wrestling a bear but I will take it. Thank you. You're welcome, Phil. I gotta pick up Ethan. Ladies, we'll finish this later. Vivian, those are horrible. I know! He's just trying to get my attention. You like him. No! Oh, Vivian Lloyd, you have the hots for your ex-husband. Oh, stop it! I'm trying to be nice. I love it. Oh, it's romantic. Why shouldn't you two reconnect? Uh, let's see. We were terrible together. That was years ago. Take a chance. Oh. Hey. How is the search going? Well, we might have two pictures of him now. It's inconclusive. It's definitely the same boy in both photos and I think he looks a lot like Melissa. Ramona could be his mom, too. Wait, your mother's name was Ramona? Yeah. Ramona McCreary. Oh, you're kidding! Hold it! I have no idea what she... here she comes. Betty's hall of fame. Uh, yes. There. That's your mother, right? She was here. It wasn't for long. I'd have to check my records. And this is her friend, Lori Ackerman. Did you know her? No. They were roommates, inseperable. You put the two of them together and they'd talk your ear off. She could be the person we're looking for to put the puzzle pieces together. Do you know if she's still in town? You bet your bonbons I do. I even know where she works. Your mother was like a sister to me. We did everything together. She made me laugh so hard. So you met at Betty's bakery? That's right. I was still living at home if I wanted to get a place. Being Ramona's roommate felt like summer camp every night. So you were living together when she was pregnant? That's right. Almost the whole time. What do you mean almost? The last month of her pregnancy she left. Do you know where she went? No. She was so young and she knew she wasn't ready. When she came back, she came back without the baby. That baby did change Ramona.. She was determined if she had another kid it would be different. She'd get a steady job and save her money so she could offer her kid a real future. Did she ever say anything about the adoptive parents? She didn't know them. How about the father? I didn't know him. But I know she didn't tell him. She wanted to give that kid a shot at a decent life. That's all she wanted for you, too. Everything was for you. Did you make these just for me? Mmmhmm. I'm honored. Thank you. Well, let's put them up, shall we? Yeah. Oh, boy. I bet you miss your dad, huh? Yeah. Do you miss your mom? Yeah, I do. My mom made a lot of sacrifices for me and I never realized it. I never really knew my mom. Not really. Promise me something? What is it? Promise me you'll always stay close to your mom. Even if you ever get really mad at her. I've been mad at her before. I mean really mad. Even if that happens, don't ever push her away. Ok. I promise. Good. Your mom was pretty. Wow, these popcorn strands are a nice touch. I like them. It's the home made stuff that makes decorations go from just fun to something special. I'll keep that in mind. Speaking of special, is there anything you really want for Christmas? Just one thing. I asked Santa for it but I still don't want to say it out loud because if you say a wish out loud you can jinx it. Ah. Well, I should go home before mom wonders where the popcorn is. Hello? Hey, it's Jason. Josh had a snowboarding accident. Oh no. Ow. Are you up for visitor? Miss McCreary? No way! I mean yes way. Visitor is totally welcome. You sound like you're in good spirits. Are you in pain? Oh, it's just a few broken bones but I'll survive. My snowboard, on the other hand, is a lost cause. Do you have work stuff that you need to tell me? I just wanted to see how you were doing. So don't worry about work right now. And if you need anything, call me. Thanks, Miss McCreary. Josh, you can call me Melissa. Melissa. Thank you, Melissa. Hi, grandma. Melissey? Is that you? Mrs. Schwagger? You know my grandma? Mrs. Schwagger, I've been looking everywhere for you. Sometimes the best way to find something is just to stop looking. I've been looking for you because I need your help. Can you talk? You were always so special to me. How do you even- I mean, I was so young when you knew me. Age doesn't mean a thing. I would look after you when your mom worked late and we'd talk. Mostly about how mad you were at her. I remember. And you'd be asleep when your mom got home wanting a play-by-play. And so I would tell her all the things on your mind. Did she ever mention having another child? No. Well, she did. And I think he might be in this photo. Do you know any of these kids? I'm sorry, my eyes aren't quite what they used to be. What about him? Would you look at that? You know him? Of course I do. He used to live across the street. He was always a good boy. Still is, in fact. So you're still in touch? Well, not as much as I'd like. But I can tell you where to find him. *** How cool would it be if my brother works for them now? Very cool. Hi. The woman at the front desk said we could come back here. Are you Bruce Adler? Yes. How can I help you? Well, this might sound crazy I think you might be my brother. And then we found this photo. Is that you? That's me. That's an incredible story. I wish I could say your journey ends here, but I'm not your brother. I was born in Canada. We moved to Wilsonville when I was eight. So why are you in that picture with my mom? I met her when I was 10. It was after our last game that season. We won. I ride my biclycle to my pizza party when I hit a pot hole and ate it. Twisted my ankle. Your mom pulled over, made sure I was ok, and drove me to the hospital and waited 'till my dad got there. She kept me distracted by asking me about the team. I didn't know how to thank her, so I gave her my pennant. We took this picture when she came to one of my games. She kept your pennant. Really? That's amazing. You had a really good mom. She was there for me when it mattered. Thanks. I wish I was the brother you're looking for. I do too. You seem like you'd be a pretty good one. Stop by sometime. Let me know how the story ends. We will. Thank you. Uh, there's someone who works with us here at the Wish Bank who can help. He's resourceful, he loves doing this kind of thing. We'd appreciate any kind of help. His name is Robert Layton. I'll get you his number. It's ok, we already have it. So we met Bruce Adler. Yes, he filled me in. And I must say, Melissa, your story really moved me. Which is why I wanna help. That's very generous, but I- I've seen countless lives changed by the simplest acts of kindness, so please let me do this for you. Besides, Bruce asked me to help and I can't say no to Bruce. Ok. Ok. Thank you so much. You're very welcome. Uh, ok. Well, the first thing I'll need is Ramona's social security and driver's license numbers. I think I have both at home. Great. The quicker you can get those to me, the quicker I can start looking for the adoption records. Is everything ok? Kyle just emailed me. They changed his physical therapy schedule which is why he couldn't call before. He's going to call in the morning. I know you've been worried. Well, spending the day with you helped me forget how worried I've been. I need to apologize for not being entirely honest with you. I haven't been truthful with myself for a long time. It was always easier to say that my mom was to blame for why we stopped talking but it wasn't her fault. It was mine. She didn't leave after I told her I didn't want to move again. I left. It was me. I put the distance between us. I told her I didn't want her to call. You were only eighteen, Melissa. I was old enough to know that it hurt her when I left. I wish I could take it back. I wish it so much. She knew you loved her. She knew it everyday. You told me that note was a gift from my mom to me. I never understood that before. But I do now. She let me forgive myself. I miss her, Gretchen. What do you mean? My release, it's been delayed until after the first of the year. They can't do that, can they? How can the tell you... I will get home to you and Ethan. I just need you to be strong for me. Be strong for Ethan. I'm ok, I just miss you. I love you so much. I love you, too. Smells good, huh? I don't know if I can fit all of them into- hey! Kyle isn't coming home. What do you mean? They delayed his release until after New Year's. I thought the General signed his release? It doesn't matter, the doctor has to sign off on it, too. How do I tell Ethan that his dad won't be home for Christmas? It'll crush him. Excuse me. It's going to be ok. I'm sorry. I just didn't want to cry in front of everyone. You can cry in front of me. I try to be so strong for Ethan but I just want my husband home safe. Is that too much to wish for? Oh, honey. He's on my mind all the time. He's all I think about. I know. I'm so worried he'll come back and be different. What do you mean? I'm afraid that this whole experience, getting hurt out there. I'm afraid that it scarred him. That he won't be the same. He's gonna be the same Kyle. The only way to know for sure is to see him. To look in his eyes and talk to him and hug him. Knowing I was going to get to do that soon has been keeping me together. I just don't know if I can wait any longer. You don't have to wait it out alone. We'll wait it out together, ok? Of course. I have to tell Ethan. Before bedtime stories, there's something we need to talk about. I got a call from your dad today. Is he ok? Yes, yes. He's doing great. But unfortunately he won't be able to come home in time for Christmas. What? You just said he was doing great. That means he should come home. That's not the way it works, honey. That's all I asked for in my letter to Santa. He has to come home. He has to. Honey, he'll be home soon, ok? I want him home now. I know. Melissa! Hey, Bruce. Did you find him? I'm not really any closer than the last time we spoke. But Robert Layton's been very helpful. Happy I could help. Someone told me that you were part of the military. Correct. What's going on? Read this. There's only five days left until Christmas. I haven't got much time. Hello? Melissa, hi. It's Robert Layton. Ramona's social security and driver's license didn't yield anything concrete. Is there anything else we can do? Well, this may be a situation where too much time has passed so it's hard to get the info we need. The records are old, they're hard to locate. Look, I'm working on it but it doesn't look good. I'll just- I'll let you know if I come up with anything new, alright? Please do. Thanks for your help. You got it. If this is the end of our search. I want to thank you for encouraging me. I'll admit it's been fun, even though you fought it at first. I'm stubborn. Really? But it would have been a mistake not to look. Because along the way I've met so many people who I never would have met otherwise. You included. Well, I feel the same. I suddenly have the urge to write "keep in touch" in your yearbook. Hey, honey. How was school today? I was kind of too distracted by my feelings of malaise to pay much attention to Mrs. Andrews. Where on earth did he learn the word "malaise"? He used it three times in the car on the way home. I looked it up on my phone. It means he's sad. Thanks, dad. I'll talk to him. OK. Sometimes it feels like you'll never get the thing you want, but I don't want you to give up because tomorrow is filled with possibilities, ok? Is that your way of telling me I'm not getting an Xbox One? You know what I'm talking about. We all miss dad. But missing him can feel a tiny bit less difficult when we do it together, you know? Hello? Melissa, hi. It's Robert. Um, listen. I found something. Can you and Gretchen meet me at 4:00? What's going on? No, he said he found something. I was waiting for you. Are you nervous? A little. But mostly excited. Come on. Ok. Ladies. Please, have a seat. Please tell us you have good news. I tracked down an unpaid medical bill at a collection agency which led me to the hospital that Ramona gave birth at. Bruce had a connection there so he made a call. We talked to a Doctor Gibbs and it turns out that both of our daughters go to Brown so he offered to do me a favour. You realize you're killing us with anticipation. I do, yes. Doctor Gibbs didn't think he would find anything, I mean after 32 years he felt that it would be difficult to locate a birth certificate. But... Well? Who is it? Were we closed? It's quite something, isn't it? I know it's your sibling and you have every right to keep it to yourself but I'm your friend and we've been on this journey together. We're not just friends. It's more than that. The adopted records? Birth mother Ramona McCreary, adoptive mother and father I'm confused. Those are my parents. Is this a typo? Ramona McCreary gave birth to you at 3:15 in the afternoon on April 4th at St. John's Hospital. She then handed you over to the adoption agency who had a private pre-arranged adoption with your parents. So I'm... you're... my sister? Are you ok with all this? I'm great, are you ok? I'm great, too. We're sisters! We're sisters! Well, I take it this is good news? The best ever! We need to tell your family! Ok! Robert, thank you. Thank you. Please, you don't have to thank me. Now go see your family. Ok. Oh my gosh. We have news! What is it? What happened? You tell them. Ok. You know how we always talked that one day trying to find the woman who was my birth mother, right? Yeah, of course. We encouraged you, yeah. Well, we don't have to look now. Her daughter found me. Wait, you- you mean Melissa? Melissa? Yeah. That's incredible! Come here, come here! Oh, give me a hug. Now you really are part of the family. Does that mean you're my aunt? Yes. How about a hug? Wow. Gretchen, honey, what's the matter? I just realized something. If Kyle hadn't been injured, I wouldn't have come home. Melissa and I wouldn't have found each other, and it's all happened because Ramona wrote you a note. A note about me. Ho ho. Cupcakes, get your cupcakes! I'll take two, please. Ethan loves your class. I want to talk to you about that. Is everything alright? More than allright actually. My husband and I are expecting. We got word this afternoon that we're having a baby girl. That's fantastic, congratulations. I'm taking mat leave in the spring, I spoke to the principal and if you're interested... I'll take it! It's just to finish the year, but once you're foot's in the door I'm sure you'll be able to get a permanent position with the school district. Thank you so much, you have no idea how happy you just made me. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You know it's a grievous mistake not to be selling my cookies. We didn't want any lawsuits. Oh, you are so jealous just because I made better cookies. Viv even said so. OK. You know what, stop with the cookies. Your cookies were awful! Ok? And I think you purposely made them that way to get my attention, didn't you? Oh, you are so right. They were disgusting. Come on, I can't bake. You're the one who does all the magic in the kitchen. Do you really think that? Yes, I do. Because you know what? What? I like you and I miss you. Do you like me and miss me, too? Yes, I do. Well then maybe we should start spending more time liking each other and less time missing each other. I would like that. So would I. Thanks, Mrs. Schwagger. And for the special donation. Gretchen is going to be so surprised. Happy to help, Bruce. How do you know everyone, grandma? It's a reward for a life well-lived. You'll see. Hey, Josh. Hey, Melissa. Mrs. Schwagger. I'm glad you guys got here early. Grab yourselves some cider and something to eat. The festivities start as soon as it's dark. Santa. Ho ho. She's so pretty, grandma. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the Wilsonville Wonderland Celebration! This year marks our 50th anniversary. Can you believe that? 50 years, people. Ok, without further ado it's time to light our Christmas tree, so who would like to come and do the honours? Me! Young man back there, come on up. Ethan, right? Yeah. Come on up, Ethan. Gretchen, why don't you come up as well? Here's the switch, buddy. Now Ethan, we are going to count you down and you flip the switch, ok? Are you ready, everyone? Five, four, three, two, one! Merry Christmas! Kyle! Dad! Hey, son. You made it for Christmas! I missed you. I missed you, too. I didn't hurt you, did I? You in my arms would never hurt. Now, Kyle wasn't set to come home for Christmas this year, but uh... sometimes the smallest voice can make the biggest sound and I have a friend who made some noise and helped bring Kyle home. So please join me in welcoming this brave man to Wilsonville. Alright, everyone. If you all could please light your Christmas candles. Dad, lean on me, ok? You got it, son. Welcome home, soldier. Thank you, sir. It's so good to have you back. Kyle, I want you to meet my sister. Did you say "sister"? I'll fill you in. All you need to know is I have a sister. It's so nice to meet you. You too. You're a sister who deserves a hug. How is it even possible you're here right now? Your guess is as good as mine. Someone called and convinced the doctor that I should recuperate at home. Family is my best medicine. It was Santa. He got my letter. I had faith and he delivered. Thank you. For Kyle. I don't know what you mean. Magical things happen at Christmas. And I have one more present for you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, sister. Come.
