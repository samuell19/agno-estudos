The striker spring will bump against the detonator inside ignition will occur, the grenade will explode in a delay of 3.2 to 4 seconds with a lethal range of 3 meters. Yes. If the hand grenade is held in hand with the safety pin removed then the grenade will not explode, correct? Correct. But I am curious. Why wouldn't you let it go? It's not a girl's hand. But in case you're so unfortunate to be holding a hand grenade without a safety pin. Remember you must hold on to it like a girl's hand. Don't let go so easily. Thank you. We, the Explosive Ordinance Disposal unit, work in teams of two during operations. This is Superintendent JS Cheung. He is Bomb Disposal Number One. As Number Two, my job is to assist Number One to complete the mission as safely and quickly as possible. If a hand grenade lands in front of me but it doesn't explode after 4 seconds what shall I do?

Officer Cheung. If those parents found out I got stinking drunk in a bar and was brought to a police station I don't know what they'll do I'm normally not like that. You don't have to tell me I really don't mind I've been separated for six months and just signed the divorce papers I went to the bar just to drown my sorrows. Then I wanted to see if I still "got it". You can just let me off up ahead. It's okay. Where are you going? I have time to give you a ride. No, thanks I don't want to... But I do. No I don't want to get involved with a taken man I'm not. You don't believe me? In tonight's mission, an undercover officer helped us raid an armed robbery organization. We arrested two suspects. We have issued a bounty of HK$5 million for the arrest of the other suspects I will wire $50 million in to your Cayman account. After I get the money in a month's time my team will have trickled into Hong Kong. And now, our EOD bomb disposal expert. Superintendent JS Cheung, please. Please say a few words, Officer Cheung. Many people ask why I joined EOD including my girlfriend I told her a story. It's called Long ago, a group of mice wanted a way to go out of their hole to find food without being eaten by the cat outside. Finally they had an idea: Hang a bell on the cat. Every time they hear the bell they would stay in the hole, and all will be well. But the question was which mouse should hang the bell? As they were discussing that, a little mouse raised his hand and said, "I'll go".
