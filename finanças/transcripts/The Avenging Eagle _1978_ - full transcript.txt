Drink slowly Your name? Your name? The Rover What an interesting name Yours? The Homeless We're the same Where are you off to? Anywhere there's a road It's a dead end There's only desert ahead I know, but where there's a will there's a way That's true If I were you and if I had a choice I wouldn't be in this God forsaken place By your looks you must have gone without food for a few days At least 3 to 4 days Wait, I'll get you something to eat Wait The water is poisoned, don't drink if you want to live I am returning the water and the food ...intact to you Have you come to arrest me? No By your looks... you don't look like a travelling business man Then...friend Have I crossed you in any way in the past? You are too much; repaying kindness with a grudge leaving me a damn horse Do you want to kill me? You are a rogue you should appreciate that if it weren't for me you'd have been a pile of bones by now Put out the fire Why? I can't stand the light You have to be patient then I'll tell you a story I was born in the night My family lit all the lamps to welcome me Since then I've always liked the light and I would cry at night if there was no light That sort of disturbed the whole family Put it out What great skills! You flatter me That's all I know If this goes on I'll make a fool of myself Friend, fate has brought us together ...in this barren land We don't have a rapport and there's nothing to talk about Ride your horse and get out of here You're too cold It's dark I can't even find the directions, how can I leave? That's your business Why bear such a grudge? Can you bear with me for a night and let me sleep with this small fire going? I'll leave the first thing in the morning, okay? Who's he? Why doesn't he give his name? Great, it must be the camel caravan Wait What's the matter? No Friend, if you don't want fresh blood to stain your clothes... it's not too late to leave even now Blood? Whose blood? Chik Ming Sing, come out and face your death There's also that accomplice Accomplice? If you're really Chik Ming Sing that accomplice should be me I am Chik Ming Sing So you're running from your enemies Don't worry, I'll attend to your corpse I promise I'll get the best coffin for you Tell me your address so I could send you back This technique is called the Bastard's Somersault Damn you Brother, let me live, okay? That means killing myself Is this how you handle the hammer? Not like this Bastard, why did you hit me there? That's our favourite spot Are you giving up? Not unless you come to apologise to godfather with me I can't do that Yau Kwoon Hung, we've been brothers for years Don't force me to kill you Bull shit. You can't kill me Godfather said regardless of if you're dead or alive as long as you return The second and third batch just follow closely It's useless if you get help You must be Wang Tao Sang the Soaring Eagle Your father Damn you Why do you like to hit this spot? This is the iron egg smashing into the soft egg It's completely changed Why did you kill him? He attacked first, it was self defence The issue is you're so alone that I should save you I got you this plaque What a busy body It's difficult to do the right thing You have a murderous look you must have killed many people I don't remember I do remember how many women I've had The 3 men you killed just now are... Two, one was killed by you Tell me frankly. For which case are you arresting me for? So you take me for one of those man hunters? Sorry, I'm not interested in such an immoral profession Then why are you following me? What do you want? Don't doubt my identity anymore I am a vagabond If you want me as friend, that's good ...if not, forget it It doesn't hurt in your case to make one more friend Alright...l'll take you as friend temporarily As you wish Your background is a mystery There's an end to conversation and there's a time for riddles to be solved, right? Yes, please Why does the Iron Boat gang want to kill you? You want to listen to this story too? I've nothing else better to do, if you talk I'll listen The Iron Boat gang is a criminal gang and does a lot of illegal activities The head is Yoh Xi Hung He is also the godfather of the Thirteen Eagles He is cruel, merciless and cold He brought up the Thirteen Eagles as killing machines Feelings' is not a word in his dictionary If one member shows slight affection for another they'll be beaten up How Yoh Xi Hung thinks and feels is how the Thirteen Eagles think and feel Absolute obedience is necessary I am an orphan and was sold to the gang at seven I did all the bad things imaginable and became numb to cruelty I can't remember how many children there were... at the start Over ten years, the coward, the disobedient those who didn't progress in kung fu, the kind hearted ...have all been killed Only 13 people are left Thirteen Eagles? Thirteen Eagles There are only 9 of them left now Yes...the story you made up is interesting If you really did all those bad things all your life only to end up being persecuted by Yoh Xi Hung don't you find it ironical? I feel you had no reason to rebel against Yoh Xi Hung I was tired of killing I don't believe you You said the Thirteen Eagles were trained to be killing machines just like extensions of his sword It's strange. Do killing weapons have thoughts which spur them to rebel? Weapons won't rebel but he forgot one point I am still a human being You appear like a man but more like a rogue You... Naturally you don't believe I became tired of killing I had a strong reason for rebelling against him One day Yoh Xi Hung assembled the Thirteen Eagles ...in the Jui Yi Hall for a conference We hurried there Children Yes Godfather, we wish you health and good fortune Good, I just received information that the 32 security bureaus in the central area will jointly guard a cargo of royal treasures which include the invaluable red sea ginseng In few days the treasure reaches deserted Yu Fai town Do you now understand why I have called this meeting? Yes Godfather, nothing is impossible in fulfilling your wish Right, heaven and earth can't stand in our way You're right Sooner or later we'll be great so we have to expand our territory There should not be any lack of money What I worry about is... the 32 security bureaus will bring along a lot of men And I've heard the leader is Golden Spear Tao De Biu Godfather, you should have confidence in us All of us have been to many battles Have we ever failed you? That's what I want to hear Good, lads, await my orders to set off Robbers, get up Robbers Quick... The Thirteen Eagles of Iron Boat gang What, the old thief Yoh Xi Hung has come too? It's below his lordship to fight dummies Leave him to me, you go and chase those robbers Chase them Yes Go Quick...let's go Go on, don't worry about me Go quickly Chik Don't worry about me Catch it... Chase them quickly Aunt, teach us how to write, okay? Okay What is this character? Sky Write one more time, aunt What is this character? Jiang, isn't that your name? Yes, so is yours Yes I write it for you to see That's right You can't come out, go and lie down I'll get my family Brother...he's awake He's up? That's good, let's go and see Mom Come here Mom I already said he's strong and will wake up Don't get up, lie down... Lie down first Yes, lie for a while, don't get up You've been unconscious for 3 days and nights I found you on my way home in the woods I am indebted to you for saving my life Don't mention it How were you wounded? I was ambushed by my enemy and was wounded Luckily I escaped quickly, otherwise... Your name please? Cheung Gia Ran And you? Jiang Shun Kwai Brother Jiang This is my mother Aunty My wife Madam My sister Siu Fung Miss Fung Brother feel free to make yourself at home Good... Recuperate well It's late, what are you thinking? I thought about it thoroughly I was too strong willed and succumbed to my temper My actions were tainted by some evil elements What I've seen these two months are kind, friendly faces I have been listening to ways to live in harmony As I grew up I had not enjoyed family life I will always cherish this Miss Fung, do you believe I have killed people? Yes, I do How come? If you didn't kill others... why would they come and kill you? Don't you find me frightening? No, I believe you'll never kill again Miss Fung, do you want to know what I was like? What matters is from now on you know how to lead a good life Lead a good life? Yes You must remember that how to lead a good life Godfather What's the matter? Your day of vengeance has come Yien Lin Yes You've found him? Yes Wan Da has already found where Wang An is hiding He's in the South Village near Tai Ran Wang An I thought I could not find you You had me captivated such that I suffered for 2 years now I have a chance to take revenge Godfather we will depart right now and bring Wang An to you We are going now Good, it doesn't matter if he's dead or alive Godfather... Chik Ming Sing is back Chik... Chik Godfather Chik Godfather I'm back It's good you've returned I can relax now Yien Lin couldn't find you so I thought you have been caught by the authorities How could that be? You taught me I should not endanger my colleagues I'd rather be killed than be taken alive Chik, I swore as long as you haven't come back I'll not touch the loot lt'll always be in the vault Thank you for your kind love Lost it? No Then why haven't you brought it back with you? Godfather I said... these 13 silver plaques have been made by my own hands It symbolizes your life and the whole Iron Boat gang Godfather It represents me too yet you could forget I dare not Dare not? You have deliberately disobeyed me Godfather, you... Godfather, I know I'm wrong Godfather Forget it Chik Yes Let me ask you Of the four Jiang Nan man hunters I often talk about how many have been killed? Three Who's left? Devil's Plight Wang An This time you'll really see the devil Wang An's kung fu is not bad Failure is not an option Kill him and let godfather be happy Big brother, when this is finished I want to see a friend Can I return a few days later? A woman? Chik has fallen in love with a woman Big brother, Wang An is hiding in this valley We must have got it wrong There is only a family in this valley and there are no other roads What are we doing there? We're not wrong at all I passed here last month and saw Wang An come out of this house I was alone so I stayed away from him Big brother, stop You must be wrong You are wrong Wang An, come out Come here, quick Follow mother inside Wait Please don't kill the wrong person He isn't Wang An, he saved my life His name is Jiang Shun Kwai What would you know? You haven't seen him I've seen him, he's Wang An That's right Would you really assist him and kill my brother? So she is the woman you have fallen in love with Not bad Chik Ming Sing, tell her the purpose of your trip here Big brother, you're pushing him How can he say it... in front of his lover? Let's finish the job Stop fighting Big brother, listen to me What are you doing? Listen to me Chik Mother... Dear Brother Jiang Get lost Brother Chik, you're nuts Big brother, why must we kill everyone? I beg you, let her go Big brother Godfather said we should leave no one alive You heard that yourself, dare you disobey? Miss Fung Didn't you chop off Wang An's head? I couldn't bear to do it You dare talk of feelings I taught you this? Did I teach you to feel? Godfather, listen Don't forget a minor punishment is 72 flogs, a major one is 36 You didn't only see me punish people once so it is obvious you deliberately rebel against me I dare not, forgive me I can do that but you must knock them down one by one otherwise you'll be punished Godfather Attack Brothers, you... Wait Yes I was wrong You admit you're wrong? I don't think you mean it I am truly wrong Let no more be said, torture him I see Since then you became tired of killing right? Yes From the start of this incident to the end of the other matter I made up my mind to leave Yoh Xi Hung I don't think so The reason why you don't kill is you have fallen in love with Miss Siu Fung Were it somebody else who is not emotionally involved with you ...it might not have changed your ways Right, further up is the desert Why don't you turn back? There's no hurry Your pursuers will soon catch up with you Look Looks like he's been dead for a few days Damn, it must be the work of Chik Ming Sing Chase Friend, listen to my advice and turn back You cannot run forever See? They are hot on our heels As I suggested shall we divert their strength? Would that not make me owe you more? Let's go Chik Ming Sing, you're cruel You won't show mercy even to your brothers When have you shown mercy to me? I have made efforts to find this plot of land to be your burial ground, satisfied? Lure him into the woods Chik Ming Sing, godfather says you're smart but you've fallen into our trap this time Your three-sectioned stick is useless in the woods Don't worry, I won't kill you now I'll take you back alive to face godfather You're dreaming Wait I'll show you something Double Sword in Sleeve These two are difficult to deal with What weapon did you use to kill them? It's not on them? Axe Axe? I asked too much Rising up from the Heavenly-Mountain The moon lay over the clouded ocean And the wind that has come a thousand miles, beats at the Jade Gate battlements... China marches its men down Baideng Road, while Tartar troops peer across blue waters of the bay... And since not one battle famous in history, sent all its fighters back again, The soldiers turn round looking toward the border, eyes and think of home with wistful And of those tonight in the upper chambers, who toss and sigh and cannot rest. Friend, why do you suddenly have a heavy heart? Have you changed? This poem is Li Po's Kwan Shan Yue It represents some peoples' sentiments meaning one could not return to one's home I am even worse I have no home at all I knew you are no ordinary man and you carry a lot of hate, right? Right I am full of hate I am looking for an arch villain What an irony, I am escaping from my enemies and you're searching for your enemy Are you joking with me? Do I look like I'm joking? Can I help? No Your future looks bleak Chik, if you really kill Yoh Xi Hung, are you... going to restructure the gang & become boss yourself? Are you going to recruit some killers under you? No such interest I will search all over for someone Search for someone? I have sworn that if I die... I hope I will die at his hands because I owe him a blood debt Who is this? Se Ma Sun's son-in-law Cheuk Yi Fan Have you heard of him? No What does he do? Se Ma Sun is a prodigy of the martial arts world and opposes all villains Once he thwarted Yoh Xi Hung's plans to rob official salaries at sea and created a hatred between them So Yoh Xi Hung used the most cruel way to take revenge Father Master... Father Mercy What? Getting soft? Father... Master Mother...sister You...Yoh Xi Hung, don't think you've succeeded I curse you for killing my family you'll die an even meaner death As long as I don't die by your hands that's fine You'd better save your strength to report in hell Father... Se Ma Sun's daughter Se Ma Yu Chin is the wife of Cheuk Yi Fan, Double Sword Sleeve This last is for you Father I am looking for an escape just let me give birth to the child then die Good Since we can't kill Cheuk Yi Fan as he's not here just as well he kill his off spring Chik, I let you kill her Godfather, she is a pregnant woman You've really changed? Chik, you used to be the first to kill and rob yet tonight you won't kill even one person I know You still hate me for killing Wang An, right? No Then let's do it Are you killing or not? Yes My husband will avenge me You can't kill a pregnant woman Sir, you can't kill me No explanation will do Just brace yourself it'll be over soon Kill You killed her? I made a decision at that moment I could not die then No one on Se Ma Sun's family wanted to die so I had to live on to kill Yoh Xi Hung Can you do it alone? I know it's almost impossible but I must succeed Don't forget, at his side are always Lin Gin Ming and Fan Lun Let's go further we'll meet Vulture Yien Lin, Blue Eagle Wan Da The Owl Shou Kao Shing I've heard that among the Thirteen Eagles Vulture Yien Lin has the best kung fu The second one is Blue Eagle Wan Da and the third is you Black Eagle Chik Ming Sing You're well informed on the Iron Boat gang's background You'll have a hard time fighting them alone if you don't have a partner like me you will die Friend, we're not related in any way You've already helped me twice Not for fame or money so why did you do it? Not for anything, it doesn't matter Then can you tell me your name? Those words again, homeless... That's enough... Damn, what rotten luck The first batch has gone for half a month the second batch has gone for ten days Why is there no news of them? Right Chik doesn't have guts to travel by sea This is entire dominated by us We have reconnaissance in the city Then there are those officials who are dying to capture him That's why we have concluded he must have gone into the desert But... Big brother, there is no way that Chik could ...handle a few people by himself Don't underestimate him His kung fu is good and he is smart Godfather picked him because of these attributes But he misjudged him not realising he would be a rebel I don't respect Chik Alright...stop arguing Ten miles from here is a small town Pass that is the barren desert Tomorrow we'll check it out Sir Boss...we have customers At last Please, sir Will this be enough to buy your inn? I can't sell it, it's my business How can you do this? Can you outrun a rabbit? Sir, naturally the rabbit will run faster Is your head harder than the table? Sir, what exactly do you want? I want you to get out of here right now Yes Get lost quicker than a rabbit Yes Or I'll smash your head Wait Don't forget the silver on the table You can use it for lodgings and food Come back after a month Yes There'll be a couple of corpses here by then There'll be a couple of corpses here? Please bury them Yes Let's go Wait Leave your clothes My clothes? Sir, I... Strip Yes So you want to dress up as a waiter? Yes This is the last inn before the desert unless they don't come after you if they do they must rest here But they won't be easily deceived You're wrong, the smarter one is, the easier one will be deceived because they think they're smart Are you still around? Get lost Yes, let's go We must get rid of one of them first I agree Waiter, prepare food Great...gentlemen...here's business Gentlemen...have a seat It's rare to have customers at our place This is for taking the dust off you this is for soothing your weariness this is for quenching your thirst Waiter, ask your boss to come out I am the owner and the waiter I take care of the whole place here Just tell me what you need Then prepare a month's ration for the three of us Yes... Come back Have you seen two groups of people, seven altogether pass by here towards the desert? Let me think Ah, I've got it... There was a one-eyed gentlemen who was very generous with his money The bone is crushed I ask you again, have you seen someone aged about twenty seven, dressed in black with a three-sectioned stick pass here? I can't speak, please let go first Speak up Yes... The batch last time also asked about this person I told them but they wouldn't believe me and headed towards the desert to look for him What didn't they believe? The fact that, that person in black was... helping me with the dishes and other chores upstairs They didn't believe me lmpossible. Would Chik work here? Right, he can't bear such tasks What does he look like? Ordinary looking, under thirty dressed in black Don't let his huge appearance deceive you he is lazy and eats a lot; not a good thing Right, also his leg seems to have some problem Let me see...ah yes, it's his left leg He walks like this, see? He's walking with a limp He seems to have a huge problem with his leg Enough Old Six Yes Follow him and have a look Yes Gentlemen may I go now? Go on I'll go and prepare food and wine I'll be right with you Please Please Please Get up Get up... Cao Gao Shing It's you One down It won't be easy to deal with Yien Lin and Wan Da What about an ambush? It's risky We must kill one with only one strike otherwise... Let's do it then Stay up here, I'll go down Be alert Be careful of Yien Lin's Lethal Ring and his head, which can crush a rock Here's food and wine That gentleman said the kid in the kitchen is not the person you're looking for He's gone to the toilet with stomach trouble That's good, he'll eat more We have a house rule the first pot of wine is for travellers from afar It's free Cheers Waiter, where's the toilet? In the alley behind the kitchen Old Two, go and take a look The back of the kitchen Not a bad knife, right? How much has Chik Ming Sing paid to hire you? Can I be bought? Then who are you? Killer of pigs Old Two Don't waste your breath, he can't answer you nor can he help you Chik, even if someone helped you to kill me you can't escape Godfather I don't want to run anymore, I'll go and see him Friend, in such circumstances you should not speak too much, or you'll get soft and can't bear to kill Do you want to know who I am? You are... I'll say it only once, listen carefully I am Cheuk Yi Fan Chik A bunch of nincompoops No news up to now In a few days we'll go to Iron Boat gang You are aware Yoh Xi Hung's kung fu is not easy to deal with He also has two loyal followers Grey Eagle and Yellow Eagle It's not an even match you should... I should flee to escape death, right? Yes Aren't you afraid to die? Die? Everyone is afraid to die the question is what is one dying for? I did too many bad deeds and I hope I could atone for my sins with my life If I could live, all the better but if I die, I die in peace You have helped me a lot and you have saved my life I should involve you in this Chik Ming Sing, I haven't helped you in vain I may be an enemy What do you mean? Don't get me wrong I am just saying there is no certainty in this world I was just stating a universal truism Maybe your enemy is my enemy and you have done me a favour We have a complicated relationship It's actually quite simple We're getting more intimate We need each other Your enemy is Yoh Xi Hung mine is the Iron Boat gang You have a grudge against them? Everyone wants to kill outlaws not necessarily because of vengeance Excluding you Unless you team up with you there is no better way Chik Ming Sing is back... Chik Ming Sing, you dare come back... Traitor I guessed right, Chik will always be Chik You've killed Yien Lin Why haven't you fled? Why return to die? If I don't kill you I won't have peace This person must have come to accompany you to die Wrong, I've come to dig your grave Let's see about that Double Sword in Sleeve Cheuk Yi Fan Correct Chik, so much for good judgement you've found an enemy to help you You'll die for sure So it's really you Why didn't you kill me on the road to avenge your wife? I want to find the truth about the death of Se Ma Sun's family But I have said earlier, our grudge should not have lasted till now because we should join hands and kill our common enemy Yoh Xi Hung Alright then Yoh Xi Hung, you've always eradicated your enemy but you left me alive That means your time has come Although you two have joined forces you might not gain the upper hand Chik, death or alive is before you Listen to me Help me get rid of Cheuk Yi Fan and I'll forget the past Cheuk Yi Fan, you want to use him to get rid of me then kill him afterwards Chik, you've been tricked You should know that getting rid of me isn't that easy You tried your best but you'll die ultimately I will persist to avenge my wife Chik, you'd better help me get rid of him I don't think your three-sectioned stick is a match for 'Double Sword in Sleeve' Let's join forces Don't be tricked by him Would you forget I killed the twelve Eagles? They're all dead, what's the big deal? Besides, you didn't kill them all by yourself I have no children and the gang's... entire wealth will be bequeathed to you one day Chik Ming Sing, you must understand; If we fight, he'll be the winner But there is nothing to support your promise You've been with me since you were young when have I gone back on my word ...and lied to you? Godfather, you must stand by your words Stand by your words Cheuk Yi Fan, he killed your pregnant wife If you want to take revenge...please Dog Your loved ones have all died because of you Friend, I can't change my ways besides, I'd rather stay alive than have a good death Chik, what are you waiting for? Do it, quick Yoh Xi Hung, your cruelty over these twenty years ...have been wasted So it's easy to raise someone... but difficult to control his heart I have at last understood this and am able to discern right and wrong Cheuk Yi Fan, take your revenge Your wife's murderer is still alive My enemies are all dead I swore I'll die by your sword If you don't kill me... your wife would not rest in peace
