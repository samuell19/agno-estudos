I don't know how you make "pee" in those things. (radio chattering) [Radio Host] Make him that way. As brave old Joe used to say. Very conscious, we know what he used to say, right?

Hm, sorry, what? I want you to check my meter. Oh, uh, okay. Should I call MainCon again? No, no, um. How would you handle something like this? I, uh. Can you come in? Uh look, I'll tell you what, um. If you think that there's a problem with the meter, if you think it's running more than it should, here's what you do. Unplug everything in the house and wait about a half hour, and then go check the meter. If it's still spinning, then we know there's an overflow problem. And if that's the case, just give us a call and I'll come back. Okay? All right. - Have a good one. - Thanks. (crickets chirping) (woman gasps) (ominous music) (tools clanking) (tense music) Okay, Mrs. Goldberg, that should do it. I'll come back in a few days. See if we've caught anything. Oh, that's wonderful, Michael. And uh, if you wanna mention to your son as well, just that this stuff is highly toxic, so just stay away from it. (bombs exploding) [Ms. Goldberg] Honey! Don't touch the poison pellets in the kitchen! (bombs exploding) (men yelling) He knows. (whimsical music) My husband should be out here doing this. I can't get him to do anything around here. He's probably inside laying on the couch, reading the paper. (electricity buzzing) (birds chirping) That's it. Thanks, Michael. Yeah. Do you have to get a permit for that? Thank you. Thank you, Mitchell. Uh, Michael. Oh. Okay, where do you want it Mrs. Barrish? Mrs. Barrish? It's a free country. At least it used to be. Fucking Obama.

Okay, so like dimming or brightening? Both. Both? Yeah. Okay, so something like a brown out where the lights will dim down and then they'll come back real quick or. Yes. Yes, a brown out. Can you check the meter? I mean, it would, you know what, why don't I go check the meter again, and maybe we missed something the last time. Thank you. All right. It's to the left. Yeah, I remember. So, how's your day going? Oh. How well do you know that man? Because I think they're having sex parties over there. Hi. What are you doing? Stay right there. You, don't leave.

What's going on? I, look, why don't? Tell him I will leave the tip under the door mat, (knocking on door) And just leave the box by the front door and I'll get it, because I, I, if I don't hear him, I'm very busy right now and I may not hear the doorbell.

To torture and humiliate me. Iris, I'm trying- (Iris shushing) I'm trying to follow you here, I. Um. They follow me. From room, to room. Once, there was a screwdriver on the floor. It's not mine.

Yeah, keep waving that flag, Charlie potatoes. It don't mean anything. I heard on the TV that they're giving out these free transistor radios to protect yourself in case of a major emergency. What they don't understand is that the problem isn't out there. It's here! Right here in our neighborhood! The only way to protect yourself is to be vigilant. Thanks for your help.

Uh, so I was just over at the Hunt's with Davey and we were just making sure that their box was off. Box? Yeah, um, I put in the wrong numbers in the report and so I had to fix it, and I didn't want to disturb Davey, you know, from what he was doing. But he's the one with the book, you know? Sure Michael, but it is getting kinda late. Yeah, I just wanna tell you that what you saw was, was just a mistake. So, and I fixed it. I fixed it. So there's no need for you to worry about it. There's no need for you to ask any questions. There's no- Mr. Michael, I don't know what it is you're asking. What I'm saying is that you can't tell anyone about what you saw. It was a mistake and I've taken care of it. So there's no need for you to mention it to anybody. I mean, you know me, Dave, right? And I know you.

People say you've been showing peculiar behavior lately. (truck horn honking) (engine revving) I don't know if this stems from the problems that you're having at home, or the whole Hunt incident. Hunt, who said anything about the Hunts? - Listen. - Who said that? Was it the Mexicans? The landscaper, the JV crew? Yeah, did he call? Why would he call? That guy's been giving me shit lately. You go home. You take the rest of the week off. Okay. - You understand me? - Yeah. Michael, do I have to worry about you? Good.

My dad has one of those. He does? Are you a pilot, too? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Why are you drawing a police man? You know my dad? I do. We're friends, that's why I'm here. How's your dad doing? [Jaime] Good. You talk to him? [Jaime] Yeah, sometimes. He sounds like an important guy. Yeah, he probably just wants to make sure everything's okay. Make sure you're safe and stuff. [Jaime] Yeah. That's why I'm here, too. To make sure you stay safe. Yeah, um, did a man or a woman come and talk to you and your mom today? What kind of planes do you fly? I'll tell you in a second. What did they ask about? Were they who you were drawing? I don't know. Did you show them your pictures? [Jaime] Yeah. May I see them? [Jaime] No. Why not? [Jaime] They're inside. What are they pictures of? Do you fly Hornet Planes like my dad? Uh, people? Are they uh, pictures of people? [Jaime] Yeah. Ah, good, good, that's good. And uh, what about guns? Oh, you, you like guns? Did you draw any people with guns? [Jaime] Yeah. Did they, uh, did they look like me? [Jaime] Do you know if my dad's coming back soon. He would be here if he could. The man in the picture, did he look like me? [Jaime] Yeah. Michael! I don't know what happened to you, man, but frankly, I don't give a shit. If I ever see or hear you here again, I will call the cops. - Bill. You understand me? (ominous music) (intense music) Let me explain. Some guy comes in, starts putting in his laundry. I see him doing that, no problem. So I go in there and he goes to the change machine. Puts in a dollar, it doesn't work. So I'm doing, I'm in there with my back to him, and all of a sudden I hear this loud boom, boom, boom! What the hell's that? And then even more like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! So I look and I, I, I see a woman staring at him like, what the heck? I come running outside, and before I can see what the hell's going on, this guy runs out past me, right out the door. I look and I got a busted change machine. I got glass and coins all over the floor. Joey, do me a favor. Unload 14A, please. Yeah, no problem, Bobby. This way, right here. This is what I was telling you about. See, right there. (ominous music) (tense music) (bells jingling) (bells jingling) You're a hard man to find, Michael. Detective Schaefer. Burke. Burke. How you been, Michael? I've been alright. How you doing? Eh, I've been better, but uh, it is what it is, you know? So I heard you left. Oh yeah. I um, I moved. I mean, after I quit the Gardens. I, I heard you were let go. It was mutual. Uh, I'm sure. (Detective Burke coughing) Listen, have you been back to see the residents at all? No, no. I don't quite know what you mean. Yeah you do. Normally I have time to play games. This is not one of those times. Everything's got an expiration date, you know? You, me. So no games, okay? All right. All right, here's, here, why don't we do this, okay? I've been thinking a lot about our case. Every case to a detective, every case, means something. And this one means a lot to me. I've been thinking about it a lot. I've been thinking about you a lot. We have this kid, and uh, he's been drawing, let's say, some funny pictures. Does that mean anything to you, Michael? No. Should it? I gotta go, all right? It was nice seeing you. Michael, I don't even know where you live. Well, I'm not too far. Michael, seriously. I don't even have your address. 1241684th Road. What apartment? B. Yeah. Well, he stayed home today. So, you know, I'm making him some lunch, but. Yeah. Well, you know, I, I, I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm, I'm, I'm actually going out tonight. Ma, are you, with Carrie. Yes. You're nuts. What are you and daddy doing? (phone beeping) Good, okay, okay. Let me go because I have a lot of stuff to do, okay? (phone beeping) Yes, I will let you know the second that he calls me, okay? I don't know anything yet, okay? I love you. Let me go. Hi. Yeah? What, what, what do you mean? Really? Okay. I don't, I am happy, I. (horn honking) Tom, are you driving? If you're driving, you shouldn't be on the phone, okay? Are you really five minutes away? Okay, yes I, I am happy. I'm, okay, I will. I'll see you when you get here, okay? All right. All right. Yeah, I love you, bye. (phone disconnect beeping) (doorbell ringing) (TV chattering) [TV] There's nothing that can be done now. Jaime. Sit up, there's someone at the door. [TV] But you've had a few for some time now. For at least 12 hours, haven't you, Bigelow? [TV] I don't know. - You don't know? - No. (doorbell ringing) (TV chattering) Hi. Hi there. Hi, uh Michael. - Michael, right. How are you, what's up? Um, so I was just in the area. I just had to do a little work on um, uh, the kitchen sink two houses down, and this is the sixth, seventh one in a row that I've had to change. If you recall, about six months ago I was here and I was working on your kitchen sink. Anyway, the part that I installed is faulty. - Oh. - There's a recall. So I figured I might stop by and just change the piece out. Uh, does it, does it have to be like right now? 'Cause I'm kind of, there's a lot going on, so. Uh, well, it's very, very fast. I'll be in and out. It'll be about five, five minutes. Just for the kitchen? Yes, just the kitchen sinks. Um, five minutes? Yeah. (ominous music) Uh, okay. Jamie, say hi. (ominous music) Jamie, say hello. Don't be rude. Okay. Right this way. You know what? I have a bunch of crap in here. Do you want me to clean all this out or like, what do you? That's alright, I'll do it. Can I offer you something? No, thank you, I'm fine. You know what? Let me get out of your way. Let me take your jacket for you. Yeah, sure. What happened to your eye? Oh, I went a couple of rounds with Tyson. - Oh. - Like 27 years ago. [Linda] Ha ha ha. It never, never healed right. Uh, will you just excuse me for a minute? I'll be in the other room. (TV chattering) (ominous music) I know, I know. Listen to me, you can't send me emails. You can't show up at my job. My husband is coming home, okay? He's staying, for good. It, it's completely my fault. And I'm so sorry, but I'm so serious. Okay? I don't, I have no time. No, listen to me, Jim, this can't happen. (Linda sighs) (TV chattering) (dramatic TV music) - Hey! - Whoa. Uh, I need you to do me a favor. - What? - Um, so my boss is here. - Okay. - For whatever reason. We, uh, okay. So technically I'm supposed to go to the office first. I'm supposed to punch in and get the uniform with the logo and I'm off the clock right now. I don't mind, it's my pleasure, but if he finds out that I'm here in plain clothes, it's actually gonna be a lot of trouble. Okay. Thank you very much. [Linda] Yeah, hi. [Tv] I found George Rattles, Mrs. Phillips. He's been dead for five months. [TV] And he didn't steal a bill of sale? No, he didn't, but you might- (people chattering) Why should I? No, no, no, no. Just checking to see if everything is all right. You seem to be okay. Okay, yeah, no. I'll be moving on. - Thanks for checking. - Thank you. Okay. Bye bye, stay dry. - Enjoy your day. - You too. (ominous music) What was that? What was, what? Is there something happening here that I need to know about? That was your boss, right? Why was he asking specifically if you were here? Well, he probably got to the office and saw that I wasn't there, and then figured I was out on a house call, which I was. I just happened to not have my jacket and I don't want to get in trouble for that, 'cause that's silly. Do I have to call the cops? I don't think so. Okay. I think, I think you need to go now. I'll just get my stuff. (door creaking) - Daddy. - Tom. Hey! Tom. Who the hell is this? - You know him. - Hey, who are you? I'm the, Michael. [Linda] He's the groundskeeper. The groundskeeper. Yeah. Dad, can I show you my pictures? Sure thing, pal. Jamie, why don't you, why don't you run upstairs and grab, grab the paintings for daddy and we'll meet you up there, okay? You know, actually, why doesn't he stay right here? So tell me uh, Groundskeeper Michael, is there something wrong in my house I should know about? Actually uh, the pipes under the sink. What, what's wrong with the sink? There was a faulty piece. There's a recall, so I came to replace it. Why don't you show me the problem? I want you to show me the problem and what you brought to fix it. And I also want you to know, I fly and maintain F18 Super Hornets for a living. Groundskeeper Michael, I want you to show me. This is ridiculous. I'm gonna go. Oh, you have to show me what the problem is. Jamie, I want you to go to your room right now. 'Cause I spilled? No, no.
