[MUSIC PLAYING] We're here today with local Venice Beach children's author Joe Peterson, who has exploded onto the scene with what is going to be a series of nine tough love kids' books. Hello, Joe. -Hi, Aaron. How are you? -OK. Look at these kids-- this is incredible. So what can you tell us about this tough love aspect? It reminds me of the books I read when I was a kid. No coddling. This is not a warm and fuzzy book. It's not every day you have a cuddly little kitten devoured by vicious piranha. That's true. I think that the parents respond to the moral lesson. You know, if you don't listen to your parents, something bad will happen. And I think the kids really respond to the violence, you know? I think that kids actually really like violence. Who likes violence here? KIDS: Yay-- And fortunately, cats have nine lives, so this little kitty will be back for eight more hard lessons, and a collector's box set, no doubt. -We hope so. -OK. The author of "Mr. Kitty Feeds the Fish," Joe Peterson. Thanks for being with us, Joe. Thanks for having me. In Venice Beach, I'm Aaron Aaronson. Back to you in the studio. [MUSIC - TD LIND] Back from being lost, lady, I got sidetracked, yes, easily done. Because sometimes you get so jaded, you get caught up, hung by a thread on that invisible hub. We are the words that never get said. We are the voices banging 'round in our heads. We all believe we're original ones, some just hit rock bottom and just don't get up. I just saw rock bottom so I filled my cup. Ooh-- Ooh-- JOE: I ran into this woman today out on the boardwalk. She had these-- these four dogs with her. And they were all tied to four different leashes, and they were yapping, and, and she had this one that was-- she was holding it at her chest, and he was a baby. Guess what they were wearing? Woolly sweaters. Frank? Question. Do you think they have those little woolly sweaters for every day, or just for the cold days? I mean, do they feel naked if they go outside without any clothes on? You thirsty? There you go. Hi. -Come on, babe. When are you going to take care of this stuff? My day was great. Thank you very much. Some of those are from today, you know. God, why haven't you paid this yet? When did you get your advance? March. And you sent the book in, when? July? Ooh, hey, look-- ha, ha, ha. Here's one from the publisher. Oh, but I guess it's not that important. Lorraine, it's not done. There's something missing. There's no magic. No-- no-- no magic. Your deadline was six months ago. And they paid you already. I'm working on it. You know what? We can talk about this "again" when you get back, and when I get back. But can you please just, I mean-- get it together? [CLUNK] What is this? Joe? JP. What are we doing? Oh, [INAUDIBLE]-- we're fighting. So, uh, how's, how's the new book coming? It's about a fly, you said? I thought it was about a cat. A lost fly. I'll show you. You see, he's out looking for rotted fruit for his little maggots. And then he gets trapped in a passing car. And then he gets swept away from his family. Huh. Kind of a homeward bound, feel good story. Yeah. -Who wants to grab a beer? -I do. Da da da-- dad's gift. Let's check this out. Two plane tickets, and a near-death experience. Every man in my family, after his 35th birthday, comes here and takes the plunge. Everyone in my family. My father, his father, his father's father-- Your family's insane. Yes. But all of those fathers swear that there's nothing better than jumping into ice cold water on Christmas Day. Sets your spirit straight. Washes away your past. Fresh start. And wasn't that the whole idea for the trip anyway? We go away, I train for the Polar Bear Plunge, and you, uh-- -And I write my book. Exactly. I'm telling you this, this place is perfect for you. Peaceful, quiet, remote, no distractions. A little "Joe time" as a bachelor. Mm. I could definitely spend a little time away from Lorraine. Yeah, she's nuts. -Ah-- thank you. -Thank you. You bet. Here's to rejuvenation. Oh. And to your birthday. Mm. -Happy birthday. -Thank you. I don't know, Joe. I thought that was pretty good, about the lost fly. Yeah, it's coming along. Great. Lorraine? [MUSIC PLAYING] [HORN HONK] -Joe, we gotta roll. -Give me a second. Hey, it's me. Listen. All right, sorry. [HORN HONK] -Two minutes. He was my friend. And you flushed him down the toilet. I can't forgive you for that. [MUSIC - TD LIND] Hard times is what this called for, I best be on my way, no love shadow beside me, I feel so sad and free, he knows what once not waving, his heart was once complete, his life, so, so contrary, this town was just more sweet. Oo-- Oo-- Oo-- Oo-- Ah. Whoo. Thank you. Come again. Schedule's on the back. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. My friend? Welcome to five miles from the end of the road. People live here? We're going to head up soon. Do you need anything? I need a cup of coffee. It's a little cold-- you want one? No, I'm good. But, uh, coffee at the Viking Grill. OK. I'm going to arrange, uh, transport for our last leg. Why don't you meet me back here in a few? All right. [MUSIC PLAYING] You're done? Ice fishing. Welcome to Wisconsin. Thanks. You could tell I'm not from around here. No, it was a lucky guess. Uh, you here for lunch? No. Just a cup of coffee to go. She's single. Never married. That's good to know. So where are you from? California. Yeah? It's pretty there. It is. This is a nice change of scenery, though. It is. Thank you. Here you go. How much do I owe you? Don't worry about it. My lucky day. Guess so. I'll get you next time. -That's for you. -Ah, don't worry about it. I'll get you next time. -I insist. It's OK. Thank you. You're welcome. It's OK. Stay warm out there. Thank you. Merry Christmas. -Bye. Bye. He's cute, right? This got me thinking. What is it? -Ice fishing postcard. -OK. All right, how about this for an idea? It's a little kid. He's ice fishing. -Yeah? And he's sitting there, and all of a sudden he gets a tug on the end of the line. -OK. -All right? And he reels it up, and at the end of the line there's a note that says "come play with me." -A note. -Yeah. There's a whole world underneath the ice, you know, that only kids can go and play. You know, during the wintertime. What do you think? -Kids. Yeah. What do you think? Kids under the ice. Right. Yeah. I smell a law suit. [MUSIC PLAYING] Whoo. -You don't have a car up here? -Nah. It's more fun this way. My aunt and uncle left this morning for the Bahamas, so, eh, it's just you and me, bro. Nice. OK. Except for write-- that's you-- train-- that's me-- we got a total of two things to do while we're here. It's beautiful. It's perfect. Home, sweet home. And all this. It's a whole lot of-- BOTH (UNISON): --nothing. They keep this warm. Kind of a haven for passing snowmobilers, cross-country skiers-- Wayward psychos with chain saws-- Wow. Nothing changes. Just give it a good pull. Turn and pull. There you go. OK. You see this flame? The flame heats the rock, the rock heats the room. Cool. Now, they want us to make sure that it stays lit. JOE: OK. I'll pretty much take care of this. Good. Wow. Whoever rigged the heat in this place showed quite an imagination. The other thing is, we have to feed Boo. Who's Boo? The fish. Boo, the fish. Come on. Boo-- -Ah-- --is actually Boo the 19th. Every winter, the poor little guy dies, and every spring he is replaced by his successor. You want to be in charge of the fish? Yeah. I think you guys are going to be good friends. Yeah. What, are you gonna cry? I might. Hey, Boo. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Pretty sky, isn't it? -Yep. It is. Chilly. You'll get used to it. Wow. Wow. Nice tights. Thanks. What's the plan? The plan is to focus. My father focused. My grandfather did. His father before him. Focus. Whoo! Whoo. Here we go. Wah-- oh, yeah-- that's nothing. Nothing. Feels good. Come on in, the water's fine. I'm gonna take a rain check. Nothing-- whoo! It's easy-- I got this. I'm gonna go for a walk. Whoo-- whoo! Come on, there-- whoo! [MUSIC PLAYING] It's not that cold at all. Whoo! We're looking good. Looking good. [SNARL] I'm an animal! A chimp! Whoo! It'll happen-- [SNARL] Oh-- Oh-- [GROWLING] Ah! -JP! What happened? What happened? What happened? The-- the bad-- badger! Wolverine! This biggest frickin' werewolf-- I don't know! Who were you trying to focus on-- the badger? Help, somebody! All right-- who do you want me to call? I'll call-- -Anybody with a Band-Aid! Get up-- get up here. Let me get you inside here-- -Ah! -Get inside! -Slow-- slow-- slow-- Hey, Sheriff-- we found him by the woodpile. We got a regretsome badger here. We might want to let Animal Control know. Yeah, he's pretty close to the house. Got him in the, um-- I can see that. Can't I? You made the call. What happened? -I don't know. I wasn't with him. I went for a walk. I heard him screaming. Could've been a squirrel. A squirrel? You think a squirrel could do that kind of damage? Gathering nuts for the winter. Don't worry. We, uh-- we got us-- we got some good doctors up here. Not the head shrinkers, though. Why was he outside in those panties? He some kind of thespian? No, he was in training. He was getting ready for that, uh, Polar Bear Plunge. Ah. I guess when a man turns 35 in his family, you know, it's jump into a frozen lake. Those people. Fruitcakes. You're the best friend, are you? -That's right. DR. KOOSA: That's a pretty nice tape job. Hell of a lot of blood, though. It's a good thing that he was so cold. Yeah, his twins were sucked pretty tight up against the body. -Trying to stay warm. -Yeah. Warm. Well, at least they're both still there. I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that. Can you fix this? I need to make a phone call. There's a great testicle specialist down in Milwaukee-- Dr. Fishburn. Specialist. Just to be sure. That's a pretty delicate area, as you can imagine. And she-- well, he-- but-- she used to be a he. I thought that was urban legend. Fishburn is a hell of a doctor. They say she did her own surgery. Wait, wait-- wait a minute. I thought we were trying to save his. Yeah-- of course. A different kind of operation, but, uh, you know-- -In the same neighborhood. -Right. Same neighborhood. Ooh. [MUSIC PLAYING] What are you talking about? I don't believe this. I don't believe-- what? Hello. [PUMPING SOUND] [HE LAUGHS] Hey. How you doing? Ah-- ah-- oh-- ow-- ah-- ow-- Uh, he's got a touch of fever. It's making him a little cuckoo. Uh, he's lost some blood. He may be short a testicle at the end of the day, but he should be just fine. I'm sure it'll be quite the conversation piece. JP: Listen to me. I'm sorry. It looks like you came all this way-- ah, ha-- ha, ha-- oh, ah-- you came all this way for nothing. No. It's not for nothing. You OK? [INAUDIBLE] me. Ha. I can't-- [INAUDIBLE]-- Joe. Joe-- come, come over here. I got to tell you something, Joe. All right. I'm-- I'm here. Ah! Ah-- ah-- Stop it-- Hey, hey, it's me-- stop it, JP-- Go away-- get away from me-- JP-- No, no, no-- got-- out of this-- It's me-- hey-- hey-- it's me! It's me. Ah-- You came to visit me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yeah, I-- I've been here. I'm here. You have to promise me. You have to promise me something. OK, I'll do whatever you want. What do you want? I promise. Um-- what was I saying? Um-- that-- that woman-- You mean the nurse? Mm-hm. She's trying to kill me. You gotta sneak me out. She's nuts. -Are you kidding? -I'm afraid you have to go. I have to change his dressing. Make sure nothing's rotten. Come on. All right. Well, thanks for your help. You don't have to thank me for doing my job. [BANG] What was that for? You'll know when I'm around. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BANG] Ugh-- it's freezing in here. Where's the thermostat? Are you kidding me? Thermostat? Come on. I'm gonna die. JOE (TELEPHONE): Hey, Dr. Koosa. This is, uh, Joe Peterson. JP's friend. DR. KOOSA: Joe. I was just about to call you. We have some news. -Excellent. DR. KOOSA (TELEPHONE): We were able to patch him up. Good. And I'd say, based on Fishburn's assessment, that we have about a 90% chance of two saved testicles. Great. Thanks. DR. KOOSA (TELEPHONE): Yeah, it's looking good. Or was that a 2% chance of 90 saved testicles? Ha, ha, ha. I'm kidding. Hello? Joe? Hello? Yeah, hello? Yeah, hello? There's a bunch of people outside, and they have guns, and they're dr-- no. Like a gang or something. No, I'm fine. Can you just send some people over right away, please? Yeah, I'll hold. [TELEPHONE RING] I know you're not from around here, but-- Who is this? Because man has driven the natural predators of the service [INAUDIBLE] from the region, their population tends to grow beyond the capacity of their food supply. Service [INAUDIBLE]? Who is this? SHERIFF ANDERSEN (TELEPHONE): The Sheriff. But we, as a community, have decided that, as an alternative to having hundreds of them starve to death-- Sheriff, are you going to send some people? There's-- --we would allow a predator to manage their numbers in a pseudo-natural way. JOE (TELEPHONE): Sheriff, look, I'm not really interested in your Latin studies philosophy, OK? There's a bunch of guys outside with guns on their backs-- We shoot the deer. We shoot them. And then we eat them. It's hunting season. That gang has a hunting license. They're not there to rob you. They're your neighbors, and your friends. OK? You should be making them a nice cup of cocoa. They're doing their civic duty. -Right. Uh, cocoa. They have permission to be on that property. Do you? Yeah, I-- I think I-- yeah, I do. I think I-- Good. Then just let them know you're there. Keep your head down. [BEEP] [DIAL TONE] Yeah, it does look cold out there. Hey-- [GUNSHOT] Ah, shit-- oh-- my left nut-- What the hell's wrong with you? I was just trying to offer them some cocoa. I was just trying to be nice. Sheriff, this might be another trip to the specialist in Milwaukee. Yep. Looks like it grazed his sack. You're just a regular good luck charm, aren't you? You don't just call out to a man holding a loaded weapon. -Idiot. -Moron. Sheriff? There's no cocoa. There's no milk. No milk, no cocoa. No shit. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] AXEL ANDERSEN: Come in. Catch one of these things just at the right time-- sit-- you might get two meals out of it instead of one. Oh, yeah. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha. Yeah. It look like we got ourselves a mother. Who the hell are you? -My name's Joe. I saw you here yesterday. You were snooping around my property? No, no, no, I wasn't snooping. I just-- I went for a walk. Walk? Nobody goes for a walk around here. It's goddamn 10 degrees. It was a nice walk. [THUD] A week in Fort Lauderdale's nice. Look-- I'm staying up at a farm at the end of the road with a friend of mine who's not there right now because he got bit in the balls by a badger. I know I'm a stranger, but I got a heater that I don't know how to turn on, and I got a goldfish that's going to die unless I do something. Can you-- can you give me a hand? Yep. Where exactly did you say you were staying? Up there at the, uh, end of the road. You know, that white house? Oh, the white house? Gray barn? Yeah, I know it well. I used to live there. My old man built the place. I had to sell it after he died, about 20 years ago. Why'd you sell it? Ah, I couldn't do the fishing and smoking all by myself. -Oh, yeah-- smoking? -Smoking. Smoking fish. Well, my son, selfish bastard that he is, didn't want any part of the family business, so I had to sell the house to protect my ass. He never forgave me for it. But you still can't beat the view. Especially in the summer. Cute kid. Who's-- who's that? Oh, that's Sif. She works up around here on the holidays. Sif. What kind of name is Sif? Sif. Wife of Thor. God of thunder. Sif. [MUSIC PLAYING] There-- you see that lever there? Yep. You want heat, you crank it around like that. All right. Now, it's on a mechanical timer, so it'll kick off after about, oh, 18 hours, so cock it back once a day. -OK. Once a day. So why are you here? Me and my friend came up here to do the iceberg jump. So I figured this'd be a good time to focus on my writing. You know, a place like this, there can't be that many distractions, right? They sell these human waste bricks at the sewer processing plant in Milwaukee. It keeps the deer away-- you know, the stink of it. So they don't eat the buds. Huh. It's a nice place to visit. I don't know if I could survive here forever, but it's a nice place to visit. -Come here. I want to show you something. You're welcome to take one of those buckets with you as an air freshener, if you like. Oh-- why, thank you. No matter what time of the day, or year, this is my favorite spot. Nobody comes up here. Breathtaking. Thanks for your help-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Axel? Wow. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGH] You left that. Easy to tell whose hat that is. Colorful. Thanks. Cover it up, big man. We've got places to go. Half the day is gone already. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HE CHUCKLES] I like to use cheese in the winter time. Bright colored. Attracts the trout. Drop it on in there. All right. Oop. Now what? We wait. So you been up here your whole life? Well, my dad moved up here from Oklahoma in 1941. And, uh, after I got out of school, and he liked it so well that my brother and I came up here and joined him. Haven't been anywhere since. Except for a trip to Cuba. And after they closed that down, no point in going anywhere else. Don't you go stir crazy out here? I mean, I've seen pictures during the summer, but how long are the winters? Ah, October until March. Maybe early April. Early April. Five months. Well, the only really shitty part's three. Yeah. Three months. That's still a long time. How do you stay sane? You think I'm sane? You're pretty much the sanest person I've met since I've been here. What's your secret? My granddaughter. Sif. You met her at the Viking. Sif's your granddaughter? Mm-hm. You also met her father. Who's that? The Sheriff. -Sif and the Sheriff? -Yep. Father and daughter. Odd pair. That is an odd pair. CHOIR LEADER: All right-- from the chorus. (SINGING) Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day, to save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray, oh, tidings of comfort and joy-- [JOE JOINS IN] --comfort and joy-- oh, tidings of comfort and joy. That was nice. And youse? Ah, just bring us two burgers with cheese and two beers. You want cheese? -Yep. Yeah, cheese, and two beers now. I need one. I like that song. Reminds me of my grandma. Yeah. Honey-- ooh-- Very nice. We were five. And Irma was our low voice. We sounded like a bunch of damned birds without her here. Twittering away. And we have the Christmas chorus to do over the holidays. Where is Irma? I just saw her. Axel-- she died last week. And now we're short a baritone. I'm sorry about your loss, ladies. It must be very hard during the holidays. Hey, she was 88. When you gotta go, you gotta go. You gotta go. So what are you going to do? Well, that depends on your availability. We have a couple more rehearsals. And we can get a costume just for you. And I'll drive you. All right. I'll do it. Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, tidings of comfort and joy. -All right. Here we are. Step up. Why do you suppose they didn't ask me to be in the choir? You kept trying to goose them. You scared them off. [AXEL LAUGHS] All right, you're all set here? Ah, yeah. I'm good. -All right. -I'm good. -Sleep well. Um, fishing tomorrow. Come see me. All right. Good night. Have a nice walk home. Yeah, thanks. Oh, tidings of comfort and joy. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey. -Hi. What are you doing out here? Uh, just learning how to do a little ice fishing with Axel. Oh, really? I like that you're-- what's in your book? -Oh, it's just some sketches. -Yeah? A little writing. I used to write. Really? Anything I'd know? I doubt it. Try me. 12 pages about a cat that feeds a fish. And the title would be? Drum roll, please. "Mr. Kitty Feeds the Fish." -Are you kidding me? -You know it? -I loved that book. -You don't know it. I do know that book. What happened in the next one? It didn't happen. Really? Kind of hit a little bit of a writer's block. Oh, that's too bad. [A DOOR CLOSES] Oh, my God. It's Grandpa. Axel? -Grandpa, are you OK? -What happened? Are you all right? Can you hear us? AXEL ANDERSEN: Who are you? You know what, Grandpa? Just-- just save your breath. OK? We're almost there. Just be quiet. It's gonna be all right. [SPEED DETECTOR BEEPS] Well, what now? There he is-- here we go, here we go-- OK, we found him at his ice shack. I think he fell and bumped his head. There was blood on the ice, I was-- Yeah, he's been talking a lot. He doesn't really remember who we are. Sif-- Dad. Hey, we found him at his ice shack, and I think he fell-- I was out there skating-- Why is he here? Well-- because he's, he's helping, Dad, he's my friend-- He doesn't belong here. This is a family matter. We're taking him down for a few tests. Hi, Sheriff. We'll wait here. Grandpa has been talking about him. You know they're friends. He is living in our old place-- did you know that? He is in my house, and now what, he's best friends with my father and my daughter? We don't know him. He is not from around here. He-- This man, Dad, is a good man. He has been a good friend to your father, who you rarely visit. He joined the church choir. He probably even saved Grandpa's life just by being there. And he is a good tipper. I came back because you promised me you would quit trying to stop me from living my life. I am trying. Isn't this trying? You said you were going to support my decisions, Dad. What's it going to be, Sheriff? Joe, you met the Sheriff? My father. Yeah. We have. I'm so sorry. -Ha-- -How are your balls? (SINGING)They're hanging in there. -You all right? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm feeling all right. I, uh-- still not so mobile, but I got a card from my sister. She asked about you. What'd it say? NURSE: Mr. JP. Meet your new roommate, Axel Andersen. Try to give him some quiet. Sif. Come meet JP. Oh, hey. JP, this is Sif. JP's here on a bit of a sporting accident. Really? What happened? Oh, I, uh, I was working out in the snow, just trying to get used to the extreme cold. I'm in training for the Polar Bear Plunge. Really? Yeah. Most people here, we just sort of pull out a bottle of Schnapps, and then hit the water, so-- Well, I, I, I like to think of it more as a specialized training technique. Is what you call it? I train a lot myself. Hockey. Oh. My season starts in Pittsburgh in two weeks, so I've been on the ice a lot. Are you, uh-- are you going to still do the plunge, or-- No. I'm a little out of commission. But Joe has actually agreed to take my place. Wow. That is some pretty extreme cold, my friend. I actually-- I can't swim. Come on. A little cold water isn't going to scare a big bull like yourself, Joe. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here we go. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here we go-- oh, God-- God-- water. Water. Ha-- hot. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] My lovely daughter said I was, and I quote, a "rude son of a bitch" to you. Well, you probably didn't mean it-- Oh, bullshit. I was. I intended to be. I don't like you. I don't like you because you're in this house. I don't like you because you're socializing with my family, and I, I don't like you because, for some damn reason, my precious daughter has taken a shine to you. Well, I think she's very-- I know what you think. I think you're a damn nut job. I'm standing here talking to you and your mostly naked shivering ass. It's 22 degrees and snowing. I don't know how you wound up here, or what you think you're doing here-- Sheriff? What do I have to do for you not to shoot me? Here's what. I'll be here at 7:00 AM. You and I will bond. I usually don't get up at 7:00 AM. 7:00. On those steps, right there. Hey, Sheriff-- I don't bond before breakfast. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] [SIGH] Viking Grill. It's Sif. -Hi. It's Joe. SIF (TELEPHONE): Hey. I'm sorry about earlier, with my dad. I talked to him. JOE (TELEPHONE): Yeah, yeah, he, um, he paid me a visit a few hours ago. A visit. We're scheduled for an early morning bonding session. Oh, God. I am going to kill my father. He, um-- he's a little overprotective. Sorry. -Yeah, that's OK. I have good people skills. Yeah. You do. Is that why you called? No, actually. I'm starving. Do you guys deliver? Do we deliver? No. I'm kind of stranded here. I don't have a car. Well, you did help save my grandfather's life. And being the lone carless traveler that you are in a foreign land, I will have Jeffy bring something right over to you. JOE (TELEPHONE): Thank you. -Yeah. Well, I do know where you live, after all. What can I get for you? [ALARM CLOCK RINGS] What does anyone do at 7 o'clock in the morning? [DISTANT RIFLE SHOT] [DUCKS QUACK] 'Morning, Sheriff. [BOOM] Duck soup all around. No, wait. It's deer season, isn't it? [RIFLE COCK] Well, take your pick. This one's prettier. But this one-- well, nothing like the feel of real wood. Now, what you gotta remember is, you never point a loaded weapon at anybody. Right. All right, Never point a-- And you gotta always, always stay cognizant of where your fellow hunters are. Cognizant. That means aware. -Right. Be aware. OK. OK. Now, what you want to do, hold it like me. Put the butt right up in here. Now, it's got a kick, so you want to keep it nice and tight up against your shoulder. -Like this? Uh-huh. All right. Now, that baby's got shells in it, so you release the safety, take your mitties off-- take the mitties off. Push that. This button? That little button right there. All right. Now, just aim it out into the field, all right? Don't worry, the grass will grow back. All right here we go. Have at her. [BOOM] There you go. Try another. Pump the action. Almost. I like the way that sounds. That sounds pretty good. -OK. [CRACK] [LOUD EXPLOSION] [LAUGHTER GROWS] Every day. Every damned day of my childhood, I had to check the flame in that damned shed. My mother built it for my father. Something about a sanctuary. A place to write his poetry in peace. -Axel was a poet? -Yeah. Who would've thought, huh? Yeah, he was a romantic. Well, when she died he stopped the writing. But in her honor, he insisted we keep the shed all shined up, and warm. I guess it's warm now. Can't get any warmer than that. Once or twice, I sort of toyed with the idea-- running it down with my cruiser. I owe you one. I got places to go. Bonding. How did it go? He blew up the shed. He blew it up with one shot. A shot. Yeah. Well, the flame must have gone out. And the place filled up with gas, and big, giant fireball. Wow. I am really-- I'm, I'm sorry, Dad. I know that that place really meant a lot to you-- I hated it, honey. I hated the shed. I know that your grandma built it. We all-- for me, it's-- it's just a lot of bad memories. So I know you're fond of him. Mm. Thanks. Yeah. So I'm going to see your granddad. Good. I'll send him your love. I love you, Dad. Thank you. Ah-- God. Ah. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello. Hey, Joe. JOE (TELEPHONE): Hey. What's up? How's it going? How's the book coming? It's coming along. You know. There's been a few distractions along the way, but it's coming along. What's the prognosis over there? You, uh, still on track for being a man? (HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) I think so. (NORMAL VOICE) Ahem. I mean, uh, I think so. The doc says it's coming along, and, uh, and things should be fine with the, uh, with the twins, as he says. Right. The twins. Good. [KNOCK] Hey, uh, look, I got to-- I got to run. I've gotta go to choir practice. What are you talking about, choir practice? I'll explain later. I gotta go. My ride's here. Make sure you call me back, because I need to tell you-- [CLICK] --something. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. I'm trying to take care of things. She's grown up. She looks-- she looks just like her mother. I'm trying not to hold on too tight. [MUSIC PLAYING] That's a good boy. You were about to strangle her to death. [MUSIC PLAYING] ALL (SINGING, UNISON): God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay, remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day, to save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray, oh tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy, oh tidings of comfort and joy. Whoo! Whoo! That was really good. No, it wasn't. It was so not really good. Well, you tried. Ah-- it was painful. -I used to sing with them. -You did? Mm-hm. -In the choir? -Mm-hm. Like a bird. Like my mom. She had a really nice voice. You must be more like your mom. I mean, I don't see a lot of your father in you. Will you, um-- will you go on a date with me? -Uh-- -Oh. Of course. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. Nice. Thank you. You've thought of pretty much everything. -Almost. -Yeah. Cheers. -Cheers. Thanks. Ah. This is-- this is really nice. This is pretty amazing. Yeah. My parents used to take me here when I was a kid. A lot of memories, I bet. The sheriff actually had a good time. -He did? -Mm-hm. I talked to him about you today. What'd you say? I didn't say much. He talked to me about you. -Really. Mm-hm. What'd he say? -He said he approved of you. -Really. -Mm-hm. -Huh. You know, I think, um-- I think that these are oven mitts. -Yeah. -They're very cute. Yeah, this is, um-- this is kind of new for me. -Yeah? -Yeah. Me, too. [MUSIC - THE OLD '97s, "QUESTION"] She woke from a dream, her head was on fire, why was he so nervous? He took her to the park, she crossed her arms-- You're not getting these back. No, I want-- I've gotta have them back. My hands are freezing. Mm-mm. You're going to have to come get them. I'll come get them. THE OLD '97s (SINGING): Someday somebody's gonna ask you a question that you should say yes to, once in your life, maybe tonight I've got a question for you. She'd had no idea, she started to cry, she said in a good way, he took her by the hand, walked her back home, they took the long way. Someday somebody's gonna ask you a question that you should say yes to, once in your life, maybe tonight, I've got a question for you. LORRAINE: Hi, Joey. Did you miss me? What are you doing here? Well, this is my family's house. And, um, I missed you. I talked to JP, and he told me that you're, you're writing again, and you seem happy, and he said you're helping him take care of things around here, and you're taking his place in that stupid competition. I really didn't think you had it in you. So here I am. And babe, I-- I forgive you. Come here. Mm. Let's have a cup of coffee. OK. Coffee sounds great. What time did you get here? About 3:00 AM. 3:00 AM. Where did you sleep? Oh, I didn't sleep. I just stared. At you. All night. Wow. What? You looked so peaceful and happy. So let me see. JP said the book idea is really good. Let me see. -It's on the table. It's not ready for you to look at. It's just not done. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh-- look at the cute little buggers-- so cute-- I have to explain something to you. What? You know, you were right, about me being lazy, and my, my writing, and, you know, not listening to the signs. I'm glad you think so. But you're crazy. OK? You're nuts. You flushed my fish down the toilet. You actually just flushed my fish down the toilet. You killed my fish. -Joey. [SMIRKS] What is this? This is Frank? It was for your own good. It was tough love. How could you do that? -Oh-- oh, baby, come here-- -No-- Come here. You little shit. I'm happy here. I've been inspired. I'm writing a lot. And you'll keep writing. Come on-- come home-- You're not getting it. OK? I think this time apart has been good. Look, I made a promise to your brother and a promise to myself that I was going to finish the book. Which I'm sure you don't understand. Let me get this straight. You would rather be here, in the middle of nowhere, with a bunch of backwards hillbillies with pointless lives, than at home, where you can actually do something with your life, with me? They're not hillbillies. Get your bathroom stuff. We're going. Lorraine, we are not going. I am doing something here that's making me feel good. OK? I'm feeling good for once. Finally. Lorraine-- I met somebody. I met somebody who makes me feel good. Who's funny. Who's real. Somebody that I want. I don't want you. I don't want us. I don't, I don't want this. I'm sorry. I don't understand. I don't want this. [TIRES SQUEAL] I came here to give you another chance. But clearly, you're not interested. So then I'm not-- not interested then, either. You are not committed to this relationship! Jeez. [BANG] -Ugh. The sheriff. Lorraine-- I'm tired of you bossing me around. It's not really Frank. Ha! I'm here because I want to be here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Say. Can I get you something? I didn't get my coffee this morning. OK. We will get you some coffee. Do you like cream and sugar? [TEARS COME] Oh. Hey. No tears. Come on. What's wrong? He kicked me out of the house. Like a dog. He said he found somebody else. He said she was "real." I mean, real? What does that mean? I-- I mean, what did I do wrong? -Nothing. So he kicked you out, and he wouldn't even listen to you. When they want something, men are all ears. Yeah. And they're all hands. I mean, I was so happy to see him motivated and not shlubby anymore, and-- I mean-- maybe I could have held back a little, but-- [TELEPHONE RINGS] Viking Grill. This is Jeffy. Today's specials are the fresh pork butt, which is-- Uh, hey, Jeffy, is Sif there? Can I speak with her? This is Joe. Hold on, Joe. She's going to have to call you back. No, uh, can you tell her it's important? Thank you. Come again. Let's go clean up those tears, OK? Come on. Come on. What? OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on. There you go. Behave. SIF: OK? Yeah. Thank you. You're OK. Beautiful. You're going to rock this. You're going to rock him. You're the man. Without a doubt. You're really sweet. -Thank you. -Thank you. You're gonna be great. You're just fine. OK. Go get him. -OK. Go get him. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah-- I think you've gone crazy, or you're sick or something, because you don't want to let me go. Mm. Mm hm. Mm. Oh-- ah-- You're so much a part of me and a part of my family-- when I heard you saying that you were seeing someone else, well, it's-- it's just crap. And another example of you lying to yourself. Right? Mm. Mm. Babe-- Did you hit your head? Uh, yeah. Come with me. [INAUDIBLE] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hey, there. Hey, Daddy. If you've got a minute, I need a word. Yeah. What's up? Can we go sit in the cruiser? -Oh. -Ooh. How you feeling? I'm fine. Good. Oh. I'm great, actually. I went on a, um, on a picnic with Joe last night, and he is-- he is really sweet. -OK. Good. I love you, honey. And I don't want you to think this is coming from a bad place. But this Joe guy-- -Nope. Nope. Are you-- -Listen to me. -No. Are you really going to do this now? Just listen to me. I cannot believe we're having this conversation again. What is it? Why can not-- -Sif-- You-- oh-- you just don't even want me to be happy. It's not that-- You want me under this rain cloud with you, and I just can't even-- We're not talking about rain clouds! And you're angry on top of it! I'm not ang-- I am not angry! I am not-- I am not angry. -Really? I'm not-- I'm not angry. That's not angry? He was with another woman this morning. Oh, my God-- I can't-- I saw him. You are unbelievable. I pulled in the driveway, and I saw him. I saw him. You're a liar, Dad. Little girl, I swear to you on my mother's grave, I saw him, this morning, through his kitchen window, in the arms of another woman. I shit you not. -I know you-- [HORN HONKS] MUSIC PLAYING] DR. SCHWEIBER: It looks like a mild concussion. Enough to cause some disorientation and some nausea. We'll have a better idea in the morning. I'll have a, a specialist in then. OK. Do you have a place to stay tonight? I could arrange for something here, or, uh-- do you have plans for dinner? Ooh. Hi. Where am I? Why am I here? Well, your fiancee brought you here. She said you banged your head. Almost threw up all over her car. And you're in the Sturgeon Bay General Hospital. Oh. I've been to Sturgeon Bay. Oh-- happy holidays. What day is it? It's Christmas Eve. Oh. Well, hey, you. Hey. You're looking better. Yeah, well, thanks. Yeah, I'm feeling better. How are you? How's Joe? I don't know. He's gone. Gone? Some old girlfriend resurfaced. I don't know the details. Oh. I didn't know. Sorry. I'm gonna go. Sure. OK. Good seeing you. [MUSIC PLAYING] You scared me, with this trip to the hospital. Hello, gorgeous. How you feeling? Oh, I'm better. They found a little irregular heart beat, so they put in a pacemaker, but I'll be 100% in a couple of days. Good. -Hey, Joe sent this. -Oh. I do like him. Yeah. I liked him, too. I'm gonna take off. I love you, little girl. I love you, too, old man. Hey. Why don't you stick around a little while. Maybe watch a movie. It's lonely here. JP just walked out of here. Are you trying to guilt me? Poor, lonely old man, laid up in a hospital? The winter snow falls, my gray mustache may freeze-- Are you making a haiku? --but we must wait for spring. I guess I just like your company. [MUSIC PLAYING] What are you doing here? I'm in the chorus. I'm the baritone. That's nice. Who's the blond, Joe? I saw her, and you, in the kitchen, looking a hell of a lot more than friendly. Now look, Sheriff? I don't know how to tell you this, but I think I'm in love with your daughter. What you saw was part of my past. And it was a long and painful goodbye, but right now I gotta get up on that stage and sing. OK? Hold this. (SINGING) God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay, remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas day, to save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray, oh tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy, oh tidings of comfort and joy. [MUSIC - THE CHORUS - "DECK THE HALLS"] Where is she? She was pretty broken up. She headed off to Pittsburgh this afternoon. She left early. Yeah, I guess. I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Life's funny like that. That was my bad. What's uh-- what's in the bag, anyway? Open it. Heater went out. Yep. Hey, look, uh, why don't you-- why don't you take Sif's room? It's upstairs at the Viking. The heater's on. It's cold out there. [MUSIC - TD LIND] Turn out the light, I've something to tell you. That from this night, I'm gonna love you. And no one else. No one I'm with. No one can because we rise together, fall together, like the wild, wild wind. Oo-- ah-- Those blue Montana eyes, they sure can haunt you. No eyes have, no eyes will. No one cares, because we rise together, fall together, like the wild, wild wind. POLAR PLUNGE ANNOUNCER (PA): Ladies and gentlemen-- welcome to the Polar Plunge. Conditions are brutal.
