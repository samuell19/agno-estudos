- What are we doing today? - I don't know. Yoshida! And someone else. Bring a roller from storage. Right. Let's go. Make a line. Hold this. Are you OK? Ito! What's the matter? Somebody! Bring water! Like Grains of Sand "Yoshida" What the hell are you doing? Weren't you sick? Come on! Let's go somewhere. - I want to go to the beach. - Are you serious? Did you shave your legs again? I can't swim. If you don't shave your legs, you'll be strong enough. Too many jellyfishes. Jellyfishes are supposed to be in the sea. - They are, but... - What's wrong? - Our competition is coming up soon. - We have practice. - Are you serious? - And you have summer school. How many Fs did you get on the finals? Me? Five. Impressed? - You going to be in trouble? - I'm fine. Summer school for you. No help here. Never lend him any books. He'll drool on them. Don't worry. My Fs are like roaches: They breed. Idiot! - Don't call me an idiot. - Stop! You spilled my drink. - It's too hot. - Judo moves. Wow... again... - Whats that? Construction? - Cutting stone. Right? That is... - Why are you smiling? Weird. - It's nothing. I wish they'd blow up the school! Idiot! - Don't call me an idiot. Shithead. - Ouch! My bones! Ito, tomorrow. - What? - To his place to borrow a bike. - I'll go with you. - You don't have to come. Just him? There aren't any buses if practice runs late. He has to take a long detour to go home. - My house is far away, too. - You'll be fine. - Why? - You're as tough as a cockroach. Don't say that. I can't believe it. - You don't have to come. - Why? I'll come, definitely. Yoshida-kun. Mr. Shinohara wants to you to come see him later. I think the music for the competition has arrived. Do you have a minute? Shimizu-san, I have to ask you a favor again. - Please. - What happened? My friend is in very bad trouble. Contribution, again? - Please. - Just a little is fine. - Help us. - Didn't you already collect? That was a different girl. And this time it's more serious. Butt out. She's 3 months already. It'll be awful if she can't abort early. - Please. - Please. We don't need much. - How much? - How much do you have now? I only have ¥1,000. That's enough! Please. - OK. Wait a minute. - Thanks. Aihara-san, how's it going? - I have a favor to ask you. OK? - What? My friend's gotten pregnant and has a big problem. She's got to abort soon. - I don't have any money. - Just a little. Just a little. I don't like doing this, either. She can't tell anyone and she cries all the time. I'm so sorry for her. ¥100 or ¥500 would be fine. You know you girls are "sympathy fascists". What's her problem? Aihara-san! Class starts soon. Where are you going? To the bathroom. Why didn't you go during break? Are you all right? Excuse me. You don't have a fever. But you look pale. - Are you having your period? - I'm OK. Are you? OK, go. Class is starting now. Stand up. Bow. Sit. OK, class. I've got the results of the finals. - Are you thermotyping your test? - Leave me alone. - That helps? - They're getting better, slowly. - You should be more serious. - Get off it! - Repeating a grade is lonely. - That's not funny. Want my books? - Let me copy them. - Pardon me. I'm going to band practice. Want me to bring your bag? Thanks. Are you going to the video arcade again? Yeah, I'm the president. - Are you going to practice? - Yeah. I'm leaving. - Get to work. - I can't do this shit. I'm... - Wipe there. The windowpane. - OK. Maniac. The upper window. Hey! Hey! Hey! Do that somewhere else. It's your fault for standing there. Move over. Don't give me any lip, son! Stop it. Idiot. Don't call me an idiot. - How much we got? - About ¥36,000. That's it? ¥20,000 per head and it'll be gone in one night. We'll have to pass the hat in other homerooms. Right. How about the class next to us? - That class had a lot of rich kids. - Really? Let's go then. This isn't enough. - Not enough. We need more. - Right. Shimizu-san. What are you doing? Cleaning. Good student. Did you hear us? I was tidying things up. Shimizu-san, I know we can count on you! - Bye. - Let's go. "Ito" "Yoshida" - Whats the matter? - Nothing. - You constipated? - No! Drink some milk. Milk cures constipation. No, I'm not. Watch. Here I go! - Super! What's that? - My special technique. What's that? - They upstairs? - I guess so. What do you want? You play the trombone. Isn't it too big for you? - No. - It is. Is this yours? "The Sound of Music"? Just for practice. Play. - Why did you come here? - Play. Leave if you don't have anything to do. I think a wood-wind instrument, like a flute, is more your size. Thanks. - Look who's here. - Aihara, joining the band? I haven't decided. - I'll play. - What? In the band. You were in the band at Kita High, right? How did you know? Did you hear that from Ms. Nezu? - What did you play? - Clarinet. Clarinet! Do we have one? We need another wood-wind. We'd love you to join the band. - But you might not be satisfied. - Shimizu-san. - Are you dating Yoshida-kun? - Sort of... That's 100-year-old news. You're too new. - How about you? - Ito doesn't have anybody. You must have someone you like in the band. - You didn't tell me. - You have, right? - I didn't know Ito had anyone. - I didn't say I have. I ought to know everything about Ito. No secrets between us, Ito. - Never. - Come here. This one? Not that one. - This one? - You can leave. How about this one? Are you listening to me? Answer me. This one? I don't think so. She has a boyfriend. - This one? - Pretty, but her feet stink. - You listening? - Who is it? This one? Not that one. She's no good. - I've got it! - Who? Tell me. Yoshida?! This one, right? - You and Yoshida? - Am I wrong? Are you a fag? Fag? Am I wrong? Tell me. - Who? Tell me. - I'm right. Leave. You're buzzing me. That's funny. I'm sure I'm right. Is she? What's going on? - We were talking about you. - Me? - Yoshida? What? - We were talking about you. - What about Yoshida? - What about me? I might join the band. - Then you can use this clarinet. - I have my own. See you! What's the matter with her? What's this? I thought I'd lend it to Aihara-san. - Do you want to come in? - What about your family? Dad's always late. - Who makes your meals? - I take care of my meals. That's tough. - I'm used to it. Do you want dinner? - Not tonight. - Next time. - Sure. Your bag. Could you take that off? That's it. OK. See you tomorrow. Thanks for the lift. Bye. - I'm still eating. Don't smoke. - I can smoke. My hairs going to smell. I shampooed this morning. - You can shampoo again. - No. - You enjoy it. - Mom! Why don't you put out your cigarette? What a smell. You're under-aged. Leave them there. You're drinking from the bottle again! I can't drink it later. It's gross. He's done it before. It's my bottle. He drank from it. - Hello. - Oh. Wait a second. - Hello. - Hello. I'll do it. Are you going out? Just to the garage. Go to bed. I have to open the bar. I can do the shopping. Can you? I'd like you to, then. This way. Are you OK? - Need some help? - I'm all right. Are you assembling it yourself? This. I'm impressed. I have a manual. How about a license? Not yet. Check the light. - It seems OK. It's old, but... - It's fine. Thanks. What are you doing? Sorry. Thanks. Something wrong? I mixed Calpico and milk. - As usual: a hot, messy room. - Come in. Use the front door. Too much trouble. Be careful. - Did you take off your shoes? - Don't worry. Don't break my watch. - What are you doing? - It's damn hot today. A fan, please! - Has anyone died from heat yet? - It's possible. I'm too hot to die. - Whats the matter? Depressed? - Nothing. Let me drink some. Just a sip, just a sip. - This tastes good. - Yeah? I made it. Mixed with milk. - Damn hot! - You can have another glass. - I'm bored. Anything to do here? - Like? Whatever. - How about "Don-jara"? - Kid's mah-jong? - With cartoons. - That's nostalgic. Shall I get it? I wouldn't mind playing. - What? - Karaoke. No. My mother's taking a nap. - Show some respect. - What? - When he sings... - What? - Don't start with sad love songs. - Why not? You get all dreamy-eyed. Not everyone's into that. - It's masculine sensitivity. - Shut up. Anyone with a poster like that wouldn't understand. You have my brothers taste. - It is your brothers taste. - How do you know? In junior high, we went with your brother to her mall appearance. - We did? - We got it then. - No way. - You don't remember? - Will you take it off? - Leave it. - Leave it. - I'll take it off. I envy you. Everyone except me has masculine sensitivity. Are you making fun of me? No. I'm not. it's just that life's so complicated. I have complications, too. - Sorry! - Be careful! "Treasure Island" Stop! Stop! - Look. There's Matsuo. - Right. - What do you think? - What? - Like her? - Not really. - Pretty, eh? - Well, she says she is. Can you keep a secret? I won't tell. You will tell. Wait. Stop. Don't go. - I... - You like Matsuo? - How'd you know? - Easy. It's obvious. What do you think? It'll work. Sure? Don't tell anybody. - Not even Yoshida. - I won't tell Yoshida. - Or her. - I won't. - Never. Really. - You're too much. Don't tell. Hiroyuki! Did you do the shopping? Thank you. - I forgot mustard. - You did? - I'll get it later. - All right. You opened the bar already? That man's here. The one who sings "A Sparrow Never Leaves"? This is from him. I don't need that. No thanks. - Take it. - I really don't need it. - Go to the bar and thank him. - I will not. - Why? Just say, "Thanks." - I won't. OK. Mom? Are you going to marry again? Marry again? Are you kidding? Marry now? Nu. He's just... cash. Don't worry about it. I made some dumplings. Microwave them. Tell Noriko, too. OK? Ito-kun! Something good happened? What do you want? I asked you if something good happened. Not really. You're riding that bike with a big, happy grin. Yeah? - Whose bike is it? - I borrowed it. - From who? - Never mind. - Who? - Yoshida. Yoshida-kun? It's a funny bike. - Get off. - Careful. - Wait. - I'm going home. - What? - Don't move. Don't move your body. - What are you writing? - Did you get it? Get what? OK, one more time. Don't move. Did you get it? So what? - What? - Got it? Yoshida? I knew you got it. You're sensitive about that name. Get off the bike. You're going home, right? My home's that way. Where's yours? That way. Same way. What's wrong? Give me a ride. - Not all the way. - What's wrong? Stingy. Let's go. Wait. OK, ready. Drive carefully. Whose house is this? - Shut up. - Shut up? Isn't this your house? - Which? - This one. - No. - No? A total stranger's. Didn't I tell you that? Yes, outside. No, I didn't. A stranger's, right? They're away. Overseas, maybe. - Overseas? - Guam, Fiji, maybe Okinawa. Take off your shoes. - Come here. - Don't. What? What's wrong? Big bed, isn't it? Want to sleep with me? Just kidding. Why the hell would I sleep with you? I found something interesting. - Now where is it? - Stop it. Where is it? I can't find it. What are you doing? Here it is! For you. Take it home. A souvenir. What's the matter? I found something even more interesting. Oops, underwear! Yuk! Here it is! Switch it on! Weird, isn't it? Why have you frozen? Weird, isn't it? What are you thinking? Are you crazy? You're early today. Not really. I took some lunch money. That jacket smells. You'd better take it to a dry cleaner's. I'm going to school. You can be late for school. - What? - Read it. A letter? Wait for me while I get ready. "I saw your classified ad. I'm 52. Good-looking company president." "Let me love you. To: Shuji Ito" "Examining Room" - Thank you, doctor. - Mr. Ito. Ms. Aihara, please come in. As I told you, we don't treat homosexuality as a medical problem anymore. He seems to be a good doctor. Why don't you come here for a while? OK? Well, I'm going to work. Go to school. OK? By the way, I fell in love. Just between you and me. He plays soccer. - Look at this guy. - He has a great tan. He was attacked on the bus by a pervert. - Isn't that something? - Absolutely good looking! - No kidding! - Just so good looking. But this part of his face is white. This part... black. Spotty tan? Right. Spotty tan. Which homeroom? I'm not sure. I always see him near classroom 4. Is there a person like that in that class? But, there's a problem. He may have a girlfriend. Everybody says he has. Don't listen to the others. Shouldn't I? But he is good looking. The other day, our eyes locked. He stared at me. What should I do? It's all in your head. I see him every morning. - At the school gate? - I took his picture. I'll show it to you. Wait. Matsuo. Let me read your palm. No thanks. I'm studying palmistry. The Great Kambara is famous. - You've nothing to lose. Trust me. - This is BS. I'm serious. I've been studying it day and night. You'll appreciate it. Trust me. - You can? - Yes, I can. - Which palm? - This one. - They clean? - Yes. Trust me. - Great lines. - I've been told. This line is very long. Bastard! I can't believe you. What happened? What did you do? Are you OK, Rika? What are you doing? - Shut up, Monkey! - Don't call me Monkey. I don't want to deal with you, either. Shut up. She's crying. - Apologize. Now! - Go for it, Kambara! - Don't lose to Monkey girl. - Don't cry. Sandwiches, and... ...apple juice. - Two apple juices. - One more? The line's too long. Buy it for me. I'll pay you back. - Together. - ¥450. Thank you. Thank you. Money, money. You can pay me later. I might forget. I'll pay you back now. Thanks. What's wrong? Did you say anything? Like what? Like... who I like. - Who'd I tell? - Matsuo, for example. That you like her? No. - I saw you talking to her. - We were just talking. - About what? - About what? You told her. - I didn't. - Yes, you did. She's been acting strangely. Everybody else, too. Matsuo always acts strangely. Then why does everybody tell me I lost her? I don't know. - Do you like Matsuo? - Matsuo? - No, I don't. - You said so. I did not. When did I say that? On Sunday. - I did not. - You said she's cute. I don't think she's cute. You said she is. Well, I might've, but... Why don't you go out with her? Go out with her? I don't like her. If you like her, go out with her. I have someone else I like. - Who? Anyone I know? - No, you don't know the person. - How come? - How come? It's no one here. - Another school? - It's not important. - Tell me. - I don't have to. I told you who I like. Tell me. But if... you wouldn't understand. I know. Someone in our class. Who? Kikuchi? Kaneko? Not a girl. I don't mean that. Someone at a different school. You wouldn't understand, so... He's a middle-aged man. That'd make me puke. He's probably all greasy. I don't believe it! - Did you hear about Aihara-san? - I did, I did. Someone saw her leaving a hotel with an older man. - Are you sure? - Yes, it's true. I knew there was something strange about her. Me, too. You thought that too, right? Everybody thought so. Somethings wrong. Wood-winds only. Is it me? Aren't you off key? Yes. You joined recently. Listen to the others more carefully. You miss practices, too. When you can't make it, tell Shimizu. The competition is close, you know. One more time! Everybody! Listen up! Remain seated. I have a very bad announcement to make. We're not participating this year. Are you serious? I know we have been practicing very hard. But we're not really ready. Too many beginners, too. So I decided not to enter. But... listen. We are going to be there. What for? I've been asked to help set up and stage-manage it. We'll get paid. How much? ¥4,000. That's enough, right? ¥4,000. I beg you. The organization has asked us. Don't look at me like that, please. Let's go to the hall together, all right? - Don't worry. - I'll pay you back. - I never used it anyway. - It was my fault. It was stolen. It wasn't your fault. Don't worry. - Morning. - Morning. "Yoshida!" "Climax!" Ito. Don't worry. I don't care. The teacher's coming. Stand up! - How's it going? OK? - It's fine. You have light skin. Smooth skin. Don't you think so? White skin. Like a woman. You've been told that, right? Answer me. - Don't go. - Are you a fag? Kambara, you told us. - Faggot! That's trendy. - Yeah, trendy. He must be popular. You're popular, right'! - You're popular. - You are definitely popular. Look at his nipples. They're getting hard. - Let me see. - Let me see, too. - Stop. - Getting horny? Yes, he's horny. - How about a silicon operation? - Yeah. But, silicon is dangerous. - That's right. - It'd suck. Cut off your dick. You'll be beautiful. Definitely. A she-male! - He'll definitely be better. - I can't wait. He's checking me out. He might fell in love with you. I'm done for. Ito, ignore him. - Do you love me? - Love him? No way. I'll show you my body. I'll let you see it. Look. Look. Kambara, stop them. What? Don't be so serious. Look at this. - Look. - He's generous. Look! - Stop that. - What? You too? How far have you and Yoshida gone? Who fucks who? Which are you? I'm sure he's the one who gets fucked. - Most likely. - Tell me. That's filthy! Dirty. What's the matter? What? Don't be so serious. We're joking. - What if I've been exposed? - It's contagious. - I can't take it. - Filthy! What? Filthy! If you take them seriously, you'll only lose. Just ignore them. Let's go. They are telling... ...the truth. Then it's OK. I like you more than as a friend. I like you seriously. I see. I am serious. I told you I understood. What do you want me to say? Well... "Thank you"? "I like you, too"? It's not like that. Then what should I do? I'm leaving. Then... ...would you kiss me? Kiss you? Here? I don't want to. - Why not? - Why not... It makes you sick? - Nothing like that. - Then, what? I don't have to explain. Can you kiss me? I don't want to. Answer me. Why can't you? Why? All right, then. Kiss me. Why? What? Why don't you tell me? If you don't like it. I don't meant it. Go ahead. Do whatever you want. We'll be late. Doctor, are you afraid of me? Why? Because... Why? I'm not afraid of you. If I wanted to, I could attack you. Yes, if you wanted to, you could attack me. But I am not attacked that easily. You never know. I don't know, but... if you want to, go ahead and attack me. You're cute. I'm joking. You're funny. Thank you. Am I weird? - Have you had dreams recently? - No. Do you sleep well? Yes. You sure? Do you need more drugs? Let's keep on the same way for a while. I'll give you your regular medicine. Please take them. I thought... I thought when I was raped... Even then... How can I explain it? Even then, I found the human body warm. So... ...the other's warmth, a warmth like that... I don't trust it. When you have sex, you consider your partner. In a way, yes. You have to think about... ...pleasure. You try to induce pleasure. You say "Ahhh" or "Oooh" for the other. Concentrating that way is tiring, no? It's a part of any human relationship, sex is. There's no other way. Isn't there? I won't report this to your father. This conversation. I don't care. Ito-kun! Are you cured? At the clinic, what did you talk about with your doctor? What do you mean? "Ahhh... Oooh" You made funny noises. Don't eavesdrop. I couldn't help it. By the way, in the nurse's office, you were watching me while I was sleeping. You knew that? - Yes. - You've got a dirty mind! About Yoshida-kun, did you tell him you like him? Tell Yoshida? Yes. What did he say? What did he say... Well... boom! Like this. He pushed me away. Why? Because... I hugged him. Suddenly? Not suddenly. He said I could... But... I didn't think you'd be that brave. You didn't think so? But, when I was pushed away... ...I got depressed. I thought about becoming a "Sell Only". A "Sell Only"? Selling my body to middle-aged men, and getting money. Is it profitable? Sort of. Would you say "Ahhh" or "Oooh"? - Yeah, "Ahhh" or "Oooh". - I bet you would. Probably. Say "Ahhh" or "Oooh"? Yeah, "Ahhh" or "Oooh". Excuse me. What time do you have? - 11:52. - Yoshida-kun. Sorry. I missed the bus. - Sorry. - The movie's started. I lost my watch. Are you OK? Yeah. I'm fine. You didn't have to come. I'm fine. - You don't feel well, do you? - No, I'm fine. Sure? How was the movie? We missed the beginning. There were more explosions. Were there? A lot of people die? Think so. Awesome! I've never ridden on a gondola before. Stop it! Wow! All couples. It makes me puke. I'll get some drinks. I was surprised to see that you and Aihara-san are friends. Were you? I'm not saying that Aihara-san is not my type, but she's a little aloof, isn't she? I don't know. She seems to do everything by herself. She gives me that impression anyway. I envy her. You shouldn't judge someone that easily. - I bought four. - I want one with ice cubes. I bought one for you, too, babe. Don't call me babe. I'm not your girlfriend. I always say too much. I don't like being like that. You shouldn't worry so much. I always talk too much. Have you and Yoshida had a fight? No. I wonder why Yoshida-kun is dating me. I don't know. But you make a good couple. Do you think so? Lately, with him, I feel tension or something. Something is not quite right. I don't think boys have that kind of trouble. What are you trying to say? Do you want to break up with Yoshida? Not really. We have some problems. You date the good student because you like her, right? Anything wrong with that? No. Shimizu is smart. She's a good person. Not grumpy like you. I laugh sometimes, too! You should stop saying bad things about people. Don't misunderstand me. I like Shimizu-san very much! What should we do now? Do? What do you want to do? I don't have any particular plan. I wonder where we'll go next... Should we leave you two alone? No. What was that about? What was what about? You... It didn't mean anything. Aihara-san, are you... not like us? You mean, am I a lesbian? Shimizu-san, you're too preoccupied with that stuff. So what's going on between you two? Between us two? - Are you dating Aihara? - I'm dating her today. What do you mean, "today"? We went to a movie today. - Are you making fun of me? - What do you mean? Because... the other day, you... No. I wasn't making fun of you. Then what's going on between you two? Going on? We just went to a movie. You don't care about me anyway. I'm not saying that. It's the same as if you did say it. What's wrong? You two seem to get along. She's not my type. Then why are you dating her? I'm not dating her. I wasn't talking about Aihara. Yoshida, I envy you... Sorry to keep you waiting. Thank you for using the gondola. The gondola is boarding passengers now. Please proceed to the gate. Thank you. Look at this. All the smiles. Definitely summer, right? Well, yeah. Do you want to visit the South? Not really. Do you want to come to my hometown? - There's a beach. - Your hometown? Also, I'll show you my secret fun place. I can tell you where. From my grandmother's, go straight. There is an orange orchard. Then go straight down through it. And to this side. You're lost, aren't you? There's a tiny beach. I used to swim there when I was a kid. You know the feeling after a swim. You're all tired. You're pooped. I always slept in the orchard after swimming. Then, how can I explain it... ...sourness? The sour smell expands. Paaaah. And my body... Toasty, toasty, toasty. - Warm? - Not warm. Toasty, toasty. And the sky and the earth seem to change places. - Topsy-turvy. - Exactly. Topsy-turvy. Turning around. And I feel, "Wow. Wow." Then... I'd go like this in the field. I'd lie down. Then, I'd march. Oops. Wrong combination. I'd march furiously. - Alone? - Yes. But, I felt as though I were flying. Like this. Very hard. - I walked like this. - But you were flying. - Great. - If you lie there, you can fly. Got you. You're home! Surprise. You came home early today. - Have you eaten? - Yes, with a friend. This... This? - You made it. - What is this? It looks like Niku-jaga. I know what it is. Did your mother come? - Mother? - She did laundry, too. Does she have a spare key? I don't know. She may still be your mother, but I have no business with her any more. Why does she do these things now? I don't know. Do you see your mother? No, I don't. If you want to, you can go to her place. I don't. You know, don't you, because of her debt, how much trouble I have to go through. If you were a real man, you'd understand me. Why Niku-jaga? Hello. Ito residence. Yes. Fine. The usual place? Sure. Yeah, I got it. I'm on my way. What? No, no. Sure. I'm going out. Why is Ito-kun absent today? I don't know. OK. - Have you seen my bag? - No. What kind of a bag? A cloth bag. The one you used for collecting money? - What was it for? - It's best you don't know. Shimizu-san. Have you seen my bag? I haven't. You lost it? - That's why I asked you. - You looked all over? Yes. It shouldn't be lost. But I lost it. How much did you lose? What's the matter? - That's none of your business. - Butt out! You don't know? - I really don't know. - Fine, fine. - What's happened? - Shut up. Have you seen my bag? No, I haven't. Are you sure? What kind of bag? - A cloth bag. - Like a gym bag? No. A different kind. Aihara-san! Have you seen my bag? - Your bag? - Don't pretend to be innocent. What do you mean? I know, I know you wanted money. You stole it. Give it back. Give it to me. Search it yourself. Where else? Did you hide it somewhere? Give it back. Give it back! Where else? I know you stole it. Give it back. - That's enough. - Why did you stop her? - She shouldn't... - Why not? - You, stop. - She might have my bag. I'm checking. Don't do that. Why not? Why did you protect Aihara-san? Oh, I get it. I know, I know. - Do you like Aihara-san? - What are you talking about? - Am I right? - Don't talk nonsense. Anyway, I lost my bag. You stole it. What? What's that? Because... you said we should collect from the other class. I'm sorry. I found my bag. Sorry. Apologize to her properly. You shouldn't put cans in there. What's this? It's for you. I won't tell. Don't scare me. Sorry. Is something wrong with Yoshida? Why? Nothing's wrong. I just asked. Since when did you smoke? Me? When was it... Maybe 15. - Can I have one? - Do you smoke? I never smoke. You shouldn't start. - Just a puff. Can I? - Are you OK? I told you. Are you OK? Are you OK? No way should girls smoke. Don't worry. I'm just hopeless. Why? I'm hopeless. Don't worry about it. Listen. I've been thinking about this for a while. In mangas, people breathe on their fists before they strike. Why? Why? Don't ask me that. I've just been wondering. It's been keeping me awake on nights. You don't have to try to make jokes. I like you the way you are. - Thanks. - For what? Look. Look over there. Where? - It's like an earthquake. - Right. Great. - Three, two, one... - We're too early. Three, two... What? Keep it. I don't want to. I don't need your money. That's it. Hey, wait. I gave it to you. - Fuck this. - Keep it. - No. - Keep it. Do you like Ito? Are you dense? Ito-kun likes you. I can't fall in love with men like he does. What do you mean? Unlike him, I'm normal. What's that shit? What are you doing? Are you OK? Why are you... Summer vacation starts tomorrow. Aihara-san isn't feeling well. She's been absent for 3 days. She's starting vacation a bit early. I hope she'll come back healthy in September. Don't worry. Before I give you your report cards. This... Matsuo-san. Isn't this yours? Remain seated. There was about ¥60,000 inside. Mr. Kawasaki, the Student Affairs Teacher, wants to know what this is for. Please go to the teacher's lounge later. I'll pass out the report cards now. I don't like that sound. Aoyama-kun. Abiko-san. You did great. Ando-kun. Ito-kun. Hello. Ito residence. Aihara? Where are you? In your hometown? Who? Yoshida? No, nobody said anything. What happened? No reason. I can't go to the concert. I feel guilty. That's all. I'll call you later. Bye. Yeah. Later. Hey, kid! Lunchtime. Wait for me, Noriko. Been a while since we've been here. - True. Mom, fireworks! - Right! Give me the flowers. I'm glad you came. No seniors showed up. Thanks. Let's go. Put this around your arm. Yoshida! Long time, no see. - You still playing with a band. - Yeah. - Is your band competing? - No. This year we're just helping. - You go to No.3 High, right? - You're at No.3? - Really? - Do you know a girl named Aihara? No, I don't think so. I heard she was transferred to your school. - What about her? - She was raped. - That's only a rumor. - No, it's true. Police came to our school. You really didn't know? Two students were expelled. - Really? - Seriously. I didn't hear that. What are you doing? We've got to go. See you later. Has anyone gone to get the next band? I don't know. Where is Yoshida-kun? - I'll go get the next band. - Thank you. 5 minutes until you're on. Please go backstage. - OK. - Thank you. You know. What? Where Aihara is? Yes, I do. Where is she? Why do you ask? Do you want to see her? What will you do when you see her? What will you do when you see her? Forget it. Why don't you just say you want to see her? If you want to, come with me. Where are you going? Ito! What are you doing? Wait for me! What's this place? Can't you tell? Do you really know where Aihara is? You don't trust me? Look for her by yourself, then. Why did you come here? - I... - Why did you come here? Let me talk. Talk, then. I want to apologize for the other night. Then apologize. I'm sorry. That's fine. If you've finished, you'd better go home. There aren't that many trains here. I'm truly sorry. The train's that way. Turn right at the comer. I'm sorry for everything. Stop following me. Sorry. I see. I understand. I'm truly sorry. Stop pretending to be kind. What did you think you were doing? Are you enjoying this? Why did you act like a meddling old lady? I didn't. Then why? Yoshida... Yoshida what? Yoshida... I wanted to see how Yoshida falls in love. Why are skirts so floppy? Ask the guy who invented them. All right. Aihara! I... I like you. Why do you like me? There's no reason why. Would you still like me if I were a man? What the hell are you talking about? Answer me. Would you like me if I were a man? I might like you, but it would be a different kind of feeling. How different? I seriously like you. Not as a friend. I love you. Ito-kun likes you seriously, too. He's a man. So what? Is being a man bad? I can't sleep with a man. How about with a woman? Yes, I can. With me? Yes. Even if I were a man? This is nonsense. Yoshida-kun. You don't like me. You like me because I am a woman. You were born a woman. You just want to fuck. No! No. I like you. Why the hell are you wearing that? What the fuck are you doing? What is this? Stop it. Are you two making fun of me? - That's unfair. - Ito! You only think about yourself. What do you mean? You're not fair. You only say you want to say... because... you're unfair. I... I don't know what to do. Aihara, I... Go ahead. Do what? Do it. Do whatever you want to do. Do what? Ito-kun is going to drown! He could die! Ito. Hey! Ito. Ito. Ito. Ito. See. You can do it.
