AND LOOK, I'M SORRY I LIED TO YOU GUYS, BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU... TO LOOK AT ME LIKE I WAS SOME KIND OF FREAK OR SOMETHING. THE POINT IS ALL THE ANIMALS CAME TO ME AND THEY REALLY DON'T WANNA BE SOLD. THEY LOVE DURANGO AS MUCH AS WE DO. AND THE WAY I SEE IT, THEY CAN TELL US EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO WIN. [ Snaps Fingers ] DO YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK. WHAT THE HECK? I'M IN. IF IT'S GONNA HELP JUD OUT, I'M WITH YOU, GIRL. TIME TO COWBOY UP, EVERYBODY!

OUT OF ALL THE TIME WE SPENT TOGETHER AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE SAID TO ONE ANOTHER, YOU WAIT UNTIL NOW TO TELL ME THAT YOU CAN TALK TO ANIMALS. LOOK, BACK HOME I WAS CONSIDERED A WEIRDO, AND THAT'S WHY MY MOM SENT ME HERE, SO I COULD MAKE A FRESH START. IT MAY HAVE TAKEN ME A LITTLE LONGER THAN IT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BUT-- HEY, WAIT.
