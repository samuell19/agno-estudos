Give me the combination. -Go to hell. -What did you say to me? -I said go to hell. -Do you think I'm kidding? Grab his hand. -Tony, not his. His. -J.p.? Hold on now. What the fuck? J.p. Quit kidding. Let go of me. Don't. No! -This is what happens to hold outs. Aaaaaugh! What the fuck! -Now Evan, what's the combination. -Ah ... -Tony, grab her hand. -No, no wait a second. Let me think. 0-3-14-19-83. -Troy. 0-3-14-19-83. -Nothing wrong with your other hand is there? -No. -Hey, that's somebody's birthday. -Happy birthday big brother. -Tony, get me the combination. -No. J.p., no! Stop it Evan! Evan! Tell him the combination! -Evan? -No it's mine! -Jp, wait! 0-9-28-19-55. Try 0-9-28-19-55. -Who's birthday is that? Yours? -My mother's. -Yeehaw, getty up cowboy. Watch them. -How'd you know I'd put the money in the safe? -You're a creature of habit, just like father. -Cops! -Who tripped the alarm? -She did it. -J.p., I can get you out of here. -How? -The basement. -There's nothing down there. We can hide upstairs. -I got you your money. I can get you out of this house. -Duluth police. Open up. Duluth police. Open up! -J.p.? What's wrong? -I told you not to touch her. You hit her? -J.p. Hold on now. Hold on. -Did you hit her? -Yes. -Her boots are on the road. Jp listen to me. -When'd you find the tunnel? -I didn't, the maid did. -The maid? -Cleaning the basement. -Why'd she tell you and not me? It's my house. -I don't believe you just said that. -Believe it. -The maid told me something else. Your mother was having an affair with Jonathan Klaus. You're adopted. -You're lying! Now I know you're related. Only family fights like that. -You have your money. Now let US go. -How much was daddy worth? Five, ten, fifty million? Makes my fifty grand seem like a drop in the ocean. -Fifty? -Oh Vicki, your brother here was planning to turn on you. He'd tell the insurance company it was forty, and pocket the other ten. Old scam, very effective. -Evan? You double-crossing ... -Without me you wouldn't have gotten in the house. -J.p., you're a businessman so let's talk business. Driving cross-country is going to be very hazardous. They'll be looking for you. But borglund is trucks. There's hundreds of miles of wilderness north of here. -You gonna get me a truck? -A speedboat. I know where one is. -I know a cop. I'll tell him you're heading back to williston when you're really heading up north. -Who's the cop? -A friend. Duluth police. -The speedboat is in a Marina south of downtown. -Shut up. -I know this cop. He'll help me. -She leaves, she's never coming back. -I got you your money. And I got US out of that house. Let me call this cop. -Don't do it, she'll screw both of US. Aiiiigh! -You have the habit of talking out of turn. How 'bout I dig a tunnel out back and put you in it? -No, no. -Then shut up. -All I need is a phone. -No need. I'll drive you. -Last night at approximately 11pm central standard time, the borglund residence was robbed. At this time the whereabouts of Evan borglund is ... -All right, all right. Tell me something we don't know. -We can surmise j.P. Was involved in the murder of Troy berg. -We can further surmise, neither j.P. Nor Troy knew the location of the safe, or its combination; Evan had to be present during the robbery and quite possibly the murder. Then there's the tunnel. It's safe to assume only three people knew of its existence: Evan, Sonja, and Victoria schaffer. -Schaffer? -Her mother was Melinda schaffer, Arthur borglund's ... Secretary. -Due to Victoria schaffer's familiarity with the residence and with the deceased Troy berg, I believe she was present at the robbery as well as the murder. Captain? I think Victoria schaffer murdered Arthur borglund. -Yes and Jimmy hoffa's buried under city hall. -Idiot. -Bit of a stretch don't you think? -No way. How do you come up with that? -Rennie. I know you're in charge of that investigation but we have a cold-blooded killer loose in the city. Find him first. -Yes sir. -Anything else? Then get to it. -You are way off base about Victoria. -Smoke? -What are you going to do with Evan? -You're new to this business. I've been doing it a long time. I don't need Evan. I got you. And here's how I got you. You used the tunnel didn't you? That's how you killed daddy. -You hated your father so bad you could taste it. Scraping by all those years. Scratching for every dollar and meanwhile your brother, that selfish shit, gets everything handed to him on a silver platter. All motorbikes and party life. And as it turns out, he's not even a borglund. That seem fair to you? No you did it. You waited until he turned out the light and fell asleep. Then you changed. You used a tire iron to pop the door. I saw the marks on the frame. You snuck through the tunnel, into the basement, and ever so quietly, slowly, made your way up the stairs, and into his bedroom. You watched him sleep: His chest rising and falling. You picked up his pillow and then pushed it in his face. After, you drove home and said good night. Perfect alibi. You killed daddy. I don't need your brother. I got you. And if I ever need to talk to the d.A., I'll tell them what I know. Plea my way down to a year or two. But you? You'll get life. You got a good head for this business Vicki. What do you say you come work for me, and we make some real money? -You ready for tonight's stake out Leroy? -As ready as I'll ever be. -We'll catch you two later. Come on big guy. -Mark. -Ya rennie? -You're grounded. -What? -You're staying here to work on your list. -Why? Because I don't believe Victoria killed her father? -No it's because you're in love with her. Work on your list. -No! -I'm impressed, vickie. You were smart to ditch your boots. That way they can't connect you to his murder. -No! -To make sure you're here, when I come back. -Aiiigh! No! Goddammit! -Victoria. -Oh Mark. -Who's out there? -Jp. Jp and some other guy. -Are you sure you know where you're going? -I should. It's my property. -You're parents, grandparents, where are they from? I'm ojibwa. I'm also a police officer. Drop your weapon and put your hands up. You're under arrest Mr. Patrowski. -There he is Mark! -Freeze! Duluth police! -Shoot him! -Rennie. Oh god! Rennie! -No Mark, Mark no. I'll stay. You go. Go get help. Go! -So that job you offered me, how much does it pay, daddy? ♪ Today Victoria schaffer will appear in a St. Louis county courtroom for her arraignment in the Arthur borglund murder case.
