I told you I was Clay's friend and I wanna be your friend, too - Come on, let's talk about this - White ass education ain't gonna talk here. - You're making a mistake. - I can see we got us a little problem here. Just what are we gonna do with his white ass? Look, just let me go and we'll forget this happened. You ain't goin' nowhere. Hold it, baby. Let me show that dipshit a thing or two. Oh shit, man. Let me git him. I am gonna rip your ass open, honky. Cut him and the pigs'll come down on us hard, baby. You gonna remember your little visit to our home, here. The pigs show us real good how to work somebody over and not leave no marks for no evidence. That was for my brother and this is ... Don't move anybody! You know me Washington.

These bastards were gonna kick - the hell outta ya. - No, it was not that way. Makimba and I, we're friends. Turn around, Washington. Are you telling me this nigger sonofabitch and you are friends? - That's right. - That right, you and he friends? I'm talking to you, boy. Is he your friend or not? He says so. We all know white folks don't lie. Bullshit! You button your black ass. Show a little respect. You two got something going but you sure as hell aren't friends. Must be a nigger lover. They never learn. Ah, he's chickenshit, plain and simple. Either way, it's his funeral. All right, you black bastards, put your arms down and turn around. Now hear this real good. Next time we catch you at anything, you eggs together at anything, we start pulling triggers. You got that? Now, get your black asses outta here. Black cats cross our path, it's bad luck ... for the cats. One word of advice buddy, nobody makes a fool outta me. Come back to this jungle again, don't expect any help from us. Stupid! Have you seen Nancy since you've been back? - No. - What's wrong? Oh, nothin'. Just my parents have been givin' me kind of a hard time. You know, I mean about college. Well, you two did have sort of an understanding, didn't you? Yeah, it's just that, I don't know, I don't, I just don't like being pressured. I like to take my time, get used to things. Nancy understands. I wrote her that last week I was in the hospital. - What's her old man gonna say? - After he reads what the stock market did, he'll probably say 'goody, goody" Who the hell cares what he says? He always liked you, didn't he? Yeah, he thought I'd be a great son-in-law. He'd sure be a great father-in- law. Be like havin' that great Father in the sky. Streets lined in gold, everything you wanted. The only thing is Al, you gotta die to get there. Our asshole buddy, Washington. Smart asses. - How 'bout him? - We want Washington. Check the alley. Sonofabitch. Hit him! - There he is. Now how the hell - did he get up there? - That dumb sonofabitch, hit him Shit! Assume the position, asshole. Get 'em up. I ain't runnin' from you pigs no more. You had your fun, now split. - He's clean. - Cuff the bastard. - What's the bust for? - We've got some unfinished - business, boy. - What business? Just the little matter of you kickin' the shit out of a white - man. - The star witness is my friend. Yeah, but we are not your friend. That's right, Makimba. Over there. - You got nothin' on me. - No, nothing that will hold up - under a stupid judge. - Arresting you is just - paperwork. Waste of paperwork. - You see it works like this. We get paid by the citizens to keep the peace. Right, Berry? Right on, soul brother. You are a citizen and we're gonna get to keep the peace. Get it, Makimba? Fuck you. That's no way to talk to It. Stans, boy. Our boy's gonna apologize now, aren't you boy? - Aren't you, boy? - Yeah. I'm sorry. Fuck you both. Fuckin' pigs! Damn, forgot the cuffs. Dammit, they never learn. Those sons of bitches.

You're never gonna learn, are ya? - I'm sorry about that john? - Oh, don't worry about him. There's plenty more where he came from.

Cut that out. I don't need that. It'll help. Believe me. Stay down, baby. Look, you got to learn to live with whitey, baby. Why'd they - beat you this time? - I was talkin' to some honky. - Two pigs came out on us. - Stans and Berry? Yeah. But you know that damn guy wouldn't press charges. Said he's my friend. Lotta good it done me. You can't fight the man, baby. If he wants you, he's gonna get - you. - Where are my things? You don't want me because I've been with white men. Look, what you do is your business. But I don't want no part of fuckin' whitey's chick. Shit man, that's got nothin' to do with me and you. We ain't been together for a long time. From now on, we're gonna do everything together, just like we used to. Just you and me. It don't matter about nobody else. Stop bitch. Don't you understand nothin'? I ain't fuckin' - whitey's whore. - Please, don't do this to me I've got bills. I know what I am, but please. - Let's go to our place. - You mean our no-tell motel? Yeah, but you won't have to stop this time. Jim, I still feel the same about you. I love you. I knew before the first time I was sure. I still am. I love you, too. It's just that, I don't know, I'm kind of mixed up. Seems like since Vietnam, everything's different. I'm not different and you aren't either, not really. I know it was tough on you, getting shot and all. Getting shot was easy. I was just standin' there, talking. Jim, do you still want to get married? I still love you. Only I'm not sure marriage is the answer. If you gotta have reassurance Nancy, I, I can't give it to you No reassurance needed. I bought some of that beer you asked for. Let me have one. - You get a hold of the brothers? - Well, I passed the word on the street. Listen, we gotta talk. - What about? - Well, I saw my man on the street today. He wants to talk to ya. - So. - I asked him to wait outside in the hall, so you and me can discuss how we gonna pay the -rent. - Oh, I get it. You mean your - pimp's right outside, right? - He's right outside the door. Hey, Willie. You wanna talk? Open the damn door. Good morning, brethren. It ain't nice to keep people waitin' in - the hallway. - Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna beer? No. Makimba, right? You see Makimba, Tina here's one of my best girls. But she ain't been turnin' in no bread lately. I got nothin' against my girls havin' a little fun on the side. But we got to have an understandin'. - Is this the way you want it? -I ain't sayin' nothin', baby. - I just want to work things out - Look at it this way, brother. I could use another man out there in the streets. You been ripped up by that honky, beat up by his pigs. Now you know where it's at. We just gettin' a little of ours - back, that's all. - I get mine my way. What might that way be, brother? Them pigs come down on me again, they gonna be dead. Ah, don't be stupid, man. You fight the man, you wind up with - shit. Now that's Willie's law. - At least I won't be no pimp for whitey. And you won't be no whore neither. Now you best git your ass outta here. You interferin' with my business boy. Makimba, you have such a hard head. I don't want you to go, but I've got to pay the rent. And Willie here has been good to me. Baby, don't you know you're sellin' more than your ass? You're sellin' your soul, don't you understand that? Talk is cheap, nigger. If you such a hard man, why don't you just go on, on out there and git them pigs that's been after ya? - Maybe that's what I'll do. - Well, right down the street is a shop. They got lotsa guns. All kind. You just mention Willie. - They fix you up real good. - You both crazy. What you talkin' about getting guns and killing people? Willie, you stop pushin' and leave us alone for a day or two and let us both make up our own minds. Well, your wrong Tina. Not in a thousand years. Not for you, not for him, not for nobody, white or black. Wait, I do what you want, Makimba. Don't go. It's been a pleasure makin' your acquaintance, brother. Hey, you wanna pull the trigger? Go ahead pimp. You got one shot comin' and then I take it and shove it up your ass. Now you just leave now, boy. Your friends are waitin' for you Tina, I'll never forget how you been to me. But you goin' back to this pimp or some other for sure, soon as - the rent's due. - Still talkin', nigger. Now you look cute. See Mother, I told you he'd straighten up. I guess I know See Mother, I told you he'd straighten up. I guess I know - my own son huh, Jim? - Sure, Dad. It's gonna be a great day today for you. I just know it is. Look at him. He goes out with Nancy just one night, today he's up at the crack of dawn to see about enrolling in school. - How's that for progress? - Oh, It's late. I've gotta rush Good luck, son. Will you be able to uh, register for next term, dear. - I guess so. - I'm sure Mr. Dorian will - help ya. - I won't need his help. - How were Mr. and Mrs. Dorian? - Fine, I guess. - Well, didn't you see them? - No but uh, I will. Tonight, and I'll ask them how they were. I mean, how they are. Where's my clip? My bullets, where are they? - Where you get that gun? - I ask you one more time, old man. Now, where'd you put my clip with those bullets? I know nothin' about no bullets and no gun. You lie. You're a lyin' old bastard of a Tom. You crazy, boy. You gone plum outta your head. Why you got no rights to lay hands on me. I'm your father. You're no father of mine. Now, where's my goddamn bullets? You're gettin' badder and badder boy. But you got no reason to hate that white boy who done brought that letter from Clay. I'm sorry you got beat up by the police, but you got to - learn. - I learn. Nobody beats me and gets away with it no more. I stopped running at that and I start pushin'. Now, get that clip. I been a good man all my life. I tried my best to be a good American. I raised you boys most by myself since your Momma died. Got one boy dead, one boy kill crazy. You been a good American, all right. Whitey's nigger. I ain't - nobody's nigger. - Listen to me, son. There's good and there's bad, both sides. Well, I need those bullets to protect me from those bad pigs. You can't go after no police. They kill you for sure. Maybe, but they won't stomp nobody else in no alley. Gimme that gun Tommy, before it's too late. Tommy, Tommy, you can't. Tommy. Tommy, Tom ... My name Makimba. I ought to beat you old man. I ought to beat your ass good. Tommy. Now, where's the clip? Where? Pop. Pop? Oh, Poppa. I'm sorry, Pop. (sobs) I'll make 'em pay. I'll make 'em pay, Pop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

And as much as it has pleased Almighty God, in His wise providence, to take out of this world the soul of our deceased brother, Thomas Washington, who lost one son in the foreign wars and leaves one son, Thomas Jr. to mourn. We hereby commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes and dust to dust. Looking for the general resurrection in the last day and in the world to come. to be strengthend from a glorious majesty to judge the world, the earth and the sea shall give up their dead. Listen, I don't expect any trouble. But if something does go wrong, you just get the hell outta here, you understand? Jim, I'm frightened. Are you sure you have to do this? Yeah, it's all right. They've all gone now. Besides, there's something I want to give to the old man. - That's your Purple Heart. - Yeah, doesn't mean a damn thing to me. But it might mean something to him. - You didn't even know him. - I knew his son. - Both of them are victims. - Be careful. I will. You don't learn do ya? What the hell are you two guys doing here? - Just doin' our job, friend. - Trying to be a dead hero or something? We told you to stay out of Watts. Yeah and I go where the hell I want and do what I want. Hey you, you. I pick my own friends. Look over there. They're your friends aren't they? Why don't you take your pretty girl over there and introduce her to you friends. They dig white girls. Plenty of room over there under the tree. Lieutenant and I won't bother you at all, we'll just stand here and watch. Let me tell you guys something. That old man being buried over there died never having a chance to live. I think his people deserve better than being hassled by you two sick bastards That's one nigger lover that's gonna get himself killed. That sonofabitch is in with the pigs. I don't think so. He'd of turned us in before now if he was. No man, he was lookin' to catch Makimba alone. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of him. Hey man, he'll wipe your tiny ass in a minute. Size isn't everything. I've got four inches. That sonofabitch is in with them - I say you're wrong. - And I say he's right. You got eyes, ain't ya? He was just with them. That don't prove nothin'. I'm gonna get that bastard. I'm gonna give that bastard some of what his friends gave me. Want you do me a favor. Don't walk back up to Watts no more. So hang around Sunset Strip around whitey's joints. - He'll show up. - Right on, brother. - Ah, Cancer. That's you. - Aquarius. That's the one that says I'm a humanitarian. - Uh, huh. - Visit beautiful downtown Vietnam. You should do that. - Hey, now that I like. Here. - That. Look it's art, don't laugh. Oh, look happiness, peace and love throughout the world. Well, I'll buy the peace. Can I help you with something? Hey Jim, surprised that you're here. I see you kept your date. - Well, how about your date? - What date? Uh, yeah uh, Nancy this is Bobbi. Her, I mean, you know. - We're engaged, sorta. - Sort of. What does that mean? Um, we are only uh, not official - Well, best of luck. - Uh, how long you had your job - here uh, Bobbi? - Uh, I got it two days after I met you that night. That makes it about a month. Hey, I'm going to a party tonight. You want to come along? You can bring ... Nancy. We'll have a ball. - Maybe. - Nice meeting you, Bobbi. There he is. I knew we'd find him. Just like Makimba said. Hold tight. It's too crowded around here. Let's go inside this head shop and see if we can find out who he is. I'll bet you're wondering about her. She's why you didn't make that first date, right? Right. Look, I just didn't want to get as involved as we were before. But I'm glad we did, Nancy. I mean that. This last month's meant more to me than, well, than any day. I can just see things clearer through you somehow. I know we always planned on gettin' married. But I don't think marriage is the answer now. Nancy, I love you. Live with me. I don't want to live together because of some paper the state makes us sign, that says it's ok. I want to live together because I love you. I love you too, Jim. But what would our parents say? To hell with our parents. They haven't done such a damn good job runnin' this world. I'm not gonna let them run our lives. I want to but there's so much to think about. Give me some time. I'm gonna rent that apartment you and I looked at over near campus. I want you to live there with me. I don't know Jim, my parents. I'll see you at the beach tomorrow at 3:00. - Yeah. - Well, we found that honky - Jim, man. - Bring him here then. Can't do it. Can't get to him down here. It's too crowded. Oh, we talked to a chick over the head shop. Seems he's going - to a party tomorrow. - Where? I got the address. She even invited us, see'in as how she think we all are such good friends. Hey man, look, I ain't goin' to no honky party. We all goin'. We gotta teach that bastard a lesson. I'm gonna kick his ass just like his pig friends gave it to me. - Hi, sorry I was late. - That's all right. - Have you been waiting long? - No just a few minutes. I've thought about it, Jim. I want to live with you, I do. - But I don't know ... - Then come live with me. It's so difficult. You know I want to live with you, but my parents, especially my father, he'd die. Crap on your father, Nancy. Come on, don't cop out. You just - don't want to bad enough. - But Jim, he doesn't understand - at all. - His side or mine? Oh Jim, it's no choice. You're the one I'll be with the rest of - my life, not my father. - I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna rent that apartment near campus. And I'm gonna hope that you live there with me. What'll I say to them? How will I convince them? Look Nancy, you're over the age of reason. You don't have to convince anybody of anything except yourself. Nancy, very few people get a chance at happiness in their life. When it comes, grab it, hang on to it. God, I wish it were that simple. I'm sorry Jim, I just can't. Then that's you decision. There's nothin' I can do about it. But don't expect me to wallow in your self made misery. Maybe he ain't comin'. Like I told your friends, he said he might be here. - Who might be here? - Jim. Just some dude I was seeing. He was in Vietnam with Makimba's brother. You know, I think you blacks look just so masculine. Kelly throws the most interesting soirees, doesn't - she? - Yeah, but uh, who are all - black people around here? - I don't know, but they should be at all the parties. - Whoo. Hey, baby. - Whoo. How about you and I get a couple of chicks in here. Vroom. Oh, somebody peed on my grass. Somebody peed on my grass. - Suck on this, baby. - Oh mama, I wuv ew. Waa, waa, -waa. I wuv ew, mama. - Hey Tarzan, how about another one of those crazy, flipped out jumps. Yeah, come on man. Let's see you do one of them crazy, flipped out things. Hey, let's all do that crazy, wild, flipped out somethin' whatchamacallit. Hey, you wanna do that crazy, flipped out thing with me, baby? Hey baby, that's cool. You don't want me to flip out with your old lady. That's, that's cool. Cool it, baby. Little fella's just about bite-size. - Oh. - Well, when the war comes, I hope you're on my side. - Well, the little fella. - Yeah, he is a little fella. Ah, little fella wants to integrate. Anybody want him? - Well, I like vaniller. - He looks pretty cute to me. - Eh, there's nothin' better. - Look at all these foxes.

Get your hands off of me, honky. Or would you rather lose it? No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone ... Is he anti-semitic or - something? - Well,if he is, we's all in trouble. - Let's go for a swim. - Nobody brung a suit. That doesn't matter. Whoa, like the lady said, 'black is bigger.' Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly. - Oh, Mr. Adams, how nice to ... - Don't give me any of your 'nices' I've been watching for over an hour and it's disgusting Who are all these people, negroids and everything? Well I, I'm terribly sorry. We'll keep the noise down. And all the nakedness. Another one of your disgusting parties. Well, this time I've called the police. Mom is due home any minute and she mustn't see this. Come on man, pig's on the way. Let's git outta here. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. What's happening? Uh, somebody called the police. Christ, do you know where Bobbi is? Bobbi? I think she's back there some ... listen, is your name -Jim? - Yeah. Uh, there's a black fellow looking for ya. His name is uh, - Makomba, Magomba, I .. - That son of a ... What's the idea of followin' me? - You gotta debt to pay, honky. - What debt? All I did was pay - my respects to an old man. - Fuck you. I know you put the finger on me and I got the shit kicked outta me for it. What the hell you talkin' about? You sayin' you don't know nothin' about them pigs stompin' - Makimba? - Honest to God, I don't. You're lyin'. You're a lyin' honky prick. Listen asshole, you don't know what you're talkin' about and you're the prick. Now, if you want to do somethin' about it, - let's do it. - That's ok by me. Come on, honky. Get up, you rat bastard. Get him out of here. He's the one. He's not even class. Get this prick right out of here. Take him away. He's causing nothing but trouble in the neighborhood. I'll get you honky. I'll get your fuckin' ass good. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Shut up, you black sonofabitch. (yelling and struggling) You're trash, get that shit right out of here. Get him outta here. He's destroying this neighborhood. I believe you, man. But he figures you fingered him to the cops. You best watch yourself, ok? Where's Bobbi? I don't want any of that stuff. It's bad for you. Whatever happened to that square friend of yours? - Nancy? - Yeah. Nothin'. I don't see you for two months, then every night for a week. - You two lovers have a fight? - Kinda. - What about? - Nothin'. - Oh, that's cool, fight about nothin'. What's the matter? Don't you want to talk about it? What are you, some kinda goddamn doctor with all these questions? You know, I really don't find you very amusing. I tell you, I don't find you a barrel of laughs either. So let's shut up and amuse each other. Nancy. Making love to a guy who doesn't even know who I am is too much. Hey, you know I know who you are. You better quit hitting that stuff so hard. It's going to kill you. Look, why don't you just call her. Why don't you just shut up, you dumb bitch? What do you know? I know I'm not a dumb bitch. I may not have had the breaks to have parents like yours but at least I make it on my own. Make it on your own. The only thing you're good for is "makin' it". But, I got to admit, you're pretty good - at that. - Practice makes perfect. Dumb bitch. - Hello. - Hello Nancy, this is Jim. - Oh, hello Jim. - Listen, I'm at the motel. - Why don't you come on over? - I don't know. - Uh, just to talk. - Maybe. Goodbye, Jim. I have to shower. Hi. Hi. Hey, I'm gonna take a shower. You wanna join me? Sure you don't wanna shower? I feel kinda sweaty. - You've been drinking. - A little. Jim, I don't want to go on this way. We have a fight, cause I can't live with you. All right, won't live with you. I don't hear from you for over a week. Then I get a call in the middle of the night. I don't want to talk about it now. That's ok, there's nothing to talk about. I'm leaving. No, wait. I mean I know it's hard on you and all with your parents. But, you can't live your life for them. We've already gone over this, Jim. I'm sorry. - Nancy, let's get married. - You're drunk. No, I mean it. I mean we talked about it for a long time. You won't live together with me in sin, we'll get married. - We'll do it tonight. - I don't think it's anything to - joke about, Jim. - Dammit, I'm not jokin'. I mean it, I mean let's just once do something we want to do. - To hell with anybody else. - But that wouldn't be fair to our parents. They're expecting a big wedding. It's not for me but they've been so good to me. Couldn't we have just a small one, huh? - Hi. - Hi. - Hey, can we talk? - I'm busy. - Just for a second. - Ok. - Hey, I'll meet you at Fred's. - Ok. - Sorry about that fight. - Oh, that's all right. It was kind of stupid anyway. Well, where have you been for the last - couple of weeks? - Hey listen, let's go somewhere I can't. I told him I'd meet him. Maybe I can see you - tomorrow. - You're not going to believe this. I'm supposed to get married tomorrow. That's cool. So I guess you're busy tomorrow? What do you mean you're supposed to? I'm not sure I'm gonna go through with it. You will. Your parents know about it, right? - Right. - You'll go through with it. It'd take guts not to. Hey, brother. Heard you were back out on the streets. Yeah, a month in the can's a long time. Never again. Nobody's ever gonna beat me again. I'm never goin' back there again. Been watchin' that honky Jim like I told ya? He disappeared man. Nobody knows where. What about his old lady, the one at the party? Get his old lady and bring her over here, right now. - What you got in mind, brother? - I got a lot in mind and I had a month to think about it. That honky caused everything and he's - gonna pay for everything. - Right on, brother. Now you get the brothers over here, right away. I told you to get that bitch. I told Father Cholackain I'd meet him inside, so ... - Oh, good morning, Father. - Good morning, Jim. - Mr. Webster. - Father. - Beautiful day today, Jim. - Yes, it is. I'm tellin' you man, that cat didn't finger you to the pigs. I seen you at that party. Man, you so hung up on that white ass you don't know where your head is. His head's in that white ass, man. Shit man, ass is ass. White, yellow, black or green. Right on. Woo hoo. Wowwee. Knock that shit off. We got plans to make. Now if you too chicken, you got no place with us. Maybe you want to tell your white brother what we got - planned for him. - I already done that. You told him what I'm going to do to his white ass? I just told him to watch out. You already know that. - You told him. - And what did you tell him? - I just told him to watch out. - You got no right saying - nothin' to nobody. - He's tryin' to be our friend. Hey man, fuck that. Since when do we got white friends? - Morin' brothers. - Hey man, what's happenin'? - What's happenin' here? - I called a meetin', man. We're gonna pick up the honky's chick. Who you talkin' about man? Pickin' up who? His old lady. The one at the party. We gonna have a little fun with her. And then she's gonna tell - us where pretty boy is. - You still hung up on gettin' that dude? Man, you're crazy. That cat didn't finger you to the pigs. I won't have nothin' - to do with it. - Dammit, this is one big chickenshit nigger if I ever saw one. Hold it! Now you've taken a lot on yourself, all of a sudden. Now you got a hard-on for this bastard, that's your business. But how come we're doin' your business for ya? I'm makin' it my own business. I promised my father I'd stop runnin'. You're wrong in this Makimba. He's gonna get all our asses in a sling. And I'm tellin' you all, it's wrong. Now, I ain't - havin' nothin' to do with it. - He's right. You're wrong man. I ain't leavin', but I ain't gonna help you with this. Then you just stay out of the way. Anybody else? We don't need the others, just you and me. Quiet, in an alley. You realize marriage is a sacred service that dates back to early man. Even the pagans had their marriage rights. Our society today is almost wholly based on marriage. It is the most sacred service of the church. A person should not enter into marriage lightly, Jim. And because of the importance of this service, I wanted to have this little talk with you. Are you sure you want to go through with this? You look pretty good. You want to change your luck? Look, I, I've got somethin' to tell you guys but you got to understand, I got nothin' to do with it, nothin'. You get me? Yeah, yeah, we get it. Go ahead boy, we're listening. Makimba's gonna kill the white guy you caught us with. I told the dumb shit he'd get his ass in trouble. Look man, that's not all. They're gonna kidnap his - girlfriend. - White girl? Yeah. - Ha, ha, ha. - You guys have no right to - treat me like this. - Where is he? I don't know, he's no friend of mine. - Where is he? My God, if you know anything, please tell 'em. The only thing I know is that he said he's getting married today. Where? The Glass Chapel. - This better be the truth. - What do you black bastards think you're doing to that white girl? Nobody'll blame me. - There's one more honky left. - What the hell. We gotta get out of town and fast. To hell with him. Don't you understand me? We just killed two cops. You're right. But the bastard that caused all this ain't gonna live for his wedding night. Dearly beloved, we are here assembled in the presence of the Lord, to unite this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Which estate, instituted by the Lord from the beginning, and being of divine appointment is honorable among all men. It is therefore, not by any to be entered in ...
