Here, come up the aisle a bit, Jim. I can't lift this by myself. Check that gauge. Yeah. I'll wing it. - Careful up there. - Yeah. Getting nothing on this thing here, but there we go. Just turn that there. Good. Hey, slow down your walk. - Bring it up. Easy... - Let it go. Here, I've got it saved. Shot contest down in the lounge. You in? Sorry, boys. I've got a date with a hot shower and a good book. How'd you like a good man instead, huh? As tempting as that sounds, Speedy, I think I'll take a rain-check. - It's Eric. - Oh, hey, come on in. Oh, damn, you clean up nice. Now, what did I tell you about that when I got you this job, huh? You keep goin' around looking and smelling like that you're never gonna pass for a rig jockey. So now, just 'cause I work here now, I gotta stink like you? Okay, now, I stink? Okay, this is some All-American man-funk. Yeah, it's funky all right. So, what's up? You ready for primetime, yet? Hardly. I just got an e-mail from my boss. Apparently, when I said, "leave of absence," he heard I quit. So I had to give my office to someone else. Okay, look, you know what, don't even worry about that. Where would WNYP be without their star reporter? - You mean its Queen of Fluff. - Well, I think your Fluff's great. Like my breaking news piece on the opening of Iran's first Hooters? Okay, well, you've got to admit. I mean, orange veils, hot pants? I mean, that's a hell of a combination. Wait... Why are you so vicious? Four-thirty-nine and counting. How're we doing? Culture appears stable. Twenty-eight replications. Two more and we are golden. Two more and it's home to mommy. I thought I told you never to call me mommy. Besides, we're never gonna make this deadline. A deadline we were never going to meet in the first place. Not for the kind of money Stark's paying. Hell, those things get to eat more than we do. As soon as they stop, so do we. Once you break this story you're gonna be right up there with Diane Sawyer. What story? I still don't have any concrete proof that Starkcorp's using oil rigs to dump chemical waste. Without it, I might as well sell my piece to the Travel Channel. Oh, don't be like that. Maybe this will help you. What? Just consider me your black Santa. Merry Christmas. - What is this? - This is what happens when the guys on the bridge forget to log off their system. I just grabbed everything I could. Performance analysis, test results... replication data? There must be 50 pages of classified ecology reports here. It's all mixed in with a bunch of weather data. The only constant seems to be something called SERENA. SERENA? Maybe a different rig or an oil spill Starkcorp's trying to cover up? Whatever it is, I bet this guy could tell us. Nathan McCain. His name's all over these documents. Look at all this. So I did all right, then? You did more than all right. I mean, staying an extra week just to get me on this rig. And now, this? Yeah, I owe you, again. Okay, look. You don't owe me anything. You just gotta break this story and keep this on the DL or it's my ass. I mean, Samara's seven months pregnant. I lose this job, she'll kill me. You're gonna make a great dad. Yeah, well, we'll see about that, huh? I'm gonna go grab a beer down in the lounge, so... hey, don't work too hard, okay? Always. - What are you down to? - Hey, it's good. - Hey, give me a hot sauce. - You love talking. What's going on, guys? Get ready to have your money get taken, your wives, your food. - Bring it on. Set 'em up. - Let's do it. Why? What do we got today? We've got a problem. Thirty-one replications. - What? - And they're not stopping. That's impossible. Purge it and shut down the entire system. Now! It's eating through the containment wall. Wait, where are you going? We have to make sure the lab is sealed off! You go right ahead, I'm getting the hell... - Give me my money. - Yes. Give it now. Oh, my god. Hold on. Go! Let's get out of here! Go! There's a fire! My knees! Yo, time to get out! Help me, let's get out! Help me! - Get out now. - Get out! - What's happening? - Fires broke out on level four! The whole rig's going up like a dead Christmas tree! Come on! - Go! - Get out! Get on the boat! Get out and on! Get on! Dr. Thornton to Emergency. Dr. Thornton to Emergency, please. Excuse me, can you tell me what hospital this is? Hi, hon. How you feeling? You're in St. Alvin's Hospital. You were brought in this morning with some others from the oil rig. You said there are others. My friend, he was on the rig with me. Can you check? Sure. What's his name? Eric. Eric Lambert. Okay. I'm sorry. Thank you. Out of 284, only 14 are survivors. As for the spill, Mr. Stark it appears to be under control at the moment. Good. Clean-up efforts. Between clean-up efforts and the loss of the rig itself including an estimated 26,000 barrels of crude we're looking at a net loss... we're looking at a net loss of approximately 14 million. Anybody hungry? Anybody? No? I can wait. Mr. Stark? A Ms. Chang is on Line Three. No calls. All right, what about the status of SERENA? Nine strains were being stored in the lab only one of which was active and in a highly unstable capacity at that. Most likely, all of the strains would have been destroyed in the accident. Then you tell me how in the hell something like this could've happened? Well, sir, the safety record aboard the Aeolus isn't exactly what you would call impeccable. - I know that Krieger. - Of course, sir. But perhaps if we had... Sir, I have a call from Robert Trenton from Fidelity. Dammit, Candace, Mr. Stark clearly said no calls! Stuff it, Krieger! Put Mr. Stark on. It's for you, sir. Tell Trenton I'll do the conference call in two hours. Now, you're gonna tell me what we can salvage out of this mess. By all accounts, the Aeolus trials were successful. We're on the verge of increasing the speed of the disassemblers tenfold as you requested. It's simply a matter of refocusing our efforts. Well, you better get crackin'. Because our investors like Trenton are gonna want to know what I've been spending their money on for the past two years. Only good thing about the Pentagon pulling out their funds is that they've been off my ass. Sir, if I may? Thank you. I think we need to start thinking preemptively in the name of damage control. You see, it's only a matter of time before the media ties Starkcorp to that rig and comes looking for a statement. So, I've taken the liberty of picking out a tie which I think is appropriate for the occasion. Now, to me, this grey one says "I feel your pain, but let's move on together." - Burn that thing, boy. - Yes, sir. We do need a cover story. Something to get the wolves off our trail. Something or somebody to blame this thing on. Well, if it was one of our wells in the Middle East I'd say we could take the terrorist angle, but... on the Northern Slope, that's not really an option. Why the hell not? Well, because the idea of an Al Qaeda terrorist running around somewhere in the Arctic is a little hard to swallow. Well, I don't really care what you can swallow. You gotta start thinking outside the box. Eco-terrorist. Big Bird to Nest, I'm approaching the coastline. Negative on thermal. I'm reading pretty cold from up here. Better go ahead and take some pictures for us, anyway. Yeah, well, maybe I'll get lucky and catch some topless sunbathing Eskimo babes. Nest, we're gonna have to call this one on account of weather. Roger that, Big bird. Engine one is out. It's like something's controlling me. Big Bird to Nest! Mayday! Turning now to a story we've been following since early this morning the devastating collapse of the oil rig Aeolus off the north Alaskan coast. We go live to correspondent Michael Burke. WGBC has just learned that A-Pex LLC the company which owned and operated Aeolus is, in fact, a subsidiary of fuel giant Starkcorp International. Meanwhile, the death toll has risen to 234 in what some are already calling the worst oil-related disaster since the Exxon-Valdez one that Starkcorp CEO Roy Stark has told the public he firmly believes is the result of industrial sabotage. Would you give him some room, please? Thank you. The eco-terrorists responsible for this despicable act of cowardice will be hunted down and brought to justice. Here at Starkcorp, our goal continues to be to develop safe, efficient cost-effective fuel alternatives for the 21st century. Now, I hope you'll all join me in remembering the crew of the Aeolus... and keep their families in your thoughts and prayers. Thank you. - Mr. Stark? - No questions, please. - No, that's enough. - Which eco-terrorists... What are you hiding? Morning, partner! It's almost 5.00. And we're not partners. I asked for someone who at least a working knowledge of meteorology. They send me you. Somebody certainly woke up on the wrong side of the cold front. What you really need is a pick-me-up. Here, have some. - Oh, get that thing away from me. - You know, I still don't understand what you have against Big Moe's Burgers. You never tried one. Do you know how unhealthy that stuff is for you? It's on a whole wheat bun, man. You really need to start livin' a little. Yeah, and you need to show up on time for once, Terry. You know, why don't you come with me to The Beaver Trap Gentleman's Club. Better yet, they make house calls. No offense, Terry, but I've got Britney to keep me company. You're a regular sadomasochist, man. First, you ask to be stationed out here in the ass-end of Alaska thus depriving yourself of the two greatest things left about this country Fruit Loops and G-strings. And then you insist on naming every single one of these weather systems after a woman. You know what you need? You need a real woman that can blow up to 45 miles an hour if you get my wind-drift. What's this? Send a message to the boys in Seattle. Tell 'em to bundle up. Britney's gonna get a push from this cold front coming out of the Yukon. Touch down in Vancouver, 120. It's gonna freeze 'em in about four or five hours. What do you care, man? They're Canadians. And look at this, something hitched a ride on her back. It's coming down hard and fast. - Where? - Right here. About 200 miles north of us. Come here, please. - This... - What now? Let's get inside! Please, here! - Something... - That way. - Inside! - They're gonna hurt. - Come in! - Get inside! Get inside now! Come on! - Where are they from? - I can't do it! Please work, come on. Yes. Gotcha. Miss, what are you doing? This computer is for hospital staff only. - All right. - Where are you going? Miss, please. Where are you going? Don't. You haven't been discharged. Who's she? It's one of the Aeolus survivors. Her name's Katherine Stern. She's a reporter. Or she was until three weeks ago. And as you can tell by these photos, she's small-time. She's really attractive, if you ask me. - Keep it in your pants, boy. - Yes, sir. What's she doing on my rig? Yes, apparently, she was brought on after the last rotation. She was brought on by an Eric Lambert. Yes, over here. He led a protest against our Kelvin Thomas oil processing plant last year while he was working for us. And nobody fired the son of a bitch? Apparently, no. He was on the list to get fired after the next rotation. Well, let's put him on the list after this rotation. You don't have to. He's missing, presumed dead. I think we might have just found our eco-terrorists. - Do we have any proof of that? - Get her on the plane to me. Me and Ms. Stern need to have a little talk. Take that! Why don't you leave your ex-wife alone? Not till I wipe that alimony smile off her face. Look at this thing. This is unlike any other storm system I've ever seen in my life. It jumps in Britney's path out of nowhere, disrupts her flow forces her to make landfall and turns her from a basic storm-front into something resembling a Class 3 monsoon in a matter of minutes. Let's just call it a day, you know? Terry, you were five hours late today. Now, you wanna leave early? What you got? A hot date? You bet your little Doppler, I do, Spice Channel Ginger Lynn Marathon. All Ginger, all the time. Yeah, go ahead. Go home, Terry. I'm gonna stay here, look through the rest of these documents. There's gotta be something I missed. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna cut the coffee pot off on my way out. Oh, and we're all out of Skittles. Thank you, Terry. Sir, Ms. Stern left... - Whoa, take a breath, boy. - Thank you, sir. Ms. Stern left St. Alvin's hospital hours ago. Where'd she go? A taxi driver thinks he took her to the train station. Well, we'll just have somebody waiting on her when she gets there. All-righty. You call up the media and tell them we're ready to identify our perpetrator. What the... Well, the formation must've originated somewhere over the Chukchi. Now, the signature AWIPS is picking up indicates it's gone from meso to synoptic yet it remains totally non-deciduous. In English, Doc. For those of us who don't speak Weather Channel. Well, this thing may look like a storm cloud but it does not act like one. So what are you saying? That I've gotta tell all of Alaska just to be on the lookout for some funky cloud? No, what I'm saying is that whatever this thing's up to I have a feeling that the hailstorm was just the beginning. Look, Doc. I'm a big golfer. And when I retire in a few years I'm gonna spend every day I got coming to me playing. And in my experience, when a weatherman has a feeling I don't cancel my tee-time, Doc. I just bring along an umbrella. Colonel, you don't understand. This thing is a complete anomaly. It's totally unpredictable... So, you don't know what the hell it is. That's correct. Well, what in the hell is Uncle Sam payin' you for, son? You were a day late and a dollar short yesterday. It cost me a good man and a plane because of it. I'm aware of that, sir and that is why I think that it's very imperative... Well, look, thanks for the call, okay, Doc? And be sure to get back to us with the weekend weather forecast. The train leaving for Anchorage, 1024, Track Number 6. Anchorage, 1024, Track 6. Hey, what's going on? And now, we go live to Seattle, where, just moments ago Starkcorp CEO Roy Stark addressed the media. Whether Ms. Stern harbors a grudge against Starkcorp or against the achievements of corporate America in general the point is she has no qualms about carrying out her agenda no matter who it harms. And that makes her a very dangerous woman. Officials are now seeking this woman, Katherine Stern a former WNYP reporter who is thought to be one of the eco-terrorists accused of being responsible for yesterday's oil rig disaster. The train for Fairbanks, 1204, Track 7. At 1204, Track 7. Come here, baby. They don't know where she is. They don't know what she knows. You just can't get good help these days. Unless Anchorage was her destination all along. In which case... In which case? Oh, right. Well, in which case, she may be attempting to seek some answers from one of our former associates now residing in Palmer. - Nathan McCain? - Yeah? Katherine Stern. I need to talk to you about SERENA. Did Terry send you? Listen, I respect your line of work, but I have no money. Cut the crap, Doctor. I need to know everything you know about SERENA. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know who or what you're talking about. Really. Not according to Starkcorp International. Well, that's quite a story. But I still don't understand why you're telling it to me instead of the police. You wanna see what I've got or not? The floor is yours. How did you get these documents? So, you recognize them. I asked you how you got these. And I ask you. What is SERENA? These are my calculations, and these are my theories. And they've been completely appropriated. It's cannibalized to the point I hardly recognize my own work. I have no idea what this is. Well, that makes two of us. All right, well, let's start with the obvious. How would your work wind up in the mainframe system aboard a Starkcorp-owned oil rig in the middle of the Chukchi Sea? Well, I did some consulting for them two years ago. They said they needed my help in developing new ways of reducing environmental impurification. It's okay, you can say oil spills. I won't be offended. They threw a bunch of hypotheticals at me. I crunched the numbers. I came up with this. Okay, so they knew what they wanted. They just didn't know if it was feasible. And they had you do the heavy lifting. But what's the end result? Well, my understanding was that it was being, in part, funded by the military until they pulled the plug. The military? Okay, but what were they funding? I don't know. If you had to take a guess? - I don't guess. - Try. Well, they were interested in it because it was a biological anti-pollutant maybe something to stop oil spills. Of course, I'm sure a military application would be far more insidious, especially if... Oh, my god. If it's airborne... - If what is? - This, right here. Whatever this is right here, they were keeping it on that rig. It was released into the atmosphere during the accident. Say hello to SERENA. Is this fun or what, huh, boys? Hey, I tell you what. As soon as I'm finished with this, we'll get ourselves a fire going. Cook up some eggs and hash browns? What do you think of that? And then, once it gets a little dark I'll tell you guys some scary stories. - When do I get a turn? - When I lose. But you never lose. Then I guess you'll never get a turn. And in the morning, we're gonna go fishing. So if you're saying this thing rises and falls according to the sun's heat then at least we'll get a breather in another 10 hours or so? No, it's probably going to be too late by then. This thing's clearly been making up for lost time. Since Sunday, we've been tracking these three major storm fronts, okay all poised to merge right here in Seattle. It's an area with a notoriously unstable marine climate. Throw our cloud and its amazing saturation capacity into that mix who knows what's gonna happen? You took my advice. Good man! Katherine, this is Terry Nash, my assistant. Terry Nash, this is Katherine Stern. I know who you are. You're the terrorist chick all over the news. You're a terrorist? Actually, my official title is eco-terrorist. - What? - Okay, which part of "They're framing me and I need your help" wasn't clear? No, I don't know, how about the part where you forgot to mention I'd be aiding and abetting a fugitive? You have the right to remain silent. Anything stupid you say can be definitely used against you in an effort to get lucky with this chick. I'm beginning to think that coming here was a big mistake. - Yeah, no kidding! - I'll you what. I'm gonna go wait behind the wall and just listen just a little bit. I thought maybe you'd care. Maybe you'd want to get to the bottom of all this. Look, lady, I just met you, okay? You don't know a damn thing about me. Oh, really. Well, let's see. I know you're single. I know you've never lived anywhere longer than 18 months except for the two years you worked for the Air Force. You don't even own a car. Your parents died in an automobile accident when you were... 12. And according to Starkcorp... you're responsible for the cloud. - They can't do this. - No, but they did. Welcome to the wonderful world of unscrupulous corporate tactics. Now, what are you doing? Look, we're in the same boat here, whether you want to admit it or not. And the way I see it, we've got two options. We can stand around here and bitch about it to each other all day or we can take this to somebody who can help us do something about it. So what do you say? Hey, you guys, you expecting company? 'Cause two MIB's just pulled up out front. Those are the guys who were waiting for me at the train station. We gotta go. - Where? - Anywhere that's not here. Keys! Thank you. I owe you one. Okay. You pay for the gas and don't change any stations on the dial. You dump everything on that computer. - Take the stairs. - Follow me. Well, hey, there, fellas. I'm sorry to disappoint you but I'm not buying any magazines today, you know? Where is she? I've been asking myself the same question my entire life. - There's a problem. - What? I don't drive a stick. Hey, fella, I'm Terry Nash. Folks call me... Terry Nash. Where are my manners? Would you guys like some coffee or something, a bear claw or... No caffeine for you. You're an herbal tea man, right? I got plenty of that, too. I'm gonna have to clean that up. We'll never be able to outrun them in this piece of crap! I'm sorry. Next time, we'll take a luxury getaway car I promise. They're right behind us. Go! Come on! Watch the road! I am! I'm fine. I've done this before! Really? No. - What is that? - It sounds like your cell phone. Don't answer that, it's a stolen phone. You really are a fugitive, aren't you? I'm gonna die. Great. Construction delays. Watch out! Jeez, what's next, a fruit stand? Hang on. A sharp corner up here. Be careful. I've got an idea. All right, get ready. I wasn't ready for the last thing you did. Lamarck Weather Station, Terry speaking. - Hey, it's me. - Me who? - It's me, Nathan. - Prove it. You're a woman-chasing, beer-guzzling buffoon who once accidentally dated a transvestite. Man, you are on a cell phone. Anybody could be listening. Where are you guys? We're somewhere outside of Juneau. We gotta get this disk into the right hands. Hey, listen to me, what's the status on our mystery formation? Wow, there is crazy weather all over the place. A bunch of satellites are down. Listen to me, Terry. I need you to take that Starkcorp information. Yeah. You've been holding out on me, man. Since when did you become an expert on nanotechnology, man? - What do you mean? - I poked around the files. I hope you don't mind. This is pretty complex stuff, boss. - What is it? - SERENA's a nanotech program. Nano-who? Hello? Terry! Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Colonel, we're getting multiple reports of extreme weather conditions, plus, some really strange sightings. Trees buildings, it's like they're just being erased, sir. - I want everyone on full alert. - Yes, sir. Okay, so what you're telling me is this thing, this formation is actually made up of a bunch of little robots that eat things? That's the simple version, yes. I'm guessing that's not a good thing. Not if you put stock in the Gray Goo Theory. The what? The Gray Goo Theory. Some scientists believe that nanotech is nothing more than a Pandora's Box. I mean, that we might one day inadvertently create a single nanomolecule that is capable of multiplying and then eating everything on the planet. Trees, animals, people. So, basically what you're saying is we're dealing with Pac-Man on steroids. Yeah, that's the video arcade version of it, sure. We gotta get out of here! The disk! Hold on! - Katherine! - Yeah? - Are you okay? - No. Come on, we've gotta get cover. What is this stuff? So that's how the weathermen do it, huh? Probably. I'm not a weatherman, though. Sorry. Meteorologist. Actually, I'm a climatological theorist. So basically, a weatherman. It's amazing you can take eight years of graduate training a PhD in mathematics and physics, and condense it to weatherman. So, what exactly does a... - Climatological theorist. - Yeah, that. What sort of stuff of things does the government have you doing? I provide reports that, you know might help in regards to military operations. Look at this. All the more reason why we need to tell our side of the story make sure they nail Stark to the wall for good. I don't care about that. I don't know about you, but I didn't come here for vindication. I came here because I thought I could help people. I lost my best friend on that rig. And not only that, his wife lost her husband and his unborn child lost his father. Exposing Stark's not gonna change any of that. No. But maybe it'll keep it from happening again. Friends of yours? Let's find out. Come on! Excuse me! Hi, I'm Nathan McCain! I'm with Lamarck Meteorological Research Station in Palmer. It's imperative we talk to Colonel Miller. It's a matter of global security. Really? Global security? Dr. McCain, are you telling me that all of this is because of some robo-germ? Well, it's a little more complicated than that, sir. But the language of the documents Ms. Stern has recovered clearly indicates an intent to develop and utilize nano-agents. Nano-agents that are multiplying. They are heading your way right now. It is imperative that you evacuate the state of Washington immediately. Son, I don't know what kind of fantasy world you imagine the US Armed Forces operates in but do you have any idea of the mass hysteria would result if I issued an order of that magnitude? No. But I promise you that people will die if you don't. Sir, I know how this sounds, okay? But you have to believe us. I... Dr. McCain? Dr. McCain, come in. Come in, Dr. McCain. We lost contact. Radar's picking up interference all over the place. Damn it! Oh, god. This is Stark. We have been watching the news with great interest, Mr. Stark. We have concerns regarding the incident in the Chukchi Sea. Everything with SERENA is right on track. I'm assured we'll have damn good samples of both cultures no later than tomorrow. So, how about you and me try to lock down the money? We have discussed this at great length. There is still the matter of the demonstration which you had originally promised to provide. Oh, come on, you've seen this product. You know what she can do. In a lab setting, yes. But the people I represent have a very specific task in mind for SERENA. One that requires that her tenacity and capability first be tested in a natural environment. I'm gonna have to call you back. Mr. Stark, we still need to discuss... Watch it, number one. - What's going on? - Let's determine. Oh, my god. Oh, watch out. Honey! - It's gonna break. - Yeah, it's breaking now. - Tell us, I'm scared right now! - Come on. - Run! - Travis, go! They're gonna break any second. They're gonna break! That glass is gonna... - Run! - Run! Is that it? What is it doing? It looks like it's getting ready to attack. What happened? One of our rotors just gave out! It's melting through the glass. It's in the precipitation. It's used itself to seed the storm cloud. What, on purpose? You gotta be kidding me! These are like little gnats! How could they be that smart? Because they share the same brain. Are you're sayin' this crap can eat through metal, too? I'm saying it can eat through just about anything! Move aside! I can't keep her up much longer! Slam the door! - I hope you know what you're doing! - Not really! I thought you were in the Air Force. You think I know how to fly? What else do they do at the Air Force? Well, I've seen this done a thousand times! It can't be that hard! Just try to keep us level! What do you think I'm trying to do? What? Nathan? Come on, wake up! Nathan! Listen to me, we've got to get out of here. Now! Come on! Are you okay? We're back up and running at about 60% capacity, Colonel. I want to talk to Nathan McCain. Hey, better watch your step. I'll be fine. I just have to... - Calm down, sir. John! - Okay? - Somebody, help. I'm bleeding. - Thanks. Hey. How're you feeling there, ace? Sorry about the bumpy landing. It's actually kind of harder than it looks. Okay. You know what, you got us down. That's all that counts. And you saved my life. Let's call it even. So, it must be kind of frustrating for you being in the middle of the story of the century without a mike or a camera. Not really. I kind of wish there were no story. Listen, I'm gonna see what I can do about getting us a ride outta here. - Yeah, okay. - So... See ya in a minute. - We're here at Seattle City. - We're here at the Command Center where rescue crews are working feverishly... Meanwhile, downtown is devastated. Buildings were on fire. The Space Needle has collapsed and there are reports of hundreds of deaths. Hey, Doctor. There you are! Hey, I found some guys who're taking supplies down to Aberdeen. They said they'd give us a lift. - Okay. - What is that? Something even better than those documents, proof! - Let's go. - Yeah. Nathan McCain and Katherine Stern to see Colonel Miller. We've been expecting you, Doctor. What the hell are you doing? We've been looking for you two. We got caught in the thick of it in Seattle. - Your pilot... - I heard. Katherine Stern, sir. I know who and what you are... - Ms. Stern. - I'm not a terrorist. We found this on her, sir. We are both here to help, sir. Well, this better be good. The Pentagon's looking for answers. We just need access to a microscope. Oh, and if you wouldn't mind? Here's what we're up against. Not especially imposing, I realize. This particular cluster was retrieved from the mouth of a deceased victim. A young woman. Late teens, maybe 20. She had braces on her teeth and traces of burns around her mouth. And these things, they were immobile when you found them? - Yes. - So they can be killed? We believe so. We're not exactly sure how, but we're working on it. Look, are we talking about the release of some kind of weapon of mass destruction or not? We don't think so, General. However, in the wrong hands, they could be utilized as one. Then what the hell are these things doing to the weather? Well, weather is controlled not by the clouds but by the particles within the clouds. And you're saying we can expect more of these superstorms? I'm saying we can expect a single mass that spans the circumference of the entire globe. Meaning activity that'll make the storm that just took out half of Seattle look like a spring shower. A worldwide disaster. So, can you help? Maybe, but we need to get to the bottom of whoever created this. Well, if we're talking about getting some concrete answers then I think it's time we see somebody who can supply them. Mr. Stark, there are people here to see you. Do I look like I want to see anybody? Sir, it's a Colonel Miller from Whittendale Air Force Base. He wants to meet with you regarding SERENA. Well, you just tell him I left the building. I'm afraid it's too late for that. Let me ask you something. You think I'm gonna go down alone? Oh, no. Of course not, sir. We burn together, boy. Mr. Stark. Thanks for agreeing to meet with us. Oh, glad to have you. Anything you need, just say the word. I am surprised to see Ms. Stern here. I figured you'd have a date with the FBI. Maybe you should just pretend I'm not here. Wishful thinking. What would a pretty girl like you want to stir up all this trouble for? I'm not the one conducting dangerous Nano experiments on an oil rig. Nah, I don't have any idea what you're talking about but I do know you're directly connected with the sabotage on my rig. And whose idea was that? Ms. Stern, we're here to gather information, not make accusations. Why, thank you, Colonel. I was hoping I'd have the opportunity to speak directly with the research team working on the project. Well, I'm a hands-on kind of guy. Interesting office you have here. It's no secret that my company has been on the cutting edge of Nano Research for quite a while. Of course, the US government pulled their funding two years ago. So we've created a little maintenance program to keep the research alive in case the government would like to come back onboard. Dr. Van Owen? Please, watch carefully. Nothing up my sleeve. This particular strain are speed-assemblers. Interesting. What else do they do? Just keep your eyes on the flower. When the program ended, we were able to produce nano-specimens. It looks like there's more of 'em now than there was before. They're self-replicating. Nifty, huh? That's where they get their name. SERENA. Self-Replicating Nanomolecular Agent. So, what were you experimenting with on the Aeolus Oil Rig? Experimenting? The Aeolus was merely used for storage because of its location and cold environment. And what were you storing on Aeolus? Disassemblers. I was afraid you were gonna say that. You were storing nano-materials on an Arctic oil rig? Yes, because it was approved by the US government, the Department of Defense. And SERENA was there quite happily for two years until you came along. Nanoparticles are solar-reliant. They have the ability to store a small amount of energy. But without a consistent source, they're useless. What better place to store the material than an Arctic rig? The average temperature is less than 15 degrees below zero and there is less than five months of sun a year. Well, what confuses me, gentlemen is how the agents were able to stay active in the Arctic. And I hate to put the spotlight on the little lady, but again... I assure you I had nothing to do with it. - We're looking into it. - Good. Because the program was shut down over two years ago by the United States government so I would assume that no further research was done. You assumed correctly, sir. Good. Then I would also assume that as soon as you have some answers you'll get back in touch with us immediately. Oh, you bet. In fact, we'll send you some samples for your research personnel. Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot to do today. Certainly. We are hearing that the devastation captured earlier today is the worst and most bizarre storm system to hit the Pacific Northwest in over 100 years. Destruction has so far claimed countless lives and left thousands of others homeless. All shelters are currently full. The Governor has asked that the Federal government declare a state of emergency. Government officials are combining efforts to explain the devastating storm that hit Seattle and is now moving south-southeast. For the latest updates, stay tuned to this station. Roy, what are you doing? Housecleaning. I hope we're not burying ourselves any deeper. I mean, it is not unreasonable to say that we had the right to continue limited research under the maintenance mandate. I don't want to talk about that right now. Anything else? No. They contain a sample of each culture. The case has a self-destruct mechanism in the event the integrity of the samples is compromised. Okay. This is the self-destruct code that both activates and deactivates it. - Got it. - You realize that in the event of a purge if the self-destruct has been activated, it cannot be stopped. You also realize that it could be activated from distances up to three hundred miles using a twelve hundred megahertz radio transmission. Kirk, I got it. Roy, are you sure you don't need my help on this? We have numerous teams qualified to deliver this to the United States military without you doing it personally. Yeah, you know, accountability is a lost art. I'm gonna do this myself. The material in this form is still highly dangerous. I would certainly feel more comfortable if a security team were to accompany you in... There's a warm front coming out of Mexico forcing it further inland. At which point, it'll most likely hitch a ride on the jet stream across North America. And there's no stopping it. The Pentagon gave us the go ahead to begin air strikes using air gas explosives. With any luck at all we'll be able to tear this thing apart before it knows what hit it. - Colonel, I'm not sure that... - Look, I'm not sure about anything anymore either, but what alternative do we have? I don't know about you, but I don't see a damn thing up here. Roger that. Pea soup. What the... Are you seein' this? Yeah, I see it, but I don't believe it. Sir, this is Eagle 1 to base we have visual confirmation of the target. Engage at will, Lieutenant. Roger that. Direct hit! She's has to be coming apart! You got to be kidding me... It destroyed him, sir. We have a plane down. Repeat, plane down! We dropped our entire load on this thing! Negative response. I repeat, negative response. Bring it on home, Lieutenant. Yes, Mr. Stark? The situation has changed. I'm gonna need payment and asylum. You are requesting political asylum in the Republic of China? I am requesting secure residence exempt from United States law. I understand the situation you now find yourself in, Mr. Stark. However, my government is still concerned that without a proper test... If your government wants to know what this thing can do tell 'em to turn on the news. Uncontrolled chaos is not useful to us. I can control it. We will expect proof of that before we finalize our transaction. - Of course. - Good day, Mr. Stark. General, I think it's time that we prepared ourselves for the distinct possibility that the Titan Four is our only solution. What? Titan as in Titan missile? This thing has taken everything we've thrown at it. Wait a minute. You're actually considering firing a nuclear missile at this thing? Yes! We're not talkin' about rubber bands and paper clips. Well, neither are we. Well, in case you two haven't noticed we're running a little low on options! Well, that doesn't mean you need to try to erase one mistake by making an even bigger one. Well, it's all we've got at the moment. And if you two come up with something better why in the hell don't you just let me know? What about casualties? Minimal, if we act quickly. But in a few hours, that storm will be right over LA and then we're talking about putting 11 million people within the blast radius of a nuclear bomb. I am sorry, Mr. President but I cannot give you any better alternatives. Mind if I join you? Sure. It's getting kinda stuffy in there. Hey, are you okay? I was thinking about my friend, Eric. I'd almost forgotten about him in the middle of all this. He wasn't supposed to be on the rig last week. It was supposed to be his week off. But he was trying to help me become a real reporter. I'm so sorry, Katherine. I mean, if it was me and I know I can't exactly put myself in your shoes exactly. But if I was trying to figure this all out I mean, I'd probably start by asking myself what I was doing on that rig in the first place. I was trying to find a story that mattered. For once, I wanted to do something that made a difference. Well, in that case, I'd say you're doing pretty well. Well, what do you want me to do? I mean, you can't just leave. Boy, are you still trying to tell me what I can and can't do. - Of course not, sir. - CYOA. - CYOA? - Cover Your Own Ass. Sir, they're gonna come looking for you. What do you want me to say? You're a bright boy. You'll think of something. But, sir... Oh, Lord. Shoot. What is it? That girl that... You said there were burns in her mouth where you found the particles. Is it possible she was struck by lightning? I don't know. Maybe. Why? An EMP? An Electro-Magnetic Pulse. Yeah, I know what it means, son. I can't believe I didn't think of this before. The nano-particles, they're like micro-computers. What does an EMP do to a micro-computer? Erases it. Destroys it. Yes, and lightning has the ability to create a natural EM pulse. The girl that you found must've been struck by an air-to-ground current while these things were attacking her. Her braces acting like a conductor, the lightning struck created a pulse, and it kills the particles. Just where do you propose to find an aircraft capable of delivering an EMP device? I mean, the moment it launches the thing its own electronics will also be destroyed. It's a suicide mission. Some of us are willing to take that chance, General. No. No! You can't do this! General, firing a nuclear weapon at this thing is a bad idea. Okay, the radiation disbursement of a detonated warhead is not gonna be accurate enough to kill this thing. It's like trying to take out a swarm of bees with a shotgun. We do not have an alternative plan. You understand? Well, listen to me! All we have to do is pull the particles into a concentrated mass. In my business, it's called cloud-seeding. It is the same general principle as your idea. Except that thousands of people won't die of radiation fallout before we know whether it works or not. An EMP detonation will work! You just have to give us enough time to find a way to deliver it. Time is the one thing we no longer have. But we do have Icarus. She's the only thing we've got that's impervious to EMP. That was nearly 20 years ago, Colonel. She's been sitting in a hangar ever since. They've kept her air-worthy. At 1400 hours. If Icarus is not ready by 1400 hours we launch. And that's the best I can do. Close it. - It's big! - Yeah, it's nice. She's made out of composite paper material. - Paper? - Icarus. Made of paper and plastic. It was considered a first-strike weapon. We had to classify it black ops. The program had to be buried, but not enough to be scrapped. But it had to be put on ice. Like Stark's Nano program? Sort of. How long is it gonna take to get her up in the air? The plane's already being prepped. I've got an EMP being flown in from our base in Helena. And we're supposed to do this on zero sleep with a skeleton crew in 90 minutes? Seventy-eight minutes and counting. Piece of cake. Physical systems, clear. Colonel Miller. Where's my EMP device? ETA, ten minutes. - They're doing the best they can. - That's just not good enough! Colonel. Look, I just need five more minutes. We can't do it. We have our orders. Damn it, I know this can work, if you'll just give me... I'm sorry, Tom. Get back with that plane and have them put the damn pedal to the metal, you understand me? Yes, sir. I'm gonna get this bird in the air if it's the last thing I do. General, we've locked in on the target's signature and are prepared to begin missile launch cycle on your mark. My fellow Americans. As I am sure you are all aware, our planet has been besieged by a series of strange weather phenomena over the last 36 hours. Initially, these incidents were deemed unrelated and isolated. But recent information has come to light indicating that these super-storms are being caused by a cloud of highly destructive biochemical matter. Currently, the cloud is being tracked off the California coastline where it appears to be moving inland. Along the way, the weather on the coast will be disrupted. Even more damage may occur when it hits landfall within the next 45 minutes. Now, there is no need to panic. A dedicated group of men and women are working in the target areas around Los Angeles to prepare for the storm. To that end and based upon intelligence supplied by a number of officials I have authorized an immediate plan of action. At 2.00pm, Eastern Standard Time we will launch an attack at the cloud. We believe this will successfully neutralize the particles knocking it off course and rendering it harmless. Commence launch sequence. Yet, whatever occurs, we will be prepared for it. And we will survive it. As a nation and as individuals. May God bless us all. They're ready for you, Ma'am. All right. - All systems operational. - Let's go catch us a cloud. We are scheduled to land in Beijing in 12 hours and 45 minutes as long as we don't have any weather issues. What is it, Mr. Stark? I'll be in Beijing at 9.30 am, your time. And you have it? Yeah, of course, I've got the sample thing but you're not going to get the control until I'm comfortable with my arrangements. Are we clear on that? - Of course. - Good. - Oh, great. - What are you doing? You have no authority to be in Mr. Stark's office, Van Owen. - What are you looking for? - Nothing. Maybe evidence that could implicate you in an investigation, Krieger? I don't know what the hell you're talking about. So where is he? A meeting. His entire empire is in collapse, and he's in a meeting? I don't think so. Where are the samples he was to give to Colonel Miller? I don't know. You have no authority to go in there. This is all the authority I need. - Where's he going with the samples? - I don't know! Do you realize what will happen if he sells those samples to someone other than the US government? I don't know! I don't know anything. Do you understand? You and I are going to go to jail for a very long time unless we find Stark and those samples. Do you understand? General. It's Colonel Miller from Whittendale Air Force Base. He says the Icarus is airborne. So, how many times have you flown this thing? Personally? None. My last combat mission was Desert Storm. Fantastic. All right! He's on his company jet on the way to Beijing. - Who's with him? - No one. He's meeting some Chinese officials when he lands. Federal Agents, Mr. Stark! Put your hands in the air! I can't get a lock on the cloud. The interference from the nano-particles is getting worse. You're supposed to be my eyes, Doc. You gotta help me out here. Hang on. I'm gonna try something. Whatever you're gonna do, you better do it fast. - Damn it. - Talk to me, Doc. We better hurry. The cloud's headed inland. And it looks like it's picked up a few hitch-hikers along the way. Coordinates! Where is she? Coming right up! It just passed over Big Sur. We should be right on top of it. My god. Don't shoot! I'll tell you everything you want to know. Hang on! We're going in. We've only got a few minutes before the cloud coordinates an attack and we're all history. Let's do this! Arm the device! If somebody had ever told me the words "Arm the device" were gonna come out of somebody's mouth aimed at me... Oh, god. I only touched what you told me to, I swear! It's not you. It's them. I think we've made it angry. We're approaching Santa Monica. Another ten minutes and we'll be over downtown Los Angeles. That can't be good. Prepare to deploy the device on my mark. We need the coordinates on the missile now. - Give it to me fast. - We need it now. Five. Four. Three. Two. Now! - What happened? - They must've eaten through the hull compromised the deployment mechanisms! Not eat, it's disassemble! Whatever the case is, it's not working. The Titan missile is still closing! Is there any other way to detonate the EMP bomb? Colonel, two minutes until we enter LA airspace! Now, we are the bomb! Sir, missile warhead separation in three minutes. This is Sinclaire. Tell the President the missile is on target and will continue unless I receive an authorized abort command. Guys, it looks like we've got company. Oh, god. Katherine. You've got to focus. You can do this. - What do I do? - Make sure she's still armed. - We're still armed! - Good. See the yellow lever on your right side? - Yeah. - On three, pull it. One. Two. Pull! You next, McCain! I'll be right behind! What is our present distance from Los Angeles at detonation? - Less than 80 miles, sir. - No. That's inside safe distance! I know, sir. Disassemble this. - Abort! - Abort! Let's go. Help me. - Katherine! - Hey, Nathan! Save me! - Save me. - Are you okay? Yeah, are you okay? Looks like rain. Looks like snow. Is it over? It's over. In the wake of CEO Roy Stark's death in an airplane accident the assets of fuel giant Starkcorp International were seized today, as were the files of Dr. Kirk Van Owen Starkcorp's Chief Scientist in charge of Research and Development. Van Owen and Executive Officer John Krieger were discovered shot last week in an apparent shoot out with each other in the executive offices of this very building. This bizarre fall from grace follows news that the EPA and federal government intend to review the operational records of Starkcorp in connection with the recent weather phenomena. And finally, I would like to make a special mention that Air Force Colonel Thomas R. Miller was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his courageous sacrifice in the ending of this ecological crisis. This is Katherine Stern reporting. Man, she is a total hottie. Yep. I never said that she wasn't. What is that you're eating right there? It's green. Is it Brussels sprouts? Oh, yeah. I mean, I have a whole new lease on life, man. No more burgers, no more booze. I mean, you get a pine tree up the ass it really changes your perspective on life. - Good for you, Terry. - Absolutely. - Knock-knock. - Hey. Had to see if you were feeling better. Oh, yeah, my sponge bath fantasy come true. And I see that you are. They have nurses for that kind of thing. Did you see the nurse on this ward? She looks like Jabba the Hutt in a white uniform. Well, if you're getting a sponge bath from Jabba the Hutt - we're gonna go for a walk. - Sure. Hey, there's no need to leave on my part. I feel very comfortable with my naked self. Where you going? Come on back! I hear her coming! She's got real big hands. Please come on back! So, when do you start your WNYP prime-time anchor gig? What, and give up stripping? Well, if you're ever in this neck of the woods again we should go grab a meal or something. I mean, you eat. Often, yes. You know, I don't actually start 'til next week. So do you wanna maybe? Go get something to eat now? - Yeah? - Sure. - Do you wanna walk or drive? - Well, let's see. You crashed the car, I crashed the helicopter. I think we should probably walk. Good. I've always wanted to go out with a weatherman. Climatological theorist. Translator: IYUNO
