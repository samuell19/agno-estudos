[birds chirping] [wind whistling] [leaves rustling] [mellow music playing] [vehicle approaching] -[horn beeps] -[bicycle bell rings] [brakes screech] [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [indistinct chatter] [horse whinnies] [gates creak] [snoring] [snorts] [children chattering] [man] Here we are. [horse whinnies] Hmm. [horse whinnies] -Good morning! -[woman] Morning, Zemba. [boys gasp] [boy 1] Look, she's the new one. What's he carrying? [boy 2] Gramophone, stupid. -[boy 1] It can't be. -[boy 2] Yes, it is. [man] Mayor. [man whistles] Very nice. -[people exclaim] -[gigging] [indistinct chatter] It's early in the morning. We only have the odd locals out. But in the evening... [water sloshing] [mellow music playing] Do you recognize it, Doctor? Hmm? [Doctor] White Roses. It all sounds beautiful. [boy] Cool. What big melons. -[woman screams] -[boys giggling] Oh, you dirty little devils. -Get out! -[man] Those boys are out of control! [whispering] What are you looking at? Andrija, show us your hook. What hook? ... says that you've invented a hook which can pull people out of the water all on its own. I know he's lying. I'm not lying. And I'll break your neck! [boys clamoring] [Andrija] Just stop! Wait. Just stop. Easy now. Just stop. There it is. I told you. Ah-ha! Is it a magic hook? A magic hook. Pretend this is a drowning man. Mmm. Of course, a drowning man is thrashing away. [laughter] Right? You mustn't let him get his hands on you. -[boy] Why not? If you're on a boat, he'll overturn. If you're in the water, he'll drag you down. But not, if you pull him out using my magic hook, he can't harm you. [boy 2] Does it hurt him? Drop it over his chest, you pull tight and ... [boys exclaim] Out he comes like a fish. [boy 3] Can you catch the catfish with that? Someone's drowning over at Zemba's! Let's go! [people clamoring] [man] Andrija! [indistinct chatter] Andrija! [boys] Zemba! Zemba! Zemba! [dog whining] [door shuts] Hello! -[man] Hello. -[woman] Hello, Andrija. [bird calling] [crickets chirping] [dog whines] [water rippling] It's important. Her husband was one of our best people. The Germans mustn't find out who she is, or they'll kill her. Put them on the beach. Oh, I don't know. That's dangerous. It's too close to the bridge. [chuckles] That's right. They'll never look there. All right. Don't worry. I'll be around. [water splashing] Thanks. Do you hear that? Hmm? [dog whining] Oh, my God, it's moving. [rumbling] [whispers] Martin. Martin. Martin! [man yells] Martin! Martin! -Martin! -Yo. I saw it. I saw it. It's very angry. There's something bad going to happen. -Uh-huh. Did you try to catch it? -No. Why not? Oh, because I was afraid. It usually doesn't move this time of year. We're the same, us, you know? You'll never catch that fish. I'll end up doing nothing at all. And then, people will ask me, "Well, Andrija, what did... What did you do with your life?" What am I supposed to say? "Well, I just stood waiting for someone to drown." No, no, every career has its shortcomings. I mean, you can't be a doctor unless somebody is sick and you can't be a gravedigger unless somebody dies. That's true. -True. -It's true. I can't fix this. Look. -It's impossible. -[clattering] Ah-ha! I see the mayor's entertaining the crowds again. And you're coming down ... whose boat is that? Whose boat is it? Oh, that was, uh, a woman and her child. -What, dead? -No, no. -They're here. -Who are they? [whispers] They're here. They're hiding from the Germans. What are you going to do? I don't know. I guess I just have to let them go on their way in the morning. What, in this? You can't let them go in this. It's completely rotten. ... get the lamp. Come on. [bird calling] [whispering] Now, I just want them to stay at the beach for a couple of days. All right? I mean, until they can get their strength back. -Oh-- -[shushing] This is Andrija. The kindest man on the river. Ah. -[animal howls] -[dog whines] Better take your hand out of the water, son. [boy whispers] I'm not your son. [shushing] You see, these are the fairy waters. Nobody knows how far they go. Even I've never been to the end. See, it's dangerous here. It's easy to get lost. And there's big catfish in these waters that's bigger than a boat. [woman humming] A fisherman, he was drowned yesterday. But if the water devil accepts your sacrifice, then he'll let you have the body back. [wind whistling] [indistinct chatter] [chatter continues] [canoeing sound] [mellow music playing] ...I've got this... this salmon. It's really much nicer during the day. Uh, now, I just... Sorry, I have to ... I'll take this. [pots clattering] Here, now, you don't want the smell of that cheese. Although, if you're hungry in the night, ... I leave it right there. I'll take... I'll take all this. And... And I'll... And I'll get you... This... These are clean. These are perfect. They were washed in the river. The river. Just... That's, that's brandy. I shall give that as a gift to the first person that I save. And that, of course, is... That is my diploma. I'll get out of your way. -Shall I take... -No! I'm sorry. I thought... [dog barks] What's a water devil? I don't know. Perhaps I'll ask him. We can sleep now. If you could remember just to blow out the lamp. Sorry. You... you'll be all right here for as long as you need. All right lad. [door bolts] Hmm? [dog whines] Uh-huh. [bird chittering] -Ready? -Ready. Now get that. Make a loop. Right. Around the neck. Without falling in now. Pull tight. Ah! Very good. You got it. That was very fast. [sighs] All right. -Again? -Yeah. All right. What is a water devil? Oh. Oh, he can be different things, you know. Tell me. Well, uh... Well, he could be a dwarf, you know, or he could be a naked girl standing in the water. Or it might be a big fish, you know. You never know. I'm whispering because sometimes he likes to play games and we mustn't let him know where we are. -You mean he's here? -Well... Sometimes he likes to play here, you know. 'Cause he, he lives in the fairy waters. you know, ... there. What are you looking at? -[sighs] -[ducks quacking] -[bell rings] -All aboard, you scurvy pirates! -Har har! -[laughter] Splice the main brace. All hands on deck. Come on, look lively! [Andrija] Why don't you go back to your own beach, Zemba? Leave my bathers alone. I don't give a damn about your bathers. We're going for a ride! ...teach them to say ... You're teaching them? Oh, sorry, I forgot. You pulled that dog out of the water, didn't you? Well done, mate. [Andrija] This is a safe beach. This is not like your graveyard. I run an inn. People get drunk, fall in the water. -But I pull them out. -Andrija, can I take... Hasn't even got the end of his nose wet since he's been here. Now, who's this big fellow then? He's a cousin. -[Zemba grunts] -Whoa! Zemba, put him down. Cousin, eh? I bet cousin's got a mummy, has he? Sorry, gentlemen, we're full. Off we go! [Zemba] All aboard! [man] Aye-aye, captain. [chuckles] [Zemba] Let's get those engines started! In you go. [grunts] [man] Just save someone for Christ's sake, Andrija. I... It's not my fault the beach is safe. [motor whirring] [children chattering] -[motor starts] -[children cheering] [insect buzzing] -[woman] How do you stand this? -Huh? Oh. You know why God made mosquitoes? Because watching the lazy fishermen got on his nerves, so he sent mosquitoes to make them jump. Or... Or do something. You know we have no papers? [children chattering] [Andrija] Look here. [motor whirring] See who that is? [woman] It's the old lady. Ha. He gave her back the body, you see? [Zemba] Right. Let's go, boys. [woman] Who's that woman? [Andrija] She the new singer at ... [boy] Zemba, she got great melons, too. Come on then, come on. [dog barking] -[dog continues barking] -[panting] Mommy. Look. [suspenseful music playing] [man speaking indistinctly] -[people speaking indistinctly] -[man] That's right. Come here. [instrumental music continues] A nice day? You have your own beach. I know. But the partisans are shooting at it. [people speaking indistinctly] Come here... Let's get you dry. [girl] I don't like him, mommy. [people speaking indistinctly] Look sharp. Are they going to swim here now? Oh, I... I don't know. I... I don't know. Maybe not today. [bell dings]. Great, Andrija. [bell dinging in distance] [man] Come on you lot... [speaking indistinctly] The new commandant. [intense music playing] [Andrija whispering] Well, for God's sake fellows, let's get rid of this stuff. [speaking indistinctly] [man grunting] -[whispering] Come on! -[man] What happens if the Germans find out. [Andrija] Come on, hurry it up. Pick it up. [mellow music playing] [man] Oh, you're here at last. Well, better late than never. Come on then, let's have it. -Well, hello my darling. -[man] Steady, steady. [horse whinnies] [woman] Oh, ha ha. [speaking indistinctly] I'm not joking boys. Come on, this is serious stuff. [man speaking indistinctly] Zemba says the Germans are using the beach. Oh... It's the Mayor. The mayor gave them permission. Yeah, the mayor. Te dead son of a bitch, the mayor. You know what he does? He licks their ass al the time. We'll have to find a safer place. What? Why? What do you mean? They're safe. They're safe here. They are. They're safe here. They're n trouble to me. Sure there's no trouble to you. But what about the Germans? Well, I'll say they're family. Family? What happens when they come around and ask for their papers? Sooner or later they have to have papers. And another thing, you'll lose your job. Why? Why would they lose my job? Because you're not needed here. -Well-- -No, listen to me. Look at this river. It's not even a bathtub. Well, it's not my fault. What are you going to do if you're saddled with them? -I don't know. -Hmm? -I don't know. -Oh. [fluttering sound] [whispering] They won't sack somebody if he has a family. -That's what I'm saying. -Yeah, I know. But you have to do more than say that. -What do you mean? -I mean you have to marry the girl. -Marry the girl? [chuckles] -Marry her. -Well, I can't marry her. -Well, I don't... [shushing] Listen to me. Don't really marry her. I mean it comes as a convenience. It's not for real. -A convenience? -Yes. A convenience. It's all a ... You're pretending. But I don't... I... I've never... I've never been married. You don't have to be married. Good for you. And it's better for them. She's going to have a roof over her head... -Yeah. -...and you'll keep your job. -[chuckles] -Think about it. -I'm thinking. I'm thinking. I'm thinking. -Think. [laughs nervously] I can't lie. [laughs] -[dog barks] -[Martin] What are you laughing at? Will you take me fishing tonight? -Yes? -Will I take you fishing? No, I don't think the fish are biting tonight. -How do you know? -Here, take my hand. Now, feel the bones. Feel them hard. Do they feel like they're aching? That means the fish aren't biting. That mean I can't take you. Is it true the devil lives in this part of the river, too? [Martin] What? The devil? The devil doesn't live around his house. The devil lives around my house. understand? -I'll take you. -No. Everyone laughs at you. -Why did you say that? -Because it's true. -Who says it's true? -Coling and Joss. [woman] That's their opinion. You must make up your own mind about people. I've always told you that. [speaking indistinctly] -I suppose so. -What do you mean, suppose so? -[exhales] -Uh... Children are like that, you know. They just need time. [Martin] They're just like fish. When you catch one, you don't know why you did and when you don't catch one, you don't know why you didn't. [vehicles approaching] -Hello. -Hello. Hello. I'm sorry about that. Oh... [intense music playing] [car door closes] [speaking German] [mellow music playing] [woman singing] [indistinct chatter] You, uh... You're going to have to have a new name. A real name. But what's real around here, you know... At times like these, you know, I told the council that I had saved lives, you know, on another river, and I hadn't, not a single one. Not one. And what that means... That means that they can sack me and I've spent my whole life by the river. It's not easy, you know, to tear yourself away from the water. It gets under your skin. Do you know the risk involved if I take your name? Yeah, he knows. You're a really good man, Andrija. No. No. No. No, the river's good. Especially around here. You know, because it gives, and it... Because it gives and it doesn't, it doesn't take. You know? And I grumble because it doesn't take. How does that... How does that make me a good man? [violin music playing] [wind whistling] [bird calls] Uh... Just have to... I just have to make the devil laugh, you know [Martin chuckles] Mmm. Well, there's one thing that'll have to be real. -[Martin] What's that? -The rain. -Why? -Well... When it rains, the beach is closed and I can have a day off. [both laugh] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] What am I doing? [Martin] God will forgive you. [priest] God will, but the Germans won't. The ring. Thank you. Give me your hands. Hurry. Hurry. I don't want him to be my father. It's good if they think he is. -[Danny] He isn't. -[inaudible] [Martin] You be a good boy, then I'll take you fishing. -[Ana] On the third finger. -[Andrija] On this ... [Ana] Yeah. -[Andrija] Okay. -To the fairy waters? -[Martin] That's right -Today? -If it stops raining. -[priest] Please, for goodness' sake. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. [all] Amen. [indistinct chatter] [door bell dings] [truck engine revving] [thudding] [speaking indistinctly] Okay, go. [truck engine revving] Now, my dear, place the ring on his finger. The ring. I now pronounce you man and wife. You can stand up now. Thank you. You can do that at home. Sing here. Martin, you'll sign the register. [Ana] You sign your name here after me. Danny! Danny! Danny! [Danny grunts] -[grunting] -No, Danny. [both panting] It doesn't mean anything. [gasps] [metal clinking] -Better? -Um-hmm. Thank you. Sign here please. Uh, what about the papers? [Andrejia] You can have them tomorrow. Close the church at once. [speaking indistinctly] -[footsteps approaching] -[panting] You can pick up your certificate tomorrow. Thank you. [Danny] Hey, Martin! Look! [birds chirping] [Andrija chuckles] That's funny stuff, isn't it? It just lost a little..., you know. It's the fairy water carpet. Don't stand on it though. Otherwise, splosh. [chuckles] Is that why the catfish can't see? Well, no, the catfish can't see because it's blind. That's why we use this, you see. 'Cause it makes a little... Listen. Little plopping noises. Like a fish, you know, jumping out of the water. And the catfish hears that, and swims towards it to swallow it. And gets caught on the hook. Well, that's the idea, but no one's ever caught it. [fluttering] How come the water devil doesn't hear the noise? Oh, oh, he does. He does. He hears everything. The water devil, he hears everything. Here you go. Well, that's... That's how the catfish caught my father. -What? -Oh, yes. Oh, the catfish got my father. [Ana] How? [Andrija] Well, Martin and my father had a bet. You know, as to who would be the first to catch the catfish. What does it look like? No, nobody's ever seen it, you know. It just the furrow, you know, in the water and all the strange drownings. Maybe it's even the devil sometimes. [Andrija] Oh, I must have been about your age. I was sitting in the boat behind my father and he had his hand, you know, in the water with this... and Martin was in the second boat and we waited, you know, for oh... A long time. Long time. And then... And then suddenly we saw... We saw the furrow and it was coming. It was coming straight at us. -And? -It got caught. You know? It got, it got caught. But, but my father had the hook tied to his hand, and he couldn't get it undone. And he tried, you know, he tried to fight it off. And I was pulling and pulling his other hand. But we both went in the water. And... And he couldn't swim. You know? Couldn't swim and he lived on the water? No, no fisherman can swim. What happened then? [laughs] No. No, you'd laugh if I told you. No, we won't. Oh, I... I used to tell people, uh, but then they laughed when I told them, and then I stopped. I stopped telling them. And you don't know me very well. And you might think, you know... Well, you might think I was... You know? Well... Well, it was... I was in the water, you know, and I... And I was drowning, except that it seemed... It seemed like I was high above the river, you know, like I was floating, you know, like a bird. I could see everything. And I could see my father and me drowning and Martin was rowing... was rowing towards us. And I saw my father... I saw my father push me away. And although he didn't say anything, it seemed, it seemed like, like I heard him say, "Go back, Andrija, go back. There's something still that you have to do on the river." And, and, and then he, like, it's like he winked at me, you know, like, you know? Like he was encouraging me and, and... And... He just disappeared. Where did your father go? I don't know. Maybe didn't go anywhere. You know, the water devil, he likes to keep the souls of drowned people here, you know, just to make him laugh. What makes the water devil laugh? [Andrija] Oh, everything. Everything makes him laugh. Oh, uh... Us talking and the way your mother's sitting and how we met maybe. He finds that all very funny. Let's go fishing. [Martin exhales] Come on! I give you holy bread, and you give me fish. Please. [Danny] What's he doing? [Andrija shushing] [animal calling] [Andrija whispers] Goodnight. [footsteps approaching] [indistinct chatter] [suspenseful music playing] -[car doors close] -[men speaking indistinctly] [men continue speaking indistinctly] [men singing mourning songs] I was 23 when I first met my husband. We were at the same university. We married. Spent seven years together. Until the war came. So many of our friends kept disappearing. Then one night... he didn't come home. He was killed. I never think it'll happen to you. Danny was with his grandparents that summer. And I went there to join him. The Germans came. And when they shot three... They took more than half the village and killed them. Including his grandparents. We were lucky we got away. I've been running ever since. [singing continues] [Martin] Um... Good night, Andrija. Good night. [men speaking indistinctly] [animal calling] [Andrija whispering] The rex is coming. [imitates engine noise] [imitates ship horn] [blows raspberries] Uh! Good morning. Good morning. [suspenseful music playing] [children playing] [boy] Why should Danny always take lessons. Danny always does this. I think we should have a turn. We never get a turn. [bike engine starts] [engine revving] [boy continues speaking indistinctly] [Danny] You have to train to do this job. -And to earn it. -[laughter] And now, I will show you how to do exactly the same. [Zemba whistles] Hey! No, no, no, no. You got it wrong. Those are for me. If you approach him from the front, he will pull you down with him. Especially if you've been swimming quickly and got out of breath. Why is it important that you don't get out of breath? [Danny] Because it's a matter of life and death. Right. That's why you have to ... from behind and take both the arms like this. Only if there's no other choice, knock him out and pull him out. Very good. That's very good. That's very good. [Andrija in distance] Now lesson number six. The rescue from the boat. The golden rule is, never, get out of the boat.... Don't you think that when you save a drowning man, they never say thank you? -Oh, Zemba. -No, it's true. It's like they hate you. Let 'em drown. [Andrija speaking indistinctly] Are you the lifeguard? Yes, yes, I am. -Oh, look at that. -[Andrija] Sorry about your trousers. [Andrija] It's just water. [clerk] How long have you bee at the bathing beach? Oh, I've been here since it began. [clerk] A long time. Well, it doesn't, it doesn't feel long to me, you know. There's always something to do. It says here you're paid to be a lifeguard. Yes. Yes. I have a diploma. How may cases have you had? How many cases? You mean like... like how many huts have I repaired? Now don't play the fool with me, Gavrilovic. You know very well what I mean. How many lives have you saved? Leave the man alone. [clerk] Doctor, please, don't interfere in council affairs. How many? Well, well, none. What do you mean "none"? Well, no one's ever been in trouble. That's... that's... And you've been pocketing your pay packet this whole time? Ooh-hoo, some pay packet. [clerk] Doctor, please. Even the tiniest pay packet is huge when you get it for doing nothing. Stop crowding forward. Get... Well, it is not my fault that the water's safe. -I certainly hope-- -Certainly hope people will start drowning? -Get off! Are you mad? -[Andrija] No. [clerk] Can't you see what times we live in? [whispering] [laughter] Everything all right? Yes. -[clerk] Get off. -[laughter] You mean that, that you're sacking me? [clerk] I do not mean we're sacking you. -[Clerk] Head off! -[children giggle] The council can't afford to pay you. -Get off! -[Doctor] You can't sack him just like that! He's a family to keep. [clerk] A family? No mention of a family in here. Get of this plank, please. Please could you step back, everybody, please! They're refugees. [clerk] Refugees? [bell ringing] [Zemba] Now. Help! [Zemba] Lifeguard! Where's the lifeguard? -He's really drowning! -Help! What are you waiting for? The kid, the child will drown. That's just Zemba playing the fool. [humming dramatic tune] [clerk] I'm just doing my job. [Zemba] He's drowning! -Help! -[Zemba] Come on, move, man! Take it. You can do it. [Zemba] Save! Come on! Get on the boat. Come on. [boys chanting] Andrija! Andrija! Andrija! [Zemba] All right, hang on, we're coming. Help! Help! Help! [all chanting] Andrija! Andrija! Andrija! Andrija! Ugh! [Zemba] All right, that's enough, Danny. Go and help him. Get hold of him. Bring him here. Come on. -[Danny] Zemba, help him. -Get him over here. Get him into the boat. -Come on, let's have you. -[Danny] Take him. Come on. Up. Up you come. Heavy man. [grunting] Now wake up, come on. I'm sorry. Get out of here. Get out. But they were your orders. I didn't mean it really. It was only for fun, not to kill him. Bugger off. [children cheering] Answer me. You're okay? [dog whimpering] [Andrija gasps] Well done. [exhales] [Andrija] I've been sacked. [bird tweets] Danny hasn't as much as looked at me since. He just thinks I'm a complete fool. [giggles] No, he doesn't. It was an accident. You knew he was pretending. [Ana] Yes. -Well, you knew didn't you? -Of course. What if he'd really been drowning? But he wasn't. That makes it worse, you know. He was... He was pretending so that he could help me. And I end up nearly drowning, and I'm the lifeguard. [Ana] For goodness' sake! Well, they won't be joking this time. This time they really will sack me. Then we'll have to leave. Well, it won't be the first time. Now... [laughs] There's still nothing there. [mellow music playing] [airplanes whooshing] [rumbling] [Danny] Mummy! Mummy! -[somber music playing] -[rumbling continues] Is that the catfish going by? Shh. Go back to sleep. Please give my father back. [melancholy music playing] [eerie music playing] [animal calling] [animal calling] [birds fluttering] [grunts] [sighing] [Martin] No, wait. Wait. So, you always give him the first one. See, that way, he doesn't spoil your catch. Does it ever leave the fairy waters? Who? You mean the water devil? [sighs] I don't know. Maybe if you give him a sacrifice that's as evil as he is. What does that mean? Do you believe in dreams? No. -The fishermen do. -All of them? Yeah. How? Well, let me tell you something. It's a secret. If you dream that you're flying in the air, that means you're going to have a very good catch. And if you dream that you'e up to your neck and you're treading water, that means that you're gonna get very drunk. But if you dream that you actually saw a fish, that means there's big trouble coming. Last night, did you dream of flying? No. [laughs] I dreamt that I was up to my neck in water. -What did you dream? -I dreamt about the catfish. [eerie music playing] -[Ana] Danny! -[Andrija] Ana! -Ana? -[Ana] Danny! -Ana. -I can't find him! -[dog whimpers] -Ana, he's all right. Ana, he's with Martin. He's with Martin. It's all right. Danny's all right. There are fish in the pond. That means Martin's been here. He must have gone back with him. It's all right. Calm. Calm. Stay here. Don't move. I'm going to get him. All right? [suspenseful music playing] Danny! Danny! Danny! [plopping] [spits] Look, it's the girl from Zemba's. -Are you sure? -Yes, I saw her. Look, it's Andrija! He's saved someone! Get me the coat. Here, cover him with that. Don't make so much noise. Noise is not his problem. ... Look at the leg, look! -I know. -[Martin] Catfish almost got him, didn't he? I know. I know. Oh, he looks pretty ugly to me. I'd throw him back in. You'd ... staring death in the face, would you? He's not ... you know. He's probably married with a family. A boy and a girl. What were you, the best man at the wedding or something? No. Oh, no, no, no, no. I mean it's a custom with gentlemen. He's not a gentleman. Look at him. He's not a gentleman. He's a peasant from the wood. He's probably a partisan. He's not a partisan. Partisans are fighting the Germans. Not swimming in the river. And when did you last see a peasant in the water? Well, it's better to have a peasant who gives you a piece of bread than a rich man who only gave you thanks. [gasps] Is he dead? No. No, he's not dead. -He's alive! -I told you he's alive. Well, he still looks ugly to me. I'd throw him back in. -Shut up! -[chuckles] Hello. Hello. You're all right. I don't know. [creaking] [leaves rustling] Look, there's Catfish. Look there, Danny. Danny, Danny, there, there. -You see him? -[Danny gasps] [wind whistling] Ana! Ana! Ana! [Ana] What's the matter? Ana! -Where's Danny? -He's, he's gone... He's gone to fetch a doctor with Martin. In town? It's all right. He's with Martin. -What? -Just help me. -What's happened? -Just... Just take this. -Go on. Go on. -Oh, my God. [Andrija coughs] -Who is this? -I don't know. Is he dead? No. No, he's not dead. Look at his leg. Look at his leg. Catfish almost got him. [Andrija gasps] -[dog whimpers] -Go on, get off. Be careful. Because he's a man, not a log Get the brandy. The brandy. Get it. Get it. The brandy. Get the brandy. You see, I've never seen a more amazing drowning man. He mustn't catch cold. He's mustn't... He mustn't catch cold. You should lie on the other side. -[Ana] Why? -To keep him warm. [clinking] You know... You know, this is just the beginning. The devil has finally decided that I'm not just here to make him laugh. You know, there's going to be lots more drowning men. They're going to need a lifeguard. "But where is he? He's been fired." "Well, get another one." "Well, who should we get?" "Well, who has done most for the bathing beach?" "Who's the best lifeguard? Who has just saved his first drowning man?" -Who? -Who? Andrija Gavrilovic. That's who. He's even got a diploma. And where is this, uh, Andrija Gavrilovic with his diploma? He's not here. -Why isn't he here? -He's been sacked. He was sacked for being incompetent. Incompetent? Well, how can he be incompetent? He saved someone's life. And in stormy waves. No. No, there weren't any waves. But that's what people will say. -Oh, what... -[door slams] [Ana gasps] Danny, what's happening? Do you know who he is? No. -[German officer speaks German] -A mere partisan. [speaks German] How is he, doctor? He's coming around. Perhaps he should stay here. [soldier speaking German] Yes, he could stay. He could stay... Careful. Mind his head. -If you... -[German officer] Stay with him, doctor. -Please. -Thank you. Who saved him? You? Well, he was drowning. I'm the lifeguard. [Ana whispers] That's all right. He's gone. He saved someone. -You saved someone! -Now they'll kill him. -Oh no, they won't. -They won't. Oh, he just saved a drowning man. -We must drink to his life. -Will he live if I have some? -[Ana] No! -Yes! Ugh! I told you. [mellow music playing] [rustling] [vehicles approaching] [intense music playing] Oh, my God. I forgot to lock the fence. -Wake up. -[dog whines] Come on! It's the Germans. Come on. Go in there. [Andrija] I'm sure it's nothing. Just in case. [men shouting] [intense music playing] [men shouting] [Danny] What's happening? What's happening? Are they coming for us? [Ana] No, love. [speaking German] [guns firing] [screams] Andrija Gavrilovic? [soldiers speaking German] [man] Treat them like ourselves. -[man shouting] -[soldiers shouting] [officer] So, you are the lifeguard at the beach? Yes. Yes, I'm the lifeguard. Then what were you doing on that part of the river? Nothing. It was just, you know, like a change of air. -Meeting partisans? -No. No, no. I never... I never meet partisans. No. I've got a family to consider. They have families, too. So, what happened then? Nothing. I just went back. And what about the man you pulled out of the river? No, I never pulled out, out of anything. Then what was he doing at your place on the beach? [typewriter clacking] He was... I found him. I found he was lying on the river bank. He was just lying on the bank. [clears throat] On the bank of the river. On the bank. you know. [speaking German] Pull yourself together. What really happened? There's no messing with him. He's worse than the plague. Sir, I never saved any... I've, I've never... I never saved anyone ever, in my whole life. Specially not a partisan. You can ask them, as them at the beach. They... I... And anyway, that... That bit of the river, it's not really, it's not really water. It's just like a shitty swamp. German officer don't go swimming in shitty swamps. [speaking in German] [phone ringing] -That's all. -Sir. Oh, so... [groaning] [officer speaks German] Major Von Richter. The new district commander. Andrija Gavrilovic. The lifeguard at the beach. Oh. How are you feeling? Is he really better? [speaking German] Good, good. The Major is feeling fine. Your leg... The Major is feeling fine. And let go of his leg. [speaking indistinctly] What do you want now? I told you everything I know. [man in distance] You want to be in the picture. All of you, Don't you? Smaller people... smaller people in front, larger people in the back. [indistinct chatter] Closer. Closer, everybody. [continues speaking indistinctly] You half-witted cretin. Don't you ever think? The man was drowning. I'm the lifeguard. Anyone else would have let the bastard drown. Yes, well, he wasn't wearing any clothes. [Mayor] Of course he wasn't. Shagging our girls by night. Add, killing them in the day. [Andrija] That's not my fault. [Mayor] Try telling Zemba that. [officer speaking German] [playing fanfare] [camera whirring] [man speaking German] You must go up now. -[Major speaking German] -[officer] I present this medal in gratitude... for your bravery. Yours was not merely an act of duty, but proof of the respect this country has... Idiot! Stand still and look at him! ...for the great ... and it's leader, Adolf Hitler. -Hail! -[all] Hail! [officer speaks German] [officer speaks German] [speaks softly in German] Stop! Stop, idiot! You haven't got your medal yet. You stay where you are. You stand still now. [camera whirring] [officer speaks German] What are you doing? This is my medal. It was only for the film. [soldiers speaking German] [speaking indistinctly] Maybe you like your major-- -I don't want your-- -No. [Andrija] Shitty medal. [somber music playing] [wind howling] [Danny] What does it mean? The water devil... go away, if a sacrifice to him is made. A greater evil than himself. -Do you know? -[Andrija] No. -Are you sure? -Mmm-hmm. Does Martin know? Well, he must. Because he's made an agreement with him. What kind of agreement? Well, first he steals a communion bread from the church. You know what it is? It's the body of Christ. It's small and round and white. Does the water devil like them? Well, he must. Because when Martin throws one in the water, he says, "A holy bread for you, and some fish for me." Well, he always catches plenty of fish. But like all fishermen that make agreements with the water devil, he'll come to a sticky end. [somber music playing] [Andrija speaks indistinctly] Danny. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [boy] I'll be a partisan. -What about me? What should I be? -[shushing] [whispers] Goes without saying. Local traitor. -No. -It's who we're going to be when the liberation comes. -The crowds? Jos? -I'm protected by the rule. But why me? Because your father is a traitor too. That's not true! [boys grunting] Ana. What does it say? -It says that you saved this man's life. -Hmm. -And in very bad weather. -Oh. [chuckles softly] And that you're very brave. And it says how much I love the Germans? No. Don't. They're liars! -I know. -[door opens] Danny. [intense music playing] [bombs exploding] You should go in. What's the difference? Will it ever end? [Andrija] I suppose it will. Where will you go when it does? [Ana] I don't know. What about you? [Andrija] Oh. Yeah. Where else? [chuckles] -And we have... Oof. -[bomb explodes] I've got to keep him laughing. [Ana] The little water devil? -[horse neighs] -[Major] Andrija! Andrija! Get the bloody move on. [Andrija] It's the Mayor. [Mayor] After all I've done, they start shooting through my bloody windows. -[Andrija] Who? -The people, of course. They're animals. So they've branded us both. Don't lump me in with you. I was only doing my duty. [indistinct chatter] Richter's found out who you are. [Andrija] You could stay the night here, you know. There's plenty of room. [Mayor] We're leaving. Should Andrija come with us? No. [Mayor] ...into the bloody sea. [Andrija] You know, it'd be quicker to go by road. [Mayor] They are bombing it, you ... [Andrija] Oh. Where will you go? [Major] As far away from here as possible. Give me the lamp. -[Andrija] The what? -The lamp. [Andrija] Oh, the lamp. Why you? You think there'll be time to explain that I was just a doctor and you a lifeguard? [Andrija] I didn't know he was a German. [Doctor] Not only a German, but a killer. [Andrija] Just for... It's not about friends or enemies, is it? It's... It's about drowning or not drowning. And he was drowning. Now he's got his breath back, he's a killer again. [Doctor] Take care. Not on you own anymore. -What can I do? -Well, use your head! Use your head for once! [Andrija] Good luck. -Hello. -Hello. [Ana] I'm so sorry. We have to leave too. -We have to. -[Andrija] I don't understand why. -Why? -No. -Do we have to go? -Yes? -[Andrija speaking indistinctly] -[Danny] Why? [Ana] Please. -Then why do you have to leave? -Because we have to. -Well, tell me why. -[Ana speaks indistinctly] [Ostoja] Ana, please, hurry. Do you know Ostoja? Yes. He was a friend of my husband's. Please don't worry. What? [Ostoja speaking indistinctly] [horse whinnies] [dog whimpering] [vehicles approaching] [soldiers speaking German] [engines whirring] [indistinct chatter] [Andrija] Oh. Hey. Why don't you come over? [boy] Because you're a traitor! What... What is the matter with everyone? I-I-I'm not a traitor. When your people leave, we'll kill you. What... [soldier speaking German] They're not my people. -[whistle blows] -[soldiers shouting] They're... My people are the.... [whistle blowing] [truck horn toots] [truck engines starting] [German patriotic song playing over gramophone] [screams] [German music continues] [feet stomping] [music stops] [crying] Did you know it? He was a German. Did you know that? You... You... [Martin] Andrija. Andrija! Martin? -[Martin] Here, get over here. -[Andrija] What? Martin, if...as if taken out of, and done it because they think... Hold it up, hold it up. First they think I'm a traitor. You're not a traitor. You're not a traitor. What... What are you doing? I'm getting this. That's what I'm doing. -What's that? -That's dynamite. -What are you going to do-- -Never mind what I'm going to do with it. [stammering] Are they... Are the people really going to kill all the doctors and the fishermen and I mean, any waiter who served the German? [Martin shushing] Will you shut up? -What are you-- -I don't know. I don't know what they're going to do. Because they're like catfish. And when they're hungry, they're not choosy. They're liable to do anything. The Germans are leaving the town, Now we have to go, you understand? -What... What are you? -Shut up! We have to go. Go to the fairy waters and wait for me. Just wait for me. Go on, get your boat. Don't look at me. Go on! [Martin] Go on, hurry up. [Zemba] Don't worry. Everything's set. It's prepared. [wind whistling] [boat creaking] [eerie music playing] [man] Now wake up. Come on. [intense music playing] I'm all right. [men speaking indistinctly] [vehicle approaching] [indistinct shouting] [woman screaming]. Oh, God. Oh, God, don't. [soldier shouting] Go on. Will you listen to me? Move! Go! [indistinct shouting] [woman screaming] [intense music playing] [Danny] Mummy! [woman shouting] [whispers] Martin. Martin. [panting] -[child] Mummy! -[child screams] [soldier speaking German] Martin. Martin. [Andrija yells] Martin! Ana and Danny are on the bridge. -Go away! Go away! -[solder shouting] -[child] Mommy! -Go away! [guns firing] -[dynamite explodes] -[children screaming] [child] Mummy! [screaming] [child] Mummy! Mummy! -[screaming continues] -[soldier shouting] [shouting] [crying] [gun firing] Martin! Martin. [soldier shouting] [intense music playing] [man screaming] [gasping] [speaking indistinctly] [gasping] [Andrija pants] -[soldiers shouting] -[ammunition firing] Ana? Give me your hand. Ana! [airplane whooshing] Ana. Ana! [shouting in German] Don't! Hey! Hey! [Andrija screams] Don't! [Andrija] Ana! [Danny] Andrija, no! [Ana] Run! Please run! [Ostoja] Come on. [Andrija] Run! Run! Run!
