(melancholic piano music) - [Man] You're making a mess of yourself. - [Woman] Oh. Sorry, what? - I said you're making a mess of yourself. - Oh! It's okay. - [Man] What's that supposed to be? - Um, it's nothing really, it's just... - Yeah (chuckles) it looks like nothing. (laughs) - I'm just playing with color. - Yeah, children do that. - Oh. No, it's different than that. - Really? - But you're home early! - [Man] For a good reason. - What's that? - [Man] I thought a little celebration was in order. - Celebration for what? Oh, oh! You closed the deal! - Yes! - Oh my god! Oh, that's wonderful! - That whole block, is going to have my name on it. - Oh, that's wonderful. - They just told me an hour ago and I wanted to rush home and share it with the woman I love. - That's so fantastic. Oh, wait, I just... It, it's, sorry, it's water-based. - It's okay, it needs to be dry-cleaned anyway. So, let's celebrate, huh? - Yes! - Yes. - Where? - Here. - Oh, okay. - Yes. I've invited the backers over with their wives, for a small dinner party. - Oh, tonight? (husband chuckles) - Yeah, in about three hours. That's okay, right? - Of course! - Yeah. - Okay. - That's my babe! (chuckles) Woo! Whoa, oh, whoa, Shane, Shane, what's this? - Oh, it's just a spot, I'll get it. I'll just go get the stuff right now, it comes right off. - Okay, alright, alright. (sighs) (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Shane] Matt, I'm almost ready! - [Matt] You're wearing that? - Well, I wanted to look nice for you. - Me, yeah, but are you trying to turn everybody on? - Who? - Are you doing this to me on purpose? - I don't understand. - It looks cheap, change it. - Oh, but it's your favorite for a dress. - Yeah I know and it's great and I love the whore thing but, we've got people coming over. - Okay. Well, what do you want me to wear? - Just use your head, alright? (doorbell rings) And don't be too long, you know how I hate small talk. - Okay. (sighs) - Here's to Matthew's entrepreneurial brilliance. - Well, let's not get carried away. I mean, our mall isn't even built yet, much less a success. - Oh honey, we're celebrating tonight, not worrying. Matt, what did you say your lovely wife's name was again? - It's... - Shane. Shane, sweetheart. - (chuckles) Oh, that's right, Shane. And when will we get to meet her? - You don't. I keep her slaving over a hot stove in the kitchen. I never let her out. (Matt and guests laugh) No, I love my wife, she's a perfectionist, so I'm sure she's probably putting her final touches on the dinner table. (doorbell rings) Excuse me. - Oh, I like him. Charming. - Mr. Han. Welcome. - Good evening, Matt. I'd like to introduce you to my wife, Lorielle. - Very nice to meet you, Matt. - It's nice to meet you. - [Shane] Matt, honey, all ready! - (sighs) And that's my wife. Please, make your way into the dining room. Ladies and gentlemen, let's make our way into the dining room. Please, after you. (sighs) - Take a bathe, come on. - Matthew, see you in the morning. - You and Shane make such an adorable couple. Goodnight. - (chuckles) Goodnight. We love you guys, too! - Matt, Matt listen, (chuckles) I may be a big cynic but, I'm also a big fan. You knocked it out of the park tonight. - Thank you, sir. - That's why I love him. Your home is perfect, we'll have you both over soon. - Oh, we'll look forward to that. - Great, goodnight. - Thank you, bye bye. - I second that, this has been an absolute pleasure. - Hopefully this will be the first of many projects to come. - (sighs) Thanks. - And please, thank Shane again for us. - I will, I will, goodnight, you guys. - Goodnight. - Take care! (sighs) The wine was too cold. - Oh, I thought you were supposed to chill chardonnay. - It wasn't a chardonnay, it was a Riesling. Details, Shane, it's supposed to be served 20 degrees below room temperature. - Okay. - If you need me to write it down, I will for you. - No, no, I got it. - 'Cause I mean, you say you get it, but, if you're having trouble remembering things, just make a list. - Okay. Okay, well I'm just gonna clean up here and... - No, no no no, no no no. Leave it. We're gonna continue celebrating. - Well, somebody has to do it. - Yeah, so you'll do it tomorrow. You've got other duties to do. (tense atmospheric music) You've gotta make up for the wine. I wanna see you strip. - Matt... - Come on. Tease me. - I'm, uh, kind of tired. - Dance for me. No, no, no, don't face me. I wanna see you watch yourself in the mirror as you do it. Yeah. I'll never get tired of you. (chuckles) That's my little whore. (water sprays) (dark orchestral music) (Shane sobs) - No, I wouldn't go that way, man. Trail turns to sheer ice around the bend. - [Matt] I know! - You're gonna break your neck! - You work up on the mountain? - Yeah, I work up on the zip line. You and your wife ever try it? - You mean that hanging thing over the canyon? - Well, there's three of them actually. Black Devil's over the canyon, Beaver Tail's over the creeks and Deer Park's over the trails. It's a lot of fun, just prepping it for the winter. Season will be open soon and it's real pretty when the lights are on. - I can imagine. I'm, uh, I'm Matt Walsh. - Jake. - Hey, you just moved in a couple weeks ago, huh? I meant to say hi. - Well, nice to meet ya. - Yeah. So how'd you know I was married? (Jake chuckles) You mentioned my wife. - Right, uh yeah, sorry man. No, it's just I walk along the lake past your house every day and it's beautiful by the way, but I always notice a woman sitting by the window, and she paints so just kind of put two and two together. - How old are you? - 24. - 24. Yeah, well don't get married at least until you're 35. - Yeah, I'll try to remember that. - Yeah, yeah, don't try, just do it. - Oh. - Nice talking to you. - [Jake] Hey, you too. (thunder rumbles) (door closes) - Oh. So how was your run? - So-so, I had to cut early. - Okay, well breakfast is almost ready, and I just, I'm running a little late. - It can wait. Don't worry about that, come here. - Oh, what about your... - It can wait, come. What do you see out there? - Outside? - [Matt] (chuckles) Of course outside. What is outside? - The lake? - Exactly. And if you can see it from up here where you're sitting, people along the lake can look up and see you, and what do you think they see when they do that? - Painting? (Matt chuckles) - This isn't painting. This is an embarrassment. See, all those people are looking up here, and they don't know what you're doing, they think you're a retarded child. - Oh, I don't think they think that. - Shut up and look at me. (sighs) I don't mean to sound harsh, but you haven't got it. You just haven't, now I paid for the classes, and I paid for the books and I paid for all the crap, and you know what I get? I get strangers gazing up at you, and you know what they see? You're up here with this smock, your big paint smock and it's halfway undone. - No, no it's not. - No, no, I don't know if that's true or not. I mean, you got this big blouse and your breasts are hanging out. - I don't... - You think you're an artist, you think you're feeling free, but you know what? (thunder rumbles) What do you think they think of me, huh? What do you think? They see you up here and they think, "Oh, well somebody like that, huh? "He can't do any better than that, huh?" You don't know what they think because you think you're an artist. Here's a life lesson. Here's a life lesson. (tense atmospheric music) (sighs) Artists... Are born. They're born with that talent, you cannot go to school, and you cannot learn it. Especially you. I think we can do this together. I want you to say, I'm not an artist. - Matt, I enjoy it. - No, no no no, you don't enjoy it. - Okay. - Just, just say it! - Okay but wait, you have me at home all by myself. I have nothing to do. - Just say it, Shane! - Okay. I'm not an artist. (sobs) - There you go, yes. You're not an artist. That wasn't so hard. - No. - That wasn't so hard. - No. - So now we can clear out all this crap, and we can create a nursery. Then people will know why I married you. - We talked about this. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. We talk about a lot of things and you don't listen. - I'm not ready yet to have a... A child. - Is that because of the new neighbor? - [Shane] Who? - Oh, don't pretend, Shane! Because he's very familiar with you. - I don't know who you're talking about. I've never met the new neighbor. - The new neighbor says that he comes by this window and there you are, waving to him. He looks forward to it and you know what, I bet that that's why your painting is not improving. Huh? It's not improving because you are waiting all the time for him to walk by and you're waiting for him! - You misunderstood. - Yes, it is happening! (tense orchestral music) Don't you ever touch it again! (thuds) I want my baby. (Shane sobs) And not that new neighbor's baby! I don't want that! I don't want his! I want mine! Why did you make me do this? Huh? Why did you make me do this? (Shane sobs) I want that room cleared out. - That fall could have been a lot worse, Mrs. Walsh. You're lucky. - I'm lucky? - If you have any more accidents like this, I want you to give me a call, okay? Any time, day or night. - If I do call you, then what can you do? - Anything I can. There are programs and support groups for situations like this. - You haven't had your practice for long. That's why my husband hired you. I've had eight doctors in six years. Two of them were threatened with malpractices. - Really? - Just think certain things just aren't as easy and simple as people think they are. - No, I guess not. - So, if I call you, what can you actually do? (doctor sighs) - Sleep. It's the best thing for you right now. - Thanks anyway. (Matt chuckles) - You know, I just don't get it, doc. She gets this idea to go up on the roof and sketch some scenery. And I told her something like this could happen, but, she's an artist. (chuckles) What am I gonna do with someone like that? - You know, your wife could have been very seriously hurt. - She's gonna be okay, right? You said a concussion, some bruises, right? - She'll be fine. In time. But you're gonna have to go easy on her. - Well what do you mean by that? - I mean her body needs time to heal. Make sure she gets plenty of rest over the next week or so. No strenuous activity. - Of course! Absolutely. You can send your bill to my office, I'll make sure that it's taken care of immediately. - Yeah. Oh, and uh... Get rid of that ladder, or lock it up. I don't wanna have to come back out here again. - Will do! (dark atmospheric music) (footsteps) (Shane moans) I miss you when you're asleep. - Oh gosh, I should make dinner. - The doctor says you need to rest. So I thought I'd get us something from that Thai place downtown? Does that sound good? - That'd be nice. - [Matt] Hey. I'm sorry. - It's alright. - (chuckles) No, no, it's not alright. We shouldn't fight like that. - It was my fault, I shouldn't have... - [Matt] No, no, it's (chuckles)... - My bad. - It's no one's fault. It doesn't matter. What matters is we love each other. Hm? And it'll never happen again, huh? - Oh, what is that? - My promise. - Oh, you shouldn't have done that. - No, no, no, I should have done it a long time ago. Put them on. Please, for me? - Ow. - There. Perfect. Now I need to know the truth. - About what? - The neighbor. Shane, you and I have been around for a long time, and you know I have this sense. I have this feeling inside of me, it's like a... A fist inside of me. There's something going on with you two. - I lied to you. - Uh-oh. - Yes, I met him last week. But it was for a surprise for your birthday. I arranged with him to take us zip lining, you and I, before they open for the season. I thought it would be something that we could do together. Unless you don't wanna go. - No, no, uh, I... I do wanna go. I do. Look, forget about everything else, forget about the business deals, forget about the trappings. It doesn't matter about anybody. But here. Here with you. What you've done, (chuckles) you've made me, the happiest man on Earth. Dinner. Huh? I will be back as soon as I can, and you, my lady, get extra noodles. Huh? (Shane chuckles) (tense atmospheric music) (Shane sobs) (car starts) (dark orchestral music) - You guys feel like taking a shortcut? It should cut off at least 20 minutes or so. - Hon, what do you think? - Oh, do you, okay, do you wanna... - Let's go! - [Jake] You can give me a hand with this. - Oh, sure. - Thanks, buddy. - Okay. (dark orchestral music) - Careful, guys. - We're good. Are you alright, hon? - Yes! - Hey, you guys, before we get up to the station, I just wanted to run you through a few of the basics. Make sure we're all prepped. Oh, no. - [Matt] What's wrong? - I forgot one of the harnesses in the truck. - Uh, well we can switch. - It's an insurance thing. Everyone on the platform needs a harness or we just don't go. - Well, I get it. - [Jake] No, that's... - Yeah, yeah, no, you guys set up and I'll run. - Please don't run, it is pretty slippery. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Shane. Aren't you forgetting something? The keys to his truck. You gotta get into his truck. - Right. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. - (sighs) Think, think. - Bye, sweetie. She's never been much of an outdoor type. - Right. (both chuckle) (dark orchestral music swells) You know what? I just realized if Shane takes the wrong fork, it's gonna take her deeper into the woods. - Well, it's your show. - Okay, let's go back, we'll head her off just in case. - Okay. - I don't understand, we should have headed her off by now. Shane! - What do you mean? - Shane! - Where is she? - I don't know. - Well, is she lost? - Just, let's ditch the gear, we gotta go find her. Follow me. - Shane! - Shane! - [Matt] Shane! - [Jake] Shane, where are you? - Shane! Shane! - Shane! - Shane! (tense atmospheric music) Jake, I don't see her! Shane! Shane! Shane! - Shane! - Shane! - Shane! Okay, I'm gonna keep going. - Shane! Shane! God. - [Reporter] An accident at Tower Canyon today may have claimed the life of Shane Walsh, the wife of prominent real estate developer Matthew Walsh. It looks like she was lost in the woods and there's no sign of her body. - [Woman] How many times is it going to happen when a... - [Reporter] A memorial service was held today after the death of local resident Shane Walsh. Her body has never been recovered. (Matt sobs) (dark orchestral music) (peaceful orchestral music) - I told you, it's in the bottom drawer! It's always in the bottom drawer. You know, we're not open yet. - [Shane] Oh, is Estelle here? - Estelle? Yeah, hang on. Estelle, somebody here to see you! Just be a second. - Okay, thanks. - Can I help you? (upbeat orchestral music) Shane? Oh my god! I don't believe it, it's been like what, six or seven years? - [Shane] Yeah, it has, something like that. - Meg, this is my cousin Shane. You've heard me talk about her. - You're Shane? - Yeah! - Nice to meet you. - You, too. - Come sit, sit, sit. Do you want some tea or something, how about some tea? - Me? - Can you make some for our guest? - Yeah, I suppose so. - [Shane] Oh, you don't have to, she doesn't have to. - Don't worry about it, she's just like that. - It's so weird to be back. Some things are exactly like I remember them, and some things you've improved on. - Thank you, it was a total struggle. You know my mother, just changing anything is such a battle. - You, how is she? - (sighs) Doing great. Constantly going on about how much better the weather is in Arizona. (Shane giggles) She would love to see you. - Oh, I know, it's been so long. - So, what are you doing here? What brings you to Bodega Bay? - Um, I just thought that I would get away for a little while and just, I needed some time on my own and... Well, you know how much I used to love spending summers here with you and so I thought I'd come visit for a little bit. - Good, great, yeah. I hope it's for more than a bit. Is that all you brought with you? - Yeah. - Do you have a place to stay? - No, the little breakfast, bed and breakfast across the street, is it still open? - That is not happening, you are staying right here with us. - Oh. - Who's staying with us? - My cousin, are you okay with that? We just live in the apartment upstairs. We've got a fold-out sofa, so you can just make yourself right at home. - Yeah, as long as you don't mind sharing the sink with somebody's laundry. - At least I don't leave wax all over the floors. - I thought you liked my idiosyncrasies. - I wouldn't have it any other way, dear. - Damn straight. - Oh, yeah, like I said, a couple of things are different. (all chuckle) (peaceful orchestral music) - I'm looking at him, then looking at her, and saying, are you kidding me? - No. - Yeah, it'd been going on for years. - [Shane] Oh my god. - So Meg sends the guy packing and, life has been sweet ever since. - Wake up call. - Changed your life. - Yeah. Wow. (sighs) I'm gonna go to bed, I work for this slave driver who insists I make my justifiably-famous muffins every morning before sun-up, so I need my beauty sleep. - Goodnight, babe. - Goodnight. Welcome, Shane. Okay. If you snore tonight, I'll poke you in the eye. - So? - [Shane] What? - You wanna tell me the truth? Why are you here? - Like I said. I missed you and I wanted to come back. - That's a load of crap and we both know it. Come on, we're family. The last I heard, you were, (sighs) married, living some place fancy. About that same time, you stopped calling, you seemed to drop off the face of the Earth. And then out of nowhere you show up without calling first. What happened to your ring? (Shane sighs) (melancholic piano music) - I was gonna hock it. - That bad? - I tried to make it work. And he always told me that he was gonna protect me, but I couldn't find one person to protect me from him. - Did he hurt you? Oh, Shane. Well, then you left the son of a bitch for a good reason. - Yeah. - [Estelle] Does he know where you went? - No, he thinks I'm dead. - Are you serious? What? You can do that? - He thinks that I had an accident. - [Estelle] Shane! How? - They never found my body. That's it, I don't wanna say anything else. I don't wanna involve you. I'm just, I'm gonna stay with you and Meg one night, and that's it. - Shane, you are blood and you're in trouble, so you, you are exactly where you're meant to be. - I don't wanna crowd you and Meg in your apartment here. - Well, you won't. Do you remember that cottage that my family has outside of town by the vineyard? Well, we've still got it. And there's no renters in there right now so it's all yours. There's no TV or phone or anything, but it's clean and the plumbing works. - Gosh, I... I don't know how much I can afford. - Who said anything about that? It's free. - No. - For as long as you want it. - No, no, I can't do that. That's sweet, I can't. - You are just like your mother. Then you can work for it. We need a waitress around here. Most of the customers are scared of Meg. You ever wait tables? - No. - Could you make sure I have all the contracts on my desk in the morning? - Sure, 9AM okay? - Yeah and I think we should take a look at that Tenners Island environmental study again. - [Man On Phone] Sure, is there a problem? - No, I wanna make sure that we look good. - [Man On Phone] Well, okay, but I mean, that's gonna take at least until noon. - Yeah, no no no, I gotcha. Just get it done, okay? - Okay. - Thanks. (peaceful orchestral music) ("La Donna e mobile" by Giuseppe Verdi) (suspenseful orchestral music) (water sprays) (percussive orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (melancholic piano music) - It's a shame. (ominous orchestral chord) Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. - What did you just call me? - I, I, I didn't call you anything. I said it's a shame that it's so cold and gray out. This summer was amazing. - Oh, was it? - Not good for you? - Oh, no, I didn't say that. - Well, you didn't have to. (chuckles) So, are you an artist or... - Oh, no. - Are you sure? I mean, that looks pretty good to me. - Who are you? - Well, I happen to the fellow that owns this property, which means that I own half of that sketch. - Gosh, I'm sorry. I'll go. - No, no no, I didn't mean anything by it, I was just trying to be funny. - How is that funny? - Well I guess if I have to explain it, I kind of missed the mark. (chuckles) - No, it's probably me, it's alright. (chuckles) - No, no, wait. Look, I'm Thomas Brisano. Welcome to Chaberton Winery. Maybe you've heard of it? - No, I'm not from here. - Well, the truth is even if you were from here, you probably wouldn't have heard of it. - Oh. Okay, well good luck with that. - [Thomas] Uh, do you have a name or... - Uh, sorry to trespass. - No, that's, that's fine! Come by anytime. (percussive orchestral music) (Shane pants) - Shane! - You got a customer out there. He looks hungry and I don't think it's 'cause of me. - Alright, you're up. - Don't laugh if I make a mistake. - That depends on how bad you do. - Oh, that's comforting. - Hey, we're all allowed to make mistakes as long as we learn from it and try not to do it again. - Okay is that the moral of the story? - [Meg] That's how I met your cousin. - You're up, go. - Good morning, sir, welcome to Porter's Cafe. Would you like some coffee or orange juice? - Um... Well, what would you suggest? - You don't give up, do you? (Thomas chuckles) - No, it's not my style. - Well, the orange juice comes from a can. The coffee is what you would expect from a place like this, and if you want something off the menu, I'd go somewhere else. - Okay. Truce? - We don't know each other, so we don't need to do that. - [Thomas] Well, we will. - No, no, I don't think so. - Well, you see, this is a very, very small town, and everybody knows everybody. For instance, people have already told me that you are the new girl that's staying at Estelle's cottage. - Would you like to order something or, are you gonna just waste my time? - Ouch, okay. - Talking. - Well, then I guess, um, I will have the three-cheese omelet. - Okay, well that comes with hash browns or potatoes. - No, just the omelet. Yeah, I'm just kind of a simple guy. - I've noticed. Okay, we have an order. - You wanna make it? - You want me to? - Yeah, anybody can cook. - Okay! - So? What do you think of her? - Honestly? - Of course. - I don't know, there's something... Something's not right. I don't know whatever hell she went through, or who this guy is that she married, but, I don't know, she's just off in her own world, you know? - That apparent? - Yeah, it's written all over her. I don't know if it's such a good thing you helping her. - Meg, I'm the only family she has. - But all she's doing is running away and dragging you into her problems. - Well, I'm not turning my back on her, if that's what you're implying. (phone rings) (phone rings) - [Matt] You've reached the Walsh residence. Leave a message after the tone. - [Woman] Hi, Mrs. Walsh, my name is Sarah and I'm calling about the GPS unit you purchased from us. I wanted to tell you that there's been a recall issue from the manufacturer... - This is Matthew Walsh. - [Sarah] Oh, hello, I was looking for Shane Walsh? - That was my wife, she passed away. - [Sarah] Oh, I'm so sorry, I'll let you go. - What's this about a recall? - [Sarah] Your wife purchased a GPS unit from us, and I was just calling to let her know the manufacturer has issued a recall, however we have never had a problem with any of the units from our store. - A GPS unit? - [Sarah] For navigation. - Yeah, I know, so you don't get lost. - [Sarah] I'm sorry, I can call another time. (ominous atmospheric music) Mr. Walsh? Mr. Walsh? (percussive orchestral music) - Can I get you anything else? - No, thank you, I'm stuffed. - You can pay at the counter. - Actually, miss. I really shouldn't have to pay this bill at all. - Why? - Well you see, I normally order the three-cheese omelet. It usually consists of this big greasy pile of half-burnt eggs with this really gross orange toxic waste oozing out the middle, and um, you see the thing is, that meal that right there, was light, fluffy and delicious. - Okay, so (chuckles) what is the problem? - Well, the problem is I didn't order light, fluffy and delicious. - Okay, well next time I will make it more disgusting. - Okay, I'll tell you what. We can overlook this whole thing if you promise to have dinner with me. - I don't think that dinner is really a good idea. - Just hear me out. You remember my winery, right? Where you did the little sketch. Okay, well see, I am going to be preparing a meal there tonight. Hm? Okay, we don't even have to call it a dinner. It's just a meal, okay? And that meal will be ready at 8PM sharp. So if you're there, great, if you're not, well, well then that's great too, because then at least I will have twice as much to eat. What do you say? - I say you're a little bit annoying. - Okay, look, at least tell me your name. - Lexi. You, uh, you forgot this in the kitchen again. - Lexi? Wow, that's a very pretty name. - Oh, thank you. - And I'm going to go pay my bill. - What did he say? - He was asking me to eat dinner with him. - "Toxic waste?" (suspenseful atmospheric music) (thunder rumbles) (ominous tones) (percussive orchestral music) (knocks) - Hi. - Hi. - Come in, it's cold. - Okay, I just wanted to tell you that I can't make it, but thank you. - You came all the way down here to tell me that to my face? - Well yes, it would be rude if I hadn't. - You're here. - Oh, I know, I don't have a phone. So I couldn't tell you, but thank you so much. - Wait, whoa whoa whoa, wait wait wait, please. Have you eaten? - I'm not hungry, really. - [Thomas] Okay, so you haven't eaten yet. - No. - Okay, then stay. Come on, or I can send some home with you. Come on, it's already cooked. If it'll make you more comfortable, you can sit here and I won't even talk to you. Come on, everyone has to eat, right? It'll be your chance to be served for once. - I feel a little awkward. - Please, sit. I mean it. Madame. - Oh. Thank you. - Well, don't thank me until you've tried it. - Oh, gosh. Thank you. Wow, it looks nice. - Well, nice is relative. I mean, you should see this place in the summer. It gets chocked full. It takes you a month to get a reservation. - So, why did you buy a vineyard? - I don't know, I just, I love growing things, you know? Nurturing them, caring for them. And then pouring them down people's throats to get them drunk. (both chuckle) Try this. It's from my first run. (speaks foreign language) (Shane chuckles) Okay, um... That's, uh, (clears throat) that's terrible. - No, no, it's not, it's just maybe a little young. - No, it's not a little young, it's corked. Okay, I am going to get us something else. - Oh gosh, you don't have to do that. - Hey, it is my winery, and I'm going to make sure I serve you something decent. Okay. So, Estelle tells me that you are her cousin? - Mm-hm. Were you asking about me? - No. Okay, maybe a little. (chuckles) So? - So, my family and I used to come up here almost every summer, when I was little. My mother and Estelle's mother were really good cooks. And they used to teach us all sorts of things. You know, how to use spices and tricks in the kitchen. Cooking with passion. (Thomas chuckles) - Passion's good. (Shane gasps) I'm sorry, I... - I'm sorry, I just, um, I have to go. - Lexi. Lexi, we haven't eaten. - I know, I'm sorry. - Damnit. (dark atmospheric music) - Do you guys feel like taking a shortcut? It should cut off at least 20 minutes or so. I forgot one of the harnesses in the truck. - Well, I'll get it. - [Matt] Shane! (Matt screams) (Shane gasps) (knocks) (suspenseful orchestral music) (knocks) - It's Estelle. - I'm fine. - She fell off the ladder. - I said I needed help with the painting. - You could have waited. - Well, that could have been days. - Don't blame this on me. - Well, how bad is it? - When I fell, my leg got caught between the rungs. - [Meg] It's a tibial shaft fracture. - I'll be off my feet for a while. - Now I gotta run this place on my own. - [Estelle] Shane's here, she'll help you. - I will and don't worry about it, you just, take care of yourself, okay? And get better. - Don't forget to turn the sign over! - So, they may have to operate and put screws in it to hold it in place, we're trying to figure out whether we can cover it with insurance. - You guys don't have insurance? - It's complicated, everything has to be an issue, right? In the meantime the doctor gave her these pills and said that she's supposed to take one in the day and two at night to help her sleep. - Is she in a lot of pain? - I think so, but she won't admit it. I told her I'd be there in five minutes, look what happened. (sighs) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Mr. Walsh. Didn't see you there. So you're not jogging today? - Does it look like I'm jogging? - I was just making an observation. - Keen observation seeing that I'm (chuckles) not wearing jogging clothes. - Hey, I could take you up sometime still. I mean, I guess I still owe ya. - [Matt] Do you? - Yeah. I mean, we didn't go up that day. - Is that because you helped my wife? Simple question. Did you help my wife? - I don't know what you're talking about. (screams) - On the ground. - Okay just wait, wait. - Get on the ground! - Okay, okay, okay. Okay, just don't do this. - Did you help my wife? - Okay, okay. Look, she came to me the day before we went to the canyon. She just wanted to know alternate routes out of the woods. - [Matt] What else? - Nothing, man, I swear to god. - I have checked every possible route out of this town, and her name doesn't appear anywhere. Why do you think that is? - Man, I don't know! - Where is she? (gun fires) Where did she go? - Some small town in Washington State, man. I don't remember the name, she just gave me cash, and she asked me to buy some ticket in my sister's name. Look, man, this is between you and your wife, so just leave me alone, please. I swear to god, dude, I won't say anything. Just please don't shoot me, please don't... - Oh, I know you won't. - No, no! (gun fires) Shane. - Lexi. Whoa. I can come back. - (sighs) Didn't you knock? - The door was open, I said hello. - Well I didn't hear you. - I thought you did. - [Shane] No, I didn't. - Sorry, I wouldn't have done that to you, then. Um, I heard about your cousin, these are for her. - [Shane] Oh, that's so sweet, thank you. - So, how's she doing? - She's gonna be okay. Meg's upstairs right now trying to get her to take her pills. - Okay, well I'll leave you alone, then. - Okay, well thank you. - You know, unless you'd like me to help you clean up around here? - Oh, no. - No, you know what? It'd be my pleasure. Who wants to stay around here late doing this all by themselves, right? (chuckles) You know, that way you can even boss me around a little. - I'm sorry about how I left the other night. I shouldn't have done that. - You know what? Don't worry about it. If I were you, I would have run as soon as the wine was bad. - It has nothing to do with you. It's, it's, this is just really not a great time for me to get to know anybody. - Look, I'm gonna go out on a limb here. This is gonna sound a little bit crazy, 'cause I don't really know you from Adam but, look, I really like you. (warm piano music) And I don't say that a lot because I haven't really liked anybody in a long time. And I get the feeling that you feel the same but there's something stopping you. So if you tell me what it is, maybe I can help. - It's not your problem. - Then make it my problem. - No, it's just, it doesn't work like that. - [Thomas] Lexi, I can handle it. - [Shane] I don't think you can. - Wow, you really know how to crush a guy's ego. - I don't think you are the kind of guy who has a problem with his ego. (chuckles) - Well, maybe not on the outside, but, on the inside, it's a whole different story. - Is it a good story? - Yeah, it's a great story. (Shane gasps) Look, I didn't mean anything. - Sorry. - Yeah. Me too. Goodnight. Come on. - [Shane] Morning. - Oh, good morning. - [Shane] You're up early. - Yeah, well I went to bed early. - You certainly have a lot going on here. - Yeah well, I mean, in the summer it's, uh... - It's busy. (giggles) I just, I wanted to say I'm sorry, for last night. - You, uh, you said that last night. - I know, I wanted to apologize again. I'm sorry that I haven't told you everything, and I'm sorry that my life is complicated. - You know what? Lexi, I, um... I don't think it's complicated at all. You and me, we can, I mean, we could start fresh. No mysteries, no secrets. - No weeds. - Exactly. (Shane sighs) - My name is not Lexi. - [Thomas] I figured that. - It's Shane Walsh. And up until six weeks ago, I was married to a man named Matthew Walsh. He put me in the hospital three times. I was really young when I met him. And... Back then he was sweet and funny. And I didn't wanna date him, but he kept wining and dining me and filling my head with all these big dreams. I had a lot of debt. I had student loan debt. Credit card debt. And he just one day made it all go away, and I thought, "oh, he's my hero." I was so stupid. And then my parents died, and then he... He was there, he filled that gap. But it turns out he was a really angry man, and I tried to ignore his anger and it got worse, and he said that I was useless and that I should be thankful to be with him. Because nobody else would want me and then, um, he told me that if I divorced him that, he would kill me and himself and anyone that I was close to. (Thomas sighs) (Thomas sighs) - How did you get away? - I faked my own death. I made him think that I got lost hiking. - What about the body? - I'm missing. - And here you are. - Here I am. - Wow. - It's kinda weird, I don't know, do you... Do you think less of me now? - I actually think you're pretty amazing. (Shane chuckles) - I came over here to (chuckles) invite you to dinner, to my house for a date. (Matthew exhales sharply) - I don't know. I mean, I hardly know you. (Shane chuckles) Yes, I'd love to come for dinner, at eight. I'll see you then. - Okay. Thank you. Okay. - Thank you. - Are you sure you're okay? - I am okay. - I know there's a game at the high school, so it's gonna be a slow night but, if you want me to come back... - It will be fine. Meg can totally handle the place on her own. - Well, why don't you guys just close? - [Meg] She might. - [Shane] Well, I'll help her. - Go to your date, Shane. - [Shane] It's not a date. - Yeah? What would you call it? - Um, it's just two friends having dinner. - Well, he thinks it's a date. - How do you know? - Um, he told me. - When? - The very first day that he met you, he said, he liked you and he wanted to get to know you better. - [Shane] And you're just now telling me? - You weren't ready to hear it till now. It's a date. - Whatever. Here, don't forget to take these. - What are you, my mother? - 411 operator. (ominous atmospheric music) - [Matt] I need the phone number and address of a place called Porter's Cafe. - [Woman On Phone] Please hold for the number.

Of course, with my luck, it'll probably need CPR. Thanks. - So have a seat, dinner's almost ready. - Good, I am starved and it smells delicious. Do you need a hand with anything? - No, no no no, I'm fine. Have a seat. You're staring. - Um, actually, I was just... Observing. - Looks like a little more than that. (chuckles) - Do you remember when you were a teenager, how exciting it used to be to be alone in a room with someone? - I think I remember that. (Matthew chuckles) - You know, I um, (clears throat) I remember my hands getting so sweaty I'd have to rub them off on each pant leg just in case I'd get a chance to hold her hand. - Aww. I used to (chuckles) make sure that my breath was constantly fresh just in case somebody wanted to give me a kiss. - Um, so how long do you think we have before, um, before dinner's ready? - Um, just a few minutes. - Oh, one second, you, have something on your chin. - What? What? Is it gone? - Looks like, um, flour or something right there. - What? No no no, I didn't use flour. - You have a bit of flour right, um, right there. And you have a little bit of flour right... And you have some right there. And you have some right here. (peaceful orchestral music) I have to ask you something. - What? - Do you think dinner's ready? (chuckles) (moody jazz music) - [Man On TV] Were you a friend of my brother's? - [Man On TV] I've never met him. - Hi. How are you feeling? - You don't have to keep asking me every hour. - I'm concerned. Take these. - You're funny. - Here's your water. You were right, I should have closed the place, nobody came. - Well, you never know. - Hey. I'm gonna go to the bank and do the deposit. You want anything? - You're good to me. - Don't get used to it. I'll take that. - Thank you. - [Man On TV] I suppose you've not heard of Eugene either. - [Woman On TV] Just who are you, what do you want? - [Man On TV] Nevermind who I am, where's Reynolds? - [Woman On TV] I told you, I don't know him. Now will you get out of here and leave me alone? (suspenseful atmospheric music) - Do you remember taking this picture for George Reynolds? This gentleman's a friend of his and would like his address. We have no call on him and he's willing to pay $20 for it. - [Man On TV] That's the paper we used last year. - [Man On TV] Of course you understand we usually don't give out information about our clients. - [Man On TV] I know, you're a couple of high-class fellas. - [Man On TV] Thank you, revealing anything confidential is against ethics of our establishment. - [Man On TV] That's right, honesty is the best policy. - [Man On TV] Of course, but in your case, in as much as your personal friend Mr. Reynolds. - [Man On TV] Thanks, I knew you'd come through. - [Man On TV] Here it is, we don't have his address. He must have called for the picture. - [Man On TV] But he couldn't have been a very good friend of yours, sir, because his name is not George Reynolds. (muffled clunks) (suspenseful music) - Meg? Are you alright? Who's there? - Estelle? - I'm sorry, who are you? - I'm looking for Shane Walsh. Your door was unlocked and I saw the light on, so I thought I'd come up and maybe find her. - Shane? I'm sorry, I don't know who you're talking about. - It's alright, Estelle. I'm a friend. She told me she was coming here and I haven't heard from her for quite some time, so I got concerned. - [Man On TV] There's nothing can be done now. - I'm afraid I have awfully terrible news to tell her. - What news? - Matthew Walsh, her husband, committed suicide. - She said he'd probably do something like that. I would have done it myself if I had the chance. (sighs) - Well, she's a very wealthy woman now. I need to find her. - Who are you again? - I know all about her faking her death. Now you must understand, Estelle, I need to know where she is, I'm here to protect her. - Um... - Shane's a free woman now, she needs to know that. Just tell me where she is. - I don't know where she is, she was here, but she left a few days ago, I don't know where she went. - Are you sure you don't know where she went? I think you do, I think you do. (Estelle screams) (intense strings) (grunts) (muffled screams) (gun fires) - [Woman On TV] What different does it make? You can't talk to him now, I told you, the man's dead. - [Man On TV] All I did was notarize about the same. But that piece of paper could have proven that. Philips didn't commit suicide, he was murdered. And that's why (Matt sighs) poisoned me. (phone vibrates) - Meg, hi. Yeah. Hold on. - Hello? - I, uh... Gave her pills. And then I went to the bank to do the deposit. And on the way back I was gonna get her this, this ice cream that she likes. But it was closed, so... I just came home and... I called for her. But she didn't answer and so, I went, to the stairs. And she was lying at the bottom, with her pills around her. I guess she got, maybe get some water. Or maybe she, was looking for me 'cause she needed me. I shouldn't have left her. - No, no. It was an accident. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Look, I um... I talked to the sheriff and, he needs you to come down to the hospital to fill out some forms. - Do you wanna come with us? - The breakfast rush is gonna start. - [Shane] Meg, we're closed. - Can you just let me pretend? Just let me pretend. - Let's go, okay? Come on. (suspenseful orchestral music) - We're not quite open yet. - Hi, um, I have a delivery for somebody named Shane? Is he around? - That's a she and you just missed her, I'll take it. - Oh. (chuckles) Sorry, but this is a special delivery. I have to deliver a personal message with it as well. Oh, I'm running late. You happen to have an address on her? (ominous orchestral music) (glass smashes) (sniffs passionately) (grunts) (Thomas sighs) - You want some company? - I'm not sure. (sighs) Can you maybe come by a little later or something? - Yeah, I can make dinner again, eight o'clock? - Okay. Thanks. (suspenseful orchestral music) (truck starts) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gasps) - Impressive. You had this whole secret life thing going on, didn't you, Shane? Is it still Shane? - Matt. I was confused. I didn't know what I was doing. - Let's go right to the goodbyes. (kettle whistles) (percussive orchestral music) - Thomas, my husband's... Thomas, (sighs) Thomas. Oh my god. Oh, thank god, wake up, wake up. - Shane! I know you're in there! (laughs) Oh, I almost caught you too. Get out here, Shane. I gave you everything. I gave you a life. And what do you throw it away on, huh? What do you throw it away on? Nothing. I said get out here, Shane, do you hear me? Get out here or I will kill him! Do you hear me? - Matt, don't hurt him anymore, please, we're just friends. - I know what he is. - I'll go back with you, maybe I made a mistake, maybe I, maybe I should have tried to work it out with you, make it work, I'm sorry. I didn't know how much you cared about me. And now I understand, how much you love me. - [Matt] I wish I could believe you. (gun fires) (percussive orchestral music) - [Shane] Oh, god. (suspenseful orchestral music) - I loved you, Shane. - Yeah. Yeah, I could tell, Matt, every time you hit me. - Why would you say that? - Because it's true! - You made mistakes. Then I'd get angry. Those are my mistakes. But believe me, I always wanted you to be perfect, so that we could be perfect, but you never listen. I would have done anything for you, Shane, anything. - Okay, then go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead, Matt, shoot me, please. I died the day I married you. - Don't talk to me like that. - Why? What, are you scared? Come on, Matt, be a real man, shoot me. Go ahead and do it. - You do love me. You do love me. Yes, you do. (flesh squelches) (Matt groans) (ominous tones) (melancholic piano music) Shane. Shane. - Shane. (chuckles) You okay? - Yeah. - Thank you. (sighs) Lot in thought. (ominous chord) (peaceful orchestral music)
