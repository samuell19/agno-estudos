Come on. Come on. Come and get it. Come and get it, Milo! Is that confidence, or what? A matter of good breeding, Milo. Yeah, you're Mr. Perfect. You'll probably end up assassinating the President. You have one warped sense of humor, you know that? [both laugh] [together] Blanchard. Jenny? What? Blanchard's here. Damn it, Bill. You know I can't see him. Will you get rid of him for me, please? What are brothers for, huh? Milo. - [screaming] - Jenny... [continues, indistinct] No! Let go of me! I'm sorry about this. I didn't mean to... - Just give me a minute. I can explain this. - Go away! Listen to me! What the hell do you think you're doing, huh? - Bill, I know how this probably looks. - Get out of here. [Blanchard] All right. Look... - Something very weird is going on here. - No shit, Sherlock. [Blanchard] I have to talk to you. - I didn't know you had to hide in a closet to talk. - She's playing games with me. - [Blanchard] I'm serious. - [Jenny] Liar! Jen? Bill? David, why do you keep bothering my daughter? Mrs. Whitney, I-I just want to talk to her... - Please, please. - Just... just leave. Come on, Blanchard. Look, I... What's going on here, guys? Oh, it was nothing, Dad. It's okay, Daddy. I thought we weren't going to be seeing David Blanchard anymore. Yes, Daddy. You should be getting ready. You know Judge Carter will be there tonight. I'm almost ready now. Oh, Bill. Wasn't that Milo outside? Uh, yeah. Yeah, he was just going to take me to the... the game. - You okay? - Sure. So you want to tell me what's going on with Blanchard? I don't know. Jealous, I guess. He just wasn't the right sort for me. Could you zip me up, Billy? Something wrong? Uh, no. No, it's just a little damp, that's all. Well, I'm not taking another shower. Yeah. Look, I'm-I'm really sorry that I'm going to miss your coming out. What a coincidence the way things turn out, huh? Yeah. Come on. Basketball's much more important than a stupid coming-out party. Besides, I've already been dating three years. Joke. Yeah. [girl] We are number one. We are number one. We are number one. - All right! - [students cheering] Let's hear it for the best player, our hero, Bill Whitney. - All right! Isn't he wonderful? - [students cheering] Eat your heart out, girls. We are number one! Whoo! They're using their athletic ability to get the votes... - Of the childish morons in this audience. - [students booing] Looks to me like you just lost the moron vote, Marty. All right. Hey! Let's carry on with the debate. [Milo] Candidate Whitney, you may respond concerning the proposed dress code. [student shouting, indistinct] Yeah. Well... - [boy] Hello? - [girl] Come on. We should have a dress code, I guess. And I think we should follow it, and... - [students murmuring] - [bill] Most possible... Strict... - We poss... we possibly can. - [boy] Speak up! [girl] Louder! [students laughing] What I mean is, if we could prove to the administration... that a dress code really is a problem... I mean, just imagine everybody walking around in those idiotic clothes... like Marty over here is wearing right now. And I mean everybody. It'd make them think that they were some kind of a... a conspiracy. She's bad news, man. [chuckling] The debate and the game. I nailed the guy who was a shoo-in for the election. Well, I'm glad to see you're allowing yourself some success without sabotaging it. Let me ask you, how do you feel about your family now, in light of all these recent victories? - My family? - Yes. Um... Nothing. I mean, I don't think about them, they don't think about me. We're just... we're just one big happy family. - 'Cept for a little incest and psychosis. - [man laughs] Look, I know you're being facetious, but I think you really believe that. No. No, I don't. I don't. But we're getting along much better now. Really. Hey. Let's not waste our time bullshitting. All right, all right. They don't approve of me, okay? Th-they don't accept my friends. They don't talk to me like they do Jenny. Hell, they don't even look like me. Now I told you that teenagers sometimes feel alienated from those closest to them. Alienated. - I think I was adopted. - [chuckles] - Don't you think that sounds a little bit paranoid? - No. No, I've never been paranoid. Just a little bit paranoid, Bill. Within normal ranges. You know, you really deserve what's going to happen to you. What's going to happen? You're going to make a wonderful contribution to society. ♪♪ [classical] Jenny?

Uh, Jenny... I'm sorry, really. I just came in here to get this. Get out of here. - [both laughing] - Rocky, that's beautiful. [continues, indistinct] - That's the most incredible crop we've ever raised. - I know. [Mom] Rocky, you've done a terrific job. Bill? There he is. The future Student Body President of Beverly Hills Academy. We're so excited about our party for Judge Carter next week. - Well, um, I'm gonna go go to the beach today. - Oh. When will you be back, son? - Well, that depends on if we go out after... - Don't be late, darling. Oh, I love that one. Look at that, it's really good. - This is the best crop you've ever grown, rocky. - Absolutely perfect. [squeaking sound] [laughing] I love you, you know. And if you really love me, you'll get us invited to Ted Ferguson's party. I can't believe we were left out. Look, he's over there. Come on, Billy baby, couldn't you go talk to him? Please? - Die, aliens, die! - Hey! - Hey, hey! Jesus, goddamn it! - My hair! Give me that! Hey! [spitting out sand] Hey! Hey, get back here. Don't get too hot. [angry sigh] Hey!

So, uh, you know of anything that's going on this week? - This week? - [snickers] I can't think of anything. - Well, if you do, let me know, huh? - I'll send you a telegram. [girl laughing] - Yeah, let me know, huh? - It's my pleasure. - Bill? [Panting] - Hey, Blanchard. What's up? I've got something you gotta hear. - You were out of line with my sister. - Oh, God, no. Look. I'm serious. This is very important. [panting] - What are you talking about? - Look, not here. Just come with me to the pier, okay? Please? Come on. I think what you'll find in paragraph ten will excite... - Dad, something's wrong with one of my earrings. - Oh, Jenny. Oh, hello, Judge Carter. How is our newest confirmed member of society... - this lovely afternoon? - Oh, I'm fine. It's my earring that's not doing so well. I must say, young lady, you certainly added beauty... to an altogether beautiful coming-out party, don't you agree, Jim? Prettiest girl there, your honor. Please, be seated. It's right in the back by the clasp. Oh, yes. There seems to be something caught in there. Top secret, eh, Blanchard? [chuckles] - [Dad on tape] Everybody in? - [Jenny] Yes, Dad. [Dad] All right, girls, don't forget your seat belts. Wait a minute. That's my family. All right, Bill. I know you're going to be a little upset about this, but, I put a voice-actuated tape recorder underneath your parents' car... - And a microphone in Jenny's ear. - You bugged my family? - [continues, indistinct] - Just listen to the tape. Listen. [Mom] I remember my own coming out. I was so excited. [Jenny] Then you can do it with women as well as men? - [Mom] Of course. - [Dad] You know the schedule. First dine, then copulation. Someone your own age first. Then with your mother and me. Then in comes the host. You'll be ready. [Jenny] I could hardly keep a straight face when Bill apologized to me... - about not being able to make it. - Don't be concerned about your brother, Jen. He's too busy with things in his own world to worry about ours. [clicks off, tape whirring] [girl] You lucked out, Jen. Ted Ferguson is really cute for a first partner. - Ted Ferguson? Ted Ferguson! - Yeah, Jenny and Ferguson. That's just the beginning. Here, listen. [girl] Wow, your boobs look totally sexy. Guys are gonna pop high ones the second they see you. - [Jenny] I'm a little nervous, though. - [girl] It's fun. Relax, Jenny. Go with it. It's so much fun to see how far you can stretch. The hotter and wetter you get, the more you can do. It's great! - It's a microphone. - Let me see. David Blanchard's been bothering my daughter recently. Following her around. Things like that. He's a real electronics wizard. Is that so, Jim? [Jenny moaning] Oh, Ted, you were wonderful. [man] Don't get too cocky, Ted. You know what I mean? [Jenny] Oh. Oh, Ted. Oh, my God. - [girl] Whoa! - [Jenny] Is that him? [moaning, laughing continue] - [man] Hold on. What are you doing? - [girls laughing] - [man yelling] - [girl laughing] - [girl] God, this is excellent. - [man continues yelling] - What the hell are you doing? - [man screaming] Bill, now, come on. It's bullshit, man. You rigged it. You've been living with these people all your life and you didn't know anything? Shut up! - Give me this! Give me! - Bill! - Blanchard! - Come on. Don't do it. Come on. Here's your stupid recorder. Bill? Wait! [door bell rings] - Dr. Cleveland, you gotta listen to this tape. - Something happen at home? - I'm not crazy. This is real. I can't believe it. - Uh... Well, I can't right now, but I'll be glad to listen to it later. - No, no, now! Please? Please? - Billy? Trust me, I will call you just as soon as I listen to it, or I'll see you tomorrow. - No, no, no. No. - It's okay, Billy. Give me the tape. You still don't trust me? Are you still afraid of me? Okay, it's up to you, Billy. If you want to bring it tomorrow, that's okay. Look, I-I don't know why I'm afraid, but I... Doctor, it's very important. I understand. Listen to it. Okay, now listen. Yesterday, after you left the beach, I heard something. It involved my parents, my sister and Ted Ferguson. He's not inviting us, is he? - I knew it. - Just listen to me for a minute here. Stop worrying about that stupid party. It may seem stupid to you, but I want to go. Is that all you think about? Parties and social status? If you're having problems because you're so big-headed and selfish, no wonder no one ever invites us anywhere. I don't believe this. I'm trying to tell you something and all you're doing is giving me shit. Oh! Oh, fine, fine. That's just fine. If that's how you feel about me, well, I'm just glad I know it now rather than later. I don't know, Billy. Maybe we should start seeing other people. Wait a minute. Shauna? Shauna? Shauna, wait... - Oh, man. - Hey, Bill... Milo. Hey, dude, I see you got... I'm very concerned about you, Billy. - You listen to the tape? - You're aware, aren't you, what you're doing is illegal? What about what they were doing? My father and sister and my mother... Together. - [Dad] Everybody in? - [Mom] All in. [Dad] All right, girls, don't forget the seat belts. Fast forward a little bit. [clicks, tape whirring] [Mom] I remember my own coming out. God, I was so excited. [Jenny] You mean I can dance with anyone I want? - [Mom] Of course. - I-I don't understand. [Dad] You know the schedule. First we dine, then introductions. Then you'll be presented. No. No. [stammering] [Jenny] Oh, my God. It's so exciting. [Dad] Don't worry, dear. We'll be there to help you. [Jenny] I felt bad that Bill couldn't come. I hope he doesn't feel left out. [Dad] We're very proud of your brother. It's unfortunate that he couldn't be with us. That's not what I heard. [clicks, tape whirring] - [clicks] - [people laughing] Bill? Billy, people are what they are. Now you have to learn to accept that. And you have to learn to accept society's rules of privacy. If you don't follow the rules, Billy, bad things happen. Now some people make the rules, some people follow the rules. It's a question of what you're born to. - I really hate giving you drugs, Billy. - What? - I don't believe this. - You can always trust me. You've got to believe me. Blanchard? Yeah, look, I need another copy of the tape. - No, it can't wait. Ple... - Yeah, the corner of Roxbury and Wilshire, right. Okay. Hurry, okay? Hurry! [door slams] Blanchard. [police radio, indistinct] Is he dead? [engine starts, tires squeal] [dog barking in distance] Hey, this isn't a garage sale. - Look, officer, he was a friend. - Look, you can't just wander into the scene of an accident. - Look, officer, something is definitely wrong here. - Get the hell out of here. - You don't understand. - Get the hell out of here. Guess what? A telegram came for you. Listen, Jenny, something bad happened today. Oh, come on. Don't you want to open it? Go ahead. Read it. "Mr. William Whitney, "you're cordially invited to a party given at the residence of Theodore S. Ferguson... Wow. "This evening, the Fifteenth of October at 8:00 P.M. Cordially, Ted 'The Tycoon' Ferguson." Sounds like some bash, son. But be careful on the drinking and driving. Oh, that home is just beautiful. Maurice Arnaud did most of the interiors, and he says it's his best work to date. Uh, um... You guys don't understand. I'm trying to tell you something. We know all about the, um, the automobile accident, son. - It's terrible, just terrible. - Oh, my... Just awful. Wait a minute, I-I... I don't think you quite understand here. David's dead. - Jenny? - I know. I'm really going to miss him. That's it? You're really going to miss him? I know the guy freaked out after you dumped him, but, come on, still... Listen, I'd rather not talk about it, please? So, what are you going to wear? - You mean to the funeral? - No, you weirdo. To the Ferguson's party. Yeah, right. Ferguson. - ♪♪ [dance] - [people chattering] [girl laughing] Yeah, come on. [chattering fades] - You're name is Clarisa, isn't it? - Mm-hmm. Clarisa Carlyn. So where's Shauna? Well, I didn't expect to see her here, if that's what you mean. That is who you go with, right? - Do you know my Mom's maiden name too? - Real or adopted? Bill. Bill, what happened with Blanchard? Milo. Ferguson invited you? Come on. Give me a break. I'm not in the mood, all right? - Whatever turns you on. - At least I don't turn tricks to get my kicks. Oh, Milo. - That was totally uncalled for. - Have you seen her mother? Wait, wait. Listen, listen. What happened today with Blanchard? Hey, I asked you about Blanchard. You saw it, didn't you? I can't deal with that right now, okay? I gotta go. Well, Billy. We need to talk. Guess you got my telegram. Sorry it was so much at the last minute. I wanna talk to you about Blanchard and my sister, Jenny. I thought they broke up. He wasn't really her type anyway. Don't be so intense. Just relax. Enjoy. I want to know what happened to Blanchard. And I want to know what you did to my sister at her coming out. You know the schedule. First we dined, then I fucked your sister, then everybody else got so turned on, they fucked her too. And as far as bagel-breath Blanchard goes, I ran that low-rent fool right into a pole. That's a pretty busy week, don't you think? You are stupid! You make waves, Whitney, you're going to drown. [guests laughing] - [girl] Hey, let's go. - [boy] That's a stupid place to fall. Wet dreams? You're crazy. You know what you just did? No. But I know what I'm about to do. Don't bother. It's his party. Someday, it's going to be my party. You know, you're in danger of losing this button here. It's only held on by one thread. Oops. Told you. - You're weird. - Wanna go get soaked? - Well, sure. - [laughs] Better get out of these wet things. Mmm. You seem so fresh. Uh, are you sure no one's going to come in? I'm all alone. [giggles] Lean machine, jelly bean. Try to run now. Clarisa? What's the matter, Billy? You, uh, you were in a funny position. Oh, Billy. You're so sweet. I wonder when exactly you lost your virginity. [Giggles] - See, that's Bill's Jeep. - It is. I can't believe he would do this to me. Oh, come on, Shauna. It's better you find out now rather than later, right? - Wrong. - God, what a bitch that Clarisa Carlyn is. - Can you imagine what's going on? - All right, all right. How do your like you tea? Cream? Sugar? Or do you want me to pee in it? [scoffs] You're a class act, Clarisa. Oh, I'm so mad I could just scream. - Who's that? - I don't know. - We better get out of here. - Mm-hmm. Oh, shit. Clarisa? Clarisa? Home a little early tonight, don't you think so, mother? Has that brain of yours finally gone completely numb? [gagging] - Mrs. Carlyn, Bill Whitney. - [continues gagging] Come on, mother. Out! Out! Clarisa, what are you doing? Lighten up, Billy boy. Drink your tea before you drool. So what's with her? She does things I don't like. I've never known anyone like you. It's about time you did, honey bunny. It's getting late. [dog barking in distance] - Shauna? - So are you happy now? - What do you mean? - What a bitch that Clarisa Carlyn is. You think that you can do anything you want and get away with it. - Look, just calm down and let me explain. - Was she a good fuck? Because that's all you're really interested in. Isn't it, Billy? No, look, Shauna, let... um... Oh, Billy, how could you? Uh, look, I... Shauna! [engine starts] Yeah, right there, Dad. That's good. - What's this? - Oh, God, bill. Is that what I think it is? That's a really disgusting thing to bring into Mom and Dad's bedroom. I don't know what's going on here, but I don't appreciate it. - Calm down, Bill. - Some of us have to get to school on time. You know, you look really nice in a tie. Don't you think so, Jim? Yes, yes he does. Knock it off here! Why? Why are you guys doing this to me, huh? - Don't be so paranoid. - Wait... - I'm not paranoid. - Don't be like that. Come on, Bill. Now calm down. You know, you'll make such a great contribution to society. You'll... you'll do our whole family proud. Man, you guys disgust me. - Wha... - Bill, don't be disrespectful to your mother. My mother? God knows where my mother is. I won't tolerate this language from you, young man. Fuck you, butthead. Bill! How dare you use the "F" word to your father. Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Mom. Prefer the word, copulation? [gasps] You stay away from me. Don't touch me. [Mom] Do something with him. You don't have to do anything anymore, because I'm moving out. You can't do that. [bill] Blanchard. He looks really weird. Not like himself at all. I think that's what they always look like. They, um, must have had to do a lot of reconstructive stuff on him. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Bill? It's imperative that I talk with you. - [Gasps] It's about your parents, about him, about some of the things that have been happening here lately. Society. - What-what do you mean, society? - Not here. Meet me tonight at Franklin Canyon, about 9:00, at the gate. Wait a minute. Petrie? Petrie? Hey! [engine starts] Petrie! Hey? Petrie? Hey. [cracking sound] [cracking sound] Who's there? [gasps] Oh! [grunts] - [man laughing] - [footsteps receding] Who are you? [gasps, grunts] - Clarisa, what are you doing here? - I live here. Yeah, look, I just saw Petrie with his neck cut. Poor baby. I hope he didn't make a mess. Where's your phone, huh? This isn't the one. I don't think we need the lab to tell us there's no blood. Look, officer, this isn't the car. They-they must have taken it. I don't know. They? What are you hopped up on? Look, I'm telling you, someone killed Martin Petrie. Up against the car, kids. Look, this isn't the car, okay? It was a Volvo, not whatever this is. There was a dead person in it. Is it really that boring being rich? You going to frisk me too? I guess you're just naturally fucked up, huh? Next time I see you, it will be a lot less pleasant. What now? You can go home with me. - I'm not in the mood, all right? - That's not what I meant. - [boy] All right. - [banging sound] All right. Hey! We'll begin the Presidential Debate in a Moment. Bill, why didn't you come home last night? Mom and Dad are really upset. Jenny, do you have anything to tell me? What do you want me to say? Come on. I swear... I swear it'll be just between you and me. Just-just tell me the truth. - About what? - You know what. Bill, I'm really worried about you. [sighs] Yeah. Sure you are. [Milo] All right, quiet down. Thank you. Where's Petrie? It's strange that Martin Petrie isn't here. He's never late. He's won every attendance award. - But he's not coming here. - [students murmuring] No, please. David-David Blanchard's death was no accident. David Blanchard tried to tell me about the society that kills... To keep its existence a secret. They killed Blanchard. Martin Petrie tried to tell me about-about this society, but they got to him before I did. I saw Petrie, last night in Franklin Canyon... murdered. - [all gasping] - [student] What? Martin Petrie is dead. [students laughing] Would someone like to tell me what's going on here? - I had car trouble. - [laughter increases] Nice speech, Whitney. [laughing] Bill... - Bill? Bill, we gotta talk. - Leave me alone, Milo. I fucked you up, man, and I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd take it this far. What do you mean? I mean, I was the one who put the shrunken head in your locker... And the sex doll in your Jeep, but I didn't think you'd flip out. You! You, Petrie, Ferguson. Who else was in on this, huh? Who else, asshole? Just give me a chance to explain. I'm trying to tell you, you crazy son of a bitch, but you got your own answers, as usual. I'm not in on anything, but I followed you to Franklin Canyon last night. I saw Petrie and Ferguson coming out of the woods. Petrie was wrapped in a blanket. Then some old station wagon showed up. Then an old Ford. The whole thing was weird. You-you saw it? I only followed you because of the way you were acting. Wait a minute. Then-then it's not me. I'm not going crazy. Right. Hey. Why the dolls and stuff? I don't know. You just got me angry. You know, I'm your best friend when it suits you. Guess I do go a little overboard. - I'm sorry. - [chuckles] It's all right, man. It's all right. Milo, I, uh, I don't know what kind of trouble this is gonna be. I'm with you. [squeaks brakes, shuts off engine] [car door slams] [shuts off engine] [crickets chirping] [muttering] Why doesn't it surprise me that you're all here like this? Thank God you're here. You nearly spoiled everything. [vehicle approaching] You know, we've been worried sick about you. Look, I would really love to stay and shoot the shit, but I got a big day tomorrow, so I'm-I'm gonna go to bed. - [gasps] - No, wait. No, wait a minute, Bill. We want to talk to you for a second. I-I don't think so. Wait, what are you doin'? Let go of me. Let go! - Bill. Bill. Bill! - What do you think you're doing? What? I'm sorry. You know how I hate to give you drugs. You can't do this to me. I have rights, okay? I'm almost 18! Thanks, Cleve. [hissing, increasing in volume] [starts engine] [doors, stretcher clattering] - [woman on P.A.] Maintenance... - [phone ringing] Excuse me. Miss! Bill... uh, William Whitney. What room's he in? [sighing] Whitney. I don't see anything here about a Whitney. [sighs deeply] I know he's here. He was just brought in. Well, just a minute. - [door opening, closing] - [woman on P.A.] Dr. Oswald, 5493. Dr. Oswald, 5493. - William Whitney? - Yeah. - Are you a relative? - Yes! - Well, you have to go to the morgue, then. - The morgue? - Mm-hmm. - He isn't dead! He just got here. - Well, I'm sorry. - No, no, no! No, no! You're not sorry, there's been a mistake! Now, please. We don't want to have to call security. He can't be! [siren wailing] [car door closing] - [rushing sound] - [bill] Blanchard, what's up? [Blanchard] I've got something you've got to hear. [Dr. Cleveland] I'm sorry. You know how I hate to give you drugs. [Jenny] He just wasn't the right sort for me. [Dad] You know the schedule. First we dine, then copulation. - With someone your own age first. - [ted] Bill, I fucked your sister. I mean, everybody else got so turned on, they fucked her too. [Mom] You know you'll make such a great contribution to society. [man, indistinct] Do you know anything about this? [boy] Aah! Aah! No! [panting] Blanchard? - [boy] No! - [clattering, struggling] - [doctor] Let's get this one out of here. - [nurse] Yes, doctor. - Easy, easy, easy. Hold this. - [Boy] Ow! Ow! - [whimpering continues] - Disconnect the cord. [doctor continues, indistinct] [grunting, retching] [chuckles] [chuckles] That's right, roll out the red carpet. Bill Whitney never disappoints, huh? [chortles] Ha! They said you were dead. Things are just the way they seem. Only more so, Milo. - [chuckles] - What happened? - What did they do to you? - Nothin'! I'm here, aren't I, huh? I won, Milo. I'm free. They couldn't handle Whitney the wonder boy. [Laughing] Bullshit. It's a setup! - Look, they even brought your Jeep here. - Come on! They just want me to be happy. [giggles] Bill, you're officially dead. Come on! Can't you see they're setting you up for something? Paranoid? I'm not paranoid. All my fears are real. - Come on. - [starting engine] Let's party, jelly bean. Hmm? Where's your Mom? - Or was she in on this too? - Why don't you come upstairs? I want to be a bad girl for you. Oh, bad little girl. Is that right, huh? Bad little girl? Oh. Huh? You want to get rough? - Things aren't the way they seem, Billy. - Oh, yeah? Why don't you stay here awhile? - Stay here awhile. - [panting] Quit it. It doesn't work anymore. - Don't go home, Billy. - Don't go home? Are you kidding? They want me home! It's time to party hearty! [door opens, closes] Where are we going? What's the plan? Plan? Are you kiddin'? [starts engine] Aah! Shit! [grunts] Mrs. Carlyn! Don't do that! All right. Get out of the car. [gasps] Okay. We're gonna take a little ride. - [slams door] - But don't touch the hair. [starts engine] [woman grunts] [man] Shh! - [clicks light switch] - [rustling, distant shouting] [whispering, indistinct] [man, whispering] Where did he go? - [man, laughing] - [woman] Shh! [man, whispering] I hear him. Mom? Dad? [beeping] - Fuck, Mom. - [woman screaming] [car doors closing] [laughing, indistinct] [man, whispering] Keep it down. [panting, sighing] Okay. Mom? Dad? I'd like to have a little chat with you. [grunting, shouting] [chattering, laughing] - [Mom clapping] - [various people] Yes, yes. Wonderful. Wonderful! Everyone was just wonderful. [woman] Oh, thank you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Judge Carter. [choking, panting] - [chuckling] My dear, dear... - Ohh. Ah! You were both absolutely brilliant. - [giggling] - Oh, thank you. Well done. Well done indeed. Effective. Efficient. - Oh! - And, to say the very least, entertaining? [crowd laughing] I do love the... smell of the hunt. And the taste of the shunt. - What's goin' on? - You see, Bill. It's like this: [chuckling] There's no business like show business. [all laughing] - Who are you? - Oh, I am not your mother. Jesus, Bill. You never were one of us. [laughing] Who are you? You almost understand, don't you, Bill? You're a different race from us. A different species. A different class. You're not one of us! You have to be born in the society. - Alien scum. - [laughing] No. No, we're not from outer space, or anything like that. We have been here... as long as you have. It's a matter of... good breeding, really. - [choking] Alien scum! - [coughing] [car approaching] [car doors slamming] Good evening, miss. [chattering, chuckling] [groaning] [groaning continues] Clarisa! Where have you been? You're late! Come. You've done very well, Jim. I'm pleased to be able to contribute. Anything for society. You too, young man. You have a bright future ahead of you. We may have an internship for you this summer, in Washington. [chuckles, exhales] Come on. Come on, Mrs. Carlyn. You're gonna be my date. Jenny's going to Radcliffe. She'll tour Europe first, of course. Oh, Nanny, Nanny, you are such a lucky woman. Jenny is a real beauty. She possesses such... natural poise. [chuckles] Yes, Jim and I both derive a great deal of pleasure from her. - Don't we, darling? - [clattering] [whimpering, shouting] Ladies and gentlemen, tonight... we have a doubleheader! - Blanchard. - [whispering] Yeah. [raucous laughing] After the first shunting, we'll have that special treat we've been hearing so much about. A wonderful specimen, in his prime, nurtured by Jim and Nan in their very own home. [laughing wickedly] [Blanchard] Get it off. Help! [groaning continues] [gasps, chokes] Keep your eye on Blanchard, Billy boy... 'cause you're next. [Blanchard] You're hurting me! What are you doing? [sobbing] Oh, God! Please! [crowd growling, chattering] [screams] Let go of me! [slurping] [Blanchard moaning] Jim? Jenny? - [Jenny] Good-bye, David. - [chuckles] - [moaning] - [gagging] [billy moaning] Stop it! You're not getting a taste for these pathetic animals, are you? Don't worry! You'll get your share. We're all gonna get our share. - What the fuck's going on? - Didn't you know, Billy boy? The rich have always sucked off low-class shit like you. There it is. There's the house. Hey! Hey, what are you doing in there? This is a private party. And private property. It's members only. - We're invited! - Oh, you're invited? - Who's that? - This is my mother! [snorts] That's your... Hair! Hair, Mrs. Carlyn! [guard] Wait a minute... [groaning] [chattering, chuckling] [Cleveland] He's good and pliable, your honor! [woman laughing] Oh, my lord. [cackling] Oh, look. Look! A beauty mark! Pretty, isn't it? Please. - [growls, munches] - [woman] Ah, yes! And now, we'll get to the bottom... Oh, God! - Of this! - [screaming] [growling, moaning] [laughing] Whoo! [Clarisa] Run, Billy! I love you. [continues laughing] Billy! [Cleveland] Where are you? [chortling] Where are you, Billy? Anyone around my base is "I-T," it. It's show time, Billy! You want to play, huh? You want to play? [laughing] [panting] You! You! [chuckles wickedly] Let me give you a hand, Bill. [wicked laughter] - [slurping, dripping sound] -Mom? Oh, Billy. How sweet of you... To come here to me! - [sighing] - If you have any edible fantasies... you'd like to indulge in, Billy, now's the time. [laughing] [flatulence] Uh, well, son, I guess you're right. I am a butthead. [laughs hysterically] Hey, hey. Hey, Bill? [flatulence] [laughing continues] [screams] [laughs] It's just another hang-up, Billy. [gurgling sound] ♪♪ ["Eton Boat Song," instrumental] [laughing, chattering] - No way! - Ohh! ♪♪ [continues] Stop it. I don't want to... [guffawing] Hi-ho, everybody! Here comes Billy! Let go of me! Stop! Dinner is served. Billy on the half-shell! Billy... Leave her alone! [scoffs] Oh-ho, well, well, well. Look what we have here. Are you going to rescue the young maiden, Billy? - Something like that. - [chuckles] You and me, man-to-man. [giggles] Well, well. A slave revolt. [continues laughing] I love it. You gotta save the girl. It's so cute! Billy, don't! You'll only make it worse. - Shut up, Clarisa. - Jim and Nan, where the hell are ya? [digestive rumblings] [bones cracking] [coughing, gasping] I've got to pull myself together. A beauty mark. [chuckles] [coughs, chokes] I'm getting too old for this. Nan! Jim! Hey, come on, you guys! Knock it off, will ya? You have got to come downstairs. - You've got to see this! - [Jim] Be right out. - We're changing. - Oh, really? Into what? [laughs uproariously] Members of society... hailing from Beverly Hills, with lineage dating from Julius Caesar... and Genghis Khan. The Master of the Hunt, the Champion of the Shunt... Ted "The Tycoon" Ferguson! [cheering, applauding] And, in this corner, from nowhere in particular, Bill "The Bastard" Whitney. Gentlemen, begin! - Begin! - [crowd cheering, jeering] Is everybody ready for the big shunt of the night? Hey, Ferguson... [billy grunts] - More? More? - Yeah, yeah, yeah! Shunt him! Shunt him! Shunt the little bastard! Bill! Bill! Bill! See this arm, Bill? You'll get very familiar with it. [grunts] [man] Whoo-hoo! C'mon, boy! Stop! No! [shrieking] Shit! [Gagging] Is that all ya got? Huh? Come on, Gumby. Give me your best sh... - [grunts] - All right, Billy. The game's over. I told you, Whitney. We don't lose. Ever. [Slurping] Yes! Don't even touch him! Goddamn! [man] What's going on? No! [groaning in pain] [man] No. No! [gurgling] [girl] God, he's turned him inside out. [man] Don't touch it or you'll be killed! [grunting] Clarisa! Bill! Come on, man. You'll never get away with this. [whimpering] Don't count on it. Butthead. Come on! Come on! Whoo! [Milo] Get out of the way! [slurping sounds] [judge] Well, Dr. Cleveland. It looks as though I may have an opening in Washington next summer. - Know what I mean? - Mm. Mm.
