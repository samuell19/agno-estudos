[CHURCH BELLS RINGING] [HISSING] Papa. [WHISPERING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Rosa. Rosa. Rosa! [SHOUTS IN ITALIAN] [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] [EXCLAIMS] [BOTH SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [CROWD EXCLAIMING] [SCREAMING] [ALL EXCLAIMING] [CROWD APPLAUDING] EDDIE: So that's how Mom and Dad got married. It was incredibly romantic. At least the way Dad tells it, it was. Mr. Barbariccia, the butcher's son, was very angry. He swore an oath of vengeance. Dad said it was only on the boat to England that he discovered every paradise has its serpent. Mum Sibilla, my Gran, she knows all about Satan. She even met him once. She said he wasn't half as clever as the Pope, or her. In those days, Dad pitched his tent wherever the work was, but it was during the rainy season that things started to get crowded. Ciao. [GROANS] Mama! EDDIE: First there was Bruno. [BABY CRYING] Then there was Angelica and Teresa. And I still haven't been born yet. [ROSA GRUNTING] They said the angels nearly took me when I was born. But in the end they decided to let me stay. [BABY CRYING] Dad said that's what made me so special. It's funny how you can't remember it, being born. It must be strange, sitting in the dark, nothing to do, then suddenly you can hear and see and feel things right. You'd think you'd never forget them, the first things you see. Monday's child. That's what Gran used to call Bruno. Bruno says that Dad never paid the bills, there was too many kids and Mum was always crying. But I don't remember any of that stuff. That Christmas Eve was when my dad had his vision, like the saints did. You! [EXCLAIMS] Oh, God, I can't believe it. Ah, here you are. Now my, good lady friend and I would like to offer you a five-pound note, this crisp five-pound note, if you would honor us with a smile. Sorry sir? A smile. Oh, Hugh! For us, since it's Christmas. WOMAN: I'm not part of this. Just an incy, winsy, winsy, little one. Itsy pinky little. It's not hard, come on EDDIE: The pig spoke to my father. It said... Money is like the sun. Only if you trust the coins will you become a man of property. Only then will you be happy. Trust the coins, but beware the King of Swords. EDDIE: That's what the pig said. ...see those pearly wirly little teeth. Just for us. Let's see them come out and play just for us, hmm? There we are! Sorry. [LAUGHS] That's right. Well done. You've earned your silver fiver. Danilo? Eh, Danilo. Trust the coins. I'll show you a game. Any game you want. EDDIE: My father trusted the pig's advice and did exactly as he was told. Swords and stakes, cups and coins, those were the pictures on the cards, and it was the cards with the coins that my dad played for, the ones that looked like suns just like the pig said. He was always on the lookout for the King of Swords, but luckily it never showed up. He worked really hard and saved all his money, and it paid off. Thanks to Dad's vision of the pig, he became a man of property and so did I. Ah, here we are. Huh? Look at this. EDDIE: At first, everyone thought Dad had made a big mistake. What you think, eh? Where is the tent going to go? EDDIE: But he had plans. MARIO: It's an original, Danny. It's beautiful, huh? Have it on credit. Come on, look. What's to be ashamed? Everyone does it. Yeah? Yeah, look. [CALCULATING] There. Nothing. [SCOFFING] Nothing. This takes a thousand years to pay off, eh? I'm in no hurry. Just make me an espresso now and again on the house. What if I dropped dead, huh? Then I'll make it myself. What do you think, Eddie? Mmm! EDDIE: So that's how we got La Bella Machina. And for the next five years, it brought us luck, just like Mario said. There's my mother, and there's Teresa and there's my older sister Angelica. And there's Pepe. He helps clear up yesterday's sandwiches and always wears the same cardigan. And there's my Nonna, who hasn't smiled since the day Queen Victoria died. Now we've got our own business. I'm 10 now and I'm a partner. Bruno says I live in a dream and some people think I'm stupid. But I know how things really are. I know the truth. My name is Eddie Lucca, and my dad says I'm special. PHOTOGRAPHER: Big smile! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Watch a birdie. EDDIE: A lot of things went wrong at Angelica's wedding, but we didn't realize then that real trouble was coming in the shape of a small brown envelope. Maurice, we're supposed to be having our picture taken. Ow! Sorry, darling. [GIRLS GIGGLING] [BOTH QUARRELING] [INAUDIBLE] Makes the perfect cappuccino. [ZAPS] [GIGGLING] Now there's Eddie. He's my youngest. Only 10 years old. Anybody seen my bag? It's a big bag. It's very important. The mass in the vulgar tongue.

[ALL EXCLAIMING] EDDIE: So that's the story of Angelica's wedding, but it wasn't till a few days later that we discovered what was in Mario's envelope. No, no. So, this landlord, eh? He pays you to get out? Well, yeah. How much? Enough. Hmm. You know what we got here?Hmm. One million pounds. Yeah? I'm going to be a big shot, I'm going back to the old country and I'm going to open a little business. That's what I'm going to do. Hey, Bruno! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Dad, I'm in my best clothes. What do you mean you're in your best clothes? Get Eddie to do it. I'll do it. Hey. Oh, whoa. What do you mean, get Eddie to do it? Did you pay the electric? Was it the red one? No. You know I only pay the red one. Don't work too hard, Papa. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Yeah. Morning, Mr. Giordo. [BUZZING] EDDIE: We called him Beetle, and he didn't have a mum, so he was allowed to do anything he wanted, anything. Yeah? Telly's working? Why you wearing that hat? It's a Zorro hat. But it's stupid. No, it's not. It's a Zorro hat. Well, what's for dinner, then? Chicken risotto. You coming? Yeah, all right. Be right down. EDDIE: Beetle didn't really have a family. So we lent him ours. You've got something for me, Eddie? Um... At 4:30, what do you think? Come on, come on, which dog? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What you reckon? Singalong? It's 10 to 1. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Singalong. Thanks, Eddie. Do me a five on Singalong to win. How do? Hey, Tarzan. Do me a favor. Use the stairs every now and again, eh? Yes, Dad. Come on, Ed. And don't fix the telly like you did the last time. Yes, Dad. "Yes, Dad. Okay, Dad." Are you eating over there? Yeah. How come you never eat with your father? [RACE ANNOUNCER CHATTERING ON RADIO] I did last week. Go on. Yes! Hey. Thanks. That kid's blessed. Yeah, yeah. EDDIE: Mario's shop without Mario was like an empty skull. It was really strange. Mario's getting a million pounds just for not paying the rent. A million quid? Don't be stupid. He showed me the check. He's going to back to Italy and buy a Fiat. Oh, yeah? Fiat cost about, at least about five million. No, it wouldn't. Yes, it would. What else is it going to cost? No, it wouldn't cost that... [STAIRS CREAKING] Oh, my God. [BOTH SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] You all right? Now maybe you'll believe me about Mario buying Fiat. Yeah, right. Come on. It's probably an artery. No. The blood'd shoot out at least 50 meters. I remember with my mum. God there was blood everywhere. It was horrible. I thought your mom got bit by a tsetse fly. Oh, she did. Don't you know how deep the tsetse fly bites? No. You're so stupid. Come on. No, I'm not. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Ciao,Bella Machina. Bella Machina? What about every month for a thousand years? Danny, just look after her okay? Ciao. Ciao. Ciao. EDDIE: Dad! Dad! Look what I've done to my hand! BEETLE: Oh, come on. It's not that bad. There was tons of blood! [BIRD CHIRPING ON TV] Hey, Kirk Douglas, where you going?

Mama! [ALL GROANING] [BIRD SCREECHING] MAN: Kill him! DOUGLAS: No! Don't kill him. [ALL EXCLAIMING] I'll fix it. No, you don't let him near it. Ha, what do you know? Careful, eh? You want to go in old people home like English granny? Go on, do it. BEETLE: All right. Going to need my pliers and my four-inch screwdriver. [CAR APPROACHING] Testarossa! No, it's a Porsche. Yes! ...if you really cared. Teresa? Bruno, go away! Listen up. Will you just leave us alone? Why are you crying? Look, just go away, Bruno. Come on get out. Leave the door alone! I just want to speak to you. Don't pull her about like that. [BOTH SHOUTING] Teresa! It's got nothing to do with you. Nothing to do with me, eh? Me and my girlfriend. So why she crying?I just had that bit re-sprayed! TERESA: Mum! Will someone please do something? What's happening? It's Bruno doing his big Italian brother act again. [BOTH SHOUTING] ...my sister again. Just go on! Bloody bastard! ROSA: Bruno! Hey, Bruno, go for it! ROSA: Bruno! Come here. Now! Just like Tony Curtis. Go inside. Where's Teresa gone? She's upstairs. Leave her alone. Will anyone speak to her? Not now, please! I just want a quiet family evening. Now everyone wants to be movie star all of a sudden. That's it, Dad. Don't worry about a thing. You just play cards and drink some wine. Whoa! Mr. Tough Guy. BEETLE: Telly's working. Paul, listen to me! He is your brother! Bruno, I think you need a wife. I don't need a wife, Mama. You need a husband. Listen. He's your father. You have to respect him. He's a good man. He's a weak man, Mama. He is strong enough for me. If I can't have you love, I'll take your hate. He die. Kirk Douglas, he die in the end. ALL: Nonna! Hmm? [SCREAMS] [SCREECHING] EDDIE: Bruno? Bruno, please don't. Please! Bruno, don't! [WOMAN SCREAMS] EDDIE: Dreams always mean the exact opposite of what they say. So if you dream you're going to be poor, it means you're going to be rich. And if you dream that someone's going to kill you, it means they really love you a lot. That's right, isn't it? [GROANS] [BOTH MOANING] Eddie! Can't find my sock. Which sock? The other one. Get another pair. Where from? Use a newspaper. I used to put the newspaper in my shoes when I was a kid. Did you? Was it comfortable? Go and get dressed. All right.

I am going to church to pray for your black souls. Especially yours. DANILO: Get ready. Dad, does he always wear that hat? Special occasion. He was with the alpini, your nonno.

I can't imagine you in a condom. SIBILLA: Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. How long since your last confession? Two days. And what sins have you committed in that time? Father, I come to confess for my daughter. She marry a terrible man. He is unnatural. He is using the family planning. My child, confession is for those who seek absolution for their own sins, not other people's. Yes, yes, I know, Father. I know, but listen to me. Now, this man, he invite his filthy father into my house. Oh, a man more horrible than him. Oh, he's an animal, a Casanova, a beatnik. [MAN SPEAKING ITALIAN] There he is. Is that him? He looks old.

No, it's you. You and Bruno makes me tired. Little boys like Nonno and Eddie are no problem. But you and Bruno... What? I think I'll get some air. Do. [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [BOYS CHATTERING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] And what's he saying? I don't know. Like family treasure I think. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Eddie. Eh? Hey, come on tell me. What's he saying? He says it's like magic. He says it makes things right. Yeah? Mmm. EDDIE: It was as though Dad had always known it. Ciao,Danilo. Mr. Barbariccia, the butcher's son had come back. Look. This machine cut to bits everything. Two second. Good, huh? This one, too. So dusty. I need someone for this place. Cigar? No. Thank you. So. It's long time no see. Eh, Danny boy? [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] How's business? Fine, fine. Everything fine, uh, Rosa... Mmm. I took a look the other day. Beautiful. It's a nice place. You are a lucky man. When he said about that magic box and making everything all right, I felt really dizzy in my head. It's really strange. It's not strange. It's weird. Just like you. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. What? God, what have they done to Mario's? And you... Oh, this place... Oh yeah. I got this place, club in Soho. A club in New York, too. Since I've been in America, I was lucky also. I tell you, Danny boy. There is nothing better than losing to make you sharp. Don't look so nervous. It was a long time ago. Another world. Now we are civilized men. [BOTH LAUGHING] Danny. I hear you like a little game of cards. Sometimes. Come down to my club. Play a hand or two. No, not me. I hung my guns up. I got everything I need. Yeah, yeah. You got everything. So, when you decide to put on your guns again... Guns! ...you know where I am. This place? Yeah. You know it? Hey, Pepe. What you wear? Ciao,Danilo. It's my suit. Do you like it? Pepe, inside. EDDIE: Looks like Mafia business. BEETLE: Nah. My dad says the Mafia's just fairy tales. Any game, Danny. Any game you want. So does mine. They all say that. [FORK CLINKING ON GLASS] We should have a toast. [ALL SPEAKING ITALIAN] ANGELICA: Hey, Bruno. Come on. I've got a toast, Papa. Angelica knows. Go on, Bruno. I got a job. I know. Over there, behind the bar, huh? It's a good thing, no? What kind of job? Now everyone getting a job, huh? It's in town. In the entertainment industry. You'd really think it was... Oh, the entertainment industry. Danilo. Scusa,Rosa, but the only time this boy smiles is when he's leaving his home, huh? [BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN] English. ROSA: Mama. You're not leaving home, Bruno. Yes, Mum. ROSA: But why? [ALL CHATTERING] BRUNO: I know what you mean, it's just that... Why can't you stay here? There's no room here anyway, Mama. Madonna. EDDIE: Where you going? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Just a phase she's going through, that's all. Yeah. Is Teresa expecting or something? Or am I being thick? Yes, darling, you are being thick. All right. Dad, are you just going to sit there? Why you worry, huh? Go. Go to your job. Right. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] You, home.It's all right, thanks, Mrs... ROSA: Do as I tell you. See you in a bit, Eddie. Sit down and stay here, all of you. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Excuse me. Only speak English. EDDIE: When Bruno left, Dad gave me his job. Bruno used to say that work in the caf wasn't all glamour. As the days turned into weeks, I discovered he was right. Really, there was hardly any glamour at all. [RACE ANNOUNCER CHATTERING] EDDIE: Dad said if I wanted to be a success like him, I had to learn the business. Most things carried on as normal. But sometimes quite ordinary people you thought you knew would start acting really strangely. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] EDDIE: Nonna. Can I come in? Nonna? Has Bruno returned home yet? No, Nonna. Is that old man still here? Yes, Nonna. Then go away. I am enjoying myself. [CRYING] [RACE ANNOUNCER CHATTERING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [BANGING] [YELLING] [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] He lost again. He always loses. [BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN] EDDIE: In the autumn, Nonno said he had to get back to his roots. He said he was missing the land. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] The bit of land Dad rented wasn't that big, but it seemed to make Nonno happy. Dad too. [BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN] As the weeks turned into months, Teresa got as fat as a pig. I think it was all the cake she was eating. Father, I come to tell you that that filthy old man is still there. I can't get rid of him. I say to my daughter, "Look, either he go or I go." And my son-in-law, he say I go. I cannot stand it. He mock me, he make a fool of me and I am too old for this. He has got to go. He's got to go! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SCREAMS] PRIEST: ...and all his words. And all his empty promises. Do you believe in God, the father almighty, creator of heaven and Earth? BOTH: I do. Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died and was buried, rose from the dead and is now seated at the right hand of the Father? BOTH: I do. Nonna. Why does it have to be baptized? So if it die, it don't go to limbo. PRIEST: ...forgiveness of sins... But I wasn't baptized. So you'll go to limbo. PRIEST: This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. Nonna, what is limbo? It is a place full of unbaptized babies, Greek philosophers, the Chinese and Japanese... But there's no fire or torture or anything like that? No, no, no. The fires of hell are for the others. More evil. [BABY CRYING]PRIEST: I baptize you in the name of the Father. [STATIC] [MUTTERING IN ITALIAN] [SINGING SOFTLY] Now. BEETLE: And it's a beautiful day here at the Sandown. The going is good to form. And they're on the start as always. And they're off. And it's Rebel Song... [SPEAKING ITALIAN] BEETLE ON RADIO: ...Rebel Song, it's Rebel Song... And he's going around the corner. And Zircon Sun is very slow... [SPEAKING ITALIAN] And it's Rebel Song, Midnight Madness, and Prairie Oyster! And going on to the finishing line in this very short race it's Rebel Song or Midnight Madness. Prairie Oyster's a close third. And, uh, Zircon Sun just doesn't stand a chance here. [LAUGHS] He looks to have lost. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] ...the end of a fascinating race here and, um, Zircon Sun's just collapsed. [BOTH LAUGHING] Shh. Get up, get up. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [BOTH GIGGLING] [COUGHING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I lost my horse. [COUGHING] I die. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [COUGHING] We've bloody killed him. You said he always loses. Yeah, but he doesn't usually take it that badly. Nonno? Nonno? Nonno. Nonno. Nonno! Nonno. We didn't place a bet on the horse. Nonno! Nonno. [SCREAMING] [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [COUGHING] [CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] He can do it, Danny. You fall behind with the payments, he can reclaim. What's this he?Barbariccia. It's not me, Danny. Who Barbariccia? Yeah, that's right. You just a boy, right? It's my job. I manage the shop. It's better than charity. It's ours! Mario gave it to us. Mario gave it to us. He had no memory for paperwork. Not like a man called Barbariccia. Now, he's got a perfect memory. [BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN] [COUGHING] Papa! [BOTH CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] [INAUDIBLE] What's up? I thought you were my friend, Eddie.I am. Yeah? So, why has your brother kicked us out then? What? He's kicked us out, hasn't he? Your brother is a bloody debt collector. What do you mean? [MIMICKING] "What do you mean? What do you mean?" You know what I mean. My dad owes money, right. And he hasn't got any. And when some rich git pays off what he owes, he comes and takes his shop away. Bruno couldn't do that. He hasn't got any money. That's it, stand up for him. Go on. Go on. Your brother is a scum. He's a slag! He's a maggot! He's a worm! Shut up! You shut... Just shut up! You're pathetic. You only see what you want, don't you? Just like the rest of your whole filthy, stinking family. Yeah, well at least I got a family. Not like you. Everyone knows about your mum. She didn't die. She ran away with a man. And you want to know why? Because she didn't love you, that's why. FATHER: Hey. Hey, boy. Come away, boy. Come away from that family. You'll never speak to them again. Eddie, what's happening, man? Come here. Jesus, man, you've changed. How are you doing? Come here, kiss kiss. You all right? Yeah? Hold on, hold on, I got something for you. Here you go, Eddie. It's a Ferrari Testarossa. BRUNO: Where's Dad, Mum? ROSA: He's upstairs with Nonno. Is he all right? Mmm, not so good. Think this place needs a coat of paint. [SIGHS] Always. Ah, Papa. These are for you, Dad. Real Havana, only the best. Great. Look at these beautiful flowers, Danilo. Oh, beautiful. So, uh, how the job, eh? How the entertainment industry? I know what his job is. He's a scummy debt collector. He goes around taking people's money off them. He just took Beetle's home away from them. Eddie. That was business between my boss and his father all right? Just stay out of it.Oh hey. Uh... What are you talking about? You kicked Gennaro out? Yeah, he did! We repossessed. It's what happens. You don't pay your debt, someone comes to collect. That's the law. That's business. You don't make repayments on the coffee machine, it gets taken back. How you knew about that? Well, Dad, it's my job. You work for Barbariccia. Yeah, that's right. He's been very good to me, as it happens, Dad. Gives me a lot of responsibility. He cares about me. He wants to see me do well. He wants me to be a success. You're right. Now you just listen to me, eh? You forget all about this and you come home now! No way, Dad. What you think, I'm going to work in a cafe all my life? This is your family! You are my son! Dad, this is your family, right? And that's your son! Bruno is killing me. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Nonno. Nonno, are you asleep? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [CHUCKLES] Well, you see, Beetle's my best friend, right? And we just had a fight. And I just said a thing that I promised I'd never say to him. Bruno's against Dad. He's against all of us. And Pepe's left and the coffee machine's been taken away. It's... It's just like I haven't got a family anymore. Eduardo. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Eduardo. Yes, Dad? Put on a suit. We strap our guns on. [HUMMING] Dad. The game is over. PLAYER: Ah the game is over, shut up. What am I thinking of? Danny. Sit, sit, sit. So glad you could make it. Now who's this? I'm Eddie. This is your partner? That's right. Ah. Good, good, good, good. I got a partner, too. [LAUGHS] Bruno. Come here. He's a good boy, your Bruno. But he got an eye for the ladies. Huh? Like his father. Okay, please get out. I got my partner. Bruno, behind me please. He's a little slow, your boy. Mr. Barbariccia. I can't do this. You do as you're told. Gennaro's place. We'll use new cards. Virgins. Remember what the pig said. Go for the coins. [SHUSHES] You don't even like Gennaro. What's that got to do with anything? Ah. It's a question of, uh... [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Right. Then we play the same game, Danny. You want to play me for that little betting shop? You need collateral. I got collateral. [CHUCKLES] Get some sleep. I stay here. Thank you. You sure about this, Danny? You sure your luck has not run out? The whole place. The cafe, the rooms above. Let's do it. The Ace. The Three. The King of Swords. [CHUCKLES] What are you thinking now, Danny? I want to know what you are thinking in this moment. You wont feel it right now. Danny, look, you just feel a kind of empty, like a dream. You can't understand it. But slowly, slowly it comes into your blood and then you realize that you lost everything. That you've got nothing. That you are nothing. And then you start to be angry. Okay, one more. A dog's chance. Double or quits. I got nothing left. Cleaned out? No, you're not cleaned out, Danny. You've still got a chance. You can still win. I got nothing. You've got Danny. You've got... You've got this. Put it on the line. Double or quits. Don't, Papa. You're not serious. Double or quits. Dad? Did we win? Does Barbariccia own our place now, Dad? Listen, not one word to your mother, okay? I need time to think. It's all right. Nothing strange. He's only dying. Does it hurt? Sometimes. Not this time. So, how much we lose? Everything? Danny, it's not the first time we have nothing. What's happening now? He can hear the angels' wings. [SOLDIERS SHOUTING] [BELL TOLLING] [SOBBING] Aren't you gonna open it? No. He says it makes everything all right. Come with me. We've got something to do. [OPERA PLAYING ON EARPHONE] PRIEST: Lord, hear us. CONGREGATION: Lord, hear us. PRIEST: We call upon you, who promise a paradise to the repentant Eve, to bring this brother of ours to heaven. Lord, hear us. CONGREGATION: Lord, hear us. PRIEST: Lead our brother, washed by the waters of baptism, and anointed in holy oil, into the company of your saints. Lord, hear us. CONGREGATION: Lord, hear us. PRIEST: Bring our brother, nourished by the sacred food of your own body and blood, to the banquet of your kingdom. Lord, hear us. CONGREGATION: Lord, hear us. PRIEST: Grant that we who mourn for our brother may be consoled by faith and strengthened... EDDIE: Sometimes I wonder what it's like in limbo. It must be like you're running and running, but you don't go anywhere, and you shout, but no sound comes out. It's like you're not there at all. It's like you're a ghost. Wait here. Dad? Mr. Danilo Lucca? Yes. I have been instructed by the courts to serve this order on you. Dad, this is a possession order! Does this mean the place isn't ours anymore? God, Dad, what have you done? He gambled. He gambled with all of us! That doesn't help, Nonna. Oh, that's right. You want to support a gambler? He supports you! I wish I were dead. No more worry for an old woman, then. I should be dead, like his father. Rosa? Mum? Ma, where you going? Mum. What's happening?I know where she go. She go where she should have go in the first place! Dad, what's she on about? Dad, do something! Too late. Dad! Eddie, for God's sake, come back! Mum! Mum! Rosa. Mr. Barbariccia. This gift, um... ...was offered for marriage a long time ago. It was wrongly accepted. It was wrong for my mother to accept and keep it. I wish to return it to you. This is nothing. When I gave it to you, I was just a peasant. [CHUCKLES] What I can give you now! Mr. Barbariccia. Can I ask you something? Yes. Do you care for me? [LAUGHS] Do I care for you? Yes. Rosa. For 21 years, I've thought of no one and nothing else but you. [STAMMERS] Every... Every day, I fight to keep you out of my head, hmm? Do I care for you? Hmm? Why are you smiling? Look at me. I'm not a schoolgirl. I'm 40 years old. I've got four children. I'm a grandmother. No, doesn't matter! You were promised to me! You belong to me! Mr. Barbariccia, I know you're not a bad man. I am a ridiculous man. I am a man who lost his honor! If you feel anything for me at all... My family's being destroyed. They're breaking each other in pieces! Right. All right. You want to humiliate us. Right? Look. We are humiliated! I am humiliated! Look at me. Okay. Is that what you want? Here. Look at me! But please, for God's sake, leave us alone! [BRUNO CRYING] Bruno. Yes, Mum? Don't stand there. Come here. Come and help me. Your mother has been making a fool of herself again. [GROANS] My knees hurt. Rosa? Mr. Barbariccia, I feel sorry for you. Don't feel sorry for me. Come on, Mum. Where are you going, boy? I'll take you home, all right? No, no. No, we go to Angelica's. I need to think. Rosa! Don't walk away from me. You can't walk away from me! [EDDIE SOBBING] [PIERCING RADIO SIGNAL] [DOOR SLAMS] [IMITATES GUN FIRING] Hey, bambino, che fai tu, hey, what do you want? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Be careful, eh? Be careful. Don't shoot. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What do you want? A game of cards? A little drink? [CHUCKLES] Women? Anything you want. Take the toy away from him, Falco. Here, boy, give me the gun. Give it to me. Go on. [GUN FIRES] [WOMAN SCREAMING] All right. Take it easy. Stop it now. [PANTING] What do you want, eh? No. BRUNO: Eddie, che fai.Eddie! [HEARTBEAT SOUNDING] [HEARTBEAT GROWS LOUDER] It's a crazy time to go swimming, Danny. The water's filthy! You could've got really sick. You're lucky it's low-tide. Here. Get this down you. It'll do you good. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Anyway, I got as far as Torino and the money ran out, so I came back. You know what? I was even dreaming in English. Honest. Crazy, innit? Sorry I didn't come and see you before. But you know what it is. Pride. That sort of thing. Hey! I can come and see you now. No, Mario. Not a good time now. You're kidding! I thought everything was fine. I thought you were learning to swim! Come on. Home. Bruno? Hmm? Are you dead? No. Thank God you're a lousy shot, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Nothing, I'll be eating there. With all of you. Yeah, everything's fine. He's all right. He's making coffee. All right. Eddie, be careful. Yeah. No, he's all right. Don't worry. Huh? He's here. Hold on a sec. One second. Dad, she wants to speak to you. No. I can't. Go on, Dad. Mum? I think he'd like to, but he can't. No, he can't. Yeah. I'll give you a ring. All right, ciao. Morning, everyone. So, what's for breakfast? I'm starving. Yeah, so am I. So where's the Zorro hat, then? Don't know. It's a nice hat, that. Yeah. Show us your ear thing a minute. It ought to do. Do for what? Nothing. Well, come on. Well, I think I know how to put things right again. Yeah? It's okay! Right! Oi! BEETLE: Now, the average timing for a dog race is 30 seconds, right? So we set the clock back, say, 45 seconds. The racing commentary is relayed downstairs through that cable over there. You with me so far? EDDIE: Yeah. BEETLE: We cut into the cable and run it into our tape recorder. Now the first recorder picks up the commentary and takes it 'round the loop, and the loop takes 45 seconds to go right 'round. Gently with that, all right? All right. So we know the winners ahead of time, and that gives us about 15 seconds to place a bet. Eddie. Put it on the inside and around the other thing. Then the second recorder picks up the commentary and relays it downstairs 45 seconds later. We can't lose. But if you're up here, how do we know who the winners are down there? A-ha! Testing, testing, one, two, three, four. RACE ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: There's a home-runner in the 4:15 at Campton... They've put down the card at Hackney. Four to one, track one. Seven to two, track two. One to two, track three. Five to one, track four. Eight to one, track five. And one-four, four takes one, track six. That's one to two favored track 3 at Hackney.

RACE ANNOUNCER: And at Hackney, there're all in. Cheers. Bruno, 1,000 pounds? Payroll, Dad. RACE ANNOUNCER: Players running at Hackney. Thank you. I feel sick in my stomach. At Hackney, they're off. MAN: They're off! And it's a level break at Hackney, as they go to the first bend, three, four, and six together, two is close up, racing onto the second bend, and it's four now going on just in front of three, then comes six, down the far side, four just in front of three and six, round the third bend... Going for the line, it's three now going on. Three, going on up from four and six together. At the line, three. Yes! RACE ANNOUNCER: Number three, Soda Fountain, is the winner. Fifteen hundred. We're ahead by five hundred. Yeah! Piano, piano, piano. Go for full cost next. [PEOPLE APPLAUDING] I didn't know you had legs. How's it feel, eh? Being on this side of the counter? Like a loser. Listen, I could only get a hold of 50 quid. Crayford, two and four. Two and four. Crayford. Tracks two and four! Excuse me, okay, dual forecast, two and four, the whole... Two and four. And me, dual forecast, two and four. Fifty pence. Yeah, they're putting on dual forecasts for quite a lot of money. RACE ANNOUNCER: Crayford. They're off. To a level break, and as they go to the first bend, five and one go 'round it together, just in front of three. Then comes two, four, and six, at the second bend. Five and three, nothing between them... Come on. Come on. And it's five still the leader, up comes two and four. And they're bunching up, and five's been knocked over! And three's been knocked over as well! And as they go to the line, two's now been left in the lead. Yes! [PEOPLE CHEERING] I just won 200,000 pounds! They should make him a saint! [CAR APPROACHING] Eddie. This is the last one. It has to be the last one! Bruno. The last one. Papa. This has to be the last one. Why, what's the problem? One more. Oh, my God. My lucky friend Danny. Such a lucky man. [SOUND OF TAPE REWINDING] [GROANS] Forget about it. We don't ask questions. How much Mr. Lucky got here? A total of 225,000 pounds, Mr. Barbariccia. RACE ANNOUNCER: Four to five, track three. Seven to four, track six. Your bet stands. Do you want that chance? I always give a dog a chance. Okay, let's go. No. Let's go, let's go, anything you want. No. No! What's the matter, Mr. Lucky? You lost your luck somewhere? Everyone is waiting, Mr. Lucky. All these good people are waiting. They're all in at Hackney. You scared? Look. I'll give you the money. And now, make your bet. [SHOUTS] Do it! [EDDIE SPEAKING ITALIAN] That was my Nonno! 225,000 dual forecast, six and three. My Nonno! [CROWD CHATTERING] RACE ANNOUNCER: And, at Hackney, they're off. Six and three were best away from two and four. 'Round the first bend, six and three, there's nothing to choose between them, then comes two and four at the second bend. Six and three, they're a couple of bends in front of two, then comes four...

Now I give you the dog's chance. All of this. One million for my ring. Just my ring. Just give me my ring. You... ...were promised to me. You were. I know. [SOBS] [BAWLING] EDDIE: Sometimes I wonder what it's like in heaven. It must be like the best time of your life. And it just goes on and on forever. It must be like coming home. [CROWD CHATTERING] [ALL APPLAUDING] PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, please. Ladies and gents, please, look this way. Everybody look this way, please. Now this one, scusi, please, thank you. Now this one indoors, so you have to keep very still, eh? Everybody ready? All very still, it's indoors, eh? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Watch the birdie, big smile! [CAMERA CLICKS] [ALL CHEERING] My name is Eddie Lucca, and that's my story. It's up to you if you want to believe it or not, but that the truth. Well, that's the way I remember it, anyway. Sometimes I turn a corner, and think I'm going to see another place again. OLDER EDDIE: The caf, the betting shop where Beetle lived, Mario's store. I can even smell the dark coffee, the warm bread rolls. But somehow, I can never seem to find the right street. Those familiar grey brick streets. But I know they're there, and I know that someday I'll find them again.
