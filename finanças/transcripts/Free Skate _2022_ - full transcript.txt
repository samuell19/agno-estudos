This season we have more ice slots too. FINNISH COACH: [in Finnish] Good, come here. Let's start. Today we'll focus on jump sequences and spins. We'll work on the step sequence once our choreographer comes. -[in English] Okay? -[in Finnish] Yes. [in Finnish] Let's go. [in English] The dressing rooms are this way. Everything must be smaller here but we would be very happy-- They have ballet later this week. So, that could be a good place to start.

CHOREOGRAPHER: [in Finnish] I must admit, you have a talent for finding these broads. [indistinct chatter] [in English] That works. Well done. CHOREOGRAPHER: [in Finnish] This looks pretty smooth already. More speed and with a little playfulness it's going to be great. [in Finnish] [in English] So, let's make it faster and more playful. Okay? [in English] Okay. [breathes heavily] [clock ticking] GRANDMA: [in Finnish] Bloody hell. [chuckles] [in Finnish] Goddamn this machine is a shitty clunker. [static over TV] [in Finnish] There we go. -[indistinct chatter over TV] -[grandma chuckles] REPORTER 1: [in Finnish] You announced recently the next season would be your last. How has the practice season started here in Russia? [in Finnish] Very well, thank you. We've taken the time to focus on our own doing and continue from where we left off last season. Expectations are naturally high. REPORTER 1: [in Finnish] You've spent several years here and gained international success. How do the practice and coaching methods differ in comparison to Finland? [in Finnish] The biggest differences probably are the precision in overall doing, and complete investment in figure skating. They focus a lot on the youths and you can see the results. [in Finnish] Beautiful. MOTHER: [in Finnish] Figure skating is a top sport here. They invest a lot on its success. REPORTER 1: [in Finnish] Any plans after competitive career? Rumour has it you've engaged. Can we expect baby news soon? MOTHER: [in Finnish] Well, I don't know. Let's get over this season first and maybe take it easy for a little while. Well, coaching might interest me. [snapping fingers] [hums] BALLET TEACHER: [in Finnish] Good. To the floor, please. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [in English] See ya. BALLET STUDENTS: [in Finnish] Bye-bye. -[in Finnish] Bye. -[in Finnish] Bye. [in English] You need a lift? [in English] Where are you going? [in English] Doesn't matter. [car whirring] [music playing over radio] [in English] It's rough. At least what I've heard about the ballet world. I mean, it gets crazy here, over there it's like another dimension. FIGURE SKATER: [in English] Yeah, I guess so. [in English] So, you're staying here? Permanently? [in English] I hope so. The paperwork is a complete nightmare. I just want to skate. [♪♪♪] REPORTER 1: [in Finnish] Any plans after competitive career? Rumour has it you've engaged. Can we expect baby news soon? MOTHER: [in Finnish] Well, I don't know. Let's get over this season first and maybe take it easy for a little while. Well, coaching might interest me. REPORTER 1: [in Finnish] Any plans to return to Finland someday? MOTHER: [in Finnish] At the moment home is here and I don't see a reason to return. I've been very satisfied with my life and opportunities here. REPORTER 1: [in Finnish] Thanks for the interview. [in Finnish] Thank you. Greetings to mum. [♪♪♪] CHOREOGRAPHER: [in English] The free skate is more about the theme. The feeling and expression. Hmm. [♪♪♪] [in English] Listen to the music. Be free. Free like a bird. And then. I already see it. The music, the costume, you. It's going to be beautiful. [wind blowing] [Finnish physiotherapist exhales] [indistinct chatter] [in English] You can take few centimetres off. [in English] Are you serious? [in Finnish] Sure, you can lose some weight. [in Finnish] Exactly. [in English] Oh, you poor children and your concentration camp. [both shuddering] [in Russian] Fuck, this is shit! [in Russian] I can't feel my feet. Fucking cow. [shudders] [animated voices over phone] [in Russian] Well, have you lost some weight? [in Russian] What a joke. [in Russian] Go inside or you'll catch the cold. [animated voices over phone] [in Russian] Stay if you like. I don't care. [exhales] [door opens, closes] [both shudders] [in Russian] Let's go. [utensils clanking] [in English] Thanks. [in English] I promised myself I wouldn't teach though. [in English] Does it pay well? [in English] The teaching actually pays better than the dancing. Which is cool because we want a bigger apartment. [in English] I'll take this one then. [chuckles] Okay. [in English] Why do you need a bigger apartment? BALLET TEACHER: [in English] We're planning to have a baby. [in English] Hmm. [in English] We've been talking about it for a while now. And it finally feels like it's the right time to give it a go. [in English] That's nice. [in English] Do you want any? [in English] Not sure if it works for me. I mean, you kind of need hormones for that. [in English] How long have you been missing them? [in English] I had them at 13 or something but then they disappeared. Sometimes I forget they exist. Or should exist. I guess that's the prize of trying to be good at this. [in English] You know there's treatments, right? CHOREOGRAPHER: [in Finnish] This needs more feeling, expression. Hmm. CHOREOGRAPHER: [in Finnish] The technique is there and I dig the movements. The short can be more technical-- [in Finnish] Yes, I know. [in Finnish] But this needs more. The final touch is still missing. Love. Soul. Something. I don't know. That girl is just stuck. [in Finnish] Stop the music. [music stops] [in English] What now? [pants] What do I need to fix? [pants] [in English] You know, it's not about that now. Are you tired? [pants] [in English] Yeah, my body is completely jammed. [gate rattling] [in Finnish] Come on, I need to clean the ice. [in Finnish] Yeah, yeah. [in Finnish] Fucking idiots for fuck's sake. God-fucking-dammit. [in English] You have to work with the expression, with the feeling. Like... how to enjoy it more. And the jam. -Do something nice for yourself. -[pants] [in English] Okay? [indistinct chatter] [in Finnish] Boys, come here. We have a tournament this weekend. Since we're bit short today, let's focus on rim rise drills. For warm-up, let's do two-on-ones in that end. Let's get going. -[♪♪♪] -[indistinct chatter] [door opens] [door closes] [speaks indistinctly] [in Russian] Mom, can you help me? [in Russian] Yes, of course. I'll show you a better way to tie them. [indistinct chatter in distance] [in Russian] First a knot... and then we do them from above. Like this. All the way up. -Not too tight? -YOUNG FIGURE SKATER: No. [in Russian] Good. Let's go. -[figure skater groans] -MASSEUR: [in English] Too hard? FIGURE SKATER: [in English] No, just a tight spot. MASSEUR: [in English] Yeah, I can feel the knot right there. Have you been in a fight? [chuckles] Jeez. [zamboni whirring] [scrunching] [♪♪♪] [thuds] [music stops] [in English] You don't correct the mistakes. It's pointless to continue if you don't focus. [in English] Sorry. [pants] [in English] It's your career. You can do it. Just do the jump. Remember where the weight is on the landing. FIGURE SKATER: [in English] Okay. [♪♪♪] -[thuds] -[figure skater groans] [in Finnish] Fuck. [music stops] [groans, pants] [in English] Fuck. FINNISH SKATER: [in English] Here. [in English] Thanks. [in English] Are you okay? [indistinct chatter in distance] [sighs] [in English] What do I do? The competition is next week and I don't have any money. I don't want my grandmother to [in English] We'll get you new skates, don't worry. I'll figure it out. You just take care of yourself. And smile for the camera with the sponsors. [both chuckles] [saw whirring] [music playing in background] [crowd applauding] [crowd continues applauding] [in Russian] Are you ready? [sighs] [breathes heavily] ANNOUNCER: [in Russian] Thank you, Ukraine! [in Russian] Do what you have to do. ANNOUNCER: [in Russian] [speaks indistinctly] Next skater represents Russia! [♪♪♪] [slurping] -[in English] Feels okay? -[in English] Yeah, it does. [in English] Let's try the another one out. [in English] I hope you have time to decorate it. FIGURE SKATER: [in English] Fuck. [in English] You'll manage it. [in Finnish] This is so unique. [in Finnish] These panels are from abroad. CHOREOGRAPHER: [in Finnish] I've never seen anything like this on ice. [in English] Perfect. I was worried I made it too tight from waist and down there but... you really have lost some weight. [in English] It's beautiful. [in English] It really, how do you say, compliments you. [in English] Yes it does. [♪♪♪] [wind blowing] [cellphone ringing] [dog barking in distance] RUSSIAN HEAD COACH: [in Russian] Dear friends. You're all very talented skaters... and I have happily watched you practice today. You all have a great future ahead. All but one. One who is such a fat cow... that she cannot fit the team.

ENGLISH ANNOUNCER: [in English] If the skater does not come to the ice within one minute, unfortunately, she will be considered withdrawn. [crowd applauds] RACIST FAN: [in Finnish] Hey, go home! [breathes heavily] [♪♪♪] [in English] I didn't have the time to soften the skates, I didn't have my medallion. I felt it, I was shit. [in English] Manners. Your team members and every other skater in the world would kill for the skills you have, or for the training you have had. I would've. Yes, it wasn't your best but you need to stop acting like a child. Stop blaming the skates or that superstitious bullshit. It was your first freaking competition in this country, and we build from here. You know you are good. So, start acting like it. FINNISH ANNOUNCER: [in Finnish] [speaks indistinctly] [crowd applauding, cheering] [in Finnish] Want a beer? [beer cans pop] [grunts] [in Finnish] Oh my. [water sizzles] [in Finnish] Why did mum leave? [in Finnish] Your mum was talented like you and... back then there... wasn't enough support or resources. She was given an opportunity... and she took it. Luckily. You wouldn't exist if she hadn't. [water tipping] [in English] I should've visited more often. [chuckles] [speaks Finnish] You've made something out of yourself... and gotten somewhere in life. You're here now... and I've gotten my family back. When your mother passed away... everything just fell apart. Your father couldn't take it.

Now it's not the time to make things okay, they need to be brilliant. Don't overthink it, just do it. [in Finnish] Hey, it's our turn already. [in English] Yeah, sorry. [sighs] Okay, that's it everybody. Good job. It's starting to look great. -[♪♪♪] -[birds squawking] [chuckles] GRANDMOTHER: Whoo-hoo. [in Finnish] Let's go eat.
