Dad isn't doing well. - Man, you say he isn't doing well every time you want me and Dad to make up. - [Jamal] Make up? There's nothing to make up from. This time Dad is in the hospital. It's not looking good. - I am close to a cure. I just need a little more time, and I'll come home. - [Jamal] Time? Dad is in the hospital. We don't know how much time we have. - Well if he would've invested in my dream like yours, maybe I would already be home. - [Jamal] Are you serious? I tell you that your dad is in the hospital, and this is what you have to say? Don't let Dad disappoint you. - But he believed in you. - [Jamal] That was football man. Dad loved football. You gotta let that go. - Goodbye. [Dramatic Music] - Hey! All right so chapter 13. Read it, learn it, study it, I cannot stress that enough and then we're gonna get into cancer clusters, pollution, environmental factors like mercury poisoning, Gen X, which is a big one in this town. Study up on those guys, it could be a pop quiz, you never know. Anybody got any questions, now's the time to ask. If not, I'll see you all tomorrow. [Soft Music] - Hey Mr. B. - Yes. - I'm gonna be leaving school early and I just thought it would be best if I told you face-to-face. - So my teaching is that bad that you're gonna be leaving school, huh? - No, you're a great teacher. My dream was always to become a photographer full-time and I finally had the money saved up and now I'm gonna take a leap of faith. - And how long have you had this dream? - Since I was a child. - And how old are you now? - 35. - So in 35 years you couldn't do, you're gonna do overnight all of sudden, great. [Upbeat Music] [Door opening] [Somber music] [Dramatic music] [Breathes heavily] - Hmm. Thank you for the roses. - You're welcome. - Thank you for the flowers yesterday and the day before that and the day before that. - Well, you're welcome for the flowers for yesterday and the day before that and the day before that. - You're so sweet. Mm, but honey you don't need to keep buying me flowers. - But I want to. You're worth it and much more. I can give you flowers from here to eternity and they wouldn't be a fraction of your worth. - [Karen] Come on, okay tell me about your day. - Typical. - Hmm. Your brother called today. Your dad wants to see you and I think you should see him. - He'll be okay. - Brandon, it's been five years. - I will. I will fix this. I can show my dad, my brother, all the people that had doubted us. Keep with it treat me like I'm a second-class citizen. Most of all, I need to do this for you. Karen I love you so much. I believe. I believe that it's in you to secure the whole world, but don't just do this for me. I don't wanna disappoint you. - Disappoint me? Karen you're not going anywhere, do you hear me? - God didn't give you this gift just for me. - No, no, no, you're not going anywhere. Karen, this dream and you are all I have left. - I do believe in you. I do, I have ever since I first met you but whatever happens, okay. - Nothing's going to happen, you're not going anywhere. - Listen to me. [Coughs] Listen to me, for whatever reason you stopped believing in yourself, don't you ever stop waving at the dream. You understand me. - I won't. That's my phone. Hey can I get a hot latte, do you have almond milk and vanilla flavor? - Sure. - Yeah. - Oh. - Please. - How are you doing? - Ah, tired but I'm doing great, thanks. - It's good. Wait, how is your cure for cancer project been going? - It's going rolling very well. It's promising, we're close. - It's great, there you go. You know I just really love to see people follow their dreams and do without selfish intentions. - Yeah, well thank you very much for the coffee. - You're welcome. Wait, you know what I've been thinking about it and I want you to have this. - No, I can't take this. - Please, take it. I see you come in here every day working on your dream and I just want you to know that we support you. - It's very kind of you. Thank you. - You're welcome. See you. - Bye bye. - I'll be back in one moment. - Yeah, great. - Hey. - Hi. - I'm Chad Spencer. - All right, what can I do for you? - I overheard you right over there are working on a cure for cancer. - Yeah, I'm an epidemiologist and that's my project, yeah. - Yeah, about how long you've been working on that? - Often all about 20 years. - It's awesome. I actually lost my grandmother a few years ago to cancer, so this really hits home for me. You said you felt like you're close. Yeah, I'm an epidemiologist and this has been a passion of mine, we are very close. - I'm an investor, so I was hoping we could have an opportunity to talk business. - Brandon Moore, nice to meet you. - Absolutely, when can we talk? - Come on now. - All right, well, I'm headed wherever you're headed then. - Let's go. - All right. - Hey Karen. Karen, you would not believe what happened. Oh baby I got some good news. Karen, whoo. Baby. ♪ Aa aa ♪ Karen. Baby I've got some great news. You won't believe me. [Somber music] I just need more time. I'm so sorry. Yes. - [Jamal] Brandon, Dad is gone. - I'm on my way. - Do you remember coach Miller, football coach. They named the weight room at Hanover after him. I used to get into it. You always into science and he was always trying to make you lift weights. The old two were funny to me. You want a smoke? You've been gone for five years and another five years before that. A lot can change the ten years. The Panthers play today, we should watch the game. Chill out, talk about old times. - Football, is that all you ever talk about is football? You realize we just buried our father and my wife before that. Last thing I want to talk about is football. - Sorry. I feel you though. - You feel me. You feel me? I'm sorry I missed the part where your wife died too. - Chill out. - 30 years. Now we've been together 30 years. And all I left her with is pain. - Karen forgave you. - I'm a failure. I am a failure just like dad thought I was. You hear that Dad, you were right. - No, no, no, no listen, dad did not think you were a failure, but time heals pain. - What if I don't have any time left. - You always love wearing this blue shirt. Kind of like you do now, you still wear the same shirt every day. And this haircut you were ahead of your time with this one, you are an original. You know dad kept the same picture on the refrigerator at the old ranch. My whole life was football. I had dreams of the Heisman Trophy but after the injury, I didn't know what to do with my life. Nobody wanted me on their team, my career was crushed. So not knowing what to do or where to go, I spent some time alone with the old ranch house. I cried my eyes off, but it helped. I think you should go there. You know a maid comes every Monday to clean the place so you don't have to worry about that, but it's better than being at home. It's still nothing out there so you gotta go old school. Take a jug of gas which you're in case you get lost. Don't forget to stop at the gas station. And take this with you, it might help. - What is this? - What is it, it's weed. You been gone longer than I thought. Just don't do anything crazy. [Slow music] - Man, this weed ain't nothing. - What are you doing? - Karen? Karen, what are you doing? Karen, I'm sorry. Karen I'm sorry. No, don't leave. Don't, don't, don't leave me. I'm sorry baby. [Crying] Karen, my God, I'm so sorry. [Dramatic music] [Groans] Did the cleaners come by this morning? - [Jamal] I told you Monday. - [Brandon] Somebody cleaned this house while I was asleep. - [Jamal] Did you smoke what I gave you? Exactly. - You know what, bye negro. [Slow music] You look just like me when I was a little boy. Are you kin to me? Are you? How are you related to me? So what, you're my kid? I think I would have known if I had any children. Who are you? - I'm you. - Boy, I've had a very bad week, do not play with me. Are you here to steal from my family? Who are you? - I'm Brandon Moore II, I was born on 110 off Kilani. I was born in 1970, I had a crush on my grade teacher, Mrs. Green. When I found out she had a husband, it broke my heart and I hid behind my desk, hid for hours and cried but I never told anyone. [Dramatic music] [Somber music] [Clock ticking] [slow music] - Hi. - Get out of this house before I call the cops. - You're gonna call the cops on yourself. - Who are you? - I'm you. - Look, I don't know what kind of game you're playing but get out. - This isn't a game. - Did you wash your hands? Trust me, I know how you are. - This must be some kind of new technology. - You haven't listened to a word I've said. [Slow music] Nothing's in there. Are you serious? - What? - My goodness man. - What is it? - I only grown inch taller and 35 years, what happened? - Breakdance accident. You are not tricking me you little turd. Who use up all the gas? - Oh, you know how we like s'mores. I used it to start a campfire. - Five gallons of gas. I'm not gonna get out of here. - The cleaners will be here Monday. - I'm not even supposed to be here. You're definitely not supposed to be here. Okay, yeah, Monday. That will give me time. - Why are you planning to do it? - Do what? - Kill yourself. - I'm not planning on killing myself. - Yes you are. - Okay, I guess this is one of those hallucinations that people have when they lose somebody they love. - Don't try to change the subject Brandon. Why are you planning to do it? - If you're me, you tell me. - You're scared Brandon. You're scared and it hurts. You're tired of being in pain and your pain comes from watching Karen die slowly. Something else is in there that you aren't telling me. - You don't know me. - Your pain comes are not feeling loved by dad. Life is frustrating because you know how talented you are but the world seems to not care and it hurts, plus the two biggest loves you ever had is gone and the dream is all you had left and that was for them. So the investor never called back, huh? It's a lot of pain. - Yeah, yeah that is a lot of pain. I'm tired of pain, okay. I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of teaching to students who don't care, I'm tired of losing, tired of being treated like a loser. - Wow, when did that happen? - Happens every day. - No, when did that happen? - When did what happen? - When did it become all about you? [Dramatic music] [Groans] - That is crazy. Marijuana's stronger than I thought. I thought yesterday was a dream. - Nope. - How did you do that thing? - What? - That disappearing thing if you do. - Oh, well it's not me it's you or us I think. - So you're saying that I have the power to make you real? - I am real, I'm you. It's way too much to explain. - I made you fade away. - No you didn't, that was me. That was me that time. It's way too much to explain. So what did you and Karen do for fun? - If you're me, why don't you already know? - Because I only know what you want me to. - I used to play old games you know, kind of ride it reminded us of our childhood. You play cards? We used to play catch. She had a pretty good arm even at our age. We used to take walks for fun. - Well, come on, let's go do that. - No that's just way too depressing. - It's releasing Brandon. - I've got nothing to release. - You came here to end it. Obviously you have a lot to release. Come on, let's go. How does your idea cure cancer? - Well, mainly it stops the growth of cancer cells. - But that's not a cure. - True but somethings better than nothing. - I won. Well, how will it cure it? - Well, that's what I need an investor for, so I can help prove it. Well. - I won. - Basically I would try to find the cure, not a remission. - Well, that sounds cool. Even though I have no idea what you're talking about. - I would advance immunotherapy, help the body's immune system fight cancer cells. - That's awesome too, I think. - You think. That could literally save somebody's life. - Well, I won. - You won. - Yep. - We aren't playing anything. - Yes we are, we're playing a walkie. [Relaxing music] What took you so long? - The ball. My phone's ringing. Hello. Hold on, it's Chad. No, no, no that is wonderful news. Thank you Chad. Thank You Chad, you don't realize it. Man you saved my life. Okay, thanks. - Who was that? - That was their investor. He's gonna talk to invest a group and I might have a deal. - So he might have a deal for you. - Don't even worry about it. - I don't want you to disappoint yourself Brandon. You came here for healing. - Healing? I'm the man, I'm the man. I did the work, I put it all in baby. The deal is from my work. - God gave you the opportunity. - God? God, where was God when Karen died? Answer that. Who's God when my father died? God. You know I can understand why you think that way 'cause I used to be just like you. I'm the man. I did this. Yes, whoo! I need to get my stuff from home. Hey Brandon. Little Brandon. [Dramatic music] Come on, come on. Come on! Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me? Come on. Oh, please, please, please. What is wrong. Ah, just. - The truck doesn't work. - Really, and how do you know? - You just told me. [Slow music] - Yo, you want some breakfast. You wanna talk about it man. - No. - Man it's hard for me to help you when you don't wanna talk about it. - Look, I don't wanna talk about it and didn't ask you for your help. - I got an idea. [Somber music] - Here. Sometimes looking at pictures help. - I don't wanna see that. - What's wrong with this one? You stuck it under the couch like you didn't wanna see it. - He reminds me that I'm a failure. - We're not failures Brandon. - What do you know, huh? What do you know. Just a stupid little boy from the country who thinks he's gonna be the next big thing. Well look at me, I'm you. Look. This is how you thought we were gonna turn out? There's only gonna be one person that's gonna care for us, that's Karen and she's gonna die on you. - Live for what's worth dying for. Leverage technology to create a world you wish to see, isn't that what dad used to say? - Yeah, he stole it from Gandhi. - Where are you going? - Home. I get up this place if I gotta walk home, I'm doing it. I can't believe it, this is ridiculous. God! Get out of here. I gotta do this. I can, yeah, yeah okay all right. That demon up there. My whole life is coming apart and I gotta deal with this. God. I can't be. ♪ Aaaa ♪ [Upbeat music] This is gotta be the way out. What is going on? Definitely missed the turn. Everything's the same. What? This is impossible. Stop copying me. - I'm not, it's you. - Just stop it. [Relaxing music] Cereal and orange juice, you eat that all the time. Hey look, I'm sorry I called you, called us all those names. - It's cool. - So you accept our apology. - I expect our apology. Hey, you want to play chess. - No, I gotta get this presentation together, so when they call I'll have some negotiation power. - Fresh, can I help? I don't know anything but... - Karen did say my god-given talent was to teach and I could teach you. - You think that's what Karen would have wanted you to do? - What, to help people, yeah yeah she would have. [Slow music] - What's wrong? - Nothing. - It is something you're fighting to avoid telling me. Remember one of the best ways to deal with the last one is to... - [All] Talk about it, cry about it just get out. - Yeah, yeah, yeah but I am me, you are you. I am not like you, you're like me. - Yes I am you. I'm you before you became a selfish... - Hey, hey, watch it. Watch who you are you talking to. You're just a stupid kid. There's a crazy world out there. They will take every nightmare that you could ever possibly have and eat it up like a grain of salt. - I don't care what it does. I can't stop me from giving up and giving up is a choice. The only thing guaranteed when you give up is that you're gonna lose. You have no idea we can happen. You just don't give. - Look, it will take everything you love and crush it. Everything you hate, it will spit out at you. Sorry man, I didn't say it was giving up. I'm waiting for this phone call. - Putting your dreams in the hands of another man is giving up. - It was all my fault. - What was? - Why Karen died. And talking about just not gonna bring her back. - You're right, but it could bring you back though. - I was given everything I had to find a cure. Karen supported me and my vision from day one. You know Karen supported me more than I supported myself. I needed a blood sample to test and she volunteered. I'm not even sure how it happened. I put those cancerous cells in her body then I ran out of time. - And I pray for you. - Hey, Jamal what are you doing here? - I was calling and didn't get an answer, got worried. What's wrong with your phone? - Man I just can't get a signal here, I don't know. - Let me see it. - It's on the table. - Somebody else came by? - You know what, I was bored. You know how I get when I get bored. - What's your password? - That, oh yeah that's uh 77777. - Are you Kanye. - Kanye, that's a good one, just easy to remember. - You do, yeah I was just checking to see if Brandon's phone is working. Okay, bye. It's working now. - What? You're good with those things, you fixed it. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm great. - Are you sure? - Bro I feel great, I've never been better. Perfectness, yeah. - I'm going to use the bathroom. - Okay, yeah. Knock yourself out. Don't actually knock yourself out. That's a bad joke. [Dramatic music] - Sorry to interrupt. I'll let you chill. - Hey, hey no problem, no problem. Brandon. Karen. Oh come on you two, come on, somebody please. Come on, please. Brandon, somebody please. I can't do this by myself, please, don't leave me alone. Karen! Karen! I don't know what to do. Karen please. Karen. Brandon, Karen, somebody please don't leave me like this, please. Oh, God. Jamal, Jamal. I need gas. Is that my phone? My phone is working. What do y'all want from me. Cowards. I can do this by myself. [Slow music] Hello, I'm Brandon Moore and I'm about to be the most famous man alive. I'm Brandon Moore and we're about to turn up. I'm Brandon Moore and we're about to turn up. I'm Brandon Moore and we're about to get it popping. I'm Brandon Moore and I have a cure for cancer. All my dues are about to pay off. My phone. Chad, Chad hey, yeah. Chad, yes sir. It's gonna be a good day tomorrow, right? What? No, no, no, no, I've got the proof, it can work. And I've got other ideas. But they aren't me. No, no, no, Chad, don't don't give up on me. I've given this my all. This is the last for me. There is nothing else to think about, my wife is dead. No, no don't leave Chad. No, don't hang up, please. Chad, hello. [Sad Music] - [Brandon] Today is January 16th 1985. Mrs. Brackett is making everyone in class write a letter to our old ourselves about our future. Just if you forget, I remind you what I want. I wanna grow up to be six six. I wanna be famous, rich and travel the world. But if that doesn't happen, it's okay. I'm satisfied with being married to Karen Rodriguez one day, don't tell her, I want kids and spend family time with my dad and brother every weekend. I would love fancy cars and things but without my family, what is it? And last I wanna help people with my gifts, whatever they are. Dad always said God caught our gifts gifts because he gave them to you to help people, not just yourself. I just hope you never forget this sign to younger me. [Dramatic music] [Car engine roaring] [Upbeat music] - Do you ever have a conversation with someone from an older generation and he'll say something like, "When I was a kid, I was really good at something." Whatever it is or, "When I was a kid, I really wanted to be "a doctor or a lawyer." Whatever happens to those dreams, I mean insecurities, just life. I had a dream that became a selfish desire. My dream was only good for me and I was so selfish. Whatever dream you have, when you leave this earth, the world should be a better place because you dreamed it. Even if it takes you 35 years to live it, live that dream. It's never too late. To fulfill your purpose in life, a dream plays a big part. Now that being said, let me teach you how to research on a cure for cancer. - Jamal. - [Jamal] Was good. It takes me to call you. - [Brandon] Hey man, you wanna go to a football game? - [Jamal] What kind of question is that, yes, what game? - [Brandon] Carolina Panthers. - [Jamal] What, for real? - [Brandon] Yes, I'm serious. Just let me know what game you wanna go to and I'll get the tickets. - [Jamal] Bro, don't play with me. - [Brandon] Not at all, I am not playing. - [Jamal] Thank you my brother. - You know, we got a lot of catching up to do. - [Jamal] I know. I wish that... - You don't even have to say it man. - [Jamal] I love you bro. - [Brandon] I love you oo man, I love you too. [Relaxing music]
