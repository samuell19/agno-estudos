So good. Life is funny. I made Captain Underpants and The Seriously Sick Steamerman. I made Captain Underpants and The Terrifying Trashtruckula. - Which one should we hand out first? - Uh, I don't know! They're both so great. - Well, Mr. Krupp won't like this one. - And he really won't like this one. - Which makes them both perfect! - And this, a very tough choice. Man, I love your drawings in this one. My drawings would be nothing without your awesome words, buddy. That's true. Captain Underpants and The Terrifying Trashtruckula! By George and Harold. So, there was this annoying man named Mr. Krump, and he always yelled at people about their garbage cans-- so bad. "Yours is dented! I don't like it upside down!" So crabby! Then this freak lightning storm hit a trash truck and created Trashtruckula-- Trashtruckula... defender of trash cans who chased after mean people. Mr. Krump got chased and fell into a dumpster-- klonk! And he ran and fell into another one-- klonk! And then he fell into six more. Klonk, klonk, klonk! Klonk! Klonk! And then one more! That was more than six! And then one more-- klonk! And the last time he fell on Captain Underpants, who was looking for his keys, again, and Captain Underpants said, "I'll help you." But Mr. Klump just yelled at him, too! So, Captain Underpants and the Trashtruckula went to go get coffee, and Mr. Klump fell in another dumpster-- klonk. Okay, the end! These comics are infuriating! But I know how to stop them. By getting rid of this! - The Tree House Comix logo? - That won't work. No, not the logo. - What's in the logo-- your tree house! - Our tree house? - That's where magic happens! - Our creative mother ship! And creativity is just a gateway to independent thinking and imaginative problem solving! No more! That's why I'm going to destroy it. No tree house, no comics! No! - Did someone say "What's Melvin up to"? - No! - Behold... - We said "no." - True. - ...the Rejuvigator 2000! Why is it part alligator? You work with what you have, and alligators are awesome. But-- But snappy. The point is I'll be showcasing it on my new show That's Melvincredible. The Rejuvigator 2000. Ah! N-No snapping! It takes things that are old and worthless and makes them new and useful, - like this 17th century Viking war horn. - Ooh! Totally impractical communication device. Now it's a smartphone! And that's Melvincredible! - How'd you make that TV show? - I used the audiovisual room. The AV room? That's been boarded up for centuries! Or six years, give or take some budget cuts. Now stop your yammering and let me finish telling these two how much I hate their tree house. Ah! Aw! Hey... you like to wreck fun. Help me get rid of that tree house. Destroy George and Harold's beloved tree house, their favorite place on Earth? They'll be devastated and they'll never recover. I've never been more in! Ha ha! Behold: the Graviseize 2000, a machine that allows me to manipulate gravity. I can use it to create a sinkhole under the tree house. Sinkhole goose bumps. Or I can pull a small meteor down from space to smash it. Oh! Meteor! Me likey! Or we can scour the local zoning laws for possible infractions. Boring and requires scouring. Yes, but it also has the lowest risk and greatest chance for success. Boring! Oh, it's not boring if you study the linguistics of the bylaws-- Boring. Hard pass. All right, meteor it is! I'll just use the Graviseize to project a concentrated beam of gravity at a meteor, pulling it toward the Earth until it makes impact, destroying the tree house and possibly the entire planet. Oh! Wait, what? And that would pretty much end Earth, the fragile planet. Well, nice demo there... anyway. - Yes, let's give it another try. - Okay. You know what they say: "When Grandma tells a lie, give another try, sailor boy." That makes no sense. Kids! What's next? - No, really, it makes no sense. - You make no sense! Ah, zoning laws, a panoply of bureaucratic minutia. As you can see on this map, delineating property boundaries, George and Harold's tree house is engaged in topiary infringement. Oh! I know those are words, I'm ju-- I'm just not sure what they mean. It means the tree house we want to eliminate hangs 13 inches over the neighbor's property. Ooh, so he has to move? It means he owns the tree house, too! - Which means he can sell it to us! - Aha! And then we'll turn it into a bagel shop! Uh... - We'll tear it down! - Oh! That's even better! So, what's this neighbor's name? - Mr. Cleveland. - Mr. Cleveland? You think our neighbor Mr. Cleveland is actually Viper Chai? That old guy? Viper Chai, the most awesome bathroom-themed kung fu action movie star ever. Viper Chai! Yeah. Look. The streak of white hair and the Viper Chai symbol on his door! Whoa! Mr. Cleveland is Viper Chai! Viper Chai! Star of Enter the Bathroom, the best kung fu movie set in a bathroom ever! Sure, if you haven't seen Crouching Fighter, Hidden Toilet Paper. Oh, yeah, that's my favorite... right after Enter the Bathroom, 'cause it's great. Not as great as Crouching Fighter, Hidden Toilet Paper. - Hmm, it's a deadlock. - Better than a headlock. Honestly, not a bad choice here. - I know, but... - I'd watch mine! What? Hmm. - Wah! - You crossed the line, man! Crossed the line. Aah! Yah! As Harold Hutchins would say, those Viper Chai movies are... So good. What in the Sinister Splotch is this? Yeah, what are Krupp and Melvin doing at Mr. Cleveland/Viper Chai's house? Look, Mr. Hammerface-- - Cleveland. - Same difference. We're here because that tree house is in your yard, - and we'd like to-- - We wanna tear it down! - So, what's it gonna take? - I don't wanna tear it down. I've lived here my whole life, and that tree and I-- Ah! Old-guy story. - Can you just skip to the end? - No. That tree and I go way back. I can't hear them. What are they saying? We need to know, and there are two, and only two, ways to make that happen. We could use a zip line over to his roof and listen down the chimney. - Where'd you learn how to do that? - Gibbinsky. - ♪ Gibbinsky! ♪ - ♪ Gibbinsky! ♪ Or we could use the LipRip app to learn lip reading fast. Wow, those are some creative ideas. Probably 'cause we're in the tree house, the source of our creativity. Yeah, a place of our own where we can think our thoughts in peace is a gift. I know. Let's sing the tree house song! Yeah! Three, four! - ♪ Mighty tree house, branches and stuff ♪ - ♪ Tree house, singing in the tree ♪ - ♪ Rising in the sky and stuff and... ♪ - ♪ Mighty tree house, home of creativity ♪ - ♪ Tree house, you're the one, um... ♪ - ♪ Home tree... ♪ - We don't really have a song, do we? - Nope. "LipRip: learn how to lip read in eight seconds with Hugo Mouthingwad." Sounds legit. Hello, I'm Hugo Mouthingwad. The many subtle articulations of the human mouth can be broken into 25 unique word shapes, as showcased in this sentence. "Hello, there is an ingenious method to the antelope's eating habits." And now you know how to lip read. - Uh, do you know how to lip read now? - Nope. Me neither. Zip line it is! So good. Ha ha! And this is the tire swing that hung from that tree. That swing meant everything to me. I played with it every day. It made me who I am. The end. Uh-huh, great story. But let's talk turkey. How much for your house, so I can tear down that tree house? - One million dollars. - What? You'd be lucky if you get half that in this market. - It's not on the market. - All right. Righ-Righ-Righ-Right. So, one mill... One millio... One mill... Uh-huh, okay. Hey, how about just that 13 inches that hangs over your yard? How much for that? - Million and one. - Okay, then, one mi... One mi... One mi... One mi... One mill... - Deal! Here's your money. - Very well. Once the check clears, the house is yours. Oh! It'll clear, all right, because I have that kind of money in the bank! I don't have that kind of money in the bank! So think of a way to make a million dollars, and fast! Got it! Autospoon 1000. It's a spoon that does all the work of a spoon! Also, I've got a line on some buried treasure, so... Absurd, you shaved buffalo! Keep thinking! - They're gonna tear down the tree house? - Not if we change Mr. Cleveland's mind. Mr. Cleveland! Mr. Clevela-- Summer Santa? No, we're George Beard and Harold Hutchins. - I'm the one on the left with the-- - Yes, I know you. We're neighbors. And you're Viper Chai, right? - Wrong. - Really? 'Cause you look exactly like him. And you've got his movie posters on your walls and his Thumbs-Uppie Awards in a trophy case, so... - Coincidence. - I'm satisfied. Anyway, we're here to save our tree house. What'll it take to stop you from selling your house to Mr. Krupp? Well, I suppose there are a couple of possibilities. You could make me laugh or you could help me find true love. I haven't laughed since Benjamin Franklin was president. He was never president. However, I did fly this kite, you see. Ah! Run, Samuel! See? It's been that long. Can you make me laugh again? - We make us laugh. - But we get ourselves. And why do you want to find true love? Because I'm an old man and I never found it. Also, carpool lane, right? Right? Am I right? Traffic, man! Traffic! Oh, we'll make you laugh. - All we have to do to make him laugh is... - Make a comic! Captain Underpants and the Kalamitous Kungstruction Fu Kolossas! By George and Harold. Once, there was this tree house where these two awesome kids made all kinds of cool stuff like pictures and cool stuff-- said that. And a battery-powered battery that zaps batteries so you can charge batteries. What? Yeah. It was basically the place where good things happened. But this mean guy didn't like fun and junk, so one night, during an electrical storm-- zap zap-- he created Kungstruction Fu Kolossas! He was, like, a huge robot made of construction junk and stuff. Kungstruction Fu Kolossas went right for the amazing Flying Tree House. Oh, yeah, it could fly, the tree house. It smashed everything and dug holes where you didn't want 'em. No, thank you! It dropped a big load of dirt on... Who? Captain Underpants! He was sleeping on a park bench 'cause he'd finished feeding the birds, including his favorite, Deidre. "Hey! What? Don't dirt pile me!" He yelled, then chased the massive klonky thing. Right when it got to the tree house, Captain Underpants said, "Tra-la-la!" And started to punch him, but he was solid metal all over the place. Captain Underpants was losing a bunch, so he pretended to be knocked out-- ha-ha, clever-- when Kungstruction Fu Kolossas came over to poke him and Captain Underpants pulled out the battery-powered battery that zaps batteries so you could charge batteries and drained all the power from the big old bot, and he fell into one of his own holes that he dug. Whoo! Then Deidre came by and pooped on him. Okay, the end. Oh, this is so good. - No? - No. Boys, if you wanna save that tree house, you're gonna need-- A million and one dollars. - Where are we gonna get money? - Don't worry. We'll think of something. We're in the tree house, the source of our creativity. Right! Thinking caps on! Got it! - We create a hit TV show! - We find buried treasure! - Wait, what's yours? - Find buried treasure. - What's yours? - Create a hit TV show. Wow, two can't-miss ideas. Yep, two's a charm. Yep, it's a real triple-threat, only double. It's a bunch of great ideas, you know, if you consider two ideas a bunch. It's like a gaggle of amazing geese, except that there are just two geese. Not sure about that one. Whoa! Melvin's Rejuvigator really upgraded the school's AV room. It's almost like we go to private school. - A school that serves bat wings for lunch. - Ew, what? The point is it's got everything we need to make a fortune and save our tree house. We got lights, cameras. All we need is the action. And you guys are the action. You get to make your very own show! And if people like it, Harold and I get a million dollars, thanks to Lookeeloo's Lookeeloot contest. Lookeeloo presents Lookeeloot! Make your own show, win a million bucks! And cut! Hello, I'm movie star Lee Dingman, but you know that. - Lee Dingman! - So you wanna win a million bucks? One, make a show, like my show Puncherado. - Lee Dingman! - Two, put it on Lookeeloo, world's 11th largest streaming service in the world, home of Puncherado. Lee Dingman! Three, if enough people like it, the Lookeelevel turns green. That means you've got yourself a hit, like Puncherado. - Lee Dingman! - And a million bucks. Lee Dingman! - And that's a wrap on me. - Lee Dingman! Lee Dingman! - Lee, we got three more scenes! - I don't. Lee Dingman! Lee! It's just that easy. Um, yeah, why don't we just use our phones to make shows, like, like people who are alive now do? That's the spirit! Now, let's fire up this dream factory. Fan out and find the power switch! Mm-hmm. Ah! Why does the Autospoon 1000 keep missing my mouth? - Because it's a dumb idea? - Wrong! It's gonna make millions to buy that tree house so we can tear it down. Now soup me, Autospoon. Ah. Mm... Found it! All right, here comes the juice! Let's make some magic! Yah! Yeah! Going again. This is it. Ooh, okay, it's headed for my mouth. Okay, here comes the soup, baby! No! It's a spoon-out! - Did you call me? - No! You fix that spoon while I fix the power. Okay, I can do this. I use electricity every day. What? Huh? No! Stuck! Okay, okay, Krupp, come on, keep it together. Someone will find... Help! - Three days later... - Stay back! I already gave you my wallet. What more do you want? We did it, guys! In three days, we wrote, shot, edited, mixed, rewrote, reshot, reedited, remixed four new TV shows! Give yourselves a hand. They're excited on the inside. This is it, the moment when complete strangers judge you and control your destiny. It's the perfect system. I'm betting on Independence Clay. Really? 'Cause Rock MD is the whole package-- doctors, music, and blood. On the other hand, Oh My Gar I Love Your Har could hit big. What about Gizmos, Gadgets &amp; Geegaws with Gooch in the Garage? It's a train wreck in the best way. - I like all of 'em. - Ditto. What show do you think people will actually like? - I don't know. Audiences can be fickle. - That's true. I mean, look what happened to Gorilla Lawyer. Yeah, that was my favorite show. I can't believe they cancelled that. Maybe we'll live long enough for a reboot. You mean, like, a year? Independence Clay. Oh, you picked the wrong country to mess with, King George III. We declare independence! Oh, really, General George Washington? Who, you and what army? Me and this army! Ben Franklin-orilla! Oh, not bad. But I've got Sir Lance-iraptor! Time to ring your Liberty Bell. Yah! I love it, but I don't think this is historically accurate. - Neither does the audience. - Hiya! LookeeLoser! Ouch! We should pull the plug and make our own show. Or leave the plug alone so the other shows can light it up! So, what you guys are saying is there's a choice between watching more shows or making a new one. - Why do you have those? - Why are you holding them up? Visual aids. Plus, they had to cut my show for length, so this is a way for me to get more screen time. Feel free to choose one of these before my arms get tired. Uh, Erica, you already put them down. Exactly. I'm one step ahead. Okay, our own show. So, what do we need? We need an idea, and a place, and a hero, and a villain. - Like Krupp! - Yep! It's as simple as that. I was stuck up there for three days, and I still don't know what's wrong with the school's power! It was a power spike in the AV room. What? Well, then take me to the AV room. - But you can walk now. - Take me! Maybe we're thinking too small. Maybe we need to break out of the confines of the old-school TV paradigms and explore new territory. - What's that mean? - No idea, but I'm thinking interactive TV, where you decide what happens in the story. - Yeah, it sounds fun! - Aha! So you drained the power and sabotaged the Autospoon 1000! - The what? - The electric spoon that's gonna make me rich and change everything, especially soup! - That's the worst idea ever. - You're not our target demographic. - Wait, that's our show! - The Autospoon show? Captain Underpants! We'll make a Captain Underpants TV show! Wait, what's-- ♪ Tra-la-- ♪ Uh, line? Hey, Captain Underpants, how would you like to have your own TV show? ♪ So click on the thing And give it a chance ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're goin' commando ♪ ♪ With Captain Underpants ♪ Whoa! Oh, no! My robot is out of batteries again. Mine, too, George, my best friend. These robots eat batteries like we eat cheese nachos, George. Ha ha ha ha ha.

Let's go get some batteries. It was a great idea to buy bargain batteries at Big Buck's Bulk Battery Bodega. Buck's Big Bulk Battery Bodega, the best battery bargain for the buck. We're, like, alive and stuff, and we want to, like, eat batteries. - And then take over the world. - Oh, no! The bargain batteries turned our toy robots into Battereaterbots! Hey, that would make a great comic. Captain Underpants and the Battereater-- No time, buddy. We're chasing daylight, and we need Captain Underpants! - Did somebody say "hero"? - No. Well, they should have, 'cause I am one. Psst, I rewrote the script. By that, I mean I spilled ketchup on it. What do you think? I think you better stop those Battereaterbots. Don't mind if I do. Yah! Oof! - I'm acting! - Yikes! Captain Underpants is overpowered 'cause batteries. He needs our help. Maybe we should time travel. Good idea, Harold. Or maybe we should build something awesome. - He really committed to that pratfall. - Yeah. Because... - I think this might be his tooth. - It's okay! I have more toothe-s-s-s. Uh, never mind. Now we have enough batteries to take over the world. I'm, like, over this helmet. Are we almost done? - You are done. - Nice ad-lib. Yeah, my Floorlings improv classes are paying off. Beware, Battereaterbots! We built Mecharoll to deliver a TP-TKO, ASAP! Yeah, and W-C-H-P-N-W-R-O-L-T-H-R-W-W-P. ♪ Tra-la-letters! ♪ Like, OMG!

Beep-boop. - Yeah, and wet 'cause it's melting. - Gooch, what happened to the ice? - It melted! It's really hot in here. Snow angel! Ugh! Why am I wet? Where are my pants? And why is my head throbbing? Snow angel! - This looks way better than it did live. - Yeah, slo-mo makes everything better. And people love it! The Lookeelevel is climbing like a possum escaping prison. Lookeeloo's gonna give us a million dollars! - And then we'll save our tree house! - Not on my watch! - Mr. Krupp, you're awake! - You were really out. And now you're out... of luck because I'm cancelling your show. No! We're almost there! - Now, what button does that? - Well, first you go to settings. And in the pull-down menu you click on "uploads." A pull-down? Is that like a pull-up? Never mind! I'm cancelling your show. No! Yes! And you can cry about it in detention. And you can put on some pants. Welcome to detention. - Why are we in your office? - Not the detention dungeon? Because the dungeon's being used to test the Autospoon 1000. What does this have to do with yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah spoons? - I don't know. - Yah! Oof! And as soon as the kinks are worked out, the Autospoon is gonna make me the million dollars I need before midnight to pay for Mr. Cleveland's house. You don't already have a million dollars? Did you not hear me? The Autospoon is money in the bank. As soon as people give me money to put it in the bank. And then Melvin will demolish your tree house. Melvin? He can't even lift a hammer. Yeah. He's weak as a baby. But he used his Rejuvigator to turn old construction vehicles into Kungstruction Fu Kolossas. From our comic? How did you get our comic? Because Mr. Cleveland threw it at me when I went back there to renegotiate for 45 cents and 11 buttons. And now Melvin's going to destroy your idea cave with your idea! Or he will as soon as he learns how to drive it. Ah, why are there so many buttons? Yes! Stupid piece of junk! Really? I feel like Melvin's made a ton of robots before, right? He knew how to drive those. The point is I win because you're stuck in here and there's no escape! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to eat my lunch. Oh, I left my lunch in there! Eh, don't eat my lunch! Peanut butter and spaghetti, or cereal and-- is this mustard? I'll try the cereal. It's actually not bad. So, now what? - We get out and save our tree house. - I've got it!

Uh, speaking of rolls, can we make a pit stop on the way? That pickles and eggshells sandwich is not agreeing with me. And back at the tree house... - Okay, ready for a rematch? - You're on! In about nine minutes after this punch finally lands. - Maybe grab a coffee. - Ooh, can I get hot chocolate instead? Get whatever you want. I'm not your mother. - Oh, wait, I'm supposed to distract you. - Distract me from what? - From this! - Aah! Oh, no. Guys, I really gotta go. It's an emergency. Do what you gotta do. We got this. Time to put the loss in Kungstruction Fu Kolossas. - A little clunky, but it works. - Wrong! Because I'm delaying the demolition of your tree house to say C-U-L-8-R to your TP 2.0. That means "see you later" in Internet slang. - We know. We're not our parents. - Fine! No more Mr. Nice Mech. And I've got at least three more quips where that came from. - Launch TP Tangle! - No problem. - We've got another arm. - And we have more TP! Who needs arms when you've got legs? Big deal! We'll just break free with a chin chop. - Harold, give him some chin music. - I can't. - We're TP MIA. - How? That was eight rolls. We should have one more left. Where did it go? We'll get through this together, rolly. ♪ Tra-la-squat-- uh, la! ♪ Captain Underpants! There's never a good time to run out of TP, but this time it's gonna cost you your tree house. Colossal Crush! No! This is the worst ending possible. Whew! I feel like a new man! Might want to give those woods a minute or two to breathe. - So, what did I miss? - Correction. This is the worst ending possible. If we could just go back and make a different choice earlier, I bet things would turn out better. - But life doesn't work like that. - True, but interactive episodes do. This is real downer, right? Doesn't have to be. Because now you can choose to start over and have a completely different adventure. And things will definitely go better... unless they go worse. If you liked that sad ending, you can watch the credits. Especially if you don't wanna be cheered up. Or you can choose to use the Time Toad and be dropped at a random point in the story. Yeah, if you hate maps, instructions, and knowing what's going on, that's the choice for you. It's all the fun of being lost... because you'll be lost. Just like I am all the time. Hey, you know what would make this even more fun? Lasers! Aah! The advancicrystal stimulates our minds, but it's the only way to save the president's dog. Why do you sound different? Didn't you used to hiss a lot? Yes, but this is a rebootimal, so no hissing. Also, I'm a woman now. Okay, great. That hissing was annoying. But if we sacrifice the advancicrystal, won't we turn back into mindless beasts? Yes. Sometimes sacrifices must be made. We have to make the tough choice. The First Dog must live. What's that, Thinkcoon? Yes. I will miss our telepathic chats, too. Wow, this rebootimal is even worse than the origimal. It's abyssimal. Here, boy. This will turn you from Rottweiler to... Thought Weiler! Captain Underpants and The Seriously Sick Steamerman! By George and Harold. So, there was a mean and angry guy, Mr. Frump, who used to yell so much that steam came out of his ears, steam, and fogged up the windows, like, everywhere. He yelled at the librarian. "Fog!" He yelled at the aquarium store. "Fog!" Then he yelled on the bus, and his driver couldn't see 'cause it was all steamy! And they drove into a giant toilet float in the Bathroom Day Parade. Bathroom Day! Everybody got out, but the huge toilet was clogged with the bus. So bad! It was gonna explode on the parade. So Captain Underpants flew in and grabbed mean Mr. Frump and used him as a plunger. Gonk, gonk, plunger! And, boosh, it got unclogged! Okay, the end! Sinkhole it is! I'll just use the Graviseize to realign Earth's gravity and focus it on a specific point, i.e., e.g., AKA, the tree house, and a sinkhole will open to consume all matter above it, including the tree house and possibly the entire planet. Wait, what? And that would be the end of all life as we know it. Hmm. Lucky it was just a hologram, then. Yes, so it's time for a new choice. Or an old choice. You know what they say: fool me once, fool me twice, roll the dice, paradise. - No one says that. - Not to you! And that's enough talking. You snooze, you choose. - And that's just gibberish. - You're just gibberish! - Wah! - You crossed the line, man! - Crossed the line. - Hiyah! Wah! Hmm. Hey! Wah! Ha! Okay, her interests include crochet, melba toast, wheat germ, and waiting rooms. - And just remember, be yourself! - Okay, I got it. Hello, I'm looking for true love. You've found it. ♪ Love, love ♪ ♪ They're so in love ♪ Aah! ♪ Love, love ♪ ♪ They're so in love ♪ You did it, boys! You helped me find true love. To repay you, I will protect your tree house with my life. - I'm tearing up this check! - Oh! - Love has saved the day-- Ow, my back! - Yeah! "The end"? Wait, what? - That's it? - So boring! Yuck! - Ugh, this isn't a love story! - Do-over! We want a do-over! Seriously, do-over! Anyway, we're here to save our tree house. What'll it take to stop you from selling your house to Mr. Krupp? Well, I suppose there are a couple of possibilities. You could make me laugh or you could help me find true love. I haven't laughed since Benjamin Franklin was president. He was never president. However, I did fly this kite, you see. Ah! Run, Samuel! See? It's been that long. Can you make me laugh again? - We make us laugh. - But we get ourselves. And why do you want to find true love? Because I'm an old man and I never found it. Also, carpool lane, right? Right? Am I right? Traffic, man! Traffic! Okay, her interests include crochet, melba toast, wheat germ, and waiting rooms. - And just remember, be yourself! - Okay, I got it. Hello, I'm looking for true love. You've found it. ♪ Love, love ♪ ♪ They're so in love ♪ Aah! ♪ Love, love ♪ ♪ They're so in love ♪ You did it, boys! You helped me find true love.

Because I'm an old man and I never found it. Also, carpool lane, right? Right? Am I right? Traffic, man! Traffic! Okay, buried treasure it is. - Let's see your treasure map. - What treasure map? You said, "Let's find buried treasure," right? Yeah, but I don't have a map. I said that 'cause we were watching Trash and Treasure. Why are we looking for treasure at the dump, Treasure? Because one man's trash is another man's treasure, Trash. Hey, it's the Mona Lisa! I guess we're going to the dump. Because one man's trash is another man's treasure. I was wrong. It's all trash. Not so fast. I just found a DVD of Scream for Justice. Sure, it was a complete bust, but it had its moments. This is a complete bust! Actually, a bust is just the head and shoulders. This is the whole enchilada, so, technically, it's a statue. That's not what I-- Never mind. Wait, if Horatio Dump invented dumps, he must've been rich, right? Oh, yeah. He was the very first dumplord, a real titan of trash. - So, where'd all that money go? - Oh! Now I remember. - He spent it on a statue. - This statue? It's pretty janky. The plaque's falling off. No, there's another Dump statue. It's solid gold. The Golden Dump. - How do you know all this? - Last year's Dump Day Pageant. I am the Golden Dump, and I'm worth more money than you people will see in a lifetime! Don't boo me! Boo your poor life choices! Aah! - So we gotta find that statue. - Nah, it's a myth. Harold, it's a secret message! "A statue below a statue. A dump made of gold. To find it you must choose between the two keys I hold." I don't see any keys. He's holding a fishbone and an apple core. It's hopeless! Not so fast, buddy. Anything can be a key, including a fishbone or an apple core. - Are you sure? - Sure enough. So, the question is which one is the right key? The fishbone or the apple core? - Well, it's gotta be one of them. - Yes. Yes, it does. But the question remains, is it the fishbone or the apple core? - Why do you keep saying that? - We have to choose between-- Oh, the fishbone and the apple core! I got it! Let's go with the fishbone. It's the universal symbol for garbage. Good point. Fishbone says garbage in any language. Les déchets. Kachara. Spazzatura. That was easy. Guess we picked the right one. Or it's a trap and we fell for it. Nothing we can do now, though. - Did the statue just fart? - Cheap laughs are still laughs, man. So, it's a butt door? After you. I'm gonna hold on to this. We might it need later. Nice. Very subtle, buddy. Pretty creepy tunnel, but it's also well made and well lit. How'd all these torches get here? And how long do they last? - Who changes them when they burn out? - There must be a torch guy. - No cobwebs either. - And a cobweb guy. So, since this is a nice tunnel as tunnels go, you think we'll get to skip the tunnel obstacle montage? No way, man. It's a tunnel. Is that everything? Okay, boulder, vine swing, mine cart, poison darts, rope bridge... Uh, yeah, we checked all the boxes. I feel like we're getting closer to something. - Why? - 'Cause we're standing on a trapdoor. Aw, trapdoor! Almost forgot that one. And... - There's gotta be a way out. - Or we're gonna die in a pit. That's the spirit, buddy. Wait, I feel something. It's kinda squishy but also kinda bony. - That's me. - Oh, sorry. Wait, I feel something else. - It looks like a fishbone! - Oh! Maybe it's one of those cave etchings from caveman times. - That can't be a coincidence. - Nope. Good thing I brought this fishbone, which I cleverly mentioned earlier. - Huh, another tunnel! - I was kinda hoping for an elevator. - But it's better than a pit. - And I bet it leads to the Golden Dump. We're gonna take that Golden Dump and then we're gonna be rich! We're so close, I can almost taste it. You can almost taste the Golden Dump? - Uh, yeah, that didn't come out right. - Harold, look! The Golden Dump! - It's-- - It's mine! Mr. Krupp? What are you doing? I'm taking that Golden Dump, and then I'm gonna sell it for a million dollars and put it in my bank account so my check to Mr. Cleveland doesn't bounce, and then his house will be mine, and your tree house will be history! That was more thorough than I would have been. Yep, checks all the boxes. Now, where's the elevator? No! Oh, now the Golden Dump is gone forever, and it's all your fault! Actually, it's your fault. Detention, now! Welcome to detention. - Why are we in your office? - Not the detention dungeon? Because the dungeon's being used to test the Autospoon 1000. What does this have to do with yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah spoons? - I don't know. - Yah! Oof! And as soon as the kinks are worked out, the Autospoon is gonna make me the million dollars I need before midnight to pay for Mr. Cleveland's house. You don't already have a million dollars? Did you not hear me? The Autospoon is money in the bank. As soon as people give me money to put it in the bank. And then Melvin will demolish your tree house. Melvin? He can't even lift a hammer. Yeah. He's weak as a baby. But he used his Rejuvigator to turn old construction vehicles into Kungstruction Fu Kolossas. From our comic? How did you get our comic? Because Mr. Cleveland threw it at me when I went back there to renegotiate for 45 cents and 11 buttons. And now Melvin's going to destroy your idea cave with your idea! Or he will as soon as he learns how to drive it. Ah, why are there so many buttons? Yes! Stupid piece of junk! Really? I feel like Melvin's made a ton of robots before, right? He knew how to drive those. The point is I win because you're stuck in here and there's no escape! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to eat my lunch. Oh, I left my lunch in there! Eh, don't eat my lunch! Peanut butter and spaghetti, or cereal and-- is this mustard? I'll try the cereal. It's actually not bad. So, now what? - We get out and save our tree house. - I've got it! Okay, now we just need liquid nitrogen to freeze the water and it'll crack the steel. We don't have liquid nitrogen. Aw, too bad. Worked on Gibbinsky. - ♪ Gibbinsky! ♪ - ♪ Gibbinsky! ♪ Yeah, but we're not gibbons with PhDs. Let's raid Krupp's desk. Maybe he's got a laser drill. What? He's got security cameras everywhere! - So that's where the book budget went. - Hold up. Krupp's in the A/V room and he's got a bunch of spoons. - We should watch this. - Or we can watch this. I just got an alert from Lookeeloo. They rebooted The Advancimals. ♪ Advancimals! ♪ ♪ Rebootimal! ♪ ♪ They're rebooting every show And now it's our turn ♪ ♪ This is why robots Will make us their slaves! ♪ - I love reboots. - Me, too.

LookeeLoser! That singing did not sing. We should make our own show. Or we see if the other shows can carry a tune. Making a hit TV show is a little harder than I thought. I know, right? I'm wondering if we should have gone for the buried treasure. We're in too deep now, brother. Besides, making a hit TV show seems to be a lot like trying to find buried treasure. - Deep. - In the ground. Now we're just rambling. I-I mean... Oh My Gar I Love Your Har! Hello and stuff! Yaa! I'm Jessica Gordon, and this is Oh My Gar I Love Your Har, the show where we invite guests on with amaaazing har, and then I tell them that I love their har! Okay, our first guest today is, like, Jennifer, who's, like, the checker at the market. And, Jennifer, oh, my gar, I love your har! Oh, my gaaar! The Lookeelevel is tanking. - Okay, next up, Lanie from the pep squad. - LookeeLoser! Whoa, that show crashed and burned. Might be time to cut our losses and make our own show. You've gotta have faith, baby. One of the other shows might be a home run. Was kind of hoping Jessica's show would be a catchphrase sensation. You mean, like, everybody saying, "Oh, my gar, I love your har"? Oh, my gar, I love your har! Yeah! Oh, my gar, I love your har! - Nope. - Eh, it's no "So good." Not even close. Gizmos, Gadgets &amp; Geegaws with Gooch in the Garage. Let go! Let go of my foot! - Gooch, we're rolling! - Oh, hello. I'm Steve Yamaguchi, or "Gooch." And today on the three Gs with G in the G, we're gonna fix my mom's dishwasher. I don't know anything about dishwashers. I've tried to read the manual, but I fell asleep. Let's do this. Oh, no, this is bad. What is that? Wait, what? I'm stuck in here! Help! Help! Help me-- Whoa! I'm okay! - This is amazing! - Uh, not according to the Lookeelevel. LookeeLoser! Well, that was a bust. Maybe we need to make our own show. I don't know. Those guys worked their butts off. Maybe we should give their shows a chance. What would we do for a new show anyway? We'll find out if somebody makes that choice. Isn't it weird that we're talking about somebody who's in another reality deciding what happens? - Ho-ho, maybe that's an idea for a show. - Ah, now my head hurts. I'm thinking apple core because fish smells. Solid logic. It's not my fault. Not my fault! That was way easier than it should have been. - Maybe all the pigeon poop loosened it up. - Or maybe we made the right pick. - Did the statue just fart? - Cheap laughs are still laughs, man. So, it's a butt door? After you. I'm gonna hold on to this. We might need it later. Nice. Very subtle, buddy. Pretty creepy tunnel, but it's also well made and well lit. How'd all these torches get here? And how long do they last? - Who changes them when they burn out? - There must be a torch guy. - No cobwebs either. - And a cobweb guy. So, since this is a nice tunnel as tunnels go, you think we'll get to skip the tunnel obstacle montage? No way, man. It's a tunnel. Is that everything? Okay, boulder, vine swing, mine cart, poison darts, rope bridge... Uh, yeah, we checked all the boxes. I feel like we're getting closer to something. - Why? - 'Cause we're standing on a trapdoor. Aw, trapdoor! Almost forgot that one. And... There's gotta be a way out. Or there isn't and we live in a pit from now on. That's the spirit, buddy. See? I told you! Light! And where there's light, there's hope. And flying bugs. The point is we're getting out of this pit. If only we had something to smash through, something made of metal, but small enough to hold in your hand. Like this apple core I said we might need later? Exactly! No one saw that coming, buddy. - You are not going to believe this. - Oh, yes, I am. What is this place? It's Teacherville, the futuristic city under the school where teachers live. - I've been saying it for years! - You have? Teachers live under the school... in a futuristic city... and it's called Teacherville. Oh, yeah, makes sense. I mean, where else would teachers live? And I'll bet the Golden Dump is here. Come on! Out of my yeah-yeah-yeah way! Oh! Whoa! Wow, this place is amazing! Mean Jeans' Beans, Turn and Coffee, and Guilt Drip. Huh, I guess teachers really do love coffee. And living underground would explain why teachers are so pale, and have beady little eyes, and long teeth to dig through dirt. You're thinking of mole rats. - Oh, yeah. - "Welcome to Teacherville. Teachers only. No kids allowed." That's just rude. "Teachers are totally doodie clowns." They really are. We better find Golden Dump and get out of here before-- Unauthorized children. Halt! Aah! Teachertrons, from a previous episode! Give us a sec, chief. What do we do now, fight or run away? Obviously we fight them, 'cause who doesn't wanna see that? Me, because robots are way stronger than humans, so we should run. You bring up some good points, but I think we should fight. We should run. If only an impartial third party would decide for us. Yeah, that would be really helpful. - Yeah, you think we could take 'em? - Uh, I'm suggesting we run, so, no. And now, The Incredibly Graphic Violence Chapter, presented in Rob-O-Rama. That's "rob" as in robot, not robe, because right now, robots, not robes, are the threat. Robo No Go! Oh, I knew this was going to happen. Sorry. Robots, not robes. Robo Where'd They Go? Look, I get it. Robe, robo. It's confusing. But it's robots, not robes. Got it? Robo Quid Pro Quo. Oh, for the love of-- You know what? Forget it. Everyone, in the pool! That was harder than I thought it would be. - Who knew? - Me. I said run. Teacherville must remain a secret. Prepare to R-I-P. Rest in peace? - You're gonna kill us? - Negative. R-I-P stands for "recollection immobilization protocol." You will be sent to detention and have no memory of being here. Sorry, that is confusing. But we won't tell anyone, just-- Aah! Which show do you think people will like? I don't know, but there's no way the next one they choose can fail as hard as that last one. - True, unless it does. - True. Maybe we should have made one called Fail Harder. Ugh, if that's even possible. Fail Harder! Starring, Captain Underpants and Lee Dingman! Lee Dingman, but this time, he's in a costume! - He's in a costume! - Trust us, that's Lee Dingman! He's in a costume! Why is there a clown? This summer, you're invited to the party, and Lee Dingman is serving up some punch! - Lee Dingman! Lee Dingman! - Yeah, cool, boy! - Wow. - Yeah, I guess it was possible. Which show do you think Lee would pick? Bo's, Dressy's, Jessica's, or Gooch's? I don't know, but did you ever notice that Lee Dingman sounds a lot like "Leading Man"? Whoa. George, you just blew my mind! Whoa! Ugh, these Teachertrons are fast. - Who knew? - Me! I said fight. Yeah! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-ha! - You thinking what I'm thinking? - Way ahead of you. Yes! Apple core for the score! - Aah! - That thing really came in handy. Aah! - Teacherville is kind of amazing. - Yeah, minus the teachers. "Teachers are totally doodie clowns"? Ugh, we can do better. "Teach art, not old lies." - Deep. - Yeah, it's a real thinker. You are surrounded. Surrender. Scrambling that sign probably slowed us down. - We are who we are. - Teacherville must remain a secret. Prepare to R-I-P. Rest in peace? You're gonna kill us? Negative. R-I-P stands for "recollection immobilization protocol." You will be sent to detention and have no memory of being here. Sorry, that is confusing. But we won't tell anyone, just-- Aah! - Lucky for us, Melvin was napping... - Ow! ...so we could borrow his Time Toad and time travel just before when our toys turned into Battereaterbots. - Hey, batteries! - Yes. And now to prevent our toy robots from getting those bargain batteries that turned them into Battereaterbots. I put bargain batteries in your toy robots! We're, like, alive and stuff. We want to, like, eat all the batteries. And then take over the world. We're back where we started. Okay, if they want batteries, let's give them batteries. - Captain Underpants! - Did somebody say "hero"? - We're past that line. - I'm not! Give these Battereaterbots all the batteries they can eat! Hey, those are real batteries! It's making me, like, overheat. Boop. This is real smoke from me and not from a smokes machine. ♪ Smoke and mirrors! ♪ We need to cool them off before they explode and destroy the world! I know just the place, 'cause that's my line. Told you this was a great idea. All I gotta do to win the jackpot is beat the wind monster. - It's a windmill, not a monster. - To you, not to me. Eat putt, you spinny beast. Aw! I hate this game and everyone who plays it, even mini golf legend Putter Mulligan! I'm Putter Mulligan. Great! So, now you'll help us? Or I could start over and try again. - Just like Putter Mulligan. - I'm Putter Mull-- Yeah, doing it again and expecting a different result makes sense. It'd be insane not to expect that. - We're running out of time. - Uh, we have more churros, right? Yep, a whole bunch. Mmm! All right, this one's for all the people who said I'd never make it, like Hank, and Keith, and the mailman, and Shaky Shirley, and Explodiguy, and my bathtub, and Tony, and Tickle Tony. Aw! Horace, and Antler Al, and the bus driver, and Tina, and Touchy Tina were right! I'm no good. - Time to help us? - Or time to try one more time. Hmm, I feel like there's lesson we should have learned by now. Yeah, we just have to figure out what it is. - I got it! Buy more churros. - Way ahead of you! Hey, let go of my churro! There are no construction vehicles here. Just this abandoned 1975 Deelia Beard. Robust. Orangish. Obnoxious. The Deelia Beard. The last van you'll ever climb into. That's not gonna stop Kungstruction Fu Kolossas. - No. We need something timeless. - Like the Deelia Mustache? - The Deelia-- - No. Something even more timeless. - Ooh, parachute pants? - No. Horatio Dump. Meanwhile, back at the tree house... Come on! And mean-meanwhile, back at the junkyard... Are you sure this is gonna work? Oh, yeah. This will give you a stronger mech than Melvin's. Probably. Captain Underpants? - Captain underpants, where are you? - I'm in here! It worked. I know that because I'm surrounded by glowy sciency stuff. Meanwhile, back at the tree house... I-I'd push another button, but what if that makes it start over? - Aah! - Wait. Say something cool before you attack. Hmm, something cool... Ooh, I know! You're about to get dumped, fellow. Eh... You're about to get taken out, trash. - Eh... - You're about to get dumped, chump. Close enough. You give up? Because this thing doesn't have a bathroom and I drank a lot of fruit punch. - You're gonna have to hold it because-- - Never mind. Because you're the crane attraction! Oh! - I guess that kind of works. - Yeah, 'cause magnet. That's right. And now I'm sending this Dump back to the dump. Y-Yeah, as-as soon as there's enough momentum. Why does everything take so long? What do we do? The magnet's too much. - Every move we make, Melvin counters it. - I'm okay. Maybe a little dizzy-y. Because we're doing what he expects us to do. Maybe we need to do the unexpected. Since I have no idea what that means, I say we go get help. It's a good thing that crane is rotating so slowly. So there's time to think about our choice. Yeah. Time is important when making important choices this important. Exactly. And choosing takes time. - Especially when it's important. - I'm okay. Okay, let's do the unexpected. How do we do that? I don't wanna throw up, b-but I probably wi... We need something that can't get grabbed by that magnet. Like... Like something made out of wood. - Like... the tree house. - Wait! You're gonna fire that at the tree house? You don't know what's gonna happen. But we're desperate, and it could be completely amazing. - Yeah! - You in? I'm in. - No! - No! Our tree house! We blew up the... tree house? George, look! - No! - Yes! - Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! Oh, yeah! I did not see that coming. That's right, 'cause we just blew your mind. And now we're gonna blow you away. And I'm gonna blow the buck I spent on that gas station hot dog. Oh, no! There it is again. A tree house mech? Magnet no good. The... science... doesn't... work. Oh, no. I'm okay, but my Dump suit is trashed, so I'll just squeeze out through the back door. - I guess we failed. - What are you talking about? - We saved Captain Underpants. - Yeah, we did save our friend. Almost there. Oof! Oh! Why am I wet? Where are my pants? And why do I feel so relaxed? And nothing is more important than friendship. What about family? And your health? And financial security? Well, those, too, but our original goal was to save the tree house. - And in that, we failed. - Yes. By turning our tree house into a tree house mech! It's way better! You're right again, George. Guess this is a happy ending after all. - Everybody wins. - Wrong! I win and you lose, because I'm gonna fire the gator thingy at your tree house thingy and then something bad thingy will happen. Probably. I hope. Hyah! Ha! You crossed the line, man. Crossed the line. What? You said you weren't Viper Chai. - I lied. - Ooh! Can we get your autograph? So, the tree house was upgraded to a tree house mech and life was swell. And that's the end of the show. Or is it? Because now you can choose to start over and have a completely different adventure. Because you lead a charmed life, just like Lee Dingman. Lee Dingman! Rawr! Or you could watch the credits. You don't want the show to be over, do you? Or you can choose to use the Time Toad and be dropped at a random point in the story. - And you'll be completely lost. - Like my keys. That's the fun part. - It's the journey, not the destination. - Unless the destination is Maui. - Hey, Erica, what are you doing here? - Justifying my paycheck. Wait, you're getting paid for this? It's show business, not show fun. Hey, you know what would make this even more fun? Balloons! Whoa! Was I wrong about that. I got a better idea-- Why don't we just use the Time Toad to go back in time and stop this from ever happening? Great idea! Hey, why don't we do that every time we have a problem? Because then you wouldn't need me, and I'm the star of the show. Okay, Captain Underpants. We need to move the tree 13 inches that way. Hey, mister, where are you taking my tire swing? Your tire swing? - Wait, is your last name Cleveland? - Yeah! I'm Bruce Cleveland, and this is my tire swing. It's my best friend and my sparring partner. My best friend is a bean bag. Watch this! Huyah! I'm gonna be a kung fu movie star! He is Viper Chai! Ooh, Viper Chai! Cool name. Can I use it when I'm a star? We can't take away his tire swing. Yeah, we have to find another way. Don't worry, Bruce. We're gonna put your tire swing back. Really? Ha, thanks. I owe you one. Okay, so... move the tree or no, 'cause this tree is kind of heavy. - No. - I'm Viper Chai! See you around! Well, say goodbye to your precious tree house, and your creativity, and your bean bag! No! Not Beany! That's my best friend! I can't believe it. This is the end of our tree house. We played there every afternoon. Nothing will ever be the same. Yeah. It made us who we are. Now it's over. Nothing's over, because... Why am I wet? Where are my pants? And why is that tree house still there, Melvin? Eh, never mind. I'll get rid of it myself. Ow! No! Lights going out. As long as I'm around, your tree house is safe. - But why? - Yeah, why did you do that? Because I owed you one. Really? Ha, thanks! I owe you one. Owed you one. Whoa! So, the tree house was saved and life was peachy. And that's the end of the show. Or is it? Because now you can choose to start over and have a completely different adventure. Because we all deserve a second chance. And a third chance. And a fourth chance, but don't push it. Or you could watch the credits. It's happened, like, two times. So road less traveled, I guess. Or you can choose to use the Time Toad and be dropped at a random point in the story. But you gotta be a daredevil for that choice. - Or nuts. - Or not paying attention. - Sign me up. - Here's a choice for you. How about less Viper Chai and more Erica Wang? - That's cold, Erica. - That's showbiz, boys. Hey, you know what would make this even more fun? Fireworks! Yay! It's like the sky is having a party and we get to watch from down here because we weren't invited. Huh, like my mom always said, perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did, so you just do more hard work and you just, you know... Bottom line, I'm gonna keep trying until I get this! Okay. I... hate mini golf! Ooh, a pretzel! Cap, you won! You won! - Who won? You who? - You! - You who, you. - You who, you who? Ooh, that reminds me, I never paid for yodeling class. Jackpot? I was right! We did it! I'm so proud of me. Ah, congratulations! You just won a million dollars! - Here's your million bucks, Mr. Cleveland. - The price is one million and one. Ooh! Hold on, hold on. I got it. Sorry, it's soggy with undie sweat. On second thought, you keep it. - And here is the deed to my house. - Yes! We saved the tree house, which was our original goal. - What an amazing journey. - Wait, why did you sign this "Viper Chai"? Because I'm Viper Chai. Hah! No way! Yes way. How'd you like to be in my new movie? - No way! - Yes way. We may be outnumbered, but we're gonna fight to the final flush. Hey, that's the name of the movie! The Last Flush 2, The Final Flush, starring Viper Chai. In theaters this January. So, the tree house was saved and life was grand. And that's the end of the show. Or is it? Because now you can choose to start over and have a completely different adventure. Or a slightly different adventure. Or you could watch the credits. I guess, if you're, like, the parent of someone who works on the show. Wouldn't that mean the show is over? Or you can choose to use the Time Toad and be dropped at a random point in the story. - But they won't know what's going on. - Yeah. That's the fun part. - Is it, though? - It is for me. I never know what's going on. Uh... how long do we have to stand here? Getting help was the right call, - but do you think he'll help us? - We're about to find out. Melvin used the Rejuvigator to make Kungstruction Fu Kolossas and the magnets got Captain Underpants! - Help! - Help? No one's asked me for help for 30 years. Wait, so, you are Viper Chai, author of our favorite catchphrase? You crossed the line, man! Crossed the line! Do you always wear your karate suit under your clothes? Yes to both. You crossed the line, man! Crossed the line! This is taking forever! Ha! Your tree house, I destroyed it! Yeah! And with it, your imagination. No! We'll never make comics again. Yeah. Our lives will be as dull as Miss Anthrope's. G'oh. We'll turn into robots and have to go to robot school... And there will only be one book called Robot, written by a robot. They'll have to read it over and over, forever! Until the insects conquer the robots and keep us as robot pets. Okay, the end. - Like this, right? - Exactly. And then... Wait. Harold, we just made a comic! Our creativity, it's... not the tree house. Hello? Are we still fighting? It's wet in here and it smells like hot cabbage. Huh, it's been inside us all along. We don't need the tree house to be creative. - And that's a... - ♪ Fact smack! ♪ Don't worry about your tree house. I'm a movie star, so people give me stuff for free. I'll make a few calls and get you a new one. Yes! Truth is I didn't know how we were gonna survive without a tree house. Me neither. I was bluffing. The boys learned they didn't need the tree house to be creative, but they got a new tree house that was free because it was also a billboard for Viper Chai's new movie, The Last Flush 2: The Final Flush, coming to theaters this summer. And life was dandy. And that's the end of the show. Or is it? Because now you can choose to start over and have a completely different adventure. It's like an adventure buffet with no sneeze guards. Or you could watch the credits. Right after you do everything else you could possibly do. Or you can choose to use the Time Toad and be dropped at a random point in the story. That sounds like a gimmick. Because it is! A cheap one. Hey, you know what would make this even more fun? Balloons! - Wow, those were heavy balloons. - What's in these balloons? Is it safe to stand here? You know, one time a sarcastic barista told me I should be more interactive with the tip jar. I told her, "Here's a tip. Your attitude stinks and so does your coffee!" Yeah, I don't go there anymore. Can someone get me a latte, though? Okay, don't miss out on the fun. - Wait, was I-- - Yeah, it's time to make a choice. If you want the left choice... Hit the left button, then hit "okay." And for the right? Same thing, just on the right side. Right! Got it, I think. Okay, comic book time! You know, one time a sarcastic barista told me I should be more interactive with the tip jar. I told her, "Here's a tip. Your attitude stinks and so does your coffee!" Yeah, I don't go there anymore. Can someone get me a latte, though? Okay, don't miss out on the fun. - Wait, was I-- - Yeah, it's time to make a choice. If I want the left choice... Hit the left button, then hit "select."

Same thing, just on the right side. Right! Got it, I think. Okay, comic book time! I made Captain Underpants and The Seriously Sick Steamerman. I made Captain Underpants and The Terrifying Trashtruckula. Okay, time to make your first bed. Wait, did I just say "bed"? I meant "choice." Let me do it again. - ...Trashtruckula. - And then I said, "This hamburger isn't even cooked! Who's the idiot now?" Wait, wait, we're rolling? Why didn't somebody cue me? And so, I'm walking along and I'm stepping on the cape. Every time, I go, "Oh, oh! My-- The cape is pulling me." "It's part of the character." "I can't use a cape if I can't walk." We're on the top of a mountain. Let me tell you, we're on the top of a mountain. And I'm like, "He'd take his cape off." What time you think we're going to be done? 'Cause I got tickets to see Punt Force Mama at the This-Isn't-A-Trap Dome. What? We're rolling again? Someone needs to wave at me or something.
