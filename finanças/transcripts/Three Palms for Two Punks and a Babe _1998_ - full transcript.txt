Fill it up! THREE PALMS FOR TWO PUNKS AND A BABE What? - Good morning. Morning... Look how little area you covered yesterday. We can't work like that! I paint, they steal my barrels... Then I have to steal too... I paint, you sell, that's it! And no skipping, like this here! Did we drink all this by ourselves last night? - Yes! You have to cover all this today, do you understand? And continue where you stopped yesterday, and don't skip anything! Look how many paintings is here, man! Dear God, why did you give me talent? Come on, breakfast, and get to work. Lane, breakfast! Well, this won't do! Let me hear you know. 'Knock, knock, good afternoon madam!' 'Good afternoon madam...' - Merry and with joy! 'Hello madam, make your family happy, make your home environment beautiful, family portraits! Chose whatever you like and we'll add faces of you or your loved ones! Just give us a photograph.' Which will give you back! - Yes, 50% on the delivery, 50% right now. Terzic, give me some money for yogurt. - Some money? Sell a painting and buy a yogurt. What is it, pussy, you show of in you car and you don't pay back your debts? Hey, Pendula. - Don't 'hey, Pendula' to me, where's the money? Give me the keys. - Pendula, don't, this is not my car, I swear. I don't give a fuck, give me the keys, you fool. Oh, boy, you are so fucked... Hey! Beautiful stranger, can you spare a yogurt? For all this money just a liter of oil, damn it... You can give me a phone number too, I pay all my debts on time! May God help you, young man! Hello. Make your family happy, make your home environment beautiful. It's so cool! Look, without faces! We're not interested, really. - You have some yogurt here. Maybe something like this, for you sir? Listen DaVinci... Go fuck yourself! I imagine the two of us just like that, like on that painting. And you? Me too. When we buy that apartment of ours... Have you been there? Did you arrange everything with those people? - Nada! Alright, I just don't want us to be in someone else's place all the time. We'll have our own bed, and we will have breakfast, and lie in... And to listen music. Hey, I found that stuff! You know the one I mentioned? What date is today? When did we put the money in the bank? We completely forgot. We were supposed to take the interest and all the money yesterday. Nadica, honey, don't you worry about anything. Today is Saturday. Yes, but... - You don't take money on weekends! Weekends doesn't count. We're taking the money on Monday. Look. If we put it on 27th, so three months later, that is... Don't you think about that! It's cold, you'll get sick. Go get dressed. I'll give you these two paintings in exchange for a visa, it doesn't matter where to. But I'd like Mauritius. - We don't have it for Mauritius. We have for Cuba, China, Korea, Libya, Chad, Somalia, for exotics. And classic, Germany or Australia if you want. Day after tomorrow, when we get the money, the guy is waiting for us, we give him the money, he gives us apartment and the keys, everything's fine. And aunt's furniture that I sold. We'll buy completely new one. And? And... we get marry and everything's fine. And? - And, and... My friend is coming in 15 minutes, I have to give him the keys. It would be stupid if he finds you here. Come on, cheers! Roman, it's me. I forgot my keys. I know exactly what you're thinking. But you're wrong! I swear! Let my mother die if I'm lying! You... don't trust me! Hey there! Hello, it's me again. Do you want me to give you my phone number so you can call... Actually, I don't... Grab the rookie! Which one of these are you? Canak? Zanetic? Markovic? Which one? - Men, don't I don't even live in this street. Really? So we have to catch you in your area? You're under arrest, pal! Dismiss! Attention! - What is it? What is it, you ask? Where's the war call? Where is the war call? Get the war call! Scram! Lane? - Moma? Are you working, lazies? Hello, neighbour! When are you going to take me out for a beer? Great necklace, neighbour. I love you, neighbour! How can you remember our hymn from elementary school? Like a crazy person! - And you're so normal, slapping military police around! They sent me home from the front. So now I'm scaring these bastards from military police. I'm saving kids around the hood. Besides, if it weren't for me, you'd be in uniform now! That's true. Thank you, mate. You remember that I've always liked army and weapons. You like the music too. I remember us going to the concerts. You even tried to play the bass, despite your extreme lack of music talent! That was for the chicks. I liked weapons more. I was on the front too. - No shit? I told you. - And what happened? They sent me back. - Why did they do that? So you're allergic to gunpowder smoke? - Tough luck. Now I cultivate my mother's flowers. My folks aren't coming here from the lot. They cultivate cabbage, making a business. You know what I figured? Plants love when I play some music for them. But not Vivaldi or stuff like that. But this. They get more strong! I tried that on my father's lot, I played it to the cabbage! But those peasants didn't have the understanding. They cut his electricity. My dad was pissed! So I'm not going there anymore! How can Kosara burn donuts? My grandma Dara, survived two Kraut occupations, she was always saying: 'It's important that you always have gas and brandy in the house.' Come on, have some. Plum brandy cleans the blood, clears the mind, and... - Strengthens character, like people from Valjevo say! Why didn't I beat him to death? Forget about men, when you bury them, they're all the same. You know what? Strength comes trough the mouth, come on, eat. I won't eat! I won't eat anything ever again! Now I have to get ready! I have to get ready for work! - If only can my late brother and sister-in-law see me for what kind of job you're getting ready. Kosara, how else are we going to survive? With your invalidity pension? Hey girls, is there anything ot eat? Where have you been? - And where have you been? 100 grams of raw one. Enough with these grissini already! Don't give everything away, you eat some too. And cheer up, that Roman doesn't have a star on his forehead, scumbag! Don't give up! It's better that it happened now then in marriage, am I right? 'Weekends doesn't count'. How can they arrange that power comes back just before the news? What do you think? Bro, these paintings aren't bad. They're just disgusting. What can I do? That's how I pay rent. And for food you're carrying monuments around? Listen pal, I had a job but I quit. Military police is after me, and they didn't pay me at all. I was guarding some warehouse. - Colleague! I'm a guard too. No shit! - I swear! You know these private banks, 'interest every month'. You didn't give them money, did you? - Are you crazy? I don't have any money. Great, that's some major scam. How can you sit at home and earning 30% of interest per month? But I couldn't find a better job. And the pay isn't bad. - Who cares, mate? Cheers! Can that pal of your paint a big painting, like this wall for example? Sure, but we don't have that much paint. - Not for me, for the bank! They need a big billboard. You could earn some cash. Come on, that would be great! I wouldn't have to carry this shit around! Hold on. You're gonna give me this so I can take it to the director. I hope it'll be alright. It will be, for sure. She thinks I'm hot. - No way! - Really. - Did you bang her? No. - You're lying! - I didn't, I swear! Come on Monday, at noon at this address. Are you guarding or robbing the bank? Are you screwing something? Are you screwing something? - No, but I have one chick on mind. I never saw her, but we talk on the phone! You know what's her name? - No! - Modesty! It's horrible! Hello! I'm sorry I'm late. Some serious shit again, huh? What is it? Money? Roman? Money and Roman, huh? I told you. Sister, I'm sorry for meddling, but it's best to forget him. I'm trying. - That is typical example of wrong partner choice. What is that? - My life, smuggling! Hello? Agency '1001 sigh' here No, it's not Samantha, it's Modesty. Damn fucking leaky shit! Fuck you! Go to the Black Sea, fuck! Where have you been? - I'm here. You know, I figured why this officer across are stealing these barrels. They're getting ready for another heating season under sanctions so they're making those furnaces out of barrels. That's officer's settlement there. Red gang! Gang! - Did you sell anything? You did? Lane, my love, let's drink to that! Let's drink to that, honey! Where's the food? - There's no food. How come? Where's my painting? - Screw the painting. I've arranged a mean business for you! - What business, where's my painting? Can you hear me? You have a job! A private bank, a billboard 40m2. 40... A billboard that's 40m2? - More or less. Don't fuck with me, do you know how much paint would I need? - You won't buy it, idiot! Laki, will there be something in advance? - Yes... I don't know, don't fuck with me! Anyway, we have a meeting with the director tomorrow, so you'll know everything. Futura? Laki, what should I do, I mean what should I paint? Let me sleep, please. Go look for the barrels. What is this?! You sleep and not paying money back! Hey, Pendula! - What 'hey', what 'Pandula'? You think Pendula is a fool? You're running away from Pendula? You think Pendula can't find you? No, let me explain? - What will you explain? Quiet! Be quiet! You talk to much! You're annoying me on purpose! Where's the money? Where's the money? Give me the dough! Give me the dough! Give me the car keys! - Don't take my car, I'm the business I swear! I don't give a fuck about your business or your swearing! I want the dough! Let me explain! Look at these paintings. This will sell like crazy, I just have to take the money. Look. And you're some kind of artist? Pay attention now. This one! You'll take this one to one chick on Senjak, and you'll say 'Mister Pendula sent this!' Mister Pendula! You understand? - I understand, bro. I'm not your bro! Mister Pendula. Be good. Pendula loves you! Go on! Say it! Make your home environment happy, is that it? Then I say 'I'd love to, but it's too expensive.' Then you say 'we give our stuff on credit.' And then I say 'come back when the sanctions are over'. Is this 20? Mihajlo Avramovic street? You're Nadica? Are you stalking me? - No, no, no. Your boyfriend Pendula sent me to give you this painting. Here, if you don't believe me. You're very popular chick. First that mannequin, then Pendula... Since you're very curious I'll explain, I don't know any mannequin anymore, and you can tell your pal Pendula to stop stalking me! What is it now? - I was just kidding. I actually came to give you back that yogurt, but I was attacked by small group of pensioners and they robbed me. Great! - Given these new circumstances, I would like to invite you to the local store, so we can with yogurt or two, patch up all of our misunderstandings. - I'm sorry. Maybe some other day? And your phone number? God, help me! What are you doing here? - Can you give me a push? - Half a mark. I just have 10, can you do it for free? - I'll exchange it for you. You little shit... I can't believe this. I can't believe this! Is that him? - No. Why the fuck are we saying hello then? Hello, Lane. - Hello, Moma. An artist? - Zoran Terzic. - Come on. What did I say for civilians in official premises? - We're meeting the director. These are our artists who will do a billboard for us. What did I say for your white socks? Sit down. Do you want a drink? If it's not to early for you. I usually don't drink, but I could have a glass... Man, there's so much money here! - And on fridays when there's money from all branches. We have several millions. - Marks? Marks, dollars, franks, it depends. Say pal, could I come on friday and take one stack? No one will notice. Are you crazy? What about security? What's here? - Safe. And here? - Director's office! Where are lasers, alarms, sensors, cameras, electrified fences? What's wrong with you? This is Serbia. Listen, money is being transported in boxes for the detergent and coffee bags. It's just being counted here and passed on to the boss. He's investing somewhere supposedly. - Smart man. He's smart alright. What a man! He has a hotline agency in this building. Down in the basement. What's that? - That's phone sex and gasping, but that's a major scam because you pay the price of international call and they play you tapes with whores. No, it's live, I swear! - I told you about Modesty. Now you'll hear. I don't care, pal, I don't even have a phone. There's no way they can screw me for international calls, or domestic either! Is it ringing? Hello? Hello? Our bank is the main bank in bank chains Futura. Competition on the market is, as you know, extremely strong and me and my boss would like that on the top of this building is something that will inform the whole city 'we work, we build, we are successfull'. You understand? Like a slogan. With Futura... I'm on the meeting. What did you say? - I said, with Futura to Paradise. For example. That's it! That's exactly it! I'm glad we understand each other. And that should be something like 2x5? That's tiny, madam. To be well seen it has to be at least 6x10. - Minimum. Boys, should we meet at 6x4? - 24! It's a deal! Miss, step aside, what's wrong with you? Mister Roman Peric had legal authorization. This is your signature. Miss, please... - Don't touch me! - Neighbour? Yes? - You're a bit nervous. Listen, if I have to I'll personally rip his heart out! Go and take care of a customer. Excuse me, a saver. Come back later to arrange something. Well, boys, let us close our financial construction? Sound good? - It's closed. For the job! - For the job! For the money! - Sure! You don't even have to drink here, it's rocking all the same! This is nothing. You should see when they steal a barrel! What do you do then? - We steal from them. They steal from us, we from them, all good. It's fair! - And God's commandment? Thou shalt not steal? Tell me is theft a mortal sin, or is it from the commandments? 'Thou shalt not steal!' That's commandment! Come on theologians, enough of that! I should think of something for billboard. - Come on man, that's very simple. We only have to give people an impression of better future. You'll pain a nice sunny day, beach, sea, you put one palm, a chick under it and that's it. You do that all the time, just make it decent, because it's for the bank. Laki, well done! That's it! A palm, man! Put me under a palm too! - I will, taking a shit! Put me under one, please. - You too? - A palm for everyone! So three palms? - Three. - Three palms! Three palms on the island of happiness where clouds are circling all night... Everything's fine. He's contemplating. Listen, Moma. That thing with palms and chicks, we can do that, we just need the money. Really? I know, but we don't have any money. No problem! We'll rob your bank! Ladies and gentlemen! This is the most interesting moment of your lives! It would be a shame that it's also your last one. Hello, Pendula! Lane the Wild. A bandit and a playboy. What do you think? I think you're out of your mind. Give me that brandy! Give me the brandy so I can destroy myself! Give me the 10. It's so nice when no one calls. Hey bro, today you'll have to walk the monkey by yourself. Insane! ... 6400 seconds per day... You two will get fired! I'm telling you, we should rob that bank. You're so boring! - Listen to Laki, bro. I told you, forget it! I don't have the money, I don't have the car. I mean I do, but like I don't. I don't have much of a body. - True. If I'd go outside now I wouldn't have the money for yogurt to sober up. You know what kind of chick I've met? I've gone mad, mad! I brought her flowers and ran away. You're such a civilian! Flowers? Is she a graveyard to bring her flowers? You don't need the money, you need balls. No philosophy. Straight to the door, 'Is that the boobies? It is?' Thank you! You bang her, goodbye! Yeah, right! I can see your hands are full of boobs! It will be. You just have to have a plan how to attack the chick. I told you about the one in hotline agency, Modesty. I organized, I'm ready to find out who she is, without philosophy. I'm getting what I want. You understand? You're right. Why shouldn't I... - Why shouldn't you cut the crap and come with me? It's my first day on the job and I'm late. - Terzic, I have a problem, I need your help. I've set you up with a great job and you can't spare five minutes for your friend. Five minutes? - Five minutes! You're like persistent, and I'm like 'no way'. I'm disturbing you. That's right, Terza! Leave it! Peal it yourself! Give it to me. Three palms on the island of happiness where clouds are circling all night... Give me my 10 marks! Wait! What are you doing here? - I live here, what are you doing here? For Nadica and... - Her brother. And her brother. So for Nadica a little serenade! Three secrets, three palms, three shadows our paradise, our sky, our home. and wonderful image of a young woman I've kept in my heart! When you have troubles, when you have problems, you'll always be loved by Gravediggers from the south! I love you Nada, Nadica! Partizan is the champion! If only I had your brain, so I can rest for two days. Excuse me. Hello, madam. Shall we take another one? I don't have any more money. - Neither do I. What do you do when you're not giving yogurts away? And you? - I asked first. I'm studying astronomy. - Astronomy? Cool. - And babysitting at night. In the neighbourhood. - A babysitter. And what are you doing tonight? I'm babysitting. In the neighbourhood. Your door are open. You love when someone is watching you? Someone is touching the curtain. Come, come closer, feel the throbbing of the body. Do whatever do you want to me. I'm your secretary and your shepherdess in the big city. Hello? Agency 1001 sight on the line, We sigh with you and for you all 1440 minutes and 86400 seconds. - Modesty? Yes? - What is such nice girl doing in this place? Who is that? He hanged up. - Fool! I'm here baby! I'm here, I'm here. Here comes the fee. Now everyone follow my foot, that's the line, no one crosses the line! Ladies and gentlemen, no one will lose his turn, just take it easy. Thank you! Would like a cup of coffee now? - I'm not for coffee now. If I could have some cabbage rolls, that would be good. How do you like the painting? - I make such great coffee. My God, no one knows how to make it so good, I let it to boil three times, to have some foam... Alright! Do you like the painting? - Yes, my name is Lepa! It's no use! I have bad batteries. They're so expensive! The money is here! You're a smart young man. You have perspective. I could do so much for you. You're avoiding me. There's no reason for that. Do you need a ride home? No, thank you. Can you give me a ride? I'm so tired. I have work to do, really. What's the problem? Boss, I'm always at your disposal. If you want I can give you a ride. I wanted to... - Go ahead. Can you lend me your apartment? I need it for that chick I talked to you about. Sure. But listen, I was thinking a lot, Seven sins, seven dwarfs and all that. When you steal from a thief that's not a sin, that's a good deed. Do you understand? - What? People in Futura are robbing the poor. Then we rob them, like Robin Hood. And we should give the money to the poor? - We are poor! That's it Momcilo! But I told you that before. - That was more like a tale. But I have a plan. - A plan? - A serious one. They're discovering the fraud at Saturday. That leaves us Friday night. At Saturday morning, we're already abroad. And the most beautiful part, we fucked up the scum! Robbery, robbery, robbery! How will we go trough that agency? You have to hook up with one chick that works at the agency. - Me? What is it, she's a nice girl. - Why don't you hook up with her? I would, but I don't know why would I need you for? To count the money? I have a girlfriend. - Yes, but you're broke. Give me the other one. Children, lemonade, a real one. 300 gr sliced thin, you don't peel of the crust, nothing is thrown away. The one line of lemon, one line of sugar, then it stay still for a week, nothing is rushed... Wait, first the guests. - Thank you. Now you talk about something. It's the 77th minute of Eternal derby. Steam roller has a chance for a counter attack. Zvonko Varga sends a beautiful pass to the most prominent Partizan player, Dragan Mance runs like a bullet across right wing, keeper is on his knees, and goal! Ljukovcan is helpless! The south has exploded, the sky is open! Dragan Mance! Dragan Mance? Stojanovic, Radinovic, Marovic, Jugovic, Belodedic, Najdoski, Prosinecki, Mihajlovic, Pancev, Savicevic and Dragisa Binic. World champions, boy. - Gipsies. How do you know that? I was in Crvena Zvezda for 8 years. - You played football? Football... Aikido! You were practicing aikido? - Get up. Leave that glass. Come here, gravedigger. Don't, you'll get hurt... Can you show me again from the start, I only remembered the bow. My God, a phone hooker. Take this shit away. - I only hope she doesn't have a hairy chest. And that she isn't flabby. Without hairy chest and legs. I hope she has both legs. I found a girlfriend. I'm in love! You could've done this instead of me... Haven't I told you that I can't be at two places at the same time? - Alright! There's no reason to get nervous. At least tell me what she's like. Is she pretty or ugly? - She's pretty. Nice girl, I told you. And she has a good heart. - Yes, she does. Who is this now? Is that her? - No. Alright, this one isn't bad. - Give me, give me. There she is! She's coming to work. Drive, drive, drive! - What is it, Lane? - Drive! Drive! - What is it? She's a nice girl. - Drive! Hello, Mara! Hi! Sister, swear on it! Tell me what happened? Nothing. - What's he's like? - Who? - Him. Him who? - The guy. What guy? - The stud. The hottie. Does he have muscles? A sportsman? His ass? His name is Milan. - And? And he's awfully cute! - And? I don't know. He looks like a moving bush. An orange one. Did something happen? He sang under my window, I gave him a yogurt and he took me out for cakes. Awesome! - Really? Look what I do! You have to earn something in these days. You have an aunt and a brother on your back. Does he have money? - No. He doesn't have any plan in life. He's terribly cute. And you? You have some money? For loan? - No. How are we going to celebrate? - What? - Milan. This is my favourite! - I know. The girl is really nice! She sighs over the phone a bit. And she does it great. - I don't want to have anything with a whore! You will have! You will ask her to work with us, get it? Do you think she's disgusted with money? That's million marks! Alright! I'll do it! I'll work her out! I'll handle the bitch! Hello. - Hello. Am I late? - No, no, no! It's a great crib. Please, sit down. Do you want something to drink? Are you sure? I have to tell you something serious. Heavy shit is all around us. Like you see yourself, a man has to escape from here to stay normal. And we need the money to do that. You see, my friend Moma, who'll you meet later, and me, have figured how to get the money. And we need you for that. - Me? Look, it's an enormous amount. It's not dangerous at all, and it's not legal. We have to rob a bank. - Who? You? Me, you and Moma. All of us together. I know... - What do you know? What do you know? First you sell faceless paintings, then you're wooing me with yogurt, then you're pretending it's raining, and now you want to rob a bank. You're cute. And? Why do you need me for that? Listen now... You... Shit, it's so hot here, are you hot? I'll be right back. We didn't work out that plan all the way. Excuse me. Here you go, that's it. I have to memorize it, and I'm nervous, Moma should come... Let's meet some other time, huh? Alright, we'll meet some other time. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I'm so nervous! I can work on the plan later. Don't be mad at me, please. - I'm not mad. You work on that plan. And we'll meet... tomorrow. So tomorrow? - Bye. I knew it! I knew you won't have the balls to tell her! You nit! What are you doing here, you idiot? You've been listening? 'I'll handle the bitch! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry'. You pussy! What do you want from me? Yes, I'm in love, so what? You're telling me that we have to get in the bank trough her whore agency! And what will she think? That I'm spying on her and she'll dump me! Wait a minute, pal, I can't do that. I have to get closer with her, to earn her trust. You're right. It would be the best if you marry her, so you get close with her. So we start the robbery on your 10th anniversary. Here, wear this jacket. - Is there a toilet here? - I don't know. What is that? - That's Moma, he likes to shoot, but he's normal. Come on. Hi, Moma. - Hello. You're the bank guard. - They call me Moma. Let's sit down. Do you want some coffee? - Sure. It'll boil soon. So we're supposed to rob a bank that you guard? - That's right. Did you plan to use fire arm in that action? No. We won't need this. And you need me for that? - You're essential! And? And? Listen now, When you rob a robber, that's a good deed. You take from the rich ones and give it to the poor, which means us. Is that right? We're poor. - Lane, come here. Come! What's wrong with you? - Why? - What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Do you want me to tell her? - No, not you, she'll think we're taking advantage of her. Lane, look. How do I look? - Put that away. - Wait a minute. Lane, look... How do I look? - Put the weapon down! I won't put it down, I want to hear the plan! The plan is that we all go for a drink, and forget about the whole thing. Why are you mad, I've never held the gun before. And? What's my part? - Slow down. We have to make a test robbery. Without ammunition. I can't put this on my head! You have some other stockings? This one's small! Why didn't you bring a wider one? - I don't have it. You think I need it? Everything's fine, the coast is clear. I gave you weapons, empty! Do you have stocking? - Look what she brought, I can't put it on! - Alright! Do you have it? - I won't use it. - You won't? - You know how ugly do I look with it? Lane, please handle this! - Alright, let's go for a drink, and we'll see. This is a robbery! - Nobody move! That's right! Don't anyone move! I'll kill you all! Give me the money! That's it? Come on. - Come on, faster! Come on, faster! - That's right! Faster! Faster! - Is that all? Give me the cake! Lie down! Everybody down! That's right, everybody down! - No one move for 15 more minutes! Forgive us for the stress you've been trough, we won't need this. Thank you and goodbye. 'Hands up! Give me the cake!' Take that wig off. - Lane got scared! I didn't! - You did, you pussy! I just got confused, that was my first robbery. Unlike us, who rob on daily basis. What's up genius! You got some tan today. Fuck the tan, I sit on that roof, I have to paint, I have to make an audition, I don't have the model. Hi, hi... Hello, natural disaster. Hello there... What? No way, forget about it. - What? What is it? Why are being an idiot. She will be a great model. I mean it. She doesn't have to get naked, I'll imagine it. - He needs a model for his billboard. You won't imagine anything. Forget about it and that's it! Then I'll paint you, you pussy! Topless! Alright, and now what? Now is the robbery plan. Colleague, will you or should I? I will. I enter the bank trough the vent hole, Moma is alone in the corridor when the money arrives. He takes the money. Then I show up from the vent hole, with identical bags that we will fill up with newspapers earlier. We switch the bags, Moma puts the fake bags in the safe, and I take off with the money. - What should I do then? One end of that vent hole is in the bank. And the other end is... Where you work. What do you mean 'on my workplace'? In the agency. - I what agency? In your agency. So that's why you need me? - There, I knew it you'll think that, I knew it! You don't love me at all! - I do! - You just want to make us of me! You've been lying to me this whole time! - And you never lied to me? 'I'm studying astrophysics'! Like hell! And then... And you jumped to pose nude right away, you cunt! Yes, throw it at me! Nadica! Wait, Nadica! Hey, stop Nadica! Nadica, please wait! Come on, please! What's wrong? Nadica! Nadica! Are you alone? - It's you... Where have you been? Moma and Lane are looking for you like crazy people. I don't care. So you are alone? - I'm alone. Come in. Fuck it, I'm still looking for a solution. Where will that billboard be? - On the bank rooftop. Is that very visible? Well, for half of the city. Great. No, no, that's out of the question. No way! Lane would kill me. - Don't say that name. Anymore! Never! - Anyway, he would kill me. He will see! Come on! Lane... My brother, forgive me. Hello? Is it him? Come on, come on! Laki? I have to tell you something. You know... Nada... - What? What about Nada? - I mean... Did you make up? We didn't... She doesn't want to see me. No hope. Total shit. And Moma too, he drinks all day long and waters flowers. Absurd. My good brother! The only one! You're the only one who I have now. I know you'd never screw me over. I can play the natural disaster again and we can ask for forgiveness. I don't give a fuck. What will you do? I though you could call her... - Me? Why me? What should I tell her? You call her and ask her to be your model. That's stupid! - It's not stupid, wait. You call her, not to be the model, just so I can meet with her. That's what you thought? That's stupid too... Nadica? - Shut up! Let me go! Alright, but please let me explain. I don't care! Move over so I can go. - I won't move. I won't! Please, please, listen to me. - I won't listen to you! You won't have to listen, but I'll still talk and you do what you want! I swear, I met you before any idea about the robbery! Alright, is that all? Are you finished? - No, I'm not finished, if you'll allow me. I liked you first, then Moma thought all that about the robbery. I didn't woe you for the vent hole. Move, we'll sink! I don't believe you anything anymore! I won't go to any robbery! I don't care! Forget about the robbery! I only care about you. And I don't care where you work, or what you do! I love you, how can you not see that? I love you! I don't care. You don't care about anything! Let me go out. - Watch your manners. Lane, we'll sink because of you! - Come here. Let me show you a spot on this raft where there's no rocking. I knock to director's door, she unlocks the safe, I put fake bags in, she locks the safe. I come back to the agency with the money, I pick up Nadica, we leave. And Samantha stays tied up. Then Nadica kisses Lane, We leave the message for Sabrina: - 'Mara, the switchboard broke, it won't be repaired until tomorrow. We have a few days off, I'll call you for the movie. Nadica.' - Without the movie. - Alright. ' Mara, the switchboard broke. - Fine! Like very day I finish my work at 20:00. You wait for me. And tomorrow at 10:00, director, Rankovic and Pendula are coming to the bank. I'm not there. They're surprised. The director unlocks the safe, to check the money. She opens the bags, and in there... And then... Greece, Cairo, Sinai, Goa, Thailand, Tokyo, L.A, Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Brazil! We forgot the Mauritius! Please don't sigh for me, give me Modesty, it's Moma. Keep talking as usual, I'm just checking did he arrive and I see that he didn't. Out. What is it? What's my sister like? What do you say? What are you doing here? Get out. - Take me to the robbery, I know the plan. What plan? Get out! - You're incompetent, you have no gas and you'll rob something! There's no robbery! Get the fuck out! - Please, take me with you! Please! When I catch you! I'm here, I'm here. I'm lying on the mattress while the sun bathes me. My legs are nude, oiled with coconut oil. I'm here, I'm here. Bottom part of my bathing suit is a jessamine leaf. Topside is a cherry. I'm your... Why are you late? - What should I do to you know? What? Are you insane? Quiet! Stop yelling! - Are you crazy? What is that on the rooftop? Lane, please don't act stupid. - You could've just put you pussy on the flier and shared! I could kill you now, I swear! Such a shame! Listen boys, the boss contacted us. I have to go to a meeting. We're arranging a big business with a big world company. So today we won't get the money from the branches, understand? You manage things alone today. Anyway, we'll close soon. Ciao! - Stop! You can't! I won't let you! You're going abroad with people's money? - What's with you? Why are you crazy? Where is the money? Where is my investment? Where's my money? I'll kill you, I swear! Please, put the gun down. - I can smell a crook right away! Give me your gun. - Don't be a fool! Don't piss me off! - Hands up! Be still! Give me your gun! Be still, be still! I'll shoot, I swear! - Will you shoot? Then shoot. - I'll kill you and you'll be sorry! - Come on, shoot! Kostic, don't make me to commit a crime, I'll kill you, I swear! Shoot on three. One, two, three. Moma, my kitten! I offered you to join the job. But now it's not too late either, kitten. You do realize that all of this was a big scam, there was no investment. The boss was transferring the money abroad, and the he went abroad too. That was the plan all along. But, kitten, the most important thing, is that the money from last week was given to branch directors. To me! Look! There's enough so we can enjoy the rest of our lives. You and me. Bahamas. Acapulco! I hope the car is ready! - That idiot turned the alarm on. Hey, hello Pendula! Where have you been? Bye, kitten! Lane! Lane! What's going on here? Quiet! What's going on here? - They were shooting inside! Who shot? - I don't know! Untie me! Lane! Lane! What's going on? - I don't know what's going on! What's with him? - He's fine. You have the money! What's going on? Where's Pendula? It's unlocked! Drop your weapon, hands up! Where? No, there's police there too! We can, there's an exit there! Where does this lead? - Come on! For fuck's sake! - Your exit is great! I knew it, I knew it! - Don't panic! Go check for some passage. What should I do? - Take the money. - Where should I go? - Over there! So many cops... What happened? - What happened? A thousand cops is looking at your tits! I asked you what happened! - We're screwed, that's what happened! Let's surrender... - I won't surrender! Look how much money is here! Find some exit, think of something! What are we going to do now? - Why are you worried? You're immortalized, here 3x6, great, you don't have to care. Heaven on Earth! - Laki! Lane... What are you doing here? Bro, let me explain, that wasn't my idea. I swear, you know I wouldn't do that. If she'd come now and explain... That was all her idea. What are you doing here? - I'm sleeping... I mean, finishing this billboard! What time is it? Moma, someone is robbing your bank! You robbed the bank? You're insane! Come down, quick! - Where? - At grandma Lepa! Where? - At grandma Lepa! Hello? Come in, over. He's running away! Get him! It's alright, I was just kidding. It's alright, hey! Here, trough the window, on the stairs and trough the back exit. There's no exit, huh? - There wasn't any, I swear! Your billboard is great! - My brother! - Laki, don't hold the grudge! Cunt! - Ah, fuck it... - This is for you! And if it's not enough? Good evening! Will these friends of yours come back? Should I make coffee? - I don't think so. So sweet one for everyone? Right away. Fucking hell! I don't have the juice! Next time when you go to rob call me and you'll have the juice! What are you doing here? Don't hug and kiss me, you better give me some money. Hey kittens, good morning! Enough with these payments, people! Good morning, Nadica. Who didn't brush their teeth this morning? Woman, to the sea! - I can't... - Momcilo! I'll race you! You'll return all the money? I can't believe it. Not everything, Lane. - Don't worry, we kept more than enough. Maybe a bit more. Listen, I already have a few combinations. We'll make wonders with the money we kept. I can't enjoy when I'm feeling guilty. Anyway, what should we do with all that money? There's nothing to buy here anyway. Alright, people, fine! I saw a small bank or a post office in the village yesterday, it has a reedy roof and there's a palm tree above it. So I though we can bust trough the roof and smash guard's head with a coconut!
