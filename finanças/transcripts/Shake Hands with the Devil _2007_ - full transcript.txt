[church bells ringing] - [Woman] I think you'll have to answer the question you raised yesterday. Do you want to continue living? [soft guitar music] ♪ Africa ♪ ♪ Africa ♪ [singing in foreign language] [women chattering] [singing in foreign language] ♪ Africa ♪ Gentlemen, let me introduce the military commander of our next mission, General Romeo Dallaire. Under Secretary General Annan is now in charge of U.N. peacekeeping operations. Welcome to the United Nations assistance mission in Rwanda, or as it surely will be called, UNAMIR from now on. I'm honored Mr. Under Secretary. [singing in foreign language] ♪ Africa ♪ ♪ Africa ♪ ♪ Africa ♪ Nobody told me how damn beautiful it was gonna be. [speaking in foreign language] Perfect. War has a terrible momentum. It challenges all human attempt to stop it once it's unleashed. But with courage and determination, it can be done. Speaking for the world body of the United Nations, I wanna congratulate the people of Rwanda and their leaders for their courage and their determination to create a just and enduring peace after a long and tragic conflict. And as peacekeepers we are honored that you have asked us to serve your best intentions and your highest hopes, and we will do everything in our power to nourish the spirit of trust and respect that is evident here today. [spectators applaud] - [Man] Come on soldiers, go right, go right. Continue slowly. - [Man] Come on, move it soldiers, move it. Nice to meet you, General. Brent, this is General Anyidoho. General, this is my personal staff officer, Major Brent Beardsley. Welcome to UNAMIR, gentlemen. We come here from a dozen different countries to help Rwanda find peace and security. They've had 30 years of conflict, often violent and brutal. And now both sides wanna find a way to a lasting peace. So, here we are, Rwanda. That's Zaire, Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda. Three years ago the rebel army invaded from up here, Uganda, and began a civil war. They're mostly, not completely, but mostly Tutsi exiles from Rwanda. They're tryin' to come home again. Today they control this far northern area of the country. Last March when the cease fire agreement was reached, a demilitarized zone was created here. Patrolling that DMZ is a major part of our mission here as peacekeepers and our first duty is to be impartial. We're referees, not coaches, and definitely not players. By the way, our weapons are for show, gentlemen. We don't even have enough rounds for target practice. We're here to create a climate of security, to stabilize the situation, not to create a permanent solution. That's their job. Somebody said that peacekeeping is not a soldier's job, but only a soldier can do it. When you're a peacekeeper, you're doin' one of the toughest military jobs on earth. But it can be done. [speaking in foreign language] Where there's a will, there's a way. [chattering in foreign language] [singing in foreign language] [shoppers and merchants chattering] [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Two years ago they tried to kill me. They sent some Interahamwe but they just beat us instead. Me and my family. The Gendarmes stayed outside to make sure nobody would try to help us. She doesn't understand English. [speaking in foreign language] No. [speaking in foreign language] [ominous orchestral music] - [Soldier] Mic Niner, this Mic Eight. We are now going off [mumbles], over. [suspenseful orchestral music] You say these are their children? [flies buzzing] Who did this? [speaking in foreign language] He said they told him that it was the rebels who did it. Which is true, that's what they told him. But he kept repeating the same word. [speaking in foreign language] So finally they said [speaking in foreign language], that's their word for the rebels. And? And that place is well into Hutu territory. Why would Tutsi rebels go all that way just to murder and rape six kids? [suspenseful orchestral music] [soldiers chattering in foreign language] Pleasure to meet you, General Kagame. General. Young Hutus have been killed. They're accusing you of being responsible. Also, our observers have been reporting a lot of cease fire violations near the DMZ by your men. I can't hold my forces back forever. Because of that the other side's blaming you for holding up the formation of a new government. They keep changing the rules. They don't want to share power with us. Can't you see they're stalling? We decide to resume hostilities, I'll give you 24 hours notice. Is that a warning? No, a promise. But I am warning you, something terrible is coming and once it starts nobody will be able to stop it. I'm afraid many people will die. [men chattering] [speaking in foreign language] [ominous orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music] [singing in foreign language] [crowd chattering] [orchestral music] - [Romeo] I have these, what do you call 'em, flashbacks. And they're not like memories at all. I'm back in Kigali. I'm talking to someone. It's as real as sitting in the room? [singing in foreign language] I thought you liked parties, sir. I hate parties, but it's how you play the game. [singing in foreign language] Did I say something? Do you know what he said to me? He told me that the only way to deal with the Tutsis is to eliminate them, to wipe them out completely. [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] This informer, Jean-Pierre, told my officer that the Hutu extremists are hiding weapons all over town. Caches of guns, machetes, grenades. These are photos of an arms cache on the ground floor of the party headquarters. The president's party headquarters. Tell me about this guy. Make it make sense. This Jean-Pierre is a leader of the Interahamwe. Very high up. He takes his orders directly from the head of the ruling party. He says they asked him to locate all the Tutsis living in Kigali and then make a list of their addresses. Every Tutsi in Kigali? He says then they realized that there's going to be a slaughter of the innocents and his conscience can not accept that. He says his mother is a Tutsi. He says they are organized to kill a thousand Tutsis every 20 minutes. And you believe him? I believe him when he says his job is to hand out weapons to the militia cells. He claims he's in charge of arms caches like this all over the city and he's marked them on this map. And what does he expect to get outta this? Safe passage out of the country. Passports for himself and his family. He has money, they're paying him well, but he wants his Rwandan francs changed into U.S. dollars. Okay. Here's what we do. We confirm his story. Then we raid some of these places in the next 36 hours. We get a lot of guns out of circulation and we throw a scare into these bastards as well. Today we stop playing catch up, gentlemen. We're gonna take the initiative. We can throw the Hutu power extremists off balance for a change. [men grunt in agreement] We have the manpower to put together three teams and hit three of these caches simultaneously. [men chattering] About time. So let's make it fast and noisy. We'll shake up the bad boys [men clapping] and make sure the word gets out all over the country as well as back to New York that they've been busted. - [Men] Yeah! [men applauding] What is it? Sir, I think you need to read this. Let's take a break. When the fuck did this come in? It was here when I came into the office this morning. No, that's what it says. No, stop, do not, mission denied. I sure as hell don't remember asking their fucking permission. Seizing illegal arms is well within our mandate. They're saying no to everything? Not only that, now I'm supposed to tell him. Tell who? Tell the president we've heard his best friends have been stashing weapons. I'm supposed to, I am required, to tell Habyarimana that a shitload of weapon is hidden in his own party headquarters. Oh and one more thing, we can not offer asylum to our informer. [speaking in foreign language] Ah, General Dallaire. Mr. Booh-booh says that you're gonna let this ride for the moment, huh? I agree that that's the best policy. Since Mogadishu we've learned not to rush into things. 18 American casualties, wasn't it? 18 dead Rangers are a lot, General, when they show up all at once on the nightly news. And still you must have been pretty shocked to learn there are so many illegal weapons being stockpiled in Kigali. Yes. Well, yes, I was shocked. General I was personally very shocked by these allegations. Oh yes, yes indeed. - [Romeo] There was so much I didn't know and I always had the feeling everybody knew more than I did. It was like I was confirming what they already knew. [dramatic orchestral music] [speaking in foreign language] [crowd shouting] - [Brent] What the hell is going on here? They caught some Tutsi persons trying to slip out of the compound. Okay, let's go. Come on! [speaking in foreign language] [crowd shouting] Hey! Back, back! [crowd shouting] Okay, let's go. Go! Back! [crowd shouting] [speaking in foreign language] Back away. Back away! Back! [fist thuds] [crowd shouting] Go. Move, move, move! The Security Council passed a new resolution, Romeo. Resolution 909. We want your evacuation contingency plan and as soon as possible. What do you mean my evacuation plan? Who said this mission's over? I didn't say it was over. Your mandate has been extended for six weeks, but if a transition government is not in place by then, then [speaking in foreign language]. You know what I think, Maurice? I think this is like saying to a bunch of kids we're fighting with knives, you better stop or the babysitter's gonna leave. You're there to keep peace, not make it. If both sides don't want it-- - [Romeo] There are a hell of a lot of people here who want peace. They want peace, they want security, they want democracy. We also want you to find ways of reducing costs. Romeo? Are you there? - [Romeo] That'll go on the very top of my list, Maurice. Romeo, wait. I-- Au revoir, Maurice. [phone beeps] We have six weeks. What's today? April 6th. May 18th. How do you do that? I mean, just like that? [Brent chuckles] Okay. The president could come back tonight ready to deal. The other governments are putting a lot of pressure on him to install the transitional government. It's our last chance. But why not be optimistic? - [Henry] You always were an optimist. - [Luc] You honestly believed that we could make it work. Didn't you? Sure I did. At the outset. You were doing a remarkable job. It was always a gamble, and when you gamble sometimes you are dealt a very bad hand. [airplane rumbling] [explosion booms] What the? [explosion booms] What was that? - [Man] An ammo dump? - [Romeo] If this place blows up, God help us. [gunfire popping] - [Man On Radio] All stations, this is Zero. Did everyone just hear an explosion in the general area [phone rings] of the territory? Over. General Dellaire's residence, may I... Hang on. A plane just crashed at Kigali Airport. It was coming in to land. It may have been the president's plane. [phone ringing] [sirens blaring] [gunfire popping] [speaking in foreign language] Madame Agathe. [speaking in foreign language] Get me Colonel Marchal. He's on the radio, sir. [suspenseful orchestral music] Colonel, I want you to send in patrol to secure the crash site, over. [speaking in foreign language] Stay with the radio. [speaking in foreign language] [men chuckle] General. [speaking in foreign language] [suspenseful orchestral music] Send an escort to Madame Agathe's house. She may need extra security. [men chattering] - [Man On Radio] The situation seems to be getting worse. [speaking in foreign language] [gunfire popping] [suspenseful orchestral music] [men chattering] [speaking in foreign language] [man cries out] [speaking in foreign language] [woman crying out] [speaking in foreign language] [machete thudding] What about our observers up here? Has anybody heard from them? Sir, it says urgent. Everything's urgent for the moment, Corporal. I think it's very, very urgent, sir. This is insane. The force commander has instructed that the rules of engagement are to be strictly followed. Under no circumstances is UNAMIR to fire until fired upon. We can not take the offensive, not even to prevent the slaughter of the innocent. - [Man] You can't be serious. - [Romeo] Send that to our commanders right now. Sir. [gunfire popping] [speaking in foreign language] - [Brent] The use of deadly force is prohibited unless we are under attack. Repeat, we can not fire unless we are fired upon. Yes, I hear you. Shitty news. Roger out. [ominous music] Get me Lieutenant Colonel Lewis. [explosion booms] [glass breaks] [suspenseful orchestral music] [speaking in foreign language] It hasn't stopped one minute, sir. Everybody needs protection. Tell them to stay home. - [Soldier] Yes, General, but they... It's the Prime Minister, sir. She needs to talk to you. - [Soldier] They're being attacked in their homes. Tell them to hide. [men shouting] [suspenseful orchestral music] [speaking in foreign language] [children shouting] [guns firing rapidly] [somber music] [singing in foreign language] Sir. Sir. [singing in foreign language] General Kagame, this is General Dallaire. We are prepared to secure Kigali, General, but the killings will not stop at once. I shall order my troops to intervene. [suspenseful orchestral music] This is a declaration of war, General. That means even more killing. The government must stop murdering Tutsis or we will attack. Tell them they have until sunset. [men chattering] - [Man] Roger and out. [explosions booming] [gunfire popping] [speaking in foreign language] - [Man On Radio] [mumbles], over. The situation seems to be getting-- If you see roadblocks in that area, over. [men chattering] [ominous orchestral music] General. General. General Dallaire, these people won't let us through, sir. The men and I are very uneasy about this. No kidding. Okay, just stay put. [suspenseful orchestral music] [speaking in foreign language] Try to find another way around. Come on, we're gonna walk in. [speaking in foreign language] [guns clicking] Keep walking. [suspenseful orchestral music] [speaking in foreign language] [frenetic orchestral music] [speaking in foreign language] [suspenseful orchestral music] [mumbles], sir. They're holding five of our men. They have a bunch of Belgians over at Camp Kigali. They say they are beating them. [speaking in foreign language] Stay put 'til I come back. Keep an eye on these guys. If there's something, find me. [speaking in foreign language] See if you can find Maggen. [gunfire popping] On second thought, stay here. Who knows what the hell's goin' on. General Dallaire here. Put me through to General Anyidoho. More bad news, sir, they're killing everyone. All the moderate politicians and their families. And even Hutus who tried to help the Tutsis. The city's in chaos. Everywhere Tutsis are trying to find refuge. I'm trying to get them to the UNAMIR compounds. I don't have enough men. At least 35 of our people are missing. Have you spoken to Marchal? We can't get through. The lines are jammed. They've got some of our Belgians at Camp Kigali. I saw them on the ground. On the ground, sir? The question is what the hell can we do? I hope you're not thinking about a rescue mission. They are not the only ones missing, General. We have hundreds of other unarmed observers out there. If we become belligerent it will be the death of them. Besides, we can't do it. We don't have fire power. We have almost no ammunition. Yeah, I know. I won't send in a rescue mission. I'm trying to negotiate with Bagosora. [speaking in foreign language] [men shouting in foreign language] [man mumbles] [speaking in foreign language] [men moaning] [speaking in foreign language] [women crying] [men moaning] [speaking in foreign language] [flies buzzing] [speaking in foreign language] [somber music] [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Do you have your camera? [speaking in foreign language] Have someone guard them until we pick them up. [singing in foreign language] - [Man] Stop! Stop! Stop! [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - [Man On Radio] Mic Zero. Thousands are fleeing to UNAMIR's compound. The Bangladeshis at the stadium say they're overrun. Please inform Foxtrot Niner. Out. [crowd shouting] Open up. This is our encampment, General. These people should not be here. They have no right to be here. Why do they choose to come here? Maybe they believe you'll protect them. Try acting like that's true, Commander. That's an order. Come with me. [crowd shouting] [speaking in foreign language] [baby crying] [crowd chattering] Sir. [somber orchestral music] [children crying] [gunfire popping] One of the men went back to the house. There's nothing left. No clothing, no furniture. No nothing. What about Shithead? No sign of the dog, sir. Or the goat or the chicken. - [Woman] Sir, General Baril is on the line. - [Brent] Are you hungry, sir? I found a chocolate bar. - [Romeo] Sir, this is General Dallaire. Did you say thousands? Thousands, that's right. We have refugees in all our compounds. I'm not gonna give 'em up without a fight. Of course. Most of the moderate leaders are dead, but not all of 'em. There are lots of moderates left, even in the army. Romeo, you are not to take sides. Do you understand that? Do you hear me? You are not to take sides, Romeo. We'll talk tomorrow. I hope by then I can give you some direction. [explosion booms] - [Newscaster] At least 10 Belgian peacekeepers were killed in Rwanda today as terror convulsed the capital of this tiny African nation. Reporters describe thousands of refugees fleeing Kigali while government backed radio continues to broadcast hate messages that encourage the wholesale murder of the Tutsi minority. [explosion booms] [gunfire popping] General. It's getting worse, Henry, not better. We're getting reports of killings coming in from the north and west. That's the Hutu power heart line. Meanwhile, we're almost out of food, no water, no fuel. General, Kagame's troops crossed into the DMZ one hour ago. Our mandate is over, General. There is no more peace to keep. [somber piano music] I need three more battalions and logistic support. Just three more battalions will enable us to protect the people who need our protection. They say that's not part of our mandate, so what? We just had a disaster fall on us here. We have to do what we can. Very well, General. [crowd shouting] [speaking in foreign language] It's protected by the United Nations. General, we have a problem outside. [speaking in foreign language] [crowd shouting] The Interahamwe have set up a gate outside. [whistle blowing] [men chattering] [speaking in foreign language] [men shouting in foreign language] We'd better get some armed troops here as soon as we can. That's one brave son of a bitch. [men shouting in foreign language] Sir. Sir. General Baril. [gunfire popping] Romeo, the French are going to be landing a military force in Kigali in 45 minutes. What the? They'll be followed by Belgium. Hey, Maurice, I don't control the damn airport. 45 minutes? Why the hell-- They just told me. Listen, Romeo. They're coming only to evacuate ex-patriots, that's all. [speaking in foreign language] Okay, thanks. [speaking in foreign language] General Dallaire, General Kagame would like to know why you don't use your weapons to stop the killings. He wants to know why I don't-- Why you don't order your men to open fire. So, General Kagame believes that our force or 2300 lightly armed men should attack a heavily armed force of 32,000? He has very daring ideas, your friend, General Kagame. But a show of force, sir. Force is not a show, mademoiselle, when you're confronting a professional army. It's war. You see, unlike General Kagame I'm a soldier under orders and my orders are to use force only in self-defense. If I did otherwise, I'd be relieved of my command and court-martialed. Are you expecting new orders, sir? At the moment we're expecting nothing but the unexpected, mademoiselle, and you should do the same. Be careful where you go. [crowd shouting] [explosions booming] [speaking in foreign language] We've organized a convoy. We're going south to Burundi. Thank you for the escort. We've heard Uncle Sam is sending you some Marines as well. News to me, General. You know, if we had a couple of battalions of U.S. Marines I think we could stop this bloodbath. There's no way Washington's gonna put troops on the ground in Rwanda, General. No way. [explosion booms] It's been good working with you, sir. [explosion booms] [gunfire popping] We can't take our local staff. We'll never get 'em past the Hutus controlling the border. You represent the most powerful nation on earth. Never mind, just send them to us. We can always make room for a few more. Peter? This way. - [Woman] Peter! [dog barking] What's that? Identity card. All Tutsi. Tried to burn, make disappear these people. Mens, womens, and childrens. It was army and gendarmerie. They round up all Tutsis in area and put them in church. They tell them they will be safe here then they invite local militia to come and kill them with machete. He, um... They put the gun to his head, make him watch. [church bell rings] [singing in foreign language] The men who were there said the killers were working together, the gendarmerie and the local civilians. Methodical is the word they used. Is extermination, General. Like the Jews. [singing in foreign language] We were seeing genocide getting underway, but we didn't know to call it that yet. And anyway, genocide, that's freight trains and concentration camps and gas ovens, not somebody picking up a machete and walking across to his neighbor's house and cutting off arms and legs. Dear Mr. Secretary, we have reliable reports of systematic killings of Tutsi non-combatants. Not just here in Kigali, but all over the country. There are 600 French para commandos working out of the airport. There are a thousand Belgian para commandos, half of them already in Kigali, half staging in Nairobi. There are 350 U.S. Marines in Burundi, only half an hour's helicopter flight away. We could stop these killings now. Good evening, General Dallaire. Yes, I am the spokesman for the Secretary General. He said he could not speak with you personally but he thought it important that you get this news at once. General Dallaire, the Belgian government has decided to withdraw its peacekeeping forces from Rwanda. All of them? - [Spokesman] Yes, all of them and as soon as possible. I told him, don't do this. I said we are deserting our mission. It's a shameful thing to do. You stayed well beyond your orders, Colonel. Your men are good men. I guess we can learn to survive without you. I'll miss ya, bastard, just the same. They court-martialed you. Mm-hm. For the loss of my men, of course. My judge was more merciful than yours. [alarm bell ringing] [explosions booming] [crowd shouting] May I say thank you from all of us? Thank you for what you've done for the mission and for the people of Rwanda. [explosion booms] Goodbye. Colonel. Goodbye and God bless you all. [explosions booming] [gunfire popping] Okay, hold on. The stadium took a direct hit. More than 12 people killed, over a hundred wounded. [explosion booms] [suspenseful orchestral music] There's a shell up there. Unexploded. 81 millimeter mortar bomb. I'll take care of it, General. [suspenseful orchestral music] Let's back away. He's tryin' to kill himself. We have to send him home. - [Brent] Sir. I see. I'm to have a ceasefire in place by 10 a.m. tomorrow New York time and begin a withdrawal. - [Brent] That's four o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Get me Bagosora. [suspenseful music] [gun firing] Go, go, go! Floor it! Okay, relax. [speaking in foreign language] [somber orchestral music] [gunfire popping] [explosions booming] [gunfire popping] [phone ringing] Yes? General, Secretary Boutros-Ghali wishes to speak to you. General, I hope I didn't wake you. - [Romeo] No, Mr. Secretary, I was expecting your call. Is there a ceasefire in place? No, sir. - [Boutros] We were clear about a deadline, were we not? Yes, sir. The deadline has passed with no result. Therefore, General-- Sir. There are 30,000 people who have survived because they're under our protection. They will be killed if we leave. Do not order me to withdraw our forces here, sir. [gunfire popping] - [Boutros] I'm afraid I must give you that order, General, and I expect you to obey. Respectfully, Mr. Secretary, that's an order I will not obey. [somber orchestral music] [gunfire popping] [explosions booming] [singing in foreign language] Civilians can not understand what it means to disobey an order. In the military obedience is everything. My duty is duty. It's like a priest who breaks his vows. Did I disobey their order? I don't know. I remember it one way, maybe they remember it differently. I just got off the phone with the Secretary General and he's going to let you stay on there but with a reduced force. A very reduced force, Romeo. It'll be very dangerous if either side should turn on you, because if you do have to get out in a hurry, well, there's no cavalry over the hill and... I've just been to a meeting of the security council. Romeo, no one will be coming in to get you out. Who cares? [explosion booms] We're not goin' anywhere anyway. I don't know what you've heard, gentlemen, but UNAMIR is staying on. Our numbers will be reduced considerably. We have four days of supplies to last us indefinitely and a few vehicles which will still run if we can find some fuel. [men chuckle] We're gonna stay to protect the innocent as best we can and as best we can to make sure humanitarian aid gets through. We're gonna stay to bear witness to what the rest of the world doesn't wanna see. Yes, Major. Reduced to what? 260 men. 260 volunteers, 'cause if anybody wants to go, they can go. We Canadians are staying. We've never been defeated and this will not be the first time. Thank you, General. - [Henry] Thanks, sir. Thank you all. [speaking in foreign language] [door slams] - [Emma] Hey! - [Romeo] You need a ride? Yes, desperately. Thank you, General. If you leave now I don't know when you'll be able to get back in. I'm not sure we are coming back. They want us in Bosnia. That's a big story right now according to them. Bosnia, Sarajevo. They don't understand what's going on here. I don't think they wanna understand. This is just one more African mess. Their words, General, not mine. [speaking in foreign language] [woman grunts] [woman screaming] Keep your hands inside. [men shouting in foreign language] If you stay here I'll guarantee you a story a day. You will have total access to our operations. You can ride with us and we'll protect you the best we can. You can bed down right here and we'll feed you. I don't care if your story's positive or negative, just so it's accurate. You have to tell the world what's going on here. And keep telling them until they damn well listen. - [Emma] Fighting here makes delivery nearly impossible. 200,000 people have died in a humanitarian catastrophe. This demands urgent action-- You hear that, Brent? - [Emma] The Secretary General said. This demands urgent action. - [Emma] President Clinton told the graduating class of the U.S. Naval Academy that-- Brent? - [Emma] We can not solve every such outburst of civil strikes simply by sending in our troops. Remarks taken as a White House reply to demands for military intervention Shit. - [Emma] in Rwanda. And according to sources, the Pentagon is reluctant... It seems to be a form of cerebral malaria. It's going around the refugee camps. You must get him to a good hospital as soon as possible or we'll lose him. He'll be on a Canadian first thing in the morning. - [Man On Radio] Zero, roger so far. Anything else? Over. [gunfire popping] [ominous orchestral music] Hey. Better live it up while you're there. You've gotta be back in a week. Heck yes. And the refugees were getting sick and dying in the compounds. I had to do something about it. Get rid of some of these chairs, Corporal. First of all I'd like to introduce my new assistant, Mr. Phil Lancaster. Just came from Ottawa. Where I bring greetings from Major Beardsley. Brent's in the hospital there. He's doing fine. Well, he's going to be fine, sir. We're all happy to hear that, Major. Now, let's get last night's [mumbles]. Sir, half an hour ago I got a call from the director of peacekeeping operations in Ottawa. He told me that he'd received some information that you are to be assassinated in the next few days. [Romeo grunts] I've spoken to General Anyidoho about this and he agrees that you'll need some extra security when you leave the compound. - [Henry] General, I've put together a little team. A driver who's been specially trained and marksmen and a few other good men. Jesus, Henry. [Henry laughs] [suspenseful orchestral music] [shouting in foreign language] [rocks thudding] We have thousands of people in that stadium. Quite a few of them are Hutus. They are terrified of your troops. - [Paul] If they are innocent civilians they have nothing to fear. - [Romeo] There are a lot of Tutsis in the [speaking in foreign language] who say they'd feel safer if they could get behind your lines. - [Paul] What are you getting at, General? I'm proposing we do an exchange. Move people out of these [mumbles] to places where they'll feel safer and can take care of themselves. We don't have enough food or water or medicine for the people we're trying to protect. People are dying in our compounds. But if we could transfer them to safer locations we could save a lot of lives. The interim government has agreed to a one for one exchange of noncombatants. What about you? I am fighting a war, General. It's very difficult to say let's stop for a moment. The other side has agreed. They have no momentum to worry about. We're talking about saving the lives of innocent people. I am trying to save my country. And what is that? Those mountains? Those trees? That lake over there? All right. I'll support you in this plan. What about the Interahamwe, General? Have you spoken to their leaders, all three of them? Because I suggest you do that before you start putting unarmed people on trucks. Bring the cars. [somber orchestral music] Take this boy. - [Man] Yes, sir. Wouldn't wanna do anything foolish. [speaking in foreign language] [men chattering in foreign language] They're eager to help us in any of our humanitarian projects. They're proud to be working with us. I shook hands with them. Sycophant. [crowd chattering] Everyone just stand back. - [Man] Don't worry, another truck is coming. Close the gate, please, close the gate. [men singing in foreign language] Foxtrot Niner, this Mama Papa one. Come in Mama Papa. Where are you? Over. Foxtrot, we have a problem. The militia are not letting us through. [men shouting] I thought we had a deal with the Interahamwe. Roger, out. [speaking in foreign language] I shoulda shot them. How many lives would I have saved if I'd done that? And how many lives would it have cost? Don't put this on your list of failures, General. Those transfers saved a lot of people. Not enough. Never enough. [chanting in foreign language] It made me feel better. I didn't do it to kill myself or anything like that. Actually, it was the opposite. I did it because it felt good. Took away the pain. [trucks rumbling] [suspenseful music] I want you to send this. I've outlined what can be done if the Security Council reinforces us. A new United Nations assistance mission to Rwanda. UNAMIR 2, stop the genocide right now. You're a hopeful man, General. I wish I felt the same way. I always thought that despair is the sin that can not be forgiven. [explosion booms] [alarm bells ringing] It's a good piece of work, Romeo. [speaking in foreign language] a complete plan, military, [explosion booms] military and political. We're going to pass it along to the Security Council at once. [explosion booms] It's too late today, though. Tomorrow's Friday, so the fastest they can get to it will be Monday. [explosions booming] Do they know how many people are gonna die here between now and Monday? What? I said [explosion booms] do they know how many people are gonna die here between now and Monday? I can't hear you. [explosion booms] [alarm bells ringing] - [Man] Get down! - [Man] Get back! Get back! Move! So, what's the damage? - [Henry] One dead, nobody injured. We've almost lost all the vehicles and the radio transmitter. - [Romeo] What about the generator? The generator is intact, General. General, it's the hospital. Dallaire, here. - [Man] They fired on into the hospital compound, over. Who fired those rounds? - [Man] The rebels. Come and see for yourself, General, over. Coming right now. [explosion booms] [speaking in foreign language] [children crying] [people chattering] [speaking in foreign language] [somber orchestral music] [woman screaming] [men shouting] [woman screaming] [man crying out] [woman screaming] [machete thudding into flesh] [boy coughs] [goats bleating] [somber orchestral music] - [Romeo] Could you help me with these, please. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [goats bleating] I need something to stay alive around here. Take care of her. Yes, sir. Don't worry, General. General Dallaire, it's been almost a month since the United Nations Security Council adopted your resolution. Have any of those troops arrived yet? Have you received any of the support or supplies promised by this resolution? [camera beeps] Shit, I'm outta tape. [Emma mumbles] Hell no they haven't sent anymore troops yet. Or fuel or food or bandages. And believe me, the Americans are working like beavers to make sure as little as possible is done in the long run. Why is that, General? They've been fighting using the word genocide from day one because under international law it requires them to act. By the way, the UK's going along with them on this policy. General Anyidoho says they're estimating the death toll at 500,000. Meanwhile the Interahamwe are saying they can't guarantee the security of our refugee transfers anymore. [gun fires] I can hear 'em. [gun fires] But I can't see 'em. - [Man On Radio] Zero copy. - [Phil] Those trucks'll be here any minute. Sir, careful. - [Man On Radio] Has learned that several shells have landed in the immediate area of [mumbles]. One team of military observers, Mic Four, has been dispatched to assess the situation and you are to proceed there immediately. [suspenseful orchestral music] You make a pretty good target there, sir. [gun fires] - [Man On Radio] Zero and Mic Six, this is Mic Four. [gun clicks] [speaking in foreign language] [suspenseful orchestral music] [trucks rumbling] The civil war continues as the rebel army sweeps through the country and government forces continue to retreat. Under pressure from the leaders of nearby African states, both sides claim to be trying to work out terms for a ceasefire under the auspices of UNAMIR. These negotiations are being held in Kigali, a city surrounded and under siege by General Kagame's troops. Meanwhile there are reports that France is considering intervention in the Rwandan situation. This is Emma Baker, Nightly News, Kigali. Excuse me, Dr. Kouchner, can we have a moment of your time, sir? No, no. Sorry, not right now. Do you honestly believe that your government is proposing this for humanitarian reasons? Yes, of course. Bullshit! The reason France wants to come in now is to save your old clients 'cause they're losing the war, Doctor. They're on the run. But if their French friends arrive just in time, they may hold on to a few square miles of territory and still call themselves the government of Rwanda. You know the first people France saved here? The people who planned this genocide. I saw them get on the plane to Paris. France sold them the weapons. France trained the presidential guards. France stood back for 72 days and let a Rwandan protege try to exterminate the Tutsi and the Hutu moderates. Is that what you call a humanitarian mission nowadays, Dr. Kouchner? No one else has volunteered to intervene. How dare you oppose this proposal? How do they dare to make it? [door clicks] General, we need to see you outside here, right away. Excuse me. [men shouting in foreign language] Some government troops fired on a Tutsi convoy so the RPF has arrested the whole government delegation, says they're taking them hostage. This is madness. [speaking in foreign language] Calm down! Everybody, just calm down! Frank! [men shouting] Frank, tell your people to call off this nonsense. Nobody's gonna be taken hostage. Nobody's under arrest unless it's you. This is my compound and I give the orders here! Tell that to Kagame! Call your boss! [speaking in foreign language] Calm down, calm down. Calm down. It'll calm down. It's okay. Easy. It's over, calm down. [speaking in foreign language] It's over. This is going to happen whether I like it or not, isn't it? I came here to tell you about it, that's all. No, that's not all. I need your help. I wanna know I have your support when I meet with Kagame. He hates the French. He fought you three times. What role you will play in this is up to you, General. [truck rumbling] [water rushing] General. Dr. Kouchner wants to meet with you. That can be arranged. I'd like to see your forces as far apart as possible. I'm gonna insist they don't deploy in Kigali. Don't worry about that, General. The French won't be entering Kigali. Tell France Kigali can handle more body bags than Paris. Our rivers are awash with the blood of those we couldn't save. [ominous orchestral music] [speaking in foreign language] I couldn't bear it. Walking on that bridge, feeling it move up and down on their bodies. Until then I'd been walkin' around with a protective screen. I could put up that screen whenever I wanted. Whenever I had to. Suddenly it shattered. I didn't look at it for a long time. I made myself not look. I was afraid it would push me over the edge, make myself not see this crime. The crime of rape. So much of it. [somber orchestral music] The evidence was there. Even looking at a skeleton you could see it. Pain and humiliation. I see their faces all the time. Yesterday, rebel forces took Kigali, bringing an end to the civil war in Rwanda and an end as well to the Rwandan genocide, a humanitarian crisis that is being compared with the killing fields of Cambodia and the Holocaust itself. Aid is pouring in to Kigali and a number of international celebrities have pledged to raise funds to help the survivors of the genocide, an ordeal that lasted 100 days and left almost a million dead. - [Romeo] Can't stand silence now. Can't sleep in a bedroom. Can't be alone in a silent room. Silence is too loud. General, there is a problem with the goats. [dogs barking] [goats bleating] [gun firing] [dog yelps] [goats bleating] [wind howling] [somber piano music] Not good. I'm not good, Maurice. Uh... I need to be relieved of my command. [ominous orchestral music] [flies buzzing] [children chattering] [children laughing] [Prime Minister Agathe laughing] [singing in foreign language] [somber orchestral music] I failed. When you're guilty you can do penance, try to atone for your sins. When you fail, it's done. It's like an iron door slams shut. You can never open it again. [water sloshing] [somber music] [singing in foreign language] Everybody wants to forget Rwanda now. Can't let that happen. I haven't finished my mission. [hand slams against desk] You have to keep me alive. That's an order. [singing in foreign language] [dramatic orchestral music] [singing in foreign language] [ominous orchestral music]
