What's your name though, man. Quincy. Ain't never seen you before, you live around here. Me and my mom just moved here with my auntie Gwen. - Gwen Saulsberry? - Yeah. I can see a resemblance. I was wondering, do you guys have any photography classes? Nah, man. Unfortunately we don't. Everything around here is pretty much at a grassroots level, the community and the neighbors chip in to make sure we have bare necessities and everything that we need. But why you ask? You a photographer or something? A little bit. Okay. Okay. Walk with me. Well, this community center was built for us by us. So we try to do things for the kids, like afterschool programs, bake sales, sock donations, and help with schooling. I can get a summer job. Well, a job technically means you get paid to do that. Everybody around here volunteers their time and their resources. We all grew up in this neighborhood. Or either went to the high schools around the corner. Gotcha You know what man I tell you what, if you need help with schooling, something to eat or access to computers. All right, we got you. This is a safe haven. We all we got. Lemme go bruh. Hey, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What is going on out here? Hold on. Hold on. What is this? Weedie took my money. Mane, know I didn't. Yes you did. Weedie, what are you doing? You ain't even supposed to be up here. Let'em, let him go guys. Get y'all hands off of pimp. Mr. Joe, you gonna kick me out the program like that? Weedie I told you, once you got yourself together, you were welcome to come back here. You have not done your part. So you kicked yourself out the program. Mane, forget y'all, bunch of sissies up anyway. Look I'm sorry about that. You know him? No. Well, look, if you need anything, hit me up. All right. We all we got. Hey. Hey, if it isn't stay out all night. Don't start. So I guess it went better than expected. It's complicated. But I'll tell you about it one day. It's okay. You've been staring at those stars since we were little. It's peaceful. Do you remember that time when I fell out the tree and broke my arm and we tried to hide it from mama? Yes. And it was your night to wash the dishes and she was wondering why the hell I was helping you. Right? How could I forget? We had some good times though, did we? Charlene, I'm sorry. For what? For always being the nagging little sister, always up under you. I could have been more understanding, you know. I could have helped out more. But I was somewhere trying to be grown. Yes you were. But it's okay. With you and Quincy here, I feel like I got my family back. I feel like I get a second chance at life, and I just don't wanna mess it up. You won't.
