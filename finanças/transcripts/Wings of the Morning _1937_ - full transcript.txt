Gypsies! Greetings my friends... And welcome! Welcome? We're welcome anywhere! We're the royal Irish constabulary. Still... you're welcome. Where's that yoke going? To the village to trade among the people. Are you sure you're not going thieving amongst the people? Thieving? Oh, no... Trading. Here now... Did you get that horse for a basket? We're honourable... We are no thieves! He is ruler of all this place... He is a king! You'll have to move on... We have no king here, except her majesty, the queen. Gypsies were always welcome here before. But she has to speak for the king... And the rest of these thieves. I say, lads... This is not a bad-looking piece of goods. What's going on here, sergeant? I was only trying to rid you the sight of the vagabonds, my lord. Is that a privilege you reserve for yourself? Go on... Be off with you! And apologise! No... don't apologise... Just be off! May I express my people's gratitude, your lordship? I am marik, king of all romany. And this is my daughter, Marie. Great Caesar!...What a beauty! What a horse! Aha, my friend... A gem! A gem, polished and set! Is he for sale? You've given us your kindness... He was our biggest possession. Now, he's yours. Oh no! No, but if I charged you a starving-to-death permit of £1000... You forget my father is a king... he does not make idle promises. Well, if he has promised the romany the beautiful queen... he has certainly kept that promise. Surely there is something you wished... Something we can do for you. Yes, there is... That you continue to honour our estate with your presence. Forever? That's an idea....Why not? I make an open deed... This Glen shall be a haven for all gypsies, for the rest of time. A gypsy rest! You must watch! Otherwise she will be hurt. I don't want to watch. I only want to look at you. Bewitched! This is so wonderful! Must I go now? Well, it is rather a deadlock... I can't join the ladies... and you can't stay here with the men. Oh... it's too bad! Too bad... But we'll meet again. - Later? - Later. He knows how to pick 'em! I've half a mind to give you a race for her. Charming, isn't she? I should love you to tell my future. But unfortunately, I have no silver. Good lord... He couldn't possibly be serious about that gypsy girl! He's been with her almost constantly, for the last 3 weeks. Marie... Poor, poor dear! I saw what happened. These rude, hypocritical... What... tears? This won't do at all! I was so... So happy! Poor darling! How anybody with any heart at all could be cruel to you... i simply can't imagine. - I better go now. - You won't do anything of the sort. They are right... I don't belong here. You belong here for the rest of your beautiful life. Oh, no... That will be impossible. These people have got no imagination... No understanding... Are you afraid? Of me? Alright now? Blow! Hello, Valentine! What are you doing up at this time? I came to say goodnight to you, cousin. Well, cousin, you've already said goodnight to me about 50 times. I know it... Well... Goodnight! No... come here! Allow me to present you with the future lady clontarf. The future lady clontarf?! That's your cousin-to-be. Hello. Now may I stay up a while longer? No... now you're taking advantage of me. Well... goodnight! You know... You're beautiful! - Who me? - No... Her! I quite agree with you. Now, be off with you! Goodnight! Goodnight, Valentine. Well, this 'll have to do for the moment. Spanish. Very old. Been in the family for years. - Oh, no! - Why? Only gypsies are proud of gypsy blood. I'm not afraid... I love him. He's fine and strong. Together, we can make a world of our own. We shall be so happy! Do you realise what date it is? No, what is it? Our 5th anniversary. 5th anniversary? Do you forget? We were married 5 months ago, today. Oh, my dear... Every day is a blessed anniversary to me. Hello Harry. Hello, Ian. We'll go ahead... See you later. Am I joining the ladies? You ride too well, my dear... They're all jealous of you. I see. Please... go on with them... I'll go back. No, nonsense... If you go, I'll go too. No, please don't... They're your friends... Your life. I am parting you from them. What do we care about them? We're each other's lives. I know that, my dear... But I can't bear to see anyone humiliate you. Humiliate me? Come on... I will try and overtake them. That's better... We'll have a race for it. I've taken the inventory... We're perfectly willing to return to you... anything of intrinsic value... brought to you as dowry... according to the custom of your tribe. I'm sure you'll find it quite correct. There is everything you brought to clontarf castle. Yes... everything I brought here. Well, my business here seems to be finished. It has been very pleasant. I'm sorry, if I have a different point of view. With people from London... I will make an effort to keep what is mine. And you take it for granted that your inventory was complete... But you forgot to mention one small item... called "the heart." I will leave it here with my dowry. Fortunately for the clontarf name... there's no heir, as a result of this union. Must you go? Yes... i must. Why? Can I please go with you? I will return... Some time. Goodbye, Valentine. After Dublin... Do we go south? Far south... With speed. 1 generation... 2 generations... 3 generations. You have calved 3 generations... mixed breeding with blueblood can hurt much. It takes 4 generations to make it pure again. No flesh and blood of mine, will ever know the sadness of this place. Never! Just when his blood is pure again. A 4th generation... Yes. If I am spared... 4th generations. 3 generations have passed... Rebels have stolen my horses... Soldiers have taken my small fortune. My dream of a 4th generation here is shattered. Spain has been good to me... But this mad year of revolution... Of mob violence... has robbed me of much. Look at that. This marriage must not fail. You must take this letter immediately to Seville... to my great-granddaughter Maria. Stay by the girl... against all possible harm. But where will you go, Marie? Back to my home. I have promised a suitable dowry for this wedding. And you will go back as lady clontarf? Never. I shall go to destiny bay... to deep sea rest. Good morning Don frasco... But you must speak English here. Si, si, señora. How did "wings" run this morning? English... what did you say? We shall have ample time for building him solidly... once we have settled on a good Irish trainer. I am Spanish gypsy... I train him... he win the derby... If... If? If I like him... I no frasco... Good English? No letters for me, too? No words from Maria? Things are very bad in Spain... They are burning churches. Let us hope that Maria and Angelo are safe. Doña Maria, duchess of leyva. How do you do? You don't bring bad news? Maria is quite well... The letter will explain. Oh, I am so happy... She will come here? Where? Maria... i had to come... You shouldn't have come... No, no, no... I'm desperate. Tonight I stopped close here with friends... Early tomorrow morning, my man will call for you... and we sail for Portugal, by fishing-boat. If you go with him, speak for us both... Maria said so. You're under my care. Quick... go to the back way. Are those gypsies, paddy? Yes, sir Valentine. They landed in destiny bay, by boat. The gypsy camp must be somewhere near. We'll be after asking these 2 gentlemen, coming up at the road. Excuse me your honour... But could you be after telling me the handiest way to destiny bay? There are 2 ways... One's shorter than the other. You can go straight ahead here... Past the castle... Or take the right fork here to the cliff. Thank you sir... I think I'll take the castle road... It sounds the shorter. Do you mind the sign o' them gypsies... The next thing they'll be flittin' around in an aeroplane! Where's my Marie... Oh, Marie my dear! We had the most exciting time... Wonderful! Angelo! But my dear... Why these horrible clothes? I don't think they're horrible! It was the only way we could get across the frontier in safety. He threw all my clothes away... Beautiful clothes. After we escaped, I thought it wise to resume our travels as we were. And before I went I hid things in a cave♪♪♪... My face cream... My fine shoes... And a dozen pair of silk stockings. We can mend that, all in good time. But tell me... Don Diego... How is it with him? Oh boy!....He had a dreadful time... But he escaped to Portugal, with his mother. Poor creature! But I'm glad to have you back with me. You must be very tired, Maria. I'm not Maria, now... I'm dom Mario! You see... I change the last letter of my name... and... presto!...I'm a boy! - But you must dress. - No! I must send a telegram to Don Diego... telling him how I escaped... And I am safe with you. Benito will take it to the village. To send such a telegram... I will do it myself... alone. You understand?! Maria! [Spanish]. You mean to say... Maria has ridden away on "wings"? Take it easy, scruffy! I want to get the real lowdown on this gallop. Now hold your horses, till you get the signal. Don't be bobbing around like a monkey! Caramba! I will teach you a lesson! You will never run away with me again! Give me a stick! Hey, boy... Stop that! Shame on you! Drop that stick, do you hear? Mind your own business! Will you be running an eye over this fellow, son? What lame-brain would trust a fine horse like that to a little monkey like you? She's a beauty... Jog her a bit, Jimmy. I will have my horse! What a pair of eyes! Boy! Could I please have my horse?! You bad-tempered little shrimp! I'm not a shrimp! I'm Don Mario, Duke of leyva and montera... And Marquis de montera... A knight of the heulgra. He's gypsy stuff, sir. They have a way of play-acting, and calling each other grand names. Where on earth would such a little runt pick up a load of names like that to carry? I come from Spain... A country of magnificent gentlemen. A thousand pardons, Duke! I'm kerry gilfallen, and I'm from Canada. This is James Patrick aloysius brannigan... king of the horses. I will have my horse, please. Who owns this horse? I do! Likely! You're a cute little gypsy! Not much foundation there, for sitting on a horse, though. How do you like it? Pretty good nag... Is it for sale or trade? Oh... you like him? Don't you? No! After the way he treated me. I will never ride him again. Well, I see, well... Have a look around. Make your selection... Anything your little heart desires... We trade fairly even with gypsies. Anything I desire? Cross your heart. Hope to die! Help yourself, Duke. There is no one horse I would like. No one horse? What are you trying to pull? I said you could take your pick. The one you like... You are a good picker... That's a derby Colt. Try again. Very well... I will take those four. Those four?! And I will have the big horse with brown eyes. What do you think this is... A remnant sale? Do you want your one? And I will have that one and that one and that one! Find out if gypsy files pedigree... and find out if they have any papers on the horse. Right you are, sir. I hope the backbone of that horse doesn't take any skin off your highness! I'll take care of that! I guess I made a sharp trade... But a bargain's a bargain. He looks a fine horse, sir. But after all... He is a pig-in-the-poke, sir. Have a carrot, son? Think I'll give him a run around. Isn't that one of our horses that he's riding? Well, it's certainly not mine. He's got fine action. Yes... sure... his legs all touching the ground! Where is "wings"? You should be astonished at what I bring you... I beguiled, and charmed silly goose in a real acquisition! Six horses for one! Be quiet! Answer questions! What has happened?! Oh, your bad horse... He threw me off... So I sent him away... You traded?! When did one of your gypsies win 6 for 1?! Never!...thank the lord! Take those 6 goats out of my sight! And to you, I looked for a 4th generation! I think this critter's a real slick horse! He's a beauty, eh?! My, he's fine! Where on earth did you get this fellow from? I traded 6 old hacks to a gypsy lad for him. They're not worth the value of his left nostril. Times have changed, me boy, if the gypsies are losing their cunning. They say the angels smile, when the gypsy gets rooked. They're laughing out loud, right now. Come on. Do you know this man who has swindled you? I do... He's a beast! He spanked me! - Spanked you? - And kicked me! Right here. Naturally... you wouldn't understand... But this horse means everything to me... And to you. I am sorry I make a mistake... I shall send Angelo after the rogue. Please... do let me go instead. I promise to bring back the horse. I know just how to handle that young gentleman. Yes? I hope you're not being fickle to your derby Colt. Not I... I can train two horses as well as one... Blindfolded and left-handed. I know you want to be another ira carn. I wouldn't mind. I sent Jimmy along to fetch back the pedigree... In case the gypsies keep papers. That's a good idea. Speaking of the devil... Jimmy's here, himself. I had the devil's own luck, sir... They savagely attacked me from the rear, and all sides... A thousand of 'em! What about the papers? I didn't get the opportunity... I was blasted away in a cyclone of confusion... like the widow Malone's Monday washing! They want their horse back! I wouldn't be inviting trouble with these people, kerry. A bargain's a bargain! Well, I'll go down and see 'em in the morning. They love burning down stables, just for the smell of the smoke. Well, maybe I'll go down and see 'em this evening. - My bath ready? - Yes, always ready, sir. Don't be using the front door... Go out the back! I won't... It's bad luck... I always go out the way I came in. I've see you thrown out of public houses... and not always the way you came in! Is anyone there? Sure, darlin'! I'm here! What's happening? Is there anything wrong? Oh, there's nothing wrong. Our nephew... Something about a horse. Not kerry's derby horse? No, it's a complete stranger. A gypsy horse. Oh, I love the dear silver... That shines in her hair... And the brow that’s all furrowed... And wrinkled with care. I kiss the dear fingers so toil-worn for me... Oh, god bless her and keep her... Mother machree. The ringing of bells and the changing of coats... I'll be in me grave before it's half dug. I wish to see Don kerry. Gypsy! Around the back and mind the dog... and don't be letting in the fog! If you please... Will you announce the Duke of leyva to Don kerry. What kind of talk is that? Never mind, paddy... I'll take care of the lad. In spite of his high-falutin' name... He's a... Gypsy. I don't bother about that... I've got a soft spot in my heart for them. I expect you'll be lockin' up the silver. I understand your trading has not been endorsed at headquarters, eh? I beg your pardon, sir... May I discuss my affair with Don kerry? You'll find the man at the top of the stairs... Second door. Thank you, sir! Yeah? Oh, it's you! Have a chair... I'll be through in a jiffy. Can you hand me a towel off that rack? Come on now... Be a sport... Hand me a towel like a gentleman. Never heard of a bashful gypsy, before. Are their some ladies here? My aunt Jennifer, why? If you can use soft language, close the door. Go on. I am a gentleman... Which I hoped you would be. A gentleman who welches on his bargain. What is "Welch"? And cry like a baby... "I want my horse back". Your horses! They are 6 goats. All of them would not make one good one. You wouldn't dare stand over there and say that to my face. I don't like your face. I don't like your whining attitude. I gave you 6 horses of unknown quantity, but... I took a sporting chance myself. Then... let us forget the trade... and pretend we never met each other. You're cute one, Duke! I'll dress and we'll get down to business. Will you ring that bell over there for my man? - I'll go and call him. - Never mind! Stay here. Did the rascal throw you downstairs? He wants his man. You're not hurt, I hope. No... I'm alright! I'll rind for paddy, right now. Scruffy, if you're a real good dog, I'll let you go out and bite a gypsy. Here... try one of these... They're my own brand... Specially imported... You do smoke? Yes! Let me Pierce it for you. Good? Not bad! So kerry's been playing trickery on you... The bad lad! Quantity for quality, I understand. I must have that horse back. It doesn't belong to me. Kerry know that? No. I could not explain. He was naked. Naked? What's that got to do with it? It was difficult... He was in the bath... And then getting out... I suppose you'll want a towel... You'll find the eau de Cologne on the dresser. Yes, I've had this miniature, ever since I was a little lad... and it treasure it very much. She was a gypsy. A gypsy?! We were very fond of her. Come on, Duke! Make it snappy... And you can have your horse back. Adios... and thank you so much... Goodbye... and I hope everything will be alright. The kid's crazy... I should have known better. Who's there? Jimmy, sir. What's up? That horse... The gypsy one, sir... He broke out. Went through the gate... To the Meadow. Give me that lantern... Come on Duke. Do you see what you have done? You keep quiet... I'm the one who should grumble. I'd go back right now... If I knew the way. I wish you would. You can make that wish double. I don't want a murder on my soul. We might come right to the edge of this cliff... and fall right in the sea. We're right near the sea now. Stay right behind me. Let go of my hand... If you're scared, hang on to my coat. This ought to teach me a lesson... Getting mixed up with a little squirt like you. It's all your fault, señor! Did you hear anything? Only your jabbering. Here he is. Come here, boy. Now I can take him home... Yes? You always answer your own questions... Yes? Yes! We'd better take it inside to keep the poor fellow steady. Come on, boy. Here, Duke... Hold it. He's a handsome brute. If you help me on, I will ride him home... They will be worried. Ride?...i saw a sample of your riding. You must have been brought up on a Spanish donkey... or a merry-go-round or something. Please... you must not make fun with Spain! Besides... this old shack is on the edge of a cliff. You couldn't find your way back in this fog, with a military escort. Yes, but... You frightened me out of my skin... i thought it was a ghost! A goat? I said a ghost! There's not a sign of kerry and the gypsy lad... in a fog that's thicker than glue. I knew we'd endure a curse, with a gypsy across our threshold. I reckon it's the same bad luck that took lord clontarf off... years and years ago. He died a natural death! You don't believe in ghosts. I'll tell you one! Did I ever tell you the story of the 2 ghosts... who were going to haunt the castle? They were walking along a lonely road... and one of them started to fall back and shake all over. "Come on!" Said the first ghost. "What the devil are you afraid of?" You don't believe in ghosts! He'll be alright for the night. For the night?! We can't go back in this fog... and there's no telling when it will let up. Whatever you do, don't move the horse while I'm asleep. I'll bed myself down up here. Well? It's dark. I'm cold. Sure. Are you going to sleep here? Certainly. I can't sleep in the hay. Well, you might have to crawl back to camp, on your hands and knees. What's the matter? I saw a mouse. The idea of a tough kid like you, afraid of a little Mickey mouse. And you a gypsy! Settle down, will ya! Now what? I don't know. Oh, shut up, then! Oh, you want to play... Listen, Duke... I'm getting fed up! You try that again... And I'll sock you in the jaw! You were snoring... Like a pig. Good morning, Duke. Good morning. - Did you sleep all night? - Not with you. We searched from the castle to the cliff... Along the shore. And no word... No sign of them? Un Caballero es aquí, Maria. A gentleman? Good day, my good woman... I'm wondering if by any chance my nephew, kerry gilfallen, is here. He left our place last night with a gypsy lad... What is doing with the "gypsy lad"? If any harm comes to that lad... I'm as much in the dark as you are. All I know is they left our place last night, in search of a horse. He got him by cheating. I beg your pardon. We don't cheat gypsies. Well, if you hear anything, I'm up at clontarf castle. My name's Valentine mcfallen. Valentine?! I am Marie! Dear lady clontarf! The years have been good to you! Remember, I always promised I would come back. Why are you stopping here? A nice quiet swim... Put us in fine fettle for a hearty breakfast. Come on... Peel off your duds! What's the matter, Duke? I'm cold. You're going to wait till I go in, then run away with the horse, eh? No you're not... You're going swimming... Come on! No... please don't... Make me my clothes! Please... no! Little baby! Gosh, I'm sorry... I didn't know. After the disaster in Spain... i buried my pride... All my emotions. I came here in desperation... with that brilliant Colt, "wings". I entered him for the derby, the day he was born. Tell me, is there anything I can do for you? I am worried about that child. Ah, then... You can save yourself the trouble. He's a smart lad, and well able to take care of himself. That "lad" as you call him... He is my own great-granddaughter. Maria. You tell me he's a girl!? So that accounts for some quaint goings-on, at the castle last night. Let us talk of practical things. First, I need a trainer... That's so fortunate... This kerry lad of mine... Sure there's no finer judge or trainer of horses, in the whole of Ireland! Good! I have to go abroad on financial business... But, this girl... She does not belong to gypsies. I plan to put her at a convent school nearby... where you might keep a watchful eye. And where could I do that better than in me own house?! No... i didn't mean... I know you didn't... But I do! The wife and I'll be proud to welcome her for your own dear sakes. Listen, don't say anything to anybody about this... or I'll be in disgrace for the rest of my life. Disgrace!? What about me?! Stealing off my things... Sleeping in the hay... Well, you needn't go into details! Oh, give me my horse! You gave me such a fright! I know... But it was all his fault! Kerry, this lady is... "Madame mairik." But you won't like him... I don't! That's right, me darlin'... You put the rascal in his place. [Spanish] I'll take the Colt for training, on one condition. Keep this shrimp away from me. The shrimp? Yes! You are a snoring jackass! Another thing... I might show a slight preference for my own derby entry "destiny bay". But you wouldn't do that? Don't worry... No finer person ever lived, than kerry. That's what he thinks... He's a cheat! I know what it is... You are both starving. I'm famished. Will you stop, and take gypsy pot-luck with us? We could talk further. What do you think of that, kerry? O.k. I'm not hungry... Goodbye. Curious... maid I am now, to the gypsy boy. You mean the gypsy girl! I suppose so. First she's a boy... Then it's vice-versa... A terror for me, as the case may be. How long is she staying? Sir Valentine himself should know... turning mr kerry out of his old rooms. My dear... If you could only see these beautiful clothes! My dear... I see a great deal of the beauty of life. Sometimes I think, just because I'm blind... there's more perfume in the garden. Or in the Heather, when the wind blows over it. Tell me kerry... Is there any knowing just how good the gypsy horse is? He's a fine animal, a bit wild and green... but no comparison to "destiny bay". I've warned the stable lads... Not a word to outsiders... in case he does shape as a derby prospect. But wait... Do you know that gypsy woman means to lay £2,000 and more in the winter book! She'd have more horse sense than pounds, if she waits till spring. It's not a hack, after all. Uncle, can I put a fair question to you? Sure you can! Is it about the girl? Does she have to stay here? I honestly don't know meself if the girl wouldn't mind... Because, god bless her, she's a dear little soul. She's a spoiled brat, if I ever saw one. You haven't seen as much of her as I have. I haven't seen... No, I Grant you that! It's going to be awkward for me around here... She's a nuisance... You can tell her so from me. You don't mean that, though. Holy mackerel! My friend, "the Duke"! Look... will you wait right here, just a minute?! Don't go away. Look... everything I said about her... I take it all back. I didn't know. Well, let me feel your pulse. She's different... She's... Gosh, she's beautiful! And I was trying to make a man of you! I was trying to do the same thing for you. When I think of the things I've done... Yes? If you are just a man, you will forget! You should never dress as a boy... Even for a revolution. Shall we go in, to dinner? It's from the Duke, Don Diego. This is a wishing well. Famous shrine for hundreds and hundreds of years. Shall we have a go at it? Alright! You have to take your shoes and stockings off. You want to start that again? No, you have to stand in the water in your bare feet... then make a wish. Get out of there, scruffy... unless you're on the level in making a wish. Both feet! It has to be a wish you really want to come true. Of course, you can't tell the wish to anybody... Because if you did, then it wouldn't come true. - Are you ready? - Yes. Now close your eyes and be perfectly still. What did you wish? But you said... if we tell our wish to anyone, it will not come true. I know. What I meant was... I hoped we both wished the same wish. Do you understand? Give me your foot. You don't know it, but you're coming to a party that I'm giving for you. You also own your own castile, yes? I'll have a surprise for you that any girl in Ireland 'll be proud of. I will think about it. You'll come. Getting harder to handle than "wings"... now that you've changed into these fancy blankets. Hey... look! Scruffy got his wish! - Hello kerry. - Hello. Now comes your surprise. A moment please, everybody. We have a grand surprise for you. Friends, I have the honour to announce... That we have with us thus evening... The distinguished Irish artist and world celebrity... A beloved neighbour who is here to honour our own guest and friend... The duchess of leyva... John mccormack! This is the duchess of leyva, John... John mccormack. Will you sing for us? I will, if the duchess pleases. - Hello, John. - Hello, kerry what will you sing, John? I think I'll sing... "Believe me if all these endearing young charms" This is a lovely surprise! Believe me, if all those endearing young charms... Which I gaze on so fondly today... Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in mine arms... Like fairy gifts fading away... Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art... Let thy loveliness fade as it will... And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart... Would entwine itself verdantly still. Oh the heart of ours truly, love, never forgets... But as truly loves on to the close... As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets... The same look which she turned when he Rose. "Killarney", John... Sing "killarney", will you! "Danny boy", John..."Danny boy"! Will you sing "come back to Erin"? How about the old favourite "killarney"? That do? What the devil are you doing here? I just wanted to see John mccormack sing. "See him sing?" Sure, I've never heard him, except on a cracked record. Are you sure it was the record that was cracked. By killarney's lakes and fells... Em'rald isles and winding bays... Mountain paths and woodland dells... Mem'ry ever fondly strays. Bounteous nature loves all lands... Beauty wonders ev'rywhere... Footprints leaves on many strands... But her home is surely there! Angels fold their wings and rest... In that Eden of the west... Beauty's home killarney... Heaven's reflex killarney. Castle lough and glena bay... Mountains tore and eagle's nest... Still at mucross you must pray... Though the monks are now at rest. Angels wonder not that man... I love you! There would fain prolong life's span... You must not say that. Why not? Beauty's home killarney... Heaven's reflex killarney. There's Maria... She's looking ever so sweet. I wish I could see her. Hello, dear! It's all so fine... So perfect! And who could imagine dear Marie would not come tonight. Oh, you needn't worry... She was here. Marie... here?! I'll explain to you later on. Poor soul, she had an unhappy experience in this very room. Yes, I know. But, sure, it's your sweet self, that's made us forget all that tonight! Marie and I stand another surprise for you. For me? What is it? I'll tell you by and by. - Oh, please! - No... No! It may happen at any moment now. Sir Valentine mcfallen is expecting me. Sir Valentine... I am. And it's delighted I am to have the honour to welcome you. Who was that? The Duke de montrael del campo. If there are any Dukes about... I'll let them in! Back to the kitchen! My nephew, kerry gilfallen... The Duke de montrael. Come on... Don't let's stand here. I'm sure you're looking forward to making their acquaintance. Had you only been here a moment earlier... you'd have heard the most joyous voice in the world. Just a moment and I'll bring Maria along. Have you just come from Spain? No... from London. My mother, she is not well... I have taken her there. In the spring I get married in London, also. Fine... congratulations! - She did not tell you? - Who? My bride... The duchess of leyva. Don Diego! Where have you come from? Maria! A big surprise, yes? I get your telegram... I come very quick, eh? I want you to meet some of the other guests... Come on. One morning early as I walked forth... By the margin of lough leane... The sunshine dressed the trees in green... And the summer bloomed again... I left the town and wandered on... Through fields all green and gay... And whom should I meet but a Colleen soft... At the dawning of the day. I'm sorry, kerry. Ever try to roll a cigarette with wet hands? I only smoke cigars. Do you understand, kerry? I guess I do. It is very difficult for me to explain. I have tried to tell you, but... I did not know how. Is it all arranged? Then that's that! Goodnight, kerry. Goodnight. Scruffy, you probably don't know it... You're going to Canada with me... After the derby. That's the way I feel, too. F.j... I'd like to talk to him. Fine... right away. Fine. Right. Thanks a lot....Goodbye. Hot diggety dog! The race is in the bag! Guess who's riding for me! Don't tell me... Don't tell me you've got donoghue! Isn't that luck! Begorrah... they can't lose! Oh, I wish I could see donoghue ride! You'll get the next best thing... You'll hear him win. I have bad news, kerry. Marie is very ill. Where is she? At a gypsy camp... A different town. We'll get her to a hospital. It's impossible... She won't go... She just smiles... And says it will soon pass. Do they have a doctor for her? Yes, but she fainted, when she heard Don frasco could not ride. What's this? Don frasco's been refused by the jockey club. Not properly register-endorsed. I must pack. Poor Marie... She staked everything on the race. And kerry. He's done a brave and fine thing, training "wings". Because he'll know what'll happen if this gypsy horse wins. Maria 'll not only get her dowry... but she'll marry Don Diego as well. He played a very high trump card, engaging donoghue to ride. Ah, Steve donoghue... It's delighted I am to have the honour of meeting you. This is my wife, lady mcfallen... How do you do. You're not as big as I am. Come along... Come along. I expect you men are going to talk horse, so I'll leave you. I'll come with you darling. I'll send kerry right along. How are you, Steve. I can't tell you how happy I am to have you ride for me. Well, this is a great break for me... riding a real live thoroughbred, and one trained by you. The thing is Steve... You can't lose on "wings". "Wings"? He's the best horse of the 2... You're the best jockey in the world... There's only one answer to that. What about "destiny bay"? Well, there's been a last-minute reshuffling... and my own boy, O'Hara, knows "destiny bay" backwards. He'll give you the race of your life. Well, here we are for another year on epsom downs for derby day. The greatest race in the world. The most colourful spectacle in all the calendar of sport. Right across the lovely green river of the derby course... i can see the crowds of ordinary people like you and me. Over a million of them here today... Mostly without a hope of seeing the race... but just intend to jostle around, and be one of the derby crowd. Dukes and batsmen, barons and barmaids... Old beans, has-beans, actors, actresses, husbands, maids, mistresses... all sorts of people. Over there in the grandstand, opposite the judges box... I can see half the names in "Burke's peerage" and "who's who". The other half I can't see... Because they've drunk a glass of milk. Coming on now is the well-known whisky-distiller and racing man, lord porthaven, with lady porthaven. Just behind him is lord haycock, with the beautiful Mrs... Well it's a lovely day, and I'm sure we're going to have a grand race. Now just for a change from listening to me... I'm going to hand over the microphone to epsom downs... Listen! That'll be enough of that! Away in the background is a little camp of gypsy caravans. No derby is complete, without the people of romany. Dark-skinned faces... flashing teeth and gay caravans clothed with all the colours of the rainbow. Telling your fortune and wishing you luck. I must stay for your sake. For both of you. You will, my dear! You know, there is an ancient rule of the derby... the owner of the winning horse must be alive... otherwise the horse is disqualified. How is she? How do you do. Nothing, señor. I was hoping you and Don Diego would join us in our box. Valentine and Jennifer are expecting you. I must stay here. May I go in? What's all this? They told me yesterday, you'd be out on the fence today. You are an angel, kerry. If I don't win, my one prayer is that you do. You're a real sport, Marie! I must see this race, then... It may be my last. Hey, that doesn't sound a bit like you. Take me up onto the roof... i shall be as well up there, as here. I've always lived in the open. If I die... You're right... Up you go. Now the moment, for the sound of the great race, is approaching. The world-famous course before us is a seething mass. People are beginning to drift back from the paddock onto the course... as 22 thoroughbreds come out for the parade. "nocturne" at 6 to 4... Kerry gilfallen's "destiny bay" at 10 to 1. But what's the no.3 .. "Wings of the morning".... with Steve donoghue up... gone out to 20... It's sensational the way the price of "wings" has altered in the last few hours. Both "wings" and "destiny bay" are looking fit as fiddles! Splendid! Hello, kerry my boy... How's Marie? Not too good. Rumour's got out... Now she's affected the odds on "wings". Coming out for the parade now... all the starters are in the peak of condition. Prince monolulu, the prince of tetsu, is watching them go. I've got a horse... I've got a horse! Is there any moment more thrilling than this?! The tense expectation of the crowd as those perfectly-trained thoroughbreds are led towards the starting gate. There's a very old rule of the derby... that the owner must be living at the time of the race... otherwise the horse is disqualified. This is why the odds on "wings" have lengthened. There is a rumor floating around, that "wings" ' owner, a gypsy woman... is lying seriously ill. It's getting near the time for the start now... In a few moments, they'll be off... I'm going to hand over to my friend Bob miles, the racing expert... who's going to describe the great derby for you. "Wings" is acting up a bit. Hey... he is... He is! He's too full of pep, I guess. "Bay" is as cool as a cucumber. He's taking it easy. They're coming up again. Come on up there, "wings"... Come on up! "cordon" leads by a length and a half... ""nocturne" is trying to fill the gap... "destiny bay" is third... Donoghue's moved up... For his favorite place on the rail... Nothing much in it yet... Nocturne's still in front... "Destiny bay" is second, now. Coming to the top of the hill... donoghue moving towards his favorite rail position... Definitely picking up on "nocturne". "Nocturne" leading... "destiny bay" second. "Wings"! "Wings"! "Wings"! He's clear... He's got himself out... but he's too badly placed. Moving up towards the front horses now... Still "nocturne" leading... "Destiny bay" closer... Coming to the top of the hill... now catching any second now... "Nocturne"..."destiny"...here they come. "Nocturne" well in front of "destiny bay"... Donoghue sitting on her, on popular "wings of the morning"... "Destiny bay" moving up towards "nocturne". "Nocturne" is ceding... "Destiny bay" is coming away... "Wings of the morning" getting a better run... Coming through... but locked in behind 3 horses... Still an awful lot to do... Still looks... Now "destiny bay" is right in front. Caught up by "wings of the morning" a bit... "Velvet" is losing its ground... "Destiny bay" has beaten "nocturne"... Here comes "wings of the morning". Getting a fair run, too... It's flying! "Destiny bay" in front... "Wings of the morning" is gaining... What a race! As good as I've ever seen. "Wings of the morning"..."Destiny bay"... "Wings of the morning" "wings of the morning" keeps with "destiny bay"... No. 3 "wings of the morning" wins... "Wings of the morning" wins! Second, "destiny bay" by a length... "Nocturne " third. Kerry my boy... Congratulations! I can see lord derby over there. "Wings of the morning", with Steve donoghue up... is now being led into the unsaddling enclosure. Unfortunately, the owner's illness has prevented her from sharing in the triumph... by leading in the horse with the blue ribbon... Well, there it is... I've won, but I've lost. Just one of those things! I'm going down to see the boys. What is it? I don't understand a thing. He mean's Don Diego's won... and he's lost Maria. The winning numbers are now being run up on the board. But wait a minute... There's the objection flag. The race for the derby stakes is not yet over. The objection flag, darlin'. What?! That means the "wings" may lose. It's bad for poor Marie. And kerry will have won on "destiny bay". Yes. What about Maria and Don Diego? That's just what I'm wondering about. It's bad enough to lose the race... But on top of that there's about £60,000. £60,000... after you've had it right in your lap. Then, maybe we do not marry. You mean... I love you, Maria... But it would not be fair to you... You know I have lost everything in Spain. I have my family... I'm helpless without money. There is the... "Arrangement." The custom... Our dowry. Please go. Millions of people are still waiting for the result. The fate of thousands of pounds, rests in the hands of the stewards. The verdict of the race... hangs on whether the owner of "wings of the morning" is alive at this moment... Or not. Angelo... Call all the gypsies together... Something extraordinary is happening down at the course... A procession of gypsies... It looks like some sort of demonstration. On top of the huge caravan is the old gypsy owner of "wings of the morning". Blimey! She's alive! It's a most fantastic sight... and the result of the derby hangs on this... Evidently, she is alive. The gypsy procession is now passing the members enclosure... We should soon hear the stewards' decision. There goes the objection flag... The gypsy woman owner is alive... Or is she alive? Your guess is as good as mine. Clever people, these gypsies. Well, it looks like I've lost this time, for sure. Marie and Don Diego won a double. I'm leaving, I'll send a car back from London. I understand, kerry... But never mind... We'll talk it over bye and bye. Not me... I'm going back to Canada, right away. You've got to come back to Ireland first... There's business to attend to. Besides there's Jennifer and meself. You're coming with me, both of you... The trip will do you good. What a day... What a derby! Every derby is a national triumph... But here is one that will never be forgotten. It is strange... Kerry to be made unhappy... Just on a day like this. Well, I wouldn't worry about that. Hello, Maria! Where's kerry? All this excitement is too much for him... He's gone back to London. My dear... What on earth has happened? I'll tell you bye and bye. Congratulations, my dear! He's not going to Canada? - No. - You are sure? He's got to come back to Ireland, first. I see. What are you looking so down about? Been a lot of talk about a "dog's life". You don't know how lucky you are. Incidentally... you'll have to drop that British accent... when we get back to Canada. Duke! What's the big idea?! It's my surprise... You like it? I love it! I don't understand... I want to marry you. Subtitles by fatplank for kg
