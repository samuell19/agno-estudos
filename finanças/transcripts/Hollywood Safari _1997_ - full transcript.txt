Honey, what is it? It's.. [gasp] Mountain lion! [screaming] Yes sir. I can't run a city like this. No, I know. The City Council... -Yes, sir. I know that the City Council has... Tourists going to Riverside... Yes, Mayor Karl, what we're doing... ...we're losing a whopping 40% in city revenues... Yes, sir. I know that 40% is a big drop. We have a problem, we need it solved. Well, sir, we're doing our best. I don't want your best. Anyone can say we're doing our best. Yes, sir. Got to do better than your best, sheriff. We'll do a little better than that. I want that job done. Now go do what you're paid to do. Yes, sir. It's mayor pain in my rump. Looks like the tourism is down 40% since that kid was attacked last week. Says if this keeps up, We're gonna lose a million dollars this year. And tourism for picnicking and camping. I told you, sheriff. We're going to get some of the boys together. Then we can go up there and put an end to this. The problem is not trying to get rid of it, Deputy. The problem is finding it. While we're waiting for the next attack - and there will be another attack. We could have 20 guys up there in the hills looking for it. Rogers, with their luck, they just shoot themselves. I'm calling in some dogs from Lencaster. That's a day's drive. Humour me on this deputy, I know that the election is still a month away, but let's just pretend that I'm the sheriff until then. [phone rings] Sheriff's Station, this is Officer McClane. What? Hold on. When? Uh huh. Where? No, no, don't do anything just to stay right there. We'll be right there. Excuse me, sir. A bunch of picnickers just spotted a lion right near Dewer's Creek. Okay, let's roll. This is the third attack. Call forestry and fish and game. Tell them where the sighting was. Right away, sir. [indistinct chatter] [tires screeching] [shouting] [gunshots] [explosion] [gunshots] [explosion] [explosion] [screaming] [applause] Cut! Good take! All right, everybody. Take five. That's five, people. Hi. Greg. You're right on time. That's us. Greg! All right, let's strike those C stands. We're back in three, everyone. What? Take a look. Uh oh. Uh oh! Why do you say Uh oh? Out big cat is missing. Missing? Missing? What do you mean? Like gone? Not here? somewhere else? I'll call Troy. No, wait. We can handle this ourselves. Are you crazy? Look, I can fix it. How? Just give me a minute to think. We can backtrack. We can't just leave the animals here. Okay? You stay. I'll go. I can't handle this. I've only been here six months. We are in deep trouble. Woman: We were all scared. Just kept moving. Man: Yeah, it was Big. We tried to scare the thing away. You know, that lion or cougar or whatever you wanna call it. But it just kept on coming. That's when we called you. How long ago was that, sir? That was about a half hour ago, I guess. Huh? Okay. Sheriff. Call HQ. Give me the county chopper. Notify the highway patrol. -Yes, sir. Should we wait for the sheriff? No, we shouldn't. This thing doesn't have any range. Give me something with power. What the hell do you think you're doing? Don't scare her. Just be quiet. You use the tranquilizer gun. In case you've forgotten that cat attacked an innocent boy. I came here to kill it. In case you forgot this is protected land. Besides, that might not be the right cat. Just stand aside, Sheriff. I'm ordering you to put down that weapon, Deputy. Can't do that. That boy was the son of one of my friends. Look, just because it was the son of one of your beer guzzling poker buddies you don't have the right to go off half cocked. Put down that weapon. I'm sorry, Sheriff. Are you disobeying a direct order? We'll do it your way. If that's the lion we're looking for, you have my permission to exterminate it. You're can dance on its grave. In time. In time. [gun fires] [cat growls] Rogers, come over here, please. Look, I think we've got this thing with the cat wrapped up now, so I'm going off for a day or two. I gotta keep an appointment in Marion for the campaign. Would you call the mayor in the Chamber of Commerce? Let him know everything's okay now? For re-election? Yeah. Something like that. Look, Rogers. I know, we don't always see eye to eye on things, but you're a good deputy. I'm leaving you in charge. Keep a watch out for me. Keep things on an even keel. I'm counting on you. I'll do my best. Do a little bit better than that. Good job, Deputy. Janey. Rogers. Copy, Deputy. Janey, call Teresa Towers down the radio station and Earl at the paper and tell them we got the cat. You're kidding. You got the cat? That's right. I'm not lying, Janie. I got him myself. Janey. Call Oxnard Television Station and have them get a reporter down here on the double. I want to end this as the sheriff, Jenny. Yes, sir. We had this thing ordered for weeks. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's it? I'm sorry. Every second we don't shoot is costing us money. Give me that. Can you dial this phone? Can you? Well call Troy. Now. Get me your boss. What are you waiting for? A written invitation? Whoa! What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, say that again. I said Kensho is missing. She jumped out of the trailer. When? About an hour ago. An hour ago? Well, What have you been doing all this time? I could - Troy. We had a deal. I call for a lion, I expect a lion, I pay for a lion, I expect a lion. You lied to me. Think you're ever gonna work in this town again? Your career is over. I want that cat. We got that cat. Like I said, this is a beast that attacked that boy at the campground last week. That was Deputy Rogers who captured this mountain lion who's been terrorizing folks near Dewer's Creek. I think everybody knows once a cat like this tastes human blood, they'll come back for more. Now, the law says we should put this animal to sleep. I think everybody in this county is gonna back me on this. Thanks. I gotta go. The lion is sedated for now and will remain that way for 10 to 12 hours. In the meantime, all we can do is wait to see what its fate will - Josh! Go get your father! ...They want immediate extermination. That's Kensho! Dad. Dad! Kensho was on TV. Lost her right out of the back of the truck... They're gonna kill her. What's going on? If that sheriff touches a hair on her head - What are you talking about? On TV. Kensho has been captured, they're holding her at the sheriff's station. They're gonna kill her, Troy. Okay, Sheriff Station. Let's go. Can I come? Absolutely. [barking] You stay here. Just in case. What!? Alright. [barking] Josh: Dad, stop the car. Come on in, buddy. Good boy. [barking] Sheriff! Stay. Can I help you? That's my cat you got locked up. Just one second. I think this is front page stuff. Tell him to hurry up and get - What's your problem, lady? That's my cat you've got locked up. It's your cat? And who the hell are you? Firstly, deputy, she's my wife. And secondly, she's the owner of the cat. I'm the law here, and I'd like her to start showing some respect for the law quickly. You're the deputy. Where's your boss? I am the boss. Yeah - [dog barks] Please, son, take the dog outside. No animals in here. Come on, buddy. Sorry, boy. You got to stay out here. [barking] Release that animal right now or I'll - -Or you'll what? Wait a second. Wait a second. Deputy, we have reason to believe that the cat that you have in your cell right now is one of ours. Now, we were transporting animals to a movie set, when somehow she got out. That cat attacked a little boy. That little boy is in the hospital right now. [whimpers] Sheriff: I don't wanna have to go into that with you. Do you want me to? What are you doing? Dad: What are you talking about? Get behind. Look, if an animal attacks a human, we have to kill it. That's the law. Deputy. She's a professionally trained animal. She's tame. She's a performer. She's tame. You call this tame? Sorry. Look, can't we please just take a look at the animal? What for? So we can prove it's ours. Well, let's say that the two of you decide that that's not the cat. I've got 200 people that say it is. Who are you gonna believe? But can't we just have five minutes with the cat? All right, fine. I'll let you have your five, and then I'm gonna put you both in jail and slap you with public endangerment. Come on, buddy. Let's go. Mom. Mom? Mom, I'm leaving. Yeah, yeah. Okay. -Look, I've got two officers coming here from fish and game. They've got a shot that will put your cat to sleep painlessly and quickly. You're welcome to stay here. There's a better way to deal with this. Yeah, there is. Okay. I got a plan, Muddy. Yeah, I want you to smell this. Come here, boy. Yeah, smell it. That's it boy, good boy. All right. [barking] [phone rings] Hello. Prep a tranquilizer gun. Make that two. Oh, and bring some bait, okay? We're going hunting. What for? I'm gonna track a lion. I don't know, Josh, because Mom and Dad told me to stay here. You're always doing what Mom says. Now is not the time to listen to Mom. Come on, act your age. -I am. I'm only 14. Peter. They're gonna kill Kensho if we don't get moving. All right. Okay. So I want you to meet me at the dead tree. Bye. Plato, not now. Hey, give me that dart. Give it to me, Plato. Come on. We can't mess around. Come on, hand it over. Thanks. Oh man. Caught that cat. Suppose you heard about it. That's why we're here. It's terrible what it did to that boy. Lots of people around here appreciate you getting rid of that thing. Is that right? Yes, sir. Three attacks like that. Pretty near closing down this whole town. Well, we'll make sure it doesn't get the chance to do that kind of thing again. Good luck. Yeah, thanks. So, what do you think? Hello? Can I help you? Yes. I'm Mr Williams. Mr. Stevens. Where the animal control officers. We're here to take care of that bad cat. What's this? What took you guys so long? You're deputy Rogers? Yeah. Bring your stuff back here. Mind if I set up shop right here? No! [shouting] I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. Looks like we came just in time for the fireworks. You're not gonna interfere, are you? Come on, Jane. Can we get on with it? I want to get home. Where's that cat? We got it back here. Hey! Ma'am. Hold it. You're under arrest. For what? For impeding an officer. What? You want me to add resisting arrest? [barking] Hey, Peter. What took you so long? I've been waiting here for half an hour. What a ride. What are you doing on my bike? Mine had a flat. Did you bring everything? Yep. Come on. We don't have much time. Let's go. How we gonna find it, Josh? Well, I say we go back to where the kid was first attacked at the campground. I'm sure we'll pick up a scent there. How are we gonna do that? Scent's only two days old. Yeah, but what if Muddy can't pick up a scent? I don't know. Got to try, though. Sure to find something. Probably right. -Got to. [barking] Excuse me, sir. Sir? Sir, I think maybe we should wait. Maybe until we get the tests. Let me have your badge. I said give me your badge. Come on. You're fired, McQueen. Excuse me? -Go home. Look for another job. You're through. I don't wanna be fired. McQueen. I want cops here. Cops that obey orders, that don't talk back. That know how to keep their mouth closed. I'm sorry. I won't - [barking] Josh: We're right behind you, boy. Peter: Hey, slow down, Muddy. Wait up, boy. I think he's got something. You're gonna have to get off. It's way too rugged. We're gonna have to walk the rest on foot. Alright. [barking] Let's go. How much farther? Looking at Muddy I'd say not far at all. I got a bad feeling about this. Let's get Dad. Josh: What? Peter: I don't know. I just feel kind of weird about this. Josh: Okay, just one half hour. Okay? Then we'll go back. All right? -All right. [barking] We've been here before. Muddy! [barking] We're just going around in circles. What do you mean? You see, Muddy can't pinpoint the mountain lion because the mountain lion has been all over these woods, particularly around here. Understand? Yeah, great. So what do we do? What do we do? I say we go back before it gets too dark. Come on. [barking] Let's go, Muddy. [barks] Come on, boy. Let's go. Hey, Josh. What? Look. What is this? It's a trap. Trap? It's a trap for what? Poachers. Look. This... Primitive. It's illegal. It's okay. It's okay. So what should we do? Tell Mom and Dad when we get back. Shouldn't we just tell the rangers - Shh! Listen. What is it? Listen. You hear that? No. Come on. Let's go find out. Be careful, Josh. Whoa. What are we gonna do with it once we get it out? It looks so sick and stuff. Bring it to mom. She's got to know what to do with it. Hurry! What if the poachers come? That's why we gotta hurry, man. Come on. [barking] Quiet, Muddy. This thing won't open. [barking] It's stuck. [snarling] [lion snarls] Josh! Josh! Josh! Look! The mountain lion! [snarling] [barking] Hold it. I'll get the tranquilizer gun. You just keep running. [snarling] [gun fires] Jump, Peter. Ahhh! -Whoa! Ow. Josh: Buddy, go high. Go! Get out of here. What? Ow, it hurts. Is it broke? Let me see. Come on. It's not broke. Here. [barking] [whimpers] We're dead. No we're not. What are we gonna do? What's gonna happen to us? Listen, how long is it gonna take to do that job in there? I've got some reporters coming down. They're gonna want some photos. What are you doing? Going. You have a job to do. Not here we don't. What about the cat? What about it? You were supposed to kill it. Are you a clown? Are you calling me a clown? No, sir. I'm asking you a question. Are you a clown? Because this isn't a police station. This is a circus, and we don't want no part of it. That nut you just threw in jail broke my bottle. Don't you have more? Yeah, sure. Back at the office. And since it's near quitting time, we're about to wrap things up. So we'll see you on Monday. Ciao. Deputy, secure that door. Yes, sir. I have to have that cat dead. I have to have that cat dead today. I have three sets of campgrounds that are empty because of that damn cat. The mayor is breathing down my neck, and the City Council is gonna take this badge in a New York minute if I don't give them a cat's dead body today. Like my partner said, Deputy Rogers, we didn't bring the whole artillery. We just brought the one bottle. Didn't you come prepared? For World War Three? I suggest that you get the situation under control and then you give us a call on Monday. No, no. I could get you back today. I'll get you back here today. That's a two hour ride there in a two hour ride back. There is no goddam- Deputy, I want you to secure a squad car that will take a certain gentleman back to his office so that he can get the equipment he needs to finish his job here. And if that gentleman gives you any trouble, you'll have to throw his bum in jail. Yeah. I want you to take my car and my deputy, who's gonna drive faster than the wind. Like he's never seen any speed signs before in his life. Bells and whistles going. He can get you back here before the sun sets so that you could be home before happy hour. Are we clear now on the procedure, Mr Animal Control Officer? Anything you say, Deputy Sheriff. Good. I had a feeling you see it my way. It's alright. -You okay? How long do you think she'll stay? She knows we're trapped, Peter. She's just gonna wait. Hey, the tranquilizer gun. Where's the tranquilizer gun, Josh? I dropped it. Great. You gotta do something, Josh. Like what? What are we gonna dio? I don't know, you got us into this stupid mess. It's not my fault we found traps. No one knows where we are. We could've told mom and dad or something. Mom and Dad? Yeah, like they'd really let us come, right? Yeah. Exactly. Just calm down, okay? We'll get out of this. Don't worry about it. [snarling] [barking] Wait a second. You hear that? What? -Shh. [barking] It's Muddy. [barking] [snarling] Muddy! -Muddy! He's dead. I know it. [hissing and snarling] [barking] Muddy! Muddy! -Here boy! [barking] [cheering] Way to go, boy! Muddy, down here! Good boy, Muddy. -Good boy, Muddy. [barking] Hey, man. A still works. You got the darts? Right here. Yes! Good boy Muddy! No, don't come down, Muddy. Come on, go get mom and dad! Yeah, go get Troy! Go get him. Hurry, Muddy. Hurry. Officer: You can use my phone if you like. Dad: Oh, thanks anyway. I called everybody I know already. Nothing. My lawyer's fishing. Officer: We do a lot of that around here. Hey, Mudd, what are you doing here? Oh, hey! [barking] What is it, Mudd? I think he's happy to see you, Troy. No, it's something else. [barking] Hey, hey, stop, stop! You could use a hand. You bet. [barking] Okay, let's try it again, Peter. Okay, let's go. Got it. Hold on. What's wrong? Did you hurt yourself? What's wrong? They're going to kill Kensho, aren't they? I remember when we first brought you home. You were so tiny. I don't know how you got yourself stuck up in that tree at the compound. It was really high for you. You were so afraid. But Josh heard you crying. When nobody else did. You know, he wasn't even one for climbing trees, but climb he did. Must have been up in that branch with you for more than half an hour before any of us knew where you were, he was so young. I don't think he even remembers that. Hey, what did you guys talk about up there? Because, you know, Josh has never been the same since then. Neither of you were ever the same. [barking] Josh. Josh! What is it? My kid's bike. I got one kid at home, and one kid is always into things like this, Josh! [screaming] Think you can hit it? No. You can. No, way Josh, I ain't doing it. You're the better shot, Pete. No, I'm not. I can't do it, Josh. You got to do it. Do it. Right. Come on. Come on. Stay still. [gun fires] Got him. Yes! You did it, man. [barking] Muddy! Muddy, down here, boy! Dad! -Peter! Hold on. Quickly, get that branch. Hang on. Josh: Hold on, Peter. Careful. Don't slip. Reach up. Got it. All right. Good. That's it. Got it. All right. Somebody better tell me what's going on. Well, Muddy helped us track the mountain lion. We tried to get out, but we found a lion cub in a trap up there. Then she showed. Then what we did, we ran. We ended up in there. What about you? What's your story? He's just a bad influence on me. Troy. Give me your truck keys. Think you can handle it? Yeah, No problem. I'll bring the truck up around the back. There's an old service road that runs near here. So who's the marksman? Peter. Nice shooting, Tex. Peter: Trap's over here. Josh: Yeah, right in those bushes, dad. Over there. Well, hello. Looks like we got competition. Looks like we have competition. Let's go welcome our guests. You guys rapel down. I'll take the van. I'll meet you there. Alright. This must be her cub. That could explain her nasty disposition. She also has a trap wound on her leg. And I thought you were going to stay in the house. Peter: I was going to but he called me and he told me - It's my fault. Well, don't worry. There'll be plenty enough blame to go around. Poachers, Dad? For sure. Looks to be about eight or 10 weeks old. Can we keep it? I don't think so. Move. You don't have to be so rough. Take it easy. Let the kids go. You can have my wallet. Hey, Nestor hear that? He says we can have his wallet. I heard that. Dad? Oh, Dad, isn't that cute? It's a family operation. What are we talking about? Moving in. Is that it? Sorry. This place is taken. It's ours. Okay, listen. Sure. We'll just be on our way. We're out of here. We're not poachers. What are you talking about, kid? Poachers? You gotta be kidding. You guys ain't poachers and not cops. What are you, a bunch of nice guys? You know, I think I will help myself to that wallet, sir. Troy Johnson. Well, Mr Troy Johnson. What is it that you do? Animal trainer. Listen, we have a mountain lion too, all right? Sheriff just took it, that's all. That's why we have to bring this one back with us. We gotta. To prove that ours didn't attack anyone. You gotta believe us. Well, Mr Troy, is that the story? Yeah, that's it. Okay. Dad! As soon as we get out of Dodge we'll send something back for you. What if a bear comes? I guess you better learn how to pray. Oh, Uh oh. Guess you're just dumb enough to think you could get away with this, huh? Yeah, you can see who's pretty dumb there, Mr Troy. Bye, guys. Get the cat. Josh: You can't just leave us like this. Pete: Yeah, this ain't fair! Josh: Hey, you can't leave! Nestor. Throw him in the back. Come on, Eddie, get in. Sure about those guys back there? Yes. Stupid environmentalists. Kiss my butt. You said we're gonna make a call for them. What? I mean, that's what you said. Hurry this seep up. Sorry, boys. This could take a while. Don't pull so hard, Josh. Ow. [whimpering] Hey, boy, come here. Uh, how about a little help here? Pull the rope. -Come here. Right down there. Good boy. Pull it. Come on, pull harder! Come on, Don't stop. That's it. Pull it. Yeah, good boy, Muddy. That's it. Alright. Hold on, Dad. Pete: Where the heck have you been? Officer: What happened? What happened here? Troy: It's a long story. Let me drive. I knew we had poachers out there. I knew it. They have to take the canyon, right? It's the only way in. It's the only way out. Let's hope my timing is right. Whoa, Dad! Floor it, Troy! You got it. Jack. You ain't gonna believe this. What? Look behind us. Jeezo pete! Come on. Step on it. I am. I thought you said they would - Never mind what I said. Just get us out of here. I'm working on it. Come on. Come on. Get us out of here. Move! Hold on. Ow! Ahh! Sorry. Hey, guys, what about me? Creeps! Man! My gun's in the van. You're alright. You're not going anywhere. I want you to stay here and take care of that cub. Peter: The cub's all right. Josh: The mother lion's still sedated. She's fine, too. [panting] Josh: Hey, come on. Let's check him out. Poacher: Come on, I'm trapped! He's hurt. -Yeah. Can't just leave him like that, Josh. Poacher: Come on. I'm almost passing out from the pain. You promise to behave? Poacher: Sure. Yeah, sure. I don't know, Josh should we believe him? No. Do you? Better get him out anyway, though. Come on, give me your hand. Let's go. Yah! Come on. ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ Poacher: Ow! Watch it! Pete: It ain't my fault you got a big butt! I thought you said you were gonna behave in the car. I lied. That ain't fair - Peter, shh. Quiet.
