I might change my hair style. What? Are you serious? You know Hige will beat the hell out of you. I can't be bothered to do my hair every morning. Yeah, you're right there. I can't be bothered to do my hair every morning. Yeah, you're right there. Hige kicks me all the time. I hate him. Hey! What? Isn't this the Kenji from Chiku High?! Okay! You want to fight? Oops, we're doomed. We're not doomed. Nothing's happened yet. There's a rumor that Chiku High's Kenji is a master of the Spaghetti Fist. The Spaghetti Fist? I never heard of it. I don't know the details, but I heard it's the strongest Kenpo on earth. The strongest? That's rubbish, complete bullshit But it's true that Kenji crushed our guys last week. We don't know if it was him. Run! It's the Spaghetti Fist!!! ON-GAKU: Our Sound KEEP OUT Hey, Kenji. Hey. Boxing Boy!! Hitoshi Marutake High wants a fight with us. Shall we beat them up? Yeah. When? Any time. Okay, how about now? The Three Musketeers. Where're you off to? Hey, Aya. We're off to Marutake High to fight with Oba. Raiding Marutake, just the three of you? I can go solo, but it's more fun to do it together. What confidence. Actually, I'm not worried. I'll tell you about it tomorrow. See you then. Ota, where is Marutake? What? I don't know. - Asakura? - No idea. I'll ask them. Hello, Aya. How did it go? - What? - Marutake High? We couldn't find it, so we didn't go. You didn't know the place? Marutake is quite notorious around here. Really? I didn't know. Yes, so you can go today. I guess so. Kenji, how about today? Oh, I wasn't listening. Are we raiding Marutake today? Oh, that. I can't be bothered. Not today. No? What a bore! - See you. - Yeah See you. Thief! Someone, catch that thief! Bro, hold this for me! I'll get you! Mr. Policeman, over here - Yes, be a good lad. - Ouch! So, you caught him? - Yes. - Okay You are twisting my arm again! Hey you! No need to press me down! Could you come with us then? - Why me? - Ya, you! We need to know the details. I just chased and caught him. Please come to the station. I can't. I have a gig. Where is it held? You sing? No, I play the bass. Wow, amazing. You have to come. It won't take time. Absolutely no time to visit the police. Say this old lady got him? Hey! An old lady? Mischievous Squeeze HELLO, I AM SQUEEZE! I LOVE TO SQUEEZE! YAY! LET ME SQUEEZE SOMEONE. HEY! LET ME SQUEEZE YOU. Stop it! WHY NOT? IT'S ONLY A SQUUEZE COME ON. Stop it! JUST FOR A TINY BIT. COME ON. Stop! I'll call the police! NO, I FORBID IT. THE POLICE WILL ENFORCE WITH MAXIMUM SQUEEZE, YOU FOOL. YOU NEED A PROPER SQUEEZE, MORON! Hello! Police? KEEP OUT Ota, Asakura... What's up, Kenji? Let's start a band. Are you serious, Kenji? Of course. - But I can't play. - Same here. That's the whole point. What is? Just follow me anyway. MUSIC ROOM Oh yeah, it's all here. MUSIC ROOM Oh yeah, it's all here. I guess a band needs a guitar, a bass guitar, and drums. A guitar and a bass. I have that at home. Which one? The red one. So, we take the bass. How about the drums? Whatever you can carry. Where do you want this? Anywhere. Hey? This is a bass, too, Kenji. What's a bass, anyway? A bass plays low notes. Low notes? Whatever, let's just do it. Where does this go? A hole at the right end. At the right? Got it. Did you hear that? Yeah, low notes. Wow! Awesome! All right, let's do it. Ready! Go! What just happened felt so good. - Yeah - Me, too. All right! Let's play on! MARUTAKE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL Hey boss, MARUTAKE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL MARUTAKE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL Matsui and others want to leave the gang. Shall I correct them? Don't be hasty. Why are they suddenly saying such a thing? It seems... they lost their wits after being crushed by Chiku High's Kenji. Not Kenji again. Someone stopped coming to school last week. That was also Kenji, right? Yes, after being chased by Kenji on a bicycle, he's gone neurotic and withdrawn. Kenji is screwing with us. We need to beat him up and make him understand. Let's call him and beat the shit out of him! Aya's also from Chiku High, right? Shall I ask Aya to give a message? No, I'll talk with Aya. Kenji. We practice after school? Of course. What's the thing at the head of a bass guitar? Yeah, I was wondering about that, too. Turning the knob makes the sound... go "Boing!" maybe. Oh, I get it. Hey! The Three Musketeers. What now Aya? We're having a serious discussion. Plotting as usual, huh? Marutake's Oba wants a one-on-one with you. Fight with Oba. We're now crazy about music. I have no time for that idiot. Music? I heard a strange sound from your home. Was that the music? Yes, I must study the "Boing!" technique. What's a "Boing!" technique? It's top secret. - Let's go. - Yeah You will address us as musicians from now on. Musician? Yes, with admiration. Whatever, but you've got to play for me first. Okay, we're ready. Go ahead. Ready, go. That's it. How was it, Aya? It's good and manly. I like it. Really! - Is there a vocal? - No. A band name? I forgot about that. Hey, you two decide the band name. A band name. We hadn't decided yet. Chuck...Maybe not. "Kobujutsu?" That's it. Oh, is that it? How can you be so sloppy? KOBUJUTSU BAND NAME WWWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWWW Asakura, what is Kobujutsu? I don't really know. My uncle is into the martial art. Kobujutsu... I've heard it somewhere. Break a leg, you guys and Kobujutsu. What about? What's the time? It's 18:52. I see. It seems Kenji's chickened out. Well, boss? Let's slice him to bits. Don't be hasty. I must really hurt him. Wait for the right moment. Who the hell are you? Oh, so many part-timers today. One, two, three... Stop counting! - Not for night shift? - Kidding! - No? - Don't play with us! Just get lost if you want to keep your glasses. Is that you, Oba? Hello, boss! It's Oba! A shift at a fish factory? Ah, Matsutake. Boss, how're you? My junior, Oba. Despite his skin head, he's useful. I see, they're your juniors. Okay, you get on the bus, too. Did you watch it on TV? I did. Awesome! Kenji! Ota! What now? There's a band called Kobijutsu Really? Kobijutsu! What shall we do? Nothing. Nothing? I'll get them to change their band name. Before that, I'd like to hear their music. Let's go Kobijutsu, Kobijutsu. Hello, Kobijutsu. What's that? Maybe a new business? Those three are dangerous. We must be careful. It can't be anything good. They're no good. Not here, let's move on. I'm hungry. Let's go to an eatery. It's 11:30. It won't be open yet. Shit! Shit! Shit! Morita! A delinquent trio in Class B is looking for Kobijutsu! No! Are you sure? Now now, take a deep breath. Run! That's the only way to survive! Everyone, this will be our last performance as Kobijutsu. Ahhh Morita, how many fingers do I get to keep? None, I expect. Kobijutsu. Oh, the door's locked. Kobijutsu. I think we found Kobijutsu. Asakura, remove the door. Hello. - What can I do for you? - Hi! We're Kobujutsu. What? H...how do you do? We're Kobijutsu. What can we do for you? We'd like to listen to your performance. FOLK SONG CLUB May we start? Yes, please start. Your silhouette was so wonderful Picking up shiny shells by the surf The rhythm of the steps of your supple legs Collaborates with my heartbeat Taking a local line to your town I watched the sunset like a TV drama After many sleepless nights A pale light in the darkness Rides the south wind to your star I watched the aurora like a TV drama Following a path I cannot return A pale light sheds in the darkness Um, it's like this. Did you like it? Wonderful. T...thank you! It's our turn next, Kobujutsu. Let us begin. Please. - Let's go. - Yeah. Ready! Go!! How was it? It was fantastic! How? I felt the primitive impulse of rock music! Wow, amazing. I know! Why not play in the rock festival with us this August? Sure, we will. Wow, great! Is it like a party? Yes! It's a small scale, but the first rock festival in Japan. - Okay, great. - Thank you! - It's getting serious all right. - Yeah. A gig in the festival? Wow! - Sort of. - Maybe you need a song. A song? - I agree with you. - Yeah I'm not singing. Nor am I. Not me. - Aya... -What? You sing! What? Why me? It's your band! You brought it up. Aya is a good idea. Hey! I agree. It's decided. No, you may not decide! Can't you sing? Well, that's sort of not entirely true. Aya, let's go to a mall. Sorry, I've got things to do. - Okay. - Maybe next time. Bye. I'm home. FOLK SONG CLUB Here, the rock festival program. FOLK SONG CLUB Here, the rock festival program. - Our name's on it. - Where? - The 5th one. - Oh my. Shit, I'm getting really nervous. Same here. I suggest to record it and listen to it. It helps you to check your performance. I see. All right! Are we ready? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's go then. Ka pow. Actually... I think it's amazing. I agree. We'll do fine on the stage. Nothing to worry. I can't wait to play. We should try it on TV. Ota. Asakura. What, Kenji? I'm bored with the band. Kenji has lost his interest? It's the usual stuff. Was it after listening to the tape? No, the tape was perfect. I'll deal with it somehow. I see. I'm slightly... quite worried. These're flyers for the festival. Hand them out at many places. Ok Let me know when you run out. Leave it to us. Do you want an ashtray? No, I don't smoke. Morita, you really love music. I'm only good at music. Without music, I'm nobody. Despite my look, I'm hopeless in my study. Well, I'm sort of like you. I'll lend my CDs to you. Take as many as you like! I don't know any of it. It's a lot of CDs. How many are there? I've lost accurate count, so maybe around 30,000? 30,000! Wow! That's crazy. How about this one? Look at that! What crazy faces! Kenji's lost interest? As usual. You let him get away with it? Yeah, Kenji started the band. So bloody selfish! Nothing we can do to change his mind. A crocodile was released after he got bored. I'll talk with Kenji. Good luck. What now Aya? Is it true that you quit the band? None of your business. You let me down. You were just an idiot. Ota. Hey Asakura. Was Kenji at home? No, he wasn't. I guess it's just two of us. I guess so. I forgot a stool. Shall we find one? I'll do it standing up. Okay, let's go. - Yeah. - Ready, go! Come to the festival. Please come to the festival. Come to the festival. Thanks very much. Oh no, Morita?! - Aya, let's walk back. - Sorry, next time. Not again. I was waiting for you. SAKAMOTO TOWN ROCK FESTIVAL SAKAMOTO TOWN ROCK FESTIVAL SAKAMOTO TOWN ROCK FESTIVAL SAKAMOTO TOWN ROCK FESTIVAL Did we put up enough posters? Yeah, we did. Let's go to a comic cafe. Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day. It sure is. Will Kenji come? He'll turn up. I noticed he was... keeping rhythm with his ass. I'm glad we started a band. Me, too. - Hear that? - Where from? It's from the sea. From Chonmage Island. That's true. Oh, it stopped. MARUTAKE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL Boss! Terrible news! MARUTAKE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL MARUTAKE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL Look! Kenji is appearing in the rock festival today! Is he now? I've been ignored by that piece of shit. I will... take him down. Hello there! Let's start the Sakamoto Town Rock Festival! - What a big crowd. - Yeah. - I'm getting nervous. - Me, too How're you two doing? - Aya! - Eek, what now? Kenji is not here yet. Don't worry, he'll be here. Hey, Kenji! Wait! I'm talking to you, Kenji! Wait! Kenji. Oh, it's that idiot Oba. Shut up, moron! Shitty Oba. You bastard! Don't be hasty. Kenji... If you want to be in the gig, choose one. First, you get beaten up by me or you destroy the bass... Wait! I am still talking to you! Hey! Calm yourself down, Kenji! A recorder? So fast! Take the recorder from him! Wait, you asshole. Wait! Stop running, idiot. Wait. Love, that's love That's love. Love, that's love Love, that's love Love Groovy, man. That was Public Shibata. Now, let me introduce Kobijutsu Kenji's not coming, is he? Is that you, Morita? Yes. I'm off to the stage! We're Kobijutsu. Your silhouette looked so wonderful I am banging the odds tonight, thinking of you The side of your hair looked so wonderful I am flat broke in the morning, coming back to your town Bar bar bucking the odds tonight, Having siesta Bang, bang, bar, bar Woooooooo Kucci! Bar bar bucking the odds tonight, having siesta Bang, bang, bar, bar Woooooooo Kucci! It's all right. Don't stop! He stopped moving. We want more! Come on! T...that was Kobijutsu. Thank you very much. Morita... I'm sorry... What a terrible thing to do before the debut of Kobujutsu. Nonsense! That was so cool! Thank you. I wish you two the best of luck. Yeah... So it'll be just two of us. I guess so. Can I run away? I want to but I can't move. Next is the Butt Spankings. Where's that moron? Let's welcome the Kobujutsu. Hello, Kobujutsu, looking for Kobujutsu. There they are. You're up. - Let's go. - Yeah. Hello, Kobujutsu. You're wanted on the stage. Kenji, you fool! - Are you ready? - Yeah. Let's go. Yeah. Ready! Go! A recorder? The first piece done. We thought you'd never come. The bastard. Get him off the stage. No wait, don't be hasty. Wait until the audience gets excited. It would disappoint the crowd, and Kenji and the band would be wasted. Ota, Asakura, are you ready? - Okay. - Yeah. Alright - Here we go! - Yeah! Ready! Go! Hey. Hey. I didn't know you sing. Of course I do. How's the band? The band broke up. What! Broke up? Yeah. Aya. What? Are you still seeing Marutake's Oba? Oba and I just went to the same school. Aya. Will you... go to Disneyland with me? That's creepy. Oops. - Hey Asakura. - Hey - A comic cafe? - Yeah. Skipping, huh? Any good news? Not really. - What was that? - I wonder. Speaking of the band reunion. Let's ask today. He'll agree. Is that so? Ota, Asakura. Hey, Morita.
