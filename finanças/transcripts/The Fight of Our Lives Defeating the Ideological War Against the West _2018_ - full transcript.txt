(slow dramatic music) - Civilizations, empires, great powers can fall apart very fast. Collapse can come suddenly, like a thief in the night. And we should be very wary of assuming that our civilization, the civilization of the early 21st century West, will oblige us by declining gradually. I think a lot of people who look at the United States and debate its decline, even the pessimistic ones, assume that this will take decades and perhaps it will be a problem for their grandchildren. When people talk about Europe's problems, there's a tendency to say, oh the demographic difficulties of Europe and the slowdown in European growth mean that over time it will recede in its importance relative to the past. But that may be completely wrong. We may in fact find that Europe falls apart quite fast, not in a Europe in the sense of the European Union, but I mean Europe in the cultural sense, as the heir of centuries of what used to be called Christendom. The mass migrations that we see into Europe at this time, and the social consequences of trying, and I suspect not succeeding, in integrating millions of people from non-European cultures, particularly from the Islamic world, raises the prospects of a major crisis of European culture. And the civilization that we've grown accustomed to thinking of as Europe may not be around by the end of the century. Or it may have changed so much that it's unrecognizable. (dramatic music) - I think there are two threats facing the West and they are linked. There is a threat from within and the threat from without. And the threat from without is made much more threatening by the threat from within. The threat from within comes from people who want to undermine and destroy the basis of Western Civilization, the basis of Western society. - Europe was ravaged after a period of ultra-nationalism and conflicts, the period between World War I and World War II, and World War II itself with the Shoah and the complete devastation of Europe economically, socially, culturally. Adorno argued that Europe actually died in Auschwitz, that this was the marking of an end of an era and the marking of complete devastation. The infrastructure was destroyed, perhaps the morality, the teachings were really called into question, and philosophers and thinkers of the time looked at the horrible consequences of extreme nationalism and binary notions of identity of being and otherness. - This continues in philosophy with existentialism and what eventually will be known as postmodern theory. These are the ways that you can see that sense of doubt, of failure, of collapse inside Western confidence and optimism. So I think the wars really are the beginning of this, and it continues. It continues on to the 50s, and then into the 60s you have another generation, a new revolutionary generation that is reacting against everything their parents represent. - The Baby Boomer generation of whom I am one were extremely influenced in the 1960s by the writing in particular of Gramsci, the political philosopher. And Gramsci's whole thing was effectively to say if you're gonna wait for the workers to rise up and seize the levers of economic and political control, you wait forever. A much more effective and much, much smarter way of undermining and taking over Western society is to attack the citadels of the culture, the media, the universities, education, the law, the church, all the institutions of the culture. You infiltrate them and you undermine them from within and you turn the mind of the West against itself. - After the turn of the century, the dominant theory in social sciences and humanities is postcolonial theory. Postcolonial theory, to put it very simply, says that all the evils in the world were caused by Western imperialism. Before Western imperialism, everything was lovely in the world. Everybody got along, there were no clear groups, there was no war, there was no evil. This is a kind of morphing of Lenin's theory of imperialism. He argued that imperialist capitalist societies would export class conflict to other societies so that the people that were exploited were the people in the other societies and everybody in the home society, the elites and the working class, would benefit from that exploitation. - Less than 30 years after the collapse of communism in the West, the former communists and the Marxists-Leninists who defended the virtues of the Soviet Union and its worldview have managed to rebrand themselves as champions of human rights and are able to somehow take the lead in educating new generations, and in shaping our public debate, and dictating what is acceptable and what is not acceptable anymore in the public domain. - As part of the post-modern project, that's a fancy word for saying that there is no such thing as absolute truth or reality, it's socially conditioned on who has power and who doesn't. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. In that relativist world in the last 30 years in the United States, it's manifested itself by two or three powerful ideologies in a variety of ways. One is Utopian passivism, you believe that the innate nature of man is good and that if you were to assume that everybody is good and that they don't react to power or deterrence or the threat of force, but they react instead as we saw with Barack Obama's apology tour, his Cairo Speech, then they will reciprocate in kind. That's a tenet of this post-modern world that says deterrence, balance of power, alliances, that was all nineteenth century. We've got a new paradigm, and it's contrary to human nature unfortunately. It's no more accurate than if you opened your backyard up and said everybody can come and camp out, and they're gonna cleanup, and they're gonna be very nice and share, it would be a mess. The other tenet of this post-modern experiment was, I think we would call it multiculturalism as opposed to multi-racialism. That is multi-racialism was the United States' ideal that we'd have all different ethnic backgrounds and races, but combined E Pluribus Unum under one Western paradigm. But with hyphenation, or accented names, or identity politics the idea became well this common culture is not good because it was not perfect, it had slavery, it had sexism, it had racism, and it conflates the idea that the sins of mankind that everybody has throughout the world are solely and particularly only the sins of the West in general, the United States in particular. So we can't be good because we're not perfect, and therefore we're not going to stand for the national anthem or we're going to suggest in our history classes that we're guilty of genocide. (gentle music) - Now cultural relativism developed from Franz Boas, the founder of North American anthropology and his students, Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead. Now Ruth Benedict published a book in '37 or '38 called Patterns of Culture, it was very popular, a very popular book. And in it she really developed explicitly the idea of cultural relativism by which she meant that if you are going to try and understand somebody's life you have to suspend your own ideas, you have to suspend your own values, suspend your own judgments. And so it was a research technique to allow you to do your job better in understanding other societies. Now what's happened toward the end of the 20th century was that that idea of cultural relativism has been expanded. Cultural relativism as a field methodology has become ethical and moral relativism that disallows judgments of actions by people in other cultures. Now if you can't judge another culture you pretty much have to say well then all cultures are equally good and equally valid. - Cultures that cut off people's hands if they are robbers, or cultures that oppress their women, or that perform female genital mutilation, or that honor kill women for so-called cultural atrocities are definitely not the same as cultures that respect women, where there is gender equality, where there is a respect for people that follow every path. There are cultures in which homophobia is rampant. So I would not say that all cultures are equal. (dramatic music) - We should be concerned about the university not just because of the importance of scholarship and research, but also because it's the training ground for our future leaders. - When I teach students, I look out of the classroom and I don't just see a 150 faces, I see a future president of the United States, a future Chief Justice, a future editor of the New York Times, the Washington Post, a future senior partner of Goldman Sachs, the future leaders. And they are being miseducated in ways that completely undercut Western values. No tolerance for dissenting ideas. They know The Truth with capital T and capital T. They require safe spaces for their ideas but not for the ideas of others. They require trigger warnings if they might be offended by an idea that's suggested that's different from their own values. The kind of light fog of fascism that seems to be descending on many universities poses a tremendous danger for the future of Western values because it threatens to miseducate the future leaders who have to promote the values we cherish. - Now broadly speaking, there should be no safe space against any kind of speech at a university because the university is the site of, or should be the site of ideas in direct combat with other ideas. - The idea, the concept of higher education, of academia, both research and teaching is criticism, both knowledge and criticism. Well if everything that's critical, however it's presented is defined as micro-aggression as some sort of form of discrimination. Even if only half of the discussions that take place in sociology departments and political science departments, or in humanities and elsewhere, has to be wrapped in this trigger-warning framework, we've lost the concept of a university, and we've lost the concept of research and open criticism. We're back to the days of Galileo, of the Pope wanting to burn Galileo, because he had ideas that were offensive to the powers that be. Now that doesn't mean that discrimination, anti-Semitism, racism in its various forms should be allowed to thrive, but there has to be enough space for critical dialogue. If you say certain topics are completely off the table, you cannot talk about comparative religion, and comparing the aggressive tendencies in different religions over history, you know we can't talk about that 'cause that might be seen offensive to some groups. Well, then that whole part of the human experience is completely removed from the university. What you're gonna be left with is maybe some physics, not even a lot of biology because it gets to DNA and that can be seen as somehow leading to trigger warning problems for some people. Math, you can do a lot of math there, but you're not gonna have discussions about history, and human society, and politics in any serious matter. - Let's be honest, there is an increasing growth of programs on college campuses and universities. Many of them are in response to political agitation. They are not necessarily there for pedagogical reasons. And so we have various studies programs that are out there, which are designed not to teach students how to think, but to teach students what to think. - On universities, there is almost a kind of an intellectual masochism, a sense that we should not be proud of the values that we stand for, that we even need to engage in a kind of a ritual self-flagellation, discarding the names of the founders of our institutions and disregarding the values that our universities and that our country were founded upon. - Even the university that the third president of the United States of America, the man who wrote our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, who founded University of Virginia, the students there do not want Jefferson quoted because he once owned slaves. - So we're gonna go back through history, and we're gonna pick winners and losers according to our own particular passing value system. And now that passing value system is race, class and gender. And maybe it won't be tomorrow or the next day, but we're gonna rename things, we're gonna Trotskyize art, we're gonna do whatever it takes to make sure that all the people in the past fit our idea of a ethical, race, class and gender person. - A lot of our academic elite sees itself as in adversarial posture to the received institutions of America and of Western society. And so, when Yale let it be known that it had accepted a large grant to create a Western civilization program, a lot of these folks, and they're active and vocal, said not here if we can help it. And eventually, they were successful. It is indeed not there. - There is too little in our universities being taught about what the admirable aspects of the Western Tradition are. So, too few students graduate from our universities having read classics of the liberal tradition, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, The Federalist Papers, Immanuel Kant. It's fairly easy now to graduate from even excellent universities, without having read people who made the best arguments for human rights, for liberal democracy, for political pluralism. - We are in a way more dependent upon education and virtue in our citizenry than any other kind of regime, because in our regimes, liberal and democratic regimes, the citizens have huge responsibility. We vote for the leaders, we make those decisions. - Frequently it's the universities where rather negative notions begin to become hegemonic, and are picked up by students and then broadcast out to the society. If you look at the history of the German university in this respect, which across the 19th century became the great source of Western research and teaching, the German universities failed in the late 20s and 30s. They became hotbeds for either communism on the one hand, or Nazism on the other. (speaking in foreign language) - For the last 15 perhaps even 20 years Western universities have been receiving funds with strings attached from Islamic countries, but also China. For example, Georgetown University and Harvard have each received 20 million dollars from Prince Alwaleed of Saudi Arabia, this was in 2005. And there were a series of scandals in England when they found that the London School of Economics was receiving money from Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, and they also received at least 9 million dollars from the United Arab Emirates. The University of Durham signed a memorandum with the Iranian government. They had to agree to certain conditions, and of course you're not allowed to teach Islam in any way, which the people who are funding these departments disagree with. So you even have the case of scholars like Daniel Easterman who was teaching at the University of Newcastle, He was thrown out for teaching Islam in a way that the Saudis did not approve of. - In some schools, at San Francisco State University, for example, you will not get a good grade in a Middle Eastern Studies department if you have any type of pro-Zionist point of view, or so-called pro-Israel point of view. Students are actually discouraged from signing up for classes, and it has been the case, for example, at San Francisco State University, where professors have gone on trips to the Middle East, have met with representatives of designated terrorist groups and are bringing back the knowledge that they have learned from these terrorist groups into the Middle Eastern studies departments, and it has radicalized youth on U.S. campuses. We have an example where students are posting again on Facebook at SFSU, pictures of themselves holding knives saying that they want to kill Israelis and to intimidate Jews. You have pro-Israel or Jewish students who can't even walk around campus with a Jewish star. - University administrators have their own right and obligation of free speech. Professors, deans, presidents, board members, not only have a right but an obligation to condemn hate speech when it occurs on their campus, while defending the right of the hater to express that speech outside of the classroom. - In practice, freedom of speech has been under increasing threat in Britain, in a number of ways. First of all, hate speech has come in in a big way. There is certain sorts of speech which largely consists of the giving of offense to groups, which are self-designated victim groups. They are entitled to say we are offended by this discourse, and so we wish to suppress it. And the state basically comes in and says, yeah, we think that's correct and it should be deemed hate speech, and we should give it no oxygen whatsoever. We should give it no platform. We will deal with it either by the law or by informal means to eradicate it. This has been taken to some extremes in Britain, obviously in America too on-campus, in which the giving of offense through hate speech has created the demand for safe space on university campuses. - University administrators giving students Play-Doh and coloring books in order to deal with their trauma because their candidate lost. I mean, it's an infantilism, but a very dangerous one. We can smile, we can laugh, but this is what's happened to American universities, which were the pride of our society 20, 30 years ago? - The students are the end product of the problem. The problem is with the faculty. The problem is that the University faculty in Britain, as in America, has swallowed wholesale the lies and libels of theorists, and professors, and analysts, like Edward Said, and many others of that ilk so that the student body is not only taught propaganda, which is all based on the idea that the West and Israel are evil, but they get penalized if in their university essays or dissertations they try and write the truth about the Middle East. - In 1927 a French philosopher named Julien Benda wrote a small treatise called La Trahison des Clercs, The Betrayal of the Intellectuals, in which he called out the French and German professors of his day, the intellectuals of his day, saying that they were abandoning their academic mission of searching for truth, and knowledge, and reason, and instead embracing an activism that was based on the most vile and basest kinds of nationalists and racist ideologies including anti-Semitism. And he said that the academic life in his day, in 1927, had actually degenerated to what he called the intellectual organization of political hatreds, and again first and foremost anti-Semitism. And he predicted in 1927 that that betrayal of European intellectual life was going to lead to the most devastating war that the world would ever know. And he was unbelievingly prescient. And I think that it's important for us to remember that because the conditions that he spoke about, this betrayal of the intellectuals, is no less true today than it was in 1927. And I think that we have to be afraid, very afraid, of the implications of that, not just for Jews, not just for Jewish students, but really for everyone in the world. (dramatic music) - The technological improvement of people's lives, at a level that would only have been imagined in fantasies in the past, has created the illusion for us that the normal vicissitudes of existence don't count for us anymore. And so we keep elevating our expectations about existence to the therapeutic level, that is the level of feelings, not only will we be well fed and safe, but we will be happy continually. We will not feel regret, we will not feel any sort of negative consequences, including from our own actions, and that's what makes it dangerous. It makes it dangerous because it fosters the illusion that our actions don't have consequences, and when they do have consequences, it's the fault of some glitch in the system. - In the progress of Europe, and of Western civilization in the 18th and 19th century, women became more and more able to claim their own rights and the rights of individuals, the rights of citizens. Gradually they gained the vote. Gradually they were given rights before the law that they didn't have before. I think even more to the good was what science and technology provided for women, and it really solved problems that had been insoluble for centuries. If you read the Bible for example, you see that the most painful thing for women is that they cannot bear children. Well science and technology began to not only control for contraception but also for infertility. And then put an end to infant mortality practically, and made child bearing easier, so that all of this should have been greeted with gratitude. What happened instead, in America for sure, is that Betty Friedan's book for example, The Feminine Mystique, came in and applied Marxist terminology to the gender situation. So, saying that the same idea of class warfare is now extended to gender warfare. And that women have to fight not just for equal opportunity, but for equal outcome. And if there were so many men in something then there should be so many women in something, and that women were sort of considered to be the products of some kind of male formulation that they had just been playing these roles because men wanted them to play these roles. So there you took this most sensitive area, and suddenly you politicized it, and you said that this was contentious. That this was not something that people were in it always together, to figure out how they fit, and whether that fit was slightly changed now that so much had changed. It was none of that, it was grievance and blame. Women coming in with a politics of grievance and blame. - When I was learning anthropology, I was taught that there is no scientific basis for believing in races. It was also a time when people took politically a more classical liberal view, that we should be concerned not with the categories that people are members of, but with individuals and their personal characteristics. Well that's all gone now. Race is back, race is a good thing now. Not only race but gender, sexual preference, religion. Individuals have disappeared now into categories. - The things that my parents talked to me about and how they raised me, it was about faith, it was about freedom, it was about individual responsibility, quality education. It was about service to something greater than yourself. It was about that sense of family. And so, when you speak out about those things today, it's amazing to me how you get attacked, you get denigrated, you get called the names, the Uncle Tom sell out, the house N word, white man's porch monkey, oreo. And why, because there is a fear that somehow your message can get out. Look, I was a freshman United States congressman. I had never been in politics in my life. Why would I all of a sudden become the number one target for the liberal progressive left in the United States of America, which is what I was in the election cycle back in 2012. Millions upon millions of dollars were spent, all because it was an incredible success story. But that was not the narrative that people wanted to have out there. It was counter to the narrative that they want to have of victimization, of the welfare nanny state, the dependency society. And so you have to squelch that. But it's not just within the black community. You will find the same thing in the Jewish community. Be a conservative Jewish person. Be in the Hispanic community, be a conservative Hispanic. I mean the same will happen. Or, be a woman and stand up and be pro-life, and be conservative with some of your values and choices, you get the same treatment. - Chivalry began in the Middle Ages with the knightly class, and then died out with that knightly class within a couple of hundred years. It enjoyed a revival later in Victorian England, when writers and artists began to obsess over their idealized version of all things medieval. And this is where we get the Victorian gentleman from. The Victorian gentlemen is modeled on medieval knights and their chivalry. And chivalry died out once again with World War I, and with the rise of feminism in the early 20th century. The consequence of eradicating chivalry essentially from our society is that you have at least one generation of young men who don't know how to act as a man anymore. They don't know what the responsibilities and duties of men are. And you have a generation of young women who despise the thought of chivalry, because it offends their feminist sensibilities. They don't want a man opening the door for them because it implies that they are weak somehow, or that it is some kind of a gender power play. And so the consequence is that it drives the wedge between the sexes even deeper, among younger generations. What this does is create a lot of distrust and bitterness, and it has resulted in an entire subculture of men who have decided that they don't have anything to gain anymore from marriage, and settling down, and having a family. It affects the family unit in western civilization. It affects the birth rate which is a serious problem in the West. Germany for example has the lowest birth rate in the world. Italy is not far behind. So you see this happening all over Europe, and America is barely holding steady in terms of replacing the next generation. If we do not raise our boys and men with an understanding of a code of chivalry, a code of honor, a code of courage, and a code of service. If our young boys and men do not know what it means to be a man, what the duties and responsibilities of manhood are, then they will not be in a position to defend this culture from enemies without and within. (dramatic music) - A hundred years ago, people were committing terrorist acts in the name of radical nationalism, in the name of extreme socialism, Marxism, Leninism. They were committing terroristic acts in pursuit of a variety of different, secular ideologies. In our time, most terrorist acts, and one can base this on the data gathered by the START project at the University of Maryland, most terrorist acts, about 80%, are perpetrated by groups with some affiliation or another to Islamic extremism. They carry out most of the attacks. They claim most of the victims. In that sense, terrorism in our time has become predominantly a tactic of Islamic extremists. - Political Islam is about Islamist supremacy. It's about hegemony and control of not only the Muslim world but the Western world as well. And that is dangerous because it comes with violence, it comes with no respect for anyone following a different path. - The scourge of terrorism is yet another manifestation of a totalitarian mindset, that is intolerant of those who have different views. We have to be able to affirm and live by the principle that we cannot be tolerant of the intolerant. And unless we do that we lose. - Refusal to make the connection between Islamic Jihad and Islam itself is going to make matters worse. Because how can you defeat an enemy you wouldn't name? How can you defeat an ideology you refuse to understand? - One of the weaknesses of the West to my understanding is that somehow in their arrogance, they perceive the radicals to be these uncivilized ignoramuses, you know, working out of a cave in Tora Bora. And I don't know how much effort has been made to know the enemy, but the enemy definitely knows about us. - If one looks at the world as a whole, it's clear that Islamic extremism is a lethal virus that is killing a lot of people. What we must do is to stop it spreading. And the danger is that it will continue to spread. It has been increasing in the magnitude of killings, quite steeply since the onset of the so-called Arab Spring. The trend is, I think, pretty clearly upwards. And the number of groups seems also to be increasing. The number of converts to various forms of Islamic extremism also seems to be rising. - The Muslim Brotherhood dedicates its activities to da'wah, and da'wah is this complex system of persuading first Muslims, and then inviting non-Muslims into the fold of Islam. An extension of da'wah is Jihad, and the Islamic State and Al Qaeda are the militant, if you will, arm of da'wah. So their objectives are the same because they all aspire to societies governed by Islamic law. And their aspiration is global. It starts local, it starts within a unit as small as the individual, and then the family, the immediate community, the local, the nation, and it expands to the whole world. - The Brotherhood strategy in the West is subversion, it's stealth. It's burrowing into a host society and eating away at it from within, that's the strategy. Getting jobs in sensitive influential positions whether it's government, media, academia, community organizations in the local, the state, and the Federal level. - The totalitarians in our society, one way or another, are enabling by sins of omission or commission our totalitarian enemies abroad. - In France, I believe that any leniency shown to young perpetrators of violence against Jews and other targets is basically due to the fact that the magistrates of the generation of the 1968 student revolution. For them, these young people are victims of racism. How can a victim of racism also be an agent of racism? So they have introduced a revolving door where the young person comes in, is warned perhaps, or it's simply put under the pile, and he comes out, and then they do it again. - What is really extraordinary, is the degree to which the British people have tried to pretend that the threat that they face isn't actually as bad as it is, and they've tried to pretend that it's something completely different. - I have personally been on the ground in London in particular, and interviewed wanted terrorists who are linked to Osama bin Laden, linked to Al Qaeda. They're walking around the streets of London as free men, and not only free men but collecting welfare benefits from the government, from the state, from the British government that they have vowed to destroy. - In Britain, there was a terrible event where an off-duty soldier was effectively beheaded on a South London street in the middle of the afternoon by two guys shouting Allahu Akbar with cleavers, meat cleavers. People said clearly this was the most appalling atrocity. It was clearly an act of Jihadi terrorism, but most people came to the conclusion that they were basically mad, they were insane, and therefore it was nothing to do with religion. - The murder of Dr. Sarah Halimi, she was tortured, her neighbors heard what was going on. She was thrown out of her third-floor window by a Muslim neighbor to the cries of Allahu Akbar, and yet, the authorities are still holding him, or have for a long time held him in a psychiatric ward, and they are not prepared to recognize this as a hate crime. The media follow along. - There's a tendency in the mainstream media in particular, to downplay the threat, to give off the impression that it's just a criminal action. Yes there was a terrorist attack, but this is not part of a larger theme or a larger movement. It's just some lone isolated wacko carrying out attack on his or her own. The problem is these lone wolves, so-called lone wolves, are marching to the same drumbeat. It's an ideological drumbeat, that's the key. If you do not understand the ideology, you cannot defeat this movement. They are part, these lone wolves, quote unquote, are part of a global jihadist movement where they may not even know each other. There may be no contact, many of them have never been to the caliphate, to Syria, to Iraq, to fight alongside ISIS, but they are galvanized by the message and by the ideology. So that makes this, even though there may be no interpersonal contact in some cases, that makes this an interconnected global movement that spans across continents. - There are many different answers to why there is resistance among Westerners to acknowledge that the terrorism that we see, the violence, the intolerance, the misogyny, has its foundations in Islamic doctrine. I think part of it has to do with respect for minorities, Muslims in the West are minorities. Part of it has to do with religious tolerance, we are told you know you have to, even though you disagree with, or you know maybe you find it appalling, but you are to tolerate the other's religion. Now here's the problem, it's not reciprocal. Muslims who are Islamists, who believe that society should be governed under Islamic law, that is Sharia, are not tolerant of the religions of others, or the lack of religion. - Remember, 100 years ago, the Bolsheviks were still a relatively marginal extremist group in the Russian Empire. It was in 1917 that their revolution gave them power over initially a part of that empire, and ultimately the whole of it. And the Soviet Union then became the single, biggest threat to individual freedom of the 20th century. The longest lasting of the totalitarian regimes. It is not inconceivable that in our time, Islamic extremists could take control of a large part of the Middle East. They already control some of it. Imagine if they controlled Saudi Arabia? The holy places and the oil. The dream of a caliphate, of a restored and purified Islamic state is not just the fantasy of a few cranks. Any more than the dream of a Soviet Union was just the fantasy of Lenin and his confederates. Such things can happen. (dramatic music) - While Jews and Christians often don't recognize themselves in the other, or what they share in common, people standing on the outside actually recognize it very well. So you have figures as diverse as Friedrich Nietzsche, the great sort of German philosopher and a father of postmodernism, and Sayyid Qutb, who was a Muslim thinker, intellectual, who was one of the founders, intellectual founders, of the Muslim Brotherhood, saying almost the exact same thing when they look at Jews and Christians. Nietzsche, in his book, he wrote a famous book called Genealogy of Morals, and when he talked about Jews and Christians, he lumped them in the same category. "They are bringing this moral vision into the world that has "clouded our thinking," says Nietzsche. "They need to be opposed. "That whole system Jews and Christians created "needs to be undermined." Sayyid Qutb said almost the same exact thing but from a Muslim perspective. He is saying Jews and Christians, or Jews and Crusaders, as he would call it, "They share something that is inimical "to our way of life as Muslims." And so you have these threats coming from two directions at least, and Jews and Christians insofar as they don't recognize that they are on the same side, or even what they share, or the substance of the culture that they are trying to preserve, will be really at a loss in trying to confront these threats from both postmodern secularism and fundamentalist Islam. - If you look outside of the US, you can see that attacks that are perpetrated against the larger society often contain plans and motivations to attack Jewish symbols and Jewish targets. So, if you look at Mumbai, the attack in Mumbai in 2008, you have an attack against Western hotels, transportation hubs, and a small Chabad synagogue that doesn't really fit the larger target scheme, but was Jewish and therefore attackers were sent to go murder the rabbi and his wife. If you look at Paris and the Charlie Hebdo attacks, the larger and more prominent attack occurred against Charlie Hebdo, secondary attack from an accomplice occurred against a kosher market, and reports indicate that this was only because a Jewish school was unable to be attacked because of the large mobilization of security forces. And you can also look at the 2015 attack in which a free-speech demonstration, or free-speech gathering was attacked, and then the secondary attack was against a synagogue, in which a Jewish volunteer security officer was murdered. - Decades of Holocaust education have not contained anti-Semitism. In some degree it's the opposite, where the mourning for Jews that were murdered 70 years ago is acceptable, it had become decoupled from the victims of anti-Semitism today. Palestinians are claiming that they were also victims of the Holocaust, because as a result of the Holocaust, the European powers, particularly Britain, inflicted the Jewish survivors upon them. Or for example, young people who want to close the chapter. And I have even heard as far as we cannot forgive the Jews for turning us the Germans into murderers. - 70 years, 75 years after the Holocaust, for a German government to engage the Iranian regime in an agreement that transfers over a hundred billion dollars to a regime that incites to genocide, that uses the old Nazi German tropes against Jews. Never mind against their fellow countrymen, and Yazdis, and women, and gay people, and all the democratic principles that they want to destroy. The fact that the Germans have done that, to me is a clear, clear, clear lesson. There is nothing more clear that the Germans have not learnt from the Holocaust. - We think of the Middle East as the Arab world, or the Muslim world, but the fact of the matter is up until well into the 11th, 12th, 13th century, most of the people who lived in the Middle East were Christians or Jews, and they were scattered everywhere. They weren't isolated in little pockets. And subsequent centuries of really colonization of those societies resulted in this gradual process of really elimination of those ancient communities, of the indigenous Christians, of the indigenous Jewish communities. So that when the 20th century opens up, we have only about 10% of the region made up of these much smaller communities. And over the course of the 20th century, and coming into our own day, those communities were made even smaller by persecution, by oppression, and really in our day extreme violence that borders on genocide. So these communities today are facing, not just sort of a story of persecution, it's a story of annihilation. They are on the brink of disappearing. The Jewish people have managed to survive because they've gone into their homeland and chosen to defend themselves. The Christians have not yet done that, and so they are being scattered, and many of them are being killed. - In 2016 alone, more Christians were martyred than any other year in the last 2,000 years. The rate is one Christian every six minutes is martyred somewhere around the world. And by being martyred for the faith, for the Christian faith, by that I mean that it was because of their identification, with a Christian message, and all that that represents that they gave their life. - The persecution of Christians in the Middle East is significant, and a lot of observers and analysts have essentially said it's worse than at any time in history. It's worse than the famous Roman-Pagan persecution under Diocletian in 4th century. Now a lot of the persecution that goes on, essentially the burning down of churches, the abduction of Christian women and children, the killing of apostates, Muslims who convert to Christianity, attacking, imprisoning, sometimes killing, so-called blasphemers. For instance, in Pakistan a wife and a husband, Christian couple were literally burned alive, because they were accused of somehow offending Mohammed. And, you know, some countries like in Nigeria, a week doesn't go by that I don't read about dozens of Christians being killed by groups like Boko Haram. But not just Boko Haram, and that's the important thing to understand. It's not just formal Islamic terrorist groups. This is happening by mobs. This is happening by Muslim individuals. This is happening by Muslim governments, such as our good friend and ally Saudi Arabia, which has a fatwa saying if ever any church is found it must be destroyed on the Peninsula in accordance with the Prophet's wishes, which is recorded in one of his Hadith. - Even though we in the West want to say look, it's not a holy war, this is not a Christian, Jewish, Muslim conflict, many, many, many Muslims, even though they're a minority of the Muslim world, these are millions of people, see the world and the future in exactly those terms. This is Jihad, this is a holy war, our God versus your God, and we are going to win. And that is what they are saying. And we in the West, many of us, we're so reluctant to talk in those terms. We're so reluctant to talk about our God, or our values, or our culture beyond sort of the merest mention of democracy, or something like that, that we don't know what to say in return. So we just stand there as they speak you know trying to talk past them, and they are not changing their mind whatsoever. They see this as a holy war, and they are not going to stop until they win. (dramatic music) - Societies that want to really expand at your expense, those are very easy to identify. We see them now in the form of Jackboots, and black uniforms with a swastika. That will forever be our image of the horrors of overt aggression, of really wanting to conquer the world, wanting to conquer Europe, wanting to conquer other countries. I think that from an intellectual point of view, and from a psychological point of view those things are easy to identify. and they're easier to confront because they come at you so you can defend against them. What is much harder to defend against, and that's why I think it's much more lethal, are ideas like Marxism that come and says hey, there's an unfairness in life. Why should there be some rich and some poor? I'm simplifying here but that's basically the idea of egalitarianism. Why should there be some stronger and some weaker? Let's level everything. In the Bible, you have this problem addressed so that you know that when a rich man has a field he has to leave part of the field for the poor to come. So, it is addressed in some way that the rich, that the more powerful have to take responsibility for those who have less. There is a kind of negotiation that takes place among classes in society, among people in society. But if you say that your goal is to enforce this equality, equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity, this is an extraordinarily dangerous philosophy, a very dangerous idea. And it is an idea that has taken over the campuses in a very practical way. It's taken over whole swaths of our society and the people who are dedicated to this idea think themselves to be in the avant garde of human civilization. In fact, what this has to become is a kind of totalitarian system because they have to flatten, and they have to make sure that they do it through a kind of social engineering that needs to use its power against people, and it squelches all those other qualities of freedom, of enterprise, of trial and error. - The lesson of history on the issue of immigration is very clear. Immigration is not necessarily, and not always a bad thing. I should know, I'm an immigrant. I'm a beneficiary of the free movement of people. But, you cannot have unfettered, unregulated migration. You cannot have a world without borders. And that is because the state, which is the fundamental political unit of the world, loses its legitimacy in the eyes of its own citizens if anybody can just cross the border, and enjoy the benefits of citizenship. When it has been successful, think of the United States in the 19th century. Immigration has been, even on a very large scale, regulated. And combined with policies to encourage the rapid assimilation and integration of the immigrants. There was no doctrine of multiculturalism in the 19th century that said that immigrants from Eastern Europe or Southern Europe should as far as possible preserve their native tongues and practices. On the contrary, they were strongly encouraged to become American as fast as they could, and by in large their children and grandchildren did become Americans with amazing speed. And in defiance of the pessimism of nativists, in the late 19th century, who were convinced that you would never make Americans out of the Irish. Or you would never make Americans out of the Italians. Today we face a similar kind of challenge. We have large-scale migration from Mexico, but we also have large-scale migration from the Muslim world. The Muslim population of the United States by some estimates is growing faster today than the Muslim population of any European country, at about 5% a year. Driven by quite large-scale migration from Muslim countries all over the world. This should not pose a problem, but it will if we allow multiculturalism to dictate that assimilation and integration are optional, and that if they wish, Muslims in America can live under Sharia Law. Those people who make that kind of argument fundamentally misunderstand what immigration is about. If you come to the United States and aspire to become an American citizen, you must accept that the Constitution is the ultimate law of the land. Sharia Law cannot be above it. You must accept that there is a separation of politics and religion. That is part of the hard-wiring of the American system. - When I look at where we are today, the values and principles that we hold dear in Western liberal democratic societies, they cannot exist without the rule of law. When you go back and you think about forcing King John to sign the Magna Carta. When you think about the Constitution of the United States of America, it all starts with the rule of law. If you have people that believe the rule of law is not important, that they can thumb their nose at it, and that you will have mob rule instead, or the rule of certain individuals, then you will undermine the very thing that makes us unique and the very reason why people come here from other places where they don't have the same freedoms and opportunities and liberties. - In order to get rid of a bad idea, you have to have the proliferation of good ideas, and let them battle it out in the marketplace of ideas. What political correctness does is it declares war on the marketplace of ideas, and it says you can't talk about that, that's offensive, and why that's so dangerous, and why it's such a chilling effect on free speech is because when you judge things or punish speech or ideas because they're offensive, because they are hate speech, the speaker doesn't know until after the fact what is going to be offensive. So what happens is you have a society that's self-censoring out of fear of being offensive. Or in Europe for example, fear of jail time, because they actually put people in Europe in jail for hate speech. Fortunately, in the United States, that's not the case. We have Supreme Court ruling after Supreme Court ruling saying that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects even the most vile of speech, even the most offensive speech because the Supreme Court has recognized that even the most offensive speech is absolutely crucial for the marketplace of ideas to sort it out. - Rousseau wrote a book about the social contract that became one of the great tracts of the French Revolutionary era. Edmund Burke, the Anglo-Irish-Whig philosopher countered that the real social contract was between the dead, the living, and the unborn. It's one of the great lines in his reflections on the revolution in France. Burke seems to me to have got it right. Any civilization is only as good as the strength of that contractual bond between the past, the present, and the future. The dead, the living, the unborn. I think Western Civilization at its best was extraordinarily good at thinking of posterity, and also at respecting the legacy of the past. Today, we have breached the contract spectacularly. The word posterity seldom appears in politicians' speeches for a reason. Because the politics of our era has essentially reversed the direction of the sacrifice. We used to sacrifice for the sake of future generations. That's why my grandfathers fought in the world wars. They were very consciously fighting to make my life better. I hadn't even been born. In the post-war era, the generation that we call the Baby Boomers decided to switch things around, and encourage posterity to sacrifice for them. (dramatic music) - I think that the key to the question of Western Civilization is the preservation of moral confidence, does one have it, do you feel it, can you articulate it? Can you explain why what this civilization has created and become is so precious that it should be maintained? Can one explain it well enough to one's children? Can one build the institutions that can actually keep it alive? This is not anything that one can take for granted, and the idea that one can just really take it for granted is in itself very destructive. - It's vitally important to stand up for democracy, not just democracy as in voting, democracy as in freedom. And it's what the great Soviet refusenik Natan Sharansky, then known as Anatoly Scharansky, taught us from a Soviet prison, is that the belief in freedom, and the commitment to freedom has to guide our thinking and our moral moments as we embrace our own collective self-concept as Western moral actors in a world whose moral fabric is being unwound by radical elements all around us. - What do Jews and Christians share? What is it that sort of binds the Western story together? For me, that story is bound together by the Hebrew Bible. And Jews and Christians, unlike Jews and other groups in the world, or Christians and other groups in the world, we share a text, we actually share a physical text. You can point to a word, I can point to a word, and we can argue over what it means, and that's unique I think among world civilizations, and what comes out of that text, the ideas, the values, the stories, those are the guts of the West. That is the stuff that makes us who we are. These are the reference points for literature, for modern philosophy. This is the thought world that we all operate in. And a lot of people want to pretend like that's not true, moving into sort of a post-Christian or post-religious future, but the fact of the matter is, that is who we are, and to the extent that we try to forget that, the more confused and aimless our civilization will be. - It's not about left or right, it's about all of us. It's about the future of our children and grandchildren. It's about the future of the globe. - Whether you, watching this film, consider yourself Western or not, Western Civilization broadly defined as the ideas that emanated from Europe and its off-shoots, in the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, had more benefits and has more benefits than costs. Nobody claims that it was perfect, because Western Civilization has been in a constant process of self-improvement and will continue to improve itself. But it may also destroy itself if we collectively forget how powerful the benefits of political freedom, of economic freedom are. Everybody benefits from those freedoms. They have no color, they have no creed. They work everywhere, but they will cease to work if we, the heirs of the Western tradition, stop believing in them.
