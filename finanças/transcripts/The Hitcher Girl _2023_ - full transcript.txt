Drama at the lake! As you all recall, our summer of 1995 saw an unprecedented heat with perhaps this contributed to our team going down for a picnic at the lake. Unaware of what was to occur. The murky depths of the lake became the grave of our college graduate, Lisa Jenkins. Her inconsolable fiancee, Tom, still in training at the police department of our fair city, was helpless to protect her. It was later determined that Lisa Jenkins was unable to swim. What caused these dire circumstances? Ignorance of a loved one. Disregard for rules of both above water. Recreation. Regardless, the death of this promising. Young beauty shook the community. It was determined by Parks and Recreation to temporarily shut down the lake to swimming until details surrounding the drowning were fully investigated. Ok! On our community calendar we have the birthday of our well-known parrot Polly. She is 52 years old. Polly, the dancing parrot. Happy birthday! And who? Who did that Segway? All right. Let's wrap it up. She came out of nowhere. She just walked out onto the road and raised her hand. She was naked. Not even panties on. But she could handle herself. It's just like in those times. When any gorgeous babe would give herself away to a stranger with a glass of water. Just because the world was beautiful. And they were all carrying. And LSD. What?! You don't believe me? That's how it was! You do know who the hippies were?! Don't you?! I remember it as it very yesterday, my youth. And then it just swept on by their entire life. Why would you say such a thing? She had her panties on! Oh, no, not at all! I knew where to look! You have to be watchful when you're behind the wheel! Could you describe this girl? She was a bit out of sorts. Scared and lost, like from another space. She reminded me of Sarah when we met with my wife at the "Lynyrd Skynyrd" concert. She was same. I wasn't naked. We get it, a glass of water. What else can you tell me about your hitcher? Could you describe her in a bit more detail for me? You don't have a picture? No, ma'am. Unfortunately, we do not. We have to rely on the descriptions of the people she's met in order to create a good sketch. Well, let's start with her eyes. She had unforgettable eyes. Yes, they were... They were such a look in them. Unforgettable. Yes. Her eyes were a bit moist, perhaps from wind or tears. So you just stopped and picked up a complete stranger on the road. I mean, a naked, random stranger in a place where no one can be seen for miles. So what if she was dangerous? Oh, hell, no! She was helpless! You do the same thing. She radiated with warmth, you know what I mean? And then she wasn't naked all the time. We gave her some clothes. Yeah, yeah... Lilith, my name is Lilith exactly like that. With two "I"s and "T H" at the end. At school, for people, I introduced myself as Liliana or just Lil. Nobody wants to associate you with Babylon beastia. What are you talking about, sweetheart? You don't know? Lilith is Adams' first wife that was created FOR him not as Eva was made from his rib, but together with him. 96. At least that's what Kabbalah says also that's how they called a demon in the ancient scrolls of the Dead Sea written Hebrew. I don't know why my parents have chosen this name for me. Who are your parents? I don't have a mum, but my dad... Well, he's got God... I don't remember them. But you're not from around here. Are you? Oh, I am local. I was born by the sea far away... And moved. I grew up here. Yeah. If there is one place on earth where ecumenical flood won't reach you, it's our little tribe! No thing further than the sea. That's for sure. So where are you heading to? A little Lil. Oh, to California. Oh, California. I'm so sorry, sweetie. We won't be able to take you that far. We are heading to Osborne to our children. The eldest just moved to a new, shiny place full of beautiful people. My son's name is Mickey. He provides computer support. All the automatic milking machines on the farms. He's a big. Shot. Shiny new place. Seriously? It's bullshit! He jump from one hole to another. It is Idaho. It's nowhere. What can you expect from him? From them? Well, tell me, honey. Maybe you need some help. Should we call someone? Maybe police or relatives? You know, when we met, you had no clothes on. And that, Honestly, is a little weird. It's none of our business, of course. But... But you're very kind, Sarah and you, Jeff. I don't know what I've done without you. I have nothing to pay with. I can tell you a story that happened to me and you're right. It was kind of weird. I was driving six hours in my car. You know, too long. And I was tired, so I decided to stop and chill. There's a small grove by the Elk Lake, just before Troy. Do you know this place? Course we do. It's a quiet place. Oh, in spring there are loads of trout down the stream! Once me and my fellows... Jeff, Don't interrupt! Let the girl talk! For quite some time I was lying in the grass, under the clouds. Enjoying the wind. Sun started to burn my skin. So I decided to go for a swim. No one was around. So, I got naked. Why shouldn't I? I was having a nice swim when suddenly I heard my car starting and it just went off on its own. My car without me in it... Well, how can that be? It just went off on its own? You mean someone got inside your car when you were having a swim? Yes. And you know what's the most appalling? That guy took all my clothes. Why would anyone take away clothes? Don't you understand? He'll be doing some kinky stuff with that later. Not to be seen in front of the ladies. Oh. So this means as some sort of. Pervert. Stole your car and your clothes? I guess it is. Do cars often get stolen in Troy? Oh, God, no. It never happens. Biggest crime I can recall is when a teenage couple with fake guns robbed Jimmy Masterson's gas station. The police arrived and even Sheriff Tom came. It was all kinds of bustle and ruckus about it. But the point is. I get it, I get it. Bonnie and Clyde from the beginning. What do you mean? Doesn't this story seem strange to you? With the stolen car, the stolen clothes swimming in such cold water. Perhaps your hitcher was lying to you. No, Lilith was an honest girl. She asked us to drop her off at the crossroads of Burke Road and 90 Interstate Highway just before the entrance to Wallace. We haven't seen her since. There's nothing more to say. By the way, Lilith is a good girl. She's not a liar. If you really need to blame someone, maybe you wanna think about what happens to the cows disappearing each year at Toby Gilligan's and Frank Pippins farms as on schedule, cows disappear. Now you're going to tell me that the government does know about aliens and it's not them. Then maybe you should consider what you boys are doing. Oh, what! Praying (Hebrew) Your heart is full of faces... How would you describe her? I remember her smell oh folks. That can help us. That was the first thing that came to mind. It's not what you asked for? But also. She's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah, we got that. So what about the smell? She smelled of coffee. And there was a barely noticeable scent of lilac. Who does he get the lilac from? Carry on, Kyle. You've got our attention. Hey. Hey there! You're alive or something? Maybe she needs help. Hey, do I look like a doctor or lifeguard to you? Well, then why did you stop? There's no one around. She could get hit! Burnout in the sun. You know. Then you're not a lifeguard nor doctor. You're fireman! Hey, you're lost, sort of? Not at all. I/m not lost. Just been found. Hold on. Found? What the hell are you doing here? Just praying. I asked Yahweh to send me a good travel companion. And did it help? You stopped. Are you, like, a fanatic or what? No. Just believe in God. So bad? I guess... All right, let's go! Hi! My name is Lil. What's yours? Pinky! It's your brother? His name's Kyle. Nobody gave you permission to get in! No one gave you one either. Me? What do you mean? Look, this is a 15. It's an interstate freeway, right? And you just pass the border from Idaho to Utah. But according to the law, if you do so, you must have an ID with you where it clearly says that you're over 21. That's right. I am 21. What's wrong with that? I just look younger. He just turned 17! Ted Jenkins and. Sally came to his birthday. But Morgan was a no show. He waited all day and a night before. And by the way, Kyle doesn't know how to shave! She pinky, shut up! Don't worry. I know how to keep secrets. So where are we heading to? Oh, heading south to Elk Ridge. It's still Utah. Perfect! Let's roll. Cool. Currently, the engine heats up. Races sucks. Otherwise, it's a beast. Kyle, you are not a dragster. You are quite the curious fella, Kyle. My question is, why wouldn't you ask your hitcher how she ended up in this empty and desolate road? I didn't want to pry. But surely you've told her about yourself, right? Maybe told her a couple small lies. Can I go? Sure. But first, you're going to tell us what happened at the gas station by Oak Ridge. No, it's a little. Not George, quite often. We played baseball at Troy Bat, but I was wondering one. Do you like baseball? I like the angels. Here's a new one. When Dad left, we stopped playing. Eddie likes hockey more. He's from Canada. Eddie, he's your new dad? No, he's mom's new husband, but he's not dad to me. He hits mom, abuses Kyle. So you two took his car? Hot dog! You'd better return car to your stepfather. If you get caught, you will be in trouble. They won't catch me. Nobody knows where we are and where we're going. Really? Let me guess. You're heading to your father. How did you know? I wasn't hard. Where are you going? Running away from someone just like us? To the beach. What do you mean? Where? Here's one place in California. On the way to Los Angeles. Beautiful place, white sand, blue ocean and nothing else. What's there? Nothing. Just beautiful. Have you ever been there? No. But I will one day. At sunset, angels bathe there. No one can see them. I thought angels play baseball. Different ones. Real angels. Didn't you know? Here you aer, little shit! Got you! Can you even imagine what they'll do to you in prison when they'll find out that you've kidnapped your little sister? Next time, they're going to treat you as they did your father. They're going to fuck you up, buddy. That's usually what they do too fast. It's like Pete's blood. Don't worry. I'll teach you how to show respect. Even if your father didn't! Come here! Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Kids bullshitting all day. Ask him about that piece and see how he reacts. Well, Kyle. A beach somewhere near Los Angeles. That's something. Something. I've got to ask you one more thing. What's she like? Lilith. She's brave. Hey, that's my bat! Hey, lady, are you gonna pay! I'm gonna call the police! Remember this! If even once in your dreams, you see yourself behind the wheel in my car again, I'll beat the shit out of you till you piss blood for a month! Got it, little buster?! Never hit kids! Run! Sheriff. We've got some news. We now know the location. Speak. It's a beach between L.A. and Malibu. Exact place is not known yet. But we can track her now. Have you established her identity? Not yet, sir. We're working on it. We hope to catch her before she reaches California border. Further away from home. The harder it is to deal with local authority. Okay, then. Carry on, Alonzo. I need this animal alive or whatever. Yes, sir. Shit. Now, girl, if you're going to be hiking in desert, you can't be hiking with so big ass dildo! You understand, not a killer, fuck off? Damn, surely not. What kind of killer! I. I don't know. Maybe lady on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Are you trainees? No, ma'am. We are not trainees. We are gender neutrals. We are so Cosmo sexual. Sticking out of anal. Joe is aliens? No, honey. We cross from place to place. Where They have landed. Do you know what's out there? This is area. Fucking 51, baby. Come on. Oh, man. Right people always welcome. Kind of need to go to California. Okay. We'll drop you off in Vegas. Come on in! Come on, honey. We got to ride her! By the sea, by the sea (song) No. What can I say about the girl? She's a local. But she's going for a good time. She won't hurt back. She won't hurt a fly, huh? How about now? Oh. My gosh. I told you. Are you going to Los Angeles? Yes. Can I come with you? Well, I have to stop in Barstow. I have to sleep there. In a morning, I will go to Los Angeles. Wonderful. I don't have money. Well, then a blowjob. One here and one when we get to Barstow. Do you think I'm a hooker? And what is their? Vegas. And what is that? Highway. And what is this? Your truck. Well, there you go. That means you're a hooker. If you don't have money, you have to suck. Everybody does. I'm not familiar with the practices of hookers, but I'm pretty sure that's what exactly they do. The thing is, you're wrong about me. I'm not one of them. Sorry for disappointing you. I better go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I look up once on a road, you know? I will take you to Los Angeles. And I don't need your money. I no blowjobs too. Okay? Okay. Lilith. Gevorg. Listen, you have a light hand. Do you get the good luck with those casino games on the phone? Blackjack, roulette, the dice. I don't gamble. Come on. Everybody does. I'm not everybody. Listen, do me a favor here. Choose the game and play for me. Do you want me to play a roulette for you? If you choose a roulette, it is a roulette! My wife died ten years ago. Cancer. You know, she got in the same year. We came from Armenia. I have no kids. I have no home. I have only this truck. But I'm all alone in this big, big world. I think you love your wife very much. Since you didn't get married a second time. The pain. The pain in my chest will not go away for a long, long time, years and years. And then I was not looking for one. Why? Because there is no love left inside of me. It all dripped out, like from the broken jar. Drop by, drop by drop... Oh, have I pressed something wrong? Why is it making all this noise? I told you! I told you have a luckyhand! I told you have a lucky hand! We need ATM! Listen, you don't know what you did! Here. This is your commission. You brought me luck, girl. I've never seen anybody winning such a big bucks on the phone, casino. So much. Depends what you're comparing to. What should I do with it? Do whatever you want. This is your money. Hey, I got you a separate room and one for me. If you want to go to sleep, you can go. But I'm going to go to a bar right across the street for a glass of whiskey. I have to just take my clothes, change it, and shower and go. I don't need to go to Los Angeles. Well, we'll be there tomorrow morning. I have to be at the truck show at 10:00, so don't worry about it. Are you in a hurry? Not really. Then this is your room key. Thank you. We're in Los Angeles. You're going? I think next time I can be taxi driver. Zula Beach. Do you know. What is it? Well, of course I know Zula Beach. There is a seagulls. Dolphins there. Gevorg will take you there just in time. Are you coming to drink with me? I don't drink. You don't know what you're losing. You don't know what you're losing. Sorry. Hey, buddy! Double scotch, top shit! Expensive one? No, the most expensive. I mean, fucking cool whiskey. You got it. Howdy, cowboy. What are you drinking with such a serious face? Walker. No, no, no. Let me treat you to the real stuff. Hey, buddy, double my order for two. No girl never paid for my drink before. It's obvious you're the generous, macho type you pay for the others right? I bet there are loads of broken hearts on your sleeve. First of all, I did not break anything. The second I can pay for my whiskey myself. Let me do this for you. Seriously, I need a cood drink tonight. It's quite sad to drink alone, but if I treat a good man means I'm sort of independent. Sort of officially. You know what I mean? I'm kind of celebrating. I've just got divorced 5 hours ago, In Vegas, baby. Woohoo! Jackpot! Now my ex can finally go fuck himself. He's a total ass. Screwed all my girlfriends, maybe even our little dog got some dtoo. Who knows? Listen, I want to forget it all. Like a bad, bad dream. Oh, and I'm a free bird now. I wanted to get wasted so bad. I skipped going home I'll drink on the road right here. Now you get me? More or less but I can still pay for my drink. You are a stubborn one. Okay then let's do it this way. I pay for the first round. Second round's on you. Deal? Hey, buddy, put those glasses down and bring me the most expensive whiskey you have in this bar. And I am paying. Don't take any money from this young lady. Have you ever called the hooker? No. You? I have now. Pick one. Who's the smartest? NO disrespect. Smartest? You like to talk? It's an extra 100 for talking. Okay. Vicky! Hey, we are all smart here! Shut it, Sherry. Vicky is going to be cruising the French Riviera soon. You'll still be polishing the freeway until you get dumped out of Reno. Fat chance. But this is not for me. It's a gift. We need to think of a story somewhere where you're not a whore, but a normal girl. And again, no disrespect. Huh? Well, it's the next 100 on top for all the acting and improvization. Okay. And could you wash your makeup off, please? With pleasure. Okay, well, let's have some fun. And then two bloodhounds came. I saw them through the window. I understood that they're here to catch me. As soon as I sensed, I ran away from the motel. I already got it. You're running away from bad cops. But what I don't get is what you've done that's so terrible that they're following you from state to state. What are you doing here, huh? Following me like them? And as long as I can see, you're still in the at stolen car. Aren't you happy to see me? I saved your ass, by the way, huh? Actually, I did follow you. I mean, I followed the cops that were after you to find you. The first time I saw them, I said. I said more than I should have. And then I couldn't stop thinking that I shouldn't have done that. And. I guess I betrayed you or something, so I decided to fix it. Now I've come to take you to the ocean. The lesson. I'm doing this. So you have a crush on me? Are you stupid? Don't you? What were you doing in the desert? I already told you I was praying. Hey, bro, what is that? Looks like a cactus. I think it's a girl. And check it out. Two legs, two tits, two ears sticking out. Yeah, it's a chick. What the fuck is she doing out here? Growing like a cactus? I think she was thrown out from a truck. Sometimes truckers throw the bitchy ones out, right in the middle of the road. No shit! Lesson. Happens, bro. Raccoon told me. Yeah. Raccoon is woman a fucking liar! Oh, man. His dad drives trucks. Raccoon knows Shit. Hey, bitch! Didn't wanna take with a rubber on? Or maybe your ass is too precious? Hey, come on. Why chicks are always so rude to me?! I ask, no answer. Then when no one asks they won't shut up! The fucking pepper, You talking too much? Shut up, squirm. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Why so daring, huh? You're right. It was a fucking cactus. You know, it doesn't rain much in the desert. Cactuses don't live long without rain. Like there's no rain in the desert. And baby, you ain't a. On your knees now! Hands fucking out! Oh. All right. Hey, I'm down. I'm down. See that gone down, big guy? Mm hmm. She goes with me. It's ok, all right? I'll kill them! You look at yourself, just shaking. What the hell are you doing out here? I was praying to send me a good travel companion. And did it help? Well... Here you are. Where did you get the gun? Do you like it? You stole it, right? I think you'll worry about me. You were just a teenager that had a fight with parents. And now you're a criminal because of me. My dad has the same. There's the law, and then there's justice. I did the right thing. Finally arrived and has similar sayings. It's not a big deal. I lifted the gun at the guard shack with a mustang was towed. I did it when my stepfather was bullshitting the cops. What's that smell? I need wash up. Lilith? I don't know what she has done, but she's a good girl. Yeah. We're not saying she's bad. She's Just in danger. Like the worst kind of danger. Life or death. She's going to Zula Beach. She left last night. I hope everything is good with her. What's a pity we missed her. What a pity. Zula beach, huh? Yes. You shouldn't have say anything. The cops, liars. And you miss a hooker? I assume. Get the fuck out of here. Yeah. We're going to go ahead and let you to carry on. If you weren't so tired yesterday, we could have taken a closer look at these motel guests. Today, we could have been on our way home. Mission accomplished, man. We can't work 24/7. Really? Because we almost got her. I know what happened. That girl stopped us and then she fucking got away. So what now? Zula Beach! We don't need to ask anybody else. We're going straight there. You really going to comply with what Tom said? I mean, we don't have to kill her, do we? We can just catch her. Like those senators in that House. Why the change of heart? Look at all the people we've met. All of them. They're saying the same thing. She's brave, she's kind, she's beautiful. She's smart. Yeah. What would you expect? A fucking maniac that eats the faces of her victims? No. But does any of it make sense to you? I mean, seriously... Any of it? Listen, she brutally killed the sheriff's son, so he has a right to revenge, not by the law, but by parent's retribution. You have a son of your own? Plus, we owe Sheriff. Don't forget it, Alonzo. So here's our chance. Yeah. We shoot a girl while she's trying to escape. No. Be more pragmatic. By killing her, we rid the world of this malicious insect posing as a beautiful, smart, brave when they call her a good girl? But in fact, it's all an illusion. Am I making sense here? I don't know, man. Maybe you're right. Thank you. Good. Let's go. Get in the car. Let's do our job. There's a few more bottles left, so you can use all this water if you need. Can you help? Sure. Go on, then. Hello! You're there? Straight on your head? Well, yeah. You hungry? Oh yeah! Like a bunch of coyotes! I have a few jurkeys left and some chips and a few chocolate bars too. Cool. Is LA far? About 3 hours. Okay, let's go then. Fuck. Maybe their engine overheated? I don't know. Probably. What can I do? Catch a ride? No more hitching for you. What then? I need to go to the ocean. Let's wait till dusk The engine will cool down and should start. We just need to wait a bit. Okay then. How about lunch at the Five Star Hotel? Do you have a boyfriend? Had one. Did you break up? Yep. How long ago? 25 years ago. Tomorrow is the anniversary. 25 years ago... in kindergarten? How old are you? Ancient. Why did you break up? He was too jealous. He drowned me in the lake and told everyone it was an accident. People believed him. Very funny. If you don't want to talk about your boyfriend, it's okay. Are you upset? Don't be. Oh, it was a sense of humor. I'm getting used to it. Do you have a girlfriend, Kyle? No. What about me? What about you? Am I not your girlfriend? What are you doing? Stealing from the stealer. Give that back to me. You might should someone. Oh, where were we? Oh, yeah. You're about to kiss me. I changed my mind. That's a shame. Almost got no sleep today because of you. I'd love to get some sleep too. If you don't mind. Sweet dreams. It's a huge sin to steal from the one who sleeps. I steall when you're awake then. Hey, Stacey, take it easy. I got it under control. He just intertained with partner. Not here. Over. Somebody had enough. Didn't catch up with your girlfriend? What do you all want from her? You're chasing like she's some kind of Russian spy! What is Lilith done that's so terrible? Third degree murder, buddy. So we chased her, right? And by the way, it depends on you whether you go down as a witness or as a partner in crime to help us find her, you'll get off easier. What the hell? She didn't kill anyone. I'm just a regular highway patrol. I don't know details. When investigators come, you can tell them all you want. But I do have interesting photos. They came together in stolen cars. They are quite vivid. Three dead bodies, all young folks in the prime of life, just like you beaten to death. Pools of blood. Your girlfriend did it. Bull shit! I don't believe it! Really? Okay, then. I mean, I don't have to, but fuck it. I will. Curious, does this wake you up even a little? Oh, yeah. I mean, it speaks for itself. And that's what I've been trying to tell you about. Hi! Time to get out! Keys, keys we need keys! Damit! It won't start. He's got the keys. Well, let's go. What's wrong?! He'll be back soon! You killed three guys? Yes, Kyle, but we can discuss this later, don't you think? Why are you so quiet? Did you ask me if I did it? Yes. Yes, I did. Say something. Maybe you're too scared to talk to a crazy girl. Is your opinion. Changed? You think I'm nuts? Say something! I don't know what to say. Then I'll tell you. Our rabbi loved to say. Better to believe your enemies Don't believe your friends. I believe you, Lilith. But you confessed to all these killings. I saw the photos. There's no explanation. Then why did you follow me? Yeh! Just stay with the cops and go straight to jail. No, thanks! I don't quite want to lose my freedom! You can lose something more valuable. Your life for instance, have you thought about that? You won't kill me. I don't know what happened to you but you are not a bad person. Really? You know me. Only for a few days. That's enough for me to know who you really are. We met at one house party. He got on top of me in the pool. We started dating next day I called him first. He was so gallant and courteous from a good family. It happened when we went camping with his friends. America's Got Talent! Such a gifted girl, and such a loud one! She was moaning quite professionally. We're fucking got jealous around here. Yeah. Did you know she was a Jew? I mean, did you see the medallion around her neck? It's a fuking Magen David, bro! Come on, Bill. I found out yesterday. Okay? Yeah, she's a Jew, so what? She doesn't look like them anyways. Our older brothers won't forgive you for this. You're basically fucked. They don't need to know. That's it for us anyways. You should share. She doesn't know anything. All right? Yes she moans so what?! She won't even blow you a disappointment. Then we'll teach her. No, seriously, don't. Then get out of our way. Go for a swim or something. Are you fucking protecting the Jew? No, but don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Okay? Trust me, she's not as stupid as she seems. She knew. Knew well enough not go in with three guys if she wasn't into it. She's a fucking Jew. It's never straight with them. You know this. Right. The more dicks it wants, the better. We'll teach that jew girl how to blow and some other stuff. She'll be grateful for you afterwards. Seriously, dude, you won't be able to get rid of her. You can talk. What's mine is yours. I'll go for a swim. So, how did it go? You took your time swimming. We went in twice each yeah. Your bitch has a sweet ass. Didn't hurt her, right? No, dude, chill. Cutie ass is still fine. Still kosher. She's tired. I'm sure she's sleeping. It's a hard worker, you know, Cooling her cylinders. Yeah. Scared me. We good? What the fuck? Fuck you bitch! What the fuck?! Oh my God. Hey! Stay down fucking bitch! Fucking stay down! I'm on my own now. Why? Why are you leaving me? I wana come with you. No. You just can't gofarther. You're a good man and I won't forget you. Wait another girl in your life. But you're my girlfriend! We meet again? Of course. Not for a while. Bye Kyle. I've been a rabbi for over 40 years. And now I know for sure miracles exist. I am not surprised that she came back. All that people you were telling me about, they described her soul as if all of them had an appearance in accordance with their own inner world. You say her name was Lilith. You know. No, no, that was not her name. Liza Jenkins was her real name. She died a long time ago. 25 years. Liza drowned. And now she had some kind of reason to come back. She came out of the water and went back into it. After she'd done what she came for. She called herself Lilith because that is the name of a demon, and she needed to be it for some of us, at least that's how I see the explanation. You could think whatever you want. A coincidence, a big mystification. But there are no other explanations, such as reincarnation of karmic spirals. But I am too old to discredit miracles. That's all I have left to believe. The one for whom the miracle was performed doesn't recognize the miracle that was performed for him.
