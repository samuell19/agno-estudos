[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [ALARM RINGING] [ROCK MUSIC] - [RADIO HOST] Good morning, Southern Alberta. Rise and shine. Make sure you bundle up on the way to work today. She's a bluebird Alberta morning thanks to that Chinook that rolled in. Here's one to wake you up, from The Dudes, it's “Rocky Mountain Living”. [PHONE ALARM RINGING] - Come on, time to get up. Come on! I'm going to get coffee, and you're not getting any. - Are you going to have a good breakfast? Okay, guys, have a great day. - Okay, you too. - Love you. - Bye, love you. - [RADIO] We have a few really fun community announcements today. Wes and Donna Lewis are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary this Saturday. Friends and family are invited to celebrate with them at the high school gymnasium. All of us here at the station would like to congratulate and wish Wes and Donna all the best and many more years together in the future. - We get all the tools there? - I think so, dude. It was just these, I think. - I'll tell you, man, this year has been brutal. So glad that sun, sand, and cold beers await. I've been counting down to tropical time since November. It just never seems to change. The cold always goes right through my bones. - I want to take George to the coast. We're going to do a bit of fishing. I'll tell you, that halibut and salmon look amazing. I'm really looking forward to fighting some of those fat bastards with my boy. - I don't know why on Earth anyone would want to fight anything on their vacation. I mean, we fight the weather, we fight rusted bolts, we fight the clock. You seriously need to learn to kick back and relax, Nige. - It's in my blood, I guess. I love a good fucking challenge, man. Man against the ocean, man against nature. [PHONE BUZZING] - That's Artie. I hate it when that damn thing rings at the end of the day. - Rather yours than mine. I wonder what he wants? I hope it's nothing pressing. Well, I know I'm done for the day. Ain't nothing keeping me from the Flames game tonight, man. Playoff race is on and the boys are on fire. Nope. Not happening. Emily would kill me if I bailed on her. Hello, Art. What do you need? - [ARTIE] Hey, you guys get 2118 done today? If so, I'm impressed, as always. - Yeah, Artie. 2118's at 85% and back online. She put up a fight, but the boys got her built. - Excellent. Always good to hear. Hey, listen, I know it's Friday and all, but I got a call from corporate today. I'm going to need you guys to come in when you finish up in the field. - Everything alright, Artie? - Uhh... This isn't really phone stuff. I just need you guys to come in. It'll only take a minute. - This better not be one of those bullshit random drug tests, because I swear to God, I got a medical card and you guys-- - No. Wait... - Anyways, it's not a spot piss test. I really can't do this right over the phone. Just head back, okay? - Yeah, Art. We're all done for the day. Let's keep it brief. Headed to the dome tonight. - 10-4 on that. See you when you get here. - On our way, Art. - What in the sweaty fuck do you think that's about? I can't think of anything we botched in the field lately. - I'm with you, man. Nothing's gone tits up for ages. I'll bet you someone saw you speeding through a fucking school zone in the company truck. - One time. It happened one time and the sign was laying in the ditch. Could have happened to any of us. I hope you're right, man. If I see a piss truck in front of that office when I get there, I'm going to piss on his tires on the way in. They can wait for a fresh batch. Which reminds me, I think I need to grab some orange juice on the way back to the office. - Yeah, alright. I'll see you there, bud. - See you, man. [TWANGY GUITAR] - Dude, you should have seen it. I got Claire at the grocery store so good. - Dude, I'm not being funny, but I've got things on my mind. I'm fucking worried about this. Art's never this cryptic. - Well, the good news is we're going to get the low down real quick, man. Relax. We got nothing to hide. - Yeah, you're probably right. It's probably nothing. Nothing to hide. - I just hope you're wrong about that speeding in rural school zones. If I get demoted again, Emily's going to kill me. - Yeah, I wouldn't fucking blame her. [LAUGHTER] [TWANGY GUITAR] [KEYBOARD TYPING] - Is that Dale and Nigel? - No, it's the government. You're late on your carbon taxes. We're here to bust your kneecaps. - Hey, guys. I know this is out of the ordinary. Grab a seat. All right, I'm just going to come out with it. Corporate needs cuts. I've been fighting them tooth and nail for a month now, but I've got to let some guys go. I mean, if I say no one more time, they're just going to bounce my ass out and put some 25 year old yes-man idiot in charge. - So what you're saying is it's not a piss test. - Dale... You make me think sometimes it should be. But it's not. - So wait, what? Is it us? - Yeah. I can't let Ed or Willie go. They've been here 15 years. I just let Nathan in the back shop go this morning. Now I have to run the office and the shop. This is the stupid shit that only makes sense in boardrooms full of suits and degrees. You won't be out for long. You guys know how this works. Corporate gets jittery, [LAPTOP CLOSES] pulls the trigger early, and then regrets it. A couple of months later, they hire you back for more money. It's classic oil field 101, right? So take those forms and get them filled out as soon as possible. Guarantee we'll get you back to work before summer. It's the oil patch. What's Willie's line? “It's as up and down as a whore's nightgown.” - That's some classic Willie right there. - Well, thanks for letting us know, Art. I'll keep in touch for sure. You're a real straight shooter. Yeah, Art. Don't look so glum. You just gave us paid vacations. I know I'm going to tear it up. Just give me 30 days notice when you need me, okay? - I'm sorry, though, guys. - I'll keep in touch. You know where I am if you need a guy. - Yeah, will do. Will do. Now, don't go spending all your money at once, you know, just in case. - [DALE] What're you looking at me for again? - Can you believe it? They let us go, man. What are we going to do now? This could get bad, Dale. - It could, but it ain't going to. Relax, man. Take your boy out to the coast, go slay some of those salmon, and bam! We'll be right back here loading up those work trucks and heading back out to the field in no time. It's all going to work out, man. - Yeah, it'd break his heart if I cancelled. [PENSIVE MUSIC] [DOOR SLAMS] - So nice to finally be home. - Hey, you are running a bit late. You better hurry up and get some of this dinner in you. We've got to go in 10 minutes or so. Battle of Alberta tonight. It is going to be a total zoo in there, though. - Yeah. Sorry, babe. Artie called us into the office today. - Yeah? What'd Arthur want? I told you that medical card was bullshit, Dale. - It wasn't that. But that's totally what I was thinking as well. - So what was up then? - Well, it wasn't all bad. Basically. Artie gave us the rest of the spring off, which is great because now we can spend more time in Jamaica. - What do you mean? He gave you the rest of the spring off? I don't get it. - Well. He let me and Nigel go today, but he did promise to hire us back in three months. It's just this little bitty dip in the price of oil gets the suits downtown nervous, makes 'em make stupid decisions. All I got to do is fill these forms out, get E.I. for three months and bam, I'll be right back out in the field. Nothing to worry about. - I mean, yeah, it just kind of sounds, you know, too good to be true. - Yeah, babe, it's all going to be great. We get more time together like you keep asking for. We can put more effort into making that baby that you want so bad. - Okay, that part does sound great. Oh, and maybe you could start finishing some of the projects that you've started around here. - Whatever keeps my beautiful, smart, sexy little princess happy. - You smooth talking son of a bitch. How about you just worry about getting that plate in you and leave the pillow talk for later? If Gaudreau scores one more time before we make it to our seats, I am so going to beat your ass, mister. - I might not know who's going to win the game tonight, but I know who's going to score. [GIGGLING] [KISSING] - Asshole... - I didn't see it coming. I mean, we turn up in the morning, we get our worksheets for the day, and then come the end of the day, he's giving us our pink slips and we're fucked off for three months. Hey, lovely. Could you fix us another one, please. - Sure, Nige. [AMBIENT BAR NOISE] - Thanks, babe. - Sorry, I was eavesdropping. Did you lose your job today? - Well, yes, I did, Kate. Eh, it's all good. It's all good. These hands will keep me busy. You know, a strong mind and a strong back keeps a man whole and fulfilled. You can tell the queen I said that. - Oh, I'll have to write this down. I'm going to have a lot to tell her when I see her next. - Absolutely. She loves hearing from her cowboys out here in the royal majestic edge of her empire. [LAUGHING] - Nigel. What would we do without you out here to show us Her Majesty's way? - I'm not sure, but I'm sure it wouldn't be as distinguished. Well, let's put it this way. I mean, the Rocky Mountains wouldn't be as majestic without Her Majesty's approval, would they? - True. - Well, Nige, If you're not busy next week, I have few jobs that are lagging behind. I could use your help. I've had pretty good results with vets in the past. What branch of military were you again? - You see, my lady? Ask and the universe shall provide. I totally swallowed the Queen's shilling. I was an infantryman. Yeah, sure, Jed. I'd love to work with you, mate. What do you got in mind? - Well, that all depends. What tools are you familiar with? - Oh, I don't know. Pretty much anything with tires or a trigger. - How does Tuesday work for you? I've got a fence job out of town that I need to get to. I can pay you 25 an hour. It should be a four day job. But you'll be working with me. Can you be on site for 830? - Sounds perfect, man. I love working out of town. - Sweet, man. Do a good job, Nige, and I promise I'll keep you busy for the next three months. I'm so backed up, I'm scared I'm going to lose some jobs before I even get to them. - You can count on me, mate. And, it sounds like a refreshing change of pace for me. Cheers. [GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC] [GROANING] [SMOOCH] [BLENDER WHIRRING] - Fucking snow. [PHONE RINGING] - What's going on, Nige? Why are you calling me so early? - I'm not calling you early. It's 9:30 in the bloody morning. Are you still in bed? - No, I'm not still in bed. I've been up for awhile now. Hmm. Hey, did you see the thing on the news this morning? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get yourself sorted out and I'll meet you at Marv's. I've been up for ages. I've already had a smoothie, I went for a run. I'm bored out of my freaking mind. [COUGHING] I'll meet you wherever, bud. As long as you're buying. - That sounds like a plan to me. I'll pick up the breakfast tab. You pick up the bar tab tonight. - Bar tab? We're going out tonight? What's the occasion? I mean, I don't even know what to wear. - You daft wanker. Are you telling me you've forgotten your best friend Nigel's birthday today? Honestly, Dale, sometimes I wonder if you really are this mindless or it's just an act. - Well, for one, we used to work together. And, of course, I remembered your birthday. I mean, how can I forget? It's going to be a wonderful night celebrating the birth of our favorite English cowboy. Everybody's going to be there. - Yeah, right. Buttering me up. Now I know you forgot. - Oh, hey, you know what? I bet I can talk Em into bringing some of the nurses out from the hospital. They're always up for a good night out. - You see, I knew you forgot. I bet you're writing another one of your bloody lists, aren't you? I'm so glad that we do not play hockey on my side of the pond. I wonder what you'd be like if the best part of your head hadn't been smashed out by playing that violent game. - Whatever. I'd do it all over again If I meant I'd find Em again. I mean, I might be a little forgetful, but it was all worth it. - Just get showered and get your ass there, alright? I'll see you there. [PHONE BUZZING] - Hey. Oh my god, You know you're not supposed to call me at work except for emergencies. - Hey, wait. It is an emergency. [SIGHS] It's Nigel's birthday today, and I forgot, Em. Do you think you can sweet talk any of the nurses you work with into coming out for a few drinks tonight at the bar for his birthday? - You know what? Yes. Just because you asked so nicely, I can definitely pull together some of my nursing girls. Okay, babe. I've really got to go back to work. Oh, you lucky guy, you. Staying in bed this morning. Oh, I wanted to cuddle with the cat this morning. Okay. I love you. - Love you more. Have a great day. - I'll talk to you later. Bye, babe. - Damn. Good old Dale Walters, comes through again. This kid is a wagon, folks. Never count out the kid from Vermillion with the million dollar smile. [UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC] [EGGS SIZZLING] [DISHES CLANKING] - There's our legendary foreign war hero. Happy birthday, Nigel Loggins. - Good morning, Dale. Here's a coffee and a menu. Top off, Nigel? - Yeah, I might as well while you're here. Please, darling. And I think I'm just going to have a breakfast special. - Okay. - Same for me, thanks. - Two breakfast specials coming right up. Holler if you need me. - Thanks, man. I tell you, it's been a really good day so far. I haven't been for a morning run since I was in the service. When we get back out in the field that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go for a run every morning instead of after work. - You can do whatever you want before work. Just don't be calling me to join some crack of dawn jogging club. - Dude, I really think you should be doing something. I'm looking at that shirt. It's only been two weeks since we've been laid off, and that's kind of getting a little bit tight, you know? - Absolutely. Through the chest and shoulders, because I finally have time to hit the gym with all the spare time we have nowadays. - Come on, man, you can barely lift yourself out of bed, let alone lift any real weight. - Just touching up the beach bod for Jamaica, bud. - Did you book for a week or are you going for a month? I'll tell you, I'm fucking jealous, man. I'd love to get up and go for a jog on the beach or do a bit of yoga or maybe get some diving in. - Yup, that's a great way to screw up a perfectly good vacation. Em's the same way. Dale, get up. Dale, let's get going. Dale, we got to go check this out. Why can't you guys just have a beer, chill out, and relax? - Sorry, dude. One sec, I'm getting a text from my mum. - Oh, how is she doing? That woman is nothing like you, Nigel. She's definitely the life of the party. When are you bringing her back out here anyways? - She's good, man. Weather sucks, though. It's rainy season at the moment, which is pretty much every fucking season in England. I'm hoping to bring her back in summer, but really, it depends if Artie comes through on that plan. I'm hoping I can still afford to, man. But I've got a bone to pick with you. Ever since you and Em got her into trail riding, that's all I fucking hear from her. All the time. - That's all Em. I had nothing to do with that. I know she'd choose her horses over me. - There you go, guys. Need anything else? - No, I think we're good, thanks. - Okay, well, enjoy. - Thank you. - Thanks, dude. So, what time you going to make it to the Ironwood tonight, anyway? And no pussying out, you limey bastard. It's your birthday. We're staying past midnight. We are doing shots together tonight. Probably lots of them. - None of these fucking prairie... whatever they're called. Or brains in a bottle. Only decent shots of good whiskey or I'm out, dude. I'm serious. - We'll see what comes up in the moment. ♪ I got a green lawn chair from the Dollar store ♪ ♪ sitting out on my front porch ♪ ♪ last week's laundry's hanging on the line ♪ ♪ Might not be much, but it's what I got ♪ ♪ I'm high rollin' on the corner lot ♪ ♪ Welcome to my home sweet double wide ♪ [LAUGHTER] - Every stable needs a donkey.

I appreciate you putting this together, even if it was last minute. [DALE SCOFFS] - Don't worry about it. I'm just excited as you are. Go find your seat. I got a surprise for you. - Alright, cheers. - Look, I know the rules, but it's a special night. Just put one on the bar. - I don't know. - C'mon, it's Nige's birthday. Tell you what, put one on the bar and go ahead and put two on my tab if it makes you feel better about it. - Alright. - Who wants to play shooter girl for our beloved birthday boy? At his age, who knows how many more he's going to get? Hmm? - Well, I did say whiskey only, so he's got me there. - What are you getting up to? Jesus. So, this night's gonna go okay.

I don't know what the queen did to get your ass booted off the island, But I'm sure glad you made it out to the west here, to the New World, and eventually, of course, to Apex Oil. Gosh, what, five years ago now? - Yeah, five and a half years. Dealing with you crazy Albertans and your big fancy pickup trucks. - What's that I saw in your driveway, Nigel? Wasn't that a big fancy pickup truck of your own? [ALL] - Ooooooh! - You've got a point there. - Ed. Willie. You're up. - Hey, that's what I call a card. - You might be able to read that one, bud. - Yeah, with my old eyes, eh? - You need some glasses? - Best part of being over the hill... is not being under it.

You guys know I got your back, right? - Oh, yeah. - We know. - It's just a blip on the radar. The timing of these layoffs is always terrible. - It's all good. It's all good. I've got the utmost confidence in you. - You got my word. I'll get you guys back in as fast as I can. It's the Alberta way, right? -Yeah, we all know it. It's the Berta way, boys.

[KISSING] - Hey, babe. Are you just about packed? Remember, it's a one month trip. We are not moving there. - How about you just shut your face hole out there? I'm not the one that always has to tell the Border Guard: "Oh, no, sir." "I did not, in fact, pack my own bag." "My wife did it for me because I'm still a child." [LAUGHTER] - Well, you didn't like anything I picked out to wear anyway. So, it's really a win win for me. Less stuff for me to do. And I don't have to hear how much you don't like my shirt or something. Babe, have you seen the travel insurance? - Yeah, I believe it's in my bag with your passport, and your balls. Did you bother to check for either of those? - Oh, sweet. Just don't get kicked in the bag, okay?. That'd really hurt. - Okay, let me fix all of this. Why did you pull all of this apart anyway? How about you go do something productive and take the luggage to the truck? - Yeah, babe. No woman, no cry. We be headed to Jamaica. Smoke the good ganja, and... Holy fuck! Which ones are we taking? - How about all of them, genius? - Yeah. This isn't so bad. For a second there I thought you were totally going to overdo it again. - You can't possibly be serious. You know it's still February, right? - Dress for where we going, not where you are, right? That's a thing, isn't it? - Oh, my god, Dale. - Oh, Em. Can you at least take one of these? - Fine. - This is going to be the best vacation ever. Who knows? Maybe two cultures go to Jamaica and three come back. - Okay. Come on, let's get going. Get that sexy ass right out this door. I'm so not missing our flight. - Oh, no. Hey, babe, can you carry me? I want to have snow in my sandals again. - I just need some of my things. - I said no. Go away. - I just need to get some tools from the shed. If you're mad, just come outside so we don't have to-- - I don't have time for your shit. You still owe me money. - You know, I would have already been gone if you'd just let me do this. You know, I'm trying to take care of you and the boys and make money, right? - Fuck off. [DOOR SLAMS] [DEADBOLT LOCKS] - Not in front of the boys, Jed. Man up. [SOMBER GUITAR MUSIC] [DEEP SIGH] - [RADIO] Still more bad news for the oil and gas sector in southern Alberta. Six more companies have closed their doors this month, adding to mounting problems. With the orphaned and abandoned well count climbing, The Premiere has stated that the fund for managing these wells has run out and will add to the deficit. [BRIDS CHIRPING] - Morning. - Morning. How are you? - I'm good, man. We ready to do this? - Yeah. Are you? - Yes, man. - All right, let's go do some fencing! [LAUGHING] - Yeah! [SOMBER FOLK MUSIC] [FENCEPOST RATTLING] Well, Nige, I got to say, you're the best hand anybody could ask for. Hell, even in my best year, of running ten guys and using 300 grand in equipment, I barely made 100 for myself. You know how it is, right? We'll be set to work the next day and all of a sudden the phone rings, one of the guys can't make it in. Then where does that leave me? - I know what you mean, dude. I was so glad when I got paired up with Dale after dealing with my share of flakes. - You know, the fact is, I work so much. Christine's leaving me, and she's made it so difficult. I can't even see my boys. - Fuck, really? I had no idea, dude. Listen, If you need anything... - I'm a big boy, Nige. I don't need handouts. - Well, listen, it's not a handout, dude. It's a friendly offer. I know how bad it can get. I was in the courts fighting for years to fucking get to see my own son. I know what it's like. - Listen, man. You're a good dude. But I'll figure it out. We may have to let some guys go or sell some equipment. Even cash in the life insurance. But I'll make sure that my boys are taken care of. And even that bitch that's raising them. - Life insurance. You got that, eh? If I had life insurance, Mona would have had me have a fucking convenient accident. [CHUCKLING] - Convenient accident... I've never heard it put that way before. [SOMBER FOLK MUSIC] [WHISPEING] - Take your hat off. - Mr. and Mrs. Walters. Hi. - So, how did the lab results come back? I've been probably doing too much reading at work. I'm a little concerned about if I'm working out too intensely or all the caffeine intake, you know, just shift work. - Mrs. Walters. Let me put your mind at ease. All your lab work is great. Any initial concerns that we had for endometriosis turned out to be disproven by the exam and any evidence of autoimmune disorders that would trigger a termination, just not there. So as far as the coffee and the shift work goes, not optimal. But as far as I can tell from the results, I don't think there's a drastic change needed. Just monitor it for your own health risks. - Okay. - That's good. - So it's just more of a matter of time for us then? - I don't see any major issues, honestly. But I am concerned about the results from the questionnaire from from Dale's lab reports. I don't know if there's any physical reasons contributing to the low sperm levels. So I looped back to the questionnaire and says here that you quit smoking about four months ago. That's good. Are you winning the battle? - Oh, absolutely. Still leading the charge against lung darts, Doc. - Good. Well, we'll start seeing hopefully increased O2 levels there. Perhaps it's just lagging right now. - I don't know if I'd want any more oxygen in my blood. Wouldn't that leave less room for alcohol? - Well, that does lead to my concern, Mr. Walters. It seems that I would say that alcohol and stress could possibly be related to the lower sperm counts. And as far as I can see, you're a healthy male with no other reasons to be below the mid level range. Are you under any increased stress currently? - No, I'd say I'm less stressed than usual. Actually, Doc, I haven't had to get up and go to work at the crack of dawn and slave way with my nuts in a snowbank at -40. Now, if I could just get this little angel to lighten up, well, I'd be on easy street. - You think this is funny? Seriously? I've been researching everything I possibly can just to see if there's anything remotely causing problems here. You're just going to brush off what the doctor has to say? - Didn't realize this was such a big deal. - Let me just jump in here, if I may. There is no doubt in my mind that you're going to be successful here, Mrs. Walters. Emily, if I may. Your background in nursing and your great health, I'm sure there's no issues here. And as far as you, Mr. Walters, I don't think it's physical. I think it's situational. I believe that if you maybe do some exercising a little bit more, get good rest at night. Get to bed at a decent hour. Maybe just relax. If we don't see any changes in the next, say, three months or so, why don't you make another appointment here and we'll start monitoring at that time. How's that sound, okay? - It's good. Thank you. - Yeah. Thanks, doc. Appreciate it. That's good news, isn't it? - Yeah. - Okay. - Everything is a joke from you. You lost your job. Great. You got a low sperm count. Now we get to practice more. Yay me. Come on. You think maybe now that the doctor's also telling you you're drinking too much, you might consider slowing down? [DEEP SIGH] - Em... I'm sorry. You're right. I should have been paying more attention to what the doctor was saying. Listen to me. You know you mean the world to me. And you know I want this baby just every little bit as much as you do. I just got nervous and felt shame when you're talking about low sperm count and then you and the doctor talk about things that I don't understand, and it made me feel dumb. So I just tried to lighten it up a bit. I'm sorry. I promise I won't do it again. - Look, I need you. We need to start thinking about more than just ourselves here. Okay? So just don't screw this up. Smarten up before I got to kick your ass. - Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I deserve that. I guess I just never fully thought about all the changes and responsibilities are going to come with having a child. I guess I'm just terrified of things changing between us so much. I love you with all my heart. I'm just... so confused lately. Since I lost my job my mind seems to be going in a million different directions. [DEEP SIGH] - I'm gonna see Pastor Frank. Yeah... He always knows how to put my mind at ease. It's been too long, anyway. - I love you. - I love you too, babe. I'm sorry. - It's okay. Okay. Let's drive home. [ENGINE STARTING] - Hello Christine. Before you start yelling, or hang up, just listen to me for a second. It's been four months since I've seen the boys. I'd really like to take them out to dinner, or maybe take them to the park. They need their dad. This is really ridiculous. I'm getting tired of it. - Well, I don't think you will be seeing your boys anytime soon. And I just sold your business. - You did what? - We are out of money, Jed. What did you expect me to do? - Without a company, how do you expect me to make money for you and the boys? You know, I know you don't care about me and that's fine. You just got to focus on taking care of Will and Pat. - You have backed me into a corner here. - What's done is done. - I had no other option. - You make a mess, and once again I'll take care of it for you. For christ's sake. Bye. - And you know what? I've had enough. [CALL ENDS] [KNOCKING] - Dale, come in. Good to see ya. Been awhile. - Yeah, it has, hasn't it? Sorry about that. - Please, sit down. You want a coffee? - Oh, you're too kind, Frank. I don't need to put you out any. - Oh, it's no trouble at all. I'll go turn the pot on. We can take our time. - Okay. - So really, it just feels like, to me, that everybody's either ignoring me or judging me lately. I mean, it's like everybody can't wait for me to slip up and say or do something so they can swoop in and attack. Even Emily, you know, and I love that one with all my heart, Frank. But it's like all she does nowadays is try to find new and exciting ways to make me feel like an idiot lately. - Dale, it's just the growth stages of a marriage. The shine comes off all that are new. It's frightening. Happened to me, too. I've known you and Emily for quite a while now, and I see a strong bond. I think if you just close your eyes and take a deep breath, you'll find that closeness again. - Yeah. I couldn't stay mad at that woman. Not even if I tried. I mean, let's face it, I'm pretty lucky to have her. [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] It's just... lately, there's just been this annoying voice that keeps telling me that I'm not worth it. Then this really gross feeling in my stomach that just tells me I'm just going to screw up and chase her away. I don't know where all this doubt is coming from. I mean, I'd run into a burning barn naked, covered in cooking oil for that woman. I just need to get back to work. And get all this nonsense off my mind. - Dale, we all feel that way. That's the mud we all trudge through. A constant battle between confidence and doubt. That's why faith in God is so important. Have you been praying? - I'm praying to go back to work. - Well, that's a good start. You think there's anything else that's been holding you back? You seemed to be having a pretty good time at Nigel's birthday. - Here we go with the judgment again. - Dale, I'm not trying to judge you. I'm just trying to guide you as a friend. - Well... I wouldn't say I'm an alcoholic. I just get bored sitting around the ranch. And... this nothingness... this void. I mean, there's nothing to do and there's nothing I can do. I'm just sitting in this God awful limbo waiting for other people to do things so I can get back to work and have a life again. And I have no idea how to explain that to Emily. I have no idea how to tell her that. You know, and we're trying to save money. So it's not like I can go out and do much. So I feel trapped and there's this nothingness. Next thing I know, I got a beer in hand, and there's six empties on the floor. - The devil does dance in empty pockets, and idle minds are his playground. Is there anything you've been putting off that you can start chipping away at? Even the smallest thing can help with the boredom. - Well, you know how it is. There's always something to do around the ranch. Yeah. Hey, thanks for your time, Frank. You've definitely give me some good stuff to think about again. Some stuff that I forgot, for sure. But, you know, I've been talking to Artie lately, and it sounds like things are picking back up out at work, so I should probably lace ‘em up and get a few warm-up laps in before it's game time again and I'm caught off guard, right? - Well, that's the optimistic Dale that we all know and love. You're going to be all right. You got lots of friends that have your back. I'm always here for you. You know what you got to do. Now get to it. - Hey, Frank, I don't know if you do this or not, but Emily and I've really been struggling to have a baby lately. Any chance you think you can ask the big guy to maybe lend us a hand, please? - No problem at all. God rejoices in new beginnings. Of course I'll say a prayer for you and Emily to have a child. - Thanks a lot, Frank. I really appreciate it. I'll see you Sunday. - You bet. [LIGHT GUITAR MUSIC] - [RADIO] As unemployment hits a 30 year high, thousands are protesting new government taxes and regulations that continue to chase investments out of the province. [LIGHT GUITAR MUSIC] [WOOD TUMBLING] - Artie, it' Dale. How you been, man? - Hey, Dale. Not too bad. How're you keeping? - Oh, you know. Swamped with the honeydew list. Hey, did you get that email I sent you? Talked it up like I got numerous offers coming in. - Oh, yeah, Yeah, I passed that on. Hey, hey, listen, a hiring freeze is still in effect, alright? So it's going to be a while longer. But, uh, your email helped. I think it'll help get skilled guys like yourself hired back before farmed out green hardhats. - Oh, uh. I guess that's good news. Still got lots of E.I., still got lots of stuff to get caught up--. - Sounds good, Dale. Go get ‘em, tiger. [ARTIE'S VOICE ECHOES] [CAR APPROACHING] - There's my big sexy. Did you call Arthur today? When're you headed back out to work? - There's the sweetest girl in the whole wide world. Yeah, I talked to Artie today. Shouldn't be much longer. Said he's making good headway with corporate. And that the email you wrote made a huge difference. Shouldn't be more than another three months tops. Which is good because I forgot how much stuff there is to do around here. - Yeah, I mean, that's great, because what you're really saying is that I can add to the honeydew list because when there's time, you know how much I'd reallyl love that reclaimed table you promised me? - Hell yeah, Em. It's going to look awesome in the living room. Great idea. - Yeah, you think you can get a full table built before you get drunk and chop off an entire bag of fingers? - Am I detecting some jealousy? - Yeah, a lot of it. You wake up late every morning, you start drinking early. Come on, Dale. I'm getting so sick of this. I've got to get up and go to work every single morning while you're out here living it up. Did you save any beer for me? - Oh, shit. We may have to turn back around and hit the liquor store. Oh, and if I call the pizza place we could hit both while we're in town. - Of course we're out of beer. And you forgot to plan dinner. Big surprise. - It was a busy day. I had tons of stuff to do. Jesus. Whatever. I'm so sick of your drunk shit. Let's just fucking go.

Sorry, we shouldn't have put that there. - Sorry. It's just... - It's okay. I'll put it back together. Don't worry about it. Just try not to knock anything else over. Dale, are you sure you're okay? Just take a breath. It's okay. It happens all the time. Don't worry about it. I thought you were just kidding around. [DOWNBEAT BLUES MUSIC] - [RADIO] Protests continue outside the legislature as hundreds of thousands of unemployed Albertans grow furious. - Hey, hey, seriously? What is this? - Come on. You know how this week has been. - No. It's not even done. - I am trying. - No, no, no. You just need to go home. - Fine. - Just go. - Whatever. - Looks like you've had one of those shifts. - More like one of those weeks. I didn't even have time to eat my lunch today. I gotta go. And apparently Jean thinks I should too. - Well, you should let some of us girls take some of the shifts. You're working yourself to death here. - Yeah, I would love to, but unfortunately, I need to pick up as many shifts as I can right now. Everything's on me. - Well, how about I come over? We can have a girls night, bring over our favorite bottle of wine. Relax. - Wine. Okay. My house. Hot tub. - Okay. Love you. - I will call you. - Okay, sounds good. Have a good night. - Yes. Good luck. - Bye. [OUT OF TUNE GUITAR PLUCKING] [ANGRY BLUES MUSIC] [DOOR SLAMS] - Of course. There you are on the couch. You know what? This shit is getting really fucking old fast, Dale. Come on, Come on. It's been a year of this shir. Did you, I don't know, at least make dinner today, Dale? Or is that my job just like apparently everything else is around here these days. - Jesus Christ. Get off my case. - Your horses don't feed themselves on their own, and the holes they kick and chew through the fences don't mend themselves on their own either. - Seriously? You know what? Fuck this, Dale! [GUITAR SMASHES] I'm so done with your shit. It takes five fucking minutes to feed the horses. And the hole? The hole was last fucking week, Dale. And you know what? Your E.I.? Your E.I.'s half of what we need to cover the bills around here, don't you know that? - You don't think I know that? Fuck this, I'm going to the shop. - I'm sorry. I will buy you a new guitar. I'm sorry for exploding on you. I just had a really long day at work today, Dale. I'm trying so hard to be strong for both of us. Can you just sit down and have dinner? Just talk to me, please. [EMILY CRYING] - You know, it's the weirdest thing. I've been trying to get ahold of Jed for days, and he keeps on going to voicemail. It's like he's fallen off the face of the earth or something. It's not like him at all. - You didn't hear? - Didn't hear what? - Uh, Nigel... Jed was working on some electrical stuff out at a building by himself and the property owner hadn't heard from him for a while. Nobody had heard anything, so they went to check on him. They found his truck at the front of the building. But no Jed. So they went calling for him and... - You're telling me Jed had an accident? - Yeah. [CRYING] They found a pair of old metal pliers with him. They think that's what he was using to work when the power came on somehow. And he got electrocuted. - So Jed had a convenient accident. - Convenient? What's so convenient about getting electrocuted? - No, no, wait. That's not what I meant. It's a poor choice of words. How's his wife and kids? Do you know them? - They were going through a separation. You know, Jed, he didn't tell anyone anything. Nobody knew. But I think that's why he was using old shitty tools to finish the work. So that he could make due and go get his tools back. Turns out they were fighting about money because his company wasn't doing well at all. - Yeah, yeah, I know, I heard, But.. I still can't believe it. So Jed got himself electrocuted. Fuck me... [HOT TUB HUMMING] - Yeah, I don't know. I've just never seen him like this before. It's like he's lost in a fog. Every time I try to talk to him, about anything, he just drifts away deeper and I lose him again. Oh. And if he doesn't drift away deeper, he gets so angry about everything. - Mm. Really? - Yeah. And honestly, it just keeps getting worse and worse. I mean, I know he's trying, and I understand that it's hard to find a job right now, but I don't know. - I don't know. I'd probably leave him. I don't put up with that. - Well, I'm not going to do that. I mean, I still love him so much. It's just... I don't know. I wish that there was some way for me to help him get back to how he was before, you know? We used to have so much fun together and we used to have the most amazing sex all the time. Now it's just, I don't know, mechanical. It's like he's just kind of going through the motions. Doesn't even get me turned on anymore. - Really? You get turned on? - Jesus Tamara. Are you listening to a word I'm saying? I'm going through hell right now. - So sorry. One second. Setting this and. Okay. What were you saying? - This is exactly what I get from Dale. Oh, God. Emily wants to talk? Better run away to the shop and crack a beer. Just get drunk and sleep out here tonight. - He does that? Like, sleeps out in the shop? - Yup. And it totally freaks me out. I wake up in the house in the middle of the night, I'm all alone, and I've got no idea where he is. It's... like I can't. I don't know. He's just... not in a good place since he lost his job. I'm really starting to worry about him. I don't know, I just wish I could get him back. - I dunno, my moron of a brother is going back to work soon. He was out for a really long time. Maybe Dale will be going out soon. - Really? Trevor? He's headed back out? Maybe things will get better soon. I hope. I mean, I know all Dale really needs is to... feel like he's got a purpose, you know?. [HOT TUB BUBBLING] - Here's your coffee. - Thank you. - No problem. Enjoy. - Fuck me... I can't believe I said that. Dale, I had a fucking hand in this. I never would have said what I said if I thought he was seriously considering topping himself. I thought it was a fucking joke. - Can't beat yourself up, man. It's tragic. We all live and die by our own decisions. Poor bastard found a loophole. What are you going to do? Just another schmuck down the drain these days. No one even seems to care anymore. - Yeah, I'll get over it. But it's going to take some time. I just need to find some more work under the table, take the mind off it. Maybe I'll swing by and see his wife and kids. See if they're doing okay. I just got to keep myself busy, man. If you find any work, let me know. Up to my ass in bills. Sold everything that I can. Can't even think of losing the ranch. It's Em's dream to leave it to our future kids. If I could even get that right, It's all she ever even talks about anymore. - Is it that bad? I mean, I've got some saved if that can help you out. - No. No way, man. I can't take your money. My dad always says that's how losers are made. - It's going to get better, bud. It has to. - Yeah. For who? - Dale. Believe me, I have been through and seen worse shit than this. You've got to fucking trust me. We're going to get through this, man. - I can't see it, dude. The hardest part is, I don't know how to tell Em how fucked we are. Even my check engine light's been on for a month. I don't even know if I'm gonna get home. I don't even know if that's a bad thing anymore. - This is as bad as it's going to get. It's going to get better. You've got to believe that, dude. You've got to. Dude, just do me a favor. Try to keep your fucking chin up, alright? - Yeah, man. - Love you, bro. -Yo! Hollywood! What, you don't recognize your own cousin? What's going on, man? Mister hard to get a hold of. - Hey, Jimmy. Didn't see you there. Keeping busy. What brings you down? - Well, I left you a few messages. Clearly, you didn't read them. Just coaching Ty in a hockey tournament this weekend, man. Damn, dude, you look like shit. What, you've been on a one week bender? You look like death at the bottom of a bottle. Ever think it's time to, you know, give up on that rockstar lifestyle of yours? - Just feeling a little down these days. Must just be a lingering cold. Hey, how's Ty coming along? I haven't seen you guys in... Jeez. How long? - Well, you were at my mom's a couple of months ago. Hey, you and Em still thinking of making that baby? - That's what I'm told. - Well, listen to me, Hollywood. I hope you've got some cheddar up there in the cupboard. My burn rate these days is something like ten grand per month per kid. But what can you do, man? I mean, you got to give them what they want. You can't break their little hearts. I call them 21st century brats. But what are you gonna do? - Yeah, yeah, I hear you. I think Em's trying to pick up some shifts at the hospital. I don't know. Oil patch is kind of slow... - Listen, man, I don't mean to be rude, but I gotta roll. Ty's on the ice in like 45 minutes and somebody's got to man the bench. I'll see you soon, right? - Yeah, man, I got stuff to do anyway. Hey, Jimmy, tell your mom I love her, okay? - Yeah, for sure, man. Hey, and listen, get some rest, alright? You look like shit, and I don't want Em to leave you because you finds out what kind of a loser you are, alright? Love you cousin, I'm out of here. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [OIL DRRICK HUMMING] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] [VOICEMAIL BEEPS] [VOICEMAIL MESSAGE] - Art, it's Nigel. Listen, I need to know, am I ever coming back to work? I've sent you emails, I've left you messages. Let me know what the fuck is going on. I need to know. Call me. [DRAMATIC SOMBER MUSIC] - I mean, I could take on a few more shifts at the hospital. This is only temporary, right? Things will get better. Dale, come on. Look, it's going to be okay. My parents helped us get caught up. They totally understand. You've got a lot of support. It'll be fine. We'll get through this. Dale. Come on, look at me. It'll be okay. - It just feels like this nightmare will never end. There's no work. We've run out of money. And now your parents know I'm a loser. - Dale, no one thinks you're a loser. It's just... It's just tough right now. Look, everyone knows it's tough out there right now. Things will get better. We're going to get through this. I know we can. - Okay, sweetie, I love you. Whatever you say. [VOMITING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] - Dale! - Dale! Come on, where are you? Dale, where are you? Dale? Dale, where are you? [SOMBER MUSIC] Dale? Where'd you go? [EMILY SCREAMS] [EMILY SOBBING] [SOBBING] What did you do? [EMILY SOBBING] - [RADIO] Yesterday, during a convention, Alberta's energy minister told the crowd that out of work, Albertan oil workers should seek jobs in British Columbia. Today, she's saying that her statement is being taken out of context. Many there interviewed say they aren't buying it. [ANGELIC MUSIC] [SOMBER MUSIC] - Thank you for gathering with us here today. Some have traveled to great lengths. Others have shuffled many of life's commitments around to be here. Sometimes in life, we are called upon short notice to see to unforeseen events. Sadly, this is one of those times. Tragically, Dale was taken from us far too soon. He was full of life. He loved to laugh. He was a hard worker. He always strived to keep us all in good spirits. A devoted husband to Emily, he came to see me several times for advice to help ensure that their love would be as strong as the day they first fell in love. Dale loved Emily with all his soul. These are troubled times. Dale was no weaker than any of the rest of us. He simply lost hope in a better day. But better days are always closer than we think. When the clouds have let loose over our heads and the thunder claps in our ears At these times... we must hold each other dear. We must all act as shepherds and keep an eye over our flock. We must keep our hearts from growing calluses from the wear and tear of the storm currently overhead. For soon it will be gone and the sun will shine with all its glory. May we all remember Dale for how he lived, who he was, and how he shared his love with us. May will never forget, truly, how carefree of a spirit he lived to be. Please bow your heads and join me in a moment of silence and reflection. [SOMBER MUSIC DROWNS OUT BACKGROUND] [UNINTELLIGABLE CONDOLANCES] [UNINTELLIGABLE CONDOLANCES] - I was gonna tell him he was gonna be a dad. If he'd just waited one more day... - I'm struggling to find the right words to say. Just please promise me you'll stay with your folks for a bit. You need that support. Honestly, this is the first time that I've been back here since... Since I found him. - I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm still in shock myself. If you need anything, anything at all. You got my number. You're not alone. I'm here. [EMILY CRYING] - Even his smell is fading. - It's going to be rough, but things will get better. I'm not far if you need me.

Hey, sorry it took me so long to get back to you. Corporate put me on my ass while they sorted out their financing. But, great news. I can hire you and Dale back. A little less money, no benefits to start, but it's better than nothing, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, I can't get ahold of Dale, though. Does he have a new number? - Dale's gone. His funeral was yesterday. He hung himself. - What? Our Dale? Oh, my God. I got to go, Art. I've got to go. [GUN UNLOADING] [PHONE RINGING] - [OPERATOR] Good morning. Community Crisis Hotline.
