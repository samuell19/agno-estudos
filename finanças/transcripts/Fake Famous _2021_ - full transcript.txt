'Cause I need people to feel this. I need people to feel what charisma and passion is like in real life. This ain't no act.

That's kind of been actually a big problem for me with Instagram is that I feel like I don't have a formula. It seems like nowadays that selfies are the most popular.

It does also seem to mean "not employed" or "person without sense of purpose." Whoo! I think the term "influencer" has... Generally has a negative connotation for whatever reason. People associate influencers with bloggers or models who aren't signed or things like that. It really is about presenting a lifestyle that people want to mimic. You're really trying to show people, "This is my life, and if you "want to be more like me, you should follow me." Influencer is really a rage. It could be anything from a micro-influencer who has, say, like, 5,000 followers to somebody with a million-plus. There's the style influencers, there's the fashion influencers, the lifestyle influencers, the home and interior design influencers, the wellness influencers, the health and fitness influencers.

What the hell did Nick do? I bought him 7,500 bots. So what exactly is a bot? Well, in short, it's an algorithm that pretends to be a real person on the Internet. These bots are created by hackers and programmers who write code that scour the web to steal countless random identities online by pilfering people's photos and names and bios. Then their code jumbles all the stuff up together to create millions of fake people who can be used to like, comment, and follow millions of real people on social media. USA! USA! USA! USA! You likely heard about these bots during recent elections, Brexit, and the rise of the alt-right, where social media was being used to drive division around the globe, all done with fake people sharing fake news. Your social media feed may have been part of Russia's interference in the election. The issue is how sophisticated computer bots distribute online content and articles that could help Trump and hurt Clinton. But they also serve a bigger role in a more mainstream deception by making people appear more popular than they really are. And they're not just used on social media. For a few dollars, you can buy fake bidders on your listings on eBay. You can pay for fake song downloads on music websites, fake sales of books, and fake reviews of movies. You can pick if your bots are male or female, American or Chinese, liberal or conservative. And right now, there are hundreds of millions of them blending in online, and most people can't tell them apart from you and me. ♪ ♪ I don't have real chocolates, so I'm gonna make some.

Further this way. ♪ ♪ So it's not necessarily only influencers doing it. I think it's like, the platform has created basically this one formula for how to use it. Turbulence! No! The damaging part to this whole influencer world is, most of the time, it's not real. You can fake instances where it looks like you live in a mansion when you live in, like, a studio apartment. Like, in one of your photos where she was at Sequoia National Park, there's, like, a fence beam there. But to the average user, I don't think they would pick up on that. Sometimes people even fake things without realizing it, like Liz. - I have faked it. - What do you mean? I moved to LA for two years, and no one knew. Liz is the face of the hugely popular I did, like, a year-and-a-half, two-year stint in Los Angeles and kept running the account.

So this is my Insta phone. - It's my bots and my... - Your burner phone. My... all these different things on it. So I have this app, and I can give you 25 followers right now. It might take a minute to get started, so while we're waiting, I'll show you how to do likes. So let's pick a photo. Let's do this one from May 5th. All right, I'm gonna click this. So there, I just purchased you 15 likes. So you're gonna get those likes coming in. Okay. I can also do comments. All I do is press a button, and it will just start auto-commenting. And it uses hacked accounts. It uses bots. - It uses everything. - Okay. And so that's essentially how that works. And it's not just influencers. Journalists, politicians, and even A-list celebrities all purchase bots. Why is there so little done to try and stop all this from happening? Money. Why wouldn't Instagram stop this? Because it inflates their numbers. If you think about what these companies monetize, it's engagement and user growth, and bots generate both of those. Everyone's trying to show that their Instagram strategy has great metrics. And so there's really no incentive for anyone to get rid of these bots. It starts at the top, Wall Street, where they invest so much money into these tech companies because the return on their investment is unlike any other opportunity on the entire planet. Exactly how big? Trillions and trillions of dollars big. As you can imagine, it's not really in the best interest of bankers to ask if the people on the platforms are real because the money surely is. Now, the tech companies, they love to gloat about how many active users they have so that the value of their companies continue to grow. So while places like Instagram and Twitter do a little policing of the bots, they largely turn a blind eye to their platforms being filled with so many fake accounts. ♪ ♪ Just ask this guy. He is a bot broker who can help make you famous for a price. Instagram used to be about 7% to 9% bots, but that number has, of course, risen. Some of the most famous people in the world have 50%, 60% bots on their page. It goes without saying that the people making, buying, and selling those fake accounts are also making a small fortune. One small vendor told us you can make around $3 million a month from a little bot farm. Some of the bigger bot dealers, they make about ten times that. This is big business. These larger companies would be valued at least... If I had to give it a figure, it'd be at least $10 million, $20 million, maybe more, because... All based on fake bots. Yes. And then there's the influencers. There's so much money in the social media ecosystem. It's insane. I'm working with some brands that put 100% of their advertising budget into social media. It is a real economy. I mean, we built an entire business around it. The influencer agency that Liz helped create sold for tens of millions of dollars. This is the big box of Lippie Pencils. I got a KitchenAid Artisan stand mixer from Best Buy. So how much can these people actually make? These influencers right now are hot shit. We offered, I think it was these two 16-year-old mega-Youtubers, like, $36,000 each to post a few frames on Snapchat. A majority of these influencers are anywhere between 18 and 25 years old. I've paid influencers $80,000 for one post and two tweets before. They're working with "Fortune" 500 companies. They are a distribution platform. They're a media company in and of themselves. Kim Kardashian charges as much as $500,000 for a single post on Instagram. I have been obsessed with the two-step elixir kit by Queen Pegasus. Yet in 2019, a research study sparked press that many celebrity accounts like Kim Kardashian's have tens of millions of fake bots. So with all that money sloshing around, it's really in no one's best interest to call bullshit on any of this. - Hi! - Hi! How are you? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - Yes. This is gonna be so much fun. - I'm so excited. - I know. I know. This is Kenzie from the casting call, who offered to come by and teach Dom the ropes. She has 15,000 real followers and is considered a micro-influencer. How'd you get into the whole influencing? Well, I just... I mean, kind of for modeling and acting stuff, but I was just like, I would much rather be an influencer than working at a restaurant, you know? Yeah, totally. Or, like, all these odd jobs that we kind of have to work. This is, like, the longest thing I own in LA. Oh, wait, no, this would be great. - This would be great. - Okay, cool. - Hopefully it still fits. - Let's take this... yes. That's perfect. Okay. The first look is old Hollywood glam. So this will be great. I always pick kind of a muse and a story line to follow, and then from there, we just can, like, bang out as many... Create it. Yeah. It's a lot of work keeping up with an audience. Traditional celebrities, they can just go on camera, do some interviews, post some shots, you know. They don't have to engage 24-7 with their audience the way that influencers are expected to. You know, some of, like, the top influencers, they're posting, like, three or four times a day. People just want to see your content and what you're creating all the time. But we're gonna get you up there, girl. - All right. - We gonna do it. - Okay, great. - We gonna do it. Yeah. I mean, we're not gonna wear all of these, - but we have options. - That's great. Kenzie and her crew of photographers, stylists, and makeup artists are using an entire mansion for today's photo shoot, which only cost us $613.20, which is not bad to pretend you live like this. Okay, and I have everything separated into the looks. That's good. This is look four. Look one. Look one, look one. Nice. This is perfect for the last, like, glam. I love this yellow room.

You're a copywriter, you're a content production team, you are building your own entity of sorts, and that takes a tremendous amount of smarts. I don't know; Is this...

Like, I don't need to do any more fake private jets. I don't need to do any of this. There's so much that goes into planning the fakeness and, like, portraying something that's not really there.

She's getting free beauty regimens now. I'm just so chill. Pun definitely intended. She's become a brand ambassador for a gym. She's booking commercials and has had more callbacks and auditions than ever before. So I got to the audition... Or it was the callback, and the woman comes out, and she goes... "Are you Dominique?" 'Cause they're French. And I'm like, "Yeah." She goes... "We are so excited to meet you." I was like, "Okay." Like, I've never been greeted at an audition that way. It's usually just like, "Write your name down." And then she goes... "By the way, the photographer loves your Instagram." I was like, "Oh. Okay." I just went in, and I took some photos, and it was fun, and I left, and then a few hours later, I got it, which was honestly the fastest turnaround also. Do you want more bots? Sure. I'll take more bots if you're offering. We're almost five months into this experiment, and it's time to take Dom to the next level. I just purchased more bots for her, and she'll soon have 250,000 followers. With all this fame, we're gonna see if we can get Dominique some free vacations, and we're gonna try to get her paid real money to sell products to her hundreds of thousands of followers, even if they're not exactly real. Now, there's a little caveat here. When you start going for the big brands with billions of dollars in revenue, they have access to fancy software that can tell if you have fake followers or inauthentic reach, which for us can be pretty terrifying. So rather than risk getting caught, I ran Dom's account through one of these paid programs. Not only did the software report that she had almost 100,000 real and engaged followers, but it also said that she ranked in the top 0.01% of the most famous people on the planet. How did we pull that off? Either I'm really fucking good at buying bots, or the software is a scam too. Maybe, like, look over that way. Yeah. Thank you for calling Hotel Bel-Air. This is Jeremy speaking. Hi, my name's Dominique Druckman. I'm obsessed with your hotel. Hi, I'm Dominique Druckman.

She's got paid partnerships with a makeup and jewelry company, and we just got this opportunity, the hallmark of influencer fame: A free all-expense-paid vacation, which includes a free hotel suite for Dom and a friend, a $1,000 shopping spree, bottle service at a club, dinner at a five-star restaurant, and spa treatment.

And yet what was so strange was, when you scrolled through Instagram, all those influencers we were trying to emulate, they were still posting photos of themselves as if everything was perfectly normal. They were posting pictures of themselves on the beach, even though the beaches were closed. ♪ ♪ Flights were canceled, hotels shuttered, and yet you wouldn't know it from looking at their accounts. ♪ ♪ No. No. Jewelry! That's fun. As for Dom, as the global economy started to collapse and millions of people lost their jobs, businesses were so desperate to make a sale that they were still sending her free stuff.

Can't you notice or acknowledge or call action to something that's not yourself and your body on the beach? It just feels inauthentic and shows me something I don't want to do. I think, like, through a lot of the process, I was very, like, "I don't care about fame," but during quarantine, I have seen what fame, if used properly, can do. Seeing people like John Legend using his talent and his fame to bring people joy and happiness and a sense of relief during a time like this... Seeing everybody clap for the frontline workers and first responders in all different cities and all different countries through social media... And people who are able to reach a lot of their followers and donate tens of thousands of dollars to food banks and hospitals has been incredible. And the "SNL" video when Brad Pitt was on and he took off his wig and he was just like, "I want to thank the frontline workers." Thank you for your calm and your clarity in this unnerving time. ♪ ♪ In the midst of all of this, Dom even started getting real followers, thousands of them, because people holed up at home were spending more time on social media and assumed she was actually famous. She also kept getting countless free stuff, including a bidet, which she posted online and which, curiously, went legitimately viral without me having to buy the fake likes and fake comments. Okay. Stop. That's enough. I have had so many people say, like, "This made my week. I was laughing so hard." So if I can do that for more people, I think that'd be incredible, and I think that goes along with fame. And then there's the influencers. We headed to Miami Art Basel. - What up, boo? - What up, boo? We've been copying these influencers by faking it just like them, and throughout this whole process, as we peeled back layer after layer of what really happens behind the scenes, I kept wondering if any of it was real, if anything these influencers did was actually authentic.
