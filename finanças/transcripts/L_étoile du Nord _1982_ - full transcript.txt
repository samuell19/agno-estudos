EGYPT, JANUARY 1934 This stone is probably an Indian ruby. I didn't check it, because I don't have any clients who might be interested, but, it's a museum piece. You could have told me when I brought it to you, right? Then, why do you force me to come back? I see... Good morning, sir. Yes, I recognize this ring. My mother donated it, just before she died, to a man who served her for a long time. Yes, a Frenchman she had fallen in love with. Yes, it's this one. And, what happened to that man? Oh, he has no more money. He says he wants to go back to France but has no way to pay for his ticket. How much are the tickets? I think, around 30 Guineas. Fine. Give him the ring back, And I'll pay for the tickets. You see? He seduced the whole family. Mom! Good morning, miss. Oh, good morning. How are you doing? What are you doing here? When did you get back? This is for mother. They're called "babouches." - -She'll fall down in these! - - Yes. Not very practical. This is for father. And this... ... is for you! - -Give it! - - No! What is it? Tell me, how was it there? It's like honey. You wouldn't know. The men. I mean the Egyptians. Like honey, too? There are some good ones, yes. Nice ones. Wealthy ones. One, in particular. - -Is that his car? - - Yes. It's amusing... For six months, I had not met a single interesting one. It had to happen on the boat trip home. At first, I mistook him for an Englishman. He was so rude. Sorry. Excuse me. What an oaf! His name is Nemrod. Do you know him? I know them all! Need help? - -I do! - - Give me one. You know, I'm in second class. We won't see that one in second class. You know, it's only one floor away. And, he was right. He introduced me to Nemrod on the second day. On the third day, I moved up to first class. A cabin the size of a living room, and shiny furniture! And a real bed, too. For two, of course. And in the evening, we had dinner at the captain's table... then champagne! No cheap booze there. I saw poor Édouard walking outside looking like an abandoned puppy. I felt bad! In the train from Marseilles to Paris, I asked Nemrod to invite him to our table. I should be in Naples, dancing in front of those white-collared spaghetti eaters. What about you, good sir... Where should you be by now? Oh, I don't know... Alexandria, or somewhere in the desert, with a lord of my acquaintance... or at least with Yasmina. Come on, old man, stop dreaming. Your protector died. You're going to Paris. You're a Frenchman, aren't you? I wonder. All I know is I was happy in Alexandria, but that's no longer the case. So... Why not Paris? Why not? When you don't belong anywhere. I don't know what got into me. Perhaps it was Nemrod's wickedness. But I wanted to cheer Édouard up. He helped me without asking for anything in return. When people don't ask for anything, I want to give everything. Édouard. I'm in car eleven, compartment six. Not seven. He's in there. Don't make any noise. I'll see you in half an hour. You're wondering what I'm doing here! One day, in Beirut, I found a gold bar in the bedframe... So I always look around. What do you think? I believe in miracles. Did he do this to you? I've known nastier men. So I'm not going to complain. He's taking me to Brussels. And after that? Brussels is where I live! And after that... We may go further. I'm very happy. It happened thanks to you. I'm burning up. Feel how hot I am right now. You hand is cool. Would you like to sleep with me? He is a heavy sleeper. That's all I have left. The last gift from Yasmina. I was often tempted to sell it. But I told myself, "No!" I'll take it home. And I will buy a new life with it. A hotel or a garage. But deep inside, I'm a little afraid to part with it. It's like I have a special treasure. With that treasure, I could live as a pauper. You hide it well, I hope. You think? In a sock perhaps? Yes. Poor guy! What time is it? Oh no! You have to go! He goes to sleep and wakes up early. So I won't see you anymore? I don't have your address. I don't have one. I'm sure we will meet again. It's a small world. You never saw him again? What for? He went off in Paris. He was a good man. You would like him. Me? Affection isn't my thing. THE NORTH STAR The streets of Paris are running red with blood! Blood spills in the streets of Paris! Read "Le Soir" for all the details! "Le Soir," sir! "Le Soir"! Ask for "Le Soir"! Police are shooting up villages, Hundreds are dead in the provinces. Read all the details! Read "Le Soir"! Latest edition! Hundreds dead in the provinces! Get all the details! Read "Le Soir"! Nazis out, Nazis out! Your attention, please. Platform number one. - The Paris- - Amsterdam train going through Brussels will leave in two minutes. You will find the dining car at the front of the train. The train will depart momentarily. She'll be furious. Tell her I'm coming back on Saturday. And don't forget to give her the gift. What gift? No news for six months, and all of a sudden you're here. Is that yours? A friend lent me his car. And I took the opportunity. A friend? I don't want to know how he got it, but a car like that... It's a long story. I will tell you later. I hope so. Did you just arrive or were you leaving? I was just about to leave. I have to return the car. I understand. You better. What about dad? Your father is on duty in Ostende. You should get going, if you're so busy. Mom! Are you not happy to see me? Didn't you miss me at least a little? Of course... But I got used to it. Toinette. You didn't close the engineer's window. Please go close it. See you Saturday then? Yes, Saturday. German tourists. They wanted only one room. He's pointing them to the barracks. He is not back yet, but a young lady left a message. My little treasure hunter. What are you doing here? Were you following us? You must be in love with me! Are you crazy? Maybe, because the other one gets jealous easily. Don't worry, I'm not staying. I'm just passing by. But... Why did you come here? I thought you could help me. Sell it? You're the only one I know here. I have a friend who could help. We could try her first. Also, you aren't wrong. It's diamond city, here. This is a ruby. Same thing! What are you doing? You know you can't stay here. Here! - -But where will I go? - - Anywhere. Just get out! Wait for me at the brasserie opposite the hotel. Are you there? Found a lady friend for tonight? I will take care of it. All I am asking for is... beautiful teeth! I know. Where did you put your things? In a locker. - -Do you have the money? - - No. I bought this coat with everything I had left. Very chic. Here. Pay me back with the ring. - -Édouard, this is Arlette. - - Hello. We have known each other for fifteen years. We took communion together. So tell me. Is your godfather still a jeweler? Yes. Why? Give it here. He doesn't sell stuff like that. It's far too beautiful. We just want to know the price. Do you mind taking Édouard with you? Of course, it will be a pleasure. - -Show me your teeth. - - Excuse me? Never mind. They look nice. I would have loved to live in your country. Even when at night, they bring you fruit! These are exclusively meant for goddesses. Room 17, please. - -Here you are, madam. - - Thank you. This way. Stop it. Wait a second. It's over there. Be careful. My godfather's a bit deaf but he still has very sharp eyes. When will you be back? Tomorrow night. Is your friend also free tomorrow night? I love her teeth. I noticed. In the end, my godfather was right! Do you want to ask someone else? That's enough. Every time it's more of a fake. I am so sorry. So? What is it? It's sugar. It'll melt. What? How is that possible? Is it really fake? Seriously? That bitch singer of yours! I'm truly sorry. So... What are you going to do? I'm not sure yet. You're really unlucky. It was too good to be true. You're going to have to hustle. Will you go back to Paris? Maybe. I don't care. Sorry, but I have no time to comfort you. I have to go now. Let's go. I'm so sorry. Wait a sec. You still didn't book a hotel room? No. If you give me your word that you'll be careful and lay low, you can stay at mine. Okay? - -What about him? - - He's going to Paris for business. Right. Don't come before ten though. His train doesn't leave until 9:30. I'll see you soon. Waiter. Rum, please. Come in. You can take the table away. Well! I told you not to come before ten. I meant in the evening. Did you find something better? You're not with Arlette, are you? May I lie down? Take off your coat, you'll get a crease. Get dressed. You have to leave as quickly as possible. Read this. EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN MURDERED And? And? Are you playing games with me, Édouard? All I need to do is make one move and all the policemen in Brussels will come. What do you mean? What I mean is that your coat is stained with blood and your pockets are full of bank notes. - -Where did this come from? - - I have no idea! Maybe someone put them in my pocket? I don't know! I slept all night at the bistro. My coat was in the cloakroom. Go and ask them. Right. Some day, we'll do that. But now, get dressed. Hurry! Nemrod forgot his ticket. Look! - -How far? - - Fifty kilometers. Look. When I was young, there was a Luna Park. With a little luck, we'll find a hair salon that's open. Why? I like your hair like that! It's for you, idiot. Have you seen your face? I'll be more relaxed when we get there. Try not to go outside. And don't forget. You don't know me. My mother gets so suspicious. You won't come see me? They'll come for me too. Who? The police! Édouard. I hope you are not lying. Here you go. I warmed this up for you, did my best. Good evening, Mr. engineer. Good evening, Mrs. Baron. Toinette. Wine for Mr. engineer. Oh, I changed your bed sheets today, Monday is a holiday. Thank you, Mrs. Baron. Everything all right, Mr. Domb? Something missing? It's my vodka flask. To pour on my bacon. I forgot to buy one. Water, Toinette. Let the tap run. If it turns white, you don't want to drink it. Listen to this. - "The Zion- - Wallonia Charity suspends all scholarships for Jewish students." They don't even give a reason why. So? In Poland, it's been like that for some time. That's not to your country's credit, sir. You're one to talk. Alright, children. Leave that to the League of Nations. How does this thing work? That's not for smoking. You are eating too fast, Mr. Valesco. Toinette, get the door. I'm here for the room. Mum, he's here for the room! - -Good evening, sir. - - Good evening. I'm here to rent a room. Come in, sir. Thank you. Toinette, help him. Please, this way, sir. Finish serving dinner. The liver is for the engineer. This will do just fine. Looks very cozy. Exactly what I need! It's more expensive than the other rooms, but it is the biggest. Here's rent for a month. Do you have anything else? I won't have any change. That won't be necessary. Will it be full or half-board? Full board, please. I'll bring your meal. No, thank you. Not for tonight. I need to sleep. It's about my health. I came here to get some rest. Will you have enough hangers? Yes, quite enough. What a smell. If you don't like it, you can throw it away. No, no. It smells like a garden. I love gardens. It's been five years since I smelled lavender. It's a mix. It's from a tenant I had before. He's now a pharmacist in Toulon. Every year, he sends me fragrant herbs. I'll unpack my bags. Then, I'll go to bed. Good night, sir. A tenant at this hour? - -Yes. - - How is he? He's fine. He seems tired. He is here to rest. Jolly! We'll have to tiptoe around. I did not say that. Don't forget the lemons for Mr. Domb. We ran out. He can eat an apple like the others. They're the same color anyways. VACANCIES - ROOM FOR RENT Good morning, madam. Good morning, sir. Go right ahead. It'll get dirty by noon anyways. Do you have coffee? Yes, but... - -I could have brought it to you. - - Here. Would you like something to go with it? Perhaps a little bit of buttered toast. Where I'm from, it's too hot! Where are you from? Egypt. Maybe you met my daughter there. Your daughter? Yes, she is a dancer. She went on tour to... Tripoli, Cairo, and Beirut. I was in Alexandria. Egypt is a big country, you know? Yes... Ah! The pyramids! They're much more impressive in person. I can believe that. Thank you! Who recommended this place to you? The barber. Mr. Van Der Cruyssen? On a small plaza around here. Yes, that's him. I came to Brussels for business, a garage. Then, I got sick. It could be the food, there. Or maybe the different climate. - -Are you French? - - Yes. My name is Binet. Édouard Binet. Mr. Binet, you'll have to think about filling the form. Anytime you want. No rush. Do you have other tenants? Yes, I have four right now. Moses is very young, and he is not from here. His mother sends him some money, but she doesn't make much. He has a scholarship. He is studying languages and chemistry. The others, are they foreigners, too? Yes. Yes, there's a Polish man. He works in biology, studies races. And this Romanian fellow. I don't really know what he does. Bit foppish. We also have the engineer, a Frenchman like you. But we only see him at night. To be frank, Mr. Binet... I don't allow them to bring women in here. That is the rule. I understand, Mrs. Baron. If you're done, I'll show you the bathroom. It's on the first floor. Don't be discouraged if it takes a while for hot water to come out. This is an old neighborhood. I would also ask you not to waste it. According to an old Coptic saying, "One should never throw water out the window, even stagnant." Coptic? What's that? They're a group of Egyptians. - -Here you go, Mr. Binet. - - Thank you. I left there when I was 30. There, I discovered adventure, and above all, the warmth of a nation. Thank you, Mrs. Baron. My only credit was being French. But there, they love the French. Especially the elites, which allowed me to live in the company of the lords. I was able to visit all of the Orient. I have met the most amazing characters. And the most unique. Excellent vegetables, Mrs. Baron. Did I put enough pepper? I know you like it spicy over there. Quite right! Everything burns hot, there. The sun shines everywhere. In the golden statuettes, the chests filled with jewels, and the palace mosaics... Shining in bright, silver reflections through the foliage, near the ancient river. Shining on Egypt is the sun of the past. This is what keeps Egypt going. We can't say they care much for that past. But do you know, Mrs. Baron? There are sandals from the ancient past that look new even now, as if Ramses II had just put them on to browse the papyrus of the day. Am I making you uncomfortable? Not really. Why? Because of your first name. Mr. Moses. Right. He had his flaws, like everyone else. For a moment, I thought about setting up my own business. Belts for the ladies. Snakeskin has always been very sought after. To catch cobras, you have to snag them right as they wake up! After that, scales lose their shine. Then I changed my mind. I was too fond of Yasmina. She was the greatest singer of the East! Yasmina's success, her triumph, her glow... Everywhere she went, she had fanatics. Excuse me. Yasmina! Yasmina! Careful! Easy... No, through there! Through the other door. Here. Come take a look. What a sight! She had this sort of beauty... She seemed to glow from the inside. I said "was" because unfortunately, she passed away. My life was never the same. She seems too young to have died. She had a voice that came from another world. Every time she sang, we heard the people's suffering, all their joys, and their aspirations. My daughter, Antoinette, has a phonograph. I can lend it to you, if you want. With pleasure! Look at this. Beautiful, right? - -Is that her car? - - Indeed! She ordered it from a car maker in Paris, who happened to be my employer. I was entrusted to bring it over for her. But, where do I sit? Here, madam. In the front. Here? Next to the driver? - -Impossible! - - So drive it yourself. I don't know how! Maybe your husband, then? - -I have no husband. - - Pity. A beautiful car like this... Alright! Let's go! Come on! You hear that, right? You're dreaming. You must be homesick. Allah be with us! Mrs. Baron won't even let me listen to the wireless. She is with him, in his room. Pretty, isn't it? It's original. Do you recognize this, Mr. Baron? There's one framed - in the Paris- - Marseilles train. But did you know the sphinx was the first known Pythia in history? Looks more like a big cat. A cat seer, because when young Oedipus came before him to ask his famous questions, do you know what this creature said? "The time is near, Oedipus, when you will take your father's life" "And then..." "You will share..." "You will share your mother's bed." Can you imagine? With his mother! The worst part is that it actually happened. He killed his father unwillingly, in an accident, without knowing it was his father. And on the same evening, still in the throes of emotion, he entered his mother's bed without knowing it was her. When he realized that, do you know what he did? He stabbed both his eyes out. Tragic. How long 'til dinner? Here, the food's ready. Toinette, go get Mr. Édouard. Mr. Valesco won't be joining us tonight. The day after tomorrow, I will start the night shift. I thought it was next week. Jandron is ill and there are extra trains at the end of the week. - -Here. - - Thank you. Mr. engineer. Thank you, Mrs. Baron. Mr. Édouard. Leeks and potatoes! With a little bit of milk! Toinette, get some milk. Good night, everyone! Not after midnight, Mr. Valesco. Tomorrow morning then? When he comes back, he smells of perfume. Mrs. Baron, don't you like perfume? Then you wouldn't like Egypt. Because over there, you can't take a step without the smell of roses caressing you. And the heliotropes! The heliotropes of the Mahmoudiyah Canal... The calm and sensual Nile. The great purifier of children and animals. She is the nourishing mother of the land she fertilizes, which she sows, and sometimes floods in her anger. She is the accomplice of the villages she irrigates. The flowers and trees carry their scent throughout the Delta. Do you know what we call a heliotrope when it is still white? The sunflower. Just a plain sunflower by the water's edge. And a bonus ten points! Yes, the bonus ten points go to the one who clinches the last trick. But you didn't count it for me last night. Of course I did, Yasmina dear. So. Two, four... Were the little girls relatives? No, they were from a small village. Yasmina loved little girls. I have to admit it. What do you mean exactly, Mr. Édouard? What's wrong with caressing a little girl? Yasmina was a woman... Indeed. You know, you can't compare the narrow views here in the West and the more liberal views that exist over there. At least Yasmina liked men, right? Without a doubt. Listen, whether in China or Egypt, there are things I cannot approve. Mr. Moses, would you like your herbal tea? Here. Toinette, go make it. I will also take one, please. So, to come back to it all, feelings and such... Personally, I always thought a man and a woman were made to be a couple. For someone to choose someone else of the same age, for life. Because love is mostly about harmony. This is the first time I saw those cups. How old was Miss Yasmina? Because... There comes a time, you know, for a woman, when it becomes a little indecent. All there should be is tenderness. Isn't that right? Listen to this. Here's what they say about Egypt. What a world! The wave of crimes sweeping the world is even reaching the trains. "Murder in a sleeping car compartment, in the North Star train." If this keeps up, I will have to ask for a gun. Imagine I come across some lunatic on my shift... And it's all true, look! "An Egyptian businessman was savagely murdered and robbed of a large sum of money. The investigation points towards Brussels, where the victim took the train." "Savagely"! Maybe you knew him. - -Why? What was his name? - - They don't say. These stories make me shiver. I understand, Mrs. Baron. With your permission. Good night. I wish you all a good night. Good night, Mr. Édouard. He was quite ill. He didn't look it. That doesn't mean a thing. And tell me, Mr. Moses Kaler, you don't study medicine, do you? - -May I see it? - - Of course. WALLOON OR FLEMISH, WE ARE ALL UNEMPLOYED Good morning, miss! Hello. Look who's here. Who is this all for? New tenant in the room downstairs. Quite a story. Don't bother. I know. What... Feeling cozy in here, are we? Do you have plans other than breakfast? What are you doing here? - -I thought we didn't know each other. - - Now, we do. Read this! This again? Yes. Yes, this again, as you said... I had nothing to do with it! Yeah right. Meanwhile, the police are after me. So far, they don't know you exist. I haven't told them yet. But it won't last. That's why it would be better for you to make plans. We're lucky here. We are not far from Germany and the Netherlands. Oh, leave me alone. I'm fine here. With family. - -Are you still at the Wilhelmine? - - You're one to talk! They wanted me to change rooms, those bastards. Under the roof, no hot water. So I left. Now I am at Arlette's. Arlette is a sweetheart. Where is the money? In the lamp. Are you kidding me? In the curtain rod. To the left. You better not spend it. I burnt all I had. Come to think of it. Did you pay mother with one of the bills? Hello. Is Sylvie here? Where is she? With Édouard. Ah. What do you mean, "Ah"? So, you didn't tell me you knew each other. And that maybe you sent him here. I really wonder how you came to meet someone like him. The car... Was it him? That one is dead. What do you mean, dead? Well... He died... in a train. But isn't it... Toinette! Go do the rooms. Was it the one in the papers? It keeps getting better, doesn't it? You're in deep trouble, girl. I had nothing to do with that. - -Are you looking for something? - - No. I know who won't be happy. Your father. Don't tell him. It's not about telling him, but if they come here for questions... The police, for example. Why would they come here? It has nothing to do with it. I should hope so! I would like to help you, but... I don't have much time. Since you were born, you never had time for housework. - -I am leaving now. - - Alright, good bye. Are we going to see you often now? There is nothing between Mr. Édouard and me, if that's what you mean. He's just a friend. It's better that way. Bye, Toinette, I'll be back soon. It's craftsmanship. Did you rest well, Mr. Édouard? I slept like a mummy. It really is quite something. I would say there is something magical about it. - -Do you think so? - - Absolutely. In Alexandria, where we went often to meet the governor, the ironing ceremony, which was part of the daily routine was considered a sacred moment. Even for the silk shirts, for example, they often used two irons at the same time. Here. I will show you. Allow me. By crisscrossing them like this. Something like this. Like a ritual. Excuse me. My Eastern friends know nothing of triviality. Even their most simple occupation becomes an eternal moment. And their idleness, too, for that matter. You have to be fair. At least for them, everything is beautiful and elegant. You lied to me, Mr. Édouard. Egypt is not that big. You knew my daughter. Yes. I met her on a boat. I like her very much. Oh, I know men find her very attractive. Sometimes too much. I would like to believe she had nothing to do with it. You knew that man too. Who? The one who's dead. A little bit, yes. He was someone... how do we call it? This shirt, Mrs. Baron, is neither cotton nor silk. It refuses to be cotton and would like to have been real silk. But it is neither. He was a bit like that. A mixture. Well, that's no reason to get murdered. Of course. A sudden and violent death is always a shock. Maybe it's a little less true there, where the idea of life is perpetuated, even in death. Yes, maybe. But we are not used to these ideas anymore. Kebehsenuf. Horus, I think, madam. Yasmina, we should go home now. No, the car is over here. No, it has been a tiring day. Please be reasonable! Leave it to me! I wouldn't ride these things for the world. How do they have eyes like that? It's kohl. It's a type of makeup they use over there. This ring is beautiful. It's ruby. Rubies are red, right? She kept it to her dying day. I had gone out to buy her one last present. As a token of my veneration, and my affection. A bright-colored bird she hesitated to buy a few days before she fell ill. I bought it for you. You're crazy, my love. We'll give it to him. It is a real treasure. And I am its keeper. I will let you rest, Mr. Édouard. Thank you, Mrs. Baron. I'm going to take a little nap. Must have suited you well. Oh yes. Excuse me. I promised I'd go play the harmonium. - -Have a good night. - - Good night. Seventeen times! In the head! Seventeen times! Seventeen! I'm sure it's a political crime. Why political? I don't see why. We live in violent times. In the paper, they only mention a big sum of money. Why couldn't it be a settled score? I know these people very well. I like them a lot. - -But at times, they can be so arrogant. - - You have to understand them. - -The Egyptians are like the Czechs. - - Good night everyone! Don't worry, Mrs. Baron! I have all I need. I bet you were talking about the crime. What I don't get, is the 17 hits. It's 16 times too much. Right? Especially for money. It's probably less simple than that. We can picture it quite well. Where did it happen exactly? In the aisle or the toilet? In the compartment! In the compartment. Right. So there could have been a brawl. The killer did not stay long, I suppose. Paper says it only took a few minutes. Between 11:00 p.m. and midnight. Right. It always happens in a few minutes. So the victim sees the killer coming. He understands and gets ready to defend himself. You don't know how tenacious these people can be We must do them justice. Brave and prideful, at all times! Look at the Red Sea. And then, ask the English. So. The victim defends himself and resists bravely, which only increases the killer's fury tenfold. This explains why he was so relentless. Who wouldn't be in such a situation? You, maybe. Toinette, be polite. What I still can't understand, is how the killer was able to get on the train and in the compartment. My colleagues have eyes. They're not children. Maybe he was disguised as a ticket inspector. Certainly not. The uniforms are personal. Unless there was an accomplice on the train. What are you saying? Say what you're really thinking! Dear! - -What do you mean? - - Come on. He didn't mean that. He didn't mean... Right. I haven't forgotten what he told me last year on the evening of January 3rd. No, Mr. Domb. I haven't forgotten. We railway workers have good memories. You said that the Warsaw Express had no heat. Well, I checked, and you lied. There was heat. Our Polish colleagues are as careful as we are. You know what, Mr. Domb? Sleeping cars are international. Mr. Baron. No, really. When it comes to railways, he's like a child. Nevertheless, the more I think about it and the more I tell myself, in a case like this, we must look beyond the surface. There are facts. And then what lies beneath. I see revenge. The revenge of a man who was humiliated. Scorned. Wronged. Good night, Mr. Édouard. Good night, Mrs. Baron! I wanted to tell you... I wanted to ask you. I know you don't really know her, but... what do you think of Sylvie? Sylvie? She's a very charming, young girl. She's lively, spontaneous... We don't see it at first glance, but I think she's someone who considers life to be a bit of a sport. Don't you think she is a bit reckless? You know, Mrs. Baron, if you go that way, everything is reckless. Being born is reckless. No, Sylvie's from another generation. You have to trust them. They may take more risks than we did. But perhaps, their lives are more interesting, too. That's true. I thought about it sometimes. Me... I couldn't have done what she did, to go abroad like that. But... I would have liked to, for sure. I almost left once... with my fiancé. Then the war came and he died, in 1916. Then, we had to wait for the war to end, learn to love life again. But when we did, we enjoyed it all we could. And we forgot everything else. Everything had changed! Everything was moving, there were flowers everywhere. Even by the coal mines. Then I got lucky and met Mr. Baron. I understand, Mrs. Baron. Good night, Mr. Édouard. If you don't mind, may I go and have a wash? Oh, not at all. But, I cannot promise there will be hot water. Oh, that's fine! You threw it too far. Rats! Must've fallen on the other side. - -Come on, try harder! - - It's too high. - -I got it! - - Give it here! Thank you, Miss Antoinette. You are too kind. I brought you the papers. You'll find something interesting. What is it, sweetheart? The Egyptian gentleman, from the train. The Egyptian gentleman from the train... Yes, struck 17 times. He was Sylvie's lover. They met on the boat. You introduced her to him, right? So, did you know him well? - -Well enough, yes. - - His loss must've affected you a lot. We weren't friends. I was worried about Sylvie. You don't show it. Antoinette. You don't like me very much, do you? New dress? No, it's an old one. I am fixing the neckline, because at my age... Even though, after everything we've seen since the war... Nice pattern. This must look nice on you. Is it for Sundays? No, not particularly. Does it look fancy? A little bit. I like what you did with your hair. As for the slippers, I don't know why people laugh. They're very comfortable. Yes but... They keep slipping off. Sure, they take a bit to get used to. After a while, you will swear by them. I think they're worth a hundred times the slippers sold here. So, I got chicken... ...and mutton, there was no lamb. I got zucchini, carrots, turnips, peppers, and chickpeas. All of that? No, Mr. Édouard. Don't eat it raw like that. Cleopatra loved raw zucchini. One of her cooks served them in a stew, she had him put to death! I can't wait to see their faces. Another dollop, Mr. engineer? Yes, please. We make it spicier over there, but here, we thought... Mr. Domb, more semolina? No thank you. I did not know Egyptians ate couscous as well. Don't forget Yasmina was of Berber origin. Have some more vegetables, if you like it, Mr. Valesco. I love it all! What a meal! Have some of this. You are very shy, Mrs. Baron. You're lucky to have such oriental talents, you should use them, not hide them. I had nothing to do with it, Mr. Valesco. Mr. Édouard did everything. You also hid that from us? We all have something to hide, my dear Antoinette. Leave this, Toinette. We'll do it tomorrow. Go to bed. I will give this back tomorrow. Right. - -Thank you for the herbal tea. - - Mr. Édouard. Earlier at dinner, you said we all had something to hide. I felt guilty. Guilty? Why? I wanted to ask you... and this is not an idea that came to me tonight. It's been on my mind for quite some time. I wanted to ask you to come with me tomorrow on Sunday. Tomorrow, where? I think with you, I'll feel braver. I have to make a visit. And my husband doesn't know about it. Come in, Mr. Édouard! You have a visitor. It will keep your mind off of things. A traveler, a great traveler! Please have a seat. Mr. Édouard is from Egypt! Trees still had leaves last time you came by. Look, Albert, I was busy every Sunday. Time flies, you know. You don't think I know? Today, your husband is at work. How do you feel? Where I can feel things, it's fine. But down there... It's been a long time since I've felt anything below the belt. Enjoy your legs and the rest, young man. Because the war wasn't the last, let me tell you! And it will be a bloodbath. - The Franco- - Belgian treaty is as good as gone. Useless words, full of pigeon shit! Compared to what it's going to be, this is a drop in the North Sea. No more trenches... It will all fall from the sky. A beehive... Mass graves full of guts, blood and shit! Women... they'll rip them apart! Nuns will be quartered, everyone will bite it! Ashes, tears... The horror! The great fear! Albert... He isn't like that all the time. I put myself in his place. No, you can't be in my place! Nobody can! Here. Take this. Is it beautiful, in Egypt? Is he one of your tenants? Yes! He is with us to get some rest. Get some rest, huh? It really is a resting place. I like éclairs. But I wouldn't mind a bottle of cognac. When you were young, you were a lot more daring. She was a fiery flame, but now... Please, Albert! Don't "please" me! You don't have to blush about the past. Did you have time to travel before? No, never. But... At 14 years old, I bought a ticket to Melbourne. I only had Australia in my mind. Have you ever been to Australia? Blaise... It's Blaise. One less! Always eating, this one! - -Have you been to Australia, then? - - No. So. Tell me, how is Egypt? You said your fiancé was dead. It was a figure of speech. You know, he wasn't always like that. He used to be a nice, kind man. I wanted you to meet him because now you know. I could have also gone on boats and traveled around. Instead, I take care of my tenants and watch them leave. But Mrs. Baron, you do travel. When your residents go, you travel with them. They carry the memories of a woman who helped them, They won't forget that! I'll be right back. What is she doing there? This time she will hear from me. Now, now, Mrs. Baron. Think about your twenties. Come on. A little walk like that feels good, right? Thank you very much, Mr. Édouard. And on top of that... ...you take walks outside. Are you out of your mind? - -I'll be lucky if they don't follow me. - - Have they started questioning you again? What do you think? Huh? Where do you think you are? Are you really going mad? Get this. Now, they are very interested in Nemrod's acquaintances on the boats. You're one of them, my dear Édouard. By tomorrow, they will know it was you who introduced me to him. So if you will please pack up your things, kindly say goodbye to everyone and disappear! I don't want to leave. So you want my mother to finish her life in jail? What if it wasn't me? Huh? My poor Édouard. You took one risk in your entire life, and you don't even remember it. I put them in the closet. You see how careful I am? Under the shirts. Brilliant. Did you spend any? I just took four. Here! You can pack your things. Well! I was expecting you tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow is your father's birthday! But you're right. I didn't expect you to remember. I have other things in mind, you know? Listen. What is it again? Listen, mother. I know you can keep a secret but I am warning you right now. This one is heavy. Édouard... What about Édouard? This Édouard that you pamper so much. Do you know who he really is? Mr. Édouard is a very nice man who feels a little lost and needs to be taken care of. Can't you understand that? Mom. He's a murderer. He killed Nemrod. They barely knew each other. He followed him on the train, maybe they talked about me. Still, Édouard lost his temper. He robbed and killed him. What are you saying? The truth. I thought I did good when I sent him to you. I thought he would leave. Do you understand? I didn't think he was going to stay for long. I'm sorry. I don't believe you. I wouldn't believe it even if he told me. He won't tell you anything. It got out of his head. - -He forgot everything. - - You're talking nonsense! Don't worry, I'll send him away. He has to go. Right? No one can know. This is only between you and me. In two days, he won't be here. It will be like I didn't say anything. What are you eavesdropping for? Who are you spying on? Go to your room! Meanwhile, try to think of a good reason why I saw you at the café, with Mr. Valesco! They lost track of Édouard on the boat. Now, they're looking for him in France. This will give us a little more time. Well... His name isn't there. No one can tell that's him. No. Robbed him... As if he needed to! Haven't you seen his ring? His ring! It's a fake! A knockoff! He can't sell it. Next time you buy me stockings, I'd like silk. These are itchy. Listen, Toinette. I don't know what you heard, but... Don't worry. I never trusted him. He's a liar. Okay, then keep your mouth shut and don't say anything to anyone. I can't come every day. Meanwhile, give him hints that you know about him. You'll scare him away. Understand? Do you understand? At least he knows you don't like him. The day after tomorrow, he needs to be gone. Do whatever you want, but the day after tomorrow... So, since you're done playing with him, I'm the one getting rid of him. You really are special. Hey! My bras are starting to get a little tight. Think about it. You better burn it. Be quiet. And there you go. Is Mr. Édouard not dining with us? He said he wasn't hungry. He has a fever. Where did he catch it? He doesn't get out much. Indeed, we won't find him in cafés with girls much younger than him. Tell me, is the funeral of King Albert I a holiday? At universities, it is. Not down the mines. Well look at that. His fever is gone. Fever? To tell you the truth, I am a bit hungry. Dare I ask for a little cheese and butter on bread? I'm sorry, Mr. Édouard. As you can see, my hands are wet. Show me where it is, and I will manage. You can leave it here. I will finish on my own. Go to bed. And don't smoke in your room. It stinks in the morning. Take this. Mr. Édouard will help you when he finishes eating. There had to be something unpleasant about the place. I would even call it the eighth plague of Egypt. As far as sheep and goats go, it's fine. But the rest... Mr. Édouard, tonight I am not in the mood to listen to you. Your stories of princes and pyramids... God knows I loved them. Now, it's over. We welcomed you here as a family would. We're a family here, Mr. Édouard. A family. Mr. Domb, Mr. Moses, Valesco, the engineer... It's hard enough as it is. For a few pennies, I give them a place. They're like at home, almost. That makes me proud. And for you, it was the same. And as a reward, you lied to me! You have compromised us all and dragged my daughter into a sordid affair! How could you have done this? I don't know, I don't know anymore. You don't know? Oh, he doesn't know. "Seventeen times with a glass decanter." "The murderer attacked his victim with incredible brutality." Lies, all of it! I would remember it! Otherwise, I've gone mad. No, that's too easy. You show up in other people's lives and settle in. Happy with yourself? This is not madness. You mingle among us all, making fun of us as well. This is an honest establishment. Do you know what "honest" means, Mr. Édouard? Mr. Baron is a simple man. He doesn't smile every day, but he never did a bad thing in his life. If at least it was out of love or jealousy, for Sylvie's sake... But money... Money! Money is earned, Mr. Édouard. With our hands or with our head, like the engineer. Not by robbing other people. Even if you don't like them. You are a thief. A thief and a criminal. Or you truly are sick. That can be treated at a hospital. If you are sick, this is not the place. So at dawn, you will leave without making a noise, and you will go back to wherever you came from. To that Egypt of yours. With your Egyptian sun! Your damned Egyptian sun! I don't want to see one bit of it! I don't want to see you anymore. Ever again! Sylvie told me he would take the train to Paris. So I bought a ticket. I looked into the sleeping cars. The frame is probably old. Yes, it is a beautiful frame. But, the stone! Excuse me, but I am afraid it is as fake as the word of the Prophet. Impossible. Yasmina would never give me fake jewelry. The family keeps the real ones, my dear. Either way, it's the gesture that counts. And the frame is gold! After all, I am no expert. If you'd like, in Paris, I know very competent men. Experts, vetted by the courts, whose word cannot be questioned. What are you doing? What's the matter with you? Give that back to me, or I'll call... What do you want from me? I hit him! I hit... I don't know how many times. I took the money! All the money I could! I left, and I closed the door. In the aisle, a dog was barking. Dogs always bark at me. I don't know why. I do like dogs. I killed him, Mrs. Baron. I did kill him. It's over. You didn't know what you were doing, Mr. Édouard. You were not yourself. The proof is that you forgot. You know, the other day, on the wireless, there was a doctor who explained that there are people who suddenly find themselves in a sort of trance, and do things they would never normally do. That could have happened to you. You're not to blame. It was you, and it wasn't you. They'll consider that for sure. In the end... Remembering it all must have been a relief. You will see! You have to sleep now. And in order to sleep, You need to have a clear mind. Think of nothing. Sleep will come. But... you can't tell anyone, right? We'll keep that between us. You'll need to be careful, Mr. Édouard. Sleep, now. - -I haven't packed my bags. - - Later, you'll do it later. What an unbelievable story. Did you think about Mrs. Baron? Don't tell the police or anyone else. We can't do that to your mother. She will never be able to rent a room again. When I say that, I'm not thinking about us, Toinette. That's true. They'll suspect her. Who knows what they'll come up with. There is only one solution after what he did. Make him go away. Quickly. You mustn't leave your room today. We'll say you have the flu. Hello, darling. He's got the flu. Did you make him a fire? Say... How much is a train ticket to Amsterdam? One way? Who's it for? One of Toinette's friends' mother. It's 21 francs for third class. - -I'm going to bed. - - Right. Good morning, Mrs. Baron. - -Hello, Mr. engineer. - - Bit chilly, this morning. - -Oh yes. Mr. Édouard's got the flu. - - Oh, I see. I thought I heard something last night. - -Well, I'll see you tonight, Mrs. Baron. - - See you tonight. - -Good morning, Mrs. Baron. - - Good morning. Gentlemen. We're going into town. Do you need anything? No, I'll go out. I'm not sick. - -Then we'll see you tonight. - - See you tonight. See you tonight! You're not dressed? I just woke up. Is Mr. Édouard sick again? Yes. Ah, can I get the phonograph back? Is he still using it? Yes, but get dressed first. Toinette! Yes, mom? You know it's the 22nd. Yes, and? It's your father's birthday. Did you think about buying him a little gift? No. Are you planning a party? Yes, why? - -Do you feel like doing it? - - No. But your father deserves as much. And he is expecting it. So is there a problem with celebrating? No. Come in. I am pleased to see that you are on your feet. We were a bit worried. Really, it's a shame you have to leave. Are you in trouble, Mr. Édouard? Because I could help you. I am used to trouble. I've gotten into some back in my country. If I'm here, it's because I can't be anywhere else. For me, it was Brazil. Brazil tempted me. How about you? I don't know. I didn't think about it. The biggest hassle is the paperwork. But this can be arranged. Mr. Édouard, as long as we have money, there is still hope! Believe me, because I don't have any. I don't have any either, Mr. Valesco. No kidding. Beautiful cake! That's something! Mr. Baron, allow me to join in and wish you a happy birthday. It's a genuine Parker! It's not new, but in fact, it's even more personal that way. One for work and one for Sundays. I am really spoiled. It's unfortunate Sylvie isn't here. It reminds me of one of my birthdays. My friend Yasmina had done things right. Imagine a gigantic fair with animals from all over the country. That night, we had arranged to put a crown of torches around each animal's hump. Imagine what it looked like in the night, under the sky! Each animal with its flame-lit hump... It was awe-inspiring. They hardly mention it anymore. They're looking for him in Germany. I'd keep my eyes open if I were them. They could find him in his own room. - -See you tonight. - - See you tonight. - -Do they mention the Netherlands? - - No. Why? That's where you ought to go. There are boats. I'll give you money. No. I can't accept. There's no reason to. I have saved up a bit. I'd rather use it to help you. But still. Your Yasmina. Instead of giving you a ring, she could have left you some money. All this wouldn't have happened. Hello, darling. That sparkling wine was no good. Shame. You tossed and turned all night. What about the English? They must have railroads there. Yes, they work well enough. But not always in a timely manner. I wouldn't have liked to work in Egypt. Where is Toinette? She went upstairs. She's doing the rooms. They hardly mention it anymore, eh? All they talk about it politics. Us railway folks are only worth a few lines here and there. They can always look in Germany. But he's here in Belgium. Why do you think that? In Germany or France, they cut off your head for a crime like that. He'd better stand trial here, where they don't sentence you to death. That makes sense, yes. He must be far away by now. - -In America, maybe. - - That's the best he could do. We came to help you pack. You'll take one. For this kind of trip, it's better to be comfortable. Put everything he won't use in here. - -I'll go to the Netherlands. - - Good idea. Your mother told me she would take care of everything. I know. You'll take a train to Brussels tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. And from Brussels, you will take a bus. There, you will manage to cross the border on foot. I won't worry. Are you done? - -Sylvie. - - Yes? Thank you. What for? For everything. Of course. I keep telling myself I should have gone off the boat in Naples. Where are your toiletries? Is there another party tonight? You won't be surprised to hear Mr. Édouard is leaving tomorrow morning. Careful, that's sharp! You're leaving all of your memories with us. From now on, I will have to make others. You're too kind. You already gave me a pen. That' not kindness, Mr. Baron. It's a simple token of our friendship To remind you of the short time I spent with you. Because I will be leaving. I will start a new life. Full of hope and uncertainty. - Haroun Al- - Rachid said: "The sun never rises without bringing about new joy." Well, pray that I see it rise a thousand times more. Yes, come in. There you go. That should be enough for the trip. This is my sister's address in Rotterdam. Well, outside the city but still. Use it only if you need it. I don't want to get her in trouble. Thank you. Mrs. Baron. Give me your hand. I will keep it in case you come back. Mrs. Baron? Yes? Tell me your first name. Louise. Is your father up? I don't think so. Mr. Édouard is ready. Good luck to him. Listen to me, Toinette. And listen well! I ask no one to have regrets. I want him to leave in peace. You understand? In peace! I don't think it'll be that easy. What do you mean? If they're not police, then I'm the Queen of England. Everything ready? Packed bag and a smile on your face? They are here. Now the great Mr. Édouard is going to show us how brave he is. The police? Maybe. If you don't surrender, they'll storm in. Is that what you want? Will we have to die for you? Go! What are you waiting for? They've come for me, Mrs. Baron. You have to surrender. Why? I never wanted this! I didn't even spend the money. I burned it all. They are going to storm in here. They have weapons. - -Mrs. Baron... - - Antoinette. You have to take shelter. You're right. I'll surrender. Toinette, get the bags! Now! Come! Follow me! On the other side, there is a large yard with a gate that is always open. At the end, there is a road that leads to the countryside. They're everywhere. ÎLE DE RÉ - NOVEMBER 1934 How far is Guyana? For them, 24 to 26 days. There are faster boats, though. Don't go! Don't touch me! Leave me alone! Don't go! Get your hands off me! Don't go! No! Get your hands off me! Don't go! Leave me alone! Don't go! Don't go! Édouard! Édouard! Fourth Section. Forward! Let's go Follow the Fifth Section! Come on!
