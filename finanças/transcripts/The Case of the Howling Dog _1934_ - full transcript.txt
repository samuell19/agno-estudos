[ Dog howling ] Did you hear it? What did you say? - You heard the dog howling next door? I didn't hear any dog. - It's driving me crazy. It means a death in the neighborhood. What's that? - Nothing. I may as well talk to these walls. Mr Mason's office. Just a moment. I'll give you his secretary. Mr Mason is in his office. No. You can't see him without an appointment. I am sorry. Won't you sit down? Why can't Mr Mason handle my case personally? He's too busy. I can assure you the firm will represent you satisfactorily. What's the idea? Mason sprung me the last time I was in a jam two years ago. Yes. I know. But at the present time he refers all grand larceny cases to me. Oh yeah? His practice has become so large that he can't handle every case. I got a hunch I'd better jump my bail if he's not going to be on the job. Here's a picture of the husband. Pick him up at the banker's club in half an hour. I'll keep check on the dame's apartment. - Okay. That divorce is in the bag right now. Better use a taxi and keep half a block behind. You're telling me how to shadow a guy? I've been a private detective for twenty years. Yeah. But now you're working for Perry Mason and he wants results. Check. Mr Mason. Yes, Della? There's a young man here with the jitters. I don't know what it's about be he seems to have jumping nerves over a dog. That bays at the moon. You know I can't be bothered with such things. Tell him to go and talk to Morgan. Morgan knows all about dogs. He refuses to see anyone but you. He says it's terribly important. He acts so strangely. I wish you'd see him for a minute. Well, alright. Send him in. Come in, Mr Cartwright. Thank you. Sit down. My secretary told me you wanted to see me about a dog. Yes. About a dog and a will. A will? Let's talk about the will first. As you like. First. A little personal history. Your full name. Arthur Cartwright. Age? - Thirty-two. Residence? 4893 Milpas Drive. Married or single? Do we need to go into that? Yes. I don't think it makes a difference in the will I'm drawing up. On account of the way I'm leaving my property. Just for my own information, your wife's name please. Evelyn Cartwright. Age twenty-seven. Residing with you? - No. Any children? - No. Very well. Now then. How did you want to leave your property? Before we go into that I must know if a will is valid no matter how a man dies. Suppose he dies on the gallows or in the electric chair? You know. Suppose he's executed for murder. Then what happens to his will? It makes no difference how a man dies. His will is not affected. Alright. Suppose I write the will entirely in my own handwriting. Will I need witnesses? No. A will is valid and binding in this state. Provided the date, contents and signature are in your own handwriting. And that there is no other writing on the document. Here's a form if you want it. That seems to clear up that point. I intend to leave my property to Mrs Clinton Foley. Living at 4889 Milpas Drive. A neighbor? - Yes. Remember, Cartwright. Don't have secrets from your lawyer. I won't betray your confidence. That's all there is to it. Alright. Now let's hear about the dog. A dog has been howling for 48 hours. Mostly at night but sometimes during the day. That continual howling is driving me crazy. You know, when a dog howls it's an omen of death in the neighborhood. Where is the dog? In Clinton Foley's house. Suppose you tell me all about it, Cartwright. Look here. There is one more question about the will. Suppose. Suppose Mrs Clinton Foley really shouldn't be Mrs Foley. You know, suppose she lives with him as his wife but is not married to him. It makes no difference if you describe her in the will as Mrs Foley living .. At 4889 Milpas Drive. Alright. Now suppose there is a real Mrs Clinton Foley. I mean, suppose Clinton Foley had been married and never been legally divorced. If you leave your property to the woman who is now residing at that address. As the wife of Clinton Foley. That's all that will be necessary. Good. Good. Now then. About that dog. We've got to do something to stop that howling. I want Clinton Foley arrested. I'm afraid I won't be able to handle this matter for you, Mr Cartwright. I'm exceptionally busy right now. But look here. You've got to handle it. I'll make it worth your while. There is ten thousand dollars. There will be more if you need it. Ten thousand dollars to handle a case over a howling dog? You're forgetting the will. You're to handle that too. Cartwright. If I act as your lawyer in this thing. I'm going to do what I think is for your own best interest no matter what it is. Yes, of course. I understand. Thanks. - Right. Just a moment. I want to call in one of my assistants. I want him to hear the facts in the case. Sure. Doctor. - Yes? I want you to take a look at a client in my office. I must know if he's in his right senses. Why do you think he may be out of his mind? He just paid me ten thousand dollars in cash. As a retainer. - That settles it. A sure sign of insanity. A departure from the normal. I'll say it's a departure from the normal. Mr Cartwright. This is my assistant, Mr Smith. - How do you do, sir. It's about a dog, Smith. - Yes. Clinton Foley. A neighbour of Mr Cartwright, has a police dog that howls. It goes on and on. That howling has to be stopped. Do you hear? What makes him howl? - Foley makes him howl. Why? Because he knows it drives me crazy. You see, it means a death. How long has this been going on? - Since the night before last. I want Foley arrested. We must be careful. Suppose Foley turns round and sues you for malicious prosecution? He'd do that if he could. That's why I came to you. I'd be protected. Very well. Here is what I suggest. We acquaint the district attorney's office of the facts in a fair manner. And ask that a letter of warning be sent to Mr Foley immediately. Requesting he abates the nuisance. No. I want him arrested. You've agreed to act on my advice. If the letter warning Mr Foley has no effect .. We then ask that a warrant be issued. - Alright. See Foley is notified right away. Send it by special messenger. I can't stand any more of that infernal howling. I'll attend to it. - Alright. Thank you, gentlemen. I'm sorry if I'm upset but I've not been sleeping much lately. Well? I can't make a complete diagnosis on such limited observation. I should slay it's a case of agitated melancholia. His nerves are all shot from some great mental stress, eh? Yes. He's not insane, is he? He isn't normal. - I know. But he's not insane? It isn't the degree of irresponsibility .. That saves a man from the penalty of committing a crime. If that's what you mean. Okay, doctor. I guess it's up to me to get rid of that howling dog. Excuse me. I thought you'd retired. Must you always go prowling around the house? What? You attend to your housework. I'll turn off my own lights. That old fool. I'm going out for a little while. What? I am going out to mail a letter. A letter? Who for? Will you mind your own business. I'm going out. Oh. A regular peeping-tom. I've always worked for respectable people. Good morning, Della. What's new? Mostly bills. Honestly, it's a shame the way you spend money. Well, I keep it in circulation. Who takes care of you in your old age? - You will, my dear. You'll take in washing. And I'll sit by the fire and dream of the courtroom triumphs of my youth. Don't forget I got a ten thousand dollar retainer yesterday. From our esteemed client, Mr Cartwright. Here is something more from Mr Cartwright. Special delivery. Come along with me. He says. 'I know now why the dog howled'. 'I want you represent the beneficiary named in the enclosed will'. 'And fight for her interests all the way through'. Did he leave you something? You are getting mercenary this morning. He leaves his property. Nine tenths to Mrs Foley. And one tenth to me. He provides. Well. - What is it? In the office yesterday he told me he wanted to leave his property .. To a woman residing with Clinton Foley as his wife. But he made it pretty clear that she was not legally married to him. Did he do it? - No. He did not. He now leaves his property. To the real Mrs Clinton Foley. The lawfully wedded wife. That does make a difference, doesn't it. Of course it does. It makes it different all the way through. It means. That the real Mrs Foley. Whoever she may be. Will now be my client. I've received my fee. Now I am legally and morally obligated to protect her interests. The question is. What made Cartwright change his mind overnight? [ Telephone ] Yes? It's Mr Drumm. The district attorney. Hello, Claude. What's on your mind? Something came up that you should know about. Clinton Foley intends to ask that your client Arthur Cartwright .. Be sent to the psychopathic ward for observation as to his sanity. Just a moment, Claude. Did you send that letter of warning yesterday to Mr Foley? About his howling dog. Yes I did. Apparently this howling dog business is all part of Cartwright's imagination. Foley believes the man is dangerous. That he has a homicidal complex. Which may cause him to take the law into his own hands. Foley's in my office right now. Alright. Hold him there and I'll be right down. Come in, Perry. We're waiting for you. This is Mr Foley, Mr Mason. How do you do. I have explained the facts to Mr Drumm here. Your client Mr Cartwright is a very peculiar man. He lives like a hermit yet he spies on me out of the windows of his house. Covering every move I make with binoculars. Go on. I'm listening. I think Cartwright is a mental case. He doesn't know what he's doing. I have witnesses to substantiate everything I've been saying. I'm still listening. It makes it very difficult for me to keep my servants. I have only one left now. My housekeeper. The cook and chauffeur left last week. They couldn't stand it anymore. Your servants are highly sensitive individuals. It is annoying to my guests also. The man never has the lights in his house turned on. He parades through his dark rooms at night. With his binoculars. Snooping and spying at everything that goes on in my house. Is it a crime to look through binoculars? That's not the point. You know it. The man is insane. You think so? Because he's reported a howling dog. And the dog doesn't howl. I propose to see that his sanity is enquired into. Alright. I'm just warning you. If you sign a complaint alleging my client is insane. You'd better make a full investigation otherwise there will be trouble. Your ideas about the man's insanity. Are founded on Mr Foley's statement that the dog didn't howl. Is that right? Naturally. Mr Foley says he has witnesses to prove his statement. Until you investigate these witnesses how do you know which one is crazy? Maybe Foley is crazy. - I beg your pardon. Gentlemen, please. All you ask is that we investigate the facts before we do anything? Right. Sheriff's office please. Let me talk with Bill Pemberton. This is Claude Drumm. Listen. We have a dispute here in the office. Involving a couple of millionaires out on Milpas Drive. There's a question of a howling dog. One of them says the dog howls and the other says it does not. One says the other man is crazy. That's a hot one. I didn't know the district attorney had to settle quarrels about dogs. I didn't think he had the time. Why don't you throw those birds out on their ears? I would, but it happens that Perry Mason is here representing one of them. He demands an investigation. I'll be right over. He is coming right in. You know, Perry. You're hard to get along with. As long as my clients get a square deal. Your clients can rely on you to get them a square deal. Hello Bill. This is Mr Foley one of the parties to the controversy. You know Mr Mason of course. - Hello Perry. Who are the witnesses? Arthur Cartwright. Who claims the dog howls. There is Cartwright's housekeeper. She may claim she heard the dog howl. But you'll find she's as deaf as a post and couldn't hear thunder. Then there is my wife. Though she is ill in bed. But she can talk to you. She knows the dog is as quiet as a mouse. Then there's Miss Benton. My housekeeper. How about the dog himself? He'd have something to say about it. You will find him a willing witness. - Okay. Come on, gentlemen. Goodbye, sir. - Mr Foley. Room for three cars I see. Going to drive them all yourself? Why do you ask that? - You say your chauffeur left last week. Not that it concerns you. I'm putting in an addition to my garage because I happen to want it that way. Any objections? - None at all. Who do we talk to first? - Suit yourself. I think after you talk to my wife you needn't bother with other witnesses. We can go in here. Mr Foley. I must see you at once. We've had some trouble. My housekeeper. What happened? - Prince bit me. How did it happen? I don't know. I think he was poisoned. He acted sick and I forced him to swallow some salt for an emetic. Then he bit me. - Bad? I don't think so. Not unless he is going mad. I shut him up in your bathroom. He is better now. Miss Benton. This is Mr Pemberton. The deputy sheriff. This is Mr Mason. A lawyer. These gentlemen are investigating charges made by neighbors about the dog. Just a moment. Let me do the talking. You have a police dog on the premises named Prince? Yes, sir. - And has he been howling? Howling? No, sir. He barked once yesterday when a pedlar came to the door. But there's been no howling. You're sure about that? Positive. - You see? If you talk with my wife I'm sure you'll be satisfied the charges are false. Your wife isn't here, Mr Foley. - Isn't here? She can't have gone out. She has been very ill. I know. But she went just the same. She packed a suitcase and took a taxi. She left a note for you. - Where is it? Upstairs in her room. On the dresser. Excuse me for just a moment please. - Sure. Go right ahead. Was there any trouble between you and Mrs Foley just before she left? Certainly not. And furthermore, it is not any of your business. That's for you. What do you think of that girl? She's tried to make herself up to look as ugly as possible. Rather young for a housekeeper, don't you think? Gossiping are you, Mason? No. Just speculating. That's all. Well, it's all over. You can call off your little investigation. Is something wrong? My wife has run away with another man. It may interest you to know that the man she left with is Arthur Cartwright. The fellow next door who raises such a fuss about the howling dog. His complaint was a trick to get me out of the way so he can carry out his plan. That shows you were wrong when you accuse him of being crazy. Keep your remarks to yourself. I am here representing Cartwright. You can't bluff me, Foley. Just a minute, folks. Let's not fly off the handle. You have plenty of work to do for your client, Mr Mason. I'll get out a warrant for his arrest. That's up to the district attorney. How do you know your wife left with Cartwright? She says so in this note. Here. Read it. 'Dear Clinton'. 'A few days ago I found out who was living next door'. 'I know now I have always loved him and not you'. 'I am going away with him'. 'I know we will be happy. Evelyn'. Short and sweet, isn't it? - Yes. There is something about that letter that I don't quite understand. Look here. That man has broken up my home. He tricked me and betrayed me and he's going to pay for it. I'll catch him and prosecute him on every charge within the law. If it takes every cent I have I'll make him pay for what he's done to me. That's up to you, Mr Foley. You can talk to the DA's office and you can put private detectives on his trail. Do you mind if I use your telephone? You can use the telephone and then you can get out. Thanks for the invitation. Where is it? I'll show you. Goodbye, Sheriff. Sorry to have caused you this trouble. - Not at all. I'm sure the district attorney's office will cooperate in every way. Good day. - Good day. How would you like to make 20 dollars in a hurry? Mr Foley said you may use the phone. And then you were to leave. Wheeler talking. Yes, chief? Stand by all of you. Important. Throw everything else overboard. I'll be there in half an hour. Right, chief. Something hot is coming up. - Yeah? If you can find a photograph of the woman who left with Mr Cartwright .. It might even be worth 25 dollars. Why would you want a picture of Mr Foley's wife? Excuse me. Did I say his wife? Never mind. I'll probably be able to pick one up at Mr Cartwright's home next door. Thank you. What do you want? - I want Mr Cartwright. I can't hear you. You have to speak a little louder. Where is Mr Cartwright? I am his lawyer, Mr Mason. His lawyer? He went out last night at half past ten and didn't come back. Did he take a suitcase? - No. Did he take his car? No. He hasn't a car. - Where did he go? I don't know. Look here. I have to find Mr Cartwright and you have to help me. I don't know anything about it. He went out and he didn't come back. Where he went is none of my business. I clean up the house for him. That's all. I am deaf and I can't keep track of what's going on. What is your name? How long have you known Mr Cartwright? Elisabeth Walker. I've worked for him for two months. How long would you stay if Mr Cartwright didn't return? I'll stay until my time is up. When will that be? That is my business, mister lawyer. Make a note on these instructions, Della. Something important, chief? - Not sure yet, boys. It's a very puzzling situation. I want you to find everything you can about Mr and Mrs Clinton Foley. Living at 4889 Milpas Drive. Check on their housekeeper Lucy Benton while you are about it. Also, get me any dope you can on Arthur Cartwright living next door to them. At 4893. Find out where they came from. Their past history. Don't spare expenses. What's the low-down? - That's what I can't figure. I represent Cartwright. In a matter that began with a howling dog. I think there's something fishy about the whole business. Cartwright has disappeared. Foley claims he ran off with Mrs Foley. I want the facts of the case as soon as you can get them. Check, chief. A straight message. That will be 45 cents and two cents tax please. Thank you. Well, we got it. - Good. We had to burn up the wires. We got some outside agencies working on the case. Never mind that. Let's have the dope. The woman living with Foley on Milpas Drive isn't his wife. I had an idea she wasn't. As a matter of fact, she's the wife of Arthur Cartwright. The wife of Arthur Cartwright? This is interesting. Mrs and Mrs Foley lived at Santa Barbara. They were friendly with Mr and Mrs Cartwright. About a year ago Foley skipped out with Mrs Cartwright. It was quite a scandal. Foley's wife Bessie was broken-hearted. Cartwright said he'd get his wife back if it took him the rest of his life. He traced Foley and Evelyn Cartwright two months ago and moved in next door. And now Foley is accusing Cartwright of running away with his own wife. Get Foley on the phone. Get me Foley at his house. Foley has a reputation of being a pretty rough customer. That's swell. I'm a fool for a fight myself. There is your call. Mr Foley. This is Perry Mason. The attorney. I want to talk to you. No? Perhaps you'd better change your mind. This is about the affairs of a client. Who lived at Santa Barbara. A married woman. Her husband ran off and left her about a year ago. He ran away with another man's wife. Yes. I thought you would see me. Tonight at eight? Sharp. Now then. What about this Benton woman? Foley's housekeeper. I checked on her. She was Foley's private secretary in Santa Barbara. When Foley took off with Mrs Cartwright he took Benton along as his housekeeper. The man travelled in style. Didn't Mrs Cartwright object? From the dope I get Mrs Cartwright never knew Benton worked for Foley before. As his secretary. I see. What about Bessie Foley? We haven't got a line on her yet. Okay. Ed, get busy on her. Find her for me. Right, chief. - Della. You stay around here tonight. I'll want you later. Yes, sir. George, go to Foley's home. Stay out of sight but keep your eyes open. Check all that goes on. - Check. I'll be there at eight. That is the one. The house next door. Yes, ma'am. So it's you. You found me. Yes. I have found you. - Well, what do you want? Justice. Nonsense. You've broken into my home like a common intruder. I'm going to treat you like one. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] Where is he? There is nobody home. I knocked and knocked. Never mind. Take me to 9th and Olive. Yes, ma'am. Give me police headquarters. Give me Captain Kelly in homicide. Hello Captain. Perry Mason. I'm talking from the home of Clinton Foley. At 4889 Milpas Drive. Foley's been murdered. Repeat that number. 4-8-8-9. Milpas. Stay right there. Don't touch anything. I'll send Sergeant Holcomb out with the homicide squad right away. Dobbs. Dobbs. Yes, chief? Get out of the neighborhood as fast as you can. Keep out of sight and your mouth shut until you see me. Check. Make it snappy. Here they come. I'm Detective Sergeant Holcomb. Where is the body? One moment, Sergeant. I'll take charge. The D.A. himself on the job. Hello Claude. Hello Perry. I thought I'd look into this case personally. Yes. I believe the next election isn't far off. Assign your men. Canvas the area. Question everyone. Hold anyone who can't give a satisfactory account of himself. You three stick with me. - Come along. Here you are. I had an appointment with Foley at 8 o'clock this evening. I found the door open. I rang the bell. No-one answered so I walked in and .. Found Foley dead. You are sure you're not holding anything back, Perry? Are you insinuating I might have shot Foley? How do we know you didn't? I know you represent a client who had trouble with Foley. That's an idea. Maybe he's trying to cover up for him. Maybe I'm trying to cover up for myself. I begin to think so. Why don't you arrest me? Maybe I will if you don't come clean on this thing. 'Dear Clinton. For my sake don't do anything that will cause more scandal'. 'Stop'. 'It won't do any good and will us all harm'. 'Evelyn'. Mind if I see that? It's quite possible that your client Arthur Cartwright really did do the job. I understand he ran away with Foley's wife. She told him a story of abuse. Cartwright worked himself up to a murderous pitch just as Foley feared. The dog tried to protect his master and was shot. Then Cartwright killed Foley. What about that theory? Why not find Cartwright and ask him? You've probably got him pretty well hidden by now. Why don't you cooperate with us? If you'll stop this third-degree hokum I might. Come along. Here is where the dog was chained. There is a clasp lock that fastens on the dog's collar. Well? There is shaving lather on this towel. What about it? In my opinion. This towel was dropped when Foley released the dog from the chain. When a man shaves he does not put shaving cream on a towel. He only gets shaving cream on a towel .. When he wipes the lather from his face. If Arthur Cartwright wanted to kill Foley. He'd have come here and blazed away: Bang, bang - without any conversation. But that isn't how it happened. You're talking in circles. What you trying to do, kid us? No. I'm trying to explain about the lather on the towel. Right now, we don't care about the lather on the towel. What we care about is Arthur Cartwright. Where is he? I don't know. Of course not. Look here. The coroner's physician says Foley died not more than an hour ago. All you have to do is to show where Cartwright was between seven and eight. And he'll be out of it as a suspect. Claude, I've already told you that I don't know where Cartwright is. Look here. You talk as though I were an accessory after the fact in this murder. He thinks you are holding out on us. And so do I. Mason, you have a reputation as one of the shrewdest lawyers in the country. Thank you. But even the cleverest lawyer sometimes puts his foot into it. Meaning that you're through asking me questions for the time being? That's it. Goodnight, gentlemen. Any time I can be of service .. Lather on a towel. He knows plenty. Sergeant, I want you to shadow Mason. He's up to something. I want to know what it is. I'll instruct my office to use every effort to locate the Cartwrights. You are right, chief. Cartwright is the guy. This is the taxi stand where that driver hangs out. What number? - 545. There it is. You busy? No, sir. Where to? Anywhere. Just drive around. Okay. My meter is running. It's alright. You'll get paid for your meter and a nice top on top of that. What's the gag? - I'm an attorney. I am trying to run down a little information for one of my clients. You drove a woman to 4889 Milpas Drive this evening. What about it? - What did she look like? She was about medium size. Wore a black fur coat. Kind-of a good-looker. Dark eyes. Had on some kind of perfume that smelled great. She left her handkerchief in the car. Here it is. Take a whiff of that. Very nice. I think I know the brand. Bellog?. - Yeah. Well, still smells good to me. What else did you notice about her? - She had a peculiar voice. That's all I noticed about her except that she was wearing black gloves. What happened when you got to the house? She asked me to go next door and deliver a message. I was to ask for Arthur and tell him to go to Clinton Foley's house right away. Because Bessie was having a showdown. Did you deliver the message? - No. I kept pounding but nobody answered. So finally I took my passenger back to where I picked her up. I hope you don't turn this handkerchief in to the lost-and-found for a while. I have an idea this woman will show up and ask for it. When she does, get her name and address. We got to do that anyhow. We got to make a report to the company on everything we find in the cab. A police car is trailing us. Here. Here's a 20-dollar bill. Drive us round the next corner as fast as you can and let us out. Then you are to drive as far as that money will take the cab. Another car is going to follow you. Don't stop for it. And don't let them catch you until you are good and ready. It sounds screwy to me. But you're paying for it. Alright. That clears up your report on the yellow cab. Probably, the reason you didn't hear the shots .. Was because the driver was pounding on Cartwright's door. Probably so. And the radio was playing so loud too. What about Lucy Benton? She left at 7:15. A man called for her in a Chevy coup?. The license number was .. 6M. 9-2-4-5. Alright. Then what? Then the taxi cab that you know about. Then nothing happened until you showed up at one minute to eight. Fine. Here is what I want you to do. A telegram was sent from Ventura to Clinton Foley. It's supposed to have been written by the woman who posed as Foley's wife. I want a photostatic copy of that original telegram. That's a pretty hard job. Never mind how much of a job it is. I want you to get it. Check. Hello? Miss Street? Give me the chief. Yes. Just a moment. Wheeler. - Yes? Breedmont Hotel. 9th and Olive. Room 864. And the name is .. Mrs C.M. Dangerfield. Mrs C.M. Dangerfield. Right. Dangerfield? Who's that? That is the name under which Bessie Foley .. Is registered at the Breedmont Hotel. What will you do? You and I make a social call on a lady. Who may be arrested at any moment on a charge of murdering her husband. Let's go. Who is it? An attorney. Very important. - I don't want to see anyone. Come on, Della. Leave this room at once. - Close the door, Della. Leave or I call the police. - Don't bother. The police will be here soon enough, Mrs Foley. What do you mean? Sit down and listen. Cut out the monkey business. Do as he tells you. It's for your own good. I know all about you. Don't deny anything. Don't go into hysterics. Your husband deserted you for another woman. Mrs Evelyn Cartwright. You and Cartwright found them. Foley has been murdered. Murdered? Yes. I specialise in murder cases. My name is Perry Mason. Perry Mason? I am so glad to see you. Yes. I thought you would be. Listen. I don't you to try to explain anything to me yet. Cartwright made a will leaving you his property. He retained me to see that your legal rights were safeguarded. He named me in his will? I don't understand. Don't waste time. I have got my fee and I propose to earn it. But if you don't want my services just say so and I walk out of here right now. Please don't do that. I want your services. I need help. Alright. If anyone questions you. About where you were. At any time tonight or what you were doing. Tell them you cannot answer questions unless your attorney is present. That sounds simple but it may be harder to do than you realise. Suppose they ask .. If they ask you what the weather is. If they ask you hold old you are. If they ask you what kind of face cream you use or anything else. Make the same answer. You cannot answer any questions unless your attorney is present. I understand. Yes, that is it. That's the perfume. Come here, Della. What are you doing? That cost a lot of money. It's liable to cost you everything you've got if you're not careful. Buy yourself some other distinctly different perfume. Sprinkle it over everything you've got. What else? - Check out of this hotel. Go to the Broadway Hotel on 5th Street. Register under your right name. And be careful not to leave a back trail to this place. Are these the things you were wearing? - Yes. I want to borrow them for a while. Here, Della. Slip this on. You can't take my things. I said I only want to borrow them for a while. Della, these too. Now please do as I say and don't argue. Not that I'm guilty of anything but you seem to think .. I'm in a hurry. Don't answer any questions unless I am present. Goodbye. Come on, Della. I'm afraid you're skating on pretty thin ice, Mr Mason. I haven't fallen through yet. Will you skate with me? It's dangerous. - Will you take a chance? You know I will. Alright. Let's see if you can impersonate Mrs Foley. Pardon me. Didn't I leave my handkerchief in your taxi cab? Yes, I guess you did. May I have it please? - Sure. Where was it I took you? - Milpas Drive. That's right. That sure is nifty smelling stuff you use, lady. What's your name and address? I have to inform the lost and found department. Mrs Clinton Foley. Broadway Hotel. Foley? F-O-L-E-Y? Yes. Okay, lady. Not following me are you, Sergeant? - Nope. Just out for a little walk. - So I see. It's lucky I ran into you. I have a little something for you. It might be important evidence. First it was a towel. Now it's a handkerchief. What's this to do with the case? It was left in Yellow Cab 545. By a woman who went to Clinton Foley's house at seven o'clock this evening. I thought you'd be interested. You bet your neck I am. How did you get hold of this? I'm not at liberty to explain that. You can get the information from the taxi driver. Now see here, Mason. - See here yourself, Holcomb. An attorney is supposed to guard the confidences of his client. I know the rights and liabilities of an attorney. You can't drag anything more out of me. You've got the handkerchief so .. Goodnight, Sergeant. Broadway Hotel and make it snappy. Tell me just what happened this evening when you went to see your husband. How did you know I went there? It's my business to know things. Give me the details. When I got to the house the door was locked. I had a passkey. How did you get that? Please don't ask me that. I wanted to see Clinton. Without giving him a chance to prepare for my visit. Go on. We had a few words. He let his dog loose. Suddenly there was a shot. The dog was killed. Clinton rushed in. There was another shot and he fell dead. Who fired the shots? I don't know. Was there anyone in the room besides yourself and Mr Foley? I didn't see anyone. Could someone have been concealed in the room? Either that, or someone might have fired the shots through the garden door. Was the door open? - Yes. It closed right after the shots were fired. What did you do? All I could think of was running away. I knew I may be suspected of having done the shooting. I suppose you have no way of showing that you didn't do it? No. A gun was found lying on the floor. Was it your gun? No. Did you ever have a gun like it? No. I never saw the gun. I had nothing to do with it. Why don't you believe me? I'm telling the truth. Alright. We'll let it go at that. What happened next? I had sent the taxi driver next door to call Arthur Cartwright. But he wasn't home. I was panic stricken. I went out and had the driver take me back to the vicinity of my hotel. I figured that nobody would ever be able to trace me. I don't know how you found out about it. Did you know you left a handkerchief behind in the taxi cab? Good heavens, no. Where is it? The police have it. I gave it to them. I thought you were acting as my lawyer. They can trace me through that handkerchief. That's alright. They'll trace you anyway. And they're going to question you. You can't afford to lie to them and you can't afford to tell them the truth. You are in a jam and you've got to keep quiet. Do you understand that? That prejudices everyone against me. It will make everyone think I'm guilty. The newspapers will say I refused to talk. Don't worry about that. You can tell the police and the reporters that you want to talk. But that I won't let you. Say you can explain everything if only I would permit you to tell your story. You could even call me up on the telephone. In their presence. And plead with me for permission to talk. Put it on big. I'll sit tight and say that the minute you say anything. You'll have to get another lawyer. Do you think I'll be arrested? Certainly you'll be arrested. You let yourself into your husband's house with a passkey. You were there when he was murdered. You did not notify the police. You registered at a hotel under an assumed name. Now, if you think you can pull that off and not go to police HQ you're crazy. I don't think I can stand it. How soon before they come for me? [ Door knocks ] Right now. Open up in there. We are officers. Open up there. No. Let me go. - That won't do you any good. Get a grip on yourself. If you can keep your head I can do you some good. Ready now. Chin up. [ Door knocks ] What are you doing here? - Talking with my client, Mrs Foley. Wife of Clinton Foley. Does that answer your question? - You bet your neck it does. I know now where you got that handkerchief. Mrs Foley, you are under arrest. Charged with the murder of your husband. I must warn you anything you say may be used against you. It's alright, Sergeant. She won't say anything. Don't bother, Sergeant. It's not the same perfume. You would see to that alright. Hello there, Sergeant. I missed you when I got home last night. I expected to find you peeping in my window. Well, mister wise-guy. If you knew what I know you might not be so sure of yourself. I'll bite. What do you know? We've positively identified the gun found at Foley's house. The gun that killed Foley and his police dog. Very interesting. How did you do that? We traced the serial numbers and got a report on its sale. We know definitely who bought that gun. Alright, Sergeant. You tell me. Who bought it? It was bought by Bessie Foley in Santa Barbara. Two days before her husband ran away with Evelyn Cartwright. What do you think about that? That's the best news I've heard today. Keep up the good work, Sergeant. Hello, Mr Mason. - How do you do, Mrs Foley. Police Sergeant Holcomb has traced that gun to you. Why did you lie to me about it? I didn't lie. I just forgot. Then let's see if you can remember. Two days before my husband left Santa Barbara. I found out about his affair with Evelyn Cartwright. I went to a sporting goods store and bought the automatic. What did you intend to do with it? Use it on your husband? I don't know. Perhaps you intended to use it on Mrs Cartwright? I don't know, I tell you. I acted on an impulse. What happened to the gun? My husband took it away from me. I took it out of my purse and told him I'd rather kill myself .. Than be known as a wife who can't keep a husband. But you didn't kill yourself. - I don't think I really intended to. Anyway, he took it away from me and I haven't seen it since. Your idea is that someone got possession of the gun and committed the crime? Yes. How about Lucy Benton the housekeeper? Why should she want to kill him? - I don't know. Why should anyone want to kill him? The fact remains that he's dead and you are charged with committing the murder. You don't act as if you believe what I told you about the gun. I never believe anything I can't make a jury believe. I'm not at all sure I can make a jury believe your story about that gun. I want to tell you something. My husband was cruel. Unprincipled. He humiliated me through his affairs with other women. Do you want me to help convict you or defend you? Goodbye, Mrs Foley. And remember. No-one ever got in trouble by not talking too much. Wheeler, as soon as that stuff is ready, bring it in. Alright. Now let's check and see where we stand. How about this phoney housekeeper, Miss Benton? She has an alibi covering every minute of her time since she left the house. You must find a hole in it if you can. Who's the man who called for her in the coup? on the evening of the murder? I have a line on him too. His name is Carl Trask. He was Foley's chauffeur. He has something of a police record too. Good. Crack down on him. Find out if he saw Miss Benton on the day after the killing. Check. These are the samples of handwriting you asked for. This is Mrs Foley's handwriting. This is Mrs Cartwright's. And this is some stuff the Benton dame wrote. Where's the copy of the note that Mrs Cartwright left for Foley? It's in your cabinet. Also, the telegram sent from Ventura. None of them match. Even a handwriting expert couldn't find any resemblance. We have to do something. In a minute I'll get a hunch. Remember, the Benton woman was bitten by Foley's police dog. Is her hand still bandaged? - Yes. Hand, wrist and elbow. I checked on her at the Riverview apartments early this morning. Della, ring up the Riverview apartments and get Miss Benton on the wire. Riverview apartments? It's The Chronicle calling. Miss Benton. - The city editor. Miss Benton? Yes. Miss Benton speaking. This is The Chronicle. The city editor's desk. The Chronicle? Yes. City editor. Hello Miss Benton. It looks like there will be a lot of .. Dramatic interest in the Foley murder case. You've been with the people concerned for a long time. Did you keep a diary? Why do you ask? Here is why I am asking. In case you did keep a diary .. We're prepared to pay you $10,000 for the exclusive right to publish it. Ten thousand dollars? Yes. Of course I'm interested. Keep it right up to date, will you. Don't say anything about this offer. I'll have one of our reporters get in touch with you in a few days. Of course, we have to see it before we close the deal. Certainly. I understand. That's all. Goodbye. Do you think she did keep a diary? I don't know. She said she did. That wouldn't mean anything. The way I made the offer she'll have time to fake one. A girl can do a lot of writing for ten thousand dollars. I'm beginning to see daylight in this case. I think I'm about ready to go to trial. I propose to show. That on the night of the 17th June of this year. Clinton Foley was shot to death by the defendant in this case. I expect to prove that she used a passkey .. To gain entrance to her husband's house. And shot him down in cold blood. I propose to show that she inadvertently left a handkerchief. In the taxi cab which took her to the scene of the crime. That recognising the danger of leaving behind so deadly a clue .. She found the driver of the taxi cab and had the handkerchief returned to her. Does the counsellor for the defense wish to make an opening address at this time? No, Your Honor. You're certain that it was the defendant in this case who hired your taxi cab? Yes, sir. - You are positive .. That it was the defendant to whom you returned the handkerchief? Yes. I am sure of that. And you are just as certain. That the woman who called for the handkerchief .. Was the same woman who hired you to take her out to Milpas Drive? Yes, sir. That is the woman. Della Street. Will you please stand up. Take a look at this lady and tell me if you've ever seen her before. Your Honor, I object to this form of testing the recollection of the witness. It is improper examination. You intend to connect it up, counsellor? I'll do better than that. I'll withdraw the question as it was asked. And ask you, Samuel Martin. Is not the woman now standing in the courtroom .. The same woman who called for her handkerchief .. Which had been left in your taxi cab on the evening of June 17th? No, sir. It was the defendant. You couldn't possibly be mistaken? No, sir. I'm not mistaken about either of them. Remember you are testifying under oath. Now, are you absolutely certain? That this woman is not the woman who called for and received from you .. The handkerchief which has been introduced as evidence in this case. Maybe I'm not so sure. If you can be mistaken about the woman who gave you the handkerchief. You can also be mistaken about the identity of your passenger. Well, if I can be mistaken on one I might be mistaken on the other. Are you mistaken or are you not mistaken? I don't know. That is all. Your Honor, may I ask for a recess until tomorrow morning? Yes. The court will adjourn until ten o'clock tomorrow morning. During the recess. The jury is admonished not to talk about the case among themselves. Nor to permit it to be discussed in their presence. Alright, Mrs Foley. Get Miss Street. Bring her to me. Miss Street. The district attorney would like to talk to you. The district attorney must wait. Judge Markham wants to see you all in his chambers. Drumm, will you come with me into the judge's chambers? Very well. Sit down, would you. Gentlemen. Judge, this young woman is a witness for the defense. I saw these two deputies approach her at a signal from the district attorney. Will you please instruct the prosecution not to annoy her. Alright. Since you brought the subject up. And since court is not in session we'll settle it right here and now. Fine. Go ahead and settle it. Your Honor, I meant to find out from this woman .. Who influenced her to impersonate the defendant. And to claim a handkerchief left in Sam Martin's taxi cab. An underhanded device meant to discredit the entire testimony of the taxi driver. Alright. I did that. What will you do about it? That's what I try to determine now. It seems to me that this discussion is resolving itself into a personal issue. Judge, the only way I can prove the defendant was at the scene of the crime. Is through her positive identification by the taxi driver. The court isn't called upon at this time .. To pass on the ethics of the question. I must be assured that this witness will not be terrified by a lot of bullies. Your request is in order. Mr Drumm. You will refrain from intimidating witnesses subpoenaed by the defense. Yes, sir. They will get you before the Grievance Committee of the Bar. That is very kind of him. Mason has got Drumm's goat. I'll stick around until they come out of the judge's chambers. I'll call you back. Don't get excited. You'll only get your picture in the paper. Go ahead. You deliberately planned this just to get a dramatic story on the front page. Any objections? Lots of them. Then let me give you a little tip. Just be careful how you make them. Hold that. Go on. Fight him, Drumm. Got everything you want, boys? - Okay, Perry. Give me a ring if you ever get picked up for murder. Got you worried, haven't they chief. - Yes. A little. You see, there are only three keys to the successful outcome of this trial. What are they? One is the identification of a certain handwriting. The hand that wrote Mrs Cartwright's letter of farewell to Foley. And also wrote the telegram sent from Ventura. The second is the howling dog. Still harping on that dog? I thought you'd forgotten about it. No. Somehow, I'm going to prove that the dog did howl. But that can come later. Yeah. But the dog is dead. Nevertheless. When the time comes I will have to prove that the dog howled. You said there were three things. What is the third? We have to find out what happened to Mr and Mrs Cartwright. They've disappeared. The district attorney's office is making every effort to locate them. We have to find them first. And beat the prosecution to their testimony. What do you want us to do, chief? - Find them. We'll do our best. You can bank on that. Before you check on them. Let's concentrate on this handwriting. Now. I'm going to take a chance on you going to jail. Yeah? How? I want you to call on Lucy Benton. Tell her you are reporters from The Chronicle. You have an okay to pay her $10,000 for an exclusive right to publish her diary. She may or may not have someone with her. Of course, she won't let you have the diary until the money is paid. But she'll let you look at it. You want us to grab the diary? No. I want you to turn to the page marked June 18th. And tear the page from the book. I want that page if you've got to fight your way out. Alright. Page June 18th. We're on our way, chief. There's a lot about you in the papers. Good? Not all of it. You get a lot of credit for making the taxi driver look like a liar. What is the bad part? There it is. A front page editorial in The Tribune. It criticises you for not letting Mrs Foley take the stand. It declares you jeopardise the freedom of a woman who may be innocent. How do you feel about it? I ask you as a personal favor to please let Mrs Foley take the witness stand. This editorial isn't the only thing. I've heard lots of talk. What kind of talk? Everyone thinks she is innocent now. The case against her is all circumstantial evidence. All she has to do is .. Deny the murder charges and give an explanation. And the jury votes not guilty. Suppose Mrs Foley tells her story on the witness stand. And then is convicted. - But she couldn't be. Everybody sympathises with her. Now the evidence from the taxi driver has blown up there is nothing to it. You know, there is a rumor that Cartwright killed Foley. And you're protecting him because of a large fee he paid you. Della, for once and for all. I'll not let Mrs Foley take the witness stand under any circumstances. I'm not letting this diary out of my hands until I get $10,000 in cash. We are only reporters, Miss. The city editor said he'd send you a check as soon as he looks it over. He wants to be satisfied that the diary is interesting enough to publish. And don't forget. $10,000 is a lot of money. Nothing you can say will make me change my mind. When I get the cash, you get the diary. In that case, will you just let me glance through it? To get an idea what it's like. If it reads okay I call the editor and he sends the money over by messenger. Go ahead. Let him take a look at it. What can you lose? Ten thousand bucks is a lot of dough for a little scribbling. Alright. You may read a little of it. What are you doing? Give me that. - Take it easy, sister. Do something. Don't let him get away with it. Come on, guys. Kick back with the paper. Reporters? They're detectives. What's the excitement? You're not afraid of anything, are you? Come on. Don't stall. Hand it over. Just a minute. What's your name? My name is Carl Trask but that has nothing to do with it. Carl Trask, huh? - You heard me. You want this piece of paper? Yeah. I want it in a hurry. Carl Trask, huh? Here's a piece of paper that's just as good. Read it over carefully. I told you they weren't reporters. - Hey. What is this? A subpoena? You guessed it, brother. Be in court at ten o'clock in the morning. What's the big idea? I'm not in on this. That's what you think. - Come back. I'll make more trouble for you than you ever had in your lives. Come back here. And now, in reference to Mr Foley's police dog, Prince. Was the dog devoted to Evelyn Cartwright? Yes. He had become very attached to him. The dog was also devoted to Mrs Foley? Naturally. He'd been with Mr and Mrs Foley for years. The dog had also become attached to you. Yes. He had a very affectionate disposition. Yes. I can understand that. And the dog howled almost continuously .. During the nights of the 15th and 16th of June of the present year? He did not. Did you hear the dog howl? - I did not. Is it not a fact that the dog left the house .. Stood near to the garage that was under construction and howled dismally? He did not. May it please the court. The defense at this time would like to make a motion. For an adjournment of the court officers and witnesses to the scene of the crime. At 4889 Milpas drive. For further cross examination of this witness. This is a most unusual motion. Unusual, Your Honor. But not necessarily irregular. It's only at the Foley residence that the defense can hope to introduce .. New and important evidence. Physically impossible to bring in to this court. Does the prosecution wish to enter any objections? On the contrary. The prosecution feels that a visit to the scene of the crime .. May be of great benefit to the jury in arriving at a verdict. Motion granted. Bailiff. Take charge of the jury. What do you suppose this is all about? - That's just a grandstand play. Drumm has Mason running for cover. As I understand your testimony. Evelyn Cartwright left this residence in a taxi cab on the morning of June 17th. Yes. That is correct. You saw her leave. Yes. Do I understand that you saw Mrs Cartwright alive .. On the morning of June 17th of this year? Your Honor. That pounding is driving me crazy. I can scarcely think. Bailiff. Will you please see that noise is stopped. The witness will answer the last question. I cannot say that I saw her personally. I heard steps going down the stairs from her room. I was here in the living room. I glanced out and I saw a taxi cab drawn up by the front door. I saw a woman get in the cab and drive away. I took it for granted that woman was Mrs Cartwright. Then you're not sure the woman who drove away in the taxi cab was Mrs Cartwright? No. I am not sure. You've identified this letter as being in the handwriting of Mrs Cartwright. Will you identify this photostat copy of a telegram .. As also being in Mrs Cartwright's handwriting? Don't you know? You unhesitatingly .. Identified this letter as being in Mrs Cartwright's handwriting. Now, what about this telegram? Yes. It's the same. Bailiff. Go and see what happened to that other officer. I want that noise stopped. - Yes, sir. Miss Benton. You'll have to speak loudly enough for the jury to understand you. What's all this noise out here? The judge wants it stopped. Mrs Cartwright sent this telegram from Ventura on June 17th. I guess so. Kindly explain how Mrs Cartwright wrote a letter and telegram on June 17th. When you know in your own knowledge. That she was murdered on the evening of June 15th. As you also know that her husband Arthur Cartwright .. Was murdered in this house on the following night. That is objected to as argumentative and calling for a conclusion of the witness. Not proper cross-examination and assuming a fact not in evidence. Objection sustained. Didn't you write that letter? No. That handwriting doesn't resemble mine in the least. Yes. On June 17th of this year. Your hand was in a bandage, wasn't it? Yes. You had been bitten by a dog. Yes. Prince had been poisoned. When I tried to give him an emetic .. He accidentally bit my hand. You right hand was bandaged from June 17th until several days thereafter. Yes. You could not hold a pen in that hand. No. No. Of course I couldn't.. That shows how false your accusation is that I wrote the letter of the telegram. My hand was so crippled I could not possibly have held a pen in it. Exactly. Were you in Ventura on June 17th of this year? Didn't you go to Ventura on June 17th in an automobile driven by Carl Trask? Yes. I thought I might find Mrs Cartwright in Ventura. And didn't you file this telegram while you were there? No. You know that was impossible. You just testified you couldn't possibly have held a pen in your right hand. From the 17th day of June until several days thereafter. Is that not true? Yes. - Very well. Is it not a fact that you kept a diary over the period I have mentioned? Yes. No. Isn't this a page from your diary? Which you wrote on June 18th? Is it not a fact, Lucy Benton, that you are ambidextrous? That you've always been able to write equally well with either hand? And that you use your left hand .. Whenever you wish to disguise your handwriting? Is it not a fact that the handwriting on this page from your diary .. Is identical with the handwriting on this letter? And this telegram? Purported to have been written by Mrs Cartwright. Your Honor. They just dug up two bodies out in the garage. Buried under the cement. You were right. It's Arthur Cartwright and his wife. Both shot in the head. Cartwright? Your Honor. Your Honor. In the name of common decency I demand an adjournment. Granted. The court recommends the district attorney takes the proper steps .. To verify this witness's connection with the murders of Mr and Mrs Cartwright. I am sorry Mrs Foley that you've had such an ordeal. I don't think it will be long now. It is the contention of the prosecution. That the shots that killed Clinton Foley were fired by his wife, the defendant. There is one unanswerable objection to such a theory. That is, that if the killer had been the defendant. The police dog, which also met its death. Would not have rushed upon the defendant. It would not have been necessary for the defendant .. To have shot the dog. And why? Because the dog knew the defendant and loved her. The dog would never have rushed upon the defendant under any circumstances. On the contrary. The dog would have been overjoyed at seeing the defendant. And knowing that the two persons. To whom it was most devoted had been reunited. That, ladies and gentlemen. Disposes of the case of the prosecution. Take your time. I'm in no hurry. Shut up while I am thinking. No? Well, just a second. Oh. Found me. What do you suppose Mason wants with that pooch? I wonder. Say. Do you suppose .. How did you guess that the bodies of Arthur Cartwright and his wife .. Were buried under the garage? Arthur Cartwright told the truth. When he said the dog howled on the night of June 15th. Between the time that Cartwright came here to see me. And later wrote his will. He somehow discovered that his wife was dead. That's why he changed his will. Leaving his property to Bessie Foley instead of his wife. And you think it was Foley who killed Evelyn Cartwright? Unquestionably. Mrs Cartwright discovered .. That Foley and his so-called housekeeper, Miss Benton. Were in love. They'd probably been quarrelling about it for days. It was a premeditated crime. Otherwise, why should Foley have built an unnecessary addition to his garage? When Cartwright faced them with his suspicions. They had to commit a second crime to cover up the first. Then it was Foley who killed both Mr and Mrs Cartwright? Yes. I beg your pardon. Am I intruding? Not at all. I was waiting for you. Prince. Prince. Hello. I beg your pardon. But his name is not Prince. Prince dead. Down, Prince. Down. I urge you not to call him Prince. Where did you get him? I couldn't understand why the dog suddenly stopped howling. And why an apparently friendly animal should savagely attack Lucy Benton. So I made a round of the kennels in the neighbourhood. I found one kennel. Where a man answering the description of Clinton Foley. Had exchanged a police dog on the night of June 16th .. For another police dog of similar appearance. I purchased this dog. What will you do with him? I would suggest you take him with you. Keep me advised of your whereabouts. And remember. Don't answer any questions. Thank you. Thank you. Come on, boy. That was the dog that howled. The only argument you had to convince the jury of Mrs Foley's innocence .. Was that her own dog would never have attacked her. She would never have had to shoot him. It means that .. That woman actually did .. I have never heard Mrs Foley's story and nor has anyone else. But I'm convinced anything she did was done in self-defense. She had to defend herself against a savage dog and a murderous man. I acted merely as her lawyer. They'll get her and try her over again. - No they won't. She has faced a jury and been once in jeopardy. She could never be tried for that offense again. You are a cross between a saint and a devil. How do you like it? ..f-s..
