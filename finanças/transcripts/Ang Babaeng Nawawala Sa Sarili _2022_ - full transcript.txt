--== McEphie ==-- Go ahead, Albina, you may proceed. Doc, Doc, help me. Someone wants to get inside of me. She wants to destroy my life. Who is she? Do you know her? Who wants to get inside of your body? Doc! Doc, she's already inside of me. Doc, help me! Doc! Doc! - Doc, help me! - Take her to the recreation area. Doc! Let me go! Help me! Someone wants to get my body! Hi. Albina Tamayo? Yes, I am. This is my set card. Let's go. Follow me. Is this your first time in modeling? In a fashion house, yes. But I did hand modeling before. If you do good, great opportunities await you. I really hope I get in. Can I ask a question? For what fashion house is this? It's Manos. They're not that big in the Philippines but they are thriving in Shanghai. We will contact you once the client makes his decision. Thank you. You're welcome. Don't bail on me! Of course! See you. Let me drive you home. Babe, talk to me. Please. Can you stop? I'm not your girlfriend anymore. Babe, let me explain. Please. What do you want? You wasted six years, Wendell. You cheater! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Fuck you! Babe... Wendell dropped by earlier. Did you see each other? He didn't know you had a go-see, did he? Your boyfriend should know your whereabouts. Oh! Who brought these flowers? It's from Wendell. Just use it as an offering. Dear, what's wrong? Why are you being so pushy? Wendell and I already broke up. Oh, dear. Dear, are you going to waste those years just because of one mistake? You should be more understanding, Albina. Wendell's a good guy. Albina? Albina, what is happening to you? Wake up, Albina. Albina, wake up. Wake up. Here. Go to sleep. Stacey, who's that guy? I don't know. Hey. Go! Leave! My best friend is here. Go! Leave! Why are you late? Sorry, Madam. I only commuted. It's a hassle being single, isn't it? Nobody is going to fetch you. Why don't you hire a driver? You know how crazy Mom is. Maids and outsiders are not allowed at home. You're already old. You should learn how to drive. I'm terrified of driving. What if I pass out while driving? I might die. I don't get you. Let's just drink tequila! We're gonna get wasted tonight. Give me that! You're so gross! Gross? But admit it, you're going to miss me. Please, don't leave me! I don't want to waste the opportunity. Don't tell me you're just going to cry all night? No way! We're going to get wasted and celebrate tonight! Hey you! What's your problem? Are you taking photos of us? Stacey, calm down. Give me your phone. Stacey, relax. It's embarassing. Why are you taking photos of her? Are you stalking my friend? Stalking? No. No. It's not what you think. I'm the official photographer for tonight. The management is aware of this. I saw your friend. A good subject. She's pretty, so... I'm Lawrence. Albina. - Hi Albina. - This is Stacey. Sorry. It's her send-off party that's why she's emotional. Let me make it up to you. How about I'll buy you a drink? The both of you. Fine, Albina. Do you want to do it at my place? I'm not into first-date sex. Only makeouts? Just kiss? Like that? Well… You're playing hard to get, I see. Come on. Quick. Are you okay? You drank too much. I'm fine. I'm fine. Stacey. Do you want me to drive her home? She's so wasted. No. It's fine. I already booked a ride. I'm fine, I promise. - Are you sure? - Yeah! Please, take care of my friend. She's still reeling from a break-up. Just spend the night with him so you won't feel lonely. I will miss you so much. I will miss you so much. I will miss you. - Let me drop you home. - It's okay. I can manage. I can manage. Let's go. Come in. Don't worry about your shoes. Feel at home. So... How long have you been friends with Stacey? Since high school. Oh, since high school. I think, she's my only friend. She is my protector and now I am all alone. Don't be sad. Fine. I'm just going to shut up. I'm kidding. Don't be too serious. Since Stacey’s gone, I can be your new protector. I don't even know you. Oh, you don't? I'm Lawrence. I mean, I don't even know a thing about you. Like what I do? I'm into photography. This is my studio. That's the projector. Laptop. That's all my stuff. I know that it's a bit of a mess but... that's just me. Chill guy. What kind of answer is that? The truth. What kind of answer do you want? Here. This is my room. It's small but comfortable. Come on. Don't be shy. Are you sure you don't wanna try? No. It's against my rules. I'm not into first-date sex. Okay. I respect that. Second meeting? Did we sleep together last night? Law. Don't go deeper. It hurts. Don’t you remember? I can't remember anything. That's what you said. You told me you wanted to see my room and my... Are you serious? Maybe I was just high. I don't know. Wanna have breakfast? Hello? Hello, good morning. My apologies for the late response. Thank you so much for considering me. You're welcome. Mr. Manos liked your set card. I will text you the date and time when you should drop by our office, okay? Okay. Again, thank you so much. I got accepted in the project! Congrats! Thank you. It's my first time to be accepted in a fashion house. Congrats! Let's celebrate. Where do you want to go? I'll treat you. Okay, but not today. I gotta go. If not today, then, when? Next time. Next time? Wait… Next time? So there's still a next time? Yes. Hello? Hi. It's me, Lawrence. Just making sure it's not a fake phone number. Fuck you. Good morning. Thank you for accepting our invite and we are really happy to see all of you. Today, our owner and creative director, Greg Manos, wants to see you up close. Albina, right? Have your measurements taken in the next room. Yes! First fashion modeling gig. Congrats, babe! Babe your face! The fuck? Yes, babe? Leave me alone or I will block you, Wendell. You're so rude. I'm just proud that you have achieved your dream. Do you know why I haven't blocked you yet? Because of what we had. But I will block you I if have to. I'm sorry. I love you! Fuck you! Will you please leave me alone?! Wow. Why so intense? It's been so long since we last talked. Sorry. I thought you were someone else. What's up? Are you okay? Nothing. I just miss you. Why so clingy? Clingy? Not really. I just stumbled upon your post. Of course, I want to celebrate with you. Just make sure your boyfriend won't get mad. Enough with your old tricks. Let's go out tonight! I'll pick you up and then let's play it by ear. Game? See you. Do I have something on my face? Nothing. Then why are you staring at me? Will you be my girlfriend? Why not? Seriously? Yes. Albina. Switch places with Mika, I want you front and center. Greg! Greg! - Ma'am, you're not allowed inside. - Let me go! Why are you not answering my calls? You don't even bother calling me back! Have you forgotten? I should have been in this campaign! Have you looked at yourself in the mirror? We don't entertain sellouts. Fuck you! You need to get out, Ma'am. You fucking used me! Remember this, I will get back at you, you son of a bitch! Hi. Such a weird day, isn't it? You have nice shoes. Thank you. You look pretty. Isn't she pretty? - Yeah. So pretty. - Gorgeous. Do you have a problem with me? We just noticed that you're Greg's new favorite. Just be careful. That madwoman earlier? She's a former model here. She was Greg's favorite. Now, she's just a piece of trash. Rumor has it that Greg got her pregnant. He didn't want the baby. So she had an abortion? Yes, and she thought she can still be a model after. Just a piece of advice, don't be an ass-kisser, or else, you'll end up like her. Understood? Say it with me. I don't want to be a piece of trash. I don't want to be a piece of trash. Such a gullible woman. Mom, you scared me. The door was open. I thought there was an intruder. What are you doing here? What are you looking for? I'm looking for my baby pictures that I can use. Check it inside the box in your room. Okay. Don't you miss this? Can he make you moan like I can? You son of a bitch! Okay, girls. Let's have a 15-minute break. When you come back, make sure you're wearing the next set of collection. Okay? Okay. Go. Tuesday. Come forward please. Yes, Sir? Drop the sir. You're too formal. Okay, sir. I mean, okay. I saw your file. Your birthday's coming up. Tuesday. Happy birthday. I don't accept gifts from my boss. No, take it. I bought it for you. You're the only person I know who declines gifts. Don't you know that declining a gift brings bad luck? Sir, instead of giving me a gift, just attend my dinner party. I'll consider your presence as a gift. You know, you're... Very interesting. I'll check my schedule. Careful. Happy birthday, Albina! Good evening. Mom, Dad. This is Lawrence, my boyfriend. Lawrence. Nice to meet you. He was the one who took all my photos. You have good taste... Lawrence, right? What are you doing here? - Albina, he's our visitor. We invited him. - Sorry. Sorry. Please, bear with our daughter. - It's okay. She is such a sweet lady. - What do you do for a living, Lawrence? He's a photographer, Mom. A professional photographer. Oh, I thought he's just a hobbyist. I thought so too. We'll go ahead, Mom. I'm gonna entertain my other guests. Sure. - Nice meeting you, Uncle. - Enjoy. Drinks later, okay? - Sure, Uncle. - Alright. I'm up for it. Your ex is such a show-off. Let him be. Besides, I didn't know he was invited. It's alright. At least we're happy. Happy birthday. You need to entertain your other guests. Yes, okay. Go ahead. Hey! Happy birthday. Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad you're here. Of course. You're so beautiful. - Mom! - Yes? This is Greg Manos. Sir. Ma'am. You'll get used to Albina. She's like that. One day, she is addicted to you. The next day, she wants someone else. Why do you think we broke up? It's because you're an asshole, obviously. Chill, daddy, chill. Don’t call me daddy, I'm not your daddy. Okay. Okay. You are so lucky to have Babe. Don't call her babe. You've broken up, right? I remember how her boobs perfectly fit my hands. I miss them so much. Asshole. I miss them. Really? You miss it? Asshole! You like it? You fucker! You want this? You animal! Asshole! Baby! Baby! Albina! Albina! Albina! What are you doing here? Relax. Your parents told me to look after you. They're just downstairs. How are you feeling? Get away from me! Get out of my room! Get out! Leave! Are you fighting again? I'm sorry. I told you that I don't wanna see that guy again, and then you just let him in here while I'm unconscious? Dear, Wendell's a good guy. We trust him. Get out of my room. Hold on. I've noticed this for a while now. Where did you get this? Get out of my room! Thank you for a memorable birthday party! What do you want? Wait Albina, can we talk? Not now, Lawrence. I have no face to show my boss because of what you did at the party. Sir, I apologize for what happened at the party. Let me make one thing clear. I like you, but I'm not expecting anything in return. I just wanna see you. I just want you here. Didn't you hire me for my modeling skills? That's also a part of it. My god, that is cheap. Oh my gosh girl stop that, what is wrong with you? My goodness, I hate her so much. You fuckers! Are you talking about me?! Albina. Albina. Sir, I'm really sorry. I'm not feeling well. Albina, what's going on? Sir, is it alright if I call it a day? Sure. Thank you and I'm sorry. Albina, your body is mine and mine alone. I almost have it. They can't hurt you anymore, Albina. I'm here now. I'll come and get you. Soon. Hey! Are you alright? I've been following you. I wanted to get your attention but you seemed so out of it. Are you alright? There's something wrong with me, Lawrence. I'm hearing voices. I can hear their whispers. I don't know. They want my body. Okay. Maybe you are just tired. Maybe you are stressed at work or you are overthinking. You need to relax. Do you want to rest at my place? We were doing a photoshoot earlier, when suddenly, I felt like my co-models were talking about me. So I screamed and cursed at them. Then when I stopped, I realized that no one was actually talking. Maybe you're just pressured. You feel pressured because you want to be good at what you do. Don't worry. This will calm your nerves. Just one puff. No. No, thanks. Okay. It's alright. I have a better idea. Wait a minute. Okay. This is acid. If you take this, you'll remember all your traumas. But don't worry, you'll feel much better after. I promise. Have you tried this? When I tried it the first time, it seemed like I had a heart-to-heart talk with God. He forgave all my sins. It was crazy. So... But I am not forcing you, okay? Game? Game. Look up. Just one drop. Close your eyes. Hold it. Okay. Then, When you are ready, open your eyes. Hi, Mom! Where have you been all night? Good thing you are here. You have a delivery. Who are these packages for? They're yours. Everything is under your name, addressed here. But I already paid for everything. I did not order anything. What's inside? What is this? I did not order anything, Mom. Someone's messing with me. I think I know who did this. Get ready, bitch. Girls, next layout. Okay. Does it hurt? Do you also want me to hit you with the dildo you sent me? What the fuck?! What are you talking about?! Shit! There's a lot of blood! Please, take me to the hospital! Take me away from that crazy woman! Go home! I'll take care of it. I don't want any trouble. One screwdriver. I can bring you some place good. Charge it on me. I'm Sahil. Liv. Your husband is cheating on you. A man is alleged to have jumped to his death from the rooftop of a building in Ortigas. The police are investigating if there is foul play in the incident. Dad, have you seen Albina? I haven't seen her. Based on the CCTV footage, a woman wearing a black dress allegedly shoved the man to death. Authorities are searching for the woman's identity. Dear? Albina? Dear, is this yours? It was also delivered last week. I already threw that away. Why was it in the garden? I don't know. Just throw it away, Mom. Is this your boyfriend? Hello. You called. Hello? Do you still love me? Of course. Babe, I'm kinda busy... preparing for a shoot. Do you want to have dinner tomorrow night instead? Sure. Bye. Who fucked you? Did it feel good? You want? Fuck! It's so good! Dad! Dad! Dad, what happened to you? Dad? Dad... Baby, Sorry... I was late. Traffic was heavy. How are you? You've already ordered. Sorry. Yeah. I've ordered for you. I'm kinda full. I already ate at work. Then why did you invite me for dinner? Because I want to see you, baby. And... you want to tell me something, right? I think you're the one who needs to explain. What do you mean? Are you seeing another woman? What? Baby, no! Where did you get that? Just be honest. So that I won't look like a fool. Albina, I'm not seeing someone else. What are you talking about? Are you sure? Sure? Sure of what? That I'm not cheating on you? I am sure that I am not cheating. What the fuck, Albina? Where is this coming from? Where did you get this video? Don’t you miss this? Can he make you moan like I can? What do you want from me, Wendell? Where did you get the video? What video? This. Is that your boyfriend? Such a performer. It's not funny. Don't play games with me! Where did you get the video? Who's that girl? I have no idea. It's my first time seeing that video. You set him up. You framed him up with the girl, she seduced him. I have nothing to do with it. You left me... because I cheated on you. Yes. I admit. But to replace me with another cheater? What do you want from me? You keep on destroying me. I'm tired. - I'm just so tired. - Shhh... I knew you'll come back to me. Are you there yet? Why? Are you in a hurry? Yes. A beggar was found dead on the sidewalk in Makati last night. According to the witness, he was with a woman wearing a black dress. The suspect was allegedly under the influence of drugs. The police are conducting an on-going investigation. Love, isn't this Albina's? Where did you get that? Look, there's blood. See? Albina! Albina! Are you messing with me? I gave you the chance to tell the truth! But you still lied to me! What are you even talking about? - What are you saying? - Look! Watch this! Okay. What will I explain? Who's the girl in that video? Okay. Don't you remember this? - Lawrence, I don't understand! - Neither do I! I don't get you! I don't get why you're mad. I don't understand it! This is my baby picture... Sir, please. Stop it! Sir, stop it! All men are the same, Albina. They just want you for your body. They'll use you until they get sick of you. They're pests! They don't deserve to live! They need to be stopped. Pests! They all need to die! We'll kill them all. All men are the same, Albina. They just want you for your body. They'll use you until they get sick of you. They're pests! They're pests! They don't deserve to live! They need to be stopped. Pests! They all need to die! We'll kill them all. All men are the same, Albina. They just want you for your body. They'll use you until they get sick of you. They're pests! They don't deserve to live! They need to be stopped. Pests! They all need to die! We'll kill them all. All men are the same, Albina. They just want you for your body. They'll use you until they get sick of you. They're pests! Albina? Fidel, come with me. There's something wrong. Albina? Albina? Albina, open the door! Open the door, Fidel. Albina! Albina? What's going on, Albina? There's a woman who wants to possess me! She's been in my nightmares every night. What are you saying? She wants to possess my body! Where is it? It was just here! What are you doing here, Albina? There was a woman here! What are you saying? There was a picture of a woman! She was carrying me when I was little! But her face is gone! It was scratched out! Why won't you believe me? It's Olivia. Fidel, that's impossible! Who's Olivia? She was your nanny before. But she's dead! Where is she? Why is she haunting me? Albina, have you tried praying? You raped her! Olivia and I had an affair. You were still small. I shower her with gifts. In exchange for that... She'd willingly give herself to me. We do it when your mom is gone, or when she's asleep. One night, I felt horny. And I wanted her body. She was the one I wanted. But she wasn't feeling well. She couldn't do it with me. So, I forced her to do it with me. She told me the truth. But I didn't listen to her. Olivia, you whore! You're shameless! How could you do this to me? I gave you a job, but what did you do? Nothing would happen if I argued with your dad. But, she got pregnant. But she didn't tell me. I only knew when... your dad told me the truth. I told her... I won't be held responsible for the child. I'm an asshole. I'm selfish! After that... She tried to get an abortion. She became insane. She wandered the streets. She thought that you were her lost child. We thought we wouldn't see you ever again. We didn't want to bring her to jail, because she was already insane. We just locked her inside her room. But we didn't know that... She had an infection. Because of her abortion. She rushed her to the hospital but it was too late. She was already dead. It was too late... You're unbelievable! How could you do that? You're both heartless! You're both heartless! We're always plagued by our guilty conscience! I've had insomnia for 20 years already! She's taking revenge! I can feel that she's almost got a grip on my soul! She's going to possess me! Call a priest! Help me! Don't worry, Olivia won't succeed! Albina! Come on, let's go! Olivia, if you can hear us. Please, I'm begging you. Spare our daughter. Stop messing with Albina! Yes, we have wronged you. But it was a long time ago. Olivia, you are no longer alive. Just let us live in peace. What do you want? I don't need you. Get off of me! I won't allow it to happen, Albina. You can't survive without me! They are going to take advantage of you, Albina. And I won't let that happen. Who is going to abuse me? All of them. Olivia, we're already old. If you want justice, come after us. Make us pay for our sins. But, please, spare our daughter. I'll take you out of here, Albina. I won't let you suffer the same fate as ours, Albina. In the name... and in the power of our Lord, Jesus Christ. I command you, leave now, you demon. Leave the body of this person. Most cunning and deceitful serpent. Begone! Reconcile with our Almighty Father. Don't be a coward! Stop hiding inside Albina's innocent body. Stop hiding inside Albina's innocent body. Get out of Albina's innocent body! Albina, fight her. Fight the demon inside you. Don't let the demon take full possession of your body. Fight her. Fight the demon, Albina! This is all on you! Stop blaming the devil for your misdeeds! You will pay for all of your sins. Father, what is happening to my daughter? Tell us, Father, is the demon gone? Let's observe her for a few days. Watch over her closely. Don't let her leave the room. When the devil comes back, contact me right away. Fidel... Fidel... Don't do this, Albina. Don't do this, Albina. Feel me, Fidel. Dear, I don't wanna do this. Did you like what you did to me? Olivia, I'm begging you. Spare my daughter's life. I'm saving her from your sins, Fidel. All lies! Fuck you, Olivia! You tolerated him. You remained silent. You chose to be blinded. You are not Olivia. You're Albina! Wait. - Albina? - Can I come in? No. What are you doing here? I just want to apologize. Can we talk? No. I'm busy. I have clients. Let me in! What do you really want? You! What do you want, Albina? Can you get it? If you're surrounded by these people. Who are they? The people who abused you. What are you talking about? I want to give what you want. This is what you want, right? Say, Amen. Amen. Amen. Hello Wendell, come and pick me up please. Why didn't you teach me how to drive? You didn't tell me you want to learn. I want to. Alright. When we get home, I'm going to teach you. Albina, what are you doing? What are you doing? We might get in an accident. In other news, the police identified the suspect... in the gruesome murder of Romeo San Jose. According to the police, the man who allegedly committed suicide... was actually killed. Authorities are now looking for the suspect, the 20 year old model, Albina Tamayo. If you know her whereabouts, please contact our radio station or report to the nearest police station. Do you believe that Olivia is possessing me? I don't know. Does it matter? You need to seek help. Hello Wendell, how’s it going? Have you already seen Albina? She is with me. We're just having breakfast in a grill house. I'll just drop her off after we eat. I don't know if me cheating on you has somehow caused this mess. But I'm sorry. I'm sorry for cheating on you. If I could travel back in time, I would do everything... not to hurt you. Maybe this wouldn’t have happened. It's not too late. Hello, Stacey. How are you? Me? I just had breakfast. Yes, I had steak. I'm with Wendell. Doc, Doc! Someone wants to get inside of me. She wants to destroy my life. Who is she? Do you know her? Who wants to get inside of your body? Doc, she's already inside of me. Doc, help me! Doc! Doc! Doc! - Doc, help me! - Take her to the recreation area. Doc! Let me go! Help me! Someone wants to get my body!
