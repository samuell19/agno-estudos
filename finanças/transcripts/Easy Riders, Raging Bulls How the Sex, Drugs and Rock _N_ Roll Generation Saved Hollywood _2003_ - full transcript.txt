1966. Hollywood, California. The once great Hollywood dream factories that were teeming cities of technicians and artists, stood empty. The audiences for the movies these studios had made had drifted away, busy building families or lured away by TV. The old studio moguls who roamed these vast empty domains were confused and uncertain and, like the movies they were producing, largely irrelevant. This is the story of the young artists and film makers who stormed the gates and briefly took control of the studios, and in the process, inadvertently created the new Hollywood. I didn't really like American films and what was being done in most American films then. The studio system essentially collapsed in the early '60s. By '63, it was over. And nobody knew what the hell to do. The Fox lot - the first Hollywood lot I ever saw - had been shut down by the disaster of Cleopatra. And so, walking on the Fox lot, it really was a ghost town. The back lot, which is now Century City, had the Western streets, the stages all set up, but it was all deserted. Television had annihilated the habit audience for movies and studios were impoverished. The big old films werenâ€™t making money, The Molly Maguires and Hello Dolly - just these huge flops. The old people are dying slowly otherwise the representatives of the puritanism and religion and other organisms which were restricting. The young people are different and demand different things. "Make it new and different", they say. It really was a strong sense of a revolution happening. If you were 18 years old, as I was, God forbid you should ally yourself with the old fogeyes. Even as American films became more meaningless, foreign films were beginning to find an emerging audience hungry for something different. There were a lot of art theatres that showed foreign films. That's where Natalie and James Dean and all of us went. And I was working in American films but I was looking at foreign films. Most of the film makers of that period were brought up on Godard and Truffaut and Fellini, and they were tremendously influenced by the Europeans. This was the period of the Nouvelle Vague in France and everybody was bowled over by what Jean-Luc had done with Breathless, and what Truffaut had done with 400 Blows. And when I was in Paris, we became... friends or conversants, anyway. In New York, two young magazine writers, Robert Benton and David Newman, who had fallen under the spell of the French New Wave, decided to try screenwriting. We knew nothing about writing movies cos there weren't any - maybe there were somewhere, but we didn't know where - screenwriting courses, there were no books by McKee, or any of those gurus, and we just wrote the movie we wanted to see. Newman and Benton used their connections at Esquire magazine, where they created the Dubious Achievement Awards, to get their Bonnie and Clyde script to Francois Truffaut. He took it and broke it down into sections, and he explained to us the difference between film time and real time. And we just filled notebooks up with notes and by the end of it, we were just... The gate had opened and we were running. As the new screenwriters had lessons from the New Wave master, Arthur Penn had returned from France, inspired and eager to make a film that could draw on this new storytelling style. It would be called Mickey One. At that point, Beatty called me up out of the blue and said, "I'm Warren Beatty." I said, "Why are you calling me?" And he said, "Well, I learned early on that the people I want to work with "are the good directors, that's it." He said, "So, I'm with you." I said, "I can't even hardly pay you, you know?" "Doesn't matter. I'm in the movie." I used to be quite a fighter. I'll never forget my first opponent. It was also my last opponent. He was a little guy - only came up to my chin. The trouble was, he came up too often. Watch it, you've heard of ground beef. I had this opponent covered with blood... - Yours? - Kid, when you're working... Do you come and monkey around with my mop? - I can see this kid believes in justice. - Getting just as drunk as he can. Waiter, let me mix his next drink. Blessed are the pure in spirits, nothing's wickeder than a mixed drink. He doesn't get drunk but last night he put pennies in a parking meter and looked at the Wrigley Building clock to see how much he weighed. What a rat! Get him up here. When I shot Mickey One, both Jean-Luc and Francois Truffaut showed up in Chicago while I was shooting. Truffaut had passed the Bonnie and Clyde script onto Jean-Luc Godard after deciding to film Fahrenheit 451. Godard flirted with the project briefly, before deciding to do Alphaville instead. Meanwhile, Arthur Peon's star, Warren Beatty, was frustrated by the limitations of being just another handsome movie star bound in by the creative restrictions of studio-produced films. Warren Beatty was in Paris, making a movie and having, I think, a romance with Leslie Caron. One night they went to dinner at somebody's apartment and he found himself sitting next to Truffaut. Truffaut said, "There's a movie you should read "because it's a great part for you. "It's written by these two guys in New York." Warren came back to New York a week later and called and said, "I've read half of it, and I want to option it as soon as it's ready. "And not only do I want to play the part, I want to produce the film." That was after I had decided not to direct it myself. Arthur was available. It afforded an opportunity to work with someone with whom I had already established a certain dialogue. Someone who was aware of my bad habits, excesses, and someone whose excesses and bad habits I was aware of. - What are your bad habits? - I won't go into it. - What are his? - I won't go into those either. Beatty worked for little money up front, to convince a reluctant Jack Warner to give the script a green light. Warren called me and said he had this script. I read it and it was very good - very well-written - but, at the end of it, they just simply got shot and that was the end of it. And I thought, "I just... I don't want to do a film about two gangsters." Then I woke up one day and saw the ending, exactly as it is in the film. Hey. Jack Warner thought it was terrible... He didn't like the picture at all. We went out to, uh... Jack's house. We were about to look at the film. He said, "if I have to go pee, you know it stinks." We weren't ten minutes into the film when he got up and peed. Came back. Another ten minutes, he got up and peed. And it went like that throughout. And then, finally, the film ended, and he said, "What the hell is this?" And it was kind of quiet in the room. And then Warren said, "Well, you know, Jack, what it is, really, is an homage "to the great gangster films of the wonderful Warner Bros era." And Jack... you know, bit that. And then he looked at Warren and said, "What the fuck's an homage?" As Beatty tried to win over the old studio mogul, there was a young mogul working outside the dying studio system, who was training young film makers in the art of the low budget B-movie. By the mid '60s, producer-director Roger Corman and American International Pictures had a thriving business of making ultra-low-budget B-movies the studio felt were beneath them. He had become so successful, he started hiring up-and-comers who couldn't get in the studios. He'd get young talent in, because they'll work for the amount of... for the salary, for no salary, practically. Which is the way it should be. You come in and do anything to do the film. He wasn't a brilliant director. But he was brilliant in recognising talent in other people. So he gave people like me, Hopper, Marty Scorsese - a whole bunch... Peter Bogdanovich was working on Wild Angels - second-unit camera. It was great. One of Roger Corman's first proteges was a grad student just out of UCLA - Francis Ford Coppola. Francis made his debut editing Russian science fiction films, then worked as an assistant director on a racing film I was doing in Europe, on the Grand Prix Formula One circuit, called The Young Racers. He went on from there to Ireland, to do Dementia 13, which was his first film as a director. Don't touch her! Corman had become a prime supplier to a newly evolving audience that the studios were ignoring. In the '60s there were about 5000 drive in theatres in the US. Everywhere, all over. You know, every town had a drive-in. The drive-in audience was a young audience, and the kids liked these action and horror films - the type of pictures the independents were making. Sometimes they liked them more than the major studio films. Corman was bright in picking his subjects. LSD becomes in the paper, he makes The Trip. Motorcycle guys get in the paper, he makes a motorcycle movie. Bingo Blanket Beach Party - whatever those movies were - they make those. So they were serving a function, fast cars, motorcycles, drugs. But the one thing great about Corman was, he wouldn't pay you, but he'd give you camera and film and let you go shoot on weekends. We shot stuff on the Strip, all the acid trips and so on. Fantasizing in the desert. I directed those things. That was the first time I'd really had a camera and been able to go out and shoot stuff. The drive-ins or the art houses is where you found young hip moviegoers in '67. That's where Warner Bros released that violent bank robber movie they didn't have much faith in. Liz Smith of Cosmopolitan calls it "possibly the best film of the year." ..New Republic, "the best film of the year." ..both agree, in The Ladies' Home Journal, that it is "possibly the best film of the year." I know a lot of my friends - liberals - thought it was... hated that picture, thought it was violent and, you know, were furious at me. Never understood why the kids would go to it four, five, six times. They just didn't understand that picture. Because it was about... Well, as Jack Warner said, "You can't tell the good guys from the bad guys." Bonnie and Clyde's anti-Establishment stance made it a huge hit, perfectly reflecting the disillusionment of that winter of '67-'68. With protests against the Vietnam War, race riots in the ghetto and anarchy in the streets, the younger generation was angry and speaking out. No one was more surprised than this disenfranchised audience that they might have an ally in Hollywood. Raised on a steady diet of old films running on television, the early '60s spawned the first generation of movie buffs that saw film as an art form that they were determined to be a part of. I used to see Peter when he was writing for Esquire, and barely keeping alive. In fact, we'd go to screenings at The Directors Guild and he was always the first person at the table to get some food. It was clearly his only meal of the day. Bogdanovich came West with new bride, Polly Platt, looking for a way to break into movies. We met Roger - we went to see Last Year at Marienbad - I'm pretty sure that was the film and he was sitting behind us. We got talking after the screening, and we went out and had a couple of drinks. I got friendly with Peter and he worked with me as a second-unit director and general production assistant on The Wild Angels. They're wild and no angels. Law-defying - getting their kicks from violence and torture. The Wild Angels, starring Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra. And I met with Roger, and he said, "We're making a movie about the Hell's Angels without making a statement." I thought, "A movie about the Hell's Angels on its own is a statement. "Let's see how he does it." Their intimacies, a rape of decency. Their every enjoyment, a parody of pleasure. Roger kept missing shots - you know, he would fall behind during the day - and he'd say, "We'll shoot that in the second unit." I had never heard of that but Peter was on to it. And I did everything possible, from ordering lunch, and organizing the laundry to rewriting 80% of the script, without credit and directing three weeks of the second unit. The Wild Angels was a big hit for Corman. And, as usual, he rewarded the young Bogdanovich with a chance to direct his own picture, if he could figure out how to use an existing Corman asset. He said, "Take some footage from The Terror. "Shoot some additional footage with Boris Karloff who owes me two days." And we looked at the movie and were devastated because we could not think of anything. I kept saying to Peter, "Why are these Victorian horror films not scary?" Peter was shaving one morning and he came in and he said, "We'll use The Terror as a movie within the movie, "and Boris Karloff will play an ageing horror-movie star who speaks for us." And he's the one who says, "These movies aren't frightening any more, I'm a dinosaur." And the other plot line is this young all-American, good-looking boy, who starts buying guns. And we see him, you know, spreading all his gun, and eating a chocolate bar, very cool. And picks up his telescopic rifle and starts aiming. And it's a very frightening movie because he starts shooting. The film was so well-made, Corman sold it to Paramount Pictures. Paramount, like many of the old studios, was in serious trouble when it was acquired by Gulf and Western, a conglomerate headed by a mad Austrian. Charles Bluhdorn was his name, an Austrian-born fellow of mega-maniacal dimensions. "You think I make money on pictures? I don't! "I make money on zinc and sugar! "Not pictures, it's bullshit. "But I like it sometimes. But zinc, yes!" There was no logical business reason. Let's put it this way. Bluhdorn did not have a business plan as to what to do with Paramount, there was no grand design. He loved Hollywood, liked pretty women, and thought that here was a business in chaos, maybe there was an opportunity here. One of Bluhdorn's first decisions was to hire failed actor turned producer Bob Evans to run the West Coast operations. Hollywood wags assumed Evans was an attractive pimp for Bluhdorn. After all, who but a pimp would want to take over the moribund Paramount? We were suffering with an inventory of films that had already been started. You had to get through first that dreadful period where we made Bluhdorn's dreams, you know, musicals like Paint Your Wagon. When I had to sit in the screening room and listen to Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood sing, as dailies, I thought, "Why did I leave The New York Times to listen to Lee Marvin singing?" Evans and Bart signaled Paramount's new direction by signing the director of the European horror film Repulsion, Roman Polanski, to his first real studio deal for Rosemary's Baby. The picture was a big hit for Paramount, and the elfin, fun-loving Polish Polanski quickly became a part of Bob Evans' social scene. Evans would introduce Polanski to other young power players in the New Hollywood, including Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson. Women, wine, parties and good blow were some of the rewards of success in Hollywood and Polanski, Nicholson and Evans shared their drugs and their women. But what none of them could know was how often violence would crash their parties and change their lives, starting with Paramount's scheduled release of Targets in the summer of '68. So, uh... my thanks to all of you. And now it's on to Chicago, and let's win there. Thank you. I had my baby daughter on my hip and had gone to vote for him. And... and that night, I remember, when he was assassinated, after the initial shock and horror, I realized it was the end of Targets. I knew that no one would want to go see that movie. After Kennedy's assassination, the studio yanked Targets from theatres. But for Corman and those involved in making the youth-oriented B-movies so successful at the drive-ins, it was a boom time, with one hit after another. The old studio bosses, however, continued hiding behind their high walls with their heads in the sand. But one studio head, Stanley Schneider at Columbia Pictures, had a son young and hip enough to hear the rumble coming down the road. Bert is the single most significant person in post-1950s... I mean, he is the equivalent, in terms of producers, of what Selznick had been before. He revolutionized film making from the producer's side. And mainly, he trusted film makers and gave them complete creative freedom. Bert Schneider was the epitome of a certain kind of time-and-place producer. Everyone wanted to be Bert Schneider and then nobody wanted to be Bert Schneider. Well, he was cool. He was so cool it was like frightening. He provided the drugs, he provided the sauna, he provided the pool he provided the good vibes, he provided the notion that nobody should ever feel shitty. I always thought Bert was kinda mean. He kinda scared me. You know, of course, I met Bob later, and he's... he's like a beautiful rebel kinda guy, Bob. Bob Rafelson, a hip young writer-producer and Bert Schneider, an exec at Columbia Pictures, had hooked up as friends in New York, and came west with an attitude. They created Raybert Productions, a TV and movie production company. He was the center of an extraordinary little... community. - How do you feel now? - Oh, comme Ci, comme ca. That's enough. Cut it. Print it. Good hit. That should be it. OK, I think we're on another set. Hey, Bob, that's not right, man. You know, hitting a girl. - Hey, did that look good? - I thought it looked great. But about hitting a woman, man, it's about the image and it's not right. - I hate to interrupt. - I know, it's for your niece. Her name? - Mary. - Fellas, let's move to the right. - John, was that right, man? - Yeah. - John, that's not right. - Can you move over? Damn it. Bob, it's a movie for kids. They're not gonna dig it, man. The Beatles were very popular then, and Bob got the idea of doing a television show based on a rock group. And so he created The Monkees. It was an extremely successful show. Raybert was just these couple of guys. Very young for people in the industry then. Every other audition had been some fat guy in a suit going, "All right, want to read a few lines?" Bert Schneider's father ran Columbia Pictures. There Bert and Bob pitched their idea for an American Beatles. The Monkees, in some way, were simply a cynical decision to rip off the Beatles, and be successful in the most traditional terms on television. We were never allowed, on the TV show, to reference the war ever, to reference society, anything anti-American, anything controversial. Certainly, no references to even getting stoned. You know, it was all really sickly sweet- you know, white bread. The economic success of that put Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson into the catbird seat, and what they chose to do with that is what's interesting. As TV embraced youth programming, the studios still didn't get it - but Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson sure did. Flush with money from The Monkees, they knew there was an audience for something different. Peter talked about what was then called The Loners - Easy Rider. Jack Nicholson had talked Bert into this, I believe, by saying, "Bike movies make money. You're not gonna lose any money." So Schneider said, "I'm gonna give you the money to go and shoot this, "shoot it in 16mm and if I like what I see "then I'll give you the rest of the money to make the feature movie." So I got five friends of mine, that had 16mm cameras, all of 'em who wanted to be directors - in the middle of Mardi Gras... And I was crazy. There's no question about it. Get into the Winnie, in search of the Mardi Gras parade - which, if you've seen the movie more than once, you'll notice we were never in. The Winnebago never found the Mardi Gras. And there are reasons for that. Everyone was stoned out of their minds. Every person... everyone was stoned out of his mind. That's correct, isn't it? Dennis was just shooting. Getting... He was gonna "get" New Orleans, man. Which he did. We shot for four days, and I literally walked people through the streets, it was like the Bataan march. Finally, Barry Feinstein said, "I can't take any more," and started throwing the cans of films at me and said, "That's it, you know." I said, "if you can't take any more, give me the film!" He said, "You want the film?" He starts throwing. We get into a fist fight. He pushes me into a room. Peter's in bed with Karen and Toni Basil, and a fight proceeds. Whereupon... it ends, and... everybody leaves. After the acid-trip scene at the cemetery, Hopper and Fonda returned to Los Angeles. I get back and unbeknownst to me, Peter and Bill Hayward, my brother-in-law, came back from New Orleans and offered to give back the $20,000 that... Obviously, that I was a crazy person. And what they had done was, they started taping me - my screaming, and my raving and ranting and they played this for Bert Schneider and Jack Nicholson. And Bert said, "Well... he sounds excited. "But I hired this man to direct this movie and he's gonna direct this movie." Oh, they're not scared of you - they're scared of what you represent to 'em. Hey, man. All we represent to them, man, is somebody who needs a haircut. Oh, no. What you represent to them is freedom. What's wrong with freedom? That's what it's all about. That's right - that's what it's all about. But talking about it and being it, that's two different things. It's real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. Don't ever tell anybody that they're not free, cos they'll get busy killin' and maimin' to prove that they are. On the main poster for Easy Rider there wasn't a motorcycle on it. The phrase on the top said... "A man went looking for America and couldn't find it anywhere.â€œ When we all, the hippies - when we arrived at the sales office at Columbia, we thought, "What are these guys gonna know?" We walked in and saw that, "That's gotta be it. It's amazing. "That came out of...? Far out - put it in. It's great." As Columbia prepared Easy Rider for release, United Artists was starting the most controversial studio picture to date. There was at UA at that time this extraordinary group of people, who had an extraordinary concept about how to finance and distribute films. UA had created a world that the majors were not aware of - studios didn't understand the concept of giving creative control to a film maker. We did it with every film maker. One that UA wanted to work with was John Schlesinger, who had recently scored with Darling, which won its star, Julie Christie, an Academy Award. I told John Schlesinger, "We want to make a movie with you. "What do you want to do?" He said, "There's a book, you'll never do it." It was Midnight Cowboy. It never would have been made under the studio system. John was at a real turning point at the Cowboy time. He was in the closet, close friends knew that he was gay but he was desperate to break out. He wanted to... He's a gay man and he wanted to have a gay partner, and live a gay life. And he had all these archaic ideas that if the crew knew that he was gay, that he'd ask them to do something, and they'd say, "Fuck you, faggot! You faggot - get outta here!" I mean, these childhood dreams that... must have tormented him and all that. So I just said, "John, it's our movie. "If we don't like someone, we'll throw him out." He got it through his head that maybe it would be all right, although he was very frightened, and then he fell in love with a man who he's still with now, 39 years later. And John was like any one of us if you're in love. I mean, you're totally on fire with ideas. And he was inspired - there's no question about it. - When did you last go to confession? - That's between me and my confessor. And another thing, you're beginning to smell. - For a stud that's a handicap. - Don't talk to me about clean. I ain't never seen you change your underwear once. - That's pretty peculiar. - I don't do that in public. - I got no need to expose myself. - I bet. I bet you ain't never been laid! And you're gonna tell me what appeals to women? I know that that big dumb cowboy crap of yours don't appeal to nobody, except every Jackie on 42nd Street. That's faggot stuff. You want to call it by its name, that's strictly for fags. J-John Wayne - are you gonna tell me he's a fag? The film would be nominated for seven Oscars, win three - including Best Picture - and be the first studio film with an X rating. 1969 continued to rock the movie business. Woody Allen and Paul Mazursky directed their first features, Haskell Wexler did Medium Cool, and Robert Altman's antisocial MASH But the biggest shake-up came as the quintessential American drive-in movie premiered at Cannes. This is the spring of '69 and there's an anti-festival at the same time, and we win the anti-festival. The film blew everybody away so badly, they actually created a category for it, so it could be given a prize at Cannes. It was tremendous. People did not know how to take us at all. They just... you know, we were all bearded, or long-haired and, you know, it was very far-out. Nobody thought Easy Rider would become a seminal film. It was just another bike movie. There was a lot of dialogue, a lot of problems, these hippies had gone out, and they were stoned and they made this movie, and it was never gonna go together, and they'd spent 700,000, whatever it was. And that was kinda the rap on the movie, that, at least, we heard. And then it went out, and it was boffo. I mean, there was genuine shock. ~ Get your motor runnin' ~ ~ Head out on the highway ~ ~ Lookin' for adventure ~ ~ In whatever comes our way ~ ~ Yeah, I gotta go make it... ~ Hollywood couldn't figure out why anybody was going to see that movie. And that was just - it seems to me that that was just as the change was happening. I mean, it was Vietnam, it was... Long hair was becoming more popular. They had lost their audience. They had not addressed their audience, or what their audience were into. We'd gone through the '60s, and nobody'd ever seen drugs smoked without going out and committing some kind of murder, or atrocity of some kind. When you went to see Easy Rider and when you saw these guys really smoking grass by the fire and, really, the camaraderie was warm and real and rare, you went, "What the hell am I looking at? This has value! "This has a completely different kind of value than Pillow Talk. "This is something extraordinary! I want more of that!" But then I kept seeing movies where people vomited. I want you to meet my fiancÃ©e. Another new talent brought a new level of violent realism to the screen. His name was Sam Peckinpah. He liked drinking, women and brawling with studio executives. His violent lyricism changed movies forever. The first time I worked for Sam, he wrote The Rifleman. He hadn't directed yet, but he came on set and would whisper, "Why don't you do this?" So I was the guest star in The Rifleman, which he always got an income from. So that was when I first knew him. And he was one of the few guys that I knew in the inside that smoked grass. So he and I used to smoke in his office. I knew Sam at the time of Wild Bunch, hanging around him, and, erm, wrote a long article about him. And I just thought he was brilliant - brilliant. And I saw the three hours and 45 minutes version of The Wild Bunch, which was the most brilliant thing I'd ever fucking seen. The Wild Bunch was, in part, an allegory for America's increasingly violent involvement in Vietnam. Fortunately the violence of the new cinema had been limited to the screen. For most of those at the top of the new Hollywood, life was a nonstop party with an endless flow of beautiful women and men, eager to explore the new sexual freedom, enhanced and encouraged with the best drugs money could buy. Everybody knew everybody else, and it seemed like the high would last forever. Then, on the morning of August 9th, 1969... Charlie Manson's followers broke into Roman Polanski's house and butchered his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, and four others, while the director was away in Europe. Rumors flew of orgies and drug abuse. There was a lot of talk about drugs. Sharon not only didn't use drugs, she didn't touch alcohol, she didn't smoke cigarettes. The last film she made was not a very happy experience for her but her greatest picture she was doing was her pregnancy. I never seen a woman more preoccupied with it. The house is open now, the police has released it, and you can go and see the orgy place. You will see a lot of blood all over the place, cradles, baby clothes - and that's all. We all knew Sharon, and we knew, you know, Jay Sebring, and we knew these people that were part of our everyday life out here. And suddenly they were all chopped up and messed around. A lot of rage in there, huh? Well, there was a lot of rage in the hippie communities, and on the street in the hippie sides because the voice was not being heard, the war was going on, it was still whacked out... because we were blowing it. The trick and the secret is of creating a film by literally saying you're doing it. I mean, it's not a matter of asking someone to let you make a movie. Francis was the smartest of all the film makers, in terms of trying to bring film makers together, and do interesting things, and move into technology and move the rest of the world into technology. The idea is, you gotta really... really want to do something and then nothing can stop you. I thought that he was just another, you know, mistake in the security of Hollywood, you know. I looked at it as sort of a walled city, and there were breaches in the defences. Occasionally you could get in through them and see what was on the other side of the wall. That didn't mean that the police wouldn't find you. The Rain People - Warner Bros didn't want to make it. They couldn't care less about this movie. I went in one day and said, "We're flying to New York "to shoot some film for my new movie." They said, "We gotta approve it." I said, "Well, I'll pay for it myself." When I made Easy Rider, he was coming across the top. I was crossing the south of the country and he was crossing the north. He was doing The Rain People. Francis Ford Coppola is on the crest of the new wave of American film makers. Already he has been named best director, and awarded the grand prize at the San Sebastian Festival in Spain. He'd gotten on the wall somehow, and he'd gotten, you know, the local authorities convinced that he should be there. And, of course, he brought in the Trojan horse. Would you tell us about your assistant, George Lucas? He's not my assistant... Your... Associate. George won an award to come and observe a film being made, and he came when we were making Finian's Rainbow. And I kept seeing this skinny kid and he's always looking. I said, "Who's that?" He said, "He's observing you." I think the student films are the only real hope. They're slowly realizing that students know what theyâ€™re doing. Time magazine had pictures of all of us in, and we'd just won The National Student Film Festival. I won it for Marcello, I'm bored, George won it for THX, Marty Scorsese won for one of his films. His, probably, was a real film. Mike Medavoy was a young talent agent when he went looking for the next big thing. I called my secretary and said, "Find these guys. Let's call them." So I went up and I called John Milius. I went out and signed him, signed Spielberg - signed a few others. He was a very, very good agent but a terrible deal-maker. He... You know, he'd... get you anything. You know, if the guy said, "Well, I really can't... I want to hire the guy but I've only got $35," Medavoy'd take the $35. What was good about that was it kept you working. As the oldest of the film school grads, Francis Coppola set up Zoetrope as a production banner for emerging talent. Two of the new film men, Francis Coppola and George Lucas, are discussing director Lucas' new movie, THX 1138. George, where did the very first idea of THX come to you? It came from reading comic books when I was ten years old. Well, Zoetrope was the first attempt by a kind of outsider... film maker, who was gonna bring together and form a commune of film makers. And it's to Francis's credit that he tried to put it together. Everybody had a six-picture deal with Francis. So it was six other film makers, my husband among them, whose projects were supposed to go to Warner. The deal was we were driving to Warner Bros, Francis would show themTHX, Zoetrope's flagship first production, and then present them with these silver boxes with our scripts. They saw THX, everyone's project was canceled. Lucas was angry and humiliated by the reaction to the film and the cancellation of other Zoetrope projects. A crushed Coppola withdrew to San Francisco, taking a high-paying script job on the film Patton. This whole thing was that Francis was kind of regarded as this guy who'd sold them out. Francis was the Establishment now. While Coppola explained to Lucas and the others why he couldn't save their projects, Peter Bogdanovich was trying to get his next directing job. Bert Schneider was looking for new films to do, after Easy Rider's success. He let me direct my first movie, A Safe Place, which Jack Nicholson agreed to be in. And Nicholson was given permission to direct his first film, Drive, He Said. And along the way I thought of Peter. They said, "if you ever have a picture you want to make, we'd be interested." So not too long after that I called and said, "There's a book I'd like to do, called The Last Picture Show. "You can get it in paperback. Larry McMurtry wrote it." Bert said, "Well, send it on over." I said, "Why don't you buy it?" Arrogant. Thinking, "if he can't even buy the book "he won't be interested in making it." A week later, he called me. "It took a while to find the book "but we got it and we'd like to make it." So we made the movie. It was filled with lots of drama. The Last Picture Show was a frank exploration of sexuality in a classic American film making style. It was also an emotionally painful experience for its makers, the husband and wife team of Peter Bogdanovich and Polly Platt, We were in preproduction in LA, and we were already looking at actors and actresses to play these parts. And I saw a magazine cover at this checkstand of Ralph's Market. And there was this girl with what I thought looked like a sexual chip on her shoulder. Corkscrew curls, you know, blonde hair, blue eyes. Just arrogant little thing, you know. Although she turns out to be a tall, tall girl. And I said to Peter, "Doesn't that look just the way Jacy should look?" And Peter said, "Yes." And, you know, he set about finding her. I knew you couldn't do it. Now I'll never get to not be a virgin. What'll we tell everybody? I just want to cry. My mother was dead right about you! I don't know what happened. Don't go out there! We haven't had time to do it! I don't want one soul to know. You better not tell... Just pretend it was wonderful. I don't know what happened. Oh! If you say that one more time, I'll bite you! Oh, gee, tell us, Jacy. What was it like? I just can't describe it. I just can't describe it in words. I had a brief affair with Jeff Bridges. Then he went on National Guard duty, reserve, and that was when Peter made that fateful comment to me. We were shooting the scene in the theatre - my first scene in the movie. And he was sitting in the row behind me. He leaned forward and said, "I donâ€™t know who I want more, you or Jacy." And I was so... so struck by that. Then they said, "We're ready, Cybill." And I had to make that entrance and say, "What y'all doing back here in the dark?" And, I mean, it lit that moment. It lit that moment. it was real. Peter meant it but it was also... it was... You couldn't have told well, me, certainly, at that time, anything else that would have... I was lit up. Her boyfriend, back in New York, didn't want her to show her breasts or do any of the nude scenes in the movie. So there were all these tears and drama and I remember, you know, I saw my husband falling in love with her or falling in, you know, developing this crush on her and I remember being grateful that she even had a boyfriend. Peter asked me, it was interesting, "Do you think I should fire her because she won't do these nude scenes?" And I said no. I don't think anything could have stopped it. I feel very badly, in many ways, now that I'm a little wiser. For Polly, I know that must have been hell for her. I even, in a certain way, I understood, I felt it was an occupational hazard of the job. I just thought it might be a temporary thing. I've learned since, over many years, that was far more like Jacy than I ever imagined. In real life. If I had it to do all over again, I would do the same. While Bogdanovich's marriage was coming apart, Warren Beatty was winning a reputation as Hollywood's premier bachelor. However, his follow-up to Bonnie And Clyde, The Only Game In Town, wasn't scoring nearly as well. Beatty needed a hit and he believed strongly in directors. ..John McCabe, he came with poetry on his lips. If a frog had wings, he wouldn't bump his ass so much. A deck in his pocket. What do you say we make this a nickel game, huh? A man who knew where he was going. - Where are you going? - Nowhere, uh... I was just wondering where you was gonna go. Well, I was gonna go over there by that fence. Oh. The problem was, the director of his next film, Robert Altman, believed the only star in an Altman film was Robert Altman. And Beatty, after successfully producing Bonnie And Clyde, was not prepared to play a supporting role, even to his director. Warren kept worrying about coverage. Because he had produced Bonnie And Clyde, and by that time he had a sense of what you needed to cut away to and Bob doesn't direct that way. So, the times when things got testy, it was really a matter of style. Warren is very precise and you have to honor that but he's not the director or making the film at that moment in time. There was a scene actually going on about eight minutes. It's a wonderful scene we shot with two cameras. So two cameras, eight minutes long and we did about 40 times. Imagine just how many rolls of film that was. Was that 80 rolls of film? Because we had to use 80 rolls of film. That's 80,000 feet of film. So we went, probably, about, I don't know, 27 or 28, when Robert said, "You know, it's not getting better. "I told you that take eight was perfect for me." "You kept going," and all that. "I was happy with take eight." And Warren says, "I want to do one more." And then Robert says, "OK, Warren, I tell you what, "I'm tired, I'm going to go home. "You do as many takes as you want. These boys are going to take it. "Finish it when you want." And then he went home. Neither Beatty or Altman were happy and McCabe would mark the last time a star would destabilize one of Altman's productions. As Beatty struggles with Altman, Dennis Hopper planned his next film. Well, I'm gonna now make the movie that I wanted to make as my first movie, which is called The Last Movie. It starts with the last scene of a movie being shot and the company leaves. The people are left with their streets where one man becomes the director. He makes the people build a stick camera and act out the violence that the movie company acted out. After being turned down by his former partners at BBS, Dennis Hopper took his new project to Universal Pictures, which set up a low-budget division, headed by Ned Tannen, to try to cash in on the youth market. A friend of mine was flying with Dennis Hopper on an airplane and he said, "Dennis loves Me And Bobby McGee "and he wants to hear more of your songs "cos he's making a movie and he wants to see if you can do the music for it." And so my publisher flew me out to LA, out here, and Dennis took my songs and showed them to Phil Spector and at the end of it, he said, "Will you go down to Peru with me? I'm making this movie," which was The Last Movie. And he took me down there to do the music for it. I was just remembering the plane trip down to Peru was one of the scariest things I've been in. Here was a plane full of strange people, including myself, but they were all so loaded and walking up and down the aisles and singing and dancing and the plane was rocking, it was some Peruvian airline. It was, it was really a ship of fools, you know? It's amazing that anybody got out of that alive. By the time I got down to Peru, I think he'd already antagonized the Catholic Church, the military junta, the communists, who were building a road that we had to take from Cuzco up to Chinchero, where they were filming. They cast all these friends of Dennis's, Mitchum's son and all these other guys that were huge and they rode on horses and took an enormous quantity of drugs. And being in the Andes, in the cocaine capital of the world, it was a very insane scene. But for me, it was an interesting introduction to the film... to movies. Hey! Cut, cut. What the goddamn hell's the matter with you, Tex? - Where have you been? - My name's Kansas, I'm... I don't care. Who hired him? - Hey, man, you're in shot. - OK, get out... - He's supposed to be in the shot. - I don't give a damn. Did you hire him? All right. Get your positions again and on the double. Kansas, quit spooking that goddamn horse, we're trying to get the shot, here. The movie was in Dennis's mind so nobody else seemed to know what was going on or what was happening. I was convinced that we had a good movie in the can so we all come back, Dennis goes to Taos, New Mexico, and, I think, he bought DH Lawrence estate, which is a beautiful compound, and all. And he decided he's gonna edit the film there. Of course, he invited all his buddies and everybody and it was endless 24-hour parties, and all that stuff, you know, and spending money, and all, and everybody was giving advice. You know, "You should do this, that." And basically, what happened, really, Dennis screwed it up in editing. He didn't let anybody, a professional editor, come in. And that's what he should have done. He was going his own way. I think Dennis had probably been fighting so long to do it his way that when he got a budget which seemed outlandish at the time, I think it was a million dollars, he was not going to be pushed around by anybody. I wouldn't re-edit it, which is what he wanted. - Did they re-cut it? - They couldn't re-cut cos I had final cut. But I had final cut and cut my own throat. The picture's demise was the first threat to the new power studios were giving directors. Over at Paramount, studio heads Robert Evans and Peter Bart were about to find themselves homeless. Well, what happened was that, reduced to simplest terms, the Mafia bought the lot with the Vatican bank as a front. It was arranged by a rather unsavoury character named Michele Sindona. I say to you he was a bit unsavoury, he ended up being murdered in a jail in Sicily, which I would suggest is a reasonable qualification for unsavoury. But at this moment in time, he was a banker. He bought the lot, immediately started shooting porn movies on the lot. Evans and Bart moved Paramount's offices to Beverly Hills. While this was going on, Mario Puzo approached his friend, Bob Evans, desperately in need of cash for gambling debts. Evans wrote a cheque on the spot for ten grand for an outline Puzo gave him about the Mafia. The book was published and this obscure project that I was nursing, that no one paid attention to was the number one bestseller in the world. Suddenly, everybody in the studio and in the parent company had a better idea as to who should direct and star in it. We talked to everybody. Evans and I talked to almost everybody. Nobody wanted to do it. It glorified the Mafia. It made them Robin Hoods, and all the excuses you can think of. All of a sudden, everybody got off the picture. it couldn't be put together. And suddenly it turned up on my desk again as an almost abandoned project. So... went back to plan A. I got a call from Peter asking me if I'd be interested in producing The Godfather. I couldn't catch my breath for a minute. And, of course, I said, "Beyond a shadow of a doubt." He said, "Well, the one caveat is Charlie Bluhdorn wants to meet. "He has to approve the producer and the director of the Godfather. "Can you come to New York to meet him?" And I said, "Absolutely." I was there in Stanley's office, the adjoining door flies open, it's Charlie Bluhdorn, this hyper, wacko Austrian. "Ruddy, I'm Charlie Bluhdorn." "Yeah, hello." That was the last line, doesn't ask me how was the flight? Nothing. "What you wanna do with this movie?" I looked at him, I looked at my book. If I start discussing this book, it's the end of the meeting. I said, "Charlie, "I wanna make an ice-blue, terrifying movie about people you love." "That's brilliant." He jumps... He runs out of the office and slams the door. I say, "Stanley, what the hell is that?" He says, "I'll find out." He says, "Charlie thinks you're a genius. You got the job." Hollywood was stunned when Paramount announced that their blockbuster would be directed by Francis... who? Francis had, as a director, done You're A Big Boy Now, Finian's Rainbow, The Rain People. So it's not the greatest recommendation for taking him over to direct, so, truthfully, we hired Francis as a result of his writing ability. He had already won the Academy Award, just won it, for Patton. Coppola initially turned Paramount down. He didn't wanna do a Hollywood gangster movie. The original Godfather book had a lot of sleazy aspects to it that were cut out for the movie and I didn't like it much for those reasons and I was very frightened of getting, once again, coopted into another project, low budget, it was a very inexpensive film. In those days, they wanted young directors cos they wanted it cheap. And I did turn it down, actually, once or twice. You know, the Zoetrope studio wasn't working and I admired his idealism but he did have some kids and, erm, I reminded him rather frequently that he was broke and that this would be one way of getting out of it. And, er, he kind of agreed. While The Godfather preoccupied the higher-ups at Paramount, Bart and Evans gave the go-ahead to a bizarre script helmed by a director considered extremely eccentric, even by the standards of '60s Hollywood. The prototypical early '70s meeting - Hal Ashby, who couldn't pitch anything. Long, scruffy beard, the ultimate film geek. For a guy who, when you first met him, looked like he would never be able to tie his own shoes, that you worried about if he was gonna cross the street, who would have surprised you if he'd ever learnt how to use an ATM machine. But if you looked behind that a bit, here's a man who manipulated the studios to do exactly as he wanted. He says, "I'd like to introduce you to somebody "who got a sense of this movie." Brings in Cat Stevens. Cat Stevens is not somebody you would want to be in the same room with. He looked like a homeless person. And the two of them, in their inarticulate '60s way, pitch Harold And Maude. They had a great sense of the movie. But Bob and I had spent a few months trying to persuade Hal to do it. Not till he met Cat and they came up with this idea for, like, a mini opera, did this thing make sense. We were this little unit that was out of sight, out of mind. And they'd look at dailies. And Hal had a... His philosophy was, "Here's the script. You've hired me as a director, I'm gonna cast it, "we've agreed on a budget, beat it." Midway through the cutting period, we had half the film, that he sent to Paramount and they loved 'em. They thought... They really thought... So that we had a Christmas release. - Oh, it's all right. - It's organic. The first review was Murph in Variety and it said, "Harold And Maude is as funny as a burning orphanage." And I... And that was a good one. I mean, Time said, "We're gonna do you a favour. We're not gonna review it." So. Erm, so that was the end of it. It opened and closed in a week. And it was gone. Bingo. I mean, it was so weird. And we'd spent a year on it, you know, and... nobody got it. In the weeks before Christmas, 1971, Paramount Pictures began a nationwide campaign advertising The Godfather. They were doing something no studio had ever done - opening a film everywhere at once on an unprecedented 400 screens. The picture opened to phenomenal business, grossing over $80 million in its initial run. Nothing in Hollywood history had ever made this much money this fast. They saw the amount of money that came through the door, it was suddenly Gulf... everything... News Corp... Everyone started looking at studios differently. They started looking at studios as real cash cows. The success of The Godfather confirmed Coppola as a genuine artist. He would use that power to help other directors. But first, he would bring the exiled George Lucas back to Hollywood. And, ultimately, what got Graffiti made was they said, "if Francis Coppola produces this film, we'll do it." George kept saying, "I know people will love this movie, it will be a big hit." We said, "George, if you make this movie, consider yourself very fortunate." It was just the joy of creating something. We didn't have to use stars. We didn't have to do anything according to the rules. - We're all done out here. - All done? What's he mean? Er, he means we're all done having loads of fun out here. Wonderful, have all the fun you want. This place is for fun. - Yes, it is. Thank you. - Well. - Thank you both. - Good luck, son. Wait. Before I say goodbye, I hope you'll be taking along with you a little piece of this place. - I think I have. - Good. Don't forget us. No, I won't forget you and you won't forget me. - No, kid, bye-bye. - Goodbye and good luck. - Bye. - It was nice to meet you. Right. What he said goes for me, too. You might just make it as a Pharaoh yet, boy. Everyone in that set believed and said and stated aloud that this was a classic film. That we were making a classic, a cult movie, a movie that would be important. And I said, "What are you talking about? This is just a little movie. "It's just a little thing. We're here in Modesto. We're not making history." I'll never forget the horror of the people at Universal, when they looked at this picture. "What is this? It's not even good enough to run on television. "What is this thing?" Someone said, "The kids may like it." "'The kids? But they don't go to the movies." The whole orientation was different. There was a famous incident where Francis said, "if you don't like this movie and don't want to do anything with it, I do. "I think it's great. Here's a cheque and I'll buy it." We made no offer, there were discussions and at the last moment, Universal, smartly, decided to preview it before an audience and deliberately invite some kids. And, of course, I knew the jig was up cos the kids adored this movie. Universal said, "We thought of selling this? We don't wanna sell it." But there was no understanding about the youth market. That was later. With the success of American Graffiti, the door swung open to Hollywood's next generation which was coming ashore in Malibu. And it was just one of my favourite surfing spots on the whole coast. And, all of a sudden, I find all these people I know have houses there. Donald Sutherland was an old lover of mine from Canada. He told me about this house on Nicholas Beach that was 400 bucks a month. It was a great house, right on the beach with two bedrooms upstairs and in that hideous '60s A-line split-level style with an avocado-green shag rug and it was about that deep. It was very beautiful and very free out there. The ocean was incredible. We were right on these beautiful dunes on a private road and Michael and Julia Phillips rented a house on the beach. Julia and Michael Phillips had produced a hit, The Sting, for Universal. We met as neighbours and became very good friends and became, I guess, co-conspirators in a sense, unconscious co-conspirators, in that we began to mix our friends and relationships on a social level but it became an important career thing. Jenny and I were quite arrogant about being the queen bees who decided who was in and who was out in this peculiar little rapidly-growing crowd of misfits. Jenny was friends with Brian De Palma, who I promptly got a crush on. They became an item and he brought Marty out, Marty Scorsese, who brought Harvey Keitel out. This odd friend of his, Harvey Keitel, who came with Marty, you didn't get one without the other. And then, like, Schrader was there. Marty, or Brian, had another place and Michael and Julia Phillips had one and between the three places, people would run into each other. I think Milius... Did he know Brian or...? Did he know Marty? Who first brought Bobby De Niro out? And Al Pacino? That's easy, he was going out with Jill. And Margie brought home her darling little friend Steven Spielberg. A bunch of actors, you know, lots of girls. I'm telling you, life was good. Steven certainly wasn't a ladies' man and Marty wasn't and Paul Schrader wasn't. I think these were just like... The truth is, on some level, they were nerdy guys who wanted to hang out and talk movies and make movies. There was a chemistry going on between these people having a chance to meet and talk and hang out. Well, Julia Phillips, she pulled everybody together. She wanted to exploit everybody. But she actually had a very positive effect, cos she was full of enthusiasm. "What movie do you want to do? Let's get this done." We all really rooted for each other in every way - went to each other's screenings, read each other's screenplays, offered suggestions, advised on each other's love life. It was all in the pot and up for grabs and very much a communal experience. Nicholas Beach, with its rabid film buff culture, would create both competition and inspiration. Imagine De Palma, Spielberg, Schrader, Milius, Scorsese, all arguing over movies, favourite directors and possible projects. They drove each other to think and believe they could make great films. Run, Bertha! The young Scorsese had only directed the Corman-produced Boxcar Bertha. He would prove his talent to his buddies with a film from the streets. The characters in Mean Streets are a compilation of many characters in the neighbourhood where I used to live... but he lived there all his life. Jonathan Taplin was a rock a roll refugee who decided to check out movies. I was kind of arrogant enough... I didn't know what I didn't know. So I figured if I could have produced 300 rock and roll concerts in four years why couldn't I produce a movie? Sol put some of my money in, a couple of friends' money in, we got together half a million dollars and we made Mean Streets. Nothing. I won't say nothing to Giovanni. Hey, I wanted to ask you something. I've always wondered about her - God's honest truth - what happens when she comes? - What? - What's that? What happens when she comes? I mean... You dirty, two-faced fucking fag, don't ever hit me again! Don't! - All right, I think I am gonna... - Go ahead. - Right now. - Go on! I'll tear your fuckin' eyes out! - I'm gonna kill you, bastard! - Go on! Teresa! Teresa. What do you do? Do you know? Johnny! How should I know? She's your fucking girl. - Get over here. - Get off. Teresa? Hey, do you know what to do? Marty had his circle of friends and they loved the picture. They just totally loved it, they saw its originality. I remember the first executive we showed it to... who shall remain nameless, after a few minutes he got up and he said, "Listen, gentlemen, "thanks for bringing it in but this is not gonna work." So he walked out. And so Marty's, like, dying. I'm thinking, "I've put my life savings into something and I'll never get it back." And then we came here, to Warner Bros. And the movie starts and about ten minutes into the movie this waiter arrives. "Who's got the tuna on rye?" And Marty's just, again, dying. This guy's standing right in the middle, the waiter's projected on the screen. And eventually it settles down and... they're starting to laugh cos these are New York guys, they understand that kind of Catholic, Jewish, weird New York humour. And I'm beginning to think, "Well, this is gonna be OK." And then, about two-thirds of the way through the movie, John Calley, who was way up front, gets up and starts to walk back and I thought, "Oh, my God, this is disastrous, he's leaving." And he comes and he sits down next to me and he says, "This is the best movie I've seen all year but I have to take a leak, "would you mind stopping it?" I said, "Sure, what button do I push?" So we stopped and he went out and came back. We finished the movie, he just got up and said, "We're buying it. "I don't want you to sell it to anybody else but us." And so that was... All of sudden we were up. Marty popped two Valiums, he was fine. About three weeks later, we had a meeting with Jay Cocks and Marty and Bob Evans. He was saying, "Why didn't you guys sell this movie to us?" We had to... We had to rat on Peter Bart. Mean Streets opened to ecstatic critical reviews in an era when reviews really made a difference. Well, obviously it was a different time, but there was a sense that film criticism was part of the movement and that film critics were there at the barricades. You know... you know, with the sort of political message of Godard in Week End and La Chinoise. And, you know, it seems rather preposterous today to think of a film critic as part of a political movement. But clearly that's how a lot of us thought of ourselves. But even as the critics brought audiences back into theatres, the studios began to understand what kind of film could really bring money in. It opened in New York and it did very well in New York but then, literally, in the fifth or sixth week that they'd been working it, The Exorcist came out and that just sucked up all the Warner Bros oxygen and that was it, that's where they were gonna take their energies. With The Exorcist, Warner Bros copied Paramount's Godfather strategy - opening the picture all over the country, on hundreds of screens. It was Friedkins' second hit after the hugely successful French Connection and he joined the growing list of directors who could do no wrong. Hollywood now belonged to the auteurs. Eagerly grabbing up these new media stars, Paramount's Charlie Bluhdorn set up the Directors Company with Friedkin, Coppola and Bogdanovich, ignoring industry concern about inflated directorial egos. it was a signal that the producer could be pushed off to the side and the directors were the people responsible for making the picture. Nobody ever suggested the director wasn't the director of the movie. But then, nobody should complain, when you give him 100% freedom, about why the pictures cost so much or why they're not talking to the studio. I think that was a terrible mistake. Coppola's first film for the new company was The Conversation, a small, artful film that took a long time to recoup its relatively small budget. - I didn't mean to tell you on that level. - No, no. Bogdanovich folded his Paper Moon into the new company... What company you from? ..but then stumbled with his follow-up, Daisy Miller. After viewing Daisy Miller and The Conversation, Billy Friedkin bailed on his friends to make the hugely expensive Sorcerer. The picture flopped and seriously damaged Friedkin's career. As the budgets and egos grew, a self-righteous sense of artistic entitlement began separating Hollywood from the rest of the outside world, which was exploding. US involvement with the war was still expanding and the ghettos were still aflame. There were exceptions to this self-involvement. Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson had continued BBS's successful run of films with Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces. But Bert, having conquered Hollywood, turned away from make-believe. Bert felt the need to put his money where his mouth was. He believed in certain things. Hi there. Black power. Bert's involvements with other non-filmic things such as Huey Newton and the Black Panthers, such as Abbie Hoffman, who Bert supported while he was underground... Huey Newton would be at those parties. And I don't know a lot of the specifics but legend has it that he got some guns to the Panthers. In 1974, Bert produced the Academy Award-winning documentary on the Vietnam War, Hearts And Minds. Accepting his Oscar, Schneider read a telegram conveying greetings of friendship to all Americans from Vietnam's revolutionary government. There was a moment of shocked silence before a burst of applause and scattered hisses. Meanwhile, Sam Peckinpah was continuing his politically incorrect ways. After scoring with the violent Wild Bunch, he had alienated women with the sexist Straw Dogs. Sam was like a dog that you love but he's always doing something that kind of embarrasses you. I don't even think Sam would be allowed to get into LA, much less work in LA. He was a total outlaw and one of the last of a breed. He was like one of the Wild Bunch.v There was clearly a case of a real survivor. I mean, Sam had the mentality... He used to, like... He couldn't really create until he was face down in the barroom, dead broke, with everyone laughing at him. Dylan came to see me and by then we had cast Kristofferson. He said, "You know, I gotta tell you that in a past life I was Billy the Kid." So I said, "Well, that's great, Bob, that's why you're in." So two weeks later we flew down to Durango and we went to see Sam. It was late at night, Sam lived kind of outside of town. We walked up towards the house and there was this scream and this maid ran out, just terrified. And we heard a shot. And I thought, "Oh, man, this is gonna blow the whole thing with Bob." Hey, Pete, who's that out there? I knocked on Sam's door, pushed it open and Sam was standing in front of this mirror, completely naked, with a gun in his hand. This mirror was totally blown to hell and he was looking at his reflection and didn't say anything. He had a bottle in one hand and a gun in the other. I said, "Sam, this is Bob Dylan." In the end, Dylan's soundtrack made more money than Peckinpah's film. He was trying to make something good. Unfortunately, so much creative energy, I felt, was expended in fighting the guys who were supposed to be on his side, you know? The studio, the producers or whatever. As the alcoholic Peckinpah fought MGM over his director's cut, a rising star gave one of the boys from Malibu his first studio gig. Ellen Burstyn had just become a big star in Warner Bros' The Exorcist and was offered a picture where she could pick the director. So I called Francis Coppola... and I asked him, "Do you know anybody new and exciting?" He said, "Look at a film called Mean Streets.v" Marty came in and I said, "I loved your movie... "but it's really all about men "and this picture is from a woman's point of view. "And I can't tell from that movie if you know anything about women. Do you?" He said, "No, but I'd like to learn." So I thought that was as good an answer as I could ever imagine. Scorsese surrounded himself with women for Alice, partially to help him artistically, partially to protect himself. He made his girlfriend Sandy Weintraub the associate producer, then hired Toby Rafelson, who'd recently split from husband Bob after he'd become too open about his many sexual infidelities. Finally, George Lucas's wife Marcia came on as editor. - Donald! - That's OK, boy. That's OK, you run! Alice... But in Hollywood the only relationships that seemed to last were between men. At Paramount, Bob Evans, Roman Polanski, Jack Nicholson and Robert Towne were creating a classic noir tale of 1930s Los Angeles, a film made even darker when Polanski, still scarred by his wife's murder, insisted on changing Towne's script to reflect what he saw in reality. Faye Dunaway's character is murdered and her daughter returned to her incestual father Chinatown's artistic success justified the studios' faith in the director as auteur. By the mid-'70s, audiences had returned to the theatres. The Godfather, American Graffiti and The Exorcist were packing them in. A new generation of directors like Coppola, Bogdanovich, Hopper, Penn, Peckinpah, Scorsese and Altman had made movies relevant again with handcrafted films that spoke to modern audiences. But now that the studios had audiences back, did they really have to deal with the huge egos and autocratic control directors demanded? Before the question could be asked, the first cracks were appearing in this auterist utopia. Trouble is the studios think you're infallible. Suddenly you're fallible, you make a mistake, you screw up, they lose some money, then they get nervous about the next one. Peter Bogdanovich stumbled badly with At Long Last Love and Daisy Miller. Dennis Hopper's career was lost in a snowstorm of drugs and paranoia. Now the BBS had essentially shut down, Bob Rafelson watched his directorial ambitions collapse under the weight of The King Of Marvin Gardens and Stay Hungry. And Robert Altman, after four commercial flops, adroitly sidestepped studio indifference to Nashville by involving critic Pauline Kael in editing. Her endorsement made it Altman's last commercial success for many years. What happened to the directors like Peter, like Altman, like Peckinpah... They were doing whatever they wanted, smoking dope, drinking, and they lost their minds. I really think that's what happened. It was the age of excess. We didn't know enough, we were too successful, we probably were somewhat arrogant - I speak for a lot of us - and we made some big mistakes. As the directors started stumbling, Warren Beatty positioned himself to take control. Honey! - My God, it's Lester! Get up, get up! - Doll? - Jackie? - Oh, God. - Uh... - Jackie, you sleeping? Jackie? Jackie? Oh, shut the door, shut the door, honey. - Come on! - Oh. Sorry. Warren had a lot to say about the production, obviously because he was co-writing it and co-producing and actually, it was his baby. Hal was frustrated by it on one level because like most directors, he wanted to be in charge. I don't think he was in charge on that film. Warren is a very unique person, too, and he is so strong, you know, he's... Whatever he has in mind, one way or another, he's gonna get it. So here was this situation between him and Hal, who was also equally very strong. So he said, "OK. We're gonna do my takes first." And we did eight or ten takes. And Hal says, "OK, I'm happy now, let's do whatever." And hey, it was Hal's most successful film. I mean, so, what do you say? Shampoo was so successful it gave Ashby the clout to make his next picture without stars. Bound For Glory was a biography of singer Woody Guthrie and his attempts to help organize poor workers into unions. Ashby, like Guthrie, was uncompromising. The picture soon went far over budget and worse, failed to connect with an audience. The public's taste was changing and it would be fed by one of the movie nerds from Malibu. I was so deeply unaware of what was going on in the studios, I didn't get that part of Steven until later. He did know what was going on at the studios, he was the wunderkind, I think he dropped a year off his age, or a couple, I'm sure he did. Um, cos he started out older than me. Spielberg had become a Universal contract director in TV and had risen out of that ghetto with the TV movie Duel. He was 28 when he started the movie that would change him and the movie business forever. I saw him become a huge character. The demands and pressures that were thrown at him, that were staggeringly difficult and painful and... And he rose... He just did it, he did his job. For a writer it wasn't too tough, except that I was writing a few days ahead of the schedule and I shared a house with Steven so we talked about nothing but the film. I didn't have to go on the water the last two months. Steven, Roy and Ricky were going out every day with Robert and the crew to get maybe 30 seconds of usable film. Bad weather and a recalcitrant mechanical shark drove the picture wildly over budget and behind schedule. Two-thirds of the way through the shoot, the studio flew out to see why the picture was in trouble. They were met by a director who didn't smoke or drink and would set aside his own ego when dealing with studio executives. The result - the Universal suits went back to Hollywood and Spielberg finished his film. I left the shoot on a Wednesday, after six months we were wrapping. We still had a couple of more shots, including the shot which exploded the shark. Roy Scheider goes bam and the shark... A pretty involved and intricate shot. So I had flown to Boston and I met Steven in Boston and got on the plane with him to LA and I said, "So how did the shot go?" He said, "They're doing it now." I said, "Well, why aren't you there?" And he kind of gave me this insane grin and he had bailed, he'd just said, "I can't do this." He had put that shot in the hands of his AD and he had skipped, which was his way of going completely insane. While Spielberg and editor Verna Fields assembled the shark movie, some of the other Malibu film makers were slipping a dark nightmare through the studio gates. I had gone to UCLA film school. I'd gone to the AFI the very first year it began, when it was all free, and then a number of things had fallen apart in my life. I was in debt, I wasn't making any money, marriage had fallen apart, I had left the AFI in protest over some of their policies. So I really didn't have much of a place to go or much of a life. I took to wandering and kind of drifting around. And it was out of that period of drifting, and drinking, that, uh... l, um... started having this pain and finally went to the hospital and I had an ulcer. 26 years old. I realized in the emergency area that I hadn't spoken to anybody in weeks. I'd just been drifting around in this car, sleeping in my car. And so the metaphor of the taxi driver came to me. De Niro. In Bang The Drum Slowly, the critics called him a brilliant new talent. After Mean Streets, they said he was a genius. For his performance in The Godfather Part II, they gave him the Academy Award. Just get me out of here, all right? Now Robert De Niro creates a terrifying portrait of life on the edge of madness. Driver, just forget about this, it's nothin'. A film by Martin Scorsese. People will do anything in front of a taxi driver. - People too cheap to rent a hotel room. - Driver, hurry up. People wanna embarrass you. It's like you're not even there, you don't even exist. This city here is like an open sewer, it's full of filth and scum. I think I know what you mean, Travis. The script banged around Hollywood and everyone said, "This is really good, "somebody should make it but not us." And then things started coming together, Michael and Julia got a Best Oscar for The Sting, Marty had a hit with Alice Doesn't Live Here, Bobby got an Oscar for Godfather II, and all of a sudden at $2 million... Uh... Begelman and Julia Phillips were friends and Julia said, "Somebody should make this, why don't you?" And he finally said, "Why not? OK." he had every kind of asthma condition, he was just afraid of being chewed up by the system, he'd obviously been banged around in some of his film making experiences and just wanted to get through with his work without being too badly mauled. In order to get a green light from the studio Phillips and Scorsese went forward with what they knew was an inadequate budget. We were the Enron of Columbia Pictures at that time. We kept the truth hidden, we made promises, then we'd go out and shoot something we said we were gonna drop. They would freak out. "You're not authorized to shoot this." "Sorry, sorry. It's OK, we thought we could do it on the same day." You know, just playing a role. For Taxi Driver, the boys from Malibu Beach closed ranks protectively around Scorsese. Cybill Shepherd was practically visiting royalty. She came because the studio wanted one more name in the cast. At the time I had two offers at Columbia Pictures. I had Taxi Driver and I had, um... Nickelodeon and David Begelman said I couldn't do both. I talked to Peter and we both agreed. I said, "I need to do Taxi Driver," because we were no longer reviewed for our work after At Long Last Love, Peter and I. We were so obnoxious in the press. "Look at us, we're in love and we don't have to be married." That was a revolutionary premise then. We were the first couple to be on the cover of a magazine that were living in sin. Her partner's film, Nickelodeon made money for Columbia but not enough to reverse the perception that Bogdanovich had lost his touch. In a business where perception is everything, Steven Spielberg's shark film was about to change Hollywood's perception of what success really meant. I... Had I seen it? No, I guess I hadn't seen it yet. I was in New York and the studio had told me... the film was gonna be shown at the Rivoli Theater on such and such a night. So I go down to the Rivoli Theater and there's 1,500 or 2,000 people. So we start watching this movie. Now, I'm in the movie. And I forgot that I was in it. I was so swept up in the fear and the storytelling, I completely forgot that that was me. I had no idea... I was appropriately terrified and scared, it was incredible. And then... then the audience did something that I had never heard. Ever. Maybe it had been done before but... The movie ends and the entire building erupts in a sound that was extraordinary. Screaming, yelling, applauding, yelling, screaming. Gevalt! - That's a 20-footer. - 25. Three tons of him. You're gonna need a bigger boat, right? Gotta get to work. How do we handle this? - How do we handle this? - I need you. He's circling the boat! Come on, come on. Lew Wasserman, Sid Scheinberg, Henry H, Hi Martin and Charlie Powell - Martin was head of distribution, Powell was head of marketing and publicity - met in the men's room of the theatre cos it was the only place they could talk. And Wasserman said, "Put it out to as many screens as we can get." And they went for 1,200 screens which, at that time, was unheard of. This was a big decision to try to take Jaws and put it out there like they used to do with exploitation pictures. Exploitation pictures were meant to come in, make a lot of money before anybody noticed how bad they were and get out. When I saw Jaws, I thought, "Uh-oh. These guys understand "what I and my contemporaries are doing "and they have the money and the talent and skill "to do them bigger and better." By the winter of '75/'76, Universal's Jaws had rolled up $100 million at the box office. It was the first motion picture in history to do so. Everyone knew everything had changed. Taxi Driver opened later that year to ecstatic reviews and decent business. But decent business wasn't enough any more. The age of the blockbuster had arrived and as the grosses climbed, the pressures mounted. So did the casualties. I started using cocaine and amphetamines way before the success and in fact had had quite a bit of success working behind it and I was thinking yesterday, things I might say about it and there was a definite progression that went from using it as a tool to using it as a crutch and then it became you weren't using it for anything, it was life itself. In the new Hollywood, Julia Phillips was just one of the legion of movie professionals for whom cocaine was a perk and a tool. When I was directing Blue Collar and I was in preproduction, the producer at that time, Hal Schneider, came into my office, put a vial on my desk and said, "Here, this'll help you work longer." You know, and it was almost medicinal. There was a time in Hollywood where you could see people snorting coke in public. And you could see people snorting coke in public who you knew, who were... You know, they had authority, they had responsibility. Now, I'm... You know, at that time I was completely over my head. We went to an AFI tribute for Alfred Hitchcock, one year during his period. I went to the men's room and I swear to God, under every single stall there was at least six or eight legs. The sound of snorting was so loud, it was like a joke and there was this one kind of old washroom attendant sitting there trying to hand out towels and it was comical. Here's old Alfred Hitchcock up there getting his life achievement award and all the Hollywood hoi polloi are in there snorting cocaine. It was crazy. As drugs overran the Hollywood social scene, the movies themselves began to be affected. This was the beginning of, also, the craziness for everyone. Fresh off the critical success of Taxi Driver, Scorsese could do anything he wanted. His choice - an almost impossible blending of golden-age Hollywood musical and Cassavetes-like emotional catharsis. Well, New York, New York... reflects the unique state of mind that Marty was in at that time. He was having terrible trouble with his marriage with Julia, um, he was having an affair with Liza Minnelli, he was staying up all night, he had pushed it to the edge of the envelope. The private life is kinda screwed up, so you begin to live in the fast lane because you want to kind of get some benefit out of where you are but you can't because your work is always... They're always in the back of your head with a gun, you know? They want, they pay you - deliver. All this emotional chaos and everybody doing too much cocaine didn't help solve the artistic problems. Marty was very clever, that we started with the musical numbers. So two weeks, that's all we shot. When we finished, he invited for screening Vincente Minnelli, everybody. Just a big gala, like it was a wrap party, you know. And they showed this - I don't know - about 15-, 20-minute musical number. And it was... I was even surprised, it was fabulous. You know, moving and all great songs. And from that point on, the studio gave Marty anything. I didn't know that this was kind of Drugs R Us... going on on this movie. You know, I wasn't... At the time I'd never tried drugs so I didn't know what it smelt like, looked like or what people were like when they were on it. Ultimately, Scorsese kicked the drugs and recovered. Some didn't. In the deserts of Nevada, Sam Peckinpah was driving Convoy off the road. Cocaine and booze was a big problem and that would certainly explain a lot of the delays. I was on the wagon then and Sam wasn't and I would stay pretty much in my trailer, I didn't wanna get in trouble. They actually fired him at one point and I told them that I would walk if he weren't kept on the film. We were standing outside the saloon, the truck stop where the fight was and he came up behind me and said, "You son of a bitch! I was outta here!" And I said, "You son of a bitch, you got me into here!" You know? He was in rough shape. Time after time, he would ruin himself financially, ruin his personal life, ruin his reputation, so he could do this whole phoenix act. Er... It didn't work with cocaine. He did fall flat down, face down on the floor with cocaine, only this time he couldn't get up. A different drug. William Blake said, "The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom". It also leads to the grave. Sam Peckinpah made one more picture, the compromised Osterman Weekend before dying of heart failure at the age of 59 in Mexico. Most said he was the victim of his own excesses. People can always say you're your own victim but... Sometimes people have great talent which has to be nourished in some way and if this industry can't nourish it they become victims and then their self-indulgence sometimes takes over and nobody pulls 'em up and pulls 'em out. I mean, if you write screenplay after screenplay, deal after deal, that you see fall apart and go away and so on, and you never lose your enthusiasm for wanting to make film, you're a victim, that's all. Malibu resident- producer-provocateur Julia Phillips would drive the drug scene underground when she publicly flamed out on Steven Spielberg's follow-up to Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Julia and I were pretty terrible but as far as I was concerned, in the midst of Julia's chazerai craziness, she also was a hard worker. Julia fought the battles on this. We were divorced at this time and she ran into problems, as everybody knows, late in the postproduction and, er... Drug problems - and had to be removed and I got back on and worked with Steven to finish the film. Some years later, she wrote a book. So, I go to the book store. I'm reading what Julia is writing about me and I am getting seriously angry. Seriously furious. And I'm gonna kill her! And I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that. And all of a sudden, I hear this little voice and the voice inside my head is saying, "Richard, "what really happened was so much worse. "Leave it alone." And I left it alone. I didn't know Julia in the last few years of her life. I don't know. She wasn't happy. She wasn't in good circumstances. But I never hated her for that. You know, I was... I was there. I did that stuff. Drugs and excess may have derailed some of the new generation but it was nothing compared to the success of the easily promotable B-movies that audiences were embracing. But this was a new kind of B-movie. Instead of a low-budget programmer to fit the bottom of a double bill, these were expensive, effects-driven pictures like Close Encounters that could endanger a studio if they failed. In England and in computer labs in California, George Lucas was quietly laboring on the ultimate B-movie. So from American Graffiti, George got to make a $13 million movie, which was a huge budget in those days, it was giant. He called and he said, "You know, I don't think it's gonna work at Fox." And I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "They're not going to give me the rights to any sequels." I said, "George, sequels? You're lucky to get $13 million for this movie!" He said, "No, I wanna control it, I want the sequels." And he held firm and he ended up owning the rights to Star Wars. He said, "I'm gonna make more money by making science fiction toys, "I'm gonna make more money than The Godfather "by making science fiction toys." He hated directing, George did, because he got sick all the time, he had diabetes and he just wasn't very sturdy and he got sick. And he always would talk and he'd say, "Porno. That's the answer. "It's a warm room. "If you don't get the right location you go get another, "people don't care what room, as long as it's a pretty nice room." So if he hadn't done Star Wars or American Graffiti, he would probably own this huge porno network today. He'd probably be even richer than he is. At the first rough cut screening of Star Wars, the directorial division of opinion would foretell the future of movies. George asked his friends to see a rough cut of Star Wars. It was hard to watch because it was... The special effects, nothing was there yet. What we saw was very crude World War II footage where the effects would be. And even for experienced people, it takes a lot to look at a rough cut. Brian De Palma was particularly sarcastic. "What's this crap about the Force? When did the Force...?" You know. But George listened and he took it good-naturedly and the only one who was optimistic was Spielberg. He said, "I think it's great, it's gonna make $100 million." We thought, "Steve's just Steve," you know. Energetic kid. Once he started screening it, it was like American Graffiti, the audiences just went nuts. Hollywood, California. August 1977. A triumphant moment in screen history. To the world-famous Chinese Theatre come the stars of the biggest box-office success in motion picture history. The financial success of Star Wars would, with The Exorcist, Jaws and Close Encounters essentially end the epoch of the director-driven film and begin the era of the big-budget B-movie where studios could open a film everywhere with nationwide ad campaigns and fast payoffs. It almost didn't matter if the film was good or not, as long as it made a great trail. Thousands gather to see the metallic megastars place their footprints in cement in the courtyard. As the two heroes of Star Wars make their impressions on the ground reserved for legends, the world resounds the fact that Star Wars has become a full-fledged social phenomenon. It has become more than just a movie. Star Wars was the ultimate triumph of the B-movie. It had taken a decade for the studios to regain their dominance and find their new audience with effects-driven sci-fi horror films, ironic superheroes and sequels. Endless sequels. The era of the director - brief era of the director - came to a conclusion, really, by the end of the '70s, if not sooner. It was sort of petering out. They started feeding off the mechanism of what was making money, so that they wouldn't be in the position of having film makers walking in and saying, "You don't know what makes money, I do, I'll make the movie." So finally, they were able to say, "Yes, we do know what makes money "and you will make it for us." I mean, the system allowed these artists to create and then, when it became... essentially, conglomerates took over the studios, everything changed. I think the thing that killed, for me, movies, more than anything, was the event of Entertainment Tonight, when they started doing box-office scores like football scores. And I remember the first weekend they did it, or the first Monday - this film was first and this film was second - and I looked at that screen and I said, "We're over." In 1979, director Marty Scorsese, exhausted and convinced his career was over, decided to leave Hollywood. But, urged on by Robert De Niro, Scorsese summoned up one last primal scream of defiance. ..clean shots. How he can survive 'em, nobody knows. No man can endure this pummeling. The fight is stopped.
