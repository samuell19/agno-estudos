Maybe we should go over this thing again... ...of you getting out and involving yourself with people. It's Friday night, the most social night of the week. A couple of lookers like us should be out there enjoying the night life. You're sitting here moping in the dark like-- A vampire? Well, yeah. I was gonna say slacker, but, yeah, to you, Mr. Obvious. - You gotta come out, man. - Why? Because I think we deserve a night of fun. It breaks up those nights of death and mayhem. Plus, we could toast to new business. The three of us. Doyle, if you want to ask Cordelia out, just do it yourself. I don't even know if she likes me. Put in a good word for me. Tell her what a great guy I am. - I barely know you. - Perfect, that should make it easier. Hello? When you're talking me up to her, whatever you do... ...don't let her in on me being half demon. Women get a little funny about that. They're finally in! They're in. Okay. - Your cards. - The cards. Your cards to leave with people so they can reach you. Great idea. You don't have a signal folks can shine when they need help. Look at that. There's our number. It's right next to... ...a butterfly? It's obviously not a butterfly, you idiot. It's a bird. No, it's an owl. A bird that hunts at night. Brilliant. It's an angel. An angel. Right. It's an angel. So obvious, and yet so clever on so many levels. - Shut up. - Jesus. Don't be a baby. I barely hit you. Doyle? - You okay, man? - I'm okay. Sit up. What'd you see? What'd you see? It's a bar. I think I recognize it. One of those terminally stuck in the '80s places. Yeah, and...? No faces popped out at me, man. Just a feeling. What feeling? Something's gonna happen. Looks like you got your wish. We're going out. Excuse me. - May I? - What? Oh. Sure. Please. Kevin. Sharon. God, I really hate places like this. Don't you? When I was a kid I thought, "You grow up, you meet her... ...and everything falls in place." Yeah, I had that. Only I had a him where you had a her. Really I just had a Ken and a Barbie. Ken and Barbie had it easy. They didn't have to come to places like this. But you gotta try. I mean, what if she was here and you missed her... ...because you were too, I don't know... ...burned out to still believe. You know what I mean? I know exactly what you mean. You have to believe that someday you'll meet someone special. I think I have. Oh, God, I can't believe I just said that. You are, but it sounded so-- No, it sounded nice, Kevin. Ooh, classy. Okay, now what? Split up. Look for someone who might be in trouble. Or something that's about to cause it. What can I get you? Just wondering, you noticed anything unusual here tonight? Unusual? You know, out of the ordinary. Possibly even dangerous? It's early yet. The real hot women don't mosey in till around 11. Hi. If you're in trouble, just call this number. We can help. Hi. Being harassed by someone or something? Dial us up, day or night. Hey, you look troubled. Or is that just your lazy eye? Call us. We're very discreet. Hi. How are you? Hey. This isn't a marketing seminar, princess. We need to operate more below radar. What radar? The police. The service our friend Angel provides might make them think of the "V" word. - Vampire? - No, vigilante. There's laws against that sort of thing. You need to be a little bit more casual-like. "Hi, what's your name?" "How's life?" "Minions from hell getting you down?" Excuse me, but I am an actress. A student of the human animal. I don't need talk to know their story. Jazz hands over there? Mama's boy. Peter Pan complex. Self-absorbed with a big "the world owes me" chip on her shoulder. Check out "Sarah, Plain and Tall." Has or comes from big money. How do you know? You gotta be rich to snag the guy she's leaving with. All riveting insights, but we need to find someone that's in trouble. How's Angel doing? Seriously, I wasn't hitting on you. Are you okay? - What? - Oh, nothing. Sorry. Am I okay? Well, you just looked bad. You don't look bad, you look very nice. I'm just gonna have my drink. Thanks. For thinking you look bad or good? You choose. I'm Angel. I'm Kate. Do you come here a lot? No, it's the first time. It's-- Easy? Yeah. I prefer those cool bars that are hard to get into, but I can't get in. Anyway, this is close to home. So did you just stop in? - I'm looking for something. - I'm keeping you-- No, no. I'm just looking for someone to rescue. Are you in need of some rescuing? That's the strangest line I'll hear tonight. No, no, it's not a line, I'm-- Oh, I didn't mean-- That was harsh. You know, I'm not very good at this talking. I'm the expert, I'm sure you see. But no, I don't need rescuing. I gave up on "knight in shining armor" a while ago. I don't expect to find him at the International House of Posers. People can surprise you. I sound like a big hypocrite, don't I? Ragging on this place? I come here every night. How else you gonna meet somebody outside of work? It's this... ...or sit home alone in the dark. Wouldn't want that. So, what do you do? - Do? - For a living. Well, basically, I'm.... I help-- I'm a veterinarian. Really? I always say a man that loves animals is a man you can trust. You got everyone figured out? Not everyone. I mean, you I don't get. Me? What's with those visions of yours? They're messages I get from the higher powers, whoever they are. - It's my gift. - If that was my gift, I'd return it. You get those headaches and then you do this thing with your face. - What thing with my face? - Plus, your visions are lame. A bar? That's nice and vague. They should send you one of those self-destructing tapes with a dossier. - I'll be sure to mention it. - Hey! You the one handing out these cards? Do you need help? Do you mind if I ring you up some time for a date? - Yeah, she minds. - I can handle this. Yes, I mind. This is a business card. Our services are for people in need. I might need a little service. You charge by the hour? Excuse me?! Just relax here a little bit. The lady's with me. - No, I'm not! - Nobody's talking to you, wipe. Well, I guess I just.... I just have a hard time, you know, trusting people. Male people, particularly. In a place like this, nobody will show you who they really are. Everybody's too busy trying to get whatever it is they're looking for. - What are you looking for? - Depends how many daiquiris I've had. Oh, God, way to come off like a drunken slut. Slut's better than a hypocrite, right? I'm moving up? You're kind of hard on yourself. I'm a self-flagellating hypocrite slut. What was your question? What are you looking for? I'm just trying to make a connection. The more I come to places like this, the harder it gets. What are you looking for in here? I honestly don't know. I'll know it when I see it. Would you? - I'm sorry, forget it. - What? I was gonna ask if you wanted to go someplace... ...more quiet. I can't. I have to stay here. Right. - I would.... - No, that's okay. Listen, I don't want any trouble, okay? - What's the trouble? - No trouble. I said we didn't want any trouble. We are trouble-free. She's a hooker and her pimp is giving me a hard time. - That's it! - Down, Cord. Did you hear that? Simmer down here. Violence is not gonna solve a thing, all right? Though it's kind of festive. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God. Those jerks started it. Hey, not a word. Every time with you guys. Out. Come on, let's go. - Wow. Are you okay? - I'm fine, thanks. I'm okay. Are you okay? Well, now, that's for you to find out. I'd really like to know. So, how do you want to do this? Twenty questions? Marcie from Barstow. That doesn't even rhyme or anything. It's wild, us meeting over a bar fight. Isn't it great when two people make a connection? It's late. Yeah. - I should-- - I know. Well.... Well, I mean, if you have to leave, I understand. But I'd just like to hold you. I'm having a hard time believing the vision meant I was to come here... - ...and break up a bar fight. - If it was... ...I'm in for some serious workman's comp. Did you sense anybody here needed help? Yeah, everybody. This socializing thing is brutal. I was young once. I went to bars. - It was never like this. - I used to go to taverns, man. Small towns. Everybody used to know each other. Like high school. It's easy to date. We all had so much in common. Being monster food, for instance. You're in the big bad city now. Where everyone's a stranger. Hiding behind walls. Keeping secrets. Sorry. Gotta kick you out now. Sure. The single life's really hard for you. Why? Before, you only had to worry about a hangover. Now because of your curse thingy, you can't sleep with anyone... ...or you might feel true happiness and lose your soul... ...become evil again and kill everyone. I always appreciate your perspective. No problem. The last thing I want is to show up at the office... ...and find that I'm working for a homicidal monster. This is whacked. I don't know what I'm looking for. You're looking for anything in and around that bar. I'm in the newsgroup search engine. What's the name? D'Oblique. Capital D, apostrophe-- Not so fast. Okay, capital D. Apostrophe, apostrophe, apostrophe.... Oh, I got it. Okay, now what's after that again? I need a break. Let me get in here. How'd you get computer skills? Downloading pictures of naked women? That's more or less accurate. Hello. We got two hits. Look: "Search continues for Heather Nolan. Missing since late last month, the 24-year-old paralegal... ...vanished after leaving D'Oblique." Missing girl. That's up your alley. What's the second one say? "A badly mutilated body found nearly three weeks ago... ...described by the coroner's office as eviscerated... ...has been identified as 28-year-old Martin Haber. Last seen with an unidentified female at D'Oblique, a singles bar." Probably been more disappearances not traced back to the bar yet. We got a missing girl and a stiff. An eviscerated stiff. Use the library. Narrow down a list of eviscerating demons who'd prey on young singles. - Where are you going? - The bar. See if I can meet a killer. Excuse me. - Well, hello. - Hi. Kate. - I'm glad to see you again. - Really? I owe you an apology for last night. You don't owe me anything. It was rude. Okay, then... ...maybe you can buy me a drink and we can start fresh. You shouldn't go in there tonight. What do you mean? I'm not sure it's safe. What's not safe? I can't really explain it. I have a problem trusting people, and you're not making it any better. - I'm asking you not to go. - Where are you going? In there. Well, I'll tell you what. I can go wherever I want, and you can go to hell. Been there, done that. - The usual? - Thanks. You know, some guys have got real problems. I'm sorry, you were saying? Oh, nothing. It's just my job. You know, it's hard... ...to meet people. I mean, everybody is watching their own back. It's tough... ...knowing who you can trust. Still, I'm surprised. I'd think you could have your pick of girls. Yeah? I don't know. I was pretty much a spaz in high school. I mean a real "something's out there" geek... ...with a gang of geektoid minions. I couldn't get a date to save my life. It's good high school's over. Yeah. Where's Kevin? Hell if I know. I haven't seen him. Dude didn't come to work today, and he's not answering his phone. Pretty sure he hooked up last night. - Probably sleeping it off. - What girl? You know what, here's another one: "Piasca." It's a flesh-eating Indian demon... ...that enters victims through the mouth and eviscerates from within. - You gonna put that one down? - Yep. Demons. Is there anything more disgusting? You think so? Come on. Look at this one. This demon wears a wreath of intestines around its head. What kind of statement is that? It really depends, doesn't it? Demons could be actually nice, given the opportunity. You'd have to get to know them. I've known a lot of demons, and, slime aside... ...not a lot there. Sharon. Her name is Sharon. - Counter regular. - Sharon. That dowdy chick. Kevin. Scraping the bottom of the barrel. - Look, where can I find Sharon? - She's here tonight. No Kevin, though. Guess it wasn't true love after all. She was just there with some screech. That's more her level. - Any idea where she lives? - No. - What about a last name? - Last name? Not a lot of last names in a place like this. It's Reichler. I asked her out a couple times. I'm sorry. I wanted this to go better. Maybe I was trying too hard. I just really like you. Next time it'll be better. Roll over. Okay. This is nice. I think sometimes-- You're not human. News flash, pal. You're a bit off the evolutionary chart, yourself. This has to stop You have to stop. I will when I find the right one. The one I can stay with. The right body? What's wrong with this one? Nothing. Yet. It's new and different. It's great. But it won't last. I already know it's not the one. It'll be the one you die in. What are you doing here? I know what this looks like. So do I. - You have the right-- - I waive it. - How'd you find me? - I've been tracking you. Don't move. Not a step. - Backup is on the way. - We're on the same side. - I'm after him too. - You're an investigator? More or less. Where's your license? - That's the less part. - Right. You didn't see-- What I see is the carving job of an impotent sicko. It's frustrating, isn't it? Not being able to connect? To love like other people? How do you get them to trust you? Give them the "I'm not good with talking" speech? He gives them what they're longing for. - And that is? - Hope. That their loneliness might end. He'll keep doing it. Unless I let you go so you can stop him. Save me the lines. I've heard them. I've heard yours. Not being able to trust people? Turn around. - I'm sorry. - Is that a confession? I didn't do that. I'm sorry for this. Wow, this place is.... I thought girls liked pretty things. Don't start. Angel told us to meet here... ...so we are. That doesn't mean-- That is so high school. "Cordelia wears bras. She has girl parts." Take it easy. You're defensive. It's refreshing to see a woman living like this. You're not so uptight. You live for the moment. You're disgusting. - Who is it? - It's me. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Look, I can't-- Invite him in. If you're alive... ...vampires can't cross the threshold. - Promise you'll stay good? - Cordelia. I'm kidding. Come in. What the hell happened to you? That woman that I was talking to at the bar last night, Kate. - She's the killer? - She's a cop. - Followed me to another body. - She thinks you did it. So we don't have a lot of time-- - You actually live here? - Yes, okay? Is it my fault maid service was interrupted? It was supposed to go, home, hotel, hotel, husband. Now can we move on? We put together that list of eviscerating demons you asked for. - We narrowed-- - I saw it. It's a burrower. It's a donkey? We didn't see any donkey demons. - Burrower. - Oh. It eviscerates its victims as it goes from body to body... ...and maybe only after some kind of a sex act, exchange of fluids thing. Lovely. Find out anything you can about this thing, weaknesses. It was amazingly strong. It may be hard to kill. - Hey, we're on it. - Good. I'm going back to the bar. But it knows you're after it. It'll be out there. It's gotta keep trying to make the connection. Why? Because that's what lonely people do. - Morning. - Hey. - Any luck, yet? - No, not yet. I know I'd recognize it if I saw it in another body. That narrows it down to about, what, five million suspects in the city? Did you find anything? Yeah, we found a name for this burrower guy. Talamour? He's been around forever. A dawn-of-time kind of dude. - Any weaknesses? - Few and far between. This kid is strong, like you said. He's not too crazy about fire, though. Something we have in common. It's a parasite, and when it starts to leave one body for the next... ...not gonna gag here, but the first one goes gerploohy. Curdles like cream on a hot day. I covered that with nondairy gerploohy. I'm gonna need help to find this thing. - Who are you calling? - Kate. I thought we were hiding from her. She's been tracking this thing a lot longer than we have. - Lockley. - It's me, Help me find the killer. I'm talking to him. That would make things nice and clean, But it's not true, and I think some part of you knows. He's still out there. We should share information. - That's not possible. - All I need is five minutes. If you still think I'm your man, arrest me. Meet me at the bar at 1, That's on my to-do list: Walk into a serial killer's trap. I don't care if you come armed, wired and covered by sharpshooters. I can help you, Kate. You just have to trust me. The usual? That's not your usual. I'm in the mood for something different. You know that guy, tall, nice-looking, helped out in the bar fight? Sure. Sure. - Let me know when he's here. - Yeah, you bet. Thanks. I hate places like this, don't you? I do, but.... I guessed that. You don't look like you're in your element here. Which is a compliment, by the way. Thanks. Look, I would love to chat, but actually... - ...I'm waiting for someone. - That guy. I think he's in the alley. - What is he doing? - I took out the trash and there he was. - Looked like he was ready to rabbit. - Show me. Sorry. You'll have to keep trolling. Call this number. Tell the sergeant I need-- Can you move? Move! I guess you're done with that body. It's tough being a guy. You don't get to finish, you come apart at the seams. I can't let him go. He's not gonna leave. He's gonna kill again, now. - You think so? - He has to. Hey. How's it going? I was noticing your grace... ...and wondering if you were a dancer, because I wish I could move-- Hey, excuse me, that's really a beautiful dress you're wearing. It really brings out your skin tone. Now what? Would you like a drink or something? I'm, like, the bartender here. Just want to talk to somebody. Open up. Want to make a connection. We're going out that window. It's almost 20 feet up. Who are you? Please, I just want to hold you. Run! It all seems to add up. He was connected to everyone. I talked to him a dozen times. I never had a clue. It's hard to get to know people. Yes, it is. I didn't thank you for saving my life. Saving mine was a start. I think you should know I searched your place. Illegally. No warrant. - Why are you telling me? - I don't know. I guess so we can start fresh. No secrets. That's some weird stuff for a veterinarian. If you ever need me, or if I can help you in any way.... What is this, a lobster? I'll be around. Detective Lockley? May I speak with you? Yes, sir. What's up? You've been working hard... ...cooped up inside a lot. To show my appreciation, I was thinking... ...the night being, you know, young and all, that the three of us... ...could, well, should maybe... ...go out. You know... ...for fun. Or we can go home. And you could sit in the dark, alone. God, yes. Thank you.
