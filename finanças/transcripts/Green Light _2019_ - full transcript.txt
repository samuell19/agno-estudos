Yeah, I've been asked to contact this young guy. We're gonna get his exact age and everything as we talk, it's just part of the data gathering process, but I think he's 18. This guy is 18 and he's got bowel cancer and he's had a bowel resection. So for... Do you mind if I just grab this phone call? Kid going wild in there. Hello, it's Luke here. Hello Luke, this is Tara. I assume that you're calling me looking for some kind of assistance -related to the work that I do -yeah. That George has probably told you about. - I need to tell her. - Well, well my mum's been, she's been given just a little bit of time to live. Can I, I just wanna, you've caught me at a at a really interesting time. I'm making a documentary about the difficulties that people are facing accessing medical cannabis and why they have to come and seek people like us out and just the guys are actually filming me right now. Can I proceed to have a chat with you now while they're filming me? How do you feel about that? Okay, so I'll just grab some notes here if you don't mind. We just found out yesterday. So if I start crying, then... - It's okay. - Yeah. She's pretty young, she's only 65. I heard that there's a cannabis oil that is cancer-fighting and then there's another one as well. I dunno the differences. With the oils that we have, be it CBD or THC or a blend of both. I need to let you know that THC itself can have some really strong psychoactive effects and some people find that really unpleasant. So I'm gonna ask that we stay in touch. Well my only like huge worry is that she's in a nursing home, like, I'm just worried like if they do a blood test or something, It's gonna come back on us. Are we going against the law? Like I don't want to go to jail, you know? You could go through a process called the Special Access Scheme. It does prove very difficult for a lot of people to access that. That's why I exist. Some people have often passed away waiting for approval. I can't promise you and I think it would be really bad, a duty of care for me to do so is to promise you that we can cure her cancer. What I have seen is people's cancers go into remission. We've certainly had doctors and oncologists say that they've never seen results like this. And how soon do you think we can get things from you? It'll be a matter of days. Okay, thank you so much. - Okay, all right. - All right, all right. Okay, thanks very much. - Thank you, bye. - Okay. It's my kid, hang on one second. Hey darling. Hi dad. How are you, sweetheart? I'm good, thank you. Look, we started making the documentary today. - Hi. - Hi. This is Wild Rose. What does Wild Rose think of the hemp and the cannabis revolution? I think that it's a really good idea and that the government is not very smart for taking it away. Hey, I'll give you a call. Let's talk after school. - Okay, bye. - Have a great day. - Bye. - Bye. I get up at about-00,- 30, check my emails, check my texts. Normally there's at least three or four messages from people that need help. It's just so I can keep track of who's got what. How many names in there? Most of them are either dying or they've been told they're gonna die or they're in serious pain. They can't handle the opiates anymore. And they've all been reading about medicinal cannabis and how it can help them. If I just put my finger in, he'll strike and bite onto the end of it. So I've gotta be quicker than him and let him know that I'm the alpha creature and then he'll submit. There we go, now he knows. Yeah, there we go. He has submitted. Give him a pat, give him a pat. I sold my house and took a year off to start this service. I gave away medicine completely free for a year. Get off, get off. Get off? Quickly the service grew to hundreds and then thousands of people and that meant that I didn't really have a day off for years. Dude, come on now, serious? Can I have it now? I want to pet it. There was a lot of tension in our household. My partner wore some of the sideways effects of not being able to process that fully and myself. Is that all done? - Is what all done? - Are you all done? I'm not all done, but you can come out with me and we'll feed the goats together, okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. I didn't really have a day off for years. I had no nine to five boundaries. Let's go, mate, this way. Where are you taking us? It could start as early as between five and eight in the morning and it would finish most nights, 10 or 11. Here they come. Those are work hours that I got used to in the hospitality industry when I owned multiple hospitality ventures. My boy wasn't getting the time with me that he deserved. So as he started to become more interested in me, I've made the changes necessary. That's a 10 mil tube of CBD oil. It's a pure hemp, whole plant extract. 10 mils of that comes in and around 260, $280. I've got a pretty good support network around me. I've got a very loving and caring partner who I confide in. I've got three beautiful daughters, my ex-wives, and a little boy about to be born. But yeah, look, there's highs and lows. I got a text from a woman yesterday who's got a little kid that's got epilepsy and you know, they've been going through years and years of seizures and one tube of that has completely changed their life. At the same time, I've had to say goodbye to quite a few patients. You know, and you definitely build up a rapport with them on the phone. I think it's just made me stronger and I'm a pretty tough guy most of the time, yup. I got an email about two weeks ago from a gentleman that was referred to me. I explained to him the process and costs that were involved and he said to me, "I can't afford anything like that. I don't really have much money." And I said, "I'm really sorry to hear that." I said, "Look, can you send me a photo of yourself and the tumor so we can have a look at it?" So he sent me a photo and that's the photo. When I saw that, my heart just sank. How can this guy walk around feeling like that and looking like that? I mean, could you imagine walking into a shop or, you know looking at your partner or your family having this horrible growth on the side of your head? So I forwarded that onto Luke. Good day, see you later. - Hey Lukie. - How are you, man? - Good. - I've got one I've got one for topical and one for internal. - Okay. - I don't wanna actually do the application. I give people suggestions and then they decide what to do with it. Yeah, I think that's a really good idea. Okay, well do you wanna give me a call then when you're just coming past the cop shop? All right, see you soon. I started hairdressing when I was 15 and then embarked on a pretty successful career as a freelance hairstylist and makeup artist. But compared to what I do now, it wasn't really fulfilling. I felt this calling to get out there and help people. If I put it up here, it might go in his ear. Yeah, no, you don't want it running off. It's a precious and expensive medicine, so. Just tell me if it hurts. It doesn't hurt. They're saying there's no nerve endings on the tumor. So it's taken you a couple of years to find us? Yeah because it's an unsightly looking thing, I don't go out during the day. But if I do go anywhere, it's in the car and I usually have a bandage over it that I tape on. And yeah. So it's like the house becomes like a prison for me. It does bleed quite profusely. I don't know if he knocks it or whatever, but like quite -a substantial amount of blood -yeah, sometimes I pick - at it and it bleeds. - Will come out. That's the only time it bleeds. - It's my fault. - When's your mum back? 15th I think. - 14th. - 14th? Well, I haven't seen a doctor for a couple of years now. Yeah, the main one was the oncologist. It was straight into hospital, chop it off. He wouldn't even look at the information I took out there about other possible treatments. It was a terrible experience going up there. The room was just packed with people, mainly older people and yeah, they just all go through the burn, poison or cut procedure. I understand and respect that you said that. At this point, you're not open to it. -Look, but if you do, -Yeah? I guess it would be valuable to find a doctor. I have seen good results across a broad spectrum of therapy. So just so you know that there are those things - available to you. - Okay. I'm gonna do this. Yeah, exactly. Beautiful, perfect. So what we'd ask of you is to keep a diary about the effects that you are feeling and we just monitor you as we go along. Okay, thanks so much for having us. Yes, thank you. - Thanks, Luke. - Really appreciate it. - Yeah, thanks Nick. - Your welcome. - Lovely to meet you. - No fuss. - Thanks fellas. - You're welcome. That's heavy. You did that really well. Oh, what's that fucking smell? - What is that? - It's foul. Oh, is that me or you? Tell me it's you, tell me it's you not me. Yes, it's you. I have to remain really neutral about the potential health outcomes that can happen here. I don't get myself excited. As you see, I'll try and be really clear about what the boundaries are because otherwise I'm carrying this person's excitement in my own being and hoping this amount of hope, you know? And then I know so many people that have died now. Hi, how you doing? Good, good. This is a strategic meeting in support of compassionate access schemes for medical cannabis patients to be able to care for themselves. We've got lawyers and doctors, we've got people like us, providers. So I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out of this. It's an exciting meeting because there's been a lot of talk and not a lot of action and we're all sick of it. So what I've got here is a summary of how you as a patient can get access to medicinal cannabis in other jurisdictions around the world. Because there are so few steps in this, I actually had room to put in the flags, the national flags as well. Okay, Lucy, can you explain in 30 seconds what we have to do in Australia? It took me a while to get that open. I need someone maybe to hold - the bottom of it. - Sure. So these are the steps required in Australia for a patient and a GP to collaborate to access medicinal cannabis Probably 40 new inquiries a day, about 1000 a month. We were at that point in time, getting hundreds of inquiries a day. Everyone's phones ringing with these desperately confused patients. Clearly patients need to be able to afford the medicine that they're being prescribed. There's already a significant cost barrier for people approaching us. They actually say that medicinal cannabis has to be last line therapy. The whole system contradicts itself in terms of who's getting access. We provide it for free, we've never turned anyone away. My patient with cancer has to be on the opiates. And only when that fails, why not medicinal cannabis being first-line? When legal doesn't mean available, - then illegal means nothing. - Absolutely. 2018 is gonna be a scrappy year. There's been a lot of voyeurism, people standing on the edges waiting to get involved when it's convenient. That's probably why we're at where we're at, which is nowhere. The room where my mentor died was where that end light is still on there. He had cancer, but he taught a lot of us how to live. The promise that I actively made to him was that I will always give part of my life in loving service to other beings around me and you know so help me if I don't. And he said, "No worries. I'm absolutely gonna hold you to that." I wanna read out some of the texts that I got in the last few days. Some of the emails that I got in the last few days and just try and help people, to see what it would be like to receive this every day of your life. One after the other, after the other, after the other. You know, I've been told, we shouldn't this an emotional issue, we should be very reasonable about it and always be diplomatic. Well fuck, really? What have we got, buddy? We've got cherry tomatoes, capers, onions, chili, garlic, olive oil, lemon zest And that is going to be mixed with some smoked trout and some fresh parsley and a little tickle. I mean, there's a reason why we've been going this long. It's not because of me, it's because of Luke. I do get pretty hectic, don't I at times? Yeah, he does get hectic but I mean, what we do is pretty stressful too. You know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of stress involved, you know? Basically what we've done is we've taken on a responsibility now, a responsibility of care, - of a duty of care. - A duty of care. - A Real duty of care. - And it's, you know, it's probably in the tens of thousands of people. So I suppose that's pretty incriminating that comment, - but it's true. - Well that's between us and the organizations that we directly relate with. Yeah, it's not just us, but you know, it's you know, it's yeah. There's a large network now. With you all cautious, what are some frustrations for you with Nick? There's an element of caution that I sometimes have felt Nick wasn't fully aware of, what I would call carelessness, but he's really just an enthusiasm to normalize this into something that's good and okay. The way that I communicate with patients is all, I'm pretty open about it at all. That's amazing. - Yeah... - Restaurant quality? Oh yeah. Lukie, what do you think is gonna happen? What do you thinks gonna happen when we finished making this film? It's gonna go to cinema, it's gonna go to TV, people are gonna watch it. Local police stations are gonna see it. What's gonna happen? Well thanks for bringing up the terrifying potential of this film, mate. Should we paint our cars like camouflage so they can't see us when we drive around? I questioned the wisdom of doing this film when we may be on the cusp of, I mean, it's kinda like doing a story on how bad East Germany is a month before the Berlin Wall fell. Like in myself, I'm sitting here thinking, all right, why the fuck are we doing this again? Okay, all right. Why it is is because if people could access this stuff in a safe, legal and preferably affordable manner, they really gonna come and hunt us down on the other side of the country? Rubbish, they gonna go to their doctor, they're gonna get a script, they're gonna go and get the stuff. Like for me, I'm not attacking the police or the politicians. I know I think the real problem lies in far larger business interests that set the game here and set the rules and that the players in it, we can easily blame them. Ah, it's the cops or it's this or it's that. I think that's rubbish. I think that they're as much a, a symptom of a problem as we are a symptom of a problem as well. Look man, I was just born and bred in nature and when I come to a big city like this, I just don't know how people do it. I reckon that they probably think the same about where I live and we all just get used to whatever we're given, but look at it, there's like 20, 30 stories of people just stacked up on top of each other. And we're just getting green, we're getting green lights all the way through here. I think the universe is telling us that we're onto something with a name for this documentary, "Green Light". It's fucking pissing down. If there's anything that's too incriminating, I've got a really tight time. I'm just really stoked that you've allowed me to come and have a chat with you. Are they fucking recording already, bro? - That's all right, okay. - Yeah. My physical medical condition, it's a degenerative bone condition, genetic. So I was born supposedly with you know, - multiple fractures, yeah. - Multiple fractures - from the birthing process? - Yeah. All right and do you remember from when you're really young? Yeah, yeah, just always breaking bones. You know on my chair the other day, just like tipped over out of nowhere and I knocked my head and in that split second, I was like, okay, am I gonna be able to walk again? Am I gonna you know, have to go to get an ambulance? - Did anything break? - Nah, like a couple of ribs, but no breaks, just fractures. Like it happens all the time. There's like lots of reasons why people look at me. Well, there's only one reason it's cause I'm different. They'll take a second glance and can be a bit preserving at times. - That's all. - Sure. So I get a little bit of social anxiety, if you will and I've, yeah. I've been diagnosed with PTSD and all that sort of charge as well. - Wow. - Yeah. Basically I keep a packet of Endone which is oxycodone around. Lyrica and Endone and Temazepam. They're effective in what they target and what they treat, but you pay a toll for them. - You know? - Okay. So I always feel like I've just got cotton wool wrapped around my brain. I've given you some CBD oil. I hope that you will be able to put aside other things to a large degree and only use them when absolutely necessary. Yeah, that's my hope too, man. Don't let yourself get pushed around. Yeah, no, you woke up my wife. She's pretty upset. - Anyway, sorry about that. - No, I'm sorry about that. So you've got three, you've got three tubes there, right? - You've got three syringes? - Yup. The large one is the CBD. - Yup. - Okay, which is the non-psychoactive cannabis oil. The CBD, I'd suggest that you take that two times a day. That's what I needed tonight last night. - Yup, yup. - Day and night, what to do. Okay, you can also vaporize that. So if you want vaporizer, I can send it up to you. That's what I'm saying. This is a trial only based on and they're the best in our community. - Okay, great. - But they saved my life, - I shouldn't be here. - Okay. Technically, I should've been gone seven years ago. Hey mate, I've actually gotta go. I've got two other appointments that are booked and I've gotta talk to right now. - Yup. - Just... Spend a couple of days on it, see how you feel, and give me a call back in a couple of days and just give me a bit of a rundown on how they're working for you. Please don't give up. And also unless anybody or anything goes wrong, your wife's got the phone number, please ring me because I will ring everybody. And they know even if need be to get you out, so I can break my fucking um, what do you call when you get old? My pension to try to get you out. Oh, that's very sweet, mate. Thanks, I hope it never gets to that. No, but I'm just saying if some fucking low life decides to be a shit in your area, we're there for you, - if you know what I mean? - Thanks mate. Yep, thank you very much. - Bye. - Okay, bye mate. I mean I feel for him. You know, he got run over by a postal truck. You know, he was a champion sailor, active member of his community and he, he got run down. So he's a paraplegic but still has all the nerve endings and still feels all the pain. Definitely a lot better for you than taking opiates. Right, I've gotta make another call. Would you mind if we just keep rolling? Yeah, no, go for it. Man, it's like this, hey... Hey, it's like this everyday, mate. All right, give us a call back, thanks man. - Is this good? - Which way do you wanna go though, should we take her up through the mountains? Yeah, the back way or? Well there'll be definitely no cops if we go the back way. Yeah, my air con kind of works and then it doesn't work. So just give it a minute, it should kick in again. Fucking hell. I think our families are really concerned. I know they are, both our partners are concerned. I mean you know, they both love us, they both believe in what we're doing but at the same time, you know, we've both got young children. You know, I've got three beautiful daughters and they all need me. And a baby on the way and you know there's no way that my partner wants to raise a baby whilst I'm incarcerated. I mean that thought's fucked. Look at that, mate, I told you we'd make it here if you just go that way. I've got a lot going on in my head, mate. - Huh? - I've got a lot going on in my head. I've got fucking four different conversations going on at once. I've got fucking three sick people trying to get hold of me, I'm trying to organize this, pull off a fucking interview. Well, I get you are. Just put them aside, I've got fucking all those people as well. All the dying, I get it, but you gotta put 'em aside. - Are we gonna have oil? - No. - Are you gonna take it? - No. Okay, turn around. - Yum. - Good job. You love your oil, don't you? More. You want more? Can I give you the last little bit? - Good job. - Awe, mate. Thank you. - All done, thank you, Hunter. - A pretty good effort, mate. Hi, Danielle, your friend posted an article on your son on my CBD page on Facebook and brought your son's story to my attention. I supply people with CBD and THC oils and if this is something that you've considered, I'd be happy to help you. I suggest you speak to your doctors first and see what they say. Please be reassured that we have the best quality organic oils. Thanks, Nicholas. And then your response was, "Nicholas, thank you for your message. We're seven months into my son's treatment and his tumors are getting worse and are now desperately looking for other options to combat this, so I'm definitely interested in this. We have an appointment next week with Hunter's oncologist and we'll find out what they suggest. Thank you so much." I put my hope into the oil but, you know, what else can you do? Your child's on chemo and it literally was our last resort. So if it didn't work, it didn't work. What happened with the tumors growth? We had a terrible result in his MRI, has tumors were growing at an exponential rate. His oil was started, his next MRI, his tumor had shrunk. And the MRI a month later, his tumors were almost almost gone. You wouldn't say he was even going through chemo because he was just that normal. After the chemo cycle, we kept him on the oil, our oncologist said, "Keep him on for a year, take him off, see what happens." We weaned him off the oils and he had his next MRI and tumors had started growing back. So we put him straight back onto the oil. Three weeks later, he had another MRI and his MRI was clear. You can't tell me that the oil hasn't done that. What was the worst case scenario? Hunters eyes would have been removed, - both of them. - Right. I mean, we had a checkup with his oncologists a few weeks ago. He said, "If somebody had given him a bet for a million dollars to say Hunter would be where he is today, he wouldn't have taken that." Are you planning on continuing taking the cannabis oils? If we have to sell houses and cars and we'll do that. Let's let them not get to that. Yeah, let's not. You just need a bigger garden and we can show you how to make your own. It takes courage to break the law and to give your child, you're very, very young child - an illicit substance. - Yeah. I mean, you took a punt on me. And I'm glad I did. Yeah, well I mean you could have also just reported me straight to the police as well saying, there's this guy stalking me on Facebook trying to sell me pot 'cause you know, I did feel a bit weird about that, but at the same time when I read that story, you know like I said, I've got kids, and I can only just put myself in your position and think, my God, how would I feel? - That me. - That is you. That's when you were sick, isn't it? Ah, there's one of you. You're not sick anymore, are you? - No. - Your eyes are good now, - aren't they? - Yes. Okay, cool, all right. You have a good day. Thanks Mark, bye. I was so drained yesterday, mate. I was so cooked after, like the four consultations that I did yesterday were just... I mean, two of them are just fucking heart breaking. Bit that I find tough is that quite a lot of the people that I speak to are actually, there's a good chance that they're gonna die. And I think you need to be really careful what you say and how you say it to a dying person and their family - Good girl. - Good girl. Looks like it's black, but it's actually really green. All right, Allymae, did I give you that little band-aid? Yeah. I'm gonna put this on your nose. She might go back a little bit, but she should be okay. Good girl. Let's give her a little bit of that CBD. I think you should give that to her - Okay. - And just put it on your finger, put it in on her gums. Good girl, good girl. Here you go, it's a good dose. And I'll get you a smaller tube of this and we'll just start giving it to her daily. I think it'd be really good for her. Good girl, Manuka, come on. So what we did then is we applied the THC oil directly onto the tumor. The CBD, we gave it probably twice as much as what you'd give a human for a dose. But I mean, if you look at the size of a horse compared to the size of human, that makes perfect sense. The CBD is gonna work exactly the same way as it works in humans. It would be good if you can keep a diary of it so we can and keep photographing it - so that we can... - Yeah, yeah. We can show the people if it works or not. - I'm pretty sure it will. - Yeah, I've been taking photos every day. Yeah, good. And you can actually see a reduction in the size of the lump itself. - Already in five days? - Yeah. Just it's not a massive difference, - but yeah, just yeah. - It's shrinking. - A small amount, yeah. - Yeah, cool. Not gonna buck me off, are you? If he going us? I don't know. They did clock the camera before I saw the guy at all. - They did what? - Clock the camera. So they might just be... I'm not sure what that is, yeah. What are we filming guys? A nature documentary. We can turn off early if you'd like. I'm just wondering where that cop is and if he's still behind us and don't believe he is, I think he's pulled off. He's gone? Yeah. No, I think he's gone. I would just... Whenever I see police when I'm driving, I get like a, almost like a slight hypoventilation and I feel, I think, oh have I got any medicine in the car? I just notice right then when a police car drove past, I had a card that had medical cannabis advisory written on it and if you get pulled up and that's visually seen, then there's due cause to search the car. I try and always remember the police are very human, we're all humans. Everything's you know, that they're not out on a witch hunt particularly for me, but it's hard to tell my subconscious that. Are your hand's shaking a bit? They are shaking. They were yes, my hands were shaking and now I'm getting everything under control again. It's like he's got a bloody rubber band around the bowel. He can't physically eat anymore without vomiting. We have to wait two an a half months so he can actually see a specialist. It had turned to the size of a fucking mandarin. There's a tumor the size of a mandarin grown in a month? Yes. Wow, I'm gonna make sure that you get some CBD to help him stay calm and do some other things. The THC is vaporizing or smoking. So lung induced, then there's oral administration and then there's actually rectal administration. You're going to get the best outcome possible if he can take it as a suppository and orally as well. Sugar, process meats, alcohol, tobacco need to, they need to see the back of those ASAP. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you. - All right, see you later. - I appreciate your help. - My pleasure. - Bye. Hearing things like bacon and coffee for breakfast and cigarettes and all that kind of stuff. I need to be as encouraging as I can with people to really clean it up. I starting using cocaine really heavily you know, like a gram a day, that was just everyday and that particular drug has the capacity to hollow you right out. You know I think it an enormous amount of motivation and dedication to be a full scale drug addict on the level that I was. We'd often party all night, bottle of tequila, 10 pills, snort, whatever, have an hour sleep or none at all and then get into work, and cook 50 different menu items in an open kitchen blazed out of our minds. I just didn't stop. I'd be in the bathroom having lines, I'd be under the bench having lines, I'd be at home having lines. I'd wake up in the middle of the night and have lines and go back to sleep. Was a wrecking ball for my relationship. She worked with me and ran the restaurant. Cocaine helped us to really toxify our relationship to the point it was just horrendous and now I think the only way we put up with each other was by snorting the day away. The idea of suicide crept in somehow. I realized that I simply was never really afraid of death. Death wasn't an issue for me, fucking life was. I scoured a liter of tequila and I ate three grams of cocaine and then I ate about 80 Valiums. So I laid back and just fell back into a void and then I woke up with my dad shaking me and looking me in the face and tears running down his face and saying, you know, he's like he just looked at me and he said, don't fucking go there. Having been a pretty broken person and then learning how to fix myself with the care and support of others, it was my duty to go and give that to other people. We've got these 10 foot high, this vine and this is the base of it, the base of it here and that's on my sons placenta and I'm so stoked to see that, that's so cool. A lot of people plant a tree on their child's placenta. This vine's known as the vine of the souls. So in helping to saving my soul, planning this vine on my sons placenta here in a place of healing and magic for peoples of this land, the indigenous peoples, there's a lot of symbolism in that for me and this tree here has survived against all the odds and that's how I see the human spirit and I would like those attributes for my son. To have a great deal of strength of character and survival instinct and to be tall and strong in this life. Hi, Angela, how are you doing today? Hi, I'm not too good today. I'm a bit down in the dumps. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you already started undergoing chemotherapy or radiation? This is my third week. - Right. - And then, sorry. Okay, yeah I'm listening, go on. And then I'm on vitamins one and two. Okay. Then I'd like to introduce a combination of THC and CBD. Thank you very much for that. You're welcome, darling. All right, well, we'll speak soon and I'll email you tonight. You just send me your email. All right. Ted, you going? Yeah, good man. So the CBD, you take it two to three times a day like a large rice grain under the tongue? Yeah, I've only, I can only do it morning and night 'cause I can't take it to work because I don't have you know a fridge at work or anything, so. Yeah, I have a feeling it's gonna help you, mate. Yes. Have a great day, lots of love and we'll speak soon. I experimented with the harder drugs at an early age. You know, LSD and a bit of speed here and there in the late 80s. I started using heroin when I was my mid 20s. Was pretty lucky to survive that. I spent I'd say maybe three or four years off and on using that stuff. I had a couple of really close calls. I OD'd three times. I was clinically dead twice. And ambition sort of pulled me out of that. And when I moved to the States, I sort of gave it all away and left that sort of part of my life behind me. But I'm sort of glad that I went through that now because it's given me a really good understanding on addiction and how people cope with giving up opiates. This is my other mum. We're gonna talk about why you needed to see me. Lucky I've got you for son. The problem I have is here. Just sort of tells the story of what my poor little backbone looks like. So you can see there's some pretty serious stuff going on with her spine. They recommended oxycodone, Endone and Targin, which was quite a cocktail, made me pretty ill. I think the worst part of it was that it put my plumbing to sleep. It was humiliating to say the least. I've always been a pretty forthright, pretty strong sort of a person. So I was never used to having people do things for me. After 12 months on those drugs, I was advised that if I just stopped taking it, it would be a little bit difficult. That was a big understatement. It was horrendous. It took me 10 days, I was in cold sweats, I was saturating my bed every night, I had hallucinations. But right now, I might not even take that THC because my pain gets bad if I'm moving, if I'm bending, Which you do a lot, you're very active. Yeah, you were on the phone to me everyday, seeing if it was working for me and it was working, - I was up on my feet... - How long did that take? Do you remember? Like from the time that you took it to the pain stopping. The pain stopped within about 15 minutes. So I don't have to employ somebody to push me around in the wheelchair and be embarrassed and humiliated anymore - and I'm not in pain. - Yeah. And if you don't know how the hell you're gonna stop the pain you're in, that is pretty scary. What about losing your supply? - How does that make you feel? - That is even scarier and one of the reasons why I don't want to be filmed, I don't want my name mentioned, I don't want anybody to know where I live or who I am. If it makes you feel any better, I've buried a bunch of it in the garden for you. So if I do get taken away, I'll just send you a letter and tell you where it's buried. I feel tragically sorry for people who can't access it or who've been indoctrinated into thinking there's something wrong with it. And I was skeptical, but I was in pain. So thank you for giving me the last year of my life back. - My pleasure. - 'Cause it's pretty precious. World needs people like mum definitely. So what I tend to do is once I get my supply, is put it in a syringe for safekeeping with a stopper on it and then I've just put a drawing up which is a blunt needle, so it's not a sharp, it's not gonna hurt you and we're going to give on your finger. We're gonna give a couple of drops. You can do that finger, are you? Yeah and then that'll just come out drop by drop so I can monitor how much he's getting. - Ohh. - Whoops. There you go, four drops. That's a lot, yeah. And he's gonna rub that under, in the sides of his mouth and he'll hate the taste. He'll screw that up. - It's not great, is it? - No. It's one of the less pleasant things. Their diagnosis was stage four. - Yeah, okay. - Yeah. When Sandy asked, so what are we talking, years? And she said, no, months, and I've sort of gone, shit. It was like a big kick in the guts. So we took three days just to digest it. And then it was, for me, it was full on let's research the fuck out of this. I need to know, you know? And I didn't care whether it was conventional or not. You wondered what would work, - what would save him? - I wanted to know, - yeah, yeah. - So we just threw everything at it. Did a lot of research on dosing and it's said to start with one drop for four days - and then go to two drops... - Start low, go slow. Yeah, the start low, go slow. And I said, "Sorry, fuck the go slow process. You going to a mil and a half today." We just went, boom. And what had happened when you got those scans? Left side around into here had gone from 18 or 20 tumors down to less than five. Okay, significantly. How did that feel being a nurse? I have asked every oncologist that we've been to and I've asked GPS, can we get a script, can we get a script? No, sorry, I don't feel comfortable doing that. It's legal for chemotherapy side effects, you know? -So for nausea, vomiting, -That's right. But it's not for treatment. I did actually say to the radiation oncologist can I have a script? And she said, "No, no well you don't fit in the category, you haven't got cancer anymore." Now that you technically do have cancer again, sorry to bring it up again, but what's, what would be the outlook then? It's still the same, they don't do it. Because you're not undergoing chemo. He wouldn't be going undergoing chemo. And we dropped down to maintenance dosing, which was really quite minimal 'cause again, you know, finances really... This is a big issue, - isn't it? - Yeah, - it's expensive. - It's expensive on that note, I also wanted to donate a bunch of oils to you guys so that you can take on a, you know a bit more of a full scale approach. I understand how difficult it gets for people to service this kind of thing, so. I don't feel like, I'm absolutely wanting and welcoming and appealing for assistance, of better trained professionals to step in and be able to help these people. And at the moment, I feel like we're a bit of a one-stop shop for this issue and this issue shouldn't be a one-stop shop. You need counselors, you need prescribers, you need people then that dispense it, you need people that grow it, you need people in manufacture it. You need so many different people that I'm not, and I don't know if anyone's truly equipped to deal with speaking to endless cases of people that can't get what they need and have those really difficult decisions to face. I just, you know, part of me is a voice in my, an inner voice that says, one you're doing really wonderful work and another voice that says, well, I mean, I'm not the guy for the job. I'm just giving in 'cause fucking hell. Hey darling, how you doing? Still just in pain 'cause I don't have anything to sort of help me get through the day. I'm gonna make sure that you get some things, that's okay. I hate hearing you like this. We'll get things done in the morning. I'm sorry, I don't meant to like bother you on a weekend and stuff, but I'm just like really, really struggling. Are any of the pharmaceutical meds doing anything to help? You know, what are you taking - of those at the moment? - Like Endone a little bit but I can't just keep taking opioids. So that's why like I'm considering hysterectomy because nothing else is helping. Do you feel like the oils have had had any significant benefit to you? - Like, even in the short-term? - Oh huge. Helps with my anxiety, helps with my heart racing, helps me sleep. As far as a hysterectomy goes, I mean you're aware of what that means for your - around? - Well it means we can't have kids and I'm 23. It means you can't, yeah. I mean that's a huge choice for a 23 year old to make. I mean just for me to feel that you're saying that, if that and that means you can't have kids, I mean, that brings up a lot for me, let alone what it must bring up for you. Yeah. Look, I need to get to a point where you just don't know what else to do. Yeah. So I don't have the words really to actually express how that decision that you're looking at makes me feel and... And I hope you find strength wherever you can. - Talk to you soon, bye. - All right, we'll talk tomorrow. - See you, Luke. - Okay. All right. Anyway, anyway. Can we cut for a tick? Can we just, just for a tick, is that all right? I just, just... With Aikido, you can do it physically, just basically as a technique or you can unify mind and body and use that person's power and energy. For that, you've gotta be centered yourself. You don't need physical strength. You can do all kinds of things that don't require physical strength. So there's a whole bunch of tests that we do. We use an arrow, so here. So this is very daunting and we're gonna break this arrow. So from there, unify mind and body, you relax, you move forward. Looks easy, it is. But if you don't get taught how to move properly and use your energy properly, this can be a bit tricky. So don't try it at home. I had a red spot on my forehead which I couldn't get rid of. So I went to my GP, he did a biopsy, and it came back as skin cancer. If you cut into cancers, quite often it seeds into your blood supply and it did, it went into my left nymph node and they want to cut me open from here to here, across here, down here and across here, pull all the skin back and you'll be deformed. I said, "Okay, I don't wanna do that. I want to try other things." And that little one grew to a monster. Thought that's strange, so I went into the bathroom, peeled the bandage off and I was bleeding out from a carotid artery. So it was raised to an emergency. They put a torch into the hole, they said, "We can actually see the carotid artery. It's completely diseased, we can't even operate." Said, "How long have I got?" they said, "Minutes to hours." Any blood pressure increase or a laugh or a cough or a movement or the way that it's going, it's gonna burst out you're just going to bleed out. I had, at that stage, been examined by nine oncologists and all said the same thing. You know, you're not gonna survive this, you're gonna die. But I survived that night. Obviously I couldn't do Aikido, I could hardly move properly. But I practiced some of the breathing and mind, the meditation techniques. My last resort was to look at medicinal cannabis. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die. So you know, I wasn't too concerned personally about the legality status of it. The doctor came out and said, "Yeah, well, there it looks a lot better than the last time I saw it, but there's a huge hole, Michael. That's going to take three months to close up." But in one month, that hole closed up. Using CBD and THC which was miraculous to the nurses and to the doctor, they weren't expecting that. So my GP saw the pictures and he said, "I bumped into your oncologist and showed him the pictures. The oncologist never said a word. He just looked at it, shut up and walked away." That's unfortunate because it's about saving human life. And in suffering, open your mindset up to what else is out there. Luke saw the wound and saw the reduction, you know, he was very excited because it helps people and helped me. People wanted to know how I was fixed. So I told them about it. Luke said, "Do you want to be an advocate?" I said, "Yeah, I want people to get better." Now I know about helping people and dosing it correctly. So it gave me purpose. Hey come on in. - Good to see you. - You too, man. I do have the odd moment of real concern that the stress of what you're doing may translate into a resurgence of your, of your condition. In this hand I hold the beautiful things that this has brought to my life, that I'll never forget and will always do in some way, shape or form, whether in the service or another. And in the hand to hold the reality of the impact that it's had on my health. And my concern for you is that I wonder if you're putting aside your life in order to keep doing this for others. And I just want you to know, I love what you're doing. - Thank you. - And I also love you enough that if you said to me, I feel like I need to stop this for my own wellbeing, that I would support you in that as all the people supported me. I took 2000 patients names out of my phone that had direct access to me and I gave them to all of these people. And now the patients are getting better care. It got to a critical mass, you know, recently. And then I think I don't have a life. There's people for some reason, planning badly, running out of product on the weekend, urgently need it and you don't get any time off, at night or during the day and things like that. And you're dealing with people, you've gotta give them attention and your energy. And by the end of the day, you're a bit weary. And then you get calls and you get texts and you need to respond. So you feel yourself forcing to respond. And I know that if I look at my phone now, there'll be six to 10 texts, you know? And that's gotta change, you know, 'cause I'm not 100% yet. I had no future, I was depressed and anxious and I didn't know how I was gonna look after myself. You helped me and supported me through all that. Really is true and wonderful. - Thank you. - I'm very touched that you'd say that. How you doing? Congratulations. Leave my fucking hair alone, mate. Come here. How's the baby? - Baby's good, baby's good. - Yeah? Is he like, come back into shape? - Yeah. - Dude was he squashed? His head looked like a little alien. - Full on, isn't it? - Yeah. Yeah. - You had some sleep? - Yeah. Straight up and turn right. I lost two patients last week. - Really? - Left here. They were, you know, still lucid and still comfortable and one in particular managed to eat three meals a day for his last week and he hadn't eaten - for months before then. - Wow. So just for the fact that he was able to enjoy, you know some meals - before he died. - Awesome, last meals. It's huge, isn't it? - Hello. - Hey Allymae. Hello Manuka. - Look at that. - Yeah. - Just a little lump. - It's slightly there but... I'd still kept putting it on. - Is it that good? - From that massive lump that it was sticking right out from her nose. The treatment time was about six to eight weeks, - wasn't it? - Yeah. See to me, it doesn't feel like there's any, it's like if I go like that, right? - Yeah, yup. - That's the size of maybe half a pea in there. And so it would be interesting to just keep putting some on there - Yeah, okay. - And see if that just disappear completely, hey? Lately, I'm so impressed with what's happened, hey. - Good girl. - Beautiful girl. - Hey Luke. - How are you? We got some photos. I want to have a look at them with you -of last time -Okay, yeah. When we first started and let's have a look at them together and see if we're imagining things. Well here especially, that's all gone down. Yeah, that whole, the whole front part of it. And now it's actually flattened off. There's been a significant reduction, at least on the front half of the tumor and that whole part there that's protruding, that's all gone. There's no pressure or anything, but if we can wrap this up in 15 minutes, everyone will be happy. -There, see, no pressure, -Yeah, no pressure - whatsoever. - Don't be anxious. It's been a couple of months since we saw you last. We implemented a regimen of using oils. What's happened for you? Ah mate, what hasn't happened? Since starting on the oils, I've stopped taking the vast majority of my medication. I'm not smoking anymore. You look a lot clearer in your face. Yeah, yeah. You know, I mean between the oils and my girlfriend, yeah. Like things are really good, man. If we go to the doctor, there might be some other reason why he is. Absolutely, you know, I think we need to get blood tests. I think we need to explore all the options, put them together and find a way forward. How do you feel about that? Yeah, I'm all for it. You all for it? I really appreciate what you're doing. - Thanks. - Yeah. - All right, cheers. - Thank you very much. It's been roughly two months since we first started him off and I'm really happy he's decided to accept outside professional help. The kind of which I can't give. I'm so happy about that. Come on mate, come on bro. Bring it in. Thanks for everything, man. I had to go through nine sessions of chemotherapy. During that, I took the medicinal cannabis, which took away a lot of the nausea, gave me my appetite, helped me sleep. Going in for a little paddle? Austin didn't even know I surfed. I haven't surfed for a while. Well, I already knew what I was up for 'cause I went through testicular cancer when I was 22 and I knew I needed something else to help me through this stage. Yeah, amazing to say the least. Your dealer is your healer. That's right. I'm in remission now. At the same time, I'm not listening to doctors with their, you know, you're in remission, just go on about your life. Still on the medicinal cannabis, slowly taking my way off that. Being diagnosed with cancer, if it doesn't kill you, it'll completely change your life. I feel like if anything, I've become super human. I feel like a criminal if I stopped. If I was to turn my phone off tomorrow, so many people would be in a real spot. You know this work that we do needs to be continued. And if we can't continue it, then please provide us with people that can. I really hope what I'm doing and the things I'm talking about are taken in the spirit that they're meant. What we're trying to do is a positive, good thing and is helping and please don't lock me up or anyone that I know. I rejected life at one place, I didn't wanna be in it and every single day, I get this massive rush of gratitude at some point that I'm alive and this is my reminder today. - Hey, Nicholas. - Yeah, hi there. We've been playing phone tag all day. How's your partner doing? Yeah, look you know is just that arthritis. Sounds fucking horrible. So your body's full of inflamation, yeah? He said the doctor said that he wasn't terminal. No one survived. All right, take care.
