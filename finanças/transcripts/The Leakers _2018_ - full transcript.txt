What's wrong, Ming? Ming! An unknown and high-risk infectious disease has broken out in Malaysia. The death toll today has risen to 60. A panel of experts from The World Health Organization is already here. Life in Malaysia has been greatly affected in the past 2 weeks. As well as rushing to buy groceries, drinking water, masks, and disinfectants, people have to avoid crowded places. All kindergarten and primary school classes have been suspended. High schools, universities, and other organizations must close immediately if any cases are suspected. A designated General Hospital in the suburbs is the centre for admissions and quarantine. Medical personnel have revealed that antibiotics are no use for the unknown disease. At this exceptional time, some doctors have suggested that... any patient who is willing to try it can take a new drug called MD5 before the Drug Control Authority's approval process is complete. Because there's no other way to control the disease and reduce the death rate. Danny Song, New China News. Apart from a pen, a camera, and a computer, more importantly, an outstanding journalist must be very brave and act on his conscience. This year, the Most Outstanding Journalist Award goes to... Actually it nearly goes without saying, because she has already won it twice in a row. She reported on government executive corruption, which caused a stir, as well as the bone-chilling organ trafficking case. Last year, she also reported a bank's scheme for transnational money laundering. May we have... the winner of the Most Outstanding Journalist Award up here. Miss Carly Yuen, please! Hello, everyone! Clearly I'm not Carly Yuen. I'm a news cameraman, she and I are partners, Carly wants me to thank all of you. She can't make it here today, sorry! She's following a very important story. On the recent epidemic threat in Malaysia, infectious disease specialists using gene-mapping techniques on the virus, have determined that this variant of ZIKB is VR-23 In the early stages of the disease, patients will show symptoms of mild fever, rash and headache. Within two days, symptoms progress rapidly with high fever, extreme muscle cramps and a dramatic weakening of the body's vital systems. The exact latency of the virus is still uncertain, but it appears that the duration between initial infection and death, is no more than two weeks with the mortality rate of 70%. We have classified the threat level here as 5, which means the outbreak has pandemic potential with extremely short response times. Ah...woman in the beige coat. I'm Carly Yuen from Hong Kong Daily. Mr. Smith. Have you found the source of epidemic? And how do the citizens prevent themselves from getting the infection? The original strain of ZIKB is spread by infected mosquitoes. But the VR-23 variant can also be spread via "person to person" contact. Moreover, there's currently no vaccine for the treatment of VR-23. Ah...grey suit and glasses. Danny Song from NCN. There are rumors saying that there are Malaysian medical practitioners using a new medicine called "MD5" before the DCA approval process completed. Are you aware of this issue? Will that medicine have any effect? Well, as they say "Desperate times require desperate measures" The WHO has been looking into the use of MD5. And from our initial observations it does seem to treat the disease and the Malaysian government has been explicit in their desire to see pharmaceutical companies expedite both the production and distribution of MD5 with priority given to Malaysian patients. Carly! Hi! Long time no see. You kept saying "No!" to my invitation to Malaysia I can't believe I've lost to this variant virus. Why didn't you call me? I wasn't sure about your girlfriend. I don't have one. How about dinner tonight? I'm in a hurry to go back. Why don't you come to Hong Kong for dinner? Okay, I remember your birthday is coming next month. We can celebrate it together. Only if I am free. Your birthday present is "X-Files", the Blu-ray version. Do you still remember that? "The truth is out there" Don't say "No!" to me this time. I will visit you in Hong Kong. I won't say "No!" as long as it doesn't go against my professional ethics. You surely haven't changed a bit. Hello? Yes! Hey! You! We got an intruder on the 23rd floor. Stop! Intruder fled to the 22nd floor, reinforcements! Freeze! Freeze! We are chasing the intruder up the stairs in zone B! Freeze! Wait a second, Miss! Let me take the child's temperature. Excuse me, Miss! I need to take your temperature. Sorry, your temperature is a little high, go over there for a check-up, please! - Danny! - Morning! - Morning! - Morning! - Morning! - Morning! - Morning! - Morning! Hey, Danny! Your mail. Thank you! It looks like as if we've booked this whole restaurant. An epidemic is raging out there. Who dares to eat out? Only you and I have got the guts. That's the power of love. Mom wants two more tables for her guests. She says an aunt from the United States wants to come to our wedding, too. It's okay with me. Actually, I've rarely met my relatives. Um! Don't put too much pressure on yourself. People say you only play with this fidget spinner when you're stressed. In fact, things are going pretty well with our wedding. Relax! I just want to keep my fingers busy. But I can't help thinking when everything's going so well, something's gonna go wrong. Don't meet trouble halfway. Help me to pick 10 of these wedding pictures, I'll enlarge them. Sorry! Hello? Okay, I'll be right there. Sorry, I have to go to work. Okay, my treat. Okay! Send me those wedding photos. And the receipt. - Duan! - What happened? Looks like somebody jumped to his death. The body is over there. The deceased lived in #608 Wasn't he that TV journalist? No wonder he looks so familiar. - Duan! - Duan! Duan! "Life is killing me, goodbye" Is this a suicide note? I've seen so many of them, but rarely typed on a computer though. Maybe he wanted to make sure someone would see it. Why didn't he simply write it down and put it on the desk top instead. Excuse me, I need the fingerprints on that keyboard. - Yes, sir! - Thank you. I don't know anything. "VR 23 is raging. People are panicking in Malaysia." Obviously, this is a suicide case. There's a suicide note, and credit card debts. We checked his income, he could pay off his debt any time. Look at his suicide note, it's written on his computer... I know you suspect the note is fake, but according to the forensic report, the fingerprints on the keyboard belong to the victim. I smell something fishy. I'll look into it further. Okay, you may. But remember... Most importantly, you know when to stop. Um? What was Danny Song working on before his death? He just said he had been following something real big, but didn't go into any details. Well, had he embarrassed anyone in any news he reported? Far too many! One way or another, someone gets pissed by each and every thing we report. You've worked with him for so long, how likely do you think he could kill himself? Well, it's not for me to say. I can help you with Danny Song's work for the last two years. Okay, thank you. Danny Song was a good boss. I don't think he killed himself. He asked me to book an air ticket for him yesterday, and said he wanted to visit a woman in Hong Kong, a woman he liked a lot in university. Is this Carly Yuen, please? Speaking, who's this? I'm calling from the Malaysian Police. This is Inspector Lee Weng Kan. Do you know a person by the name Danny Song? We studied Journalism together in university. Do you know he is dead? I just found out. "Danny Song Memorial Page" I'd like to know if he told you any problems at work before his death? We met at the WHO press conference in Malaysia to report on the ZIKA variant virus epidemic. But the whole world was going after that news then. Well, give me a call if you think of anything. I'll send you my number later. I'll do anything for Danny Song's sake. I'd like to know what happened to him, too. Where is Mr. Teo? We're all waiting for him. Go get Chun Loong, quick! Yes! Mr. Teo Mr. Teo? Mr. Teo? Get him down! Make him comfortable before calling the police. Get him down? Do what I told you. But the police... He's my son! You're of my blood! Take the secret access! Yeah, Duan! Mr. Teo! How does your son's death affect Amanah's business, Mr. Teo? Mr. Teo! There are rumors that Teo Chun Loong committed suicide. Is it true? Say something, Mr. Teo! Will your second son take over his work? Behind me is the residence of Teo Jit Sin, founder and chairman of Amanah, the second-largest drug company in our country. Teo Jit Sin is a medical practitioner. In 1984, he and his pharmacist wife, Ying Seow Chern, co-founded Amanah. At first, they only took orders from big pharmaceutical companies in the West to make patent medicines until 1996. Malaysia had become the market leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in medicines and was able to sell medicines to countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Africa, and Iran. Opening up these new markets led to the vigorous growth of Malaysia's pharmaceutical business. How did Amanah become so respected in medicine? All because it focused on the research and development of "orphan" medicines. The so-called "orphan" medicines are for rare disorders. But spending large sums of money on small numbers of patients was of little interest for the research work of pharmaceutical companies. However, more and more countries began to care and were willing to sponsor the development of "orphan" medicines. In 2002, Malaysia officially joined the PICS. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme... PICS allowed the medicines to enter the European, Australian, and Canadian markets. In 2007, Amanah became a listed company in the US. Teo Jit Sin and his wife, Ying Seow Chern, went to the same university, married in 1980, and had 2 sons. Their first son, Teo Chun Loong, was found dead in his office today. Teo Chun Loong was the General Manager of Amanah. He served in the Air Force, and was awarded a National Defense Allegiance medal. His wife was the famous women's shoe-designer, Phang Zhen Mei. They had no children. The death of Teo Chun Loong shocked not only his family, but the pharmaceutical industry and the stock market. Teo Jit Sin is the chairman and the largest shareholder of the USD $200M market. After the death of Teo Chun Loong, the second son of the Teo family, Teo Chun Yann, who is currently abroad doing his PhD,. is the only heir There is rumor about the Teo family, stating that Teo Jit Sin's wife, Ying Seow Chern, was kidnapped twenty years ago, and there is still no trace of her to date. Cause of death? Asphyxiation. You can see that there is a ligature mark on his neck, suggesting that it was caused by rope strangulation. How about this scar? Oh, I surmise that that is some sort of burn mark. I've seen some policemen with the devil's own luck having such scars after being grazed by bullets. Are the toxicology and blood reports out? Thanks! No alcohol in the blood? It's not a suicide. It's a murder case. The autopsy report has just come out. The cause of your son's death has been changed from suicide to homicide. Who do you think could've murdered your son, Mr. Teo? Do you think all these misfortunes will affect Amanah's business, Mr. Teo? Mr. Teo? Back off, back off a little bit, everyone, please! Thank you. My son, Chun Loong, he was brilliant and loved me a great deal. He was a nice person. I won't let the murderer get away. I am now offering a reward of USD $10M for the murderer, dead or alive! I must, and I will, bring him to justice. Now, let's welcome the famous analyst, Mr. Joe Watson, to explain the recent volatility in the stock price. Thank you, yes. Amanah stock has indeed been extremely volatile recently. And its wide price fluctuations can really be explained by the new medicine, MD5. But at the same time, of course, we have the tragic recent news of the death of Mr. Teo Chun Loong, the General Manager. As the eldest son, he was really seen by the general public as the natural successor to Mr. Teo Jit Sin. So, the company now really has to convince the market as to its new succession plan. Nevertheless, I personally feel very positive about this stock, and despite the news of the death of the eldest son, I think it has strong positive momentum driven by MD5 and its potential to save countless lives in the years ahead. Police! Is Mrs. Teo in, please? No, she's not. Where is she? Dunno! There are so many reporters out there, how could she sneak out? There's a passage in our underground parking lot connected to the building next door. That's probably how she left. Usually, Madam asks me to pack for her, but not this time. She didn't pack much, but I saw her take her passport. She ran away right after her husband's death. We'll have to run to the airport now! Call Immigration to see if she has left the territory yet. Don't let her leave if she hasn't. Also, check this computer. Danny Song's email address is in here. I think Teo Chun Loong and Phang Zhen Mei had contact with him. Yeah, Duan! Hello? Phang Zhen Mei has gone through Immigration, Duan! Her computer shows she booked tickets for 3 destinations. The airlines said the 3 tickets have all been used to check in. So I don't know where she is. Copy! I'll call you right away if anything happens when I arrive at the airport. According to the records, Phang is boarding American Airlines Flight 678 at Gate 6. Take me there, hurry! Final call for Flight 678 to the United States, passengers please check in as soon as possible. Final call for Flight 678 to the United States, passengers please check in as soon as possible. Phang didn't board that flight to the States. Of the other 2 flights, the one to Hong Kong has taken off. So if she's gone, I believe she's heading for Hong Kong. I lost touch with Chun Yann. I was going to tell him about Chun Loong's death. But I just couldn't locate him. Is it likely that he went somewhere with his friends. Chun Loong is dead, so Chun Yann is the only heir now. I'm very worried. I fear he's the murderer's next target. My life of hard work will be wasted if anything happens to him. So I wish you could send your men to find him in Hong Kong as soon as possible. And bring him back in one piece. Don't worry, Mr. Teo. I'll get in touch with the Hong Kong Police now. Eat your noodles! Why aren't you eating? You bought it! I ate already! I'm just here to keep you company. I want to tell you that I'm not coming home tonight. Aren't you on day-shift today? I never see you at home anyway. The files on my desk are up to my chin, Madam! You can always find an excuse, but I have mine, too. You're either not at home, or come home exhausted or in no mood. We hardly ever talk. Aren't we talking now? What're we doing if not? I want to be on my own! Okay. I'll go take a puff. Take your time. Hey! I mean I don't want to be with you anymore. Didn't I say I'm going out for a puff? Am I not letting you be on your own now? Why don't you... go get a drink someplace with some friends. And get home a little late. Okay? What's up? What's up? Hey, Dai Wai! Go find a doctoral student called Teo Chun Yann at HK Research University. I'll send you his details later. Can't you get somebody else to go? Yes, I can! But I want you to go, understand? That Malaysian student and his teammates never go home. See if they can help you. Thank you. Wow! It's cool! This thing...ouch! So cool! What is it? SAR Oh! What does it mean? Super-sense of augmented reality! Put real objects and virtual objects together. Our class did this together. Including Teo Chun Yann? Um! Which one is real, which one is virtual? This is real, this is virtual. Where is Teo Chun Yann? He's not here! Why? Where can he be? Try the student quarters. Real or virtual? For real, sir! Hello? Teo Chun Yann is nowhere to be found, sir! I searched every building. Sir, Interpol is demanding assistance again. Hang on a second! What? What assistance? It's about a passenger flying into Hong Kong now. Her name is Phang Zhen Mei. The Malaysia Police asked us to detain her at the airport. No! We can't detain anyone without authorization. But they've already sent someone here. And they hope we can assist him in an investigation. Mr. Big has been notified of that. Go to the airport now, Dai Wai! What? The airport, might as well! What do you mean by "might as well"? Do you know where I am now? Can't you get anyone else to go? Yes! But I want you to go. Do you know how long I've been on duty today, man? I could sue you for that! Phang Zhen Mei It's me! Keep walking. Excuse us! Stop the car! I'm Inspector Wong Dai Wai. There's been a traffic accident outside of the airport. Send back-up, please! "Madam" What now? What now? Did you grab Phang Zhen Mei? No! I didn't No need to scream! Mr. Chu wants me to tell you that Malaysia is sending an officer here early tomorrow morning for Phang Zhen Mei's case. You want me to spend the night waiting at the airport to pick him up, right? I won't do it! Fuck! I hired a computer expert. He should be able to decode the anti-copy encryption system on the hard disk. Hello? I...have...work to do tonight, can't go home. You didn't have to call to tell me that. Why didn't you assume I wouldn't come home? But you are at home! Because our daughter didn't want to sleep over at my cousin's. She said she didn't want us to divorce. Then don't, okay? There's no point talking to you. Our daughter will come with me after our divorce. Hey, my dear! I think we need to ask her first. Maybe she wants to stay with me. Where could you steal the time to look after her? I don't understand! You do all the talking. You make all the suggestions. You make all the decisions. You're wasting my time. Good news from the hospital this morning. Ten VR-23-infected patients are - gradually recovering... - Congratulations, ma'am! - After a course - Your child has recovered of MD5 treatment. Thank you, doctor! Thank you. MD5 has proven to be effective. And the DCA will simplify the application process to approve the sale of this wonder drug. At the same time, the government has ordered a 100M Ringgitt worth of MD5 The stock price of Amanah went up 20%... 20 minutes before the stock market opened this morning. All passengers please pay attention, due to the raging "VR-23", all visitors from Malaysia, and those who have travelled to Malaysia... Hello? Yes, I'm in Hong Kong now. Having a VR-23 check. You got infected? Oh, No! No, just a check-up. Nothing to worry about. Did you pick the wedding photos? Time to process them. Do them all! They're all very nice. That means you haven't looked at any. To be honest, I haven't. I'm busy. For things like that, why don't you do it? Excuse us, excuse us! VR-23 continues to spread to neighboring regions. VR-23 was first found in Hong Kong after Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. I'm just a little feverish. I haven't got infected, Benson. I'm ready to leave the Quarantine Centre now. It's better for you to stay there. Hong Kong has already got its first VR-23 case. Okay, wait for me at the hospital with all your gadgets then. Hey, get a couple more masks, they are out of stock. Queen Elizabeth Hospital, please! All passengers please pay attention, due to the raging "VR-23", all visitors from Malaysia, and those who have travelled to Malaysia must undergo a "VR-23" quick test. Our staff will lead you to check-up in a while... Inspector Wong? Lee Weng Kan from Malaysia. Copy! What measures has Hong Kong taken to guard against the VR-23 epidemic, Commissioner? Right now, VR-23 can only be treated with one new medicine, it's called MD5. The Quarantine Centre has already bulk-ordered the new medicine. So I think, we should be able to contain the epidemic within a very short time. But the problem is Amanah is the only company that manufactures this new medicine in the world. So I can't say for sure when it will arrive in Hong Kong. What the people can do is stay indoors as much as possible, or only go to places with few people... Maintain personal hygiene... Who is it? Housekeeping! No, thank you! I said "No!" Where's the hard disk? Where is it? In that bag! Take it out! Anyone who comes to Hong Kong must try cream soda and eat wonton noodles with vinegar. Hold it... No, no! I don't want my noodles turning all red. It's better this way. Do you know why we must eat it with vinegar? Tastes better, I guess. It's the acid-base balance. The wonton noodles are alkaline, whereas vinegar is acidic. This is how you enjoy it! The essence of these noodles is the soup. And the wontons... What have you got about Phang Zhen Mei and Teo Chun Yann? We'll get started as soon as we're done here, okay? I am done. Actually I am not that hungry. Bill, please! I'll get it! No, no, no! It's nothing personal! I'll have to take your Ringgitts to the money exchange, man! C'mon, it's okay. No, no, no! That's the rules of the game. Speaking of rules... My boss wants you to know that you have no legal authority to enforce laws here. Also, you aren't allowed to carry a gun. You haven't got one with you, have you? What do you think? I don't know what to say. The bill, please! Come on, finish it! I'm full. Thank you. Sir Is this him? Yes! This is him. Do you speak Cantonese? Oh, yes! How are you, Mr. Chu? Inspector Lee Weng Kan of the Royal Malaysia Police. Why did you bring him here? I didn't! He followed me. I told him about his legal rights here. Hey! Just look, don't touch! Okay! Hey, hey, hey, don't go in! Ask him to wait downstairs. Alright, alright! Wait downstairs. Hey, you're supposed to wait downstairs. Don't you understand Cantonese? I do, I do... Let me see! Hey, just look, don't touch! It's Phang Zhen Mei's forearm. No kidding, are you sure? That's the most intact remnant we could find here, sir! Look at this! Phang Zhen Mei's ring is the same as this. Okay, okay, okay! Good for you! Go, go, go! What is this, Dai Wai? He says it's likely Phang Zhen Mei's forearm, and the ring in this picture... Sir! According to the hotel records, Phang Zhen Mei booked this room with her Malaysian passport. How many people were registered? From the closed-circuit TV here, this white-haired guy was with her at reception. Yeah, right! He was the one that took her away. Do you recognize...this white-haired man? Oh, does this mean I can assist your investigation now? Hey, just look, but don't touch! So take a look. No! I don't recognize him. Oh, boy! A ticket? Wait, wait! Yeah, right! It could be a bomb. We had better be careful. It should be a USB and a tube-shaped object. That means it's a USB bomb with a fuse. Hey, buddy! Is that a ticket or what? What's that? C'mon! Thank you! The victim would've been him, got it? Have you a computer? Yes! We are...The Leakers! A league to maintain the truth. Our purpose is to tear the masks from hypocrites, to expose sugar-coated evil acts to the world. Recently, a new epidemic, VR-23, took over Southeast Asia. Amanah delivered a new medicine to eliminate it. Some people praise Amanah Pharmaceuticals as a savior from disasters. As a matter of fact, curing diseases... just means making big bucks to many pharmaceutical corporations. They go by many twists and turns to bribe medical practitioners who have the authority to prescribe drugs. Luxurious dinner parties... business inspection tours abroad... have become unspoken rules in the industry. And government officials...are accomplices. The way interest is transferred among them is either instant or delayed. They work hand in hand, in collusion. The government purchases new medicines from Amanah using huge public funds. And so Amanah makes big money out of disasters. The company even lays in supplies to create an "out of stock" illusion, putting citizens in fear. We, The Leakers, tell you all that... Teo Chun Yann, the son of Amanah Pharmaceuticals' Teo Jit Sin, is in our hands. Teo Jit Sin has to pay us USD $100M ransom as a penalty Save me, Dad! The blood sample indicated in the police report is identical with your second son's. This salty 7-Up lemonade is really tasty, available only in Hong Kong. This lemon has to be marinated with salt for years, then mixed with 7-Up. C'mon, have a sip. No, thank you! What's the matter? Are you trying to memorize this manuscript? You watch it again and again. Why is this person wearing a "Bocca della Verita" mask? Why? This mask is called the "Mouth of Truth", got it? Because if one inserts his hand and tells lies, one is bitten to death. How do you know? Because I watched "Roman Holiday" Don't you think something doesn't make any sense here. Usually...kidnappers directly contact the hostage family for the ransom. But it's different this time. They first contacted the police. Contacting the police means telling the whole world, which makes it a lot more difficult for them to get the ransom. Is it not logical to do so? What is not logical? They shifted attention to confuse us. Therefore we must think as simple as we can. Did he get along with his siblings? First of all, he and his big brother, - Teo Chun Loong... - Teo Chun Loong Yes! Did they get along or not? Oh, they did! As far as I know. Then why did he come to Hong Kong by himself? His family is so rich! Well, his family doesn't like him then. His big brother... Oops! His big brother is dead. Yeah! Actually, Teo Chun Loong met someone before he died. A reporter called Danny Song. But Song is dead, too. Both of their deaths were made to look like suicide. It must've been The Leakers That's why I want to know who The Leakers are. They murdered Teo Chun Loong, and fatally bombed Phang Zhen Mei. Now they've kidnapped Teo Chun Yann. If they did all this, they can't just be a bunch of nobodies. Nope! It's because they are all nobodies. You're right, it's just like those starlets in showbiz. They have to make-believe with rumors, scandals, meeting big bosses in discreet places. Then get the paparazzi to take some photos. That's how they make their names known. The kidnappers called the police themselves. Obviously they want to attract attention. They want to make headlines in the international news. If Hong Kong can't handle this, we'll be the laughing stock of the whole world. These Leakers are really...really... "Lui, wife" Hello? What? Which hospital? Mister? Mask! Dai Wai! It's VR-23 Boy! How did she get it? She should be alright. Malaysia has the medicine, so will Hong Kong. How's my daughter, doctor? She's lucky, she got here early enough We gave her a dose of MD5. She's stable now. Can I see her, doctor? Sorry, all VR-23 patients are quarantined. I asked her. To my surprise, she said she wanted to stay with you. To your surprise? Isn't she angry with me? I'm so busy that I seldom spend time with her. That's why she wants to stay and look after you. I know something disastrous is happening out there. Since you can't get anything done here, why don't you go back to work for now? I swear to God, all these years, I never gave in to vicious power, neither did I encourage crime. So I've decided not to pay the ransom. I'm putting my son's life in the hands of the police. Right now, we're using MD5 to treat VR-23 The hospital has placed more orders for it. It should be enough for a while. Hello? Carly Yuen! Speaking. Who's calling? A Leaker. I've got something stunning. Interested? It depends on how stunning it is. It has a lot to do with your friend Danny Song's death. Shall we meet and talk? Hello? Go to the movie theatre, get 2 tickets for House 3 H4, L24 2 for House 3, please! You sit over there. Will get back to you later. Hello? Go to the ladies' room now. Carly? Carly? Carly Carly! Hello? Don't worry, Carly will go home in one piece. Hey, hello? How are you, Miss Yuen? Sorry about meeting this way. Phang Zhen Mei? Your friend Danny Song didn't commit suicide, he was murdered. We both worked together for nearly a year. I know it's hard for you to believe us all of a sudden. But you're a professional, you should want to know whether the news you come across is real or not. The highly-acclaimed reporter Carly Yuen covered the Teo Chun Yann kidnap by The Leakers... who demand a ransom of USD $100M from Teo Chun Yann's father, Teo Jit Sin Teo Jit Sin has refused to pay. "Teo Chun Yann kidnapped" According to Carly Yuen's coverage, "by The Leakers in Hong Kong" other than the ransom, other than the ransom, The Leakers want to punish Teo Jit Sin by demanding that Amanah gives away USD $100M worth of MD5 to the public, as well as giving up its patent. We have contacted the Hong Kong Police. So far, Chun Yann is nowhere to be found. Sorry, Mr. Teo. Time for the board meeting, Mr. Teo. Fellow directors, because of the situation of my son, I will reveal the formula of "MD5", and also donate to those who are infected. I ask for your understanding of my decision. I object! It's not much concern... our company's...share price or loss. But let the board decide. Okay! Let's vote then! For those who agree with me, please raise your hand See? The voting result is out. Fine! We will not reveal the formula, but still donate USD $100M worth of MD5, which will be paid by myself No objection? Good! Chairman of the Amanah Pharmaceutical Corporation, Teo Jit Sin has agreed to purchase, in his own name, a USD $100M worth of MD5, and will donate the medicine to all epidemic areas. Both the World Health Organization and the medical field welcome this. It is said that some WHO committee members suggest that Mr. Teo Jit Sin be nominated for a World Philanthropy Award. How are you, Miss Yuen? Wong Dai Wai, police. How can I help you? Just a few questions. May I... Nobody can just come into somebody's place, not even the police. Um...I'm from Malaysia. I called you before. I'm Inspector Lee Weng Kan. Actually, we suspect that this case has something to do with Danny Song's death. So would you please cooperate with us? In fact, a lot of us are your fans. We read your articles because you always write from a genuine point of view. How do you know Teo Chun Yann was kidnapped? I know I didn't break any law. And I know my civil rights, too. As a journalist, I won't reveal my source. A journalist won't leave one to sink or swim, right? So I... You may remain silent, but anything you say may absolutely become part of what I will cover. He's really a police officer from Malaysia. He doesn't know much about the laws of Hong Kong. Keep going! I said it wouldn't work, didn't I? - Keep going! - Keep going! You're here to ask questions, go ahead! Sorry, Miss Yuen! Sorry to have bothered you, sorry! - Sorry, sorry, bye! - Nothing else to ask? Trust what I say. I could tell she's hiding something. Talk is cheap. We need evidence! Yes! The evidence was when she started videotaping you. Okay, so? How's it going? Has she showed up? No yet! - Here you go! - Thank you. Laksa. Authentic Malaysian dish. A very popular dish. No doubt it's rice noodles. It's Malaysian anyway. The Malaysian original tastes better. All right, give me that. Don't be so picky! It's pretty Malaysian. Are you married? No! Just about to! The wedding photos have been taken already. But I have to pick 10 of them. It's good that you're only just about to. You still have time to think about it. Did you divorce? No! Just about to! It's good to hear that. You still have time to think about it, too! Hello, madam? License no. UC2093, check it out, please! Thank you. The owner is a man by the name Ho Ban, with a criminal record. Assaulting a police officer and contempt of court, he's a field reporter. Your coverage is really something. It's made the Hong Kong Daily sell out in no time. It's top trending on the net, too What? Is someone following us? Sir, I'm following the reporter covering the Teo Chun Yann kidnap. Get our men ready, I'll call you as soon as I know where they're going. Your coverage is incredible. The free MD5 has saved a lot of people. Where is Teo Chun Yann? Please sit down! What is true? What is false? You think you know, actually you don't. I'm The Leaker. My father Teo Jit Sin has done a lot of unethical and unspeakably dirty things. He has been deceiving the public to win fame. He has not only deceived the government many times for grants to develop "orphan" medicines, but also bribed government officials to put below-grade medicine on the market. I've been collecting evidence of his crimes for many years. That's how I found out he manufactured VR-23 and MD5 at the same time. He spread VR-23 to cause panic first, then put MD5 on the market to earn a fortune from the disaster he initiated. The life and death of the virus-infected victims was never his concern. But my father is a man of wealth and power, he's connected to both government officials and the underworld. I needed a well-laid plan to be able to bring his crimes to light. That's why I started The Leakers... to liaise with people who have a sense of justice, including journalists and lawyers. The data stored on this hard disk... is the truth that everybody should know. Go! Up there! Benson Freeze! Freeze! Where are you keeping Teo Chun Yann? The Teo Chun Yann you're looking for... is right here. Teo Chun Yann I must take you back to Malaysia. You're a police officer, you should know how powerful my father is in Malaysia. I'll protect you when we return. As long as you hand me your brother's hard disk, I'll use it to arrest Teo Jit Sin The hard disk was damaged by the bomb blast in the hotel. You have no evidence to indict him. There have to be eyewitnesses. I'm the best one. Go back with me then. I'll tell the world that my father is a criminal... - in my own way. - Come with me! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! - What are you doing? - Drop the gun! You have no right to enforce the law here. Let go of me! I'm warning you! I told you... just look, don't touch. Are you turning a deaf ear or what? Are you out of your mind? What are you looking at? What? Police! Leave! Hey! I told you... Do you know the virus has spread here from Malaysia, my daughter is infected, and she's still in the hospital? I want to know what's going on! He just said so, got no evidence. You just let him go like that? Let who go? Did you see anyone here? I didn't! Are you nuts? Are you imagining things or what? My men have arrived. Talk to them about any complaints. Police, drop the gun! - Drop the gun! - Hey, hey, buddy! - Drop the gun! - Don't! Over here, here! He's one of us Call an ambulance! Ambulance! Jesus! Couldn't even get one photo. Are you okay? How's Benson? Gone! He didn't make it. Did he know you are linked with The Leakers? I found this mask in your bag. Danny Song gave me that. He invited me to join them when I worked in Malaysia last. Don't say "No!" to me this time. I will visit you in Hong Kong. "Bocca della Verita" Being a reporter has become more and more risky these days. We could lose our lives in no time. Therefore we must form an alliance... to reveal injustice the best we can. I agreed with them. Before Benson died, he wanted me to tell you on his behalf that... Tell Carly I wouldn't have stayed in this job... had it not been for her. It's alright, hang on. Is the ambulance here yet? Hey, you...Mr. Lee! I've got you some goodies to take home, so many germs there. Take me for authentic laksa or gui dew or whatever when I go to Malaysia next, okay? Oh, no! Please don't! We have nothing in common. Don't ever come, please! Let's not meet again Okay... Mr. Wong? Miss me already? C'mon, have a hug! Something which I must tell you. The law is the law. The Leakers is an illegal organization, no matter what. So if Teo Chun Yann... if he returns to Malaysia, I must arrest him myself. Certainly! You have all your rights in Malaysia, you may do whatever you want Hey, c'mon, keep it! There are so many germs on your side. You have to get yourself a wife and kids. This and that. So many things to do. Get rid of all the evidence! Yes, Mr. Teo! I had a bad dream, Dad! Oh, it's okay now, just a dream! Dad is here, I'll chase your bad dream away. Go away, go, go, go! Mom, Mom! She's waking up. Are you? I was so worried! Darling! Dad has to go to Malaysia for a couple days. Anything from there you want to eat, I'll bring it back to you, okay? Why are you going to Malaysia? It's hard to say "No!" as a civil servant There's a case to follow. Dad won't want to visit you here again when he returns. So keep it up! Yeah! Keep it up! I'm Carly Yuen I received a message from "The Leakers", that Teo Chun Yann has been released. I'm flying to Malaysia to follow this news. Chief! I got a message from The Leakers. They already killed the hostage. But I don't think the Hong Kong Police will release the news until they find his body. I'm Carly Yuen. This is Wong Dai Wai. Special report, according to a reliable source, The CEO of Amanah, Teo Jit Sin, whose second son, Teo Chun Yann, has been killed by The Leakers. If it is true, then Teo Jit Sin has "Teo Chun Yann killed Teo Jit Sin wept bitterly" lost two heirs in less than a month. "Teo Jit Sin lost two sons within a month" According to Police The CEO of Amanah, Teo Jit Sin's second son, Teo Chun Yann, was released. However, police did not disclose his whereabouts. The CEO of Amanah, Teo Jit Sin, has prepared a funeral parlor in his head office...for the public to mourn his first son, Teo Chun Loong. Since the parlor is open to the public, the police are concerned, and more than hundred police officers have been stationed there. But the police deny that the deployment is for fear that The Leakers may take further action. Hello? Are you on your way? All the guests are here, except the groom. What do you want me to tell them? There's nothing to tell them! How the hell could we know our wedding day would coincide with a big-shot's funeral? Just tell them...I'm a policeman on duty. And an urgent case is happening today. Okay, I promise you. I'll be right with you as soon as I'm done here. Hi, congratulations. Hi, thank you. My condolences, Mr. Teo. Thank you. Mr. Teo Chun Yann? Mr. Teo Chun Yann? Dad! Back off! Back off! Go outside! Back off! Why couldn't I find you? Please come with me to assist us in an investigation, Mr. Teo Chun Yann. Do you want to take Chun Yann in now? Yes! He kidnapped himself to blackmail you, we have to look into that. We might need your help later on, too, Mr. Teo. Just a second! Penguasa Kong! We are in the middle of Chun Loong's funeral. I know the law, but should it step aside a little under this circumstances. So can you do me this favor? Chun Yann and I will report to the police as soon as the funeral is over. It won't be long. Duan! The law is the law. Mr. Teo You have 15 minutes. Thank you. C'mon, my office! How long has it been since we last saw each other? Two years, 4 months, and 3 days. We met on Mom's birthday. That long? You started caring about your son just now, didn't you? I don't need to tell you how much I care about you. My brother paid my tuition fees and expenses all these years. Was your brother like the goose that laid the golden eggs or what? The money he sent you came from the company's profits. Five minutes left. What else have you got to yell at me? I'm used to it We're family, Chun Yann! Why can't we talk everything over? Nobody could ever talk in our family... but you! You did all the talking. Because none of you were ever willing to communicate with me. My brother was with you every day. I don't think you could communicate with him. Did you meet with him? Where's the hard disk? Do you have it? Give it to me! If I do, will you spare me? Good question. I would seriously think about it. The Teo father and son are missing, sir! Seal off the building, search everywhere! Stop, stop... Police! Go! Get after that car! Where is Lee going? Quick! Open the door! The car has broken down. Get behind the wheel. Hold it! Hey, my van! Stop the car! Why did you bring me here? What do you want? Even although the law can't bring him to justice, I want the world to know that he's a criminal in sheep's clothing. We'll interrogate Teo Jit Sin in front of the world, the public will find out what he is. Teo Jit Sin! This is where you began to get rich. I want you to tell the truth here. Fine! The truth is you people kidnapped me here. The truth is you obtained grants from the government for "orphan" medicines based on fake research and development reports between 1997 and 2003. You also bribed certain government officials to get their approval to put "orphan" medicines on the market during that period of time. Everyone knows how much I have helped infected patients with both money and "orphan" medicines. So your accusation is invalid. Put it on! See for yourself! All infected patients are waiting for the medicine. You made counterfeit medicines. They couldn't cure the patients Why did you do that? I couldn't cure their illnesses, but I cured their minds. I just wanted to give them hope. Give them hope? That was false hope! Don't you have a conscience? A conscience is for ordinary people. The result is what matters when you are doing great things. I don't care. I'll report you to the police if you don't stop. You want to ruin me. Why did you make this video? What do you really want from me? You were arguing with Mom that day. My brother and I were hiding there. The next day Mom was kidnapped. You said you wouldn't give in to the kidnappers. So no ransom was paid, which was what you said when you heard about my kidnap. After that, Mom vanished into thin air. You were behind all that. You feared that Mom would report you. So you killed her to keep her mouth shut. Are you imagining things or are you seriously ill? Earlier at the People's Housing Programme, two badly damaged lifts have been fixed and the residents can go back to their normal lives. Okay, that's all. Stop the wrong-doing. Bombing the Darwin Institute of Biology in Australia was also your idea. Keep going! Why would I want to do that? To destroy the evidence. I haven't got any evidence for... Mom's disappearance or the bombing of The Darwin Institute of Biology. But I have all the evidence for the subsequent crimes you committed. Bullshit! You deposited USD $10M into an account, which belongs to the Supervisor of the Darwin Institute. You asked him to secretly conduct virus research. What's wrong with asking the Institute to do research on viruses? I'm in the pharmaceutical business! What's wrong was, you wanted the Institute to work on ZIKA variants. But at the same time, you wanted a targeted wonder drug to be produced. You manufactured and spread VR-23, then put the new medicine on the market. That's how you made big money, and became the savior of the world. Sorry to disappoint you. I didn't do any of that. Teo Jit Sin! Your Judgment Day has come. It's not up to you to deny what you did. All the evidence is here! I'm just gonna say it one more time. I did not do any of that, no matter what you say. Did you not? Why did you kill the reporter, Danny Song, for this hard disk if you didn't do these things? Why did you kill my brother and his wife? Why are you people ganging up and accusing me of what I have not done? All right, deny all you can! I'll reveal what's on this hard disk to the public. The world will know what you have done in less than 3 minutes. Give me that! Watch this! Duan! Roger! We found them in an Amanah's abandoned plant. Okay, let's go right now! Teo Jit Sin! Do you plead guilty or not guilty? Since you know me so well, have you calculated how much I donate to charity every year? No one will believe it even if you put it on the net. Because your accusation is invalid. Since you say so, I'll upload it now, and see how the public responds to it. Hey! I learned this trick from you. I won't make the same mistake twice. Where's Teo Jit Sin? He'll be right here with you in 15 minutes, I promise. Okay? - This is Malaysia. - I know. You abducted Teo Jit Sin, and I'm a policeman, I have to do my job. Exactly! You're a policeman. Your job is to solve the case. The purpose of your job is to find the truth. I don't want to listen to this. Okay! Did you learn about Danny Song? Phang Zhen Mei? Benson Ho? Teo Chun Loong? You did, right? But there are VR-23 infected patients that you know nothing about. Are you gonna let them die without knowing why? He'll be here in 15 minutes, as simple as that! We've arrived, Duan! Where are you? Even if I could spare you 15 minutes, my colleagues out there might not agree. Don't be so sure. Hold! Hold! Put down the gun! I will kill him Understand? Duan! The television is broadcasting live in there. Our boss said no reckless moves! Okay! I'll sue you for slander. Why? Why did you, your brother, and mother want so much to ruin me? Stop talking! I planned to give you all I have. You're my son! I said, "Stop talking!" Do you know the worst thing that ever happened to me? Having you as my father! I really wish I hadn't been born, that I'd never existed in this world. You must be condemned to hell for the towering crimes you committed. I may be despicable and shameless to you. But after all I am your father. You may disrespect me, but you shouldn't gang up with strangers to slander me. You shouldn't gang up to pull me down. Shut your mouth! Go to hell! Chill! - Don't come near! - Calm down. You want me dead. No need to find yourself any excuse. Just pull your gun on me. Right here! C'mon! Pull the trigger! Do it, you piece of shit Go! Go! Go! Go! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! I was defending myself, but it went off by accident. Arrest him! Go get the others! Teo Jit Sin! I want the world to get a close look at you. We'll see what they say. What if Teo Jit Sin denies all the evil things he did? Where there's truth, there's sacrifice. Don't worry, you're gonna be okay. Why did you want to expose your father? I hate to... live in his illusion And you? I'm a journalist. Here is the divorce settlement agreement. Please take a look. You can sign your name if you don't have any questions. Cheers! Cheers! Well, we are friends now! Long time no hug! After a 6-month criminal trial, the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled that... Teo Jit Sin was not guilty of murdering his son, Teo Chun Yann, but was guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and sentenced to 20 years in jail. At the same time, the Court acquitted Teo Jit Sin of all other charges against him. As for Teo Jit Sin's civil case against the news reporter, Carly Yuen, for slander. The Court ruled that Carly Yuen was guilty of slander. Carly Yuen had to pay Teo Jit Sin 1 USD in compensation. "In memory of Chi Sen Yan and his hard work"
