Gerard, Did you know on the inside was special mushrooms? Yes! Mmm-mmm-mmm. Simply delicious, marcus. I keep tellin' your mom she should take some cooking lessons from you. All she do is cook pork. I'll bet we've eaten everything on the pig... From the rooter to the tooter. - The whole pig, huh? - You didn't marry me for my cooking. You got that right, baby. That's why we got little junior over there. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! Must you embarrass me in front of my friends on every possible occasion? Now, see... see there? That's your son. - Private school got him all "sadiddy" like that. - Yeah, man. Chill. It's your father. Mr. Jackson, angela made this meal. It wasn't me. I can't take credit for it. [ mr. Jackson ] mmm. Very good. [ mrs. Jackson ] very good. Hmm. Good pick, junior. [ gerard ] daddy! I told you that angela and I are just friends. Mm-hmm. [ sucking teeth ] just friends, huh?

Your parents are smokin' a joint in my bathroom? No. They been in there fuckin'. [ laughs ] Whoo! [ sighs ] Damn. Goodness. What's for dessert? Wow. I'm all right, man. Let's go. Let's go eat, man. Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? No, no, no. That's all right. I'd better run my parents home before ty embarrass me any further. Okay. I had a great time. I'll call you tomorrow. Me too. Bye. Mrs. Jackson. [ groaning ] I cannot tell y'all how much fun it is to be with y'all and... So good. Oh, a piece of coat, I think. Ohh, boy, the rabbit is getting old, baby. Lookie there. We'll tear another piece off and make some earrings. We'll coordinate. Oh! Yeah, that'll work. [ tyler ] yo, yo, yo, yo. Got a hookup for tonight. Who? Remember that little girl I met in emergency?

[ chuckles ] Angela? Yes? I'm gonna have to take you up on that offer. Thought so. Yes. Chitlin juice everywhere, and I don't know if I can handle it alone. I am so tired, I don't care if I never see another cup, plate, again in my life. My. Oh, my feet are killg me. Can I take my shoes off? Yeah, you can. You'll have the whole house smellin' like funky corn chips. Please. My feet do not stink. Star trek's comin' on. I love star trek. Do you really? Yeah. I'm a trekkie. Get outta here! I'm a trekkie! Look at cap... Ain't captain kirk the coolest white man on the planet? You know, you can always tell who's gonna get killed when you watch this show. Now, look... look who's beamin' down. You see kirk, mccoy, spock... And yeoman johnson. Now, doesn't yeoman johnson know he's gonna get killed? If I was yeoman johnson, I'd say, "hey, I'm not goin'. I know what's gonna happen." It's amazing how you've just sort of broken down this whole star trek thing. Well, I'm a trekkie. That's why I broke it down to the barest essence of the trek. I'm a trekkie. I know everything about star trek. What's captain kirk's first name? "captain." No, it's not "captain." his name is james t. Kirk. What is mr. Spock's last name? Huh? You didn't even know that. The name is spock jenkins. One of the jenkins boys from vulcan. It's, uh... we'll talk about it later. ♪ [ tv: "star-spangled banner" ] Hey, what are we doing? We're kissing.

The white ball dominates everything, right? It knocks the shit out of the yellow ball, the red ball, right? And the game's over when the white ball drives the black ball... Completely off the table. [ grunts ] - Now, why is that? - I don't know, but I'm sure you'll tell me, My "brotha." Sure. You right. Look, It's because of the white man's fear... Of the sexual potency of black balls. That one was kind of interesting. That was interesting. - [ tyler ] you see, what was... - I see where you're going. And the pool table is earth. That's why it's green. Oh, see, your shit is comin' out now. - And the world, they used to think it was flat. - School h. - When you do the oprah winfrey show, I'm gonna be front row! - It's not about jokes. - Me and him are here.

I don't believe this shit. Why you askin', man? You can't even look me in my eye, can you, marcus? Did you sleep with angela? Yeah, I did. [ sighs ] Why do you always have to have all the girls, marcus? You said a couple of seconds ago you didn't care who she went out with; now you're flippin'. You're bein' a hypocrite. I don't wanna hear that bullshit, man! This is different. Angela is a nice girl. So I can't be with a nice girl? No. 'cause all you're gonna do is dog her out like you do every woman in your life. Okay. Tell me this, man. Why angela? What? She has nice feet? Oh, it has nothing to do with her feet or anything like that, man. I care about this girl. Man, you don't care about nobody but yourself, man! [ groans ] So when we can rise as a people, we runnin' things, you know? What'd you do, man? Guess. [ shower running ] Marcus, come quick!

Do you like it? Yes, very much. Okay, 'kay, 'kay. Look at it... And tell me how it makes you feel. Honestly, it's makin' me kind of horny. No. Feel. And I would like to be and I would like to think I was the inspiration for that blue man. You should be blue. You're gonna get paint all over me. [ telephone rings ] exactly. The phone's ringing. Take those clothes off. Take 'em off. Off. [ giggles ] no. [ phone beeps on ] hello? Jacqueline, hi! How you doin'? He's right here, actually. No. No, we weren't busy at all. Here he is. Okay. Hey. Yeah. No, that was angela. She just stopped by for a second. Uh-huh. Really? Oh, that's... hey, hey. Your spot tested through the roof. Yeah, she's happy. Uh-huh. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Oh, that's perfect. Great. Yeah. Peace. Hey. Hey, they're showin' the spot to the board of directors on Friday night, And jacqueline wants me to be there. Great. Wait. You don't have a problem with that, do you? No, no. Hey, I will call her, and I'll tell her that... you sure? Cool. That's bad. Blue people. [ speaking french ] [ men chuckling ] [ continues in french ] hey, hey. Le peace. Chill. [ continues in french ] Les plumes. You are brilliant! God, marcus, they loved it! They loved it. Did you hear the little frenchman screaming "magnifique"... With a little bead of sweat runnin' down his face, man? - I knew I had that cat. - Marcus, you are incredibly talented. Well, I thank you. Lady eloise thanks you. Tell her I said "hey." I'm sure strange... Would like to thank you personally. - Yeah, she'd like to thank the hell out of me. - [ Laughing ] I have to say, It's very nice to have the old marcus back. I was kind of worried about ya. Really? You seemed, um... you seemed so... - I don't know. Can I be honest? - Please. Well, you seemed desperate and unsure of yourself. [ chuckling ] Pathetic? Aha. Kind of pathetic. Uh-huh. Look at you now. You're, uh... you're relaxed. You're more confident. Just like the man I met in that elevator. I got it goin' on again. Yeah, you do. I like it. I find it very attractive. How'd it go last night? It went okay. Just okay? It must've gone pretty well. You didn't get home until the middle of the night. I went for a walk so I could sort some things out that was in my head. - I was trippin' on it. - Like the fact that you're still in love with jacqueline? Angela, I saw the woman, And a bunch of stuff that was in me I didn't even know was still there came out. Things happened, and... There's certain things you just have no control over, all right? Really? Like what? Like love. Love? You know, what do you know about love? What do you possibly think you know about love? You know, I'm sick and tired of men using love like it's some kind of disease you just catch. Love should've brought your ass home last night. Didn't you just hear me say I was sorry? I heard you say you're sorry. You're sorry, and you're tired. You don't love me. You don't love jacqueline. - You only love your damn self. - How could you say I never cared about you? Jacqueline says I'm a better person now, and I owe that all to you. I'm outta here. I'll get the rest of my things later. Let me just tell you one more thing. I might not be all glamorous, And I don't have hair weaved all down my back, but let me tell you one great thing about me. I've got a heart. And you know the bad thing about having a heart, marcus, Is that it gets broken when you deal with people like you. Now, stay thfuck outta my life! [ thunderclap ] She left you, huh? Yeah, she did. [ sighs ] I guess I should feel happy, but I don't. I hate to see another person in pain. Well, thank you very much. That's very nice of you, yvonne. Good night. So, uh, would you like to come over for a cup of coffee? Not even if jesus was pourin' it. Some motherfuckers are so blind they can't see a good thing when it's starin' them in the face.
