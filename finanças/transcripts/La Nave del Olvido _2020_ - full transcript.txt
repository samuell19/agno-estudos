Come with me to the hill to celebrate the communion! This town has been blessed! God wants us to experience these lights with humbleness! Don't fear them! If you don't confront him... Hello, neighbor! I saw you arrive with a lot of things. Are you moving here? What? If you are going to live here? You are paying attention. That's because there's not much to do here. Don't you see that I'm always alone? My husband travels all the time for work. - Sorry if I bothered you. - No, no problem. I'm going to see you more often then. Your daughter doesn't talk much. I hope you won't be the same. That's true. She doesn't talk much. It's just that I get bored. - Do you smoke? - Yes. But I just ran out of cigarettes. I was going to buy some now. Do you want me to bring you pack? OK. What happened? Did you take it away from him? No. He died. And that was the only thing he left me. But I don't know what to do with it. I don't even know how to drive. - Well then, sell it. - No. It's too soon. Learn how to drive then. I'm too old to learn. I can teach you, if you want. - And end up wrapped around on a tree. - No! Yes, that's what happened to me last time. Since then, my husband never lent me the car. Why didn't you snatch it? Oh yeah! I used it the other day. But I'm not good at those things. It's not that hard. Look Claudina. - What a beautiful lamp. - Yes, it's pretty. I like because it's kind of magic. - Oh, really? - Yes, but it's not for sale. What a pitty. What I like most about it is that it has no switch, you see? Yes. Hey, if...If it's not for sale, why do you have it there? So that people ask me and I can say that it's not for sale. And because it's pretty, and that way everyone can look at it. I have seen you before. Me too. My name is Ignacia, and you? Claudina. That would be $5.800. ... $5.000... ... $5.000... ...$600, $5.700. No, I'll pay mine, don't worry. No, I will pay this time. - You invite me later. - Ok. Alright. That's it. I know that, I know that. Almost... Where? Where? You have to guide me here. Oh ok, ok. - You have to go that way, to the door. - I take it, I take it. There it goes. There it goes. It's good that we met. Yes. Your house is strange. Strange? I don't know, strange. Since when are you living here? It's almost a year now. But, we move a lot. Look. I bought it from a lady on the street. Sit down! That's what I like about this town. Thank you. What was your house like? We've lived there since we got married. Eugenio got a job, and they gave him that house. Do you have children? No, not a chance. Since I was young, I traveled a lot. having kids it was like cutting my wings. Also later, I met Esteban. And he understood. And you? Just one daughter? Yes. You have always lived in Lautaro? Until I got married. As a child I wanted something to get me away from here, but... I even asked God. You prayed to God? Yes, yes. But I was very small. My dad was very strict. And my mom said nothing. I couldn't stand it anymore. Later, I had to get married. Ale was born. I got married very young. And before Eugenio, I had never been with any man like that. Do you understand me?, right? You are very different. You're not like the women from this town. Different? Strange? No. Unique. Are they perhaps signs that the world as we know it, will end? We have the UFO expert Mayra Nicitich, and the priest Diego Soto, To answer this, and other questions.

That's it...smoothly. To level it. Hey! Very good! OK, what if I press it a little more? Now I will get scared. No, no, no. Shit! That's what it was. Yes, that's it. I love the smell of the peels. My husband liked it too. Did you loved him very much? I don't know. But he was a good friend. A good partner. By the end, that's what you look for in people, right? So, you've never been in love, Claudina? Once, I think. But I was very young. It was the first time I felt I was in love. I've been in love plenty of times. Esteban knows everything. I don't think he cares. Tell me more! Who have you fallen in love with? We had like... 18 years old. I was in high school. I remember that we saw each other. I thought she was the most beautiful person I've ever met. I only wanted to be her friend. But... I didn't knew how to get close to her. I didn't dare to. One day, she came up to me and asked for a pencil. And we became inseparable. Sometimes we went to the hill. Where the Christ is. She would tell me stories about the city. We loved to hear the rain. And one day. She kissed me. Her name was Amparo. Yes. They saw her. I tell you. They get out of this town, and they think they're something else. They think no one knows. But, who told you? Her aunt. I met her at the supermarket. Oh, yes! I was thinking, we could go to a place I know. What place? "El Porvenir" Have you been there? No, no. I don't think I can go. Why? What do you have to do? A lot of thing. Well, that's enough. What's wrong with you? Well, it's fine. I'll be there. It's crossing the bridge. I have to get ready. If you come to throw me your cross, go away immediately! - Or I'll leave you here! - Hello. I'm not from any church. Come in! You have a puritan face, I confused you with a local woman. Maybe you don't remember, but we've known each other for a long time. From school. No. Your face is not familiar. I am Claudina. Amparo introduced us, do you remember? Oh, yes! Claudina. Oh God, my dear. Life has really mistreated you! Come in! Come in! Enter. This is the only place where you can have a good time. Have fun. "Facundo and Ambrosio" doesn't exist anymore. You can call me Ambrosía. Eat from me... And shine. Because if you don't shine, you don't exist. I knew that you were married with... a foreman. - What was his name? - Eugenio. Ah, I didn't like him at all. He farts higher than his ass, and in the middle of his head. I'm looking for a friend whose name is Elsa. But I haven't seen her around here. Because this is "El Porvenir", right? No. This is not "El Porvenir." This is my home. You will know that your destiny Joins with mine I've waited you in every corner I have looked for you everywhere Your kisses give me life What my soul longs for To live disenchantments You will know, my dear, that your destiny joins with mine You will know that the wind blows another way My heart There is. My friend! So long! You've been ungrateful, you haven't called me at all. We've been really busy with Cristobal and Ale. Hey, I heard that you were seen leaving the big house. Which is at the other side of the bridge. What were you doing there? I have a friend who lives there. - I hadn't seen him in a long time. - Oh, I see. - I have to go, bye. - Bye Clau! Call me! I will rescue those who love me I did nothing. What should I do? Nothing. What are you going to do? It's alright. Come. Shall we dance? We are in my house and here we dance. Grandma, did you see the thing the other night? - What thing? - Nothing. The light went out. And if it was night and the lights went out, how could I see? What a bad joke! Hey! Not bad. Look. Why are you laughing? It was bad? Let me see! Hey mom, what you will do today? I will go next door. Be careful mom, ok? Why? Because you know that people talk. And now you live with me, in my house. I wanted it so much. The fat woman with the flowered blouse. - But she was very out of tune. - Oh yes! Everyone was laughing at her, but she is happy. There are some people singing. She is happy. I really like this t-shirt. - You like it really much? - Yes! - It looks very nice. - I give it to you. - Really? - Yes. I want to be like you when I grow up. But, like me. Do what you do. But as I am now. - You can't have all that you want. - Sure. I would love to have your energy. But that fades as the years go by. If I had your energy, I would change a lot of things. And what would you change? I would be a photographer. I wouldn't have married young. I would travel to many places. I don't know why I'm telling you this. Because you like me. I don't know quite well what I want. I just know that I don't want to lose the opportunities that appear. That's all that I know. And why don't you leave this town? Where everyone cares about everyone. I don't know. I really don't know. What about you? Ignacia, get in! Sorry. Why don't you go out anymore, Facundo? Don't call me like that. Ambrosia. One of this days we should go to Temuco. - Or something like that. - Yeah, I go outside. The thing is, when I open here. It will be good for you to rest. No, I really enjoy to be here. To serve my people. So they see that there is freedom here. I don't want them to go around saying that I don't open because... I'm old and I'm afraid of this town. - That wants to close the doors - No! Nobody will move me! I didn't say "to Close." I said "go out." We look like hares! And these two? Really sexy these fucking old bitches. And you're really ugly to be queer. We don't want to get in trouble, young man. We are old to have more drama. With all due respect, mam. Is this your husband or your wife? Look motherfucker! You must learn to respect! We are all people here! You are a person, I am a person, and... Easy, easy. We're not do anything to your mom. Why don't you come and sit with us for a while? - Just a while, come here. - Motherfucker! I only wanted to have a drink. I'll beat you up, assshole! Elsa. I really love you. I love you too, sweety. Why don't we leave here? Let's leave this town. How are we going to leave? This is not our place. You say that because of last night? That's silly. Wouldn't you like to live somewhere else? More peaceful? We could go to the beach together. I have a cousin who has a house in Villarrica. Being able to walk embraced in the street. Nobody watching us as aliens. And where would you go? Somewhere else. Well, when you find that place. I will gladly go with you there. I would've liked to have met you before. Perhaps you wouldn't be here with me. Maybe. I had never felt so happy. How silly. Getting old and just now feeling like this. How did you do it? What thing? Being with women? I've never been this long with a woman before. You would heve to leave your husband. Let's leave this town together! What were you doing next door with that old woman? Her name is Elsa. And she is not old. She looks fucking old. Why you were dancing together? I was passing by mom. I saw you. And to top it, without the curtains open, as if everything was normal. Mom? This is my home. I told you once, and I will not repeat it. I don't want everyone talking about me or you because of the dirty things are you doing. What dirty things am I doing? - About a dance? - A dance? Do you think I am stupid? Do you think that I don't know what everyone is talking about you? That you are crossing the bridge to go to that house full of fucking queers. You don't know what you are talking about. I love those people. You don't know their names. You don't even know them. Fuck! So now they are people you love. Terrific! Yes! I love them all. What are you talking about mom? What are you saying? Mom. - People that you love? - Yes. And your family? Ah? Your family? Have you thought about Cristobal? Aren't you ashamed? Please, stop. Calm down mom! Shut up Cristobal! - Shut up! - Stop. Look, mom. I am again in someones mouth because of your filthy things. You will have to leave this house immediately. And won't care where you end up. Did you hear me? Don't take her seriously. - Hi grandma. - Hi grandson. My mom asks if your going to have breakfast. And I wanted to know if you woke up alive. I am alive. And I'll go for breakfast right away. Can you imagine if you were to die now, and this were the last roof that you saw? What would you do? Does it looks like yours? Yes, it's similar If I died now, this roof will be the same as all roofs that I saw in my life. Right? No, because my roof is full of things that I really like. So, I will do the same. I will stick on the roof all the things that I love. Why? Do you want die here? I don't want to die, and I will go to have breakfast in a minute. I will tell her.
