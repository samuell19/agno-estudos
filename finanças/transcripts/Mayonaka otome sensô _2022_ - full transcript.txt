The one who loves midnight is a maiden. The one who hates midnight is yet again a maiden. Maiden is not only a woman, Even a man is a maiden. The one who loves is a maiden. The person who is loved, and the person who is not loved as well, the one who doesn't love is also a maiden. I wonder where is the love tonight... I long for the arrival of such midnight, where I don't need to clutch my phone. I want memories that can be remembered for eternity. Or else... I'm waiting for the end of the world. By the way... Did love save the world? We maidens wage war. Since my admission to university, 20 days, 11 hours and 50 minutes have passed. I was born in Tokyo and raised in Kobe. By the time I swipe... I hope this boring class would end already. By the way, this movie will be over in just 110 minutes. There, there, shut up. The clock turns 12 and the stupid chime resounds. At that moment, I saw myself. The image of me in a coffin, grey-haired, without ever having met the moment of my life. But, that's wrong... The only thing that should burn is this extremely boring university. I'm really sorry for being rude and asking such question. Honestly, I don't understand if this lecture will even be useful. Shakespeare, Old English... How is this useful? And the rest of my lectures are the same. And French too. "Bonsoir" won't help me in my life, not even when I die. - Then don't come to my lectures. - That's the problem. I came to attend your lectures because of my scholarship debt. Because it's a required subject. Because of that, I need to cut down on my sleeping hours and earn my own money. While at it, I calculated how much I pay for each lecture. 3000 yen, which is 3 hours of my mom's part time job. I can buy a brand-new technical book with this money... Or a basic Netflix subscription for 3 months. I have been always thinking, is spending that much money on these 90 minutes worth it? I'm afraid, I need you to tell me more than that. Let's start from the beginning. Me after 5 days of enrollment. In the future continuous form, the verbs will be in ing form. I got a part-time high-paid job as a private tutor early on. And it was a relief to live with enough money for a while. Understand? Ah... That is too sudden... Our company has decided to reduce the number of part-time workers significantly, I can't help it. But I need this job. I was fired. Kuki Wakame Japanese seaweed snack. Do you like it? Huh? Kuki Wakame. Excuse me. Job vacancies. Hello. You didn't submit the scholarship application? Aaaahh... I'll submit it. Don't give me that "aaaahhh". If you miss this scholarship, you won't be able to attend the university. I know, I know... I'll do it! I'm begging you, I already give you all the money I can. Yeah. So, how's your "living fund"? I work as a tutor to earn some money. Really? You can teach people and stuff like that? Yep, so don't worry, I'm fine, really. I see. Take care of yourself. Sure. Goodbye. Hurry or we won't make it in time. Hey. These flowers will rot! Hey, we have to ship it tonight, I'm freaking tellin' you, you won't make it in time. Hey, hurry up, work, hey! Hey, you idiots, hurry up! Stop messing around, hurry up! Hey, you old fart! - What the fuck you're doing? - I'm sorry! - I told you to hurry the fuck up or I will kill you! - I'm... I'm sorry! You're gonna work nonstop until morning! If we won't finish loading these, we won't make it in time! There's no end to them. Don't think I'm gonna pay you just for this, work harder. Twitter trending: 1. Kuki Wakame. 2. SSR Gacha. 3. Personality test. - Why is it even trending? - It's my first time eating Kuki Wakame, so crunchy and delicious! - Kuki Wakame? - Kuki Wakame are those things in bags? - Kuki Wakame is trending? You're so fucking slow at this. Don't answer with "yes", answer with "woof”. - Woof. - Good, one more. - Woof. - Come on, more, more. - Woof. - Nice, nice. Now scram, quickly. - Yes, yes. - I said scram! - Woof! Idiot. - WOOF! We can't make it in time! Hey! Hurry up, idiots! Stop messing around! Hurry up! And then, the clock turned 12. To get into this university I studied endlessly and slept just 6 hours a day. Driven by the inertia of boredom I attend these lectures, while slacking off every time. In short, the problem on my side… Stop it! Damn! You're really bad at this. What an idiot. “じゃん”？ When I'm around guys from Tokyo, I speak standard Japanese, trying to learn it bit by bit. But I'm not bragging. I've joined a club and been hanging out with them. Y'know I already had sex with like 10 people. I met a girl from Hiroken University, so pretty! And you? Found a club? - Nah, not yet. - Come on, decide already. - Hey there. - Yo! We're high school... Classmates. - Wanna go to Golden Gai later today? - Oh, nice, let's go! Are you two going too? Yep, yep, yep. Again. - Again? - You don't know? There was an arson in smoking area on campus. - Why？ - No idea. What kind of idiot would even do this? If people find out, you're done. I heard there were some graduates who couldn't get employed just because they beat up some homeless guy. I don't want to be loved by everyone. Just being loved by few people is fine for me. Even I thought of becoming such an ordinary person. Are such mundane problems a luxury? Hide and seek club. We are a secret society. Therefore, new students are not welcome. Admission fee: 1000 yen. Established: 1995. Activity date: anytime. Place: all around the world. Those who wish to join the club will be interviewed. Only 2 out of 100 got accepted last year. No romance in the club allowed. Entries are accepted by email. I didn't expect anything to happen in April, and hadn't given up on life yet. - Did you attend entrance ceremony? - I didn't go. - School hymn? - I don't sing. - Dean's name？ - I don't know. When you entered university, what was the most memorable thing to you? - Seeing Tokyo Tower. - Tokyo Tower? It was very impressive. And how would you describe it? It's... the root of all misery... Do you hate it? Tokyo Tower? No way. If you could join this group, what would you want to do? I don't know. Destroy. What? Everything. What is it that you want to destroy? Many things come to mind... But... The thing I want to destroy the most is myself. That's it for the interview. There will be a welcome party tonight. There you go. Uhm... Yes? There are other people behind you too. I'll bring it. Hey, you've been stuck to that wall for like 2 hours already. You seem like the "root of all misery" to me now. And for me it's this view. Oh, I see, well... Was all this time really worth 3 months of Netflix? You know, what you said really made me think about the value of the money, and the things that I pay for without much thought. - Here's your scotch mist. - Thanks. Hey, you're great. Oh? Wait, you don't know? Here. Stupid college student got shot down by a professor in an instant at the end of the lecture You're super viral, you know? Guess you won't see me at university anymore. Think of this failure as something exclusive to university students, and just start living tomorrow. I didn't say I'm gonna die. I just don't want to make another mistake. I see. There are different things and different people. But you know, for us college students... The most important thing is to have fun and be embarrassed. If you feel like talking, I'll be at that table. Today is the scholarship exam, you have to do well. I think you understand that too. Fire! Fire! Careful, hey! Do you still have time? Huh? But that's not your car. Now it's mine. “Kuki wakame”... Is that your doing? Yeah, that was for you. That's just nonsense. Thanks to you, It's out of stock everywhere. What's up? Grumpy again? So, you're also the one causing arsons everywhere. What arsons? Huh? He said he's Kirishima. But that is just one of many names he likes to use. That's why from now on I'm gonna call him "Black Suit". Later, I learned that he didn't even have a driver's license. And he also had erectile dysfunction, but that needs a bit of explanation. In the 3rd grade of high school he had created a porn website. And in the process of creating it, he browsed for too much porn at the time. But a few years later his porn site got several hundred million page views a month. When he got tired of doing that, he made a schedule and matching app for university students. Both his passive and active income guaranteed him enough money for the rest of his life. Yet none of this was actually something he truly liked to make. Once I realized that I saved a lot of money, I always wanted to go to university. And you? I studied for it. Do you like studying? Not at all. Then why do you keep doing things you don't like? Because running away won't make it even better. I just want to live a normal life. I want to have a family, a house with a garden. So first I should study hard and get a job in a good company. Just for that, I have to deceive myself as much as I can. Then why did you help me earlier? Do you know why people who want to be happy, can never actually be happy? Because they keep detesting themselves. The moment you start longing for a normal life, you'll never get it. But when you finally get it, the only thing left to do is protect it. Is that fun? No one will tell you how to be happy. You have to find and build happiness yourself. But still... There will be obstacles and when they come, there's only one thing we can do. That is war. Hey. Why do you live? You... Why do you die? I hate when people ask me such questions. Talking about it is ridiculous. I feel like life has no meaning. Hahaha… Keep it a secret, or others can find out. Okay, demon/ogre counts to 100. １　２　３　４　５ ６　７　８　９　10 11　12　13　14　15　16 19　20　21 22　23　24　25 26　27　28　29　30… Soooo... What is this? Why are you here? I'm observing people. But you can't even see anyone from here. Okay, come out. Yeah. Quickly. You're alone right? Can you come with me to the office? Wait! That's where you are. I'm sorry. You know, when he's not in the mood, he hides in this trash can. I will scold him properly! You're something! Come on, apologize! Here! Well... Forgive him, okay? - It's okay now. - Sorry. I'm really sorry for the trouble he caused, forgive him. It's just lately there were these bombings at university and so on. Yes. We thought it would be dangerous to leave him alone here. Well... - Sorry! I'm sorry. That was a nice hiding spot though! Don't worry, the ogre/demon won't come here. I see. If I win, the dinner is on you. What if you win? - Why don't we go to Tokyo Tower? - Seperately? To... together... Ah, that's impossible! 7-10 Split is really hard to execute perfectly. But that's okay, you're right handed, so you tend to aim for 10 pin, but If you aim for 7 pin, you can win. - Who is he? - Ah... Well, he is... I'm playing hide and seek too. Were you also in hide-and-seek club? Ah, seven pin. Awesome, it turned out just like you said! No one can stop Senpai who recently got a job at a publishing company. How do you know that? I know few things about you. You went to Planetarium yesterday. Huh? You are also in 5 other clubs aside from this one. As for siblings, you have a brother, but no sisters. On the day of your first sex... Stop it, thanks. So, do you know only about me or other people too? Well... I definitely know what will happen to Senpai in the future. - And what is it? - Wanna hear? If you wish... He will tell you about it. - Huh? - What do you mean? Come on, you don't get a chance like this every day. She... She will throw a ball. Well, that was a waste of time. Nice! Are you leaving? You can treat me next time. Still, how do you know about Senpai? How did you even find me today? - Why were you even looking for me? - That's a secret. But you should remember... When you really need somebody, you meet the right person at the right time. That was how I lived my whole life. And I got to meet you too. No matter how you look at it, this place was something out of the ordinary. Cinema is one of few entertainments that humanity still hasn't forgotten. As majestic as in church. And also as lonely. - Do you live here? - Yeah. But that buddy lived here before me. - No Netflix or stuff like that? I prefer to decide for myself which movies I want to have. Imagine one night you can't watch a movie you really wanted. Could you live with that? Let's watch something. After watching all these masterpieces, Tokyo's nightview... Is kinda dull, you know? Wanna do something about it? Maybe... Why don't we just blow it all to hell? That night we found broccoli, which were thrown out and left to die. At first, it only needed to be seen by those who could see it What the hell is this? Who? Who left it here? If even one idiot spots it, It would cause an instant buzz, but for us it didn't matter. Black suit preferred movies about crime, war and various documentaries. While I liked classic late 90s Japanese movies. Both of us liked disaster movies. You're that monkey. For each movie we watched, we launched an attack. Yo! So, what's gonna happen to me in the future? Kidding. I'm sorry. Let me buy you a dinner. I don't have hopes, but I'll be waiting. How's the club? Got to know everyone's faces and names? - Not yet. - I only recognize your face. Are you always by yourself? I just don't have friends. Well, as we're in the same club, I think I consider you my friend. - But if you don't think of me as a friend, then what am I to you? - Senpai. - Senpai is Senpai. - Listen... We should treat younger people like older and older people like young. - And who said that? - I heard Toyotomi Hideyoshi say that in a movie. - But didn't he go crazy in his late years and started doing many things that made no sense? Well, it doesn't mean that things which Nietzsche said are also not right. Nietzsche... Did he go crazy too? You know, people who take everything seriously get broken easily. I guess, because everything in this world to these people seems serious. And the only way they could live is by being broken. Hey, tell me your LINE. See ya. She's the first person in university with whom I exchanged LINE. However, I still didn't know this guy's LINE. No. I didn't even need to know. Because I could always meet with him here. Movies should be watched by others too, right? But, who will even come to a place like this? They will come. Without a doubt. If you send a DM to 1000 students and invite them to a movie night, 10 of them will agree and reply. And only one of them will come with ice cream and sweets in their hands. Black Suit was a DM terrorist. The professor on my seminar was an old guy who constantly sexually harassed me. But everyone just said that it was skinship. They wouldn't take me seriously. To tell the truth, Until today, in the university's toilet I was making a bomb. I was gonna blow up the whole lab to pieces and die in the process. If you feel like it... Give me a push. Thank you. I'm glad I actually came here. I'm glad I met you here. It seemed like all of them were either kicked out of school Or were destined to such fate in the future. This guy spent 3 years preparing for an entrance exam, because he kept failing it, repeated the second year twice as his academic performance was poor and now he is about to repeat it for the third time. With his tuition money he could have bought a whole house. Literature student with a bleak future. She's a business student who hides electric saw in her room, to avoid the violence of her "kitchen drinker" alcoholic mother.. They became regulars here. They became our friends. - I'll help you with it. - Understood, so that time... Really, anytime you want. Setting up school buses which roam around the university while humming a song, that was our idea. Hijacking university database and posting fake class cancellations. Oh, also, just look at the fresh new university website homepage. Oops, but we're the ones behind it. Flyers fluttered down the rooftop like snowflakes during blizzard. Setting off fireworks everyday. It was also done by us. While I was admiring the indulgent blaze in the midsummer night's sky, I was evicted from my apartment for not paying rent. People who are really stuck in this life... What can you even do for them? He always blames me. I didn't do anything wrong, he's the one at fault! I hope he dies. Either shut up and listen to them... Or lend them lots of money. You are exhausted day by day. Overcrowded trains, boss insults, sleep deprivation. And the next thing you realize, you're just getting exploited. We have everything here to work without seeing other people. For the time being, refrain from any unnecessary social activities and take some time for yourself. I can at least lend you money to make it possible. Thank you so much! I noticed that the dance floor was filled with diverse regulars. Woof! Woof! - Oh... - Woof! That is Mr. Matsumoto who is currently undergoing rehabilitation for aphasia, because he was forced to say Woof due to power harassment. Stop it! “Are you at uni now?” “Yeah.” “What is this location?” “I wonder...” “Did you find the Thanos stone?” “Maybe it is Thanos stone.” “I will be in a red hat.” “Is it right?” You did great! What's this place? It's nice, right? I haven't seen you around lately, busy much? Every day and night I'm just bored to death. But deep inside me I'm busy to death. I see. Well, as long as you're alive, I'm happy for you. Let's go. Long time ago... People from movie club were building a set here. How did you find this place? Me and Kana found it while we were playing hide and seek. We skipped countless classes here with Kana over last 4 years. Kana... She had an offer in a big company, but I think she dropped it. - Why? - No idea. But she says that maybe someone is setting her up. We target every person who does not think and act for themselves. To thrive in this rotten system of the world is to reproduce the system. And all such people will be baptized by us without exception. She was so depressed. Poor one. Everyone... Feels angry, has doubts, but always keeps them to themselves. Still, everyday we try to do our best. I wonder... Is it some evil that must be defeated? So, what's your dream? - My dream? - Yeah. I don't know. What about you? My dream... I want to write a book that would be worth dying for. My life's been full of shit, but I keep thinking about one book. A book that would make you feel happy for living in this world. If I could write at least one such book, my life would be complete. I bet my life on it. Everyone bets their entire life on something. So, what is your bet? A serious of vicious pranks have been reported all over Tokyo. Three in Shinjuku-ku, Toshima-ku, Chiyoda-ku last month... Autumn... Everything will perish. People who hate summer fall in love with autumn. It is our season. There were no injuries reported. Damage to public property, graffiti... There are more regulars now, and Black Suit became a symbol of our comradeship. He gave them cat polaroid photos. The regulars of secret society TEAM, who do everything as Black Suit pleases. People whispered about us like we were some kind of "mirage", mysterious entity, and if we did something, we would be told to "die" or "go away," causing a storm of criticism. But among this storm of disapproval, there were still faint voices of occasional minorities which screamed "do more". All this meant nothing to us. And while we were busy playing Hana Ichi Monme, Black Suit wiped out 1 million people's data from social networks. Why? Why? Why? Guys, is everyone else gone too? Will they bring it back? No, this is the conspiracy by the government! I've been telling you for a long time! Japan is just getting crazier and crazier. The war between us maidens and everyone else who is a part of the corrupt system of the world is about to begin. - 1 million deleted people - It's nice that they deleted all accounts I didn't need. - I wonder how did they do it? - Maybe they deleted some accounts intentionally. What's your job? Police officer, and you? Ministry of Finance, but I quit. Listen... I slaved myself away to death at work and realized something. Someday we will all die. But we don't know what day it will be. And that is the worst thing in this world. If your grades are so bad, then drop out of university, go live and work in a factory in the countryside or join the JSDF. We don't have money to pay for university. It doesn't matter how fancy your house would be... We don't have money to pay for university. It doesn't matter how fancy your house would be... You'll end up in a coffin anyway. Even if you buy TAG Hauer, you can still tell time on your phone. Buying John Lobb won't satisfy me. Chanel, Harry Winston, all that fancy stuff, it's no more than self-indulgence. In the end it's just a brand. Iron, textile, fiber, cloth... No matter how much muscle you build, you still die human. No matter what fancy food you eat, in the end it all ends up in a drain. What the hell am I even living for? What is security like at night? Wait a minute... Security guards... Do you need more? Hey. People are starting to talk about us. With all the fuss they're making, I don't think we will be found out in the first place. - How about we destroy the new national stadium? - Nice idea. - Add it to the plan. - Plan? Destroying Tokyo on the Christmas night, to bring back the starry sky of this city. I called this plan... "MIDNIGHT MAIDEN WAR". Sky Tree, Roppongi Hills, Tokyo Metropolitan and so on... We will destroy everything and once again go back to Stone Age. Stone Age, huh... Yeah, you can't reset your life, but you can reset the world. And what about Tokyo Tower? We should destroy it too! Hey! He told you many times already that it would be an important monument to this civilization. People keep spreading criticism about us. Huh? People who struggle day by day, is it an evil that must be defeated? The hell is this? Good evening, Senpai. Good evening. So, you're still alive. Huh? Am I supposed to be dead? No, but I'm glad that you're alive. Only glad about me? What about you? I'm glad for both of us. That's not something you'd usually say. Senpai. Can we meet soon? What were you writing just now? I write down things that I can't control to forget about them. What if writing about it won't help you? In that case... Well, there's this nice bar where I usually go. - Welcome. Are you together? - Yes. - I'll have caprese and horse meat carpaccio. - Okay, carpaccio. - And you? - Ah... I'll have some pickles and dried tomatoes, I guess? Wait, did you hear what I ordered? They're all cold dishes. I'm sorry, we need more time to decide. - Oh, and two glasses of this. - Yes, mam. Honestly, I envy you, Senpai. Hm? I was just thinking how much fun it would have been, If I could live well just like Senpai. Don't tell me... You're trying to attract my affection? I met this old interviewer guy when I was job hunting, and I was very angry at him back then. He was just trying to make himself feel good and didn't really care about me as interviewee at all... But... I took advantage of it, and played the role of a obedient and innocent girl. And that's how you got the job offer, right? Still you know, it's not just about that old guy. Everyone else is the same. You want people to listen to what you have to say, but you don't care about what anyone else has to say. It's kinda funny. I accepted it too. I've been thinking about it for some time... No matter how angry you get, you can quickly blow off the steam. Laugh it off, fake it. That's why, I think I wasn't mad at that old guy... I was mad at myself. So, if you think that this kind of life is good, I'd like to get rid of it. What? Did I throw you off with my rambling? No, it's just kinda hard to tell my story. It's okay, don't worry, tell me everything. Well, Senpai... If I told you that I wanted to stop it, what would you do? What do you mean? That banner, it's your job, right? You... How did you find out about it? There is no doubt that If we leave it alone, it's gonna get extremely dangerous. It's not just Kana, all friends around me are falling victim one after another. What's wrong? Senpai, we must run. Huh? Wait! What's wrong? Senpai, please, don't get involved. There is no way you can compete with those people. Let's run! Hey... What the hell are you even fighting for? Hey... Are you okay? Hey, hey, are you okay? Hey... Are you okay? How's that? Having fun? That's so tacky. Honestly, I never cared about that woman. I've been keeping my eye on you, in case you get in trouble. You're very important to me, you know? That's why we knew everything. Sorry, man. And as a finishing touch, I brought all the stuff from that girl's room and recreated it. - Where is she? - Right here! Everything is here. Where is she? - Guys, go back to work. - Okay. Who do you think you are to mock someone who's working so hard to stay alive? We have no choice but to keep building on simple things that we know and understand. You have 1 message. You brought it up and now it is going to happen. I just wanted to give you a heads up. "Midnight Maiden War" will be put in motion tomorrow, on Christmas day. We are going to blow up Tokyo. It's impossible to stop it now. I doubt you'd even try, as you ran away already. See ya. Senpai... You should drink today, I've already had enough today. Are you safe? If you're not drunk, you haven't drank. If you haven't drank, then drink. I wanna see you get wasted. What will be your bet tonight? You'll get sick if you sleep here. Just right. Not for me. I said just right. The first girl who ever held my hand and played with me died in the earthquake. She was crushed right after changing schools. Come here too. Come on. Excuse me. Senpai, first I want to tell you... That Tokyo will be bombed tomorrow. Senpai, I want you to escape from this city by tomorrow night, please. I wanted to tell you that... I know full well that I'm in no position to face Senpai, but I came to meet you. I'm sorry. Seems like when you're drunk you also say strange things. If the city was destroyed right around the time we were born... It would have been absolutely horrible. But... Everyone is already in so much trouble, so nothing can be done. Everyone is sick... Has no money... That's why... Running away won't change a thing. Listen... What did you think of that song? - Fantastic. - Really? - Yeah. - Did you fall in love? Yes. Was I cute? You were beautiful. Fine, then I won't throw up. If you want to, do it. Sorry. Actually, tomorrow... No, today already... I had a date. I also promised to go to Odaiba the day after tomorrow. - Seems interesting. - Not at all. Listen... Can I ask you something? Go ahead. Do you like me? If I didn't, I wouldn't be here with you. Even if I have a boyfriend? That would be strange if Senpai had no lover. Oh, I see. You're the worst. That's what I like about you. Thank you. Actually, I... I didn't care if you had boyfriend or not. So, we're even. The worst? We're even? If you put it that way, yes. What if everything just repeated all over again? What're you gonna do? What do you mean? When you break up with someone, what if you go on a date with a complete stranger. You start exploring your feelings, have arguments, eat, miss last train, go to a hotel together. Same thing all over and over again. What would you do? Just like Yamanoto line, going round and round in circles all the time. Doing all this with you. Even though I like you, I like him too. But I don't arouse him sexually anymore. - Senpai, let's sleep. - I've dated some guys. And you? There were many people who only wanted one night stands. Did you enjoy it? It was fun at times, but I decided to forget about it once and for all. That's cool. Let's go to sleep. When I'm drunk I end up staying awake. When I met you in April... I... I was so happy. I was so lonely. I was trying to be right... You used to be like me. With that dubious look on your face... You appeared before me. This guy... I thought he didn't give up on anything yet. I absolutely wanted to make him happy. Right now... As we stay and talk here together, You're the only one I think about. But... Does it even have any meaning? I wonder, will it just repeat all over again? Senpai. What... What if... If there was a world... A world different from this one. And there... There are different kinds of us... And there, the world would stop once and with our power we would start thinking about our world, before it goes to pieces. If only we had such world... Tomorrow, Tokyo might not have blown up. Such future would have been nice... You said it would stop... I think the world won't be as kind as you think. Hey, will you... Will you be able to live without me? That's sad to say, but... I can live on my own. I'm glad. Me too. It's mutual love. I like you Senpai. Yeah. I love you. Wanna have sex? That's not what I meant. Then what? That's not what I meant at all. Well, then what are we? I think, we are two of a kind for sure. Nothing more, nothing less. My head's literally spinning... If Tokyo blows up tomorrow, would these feelings vanish with it? Let's sleep already. You should have some sleep too. Good night. Senpai was mumbling someone's name in sleep. But it wasn't my name. Merry Christmas. Glad you made it in time. Eternity that humans have created will vanish in a blink of an eye. Then the moment of our destruction will become eternity itself. This is what we all desired. And, of course, I desired it the most. The future that you've been dying for... Just think about it. Without me, you'd have been just another scum, shutting yourself away and talking to yourself all the time. I prepared a special seat for you. The ultimate illumination. Make sure to burn it into your memory. Perfect. I know. Just what I wanted. I know. But... There's nothing else you can do. You could say that. I'm grateful to you. Bravo! You won! But your victory is also mine. At least I'll be lying dead in a ditch with a pleasant look on my face. It's gonna be Christmas soon... Are you finally ready to finish our movie? The story is simple. The worst revenge tragedy in the history of Japanese cinema. Just think of it as an announcement before movie screening and ignore it. Life is short, fleeting and irrational. Since I was a kid, I always wanted to decide how I would die. I thought to myself, well If I'm gonna die eventually, I'd better accomplish everything interesting first, so I did a lot of things and learned a lot as a child, but it didn't feel right at all. However, unexpectedly, you provided me with that resolution. Thanks to my meeting with you, I came up with my best case scenario. An unknown young man who detests this world rises up and destroys everything. In turn becoming a god of the new world. I made my bets on you. I bet what was left of my life. And then you grew up. You've come this far. I am grateful to you too. Well... It seems like the movie is about to start. I'll bid you farewell, with the loveliest highlight of this century. Hey there. Senpai, where are you now? Where do you think? Huh? When you entered university, what was the most memorable thing to you? The place that you invited me to. And tonight, I will invite you there. Senpai. What? Will you please listen to me? I'll be quick. Sure. I want to talk to you right now. What happens to you in the near future... Yes? Is probably the worst thing that could ever happen to you. Yeah. Maybe Senpai's job offer will be revoked today or the day after... Yeah. The company who offered you the job, it might also get blown up. Yeah. But that's not all. University, that office... Everything will be gone. Yeah. And books will be gone too. They will erase libraries from this world. Yeah. Subway, Yamanoto line... All of them will stop working... Yeah. Also... I'll never forgive you... That I wasn't your true love. Yeah. I was trying to look cool back then... Sorry. Really... I was wondering whether you were the one... I was thinking about it... However... Still, thank you for believing in me. I don't think... Anyone will ever forgive you. Yes. I'll never forgive you either. It's an honor to me. I think I can die now. That's also what I intend to do. You're really the worst, you know that? But... If you're alive... Right now... It's all that matters to me.
