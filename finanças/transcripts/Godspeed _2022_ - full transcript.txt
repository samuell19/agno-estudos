Motherfuckers! Kerim, Hasan, the guy has a sniper rifle. Take him down! All right. Time to find the money. Sir. I've looked everywhere. Nothing. Where did she hide the cash? My guess is in the bedroom, but I'm not going in there. That's not cool. We're already running late. Don't you have a credit card or something? If I did, why would I be doing this? We can go now if you have one. I do, but I haven't made the minimum payments. You should set aside some money for a rainy day. Sir, I recommend, think like a woman. Where might Duygu put it? And he's giving me advice. Some fucking logic you have. Uh-huh! I knew you'd find it. I really did. I got it. Hang on. What's with the gun? How else will we stop the wedding? If you say so. Just don't shoot Elif. Like, by accident. Sir, we should probably go now, huh? Unbelievable! We're really doing this, huh? Gonna be honest. I never thought we'd actually do it. I didn't think we would be able to. But we are. You stepped on a line! You stepped on a line. My turn. Sir. Sir. Yeah. Come on. This one? Yes. One, two, three, four, five... Slow down. What? Sir, Dalyan is 430 miles from here. The wedding's tomorrow afternoon. Will this thing make it? - It must move like a snail. - Don't test me, Kerim. Just get in. What? It's been idle for months, man. This is normal. It'll work. I got this. Totally, of course. Mm-hmm. It broke. - Oh, snap. - Stop mocking me! - Now what? - We can't shut the engine off. Sir, what the hell are you doing? I'm just seeing if I can get the key to catch in. I'm not stupid, okay? What are you up to? I'm not up to anything. What am I doing? All right, Kerim. Come on, I'm pissed off. Let's just forget about it. Isn't there a spare key or something? The key is stuck inside there. Are you stupid? Where am I supposed to put the spare key? Just take it and put it wherever! It's your call. My God. Wow, man. Oh, wow. A sublieutenant telling his captain to "take it and put it there." - Really stuck. He's stuck. - Wow. With everything I've done for him. It's just like a broken record with this guy. Now look what the Army has become. Sir, please stop. The Army didn't have anything to do with this. And you had to take it there. Stop calling me "sir," all right? You've already ruined the Army for me. Just call me "brother." Lead the way then, brother. NETFLIX PRESENTS Miss Duygu, please stay calm. How can I be calm? - He ran away from the hospital? - You have to calm down. - Let's go to my office. - You even had someone standing guard. What is this? How could he just waltz out of here with all this security on patrol? Don't worry. We've alerted the civilian and military police. You had better find him soon. If he isn't safe and sound, you'll be in big trouble, Mr. Mahir. Don't do this. You couldn't keep an eye on a patient who's a suspect in an investigation. You'll have to explain that to the prosecutor yourself. Miss Duygu. It's a nice car, isn't it? You like it? Where'd you find it? Wanna buy it from me? What's the price? Go on, name your price. I don't know. It's worth 18,000, 20,000, right? Listen to you, you imbecile. You couldn't buy this steering wheel for that much money. It's a mint condition '74 model. If you find any scratches or stains, show 'em to me. Take a peek at that dashboard. I'll push this car off a cliff if you see a single scratch. I restored everything all by myself. All of it. I'll bet you can't guess how I got hubcaps for it. Tell me. I'll listen. Tell me how you got a hubcap. Stolen. Stole it, bro. You think finding parts for this car was easy for me? They're hard to locate. For ten years of my life, I rebuilt this car. You're a real birdbrain, 18,000 to 20,000. Idiot. The bastard's negotiating with me too. - Why? - Why what? Why put all that cash into this? You could have just bought an SUV with that amount. Well, my parents and my sister died in this car. You have to let go of the dead, man, and keep living your life. ACCEPT CALL Kerim. Hurry up. I left without saying anything. I'm almost done. Be patient. And then what happened? What did your mom say? She'll talk to him. She's just waiting for my dad to be in a good mood. Well, waiting for your father to be in a good mood is like waiting for a leap year. What are you getting at? Just that the leap year is every four years. Come on, Kerim. Your comedy really sucks. You just don't get my jokes. This time, my mom's gonna say that... Ow, that hurt! Be careful. All right, hold on. What's she gonna say? She's gonna tell him, "No matter what you say, I approve." - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. Hey. That's my future mother. Elif! - Dad! It's my dad. - I was wondering where you were. - Stupid me. Where else would you be? - Don't, Dad, please. - You're embarrassing us. - What are you doing here? - Hurry up, let's go. - It's not a big deal. Don't overreact. - Shut your mouth or you'll piss me off. - Mr. Davut, come on. Calm down. I heard you yelling, my hand slipped a little. It's just a small strand anyway. - Follow me and we'll discuss this at home. - Come on, all right. - I tell you not to see this asshole? - Mr. Davut! You didn't have to call me an asshole. - What the hell? - Is he insane? He's a maniac. Let's get out of here. Move it! I need cigarettes. You want anything? Banana milk. Banana milk. I knew you'd do that. Fuck! God give me patience. God give me patience. These animals are also the inspiration for Peru's red and white flag. - Hello. - Hi, welcome. Thanks to their wide webbed feet, flamingos can rest for hours by standing on one leg without losing their balance. - They stepped on a mine. - I'm sorry, sir. A pack of West and a banana milk. Although their name is phoenicopterus around the world, they are widely known as cranes in Turkey. They are widely seen in Sultan Reeds, Lakes Van and Tuz... Did you ever eat one? Ah! It's so tasty. After you're done plucking the feathers, you boil it. And then you shred it into pieces, serve it on a tray with rice. To make it extra juicy and delicious, broil it in the oven. A meal fit for a king. I can't wait for dinner. I'll take two airans as well. Oh, thanks for reminding me. My father-in-law's coming. I'll bring some for him. Bastard loves it. Stop, you asshole! Bring my dinner back! Son of a bitch! You escape from the hospital. You're wanted, and you steal a partridge from a convenience store. That asshole said he was gonna slaughter it just to feed the little thing to his father-in-law. - Nothing for the mother-in-law? - The animals should eat each other. He wanted it to broil it to bring the juices out of it. Asshole! You saying all this in front of the bird, huh? Kerim, I'll punch you so hard, you'll fly right out of this car. A bird must fly. It should roam free. They shouldn't have locked it up. Am I an animal, huh? - Captain, please calm down. - You locked me up here! Let go! Salih, you're overexcited. You're only making it worse. You'll hurt yourself. Why did you come, huh? Get the fuck out of here! It's not like you care about me. Get out, get out! - Salih, no need for this. - It's a simple injection. Please, don't make this any harder. We're trying to help you. Hey, are you listening to me? I'm telling you to leave. - Let go of me! - We're trying to help! - Get out, get out! Let go of me! - Calm down. Okay. Calm down. Let me go right now! Oh! - Are you okay, Mrs. Duygu? I'm so sorry. - You motherfucker! Sir, sir. - Mr. Salih, are you okay? - Let him go! Let him go now! Let him go! Leave! Salih! Salih! I'm okay, honey. I'm okay. Leave him alone now. Get out! He's okay. He's doing great. My sweetheart. My everything. I won't even be able to play six-a-side soccer anymore. Do you even have five friends? I won't be able to go fishing either. Just take a boat out. Back home in Kızılırmak, you can fish from the coast and keep changing where you cast from. A crane or two roams around. There'll be some catfish and some carp. Do you always fish by yourself? Usually. Does Duygu go with you? She used to come, but not anymore. She probably got sick of you. Maybe. She really loves you, man. You're right. I feel sorry for her. I'm guessing that Dugyu was the only friend you've had all your life. Am I right? Thanks a lot, man! Thank you. - Why am I going to all this trouble? - Maybe it's out of fear. You had no friends. Now you're half the man you were. Enough already! Now you've really crossed the line! No, that's enough, thank you. Well, Recep, what's this about, huh? It's good news, Mr. Davut. I mean, we're here for a good cause. Um, Elif. Baba, why don't you speak already? Okay, son. Hold on. Now, Davut. The kids talked about their future, and they're in agreement. I thought you already knew about it, but... - Anyway. - Mom. What? - You didn't tell him? - No, I haven't yet. I won't beat around the bush. With your blessing, our boy would like Elif's hand in marriage. That's enough, Recep. For the love of God, stop talking. Hey, Elif, get over here! Wait a minute now. Let's all calm down. Um, perhaps we should be civilized and ask Elif first. - Right, Elif? - Kerim. Look, are you testing my patience? - Okay, all right. Okay. Don't get angry. - Okay, what, Recep? How's it okay? You barge in here talking about marriage. Really? Are you all gonna drive me crazy? - Hey, Elif, come here, huh? - You told me they knew about this. Get over here. Get over here right now. Now I know what this is all about. You and I are gonna have a talk. - I thought Mom told you. - Not a word out of you. Now go! Out! - Why didn't you tell him, Mom? - I just couldn't tell him. - This isn't gonna work. - Okay, okay, okay, Davut. - Why didn't you tell him? - Right. This won't work. I'm gonna fix it right away. - I apologize for any inconvenience. - Wait a minute. What's going on, Dad? Mr. Davut, I... I'm not sure if I should call you "Dad" or not. I understand that there's been a misunderstanding, but it's okay. You've known me since middle school. Middle school, you know? And my intentions aren't to just hook up here. Trust in me. To hell with your intentions, you bastard! You dare talk about hooking up? Look, man, I'll beat you to a pulp. I will! - Davut, hold on. Hold on. - Oh, no. No, Mom! Get a hold of yourself. Okay, son, let's go. You come in here like this? Unbelievable! Tell him how happy we are, Elif. Tell him. We're in love. We're all family here. Please stop all this madness. Look what happened! Look! You made her cry. It was supposed to be our happiest day! Is this how we'll remember it? Why are you yelling?! I'm completely exhausted. Can you please... can you please just listen to me for once? - Just listen to me! You need to calm down. - Why should I be calming down? I should've at least given the flowers to her! All right? - Boy, are you crazy? - Get out! Forget about your flowers! So I'm guessing you stepped on a mine or something? I did, yes. Look, that's a sensitive subject. Don't turn it too hard. It'll come off. Gentle, all right? How did you walk with that leg? How could I walk? A helicopter took me. Maybe you should hold that with the pliers, right? Did they measure up your leg and attach it in a hospital? First, they do tons of operations on you. Then you have to wait for the swelling and the bruises to heal. They measure your leg. - Is it aluminum? - Hey, man, keep your hands to yourself! I can't tell the difference. It looks perfect. Look, you got the leather all dirty. This won't do. - What kind of social security do you have? - What? For your benefits, medical? Government retirement fund. Well, everyone should get social security now. - You remember the license plate? - 06 GCE 28. 06 GCE 28. I also have a photo on my phone. Look if you want. No need. That will do. Are you sure you don't need the photo? Honestly, no one will look at the photo, Duygu. It's an old Mercedes anyway. I'll report it first. That's all. Hüseyin, he's the subject of an investigation right now. They're not looking for him? He's a fugitive. That investigation is just standard procedure. Nothing will come of it. I'll be honest with you. No one will look unless he commits an offense of some kind. - That's that. - God forbid. I get it. I shouldn't get my hopes up then. Let's hope all goes well. - Okay, is there something else? - That's all. Thank you. You know that your father wants the best for you, Elif. I know it's a lot, my baby. Stop tormenting the woman. - Yes, Duygu. - Salih! Sweetheart, where are you? We're on the road. I know, Salih. Where are you? Where are you going? Please let me come with you. Duygu, please. You really can't do this with me. I promise. I won't bother you at all. I just wanna know where you're at and where you're headed, sweetie. I told you. We're on a road trip. It's just for fun. But who's "we"? What do you mean? You're with someone? Oh, thank God. Kerim's with me. We have something we need to take care of. Something might go wrong there, so you can't go. You... Kerim's going there with you? Yeah, why? Forget about it, Salih. Nothing. I'm really worried about you. Please don't worry about me. I gotta go now. Bye. Why did you tell her you were with me? - What's wrong with it? - It's better to leave me out of it. - Why would you even say that, huh? Idiot! - Salih, watch the road! We almost crashed. Close call, man. It just came out of nowhere. I haven't driven in such a long time. So, how long since you've been behind the wheel? Oh, man, a million-dollar car belonging to a couple of teenagers. Unreal. Oh, come on. It's not our business. - We're running late. - Look, Kerim, there's a girl there too. Somebody might harass them. This boy's not in his element. You guys need help? Hello. Thank you so much. Our car broke down. Thanks, but I got this. We don't need help. Let's put the pedal to the metal then, yeah? I have a rope to tow the car. Thanks, but the transmission's stuck. It won't work. I can get it towed, but I don't have any reception out here. This is a dead zone. I can drive you to the gas station. Great. The gas station's a great idea. I'm so over being stranded. What are you talking about? Where are you going? Just stay here. The reception's not getting any better here. You can keep trying to get a signal, but it's not working, all right? - God. Where do you think you're going? - Oh! Such a cute bird. Come on, damn it. - Come on, get in. - Get in. Orçun, come on. What's wrong? What's wrong? Just tell me, okay, before I lose my mind. Salih took off early this morning. - What do you mean? - He took the car and took off. I need to follow him, but I can't go alone. I need someone to come with me. Of course. Was he by himself? He was. Where you guys headed? We're going to Bodrum. - Vacation? - Uh-huh. No, uh, we have to work on our boat, and then we return. This car's pretty nice, really. Salih, I forgot to ask you on the phone. You took your gun. Please don't do anything. Call me right away. I'm so worried about you. There are cops up ahead. Shit. Uh, mister, can you please drop us off right here? That guy at the store called the cops. - Who calls cops for a partridge? - You hear about that girl? Drop us off! - You did steal that partridge. - Gimme the bag. - How could they be here that fast? - Can you pull over? - Because the technology is advanced now. - Can we please get out? - We didn't even do anything! - What's your problem? What's going on? Okay, we have weed in here, ounces and ounces! - Ounces of what? What? Weed? - Potato weed! Weed, weed! They have marijuana. Fuck! Step on it. Step on it! Nobody look. Don't look over there. Stay calm. Step on it. Come on, come on, come on. Step on it! We're gonna get in trouble. Come on. Turn onto the forest road. I'm not putting my car on some dirt road. Pull over! - Gonna get arrested by the police. - Take the forest road. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Let go of the steering wheel! Fuck! They're looking for us, and now we have marijuana in the car. I'm scared, all right? What are you, stupid or something? How could you make a heart with our boats in the middle of the canal for a photo? You're gonna do something for Elif on Instagram, I bet. - Tag. - Tag! Yeah, I'll give you a tag. The chairman of the cooperative forgave it. The chairman may have forgiven you, but what about those guys whose boats you took apart? - You did damage to two of our boats. - I'll pay for it. With what money? He forgave you, but fired you from the cooperative. You don't even have a job. How are you gonna pay for anything, smart guy? Did you headbutt someone yesterday? I hear the guy is Elif's classmate. Can't the girl speak to anyone? Are you a psychopath, Kerim? Hakan, please, I... I saw him holding her. He had his arms wrapped around her, and I'm... I swear, I'll punch you through that wall! Are you a maniac or something? There's a right way to approach everything. Dear Lord. Well, I can't really think of any better way to do it, Hakan. Listen, if you keep up these stunts, do you think it'll change Davut's mind about you? Think about that. Why would he let you marry his daughter, huh? You haven't done your military service yet. He doesn't approve because I haven't completed the military? Of course. Never let a man marry your daughter till his service is complete. Finish your military service career. No problem. Whoa, hold on. You can't leave yet. Sign the bottom. You're seeing the prosecutor tomorrow. This is the complaint of the guy you headbutted. Okay, I'm calling the head of the recruitment office now. Promise you'll go and complete your enlistment, okay? - I'm on my way. - Hurry up then. Have a good day, Bekir. - Say hi to your father. - I will. What happened? Did they do anything? Don't worry. The guy filed a complaint. I'll go to the prosecutor tomorrow. Kerim, why are you being like this? And I'm enlisting in the military. - Come with me to the recruitment office. - Huh? - I have to go to the recruitment office. - What do you mean the military? Fuck off! Get the fuck out! - Orçun! - Fuck you! You're doing drugs, and you have the audacity to whine about your parents? God damn it, wait for me! I hope they didn't leave any weed in the car. Look what happened to my car. - Let's get going. - Look at my car. Let's go! The hubcap's gone. Fuck. My hubcap's missing. It must've fallen off. We're gonna go look for it. Salih, don't. I'll get you a new hubcap. The police and the military are looking for you. We're already late. We can't be arrested. Just go, all right? Watch it. I'll get you that hubcap. Let's go. Let's go. This is bullshit. - Aww, this is bullshit. - This is some hubcap shit. Fuck this shit. We're totally fucked! I can see the headline. "The veteran captain turns out to be a dealer." How would you get out of that one, huh? You know, when you're this arrogant and smug, I just wanna punch your teeth out. And all that because of this bird. Wait, what did the bird do? So, you think if you set it free into nature, it's gonna live its life to the fullest, huh? Better than if he was in that store. Here's to your freedom. They shot the bird. - You motherfuckers! - It must be here somewhere. You dirty motherfuckers! How fucking dare you! Hey, brother. They've got guns. Calm down! Fuckers! All right, let's go. Get out of here. Come on, let's go. You motherfuckers. You motherfuckers. Let it go. It's dead. Let's go. Come on. Hold up, what are you doing? Uh, hello, there. God damn it. What did you want from this little bird? Uh, we have our documents and certificates. Uh, we're hunting. So you're a murderer with a certificate. Who are you calling murderer? - Who are you, huh? - Let's go. The partridge belonged to him. Belonged to him? Are you flying your pet partridge here? Are you fucking with us? Give us the bird. How about I hit you so hard your jaw flies off? He's probably military police. Please forgive us. He has a handgun. Let's go. I'm sorry about that, man. It was an accident. There's plenty of other partridges. - Hey! - Come on, let's go. We're running late. Come on. I hope that's your last hunt. Just shoot a can or a board. I don't know. Shoot a rock or something! Hell, don't shoot anything if you can help it! Just stop with all the gun shit. What are you going to do if he holds a gun to your head in the middle of the night? What are you going to do, Duygu? Have you thought of that? Look at the state of the man. Well, say something. How much time did you even spend together after you got married? Think about that. For the love of God! I can't believe you didn't talk to us before marrying him. He's a soldier. We said he couldn't give you a stable life, but you didn't listen! He was always in the Southeast while you were here. Was he dead, alive? I've spent how many years worrying and not a single update. We can't sleep. Everything's a wreck! And with these latest episodes, how will you manage if he goes to jail, huh? Honey, this marriage has been over for a long time. You have to accept it. Are you going to waste away in courthouses for the rest of your life with a one-legged lunatic? Aren't your mother and I your family? My family is in there. Do you understand me? I won't leave Salih, even if it kills me. Get out of my house. Right now! Get out! It's so beautiful. So beautiful. - So what's up with you? - What's that? You escaped the hospital and dodged security. Stole the partridge, the police were after us, and you helped those potheads. You released the bird and then got it killed. On top of that, you stole a hubcap. That won't do. Maybe your intentions are good, but it won't work like that. Do you think the cops have stopped looking? Of course, but we still need to be careful. Right. Let's find a hotel for the night. We did enough driving today. Let's do that. - Hmm, do you know Muammer? - Mesut's son? - Yeah. - Works at the recruitment office. Yeah, he said I could join the Marines. Because I'm a child of the sea. Then why did Akif go to the Southeast? His family are all seamen. They run a shipyard. I'm just telling you what the guy said. Kerim, should we pull some strings perhaps? How would we do that? Plus, the head of the office told me not to do that. That it backfires. There's nothing to do. It'll be worth it if your father says yes. Don't worry. I'll persuade my Dad. How's that? Hmm. I'll cry and whine to him. My dad's okay. He's actually a softie. Hmm. Yeah, right. Softie. Your softie of a father went after me with the handle of a pickaxe. What was he supposed to do? You hung a huge banner saying "Elif and Kerim" in the square. Right in front of the store. Why are you laughing? He was embarrassed. You don't get it. I'm doing all of this for a reason. To show him you're crazy, huh? For years, you didn't realize how I felt until I told you. Your father doesn't understand me, huh? I want the entire world to know. You will be wearing a wedding dress in front of me. - Oh, I have something for you. - What? - I should have got you something. - That's okay. Just open it. Oh, my... You kept it? Of course I kept it, sweetie. Ow, Kerim! Oh! FOUR SOLDIERS WERE MARTYRED IN THE VICINITY OF YEŞİLLİ VILLAGE. The oven's still on. Do you want me to cook that? Do you have rust remover? What's that? Rust remover, the oil or spray. - Have any? - What are you gonna do with it? Drink that too? What are you doing? - You're obsessed with that thing. - Stop talking. We're staying at the hotel upstairs. You can just bring us the rust remover later tonight, to the room. Should I top your drink off? Sounds good. - Not a good idea. - Pour some more. - It's not really the best... - Pour some more. - Do you need anything else? - That's all. Should I change the song? ♪ Promise you I'll keep it to myself... ♪ Salih, I asked if I should change the song. ♪ Promise you I'll keep it to myself ♪ ♪ Show me all the shadows you have seen... ♪ I really missed you, Salih. ♪ Take me to the place Where you have been ♪ ♪ I see you ♪ ♪ You're my love... ♪ ♪ I see you ♪ ♪ Please let me in... ♪ ♪ Promise you I'll keep it to myself ♪ ♪ Show me all the shadows you have seen ♪ ♪ Take me to the place Where you have been... ♪ Salih. ♪ Show me all the shadows you have seen ♪ ♪ Take me to the place Where you have been ♪ ♪ I see you ♪ ♪ I see you ♪ ♪ You're my love... ♪ ♪ I see you... ♪ ♪ I see you ♪ ♪ You're my love ♪ ♪ I see you... ♪ ♪ Oh, please, let me in ♪ There we go. You can go fuck yourself, you stupid son of a bitch. Here, let me carry that. You really loved her. Everyone knew about it. But he made her marry someone else. That son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. How can he do this to me? I'm such a handsome guy. "Handsome." That son of a bitch! Huh? We're coming! We're coming. What'll he do? Nothing, man. I'm sure he won't do anything. Let's just go get Elif. What do you think that bastard of a father is gonna say when he sees you, huh? I don't know. I do. He's gonna apologize. And I'm gonna make him. Of course you will. Let's go. No matter what you say, I am gonna stop that wedding. - And we're gonna get that girl. - We are, yeah. I can't believe... Why would Elif accept it, huh? I told Elif. I told her it's unacceptable. You and Elif spoke to each other? Of course we did. How else would I have known about the wedding? Plus, wasn't she the one saying she was never gonna leave you? We're gonna stop that wedding. We're gonna get that girl back. The greatest soldier ever is coming! The greatest soldier ever is coming! The greatest soldier ever is coming! The greatest soldier ever is coming! The greatest soldier ever is coming! Some say the climate in the city is harder. It's never true. The greatest soldier ever is coming! The greatest soldier ever... - How did you sneak out? - Don't worry about me. Oh! Look what I got you. But I don't smoke. I know. I thought that maybe you could light a cigarette for your commander, and he'll like you right away. I don't know. Kerim, I have to tell you something. Yeah, tell me. I really don't care what happens. I love you so much, and I'll be here waiting, no matter what. Just don't forget about me. Hmm? I promise I won't. I won't. I'll call first chance I get. Stop. Kerim! Sweetheart. Have a good trip. Is it Duygu? Have you seen my other sock? Hmm. Why do you bother changing this? Is it needed for the prosthesis? Last night you took it off, dumbass. - Here, put it on. - I'm putting it on. It doesn't smell. Don't ever wash it. Push. Okay, okay, it's good. All right, put it on. Well done. Seems like you're used to it. How's it look? You can't tell when I'm walking, right? I'm glad it was my left foot on the mine. Why? Something my mom said, "Start with your right foot forward and everything will go well." I don't think that worked out too well for you. When a sulfur explosion happens under the ocean water, the water turns a greenish yellow color. It's a truly beautiful thing to behold. Especially in the morning, when there's a fog over the water. That's when Kerimoğlu and I head out to sea. You can glide effortlessly through the narrow reeds. You know how far İztuzu Beach is from Dalyan? It's about 40 minutes. You go slowly. You have to be careful not to disturb the fish and the sea turtles. Motorboats aren't allowed there. You understand what peace means there. There's all sorts of birds around. What the hell? How the fuck did we run out of gas? With all your yapping, I forgot to check. Seriously? You're driving, and it's somehow my fault still? You're thick as a brick. Didn't you keep an eye on it? I'm supposed to watch the dashboard in front of you? Are you insane? What happens now? We're stranded. Was there a gas station nearby? - Did you see one earlier? - Not my problem. You motherfucker. You're useless. Remember, I said not to take this car. Stop scratching your back. It's gonna bleed. Look at the situation I'm in. Wish I never met you. INFANTRY CAPTAIN Come in. Sublieutenant Kerim Kerimoğlu. - Did you turn off the lights? - No, sir. The power went out. What do you want? The battalion commander sent me to your troop, sir. Right. Come on in then. Oh, God. I'm sorry, sir. - Are you cursed or something? - I don't think so, sir. My father had one of these. Do they still sell them? Yes, they do, Captain. So tell me about yourself. Who are you? Your family, your school? Yes, sir. Come in. Clear those pieces of broken glass on the floor. Yes, sir. Well, Kerimoğlu. I'm from Muğla, Köyceğiz, sir. I studied tourism and hotel management. I live in Dalyan, where I give tours of the bay to the visiting tourists. - Are you married? - No, sir. Good. Good. Married soldiers are a problem. They get too worried about their wives. After my service, I'm getting married. Do you know how to play hopscotch, Kerimoğlu? Excuse me, sir. I asked if you know how to play hopscotch. You know, stand on one leg. And you don't step on the lines. Are you talking about the game that little girls play, sir? Only harder. Carrying 90 pounds. For days. There are mines everywhere. You need to learn to play hopscotch right away. I understand, Captain. You can kill a man, right? You're dismissed. Sir. Look at that. Without a doubt, you're cursed. NEVER CALL THOSE MARTYRED IN THE CAUSE OF ALLAH "DEAD." So much more goes into polishing shoes than you would think. You need to soak the leather really well. The sponge is important. People use those polished sponges. I hate it. If I were the chief of the staff, I would ban all those sponges. The brush is also important. It has to be horsehair. From its tail. It can't be pig's hair. Tell me, Kerimoğlu. Why can't it be pig's hair? Because it's a sin or something? What are you even saying? Pig's hair is tough. It scratches the leather. Polishing can become artistic. Okay, where else is horsehair used? - How should I know? - Use your head, huh? Violins. The bows of violins are made from actual horsehair. Ah, I see, man. The same hair is used, and it comes from the horse, and since it's from the ass of the same horse, then shoe polishing is artistic. Why did... That's it. What the hell is your problem? Run, come on! Get down! Akın Headquarters. Cease fire! It's us! It's us! Rush Vineyard, cease fire! Rush Vineyard, cease fire! I want an incident report. Check if there are any casualties. I'm gonna send all of you for court-martial. - You're gonna be held responsible. - Sir. You were firing at us! - Sir, wait. I'll deal with it. - You were firing at us! I'll deal with it, sir. Soldier, at what range do you open fire? Sixty-five to 85 feet, sir. You're shooting from 65 to 85 feet. There are 50 men out there! You don't hit any of them, and you go and hit my pocketknife, huh? Huh? You're some shot! Sir, this knife was a custom-made. Do you have any idea how much I spent? Now explain this to me, explain it! Explain yourself, man. Unbelievable. - Should we go back and look for it? - No, don't worry about it, sir. Yeah, you think, Kerimoğlu? For the love of God, get moving. - I'm hungry as hell. - Yeah, I'm hungry too. You're really... You're really a strange man. Come on, let's go. Hello. How can I help you? Our car got stranded. - Can you fill this up? - Okay. I assume you have an official document. What document? You need a document, or I can't fill you up. Such a dumbass. - Why? - It's the law, sir. You could burn the forest down or something. Please, sir. Take a look at me. Do I look like an arsonist? - How should I know? - Are you an idiot? Don't get involved. Listen, I've been walking with this prosthetic leg for half an hour. I'm a former military captain. If you don't believe me, there, here's my card. And my friend here is a lieutenant. It doesn't matter if you're a captain. - I can't. I'm sorry, man. - Is this a fucking joke? - Hey, don't hurt me! - Fuck you and your fucking document. - You fucking piece of shit! - Help! - Fuck you! You motherfucker! - Get off me! Get off me! - You fucking piece of shit! - Let him go! Let him go! Break it up! The person you've called cannot be reached at the moment. Please try again later. Come on. He's not gonna pick up. Hooligan. He's gone too far this time. I get it. It's really hard for you. But it's the fact that he's tormenting you so much. He doesn't know. If he knew, he... He knows. What makes you think otherwise? As if this is easy for you. It's not as hard as it looks. What does that mean? The hard part was when he was on deployment. You're always looking at the phone or the door, expecting the worst. - I understand. - You don't understand. I was relieved, Papa. You know what? It made me happy. I said, "Thank God for this because he's hurt." "They only injured him." "The worst part of it is over now. Behind us." He lost half of him, and I celebrate. Who could blame you for thinking like that? I found out I'm pregnant, Papa. You dropped this when you were roughing up our stupid boy. Your veteran card. You mean free traveling card. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't catch that. It says "Free Traveling Card" on it. What being a veteran really means here. That's all it's worth. That's enough for me. I'm just blabbering. I hear you, sir. I got you covered. You could've just called. You shouldn't have walked all that way in this heat. No worries. It was good exercise. - Mr. Gaffur. - What's the problem? Someone punctured the captain's fuel tank. My God, take care of it right away. Who could have done such a thing? Don't worry, sir. Our guys will take care of it right away. You don't have much further to drive. I doubt this rattles you anyway. You had to have dealt with so much worse on those mountains. This must be nothing. Even though it seems that way. It's really not like that. What do you mean it's not like that? I mean, of course it's not, but you know what I mean. One time... we were traveling in a convoy of four or five vehicles, right? It was a calm day. We heard a rumble. It sounded like a small explosion. Tire on our vehicle blew. And this is a truck I'm talking about. I was tasked with informing the other soldiers with me right away. But... I froze. I was overcome with shock. The other soldiers with me were waiting for me to give them orders. I just sat there in silence for a while. It was like I just blacked out. Then someone opened my door, grabbed me and pulled me out. It was sublieutenant Kerim. He ran over from the vehicle behind us. Then he started shaking me to get me to come to. That didn't work. He notified the others on the radio. "I'm with the captain and reporting, sir." "We're securing the convoy and checking the perimeter and changing the tire of the vehicle, commander." And I woke up. See, out in the field, you're always ready for engagement. But at that moment, right then I realized I never thought about what I'd do if a tire blew out. What I mean is... I knew I could die... but if I live, what happens? That's what you think. Are those ranks on your shoulder bird shit? Didn't I tell you not to be so informal with these sublieutenants? Did I or did I not tell you? If you wipe your ass with a grain of sand, you end up holding shit, Captain. Captain Salih is not to blame here, sir. What did you just say, shit? Did anyone ask you? Get the fuck out of here! Take your statements from the staff officer. Write them and deliver them directly to me by the evening. Both of you. I'm kicking out that piece of work sublieutenant. - Tell him to pack his stuff. - Yes, sir. Staff Major Hayrettin Uzun. - Colonel Şevket. - Yes, sir. Speaking, sir. Hayrettin, do you remember me, right? From the General Staff. Of course, sir. How can I help you? Been trying to get a hold of Captain Salih. He's here, sir. We were discussing the details of tomorrow's operation. Oh, good, good. He's related to me. Put him the phone. Copy that, sir. Right away, sir. Captain Salih. How can I help, sir? Commander, this is Colonel Şevket. I understand, sir. Of course, sir. Understood, sir. I'll handle myself, sir. Please give my respects to the commander as well, sir. Thank you, sir. Salih, what did Colonel Şevket say? Well, sir... KÖYCEĞİZ 2017 CALENDAR A relative of our chief of staff has a wedding in Köyceğiz. That's why he called. Why did they call you then? If he called the military police or the central command there, Muğla would have handled it. It makes no sense. Sir, it's private. We're distant relatives, so Colonel Şevket, he said it's a secret. Very well, understood. So, how are we gonna do this? The shit, sublieutenant Kerim. He's from Köyceğiz. I'll send him over there for a few days. He'll handle it. Leave it to me. It smells like oranges. What's going on? That's enough. Get out. Get out! - What's going on? - That's enough. Enough with the scratching. I'm gonna take a look at it. Hey, look, this is my hometown. If someone sees... I looked, and there's nothing there. It's just psychological. Psychological. I miss Elif so much, sir. And the smell of oranges. I even miss taking my boat out in Dalyan and then sailing all day through the reeds. You won't be here long. You're going back after this operation. For a very important mission. Colonel Şevket told me there's a very important mission in Köyceğiz. It might take you a few days. I guess you'll get to see Elif. I'm ready for any type of mission, sir. The wave of folk songs continues with an Aegean vibe. Here to sing the "Kerimoğlu Zeybeği," Sümer Ezgü. Ah! Mustafa, turn this one up! I'll be doing this dance at my wedding, sir. If I could just see you in that wedding dress. Fuck! Motherfuckers! Kerim, Hasan! The guy has a sniper rifle. Take him out! Son of a bitch! Take him down! Elif, what's wrong? That's enough entertainment. Enough. I got him! I got him, sir! Kerim, hold up! Hold up! Everybody hold their position. They're not alone. The others must be close by. Be careful! Akın 1, headquarters. We heard gunshots from your area. Are you in contact? Akın headquarters, Akın 10. Correct. The wedding activity just began. Don't! Stay calm! Don't come any closer. Just stay back. - Get back! - Wait! - Everybody back to their seats! - Don't shoot! - Commander! - Davut. Don't. Just lower your gun. - Are you Elif's father? - I am. The wedding had to be today? - Any day is better than this. - We didn't know, sir. We wouldn't have done it. She was gonna kill herself. I got so scared to look into her room every morning. What else was I supposed to do, huh? Am I supposed to let her kill herself? - Shut up! Shut up! - Please don't! Elif, I came to take you to Kerim. Everybody just leave! The wedding's over! What was her part in this? She's innocent. Don't get involved, woman, or I'll shoot all of you. Trust me! Keep away. Don't move. - Seriously, just stay back. - Leave him alone. Don't come any closer. We're leaving. Don't come any closer. Don't come any closer. Just stay back. Don't try me. Okay, okay! That's enough. That's enough! Stop. Don't. I'll help you. Come on. Elif, wait. Wait. My prosthetic has come off. Okay, I'll help you. Will you stay back! Like this. Does it hurt? So sad. I hope you enjoy the party. It's time. Come on. It's all because of you. Ammo. I can't do it, sir. I get bored just standing around. Well, if you don't know how to fish, you'll just wait around like a fool. Come to Dalyan to fish one day. I'll take you out fishing with good old Kerimoğlu. One day we'll do it, God willing. I want you to take two men, go get the guy you shot. Get the other guys to do it, Captain. Third lieutenant, get it together! Understood, Captain! Ahmet, Mustafa. Be careful. Keep your radios on. Sir, yes, sir! - Hikmet. - Yes, sir. - Gimme that. - Here it is, sir. Kerimoğlu, what is there? What kind of fish? Some guys catch bream from the shore. Sometimes we go out for corals. What bait do they use? Krill. Just small shrimp. I can get away for two days with an annual leave. Let's make plans. Of course, sir. Gladly. Tell the guys behind you to pick up the pace. Oh, shit. I didn't wanna marry him. - But he wouldn't listen. - Silence! I said I was deeply in love. Too deep in love. But nobody listened. Right now, shut your mouth! - That's enough. - You too. Shut your mouth! Look at me. Look at me. Look at what you made me do! And I'll tear the head off of that thing if you don't shut that partridge up! Have you seen this car anywhere? Oh! Salih! Salih! - Dad! - Salih, Salih, stop! You are going to crash. Haven't you caused enough accidents, Captain? No one asked me anything. I was gonna kill myself anyway. They arranged the wedding date so quickly. Today was a coincidence. No one knew. They couldn't have. So, how did your father and mother and sister die in this car? Do you remember? That's enough! The school's commander told them to come because of your grades. It was for you. You said to get the girl, Kerim. You should pull over. Admit it. Kerim. Kerim. Kerim. Elif... Call Elif for me, sir. Back to your position! Quick march! Right turn! Left turn! Attention! Arm down! Lockstep, march! Salute! Hey, Commander. Salih! Salih! Salih! Salih. Salih. I'm going to hug you now. And I'm going to take that gun. Let's leave together. Let's go home. Please, Salih. I'm not ever going to leave you. Know that. Make your choice knowing that. Let go of the dead, Salih. You know that you have to keep living. Let me go. I'll go with him. He'll never be gone, Salih. Look. He's right here. Kerim, what are you up to? I'm good, Mr. Ahmet. How are you? - Come here. I'll take you crab hunting. - No, I don't want to. - Ahmet, stop scaring the kid. - Okay. - Have a good one. - Thanks. Kerim, son, get me some water, hmm? Don't be scared. If you really want to, I can show you how to catch a crab. - Okay. - It's simple. You take a chicken leg or the head of a fish on the hook, and the crab will grab onto it and crawl up. We'll scoop it in our net and put it in our bucket. So it's impossible for it to get you. Should we try it tomorrow? Let's do it. Let's do it today! But we don't have any gear. I promise we'll do it. We'll do it tomorrow. Thirty-two Turkish Armed Forces soldiers have been martyred Dedicated to all our martyrs and veterans...
