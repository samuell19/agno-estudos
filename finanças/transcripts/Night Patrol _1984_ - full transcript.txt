I was all around the club, but then I had to come out here and patrol also. Melvin, do you think that maybe the Unknown Comic and the bag man are maybe one and the same? No, in fact I'm sure they're not because I had a long talk with the Unknown Comic before his show and he can account for every one of his whereabouts during the time of the robberies. Oh, good! Melvin, I was gonna have a cup of coffee. You want to maybe come with me? I'd love to Sue, but it's a, I'm still on duty and I have to find Kent, but sometime we'll get together, me and you and we'll do our laundry, okay? Okay. Alright, I'll see ya. Bye, Melvin. Bye!

So you were a big hit at the Comedy and Magic club? Now your manager has so many things happening, you can give up your job. You're gonna make a pile of money. And you'll move into Beverly Hills. Anyplace is better than the back seat of my car. It wasn't that great. Edith didn't show. And you'll never guess what happened. You found out Edith's allergic to paper. No, after the show we got this call to investigate a peeping tom. Hubba, hubba, hubba. So we snuck up on the culprit and beat the crap out of the fat slob. You see, us police are expertly trained in kung fu. Hee ya! Anything you say can and will be held against you. Liz Taylor, Michael Jackson, Richard Simmons. Shit! How about Boy George? Go check on the girl. I'll take care of this guy. Are you really the police? Yes, I am. Okay, but you just can't be too sure. Edith! Well, how did you know my name is Edith? We never met before. You see, my sister's name is Edith and you reminded me of her. You have no idea how terrified I was. It was awful! He just kept staring at me through that window. This window here. Yes. Did he see anything? He saw everything. Can you describe exactly what happened? Well, I was getting ready for bed. I was really tired. I started to take off my bathrobe. And then I took my stockings off. And then I remembered I couldn't wait to get my bra off. Oh, feels so good! God, I have nice tits! Then I got up to take these off. That's when I noticed him, that pervert! Staring at me through the window with those binoculars. Yeah, well what did he do next? I mean can you identify these here as being the binoculars that the pervert was using? Yeah, I'm sure. Okay. Fine. God, it makes me so angry! Well, you're beautiful when you're angry. God, I don't understand you men. It just makes me want to puke! What kind of men do you like? Are you getting this down? Well, I'm dating a nightclub owner. His name is Tex. Tex? You're dating Tex? You know Tex? No, my brother's name is Tex. Well, he's a nice guy. He buys nice things, takes me nice places. Do you know who I'm really mad about? No, who? The Unknown Comic. He's hot! He makes me horny because he's gonna be rich. Does he like you? Of course he does, who wouldn't? And as soon as I can figure out what to do with Tex, The Unknown Comic will be all mine! Well, does Tex know that you know The Unknown Comic? Sure, he does. He even bet me a diamond bracelet I couldn't find out what was under that bag. But I'm gonna find out what's under that bag and that bag, no matter what I have to do. Let go of me! I'm gonna kick you in the balls! Who do you think you're dealing with? Let go of me! I want a lawyer! I want him now! I've got rights! You don't know who I am! Hey, great buns! I'll file a report. You book the pervert. Alright, Kent. Hey, Melvin, what are you bringing him in for? 409. Shame on you, peeking through windows like that! See anything good? I've seen better. You wouldn't believe what this slime did. Stabbed his own mother with a BBQ fork. Then I tried to put the cuffs on him, he socks me. So I booked him on a 504 and a 316. What's that? Cop socking and mother forking. Hey, Margowitz, what are you bringing your guy in for? 604. What's that? Armed robbery. Geez. Randy, got another cat burglar, huh? Stop or I'll shoot! Why do they keep my shoelaces? Common procedure when you're booked. We don't want anyone hanging themselves. You're not going to put me in a cell with one of those hardened and dangerous criminals are you? Don't worry about that. We'll find you a safe cell. Hey, what are you in here for? Just because I killed myself aberrant, a degenerate! I killed three of them before they cut me. I got one and I broke his fingers and squashed his head in a vice. And the second one, I got a three pound chicken and I stuffed it in his... When I get out of here, I'm gonna do something! Maybe we better find you another cell. Why? I like him, he was nice. Alright, you guys, this here's a peeping tom. Any of you guys object to that sort of a crime? Hell, no. Looks like you needed the excitement, huh? See. Yeah, they got me in here for having sex with a girl under 18. There's nothing wrong with that. Is there guys? No, there's nothing like a couple of thirteen year olds to play with. I'm in here for exposing myself in the park. There's nothing wrong with that, is there fellas? Hell, no. You were just giving them a treat. Sounds like fun to me. They got me here for doing porno films. Now, ya'll would like to do porno films wouldn't ya? We'd all like to be free enough to do porno films. Can I get his autograph? As long as you're all letting it hang out, when I was a kid I'd go to the fields, you know, and I'd make it with a sheep. Aw, man that's sick! I guess everybody's done that at one time or another, right? Just get out, man! Get out of here! I booked you in Vegas a week from Friday. Vegas? Well, that's great, Kate! But wait, I still have two weeks left on my police job. Now, I booked you on your day off. It's just a one night gig. You know, they want to see how you do in the big room. They're not sure a guy with a bag over his head can pull it off. What do you think? You think we can pull it off? Pull it off? I've hired a choreographer, conductor, singers, dancers, everything, I mean this is the big time! This is great! This is too good to be true! Thanks, Kate. Bye! Bye, kid! Melvin, is it true? Is what true? Captain Lewis got a phone call earlier linking you with the bag man! I overheard him saying he was gonna inspect your locker. So I rushed over there first. Melvin, I found over 50 paper bags! I put them in my desk. Well, that's what happened to them! You know, I was wondering what happened to those bags. See, I've been collecting those bags as evidence against the bag man. I am this close to breaking that case. I know you're such a good person. You wouldn't hurt a fly. Well, you're a good person. Of course I am and you've got good instincts. You gotta believe in them. 'Cause I am a good person. I am honest. I believe you. You're a good guy, Sue. Sometime we oughta go somewhere and just have some fun. Yeah? Yeah, maybe we could go to my apartment and vacuum it. Oh, that sounds great! Yeah. Hey listen, next week is my birthday and I heard that the Unknown Comic is going to be playing in Las Vegas so as a treat to myself I was gonna go down there and being that I make out your schedule, I know you're not working next Friday so maybe you'd like to join me? No, you see I couldn't. To tell you the truth, I'm sort of seeing someone else. She's a knockout too. Her name is Edith. She's got long, blond hair, you know and sometime maybe the three of us we can go bowling. Who am I kidding? She's not the bowling type. She's not a buddy like you are. We'll get together sometime soon. We'll go out somewhere just the three of us, okay? I'll see ya later. Yes, I'm tense. Of course I'm tense. Tonight's my big night in Vegas. I hope that bag man doesn't rob another bar. Everybody thinks it's me. I'm not even sure it's not me! Do you think it's me? Do you think I'm crazy? Am I schizophrenic? Help me, Doc, you gotta help me! What do you think? I think we came over on different ships, but we're in the same boat now. I don't understand, Doc. Never mind. Have a great time in Vegas. It's a great marquis, Kate. I don't believe it. They forgot my name. You have me to thank for everything. Oh, and don't forget the party in the suite tomorrow. Yeah, but where's my name? I don't see my name up there. Where's my name? Ladies and gentlemen, The Unknown Comic. Alright! Keep that applause going for the bagettes, ladies and gentlemen! My first night in Las Vegas. Already I got 14 girls in the sack with me, right? I'd like to introduce my parents in the audience. All the way from Sacramento, Mr. And Mrs. Bagovich. Ma and Pa Bagovich! And also in the audience, they just flew in all the way from Baghdad, my grandparents, Grandma and Grandpa. Stand up and take a bow. There they are, ladies and gentlemen. Grandma and Grandpa! You don't know me, do you? That's why I carry this. That's right, my American Express card. Gets me into any restaurant in the country. I just go at three in the morning after they've closed and stick it in between the door and the lock. How are the new dolls? Terrific, absolutely terrific! There he is. You're funny. Oh, thanks bud. We had a meeting with the board of directors this morning and I'd like to offer you a contract with the hotel. You know it all started when I was a little kid. I always wanted to be funny. You're not making my job any easier! Why don't you go talk to the press people and I'll explain to Mr. Egglash you're booked solid and you need a lot of money. Alright, nice meeting you Mister. Yes, it was nice to meet you. You too, bye-bye. Can I get an interview here? Just one minute. You have any money on you? Do you have any plans to do a movie? Yeah, I'd love to do a porno movie. Hello. Edith! Well, I thought your show was dynamite last night. I want you to know, I know about you and Tex. Well, then I guess I better tell you, you see Tex is in deep shit with the IRS. He feels you're the only one that can help him. He wants you to do a benefit performance at the club. Yeah? Why don't you take that bag off when I'm talking to you? Anyway, I've been waiting so long for you and I to be together, haven't you? Aren't you worried Tex will find out about us? Well, he never found out about the others. Mmm, oh shit! Goddamn fucking glass! My dress is all wet! Give me a hand here will ya before I rip your sack off! No. Make me want to puke! Excuse me, Mr. Unknown Comic, I saw your show last night. It was really terrific. Could I get your autograph? Of course. Excuse me, you're interrupting us! Why don't you take your tits and ass and get lost! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt anything. It's okay, she's just a fan. Hey! I thought we had something going here until this dumb bitch showed up. Uh-oh. You can talk about my tits and you can talk about my ass, but don't ever call me dumb! I hope you can swim. I apologize! You should be a stunt woman. I'll save you? Get the fuck out of here! You really showed her. I love that dress you're wearing. Oh, that's nice. I never knew you had such big tits. Well, I think you're really terrific, but I have a boyfriend, although, he doesn't seem to know I exist. What an idiot this guy must be. His name is Melvin and by the way I'm Sue. Do you think you can make that out to both of us, Melvin and Sue? Melvin and Sue. I hope that you're not mad at me and I'm really sorry about your girlfriend. Oh no, it's alright. Oh, Edith... Edith! Do me a favor and set up a benefit performance at Tex's comedy club? Alright, alright! But I want to tell you something. The bag man just committed another robbery and you're the prime suspect! That's right! You sure are Bag Face! But I assured the Captain that you were with me during the robberies, okay? And the Captain and I are gonna have dinner tonight and discuss it. So tell me, Captain, how long have you secretly been the head of the FBI and the CIA? Calling all cars, calling all cars. Be on the lookout for the bag man. The Captain received an anonymous tip reporting him in our precinct. Be on the alert. For the benefit show tonight, you don't mind if I wait outside again do ya? No, no problem. Go right ahead. Great. Car 86, report to 714 Conch street. Transvestite disturbing the peace. Ten four. Here we go. Shoot me! Shoot me! Boy, people are really strange this time of night. No, they're not!

Repeat, armed and dangerous. Melvin, be careful! They're armed and dangerous! Alright, everybody, this is a bust! No, this is a bust. She's right. What you got in your hand there? It's a joint!

Feels interesting. Oh, I'm horny! Holy cow! No offense. Ooh, you got a beard! I didn't even see the beard! Did you see that! I've never seen it either! He's got no hair on his chest. I don't feel a thing, to tell you the truth. Maybe a little hungry. Oh yeah look at this! Test for a dollar! Melvin, Melvin come in! Sue, come in Sue! Sue, one Adam 12! Hey these things, these razors they'll give you a close shave. You want a close shave, I'll give you a close shave! Listen you clowns, I just received another anonymous tip that the next bar to be robbed by this bag man is Leroy A Go-Go, a black club over on Carver. You guys are gonna report as undercover policemen. Undercover? Yes, undercover! When do we report? Right now! You don't have much time! Ten four, ten four, Captain and roger and out. Okay, bye!

As far as I'm concerned, you're my number one suspect. What were you doing in that bathroom? Number two. Okay, you're my number two suspect. You two guys really screwed it up didn't ya, huh? I'm gonna give you one more chance. We'll go to the Comedy Cabaret and we're gonna find out once and for all, if the Unknown Comic is really the bag man or if you are the Unknown Comic or if maybe the bag man is you or the Unknown Comic is the bag man or if you're not the Unknown Comic and you're not the bag man then we're gonna go over and find out. Come on, let me help you out. Take this, kid, go around the corner. We don't want to arouse any suspicion. Yes sir! Who's the owner of this place? I am. What seems to be the trouble, officer? No trouble at all. We're just going to find out if the Unknown Comic is really a comic. Who are these two idiots? We're also undercover police officers. I hope someone uncovers the Unknown Comic soon. It's almost showtime and he hasn't shown up yet. We want a few words with him after the show. Well, I wouldn't be too hard on him. He probably has a pretty good excuse. It'll be very interesting to find out if the Unknown Comic shows up at all. Right, Melvin? Right, Captain. I gotta go to the bar and mingle. Let me check your doll. Put me down! Get out of here! And Melvin, you stay right there! Don't you move! And Tex, you keep an eye on Melvin! Captain Lewis you said you were gonna call me last night and you didn't. Were you lying? If I lie to you, may the Lord take my voice away! Wait a sec, drink this. Those guys sure don't seem to trust you very much. No, they think that I know something about this Unknown Comic character. There's been a rumor that the Unknown Comic and this bag man that's been robbing all the bars is one and the same. Yeah, well I've got a feeling neither one of them is gonna show up tonight. Hi, I know this is the night you've all been waiting for. Please welcome the Unknown Comic! What I'm going to do for you is gonna make your boobies fall off. You already heard it! Oh, she's pissed now! Don't worry, I can make your boobies seem larger. I have small hands. I'm telling you I just flew in from Las Vegas. Yeah, what a bummer. I got airsick and nobody knew! Some of you suckers are holding in your laughs. Don't do that folks. It creates gas. That's right, everybody give me an H. H! Give me an A! A! Give me an H! H! Give me an A! A! What's it spell? Haha! There don't you feel better? Nobody move a muscle. I swear to God, I'll blow you away! You, put all the money in this bag right now! Move it! Now, give it to me!

So that explains all those anonymous phone calls. Why? No offense, Melvin. Just a little bored. I needed the money. You two know each other? Yeah. But he didn't know that I know he's the Unknown Comic. Wait a minute, we just left the Unknown Comic at the stage at the Comedy Cabaret. If that's the Unknown Comic and I'm here then who the hell is that guy? Captain Lewis, we caught the bag man! Good. What happened to the Unknown Comic? I don't know. Oh, there he is! Excuse me, out of my way! Come on, I've got you now! Alright, let's see who you are! Sue! Melvin. But why? No one else is trying to help you. When I heard that Captain Lewis was gonna be watching you so closely, I knew you couldn't change into the Unknown Comic. But my voice, how did you do my voice? That was easy. I found a tape when I was going through your locker of your act and so I put it on the backstage microphone. And nobody could see my mouth moving under the bag, so I just jumped around on stage. What a great idea! I could franchise the Unknown Comic and make a fortune! Melvin! Oh Sue! Oh Melvin! Oh Sue! Oh Melvin! Wait a minute, you've got an act to finish! We can't make love like this anymore! Finish the job! Hey, like Robert De Niro says Oh, Oh yeah! Get down there you little cutie! Way down there! I'm going baby! I don't believe it! Are you calling me a liar? And action! Captain, uh, shit! We're coming. Captain, uh, Kent Lane not reporting. Marker. Action! Hi, Sue! Action! Hi, Sue! Hi, Sue! And action! Oh hi, Sue!
