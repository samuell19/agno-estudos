Whether it was bowling or fly fishing... He's looking at his shoes. You're kidding. Mmm-mmm. So, you know, I appreciate the time I had with Sammy. 'Cause it was far too short. [Begins to cry] Oh... oh... When you lose someone early, there's just that void. [Sniffles] Well, now he's looking at you. Yeah, well that definitely caught his attention. I knew you'd think of something. Yeah, I usually do. His gusto, attitude. - Let's raise a glass for Sam. - To Sam! I'm gonna miss you, Sam. - To Sam. - To Sam. Guest: Miss ya buddy! [Scoffs] I can't believe you are still crushing on him. All those years on the island he never gave you the time of day. Yeah, but we were young and I was fat and things change. Yeah, some things never do. Meaning? Nothing. Just spit it out. You're trying to get laid. Janice, you say that like it's a bad thing, big sister. We're at a funeral, little sister.

Why don't we go to my place instead, hmm? Jim: I say we focus on developing a comprehensive project management system, not an update. An entirely new software package. I'm telling you, it'll be huge. This is the software that'll buy you that 100-foot yacht. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Let me stop you right there, Jean. Those subcontractors screwed the pooch last time and I don't think we should rely on...

He's into things you wouldn't believe. Ooh, things? Yeah, like he got these fuzzy pink handcuffs off the Internet. [Laughs] Russel's into bondage? Well, I think he'd like to be into that kind of thing. Do you want to be into that sort of thing? I mean, I'm not judging you if you do, but if you don't, he's pressuring you. Uh, it's not that. It's-we fight a lot but I try to focus on his good qualities. Such as? He's good with money. If he wasn't managing this place we would have gone under a long time ago. Speaking of money, this is why I hate being a landlord, but I need to ask you for this month's rent cheque. You should just buy my house already so we don't have to keep doing this. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. Russel wrote the cheque and I left it at home. I'll get it to you. Ok, thanks. See? That's what you really need. You need an accountant. You don't need Russel. He's good with our daughter. Ok, so you need an accountant and a nanny then. Seriously, you could do so much better than Russel. You think? Yeah. I mean, maybe not at first but once you drop a few pounds. Excuse me?

You don't have any friends. Fine. We'll invite your friends, then. What about Peggy and whoever she's dating these days? Jim. She's dating a guy named Jim and I don't think they need any help with their sex life. You never know. Plus, he's going back to Florida in a few days. Great! Is she throwing him a going away party for him? Not a party, just a couple of us going out for drinks. Perfect! No way in hell am I showing up at a pub waving an armload of dildos. Are you out of your mind? I don't know, am I? Wha? Look at... [Laughing] I... I've got the tab. I'm treating all my ladies tonight. - Thank you. - Thank you. You two are like...

I sure as hell don't want you to be devastated. Yeah, well Brenna can be a bit over-the-top sometimes. I sure am gonna miss you, but uh, I'm a survivor. You deserve more than just survival. I'd like to think so. Are you satisfied with your life? I mean, who's ever really satisfied? Sometimes I think about leaving Whidbey island and going somewhere warm. I always thought, you know, Vegas would be fun. What about you? Are you satisfied? What's your dream? Uh... You wanna know the truth? Nothing but. I've always wanted to kill someone. [Laughing] Who doesn't wanna kill someone? Who's on your list? Oh, bosses, ex-wives... Wives? [Laughs] But that's not really what I'm dreaming about right now. Yeah, well you're gonna have to get used to dreaming because this is your farewell celebration, remember? What kind of fool would celebrate leaving you? Damn right. If I didn't have my whole life back in Florida... My business, you know. It's just- you know what I think? I think what we have is special, and so normal rules, they don't apply, ok? Mmm.

Well, maybe you could visit him. Oh, I don't chase men, Janice. They chase me. Suit yourself. I'm putting all this in the laundry. Oh. You treat me like a queen. I know. Damn. So that's Jean.

Are you even listening to me? Sorry, yes. Vegas. I'm glad things are working out for you. Isn't life an amazing adventure?

And now we're never gonna have to say goodbye to each other ever again. What? Nothing. I thought you were happy for me. I am. It's just... Russ has been all up in my face again. Just thinking about another thing that he did. He was doing our taxes and he's all like "Brenna, where are the bank statements? "Where are the receipts? "How do you manage to spend $604 at Costco? "Blah, blah, blah. Dammit Brenna." Oh, my god! I'm so sick of listening to you whine about Russel this and Russel that. You can't even be happy for me for two minutes because you're so busy complaining. If you're so miserable why don't you just grow a spine and do something about it, huh? Well, it's not that simple to just up and leave your husband. Yeah, it is. I did it. Twice. But we have a kid together. I'm sorry. I'm-I'm sorry. Sally's great. I... look, I'm just trying to give you a little bit of tough love. Sometimes, the truth, it's hard to take, but when you-when you finally face it it sets you free. Hey, I know this is a bad time but do you have my rent cheque? Thank you. Oh, there's my ride. Listen, I know that you've got this because you are a smart woman no matter what Russel says.

No, I meant take him out. Permanently. What? I could end him. No. No! He is not perfect but he's the father of my child. I would never want him harmed. Peggy? He's kidding. He's kidding. So, my half-sister took off in the middle of the night. I guess I scared her. Do you want to explain yourself, Jim? I'm not a psychopath. Well, that's reassuring. And I'm not a sadist. It's not-it's not like I enjoy hurting people. Jim, you offered to kill her husband. I know. I know. Have you ever wanted revenge so bad that it poisons every bit of joy that life hands you? Revenge against who? My step-dad. He used to beat my mom and I'd hear her screaming and crying, and if I tried to stop it, he'd lay a beating on me, too. I despised that man. I am so sorry. I get it. I get it. I have my own demons. I get it. I'm the sorry one. All these years and I'm still filled with rage. I should have protected her. I didn't have the guts to stand up to him. Where is he now? Oh, he's dead and buried. Long ago. So there's comfort in that, right? Not at all. That bastard died peacefully in his sleep. He never got what he deserved. I should have killed him when I had the chance. Jim, you can't keep living with this. There's gotta be some way you can let it go. Jim, I am here living my dream in Vegas because of you. You.

Well, with Russel gone and the salon going under I've got no money and it turns out Russel's got nothing in the bank. Besides, even if we do get divorced it's not like I'm looking at some huge settlement. So you-you're broke? Shit. I had to empty my bank account to buy my plane ticket here, so... Why would you do that? I don't know. 'Cause you're the one with all the bright ideas, Peggy. What're you talking about? You don't even remember?

You drink these all the time? All the time. [Sighs] Oh... I'm attracted to his darkness. I know that probably sounds weird to you, being married to Russel. What are you attracted to, his blandness?

Look at you, galavanting all over the continent with your drunk buddies while I scramble to find child care. Maybe I should do a little travelling. Take Sally to Alaska to visit my dad. You wouldn't dare. You know what, maybe I'll take her there permanently. Sally! It's time to go. This is too far, Russ. [Mocking] This is too far, Russ. Say goodbye to your father! Bye, daddy! Bye, sweetheart, I'll see you soon. [Sighs] This feels sudden, so I want to talk it over with you. If the judge signs your restraining order Russel won't be able to contact you or come within 100 yards of you. Are you certain you want to proceed? Absolutely. Alright. I'll need you to describe the incidents that have prompted you to file. He said he was gonna take Sally to Alaska and not come back. Plus, he yells at me. - Verbal abuse? - Big time. And he yells at our daughter. He neglects her, too. He's a very neglectful father. Has there been physical abuse? Not so much. But he says he's gonna get me when I'm not looking. Get you? He said he's gonna punch me in the face and hold me under the tub water 'til my feet stop kicking. I sleep with a knife under my pillow. I don't trust him. [Sighs] I cannot believe that bartender from the other night. I mean, the nerve of that guy. We spend so much money in that place you think they'd be begging us to show up. I do think we class up that dump a little bit, don't you? We need money, Peggy. I thought you were a self-made millionaire. And I thought you were gonna sell your house to Brenna. Brenna's broke, you know that. So what's this really about, Jim? The Microsoft sale was years ago. That money's pretty much gone. And what about that fancy new software you're working on? I haven't been developing the software, I've been partying with you! Is that really so awful?! No. It's been great. But I gotta go home. You mean Florida. I've gotta work. We've been spending money like crazy. My credit cards are maxed out and my savings account is nearly empty. You do realize that you could- you could work here, right? So why do you really wanna go back to Florida? She is my wife, Peggy. Oh, finally. Finally, the truth! Plus, all my business connections are in Florida. And my software company. My bank accounts. And your precious wife, Jean. Am I not enough for you, Jim? You are more than enough for me. But neither of us can afford this lifestyle! [Exhales] If you go back... I will come down there and I will bang and bang on your door, wife or no wife. [Phone rings] [Sighs] What is it, Brenna? Guess what? I took a restraining order out on Russel. And here I was thinking you were calling to apologize for the late rent, again. Oh yeah. Sorry about that. Anyways, you wanna know what pushed me over the edge? When I came back from Vegas he threatened me and Sally. He was so abusive. Now he can't come anywhere near us. And I say good riddance. He's such an idiot. Wasting money on skateboards he can't ride, guitars he can't play. Life insurance he can't cash in. Life insurance? Yeah, he's got like three policies now. Anyway, babe, I gotta go. Sally will be home soon. I'll call you later. And these are the lights. [Character voice] I like the lights. And that's my mommy. Just eat your cauliflower and then you can go play. But it's gross. It's good for you. [Character voice] It smells like a diaper. Just eat your food or I'm telling your father. You're gonna call daddy? Can I talk to him, too? No. But... I miss him. I miss him, too, honey. Then why won't you let me see him? Because it's-it just-it- it's grown up stuff. Just go to your room. But... Just go on! Go to your room! I hate you! What have I done? [Phone ringing] Detective Williams. This is Brenna Douglas. Mrs. Douglas. How can I help you? I wanna cancel the restraining order. Daddy! Hey, honey. I made a superhero cape for my bunny. Oh, that's awesome. Can I see? You did this all by yourself? Wow, cool. Hey, sweetie, um, mom and I need to talk. So I should go play? You got it. Got it. See ya, kiddo. So, the restraining order. So sorry about that. What made you change your mind? I was overreacting. You didn't do anything to justify that. Well, I'm sorry for the things I said. I'd never take Sally away from you. You're a good mom, Brenna. You're a good father. We're just not a good couple. We used to be, remember? I remember being crazy about you. Same here. Hey, can we try again? Please? Sally, it's time for me to go. Bye, mama! I guess that's a "no". Give me time. These late fees, they're-they're obscene. I mean, how do you expect anyone to off their bill when you keep charging- collector: They're the conditions you agreed to. Unfortunately, there are consequences for defaulting- no, I understand the consequences of not paying on time, I mean, I'm not an- but your inability to make the minimum monthly payment we have to cancel your card. No, no. You can't cancel my card! What am I gonna live on? Have a nice day. Dammit. Hey, rockstar. How was the audition? They're a shit band, anyway. Fran-Fran. Russel, explain this to me, why? It's over, ok? Can you just tell me why? I love Brenna. And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to win her back. No. Please don't do this. Goodbye. Russel! Russ- do you believe me now? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah? [Laughs] Can I come home? Please? Patience. We have a lot to work on. Ok. Ok. Patience. Ok. This isn't very patient. God. Yeah, well, I'm sorry but I've got bills to pay, too, Jim. It's just until I get paid. Paid? I thought you couldn't find any gigs. I'm sure I'll get something soon. I hope so. I can't send you any more money 'cause I don't have any. Can you borrow some? I'll try. You know, I do miss you, Jim. I gotta go. Bye. I can't believe I haven't gotten any offers on the house. I really hope Brenna can buy it. Brenna's broke. Yeah, because Russel spends all his money on sex toys and life insurance. You know, maybe we should take a trip home for Christmas. Hmm. [Phone rings] Hey, Brenna, is something wrong? No, not at all. I was just thinking... Maybe you could spend Christmas with us. That-that'd be great. [Phone rings] Hello? Russel. Peggy. Hi. I have a gift for Brenna. Alright, great. You have a present for Brenna? That's what I said. And Russel, listen, we weren't supposed to get each other presents so it's a surprise. You can't tell her, ok? My lips are sealed, I promise. Alright, thank you. I'm gonna hand you to Jim. Ok. Oh, look, there's Brenna. I'm gonna go say hi. Brenna! Hey. [Laughing] Hey! I'm back! Oh, I missed your hugs. You're like a short, little grizzly bear. So, what's new? Tell me everything. Oh, you know, the usual. Sally's getting excited for Christmas. Of course. She's thrilled that her father's joining us for the holidays. What? I cancelled the restraining order. Uh-huh. So I... I invited him over. Oh, that's nice. For Russel, at least. Anyhow, we'll talk about this later, alright? Good morning. Good morning. Come on over. Daddy! There's my little elf! [Laughs] How are ya? Do you wanna help me? Careful. There's something special in there. - Hey. - Hey. How are ya? Nice to see you. - The place looks great. - Thank you. Look at this. Is she finally in bed? Yep. Dreaming of sugar plums. What's this? Well, I know we said we weren't gonna exchange gifts this year but I just wanted to get you something letting you know how I feel. Damn you, Russel Douglas. Go ahead. Open it. It's a swing. Like... from a jungle gym? Not exactly. Jesus Christ, Russel. What, you don't like it? We said we were gonna take things slow. You call this slow? Well, I mean... What're you doing? Oh look, bad boys ii is on. Great. [Gunshots in TV] [Gun shot] You must really hate them. Huh? Pigeons. Oh yeah. Well, it's flying rats, right? They crap all over our patio. I bought the gun so I could get rid of them. Well, it'll do the trick, for sure. You gotta any other questions on how to use it? What's up? I was mean last night.

Mrs. Douglas, this is my partner, detective steadman. Hello, ma'am. I wondered if we could ask you a few questions about your husband. Is this about the restraining order? Things have been bad between us for years but we've been trying to make our marriage work. I hope we can. How long have the two of you been separated? A couple of months. And the reason for your separation? Well, she knows. Um, we fought constantly and he was cheating on me. With whom? Multiple women. And men. One man. At least, I suspect. And a variety of women. Or-or one. One woman for sure. An older woman. He liked to brag about having sex and partying with her. He was into some kinky stuff. I- I just can't accept his deviant lifestyle. And by "deviant lifestyle" you mean... He wants me to swing with him and he gets mad when I say no. I think he wants to join a key club. I hear they meet Saturdays at a- at a restaurant on the island. Brenna, we um- and he dresses like a freak. He wore a kilt to work. And he thinks everything he sees on the Internet is normal. And he's very controlling. And very abusive. Physically abusive? Well, not-not so much. Just mentally. Brenna, do you know why we're here? Not really. Your husband, Russel, was found dead in his car this afternoon. Oh. He was shot in the head. Oh. [Phone rings] I should get that. She didn't seem too surprised. Didn't seem too broken up about it, either. Suspect? Definitely. So I'm gonna um, head to the airport, get on a stand-by to Miami. You're not staying. No. Just, I... I thought maybe I'd lay low for a bit. Check in on the business, you know? But you're coming back, right? Sure. Remember what you told me? What we have is special. God, who would do such a thing? Is it true that Brenna and Russel were trying to get back together? [Scoffs] It never would have worked out. Those two were doomed. Well, at least they were trying. I wish my ex and I had tried harder to save our marriage. Poor Brenna. She must be a mess. You know the whidbey gossips are all over this. People are saying she's a suspect. Hmm. Spoken with the Vic's family, co-workers, landlord, ex-girlfriend. As far as I can tell, Russel Douglas had no enemies. He was well-liked by everyone. Well, not everyone. There is one person who doesn't seem very fond of him. You mean his wife? Brenna's hard to read. One minute she hates his guts... The next she's cancelling the restraining order. Your husband died December 26. You filed an insurance claim January 3rd. Why the rush? I'm real bad with money. Russel handled all the financial stuff. I got Jack squat in the bank. My salon's going down the tubes. I don't even own this house. I just-i want enough to support myself. And my daughter, of course. Wheeler pacific insurance empathizes, Mrs. Douglas. Here's the problem. The police informed us you are a person of interest in your husband's murder. Why would I wanna kill my own husband? Well, some may say the insurance money could be a motive. Would you agree to take a polygraph test? Nope. Nope? My lawyer advised against it. I'll be frank. The company is reluctant to issue the money to you. We'd be willing, however, to set up a trust fund for your daughter. My lawyer said you might pull something like this so we prepared a statement. [Clears throat] I, Brenna Douglas, categorically state that I was not involved in the death of my husband in any way. The insurance proceeds are rightfully mine and it is inappropriate to withhold the money or award it to my child based on unsupported allegations. There you go. That's your copy. Come on, Jim. Where are you? [Glass shatters] [Phone ringing] Whidbey police, detective Steadman speaking. How can I help you? Tipster: Do you have a recent unsolved murder on whidbey island? Yes, we have an open homicide investigation from December 26th. Sir? Are you still there? I have information but I'm scared to talk about it. Ok, what kind of information? The shooter is a friend of mine. Ok. What's his name? He has this girlfriend. All they do is party. They've been hard up for cash. Living off credit cards. What's her name? [Hangs up] Sir? Hello? [Dial tone] Thank you, Mrs. Martino. I'll be in touch if there's anything else. Peggy: Hey babe! Finally! Is this Peggy sue Thomas? Uh, who's asking, please? I'm detective Williams, whidbey island pd. Peggy sue Thomas? Yes, this is Peggy. Miss Thomas, I'm calling because your name came up in our investigation into the murder of Russel Douglas. Oh, really? We gather you knew Mr. Douglas? Yeah, uh, a bit. I worked at the salon with his wife. What a tragedy. It's uh, I'm kind of an unwilling landlord for Brenna. She's planning on buying my house, but... Were you in touch with Russel during the holidays? Yeah, we played a little bit of phone tag trying to arrange a gift exchange. A gift exchange? I got a surprise for Brenna. Thank you, miss Thomas. I'll be in touch if I have any more questions. You'll be in touch if you have any more questions? Oh, I don't think so, detective Williams. You called all the numbers from Russel Douglas's phone records, yeah? I just got off with Peggy sue Thomas. She called Russel a couple days before Christmas. Doesn't seem to be anything there. Alright. Ok. [Ringing] This is Jim, leave a message. [Beep] [Teary] Stop being a wuss and call me back. We need to talk. [Ringing] Peggy. I've been calling and calling. Why haven't you called me back? I know, I'm sorry, it's just uh... Ever since I heard about Russel I uh, I've just been so upset. Well, I've been upset too. I-I needed you, Peggy. I just didn't know what to say. It's just so awful. And poor Sally, growing up without a father? Now all she has is me and you know I'm a mess. Yeah, well... You know, Brenna, you're gonna be stronger and you're gonna get through this. I just know it. Ok. Yeah. Thanks. Hey, um, the police just called me. Did they-did they ask you about me or something? No, they probably got your number from Russel's phone records. Of course. That makes so much sense. Yeah. Um, I have some news. I had to fight tooth and nail for it but I finally got the insurance money. One policy, at least. Oh my god, that's great! You can buy my house. Yeah, um... actually, I’m-I'm really sorry Peggy, but I couldn't stay there. There are too many memories. I saw a house for sale and I fell in love and I bought it. This place, just- it feels better. It's a new start for us. I- I hope you understand. Peggy, are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Congratulations, I guess. I hope you're not upset. Brenna, I-I gotta run. Can we talk about this some other time? I'm uh-i gotta go, ok? God!!! Hey. Wanna go on a trip? When you were gone I couldn't catch a buzz no matter how hard I tried. Now I feel high all the time. I just wish you felt the same. You know me, Jean. I've always had my ups and downs. Yeah, but not this bad. Not like this. You know you can tell me anything. [Knocking] Don't move. Hello. I'm sorry if my arrival is uncomfortable for you. But this? This is bullshit. Jim just came back so he could sponge off of you. He's not sponging off of me. He left you. He loves me. And you need to face that. Oh honey, you just don't get it, do you? His body, it may be here, but his heart? It belongs with me. Tell her that's not true. She's my wife. I love her. I'm not leaving her. I'm sorry, Peggy. You're a fool, Jim Huden. You know, the cops called me. What? You better watch yourself, Jim. [Door opens, closes] What was she talking about? You remember what I told you about my step-father? Yeah. Something happened on whidbey island. What? What do you mean? Well, I did it, Jean. I did it. I was hoping you'd call again. I didn't know if I was gonna, but... I keep seeing that poor guy getting shot in the face. Well, I'm glad you did call back. Yeah, well, whatever. I heard something kinda urgent. Go on. The shooter's planning on flying to Vegas to visit his girlfriend. Uh, by girlfriend you're referring to uh... Peggy sue Thomas? [Sighs] Yeah, Peggy. She was just here and they had a big fight. He's afraid that she's mad at him. Plus, he wants to make sure that they have their stories straight. So he's going to Vegas soon. You should probably get to him first. Well, it's tough for us to catch this guy if we don't know his name. Sir, are you still there? Jim Huden. His name is Jim Huden and he lives in Punta Gorda. And who am I speaking to? My name is Neil Dodson. I'm his best friend. [Hangs up] Uh, hello? Sir? Uh, we need to get some- search warrants. I'm on it. Well, it's been a couple days now. Are you gonna... Say something or what? That was a lot to take in, Jim. But honestly, I've... I've never felt closer to you. And I understand why you did it. You had demons to slay. Thanks. I do have to take a quick trip to Vegas. What? Why? [Knocking] [Knocking] Jim huden? Yeah. Detective Steadman. Whidbey island police. Mind if I ask you a couple questions? Peggy sue Thomas? Yes. Detective Williams, whidbey island pd. We spoke on the phone. Come on in. Someone ambushed Russel Douglas. Now, I've been told that you were the man that pulled the trigger. I don't know why someone would say that. I- I've never even owned a gun. Ok. Who told you that? I'm not about to disclose my source, Mr. Huden. Damn, I knew she was pissed off at me, but... Is Peggy angry enough that she'd try to frame me for Russel's murder? We believe you were involved in Russel Douglas's murder. What brings you to that ridiculous conclusion? Jim huden mentioned you in connection to the crime. I really doubt that, but nice try. We also have a sworn statement from a good friend of Jim Huden's. I don't believe you. Maybe you know him. Neil Dodson. So that's all you have is hearsay. Do you have any real evidence? I'll ask the questions, Peggy. What about a murder weapon? Have you ever owned a gun, miss Thomas? No. So, you have no murder weapon, what about a motive? I mean, what possible reason could I have for wanting Russel Douglas dead? We have our theories. No, you don't have anything, detective Williams. Sugar? She's so smug you just wanna slap that smirk off her face. Mmmhmm. Well, Jim huden is no prize, either. Oh, about that time. You really think this is gonna help? Somebody out there knows something. It's worth a try. We now turn your attention to the whidbey island police department. This is detective Todd Steadman of the whidbey police department with a special announcement. We are asking for the public's help in a homicide investigation. Former whidbey island residence James huden and Peggy Thomas have been identified as persons of interest in the Russel Douglas murder. [Knocking] You're back. How nice. Isn't it, though? The last time we spoke you seemed disappointed that we hadn't found the murder weapon. Do you recognize this gun? No. One of Jim Huden's friends was holding onto it for him. So? We found your fingerprints on the gun manual. And? And now we're gonna search your house. Gentlemen? [Phone ringing] Hello? Put him on the phone. It's Peggy. [Slam] Yes, Peggy? You didn't get rid of the gun? The gun? I... I didn't keep it. No! You gave it to a friend to hang onto! And then you confessed the entire thing to your bass player! How did you know? Because the cops were just here! They're the ones that told me! Peggy. Jim, I am absolutely not going to prison because of your poor judgement. Do you understand me? Ok? They've searched my house, they impounded my car. Ok, we'll figure this out, I just... I didn't-i didn't think- oh, no, Jim. No, Jim, you didn't think. You didn't think at all, ok? If I go to prison it's all on you! All on you!!! So you tell me you killed someone and now you're just gonna disappear with the last of our cash? And enough of my oxy to kill an elephant?! Yeah, I saw what you packed. It's not worth killing yourself over. I love you, Jean. I love you. So we still don't have anything on Peggy. And Jim? All these months and we're no closer to finding him. I keep thinking if I look hard enough I'll find something new. Well, I doubt Jim huden is hiding in these photographs. Well, then where the hell is he? When Jim vanished those were really dark times for me. A lesser woman might have been destroyed by what I went through but if there's one thing you can say about me it's that I'm resilient. You never fail to amaze me, Peggy. They say rebound romances don't work and yet here you are. Mmm. Here I am. It's beautiful. It is, isn't it? You know, Mark has so much real estate the whole family could move down here. Has he agreed to that? He will. He just doesn't know it yet. [Laughs] Ooh, bubbly. [Pop] [Gasp] Peggy: The end of my marriage to Mark was also the end of my financial troubles. My heartbreak over losing him was soothed by a brand new houseboat, a ranch, and several cars. If there's one thing you can say about me it's that I am resilient. That is so unfair. The other insurance company paid me. Agent: Ma'am, the policy on pre-existing conditions does not include... That money is long gone. Watch your fingers. I'm a grieving widow. How can you deny my claim? Why should I be punished because Russel didn't tell you about his heart murmur? This is a policy that has... I've been keeping tabs on the key players. Brenna bought a house then lost it to foreclosure. Peggy got married and divorced. Williams: And what about Jean huden? Jim's long-suffering wife. Well, her suffering is about to get worse. What's that mean? I just spoke to the punta gorda chief of police. Good news. I'm heading back to Florida. Mmmhmm. [Knocking] Police! Shit. [Knocking] [Knocking] Police! Open up! Oh, god. Mrs. Huden. You've been charged on 18 separate counts ranging from possession to fraud to grand larceny. Those are very serious charges. Yeah, I know. I know. Obviously you're struggling. Your husband cheated on you and he left you dealing with the aftermath of his crime. I loved that man so much. And look where it's gotten you. I have been so stupid. Jean, you could go to jail for a long, long time. Or you could tell us where Jim- he's in Mexico. He's teaching guitar. They call him "maestro Jim". [Strumming] Steadman: Jim huden. Hello, Peggy. Oh, you again. I have something for you. What is it? You're under arrest for the murder of Russel Douglas. Special delivery from whidbey island. What is it? It's a warrant for your arrest. I need you to turn around and put your hands behind your back. No, you are not putting those on me. Actually, I am. No, no, no, no, no, no! - Peggy sue Thomas. - You can't do this! You can't arrest me! - You have been charged. - I didn't do anything. -With first degree murder. -I didn't do anything wrong! -You have the right to remain silent. -You can't make me... -Everything you say can and will be used against you... -I don't even have shoes on! Will you please let me go back- Russel Douglas' death was not just a murder. It was an assassination. Jim huden walked up to Russel's car, looked him in the eye, and shot him point blank. I met Jim huden but, uh, I didn't really know him. Did you tell Peggy sue Thomas that your husband, Russel, had been abusive? Yeah. Jim told me his step-father used to beat him. He said "I always hated that man with a passion. "I wanted to find someone who was just like him "and get revenge." And did he find someone? He thought he had. Peggy sue Thomas convinced him that Russel Douglas was an abusive husband. [Courtroom chatter] Will the defendant please rise? The jury finds the defendant, Jim huden, guilty of first degree aggravated murder. [Slam] [Courtroom chatter] Peggy: It took the jury eight days to sentence Jim to 80 years in prison. 80 years. That's twice the normal sentence. I'm so lucky to be out on bail. Thoughts? It's very Peggy. And? Maybe for a murder trial you might wanna tone it down a bit. See, that's why I love you. You're very sensible. Not that it matters what I wear. If there's any justice at all I'll be exonerated. D.a.: Mr. Huden, you've been sentenced to 80 years in prison. Now if Ms. Thomas has played any role in this murder, volunteering that information could result in a significant reduction in your sentence. Again, I plead the fifth. Of course, Jim refused to testify against me. They don't have a single witness that links me to this crime. I thought his wife claimed to- Jean huden, the druggie with an axe to grind? Uh, unreliable. What about Jim's buddy, the bass player? What, Neil Dodson? Oh, he's not testifying. He's in the hospital in critical condition because he had a heart attack. [Chuckles] Karma's a bitch, right? I suppose. You know, I have heard rumours about a third witness but I have no idea who it could be. I can't eat. I can't sleep. My hair is falling out. I know this is hard. But I really appreciate you coming forward like this. I can't stop thinking about Russel sitting in his car alone, and then... Ma'am? [Sniffles] How can people be so cruel? I often wonder that myself. Let's go through this one more time. We were discussing my ex-husband and Jim said "I can take him out for you". And what did you interpret that to mean? It was clear what he meant. And Peggy? She just sat there, listening. Look, I know it's hard to talk about this. It takes a lot of courage. Just try to get some rest. Yeah. I'm so tired. I need sleep. Thank you. Given my client's unique circumstances, we're requesting a trial delay so that she can tie up loose ends. Loose ends? Mmmhmm. Well, I may not be familiar with the nuances, as you put it. But I do know that your request is highly unusual. My client would like to speak. Go on. Your honour, I'd just like to explain. I need to attend a memorial service for my sister who recently took her own life. Your honour, may I remind you that Ms. Thomas is referring to her late half-sister, Janice Nevins, who gave a sworn statement against her before she committed suicide. In addition, your honour, I need to raise money to pay to fight these ridiculous charges. I need to liquidate assets. I must maintain my home and my garden in keeping with the standards of the homeowner's association of my gated community. I need to go to the dentist in Nevada, I need to winterize my houseboat, and I need to retrieve documents that'll be useful in my defence. I also need to get winter clothing. And I need to transport my vehicle to whidbey so that I can use it during the trial. Your honour, we do have dentists here in Washington state. And clothing stores and rental cars. And surely Ms. Thomas can find someone to cut her grass and winterize her boat. Valid points, counsellor. Most importantly, your honour, the prosecution views Peggy Thomas as a flight risk. [Laughs] Your honour, do I really look like some desperado outlaw on the run? My whole world has been thrown into chaos. My lover is gone to prison, my sister has gone to her grave. Ow, that stings. Thanks, that's-that's better. Anyway, my arraignment's coming up pretty fast, so I wanted to look my best. I mean, there's bound to be tons of people. Paparazzi, even. Plus, they don't let you wear make-up in prison so I thought I'd cover all my bases. I mean, you gotta admit that it's pretty crazy that judge just let me outta there. But in the last two weeks I have had an epiphany. I mean, why would I subject myself to the public scrutiny that an unfair trial would bring? So I decided I don't really want a trial. Peggy sue Thomas, you have pled guilty to rendering criminal assistance in the first degree. Yes, your honour. I- I just wanna be clear, your honour. One thing that we know for sure now based on the court's colloquy with Ms. Thomas is that she did in fact knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily admit to her involvement in assisting Jim huden in connection with the murder of Russel Douglas. I'm sentencing you to the maximum penalty that can be imposed for this plea. Four years in the Washington state penitentiary. [Slams gavel] Some crowd. Disappointed? All that make-up for nothing? Peggy. I'm from the Washington celebrity news. Why'd you do it? What makes you so sure I did? Why would I want Russel Douglas dead? I didn't profit from his death in any way. By pleading guilty to a lesser charge I'm avoiding an unfair trial along with the insane 45-year sentence I could have faced. As for Brenna Douglas, the cops never could connect her to the murder. She was never charged. Whereas I've been sentenced to four years in prison. Four years for what? For falling in love with the wrong man? And Brenna, all she got was rid of Russel. Plus, a big chunk of insurance money and the chance to start all over again somewhere new. She changed her name, and left whidbey island. And Sally? There's still hope for Sally. Lucky them. Meanwhile, my life has become a tabloid story with headlines about "the beauty queen killer". Like my looks have anything to do with this. I'm just another victim. I'm losing four years of my life just to appease my accusers. But I think we can agree I did nothing wrong.
