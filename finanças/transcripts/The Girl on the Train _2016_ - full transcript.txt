My husband used to tell me I have an overactive imagination. I can't help it. I mean, haven't you ever been on a train and wondered about the lives of the people who live near the tracks? The lives you've never lived. These are things I want to know. Twice a day, I sit in the third car from the front where I have the perfect view into my favorite house. Number 15 Beckett Road. I don't know when exactly. I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually, as the months went past, she became important to me. I'm not the girl I used to be. I think people can see it on my face. She's what I lost. She's everything I want to be. I imagine she's a painter. She's creative. He is a doctor or an architect. He has a good laugh. She can't cook. I wonder what they say to each other before they go to sleep. Today, her name is Jess. Tomorrow, it could be Lisa or Amber. It all depends on the day. It depends on my mood. The truth is, I don't know her name. I don't know if she paints or whether he has a good laugh. I just know they know love. Sometimes I catch myself trying to remember the last time I had meaningful contact with another person. I used to live two doors down, number 13 Beckett Road. Nm It was my first home. We bought it together. It was ours. Every day I tell myself not to look. But then I look. Are you alone? Yeah. No. Come. It's all yours. Okay. Your baby's so cute. Oh, thank you. Hi, baby! Is it a boy? Yeah! So sweet! How old is he? Six months. Six months. So sweet. Shh. A teacher once told me I was a mistress of self-reinvention. I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time. But since moving here, I've come to understand it. Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine. It's a fucking baby factory. I wanna start my life over again. So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director, nanny, and a whore. And not necessarily in that order. I can't just be a wife anymore. That's why I stay awake at night, staring at the ceiling. In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running. You always felt that way? Maybe since I was about 17. Hmm. With Mac. ABDICI Mac? Who's Mac? My brother's best friend. My brother who died. I tend to smile when I'm nervous. Sometimes I laugh. For a year, Mac: and I lived in this hunting cabin. We started fucking. We were the saddest people we knew. But in a way, that cabin made us happy. No one could find us. Everyone thought we were dead. And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go? I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you. I'm pretty sure Scott thinks the nanny job is gonna make me less restless. Make me wanna get pregnant. And that's not the case? When I finish work every night, I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can. Ah. When you woke up this morning, I went and I brought you back to bed with me. And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Anna Happy birthday to you Oh. Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he? Yes, he did. Thank you, Megan. There you go. Shh, shh, shh. Ooh, hello. I swear, I sometimes feel like my heart is gonna explode. I mean, look at her. Look at her! You're not sleeping! Hello? You're not sleeping. Hello? Hello? Is that another hang-up? Mmm-hmm. And grab the corners. And straight. I got another job. You what? I'm really sorry, Anna. I thought you were happy here. I mean, you seemed happy here. I am. It's just this isn't what I do. Take care of children? Or laundry. Another gallery headhunted me. That's great. The thing is, it starts tomorrow. I'm out all day tomorrow. That is so uncool. I hate to leave you like this without childcare, but you don't have a job. Okay, that sounded wrong. I know that you're busy volunteering. It's not the volunteering. It's all the shopping, it's spending hours in the farmers' market, it's finding the right foods for her, it's pureeing sweet potatoes, and I do all of this at the same time as I'm nursing. Maybe you should go back to work, too. Mothers need to work. It's actually better for the kid. And how would you know? Your key. There's no job more important than raising a child. Megan, please. Rachel! What are you doing? Give me my baby. Rachel, what are you doing? Hello? Thank you. Hmm. Beautiful. How many times has she texted you today? I don't know. She called the landline three times. Oh. You have to talk to her. I know. It's getting crazy. I will. I know, I know, I know. Okay. It's gonna be fine. Isn't it always fine? Don't I always make everything fine? Stop! Who gives a shit? It's your birthday. Are you sure you don't want me to take you out tonight? No, I like it at home. Call Megan. Ask her to come back. She just quit. She what? She just told me she got another job. Huh. Shame. I thought you guys were kind of a good team together. Mmm. So did I. - Hey, it's Tom. - Sorry I missed you. I'll get right back to you. Hey, Tom. It's me. Uh, I just wanted to wish Momma a happy birthday. - Happy birthday, Mom... - Rachel! Jesus. No,no,no. No, don't, Cathy. Please stop it. Relax. Cathy, come on! Relax! I just need some to go to sleep, that's all. I just need a little bit to go to sleep. What brought this on? He posted another picture of the baby. It was a cute picture. Yeah? Yup. Facebook and drunk ex-wives do not make good friends. I got it. I got it. All right. Let's get you to your room. Rachel, you have to stop calling them, okay? I really appreciate this room. I do. I thought that I would just be here for a couple of weeks or months. Yeah, that was two years ago. Get some sleep. IVF rarely works the first time. Would you like a moment? It's okay, sweetie. We're gonna try again. We can't afford to do it again. When we can, we will. I wonder what she's looking at. Or if she even sees this train at all. Who is that man? What is she doing? She's throwing it all away. TOM". Anna, I fell asleep last night thinking of you. I dreamed about kissing the inside of your thighs and holding your breasts. God, I wish I was fucking you right now. Anna, I love you. I love you so much. When it happened to me, I found dozens of e-mails. Tom told her that he'd never felt like this before. He said it wouldn't be that much longer until they were together. I know what they say. You shouldn't check his e-mail. I was stupid. But when I, um... When I saw it was from the realtor, I thought that it was just spam. And then I realized that they were kisses, not X's. And my husband was fucking a Century 21 agent. That sucks. It does. Her name was Anna Boyd and he was in love with her. Come here for one second. Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd," but just yell it, all right? Fuck you, Anna Boyd! Fuck you, Anna Boyd! That bitch is living in my house. I picked everything in that house. I picked everything. I picked the dining table, the kitchen table. I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at. I just wanna tell her. I wish I could tell her. I picked everything in that house. I fucking picked everything in that house. I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail. But this morning, I did. I did. When I saw that woman kissing someone else, just... Betraying her husband, I felt... I felt it. I felt pure rage. It was like something had been taken from me again. If I could... If I could, I'd just go to her house, and I'd go and find her sitting at the kitchen table, and I'd just... I'd wrap my hand in her long blonde hair and I'd jerk her head back. I'd justjerk it back, and then I'd pull her down to the ground, and I would just smash her head all over the floor! Move! Get out of my way! Move! Hey! Hey! You whore! Jesus Christ, Rachel. What the hell is wrong with you? I spent the past hour driving around looking for you. You scared the shit out of Anna. Do you know that? She thought you were gonna... She wanted to call the police. So just... Leave us alone. You can ruin your own life if you want to, but you're not gonna destroy ours. I'm not gonna protect you anymore. RACHEL". on, my God. Rachel? Open the door. Cathy, I just need a sec. Are you okay? Rachel, open the door. I have a stomach flu. Okay? I just... You don't have a flu. What the fuck, Rachel? I'm not stupid! Rachefl Cathy, just go away! - Come here for one second. - Just one second. Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd." Fuck you, Anna Boyd! Fuck you, Anna Boyd! You whore! No! Anyone counting days 1 to 90, who would like to share a day count? Hey, I'm Jason. I'm an alcoholic. Welcome, Jason. I've got 22 days back. Anyone else? Hi. I'm Rachel and... - Welcome, Rachel. - Hi, Rachel. Thank you. This is day one, I suppose. Um... I'm here because I... Becauselu. Because I woke up, um, covered in blood. And I had bruises all over my arm, um... It's usually from when I've fallen and someone's helped me up. My husband... He used to tell me what I'd done the night before. And I learned when you wake up like that, you just say you're sorry. You just say you're sorry for what you did, and you're sorry for who you are, and you're never gonna do it again. But you do. You do it again. And there's time missing. I need to remember. I need to remember. Okay. Thank you, Rachel. Thank you, Rachel. Right? It was that, um... The homeless thing. I don't remember what it was called. Oh, Safe Shelter. That was a tube top, right? Yep, it was. Why say, "Yes, I'm gonna go. "And I can't wait becauseifsfun to dress up." Then dress up. Do you like devil's eggs, Martha? Deviled eggs? Yeah, I do. Deviled eggs. Thank you for making them. The classics. Do you wanna try one, anybody? Those go outside. I don't want the eggs with the dessert. It doesn't fucking matter where they go, okay? So do you wanna put them here? Do you want them with your hot dogs? Or you can put a couple with your quinoa if you want to. Do you wanna put them with your other salad and your oorn? Rachel. Put a couple on the wall... Rachel! I'm fine, Tom! Stop it. You didn't back me up. You never have my back. You never have my back. That's my boss's wife. Probably got me fired back there. I don't give a fuck. I'm your wife. I'm your wife and you never... Rachel. You never fucking support me. Rachel, please stop it! Hey, come on! I need you to focus here. Don't fucking talk to me like that! Relax! Rachel. There you are. Cathy, I'm sorry. I need to get my shit together. You must be Ms. Watson. I'm Detective Riley. This is Detective Gaskill. We need to ask you a few questions. What's this about? Wanna sit down? Can you tell me where you were Friday night? I was at work in the city, and then... And then I went to visit my husband. You mean your ex-husband? Yeah. So I got off the train at Ardsley-on-Hudson, and then I decided that it was a bad idea. Around what time did you reach that conclusion? I was back here by 11:00. Yeah. Yeah. On your way back here, did you stop anywhere? No. And what time did you take the train there? Um, 6200. So, what'd you do during those hours in Ardsley, if you weren't seeing your ex-husband? Do you remember seeing this woman? She worked for your ex-husband. She's gone missing. What do you mean she's missing? Her husband said she never came back home the same night you got off the train in Ardsley-on-Hudson. I was just... Do you know Megan Hipwell? No! Did you see her? No, I don't think so. Isthatbecause you were inebriated? Just to clarify, you said you were at work Friday? Are you referring to your job in public relations? Right. It's my understanding you were fired from that job over a year ago because of your drinking problem. Okay. That's enough for now. If you're able to remember anything else, give us a call. Did you really get fired? Look, I didn't want you to worry that I couldn't pay the rent. If you don't have a job, then what do you do every day? I ride the train. You what? I ride the train to New York and back. That's what your alimony's paying for? Tickets to nowhere? That's really fucking weird, Rachel. Okay, Okay- I got on the train, and then I got off the train. I don't know. It's very unclear. You don't remember anything, do you? I read about this man in Long Island who blacked out. He left a bar... ...drove to the house that he'd grown up in, stabbed its occupants to death. He woke up the next morning oblivious to what he did, until the police came to get him. Rachel! What? What? You have to leave. I can't do this anymore. I'll give you a few weeks... Hold on. Hold on. Detective Riley? Yeah, I agree with you. Detective Riley? I saw someone with Megan Hipwell, but not on Friday night. She was having an affair. She had a lover. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I thought you didn't know her. No. But I saw her. You saw her where? I saw her from the train. She was standing on the deck with this man. With her husband, Scott Hipwell? No. It wasn't him. This man was different and they were kissing. Wow. That's pretty coincidental, isn't it? You just happen to be on a train at the same exact moment that a woman you don't know, but somehow recognize is cheating on her husband? I know it sounds crazy. Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the vicinity of her house Friday night. Megan Hipwell does bear a resemblance to Anna Watson. Mrs. Watson reported that you go to their house sometimes uninvited and that on one occasion, you actually broke in and took their child. Let me give you some advice. Don't go back to Beckett Road. Don't contact your ex-husband. Don't go anywhere near Anna Watson or her baby. Are you listening to me? Yes. You don't live there anymore. Stay away. You know, I lie all the time. I lie to Scott. I lie to you. I mean, I know that's not the point of therapy, butlhaveto keep things vague. Jumble up all the men, the exes, the lovers. It doesn't matter who they are. It matters how they make me feel. Lying is like taking a trip. It's like having a secret. It's like touching yourself and no one else knows. Except you. But you're just pretending. You're just pretending to touch yourself. Scott's possessive. Jealous. He likes to own me. He figures out all my passwords. Which is kind of sexy. So, when I came home last night, Scott was on my laptop, wondering why... Scott's behavior is not normal. It's a form of emotional abuse. Are you ever afraid of Scott? It's not abuse. Not if you don't care, and I don't. Maybe it's become a normal state for you. Is it normal I think about you all the time? "Almost exactly a week ago, "Megan Hipwell walked out of number 15 Beckett Road and disappeared. "No one has seen her since. "Neither her phone nor her bank cards have been used since Friday." "A wonderful woman, "an intensely private person with a warm heart. "She lost a brother when she was 16, "and both her parents died a few years ago. "Scott Hipwell urges anyone with information "to please come forward." You Megan's friend? Yes. Rachel. Come in. Do you want a coffee? Uh, sure. Thank you. Sorry, it's a mess. I've been hunting for her social, her birth certificate. The cops need a lot. Have we met somewhere before? I don't think so. And you know Megan from... Uh, from the gallery. Oh, you're an artist? Uh, well, I like to think so. So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan. What did you wanna tell me? I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning. With who? She was up there on your porch. Um... I saw her from the train, because I commute to Manhattan every day and I go straight past here. She kissed him. They were kissing. I'm sorry. I know this is a terrible thing to hear. Yeah. I know how it feels. Huh. What did he look like? He was average height. He had dark hair. And they were out there on the porch? Yes. Fuck! Fuck. Oh, no, no, no. Thank you. Okay, sure. It could... I don't know. Maybe it's a good thing. Could mean she's all right. She just ran off with someone. Right. Has she talked to you? Oh, no. Um, I haven't heard anything. You know her well enough to know where we live. Megan doesn't have many friends. Well, I used to live nearby, and, um, she and l... We took... We took... We took Pilates together. I think I should go. I feel like I've taken up too much of your time. So sorry to have had to tell you that in that way... Hey. Do you think you'd recognize him again if you saw him? I don't know. There's a guy. A therapist. His name's, um, Abdic... Um, Kamal Abdic. Is that who you saw? I don't know. I really can't tell. She spends a lot of fucking time with her shrink. RACHEL'. That's him. I remember. That's him. I remember. That's him. I'm sorry. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Stay away from me. This is so stupid. He makes every conversation about getting pregnant. And every time we go there... Where? To that subject. What subject? Megan? What subject? It's okay. Megan. Megan. All right, Megan. We shouldn't. No. Megan. Don't make it impossible for us to work together. Megan, I could lose my practice. I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck about your fucking practice! I don't give a... Dr. Kama! Abdic has been brought in for questioning on the disappearance of Ardsley-on-Hudson resident, Megan Hipwell. He was, according to sources, Mrs. Hipwell's psychiatrist. For the first time in ages, I have purpose. Or at least I have a distraction. I want Megan to show up safe and sound. I do. Yeah! Just not quite yet. Hi. What's wrong? Abdic's been released. What? There wasn't enough evidence. And because I'm the one that got him arrested, he talked. A lot. They'll build a case against him. It'll just take some time. Are you totally sure he's the guy you saw Megan with? Yes. You sure as fuck better be. I don't understand. The police think I did it. Yeah, but he's the one... He told them Megan's miserable. That I'm a jealous, controlling husband. I'm sure that they're just trying to rule you out. Abdic told them I'm abusive. When she walked out, I didn't go after her. InevercaHed to check on her. I went to a sports bar for fuck's sake. Got drunk. No. We just need to find more evidence on Abdic. I've spent the whole day going through her stuff. There's no e-mails, there's nothing. No letters, no e-mails. Nothing. For a second, lthoughtabout contacting Abdic: myself. Fucking phone won't stop! This is Scott. Yeah, yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Do you mind? Oh! Rachel, no. Ann, get in the house. Your wife hit me on Friday night. No. What are you talking about? Yes. Yes, you did. Yes, you did! And then she... She got in your car. No. She said you yelled at her that night. No. That is not what happened. She was in the tunnel and she hit me. I don't wanna argue on the street. It's the middle of the day and you're drunk. Look, I'm not drunk, Tom. My wife is scared of you. Of what? I don't even know if that's a joke or not. Let's start with child abduction. That's bullshit. You know that's not how it happened. You and I both know what you're capable of. Were you just at Scott Hipwell's house? Why are you at Scott Hipwell's house? Because I'm helping... I'm helping him. How? To try and find Megan. You don't even know Megan! Rash , I don't think you're helping anybody. So you're here because you want to uncover lost memories? - Is that correct? - You have an accent. Pardon? No. Sorry. I, um, wasn't expecting you to have an accent. Well, you have an accent. Where are you from? I'm American citizen. But I guess you're not here to talk about me. Unless you are. No. Sorry, I was just, uh, trying to make conversation. The blackouts. You're experiencing blackouts? Mmm-hmm. Do you wanna tell me about them? Mmm... Well, when I wake up, and when someone tells me what I've done, it just doesn't feel like me, or like something that I would do. I feel bad about it, but, um... But it's like it's so far removed that I have a... I just don't feel bad enough. You wanna take personal responsibility for what you've done, but you find it difficult to feel accountable because you can't even remember it. Yeah? Yeah. So, Rachel, besides drinking... Because you clearly drink. You've been drinking today, haven't you? What else do you enjoy? Do you have any hobbies? I like to draw. Art, I guess. Good. We can try to regain some of your memories by drawing them. I've tried it. It doesn't work. And have you ever tracked all the way back to when you started drinking heavily? When was that? It was with Tom. When I couldn't get pregnant. Who's Tom? He's my ex-husband. You wanna talk about that? I really wanted a baby. We tried everything and nothing worked. And it just absolutely... ltjust broke my heart and... So I got really sad. And then, um... And then the booze just broke us. Good. Tell me more. I used to watch this perfect couple. And they were just the embodiment of true love. It's like the kind of love you always want. And then she betrayed him. And it sparked something in me. Why are you really here, Rachel? Because I'm afraid of myself. July 5th. 1.'33 and 1.'34, 1.'37. She calls again, 1:38. And then she calls again at 1:44, 1:45, 2:15 p.m. And July 6th. You get the point. She sometimes texts him dozens of times a day. But these are all from an unknown number. Unknown is Rachel. You have a log of the calls. You don't have a log of what they're saying to each other. Look, um... Has she been back to the house since the incident with your child? Not that I know of. Then, you may have a case for harassment in the second degree. But these are texts, they're not threats. She has been hanging around Scott Hipwell's house. A lot. Yeah. I'm aware. There are a lot of loose ends here that suggest something, but they don't add up to much. If you could bring me something more solid... What more do you need? Evidence. Real evidence. You sure your husband doesn't wanna stay in touch with his ex-wife? What? No. She's harassing us. Is that what he calls it? Hi. H Y- e Hey- Hi. Reporters are in my yard. They're everywhere. I didn't know where else to go. Come in. The detective just... The detective just told me something I've wanted to hear for a long time. She's pregnant. She told her shrink but not me. I wanted a family. But she fought me every step of the way. We always fought about it. Did Megan ever say anything about me to you? She loved you. She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved. You shouldn't be here. I just... I need to tell someone. Just once. Just say it out loud. I wanna tell you. And then I'll be gone. I swear. I got pregnant. I was 17. I had her by myself. She had dark eyes and blonde hair. I expected it to be hard, but it wasn't. It was easy. Because I loved her. I loved her. We called her Elizabeth. Libby. Libby. It was December, and we had gotten in a fight, me and Mac. He'd gone off and left. The roof was leaking. It was freezing cold, so I got in the tub. I brought Libby in with me, put her on my chest. Her head just under my chin. I fell asleep. I let her go. I let her go. I let her go. I let her go. I couldn't look. I didn't wanna see it. I didn't wanna see her like that. I wrapped her in a blanket and I buried her. Mac went out that night. And he never came back. He never came back. I missed our home. So one day, when I was drunk, I decided to go there. The front door was open. It's not like I broke in. And then I heard Evie. ABDK)'. Who's Evie? Tom's baby. I know this sounds insane. But I just wanted to hold her. Just for a moment. Rachel! What are you doing? What are you doing? Rachel. Give her to me. Shh. Mommy's here. Shh. Shh. I wasn't going to hurt her. I would never hurt her. I just wanted to hold her. "Partially decomposed body found. "Female body found. Death a result of blunt force trauma. "Blunt force trauma. Partially decomposed body found. "Megan Hipwell. Blunt force trauma. Partially decomposed. "Investigation now being called a homicide. "Sources say the partially decomposed body found "is missing Ardsley woman, Megan Hipwell. "Death a result of blunt force trauma. "Megan Hipwell's investigation now being called a homicide." What's wrong? I'm sorry. This reminds me of when I used to watch you getting dressed before going back to her. Back to this house. I actually miss being the other woman. Did you enjoy cheating on Rachel? Seriously? Can we not fixate on her? I saw her again today. Where? This afternoon, when the police brought Scott baok home. She was across the street. And when she saw me, she got aggressive. Aggressive how? What if Rachel killed Megan? Rachel did not kill Megan. Then why is she creeping around Scott's house? She's dangerous and you know it. Anna. Anna. Sweetheart. Rachel is a sad person. She's completely harmless. What are you doing here? How did you get in? Come here. Have a beer with me. I'm not drinking right now. Detective Riley came to see me last night. And turns out, I'm not the father. Neither is the shrink. Did my wife confide in you about a third man? Sit down. Sit down! Look, I don't know what this is about. Oh, come on. You and Megan were such good friends. You must have known. Admit it. Admit what? Admit that you never even fucking met my wife. The detective said you didn't even know Megan. She used other words, too. Alcoholic. Maybe even mentally unstable. I am sorry. I was honestlyjust trying to help you. You're Tom's crazy ex. When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh? And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship? You'? I would never even get near someone like you! My wife is dead and you're lying to me! What's wrong with you? Who does this? I needed to tell you about Megan's affair, and you wouldn't have believed me if I was just Tom's ex! Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me. For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking! How are they going, huh? You know, the sessions. With the doctor. I wanted to know about Abdic and I went to him to help you. You're just a sad liar with no life. You're all liars. Please! God. Ineedto file a statement. Name? Rachel Watson. Pete, I got this. You wanted to file a statement? I'm listening. Scott Hipwell just assaulted me. You mean your new boyfriend, Scott Hipwell? No. We were just friends. But that's what you wanted, isn't it? You got him to stay overnight at your apartment, right? No, you need the context. I know the context. But what I'm trying to determine is when your obsession with Mr. Hipwell began. Was it before or after his pregnant wife was murdered? You were neighbors at one point. I met him after. After being questioned by me, you befriend another even more obvious suspect than yourself. And then you manage to get him to incriminate himself, all the while hoping he'll fuck you. I came here trying to help you. He just assaulted me in my own house! You were seen in the area that night. There are several hours that you say you can't aooount for. It was Scott. Scott Hipwell killed his wife. No, he didn't. Surveillance footage from a sports bar accounts for Mr. Hipwell's whereabouts that night. You're lying. You're lying. Tell me what happened. It's okay. Tell me. I don't know. Did you murder Megan Hipwell? Hi. I need to see you. Can you please come over? I can still see her dark eyes. I can smell her skin. I can feel how cold she was. Forgive yourself. You don't have to be afraid of being alone. You're not alone. You'll be fine. You and your baby will be fine. Why are you following me? Why are you here? I could ask you the same question. I saw you... I saw you that night inthetunneL I saw you there and... All right. I know I saw you there. Lady, I live here. I'm always in that tunnel. But what did you see? What happened that night? What did you see? All right. You, uh... You busted your ass. You fell. I felt sorry for you. I tried to help you up. You told me to fuck off, so I fucked off. Was I with anyone? Was I alone? Vvhathappened? I don't know. You were wasted. You're always wasted. That's all I can tell you. Whoa. Take it easy. I need you to tell me the fucking truth. What did you see that night? What happened that night? I don't know. I'm assuming it's the worst. God. - Come here for one second. - Just one second. Say "Fuck you, Anna Boyd." Fuck you, Anna Boyd! Fuck you, Anna Boyd! I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the... When I saw that woman kissing someone else, betraying her husband, I felt pure rage, If I could, I'd go to her house, I'd find her sitting there and... Smash her head all over the floor! RACHEL". Cathy, thank you for all you have done for me. I'm sorry to leave this way. I'll send for my things later. Love, Rachel. That is so true! It's the worst restaurant ever. Why do we keep going back? Martha? Martha. Rachel? I haven't seen you in a million years. Yeah, I wanted to call you. Um, but Tom said I should just leave it alone. Oh. Um... I'm so sorry. For what? For the barbecue, and I just need you to know that I don't remember anything, and, um, I just completely blacked out. Everyone had a little too much to drink, so it's okay. I know, but with the eggs, and then I screamed at you. That I was that abusive, I just feel... I just feel so ashamed about it. Um... I don't... Tom said that I smashed your plate. I don't... Tom was fired because of how I behaved. You felt sick and you took a nap in our guest bedroom. Do you wanna lie down? Come with me. Okay. Excuse us. Rachel, are you feeling better? You guys can stay the night if you want. No. That's fine. Thanks. Okay. I think I'd remember if you caused a scene. I'm so sorry. Get up. And then Tom took you home. I'm sorry, Tom. Stop fucking saying that! I know you're sorry! Sorry. What's your fucking problem? You can't even focus on me. Can't even fucking stand up! What is wrong with you? Can you stand? Fucking disgusting. No. No. Yeah. Tom got fired because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants. You did nothing wrong. Nothing. Wake the fuck up, Rachel! Wake the fuck up! Wake up! You can sleep out here. We all felt so bad for you. He's such a bad guy. Ugh,God. Are you okay? Hmm. I need to see you. Meet me at 3:00. I'm here. Where are you? I can't. I'm stuck watching Evie. What are you doing up? Picking up after Evie. You whore! Leave us alone. No new messages. No saved messages. To hear your current voicemail greeting, please press two. Hi, it's Megan. Leave a message. To replay this greeting, press one. Hi, it's Megan. Leave a message. You okay? I thought I heard something. You should wake me up if you heard something. I just... Come back to bed. Whore! Rachel's down there. What the hell are you doing? Come here. Hey, get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here! You're okay. You just need some help. Don't touch me. You just need to get a little help up. Just fuck off. Fuck off! Oh. Anna? No. Go away! Anna, please. Please. There's... Okay. Go! I'm gonna stand right here. I'm not gonna come closer. I just need to talk to you. I don't wanna hear anything you have to say. Where's Tom? He's lying to you. He always does. He's a good liar. I know he's a good liar. We went behind your back for months. He's just done it to you. I know he's cheating. I know. Anna, he killed Megan. No, we don't... We don't know that. He's dangerous. We don't know anything. Anna, you need to leave. You need to leave. No. No. You need to take Evie and you need to leave. No. Get out of here. It's not safe. I'm not leaving him. It's hardly the first time he's had an affair. It's not about the affair and you know that deep down. Anna, please, just come with me. I'm not leaving him. Please come with me. Anna, don't. Come in the house, honey. Please. I saw you, Tom. You motherfucker! I saw you, you murderer! You fucking murderer! You killed her! You fucking killed her! I know it! Un-fucking-believable! Listen to me. Megan got into his car that night. You think I don't remember. You thought I blacked out. I saw you. Why did Megan get in your car? Did Megan get in your car? No! Yes, she did! Tell her the truth. Just tell her the truth right now. You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you! I found Megan's phone. I found it. So all those phone calls, they weren't from Rachel. So were you fucking her while she was here working? While she was looking after our daughter? Yeah. You were so tired all the time and... It's all about Evie. That's right. It was all about you, wasn't it? Tom, give her to me. It's all right. It was all about you, wasn't it? Tom, give her to me. Please. Please give her to me. She's fine. I think she needs changing, please? She's gonna be fine. Please just give her to me. Shh. Lethergo. You're gonna hurt her. Change her here. Okay. I'll change her. Lethergo. You're gonna hurt her. Shh. - 911, what's your... What's your emergency? No. Stay. Stay. Do you need a drink? No. Yeah, you do. All those things that you said I did... Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them. You just watched me suffer. You made me feel so worthless. You made me think that everything was my fault. Drink it. You told me I got you fired. But I didn't. You know, I saw Martha on the train. Drink it! I saw Martha on the train, and she told me that you were fired because you were fucking everyone in the office! Shh. Rachel's down there. Wait here. Gonna get in the car? What's going on? Don't worry about it. Come on. Okay, I'm here. So what is it? I just wanna go to the woods. What is it with you crazy women? Is that what you want? No. Oh. Like this? What? I'm pregnant. Congratulations. I thought you should know. You thought I should know? There's a chance it could be yours. Then get an abortion. Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it. You can be as involved as you want. You're a shitty nanny. What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother? Why did you bring me there in the first place? Becauselthought it would be fun to have you both around. I played your game so you could fuck me in between Evie's playdates. I don't need another kid. Certainly not with you. I took care of your kid to be near you! You fucked Anna 'cause you couldn't fuck Rachel anymore, and you fucked me 'cause you couldn't fuck Anna. Take us all away and you're just a pathetic, impotent man. You're not gonna get rid of me. You're gonna pay for this child for the rest of your life. You're like a dog. Like one of those unwanted, mistreated dogs. And if you kick them, they keep coming back to you. Thinking that somehow if they're good... You're not doing this again. ...you'll love them. This is what you do. You're not doing this to me. You brought this on yourself, Rachel. If you'd just stayed away that one night... Just left us all alone... You brought this on Megan. In a way, you killed her. But I didn't. You did. No! And you did this to me in our marriage. You made me fucking crazy. Do you have any idea what it's like to be married to a fucking blur? I had no choice. He was... He would have killed me. I never wanted to hurt him. It was self-defense. She had no choice. Tom would have killed her. I saw the whole thing. Rachel was right about Megan. She was right about everything. We're tied forever now, the three of us. Bound forever by the story we share. Today, I sit in a different car and I look ahead. Anything is possible, because I am not the girl I used to be.
