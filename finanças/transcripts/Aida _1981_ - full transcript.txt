Yes, it is rumoured that the Ethiopian has dared to challenge us again, threatening Thebes and the valley of the Nile. Shortly a messenger will bring us the details. Have you consulted Holy Isis? She has named the supreme commander of the Egyptian armies. Oh, fortunate man! He is young and brave. Now I shall go to inform the King of the deity?s decree. If only that warrior were I! If my dream might come true! An army of brave men, led by me ? victory, and the applause of all Memphis! To return to you, my sweet Aida, decked with the victor?s laurels, to say. ?I fought, I won for you!? Heavenly Aida, divine form, mystic garland of light and flowers, you are the queen of my thought, you are the splendour of my life. That I might bring you once more the blue skies, the soft breezes of your native land, a royal crown to deck your brow, a royal throne for you, in the sun! Oh, heavenly Aida, divine form, mystic halo of light and flowers, you are the queen you are the splendour of my life. That I might bring you once more the blue skies, the soft breezes of your native land, a royal crown to deck your brow, a royal throne for you, in the sun! What rare joy shines on your face! What noble pride flashes in your eyes! How enviable indeed would be that woman whose beloved face might kindle so joyful a light in you! My heart was lost in an adventurous dream. Today the goddess has named the warrior who will lead the Egyptian legions into battles. Ah! if I were chosen for such an honour... Was it not perhaps some greater, sweeter dream which spoke to your heart? Have you no desires, no hopes, here in Memphis? I! (What an interrogation! Perhaps she has discovered the secret love which burns in my heart... (Oh, woe if love for another should burn in his heart! perhaps she has read in my thoughts her slave-girl?s name!) Woe to him if my eyes should see through this fatal mystery! perhaps she has read in my thoughts It is she! He is moved! The glance with which he looked at her! Aida! Could it be she who is my rival? Come, my child, come near me. You are neither slave nor handmaiden here, where for love of you I have called you sister. You weep? Tell me the reason for your tears, tell me your secret. Alas, I have heard the frightful war cry sounds. I fear for my country, for myself, for you. Is this true? No greater care disturbs you? Ah! Tremble, evil slave, tremble! Let me sound your heart! Tremble, for the truth is clear to me when I see your tears, your blushes! Woe if our secret love she should ever read in our hearts! Tremble, for the truth is clear to me when I see your tears, your blushes! No, not only for my country is my heart in anguish; the tears I shed are the tears of unhappy love! High reasons of state have led me to summon you, O faithful Egyptians. A messenger has arrived from Ethiopia. He brings grave tidings. Hear them now. Let the messenger come forward. The sacred soil of Egypt has been invaded by the fierce Ethiopian. Our fields have been laid waste, our crops burned. Spurred on by this easy victory, the foe is marching now on Thebes. They dare to do this! A fierce, relentless warrior heads them ? Amonasro! The King himself! My father! Thebes, already in arms, will fall upon the barbarian invader from her hundred gates, spreading war and death. Yes! Let war and death be our battle cry! War! War! etc. Tremendous, pitiless war! Holy Isis has already named the leader of our invincible legions: Radames! Radames! -Ah! praised be the gods! He, the leader! My prayers are answered! I am afraid! Go now, O warrior, to the Temple of Vulcan. There put on the sacred arms; go forth to victory! Onward! Go forth, Egyptian heroes, to the sacred banks of the Nile. From every heart let the cry sound out ? War and death, death to the invader! Glory to the gods! Let all remember, it is they who rule our destinies. Only the power of the gods can dictate the warrior?s fate. Onward! May our breasts be a fortress shielding the sacred banks of the Nile. Let no cry sound but our united cry, War, war and death to the invader! etc. -For whom do I weep? For whom do I pray? What power binds be to him A sacred thrill of glory runs through my heart. I must love him, yet he is, the enemy of my country! Onward, let us hasten to victory! War and death to the invader! Accept, O leader, from my hands this glorious banner; may it be as a light and a guide on the road to victory. Death to the invader! yet he is, the enemy of my country! War! War! Onward, let us hasten to victory! Return victorious! Return victorious! My lips have spoken the traitorous words! Victorious over my father, who takes up arms for me, to give me again a country, a kingdom and a great name, which here I must hide. Victorious over my brothers ? that I may see him, stained with the beloved blood, welcomed in triumph by Egypt! And behind his chariot, a King. My father, in chains! My mad word, O gods, efface! Send back this child to her father?s heart. Destroy the legions of our oppressors! Ah! Wretched girl, what have I said? And my love? Can I, then, forget this burning love, which, as a wretched slave, I welcome in rapture like a ray of the sun? Shall I invoke death upon Radam?s, him whom I love so much? Ah, never on earth has a broken heart known such anguish! The sacred words father and lover ? I can no longer speak them, nor remember. For each, in my fear and confusion, I should like to pray, to weep. But my prayer changes to cursing ? tears, for me, are criminal; My mind is lost in a bitter night, and in such cruel anguish I wish to die. Oh! gods, have pity on my suffering! There is no hope for my sorrow! Fatal love, fearful love, break my heart and let me die! Oh! gods, have pity on my suffering! Mighty, mighty Phtha, life-giving spirit of the world, ah! We invoke thee! Thou, who from nothingness didst draw the seas, the earth, the heavens, we invoke thee! Great, great Phtha, fruitful spirit of the world, ah! We invoke thee! We invoke thee! Uncreated, eternal flame, which sparked the sun, ah! we invoke thee! Life of the Universe, mythus of eternal love, we invoke thee! Great Phtha! We invoke thee! Great Phtha! We invoke thee! O youth beloved of the gods, you hold in trust the destiny of Egypt. May the sacred sword, tempered by the gods, become in your hand blazing terror and death for the enemy. May the sacred sword, tempered by the gods, become in your hand blazing terror and death for the enemy. O god, custodian and avenger of this sacred land, lift thy hand over the land of Egypt O god, leader and judge of every earthly battle, protect thou, defend thou O god, leader and judge of every earthly battle, protect thou, defend thou the sacred soil of Egypt! Great Phtha! Great Phtha! creator of the world life-giving spirit of the world who from nothingness didst draw the seas, the earth, the heavens, Great Phtha! O hero, who, to the sounds of hymns and praise, set forth on the flight to glory, like some god of terror, blazing like the sun, come, on your head shall shower the blossoms won from the laurel, and together the songs of glory shall sound with the songs of love. Ah, come, my love, bring madness and blessed peace to my heart! Now where are the barbaric hordes of the mighty invader? Like mist, they faded away at the first breath of our champion. Come, victorious warrior, come take the prize of glory; victory has smiled upon you, on you love too shall smile. Ah, come, my love, give new life to me, once more, with the words of love! come, on your head shall shower the blossoms won from the laurel, and together the songs of glory shall sound with the songs of love. Ah, come, my love, give new life to me, once more, with the words of love! Silence! Aida is coming. Child of the vanquished, grief is sacred. Seeing her now, the fearful doubt awakens in me again now I shall penetrate this fatal secret! The fortunes of war have gone against your people! Poor Aida! Your heart?s grief I share with you. I am your friend. You shall have whatever you wish from me. You shall be happy. Can I be happy, far from my homeland, knowing nothing of the fate of my father and my brothers? I weep for you. But there are limits to earthly sorrow. Time will quiet the anguish of your heart and, more than time, a powerful god Love! Love, love! Tormenting joy, sweet rapture, cruel anxiety! In thy sorrow I find my life, Ah, her pallor, her confusion in thy smile, I find heaven itself./ betray the secret fever of love! In thy sorrow I find my life, in thy smile, I find heaven itself. I fear to question her, for I share the anxiety of her heart! What new anguish disturbs you, sweet Aida? Tell me your secret, trust in my friendship. Among those brave men who fought and conquered your homeland, was there perhaps one whom you loved? What do you mean? Not to all has fate been cruel, since our fearless leader has died on the battlefield ? What did you say? Oh! wretched! Yes, Radam?s was killed by your people... Alas! And can you weep? I shall never cease my weeping! The gods have avenged you! The gods have always been against me. Tremble! I have read your heart ? you love him ? I! Do not lie! One more word and I shall know. Look into my eyes, I deceived ? Radam?s alive! Alive! Oh, praised be the gods! And you still hope to lie to me? Yes, you love him! But I too love him, do you hear? I am your rival, I, daughter of the Pharaohs! My rival! Then so be it, for I too am... Ah,what am I saying? Have pity on me; forgive me, ah! Let pity for my sorrow move you. It is true, I love him deeply. You are happy, you are powerful, in my life there is nothing but my love! Fear me now, you slave! Let your heart break; this love can mean your death. I am master of your fate, and my heart rages with hate and vengeance! You are happy, you are powerful, Fear me now, you slave! in my life there is nothing but my love! Let your heart break; Have pity! Have pity on me; Onward!May our breasts be a fortress shielding In the Triumph now being made ready, hurry at the sacred banks of the Nile! you shall take part with me. O slave! Let no cry sound but our united cry, You, prostrate in the dust, war and death to the invader! I at the King?s side, on the throne! Ah, have pity! What is left for me? My life is a desert. Live, reign ? soon I shall appease your anger. This love which distresses you will die with me, in the tomb. Come, follow me. You shall see if you are worthy to do battle with me, Ah, have pity, This love which distresses you will die with me, in the tomb. You shall see if you are worthy to do battle with me! O gods, take pity on my suffering! There is no hope for my sorrow! O gods, take pity on my suffering! Glory to Egypt and to Isis, protectress of the sacred land! To the King who rules the Delta joyful hymns we sing! Glory Glory to the king! Weave the lotus and the laurel into a crown for the victors! Let a soft cloud of flowers veil the steel of their arms. Let us dance, Egyptian maidens, the mystic dances, as, around the sun, the stars dance in the sky! Lift your eyes to the gods, the arbiters of victory; give thanks to the gods To the King who rules the Delta joyful hymns we sing! ...as, around the sun, the stars dance in the sky! Come, o, conquering hero, come, rejoice with us. At the feet of our heroic warriors we cast our flowers and laurel leaves. To the gods, supreme arbiters... Give thanks to the gods on this happy day Glory! Give thanks to the gods come, rejoice with us. Glory! Glory to Egipt! Saviour of the fatherland, I salute you. Come, receive from my daughter?s hand the triumphal wreath. Now ask of me whatever you will. Nothing shall be denied you on this day ? I swear it by my crown, by the sacred gods. Before I reply, let the prisoners be brought before you. Give thanks to the gods on this happy day What do I see? He? My father! Her father! In our power! You! A prisoner! Do not betray me. Come here. Now, who are you? Her father. I too fought. We were conquered. I sought death in vain. This uniform is witness that I defended my King and my country. Fate was our enemy, our courage was in vain. In the dust at my feet lay my King, dead of his wounds. If love of one?s country is a crime, then we are all guilty, and ready to die. But you, O King, are a mighty lord. Look with mercy on these captives. Today we are laid low by fate: tomorrow, such might be your lot. But you, O King, are a mighty lord/ Yes, we are laid low by the gods, Look with mercy on these captives./ and we beseech your mercy upon us. Today we are laid low by fate/ Ah, may you never have to suffer tomorrow, such might be your lot/ what today we are suffering! Destroy, O King, these ferocious slaves, close your heart to their traitorous pleas, Have mercy! the gods have condemned them to die, let the will of the gods be done! Have mercy! Have mercy! Have mercy! Now that fortune smiles upon us, let us be merciful towards our victims. The grief which speaks through her eyes makes her lovelier still in my sight. We beseech your mercy Each tear of my beloved?s eyes deepens my love for her. How he looked upon her! What flames light up their eyes! And I ? alone, abject, repulsed? Vengeance cries out in my heart. But you, O King are a mighty lord Look with mercy on these captives! The gods have condemned them to die, let the will of the gods be done! Put them to death! To death! Destroy, O King, this rabble! O King, you swore in he name of the gods, and by the splendour of your crown. You swore to grant me my wish. I have sworn. Then, for the Ethiopian prisoners I ask you for life, for freedom Death to the enemy! Mercy on the wretches! Hear me, O King. You too. youthful hero, hear my wise counsel. They are the enemy and they are brave. Their hearts are eager for revenge. Encouraged by our mercy, they will take up arms again! If Amonasro, the warrior king, is dead, they can no longer hope to fight us. At least, as a pledge of peace, let Aida, with her father, remain with us. I yield to your good counsel. And now I give you a greater pledge of peace; Radam?s, the fatherland owes everything to you. The hand of Amneris shall be you reward. One day, with her, you shall rule over Egypt. Let the slave try to steal my love ? if she dares! Glory to Egypt and to Isis, protectress of the sacred land. Weave the lotus and the laurel into a crown for the victor! Glory to merciful Egypt, which has dissolved our bonds, which sends us once again to the free fields of our native land! Let us sing hymns to Isis, protectress of the sacred land. Let us pray that the fates may be forever auspicious to our nation What hope now is left to me? For him ? glory and the throne, for me ? oblivion ...and the tears of a hopeless love! I am intoxicated with unforeseen joy; in one single day, all the dreams of my heart have come true The lightning of an enemy god has struck me. Ah, no, the throne of Egypt is not worth Aida?s heart Be brave, wait patiently for happier days for our land. For us the day of revenge is already dawning. What an unlooked-for blow has fallen upon my head! For me ? oblivion and the tears of a hopeless love.. Glory to Egypt and to Isis, protectress of the sacred land! Weave the lotus and the laurel into a crown for the victor! O thou, eternal mother and spouse of Osiris, goddess, who dost awaken the chaste fire in human hearts, succour us in thy mercy, O mother of infinite love! help us. Come to the temple of Isis, to beseech the Goddess?s favour on the eve of your wedding. Isis reads in the hearts of mortals; every human mystery is known to her. Yes, I shall pray that Radam?s give me his whole heart, as my heart is given in sacred love, forever, to him. Let us go. You will pray until dawn. I shall stay with you. Succour us in thy mercy, O mother of infinite love! O mother of infinite love! Succour us in thy mercy, Radam?s will come here. What will he say? I tremble. Ah! if you come, cruel man, to bid me a last farewell, in the dark eddies of the Nile I shall find my tomb, perhaps peace ? but at least, oblivion! O fatherland, I shall never see you again! O blue skies, soft breezes of my homeland, where I lived out the quiet morning of my life, O grassy hills, O fragrant streams, O fatherland, I shall never see you again! etc. O cool valleys, blessed, peaceful haven, one day promised me by love, now that the dream of love is gone, O fatherland, I shall never see you again! O fatherland, I shall never see you again! Heaven! My father! A grave matter has brought me here, Aida. Nothing escapes my eyes. Love for Radam?s is killing you. He loves you too. You are waiting for him. The daughter of the Pharaohs is your rival Princess of a hated race, our deadly enemy. And I am in her power! I, the daughter of Amonasro! In her power! No! if you wish, you can defeat your powerful rival, and fatherland, throne and love will all be yours. You will see again our fragrant forests, the cool valleys and the golden temples. I shall see again our fragrant forests, the cool valleys and the golden temples Happy bride of the one you love, you shall know great joys at last. One day of such enchantment, one hour of such great joy ? then I can die! You have not forgotten that pitiless Egypt defiled our altars, temples and homes, carrying off our maidens in slavery, murdering our mothers, our old men and our children? Ah, I remember well those unhappy days, and the mournful sorrow which filled my heart! Ah, grant, O gods, that for us may return Remember... the dawn of this peaceful days for which we pray. ...It cannot be long delayed. Our people even now are ready for battle; all is prepared, and we shall conquer. One thing is lacking ? for me to know the route that the enemy will follow. Who could find out? Who? You could! I! I know you are waiting for Radam?s. He loves you. He is the Egyptian captain. Do you understand? A horrid thought! What are you asking of me? No, never! Arise then soldiers of Egypt! Sack and burn our cities! Spread terror, rape and death! There is no rein now to your fury! Ah, father! father! You call yourself my daughter!Have pity! Waves of blood are flowing over the vanquished cities. See ? from the black swirls the dead arise. They point at you and cry, ?Because of you, our country dies!? Have pity! Father, have pity! A horrid spectre rises in the shadows before us. Tremble, for over your head it lifts its bony arms. Ah! father! no! have pity! It is your mother See her, she is cursing you! Ah! Have pity! Have pity! You are not my daughter! You are the slave of the Pharaohs! Ah! Ah! Have pity! Have pity! Father, I am not their slave. Do not curse me nor revile me you will call be daughter again, for I shall be worthy of my country. Remember that a whole people, conquered and suffering, can rise again through you! O fatherland, what a price I must pay, for thee! Be brave! He is coming now. I shall hear all. At last I am with you, again, sweet Aida. Stop go away! What do you want from me? At last I am with you, again, sweet Aida. But the rites of another love await you. Married to Amneris ? What are you saying? You, Aida, are the only one I can love. As the gods are my witness, you shall be mine. Do not break your oath! As a hero I loved you, if you swear false, I cannot. Do you doubt my love, Aida? But how can you escape from Amneris? wiles, from the King?s command, from the people?s will, from the wrath of the priests? Hear me, Aida Ethiopia has awakened, eager for fierce, new battles. Your people have already invaded, and I shall lead the Egyptians again. Then, in the midst of the triumph, kneeling before the King, I shall open my heart. You shall be my victor?s wreath; and we shall live, blessed by undying love. And do you not fear Amneris?s wrath? Her vengeance, like a thunderbolt, will strike me, my father and my people. I shall defend you. It would be in vain. Yet, if you love me, there is still an escape for us. What is it? To flee. To flee! Let us flee from the scorching sun of this desert land. A new fatherland reveals itself to our love. There, in the virgin forests, fragrant with sweet flowers, we shall forget the world in blessed joy. You asked me to flee with you to a foreign land? To abandon my fatherland and the altars of our gods? This land where I first plucked the flowers of glory, this land where first we loved ? how can we forget it? Beneath my country?s freer skies it will be granted to us to love. There, in the same temples we shall worship the same gods, How could I forget the sky which has been the first to witness our love? Let us flee ! - Aida! You do not love me ? go! Not love you! No man, no god has ever burned with such a love! Go, go ? Amneris is waiting for you at the altar No, never! Never, you say? Then the headman?s axe will fall on me, on my father... Ah no! Let us flee together. Yes, let us flee, far from these walls, let us flee, together, to the desert. Here there is nothing but misfortune, there we shall find a heaven of love, the never ending desert will be our wedding-bed, the stars will shine upon us with a purer, brighter light! In the happy land of my fathers, heaven awaits us. There the breeze blows sweet over that perfumed land of flowers. Cool valleys and green fields will be our wedding-bed. The stars will shine upon us with a purer, brighter light! Come with me, we shall flee together, from this land of sorrow. Come with me, I love you, and love shall be our king. But tell me ? how can we avoid the Egyptian legions? The route by which my men will march against the enemy will be free until tomorrow. And that route is? The pass of Napata. The pass of Napata! My men will be there! Who has overheard us? The father of Aida, the king of Etiopia. You! Amonasro! You ? the King! O gods!What have I done? No, it cannot be, it cannot be! I dream, I am raving mad! Ah no! Be calm. Listen to me,trust my love. Aida?s love for you will build you a throne! I am dishonoured! Dishonoured! For you I have betrayed my country! Be calm... No, you are not guilty. it was the will of Fate. I am dishonoured! Dishonoured!- Ah, no! - No! For you I have betrayed my country! Come ? beyond the Nile my brave and faithful men are waiting. There, love shall fulfil the wishes of your, heart. Come! Traitor! My rival! You have come to defeat my plans. You shall die! Stop, madman! - Oh, fury! Guards, look out Quickly! flee! Come, my daughter. Priest, I am in your hands. My hated rival has escaped. Radam?s awaits, from the hands of the priests, the traitor?s punishment. But he is not a traitor, even if he revealed the secret plan. He meant to flee ? with her! Traitors all! Death to them ? death! Oh, what am I saying? I love him, I still love him, with a mad, a desperate love, which is killing me. Oh! if only he might love me! I should like to save him. How? I shall try! Guards, bring Radam?s to me. The priests even now are in counsel, deciding you fate. But you can still establish your innocence in answer to the dread accusations. Clear yourself, and I shall ask pardon for you from the King. In that way, I can bring both pardon and life to you. The judges shall never hear me try to defend myself. Before the gods and man I feel myself neither traitor no guilty. My incautious words revealed the secret, it is true. But both my thought and my honour remain unstained by guilt. But both my thought and my honour remain unstained by guilt. No. You will die! Life is hateful to me! The source of all joy is now dry, every hope is gone. I wish only to die. To die! Ah, you must live! Yes, you shall live in my love. For you, I have already felt the horrible anguish of death. I loved, I suffered, I passed the nights in tears. My country, my throne, my life I should give up all for you. For her, I too betrayed my country and my honour. Do not speak of her! Infamy is my lot ? and you ask me to live? You brought me to the depths of misery, you took Aida from me. Perhaps, because of you, she is dead ? and you offer me my life? Aida dead, because of me? No, she is alive! She is alive! In the desperate flight of the fleeing hordes only her father died.. And she? She disappeared, nothing is known of her. May the gods lead her safely to her home. May she never know the fate of the one who will die for her! If I save you, swear to me that you will never see her again. I cannot! If you renounce her forever, you will live! I cannot! Once more ?renounce her. It is in vain. Madman ? you insist on dying? I am ready to die! Who will save you, wretch, from the fate which awaits you? You have changed into hatred a love which had no equal. Only heaven can now avenge my tears. Death is the greatest good, if I may die for her; In going to meet my fate my heart will know great joy; Only heaven can now avenge my tears. I have no fear of mortal wrath, your pity is the only thing I fear Alas! I shall die! Oh, who will save him? And it was I who cast him into their hands! Now I curse my jealously, which brought his death and eternal mourning in my heart! Ah, there they are ? the pitiless ministers of death! Oh, may I not see them, these white-robed ghouls! And it was I who cast him into their hands it was I who cast him into their hands! it was I who cast him into their hands! Spirit of the gods, descend upon us! Let thy eternal ray enlighten us; let our lips pronounce thy justice. O gods, take pity on my anguished heart! He is innocent ? save him, O gods! My grief is desperate, overwhelming! Spirit of the gods... Oh, who will save him? I shall die! ...descend upon us! who will save him? I shall die! Radames! Radames! Radames! You revealed your country?s secrets to the enemy! Defend yourself. Defend yourself. He is silent. Traitor! Ah, pity! He is innocent! Pity! O gods! Radames! Radames! Radames! You deserted your command on the eve of battle. Defend yourself. Defend yourself. He is silent. Traitor! Ah, pity! Ah, save him! Pity, O gods! Radames! Radames! Radames! You betrayed your country, your King, your honour. Defend yourself. He is silent. Traitor! Ah, save him! Pity, O gods! Radam?s, your fate is decided; you shall die a traitor?s death. Beneath the altar of the offended god, you, living, shall be entombed. Entombed alive! Oh, the villains! their thirst for blood is never appeased yet they call themselves heaven?s ministers! Traitor! Priests ? you have committed a crime! Infamous, bloodthirsty beasts ? you outrage the gods and man, punishing the innocent! He is a traitor! He shall die. Priest, this man whom you send to death, you know well, I once loved. The curse of a broken heart, together with his blood, will fall upon you! He is a traitor! He shall die. You outrage the gods... Ah, he is no traitor...have mercy He is a traitor! He shall die.- Ah, no, no... He is a traitor! He is not! He is a traitor! He shall die. He is not a traitor! Have pity! Traitor! Traitor! Impious brood! My curse upon you! Heaven?s vengeance will strike you! My curse upon you! The fatal stone has closed above me. This is my tomb. Never again shall I see the light of day, nor see Aida. Aida ? where are you? May you at least live happily, never knowing My horrid fate. A sigh? A ghost, a vision ? no, this is a human form! Heaven ? Aida! Yes, I. You, in this tomb! In my heart, I sensed your fate. Secretly I came into this tomb opened to receive you. And here, far from every human eye, I have chosen to die with you! To die ? so pure, so lovely! To die, for love of me! In the flowering of your youth, to give up your life! Heaven created you for love, yet I in loving you have killed you! No, you shall not die! I have loved you too much, you are too lovely to die! See? The angel of death, with shining wings, comes near, to bear us to eternal joys upon his golden wings. Above us heaven is opening. There, every sorrow ends, and there joy begins, the joy of immortal love. Great Phtha,life-giving spirit of the world, ah! How sad a song! The joy of the priests! Nor does my strength suffice to move thee, O fatal stone! It is useless! ...We invoke thee!- Our funeral hymn. On earth, all is finished for us. It is true! O Earth, farewell ? farewell, vale of tears, dream of joy which vanished into sorrow. Heaven opens to us, our wandering souls fly fast towards the light of eternal day, O Earth, farewell ? farewell, vale of tears, dream of joy which vanished into sorrow. Heaven opens to us, our wandering souls fly fast towards the light of eternal day, Mighty Phtha! O Earth, farewell! Farewell, vale of tears, Farewell, vale of tears, I pray for thy peace...beloved, lifeless body; Heaven opens to us... May Isis, placated, receive you into Heaven! ...our wandering souls fly fast towards the light of eternal day Heaven opens to us... Peace, I implore of you! Peace, peace, peace! Peace, I implore of you! Peace, peace, peace!
