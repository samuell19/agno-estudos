THE ANTENNA Low temperatures across the country are to decline further. Many showers are expected in the upcoming days. Authorities are warning citizens, against possible flooding. Now we proceed to the important news of the day. With the efforts of the Ministry of Telecommunication, our country is entering a new era. This new technology, which will firstly be utilized by state channels, allows shared usage of common satellites in apartment buildings. Assuming the project goes as planned, each residential unit will have access to a central broadcast system before summer. With the implementation of the new system, regulations and programs will be broadcasted first handedly and regularly, via daily bulletins. Today will be the starting point of this long planned system. Authorities report that the system will start a new era, which will result in radical changes. Of all days to be late, you pick today Mehmet. Is this how you roll? I am so sorry, Mr. Cihan. What did you need? This is Sait from the municipal office, he will install our satellite dish. Give him the key to the roof, so he can start immediately. I will be off then. Sait, once you're done, check the signal reception. Let's not have to do it again. Of course Mr. Cihan, I will check. I submitted the application three months ago. They put us in queue. Otherwise, we would've waited a lot longer. I heard it on the radio this morning, they say there will be broadcast all day. Not yet, but the bulletins start today. We will not have missed it. So you'll be watching? Of course. Well done, you've dressed the part. Thank you, I'm trying to put in effort. Well done. But Mehmet... ...Mr. Firat saw you dozing off again the other night. -He must have seen wrong, Mr. Cihan. -So, the man's a liar? No, that is not what I meant. Look, this doziness issue really gets on my nerves. As a superintendent, in these instances, people are holding me responsible. Plus, I'm the one who hired you, you know. You're right. It's always me, dealing with it all. I will be keeping a close eye on you. Beware. I'm very sorry Mr. Cihan, it won't happen again. You're right, it won't. Anyway, come on. Don't be sad. Things like this happen, Cemile. Come on, go home. Yusuf is alone. Alright. What do they say? They just checked the roof. A few bricks fell off. They ruled it off as a workplace accident. Apparently, they see a lot of these lately. Pity. People work so carelessly. Yes, out of nowhere, more stuff for us to deal with. It seems he was all alone. They couldn't reach any of his relatives. Because of that, I had to sign the papers. That is so sad. How is Mrs. Cemile? A bit scared, but she'll pull through. I sent her home to cool off with the kid. Good thinking. I wonder if the guy managed to install the satellite dish. Mehmet... ...what happened? The man installing the dish fell off. He was from the municipal office. What a pity. Mehmet, my bathroom is a complete mess. Something black is dripping from between the tiles, it is unusable. If I give the keys, will you check it out? I will, sure. But do it today, I need it ready by tonight. Don't worry, I'll take care of it shortly. Okay, thank you. Mehmet! Mehmet! Yes ma'am? There's no TV reception, can you take a look? Yes ma'am, right away. Low temperatures across the country are to decline further. Many showers are expected in the upcoming days. Authorities are warning citizens... "Important Announcement! The midnight bulletin is at 00:00" "The new broadcasting system kicks off today" I heard some voices coming from there. They're installing the new system. An official arrived. I gave him the key to the rooftop. A little after that, he fell down. -Did he die? -He did. Was he young? Sort of. Maybe he's better off. The guy got out on time. Now they'll go on and on about it all day. Yes dear viewers... ...it is now eight in the morning. The weather is cloudy and cold. You woke up to a shitty day again. Do not forget to be thankful for yet again being condemned to sorrow and watching us. It will get worse, Mr. Cihan told me. The bulletins are starting today. Forget that guy. He's a sick jerk. They keep telling you to work for him, right? Don't get me started. I told you, forget that guy. How's your sleep? Same. At home, I can't get a tiniest bit of sleep. I sometimes involuntarily doze off, that's all. You're rotting in that booth. Aren't you tired of it all? One also gets used to rotting. I also like the silence, you know. Your parents are going out tomorrow evening, right? Yeah. Mehmet? It's time, the train leaves tomorrow evening. Come on, take it. Are you sure? They'll come after you. Doesn't matter, I'll say I don't know anything. They won't leave you alone, you know. What can they do? -What will you do? -Never mind me. -Come with me. -I said never mind. I will live the same life, wherever I go. Take it, come on. Yes, dear viewers, our quiz contest continues. Our word contains eight letters. The state of being able to do what one wants, within the decision cycle, without any hindrance. Yes, dear viewers, our last three letters are revealed. Our word ends with the letters I, T and Y. Yes, we have Mr. Kemal on the line. Let's have the answer, Mr. Kemal. Hello, I'm telling you my answer. It's "Activity". Unfortunately, this answer is not correct Mr. Kemal. Yes, you still have the chance to win a brand new television, dear viewers. I repeat, the state of being able to... Hello? Yes, of course it is on, sir. I am waiting for the bulletin to start. No issues whatsoever. Of course, everyone was informed about the midnight bulletin. They will be waiting. I personally watch. Thank you. Yes. Yes, you are absolutely right. Indeed, an unpleasant event did take place. But we handled it. Do not worry. Thank you. We hope so, too. Have a good day, Sir. Yes, another viewer is on line. Ms. Gulsah, we are listening. Ms. Gulsah, your answer please. Well, umm... Yes, go ahead. "Immunity." Unfortunately, this answer is also not correct, Madam. Yes dear viewers, we are taking a break for the noon bulletin. Please enjoy. Yasemin. This bird... ...when did we get it, do you recall? I don't know, it's been here since I was born, Dad. So, you don't recall. You were little. It's been 14 years. When it first arrived,... ...you used to watch it for hours. You always wanted us to set it free, so it could fly. What happened then, do you remember that? I don't remember, Dad. You took it out of this cage, one day. You left the window open. It flew around a bit. Wandered around the room. It then, perched on the balcony. Singing loudly as ever. Then a crow... ...broke its wing. You cried for days. Yasemin! Come on dear, come set the table. Not on the top, it will crumble. Take two and put them on the side. If you put them on the supports, it will be solid. -This way? -Well done. In life you should... ...always be safe than sorry. What does that mean? It means you should be cautious. Dad? Yes? Why are you at home in the mornings, now? Because, that's how it needs to be. Hakan come on, it's Yusuf's bedtime. -It went down, game over son. -You ruined it! That's how it is, come on. Good night, son. Good night, Dad. Dad! It's nothing. The noise is coming from the pipes. Come on, go to sleep. Welcome to our youth elixir application tutorial.

Someone died in the building this morning. What? I heard. Who died? Why have I not heard? The man installing the satellite dish jumped off the roof. His brains were scattered everywhere. They were still collecting his parts... We're eating, Yasemin! Don't mess with our appetite! Anyway... ...let's move onto the real issue. I spoke with Mr. Cihan. You know I don't want to, Dad. I already said okay. Dad. The man works for the state. You'll be at the same place every day. No muss, no fuss. I don't want to have to worry about you. If you say so, Dad. Your dad is right. Give it a go, maybe you'll have a change of heart. Yeah right Mom, I sure will. Firat? Dad? What is it Firat, are you alright? I know you're upset, but... ...how did it go? Well, they made me wait for hours. Then a young man came, asked me two questions and sent me off. If you want, I can start working again. Mehmet says he knows someone. What will Yusuf do home alone? We'll leave him with my parents. They're already sold on it. A child apart from his mom, no way. I talked to Mr. Cihan, my name is listed in the institution. The state won't leave me high and dry, don't worry. It's been months Hakan, soon we'll be struggling. My parents also keep asking. What the hell are they asking? What are they asking? Who took care of you for years? I'm out of work for a bit and they start riding my back! Don't get mad, they're just worried. They want what's best for their grandson. Their grandson is my son! Can I not keep a job, did I not take care of you all these years? Enough! Drop it. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Are you alright, Yusuf? It's okay son, I'm here now. Mom, the noise. What noise, son? There's nothing here. Come on, scoot over, I'll lie next to you. Who's there? Hey! Mehmet! Answer me. Answer me! Are you damn asleep? I'm here, Mr. Cihan. Where the hell were you? I've been calling to you. Get the flashlight and keys, meet me at the boiler room. -Hurry up, I'm heading down. -I'll be there right away. The radiators are not working. Open the door, let's see what it is. God damn it! The boiler blew up. Take off your clothes. You'll go in and take a look. Mr. Cihan. I said take them off, come on! I'm going up. You go in, take a good look. See what's what. Don't say a word to anyone but me. Only hours left to the midnight bulletin. The eager anticipation continues. The first mass broadcast will take place with our leader. State officials expect high participation from citizens. Mehmet! What the hell, have you gone mad? The boiler blew up. I cut the mains water. Yeah, so? What are you doing now? There were whispers coming from below. This morning they were coming from the satellite dish. And the man died. That's ridiculous. What's that have to do with the satellite? The man fell to death. It was an accident. And then, Aysel's bathroom. Something black was oozing out of the wall. -It spread to the whole building. -Fuck Aysel's bathroom! Nothing is spreading anywhere. The building is solid, you are weak. Even the smallest things set you off. Something's not right, let's take the satellite dish down. Mehmet, I'm telling you, pull yourself together! There's nothing up there. -Mr. Cihan. -Cut this crap! Straighten yourself up! Go back to your booth. You will not breathe a word about the boiler or this nonsense to anyone in the building. Then you'll buzz them one by one, tell them heating will be out tonight. And don't you ever come to me with this shit again! Go on! I am sorry to bother you. Due to a small outage, radiators will not work tonight. Good evening. "Midnight Bulletin" "Midnight Bulletin" Mom? Your dad wants us to turn off the lights. He's asking for you. Dad? Sit, Yasemin.
