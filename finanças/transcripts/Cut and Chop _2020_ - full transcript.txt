(BRIGHT HARPSICHORD MUSIC) ("WALTZ IN C SHARP MINOR") (KNIFE SCRAPES) What do you want tonight? You know what I want, baby. Pork chops again? Mm. Maybe. Excuse me? Could we get three beef flaps, please? Thanks. Can I help you? Shh. Can I get a pound of ground beef? Sure. Anything else? Not today. You enjoy this? Excuse me, friend? Your work here. Yes, sir, yes. I thought so. ("UNA FURTIVA LAGRIMA") (KNIFE SCRAPES) (KNIFE SCRAPES) (FLESH SQUELCHES) That was too much, Tom. I thought you might like it, you know? What is wrong with you? (SOBS) (MOODY HARP MUSIC) Well, just the two of us. It's cold in here. You know what it is? I'm worried. Well, just the two of us. Cold in here. Please, take your time... Don't ask me to run lines with you. What is that smell? What? That smell, it's rotten. Gross! Go put it in the garbage chute in the hall! What are you doing? Are you stealing all this? Answer me! Yeah. I won't get caught. What? I don't understand, why are you taking these items? It's a surprise. (MUMBLES TO HIMSELF) Two of us. (ESMERELDA SIGHS) Well, just the two of us. Cold in here. Don't forget we have dinner with Gladys and Burt tomorrow. (TOM SOFTLY GRUNTS) (TENSE STRING MUSIC) (BELLS RING) (BLUES MUSIC) - Hot day today. - Oh, yeah. It's gonna get hotter. That'll be two dollars. (REGISTER BLEEPS) (REGISTER DINGS) Hey, can I see that there? - You mean this one? - Oh, yeah, that one. CLERK: Certainly. Oh-ho-ho. How much? Now, cowboy, most people, $70. For you? $60. Thief. (CLERK CHUCKLES) Thief? Come on. Okay, look. $60 to take it. I want it but not today. All right, all right, all right, final offer. $55. Not today. (CAN HISSES) (GULPS) (BELCHES) And that's a no. ("AEOLIAN HARP") Hey, pretty lady. We're still on for dinner with the boys tonight? Of course. I need to see Tom be more social. Did you just get in? Yeah! Me and Burt went to Piano Bar last night. Let's just say momma had one too many. I was thinking for tonight if you two wanna come over early, we could have a little smoke session. Need to cut back on the cocktails so these laugh lines don't get any deeper. Yeah, sounds great. Tom doesn't really get high, though, it makes him act weird, but I'm sure he'll bring his flask. Well, I'm positive him and Burt will get along, then. (ESMERELDA SIGHS) You look under the weather. Gettin' enough rest? Not last night. Tom is driving me crazy. GLADYS: Talk to me, honey. He's at it again. - Ass to mouth? - No! Must have him confused with Gina's beau, Walter. What, then? He's biting me, like, every other time he gets off. Hm. Well? Do you enjoy it? Kind of. But not when he takes chunks out of me. That's the punishment we deserve by dating younger men. Little creeps. (LAUGHS) I'm joking. No, this is serious, he shouldn't bite you. You have to put an end to that shit, honey. But honestly, it sounds kind of steamy. I've never really been bit. No, this is serious. Okay, I wanna show you, come here. (GASPS) Oh, my god! This is serious! - I know. - You have to end it. No! No, he just moved in. I know, but it'll get dirtier, trust me. I was dating a guy a few years ago named Tony, who started choking me every time he got off, but after a month, the poor little man couldn't cum, unless I was on the verge of passing out from suffocation! I told him to back off, right? I think he thought I was using reverse psychology on him, and that I was really wanting a tighter grip on my neck. So I blacked out, woke up a few minutes later, saw Tony at the foot of my bed, eating rocky road ice cream. (TONY LAUGHS) Selfish prick. I told him to get the fuck out and never come back. I'm telling you, it could get nasty. That's what I'm afraid of. Strange. This one's strange. Yeah, I know. I think he's a kleptomaniac, too. Please don't tell anyone, not even Burt. What? That's... Well, I guess I'll keep my belongings close to me tonight. No, no, he doesn't steal things from people that he actually knows. He just takes odd, invaluable objects from random places like gadgets from gas stations, and cheap food from grocery stores, knives from pawn shops. He is a strange little man. What've you gotten yourself into with this one? I don't know. But it's the complex ones that hook us, right? (GLADYS SIGHS) (DOOR CREAKS) Tom? Tom Cain? Come in. Break a limb. (DOOR CREAKS) (HEELS CLACK) Hello, Tom. I'm Ron, the director. To my left is the casting director, Lisa, and to my right is the producer, Roberto. So you will be reading with Lisa today. She'll have you slate your name and height, and you can begin whenever you're ready. There's also a chair to your right, if you'd like to use that for your audition. Okay. Any questions before you begin? Are you afraid? You should be. My name's Tom Cain and I'm five-foot-nine.

Come in. (DOOR CREAKS) Well, it's good to see you again, Tom. We've been waiting for you. Take a seat, if you like. I'll stand. Well, we decided to call you in today, not for a callback, but to offer you the role. We're holding callbacks for some other roles this afternoon, but decided to go ahead and offer you the role in person, considering that you don't have representation. Your audition last week blew us away. We showed your audition tape to the rest of the team and without a doubt, we all agree, you are the one for the role. Well, what do ya say, Tom? Have we found our antagonist in Cut and Chop? (KNOCKS) Hey! - Good to see you again! - You too. BURT: You must be Tom. We give hugs. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey, pretty lady! - Hi! - Thanks for coming. - Of course. - Hi, Tom. - Hello. Nice to see you again. Burt, I can't believe you and Tom have never met. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, well, I know. It seems like it probably should've happened already. You and Gladys have been working together for what, half a year now? Almost eight months? We've been trying to get the four of us together ever since. And that's the way the cookie crumbles. Yeah, well, crumbling cookies and all, it's time we all made up for some lost time. So, make yourselves at home, have a seat. Tom, can I get you a drink? TOM: Sure. Now, I had some beer, but I drank it all last night. But, I can offer you some fine whiskey. Oh, I brought some, too. Oh, yeah? My kinda man. How about you take a shot out of mine, and then I take a shot out of whatever you pour me? You know what? I like the way you think. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. I got myself this vintage whiskey here when I sold my first screenplay recently. - Oh, you're a writer? - Yeah. (CHUCKLES) I sold a script for some laughable amount to this little indie production company, but I was real happy with the process, so I treated myself to that whiskey. Congrats, are they gonna keep you on for rewrites? Oh, no, they got these young Hollywood hustlers saying they're gonna come in, tear it apart, put it back together again. Basically, Tom, they just bought my idea, and they want me out of it. (CHUCKLES) But hell, I don't care. I mean, I'm happy, it's the first thing I ever sold. Hey. - Cheers. - Cheers. (GLASSES CLINK) (BURT COUGHS) - Oh, my god. (COUGHS) - Mm, mm-mm-mm. - Damn! - That's tasty. Oh, my god. What the hell was that? Oh, that's an out-of-work actor's pour. (CHUCKLES) Well, it looks like Burt and Tom are gettin' along. Yeah, that's odd. Tom does not warm up to people quickly. (CHUCKLES) Well, Burt has a way about him. And it looks like they're both warming up quickly with that whiskey. As long as Tom doesn't get carried away and take a bite out of my little Burt. I'm just happy to see him smiling. Hey, ladies? Care for a little drink? I told you, baby, I'm gonna lay off the sauce tonight. You want one? Yeah, maybe I'll have something simple like a vodka tonic? Make vodka tonic for our guest, dear. Comin' up! All right. Oh, you could make another one of those, I'll drink it before we head out. Sure thing, pal. (ICE CUBES CLINK) Splash of vodka. Now for the best part. No, no, no, I'm okay. Oh, all right. - Shall we? - Yeah. - Okay. - Oh, that tastes good. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Here you go, baby. - Oh, okay, yeah. Thank you, sweetie. Well, yeah, we were just gonna go out and hit the grocery and get a little six pack, but uh, Tom, you wanna smoke? Why not? You're gonna smoke, baby? Don't worry. Hey, are you sure? It didn't hit you in a good place last time. I wasn't happy then, I'm happy now. Happy for my new friend. (BURT CHUCKLES) Nice, pal. (TOM EXHALES) Let's get nasty. (RAIN SPLASHES) So, you're an actor, huh? You working on any projects at the moment? Perhaps I am right now. TOM: Yeah, I booked a role for an indie film today. Really? We'll have to go celebrate, congratulations. Yeah, what kind of role was it? Oh, I'd rather not go into it. (BURT CHUCKLES) Now, that's a first. I think you're the only actor I've ever met that didn't wanna talk about himself, or the role he was playing. (TOM CHUCKLES) Well, I haven't told Esmerelda yet. Oh. Okay. Probably for a good reason. I can respect that. Yeah. Well, shall we? ("THE BLUE DANUBE") Repetition, repetition, repetition. Huh, I knew it. Meisner. What? Yeah, you studied the Meisner technique. Serious method acting. Meisner. Yeah. Hold on. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah, hey, sweetie. Well, yeah. Yeah, we're at the grocery. Mm-hm. Oh, yeah. Yeah, let me ask. Tom? The girls are ordering Pho, you want any... Beef, tendon and tripe. Yeah, beef, tendon and tripe. Got it. (CHUCKLES) Okay, see you soon, sweetie. Okay, bye. All right. Hola, amigo. No more chopping today. You like to watch more than buy, huh? (TENSE STRING MUSIC) BUTCHER: You look like you want my job. (DISTORTED VOICE) - You do want my job! Hey, you've got the wrong guy. Amigo, I see you every day. (CHUCKLES) (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) ("NOCTURNE IN B FLAT MINOR") God bless this food, God bless our bodies. In Christ's name, we pray. Amen. Yeah. (ESMERELDA CHUCKLES) BURT: This all looks so tantalizing. (TOM SIGHS) Do you have any hot sauce? - Hot sauce? - Yeah. Yeah. - There you go. - Oh, my favorite. Yeah, you can't put enough of that stuff on there. I tell you what. (CHUCKLES) Mm! Oh, this is good. Yeah. Tom, get after those wings. (FOOD CRUNCHES AND SQUELCHES) So you guys are leaving tomorrow, right? Yeah. We'll be on Balboa Island for the rest of the weekend. My aunt has a place there. She coaxed us to stay while she's gonna be in Berlin. Oh, that sounds fun. Right? You should come out there at some point. My Uncle Bob could take us out on the yacht. ESMERELDA: Oh! BURT: I'm fearful of Bob. He has a yacht and a better mustache than me. (GROUP CHUCKLES) Seriously, sweetie, didn't you say he used to own one of the largest real estate investment companies in all Los Angeles? Mm-hm, at one point. I think he sold it to Warren Buffet in the early '90s. And now he spends his entire retirement trying to lure young bikini-clad women onto his yacht. I mean, it's a dirty job but someone has to do it. Oh, one day, sugar loaf. One day that'll be papa. (LAUGHS) (TOM MOANS) ESMERELDA: So Burt, Gladys tells me that you're a writer. Mm, yeah. ESMERELDA: What kind of stuff are you writin'? Oh, screenplays mainly, yeah. I was telling Tom about one earlier. A little horror film I've been working on. Has more of an ominous feel to it. And I've got another one that I've been working on. It's more loosely based on my adolescence. So that one's (CHUCKLES) more of a pornographic nature. (LAUGHS) (TOM MOANS) (LAUGHS) (COUGHS) Hey, you got some more of that whiskey back there? - Oh, boy. - Tom. Hey, Tom. I think you've had enough to drink tonight. It's okay. I've got the actor's pour. Look, look here, buddy. Why don't you just grab the couch over there? I know how this Pho can get to a man. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, come on. I don't know. Had a little too much, that's all. He's gonna be okay, right, yeah? Yeah, sure. I'm sorry, guys. Oh, no, it's okay. That's what a couch is for, get a little rest. (LAUGHS) Hey, put a little more hot sauce on that. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. (CHUCKLES) GLADYS: Yeah, party down. (WOMEN LAUGH) Send that over here to momma. (CHUCKLES) - Daddy want? - Daddy wants. - Spice it up, daddy. - Daddy always wants. (GROUP CHUCKLES) GLADYS: Yeah, it's so true. (WOMEN CHUCKLE) (JAUNTY ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HEELS CLACK) (HEELS CLACK) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Tom is missing. GLADYS: Really? Oh, well, he must've slid past us without us realizing it. Probably went home to crash. Well, you only live a few blocks away, right? Right, right, I'll give him a call. (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGS) Oh, boy. (PHONE RINGS) Well, I guess I'll go home. No worries. I'm sure he's there, tucked away in a coma. Has he ever done this before? Yeah. Last time he got stoned, it was so creepy. We were visiting my sister in Vermont and he got high with my brother-in-law, started talkin' to himself and then wandered into the woods alone. Got back to the house close to dawn and crawled into bed with me. (THUNDER CLAPS) Crying softly. He slept for 12 hours. That's why I didn't want him to smoke tonight. (BURT CHUCKLES) Well, I can see why you don't want the old boy hittin' the pipe hard like that, but hey, take comfort in the fact that at some point during the night, he'll just come slitherin' right back to ya. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What a strange evening. Mm. (MOANS) What, what's that? What a strange evening. Yeah. Yeah, Tom is strange. You know, aside from the drool, I kinda like him. Do you? Yeah. I do. He's creative, you know? I think he may be an excellent actor. Should I call and check on Esmerelda, see if Tom's there? Oh, well, yeah. You can call on our way out in the morning. I'm sure they're fine. She's fine.

(PHONE RINGS) Hello? Hi, is this Tom Cain speaking? - Yeah. - Oh, hi, Tom. Ron Womack here, director for the film Cut and Chop. Oh, hey there. I know it's a bit unorthodox for me to be callin' you, but I just wanted to, one of my producers got your voicemail this morning regarding conflict for shoot day, so I just wanted to call and clear things up directly. What're we looking at here, Tom? Well, I'm gonna have to skedaddle on out of the country here next week and I can't have too many questions asked, but someone has died. Oh, I see, is everything okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Okay, let me see here. All right, you know, you're not making things easy on my end, Tom, but let me see what I can do. When exactly are you leaving? Well, I'll be gone this time next week, so next Saturday. Okay, I'm gonna arrange to shoot your stuff early this week. As you know, this is a low-budget film, so you're kinda putting me in a bind here with locations and whatnot, but I'm friends with the owner, so I should be able to get you in the shoot this week. TOM: Oh, great! Yeah, now this isn't how we normally do things in the business, but you're perfect. I mean, spot-on for the role. Thank you. RON: I hope that a few days gives you enough time to prepare. TOM: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. Splendid, so you're good with everything else, otherwise? TOM: Mm-hm, everything is rare and fine. All right. (BUSY TONE DRONES) Hm? Hm. (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) Oh, yeah. Oh! I wish you'd do some more of those downward dogs, so daddy can watch. I think I gave you enough downward dog action last night. Daddy want some more? Daddy always wants more. (BOTH CHUCKLE) - Daddy will get. - Oh, yeah. Woof! (GLADYS SCOFFS) I'm kinda worried. Oh, yeah? About what, pumpernickel? Esmerelda hasn't responded to any of my texts since yesterday, it's not like her. Well, I'm sure old Tom boy has her deep and planted in downward dog about right now. (CHUCKLES) That's all you think about, downward dogs. Oh, no. That or the old piledriver. (GLADYS CHUCKLES) But that one can get old. Sometimes you really show your age. Those whiskers don't fool me. Oh, yeah? (GLADYS LAUGHS) Okay. - That was funny, momma. - Yes, it was funny. - Yeah, papa's gonna show you. - What's papa gonna show me? It's right over here, and you're gonna really enjoy.

Is this Esmerelda's? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want you to know that me and Esmerelda got into a quarrel yesterday and she left this morning to go to her mom's for a few days to blow off some steam. She left her phone with you? TOM: Well, yeah, she wanted to clear the head fully. I don't understand, it seems kind of abrupt, and not to infringe on your privacy, Tom, but she would usually tell me. Especially if she was going out of town. Well, it was her decision and I think that maybe me and LA were causing her some anxiety. Kind of at a loss for words. And I don't wanna put you and Burt on the spot but I was wondering if you two would come over for dinner tomorrow night. It's just that I'm feeling down since the argument and well, you two are the closest thing that I have to friends. Yeah, let me talk to Burt. (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) I'm sure we can make it over for dinner tomorrow night after work, 7:30? Voila. So, I'm assuming Esmerelda won't make it into the showroom tomorrow? TOM: Right. So, shall I tell them anything at work, then? No, no, no, I'm sure she'll handle it from her mom's. Okay. TOM: And don't worry, Esmerelda's in great hands. And by the way, don't bother bringing anything over for dinner tomorrow night, I'll be cooking. (KNIFE THUDS) (BUSY TONE DRONES) (SEAGULLS SQUAWK) Everything all right, sweetheart? I don't know.

(SMOOTH JAZZ MUSIC) (BELLS RING) (CLERK CHUCKLES) You got the itch. Oh, yeah, you know it. You own this place, right? Since 1987. Well I've got somethin' for you.

It's good! Toothsome. - What is it, Filet Mignon? - It is. Oh, I get it. So you want my whiskey for your Filet Mignon? That's right. Well... Top shelf? Take all of it. All? No, no, no. I was thinking maybe six steaks for that one there. (CLERK LAUGHS) - Six? - No, no, no, I'm serious. I can't give you more than eight. I've got people coming over for dinner tonight, and I have to save some of the fine cuts there. Well, then okay, then we'll do that, but then I'll give you some whiskey from right over there. - It'd be perfect. - No, no, no! God damn it, I'm taking the bottom shelf. If you want eight, I'm taking the best bourbon you got. Okay, fine! Okay, okay, okay. Let me taste it, I wanna taste it. Now, to be honest with you, I wouldn't marinade or over-spice that. The natural flavor is unparalleled. (CHUCKLES) It almost makes me miss her. Well... Until next time you get the itch. Yeah, next time. (BELLS RING) (JAUNTY HARMONICA MUSIC) Why do you have that? Oh, I was gonna let Tom read it. Shouldn't he just wait and see the actual movie? No, what I have here is completely different that what's gonna be made. (CHUCKLES) I haven't even been invited to set. (FOOTSTEPS CLACK) Hey, man. How's it goin'? Hi, can I help you? Oh, yeah, just here with my girlfriend. She's pickin' out some wine. Wow, you guys have some great selections here. Hey, your friend, the one you come here with. What's his name? Oh, uh, Tom. Tom? BURT: Yeah. Oh, right. Hey, look. (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry about the other night, he had a little bit too much of the Cerveza. (CHUCKLES) When you see him next? Well, actually, we're going over to his apartment tonight to have a little dinner. You tell him, come here quick. I can't (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE), I lose my job! - Because of Tom? - Si, senor. Well, why? Stay away. (TENSE STRING MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKS) (ELEVATOR DINGS) (DOOR THUDS) (ELEVATOR DINGS) Hello! Finishing touches. Follow me. ("FANTAISIE-IMPROMPTU") (DOOR SQUEAKS) (DOOR SQUEAKS) Huh. Well, Tom. You've really outdone yourself. Don't mention it. Sit, sit, please. ("NOCTURNE NO. 20") All right. Now, Burt, I've got somethin' that I know you and me will enjoy, but Gladys, I highly suggest that you partake as well. I recommend we start with this, and then move on to the red wine which you all brought, which will pair oh so well with the delicacy that I've prepared for us. Well, Tom, I mean, this is really amazing. I mean, I have to ask you, though, I mean, why so fancy? We were thinking more along the lines of chicken and beer. (GLADYS AND BURT CHUCKLE) Well, you two showed us such a nice time the other evening that I feel compelled. Plus, I feel rotten about haven gotten so leathered up the other evening and making a fool of myself that I wanted to make it up to you and Esemerelda, you know? Well, this is all very impressive. BURT: Yeah, very impressive. Just you wait. Good. Let's cheers. To new friends. Cheers. (GLASSES CLINK) Cheers. Hm. Tom, this is place looks immaculate. Do you guys hire a cleaning service? (LAUGHS) I clean. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, Esmerelda doesn't strike me as the type of gal that would keep a place in perfect order like this. I can really see what she sees in you, Tom. This is very sweet of you and quite unexpected. Speaking of Esmerelda, have you spoken to her yet? Quite a lot, actually, but she won't talk back. It's very odd. Peter, the owner of our store, got a text from her this morning when he got into work saying she couldn't come in 'cause of a death in the family? He tried calling her back but she wouldn't answer. He was pretty upset how she called out of work via text, instead of calling him, and he asked me if I knew anything. You know, knowing we were friends. What did you say? After talking to you yesterday, what could I say? I had to lie and say I didn't know anything. I mean, if she chooses to lie, I'm sure it's for a good reason. - Do you still have her phone? - Yeah, of course, yeah. It's so odd that she didn't take her phone with her to her mom's. Oh, no, no, she must've texted Peter from her mom's phone. Thought about that? I didn't think of that. Is that who you've been calling, her mom, to talk to her, since she doesn't have her phone? Yeah. Yeah, but (CHUCKLES) nevermind that, let's drink up. We have a fine bourbon before us here. Oh yeah, well (CHUCKLES) I'm not opposed to that, brother. (GLASSES CLINK) Well, that about does her. I hope you guys are hungry. Oh, hey! Absolutely, man. Hey, what do you have in there, huh? It smells extraordinary. (TOM LAUGHS) And extraordinary it is. Yeah, this is gonna take a hot minute to cool, so I prepared us an appetizer. ("SYMPHONY NO. 9, MOVEMENT 2") Hope you guys like tartare. (BURT LAUGHS) Wow! Hot damn! I love me some tartare. (FOOD SQUELCHES) Ah. Now, that looks good right there. That is one fine-lookin' tartare. Yeah. Oh, boy. Now look at that right there. Wow. It's good. There you go. Some crackers. Oh, yeah. Mm! Mm. Mm. Mm, mm, mm. So what do you think? Well, it's pretty good, but it has kind of a, um, kind of a strange taste to it. Kind of a funk, you know? But hell, I like funk. (CHUCKLES) TOM: Me, too. Gladys? You gonna try? I'm not a big fan of tartare. BURT: Sweetie, now come on. It takes a lot of effort to make tartare, just try some. Mm-hm. Oh, I almost forgot. You two wanna get high? No, not me, you two. Oh, well yeah, sure. Yes, I would love to smoke, having just come off work. - Do you have any bud? - Oh, yeah, Esmerelda's. She won't mind at all. - Really, are you sure? - Yeah. Of course not. (DOORS CREAK) What the fuck? Oh, I know, right? I mean, who would've thought Tom was the housewife of the century? That's not what I'm talking about. Something's off. Oh, I don't know. I mean, I just think he's a kookie actor. He seems too excited for us to be here. I expected to lick wounds with him over his fight with Esmerelda. Yeah, well, I mean, I think he's just a little socially awkward. He's just trying to put on a good show for us. Yeah, maybe you're right. Well, look, either way, he's an original, and true eccentricity is few and far between. I just wanna know Esmerelda's all right. Found it. ("NOCTURNE NO. 20") A final toast before we begin. To Esmerelda. - To Esmerelda. - To Esmerelda. (GLASSES CLINK) Look great. (OMINOUS TONES) I'm glad you guys aren't vegetarians. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, right. I typically shy away from red meat, but since you've gone through so much trouble, and now that I'm baked, I'd probably eat anything. Yeah, Tom. What kind of meat is this? Veal. - Veal, huh? - Mm-hm. Well... I gotta say, it's quite sumptuous. Haven't had veal in a long time. I've never had veal before. It's pretty good. Sweet. Yeah. Sweet. It is very sweet. Sweeter than I recall veal tasting, Tom. Where'd you get this veal? Was it the meat market around the corner? Yeah. Well, we stopped by there earlier on the way over. That, uh, butcher there, he... He seemed rather unhinged. What do you think? I think he cuts a hell of a steak. (BURT CHUCKLES) Yeah. ("SYMPHONY NO. 9, MOVEMENT 2") Mm. Tom? I gotta say. That was absolutely delicious. Thank you. Burt, uh, will you come in the back room with me? I wanna show you something. It's somethin' I've been working on and, uh, I think you'll appreciate it as an artist. Oh, sure. You know, I wanna show you somethin' as well, Tom. TOM: Really? Yeah. Gladys, uh, smoke as much of that as you want. Thanks. I'm not trying to be rude, but we're probably gonna take off pretty soon, though. I've got an early day of work tomorrow. Okay. Shall we? Yeah, sure. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Wow. Spacious, Tom. ("MOONLIGHT SONATA") This painting here, Tom. Was that yours or Esmerelda's choice? What do you think? I don't know. Feel free to smoke a cigarette in here. Well, you sure? Yeah, you never know when it might be your last. (BURT CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Yeah, well, cool. Don't mind if I do. What you got there, Tom? Well, this is part of what I wanted to show you. Come on down and take a look. Well, okay, sure. (CHOKES) (CHOKES) (TOM GRUNTS) (DOORS CREAK) - Where's Burt? - Helping me with my work. - Work? - Creative. Could you tell Burt we need to be goin' soon? TOM: Soon. (GLADYS CHOKES) (FLESH TEARS) (BODY CLUNKS) (BLOOD DRIPS) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (WOMAN WHINES) Cut! Okay, I really need to talk to you about him. I cannot work with this guy anymore. Everything's going fine, it's perfect. It's not okay, what he's doing afterwards. No, it's perfect, he's giving you so much to work off of. Look, I don't feel safe, you have to understand that. He's acting. Everything is going fine, nothing's going to happen to you. He's doing the same thing, even after you call cut. I'm telling you, I do not feel safe. I really need you to talk to him.
