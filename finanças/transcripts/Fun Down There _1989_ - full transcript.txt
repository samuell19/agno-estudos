[DOOR KNOCK] MRS. FIELDS (OFFSCREEN): Buddy, are you awake? What are you doing in there? -Shit! MRS. FIELDS (OFFSCREEN): I'm coming in! -No, I'm sleeping! MRS. FIELDS (OFFSCREEN): You are not. -Don't come in! Shit! -Rumor has it that Buddy might be moving out. -What? -I heard it at the Elbow Room last night. Joey said he's thinking about moving out. -Did he say anything about where he's going? -No. No where, no when. It's been just rumor has it. -Do you think it's something we've done? -I don't know. -No? -I don't know any of the details. Ah! -He's been acting funny lately. -Oh, that's something else to worry about. -There's something. -Good morning! -Good morning, Buddy. -Hi, Mom. -Don't eat them all! Hey. -So what's all the talk about moving out? -Jesus! -I don't want to talk about it. -He's awful damn moody lately. [DOOR SLAMMING] -Maybe it's because he's breaking up with Laura. -Laura? It's Laura's brother he's after! -Judy, please! -Well! [LAUGH] -I just worry about him paying for the rent after quitting his job. Well, I'm going into town and get that muffler changed. -I'm going back to bed. -If you'll just wait a minute for me to change, I'll go in with you. There's some things I want to get at the Grand Union. -OK. -Give me a drag. -One. -Woo-hoo! Hey, Jeannie and I were at the Elbow Room last night and Laura was there. -Yeah? -She was with Jack. -Jesus, you make such a big deal out of it, Laura and me. How long is this going to take, anyway? -If I don't get it cold enough, it's going to hurt when the needle goes through! [DOOR__SHUTTING] MRS. FIELDS (OFFSCREEN): Judy, are you smoking again? -No, mom. Tom was here. -What the hell are you doing? -I'm piercing his ear. -Jesus Christ, what is that? Some kind of New York City style? Hey, remember when we drove down there to see the Yankees? You must've been about 12 then. -I was 13. -Is that numb enough? -Yeah, it's fine. -We had a really good time, huh? -Yeah. -Sit still. -Hey kids, I got a cake mix and some frosting. I think I'll put a cake together this afternoon. Got a good deal on cookies, too, three for $1.00. Usually they're two! -Sit down. There, it's through. Just sit-- don't touch it! There, it's bleeding just a little. Hold it right there. Don't touch it! Just leave it in. Let's get some tunes. It look all right? -It's fine. -Does it hurt? Ah! -So where are you moving to? -You know Laura's brother John? He's got a house over in Ithaca he's renting with a couple guys. Says they might have an extra room. -But Buddy, how are you gonna pay the rent? I don't know why you quit that job on the farm. They liked you so much. -I got money saved up, you know. Besides, it's cheap. -Hey, that's not gonna last forever. -I can get a job in Ithaca, you know. -Uh oh, Pete. We forgot the you know what! -Oh Jesus, the toilet paper? -Hey, they're having a sale on butane over at Kmart. -Oh really? -Ha, Dad! -Hey, you know, we always told you that you're welcome to stay here until you meet a girl and get married. -I know, Dad. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] -Boo! What the hell are you doing? -"Playgirl"? I thought it was supposed to be "Playboy," Buddy! -Give me that! -No! -Get out of here! -Oh, he's real cute, isn't he? -Get out of here! Leave that here! JUDY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, sure. But I don't know what you're doing with it! [CRICKETS CHIRPING] -Hi, do you have a cigarette? -No, I don't usually smoke. -Want one? -Yeah, sure. Thanks. -This came from the Palladium. -Hey, little faggots! Hey, fucking faggots! Fuck you! -Hey man, do you want to go for a walk? -Uh, sure. OK. [? Yeah. ?] Yeah. [COUGH] -Coming! -Yes! -Hi. Oh, I woke you. -Joseph! -Hi. -My god, baby, what's wrong? It's nearly 4 o'clock in the morning. -Nothing. Uh, can, can we just use your place for awhile? [SIGH] -Well, sweetheart, I can't. I'm sorry. It's just too late, OK? -Well, uh, what about the roof? Is the door open? -I don't know. Oh, sweetheart, I have to go. Mwah! Here's a kiss for you. Have a good little wank. -Hm. [COUGH] -You OK? [CRYING] JOSEPH (OFFSCREEN): You OK? What's wrong? [COUGH] -Shh! -Huh? -Go back to sleep, Gary. Shh! It's only Joseph on the roof, OK? Shh! -What time is it? OK, thanks. Heh! [SIGH] -Waiter! -I gave your number to a friend of mine, by the way. She really needs more headshots and she really likes the ones you did of me. -Yeah? -So maybe you'll get some work out of it. -Great. [SIGH] -It's pretty fun eating breakfast outside, isn't it? -Yeah. I used to come here a lot. That is, until I moved to Brooklyn. -Yeah? -So tell me, what was it like working on a farm? -Aw, it was really easy. Pay was pretty good too. I got $5.00 an hour. -Well, what kind of work did you do? -Um, shoveled out the stalls and hosed them down, mostly. -Sounds wonderful. -Sometimes in the summer I took the cows out to pasture, work on the fences. Sometimes I'd, uh, help with the milking. -I can't imagine sitting on this little stool, yanking on udders. -Nobody does it by hand anymore unless you got one cow! We use machines. Hey, which way's the john? -Uh, back through those doors. Uh, make a left. [POLICE SIRENS] [SIGH] [COUGH] -Oh, Paul? The check, please. I'm doing a play next month. No pay, unfortunately. -"Macbeth." Uh, what part are you playing? -Uh, Fleance a, and a frog. -There's a frog in "Macbeth"? -Well, no, not originally, but this is a sort of children's version. -A children's version of "Macbeth"? -Well, it's a part, isn't it? -Come on, let's get out of here. Uh, we'll get you in your hotel, you can get some sleep. -OK. -Maybe you want to go to that party with me later. [CONSTRUCTION SOUNDS] [SINGING IN FRENCH] "Oh, when at last our life on Earth is through, I shall share eternity with you. If you love me, really love me, then whatever happens, I won't care." [SINGING IN FRENCH] [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] -Greta, what are you looking for? -Kent, I'm just looking for my earring. I was in the kitchen. It looks like this. And I was talking to Gary and I noticed I didn't have it on. OK? -Listen. GRETA (OFFSCREEN): OK. -Let me finish what I was telling you about. [SIGH] -You know seven people, right? [LAUGH] -After you've signed up seven people, you become first mate. -Uh-huh. -When they've signed up seven, you become captain of the submarine and you start to get checks in the mail. -Sure, sure, sure. And that means that all these seven people have to put in $1,000, right? -Look, I know someone who's gotten $12,000 already who's got a very positive energy. He's manifesting money. -Manifesting money. Kent, I think this is just another one of your get rich quick schemes, darling. Now how the hell do you think that I am going to get $1,000? -Look, if you're going to be negative about it-- -No! ---it's not going to work for you. You could borrow the money, couldn't you? Maybe from your father. Kayla! -He was on the beach with his parents, and I watched him for maybe an hour. He was exquisitely crafted. About 16. Those, those heavy, adolescent hands that are too big for the, for the arms-- -Mm. ---weighing him down. A chest just beginning to articulate itself. Cuts just coming to the surface. Ah, the hollow under the arm, ending in ripples over the ribs. God, he was magnificent. Just magnificent. -What about his chest? Was it smooth? -He was creamy from head to foot and-- -Ooh! ---utterly un-self-conscious. -Did you ever see him again? [KNOCKING] -Only that once. [SINGING] -Wooh! MALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Excuse me, Greta! Who's this? -Hi , Greta! -Joseph! MALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Joseph. FEMALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Mm, Joseph. -Ah! Sweetheart. Oh, great! MALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Do you know Joseph? FEMALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): No. -Come in. MALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Ah. I'll introduce you. FEMALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Joseph. MALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Ha. [LAUGH] MALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Now this is unusual. FEMALE PARTYGOER (OFFSCREEN): Really? -Quite different. What do you think? -Too young. -Ah! He's old enough. But, uh, has a bigger nose and brown eyes, I think. -Um, Joseph, darling? Um, Buddy? I want you to introduce you to Sandy-- -Hi. ---and to Kayla, and to Catherine. -Hi. -There you go. -Hi. -Oh, and to Simon and to Paul. [LAUGH] -Where's Gary? -Oh, fuck, shoot. You know, he's getting dressed. I'll just-- oh darling, I'll just go and hurry him up. Mwah! OK. [LAUGH] -Guys, I have to go tell her her hair looks great, OK? Excuse me. -Oh yeah. -Joseph, watch out for Kent. [LAUGH] -So what do you do? -I'm a dancer. -Oh, like ballet dancing? -No, modern jazz. Broadway, stuff like that. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. -Have I seen, have I seen you on TV? I thought before you look really familiar. -No, uh-uh. -Were you on "Solid Gold" or on any videos or anything? -No, no. -No? -But, uh, did you see last month in, uh, Trenton, New Jersey? The dinner theater? "South Pacific"? You know, "Wash that man right out of my hair"? -No, I hadn't seen it. -You've gotta understand, I'm a little bit nervous, right? This is my first Voodoo ceremony. And everybody's going along fine. The music is lulling- -Oh fuck! Look at my hair! ---everybody to sleep. -Right. -And wham! The guy falls on the floor. Kind of gets up, writhing like this. -Yeah, right. -Sticks a machete in the floor, and-- -Joseph, really? Do you really like my hair? -Yeah, it's great. -It's awful. All the people out there, they're laughing at me. -Sticks his machete in the floor, pours rum on it-- -Gary, Gary, look at my hair. -It's OK. Your hair's fine. -I hate it! It's awful! Look at it! Oh! -It's fine. -It's not. No. -Here, would you take this? -Mm, I hate it. It's so awful. -It's OK. Relax. Relax, sweetheart. [LAUGH] -You must make a lot of money dancing, then, huh? -Um, well, actually, I work as a waitress too. -Yeah? -Yeah. -As a waitress? -Yeah. Greta owns a restaurant on St. Mark's Place. -She does? -Yeah. A lot of the people here work there. -You know, I might need some money. Could she give me a job there? -Hm, she might, actually. I think we need a dishwasher. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Oh, that'd be great. That's really easy. -Yeah. But, uh, I don't think you should ask her tonight. [LAUGHTER] -Why don't you come in tomorrow and fill out an application? -Oh, that's a good idea. -Yeah. -Want some? -No thanks. -Um, you'll be there? -Yeah, I will. -Great. -Yeah. -Maybe I'll come by. -OK, good. -Takes his machete, sticks it in the floor, pours rum on it. -Oh bravo. -Lights it on fire-- -Oh god, there was. -And starts dancing. -You want an answer or an argument? -An answer! -No! -Why not? -Now you want an argument! -Uh-huh. [LAUGHTER] -It's like she was studying you or something, like you was a book or a play! The way you walk, talk, what you eat, what you wear. -Oh, I don't see! I think it's a compliment. I don't see anything wrong with it! [LAUGH] -I'm sure that's very flattering, Betty. [LAUGHTER] -I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this. -I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this! Oh, I love you! I love you! You know, I think you are the fuckingest funniest man in the entire world. -Oh, oui, oui! -Oui, oui! Would you do me a little favor? Would you do Ruth Gordon as Blanche DuBois? [SIGH] -Do it for, do it for Joseph! -Do Ruth, please? -He hasn't seen it! -Let me get in my Ruth DuBois stance, here. [LAUGHTER] -So-- hey! Hey, Stella! Stella! Listen, they tell me to take a streetcar named Desire, get off on summertime! [LAUGHTER] -Boy, was it crowded! Well, how am I anyway? [LAUGHTER] -Stella! Stella! Here, you look like shit! Oh, boy. I still got my figure! Oh, oh, fuck, Stella, what you've done with this place! Oh my god! [LAUGHTER] -Do, do, do, do, do, do something, do some Hayward. Um, uh, "Valley." Do "Valley." -"Valley of the Dolls?" -Um, uh, Helen Lewis. -How you get on. -I love her. -Do you like me? I must say. [LAUGHTER] -Oh, whatever. -Give me a drink. -They drummed you out of Hollywood. [LAUGH] -So ya come crawling back to Broadway. Well, Broadway doesn't go for booze and dope. Now get out of my way! I got a man waiting for me. I'll go out VIP. -That's wonderful! That is wonderful! Oh, oh! How I love him! -Oh, Simon, have you met, have you met Buddy? -Wooh, wooh! -Yeah, yeah we-- -I haven't had the pleasure. How do you do? -I haven't either. Hello, Buddy. -Oh, Buddy! How do you do, Mr. Fabian? Why do they always look like nappy rabbits? -(SCREAMING) Because they are! -Whoa! [LAUGH] -Oh god! -Gary, can we mooch some coke? Oh god, isn't he amazing? Isn't he the funniest man, funniest man in the whole world? Here, quick. Snort it. Ah! Ruth Gordon as Blanche DuBois, isn't he amazing? Take it. Sniff it. That's it, sweetheart. Up the nose. Oh! Oh! -Who is Blanche DuBois? -What? -So anyway, he takes the sword out of his stomach. No, seriously! And-- I'm telling them about a trip to Haiti. FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Well, I think it was a lovely party. MALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Well, I'm sorry I missed it in that case. FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, you should have been there. FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Yes. MALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. -Hi! -Hi, Cathy. How are you? -Good, how are you? -I'm OK. -You're filling out an application? -Yeah, yeah. -Good. Did you talk to Greta? -Well, she gave me this, but she's going to come back and talk to me after I finish it. -Oh, good. She, she's a little weird, but she's really OK. -Yeah. -I think she'll hire you. -The, uh-- oh, Greta. Um, your father called. -Uh-huh. -That's right, your father called. -Oh. -Twice. -Twice. -Angelo, thank you, thank you. -You're welcome. -I know. I just talked to him. -He said it was important. -Uh, you want to know what he said? -He said he was spending the last two and a half hours waiting for me-- -Really? ---at the Plaza Hotel and where the hell was I. Thank you. -You're welcome. [SIGH] -I was at the Plaza Hotel, the stupid old bastard. I waited for him for two and a half hours. [LAUGH] -Good. -Did you meet him? -Mm-hmm. I was in New York and he was in London. I mean, it's no wonder that we never see one another. Hmph! -Sorry, love. -Can't get dates straight, let alone the country. -He was in the Plaza in London? -Yes. He's an alkie, darling. [LAUGHTER] -Like father, like daughter, I think. -So, uh, Greta? -Mm? -You remember Buddy from last night at the party? -Yeah, you should, you should have him take that job as a dishwasher. -Bobby? -Buddy. -He's kind of cute. -Bobby? -He's kind of cute, and I think he can hold down the job, too. -Oh, yeah, yeah. -We need a new dishwasher. -We don't. -Yeah. -Yes, we do. -We do need a dishwasher! -I don't think they're hiring anybody. -He's cute. -I'm sure he's fine. -It's the perfect opportunity. -It's only washing dishes. He'd be great, really. -Hire him. Come on, hire him! -Guys, calm down. OK? I'll think about it. [LAUGH] -Um, uh, uh, Billy? -Buddy! Buddy. -Oh, sorry. Excuse me. How do you do? -Is this for me? -Uh, yes, darling. -Thank you. -Uh, excuse me. OK. [SIGH] -Can I, uh, see that? -Yup. -Thank you. Uh, Buddy Fields. -Mm-hmm. -Can-- [YAWN] -Oh god, excuse me. It says here, nine months at Pizza Hut at the Pine City Mall. -Mm-hmm. -Oh, that's just fascinating! Three years at Richmond Dairy Farm. [LAUGH] -Yeah. -I'm sorry. Oh, I can't eat dairy. I can't touch it. -Why not? -Really, it's truly, it's terrible for you. It's mucus-forming. Uh, it's bad for your health. Do you know that yesterday, I actually, I ate some dairy. Blew me up like a pig. Truly, it's awful. -You look fine. [LAUGH] -Thank you. Um-- -Yeah? -I'll, uh, start you off as a dishwasher. -OK, sure. [SIGH] -Thank god that's over. Mm, tonight! -Oh, OK! -Tonight, all right? -Yeah, yeah. -Then we'll see. Ha! I don't know. Thank god. Excuse me, I look like death warmed up. [COUGH] [COUGH] -Sandy? -Hm? -Oh Sandy! -Yes? -Show us your tits! -What? -Show us the tits. -Boy oh boy, it's slowed down out there. -Come on. Come on! -What's going on? -Sandy's going to show us the tits. Oh, come on! -Oh yeah, sure. -Oh, no. Please, I'm sure! -Oh Sandy, you can do it! Sandy, I've never seen you like this. -Get out of here. -Come on, you've always wanted to do that. -Admit it! [LAUGH] -No! -Come on, Sandy! Go for it! -Sandy! Sandy! -Stop it! -Sandy! Sandy! -Sandy! Sandy, please! -All right! Here, here, here! Happy? [LAUGHTER] -What a disappointment! -It looks just like Barbie! [LAUGHTER] -Miss me, Barbie doll? -Oh, jeez! Jeez! -She's kind of old, from 1960. She's in real good shape too, don't you think? -Could I have a guacamole and chips appetizer, please? -Well, Catherine! -Yes? -Yes, I think I can do that for you. -Why, thank you! -But Catherine? -Yes, Simon? -Show us your tits! -Just hurry up with my order! -Veda, get out! Get out before I kill you! Ha ha! You're going to have to move faster than that! -Hey! -It's his first day! -Well! I guess you told me! -Listen, you should wear an apron. You won't get so wet. -Yeah, I probably should. -Take this one. -No. -Yeah, turn around! -Ah! [GROWL] -Ooh! That's sweet! -Oh! -That looks so nice. -How's that? -That's great, thanks. -Oh! -Uh, look pretty good to me too. -Grow up a lot. [LAUGH] -Oh my! -If she could go back to Brooklyn. -I had no idea you were so skilled with your hands! Oh! -That was so sweet! -Ooh! -I'm embarrassed for both of them. -Makes me a little vomitous. -Now. Cute. [WHISTLE] -Getting hot in here, ain't it? -Hot? The hottest boys, and twice as heated. -Yeah. -Whatever that means, I don't know. -How come that never happens to me? -You ain't got lucky, Chrissy! [CONSTRUCTION SOUNDS] JOSEPH (OFFSCREEN): Hey, Buddy! Buddy, are you there? Buddy! -Joe! Hey! JOSEPH (OFFSCREEN): Hi! -Hi, what are you doing? [SHOUTING] -Come on up! [DOOR KNOCK] -Yeah, just a sec. Hey! -Come on in. JOSEPH (OFFSCREEN): How are you doing? -I'm OK. -You see Greta? -Yeah, she gave me a job. -Yeah? -Yeah, washing dishes. Hey, people there are kind of funny, aren't they? -Yeah, they're great. I brought you something. This will help you get oriented. -Oh, what is it? -It's just a map. -Oh, wow! -Hold that thing. Some tape. -A subway map! Oh, it's great. -Now look. This is where I live, Brooklyn. You have to dial 718 first-- the area code-- then the number. There you go. -Hey, thanks a lot, Joe. [EXHALE] -Hey, um, can I get you some pop? -Pop? -Yeah. -No thanks. -You sure? -Positive. -Did you just take a picture of me? -Yep. -I wasn't even looking at you! [LAUGH] -Don't worry about it. -You want some chips? -Ah, no thanks. -These are good ones. You sure? -Very. Some friends of mine are doing a performance piece at, uh, PS 122 tonight. Would you like to come? -I've got to go to work tonight. -Mm, too bad. So the job is goo-- the job's going OK? -Yeah, it's great. It's really easy, you know. It's not like farm work. -Look, I've got to see a lot of people before tonight. Uh, give me a call sometime. -You're leaving? -Yeah. Ciao! -Good bye, Joe. Thank you! -You know-- [SIGH] ---I don't know how I ended up owning a fucking restaurant. I'm an actress. I want to be in Chekhov. -Buddy, run downstairs and get us some rice. -Where is it? -It's in the bin downstairs. -Nice butt on that boy. -Adorable. Frankly, I'd have to see it bare to make a proper judgement. -Oh, he's so sweet. -Dumb is more like it. -Hey, dumb can be fun. -Yeah, yeah. I had a cousin like that once. We had to shoot him. -Excuse me. Sorry. [SIGH] -Please, please, please, Angelo, come back to work! Please! We're too busy. It's a madhouse. -(LAUGHING) It's OK. Um, listen. Um, call me tomorrow. -Yeah. -Yeah, I should be home all morning. But, just in case I'm not, my mother can take a message. -OK. -Angelo. -Hey, how are you doing? -Good. How are you? -Good. -How's school? -Pretty good. -Good. -Good night. -Oh, OK. -Good bye. -Keep plugging on it. -All right. -Hi, Buddy. -Hi, George. -How did it go tonight? -Hey, it was OK. -A lot easier? -Yeah. -Yeah, it was busy. I can tell. -It was. -Just look at this place. It's a mess! [LAUGH] -I know, I know. -Yeah. You're getting the knack of it? -Yup. -Good. -It's getting easier. -Well, like I said, routine! -I know. -We could probably teach it to a gorilla. [LAUGH] -Buddy? -Yeah? -Did I ever tell you about the face on Mars? -I don't think so. -The human face on the surface of Mars? -There's somebody's head on the surface on Mars? -Yeah, you got it. -How did somebody get up there? -Well, that's a long story. You know, when they sent the probe up, the Viking probe? -Yeah. -And they got back these thousands and thousands of pictures of the surface of Mars? -Yeah. -They found one that showed a face. -A face? -Yeah, a face. -A head? -Yup, a head. -A human head? -On the surface of Mars? -Yeah. At first they thought, you know, maybe it's a reflection off the stone, maybe it's a natural rock formation, or maybe even a flaw in the lens of the camera. You know, these things do happen. -Yeah. -But then they found another photo. This one was taken from a different angle, but of the same spot. And there's the same face staring up at them. -Wait, is it maybe, like, a person? Or is it-- -Yeah. No, it's got the eyes, the nose, the teeth, everything. -It's made out flesh, and it's, like-- -No, no, no. Stone. They figure it's stone. It's 1 mile long, 1 mile wide, and 1 mile high. -It's like craters, right? It's like the man on the moon. -No, no, no. It's a face. It's a sculpted face. They ran a computer readout on this, and they found out it was so perfectly sculpted that an artist must have done it. -You should have Simon's face when those plates started coming back untouched. -Oh! [LAUGH} -I didn't want to. I stayed and didn't come near the kitchen. Ah! -I was afraid to put my orders up after that. [LAUGHTER] -I know! -One theory is that one time, there was an ancient civilization of Martians there and they built the face. -They, that's all that is left, is just this face? -Just a face. Well, a few pyramids scattered around here and there on planet. -Pyramids? -But then there's-- -Like Egyptians went to Mars and they build this face and their pyramids? -Yeah, yeah. In fact, the face looks a bit like an Egyptian. It has a headdress around it. -I don't get it. -Well, you know, neither do they. That's why they're studying it and they want to send another probe. -You have pictures of this? -Plenty of pictures. I've got a book on it. -Bring it in. I want to see it, because I don't believe it. -Definitely. -It was so busy tonight. -Yeah, my feet are killing me. -Yeah, mine too. So, um, how was it taking caring of that couple with the baby? [LAUGH] -Yeah, horrible as usual. -Ugh. They were the worst tonight. -Yeah, yeah. That child won't eat anything that's brought, brought to it. -How many times did they return the food? -I think at least three. [SIGH] -Simon was climbing the walls. He didn't know what to do. -And between that and that woman that I had who returned her food without even tasting it, Ah! -I don't think-- -I can't believe it. -Now, the second theory, which is the one that really interests me, is that we put it there. -But we've never been to Mars. -Well, how do you know? You know, what if there was an advanced civilization here, maybe, what? 2, 3 million years ago? They developed space travel. So what did they do? After they go to the moon, they go to Mars. And what's the first thing they do? -Build a face? -No. [LAUGH] -They set up a resort. A re-- [LAUGH} -Yeah. -No. No, a resort. Then with the resort comes a casino. Then one day the casino's-- -This-- ---not doing too good. [LAUGH] -So what do they do? They figured they needed a little promo device. -So they build a face? -So they build a face. [LAUGH} -They got maybe lights coming out of it, you know, flashing off and on. And maybe a laser message coming out of the mouth shooting off into space. -I don't get it. I don't think so. -Why not? This way, the spaceships going by, they see it. And they go down and spend their money, and you've got a successful resort. But then one day the civi, civilization just goes kapooey. You know, like most civilizations do sooner or later. [LAUGH] -And there's nothing left on the face of the earth of it. But then in our time, they find the face on Mars. -I think you're shitting me. -No, no. -I don't believe a word of this. -Buddy, would I lie about something as sacred and holy as a human face on the planet lost? -I, I don't know you well enough. --Come on! -Maybe you would! -No. I mean, there's plenty of things I'd lie about, but that's not one of them! [LAUGH] -But you don't do that in restaurants. That was despicable. -Well, you tell her that. -Yeah, really. -Mm-hmm. -How about, um, Terri? You know that woman that comes in all the time? -Oh, Ms. Mary Kay? -Hey, Buddy? -Ugh. -Telephone! -That was awful. -Yeah, what a pain. [SIGH] -You know, Ricky? [SIGH] -I, I really have the worst crush on Buddy. He's really so cute and he's so refreshing. -Well, I don't know how to tell you this, but, um, he's already got one boyfriend and he's working on a second one. -Yeah, I sort of figured that was what was going on. So, uh, when are we going to get some good-looking straight guys around here? -Beats me! [LAUGHTER] -Oh well. -It's a big question in this city, you know. -Yeah, I guess so. -Yeah. -Hello? Hey, Joe. Yeah, I'm, I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, it's getting much easier. I'm getting used to it now. [LAUGH] -Um, well, I just have a couple more things to do. You know, this guy George in the kitchen's telling me this story about the man on Mars. Have you ever hear-- yeah, really? Yeah? So, um, what are you up to now? Y, you think maybe you want to get together tonight? [LAUGH] -You know, Buddy. -Yeah? -You really ought to call yourself Edward. -Yeah! [LAUGH] -Nobody calls me Edward! -Well, it is your real name, isn't it? -So what? -People will take you more seriously. -Yeah? -You should be proud of it. -Yeah? [LAUGH] -Give me a break, would you? [GROWL] -Hey, look at those photographs over there. Some pictures I took. [LAUGH] -Let me see. You can't even tell what these things are! Wow, look at these people. Weird shirt this guy's got on. Look at these people. [CLEARS THROAT] -I've got a couple of shirts. Too small for me. -Joe, you don't have to give me anything. [COUGH] -Here, take these. -You think I'm going to walk around the streets wearing this stuff? -Yes, I do. [LAUGH] -Here. Here, take them all. [COUGH] -Yeah, what do you think? -Looks great. -This shirt, this shirt's too small for you? [LAUGH] -They're yours, now. -I think I have to grow a bit to fit into it. -Just wear them! -So Joe, when did you first come here? -To New York? -Yeah. [CLEARS THROAT] -Oh god. Let's see, I was 16. I moved out of my parents' house. We just weren't getting along. [CLEARS THROAT] -I stayed in Chicago for about two more years. Uh, I was in a band with a couple friends. We moved here to play. -Really? You're in a band? -No. We moved out of, uh, Chicago. New York, we came here, and that was over. I went to, uh, art school. I was painting. An old boyfriend of mine was a photographer. He taught me a lot. That's how I got into it. -So you've seen lots of guys? -Hm. I lost count years ago. -What was your first one? -My first? -Yeah, your first one. [EXHALE] -Let's see. [SIGH] [COUGH] -How old were you? -I guess I was about five years old, if you can believe it. [LAUGH] -No, I don't believe it. -Well, I mean, you can't do much sexually at the age of five. His name was, was Arthur. He lived down the street from me. -What did you do with him? -Uh, well, we'd mostly, he'd come over to my house or I'd go over to his house. Sometimes we'd stay out in a tent and just play around with each other. [CLEARS THROAT] -Uh, we were going to school. He'd come over and it got a little more intense. We were more, we were getting to become more experimental. [CHUCKLE] [SIGH] -I guess it was towards the end of grammar school. We were, like, playing with each other and we began sucking each other off. [LAUGH] -Wow. -He was the head of the swim team. He'd come over to my house every day except for the weekend. And we were getting, like, really involved with each other. We began, like, fucking each other and sucking each other off on a regular basis. Last I heard, uh, he got married. -Really? -Well, then I've had a few long-term relationships. Uh, Robert the photographer. And mostly, mostly pickups in the last couple of years. -Hey, Joe. -Yeah? -Don't you think maybe you'll get AIDS seeing so many different guys? [LAUGH] -No, I don't think I'll get AIDS. Give me those. Look, we've got some things we have to clear up right here and now. There's some things you have to do every time. The rules. And if you do, you'll be OK. -Yeah. -Masturbation is fine. Kissing is fine. If you get fucked, use a rubber every time. All right? Never give anyone blow job. [LAUGH] -Listen to me. These are rules we have to follow every time with everyone you're with. If you do, you'll be all right. -OK. -Look, nothing we did tonight was dangerous. OK? -Sure. [EXHALE] [CLEARS THROAT] [EXHALE] -So when was your first? -When I was 16 with this girl. She, um, she got her father's car and-- eh, well, she was more into it than I was. -Well, what about guys? When was that? -It was with you! -With me? -Yes! -You're kidding. -[SNORT] -No. [LAUGH] [CONVERSATION IN CHINESE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGH] [CARS HORNS] [METAL CLANGING] [POLICE SIREN] [CAR HORNS] -Close the door. -Sure. -Ray, some money. I have enough to get us some after the movie. -Oh, I've got some money too. -OK. -I guess we're all set. I'm going to put on my shoes before we go. -Sure. -OK. BUDDY (OFFSCREEN): This desk is great. Where did you get this? -Isn't that nice? My great-grandmother gave it to me. BUDDY (OFFSCREEN): Anthropology. You're studying this? -Yeah. That's my major in college, and computer science, my minor. My uncle works at the, uh, Museum of Natural History, and he's pretty sure he can get me a job there when I graduate. If I can't get the job, if I don't like it, I can always get something with the computer science, though. BUDDY (OFFSCREEN): You're gay, huh? -No kidding. -Your parents know? -Yeah, my mother does. Actually, it's cool with her. I think sometimes it raises me in her eyes. My father I don't talk to much. They're divorced and I just don't talk to him. How about your folks? BUDDY (OFFSCREEN): My sister sort of knows, I think. -Yeah. -But I don't think my parents even know what it means. [LAUGH] -I just couldn't take it up there anymore. -Why not? -All these guys and their girlfriends. I used to think if I tried really hard, I could fit in. I kept waiting to change. You know, when I was in high school, I saw this TV talk show from New York with these three guys on it called "Consultations with Three." -Consulta-- what's that? -It's what these three guys called themselves. They said they used to be gay, but they took some kind of course or something and, and now they're, like, married with girlfriends or something. -What? -They're straight. -That's, that's not true. Come on! -Yeah. No, what's they said. -That's television. -Well no, they said that. And I wrote down the number. And I thought, well, someday I'm gonna come to New York and I'd check it out, you know? But when I was packing last week, I couldn't find the number. I lost it. But I didn't know what New York could be like. -Buddy, don't worry about it. Mm, I just stopped trying to figure it out a long time ago. Some people are, some people aren't. That's all. It's, it's not a big deal in New York. -Yeah, you're probably right. ANGELO (OFFSCREEN): So what did you do after high school? -I watched TV for about six months. [LAUGH] -And I got a job in the dairy farm. -Really? What did you do? -Oh, I did a little bit of everything. It was a family farm. They usually needed a couple extra guys to help out. ANGELO (OFFSCREEN): Cows and stuff like that? -Yeah, about 200 cows. ANGELO (OFFSCREEN): 200 cows? -Yeah. ANGELO (OFFSCREEN): Wow. It must take a long time to milk 200 cows. -I didn't do it by myself. It took about an hour, usually, you know. ANGELO (OFFSCREEN): Wow. -We had five different milking machines. ANGELO (OFFSCREEN): Oh, you use milking machines? -Yeah, what do you think? It'd take forever otherwise. ANGELO (OFFSCREEN): I thought everybody-- -Then we'd have to shovel out the stalls, take the cows out to pasture. ANGELO (OFFSCREEN): Cow shit? -Yeah, plenty of cow shit. [LAUGH] -What would, what would you do with all the cow shit? [SNORT] -You ever hear about cow pies, huh? -Mm-mm. No. [LAUGH] -Never mind. Uh, we'd make a big pile of it out behind the barn. We used it for fertilizer later. Hey, you know, one time, one of Mr. Richmond's sons-- Mr. Richmond was the guy who owned the place. -Yeah. -His son was up on top of the roof, you know-- -Yeah. ---fixing a leak. Stood up too fast, got really dizzy, fell right over like this into the cow shit! [LAUGH] -He died? -No, he didn't die. It wasn't that far of a drop. He didn't even get hurt. -Oh. -But he was covered with it, you know? It was, like, coming out of his mouth and his eyes, up his nose. He really stank, too. [LAUGH] -Buddy? You want to skip the movie? Stay here? My mother's not coming back until tomorrow. -You think it's OK? -Sure it's OK. [LAUGHTER] -Hey, let's get undressed first. [EXHALE] JOSEPH (OFFSCREEN): Look, Buddy. You know you can't afford to stay in that room much longer. BUDDY (OFFSCREEN): It's OK. I still got money saved. -I know, but wouldn't it be nice if you stayed here for a while? While you're looking for a place. -I couldn't do that. -Why not? -It wouldn't be fair to you. -Look, you don't have enough shifts to cover $120 a week. I've got lots of room here. Here, take these. -That's real nice of you, Joe. -It's no big deal. -You know, Sandy at work says that she might have a place opening up in her apartment at the end of the month, so I'd only be here for, like maybe two weeks. -Stay as long as you like. [LAUGH] -Thanks, Joe. -Sure. I hope you didn't do anything dangerous with this kid. -He knows all the rules. -Are you going to see him again? -I don't know. He's a nice guy. -Look, I'm not saying don't sleep with him. Just make sure everything's safe, all right? Come on, do you want to go to breakfast? -Yeah, sure. -Oh, can I call my folks, first? -Sure. Uh, I'm just going to go get some cigarettes. -OK. -I'll be back. -Hi, Judy. Yeah. No, I'm fine. I-- Hi, mom. Everything's OK. No, no. Yes, everything's fine. Yeah, I'm in New York. I'm staying with a friend of mine. I just met him a couple of nights ago. He's really a nice guy. [SIGH] -Yeah, mom, I know. I'm, I'm sorry. I just, I just had to get away, that's all. I don't know. I think, I think maybe I'll have to stay around here a while longer. I just wanted to see what it was like down here. I know, mom. Look, you don't have to worry. I even got a job in a restaurant here. Well, Joe says I can crash here for a while until I find a place of my own. He's just, he's just a guy I'm staying with. Look, mom, mom, mom, mom, let me, let me talk to dad for a minute, OK? Yeah. Yes, yes, I understand you. Hi, dad. How are you doing? No, no, no, I'm fine. Yeah, everything's great. [LAUGH] -Yeah, I've got enough money to live on. Yeah? Which, which, Pizza Hut? Downtown or the mall? Yeah, salad bar is good there. Hey, you know something? I got a job in a restaurant here. [LAUGH] -Yeah. No, no, no. It pays fine. Mm, yeah, you know, I thought I would hang around here a while longer. I've, I've been meeting lots of nice people. Sure, sure. Yeah, I love you too, dad. OK, put her on. Hey, Judy. No, no, no, no, no, I'm not mad anymore. Hey, it's, it's OK. I just don't want to talk about it, OK? Yeah, I've been to lots of places. You know, as soon as I got here, I went to the top of the Empire State Building. Yeah, it was great. And yesterday I went to, uh, Chinatown with this guy, Angelo. He, he works in this restaurant where I got a job. Yeah. Anyway, you know, Chinatown was really cool. It was like we're not in America anymore. And we went to Little Italy. Yeah, they do! [LAUGH] -It's all Italian this and that, you know. We, we sat outside and ate pastries and had cappuccino coffee, and we walked around by the river for a while. It was-- yeah, yeah. And I know, I heard. I heard. Tell her I'll give it to me before I hang up. Hey, I've been meeting lots of people. [LAUGH] -Joe took me to this party the other day. He's just some guy I'm staying with. He's a great guy! Leave him alone! He's a photographer. He used to be in his own rock band. He knows lots of artists, too. Painters. Dancers, too. And performance artists. Well, I'm not really sure. I had to work the night that Joe was going to take me to see this guy. But they put on shows every week at this old school around here. Well, hey, you know, Judy, I went over to this party. I tried cocaine. Hey, don't tell her! Don't tell her! I'm gonna tell her about the time-- hey! [LAUGH] -Well, I don't know if I could really feel it, you know. It was, it was, um, maybe like I had more energy or something. Yeah, I spent a lot of time dancing with this really nice girl. Yeah, she's a dancer and a waitress, too. Hey, well, you know what life is like in the big city, right? Hey, Judy, Judy, Judy, let me talk to mom before I get into any more trouble. Come on, I've got to give her the number anyway. Sure, sure. And if I'm not around, just, uh, leave a message with Joe. He'll be glad to take it, yeah. Or you can put it on his answering machine. Yeah, sure, mom. Yeah. I love you too, mom. Thanks, mom. Um, bye bye. Bye, see ya. Whew! -Come on, you want to go? -Yeah, now I'm really hungry! [MUSIC PLAYING] MR. FIELDS (OFFSCREEN): Hey, I don't care if he falls for a girl or a boy, as long as he stays off drugs.
