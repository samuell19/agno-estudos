Henry, my brooch! What for? - No, not that! Brooch! - Which one? - It's on my desk! - Aha. Let me do it myself! Just think! Professor Alfonso himself will be there! - Alfonso? Who's that? - The famous Brazilian! - Oh, he's here again? - He's never been here before! - Rose darling, I'm sure you'll get the Nobel Prize - Go on... - No, you'll see...! - Did you feed the animals? - Yes. - Go and fetch Czar. - Yes. Oh! Come on then now! Be a good dog! Don't get me into trouble again! Have you shut the cages? - Yes. - How's No 3? - Which one? - The rabbits that's had an injection yesterday. - Something wrong with it! - Why, is it off its feed? - No, it has such a malignant stare. - The rabbits are here for my experiments not for my amusement! Come on, Czar! Now, go ahead! Alright. Push! OK. ...we've welded on a few supports. It was Zdenek's idea. Now it can't fall down again! - Think so? - Go to it... Be careful! Start pulling! - I'm there. ...the supports are a lot stronger than before. It'll not fall now! - Look out!!! Down again! - I'm throwing in the towel! We need to come up with something! You're right there. Watch out! He's coming! Hide it, quick! Well, girls, it's down again... A coffee, please, Ivanka. Got a call from the shop. What's wrong? - It just dropped again. - I know! What do you propose now? - Something to stop it falling. - Yes, but what? - Something light, small, powerful... - And inexpensive! - Sorry? - Inexpensive! - Thank you! - Just so you know - from this moment on, it's your job and you take full responsibility for it! Don't waste time, use your head! Break a leg! And shut that safe! You'd better use something else for the larder, girls. WHO WANTS TO KILL JESSIE? THE TECHNICAL REVUE Thank you. ...wants to kill Jessie... LIKE THAT! THE MIDNIGHT BEFORE: I'LL FINISH MY INVENTION TONIGHT! AT LAST! JESSIE MAKES THE GREATEST INVENTION OF ALL TIME! Anti-gravitational gloves... It's easy for her! FANTASTIC RESULTS! NOW FOR A GOOD REST. AAAH! POWERFUL FISTS NEED POWERFUL GLOVES! YOUR END IS NIGH! TO BE CONTINUED! Who's is this? Mine. From the library. - Get me the whole serial! Is everything ready? All the guests present? - Yes, Sir. - Professor Alfonso too? - Yes. And I've put a cushion just as you said, under his... - Yes, yes! Thank you! Now just relax. Everything will turn out fine. Your efforts must bear fruit. Is the patient ready? - Yes sir. When I was putting her under the darn cow kicked me. - There's no need to be rude! - Sorry, professor. - Let us go, dear colleagues! - Nobody missing? - Dear colleague, right foot first! Please? - If you please. - No, no, no, no, no! - This is your great day! - Break a leg! Ladies and gentlemen! At the close of our symposium Doctor Beránková is going to demonstrate the results achieved in her research. If you please, doctor! Dear colleagues! My experiment is meant to demonstrate the possibility of influencing dreams. The patient chosen for this experiment suffers in her sleep from visions that have an adverse effect on her state of mind. We can use Wiseman's picture-tube to see the patient's dreams. Mr. Kolbaba, the blinds! We see that in her dreams, she's being plagued by gad-flies. I think that's enough, thank you. Mr. Kolbaba, lights! As you can see, an unpleasant nightmare indeed. No wonder the patient is yielding less milk than before. And now... We are going to inject a solution which I have named KR6. Don't take photographs, please! It will take effect immediately. Kindly proceed, dear colleague! Mr. Kolbaba, the curtain! And now the results of the dream treatment for our patient. The preparation is taking effect. The gad-flies have disappeared. Tuning, please! Mr. Kolbaba, light! The troublesome element in the dream has been removed effectively. And superseded by reposeful tranquillity. This phenomenon I have termed somnioreparation. Ladies and gentlemen! Somniology, the science of dreams, has now progressed to where we are able to rid patients of undesirable dreams and replace them with ones beneficial for the dreamer's psychological stability and productivity. - Thank you. So now to the debate. So, who has a... Yes! - I would firstly congratulate my colleague. Her discovery is of far-reaching importance. If you consider that we can thus healthily influence the dreams of millions of people - this will be possible soon - that is, to influence in the socio-political sense. Yes, it is amazing! Simply amazing! - Yes, my preparation may have a salutary effect on the evolution of all mankind! - Yes, but we are scientists we don't have the right to interfere in people's dreams for whatever doctrine! - It is exactly because we are are scientists! We have to know what's good or bad for humanity! - Exactly! Not even dreams can be to develop willy-nilly! - Pardon. Professor Alfonso. Please. Can you enlighten me on a small technical detail? What becomes of the unpleasant dreams? - Dreams are just mental images which can't materialize or turn into energy. They simply disappear! WHO WANTS TO KILL JESSIE? JESSIE IN HER LAB AGAIN: I MUST INTENSIFY THEIR POWER... LATER: NOW TO SEE WHATWE CAN DO! Now! TWO... THREE! ...AND YOU'RE FLYING AGAIN! WHO'S FOLLOWING ME? OH! MY STRAP! LET'S WRECK THE LAB! ...BUT GIVE IT A ONCE OVER FIRST! SECRET PASSAGE WILL JESSIE ESCAPE? AND WHERE NOW? TO BE CONTINUED! Henry! It was wonderful! A pity you didn't see my success. Professor Keller has offered me a lecture-tour... We had a gorgeous dinner afterwards. Have you eaten yet? - Yes. - I could still do with a little... - What? What would you like? - Roast chicken! - Chicken. Where can I get some chicken now? - In the fridge. - We've got some? - Yes, in the fridge. Wait! Wait! You must toast my success with me! - I don't mind if I do... Rose, here's to your success! - Oh, Henry darling... And what have you been doing all day? - Oh, the usual... Targets... Planning... What have you got that's so important, darling? - Just an idea, Rose dear. - It won't run away. Bedtime! - I'd like to finish it. - What do you mean? It's Thursday today, isn't it? Oh yes, sorry... got to sleep... Are you coming? What's up with you? What are you doing in here? It's Thursday! Aha! Today's Thursday... Alright. Henry...! - Sorry, dear! What do you want? TELL US THE SECRET OF THE GLOVES! I know nothing about it! I know nothing! What are you doing? Don't do anything foolish! No! No! No, wait! Is it stainless steel at least? Help! Help! No! No! Thank you. FOLLOW ME! Alright then! Careful! Good grief! Damn! What a weight! How is it possible? Miss, those gloves, they have... amazing power! We could use them in our factory. You know how they work? OF COURSE, BUT NO TIME NOW! - Aha. But it's... It's anti-gravitation, isn't it? PST! BACK! What are they trying to do? What's all this? Madmen! They wouldn't dare! You'll regret this... No! Leave her alone! Hear me? You scoundrels! Villains! Stop, I say! It's that crazy one again! What are the candles for?! What are they...? Phew! Hold on, Jessie, hold on! What are they up to? A LITTLE SURPRISE! What surprise? Wait! Wake up, Miss Jessie! Wake up! Hello! The gloves! We must get them! I need them desperately! UNDO THE KNOT!!!! Aha. Careful! Careful, girl, so I don't bite you! That's it. Henry! Wake up! - What? - Wake up! - Rosie, where are the gloves? - What was all that? Who was that woman? - Which woman? But, but... - Yes, the one you bit! Why did you bite her? And where? - Rosie... - You'll wreck our marriage! - But she's only a child! - Beast! - But Rosie, it... It is not about her but the gloves! It's the antigravitational gloves! Miss Jessie has... - I'll show her! Off to your bed! - What are you going to do? Rose... - Off with you! - Rose... - I said scoot! - Those gloves... What is it? - Nothing! It's my preparation. - What preparation? - Mine! It's world-famous! - Rosie, the gloves... I need these dreams! - I know what you need! Get ready! - No! Your forearm! There you are. Why don't you dream about me? Henry! Time to get up! Rose, Rosie, are you alright? Rosie, what's happened? - Henry... in the bath... What's in the bath? What's wrong, Rosie? YOUR NAME IS HENRY? Henry! What's this? - Oh, just a speech bubble. - Hurry up! I saw a man in the bath! - In the bathroom? That's a different one! - He looks pretty angry! Rosie... GOOD MORNING! Oh, Henry...! Rosie, it's them! - Which them? - Well, it's her! From the... Which her? - From the... from the magazine. Wait! Wait! Oh... she's the... The one you were dreaming about! - Of course! - This is impossible! She has materialized after the injection! And all those flies... - What flies? - We have to lock them in! - The flies? - My God! To have such creatures in one's flat...! Wait, wait! Not in there! - My shirts are in there. - I'm not letting you in there. - But Rosie! They are my dreams, aren't they? - And nothing to be proud of! Hurry up, I have to go to the Institute. - I have a lecture and can't show up naked! - You can buy a shirt somewhere. Hurry up! - Why are you always hurrying me? It's not nearly ten yet! - I won't leave you alone here. - Should I open it? - Don't you dare! - She may be needing something! - Don't you worry about such... Phooey! So we're leaving the child alone with those ruffians? - It's not your business! - Business... business... I'm surprised at you! - Let's go! - I hardly recognize you this morning. Come on, Czar! I can't behave like this towards them! I have a certain obligation. - What obligation could you have? Obligation... surely not to that girl! - Oh, Rosie! - Good morning! - Good morning Mrs. Kokeš! Look, we left that fellow alone in the bathroom. What if he uses your toothbrush? - You just want to let them out! - But they aren't criminals! And we have no right to... - No right! Such apparitions have no right to liberty! Come now, Czar! - Why not? - Just come along... THEY'VE IMPRISONED US! FREEDOM FOR DREAMS! WHERE ARE THE GLOVES? I DON'T KNOW!!! LIAR!! HELLO! Kokeš speaking. I know you can hear me. What is going on? Little Paul couldn't sleep all night and now this terrible row! You're making my wife ill... And I'm going to be late for work! We have as much right... Ex... Ex... Excuse me. Vladimir! Dear colleague, after your demonstration, the operating theatre was full of gad-flies. We suspect that this was connected to your experiment. Can you explain it? - But how could that happen? - I don't know! But you will have to carry out a test. At once! We could try it right now, professor. Mr. Kolbaba seems to be dreaming. All right. - Gentlemen. Over here, professor. He's dreaming about beer... Just beer... Half a vial, please! This way, professor. Milk. That will do, I think. Sorry. Wow... that's amazing! - It's terrible! - Oh yes, of course, terrible! - The dreams have materialized! The presence of gad-flies has been explained... But I want nothing more to do with your preparation! - Excuse me, professor, but is this actually real beer? - May I... - Go ahead. - Thank you. - Come on, apply yourself! - Oh? There we are. - Good lord, doctor that would be a sinful waste! I happen to have some experience in this field... just let me... It's Pilsner, the genuine stuff! Have a sip, professor! I will no longer tolerate any such experiments at this institute! Kolbaba. - Yes? Are you feeling alright? - Yes. Look. You may drink all this beer as part of our experiment. - Thank you, doctor. - But first of all, go to my flat. Here are the keys. There you will find some people. Two men and... well, not exactly people. Take them to the train station and buy them tickets to... somewhere far away. - Yes, Madam. - And watch them until they leave. - Yes. - Do you understand? - Yes, of course! - Here... - What's this money for? - For the train tickets! - Somewhere far away, alright. - Exactly. - Think what would happened if someone had some absurd dream and the visions ran amok in the street? A catastrophe! So that's clear, Ivanka? You'll give the young lady a coat, she's dressed... of course. And bring her here. - Yes. - Money for a taxi... and the keys. Buy something for the men to eat, and a few bottles of beer. Tell them to wait for me. - OK. - Helen... please... - What? Here's the diagram, test it! But it has to be flat go it can be put onto a glove. And don't forget to get the transistors! Five minutes to ten, darn it... - Good grief! - Alright. - Ivanka, tell them not to make a mess! - Alright. ...this diagram may in the future become the basis for developing an antigravitational field in which a man might be able to lift the heaviest objects without effort. A Utopia, a dream perhaps. But we know that human dreams can be very creative, and if we give them wings, we will climb the highest peaks! SHE'S ESCAPED! THE SECRET OF THE GLOVES! What do you think you're doing? Get down from here at once! The water's still running! Switch off the water! Silence, please! - Everybody quiet! - Now, one after the other! - Hello. - Hello. - You've got a leak. - Yes, OK. Now, what happened? - They burst through the wall, tore down the phone... - That's not all! They broke the water pipes and drank all little Paul's milk. I want you to write this all down. ...they broke my broom and a flower-pot... Hello. - Hello. - Is this Dr. Beránek's flat? - Yes. So you're the young lady. Where are the others? You're going on a journey! - I can't. I've come to fetch the girl. - Which girl? - This is for you. And you are... not to make a mess! - Oh, thank you. - That's what the doctor said. - Well, you're going away, anyway! Well then. Where are those men? Aha! That'll be them! You're going on a journey! Please, let me through! - Make room here! Stop crowding! You are under arrest! - And you're going on a train! Hey you! Look out! - Look out! No.5 calling! No.5! A woman has just jumped into the sewers. Almost naked, I say, and then a man jumped after her! What? Two, yes. Wait! No! Three! Yes, that'll be them. What? Guard the sewers? Yes, sir! Please sir, what time is it? DAMNED!!!! But I can't read, sir! What on earth are you doing? Go on then! Run after them! BURP! Stop! Come down! - Get up there, quick! Your identity card! After them! Be quiet, this is a school! Hello? I do not maintain that technical fantasy as found in serials and in science fiction should be underestimated. Of course, they exhibit many negative elements. - What elements, professor? - Well, those supermen, for example. They are simply frightening. But I would rather call your attention to... THEY'RE AFTER ME! Everybody, please! Come down here! Quickly, everybody over here! The stronger ones, start barracading the door. Quickly! Professor, what's the meaning of this? - Sorry! I'll explain - this young lady is my dream. - I have no objection to that, but kindly dream off the premises! LET'S GO! Stop! Come back! It's them! At them, boys! Hooray! Let go of me! Sir, I categorically demand that you stop dreaming immediately! Hang in there, rector! Yes? - Pardon. - You don't think you're going too far? - No, it's a regular fight! Sir, we seem to have won. Handcuffs! Please consider this incident an internal affair of this Institute. Shoot him down! Remember you are on academic ground! Doctor, in the name of the law, I am ending your lecture. Serg... lieuten... Thank you. One, two, three... You say I bit through the water pipe? Use your head, man, can't you? Of course I'm angry! With these teeth? - So who then? - Who... What are you doing here? - He burst through the wall, bit through a water pipe and stole a child's milk! - Oh my God, the milk again? - You've made a pig's ear of it. Let them go! - I'm sorry. You can go! - Yes, but where? We've already missed the train. Let's catch the next one! - I'm not going anywhere. - How come? - That must be the young woman. - Right! Excuse me, I'm Kolbaba. I have orders from professor Beránková. Miss, you're coming on a journey. Why did you want to send those people away? Firstly, they are not actually people. Better call them visions. - But we cannot sue visions for damages! Or do you think we can? You are here as an expert in the field of dreams! - In my opinion, we can't sue them... But we can sue the dreamers. I say, Rose... But that... Thank you. We've known each other for so long... And you call me a dreamer? But I only... - Don't call me Rosie! You are the defendant. And if you dreamed about your wife you wouldn't be here. Silence, please! Thank you, professor! But what next? We have damage done to property, we have Professor Beránek and his dreams. The court must come to a decision. WHAT TO DO IN THE SLAMMER Defendant! What is your relationship with your dreams? Well... They are my dreams. You admit you are their owner. Even if we do not consider the question of whether it is ethical for a person to own another person, the important fact remains that once the defendant had such dreams, he should have taken steps to prevent them becoming a public nuisance. So I propose: Firstly that he be banned from dangerous dreaming, and secondly that he be condemned for towards his wards. - I protest! The defendant's dreams relate to matters beneficial for all mankind! More precisely, special gloves that use anti-gravity and could result in unheard-of... - But where are these gloves? They are still only a dream... But this young lady can confirm it. Miss, would you kindly tell us, I mean produce one of those bubbles to clarify everything? I LOVE YOU! Well, there you are. Turn it so the recorder can see it. Thank you! The court will now withdraw for consultation. The problem of course remains of what to do with those creatures. Forbid... one can forbid anything. But to forbid somebody's existence? - Perhaps the doctor could develop a sort of antidote to send them back into dreams. - That would take years of scientific research. - Or just a moment of inspiration, professor! As the expert, you are undoubtedly in the best position to resolve this. The court will send them to your institute. Oh, excuse me! ...Pursuant to § 265/1/36 paragraph 12 of the Criminal Law, the defendant Henry Beránek is sentenced herewith to three days imprisonment. Defendant, do you accept the sentence? Yes. I declare the proceedings to be closed. I LOVE YOU! Come along then! Here are your paper bags. You're to glue them. - A pencil, please. - That's forbidden! But you can't write on the bags! - No? - No. - So where can I write? I'm not giving you advice, but people usually do their scrawling here. - Thank you. One moment! Please, what happened to the people I dreamed up? I'll find out. - Thanks. Well, we could keep them in cages for observation, like mice. Observe whom? That woman? - We don't have big enough cages. My job is to remove them. And that is what I will do. I know what has to be done. - By removal, you mean... If we don't hesitate to destroy troublesome insects what's the problem with chimeras? Mr. Kolbaba! Yes, doctor. - Take the three... I repeat they are not human beings! ...and... do what needs doing... I think you understand me. - Not exactly! Good Lord, you're not serious! I don't even kill rabbits. I leave it to my mother-in-law. I just couldn't... - You're disappointing me, Kolbaba! - Well, um... - I thought you were a real man! - Me? - If I were you... - Excellent! So you do it. - Oh, but doctor... - I have spoken, You're in charge of the operation! - But... - Under my personal supervision. And meanwhile you'll be working on the antidote. Good grief, what's this? - I couldn't really explain to you in three days. - I know! This is mathematics! Go on writing. Hope I don't have to pay to get this cleaned up. What have they done with the girl and those... - Your wife was put in charge of them. - This is terrible! Please, call this number. Ask for Miss Ivanka and dictate her these three numbers. Oh yes! Three. I appreciate the pious atmosphere. - Yes, we treat them almost as human beings. - Then, of course, the lady should have precedence. - I'm not going to retie them! One by one! - And the temperature is stable? - Yep. - So if you would be so good... Let's proceed... Wow! The heat! Ashes to ashes... Something's burning here... Do it properly, it's for your own good. Look out with that thing! - Alright... - Can't you be more careful? - No talking! Got to refill it. Have a good evening! - See you in the morning! Enjoy it, lads! - Cheerio! - Cheerio! If you would, doctor. Death occurred... - Excuse me! - Sorry! The first delusion was removed at exactly 3:40pm. - Yes. Here? VERY REFRESHING! HOW MUCH DO I OWE? The shackles! The shackles have melted! - Don't just gape! At him! What a man! Who here did not admire his true, sporting spirit? ...the preparation A VII seems to be most promising. - Good. We have to focus all our energies on the antidote. As our colleague has been so disappointing... What could I do with that cursed fellow? Damn him! - Yes, he's some fellow! - Did you want something, doctor? There's something of the immortal in him. You can't stand that, can you? I'd like to tear him... - Yes. - Wait a moment! That's not a bad idea! Tear him in two! They couldn't withstand the critical tensile stress! - In that case, let's start with the girl. She's more fragile. - She'll just snap - like this! - And what will you use to tear them? Give it to me! Thanks. See? Here! Connect it! Take your time! Psssst! Girls - do you have them? The gloves, I mean! Aha! How far have you got? - We need the central computation. - I've got it here. Could you stay a little longer this evening? - But you said... - Thank you, I knew you would. I've got a mission for you, Ivanka... espionage. - Another train journey? - All right, step back there! I feel sorry for her! - Come, come... - As soon as I wave my handkerchief! And don't forget - reverse gear! Good Lord! Everybody can be re-educated, can't they? What's happened? - What's the meaning of this? I was about to give the signal! - I left my driving licence in my overcoat... - Just get back in the cab! 4,2 - Yes. - 4.3 - Yes. - Now try 4.7. Just the negative circuit! - All right. - Four... - Professor! - What? Have you found out something? Doctor... - Let me go! - Don't go there! - Doctor... Let me at him! 180 bhp. You see, there we are... Doctor! - Will you let me go! Let me go, Kolbaba, let me go! - I said I won't! And I won't! Doctor, please! Where are you going? - He's broken out of jail! What now! - Nothing works with him, anyway! - You're right! - Did you see him break the chain? - Untie him! Hurry up! - Don't just stand there! Help us! - Come on, help! That was a great idea, too! Steel cables... - The gloves! The secret of the gloves! Get them! THE BEASTS! Get in! Let's go! - You're coming with us, too! Start the engine! Just a moment! We must catch our dreams at all costs! Quicker, quicker! It is an important social duty. Step on it! Damnation! Get out, quick! After them! Now they can't get away! Hey... you! Stop! Quick! We're safe here! If we connect link BX to the primary circuit... What did you say? THE SECRET OF THE GLOVES! After them! You can rest here. BUT THIS IS YOUR BED! Don't worry about that. Just rest. Make yourself at home. I have to do my time, they said. I DON'T BITE, PROFESSOR! LET ME DO IT MYSELF! NO! It's Thursday! NO!!! Good morning! ERROR! Oh, the error! You've found it! That's marvellous! Pardon. What's this? I've never seen anything like this! - No wonder. It's a prototype. - I see. - And today is Friday, so I'm done here. Jessie, let's go! Look, my darling, I know how to get rid of that girl! The antidote is ready. One little prick and she'll be a dream again. Only a dog's dream this time! SLOWLY AND CLEARLY! Like this, darling! One prick... Careful! You might hurt yourself! My darling, my Hercules! HELP! Oh no! It's starting again! - Be quiet! No! Darling... I'll follow you! Good morning! Look, I need your budget for next month. Who are these two? - Ask them! DREAM WORKERS NEW WORKERS If you can tear yourself away from these games, do something useful and take a look at that crane bridge. Good Lord! Rose! Rose! Rosie! Oh, has she tied you up? Such a good doggie? Could it be? Darling! Wait for me! No, you won't get away from her my boy! DARLING! HENRY, TODAY ISN'T THURSDAY! Get out of here, Czar! Go onto the balcony, good dog! DARLING! You're not a dream any more, Jessie. You'll have to learn to speak. Try and say "darling". Like this! Watch me! DAR - LING. Dar... - Darling! But you'll only dream about me! Have you fed the dog? THE END
