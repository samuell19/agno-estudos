-Hello, Leslie. -Morning. Morning. Aaron. Aaron! Help! Aaron! SARA STEIN - MASADA Faster? Hanan, are you crazy? Take it easy. It’s incredible. Why’s Blok here already? He was at the Dead Sea for personal reasons. Probably with the woman he was with in Derriere. He was dancing like a whirling dervish and ignored me. Blok was dancing? It must be serious. My God, Hanan! -My God! -What? It looks like an accident. One person was injured: Avram Salzman. His son Aaron may still be in the tunnel. Avram Salzman is a hero in Israel. He’s had death threats in his time. We can assume it’s an attack. Yes. I’ll take care of it. But it may just have been an accident. Sara and Hanan are on their way. Wake up, Uri. Get on to the explosives guys. We owe it to Avram Salzman to secure his house. Get to it. All right. In Israel, everyone knows Avram Salzman. He’s the king of archaeology. He discovered Masada. He survived the Shoah. What about the son, Aaron Salzman? I don’t know him. Sadly. The police are searching for what caused the explosion, but so far there are no fatalities or casualties. It is not yet clear what happened. That’s him. …there was a serious explosion. The police are not treating this as a terrorist-- Hanan, you can question the witnesses. Mr. Salzman? My name is Sara Stein. Homicide Squad, Tel Aviv. I’m sorry for what’s happened. Homicide Squad? I don’t know. It’s pointless at the moment. My father can’t remember what happened. There’s some activity now. We don’t know what’s happening. It looks as though a casualty or a victim is being rescued. We can’t see who it is-- Aaron! …but perhaps we can find out. It’s hard to say but it seems several people are involved. We’ll try to get more information. Aaron. Aaron. I’m Elia Salzman, his son. And the brother. I drove my father here. When can I take him home? We’d like to ask you some questions. Why? I only got here when the accident-- Or was it a terrorist attack? I didn’t see what happened. Islamic groups who were against the excavations. We’ll find out if it was an accident or an attack. But not until we’ve completed our investigations. Our questions can wait until tomorrow. Can you drive? -Yes. -A police escort will see you home. Thank you. One of them can’t remember anything and the other saw nothing. Great… That could be true. Could you come here? Thank you. As it was Shabbat, nobody else was here. She and some others spent the night at the camp. Aaron slept here too. Did she see him this morning? No. She was on her way to see him when she heard the explosion. Mind you, she’s behaving like a grieving widow. Come on. Aaron was unique in caring about his students. We loved him. Why did you spend the night here? Because of Aaron? I didn’t feel like traveling back to Tel Aviv for one day. We were all here for Aaron’s scheduled explosion. What scheduled explosion? It was planned for this afternoon. It was important for the excavation. The explosives were in position. What’s the purpose of the excavation? It was for Aaron’s post doc. Leslie, do you think it was politically motivated? I’ve no idea. Aaron… he swam against the flow. You mean this research project? The whole Zionist hype here in Masada annoyed him. Heroic resistance, my foot. Really? You don’t believe our ancestors chose death over slavery? It’s probably just a fairy-tale. And Aaron was about to prove it. We found this lamp in Aaron’s car. Looks old. Roman? Judean. Someone in the camp saw a car drive away. That’s right. There was a car. It was Philippe. -Hello. -Hello, Mr. Morsadegh. Is everything all right? Yes, yes. He’s forgotten something, as usual. Yes, yes. As usual. -Fine. -That’s why he’s got me. Bye. CERTIFICATE OF IAA AUTHENTICATION Philippe. We’ve heard Aaron is dead. Where are our goods? You have until tomorrow. Or you’re a dead man. Aazar. Aazar. We know who owns the car. Aaron’s assistant, Philippe Morsadegh. What’s his name again? It’s an Iranian name, but Philippe is Jewish. Iranian origins but he grew up in France. He moved here because of anti-Semitic hostility. A loner, but has a clean record. Has the search begun? Hanan is questioning the other students but I doubt it’ll help much. See you later. Geek. So I heard. The boss. Granddad! My deepest sympathy, Mr. Salzman. Commissioner Godin. If it was a crime, we’ll get the murderer. He will not escape justice. I have to ask you to follow our security measures. Salzman’s father and brother died in the Warsaw ghetto. From a Nazi hand grenade attack. And he’s the victim of an explosion again. Awful to go through that with your own son. The one you danced with? The reason you came to the Dead Sea. Hanan should mind her own business. Hello, David. Hello, darling. Guess where I am. Masada? I haven’t been there since my school days. I know. Your parents called. They can’t make the concert. -Why not? -Leo’s passport expired. He only realized at the airport. What now? They’ll fly the day after tomorrow. The scatterbrain. Not my fault. Do you know I love you? Yes. Yes, I want to. Kisses. See you later. Very funny. Mind your own business, Blok. It looks as though a casualty or a victim is being rescued. We’ve heard from the police that it could be Aaron Salzman. The son of Avram Salzman, the famous archaeologist. -That’s all we know for now. -Michal. Police and the rescue services are at the scene. Michal, please. Don’t. It will all be all right. It will be all right. Trust me, okay? The police are silent while investigations are on-going. Already in the city? Yes. We’ve located Morsadegh’s mobile, near his home. Special forces are on their way. But please be careful. If he’s a terrorist… What are you doing? We have to lie low for a few days. Aaron messed up. That’s not true. You have to come with me. We have to lie low until I’ve sorted things out. -Michal. -No. No. Great, don’t then. But don’t open the door. Do you hear? To anyone. Secure the evidence. Clear. One woman. Hello. Police. Could you stop that please? Where is Philippe Morsadegh? I-- I don’t know. You’re lying. He was here just now. The hood of his car is still warm. What do you want from me? And why are you shouting at me? What are you staring at? Get out. He may have been sighted outside. When’s the baby due? In three months. Is Philippe Morsadegh the father? No. Aaron Salzman is the child’s father? Yes. Yes. How long have you lived here? Four months. And why not with the father of your child? Aaron needed peace and quiet to write his post-doc. After that we wanted to marry and move in together. She’s an archaeology student at Tel Aviv university. She has a Schottenstein foundation scholarship. Aaron’s brother says it was Palestinian fanatics who oppose the excavation. We don’t know if it was a terror attack. Yes we do. This is the detonator which triggered the explosion prematurely. Someone tampered with it. I had it explained-- Morsadegh’s no explosives expert. He’s a research assistant. But he searched Aaron’s apartment after the explosion. The concierge called us. And his motive? Why would he carry out an attack? He isn’t Palestinian, he’s Jewish. Maybe just in name. We found a well-worn copy of the Koran at his. With lots of underlinings. That doesn’t make him a terrorist. I have one too. But given he’d recently learned how to handle explosives… I spoke to his trainer. Morsadegh’s been taking an explosives course for several weeks. So he’s part of a sleeper cell? -Iranian. He’s Iranian. -I know. He uses Farsi on his phone, not Arabic. Who cares which lingo they hate us in? Spare me that. What’s the plan? To visit the Salzmans tomorrow. Why? One of them can’t remember anything and the other saw nothing. Salzman may be hiding something. What do you mean by that? Nothing. I’m just doing my job. Now, listen carefully. The Salzmans are the victims of an attack. Possibly, but they’re our only witnesses. -Coming, Hanan? -Okay. No. Blok will go with you. Okay. Watch she doesn’t use the wrong tone. And you two find Morsadegh, pronto. Don’t take it amiss, he’s rarely so sentimental but his family were killed in the Holocaust and Avram Salzman is his hero. Aaron! It’s over, Elia. He’s dead. No, it’ll never be over. I’ll be at the synagogue. Dad. Shalom. -What happened? -They didn’t make it. What now? Leo is such a scatterbrain. Saul. Thank you. My pleasure. Shame about your parents. They’ll be here the day after tomorrow. Excellent. How’s Meira? Wonderful. The grandchildren keep her on her toes. It does her good. But her kibbutz time is over. Your sister says she can’t wait to get home. -Am I your only guest? -You’re more than enough. Yes. Lehayim. This is mine but you can have it. Thanks, Sadin. Here you are. That’s for you. Here’s a new SIM card. Give this to Aazar. See you. My talks at the university with Salzman senior were always enriching. He was unresponsive today. No wonder. His son is dead. No, I don’t mean that. Sara, what do you know about the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto? Well, it took place in 1943-- On the eve of Passover. Warsaw was to finally be rid of Jews. But it didn’t go to plan this time. -The Jewish people fought back. -Avram’s father and brother died. But Avram survived. Then he came to Israel. He was one of many. They had nothing but their life and their shame for having survived and having been subjected to this. Then he discovered Masada. The history of his people who chose death over slavery. A wonderful man. Checkmate. Put it back, Ori. Everyone gets the same. I’d like to say a few words in memory of Uncle Aaron. Heed these three things and you’ll never go wrong. Remember where you come from, where you’re going and to whom you’re accountable. -Well? -Amen. Spare us your hypocrisy about Aaron. We know you hate him. Good morning. Can we talk, Mr. Salzman? Keep away from the boiling water! Keep the children away from the stove! -He didn’t do anything. -He could scald himself! Just be more careful. With pleasure. Why were you in Masada? Do you remember? -I was meeting Aaron. -So you remember that. Sadly not. Elia told me. What’s the last thing you remember? Do you think I’m just acting? No, of course she doesn’t. I don’t remember anything after Elia dropped me off, up until when he came back. Did Aaron have enemies at the university? Do you think our colleagues blew him up? That’s absurd. Masada is a Zionist symbol. It was your excavations that made it into that. Have you received any threats recently? I used to get some. But not now I’m old, almost dead. Your son opposed your excavations? My son sometimes talked nonsense. Apart from that, he was a talented young man. A genius of a teacher. A joy to me. But now… he’s dead. I’m going to the office now. Please be gentle with my father. Please just go, Elia. I can manage fine without you. Do you know Philippe Morsadegh? Your son’s assistant. We’ve got a search out for him. If he shows up, let us know. Why would he? You looked at me like that yesterday. Why is that? I thought we knew each other from the past. But that’s-- That obviously can’t be the case. Strange guy. But that was unnecessary. What? Embarrassing him. I didn’t mean to. Wait. All okay? It’s all a bit too much, right? How long have you been living with your father-in-law? Since we got married. We didn’t want Avram to be on his own. Since his mother died, Elia feels responsible for Avram. When was that? Elia was still a child. He was 12. How did she die? It was a domestic accident. And as you and Elia took care of him, Aaron didn’t need to lift a finger? Aaron. He took off when he was 18. We’re happy to do it. We manage very well. Avram can’t remember anything. Do you believe him? What do you want me to say? What you think. He would never lie. Are you sure? Really. Thanks. Pathology. Aaron was struck before the explosion. So it wasn’t a terrorist attack. No, it was personal. The item is no longer available, but we’ve found a valuable piece. It costs 100,000. If anything happens to me, these photos go to the police. This damn scumbag is threatening us. They’ve been there all day. Is it to do with the attack? Sorry, you’ll have to wait. It wasn’t a terror attack. No one has claimed responsibility. It was personal, not political. A family secret, huh? Elia kills his brother, the father covers it up. Got any better ideas you could share? Jealousy. Aaron was popular with his students. Some were in love with him. It seems he took advantage of that. The key question is, what was Philippe looking for at Aaron’s? If a university salary pays for a swish pad by the sea, I resign. Exactly. Aaron’s wealth is suspicious. Swish apartment, swish car-- We checked his bank balance. He had debts, huge debts. His father helped him out several times. And then suddenly, ten months ago… -Into the black with a cash deposit. -And money’s been flowing. And the lamp in Aaron’s car may be valuable. Maybe that’s why Philippe broke in. Careful. This is Aaron Salzman we’re talking about. Philippe is in charge of the archive at the Institute. So he has access to the valuable antiquities. I checked the database for possible interested parties. Aazar Haddad did time in prison for that. The database really only came up with one name? No, but only one Iranian name. That points to Philippe for me. We’ll be right with you. I’ll be right back. Leslie says you were at the excavation site prior to Aaron’s death. Why didn’t you tell us? You saw Leslie and Aaron? Yes. Michal, did Aaron do some crooked business? Did he sell antiques illegally? Michal. Is that why you fought? Was Philippe involved too? No, he had nothing to do with it. It was these criminals. Aazar Haddad? No idea. I don’t know these guys. -I know-- -Philippe spoke Farsi to them. Michal, we can take you to the station for questioning. Your choice. I kept asking who he was on the phone with. I’d seen a Judean vase at Aaron’s. When I asked what it was doing there, he got really nervous. Then Philippe confessed to me that it was their side-job, and that other Iranians smuggle things out of the country. They murdered Aaron. You have to get these guys. Where were you the morning Aaron died? Here. Can anyone confirm that? What do we do with Michal? She could lead us to Philippe. I’d like her to stay at large for now. Fine by me. Just make sure Hanan keeps an eye on her. It’s Godin. Yes. Understood. See you shortly. We have to go. They’ve found something in Aaron’s apartment. Blank forms from Elia’s office. Export certification. That figures. Our Romeo was flogging our culture. Or rather our ex-Romeo. You again? When will you finally release my brother’s body? We have unpleasant news. A call for you. Thank you. Hello? Have the police been there? Yes. Did you say anything? No. Nothing that could harm you. Go to the archive and get me an oil lamp. Can’t you? Believe me, if I could, I would. I can’t, Philippe. You have to! Do it for your child. Please. You knew nothing of your brother’s dealings? How would I? I hardly had any contact with him. But you wouldn’t put it past him. These are stamped by your office. They were in Aaron’s apartment. Who did he get them from? Did you authenticate them? Yes or no? Do sit down. Didn’t you ever wonder how he got by? Financially. The apartment, the car. I didn’t give my brother much thought. -God is punishing me for that-- -Leave God out of this. We’ll punish you if we find irregularities in your account. You’re welcome to check everything. Here. Hanan? She’s just left her place but I don’t know where she’s going yet. Good. Stick with her, but don’t go it alone. Michal. Is your father home? -Do something. -Mr. Salzman. Send her away. Mr. Salzman, Aaron needed IAA authentication for his fraud. Mr. Salzman. He’d never do such a thing. Did your sons fight? Elia is religious and Aaron was-- A hedonist. That’s what you mean. Yes. Aaron is someone who loves life. Oh, dear. Yes. May I? Who do I remind you of? Someone who looked like you. She was pretty tenacious in her work too. An outstanding journalist. Her name was Miriam. She did a piece on our work. Her husband was a famous physicist. -Yehuda… -Cohen. Yehuda Cohen. That’s right. We became good friends. My aunt. She died a long time ago. In an accident, when I was little. It’s old. First century, but worthless. There are dozens of them. To carry out a fraud, you need people stupid enough to be duped. You’re not one of them. You mean because I know it’s an ostracon? Correct. That is really one of the fragments of clay used to draw lots in Masada. What’s written on it? Eleazar Ben Yair. It was he who convinced his fellow campaigners that it was better to die as freemen than to be taken prisoner by the Romans. Good-bye. May I? For the nursery? You wanted to take over Aaron’s business, huh? To finally make some money. No. Michal… you helped a murder suspect escape. Maybe you were involved in the murder yourself? Philippe had to deliver the goods, otherwise they’d kill him too. Where’s the handover? I don’t know. I have nothing more to do with it. I swear. Prove it. Call him and ask where the handover is. Waste of time. The guy has removed the batteries. Shit. That’s it then for the moment. Text him. He’ll read it sooner or later, call you and you pick up. Got that? I have to go. David’s playing this evening. Philippe just called her. The handover will take place in the Carmel Market parking lot. But I-- Well done. Now go on home. Very pretty. Suspect is approaching. Stop. That’s not Philippe. Attention. The man with the case isn’t Philippe. Do not take action. I repeat, do not take action. But stay in place. And now? Go after him? You’ve wired the suitcase. Let’s see it. You can keep that. I want my money, Aazar. -Shit! -Freeze! -Hands above your heads! -Drop your guns! Get down on the floor! Don’t move! Drop it! Next week if you like. Ah, the drinks. Wonderful. Thank you. -That was fast! -Here you go. -I’m sorry. Forgive me. -No worries. First my parents and now me. It’s fine, darling. Wilson says they want me to tour the US. -Really? -Yes. That’s fantastic! Even if I’m away for three months? -Yes. -Then let’s celebrate. May I introduce my wife Sara. -Hello, Sara. -Hey, Wilson. Sit yourself down. You made it. -Are you well? -Great. You missed a treat. Every stone here breathes history. This is of great importance politically. Thank you. Look. She looks just like you. My Aunt Miriam. I thought you had no relatives here. She died when I was three. I’m sure I’ve told you about her. I’m sorry, I don’t remember. Good morning. I’ll be right with you. Morning. Sara. Listen, about yesterday, Blok said you-- Sorry, but I’m not getting involved. -Coffee? -Yes please. Blok was right. It was stupid to arrest her. Michal should have led us to Philippe. You messed up. I don’t care what you find. Go and get-- It can’t have been the smugglers. Why not? Those guys all have an alibi. They were meeting at the harbor. I was there and checked on it. Go and sort it out! Now! -And close the door, please. -Yes. Elia complained to the boss because the body hasn’t been released. That Holy Joe. Michal. -No-- Wait. -Leave me alone. See what happened? Just because I did you a favor. You’re dragging me into this shit, just like Aaron. -I never want to see you again! -Let me go! You assholes, I want to talk to her! Can’t you let me go for five seconds? -Get him out of here. -I won’t be treated like a filthy Arab! Leave me alone! Let me go! Avram? Won’t you come and have breakfast? Should I perhaps call a doctor? What for? So that I know how my son died? It’s not looking good for you. You’re keeping quiet about an illegal trade in antiquities. You were there a day before the attack and have no alibi. But you have a motive. Your child’s father was having fun with another woman. You went home and began planning your wedding. You’re religious, aren’t you? You were praying when we found you. And you were just praying now. Your parents are very devout. That means you have to marry. They would never accept an illegitimate child. Aaron wasn’t religious. He didn’t want an orthodox wedding. He didn’t want to get married at all. You’d have been alone with your child. That’s why I went to his family. The evening before he died. What? You went to see the Salzmans? Why didn’t you say so earlier? I did it for Gilli. But the old man just sent me away. Did you tell Philippe? Did you tell Philippe? Yes. Criminals posing as carriers have smuggled countless antiquities. The main suspect Philippe Morsadegh has been arrested and is now in custody. The police assume that Aaron Salzman, the archaeologist murdered last Sunday, was also involved in the illegal trade. His brother, Elia Salzman, is head of the IAA authentication department. He didn’t see that he was betraying his country and his family. Oh, but he did. He just didn’t care. Aaron was selfish, greedy and narcissistic. This is Elia Salzman. I’m willing to make a statement about my brother and the antiques scandal. A 100,000 shekel lamp. And Aaron Salzman’s expertise: a false report in which he states this lamp is from the oldest synagogue in Magdala. That’s true. What is? It’s true that Aaron wrote false expertises. And you knew Aazar’s people. You arranged it. Did he bribe Elia for the authentication certificates or did you blackmail him? Aaron stole them from him. Elia didn’t notice a thing. Whenever Aaron had an appointment at the IAA, he made sure he was alone in the office for a few minutes and stole blank certificates. We spoke to Leslie. She described you as the guy in the archive. Nice but not a hit with women. That asshole was the winner. He took everything. The money, the women… That made you mad so you set off the explosion and hoped it would look like an accident. No, I-- When the charge went off, I’d only just got to Masada. I panicked and I was desperate. Aaron wanted to pull out… and Aazar was furious. You’re so up to your neck in shit. Go to your cell. You’ll have plenty of time to think about it all. Take him away. Sara. Okay, guys, why don’t we have a confession yet? Well, he’s a bit of a wimp, but he’s also a tough cookie. And very unhappily in love. Why do you say that? Just a hunch. Didn’t you see how he looked at her? Guys… Salzman’s on TV. There. I’ve asked you here because I want to make something clear to the media. Once and for all, neither I nor anyone at the IAA issued authentications for my brother. I have nothing to do with Aaron Salzman’s illegal activities. Thank you. Pity we can’t hear what our Holy Joe is saying there. “I thought it would all be behind me now that Aaron is dead.” That’s what he just said to Deborah. I’ve been doing a lip-reading course for a while. It’s part of my continuing education. But I’m just a beginner. “I thought it would all be behind me now that Aaron is dead.” What would be behind you? You were one of the first on the scene. It has to do with your mother’s death, right? That’s what should come to an end. Yes, that’s true. No interviews. Leave us in peace. Aaron tormented Elia. He blamed him for her death. Elia. It’s been hell every day since we’ve lived here. That’s all ancient history. It’s irrelevant. Ask him! Your son, Aaron, pulled the boiling water from the stove and it hit Esther. Now you know what happened. She was kneeling. She wanted to fix the dishwasher. She was severely burnt. Two months later she died. My God, I’ve heard the story so often, I could recite it backwards. Leave now. Ask Dr. Morsadegh why he killed Aaron. Let me put it this way: We’re doing our job. Is something up? Can you drop me here? -Thanks. Ciao. -Ciao. See you later. Thank you for your message. -Was she…? -No. Miriam and Yehuda’s daughter wasn’t in the accident. What’s her name? One, two three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Another drop, it’s hardly worth it. No, that’s enough. -Rafi! -Hello, Sara! -How are you? -Good. Keep quiet. Mom. Sorry I couldn’t make it earlier. Dad. You heard what happened? There are reformed parishes. If it’s so difficult, then forget it. It’s not so important these days. Of course getting married is just one possibility. -Lehayim. -Lehayim. Are you okay? Yes. Aren’t you sad that David will be in the US for so long? I don’t even want to think about it. I’ll be all on my own here. He doesn’t need to know that. No, that’s right. Sara, you’re the strongest person in the family. He doesn’t need to know that either. -Thank you for a lovely evening. -Our pleasure. Or that. It’s really late. Darling, we’re off or we won’t manage the sightseeing tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. -Yes. Can you manage? Okay, I’ll see you out. Thanks. -Good night. -Sweet dreams. See you tomorrow. Sara? What’s wrong, darling? I’m adopted, David. What? Leo isn’t my father, he’s my uncle. Leo’s sister Miriam, and her husband Yehuda were my natural parents. I was born here, David. Shit. How long have you known? I found out today. Where did you get that from? The rabbi sent it to me just now. My God. Avram was friendly with her. He spoke about her. Do your parents know you know? No. Don’t you dare say a word. You have to talk about these things. There by the little tree. That must be the grave. “Yehuda Cohen, Miriam Cohen, née Stein.” You know what’s strange? I don’t feel anything. Blok. Lousy timing as usual. That’s my karma. That’s why I don’t feel guilty. What an idiot. “Dearest Michal, I can’t tell you how much I love you. I understand now that you will never share this love. I want you to know that I only ever thought of you, of you and Gilli. I wish you all the joy in the world. Take care. Unfortunately, for you I couldn’t be who I wanted to be.” Philippe didn’t hang himself because you were tough on him. No. Sara, Blok, in my office. Come in and sit down. What does that say about your work when the main suspect kills himself? What is this? A crazed, love-sick nerd who wouldn’t be helped? Should I have sent him to the psychiatrist? Maybe. Would that have changed anything? Probably not. What do you want from me? What do you want from Elia Salzman? He’s complained. Justifiably so. He has nothing to do with it. He’s clean and does a good job. He’s a murder suspect. Why? Philippe’s suicide is a confession. It simply proves how desperate he was. Philippe wrongly thought the blast was the cause of death. We don’t think the illegal trade and the murder are linked. Can you prove it? That’s why we grilled Elia. No alibi, but a motive. Just like Michal. No, how would that have worked? Michal goes into the tunnel, hits Aaron and Avram just stands there and then conveniently suffers from amnesia? Plus, she has no idea about explosives. It wasn’t Michal. We’ve all we need to charge the brother with murder. -What’s the motive? -The motive? Elia has always been in Aaron’s shadow. Being dragged into Aaron’s dealings was too much. -Excuse me. -No. Not now, Uri. Wait we’re talking. It’s nonsense. Elia didn’t know about Aaron’s activities. I’m warning you, I won’t have you-- Where’s she going? Sara… What’s going on? I’m sorry. I simply couldn’t bear seeing them like that. Not knowing. -You have to talk. -I warned you. -How could you, David? -Sara, darling. I know you think I’m a thief, feathering my own nest. But what right do you have? You, selling us all this crap! Leave it be and behave with some decency, you idiot! Yes, I know I’m an idiot. Come on. It’s all a sham. We’re surrounded by lies. But lie, Dad! -Go now! -Fool us all! No, I’ll show you something. Come on! We’re both going in there and I’ll prove I’m telling the truth. Dad! What are you doing? Easy. Come on, Dad. Easy. I’ll take you home. All right? Careful. Thank you. Mr. Salzman. I’d like to confess. I… killed my son. Where do I sign? Mr. Salzman, I-- Before we can accept your confession, we have some questions. How did Aaron die? From the explosion. But before that, I had struck him. It’s a false confession. It’s obvious. He’s protecting his son. How would he know that Aaron was hit? He saw how Elia killed him. Mr. Salzman, the Public Prosecutor has ruled you can go home on account of your age, your services and your past. But you will be under house arrest. One last trip to Masada wouldn’t be possible, I suppose? He wants to go to Masada. The Public Prosecutor doesn’t object. Do you know the legend? The Romans came upon the dead bodies of the besieged. Men, women, children… Dead but free. Better to die than live as slaves. We impress our current enemies with this spirit. Would you like me to tell you about Miriam? I don’t think we’re here to talk about my mother. When my family died back then in Germany I was called Paul Salzman. Since I’ve lived in Israel, I’ve been Avram Salzman. I don’t remember Paul. You too, have found yourself in this country. That’s your rock now. One mustn’t play with one’s identity. You have to hang onto it and defend it. I don’t believe that you killed your son. Thank you for accompanying me. We can go now. Avram has been to the police. He confessed. He confessed. That’s impossible. Don’t you get it? It’s because he thinks you did it. Well? Did you kill him? Or just get used to always being the guilty one? Do something for once! The Prosecutor wants to press charges tomorrow. I can’t stall him much longer. We still have nothing concrete on Holy Joe. Think of something. Bad cops lose a belief in justice. But you’re good cops. At least I hope you are. We need new material. Or we should review what we’ve got from a new angle. Thank you. She’s not coming. PIONEER BATTALION - EXPLOSIVES UNIT Your coffee. Great, thanks. Well? They’re back at the hotel. And very unhappy. Thanks. It goes without saying. A water. Still, please. And now? If I understand this correctly, Aaron wanted to prove that the historical facts don’t bear out the Masada legend. Due to a tunnel that hadn’t been discovered. One from the fortress to the foot of the mountain. An escape from the fortress? Thanks. Yes, that was Aaron’s hypothesis, and he wanted to prove his theory with the blast. That would have upset many people, especially his father. He was sure only a few of the zealots committed collective suicide. He depicts them as murderers of women and children. What I don’t understand is why Avram didn’t seem to care. Maybe he did care. Maybe he was just too shocked. Just a theory. I’ll know tomorrow if it’s true. My colleagues went home ages ago. Does that mean we can too? They’re flying home tomorrow. What do you want? We won’t answer any questions without our lawyer. No, no questions. I need some expert advice. Good morning. I think you wanted to speak to him yesterday. He says you called him six times. It’s your colleague from Masada in charge of securing the crime scene. What? There’s your coffee. You were an explosives expert during your military service, right? How we assess your father’s confession depends on whether he could work this mechanism. I can rule that out. You have to do the following. For safety’s sake. So nothing goes wrong. What are you driving at? Your father made a confession to protect someone. You. Mr. Salzman? You hated your brother. For his arrogance, his good looks, the fact that your father loved him. He went behind your back, stole from you, abused your trust. Yes, I did hate him! Not there. May God punish me, I hate you, Aaron. So what? Where’s Avram? -Avram? -Avram? Avram. One mustn’t play with identity. We need it to breathe. He didn’t understand that. Your son was wrong. The tunnel is a blind gallery. It goes a few meters into the rock, but not to the fortress. That’s not why I struck him. Mr. Salzman, please. Please, don’t. I drove out to Aaron… because I wanted to talk to him. I wanted to talk to him about the young woman’s allegations. She said he was illegally trading in antiques. I let myself be lured in. Come on. Although I should’ve known how I hate these tunnels ever since I-- In the ghetto… in… the sewage canal… I heard how the Nazis’ hand grenades mangled my father… and my brother. How I waited there until the Nazis had gone. Alone with rats and my fear. He confessed everything to me, all the fraud. Then he showed me the encircling wall of the Masada tunnel. His discovery. He mocked me. The narrowness of the tunnel… And suddenly I had a bar in my hand and I hit him over the head. But you have no experience with explosives. You don’t know how they work. Yes, I do. The young Paul knew back then in the sewage canal in the ghetto. The narrow space, the claustrophobic situation… We call that reenactment. He really believed he was the 10-year-old boy in Warsaw. That’s why I think he’ll soon be back home. He’ll be convicted for manslaughter and released on probation. Subjectively, he had no choice. So he’s not fully accountable. Thank you. -Have a nice day. -You too. He’s responsible nonetheless. No one can deny that. Especially not his family. Home time. In Masada, Avram said that he didn’t remember his mother. He looks at her photo but doesn’t recognize her. I’ll come visit you in the States. I thought you’d never ask. I must go to Berlin soon to see my parents. I have so many questions. -What’s that? -Open it. But I get to say when you come. Thank you.
