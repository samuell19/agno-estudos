Sunset in Kaitan today is at 4:02 pm. Will we see a starry sky tonight? We're in the dead of winter now. The crisp air in winter makes it the best season for seeing stars. With longer nights, there's more time for star gazing, too. Even if you're busy, take a moment and look up at the stars. Just be sure to stay warm, of course. Thanks for coming. Planetarium I'm home. You didn't cook? I emailed you. No time to do groceries? That's right. I've been busy. Let me through. So much makeup. Goes with the job. Hi. I'm just about to leave. Quit that stupid job already. How about "hello?" What? We can't take your call. Please leave your name and message after the beep. Wash your hand? Not telling. Seriously? No talking, got it? I said no talking. Be quiet now. Welcome to the world of stars. For thousands of years, these beautiful stars have been shining brilliantly. Of these countless stars, some are connected with lines to form constellations. You're not sleeping? Let's see... Where were you last night? The bar. Oh, no, wait... One of our girls... was completely sloshed. And so... I had to drive her home. And I ended up staying with her. You have work tomorrow. Get some sleep. Show me your phone. What? Let me see your phone. Fine, if you really want. But see it and we're finished. Whatever you're suspecting me of.. Always looking at fake stars. You're an idiot. Thank you for coming. That concludes our program today. We look forward to seeing you again. Thank you. You come here a lot. Thanks. You ever look up at the sky? The real one. Well, you should. Take this. Thank you, sir. Real one, huh? So, think you can be a starter? I dunno. Not yet, huh? I dunno. I see. What do you want? We used to go to the forest. To see the stars. Wanna go again? A grove, not a forest. No, I think I'll pass. I see. You're the one who said forest. Back then.. Say...

Tsutomu, be careful. Listen to your mommy, okay? Wow... Beautiful. So beautiful... Can't we do something? That pigsty. It stinks so bad it's bad for business. Do you have a moment? Huh? Sure. Every cafe needs clean water. We sell these now. Water filters. He's a water expert from the mainland. But we already have one. A lease, I see. The monthly filter replacement must be pricy. Not that bad. With this product here, the filter would last one year. Much more cost-effective. But it's so big. I have nowhere to put it. We could mount it on a wall and extend the hose. I don't know... With this one... Excuse me, if I may. You could even put it right there. But I already have one. You can pay in installments with your gas bill. Right, boss? Right. I don't know, I think it'll be in the way... This isn't working. What? You heard me. You promised more. Explain this to me, will you? It's not me the customers are buying from. Huh? Look, the customers are buying from you, the Meguro Company. You're a phone call away. The decades of trust you built as the local gas provider, that's the appeal. That's the tremendous advantage you have as a gas provider. But even after three visits... Then let's ask ourselves why people aren't buying. The Meguro Company is the one leading this sales campaign. Then what? It's our fault? No no, that's not what I mean. But there must be a reason, somewhere. Cut the bullshit. Following the end of the Kaitan Dock strike, the company announced a new voluntary retirement plan to help alleviate the downsizing. The union reportedly agreed to this. At the press conference held today, the company announced the plan will start with shipbuilding workers, and then expand to the repairs division. Ultimately, by next March... Good morning, Sir.

So that's what you want. What do you mean? I was wondering why you asked to meet. They're 40,000 yen per unit, but I'll give you a deal. Near wholesale price You see, the rep is in town now. I don't need profit. But wait a minute. What's the point? Why are you doing this? Right? Yeah. I'll consider it, so loosen up. You're so uptight, man. Meguro Company This is all your fault, you know. Don't give me that eye! I jammed the toilet. Seriously? Oh well. You girls are late! Sorry, bad traffic. Long time no see, Meguro! Let's change seats. Yeah. Can we all move over there? Certainly.

Idiot, it's pointless selling those things. No more, got it? Why is it pointless? Huh? How can you say that? Yoshie. Yes? Bring me some tap water. Water? - Forget it. - Do it! Just let me do my thing. Our business has always been selling gas. - We sell rice, too. - You listen to me! Try it. Quit smoking and try it. Filter replacements will give us steady income.

Wait, your kid's sleeping. Enough with that. Now he's your kid, too. You awake? Show me your face. No. C'mon. Show me your face. Ow. Heavy? A fight? With who? I see. Thought I wouldn't know? You dare do that again, I'll hurt you worse than this. Don't take it out on me! What? Whatever happened with Chieko, don't take it out on me. What? What's Chieko got to do with any of this?

Let's make today a good one. Yes, sir! Takasugi. What's the update on this unit? Oh, the Sasa apartment... It's impossible. The guy just won't pay. I can hear his TV, but he won't come to the door.
