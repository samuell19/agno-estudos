(laughing) (tires screeching) (horn honking) - We gave you a headstart, Joe. (country music) - See here it says you've been unemployed for a year. Must've driven you crazy, you ever worked as a stacker before? - No. - Here in the crappiest kingdom on them all, Westbarn, we see the bounty of the earth placed in readiness. Grill made fine foods in there. Bacon, ham, smoked goods, eggs and dairy products. Along here you see we've got the boxed dinner and frozen desserts. (upbeat music) Used to get shop price on any of the goods. The retailer can legally purchase at that price. Ya understand, you see in busload (indistinct) Here, help yourself, enjoy that? - Good, now don't let me see you helping yourself to anything else around here, otherwise you're going to get hit in the head by a bolt of lightning. - [Intercom] Where are you?

Don't screw up, speak to her. - Hi. You don't remember me, do you? Your mom got me to cut the apricot trees out the front of your place just before Easter. Telecoms said it was a touching the wires. She brought me out some lemonade, you were inside. I could see ya through the window. You were in bed sick or you'd had an accident or something and when I asked to get paid in cash, she didn't have any but you did. - Oh, yeah. - I'm sorry I had to do that but it's just, I didn't want to have to declare it to social security or anything, you know? You think your mom will need me again? - Well, she's in Bali right now but I'll ask her when she gets back. - Yeah. - Look. - Thanks. - Did you bring your car? I can go home, get mine and give you lift. - My boyfriend's picking me up. Here he is. (door creaks open) - Fucking tea room.

(laughing) - The New Abridged Witches Companion, Rena Temple Publishing House indicates that a successful love spell may only be concluded with objects from close to or representing the beloved body of the person we most passionately desire. - So... - Yeah? - So do you want to see me some time? - I'd love to. - Maybe Thursday, Friday? I could finish early. - Uh, look I gotta get out of here, Ill see you, Chase! - Yeah, fuck you too. - Hello, my dear. (slow rock music) - Hi, hey we've met, haven't we? In the tea room and then in the laundromat, right? And you know, Roslyn, right? Well, look, I hope you can keep your mouth shut about what you saw the other night. Things happen, you know, I mean, I love Roz but... You know, things happen, you know? You know what I mean? Well anyway chief, anything you need to know around here, you let me know, all right? Anything. Ah, I see we have a new car in the yard. That your car, you're a Chrysler man too, me too. That's a very interesting looking vehicle you got there. What you got under the bonnet? Do you mind if I take a look? - Yeah. - I see you have some personal refinements. All of which you are illegal. You know, I've never seen a home-made air roam before. I can get you a factory one, if you like. I can do it at my old man's shop right now, no problem. I'll do it at cost. Well you don't have to pay me now. You can just pay me when you got the money. You see that? If anything goes missing I'll know where to find it. I'm only joking. (slow rock music) Come on. Joe, this is my father and my brother, Tommy and this is a friend of ours, Ted. - Hi Daze, hi Joe, what do ya know? - Hold it up, Tommy. - What are you doing? - Christ son, what does it look like? All right, pump it again, Tom. - My brother is a NASCAR driver and here my father raids the (indistinct) for Thunderdome and they rebuilt the motor last month. So Tommy's got no excuses now. Well, at least I haven't totaled anything, have I? - All right, let's call it a day. Are you hanging around for a while, pretty boy? Lock up. - Get out of my room. - Look. - Go forth and multiply. - Here, it's liver. - I'm tired. Just go. - Good for you. It's got iron in it, you shouldn't be working. You know that, Savina. - Mom. I'm going to move out soon. - Oh, when? - Soon as I can. - I don't think we're ready for that yet, Savina. - Mom. Mom listen, mom, mom listen, I'm ready, mom, you... What are you doing here, get out! - I just want a drink. - Fuck off. - I know it's fashionable for young people to have a filthy mouth, Savina. - Get out of my room, get out, get out. - I draw the line... - Get out, get out, get out. get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out! Perfect bitch. (laughs) May the power of Satan enter this, my magic circle. (mystical music) (speaks foreign language) - Do you think my car's good? - I think it's better than it looks. - Good enough... Good enough for Cherry Lane? - Oh, well no one races at Cherry Lane, not since I left Melbourne. Things have changed, police got to know it too well. - Where, then? - You might try the rail yards any Friday night. (tires screeching) - I heard this rumor there was an embarrassing moment in the tea room the other night. - [Joe] Think! (groans) - Get off him, you fuckin'... (screams) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, just, just... (groaning) - What, are ya fuckin' him as well? - Yeah. (car revving) - Shit, $150 pants. (car revving) - You're good with girls, they like you, don't they? - Well, the one that I want the most is the one that wants me least right now. You know about that smash we were in up in Brisbane, don't ya? Got a chance to race HQ's on the weekend. Anyway, I went to pick up Roz after work and I've never had a smash outside of the track but I was doing this U-turn and she was, she was nagging me about driving too quick. So I got angry and I planted my foot, collected this car and ruptured my gas tank and the car caught fire. (slow, sad music) We got out but her clothes were burning... Burning into her so I, you know, I rolled her on the ground and I had to wait for an ambulance and I didn't even get a scratch and she was screaming, screaming and not even like a person, like nothing, nothing, nothing I've ever heard before. There's no pain like the pain from a burn. (crying) (rain falling) (door knock) - Who is it? - It's Joe, from the laundromat. - What do you want? - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. - Look, it's really late, you know? - Yeah, I would've phoned first but I lost your number. I wrapped it up good and tight so it wouldn't get wet. You left it at the laundromat. - That's really good of you, Joe. Thank you. - It was something I thought you'd care about, I knew you'd just hate to lose it. - Listen, I'd ask you in but I was just going to bed. - Nah, I don't want to be any bother. Listen, I'm sorry about everything down at the laundromat. You and me and my dad and everything, you know. I'm sorry to disturb you. - It's all right. Stop apologizing. - I'm sorry. I mean, good night. - Good night. (blues music) (singing in foreign language) (gunshots) - Pop, pop! - Do you want the cops down here again? - Pistol, you give me the gun. - Stay out of my room! - Give me! - Do you hear me, stay out of my room! - Give me the gun, give me the gun, give me the gun! (cat meows) - Look what I found, Savina. - Took you long enough. - Playing witches again, are we? - Mom, she's giving me the evil eye. - You're sick in your head, you know that, who is this supposed to be? - I'm sick in the head? - Who is it, Savina? - Come on mum, you know who it is. - Who is it? - Cute doll, mum. - Who, Savina? - (speaking foreign language) - I prayed for you when you were sick in your body, Savina. I'll pray for you now that you're sick in your heart. Holy Mary mother of God, pray for us sinners now and (speaking over one another) (buzzing) (muttering angrily) (crying) (dramatic music) - I think there's a girl at work who likes me. The one, the one with the dark eyes. Are you all right? - Yes. - Savina. - No, what does it look like? - I'm sorry, I just, I thought I could help. (laughs) Who hit you? If it was a guy I could hit him back for you. I look skinny but I fight hard. - Then go and beat up my mother, the mad bitch. - Well come to think of it, she's the perfect girl for you. - Wish I was handsome. - Look, looks, they're not important, it's how you feel about yourself. If you feel good about yourself, then they think they should feel good about you too. - Is that what you do? - How'd you like it here so far? I hate it, too. - I got, I got nowhere to take her. - I'm Joe. - Savina - Except maybe the rail yards this Friday. - You want to take her there? - I saw Robert Day talking to you the other night. - Oh Dazey. - Is he a friend of yours? - Yeah, we know each other. - All girls like cars that go fast. - We go under the the rail yards to watch the drags. - All you gotta do is go fast, Joe but there's some pretty sick cars out there. - Some pretty sick cars get down there. - Sick? - What's wrong with them? - Sick means good. - Yeah, sick. You know, it means good. - Where have you been, man? - Anyway, you wanna come with us? Because I'll look after you. Can I come with you? - Yeah, why not? (cheering) (cars revving) - I think this is it, don't you? (cars revving) (tires screeching) This railway side is a quarter of a mile long. Petrol heads painted in a line up there. That's the end. (cars revving) - Thanks, we have that brand at work, don't we? - We have every brand of everything at work. Including cat food. (cars revving) - I'm not paying that man, I'm not paying. Last week, you fuckin' knocked me up, you knocked me up for three, man, what's happening? What's happened in a week, yeah?

I'm going to pay it three and that's it. Last week it was three, I'm not doin' it, man. No way, no way, no I'm not asking for tic. No, I'm not asking for tic, I'm talking cash. Cash, money talks bullshit. Oh come here, blimey, a confirmed sighting. - Hi Rosco. - Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! How long you been back? - Oh, I don't know, a couple months. - Yeah?
