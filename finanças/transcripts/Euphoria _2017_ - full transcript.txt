[indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter continues] [child crying] [indistinct PA announcements] [aircraft engines rumbling] It's so good to see you. I... I was afraid you'd cancel. Hello. We have a reservation for a double room. - [receptionist] Your name? - Emilie Thomson. Ines Thomson. So, let me know if there's anything you need. Thank you. - What a place. - I wanted to treat us. [Ines chuckles] - It's huge! - [chuckling] Yeah. [Ines] So nice to get out of New York. I... I read some reviews this morning about your new exhibition. That's fine. I thought they were mean. I'm sure you worked very hard. They used to love you. That's how it goes. If people don't like my work, then at least I make them feel something. [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] [Ines clears her throat] It's very fancy. [chuckles] I got more than I was expecting for my flat. - You've sold your apartment? - Yeah. I moved out last week. If... If I'm gonna go back to my studies, a student room will be just fine. [waiter] Ladies, may I take your order? Um... I'll have the lobster and champagne. [waiter] Sure. [sighs] - The same. - [waiter] Excellent. I found this. Look. - What's this? - Mum's ring. I found it when I went through my stuff. I thought you might want it. No, you keep it. [piano playing] [Emilie] Cheers. I'm so glad you came. Grateful that you took the time. Of course. [piano playing continues] [sniffs] [man] Excuse me. - Yes? - [Ines] Please. Would one of you beautiful ladies care to dance? - Yeah. - [Ines] No. [Emilie] Why not? [gulping] [Ines] Emilie... So, tell me about yourself, Emilie. What is there to say? I'm nobody. Alone, unimportant, full of unfulfilled dreams. [Emilie chuckling] Actually, I'm here on a holiday with my sister. Now that her career's not going so well, she finally agrees to see me. [Emilie] I don't have time to lie. [man] And why is that? Just dance with me, please. [piano stops playing] [whispering] You've got sensitive hands. I'd love to go to bed with you, but... [chuckles] I don't think that's possible, I'm afraid. Goodnight. [retching] [coughing] - [crockery clattering] - [Ines] Emilie? What happened to you? Is everything fine? [Ines] What's happening? - What's... - Get... Get the fuck off! I probably shouldn't have drunk champagne. There's just been a lot going on in my head. I just need to relax. This place we're going to will be so nice. So calm. So peaceful. It'll be perfect. Just perfect. Look. [gasps] That's so gorgeous. - [Emilie] Stop that. No. - [Ines] No. - Emilie, tell me... - Come on, Ines, it's... It's... [Ines] Tell me where we're going. We're going to the most beautiful place in the world. [Ines laughs] Yeah, you already said that. Come on. It's... It's very special. The question is, can I have a massage there? Of course, madam. As many as you wish. - [Ines] Oh, good! - [chuckling] Then I'm happy. [phone ringing] [phone clicks] Hello? - [woman] Hi. - Hi. [laughs] - Hello. Can you hear me? - [woman] Who is this? Well, I, um... I saw the... The press photo you're using and... [woman] The one that you agreed on? Well, I want you to use the other one. [woman] Which one? The one where I'm not smiling. Hello? [tuts] [phone beeps] We're leaving the country. I thought I told you. Don't worry, it's not far now. [man] This is it. Shouldn't they have a signpost or something? They probably want to keep it as anonymous as possible. [laughs] Well, they've definitely succeeded with that. [car door opens] - You must be Emilie? - Yes. And you must be her sister? And you are? I'm Marina. I am Emilie's personal companion. I'm so glad you made it. Most of our guests prefer the helicopter option. It's a bit of a walk, but if you get tired, we'll help you. Are we going through here? It's not so far, you'll manage. [footsteps crunching] - [insects buzzing] - [birds chirping] Here we are. [quiet chatter] Is it like you imagined? [Emilie] Even better. [Marina] This is where most of the guests love to come on their own, or their partners or friends to sit, play chess, be quiet. That's why I love this house. You have to sign in first. Reception is through there. Let me know if there's anything you need. [Aron] Hello? Hi, welcome. Please, come in. - Hi. - [Ines] Hi. [Aron] Aron. And you must be Emilie? - Yeah. - [Aron] Please, sit down. [Aron sighs] So, first things first. Passports, please. Thank you. - Here you go. - [Aron] Thanks. We have a medical certificate, lawyer's documents and proof of payment. So everything seems to be in order. Thank you. I'm sure you know how everything works here, but I'm legally required to run it all through with you in person before we can continue. Unlike other organizations, we offer our guests a service created for, and by, the individual. Freedom of choice is our utmost concern and serving that choice is our aim. There are a selection of activities you can choose from. You'll find a schedule by the front entrance. We try to accommodate our guests' unique desires and wishes in order to make their final days as fulfilling and comforting as possible. Emilie, should you choose to continue, your leaving will take place in six days from now. Each leaving is preceded by a bell. The individual is taken to the leaving cabin and is offered a drink containing a strong sedative - that will put them to sleep. - [Ines] What do you mean? [Aron] The choice to drink is left entirely to the individual. A week later, the body will be transported to the address you have provided. Photographs are not permitted. Do you have any questions? Where are my bags? [stammering] I don't know. Well, can you go and get somebody to get my bags. Try to calm down. I'm not well. [man] Your bags are already in your room. - I will take you there. - What are you doing? - It's okay. - What the... Don't you fucking touch me! You do not have to do anything. You just have to stay with me. What do you mean you're not well? What are you talking about? I'm gonna have a shower. We can talk when you've calmed down. I'm not going to calm down! I want you to tell me - what is going on! - I just want a shower! [Emilie] I was diagnosed three years ago. I had chemo, but it didn't work. It's everywhere. I don't have long left. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to scare you. I didn't want to give you a reason... not to come. I had the right to know. Really? I don't think so. I tried. I tried to call. But you didn't pick up. I waited, but you never called back. A while later you emailed saying you were busy. And then... I don't know. Time went by and... I lost the words. And this place? This is how I want to leave. [animals calling] [rustling] [insects chirping] - [animals croaking] - [insects humming] - [shower running] - [thud] [Ines] Emilie? [waters turns off] [breathing deeply] Sugar Puffs? Yeah. We always had them when we were little. Don't you remember? No. Mum's blueberry pancakes. I sent them the recipe. Perfect. I'm sorry if you feel like I don't respect you, but I really think that we should get out of here. You need proper care. If you leave... I'll still do it. Have some pancakes. They're good. - [birds singing] - [indistinct chatter] [Ines] Jesus. [indistinct singing] - [Marina] Good morning. - Morning. - Did you sleep well? - [Emilie] Yes. And breakfast was wonderful. Everything just as I wanted. I'm glad to hear that! And, Ines, how are you today? Fine. - Well, I thought that... - Excuse me, um... What are you doing with these people? - We're helping them. - [Ines] Really? We can't save their lives, but these last days are important. So people can leave in the right way for them. This is a free zone. Without the world to judge. So, Emilie, what would you like to do today? I was hoping the three of us could sit and talk. - [Marina] Of course. - About... - Follow me. - Emilie... - [crockery clinking] - [insects buzzing] [switch flicks] ["Suite for Cello Solo No.2" by Bach playing] [Marina] No music, thank you. - [switch flicks] - [music stops] So... Emilie? There's some things I wanted to talk about so... I wrote them down. [sniffs] I've never been able to control my feelings. Everything has always flooded straight into me. My sister... on the other hand, has always been very clear. She can turn her emotions on and off, feeling exactly what she wants to feel, when she wants to feel it. It all began when Dad left with another woman. I was nine, my sister was seven. Mum never got over it. I stayed by her side. I tried to stop her from slipping through the gaps. But there was no way. Five years ago, she hung herself in the woods. Just stop it. What are you doing? What could she possibly say about that? You told me yesterday that you were dying, and now you want me to sit here, in this place, in front of this woman and talk about our childhood. Is that what you want? You never wanted to talk about it. I don't need to listen to this. Goddamn this. [birds singing] [bell tolls] [bell tolls] [bell continues tolling] [camera shutter clicks] [man] Those charming bells of death. [tolling continues] I don't think that's allowed. It's personal, for inspiration. [he chuckles] So, you're above the rules, are you? Art's above the rules. I don't dislike rules. It's just that I have never found any sufficiently worthwhile to follow. I understand everything. [Ines] Hmm. But I have yet to find the meaning in anything. [he inhales and exhales deeply] Can I take a photo of you? Yes, all right. [he clears his throat] [camera shutter clicks] I have a stage three terminal brain tumor. What about you? You don't look sick. - I'm here with my sister. - Oh. Is she artistic too? No. It's just me. It keeps me together. I don't understand this place. People seem to think that there's some kind of meaning. Something they should be able to understand before they die. There's nothing to understand. You just die. They refuse to accept that their lives are completely meaningless. Especially women. [chair creaking] I mean, why would a life suddenly become important only because you are about to die? People come here and give up. It's pathetic. [man] So, what's the alternative? Carry on with futile hospital treatment? More suffering for even higher bills? I don't think so. Thankfully... places like this allow those of us who can afford it to pay for a comfortable death. In the end, we're all pathetic. That's quite artistic, don't you think? Hmm? - [insect buzzing] - [birds calling] [woman in distance] "Both its end and its beginning, sense that here and now is both your departure and return. Sense how death and life are as strong as wine inside you! Yes. To be one with the night... one with myself... with the candles flame which looks me in the eyes still, unfathomable and still. One with the aspen that trembles and whispers. One with the crowds of flowers leaning out of darkness to listen to something I had on my tongue to say... but never got said. Something I don't want to reveal, even if I could. - And it murmurs..." - I'm sorry. [woman] "...of purest happiness. And the flame rises. It is as though the flowers crowded nearer, nearer... and nearer the light... in a rainbow of shimmering points. Aspen trembles... - and plays..." - I'll try my best. "...and all that was inexpressible and distant... is inexpressible and near. I sing of the only thing that reconciles... only of what is practical, for all alike." [Emilie] I'm trying to think about the things that have been beautiful in my life. Like what? Just... small... everyday things, really. Sunrises. When it's cold in winter and you come into the warm. Soft things. I've never had particularly great sex. - [Ines] No? - No. Maybe I was just scared. I think I've spent my entire life being scared. Of what? Come on. Tell me about the best sex you've ever had. [laughing] I don't know... [laughs] Um... Well, there was this time... in Madrid. It was after a dinner with this gallery... owner who invited me after an exhibition. You had sex with a gallery owner? - [laughing] Yeah. - No, no, it wasn't. No. - It was his son, actually. - Oh. And the son had also a very cute girlfriend. - Go on. - Come on! - What do you want me to say? - Details. I want details. No, they... They drove me back to my hotel and I guess I had way too much to drink and I definitely just... [chuckles] I couldn't guess what... Well, they just... asked if they could join me up to my room, really... - They did? - Yeah. Did you like it? Yes. Come on. I want to know. [Ines laughs] Really, what do you want me to say? Details? Details. Do you want me to tell how she unbuttoned my blouse and... - how she kissed my breasts? - Yes, yes, you tell me! - I want to know everything. - Why? Because you owe me. [chuckling] We went up to my room. She took my hand... and she laid me down on the bed. And then she pulled my knickers aside and let her tongue glide in. He unbuttoned his trousers and walked... across the room... towards the bed and I turned around and I pulled up her skirt and I licked her beautiful, wonderful cunt... while her boyfriend penetrated me from behind. [laughing] Oh, my God! Happy? When was this? - I don't know. - [laughing] Summer, like, four or five years ago. August. Five years ago. [birds singing] [Ines] How long have you been awake? - Coffee? - Yes, please. What the... What are you doing? Do you have any idea how much work it is to arrange a funeral? [sighs] But you won't be arranging mine, will you? - Emilie... - You'll just hire some... party planner to sort it all out. No, don't. So, while I was... burying Mum alone, you were in Madrid having the best sex of your life. I just can't stand what goes through someone's head when they don't turn up to their own mother's funeral. Maybe it was a case of being constructive. She was dead already. You don't automatically become a better person just because you've lived your life in floods of tears. [Ines] What the fuck! - [Ines and Emilie gasp] - [splattering] What are you doing? - Stop this! Stop this! - [labored breathing] What is it? What's happened? - [wheezing] - Emilie! - I can't breathe. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. - Shh. - [Emilie wheezes and sobs] Gently, gently. I don't want to feel like this! [sobbing] I don't want to be the kind of person who feels like this! [Marina] Emilie, you can do this. You know you can. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on, come on, you can do this. Come on. Come on, we'll go to a quiet place. Come on. There's no point talking when you're like this, - you have to calm down. - [Emilie] I want to know why. [door closes] - [Ines] What? - Why don't... - Don't you respect me? - [sighs] Here we go... You treat me like shit! You left me to take care of Mum. In and out of hospital, just trying to keep her alive. I waited for you to call. She asked for you, do you know that? No. And I lied. Different lies all the time. "She's swamped with work." "Yeah, she called yesterday, but she's broken her leg." I just couldn't tell her you didn't give a fuck about us. You know, I can't be responsible for your happiness. It just doesn't work that way. Life doesn't work that way! - You're not human. - [Ines] Oh, God! You think like a machine. You don't get any bonus points in heaven just because you walk around feeling so bloody sorry for yourself! Maybe that's not the world you want to live in, but that's how it is. That's reality. That's what it's like to be a grown-up. Sometimes you have to shut things out to survive. [hoarsely] That's what everything's always been about. You, and your fucking survival. [footsteps receding] [man] Scroll down, stop, stop. Take out any reference to that woman. Barking mad. Now... down to this side, you know, all those poor people. Can we get into that? [keyboard clacking] May I? [lighter clicks] Yes, now... can we make it look as if I'm hugging a refugee? What are you doing? [man] She can tweak things about you on the net. So that if anybody Googles you in a few years' time... you'll appear to be much nicer than the person you perhaps really are. [Ines] Emilie? - Look. I'm sorry. - [man] Oh. - Google Ines Thomson. - What? - What are you doing? - [woman] Ines Thomson... [keyboard clacking] Uh, there are some photos here, several reviews. Was there something specific you wanted me to change for you? Go ahead. You know how to handle this. [Ines] Wait. Wait! I understand that you must be going through hell right now. You have no fucking idea! [wheezing] - [banging] - [grunting] Oh! I was miles away. Would you like a drink? [glasses tinkle] Your sister is scared. I was naive to bring her here. You are not naive, Emilie. You are thoughtful, kind, and intelligent. And you've done everything you can. Here. [sighs] Why are you here? I came with my husband two years ago. - [Emilie] Where is he now? - He left here. And you've been here ever since? I found no reason to go back. ["Rock n Roll Suicide" by David Bowie playing] [chuckling] [playing classical music] [bell tolls] [bell tolling] [tolling continues] - [insects buzzing] - [birds chirping] - [Emilie] Stop that. No. - [Ines] No. - Emilie? - [Emilie] Come on, Ines. [Ines] Tell me. Tell me where we're going? [Emilie] We're going to the most beautiful place in the world. [Ines] Yeah, you already said that, come on. [Emilie] It's... It's very special. [helicopter whirring] [man] Oh, my back. [indistinct chatter] [woman] This is so nice. [man] Make sure everybody has enough. ...with the biggest electricity bill they've ever had. Excuse me, uh... [clears her throat] - When's that helicopter leaving? - Tomorrow morning. Is there room for one more person? Why? There you are. [laughs] Have a drink. - What's going on? - It's my farewell party. I paid them so much money they couldn't possibly refuse.

You're healthy otherwise. You're not sick. It's just your legs? [man] My whole life went down the drain when I lost them. Everything I was. - But the rest of your body... - I hate this body.

[door opens] - [door closes] - [footsteps approaching] - [glass tinkles] - [water running] [Ines] I can't do this anymore. I can see that. Can't we just go somewhere? Just you and I. Before I leave. [birds singing] [Emilie] So... what will you do when you get home? I don't know. Of course you do. Tell me. What are you doing next week? Um... I've ordered some, uh... Some new... walls for my studio. But I don't know if they're gonna fit through the back door. What else? Uh... Sleep. Sleep, maybe... I'm gonna... start to look for my next project. After those reviews... something new. I guess there'll be... still a lot of work to do. [screams] - [Ines groans] - [grunting] Stop it! [both groaning] You've always left me! You've always left me! [Ines groans] [both groaning] [Ines panting] Emilie! I'm sorry. Emilie? Come here. So... Hey. Wake up. Emilie? Hey... Emilie? Help! Help! [gasping] [moans] [Marina] She doesn't have much time left. But she's not going to die today. [woman] The helicopter is ready. So you're leaving? I just make things worse. There's something I wanted to show you before you go. Just come with me. They'll wait for you. - [insects buzzing] - [birds singing] Go on in. - [door rattles] - [Ines] Open... Open the... - [Ines groans] - [thudding against door] [helicopter whirring overhead] - [birds singing] - [rustling] [Ines] She drowns in her emotions. She's always been like that. Dad left and she and Mum just clung to each other, dragged each other down. I refuse to live my life as a victim. Your mother died of a broken heart. Mum died because of weakness. She died because she couldn't handle life as it is. She stopped going to work. She wouldn't eat. She couldn't... She couldn't pay the bills. She couldn't go and buy cigarettes. So you had to go and do that. You had to go out and buy cigarettes... and milk for the money that you got from social services because your mother was no longer a mother because your family was no longer a family. She failed. Drowning herself in the bath, putting her head in the oven... sleeping pills. Do you know what? When she actually succeeded, that was a relief. Yes. That's how it was when Mum died. A relief. [rustling] [panting] - [rustling] - [birds trilling] - [Marina] Come here, come here. - No, no... [Marina] Come here, come here. Shh. Shh. [Ines whimpering] It's okay. Shh. [Ines] I miss my Mum. I miss her so much. Do you remember that summer in the house? That house out on the islands. Mum borrowed it from someone. - Do you remember? - It was so hot. You taught me to swim. That was the summer before Dad left. There was a piano upstairs. And Dad used to sit and play. The window was open. All night, yeah. It was so hot. I was happy then. Everybody was happy that summer. You used to braid my hair in the morning. [Emilie] There was a kiosk we used to walk to, to buy ice cream. Remember? [Ines] We were bare foot. [Emilie] Sometimes we passed a tractor. [Ines] I held your hand. You held it tight like Mum said you should. You held my hand. [bell tolls] [insects buzzing] [bell tolling] [tolling continues] [woman] Emilie Thompson? - [Emilie] Yes. - Please. [kiss] [woman] I hereby ask you, Emilie Thompson, if you are absolutely certain, answering of your own free will that you wish to leave? Yes. [woman] As you know, it tastes bitter. After you drink it, I will offer you a sweet to take away the taste. Then, a few seconds later, you will fall asleep. And, in a few minutes, your breathing will cease. Are you sure this is what you want? Yes. [gulping] [Emilie breathing deeply] [gagging] [coughing gently] [Emilie breathing deeply] [breathing slows] [breathing stops] - [birds chirping] - [insects buzzing] I have something for you. Tell me. What are you going do with your material? What do you mean? The images you took here. The films. Are you going to use them in your work? I don't know. Be honest with yourself, that's all. [Ines sighs] [Marina] Off you go now. Go on. [man] Thank you so much. ["Rock n Roll Suicide" by David Bowie playing]
