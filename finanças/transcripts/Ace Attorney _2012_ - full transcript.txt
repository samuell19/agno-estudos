RAW provider: Avallach, NiggaElk Japanese subtitle: furransu Translation: OkuraiAni Timing, Editing, QC: OkuraiAni Timing, Editing, QC (Part II): cici / galatia The ... one ... ... the one... The one who... killed me is... Haine... Kotaro. Mother? gyakuten saiban Ace Attorney This clock had been set two hours late. In other words, your testimony that you left the victim's room at two o'clock is clearly questionable. That doesn't necessarily mean that the clock was delayed on the day of the incident. Yes, that's true. Hey! Do not rise from your seat Defendant. Attorney Naruhodo, surely you are aware. The number of criminal cases is five times greater than ten years ago. There is always a big parade of criminals in the court. If one were to hesitate like you, [Joshin Trial: a system where, over three days, the defense and prosecution face each other in an open court to determine the defendant's guilt] there would be no point in adopting the Joshin Trial. Naruhodo! It's over... Objection. We know that you put on a costume of Tonosa-Man and headed towards Studio 1. The script writer clearly testified after we hinted that you were planning to drop him. What are you talking about? I never said such a thing. I merely shared my personal conjecture. The script writer revealed everything. Shut up! That's dirty, Prosecutor Mitsurugi!! Such... such preposterous tactics are not permitted! My methods do not conflict with the law. Your Honor, let us settle this case quickly. That should have the highest priority in the Joshin Trial. Wa-... Please wait! Let's discuss this matter thoroughly. We still three days left. Your Honor, the verdict... Objection! Chihiro-san! The victim had just returned home to Japan the day before the incident. The time difference between Japan and New York is 14 hours. On a clock, it appears as two hours. The victim had not adjusted her clock back. Your Honor, any further discussion is a waste of time. Please give your verdict right now. I pronounce the defendant not guilty. Hey hey hey hey... It's a different guy. WHAT??! No no no, I... I'm Yahari Masashi who won the 'not guilty' verdict! Shouldn't you be interviewing me?? What are you doing with those cameras? Start rolling! Hey, stop. What is this?! Are those toys? Which newspaper are you from? This is a court. Quiet down! What are you looking at? Yappari-kun. It's Yahari! And also Naruhodo-kun. Ignoring me?! Argh!! Congratulations on your acquittal. Ah, that... how do I say this... E-verything's thanks to you, Chihiro-san! I will never forget! Hey! I was your attorney! No way! You would have lost if Chihiro-san hadn't come. True. Right! Wait just a sec... I want you to have this! What is it? Beep! Beep! I think it's about 11:25. Here! It smells... A clock? This guy makes useless things and sells them at his shop. Just say the word if you don't want it. Shut up! This guy isn't just any clock. He has the ability to think together with you in times of trouble. If I pray to this guy, the answer comes out with a BAM! It's that kind of system. Stop trying to push such absurd systems. Here! Oh... Extra! Extra! Extra! Extra! That was excellent, Mitsurugi-kun, [Prosecutor Mitsurugi turns the tables and wins the case The golden boy of prosecution redeems his reputation] winning such a difficult case at your age. I also heard about your victory, sir. I heard it was a trial with little evidence. I want to be like you Karuma-sensei. Like me? Undefeated for 40 years since becoming a prosecutor, winning continuously... That is just a result, not my objective. Let me tell you one thing. Your reputation is not very good. It is definitely important to win during a trial but that does not mean you are allowed to do whatever you please. Yes, sir. Please, help me! Yeah, as if... That's it! With this everything is clear. Naruhodo-kunâ€” Actually, there's this case I've been pursuing for a long time now. Just now I got my hands on important evidence. I think it will cause a big trial now. I want you to help me with that. Tomorrow night, can we meet at the office? Hey, how's the new product? "Tonosa-Man Bun." Even though you say new product, the content is the same as before. [Hyotan Lake Bun] Man... Anybody would take advantage of Tonosa-Man's popularity. Got it Naruhodo? What? Life is about taking advantage. With a bang... to the top! [Ayasato Law Office] Chihiro-san, sorry for being la- Chihiro-san... Chihiro-san! Chihiro-san! Uhm... you are? A- no... ehm... I was... that... ehm... Ah! Before that, an ambulance! Don't move! A- no, ehmâ€¦ It's not what you think! Ehm... I... here in the office of... It isn't ya. A witness saw the moment of the crime. The culprit's a woman. [Mayoi] "Mayoi?" A receipt for a floor lamp. Who on earth... are you? Ayasato... Mayoi. Mayoi? Ayasato you sayâ€¦ Then, you are Chihiro-san's... Ayasato Mayoi, ya're arrested! The said Ayasato family is a spirit medium clan. Medium? Then... you mean you are, too? I'm still in training. My father passed away when I was little. As for my mother... I don't know where she is. For me... I only had my sister left. Uhm... If you don't mind, will you let me defend you? I will be your ally. What do you think? OK. All right. Then, why were you at our office last night? I got a phone call from my sister. I think I still have the recorded message on my cell phone. You'll come back here for Christmas, right? It's been a long time since you've shown up here, hasn't it? Oh yeah, yesterday I received something interesting. It is a talking table clock shaped like "The Thinker." You like toys like these, right? Ah, but it isn't a clock anymore. Then... I'll be waiting for you, OK? Oh, uhm... regarding Chihiro-san, what did the autopsy show? Ah, ya really wanna know? Ah, yes. Wellâ€¦ 'right then. Ayasato Chihiro's autopsy record. Thank you. Ya also workin' hard, huh? Hey, 's useless. Ya won't find anything. Ya won't win this trial. Eh? Since that Prosecutor Mitsurugi Reiji's in charge of this case. We finally meet, Mitsurugi. What are you doing in a place like this, Naruhodo Ryuichi? Why did you become a prosecutor? I was sure... What about you Mitsurugi? I... will become a great attorney like my father! An attorney? Yeah. Seriously an attorney? Yeah. An attorney, huh? What about you Ryuichi? Hmm... that's a secret! Heh? Eh, tell us! More like, there isn't anything. That guy sure has changed. What are you doing here? [Joshin Trial Admission Ticket December 24, 2012 â€” Starts 11:00 Central Grand Court â€” Case Number KF-3] The Government of Japan, in response to the increase in violent felonies, introduced a new judicial system, the "Joshin Saiban", where attorneys and prosecutors directly face each other in an open court. It is the only preceding system that determines the defendant's guilt or innocence within 3 days. I now declare the Joshin Trial for the murder case of Attorney Ayasato open. The Defense is ready. The Prosecution will begin. The Prosecution is providing evidence that the defendant committed the crime as well as eye-witness testimony. The defendant is, without a doubt, guilty. I call the first witness to the stand. Witness: Detective Itonokogiri You were at the crime scene and arrested Ayasato Mayoi. Why? Ya! There was irrefutable evidence. Blood charactersâ€¦ coz the victim wrote them with her own blood before death. This dying messageâ€” Understood! "Mayoi" was written in blood. Also, bloodstains were found on the victim's finger. The lab test results confirmed that both blood samples belong to the victim Ayasato Chihiro. That is all. The Defense may begin the cross-examination. Yes. Detective Itonokogiri, so you claim that the victim Chihiro-san wrote these letters? 'course! Nobody else could have written it. Objection!! On the contrary, Chihiro-san is the the only person who could NOT have written it. Wha? Take this! [A single blow by a blunt object, instant death] According to the autopsy record, she was killed instantly with a single blow by a blunt object. She was already dead! Huh? What do you mean "huh!" Objection! Attorney, this autopsy record is outdated. Actually, yesterday a re-examination was done. Eh? "However, there is a possibility that the victim lived for several minutes after the blow" This sentence had been added. That... it can't be... Therefore there was time to write "Mayoi." Your Honor, I didn't hear anything of this record! Silence! Unfortunately, this report is an official record. The court accepts it as evidence. Then next, I call the eye-witness who reported the crime to take the stand. Witness: Konaka Masaru Witness, state your name and occupation. Konaka Masaru, freelancer. I have been working as a magazine reporter. Konaka Masaru? Written as small, medium and large; Konaka Masaru's Trial Report Article Konaka Masaru Konaka Masaru. The night the incident happened, while drinking lemon tea I looked out of the window. I saw the victim being beaten by that oddly dressed girl. I was extremely shocked when I saw this. Did you see the weapon clearly? Oh, "The Thinker," that was it, I'm sure. Yes, that's right. This clock. That's enough. Your Honor, any more wasteful interrogation isâ€¦ Objection. What is the matter, Attorney? Your Honor, the witness said something very unexpected just now. Konaka-san, you called this is a "clock." Is that right? Yes. Your Honor, does this look like a clock to you? Eh? No, now that I look... Even in the court records it is listed as "Statue of The Thinker." That's right. At first glance it's just a simple statue. Only after turning its head one would know that it's a clock. An extremely unusual system. And yet, how did you know that this is a clock? That is... uh... Yes, because I heard the clock say the time. The hotel and the crime scene are very close. It is not unreasonable to have heard it. Huh? Defense, can you explain this? Ah... uhm... that... Defense, your explanation? No, uhm... just a moment, eh... Please wait a moment! Apparently this is as far as you go. I'm certain... My sister, she said, "it isn't a clock anymore." It is a talking table clock shaped like "The Thinker." Ah, but it isn't a clock anymore. Then this concludes the cross-exaâ€” Hold it! I'm sorry. The Defense requests immediate examination of the clock. At the time of the incident, this clock had already become just a statue. How about that, Witness? Do you still say that you heard the sound of the clock? Please answer. I've seen the place where they are sold. Where did you see it? Incidentally, there's only one place in the world that sells this troublesome clock. Well, your answer please. Witness, did you perhaps... forget? That's it. I forgot! I've forgotten! Don't cha lie about that! Although I am certain that I've seen them being sold somewhere. Silence. Although I'm somewhat unsatisfied with the explanation, it can't be helped if you've forgotten. Defense, is there anything else? Ah... yes, uhm... Yes. Why... did you look out of the window in the first place? Outside the window, I heard the sound of breaking glass. Glass? You see, the floor lamp made of glass that fell over. Was there such a thing in our office? There were indeed scattered glass shards at the crime scene. Objection. If you looked out of the window because of the sound of broken glass, you couldn't have known that it was a floor lamp. It would have already been broken. Such minor details don't matter. In any case, I saw the lamp before it fell. Hmm, that is not possible. When viewing the firm from your hotel room, these are the visible areas. Konaka Masaru Corpse Witness, where was the floor lamp? If you look at the dispersion of the glass shards, it becomes clear. It was... Konaka Masaru here. Floor lamp In other words, as long as you were at the hotel you could not have known about the existence of the floor lamp. At the moment of the crime, you were not at the hotel. Were you not at the crime scene? So annoying! [sekarashika: Kyushu Dialect for ã‚ã‚“ã©ãã›ã‡] If I said that I was at the hotel, I was at the hotel! [T/N: Yes, more Kyushu Dialect~] If I told ya I was drinkin' the lemon tea, I did that! Witness, why don't you gracefully admit your crime? Actually, this witness had been wiretapping the office of Ayasato Chihiro. The cover of the telephone came off, right? He thoughtlessly installed a wiretap on the phone. It was found during the investigation of the crime scene. When he broke into the office to install this, the witness saw the floor lamp. At that time he probably heard about the talking clock. I see. Witness, do you admit to placing the wiretap? Admit it, Witness. OK. I slipped in one week before the incident. This witness is guilty of trespassing and wiretapping. However, that is irrelevant to this case. I understand. Then we shall end the cross-examination. AH!! I'm sorry, timeout. I mean, please wait a moment. No... Naruhodo-kun. You shouldn't give up. You have already won. Attorney, is something wrong? Eh, no... Uhm... that! There that, that... What? Eh? You have already won. Naruhodo-kun, the truth is in your hands. Defense, is something the matter? There is nothing more miserable than an attorney who doesn't know when to quit. The witness did not see the floor lamp when he installed the wiretap. Take this! We already settled the matter with these characters. That isn't the problem. It's on the back. Is this the floor lamp's... Floor Lamp $ 331 December 21, 4:09 p.m. receipt? Yes. According to this date, it was issued a little after 4:00 p.m. on the day before the incident. 21st December, 4:09 p.m. In other words, when the witness broke into the office a week earlier that floor lamp was not there yet. Konaka-san, you saw the lamp on the night of the crime at the murder scene! The Defense insists that this witness is the actual murderer who killed Ayasato Chihiro-san. Wait! The only thing you proved is that I was at the crime scene! It doesn't mean I killed her. You've been talking nonsense since a while ago... You got that?! I didn't kill anybody! Hey, you and your damn unreasonable puss! Come on! Come, come here, hey! Order! With this, Witness Konaka's testimony that he saw the crime is fundamentally overthrown. Prosecutor Mitsurugi, is there anything else? The Court will now declare the verdict for Defendant Ayasato Mayoi. Not Guilty. [Not Guilty] That attorney isn't half bad. It's just a fluke. Ugh... Screw this! I'm leaving! Ya leaving's definitely troubling. I'll ensure your instant custody. Why did you kill my sister? It's related to the wiretapping, right? Please answer me. It's because of the incident from 15 years ago, isn't it?! You ruined my mother, and this time my sister... Mayoi-chan! Konaka! Why... Why did you kill my sister?! Answer! Konaka! Earlier in the courtroom, you mentioned "the incident from 15 years ago." Can I ask you about this? In her last call Chihiro-san talked about an incident that she had been pursuing for a long time. The... one... who... shot... me was... Haine... Kotaro... The arrested suspect Haine Kotaro has come out. One week after the incident, he has finally been arrested. Konaka published an article that strongly criticized the investigation method, creating a stir. [Headline: Medium to support investigation in the DL6 incident] My mother disappeared from our sight ever since. [Headline: Public is at a loss for words] [Headline: Fake medium Ayasato Maiko held accountable] Chihiro-san had said, "it will cause a big trial now." I guess it was the DL6 incident. Actually, I was supposed to have helped her with that. That's why... Yeah... That's why I think I'll try to continue Chihiro-san's pursuit. Uhm... Is it OK if I help, too? Eh? Speaking of which, that day Chihiro-san said she got her hands on "important evidence." Did you hear anything about it? With this everything is clear. I searched the office, but I didn't find anything. It may have fallen into Konaka's hands and disposed of. The DL6 incident 15 years ago... in the evidence depository located in the basement of the court, an attorney was killed. The weapon was... an archived handgun. The main suspect Haine Kotaro pleaded insanity, and without the ability for criminal liability was found innocent. Merry Christmas. [Caption: Attorney Mitsurugi Shin murdered] [Subline: Mitsurugi Shin, age 35] The victim was Mitsurugi's father. Naruhodo-kun! Naruhodo-kun! Naruhodo-kun, the TV! TV, the television! Come on, turn on the TV, hurry! Eh, what? What? What?! Uhm, I think we took the photo here, both looking this way, and it went "Don!" and we looked behind us. [TV screen: Behind the couple a mysterious huge creature appeared] It was incredibly huge! Hyotan Lake Â· witnessed scene Photo taken on that day Experts sayâ€” from the photo the estimated length from head to neck is 10 m And... this mysterious mighty creature, in honor of the Hyotan Lake, was named Hyosshi. Hyosshi? Gee, how scary... Ah, not this one... Here at Hyotan Lake a shocking murder occurred. The arrested suspect is 25-year-old Mitsurugi Reiji. The Hero Prosecutor has really been arrested. Late last night Suspect: Mitsurugi Reiji (25) Archival footage there was an anonymous report about two gunshots. When the police came rushing, the suspect Mitsurugi was found carrying a handgun, That must be a lie... and was arrested on the spot. Based on the testimony of the suspect Mitsurugi, the lake was searched. The body of a man, who was shot with a handgun, was found this morning. The victim's identity is currently being determined by the police. I didn't want to be seen like this. Especially by you. Mitsurugi, I want to help you. Help? Me? Stop being so conceited. You're just a rookie attorney who has been in court two times. If I wanted an attorney, there are plenty out there more skilled than you. Officer, we're finished. Wait a second. Hey, Mitsurugi! This time, I... How did it go? Well... he asked for a more outstanding attorney. That's only natural, I guess. 's not it. There's not one attorney that would represent Prosecutor Mitsurugi. Well, he is an enemy to all of those whose clients were found guilty because of him. Uhm... Prosecutor Mitsurugi's defenseâ€¦ thatâ€¦ I want ya to do it. Even so, Mitsurugi looks like he absolutely doesn't want me toâ€¦ Oh... Uhm... why go to such lengths for Prosecutor Mitsurugi? Prosecutor Mitsurugi gets his convictions at all costs because he believes in our police investigation more than anyone else. That's why... That's why I also want to answer to that trust. He's a trustworthy person. Hey, what happened? Usually no one is here... Perhaps it's that "Hyosshi" or whatever monster. Geez... Naruhodo-kun, over there. Is that a device that activates a shutter in reaction to a sound? NA---RU----HO---DO------!!! You're embarrassing me. Can you stop that? KUN--- HEY!! Shut up, what cha doin'? [T/N: Natsumi talks in Kansai Dialect] Don't cha play with my camera! Ah, I'm sorry. Mayoi-chan, let's go. Isn't that broken? Like it'd bother reacting to a cheesy-looking woman like you. This guy here is lookin' for a bigger sound full of adventure! Cheesy woman you say... Ya aren't cheesy? Ya don't have even a speck of adventure! This adventure you speak of... Huh? [Headline: The mysterious giant creature in Hyotan Lake] Wow, amazing...! Hyosshi really does exist. Let's see... "A-san set the automatic shutter release and when the lovers lined up there was a loud cry." Hyosshi will appear with a "Gao!" cry and then, this camera will trigger. It's a trouble-free photographing plan. You mean, even if it isn't Hyosshi's cry, if it's a big sound, it will trigger, right? For example, a gunshot perhaps? Let's see, first there's this. There's nothing... 11:30 p.m. How about afterwards? After it became the 25th... Woah, the handgun was photographed so clearly! Wait a minute. Who are ya guys? He's an attorney, as you can see. So ya are on the criminal's side, huh? I gotta go to the police station now. Looking at the photos reminded me... I witnessed this incident. Could you also let us hear your story? Idiot, I'm an ally of justice, so I'm on the police's side. There's no reason to tell you guys. Well, bye then. Hey. Looks like they know the identity of the victim. Ah, ouch... The victim is 58-year-old Namakura Yukio-san. Namakura-san was an acute attorneyâ€” Namakura Yukio? Attorney: Namakura Yukio-san Responsible for the DL6 incident It hadn't ended yet. This incident and Chihiro-san's incident are connected. But... my sister's killer was already caught by the police. That's not it. Somehow, something even larger is lurking. The victim Namakura Yukio was Haine's attorney in the DL6 incident. You... looked into it? Yeah. Stop doing unnecessary things! It has nothing to do with you. It has. My mentor Chihiro-san was investigating that incident for long time. Chihiro-san and Mayoi-chan are the daughters of the medium that was involved in the DL6 incident. Is that so? Moreover, Mitsurugi, your father was murdered in that incident. I have to investigate this. I sincerely feel sorry about Ayasato Chihiro. But, just leave me alone. I'm sorry, but I can't do that. I owe you a large debt. It was when we were elementary school students when that guy was put on a class trial. Lunch expenses 3800 Yen; case of theft [3800 Yen is approximately 50 Dollars] OK! Everyone sit down! You were the only one that was absent from gym class. It was about that time the lunch money disappeared. Thief. I... didn't do it... Liar. Give Terada-kun back his lunch money! That's right, return it. Thief! Lunch money thief! Everyone! OK, please quiet down! Naruhodo-kun is not a bad person. It was a little passing fancy, right? So, let's apologize to everyone. Objection! You weren't the one who stole it, right? Uh... yes. Then you should act more confidently. At a trial the only meaningful things are evidence. There is no evidence that he did it. In other words, Sensei, he is innocent. That's right! Didn't he just say that he didn't do it?! Back then, you believed me and helped me. Because of that trial, I'm here right now. Naruhodo... You're right. I still lack experience, but I will fight with all my strength. So... I want you to let me defend you. Lunch expenses of 3800 Yen... That was the reason why Naruhodo-kun became an attorney? In life, you'll never now, huh? That guy Mitsurugi too, why did he become a prosecutor? Do as you please. Nobody is going to take it on anyway. Tell me about the incident, OK? Tell me the truth. No matter what, I'll believe you until the end. That night, I was called upon by Namakura Yukio. "I have something to tell you about the DL6 incident. On December 25 at midnight, come to the park's boat shed at Hyotan Lake." Merry Christmas. What on earth happened? I have absolutely no idea... Is that person really that great? It's said that he has been undefeated for 40 years. Oh! Undefeated for 40 years? And on top of that, he's a workaholic. He only took leave once in 40 years. Huh? In those 40 years he only took time off one time. He was out for one day 15 years ago. Prosecutor Karuma! Naruhodo-sensei. Ah, yes! I'm glad that Mitsurugi-kun has an outstanding attorney. Well, let's make this fair and square, shall we? Ah... So then... Court is now in session Hyotan Lake Attorney shooting incident for the "Hyotan Lake Attorney shooting incident." The Defense is ready, Your Honor. The Prosecution is ready. The Prosecution is providing decisive evidence as well as a crucial witness. I call our first witness to the stand. Witness: Oosawagi Natsumi It was the night of Christmas Eve, about past midnight. I was inside the car, when I heard a "Bang!" sound from the lake. When I looked through the window, there were two men on a boat. That's when I heard that sound once more and there was only one man left on the boat. She happened to have photographed these scenes. This is in fact very crucial evidence. Defense, your cross-examination please. Focus Naruhodo-kun. Uhm... Past midnight on Christmas Eve means... more precisely... Christmas? You ask lousy questions, huh? Please answer! That's right, it was Christmas. So what about it? What's next? Next... Are you certain you saw the two men? Take a look at the photos! It's clearly shown there! I'm asking whether you saw them or not. Yeah, I have. You're just making her repeat her testimony. Your Honor, I've always believed that useless questioning constitutes a contempt of court. Therefore, if that rookie attorney makes further meaningless remarks, I demand his immediate removal from the court! Defense, be careful with your following statements. Yes. Defense, is there anything else? Yes. Yes... uhm... It doesn't appear so. Then with that, we end the cross-examination. Please wait! Are you an associate of the Defense? Natsumi-san, please tell the truth! Witness, that's an illicit question. There is no need to answer. Did you clearly see it? The place where Prosecutor Mitsurugi shot the handgun? Such remarks are prohibited! Mayoi-chan! I beg you! A human life is at stake! What is that? Treating me like I'm the bad guy. I clearly saw this Onii-chan here. Your Honor, I request the Defense be held in contempt of court. Hmm... Attorney, I order you to leave the courtroom. Ah... Objection. The one who made the illicit remark was her, not the attorney. The one who should leave the courtroom is... Very well. The only thing left is the verdict, so... Hold it! Just now the witness said that she clearly saw the defendant. This is new testimony. As you can see, the faces of the men on the boat are not visible at all here. And yet, why is it that you clearly saw the defendant's face? I... I saw it with binoculars, since the fog was thick. Originally, you were at the lake to catch a glimpse of Hyosshi, weren't you? That's right, but... In that case when you heard the loud sound, you would have searched for any signs of Hyosshi first. In other words, you wouldn't have given much attention to a small boat. I didn't mean to lie! I thought I could become the witness of a murder case. That made me a little happy. I'm not too convinced that I saw the man on the boat. Ah... I'll go home now and what's more, Hyosshi's waitin' for me. Sorry, yeah? What a troublemaker... What are your thoughts, Prosecutor Karuma? There were only two people on the boat that night: Prosecutor Mitsurugi and the victim Attorney Namakura. Since Attorney Namakura was the one who got shot, then the shooter can be none other than the defendant himself. Objection! There was one other person that could have shot Attorney Namakura. Who would that be? Attorney Namakura himself. It can't be ruled out that... he shot himself with the handgun. How foolish. Silence. This court cannot ignore a new possibility. The interrogation will continue tomorrow. Court dismissed. Thank you! I managed to postpone the hearing. That's all I can do. All right then, let's go investigate! Yeah! It's a gourd. [Hyotan means gourd] Well, it is Hyotan Lake... Squid. France... That, that there! I wonder what it is? Huh? Ah, really! Seriously, what is this?! Hey! Man... I wonder what that is? Naruhodo-kun, let's give up... I have a bad feeling. Shh! Naruhodo-kun, it's Tonosa-Man! Hey, didn't you get rid of that useless thing? Tonosa-Man Chop! Ouch! Nonsense! If you keep such a guy, the children will be buying manjuu as if they were obsessed. Children like her. Oh... Tonosa-Man is injured. Oh that? I really had a rough time. How many days ago was it? When I tried to add air into that guy with this air tank... Shoot!! Nessie? This is Hyotan Lake, so... Hyosshi?! No way... Hyosshi's true identity... was the deflated Tonosa-Man? A metal detector! That Tonosa-Man guy took the air tank with him. Thanks to this guy I managed to find him. Mayoi-chan, this... [Headline: Suspect Konaka wiretapping clients?] Konaka was just a chess piece. There is someone else manipulating him from the shadows. Ya better say somethin'! Quit screwin' around! Silence. The person who reported the incident? It was said that he was "missing" yesterday, but... He can't escape our grasp. Today he was summoned as a new witness; Hyotan Lake's boat shed caretaker. Witness: Boat Shed's Caretaker Witness, your name and occupation are? I... At that lake... Sometimes I lend out boats, other times I get them back. And when I feel like it, I sometimes try riding one myself. Witness, please state your name. That is... I'm not too sure of it. What do you mean by that? Your Honor, this witness has no memory beyond several years ago. Objection. He lacks the qualification as a witness. The attestor witnessed the incident three days ago. There is no problem with his testimony. Indeed. The Defense's objection is overruled. That is... It was... a little past midnight on the 25th. Thank you. Shortly after I notified the police, a boat came back and an Onii-san stepped in front of my window. It was that fluttering person over there, yes. That night the fog should have been thick. Can you affirm that it truly was the defendant? Yes, it certainly was that fluttering man. Ah, yes and he said while fluttering, "I never thought I would shoot a person," yes. Objection! I've never said such a thing! Moreover... I wasn't fluttering to that extent! Hey, aren't you fluttering? Silence! Defendant, do not interrupt the testimony. Your Honor, the testimony right now... It's too questionable! Questionable? Very well. So, what is your basis, Attorney? Basis? And the evidence to support it? Evidence... Onee-chan, help Naruhodo-kun. It seems there is nothing, is there? No. Hold on... With that we end the cross-examination. Huh?! I pronounce the defendant Mitsurugi Reiji Guilty. Wait a sec! What's with that person? Who is he? Wha... what are you doing? You know, I just remembered today that gunshot. Gunshot? Yeah. Your Honor, he is a witness for the Defense. For the Defense? That's nonsense! The verdict has already been given! I demand the hearing's closure! Naruhodo-kun, Yappari-san is giving us a last chance! Your Honor, as long as there is a witness, we must listen to his testimony. That is not necessary. Overthrowing a judgment is not possible. A verdict without listening to all testimony is unacceptable, You Honor. Enough testimony was given to declare a verdict! There is no problem here Your Honor. I will express my thoughts. In any case and situation, a wrong verdict is to be avoided at all costs. I hereby withdraw the guilty verdict. Witness, please come to the stand. All right! Witness: Yahari Masashi You know, that night I was riding in a boat, lookin' for something. So after I found it, I secretly returned the boat to the boat shed. And when I thought I'd go home... ... I heard the said sound. I didn't hear anything after that so I just went back. That sound you heard, was only one time? That's what I'm telling you, right? But all the other witnesses heard two. Were you paying attention? Well, to tell the truth... I can't say for sure. Huh? No, look, I listen to the radio with earphones. So I might've missed ... one gunshot. Hey, what's wrong with listening to the radio? It was Christmas Eve! I wanted someone to whisper gently into my ear! Well, although the DJ was an old man with a hoarse voice. "Well, Christmas Eve's gonna end in another 30 minutes. The following number is everyone's favorite, 'Jingle Bells.' Check it out!" was what he said! Yahari! Are you certain of what you just said? Absolutely. Your Honor, he just testified that, when the DJ said "Christmas Eve's gonna end in another 30 minutes," he heard a gunshot. He heard the gunshot before midnight. Up until now all of the witnesses heard a gunshot after midnight. These are clearly different circumstances. Objection. He just made a mistake. There were photos taken at the moment of the gunshot. Look. Both pictures were indeed taken after midnight. Objection! Yahari, Yahari's... hn? Ah... the witness is not mistaken. Take that! That night, one more picture was taken. There's nothing in this picture though. It doesn't matter what was photographed. The question is... why does that picture exist in the first place? The camera that took this photo was set so that the shutter is released in response to a loud sound. In other words, the time this photo was taken, 11:30 p.m., there was a loud sound as well. This matches the time the witness heard the gunshot. Objection! Prosecutor Karuma! The situation has already changed. What do you mean? As this photo points out, there is a possibility that the actual crime was 11:30 p.m. Then, Attorney, just who on earth was the guy on the boat together with the defendant Mitsurugi Reiji? Well? Of course, it was someone disguising himself as victim Attorney Namakura... The real murderer. December 24th, 11:30 p.m. December 25th, 12:15 a.m. This incident's real culprit... there is a person that crosses my mind. However, I don't know his name. You don't know? Because he never said it. The DL6 incident, don't forget it. I request the interrogation of the boat shed's caretaker. Silence. Where is the previous witness? That is... he's nowhere to be found. That... it seems he has gone back home. Didn't he just run away? The Prosecution and the police will ensure the custody of that witness. Today's hearing ends here. Your Honor, what if the person in question can't be secured? Tomorrow is the last day of the trial. In that case, I will directly advance to the judgment. Court is dismissed for today. Sayuri-san, I've kept you waiting, haven't I? Attorney-sensei! Yes. An emergency deployment was enacted. I will definitely find the boat shed's caretaker. Thank you. Let's go! Yes! Excuse me, Oji-san! Oji-san, are you there?! I'm coming in! Looks like nobody's here. Yeah. I smell something sweet. Huh? Mayoi-chan? This is risky. If we get caught it'll get complicated. Naruhodo-kun. This! The details of the murder plans are all written here. That sounds just like you. But with this it has become clear. There is a mastermind behind the incident. Yeah. Konaka Masaru who killed Chihiro-san... That guy was also manipulated by someone to wiretap the office. I think this mastermind is probably the same person. Tomorrow, I'm calling Konaka to the stand. I just finished submitting the witness application. Naruhodo, there's something you haven't told me yet. What was written in the letter that was taken away? "The time has come to take revenge on Namakura Yukio and Mitsurugi Reiji, the ones who destroyed your life. Don't forget the DL6 incident." Therefore, the Defense insists that there was no opportunity for the defendant to obtain a gun. Objection. This morning, this was discovered from the defendant's home. Here is the film of the bullet from the crime scene. Let us compare these ballistic markings with those on the bullet from the handgun we found. Verification 100% matching rate That can't be... We confirm the defendant's violation of firearm possession with conclusive evidence. Father... Is somebody there? Who is it? Attorney Mitsurugi, what are you doing? You can't possibly... the evidence! Stop! Reiji! You were there, too? Reiji... What do you think my father was doing there? The handgun... He was trying to destroy the trial's evidence. I have absolutely no intention of becoming an attorney like my father! Yeah... Naruhodo-kun! What's the matter? Konaka was... Shit. They beat us. For the mastermind's hand to reach such a place... It's all right, Mitsurugi. As an attorney, I will be your ally until the end. I absolutely won't give up. Naruhodo, there is something that I've been thinking for a while. The caretaker of the boat shed that disappeared... Maybe... "Suspect Haine Kotaro's wife, Sayuri-san." Just now it seems that Attorney Naruhodo has arrived. Attorney Naruhodo! Good timing. About Ayasato Chihiro's incident, the investigation has finished, so I'd like to return the evidence to you. Umm... I'll go. OK. Thank you. Detective-san, how is Detective Itonokogiri doing? The police searched diligently, but it seems that custody of the boat shed's caretaker has not been secured. Then it's not possible to verify yesterday's hypothesis, is it? Defense, what do you say about this? Well... then... Witness Yahari Masashi's testimony, once more! No! No more! Attorney, even if you drag this on to buy time, that witness will not come. Nnnnoooooooo.... bbbbuuuuttt... hhhooowwweever... Stop trying to buy time! I understand. Then, the final judgment... Y-... You! Ta-... [Taiho translates as Arrest] Taiho-kun... Sorry to keep ya waitin'! Hey. I wasn't running away or anything like that. I just went to buy Sayuri-san's feed, yes. Sayuri-san is? It's my parrot's name. Sayuri... Witness, today, please start off by telling us your name. Objection! It was testified yesterday, that this witness lost his memory. If so, we will help him remember. Witness, your name is Haine Kotaro, isn't it? Haine Kotaro... If I remember correctly, he was the defendant of the DL6 incident that took place 15 years ago, correct? That's right. Witness, you killed Attorney Namakura to get revenge for the DL6 incident. Are you not trying to place the blame on the defendant? Wait a minute, Attorney. This is a court. Before you call the witness Haine-shi, ["-shi" is an intermediary form between "-san" and "-sama" in terms of politeness] present your evidence first. The name of Haine-shi's deceased wife is "Sayuri." The same name as the parrot's. Objection! It's just a mere coincidence. I agree. Naruhodo, the fingerprints. Right! I request to have the witness's fingerprints analyzed. I am sorry. That is impossible. Huh? Impossible? I am sorry, I... I don't have fingerprints. He... most likely ended up burned at the chemical plant he was working at before. If he doesn't have fingerprints, a certification would be difficult, wouldn't it? Hey Naruhodo! Hey! Like I said, the times when you're worried, leave it to my "that," remember? My "that!" Right, "that!" This, this there! What are you saying at a time like this! Never mind that and try praying! The answer will come out with a BAM!... maybe. Sayuri-san, it's already over so let's go back home. Zero Â· Two; Mobile:... Sayuri-san, shh! Shh! If you can't prove that the witness is Haine-shi, then any further questioning is meaningless. ... Bank: If there are no other witnesses... Hold it! If you want witnesses, there is one... Zero Â· Two;... Shh, shh! Really. Shh, be quiet! Who is it? Zero Â· Two; Bank: Sayuri-san, be quiet. Sayuri-san! ... it is. Huh? What was that? I call Sayuri-san to the witness stand! What are you going to do, Naruhodo-kun? What should I do, Mayoi-chan... Huh? Witness: Sayuri-san Then, Witness, what's your name? I'm hungry. Defense, this might be impossible after all? As a witness, this parrot isn't suitable. Or rather... it is too suitable, right Attorney?! The previous witness couldn't state his name either! I'm hungry. I beg you, Sayuri-san. Safe: One Â· One Â· Zero Â· Two; Mobile: Zero Â· Six Â· Zero Â· Oh man... Two; Bank: Your Honor, the interrogation Zero Â· Nine Â· is over. One Â· Two; Safe: One Â· One Â· Zero Â· Two; Mobile: Zero Â· Six Â· Zero Â· Two; Bank: Zero Â· ... Please wait! Please take a look at this. Zero Â· Two; Haine Sayuri Mobile: Zero Â· Six Â· Zero Â· Two; November 2: Birth September 12: Marriage June 2: Death The numbers that the parrot memorized are identical to the dates concerning Haine Sayuri-san. Objection! That's too far-fetched! This is nothing more than mere coincidence! Indeed, it would be problematic to use this as evidence. Sayuri-san, isn't there anything else? Please talk, I beg you. You're a parrot, right? That's right! You're hungry, aren't you? Do you have any feed? Shh... Here, the feed. Thanks. Sayuri-san, will you talk for me? That's it. Sayuri-san. It was asking for too much, wasn't it? OK, Sayuri-san. Sayuri-san, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. It was too much. Sayuri-san, I'm sorry. I... love you, Kotaro-san. Kotaro-san. What was that just now? I'm sorry, Sayuri-san. I love you, Kotaro-san. Your Honor, Haine-shi's first name is Kotaro. This links the witness and Haine-shi... Attorney Mitsurugi, what are you doing? That's enough. I have accomplished my purpose. With that, let's end this for good. So you are... Haine Kotaro. As you said, I killed Namakura. But why? In the trial 15 years ago, Attorney Namakura was, for your murder charges... I didn't do it! The one who killed me is... Haine... Kotaro. NO! I... didn't kill Attorney Mitsurugi! And yet, Namakura! That guy... You want to be found innocent, right? A guilty verdict at your trial will be bad for my firm and reputation. So... admit the crime and plead insanity. Eh? I really didn't do it! Whether you killed him or didn't kill him, it doesn't matter to me. I will pronounce the judgment for the defendant Haine Kotaro. Not guilty. At the time of the incident, the defendant, who had fallen into an unstable state of mind due to excessive labor and lack of sleep, was not able to make sound judgment... Get out murderer! The murderer should disappear right now!! [T/N: all of these are hate-filled messages towards Haine] Die! Haine is a murderer! Don't forgive the murderer! Get out murderer! Murderer off limits! I'm home. Sayuri? Sayuri? I'm sorry, Sayuri. I love you, Kotaro-san. I'm sorry... Sayuri. I love you, Kotaro-san. The time has come to take revenge on Namakura Yukio and Mitsurugi Reiji, the ones who destroyed your life. Don't forget the DL6 incident. I no longer have any regrets. All that's left is to go to where Sayuri is. I'm sorry, Sayuri. I... love you... Kotaro-san. I... love you... Kotaro-san. I love you, Kotaro-san. I love you, Kotaro-san. Then, who on earth was it? The one who killed Attorney Mitsurugi, the father of the defendant? Your Honor, I will confess right here. No matter how it happened, the one who killed Mitsurugi Shin was me. What do you mean? Silence! About the recent murder of Attorney Namakura, the suspicion of the defendant Mitsurugi Reiji can be considered cleared. However, about an incident that is closely related to this case a serious confession has been made. We are going to take a recess here and then continue to investigate the DL6 incident. Naruhodo, it's useless. I told you, this time, I will believe in you until the end. I will prove your innocence, even though you suspect yourself. It is time. 15 years ago, my father, trying to destroy evidence, a handgun, had been caught by Haine-shi and the two got into a violent brawl. Stop! At that time, something grazed my hand. It... was the handgun. Reiji... I then threw it, desperate to help my father. The handgun went off sending a bullet through my father. It was a dreadful scream, that I still can't forget. So the truth of the incident from 15 years ago has finally been revealed. Objection! Before the incident, according to the records of the evidence depository, there were two bullets left in the handgun's magazine. And after the incident the magazine was empty. In other words, two shots had been fired off. Assuming that one shot was due to the fact that the defendant threw the handgun and it going off, when and who fired off the other bullet? Objection! Another bullet you say? There's no such thing! If two bullets were shot, they would have been found at the scene. Were they found? Yes. There was only one bullet found at the scene. Please wait! For example, well... The second bullet was... that... Right! Someone had taken it. How about that? How... "How about that?" you say, but who on earth? That, of course, is... the culprit. Looks like your culprit is not very intelligent. Just like you. Naruhodo-kun. It's all right. You're not mistaken. Just one more step. Yes, reverse your idea. Reverse the idea? Is something wrong? Reversal? Defense? The culprit had no intention of taking the bullet... Ah, that's not quite it. What if he had no choice but to take it? "Had no choice?" What does that mean? For example, the criminal was shot. If he were shot, then he'd have no choice but to take it with him. But there were no other injuries on Mitsurugi Reiji or Haine Kotaro and they were the only ones in the evidence depository. So there had to have been... one more person there. Haine... I really didn't do it! Kotaro. There is a mastermind behind the incident. Father... We confirm the defendant's violation of firearm possession with conclusive evidence. Aside from Mitsurugi Reiji and Haine Kotaro, there was one other person involved in the DL6 incident. 15 years ago, that person was fighting with the victim Mitsurugi Shin in court. That... Prosecutor Karuma, was you! Silence! Umm, Prosecutor Karuma? A workaholic like yourself, who in 40 years of work, has only taken a single day off. Wasn't it because you were shot that time? If we find the doctor who treated your injuryâ€” It's useless. Prosecutor Karuma is always striving for perfection. Records of receiving treatment... Clues like that would not be left behind. I feel no need to make a counter-argument against this. But to be clear, there are no treatment records or doctor witnesses. Well... well then, like this you dug out the bullet with your own hands... something like that? That would hurt, Naruhodo-kun! Such a thing is impossible! Then, what happened to the bullet? What's up? Prosecutor Karuma didn't receive medical treatment... If that's the case... the bullet might be still left "there." That's nonsense. What are you suggesting? It is easy to determine whether it's nonsense or not. Yahari! Hmm? Lend me that. That's enough! Hurry and hand it over! Prosecutor Karuma, I will examine your body with this metal detector. I refuse! I beg your pardon? Your Honor, an examination is necessary in order to find the truth. To refuse is like admitting that there is a bullet in your body. Defense, I permit the use of the metal detector. What is this? Indeed... there is indeed a bullet in my shoulder. However, this is unrelated to the DL6 incident. In the court evidence is everything. If you insist that I'm a criminal, then provide evidence that links my shoulder's bullet with the DL6 incident. Please check the handgun from the DL6 incident. If we compare the ballistic markings of the bullet in Prosecutor Karuma's body, it should match perfectly. Officers, check it immediately. The handgun should be in the evidence depository. Aren't you awesome Naruhodo! Your Honor! The handgun is missing. I beg your pardon? Isn't that too bad, Attorney? There's no way to prove it now. Even though we've come this far... Chihiro-san... I'm sorry. That's it! So that's what it was... The evidence Chihiro-san risked her life for... It was hidden here. Take that! This is the bullet that was extracted from Attorney Mitsurugi's body. If we have this, the handgun isn't needed. If the ballistic markings match with the bullet inside your body, that is decisive evidence. I admit... I was in the evidence depository when it happened, and I was shot with that stray bullet. However, that was all there is to it. Why would I shoot that attorney? Well? There is no reason. There was a reason. To silence Mitsurugi Shin. He figured it out. Undefeated for 40 years, the most powerful prosecutor. Attorney Mitsurugi was not the one utilizing illegal methods. Prosecutor Karuma, it was you! Attorney, don't make me repeat the same thing again and again! In the court evidence is everything! This bullet will prove everything. The handgun used in the DL6 incident was originally submitted by the Prosecution at the trial between Attorney Mitsurugi and Prosecutor Karuma. Prosecutor Karuma compared the ballistics markings between the bullet found at the crime scene with the handgun, and found a match. This was used to prove the defendant's violation of firearm possession. This is the ballistic markings data from that time. Attorney Ayasato Chihiro had left it in the records. From here on I will try to reenact the situation 15 years ago. However, someone has disposed of the handgun from that time. So instead, I will use this bullet that was shot from the very same handgun. Of course, just like 15 years ago, they should be 100% identical, right? Your Honor, stop it. Cancel it immediately! Analysis in progress... Matching rate 0% Zero percent... Prosecutor Karuma, this is evidence that 100% proves your corruption. Reiji... 40 years of perfect wins, revealed to be fraudulent. In order to protect that secret, you killed Attorney Mitsurugi Shin. And... made many people suffer! That face of yours looks exactly like that guy's. Even though you know nothing. Inexperienced. You're just an inexperienced attorney. The reason you guys live peacefully everyday, dangling after a make-believe justice, do you understand? Because we prosecutors, without exception, put all the scum behind bars! Shit! Shit! Have you even realized? Scumbags ignore what they've done and can calmly say, "I'm innocent." They're all out there. That's why... we can't just sit here and let them get off! Shit! Shit. Shit... Fabrication? Concealment? What about it?! In order to defeat the criminals, I would do anything. Overlooking their crimes is unacceptable! That is our mission! Objection. Our mission is seeking the truth. Officers, quickly take him away. I will now pronounce the judgment for the defendent Mitsurugi Reiji. Not guilty. [Not Guilty] My mother was wrong, and by telling a lie Haine-san was wrongly accused and a lot of people were hurt. That's not true. Your mother was precisely conveying my father's words. The one who lied was my father's spirit. The last thing he saw was the figure of his son holding a gun. That's why I think he told a lie in order to protect his son. I'd like to defend Haine-san until the end. You've helped me, Naruhodo. That's only natural. Eh? Hmm? What's up? There is still one case that hasn't been resolved. What? What? The classroom trial. The one who stole the lunch money, who was it! Oh... That matter, isn't it all right already? I didn't mean for Naruhodo to get blamed. I bought a plastic model for 4000 yen and I was 200 yen short. Huh? Eh? Aaaaah! What do you mean "Ah!?" It was you! Huh... I guess it was me? Are you serious? I became an attorney because I was grateful to you guys! How do you think I feel? I don't really know your situation. But it was 15 years ago, right? I guess it's passed the statute of limitations? I'm pissed. When's the statute of limitations on friendship, you bastard! Narimiya Hiroki as Naruhodo Ryuichi Saito Takumi as Mitsurugi Reiji Kiritani Mirei as Ayasato Mayoi Nakao Akiyoshi as Yahari Masashi Daito Shunsuke as Itonokogiri Keisuke Emoto Akira as Your Honor Tanimura Mitsuki as Oosawagi Natsumi Hira Takehiro as Mitsurugi Shin Sasai Eisuke as Namakura Yukio Ayukawa Makoto as Konaka Masaru Dan Rei as Ayasato Chihiro Ishibashi Ryo as Karuma Go Kohinata Fumiyo as Haine Kotaro Yo Kimiko as Ayasato Maiko [Ninja Nanja Bun] Objection! Then... how do you explain this, Defense? Ah! You... That's dirty! What is that? Ninja Nanja's red guitar! My methods don't violate the law, but seem to have violated your mind. Do you have a problem with that? Objection!
