Mine first. Oh, you bought her a gift, Mitchie. How sweet of you. Of course, I did, I mean, she is the only sweet bride in a city filled with bridezillas. Aw, it's a gift certificate to get my wedding dress in preserved packaging when the wedding's over. Thank you, Mitchie. That is so sweet of you. You're welcome. -What a great idea. -Okay. Sit back down. -Okay. -I don't do sloppy sentiments. Okay, and these are from us. Uh, do I really wanna open these in front of all these other ladies? -I don't know. Do you? -Mm-mm. I'll save 'em for later. Thank you. Your dad sent it, said your mom gave it to him before she passed. Wanted him to wait until your bridal shower for you to have it. Oh, Danielle... Oh, my gosh, it's gorgeous! We used to talk about my wedding when I was little. What I would wear, when it would take place... And now, even though she won't be here, the one thing I do know for sure is that... she would be so happy to know that I'm surrounded by such a wonderful family on my big day. So, thank you. Thank you all for being here for me. Girl, we love you. I love you. -It's beautiful. -Oh, my gosh. -I'll see you tonight. -I cannot wait. Hello, hello. Nice. Fill it up, fill it up, fill it up. -Hey, mom. Hi, hello. -He's here. Antoinette's here. -How are you? -Hi, good to see you. -Good to see you too. -Hi, sweetheart. -Thank you very much. -Mwah. Hello. Hey, baby. -Hi. -Hi. -Mm. -Good. Fine. -Okay. -How'd we do? I'd say we cleaned up all right. Oh, yeah, the bridge-club ladies did very well by Miss Amber. Nice. Anything, uh, sexy in there for me? Oh, don't you worry. We got you covered, though. But you're gonna wanna open those when you get home because we would've been banned from the bridal shower if she'd opened Taryn's gift out here. -Sounds perfect. -Uh, no. I don't understand why you couldn't have waited until whatever little bachelorette thing you're having tonight to bring that kind of gift. Oh, no, Margot. We couldn't. I mean, there is certainly no room to carry a gift in the dress I'm wearing tonight. And we'll be picking you up at 7 p.m. sharp, Ms. Clarke. So don't be late. -I won't, I won't. -Come here. -Smile. -I'll see you tonight. -You don't even know, girl. -Bye. Oh. Mm. Okay. So... What are the festivities this evening? Uh, no idea. The girls wouldn't tell me. Okay, it doesn't matter, just you girls behave yourself, hm? I will. I give you bride's word. It's not the bride that I'm worried about. -Got everything? -Yeah, I do. Okay. -Come on. -Yeah. Bye. -Where're you going? Round two. - Stop it. Wow. What you thinkin' about? Uh, how are we gonna thank the girls for those gifts? -Owen? -Yeah. You haven't thought about Meagan at all this week. -Not once. -Babe. Meagan and I were never engaged. -Yeah, but you got her a ring. -I got her a ring. -But I never gave it to her. -You didn't have a chance to or? Um, yeah, I, I did have a chance to give it to her, but... I didn't. Things with Meagan were always just so complicated. I loved her, but not enough to put a ring on it. And not nearly as much as I love you. And not at all the same way as I love you. What we have is... so different. -It's much deeper. -Yeah. You and I have been through a lot the last couple of years. You know, with your mom passing and my whole thing with Meagan. You think I'd be here right now dying to marry you if I wasn't over the moon in love with you? Over the moon in love with you. -Seriously? -I know. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I love you. -You good? -Mm-hmm. Yeah. Should be 300. Uh-oh. Looks like someone's about to rage tonight. Please. You know the closest thing I ever get to raging is one shot of tequila and a lemon chaser. Well, you might as well start right now. No, thank you. Why don't you guys go out? Do something fun tonight. You do card night every week. This isn't anything special. Trust me, I know, but Owen wants to stay home tonight. In case you ladies get a little too sloshed, you got a sober driver to pick you all up. Yeah, your one beer for the evening. -Whoo! -What's up, bitches? Oh, wow. Look at that dress! I love it! Come here! Yes. Get it. -Yeah. -Oh, stop that! Let's put the sash on. Okay. And then we're gonna... - Hey, hey. -Okay. We-we have to go because Philip's waiting outside for us. -Okay. -Yes, you ready? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't I, uh, get a hug too? Or at least a "Hell, no"? I made that mistake one too many times in my twenties. Let's just stand back, soldier. -There. Are you ready? -I'm ready. -Okay, let's go. -Okay. -We'll, we'll bring her back... -I love you so much.

I mean, Margot's throwing you the classiest royal wedding any little princess can ask for, okay? You needed some fun for your bachelorette, okay? -Mm-hmm. -Just saying. And, look, the girls are having the time of their life too. Okay, fine. It actually has been a ton of fun. -Yeah. -You're welcome. -More champ. -No, no, no. I've already had way more than I should. Uh-uh-uh. It's goin' right through me. So I will be right back. Okay, well, then, when you come back, you'll get more. -We killed this party. -I'm so proud of us. Yes.

How embarrassing. No, it's fine. Plus, you know, I kinda thought you were adorable. I've never seen a bride blush so much. Okay. I was a little taken aback by the show. -It was obviously a surprise. -Oh, that's what our boss said. "Go in and surprise the blonde strapped to the chair." You know, and since I kinda have a thing for blondes, I called dibs on the bride-to-be. But don't worry, I always mind my manners around a woman with a wedding band. I'm Hunter. Amber. And admittedly, bachelorette party strippers are a little out of my comfort zone. -I'm the boring one. -Well... Soon to be Mrs. Mathison, I don't find you boring at all. Your name is on the, uh, "Kiss The Miss Goodbye" poster thing. Oh, yeah, right. Oh, congratulations, by the way. So, when's the big day? Um, next Saturday, actually. Wow. So soon. -Everything in order? -Ah, just about. Yeah, I mean, I still have to pick up my altered dress and then we have the rehearsal, but, yeah. Yeah, it's all coming together. -Well, what's your fiance do? -He is... Thank you. Uh, a project manager at a tech and media firm, specializing in the entertainment industry. Ooh. What kind of entertainment, may I ask, huh? Not that kind. And what do you do? Uh, I actually run this place. You own this place? Well, partly. But someday it will be mine. -You dance? -I do. Yeah. Yeah, I grew up dancing. But now I teach and choreograph. Actually, my, my bridesmaid, Taryn is also a choreographer here too. Very nice. That's another thing we have in common. Mm-hmm. No, no. I don't, I don't do that kind of dance. You know, I, I may have just a bit of experience beyond the exotic circle. -Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. -Oh, yeah. Well, you're just gonna have to get out there and prove it. What are you doing? Come, dance. -Okay. All right, all right. -Come on. ♪ I can't hide but I am trapped ♪ ♪ Underneath the stars ♪ ♪ Am I crazy? ♪ ♪ So crazy I could lose it all ♪ ♪ Are you worth the fall? ♪ ♪ I could be the first one to tell you that it's bad ♪ ♪ But in the best way a girl could ever have it all ♪ ♪ Are you worth the fall? ♪ - Margot. Hi. -No wonder I wasn't invited. Ah, it's so lovely of you to join us. -You are looking gorgeous. -Thank you, Taryn. This is not a good look, Amber. -Can I get you a drink or-- -No, I'm fine. Could I have a minute, please? Of course. All the time you need. Right here in your studio, where just anybody in town, the people that know us could walk by and see what's going on here? It's, it's all harmless fun. These guys are actually really nice. -Actually. -I'm sure they are. You must be the groom's hot older sister. -Hey. I'm Benji. -Hi. Ma'am, this is Amber's big night and we were just having a little bit of fun. Is that what you call it? Well, this young lady is marrying my son in a week. So I would suggest that you undrape yourself from around her neck. Thank you. This is all my fault. Do not blame Amber at all. Like, she just didn't know anything about it, it's all-- I'm a 100% not surprised this is your idea, Taryn. Guys, let's just, let's just call it a night, okay? Good idea. Oh. We're calling that the evening. Okay? That's the evening. Now, everybody? Let's... Gentlemen, thank you so much for your efforts. I'm sure you're wonderful, why don't we find our clothes and our helmet? Okay, nice meeting you. Bye, gentlemen. Everybody, thanks for coming. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. See you ladies Monday. Behave. -Looking forward to it. -Can't wait. Oh, God. Now what? Ugh... -Hey, Margot. Your phone. -Oh. -Oh, thank you. -Oh, my God! -What happened? -I don't know. Looks like something ripped right through the damn thing. Maybe you got a nail in it? Does that look like a nail tear to you? Uh, guess not. Well, hey. Pop your trunk. I'll, I'll change it for you. You know how to change a tire? Hunter. -Hi. - Geez. -Car trouble? -What... What are you still doing here? My Lyft was cancelled. Why didn't you leave with the other dancers? They live east. I'm west. Here, let me help you with this. No, no, no. We've got it, young man. We're fine. No, really. I insist. -Is everything okay? -Yeah. Margot got a flat. And Hunter stayed to help. -Aw, how sweet! -And sexy too. Thank you, Hunter. Of course. Anything for the blushing bride. -Hi. -Hey, you. -Did you have fun tonight? Mm. -Mm. -I did. -Yeah? How was your night? It was great. Kicked everyone's ass in blackjack. Dad was a sore loser. Pretty usual. So what'd you guys do? Uh, it was actually at the studio. -Yeah? -Yeah. Danielle and Taryn hired these dancers who showed up unannounced and then your mother showed up unannounced. I guess Mitchie told her where we were. It was a whole to-do after that. What do you mean dancers? Why, isn't half your bridal party made up of professional dancers? No, like, male dancers. -You mean, like, exotic dancers? -Yeah. Were any of them as sexy as me? -No. -No? Mm-mm. -Any of them have my moves? -Okay. -Were they able to do, uh, this? -Okay. -Owen, stop. -Were they able to do this? -I'm so tired. That's enough. -Tired from what? Getting lap dances all night? Is that why? Let me go over last week. And five, six, seven, eight... Good morning. Hunter! Uh, did you forget something or... Nope, just here to sign up for dance class. You, you wanna sign up for dance? I thought you already trained. Uh, I mean, I already know how to dance like that. -Not like that. -You wanna take my ballet class? Yeah. Guys like you don't really take ballet, especially, intermediate. Guys like me? Wait, you mean, like, strippers? No. No, I mean, like, guys with your build. Okay, I really don't think you should discriminate against a willing-to-pay student simply because he lifts weights. Fine. Um, okay. So fill these out and sign the bottom. You can have a seat over there and my next class starts in about ten minutes. -Thanks. -Okay. All right! Great job, everybody. Awesome. Okay, I will see you all next week. Oh, he's back. Are you here to sign up for some dance classes or just see me? I'm gonna try Amber's ballet class. Really, I would've thought for sure you were more of a hip-hop kind of guy, especially with your background. Well, I'm actually trained in jazz, hip-hop, salsa, ballroom, you name it. Is that so? Well, then, I really don't know whether to be jealous or flattered. Why would you be either? Well, jealous because Amber gets to see you in her class every day or flattered because in a last-ditch effort to get closer to me, you signed up to her classes instead. I guess we'll just see which one lands first. Believe it or not, that's how she flirts. She just can't help herself. Well, then, you'll just have to help me show her that I have more to offer than putting out fires. All right. Let's get you changed. Come on, fearless fireman. Very nice. Hm. Lengthen your torso just a little bit. Shoulders up, just a touch. So you have had some ballet. Ah, just a little beginner's class a really long time ago. Hm, well, you still need to strengthen your core, so just pull a little harder at the hips? Okay? Well, plie. And passe. Okay. Now watch yourself. Plie. And passe. Thank you. Oh, sorry. Not bad, show-off. All right, let's move on. Oh, hey there. I saw you out there on the floor. Not bad, Mr. McConnell. -Well, thank you, Miss... -Belle. Like, like a wedding bell? I mean, I wouldn't know, I haven't had a relationship longer than three months, like, ever. -No? Why not? -Well, 'cause all men are evil. I mean, no offense. Well, well, you think I'm evil? I think you have the potential. Oh, that's right. Amber told me this is how you flirt. Oh, no. I mean, if I was flirting... you would know. Noted. Well, I will see you around. Ms. Belle Of The Ballroom. See ya. Hey, uh, can you hand me my wedding book? Uh, sure. Where did you put it? -Mm. I don't know. -I'm not seeing it. Uh, I must've left it at home. This morning was a blur. Oh, girl. This whole weekend was a blur. I know. Okay, I will see you around 5:00 at my place? -Yes. I can't wait to see it! -Yeah. Oh. I give to you the beautiful future Mrs. Mathison. Oh, you look gorgeous! Absolutely flawless, love. Uh, kudos, Mitchie. Do you like it? I do. It's lovely. Excuse me. -Oh, uh... Go, go, go, go. -I got this. Babe. Hey. Hey. I bet she's looking down on how beautiful you are right now. And she'll be there on your wedding day too. I know. I just... I just wish I could hear her voice. Oh, well, she'd totally be like... "Amber, you have never been more beautiful than in this moment right now. But what are we gonna do with this hair sitch?" What about your dad? When does he get into town? On Wednesday for the rehearsal, hopefully. That's if he can get away from work that long. Well, good, because you have plenty of people who are going to take really good care of you until he gets here. Thanks, Dan. Yeah. -Uh, uh-oh, we're stuck. -Oh. Oh, my God. -Okay, okay. -I can't. -Go ahead and get it out. -Oh, just turn around. This dress does not wanna get off you. Oh. Hey. Ah, if I give this back to you, you're not gonna lose it again, are you? Uh... Where did you even find where I live? Oh. "Name, address..." - And "Number." Right. -Boom. Well, thank you so much. I would've been lost without it. It has everything in here. My wedding ideas, RSVPs, their addresses. No, I know, I looked through the whole thing. -Um... - I'm kidding. -Weddings terrify me. -Why? Do you know how many crazy brides-to-be I've encountered? -What makes you think I'm crazy? - Oh, no. To the contrary, I think you're exceptional. Yeah, well, thank you. That's nice. Um, I will see you in class tomorrow? I wouldn't miss it. Okay, then. Goodnight. Who was that? Um, I dropped our wedding book at the studio and one of my students found it and brought it back to me. Lucky. That was nice of them. -You ready to eat? -Mm-hmm. Evenin', ladies. I didn't see you in there. I would've noticed you. Well, I didn't see you in there either. My name's Sherry, but you can call me Baby. What's your name? Jenny. Wanna grab a nightcap, Jenny? I've got a whole lotta dollar bills burning a hole in my pocket right now. Okay, sure. Goodnight. Hi. I still owed you for the classes. Well, thank you. But, uh, how many of those came from your pants? None of them. Thank you very much. Well, then, I'll take it. Uh, what's this? Just a little wedding gift for you. Oh. I have a friend who used it in his wedding. Took a bunch of photos of him and his girlfriend from their computers and then displayed it at the front table at the reception, you know... Maybe you could do the same for your fiance. That's a great idea. Uh, that's really sweet of you, Hunter. Thank you. I also personally wanted to thank you for all the bank I made at your party the other night. Do you have lunch plans after class today? Um... Look, I, I think you're really sweet and all. Um, I just... I don't know how my fiance would feel about me lunching with the exotic dancer from my bachelorette party. -You know? -Yeah. Of course. No, I, I get it. I do. You know, I just... I, I kinda had a crush on your friend Taryn and I thought, I don't know, maybe I'd get some intel from you, you know... I just didn't wanna do it here, you know? Put you on the spot where you both work, but... It's all good. I, I understand. Uh, Hunter, wait. I would love to give you some intel on Taryn. I think you guys would be really cute together. Um, how about after class, you walk down to the bakery with me? You could help me try my cake. Yeah, I love cake. It'd be my pleasure. Great. So Taryn and I were taking classes at the dance studio on the east side where both of us lived at the time and I had just moved here. She said I was soft. She needed to toughen me up. So she dragged me to a pole-dancing class. It was actually a lot of fun. -Well, did it? -What? Toughen you up? I mean, can't you tell? Not bad. Anyway, I, I think she likes you, too. You should ask her out and see what happens. Who knows? Maybe she'll even ask you to be her date to my wedding. Well, if it means more of this lemon cake, then I'm in. You actually, uh, have a little lemon, um, here. Thanks. Anything for the blushing bride. Well, it's getting late. I really have to get home, so... Sure. I'll walk you to your car. Okay. -Hey. -Hey. Dinner's just about ready, okay? Okay, I'll be there in a minute. I just gotta check something real quick. Dinner's re-ready! Uh, okay. I'm coming. -You're eating like a rabbit. -Hm. -Not good? -No, it's great. Thank you. Hey, everything okay? You seem quiet. Yeah, um... I just... I didn't realize that Meagan and I were practically twins. What do you mean? I went on your laptop to get some photos for this digital collage I was gonna do for the reception and, um, I saw a folder that you have of her. What, am I in trouble for having old photos on an old computer? No, no, I just, I didn't realize that she and I look so much alike. Do you? I guess I hadn't really thought about it. Hey, I don't think you guys look that much alike. Okay, well, do we have anything else in common? What are you doing? Uh, well, she was in hospitality. You run a dance studio, so... You like vanilla bean, right? She was more of a pistachio girl. You love being home for the holidays, but she always liked going on getaways. So other than the fact you guys have blonde hair and brown eyes, I, I don't see any other similarities. And I don't see why you keep bringing her up. What does she have to do with you and me getting married? It has nothing to do with it, okay? I just wish you would've told me. Geez! Britt, you scared me. Sorry. Um, do you need anything before I go? Uh, no, I'm good. I'll just, uh, I'll lock up after you. Cool. Uh... big plans?

Thank you. -Here, I'll give you this. -I'll take it in the back. Yeah, just put it in the closet because things tend to have a way of disappearing around here. - Okay. -Okay. Just spill it. Who is he? -Who is who? -Oh, please. You've been a Cheshire cat all morning. -Who's the guy? - Oh, my God! -You have been. - Yeah. Tell us everything right now. Okay, well, I may or may not have had a visitor over last night. Mm. More, more, please. Tsk, are you sure you wanna know? -Is it Hunter? -Wait. Who are we talking about? He's this gorgeous-looking guy. Uh, who was the stripper at Amber's bachelorette party. -Oh, boy. -Uh, Taryn. What are you thinking? -This is a bad idea. -Why? Do you know how many single women he's with every night at his job? He's practically bathing in them. Yeah, and now he'll just be bathing in me. -Okay. -No, no, no, no. Fun to tip, not to date. Trashy. All right. And that's all I'm saying about it. He's kind of nice, but I agree. You should be careful around him, Tar. He's very on all the time. Oh, well, you don't have to worry about me, okay? I'll be careful. I'm a big girl. Oh, sorry. This is my dad. I'll be right back. -He's cute, but, like-- -He's super cute. He's not... Do you wanna get married? Or you're just gonna date for the rest of your life? Yeah, dad. No, no, it's totally fine. It's just gonna be a bunch of Owen's parents' rich friends, anyway. You're not gonna be missing anything. Okay, I'll see you Saturday. Love you too. Everything all right? Hunter. What are you doing here? Taryn texted me, said you guys were here. -I live just four streets down. -Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. We're just getting our hair done for tonight. Oh, the big rehearsal dinner? Taryn mentioned it. Oh, yeah. Uh, duh. Of course. Are-are you okay? You seem not yourself. It's just, it's my dad. He was supposed to be here for the rehearsal tonight, but now it looks like he's not gonna be here until the wedding. Uh, that, that's too bad. It's my fault. I shouldn't have had it so early. It was Margot's idea. -Soon to be mother-in-law I met? -Yeah. She does seem to like it to have it her way. Have you tried talking to her? Mm, she's not exactly the best listener. I could make her listen if you want. Hey, back in the chair, we have two hours and we have to get you changed. -Who's this? -Uh, this is Hunter. He's here to see Taryn. I'm gonna go grab her. -Tell her to wait a minute. -Okay. You the stripper? Of course, you are. So what are you really doing here, bud? I mean, you do realize she's engaged. Yeah, I'm, I'm here to see Taryn, not Amber. My ass you're here to see Taryn. I don't know what you're talking about. So what's your last name, lover boy? That's none of your damn business. Oh, I think it is. "Preston Hunter McCain." Good, now you know you're limited to what you can get away with around these girls. So now that that's out of the way, I know you're used to getting your way, but not today. I'm gonna need you to leave. We don't need anymore distractions. Bye. -I know. -Oh, it was so fun. It's always good to have a spa... It's gonna be good. -Well, hank you so much. -Thank you. I've got a hot date, so, uh, this girl's got to go. -Okay. -Bye! Have fun. Oh, wait. I forgot the dress. Ooh, okay. My Lyft's here, but would you mind just, uh... Here. Just, like, take my keys. I've got a spare set. And you can just lock up and bring it back to me tomorrow? -Good? Okay. - Good luck. Okay, well, you girls go on, I'll grab the dress and I'll just meet you at rehearsal. -Okay. Thanks, Mitchie. -Let's go. -Bye. -Be safe. Get in the cab. Get in the cab. Hey, pretty lady. Party's over, buddy. Go home. Hey, Coop, hi. Thanks for callin' me back. Yeah, I don't know about this guy. Bit of a creep. Do you think we could get a little bit of background information on him? Yeah. Sure. I just have to grab this dress and then I will, I'll text you his info. Okay. Bye. Hello? Hello? W-what are you, what are you doing? Stay back. Help! Help! Help! And then they exchange rings and there's the kiss. Nice. And then we all march out, two by two, starting with Taryn and Russ. Very nice. And then you two, very sweet. And we all applaud as the couple goes by. Where the hell is Mitchie? Who's that guy over there? Um, he's dating Taryn. And he's also taking classes at the studio. Cool. Um, why is he here? I honestly have no idea. -Excuse me. -Owen. Let me borrow you for a second. I, I can't believe you brought him here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I did not invite him. Okay? We talked about meeting up later, but I would never ask him to come here. I mean, I would never do that. Owen is already asking who he is. Geez, what am I supposed to say? Well, tell him that we're dating. I don't know. That is what I told him. But what if Margot recognizes him? Then what? -Well, then, good for Margot. -Guys, guys. You need to get out here. -Thanks. -Thank you very much. Where do I know you from? Uh, you look so familiar to me. I-I don't know. You're not in the world of, uh, investment banking, are you? Definitely not in this lifetime. No. -Hi, ladies. -Hi. Oh, hey. How's it going? So I guess everybody's met Hunter. Wait. So are you two a thing? -Yup. -No. Well... He's taking classes at the dance studio with us, so-- So, are you like a Muscle Month model or something? No, actually, I'm an exotic dancer. The pay is way better. What do you do? Pro-narcissist? -Oh! -That's pretty accurate. Close. Party promoter. Mostly clubs. Ah, very nice. Well, maybe you could come help me with my club sometime, eh? Wait, hold on. You're being serious about the whole exotic-dancer thing? -Yeah. -Wait. Oh, my God! You guys, this, this is amazing. Er... Owen. I-I need some proof. Are you wearin' a thong right now? Let me see your thong. Kids, come on, the food's getting cold. Food, now. Let's go. Come on. Are you kidding me right now? You know, can I talk to you for a minute? Just a minute? Yeah. Please tell me that guy is not one of the guys-- Yeah, he is one of the guys. I'm sorry. I was really tryin' to figure out a way to tell you. Why would Taryn invite him here? - She didn't. -What? -So he just showed up? -Owen, it's fine. -Taryn's taking care of it. -Yeah. -If she's asking him to leave. -She is. Yes. Let's just, let's go eat. Okay? I don't like the way he looks at you. No, there's something wrong. Owen, he's taking classes at the studio and he's just a little... direct in his friendliness. But he's harmless. Okay? Come on. Let's go. No. Okay, so I just, I don't wanna rock the boat or anything, you know, in case Margot or Mitchie remembers you. So could we just meet up in a little bit, you know, maybe later? Sure. Yeah. Wait, is that, is that blood on your neck? Are you okay? Yeah, no. I, uh, I nicked myself trimming. But, uh, anyway, I will, uh, I'll just hang outside until you guys finish up and then... -Awesome. Yeah. -Yeah. I'll-I'll text you later. All right. -Hey. -Yeah? -You okay? -Yeah. I'm just trying really hard not to be that guy right now. Did he, like, touch you or anything at that party? Well, he just, he gave me a silly little lap dance when they first came in, but he didn't really touch me. Okay? -It was more like he gyrated-- -Oh, okay, okay, okay. So this is the guy that gave you the, the lap dance and now he's taking classes with you at your studio. Owen, he's seeing Taryn. And furthermore, that lap dance was not like the ones at men's clubs. Okay? It was harmless, it lasted a minute. -We were all laughing. -Oh, you were all laughing. Why, why didn't you lead with that? That makes everything okay. Anything else you wanna tell me? 'Cause speak now or forever hold your peace. -Right? -Okay, yes. Fine. Fine. He was also the one who found our wedding book and stopped by the house the other evening. That guy was at our house? That was him? And you didn't tell me? Owen, there's nothing to tell because nothing happened. And you haven't been so great about informing me of everything in your life, either. Exhibit A, Meagan. Yeah, it's not the same thing as you sitting across from me at our dinner table, looking me in the eyes, telling me about your day and conveniently leaving out all these chance encounters that you have with this guy. And you call that nothing. What has gotten into you, seriously? Owen, wait. Just, please, stop. I need a minute, please. Hey. Hey. Amber, what's going on? ♪ We're gonna have to change our dresses ♪ ♪ We're goin' out dancin' ♪ ♪ We've gotta get our bodies groovin' ♪ Hey, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine. -Yeah? -I mean, I'm just... I'm a little worried about Mitchie. -Has anyone heard from her? -Yeah. No. And I reached out to her, like, five times. Haven't heard a thing. I'm hoping she's all right-- Well, damn. Come on, it's your day. We gotta dance, come on! She's not in the mood, okay? Just let her, let her-- Oh, shoot! Ethan, I said I'm not in the mood-- -I wanna dance. Come on... -I just... Hey, get your hands off her! Are you okay? Hunter! What is wrong with you? What are you still doing here, Hunter? I'll kick your ass, stripper boy. -Stop it, Ethan. -I'm sorry. Who are you? Okay, we're gonna have to call the police, young man. I was just trying... Are you okay? Yeah. Hunter, I'm fine! Who are you? Why are you so concerned about her well-being? Look, I know what kind of guys you and your friends here are like. Educated, rich, courteous career boys in public. Then you cheat behind your fiancee's back every chance you get. Hunter, you are way out of line. -You need to leave right now! -It's okay, baby. It's okay. Hey, hey, hey. What's your deal? Seriously, you show up here uninvited and now you're starting fights with my family? Do you, do you know where you are right now? You're at our wedding rehearsal. This is my fiancee. -Do we have a problem? -No, Owen. Stan, just call the police right now. It's-it's okay. I'll leave. Thank you. Hey, kid. Here's your tip. Loser. Hey, thank you. I love you, but you're not helping. -Are you okay? - Why did you do that? Because he's had too much to drink. Hey. Do you still think he doesn't like you? You can't be so naive. Jenny. Hey. It's Hunter from the other night. Yeah. No... Yeah, I'm sorry things got a little rough. But we were having fun, though, weren't we? Yeah, no. I get... Hey, look, I'm sorry to call so late, but I have a friend, a, a female friend who's about to get into a really bad marriage soon. And I was hoping that you might be able to do me a favor. I mean, I'd be happy to pay you. I could make that work. Okay. Send for her right now. Hi. Can I help you? -Hi. Are you Amber? -I am. Your fiance, Owen, he's not home right now, right? Uh, no. No, he's at work right now. Why? Okay, well, um, you see... He's cheating on you with me and I really thought you should know because he told me you're getting married. And I don't think that's a good idea. I swear, I didn't realize he was engaged at first. -I just-- -Um... What are you even talking about? How do you know Owen? We... We met at a conference for his firm. Okay. When was this? Back in April. Um, Owen wasn't at a work conference in April. And he's never even looked at another woman in the year since I've known him. So why don't you tell me why you're lying to me? Look, I just... Okay, someone paid me to come here and try and out your husband. I don't really know the guy, okay? Okay. Who paid you? Just, please, don't tell anyone I admitted anything to you. The guy is really weird, I have to go right now. Okay? Was his name Hunter? Hello? Was his name Hunter? Hey... What did I do? Oh. It was just a little fight. I'm sorry. No, Owen. I am so sorry. You were right about everything. I just... I was completely oblivious to it. Can't help that you're just so sweet to everyone. You wanna know the moment that I fell in love with you? This is the exact moment that I knew I was gonna spend the rest of my life with you. It was our second date, we were walking back to your car from the coffee shop and saw that sweet old lady struggling to get those groceries up the steps, and you just took my hand and you're, like, whoop! And you rushed right to help her. From that moment, I knew I was trapped. And then you rushed ahead to open the door for us. -Oh. -Like you always do. That's why we make such a good team. Yeah. Um, I think Hunter sent a girl to our house today and paid her to claim that she was having an affair with you. -What? -No. No, it's okay. I, I didn't even entertain the idea for a second. I knew instantly that you wouldn't do anything like that. I'm sorry I was harsh on you about Meagan and that my insecurity made me so insensitive to your loss. Thank you. And I'm sorry I snapped. We can just chalk it up to pre-wedding jitters, huh? We've all been on edge this week. So what now? I mean, now I'm just gonna make you my wife. -I like that. -I'm puttin' a ring on it. Up, down, turn around, hit and... Nothing beats a good ballet wedding march. Hunter, what are you doing here? I, I, I really think you should go. Oh... Sorry? I just... brought you a bridal gift. Hunter, did you... Did you pay some girl to come by my house and try and convince me that my fiance's a cheater? Uh, what are you talking about? That's absurd. I mean, why would I do something like that? I mean... maybe you should be asking your fiance why some woman is showing up at your house claiming that he cheated with her. Hunter, what do you want from me? Right now I just want you to open the gift. No, I, I-I-I don't wanna open the gift right now, okay? Now, can you just, please, leave? I'll leave, but just as soon as you open the gift. Hunter, what is wrong with you? I'm engaged! Okay, okay, look, I didn't mean to start a fight between you and your fiance the other night, but if he's cheating on you too, I, I really don't think that he has a right to be upset about our relationship. What... W-w-we don't have a relationship, okay? I... -I, I barely even know you. -Yes, yes. But you know that what we have is more than that, Amber. I mean, ever since the first time we met, there's been sparks. You were a stripper at my bachelorette party, okay? That... That-that was it! You can't deny you find me sexy. -Maybe if we just kissed-- -Hunter, stop! Just get away! -Please, just stop-- -Damn it, Amber! Why are you being such a bitch again? Okay. Amber... I want you to listen very carefully when I tell you this. You... will not be married to him. Do you understand? Hunter, just... Taryn! Taryn! -Get away from me. -Hey! Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing, asshole? This has nothing to do with you. Leave! Right now! Leave! Hope you enjoy your gift. Leave. What was that? I-I don't know. I don't know. Oh, my God, uh.. Uh, when did this happen? It was just the night before last. Some security guard was making his rounds and he found her body just outside of the salon front. Gate was locked and she was still inside. Oh, my God, this must've happened right after we left the other night. Do they know who did it? Some homeless thief. They found her blood on his jacket, he had her purse. And they also said that they found his prints on the weapon. I just can't believe it. Poor Mitchie. Of all the times for this to happen, two days before the wedding-- -Mom, not the time. -I know, it's just-- Honestly, we should consider postponing the wedding. It just doesn't seem right right now. Look, son, if you felt the need to postpone, we would be perfectly fine with that. -What do you wanna do? - Listen, kids. You don't have to decide right now, okay? Just take the night and think about it. Okay? -Thank you. -Okay. We'll think about it. So what do you think, hm? Should we hold off on the ceremony? With Mitchie's death and this psycho stripper handing out negligee, it seems a little inappropriate, no? Hey, you want to know what's weird? It's that Hunter showed up with a few specks of blood on his neck. Like, the other night at the rehearsal dinner. You think he got it from his scuff with Ethan? No, it was before the scuff. I mean, it was right when he showed up. -Are you sure it was blood? -Yeah. I mean, he said he nicked it during trimming. But, I mean, I did not see a cut anywhere. Where's this guy from? Oh, he's from this place called Naughty Boyz, I think. -With a Z. -What are you doing? It's disconnected. Come on. We're going down there. ♪ Whispers in my ear ♪ ♪ Voices inside my head ♪ -Hey. IDs? -I got this one. We're looking for the owner. Is that you? No. She only works on Mondays and Tuesdays. Oh, that's too bad. Well, could we just maybe get that information from you? 'Cause we have this complaint from one of your dancers. He's been, well, naughty. Yeah, I-I'm not at l-liberty to give out that information, so... Well, are you sure? 'Cause we could just really-- Hey! Hey! Lady! Get down from there. Should we just... -Yeah, let's just go. -Okay. Well, I don't think we'll be getting any incriminating information from anybody. Is that Benji? Benji. Benji. Benji. Hi! Benji! -Benji! Benji! -Do you remembe... Wh... -Hi, guys. -Freeze! For real though, you ladies can't be back here. Unless you wanna let me frisk you first. Um, Benji, hey. -Do you, uh, remember me? -Oh, yeah. Hey! I, uh, danced at your bachelorette party. You've got all the hot dancer friends. Yeah, yeah, that's me. Um... Is... Hunter isn't working here tonight, is he? Hunter doesn't actually work here. What do you mean, he doesn't work here? Yeah, no, he hasn't worked here in, what, last year and a half. Right? No, no, not since he went out of his damn mind. -Um, out of his mind? -What? -What do you mean? -His girlfriend was killed. -It was sad. -Yeah, and then he lost it. He kept losin' his temper here at work partying too hard with the ladies, gettin' in fights with the other dancers. H-hold on, if, if he doesn't work here, how did he get hired for my bachelorette? Well, our other guy, Boone, was supposed to work, but got his knee busted by some thug the night before and ended up in the hospital. We had a full house and Hunter was texting me because he needed to make some cash. So I invited him to headline at your bachelorette party. He's usually a big hit with the ladies. Do you know where he works now? -Okay. Hey. -Awesome. -Thanks, guys. -Okay. -Oh, my God. It's Preston. -Owen. This son of a bitch's name is Preston, it's not Hunter. This is the guy that Meagan was engaged to before she met me. Wait, this is the Meagan... -Your ex who died. - Yeah, my ex. Hold on, wait, if Meagan was broken up with him when you met her, why is he still carrying a weird grudge? I don't know, 'cause technically they weren't broken up before we got together. What? You were seeing her while she was still engaged to him? Look, he hit her, she bailed. She was done with him. Apparently, he doesn't see it that way, though. I met her, like, a week after this happened. And he was hitting her up so much, he was texting her, he was calling her, he, he even showed up at her house. I-I guess I-I never saw him in person, but I know from a photo that she showed me that this is the guy. Wait, but how did he even know about this whole bachelorette party thing? I mean, he's just been following you for the past year? It's gotta be my mom, right? She's been... She's been blasting our, our engagement announcement on social media for, like, the last three months. Yeah, no, but t-that still does not explain how he got to me. I know. I mean, the whole reason why I even knew about Naughty Boyz for the party was because there was a flyer in the mail at the studio. I mean, he obviously is the one who put it there. If that's the case, he really is crazy. -Yeah, like, next-level crazy. -Yeah. We need to call the police. Come on. We're saying at my parents' tonight. The house isn't safe. And you said his last name is... -McConnell? -McCain. I went through some old emails of Meagan's. -It's definitely McCain. -Okay. Well, besides him showing up unannounced and picking a fight with your friends at your rehearsal and this inappropriate crush he seems to have on your fiancee, what's he done to make you think he's dangerous? This is the same guy that was dating my ex and smacking her around a few weeks before she mysteriously died in a car accident. Police brought a mechanic in to look into foul play, but there wasn't enough evidence, so everyone just kind of forgot about it. Now, after all this, I can't help but think he might've had something to do with her death. Your deceased ex's name? Meagan Tucker. She, uh, died March 23rd last year. And now you think he's stalkin' the two of you? He ever make any direct threats? Um, yeah, yeah, he did say that under no circumstances would he allow us to get married. Yeah, and he also hired somebody to come to our house and tell my fiancee that I was cheating on her. Ma'am, he was hired to be an exotic dancer at your party, yes? You know, why don't you take a further look into the death of our wedding planner, Mitchie Stone, okay? Our friend said that she saw specks of blood on Hunter's neck the same night that she was killed. Didn't they already apprehend some vagrant for that murder? Yeah, yeah, but they did not find my wedding dress in his possession, so I'm not so sure your department has their facts totally in sync. Uh, Detective Allen? Allen, my husband and I contribute a great deal of funding to programs that help keep this city safe. And Commissioner Mills is a, a close personal friend of ours and I would recommend that you take my son and daughter-in-law's advice and start looking into this stalker situation as soon as possible. Now, if you don't have any further questions, it is getting awfully late. Well, I will try to locate Mr. McCain and bring him in for some questioning. -Thank you, detective. -Thank you. -Have a good night. -You too. Thanks, mom. Owen? Owen? Owen? Owen! I think we'd like to not have our wedding at the original venue, if that's okay. We're still a bit spooked over this whole thing and, uh, I don't think we'll enjoy ourselves. Well, of course, I understand, honey. What would you like to do then? Well, we still wanna get married, uh... We were just wondering if we could maybe have a little ceremony over at your other place in the hills? Oh! Well, if that's the case, why don't you do it here then? Well, I know that place isn't as big as this one and it won't fit as many people, but it is in a gated neighborhood and... I don't know, we just feel like we would be safer there. We could maybe cut down the guest list. And if it's okay with you and dad, we would like to lay low there for a while just till this whole thing kind of blows over, you know? Hunter, Preston, whatever this guy's name is, doesn't know where this place is, so, you know, he can't get to Amber. At least until the police figure out more. -Well, that makes sense. -Look at this. Look what came in the mail today. What the heck is this? What is it? What? It's a wedding invitation. -What? - Look at this. Hello? No, Tammy. That's a-a hoax invitation. -That's not real. -Tammy got it too? No, somebody is, is harassing Amber. She got one too. And so I just packed up my stuff and I called the crew and so Russ and Danielle and Ethan are just getting ready as well. -What? -Well... It looks like we're gonna be doing damage control on this invite thing for the rest of the day because it went out to the entire invitation list. So why don't you guys just go out to the country house and we'll get Tim to take down the decorations and the chairs and the lights and you guys can figure out what you wanna do with all this stuff and dad and I will go to the ballroom and come over later with the flower arrangements, okay? -Thanks, mom. -Thank you. -Of course. -I'm sorry. -Oh, here's Antoinette. -Oh. Hi, honey. No... This is our exact invitation. Look at this, it's the exact same invitation that we had. -I know, I was freaking out. -Only he put his name over mine. -What is this man planning? -I don't know. But we're not staying around here long enough to find out. So let's go. Come on. What's with the second garment bag? Oh, this? I don't know, what is this? Is that the other dress I liked? I hope so. That's what Taryn said. -Thank you. -Yeah? -Yeah. Yeah, you did. -I did good? Good. Okay, okay, lovebirds. Are you guys ready to get to work or what? 'Cause the decorators are here. -Let's do this. -Let's do it. My gosh, this place! It's amazing! I mean, look-look at this! Yes. Thank you, sir. Uh! Wow! -Oh! -Um... -It's beautiful! -Will this do? Yes! Okay, guys, there are a lot of chairs and a ton of lights, so we should probably get started. Just saying. -Just saying! -Aah! Oh! Hey! Well... -Here's to a smooth wedding... -Yes. From here on out. - Cheers. -Salud. Um, were we expecting anybody this early? No. Your parents aren't coming until later tonight, right? Yeah, Ethan works late, he said he's not coming until after. Same with Russ and Danielle. -I'll check it out. Stay here. -Okay. Should we check it out? Oh, yeah. We're going. Someone here? -Who do you think it is? -I don't know. -Hello? - Owen, don't. Hello. Ooh! Whoo! -Well, who the hell are you? -Bea, from the cake bakery. Oh, my God! Ms. Mathison called. She asked me to bring the cake by. Sorry, I went to the front and nobody was answering, but the flower ladies let me through the gate as they were leaving. Ugh. And I couldn't wait, it's really heavy. Sorry. Congratulations. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thanks. Bye. -Oh, my God! -Phew! - Nice! -Told you I was good. But you do know that you were stripes, right? Ah. It was a good shot. -Hello? - Hey, it's me. Danielle and Russ are just behind me. -Can you let us in? -Come on in. Cavalry's here. Ooh. What's your shot? Hey! You guys on your way? Huh. Sadly, no. Not yet. You're not gonna believe this, but my car was stolen a little while ago. -What? -Yeah. Uh, it's just gone. Right out of the driveway, Russ is on the phone with the police right now, but we're gonna be late. What the hell are you guys doing down there? They have, like, 20 bedrooms inside for that. What the hell are you doin' here, bro, in Danielle's car? I need to speak to Amber. This doesn't concern you. Oh, yeah, it does. And the cops. Yo, Owen. Owen, get down here. Owen! - I'm just gonna wait... -Okay, you know, no. Check it. -Watch. - Just sayin'... Oh-ho! That is a scratch. -Good one. -Guys, bad-bad news. -Danielle's car got stolen. -What? Yeah, they're gonna be late. No, Ethan's here now. He said they're right behind him. Guys, I mean, they could've just taken Russ' car instead. No, I just, I just talked to her a minute ago. She said they're still back at the house. -That's not right. -That's weird. Okay, that is definitely Danielle's car. -Ethan! -Owen, no. -Go back inside. -Let's just call the police! Ethan! -Ethan! Oh, my God! Ethan! -Owen! Oh, my God! Call the police! Call the police right now! Ethan! Ethan! Come on! Oh, my God! Call the police? My mistake. I thought someone called the fire department. Hunter, what are you doing? I'm just trying to keep you from making the biggest mistake of your life. Last time, I made the mistake of getting rid of Meagan. But I was angry, confused. This time, I know exactly who and what the problem is. And once he's out of the way, you and I can be together again. Hunter, please. Please, let-let's just talk about this, okay? Hunter, what did you do to Ethan? Ethan was gonna call the cops before I had a chance to talk to you, before I could take care of you. Oh! Get back. -Go get help right now. -No. No. -Owen. Owen! No! -Come on. Come on! Well, I still don't know what Meagan saw in a little bitch like you. -You killed her, didn't you? -No, I didn't kill her. The car killed her. I just put the old broken master cylinder where it needed to go to do its job. -No, I can't leave him! -Look. We aren't. We're gonna get in this car and plough Hunter's ass down. Damn it! Where are the keys? You're sick, man. -You need help. -An eye for an eye, Owen. You took Meagan from me, so I'm gonna take Amber from you. That's not how it works. No matter what you do to me, Amber's never gonna be with you. Get that through your head. She will if she has no other choice. Over my dead body, asshole. Okay. - Owen! Owen! -Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine, he's just out of it. Owen! We need to pull up the car and load him in. -I know, but we have to go-- -Looking for these, ladies? Come on! -What do we do now? -Uh... Come on! Come on! What do we do now? We have to get back to Owen. I don't know, just let me think for a second. Oh, my God! Let her go! -Oh! -Oh! Oh! Oh! No! No! T... Taryn... Taryn. Taryn. Taryn! -You made me do this! -You killed her! You made me do this! Amber! Amber? Amber. Just come out so we can please talk about all of this. We can figure a way out of this. Together. Come on, come on, come on. You know... I may be a piece of meat to most women... but I have feelings too, you know? And when I get treated like dirt, it hurts. But I really like you, Amber. I could even love you, maybe even more than Meagan. But you have to give me something in return. Hey. You okay? Where is he? Is he coming? Hey, Hunter, here's your something. -Are you okay? -Yeah. ♪ Here we go ♪ ♪ There's nothing wrong ♪ ♪ We'll give it a sunset come chance ♪ ♪ The more we get ♪ ♪ The more we want ♪ ♪ You know that is true at first glance ♪ Now we're married.
