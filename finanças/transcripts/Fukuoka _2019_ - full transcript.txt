Jae-moon. Do you want to travel with me? I know you're not sleeping. Get lost. You know Fukuoka in Japan? How about that? Such a nutjob. I'm not a nutjob. Speak to my face. Are you jailbaiting me? You friggin' little brat. I'm 21. Then why are you wearing a school uniform? It's pretty. Why are you doing this to me? I don't have money, I don't have anything. Go home. Nevermind, then. But you'll regret. Of course you can't fall asleep at night when you hit the sack in broad daylight. Did you hear something? What is this? Jin Ping Mei? This is why you're so messed up, you little brat. Well, you watch porn all the time. This is much better. I can even study Chinese characters. Do you still watch porn? Way to go for your age. Did you do that? Did you see a ghost? Gosh... Bro, do you know how Hae-hyo is doing? We haven't been in touch for more than 20 years. Okay. Really? Okay. Okay. Got it. What did you say a little while ago? Fukuoka? You like this kind of stuff? Jeong-eun Bookstore Why did you want to come to Japan with me? Let's see. Do you know how to speak Japanese? Nope. You don't? I don't either. Don't worry. I'll understand everything. Such a nutjob, this one. FUKUOKA Excuse me, how do I get here? (Japanese) Go straight, pass the crosswalk and walk a little to your left. Thank you. You said you didn't know Japanese. I said I would understand everything. Are you a ghost? We'll all become ghosts anyways. What took you so long? You made me wait for hours. Come on. It wasn't that long. I was going to go back to Seoul. The weather is so nice, isn't it? You're laughing? I paid for the flight, the taxi, the lodging, the udon... You're driving me nuts. Where did you get the key? There's no counter, nobody. It's convenient. It's so nice not having to meet face to face. This is called Airbnb. You don't know it, do you? I know what Airbnb is. But it feels nice to come out from the basement, doesn't it? Yeah, nice. Business isn't great anyways. You have no customers. I'm the only one. Who says business isn't great? Everything's done online. No way. How many people actually come into a secondhand bookstore these days? Me. Just me. I need to go to the bathroom. - We're here. - What's the apartment number? We're here. Here we go. Here? Where's the bathroom? I don't know. So refreshing. Almost pissed myself. We'll be spending some time together so let's mind our language. Jeez. A Yeah, yeah, sumimasen. Oh, nice. Oh, tatami room. Oh, nice. Don't come in. I don't know. I know you can't come in. How do you know? People who look like you just can't. What do I look like? Handsome. Gee, thanks. You're pretty too. Don't come in. Don't come out. Where are we going later anyways? I don't know. Don't snore. We're almost there. This way? Where are we going anyways? Is it here? It should be. I think it's this place. It's this one? It is. Is it? Hello. What's your name? So-dam. Wow, I didn't know you had such a big kid. What grade? I think you've mistaken something. He's just my neighbor. Really, the things that you do. You should age well, you bastard. I brought him here. That's enough. Why? I'm taking your side. You've gotten really old. Your hair greyed a lot. So this is how you live. You have a problem with the way I live? How do you live? I've come a long way. Give me a drink. What do you want? Milk? Milk, it is. Round the mountainside, I approach a deserted well by a paddy-field and stare into its depths. In the well, The moon is bright Clouds saunter The sky is spread out The azure wind blows And there dwells autumn. Japan's nice. You can smoke. Want me to tell you a love story? You don't go well with love. Porn suits you better. There were two really close college mates in a drama club 28 years ago. But these two guys liked the same girl in the drama club. Love triangles are such a cliché. No, I mean the two guys were going out with the same girl. So a threesome? Watch your mouth, you little brat. No, I mean the girl liked both guys. It's about to become a cliché again. It is a cliché. Let me tell it again. That's not it. The younger guy just butted in between the two. Go on. The older guy? The younger guy who butted in? What do you mean I butted in? We even had a three-party encounter. The girl really liked both guys. So what happened? She was told to choose one. And? She quit school and disappeared completely. Because of you two? Just because of that? That's why you haven't seen each other for twenty-something years? You guys are so... What's that? So small-minded. I wonder who the girl is. What was her name? Soon-yi. Hello. Why isn't he responding? Hae-hyo, aren't Japanese people polite? What's up with him? He's a deaf-mute. He can't speak. I think he can speak. What? He can speak, I think. He's been a regular customer for years, I should know. I think he can speak Korean. What? She's a nutjob. Don't mind her. Nutjob. This is nice. Didn't know there was a space like this. Get lost. The nutjob's gone somewhere and that man won't say anything. Let's drink. Just get lost, would you? Yes sir, I'll get lost. Thank you for all these years. I have been a mute till this day. Thank you for understanding. I apologize. This is the first time he's spoken. For real. This is really the first time he's spoken. He spoke in Korean. Wow, you're good. You, for ten years... How did you put up with the body language and stuff all these years? I promised myself not to speak for a decade. A decade, that's some doggedness. You guys didn't see each other for two decades. But why make such a promise? I know why you did. It's because of a woman, isn't it? I'll recite a poem. "Palace of Love" Yun Dong-ju, the poet. Right. My dear Soon-yi, when was it that you came into my palace? And when was it that I entered yours? Our palace was a palace of love, where ancient customs reigned. Dear Soon-yi, like a doe, close your crystalline eyes. I, like a lion, will groom my tangled mane. Our love was a mere deaf-mute. Youth! Before the heating flame of the sacred candle goes out, Dear Soon-yi, run out the front door. You know.. You come in to my life after 28 years and I don't know what you want from me. I haven't changed, so just get lost, would you? Yeah, you haven't changed at all. Yeah, I haven't changed. I haven't. You're still living in delusion. You think I came here because I wanted to see you? Then why did you come? I was possessed by a ghost. You're the ghost, you bastard. I'm the one possessed by a ghost. Got it? Yeah, you're living like a ghost. Now that you saw me living like this, feel at rest, drink up, and get lost. I know why you came to live here. This is so you. You know? What the hell do you know? You seem nice and ingenuous on the surface but in fact you're mean and very calculative. Right. I know why you're here. You've come to pick a fight, didn't you? Just leave. Get lost, you bastard. I looked into it, you know. You rummaged the student records in the administrative office on the day Soon-yi quit school. Yeah, so what. Soon-yi's from Fukuoka. So did you meet her? You've been here for 20 years. Then why do you live like that? Jeong-eun Bookstore. Jeong-eun Bookstore next to the underground parking lot in front of the university's main gate. The bookstore our Soon-yi went to everyday. What are you doing there? Did you meet Soon-yi? Jeez. Jae-moon, let me tell you something. The day before Soon-yi disappeared, she slept with me. You understand what that means? What are you talking about? She slept with me. I remember the exact date. What? She said just one thing that day. You know what she said? You crazy bastard. What did she say? What did she say? Dawn is breaking. You like this kind of stuff too? Yeah Why? You like it? It's just like the moon. Soon-yi used to like that. I've seen this somewhere. Do you sleep well these days? Yeah, I do. Good. You used to suffer from insomnia. How did you beat it? I never had insomnia. I just sleep well because I don't see you anymore. What? Don't act so innocent, you bastard. How could I have slept when you made drunk calls to me at three, four in the morning everyday? Why laugh? You make it sound like it's true. It's true, you shameless bastard. You're saying you didn't? You don't remember? Are you guys dating each other? Seems like it. What? I keep on seeing the steel tower, as if it's following me. Where's that tower? In the middle of Tenjin station. It's not following you. You just see it from everywhere here. Nothing to see. What are you doing? Nice. (Japanese) Hi. Three cups of coffee, please. You come here often? Sometimes. Smells nice. I really like this actress. The owner here is a cinephile and has a lot of posters. Doesn't look interesting. You just watch porn everyday. Still watch porn? Gosh... I don't watch porn. Thank you. What kind of person are you? I eat, sleep, shit, cry, laugh. Same with you. Same, huh? She seems to have supernatural skills, no? I thought I was a ghost. Well, I get confused too, though. Sometimes I feel like a ghost, at other times a human. It's as if she's acting in a play. Interesting. Do you want to? What? A play. A play? You think theater is easy? Bizarre. You guys are just as bizarre. What about us? Such a petty thing... Keeping it in mind for 20 years. 28 years to be exact. 28 years... And how would you know if it's a petty thing or not? Men these days aren't like that. Is that a compliment or an insult? The bathroom's that way. Hey, where are you going? Is she this quirky all the time? She's a nutjob. Don't mind her. We're real idiots. What do you mean? Whats all this because of one woman? This isn't life, back then and even now. What's up with you all of a sudden? You've been playing pure-hearted all alone for more than 20 years. What's up all of a sudden? I never said I was pure-hearted. Of course I've met other women. But it doesn't last long. Well, do you not sleep with other women? Why wouldn't I? Did I say I didn't? I do. But what's the use? I sleep with one, and I regret once more. Right. Do you even understand what I said? Of course I do. What do you know? What did I mean? Tell me. You can't forget the day you slept with Soon-yi. You dirty bastard. Gosh. That's so you. Quit it. Let's stop. It's the same with me. It was best with Soon-yi. My body is a corpse these days. Fuck... Why so much tears these days when I'm not even going through menopause? That isn't because of menopause. You always cried back in college too. No, I didn't. I cried? I did? You're like a kid in puberty, back then and even now. You're like a kid, you bastard. Are you okay? (Chinese) Are you Korean? Yes, I'm Korean. Do you understand Chinese? This is weird. I understand Korean too. Can I take a look at the book? That's Haruki's new book. Do you like Haruki's books? Yes. Do you know why I am crying here? I had a dream 2 years ago back in China. I saw this place in the dream. Here, this bench. I sat here and cried for a while in the dream. And then, by chance, I saw this place online. It was the same place I saw in my dream. So I bought a plane tickets and came here. Can I show you something too? Sure. Jin Ping Mei Do you know this book? How does a young woman like you read the most erotic classical novel in China? It was quite a novel. I see it's published in Korea. I didn't read this book. How do I say this... I was too shy to. So-dam, what are you doing there? I need to excuse myself. Goodbye. Miss! What's your name? So-dam. So-dam What are you two doing? Do you know Chinese, So-dam? No, I don't. Weren't you speaking in Chinese with that person? I believe. What? She can communicate with everything. What does that mean? Actually, I understood everything she said too. I did too. What's happening? Let's go. We've been too uptight, that's why. Hey, the building here is the oldest secondhand bookstore in Fukuoka. You want to go? You'll like it. Why would I do that after coming all the way here? I'm sick of books. It should be good. (Japanese) Hello. Hello. Is the owner here? I'm the owner. No, I mean the old man. Do you mean my grandfather? He passed away 2 years ago. Huh? But I met him a few days ago. People say they saw my grandfather. He must be unwilling to leave this world. He doesn't appear in front of me, though. So we meet again. Do you know me? I still have the doll you left here last time. One moment. Wasn't this your first visit to Japan? It's my first time. You came here in your uniform a year ago, didn't you? I remember you singing while stroking the doll's hair. Right there. Weird. It's not even a dream, is it? - Hae-hyo. - Yeah. That woman's pretty. There you go again, you crazy bastard. Mom. What's she doing? Yes dear. Mom. Yes dear. Mom, your hand smells nice. It's the smell from doing laundries. It's the smell of lathers. Mom. Irie Bookstore Do we look alike? I don't know. Maybe a little. I don't know. He's so ambiguous, isn't he? Hey, So-dam. What do you think of Jae-moon? You're really ambiguous. What do you want me to say? Forget it. Never mind. What was her name again? Soon-yi. So countrified. Is it? It's because she's from Fukuoka. Korean Japanese people gave names in the old way. I like the sound of it. It's pretty. Jae-moon? Can I ask you something? Let me ask you something. What? If you go back in time, How about Jae-moon, Soon-yi, and you date all together? The three of us? Yeah, why don't the three of you have a romantic relationship? A romantic relationship? Huh? What would it be like if you did? You think that makes sense? Let's just say it does. What would it be like? Do you think it would be better than now? I'd say there's nothing to lose. He spoke about me, didn't he? He indeed did. Yeah, yeah, we did. I told her not to believe what Jae-moon said. Satisfied? Yeah, good job. Ditto. I also told her not to believe you. Great, good job. But you're the one who started talking behind my back. What does that mean? What did I start? You did it to Soon-yi 28 years ago. Twenty... That? That I told Soonyi she shouldn't believe you? That one? I'm hungry. Let's eat something delicious. (Japanese) Welcome. Hello. Welcome. Hello. Help yourself. Would you like to sit here? Can we? Let's sit. We meet again. Yes, we meet again. What would you like? I'll order. Three shrimp tempura udons, please. What? Oh, would you like to sit here? Hey, what are you doing? I'm sorry. Butting in as always, huh. Help yourself. Thank you. Gosh, you eat so loud. Thank you. So loud, I can't eat with you. What took you so long? Come sit. I knew she'd be here. What are you doing? Come and eat. They're bloating. You two go ahead. We'll take it slow. Yeah? (Japanese) See you again. Let's go. Come on. What's up with her again? I don't know. Weird. What's weird? I did see her grandfather. I definitely talked with him a few days ago. I'm going to give up. Give up what? When did you ever not live like that? Where did she go? Huh? Where did she go? Weird. So weird. What do you think about those guys? (Japanese) They're funny. Kinda cute too. Right, they're like kids. They're over fifty, though. They wouldn't be angry because we disappeared all the sudden, right? They're probably drinking. Maybe fighting. Really? That bastard. Such a bastard. It's been 28 years and he hasn't changed a bit. Knows nothing but himself. I let go of my pride and come all the way here. Fine, you live like that. Live like that till the day you die. Speaking to yourself, huh. Go on. You're the same. What did I do? Where have you been? It looked like you two were having fun, so I left you to yourselves. But why are you here? What about Hae-hyo? Gone. He's gone. Don't want to see him. Never going to see him again. You're no good either. Why did you make me come here with you? Hmm... Now I think I know. What? You and Hae-hyo are the same. You're the same. How am I the same with that bastard? You two are the same. That's why Soon-yi liked both of you at the same time and left both of you at the same time. Because you're the same. At the same time... Same time, my ass. Soon-yi liked me. Gosh... You have no idea... Let's say she did. Careful, careful, careful! Let's go. We're here, almost here. Careful. Just a little, a little more will do. Jae-moon. Wake up. Wake up, will you? Let's go sleep at home. Whatever. Fine, just sleep. Mom. Mom. What? Mom. Mom. What's the matter? Hey. You okay? Jeez. You son of a bitch, I might not have much going on in life but I at least slept well. Why show up in 28 years and shit around, huh? You bastard, who else would call me at this time but you? You bastard. Hey, just go away or crash in bed if you drank so much. What? Hey. Are you crying? You miss what. Then don't call me. Just crawl over here or whatever, you bastard. Jae-moon, have a drink. Yes, sir. Crazy bastard. What's up with the candle and two grown men? Getting into the mood? Why would I get into the mood with him? There's been a blackout. Oh, there are blackouts here too. Sometimes. Just this place. This house is more than a hundred years old. It's nice though. It's just like a stage. Stage, my ass. Hey, So-dam. Is it okay for you to hang around like this? Aren't your parents worried? My mom's okay with it and my dad's not talkative. Your mom is open-minded, huh? She wasn't around since I was a kid. Huh? She passed away. Maybe. What do you mean maybe? If she passed away, she's passed away. She ran away with another guy when I was five years old. So I don't know what happened ever since. Maybe, yeah. Maybe. Your dad brought you up alone, huh. I didn't have a stepmother, so I guess. Your dad is a great man. But I understand my mom. Huh? I would've run away too if I were her. You're really mean. It wouldn't be half an hour if I were to sum up all the conversations I had with my dad since I was young. He might be a good man out there, but he's the kind of guy who feels almost invisible at home, you know. There and not there, like an old tree. Your life is pretty tough too, huh. Don't worry about me. You guys take care of yourselves. Right. But doesn't this really feel like a stage? Do you want to put on an act? What? An act? You keep on saying stage and stuff but have you ever been on stage? Do you know what theater is? You just go with the flow. This kid is looking down on theater. What's the act? Go with the flow. So what act are we putting on? I'll play Soon-yi. What? The act is the three of us in a romantic relationship. Is this a psychodrama or something? What the hell is this? Hae-hyo. Jae-moon. We've come to this point, and I'll be honest. I really, really love both of you. I can't love just one person, can I? You okay with me like this? Both of you? Must you have it that way? Yes. I have no choice. Okay, fine. But I really don't think this is going to work. How could l... you... with him... at the same time. No, that can't be. Let's do it like this. Split the week in half. One half with me, the other half with him. I can do that. There are 7 days in a week. What's going to happen with the extra day? I'm older, so I have 4 days and you have 3 days. Okay? No way. That extra day... is for the one who wins rock-paper-scissors. Rock, scissor... Huh? (Japanese) Welcome. Hello. What would you like? One beer, please. Poison? Oh, it's an old medicine box. Oh. Poison What's in it now? Poison Candies? Excuse me, may I ask for a favor? Sure. Pretty, isn't it? It's cute. But she's a bit of a trouble-maker. Could you take care of her so she won't go anywhere? The toys here are all stuff that people left. Leave it to us. Nice. It's dumbfounding, having to see such a nice thing with you. Why? I like it. It's just dumbfounding. Stop fumbling around and make a bet. You bastard, you're dead meat today. Time has passed, but I know you inside out. You're going to bet on one, huh? ¥500 on one, three. Two. Shoot We used to do a lot of this with Soon-yi, the three of us. I tried to be okay after Soon-yi left, but I couldn't stand what a mess you became. That's why I came here. I got to see you before too late, so it's all good. Three, two. One. This got weird. Make a bet. One, three. - Right. - Damn it. Who bets on ¥500 at a time? I can't see the steel tower from here. The tower? Oh, the TV tower. You should be able to see it from here. Where is it? Do you want to make a bet? Now what. I'll team up with Yuki, you-two team up, and let's see who finds it first. How about that? (Japanese) Okay, I like it. Start! Hey, that's the wrong way. Let's run. Wait a minute, why don't I see it? Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up. Let's have a bite of this and then go. Bite of what? This one. (Japanese) One, please. (Japanese) Here you go. Hae-hyo, how about I run the bar and you run the bookstore in Seoul. Should we change places? Are you nuts? What's all that baloney? - Hey, Jae-moon. - Huh? What do you think of So-dam? This is so you. What is? What are you trying to trigger now? Trigger what? Just answer. What do you think of So-dam? I said she's a nutjob. Is that all? - Kind of cute. - Yeah? Kind of sexy too, I guess. Yeah, okay. Then what if So-dam had joined our drama club when we were young? Would you have liked her? Does she look like a woman to you? Don't make me into a pervert. Just answer. I said what if. I'm asking you, would you have liked So-dam if she had joined our drama club when we were young? Of course not. No? But if I were any younger now, who knows what would have happened. Yeah? Yeah. Hae-hyo? What? Are we really similar? Fuck that baloney again. Get lost, you bastard. What nonsense! Hey, she wants you to come out. Me? She says for you to come out as well. Why? What? Where have you been? What would your bar look like from up there? What? Well, it must look small, like a matchbox. Never thought about it. I guess I'm kind of curious. Yeah. (Japanese) Excuse me. Excuse me. People here don't even breathe. That's the culture. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. You bastard. Sumimasen. Wow, I'm all the way up here. You're a pass to everywhere. The superintendent here is my regular customer. Let's see. Over there. You see my bar? Yeah. People seem so small from up here. Yeah. You must look like a friggin' ant when you head out of that bar. Yeah, you bastard. What's your bookstore's phone number? I don't know. Well, if it hasn't been changed for 20 years, it should be 332-1703. There passes a long-winded day And over Mother-earth is the darkness That tells the end of today Unable to fill in today's hollow I shall put off till tomorrow Searching for my love Where my soul can rest upon a dream Until the day breaks With my body in rest Will I meet my beloved upon a dream
