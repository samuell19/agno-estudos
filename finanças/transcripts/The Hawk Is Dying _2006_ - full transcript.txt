- No, not the bag, the logo. - Okay, I see. All right. You sure? How about, have you seen the Burberry? That's a thing people like a lot. - I don't like the Burberry. - No? All right. - No. - What's the make and model of your car? - Ford Excursion. - Front leather buckets? - Yes. - How big? - All over the seat. - You meet me outside I gotta go check with my foreman. - Okay. Hey? An Excursion, leather buckets? - Not nuts about this. - By Friday? - George, how you doin' with that hawk of yours? - It died. Wouldn't eat. - That's too bad. - It's not too good on Fred either. If I lose another one I don't think he could stand it, I don't think I could stand it. - Lord to-day. Boy, I bet you that thing is tight enough to squeeze the balls off a nut, don't you think? - I'm not thinking about that. - What you just saw? Dude, it's not natural not to think about something like that. - Friday? - Yeah, no problem. - [George] Let me know when you're done. Wouldn't mind going home a little bit early today. Hey, my foreman says he can do it easy by Friday. All right, so you want to cover the whole thing? - Seats and the steering wheel... - [George] And the steering wheel? (whistling) (hawk calling) - Work hard, they say, and you'll be happy. Get a car, get a house, get a business, get money, get, get, get, it's all a dead end, son. - Cork. - (laughing) Yeah, you're goddamn right, cork. - Cork. - Come on. (sighing) Oh God. You know what? We're going to take that tangle trap out again tomorrow and we're going to try again All right? I'm going to take the day off. Come on. - Cheek. - Yeah. (quiet music) (garbage disposal) (crickets) (quiet music) (bass beats of dance music) Hey. Betty! (distant laughter) - I thought you said you weren't going to come by tonight. - Yeah. - Yeah, what? - I said I couldn't come tonight. - [Betty] And here you are. (distant party voices) (dance music) (hip hop music) I want to continue your interview. Okay. Where were we in the life of George Gattling? You have any dreams lately? - No. - [Betty] Come on. - I can't remember them. - Tell me what it's like living with your sister. And Fred. - I'm not your case study. - Maybe you are. Fine. When am I going to meet Fred? - Khorsabad. - Khorsabad? - [George] Right. - What is that? - It's in Babylonia. Yeah. It's in ancient Babylonia. I saw this picture of a Babylonian, with a hawk on his fist. - Ugh! - You realize that training hawks hasn't died out, not ever? Not even for a little while, in over 3,000 years. Atila the king of the Huns had a hawk on his helmut. I read that if a hawk doesn't want to be trained, it possesses the last inviolable sanctuary of death. - I'm not interested. - You were. - Well I'm not. - George you know this is getting old. Did you come over here to fuck me? - I came here to talk. Did I ever tell you about Louis and Clark? There was an expedition I would have liked to be a part of. They traveled all over the country meeting Indian chiefs, medicine men... They grew corn here during the Civil War. And then 20 years later it was lake again, they got the interstate on it now. And all the water's controlled with pumps and canals. Jesus, and that's the part the Department of Natural Resources is the proudest of. You can tell by the way they wrote it on the sign back there. Always a park and by God it's going to stay a park. Natural resource. Natural with a thousand pumps working day and night the whole thing is depressing. Come on. (birds and insects calling) (hawk calling) Oh my God. Oh my God, Fred. We got one. Fred, come on. Come on, Fred, come on. Shit. Okay boy, yeah, look at that. Come on, come on. - Yay! - Careful, Fred. Oh my God, oh my God. Jesus Christ. Fred! Come on! (hawk calling) Careful, boy Careful, careful, Easy, easy, easy. Jesus. Careful Fred, careful boy. Careful, careful. Thatta boy. Thatta boy. Thatta boy. (hawk squawking) - This is for Julia Roberts. What do you like most about working with Richard Gere? - Oh Jesus, not now Precious. - No, just try and guess. - Goddammit, she's so big I don't know what the hell I'm going to do. - No, it's his hair. - [George] What? - It's not how big he is, it's his hair, Julia says it complements his other talents. This one is for Colin Powell. What did the kill ratio average out to for the entire Gulf War? - I got another hawk. - George, you didn't. - No, no, no, this is different, believe me. - You say everything's going to be different and it never is. - All right.. - All right, this one is for... - Listen to me, I need leather for heavier jesses, because the sparrow hawk jesses are not going to hold this one. What'd you do with my leather? - You know, there's no reason to be short with me. I... I just can't stand another one of those things in the clothes closet. You know, the bell jingling, getting weaker. - This one... - Dying. - This one's not going in the closet. - Well where do you think it's going to go.. - Oh God! Dammit! I can't stand here and talk about it, let's go! - Okay, I'll get it for you... - Good girl! Let's go! (clapping) - You just talk to your sister like she's a nobody, because everybody knows that she's nothin' but a nobody. - Sounds like a song. - Who's been mistreated all her life... Good Lord! You left him out there alone! - [George] He'll be fine, he'll be fine, just give me a minute, I got a cut new jesses then you can see her. - Where did all that all that blood come from? - That's mostly the rat. - Oh. - Don't worry I can handle it. - Good Lord. Fred? Fred, honey? Come on, darling. Come on and I'm going to read the funnies to you, all right? We got Sluggo, we got Snoopy from Peanuts, you like all that. - Hey, I want Fred to help, I told Fred he could help. - Come on, let's go, we're going to watch. - Precious? Hey? Come on now, don't you want to see her? Shit. (hawk squawking) Thatta girl. (wings flapping) Oh my God, you want to kill me, don't you? (hawk squawking) Fred and I caught a hawk. No, this is different, believe me. She's a red-tailed hawk, she's huge. I want you to come over, I want you to see her. No, later, after everyone's gone to bed. All right? Betty? Hello? - [Foreman] You can't never look at it though? - No, no, no. Never look her in the eye. - I don't wanna be near anything I can look in the eye. - So take her meat everyday, you don't look at her and maybe you make the same sound every time when you come close, you know, maybe a little tune that you whistle, maybe a little cooing sound, something like that. - Coo sound? - And you make that cooing sound, every time you go down there to the hawk with food. And pretty soon you'll find that it'll calm the bird, make her steady. - [Precious] But no water. - [Foreman] Why is that? - Well the whole time he was starving the bird in the closet we didn't give him any water to drink. - Why hell, that's how come the damn thing died. You try giving it some water this time and see if it don't live longer. - Birds of prey drink no water, unless they're sick. - Everything drink water, George. Goddamn, even old Fred here drink. - Well hawks don't! All right? And they throw up too. - Shit, I've been known to throw up a bit myself. (laughing) - Hammer! - A grown hawk can swallow an entire chicken's wing, bone, feathers and all, you think you could do that? Little while later then, what they don't use they throw it up in a little ball. - Shit. I don't want no throw up no balls! (laughing) - I tell you what else, I'll tell you what else. The old time falconers, they used to eat it, once a week, yep, they'd eat that little ball of feather and bone. They said it made them better falconers, and that's a fact. - [Foreman] I knew a man ate dog. I swear. - I'm not surprised. - And he liked it. He had a farm, raised him, had a whole smokehouse full of dog. He had himself, mongrel, chihuahuas, and a little fat pug, and he loved hound best. (quiet music) (thudding) (hawk squawking) (distant conversation) - She won't die, I promise you that. (hawk squawking) (talking and laughing in distance) Oh, Jesus Christ. (sighing) - [Precious] George? - Yeah? Will you be all right for the party? - Yeah. We're just going to go for a little while. I gotta talk to Marvin, that's all. I gotta talk to him about the hawk. I don't know what to do. - Fine. - All right. Come on, hurry up. - All right I'm getting ready now! - Okay. You know I've been thinking about something. - Yeah? - Don't you think it's about time that Fred had a friend? - You know I do. Why, you know somebody? - Well, yeah, I've had a girl in mind for some time, actually. - Can you do this? - Yeah. A girl from the University. - Honey, watch this, I don't know about that... - Listen to me, she's a psychology major, her name's Betty, I met her through one of the professors comes into the shop. - Oh, I wish but... - Hold on, she knows how he is and she's interested in him the way he is. So I was just thinking maybe I'd give her a call and ask her to come over here tonight while we go to the party. - You think she'd do it? - Oh, in a minute. (sighing) - Just call her. - Call her? - Yeah, call her. - Hey. - George. Is he here or are you fucking with me? - Yeah, he's here but I want to show you the hawk real quick first, all right? The perfect red-tailed hawk. What the hell is that? - A pop tart. - Come on, come on, real quick, you've never seen anything like this. - Are you going to kill this one too? - I didn't kill any of those other ones. And I'm not gonna kill this one, you understand me? - Shh... you cruel son of a bitch. I'll look at your hawk when you get back from your party. Let's go meet Fred. - Hey! So, this is my sister, Precious, this is Fred's mother, this is Betty, the young lady I told you about. - I'm so glad you could come. - Thank you, thank you for having me. - Um, well, come on in. - This is Betty, Fred. And she's come to spend the evening with you, all right? Yeah, so. - Hi. - Hey, why don't we show Betty what we trapped today? - [Precious] Yeah, that'd be nice. - Yeah, I think she's going to find this interesting. Look at that. Look Look! That's a real hawk, that's a real hawk. When are you leaving for the party? - We're leaving for the party now. - Now? - Yeah, get your jacket. Fred, go get your mother. - Come here, sweet pea here we go. - He's fine, get your jacket come on. - Nice to meet you. - Thank you. - Sit down Fred. (Christmas carols) (whistling) (piano music) (multiple conversations) - Hi - Hi you guys, it's been so long. - Hey there, hey. - Just the man I want to see. George, you know that tint job that you recommend that I have on my windshield? I think there's something wrong with it. I mean, I don't know but it's kind of like rippling and turning blue and I can't really drive the car real well. - I will speak to my foreman, Billy Bob about that. That's not good. - Because you do stand behind your work? - Absolutely we will deliver satisfaction, ma'am. - You know George, you're really not lookin' real good. - You know, Professor, I'm not feeling too good tonight. - Why not? - Well, nothing, just a hawk. - Hawk? - She's a red-tailed hawk, I've been busy with a red-tailed hawk. - You're training another hawk? Oh, come on, George, you don't have another hawk? - How's that study that you're doing going? How is that? - My study's going just fine, George. Don't try to change the subject, all right? You know how I feel about this. You have been starving another hawk, haven't you? - I have not been starving anything. I've been training the most beautiful red-tailed hawk that you're ever going to see. - You are drunk, George. - Yeah, not enough, Professor, I'll tell you that. - You have no right to do that it's inhumane... - Of course he has a right. Everything needs training [Professor] No he does not That is barbaric and he does not have a right - [Man] That's why countries have Presidents, - [Professor] to do that - [Man] it's why armies have generals, it's why universities have professors. - [Professor] Really, and why don't you stay out of it? - [Man] And it's why people have God. - [Professor] I disagree with you. - [Man] Okay, well I disagree with you, Merry Christmas. - [Professor] Yeah, Merry Christmas to you too. (crickets) (whistling) - You should try to mingle maybe. - Well these people are boring - There's interesting people. - No, they're boring, I have nothing in common with these people, - How would you know? You're sitting here. - Because I can tell. Nobody's looking at me, nobody's saying hi to me. What? - Hey! Hey, Marvin! - George. - I've been looking for you. - Good to see you, I'm glad you made it. - Yeah. - I wanted to tell you how much I appreciated everything you did for our son's car, Billy Bob did a fantastic job. - I got another hawk. - That's the nicest thing I've heard all night. Tell you what, let's go freshen our drinks, - Yeah. - and I've got something I want to show you. - All right. - All right? - Yeah. - I'm not taking you away from the ladies, (laughing) - Let's go. (crickets) (quiet music) - Water. - [Marvin] Beautiful, isn't it? - I've never seen one like that. - [Marvin] That's a great horned owl. - Must be something to see a bird like that fly. - [Marvin] It is. Oh it is. You should have seen her when she landed in my yard two months ago. That's when I shot the son of a bitch. - You shot the owl? You shot this owl? - Hm-mm. Well I had to George, he was picking up my chickens. - Oh. Well this wise old own wasn't so wise letting you get a shot at her, right? - None of them wise, George. Owl's the stupidest bird that flies. - Stupid? An owl? - Stupid. I can assure you that the owl is a profoundly stupid bird. - Oh shit. - Far cry from the noble hawk. Now tell me more about this new one you've got. What are you going to do? - I don't know, see, I don't know because every other method I've ever tried has failed, miserably, you know? - Sorry. Celia's about to do a reading. - Well, listen - Do you have to go? - Have you thought about, now listen to me, thought about watching this hawk. - Putting it around my wrist wild. - Yes. - Yeah, yeah. But I don't know... - Give it a try. - I read about it in books but.. - Listen to me, George. In this culture, it's possible for a man to live his whole life and never know whether he's a coward or not. And George, I think a man ought to know. And by God, you'll know where you stand after watching a red-tailed hawk. Can't sleep until you break them. Or they break you. Just put that thing on your wrist, wild, if it flies off you put it back on your wrist. You see the key George is to get the bird to eat from your hand. Thing is you don't eat, you don't eat till the bird eats. It could be as tough on you as it is on them. Take four, five days, maybe longer. - All I know is I gotta do it right this time, I gotta do it right. - Yeah, well, I don't know I might just full of shit, George. (laughing) I've never actually manned a hawk myself, just read the books like you. (laughing) - Yeah. - Think about it. All right? I gotta go listen to Celia. - All right. - [Precious] Oh, the girl's still here. That's a good sign. - Yeah. Hey. Hey you okay? What are you doing out here? - I was just leaving. - So what'd you do? - [Betty] Talked. - Talked? - [Betty] Yeah. - About? - Everything. - Did you look at the hawk after I left? - Yeah. - You did? What'd you think? - I gotta go. Goodnight. (car engine starting) Goodnight. - Fred? Fred? Goodnight, son. (crickets and frogs) (quiet music) (hawk squawking) Hey. (kissing sounds) (hawk squawking) Come on, there you go (whistling) Right there. Down here turn around come on (hawk squawking) Right here, right here, there it is, there it is. Come on. Son of a bitch. (laughing) All right. (kissing sounds) (screaming and crying) What the hell is going on? What's going on? (crying) What the hell's going on? - He's dead! Oh, my baby! (wailing) - Oh no. - What did my baby do to deserve this? (wailing) - Try to calm down. Calm down god dammit! - Do something, do something, call the... - Listen I want to talk to Dr. Leep. What? It's a... drowning, listen I want to talk to Dr. Leep. Um... I'm sorry, I didn't know who to call, we need help. Yeah. Have I tried what? No I've never done that (crying) it was too late, I was too late! I don't know, I don't know! What? Um... It's George Gattling. Yes! Just send a goddamn ambulance please. What'd you do to that goddamn boy? He's dead. He's dead. And I want to know what you did to him, (shouting) I want to know what you did to him god dammit! Fuck. - George? George? George, did you call somebody? - Yeah I called an ambulance. - An ambulance? Oh. Oh. An ambulance. Thank God. I do thank God. - Jesus H. Christ. - I do. I thank the sweet baby Jesus. (crying) Well, better, uh... get him up and get him dressed. - What? - Get him dressed. Get him, get him, ready for the hospital. I'll get him ready for the hospital. (phone ringing) (distant sirens) (hawk squawking) - Come here, come here (quiet music) - Uh, my name's Bubba. We got the boy in the ambulance. Now don't you think you should come up to the house now? - The owl is a stupid bird. - The owl is not my favorite bird either. - Listen, listen, listen to what I'm saying about the owl. - Oh, the damn owl. - No, no, no, you don't know why I said it. I once got an owl, not a real one, a paper one, from the principal. It was the third grade. I had the best grades. - Well, you look like an intelligent man. - Goddammit, will you listen to what i'm saying? - [Bubba] Right. - Owls aren't smart, do you see that? It's just another thing that wasn't right, that was an opposite. - Damn right. I see. - It doesn't matter. And it wouldn't matter if it hadn't have come when it did. - [Doctor] George, I just want you to come inside. - No, I can't, doc, I can't. - George, I got a couple of pills here, that will help you relax, okay? - My name is George Gattling. I own L&S Custom Auto Trim. My shop's foreman's name is Billy Bob Mavis he comes from the same place I do, Bainbridge, Georgia. I live here, 2611 Northwest Eighth Avenue in Gainesville, Florida with my sister and her son, my nephew, dead by drowning in his own bed. Your name is Dr. Leep. And if you force me to take any of those pills or touch my hawk, I will sue you for all the money you have or ever expect to make, and I will name in that suit the ambulance company that sent that driver squatting in the bushes over there, and that same driver, by the name Bubba and all his family. - George, I sedated your sister. I think a day in the hospital would do her good. And I suppose you could make funeral arrangements for the boy. (hawk squawking) - You're all right, you're all right. You're okay, you're okay. All right. Stay in there, now. Shit. There you go, there you go. There you go. Betty? I want to set something straight. What'd you do to Fred? (crying) (hawk squawking) - [Betty] Go away, please go away. Go away! - Look. Whoa, whoa, whoa Easy, easy, easy! Easy! - I wish I could tell you everything. I know you want to know but I can't because I don't know myself. When we were sitting down by the creek watching the hawk, Fred kissed me. He just put his mouth on mine. And I just sat there and I didn't know what to do. When it got too dark to watch the hawk, he took my hand and he led me back to his room, never saying a word, just looking at me. Just looking at me, you know how he could look, just, a word. What he did, was he measured me, with those hands, that's what it felt like. He traced me with his hands. And it felt like I was being... separated. - Don't tell me, I don't want to know. I don't want to know anymore. Do you understand how I feel? How the hell did I ever get mixed up with you? A goddamn doctor's daughter. You pretend to be poor white trash. - I just want you to know what happened. - I loved him! This whole goddamn thing is my fault! (crying) (quietly singing) Settle down Just look around the room, that's it. Look at the chair and look at the feather, shh no, no, no, no look at the bicycle and look at the ceiling. That's it look at the table. And look at the floors. - God almighty. (hawk squawking and rustling) - You scared the bird. Goddammit, don't look at the hawk! - Look I ain't going to look at your damn hawk. - Don't you shout. You already scared the bird. - You scare me, George. Look I thought you was in here being crazy. Betty called me so told me something was going on, what's going on, George? George, did you call your mom? - No! - Did you call anybody? - Yeah, I called Betty. - Good god, look I don't want to know. I don't want to hear nothing, don't tell me, - Stop, come on, would you please don't! If you come any closer you scare the bird! - George, I just.. want to tell you, I'll take care everything, okay? I'm gonna call your mom, then I'm going to find out where they took the boy, okay? Now, you sit there and you just relax. - Jesus Christ, I'm not crazy. - [Billy Bob] I never said you were. - Yeah, you know when you say shit like that you make me sound crazy. - But, that's not what I meant. - Oh come on, don't... You tell me to relax, this is no time to relax, only a madman could relax! - Okay! - All right! - Okay. - [George] All right. - What the? - Shh.. - I'm going to go upstairs and use the telephone. - Good. Oh Jesus, you've got to be kidding me. - I ought to jerk your goddamned arm off and beat you with the bloody end. Don't you got any goddamn respect for the goddamn dead? Now you listen to me. My boy's dead. People have come to bury him. I have come to bury him, and I'm going to give you to ten to get that goddamned thing off your hand. Come on up in the house and act like a man, act like somebody decent. I'm going to beat your fucking face right off your fucking head. - Yeah. - Did you get that clear? One. Two. Three. I'm not shitting, George. - Yeah, yeah, you're not shitting. - Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. - Brother you could never train a hawk. - What? - No you see the hawk has a very delicate nervous system and it cannot be trained by an asshole. No, a bad man cannot train a hawk. Anybody wants to work a hawk, they got to have, they got to have simple human feeling, you understand? Because the bird it tunes, right into your blood, right into your heart, and it knows everything you know, and it feels everything you feel. If you can't feel you can't work a hawk. You're just a, you're just a rock, pretending that you're a man, Alonzo. - Don't pretend you're talking about the hawk. It's Fred you meant, wasn't it? It's my son. - That's it, that's it. - It's easy to say I don't feel. That I don't love. That I'm a rock. Well let me tell you something, rock's don't lose their sons, asshole! What could you know about it? - Nothing, I couldn't know anything about it. - You damn right, you never had a wife. - No. - You never had a son. - No. - I was afraid. Can you understand that? I was afraid. But I never stopped thinking about him. Never once, not in 20 years did I ever stop thinking. Somewhere my son was being stared at. People feeling sorry for him, pointing at him. - Yeah. - I tell you what, if you don't get up in that house and act decent, and act like a man, this fucking rock is going to kick your fucking ass. - Come on, Alonzo, go on, kick my ass! Kick my ass! (laughing) What's the matter? - You don't forget what I said. - Son? - Oh goddammit. - Son? Son, what are you doing out here? Everybody's waiting for you to come on back in the house. - I'm not coming in. - You want me to send preacher Roe out here? - What? - Preacher Roe, he come with us. He's just interested in the Lord's work, and, and, and your soul and things like that. - Things like what? What are you talking about? - You've got that bird on your arm. Oh! Oh! - Don't worry about her she's fine, she just does that. - Why? - When she's trained she'll be able to pick up a half-grown dog. - [Ma] Dog? - That's right. - I'll get the preacher. (hawk squawking) - Oh God. - Time of tragedy. - Yes, yes, sir. - Life is a tragedy. - Yes. - Suffering, sickness, - Broken bones and broken spirits, yes sir. - All flesh was made to rot. God in his wisdom knows why. - Dust to dust. - Amen. - Shh, shh, shh. - You can tell me about it now. - What do you want to know? - What is the hawk? - A hunter. - No, I mean, what is the hawk? - A killer, a natural killer. Oh! And who did you kill? - It only kills what she'll eat. - I'm talking about you, you. - I don't understand. - Why do you put the hawk on your arm? You can tell me, you can tell me anything. - Let me touch the hawk, think it'll let me? (distant shouting) Now, tell me why George? (dog barking) George! Come on back here! - [Alonzo] Goddammit George! (multiple voices calling) - {Preacher] George your mama's over here worried about you, come on back here. - [Alonzo] Come on George! (heavy breathing) (quiet music) - [Voiceover] You never have. - [Voiceover] No, I never have. - Wake up. Wake up. (frogs croaking) (hawk squawking) (distant voices) (moaning) - Jesus God. Aw, shit. (quiet music) I had a, I don't know, a dream, some kind of vision, a.. I don't know, some kind of thing, I don't know. Yeah. Uh, I'm at a phone at the corner of University and Third. What? (hawk squawking) Ow! Ow, come on. Oh, shit, you're all right, you're all right. Fuck, come here. I need help. - Okay. Well why don't I go get us some coffee? - Yeah, that's a good idea. Black all right? - I know. Are you hungry? - No, I'm not. Come here. (hawk squawking) - Oh, George. Tell me when the last time was that you ate something. - I can't eat until all of this is over. - Till all what's over? - Manning that hawk. She won't eat I can't eat. Or sleep. No, I have to have water so that's allowed. Bird, bird doesn't need water, so. So she can go without, so - George? Hey? I'll be right back, all right? I'm just going to get us some coffee. But I want to hear everything. Oh, Bubba, you gotta be so hungry. You gotta be starving, I understand. I want you to eat. Come on, baby, I want you to eat. I want you to eat. Come on. Ah, the hell with it. - [Betty] You never have what? - He didn't say. - [Betty] He just said "you never have?" - Yeah. - [Betty] And what did you say? - I said no, I never have. - [Betty] You answered him like you knew what the question meant? - Yes, I seemed to know. - [Betty] Uh-huh. But you didn't, or you don't. you don't know. - No. No. - [Betty] And when you saw Fred lying there in the woods you weren't able to, ah, Jesus. That's Piers Plowman, shit that's classic - What does it mean? - [Betty] George, I'm really not that qualified. Honestly, I just don't know. - [George] Shh.. You gotta help me do something. I gotta see the boy. - Fred? - Yeah. - Maybe in a few hours... - Now. - What? - I need to see him. I need to see him alone, and there won't be anybody else there now. You gotta help me do this. (car engine starting) (hawk squawking) Oh goddammit, I'm all right, I'm all right. (knocking on door) Oh Jesus. - George? I got it... Hey, good evening, we're here to see Fred Lepzog. My name's George Gattling. - I'm Peter Sweet, and you are? - I'm George Gattling. - Your relationship to the deceased? - Uncle. But uh, but I raised the boy like a father, and this young lady was very close to Fred too. - Well, um, this morning at 10, we have... - No, see, I have to see him now, because this may be the only time I get to see him alone. You understand? - I understand perfectly. - Good. - You're going to have to leave that out here. - No, I'm sorry. I.. I can't leave the hawk, the hawk has to stay with me. - There's no pets allowed in the mortuary. - I'm sorry? - No pets allowed. - No, (laughing), this is not a pet. - It's not. - No. - I'm sorry, excuse me? Can I speak to you alone for a moment? - Of course, certainly. - Thank you. - This way. (hawk squawking) - Yeah? - Right this way. - What the hell did you say to him? - Don't worry about it. - Thank you. There you are. Yeah, all right. That ain't him. Little boy. You know his father fled, the minute he realized that Fred wasn't normal. He just fled the scene of the crime. (hawk squawking) You hear that? - Do you think that Fred ever pretended anything? - No. Uh-huh, no, not him. No. That boy never pretended anything. - God. - What? - He said "love." - What? - He put his hand on me and said "love." - He said love, huh? (hawk squawking) (glass breaking) - Oh God! Oh God, oh God! He got stuck! Oh shit! - Would you get the hawk off please? - I can't! I can't, she won't turn loose. - Then we'll have to cut it's feet off. - No! We can't do that! We cannot hurt this hawk! We cannot hurt the hawk I'm not crazy.... - [Peter] Uh... I don't think that I am, but under no circumstances can we hurt this hawk. - Well we certainly can't hurt Fred. - The young lady's right, if we can't cut the hawk we have to cut something. - [George] Oh God! (vomiting) - [Betty] George? - [George] Oh (moaning) - [Betty] What? What? What? What is it? - I just gotta (grunting) - [Betty] George? George look at me, are you okay? George? (hawk squawking) (heavy breathing) (quiet music) - [Voiceover] Never have - [George] What do you mean I never have? - [Peter] And a good photograph to work from, he'll give you the rest of the face, with any look that you want. Defiant, accepting, happy, quisical, anything really. Uncle Hubert can do anything with a face - [Betty] It's okay now - but make it breathe again. - [Betty] Good morning, sunshine. Easy. I got you. - [Peter] You can look now. - Look at what? - [Peter] I made it right. - Hawk needs air, hawk needs air. - [Peter] (sighing) - George? (quiet music) - I can't go back home yet. (insect and frogs calling) - Keep it, it's for you. - You stayed here for me, huh. You know in, in Bacon County, Georgia, where I come from, a swarm of high-circling buzzards usually means that there's a, usually means there's some kind of trouble. And you know, you gotta go out and look around and see that there's not, a hog, a cow or something down dying, maybe dead already just lying around in the field... One day, my grandpa dropped dead out in the field while he was out uh, working, plowing he just, he just dropped dead next to the mule. I was a boy. And I saw the buzzards from the front porch, so I knew that something was wrong. I followed the buzzards, they led me right to him. Jesus, I didn't know, I didn't know what to do. Had no idea what to do. (hawk squawking) Goddammit all I remember was wanting to reach up and grab those goddamn monsters out of the sky, they were everywhere, everywhere, monsters, goddammit, I wanted to pull them down and just rip 'em apart, eat 'em alive. Jesus. But them, up above them, I saw this hawk. So high up there. But it was watching. No, I know that he was watching. Oh, and that son of a bitch, I saw that hawk stoop. That's what they call it when a bird of prey dives down on his victim, I saw that, beautiful, goddamn hawk stoop. He was like a, like a comet, he was like a, he was like a streak of fire coming out of the sky and he just he just hit him like a hammer and he just ripped him apart. He ripped the sky open! Fierce son a bitch. So much goddamn force, and after that there was nothing. Sky was just empty. (laughing) Son of a bitch. Stupid goddamn buzzards. Boy, this isn't like drinking beer. - Yeah? I don't know. I've been told it is like drinking beer. - Yeah? - Yeah. But I don't know because I don't drink beer so I don't know, but that's what I've been told. - Well don't you believe them. You understand? - Okay. - Hm-mmm, yeah. Liars. Yeah, you know what? I'm going in. Look at that, I'm going in. - The water? - Yeah. - Aw, this I'd pay to see. - Yeah? You don't need to pay nothing to see, watch this. Oh man. Thatta girl. (quiet music) - You made a believer out of that bird. - Yeah. All right, watch this. Aquaman! Aquaman! (splashing) (quiet music) (yelling) - It's okay. This is where you wanted to go, right? - I know what Fred meant when he said I never have There's nothing out there to have except for a period. I might has well admit it. Oh, I never have. Take that. You're all right, shh. I know that you're ready to eat, I'm going to fix you something nice. Oh, hey. - They're all looking for you - What? - Come on, just sit down and rest, - I got to get.. - [Ma] You want a little coffee - Yeah, Trish get him a cup a coffee - I aint tired, and I don't want coffee, I gotta get the knife and feed the bird. - You need some coffee. - No, I'm all right, Ma, all right? - You're soaking wet.
