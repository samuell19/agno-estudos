(Brad laughing) - What is the tiniest girl doing handling our largest cable? - Go fuck yourself. - Careful, there's a reason we call her Mighty Mouse. - Well, Mighty Mouse, make me hot. - Excuse me? - I need power to my dimmers. Do you know how to hook those up? - Fucking asshole. - Yeah, no problem, she'll take care of it. - [Blonde Man] Just don't blow us up, sweetie. - I'm sure he's got a small dick too. - [Sasha] Power going hot. - Sasha, you went hot on lighting power? - Yeah, so? - [Scott] So? So it's Sean's job, don't do it again. - Yeah, well, Sean's gone MIA. He's probably in the dimmer room getting high. - [Scott] I don't care. Not your job, stick to what you do best, pushing cases from the door to the stage! Brad. - [Brad] Yeah? - [Scott] You need an extra gig this week? - Yeah, actually. - [Sasha] I'll take the call, Scott. - It will be too big, it's two semis, I'd have to get an extra guy. - [Sasha] What? (dramatic music) Fucker. - [Scott] Fine. I need a climber, you want that? - Yes. - You happy now? - I'll be happy when you book me like one of the guys. - I'm not your buddy, Sasha, I just need to get shit done! (soft music) (phone ringing) (soft music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Michael] Funny story, when I hire a pianist for a tour I expect her to be at the venue on time. (dramatic music) (soft piano music) - We still got a whole truck out there, Sasha. - I just took my hands off this one. - If you can't handle the push I can call someone else. - [Sasha] Do you see anyone else walking up and down the hallways? - Oh, so you think you can drop cases from a triple stack? - Gonna be a hell of a lot easier than pushing cases a quarter of a mile on my own. - I thought you could use the experience, but I guess I was wrong. - Experience, you call this experience? - I don't got time for this Sasha, cases are backing up. These kids today think they know everything. - What an asshole. - Tell me about it. - I'm Elisabeth. - I've got some cases in the hallway I should probably... - Do you want a hand? - You want to help me push cases? - [Elisabeth] Sure, why not? - I don't think our insurance will cover your toes. - Well, I don't really need my toes. My fingers though. - Your fingers? - Not really cut out to be that four fingered pianist. (Sasha scoffing) - Yeah, pianist, right. I've got some cases backing up, so... - [Elisabeth] Do you like "The L Word?" - Do I like "The?" Yes, I do like "The L Word." Do you? - You wanna go grab a coffee or something? (Sasha stammering) I mean, I'm alone with all these guys. And the doors aren't open until seven. - Sure. - Yeah? - Why not? I'm never gonna see you again. - How 'bout later? - How 'bout now? (upbeat music) (Elisabeth giggling) (Sasha chuckling) Ooh. - God. God. Oh my God. Oh my God. (Elisabeth screaming) (Sasha laughing) Okay. What is this place? - Gear storage. - [Elisabeth] And you kidnap musicians often? - Only the cute ones. You play your cards right and I might take you on a date to craft services. - Ooh, so charming. - I do try and be as smooth as possible. Hey, do you want to learn how to wrap the cable? (Sasha groaning) - Sure. - XLR, microphone. (upbeat music continues) - Oh, 'sup, Sasha? - Hey. - [Brad] Licking some box on some boxes? (Sasha laughing) Well, have fun. - Oh, what an ass. (upbeat music continues) - You just kissed me. - I did. Look, are you straight? 'Cause the whole "L Word" reference could go either way. - I'm super gay. I definitely want more kissing. Just unexpected, go for it. - What have I got to lose, I'm never gonna see you again? - You're going to see me again. - Oh really, is that right? - I like you. - Well, I like you too. Still never gonna see you again. - Okay, I mean, it's not the ideal dating situation. - Whoa. Sorry? - Don't over complicate it. - Me, over complicate? - Yeah, I can tell your the type, you know, to over complicated things. - I'm not the one talking about dating. I was just having some fun. - [Elisabeth] You wanna see me again? - Sure. - Okay, then you will. - You know this is it, right? The show will start, you'll play, it'll end. I'll load out, and you'll be long gone before the truck is even packed. (upbeat music continues) - I'll be back, I'll make sure of it. You live in Los Angeles, you're not on the moon or anything. (Sasha sighing) - I'm so screwed. - [Michael] Elisabeth. - What did I do now? - I'm sending you home early. We have another pianist coming in. - You're firing me? - Oh no, no. I decided you're going to be a project of mine. - A project? - You've got talent and the right last name. - My family last name is not relevant anymore. - Go pack your bags, I have a studio gig lined up for you in Paris in the meantime. The Anelare name deserves more than this. (dramatic music) - [Elisabeth] Dear Sasha, life is great here in Paris. I wish we could have spent more time together. We'll see each other soon again. I promise, remember? - [Sasha] Dear Elisabeth, I've never been to Paris. I'd never thought of being anywhere but LA. I never thought about a lotta things, actually. Not that we'll ever see each other again. - [Elisabeth] Sasha, I can think of nothing but having you here in person, it's all I think about. - [Sasha] Elisabeth, I can't believe it's been four months. When will I get to see you again? - [Elisabeth] Sasha, Michael booked a new tour. I'll be in LA next month. I can hardly wait to see you again. - [Sasha] Elisabeth, how long do I get you for? Whatever it is, it won't be long enough. But, I'll take what I can get. - [Elisabeth] Sasha, I'll be with you as quickly as I can get there. Touring is exciting, but, I'm counting down the seconds 'til I am wrapped in your arms. - [Brad] Did you see the ass on that new cocktail server? - [Sasha] I think Kristen is still hotter. - [Brad] Kristen, are you joking? I got Tina's number, I'm gonna take her out tomorrow. I'll show you the photos. - You know, I just don't understand how you get these women to let you take pictures of their naked asses? - It's a gift. - If they only knew what can do with them. - Hey, if weren't gonna show the photos I'd just look with my eyes. It's not my fault they're complete idiots. - That's shockingly logical. - Fuck. - What? - You're still thinking about that pianist. Go get yourself a hot little piece and get under it! - Sasha, I thought about making you L1 for the Westlake prom but you'd rather run your mouth than work. (Sasha scoffing) - You know that's bullshit! I work harder than any of these assholes. - Really? Sean and Matt don't think that you can do it. - Seriously? Are you fucking kidding? You know, Matt and Sean, they are so scared of losing gigs that they'll say anything. - I'll book the job, don't make me sorry. Get back to work before I change my mind. - What an asshole. I'm here. (soft music) - [Sasha] I love you. (soft music continues) - [Elisabeth] What's your favorite color? - Black. - [Elisabeth] Black? Whose favorite color is black? - [Sasha] Why, what's yours? - [Elisabeth] Yellow. - [Sasha] I wish you could stay longer. - [Elizabeth] Me too. I'm gonna miss you. I'll be back, I promise. - [Sasha] You better. (somber music) - [Elisabeth] I love you. - [Sasha] Me too. (dramatic music) - [Elisabeth] Dear Sasha, I'll be home in Corsica soon. You should come for a visit. I'd love to show you where I grew up. Talk to you at the same table I used to sit as a kid and dream. Can listen to my mother's recording on the patio under the same stars. - [Sasha] Elisabeth, just hop a flight to France, huh? Okay, maybe I will. I miss you. - [Elisabeth] Sasha, I can't believe you're coming all the way to France to see me. I'll wake up a few weeks from now in a dream I've been having for months. - [Sasha] Elisabeth, maybe it is a dream. Who knows? (plane engine roaring) (dramatic music) - I love it. We can lock it on that bridge in Paris. (Sasha groaning) - Why is day three always a hardest? How do you deal with jet lag all the time? - I don't, you're just never there to see it. - [Sasha] Thank God! I bet you're a baby. (Elisabeth gasping) - Come on, get out of bed, I want to take you to that little cafe in Italy. - No! A little bit longer. - No, for once. - What are you gonna do about it, huh? You better go make some coffee. - Hmm. Move in with me. - In Corsica? (Sasha huffing) And what I'm gonna do in Corsica, huh? - [Elisabeth] Isn't it nice here? - Yes, it is. I have an idea, why don't you move to LA? - LA? - [Sasha] Yes, move to LA with me! - [Elisabeth] Forget I said anything. - We could get a small house in the Hills. - I don't think so. Don't you wanna live in the same country? - Yes, absolutely. I know your schedule, Elisabeth. If I'm here full time, you're not. what am I gonna do, work in a shop? - You could. Why not? - Because I live and work in LA and I love it. - You wouldn't see me. - You are never home. (speaking in foreign language) - Hi Amy! (speaking in foreign language) - Come on, tell her Amy, tell her to move in with me. - You want me to tell my best friend to move 6.000 miles away? I don't think so. - Come on, whose side are you on? - My side and your first. (Sasha groaning) - Selfish. Yeah, I can't win, I'm going back to sleep. - You're not, no, you're not. - [Sasha] Yes. - Stop yelling, I'm gonna make the coffee! (speaking in foreign language) - Sleep. - Yeah. - And I will keep you company. - Play me something. - What you wanna hear? - You know what I wanna hear. (Elisabeth chuckling) (Sasha laughing) (skin slapping) (both laughing) (dramatic music) - [Elisabeth] This is my favorite place to be and I'm here with you. - [Sasha] Did you always want to be a pianist? - [Elisabeth] I wanted to be just like my mother. I wish you could have met her. - [Sasha] Me too. - [Elisabeth] Why lighting? - [Sasha] Because I'm good at it. I like being on my feet, it makes me happy. - [Elisabeth] Are you happy here? - [Sasha] Yes. (dramatic music continues) I love the sea waves crashing a universe beneath. I could never live far from the ocean. - [Elisabeth] There's more than one ocean you know? - [Sasha] Have you really existed this whole time? - [Elisabeth] Yep, the whole time. - [Sasha] What would our lives be if we'd crossed paths sooner? - [Elisabeth] I don't know, it would be like this. - [Sasha] You think? - [Elisabeth] Yeah, of course. - [Sasha] But it can't always be like this, can it? - [Elisabeth] Why not? - [Sasha] Because this is too easy, nothing is this easy. - [Elisabeth] Things are only difficult if you make them difficult. (birds squawking) - [Sasha] Okay then, let's just exist together. - [Elisabeth] Okay. (dramatic music continues) (case clanking) - [Sasha] Elisabeth, I can't believe it's been four months. (somber music) I still remember how it felt to kiss your lips. Corsica feels like a dream now. I miss you. You're late. - [Elisabeth] I know, I'm gonna write a strongly worded letter to this airline. Hello is what make you happy? - Sometimes saying hello is just as hard as saying goodbye. (somber music continues) (plane engine roaring) (dramatic music) Nice dress. - [Elisabeth] Thank God I brought options. - I don't understand why you had to book this for tonight? - I didn't, Michael did. - Do you know what I turned down to spend today with you? - I never told you to turn down the show. - You never told me to, but they offered those dates and I turned them down. - Just a few hours, we have the whole day tomorrow. - We actually don't. You have sound check at four. - I'll leave as quickly as I can. - Gee, thanks. - Sasha, were talking about people who can get me on the biggest stages in the world. - I gave up an ME for the Born This Way tour. Do you know how big that is? - You want me to stay? Fine, I'll stay. - No, I don't want you to stay, if you stay you won't be happy. - If I go, you won't be happy. - [Sasha] Yeah, neither of us can win here. - I won't be too late. (pensive music) (dramatic music) I'm an ass. - You're not an ass. - Yes I am. Nice, but, nothing left but a good ass kicking. - You had a thing, I should understand. I just thought we'd have more time. - I know. What if I tell you that I make it work to be here? No shows, no events, I'm gonna turn off my phone. I'm not even gonna wanna compete on next weekend. (pensive music) You don't look excited. - Like, next weekend, next weekend? - Mm-hmm. - I booked an L1 for E3, remember? - L1, ME, E3, I barely know it means. Can't you just- - Can't what? Are you serious. How 'bout you not book a dinner the only night you're in LA? (pensive music continues) - I'll call Michael and take it back. I just don't know when I'll be back. - This is getting really shitty. - I know. - So, what do you wanna do about it? (soft music) - Are you asking me if I think we should break up? - [Sasha] Yeah, I think I am. - No. No, I don't. (soft music continues) (both laughing) (speaking in foreign language) You think you can get away so easily? - Well, when you're all the way around the world and I barely hear from you, yes. - Don't worry. You're gonna have to deal with me always coming back. (Sasha laughing) (soft music continues) (waves crashing) (dramatic piano music) Mama? (speaking in foreign language) Okay? (speaking in foreign language) Okay? (speaking in foreign language) (soft music) (speaking in foreign language) - Elisabeth. You made it to the top 25. - Oh my God. - Finally, right? - I can't believe it. (Elisabeth screaming) - I have you booked nonstop for the next year. - I need to call Sasha!

(Sasha scoffing) - Took 'em long enough. - [Scott] You're the guy, Sasha. - Hell yeah, I am. - [Scott] Look, don't get too excited. They asked for you, I'll give them what they want, but that doesn't mean I have to. - Do you know how long I'll be waiting for people to realize that Sean is a total dick? - Check your availability. I'll email you the rest of the dates. - Lay it on me Scott. I've only been waiting for this my entire career. (dramatic music) (crowd roaring) Hey, it's Sasha, you know what to do. - [Elisabeth] Sasha, call me back. (dramatic music continues) - [Sasha] Hey, it's Sasha, you know what to do. - [Elisabeth] Sasha, I love you, call me back. (dramatic music continues) (cell phone ringing) - Danny, can you make it sharper? (cell phone vibrating and chiming) Hey. - Can't believe you answered! - It's loud, where are you? - Fine then. - We should not have had that last scotch. - Who's that? - No one, just a friend. - A friend? - Don't be jealous. - I'm not jealous. - Then why do you sound like you're jealous? - Well, I haven't heard your voice in weeks, and when I finally do, you're getting drunk with some woman. - Don't be mad. - I'm not mad, I'm frustrated. (soft music) You know, I hate this, I hate that I don't see you. I hate that our entire relationship is over text right now. - I'll be home in a few days, come see me. - Wish I could, but I can't. - Bullshit, you can't. (speaking in foreign language) - I have shows through the week, I can't. Why don't you come see me? (Elisabeth scoffing) - I'm on the road. (speaking in foreign language) This is stupid. It's very stupid. - Excuse me? - What you're doing is stupid. Come on the road with me, you'll L1 full-time. I'll get you any console you want. And you'll deal with me instead of Scott. I'll treat you better than anyone else, and we both know it. - I thought you understood. - Oh, I don't understand. Sylvia thinks I'll be as big as Alan. - Sylvia, huh? - We'll tour together, we'll be texting, no more scheduling. - If I give up my position I lose it forever. I have worked my ass off for this promotion. - We'll be the inseparable team. For fuck's sake, give in this time! - I have to go program. (phone line beeping) (soft music) Hey, it's Sasha, you know what to do. - [Elisabeth] Sasha, answer! I don't know why I'm apologizing, but, I'm sorry anyway. Call me back. - [Sasha] Hey, it's Sasha, you know what to do. - [Elisabeth] Sasha, how long will you be mad? I miss you. (soft music continues) - Scott! What is up with these kids you book? This is missing the clamps. How difficult is it to put all the pieces in the case? - Sasha, I really think you need some time off. - I don't need time off. I just need competent lighting people. - [Scott] And I need bodies to push cases, Sasha. - What an asshole. - [Sasha] He's not that bad. - I was actually talking about you. - [Sasha] Why are you here? - I was in town. Thought I'd stop by. - [Sasha] You were in town? - You're not answering my texts. I can't even remember what we were fighting about. (Sasha scoffing) You're busy. I should get back to my hotel. - Okay. No, wait, hang on. (dramatic music) - [Elisabeth] Come on, it'll be fun. - [Sasha] I have shows. - [Elisabeth] Can't you make an exception this time? - [Sasha] Oh, I'll think about it. - [Elisabeth] Think about it? I'm getting on a flight tomorrow. - [Sasha] Okay. - [Elisabeth] Okay? - [Sasha] Okay, but under one condition. - [Elisabeth] What? - [Sasha] It's you and me the rest of today and tomorrow. No one, nothing else. - [Elisabeth] Deal. - I mean, I don't do it often, but I've done it. Look, don't ask Scott, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Run one hazer from the catwalk and then put fogger under the drum riser. Yeah, and remember to call the fire department and put the system in test before you run the fogger. Yeah, yeah, keep me posted. Yeah, okay. Hey, you know the password, right? Yeah, okay, good. Okay, bye. You said that you would be 10 minutes. - I know, I'm sorry. The woman from the paper was an idiot. She took forever to get to the point. - So I guess dinner is out the window? - [Elisabeth] We can change our reservation. - In what time zone? Your show starts in three hours. - Well, we might be able to get another reservation if you ever get off your phone. - Oh, because it's my fault? - Why you wanna take over Sean, hmm? - 'Cause Sean is a dick. What if we forget dinner reservation and we go have sex? (knocking on door) - Hey, I need you to talk to this publicist. - [Sasha] Ugh. - Now? - Yes, now, I have her for five minutes before she needs to be somewhere else, I'm sorry. (Elisabeth sighing) - Well, go grab two slices and we'll eat here. - Or, you could blow off the publicist. I did fly all the way to New York last minute to spend time with you. - Okay, I won't talk to the publicist (cell phone ringing) if you turn off your phone. - Oh no, I have to grab that. (Elisabeth groaning) Hey, what? Yeah. - Hey, just one more day. - Yeah, okay, I gotta go. I have to go back to LA. - Of course you do. - Sean is MIA, and if he gets fired, I'm the guy. - Great. It's just the last time I'll see you this year. - I know. What if you skip the Christmas tour, come to LA and we'll have holidays together? - Almost sold out. - The Main Room is too. - Well, that's that. - Mm-hmm. - Can you get mine with mushrooms and spinach? - You have to go. Go. Get out, go, go, oh, nah. (both laughing) Go. (Elisabeth whining) (cell phone ringing) What? (somber music) (plane engine roaring) (somber music continues) (plane engine roaring) (somber music continues) (man softly talking) (somber music continues) (plane engine roaring) (plane engine roaring) (both laughing) (somber music continues) - Okay, well, maybe you were right. You're right. - Mm-hmm. Maybe I missed you a little bit. (somber music continues) And now you've picked up all these tour dates. - [Elisabeth] Maybe New York's only worth second. - Oh, maybe. Can't believe it. You got it back, how? - [Elisabeth] I have my ways. - [Sasha] That's coming off. You broke. (both laughing) (soft music) - [Michael] Elisabeth! - [Sasha] Whoa, hold on. - Whoa. Soundcheck in 15. And Sasha's been - I can't get it on. - looking for S, God, I'm sorry. Scott's been - Hi. - looking for Sasha. I'll see you on stage. (Sasha groaning) - [Sasha] Way to ruin a moment Michael, geez. Geez. - [Elisabeth] You'd better get back. I don't want you to get in trouble. - Scott pretends to hate me, but, he loves me. (soft music) - Come with me to Chicago. - [Sasha] You know I can't. - You're like their guy now, you can do whatever you want. - I think that means I actually can't do whatever I want. - [Elisabeth] Everyone wants you on their show. That won't change if you leave for a few days. (Sasha scoffing) - We're really gonna have this conversation now? Okay, why don't you skip your show? - And how is it gonna look for my new contract if I skip a show? - Well, how's it gonna look if I bail on a tour? Just because I don't have a lawyer between me and my work does not mean I don't have any obligation. (speaking in foreign language) - All I'm saying is he can get out of it. - You know, actually, I can't. Semi full of lights coming in on Wednesday and I'm a tour's contact. - Okay, you're off tomorrow. If you can come to Chicago, come down the highway. - Right, no. Sure, remind me of your schedule tomorrow. - It's a photo shoot, two interviews, a meet and greet, and soundcheck is at four. - Yeah, exactly, I'm not falling for it again. You ask me to spend time and I stand there alone waiting. I don't have time for it anymore. - I'm sick of this argument. - You're the one always peddling this attitude of self-importance. - Me, self-importance? - [Sasha] Mm-hmm. - And what about you? (somber music) Who's even going to be here on Wednesday, The Dave Matthews tribute band? - What does it matter? - All I'm saying is that not every show is a life or death situation. - And yours is? Elisabeth, you play the piano. It's not like you're coming up with a cure for cancer. - Every time I express I wanna spend time with you, you flip out. - You're not asking to spend time. You're asking me to give up everything to run away with you. - And is that such a bad thing? You don't even need this job. I can take care of you. - I do not need to be taken care of. You know what it's taken for me to get this far. - And you act like it was easy for me? - Well, your last name hasn't hurt you. It's not like you've had to- - Get out. - Seriously? - Yeah. Get out. - [Sasha] Seriously? - Yeah. Get out. - Great. Yeah, don't mind me. I'm just the one who makes sure the audience can see you while you play. Or maybe I'll just leave the work lights on and go on a vacation, huh? (soft music) - Oh God. - For fuck's sake, Scott, what is with these kids you book? - I get it, Sasha, you're perfect and everyone else is shit! Noted, written, and taken into consideration. - [Man] Is something wrong, you seem a little bit? - Don't worry about it. - [Elisabeth] What's going on here? - That is none of your business! - [Scott] I don't have time for this shit. - None of my business? And since when are you none of my business? - Since five minutes ago when you told me to get out, I am so out. Move, I'm handling it. - [Elisabeth] I wanted you out of the green room, not out of my life. - Nothing you do makes me think you want me in your life. - I asked you to come with me! - Yeah, you want me to make all the sacrifices. I give up my job, I move my home. You know what, Elisabeth? You were barely in the city for more than a day. (speaking in foreign language) - Do you have any idea how hard I have worked to get here and you want me to give it up like it is nothing? (speaking in foreign language) - I'm tired, I'm so tired, Elisabeth. - What are you saying? - I'm saying that you're like this dream. And then, you know what? I wake up and you're gone! And I realize how much I love this place, this job, this climb. - And me being totally gone will make your life better? - I don't want to do this anymore. I have to wake up! - [Scott] Sasha, consult, now. (speaking in foreign language) Okay. I'm gone. (speaking in foreign language) For each other. - Okay. (somber music) (audience applauding) (somber music continues) (soft piano music) (Sasha sniffling) (soft piano music continues) (dramatic piano music) (speaking in foreign language) (both laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (soft piano music) - [Brad] God, I would motorboat her thighs. Sasha. - Huh? - What are you on, and can I have some? She's good. - [Sasha] Is she? - Yeah, sexy bitch, always wanted to bang a pianist. - [Sasha] Have you? - Yeah, haven't you? Ah shit, I'm sorry, I'm a dick. (somber music) (speaking in foreign language) (pensive music) (pensive music continues) (cell phone vibrating and chiming) - Yeah, what's up? Oh, this couldn't wait 'til I got there? No, fine. Yeah, I'll check the writer now and make it happen. Yeah, okay, fine. Mm-hmm. Dude, I haven't even had coffee yet, can we pick this up when I'm on the clock? Yeah, okay, bye. (soft music) - I love it. - We can lock it on that bridge in Paris. (cell phone vibrating) Christ, Scott. (piano keys chiming) (soft piano music) - You remember. - Of course I remember. Hey. - Hi. - Play me something. (soft piano music) (soft music) Hi. You okay? (soft music continues)
