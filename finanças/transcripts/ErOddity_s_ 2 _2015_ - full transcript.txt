We have entered a realm where teenage boys make new discoveries behind locked bedroom doors. We take you behind these doors and offer you a voyeuristic window into the world of the young and the inexperienced. We'll bring you the slightly odd, we'll show you the highly erotic. We welcome you to ErOddity(s). Did you find him? No. And what about radio? Do you want a cigarette? Adjust it. I thought you were saving that for our last night? Oh god. Where the strong hold somewhere in South America. In just a few moments, two men will be tied at the wrist and left tired and hungry on the hardwood floor. The leader is Joseph Sargent. He and his subordinate, Micah, will be left here to savor their final moments together. Their meeting with the drug lord they were hired to kill will surely be their last. As for Micah, his service is about to come to an end, but for Joseph, his own private war is only just beginning. His secrets, past and present, are on a collision force that would thrust him head first into a world of eroddity(s). A Big Deal O'Neil here and I will make you a big Texas-size deal in a New York City mill. Oh, fuck New York. What the hell do they have? Lucky here we got a 1997 Dodge Charger over here and... We're in a fine fucking mess, aren't we? He speaks. I only speak when I have something to say. His server is talking about Fernando. He gave us up, that's all I know. He's messed the radio and took our ammo. I had a bad feeling from the very beginning when the Miguel put a new team together so quickly. I'm sorry. I have no complaints with you. However, you don't look much like a mercenary. I'm not. Then where did Miguel find you? He saw me shooting at a rifle range I go to every morning. I don't know, I guess, he liked what he saw. He came back the next day and offered me the job. Just like that? Just like that. Damn it, that little Mexican could be very persuasive. It's like his wallet. One minute, I'm a computer store nerd and gun enthusiast. The next, I'm in some South American jungle trying to kill a drug lord. It's a strange world. Why do they call him L2 Blow anyway? When they take you, you get the name part. They call him that because he takes an anti-cigar tube, he fills it with gasoline, seals one end with a small fuse and then shoves it up the ass of his enemy. Huh. He then sits back with a good Cuban while the guy just sweats it out and when he's done with his cigar, he'll bring it up to the guy's ass, brings a new meaning to the term fire in the hole. Huh, the guy burns from the inside out. Oh god. No, don't worry. He'll probably just shoot you. Now, I'm going to tell on me. He's a busy man. How many cigars can you smoke in an hour? Oh, I'm sorry, baby. Hmm, what's that? Nothing. Uh, do you think Fernando worked for them all along? I only know one thing about the guy and that's he's a big fucking asshole. I only met him the night we arrived. He was drinking and he got obnoxious. I just wanted to hit him. Did you? No. Well, something must have happened. Well, believe me it will. If he thinks he can get away with this, he's mistaken. The cartel will never trust a traitor, especially an American. Don't worry we'll soon all be on the same boat to hell. I commend you for your action. It was right of you to turn in your friends. Now, we want you to stay in your room. Soon, someone will be there to give you your reward. He'll love the cigarette too and gas staying up on his ass. Somehow I think it's too late for that. Someone's coming. Hey, we're thirsty. Can we get something to drink? He said we can... I get the gist. Tell me about your home. Is there anyone waiting for you? I'm married. Huh, really? What is her name? Do you have kids? His name is Austin. I guess you'll never know about a person. Tell me about him. Austin is a free spirit and an amazing kid. I'd know it. He has no family? I mean no one he speaks of. He's got a crazy ass cousin that keeps an eye on him, but he's only a few years older but more like friends. Does he work? It's hard for him to find meaningful work in a small town we live in. Work's work. Maybe he's just lazy. He's not lazy. He's deaf. Hey, thanks for waiting for me. Right back at you kid. Oh, why the hell am I even here for that little piece of shit? Why would he do this to us? Hey, asshole, we're still thirsty over here. Oh, I think I'm about to throw up. Calm down. It could have been worse. He could've taken that... Don't even say. Tell me about Austin. How do you two communicate? Uh, we sign. Did you know it or did you have to learn it? No, I know it. Huh, in addition to the six languages, that's impressive. Tell me more about him. What? I told you he's bit of a free spirit. What? Oh, Austin has a certain level of difficulty keeping out of trouble. If it's there to be found, he's a master of finding it. FeI'm getting tired of waiting, Eddie, just make the fucking deal. I'll fire your ass. Love you. What the -- you've got to be kidding me. I'm ready this time you little skank. Say hello to my little friend. It'll be loaded next time you little shit. I hate to say it but he kind of reminded me of myself when I was a kid. Uh, I can't wait. I'm never going to see him again. You'll never know what happened to... If you will, you know, amigo, I wish, not like you, I'm perfectly here, here to offer my services to whoever needs them at that time and whoever is willing to pay the most. Who are you and why are you here? Oh, my name is Ricardo Fuentes, amigo, and I'm here to make sure the two of you are kept well so that they'll do can break you in dos. How good of you. Ah, that's the line of business I'm in, my friend, hospitality. Did you two piss yourselves? No, that asshole guard used our faces as a urinal. Oh, well, I guess, that's why the Americanos call the washroom the head, no? Okay, it's a bad joke, okay, so wait here. We're not going anywhere. Come on. Let's go. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not be crazy, okay, I've got a gun and I'm very good with it. What are we doing? Oh, what are you doing? Well, let's talk while taking off your calzoncillos. Let's go. Okay, that's nice, that's nice. Okay, we're going to take a shower. Let's go. Use the soap, okay. Don't worry it's only gay if there's no gunpoint. Amigos, don't worry. Okay. Okay, that's it, let's go. You're done. What are we supposed to wear? You can wear the towels. What's wrong? Yours is bigger than mine. That is not something you want the senyoritas to hear. Mine's too small. That is another one. Now, come on, I have something to give you. Don't worry. I'm not going to tie you up. You just need to behave until the duo comes tomorrow morning and to help you behave, there is no phone service, there's no TV, no internet, the bars on all the windows inside and outside and we are five stories up. Oh, and not to mention, there are two guards on the roof and the electricity goes out at 11. That's a beautiful moon. That may be all the light you need tonight. On that note, I say good night. Since, escape is impossible, I'd recommend you'd be taking this time to square things with the man upstairs, but if it's pleasure you seek, maybe you can find comfort in each other. Only the angels will know and they know how to keep a secret. Good night. I am so sorry for your position. What just happened? I have no idea. What did he mean by seeking comfort in each other? I think he made himself clear. It would be weird, wouldn't it, if something happen between us? It would. Do you want it to? I have a wife. Oh, I didn't know, I'm sorry. I bet she's beautiful. She is. And I'm sure she wouldn't want you to spend your last night alone. What do you mean out of that? What about Austin? Um, this is our last night, Joseph. Austin's in my heart, but we have other needs tonight. Was that your first time with a man? You don't have to answer that. What happens in college stays in college, right? I'd give anything not to be here tonight. With the way things are, I'm glad I'm here with you. Once again, you're silent. Tell me what you're thinking. I'm just thinking about being unfaithful to my wife. I don't think... I, I, I'm not complaining. I'm just thinking about it, that's all. Do you think your wife is being faithful to you? I have no reason to believe otherwise. What about yours? He's 18. Did I mention he had a crazy ass cousin? Stop. Don't tell me they're kissing cousins? They do a lot more than just kiss. And you condone this? It's a small town. And you condone it? They're fun to watch. Whatever floats your boat partner. Whatever floats your boat. Buenas diaz, amigo. Where's your kumpadre? In the bathroom. Well, that's too bad. I'm a little pressed for time, so you're going to have to tell him the good news. What good news? You're free to go. And two holes no more. What? What, what do you mean? There was not a hitching? Si. Me. You said you were good with a gun. Yes, amigo, but on this case, I gave him a little taste of his own medicine. Oh but, how would you, how did you do... Amigo, look, I can't talk, okay, I'm a little pressed for time. I need to go, you need to go, we need to go. Look, there's a hotel down the street, there should be a team coup of Americanos there, I am sure you can find that ride. Okay, good bye my friend and good luck to you and your amigo. Ricardo, gracias. Are you all right? Joseph? He was an assassin all along. What? An assassin? Are you shitting me? Did he, did he kill the bastard? Yes. He said the Americans are coming soon. Uh, oh my god, I can't believe that we're ever going home. Yes. How can you be so stoic at a time like this? I never thought this could've happened. Joseph, how can we handle last night? I mean, talk to me, it's important. I don't know what you're talking about. Nothing happened last night. That's the way it has to be. Last night happened whether you want to admit it to yourself or not. Quit lying to yourself, Joseph. I know it wasn't your first time either. Well, it will be the last. I wont betray my family. You betray your family by betraying yourself. Come on, let's go. You'll never see me again. Micah. What. You're right. I'm sorry. I have been with a man before. Then, why did you marry your wife? It felt like the right thing to do. You mean it's the safe thing to do, wasn't it? It was. Now, I know if we could've met then, things would've been a lot different. Well, I'm here now. And Joseph, whatever happens, we'll work it out, I promise. I know we will. FeIt's okay. It happens. You've been under a lot of stress. We have tomorrow and the next day and the rest of our lives. Hey, why don't you go take a hot shower, it might relax you. I'm going to go to bed now to be up early. Welcome home, baby. Joey. Hold on back there, we'll get you as far as Mexico. They said there were two of you. My friend didn't make it. I just wanted to hit him. Did you? No. Then, something must have happened. Whoa. You've been a bad boy suddenly. Joseph Sargent's private war has only just begun. He has caused collateral damage to those known and unknown to him. His actions on the spat of what we call life will forever keep him a prisoner as Joseph himself becomes just another casualty of a darker side of ErOddity(s). I realize now, the most important thing in a relationship is trust. Jet plane flight 1417, departed on schedule at expected arrival time of 4:35 PM. In less than three hours, we'll be together. Two hours after that, we'll be together forever. And from this day forward, I'll never cheat on you again. Even if some southern twink couldn't know any better came knocking at my door, I'd save myself for you. I love... Yes? Howdy, I'm here for the audition. Thank you. Sorry I'm late. My doctor appointment went a little later than expected. You need my headshot? I have a photographic memory. Oh, okay. Ready? Whenever you are. Howdy. That's enough. What? Why don't you go ahead and take off your clothes now? Excuse me? Undress. Start from the top and work your way down. I don't think this part calls for nudity. Life's full of surprises. Hey, thanks for the audition. Oh, you know you have room 118 written on the casting call? It'll be known. Sorry about that. No worries. Impressive. My girlfriend doesn't have any complaints. Are you straight? Well, I hide it to you? So, do I get the part? That depends on how badly you want it. Is this what you call a casting couch? We can start on the couch and work our way on the bed. There's something I should probably tell you. I know. You're straight. But... Good thing for you, I'm a bottom. A what? This isn't so bad, is it? Do I get the part? How the fuck should I know? The audition's in the next room. Stupid little Texas twink. Yeah, he insists that I sign the pre-nup, so, I know, I know. He says people need to be cautious before jumping into things. It's the opportunity of a lifetime. I'm not going to mess it up by not signing something that can be challenged later anyway. Good bye. I'm getting married to a very generous silver cowboy. Congratulations. Good luck with your acting career. Good luck with your next check-up. There's something I should probably tell you. And from this day forward, I'll never cheat on you again. La vida está llena de sorpresas. VER TIEMPOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS Somebody's got some explaining to do. His new husband might be a tad sore about the situation, not nearly as sore as some of the victims on our next film about a caretaker with an unusual habit. There he is. Garret, turn yourself in, there's nowhere to go. He's jumping the fence. Ahh. I think he's hit. Jeffrey, stay with Dennis and call an ambulance. The man behind the mask is 31-year old Garret Garken. Both mentally and physically scarred for life, this caretaker of Cook County will soon embark on a journey from which there is no return. I think I see something by the playground. Forty-eight hours from now, this desperate man will make the final effort to obtain what he most desires, but in doing so, he'll learn something about himself he wished he hadn't, for Garret Garkin is about to take a one way plunge into the world of ErOddity(s). Where's he going? What is he up to? Mother, come away from the window and leave that poor boy alone. He's up to something, I tell you. I would hope so or he'd be a customer not an employee. Uh, don't you have any homework to do? No, I graduated from college last year. Then go read your Bible. Yes, mother. Ready to go home? Almost. I just can't believe he's gone. It was only a matter of time for this one. He was always so goddamn wreckless. We all were. Not anymore, right? I'm ready. Are you boys hungry? I just want to go lie down. Well, then I see leftovers in your future. Watch your head. What are we having? Whatever Dennis wants. Come on, I'm the husband. Good, cause you're buying. Thank you very much. You're welcome very much. Hmm. Come in. I just came to see if you need anything. I'm good, thank you. Mind if I turn on the light? Knock yourself out. It's cold in here. Do you mind if I close the window? I didn't realize it was open. Is there anything you'd like? My vision? I wish I could give that too, Dennis. I saved you some food for when you get hungry. It's in the fridge. Hey, there. Hey. How was your job? Oh, I was up finding that (inaudible) again. Did you have your spray? To hell with that spray, I'm going to shoot that son of a bitch. How are you? How's Dennis? I think I embarrassed him. Embarrassed? What did you do? Something I shouldn't have. If you're thinking about a blowjob from the sister-in-law is nothing to be embarrassed about. Would you be serious? I walked in on him naked. Oh, god, I'm sorry. I'm not looking. I'll turn off the light. I'm not worried, Kelly. Great. I just want you to know, if you ever need anyone to talk to, to yell at, scream at, I don't care, I'm here for you. Anyway, I just want you to know that. Oh, lucky you, two west boys for the price of one, huh? See anything you like? Done be obscene. I wasn't looking. You're always looking. I'm always observing. There's a difference. Did you know your brother had another tattoo? No, where is it? On the back of his thigh. Umm, what does it say? You don't want to know. There's an arrow pointing to his ass with words "Heavens above." Ugh. Okay, you're right, I didn't want to know that. I told you. Anyway, I'm worried about him. He's been acting strange lately. Dennis has always been a little odd, you know this. Did he say anything? Kelly, tell Darren that he doesn't have to worry about me. It will all be over soon. What will be over? All of the bad things. All right. Well, that sounds really optimistic to me. I know he's been in a deep depression lately but Dr. Xavier says he's slowly coming out of it. He's seeing improvements with every session. I hope so. He was Benny's doctor too, you know. Benny was a fucking idiot. Hmm, comes know better. Stop, you're getting me all wet. I hope so. This is going to be a rough go. I know but it's going to be a no (inaudible). Oh yeah? Stop. Do you really think he'll pull through? I do. And you know what, I love how much you care about him. How do you not care about the sexy ass boys even if they do have a one-track mind? Um. Do you think I should get a tattoo on my thigh like my brother's? No way. Two locations only specific, because where I'm sitting, heaven is below. Um, I love the way your mind works. Shit. Now, what? FeSheriff, there's been a call about teenagers camping in the park. Mother. You turn on that switch and I'll let your girlfriend of yours know that you wet the bed all through high school. Really, mother? Pfff. Let me explain this. I never want to see you again. Sorry for the late call, Julia, you see I kind of wanted to tell you something before mom did. This is awkward, um, well... Are you going to bed? Yes, mother. Did the Morrison woman ever arrive? This afternoon. I wish they'd take their business elsewhere, those damn nudists. What! Uh! Bitch! It's starting to get cold. I wish I'd brought some alcohol. Sweet. Where did you get it? From your parents' liquor cabinet. Fuck. And they're really invested by your locks. That's all I've got to say. So have you talked to Dennis lately? I saw him at the funeral. He didn't look so good. Well, what do you expect? First his best friend kills himself then calls and chokes on his own barf, I mean, what the fuck is up with that? I don't know. Let's get this place started. I thought we already did. Oh, okay. But we're not doing it outside. Absolutely. What's the sense of having a tent? Fine. Oh, don't forget the vodka. Uh, what happened? That was so fucking amazing. Yes, it was. Huh? Aaaah! I should know, me and Julia had been serious for quite some time now. So much in fact that even the subject of premarital sex has come up. She doesn't want it? Oh, no, no, no. She, she wants it. So much in fact, she's even let me touch her. Boobies, they didn't look anything like these, oh? What? Nothing. I was going to say I'm ready to explore the subject of, you know, but I don't know if Julia's ready and mom even knew she'd let me touch her... Jeffrey, all the girls let their boyfriends touch them. Really? Do they let them put cold bottles in their vagina? It sounds like she's more than ready, Jeffrey. The question is are you man enough to stand up to your mom. Who's here? Service doesn't start for three more hours. I'll check. It's the sheriff. Mrs. Helgenfeld? Mrs. Helgenfeld. Hi, Jeffrey. Hi, Sheriff West. Mrs. Helgenfeld? Mrs. Helgenfeld is not here. Hello, Garret. Well, well, well. This is what all the fuss is about? I was wondering why they wanted two extra deputies. This place is going to be packed. And I'll bet Mrs. Helgrambell's going to be quite pleased. Huh, sad. She's a beautiful young woman. Anyway, I just dropped by to talk about the arrangements. Uh, will you let her know I was in? I will. All right. It's good to see you. You too, Sheriff West. Garret, you know my name. I've been meaning to talk to you. I'd like to ask your permission to see Dennis. Hoooh. I just want to talk to him, just one... I don't see what good talking to him would do. You both just need to move on. You need to forgive and forget. Forget? Like how you did with me? I never forgot about you Garret. And I never tried to hide what we did that night. My wife knows everything. That's where I was at the time. I'm not embarrassed by it. You're only embarrassed it was with me. That's not true. Then, why did you ignore me? I didn't. I changed and you couldn't accept that. I was lying to myself, Garret. Straight men can come out of the same closet. What does that even mean? I don't know. It sounded better in my head. And then, it was Dennis. 16 years old at the time? What the hell were you thinking? It was consensual. It was wrong and you know it. And because of you, my brother lost his sight. Because of him, I lost my face and my life. Sorry about the way things turned out, but I don't see what good talking about it would do now. It would give us closure. I'd want that. I know he does too. We deserve it. I'll come by tomorrow morning with his answer. Thank you. Come in. What's up? I ran into Garret today, we had a nice long talk and he says he wants to see you. Me? Why does he want to see me? Uh, he says he wants closure. I didn't think it would be a good idea, but... I want to see him. What would seeing him after all this time accomplish? Like he said, closure, for both of us to move on. Okay, um, I'll see if he's available to come over one of these nights. How about tomorrow? Can't do it tomorrow. I have a meeting but I'll see if he'll come over soon. I don't care. I don't care what my friends say. If Benny and Colin can't handle us being together, then they're immature assholes. Benny and Colin hate me. They think I'm too old for you. I mean, look at me, they're right. Age is only a number and I find nothing wrong with the number 30. It's the number 17 that's the issue here. Huh, it's my decision. Besides, we haven't even had sex yet. We're taking it slow, we're being smart about this, but it's my life. So, when I'm ready, I want you to be my first. Colin and Benny can go fuck themselves, my brother too. Speaking of which, he's going to be home in about an hour. So, quit wasting my time, bitch. Dennis. What? I just wanted to tell you something... Uh-hmm. About your brother. I just want to get it out in the open. We used to be lovers. What? It was a long time ago. You used to see Darren? You fucked my brother and you're telling me this now? Right, I didn't want you to find out later and have him get in the way of our future. Future? Wait a minute. You're the person he left, for Kelly? And that's why you wanted me to wear my brother's uniform. You sick fuck! Dennis. Get out of my room. Let me explain this. Get the fuck out of my room. I want to see you. I never want to see you again. Dennis. Oh my god, Dennis. Dennis. Darren? Morning. Morning. Are you having problems with your car? It won't start. Dead batteries or something? You want a jump? No, it's the starter. I need to go home and call the tow truck. Listen, Garret, I wanted to talk to you about our conversation yesterday. I want to let you know I'm not ashamed about what we did in the past, hand to God, I'm not. But I did lie to you about ignoring you. I did. It's not because I don't care about you. It's because I was afraid. You know when I came out, man, everyone in the brother welcomed me to the fold but the road to Kansas, man, that's a road less travelled. My family treated me like I just got out of prison, my straight friends treated me like I was a recovering alcoholic and at church they wanted to hang a sign around my neck making me uncomfortable. Listen, I'm sorry about your troubles but I've got to call a tow truck and I've got a lot of work to do. Did you talk to Dennis? Yeah, I did. And? Yeah, I'm afraid he doesn't want to see you, man, I'm sorry. I'll ask you to leave it alone. I'll contact you if he changes his mind but I wouldn't count on it. Good luck with your car. Good luck keeping us apart. How dare you judge me? You have no idea how I met your sweet little brother. It was he who found me, he and his fucking little friend. I'm going to take a shower. Whatever you say, sexy. He and Jason came to scam me. I let Dennis go. I buried his friend alive. It was he who came to me. Who is it? It's Dennis. May I come in? I'm sorry, yeah, of course, come in. Okay. Just call me and let me know when you want me to come get you, okay? I will, bye. Try to head to your right. Thanks. Mrs. Helgenfeld? It's Kelly. Can you do me a favor? Why are you here? Your brother told me... My brother lied to you. He didn't want me to see you. Why would he do that? It doesn't matter. I'm here. I'm glad. I just wanted to tell you that I don't blame you for what happened to my room that day. And I hope you can forgive me for what happened in the park. But what the hell were you doing in the bushes? What the hell were you doing driving a car? Colin, I know what we can do tonight. What? Let's go tear up the park. The park? What the fuck? Let's go cruising. Cruising in the park, man, on a Saturday? Yeah, man, it'll be great. We'll put Dennis behind the wheel. Dennis behind the wheel? Yeah. Huh, okay man, I'm down. Colin and Benny thought it'd be funny to see a blind guy drive a car. I should never have let them talk me into that. Well, they both paid for it. Don't say that, don't ever say that. We all did. Huh, I guess none of our lives went as we planned. Plans? They say if you want to make God laugh, try to make one. It doesn't have to end like this. We can still be together. What? Blind boy and hood man? Sounds like a bad comic book. I'm willing to try. Listen, Garret, I don't mean to hurt your feelings. I think we started our relationship off on the right foot. We weighed all the obstacles and decided it was worth it and then, God laughed and now we must face reality. I face reality every time I look at myself in the mirror. And so do I when I can't. Do you still have the mosaic? Yes. And did you ever finish it? No. Why not? You had a change in direction. Never done this before, take my clothes off for a stranger. Well, there it goes. Hmm, you found someone more photogenic. No. You used to love modeling for me. What's not to love? Being naked and worshipped by the lens? And the photographer. Would you like to photograph me now? I would like that very much. How do you want me? I'm sorry? What I mean is clothes on or clothes off? Wow, I must not be as desirable as I used to be. Clothes off. Did you know the West boy out there? The sheriff? No, his brother. The sheriff's wife called and asked to keep an eye out. I wonder what they're up to. Mom, I'm pretty sure they're talking things over. I mean, they both have a lot to get off their chests. I thought you were going out? Hush your mouth child. If they're just talking, then why haven't I seen flash lights for the past five minutes? Well, Garret's hobby is photography. He's a real artist I hear. They better not be running around naked that's all I have to say. That's the art. That's their business. Oh, really? Why are you always sticking up for that boy? And what's he hiding behind that mask? People just ought to love themselves for who they are. Indeed. Are we done? Yes. Can I get dressed now? No. What? I want you to touch me. Are you naked? Yes. That's not very professional of you. As desirable as you may be, my brother could put you in jail for a long time for taking advantage of an innocent model. I'd stood my life in your brother's jail for one night with you. No, Garret. Let's stop before it's too late. No, it isn't. I want you. Only you can make me whole again. No, Garret. What's the point? I want to fuck you; that's the point. You're hurting me. Okay, go ahead, go ahead. Do it. Do it. But I never thought it would be like this. I never thought you could do this to me. I'm sorry. I put you in this position. I should've never fucking come here. I'm such a fucking idiot. Can you ever forget this happened? No, but I forgive you and I never want you to come near me again. Got it. Okay, okay. Where's my phone? I need to call Kelly. Please, please let me take you home. I mean I know I shouldn't ask you that but it'll be one thing and everything would look okay if I take you home. For me? You'll never have to see me again, I promise. Okay, fine. Where's your car? It's in the cemetery. Yes, I think it's out too, my son finding ways to reason. He's checking on them now. Well, like me, he hates to pry. He went on the preempts of asking if the double cops could arrive. Yes, for all the good hire. I know, poor thing, totally embarrassing. They could literally fit in the oven. Mother. I got to go, Mildred, my son's calling. Mother. What's happening? They're gone. Who's gone? They are. Well, where are they? I, I don't know. But, I found these, but I probably shouldn't show you, I mean, they're not proper. Uh, for heaven's sake. I've had a husband, a son, I've seen it all. Uh, oh, what kind of man does such a thing? I'm just going to get the keys. Garret? I just remembered my brother is saying something about your car breaking down. You had to have it towed this morning. Garret? Are you there? Garret? Mother, there's more. I found this on his night stand. Well, maybe there is some good in him after all. Not exactly. See, it's been hollowed out. You're not going to like what you're going to see. Huh, my god! Uh! No one must ever know about this, not even the sheriff. We have to call him. We could lose our license. Garret has Dennis. Call him. I'm sorry I had to hurt you but I did it so we could be together. Please understand. I have to go but I'll be back soon. Nothing can keep us apart. There he is. Garret, turn yourself in, there's nowhere to go. He's jumping the fence. I think he's hit. Jeffrey, stay with Dennis and call an ambulance. I think I see something by the playground. Uh, thank God he's gone. Yeah, about raping those dead guys, what's up with that? Seriously, he even killed some of them before he did it. Yeah, I'm just glad I don't have to worry anymore. What? That's what I said, me. Yeah, I was worried, okay. Bitch, who'd want to rape your skinky ass? I gave you a chance but you rejected me. You made me do this and I'm sorry it had to be this way but nothing is going to keep us apart, believe me there are those that have tried. Never done this before, take my clothes off for a stranger. Well, here it goes. Tristan asked me to take provocative pictures of him in the hopes of gaining the attention of a young man. I was obliged until I found out that the young man was you. Let's just say that his modeling career came to a tragic end. I would dig you up from the ground if I had to. We will be together and we'll be one always. I'm sorry about your friend. Thank God this night is over. Your brother and I will be meeting with Mrs. Helgenfeld and the reporter. We'll be in the house. Do you think you'll be okay? Yes. Mrs Helgenfeld is looking forward to having you come work here. But they want you to take your time and get better first. Hey, um, uh, the reporter's here, so, yeah. Sheriff, the doctor's able to take anything that would suggest he would turn out to be a serial killer not to mention a necrophiliac? No. And the killing came about towards the end. Until then the victims came by way of his profession. Garret suffered from depression. It started with the break-up of a relationship. Do we have a name? He never said. His relationship problems went from bad to worse when he met a hustler operating at a hotel. Jason Chadwick. Before it was all over, something happened that would shape the future serial killer. I'm going to take a shower. Whatever you say, sexy. Only he stood in the bathroom until the drug he slipped in Garret's drink took effect. The reports say he used Rehipnol? Correct, it would become Garret's drug of choice. I thought we'd have a drink before dinner. Since sexual activity was a given, I assume robbery was the motive? Yes, only it wasn't Garret going into that being robbed. Garret was an artist with keen observational skills. He saw the powder being poured into his drink. It also didn't hurt that Jason wasn't the sharpest tool in the tool shed. That's when Jason's accomplice who had been hiding in the next room made a run for it. He never made it to the door. The accomplice was your brother, Dennis. But there were never any charges filed against him. And the boy has seen the error of his ways. The two started dating for a while, correct? Until Garret got hit by the car that Dennis was driving. That's when things really went bad for Garret. His artistic motives turned deadly, not at first. It was more about beauty. If he can no longer have it, he would take it from others or at least in his mind he would, as he continued to digress, that's when it became more about power and control. And what more control can you have over a person than when you're no longer alive? He was now killing just for sex? And in the case of Colin and Benny, for revenge. Good bye, Benny. Ah. How can a man think so low and be capable of such depravity? I asked Dr. Xavier the same thing. He said it's no mystery and not as difficult as it seems with the right combination of anger and lust, hatred, any man is capable of being driven over the edge. Add to this trauma and stress, it no longer becomes a question of will he but rather a question of when. Uh. This is Cory Tyndall, signing out. Until next time, good night from ErOddity(s).
