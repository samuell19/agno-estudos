They're dead. - No, they're just sleeping. l think they're dead. You can't bring Charlotte here. Whatever were you thinking of? - She's looking forward to your vacation. I'm still working. She wanted to see where you work. And what can she see here? What's she doing there? She can come straight here. Don't you want to get back to work? - I'm doing fine without all this. Look, there's air coming out. How was the night? Did you get any sleep? - A bit. By the way, I got the tiles. I think they're quite nice... I already explained the Marcumar leaflet to him yesterday. They're just worried. I'd be too if I had an embolism. Is it stuck again? Here. From our garden. Thanks. I'll take it inside. And how's it going? - Well... Nico has to take blood thinner Marcumar. And has to wear stockings... tights. - Compression stockings. WINDOWS ON MONDAY Are you sure you don't want anything? A beer? - No. Nathalie will calm down. Who breaks up because of one mistake? It wasn't just one. I should've stayed in Berlin. Yeah, maybe. Do you really love her? Sure. What? I don't know if I should send this. - Let's see. Why don't you call her? What are you doing? - Trust me. No. - Yes. I'll send it, okay? - No way! Do you trust me or not? - Of course not! You're kidding, aren't you? - Of course. This is much better. Nathalie isn't stupid. Then call her. Why should it happen again? The usual. Some girl at the office. Okay, then I'll hand in my notice. I don't know... I only know that I love you. I don't want to lose you. Oh God, what a slime-ball! I want to see you. Sleep well. I think that was it. Charlotte, please... Arms up! Help me. Do the rest by yourself. So, what do you think? Don't you want to wake him? What for? Don't step on that. What are you doing? Get dressed first! I'd put a carpet there. More white perhaps? Hm, nice... Come on... Take that off. - No. I think I'll go to the house anyway. You won't survive all alone. - Yes, I will. I have to change something. - Are you going into detox? Only cows, horses, sheep and no fucking women. How long are you going to hold out? - We'll see. Daddy! So what do you think of all this? - Nice. It's good. You can help me. - Where have you been? At the building supplies store. He's on detox. With horses and sheep... And cows... And toads and frogs and... Mice and shrews... And... Pets and pigs and... Partridges. Are there partridges there? Frieder? And dogs. No, there aren't any dogs. But I want a dog. I promised them. Then they picked out that stupid color at parents' evening. Can I have some too? Cheers then. Daddy's snoring. - Yes, come on. Do I snore too? - Yes, sometimes... You get back to sleep now, okay? When are we picking him up? You'll have to ask Daddy. - He promised. Sleep well. What? Why don't you take this stuff? I still haven't had my period. How late are you? It'll be alright. I've got a funny feeling, though. Do a test. Then we'll know. There's a bit of a problem. The new ones are coming on Monday. Doesn't one normally do that in the summer? I don't know. Looks like you've done quite a lot in the last two weeks. But you're getting someone to do this? - No, Frieder's doing it. Without a plumber? - You sound like an interrogator. Just let them do it. Nice. Nice. - Yes, you can sleep well here. Say something. - I can't. Say something. - I can't. Nina? Where are you? - Here, as you can see. I'm sorry. That took forever. Oh, that's disgusting... I really have to go to the dentist. - That's true. Looks terrible. You're finally on vacation and you send her away? - She wanted to see Trotsky. I don't think water's going to help. Really? - No, I don't think so... Oh shit. Hey, that's great. Maybe try just pulling it off. That's great, you're much faster than I am. I heard you can just put espresso into the paint. Gives it a warmer shade. I want to try that out tomorrow. I'm going to fetch Charlotte. - Now? You wanted me to. In the car. Nothing. I was going to. I could have, but I didn't. I don't know. I'm not coming back. Nathalie. What a surprise. How nice. Are you well? How nice. I don't believe it. Great. Where are the others? - At home. What? Well... Christoph said you passed your exams. - Yes, I got my degree. What are you doing now? - The same as before. An internship? In the parliament? Nina had a politician on the operating table recently. - Who? They're all the same. - With the others, we'd be in Iraq now. That's the only difference. - You're the expert. Okay, what else have they done? They passed 221 laws in the past two years. So? - A few things have changed, but of course people like you don't notice the difference. And I thought I had to come look after my lonely brother. Want some more? - No thanks, I've had enough. I haven't smoked pot since Berlin. - That's your problem. Am I that tense? Now I'm even stealing your boyfriend. Christoph can't stand it for long anyway, with just the two of us. We can share him. Group sex. Do you want a sweetie? - No. Why don't you answer that? I don't want to be yelled at. He'll calm down. Everyone calms down. Nathalie? Blood pressure. She's miles away! Give me a hand. Boy, is she heavy! What are you doing? How is she? - She's okay again, I think. And what's up with you two now? - Can't you tell? Do you think we make a good couple? - No. What a stupid question. Do you think Frieder and I make a good couple? - Yes. It's not going so well, is it? It's alright. That's reassuring. And how often? There are times when there's not much going on. And how long do they last? - Weeks, sometimes months. That's tough. I don't really mind. Frieder doesn't either. He can take care of himself. Sure... don't you? Rarely. Last week I picked Charlotte up from the cr?che and thought, why don't I take Lenny or Anton or Lisa instead. Because they have shitty names. I might be pregnant. Orders from above. Mom? He was so bored alone with our parents. - Didn't you have any friends here? No, not really. Once we went to the village disco and Chrissi smooched with this girl. The next day she was at the door. I was to say he wasn't there, but my dad had already let her in. Chriss went out with her for a few days because he didn't know how to ditch her. So not much has changed since then. Did he tell you anything? Yes. - And what? Well... - What did he tell you? About his women. Yuck, too sweet! - Go get your own then. I'm not here. Actually yes... It's Frieder. I can't find her right now, looks like she's gone out. For a walk, I think. She's really not here. Try her mobile. No, not really. But you know what she's like. No, it's nice here. You should come by sometime. Yes, do that. Okay. See you then, bye. That was really shitty! What? Why did you invite him? It was hypothetical. Don't force me to lie then. - Did I say anything? Did that have anything to do with me? - No. So it did, then. - No! Sorry. What are you doing in there? I got lost. Bacon and eggs, light brown toast... and a Bloody Mary. That arrogant bastard! I'll kill him if he continues. Where is he? - In his room, I think. Won't he open the door? Where were you? We were on our way to the police. Couldn't you have called? What? - That obviously won't work. And what should l do? - Don't accelerate so much. Where have you been? - Down there. Where did you sleep? Can you sit on the hood? We need a bit more weight. Very funny. There you go. l'll get it for you. What shall I do about the fire? - Just let it burn out. Come on, sweetie. Wait here. We're going home in a minute. You leave her waiting and disappear. Didn't t cross your mind we could think you were dead? I'm talking to you! Are you drunk? So you're not pregnant, then? Are you coming home with us? What about the car? I can't drive in this condition. Do I bore you? I'll be half an hour. I just have to fit some windows. You can continue or have a quick break. It's almost the same. Look. We could also give it a darker varnish... For free. Is it pine? You didn't want meranti. We don't like it either. That leaves only plastic or pine. And Oregon pine. And now? Mr. Buchner? Is she asleep? I thought I heard something. The pregnancy hasn't changed you much at all. Why did we split up anyway? You split up with me. - Really? And why? Do you do this often? What? Sleep with other women. This is the first time. - Really? Really. You already know everything. You smoke like a non-smoker thinks a smoker smokes. Okay? - Yes. Over there. To the right. Goodnight. But I wanted to take you home. Sleep well. You're up early. It's already late. But you have the day off. I want to go to the cr?che. Why don't we play truant? - Cr?che. Want to visit Trotsky? - Cr?che. How's it going? - Not too good. Mr. Zander! What's...? Nico... I'm terribly sorry. How did it...? With his bike. - Bike? What's that? Nico has died. - That's what it says? Do you really want to go to the cr?che? Are you okay? Are we going out today? - Sure, if it doesn't rain. We're going out. Don't worry. I can handle it. I'm not sure if I can handle it. I'll call you. You can't put up with that. I'll talk to Josef. Dad, Josef is a divorce lawyer. - Josef is a lawyer. Period. He can take care of a carpenter. I don't want him to take care of anyone, I just want the windows I ordered. And how are you going to do that? Was the pine really that bad? I'll talk to Josef. Do you want to come home with us? Aren't you hungry? I can't leave the house. We'll take Charlotte, okay? Shall I talk to Nina? It's me. Who's me? Frieder. What do you want? Maria. Nice tent. Where have you hidden Charlotte? At my parents'. I was at Maria's. I didn't ask. I want to be with her. I'm going to bed. Can we order the next one? - Yes, we can order the next one. It's an acute abdomen from C15. Get the anesthetist to say how much time they need. - No problem. I'll just stitch up this lung, then we'll do a water test... Wow, your suit! You look good. Are you getting changed? We have to go. Could you go alone? No, we'll do this together. You can't not go. You really can't. Do you think they'd even notice? - Of course. They've drummed up half the town. And now? I don't understand why they couldn't cope with the Marcumar. What do you mean? He only had to take it regularly. It was a bike accident, didn't you know? What? - He fell and bled to death. It wasn't the Marcumar. Well, without the Marcumar he wouldn't have bled to death. It was just a ditch. Subtitling by SUBS Hamburg, K. B?ssemeier, C. Stichel
