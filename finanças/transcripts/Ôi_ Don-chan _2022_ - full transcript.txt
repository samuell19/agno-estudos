A SHUICHI OKITA FILM HEY! OUR DEAR DON-CHAN Oh, a lion. There she is. That one's asleep. She's looking this way! - Over there. - That one's asleep. The Gorilla and Tiger Zone! There they are! You can see gorillas! Sorry, were you waiting long? - Yes. - Sorry. How was it? Hmm... These Ueno lions don't have any killer instinct. Shall we try Asahiyama? Nah. I don't think I'm going to sense a real killer instinct in any zoo. That's because they feed them. I guess so. - This is for a commercial, you said? - No, a two-hour TV drama. You have a lot of scenes? No. I get killed right at the start. Michio... are you dumb or something? But I get killed by someone. I've never experienced that. But you're not getting eaten by a lion. It's a person, right? Same thing. - No, it's not. - It's not the same. Okay, show me how you'd look if you were killed. Just do whatever. They won't show your face as much as you think. Just die. Just do it how you feel. Hey, listen. The thing about me is, however small the part, I want to give it my all. Or else I'll never get anywhere. Who would cast me again? I'm telling you, you never know who might be watching. Paul Thomas Anderson could be watching. You just don't know. Who's that? - You haven't heard of him? - No. Your desperation is coming across. I am desperate. Everyone can see, "Oh, that guy's desperate." "Look at that guy." You've been in movies, right, Sakamoto? One or two, yeah. How did you pull that off? Oh, jeez... - Here he goes again. - What is it about you? Really, I couldn't tell you that myself. - I'm not sure. - Give me a break. What's your problem? This guy... I'm through with indie movies too. What's wrong with indie movies? Even if I do an indie movie, they cast me as the main character's friend. I'm so done with that. - I want to go. - Shall we go? - It's hot. - I want to go home. Sakamoto, you can buy us some ice cream with that movie money you have. Good idea. No. - No? - Why not? Come on, treat us. You're making good money. Damn, that itches. - Just some ice cream. - No. - Okay. - Okay? Not! HASE, ENOMOTO, GUNJI I'm back. Hey, guys. What are you watching? The Master. I wanted to watch this! Really? Thanks, man. Wow. It's so hot. How's my boy Joaquin? Is he doing well? Philip Seymour Hoffman... Damn. Has this just started? - About an hour ago. - Really? When's it due back? Huh? You know River Phoenix? He and Joaquin Phoenix are brothers, apparently, right? Which... I don't remember which one is... Stand by... Oh, which one... Is it River? I'm not sure. Is River the older one? Panda. Panda. I want to be in a movie. I want to be in a movie. I want to be in a movie. Let's be in a movie. Come on. I want to be in a movie. Right, guys? - Let's be... - Would you shut the hell up? - What's your problem? - I'm sad. Can I rewind? Hey, let's start from the beginning. Let's restart it. Come on, from the start. - No way! - Why not? Here, here. - Want some? - Thanks. Very nice. Here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seriously? I have to pay 20,000. Come on. - I got five. - Five. One, two, three, four, five. I miss a turn. One, two, three, four, five. - Oh! - Hmm? I've had a baby daughter. - Congratulations. - Children are a blessing. Yeah. - Where's my gift? - How much? 2,000 dollars. You want our cash, huh? There you are, 2,000. Thanks very much. - Gunji, Gunji. - Oh. Apparently tomatoes are good for your skin. - So you should eat them every day. - Really? Cameras are going to keep getting sharper and sharper, picking up any imperfections. - Really? - I'll eat some, then. Here we go. What's the matter? Pass me a tissue. - No way, these are the good ones. - It's fine. No! - Come on, man! - Not happening. - Get some toilet paper. - Tightwad alert! I paid good money for these. I don't need it anyway. I don't need it. - Don't you like tomatoes? - Damn... Whoa. Don't you have rehearsal today? - Hmm? - Rehearsal. Not anymore. Tomita said he can't write the script. There it is. Isn't the show in August? That's right. Oh, I've had another kid. Wow. Genghis Khan over here. Who's that? - 2,000 dollars. - Again? - 2,000. - Thanks. Thank you. Nice. Whose turn is it? Is it me? Oh sorry. Damn, I am paying 3,000? Wait I am being paid? Why is that baby crying so much? - Crying? - Hmm? One, two, three. I spend a load on a rollercoaster. - Does that happen? - I doubt it. So many theme parks. Just don't ride it. I've been thinking about changing my name to change my luck. Spell it all in hiragana, no Chinese characters. Michio Hase. Like Michio Mado does. - Who's that? - There's a guy called that. Called Mado? Never knew that. - I have an idea too. - What? I want to grow bitter melon up here. Nice. That'll keep us cool. Do it. Hey, Enoken. - It's your turn. - Enoken. Enoken. It's outside our front door. Huh? - It's by our door. - What? What the hell? I'm scared! Huh? - What? - When did it arrive? - I don't know. - Me neither. The whole time, maybe? DEAR KEN, PLEASE TAKE CARE OF HER. â€“KAORI YOSHINOGAWA Hey, wait. "Dear Ken." From a Yoshinogawa. You know her? Isn't that Enoken's ex? - For real? - Yeah, that fat one. Enoken. Enoken! So? What's going on? Just get it inside, Gunji. Which way? - This way, this way. - Okay. Okay. I can't see anything! Put the light on! - Let's put it down. - Yeah. Enoken, phone Kaori Yoshinogawa right now. I deleted her number when we broke up. What are you, a little girl? I had to stop myself from calling her. What do we do? Let's just get her out. - Sure. - We'll take her out. Sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. - It's okay. - You're safe. Don't worry. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Have you got her? Let's find something soft. Find something soft. Oh, sorry. Find something soft for her. Here you are. Sorry. Sorry. - Is here okay? - Okay. - Here you are. - It's alright. It's okay! There, there. Entertain her, Gunji. - Ah, Panda! - Panda! Panda, Panda, Panda! Panda, Panda! Look at the pandas! - Panda, Panda, Panda! - Gunji! Play peekaboo with her! Where's Panda? Peekaboo! Where's Panda? Peekaboo! Gunji, you're talented! - You're good. - Really? You're really good. You've got a knack for this. - She's crying. - It's alright! - There, there. - Where's Panda? Peekaboo! Panda, Panda! Look at Panda go! Om nom nom. Om nom nom. Look at Panda! Um, I have an audition for a commercial tomorrow. Why are you telling us that now? - I've made it to the last round. - You're not going. It could be a break for me. - Gunji, you need to comfort her! - Hey, it's Panda! Panda, Panda! There are only two of us left. Gunji, I can smell something. Can't you? - She's done something. - Hold on, now! - What do we do? - We have to change her diaper. - It stinks. - We have to change it. - Do something, Gunji! - We don't have any diapers. She's crying, Gunji! I've heard of Moony and Merries diapers. Huh? Yeah, that should do. Yeah. Huh? Some big ones. L-size. Diapers or pull-ups? Ask a clerk. Huh? Sorry. Okay. Thanks. Enoken? I think the shock has sent him to sleep. That's what human beings do when they're in big trouble. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. They're on! Ouch! That's hot. Hey, hold this. Ah, Gunji. Gentle. Gentle, gentle. Sorry, sorry. Be gentle with her, Gunji. Lift her up. No, no. Sorry. Can you try, Enoken? Enoken? Will you do it? You have a go, Enoken. Here you are. Huh? She's drinking. - She took right to it. - Wow! That's amazing! She's so strong! That's your real daddy! Apparently you have to burp them once they've finished. Huh? Pat a little firmer. Tap, tap, tap. Tap, tap, tap, tap. Ah, she's drooling. - Can I use a tissue now? - Yeah, just use it. Go on. Oh! - Huh? - She burped. Did she just do it? - Whoa. - Awesome! That was so loud! That really was. Everything scares me! - Can I lay her down? - Sure. Here. There you are. Fan her, it's hot. What a nice smile! Is she asleep? Huh? She's asleep. Enoken. Yeah? I think you should check up on all this. Huh? Go to the police or city hall or something. City hall, maybe? She could just be saying the baby's yours. What if she's lying? I see. Get a DNA test. How do they do that? Hmm... I think they pinch your skin with some tweezers or something. That all? I thought they took a hair sample. Well, which is it? Let's all go together soon. Thanks, guys. Tickle, tickle! Tickle, tickle! She's just too cute! Hey, can I hold her? - Sure. - Go ahead. Just don't drop her. - Of course she won't. - No. Oh, you're so sweet! What a sweet thing you are! Her skin's so soft! - Her legs are so chubby! - Chubby-wubby! Oh, is that right? - Is that right? - You're creeping me out. I can't help it. Right? - Right? - Such a cutie! What a cute little baby! Hey... I have to go get a script from my agent today. I'm not sure I can look after her by myself. I've got you. I love kids. Really? You're a lifesaver. You both look tired. Do we? Last night was pretty rough. She cried so much. I feel like I've hardly slept. What's she called? Oh, Seira. Seira, written in hiragana. That's one of those newfangled names. I don't think so. It really is. It doesn't really suit her. Huh? What would, then? How about Don-chan? - Huh? - Why that? Because she's big. Like, "don-don!" You're right. Huh? Oh, Don-chan. I like it. Downtown style. Don-chan! - Don-chan. - Don-chan. - Don-chan. - Don-chan. Don-chan. - Don-chan. - Don-chan. She smiled! - Don-chan! - Don-chan. Are you Don-chan? Is your name Don-chan? - Don-chan. - Are you Don-chan? I knew she'd like going outside. Seriously, though, what will you do? - About what? - In reality, you know. Are you going to adopt her? I don't know. Does nobody have the number for Enoken's ex-girlfriend? He said he doesn't have it. They met at work. At work? Maybe she's an actress. - I bet she is. - Yeah. There you have it. - Some resentment there? - Can I look in that store? I normally would've walked straight past that. It's like a video store is to us. We need to get her some clothes. Who's bathing her? Damn, we need to do that, too. It's scary, putting a baby in the bath, right? I'm going to be late, so I'll see you later. - Okay. - See you. - Thanks. - Sure. Please come in. - Excuse me. - Hello. Hello. - Come on in. - Okay. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'd like to get straight into it. If you'd look into this camera and briefly introduce yourself. My name is Ken Enomoto, I'm 32, and I'm represented by Lamp Next. My special skill is dancing like a clown while wearing a Commedia dell'arte mask. Okay, thank you. Right, would you mind giving us a view of each side? Sure. Go ahead. - Thanks. Once again, please. - Okay. Uh... Right, okay. Go ahead. Thank you. Right, then. I believe you've already looked at the storyboard, so you more or less know what we're doing today. So I'd like you to show us your dance based on your interpretation of the storyboard. - Is that okay? - Yes. - Are you ready to go? - Yes. Okay, then. Take it away. Problem solved in three, two, one! Okay. Can you do it once more? Yes. Go ahead. With more energy, or...? - About the same level of energy. - Right. Just do it a bit differently. Go ahead. Problem solved in three, two, one! - One more time, please. - Okay. Problem solved in three, two, one! Can you do it with more enthusiasm? Sure. About three times more. Yes. Thanks. Take it away. Problem solved in three, two one! You remember you brought a jelly roll that day? That was delicious. - Was it? I didn't buy it. - I wonder where she got it. I think it was in Nakameguro. Wow. I know a great sushi place there. I'll invite Satomi and the three of us can go. Sounds good! I won't be a third wheel? Three is better, you know. She's that skinny girl, right? Pretty, isn't she? - She is. - Nice voice, too. Yeah. Boss. - A visitor. - Huh? Visitor for you. - I'll be right through. - Okay. Excuse me. I'm Hase. - Oh, it's you. - Yes. Hello. Hi. You're late. Huh? Three o'clock...? Sorry. I was held up at work. I don't care. Be punctual. - Got it? - Sorry. You know him? - Um... - Oh... - I think we met once before. - Did we? - I'm Hase. - Nice to see you. He's Miyoshi. Nice to meet you again, Miyoshi. Oh, thanks. Hey. Here. Do you always accept a script with one hand? Thank you. You need to think about these little details. - Like being on time. - You're right. There's a lot to think about. Right. Boss. - I'm going now. - Oh, see you. Bye. See you soon. - Yes, with Satomi. - Yes. You handle that for me. - See you. - Bye. - Next week. - Yes. This is a big part. This part. - Good for you. - Yeah. It's a movie. How did this happen? The director saw you and liked you. For real? Seriously? Do you have any nephews or nieces or anything, though, Hase? Yes, I have one in Hyogo. So you're good with kids? Well, Hyogo's pretty far from here, so... You know. I see. - I suggest you get some practice. - Yes, right. You sure you can play a father, Hase? Listen, it's me we're talking about. Of course I can. I'll be fine. Does he look like a dad? I guess he looks a little young. A little young. I'm not sure. Should I gain some weight or something? No, not that. No, sorry. - How about this one? - Let's see. This is good too. Look at this. The pink matches her baby complexion. I like that. - Yeah! - Yeah! Very fetching. Hey. Oh, that's adorable. Very cute. Look at her. That's the cutest one. - It doesn't suit her. - No, it's super cute. Isn't it? - So sweet! - You're such a weirdo. Why? It's really cute. What's that? Hello. Something's come up, so I need to go out. - Where? - Tomita called me. Tomita? Tomita? - Is he the head of your troupe? - Yeah. He lives nearby so I won't be long. What about her bath? Her bath, man! Sorry. Could you take care of that? Oh, really? There we are. I'm scared to bathe her! What's the matter with you, sweetie? Aren't you a little cutie? Okay, thanks. Hey, Gunji! - Let's do it. - Gunji! Gunji! NISHIMATSUYA CHILDREN'S STORE That's how it is, so... Right. In we go! In we go! Doesn't that feel nice? Lovely water! Oh, lovely! Lovely! Lovely! This is okay, right? This how you do it? - Is this right? - I don't know. Hey... You know, this is what all moms do every day. I know. I admire them. - It's amazing. - Yeah. I'm home. Hey. Hey. Something happen? Tomita is being admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Apparently there's a good one in Nagano. Cheer him up, Don-chan. I feel like I just want to be somebody's housewife. I'm back. Hey. Hi. How was your audition? You are cute! Come on. Say, "Hang in there, Daddy!" Daddy was dancing like an idiot for absolutely no reason today. I'm home. Hi. Guess what, guys? I got a part in a movie! Don-chan! Don-chan! You know how we were talking about going to the police yesterday? Could that wait a little while? - Er... - Fine by me. A little longer can't hurt. I can fit my hand in it now! Kasumi! Daddy! Are you silly or something, coming back here? I'm sorry. Your mother must be worried. Hurry on home, now. I prefer Daddy's fried eggs to sushi. I want you, Daddy! We'll eat together when I come home. We can eat now. Why thank you, young lady. Let's go. Okay. And cut. Cut! Okay. We're done with this scene. On to scene 46. Nice job! - Thank you. - Here you are. Well done. You're not hurt? - Well done. - Okay. See you later. You were great. Good work. - Hey, man. - Hey. Very nice, Hase. You look like a real dad. Oh, thank you. You're going to be a hit. - Hase. - Yes? You'll be a hit! Well, I don't know about that yet... You've got this, right? Keep it up. Are you leaving? Yeah. Why? But I'll be by myself... Boss! Sushi time! Right. Shall we? Let's do it. Want an Ã©clair first? I'm fine. Do you want it after the sushi? Having an Ã©clair first won't ruin it, though. Probably. It's a damn good sushi place. HASE, ENOMOTO, GUNJI, DON-CHAN SCHEDULE FOR DECEMBER 1-7 ENOMOTO, GUNJI, MICHIO DECEMBER 4: EVERYONE AT THE AQUARIUM! Cheers! Alright! Tonight's on me, fellas! Thanks, sir! "Oh, no... I shouldn't have had those donuts." This looks delicious! "I had way too much ramen yesterday..." Come on, don't be shy! Eat! "But not too much!" What you need is Cleargut! Problem solved in three, two, one! Cleargut Digestive. Also available in liquid form. Problem solved in three, two, one... Don-chan. Don-chan, Don-chan. Good morning, Don-chan. Can I have the remote, Don-chan? There. Gunji, where are you? The toilet. What the...? Good morning, Don-chan. How are you today? Shall we change your diaper? Okay. - Morning. - Oh, morning. Could you get a diaper? - Sure. - Don-chan! - Poop? - Uh... Just pee, I think. Is her butt still red? Yeah, it still looks kind of sore. We'll put some cream on it after. Don-chan, Don-chan. Hello there! Hello there! I'm a caterpillar. Caterpillar. I'm a caterpillar. Hello. I'm a remote control. - Remote control. - Gunji! Very good. - Oh, thanks, guys. - No problem. We've got it. I'll make breakfast. Thanks, man. Hello there. Hello. By the way, they're showing the Daisuke Kato Anthology in Asagaya, starting today. Oh? There's going to be a screening of Snow in the South Seas. Who is Daisuke Kato? You don't know Daisuke Kato? - He was in The Seven Sa... - Stand her up properly. Sorry. - Hello there! - Not like that. Just stand her on her feet. CHICKEN AND TOMATO STEW Oh, Michio. You get Don-chan's food ready. The November one? Yeah, yeah. Thank you for this meal. Don-chan, "Thank you for this meal." - Thank you for this meal. - Thank you for this meal. Please. - She did it! - Okay. Here you are, Don-chan. Chew it. That's it. Okay. So, I've got diapers, clothes, food, water, and treats. What else do we need? Diaper sacks. Oh, yeah, diaper sacks. - Don-chan. - And banana. Right, banana. Oops. I wonder if she'll cry. I'm scared of taking her on the train. Some water? She's getting more alert lately so I can imagine her being shy. I took her to the Children's Center and she didn't seem very shy. It's one thing taking her to the station, but it's a long journey. We need to be ready. Make sure you do it right, Gunji. What do you mean? It might not be a big deal to you, Gunji, but today will be a lifelong memory for Don-chan. Are you ready for today, Don-chan? Was that a yes or a no? She's ready. You've got a healthy appetite! Apparently a child can be fated to be fat or not by the time they're three. - Seriously? - Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't feed her too much. Don't give her that. - This? - You can have potato. Here you go. - I'm done, so I'll take over. - You sure? Hi, Don-chan. You're eating standing up? Can you take one? Take a couple. Okay. - Don-chan! - Don-chan! Don-chan. This way. Don-chan, Don-chan. Look that way, Don-chan. Look at the camera, Don-chan. Don-chan, Don-chan. Okay. Isn't it amazing? Wow. There are fish over there too. It's like they're in the sea. Look at those fish. There are loads. Did you see it? Has she ever seen... Has she ever seen fish before? Probably not. Has she seen fish before? I think you're right. Yeah. - It's like you see fish every day. - Exactly. Are these pilchards? Or saury? They're Japanese pilchards. He's gone in the water. He's gone now. He's gone. There's a person in there. Cleaning. - They're cleaning. - Look, Don-chan, a person. A human. He's a person. You'll grow up like that. Oh, Don-chan! You're so close to the camera! Don-chan! They will be eating while training. Well, that was the end of my story. Thank you for listening. Does everyone have their camera ready? Look at that, everybody! Keep clapping to give him the strength to continue! Nice catch! Next up! Coo will... Coo is excellent at balancing so he will balance a giant ball on his nose! Thank you! When you're ready! - Don-chan! - There it goes! Thank you! Thank you very much. Good job. That was incredible. What the hell have you been buying? - We got these. - Look. Look, Don-chan! An eel! Don-chan! She's completely out of it. Is she really tired? This is a Yamanote Line train bound for Shinjuku and Shibuya. The next station is Mejiro. The doors on the right side will open. Here's your last bit of carrot, Don-chan. I might head out with you today, Enoken. Oh, yeah? Oh, Micchan. Sorry, I have rehearsal today. I have to go soon. Soon? Yeah. I... You heard that this morning? Yeah, when I woke up this morning, I had an email. I hadn't realized that today was rehearsals. But I've been talking about the Daisuke Kato Anthology for ages. First I've heard. It's not on the schedule. What? Huh? What can I do? I didn't know I had rehearsals. I talked to you about it. Hold it like this. For real? You can get it on DVD, can't you? No, no, no. The Daisuke Kato Anthology is only available on video. So, you know... You can't get stuff like Snow in the South Seas on DVD. It's only on video. That's why I want to see it in a theater. Whatever. I have to go to rehearsals. - Seriously? - Sorry, man. Can I take this? Sure. I'm sorry, but can you look after Don-chan today? You don't think about Don-chan at all, do you, Gunji? How so? Like the other day, when you... Cut it out, you two. She ate a rubber band because you weren't watching her. Who cares? She pooped it out. - That's not the point. - Stop it! Not in front of Don-chan. I'm going in a minute. Wait up, wait up. I told you I wanted to go to the theater. It's rehearsals, man. Sorry, but I'm leaving with Enoken. Hold up... - Sorry. - Really? - I'm going. - Are you? Sorry. Sorry, Don-chan. - I'm sorry. - Ugh... I'm going. What about you, Enoken? I've got work. What about me? I'm going. - It's work. - Wait. What do I do? What about me? Gunji! Gunji. Huh? Blowing raspberries? Thanks for looking after her. Shut up and go. There's food in the fridge. Rubber bands? Don-chan! Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! - Just shut up and go. What the...? - Can you lock the door? - Yeah. - Oh, Gunji. - Hmm? Something's been bugging you. Has it? Trouble in the troupe? No one's got any enthusiasm. Really? We might break up. I'm not sure. I hope Tomita's doing well. Not likely. Being in a movie or a commercial sure would be nice... I know. You've got it good, Enoken. What are you talking about? I'm working my day job today. Oh, by the way, who's Daisuke Kato? Was he one of The Seven Sa...? Kurosawa. - Huh? - Kurosawa. - You don't know, do you? - Could you tell? This guy... Acting all indignant... Give me a break! Sorry, sorry. My bad. Maybe I'm not so much to blame, though. Micchan was just being a baby. Hello. Hello. Where are we, I wonder? Where are we? This must be a land of snow. Don-chan, look. I'm doing a finger puppet show for you. Where are we? A land of snow. The road is... Don-chan! Watch the puppet show. Don-chan. I'm putting on a puppet show for you. Where are we? Where are we? I can see a pair of eyes. Where are we? Argh, it's a spotted garden eel! Don-chan. Nice and soft. Nice and soft. Nice and soft. Nice and soft. Nice and soft, Don-chan. Hello! It's about your Residents Association membership. Oh, hello! Sorry to bother you. No problem. It's just 1,000 yen, please. Hello! - Sure. - Okay. It's the set amount. - Yeah. - Okay. This is Su-chan! She's two months old. - Yeah. - Okay. Whoosh! Don-chan! Don-chan... Don-chan... - Nice, nice! - Nice! Pregnant, huh? I know... What about money? Maybe they'll just get married. She sounded subdued on the phone. I think she's unsure what to do. Really? Sorry I'm late. This is Maeda. Yoshiko Maeda. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. I'm Tadashi, her big brother. Nice to meet you. You left a bit of a gap before you said your line there, but could you leave more of a gap next time? Got it. You see, the thing about Yoshihiko is... he's a tengu. - He... - Allow me. I was born on a cherry farm in Yamagata. Ever since I was a kid, I've been aware of how long my nose is and how much I love to eat acorns. I'm not quite clear why I fell for a tengu. Because you love him. But I'm not getting anything about what it is exactly I see in him. That's for the audience to decide! But... I'm thinking about that really hard myself, but... - What? - Sumo. That's it. You're having a sumo match while you do it. Right from the start. After we've just met? Okay, here we go. Ready? Start! How was that? Well... we had a sumo match. I'm not sure I get it either. I was hoping something might come to me. So you talked and you didn't feel anything? From him? I mean, at the damn writing stage... I... Are we having a break? What's going on? None of you seem to care if we fail! - What? - Well, I care if we fail. You mean our next performance? Yes, obviously. We all care! Then feel it! Feel it? We've got no chance if you don't give us any clear direction. I'm serious! Be more serious than I am! - Sure. - Show me you're more serious. Yaguchi? Sorry. Will you forgive me? For generations, we tengu... Hold on... Sorry. Hold on. - What's the matter? - Are you okay? My nose feels weird. I'm sorry. - Sorry. - Don't worry. Is it uncomfortable? You look like you're really suffering. - Are you okay? - I'm really sorry. - I just need a minute. - Do you need to breathe into a bag? Can I rest for just a moment? - Sure, of course. - I'm so sorry. Maybe we should make the holes bigger. Yeah. His breathing sounded really labored up close. I was getting worried. As a director, I should see what it's like for myself. You haven't tried it on? - Nice! - I want to go to Okinawa! Let's seriously think about it. As a troupe. Excuse me. I'm going to shoot off now, guys. - Sure. - Okay. I'll leave 1,000 yen. You only had one drink. Sorry, guys. Excuse me. Good session today. - See you! - Bye! Good night! Can he work after drinking? - I don't know. - He's a strong guy. Hey, guys. An acquaintance of mine got in touch. He wondered if we'd be interested in performing in a prison. - What? - In a prison? Performing in a prison? He's looking for a troupe who's willing to do it. Huh. I didn't know they had plays in prison. I guess you hear about that in prisons overseas. Sounds kind of scary though, right? I think it sounds interesting. Come on. It's scary, right? It seems they'll pay us a pretty good rate, though. Have you spoken to Tomita about this? - No. - Is that a good idea? I'm sure he'd be cool with it. Oh... I broke up with him. - Huh? - Really? Yes. - Wow. - Huh. I'm going to step down as a writer. Huh? - What's going on? - Why? I mean, marrying a tengu just makes no sense. Huh? No, no. I mean, what even is a tengu? Tell me. It's stupid. Are you joking? But you wrote it! I'm kind of relieved. I mean, it's like a middle-school production. Don't you think? Hey... Whoa. Don't say any more. - And you, Gunji? - Huh? Oh, well, you know... It was hard to act with my nose itching so much. Not that. The script. Can you write it? Huh? No. You have plenty of free time. No, well, the thing is, I have housework and stuff to do. The housework is... - You can do it. - I... I thought you split it between you? I make everyone's food. But you divide the jobs, right? No... Hello. I can't take it anymore... What? What's going on? I... He's crying. It's all you guys' fault. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. What's the problem? - Huh? - Can I tell you all about it? You can tell me, but... What? Are you busy? One second. I'm not busy... but I am. I'm not busy. Can you come now? No can do. I'm making Don-chan's dinner right now. - I can't now. - Then I'll come to you. Huh? - I'll come to you. - No! I'm coming. No, no. You can't. I'm too busy. I'm coming now. - I'm telling you, you can't. - I'm coming. I've already set off. Fine, then! Come! I was so scared. Were you? Telling me she had something important to say and sitting me down like that. Well, Akari isn't so young. I'm doing my best too. Right. You work hard. I know. I did a movie recently. You were in it for less than a minute, though. I left this house for Akari. I moved in with her even though I had no money. Oh, yeah. That brings back memories of us being housemates. Don't start reminiscing. Yeah. This is no time for reminiscing. Hey, Don-chan. Don-chan, Don-chan. Hey. Don-chan, Don-chan. I want to have kids too someday. Do you? Yeah. I mean, they're so cute. That they are. Come on, Don-chan. Here. That Akari? You not answering? Don't want to. Don't give me that. Yep, thank you for this meal. Don-chan. Here. This not what you wanted? Maybe I will call her. Do what you like. Don-chan, Don-chan. Um... Sorry, do you mind if I give Don-chan a bath? Shall I help? That's okay. You two talk. Don't be long. Why did you come here? Because... you wouldn't come home. That's not my home. What am I going to do? Like I said. You either get serious about work... or we break up. I want to have a baby. Huh? What was Kita no Kuni Kara like? No, I'm sorry! I promise I'll be more considerate! It's okay! You don't have to stop! You're just fine the way you are! You can do this at home. I'll be more considerate! You don't have to stop! You're just fine as you are! MOVING THE GREAT BUDDHA 100 METERS THE SAURY AND THE PLATE 100 PEOPLE What are you watching? - Huh? - Huh? Are you watching something? - A movie. - A movie? Nice. She's asleep. What are you watching? It's a bear! There's a bear! This is crazy. It must have cost a fortune. Wow, Don-chan! Amazing. How pretty. It's Santa! There's Santa. Should we be doing this? There's Santa! Santa! Isn't this cool? Isn't this cool? Wow! Look, look. I can hear someone! I can hear someone! Let's get out of here. - Come on. - Oh, no. Damn! Come on. Just carry it! An acorn? Shall we make it a bulldozer? Let's bulldoze. Hello. My name is Takeru Kimura. Embarrassing as it is at my age, I was let go from my job. Right now, my wife works, and while I search for a new job, I spend every day like this, looking after our son. This way! I thought it was perfectly ordinary for a man to raise kids in this day and age. But in this very moment, I am met with a sight my eyes can't quite believe. What's this? It's an acorn. An acorn. Oh, thank you. At first, I thought they were just friends as I watched them. Are you okay? Did you bang your head? It was becoming increasingly apparent that it seemed that the little girl had three dads. Well done! Let's go again. - Let's go again. - Yeah. Who? Down we go! Just who is the father? - Sorry. - Sorry. Sorry. Careful, careful. How old is he? He's two and a half. Oh, they're about the same age, then. Right. Have you started potty training yet? Are you okay? Is she okay? Is everything alright? - You okay? - Alright? What's the matter? Okay, okay. What's this? - Are you okay, Don-chan? - Does it hurt? It's okay, Don-chan. There, there. Are you okay? It doesn't hurt, does it? The world... is full of mysteries. Daddy's hungry. He's hungry. Let's go eat. We'll come back to the park another time. - Okay, let's go. - Come on. We'll come again. Okay! Let's go eat. Don-chan, dinner's ready. Dinner's ready, Don-chan. - Dinner. - Time to eat. - Okay. - Give me. Here you are. Can you take these for me? - Thank you. - Dinnertime. Don-chan, your stool. Stool, please. - Don-chan. - Your stool. Where's your dinner stool? Stool! - There it is. - Well done. Yes, that was well done. Well done, Don-chan. Whoa, whoa. Delicious. - The mackerel's nice. - It was cheap. It's good. Yeah. Camping, huh? Camping? I guess camping is something dads do. - Really? - That's just a stereotype. No, no. Ultimately, men love to camp. This will be a good chance to show Don-chan we can be manly dads. - Really? - Yeah. I never knew you had this outdoorsy side, Enoken. I don't. What? So you don't know about camping? No. What the heck? How are you two with outdoorsmanship? Well? Well, so-so, I guess. Do you ever camp? I prefer watching movies. I don't like getting dirty. Don-chan, these two are indoors only. - Indoors. - Indoors! That's right. You hate the indoors, right? Right? Oh, no! What's wrong with the indoors? Indoors is great. Let's invite someone who knows about camping. - For sure. - No way. - Huh? - Why not? Because Don-chan might become attached to them. Right... Let's just be real men ourselves. Let's be real dads. Let's fish, too. - You can fish, Enoken? - No. Come on, man! So, tomorrow... Not yet, Don-chan. ...it's the outdoor gear store. - See you. - Have fun. Right. What will you do? Come on, Don-chan. Shimachu, tomorrow. Right? Thank you for shopping with us today. Shimachu is having a sale on the third floor. Oh, sorry. Huh? - Uh... - Yes? The digestive... You know, the gut medicine? Uh... Thank you. "What you need is Cleargut!" No, you've got it wrong... Look. Look at me. No, no, you're misunderstanding me. I'm sorry. So, you were in the commercial. Yes. I'm so sorry. Are you full? She's eaten loads! I think she must have been hungry. Is it yummy? Are you going to eat that? Is it yummy? Don-chan, can you wink? Oh, it's you. Good morning. Fine, come in. Alright. Coming in... Oh. So... Oh, I'm interrupting... - No, no. - Is it okay? Come in. Excuse me. Please. - You're early. - Sorry. Shall I fix some drinks? Yeah. Do we have coffee? We're out. Those teabags will do, then. They're quite old. They'll be fine. You want some bean jelly? No. Okay. - Here. - Thank you. - Both hands, see? - Huh? I can't give you the script yet. - Right. - I'll make a copy. Thank you. Take it out when it gets dark. Thank you. Your tea. - Thanks. - Here. Think of it as trying your luck. Right. You're used to failing. And if you do good, it's India, right? Right. It's a small role, but it's a chance to go global. So, I'd be making sushi? Foreign directors like that stuff. - Making fun of the Japanese. - Yeah. - Hey, Hase. - Yes? Yes? This is your chance. Right. Show them what you've got. I will. Whatever that is. Yes. This is just between me and you, but... Yes? I think you've had your suspicions. Right. We're closing down. Right. Huh? - Huh? - Hmm? - Huh? - Huh? - Huh? - Hmm? Drop it in. - Drop it in. - Yes, drop it in. Go ahead. Drop it in. There you go. What can I make for you first? You only have squid. What would you like? Hey, I heard the news! - About my agent? - No. You're going camping? - Huh? - Oh, sorry. - Take us with you. - Yeah. - You want to come? - Mm. You're indoors people. Look who's talking! I've bought all the stuff... Sorry, sorry. Your order first, please. What do you recommend, chef? Let's see. Right now, I suggest the squid. Because you don't have anything else! Squid, please. One squid! One squid. Who is he meant to be? He's not getting this part. Michio. You look like a part-timer at a conveyor belt sushi bar. There's no gravitas in your face. That's it! You're right. No gravitas. I'm concentrating right now. It's been scored 230 times. Scored 230 times? - There are lies, and then there's that. - What's scoring? - More. - More? - More. More. More. - Here you are. Can Don-chan eat squid? I think crustaceans are a no-go. - Oh... - She can't eat it. Did she touch it? No, she didn't. - I'll put this in the fridge. - Mm. Thanks. Shall I put it in the fridge? - Yeah, thanks. - She's fine. Oh, yeah. We decided to get married. - Huh? - Huh? What would you like, sir? Shut up. - Whoa! - Hey! - Whoa! - Wow! Mr. Pillbug, Mr. Pillbug Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me Mr. Pillbug, Mr. Pillbug Watch him roll over and wriggle Okay, open it up. I'm sure it goes further than this. Look, look, look. What do we do now? - Like this... - Yeah. Keep extending it. What the...? Extend it? How? - Look out. - Ouch! - Ow. - Be careful. It's too dangerous. Shall we give up? No, no giving up! You okay? How do you even put this thing up? At least put your stuff down, man. That's it, that's it. This is the corner. Corner, corner. Corner, right? - Yeah. - Oh, wow! Look, it's done. It's a roof, Don-chan! - Look, Don-chan, we did it! - We made it! - It's done. - A roof! We made it. We made it! Ow! Huh? You okay? Look. Hey, it's not my fault! I'm bleeding. No way. That must sting. - That must sting. - Mm. It really hurt. You going to die? It hurts and I'm going to die. Don't die. Don't die on me. I'll kill you. I'll protect you. Wow, you're so brave. Just slice already. I'll protect you. Splish-splash. Splish-splash. Here. Want to splash it? Watch, Don-chan. E-no! Awesome, no? Don-chan? Daddy just threw a rock. Hmm? Did you see it? Watch. E-no! Awesome, right? E-no! E-no! Should we just use a lighter? Yeah. For the time being. Then what? Are these the firelighters? They're not, right? - Huh? - Did we get some? Does anyone have the firelighters? Why would we come camping just to use firelighters? Well, you know... We don't have any. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Did you just get here? Uh, yeah, a little while ago. Can we start a fire like this? Yeah. Did we not get any firelighters? Do you have any? You don't need firelighters. You don't? - You can't put the kindling like that. - Huh? See this here? These are pine leaves. They contain oil, so they burn easily. They act like firelighters. Oh, really? Impressive. There was only a little. Oh, thanks. That will work a treat. Hey, buddy. The finer it is the better it will burn, So if you have disposable chopsticks or anything similar... - We have disposable chopsticks. - Great. Don't let the kid get close now. Okay. Hey! - That was fast! - It's catching! It's a way. What are you doing? This is awesome. Yeah. It's burning away nicely. Should we put more wood on while it's burning? From below... Keep putting stuff on, and when the fire settles... Ah, thanks. - It's a natural fire, so it's beautiful. - Yeah. Better than gas. Can we put this straight on? - Yeah, it's fine. - Okay. Really? Shouldn't you be wearing gloves or something? Nice to meet you. - Thank you. - Thanks so much. - Have fun. - Say thank you, Don-chan. Thank you. Children are a blessing. Thanks. - Thank you very much. - Nice to meet you. - Take care. - You were a great help. - He really helped us. - What a great guy. Yeah. Hey, shall we put it on? Should I be wearing gloves, or...? - Oh, yeah. - That's for the best. Hey, Micchan. That's my one. This one's ready. It's done That's not true. Hey, you cook it. The camping man's back. Oh, hello. Thank you very much. Would you guys like some matsutake mushrooms? - Nice! - Huh? They smell amazing. I had some leftovers. - Leftovers? - Whoa! - Let me try. - Smell them. They smell so good. Whoa! What an aroma! They smell great. You smell it. I don't know. What? But it's brilliant! - It's great. - Let's cook them. I can't smell it. Come on, come on. - I can't smell it. - What? Take a deep breath. - Which one? - Let me do it again. I've never smelled matsutake before. You've never smelled matsutake? It's amazing, right? Maybe it's the plastic. - Oh, there's the matsutake! - Whoa! Delicious. There's the matsutake! They remind me of my grandma. - Your grandma? - What a lovely smell! - Yeah! - Your grandma is a matsutake farmer? - I'd love to steam them. - Let's eat. Come on, let's eat. Let's fry them. Steaming is better. Hey! - What the hell are you doing? - What are you doing? Hold it! - Stop! - What are you doing? - Hey! Stop! - Hold it there! Hey! Stop! Hey! - Stop running! - Hey! What are you...? You can't get away! Hey, mister! - What are you doing? - Give it up! What are you doing? Hey... Whoa. What's going on? Hey, mister! - Hey! Our dear Don-chan! - Hey!

What is this? Look out! You're surrounded. Is this a kidnapping? Are you kidnapping her? What are you...? I... Children... are a blessing. Children are... He's crying. Yep, he's crying. From Hokkaido. Try our fish. They're delicious. SUSHI Thank you. Alright. I'm a hit. I'm successful. Good luck. Do your sushi chef face. How is it? Do I have the right gravitas? - Yeah, yeah. - You've got it. Um, guys, if this leads to me becoming popular in India, I'm considering moving over there. Would you guys be alright by yourselves? We'll be just fine. Just go already. Oh, Don-chan. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Very good. - Hang on. Can I have a kiss for luck? Give it a rest, man. - Hello, Don-chan. - Kiss-kiss. - There you go! - Oh! There's your luck. - Bye-bye. - See you later. - Bye-bye. - See you. - Bye-bye, Don-chan. - Bye. Say bye-bye. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Oh, Micchan, Micchan. Your sushi face! - Nice, nice. - You've got it! - You've got the look. - Very good. Could you briefly introduce yourselves, please? - Mr. Makita. - Yes. Keep going. Keep going. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay, now Mr. Hase, please. Yes. Mr. Hase? Keep going. Mr. Hase? Tom Cruise. Al Pacino. Joaquin Phoenix. Michio Hase. Michio Hase? Michio Hase... Don't forget. Where have you been all this time, Michio Hase? What have you been doing? I've been honing my skills out of the spotlight. You've been honing your skills out of the spotlight? Mr. Khan says he's finally found a diamond. Right... He says he's found Japan's diamond in you. Huh? Ah... Diamond? Mr. Hase, there's no doubt you will be a star in India. He says you're Japan's Rajinikanth. Raji... Ra... Well, I'll be. Nice to meet you. Oh! Hey! - Hi. - Long time no see. Long time no see. How've you been? Well. It's been too long. - Here. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, Tomita. - Hmm? - Shouldn't you be back at the hospital? - We're going. Thank you. Delicious. Nice, isn't it? They use good dough. - Oh, Tomita. - Hmm? Are you sure you don't need to get back? We're going now. Yummy. Yeah. - Let me have some of that. - Sure. - Good, right? - Yeah. Is the soba good? Yeah, it's tasty. Oh, um... You know the Tokyo Olympics? What, from way back? No, they're hosting it again in five years. Oh, really? Well, they're going to build a stadium in Kamakura. They have to move the Great Buddha 100 meters out of the way So the government is assembling all the NEETs from across the country. They're moving it by hand, so they'll be dripping with blood. - Huh? By hand? - By hand. You mean... they're not using any machinery? It won't be as striking if they use machinery, you see. Striking? This business about moving the Great Buddha... Yes? Is this a play you're doing? Yes, that's right. And the Great Buddha? Huh? How will you make it? Oh, out of polystyrene. Um... I wanted to take the helm and do a good job. I won't let the troupe fall apart. I'm just waiting for you to come back. I think you should make the story closer to home. Huh? Forget about the Great Buddha for now. Make it about something you're all familiar with in your lives. Don't you agree? There must be something. Thank you for waiting. Thank you for traveling with us today. This train is bound for Ueda. The next station is Yagisawa, Yagisawa. The front door on the left side will open. This train is operating without conductors. Please use the front door to get off. THE OLYMPICS AND THE GREAT BUDDHA HEY! OUR DEAR DON-CHAN You're hurting me! Here we are. More and more children are on waiting lists. Parents who want to work, but can't. Just what future awaits our country? What the hell is happening to this country? Tell me about it. I can't contain my anger. Right. They can build as many kindergartens as they like, but there's no staff. Exactly. A kindergarten won't take your kid unless you work full-time, and you can't work unless they're in kindergarten. It's truly a vicious circle. Absolutely. Politicians need to take this problem more seriously. - You got it! - Sort it out! Preach it! It's no good. Yeah. No good. It's hot. Is the air conditioner working? That thing's ancient. Let's just open the window. Shall we? What gives? There's a weird person. Weird person? Huh? A woman. Is she still there? I don't know. - Huh? - Huh? - There's nobody here. - Huh? She was really creepy. Could she have been a ghost? Huh? A summer ghost. Ghosts are affected by the season? The summer ghost is a special one. Only kids can see it. You've got a special summer in store, Micchan. A special kind of ghost, huh? Hello. Hey, guys. - It's a ghost. - A ghost. Hello, Don-chan. Look, there's Gunji and Micchan. - You get the watermelon? - Yeah. We're home. We're home. We got watermelon. - Oh, thank you! - Thanks. Watermelon. Watermelon? Take your shoes off. Ghosts! - What? - We're not ghosts. - Huh? - We're not ghosts. - Okay. - Not ghosts. No, we're not. What are they talking about? What are you talking about? I'm sorry. Sorry. What are you talking about? Let's wash our hands. - Go wash your hands. - Come on. Okay, like this. Rub them together. Both of your hands. Rub, rub. Are they clean? Yeah? Okay. Give it to me! Give me the ball. Give it. Hey, give me the ball! - Ball... - That's not a ball. - Yeah. - It's a bump. Ouch, ouch! That hurts! Ow! - Oh! - Ah! - She got rid of it. - Thank you! - Thank you for this meal. - Thank you for this meal. - Don-chan, say it. - Don't forget. She doesn't do it recently. Who cares? You'll get fat if you don't get any exercise. Very good. That was a cute face. Here. There you go. - Do you like it? - Yummy? The cucumber will dry out. Hey... I've prepared the watermelon. Oh, thanks. - Thanks. - Looks really good. Awesome. Beautiful. - Here you are. - Thanks. - You want some, Micchan? - That okay? - One piece okay? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Thank you. Don-chan. Delicious. Delicious. Want some watermelon, Don-chan? Are you playing? Yummy, right, Don-chan? You like it? Stop that. Sorry, sorry. You don't like it, do you? When do you go again, Michio? 21st. Not long, then. No. I'm not ready at all. Apparently you should pack medicine. You get the runs there. Oh, really? And you need to watch out for dogs, too. Rabies will kill you. You're scaring me now. Finally time for India, huh? Yeah. I'll be a reverse import. Huh? I won't come back until I'm a star. We might never see you again, then. Then you'll just be an export. Well, you say "export" but... I have a feeling that being overseas might suit me better. I've always thought I didn't fit in with Japan's narrow scope. - Oh, really? - Mm. You thought that? Let's have Micchan bring back some curry. She's dripping juice everywhere. Answer when I say your name. Okay. - Toshiyuki Nishida. - Yes. That's not your name! - What's that? - I taught her it. - I want a go. - It works with any name. Put your hand up when I say your name. Okay. - Tetsuko Kouroyanagi. - Yes. That's not your name! Cool. - Akira Kurosawa. - Yes. That's not your name! Hideki Matsui. - Yes. - That's not your name! - Kyusaku Shimada. - Yes. That's not your name! That's not your name! TWO MONTHS LATER Don-chan. Yes. Kya haal hai? How are you? Kya haal hai? Do you know who I am? Don-chan. - Oh, you scared me. - Oh. When did you get back? Did I startle you? Hey, Enoken! Micchan's home! Huh? What are you doing here? Surprise. Hey, Michio's surprised us. Oh, is Sakamoto here? Hello. Oh... The summer ghost. Huh? Um... - This is Yoshinogawa. - Hello. Huh? Well, I mean, you just showed up out of nowhere, so... You hungry, Micchan? We were about to eat. - Yeah. - We're having curry. Curry? Anyway, come on in. - While you were in India... - Mm. ...she suddenly got in touch and came to the house. Then what? "So? Has she grown? I want to see her." What the hell? - I was mad, you know. - Yeah. She abandons Don-chan, then she gives a crap all of a sudden? It's only natural to be mad. - But... - Hmm? ...the thing is, she's her mom. Huh? What? I thought about Don-chan's needs. Put the putty away. Then she started coming every day. Huh? What's with that? She comes round every morning, see. And... it's kind of a big help, I guess. Your room was free. So, before I knew it, she was sleeping here. I can't believe you. I told you to clear this away! You okay with this, Gunji? Yeah, I'm okay with it. It's a good thing. Don-chan has her mom back. Huh? She helps out with the housework, too. And our play's opening soon. And then there's Enoken... Right. - Enoken. - Huh? - Tell him. - Who cares? Tell him. - No. - Go on! - No. - Man... Tell me what? - No. - Tell him! What is it? - I don't want to. - Tell him! Me and Haruka Ayase are playing a married couple. Huh? I'm playing Ayase Haruka's husband. Look! He can't help smiling when he talks about it. I'm preparing for the role. You understand. This is taking preparation too far. - Here. - Thanks. Oh, and she's called Kimiko. - Huh? - Don-chan's real name. Kimiko Yoshinogawa, apparently. The curry's ready! - Okay. - Okay. - Let's eat. - Yummy. Is it yummy? - Michio. - Yeah? So there's money to be made out in India? Nice. You think they'll hire you again? Well, if Mr. Khan wants me again. - Mr. Khan, he's called. - Khan, huh? Awesome. Mr. Khan. Isn't that cool? - Isn't that cool? - Mr. Khan. Oh, yeah, you know that video you sent us from India? Where you're dancing. Don-chan loved watching it. Dance, dance. She copies every move. - Huh? - Dance. - She can dance? - Watch this. That's it! I got it a bit wrong. You got it a bit wrong? Ask Micchan how to do it. Like this. Very cute. Very cute indeed. Sit down and eat now. Sit down, please. What's going on? What is this? - Huh? - You don't think this is weird? - What is? - It's weird. This situation. - Cut it out. - It's weird! You're weird! It's weird, you know! Leaving a kid here then disappearing? That's not normal! And after everything we've... Micchan. That stuff's done now. Huh? We went through all this stuff. You did? It's all sorted now. Sorry. It's not your fault, Kaori. Huh? So, what am I supposed to do with my anger? Just keep it to yourself. Huh? Why didn't you tell me about this? We thought it could wait until you came back. You had your hands full with the shoot. Plus, it's expensive to make calls to India. Then do it over the internet. What about you, Don-chan? That's right. What are you saying? What about you? Tell me, Don-chan. Are you happy to have your mom? Where are you going? Huh? It's okay, right? Ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom. Congratulations! Congratulations! A big round of applause for the happy couple! A rousing recital by Mr. Choji Wada. Round of applause, please. Thanks, thank you so much. Yes. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Everyone's getting me drunk. - Of course they are. - Okay, cheers. - Thank you. Congratulations. You know... to be honest... I've been... thinking about... I've been mulling this over. Maybe I need a steady job. I think it might be a good idea. I see. - But... - Mm. ...I got a part in a taiga drama. - Huh? - Taiga. For real? - Just as I was considering quitting. - Really? That's incredible. The big NHK drama? Who are you playing? Date Masamune. What? Date Masamune. You're kidding. As in the samurai? It's a small part, though. A small part, but a famous name. That's not true. So, that happened. Apparently I look like him at a glance. That's why it's only a small role. I feel like I've been blessed, you know. - I'm not sure how to put it. - Yeah. Also, I feel like I'm being told that I shouldn't quit. Oh, by the gods of acting? - I see. - I get that feeling. - There's a sense of that. - Yeah. I guess maybe it's like you said. Huh? What do you mean? Remember? However small the part, you should give it your all. That's really special. - It's special. - Oh, I'm not special. It's very powerful. No, no. I'm thinking of visiting Sendai, where he lived. - You should go. Do it. - Should I get rid of one of my eyes, too? - Do it. - I'm not doing that. No? No. I'll get a picture. - Say "four degrees." - Four degrees. Ready? - Four degrees! - Four degrees! What does that mean? I'm getting married next! Will you bring it for me? Go fetch it. You want me to carry you? - Go get Lion. - Here's your hat. Go get Lion. You want me to get Lion? - Is he upstairs? - No. Where is he? In here? Oh, there. - There. - There, there. Okay. Put him over your head. Okay. Alright, off we go. Off we go. Okay. Give me five. - Nice. - Kiss? Kiss? Why not? Let's try this side. Kiss. Why don't you want to? Okay, see you later. Take care. Okay. Bye. -Bye -Okay. - Can you lock it? - Sure. - See you later. - See you. One, two, three, four, five, six... Micchan. - Huh? - Have some bitter melon. Oh, sure, sure. - It's bitter. - It's good for your skin. You won't look good on camera at this rate. On those 4K cameras? Yeah, you'll look like crap on them. - You need to collect your salary. - Oh, yeah. Sorry. - I was... - Oh, no! I forgot to give Don-chan her lemonade! - She might be crying now. - Seriously? How? - I... - You didn't put it in her backpack? It's because Kaori's looking after her today. That could be a problem. Yeah. Hey, have you noticed how she goes to the bathroom by herself recently? Oh, yeah, yeah. I've been thinking she doesn't need diapers anymore. We can finally stop using them. Stopping the diapers kind of feels like the end of an era. How so? It's like... She's grown up. I get you. This is some refined stuff. It's been a while since we've done this, hasn't it? So, this... is what they mean by "refined," huh? Huh? Can you guys hear a baby crying? You're joking. I guess not. - I can only hear cicadas. - I was panicking there! - Not again! - Nope. - Whose turn is it? - Yours. Mine? Oh. I've had a baby. Typical. That's just your destiny. Genghis Khan over here. - Who's that. - You forgot? Hey, I've had a kid. Your gifts. - 2,000 dollars. - 2,000 dollars? - 2,000 each. - 2,000 each. Here. Buy some diapers with it. Here. Buy some formula with it. How kind of you. Hey, um... - Enoken. - Hmm? We've... been doing some thinking. Where's this going? We're thinking about moving out. It's for the best, right? Well, about that... Yeah? We've been talking about moving out ourselves. No, we'll move out. Don-chan shouldn't be uprooted. And moving is expensive. I made a lot of money working in India. I've also got a payday coming, so... Don-chan's needs should come first. Yeah. Don't worry about us at all. I wish I was successful. I know. Your time will come soon. Me too. It's surprising how strong that desire is, right? - One day... - Yeah. ...I want Don-chan... to be proud that her dad's an actor. That would be nice. Yeah. I feel the same way. Huh? Can you hear a child's voice? I hear it. Listen. - There. - Oh, you're right. They're back. - Hey! - Oh! What's going on? She insisted we had to go home. Hey! Welcome home! It's me she wanted to see. Don-chan! They are all gone. All gone. Who's that? Who? Huh? Hello again! Oh, nice! Hey, there! Yippee! The prison guard just told me... Yeah? Smiling is forbidden. Huh? They're damn strict. I'm back. What are you watching? The Master. Oh, I wanted to watch this. How's my boy Joaquin? Is he doing well? Did you know that Joaquin Phoenix is River Phoenix's big brother? A panda from Ueno Zoo. I want to be in a movie. Put me in a movie! Put me in a movie! Movie, movie, movie! Would you shut the hell up? What's your problem? I'm sad. Shall I rewind it? Hey, let's watch it from the start. Hey. Cut it out, you two. I've been saying for ages that I'm going to see the Daisuke Kato Anthology. First I've heard. It's not on the schedule. Huh? What can I do? They've called a troupe meeting out of nowhere. Meeting? More like getting hammered at the bar. Huh? - Just disband already. - That's enough, you two. You can see the movie another time. No, I can't. They won't show the Daisuke Kato Anthology again for ages. It must be on DVD. - It's only on VHS! - Right. That's true, it is. Yeah. Children are a blessing. - Hey! Our dear Don-chan! - Hey! Our dear Don-chan! I want to be a success! Right. I know. I want to be a success. It's surprising how strong that desire is, right? One day, I want Don-chan to be proud that her dad's an actor. That would be nice! Yeah! I'd like that too! Huh? What's up? She insisted on coming home! Daddy! - Hey! - Hey! Stand! Hey, what are you doing? Help us pack up. Sorry. I'm exhausted. It happens sometimes. It's just the way it is. Yeah. I'm sorry. It was our first performance. And in a place like this. Hey, just come when you're feeling better. Okay. Thanks. Are you the troupe leader? Oh, um... No, I just wanted to thank you for coming today. It was our pleasure. Thank you. I have something for you. From an inmate called Ozawa. - Yes? - He really wants you to see it. Oh... Excuse me. To all members of the troupe. Nice to meet you. My name is Ozawa, and I am currently serving a 15-year sentence for theft and rape. I haven't seen much "theater" in my life, so I don't know much about it. But to get to the point, I thought everything about your play was so wonderful that I just had to write this letter to let you know. I myself had a child before coming to prison, but I didn't feel brave enough to see them even after I'm released. However, after watching your play today, I decided I would go to see them once I get out. Thanks to you, my life will change. Thank you for changing me. Yuji Ozawa. No way! Micchan and Gunji are going. - Well... - Shall we get going? See you later. Look after yourselves. - Yeah. - Don-chan. Don-chan. It's bitter melon. Look after it so it grows. - Say thank you. - Will you say thanks? - Say thank you. - Thank you. Take good care of it. Yes. Answer when I say your name. Okay. - Don-chan. - Yes. That's not your name! - Don-chan. - Yes. That's not your name! Hey! Our dear Don-chan! Yes! - That's not your name! - That's not your name! That's not your name! Shall we hit the road? Look, they got in. No, you can't do that. It's dangerous. It will start shaking. - See you later. - See you. - Bye-bye. - See you soon. You want to high-five? Don-chan, bye-bye. Bye-bye. - Let's kiss. - See you. Bye-bye. Are you giving me a kiss? - No! - She doesn't want to! She doesn't like kisses. - Stay back here. - See you later. Bye-bye. Here. Now's a good time. - Later. - Bye-bye. - No! - No? - Bye-bye! - See you soon. See you later! - See you! - Don-chan! Don-chan! Bye-bye! Careful. - See you. - See you. See you later, Don-chan! Bye-bye! Don-chan, bye-bye! Bye, Don-chan! Don-chan! - Don-chan, bye-bye! - Don-chan! - Don-chan! - Don-chan! - Don-chan, bye-bye! - Don-chan! Don-chan! - Don-chan! - See you again! - Goodbye, Don-chan! - Don-chan! Don-chan! Don-chan... Okay. - Sofa first? - Sure. There we go. This way. I've been bitten by a mosquito. Give me something light. Something light, huh? - Guys. - This is light. Thanks so much for doing this. Right. She's tired. That's very precious. I'll treat you guys to soba or something later. Don't be so grumpy. This is pretty hefty. Buy us some ice cream. I'll get you some after. You can pay us in ice cream. Get something easy for Akari. Yeah. What's this thing for? - It's pointless. - Soba will be fine. Okay. - Is that them? - They're here. - Hey. - Hey. Here they come. That was fast! It was fast! - Okay. - There they are! It really is close, isn't it? Well, that's for the best. In case you ever need help. Yes, it's them again! This is perfect. Need a hand? You sure? Woo!
