WEDNESDAY 04:45 Athens, Winter 2010 I know what you're thinking... You're thinking there's always that moment when you think you're going to make it. You're 20, 25 and you've got all the time in the world to get there. You're in no hurry. You're feeling strong and everything seems possible... And then... everything turns to shit. And the worst thing is... nobody's told you the truth. The time you've been given is not enough... That's what you're thinking now... It never was... Time starts now. MONDAY 22:47 Those who touch me don't die 17 years ago, when I decided to open a live jazz club all my friends asked me the same thing: Stelios, man, are you crazy? 17 years later I finally found the answer: Yes, I'm crazy! And I realized that every night I will be here, we will all be here because we all love, and will always love, good music. - All right! - Yeah, dude! It's my pleasure to introduce for the first time 3 new talents, 3 local boys. Dinos Sigelis on the trombone Elias Eliadis on guitar and Yannis Dalis on drums. The applause and the future belongs to them, you'll see. We really want to thank Mr. Dimitrakopoulos for this opportunity. We hope you have a good time. It's pretty dead. Monday night... Do you hear that? - What? - The subwoofer... What about it? It's creaking... I have to go. I don't get it. What is it you don't get? I don't get why you always have to go. I have to lock up... The club. Have Georgiou check the speakers tomorrow. - Again? - How did we do? Not that great. - How was the band? - Fine. I'm christening my son at noon. Don't forget! Dormition of the Holy Virgin 12-12:30, Argyroupoli. 12:00! - We'll find it. - It's on the invitation. - You're not nervous, are you? - A-okay, Godfather! That's the spirit! - Guys, I hear it went well. - Very well. Mr Dimitrakopoulos thank you so much! We'll talk after the holidays. - Meaning? - We should make it a regular thing. Mr Dimitrakopoulos thank you so much! You try to hide your weakness and the tempest in your heart. You're always teasing me and playing games. Pouting and sulking you hide your pain and hurt me so... Mr. Stelios, there's a guy named Vassos asking for you. You lock up and take the van to the airport. - What was the name again? - Beograd Jazz Quintet. Where did you dig them up? - Where have you booked? - At the HAVANA. 5 rooms. Five? They didn't have two triples so I booked an extra single. OK. Mr. Stelios... about that thing we talked about? Tomorrow. Don't worry I'll take care of it - I promise. - Thank you. Thank you so much! ...don't laugh, don't laugh... That Italian sure is ramming it up your asses. Who? He's turned you into a bunch of amateurs. Talk about benching. He pulls the players sends in the ball stoppers and you lose the game again. You guys wanted a foreign coach - ...right, Mr. Artist? - I guess so. Then it's the bench for you gentlemen! I don't like cops myself but those kids froth at the mouth at the sight of them. The riot police vans are still lying there. - It stinks of burned rubber, ya know? - It's not the rubber. It's that chemical shit they bring in from Israel that's also burning. - It's worse than Beirut, ya know? - And we ain't seen nothing yet... So how's Sophia? The kids, how old are they now? Are they any good at school or are they like my kid? Huh? Are they top of the class or top of the trash, like mine? My boy is in first... second year high school. You don't say, Mr. Artist! He must be a handful! And your daughter? She started kindergarten this year. How about yours? He's in Bucharest. Still hasn't graduated, the bum! What's he doing there? Jacking off... Medicine. That's a good school. My cousin from Hamburg went there too. Did he graduate? My stupid-ass son got mixed up with some slut. I can't see him becoming a doctor. It's probably for the best. We don't want him killing off some poor bastard! At least you know he didn't turn out queer, ya know? That's no small thing... Morning. Spare some change? - Here you go. - Thanks, brother. At every traffic light verfickte junkies, ya know. Brother, you're a kind man! Can you open the compartment and grab the coffin? Say what? Ya know, the box. You mean the case? Thanks. Sun's up, ya know? Where are you going?! Don't ignore me! I'm not a piece of trash! I'm a human being, goddammit! Don't detest me! If you touch me you won't die. Come on, lady! Sun's up, ya know. Those who touch me, don't die! You hear me?! Those who touch me, don't die! Like a cloudy sky a loneliness like a rainy day. A heartlessness and my secret longing like a brother embraces me tenderly. TUESDAY 07:07 Family always comes first ...a loneliness like a rainy day. But it's not rain, it's tears falling. It isn't fire it's the sorrows speaking. And the cloudiness snuffs out the stars. And oblivion undoes each joy... One Coca-Cola... Excuse me, do you have Loux Cola? Great, with a straw. One Greek coffee, no sugar, and... - A double espresso. - One double espresso. I told you already! Room 208! He's talking about Loux Cola. He likes it. It reminds him of a cola they had in Romania. Then the free market came the free Americans with the free multinationals... and they fucked everything up. Open market they called it, but it was a closed monopoly. You can no longer find cola... or traditional refreshments anywhere in Romania. Now, we freely enjoy only the goods of capitalism. He says that when I introduced you in Bucharest 4 years ago... I, Vassos, personally vouched for you. That's why we decided to help you out. But you haven't kept up your end of the deal. I'm a businessman, but above all, a family man. I have to look out for my people. He says, he can't keep coming down to Athens. The market has dried up. Nobody pays cash. Tell him, I understand. People owe me money too. I'm always asking my Greek friends about Stelios... and they all see a guy who lives comfortably has a successful club in Psyrri, a nice car, a big house. You don't look like you have money problems. Please tell him, that's not true. The other day they gave me 40,000 in post-dated cheques. I'm still looking to cash them. He says that 4 years ago he loaned you 47,000. Two years after that you asked for another 27,000 and then another 8... the year before last. He reminds you that in good faith he didn't ask for collateral - your house or the club and when I asked him, on your behalf for low interest, 3.5% per month he made an exception and agreed. - Yes Like he agreed to stop the clock and gave you 2 years interest free. Correct... But over the last 9 months... you've either been late or postponed paying interest 7 times. That leads to additional charges, minus the sum you paid tonight: 148,237 That's the total today. Euros or Lei? That, I won't translate. The matter must be settled. Tomorrow. He asks how you plan to pay. I'll arrange it. I'll make a few calls. Like I said, people owe me too. Ask him please... will he accept the post-dated cheques? He says, in Romania we don't pay our debts with the debt of others. Okay. I'll find a solution. I need a little time... Tell him, people owe me too. Answer it. It's Sophia. Excuse me. He says you should answer. He's a family man too. Family always comes first. Yes... I can't right now... Dammit, Sophia, I said I'll take her. I can't talk now, I'm on the road. I promised I'd take my daughter to school... Sophia's busy. He asks if your daughter takes guitar lessons on Thursdays. What the fuck is that? Tomorrow you'll sign the papers. You'll hand over the club to him. He says it's less carbonated. Do you have Loux or Coke at the club, he says. What the hell are you up to? - What? - Nothing... Move it. - Give us a moment. - See you downstairs. What was that about my daughter? A figure of speech, you know how it is. No I don't, you tell me. Nobody's gonna touch your family. It's me you're talking to. Are you trying to fuck me over? - You're the one that fucked up. - And you set me up. You fucking asshole! Do you know what you're saying? Do you know what you've got yourself into?! - I know you got me into this! - You asked for it! Be careful, I told you. Be straight, I told you. Don't fuck up, I told you. He's not in this 'cause he's a boy scout, I told you. Didn't I tell you? Fix your collar. I told you. - Dad, mum's looking for you. - I know. Panos, what time do you get home? - Around 2, a quarter to. Why? - Come inside! On the school bus? I won't ask where you were. You won't tell me anyway. And I really don't care... Sophia, I told you I was going to be late at the club. But when you make a promise, at least keep it. I'm here, aren't I? The christening is at noon. I'm going to be a godfather. - Congratulations... - Are you coming? ...the city-sponsored Christmas tree will be given a 24-hour police guard again this year... in order to avert another arson attack... So Dione, how are your piano lessons going? Guitar... What was that, sweetie? I take guitar lessons, not piano. Isn't it every Thursday? I have guitar lessons every Monday and Friday! But we've stopped for the holidays. I see... And do you like it? I wanted to play handball but Mum won't let me. One moment... Hello... I said, it's not the tweeter... Must I start pulling out cables? Weren't they the ones who set up the speakers? I saw what a great job he did with the grounding. Tonight with the Serbs, we'll look like idiots. You can't hear it? Are you kidding? It creaks! Someone's got to take responsibility! - Dione, what were you saying? - I don't know, I forgot. I don't care if you'll be late! What are you staring at? Are you a man or aren't you?! Then take responsibility! I'm not going to be around forever. What are you staring at? If something happens to me, what are you going to do? I'll show you. One last time. Pay attention! Don't ever show up again with your shoelaces undone. I'm telling you, don't you dare! What are you staring at? I swear! I won't let you in the house! I'm thinking... I'll mortgage the house. The house is already mortgaged. I'll mortgage it again, with another bank. Stelios, come to your senses! I asked but you didn't answer. - What? - When did you last sleep? Alexandros, there must be a way to cash the cheques to get the Romanian off my back and then... I'll see. You think you'll get rid of him with peanuts? We're talking 148,000. People get stabbed in the street for 20 euros. What do you mean? It's not how much, but who you owe it to. You want me to hand the club over? - I've put 17 years into that place. - Stelios, look around you. People are trying to salvage or grab anything they can and you want to fight mafia loan sharks? - Ever held a gun in your life? - How would you know? Wolves stick with wolves and sheep stick with sheep. And we definitely don't belong with the wolves. I'll draw up the paperwork and we'll meet later tonight. Do you renounce Satan? And all his works? And all his worship? And all his angels? And all his ritual? I do renounce him... Have you renounced Satan? I have renounced him. Have you renounced Satan? I have renounced him. ...to put off your old self which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires and have put on the new self... ...the servant of God is baptized Kyriakos in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. - Always be worthy, godfather! - Thank you very much. - Congratulations, boss! - It's very kind of you. Always be worthy, boss. Are you okay? Excuse me? Oh... I'm sorry... Hello. I didn't have time. I'll get him some stuffed tomatoes. I told you. I was busy with the club. From that restaurant in the square. Look, he's a grown man now he's got to learn to eat it. Fine... I've got to go! How was school? Did you learn anything interesting today? What? You're mad at me and you're sulking? I see... Then, you're responsible! Hello. What do you mean? What's wrong with the room? They don't like it? Okay, have them change it. Ask for a room with a view of Lycabettus Hill. How much? You must be kidding! There's a tree on the kitchen counter. I know what you're going to say, but this isn't a good time. On the contrary. I think my timing is perfect. I'll sweep up the pine needles and decorate the tree myself. Do we have Christmas decorations? Where? In the store room? What? So, did you pull off the christening? Are you a godfather now? Aren't you going to ask me where I've been? Of course not. You don't care. It's got nothing to do with your club. Sophia... I know, it isn't a "good time"... - Sophia, c'mon... - What? Christmas is coming. Why don't we take the kids and go someplace nice... ...in the countryside? They'll love it. I'll come along too... ...in a day or two. Tomorrow morning they're giving out report cards at your son's school. If you can't be straight with me at least do the one thing you do best. Get over there and pretend to be... a father who cares about his kid. It's not hard. You've done it before. - Why didn't you tell me sooner? - I did, but you forget. I'll be there. I mean, we'll go together. I promise! I went to see Alexandros... He'll tell you when the time is "good"... What d'you mean?! I was there this morning. Mum! Where are my sneakers? Where are you off to? To play basketball. Now? No, next week! You can go in the afternoon. I'm making lunch. C'mon mum, just a few hoops. What's gotten into you? Don't you have your German lesson at three? - Three thirty, quarter to four. - You'll never make it on time. Panos, you'd better listen to your mother. I've got plenty of time! Listen to your mother! You're staying home! Getting into character? What? Playing the good father already? - Save it for tomorrow. - I don't follow. Mum! Will you tell me where my hi-tops are, or what? Hello? Where are you, Artist? Who is it? It's Vassos! I've been calling forever... Listen, the Romanian needs a favor. And it would be good for you to do it. What kind of favor? He wants you to pick something up. Hasn't he heard of couriers? A little positive attitude wouldn't hurt... - ...it would help. - With what? No, mum! The new ones. How did this happen? - The kids were fighting. - With my record collection? - I don't know; with each other. - Where were you? - Here! How about you? - Why didn't you stop them? You could 've been here to stop them. This can't be fixed. Nor replaced. It's called "family". Mum! Should I look myself? - I have to go. We'll talk later. - Do I need an appointment? - Mum! - Hold on! How's Dione getting home from school? As always. I'm picking her up. - Are you sure? - I said, hold on! I probably put them away with your summer clothes. I promise, when I come back I'll decorate the tree myself, OK? What summer clothes? They're basketball shoes for crying out loud! TUESDAY 14:31 Probably Greek You, whom I know so little You, whom I love so very much Tell me should I go or should I stay Hey pal, you won't be long, will ya? I'm waiting for the movers. - Five minutes. - It's crazy... they locked down the city center again... Do you know a club called Alcazar? You just passed it. It's two blocks that way. Five minutes, okay pal? DOORBELL He's fucking crazy, man! Totally nuts! - The brunette wasn't bad. - You mean Angeliki? Angeliki my ass! She's black! She was born in Congo to a Greek father. - Bullshit! - Fine, but take a look at Sasha. Pal, this isn't the boonies. The Eastern bloc has run its course. - But she's Czech. - Same difference... - Yes? - Vassos sent me. Leave us. He said... I'm supposed to pick something up. My friend, are you Greek? Well? I said, are you Greek? Like our little boy Petrakis here? Yeah, probably, what do you mean? I ask you if you're Greek and you say "probably". Interesting... I'm from Albania. I came here 18 years ago. Didn't speak a word of Greek. I worked construction; I did it all. Plasterwork, plumbing, wiring... Then I ran a cleaning service for 7 years. I learned the language, settled down, had two kids. I bought this club. I fixed it up. Now I pay taxes... and my eldest son was picked to march in the parade next to the flag-bearer. Next to the Greek flag! What does that make me? What does it make my kids? Albanians or Greeks? But when I asked the bank for a loan, they turned me down. Why? Because when it suits them I'm Greek... or "Northern Epirot" whatever the fuck that means and they put my son next to the flag-bearer. And when it doesn't, I'm an Albanian cunt. I'm a businessman, you fucks! Not a pimp! Petrakis, what did the gentleman say he was? Probably Greek. Well, Mr. Probably Greek? I don't know what the deal is. I was just told... ...to pick something up. You tell that Romanian cunt, if he still has any balls, he can come here himself! Tell him Omer got his numbers mixed up and doesn't remember how much he owes. Okay, Mr. Probably Greek? Sorry... Take your sweet fucking time! It ain't like I have a job to do! Calm down, okay?! I said I was sorry. Not as sorry as you're gonna be, motherfucker! Outta here, while you can still drive your fag piece of shit! - You're nuts, pal. - Fuck off, you cunt! Beat it, you son of a bitch before I smash your fucking fag car! Fucking cocksucker! Outta here, bitch! Run, you fucking pussy! My grandpa used to bring me here when I was a boy... Our Royal Garden! It wasn't such a dump back then. Grandpa! I'm out of seeds! They've had enough. Where did the ducks go, Grandpa? Gone... The Pakistanis ate them... Are the Pakistanis bad? Nah... Just hungry... ...like the pigeons. Here. Go on. Go buy some seeds to feed them. Word on the street is, the Romanian's giving you a hard time. Word is, he's planning something big. Can you help me out? Things are tough all over. You know how it is, Stelios. I... I need to cash two cheques, 40,000 in total. Is that all you got for the Koromilia property? Stelios... D'you know what's wrong with this country? Why, is anything right? It's been borrowing it's way out of debt for two centuries now. Like your father always said: "the useless"... You know how it is... "They" plundered this land. I warned you not to get mixed up with scum. They're hungry. They smell blood and they strike... You didn't listen. We could've worked out the interest. You weren't cut out for this. Like your father always said: you were artsy fartsy. - Bullshit... - What would your father say? I don't know, Since he died, he doesn't say much. He was a man of God. We all respected him in Kastoria. You know how it is... - Good men die young in this country. - And the bad ones always survive. Nah... The useless survive Stelios. You know how it is... The useless... and the hungry... Slow hours, lonely hours bitter hours, dark-filled hours. Here comes the night, give me a light. You're a stranger here I'm a stranger too... Petrakis said there's some Nigerian girl on her way. Her name's Angeliki. Born in Congo to a Greek father. Whatever... Agni, I'd like a word. Things aren't going so well. What things? Have a seat. The club's losing money. We're full every night. Most just come to look. They don't order drinks; maybe one, if that. They don't even ask for lap dances. - The credit crunch, huh? - Whatever it is, we're losing money. Omer, why are you telling me all this? I can't keep you on. I don't believe it. Omer... We've been working together for 7 years. I made this place what it is. You just bought a Nigerian and you say you're losing money? You wanna get rid of me? Give it to me straight! Be a man! - I'm 35 and I'm all washed up? - I'm losing money, what can I do? And that Congolese? Is she cheaper you fuck?! - Agni, calm down! - My name is Agnieszka! You named me Agni [pure] to get the customers hard... I'm 35 years old, Omer, what am I to do? Move to the sticks and make a living blowing rednecks? I'm done with that shit! You're all the same, you fuckers! - Petrakis! - I'm not going back! - I'm not going back to that shit! - Petrakis! - Agni, come on. - Agnieszka, fuckface! You're all the same! And what about my little boy? What about my son? Agni! C'mon... To hell with you, you fucking Albanian! You made some dough and you think you're a businessman! You're no better than all those Greek redneck shits! Nothing but shit! ...to erase the memories and responsibilities for your actions... MAFIA, NEONAZIS & COPS ALL DRINK FROM THE SAME CUP Punk-ass kids, not a single wall untouched. Hungry? - There's lentil soup in the fridge. - Let's order in. - What are you insinuating? - Cooking's not your strong suit, kid. Came all the way here to insult me, big bro? Guys, can we go through? Bastard cop! Fuck the police! And then they say the uniform's a pussy magnet. Everyone thinks you're a cop. They're just itching to kick your face in. - What happened to the Taurus? - That relic? I traded it in for this. The 20-21? No, the 17... A bit older, but a classic piece Here's the thing, big brother... I'm 45... 47... 46 and a bit. The bulb's burned out. I haven't got a girlfriend, I wake up when the vamps come out when normal people are in bed, getting laid. Take a load off. D'you want one? No. And the worst thing is... I don't even feel like jerking off anymore. We gonna order in or what? People wanna see something different. Like last year, that gig with the reindeers. What? No, that was expensive. I told you, something different. Maybe something traditional. Something cheap. A naked Santa Claus... Lots of naked Santa Clauses. Girls, you moron, handing out presents. Put on your seat belt. I don't know... condoms. Those cheap ones. Strawberry. Some people are happy. Some people don't have problems. - Dad for example had God. - Our old man was an alcoholic. - Exactly, he was a happy man. - Not if you asked his liver. Priests don't have problems. What are you talking about? We all have problems. Yeah... I guess. ...at this very moment our society is falling apart... Do you remember, two years ago... that money I lent you? Yeah... 7,000. 8,000. Yeah, d'you need it? I might be able to round it up. In a month or so... ...maybe. You wouldn't have any cash on you? - How much? - I wouldn't ask... - 100? 200? - ...but something's come up. 230? That's all I got. Forget it. What? Your shoelace is undone. These fucking shoes are brand new. You had trouble with your shoelaces, even as kid. - And you with your suspenders. - They pissed me off. So you kept stretching them. I liked to pee naked; rainman style... - In the summer. - Which summer? - Back then. - Back when? We'd go out onto the balcony and pull down our shorts. You're nuts! Don't you remember? We'd take out our dicks... they were only little peckers then and we'd pee through the railings, watering the garden like a fountain... - from up high. - You're full of shit. I think of the rainman style... I often think of it. I miss it. What's with the light? The bulb's burned out. Rainman or regular? - Regular. - Okay then... There's plenty of light on the balcony. The words to the song of our love... TUESDAY 16:53 The customer is always right When that summer went by and love was over before it began. That summer... CD, my friend? Anna, Despina, Peggy, Elena, Ketoula [Greek pop stars]? Nope Any Panos Kiamos, bro? - Which album? - His latest one. How much? Seven Four Seven Five Seven Six Seven Forget it. Anything you say. Let's go. I've got the address. Verdammte scheisse... Seven euros? What happened? What the fuck's this world coming to, ya know? It's not coming, my boy. It's been there all along. Hey, Alexandros... When? Okay, I'll be there. Can we meet now? HOPE INVINCIBLE SPARTAN This must be the place. Go on... What the hell are you looking at? - Why don't you go? - Because you're going. Why? Because! I don't need a reason. I wouldn't mind a reason. Why don't we both go, ya know? It's early. We'll wait. Fine. Fine... Take off those shades, boy; it's getting dark... Hey chief, what's going down? I'm gonna charge you an extra fiver. Stagflation... Do you have change? Do I look like a kiosk? Here. Compliments of the kiosk. What did you expect? Gum? - I don't smoke. - It'll loosen you up. It'll put me to sleep. Chief, you don't look like you're getting much sleep. Try and relax. I am relaxed. The customer is always right. He can't hear it? What does he mean? So what happens now? With that creaking sound! With him it's always the grounding. What fucking grounding?! How was the party? I sent him off with the Serbs. The others? I hope they don't show up wasted. We open in two hours. Right... Okay, okay. Fuck you, assholes! You fucked him over, man! I hope the fucker dies! Cocksucker! Don't just stand there! Search him! Hey, motherfucker! You're dead, you son of a bitch! You're gonna die, asshole! Go on, run you pussy! Die! Hey... I don't have time. Can you come down? What the hell happened? Nothing. Some kids... were playing. What? Rockball? Are you okay? Do you have the papers? And 2,000 euros. It means a lot... Thanks. You sure you're okay? You know how some people... when something bad is going to happen to them they think or see bad things happening right in front of them? - What kind of things? - Things that may not exist. Like what? - Like... people dying. - People dying? Yes, you know they say some people see their own death. Are you on something? It's probably lack of sleep. I don't know if this is what you're talking about... but when my cousin died, I kept seeing him in front of me. What d'you mean? He died of leukemia; he was 25. It's been years. He was in the hospital. One day he told me that when he got out... ...he'd like us to go to the spa in Edipsos. And d'you know what I said? Like an idiot... I said we couldn't because it was too expensive. I don't even know why I said it. Years later, I could still see the look on his face. All he wanted was something to look forward to. Alexandros... if anything happens, I want you to... I know you'll stand by Sophia and the kids. What could possibly happen? Cut the crap. You'll sign and everything will be over. - You want me to come along? - Better not. The Romanian's weird. Okay then... I guess Sophia told you she came to see me this morning. - If that's what it is, don't worry. - She mentioned something. - Okay... - What? - Nothing... - What? She wants a divorce. She says things aren't good between you two. - She's seeing someone. - Is she in love with him? With her therapist? No need to worry about that now. I'll talk to her, she'll calm down and think it over. You just get done with this tonight. Did you ever figure it out? What? Why you said what you said... ...to your cousin? TUESDAY 19:19 You are responsible INVINCIBLE SPARTAN Fuck off... Asshole! - May I help you? - The 5:30 class? It was over 20 minutes ago. Who are you looking for? - Where is my son? - Just a moment. Honey, that's not the way to go... - I said, where the fuck is my son?! - What are you doing? My son! Where is he? - This is no way to... - It's my way! I pay you people 200 fucking euros a month. For an hour and a half you're responsible! - He's not here. - I can see that! He left with the two men you sent. Are you out of your fucking mind? You know I always pick him up! Jesus fucking Christ! Please sir, calm down. What men? Have you seen them before? - No. - I was 10 minutes late... 10 minutes! And you let him go! He's seven years old! You're responsible. - Calm down, sir. - And it was 20, not 10 seconds... - ...minutes, I mean. - No, I won't calm down! - I want you to find my son. Now! - Please calm down, sir. Fuck you people! 200 fucking euros a month, you cunts! For an hour and a half you're responsible! - Let go of me! - I asked you to calm down! Let me go, you fucker! Calm down first, then I'll let you go. - Okay, okay. - I don't think so. Okay. Okay, okay... I was 10 minutes late... You're responsible... You're responsible. Sophia, it's me. I just wanted to... Call me back when you get this. Bye. A stormy discussion in Parliament... is underway prior to the voting of the austerity package... culminating at midnight with a roll-call vote... that is turning into yet another suspense thriller. Barricades, stone-hurling, tear gas, body to body combat... and smashed-in bank windows... as the government and the opposition exchanged recriminations... concerning the stance of the police while once again the city-sponsored Christmas tree... was torched by protesters in front of the Greek Parliament... EDIPSOS SPA What can I get you, my friend? Could you come back? I'm waiting for a friend. I mean, someone. I'm waiting for someone. Hey, Panos... It's your father! Tell your mum, 'cause I can't reach her... tomorrow we'll go to the school together, as I promised. If things get busy at the club, I'll come straight home. What do you mean I don't have to come? Fine! We'll discuss it in the morning. Petrakis, listen. Call Agni and tell her... I was wrong. Tell her Omer was wrong. Tell her to come to work, as usual. Thanks, my boy... Oh, and, just so you know... I'll probably be late... You're responsible, you fucks! You're responsible! Go for it! Vassos. - Spyros my man, what's up? - Hello boys. This is little Lefteris. He's gonna keep us company until daddy comes. - He's a quiet one. - A real good boy, ya know? Spyros, grab us three ouzos... ...and a "gazoza" for the little guy. - What's a gazoza? That... white drink. Whatchamacallit, the fizzy stuff. - Seven Up. - Sprite? Yeah, that's it. D'you want one? What time's my daddy coming? I have orange soda too. Non-carbonated. - Epsa [Greek soda]? - Eps-cuse me?! Speak of the devil... - Stelios, look after the boy. - What d'you mean? Keep him close. And don't let him go! My son! Where's my son, you fucks? I don't have any more fucking money. I told you! No more money! What are you gonna do to me? Go on, fuck me up... - Fuck me up! - Omer, you asshole... - It doesn't work that way. - How does it work then? Fuck me up, goddammit! Fuck me up! Or I swear to God, I'll fuck you! My son, you fucks! You're responsible! - What happened, you moron?! - That guy just shot him. - What did you do?! - It's not my fault! You saw it! He was a raving maniac, ya know? - Watch the boy. - We'll sit here, together. - Call an ambulance. - No way! - The man's dying! - They'll throw us all in jail! You're responsible... You're responsible... I'll take him myself! Help me put him in the car. Stelios, I'm not saying it again. It's over... It's over. Let's get rid of him... before the whole neighborhood sees us. What about the boy? TUESDAY 21:33 When you get well, we'll go to the spa The sky ends here the world's dark here the night unfolds here. Here, where our love ends... your destiny, your way... your fate, tonight you choose. You take my breath on your laugh and you leave... The Romanian said to put it off until later tonight. This is where you drop off the boy. One of our men will be waiting for you there. 17 Pondou Street. - And then what? That's none of your business. You just hand him over. I don't understand. What should we do? Take him back to his mummy? Hello, we killed your husband but we've brought back your son, ya know? You just hand him over. Stelios, it's simple. Don't mess up. - Why me? - Why not you? - Why involve me? - You are already involved! And don't worry. The boy will be fine, all right? Are you keeping that as a souvenir? Do we have a shovel? A shovel, to dig with! Schaufel... I told them to bring equipment. Enough! There's no washing this shit out! Where do you live? You don't say much, huh? I can't go home... You mean, you don't remember the address? No... Your mum? Is she home? No. She's in Albania; with my brother. When do they get back? I don't know. She and dad aren't speaking. Great... Any suggestions? You better wait there. Okay? Wait here, okay? He's a complete moron... ...and a cheapskate. Lefteris? Sweetie, what are you doing here? Come on, let's go inside. 17 years ago... ...when I decided to open a live jazz club... ...all my friends asked me the same thing: Stelios, man, are you crazy? 17 years later I found the answer: Yes, I'm crazy! Figured it out did you, Einstein?! Yeah... it took me a while... But I figured it out. And I realized I will be here every night. We will all be here... We're responsible... Because we all love, and will always love good music... ...don't laugh, don't laugh... Our first sound system was installed in '93. It was top of the line, at the time... We changed the console in 2004, during the Olympics. Midas, Verona IP. Very expensive. No other club in Athens had one. The speakers and the amplifier we replaced in 2006. Something went wrong... something with the grounding. For the past four years... I've been tearing out the sockets in this place. And then... the bass sometimes creaks... Never mind, Stelios! Who cares if the treble creaks as well! Yes... Right... Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce for the first time in Greece, Serbia's No. 1 jazz band. 12 years making music together, 17 albums countless re-releases featured in dozens of international jazz collections. Ladies and gentlemen, the Beograd Jazz Quintet! I didn't realize they were so well-known. They're good. Very good. We're pretty full tonight. Not really. Maybe a bit better than last night. Mr. Stelios, we have a situation. I didn't forget... - That's not what I... - 2,000 like I promised. Thank you so much! I'll pay you back immediately... - I mean, as quickly as I can. - I'm not going anywhere. Mr. Stelios, I meant... they won't change the hotel room. The offer's only good for... Fuck them! I'm not working with them again. Making us look like fools! - They say there's an outstanding debt. - Yeah, yeah, fine... We've got a crowd tonight. We have a crowd! I'll talk to the Havana myself! The room... I want you to change it now! Yes, there's a problem... Sophia I don't have to explain to you! I'll talk as I please! Yes, I'll hold... I made a polite request. I asked for a room with a view and you ignored me. I don't give a shit about the offer! So now you're doing me a favor! I can choose any goddamn hotel I want! I don't owe anyone anything! I'm a professional goddammit! I love what I do. I take pride in my work! So should you! We've been working together for six years! And you fuck me over like that? For 1,000 euros you made me look like a fool? Merry fucking Christmas to you too! - You're responsible... - What? You're responsible. You'd better wait there, okay? Your shoelaces are undone... Sophia... Please don't get mad. There's blood on the rug. It's not mine. It's not real. None of this is real. When you get well, we'll go to the spa. I fucked up. I'm sorry... What? What's wrong? What are you looking at? Won't you tell me? D'you know what my brother and I would do in the summer? - What? - We'd walk around the house barefoot. The floor was marble and cement and it felt cool when the weather got hot. - What made you think of that now? - I don't know... Our grandma wouldn't let us. When she saw us without flip-flops she'd start yelling. But now it's winter... Why? You wanna give it a try? ...and those marble floors don't exist anymore. Won't the carpet do? We're not seeing each other again. You're kidding me. - The world's turned on its head. - What's that supposed to mean? - Everything's going haywire... - And you go back to your wife. What are you staring at? What are you staring at?! Say something! - You don't love her. - What do you know? - You know you don't belong there. - Only I know where I belong... ...the sheep with the sheep and the wolves with the wolves. - You know you'll be back. - This time it's different. The world's turned on its head and I'm turning with it. You'll turn right back to me. You always do. WEDNESDAY 03:12 The Useless and the Hungry Tonight the darkness wraps around me with its heavy clouds of gray. SLOW DOWN LOW VISIBILITY The ones I loved have all gone away and pain's my only company. I thirst so for my dream of old... So how did you two meet, anyway? You mean me and the Artist? Business acquaintances. Import-export. - Coke or smack? - Hell no! What d'you take us for? Fur. You're kidding me. My boy... there was a time when Russians and Romanians would kill for the eyes of a broad and a quality fur coat. Something to show off at the high end clubs. The fur or the broad? Trucks would leave Kastoria filled with fruit. Peaches, apples, all kinds of shit... And under the crates were fur coats. Lots of them. - We'd pay off the guys at customs. - Was it good money? The goose that laid the golden egg. But then the Perestroika came along - The Pere-what? - The downfall... ...animal rights activists and cheap synthetic fur. - The fur factories went out of business. - Bullshit What was that? We were just kids. All you do is spray it on, and the dirt's gone. - Meaning? - We made easy money. But it was even easier to blow it. I don't know what we were thinking. We were riding high. I guess so. We thought we'd live the big life... ...and all that bullshit. There's that moment, you know... ...when you think you're going to make it. You're 20, 25 and you have all the time in the world to get there. You're in no hurry you're feeling strong and anything seems possible. But no one tells you the truth. The time you've been given is not enough. It never is... It was never enough to begin with even though it always seems like it is. That, my friend... ...is the biggest con of them all and by the time you realize it, it's already too late. Shit... It's raining again. Scheiss regen... I can't see a damn thing, ya know? There's this new invention: Windshield wipers. The blades... ...need changing. ...to try and hide my tears. Oh God, my life is gone... What's up, boys? Still here? Yeah, still here... ...adding to the family income. See ya later alligators... The alligators are breathing down our necks, ya know. They're slack... ...play me a song of death... We'll be right up with the Artist. You motherfucker! Wanna get us both killed? What did you do with the boy? - I keep sticking my neck out for you. - What did you ever do for me? I'm doing all I can to make the Romanian keep you. - Keep me? - Yeah, to run the club. I'm feeding him this line you're the best man for the job. I don't know. What d'you mean you don't know? Are you fucked in the brain? The Romanian will take it as an insult. I'll bury you if you hang me out to dry! I vouched for you again! This is the last fucking time! And keep your mouth shut about the boy. We'll go find him later, you and me. No. What d'you mean "no"? We're responsible. Responsible? For what, you fucking moron?! For that shitty little brat?! Stelios, it's really simple. Do you want to keep the club and come out of this alive? Then shut the fuck up... and do exactly as I say! And you should thank me... that it's not your kid. This is the last time, Stelios... ...for old time's sake. Where did you two go? - To look for umbrellas. - It's not raining. - We didn't find any. - It stopped. So much the better. What's up, Vassos? - The usual... - That's about right... The Useless and the Hungry, Stelios. You know how it is... The usual... It's going to rain. What's his problem, ya know? The altitude. He says you look anxious. You shouldn't be. You're a businessman, just like he is. This is business... and I've told him he can still count on you. He knows you've asked to work for us... and he appreciates the fact that you helped us out tonight... and it'll be Christmas soon... Yes... This isn't rain. In Romania it rains non-stop. Real rain. Adrian here doesn't like the rain. Adrian is his son. He moved to Athens for the sunshine. Humidity is bad for his lungs. He bought this site so Adrian can have a place to stay... ...a home and an office. Adrian will take over the club. The two of you will work together. The papers. They'll get wet. Thank you. Here, I'll hold it for you. No, it's okay. Stelios, he'll hold it while you take out the papers. I can do it on my own, thanks. Let me take a look. What for? Unless they're in Romanian. His son has a lot of ideas for the club. He knows... ...he ran their club in Bucharest. At night people like to dance: Disco, R'n'B, house but mostly local music... I think he means "Greek pop". Live music is expensive, he says. And you can't dance to jazz. He says jazz is for niggers... ...and French intellectuals! WEDNESDAY 04:45 You can dance to jazz The rain has come again. The moon is gone now. Our hearts will feel the sweet caress of love. The rain's getting stronger. The soul is all alone waiting for the rain to bring hope of a loving mate. I love you, I love you. Far away from you I cannot bear to be... What the fuck are you doing?! You fucked it all up, Artist. All of it... - ...there's no point any more. - Get up. Let's go. Take it. Take it! You're out of bullets. Get yourself to a hospital. You won't get far with a bullet in your belly. It's nothing. As long as you bleed, you're alive. Yeah... That's what we used to say. And I thought you'd gone soft on me. - How about you? - I think I'll sit here for a while... and rest... You fucked it all up... There's no point... What the fuck? Is it snowing? I don't think so. Sleet, maybe. BROTHER Hello? Did you happen to see my gun? - Your gun? - Yeah, did you take it? Stelios, where the hell are you? And what the fuck are you up to? POLICE Your call is being diverted. Sophia... I'm on my way. And tell Panos... I'll come along. Sweetie, aren't you tired? Why won't you talk? C'mon... Get up. Let's go home. WEDNESDAY 06:14 Home Morning, buddy. Can you spare some change? Buddy, are you alive? What happened? Beats me. They set the Christmas tree on fire. What, here in the suburbs? Yep. It went up like a Roman candle! Can you spare some change? C'mon, it won't kill you. Those who touch me don't die. Hey man, have a merry Christmas! I know what you're thinking... There was a moment... a certain summer perhaps... when you were sure... ...you were going to make it. You think to yourself... that you probably took your time and maybe in the end you fell asleep along the way. Now you think to yourself that you are home it's winter and those marble floors don't exist anymore. If you look at the clock... you'll try to remember... ...exactly how time flew by. But it's too late... to be angry... because you failed to see the truth. And all you want... is to just stay there... for a little while longer. That's what you're thinking now. For a little while longer. WEDNESDAY 04:45
