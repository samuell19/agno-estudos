(dramatic music) - [Announcer] The Broadway Theatre Archive. - Might be any one of us. (people laughing) (people chattering) - [Announcer] A collection of comedy and drama, available on video cassette. - As I have said, as I say for the last time, that was to me a military situation. - But this was not a military situation. Those helpless, unarmed men were not the enemy. No matter what Winder said, this was no longer a question of North and South, a question of war, but a question of human beings. Chandler saw that. The women who tried to bring that food to the starving men, they saw that! Where was your conscienc e then? - Well- - In Gen. Winder's pocket along with his keys, his tobacco, and his money, and worth no more than any of those things? - You speak high, Colonel, high! Ask them here in this room if they can say in their hearts they would have done different if they had been in my place. Ask them! (somber military music) - Hello, I'm George C. Scott. It's my happy job this evening to give you an improvisational introduction to "The Andersonville Trial" a play by Saul Levitt. I did it 10 years ago on Broadway as an actor and I directed it here for you tonight. I don't know how good it is, as far as directing assignment goes, but you'll have to be the judge of that. The cast is splendid. The play is wonderful. It means a great deal to me and I think it can mean something to you contemporaneously. It takes place 100 years ago, but what it says and what it means I think you'll understand and I sincerely hope you enjoy it. And so, "The Andersonville Trial." - [Guard] Attention! (people chattering) - This military court convened by order of the War Department is now in session. (gavel thuds) The lieutenant in charge is advised to post additional guards in the corridor. A lane is to be kept open at all times to courtroom doors. - [Lieutenant] Yes, sir. - I take it all concerned with these proceedings have signed the necessary oath of allegiance to the government of the United States. - [Clerk] Yes, sir. - Lieutenant Colonel N.P. Chipman for the War Department. Mr. Otis Baker for the Defense. The defendant Henry Wirz is to be tried by this military commission consisting of Gen. Mott, Gen. Thomas, Gen. Geary, Gen. Fessenden, Gen. Ballier, Colonel Allcock, Colonel Stibss, and myself, Gen. Wallace. (sighs) Has the Defense any objection to any of its members? - No objection. - Well, I don't see the defendant. - If the Court please, Capt. Williams is here, will explain his absence. - Sir, regarding the defendant, he will be here shortly. - Is he ill? - No sir, he is temporarily indisposed following his attempt on his own life early this morning which was quickly foiled by the alertness of the guards, sir. - Mr. Wirz attempted to take his life? - [Capt. Williams] Unsuccessfully, sir. - Captain, you will explain to this Court how such an attempt could have possibly occurred. - Yes, sir. Mr. Wirz tried to slash his wrists after breaking a bottle. - [Gen. Wallace] A bottle? - Yes, sir, a brandy bottle which he receives daily as a stimulant by order of Dr. Ford. - This incident should not have happened. You are charged with custody of the prisoner. You will take necessary steps to see it does not happen again. - [Capt. Williams] Yes, sir. - However, you say the prisoner is in condition to appear shortly. - Yes, sir, in a few minutes and I will personally escort him to this Court. - Thank you, that'll be all. - [Capt. Williams] Yes, sir. - I will now ask defense counsel to plead to the indictment in the absence of the defendant. - We would prefer if the Court will permit that Capt. Wirz hear the charges against him directly. - This trial has been postponed several times. The Court intends to proceed without further delay. Will counsel plead to the charge? - Counsel will plead. - If the Judge Advocate is ready. - [Col. Chipman] Ready, sir. - The indictment will be read. - Yes, sir. Charge, criminal conspiracy to destroy the lives of soldiers of the United States in violation of the laws and customs of war. Specification that Henry Wirz, who was in charge of the Confederate prison at Andersonville, Georgia, did keep in barbarously close confinement federal soldiers up to the number of 40,000 without adequate shelter against the burning heat of summer or the cold of winter. Add specification that said Henry Wirz, in carrying out this conspiracy, did not provide the prisoners of war with sufficient food, clothing, or medical care causing them to languish and die to the number of more than 14,000. Specification, that he established a line known at the dead-line and that he instructed the prison guards stationed on the walls of the prison stockade to fire upon and kill any prisoner who might pass beyond that dead-line. Specification, that he used bloodhounds to hunt down, seize, and mangle escaping prisoners of war and through these various causes bringing about the deaths of about 50 federal soldiers, their names unknown. Specification, that through direct order and/or by his own hand brought about the murder of 13 prisoners, their names unknown. - Mr. Baker, pleading for the prisoner, how do you plead to the charge? - We interpose a motion that this military court discharge itself as being without proper jurisdiction now that the war is over. - This Court has jurisdiction under the war powers of the president which are still in force. It is well-known that diehard rebel officers still refuse to lay down their arms. Officially and in fact the war continues. Move to deny. (gavel thuds) - Motion is denied. - Motion to postpone on the grounds that potential witnesses who in more normal time might speak for the defendant, refuse to do so for fear of being misunderstood as signifying support for the late Confederacy. - If Mr. Baker's witnesses can in good conscience sign the oath of loyalty to the government of the United States, they have nothing to fear. - The Court is aware of the temper of the times. It is only been four short months since Mr. Lincoln was assassinated. (gavel thudding) - [Gen. Wallace] Mr. Baker, will leave that name out of this trial. - Nevertheless, Mr. Lincoln's presence is felt in this room and his murder is felt in this room and it swells the charge of murder against the defendant to gigantic size. - For which the Southern cause is responsible. Defense counsel will not turn Mr. Lincoln's tragic death to his advantage here. - My general concern, sir, is that the indictment leaves out Capt. Wirz's military superiors making him the single target of the national mood of vengeance against the South. (gavel thudding) - That will be all, Mr. Baker. The motion is denied. Now if you have no further motions- - I do. As to the specifications alleging the charge of murder and abetting murder against certain persons, move to strike them since no persons are named. - Counsel cannot with his motions dispose of the horror of 14,000 unknown dead dumped into unmarked graves at Andersonville. Better records were kept of bales of cotton. Move to deny. - Will the Judge Advocate tell us where accurate prison records were kept during the war? The Judge Advocate owes me common courtesy here. A person accused of crimes punishable by death is entitled to a proper defense. - We know what is being defended here. Counsel's political motives are well-understood. (gavel thudding) - [Gen. Wallace] Change will stop. - I only remind the Judge Advocate that he is now in a court of law and no longer on the battlefield. He behaves as if the horror of war was not universal. The North had its Andersonvilles. - The government of the United States is not on trial here, Mr. Baker. - Well, that remains to be seen. - Mr. Baker- - Meaning no offense to the Court. That remark stated in full would have been, that remains to be seen through the testimony that will be offered here. I was referring to what the record will show, sir. - The Court is not misled, Mr. Baker. In the future you will exercise care in your remarks to this Court. The motion is denied. (gavel thuds) - Prisoner to the Court. - [Gen. Wallace] If you have no further motions, I will order the defendant to plead to the charge. - No further motions but if it please the Court, we have made a special request of the Judge Advocate on behalf of the defendant which he has apparently forgotten. - It has been requested that the defendant be allowed to recline on a sofa during the proceedings on his claim of great pain and weakness due to a so-called war wound. - Not so-called, Colonel. I was a soldier in the line. I was honorably wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines- - [Col. Chipman] The defendant is not the only man in this room to bear to scars of war. - I will not be slandered. - Permission is granted for the prisoner to recline during the proceedings. And he will now plead. - I thank you, General. I would like to make a statement, sir, as- - You will be given an opportunity to do so, Mr. Wirz. - [Mr. Wirz] As for my attempt on my own life this morning, if the Court is interested. - Very well, make your statement. - It was not guilt of conscience that drove me to that act. I have no guilt of conscience, none whatsoever. - [Gen. Wallace] If that's all you have to say, Mr. Wirz. - Just a few words more, sir. I calmly sized up the situation as a soldier. As I see it, I have simply no chance whatsoever. And I decided not to give the government the satisfaction of- - That'll be all, Mr. Wirz. - [Mr. Wirz] One other matter, sir. (gavel thudding) - That will be all. - Then the Court will not permit me to mention a personal matter which should be of concern to this Court. (gavel clattering) - Very well. What is it? - I write letters to my family and I do not know if they are received. - The Court has nothing to do with the mails, Mr. Wirz. Possibly your letters are delayed. After all, conditions are still unsettled. - General, I was taken from the midst of my family without warning and under the eyes of my children arrested. I do not care what the newspapers call me. Let them call me the Butcher of Andersonville. But what my children think of their father, that is important to me. I have the right to present myself to my children as I wish. I have that right. It is a cruelty that I do not know if my letters are received. - If you wish, Mr. Wirz, we will see to it that your letters go to your home by military packet. - I thank the Court most kindly. They have been most considerate of me. The medical care, the spiritual comfort of the priest who is permitted to visit me daily in my cell. The Court has been most kind. All that is wanted of me is my life! I am not fooled by... (gavel thudding) - Will this Court make due allowance for the strain that the defendant is obviously under? - The defense counsel must share guilt with the prisoner for that outburst. - Everything is conspiracy in the eyes of the Judge Advocate. I am not here to make your case, sir, much as you would like. - [Col. Chipman] I would like you to be- - [Mr. Baker] And I would like to remind you that normal courtroom behavior- - Nothing is normal here. - That normal courtroom behavior calls for the outward appearance, I don't care what you think, that one's opponent is acting in good faith. - But I cannot assume, sir, since I know where you stand. - And where is that, Colonel? - The side of those who secretly opposed this government when it was fighting for its life. Who pays you here? - Not the government. - No, not this government but the remnants of that other, still active. - The Judge Advocate is suspicious of my politics and wants to know who pays me. If the Court will permit, I will oblige the Judge Advocate. I am paid by a committee formed to defend Capt. Wirz. I take my cases where I find them subject to one condition, that I must feel that there's a shade, the smallest shade of doubt as to a man's guilt. Regarding my politics, in my home city of Baltimore, a city of divided loyalty, some held that I was an enemy to the Confederate side because I felt that slavery was not worth dying for since it is an unworkable institution doomed for extinction anyway. And then there were the others who suspected me of being lukewarm as to the glorious future that would follow a Northern victory. (chuckles) The Colonel might make his own position clearer. (audience chattering) - It was natural for me to go to war against a cause that wished to perpetuate human bondage. And I'm here in the service of the Union seeking justice for those men barbarously murdered by that Southern cause. I am personally involved here, Mr. Baker, if you are not. - As a lawyer, as a clerk under orders to process Wirz through to the hangman. (chuckles) As I thought. We can make the bull charge. - Well, I take it, gentlemen are through. Under military law, we could, of course, dispense with defense counsel. The defendant would not have to be present and this case could be heard in a small room. But the government has seen fit to set it here in a court of claims and before an audience. Conceding the temper of the times and the emotions of all parties, we intend to hold this trial within bounds. I do not further advise the testing of the power of this Court to maintain order. Now, the defense counsel has stated he has no further motions. I will now order the defendant to plead to the charge. Prisoner, how do you plead? - The prisoner enters a plea of not guilty to the charge and to all specifications. - [Gen. Wallace] The Judge Advocate may summon his first witness. - On the general charge of criminal conspiracy we summon Mr. D.T. Chandler. - [Guard] Mr. D.T. Chandler. - Baker, you have all the necessary documents? - Yes. - Yes, including the evidence that I allowed the youngest Northern prisoners out on parole. You remember, I let them out to pick blackberries. - I know, I know. - Do you solemnly swear that evidence you give- - But it will do no good. I must die. - The Court shall be the truth, the whole truth- - Really, I must die. - And nothing but the truth so help you God? - [Col. Chandler] I do. - The real crime I have committed here, Baker, you know what it is, of course. - Well? - That I chose the losing side. (chuckles) - Before we begin we must state briefly the rule of evidence applying in cases of criminal conspiracy. The evidence of a common design is sufficient to convict and we will prove that such a common design existed at Andersonville to which the defendant willingly lent himself. Mr. Chandler, where were you employed in the year 1864? - I served in the Army of the Confederacy with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. - And what was your official function? - I was assigned by the War Office to inspect and report on all of the military prisons maintained by the Confederacy. - Were you at any time in the Andersonville military stockade at Sumter County, Georgia? - Yes, sir. There had been civilian reports filed into Richmond. - How long were you there? - Two weeks. - I ask you, Mr. Chandler, if this is a fair map of the Andersonville stockade? - [Col. Chandler] Yes it is. - Will you describe its dimensions, its area? - On the long side, a thousand feet from north to south. 800 feet from east to west, comprising an area of about 16 acres of ground. - What was the nature of the terrain? - Simply earth, bare ground. - Was this the condition of the terrain in advance of it being a site for the camp? - [Col. Chandler] No, sir. It was originally part of a section of pine woods. - And what can you tell us about the climate in that part of Georgia? I refer now to extremes of temperature, summer heat, winter cold. - July and August it can be quite hot, over a hundred degrees. Winters, near freezing, rainy. - And was this camp laid out with a provision for shelter of any kind? - [Col. Chandler] No, sir. - Will you describe this outer stockade line? - That was a wall some 15 to 20 feet high made out of rough-hewn timbers and there was a platform run around the top of it. And there were sentry boxes at intervals. - And this inner line? - [Col. Chandler] That was a line of posts parallel to the outer line about 25 feet inside of it. - It had a name, did it not? - [Col. Chandler] The dead-line, yes, sir. So called because if a prisoner went beyond it, he could be shot by the guard. - [Col. Chipman] And this meandering line here? - [Col. Chandler] That would be the stream that ran through the camp entering under the west wall of the stockade emerging under the east side wall. - Its width and depth? - [Col. Chandler] No more than a yard wide and a foot deep. Marshy areas around the stream. - That marshy area could better be called a swamp, could it not? - [Col. Chandler] A swamp, yes, sir. - Of what size? - 150, 50 feet, on either side of the stream. - [Col. Chipman] Having a considerable oozy depth, did it not? - Person venturing to cross it might sink up to his waist. That would be the cook house. The burial yard. The dead house. That's the main entrance to the camp. - Thank you, Mr. Chandler. Now would you tell us something of the history of this camp? Will you state the circumstances under which it was established? - Toward the latter part of '63, all of the military prisons maintained by the Confederacy were overcrowded. The War Office decided to create a new camp. - And who was responsible for its establishment? - [Col. Chandler] Gen. John H. Winder. - Now deceased. - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - And what was his official function? - Gen. Winder was in charge of all of the military prisons for the Confederacy east of the Mississippi. - And you have stated that this site that the camp was located on was originally part of a pine wood. The cutting down of every tree that could have provided shade, was Gen. Winder responsible for that? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - So this site and the arrangements made for the care of the prisoners was known to and approved of by your War Office. - I don't know with what knowledge or approval. The Colonel knows how a line of command works. - Wasn't it their responsibility... Withdrawn for the time being. Will you describe conditions at Andersonville as you observed them, Mr. Chandler? - [Col. Chandler] When I visited the camp, it was tightly crowded with men in the area. - Giving each man how much space would you say? - Perhaps 36 square feet per prisoner. - Space equivalent to a cell six feet on each side. - What else did you find at Andersonville? - There was a general insufficiency of food, water, and shelter. I think that would cover it. - I think not. When you say insufficiency of water, you mean that the available water supply for all purposes, for drinking, cooking, washing came from that narrow brook, isn't that so? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - And that stream at the same time was the repository for all waste matter, isn't that correct? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - All waste matter from the camp was emptied into that stream, hmm? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - [Col. Chipman] The waste from the cook house, the bodily waste of the prisoners. - Yes. - Turning that stream into a foul, sluggish sink, isn't that correct? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - And that foul, stinking stream was the total water supply for 40,000 men and that is what you mean by an insufficiency of water, isn't that so, Mr. Chandler? - Yes. - And as for the insufficiency of shelter, there was, in fact, no shelter. The men lived on bare ground winter and summer or dug themselves into the ground, into burrows, isn't that correct? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - And as to the sort of clothing the men had, please be specific, sir. - Some of the men wore shirts and trousers. - Some? You mean the newly arrived prisoners still had their shirts and trousers. - Yes, sir. - While the others, the vast number of them, were in rags, isn't that correct, Mr. Chandler? - [Col. Chandler] Yes. - You mean those men were in a state of nakedness or near-nakedness under the terrible weather conditions you've just described, isn't that correct, sir? - [Col. Chandler] Yes. - And tell us about the food. - [Col. Chandler] Mostly cornmeal. - Fine ground or course? - Unbolted meal. - Unbolted meal, meaning meal ground so course it was as good as swallowing a knife for what it did to man's insides considering the weakened condition those men were in, isn't that correct, Mr. Chandler? - Yes, sir. - Did the men have any other sort of food besides the meal? - A bit of meat now and then. - [Col. Chipman] What sort of meat? - Not very good. - Not very good. The soldiers had a joke about that meat and a grim kind of soldiers' joke to describe the meat that came from those sick and dying mules and horses. They told you that animal that meat came from had to be held up on its legs to be slaughtered, isn't that correct? - Jokes of that kind, yes, sir. - And you saw with your own eyes that it was rotten, maggot-ridden meat and that's what you mean when you say "not very good", isn't that correct, Mr. Chandler? - [Col. Chandler] Yes. - The conditions the men lived under drove them to extreme measures in order to survive, isn't that so? - Extreme, yes, sir. - To the point where they considered rats a delicacy, isn't that correct? - Yes. - To the point where when one of them died the others in the desperation they had been driven to stripped the body clean of whatever was on it in five minutes of boots, trousers if there was any. Of bread, of greenbacks to bribe the guards, anything in order to keep alive, isn't that correct, Mr. Chandler? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - Driven in their desperation to the point of cannibalism, isn't that correct, Mr. Chandler? - Yes. - You were able to establish that for a fact in your mind, Mr. Chandler? - Yes, sir. - How? As delicately as you wish. - From the condition of some of the bodies, some very rough surgery had been performed. - So in that place, men had been driven to the disposition of beasts, isn't that so, Mr. Chandler? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - And if I were to sum up Andersonville as a pit, as an animal pit where men wallowed, the sick, the dying, the insane, wallowing among the dead, would I exaggerate a picture of that place, Mr. Chandler? - No. - Concerning what you saw there, you submitted a report of recommendations to Gen. Winder and your War Office. - [Col. Chandler] Yes, I did. - Is that a copy of the report? - This is the report. - Submitted into evidence. You say in this report that Andersonville is a blot on the Confederacy. You recommend that the prisoners be transferred to other prisons without delay and that Andersonville be closed down immediately. - Yes, I did. - [Clerk] Exhibit one for the Government. - And this report was ignored, was it not? Ignored, disregarded, the conditions allowed to remain? - Colonel, I didn't come here to indict the leaders of the cause for which I fought as plotting the murder of defenseless men. - Your report revealing how Winder and Wirz were operating that camp was ignored. - I've told you, I could not endure Andersonville. But you people act as though you were better human beings than we were. - No, but our cause was. Your report was ignored. - Due to the crisis, the bitterness, the disorder, with Gen. Sherman marching through Georgia burning his way. - Your report was ignored! - [Col. Chandler] As your officers would have ignored it, too, sir, if it had been Gen. Lee marching through Pennsylvania to New York! (gavel thudding) - Mr. Chandler. - Difficult situation for me. - Nevertheless, you will answer the question. The Judge Advocate will repeat the question and you will answer it. - Mr. Chandler, your report on Andersonville was ignored, was it not? - Yes, sir. - Mr. Chandler, did Gen. Winder ever express to you his disposition towards the men? - Yes, sir. When I spoke with Gen. Winder, he had hard and bitter feelings toward the men. - How did he express those feelings? - He finally said that if half of the men died, there'd be twice as much room for those that were left. - And the half that was slated for the grave were well on their way at Andersonville. Mr. Wirz set up certain rules at the camp, rules pertaining to the punishment of prisoners attempting to escape, did he not? - Yes, sir. - His command of the camp conforming to Gen. Winder's inhuman disposition towards the men. - I must ask the Judge Advocate what he means by that suggestive, ambiguous phrase, "conforming to". - Withdrawn. Wirz's rules at Andersonville, were they rules violating the customs of war? - Well, yes. - In addition, were they cruel and inhuman rules? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - Was Wirz the personal choice by Gen. Winder for superintendent of that camp? - [Col. Chandler] Yes, sir. - That'll be all. - Col. Chandler, you made a second report on Andersonville for the Confederate War Office, did you not? - [Col. Chandler] Yes I did. - Is this a copy of that report? - [Col. Chandler] That's the report. - Submitted by the Defense, entered in evidence. - [Clerk] Exhibit number one for the Defense. - Colonel, in this report which the Judge Advocate has failed to call attention, you recommend the dismissal of Gen. Winder. - Yes, I did. - [Mr. Baker] But not of Capt. Wirz. - No, sir. - Why not? - At the time I inspected Andersonville there was nothing in Capt. Wirz's conduct, a malignant disposition toward the men, that would justify my asking for his dismissal. - I notice also in this report that you took various prisoners aside urging them to speak freely as to any instance of ill treatment by Capt. Wirz and that they had no complaints on that score. - No, sir. - So that neither you nor the prisoners, who are presumably being subjected to Capt. Wirz's cruel and inhuman treatment, blamed him for it, did you? - No, sir. - No more questions, thank you. - Mr. Chandler, very often as you know, commanders are forewarned of inspection and dress up their command in advance. Couldn't this have occurred in your case? - Perhaps. - And isn't it possible that the prisoners would fear the consequences of complaints against Wirz? The men did not know you. Wirz would still be there after you'd gone. Under the circumstances, isn't it possible that the men would not answer you truthfully? - Possibly. I did the best I could with that Andersonville situation. - And did Wirz do the best he could under the circumstances? Despite Winder's orders, couldn't he have chosen to... There are ways- - Ways of doing what? Obeying the orders of his military superiors? Now what is the Judge Advocate suggesting? - Withdrawn. Thank you, Mr. Chandler, that'll be all. - [Gen. Wallace] If there are no other questions, the witness may stand down. The Court thanks you, Col. Chandler. - We call Dr. John C. Bates. - [Guard] Dr. John C. Bates. (people chattering) - [Clerk] Solemnly swear that the evidence that you shall give to the Court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - [Dr. Bates] Swear to God. - Dr. Bates, were you in the service of the Confederate Army in 1863. - Yes, sir. - Were you at any time inside Andersonville stockade? - Yes, sir, for about eight months in '64. - What was your official function? - I was medical officer assigned to the camp by the surgeon general. I can't say I asked for it. (audience chuckling) - I'm sure not. Describe your activities there as physician. - Writing prescriptions for drugs that were not available, amputation of limbs due to gangrene, quite a lot of that. Certifying the dead in my section every morning. Quite a lot of that, too. - Did you, at any time during your stay there, make an estimate as to the rate of death in that place? - Yes, I did, sir. I had always kept a ledger book covering the ailments and treatment of my patients in civilian life for farmers, their families, their horses, too. (audience laughing) And I decided to keep some sort of a record of that camp because I was deeply shocked by that place when I came there. - [Col. Chipman] Would you please tell the Court your estimate of the rate of death? - During the spring months, 50, 60, 70 men a day. During periods of extreme heat during the summer reaching a hundred men a day. More in May than in April, more in June than in May. And during July, August, and September, 3,000 men a month were dying. - And what were the principal causes of that high rate of death? - Well, lack of sanitary facilities, lack of exercise, the anemia of men due to lack of food, rendering them subject to fatal illness from the slightest abrasion or infection. The lack of medical supplies. - Dr. Bates, in your professional opinion, of the thousands who died at Andersonville, how many would have lived if conditions had at least been sanitary? - I'd estimate, 75, 80%. - 10 to 11,000 of those 14,000 men? - [Dr. Bates] Yes, sir. - And can you think of any sanitary measures which, if taken at Andersonville, would have saved lives? - Hummer, yes, sir. - Did any of you suggest these measures to Mr. Wirz? - Yes, sir, myself, probably others. - And what did he say? - He said I was a doctor. I didn't understand his difficulties in running a huge camp like that. He was downright incoherent. He damned me for a Yankee sympathizer, cursed me out in English, German, and some other foreign dialect. - (laughing) French. That was French, Dr. Bates. - French, eh? (gavel thudding) - Keep in mind, Mr. Wirz, that your situation here is not amusing. - No, sir. And I cannot explain it to myself or to the Court why I have this feeling to laugh when I hear how I killed all those men. (laughing) Perhaps the Court can explain it. - Do not play the clown here, sir. Continue, Colonel. - Only one more question. On that not so humorous occasion when you spoke to Wirz and he complained to you of the difficulties of his job, did you understand him to mean difficult administratively or difficult humanly? - Mr. Wirz dwelt on his own difficulties not the men's. - [Col. Chipman] That'll be all. - Now, Dr. Bates. Dr. Bates, you regard yourself as a fair-minded man, do you not, Doctor? - I do. - The fact that you dislike Capt. Wirz hasn't influenced your testimony in any way here, has it? - [Dr. Bates] No, it has not. - But you did dislike him. - Well, not so as to influence my professional, objective opinion. - I now address myself to the professional, objective side of you, Doctor, and strictly to that side. So far as you know, by whose authority was the amount of food per prisoner decided on? - Commissary General in Richmond, I believe. - And not by Capt. Wirz. And by whose authority was the amount and type of medical supplies to the camp decided on? - Surgeon General. - And not by Capt. Wirz. He was responsible neither for the lack of food or the inadequate medical supply. - I would have to agree. - You would have to agree. You don't want to agree but you would have to agree, is that what you mean, Doctor? You seem to have found Capt. Wirz rather callous towards the condition of the prisoners, Doctor. - [Dr. Bates] This was my honest impression. - Well, we're all entitled to our honest impressions, Doctor. I seem to recall your saying a few minutes ago how shocked you were at the high rate of death at Andersonville Prison when you came there. - Deeply shocked. - Well, one can understand how unnerving that would be, Doctor. That was in what month by the way? - [Dr. Bates] In February. - And you had to face that unnerving scene day after day, month after month. (grunts) It's difficult to understand how you could do that, Doctor. - Well, sir, I had to steel myself. Gradually the shock of it became bearable. - [Mr. Baker] I'm curious, Doctor, how gradually did your feeling of shock lessen? For example, how'd you react to the dying by June let us say? - Not as much. - [Mr. Baker] And by September? - Even less. - So that by September when, as you said, 3,000 men per month were dying, you hardly reacted at all. - I meant I had grown accustomed to seeing- - Of course you had. Any human being to save his sanity would have to do that. So that Capt. Wirz's callousness in that place wasn't so strange after all, was it, Doctor? - Well, my impression of Mr. Wirz remains the same despite that. - Thank you, Doctor. That'll be all. - Dr. Bates, do you recall one single instance in conversing with Wirz when he made any criticism of the orders or disposition of his superiors? - Objection. Now, I find that a strange question to be asked by a counsel for the War Department, himself a soldier. Is it being held against Capt. Wirz that he did not make a public judgment of the motives of his military superiors? - The Court must agree. Wirz was not bound to comment on the orders of his military superiors. - If it please the Court, we're concerned here with the frame of mind of a man carrying out the inhuman design of his superiors. We are bound to explore his thinking when he obeyed those orders. - His thinking when he obeyed those orders! And if he didn't like those orders, what was he supposed to do, disobey them? If conscience is the measure by which a soldier obeys or disobeys, then we can hardly condemn the army officers who went over to the Confederacy since they did so on the ground of conscience. (gavel thudding) And on that ground of conscience, Robert E. Lee deserves a monument! (gavel thudding) (man laughing) - That'll be all, Mr. Baker. I am certain it was not in the mind of the Judge Advocate to raise the issue of disobedience to a superior officer. - Under certain circumstances, that issue may require consideration, sir. - Well, Colonel, the Court, of course, is not suggesting a line of inquiry the Judge Advocate is to take here. But the Court will say it is disposed to draw its own inferences to a criminal design from evidence of the defendant's words and acts and not from an examination of moral factors which can lead us into a bottomless pool of philosophic debate. I am certain the Judge Advocate will agree and that he will withdraw that question as to whether or not Wirz criticized his superior officer. - The order is withdrawn. (Gen. Wallace clears throat) Dr. Bates, you never grew so accustomed to that place as to forget your human obligations to those men, did you? You made it your daily business to bring food to those starving men, didn't you? - Of course. - And there was plenty of food in the region of Andersonville to draw on if Wirz had wished to bring it in. The yield of grain and vegetables in the region of Andersonville is considerable, isn't it? - (laughing) Is Dr. Bates put forward as qualified to testify on the agricultural situation? - Withdrawn. If the Court please, we'd like to change the order of witnesses. We'd like now to call a witness better qualified to speak with accuracy on the available food supply in the region of Andersonville. - Does defense counsel offer objection to a change in the Government witnesses? - [Mr. Baker] Not at all. - We call Ambrose Spencer to the stand. - Thank you, Dr. Bates. You may step down. - Uh, we thank the witness. - [Col. Chipman] Thank you, Dr. Bates. Mr. Spencer, where do you reside? - I reside in the town of Americus in the Sumter County. - [Col. Chipman] What is your occupation? - I operate a plantation in that county, corn, cotton, tobacco. - Is that plantation in the proximity to the Andersonville site? - I practically border it. - And you are in a position to know as well as any man the yield of grain and vegetables in the region of Andersonville? - I would say so. - [Col. Chipman] What can you tell us of the yield in the years 1863 and 1864? - Both good years. Sumter and the adjoining county, Macon, I may point out, are part of a very productive area, sometimes termed the garden of the Confederacy. - Yes, yes. We would like some details as to the yield. - Corn averaged about eight bushels to the acre. Wheat, six. Now, that's the general average but we have land in Sumter produces as much as 35 bushels to the acre you understand. - And the vegetables? - Well, there was an uncommon amount during the war. Since there was so little cotton planted, practically all the ground was put in to provisions, you see. - And if Mr. Wirz had solicited food for prisoners from the neighboring farms and plantations, what do you think would have happened? - [Dr. Bates] He would have gotten it. - How can you be so certain of that? - The proof, sir, is that without it being solicited, there were people in the vicinity who came forward and made an effort to get food into that camp. In one case a group of women in Americus, including my wife, made that attempt. - [Col. Chipman] Will you tell the Court of that occasion? - Well, sir, the ladies thought it would be the Christian thing to do having heard that the prisoners were doing so poorly. Now, they obtained enough food through contributions to fill four wagons and have them driven right- - Ah, ah, ah. How large were the wagons? - Oh, four of the largest farm wagons we could find each requiring four to six horses to pull 'em. - Making a load of how much food for the prisoners? - [Mr. Spencer] Oh maybe 20 ton. - Please continue. - But they had those driven right up to the gate of the stockade. Mr. Wirz was at the gate when the ladies arrived. He would not permit the food to be brought in. He cursed those women. He told them they were giving aid and comfort to the enemy, that the Yankees were unlawfully invading and looting the South and that those women were traitors and worse. He used the violentist and profanest language I've ever heard in a man's mouth. He said that if he had his way, he would have a certain kind of a house built for those women and he'd have 'em all put in there where Confederate soldiers would teach them a lesson in loyalty in a hurry and teach it to 'em in a way they wouldn't forget. (audience laughing) - Yes, we understand the remark. These women were turned away by Mr. Wirz from giving food to starving men. - Yes, sir, they were turned away and they wept. - And if Mr. Wirz had solicited food on Christian grounds and on behalf of the good name of the Confederacy, you think that would have brought in large amounts of food. - [Mr. Spencer] I'm certain the people of Georgia would have responded, yes, sir. - You knew the defendant, do you not? - I knew him quite well. - [Col. Chipman] And you knew Gen. Winder well? - Knew him, too. - Yes, from your knowledge, what can you tell us about Gen. Winder's disposition towards the prisoners? - When they came there once Winder said that the Yankees had come south to take possession of the land and he was endeavoring to satisfy them by giving them each a small plot pointing to the grave site. - Did you ever hear Wirz express himself along similar lines? - Well, I can tell you that he stated that he wished all those men in hell. Boasted that he was killing more Yankees at Andersonville than Lee was at Richmond. - [Col. Chipman] You heard those remarks. - Yes, sir, to wipe out all those men, that was the schemes. - [Col. Chipman] That'll be all. - That was my scheme, you say? So to wipe out all those men, on my head, all those men? (gavel thudding) - [Gen. Wallace] Mr. Wirz. - I was a man like other men. (gavel thudding) - Mr. Baker, you will please restrain the defendant. - Who will understand? An ordinary man like me assigned- - Baker, you will please restrain the- Drummer boys. I saved, I'm surrounded- - Captain, Captain Wirz... - [Dr. Ford] A bottle of brandy in the bag. - [Soldier] Grab his feet, grab his feet. (audience chattering) - I ask for a postponement. - Well, Dr. Ford? - A fainting spell, General, from which he recovers. He's lacking in strength and suffers from strain but he should be able to continue I suppose. - We hope so. Mr. Baker, this trial must go on. - If the Court please- - No use, Mr. Baker. - Well, the open bias of the witness is a case in point. I need not remind this Court of the bitterness in our time. - It is no use, Mr. Baker. - [Mr. Baker] Even the sight of a tattered Confederate blouse is cause for a riot in the streets. The very air is charged. - We are not empowered to move this trial into the next century. This trial will continue. You will make it clear to the defendant that should there be another demonstration here in this courtroom, he will be tried in absentia. (gavel thuds) - In absentia, Latin for absence. I understand all languages but the language of this trial- - This Court has suffered a sufficient provocation to send Capt. Wirz from the room but I suggest that it does not. - [Gen. Wallace] You suggest we do not? - Since it is not he alone in this room who was stripped down in naked hatred and anger. - You, counsel, will cross-examine or stand down. (loud thudding) - Counsel will cross-examine. Now, Mr. Spencer, you don't regard yourself as prejudiced against Capt. Wirz, do you? - I don't. - Then why is it that you have chosen to leave out of that touching tale about those women bringing food to that camp the fact that Gen. Winder was there at the time. It was he who ordered that food kept out. - Why? - Yes, why? You were there at the main gate of that camp together with those other civilians when you heard Gen. Winder say loudly and emphatically that that food was not to brought in. - Wirz would not have tried on that occasion- - Answer the question! Why didn't you say so? - Well, I wasn't asked. (audience laughing) (gavel thudding) - You weren't asked. Motion to dismiss Mr. Spencer's testimony as irrelevant in that it offers nothing more in the fact that Capt. Wirz was carrying out a direct order. - [Col. Chipman] Move denied! - Will the Judge Advocate offer a ground for denial? Is he saying that Capt. Wirz should've defied those direct orders of Gen. Winder's? - Will you deny it was an inhuman order? - Which he should've disobeyed? - [Gen. Wallace] Defense motion is denied. (gavel thudding) - Of course it's denied. It is now plain enough to know why the government has chosen to try Capt. Wirz on a conspiracy charge. By that charge, the accused may be convicted without any direct evidence against him. - Mr. Baker- - And if there is a conspiracy, it is one that is directed against Capt. Wirz. And I say now that the motives which bring Wirz to trial here dishonor the government of the United States and contradicting its own military code, the army will have that man despite the fact that he was doing his proper duty. - Are you through, Mr. Baker? - [Mr. Baker] I am through. - You have been in contempt since the beginning of that outburst. This Court will consider a formal charge against you. You are dismissed from this proceeding forthwith and you will immediately leave this room. (gavel thuds) - Let Capt. Wirz be without counsel so that this trial may be judged for what it is. (gavel thuds) - Guards, escort Mr. Baker from the room. - [Mr. Wirz] I, I appeal the Court, I will have no counsel. (laughing) No counsel and it makes no difference. - I respectfully request the Court... The Court has borne the provocative behavior of defense counsel with the utmost patience. I urge that Mr. Baker be allowed to purge himself of contempt if he so wishes. I pray that the magnanimity of the Court may extend itself so that not even in the wildest misrepresentation of this trial can it be said that that defendant was denied counsel of his choice. - (sighs) Mr. Baker. For the single reason that Mr. Wirz may have counsel of his choice, you may purge yourself of contempt if you so wish. You may do so by recanting those remarks impugning the integrity of the government and army of the United States by apologizing to this Court and by giving us your solemn oath such outbursts will not occur again. - I do so recant and apologize and give my oath that I will not hereafter impugn the fairness of this Court or the motives of the government and the army of the United States. - Thank you. The Judge Advocate... Colonel, are we through with this witness? - [Col. Chipman] Yes, sir, we are. - Witness may step down. Call your next witness, Colonel. - Yes, sir. (men chattering) On the specification that the defendant did keep in barbarously close confinement soldiers numbering at times 40,000 men, (somber drumming music) without adequate shelter from the rain and the heat of summer, and the cold of winter... Mr. Davidson, Capt. Wirz knew the dogs tore and killed prisoners of war, didn't he? - [Mr. Davidson] It was commonly known, yes, sir. - [Col. Chipman] Mr. Davidson, did you ever see a prisoner of war torn by dogs, I mean, an occasion when Mr. Wirz was present? (gavel thuds) - Col. Chipman, the Court does not wish to exclude pertinent testimony but we have heard a great number of former Andersonville prisoners testify. - Yes, yes we call only those witnesses we think necessary. - Necessary- - We cannot altogether the amount of time required for a thorough examination. - Yes, Colonel. Does the Judge Advocate hope, as he stated yesterday, to conclude this afternoon? - [Col. Chipman] Yes, we will make every effort to, sir. - Continue, Colonel. - Thank you. Mr. Davidson, the question is did you ever see a prisoner of war torn by dogs with Wirz present? Well, tell us about it, Mr. Davidson. - I saw that after tunneling out of the stockade with another prisoner. Dogs treed us. Guards ordered us down. The dogs tore my companion. - [Col. Chipman] And where was Wirz? - Rode up a minute after that pack of dogs had treed us, yelling, "Get those Yankee bastards." I beg your pardon. - [Col. Chipman] And what was Wirz doing while the dogs tore your companion? - Damning him to hell. His eyes starting out of his head like a fit was on him. - Can you think of another instance- - Colonel. (gavel thudding) The Court repeats it does not need to hear further evidence corroborating facts alleged many times over. - If the Court please (speaking faintly) will hear is Capt. Wirz's presence on the occasion when dogs not only tore a prisoner of war but actually killed him. - Killed him, yes. Will the government conclude this afternoon? - Yes, sir, we will conclude this afternoon. The question is, Mr. Davidson, of an instance when the dogs not only tracked down a prisoner of war but actually killed him and, of course, with Capt. Wirz present. Did you hear my question, Mr. Davidson? - [Mr. Davidson] Yes, sir. - Well? - I don't like to talk about that place, Colonel. - [Col. Chipman] State the circumstances. - Was this time a man from my prison squad escaped. But then we'd heard he'd been captured by the dogs. - [Col. Chipman] But you actually saw him being brought back to the stockade. - Yes, sir. First in the gates Capt. Wirz on that big gray he rode. Then two guards with this man in between 'em. They was holding him up letting him go once they was inside the gate. He fell down. His legs was tore, his throat laid open, flesh torn about the legs and his neck bloody. - Did he get up or did he just lie there? - Made as if to get up and then lay back. He didn't move after that. - And where was Wirz during all this? - Right there. - Right where? - Like I said he- - We will hear it again please, Mr. Davidson. - Like I said, he rode in, the man fell down. Capt. Wirz rode around looking down at him, reining in his horse which is skittering and rearing. That was a horse with a temper. And then he rode back out the gate. - [Col. Chipman] That'll be all. - Mr. Davidson we won't detain you long, sir. That first instance you described, when you were making your escape attempt, you say that Capt. Wirz yelled urging on those dogs that were tearing at your companion. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Davidson, at any time in your career have you ever yelled, "Get those rebel bastards"? - I guess so. - [Mr. Baker] What was it that Capt. Wirz yelled? - Get those Yank... But that was different. - [Mr. Baker] How different? - Well, he meant for those dogs to tear that man. I saw them do that. - [Mr. Baker] You were close enough to see that? - Yes, sir. - [Mr. Baker] Well, how close would you say, Mr. Davidson? - 10, 15 feet away maybe. No more than from here to there. - Well now, how can you say, Mr. Davidson, that those dogs, those ferocious dogs didn't attack you? Can you account for that? Can you think of any reason, Mr. Davidson? - I wouldn't know why, sir. - [Mr. Baker] Well, now since you admit that those ferocious dogs did not attack you, shall I understand that you were completely unhurt when you were brought back to the camp? - Oh no, sir. - [Mr. Baker] Well, you were bruised some as a result of rushing pell-mell through those swamps, weren't you? - Yes, sir. - [Mr. Baker] Bloodied a bit, too? - From all that running and stumbling against rocks? Yes, sir. - Yes, and from those bramble bushes and those whipping branches, and those dead cypress trees, some of them pointed as knives. - Yes, sir. - Well, that would bruise and bloody any man trying to beat a pursuit through a Georgia swamp, wouldn't it? - I guess so. - So in that second instance you spoke of when you saw that man brought back to the stockade and you saw those marks on him which you say were caused by dogs, couldn't they have been caused by his rushing headlong through that swamp as yours were? - That man was torn by dogs. - Now, now, Mr. Davidson, you didn't see him being torn by dogs, did you? - It was commonly known though. - Oh, many things are commonly known, sir. Could you identify the marks on that man as being indisputably caused by dogs? - He was bit by the dogs and he died. - Possibly. How long did you remain at that spot after that man, you don't know his name, do you, Mr. Davidson? - [Mr. Davidson] No, sir. - Well, how long did you remain there after that man fell down? - Three, five minutes. - [Mr. Baker] And did you have an occasion to look back that way later on? - Uh, sometime later, yes. - [Mr. Baker] Was he still lying there? - No. No, he's taken off to the dead house. - Or to the sick ward. Mr. Davidson, you can't really say for sure that that man died as a result of being mutilated by dogs and you can't identify him, isn't that correct? - Sir, please. I gotta go back home. - Capt. Wirz riding around that man without a word? That sounds mighty unfeeling. You wouldn't happen to know if Capt. Wirz notified the guard at the gate to have that man moved, would you? - I gotta go home, sir. - [Mr. Baker] No more questions. Thank you, Mr. Davidson. - Mr. Davidson, Capt. Wirz openly showed his contempt and hatred of those men brought back, didn't he? Those men torn and killed by those dogs. - I, I don't know. - You don't know? Capt. Wirz coldly sitting his horse indifferent to that man brought back to die? - I can't say for sure how he felt. - But those were marks of teeth and claws you identified on his body, weren't they? - I guess so. - Well, you were quite sure of that. At one time you also said that he died, that he lay there, the flies set on his face, he made no move to brush them off. - [Mr. Davidson] I... - And Capt. Wirz looking on, looking on that dying man. - I don't remember. - [Col. Chipman] Well, all I'm asking you to repeat is what you've already sworn to under oath, Mr. Davidson, that his attitude was monstrously cold and indifferent to those dying men. - Let me be, Colonel, please. - Mr. Davidson, I warn you- - I... I've got to forget that place. - Or has it been suggested that you forget that place? - Col. Chipman. I think the witness is through. Are you now ill, Mr. Davidson? - [Mr. Davidson] Yes, sir. I've got pains. - And you've told us about the incident as well as you can now recall it, is that correct? - [Mr. Davidson] Yes, sir. - How old are you, Mr. Davidson? - (sighs) 19, sir. - I believe you said you fought with the 2nd Vermont Cavalry. - 2nd Vermont Cavalry? Yes, sir. We turned their flanks many times. - Well, you may now go home, Mr. Davidson. And this Court wishes you god speed in recovering good health and in forgetting what you've endured in war and in prison. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. (bell ringing) Could be, could be those dogs didn't tear me for the same reason Daniel wasn't torn in the lion's den. There was many died in that place. Many died. I hear dogs baying at night. I hear voices cry out, "Help, help." No one to help. Many died. Many, many died. - Mister... I apologize to the witness. - Yes, sir. - (clears throat) Well, gentlemen, the weather continues hot and we've been at this trial longer than anticipated. So I will ascribe tempers to the heat. You may call your next witness, Colonel. - [Col. Chipman] Joseph Achuff to the stand. - Is Mr. Achuff called to testify on the specification that dogs attacked escaping prisoners? - [Col. Chipman] Yes, sir. - The Court refuses to hear (gavel thuds) further testimony on that specification. It's unnecessary. - If the Court please- - So call your next witness, Colonel. (gavel thuds) - [Col. Chipman] The final witness on the specification that the defendant caused the death of prisoners by the direct order, we call Jasper Culver to the stand. - [Guard] Jasper Culver. - Who next? - Hardy. - Do you solemnly swear that the evidence that you give to the Court- - Baker will roast Hardy and throw him back to me- - On the issue now depending between the Republic- - When I'm done with him. - And the prisoner at the bar- - He won't roast Gray. - Shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I won't put him on. - [Mr. Culver] I do. - His eyewitness evidence supports he murdered him. - Mr. Culver, what is your regiment, when were you captured and brought to Andersonville? - I was connected with the 15th Wisconsin Infantry and I was captured and brought to Andersonville in March, 1864. - Did you see a prisoner of war killed inside the stockade? - I did. - Who killed him? - The guard. - [Col. Chipman] Did the guard do so on his own or by direct order? - He was given a direct order to kill him. - [Col. Chipman] By whom? - By Capt. Wirz. - And where did this take place? - [Mr. Culver] At the dead-line. - And who did you see killed? - We called him Chickamauga because he'd lost a leg in that battle and because he'd lost his memory there so we called him by that name, Chickamauga. - And why did Chickamauga want to cross the dead-line? - He wished to lie down under a pine tree, he said, because a long time ago, not that he could remember where, he had laid down under a pine tree. "I can't remember nothing before Chickamauga," is what he told the guard. - [Col. Chipman] State the circumstances. When did this occur? - Was in early fall I believe. I remember the smell of burning leaves. - [Col. Chipman] Please continue. - I watched Chickamauga go toward the dead-line and I called to him to stop but he went on as if not hearing. At the line he shouted for the sentry to let him across but the sentry waved him back. Then Chickamauga began to move up and down the line hopping back and forth on his one leg and begging to be let out of the stockade just for 10 minutes. The guard let him stay on the line but he was nervous and telling Chickamauga to get back. And Chickamauga laughed. And then Chickamauga, he said for the guard to tell Capt. Wirz that he knew of a plot whereby all the men would escape and that he'd tell the Captain about that plot in exchange for being let out a few minutes. And with that the guard sent for the Captain to come and Wirz came. And when he saw Wirz, Chickamauga made the Captain promise to let him rest for a few minutes underneath that pine tree if he told him about that plot. And the Captain said he'd do that. Then Chickamauga said, "All right, I'll tell you "about that plot. "Here it is in a nutshell. "Well, you know Unckie Billy Sherman "in his white socks is marching through Georgia "and what he's gonna do is blast Andersonville open "from the outside and that's how the men will get free." (audience chuckling) And Wirz began to rave and he said to Chickamauga, "I'm gonna give you a pass to hell." And Chickamauga said, "You can't give me no pass to hell "on account of I'm in hell now." (audience laughing) And then Wirz turned to the guard and said, "Get that man back across the line or shoot him." And the guard said, "I can't shoot no cripple." And Wirz said, "If you don't obey me "I'm gonna have you court-martialed." And the next thing the guard shot Chickamauga and he fell over the dead-line, done for. (laughing) - [Col. Chipman] That'll be all. - Oh, Mr. Culver, I'm thinking of how accurately you told that story. I mean, you remember the details down to the exact words, back and forth. And that sense of detail makes you a most excellent witness, Mr. Culver. - Well, thank you, sir. - And one might add it is also a characteristic of a good soldier which I'm sure you were before Andersonville. - Before Andersonville? - When you were in the line. - In the line. Antietam Bridge and Chancellorsville and Stafford Courthouse. - You must remember those nighttime bivouacs around the fires, listening to those sentries. - Around the fires, hearing 'em calling through the dark, "All is well. "Post one to post two. "All is well." - Of course that outpost line, that was a line that no may dare cross on the pain of being shot by those sentries. - On pain of being shot by the sentries. "And who goes there?" is a cry. "Who goes there? "Who goes there?" - And, of course, you can tell us why such lines were set up by their commanding officers, Mr. Culver, as you remember it, sir, by the book. - By the book, yes, sir. And that is for the order and safety of the camp. - And inside the stockade at Andersonville, there were signs posted there warning men not to cross that dead-line? - [Mr. Culver] I recall some, yes, Counsel, there were. - Now, Mr. Culver, when... (laughs) I was just thinking of that story you told about Chickamauga. (both men laughing) Oh, I'm sure with the great interest that people have in anecdotes about the war today, well, you undoubtedly had an occasion to tell that story many times already, haven't you? - I have been requested to tell it a number of times. - Oh, I'll wager you could tell it a hundred times and it would come out exactly as you told it here today. - A thousand times, Counsel, it'd come out the same way. - (chuckles) And usually with great effect I'm sure. - With great effect, yes, sir. - But it would hardly be as effective if Capt. Wirz didn't come out the villain of the piece would it? - Well hardly. (both men laughing) You wish to make a fool of me, Counsel. I'm not lying. - No, you are not, Mr. Culver. Man can't help it if fables grow in his head, can he? - No, he... Fables, I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm looking for facts and I'm hunting for them through fairy tales of good and evil. Mr. Culver, you say you heard Capt. Wirz say, "Get that man back across the line or shoot him!" Didn't Capt. Wirz actually say, "For God sakes, get that man back across the line "or you will have to shoot him"? - It is frozen into my memory as I have said it. - When Chickamauga said, "I'm in hell now." Didn't Wirz say, "You and I both, "you and I both are in hell"? As indeed they were. - I have said it as I remember it. - As you need to remember it, Mr. Culver. No more questions, thank you. Move to dismiss on all counts under this specification since that dead-line was a proper military line required for the order and safety of that camp. - It was not a purely military line. Mr. Culver, come over here. Take a look at this map. Here, where the stream enters the west wall of that camp. What was the water like there? - It was somewhat fast-flowing, yes, sir. - But was it drinkable? - Somewhat drinkable, yes. That man there- - And here, here by the dead-line, what was the water like there? - [Mr. Culver] Not fit to drink, no, sir. - No, by that time it was filthy and clogged with waste matter, wasn't it, driving the men to do what? - We would try for a drink near the west wall. - Yes, and to get to that water they had to wade waist deep through the swamp, didn't they? - Waist-deep and further. - And once they succeeded in getting to that water, what did the guards do? - Opened fire on us, yes, sir. - Killing them? - Killing and wounding. - Killing and wounding men for a drink of water and Wirz knew that those men get shot down. And Counsel calls it a purely military line. Move to deny defense motion as to that dead-line in that it was clearly part of the cold, inhuman design of that camp. - Inhumane? - Yes! - Immoral? - Yes! - I can't listen- - Will the Judge Advocate openly and finally admit his belief that Capt. Wirz's duty was a moral and not a military choice? - A human choice! (gavel thudding) - This arguing over a irrelevant issue becomes intolerable. Parties are warned. Defense motion is denied. (gavel thuds) Now, would Advocate state the connection between the moral issue and the charge of conspiracy? - The Judge Advocate will not attempt to make that connection. (Gen. Wallace sighs) - Thank you, Mr. Culver, you may stand down. Well, if the Judge Advocate has concluded, we'll adjourn until tomorrow at which time the Defense will be ready? - We may wish to ask for further witnesses. - If so, they'll be witnesses bringing in new criminal evidence. I say new criminal evidence in the precise legal meaning of that term, bearing directly on the charge of conspiracy. I hope that's understood, Colonel. - [Col. Chipman] Yes, yes. - This Court's adjourned. (gavel clattering) (people chattering) - Tell me, Colonel, how does your role in this room differ from Wirz's in Andersonville? - You compare me to him? - You know in your heart you condemn him for carrying out the orders of his military superiors but this Court will have no part of that argument. And what then do you do but withdraw it? You obey as Wirz obeyed. - You compare me to him? - Oh, of course, you're governed by much purer motives. Let's forget about the fact that you're in a position to walk out of this case the envy of every young, struggling lawyer in the country. The successful prosecutor of the one war criminal to be hanged out of this war. You career is assured if you don't jeopardize it. Shall then the government's own counsel go out and preach disobedience to orders? (chuckles) How's it feel to be an instrument of policy and nothing more? - God damn you. - Get as angry as you wish but that's the truth of it. Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Ah. (panting) - Don't you see what he's trying to do? - I see. - He's trying to provoke you. - I know! (sighs) I shout at you (sighs), I shout at Davidson, only a boy, a sick boy. Well, where do we stand after days of witnesses on the stand? Sick, broken survivors of that place. We haven't proven criminal acts. What kind of a case did we bring in here? - Well, if you want a better one- - Close with Gray. - He saw Wirz commit murder. - You heard Gray. Do you believe him? - Let the Court decide. (bells ringing) Gray furnishes the name of the murdered man. His name and regiment. What's the difference in the end, Chipman? Wirz is doomed anyway. - The kind of case we bring in doesn't really matter then. - No. No, not really. - And if we believe that Wirz should have disobeyed to save those men and we're afraid to raise the issue... - Baker reached you. - But are we any better than he was at Andersonville or has Baker raised an issue that's been in this case from the beginning and one that we haven't wanted to face? - We don't need to face it. I'll say it again, Wirz is doomed. No matter how our case looks. Now, you can make it hard for yourself if you want to by turning it the wrong way but you're a soldier, Chipman, and you know how this army has to function if it functions at all. It has ways of dealing with irregulars. You seem to want to go a hard way. (Col. Chapman laughing) - I want to go a hard way. This blood-spattered country, skulls bleaching in the, under the sky. The dead of my own Iowa 2nd, names you wouldn't know. Did any of us wanna go a hard way? But we did. We did. As if we had any choice. As if I have any choice here. I asked for this case feeling hard against them. Hating them enough to wanna flog them through Wirz. You think I wanna shed that hatred? Understanding what Baker wants me to do to lock me in a quarrel with this government. I can't go around that. I hate that damn Southern cause. I still can't go around that issue. I'm partisan to my bones and I still can't go around what Baker says. I'd like to believe that I'm more of a man than Wirz was, that I would have disobeyed to save those men. But am I more of a man than he was? Either I press the Court to consider the issue of Wirz's moral responsibility to disobey, or I'm no better in my mind than he was. And I can't go around that. - How will you raise your moral issue? - I don't know. (chuckles) Get Baker to put Wirz on the stand. - Which he won't do. Put Gray on. You don't have to like him. Put Gray on the stand, nail this case down with the clearest statement of murder and you have your man even if it isn't in your way. The government has a point to make, too, you know. It struggles to pull together a divided country. Now, isn't that a worthy, an important thing? (laughs) At least as important as the purity of your soul. - Hosmer. Hosmer. There are larger issues than a man's own convictions, aren't there? - Sometimes. You make me feel old. (somber music) - At ease. (gavel thudding) This military court is now in session. What is the pleasure of the Judge Advocate? - If the Court please, on the specification that the defendant committed murder by his own hand we call to the stand Sgt. James S. Gray. - [Guard] Sgt. James S. Gray. - If the Court please, we do not see that name listed here. - [Col. Chipman] Sgt. Gray's name was not listed because it was uncertain that his release from duty to be arranged in time. He's attached to Gen. Thomas's headquarters in Nashville. - [Mr. Baker] No objection. - Witness may be sworn in. - Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give to the Court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - Yes, sir. - Sgt. Gray, what is your regiment? - 7th Illinois Calvary, Company B, sir. - How long have you been in the service? - My last term, two years, one month. - How long were you in Andersonville Prison? - I was taken to Andersonville 10th of June, 1864. I remained there until November. - Do you know anything about the defendant Wirz having killed a man there at any time? - Yes, sir. He shot a young fella named William Stewart, private belonging to the 9th Minnesota Infantry. - [Col. Chipman] State the circumstances. - Stewart and I went outside the stockade with a dead body. - [Col. Chipman] Explain how you could get out. - The regulations were that whenever a man died prisoners could be detailed to take the dead body out past the gate to the dead house. - [Col. Chipman] Continue. - Well, sir, I begged for a chance to move that dead body and I was picked along with Stewart to take it out. We went up to the main gate with the body and they passed us through with a guard. It was my determination, I don't know whether it was Stewart's or not, but it was my determination to try to make an escape again. We went toward the dead house, not to put the body in the dead house, because in that house they were piled like cordwood, full to the top, and a line of dead bodies extended from it for about 50 yards. Wirz rode up and dismounted, asked us what we were doing out there. Stewart replied we'd brought out a dead body to be placed in the dead house. Wirz said it was a lie. We were out there trying to make our escape. Stewart said it was not so. We were out there for the purpose stated. Wirz said, "If you say that again "I'll blow your brains out." Stewart repeated what he said before. Wirz struck him down, stopped him, drew his revolver, shot him dead. - Sergeant, is that the man? - Yes, sir. - Look close, Sergeant. Make sure. I give you the chance to take back that lie before the great god judges you. - You knocked him down, you shot him dead. - [Col. Chipman] That'll be all. - We would like a moment to confer with the defendant. We have no preparation for this witness. - [Man] What are you thinking? - Quick, who is Gray? - (chuckles) It is no use. - Who is Gray? - I don't know. - What about William Stewart? - There was no Stewart. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes, yes, I am sure. - Sergeant, would you describe once again this so-called Stewart's death? - [Sgt. Gray] Wirz rode up, asked us by what authority we were out there. Stewart replied we were out there by proper authority. - So Capt. Wirz knocked him down and then shot him simply because he said he was out there by proper authority? - Whether he shot Stewart because he said that or because he was a Yankee I don't know. I don't know why he shot Stewart but that's all Stewart said to him. - There were some guards about at time when this so-called murder occurred, were there not? - [Sgt. Gray] I recall some. - Did you speak to them after Stewart was killed? - I never spoke to Johnny Reb if I didn't have to. - How well did you know Stewart? - [Sgt. Gray] We were on the same prison squad. - And under what circumstance did he oblige you with his name and his regiment? - [Sgt. Gray] I don't recall exactly. - Well then, describe this William Stewart. - All looked alike there. Thinned out, not to be recognized by their own mothers. - So you can't describe him. Yet you talked with him, you know his name and his regiment but you can't describe him. What'd he do, hide his face when he talked with you? Oh, I know, thinned out and not to be recognized even by their own mothers. Well then, can you refer to some third person who might be able to identify this William Stewart? - [Sgt. Gray] No. - No? What does that answer mean, "No"? There were 19 men in that prison squad with you and Stewart. Then other men, at least one must've known he was with the 9th Minnesota and could identify him. - Counsel, he just happened to mention his name and regiment to me. - However fortunately for the prosecution which until now has lacked for a clear criminal instance it has dredged you up as the single witness to a murder of a man having at least a name. Sergeant, do you believe in the afterlife? And do you believe that a man's sins, including the sin of lying, will there be punished? - I believe there is such a thing as punishment after death. - Have you ever been arrested for a criminal offense? - No, sir. - I take it you like the army, Sergeant, seeing as you have reenlisted. - [Sgt. Gray] I would say that. - After all, the army feeds you, makes you comfortable, and judging from your sergeant's stripes, you are considered by your military superiors to be a good soldier, one who knows what he is supposed to do without it being explained to him in so many words. - A man gets to know what's expected of him. - And if you felt, even if you weren't told, what was expected of you, you'd carry that out, wouldn't you? - [Sgt. Gray] Certainly. - And if you felt, even if you weren't told, what the army's real concern was in some situation, and if you understood that to mean that you were supposed to lie, you would lie. (gavel thudding) - Mr. Baker, you finish your question along that line, you'll be in contempt. - Withdrawn. Sergeant, what did you do before entering the army? - I farmed some, ran dogs. - [Mr. Baker] Ran dogs? - For hunting and so forth. - Oh, where'd you do that work? - [Sgt. Gray] Illinois, Indiana, Virginia. - Virginia? Virginia. For what purpose did you run your dog pack in Virginia? Was it by any chance to bring back runaway slaves? - Yes, sir. - I take it it was more profitable to track down runaway slaves in Virginia than it was to go hunting deer in Indiana. - Well, being a Negro was valuable property that had to be brought back alive. - Tell me, Sergeant, did that valuable property ever make human sounds when you caught it? Did it ever beg you to let it go find freedom? - I don't remember. - Human feelings must be put aside sometimes, mustn't they? And the truth must be put aside sometimes, too. And when you say you saw Capt. Wirz shoot a man named Stewart at Andersonville, you were lying, weren't you? - I saw that happen as I have described it. - That'll be all, Sergeant. (heels thudding) - Were you lying when you said you saw Wirz kill a man named Stewart? - I saw that happen as I have described it. - Did you see Wirz kill a man named Stewart or did you hear something about it? - I saw that happen as I have described it, sir. - That'll be all. - [Gen. Wallace] Witness may step down. Has the Judge Advocate finally concluded his case? - [Col. Chipman] Yes, sir. - And is the Defense ready? - Yes, sir. Since Defense regards the instance of murder alleged against the defendant as the single charge worth refuting- (gavel thuds) - Baker! The Court is not interested in your judgment of the charges. (gavel clattering) - We shall waive the entire list of our witnesses and in their place call to the stand one witness. (audience chattering) - [Gen. Wallace] One witness? - [Mr. Baker] Questioning will only take a few minutes and it will constitute the entire defense case. - Yes, well who is the witness? - He's in the room. Dr. Ford, physician in charge at the Old Capitol Jail where the defendant has been lodged since the trial began. - [Gen. Wallace] Let Dr. Ford take the stand. (people chattering) - [Man] But are you sure, Mr. Baker, this our one case. - Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give to this Court on the issue now depending between the Republic and the prisoner at the bar, shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? - [Dr. Ford] I do. - Dr. Ford, you have for some time past now been in the habit of seeing the defendant. - Yes, sir, since June, I believe. Ever since his imprisonment he's been under my care when sick. - [Mr. Baker] And have you during that time examined the defendant's right arm and have you examined him today? - Yes, sir. - What do you find the condition to be of his right arm? - It's swollen and inflamed, ulcerated in three places, has the appearance of having been broken. - [Mr. Baker] And the fingers of his right hand? - Two fingers, the little finger and the next, are slightly contracted. The contraction is due to injury of the nerve leading down to the fingers. - And have you examined the defendant's left shoulder? - Yes, sir. A portion of it is dead. There's a very large scar on the left shoulder. A portion of the deltoid muscle is entirely gone. I suppose from his war wound. It's just been carried away. Only the front part of the muscle remain. - [Mr. Baker] And, Doctor, how would that affect the strength in that arm? - Well, he might be able to strike out with the forearm from the elbow but he could not elevate the whole arm. - Now, as to his right arm, would he be capable of pushing or knocking a man down? - [Dr. Ford] No, I should think he'd be incapable of doing so with either arm without doing himself great injury. - Would he be capable using with any force a heavy or a light instrument, would he be capable of pulling the trigger let alone suffering the recoil of a heavy revolver? - [Dr. Ford] No, not likely. - And as to his condition a year ago in 1864? - I've spoken with Dr. Biggs who was at Andersonville and who examined Mr. Wirz there at the defendant's request. And he agrees with my opinion that this condition was no better in 1864 than it is today. - So that he could not have knocked down this so-called William Stewart. - I don't see how. - He could not have pulled the trigger. - Well, as I've said- - He could not have killed him. The defense rests, thank you. (people chattering) - Colonel, Col. Chipman? Will the Judge Advocate cross-examine? - Dr. Ford... Dr. Ford has testified as to Mr. Wirz's medical condition as he sees it and we're not here to dispute medical facts. There's no cross-examination, but- - [Gen. Wallace] Thank you, Dr. Ford. - What is it? Is it all finished? But I have not had the chance- - We will convene the day after tomorrow to hear Government and Defense summations. - If it please the Court, we would like to ask for a continuance. - Does the Judge Advocate wish to bring forward new evidence? - It's possible. We'd like to ask for a continuance until tomorrow morning. It's possible that there is something more pertinent to this trial- - Well, perhaps the Defense would welcome new evidence. - Absolutely, particularly on the charge of violent murder attributed to a man who can't even raise his arms. - Unless the Government contemplates other witnesses, we must consider that the presentation of evidence is finished. (gavel clattering) - If it please the Court, we do not feel that the situation at Andersonville has been sufficiently explored. That is why we ask for a continuance. If there is more to be said, more to be discovered about what took place there. - I agree, yes! For once I agree with the Judge Advocate. - Does the defendant wish to take the stand on his own behalf? - [Mr. Wirz] What? - No, what is that? The defendant will not take the stand. - He's not legally bound to do so but he may wish to make his position clearer. More clear- - Now what is that? The Judge Advocate- (men shouting) He addresses the witness over the head of his counsel. - [Col. Chipman] To take the stand. - [Mr. Wirz] That I might make my position clearer. - You cannot speak, Mr. Wirz, unless you take the stand. The Judge Advocate is asking if you want to take the stand. You have a right to do so but you can't be compelled to do so. You have that right. Though we suggest you listen to counsel. (men chattering) - Are you out of your mind? - I don't understand what's come over you. - Gildred, listen. - This legal game has been played back and forth and I am to die without a word to say for myself. I must explain- - But listen! The evidence against you that they've got is tainted from the start to the finish and they know that. Let them bring in their verdict of guilty but then it must go to the president who may pardon as he values the reputation of the government and that is your single chance. - And I say no chance, no chance. - [Mr. Schade] Wirz, listen to Baker. - [Mr. Baker] You will not take that stand. - I was a man like other men. I wish to show that. - But you will face Chipman alone and you will be alone. - Do you understand that, alone? - Yes, alone, as I've been alone. Neither you nor anyone here has been concerned with me as a man. And now I might wish to speak since the Judge Advocate wishes me to take the stand. - Mr. Wirz, the Judge Advocate cannot influence you to do that. He's not your counsel. - Well, of course, he is not. He is my worst enemy. Oh, I know that he wishes to destroy me. (chuckles) Take the stand on my own behalf, eh, Colonel? - On your own behalf. - Are you dispensing with counsel, Capt. Wirz? - You may take the stand and speak for yourself, Mr. Wirz, but afterwards, I warn you, I will try to search you out to the bottom of your soul. - Ha, you think you can do that? - [Col. Chipman] I can try. - [Gen. Wallace] Will the defendant state whether or not he wishes to take the stand? - [Mr. Wirz] General (laughing). Did you hear that? My worst enemy, what does he say? He will search me out to the bottom of my soul. - Capt. Wirz, Capt. Wirz! (Capt. Wirz grunts) Do you think that Chipman is here to save you? - Well, I am to die. I must take the stand. I have been made a monster in the eyes of my children. I die with that mark on me if I do not speak out and I will not have it that way. I will give them my words so that they can say their father was a man like other men. You understand, you will examine but then I will fight him. - And if you take that stand how do I stop you from saying more than you should? - But don't you understand, Baker, I must fight him, I must fight him. - The defendant will take the stand on his own behalf. - Mr. Baker, he understands that he is not required to do so. - Oh, he understands and he wishes to do so. - (sighs) Very well, Mr. Wirz, you may take the stand. (Capt. Wirz coughing and sniffling) - Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give to the Court in the issue now depending between the Republic and the prisoner at the bar shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? - I do. (grunting and coughing) - Capt. Wirz, you are a naturalized citizen of the United States, is that correct? - Yes, sir. - When and where were you born? - I was born in Zurich, Switzerland, in the year 1822. - And in what year did you arrive in the United States? - In 1849. - Would you state briefly your activities prior to the outbreak of the war? - Yes, I worked at first in the mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and not doing well there, moved with my family to various parts of the United States. I resided for a while in Louisiana and lived in Louisville, Kentucky, when the war broke out. - Would you now state your war record prior to your assignment as superintendent of the Andersonville Prison camp? - I enlisted in the services of the Confederacy as a private and was soon commissioned as a lieutenant having had previous military training abroad. After being wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines, I was offered that assignment of superintendent by Gen. Winder. - [Mr. Baker] And over what period of time did you serve in that assignment? - From January 1864 until February of this year. - Capt. Wirz, during that time, were you given any special or secret instructions as how to run that camp? - [Mr. Wirz] No, sir. - I refer specifically, sir, to the instructions of the care of the prisoners. - No, sir, no special instructions beyond the prescribed regulations for the care of prisoners of war and any statement to the contrary is- - [Mr. Baker] Capt. Wirz. The food supplies at first furnished you sufficient for those prisoners? - Yes, at first I received ample supplies to furnish for each and every enemy prisoner, a ration which was the same ration issued to Confederate soldiers as is the custom. It included bacon, fresh baked bread daily. If not bacon there was beef and those men did not starve. But later, it became- - Captain, Captain, would you now state the circumstances under which that situation changed? - Yes, it began to change for the worse around March when we began to receive prisoners by the thousands but not sufficiently an increase in the rations. So naturally, I had to more and more cut down that ration. And I wrote to Gen. Winder about that. - [Mr. Baker] Yes, when, Captain, when did you write to Gen. Winder? - Sometime in May 1864. - I have here a letter written by Capt. Wirz to Gen. Winder dated May 26th, 1864. - [Mr. Schade] Presented to the Court. - [Clerk] Exhibit nine for the Defense. - [Mr. Schade] Letter of May 26th, 1864, entered as evidence for the Defense. - Captain, would you now tell us about that letter? - I wrote to Gen. Winder complaining about the lack of food and requested additional supplies. - [Mr. Baker] And, Captain, did Gen. Winder reply to that letter? - He did so on one of his visits to the camp. He said we were taking care of the prisoners just as well as the enemy took care of our men in their hands. He said that our men were not well-treated, especially at the camp in Elmira, New York, where they were dying like flies. He was in a temper. He made it clear that closed the subject. And as an inferior officer I felt I could not pursue the matter further. But I did what it was in my power to do there as about the drummer boys. - Yes, Captain, we will get to that in a moment. Would you now tell the Court the origin of the dead-line? - Yes, as to the dead-line, mmm. In the conversation I said to Gen. Winder that the prisoners were getting desperate because of the lack of food and the guards consequently nervous fearing a rush on the walls and there was bound to be trouble. I asked for more guards to quiet the prisoners down with a show of strength but he said that the men could not be spared. But still it was my responsibility they should not escape, don't you see? So I suggested that inner line and Gen. Winder approved that line. But that does not mean that I did not consider those men. As I started to say before about the drummer boys. - Very well, very well. Tell the Court about those drummer boys. - There were 60 or 70 boys in the camp, drummer boys, little bits of boys. And I felt bad that those boys should suffer there having children of my own. So I asked them if they would take an oath not to try to escape and they did. (chuckles) And they were allowed on parole outside the gate and they lived outside the camp. I assigned them to pick blackberries to furnish additional food for the camp but that did not work out. (chuckles) Being boys, they ate what they picked themselves. (laughs) And that was not all that I did. - Captain, would you now tell us about Father Whelan? - What, yes. I allowed all religious people of any denomination to enter that camp. And Father Whelan of the Roman Catholic Church came there several times bringing fresh bread there. He was allowed to do that. And he distributed it to all the prisoners, black and white. All of these people of any denomination were permitted to enter that camp and bring comfort to the prisoners, all, all. I believe that religion, oh, that religion is one of the- - Yes, Captain, Captain. Would you now tell us about the women who tried to bring food to that camp? - Yes, yes, at first Gen. Winder graciously consented to let that food be brought in. But when the women were about to do that, he received some bad war news, some report that Sheridan was burning farmhouses and crops in the Shenandoah Valley. And he flew into a rage and he said that the food could not be brought in. And as an inferior there I could hardly override his orders. Huh, eh? And that is how it was, yes. In general, that place was entirely on my head. - [Mr. Baker] And did you try to get relieved, Captain? - I have not finished. As I was saying then, in general, that place was entirely on my head. I had the responsibility to keep order and to keep those men from escaping. And they kept trying and it was difficult to keep order since the men kept trying. Naturally, they had that right to try and I had my duty which was to prevent them. - But you did try to get relieved of that assignment, did you not, Captain? - Yes, I wrote to Gen. Winder asking to be assigned to another post but he informed me that I could not be relieved and simply I had there to stay. And so it kept being on my head. - I have here a letter written by the defendant to Gen. Winder dated May 19th, 1864, in which he requests to be relieved of his assignment, of his post. - Exhibit for the Defense. - [Gen. Wallace] It may be entered. - [Clerk] Exhibit 10 for the Defense. - [Mr. Schade] Letter of May 19th, 1864, offered for the Defense. - Now, Capt. Wirz, did you strike down or kill a man called William Stewart? - (scoffs) There was no William Stewart and that is a lie. (gavel thudding) There was no William Stewart. - Did you at any time, shoot down or kill a prisoner of war? - No, sir, I never did that. I could not physically do that. - And when you were arrested, at the conclusion of those hostilities, were you making an attempt to escape? - (chuckles) No, sir. I had no reason to do that. I was standing outside the stockade with my family and having heard of the general pardon (chuckles), was on my way back to Louisville when a major of Gen. Merritt's forces entered to tell me that I was under arrest. I was taken away and held prisoner and I soon understood the awful charge against me and that my fate was to hang. - [Mr. Baker] That will be all, thank you. - Am I not to be asked my conception of my duty? - [Mr. Baker] That will be all, Captain. - I wish to explain how I understand the military rules. - [Mr. Baker] Very well. Explain your understanding of the military code. - That one does as he is ordered, that he keeps his feelings to himself. That he does not play the heroic game that some people who are not in his position think he could play. That he obeys. That he does not concern himself with the policies of his superiors but obeys. That he does his assigned job and obeys. That when the order to charge is given, he obeys. That when ordered to keep prisoners, he obeys. And if in so doing he must die, then he dies. - [Mr. Baker] Your witness, Colonel. - Mr. Wirz, you've explained your sense of duty very clearly. When an officer is ordered to keep prisoners, he obeys. - Yes, sir. - Meaning he must keep them from escaping. - That is one of the things, yes. - Meaning he must keep them alive? - Insofar as it is within his power. - Which did you consider more important, keeping them alive or keeping them from escaping? - According to the customs of war, to keep them alive, as it was within my power, and to prevent them from escaping. - One duty, more nor less important in your mind? - Both equal. - You say you never at any time killed a prisoner of war. - It has been demonstrated that I could not. - I ask you, sir, directly, did you or did you not? - No, sir, I never did that. - In your letter of May, 26th, 1864, in which you tell Gen. Winder of your increasing duties at Andersonville, I note you also asked him to consider you for a promotion in rank from captain to major. What were you concerned with when you wrote that letter, the promotion or the overcrowding? - It is nothing wrong in the same letter to request that promotion. - And in your letter requesting the transfer, you make a point of your illness as the reason. - Yes, to make it indirect otherwise Gen. Winder might not have liked that transfer request. - All the same, you do request medical attention, do you not? - Yes, I had in mind at the same time to get away from that assignment. - You say what happened at Andersonville was beyond your power to avert? - Yes, sir. - In the course of performing your duties, you would make an inspection of the stockade, from time to time, I imagine, from the walls where the guards stood. You could look down into that... How would you describe it, sir? - It has been described. - As a sort of hell? - Oh, indescribable, sir, indescribable. I hope you will remember, Colonel, hearing me say that I could not bear the sight of those young boy prisoners in there and 60 or 70 of them I sent them out to pick blackberries. - [Col. Chipman] Yes, yes, that's in your favor. - Thank you, sir. - It's interesting to note that you keep referring to that act as though there's so much else you dare not remember. - You twist things, sir. I let Father Whelan bring bread. - You would go to your duties every morning from your home, hmm? - [Mr. Wirz] Yes, sir. - And you were concerned with raising your children in the normal fashion, teaching them the common virtues, did you not? - [Mr. Wirz] Particularly in a religious way, yes. - You saw nothing strange in leaving your family and your grace at meals and going to your job overseeing the dying of men? - Objection. - Withdrawn. You've said that keeping those men alive was of equal importance in your mind with keeping them from escaping. - [Mr. Wirz] Yes, sir. - The food was wormy and rotten. Did you think of sending foragers out to commandeer supplies from the Georgia farmers? - It would have been illegal for me to do so. - [Col. Chipman] Signed vouchers? - I was not authorized. - Paid for by the Confederacy? - [Mr. Wirz] Not authorized, sir. - [Col. Chipman] Could have sent out squads of prisoners to collect firewood. - Who would escape. - [Col. Chipman] Under guard. - There were not enough guards. - Enlarge the stockade? - [Col. Chipman] The size was prescribed- - Let those prisoners, among whom were carpenters, masons, mechanics of all types, build shelters that would have kept those men alive. - [Mr. Wirz] As I have said, not authorized. - But those measures would've saved lives. - I do not know how many. - Or was it just one? Would you say just one, single human life is precious, Mr. Wirz? - I do not follow. It would have been illegal for me to do the things you say! - But morally right. - [Mr. Baker] Objection. - Yes, the Court must agree. The Judge Advocate's questioning does not connect with the charge of conspiracy. - If the Court please, if I may explore this issue one step further before deciding the connection cannot be made. - You may explore it, Colonel, one step further. - You're a religious man, Mr. Wirz. - [Mr. Wirz] As I have said, I know how important religion is. I allowed all ministers of any denomination. - Professing religion as you do, will you agree that the promptings of conscience, moral considerations are primary to all men? - Of course I do. I observe that ideal like most men when I can. - When you can. And you could not observe moral considerations at Andersonville. - [Mr. Wirz] That situation was Gen. Winder's responsibility not mine. - This was Gen. Winder's responsibility because he was your military superior? - Yes, sir. - How far over you did you deem his authority to extend? - To all circumstances considering that was a military war situation. - To all circumstances, are you certain of that? - I am absolutely certain. And had Gen. Winder in this military war situation given you a direct order to slaughter one of your own children without an explanation would you have done it? - (laughing) It is ridiculous. - Would you have done it? - It is ridiculous. That was against the law. - Would you have done it? Why not? - I would have been an insane order. - Yes, insane or inhuman or immoral. And a man does, indeed, therefore, in his heart make some inner judgment as to the orders he obeys. - Colonel. (gavel thudding) The Judge Advocate will hold. This Court has stated more than once it is not disposed to consider the moral issue relating to soldierly conduct. (sighs) It has indicated to the Judge Advocate that we are on extremely delicate ground at any time that we enter into the circumstances under which officers may disobey their military superiors. However, the Judge Advocate apparently now feels he must enter that area. He will furnish some legal basis to this Court or he will withdraw this line of questioning. - If the Court please, I will endeavor to connect- - The Judge Advocate must furnish a legal basis. - But the Judge Advocate respectfully urges- - This Court will hear a basis for permitting this line of inquiry- - If the Court please. Military courts judging war crimes are governed by both the criminal code and a broader, more general code of universal international law. In most cases that come before them, they will judge the specific acts in which the nature and the degree of offense is determinable without great difficulty. But on rare occasions, cases occur demanding from the court a more searching inquiry. And should the court allow that broader inquiry, it becomes more than just court of reckon on a particular case. It becomes a supreme tribunal willing to peer into the very heart of human conduct. The Judge Advocate respectfully urges that the Court does not in advance limit or narrowly define the basis of questioning. Should the Court insist on such a basis, we are through with the witness. - Well, does the Judge Advocate offer this Court alternatives? - [Col. Chipman] Oh no, sir, we did not mean to imply that. - No, you know, we are very flattered to think that we may take on the mantle of a supreme tribunal. However, it is still a military court. - [Col. Chipman] If the Court pleases- - No, Colonel, I'm not through. - Now, the Court grants that it may be philosophically true that men have the human right to judge the commands of their military superiors. But, Colonel, in practice, one does so at his peril. - At his peril, yes, sir. - And we would want that the peril of that line of questioning that it be clearly understood, most clearly. Now we have a question for the Judge Advocate which he may or may not answer since he, of course, is not on trial here. The question is, what is it an honest man fights for when he takes up arms for his country? Is it the state or the moral principle inherent in that state? And if the state and the principle are not one, is he bound not to fight for that state and, indeed, to fight against it? Now, the Judge Advocate needn't answer. We'll make the question more particulate. If, at the outbreak of the war, the government of the so-called Confederacy had stood on the moral principle of freedom for the black man and the government of the United States had stood for slavery, would a man have been bound on moral grounds to follow the dictates of conscience even, even if it had led him up to the point of taking up arms against the government of the United States? - It's inconceivable to- - That's not the question here. - Well, in such a situation you could not possibly- - And that is not the question. - He would be bound to follow the dictates of his own conscience. - Colonel, even to the point of taking up arms against the government of the United States? - Yes, sir. (Gen. Wallace sighs) - Well, the Colonel understands, of course, that a man must be prepared to pay the penalties involved for violating the, well, let us say the code of the group to which he belongs. Now, in other societies that has meant death. In our society, it can merely mean depravation of status or contempt of his fellows, exile in the midst of his countrymen. (sighs) Well, I take it the Colonel understands my meaning. - He understands what the Court is saying. - And you still... He still feels that he must enter this most dangerous area? - General, I do not enter on my own free will. I enter because I am forced to it by the very nature of this case. We have lately emerged from a terrible and bloody war and this war has spawned a very curious and sinister crime. Men in the thousands, 14,000 men have been sent to their death, not by bullets on the battlefield, but in a subtle, hidden, furtive fashion. We have through the course of this trial examined, as it were, the outward appearances of hell. The walls, the stockade, the swamps, the dogs, the terrible heat, the freezing cold, and we have not gotten to the heart of it. We are now faced with a necessity of exploring further into, I'll say it again, hell. I put it to the Court that we owe to those 14,000 men who died, to those who mourn them, something so true as to put us head and shoulders above politics, above sectionalism, above the bitterness in our own heart. I admit to entering this room with that bitterness in myself. I admit to that mood of vengeance. I wish... I wish now to go beyond that if I can. As we say, life is precious. And, as we cling to our humanity by our fingernails in this world, by our fingernails, let us have a human victory in this room. - Colonel, the Court is not unmoved. (clears throat) The Judge Advocate feels, considers, he feels it is primary to the presentation of his case the moral issue, the disobedience to a superior officer? - [Col. Chipman] Yes, sir. (sighing) - You may continue. Judge Advocate may continue. - The Judge Advocate may continue? - [Gen. Wallace] Yes! - Defense counsel is amazed that this Court does not now recognize the fact that there is no legal case here! To try to connect normal obedience to orders with willful conspiracy is impossible. And no fine-sounding statements of universal law or supreme tribunal can break the unbridgeable! And the Court knows that the Judge Advocate cannot possibly make that connection. Yet the Court allows the Judge Advocate to proceed when it should for with dismiss the defendant! - Are you, Mr. Baker, ordering the Court to do that? - No, but he submits that there is no legal case here. - The Judge Advocate may continue! (fist thudding) And this Court will decide when he will conclude that question when nothing more can be gained by it! Is that clear? (glass thuds) - Mr. Wirz. Mr. Wirz, we have said that a man does make an inner judgment as to the orders he obeys which implies that if those orders offend his humanity deeply enough, he may disobey them. Gen. Winder's authority over you was not absolute. The question is why did you obey? - (sighs) Am I required to answer? I did not think of my assignment at Andersonville in that way. I do not understand what happens here, huh? I thought only in the normal way to obey him since he was my military superior. - But not your moral superior, sir. No man has authority over the soul of another. As we are men, we own our own souls. And as we own them, we are equal as men, sir, the generals, the privates, the professor, the hod-carrier. We're equal as men, sir. And every man alive being a man knows that as you in your heart knew that. And as this situation- - But that is not what- - Had become an immoral, grossly immoral situation, and as Gen. Winder was not your moral superior, you did not have to obey him. The question, therefore, remains, why did you obey him? - [Gen. Wallace] Mr. Wirz, the Court would like to hear the answer. - I will say it clearly. I would most certainly have been court-martialed. And if my superiors wished, considering that was a time of war and that war had come to a desperate, bitter stage in which the word traitor could be sounded in a moment, I might have been executed. - But it might, at least, have been for a reason. You might have saved 14,000 men. Were you afraid, sir? - I, a soldier, afraid? - Then the question still is why did you obey? - Just I have said. Huh, what a heroic thing do you demand I should have done at Andersonville? I, an ordinary man, like most men- - Now, Mr. Wirz, we, who are born into the human race, are elected to an extraordinary role in the scheme of things. We're endowed with reason, Mr. Wirz, and therefore personally responsible for our acts. A man may give to officials over him many things but not his soul, sir, not what we call his immortal soul. And, therefore, the question still is why did you obey? - Why? As I have said, as I say for the last time, that was to me a military situation. - But this was not a military situation. Those helpless, unarmed men were not the enemy. No matter what Winder said, this was no longer a question of North and South, a question of war, but a question of human beings. Chandler saw that. The women who tried to bring that food to the starving men, they saw that! Where was your conscience then? - Well- - In Gen. Winder's pocket along with his keys, his tobacco, and his money, and worth no more than any of those things? - You speak high, Colonel, high! Ask them here in this room if they can say in their hearts they would have done different if they had been in my place. Ask them! You are all the victors here and you make up a morality for the losers. - [Col. Chipman] Yes, the victors make the morality for the losers cannot. - And I spit on that morality, I spit on it. And I say ask them in this room if they would have done different. Huh, ask them! - And if they cannot, then we must shudder for the world we live in for the prospect before us then is a world of Andersonvilles, of jailers concerned only with executing the commands of the masters, they're freed of their conscience, concerned only with the masters to whom they have lost their souls. Might not the jailer commit murder then? - I did not commit murder. - [Col. Chipman] You did not kill William Stewart? - There was no William Stewart. - You were never in a fury with those men, a fury so great as to overcome the weakness in your arms? - [Mr. Wirz] It is as the doctor said. - To whom do you dare say that? You and I have been on the battlefield. We've seen men with their bowels in their hands and with their legs broke and still move forward. You moved those dead arms. - No. - You raised them. Yes! Yes, you did. You were in a fury when you rode out with those men. And when you caught them, you raised those two dead arms. - No! - Then how did you rein that hard-mouth horse to the left and how to the right and how keep his head down when he reared if not with those two- (Mr. Wirz screaming) (people chattering) (groans) - Possibly, I raised my arms sometimes, yes. But I did not kill any William Stewart because there was no William Stewart, so help me God! - William, leave William Stewart aside. But you had to obey those orders that were killing men, didn't you? - I had to obey. - Even though you knew that to obey was to kill them and to disobey was to save them? - Even though. Simply I could not disobey. (huffs) I did my duty as I saw it. I have made that clear. And you badger me. With however way I will explain it, it will not do for you. And you'll badger me, you badger. You badger me. (panting) I have made it clear that I had to keep order there, hmm? To keep a record monthly of the number of prisoners including those escaping to report that to Gen. Winder and for the War Department and you badger me! (sniffles) It has been made clear and you will not let go! To prevent them from escaping, hmm? To keep a record in writing of the attempted escapes, that was my responsibility. Isn't that clear, huh? (chuckles) Even though I have not enough men but that does not excuse me. Though I found that job overwhelming, isn't that clear? And you badger me! It, it was overwhelming. (crying) (panting) And I had to find ways and means to block those escape attempts. That was my duty. It was solely on my head. And so then I preventing, they trying, I preventing, they trying. And no move to stop them completely successful, nothing. Nothing could stop them. (pants) And the responsibility solely mine. (panting) The dead-line, huh? No, that could not prevent them. (chuckles) Cannon mounted on the walls, it could not prevent them. Kept trying. Tunneling under the walls, digging, burrowing, burrowing in the night, burrowing. Crushed by the weight of the wall timbers when they made the mistake to tunnel directly under those logs. And the others continuing, continuing. Tracked down by the dogs, trying again. And I have to anticipate. Finding their tunnels, learning their tricks. They trying, I preventing. They trying, I preventing. They bribing the guards with greenbacks. (sniffles) (grunting) Blackening their faces to look like niggers to pack up the dead bodies out of the stockade. And I tried to block those moves but nothing prevails them to try, the burrowing. Day and night I am awake. I did not need to see them to know what they are doing. Burrowing in the night, digging, digging in the hopeless effort to escape. Digging, crawling like rats. - Like rats. And rats may die and one may have no compunction about rats. - Yes. Oh, no, ah, no. I meant rat so to speak. You are playing a cheap lawyer's trick on me. - Very well, a cheap lawyer's trick. So they were not rats to you. But they were no longer men to you. In your mind you had canceled them out as men, made them less than men. Then they might die. And one need not suffer over that, need he? Why, why did you try to commit suicide in your cell? Was it because you feel nothing? Was it because you feel nothing as a human being and cannot endure yourself feeling nothing? You speak too much of your children. Is it because you've already asked them in your mind, "Should I have done my duty?" (Mr. Wirz grunts) "Or should have I given the man a drink of water?" And you have already heard their answer. (crying) Yes, you wish to die. I ask you for the last time, Mr. Wirz, why? And it was not fear of dismissal or court-martial or any external thing. Why, inside yourself couldn't you disobey? - Simply, I could not. I did not have that feeling inside myself to do that. I did not have that feeling of strength to be able to. I could not disobey. - The Government rests. - And on the charge that the prisoner did with others conspire to destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the United States in violation of the laws and customs of war, guilty. And on the various specifications that he aided and abetted murder and did commit murder, guilty. And the Court do therefore sentence him, the said Henry Wirz, to be hanged by the neck till he be dead at such time and place as the president of the United States may direct, 2/3 of members of the Court concur and therein. The business of this military court being now terminated, we declare this Court dissolved. (gavel thuds) (sighs) - Well, I'll say this for you, Colonel. At least you fought on your own terms. - I asked for his guilt, not his death. - And he dies anyway. His life for the Union dead. Political verdict. - I charged him for what he is. - And who cares? - I did. - What's that got to do with the real world? Men will go on most of them subject to fears, and so subject to powers in authority. How do we change that slavery when it's in man's very nature? - Is it? - We try to redecorate the beast in all sorts of political coats hoping that we will change him. But is he to be changed? - I don't know. We try. We try. (somber drumming music) (somber military music)
