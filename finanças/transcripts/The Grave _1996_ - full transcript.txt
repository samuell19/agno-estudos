And if I hand it over, I'd probably wouldn't change nothing, truth be known. See a man can want bad. You ever hear the one about the grave? The grave? Yeah, about that old grave up in Hoke county. [snickers] No, never heard of that one. [Metal voice] Hell man, that's the first one they tell. It's guaranteed to chill your shit. I don't care if you're John D. Rockefeller or Jed fucking Clampett, it ain't never enough. Now I don't know about them big cities but down here, were nobody got nothing, you get your ass whooped over a fistful of dirt. Now this here is the story of a bunch of folks. Starts off with two youngins, no-count upbringing. One of 'ems name was King and the other they called Tyn. Hmm. [Metal voice] And these boys, they had ripped off some old goat and caught him joyriding in his fancy Cadillac. A buddy of theirs squeaked on 'em and before you knew it, they was busted and sitting in the hot seat in front of the judge. Damn if both of them didn't get maxed out, 20 years a piece.

Don't cost all I want done is to take care of Limonjillo. Goddamn rump ranger. I'm telling you man the guy is on my ass all day, every day. He's fucking everywhere man.
