Ireland, 1922: After a long and turbulent struggle, Irish separatists have forced Britain to withdraw from most of the island of Ireland, bringing centuries of colonial rule to an end. The Irish public are ecstatic that they have stood up to Great Britain and the country is still standing. But at this moment of independence, the new Irish Free State descends into brutal Civil War. (GUNS/CANNONS ROARING) The Irish Civil War is a war among fellow citizens, people who recognise themselves as part of the same community and that, I think, captures the horror of civil war over its long history. As the new State is engulfed by war, few regions or communities escape. Friends and families are torn apart. Ashe referred to the Civil War as a scar on the soul of Ireland and it leaves spiritual wounds that fester for generations. "Ready!" Desperate to prove they can govern the Irish Free State, "Aim!" the new government officially executes 81 men by firing squad. "Fire!" (GUN SHOTS) The State's National Army acts with impunity. Young men dragged from their homes, their tortured bodies left on roadsides for families to claim. Those who resist the new State also resort to brutal tactics: assassinations, arson, attacks on families, lethal ambushes of former comrades. (GUN SHOTS) People were seeing people be murdered. They've also been part of things that were going to have to live with for the rest of their lives. The legacy of the Civil War will haunt Irish society and politics for decades to come. Some are so imbittered they feel like the revolution has completely failed, they feel like they've wasted their youth. It split the independence movement and has mostly put an end to the dreams and hopes that it would end in glory. In the first decades of the 20th century Irish revolutionaries achieved something extraordinary and unexpected. They then come close to destroying it. Ireland wakes to a truce and peace. After two and a half dark years of conflict the Irish War of Independence has been suspended. People gather at Dublin's Mansion House to mark the moment. When the truce was declared, everybody was delighted. The summer of 1921 was a gorgeous summer. It was absolutely wonderful. And between the lifting of the curfew and the disappearance of the Auxiliaries and the Black and Tans off the street, people began to think we actually had something. As calm settles, British troops and police return to barracks. Exhausted after years of war, some IRA volunteers go home. But others remain in the field, ready to resume the fight against Britain if necessary. The Truce allows people the opportunity to do things long-postponed. Parties and prayer vigils are held; people get married; (WHISTLE BLOWING) ..some play or watch their favourite sports; (CROWDS CHEERING) ..fairs and markets spring back to life. (WHISTLE AND BANGS OF FIREWORKS) There was this great sense of celebration. There was a great hope that a new future of Ireland could be achieved. As the Truce settles, the president of the Irish Republic, EÉmon de Valera, is invited by British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, for talks in London. Massive crowds and the world's press follow every step. Lloyd George informs de Valera that he is committed to securing peace in Ireland. De Valera tells the Prime Minister that the people have mandated him to establish an Irish Republic. The Irish Republicans thought the Republic was going to deliver a complete transformation of life. Part of the problem of, perhaps, the excessive demonisation of British rule was the assumption was once you cast it off everything would be wonderful. (MUSIC INTENSIFIES AND DIES) (WAVES CRASHING/BIRDS SCREECHING) The pursuit of independence in Ireland was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of liberty, fraternity and equality, which by the late 1700s had fueled popular revolutions in America, France and Ireland. The Irish Rebellion of 1798 was soon supressed, but its example would encourage radical nationalists for centuries to come. Constitutional nationalists in Ireland, meanwhile, including Daniel O'Connell and Charles Stewart Parnell campaigned to for the achievement of self-government by peaceful means through the political system in London. In 1914, the Irish Parliamentary Party seemed on the verge of success when, despite intense opposition from Unionists who wished to remain in the United Kingdom, the Third Home Rule Bill was passed by Parliament in Westminster. (CANNONS ROARING) But with the outbreak of the First World War, Irish Home Rule was postponed. Sensing betrayal and political opportunity, in Easter 1916, a small group of militant Irish separatists staged a rebellion and unilaterally proclaimed an Irish Republic. (CANNON ROARING/MACHINERY CLANKING) Britain easily quashed the rebellion. Ready! Aim! Fire! (GUN SHOTS) But when the British executed 16 of the rebellion's leaders, and then tried to introduce mass conscription, the angered Irish public changed its mind. Now popular support moved away from Home Rule towards the pull of a fully independent Republic as advocated by the radical nationalist party Sinn Feén and the rebels of 1916. For a lot of these revolutionaries, the idea of the Irish Republic meant the values that were included in the 1916 Proclamation, whether that was the religious liberties, civil liberties, equality for all; that all would be equal, we have the question of gender equality. This was to be a state where everybody was afforded the same rights in the state and where wealth was somewhat equally shared. The national movement that builds around Sinn Feén encompasses large swathes of society. Left, right, and centre, big business and small farmers, the Catholic Church, former Home-Rulers and the Labour Movement, feminists, land agitators and radicals. All coalesce around the common of a sovereign Irish nation. At that moment, Sinn Feén is a very broad church. It was kind of a joke, that Sinn Feén often... it's informal policy was, independence first, everything else after. We can attend to those other economic and social issues after independence. When the First World War ends in 1918, a general election is held. With its goal of an independent Irish Republic, Sinn Feén wins by a landslide. Only in the North-East is the result different. Here, Unionists, many descended from the conquest planters of the 1600s, have long rejected the idea of Irish independence. Unionists are increasingly of the view that they might be able to siphon off some of the northern counties, which would remain in a Union relationship with Great Britain. Of course from the Nationalist perspective, with a substantial Nationalist minority within those six counties and with slight Nationalist majorities in Tyrone and Fermanagh, the six-county demand is anathema. So that election is very polarising. Ireland is pulling in different directions. There's no doubt about that. Bolstered by their mandate, Sinn Feén TDs meet in Dublin's Mansion House. Here they form an underground parliament called Daál EÉreann. Without seeking permission from Britain, they declare independence and swear an oath to defend the Republic. "We the elected representatives of the ancient Irish people ratify the establishment of the Irish Republic and pledge to make this Declaration effective by every means at our command." What goes on in Ireland from 1916-1923, is what's going on across Europe, or even globally, in places like Russia, places like the Baltics, Finland and Poland. But also places like Mexico, China, Mongolia. There are revolutions and a kind of common thread is ordinary working people, who have been denied access to elevated positions of social status and education, financial gain - have been politicised. Republics are cropping up everywhere. Monarchies are falling. Over 20 dynasties are falling at the end of the First World War and there's a sense of a kind of new world being made. And there's a sense of the Apocalypse arriving for many of those on the right and many middle-class groups who see Bolshevism coming out of Russia as this real danger. And revolution that is going to spread that across the world. (MENACING MUSIC PLAYS) The revolutionary Daál sends a delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. Here, new nations are being formed as the Allies divide the spoils of the First World War. But on Britain's insistence, the Irish are ignored. Now Daál EÉreann feels it has no choice but to fight and to protect the Irish Republic. The period between 1918-1921 is relatively unusual in Irish Nationalism, in the sense that Irish Nationalism is usually fragmented between different factions with different political outlooks. But what you find from the General Election up until the Truce there is a real unity brought about by the struggle for the Republic. (GUN SHOTS) Britain directs its overwhelming military power against the Irish Independence Movement. The Irish public mount campaigns of mass civil disobedience while the IRA and the women's Republican organisation - Cumann na mBan - use innovative guerilla tactics to attack and consistently undermine British forces. Daál EÉreann sets up courts, policing and tax collection. All in the name of the Irish Republic. The British, they had encountered conspiracies and insurrections. But they had never encountered this consistent programme of alternative administration which meant that as you drove out, as you pushed out British power, you substituted a Republican structure. That's revolutionary. The British government responds with brutal reprisals and punishment attacks on Irish citizens; tactics that become difficult to defend as the world's press watches. Sinn Feén mounts a sophisticated propaganda war and in America, rallies the Irish diaspora to pressure Britain into agreeing a settlement. In July 1921, the British government accepts that Irish solidarity would be impossible to overcome and agrees to the Truce. The carnage comes to a halt. Three months later, de Valera and Daál EÉreann send a negotiating team to London, led by Sinn Feén founder Arthur Griffith and 31-year-old IRA and Daál EÉreann leader Michael Collins. They are arriving as equals. That's how they hold themselves, that's how they stand out. They have lost their deference to the Imperial masters of the world. In Downing Street, the Irish face a powerful team led by David Lloyd George and Secretary of State for the Colonies Winston Churchill. In response to the Irish demand for a Republic, Lloyd George is clear. Full sovereign independence will not be granted. There was no question at any stage of Ireland getting a republic. That would be a confession of total, utter British defeat. It would demoralise British at home. It would undermine British control and authority in the Empire. Instead of an Independent republic, Britain offers the Irish "Dominion Status". They can have self-government, but must remain within the British Empire. So you will have a status like Canada, South Africa, Australia and the British are absolutely insistent that the Irish are getting a good deal. And they know that in terms of elite opinion in Ireland if you had asked anyone from 1916 to 1921, whether Dominion Status was a generous offer, they would have said it was an incredibly generous offer. Crucially, the British team insists that Irish elected representatives will have to swear allegiance to the British Sovereign. It was an oath of allegiance to the British King. That was hugely problematic for Republicans. (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYS) In Northern Ireland, Unionists and Nationalists watch anxiously as the talks unfold. In 1920, before the end of the War of Independence, in order to assuage Unionists, the British government had introduced the Government of Ireland Act, which divided the island into two polities; Southern Ireland, consisting of 26 counties, and the six-county Northern Ireland which was to remain part of the United Kingdom. The British claim to the six counties was clearly demographically, electorally, ethically problematic. At least two counties had clear majorities in favour of incorporation in the Irish Free State and all the border areas without exception would have preferred to be part of the Irish Free State. Northern Ireland's Prime Minister and Unionist leader James Craig, fears the Treaty will result in Southern Ireland being granted parts of Northern Ireland's territory, where Catholics are in a majority. David Lloyd George's coalition government relies on the support of pro-Unionist conservatives in Westminster. They side with the Unionists. The Irish border must not be altered. To ensure that the negotiations don't fail on this issue, Lloyd George proposes the establishment of a Boundary Commission. It will examine the issue of border territory at a later stage. I think that the Boundary Commission is sold by Lloyd George very smartly in December 1921. He implies to Unionists that there is likely to be minor revisions flowing out from the Boundary Commission. He indicates to Nationalists that this will be a substantial recalibration of the border between Northern Ireland and the South. As talks continue into winter, the Irish delegates travel between London and Dublin, taking council from Daál EÉreann and de Valera's cabinet. But even so, the IRA, Cumann na mBan and the wider public are not informed that a Republic may not be achievable. There was a real failure to dampen expectations. It was clear in the words of Lloyd George, it was clear in the words of Churchill at the time. Irish unity, yes, but Irish unity within the Empire. It's not the independence that the hard-line military, those who have given most in the field, it's not what they had fought for. The Republic is what they had fought for and any negotiation was going to fall short of that Republic. A huge failure of leadership - both collectively and with respect to de Valera. It was a huge failure of leadership. (WAVES CRASHING) Late in the negotiations, the talks come close to collapse. Lloyd George delivers an ultimatum: sign or return to immediate and terrible war. There were serious plans for a drastic form of warfare and of course, the British were prepared to fight. In Dublin, de Valera and the Cabinet are ready to assess the final terms. But no telegraph comes from London. The delegation has decided to exercise their powers as plenipotentiaries. At 02:15 AM on December 6 1921, the Irish co-sign the Anglo-Irish Treaty with their British counterparts without seeking permission from Dublin. I think by the time we get to December '21 Arthur Griffith, but also Michael Collins, felt that they had achieved the substance of independence and that was an agreement they could bring home and sell. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 provides for the establishment of an Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The new Irish Free State will have many of the freedoms of an independent state, including its own army and control over its finances. But this is no republic. It is a dominion of the British Empire. And the island would remain partitioned. The signing brings hope, however. Perhaps at last, Ireland's long, difficult struggle with Britain is reaching its end. December 1921: The Irish Republic greets the conclusion of the Treaty negotiations with relief and optimism. In America, where many among the diaspora had supported the Irish nationalist cause for decades, the results are a profound relief. Initially, there was a flood of telegrams. There were all kinds of people responding to the news of the Treaty and much of the initial response was very positive. The view from afar was that this Treaty meant peace, it meant sovereignty, that this was the culmination of the revolution. As Christmas nears, Sinn Feén TDs gather in Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin to debate the terms of the Treaty. The Treaty must be passed by a majority of Daál EÉreann if it is to become law. Outside, every word spoken inside is interrogated and discussed. It's a very rare thing for a country that's on the precipice of something as enormous as independence to stand around for two weeks and discuss what this means. There's huge emotion and lots of venom because there's so much at stake. Among the first to speak is Michael Collins. "As one of the signatories, I naturally recommend its acceptance. In my opinion, it gives us freedom. Not the ultimate freedom that all nations desire and develop to, but the freedom to achieve it." Over the two-week long debate, there are profoundly divergent views amongst the 124 TDs. "It seems to me that the taking of those oaths is a moral surrender. It is giving up the independence of our country and that is the main reason why I object to this Treaty. The Republic is not dead and will not die." They have been mandate by the electorate to fight for a Republic but they're now dealing with something that falls far short of that Republic. Significantly, EÉmon de Valera stands against the Treaty. "The Treaty is not a stepping stone, but a barrier in the way of complete independence. Britain will hold us to that contract." Now, the precious solidarity that had sustained the independence movement starts to tear apart. The argument is made by several of the Anti-Treatyites that agreeing to the Treaty will the first time that Irish people have voluntarily agreed to be part of the British Empire. This means we'll will be complicit in the oppression of other people within the Empire; the Indians and the Egyptians, for example. As tensions mount, some raise the spectre of war. "I do not want any fighting unless it is absolutely necessary but if the conditions were that our people must become British subjects, I would say I am not going to agree to that." Though no TD is wholly satisfied, there are many who argue that the Treaty should be accepted for pragmatic reasons. "The Treaty seems to me to re-establish justice, to secure peace at home and goodwill will with all nations and to constitute a national polity with equal rights and opportunity for every citizen." The argument was: "Give us the time to do this, to build up the State, to build up the army, to build up the economy." When TDs return to their constituencies for Christmas, the Catholic hierarchy seizes the moment to make its position clear. "The people of Ireland by a vast majority are in favour of the Treaty and in a democratic country, the will of the people is the final court of appeal." The role of the Catholic Church is very important here, of course. The fact that the whole elite kind of row in behind the Pro-Treaty side the Catholic Church gives its blessing to it. Newspapers almost universally endorse the Treaty, as do most of the pre-revolutionary elite. Civic and political organisations also use the Christmas break to influence the debate. "We, the Inishowen Rural District Council, appeal to the TDs for North Donegal to ratify the Treaty. The desire of the people is for quietness." (WAVES LIGHTLY CRASHING) (MUSIC LOUDENS) On January 7th 1922, with the Daál reconvened, Arthur Griffith makes the closing argument. "I belong to the Irish people. They are flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone. I say now to the people of Ireland that it is their right for the first time in seven centuries to take their place amongst the nations of Europe." Crowds wait in the cold outside as the Daál votes. The result is tight. 64 Deputies are pro-Treaty. 57 are anti-Treaty. Days later, anti-Treaty TDs including Countess Markievicz, Cathal Brugha, Margaret Pearse and EÉmon de Valera gather for a defining photograph. On January 14th, the pro-Treaty TDs established the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State. With de Valera's resignation, Arthur Griffith is elected president of Daál EÉreann. Michael Collins becomes Chairmen of the Provisional Government of the Free State. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) Within days of the Treaty's ratification, the British withdrawal begins. One of the most important arguments on the pro-Treaty side was the Treaty offered, for the first time, the prospect of the British military leaving most of Ireland, and that was huge. After centuries of occupation, there was jubilation. British forces are leaving Irish shores. Thousands of Republican prisoners are released en masse. British army administrative and support systems also close and depart. It causes economic hardship in places that had long thrived as garrison towns. But despite the British withdrawal, discontent builds throughout the movement. The Treaty was a watering down of all for what we had fought for. And the taking of life to me was a very, very serious matter. I didn't do it lightly. But I wouldn't have given one night out of bed, or hurt anybody for the getting of the Treaty. They would have seen the symbolism, they would have seen the crown and in British constitution theory the crown is sovereign. Does that mean that the new Irish State is not sovereign? Dominion Status, does that mean we are not an ancient European nation but a former British colony like Canada or Australia? And then of course, the question of the Oath. I couldn't swallow an Oath of Allegiance to the King of England. Not today. I couldn't swallow it. I couldn't do it. Not for a million pounds, could I do it. Not for all of Ireland, could I do it. As division spreads, the Republican Women's Organisation Cumann na mBan meets to vote on whether to accept the Treaty. Of 482 women present, just 63 vote pro-Treaty. These women leave to establish a new organisation - Cumann na Saoirse. The remaining 419 anti-Treaty women declared they would resist the Irish Free State any way they can. They go back to the foundation stone I think, of Republican women on looking at the future which is "What did the Proclamation say"? They do have some very idealistic notions of the freedom that women had in Gaelic Ireland. But the Treaty brings us to somewhere else. We're under the English King, we're not going to get our freedom. (LUAS TRAIN RUMBLES) Five weeks later, IRA leaders from across Ireland meet in Dublin to have their voices heard on the Treaty. The government has banned the gathering. Many arrive armed, unsure of what to expect. "We were great believers then in the power of the gun alone to cure all our evils." As debate rages, strong support for the pro-Treaty side is evident among the eastern and midlands divisions of the IRA. They include members of Michael Collins's former squad and the Dublin Brigade, which was particularly effective during the War of Independence. Many of these IRA men joined a new National Army. They will fight for and protect the Irish Free State. (ENGINES REVVING) But the largest and most powerful units of the IRA, the southern and western divisions, stand firmly against the Treaty. It's estimated up to 70% of the IRA were opposed to the terms of the Treaty. Many of those who see themselves as soldiers of the Republic don't care what the politicians think or what the politicians say. (CITY BUSTLING/SIRENS WAIL) Vowing to defend the Irish Republic by force if needed, the anti-Treaty IRA elects an executive which immediately repudiates the Irish Free State. Now two competing armies jostle for position in the new State - the National Army and the anti-Treaty IRA. So, there's a vacuum there left by the British, when the army leaves and the police leave and there's a fight to fill that vacuum between the two sundering sides of the IRA. Anti-Treaty IRA occupy evacuated barracks. Within weeks, they control two thirds of the towns, villages and cities across the country. In fact, the National Army write the British General Headquarters and complain about how quickly they vacate from the main barracks in Limerick City. So, quite bizarrely, after 750 years, the British have left Limerick too soon. Although they control most of the territory of the Free State, the anti-Treaty leadership is divided about what do to next. Option 1 is declare a military dictatorship and seize control of the new Provisional Government, arrest all those political leaders and attack the emerging National Army. That's Option 1. Option 2 is you seek a compromise and renegotiate the terms of the Treaty. There are at least two camps: Hardliners like Ernie O'Malley who are perfectly willing to fight a civil war, to engage old comrades militarily. There are more moderate influences, the likes of Liam Lynch who will do almost anything to avoid civil war. Newly appointed as IRA Chief of Staff, Liam Lynch, a former shop assistant and one of the most successful guerilla leaders of the War of Independence, hopes he can convince former comrades who have joined the pro-Treaty side to reunite. Together, perhaps they can force Britain to renegotiate the Treaty and grant a republic. The Hardliners, led by Rory O'Connor and Liam Mellows believe only radical action will work. O'Connor and others saw themselves as uncompromising Republicans who believe, ultimately that, if defending the Republic meant attacking the new administration, then so be it. (MUSIC INTENSIFIES AND EBBS) In April, the Hardliners lead 200 armed IRA Volunteers into the Four Courts. Here, in the seat of judicial power, they establish the anti-Treaty IRA Executive's HQ. Crowds gather on the banks of the Liffey to watch. Inside, IRA men pose for photographs. In London, news that the IRA have taken the Four Courts worries Winston Churchill. Churchill has been made responsible by the British government for ensuring the Free State is successfully established. In April 1922, Winston Churchill writes to Michael Collins and says the Provisional Government must assert itself or perish and be replaced by some other form of control. But the National Army is as yet too weak to take on the might of the anti-Treaty IRA. And the Provisional Government is already busy putting out fires on other fronts. (RAINFALL) This is a power vacuum. We are lacking in effective policing and an effective justice system so there is this degree of chaos. There was violence. The country was awash with handguns. And bank robberies were endemic. "Where there was order, chaos rears its head. Friendship and trust give way to bitterness and suspicion. The guns which did such good service against the usurper are now flourished in the faces of Irish citizens." Years of war and political neglect have left the Irish economy weak and impoverished. It's estimated that up to 130,000 people were unemployed in Ireland in the first half of 1922. People have very obvious material concerns. What they desire is normality. They want an opportunity for bread and butter issues to be addressed. Angry workers call strikes and declared soviets. Railways are brought to a halt. What you're seeing in organised labour is a desperate effort to resist wage reductions across all industries. This takes very militant forms and you start seeing sabotage. (CROWDS CLAMOURING) There's a real fear of civil war in this moment. There is a fear civil wars can lead to unintended consequences, that Bolshevism can creep in. Everybody is aware of the Russian Civil War and the violence and the atrocities that came with that. Across society, there are demands for law and order. People are unsettled by the lack of governance. Support grows for the Provisional Government. There's, very quickly, an alignment of forces whereby the pro-Treaty wing of the Free State identifies very strongly with the employers, the press, the middle-class, the property owners, the big farmers, the Church, Big Business. All row in behind the Treaty. There is a very clear class dimension. Even though the Treaty split isn't a class split, as such, there's a very clear class dimension evident. (CROWDS CHEERING) Throughout March and April, political leaders on all sides travel the country to consolidate support. People were hungry to hear from politicians so when Collins and de Valera went around talking, they garnered huge crowds of people. "In order to achieve freedom, these men would have to march over the dead bodies of their own brothers. They will have to wade through Irish blood." "Mr. de Valera and his friends are stepping into the shoes of the departing enemy by attempting to prevent, in their autocratic manner, the right of the Irish people to rule themselves." When Collins addresses a rally in Cork, fights break out. Shots are fired. (GUN SHOTS/SCREAMING) (DRAMATIC MUSIL PLAYS) For the young polity of Northern Ireland, the first months of 1922 were also marred by chaos, sectarian attacks and killings. By April, 127 Catholics and 72 Protestants have been killed. Such events strike among both Catholic and Protestant communities. There are sectarian outrages in reaction to events that had occurred in the South. Very extensive expulsions of cultural Catholics from factories and from premises and from places of work. And at the same time, we get burnings and shootings. What we see is a tit for tat, atrocity for atrocity. And for the population, that is terrifying. Look, there's massive conflict in the streets of Belfast. There is a civil war going on in the streets. It's pretty brutal. (GUN SHOTS/SCREAMING) It's worse for Catholics because they're the minority. (FIRE CRACKLING) To protect his polity's status within the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Craig introduces the Special Powers Act, with gives police extraordinary powers of arrest. Craig also forms a new armed police force. What Craig does is, in effect, convert the Ulster Volunteer force veterans of World War 1 into a special constabulary, divided into three units - A, B, and C. It's the B Specials that are most remembered because these were the least disciplined. Fearing the escalating violence, thousands of Catholics flee south to the Irish Free State. Dundalk, Drogheda and particularly Dublin City see the arrival of thousands of people; often women and children in spring 1922. Motivated to help Northern Catholics and to undermine Northern Ireland, Michael Collins and Liam Lynch arrange for weapons and funds to be sent to the IRA in the North. Collins is playing a very deep double-game here with his Northern Irish IRA offensive. If they can reignite a kind of sense of togetherness through attacking Northern Ireland, then somehow that will avoid civil war. Michael Collins and James Craig enter talks to de-escalate tensions. But in secret, Collins continues to supply guns to the Northern IRA. By late April in the Free State, fears are rising. Perhaps civil war is unavoidable. You've got clashes in Kilkenny where several people, including civilians, are killed. (GUN SHOTS) And in Athlone where Free State Army General George Adamson is killed. (GUN SHOTS CONTINUE) Throughout the State, people try to halt the slide to war. The Irish Trade Union Congress strikes in the call for peace. In every part of Ireland, workers laid down tools so there's a real sense that workers across Ireland, the labour movement and trade Unionists in general, are absolutely opposed to the way that this is going. A lot of voices try to stop this. Anti-Treaty IRA leaders, National Army generals, bishops, there's a women's peace movement. In May, moderate anti-Treaty IRA officers called for calm. IRA Commandant Seaá O'Hegarty is invited to address the Daál. "What does civil war mean? That you break the country so utterly that England simply walks in and has her way? You will destroy any idea of a Republic". The General Election, the first in the Free State, is scheduled for June. In an attempt to stabilise the political situation, EÉmon de Valera and Michael Collins negotiate a pact by which pro- and anti-Treaty Sinn Feén candidates will stand together as a coalition. (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) To ensure the Ira supports the election, Collins intimates that the Oath of Fidelity will be dropped from the new constitution of the Irish Free State. This was yet another attempt by Collins to find some way of keeping the two factions of the IRA together. That's what really terrifies London because it looks like the reconstitution of Republican unity and the reconstitution of Republican unity might mean a settlement which tears up the Treaty. The British talk about the emergence of a Republic as a thing that might just happen anytime now. Then the army will have to go back and it will be a war. May 1922: the Donegal/Fermanagh border. The IRA, in another assault on the territory of Northern Ireland, occupies the villages of Belleek and Pettigo. This time, Churchill is ready. Two battalions of troops have been moved into Northern Ireland. They unleash an overwhelming assault on the IRA. (CANNONS FIRE) (GUN SHOTS) (SHOTS CONTINUE) (EXPLOSIONS) After five days of fighting, the IRA retreats. Britain's point is made. Northern Ireland must not be touched by either the IRA or the Irish Free State. Even so, watching from Westminster, Churchill remains wary. The British really feared that Collins would eventually go over to the Republican side. The fact that these endless conversations between all the elements of the IRA, that kind of fueled this British paranoia. Churchill orders General Macready, commander of the remaining British forces in Ireland, to be ready for war should any attempt be made to establish an Irish Republic. He then informs Collins that the oath must be included in the constitution. It's the rejection of Michael Collins's effort to produce a Republican constitution on the British side, a rejection based on the renewed threat to war, it's that rejection that I think makes civil war much more likely. The new constitution is released on the morning on which the General Election is held. Despite Michael Collins's intimations to the contrary, the Oath remains and the status of the new Irish State in the British Community of Nations is confirmed. When the results are counted, though many seats were uncontested, pro-Treaty Sinn Feén candidates have won 58 seats and anti-Sinn Feén have won 36. The Farmers' Party wins 7 seats and Labour wins an unprecedented 17 seats. Viewed solely on their Treaty stance of the 1st Preference Vote, while anti-Treaty candidates win just 22%, pro-Treaty candidates have won 78%. If you look at the election as a referendum on the Treaty, the sense is that this was a fairly substantial public vote in favour of the Treaty and that was very much to the benefit of the Provisional Government going forward and I think it strengthened their hand. This huge pro-Treaty vote alters the political calculus. Newly confident, the Provisional Government abandons the idea of the coalition pact. Enraged, the anti-Treaty side claims that Collins had betrayed their goodwill and that the election had been influenced by Britain's threat of a return to war. But business, farmers, the Catholic Church, along with the majority of the people see the results as a mandate for peace and the legitimisation of the Provisional Government. "The result is an indication of the good sense of the people; the will to replace the rule of the gun by ordered government." Six days later, British war hero and Unionist MP Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson nears his home in London, having unveiled a war memorial. Lying in wait are two young IRA operatives who are also British Army war veterans - Joseph O'Sullivan and Reginald Dunne. (LOUD GUN SHOTS) Henry Wilson was spectacularly assassinated by two IRA men, one of whom had a wooden leg and couldn't run quickly. They were both captured. Wilson is assassinated in what's really the world of the elites in London, and so the idea that a man of his status could be killed on his own doorstep in Eaton Square, one of the grandest addresses in London, sends shockwaves through the Cabinet. They all fear they will be next; they all live in the same area. Though it remains disputed who authorised Wilson's assassination, the British Cabinet blames the IRA in the Four Courts. Churchill orders Macready to prepare to attack the Four Courts. Macready warns Churchill that a British attack in the Free State could reunite the Republican movement against Britain. Macready convinces Churchill to ask Collins to do it; to make the Provisional Government do it. The British government basically turned to Collins and said: "If you don't do something to get those out of the Four Courts, then we will". Churchill finds Collins in the Provisional Government unexpectedly willing to act against the anti-Treaty IRA. The British government wanted action but so did Collins. He had now the support of the people - 78% He had his mandate. Now was the time to strike. And he was confident that he could win quickly. The Provisional Government sends word to Churchill. They will attack and force the anti-Treaty Republicans from the Four Courts. But the National Army is hardly ready for war. "We had about 8000 men in the army at the time but only around 6000 were armed. The machine gunners had to be taught how to handle the guns the night before the fight." With rifles, machine guns and field guns supplied by Britain, the National Army surrounds the Four Courts. Artillery is placed strategically on the southern banks of the Liffey and behind the 1000-year-old St. Michan's Church to the north. (BELL TOLLING) On the night of June the 27th, Collins issues orders. The attack begins at dawn. It happened quite suddenly and quite violently, really, in that they were given an ultimatum to evacuate the Four Courts. They were given 20 minutes to evacuate the building which wasn't practical, it was not going to happen. Then the Four Courts is bombarded at 04:07 on that June morning. (LOUD SHOT FIRED) As shells fall on the Four Courts, those inside have to prepare for the worst. "The boys all laid down in the sight of the Decade of the Rosary in Irish placing themselves under the protection of the Blessed Virgin and all patriot martyrs of the Irish Republic." With superior fire power, National Army leaders are certain the conflict will be short-lived. But something fundamental has changed. The Free State attack against the Four Courts has compelled moderates to choose sides. (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) The moderate militant wings of the IRA have been talking to each other. As soon as they watch that attack on the Four Courts, the moderate wing decided that they were going to stand by the Republic. United, anti-Treaty Republicans can draw on up to 80,000 men to counter the forces of the Provisional Government. (GUN SHOTS CONTINUE) Having ended British occupation in most of the island, now Irish will fight Irish to decide the fate of the Irish Free State. (MUSIC BUILDS INTENSLY) (SOUNDS OF GUN SHOTS ECHO AND RETREAT) Spring, 1922. Irish separatists have forced Britain through a long military and political campaign to withdraw from most of the island of Ireland bringing centuries of British rule to an end. While Northern Ireland stays within the United Kingdom, 26 County Irish Free State gains a large degree of control over its own affairs, though it must remain part of the British Empire. The terms of the Anglo Irish Treaty split the Irish people. I thought the treaty was a good thing for this country. Twas the first chance we got to have our own regime. I wasn't going to give allegiance to any foreign king. The treaty was a watering down of all we ever fought for. I hate them. 'Anti-treaty Republicans viewed the treaty as a betrayal of the Republic declared in 1916 and 1919, and are prepared to counter the new state.' They have a belief in the republic. They are prepared to sacrifice themselves for that republic. 'Anti-treaty IRA occupy evacuated British army barracks and set up headquarters in the Four Courts. Violence flares throughout the country. There are fears the new state will die moments after its birth. There's a sense of the Apocalypse arriving, for many of those on the right and many middle-class groups who see Bolshevism coming out of Russia as this real danger and revolution is something that's going to spread across the world. 'Northern Ireland also sees conflict and death.' There is a horrendous period of concentrated violence. '220 Catholics and Protestants are killed in just four months. In the Irish Free State amid widespread calls for calm, a general election is held. The pro-treaty side wins a sizeable majority, leading many to hope Civil War can be avoided. But when IRA volunteers assassinate Sir Henry Wilson in London... (gunshot) Britain demands that Michael Collins and the provisional government must attack the anti-treaty IRA in the Four Courts. Irish turn on Irish. (explosion) The Civil War has begun. "The only emotions of the people in the Civil War that I seem to remember, are those of hatred." It takes generations to wipe out the bitterness of a civil war. And 'twas bloody awful, I can tell you that. (EXPLOSIONS) 'I remember being roused by Liam Lynch. 'Do you not hear the shelling?' The Free State Army have been bombarding the Four Courts for the past two hours.' 'We were silent. For both of us, that was the end of a dream.' June 28th, 1922. 'Since first light, the Irish National Army has maintained constant fire on the Republican headquarters in the Four Courts.' (HEAVY SHELLING) (SHELLS WHISTLING, EXPLOSIONS). The Four Courts is getting bombarded from every direction. (LOUD BLAST) From one gun alone, there were 375 shells fired. So multiply that by three. 'Within the Four Courts, the IRA men and Cumann na mBan women are stunned by the onslaught. (EXPLOSIONS) The anti-treaty IRA in the Four Courts, they had no plan. Partially because they didn't psychologically expect the war to start. Really, just fundamentally, they thought they were going to find a way of avoiding this. 'On the third day, a National Army shell hits the Records Office to the rear where the IRA has stored munitions. A vast explosion rocks the city centre. (LOUD BLAST). "I was there for the big explosion. This great noise came and the place, it shook. And rubble or light stuff slithered down my back." A huge mushroom cloud, like an atomic weapon, rose over Dublin City, immortalised in a photograph from the time. A shower of paper from the Public Record Office. So the archive going back to the 12th century, you know, littered down on Dublin in fragments. 'The explosion seemed to give an extra push to roaring orange flames, which formed patterns across the sky.' 'It can't be long now, I thought, until the real noise comes.' With the Four Courts in flames, Republicans evacuate. That building is captured and much of the IRA executive is captured. It looks like the anti-treaty militants have been decapitated. 'Most of the 180 strong Four Courts garrison is arrested, including leaders Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows and Joe McKelvey.' A few Republicans, including Ernie O'Malley and future Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, escape, aided by former IRA comrades now on the Free State side. (marching music) VO: With the Four Courts collapsing, a force of 700 anti-treaty IRA men and Cumann na mBan women assembles in the city centre. Here they take over buildings, including many on Sackville Street, now O'Connell Street, through which they knocked passages to create one continuous block. Senior Republican political leaders turn up in support. EÉmon de Valera shows up. Seaá T. O'Kelly shows up, Cathal Brugha shows up, who were all ministers from before the split in the Daál government. You have about 30 women in that line of hotels on the east side of O'Connell Street, where the fighting moves. They're loading guns. They're taking an extremely active military role at that stage. 'National Army troops move into the city under the command of two veterans of the War of Independence, Waterford native Richard Mulcahy and the 24 year old former British Army captain Emmett Dalton.' The GPO, where six years previously Irish rebels proclaimed a Republic, now becomes a key National Army position. (gunshot) The IRA is well armed, but the National Army has superior British guns, supplied under the orders of British Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill. Once the attack on the Four Courts began, Churchill became wildly enthusiastic and promised the Provisional Government whatever military assistance it wanted. That's Churchill's attitude. It's incredible relief. If you need military help, no problem. We're not going to let you lose this war. 'Buildings in the city centre are engulfed in flames as the conflict rages over several days and nights.' There wasn't any respect for property. They blew to bits shops, hotels, any positions taken up by the Anti-Treaty side. So the east side of O'Connell Street, which had survived the 1916 Rising, a lot of that was levelled in the battle for Dublin. 'Police and army struggled to keep curious onlookers away from the fight.' People were living just a block behind O'Connell Street, and they came out to see what was happening. I suppose there was disbelief, and unfortunately, you do have a number of civilians that were caught in the crossfire. 'In crossfire, 35 civilians are killed, including several young children.' (mournful music) "Pathetic sights. In one house, two children lay dead Owing to conditions outside, it was undesirable to remove the bodies." 'After a week's fighting, the National Army prepares a major assault to finish the anti-treaty Republicans off completely. "We attacked O'Connell Street at one a.m. Shot up every post, particularly the Hammam and Gresham hotels, which were also bombed with rifle grenades." 'It's not long before the anti-treaty side, accept their position is lost.' (FEMALE VOICE) 'Sé do bheatha a Mhuire...' "We tried to pray. Someone started the rosary. Walls shook. We were almost covered with dust and whitewash, but we were alive." 'Defeated, anti-treaty IRA and Cumann na mBan step into the morning light. But one of their leaders, Cathal Brugha former minister of Dáil Éireann and hero of the 1916 rebellion, refuses to surrender. He escapes into a rear alley where he is shot by a Free State bullet.' (GUNSHOT) 'Brugha becomes the first senior leader of either side to die in the Civil War.' This was a symbolic death of a man who was a brave and honourable man, and his death was deeply regretted, even by those who disagreed with him on most issues of the time. 'As the dust settles and guests who have been evicted from their hotels scurry to safety, the costs of the Battle of Dublin become clear.' 'The city centre is in ruins. 500 Republicans are imprisoned. 81 people have been killed.' (slow, mournful music) In London, Winston Churchill and General Neville McCready, Commander of the remaining British forces still in Ireland, greet the news that the Irish provisional government has effectively suppressed the anti-treaty resistance with relief. McCready rights to an acquaintance of his. 'It was probably impossible for us to put down the rebels, but now the Irish are doing it, and they appear to be having a great deal of success. Remember, the long goal of the British is to have Ireland stable. This is the pioneer new form of Dominion status that they have tried to experiment with in Ireland. They've given Ireland more than they've given anywhere else. They want this to work. The other Dominions are watching. 'Britain's continued involvement in the new Irish state's affairs, however, enrages Republicans.' "England has again waged war upon us. This time she has employed Irish men to do her dirty work. I regret to say that this latest phase of Ireland's struggle is bound to be more terrible than anything that has yet occurred." ## The provisional government has triumphed in Dublin. A lot of the kind of the senior generals in the National Army thought that was gonna be the end of it. What they didn't anticipate was, that the attack on the Four Courts would be seen as an attack on the Republic and that the anti-treaty forces across the country would mobilise and they mobilise really rapidly. And what had started as an attack on one building or series of buildings in Dublin City Centre, soon spread across the country and became a national struggle. Once the anti-Treatyites were forced out of the city, hardening does take place among the rest of the Republican forces and people like Liam Lynch, he feels he's been strung along by the pro-Treatyites. That they weren't really serious about peace, that ultimately they've gone ahead and carried out Britain's wishes. So from now on, it's war. ## 'Beyond Dublin, anti-treatyite Republicans already controlled most of the country, including large tracts of Munster and Connacht. The first weeks of July are scarred by violent clashes across the state as the two sides struggled for control.' Enniscorthy is taken after heavy fighting by 250 anti-treaty IRA men under the command of Ernie O'Malley. New Ross falls to Sean Moylan's unit of 230 men.' 'Once the civil war is underway, political leaders of the anti-treaty side, including Eamon de Valera, who had been a pivotal force in the independence struggle, are relegated to the margins. De Valera, frankly admitted in private that he was quite powerless during this period. Those in senior positions in the IRA are not listening to him. He is losing control of the movement. 'Military control of the movement rests for the most part with two commanders. A 26 year old clerk from Cork, Liam Deasy, and a 29 year old former shop assistant from Limerick, Liam Lynch. Lynch sets about building a Republican stronghold in the southwest. It becomes known as the Munster Republic. Liam Lynch's notional defensive line protecting the Munster Republic runs from Limerick in the west, bordered to the north by the River Shannon, across Tipperary to Waterford City in the east, flanked by the River Suir. 'Republicans control most of the province of Munster. They form an IRA police force and attempt to maintain the railways. The anti-Treatyites are in a position where they're almost running their own kind of, cobbled together state in the first month or so of the Civil War. 'Unlike the national army, the IRA have to feed, equip and supply themselves.' They're often commandeering things like cars and vehicles and bringing them back ponies and traps. Writing out little receipts for cigarettes and fuel. To feed themselves, they might go in and write a little IOU, a little receipt. You know, 'The Irish Republic government will reimburse you at a date to be determined.' 'Such actions strain relationships with the local people most of whom are already under strain after years of war.' Businesses are really uneasy about all this. Unemployment goes through the roof, and the economic cost of this is really apparent to members of the public, who are already experiencing part of a recession. They need money, and one of the things that they do is take over the port of Cork, and they start charging their own customs and tariffs on all the ships arriving there. 'In just five weeks, the IRA raises £100,000 from port trade in Cork. The money generates confidence. If they can establish a functioning Republic in Munster, perhaps they can successfully present a clear alternative to the Anglo Irish Treaty. But first they must rally the strength to overcome the combined forces of the Irish Free State. What emotional charge is carrying those on the anti-treaty side? What are they feeling? Todd Andrews, who was just 19 when this conflict started, who was a very young soldier on the anti-treaty side, when he came to write his memoirs, he wrote of that period: 'I rarely thought. I felt.' This is what they were feeling. This sense that they are carrying on a noble mission and a noble continuity of struggle. 'The National Army's victory in Dublin gives the Irish Free State's provisional government a strong base. Now it is determined to suppress all Republican resistance and build a functioning state. "We fight for the right of the people of Ireland to decide any issue, great or small, that arises in the politics of this country. That right is sacred." 'British propaganda has for decades suggested that the Irish are too violent and disorderly to govern themselves.' The absolute chaos that is unleashed by the opposition to the treaty, by the Civil War, looks really bad. They want to impress upon the former colonial masters or whatever that, 'Look we're telling you were capable of doing this.' '31 year old Michael Collins, Chairman of the provisional government and Commander in Chief of the National Army, believes that his duty is to protect the Free State. If this necessitates fighting the anti-treaty Republicans, then so be it. And yet, Collins and General Richard Mulcahy, having both played key roles in the struggle for independence, remain hopeful they can persuade former comrades in the Republican movement to abandon their armed resistance to the State.' "Every constitutional way is open to them to win the people over to their side, and we will meet them in every way. If they only accept the authority of the government." People like Arthur Griffith, Kevin O'Higgins, who are much more confident that there is an important political and constitutional issue at stake. That democracy, the right of the people, should prevail over what they would see as almost kind of an anarchic or a criminal threat, that the Free State are facing. 'The June General Election has given pro-treaty candidates a clear majority. Despite this mandate, Collins has not yet summoned the new parliament. The Civil War, therefore, has no parliamentary sanction. This is the charge that has been made against Collins. Since there was no parliament in existence in Dublin, there was, in fact, a military dictatorship under Collins. Was that appropriate in a democracy? No, obviously not. Was it necessary in the circumstances? Many people would feel it was. (boots marching) ## 'On the outside of the Civil War, The National Army has just 8,000 men. Though better armed, there are fears they will struggle against the potentially 80,000 men in the anti-Treaty IRA. A major recruitment campaign gets underway, which at its height sees up to 1,000 men enlisted per day.' And you have these recruitment offices set up all over the city. And they flood into the ranks, and you did not have to have any previous service. 'Among new recruits are former IRA men and battle-hardened veterans of the Great War. Others, like Dublin man William Heaney, enlist for the wage and are proud to serve their new State. Uniforms are cobbled together. Arms are supplied by the British government. 'Under pressure of time, not all recruits are of the ideal standard.' "We had to get work out of a disgruntled, undisciplined and cowardly crowd. Sentries were drunk at their posts. A whole garrison was put in the clink for insubordination. So the army was undisciplined and often behaved brutally. And many members of the provisional government were appalled at the way in which the misconduct of the army was tainting their cause. 'With little time for training, the National Army spreads south and west from strongholds in Dublin, the Curragh and Athlone.' Drawing on his First World War and War of Independence experience, General Dalton plans strategically. Emma Dalton, in particular, was imaginative in deciding that there's no point in blasting our way into Cork, Kenmare and other towns or cities. Let's take them by sea. 'Dalton commandeers civilian ships, which will carry thousands of troops. Their orders - attack the Munster republic and defeat the anti-treaty Republicans. (dramatic burst of music) In the first wave of the Civil War, the National Army captures Galway City from the I. R A., as thousands of troops spread across the country by land and sea. When you really think of what is important militarily in terms of dominating Ireland militarily, it is control of Dublin and then to break up the lines of communication between the IRA units in the south, in the southwest and in the northwest. 'In Wexford and Limerick, Sligo and Mayo, National Army troops encountered strong resistance from IRA units. Gun battles flared throughout the country. (GUNSHOTS) 'The spread of war angers the public. Some call on Dáil Éireann to convene immediately to find a solution. On both sides of the treaty divide, there are widespread calls for peace. (WOMAN'S VOICE) 'We declare ourselves not satisfied that such a disastrous fratricidal strife is unavoidable.' 'We request Daál EÉreann to call an armistice.' 'For now, however, this conflict has an unstoppable momentum.' In July, the National Army closes in on Limerick, gateway to the south and west. Control of Limerick is fundamental to the outcome of the Civil War. Liam Lynch is in a dominant position in Limerick City. Lynch, Liam Deasy have 700 battle-hardened veterans of the War of Independence under their command. 'With the main army barracks under their full control, the anti-Treaty forces believe they can achieve a bloodless victory over the National Army in Limerick. When National Army officers ask him for a truce, Liam Lynch grants it. But the National Army uses the truce to build forces and artillery around the city, and after days of talks, they strike. (BOMB BLAST) "The situation has got very serious." "Free State troops have swarmed into the city like bees and occupied practically all the posts we had last week. Casualties reported among our men." 'In the Battle of Limerick, which lasts nine days, 700 IRA volunteers engaged close to 2,000 National Army troops. Eventually, the IRA are overwhelmed by superior firepower and organisation. In retreat, the IRA set the barracks alight. The conflict leaves 22 people, including 11 civilians dead.' 'It was the saddest period in our history. The comrades of yesterday, killing one another. Conditions in Limerick jail were deplorable. Our girls did all they could to help the prisoners.' 'On the same day Limerick falls, Free State forces enter Tipperary and Waterford City.' Lynch's illusory, defensive line has vanished, and the heartland of the Munster republic in Cork and Kerry is exposed to pro-Treaty advance from Limerick. 'The collapse of Limerick stuns Liam Lynch. From now on, there will be no further negotiations. The IRA leadership is in turmoil. Some argue they must abandon conventional tactics and embark on a guerrilla war. Others, including Lynch, argue that a retreat to the hills would demoralise the men and alienate the public further. Ernie O'Malley writes letters criticising his fellow IRA leaders' strategic abilities. Ernie O'Malley is concerned that training is being neglected, that they are not on top of their intelligence efforts. He frequently complains throughout the Civil War about the shortcomings of the republican movement. But that's not the message, of course, that they are promoting publicly, which is very much one of defiance and unity. The moment the Treaty is signed, the propaganda war begins. The Free State administration, and particularly the Catholic Church, the newspapers and so on - very effectively demonise the Republicans, delegitimise them. Irregulars, brigands, irreconcilables. Parasites. It's an othering process. It's powerful language. And it's saying that the respectable people are on the side of the Treaty, and the brigands and irregulars are anti-Treaty. It's demonising the anti-Treaty forces. The goal was to delegitimise the enemy. And that discrediting and delegitimising was really critical, because both sides were claiming to be the inheritors of the revolutionary tradition. Anti-Treaty Republicans also tried to fight a propaganda war. In areas under anti-Treaty IRA control, you have censorship as well and propaganda. So the anti-Treatyites take over the Cork Examiner, so it puts the anti-Treaty spin on war news. Cumann na mBan sets up a propaganda department within Dublin, and people like Sheila Humphreys and Maire Comerford go out and put slogans on the wall before six o'clock in the morning. 'The spirit of Cathal Brugha lives.' 'The Republic will never die.' (seagull cries) 'By late July 1922 Dublin, Galway, Limerick and most of the East and Midlands are firmly under state control. As they abandoned positions, the IRA cut communications, block roads and bridges. Local economies come to a standstill. People fear theirs will be the town or village next to be destroyed. (foreboding music) When National Army troops successfully capture Westport from the sea, they are celebrated by most of the townspeople. 'National forces arrived by sea on Monday night and were received with wild enthusiasm by the people when they landed at the quay.' I think the majority of the population wanted normality. They wanted an end to all this madness and murder and mayhem. You had an overall feeling of deep concern and stress and worry amongst the vast majority of the population. 'With options diminishing, some IRA units decide for themselves to switch to the guerrilla tactics that had served them so well against the British.' (GUNSHOTS) So we have ambushes like Abbeyleix, 28th of July, when a group of the National Army are surprised by a bomb and five soldiers are killed. Ambushing is a tactic we've seen since the War of Independence, and that's because it's one of the few things open to you, because you just don't have the resources or the manpower of the other side. I guess it becomes a bit more controversial when we get into the Irish Civil War, because we've got men who previously fought alongside each other, fighting against each other. Civil wars have long been seen as particularly corrosive and destructive and traumatising to communities, because subjectively experienced, when you're in a civil war, you feel as if you're fighting other members of your community. It's that sense of the horror of recognising oneself in the eyes of one's enemy. I see myself in you. We are part of the same blood. I've seen brothers fighting brothers, fathers fighting sons, even. And I actually saw two brothers, one with an axe and the other with the hammer, trying to attract each other. Well, there was blood everywhere. 'As the violence escalates, the Catholic Church aligns increasingly against the Republicans. What they view is that the lawless nature of Irish society since the War of Independence, is leading people down a bad path. That they have lost their natural deference to authority. The republican movement is really responsible for it and what they need to do is to get the natural order back in place. (urgent music) 'In the final week of July, the conflict moves to a triangle south of Limerick between Bruree, Bruff and Kilmallock. Here, the largest pitched battle of the Irish Civil War will be fought. Kilmallock represents a strong barrier to any Free State advance on the heartland of the Munster republic. 'Republicans move over 1,000 well armed IRA men with Cumann na mBan support, into the surrounding area. (GUNSHOTS, BLASTS, SHOUTGING) 'The National Army attempts to encircle them, but the IRA is well prepared.' The Republicans actually push back pretty well. They capture a couple hundred National Army soldiers. (GUNSHOTS) The incoherence of Civil War reveals itself starkly as the battle unfolds. "Confident of success, as any time forces have met in this area, the enemy ran away." There was this phoney war going on. As a civil war, this was a tame affair compared to the Spanish Civil War or the Finnish Civil War, or the Hungarian Civil War. There was a great reluctance to fight. The difficulty, really, is that as many commanders on both sides report, there are guys who just don't want to fire on their old friends. Republicans were somewhat reluctant to engage the enemy. They weren't taking the offensive often enough. A phrase you often hear in the memoirs and accounts of veterans, is that their heart wasn't in it. "I had not a desire to kill the enemy. The officers who were operating against us were our own former friends." 'IRA volunteers are unpaid. Some are reluctant to operate beyond their home county. Others, frustrated by strategic failures, simply abandoned the fight and go home.' There's no doubt demoralisation set in very early. 'Through several days fighting, the National Army marshals its armoured cars and artillery to good effect, and builds a cordon around Republican positions until the Republicans are forced once more to retreat.' ## 'Kilmallock is the third major defeat for the anti-Treaty side. Across Ireland, thousands of anti-Treaty sympathisers and operatives have been arrested. Just five weeks since the war began, the Republicans are in disarray.' The prisons are overflowing with Republicans, men and women. There is just mass internment, so they're just rounding up people. 'In Northern Ireland, Unionist leader James Craig watches the war in the Irish Free State unfold with interest. Since January, Northern Ireland has experienced its own kind of civil war between nationalists and unionist communities. Hundreds were killed in Belfast alone in the first months of 1922. But the outbreak of civil war in the free state has brought a dramatic change. The Unionist regime is having a very tricky time. If you're in the Belfast government, every day is a crisis. Every day you feel the ice cracking under your feet and what changes that is the outbreak of the Civil War. It meant that the Ulster Unionists were freer to consolidate their regime, especially because the northern IRA largely and overwhelmingly went south. The IRA in the north, most of them joined Free State forces. There is overwhelming support for the treaty in the north, both among the IRA and the broader nationalist population. Because it looks like a solution. It looks like it will resolve something. There's a real desire for peace for some kind of stability. This effectively means that those IRA forces in the north who had been hitherto operating against partition are now to all intents and purposes, decommissioned, taken away from the north and embroiled in the conflict over the future of the treaty and over the future of the provisional government. From Craig's point of view, this is a great break. For Northern Republicans who do stay in Northern Ireland find that their position is really undermined. And Craig's government is in a position to bring in a really draconian suppression of the IRA. So the Irish Civil War also means essentially the collapse of northern Republicanism as a political force for several generations, and that has a traumatic impact on northern Catholics. (MUSIC BUILDS) August the 2nd, 1922. 800 National Army troops approached the North Kerry coastline by sea. Though local IRA men put up a strong defence both Fenit and then Tralee fall to the Free State. Meanwhile, General Dalton moves an even greater naval force towards the South coast. Here, he plans to strike three separate targets at the same time, Youghal, Union Hall and Cork City. From there, the National Army hopes to encircle Republican forces in Munster. But the IRA foresees the naval strategy and barricades the River Lee with mines. The British Navy informed Dalton's Free State landing party about the position of mines in the harbour. (foreboding music) The tip off allows Dalton to change course, and he successfully lands 800 men at Passage West. Dalton's troops easily push aside a small IRA garrison and march towards Cork. Hundreds of IRA rushed from the city in neighbouring battlefronts to stop the Free State advance. Here in Rochestown, the two sides meet and a major battle ensues. (GUNSHTOS) A consistent thread throughout this whole conventional phase is any place the Republicans put up pretty good, stubborn resistance, the Free State just brings in artillery and just blast them out. And that's what happens in Rochestown. Dozens of Free State soldiers are killed and wounded. But again, the Republicans are soon overwhelmed and retreat. On August the 10th, the National Army enters Cork unopposed. The capital of the Munster Republic has fallen. (mournful music) As news of the advance of the National Army arrives in the city, the IRA set fire to the police and military barracks. And it is stated that the city was enveloped in a pall of smoke. It's basically chaos. Anarchy. Locals take advantage of the chaos. Businesses, shops and barracks are looted. I think it's important to understand the extent of poverty in Irish society at the time. You've really got to understand how desperate people are. There's a shortage of bread. There's a shortage of fuel, so looting is very prevalent. ## As the Republicans melt away from the city and into the countryside, the National Army is actually warmly welcomed. In the six weeks since the attack on the Four Courts, the National Army has pushed the IRA out of most of Leinster and Connacht. Now, with most of Munster under Free State control, people feel the conflict must be over. By the middle of August 1922, they controlled practically every town, every urban centre in the country, across the territory of the state. And so the parts that they didn't succeed in getting on top of - places like South Wexford, parts of Kerry, Mayo. These were very much places which didn't have that much strategic importance. So it's a really one sided conflict. And the only reason I'm saying is that it might have been otherwise, is that the greater numbers at the start of the Civil War were with the anti-Treatyites. The fall of Cork City brings the conventional phase of the Irish Civil War to an end. A new, more terrible phase is to come. In the days that follow the taking of Cork, the National Army pushes west as it routs the IRA. We were kept moving from the time we started until we took over every town, every village, every stronghold of the others in the area. ## The anti-Treaty Republicans did not have the resources, the strategy or the public support to be remotely capable of winning the Civil War. In conventional warfare terms, the Civil War is over very quickly. It was seen as quite demoralising for the Republicans, for the IRA, for Cumann na mBan. An unknown story is that maybe between the time the treaty was signed and let's say September 22, many, many people who had been involved in the IRA might have gone home and decided not to fight. There was that process of demobilisation, which was quite spontaneous. And after they put up the fight for Dublin, after they were unable to defend the so-called Munster Republic, many people would have concluded that we cannot win this Civil War. While many more IRA men abandoned the war, thousands vowed to fight on. There is an order by Liam Lynch, the Chief of Staff of the IRA that they go to the mountains and are going to revert to the guerrilla tactics that they used in the War of Independence. They just end up in very remote places. So they end up in the mountains of West Sligo, West Mayo, Conamara, just because these places are inaccessible to Free State soldiers. There's very few roads. So they're living in dugouts in the hills, and a lot of them are just surviving. They were living in culverts and in dugouts and in makeshift old tents. and woods. Desperate conditions - and lice and fleas. And not able to wash and not able to get a proper night's sleep. Cumann na mBan women and some locals try to maintain links and supplies. A column now was four men, short of ammunition, hiding in a dripping dug out. I was a courier now, trying to maintain links. Sometimes I would return to a place and find the unit no longer there. ## Two days after the fall of Cork, Arthur Griffith, founder of Sinn Féin and President of Dáil Éireann, dies of a brain haemorrhage. ## It's hard to get away from the fact that he must have had an extremely stressful job at that point. We forget what was going on politically. From January 22, the provisional government was hard at work, in setting up what would become the Free State. The loss of so influential figure in Ireland's independence struggle shocks the nation. Michael Collins attends the funeral in full uniform. What Collins is portraying is that sense of control. We are in control of this situation. And that perhaps the most high profile individual in Ireland at that time is at the head of a National Army that is fighting for your future. One week after Griffith's funeral, Collins travels by armoured convoy to Cork. Though the risks of travelling in countryside still contested by the IRA are high, Collins is intent on strengthening Free State control over his home county. He is also concerned about the Harbour revenue and the tax revenue that has been diverted by the Republicans, and Collins is there to get that money. Then he decides he's going to make a tour of inspection around West Cork. It's actually pretty reckless. Here, you had probably one of the most important people in the country heading into an area controlled by his adversaries in an open top car that was painted yellow. So on the 22nd of August, Michael Collins drives through the crossroads at Beél na Blaáh. There's a pub there. They asked somebody who came out of the pub for directions to Bandon. What they didn't know was that the person they got directions from was an IRA sentry, who was guarding IRA officers from across Cork, who happened to be having a big meeting at Beél na Blaáh. Inside the pub, the IRA offices are discussing whether to follow Lynch's orders to form flying columns and fight a guerrilla war. Collins, unaware of how close he has come to the IRA leadership, drives away. But the IRA men know that his convoy must return by the same road because they have blown up or blocked nearly every other road in West Cork. The decision is made. Set an ambush and wait for Collins' convoy to return to Béal na Bláth. It's a very interesting site because I've travelled it and you have the main road and parallel to the main road, you've a lane. And the lane overlooks the main road and provides very, very good cover. So it's the perfect location for an ambush. The IRA build a road block on the main road. Sentries cover the blockade from the lane above. They waited for hours. Convoy didn't turn up. They were in the process of moving away when Collins and his men did arrive and a small number of IRA volunteers then opened fire. (BURST OF GUNFIRE) Collins orders the convoy to stop and engage fire. When the IRA rearguard moves to retreat, Collins leaves the cover of his armoured car to get a clear shot from his rifle at the IRA men fleeing up the lane above. General Emmett Dalton was with Collins on that final journey. I thought I heard a voice calling me and I jumped up. And at that stage O'Connell had come up the road to me and he said, 'Where's the Big Fellow?' So I said, 'He's around the corner.' And we both went up there and he had been shot. He was lying there, with a gaping wound in the back of his head. The death of Collins is the great public tragedy of the Civil war. He was the most high profile casualty. He was only 31. Michael Collins' killing sent shockwaves throughout Ireland and beyond. His engaging personality one friendships, even amongst those who first met him as foe. Nearly one in every five people in the country turns up to pay their respects. Whether you were on the pro-Treaty or the anti-Treaty side, you understood that Michael Collins had been such a key figure in getting to where they were at that stage, particularly during the War of Independence. Vast crowds, several hundred thousand strong watch Collins' cortege move through Dublin. At his graveside in Glasnevin, Richard Mulcahy calls for tolerance on all sides. (GUNSHOTS) But Collins's death has hardened hearts within the provisional government. They're living in government buildings, and they're surrounded by a protective core because they were afraid of being assassinated if they moved about. The alarm is about the threat of the social fabric unravelling and some kind of a revolution taking place if things are allowed to disintegrate. There's a lot of fear of revolution getting out of control in this period. The Civil War everyone's talking about is the one that's happening, you know, in Russia and the kinds of violence and atrocities that can come out of the Civil War situation. There's this fear of anarchy. There's this fear of those who the provisional government are kind of depicting into the wild men outside the door, screaming through the door, this kind of sense of everything collapsing and the need for law and order. Inside government buildings, the Cabinet is grimly determined. The Republicans must be overcome. Richard Mulcahy replaces Collins as Commander in Chief of the National Army. W. T. Cosgrave takes over as chairman of the provisional government. But certainly there was a change on the government side. A new toughness, a new impatience, a new intolerance of what was seen as impossible, destructive, malevolent behaviour on the part of the Republicans, that must be fought and fought harshly and, if necessary, brutally. Cosgrave vows that his government will stop at nothing to put an end to the threat to the Irish Free State. I am not going to hesitate. If the country is going to live, and if we have to execute 10,000 Republicans, the three millions of our people are bigger than the 10,000. In the coming months, the Free State government will execute 81 of its citizens in the name of democracy and defence of the new state. National Army soldiers will maim and murder many more. Republicans will counterattack, bringing devastation and terror to communities throughout the island. Once you've crossed the Rubicon, a metaphor that comes from the Roman civil wars, once you crossed the Rubicon, there is no going back. The months ahead will forever darken Ireland's revolutionary struggle and give rise to a legacy of bitterness and shame that will linger for generations. 1922, the signing of The Anglo Irish Treaty, has brought British Rule in the south of Ireland to an end. But The Treaty's terms have split the Irish people. The pro-treaty side argues, that the Irish free states dominion style has within the British Empire may not been perfect, greater independence can be achieved at a later stage. In my opinion it gives us freedom. Not the ultimate freedom, that all nations desire and develop to, but the freedom to achieve it. Those on the anti-treaty side however, believe that The Treaty betrays the Irish Republic, declared in 1916 and 1919. That document makes British Authority our masters in Ireland. Both sides believed passionately in their cause. The government believed we must preserve democracy. And we the government represent democracy, we represent the people. The Republicans believed we represent the true Ireland. The Republic for which people have fought and died. We cannot abandon it. Convinced that they must protect the Republic, anti-treaty Republicans threatened to take up arms against the Irish Free State. They really do feel that this is a moment of change, where they can actually push back using violence and they can actually achieve the Republic. In Northern Ireland, newly established as a polity within the United Kingdom, Unionists and nationalists watch nervously, as the Irish Free State is rocked by civil war. In this era of turmoil, people fear the worst. Consider the finished civil war, the Latvian War of Independence, the Estonian War of Independence. All of these disputed boundaries, after the end of the First World War, The collapse of former empires, the Irish Civil War happens in the midst of that international upheaval. (Explosion) In the war's first weeks, the Free State's National Army, drives the Republicans from cities and towns, leading to a sense that the conflict could soon end. (Explosions) The killing of Michael Collins, chairman of the Provisional Government, brings a new bitterness to the conflict. Once Collins is killed in Beal na mBlath, it's like something just switches off. The brutal violence in the months after Collin's death, darkens the emergence of the Irish Free State. The stance of the provisional government was essentially, 'we're meeting terror with terror.' (Gunshots fire) Late August, 1922, the anti-treaty IRA leadership, considers whether to lend its resistance to The State or embark on a new phase in the war. Well armed and organised, the Provisional Government's National Army has upwards of 55,000 men in its ranks. Including most of the former Dublin IRA, and thousands of First World War veterans. The anti-treaty IRA, routed by the National Army from strong holds across The State, is now on the run, in remote regions in the south and west. They're living with very little supplies. They're depending on the generosity of the locals to feed them, to look out for them. They had to be more careful, I suppose, in terms of who did they trust. They are occasionally doing post office robberies. They're coming down to the towns, and requisitioning supplies from people. Probably making themselves very unpopular. The Republican women's group, Cumann na mBan, strongest in Munster and Connacht, support the IRA with supplies, safe houses, transport and weapons. So, they're a lot more integrated in IRA military operations, then they had been in the War of Independence. And a lot of that, reflected the collapsing state of the IRA organisation. And the loss of a lot of their rank and file. And so Cumann na mBan kind of gladly stepped into that breech. IRA Chief of Staff, Liam Lynch, accepts that his side may never be able to win a conventional war. Instead he issues new orders, use guerilla tactics, and make the country ungovernable. What I hope for is to bring the enemy to bankruptcy. And make it impossible for a single government department to function. Roads and communication systems throughout The State, are bombed and demolished. Ireland's once dense and intricate railway network, comes under constant attack. The use of guerilla tactics by the IRA, enrages the National Army. In one ambush, in Carrigaphooca, Co. Cork, seven soldiers are killed, when and IRA booby trap mine explodes. The anti-Treatyites can pick the time and the place, the soldiers are out doing guard duty. They're on patrol. And there's a feeling I suppose of great dislocation, for many National Army soldiers. that they're in this position, that they're being attacked by fellow Irish men. They think they can kill us with these sneak attacks, where we've no chance to defend ourselves. Well, we can do it too. We can take revenge. Late evening, August 26th, two young men, 19-year-old Sean Cole, and 21-year-old Alfred Collie, both members of the Republican Youth Group, Fianna Eireann, are arrested near Newcomber Bridge, in Dublin City Centre, Sean Cole and Alf Collie were taken off the streets of Dublin and killed. (Gunshots) Their bodies were then found out by Drumcondra. So, you see the reprisal killings starting to happen. Over coming weeks, scores of young Republican men are arrested and killed, in similar circumstances. A number of their bodies are found. Sometimes evidence of them being beaten and so on. Usually shot in the back of the head. There's little doubt, that there were those who were taking the law into their own hands. In mid September, a National Army unit chases and captures 6 IRA volunteers, on the slopes of Benbulbin. The IRA unit is led by Brian MacNeill Son of Eoin MacNeill, Minister for Education in the Provisional Government. Like many families, the MacNeill's have been split by The Treaty. Despite surrendering, young MacNeill and his men are shot dead. Machine guns were used. Some of the bodies were very badly damaged. One was mutilated by a bayonet. Post-mortem. Both sides committed heinous actions, and foul deeds of this nature. But when the government side was involved, it raised questions about the nature of the new state, its leaders, the role of the military, the rule of law and order. The cabinet were aware of what was going on, didn't do a great deal to stop it. To put things in context, one has to remember that the cabinet was fighting a war. Their own men were being shot at every day. The unravelling situation in Ireland, concerns the British Government. There was a feeling that the Irish can't run affairs. Just look at what happens as soon as they're given any sniff of independence. They tear each other apart. Since Collin's death, Chairman of the Provisional Government, W.T. Cosgrave, Minister of Home Affairs, Kevin O'Higgins, and most of the Cabinet, have moved into government buildings, with their wives and their children. They're living in government buildings, and they're surrounded by a protective core. The level of alarm is really enormous. They're all relatively young men. Apart from Cosgrave, no experience of government, And the government had a great deal to do, to keep the hospitals running, and schools open and the economy functioning. And that was the fear driving events, the money would run out. They could not meet the payroll to the army. The Civil Service would unravel. And Britain would send in the troops. Cosgrave was determined to make Ireland, a normal, functioning, democratic society. He and his colleagues felt that the Republicans were trying to drag Ireland back into a bloody past. And it must be stopped. Although, I have always objected to the death penalty, there is no other way that I know of in in which ordered conditions can be restored in this country. In late September, Dail Eireann passes the Public Safety Act, which grants emergency powers to The State. Anyone caught with a gun, that could be used against The State, can be executed. When you mentally, maneuver yourself into that position, you can justify the most drastic actions. And you're not necessarily thinking about how these executions will be viewed in the future. You're thinking about striking the fear of God into your opponents, in order to bring them to their senses. Crucially, the government has broad support to the among pivotal forces in Irish society. Including the Catholic Church. The breaking of road, bridges and railways is criminal destruction. The killing of national soldiers is murder before God. If you look at the Catholic church, during the War of Independence, it's very coy about criticising, or condemning republican violence. Within weeks of the Civil War beginning, they're condemning very explicitly, the anti-treaty Republicans as criminals. In the weeks that follow, the Free State continues its downward spiral. Eamon de Valera, leader of the Republican political wing, forms an underground Government. But its Cabinet is on the run and powerless. Control of the republican side, lies with the IRA Army Council. Whose leaders include Ernie O'Malley, Liam Deasy and Liam Lynch. Despite being on the run, the IRA continues to show strength. In a surprise attack on Clifden, 80 national army soldiers, and a large haul of guns are captured. Three days later, Minister for Defense, Richard Mulcahy's home is bombed. Though his family is safe, Mulcahy is infuriated. People in the Provisional Government were worried, that once the IRA had adopted guerilla tactics, this could go on, forever. In mid November, four young men, James Fisher, John Gaffney, Richard Twohig and Peter Cassidy, are arrested for being in possession of small firearms, and brought to Kilmainham gaol. In a secret trial, with no solicitors to defend them, all four are sentenced to death. "Dear mother, "I'm now awaiting the supreme penalty. "But I'm perfectly happy. "Because I've seen the priest. "And I'm going to die a good Catholic. "And a soldier of the Irish Republic. "Don't worry or cry for me. "Goodbye." He was then aged 18. One young man sent back his mouth organ, and his brother Paddy. That's all he had to leave him. Four men stand before a firing squad. Just yards from where, six years earlier, the leaders of the 1916 rising were shot by the British. (Shots fired) These first official executions, by the Irish Free State, shocked the public. "Writing as strong supporters of The Treaty, "we have the gravest misgivings, "as to the wisdom of inflicting "extreme penalty for the offences disclosed." Six days later, Erskine Childers, a well known writer, and political figure who had participated in The Treaty negotiations, but then became a propagandist for the Republican side, is sentenced to death. Childers is shot by firing squad in Beggar's Bush Barracks. (Shots fired) He was executed for what? In possession of a small automatic, that he got from Mick Collins, as a present. I mean that was a great excuse to execute him. A great man. The IRA leadership responds to these executions, with its own executive order. "The Army Executive, "has decided that any provisional government members, "who voted for the Murder Bill, "are to be shot on sight." Early December, two government TD's, Padraig O'Maille and Sean Hales exit The Ormond Hotel. An IRA unit opens fire. (Shots fired) O'Maille survives. But Hales, dies of his wounds with in the hour. The government retaliates with immediate effect. The government decided on a brutal and savage response. 'We will take out four prisoners and shoot them.' The four that were taken out for execution, in Mountjoy Gaol the very next day, were Liam Mellows, Rory O'Connor, Joe McKelvey and Dick Barrett. Each one was to represent a province of the country. When the Cabinet meets to sanction the executions, only Kevin O'Higgins hesitates. Rory O'Connor was best man at his wedding. "The rest of us waited in silence watching them. "Finally, he said, 'Take them out and shoot them.'" At dawn, the hour men are taken to a yard in Mountjoy Prison, and shot by firing squad. (4 gun shots ring out). I was in the city, and I heard the news boys calling out, that four were executed. I think horror was the first reaction, to the first executions. People got more hardened as time went on. The provisional government is drawing on the reservoirs of support that exist for it. Perhaps those in many parts of the country, that want an end to this conflict, and are prepared through gritted teeth, to tolerate the idea of a state assuming very, very severe powers. The men were never charged with anything. They were never tried for anything. If The State is going to execute people, it must try them for an offence first. And they must be convicted of an offence first. That's all that stands between a democracy and a dictatorship. The Irish Free State is established formally on December the 6th 1922. And yet, save for a small reception in Leinster House, this significant date in Irish history, is virtually ignored. People tended really not to notice the significant change that had taken place. People didn't pay attention because of the fighting that was going on, because of the killing. In the new Dail Eireann, each member must swear an oath to the British sovereign. "I do solemnly swear, "true faith an allegiance, "to the Constitution of the Irish Free State. "And will be faithful to his majesty King George V. "His heirs and successors by law. "In virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and the United Kingdom." Cosgrave and Mulcahy, and the others, they all swore on the holy book to be loyal to the king. That must have been a difficult thing for them. This was seen by Republicans as treason, as treachery, as betrayal. Under The Treaty, the Northern Ireland Government has been given an option to join the new Irish Free State. But within 24 hours, their Prime Minister, James Craig, sends word, Northern Ireland will remain apart. And that means, the birth of Irish independence, is marred by the simultaneous consolidation of the partition of 1920. Britain, however is relieved. Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State are established. Perhaps now they hope, the Irish question has been solved. (gun shots) As winter bites, the conflict worsens. The violence is pervasive. And constant. And people are really living on their nerves. And communities are really traumatised. The IRA continues its campaign of destruction. In protest at the executions, IRA leaders tried to prevent sports and social events taking place. Politicians and their family residences are targeted. Two weeks before Christmas, An IRA unit sets the home of TD Sean McGarry on fire. His seven year old son, Emmet, dies trapped inside. And the IRA attacks the Cosgrave family pub on Dublin's James's Street, President, W.T.'s uncle, Patrick is killed. Chief State solicitor, Michael Corrigan's home, is destroyed by a bomb. I think the animus, sense of real hostility, which marks the latter stages of the war. Begins when the government starts turning the screws. In January 1923, 34 republicans are executed, during that month. In that month also, Liam Deasy is captured, one of the leading republicans. And he calls for an end to the war. He see's the writing on the wall. The national army force is increasing in size. And critically for Deasy, the IRA are losing their legitimacy amongst the community. The economic, dislocation, and disruption is having and enormous effect, on the civilian population. Though the IRA leadership ignores Deasy's ceasefire proposal, privately, Liam Lynch has doubts. "We cannot hope to overthrow the enemy. "Unless there is a big desertion "or complete change of the people to our side." During 1922 and '23, roughly 12,000 Republicans are imprisoned by the Free State. As prisons overflow, makeshift camps and ships are used to incarcerate prisoners. Lice, fleas and vermin are a constant plague. The threat of execution is hanging over them. So, if the Republicans shoot a National Army Soldier, then one of your guys are going to be shot here. So, it's really, it's a whole different level. More than 600 women are also in prison. Among them in Mountjoy Prison, is Cumann na mBan operative, Annie Moore. Who must bear receiving the news, that seven men from her unit have been executed in the Curragh Camp. They include her fiance, Paddy Nolan, who she was due to marry at Christmas. Throughout the system, men and women are often treated harshly. When prisoners refused to cooperate, with the authorities, there was often harsh measures taken against them. So, you have people being beaten. "The men seem skilled. "They had many methods. "Some twisted the girls arms. "Some bent back their thumbs. "Annie McKeown, one of the smallest and youngest, "was pulled downstairs and kicked on the head." In protest at conditions, thousands go on hunger strike. Mary MacSwiney's hunger strike in November 1922, was one of the more significant hunger strikes, during the Civil War, Because of the fact that her brother Terence MacSwiney, had died on hunger strike in 1920. So, her hunger strike was widely reported in the United States, because she was such a well known figure. What did they feel? What emotional charge, is carrying those on the anti-Treaty side during the Civil War? This sense that they are carrying on, a noble mission, and a noble continuity of struggle. Well of course, there are those who are quite prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. They are quite prepared to give their lives. 31 days on hunger strike? 31 days on hunger strike. Did you think you were going to die? Not at all. Well, after about the 14th or 15th day we didn't go around much. We stayed in bed a lot. Conserve the energy and read books. And above all, read any book, that had a lot about food in it. We loved that. The guerilla phase of the Civil War, triggers a rise in agrarian violence. The burning of stately homes, which began during the War of Independence, accelerates during the Civil War. A lot of the landlord classes, they were easy targets. And also, a lot of the large land owners, would have supported the Free State. These families, typically given warning. So, they would often be given, a chance to take out some precious belongings, or paintings or books. Certainly, a terrifying experience. "Oh, those terrible long nights, "when one is waiting to be burnt. "I feel so cold. "It's as if the hearts blood "cease to have any warmth. "I suppose that is the effect of terror." There is a parallel struggle, for land going on. throughout the Irish Revolution. The tenants, they're looking for the land, and burning out landlords. was one way to get rid of landlords who had large holdings. We really get a sense of the impact of this period on southern unionists when we compare the population. If we look at the protestant population of Ireland, in 1911 and compare it to the 1926 census, there's a decline of one third, there's a lot of reasons for that. Clearly, many were leaving by choice. Many of them, were politically loyalists. They didn't want to live in a Catholic state. While clearly others were driven out, by the activity of the IRA. Large farmers and rural businesses are often targeted. That could be houses, businesses. It could be crops. Or by animal maiming and targeting cattle or horses. It's not always clear if they are also Republicans or on the anti-treaty side, or if they're using the situation for their own benefit. So, in a vacuum of law and order, against the background of a deteriorating economy, questions about land and politics, about status, identity, allegiance, religion. They all intermingled. Concerned, that these troubles will undermine the new state, the government forms the Special Infantry Core, An army unit dispatched to break labour strikes and riots, and protect landowners. The Free State will defend private property at all costs. The government believed fully that they had no choice. They had to gun-ho, full on, to wipe this out to finish it off. In the course of the war, the government and army officially executes 81 men. 100 more at least, are executed unofficially. The majority of the executions, take place in areas of the country, where the IRA is most effective. The targets they chose, tended not to be leaders. As the conflict went on, they were executing people, maybe who had no connections, who were very young. That definitely deterred maybe younger activists from becoming involved or maintaining their involvement. The Republicans themselves, they're angered. They're disgusted by it. Eh, but... It's effective. It demoralises them. Spring, 1923. Civil War has by now dissipated, in all but the strongest of Republican heartlands. Mayo, South Wexford and County Kerry, where some of the worst violence in the war takes place. You see a 100 anti-Treatyites ambushing. You see hours long fire fights, with thousands of rounds expended. Which you're not seeing anywhere else in the country. And this terrible frustration, that they're not making headway, that the Civil War won't end in Kerry, probably contributes to the terrible reprisals that happened there in March 1923. The Dublin Guards, the notorious unit of the national army, led by former members of Michael Collin's squad, is sent to Kerry to suppress the IRA. The army in Kerry were increasingly out of control. This came to a head on the 6th of March of '23. Acting on a tip off, National Army troops, drive to Knocknagoshel to search for a weapons dump. When the unit approaches, a booby trap is triggered. 5 of the National Army soldiers are killed. The sole survivor is maimed for life. "Defective vision in both eyes. Scar running diagonally beneath the right eye and the nose. "Scars on the face, double cataract, "both limbs amputated." Commanded by Paddy O'Daly, the Dublin Guards retaliated with immediate effect. 9 Republicans in Ballymullen Barracks are beaten, and then taken to Ballyseedy Cross. 9 0 2 4 take one. We were marched into a lorry. And taken out to Ballyseedy. One of our lads asked to be left to say his prayers. He said, 'No prayers.' He said 'Our fellas didn't get any time for prayers.' They tied us in a circle then around the mine. But he said goodbye then, and I said goodbye and up it went. And I went up with it, of course. "Limbs and flesh with pieces of clothing were found "adhering to trees and strewn along the roads and fields, "over a 100 yards from the explosions." All 9 Republicans are assumed dead. But Stephen Fuller manages to crawl to safety. I met with the ditch anyway. Then they opened machine gun fire as well. Fuller hears the soldiers shoot his comrades bodies, to ensure they have been killed. (machine gun fire) One of the bodies after, had a row of bullets across his chest. 24 hours later, 6 more Republicans are brought to Countess Bridge in Killarney. Where they are tied to a landmine which is detonated. (Explosion) Five days later, at Bahaghs, near Cahersiveen, five more men are blown up in similar circumstances. (Explosion) One of the disturbing features of the reprisals in Ballyseedy is that, Paddy O'Daly who was behind it, was covered for by Richard Mulcahy, the Minister for Defence. O'Daly was asked to resign, He wasn't dismissed from the army. And there wasn't a formal inquiry. Months later, though never formally charged, Free State Officers are also implicated in a brutal assault, on two young women in Kenmare. It is one of just several such assaults against women that occurred during the conflict. There was definitely a taboo around sexual violence. Meaning that it's difficult to access accounts, but we do have a number of very high profile accounts during the civil war, committed by Free State soldiers or by anti-treaty IRA. You can understand why women would never want this to come out in public. But we know at least 9 women who were affected in that way. "A party of men, armed to the teeth, "forced their entrance into our house. "One brute satisfied his duty passion on me. "And as a result, I was dangerous a health and with child." There's gang rapes. Extremely vicious. And there's also a very violent beating of women as well. This kind of violence during the civil war, was often used to purge local communities of families that were considered not to be loyal. Rape, torture, attacks on homes, robbery, murder, executions, acts of brutality perpetrated by Irish people upon Irish people. The methods used by both sides during the guerilla phase of the Civil War, were not easily forgotten. All of this is about a process of escalation. A process of becoming more and more ruthless. More and more hardened. (Explosion) You know, that sense of ruthlessness, in terms of the male use of violence. being normalised through World War One, and through the War of Independence, into the Civil War. (Explosion) It's not like the Civil War sort of drops out of thin air. This is a learned process. With thousands of Republicans abandoning the struggle, and most civic organisations calling for an end to the conflict, Liam Lynch agrees to hold a meeting of the IRA executive near the Waterford, Tipperary border to discuss a ceasefire. But when the National Army learns of the secret meeting, it floods the region with troops. As Lynch and group of senior IRA leaders, retreat through the Knockmealdown Mountains, they are spotted by Free State troops. Soldiers fire on the IRA. Lynch is hit. Lynch's death in many ways, opens the door for some form of ceasefire. Eamon de Valera is emphatic about the need to, in his words, 'shepherd the men back.' To get them out, of militarism. To get them back into employment. Frank Aiken, who replaces Lynch, as IRA Chief of Staff, is convinced that without the public support, the IRA can never win. The Civil War ended when Frank Aiken told the IRA to lay down their arms. It wasn't a truce in the sense of the War of Independence. It wasn't a surrender. It was a ceasefire order. And many of them just put down their guns, and melted away. The Republican political leader, Eamon de Valera, issues a short statement. "Soldiers of the Republic, "Legion of the Rearguard, the Republic can no longer be defended, "successfully by your arms. "Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment, "with those who have destroyed the Republic." The ceasefire brings widespread relief to the people. When a general election is held in August, the Famers' Party wins 12 per cent. Labour, 10 per cent. The pro-Treaty Party, Cumann na nGael, wins 39 per cent, and forms the new government. The election delivers a surprise. Though many activists are in prison, or on the run, the anti-treaty Republican Party, has won 27 per cent of the vote. So, despite the horrors of the Civil War, despite the destruction, despite the sort of reputation they had been given, as people who destroyed the country, they still have a significant minority of the voters, who are willing to support them. The voting patterns, also reveal marked social and geographical distinctions. The more wealth you have, the more property you have, the more established you are, the more likely you are to be pro-Treaty. They less property you have, the further away you are from the centres of power, the more likely you are to be anti-Treaty. The priority now for the new government, is to get the economy and society up and running. After the Civil War, Ireland was impoverished. Battered, divided. And a government by and large of very young men. Were in charge of trying to restore order. trying to rebuild. Plans get under way, to build the Ardnacrusha power station, with German engineering company Siemens. When it opens, the hydro-electricity dam produces enough electricity to meet the states entire needs. Land reform is also quickly enacted. The Minister for Agriculture, Patrick Hogan's 1923 Land Act, effectively led to confiscation of land, that was still in the hands of landlords. So, the new government was not entirely unsympathetic to the position of those who wanted to own the land. Bridges are mended. Cities and towns are slowly rebuilt. In Dublin, the new GPO opens in 1929. The new state, continues most of the legal, administrative and taxation systems, that had operated under the British. The government rapidly demobilizes most of the army. The internal security at the new state, will be managed by the unarmed Garda Siochana. But as The State finds its feet, Republicans discover that they are often blacklisted, and excluded from jobs and opportunities. That was, I think a source of bitterness. The sense that the people who had fought in the revolution, had fought for their countries liberation, found it inhospitable economically, socially, politically, and they left for Boston, New York and Chicago. Many never returned. In 1924, the Boundary Commission meets to examine the issue of Irish border. The signatories of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, had anticipated that the commission would grant to the Irish Free State, those border areas of Northern Ireland, where Catholics were in the majority. But the commission's report in 1925, disappoints Irish Nationalists. The great takeaway really from the Boundary Commission, is that the border stays the same. The fact that they emerge in 1925, still in command of those 6 counties, represents a form of victory for Northern Unionism. As it settles down, James Craig, comes to a very simple view of the world. We do the Protestant thing up here. They do the Catholic thing down there. Simple. Didn't you realise? That's the solution to the Irish question. Now, of course, it wasn't. And if you're the one third Catholic minority, in the North, it is the worst possible outcome for them. Northern Nationalists feel incredibly let down. They don't trust the new Northern Irish State. They don't trust that London will have their interests. And Dublin has abandoned them. And when taken alongside to put it politely, skewed redrawing, a gerrymandered redrawing, of the local government boundaries. This delivers a real set of challenges and issues which weigh heavily upon northern nationalism. These are issues which resonate right down to the 1960s. For the south, the first decade of independence, is fraught and tense. Eamon de Valera consolidates Republican support into a new political party, Fianna Fail. And enters the Dail in 1927. But Fianna Fail deputies face a dilemma. How can they take the oath of allegiance, to the British Sovereign, when this was the primary reason over which they fought the Civil War. So, de Valera consults a moral theologian, who tells him that you can take an oath, and not mean it. You take the oath but you declare it to be an empty formula. A majority of anti-treaty Republicans, come to support Fianna Fail, and its promise to undo the treaty, and enact socially progressive policies. But the IRA has not disarmed. In July 1927, Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins, is assassinated near his home in Dublin's Booterstown, by a rogue IRA unit. Hard line Republicans reject Fianna Fail's constitutionalism and continue to undermine The State. In the general election of 1932, Fianna Fail defeats Cumann na nGael, and forms a government supported by the labour party. The following year, de Valera calls a snap election, and secures an overall majority. "The program of Fianna Fail, "has now been definitely adapted "as the national policy of the Irish people. "That program aims at restoring, the unity o"f Ireland, "and securing its independence." The remarkable thing about this new party is, many of his TD's and a lot its government ministers, are former IRA commanders. Oscar Traynor. Sean Moylan. People who had been actively engaged, in armed conflict. That is a great achievement, particularly in the aftermath of The Civil War, to have a peaceful transfer of power was a great achievement. In response to Fianna Fail's rise to power, and the impact of the economic war, sparked by de Valera's refusal to pay land annuities to Britain, a right wing, pro-treaty organisation, known as 'The Blue Shirts,' grows in strength. There leadership, Eoin O'Duffy and others, certainly embraces a lot of the fascist ideology current in Europe at that time. They adopt the fascist salute. They were directly opposed to Fianna Fail. And also, to the communists. Also, to the IRA. Blue Shirts and IRA clashed regularly. Prompting fears of a resurgence of civil war. Fianna Fail moves to suppress the Blue Shirts. And in 1933, Blue Shirt members merge with Cumann na nGael and the centre party, to form a new political party, Fianna Gael. For the next seven decades, these two bitterly opposed parties, the anti-Treaty Fianna Fail, and the pro-Treaty Fianna Gael, will remain steadfast political enemies and dominate Irish politics. The Fianna Fail Government ultimately moves to suppress former allies in the Republican movement, when it bans the IRA in 1936. The radicalism that once fuelled the revolution, is eclipsed by a conservative pragmatism. People were not actually looking for a revolutionary Ireland. They had a revolution to have in Ireland. But the Ireland they wanted wasn't a revolutionary one. The women are the big losers in the new Ireland. Within two years of the Free State coming into existence, The Free State Government begin to chip away at the rights of women. They start with the Juries Act in 1924. The first thing that the Free State does, basically is saying women will not be tried by their peers, because it will be an all male system. The French socialist Fourier says that you can judge the degree of equality within a society, by using the position of women as a yard stick. Right across the board, women are relegated to second class citizenship, both the pro and anti-Treaty sides were pretty much united on this, if very little else. In the decades following the famine of the 1840s, the Irish Catholic Church had extended its influence on Irish Society. Running schools, hospitals and institutions across the country. Now, in the new Free State, politicians of all sides are deferential to all sides. So, the church can throw it's weight against divorce, against contraception, in favour of censorship and so on. But these were not deeply unpopular measures, imposed by the church on unwilling people. These were measures that most Irish people felt were good and wholesome and healthy. Ireland was a conservative country. We can highlight all sorts of failings, in relation to the vacuum that appears as a result of the Civil War into which the Catholic Church is very quick to move. And we could look how power was used and abused, and the network of alliances that are built up. The reliance on institutions, the determination to hide, and deny rather than confront many Irish social difficulties. But there is also a huge advantage to stability. It's the survival of democracy. At a time, when democracy is under very severe pressure, when Europe is inching towards a second World War, Ireland retains its democracy. Throughout the 1930s, de Valera and his Fianna Fail party, continue to dismantle the Anglo-Irish Treaty, from within Dail Eireann. Now deputies, who had once fought each other with guns, debate in an uneasy peace. (Hitler speaking in German) As Fascism threatens Europe, de Valera writes a new constitution. It contains no oath to the British crown. And though Northern Ireland remains in the United Kingdom, the Constitution claims the whole island on 32 counties as its territory. Britain, eager to insure that its western flank is secure, turns as blind eye, as the newly named Ireland, Eire, as Gaeilge, asserts its independence. That proved that, under The Treaty, Ireland had the power to do that, as Collins had always said. Two year later, when war breaks out, de Valera announces that Ireland will remain neutral. The country finally starts to unify, during the Second World War. That brings out a national unity that hadn't been there before. De Valera and Cosgrave appear together. Fianna Gael and Fianna Fail, politicians who had fought each other quite bitterly in the Civil War, appear on public platforms. (British Announcer) 408 year after Henry VIII was crowned the King of Ireland, Eire cuts its last link with Britain. Four years after the wars end, on April 19th 1949, the 33rd anniversary of the Easter Rising, Ireland is at last declared a Republic. (British announcer) So comes into being, the world's youngest Republic. An estimated 1,600 people, including 500 IRA combatants, 800 national army soldiers and 300 civilians, were killed in the Irish Civil War. while the names of the dead are mostly forgotten, the war scars the Irish psyche for generations. Some on the anti-Treaty side, are never able to come to terms with what has happened. And in some parts of the country, you know, particularly Kerry, there's a horrendous level of bitterness from all of this. Many were carrying an internal trauma, as a result of these intimate killings. Of the inflicting of great damage. They do suffer from mental torment. Sometimes the answer was not to talk about it. Is there any other episode during the Civil War, that you'd like to tell us about? No, I haven't thought about it. Yeah, OK. There were hundreds of things. But I just haven't thought about it. What's your most vivid memory of The Civil War? God, I couldn't think of it now at the moment. I think silence allows people to function, to move on. For example, Sean Lemass, a future Taoiseach of the country. His brother, Noel, was tortured and killed in the Dublin mountains. But Sean Lemass, makes a very conscious decision, at a very early stage, to park what happened for the sake of his politics and the country. "Terrible things were done by both sides. "I prefer not to talk about it." Of all the achievements in moderrn Ireland, I think, that's probably the best one. That hatred was buried. In the generation kind of before ours really, our parents generation in particular. The southern Irish State, is the only European country formed in the tumultuous aftermath of the First World War, to remain a stable democracy in the century that followed. Though social inequality, remains a persistent problem, The State eventually over came the economic backwardness, that characterised its early decades. In Northern Ireland, simmering tensions caused by a legacy of discrimination, exploded in the late 1960s. Heralding a quarter of a century of violence and terror, that occasionally threatened the stability of the entire island. Peace was achieved in 1998, with the Good Friday Agreement. Ever since, both sides, have strived and struggled, to share power. Power sharing of a sort, also came to the Republic. In 2020, almost a century after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Fianna Fail and Fianna Gael formed a coalition government with the Green Party. The animosities of the Civil War are at last, being consigned to history. The Civil War did not fundamentally divide, the society, it divided the independence movement. The society itself was quite robust. After the Civil War ended, society was able to regroup and find a new centre of gravity. Ireland did despite serious disadvantages, poverty, partition, Ireland did establish a functioning democracy. There was and is quite a lot to be proud of. # (Theme music)
