I abhor nature. I detest her because I know her well. I abhor nature. I detest her because I know her well. Aware of her frightful secrets I have fallen back on myself and I have fell. I have experienced a kind of pleasure in copying her foul deeds. I abhor nature... I abhor nature... I abhor nature. I detest her because I know her well. I detest her because I know her well. Deep in my heart a secret voice cries out saying that for me all this happiness is but a shadow which will vanish like the flower which blooms and withers in the space of a single day. therefore do not accuse me of being capricious, nor say that I am growing cold or indifferent this year. Oh you... Oh you, whose only crime is to love me over my... Oh you, whose only crime is to love me over my... Madame Champville, was a tall woman, slender, well made, having the most voluptuous quality in her look and bearing. A faithful devotee of Sappho she had that kind of expression, even in her slightest movement, in her simplest gestures, in her least words. She had ruined herself for the sake of keeping girls and had it not been for this predilection to which she'd generally sacrificed everything she was able to earn abroad, she might have been comfortably well to do. For a long time she had been in public service, and in recent years had been making her way as an outfitter in her turn, but had confined herself to a limited practice, her clients being reliable rakehells of a certain age. Never did she receive young men and this prudent conduct was lucrative and did something to improve her affairs. Her eyes were so exceedingly attractive, blue and they still fresh. Missing no teeth as yet, she was flat chested but had a belly which was good, but had never aroused envy. Her mound was rather prominent and her clitoris protruded 3 inches when well warmed. Tickle this part of her and one would certainly see her fly into ecstasy in no time, and especially if the service were rendered by a female. Oh you, whose only crime is to love me over my... Her ass was very flabby and worn from use, entirely soft, wrinkled, withered, and so toughened by the libidinous customs she, in recounting her history, will explain to us. that one could do anything one wished without her feeling anything here. One strange and assuredly very rare thing, above all in Paris, she was as much a maid on this side as a girl emerging from a convent, and perhaps had it not been for the accursed part she put into use and put to use with people who cared for nothing but the extraordinary and whom, consequently, that side pleased, perhaps, I say, had it not been for that part, this singular virginity might have perished with her.

Tickle this part of her and one would certainly see her fly into ecstasy in no time, and especially if the service were rendered by a female. My own guilt is an excess of sensibility, an unfortunate tendency to see things in the most sinister light possible, the cruel result of my reversals of fortune. Disgust with life becomes so strong in the soul that there is not a single man who would want to live again even if such an offer were made on the day of his death. Speak... Speak! Disgust with life becomes so strong in the soul that there is not a single man who would want to live again even if such an offer were made on the day of his death. Get up! You son of a bitch! Get up! Oh, Monsieur, a fatal hand has guided my blow. The poor young uttered a piercing cry and fell to the floor. I straight away lighted my candle and bent over her. Merciful heaven, I had struck her in the heart. she was dying. I threw myself on the bloody body.

Imperious, choleric, irascible, extreme in everything, with a dissolute imagination, the like of which has never been seen, atheistic to the point of fanaticism, there you have me in a nutshell and kill me again or take me as I am for I shall not change. ..for I shall never change.
