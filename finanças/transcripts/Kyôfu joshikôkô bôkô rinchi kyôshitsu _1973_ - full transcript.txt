We still have plenty of time. What's the matter? Terrifying, isn't it? You keep losing blood. - Stop! - Get her! Let go! You scum! We'll write it up as an accident. Don't worry, Vice Principal.

Directed by NORI FUMI SUZUKI by offering them your warm friendship. Hey, this is my car. - I know. - Okay then. Then why don't you get out? Shut up! I'm in a hurry. Get out of my way. I'm in a hurry too. Please get out. I said, ''Get out.'' All right. If you want your car back, come get it at the School of Hope. Hey, you! Who the hell are you? I'm Hatano from the juvenile department. What's your name? I ain't talking to a cop. If you want to know, ask Probation. Hey, you! Shut up, scumbag! Settle down! Let me go! You're under arrest! - Hey! - What do you think you're doing? - What kind of greeting is that? - I've never seen this broad before. You looking for a hole in the head? What the hell? Hey, you! Show some respect. Don't underestimate Razor-blade Remi. You there! Stop it! Shit! Let's split! Hey, lady. You don't think you're getting a free ride, do you? When we get there, I'd like to ride you. You're a big talker. Let's see what you've got. Hey, what are you doing? In thanks for the ride, I'll make you blow your wad. Are you turning down my offer? Calling all disciplinary committee members. All committee members assemble in the hallway. PRI NCI PAL'S OFFICE Which one of you is Remi Kitano? Answer! I am. You're being transferred from Takasaki School for Girls. You've been busted five times. Next, we have Kyoko Kubo. That's me. You're transferring from Osaka School for Girls. You've been busted seven times. Seven times? Wasn't it eight times? Shut your trap! I'm so sorry. You must be Noriko Kazama. You're a dropout from St. Mary's in Yokohama. You've been busted four times. You're on probation for assault and battery. You've already disgraced our school just as soon as you got to town. Listen up. I'll let you in on what people call this school. They call our School of Hope a cemetery for delinquent girls. Disciplinary Committee! I'm handing these three transfers over to you. - It'll be your job to discipline them. - Yes, sir. SCHOOL OF HOPE DORMITORY Toshie, Yumi, Hiroko, search their bags. - What you doing to my stuff? - Shut up! Sorry, but those are the rules. That's absurd! What the hell are you doing? Cut it out! - Stop it, already! - Let me go! It's not like you have a lot of cash. Let them do what they want. These are yours? - We're confiscating them. - Do what you like. Shut your cheeky trap! You wearing ones like that under your skirt? - What if I am? - Take them off. You take yours off too. Take it all off. What's wrong with not wearing panties? You think we can count on those three? I don't know. That Noriko Kazama's got guts. That's true. But even that wild Michiyo got snuffed out. It's a deadly business to pull off a coup here. Tomoko. What makes a girl like you want to study in this zoo? I'm in the Sato Scholarship program. I have to do my best. Oh, right, that scholarship program. It's just a fraudulent program to trick the voters. That's not true. Mr. Sato is a respectable politician who understands the needs of the people. You're a lesbian, aren't you? What did you say? You can't fool me. Every gangster girl in Osaka calls me Sappho on the street. Shut your mouth! This shower is for exclusive use of committee members. Next time you use it, you'll be punished. What's the big deal? The school pays for the water. What are you doing? Here you go. She was using the committee's shower. - This is where you bathe. - Think you're a big shot? You don't deserve to use it. It's time to perform a sex check. Yumi, go get the other girl. - What the hell is a sex check? - What's not to understand? We check your box. Spread your legs. Go on! Spread eagle right now! Hurry up and do it. You go both ways. I only do guys to wash out the aftertaste. Have sex with me once, and I'll drive you insane. - You wanna try? - Shut up. You're next. Didn't you hear me? Unfortunately, I'm not into that. If you insist, I'd like the vice principal to do it. What did you say? Ouch! Let go. Let go! Ever since I was a kid, I've hated taking baths. Don't get uptight. It's just a sex check. You piece of shit. You guys are asking for it. - Beat her up! - We're not kidding around. - Get her! - Come on! Stop it, or you'll all be punished. Stop. You can't expect them to learn the rules all at once. If they're still rebellious after a week, do as the committee sees fit. Understand? Now listen up, you three. Obey if you want to graduate in one piece. That would be the smart thing to do. Understand? DISCI PLI NARY COMMITTEE MEETI NG DO NOT ENTER Enough on this topic. We'll now distribute the special scholarship funds for this month. Vice Principal, it's less than usual. And rightly so. Michiyo Akiyama's fatal accident occurred last month. No one ordered you to kill her. I thought I'd taught you well how to treat rebellious students: let them neither live nor die. The incident was an error on your part. In order to have the case settled as an accident, we had to make arrangements with the police, and that cost money. That money has been deducted from your payment. The anniversary of the school's founding is just around the corner. And in preparation for Chairman Sato's election, he'll be paying us a visit soon. If anything should happen at this crucial time, it'll be my responsibility. I'm counting on all of you. That will be all. I'd like to discuss our wedding plans. Let's discuss it after the school's anniversary is past. - You're cold-hearted. - Listen. You and I will soon assume sole control of this school. With your parents' wealth and with my brains, we can do it. Until then, do exactly as I tell you. I understand. It's all for our happiness. Vice Principal. What's this all of a sudden? This spare change is hardly worth my while. Don't you worry. This is just for you. You're the best. I expect you to work hard. Sure, in more ways than one. It's all gone. Boss, can we handle this tab? This club is financed by Vice Principal Ishihara. It's all taken care of, so go ahead and drink up. You're his favorite. His favorite, huh? I envy you. Are you all students from the school? Yes. What do you know about the death of Michiyo Akiyama? I want to know the details. I'll pay for good information. You a professional blackmailer? I'd rather be called a journalist. I'm not like you punks. What's that? I don't know who you are, but if you value your life, I wouldn't go snooping around. The reason you're all so touchy must be that you were involved in the death of Michiyo Akiyama. - What? - You want me to kick you in the nuts? You piece of shit. - Please wait. - Please stop. If you get violent, I'll report you to Mr. Ishihara. Butt out, old hag! Sir, this way, please. Please sit down. I see. Just as I've heard, those students are troublemakers. It won't do any good to dig up dirt about that school. They've paid off the city and the police. You don't stand a chance against the vice principal's corruption. Madam, why are you telling me this? Ishihara is your patron, right? Well, you've done your homework. I guess I have. He doesn't treat women as people, we're just his property. He uses us for advancement and moneymaking. Ever since he got engaged to a woman from a wealthy family, he won't even look at me. And I also hear he's involved with that student. Madam, have a drink. Let me know when you need more. I'm leaving. 1 0,000 YEN I'm coming every night until you say yes. Aren't you smooth? Watch out, you might make me fall for you. I've already fallen for you. - Excuse me. - What do you want? I'm Tomoko Nishida from class 2B. I've got something to tell you. You're all right. Go on. I caught a glimpse of it when they searched your bags. You had a pendant with a cross on it. You mean this? Yes. What about it? How did you get that? It belonged to the late Michiyo Akiyama. You knew her, didn't you? Why do you have it? Michiyo helped me when I was getting bullied by the Disciplinary Committee. She handed it to me one day and said that if anything were to happen to her, she wanted me to give the cross to Noriko Kazama. She said that Noriko Kazama had the exact same pendant. She died three days later. Thank you. It's in my hands now. You're from Yokohama, aren't you? So you're the one the Shinjuku girl gangs could never lay a hand on... the Boss with the Cross. I've heard that name too. Yeah, I'm the Boss with the Cross from Yokohama. That dead girl, Michiyo, was my right arm. She was talented and had the strongest heart. She wasn't one to be killed easily. She must have been tortured. Looks like you're eager for revenge. We'll help you. - You'll be the boss here. - That's right. What the hell do you want? Boss, we overheard your story. I'm Junko theJacker from Shizuoka. I'm from the Yamaguchi girl gang. I'm Nobue, the Pipe Basher. Count me in. Do you guys realize who we're up against? Our enemy is the school itself. Are you ready to put your lives on the line? We're definitely ready. This should be fun. A real worthy challenge. What are you doing? I like you and I want you. Stop it! I'm on the disciplinary committee. Don't. But I like you. I like you and I want you. Toshie, call me Big Sis. Big Sis. You wouldn't lie to your Big Sis, would you? Big Sis. Big Sis. Tell me. Michiyo Akiyama was killed, right? Who killed her? Can't say. - Tell me. - I can't. Don't stop. Bring me to ecstasy. Promise that you'll tell me everything. - Was it the disciplinary committee? - Yes. Where did they do it? In the science lab. Just as I thought. Damn that Yoko. She huffs and puffs like a Boss, but she's just a teacher's pet. She even offs people. Boss, you'll have to shake up the School of Hope and beat Yoko down. Okay, let's do it. Let's do it. First, we'll lay out the facts of Michiyo's death in front of them all. We'll investigate the disciplinary committee and the school. Got it. Hey, not so fast. You're not going to beat them that way. Wouldn't it be better to catch them off guard? Who the hell are you? A guy who wants to bring that school down for reasons of my own. So what do you say? You want to join forces? We could make a much bigger impact. No, thanks. We'll do it ourselves. Call me if you change your mind. I'll be waiting. That's 1 0,000 yen. Let's continue our talk from last week in an open discussion on the subject of love and friendship. Teacher, there's a matter of some urgency. What is it, Miss Kazama? The truth regarding the death of Michiyo Akiyama. I believe our class should discuss it in detail. Let's hear it for that! The truth is that it was ruled an accident. It wasn't an accident. It was a lynching. You're full of it. What proof have you got? - We got the whole story. - That's right. Someone gave us the lowdown. It took place in the science lab. I heard it was torture worthy of a vampire. That's a lie. She's making it up. Take them out. Extreme punishment is in order. - Stop it! - Shut up! - Hey, stop it. - Stop! Principal, please. Let us reinvestigate the death of Michiyo Akiyama. Calm down. The police ruled it an accident. We shouldn't question their judgment. As a member of the disciplinary committee, you must be aware of the severe punishment for betraying us. Prepare yourself. You betrayed us for a lesbian. Now you can enjoy this. Toshie, you must've been hard up for it. Stop struggling. The lightbulb will burst. All right, give me 50 push-ups. Hurry up! One, two, three, four. Do it 50 times, and I'll let you go. Listen, if you lower your hips any more, the light bulb will burst inside you and your box will be a real mess. 21 , 22... I NTROSPECTION ROOM This zoo is right up there with Abashiri Prison. Three days with no food and water. Boss, we'd have to bring in the military to squash this zoo. The military would squash us. Shh. Junko. Tomoko and I will take turns bringing you something every day. - Hey, get in here! - Let me go! Junko, I'll give you a taste of torture... a new method. Here, drink lots of water. I'm not letting you go to the bathroom. Wet yourself in front of us all. I'm not letting you go to the bathroom. Wet yourself in front of us all. In front of us all. ''Detaching yourself from life will not lead to happiness. But then again, if life becomes mere existence, we surely cannot say that we've found happiness. A happy life is feeling good about being alive. Happiness is feeling the beauty of life. What's good and beautiful will lead to happiness. According to the ancient Greeks, the reason we wish for happiness is our longing for goodness and beauty, the simple act of return and success. Socrates said, 'Rather than merely existing, one must live a good life.' And to live a good life...'' What's this? Be quiet! How disgusting! Teacher, she peed her pants. It stinks and it's foul. What a disgrace! Wetting your pants! Yes, come in. Principal, please come at once. The honor of our school is at stake. The honor of our school? Where are you taking me? Principal, if this goes on, you may have to resign. Resign? MOTEL SHARON - What are you doing? - The principal has arrived. - What kind of a place is this? - Aren't you excited? What's this all about? This is no place for pure-hearted high school girls like you. Never mind that and get undressed, old man. Ladies, ladies, all of you. Stop! Stop it! Just take it off. The big crisis involving the school's honor is about to begin. Hey, hey, hey. Stop. He's also going gray down here. Stop! Stop it! Hey, hey, hey. Stop it! Don't stop! Check out how hard he is. He's hard. Put the rubber band right here. You can rub on it all you want now, and it won't shrink. - Nobue, you go first. - Okay. Here we go. Go, go, go, go. Back and forth, and back and forth. Left, right and sideways. Nobue, it's Junko's turn. Forget all unpleasant things. I'm in heaven! Paradise! This has been my recurring dream for the last 50 years. Who cares if I never receive a medal from the ministry of education! Who needs it! I've always wanted to do it with high school girls. This is heaven! Your uniforms turn me on! All students of the school, it has been decided, due to his contribution to the world of education that Principal Nakata will be honored by the Minister of Education. Listen to his cheerful greeting. I've always wanted to do it with girls in uniform. Sucking on your pretty boobs underneath your uniform has been my dream. For over 50 years. I've dreamt of this countless times. I've dreamt of this countless times. I don't want a medal. Just once- Yes, I understand. As you say. Yes. Principal. I mean, Mr. Nakata. By direct order from the Chairman, you have been dismissed for a breach of discipline. From this day on, I will be acting principal. Get out, you old geezer. Looking off,so far away I'm grateful for the kindness of my teacher Even in the garden oflearning The years fly by Bringing back memories Of these past months and years This is the time for farewell Time to say farewell Time to say farewell CLASS 3A What do you want? - Who are you? - I've got bigger fish to fry. Get out! Leave! Ladies. Please excuse me for this unexpected greeting from the podium. For a certain reason, I've come to greet Noriko the Cross in person. I was born and raised in the Kanto area. I was born in Sakura Josui. I grew up among the neon lights of Shinjuku where Osamu Dazai bid farewell to the world. I've been in and out of juvenile hall. Presently, I run 38 gangs of delinquent girls in the Kanto Chapter. My name is Maki Takigawa. I'm here to ask you to accept a one-on-one duel. Let me return the greeting. I was born in Isezaki in the port town of Yokohama. I was raised in a mission. I've been through 1 4 schools during my career as a student. I'm the Cross that makes grown men weep, and I've chosen the life of a gangster. They call me Noriko the Cross. Your personal greeting is accepted. I've looked hard for you. Come with me. I don't care if you're the head of the Kanto Chapter. How dare you come into our territory and talk trash! If you've got a problem, it'll have to wait until I've settled my score with Noriko. Let's go. I have a favor to ask. I'm not going to run or hide, just give me a little time. You've gotta be kidding. You must have known that I'd come looking for you. Are you telling me that after all this time, you're scared of me? - No, that's not it. - What is it then? Do you remember Michiyo Akiyama? Michiyo? The girl who was your lieutenant? I know she was a good lieutenant. Michiyo was killed at the School of Hope. Are you here for revenge? I need to settle that first. I just need five days. All right, but on one condition. Come. Get on this motorcycle and jump those oil drums. If you succeed, I'll wait. What's it gonna be? Just as I expected, Boss with the Cross. Will you keep your word? Fine. I'll be back in five days. Go ahead and get your revenge. You've got skills. I'm leaving now. I can't wait to see your little cat fight. I might make more money than Tom Jones. Why do you keep following me? They've replaced the principal at the School of Hope. It's all coming to a head. Are you still interested in helping us? Damn right. We have the same objective. Hop in. Let us toast our new Principal Ishihara. Cheers. Congratulations. Mayor, you can't have her all to yourself!. What are you saying? The police chief can't be involved with women. You must understand that I'm merely human. When I take off this uniform, I'm just another man. That's right. The lewdest of them all. How would you know, you peon! Are you really going to do it? I'm going to take 1 0,000 from each of them. I'm counting on you. Okay, but I won't let you sleep tonight. I'm well aware. Osone, you'll be the next vice principal. Well, I'll do my best. - What? An orgy? - Yeah. If you'd all like to experience it. To top it off, they're all college girls. Sounds like a great idea. - What do you say, everyone? - Um... That would be inexcusable. Paying for sex is against the law. Weren't you the one who just said you're merely a man? Well, that's true. - Let's go. - Yeah, let's go. The rules are that you have to wear blindfolds. Please put the blindfolds on. Wear these? Thank you for your patience. Be careful and watch your step. Are you all right? You're all right. Now remove your blindfolds. They're in uniform. Yes, we've catered to your fetish for girls in uniform. Please enjoy these young bodies. - Thank you. - Ready, set, go. She's so cute. They're in uniform. Uniforms. School uniforms. Uniforms. Very good. This is a classroom. Ouch. Don't use violence. Hey, you! Run! Hurry up and go. Hurry up. You idiot! Serves you right! Did you see them? What a mess! You were set up. This wouldn't have happened if you weren't all so lewd. How can you say that? You're the one who urged us to go. Tomorrow, the chairman pays his visit. If he finds out, we're finished. We tried our best to identify this guy. He graduated from a top tier college and joined the police. Two years later, he was let go for disciplinary reasons. After that, he became a tabloid reporter on politicians and celebrities. He works behind the scenes and blackmails people. I wonder if he's targeting Mr. Sato. Where is Wakabayashi hiding? - Where did you hide the film? - Spit it out! Wait a minute. These punks don't know anything. We might get better results by leaning on Noriko. We'll draw those three in by torturing these girls. Let's try something new today. Do you have any good ideas? The American military used this method in Vietnam. Let's play with a little electricity. After we apply a charge to their nipples, we'll tie the other line to their pubic hair. Wait. So this is the science lab where you tortured Michiyo to her death. Those who don't follow the rules will be punished. That's the rule. Is that so? Then we'll reciprocate with some punishment of our own. We'll also show you how empty your rules are. - What? - You scum! Kazama, Kubo and Kitano. - We're taking you to headquarters. - What do you want? You guys have a warrant? This is your warrant! Damn it! Wearing a badge doesn't give you the right. Some disciplinary committee. Can't do anything without the aid of the police and the teachers. Is that so? I'll give you a taste of how the disciplinary committee settles things. Strip them down and tie them up. Cut it out! No need to lay your filthy hands on me. Boil me or broil me. Do what you please. I, Noriko the Cross, am not the ordinary kind of victim you're used to preying upon. Officer, let us take care of this situation. I suppose problems on campus are yours to settle. We'll let you handle it. Stay out of trouble. Miss Nozaka, I'm counting on you. WI LL THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BE DISMANTLED SOON? SHIGERU SATO There's a rumor that the assembly will be dissolved soon. I can't offer any comments. I plan to relay my opinion to the prime minister in the near future. Will you run in the next election? If that's what the people want. What is the purpose of this visit? I'm chairman of the board at this School of Hope. It's quite ordinary for a man who has dedicated his life to education to visit this school at every opportunity. Mr. Naba. How many years have you been the mayor? For eight years over two terms. Eight years? It's about time to think about your next post. I'd be delighted. I've been chief of police for 1 0 years and seven months. Chairman, these are this year's class photos. Who's this girl? That's Tomoko Nishida. She's in the Sato Scholarship Program. She's quite earnest and receives good grades. SATO ''The Emperor is the symbol ofJapan. He is also the symbol of theJapanese people. This status of supreme sovereignty is based upon the unanimous consent of theJapanese people.'' Do as he says, got it? - Ishihara, is that you? - Yes. I've brought her. Leave her with me. Come, come. Tomoko, are you familiar with the Compendium of Laws? - Yes. - Try reading a bit. What does it say? ''Chapter Two, The Abandonment of War. Chapter Nine. Based on peace and justice, the people ofJapan will sincerely make world peace a priority. The invocation of' - Please stop! I'm abandoning war by giving up my arms. Stop! Please stop. Stop. Here we go. Stop. Please stop. Mother, mother, mother. RAPE - EXTENDED PRISON TERM Sir. What is it? There's someone here to see you. You idiot, why didn't you send them away? I tried to send them away, but they said your career could be at stake. Introduce yourself. I'm not worthy of an introduction. I'm nobody important. Let me warn you that all I have to do is yell for my aides to come flying in, and the police are on security duty here. I'll give you five minutes. What is it you want? Mr. Sato, your political career is hanging by a thread. - What did you say? - 50 million in cash. That should keep you safe. Ludicrous! Are you insane? What are these? If those get released, the political foundation that has supported you will collapse. 50 million is not a bad price. Are you threatening me? It's not a threat. I'm just a salesman offering you a good deal. If you refuse, arrangements have been made for the negatives to be delivered to the opposition party. Stop kidding around! A man of my stature will not be blackmailed by a punk like you. All I have to do is lift my finger and the city police will act. The head of the Kanto Yakuza Group is also under my thumb. One phone call is all it will take to change your fate. You think you can get away with this? Don't you value your life? I'll take the money over my life. All right. Well, then, have 50 million ready by 1 0:00 tomorrow morning. Fine. Hey, Takeshita. Call Ishihara right away. - Right away. - Ouch, this is hot. You're here right on time. For you to call me so early, it must be something important. It's important for both of us. Your rival, Noriko the Cross, is being held captive at the school. I need you to help her. Why don't you help her? I've got troubles of my own. I'm in the midst of a big job. I'm guessing that they have her in the science lab. I'm counting on you. He thinks he's so cool. What the hell do you want? - Maki. - Don't feel like you owe me one. I can't let you die until I'm done with you. Somebody help! Look at this! HOPE - SHIGERU SATO GOOD-BYE, TOMOKO Tomoko was always so vibrant. Look at her now. This school is deranged! Even our brilliant chairman is nothing but a beast! And all our teachers are his partners in crime. We've got to do something. But how will we fight back? What can we possibly do? We may be weak as individuals, but if we all pull together, we can do something. That's right! - What's so deranged about this school? - Let's hear it. Spit it out! Let me tell you precisely. This school is a bona fide zoo. Starting with the chairman all the way down the line, you're all vampires. Shut up! You're only a student. Noriko, you girls are all going to the police as witnesses to Tomoko's death, caused by her own neurosis. Don't get smart with me, peon. Yoko, today will be the day I get my revenge for Michiyo's death. Just you and me. Come on! Idiots! Where do you think you are? - This is a hallowed classroom. - Shut up! - Shut up! - Stop your blather. You're all coming down to the station. - Come on. - You shut up! Stop. Get her, Noriko. I won't let anyone get in the way. Honey, the chairman is on the phone. What? Michiko, please go to the chairman's house at once. - Me? - Yes. No matter what happens, we must make it through the school's anniversary. Mr. Chairman, please wait a little while longer. I'm being blackmailed for 50 million as a result of Ishihara's carelessness. I want to make that clear before the ceremony begins. This means that after just three days, his term as principal is over. - Let's go. - Please wait. What are you doing, Ms. Mishima? It is a wife's duty to clean up her husband's mess. What? Red on a white background TheJapanese flag is dyed How beautiful they are Michiko's legs - Don't you like it? - Please stop. Michiko, oh, Michiko. You're going to be my dog. You're wet. Nice and damp. It almost looks like rain tomorrow. Aren't my techniques good? It's hot. With this one body, I've gotta get my 50 million worth of fun. Ouch, ouch, ouch. Excuse the intrusion, but I'm here to collect my 50 million. And who are these women? We're honor students from your school. Ms. Michiko, I hope you're not going to lecture us from that position. If you don't pull out, we'll have to take you both. We only have a beef with you. All I want is the 50 million. Mr. Sato, thanks for the dough! 25TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE CEREMONY Chief, you still haven't found the chairman? We're doing our best, but we don't have any leads. He's already an hour late. The VI Ps in attendance are starting to get annoyed. Principal. All the students are in the dorm boycotting the ceremony. Shit!

My deal is done. I'm just going to kick back and watch you. Ladies and gentlemen. Our School of Hope calls forth a brilliant tradition. I'd like to start this 25th Anniversary Ceremony by making an apology to you all. As you may be aware, our chairman, Mr. Sato, is an influential man in the political affairs of our nation. In recent days, troubles inside and outside of the political arena at this very critical moment have required Mr. Sato to immediately report to headquarters in Tokyo. He had to change his plans late last night and make an emergency trip. I plead that you all understand and accept these circumstances. Lying fool! The chairman's right here. Mr. Sato! Chairman. What are you doing? Get out of the way! Mr. Ishihara, no matter how hard you try to save face for the school, the School of Hope is collapsing. Do you hear that noise? All of you, listen well to the sound of the School of Hope collapsing. A cold wind is blowing Not a soul on campus The shadows cast are full oflies That's me in my school uniform Purposely with a light step I continue to walk A cute little pup comes to play And won't leave me alone Days of song are so far away They'll never come again for me Cut it out! Get out! All female students, abide by law and order. Quickly remove the barricades. Stop your useless resistance and remove the barricades. Stop throwing rocks! It's hazardous to throw rocks.
