Juliette, it is Marie again. Call me back as soon as you can, please. Would it kill her to be on time for once! Don't worry, darling. She will be here. She is supposed to be bringing the flowers. At this rate, the guests will arrive before she does! Perhaps she is driving and can't answer her phone. -Right, I'm going back to my dish. -I know, but still. This is Juliette we are talking about, Mom! I know, but she could have made an effort for our 35 year anniversary. The florist is right by her house! I will get the flowers, Mom. Great! Really? -Of course. -Oh, thank you, darling. Are you sure it is no bother? You look exhausted. I was working late last night. What happened to your cheek? I was trying to fix a cross-trainer. Unsuccessfully. Be careful, sweetheart. My goodness, Sandra. You look as shattered as he does! Is the baby not sleeping? Right. I will be back in a quarter of an hour. Dear me. Another night shift at the airport? Yeah, on the last flight from Lisbon. OK. I better go feed this one. -Do you have all the sheet music? -Yes, don't worry. What is this? My little surprise. Oh, Franck! It is beautiful! Do you recognize it? It is the tree where we had our first kiss. You mean where I kissed you. You were too shy to make the first move! It is gorgeous. What is it? Chocolate? Of course! Go get changed. The guests will be here soon. Your shirt is upstairs. I got this, Chef. It is gorgeous. Yes, you never know. I hope he will be all right. Excuse me. Paul! I was beginning to think you weren't coming. I'm sorry. I was late coming from Aix. You know how work is. It is fine. We haven't even got to the gifts yet. Nadia? -Sweetheart? -Yes? Ah! Paul Danceny! Delighted to meet you, Pierre. Then again, I have heard so much about you, I feel like I already know you. Oh, don't be so formal, you two! Hi there. Louise. The cursed daughter. Louise is a lawyer. -Criminal law. -No one is perfect. I often defend victims of police brutality. Lucky them. As you can see, she is very fond of officers of the law. I wanted to say a few words before we bring out the food. Could I have your attention, please? Marie, give me a hand. Well, I wanted to thank you all for coming to celebrate our wedding anniversary with us in this new restaurant. A place that is the result of my long career. But none of this would have been possible without the patience and support of my dear Marie. -Stop it, you! -I'm serious. Well, everyone knows that patience and support are some of my finest qualities. I also wanted to thank you all for being here. And I just want to say how proud I am of you. You have earned this. But our greatest pride and joy is the family we have built. Alex and Sandra and little Margaux and Louise, our eldest daughter. -A lovely family. -Oh yes, we are truly blessed. Oh, hang on! Thank you for coming. It means a lot to me. Come and meet my boss, Police Commissioner Florence Mertin. Alex, please. Yes? Mr. Jourdan. At 12:32 p.m., I am placing you under arrest during an impending investigation regarding the death of Juliette Raven. What? She was murdered at her home last night. The cleaner found the body this morning. No. It is not possible. Not my son. Alex! Believe me, I wouldn't be here if the charges against you were not serious. -There must be some mistake! -Of course! And we are going to solve it here and now. Sweetheart? Marie, it would be better if he went quietly. I am so sorry, Marie. Leave the cuffs. You have the right to an attorney. That's me. Very well. Let's go. Don't worry, darling. We are here. Don't worry, Mom. I will sort this. Don't worry. Louise is with him. Alex will be back by nightfall. Daniel, please, tell me what is going on. Your son was sleeping with the victim. I'm sorry, Marie. I'm here, Marie. Darling, stay with Sandra and the baby. We are going to Juliette's house. If your son was arrested that quickly, then they must have solid evidence. If he is innocent, someone is trying to frame him. Of course he is innocent. My son is not a murderer! He would never cheat on his wife, let alone with Juliette. What do you mean? That's what the sergeant said. OK. Tell me about the victim. For some, Juliette was sensitive, kind, hard-working. A great woman with great values. A good person. And for others? She was a pain in the ass. I never heard you say such nice things about a journalist. I often said she would make a good cop. She had a hunch for things. She was stubborn. Sounds like someone else I know. Hey, Jérémy. Is it just the two of you? Yeah, we are just finishing up. I'm sorry to hear about your son. But I can't let you in. It is just to save time. We will get to see the police statement. My daughter is Alex's attorney. This man is one of us. Captain Paul Danceny, Gendarmerie Aix-en-Provence. -I understand, but... -We won't touch a thing. You can stay with us the whole time. Jérémy, I want to know who killed Juliette Raven. Who really killed her because it wasn't my son. Fine. Come in. The ME estimated time of death between 10 p.m. and midnight. Roughly speaking. Mrs. Picot, the neighbor, called the police at 11 a.m. She was coming to clean the apartment. What about my son? The neighbor saw him go into the apartment last night. She heard the two of them arguing. And it wasn't the first time. Apparently, Alex and Juliette were in a relationship for several weeks. That is ridiculous! We found a bunch of texts on his cellphone. Is that the only evidence you have? The victim had sex before she died. There are no signs of violence. The case is therefore being considered as a crime of passion. How did she die? Strangulation. We found a man's scarf near the body. Thank you, Jérémy. I will see you later. The scarf belongs to your son, doesn't it? It was a Christmas present from me. Shit. Did you know he was sleeping with Juliette Raven? Of course not! Juliette is a friend of Louise's from school. I have no idea what is going on. OK, calm down. Your son sleeping with the victim doesn't make him a criminal. Was he with someone at the time of death? His wife, maybe? No, his wife was on call at the airport. She is part of the ground crew for an airline in Bordeaux. Alex said he stayed late after the gym closed to fix something or other. Good. That's really good. There must be some sort of proof he was at the gym. OK. You go to the precinct and see your son. I will check his alibi. OK? OK. So? Has he said anything? No. Alex refuses to answer any questions. -How is he doing? -He is in complete shock. He keeps saying he didn't kill her. Your son is going to have to start talking, Detective. In light of the charges against him... No, wait. Give me five minutes with him. If he has something to confess, he will confess to me. Florence, I know you want the truth as much as I do. Five minutes. Leave the cameras on. Thank you. Hey, you. Why did you lie to me, Alex? What happened to your perfect life with Sandra... and Margaux? Ever since Margaux was born, things haven't been right between us. The gym is failing. Another one of my screw-ups. I just felt so alone. And that's when... With Juliette? I had never cheated on Sandra before, Mom. I swear. It just happened. Juliette felt the same. We had an intense connection. I knew it could never last, but she made me feel alive. How long? Two months. -Can I see you a moment? -Be right there. I didn't kill her, I swear. OK. Did you check his alibi? I went through the surveillance footage from the gym parking lot. Your son left at 9:22 p.m. and returned at 11:30. Theoretically, that gives him time to kill Juliette and go back to the gym. He has no alibi. Oh my God. OK. So you have motive, a witness who saw you go into Juliette's apartment, and no alibi for the time of death. I didn't kill her, Mom. What time did you leave her place last night? A little after 11 p.m. We had a fight. She told me it was over. I was a married man and it was wrong. And then what? How did you take it? I completely freaked out. I begged her to change her mind. Screamed. So, she got scared and threw an ashtray at me. And then what? I felt like such a pathetic loser. So I left. But she was still alive, I swear. I would never hurt Juliette. OK. Then why did you pretend everything was fine these past two years? Because I'm not you, Mom! I lied because I didn't want to let you down. I didn't want you to be ashamed of me. You gotta get me out of here, Mom. Thanks. Marie told me you and Juliette were close. I don't think it has hit me yet. I'm trying to put off the moment when I realize my friend has been murdered. And your brother might have killed her. I hope he told your mother everything because otherwise... Even though he hates disappointing Mommy dearest, I'm sure Alex told her the truth. Our mother has always protected him. Unlike you, you mean? Ready to go back in? He didn't do it. He is innocent. Commissioner. I just got the results from the lab. They found your son's fingerprints at the crime scene. Of course they did. He was cheating on his wife with Juliette. He messed up. But he told me he didn't do it, and I believe him. If we can't prove it, then we have to find who did do it. -And we are running out of time. -I understand, Detective, but I have been told to close the investigation and get Alex to confess. I can't put more of my officers on this case -unless-- -I can work on it. I'm a gendarme from out of town. I can slip under the radar. -Listen-- -If anything goes wrong, the Captain will say he acted without your consent. I will need her help. Detective Jourdan knows the region and the victim. And you know as well as I do that what matters to her is the truth. You have got two days. If you don't find anything before then, Alex will be charged with first-degree murder. Excuse me. Hello? OK, let's get to it. I will do everything I can to delay his trial. I will call the judge. We went to school together. I will explain everything-- Forget it, Mom. His wife works for Josselin Delmont, remember? Who is Josselin Delmont? My mother's arch nemesis. That's him. Charismatic and ambitious, as likable as he is ruthless. He works in real estate, right? And the business of fraud and bribery. He is a favorite among the local bigwigs here. Who is that in the photo with him? Victoria, his daughter. Delmont is training her to take over the business. The apple of his eye. Yes, we took over the case, but we haven't got a lot of time to find the real killer. OK. I will keep you posted. Love you, darling. How is he doing? Oh, you know your father. The eternal optimist. He is doing fine. Tell me. Did you know Alex was sleeping with Juliette? My friends' private lives are just that, private. And what about your brother's life? Come on, Mom! You don't need to know everything about your children's lives! Based on what I read, Juliette was an intense journalist. Last year alone, she received six complaints for slander. Maybe this was to do with her career. Do you know what she was working on? I hadn't seen her in a while. But she emailed me a few days ago. She had some legal questions about the second-hand vehicle market. Do you know why? Apparently, there have been several accidents involving used cars. She was following a lead. Did she work from home? Yeah. I have to get back to court. Keep me posted. Right. Let's go to Juliette's. What is she doing in front of the victim's home? Excuse me, ma'am. Captain Paul Danceny, Gendarmerie. Can we have a word? -What is your name? -Muriel Vaudan. Can you explain what you were doing in front of Juliette Raven's home? I called Juliette three times yesterday. But she didn't answer, so I came here. What for? To ask her not to publish my witness statement. OK. Come inside. Be right with you. I never thought he would kill her. Who are you talking about? Norbert Beloc. He sells second-hand cars. Juliette was investigating him. That's why Juliette sent an email to Louise about used cars. Did Juliette contact you? My husband almost died in an accident driving a car he bought off Beloc's website. Because of the car? Yes. The brakes stopped working even though it had supposedly passed its vehicle test the month before. And there were other accidents the beginning of this year. Two of them fatal. Why didn't you report it? I did! But the experts took so long to give their advice. And it is expensive. I work as a cashier. OK. So Juliette was going to publish an incriminating article on Beloc, which would put him out of business. Yes. She contacted other clients from the website to prove Beloc was endangering peoples' lives. Did he know about the article? Yes. He even threatened her. How so? A black SUV tried to run her over the other day when she was on her motorbike. Do you think Beloc killed her? I saw that same black SUV in front of my home last night. Someone threw a brick with a note attached through my window. They threatened my children unless I withdrew my complaint and kept my mouth shut. What the hell is going on? Take these damn things off me! Calm down, Mr. Beloc. It is just procedure. I didn't do anything! Get off me! I sell used cars. I am an honest salesman. I didn't do anything wrong. Several complaints have been made against your company for abuse of trust, fraud, and endangering the lives of others. Oh, sure. That's how it goes. If a customer is unsatisfied, boom, they report me. And you arrest me like some common thief! Give up, Beloc. You knew Juliette Raven was about to publish an article that, worst-case scenario, would shut you down. And, best case scenario for your customers, throw you in jail. You tried to intimidate her, but it didn't work. So you decided to get rid of her once and for all. And you framed Alex Jourdan for her death. We found these photos on your computer. You were stalking Juliette and my son. And this. This is the black SUV you used to try and run over Juliette Raven. OK. I admit it. The photos were blackmail. But she didn't care, so I tried to scare her by knocking her off her bike. So, you admit to trying to kill her once? I see what is going on here. You want to put the blame on me to save your son, but you got no proof. Cut the crap, Beloc. My son is innocent. And even if I have to work day and night, I will find the proof I need to throw your ass in jail. Where were you yesterday between 10 p.m. and midnight? I just wanted to scare the people who spoke to the journalist. Get them to retract their statements. Like throwing a brick into Muriel Vaudan's living room? Do you have the name and addresses of all of them? OK. Fine. I screwed up. But I would never kill the journalist! I swear! When I woke up this morning to get ready for my family party, I never thought my day would end with my daughter's friend at the morgue and my son behind bars accused of her murder. I understand. Thankfully, you are working the case with one of the best gendarmes in France. That's true. Thank you for being here. That's Sandra's car. She and the baby must be here. Good. She needs her family. I wish Alex was here too and I didn't have to bring her the bad news. About Alex's affair or the fact he might have killed someone? Take your pick. The most important thing is we stick together. As a family. We will deal with the rest when it comes. Let's go. Oh, I'm glad you are here, darling. Did you close up the restaurant? No. I don't want people thinking the Jourdan family have anything to hide. Franck is there. You are lucky to have him. -Where are the girls? -Margaux is asleep. And Sandra is in the kitchen. She is not doing well. She knows about Alex and Juliette. The story has already reached social media. Private lives don't exist anymore. But innocent until proven guilty does. I will go see her. Paul, shall I show you to your room? Please. I'm back, Sandra. Marie. How is Alex doing? As well as can be expected. What about you? I'm so sorry for everything that has happened. I don't know what to say. If you need to talk, I am here. You kept telling us that having Margaux would make us happy and change our lives for the better. But the truth is, Alex and I were not ready to be parents. Instead of bringing us closer, it pushed us apart. We got so caught up in our fears and worries that we forgot how to be a couple. I expect that's why Alex felt the need... to look elsewhere. If we had done something, none of this would have happened. The affair with Juliette, the murder, Alex in jail. Don't say that, Sandra. Alex is not a killer. I know my son. Not as well as you thought, it seems. I'm not the only one Alex lied to. A risky move. My mind is elsewhere. Does every parent think they know their child? I don't know, sweetheart. But you and Alex are very close. I think it is a good thing for a child to keep their adult life to themselves. I know, but tonight, our son is sleeping in a cell after being accused of murdering his mistress. Shall I put this on? Since when do you like opera? It was a gift from Franck. La Traviata, the 1957 version. Triple vinyl. A must-have, apparently. Thank you, but I'm not a huge opera fan. I would prefer something more... More... How about this? That's just what I was thinking. -Great minds think alike. -Yeah. Even after 35 years of marriage. Yes? I just got a message from Diawara. Beloc's alibi is confirmed. He wasn't in Angoulême during the time of the murder. Which means Alex is still the main suspect. What if he did do it? Don't, Marie. Every mother insists their son is not a killer. They scream and swear he is innocent up until the judge sentences him to ten years. Or more. Your son is not a killer, OK? -Goodnight. -Night. -Hello? -Hi, it is Diawara. -Hey, Lieutenant. -I sent you an email. Yes, I just got it. I attached the whole file. Were you able to get everything off Beloc's computer? Yes, it is all there. -Great. See you later. -Thanks. Shit. Good morning. Good morning. Did you manage to get some sleep? Not really. I'm waiting for Margaux to wake up. Any news on Alex? No. The lead we were following just dried up. So... It must have been a terrible shock for you to learn your husband was having an affair on the same day he is arrested. Yes. Would you like some freshly squeezed orange juice? Sure, thanks. It must be even harder if you had no idea he was cheating on you. What is going on? Is this a conversation or an interrogation? I'm sorry about your juice. I need to get my daughter ready and go. Hey. How are you doing? The lawyer in me is managing. Juliette's friend and sister of the suspect, not so much. Are my parents home? Your father already left for the restaurant and your mother is in the middle of a call. I just saw Alex. He is coping for now. I don't know how long that will last. We only have 36 hours left to find the real killer. Do you have any leads? I might, but... What? What is it? -Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. -Well? That was the personnel manager. Sandra wasn't working when Juliette was killed. She hasn't worked nights for two years. What the hell? I babysat Margaux dozens of times while Alex and Sandra were working! Could she have a lover, too? Of course not! I don't know anymore. Well, this means Sandra has motive and no alibi. My son, my daughter in-law. Which family member will you accuse next? Sandra knew about Alex and Juliette. She has been lying to us. If she is innocent, why didn't she tell you? Fine. So Sandra knew about Juliette. If every scorned partner become a killer, there would be no one left. Listen, she hasn't worked nights at the airport since her daughter was born. Plus, no one knew where she was the night Juliette was killed. All right. I will talk to Sandra. You two dig through Juliette's private life. You knew her best. Wait. What is that? The Bon Sauveur Clinic. That name. BON SAUVEUR CLINIC Where have I heard that before? What were you doing there, Sandra? BON SAUVEUR CLINIC PRIVATE PSYCHIATRIC UNIT CONTACT DETAILS It should be ready in a couple of days. -Hello. Bon Sauveur Clinic. -Yes, hello. This is Detective Marie Jourdan. Could I speak to your manager, please? Please hold. Hi, Sandra, it is me. Come to lunch at the restaurant at half past 12. I would like to see you. It would do us both good. Yes. Perfect. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Oh, hello, Franck. Thanks, Eric. See you tomorrow. With everything going on, I haven't had time to thank you for the chocolate sculpture and the Callas vinyl. I just wanted to say... I'm so sorry for what is happening to your family. If there is anything I can do... Thanks, Franck. -Here you go. -Thanks, Nadia. -Nadia? -Yes? What is that man doing here? Mr. Delmont? His daughter reserved their usual table. Does she come here often? Once or twice a week for business lunches. Her father comes too. Excuse me. This is the best place to discover true local cuisine. You can trust my daughter. She has excellent taste. She is the one who told me about your start-up, which got you here today. That's not true. Your project got you here. Hello. Welcome. Thank you very much. -I will see you inside, sweetie. -OK. I'm sorry to hear what happened, Mrs. Jourdan. I know we don't choose our children, but still, it must be hard. Especially for a police officer. Spare me, Delmont. I mean it. I know we may have our differences, but I respect you. And I mean it when I say I will get you thrown in jail one day. Of course. I really do admire you, Marie. That's Detective Jourdan to you. Good luck, Detective. Julienne vegetables, the house specialty. -Enjoy. -Thank you, Nadia. So, you wanted to see me? Is it about Alex? Has he been convicted? You knew Juliette and Alex were having an affair. I also know you have been lying about your job and that you were following a course of treatment which you suddenly stopped three weeks ago against the advice of your psychiatrist. So, I just have one question for you. Did you kill Juliette? I was suffering from post-partum depression. Why didn't you say anything? Because I was scared. I was ashamed. Ashamed of what, sweetheart? For not feeling the joy a new mother with a healthy baby is supposed to feel. A mother who is unable to love her child because she is in too much pain. Did Alex know about this? He had his own problems with work, so I just closed myself off and... We just kept growing apart. I can't believe I didn't see it. I was seeing a psychiatrist and was on a ton of tranquilizers. Why did you suddenly stop? Because I saw Alex and Juliette together. It was like an electric shock. I was on medication and I was about to lose everything. I needed to find the strength to fight for our relationship. Why didn't you tell Alex you knew? Because I was incapable... of controlling myself and risk losing the man I love. So, I decided to organize a surprise. A trip to Italy. Just the two of us, to reconnect. We haven't had time alone since Margaux was born. I wanted to fight for him, Marie. I swear. That is good news. OK. Keep us posted about anything you find in the phone records. Yeah, we just arrived at Juliette's. OK. See you later. -So Sandra didn't do it? -No. But she found out about the affair through a photo sent by text. -Anonymously, I presume? -Yes. -A jealous lover? -That is your mother's theory. A lover who couldn't stand the idea of Juliette being in a relationship with your brother. And it is up to us to find them. Good. It is not sealed. An ex-lover. Might as well look for a needle in a haystack! That bad? If I had led the life Juliette did, my mom would have come down hard. Really? I thought she liked Juliette. Juliette was different. Exempt from the rules? My mother and I had barely spoken in almost three years. Ever since I represented Delmont during his trial. That must have made Marie pretty mad. I took my shot. Up until then, I was the good worker bee in a small town law firm. Besides, we have always had a complicated relationship. It certainly sounds like it. I'm not trying to antagonize my mother, I was just being true to myself. I get it. You are the eldest child. Like me. Eldest kids always have it tough. The adopted big sister of a miracle baby. It is certainly a lot. My mother didn't tell you? I was adopted when I was three months old. They had been trying for years. Everything was perfect, and then, just after my fourth birthday, surprise. My mother fell pregnant. -OK. -And so, Princess Louise, their little ray of sunshine, she doesn't understand much, except her sun's rays are about to be eclipsed by her coddled little brother. If Alex so much as coughed, my mother would panic. -You were jealous? -Well, sure. Jealous, sad, angry. Indignant. Especially when I found out I was adopted. So Princess Louise became a rebel. I guess I was trying to... get my mom to notice me. But it never really worked. Even by becoming a lawyer? Thank you, Doctor. That officially concludes the Louise Jourdan case file. Did Juliette have an accident three months ago? I found a prescription for a wrist X-ray and enough painkillers to knock out an elephant. Yeah. She hurt herself bike riding in the forest. That's odd. The medical team were called at 1 a.m. A bit late for a walk in the forest. Why would she lie to me? What was she hiding? A violent lover, maybe? We have to find something. Your mother's boss gave us till tomorrow to find the killer. Look what I found in a box for charity. "Love is lived, love is read. "I cherish every page of our great love story." "You are my other half. My whole world. "My passion, my truth." Same blue ink and handwriting. No name, just a star. It is the same in this book. Just a star. Juliette wanted to get rid of the gifts from a very lovesick man. A lovesick man who couldn't handle their separation. Perfect timing. I just read Juliette's phone records. One number kept cropping up these past few months. Did you find the number in her phone? Yes. Blocked. In October. The same time Juliette and my son started their affair. Sounds to me like a jealous lover who is more than willing to send photos to his rival's wife, Sandra. Perhaps even capable of violence. A fractured wrist at 1 a.m. Maybe that's why she broke up with him. Could he be our killer? Maybe. What is all this? Gifts from our mystery suspect. The victim was planning to get rid of them. He signed every one of them. What is it, Marie? Juliette didn't want you, anymore, Mr. Neuville. You are a jealous, violent man. You couldn't bear her leaving you for another, so you strangled her and framed Alex Jourdan. I met Juliette a few months ago. I fell head over heels. But she... She said she didn't want to commit to anything. But I was in love with her. I had plans for our future. So she dumped you? Almost three months ago. I kept telling her I wanted to go public with our relationship. I wanted to give her everything. So when she refused, you lost it, and you hit her? No! I would never do that. We saw the medical certificate! She hurt her wrist throwing my things outside. But you kept harassing her, calling her. Even though she was with Alex Jourdan. I was trying to convince her to take me back. I would have done anything. Call me pathetic if you like, but it is true. What is pathetic is the photo you sent to Sandra Jourdan. I know, I have no excuse... But I was desperate. I made some poor decisions. Like strangling Juliette Raven? If you couldn't have her, no one could. Is that it? Franck, where were you between 10 p.m. and midnight? At the restaurant. And then in my truck. I went to Cognac to get the chocolate sculpture. I left Angoulême after my shift at 11 p.m. I got home at about 1:30 a.m. OK. We will check your story. In the meantime, don't leave town. No, of course. I'm so sorry, Marie. Franck and Juliette? My God. You think you know someone. You trust them and in the end... Franck is our number one suspect right now. I hope for Alex's sake, you have a solid lead. I got permission for Sandra to visit him in prison. Our family will be reunited soon. We still have to prove he is guilty, Mom. We can't charge the suspect we have just to get Alex released. Of course not. We will have confirmation of Neuville's alibi tomorrow morning. I know you are a lawyer, Louise, but you are on your brother's side, right? Of course I am. I want Alex out of prison, but I also want to find my friend's killer. Of course. That is what we all want. I hope you will do as good a job releasing your brother as you did acquitting Delmont. Marie. -I'm outta here. -No, wait... I... I will take care of it, OK? See you. Louise! So, what do we do now? I haven't seen the sites yet. Did my mom ask you to babysit me? No. OK, fine. I will show you around. -Yes! -Come on! It is not my fault. The table is slanting! Look at it! Plus, I'm not on my home turf! This is a great place. You wanted to see my favorite spots. I do. What is next? I want to know everything. -Two beers, please. -Coming up. Well, I love Le Jardin Vert park. So cliche, I know, but the view of the town from the ramparts is incredible. I go for a run there when I need fresh air. -I would like to see that. -Sure. Bravo! I met Juliette at a party. We hated each other at first. Two strong characters take time to like each other. But then you became friends? We only really became close three years ago, working on the Beach river case. What is that? The name of a nightclub near Angoulême. There was a large fire just after it opened. Three dead and 30 injured. Josselin Delmont was the owner. Who you got acquitted? And whom I cut ties with immediately after. It is no secret that Delmont is a creep. But it was a good case? It earned me a reputation. But it cost me my mother's respect. Goodnight, Chef. See you tomorrow. Goodnight, Nadia. I understand. I'm so pleased for you both, Sandra. Take care. Kiss my granddaughter for me. Talk soon. Sandra saw Alex. -And? -They had a good talk. The kind they hadn't had for years. They said they love each other and they want to try again as a couple, as a family. I'm so pleased for them. Come on. OK. Cheers. To you. It is weird. I can't get hold of Louise -or Paul. -What are you afraid of? Nothing. Nothing. It is just... Paul doesn't have a key. How will he get home? You are allowed to want to take care of your daughter. Better late than never. That includes me. We were never very good at protecting Louise. She never really needed us. Maybe. Or maybe we never asked her. Do you think I put my foot in with Louise? No, but perhaps you should stop mentioning Delmont. It is still a sore topic. Easy for you. He is a client. No, his daughter is. She is an admirable young woman who has done a lot of good for my restaurant's reputation. What are you doing? It is for Alex. Sandra said he didn't eat what they brought him. Don't judge me. Put a crème brûlée in there, too. It is good to see you eat. We are not giving up, you know. Paul and I are on the case. Your sister is in your corner and your father... He is helping, too. When he is not making pâté. I know, Mom. Weirdly, I think I'm OK. I was sick of lying to Sandra. And to you. Well, I am glad to hear that. I really messed up. You can say that again! I spoke to Sandra. She still loves you, you know. Even if things are hard right now, perhaps you should try starting again? Oh, good, Jérémy. You wouldn't happen to have a bottle of Haut-Médoc to go with this goat's cheese, would you? Sorry, Detective. It is time for your son to return to his cell. Of course. Thanks, Mom. For everything. Stay strong, sweetheart. -See you tomorrow. -Get home safe. What time do you call this? Were you waiting up for me? Worried I will turn into a pumpkin? Well, I had a great night with Louise. She is smart, strong, sensitive. A surprising young woman. I know. She is my daughter. I thought you were here to help Alex, -not profile Louise! -Really? I thought I came here to spend the week with my friend for her wedding anniversary. Paul, you have no chance with Louise. She hates cops. Maybe not all cops. Besides, I am a gendarme. That's enough! My family is out of bounds. How would you like it if I had flirted with your father? Are you kidding? I would love you to be my stepmother! I... Go to bed! Goodnight, Mommy. Unbelievable. NATIONAL POLICE FORCE Well? Virgile Colon, the master chocolatier who made the tree for your anniversary confirms Franck Neuville's alibi. His workshop is 25 miles away. Plus, the coroner narrowed down the time of death. Between 11 and midnight. There is no way Neuville could have been back before then. Not before 1 a.m. at least. Shit. We are handing over the case in just a few hours and Alex will be taken to court. What do we do? Can we look at the victim's computer? Try a new lead? She doesn't have one. Not since she got hacked. She wrote everything down. Then we need to access her professional case files. Anything she worked on the past six months. We collected everything from her home, but I haven't had the time-- Well, make time! I want it all in my office, now. Shit, shit, shit. What is it? Apparently, Juliette had been investigating Delmont for a year. She had found a ton of stuff. Mainly tax fraud. Apparently, with his illegal earnings, Delmont was creating small companies that were buying up the public and private markets through bribery and blackmail. -Any proof? -No. That's the problem. Hers and mine. There are plenty of suspicious elements but no solid proof that could send him down. Look. Juliette also had a file on Delmont's daughter. -She was investigating her. -Princess Victoria! She got into the business school of Bordeaux with flying colors. That's one of the best schools in France. Here, I found her entrance exam results. "Result, 11.5. Unsuccessful candidate." And then two days later. "15.55. Honorable admission." Something changed their minds. Hang on. I think I have something. Here it is. I highlighted it. A payment of 50,000 euros to the school's charity. From COGIP, one of Delmont's fake companies, located in a tax haven. -Can you prove it? -No, unfortunately. But now we know Delmont bribed the jury to get his daughter in. His daughter is everything to him. And he would do anything for her. But that is not all. Thanks to a soon-to-be-acquired start-up, the vegetation structure on the whole outside of the building will be planted with a 20% reduction. The river banks of Charentes are all about respecting the environmental norms and self-sustainable energy. But more importantly, they are about profit and dividends. We may not be working together as of yet, but you will soon see I know exactly what my promoters and investors need. As well as interfering busybodies. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Detective Marie Jourdan with the police. Captain Paul Danceny, National Gendarmerie. You may not know Josselin Delmont, but unfortunately, I do. And what he is promising you comes with a hefty price. This promising project is made up of bribes, rigged adjudications, and tax fraud. As well as a little bit of blackmail for anyone foolish enough to not do exactly as he says. I must ask you to leave, Detective. You have no business here. Wait a minute, Delmont. I haven't finished painting my beautiful picture. You see, Delmont is like that. It's in his nature. Say, for example, his daughter fails her entrance exam, Daddy pulls out his checkbook, her grades go up, and there, Ms. Delmont gets in with flying colors. Sweetheart, it is not what you think. Something I said? You will have to excuse Detective Jourdan, whose son is currently incarcerated for the murder of his mistress. Mrs. Jourdan loves fabricating crimes that naturally, I have never been charged for. Not even once. I could report her for the umpteenth time for harassment and slander, but... I find Mrs. Jourdan amusing. So, why don't you take the time to read through the brochure and I will be with you shortly. Five minutes. Out in the hall. Oh, we are going to need more than that. Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen. Juliette Raven had been investigating you for over a year. And at the exact same time she discovers you bribed your daughter's school, she is murdered. Bit of a funny coincidence. Yes, true. I'm sorry, I have no idea what you are talking about. Where were you Friday the 12th between 11 p.m. and midnight? With my daughter and Matis Forget, my financial manager, preparing for this meeting. We finished up late, well past 1 a.m. I invite you to check. I haven't seen you before. You have to know that any felony committed here in Angoulême is blamed on yours truly. But a premeditated crime is a new one. Sir, you seem to misunderstand-- No, forgive me. You must understand we have a certain amount of respect for each other. Which is why I truly want to help you, Marie. Do not call me Marie. Alex is innocent. All you want is for your son to be released. You are his mother, after all. And I can help. I have a witness who will swear in court they saw your son at the other end of town when the crime occurred. You make me sick. False testimony? Oh, don't be so dramatic! Do you realize what you just said to an officer of the law? And what did I suggest, exactly? People like you have no shame. Which, luckily, makes you easier to spot. My son will not go to prison, but I will make sure you do, Delmont. You know, if I had a euro for every time you have said that to me, I'd be a rich man. Oh, wait. I already am! Have a nice day. Dammit. We need to find out more about Victoria. Did you see her face when you mentioned her school? She had no idea about the bribery. Her father is hiding things from her, too. You are right. She could be the weak link. -Hello again, Victoria. -I have nothing to say to you. -If you are looking for my father-- -No. We came to see you. Thank you. It can't be easy working for your father and going to college. Finance? I have an end of term exam next Monday. I'm sure you will be fine. Especially with your boyfriend helping you. Matis Forget, right? I found out he works for your father. Financial manager at 30, very impressive! He must be very good or very loyal. He doesn't want to upset his boss. Particularly if his boss is his father-in-law. If I were him, I might even be tempted to lie about where I was the night Juliette Raven was murdered. Like I said this morning, Juliette had just discovered your father bribed your school to make sure you got in. Juliette Raven asked your school to do something about it. Instead, the principal warned your father Friday afternoon, a few hours before her death. That is hardly evidence. No. You are absolutely right. But Juliette was also investigating you, Ms. Delmont. And by following one of her leads, we found this. Your name is on the organization chart of over 20 companies located in several tax havens. Sometimes as manager, sometimes as CEO. Your father uses these companies for money laundering and bribery. You know enough about finance to know if these companies were ever prosecuted, you would take the fall. This is news to you, it seems. Which means your father keeps a lot of secrets, even from his own daughter. I'm sure he loves you very much, Ms. Delmont, in his own way. I don't understand. Victoria, were you really with him Friday night between 11 p.m. and midnight? Hi, Mr. Forget. Please call me back urgently. It is a matter of police business. OK. So Victoria folds, and once her boyfriend, the financial manager, follows suit, bye-bye alibi. Is this it? Do you finally have him? I always thought I would pop a bottle of champagne when this day came, but... now, I just feel sorry for his daughter. What the hell are you doing here, Delmont? Oh, you know me. I can make myself at home anywhere. This is a nice photo of me. I look so young. But this place, so gloomy. Cut the crap, Delmont! Didn't you hear your daughter confessed to not being with you when Juliette Raven was killed? The day she was murdered was when you discovered she was trying to bring you down through your daughter. The bribery, the tax havens, you panicked. You were going to lose everything. Your reputation, your companies. Victoria's love. So you went to see Juliette and you threatened her. But when she didn't cave, you killed her. I love my daughter very much, Detective. But she is a very sensitive young woman. So, after you told her all those horrible things about me, she wanted to get revenge. To hurt me by telling a bunch of lies. I don't blame her, of course. Nor you. You won't get away with this. I imagine what with everything going on, you haven't had time to properly go through my business accounts. Pity. Then you might have read one of the Luxembourg investment companies run by my daughter lent to Chef Pierre Jourdan the necessary sum to start up his restaurant. You are bluffing. I never joke about money, Mrs. Jourdan. It would be a blemish on your husband's career if people found out his establishment was financed through the "recycled money" of your sworn enemy. My husband financed his restaurant through loans from the local banks. If you say so! But you should talk it over with him, just in case. Oh my, is that the time? I better get going. Time is money. Have a nice evening. Hello, darling. Does the company COGIP ring any bells? It should. They own 45% of your restaurant shares. Yes, I know them. So? I thought all the loans you made were from local banks. I did, but the BMU dropped me at the last moment. I was too old, the sum was too high. But I wouldn't budge. My project was an ambitious one, so... I accepted a loan from a Luxembourg company who was willing to invest. Why are you asking me all this? Pierre, that company belongs to Josselin Delmont. How was I supposed to know that? You should have checked! He has us both right where he wants us! If I arrest him for the murder of Juliette, everyone will know the husband of Detective Jourdan was bought. Well, forgive me for thinking someone might have been interested in my project! For not thinking about my wife, the policewoman, rather than my own dream! For not being as perfect as you! -Listen-- -No, you listen, Marie! You are too hard on people! Hard with others and with yourself. Your headstrong character, your demanding nature, your radical values. It is too much! It is suffocating. Suffocating me. Thirty-five years of marriage and you couldn't tell me this sooner? I know. You are right. But things have to change. We can't go on like this. Not after everything that has happened. OK. So now, my priorities are getting my son released and trying to stop my husband being taken to court. Don't worry about that. This is my mess. And I'm going to sort it out right now. Well? Tomorrow at noon, Alex will be taken to court and charged with Juliette's murder. How is the investigation going? Where is Mom? She went to see your father. That's her. Hey, Marie. I still haven't heard from the accountant, little Victoria's boyfriend. So, I thought if we grab him at 6 a.m. tomorrow, we can put him in custody and topple Delmont's alibi. You know what will happen. What that means for your husband and family. Paul, I need to free my son. I gotta go. Your mother is about to make a big mistake. You can't do this, Mom. Do what? Delmont has already hired an entire law firm to cover his ass. He will never be charged for murder. We don't have enough. We need strong, solid evidence to bring before the judge. If you go for him, Delmont will tell the press your husband took dirty money. He has the perfect retaliation. And Dad will suffer. I want to help your father, too. But in the meantime, your brother is locked up instead of the real killer. Marie, I don't think Delmont killed Juliette. There are far easier and less risky ways to get rid of a journalist. And framing the son of Detective Jourdan is not one of them. Impressive argument, you two. But I know Delmont best. Maybe, but I know Dad. He opened the restaurant so you could be proud of him. Like he has been proud of you for 40 years. He wanted to be your rock when you retired. That was his dream too. -Listen-- -Enough. Why did you change sides? To piss me off or seduce my daughter? I'm on no one's side. I'm going to bed. I will leave you to think everything over. I will see you in the morning. Wait! Fancy a cup of coffee? You know if I drink coffee after four, I won't be able to sleep. Of course I do. You are my daughter. How about herbal tea? How about a cognac? You and Paul seem to be getting along well. -Sure, he is nice. -Good. I'm glad. I am very fond of him, and I knew you might not be a fan, considering his line of work. You know why I hate cops. It is your way of rebelling against your cop mother. Come on, Mom. Thanks. All through my childhood, I heard what you went through in your job. The hell your colleagues put you through, not just because you were a woman but because you were different. All the humiliation, laughing at you behind your back. It hurt me, Mom. And it disgusted me. So, yes. I do have a slight issue with the forces of the law. I'm sorry. I had no idea. I never saw how much it hurt you. But you know, it would have been the same no matter what job I did. I was so caught up in my job, so determined to succeed, not just for me but so that I could break down barriers, open people's minds. -And you did, Mom. -Maybe. But at what cost? Stop. I'm fine. But it feels good to talk about it. Me too, sweetheart. Cheers. To my baby girl. How are you feeling? Still angry about what I said last night? My husband didn't come home for the first time in 35 years and my partner has given up on me. So to answer your question, I'm not feeling great. Don't say that, Marie. I said what I said because that is how our partnership works. When one of us is stuck or too emotionally involved, the other one is there to stop them from making a mistake. You have always been there for me. Now, it is my turn to be there for you. Even if it makes you hate me. You think I'm making a mistake with Delmont? Yes, I do. Excuse me. Yes, Commissioner. OK. We will be right there. Delmont has been murdered. According to the ME's preliminary examination, Josselin Delmont was struck around the head with a bronze art sculpture. Any idea what time? Between 8 and 10 p.m. Any signs of a break-in? Lieutenant. No. Excuse me. Delmont must have known his attacker. I imagined him led out in cuffs in prison or in court so many times but never dead. So if Delmont didn't kill Juliette, that means Alex is still our main suspect. He will be charged. -Detective? -Yes? We found Delmont's cellphone. His last incoming call was from your husband at 6:42 p.m. It lasted 25 seconds. Do you know why he was calling? No. I mean, yes. Probably to book him a table at the restaurant. I will ask him. I will see you back at the office. Victoria Delmont, -his daughter, where was she? -At her mother's in Bordeaux. She spent the night there. Apparently, she had a fight with her father. Of course. Thanks, Lieutenant. We can move the delivery to tomorrow. Let me call you back. Josselin Delmont is dead. -What? -Why did you call him, and did you go to his home last night? Wait. You think I killed him? I really hope not. But two hours after you said you were going to sort it, we find him dead. So, did you go to his home? Yes or no? Yes. After you left last night, I was so angry, I wanted to kick his ass. For what he had done to us. To our son who is in jail because of him. So I called him and he asked me to come by. What time did you get there? Around 7:15-7:30 p.m. But when I got to his door, I realized it was a huge mistake, so I left. Where did you go? I went for dinner at Thibaut's. Your wine merchant? What time? A little around 8. By the time I came back here, it was half past midnight. I went to sleep in my office. So, that's it, Detective. Believe me if you like or check my alibi. OK. OK, great. Come by the precinct to confirm your statement. Thanks. I just confirmed your husband's alibi. He was with his friend when Delmont was killed. Good. I would hate to imagine my son and husband sharing a cell. Have you noticed all the victims have something to do with your family? Alex and Juliette, Delmont and Pierre. You think it is the same killer? Juliette investigates Delmont, she is killed. Then he is murdered... for what reason? I don't know. Perhaps someone doesn't want us finding out something in Delmont's affairs. That puts this entire town on our suspect list. However... you are right about the link between my family and when the victims were killed. OK. Your son is accused of murder. Your husband just avoided that fate. Could it be some sort of revenge? But what is the link between all these people? Your daughter told me about the nightclub that burned down. So? Louise got Delmont acquitted. Following Juliette's report -which blamed the architect? -Right. Let me call her. -Hello. I'm not available... -Voicemail. Hey, Louise. It is Paul. I'm here with your mother. Call me back, please. I have a few questions about the nightclub fire. Call us back soon, sweetheart. It is urgent. Bye. Thanks. BEACH RIVER TRAGEDY ARCHITECT TO BLAME OK. So, Juliette clearly thought the architect was responsible. She was very thorough, but man, was she harsh. That was pretty much her trademark. BEACH RIVER TRAGEDY TRAGIC SUICIDE WOMAN JUMPS FROM 5TH FLOOR The architect committed suicide six months after the trial ended. "A victim of hatred, "insults, and attack on social media, "the architect convicted for the fire at Beach River "threw herself out of the window of her building." When was this? December 15th. The same date Delmont was killed! Hang on. Are you saying Delmont was murdered exactly three years and almost the exact same time after the death of Leslie Meunier? That can't be a coincidence! Let me see if her social media page is still active. That's Franck. They were a couple? It would certainly seem so. So... Franck Neuville could be out for revenge on everyone he believes responsible for the death of the woman he loved? Juliette incriminated her in her article. Delmont was acquitted and got off scot-free. Yes, thanks to Louise. Which means Louise is next on the list. We have to arrest Franck. Except he has an alibi. The night Juliette was killed, he was off getting your chocolate sculpture. Check his alibi again. I will call Pierre. -Hello? -Hey, it is me. -Is Franck with you? -No. Any idea where he is? No. No idea. Is something wrong? No, I just want to talk to him. Can you send me his number? -Of course. -OK. Love you. -Hello. I'm not available... -Shit! I spoke to the chocolatier. I twisted his arm. He told me everything. Leslie Meunier was his niece. She was like a daughter to him. He never got over her suicide. And Franck asked him to be his alibi? Yes. He told me Franck went to see Juliette Raven to collect some documents. He told him she was dead when he arrived. The guy bought it. So Franck's alibi is dead. OK. Let's go. You try Louise's law firm, I still can't get hold of her. Hey, guys. Jérémy, we have our killer. Franck Neuville. He is going after Louise. I will send you their numbers -and you locate them ASAP. -On it, Boss. Let's go, guys! OK. Thank you very much. Well? Louise had an early meeting in court. She is not back yet. She said she needed some air. Where would she go? She told me she liked to go for a run to clear her head. She liked to go running in a park... Le Jardin Vert! Let's go. Franck, hi. Is everything OK? I never understood how you managed to sleep at night. How you erased it from your conscience. The fact you killed an innocent woman. Leslie Meunier, the architect you found guilty of the death of all those people so you could protect a scumbag criminal. -Franck, I'm just a lawyer-- -No! You defended Delmont out of pure cynicism. And you sacrificed the woman I loved for your ambition. Franck, I didn't know... I'm sorry. Too late. Louise! Louise! Neuville! Oh my God. Paul! Paul! Hold on, Louise. I'm coming! -Oh my God. -I'm coming! Don't move. -I'm almost there. -I'm slipping! Give me your hand. It is OK. I got you! Come on. You can do it. Hang on! You did it! I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. What a way to start a relationship! OK. Got it. Thanks. Go get the witness statements from the people over there. I never meant to kill Juliette. I just wanted to ruin her career. I wanted her to pay for what she did to Leslie. But something happened. You fell in love with her. I tried to fight it, but... I so wanted to be happy with Juliette. But I felt so guilty. I couldn't let go of the past. Our relationship became a real struggle, until eventually... she left me. But that's not why you killed her. No. I was waiting outside her home when your son left. I wanted to explain to her why I lied. But when Juliette got mad, she could be very, very hurtful. When she tried to throw me out and call Louise to tell her, I tried to stop her. But I never meant to hurt her! But you did. You strangled her. Then what happened? You saw she was dead, so you thought you could kill two birds with one stone. Get rid of her lover and frame Louise's brother. I didn't plan any of this, I swear. That didn't stop you letting my son take the blame. What about Delmont? This was all his fault. For the nightclub construction, he forced Leslie to work on a tight quote that would halt any architect. She was forced to hire low-quality builders who all had to pay Delmont part of their commission. But she wasn't able to prove it. When the nightclub caught fire, she was devastated. Then all Delmont had to do was manipulate Juliette and Louise with some false documents to solidify his defense. Leslie became the scapegoat. The one to blame. The murderer. I was the one who found her body at the bottom of our building. It took you three years to kill Delmont. I won't shed any tears over his death. And I imagine you won't, either. My job is to uphold the law and make sure others do the same. You are a killer. You murdered two people and you tried to murder my daughter. You will pay for this, Neuville. Get him out of here. How are you doing, sweetheart? I was so scared. I know I haven't always done things right by you. And I'm sorry. So, so sorry. I can't take it back. But I just wanted to say... I am so proud of you and the woman you have become. I love you, my baby girl! I love you too, Mom. OK, that is everything. So, should I tell your parents, or do you want to do it? If your mother has her gun on her, I don't want to be shot at! Are you sure you don't need help? And if you say, "No, I am the chef," I am ordering sushi! I just wanted to say... I love you. I love you too. Sit down a minute. I'm sorry. I am so sorry for being so domineering. With you. With our family. I didn't realize how suffocating I was being to the people I love. -Don't say that! -No, it is true. And I also wanted to thank you for helping me get through everything I have been through in our life together, in my job. I would have been lost without you. You are my partner, my other half, my ally. And you are mine, Marie. I know, but I had forgotten that. I'm sorry. Get a room! Leave it out, you two! Cheeky! Would you two mind looking after Margaux for the week? Are you finally going on your vacation? Exactly. A hiking trip to Etna and a vacation in Sicily. Courtesy of my wonderful wife. I am so happy for you both! And we get to spend time with our granddaughter! You will have to tell me her feeding schedule. Right, everyone. I hope the table is set because lunch will be ready in five minutes. The chef is back! I will take the bread out. Lunchtime! Coming! Want some white wine? You need to put this on the menu, Dad! Great flavors. It is delicious. You should write a cookbook! Only after I retire! Which won't be anytime soon! Excuse me, you two! -We said my family was off limits. -No, you said! Besides, my daughter is very happy here in Angoulême. She would not like Aix at all. Hypocrite! You loved Aix! Well, I think this is absolutely delicious. And I think you don't want your daughter to go. Of course, I don't want my baby girl to go! Well, you don't have to worry about Aix. Ever since I came here, I have fallen in love... with this town. Besides, two heads are better than one! What do you say, Marie? You and I, the dynamic duo. Hear, hear! Especially with the help of the best lawyer in Angoulême! What exactly are you saying? I mean, a gendarme in the police force. It has got a nice ring to it. So, are you two going to work together in Angoulême? That depends what Mrs. Jourdan says. Which one do you mean? I'm joking, sweetheart. I have finally found a cop I like. And you have a partner who can actually stand you! Ha-ha! Very funny! Welcome to the family, Paul! We are not quite there yet! To an amazing cop, an amazing woman, and my best friend. Such a kissass! Thank you, darling. Mathilda Tavenner Subtitling: Hiventy
