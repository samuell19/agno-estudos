Happy birthday, Honey. What is this? Son of a bitch! Hoang Anh! Please listen to me. Last night my friends were so drunk that they slept over. That's it. Hoang Anh! Stop explaining. Let's break up. Hoang Anh! Hoang Anh! Okay, fine! Let's break up then. Changed your mind, huh? It's you who wanted to break up first. So? Ah! Please, let's have a talk first. What are you guys doing to me? Where is 100,000 dollars of Sis Phuong? Which 100,000 dollars? Four king cards! I got it. Only 100,000 dollars. Put me down. Then I'll pay you. Good. Where is the money? Money... I don't have it yet. Not yet? What are you waiting for? I will have it, Brother. Please put me down. I will definitely have the money. When do you think you will have the money? This afternoon. Definitely. If you don't have it this afternoon... Hung! Where are you? Hung. Hung. One more round, bro? Dad! She's coming. Mr. Sau, what's taking you so long? I'm coming. - Anything for me today? - Nothing, Sis. Dad! Cong! Watch out! What's the hurry? Sorry, Uncle Sau. Don't strip. Told ya. Dad! Sis Linh! Dad! I've got bad news. What's the matter? Mrs. Fatty Tu is coming. Let's hide. Shit! Hey, I'm still outside. Come on in, Dad! Open the door. I know your family is hiding in there. If you don't pay your rent today. I'm not leaving. Sis, let me. Open the door. If you don't, watch me. Crawl after him. Stupid head! I'll count to three. If you don't come out, don't blame me. One… Two… Piggy bank? Three. Oh my kitchen. Mrs. Tu, are you alright? Please stand up, Mrs. Tu. Mrs. Tu. This is all we have. Please take it for now. My father is sick. Louder, Dad! Ah, it hurts so bad. My big brother just had an accident. Mrs. Tu please give us a few more days. No. No more time. If I can't get the money today. I'm not leaving. Mrs. Tu. This is all you've got? Mrs. Tu. What is this? Please have a little love for my father? Are you crazy? Your father looks disgusting. How come I become your step-mother? I meant my father is old, he's sick. I've just had an accident, I can't work. Please have mercy for us. I'm sure you will get skinnier. Shut up! First. I've been having mercy for your family for the last three months. Second. I'm fat because I want to, okay? Piss off. Such an obnoxious face. Mrs. Tu, I'm telling the truth. There's nothing worthy in this house to pawn. Mrs. Tu. Again? I'm telling you… Money is not everything in life. There are gold and diamond, too. Listen. If you know where gold and diamond are, please tell me. If I find them, I will split with you. There're plenty out there, just not in this house. Bullshit. I hate you. Mrs. Tu. Please have mercy for my family and my father. Again? Mercy! My piggy bank. I know. This money will pay for your rent. You promised, Mrs. Tu. Hey boy! This is it? Why bother put it in a piggy bank? My breakfast money. Geez! The piggy bank itself is worth more than the money in it. Hey. This is no way enough to pay for your rent, okay? But you promised. Fine. One more week. If you don't pay your rent. Get out of my apartment. Mrs. Tu! What else? You want another accident, huh? Do you know how it feels when a car runs over you? Want a road-roller running over you? Annoying! Piggy bank, huh! How come I don't remember anything from yesterday? You never remember anything. Hello, Uncle Hai. Hello! Happy birthday! Thank you, Uncle. Don't forget the project I assigned you to. Don't worry, Uncle. We're working on it. This is an important project to mark my company's 50th anniversary. Yeah. Understand? Working on what? Don't worry. We will make it awesome. Goodbye, Uncle! Are you crazy? I'm gonna kill you if he knows that I've spent all his deposit. Bro! Do you forget that you turn 25 today? So what? So you are qualified to inherit your grandma's money. Yeah! That's a lot of money! How come I forgot that! Yes! A whole bunch of money! Marriage contract? Yes. It's written in your grandma's will. Long will become his grandma's qualified heir when he turns 25. But if he's not married. He has to wait till the year of 30. Huh? When he's 30 years old? No, the year of 2030. What? Why so long? Wait. Are you sure this is the right will? Of course. This condition was just added. To avoid any confusion. You two should just go home and ask your grandma. Grandma, why didn't you tell me I have to get married before inheriting your money? Didn't I? No, not yet. I remember telling you already. On the night when you were drunk. Geez, how could I remember it when I was that drunk? Hey. I just finished a session of skin rejuvenation. Don't get me angry. Grandma! But I… You're a grown up now, be mature. You and Hoang Anh have been together for a while. I think she's good for you. Propose to her. Grandma! But I… Grandma. What now? Bro! Honey! I'm sorry. Please give me another chance. Go away. What are you doing here? I don't want to see your face. Please listen to me, honey. Honey, please marry me. Let go of me, let go. Marry me. Marry me, me. It's fake! You dare to give me a fake ring. Get out of my house. Honey, listen. It's just a difficult time for me now. After we get married, I will buy you a Lamborghini, a villa in Italy. I will take you travel around the world. Just marry me. Get out of my house. Right now. Go. Honey! Sis! Give it to me. Sis. The diamond is fake but the flowers are real. Piss off. Sis! Bro, what now? What else? Find another girl. Mai Phuong. What are you doing here? The time apart has made me realize that… I love you so much. This is… What are you doing to my wife? No. I meant… This is flowers delivery service. Here. The flowers are for her. She is for you. Goodbye. Farewell. I… Mom, is this our father? Daddy! Let go of me. No, I won't. Let go of me. I have a present for you. Mom! Where is Dad running to? Do you remember Diem Huong? Is Huong home? Long, don't you recognize me? Bitch! It's Diem Huong. Huong? Yeah? Remember? Hey! Family combo promotion, please try. Family combo promotion, please try. Thank you. We have a promotion now, please try. Bro. Bao Trang. Traditional folk song style. Looks like your grandma. Good? What's wrong? This style looks good, no? Ah, robbers! They are Mrs. Phuong's people. Mrs. Phuong's people? Where's our money? I haven't had it yet. Not yet? Are you kidding me? Kidding me? Stop please. Just add interest. Interest, huh? Please tell Mrs. Phuong for me. Give me a few more days. I will pay interest too. Hello, Boss. Long asked to pay interest. Please, don't. Yes, I got it. Lucky you, Mrs. Phuong agreed. I'll collect the interest every week until you pay off the debt, okay? I get it. Brother Long. Brother Long. Farewell. Your super plan is over. I… You what? My grandma will be back in two days. I'm still thinking. Bro. Have you ever thought that your wife will be like your grandma. Are you crazy? I don't like older women. No. I meant your wife will be an actress. Stop talking nonsense. Just one famous grandma is enough. Not like that. What I mean is… Move over. Okay, it's fine here. So. We will cast an amateur actress. The newer the better. Nobody knows who she is. Why is that? So she can act as your wife. Go meet Grandma. No strings attached. You will pay her. It's a deal. What if she doesn't want to break up? No way… We have to put it in the contract. She will have to do it. Hey, but this girl must really need money so we can manipulate her. You know. I'm Katherine Huong, 18 years old. I have many talents. Do you need money? Money is not important to me. As long as I get to follow my passion. I used to date many rich men so this role is perfect for me. Next. Yes, Sis? Are you free now? Come over for an audition. But I'm working, Sis. Quit it. Come for an audition. This is a new film. They cast only new actors. Their priority is non famous actors who haven't been on the screen a lot. See, come over. If you are chosen, you'll get a real role. No longer an extra. The fee is high too. 50 thousand dollars. 50 thousand dollars? Is this true? Save me a spot then. I'm coming. Smile. You look so pale. Bro. God, why are you so late? Traffic was so bad, sorry. Hey. Next. Okay, baby. Who is that guy? That handsome man? He's the one to decide if you get the role or not. Go over there and fill in the casting form for me. Quick. Please introduce yourself. Hello. My name is Truong Hung Dung. Nick name is Mai Ly Truong. I see. Thank you for coming. Do I look fresh enough? Super fresh. Hey babe, please come for next film. God! Poor girl. This is the eighth movie she came for audition. Good luck. Your turn, babe. Are you kidding me, Hung? Where did you find these freaks? Be patient, Bro. There are plenty left. You be patient. I'm exhausted. Forget it. Bro! What's the matter? Stand up, please. Audition, right? Yes Come in. Bro, there's a new candidate. Please wait. My name is Nguyen Ha Linh, 22 years old. I can do many things. Especially. I can express many kinds of feelings. Are you a dude or a girl? Of course I'm a girl. A girl. Are you still single? Yes. Good. Why did you decide to come in for audition? I heard the fee is high. What can you do? I can dance. And now I'm very happy. It's so cool. So so happy. I can be a chicken too. Chicken? Family combo, 20 percent discount. Please come in. Dad. Why did you leave me? Do you know how much I miss you? Dad. I always believe that one day you will change your mind. Oh please, drop it. Why so miserable, huh? I think you can have many friends and siblings. But only one father. But he abandoned you. There must be some reason. No parent wants to abandon their children. Children all love their parents. Enough. You got the part. Oh my God! 50 thousand dollars. What is my role? You will play my wife. Do you know your script? If my grandma asks you something that is not in the script. Try to change the subject and let me answer it. Remember? Okay. Wow. Your house is beautiful. Oh, Artist Thanh Hang is your grandma? Is that you, Long? Yes, Grandma. Grandma. I didn't expect I'll get to meet you one day. When my mother was alive. She was a big fan of you. I am too. Really? You look so young and beautiful in real life. Thank you. But you are…? This is Linh, my wife. Your wife? Yes. We met at a cafe. I accidentally bumped into Linh. I felt in love with her since I first saw her. When I saw him, I felt that my other half was standing right in front of me. Then he came to talk to me. We talked as if we had known each other for a long time. She is an interior designer, living and working in Thailand. She was on a holiday in Vietnam. We got a long really well. I hadn't met such an interesting man for a while. Surprisingly, he proposed to me. We had a secret wedding. The only witness is Hung. To avoid the crowd. Oh, congratulations you two. But you have to do one thing for me. Yes, Grandma. Marriage is sacred. I want you two have a proper wedding. We must invite all our relatives and friends. Finally. That will make me happy. My beloved grandson is getting married. I'm so happy. The in-laws are all smiling happily. Your grandma wants a proper wedding. What do we do now? Can't you keep your mouth shut? How can I? The contract didn't say there will be a wedding. But I have no choice now. We have to have a wedding. After I get the money, we will divorce. No way. Then I will be a divorced woman. What are you thinking? I'm definitely not marrying you. What are you thinking? I'm the one who is definitely not marrying you. Do you forget where you come from? You. Ah. You want more money? Women like you. I've met so many. How much? Say it. You over evaluate yourself. I need money but I'm not selling myself. Linh. Get out of my apartment. Mrs. Tu, please let our family stay a few more days. We have no where to go now. - I promise. - Promise, huh? I've heard it so many times. Mrs. Tu, my sister will be home soon. She will have the money for you. Bullshit. When your sister is home, I would die of waiting. You can stay if you have money. If not, piss off. But I'm telling the truth. Please, Mrs. Tu. - Please, Mrs. Tu. - Let go of me. Mrs. Tu. Don't cry. Please don't cry. Why is Sis Linh not home yet? Please stand here, okay? - Mrs. Tu threw us out. - Wait for me here. Mrs. Tu kicked us out. Sis Linh, please come home quick. I'm so cold! I'm cold! Congratulations you two love birds Phan Nhat Long and Nguyen Ha Linh. Louder, please! Who are those people? They look so scary. Stop it. Just play your part. Kiss. My first kiss. More. This apartment is my wedding gift for you two. It's so beautiful, Grandma. Thank you. Grandma. What is it? This is such a tiny apartment. How come there is only one bedroom? It's big for me. You two just got married, you just need one bed. What if we will have six, seven, eight, nine, ten kids? Then I will get you a bigger place. Grandma. If I live here, you will have to live by yourself in the other big house. Don't worry. I have a servant with me. Won't you miss me? Sure, I will. But that's how things should be. Grandson, you are a grown-up married man. Your responsibility is to take care of your wife. Okay, you two be happy. I'm going home now. Goodbye. Goodbye, Grandma. Yeah! This is awesome. This is my bed. Let go of me. My bed. Are you crazy? You are the one to get out of my bed. Get off. Ah, it hurts. Get off. Get off. What are you doing? You are the one to leave. Hey, let me remind you. Everything in this apartment belongs to me. You're right. But without me, you won't get your money. So you need me more than I need you. Wow! Are you fantasizing? If you want me to fulfill the contract. You have to agree to some more conditions. Otherwise. I will tell your grandma everything. Are you threatening me? Yes. First condition. You have to make me happy. Silence means yes. Do not dream. Second condition. I can add any condition any time. Be reasonable. Well, if you don't agree. I'm not happy. If I'm not happy, I will tell grandma. One more thing. You, go sleep outside. What? You go sleep outside. Okay, so you want it to be fair, right? Let's flip a coin to decide. Okay. If it's a number, I'll sleep in the bed. If it's a drawing, you will. Look carefully. One... Two... Three... Hello. Get up. Why are you still sleeping? Don't you forget our appointment with the lawyer? Damn it! I forgot. I'll be right there. This doesn't look real. No way. It's real. Let me send this to the police for verification. If it's fake. Long will loose his right to inherit, forever. And whoever created this document will be legally punished. Have to pay a fine from 250 to 2500 dollars. Be sentenced four to five years in prison. Bro, bro. I'll get the result very soon. It's unnecessary, lawyer. Let go of me. What are you doing? Please don't, lawyer. Let go of me. What are you doing? Please, it's unnecessary. Let go of me. What are you doing? Oh my God! What... Sorry Sir, he dialed the wrong number. It's Long's grandma. I'm listening, Madam. Yes, Madam. Yes. Yes, Madam. Congratulations, Long. You can get your grandma's money right now. But with one condition. What? You will only get it monthly. 25,000 dollars a month while you are still married. Then you will have to stay with your wife for a while. Is there any problem? No, monthly is fine. Congratulations. Daddy is listening. Yes. Where are you? I'm in Thailand, Dad. Is your work tough? No, it's very easy, Dad. I'm in the office now. What language is Linh speaking? Why do I hear her spitting only? That's Thai, Dad. Ah! I see. Take care of yourself, okay. Yes, Dad. I miss you lots. Sis Linh. I miss you too. I miss you too, little sis. Please don't make me cry. Dad, my boss is obnoxious. If he knows I'm talking to you at work. He will scold me. Then deduct my salary. Okay. Goodbye, Dad I'll call you back another time. We are just teasing each other. Grandma. You are so childish, Long. Please apologize to your wife. I'm sorry, honey. Long. I don't want Linh to work in Thailand anymore. Yes, Grandma. I want her to work with you. You two are married now. It's not good if one is here and the other is in Thailand. You two should live together and take good care of each other. That's a decision, okay? Look carefully. One. Two. Three. It's a number! That's not fair. Why not? We had a deal. It's a number, a number. You think you won? No way. I will go to a hotel. Ah, ghost! What ghost? It's Grandma. Grandma! You scared me! Why are you here at this hour? I came to give you an extra key. I forgot it this morning. Thanks, Grandma. Where are you going, carrying your back pack like this? Ah, I'm emptying the trash. It stinks. Hello Grandma. Hello, lovebirds. Can you see us clearly, Grandma? Today. I will train Long to fry fish. Huh? You have to slide it in slowly. Throwing it in like that, no wonder it's splashing everywhere. Here, do it again. Ah!!! No, you do it. I give up. I'll tell Grandma if you don't. Tell what? Grandma who? You! Who's calling me? Ah! Grandma. How come you're here? You were just in there… We were just teasing each other. Grandma. Get out! What are you looking at? Pervert! Ah, okay. Hey. What's this about? Why do you come in again? Get out. Why didn't you lock the door? The door was broken. I told you a while ago but you haven't fixed it. Really? Get out! Pervert! I hate you! How dare you "molesting" me! Bro, you can't do that. Listen to me. Bro! You call Uncle Hai, ask him to move the deadline two more weeks. I'm serious. God, he's gonna kill me. Should I call him so he can kill me then? But I've tried everything. You're so useless. Ms. Linh is waiting for you. Bro. Do I really have to see Uncle Hai? What are you doing here? Grandma wants me to work with you. You forgot? I think Grandma is suspecting us. If she finds out. Will I be arrested for complicity? God! I don't want to be put into prison. Please let me work with you. You are such a burden. Huh? Brother, Long will bring you the money. Bro. Stop. Help me, Long. Good. Until next time. Pervert. Are you okay? I feel like I have just been molested. Bro. You gave them all the money. Then how can we make the video clip? Maybe you should just tell Uncle Hai the truth. I have no solution. Are you crazy? But I can't think of any way out. I'm out. I'm not helping you anymore. Hung. How dare you talk to your boss like that? Please, Long. Hung is right. Shut up. What do you know? Ti fell and he's in the hospital now. Is he okay? The doctor said he needs a minor surgery. But we don't have money. Dad is speaking. Please don't worry. I will find a way. Just work well there. Dad. I know you're worried about me. But you are sick. My brother… till can't work. Where will you get the money for Ti's surgery? I will find a way to send you money for Ti's surgery. I'm so sorry. That you have to take care of our family too much. Don't worry, Dad. Your daughter can do everything. Goodbye, Dad. This guy doesn't speak Vietnamese, right? Yeah. I hate you. Linh doesn't like this guy. Neither do I. He comes to help us, Dad. Such an obnoxious man. Why'd he scold my daughter when she was just on the phone for a few minutes? I hate you! You're so cute. You're a hot boy. Now you tell me if he makes Linh cry one more time. I will pull his teeth out. This is difficult. Dad, I can't translate it. Speak Thai. You can speak Thai, right? That will not happen. Please don't worry. Why did you say he doesn't speak Vietnamese? There must be a misunderstanding here. I'm not obnoxious either. Ah, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Do you know why? Because Linh is our "heart". We love her so much. If anything happens to her, we won't survive. This is the first time Linh is away from home. So we are very worried about her. Please treat her well. Thank you for your help. Could you do me a favor please? Send Linh my hug. Please tell her we love her so much. Please take care of her for me. Ah, please do me one more favor. I miss her too. Please send her a kiss. What the heck? Ah, a hug is fine then. I talked to the doctor. Ti is fine. Thank you for helping my family. Ah, your Dad and your brother asked me for a favor. What is that? Send you this hug. Long. Hung. What did you say to Uncle Hai? I just told him the truth. Are you crazy? Too late. He said he won't work with us anymore. You. Son of a bitch. Long, please don't. You know I'm trying my best to finish the project. Calm down, Long. Stay away from me. Don't over try, boss. You. Long. Stay away from me. Why did you hit him? What do you know? Do you know how important this project is to me? But Hung is your cousin. He just wanted to help you. Help my ass. He just destroyed it. You too. I… What? You don't need to follow me around. Piss off. I've never seen him that angry, Grandma. I know. I understand his feelings. He just wanted to prove his ability to his father. That's why he has to do the project no matter what. His father is a famous director. He is Long's idol since he was small. His father was like a hero to him. Long also loves him the most. Shut up. Don't say anything. Stay away from me. Please think about your family. One year later, his mother died. He blamed everything on his father. But the fact that people fall out of love and break up is normal, Grandma. But kids don't know that. Long still hold a grude until now. There. Those are the birthday presents his father sends him every year. He refused them all, Grandma? Yeah. He doesn't care. Always grumpy. Not like him at all. I know the first steps are always the hardest. But I will support you. I will always be by your side and never leave you. I thought you left for good? I don't have money to compensate for terminating the contract. I always wanted to be better than my father. He has the ability... to make people believe in love, that happiness is eternal. But actually. All those are fake. Just like you and me? Sorry. I'm sorry for raising my voice at you. It's okay. My Mom taught me and my brothers That whoever knows how to say sorry will become a better person. That means you have become a much better person. Congratulations. What if Uncle Hai is still mad? Please, don't be silly. If you show him your sincerity and determination. I'm sure he will understand. Come on. Let's do it. I have no reason to justify my mistakes. Everything was my fault. I totally understand If you won't give me another chance. But. If you still trust me. I promise I will do my best. Uncle Hai… Gave me a second chance. - Yeah! - Really? Thank you. Look. Why did you suddenly… hug me? This is a hug… from Uncle Hai. Are you acting? It's the truth. I'm sorry. It was just a slip of my tongue the other day. Please come back to work for me. Is that all you can say? Ugh. Hung. Please, I'm sorry. Okay. I forgive you. But returning to work… You have to give me a raise. Happy co-operation.

So I will be qualified for your inheritance. Grandma. I will be responsible for all the mistakes that I made. You don't need to apologize. No, Grandma.

I agreed with Grandma, Because my family really needed money then. I'm sorry. Grandma and I wanted to stop. But we haven't found a chance to tell you. Why is that? I'm so sorry, grandson. Please don't get mad at Linh. This is all my fault. But everything I did was because I want good things for you. I believed it was real. I was so happy and I even thought that, You would agree to be my wife. Long. Me cheating you was real, But I was really happy when I was with you. Please stop. Do you think I can trust you one more time? Long. Do you know that this is the first time I ever believed that something was real. Congratulations though. You are a good actress.

I heard from Uncle Hai that he was so proud of your latest project. Really? And he wants to sign a long term contract with you. That's great! Long. The one you need to thank is not Uncle Hai. But... Your father. It's your father who asked Uncle Hai to give you the second chance. Why standing here, son? I… I'm sorry, Dad. Me too. I'm sorry for everything. Until now. He still makes me laugh. Of course you have to be honest with your life partner. It's the most stable foundation For a long term relationship. Love always has to base on honesty. No matter if we are rich, or poor. Sick or healthy. I will still be by his side. I hope that you will believe in love. Please give love a chance to fall in love and forgive people. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Lottery tickets, uncle. Hello? Hey, we need some extras to play a family. So I think of you, babe. Thank you. Any special requirement? Sure: an old father. An older brother with a casted arm. A younger sister and little brother. Wow, sounds exactly like my family. This is written for your family. Lucky you, what else do you want? Okay, it's a deal. 7 PM tonight. Be on time. Hang up then I'll text you the address. Dad. Our family have an acting gig tonight. Acting? Yeah! Ugh. My legs hurt. Is this the right address, Linh? Yes, it is. Why is it so dark here? Maybe we will act in a ghost movie? Don't scare me. Just follow Linh. We came here to work. Come on. Hello. May I…? Let's go. Linh. It's the wrong address. Let's go, Dad. Linh. Don't you want to apologize to Long too? I... Long, I… I'm sorry for hurting you. Please forgive me. Goodbye. Linh. Listen to me please. Before... Love was just a game for me. But since I met you, I changed my mind. Thank you for everything. The time I spent with you is the happiest days of my life. Linh. Will you marry me one more time? I just adjusted one thing in the contract. What do you want me to do? No, it's just the term of the contract is forever. One… two… three! I will get married this year!
