LILY WAS HERE Flashy jobs we have. 7.95 You must have eaten something from the shop. Or is it you know what? I've missed two periods. -I was just talking nonsense. Seriously? By who? Not by that... That's just great. You can take a pill to get rid of it. I'm going to America with him, to Minneapolis. Do you want to keep it? Do your parents know? They'll be overjoyed. I can't make them happy anyway. I don't care. And he cares about me. Yeah, right, that's what they all say. But all they want is... -Yes, with you. I'm talking to you! I'm your mother! You're staying in tonight. Did you hear me? Open that door! Don't be embarrassed because of me. I want to get away from here, Alan. I think Americans are much nicer. I don't know what to say. Maybe you just got me zwanger? -Zwanger, what's that? Don't you want to know why she's this late? Some mother you are. If she were my daughter... You don't have a daughter. -No, thank God. Well? -She's still a child. She's just been out with the girls. -With that brown foreigner. Or did you think your daughter was different? They're not all American soldiers in that disco. Local boys go there too. -But they don't have a big... She's still in the kitchen. The guys at the slaughterhouse are very pissed off. They don't stand a chance against those coons. Lily would never do that. She knows she can't come home with one of those foreigners. Another fucking negro. Making an international call? The phone counter's going like crazy. Since when do you pay anything here? We've known each other for half a year. We were going to go to America. I bet you'll say you were at Helen's. Well, we called and you weren't there. So you weren't there! But she did say... She said... She said you puked at work. And that you said you were pregnant. Couldn't you have thought about us, for once? What are you drinking? I know someone who can help you. We'll pay for it. It's done in no time and it doesn't hurt. Lily? Don't tell me it's by one of those... You're not that stupid, are you? What does it matter if you want to have it removed? We could have spent that money on something else. Under 18 you can only get... -But I'm having a baby. If we could contact your parents... I don't want my mother to know where I am. You can get 600 guilders from us. It's not a problem. Just a vacuum clean. Problem solved. I've had it done twice already. Yuck, coffee! You've been here quite a while. You're not from the city. You're quite right. No one lives here for fun. Are you taking the last train? Can I get two white wines. Ice? Ice! Never mind. You must have better things to do with your money. Add that too, please. Here. Do you often go to the city? -Sometimes. Do you like it here? -Sometimes. 17.50. -Here. Have a night out with this. -Thank you. Problems at home? Are you sure? People just don't leave you alone anymore. Take me. I think everybody should do what they feel like. As long as they don't bother you. Each to their own, right? What time does the last train leave? -At ten past. Ten past. It was nice talking to you. Bye. Missed the last train? Are you staying here all night? I don't know where to go. That's a pity. Cut off. You could have called home otherwise. Doesn't anybody live here? Isn't it strange? Beautiful apartments but nobody wants to live there. People are strange creatures, don't you think? But where do you live, sir? Just call me Ted. I have a nice house. I just rent these out for tax reasons. Here. -That much... I can't... While you live here, it won't be squatted. That makes us even. Make yourself at home. This is for the trip back. Little girls don't belong in the city. Arend? Had any checks? That's a change. Where do you get this glop? There. Cab? Evening out? Nice bar, nightclub, live show? When I need a cab, I'll call one. You'll pay double, jerk. You have to warm them up a bit. When they see your face... Ok. A girl moved in above you again. This one?s here to stay. From the station, no problem. She came to me and asked if I have work for her. Look at the road, please. And what do I do with her? The same as always. Start by being nice. Then we'll see. When I'm doing well, you're doing well. Right? They call this al dente. I call it al porridge. Loni! Loni! Loni! Loni doesn't live here anymore. Where is she then? -Why don't you come in with me? Missing since 2 months: Lilly Mertens. Age 17. 1m68, black hair, pregnant. Tattoo on right shoulder (little elephant). Have you changed your mind? What do you mean? -Weren't you only here for a few days? He said I could stay until I'd found something. But everything's much too expensive. Does he give you money? -Sometimes. But he'll get it all back. I understand that. Did you say four months? I think 5 months or a bit over. You can get dressed. How old are you? 21. Married or living together? Living together. Do you want to give birth at home? -I don't know yet. Do you have National Health Insurance? How are you insured? I pay cash. Do you know what it costs? A thousand guilders? Much more if you have to go to hospital. I'll find a solution. Are there any hereditary problems in your boyfriend's family? No. -Did you forget to take the pill? No. -You can always come to me for help. How big is it? Like this. A bit bigger than a peach. -A peach. I was waiting for you. And so was Emile. And Emile doesn't like that. Right, Emile? You didn't say too much. You don't have to be afraid. I'll be very sweet to you. Only if you do as I say. Ok. Very good. Don't touch my belly! -Ok. Harder. Feels better. Better than Loni. Alright, because she's pregnant. See? It's not so bad. This is how we help each other. Now I owe you one. Just let me know. This is good business. I swear! Men of a certain age dig those young girls. Exactly the types with money. She does it anyway and this way it pays. Good for all of us. That's how they are. I just give the people what they want. As long as I get my money, I'm happy. All my customers use your cab, so you profit from the business too. Talking about business. I just got a 100 extra upstairs. What do you mean? Pregnant. The guy loved it. Pregnant! They all want to get a girl like that pregnant. That's business for you. Loni! I know you're there. I'm not her! I've told you a hundred times to stay away from here. The other girl's gone and don't touch this one. Go away! Now! Let go of me. The child's alright. Don't worry about that. Where was your boyfriend when it happened? He wasn't there. I don't have a boyfriend. You're not 21. You didn't fall of the stairs. You're homeless, you have no money and your boyfriend doesn't want the child. I'll find someone else. -Yes, I think that's better. At least I think of the child. You don't. Why don't you just talk to me? Who's the father then? He's dead. I wanted to go to America with him. That's why you want the child so much. It's the first time something's really mine. Sometimes I think I feel something. But then I don't feel it anymore. You first need to know what you should feel. Is that him? -No, that's you. This is him. I'm calling about that girl. I worry about her. The child's still small. Yes, it's mature. Do you really think so? What would you advise? Yes, that would be best. Ok, thanks. I'm looking for a room. -Just for you? For how long? -A week. 25 a day. Is ten ok too? Leave your bag here and pay the rest tomorrow. Room 2. What are you doing? For four days. My bag. I only wanted... Filthy asshole! Come on! Fuck off! With no money! You're the hottest when you're angry. Why did you come back? Sorry. -And now what? I want to go home. -What do you mean? I live in a hotel. -A hotel? I don't understand what the hell you're all doing. As long as I stay out of it... I get customers in my car and I drive them to one of Ted's houses. That's how I make my money. So you help him? Nice work you do. I didn't know you were pregnant yet. You worked for Ted, didn't you? -I've never worked for him. What about that tape? It was so important that... Yes, it belongs to my boyfriend. -Oh, boyfriend. He split with someone else and this is the only thing you have of him. He's dead. It's his child. Nobody wants me to have it. Can I do anything? Do you want to eat something? Do you have any olives? I don't think so. I really had it. I had just gone to the bank. There are plenty of foreigners here and they steal like magpies. But if you have no more money, you can get lost. You're right, I'm not alone. Hurry up. I could ask the cook to make you something. No, thanks. -Shall I get you another pillow? No, I'll be fine, thanks. Is anything wrong? No. Hey, sweetheart. Have you heard how they treat us? Isn't it nice? They think we're very rich. Are you kicking? Take it easy. You have to behave here. See the head... and the legs... and the hands. Isn't it beautiful? Can you see if it's a boy or a girl? What do you want? First a girl. And if it's a boy? You'll call him Alan. Six months. Have you lost any blood lately? No. Is anything wrong? You don't need to worry, but the baby's small. Is that dangerous? Generally not, if you have the baby in hospital. What will you do now? Wait. Until the next junk robs me? What do you want me to do? Walk through the city with a picture? Show this to all the midwives. One of them has to know her. That tattoo turns me on, you know? NEED MONEY? personal loan Please come in. This is the girl. Eight months pregnant? I don't have any girls of that age. Never seen pregnant women before? -No. There are several witnesses. Excuse me. Conny Meiering's practice. I'm in pain and there's blood in my bed. Can you come? No, can you come here? I can't leave now. Take a cab. You'll be here quickly. It's hard to believe. Anyway, I can't help you. I have an emergency so you have to go. -Thanks. Bye. Could you please help me? Why aren't you saying anything? I thought you'd like to see me again. Why else did you give me your number? -Not to play cab driver for you. Take it easy. Are you alright? -Yes. Really? A little elephant. Yes, that's correct. We found baby stuff in her room. I don't want to interfere, but... Very good of you. We'll be there. Make sure nobody enters the room. Lily, it's not serious. They're practice contractions and they made you lose blood. It's normal. It just means the baby will come soon. The police were here just now. They're looking for you. Your picture's in all the papers. Doesn't matter. I want to have the child abroad anyway. Aren't there better ways to get money than robbing a bank? Armed! Are there? How? I didn't do it for myself. It'll be hard enough to have the child on your own. Why? I want you to take this against anaemia. How much? -3.75. Does it have anything? Show me. Doesn't look like me. Does it? What's wrong? Don't you think I'm pretty? Why aren't you saying anything? Are you angry too? How long will that money last? No idea. I haven't even counted it yet. It's still in my hotel room. Found anything? No weapons? Take it to the station. Started for yourself? Get out. Out of my own apartment? Make a suggestion, a percentage. Then we all win. I said get out. Well? Do you want me to tell them where she is? It wasn't about you. You can't go out like this anymore. They'll arrest you right away. Cut it the way you like it. Is that your girlfriend in the picture? -Which picture? In the kitchen cupboard. Do you still see her? I found a necklace in the flat. In the shape of a snake. Just like in... -She once started working for Ted too. In the flat where you were. Do you still love her? She couldn't handle it anymore. Overdose. I took her to hospital. But she never came out again. Does this look better on me? At least they won't recognise you anymore. But do you like it better? What matters is that they're looking for you. What does that matter? They won't catch me anyway. They know who you are because of that photo. They only don't know you're here. You have no money to go away and you'll have to go to hospital to deliver. I still have the 2000 guilders. That gets you half an afternoon in hospital, third class. I can get money anywhere. As long as I'll cross the border. But first you'll have to get across. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. You're just afraid, like all the others. When I walk in somewhere with an unloaded gun, they give me their money. Do they? I used to be afraid of them. Now they're afraid of me. Would you have done it without a child too? And you're proud of that? It's not true what I said. I'd never have done it without a child. Is that little elephant real? They care the most about each other. Why would that girl do something like this? For her baby? I don't even think she's pregnant. All that didn't lead to anything. But if she is pregnant, we have to check all the hospital deliveries. You can't let that go. 20 to 1. No, I'll stay here a bit longer. No, there's no one waiting for me. You just go home. Lily? CHRISTMAS CREDIT FOR THE YOUNG FAMILY I've come to get your Christmas credit. Shall I call you a doctor? Maybe my colleague can help... Lily? Come. I'll be right back. Come on now! Good. Very good. Breathe deeply. Good. Relax a moment. Push, push! Push... push! And push. One more time. One more time. It's a girl. Please, come on. Come on. We have to go to hospital right away. You know we're looking for your daughter? She's not here. Mind if I sit down? She's had a baby. So I read. So she hasn't been here anymore? She's no longer welcome here. I've done everything for her. I've always been alone. For her! And what for? For nothing! Where?s the child now? -In hospital. Under surveillance. There's no need for that. She won't come for the child. I know what she's like. It's not our fault. Lily? -What did Conny say? Everything's alright. They just want to keep her for a couple of days. Then I'll go get her today. The place is crawling with police. They won't get me. How will you get to the child? Conny will help. And then what? Abroad, by train. -What about the border? There's no border with Belgium. -Oh, stop it. Do you want me to leave my child in hospital? Of course not, but you always overdo things. Why don't you help me instead? You want me to abandon my child and just leave. You're a coward and you only think of yourself. Get lost. Sorry, you're the only one who can get me out of this. Without you, they would already have arrested me. I wish they had. Lily! I changed the names of the babies. Her name's now Anneloes. Be careful. Thanks. Hey, sweetheart. Come. Hello. -Hello. You have to be really quiet now. Damn! Hello. I would have seen her. Are you looking for someone? Stop her! Stop her!
