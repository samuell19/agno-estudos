What? You wanted to run away? There's nowhere to run. Nowhere. "This story began three months ago." "I was still working in the Opera house at the time," "and we were all waiting for the arrival of the great Sofia Maier". You know that Golovin will never give me the part. I really want Sophia to hear me. I want her to judge my voice. Please. Give me a chance, I beg you. "Sophia Maier the famous opera singer," "the best mezzo-soprano of our time." "Twenty-seven years ago, she fled from the Soviet Union," "and now for the first time she was returning home" "to stage Queen of spades in our theatre." "The great, incomparable Sofia Maier," "an eccentric diva." "Maria Callas of our days." "People flew across the ocean just to hear her sing Norma in Chicago." Wait a minute, I feel awkward. - It'll be alright. Go to her now. - Sofia, Sofia! - Go, go. - Sofia! Sofia! - Sofia! - Are you Lisa? Get in the car. Then we'll talk. Get in, get in, get in. Love you, Sofia! - So you hate me. - Yes, I do. It's because of you that she lost her voice. You've completely ruined our lives, don't you see? I hate you. What you're talking about is called destiny. One breaks one's voice, another sings, and is applauded by the entire world. She sang better than you. Well, of course. How about if I took you under my wing to make you the world's next great opera singer? No, thank you. I'll manage without your help. "Ladies and gentlemen, I've been asked to introduce someone..." - Here on the right. - I remember. "Sofia Andreyevna Maier!" My dears, I'm home. It was right here that my life began. I first took to the stage in this theater. - It was on this same stage... - Yeah. That I sang Lisa in the Queen of spades. Yeah. Do you see how radiant Golovin is? He's happy that he'll sing Hermann at the pre-retirement age. He won't. She will never give her approval. Wanna bet? I'm sure that you all know my niece. Lisa Galickaya. Lisa, stand up. Stand up. Let me tell you a little secret about how my niece was named. After Lisa from the Queen of spades. And that's why she will be singing the part of Lisa in my next production. And as for me, due to my advanced age, I will happily perform the part of the Countess. And Hermann will be sung... by your artistic director... laureate of various prizes, the wonderful Seva Golovin. Surprise. Surprise, surprise. Well, what did I say? "I don't know his name." As they say, the casting is open. Other roles are vacant. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck! - Do you live here? - I live nowhere. - I am always a guest. - Whose house is this? His, as you can see. So you haven't gone bankrupt yet. No, but I'm still trying to. I see you have a lot of luggage. Yes. Oh, you've turned it over, you monsters! - Where are you dragging it? - And you're Lisa, right? Yes. Welcome. When I was a little boy, I wanted to have a big house. And now I have it. So you really live here? I know. When there is no sun, it`s gloomy. - But we have a swimming pool. - Hmm. Do you want to swim? Take me back to town, please. I can't. She'll kill me. Your aunt is a terrific woman. But she can kill easily. Thank you for the warning. Are you her lover? Her husband? God forbid. Then who are you? I'm just Oleg. Actually, I'm lying. I know who you are. You're the head of the Board of Trustees, and you raise money to fund Sofia's plays. So you're a patron of the arts. Do you love music? Not really. Then why raise money? I actually hate it. It's her thing. She dominates me and inspires me. I already understood that she can do that. The one and the other. Sofia! Sofia! Don't be afraid. Let me introduce you to my girls. Madame Butterfly. And here's Carmen. Looks like me? Are you hauling them all over the world? Well, of course. It's better than news clippings. These clothes and wigs, they give me the energy and the emotion what I want to express. And here's a gift for you. It's Lisa's costume. I designed it myself. And then I sang in all the theatres of the world just wearing it. And you will sing in it too. When you put it on, you will feel. - I'll feel what? - Power. I have something else for you. - No, it's not for me. - It belonged to your mother. My mother had no jewelry. None at all. I bought this for your mother. I just never gave it to her. - Hello. - Hey. I barely got out of the forest. I flagged down a car. Do you want a drink? What's this? She gave it to me. Look, Lisa. How about if we drink to your shiny necklace? - Okay. - You know what's cool about it? Don't you? The diamonds, they are, they are hard, harder than anything else. I called you. Why didn't you answer? Because my phone got broken. - How did it break? - It happened very simply. You see, it found itself smashed against the wall. I think you're drunk! - No. - Yes. - No. - You got drunk. I'm not drunk. So, Lisa, let's talk about the Queen of spades. - Okay - Lisa loves Hermann? - Hmm? - Hermann is a scoundrel. He's not a scoundrel. Why do you say that? He just wants to win at cards. We guys, we're just simple guys. No money, no relatives. Let us at least win at cards! But he broke her heart. Then he is a total prick! - I never would have done that. - No? - Never. I'd never do that. - You're a scoundrel. "Oh, my Lisa!" - "Oh my scoundrel!" - "Lisa!" - "They've posted the cast list." - "What is it?" Everyone is in, everyone. And I'm not. - I'm not even in the supporting cast. - Andrey, everything will be fine. No, Lisa. It won't. This bastard Golovin, he purposely took me to the theatre just to torment me. - He will never let me sing! - Wait! I have to sing Hermann. This is my role. - Where are you going? - Business. - Just do uncover. - Yeah, I see. What should I call your uncle? Nothing. David Georgievich. - David Georgievich? - Yes. What if doesn't work this time? I'm not a robot. It'll work. They bet some serious money on you. - And your uncle as well? - Him too. You weren't kidding. Wow! If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't believe it. - Trick? - Talent. Damn It! - Have you seen The Voice show? - I have. Well, he's like them. Talent is the most precious thing. If you have any problems, come see me. You like it? It's for you. "I don't know what's wrong with me" "I'm lost!" "I am indignant at the weakness but can control myself no more" - "You're in love..." - Stop, stop, stop! Thank you. Seva, dear, what are you doing?" What do you mean what I am I doing? - What's wrong with your hands? - What? My hands are alright. It's not a bullfight. And Hermann is not a bullfighter. Well, with all due respect, my hero lived in the nineteenth century and... In the nineteenth century, Seva, there also lived normal people. Alive, normal people. What is Queen of Spades about? It's a story about money. It's about what we care about most in the world. Oh! I think Tchaikovsky would have disagreed with that. It's about youth, about passion, about sex. Seva, this is about sex. They are young people. They want to live so much they get screwed up. They get high as they say now. To be honest, I don't feel good today. - Do you have a cold? - My throat. Well, let's stop for now. You have a rest, and then we'll continue later. - Alright then, in an hour. - Let's do it tomorrow. It's better tomorrow. - Well, then see you tomorrow. - Yes. - Get well soon, please. Get well. - I'll be on my way. Thank you. Thank you. - Well, are we done? - Yes, we're done. Thank you all. Unfortunately, the rehearsal is over. Oh, it's a nightmare! Are you okay? Listen, we'll have dinner at eight. Wear an evening dress and bring your... What's his name? Andrey, yes, bring him. We'll take a look at him. Andrey, why are you so silent? I don't know what to say. - May I sing for you? - We're having dinner. You do better to talk. Tell them about your voice. - Is there a story about it? - It's a very interesting story. As a child, Andrey almost drowned. Oh God! How dramatic! He fell down an ice hole. Some boys pushed him on to the ice of a frozen pond - when he was eight years old. - I was twelve years old. - It's twelve. - Yeah. And what happened next? - "They were chasing me." - He's running away! - "I was running away." - Get him, Let's go! And then the ice cracked and I fell into the water. But you got out alive. Well, as you can see. You tell it the wrong way. "The bullies drove him like a beast." "He fell into a hole in the pond, right with his head under the ice." And a miracle happened. His vocal cords completely closed up. - Sorry? - A miracle. The water was so cold that his vocal cords closed and that's how he got his unique voice. Fantastic! Were you scared? To drown in the icy water? I don't know, I was clinically dead for eight minutes. Amazing. What is amazing? Clinical death? The way Lisa looked at you just now. Andrey, do you mean you drowned, and then after that, your vocal chords closed up, then you died, then you resurrected, and then as a result you found your unique voice. Yes. It's a good story. No, really, Andrey, it's a great story. - You don't believe it? - What difference does it make if I believe it or not? A ready-made interview. I advise you to tell it as often as possible to journalists. Especially the broadcasters. Oh, they'll love it! Why did they want to beat you up? There had to be some reason. I don't know. Maybe because I was smaller and weaker. I believe that. They always do that. Excuse me. I hope you like it. Very much. Sofia Andreyevna! Sofia Andreyevna! I wanted to tell you that you are a great singer. But you made a mistake with the main role. I should be singing the part of Hermann I am him, I am Hermann. Would you please just give me this one chance? Just listen to my voice, and you will understand. "Oh, have pity!" "I'm dying and bearing you my plea" "Look from the heights" "Of heavenly paradise..." "On mortal fight." Sofia Andreyevna. It's my role. Do you understand me? Do you understand? Do you understand? You don't understand anything. Well, here it is... - Your famous hat. - Yes, it brings me luck. - Let's go. - Where are we going? You'll see. Get in. - What about Andrey? - Andrey will be taken home. Andrey, thank you for a rally lovely evening. You do look quite a bit like Hermann. - Where are we going? - Follow them. - Follow them? - Yes. - Easy, you're not allowed in. - Why? - Because. - They're expecting me. - Who is? - Oleg. - I don't know any Oleg. - Oleg is my friend. He's waiting for me. He just went in with Sofia. No one went in. now leave. - Let me in, they're waiting for me. - Get out. Let me in. They're waiting for me. Damn it! That's enough. Get out of here. Fuck you! Open the door. I know you're in there. Open the door. Ah, it's you. Well, hello. Baglay said you were dangerous. Is it true? No. Here. He had this. - Loaded? - It's loaded. It was given to me recently. And I took it with me. You can keep it if you want it. I don't need it. I'd better go. Wait. You've struggled so much to get in here. I'll take you on a little tour. What is this? A casino? Yes, it is. - Whose is it? - Mine. Its ex-owner wanted to build a theater here. I always wanted to have my own casino. Now it's illegal, but I really wanted it. It's a simple idea. A supermarket with common people upstairs, and a casino for the elite downstairs. I'll give you some advice. Don't stare at my guests. They don't like being stared at when they're playing. Your winnings. Vasiliy, for you. Thank you. Why are you here? To kill you, I think. Here. We found it on him. Be careful. It's loaded. To kill me? Or you were gonna kill yourself? You really do look like Hermann. Do you want to play? Do you have money? - I do. - How much? Not much. Forty-seven thousand dollars. I can't believe it. You're just like Hermann. Yes, the one was also considered a poor man, but he came and he took out a check for forty-seven thousand dollars. That was a lot of money at that time. I've been saving up. I denied myself everything. Then do you have something to stake? Are you afraid of losing? I am not afraid. I just don't have the money with me. Well, then let me buy you your gun, alright? - Stop it, Sophia, stop it! - I want to buy his gun! Leave me alone, will you? Just don't bother me! How much is this gun worth? Hmm? Vasio, how much is this gun worth? Oh my God! Okay, five hundred. Six Hundred! That's it. What? Seven hundred! Take it. Now you can bet. I don't play. Oh, what a loser! Hermann would have played. Though you're no match for Hermann. In those days people shot one another because of unfortunate or fortunate love, or just because of the fullness of their hearts. They were not afraid to risk it all. Go. Go ahead and spin. Andrey? What happened? Are you hurt? Wait a second. You're bleeding. You need to go to a hospital! Leave me alone. - Your last bets. - I'll play. - Play then. - Spin it. Thank you. No more bets. Seventeen black. - Did I win? - No, you lost. Andrey! Where are we going? To a hospital. Stop, pull over. Please stop the car now. Stop right here. Look, you're not doing well. I'm not? No. I'm fine. I'm totally fine, Lisa. I finally understood it all. You need to go to the hospital. I'm unlucky because I have no money. And I have no money because I have no luck. And that's why I don't sing the part of Hermann. Poor people! They're interesting to no one. Why? Because they have no money. And therefore no luck. That's how it is. But you can't understand it, Lisa, because you're there with all of them on the other side now. You're talking nonsense. Well, how much is this worth? Huh? I don't know. Give it to me. Hmm? - I can't do that. - Why not? - it's a gift. - So what? Do you love me? Give it to me if you do. Do you love me? Give it to me. - Are you crazy? - Come on, give it to me. Give it to me. Oh! So now we know just how much you love me. What is it? I won the lottery. I guess I was lucky. You're mistaken. I won it. That's my ticket, right? And the hamburger is mine, and I'm the lucky one. Got it? You know what? Fuck you!. You can choose whatever you want. Another 500 on black. Sorry, but you have no more chips. On credit. Our establishment does not give credit. Oleg, tell him. - Vasiliy. - Vasya, give me two hundred dollars in credit. You asshole. Then pull out from your pocket the chips I tipped you with. Get them out. Come on. I'm betting two hundred on black. Come on. That way you can proudly tell your children you lent money to Sofia Maier. - Come On! - I'll fire him. You really got me. Why do you always have to spoil the party? Why do you do that? Where's my whiskey? Because you are already banned from entering every casino in Europe. Because you never stop until you lose everything. And just why do you care? You think I've got no money? You really think that? Look. Vasiliy. We'll cash it. That's all you got left after selling your house in Paris? Yes. That's all I have left from the sale of my home in Paris. - You'll get it tomorrow. - Give it back. - It'll be better. - Give it back. It's my money! Give it back! Give it back to me! You bastard, give it to me. Easy, easy. Easy. Oleg, I love you so much. You're my brother. Such a brother to me. Such a brother, straight brother so harsh. That's it. That's it. - Let's go home to sleep now. - Okay. Wait, I got this thing, and I still have my pouch. - Wait. - They'll bring it. I'll be back tomorrow, Vasiliy. Don't you forget. "Whence are these tears, why should they be?" "My girl's dreams you betrayed me." "My girlish dreams" "You betrayed me!" You're pushing too much. I'm Sorry, I can't help it. Thank you. Lisa, what's going on? You had a fight with Andrey? Forget him, he's nobody. Well, not nobody. It doesn't matter. What are you afraid of all the time? Of you. Great. What else? I have no talent. Come here. She's got no talent. Stand right here on your knees in front of the mirror. Hug yourself. Tight, like this. And now give me a Russian woman deep cry, a howl, a howl. Come on. Come on, from deep inside, a howl. Deep in here, right here. Scream deep. No, there's no energy. No way. We need enough energy that'll fill a hall with four thousand people. Come on, from in here and remember that feeling. Let's take a twenty minute break. Thank you. They all swear they love me but nobody wants to work. - What's that? - Money. I want to play. And the flowers? Never give flowers that are all wrapped up. How much money is there? Forty-seven thousand dollars. How much will you stake? Everything. - What shall we play? - Pharaoh. As Hermann played. No one has played Pharaoh for ages. - Well, you can try. - How do you play? You haven't done your homework. A whole deck of cards are laid out on the table face up. You have to bet money on one of them. Then the croupier starts to deal out cards from his deck. One card to the left, another to the right. If your card is laid on the left, you win. If it's on the right, you lose. It's simple. You don't need to think. It's pure luck. Hermann didn't rely on just luck. He asked the countess the three winning cards. Three, seven, and ace. I will bet on the three. A great choice. Go ahead. The bank is on the right. The player on the left. - Cut it? - Huh? That's it. The three is out. Did I lose? You've won. Forty-seven thousand dollars. Congratulations. So then, can I collect my winnings? Go ahead, pay him. Please. Your winnings. Oh! To keep luck going. Congratulations, we have received the first costumes. - Wonderful! - With luck, we'll get the sets too. Good morning to all of you, and... Where is Seva? I ask, where is Golovin? - Yes. - He's got a throat infection, and he went to the doctor. Elvira? He said he had a sore throat. And why am I hearing about this after the rehearsals have already started? Elvira, what do you think you're doing? It is your responsibility. I don't have the artist of the main part. To the devil with it all. I'm not going to cancel the rehearsal. Can any of you sing the part of Hermann today? I'll do it. "I don't know her name and don't want to know..." "not to call her with the earthly name." "Fingering all the comparisons," "I don't know to whom can I compare." "My love, the bliss of Paradise," "I'd like the to keep it for ages!" That's all, thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, let's wait for the applause at the premiere. Well, it's not bad. Your breathing is a disaster, but you intone pretty well. Let's start the rehearsal again. Straight from the summer garden. Ladies and gentlemen, on the stage please. Do you have anything to drink? Yes. Cognac. It's home-made. Gagik gave it to me. It's Armenian. Who is Gagik? Huh? Gagik? My neighbor. He's also a fan of yours because of me. It's strange to find yourself in your own mausoleum when you're still alive. And where did you get these? I was only 14 then. Go away. Just drink your cognac and go away. You're already throwing me out of the mausoleum? So quickly? Why did you come here? To mock me, is that right? It's so easy. You're right. I am a loser. But I managed to do what no one before me was able to do. And that was to become the real Hermann. Do you believe me? Believe me. - I want to play. - Why? You already won a lot of money. But I want to make some serious money. I want to win a million at Oleg's casino. Hermann lost the third time. Yeah, but I'm better than Hermann. Sofia Maier? Oh, my gosh! You're Sophia Maier, the great opera singer. I'm Gagik, Andrey's friend. Hello. You mean the supplier of the home-made cognac? Well, almost. It's my grandfather who sends it from the Caucasus. - And it's your car? - It's mine. What a classy car! It's a Rolls-Royce Phantom V, from 1963. - So you know about cars? - Of course. I used to drive very cool cars. But none like this one, to be perfectly honest with you. By the way, if you decide to sell it, here's my uncle's card. He's a very serious person. - Auto services? - Yeah. - Well, thank you. - See you. Listen, Gagik, is it true that Andrei fell through the ice when he was a child? - Yes. - How do you know that? How do I know? I pulled him out. As I told you, I'm his best friend. "So you're pronouncing my death sentence." "O God! I'm going weak." "Go, I beg of you!" "Then better tell me to die!" - "Oh, heavens above!" - "Farewell!" "No!" "Live on!" "My beauty! My goddess!" "My angel!" - "I'm forever yours!" - "You are mine forever!" Andrei, you lose all the energy in the pauses. Hold them. Hold them, do not let go. On the contrary, accumulate the sense, the meaning at that time. Your breathing and pauses are as much a part of the music as well. They must all be felt like notes. - And me? - We'll talk about you later. Look, why did I put you in this cage? So that you couldn't reach each other physically. See, you do it with your body and I need you to sing it. Now sing from this cage. Sing it! I'll remove it later, but it will stay with your singing. Do I sing badly? You don't sing badly, but you can sing much better. We're talking about meaning. Can we take a break for a while? I'm a bit tired. All right, let's take a break. A break? Take a rest. You have nothing to say to me? To be honest, no. I've been talking to you for two months, but you wouldn't listen. Are we going to be rehearsing together? Why? You don't wanna look or even be like me. And I sometimes think that you don't even want to be a singer. Or you can't. Wait! What are you wearing? The dress in which you played Lisa twenty years ago. That's why it looks so old. You wanted me to sing in it. Well, it hangs on you like a curtain. We'll show your legs. There, that's much better. Take this. "The second game was awaiting me." "Three, seven, ace." "I bet on seven." "And walked away with 180,000 dollars." For luck. And now, am I Hermann? Well, you look great. So, what did the doctor say? It's been two months. Is this a war? I'm the one to blame? What should I have blamed myself for? Interesting. You know, my dear, I can simply dismiss you for health reasons. My contract is with the theatre, not with you. Yeah, you know how to complain. You, Seva, are a vile pig. You've turned the great Tchaikovsky's opera into a farce, kitsch! It's so beautiful, Seva! You're a fortunate man. With a nice house. And you won so many awards... but you're missing the most important one, right? You want a Golden Voice? I'm on the jury this year. And who's gonna sing Hermann? That milksop? That nonentity? That will never happen. I have to take care of the theatre's reputation. You better take care of your voice, Seva. Don't catch a chill. Please listen, this performance will be a huge success; I promise you. And you'll get a golden statuette. Yes, by the way. Do you know why I'm here? Why? I was at Golovin's. So? - Did you make up? - No. We didn't make up. But we reached an agreement. And? And? You'll sing Hermann. Am I Hermann? Well, you have a chance. No, no. No, no, leave me. You better bring me that monstrous cognac. - Or bring me some water. - Water? Mm-hmm. No, better bring cognac and water. - Oh, and do you have jam? - Yes. Then bring the jam. Why are you naked? - Where is Sophia? - I'm here, Lisa. Sophia has arranged it. I'll sing the part of Hermann. Is that all you want to tell me? What does one say in such situations? Do you want us to tell you that- that we love each other? No. Don't. I hate both of you! I don't want anything from you. Take it back! Take it! These diamonds are fake, you see! Oh! They're fake! They're fake! Are they the ones you kept for mom for twenty years? You're a real whore! Whore! Come here. It's true that I bought a diamond necklace for her mother, but I couldn't give it to her. Then I pawned it. And this is just glass. Oh! Shit. What happened? Are you hurt? Does it hurt? Where? There's nothing. Nothing. I'll return your necklace to you. I'll win a million from your Oleg, and I'll return it to you. Can I help you? I have a baseball bat. You want it? I hate her. I really hate her. And I'm afraid for you. Do you know how your mother lost her voice? She and Sophia sang a duet. I was there that day, at a rehearsal. I was in love with both of them, I was a poor student. Sophia kept going higher and higher, and your mother... she lost her voice. Then Sophia replaced her with another singer on tour, and stayed there. Perhaps I shouldn't have told you all this. I'm afraid that she's trying to do with you what she did with your mother. I feel that I'm different. I don't want to step over any bodies. I don't want anyone to suffer because of me. I don't wanna be a star. Well, don't fool yourself. Everybody wants that. And you want it, too. Now, now. "He could never commit a crime." - "Could never..." - Stop! - "commit a crime..." - Stop! So what's the matter, Lisa? I can't do it. I don't wanna work with you. I cannot work with you. Never! Russia. Holy Russia... Hysteria, madness... I can, I can't. What are we gonna do, Sophia? Go on singing, of course. I'll replace her. But how are you gonna sing? It's a soprano and... now you're more of a- more of a mezzo. "He is the victim of circumstance," "and could never, never commit a crime!" "Could never commit a crime." "Oh, how weary I am!" "How tired!" "How worn out with suffering!" "Whether at night or in daytime," "I torture myself with thoughts" "only of him..." "Where are you, my former joys!" "Oh, how weary I am!" "How tired!" "Life promised me nothing but joy," "but a cloud came" "and brought the thunderstorm." "All that I loved in this world," "my happiness and my hopes" "have been broken!" "Oh, how weary I am! How tired!" "Whether at night or in daytime, I torture myself with thoughts..." "Where are you," "my former joy?" "But a cloud came and brought the thunderstorm." "My happiness and my hopes have been broken!" Wait, wait, wait. A young bastard steals money from an old mistress? Yeah. Disgusting. But I won't take money. I'll take this. Tell me, why did you want this? Huh? Do you remember when you bought this from me at the casino? Were you already in love with me by then? Huh? I want to know. Does it turn you on? Does it? It reminds you of me, doesn't it? Right? Right? I didn't sleep all night. I was thinking. - You don't know how to think. - Maybe that's true. Maybe so. But right now I need the money for a third stake. And you think I'll give it to you? - So, will you? - No, I won't. No. No. But to win a million, you need five hundred, you know that. Five hundred, I only have 180. Hermann never asked for money from anyone. I will get this money, and then you'll know what I'm really worth. Hello! Gagik, it's Andrei. Arrange a meeting for me with your uncle. I need that meeting real bad. - How much do you need? - 350,000, or 320. I want to bet 500,000, but I have 180. - Do you have an apartment? - Yes, but it isn't worth much. Besides, it'll take time to sell it, and I need the cash now. Looks bad. A cheap apartment, no car. What if you lose, what shall we do? I have my voice. It is my capital. You said yourself that talent is the most precious thing. I will work and pay off any debt. You will even make money on me. So I'm offering myself to you as a bond. If you want, we can even draw up a contract. No, not like that. Open! Come on. Do you want to stake yourself? Sure, you can stake your life, if you want. but then if you lose, you'll be my slave forever. If I say die, you'll die. And if I say work, you'll work your fucking butt off. - You'll obey me. - Uh-huh. I get it, I get it. You can still say no. - Yes, I agree. - "Hello." "Good day, is that David Georgiyevich?" "Hello, my name is Sophia Mayer." "I would like to see you." She cashed the cheque. From the bank, she went to the auto service on Berezhkovskaya. She had money in a packet. She stayed there for 40 minutes. What was she doing there? Then she came out of there without the money. I feel that Sophia got carried away. "The Queen of Spades staged by Sophia Mayer." "Hell, just once I wish to win!" - "Was Hermann there?" - "He was," "and, as usual, riveted to the gaming table" "from eight in the evening until eight the next morning." Stop! It's enough. "The day of the premiere came, and Gagik hadn't called me yet." "I didn't have the money." "I was desperate, because I had to play before the premiere." "The third game was my last test." "If I won, it would mean that I'd become Hermann," "that I was special, that I was the chosen one." - Yeah. - "We got what you need." Where are you? Here, count it. I trust you. I need to go. - When are you playing? - I'm playing right now. I'm already late. Where are we going? I appreciate it. But I'll go on my own. Stay here. One doesn't walk around town with so much money. We'll take you there. Let him go, please. You're driving him crazy. Do you want to go back to him after everything that happened? No. I want to save him. No one can be saved. Everyone has to save themselves. You whore! He will go with you. What are you afraid of? I'll win and give you back the money. Alright, go on. 500,000. Aren't you afraid to stake it all? Not really. I don't understand why you're doing this. The performance starts in three hours, and you just might become a star. You'll be famous all over the world. How about if we cancel? Let's get it over with quickly. Well. Quickly means quickly. Make your bet. I'll bet on the ace. What do they say in such cases? You card killed you. Wait! You're going to the theatre now, aren't you? Can you give me a lift? I need a ride. Hey! Come here! Come here! Come here. - Wait, wait, keep your hands off! - Everything's okay, guys, It's all right. It's all right. We're good. Andrei, hello. Let's go. Where have you been? We've been looking for you. Where's Sophia? I need Sophia. Are you crazy? You've got two minutes before you have to go on stage! "Stop this rubbish for it bores me!" "You make me mad!" "I am weary, tired out. I will not go to bed just yet." "Oh, with this world I am fed. Oh, what times!" "They don't know how to make merry." "What manners! What tone!" "Better not to see them..." "How to dance, or how to sing, they don't know!" - Andrei, we need to talk. - Not now, Lisa! - Listen, it's important. - I don't have time. Andrei, you've gone crazy. You've gone as crazy as Hermann. Put my coat in the dressing room. "I'm afraid to speak to him at night." "I listen to everything he says." "He tells me that he loves me," "and I feel, despite myself..." "I feel my heart beating, beating," "I don't know why." "Don't be afraid! For God's sake, don't be afraid!" "I'm not going to hurt you." "I've come to ask you for just one favor!" "You can make the happiness of my whole life!" "And it will not cost you anything!" "You know three cards." "For whom are you keeping your secret?" "If you ever knew the feeling of love," "If you remember the ardor and raptures of young blood," "If you smiled even once at a child's caress," "If a heart ever beat in your breast," "then I beseech you by the feelings of a wife, a lover, a mother..." "By everything in life you hold sacred," "Tell me! Oh, tell me. Reveal your secret to me." "What good is it to you? What good?" "You old witch!" "Then I'll force you to answer!" "Then I'll force you to answer!" "She is dead! It's happened! But I've never learned her secret!" It's important that we have a talk. "She is dead!" "I've never learned the secret!" "Dead!" "Help me! Save me." "Dead!" "Dead!" Help me. Please, save me. Get up, you're not on stage. What's going on? I've lost. Well, I tried to warn you. Hermann always loses on the third time. What's it got to do with Hermann? Don't you understand? I lost someone else's 300,000 dollars! They're not mine. You have to save me. Give me your money. - I don't have any money. - You're lying. I know you have it. No. Don't bother looking for it. Where's the cheque? Huh? Where is it? You're not listening to me. I don't have any money. I lost it at the casino. You're lying. I know you're loaded. I was rich, but not now. What have you done? Huh? They're going to kill me. Don't you understand? I am a goner. You wanted to be Hermann. You're him. Now go and sing. What did you just say? Just look at how desperate you are now. That's exactly what we need. Now go on stage and sing about it. Desperate? You want desperate? You want desperate? Here is it, prick! - You set me up, huh? - Yeah. You fucking set me up on purpose, right? Right? Idiot! - Idiot, you're late for your entrance. - I lost because of you. I lost because of you, you goddamned old witch! - Go on stage! Go on the stage. - I'll show you what despair is! - Bitch! Bitch! You old hag! - Go, sing! Yes, fucking bitch, you used me! You used me and you ruined me all for your miserable fucking opera! You will die! You will die! You played with my money. You liar! You lie! You're lying! You're lying! "Let's get to business, gentlemen. To the tables!" "More wine!" - Lisa, congratulations. - Andrei, we really need to talk. I just got done strangling your aunt. She's lying on the floor in the dressing room. "I bet on..." "Yes, ten." "My feelings will not deceive me." "I may be needing a second." "You will not refuse?" "Trust me!" "Hermann, my friend! Man!" "Why are you so late? Where have you been?" "Come and sit here. You bring me luck." "Where do you come from? Could it be hell?" Look, what a sight you are! Couldn't look more awful! "Are you ill?" "Why do you look so gloomy?" "Are you frightened? You frightened?" "Wine! More wine!" "Hermann, what's up with you?" "What is our life?" "A game! Good and evil are only dreams!" "Work and honor are old wives' tales." "Who's right and who's happy here, my friends?" "Today it's you, tomorrow I!" "So leave your struggles and seize upon a moment of luck!" "Let the loser weep and lament." "Let the loser curse his fate." "What's true? Only death!" "Like the shore of life's vain sea," "It's a refuge for all of us." "Which of us it favors more, my friends?" "Today it's you, tomorrow I!" "So leave your struggles! And seize upon a moment of luck!" "Let the loser weep and lament." "Let the loser curse his fate." "What's true? Only death!" - "No more play?" - "No. Take your winnings." "The devil himself seems to be on your side!" "If that's the case, what does it matter?" "Anyone will play? All this on a single card? Well?" "I'll take it on!" "I know what I'm doing!" - "Him and I have an account to settle!" - "You? You take me on?" "I do. Deal, Chekalinsky." - "My ace!" - "No!" "Your queen is beaten!" "What queen?" "The one you're holding. The queen of spades!" "Old witch! You!" "You're here! What are you laughing at?" "You drove me out of my mind." "May you be cursed!" "What? What do you want? A life? My life" "Take it, then! Take it!" Let's go. "O Lord, forgive him!" "And give rest to his rebellious, tortured soul." - This is our triumph! - It's you who killed him. Now you're a star. Here, I brought it. It's the start of your collection. In my opinion, it's beautifully done. Do you like it? Yes. "The Queen of Spades staged by Vsevolod Golovin." "I survived," "but I failed to bring anything to a successful conclusion," "even my suicide." "The icy water gave me my voice, and I lost it." "My vocal cords had been severed, and couldn't be sewn back together again." "But Sophia continued to sing to me," "just like she did in my childhood when I woke up in the hospital." "An opera was being broadcast on the radio," "and the first thing I heard was her voice." "You already know what happened next." "I tried to escape, but there was nowhere to run." Here, get dressed. Well, he's here. Get inside. "The rules of Russian Roulette are far easier than Faro." "There's only one bullet in the revolver." "You spin the cylinder and shoot." "Then you pass the gun to your opponent." "If both survive, you start again." "Only you, chance, and death; that's all." When I win, I'll go to the ocean. You can bet that I'll die young. "I wasn't even surprised when I saw her." "I could have guessed it." "In fact, since childhood," "I've always belonged to her, to Sophia Mayer." Subtitled by: Tarjama LTD Amman - Jordan
