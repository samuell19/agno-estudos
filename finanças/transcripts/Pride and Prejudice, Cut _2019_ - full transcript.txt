- You know, I used to think he was the worst man in the world, stubborn, arrogant, and the biggest snob I have ever met. Now, I don't know if I've met a better man save father of course. His stubbornness, arrogance, and snobbery just serve as an exterior to cover up a loyal, fastidious heart, which, once given to his family and close friends, I think, might be given forever. Jane, he's so kind, and so very funny when you get to meet him. And the things he's done for me I can't tell you. Jane, I think I'm in love with Mister Darcy. - Okay, great. - Thanks Kate, we'll be in touch with your agent. - Thank you. - I liked her. [bright instrumental music] - Hey lovely people, Kate here. Just got out of my audition, and I wanted to let you guys know as soon as possible how it went. I gave it my best. I was really nervous, and really worried about the British accent, but I think it went well, so we'll see how it turns out, I'll let you know when I find out, so wish me luck. [upbeat orchestral music] Hey lovely people, I have the most amazing news. My agent just called, and I got the part. I am gonna be playing Lizzy Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. I cannot believe, I am so happy right now. Thank you all for your support in watching this channel, as I become a professional actress.

Good morning. - Would either of you like to tell me why I wasn't made aware of your most recent casting decision? - I'm sorry, for which role? - You know very well which one. - The actress is very talented, Philippa, just magical on screen. She was on that Three Times a Charm show, which was a very popular US web series. - Web series. - Philippa, it's a little unusual for an investor to be involved in casting decisions, so I didn't think to consult you, and we have Sophie's expert eye here as a director. - I've already acquiesced to this decision to film in South Carolina, now you've hired an American Watch It star to play one of the most iconic characters in English Literature. I would expect the producer of this film to be more careful with the money I've invested. - I can assure you Philippa, I have nothing in mind other than your investment, and specifically the return on it. - How so? - Kate has a huge fan base from her web series, and her Watch It vlogging channel has over eight million subscribers. - What about her accent? - We're working with her on it. - This had better work. - Hey man, how's it going? - Fine, thank you. - Well I'm Brad, I'm a production assistant, so if you ever need anything just let me know. I'm here to help out with the production, and-- - I am aware of what a PA does. This isn't my first film. - Okay, cool. So, we'll just go ahead and head over to the hotel, and then you have a welcome party at the restaurant, the hotel restaurant tonight. - Yes, I have read the schedule. - So you're from England, huh? - What gave it away? - Right, the accent. You know, I'm actually an actor. I live in Atlanta, and started to take a few acting classes, and I decided to start working as a PA to get to know some of the directors, and get a foot in the door. How'd you get started? Okay then. [bright orchestral music] - Dear Kate, we are absolutely delighted to have you playing Lizzy Bennet in our adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. See you tonight at the welcome party. Sophie and Jackson. - Kate, this is Julia, she's gonna be playing your sister, Jane. - Hi, it's so nice to meet you. - You too. - I'll let you girls get to know each other. - It's very pretty here. - Yeah, this hotel is beautiful. So is this your first American film? - It's my first film. - Really, me too. - I feel so lucky to be doing something this amazing just out of school. - Yeah, I'm so excited to see what Sophie's gonna do with it, she's a genius. I'm sure before long we'll all feel like we're in regency-era Hertfordshire. - Look. - [Man] You must be two of the Bennet sisters. - Yes, hi, I'm Kate, I'm playing Lizzy, and this is Julia, she's playing Jane. - It's nice to meet you both. I'm Ben. - I know. - I'm sorry. Have we met before? - No, I saw you in Twelfth Night last year. - You did. My father did not think I was ready for Shakespeare on the West End. He's a bit headstrong. I'm afraid he might have been right. - No, no, you were wonderful. - Oh, well I'll be sure and tell him so. - Will you be playing Mister Bingley? - I am. - Can I assume that you're playing Darcy and Caroline? - That's correct. - I'm sorry, I didn't realize that our Lizzy was American. What are they doing about your accent? - Oh I've been doing a bunch of online tutorials for dialect training. - Sure the budget isn't big enough for an on set coach? - I suppose we are far from our sweeping English theatrical dramas where no expense would be spared, to insure accuracy and quality. But then what can you expect from a low-budget production? Jackson, I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be a part of this film. - Do you want to go get a drink? - Yes. - So it's sounds like we're gonna be spending a lot of time together the next couple of weeks. I heard you did a lot of theater in London? - Yeah, excuse me. - It's nice to meet you too. - Hello, I'm Sarah Edwards, I'm playing Missus Bennet. - Hi, I'm Kate Miller, I'm playing-- - I know who you are. It's such a pleasure to be working with you. My girls follow your channel religiously. You're quite the internet star. - Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be working with you, as well. [soft orchestral music] Hey, how'd you sleep? - Okay. It's a worry about the jet lag though. - Good morning. - Good morning ladies. Hope you slept well. - Hey Ben. - Julia, may I walk you to your seat? - Thank you. - I just figure that seeing as we're playing a couple on screen, might as well start behaving like one. - Good morning, Kate. - Hi, Sophie, thank you again for casting me, I'm so excited to play Lizzy. - Oh, I just loved you in Three Times a Charm, and when I saw your audition video, I couldn't say no. So, how's the accent going? - It's getting there. - Well why don't you see if one of your castmates will help you? We only have two weeks to rehearse, and our investor's very particular about authenticity. The accent will kind of have to be perfect by the time we start shooting. - I'll try my best. - I know you will. - Good morning. - Okay, let's settle in. - Good morning everyone. I'm Jackson, one of the producers of the film, and I'd like to welcome you all to our production of Jane Austen's beloved classic, Pride and Prejudice. We are pleased to have such a wonderful and talented cast, and of course such a talented director. I'll be popping in and out of rehearsals, but in the meantime, I'll leave you in Sophie's very capable hands. Good luck to you all, and thank you. - Okay, well I'm sure you've all met by now, so we're just gonna do a read-through from the top. So, Missus Bennet? - Mister Bennet, Netherfield has been let at last. - I never thought a passing could be this happy. - Whatever am I gonna do without you? You must promise to visit every week. - I will every day if I'm able. - No, we can't have you away from Mister Bingley so often. Cannot. Cannot. - You must come and stay with us at Netherfield. - So Mister Bingley has made up his mind to stay? - He says he will not dream of keeping me away from my family. Luckily, Caroline will be spending most of her time in town so, we'll be far away from his. - Jane, that is the first unkind thing I have ever heard you say. I've never been more proud of you in my life. - I am sorry he brought Mister Darcy with him. - I'm not, not. - Not. - I'm not. - Not bad. Let's slough through these last few pages, and then we can break for lunch. - Oh, do you know what, I'll be right back. I'm gonna use the restroom, don't let them start without me. - Okay. - [Liam] I understand you have your reasons. - [Jackson] So why are you questioning my decisions? - I'm not trying to disrespect you here, I just assumed you'd hire an English actress with proper training. - [Jackson] The accent will improve. - We're only rehearsing for two weeks. It's not enough time. - She's smart, she'll catch on. - I certainly hope so. I'll be a laughing stock back home, if I play opposite a Lizzy with an American accent. - She seemed to do well today when you helped her. - No, no count on me to walk her through every line, Sophie. I'm here to launch my American career, not coach your actress. - Look, we're going to ask everyone to pitch in to help her. It's not just gonna be your responsibility. - Well, where did she come from anyway? Why hasn't she been trained in accents? - She's had acting classes with some really good coaches. - I've never seen her in anything. What's her exact experience? - She has a very popular channel on Watch It dot com. - I'm sorry. - She has a very popular channel on Watch It dot com. - Are you kidding me? She's an internet star, that's it? - Yes, she was on a very successful web series, which she was excellent in. Now she has a channel primarily focused on vlogging, but she's a very committed actress. - Now I can't believe you would cast her. She has no idea what she's doing. - Okay, we have an out clause in her contract for performance. How about, if she doesn't get the accent by the time we start shooting, we'll recast her. - Oh so I'm supposed to waste my time and energy on an actress who isn't even going to end up playing the role? - She's going to get the accent, Liam. I have every confidence that she will. - Yeah well, I don't. [somber orchestral music] And I have come to the conclusion that I love you. - You love me? - Yes. No, sincerely. - Oh you sincerely love me, for how long? - What do you mean, for how long? - At what point did you first start developing affections for me? Was it say, your Aunt's dinner, or perhaps-- - Perhaps. - Perhaps Mister Bingley's ball. - I cannot say for certain, but I believe it began when we first met, at the Meryton assembly. - How odd. - Odd. - How odd. - In what way? - That you should develop affections for me the very night you refused to dance with me. - I told you, I have no talent for dancing, nor for making conversation with persons I've just met. I'm not like Mister Bingley. - Speaking of Mister Bingley, you claim to have affections for me, but I believe you're responsible for denying the future happiness of my most beloved sister. - I do not claim to have affection for you. I have stated that I love you. - Do you deny it? - Deny what? - Coming between two people who obviously care for each other. - I don't deny it. Mister Bingley's very effusive in his affections, and your sister-- - Is not, but that does not mean she feels any less. - Maybe not so hard on the O's Kate, but good effort. I think we can all definitely feel the vehemence from Lizzy. Let's take a 15 minute break, and then we can propel through the rest of the script, and call it a day. - You don't have to coach me if it's such an imposition. - Excuse me? - I'm sure you'd rather focus on your own acting. I can find someone else to help me with my dialect. - We've all been asked to help you out, and I'd rather you get the accent, than risk the quality of the film. - Don't bother. Hi lovely people. So as promised, here's an update of my first day as Lizzy Bennet. So I just got settled into my room, and I just finished my first day of prep for the film. We went through the script twice, I met quite a few of my costars. They're mostly polite, though I think the fact that I am American does concern them a little bit. Oh, the girl playing Jane is so nice. I think the two of us are gonna end up being friends. I mean I guess they do have a reason to be concerned. I'm struggling with the accent more than I thought I would. But, this has been a really long day, and I'm gonna run some lines, and get to bed. So, have a good night, sweet dreams, and remember to keep following yours. [sentimental orchestral music] Oh my gosh, I am so sorry. - Hey hey, it's totally fine. I'm a klutz with coffee too. That's why I always where black. See, you can't even see the stain. - Yeah, good looking ahead. - I'm Brad, I'm a PA. - Hi, I'm Kate, I'm playing Lizzy. - Awesome. Well, good luck with rehearsals, and my name's on the call sheet if you need anything. - Thanks. And I'm sorry, again. - My, he's a handsome one. - Brad? Yeah, I guess. - Well maybe not a good enough match for you, you are the star of the movie. - Match? - Oh, do you have a boyfriend already? - No, no and I'm not looking for one. - Well, there's not a lot of other options for you on this shoot. Ben seems quite taken with Julia already. There is Liam. Exactly, what about that actor that's playing Wickham? - Really Sarah, I don't want to be romantically involved with someone I work with. - Now how else are you going to get your picture in the tabloids? It's the quickest way to gain career traction. - You know what, I need to get ready for rehearsal. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Do you dance, Mister Darcy? - Not if I can help it, I have no talent for it, nor do I enjoy being forced to make conversations with persons I've just met. - What a shame, for I find it to be one of the true delights in life. - Your family seems to enjoy it. - If you're speaking of my sister Jane, yes I do believe she does. Doesn't she look marvelous dancing with your friend, Mister Bingley? - I think Lizzy would use that last line as a bit more of a taunt. - Doesn't she look marvelous, dancing with your friend Mister Bingley? - I was rather speaking of your mother, and your younger sisters, who are apparently out in society before the other are married. - Why should my younger sisters be prevented from enjoying society, just because the elder are not yet married? Not yet married? Not. - Okay, that's enough for now. Liam, do you mind helping Kate when she struggles with the accent? - It's my fault, just working on it. - Sorry, I'm just used to people who know how to speak properly. - [Sophie] Julia, Ben, let's do your scene. [quiet piano music] - And how are you feeling today, Miss Bennet? - A little better than yesterday. I feel like maybe I should go home tomorrow. - Mister Jones said you are not to leave us until you are fully better. I cannot imagine that will be tomorrow. - I do feel like I'm making myself such an imposition. - Not at all. I am sorry it is under such circumstances, but I could not be happier you are here. - These two are very natural together. It's almost like they're not acting. - Yeah, they're great. What? - She better not get any ideas. - Ideas? - About Ben. - What's the problem, does he have a girlfriend? - No. Ben is from a very prominent acting family. Many young actresses have gone after him, hoping to get a leg up in the industry. - Julia is so sweet, she wouldn't do that. - I wouldn't be so sure. - I feel sorry for you, if this is how you view people. - I guess you've never had the unfortunate experience of being taken advantage of by another person. - I have had the misfortune, but I choose not to let it affect my interactions with other people. - Fantastic. That's all for today, thanks. - Let us go then. - Great job today, guys. - Kate, can I talk to you for a second. - [Kate] Sure. - I'll see you tomorrow, Kate. - The accent. - I know, I'm trying. I think I was just a little bit nervous today. - Ask some of your castmates to help you. You have to get it before we start shooting otherwise-- - I know. I understand. [soft jazz music] - So, what do we have here? - Hi, I'm just working on my lines. - And the accent? - I'm struggling with it more than I expected. Actually, do you have a couple of minutes to help me work on it? - Of course. - Thanks. I really appreciate it. - Please, don't mention it. Do you want to start here? - Yes. Come Miss Lizzy, let us take a walk about the room. It is so refreshing, is it not, after sitting for so long? - It is a small sort of accomplishment I suppose. - Mister Darcy. - [Sophie] Hold on a moment, Miss Emilia. Let's run that line again if you don't mind, Kate. - What words did I say incorrectly? Small accomplishment? - It sounded perfectly fine to me. - From your line, Emilia. - It is so refreshing is it not, after sitting for so long? - It is a small sort of accomplishment, I suppose. - Sort. - It is a small sort of accomplishment, I suppose. - Mister Darcy, would you care to join us in a turn about the room? - I shall pass on your kind request, Caroline. - Too wrapped up in your work to enjoy a healthy jaunt? - Not at all. In fact there can only be two reasons for you and Miss Lizzy to be in your present occupation. Either you are in each other's confidence, and my presence would prevent your being able to confide your secrets, or you are aware that your figures are best observed from a distance, and if I walked right beside you, I could not admire them. - Mister Darcy, we are shocked are we not, Miss Elizabeth? - Absolutely. - I like this, we need to shift this over here. Others in-- - You guys wanted to talk? - Kate, come in. - I know what you're gonna say, I'm sorry, I don't know what to do. I even asked Emilia for help. - We have an idea. Why don't you take tomorrow off, and get some down time? - That might help. I am really tired and it's only been two days. - There we go. Do some more online dialect tutorials, and join us for rehearsals in the afternoon. - Thank you guys for understanding. I'll see you tomorrow afternoon. - Okay. - I don't like what we're doing here. - I don't like what we're doing, either. But what if she never gets the accent? We need another option for Lizzy. - I know, it's just so dishonest. - I'm actually more of a whiskey girl myself. - Really? They've got a lovely Scotch selection at the patio bar downstairs. Would you like to go? - Sure, when? - Are you busy now? - Hey guys, what's going on? - Well, were just thinking of going and grabbing a drink a the patio bar. - That sounds amazing, I could really use one of those right now, but you know, it's been a really long day. I think I'm just gonna go back to my room, and order some room service. - No, don't be silly, come on. Come with us. Liam? You'll come and have a drink with us, won't you? - Sure. - Great, look I'll text Emilia and we'll get the whole gang together. - You coming? - I guess so. - Great. - Do remember the night that actress playing Hermana forgot all her lines? - [Liam] Mmm yeah, I had to feed them to her under my breath all night. I was never so happy for a performance to end in my life. - It must be so frustrating having a costar you had to coach along. Luckily they fired her once they realized she wasn't a true professional. - She wasn't a very good actress though, it wasn't just not being able to memorize. - You know, you are an amazing Demetrius. I have to say it was my pleasure getting to play your Hannah. - Kate, have you done Shakespeare? - No I haven't, not since high school. - Not surprised. - I don't really like him, to be honest. - Isn't that sacrilegious for the British? - It's more like a son rebelling against his father. - I don't know, it looks like someone has some fans. - We're so sorry to disturb you, but would you mind taking a photo? - Of course. It's so refreshing meeting Americans who recognize British theater actors. - Oh, we meant Kate. Do you mind? - No, of course not. - Would you mind taking the photo? - Excuse me. I need to find the loo. - I can take your picture, here. - [Girl] Oh thank you. - One, two, three. [shutter clicking] - We just love you so much, you have no idea how much you've helped me. - Oh honey, come here. - Thank you for everything. - You're welcome. - So does that happen to you a lot? - Not all the time, just sometimes. - Kate's quite famous, she has a lot of subscribers. - [Ben] Really? How many? - I'm not sure. - Eight million. - How could you know that? - I'm one of them, I love your channel. And I watched Three Times a Charm religiously. - Kate, Emilia tells me she's been helping you with the accent? - Yeah, she was helping me last night. I thought I had it down but it didn't go so well today. - Maybe you shouldn't ask her for help anymore. - Well, I needed help and she offered. Excuse me, I'm gonna go back to my room. Have a good night, I'll see you guys tomorrow. - Okay, have a good night. - Yeah, goodnight. - You too. - Thank you for the stimulating conversation. Good morning, beautiful people. Just wanted to give you guys a quick update on how rehearsals are going. Things have been crazy. I have crammed so many lines in my brain, I don't even know how to form a sentence anymore. I knew this was gonna be hard but, I didn't expect to be so difficult to get the British accent. I don't know why, I mean I have watched tons of British films and TV shows, and I even downloaded a couple of online tutorials, but I only seem to get it right when this one actor corrects me, and it's just rude the way he goes about it. He's such a snob and he just thinks he's above everyone else. I understand that Lizzy Bennet needs a proper British accent but, this is my dream, and I'm gonna figure it out or I'm gonna get fired. I know it's not what you guys want to hear, but I promised I would be honest with you. Well, wish me well, and until next time, keep chasing your dreams. [soft orchestral music] - So what's the verdict? Anything look good? - Uh, the Eggs Benedict looks great. - You stole that from us, you know. - I'm pretty sure it's American. - Well, seeing how this country used to be English, I think we can safely claim the beloved breakfast dish. - I think it's actually more of a brunch dish, but I'm from LA, and we live for brunch. - LA? You're not in town for the film, are you? - I am, are you? I haven't seen you at rehearsal. - I wrapped on another film yesterday, and hopped straight on the plane. I don't think I've slept in 36 hours. - And you're playing? - Mister Wickham, at your service. I'm Will. - Kate. - You're playing Lizzy. - How did you know? Oh yeah, American. - Well, that settles it then. - Settles what? - I'm treating you to breakfast here, then accompanying you to rehearsals, so we can get to know each other. - Okay. [soft piano music] - Our waiter lost his mind, so I said, look, I'm sorry sir, it's just the name of the desert in England, I didn't mean to offend you. - I can't believe you said that. - Yeah, he kind of deserved it too. - Will? - Emilia, I wondered when it would be when I ran into you. - Yes, so lovely to see you too, darling. - Well now that you've arrived, it's gonna finally pick up around here. - Did anyone say rehearsal? I thought we all had the morning off. - Sophie just wanted me to work on some blocking. Yeah, you definitely weren't supposed to be here. Don't worry. - Oh Kate, Sophie's just finishing up a call, but we're almost ready to start. - All right. - All right well, I'd better pop up to my room and get some rest. Kate, lovely to meet you, and we'll try rehearsals. - Let me walk you to your room. [mumbling] - When did you meet Will? - We met this morning. - You two seem like old pals already, but I guess he has that affect on people. - You know him? - Yes. Look I, I realize you're a little naive but. - Okay guys. I'm sorry, I'm ready. - Be careful who you trust. - Why? - I'm trying to help you from making a fool of yourself. - And action. - And what about Mister Wickham? - Mister Wickham? - Yes, Mister Wickham. Can you explain why you went against your father's will and left poor Mister Wickham without a living? - Oh yes, poor Mister Wickham. A pretty face and sad story will always win a lady's sympathy. - I am not that kind of lady. - Pray, tell me, dear madam, what kind of lady are you? - Apparently the kind that is offered a declaration of love, while also enduring insults regarding one's family and choice of friends. - Am I to delight in the inferiority of your birth, the blatant crassness of your family, and your surprisingly gullible nature, which has led you to believe that Mister Wickham is the kind of person to call friend? - Mister Darcy, I feel compelled to inform you that from the very first moment of our acquaintance, your arrogance, conceit, and selfish disdain for the feelings of others, has led me to believe that you are the very last man on Earth I could be prevailed upon to marry. - You have said enough, Miss Lizzy. Thank you, for making your feelings known. I am sorry that my affection and offer of marriage have offended you so. I'll take care not to repeat them. - Cut. That was breathtaking. - The accent. - Barely noticeable. - No, I got so many words wrong. - We'll work on it. These performances were amazing. I really believe that you hated him. Liam, wasn't she fantastic? So, Spencer the costume designer is here. Let's get you over to wardrobe to try on what he has in mind for Lizzy. - Okay. - So, what do you think? - It's beautiful, I love it. - Well we're dressing Lizzy in all blues. The day dress will be more muted. - [Julia] Is it all right to come out now? - Yes girl, come out here and show us what you've got. - That is so pretty on you. - Now get up on the platform, and give it a twirl. - What color is the day dress? - Deep rose girl, deep rose. Jane is all about the pinks and roses. - It's a bit pink. Isn't it? - You look beautiful. And how are things with Ben? - I don't know, he hasn't texted me today. - That's strange. - I thought he liked me. Now I'm not quite sure. I suppose I said something wrong while we were out for drinks. - No, what could you have said? You were lovely. Maybe he's just memorizing lines or something. - Yeah, maybe. - And I'm sure he'll ask you out again, and hopefully this time you won't have any tag-alongs. - And how are things with Liam? - What do you mean? - With rehearsing the accent and him being a jerk to you? - It's okay, I just wish he wasn't the only one who could get me to say things correctly, which makes me dislike him even more. - You know the actor playing Wickham is supposed to arrive today. - Will, yes, I've met him. Super cute. [giggling] - You don't want to join your sisters picking hats and gloves for the ball? - I have no desire to spend money for those things, and you? I'm sure Lydia would welcome your opinion regarding her choice of finery. - I have no eye for such things. I was hoping to speak to you about the gentleman you just met. - Mister Darcy? - Yes, do you know him well? - We've met on a few occasions. Would you like me to introduce you? - No, we're already well-acquainted. You're surprised? - You said nothing to each other. - I'm afraid the way we last parted, forever destroyed our friendship. - I don't mean to pry. - Oh, I have no problem telling you this story, if you wish to hear it? - I do. - Hang on a second guys. - Shall we continue our stroll? - How do you know Liam? - He told you we knew each other? - Yes. - Did he say anything about me? - No, but it is weird that he didn't acknowledge you. - Well, I assume it's because he's turned biased towards somebody he stole a part from. - No, he didn't. I know he's a snob and everything, but that's terrible, what happened? - I'd hate to give you a bad opinion on the guy. - It's fine, I already have one. - In that case, we we're both up for the lead role on this amazing new production of Kafka's Metamorphosis. I nailed the audition. I knew the director wanted me for the bug character. - Gregor? - Yeah, that guy. But, Liam calls the director, and tells him a whole bunch of lies about me, how I'd like ditch rehearsal, or walk out on performances. He even said that I might leave the production altogether, if something better came along. - That's terrible. - I mean all completely untrue, of course. Thus, the director, so convinced by Liam's claims, that he fired me, hired him for the role. - I can't believe that. - You know what the worst part is? That play was a huge hit. It actually propelled him into stardom. And here he is now, booking all the lead roles, so I'm stuck playing supporting characters. - I'm so sorry, Will. I can't believe he did that to you. - Yeah, well, I guess I just have to get used to the fact that Liam's always gonna come out on top. Unlike him, I'm not gonna fight dirty. - No, Will, you are a super handsome guy, and you must be really talented if you originally had that role. You'll get a leading role, I'm sure of it. - You think I'm handsome? - Everyone, could I have your attention please? Thank you so much for a fantastic first week of rehearsals. Our wonderful investor, Philippa Jones, would like us all to join her for cocktails tonight at the penthouse at eight. I expect you all there on time, in cocktail attire please. And let's impress Philippa, and show her we are professionals, committed to this film, thanks. Will, can I see you for a moment please? - So this dinner tonight? - Yeah, it sounds fun. I can't wait to meet Philippa. - It needs to go really well. - I'm sure it will. - No Kate, really well. Philippa's been concerned from the beginning about us hiring an American, and you're still struggling with the accent. - I didn't realize she didn't want to cast me. - Kate, I really really believe in you, but we need to make Philippa believe in you, too. Okay, let's settle down everyone, and let's pick up from the next scene. Julia? And action. - I just cannot believe it. - It's what Mister Wickham said, word for word. - Maybe he's mistaken. After all, Mister Bingley trusts him. - He seemed very sure of it. - Something's not right here. We should reserve judgment until we have more information. - Jane, I do envy your ability to believe the best in people, even Mister Darcy. [soft piano music] - You better hurry up and get ready. You might not make it across town in time. - Across town? The party's in the penthouse. - Oh you didn't hear. Yes, no, they changed the location to Locomotive. Brad's actually driving me and a few others there, right now. - Can I get a ride with you? - Sorry, car's full. But you know I could send Brad back over to pick you up afterwards, it just might be too late. - No no, it's fine, I'll get ready quickly and grab a ride share. Thank you for telling me, I had no idea. - You're welcome. - I'm here, right on time, 7:59, I'm not late. - What's the name on the reservation? - It's not a reservation, it's a party for P and P Productions. - There's no party here, Miss. - Are you sure? It's the name of the a movie company. - There's no party. - But Emilia said. Emilia. Yeah. Thank you anyway. [soft piano music] - Brad, hey it's Kate. I have a huge favor to ask you. - Now, remember what I told you. - Yes Jackson, I know what we're doing, all right? - Good. - We are just so lucky to have you grace our little production with your presence. - Well, since your little production is being funded with my money, I thought I should come and supervise. - Philippa, I'd like to introduce you to Will. He's playing our rakish Mister Wickham. - I've heard so much about you, Philippa. I hope it's all true. - Wicked young man, you'd better believe it is. - Well, I'll leave you two to get to know each other. - So is it William, or Will? - It's whatever you want it to be. - These are delicious. - Didn't we just eat dinner? - I eat when I'm stressed, back off. - Any news on Kate? - No, not yet. - It's past eight. She was supposed to be here by now, to make a good im--, Ben. To make a good impression. She better be here soon. - I don't like what we're doing to her, Jackson. - We're not doing anything to her, Sophie. Our responsibility is for the best, and most successful film possible. And if she can't pull off the accent then, we'll just do the necessary. - Emilia is nowhere near the actress Kate is. - Emilia has the accent. I want those Watch It ticket sales, just as much as you do. - I think you want them more. [crowd chatting] - If Philippa's not happy, she pulls her funding, and then we have no film at all. - You are a lifesaver. There were no available ride shares. - I'm sure there's only a few in this town, and they're all probably busy because it's a Friday night. - Well I'm lucky you answered your phone. - So, what happened? Why are you all the way out here? - Someone told me the party was at that restaurant, which it clearly wasn't. - Sabotage? - Looks like it. - Was it that Liam guy? - No, but why would you say that? - I don't know, he's just kind of rude. - Not surprised. What did he do? - He just, he doesn't engage, you know. I mean, and I tried to tell him I was an actor. - And he didn't give you the time of day because you didn't go to some fancy school, and do a bunch of classical plays, right? - Pretty much. And what's with those headphones? - It's so weird, right? - Really weird. - I'm sorry he treated you like that. - It's okay. I'm gonna break through soon, anyway. I can feel it. - I believe it. It's gonna happen for you, Brad. - Thanks. - How far away from the hotel, are we? - Should be less than five minutes. - Great, I owe you one. - [Brad] Hey, don't sweat it. - So what would you say your career goal is, my dear? - Well, to be a leading man, for sure. - Well, you certainly have the looks. - And if I may be so modest, the talent. - Well, we all know that's not important. So what you need to do is to know how to play the game. You know there are many, many gorgeous young men out there, who want the lead roles in films. - I'm very aware, that everything has a price, and this case, I'm very willing to pay in. In fact, nothing would make me happier. - Philippa, so lovely to meet you at last. - You are? - Emilia. I play Caroline Bingley. - Oh yes. So sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier. I just figured you'd like to meet the lead actress first, but it looks like she's still not here. I guess she's as bad at showing up on time as she is at her English accent. - She's still struggling? - Oh dear. [soft piano music] - Thank you again. - You're late. - Emilia told me the location changed. - I don't care, just please, just be charming. Philippa, let me introduce you to Kate, the amazingly talented young lady playing Lizzy. - Hi Philippa, it's so lovely to finally meet you. Sophie and Jackson have told me so much about you. - I was just telling Philippa here, about your accent coaching, and how much in improvements you've made. - Let's hear it then. - I'm sorry, what? - Your accent, let's hear it. - I'm sure Philippa's just kidding. - I am not. I am investing my money in a production that has hired an American, untrained, internet star, to play one of English literature's most iconic women, and I have it on good authority that she is still struggling with the accent. So no, I'm not joking. I am telling you to show us your English accent. - I'm sorry, I don't appreciate your insults, and I'm not gonna perform on command. If you would like to hear my accent, you are more than welcome to come to one of our rehearsals. - You won't perform on command. Just what do you think an actress is? I'll tell you what, nothing more than a trained monkey. - Well thank you for your invitation, but you will have to excuse me. - I'll be right back. - My patience is wearing very thin. - Kate? Kate! What do you think you're playing at here. - Jackson, she's horrible. I'm not gonna stand there and be abused, I'm sorry. - She's investing in the film. Apparently you need a lesson on following the money. She can have whatever she wants. - Not my integrity. - If you leave now, you're seriously putting your job at risk. - Good night Jackson. - Lovely dinner. - Please talk some sense into her. - Kate? - Are you going to berate me, as well? - No. Not at all. I actually came to compliment you. - On what? - Standing up for yourself. That was quite impressive. I don't know that many people would have been so courageous with the person in control of their job. - Courageous, or just stupid? Well, thanks. - Would you like to have dinner with me, sometime? - Like a date? - Yeah. - You don't like me. - That's not true. - It is, you think I'm not talented because I didn't go to some fancy drama school, and I haven't been in a million famous plays. Oh, and I shouldn't be playing Lizzy Bennet, because I'm American. - Well yes, I do think that such a beloved English character should be played by an English woman with a natural accent. - And? - It's just easier sometimes to act with someone when they've had similar training. - So you don't want to be challenged by someone who has different experiences than you? Okay, got it. - But, I've become very impressed with you. You've worked hard. And I know the accent is still an issue but, I've never seen someone put so much effort into their character. I find it very admirable. - Did you say something to Ben about Julia? He seemed to like her before you got involved, and now he just ignores her. - I thought Julia may have thought she'd get ahead, by giving him attention. So yes, I said something to him about it. - Huh, and Will? - What about him? - Are you gonna admit you stole a part from him? - I've never stolen a part, I've earned them. - He said you spread rumors to the director of The Metamorphosis that he would miss rehearsals and he might leave the show without notice. - That's not what happened. No he got upset after he was cast, because he didn't realize beforehand that his pretty face would be covered up for most of the play in a bug suit. He quit on his own, Kate. - Okay, so you don't enjoy acting with me, because you think I don't know what I'm doing. You've been nothing but rude to me, and now you're taking me to dinner? - I'm sorry I asked, okay? So let's just carry on disliking each other for the next six weeks we have to work together. - That's exactly what I intend to do. - Have a wonderful night, Kate. [soft acoustic guitar] - [Liam] Kate, it's Liam. I'm sorry to call you so late. I don't know if you're not answering because you're made at me or if you're just asleep but, I feel like I have to defend myself regarding your accusations involving Will. I've known him for a long time. He's always used his looks to try to get ahead. He cares more about himself and his image than the character, the production, or the people involved. I understand why you'd be angry with me, and I promise to leave you alone but, please, for your sake, don't trust him. - Hi lovelies, I just wanted to give you guys a quick update after our first week of rehearsals. We've been working really hard, and actually last night we had a dinner with one of our investors. Turns out she's not thrilled that I'm playing the role of Lizzy. I guess that just means I have to really make sure my accent is perfect when she comes to rehearsals next week. But anyway, I'd better get to it so, all right my darlings remember to follow your dreams and make them a reality. Love you all. ♪ Say you don't know why ♪ Say you don't want to stay ♪ Don't know what it is ♪ But I got this feeling for you ♪ ♪ I won't turn away ♪ I won't let it go to waste ♪ Tell me what it is ♪ Because I've got this feeling for you ♪ ♪ I got this feeling for you ♪ I got this feeling for you ♪ And see pools breaking in two ♪ ♪ Singing your songs on the old tar roof ♪ ♪ There's no doubt from here on out ♪ ♪ I won't get along without you ♪ ♪ I won't turn away ♪ I won't let it go to waste ♪ Tell me what it is ♪ Because I've got this feeling for you. ♪ ♪ I've got this feeling for you ♪ ♪ I've got this feeling for you ♪ - Kate! - Oh Sarah, how are you? - I am doing very well. You know, for such a small town, they have a wonderful collection of shops. - That's great. - Now Kate, don't mean to butt in, but all work and no play makes for a boring girl. Now, I know you're under a lot of pressure, but I really think you should pull yourself together. - Well. - No excuses. - I know but I. - No excuses, you really need to try a bit harder. - Sarah, I am, I don't know why this is so difficult for me. - Well, okay, but perhaps you'd like a little help from me. - Oh, that would be wonderful, do you mind? - No, of course not. What woman doesn't need a bit of help, now and again? - Oh, thank you so much. I could use all the help I could get. - Oh darling girl, you're so lovely. Any man would be happy to have you. - Thank you, that's very sweet of you to say, but about your help, do you mind? Do you have time now? - Oh good, you need to come with me. - Can we work on it here? - Well if you want me to find you a man, we shouldn't be here. I mean, we need to go mingle. - Oh, wait a minute, I thought you were talking about helping me with my accent. - Oh no Kate, I'm talking about finding you a man. You're getting older dear, and you're still single. - Sarah I-- - Oh, I know, I know, you're here to act not date, but you could miss out on the right opportunity to meet the right guy. - Sarah, I appreciate that you care, but I really need to focus on getting this accent down. - Oh. - But, I promise to keep an eye out for Mister Right if he shows up. - Oh good, I'm so glad we had this little chat. Anyway, I'd better run. I will see you bright and early in the morning. - Bye. - Toodles. - Marriage, Lizzy are you quite serious? - I would not joke about such a thing. - Whatever did you say? - Jane, he's the most deplorable man I've ever met in my life. What else could I say but no? - How did he take the rejection? - His pride was hurt, I'm sure, knowing his arrogance but, more than that, I cannot say. - What did you give as your reasons? - His distaste for my station, his dislike of our family, his ill-treatment of Wickham. - What did he say of Wickham? Did he deny the allegations? - He did. He claims that Wickham seduced his younger sister, and planned to elope with her. Darcy found out and put a stop to it by cutting him off entirely. - Lizzy, do you really think that's the truth of it? - I'm not sure. And now that I've heard both sides of it, I don't know who to believe. - Should we tell father? I can't imagine he would allow us to walk into town with Wickham, if he knew the allegations, especially our little sisters. - No, we do not yet know the truth. - Cut. - Take a look at this. - I'm doing terrible. - No no, you're just a little rusty from your day off. - I've been working on it. - This is unacceptable Sophie. She can't go around talking on her channel about the production, and the person investing in it. - Have you thought of asking Liam for help? - What, why? - It's unacceptable. - You need to calm down, it's not that much-- - I am calm. This is me, calm. Do not tell me to calm down. - You just seem to do really well when he coaches you. - I don't know if that's such a good idea, it might be kind of awkward. - Look, I know he's said some things that were quite mean but. - No no, it's not that it's, he asked me to dinner and I said no. - When? - Um, after the cocktail party with Philippa. - Well things are starting to make sense now. - Like what? - I just noticed he's been watching you quite a lot recently. - Probably critiquing my acting. - No, not that. - That's the end of it. Kate, can we see you in the office please? - Okay. - Awkward or not, it might be your only option. - Take a seat, Kate. Philippa has some business that is taking her to New York for the week, but she'll be back on Friday to come to rehearsals. - I'll be ready, I promise. - Kate, I'm more concerned about this at the moment. - Really hard, and actually last night we had a dinner with one of our investors. Turns out she's not thrilled that I'm playing the role of Lizzy. I guess that just means I have to make sure my accent is perfect. - I don't understand why you'd post a video disparaging the production, and the person investing in it. - I didn't mean to. I just posted a video about what I was doing with my life, that's what I do. - You're lucky Philippa hasn't seen this. You need to take it down. And from now on if you post anything about the production, or anybody involved in it, it must be done so in a positive light. - So you want me to lie? - No, we don't want you to lie. - Kate look, you have to understand. Your channel is a marketing tool for this film, and by speaking ill of it, you put its success in jeopardy. - Spencer needs to see you for a fitting before this afternoon's rehearsal. - Okay. - It's a very nice color on you, don't you think? - Yes, you've done quite the job. - Oh Kate, honey, your dress is in the back of the screen. Go in and change so I can check the fit. - [Kate] Sure. - Stop fidgeting. Why do you seem so anxious? I am not gonna stick you with pins. - Sorry. - Oh Kate. Not to compliment my own work, but you look beautiful. Come over here in the mirror. Almost a perfect fit on the bodice, just a few more places to be adjusted, but you look absolutely gorgeous. Liam, doesn't she look gorgeous? - Yep. - Well then, tell her that, silly man. - You look beautiful. - Thanks. - My goodness Liam, I hope you'll be more convincing on screen. - Can I get out of this, now, please? - No, just wait right where you are, let go get my phone and take a picture for Sophie. - You do look very pretty. - Thank you. You look really nice, as well. - Really? - I may need to ask you a favor. But feel free to say no. Mister Collins, will you please pass me the water? - [Liam] Water. - Water. - Water. - Water. - No, softer, make a www sound with your lips. No, I think you just need to relax a little. - I know what will help with that, and it's not water. - Water. You bought this used, I assume? Looks like it's been read about 100 times. - [Kate] Probably mostly by me. I got it for my 13th birthday. - Wow. You're quite the Austenite. - Of course. Aren't you? - No. - Are you serious? You're playing Mister Darcy, and you don't love Jane Austen? - Well, I don't love her, she's fine, it's just, romance stories for women. - It's not just romance stories. She understood human nature and relationships better than anyone else I've ever read. - Well that is quite the endorsement. I guess I'll have to give her a try some day. - You've never even read her? Oh, now I need this more than anything. - I just never got around to it, I guess. To Miss Austen. - Thank you for doing this. You really didn't have to. - My pleasure. - If I don't get this right, I think they're gonna fire me. - I don't think so. The accent may be a struggle but, your acting's really good. - Really? - Really. - Well, you've just seen me in rehearsal, we'll see how it ends up on screen. - Well if your Watch It videos are anything to go by, you'll probably be pretty great. Yep. Okay I've watched your channel. I was very dismissive about it in the beginning but, I was wrong. - Wow. Thank you. - You know their not actually going to fire you. They need you. I don't want to hurt your feelings but, they are counting on your subscribers for the box office. - I know. It's the main reason they hired me. - You knew? - Of course, but, I really appreciate you telling me. - I didn't want you to worry about it. But, we should get back to it. - Water. - That said, let's try something easier, like wine. - Wine. - Perfect. - See, that sounds the same in both accents. - See, easier. - Hi lovelies, I know it's a little late, but I wanted to give you a quick update. Everything is going great. Everything has really turned around this week. The cast is friendlier, my accent is improving, and I really feel like it's all gonna work out. Yeah, I can't do this. I can't lie. When I made this channel, I promised to be authentic, and not sugarcoat how hard this was gonna be, and to be honest everything is really a mess right now. I made the producer angry by posting my videos. That investor is not happy with me. The girl who plays Caroline hates me, and I'm still working on my accent. But the one good thing is my accent is actually improving. The guy playing Darcy, Liam, he's helping me. I'm probably gonna get in trouble for posting this video but I have to be truthful. Please remember to follow your dreams, and always be true to yourself. And I'll try to remember that, too. I've never been happier than at this moment, my darling husband. - I'm very pleased to hear so. A lovely wife. - And tell me, are you happy? - Let's see, I married a woman whose beauty is matched by a lively mind, and a courageous spirit. No man has ever been happier. - Well, I've seen enough for today. - Let's go to the office Philippa, I'll make you a cup of tea. - I guess we're done for the day. Go have an early night. - You did an amazing job, today. - Really? The accent was okay? - Oh, it was perfect actually. You were perfect. - I really appreciate you spending all your free time with me this week. I wanted to make you feel like it was worth it. - I've never seen someone work harder to achieve something. I'm very impressed. - Thank you, that means a lot. - Also I, I wanted to say that, I'm really sorry about what I said that night. I mean I shouldn't have-- - It's okay. We'll pretend it didn't happen. Friends? - Friends. Would you like to grab something to eat? As friends? - Thanks, but I was actually gonna run by wardrobe and see how my dress is coming along, now that, I'm convinced I'll actually get a chance to wear it. - Next time then. I'll see you at rehearsal. - Yeah, I'll see you then. - I'm gonna have to start all over, you have very different proportions than Kate. - What is going on? - Kate, honey, I'm so sorry. They just told me today I had to fit Emilia for your costume. - I can't believe this. - There's more to acting than just fixing your accent. Looks like Philippa finally realized you just lack the talent. - Sweetheart it's okay, you'll get another role. - Yes, maybe they'll recast you. Although considering the accent problem, it'll probably have to be a background role. - Excuse me. - So how about some numbers, Jackson? - We're looking at another 20 thousand for the other location, plus we have to get local hire extras. Kate? - Why are you recasting me, I got the accent. - Jackson, take care of this. - I warned you about the videos, Kate. - But you said if I performed to your standards, I wouldn't get fired. - Yes, but we would if you jeopardized the production's reputation. - And those videos of yours most certainly do. - I was just being honest. - And it's going to cost you. - I'm very sorry, Kate. [Kate sobbing] - Oh Kate, what's wrong? - They're gonna recast me with Emilia. - But you got the accent. - I know, that's what I said, but Philippa doesn't like my Watch It videos, because I won't lie. - I'm so sorry. I wish there was something I could do. - It's okay. I know we didn't get off on the right foot, but I'm glad I got to know you, and thank you for all your help. - That was my fault. The bad start. - You made up for it. - Jackson? Sophie? Philippa, I need to talk, oh. Excuse me, I should have knocked. - It's fine, I was just on my way out actually. - See you tonight for a drink? - I wish I could but I have lines to learn. Maybe tomorrow. - You should thank your lawyer for negotiating such an ironclad contract. Lizzy wasn't the only role I wanted to recast. - I have a proposition for you. - Hi loves, well I got the accent, and I'm so proud of myself. But the investor got upset with some of the videos I've posted, and it looks like I'm gonna be replaced as Lizzy Bennet. It was fun while it lasted. Even though it was hard, it's the most fun I've ever had. I'm not giving up. I'll get another role. Hi, Sophie? I don't understand. - Congratulations everyone. We've made it to the last day of rehearsals. Give yourselves a big round of applause. Just one small change to the cast before we start shooting next week. Mister Darcy will now be played by Will, and Liam will now be taking over the role of Wickham. Let's take five, and we'll begin today's rehearsals. - Can you believe it, we're completely shocked. - I don't know what's happening, I thought they were gonna replace me with Emilia. - Looks like she thought so, too. - And you want her with her fake British accent, to be bringing us and our entire lives down. - Right, yes, coffee, cream, no sugar, and three biscuits. Sorry Kate, cookies. - When did this happen? - He texted me a couple of days ago. I didn't want to say anything, because I was worried he would lose interest, again. - Did he explain why he ignored you? - He apologized. He said he wasn't sure I liked him. But apparently Liam talked to him. He said it was probably because I'm shy, and he should try again. - Really? Liam? - Liam. - Okay guys, and action. - Once again. Darcy. - Mister Bingley's proposal to Jane. May I assume you are responsible? - That was all for you. My feelings for you have remained unchanged. One word from you and they shall be silenced for good. - Your Aunt? - She was here. - She asked me to promise never to enter an engagement with you. - Yes, I know, and your refusal to do so has given me hope. Yeah, I hope. - Mister Darcy I am now and fairly yours. - And cut. It's getting late guys, I'm sorry to do this but, if we're gonna be ready by Monday, we're gonna have to work through the weekend. - Do you like it? - The accent sounded good. - Really? I am hoping Liam will still help me even though-- - He probably will. He really respects your work ethic. - I'll ask him. - And Kate, I'm sorry. I didn't want to recast you and, I'm really happy you're still our Lizzy. - It's okay, I understand. I know you were in a tough spot with Philippa and Jackson. - That's very generous of you, but I should have been more honest. - I appreciate that. And I'm looking forward to starting filming. - Everything okay? - Fine. He says he's tired after a long day of rehearsals. I'll check on him in a bit. - I hope you thanked Liam properly, for what he did for you. - What did he do? - Are you stupid? He's the one that made the deal with Philippa. He gave up his role to Will, if she let you keep your role as Lizzy. - I had no idea. - You've got him wrapped around your little finger don't you? - It's not like that. - Well, don't get used to it. I will be Lizzy. [knocking on door] - Hi. - Hi. Can I come in? I'm sorry about what happened. - Hmm, that's just business for you. You never know what's going on behind the scenes. I just feel bad for you. - Why? - You get to play opposite Will. - Liam, I know you sacrificed your role so I could play Lizzy. - Who told you? Emilia? - How'd she find out? - She's been cozying up to Will lately, and I guess he told her, and then she confronted me about it after the announcement. - I can't believe you would do that for me. But I'm sorry I can't accept it. I'm gonna step down as Lizzy. - No, Kate this is your chance, to become a professional, with the role of your dreams. And you worked so hard, please. Let me do this for you. - It's too generous. No, this is your chance to make your big break in American films. I can't let you do that for me. [screaming] What was that? - William you-- [confused yelling] - We were just rehearsing. - And what scene do Caroline and Darcy share in their pajamas? - Please, I am so sorry. I promise, Will told me that you two-- - What sort of idiot do you take me for, you silly little girl? - You're both fired. - Oh Philippa, come on, it was just a mistake. - Jackson get the production assistant fitted for Wickham's uniform. And find me an actor who can pull off an accent to play Caroline. [Emilia whimpering] - You, you're back on as Darcy. - Only if Kate still plays Lizzy. - Fine. - Really, even though I posted those videos? - Well your champion here convinced me that a little bit of controversy would be good for ticket sales. Jackson. - Hi loves, well it's the last day of filming Pride and Prejudice. In a few minutes, we're actually gonna shoot our last scene for the day. I can't believe we made it. - [Brad] Kate, Kate. - Hey Brad, yeah get in here, come here. You guys remember Brad, our Mister Wickham. - I hope all of you lovely ladies will go to the cinema to see this film. - And here is Ben and Julia. Still together, how long has it been? - About six weeks. - Two months for me. I fell for her, the moment I saw her. - And they are as disgustingly cute in real life, as their onscreen counterparts. Here's Liam, still wearing his headphones. He finally told me why he wears them. It helps him block everything out and focus on his character. Oh, yeah of course. - Hi subscribers, I hope you remember seeing me. I play Missus Bennet. - Oh I'm sure they remember you. - You know, I've been thinking Kate, now that Brad is a real actor, perhaps you should make a play for him. - And on that note, we're gonna end the episode, yeah. - Kate, Liam, over here. - Okay, now I really do need to go. I am so sad this is coming to an end, but I'm so excited to see how it's all gonna turn out. Well, wish me luck, and remember, keep following your dreams. Let me thank you, in the name of all my family, for the generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications for the sake of finding them. - If you will thank me, let it be for yourself alone. the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements that led me on, that I shall not attempt to deny. Your family owes me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you. You're too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged but, one word from you will silence me on this subject forever. - My feelings have changed. - No, I must confess that I admire and love you most ardently. - Cut. [upbeat orchestral music] Keep rolling.
