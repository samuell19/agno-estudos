[ Paper Rustling ] [ Breathes Deeply ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ In Hebrew ] Give me your gun. [ Clicks ] [ In Hebrew ] Your clip. [ In Hebrew ] Tell the guy to come already, so we can get this over with. What do you need him for? He's the investigator, isn't he? Do I look like his secretary? Something like that. This is my investigation. Last time I'm asking for the clip. Okay, let's cut to the chase. We have much more important work to do.What work? Stealing cars contrary to orders? Is it better to just sit around and jerk off like you guys? Watch you mouth. Sergeant Nimrod. I've had it. You don't move until I say so. Is that clear?Oh yeah? Oh yeah. If you go on like this, you won't get far. Are you threatening me?Yes. What do you want to know about Confino? Put down your gun and sit. "Please." Let me remind you that you're being questioned. I was at home that Saturday! Why did you bring me here? You don't decide why we brought you here. Sit, I said! Scary... Did you do something wrong? Who says I'm afraid?Do I scare you? You wish. [ Cell Phone Rings ] Mom, I told you not to call me when I'm here! Mom, I can't deal with your stuff while I'm here! Okay. Call the gas company and ask how much for a cylinder. I can't. I'm in the middle of an interrogation! Bye.[ Beeps ] Confino took the HQ's Toyota, which was on call, and drove it to see his girlfriend in Jerusalem, like it was his car. And I think we finally found the person who knows what went on. Who?You. Me?Yes, you. How did you get to me?You were the last one to drive with him. No, that was Friday morning. We drove to the brigade and back. I headed home at 2:00 a.m. and came back on Sunday. But he told you what he had planned, right? No. Why don't I believe you? You're wasting your time. I don't know anything. I wasn't even at the battalion that Saturday. I'd gone home. Playing the tough guy, huh? Let's get this straight. Are you accusing me of something? You need to tell the truth. If not, it's an offense!I'm telling you the truth. This Conformi guy is going to jail!His name's Confino. You're all like that, aren't you? Doing what you like and hoping no one will notice. No. So why didn't you do anything?Here we go again. You knew he was going to steal the car! You think I knew anything?What did you know? Did you hear me say I knew anything?I can see it in your eyes. Are you trying to make me crazy? What? Why'd you jump up? Sit down. Of course you didn't know anything. You're a good boy, Nimrod. That Saturday you went home. I get it. But you were there on Passover night, right? What did you do on Passover night? What happened on Passover night? We're in the middle of final training, I have to get back. "What is done at night is revealed in daylight." What? Nothing. A line from a movie I saw last night. Do you like old movies, Nimrod? Very much.Yes? Really?Yes. You're the first to tell me that since I was ten years old. Interesting. What I like about old movies is that back then, things were clear-cut. There were good guys and bad guys. It was black or white. Now it's different, isn't it? Now everything's much more blurred. Talk to me, bro! About what? About what's been bothering you since Passover night. Nothing's bothering me. You're a lone wolf, aren't you? What? Within your pack, the "Samaria Wolves." I think I'm on the tracks of a lone wolf. Why do you think that? Dunno. Sense of smell. You like old movies, black and white. Good and bad guys.How much more time must I waste here? You'll leave when I say so.I'm needed at the battalion! Are you sweating, or is it my imagination? It's your imagination.[ Cell Phone Rings ] Mom, I asked you not to shout. Of course it'll cost 70 shekels. Special delivery. Mom, I can't talk to you now. Please, I'll call you back. Sorry I'm yelling, but I'm in the middle here. I'll get home and deal with everything. [ Beeps Off ] Okay, go. I'll get to you. Go. What do you want? Nothing happened on Passover night. No? It interests me because there're rumors. Rumors? That you did things, and I think you... I didn't do anything! Maybe you didn't, but others do. Maybe. What things didn't you do, Nimrod? A true fighter doesn't snitch. A true fighter knows the difference between black and white. If you know something, you must report it. Give me a thread, that's all. [ Pen Clicks ] [ Writing ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] Took a while, eh? I'm onto something.Yeah, I noticed. "Company Commander Davidi. Arrest. Passover night." So? So what? It's connected to the complaint against them on Passover night. We can't get into their fucked-up world. Who says it's fucked-up? "Samaria Wolves?" Their lives are fucked-up! He wrote it here, clearly! What did he write? "Passover night?" He wrote down the name of the company commander. So he wrote it. So what? He seems like someone who takes responsibility for what he does. Now you're a psychologist? I'm late for the conference. Close the case. Yes "sir!" Those Samaria Wolves are bastards. I hate them too, but they're doing their job. We have to do ours. I have a splitting headache. Drink less at night, maybe that'll help. Sipping tea in front of the TV like you and Michali, the "Bourgeoisie"? - I need coffee. - Not now, Anna. I'll bring you coffee. You close the case. [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Slurping ] [ Anna's Voice ] Then I run after him... But I can't catch up with him. And then he turns around... and it's you. [ Male Officer ] Me? [ Anna ] Yes. Forget it, it's just a dream. Yeah. When did you last see him? My Dad? Four years ago. Did you go to Russia? No, he came here to visit me. Once. I haven't seen him since. I wonder what this dream means. It's part of the mess in your head before you leave the army. [ Scoffs ] Mess? My mess is just beginning. Yesterday the landlord told my mother he was raising the rent. Why?Why? Because of people like Michali's father, that's why. [ Chuckles ] Here's a great joke I heard from a big shot lawyer in his firm. Well?What's this? What's this? A dead Jew. Why?Why? Because if he were alive, he'd be doing this. [ Laughing ] What a jerk! [ Both Chuckling ] Brilliant!Tell me, what happened at the senior investigators' meeting? Nothing special. Ben Zion starred?Went on and on, as usual. [ Laughing ] Never shuts up! Did he have "New Strategies"?Yep. What do you care? You're leaving in three weeks. Right. I don't have much time. Do your time and end your army duty problem free. Let's summon this company commander and crack him. Who? This Davidi, the CO from the Samaria Wolves. Didn't you close that case? No. Close it, Anna. There's nothing there, I'm telling you. You watch too many movies. Am I the only one here who cares? Just so I know, are you trying to prove something? I wonder why you feel threatened. Get off it. I don't feel threatened. It's just one of your obsessions. You're a coward, Erez! That's what you are. Just a coward. All because of that sergeant? No, it's my job and I'm doing it. I just want to protect you, Anna. Do you know who they are, these Samaria Wolves? We're not in their league. Know who their brigade commander is?I've heard about him. And you want to mess with him? Why, aren't they humans? This is bigger than drugs, than bribes, even bigger than arms. It's political, Anna.Don't you trust me? That's not the point!So what is? Politics are dangerous. It could backfire, hurt your future. You understand? It could hurt your future. I look out for you. You're important to me. You look out for your own ass! You like it too, don't you? [ Writing ] [ Anna ] I know exactly what you did in K'far Karum. Where? You're suspected of inflicting grievous bodily harm, of abusing a helpless person,Mm-hmm. and of behavior unbecoming an officer. K'far Karum, on Passover night. Want to tell me something about that? You don't have to if you don't want to. But anything you say... So now you're playing at cops and robbers! I see. I'm not playing with you, Davidi. I told you what you're suspected of doing and I cautioned you. So maybe I need a lawyer for all this. Why? Did you do something wrong? Are you telling me someone filed a complaint against me? Hmm? Look, we can do this the easy way, which they'll take into consideration. Or you can choose the hard way. The hard way, of course. That's what I like. Five years in the Occupied Territories taught me there's no other way. For your information, I have all the time in the world. [ Chuckles ] Can your commander come in for a minute? Why?None of your business. Hmm. You can't handle a woman questioning you? No, I don't like someone of your rank questioning me. Who would you prefer? The Chief of Staff? Possibly.Yeah? So rest assured. I'm allowed to question officers of your rank. There are things you'll never understand. What things? How to abuse Arabs for no reason? Oh! That's why you brought me here! I see. So relax, right now! Never once during my service was a complaint filed against me. I wonder why!What do you want? What's your problem? I'm sorry. Sorry, I forgot how important your work is out there. Are you making fun of me?No, not at all. Because you sound like--Like what? Never mind. Does it make you nervous? Nervous? Listen. Had you gone through what I've experienced there, I don't think anything would make you nervous.Hmm. They did say you were a distinguished officer. I asked about you, they said you were the most conscientious officer in the battalion, insanely motivated. Yes, I know. I try. So how come a star like you finds himself here? I don't know and I have no trouble with that. But I do, because on Passover night in K'far Karum-- On Passover night I was protecting you, sweetheart. So something did happen there! I'm such an idiot! You're right. I remember now. I remember my whole family waited for me at home, but I was busy defending the country and babes like you, so that you could spend the holiday with your families! I'm such an idiot!So you can do what you like? I didn't do anything wrong. I don't know what you want with all your bullshit, and I want my battalion commander here, now! What's up, Davidi? Got scared?No way. I'm just tired of all the lies you're pushing on me! Okay, can we move on? People are waiting for me. Who? The Palestinians in K'far Karum? I'll bet they miss you. You're really funny, you know that? We're not done. We'll stay here till morning, if needed! You're delusional. You're just military police. Yeah, even you need to be watched over.You, watching over me? You're watching over me? You're living in a dream! There's a complaint. A Palestinian family driving their car. Our force stopped it and an officer of ours abused them for no reason on Passover night!And you believe fucking Arabs. So you did it!I was just saying. Theoretically. You'd have blamed someone else otherwise! "Some family complained." Good for them! And instead of doing my job, I have to listen to this bullshit you're feeding me. Are you going to investigate anyone who squeals now? That's what bothers you? That someone squealed? So tell me who it was, and I'll solve the whole problem. Don't take me for an idiot! I can see this thing is getting to you. It's okay. Know what? Get out of here. Can I have my clip back? Thanks. [ Gun Clatters ] [ Door Closes ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Door Closes, Locks ] [ Moaning ] [ Kisses ] [ Breathing Heavily ] Why do you look worried?Huh? Did anything happen?No, nothing. Don't you worry. We'll get those Wolves, trust me. [ Chuckles ]Let them stew for a while. That's what's on your mind now? What then? Michali? We're getting married in two months. Mazel tov. Thanks. What? I'm not sure it's the right thing. Well, that's normal. What's normal? To have these thoughts. Getting married means closing the shop for life. [ Chuckles ] Don't exaggerate.I trust you. Yeah, it'll be okay. Do you talk about it? What, are you kidding me? If I tell her now that I'm not sure, it'll kill her. And if you don't tell her, it won't? You think? Is she pregnant or something?No. Pregnant? So what's bothering you? Marriage is heavy stuff. Okay, so get married. Worst case, you change. "It's a free country, baby!" Which movie is that from? Metzitzim.Haven't you seen it?No. There's a great scene with Arik Einstein. He comes to her like this, "You don't want to? Fine. It's a free country, baby!" I'm nuts about that head of yours.And I'm nuts about your ass. So why risk it with 433? No, it's not me. It's "Core values: Human dignity, integrity, determination."Right. So? The means justify the end? Trust me, there's something there bigger than you think. I'll prove it to you. We'll see. What's that? Are you with me, or am I alone in this?I'm with you. Are you with me like you're with Michali? That was below the belt! Sorry. I'm sorry. I need to know who's going into battle with me. I'd never leave you alone.Yeah? "Till death do us part?" [ Chuckles ][ Chuckles ] So shall we get married?Yeah, have a catholic wedding! [ Laughs ] You're the only one who makes me laugh, you know? What will you do without me? Did you ever seriously think about us? [ Chattering ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] Yes, Mom. Yes, I'm on my way home. I don't know, when the bus gets there. Yes, I'm on the bus. No, we don't need anything. I'll be there soon. Bye. [ Beeps Off ] [ Anna ] It's very difficult for me. Either you fill me in, or...[ Nimrod ] Or what? Or we let it go. Can you let it go now?Easily. I don't think so. Man, I'm getting out in three weeks. [ Chuckles ] What's so funny? The way you say "man." It's funny. Yeah, this way of talking is stupid. I hate it. No one can control it. Control what? Do you really think we can control anything in this life? Of course.Really? I'm sure of it. I realized long ago that we have no control over our lives. Things happen. Always happened, always will. What things are you talking about? I think there's no way back for me. Why, did someone talk to you? Davidi called me in for a talk.What did he say? That he knows I reported him. How does he know? Within the team it could only be me. Okay, but that doesn't give us anything. It's not enough. He already took me off interrogations. So?So, what? What don't you get? They won't let me go out on raids or operations, not even for regular patrols. I want to close everything. What?Nothing. I just wrote a few words. I didn't do anything. Want to go back there? Keep on doing what you do there? You enjoy it? Got a better idea?Yes! To see it to the end! [ Sighs ] A trial? If need be, yes. And I'd have to testify against him? Others will testify too. No way. The people there see things, then keep quiet for years. Do you have anything personal against Davidi? Did he disrespect you? Sleep with your girlfriend? No, I don't have a girlfriend. Did he hinder a promotion? Humiliate you? Not at all. I even appreciate him very much, professionally. Professionally? Disregarding orders is professional? An officer oversteps his authority, threatens, hides evidence. That's professional?I meant, as a soldier. Soldier, my ass! First of all, be a role model! That's basic stuff! Not to mention be a human being. He's good at certain things. You're using me! I'm such a jerk!Using you? I don't know what exactly happened there. I have nothing! Just a complaint from a Palestinian family. No record, nothing from a hospital, and I have no idea what your part is in all this. I... I swear, I--Want me to believe you? Testify against him. [ Door Opens ] Sit down. [ Door Closes ] Did you unload your gun? Yes. [ Chuckles ] [ Clicking ] You're accused of disrupting a wedding. I plead not guilty. I want a lawyer. Where did you spend the night?At home. [ Chuckling ] Where did you sleep? At home, I swear. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. The hard way sounds excellent. Okay. Even super excellent. [ Both Chuckle ] [ Laughing ] This belt of yours. Okay, forget the belt. [ Groans ] Everyone's saying you didn't sleep at home. Everyone! [ Chuckling ] Okay, enough. I'll tell you.Yeah? I slept at Doron's. Doron?Yes. Or did you fuck someone else? [ Chuckling ] I didn't fuck anyone, I swear. You fucked someone, admit it.I didn't fuck anyone. I swear I didn't fuck anyone. I went out with the guys Michali wanted us to do something together. I'd already made plans, so there was no way I was going to give in. What a man! I'm sure her version is different. You can only think like an investigator, huh? Let go of work once in a while. Did you fight?Yes. I'm not going home tonight, either.What? We're calling off the wedding.Erez! We're not compatible. What got into you? You're a pair of turtledoves! Doves who crap on each other. Okay, so where do things stand now? I told you. I'm not going home tonight and I need a place to stay. And I think it's time I met your mother.Erez! [ Chuckling ] We need to talk.There's nothing to talk about. I'm serious.There's nothing to talk about. But we're a good fit, Anna. Maybe we should try, I'm telling you. You have a girlfriend you're about to marry. Me, I'm opposed to marriage, but for you, Erez, it'll be good. Good? Anna, we have to try, believe me. No, no. You and her, perfect! Perfect. Truly perfect. You're the opposite of her. You're good for me. We fit. No. Opposites attract. No way! Erez! You're getting married. Don't start with me. [ Cell Phone Rings ] Don't answer now, Anna. Anna, come on. Yes? Yes? Of course! Wherever you like. Okay, see you. What happened?Nimrod agrees to testify. Your gun, please. Your clip. Read this in the meantime. [ Phone Dialing ] Mom, I just talked to Shmuel about the rent. Well, he's difficult, you know. But I told him I'll come over tomorrow to talk. Yes, I told him that for us, $20 isn't what he thinks it is. So please, don't worry. And no need to call all the aunts and grandmothers. Everything will be all right. Take a pill and calm down. Okay, fine. I'll come tonight and we'll talk. [ Beeps Off ] Are you living in a fucking dream, or what? From this huge army you had to pick on Capt. Davidi from 433? Mm-hmm. Explain how the violence you guys used that night was operationally advantageous to us.Who's "us?" The army.What? [ Chuckles ] And you're the army? Yes, Davidi. I'm the army. And the army is investigating you now, in case you haven't yet gotten it into your little brain. Shut your mouth! Shut your mouth, or else! Talk nice! Or what? You'll smash me in the face with the butt of your gun? Like you did on Passover night? Listen, you piece of-- I'm a distinguished officer, get it? Distinguished in officers' course, the brigade, the battalion! You name it! So you pick on me, of all people? Who defends this country? Who eats crap in the Occupied Territories so cunts like you can sit here and fuck with people's brains? I want my commander here, now! Why? Was he there with you? Did you hear me say that? So who gave you the order to act? Or didn't you get authorization from anyone?I want my commander here, now! Why? Did he give you the orders for what you did? I see you're a moron and don't understand a word. Watch your mouth, you're not in that zoo of yours. That zoo lets you sleep in peace at night, little girl. You're shooting the army in the foot, understand? I really wonder whether we're in the same army. My army, Davidi, has a red line that no one crosses! The things you did are unacceptable!Oh, really? Ask yourself who stood in front of 40 people and questioned him! The army, or me? Know how many people were staring at us from the roofs? You don't know. Has anyone ever shot at you? Has anyone ever shot at you? Answer!No. Once you've stood there, at the entrance to an alley, half an hour after our civilians were shot at, you'll talk differently. What's the connection? The connection? I'll explain it to you. I have soldiers in my unit, do you understand that? Or are you a stupid Russian who only came to Israel yesterday? I don't give a fuck about you, nor your commander, nor the entire military police and all the judges in the world. I have fighters I need to bring home alive. Period. So is that why, and I quote, "you smashed the butt of your gun into the face, then your fist in the chest of an older man" who could have been your father? Your raging violence was not justified. You harmed innocent Palestinians.Fuck your Palestinians! Who sent me and my men out there? No one can dare blame us for trying to get home alive. Do you have parents at home? Got a father who sits at home, waiting for you? Do you? Were you trained to interrogate detainees? I've been in this shit for five years. Is there any better training? Only the Security Agency is allowed to interrogate detainees. But they shot at our civilians from there! Did you expect me to tremble in front of 40 crappy Arabs? I had to extract information, fast, and get back to the battalion. That's how the army trained me.You're lying, Davidi! There was no danger. Not to you nor to your men. Your decision was violent and wrong. True, you're a distinguished officer, but you screwed up, and you're going to pay for it. You're going to pay for it. [ Footsteps Approaching ] Michali and I wanted to talk to you. Okay. There's a thing we need to clear up. Yes? I want you to tell Anna-- Anna, I want you to tell Michali that I didn't sleep at your place last night. Anna! Excuse me? What? Say what? Tell her I didn't stay with you last night, and that's it. [ Laughing ] Are you serious? Come on, Anna, tell her! That's ridiculous. The three of us are here. Let's clear this shit up once and for all. What "shit"? I didn't know there was any. That's not the point now. Excuse me. You burst into the room and start a confrontation without telling me anything. Anna, come on. Tell her and get it over with. Erez didn't sleep at my place. There's nothing between us. You can get married, don't worry. You may kiss the bride. Thank you. Send me an invitation to the wedding. Congratulations. [ Laughing ] What's going on? I sleep with the drivers, do you understand? They won't let me into the company. No one's speaking to me. There's graffiti about me on the toilet walls. Yesterday morning, when I got up, I couldn't find my shoes. They're calling me a snitch, an asshole. They wrote they wished I was dead, that Arabs would shit on my grave. And I don't give a shit. But I'm freaked out by not knowing what's happening to me. Understand, I've no problem with the unit and our assignments. If need be, I'll jump on a suicide bomber and neutralize him here, but I don't understand what happened to people who turned on me in a second just because I'm doing what they themselves taught me to do. My crew. Brothers I gave everything for, I stayed on weekends for them, they slept at my parents'. [ Woman On P.A., Indistinct ] As if there were some big secret, and if someone were to disclose it, the angel of death would come! This is going to change your life. It will hurt you. You should know that. No problem. Okay, so tell me more. I have trouble with the fact that now things are done for laughs. Just for the fun of it, see? I come from a combat family, my father was an officer in the paratroopers. My uncles, my cousins, everyone. But there are things I can't keep quiet about. What things? It's scorching hot outside. Someone from my company locks a guy in his car. Just takes the key and leaves him in there, to cook. Or some Arab with his two kids passes by, and one of our guys hits him in the face with his food tray, in front of his kids. See? Or we kill a terrorist. His brother comes to pick up the body. He gets beaten up, gun butts in the face, kicks... His brother just died! It'll be okay. [ Tone Chimes ] I have to see you. Hang on, driver! ♪♪ [ Folk-Rock ] [ Sighs ] ♪♪ [ Man Singing In Hebrew ] ♪♪ [ Stops ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Lock Clicks ] You scared me. You? No one can scare you. You'd be surprised. I wanted to thank you. For what? For that thing with Michali. Okay. Okay? You were great! [ Chuckles ] I'm crazy about you.I have a favor to ask you, too. Sure. I'm afraid I won't finish Davidi's investigation before I leave. Why shouldn't you complete it? I don't know. So if I don't make it, I want you to. Promise me. I'm asking you seriously. Erez, I'm serious now. Fine. We just have to remember who he is, after all. What? Did someone talk to you?No one talked to me. They talked to you! Stop imagining things! What do you mean, "We have to remember who he is?" Did someone call to "remind you?" This investigation made a lot of people nervous. I knew they'd back him up. I told you several times that they watch each other's backs. Fine. So they did talk to you. So they talked to me. What do you care? I also need backing, you know? I need us to watch each other's back too. You're going to let me take the heat myself, huh? If I fall, it's just on me. I thought you understood that from the beginning. You bastard! It's all because of Michali. What's she got to do with it? You know very well. We're getting married. Exactly. What's your problem? I hate you! I hate the way you run things here. You have no trouble asking me to lie to Michali's face. But when I ask you for something, just once, you fuck me over? At least you'll know you tried. "At least you'll know you tried..." What do you want me to say? That you believe in me. That I'm capable. That you trust me. I'm not your father, Anna. I'm not here to give you a hand. I'm your commanding officer! You're right. You're not my father. [ Beeps ] [ Beeps ] [ Davidi ] We're in Hollywood now? Can we start already? Calm down. Don't start off on the wrong foot! [ Chimes ] I stress that both parties agree to this confrontation. Let's begin. You were supposed to enter the village, determine where the shots came from, and seize arms. - Right. - And then? And then nothing. I've already told you a thousand times. We stopped the first vehicle that exited the neighborhood. They seemed suspicious, we questioned them, everything was fine, and we moved on. But not before you smashed the guy's face. I have no idea what you're talking about. Nothing happened. That's not what Nimrod says.Fine, he can say what he likes. He and his Arab buddies. Let's continue. You pulled the guy out of his car, and hit him in the face with your gun. He bled--Not accurate. First I did the normal procedure, checked the trunk, asked them who's in the car, where they're going, and then he screamed at me, said I'm asking like a pussy. Only then did he go over and--Fuck you, motherfucker! You piece of shit! You traitor![ Anna ] Davidi, calm down! Shame on you, dissing your CO![ Nimrod ] You're not my CO! Not anymore! Anyone who acts like that is no CO of mine! Forget it. Know what? This is my mistake. I should have known from the start that you're a traitor, a dog, and kicked you out of the battalion. You lefty piece of shit! Screw you! I have no trouble serving in the Occupied Territories, or doing this, if needed. But to push a guy against his car, hit him with the butt of a gun, crack his face wide open, in front of his wife and kids? Is that right-wing? Is that being a patriot? So go live with them, you shit! Now you play the hero. Now, not out there! Now! Next you'll want a fucking prize. Do you even get how absurd this is? How do you explain your behavior? I've explained a thousand times. This is the last time I'll repeat it. In these situations, you must exert maximum pressure and get out, otherwise you're putting your men at risk. He doesn't understand that. He's just a soldier, and a stupid one, too. He's used to having things done for him, and this is the thanks we get. What don't I understand? Why'd you punch the old man in the chest? A bunch of people came over, that's what caused the whole mess! And what did you do? You stood there and stared at us, instead of helping us. Help?[ Anna ] You thought violence would bring results? Who used violence? It was aggression. [ Anna ] Where's the line between aggression and abuse? "We're good people, we have no guns, nothing," you punched him in the face again and kneed him in the stomach? So I went to pull away the older guy who came to separate them, but Davidi didn't like that, so he ran, punched him in the chest, and the old guy stopped breathing. Know what started this for me? That night, in the battalion, they joked about it, and you kept quiet. You said nothing! All night I thought about that kid in the car who saw it all. Do you even remember the kid? Do you? Huh? So tell me, who's the shit here? Me? Or someone who beats up a guy who did nothing, in front of his kid? "Sir!" We were in terrible danger, down there. I knew that if I acted quickly I could return with arms. Arms? From the family in the car? Of course! Know how many times I stopped vehicles and was told, "No! We didn't do anything! We're good people!" And after a few "caresses" I got arms and bullets and pipe-bombs and God knows what! So who's naive here? What if I saved civilian lives that day? Your life and his parents' lives? - It's a war out there! - But your violence wasn't necessary! That's what you think. Check your documents. In the three months since then, there've been no shootings in the area. Did anyone think of that? Maybe you don't mind, but some people can't live with that. So they can go demonstrate by the separation wall! As the commander, I exercised my professional discretion in a violent area, in a threatening situation. Go in, get out. That's what the army taught me! I have nothing against you, just against your action. So write everything down, sign it, - or it will end much worse. - Think I give a damn about your threats? Is all the mess in the Occupied Territories my fault? You caught me and want to blame me for all the shit in the world? [ Slams Table ]Fuck you! Davidi, calm down and sit. Turn off the camera. Why? Because. Turn it off.I can't. You can't?No. So get him out of here. Anna. Every questioning includes some slapping around. Punches in the face, as a deterrent. You have to educate them to have respect, so they're afraid. It's completely accepted. Even that morning when I was with the battalion commander at one of the roadblocks, I saw exactly what he does. What does he do?What? It's not just the battalion commander. Forget it. Doesn't matter. I don't even know why this is happening to me. Never mind. I just can't believe it. Go on. Next week is my 24th birthday. Great present you got for me. Thanks a lot! The army functions according to laws.That's exactly the point! Those laws don't protect us!Excuse me? Us! Your fucking laws don't protect us, the guys out in the Occupied Territories. Did you know I lost a soldier in Gaza? Did you? No, I'm sorry. Every Friday before I drive home, I go to his family, and every Friday I see his mother fading away in front of my eyes! Every day, every hour! I chase people, they throw rocks, even refrigerators at me, from the roofs. They shoot at me! Nearly five years I've devoted to this shit! Once, my force stopped a suicide bomber on the way to Jerusalem. Stopped him at a roadblock, with an explosive belt. So what? This doesn't count for anything now? You come after me for a fucking slap? It's not the slap. That was just what got you caught. Okay, so maybe I was too aggressive in the situation. The guy gave me some lip, but so what? What's changed now?A soldier reported you! He ratted. Correction!Reported! That's what the army expects from its fighters. Suddenly you don't like it? I'm as loyal as a dog to this battalion. I built it up. And I'll stay that way even if you kill me. What... now... the whole of the army will know about this, right? We pass the material on to the military attorney general. Who else? Your brigade commander, your commanding general and the general staff. The press? You're killing me, do you understand? Killing me. You're strong, Davidi.What do you know about me? That you love your country. You sure I don't need a lawyer for this? Look, if you go on like this and we prove otherwise, and we will prove it, you'll get two years for perjury.Two years? Did you think an officer can lie in court? What... What do I do? Write here. "I, Davidi, ID number, confess to all accusations cited in the investigation," and sign. And then? Then I'll write up everything in the final report. They look at it differently, when--Are you out of your mind? They'll kick me out of the army. Maybe not. They care about you. They care about me?Yes. Sure they care about me. [ Sighs ] You realize what we're doing now is rewarding our enemies? It's a reward for our justice, for all of us. Here. I did what was expected of me, right? Be strong, Davidi. Yeah, right. I'll be strong. [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Exhales Deeply ] Tomorrow you finish the army, huh? So how does it feel? Weird. A bit scary. It'll be weird--I'm glad you came. It'll be weird, that you won't be at the trial. I've done my job. It's over. I think I'll go away. Really? Go for it! Go traveling. I'd love to come with you. I can't go back to the battalion. I have no friends left there. It'll be okay. You'll be okay. I'm really glad to see you. Remember how it all began? [ Chuckles ] With Confino's Toyota? It seems like ten years have passed since. From the beginning I had a good feeling about you. What? [ Erez ] Davidi shot himself. When? A few hours ago. Where is he? How is he? He's dead, Anna. He killed himself. I was there. He left a letter. I should have known. I told you this thing could turn into a mess. Erez... What? It's not my fault the jerk shot himself. Will there be an investigation? Yes. Not you. No, not me. Who? I don't know. Tomorrow I'm being discharged from the army. You are not. The Major General asked that you stay here. What, am I under arrest? You have nowhere to run, Anna. You're better off dealing with it now than dragging it into civilian life. When is he coming? Who?The guy the general is sending. He's not sending anyone. He's coming here himself. [ Breathes Deeply ] Give me your gun, please. [ Clicks ] I was alone when I found the letter. No one knows but us. [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Footsteps Departing ] [ Door Opens ] The Major General.Where's Erez? [ Footsteps Approaching ] Leave. [ Door Closes ] Sit down. What happened here? Sir, in the field things look different than what you see. Did I ask you what we see or what we don't? The things I saw in the field, someone like you would never get to see! That's not what I mean. What do you mean? That you-- That I what? Sit in the university and read books about the army? I didn't say that. Then what are you trying to say? That I don't know my officers or my soldiers? I know exactly what goes on in that brigade. I created it. I know each and every fighter, I know what he keeps in his flak jacket, what he has for breakfast, when he masturbates... Tomorrow the Chief of Staff will announce an investigation. Do you understand how far you pushed this? I'm sorry.Now you're sorry. I formulated one single code for this battalion: No violence, period!But-- In any situation! - Davidi himself mentioned violence. - What violence? And I have testimonies. [ Slams Table ]Testimonies, my ass! Who do you think you are? Think this is your daddy's army? Do you know how much I invest in each one of these officers? Do you know the damage caused by losing someone like him? - I know, sir. - And you get a confession from him! What confession? That he hit some fucking Arab in the face? Even if it's true, and let's assume that it is, do you understand what damage you caused the army? Maybe it's not just because of the investigation. What then? Davidi himself told me he'd been under pressure for years. Violent pressure. What do you want? Excuse me? You want to go to law school after the army? I thought so, yes. Now look me in the eye. The soldier who dealt drugs, the major who stuck his fingers into his assistant's cunt, the border police guy who sold grenades to Hamas, those cases weren't challenging enough for you? You can imagine what your service record will say. I don't care about that. Suddenly you don't care about that! May I ask what exactly you're accusing me of? I want to know what happened here. I've told you everything. It's all documented in the file. Why can't I believe you?About what? About the guidelines, the orders, the events. I want to know everything! He didn't tell me anything. I'm going to fuck you over! You want to bring me down? Me? You're mistaken about me, sir. The word "mistake" does not exist for me. Never has.It's hard for me, too. It's much harder for Davidi's mother. [ Sobbing ] He chose to be a victim, sir. Right till the end. I had a mission, and I fulfilled it. I fulfilled it, sir.
