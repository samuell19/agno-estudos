[MUSIC PLAYING] -Sorry, guys. We're closed. -Well, now, that's not what your sign out front says. -Yeah, [INAUDIBLE], we closed 20 minutes ago. -Yeah, Brett, he's right. Come on. Let's go someplace else. -No. I want service. -Guys, we're closed for the night. -Well, how about we serve ourselves? -Let's just go. -Shut up. -Brett, let's just go. Come on. Maybe we should leave. -Hey, I-I don't want any trouble. --[LAUGHING] We don't want any trouble either. We just want faggots like you out of our town. -Somebody's coming. Let's go. Hi, Mr. Ross. -Mr. Ross. -You boys staying out of trouble? -Trying to. -We-- we just came by to say hello to Adam. -Why don't you come back tomorrow when we're open? -Yes sir. -Yes sir. -Night, guys. Adam, could I have a word with you? -Sure. -Got a minute? -Yeah, sure, Mr. Ross. -I'm bringing in some new help. -Oh, that's great. We sure could use it around here. -Well, I'd like for you to show him the ropes. -Sure. When does he start? -Tomorrow. -OK. -Good. [COUGHING] -Mr. Ross, sit down. -[COUGHING] -Here, sit down. Do you want me to call a doctor? -Water. [COUGHING] -Thank you. Adam, how long have you worked here? -Since high school. -I want you to take care of some things for me. -I am. -I know. I can trust you. -I know. -Why don't you help me up? I'll give you a ride home. -OK. Just let me put this away, and I'll be right there. -OK. [KNOCKING] -I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh, jeez. -Hi. -Oh, jeez. -Bob. -Oh, son. -How are you? -I'm glad you made it. Glad you were able to make it. -This is my girlfriend Nina. -Hi. -Oh, it's a pleasure, Nina. -Nice to meet you. -It's a pleasure. -Lot of memories here. This is where I grew up. -Oh, it's very cozy. And a beautiful view out there. -Yes it is. Um, when Anthony's mom died, she, uh, insisted I keep the place like she did. Clean. As you can see, I've not done much of a good job. -Do you have the keys? -OK. Yeah. Here. -So how's your health? -To tell you the truth, not good. Uh, I'm hanging in there. -I know you are. -Here. Let me get this for you here. I'll show you to your room. -Thank you, Mr. Ross. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Thank you. -So what was so urgent, Dad? -Anthony, how's school? -School's fine, but I know you didn't have me drive all this way just to ask me that, did you? -No I didn't. You're right. -How's the diner? -That's what I want to talk to you about. -How's Adam? Is he still there, or? -Yeah, yeah. He's still there. -So what's going on? -Anthony, Adam's mom had bypass surgery a couple months ago. She's fragile, and in need of medicine and attention. I don't know how to say this, but Adam's been loyal to me ever since he started at the diner. He's never called in sick, always been on time, never been late. Just lately, I've been missing money from the diner. -You think he's stealing from you? -That-- that's putting it rather harsh. Now, I don't have any proof of that. So that's why I called you, so you could help me figure it out. -So you want me to confront him? -Not exactly. I-I want you to help him. You know, I told him I'd be bringing in some new help for a couple days. -Dad, he knows who I am. -No, Anthony, he doesn't know you. He only knows your name. He's never seen you. You've been, what, to college, what, four years? -Yeah, but, I mean, so you want me to pretend I'm somebody else? -Just for a day or two. -Dad, when mom was still alive, I mean, you never wanted me around the diner. Now you're asking me to work there? -I'm not doing too good. I can't keep up like I used to. Yeah, I only have you, son. -When do I start? -Tomorrow. It was a long drive. I'd better get to bed. -Thanks, son. Oh, and Anthony? -Yeah? -I want you to keep this between both of us. I'm not accusing anyone of anything. -I know, I know. Good night, Dad. -Night. Thanks for coming. -Yeah. -Hey. -Hey. -You have a great place. -Yes. -I've never been in a cabin before. Your dad's a real sweetheart. -Yeah, I guess. -How long has he lived her? -As long as I can remember, really. He inherited the place from my grandfather. It's kind of the family jewel. It's kind of all he's got. -Wow. Must be a lot of history here. -Yeah. Several generations. -Did you tell him yet? -No. -Anthony. -I will. Listen. -When is it gonna be the right time if it's not now? -You know my father has an eighth grade education. -I know. -OK? He worked his ass off to send me to college. -I know. -It's like the height of his existence. -I know. -OK? We're here for a few days, right? So give it some time, and when the time is right. OK? -OK. I love you. -I love you, too. Don't forget this. -I won't. I'm folding your clothes, jeez. -We should get some rest. -Are you Adam? -Yeah. You must be the new guy? -Yeah. Winston. For a few days. -Nice to meet you. Let me just set this down, and I-- and I'll give you the tour. -Sure. [MUSIC PLAYING] -This is my favorite place. -It's interesting. -I come here every day. I love being around nature. -What else do you like? -I don't know. Listening to the radio, watching TV. -So how's the diner doing? -It's fine, I guess. I mean, Mr. Ross has been having me run it for years now, and it's still standing, so. -Are there any money problems, or? -What do you mean? Not that I know of. I mean, Mr. Ross isn't doing too well, so I deposit his checks, pay his bills, do most of his accounting. -I see. Well, it's a good sandwich. -Thanks. It's my favorite. So tell me about you. -What do you want to know? -Do you have a girlfriend, or? -No. Why do you ask? -Just wondering. -You? -No. I'm-- I'm gay. No one knows. I'm sure they suspect, but. -And you're telling me this because? -Because I like you. -I respect that, but Adam, I'm not gay. -I know, I know. I just thought-- I just thought the best way to start a friendship is with honesty. -And I have nothing against-- -Gay people, as long as they don't bother you? -That's not what I was gonna say. -That's all right. I mean, I've always been the one to get pushed around and harassed. It doesn't really bother me. -Who harasses you? -No one, really. I mean, just some guys that come in the diner once in awhile. I think their parents are really religious, so. -Why don't you tell somebody? -They're harmless. They're all bark and no bite. -I guess. Well, we should get back. -Hey, Winston. Thanks for helping us out. -Not a problem. -If it's OK with you, I prefer if Mr. Ross didn't know about-- -It'll be our little secret. OK. -All right. -Morning. -Morning. Hey, you didn't have to do that. -Oh, please. I'm more than happy to help here. Oh, there's water on for tea. -Oh, good. So, Nina, you from around here? -No. Actually, I'm from Gary, Indiana. Ever heard of it? No. -How did you and Anthony meet? -Uh, we were introduced by a mutual friend. Mm, this is gonna be good. -Yeah. Oh, it's those strange kids. -What are they doing? -Well, Brett, he-- he thinks he's a priest. --[LAUGHING] And what about the other two? -His conversation. -Pretty small congregation, if you ask me. -They come around here often, and I see them all the time, but I just don't have any idea where they live. -Huh. -Keep reading. -And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, a basket of summer fruit. Then said the Lord unto me, the end has come upon my people of Israel. I will not again pass by them anymore. And the songs of the temple shall be howling in that day, sayeth the Lord God. There shall be many dead bodies in every place. They shall cast them forth with silence. Amos, chapter eight, verse two and three. -Brett, can we take a break? You've been reading the bible for over an hour now. -Yeah, I'm hungry. -Why don't we go to the diner? -Yeah. Let's do that. -I hope you like your sausage well done. Sorry. -Oh, that's OK. No problem. It smelled good when you were making it. -It's pretty good. Tasty. -I want to share something with you. When Anthony's mother died, I didn't know what to do. I always was at the diner, and so he practically raised himself. -Well, I think you did a pretty good job. I mean, you got a great son. -Thank you. How long have you two been dating? -Oh, just a little over a year now. -I was Anthony's age when I-- I fell in love with his mother. We met at the store, and she was shopping with her mother. And I-- oh, God, I could hardly keep my eyes off her. So I mustered up the courage to go talk to her. -What did you say? -Well, I said hello. -Anthony knows he's got a great dad. He loves you so much. -Yeah. We were a family of three brothers and a sister. I was the oldest of three, and our parents were involved in a car crash. They both died. I was in the eighth grade. It was devastating. So I had to drop out of school to get a job to put food on the table. And before my mother took her last breath in the hospital, she made me promise to keep the family together. So I was very adamant about Anthony going to college and getting his degree. I didn't care what he studied, as long as he got that piece of paper. -He's working on it. You know, these things take time. -I want you to promise me one thing. That you'll be good to him. -I promise. -He's a good boy. I know he likes you. -I will. -Thank you. Thank you. -[LAUGHTER] -I saw what you did. -Winston, let it go. It's my problem. -No. Apologize to him. -Why don't you make me? -If I have to, I will. -Oh. Look, boys. Our little fruit has a fly. -Get the fuck out of here. I never want to see you around here again. -Oh, Nina, you don't have to do that. -Mr. Ross, I told you I don't mind. Now just sit back and relax and let me take care of this, OK? -OK. -I was thinking that we might all go to dinner tonight. What do you think? -Well, that sounds like a great idea. -Yeah? OK. Why don't I call Adam? -No, no, no, no, no. No. Don't. I mean, don't bother. I might be an old man, but I still know how to use one of these things here. -OK. [PHONE RINGING] -Al's Diner. This is Adam. Oh, hey, Mr. Ross. -Uh, how's the new guy doing? Yeah, he's great. Do you want to talk to him? -Sure, sure, put him on. -OK. Hold on. Telephone. -This is Winston. -So that's the name you're going by? -Yeah. -Well, Nina wanted me to give you a call, and, um, she invited us all out to go out to dinner this evening. -I'll be there. OK. -Have you found out anything? -Yeah. Everything's fine. Yeah, I'll make sure everything is back where it belongs. OK, Mr. Ross. Yeah. -OK. See you later. Bye. -Bye bye. -I, uh, I put in a good word for you. -Thanks. -Hey, I don't know if you have any plans after work, but I was thinking maybe we could go-- -You know what? Tonight I kind of do. Maybe tomorrow. -Yeah, tomorrow's cool. -You know what? I'm exhausted. I think I'm gonna get out of here. -Yeah, I'm sure you're not used to working in a diner all day, huh? -Not really. -That's all right. I'll close up here and I'll see you tomorrow. -Bright and early. -Thanks for sticking up for me back there. -Don't worry about it. [PHONE RINGING] -Al's Diner. This is Adam. Oh, hey, Monica. Yeah, I'm free tonight. Yeah, dinner sounds good. Where? OK. Yeah, just give me a few minutes to finish up here, and I'll meet you over there. -Glad you were able to make it, son. -So what's going on with this Adam guy, anyway? -Can I tell him? My dad thinks this guy Adam, who works for him, is stealing. -Why would he think that? -The books are off balance. -Adam's worked for me quite some time, and I'm not gonna pass any judgment until Anthony's figured out what's really going on. -So when do I get to meet this Adam guy? -Hey, Mr. Ross. -Adam. -Hey, Winston. -Winston? Who's Winston? -This is Winston. -Oh, you mean Anthony? Oh, you must be Adam. Oh, uh, pleasure to meet you. My name's Nina. I've heard so much about you. It, uh-- you guys must have already met before. -Anthony? -Yeah. This is my boyfriend Anthony, and, uh, this is his dad. I guess you probably already know him because you work for him. -This is your dad? You were spying on me? -Adam, I'm sorry. -You think I'm stealing from you, so you sent your son to check up on me? -Let me explain, Adam. -There's nothing to explain. I quit. -Let-- let me out. -Did I miss something? Oh my God. -Adam, hold up. -I'm not a thief. I never stole a dime from your dad, ever! -Adam, I know. It's not you. It's me. I can explain, though. -Explain to your dad. I don't care. I'm done. Four years! Four years of my life I invested in that place, and this is the thanks I get? -Adam, please let me explain. -What? What? What does everyone want from me? -I'm sorry. -I need the money, OK? But I didn't steal anything, I swear. -I know. -What am I gonna do now? I gotta take care of my mom. Without this job, I have nothing. -Adam, I am sorry. I am really sorry. This whole mess is my fault. I don't know what to say. -I gotta-- I gotta go. I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do. -Adam, where are you gonna go? -I don't know, but I can't-- I can't go back now. -Listen to me. You did nothing wrong. I know. -What makes you so sure? -Because I'm the one who's been taking the money. -Why? -I haven't been upfront about school. -You're not going to school? -I am in school, but it's not the school my dad thinks I'm in. -Why not tell him? Why let him think it's me? -Because I was afraid. -Afraid of what? -I was afraid he wouldn't understand, Adam. He's always-- you know my dad. He's always had this picture of me going to college, and if he finds out, it's going to make him sick. I've always been the perfect one. The golden boy. -He's probably sick right now thinking I'm the one who's stealing from him. -I know, and I'm sorry. Adam, please. You've got to understand. I am sorry. -What was that? -I don't know. I better go. I will fix everything. I promise. Please don't quit. I'll see you at work tomorrow. -Honey. We were worried about you. -Where's Adam? Is he OK? -He's fine, Dad. We need to talk. -What? What do you mean? -Pop, the truth is-- -What? You're not pregnant, are you? --[LAUGHING] Nothing like that, no. -What is it? -The truth is, I'm not really in college. -What? What do you mean? -I am attending detective school, and Adam isn't the one who's bee taking the money. I've been withdrawing the money from your account because school is more than you originally budgeted for. -I-I've been blaming Adam all along, and you're the one who's been taking the money? Why did you lie to me? -Dad, I-- I didn't know how to tell you. I was afraid you wouldn't understand. -[BREATHING HEAVILY] -Pop? -Mr. Ross? -Dad? -Are you OK? -Inhaler's in my pocket. -Dad. -Here. -Give him his pills. Pop? You all right? -Don't worry, my boy. I've known them for a long time. I know Mr. Ross is a good person. I've known him for many, many years. -Dad, how are you feeling? -I need to see Adam, please. I need to see Adam. [PHONE RINGING] -I'll get it. Hello? Yeah? -Who is it? Yeah, what's-- what's wrong with him? -Oh my God. -OK. OK, I'll be right over. -Is he all right? -I don't know. Mr. Ross needs me, though. I need to go. -OK. Come back. -I'll be-- I'll be back as soon as I can. -OK. -You gonna be OK? -OK. -All right. -Maybe we should call a doctor. -No, no, no. No doctors. I've had enough doctors. -Dad, are you sure? -I need to see Adam. -He's on his way over. -Good. -Why don't I go make some tea, OK? -OK. -I'll be back. -Anthony, I'm not mad at you. As a matter of fact, I'm proud that you stuck to your word. You're in school studying something you like. That's important, son. -Yeah. -I know you never liked the country. I-- I don't find it hard to understand where you're coming from. When my father was alive, I always thought I had to please him. I thought that if I ever done anything wrong, he'd stop loving me. But now, as a parent, I know that you can never stop loving your son, regardless. -Dad, I'm sorry I lied to you. I was just-- I was afraid you'd be disappointed. -Listen to me, son. I-- I want this house to stay in the family. Adam has been as good as family to me. He's-- he's watched over me for several years. That's why I want him to have this house. -Whatever. -I know this place is not for you. -Dad, you need to get some rest, OK? -I'd like a word with Adam. -He's on his way. How are you doing? -Hey, Adam's here. Here's some tea. -I'd like a word with Adam. -Hi, Mr. Ross. -Adam, my boy, I'm sorry I doubted you. -It's OK, Mr. Ross. -No, no, no. It's not OK. I-- I want-- I need you to know I'm thankful for everything you've ever done for me. That's why I'd like for you to stay in the house. It's a-- it's a good house. It's been in the family for generations. It's given me everything I ever wanted, and that's why-- that's why I want you to stay here. -Rest, Mr. Ross. Everything's gonna be fine. -No, no, it's not gonna be fine. It's just not. It's not. It's-- I need you. Anthony's going away to school. [COUGHING] -Mr. Ross, relax. You're going to be getting as good as new in no time. You'll be running the business just like you always did. Now it's time to get some rest, OK? -Mm-hm. -I'll come by and see you again tomorrow. Get some rest, OK? -Hey. -Yeah. I know I don't really know you, but, um, I wanted to let you know how sorry that we are about the misunderstanding. Anthony should have told his father a really long time ago about the school situation We're sorry. -I never meant to hurt you. I-- you know, I hope you can forgive us, my father and I. -Well, I-- I love Mr. Ross like my own dad. He's been-- he's been really good to me and my mom. So I'll be back at work first thing. -It's my last day, but I hope we can celebrate. -Yeah. That'll be good. -Yeah. Uh, good night. -Night. -Night. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ding dong. -Hey, baby. -Hey. -Listen, um, why don't you all go out and get a beer or something? Relax? I'll finish up here. -All right. You sure? -Yeah, no problem. I insist. Y'all have been working hard, so get out of here. -Let's go get a beer. -Oh, wait. Before you go. Here. Come on. Smile. OK. Great. Very nice. Sexy. Beautiful. Gorgeous. Rock it. OK. Go. -Adam? So what's it like? -What's what like? -I feel weird saying this, but being with another man. -I don't know. It's probably like being with anyone. I mean, the plumbing's different, but the emotions are the same. -What would you say if I've always been curious? -What stopped you? -I don't-- I-- fear? -Fear of what? -What would happen next. -You mean physically? -I don't even know. Physically, emotionally. -I'm gonna miss you. -You know, you shouldn't leave your dad alone. -You know, I-- I try not to. I won't. -You don't know how long he's gonna be around. You should come by more often. -You know, with school, I work two jobs, I have Nina, you know? I-- I try, but it's just so difficult. -Yeah, I know. I know what you mean. I took my dad for granted until he died, and I just hope you don't make the same mistake. -I won't. -Dad. Pop. We gotta go. -OK. I love you, son. -Love you, too. -Take care of yourself. -I will. -Watch out for my boy. -Don't worry. He's taken care of. -We'll try to get back here as soon as we can, OK? Get some rest. -God bless. Drive safely. -Good bye. It was so nice meeting you. -Mr. Ross, I gotta get going too. So is there anything else you need before I leave? -No. I'll be fine. Thanks, Adam. -OK. -Bye, Pop. Love you. -Hey. Keep an eye on my dad, will you? -I will. I will, I promise. -Thank you. -Thank you, Adam. Come here. It was so nice meeting you. Take care, OK? -I will. -I'll see you soon. -Sure. -Let's get out of here. -He was a good man. -Yeah. -Taught me a lot. Where's Nina? -Adam, we're not getting along. We're separating. -Sorry to hear that. -It's OK. It's not your fault. -Look at you. You made-- you're a detective. -Yeah. -You know, your dad was always really proud of you, Anthony. -Adam, what are you gonna do with the house? I mean, he left it to you for good reason. It's-- it's funny. He knew I never wanted to live here. I never liked the country. He knew that. -I missed you. -I missed you too. -I thought about you practically every day. I can't get you out of my mind. -Adam, this is your house now. -It's yours, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'll be late tonight. -We had plans, remember? -I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. -When, Anthony? -I have to work. -You always have to make up for something, and you never do, because you're always working. If it's not your job, it's your divorce. -Well, you know what? I kind of have to take care of that to be here with you. -Well, you're taking me for granted. -No I'm not. -Yeah you are. First I'm stuck like a hermit in the middle of the woods, and then you expect me to just be ready and available whenever you show up. And the only reason why is because you're afraid for us to be seen in public together. -You know I love you. -Well, how about showing it once in a while? -I do. -And not with words. With actions. -I do. -Anthony, I love you too, but I'm tired of this. I feel like I'm drowning, and you're not making any attempt to save me. I can't go on anymore like this. -I'm sorry. Listen. You knew from the start it wouldn't be easy. You knew my situation. I work for the fucking police department, for God's sakes. I cannot be out and about with my male lover, and you know that. How do you think it's going to look if the other guys found out about it? How long do you think I'd last? -I guess not that long. -I'll call you. -I love you. -I know. -Bye bye. -Look, boys. We got ourselves here a faggot house. Got couple faggots in there fornicating. They're going to hell, boys. Going to hell. -Absolutely. -We are here to celebrate the union between this man and this man, who are already married in holy matrimony. [LAUGHING] What's that verse, Roger? -About the fags? -Where's the Bible? Take it out. -Stupid. Stupid. -Shut the fuck up. -Like you're so fucking-- -Stop your fighting, like you're so fucking smart. -High school dropout. Fuckups. -If a man also lie with mankind as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. Faggots! Faggots. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Can't stand those goddamn sinners and what they're doing in that cabin. -Somebody oughta teach them a fucking lesson. -You guys wanna play a little prank? -What are you talking about? -Show those sinners what God has waiting for them in hell. -What do you have in mind? -Nothing too heavy. Just gonna have some fun. Follow me. -[INAUDIBLE]! Which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel. -What are you doing in my house? -Look what we've got here, boys! -Let go of me! -Shut up. Shut up! -Get the tape. Get the tape! It's in that drawer! Come on! -This was not supposed to happen. -Shut the fuck up. Shit! -Get him in here. -[INAUDIBLE]. -That's good. That's good. I got something for him. -Yes. This is an emergency. Uh, come quickly. I'm hearing a crime taking place at the cabinet of Albert Ross. -Romans 1, Verse 27. And likewise, also the men leaving the natural use of a woman burned in their lust one toward another. Men with men, working that which is unseemingly, and receiving in themselves a recompense the errors of-- -Brett, stop. -Shut the fuck up! And even though they do not lecture [INAUDIBLE] in their knowledge-- -Brett, stop! -To do those things, which are not good-- -Shut up! You fucking killed him! -He's fucking faking it. He's faking it. -He's done. He's not breathing. -Oh, shit. What are we gonna do? We're going to jail. -Shut up. -I can't go to fucking jail! -Shut up! Shut up! No one's going to jail! Shut the fuck up! -What are we gonna do, Brett? -David, get trash bags. We are not-- we are not going to jail. We're not going to jail, because they're not gonna find the body. [PHONE RINGING] -This is Detective Ross. What's the address? [POLICE SIRENS] -So this is a wonderful space for the newlyweds. It's fully furnished. Probably needs a little cosmetic repairs, but other than that, it's a great getaway. And you're getting it at a great price, too. -We'll take it. -We love it. We needed a change of pace from the city. It's very cozy. -So I just need you to just pass by my office and finish filling out a couple paperwork, and, um, we should be OK. -Sounds good. I'll be there first thing in the morning. -I'll see you tomorrow. OK. -Thanks. -Hm. -Isn't this wonderful? It's got so much character. -It does. Our own country cabin. All we have to do is get the phone installed, and we should be set. -Who do you think lived here before? -I don't know, but they must have been creative. -Why do you say that? -Because I saw some canvases and some painting supplies out in the old tool shed. -Does it matter? I love it. -And I love you. -I'll start unpacking the car. -I'll be out in a second. Eerie. -Babe? Our first night here. How exciting. Want some water? -No, uh, I'm fine. -I think tomorrow I'll go to the phone company so they can install the line. -That was great. -You were wonderful. -Mark? Mark? [PHONE RINGING] -Hello? Hello? -I swear I heard the phone ringing. I told you. I got up out of bed to see, and it was unplugged. I'm on my way home now. I just came from the phone company, and they registered the line as off. Uh-huh. I don't know! Oh my God. I have to call you back. Oh my God. Mister, are you all right? God, what have I done? -Please wake up. -What happened? -Mark, I didn't see him. I was talking to you on the phone, and then I heard this thump in front of my car, and I stop, and I think I hit him. What should I do? -He's alive. Get me a pillow. -Oh, thank God he's OK. -Mister, are you all right? What was he doing out there in the woods? -I don't know! There's nothing out there. -Mister, would you like me to call you a doctor? -Maybe we should. You know, he looks fine, but you never know. -OK, get me a blanket. -Mark, I feel so bad. What do we do? -All we can do now is wait and see. -I'm scared. -It's all right, honey. It was an accident. -I did flee the scene of an accident. Do you think he'll press charges? -Let's just concentrate on getting him better. Should I call a doctor? -Stop. I don't need a doctor. -What's your name? -Are you all right? -Water. -I am so sorry about this. -Are you from around here? -Is there anything I can do to help? -We don't want any trouble. We're new in the area. -I feel dizzy. -Please, relax as long as you need to. -Yeah. Don't worry. If there's anything we can do, we-- we'll be in the next room, all right? -So what next? -I-- I don't know. We just wait and see? -Shouldn't we offer him something? -Helen, this guy could be a fugitive. Or-- or worse. Maybe he's like, a child molester or serial killer. -Mark, he's not a fugitive. I saw great sadness in his eyes! I think there's a lot more to him! -Of course. You just met the guy, remember? -You want some dinner? -No. I've lost my appetite. I can't eat with some stranger in the house that my wife nearly killed. -Hey, he'll be OK. We'll be OK. -I hope so. I'm-- I'm gonna go for walk. I just need to get my thoughts around this. -Well, do you want me to come with you? -No. That's-- that's OK. You should stay and make sure that, you know-- in case he needs anything, or something like that, all right? -You're welcome to borrow any of my husband's clothes, if you want. There's some in the drawer. -Yeah. That would be nice. Thank you. -I made you breakfast. -Good. -I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't see you. -Do you have any honey? -Excuse me? -Honey? I like it on my toast. -Sure. Be right back. -Thank you. -My husband's still asleep. -So you guys new to the area? -Yeah, we just bought the place. It was in foreclosure, so we got it really cheap. It's taking me a while to get used to it, but I love it here. We're city people, for the most part. My husband's in real estate, so he got a great deal on the cabin from one of his colleagues. Uh, I don't suppose you live around here. -I used to. -Where do you live now? -Around. -So I think the real estate agent said that the guy who owned this place died, and that he had this restaurant that went out of business right after his passing. And when-- and when his mom heard the news of his death, she had a heart attack and died the same day. What a tragic story, isn't it? How tragic. I think he also said that the guy was a detective. Or a painter. One of the two. I can't remember. And he had this really bitter divorce and lost everything. I don't know. I think that's the story. I'm not quite sure. Something like that. -You know what? People love to talk, and most of the time, they don't know the full story. -True. So what's your story? -Prefer not to talk about it. -Would you like more coffee? -No, I'm fine, miss. -Oh, please. Call me Helen. -You know, I know what you guys are trying to do. I'm not gonna press charges or anything like that. -I'm relieved to hear that. Is there anything that my husband or I can do for you? -Actually, there is. -Whatever you'd like. -I'd like to work around the property. -You want to do yard work? -Or just simple maintenance. -Well, the only problem is we can't afford that right now. -I'd work for free. Just let me stay in the tool shed to the back, and, uh, I promise I won't bother you guys. -I don't see why that would b ea problem. We could use the help around here. -If it's OK with you and your husband, of course. -Done. I'll talk to him. I'm not gonna ask any questions until you're ready, but eventually, I will want to know what you were doing wandering around out there. And the only reason why I ask is because there's nothing out here but this old cabin. -Better move into the tool shed before your husband wakes up. -Right this way. -Jeez. Oh, you scared me. -Sorry. I didn't mean to. So, I've talked to our guest. -And? -And he has only one request. -You didn't offer him money, did do? -No. Actually, what he offered isn't that bad. He wants to live in the tool shed and do work around the house. -Why would he want to do that? -I don't know, but I said it wouldn't be a problem. -So how long is he gonna stay for? -I don't know. -Well, at least we don't have to pay him off. -Come on. We could use the help. -OK. But only until the end of the month, and you have to tell him. -I will. -Feeling better? -As good as expected. -That's good. Hey, my name's Mark. -Anthony. -Nice to meet you. Uh, hey, I'm late for a meeting, so maybe we can talk later? -Sure. -All right. Hey, thanks for the help. -Not a problem. [DOOR OPENING] -Honey? Are you there? I'm in the kitchen. Mark? Anthony? Mark? Anthony? [PHONE RINGING] -Anthony! Anthony! [SOBBING] -It's OK. It's OK. -[SOBBING] I thought you were at the door. I-- I swear I locked it. [SOBBING] And then I go back, and the door was open. What's going on here? -I'll make some tea. It'll make you feel better, OK? -Thank you. When I was small, I used to see things that most people couldn't. I used to see children playing in my backyard all the time. They looked so happy playing. No one else could see them. -You sure of what you saw? -Absolutely. I saw them every day. I'd wake up and I'd want to play with them. When I asked my mom about them, she said there were no children. But these kids used to play in our backyard every day at the same time. -And nobody else could see them? -Apparently not. I did ask our neighbor. This old man who lived by himself. He knew about the children. He said that long before our house was built, there was a grade school that burned down in the exact same place, killing all the children and teachers. He said no one escaped. And then he showed me the newspapers with the headlines. -You remember all this from your childhood? -Like it was yesterday. I could see these children playing, but no one else could. Our house was built on a graveyard of children. I never told anyone that. -Why? -Because I didn't want anyone to think I was crazy. -I don't think you're crazy, but I think you have a gift. -Well, I wish I didn't. It scares me sometimes. Our first night here, I was asleep and heard the phone ringing. And it turns out we hadn't even installed the line yet. Someone is trying to get a hold of me in this cabin. It's a man. Something happened here. -What do you see? -I can't see much, but it's blurry. It comes and goes. -Helen, you've gotta help me. Please tell me what you see. -You lived here, didn't you? -I'll be in the tool shed cleaning. -Anthony, it's OK. [RADIO SOUNDS] -Mark. Mark. Mark! -What? -There's someone in the kitchen. -Oh, honey, just go back to sleep. You're just having a nightmare. -Mark, please. -What? -Go check. -Stay here. -Now do you believe me? I wasn't dreaming. -I saw something. I heard something. But-- -There's someone in here besides us. -Honey, there are no ghosts here. Maybe it was Anthony. Maybe he was watching TV and then he decided he was tired and went back to sleep, all right? I'm sure there's some logical explanation for this. Just go back to bed. [MUSIC PLAYING] -[MOANING] -[SCREAMING] -Fuck. -Stop! Get off me! Leave me alone! -Who are you? What are you doing on my property? Talk to me, or I'll fucking-- -Hey, come on! -I'll beat it out of you! -I know this son of a bitch! -Stop it, you'll kill him! -I should've killed you when I had the chance. -I know where the rest of the remains are. -Where are they? -I didn't mean for this to happen. -Where are they? What did you monsters do with them? -Let's take him to the tool shed. -What are you gonna do with him? -I don't know. -Don't do anything you might regret. -I've been waiting for this. -What's going on in here? Who's this? Mark, what's going on? -Helen, you were right. Somebody died. Anthony used to live here with his lover, and he was brutally murdered. -Well, what are you planning on doing with him? -He's gonna show us where they hid Adam's body. -The police closed the case because of lack of evidence, but they couldn't find a body, so they couldn't charge anyone. -That's why you're here, isn't it? That's why you insisted on working around the cabin? Anthony, I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what these months have been for you. -We're gonna help you out. Somebody's gonna tell us where the body is. And we're gonna help you give him a proper burial. -I'm sorry. -I'll give you and Adam a moment. Helen and I will be in the car. -So are you guys sure you want to do this? -We're sure. This cabin has been in your family for generations. We want to continue that tradition. Please, stay as long as you like. -And you? -We'll visit every once in a while. -Where are you gonna go? -Back to the city. We have a place there. -I think we've had enough of the country. For now. -This is the house of Adam and Anthony. [MUSIC PLAYING]
