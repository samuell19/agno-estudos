I was born in Denmark, where I have my home there I have roots from there my world goes you Danish spraak you are my mother's voice so sot you blessed my heart when you Danish, fresh beach where ancient giant graves stands between an apple orchard and a hop garden I love you, I love you Denmark my fatherland. Who moves the flower bed in the summer? more rich than here down to the open shore? Where is the full moon over the clover meadow as delicious as in the book's homeland? You Danish, fresh beach ploughshare golden horn fins god give you future as he gave you memories I love you, I love you Denmark my fatherland. It was good you came, parish clerk. Someone sits and waits. Oh, who is that? It should be a surprise. Good day, Dines Mikkelsen. No, it was fun. Good day, Morten Korch. It has been many years since we have seen each other. I was nearby, so I had to stop by. That was kind of you. I look at all the old things you have. Look at this old flint ox. Look how brilliantly it is made. Think of the primitive tools you had back then. Everything you see here was found on my land. They believe that there has been a settlement here a very long time ago. Hear now, what may I offer you? I am well provided for. Yes, but a good cigar? Yes, I can't say no to that. Tobacco, that's my weakness. So you're out here on summer vacation? My wife and I live down at the inn. Are you looking for material for a new novel? I always do that, Dines. Tell me, have you heard of the the Deep-stone? - Yes. It is the large rune stone on the Deep Farm's lands down by the inlet. Well, I'll show you. I've heard of it, but never seen it. It was supposed to be from the Viking Age. Yes, from around the year 900. The runes are well preserved. They tell of a duel that took place. Vermund the Bright was the chieftain's name. He fell, but his men raised the stone in his memory. The place was called the Deep back then, too. - Oh, It sounds interesting. But the boy. Who is it? - Niels Svaerke.The son from the Deep Farm. The picture is old. It is 15-16 years since it was taken. How has the boy been since then? You say something, Morten. How has the boy been? Would you like to hear it? - Yes, please. Deep Farm is a pretty, old farm on 300 acres of land. Fields, forest and meadow. It has been owned by the Svaerkes family for over 150 years. But 15 years ago, not everything was as it should be on the farm. Niels was then a boy of 12 years. You want me to renounce the farm. That's what you want. Yes. I have lost my temper, Hans Svaerke. My attorney here has all the accounts between us. And it doesn't look good. When my father died, you owed him money. A lot of money, even. And you have never tried to pay them back. Yes, I got a reprieve. Your father was an understanding man. Correct, yes. I am also. But only to a certain limit. What about the amounts you owe me? You have won most of them from me in games. Well, yes. And so what? You could leave it alone. Yes, I know I am a weak man. But give me another chance. You will get all the money back. Every cent. Your farm was the best in the whole area once. Now it is, to say the least, neglected. - But you want to get your hands on it. Svaerke! When you lose, you have to pay. Niels. Go on, my boy. This is not for you. Just stay sitting down, my boy. Yes, this is probably the most beautiful place in the whole of Deep Farm. Right, Niels? - Yes, parish clerk. Listen, what is that? Haven't we been friends for many years? Yes, parish clerk. - What is it called then? Yes, Dines. - Yes, that's right. Oh, is something wrong at home? - Yes. I thought so. I've been thinking about you a bit. You are my friends over there on the farm. So have they arrived today? - They are taking the farm from us. So, do they want it? Yes, yes. We'll see. Shall we go for a walk home? - Yes. hey what was that. - You probably walked into a badger den there. Hi, my clog is stuck. What kind of funny ring is that? See. What is it? No, I have it... Do you know what this is, my boy? - No. It is a rune ring that the Vikings wore in a chain around their neck. They believed it could protect them from evil spirits and bring them good luck. Do you see the runes? - Yes. Do you think I can keep it? - Of course. You have found it. It was strange that you found it just today. I believe it will bring happiness. Do you think, Dines? - Yes, yes. I think so. What do you think it is made of? - Of bronze. They made them of bronze or gold. Take good care of it. It is very valuable. What speed Maren has. - I had to go down and help Jacobine. Well, it has happened. She died an hour ago, little miss. Holm. Oh my God. She was a good person. - Yes. Good day, Maren. It was good that you could come. Good day, Jacobine. It was good that you could come. Thank you. It is then one's duty to help one's fellow man. Not least when they are dead. - Oh my God. She was the best nurse we have had here in the area. Yes, but she didn't have it easy. Especially after she had little Grethe. No. Many people were hurt by that. Especially because you didn't know who the father was. But my God, Maren. We humans should not judge each other. I have brought some flowers to put on her chest. What about the child? Jens wants to pick her up and will try to place her at the Deep Farm. At Martha's! She was the worst person to judge her. And she has probably had enough to think about herself. Mother, mother! Dines has come to help us. Yes, if I may, Martha. You can make an attempt. It's no use, Dines. Hans has gambled the farm away over our heads. Well, it's not that bad. It is Karius' fault. Hans had promised never to touch another card. Yes, gaming is a crazy thing. Am I interrupting? - Yes. It was good. That was also what was the intent. Why are you getting involved in this? - Yeah, I'll tell you, that I have a friend. He is sitting outside in the kitchen waiting for a miracle. Jens was a bachelor. He was the original of the place and the rider on Deep, but could not forget that in his youth he had been a cowboy in Texas. Good day! But what on earth is that? It is Miss Holm's little Grethe. She died this morning. Now... Yes, and so what? So what? Someone has to take care of the little kid, right? She can stay here with us, Jens. - No, she can't. But there are probably others in the parish who take care of such a little one. Mother, you can't think she's going out to strangers? Yes, but she can't stay with us. - Then she can stay with me. Can you look after such a crab? - No, but Jakobine can. So she's going to move in with you? - No, I can move down to her place. She has another living room. We could get married. Ah, nonsense. Yes, but the house she lives in belongs to our farm. So, so, Niels. Don't get involved in things you don't understand. She can't be here. Not now. - Oh, she can't do that? Yes, yes, my boy. We get to try if we can find a way out. Then you and Jakobine must take care of her for the time being. And then we'll see. - Yes. We'll see, we'll see. Yes, yes. Until she gets big enough to earn a little for herself. Goodbye little Niels. You're a darn good boy! Goodbye, Jens. Goodbye, little Grethe. Yes, she is sweet, this little one. Mother? Well, they're probably going in there. Thanks to you, Dines. But we'd rather be fashioned... Goodbye, Martha. Goodbye, Dines. Goodbye, Mrs. Svaerke. - Bye. Yes, Martha. So we will stay at Deep. Oh, thank God. It will be as a subcontractor. Dines had to bail for me. - Yes, thank God for Dines. But I had a clause inserted so that I have the right of first sale on the farm. And you will see, Martha! You'll probably have to see, Martha. - Yes, Hans. Parish bailiff! Parish bailiff! What were you yelling? - Dines. Well, it was something else. What did you want, boy? I just want to say thank you. - It was good. Will you promise me to hurry up and grow up so you can really take hold? The Deep Farm must be bought back sometime, right? Yes, Dines. - It is good. Adieu, my boy. Goodbye, Dines! The years passed. Niels kept his word. He got down to business and worked hard. When his father died, he took over the lease on the farm. Niels was a skilled farmer. It was as if everything was thriving for him. He modernized the farm, built new warehouses and improved the stables. Little Grethe had become a capable young girl. Now she worked at Deep Farm. She worked both on the fields and in the house. Good evening, Niels. Good evening, Dines! Anna? Two cellar cold. - Yes. It's time to have a night off, huh? That's enough. I want it turned, by the time it is to be stacked tomorrow. You're welcome. - Thanks. You're welcome. - Thanks. I was at the bank on Thursday to pay the last installment on my debt. So you'll probably hear from them one of these days. You mean "your father's debt?" - Yes, that could be true. Then you should thank me for your help then, Dines. That's nothing to be thankful for, my boy. Tell me, how much have you actually paid off in the eight years, you have leased the farm? - Well, about 40,000. One can almost be proud to know you. Cheers! What the hell! Are you lying there lazying it off, little Jens? Lazying it off? No, that's the worst thing I've ever heard. Now I'm so mad at you that I... ... that I could also drink a beer. Then give it to him. - Goodbye, Dines. And thank you. You're welcome. Here it is. - You are a good person. Thanks for the container. - Bye, bye, Dines. Yes, little Marie. There is someone who loves you, but you don't know it. I don't know? Is it Palle? The cards don't say anything about that. But your life is a chain of vicissitudes, and dark clouds threaten. But in an unexpected way you become happy and get money. You know what, Jacobin? Then I'll get myself a piano. So, will you? Yes, yes. Hmm. But an ugly dream that partially comes true will bring you grief. What did you dream last night, Marie? I sat on the edge of a ditch. ... Ugh, that means grief. ... and saw a goat grassing. A goat? Ugh. Well, we'll have to see. Goat like. ... Let's see here. Goat like the grass. Here it comes. Goat like the grass... Promiscuous acquaintance. Who is it, Marie? What is it? Won't there be a carriage? Ugh, it's Jens who's coming. Off with you. He gets so angry when we sit with the cards. Goodbye, Jacobin. And thanks for the star. No problem. Get out the kitchen door or you'll run into him. Then you're home, Jens. - Yes, you have to get used to that. Aren't you happy for Jakobine then? - Happy? When she married me, she promised to carry me on her hands. Now she is so lazy that she doesn't bother to scratch my back. She has nothing but novels on her mind. "The Pale Countess" and "Forbidden Love." And then she fortune tells in stars. Yes, just laugh. When Grethe was here, I got good food at regular times. But now it's up to you where she makes it. So there is nothing to be happy about. I'm happy for you, Jens. - Why? Yes, because you are a real charmer. Charm troll? Only one could have answered something really biting. Is that you, little Jens? Yes, it's me. Now you will get your food right away. - Yes, it was about time. What is it about? "Burnt wings." It is absolutely glowing. I didn't think the wings were that far down. What are we having for dinner tonight? - Cold pork and potatoes. It certainly isn't... ... like in your young days when you were in the States and caught roasted golden pheasants with a lasso. Yes, that anthem we know. - Yes, you are wonderful. You don't need to be envious because you've only been to Bogense. You thought you didn't get it there, but you did. Who are you running after so fast? - None. Then you'd better join for the last part. Come here. I thought it was Palle. Here comes Niels. - Yes. He will come when he comes. And you don't have to stand and look out for him every night. Palle! Come here and unload. There is something in the cart for you. Oh, is it just you? - Ah, what a slacker you are, Palle. How? - That you can't say that. Said? What? - What you know. What do I know? - That you are crazy about me. Am I, then? - Yes. You are completely out of your mind. Nah, that... Palle. Jakobine read for me today, and an unexpected happiness awaited me. Such a happiness? - Yes. Not with me, you. You had Marie in the back of the carriage. - Yes. I took her down the road. Wondering if things will soon get serious with her and Palle? Not the way she fusses. - Ah. Does she do it? Yes. Sometimes she is completely out of her mind. But Palle is wise enough to know that it is the man that matters. Depends on what? - Ah, Niels. But does Marie fuss too much? It should have been me, then you should see. What was I supposed to see? Nothing. - Did she ask for me? Are you crazy? Where have you been? - At Jacobin. Hurry up and get the cream. - Yes. What on earth are you doing? Nothing. Then we would like to bring in the food. Yes. Grethe has become so thoughtless lately. Is there something wrong with her? - What would it be? I do not know. - She's probably thinking about getting married. You're welcome. - Thanks. When everyone has eaten and you have washed up, you can go to bed. We have a busy day tomorrow. - It is Marie's birthday, after all. And Sophie's. We were supposed to meet tonight down in the meadow. So. Yes, yes. Make sure it's not too late. Good entertainment. - Thanks. Maybe I'll drop by you guys. - Yes, do that. A statement has arrived from the bank today. Imagine that you have already paid all the debt we had on the farm. Yes. And now we have to start thinking about how we can buy it again. If Karius just wants to sell. - Want? We have the right of first purchase. The day we have the money, the farm is ours. It may take a long time, my boy. We just have to keep working. Save and work. Oh God. I wish your father had had your nature, Niels. Father was a weak man. But he was good. By the way, do you know that Clara Karius came home from her trip yesterday? She spends enough money, the little lady. But she can afford it. It might have been wiser for her if she learned how to run the house on a big farm. She's probably not that interested in that. If she once became a wife on a farm like this one? This one here? - Yes. After all, she will inherit it from her father. Before that time, we bought the farm a long time ago, mother. Hey, Niels! Congratulations on your birthday. Thank you. What can we offer you? I think I'll take this one. Yes! Who is knocking? I don't give up at the door. Is it you, you little brats? Jens, won't you come along and add some life to the party. We are a lot of young people from Hovgaarden and Bognaes. Down by the rock. Marie and Sofie have a birthday. Yes, both of them. Both? A twin rarely come alone. I come. I'm going down and playing for the youngsters. - Now? You should bring your lasso, Jens. - Why? Yes, because Kristen down from Hovgaarden doesn't think you can throw with a lasso. Did he say that? - Yes. Then I'll damn well show him something else. Then I take the lasso, hat and the whole suit with me. What the hell is he imagining, that bookfinch? Aren't you coming, Jacobine? - No, I'll stay home and read a bit. Your "Burnt wings' are in the tiled stove. Here he comes! Hello, boys and girls. Naturally. Yippee! So, there you are, you two wagtails. Happy Birthday. Isn't it 36, you are? - No, 18. I meant together, so. Jens, sit down and play for us. Yes, I will. But where is Kristen from Hovgaarden? He sits down on the rock with Karen. He's probably can't say it. Couldn't you talk one at a time? Then I understand you better. Yes, we can do that. - Oh my gosh. It's hopeless. Can you keep this here? - Yes. Okay, okay. It is the best way to catch pigs. Sophie? Can you take it? Niels, shall we not dance? - No, I think I'd rather look at it. Your saggy butt. Lend me that one. - Yes. Come on, Paul! The fiddler grabbed the violin from the wall and went to the green forest and went to the green forest, hello little girls, you will have a dance the old man gave a sweeping dance with Per or Hans As good as it can be, I play for one I play for two, I play for each and everyone Bind your shoes and braid your hair and put on your headgear in the parish, dancing is a source of joy and much joy then the dance went on, it was a slow one out in the green forest out in the green forest, there was a track in the bare earth where the feet got wet and dusk came and the place was empty, there was whispering and laughter among the leaves when morning dawned, two went, but then one was sad... Little Clara. That is way too much. Such a big and nice box of chocolates. I wanted to bring you something. - And it says "Paris" on it. You must be happy to be able to travel like that every year. Happy? Yes. But lonely in the middle of everything. It's so true. It's nice to travel out, but it is even better to come home again. I love this place here. And yet it gives me great joy when I listen that things are getting better and better for Niels. - Still? Yes. I can risk him buying the farm. He has the right to that. It takes a long time. You don't just buy such a large farm. But would it really be necessary? What, little Clara? Mrs Svaerke... Let's talk straight. - Yes. When I was 16, I crushed for Niels. Then I admired him for a couple of years. And now I would like to have him. I have a feeling that his thoughts are going in a completely different direction. Yes, they always have. - How do you mean? Earth, I mean. - Oh, yes... For Niels, there is nothing more precious than the earth here at Deep. Not least, he completely forgets that he is a young man and must live his own life. - Yes. That must one seem to teach him. - I think you should try that. Where is he anyway? - Everyone is down in the meadow tonight. Niels too? - Yes. For once. I think I'll rush down there. - Yes, do that. Goodbye, Mrs. Svaerke. - Goodbye, Clara. Thanks for visiting. - Thanks yourself. A genuine cowboy who rides all day long he rests by the bonfire and sings this song: I have my horse, I have my lasso, yippie I have a sweetheart in El Pasoe, yippie my best friend was indian, yippie he became the last mohican, yippie We have no cowboys here, no gunshots but here life is delicious when the beech comes out I have my horse, it's called Skimmel and it's sunny in Denmark's sky when others praise distant places, I sing of my joys I ride all day and the sun's fire is bad but when it becomes evening, I bring out my banjo Then I sing about beautiful women, yippie about the ones you only find in Texas, yippie my horse it loves the sound of the banjo, yippie it neighs along the song, yippie When happy larks cheer and the sky is so blue then I go into the forest here, it's fun to go maybe you're thinking of a girl, yippie here in nature's green kingdom and there from the inlet, the water flashes yes, it's the most delicious here in the country When I was in Alaska I found a pile of gold then I went to Nebraska and got drunk like a hen and when the sheriff took my shooter, yippie then I screamed: Hands up, you robber, yippie absolutely nothing a cowboy fears, yippie there is something else about a robber. I only know Denmark, but that's enough for me my birth place I love I know every road see the grain gently swaying in the wind and the sun kissing your cheek every summer they bring back the bright nights, bright days. Niels? Good evening, Niels. - Good evening, Clara. Welcome home. Have you had a nice trip? - Yes, thanks. It was a funny song. It's just one that Jens and I sing once in a while. You, look there. - Maren? Come on, Maren. Shouldn't we play "two men for a widow?" Yes! - The children have enough fun. Come on, Niels. Shall we join? - Yes. I run home before she sees me. - Who? Clara Karius. She hasn't given me permission to go tonight. Oh, yes. Go on. Come on, Grethe. Shall we two? - Yes, Kalle. Two husbands rather than a widow. Run! Two husbands rather than a widow. Run. Hello. Catch. Ah, Niels. Yes, Clara? Ah, Niels... Clara! Why are you leaving? It must have been Clara who came home. I would very much like to greet your charming daughter. If it fits. Otherwise I can see her again tomorrow. Thanks. My motorboat is in the harbor, so I will stay for a few days. No, no. I can yell at her. A moment. May I come in, my friend? - You're welcome. Listen hear, Clara? Can't you come down for a moment? No, I do not want to. What's wrong? - Nothing. One of your friends is sitting down there who would like to greet you. One of my friends? Who is it? - It's director Hugo Davis. Davis? Oh, him. I met him last week in town. What does he want? It is true that he has come with a very good offer for the Deep Farm. But of course I said it wasn't interesting. Why? It can't be better then. Really? You do not say? Yes. It would serve Niels right. I must say you amaze me. Niels has the right of first purchase, right? He would do well from being woken up a bit. I thought that Niels was your secret crush. Secret? The gods must know that. No, father. Everyone knows that, and goes and laughs at your daughter who is such a fool to be like that madly, madly in love with that peasant tramp. What do I see in him? I can have so many others, just not him. He has blinders on. I hate him. You have a fierce mind, Clara. You have that after your mother. Yes! But mother didn't get the one she loved either. Yes, but... child! What are you saying? You didn't know that, did you? - I didn't want to say that before. But in an old box in the attic I have found some of my mother's letters. She loved Ole Dines. The parish priest's son. The mate. It is impossible. May I see those letters. - No. I have hidden them. There are other very interesting things in them. Ole refused his mother's love. He loved a certain nurse in the area and wanted to marry her when he returned home from his trip to the tropics. The ship sank, after all, and he drowned. - Yes, he drowned. A few months later, the nurse had a daughter. That means that Grethe from the Deep Farm is his child. Yes, and the parish bailiff's grandson. - The parish clerk has no idea about that. We must inform him. - Why? He has always been your enemy and has opposed you, you say. Yes, for sure... - No, little father. Let's take it easy and see what happens. It is a good card to have on hand. What the hell is a Nicodemus coming sailing there? It is a combine harvester, which I have rented. What then, you said? A combine harvester. It cuts and threshes the grain at the same time. Ties the straw and spits out one end again and collects the grain in a sack and throws out at the other end. Where does the money come from? It's the first time I've been impressed since I was in the States. Niels. Hello, Niels. - Yes. Him Karius, he is sitting away on the farm and wants to talk to you. Oh, Bodil! Come here and take over this here. You say that so strangely. Is there something wrong? He looked so sneaky when he arrived. Watch out. With a fox you must catch a fox. Now, I will. I know how to take her. What is it? It's right here... Oh, damn it. I think she bit. Oh... Good day, Niels Svaerke. Have you come out already? Didn't you get 12 years? - Yes. Thanks for that by the way. That was kind of you. But I have crossed the line. What does 12 years mean in our little democratic society? I managed it with three years. And now I'm enjoying life, as you can see. You are also doing well from what I hear. Although you of course must struggle a little more than me. Tell me, have you stopped just to tell me? Do you know what I'm up to? - No. And that doesn't interest me. Not even when you hear that I want to buy the Deep Farm? It is not true. - See you at home then. There sits Karius. I think he would like to talk to you a bit. There was no one from the agricultural school who could tolerate him. We've had him in our sights for a long time, and we were right. Was he the one who turned you in? - Yes. Six of us were taken. The two died in a concentration camp. It is beautiful. Now he drives around in a dollar grin and plays King Carrot. Ish! All that indulgence. Well, I think Niels is here. - Yes. Good day. - Good day, Niels. Well, I'll find you a cup. - No, thanks. I won't have anything. I'd rather you stay here. Is it true, Karius, that you have a buyer for the Deep Farm? - Yes. I can't deny that. I have received a good offer. - Do you know who you are dealing with? Maybe you do? - Yes. I was involved in arresting him on 5 May. Yes. I have inquired a little about him. He has served his sentence. You can't continue to get hung up on it. And he has the money. But you have the right of first purchase. I have. And I don't have much of a chance to use it. You know that. I'm sorry. But you don't have to be kicked out for that reason. We are willing to let you stay as a lessee. Pre-contract? At his place? No thanks. - You have to make up your own mind about that. I'll go to the bank tomorrow and talk to them about it. Yes, do that. I would be glad if you found a way out. Goodbye, Mrs. Svaerke. Bye Karius. No. No, that shouldn't happen. Ah. What is it, mother? Is that you, my boy? - Are you sick? It's just my heart. It always affects me with mental movements. Shall I collect your drops? No. It's already better. Only you are here. Yes, if I didn't have you. What shall we do, Niels? And just then it really started to lighten up a bit. Then it's a bit difficult to leave everything altogether. It cannot be your intention that we should leave the Deep Farm? Yeah, what else? Have you forgotten what you promised your father? Do you think I have it? - No, Niels. No, my boy. Niels, you must also think a little about me. I am getting old. I'm not that strong anymore. You may not have me that long. You know better than anyone else that my only aim has been to buy the farm back. I have always been willing to make any sacrifice. There is a way out, Niels. You probably don't know how big the sum is. Before you came I spoke to Karius. He suggested that it didn't have to go so wrong. What do you mean, mother? - He mentioned Clara. Clara? Yes, my boy. High from the tree's green top radiates... Jens! - Yes. Get the Jeep ready. The two of us go into the bank. Okay. - Where is Palle? I think he went into the barn. - Yes. ... radiating the Christmas sparkle fiddler, play merrily... Yes, but it's not as difficult to propose as you think. Now I'm going to teach you how to behave. Now you are Marie, and I am you. - Oh? First I take your one hand, and then I take your other hand while I look lovingly in your eyes. Come on. Look me lovingly in the eyes. Yes. - Yes? If you do, you can be sure that Marie wraps her arms around you. Then you just have to give her a kiss, then it's all right. Oh my gosh. - Come on. Let's see how you do it. Yes, then I'm Marie and then. ... No, you're Marie. Yes. Who am I? Well, yes. I am me. I am me... Come on. Give me your one little hand and your other little hand. Look lovingly into my eyes. - Yes, Palle. Yes. Hey. Hey. I did not mean. But I must say that you have abilities. Save your kisses for Marie. - Marie? You know what? She will get me one right away. Ah... You have to... excuse. That you are not ashamed. You cannot be familiar with that. Yes but, yes but... You're a real jerk, aren't you. - But Marie! The bank knows me. They must be able to help me with a loan. Times are tight, Svaerke. I don't think I can give you any hope. The old debt from my father's time is out of the world. The farm is in full operation. You are so persuasive, Svaerke. If only you hadn't been so eager with all that modernization. You have taken on major obligations and debts with all the new machinery. And then the expensive silo that you have acquired. I could not have known that Karius would not renew my contract. And that he suddenly wants to sell the farm now. Then there is nothing wrong with the development. Not if you can afford it. No, you young ones. You think it's that easy. You have no bailiffs. No security you can put. Yes. I have these two! Bye. Oh, so they wouldn't? - No. Can't Dines help us? - No, Jens. He helped your father once. - Yes, he did. But you shouldn't abuse your friends. Dines is old now. He is not going to take any risks. - No. He has actually also become a bit persistent lately. I was down at his place tonight. It was only on a light pilsner. If Davis is meant to live on the farm, then I will go my way. And then we'll have to see to it that we get back to work, Niels. Jakobine and I, of course we follow you. Well, it doesn't want anymore, the shit? - Yes, but you have to leave suddenly, Jens. I? - Yes, I want to talk to Karius. Now. Only that helps. - One can hope so. Hope, it's like an egg. One gets the yolk, the other the white and the third one in the shell. Gooedbye with you. Sophie? Sophie? - Yes. Sofie, say that father is not at home and that I am out in the garden. Yes, but your father is at home. - Do as I say. Good day, Sophie. Is Karius at home? - No, he is not. But the lady sits outside in the garden. - Oh. Thanks. Are you sleeping, Clara? You've cried. Is there anything I can help you with? No, Niels. You can't help me. Everything is so hopeless. You should talk to father. Well, I'm going to pick him up. Your father is not at home. I came to talk to you, but I must come another time when you feel better. - Ah, Niels. I am so unhappy. I had a terrible scene with my father because of that Davis. He is completely smitten with him, but I can't stand him. He showers me with flowers and gifts. He has persuaded my father to let me sail with him in his big motorboat. You don't have to. Not under any circumstances. Davis is a bad guy. I will try to talk to your father. No, you must not! You have no idea how furious dad can get. I begged and asked him not to sell the Deep Farm. Niels. It hurts me so much because of you. Yes, sorry to disturb. - Ah, father. You shouldn't be afraid, Clara. I'll sort this out here. Yes. It was so kind of you, little Clara, that you immediately called me. What do you say? No, no. Not a word. No, he will be allowed to tell me the happy news himself. Yes, I'll see you soon. Yes, I believe. Goodbye. Bye. Grethe? - Yes. She yells at you. - Ah. Oh, are you there, my girl? Come here. I would like to talk to you a bit. Is there something wrong? - No... But there will probably be big changes here on the farm. Sit down. Have you seen this old hymn book? - No. It contains the entire history of the family. Do you see? 1797. - Yes. In it there are both births, weddings and deaths. And the picture there, it's my grandfather. In other words, Niels' great-grandfather. "The town's best man" the old Priest has written on the back of it. Yes, Niels has shown me that. And those words should always apply, he said. Yes. And therefore it must not happen that Niels has to leave the farm either. Right? No. It would be terrible for him. Yeah, right? And that is precisely why I would like to talk to you, little Grethe. Look, my girl. I have seen how it was with you. Although Niels has never said anything. And therefore I think it would be best for all parties that you travel. Travelled? Why? Niels has today become engaged to Clara Karius. No! - Yes, little Grethe. Now I have thought that you could be at my cousin's house in Copenhagen. There you can learn a lot, and also meet other young people. I dont want to. I don't want to leave here! It cannot be otherwise, Grethe. Happiness cannot be forced. And you can't make Niels happy. - You are wrong. Has he ever told you that he likes you? No. Well... There you see. But there is much more at stake than you realise, Grethe. And if you really love Niels, you are the first to help him. Right? - Yes, but... Yes, I understand you, Grethe. But no one can help you better than me. And trust that I will. And Niels didn't notice anything, did he? No. Pardon. Am I interrupting? - No. I don't like to see a girl with tears in her eyes. It doesn't matter. - The sun shines. You are young and pretty. If you don't know it yourself. It probably sounds like nonsense, but I mean it. Really. Pardon. I only stopped to see if the lessee is home. I think he will come soon. Do I get to the breeding buildings there? Yes, you just have to go to the left. ... Then I'll find him enough. And then forget the little heartache, huh? There are many other men. Second? Per, Paul or whatever they are called. Tell me, do you live here on the farm? - Yes. I serve here. Then I look forward to seeing you again. Hey. Hey. What are you stalking? I want to talk to the landlord. Out to the right and into the office. No, hey, hey. Where the hell are you going? What is it with you? I said it's out to the right? What do you imagine? Who are you? What's wrong with you? Well, I'll say... Yes, watch out. When a louse coughs, it cracks. Be careful. You will soon be finished here on the farm. I've noticed you. Be careful not to break the front teeth. You think you're funny? - Yes, yes. I'm not used to being accused in that way. Make sure we don't become unfriended. What the hell does it matter? We already are. If you weren't that old, you got one on the cheek. Hear, what's going on here? - It's that gangster. We probably know what he's after. - So, so, Jens. Tell me, can I do something for you? I wonder if it's not rather I, who can do something for you? Yes. You can do me the favor of disappearing. Don't you think you should stick your pipe in a bit, Svaerke? If you wish to become a lessee with me here on the farm. Make it clear to you right away that you will never enter the farm here. Ha! We'll have to look at that. - Yes, we will! Then the potty is out. Well, so he gave up, he Karius? Yes, Jens. He gave up. Niels? Yes. I just want to congratulate you. - Congratulate me? Yes. Your mother told me. - Oh. Thanks. Thank you, Grethe. Yes, you will probably get. Just take it easy. Jens? Listen, little Jens. Come in a moment. I want to talk to you. Jens. She shouts at you. It's good that you can turn the blind eye around. Why don't you come when I call? I can't be in more than one place at a time. Now you have to be careful, Jens. - Yes, I always am. What was that? You've been so cross lately. Ingratitude is the world's reward. The flag must be raised. And you have to go up and get plates for the dining table. Ah, you gentle. What will happen? Clara and her father come to dinner. What? And her brother and his fiancee. And then Dines, of course. - Well, I have to say that. One would think that a baby baptism or funeral was to be celebrated. No, it shouldn't, little Jens. But the engagement is to be celebrated. You are right about that. Niels? Many memories flood me tonight. Memories from your childhood. Memories from your youth. In particular, I remember a particular day when you gave me your hand. It was small at the time, but big enough to keep what it promised. Do you remember that, Niels? - Yes, Dines. Even back then, you set yourself a goal that you have been striving for ever since. We know your love for the earth. There is also something special about standing and looking out over one's own land, and notice that it grows and grows around one. It is just as if it becomes a part of oneself. You have been a good son to your mother. And we who know your righteousness and your honesty, know you will be a good man to the one, you have chosen to live life with. Shall we drink the bridegroom's cup? - Yes, let's do it. Long live Niels and Clara! - Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Cheers. I was going to say you should put the coffee in the living room. I cannot. - What is it that you can't do? Marie, put the cups on the table. I thought we agreed that you wouldn't spoil anything for Niels. I don't want that either. - Get yourself together. Don't just think about yourself. The coffee must be served immediately. And I don't want to see any sour faces. She is a loving soul. You shouldn't show her that you're so sorry for that. Yes, yes. I'll be right back. It's not just about being newly engaged. No, it's so dark here. By the way, I always thought this kitchen was so scary. I could wish to change that. Oh, that's true. I came out here because I've been spilling on my dress. Grethe, will you bring me some hot water? I will do it. - No, Marie. Go in with the coffee. Is there anything I can help with? - No, mother-in-law. Niels has asked for you. - I'm coming now. It has almost completely gone. - Yes, so. Come now. What are you doing? - I put on water for coffee. There was a virgin who owned property and gold but she was still a childhood friend in her heart but her father said it allows... Is that you, my girl? - Can I sleep here tonight? But little Grethe, then. - I can't stay up there anymore. I understand that very well. Come, my girl. I can't bear to be there. - No. You don't need that either. That's what I'm saying: Happiness is neither bird nor fish. No. And I don't think Niels is worth it. Yes, he is. Niels is good enough. But it is his mother and the others. No. I have to get out of here. - We can talk about that tomorrow. Yes, there is nothing urgent. Let's see the time. Grethe! Where is Grethe? - I do not know. So I've started breakfast. - Do you want to run up and yell at her? It's no use, because she's not there. What kind of nonsense is that? - She must have left. She has not been in bed last night. - What doesn't she have? It was certainly too wrong. Good morning, mother. Is the food done? Good morning, my boy. No, it isn't. Grethe has allowed herself to evaporate. - What does that mean? At least she hasn't been in her bed last night. That's what Marie says. What is this talk about, Marie? - You can look for yourself. Yes. Good morning, Martha. - Good morning. Where is Grethe? - Could it interest you? Why isn't she where she should be? I thought you were most interested in getting her away from the farm. Is she down with you? Answer me. Has something happened? Not much happens here on the farm that I don't see. Our Lord sees everything. But if there is a single little thing that he doesn't see, I see it. Let me off your nonsense. - I have a letter for Niels. Now. I can give him that. No... I better do it. Jens. Do you know why Grethe has left? And you wonder about that? - What do you mean? You can get the answer here in the letter. Now the food is on the table, Niels. Do you come in and eat? Mother, have you asked Grethe to travel? Yes. I have, Niels. It was for your own good that I did it. Say no more, mother. Then the two of us will just be unfriends. How is number 16? - It is good. How much did she give tonight? - Ten kilos. Are you the one who let two heifers loose in the manor field this morning? Yes, and so what? - Then you know they get eardrum sickness. Hello, Jens? By the way, couldn't you give me Grethe's address? Could it interest you? I received a letter from Grethe today. - Oh? She writes that Copenhagen is a much bigger city than she had thought. Well, let's see. What is it, Marie? You must be married in a hurry. Can you really see it in the cards? Yes... Partial. Sofie, what's the matter? - She has dismissed me. Does Clara have? - Yes. She told her father that I listen by the doors. Yes, but don't you, little Sofie? Yes, of course. Otherwise, I never got to know anything. But she can only wait. I have heard something that she knew well she doesn't want me to tell others. And that's what I'm doing now. What is it? Tell me what it is, Sofie. Yes, bring it on. It was an evening when Davis was visiting. Karius had gone up to fetch Clara from her room. And everything is right, because Sofie has found the letter that Clara hid. Oh... Does she have the letter? - Yes. She gave it to me. Here it is. There comes Niels. - Shall we not show him the letter and tell him everything? - No, you should go directly to Dines. I don't think so. - I will join. Oh, Palle. You are so wise. Listen, Palle? - Yes. I thought that you were out harvesting? - I was too. But the tractor stalled. I thought I had to continue with the horses. Excellent. I'll take the horses myself, then you can drive down to the machinist's smith. Yes, it is an outstanding and very valuable discovery you have made. This neck ring is typical of the period around the year 800. Am I allowed to see it? God knows what beauty maiden it graced, eh? It's strange to think about. Yes, but these cases are, according to the Danish law, 'danefe' and must be handed over to us at the National Museum. - Yes, of course. But since it was you who made the discovery, you will be paid the gold value. How much could it amount to? - It's a bit difficult for me aa evaluate carefully. But in 1943/44 a couple of rings like these were found. It was in Sallinglunde on Funen. Their value was 18,000. But here there is a little more, isn't it? - No. And I want to believe that too that you will be paid a bounty of perhaps a dozen thousand. It could be NOK 60-70,000. - Yes, it is possible. Then I can buy the farm. Then I have enough for the payment. We have finished the excavation, and it doesn't look like there will be any more. Well.... Then I will take these things with me. You will hear from me immediately. You're welcome. Thanks. Thank you very much. I must say, Mr. Svaerke, you are a lucky man. Congratulations on the find. - Thanks. I'll follow you out, Inspector. - Thanks. I clearly remember the time when you lost your clog and found the rune ring. Even then you had the gods with you. Yes, one can become purely superstitious. It is remarkable, in any case. What do you want to do now? Explain the whole matter to Karius. I also want to talk to Clara. I have to have clear lines. I like hearing you talk like that. Then you remind me of my son. Ole had the same definite draw in his mouth as you. Good day, parish clerk. We would very much like to speak to the parish clerk. Yes, yes. You're welcome. - Come on, girls. Come on. Good day. - Yes, uh, we came here with Sofie, because Sofie has something very interesting to tell the parish clerk. Oh? But first, Sofie wanted to would like to know about... if it is punishable to listen to the doors. Actually, I don't think it is criminal. Now. Thank God. Sophie... Sofie, show the letter to the parish clerk. And tell him everything you know. - Yes. Thanks. Do you know what the letter says? - Yes. I also heard it from her own mouth. She explained everything to her father. Grethe is my granddaughter. - What do you say? Yes, that's right. Clara, she's known for a long time. She hid the letter and made his father promise that he would not tell anyone. At least to the parish clerk. Sophie, is it true? - Yes. I go up to Karius. - No, let me. I myself have a small account to settle with them. Yes, but Grethe? - Take it easy, Dines. I'll get her back. So there was one more small thing more. Was it if the parish clerk didn't want to marry me and Marie? Because we think she has grown a little too big for a church wedding. It's also so nice here in the parish clerk's living room. With pleasure. You can decide for yourself when it will be. Thank you, Sofie, because you had the courage to write that letter. I won't forget you for that. - Thanks yourself. Bye. Adjoe, parish clerk. Hen's feet and carrots and the neck of a swan the one who kisses the girls he has a horrible habit Come in. Good day, Jens. Good day. I come to ask you: Where is she? Jacobin? - Stop it, Jens. You know very well what I mean. All that Clara stuff, it was all wrong. It's over now. I come from her. Look, that's another piece of nonsense. Forced love does not last long. Where is Grethe? - On the way to Canada. What are you saying? - Yes, she wants to emigrate. Can't I stop her? - Yes, maybe you can. You can try searching here in the pocket. "Coming tonight with 19 15, and cycling straight home. Grethe." What does that mean? That she comes home and says goodbye to Jacobine and me. That's why we're going to have chicken steak. Yes, but Jens, you old fool. Why didn't you say so right away? I'm just a bit odd. We go in and get her. We can make it. - Okay. I'll drop you off here at the station. You take the train south. I myself go to the beach. I will probably put myself in a Swedish port. Oh well. - And then you keep calm, until I telegraph. - There is the train. Here's the folder, and here's the key. - Thanks. Isn't that the little lady from Deep Farm? Yes. - Can I help with anything? No, thanks. Only my bike is punctured. If you're going to Deep Farm, I'm going the same way. Leave the bike and come along. - Yes, please. I'll take the suitcase. - Thanks. We throw it behind. I have my boat lying in the harbor. Do you mind if we go that way? No I have not. I'm just glad you wanted to take me. No, I never have... When one sinks through the earth and comes out in China, if it wasn't our Grethe. - Are you sure about that? Did you see her? Saw her? She was sitting next to him, Davis. - It is impossible. It's not seven o'clock yet. Damn. It has stopped. Come, we follow her. It looks like he's going to the harbor. - Yes, there lies his boat. Where the hell does he get money from? - I have inquired a little about him with an old friend who is employed by the criminal police. They have a good eye on him. He is probably involved in a bigger smuggling story. Don't you want to come down and see what the boat looks like? Yes, thank you, but I'll be sure to slow you down, and they'll be waiting for me at home and... It only takes a moment. - Yes, but I still don't think so... You don't need to be nervous. We will leave again immediately. My sister is on board. You're not afraid of me then, are you? - No. Don't you think it's pretty here? - Yes. Please sit down. - Thanks. Let's hear if there is anything on the radio. where is your sister? My sister? I don't have any sisters. Did you really believe that? Well, we're going to have something to drink. Thanks. I won't have anything. I want to go ashore. You can save yourself that. It is locked. We are sailing. - That was also the intention. No! Hello. No, it won't work. Let me out! It doesn't work. So, so. It will certainly amuse my old friend Niels Svaerke to hear about our little excursion. Oh! Are you hitting me? There it sails. May the evil one shake and devour me. What shall we do? I know a Fajersen, and he has a motorboat which is here in the harbour. We'll take it. There it is. It's the one with the tent on it. He had to go outside the Trellegrunnen, but we crossed over. It's then to hell with the engine. You can go completely wild when you first get started. Here it goes! I don't think we will reach them. He who laughs last, comes on. Niels! Niels! Come on, Grethe. Turn the boat! Into land with it. Anthony! Knock him down. You hit me, you idiot! Come and help me. Come on, Jens! I'm there now! Let's get away in a hurry. Come on, Grethe. Two thrushes sat on a beech branch, two good friends they were Tralulalu, tralulalej... You see, Morten. It was a big moment for me. When she came home in my living room. - Yes, you can see there. Life can also be more romantic than my books. Yes. Come here, Morten. - What is it now? Do you see the two coming driving there? --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
