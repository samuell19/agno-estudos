It is a real strong blockade against Cuba. We Cubans have to fight a lot to survive. They hinder us in every way. It affects me 'cause a lot of people are suffering. I think it's something... ...unspeakable. Very bad. A lot of years. A lot of abuse. BLOCKADE BLOCKADE the war against Cuba The blockade tears, wounds... ...every activity... ...in Cubans' lives... ...and won't quit striking for a minute. The blockade is one of the US war measures... ...against Cuba. Just one. One of the measures that was established the fastest... ...over a period of several years. I think that the starting point has to be... ...the aggressive policy the US developed against Cuba... ...since the very moment the Cuban Revolution succeeded... ...on January 1 st, 1959. The Batista regime falls. The night of December 31 st., though some had left before... ...the leaders of that regime leave... ...carrying money with them. The New York Times published an editorial.... ...where they admit that those who ran away from Cuba... ...when the Batista regime fell... ...took with them... ...physically... ...the Cuban national treasury's securities. Have you seen a cent of that money? The US government neither extradited those thieves... ...nor gave back a penny of that money. So, without doubt... ...the first and one of the most serious blows... ...to the Cuban economy, came from the US government. I would say that... ...even before... ...the revolutionary power was established in Cuba. 23: Guant?namo Sugar Company. 24: United Fruit Company. The blockade was a plan of the Eisenhower administration... ...designed to overthrow Fidel Castro in six weeks. Definitively, it failed. We have implemented the appropriate measures... ...to resist and, listen carefully... ...to repel any direct aggression from the United States. If they establish a blockade... ...they'll just make us grow in stature... ...because our nation can resist. We will resist any total blockade. Over that same period, the first blockade measures... ...started arising. They began by cutting off the oil supply. The US government started rejecting credit... Then, they forbade American refineries... ...to refine oil that wasn't American. They started reducing the sugar quota. Then they cut out the sale of spare parts... ...to Cuban companies. And it was an industrial system, in the late '50s, early '60s... ...where technology in Cuba had an American origin. So there was a combination in time... ...between the acts of sabotage and the attacks... ...and the beginning of the restrictive measures against us. Over 70% of the Cuban trade... ...depended on its trade with the US. Cuba sold the US more than 60% of its sugar. So, within the war logic... ...it was a rationally thought measure... ...intentionally aimed at overthrowing a government. An official from the State Department, in an internal memo... ...describes what they are up to. This is a memo that wasn't made public at that time... ...in 1960. It was made public in the eighties, the nineties... ...when it was declassified. In that memo, this official analyzes... ...what would those... And we're not talking about Torricelli or Helms-Burton. We're talking about the first steps. It was a year before the Playa Gir?n invasion. It was a year before Fidel announced the Revolution. It said: "A vast majority of Cubans support Castro". The president was the addressee of this document. "There is no real political opposition." It admitted that the Cuban Revolution had, as it has today... ...a huge popular support. Otherwise, it would had fallen. "The only foreseeable way to alienate the internal support... ...is through disillusionment and discouragement..." We have to create discouragement, disillusionment. "...based on dissatisfaction and economic problems. We must promptly implement", the undersecretry said... "...any conceivable means... ...to weaken Cuba's economic life. Deny Cuba money and supplies... ...in order to decrease real and monetary wages... ...so as to generate hunger, despair... ...and the ovethrow of the government. From the beginning, the policy's essence was... ...to strike the people, to hurt the people... ...make them suffer... ...as a means of... ...fighting against a revolutionary government. We have to put pressure on them, steam the boiler... ...until it blows out. THE COMMERCIAL RESTRICTIONS The blockade prevents us from exporting to the US. Cuba can't sell anything in the US. Cuba could sell in the US... ...50,000 tons of nickel a year. We could sell lobster and sea products. Biotechnological and medicinal products. We could sell tobacco. In New York, a smuggled Cuban cigar... ...costs fifty dollars. Just one cigar. We could sell rum, we could sell software. We could sell vaccines, biotechnological products... ...but Cuba can't export anything. Actually, Cuba can trade with the whole world. The problem is that the whole world can't trade with Cuba. For instance, we buy an Argentine product... ...and the letter of exchange or whatever its name is... ...can't be in US dollars... ...'cause when it gets to the bank it is confiscated... ...by the US government. It has to be other currency. Last year, an important Swiss bank... ...the UBS Bank, the Union Bank of Switzerland... ...was given a fine of 100 million dollars... ...for accepting a transference in dollars from Cuba. Those kind of things make it risky. And Cuba has to be very disciplined... ...when it comes to establishing its trade. Constantly, we have to exchange our dollars... ...for other currencies. We lose 50, 60 million dollars a year... ...to exchange, to exchange rates. A company... ...cannot sell Cuba... ...a product, an equipment... ...if that product of a Canadian, French, German... ...Japanese, Argentine company, has more than a 10% ... ...of American components. Cuba can't buy a Boeing 'cause it's an American plane. But we can't buy an Airbus either, eventhough it's European... ...because it has American avionics. The mission of every American embassy is... ...to write to the companies of those countries... ...that trade with Cuba... ...and warn them about the sanctions they are liable to... ...and threaten them, telling them... ...that in case of a Cuba without socialism and without Fidel... ...they won't have their share. Mercedez Benz, the German company... ...or Mitsubishi, the Japanese one, have to prove... ...to the US government, that the car they try to export... ...to the US... ...has no Cuban nickel among the metals it was built of. US inspectors go to the factories, review the contracts... ...investigate where you bought the stainless steel... ...you used in this car. An Australian company? They go to Australia... ...and check if the Australian company uses Cuban nickel. And when they tell you that you'II be sentenced... ...that you won't be able to sell in the US... ...that your executives and their children... ...won't be able to enter the US, obviously... ...a CEO has to think twice before making a decision. So, the blockade is an economic war. It can't be seen as a bilateral issue between Cuba and the US... ...serious enough as it would be. The blockade is established... ...in an extraterritorial way. That's why Cuba is out of the IMF, the World Bank. Orders were given to the staff members of these institutions... ...that govern themselves by the countries' participation rate... ...being the US's the highest, forbidding them to aprove... ...funds or plans for Cuba. Last year, the Interamerican Development Bank... ...Ioaned in Latin America, in concessionary conditions... ...9 billion dollars. But they can't loan a single dollar to Cuba. It is absolutely forbidden. It can't be questioned. And, in fact, it isn't questioned. If Cuba had received just 1% of that money... ...it would had meant 90 millions. We could do a lot with... ...that kind of money: Repair hospitals, build roads... ...improve the access to potable water. So Cuba can only resort to other instances... ...that mean more expensive loans. Per?n! Per?n! Per?n! Per?n! The blockade was broken off for the first time... ...by Per?n's Argentina. During the C?mpora administration... ...important contracts are signed, and bilateral relations... ...between Argentina and Cuba are promoted. President Per?n gave Cuba loans, to buy in Argentina... ...in 1973. Cuba tried to purchase in Argentina... ...from American subsidiaries... ...such as Ford, Chevrolet, General Motors and so on... It was impossible. Nobody could sell Cuba anything... ...much less American subsidiaries. Per?n said that he would nationalize them... ...if they didn't sell to Cuba. The US was forced to make that exception. And for the first time, and only one, after the Revolution... ...we received cars make Ford, make Chevrolet... ...Frigidaire cooling units... ...equipment manufactured by Argentine workers... ...with Argentine raw material, in Argentina. That worked out until the Torricelli Law. Mr. Torricelli put an end... ...to that trading with the subsidiaries... ...Iocated abroad. Those countries in which those subsidiaries are settled... ...that accept that those subsidiaries rule themselves... ...by American legislation... ...extraterritorially applied... ...what are they really doing? They are giving up sovereingty. The Torricelli Law was one aspect. The other one was... ...that they banned the ships involved in the trade with Cuba... ...they banned those ships from entering American harbors. What is the effect on Cuba? Shipping companies won't send their ships to Cuba. Recently, a container with Cuban juice was shipped... ...to Japan... ...in a vessel, and was totally confiscated... ...because the vessel docked at a harbor... ...where it could be confiscated. We are now looking for ships so that we can bring... ...to Cuba cattle on the hoof from Canada. And the ships in the region refuse to do it. The Helms-Burton Law, as opposed to the Torricelli Law... ...is a law that was wholly conceived... ...in connection with the economic war against Cuba... ...and the overall war against Cuba. It is not a defense spending law to which they added... ...a section about Cuba. This law, from start to finish... ...is in connection with Cuba. It tries to impose the American law... ...on other countries' laws, on the international law. That's why every year, since 1992... ...we submit a resolution to the UN... ...called "The Need To End The Trade, Finnancial And Economic... ...BIockade lmposed On Cuba By The US." It's a clear and precise vote. A vote against the blockade. In 1992, for the first time, that resolution... ...got 59 votes in favor. During the last fourteen years... ...the number of votes has been systematically and continuously... ...increasing. Last year, 179 countries out of a total of 191 UN members... ...passed the resolution. Excellencies, on behalf of a little country beset... ...for wanting to be free, I respectfully ask you to... ...once again, vote in favor for the resolution... ...submitted by Cuba. Thank you very much. We will start the voting. The assembly is voting resolution number 959... ...L2 "The Need To End The Trade, Finnancial And Economic... ...BIockade lmposed On Cuba By The US". Those who are in favor of the aforementioned resolution... ...show it with your vote. As well as those who are against it... Please check that your vote is registered on the screen. The voting has been completed. The machine is locked. "La Corona" Tobacco Factory The resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly... ...are recommendations. They don't have a mandatory nature. And the UN don't have the means to enforce... ...those resolutions. And there is also a political element... ...which is, saying it in plain Spanish... ...that the US give a damn about the United Nations. It is a sign of imperial arrogance... ...ignorance of an international clamor... ...ignorance of the international law. The US only wants one United Nations 100% subdued... ...to the US interests. The more... ...Americans and the international community reject the blockade... ...the harder... The Bush administration... ...has clamped down on the blockade like never before. I think the blockade is very unfair. We can't receive medicines, medical equipment... We can't trade with other countries, develop ourselves. They shut us down. We suffer it with the electricity problem. They cut it for hours. Sure, they give priority to food. But what about the rest? It also affects us, a pair of shoes, clothes, whatever. Do you think I like the transportation? It shouldn't be in this condition. But we... ...can't buy a single part. As long as the blockade exists, there will be need, poverty. It affects trade and it affects our families. Things like medicines, that we need... ...and have to buy through a third country. Our social system is ready to pay whatever it costs... ...in order to cure for free and they won't sell us. Obviously, it affects us. Those who feel Cuban will tell you. That's the greatest crime regarding all this... Regarding this blockade... ...that has been carried out against Cuba for so many years. And it is choking the baby in its cradle. Like William Blake, the English poet, said. It is better to choke a baby in its cradle... ...than kill a desire, suppress a desire. You can read it the way round. To suppress a desire, in this case a desire for justice... ...a desire for freedom, for community, for equality... ...is to kill a baby in its cradle. MORE RESTRICTIONS The blockade prevents us from receiving American tourists. The blockade... ...in real terms, is violating the US Constitution. Because Americans can't travel to Cuba. The American who comes to Cuba can be sentenced... ...to 10 years in jail and given a fine of 250,000 dollars. With 500 millions, we could build 100,000 dwellings... ...a year. One of our biggest problems is the housing problem. During the last 15 years we couldn't build... ...the homes we needed. We have to build 100,000 homes a year... ...over a period of 10 years... ...20,000 of them in the city, so as to face the problem. It would cost us 500 millions, but we don't have the money. However, 5 million American tourists... ...would mean 12 billion dollars gross... ...and a profit of, at least, 4 or 5 billions. 10 times what we need to build 100,000 homes in one year. Part of the tourism that came from the US were Cubans... ...who lived there. But now a family won't risk... ...getting a fine or a sentence... ...for violating what the US government established. Before... ...due to Clinton's kindness, you could visit your family... ...once a year. With Bush, once every three years... ...provided they give them permission. So, now your right has been reduced... ...to asking permission once every three years... ...to visit, not any relative of yours... ...but the family as was redefined by Bush. It is an attack on the Cuban family... ...by a government that calls itself a defender... ...of the Cuban family. - So, the blockade... ...is the main obstacle to Cubans' well-being. The blockade... ...affects medicine in many ways. For instance, when it comes to certain medicines... ...produced only in the US... ...we must buy them to third countries and pay a lot more... ...for them. In the case of... ...infectious diseases, when a new antibiotic is launched... ...or a product to combat a vector... ...we cannot get it. I know cases where people were really desperate... ...because they couldn't get medicines to save... ...their loved ones. I've seen a lot of rage... ...desperation, a lot of suffering in the people. A patient needs a medicine we have to buy abroad... ...but we can't buy it because it is an American product. That patient is affected. For instance, you want to buy some equipment in Japan. If it has American components, you can't buy it. We bought medical equipment from a Canadian company... ...that was purchased by an American company. And now they won't sell us parts to avoid being fined... ...by the US government. They tried to deprive us... ...of the influence of the universal culture schools. The blockade systematically forbids... ...due to different regulations throughout time... ...the exchange of American students... ...and Cuban students. And it forbids the exchange of professors from... ...the USA and Cuban professors. It harms the Americans, 'cause Cuba has interesting outcomes... ...and each day is harder for them to come to conferences. For instance, the achievements in our... ...biotechnological or genetic engineering... ...research centers. The latest achievements. They even tried... ...to prevent Cuban papers from being published... ...in American magazines. They tried. But the American publishing companies rebelled... ...against that measure and they had to overturn it. You are absolutely banned... ...from entering the US... ...because you are considered... I am like an image... ...because I represent danger to... ...to... How was it? To... To the US. It can't be possible. Because I just sing. My weapon, my weapon is singing. My mouth. I don't... My hands are clean. Automatically clean. I have nothing to do with guns. Now, if you think... ...that I can kill with my voice, then it's okay. But I think the opposite. TRUTHS AND LIES We don't want the press to defend us. We want the press to tell the truth... ...so that people can draw their own conclusions. The weight of the media manipulation is huge. When an Argentine goes to the US... ...they say "he emigrates". Or a Mexican emigrates. When a Cuban goes to the US they say "he runs away". When they all have the same reasons to go. You arrive in Cuba somehow fearfully... ...because you hear so many things... ...that definitely are not true. Bush invested 59 millions in that. They manage to get important papers, international press... ...to publish articles against Cuba. They give money to... ...Reporters Without Frontiers. In fact, those 59 millions they gave... ...those groups this year, is a lot more... ...than the money we have to implement projects... ...that benefit millions of Cubans. Paid articles in important papers, TV shows... ...events against Cuba like the one held in the Czech Republic. Sometimes, when we go back to our countries... ...we find ourselves more open-minded. And when you talk about Cuba, many people say... "Hey, they changed you way of thinking. What are they telling you about Cuba?" But they should have to be here to see what's going on. We need objective information... ...and range regarding this issue. The American press... ...avoids telling this reality. And in spite of the injustice and, as my mate said... ...in spite of the blockade against Cuba... ...it is remarkable to see how this people got through it. It is a very interesting thing and everyone who arrives here... ...realizes what the reality is in no time. I've met with American senators, congresspersons... ...that came to Cuba... People that supported their policy but accepted to come. And many times, almost always... ...we talked more or less in these terms. I ask them: "Why the blockade? Why are you trying to starve us to death? Why don't you recognize our rights?" They say: "We blockade you 'cause you are not democratic". First of all, that's nonsense. It is a lie. It isn't a serious argument. Everybody knows... ...that the US has had and has excellent relations... ...with countries that have governments... ...that they don't describe as democratic themselves. "What is it that you don't like of the Cuban model?" "The fact that you have only one party. And we think that democracy means more than one party." There is a long list of countries... ...whose systems are not a bit alike the Occidental system... ...they impose as the paradigm. "How many parties are there in China? One, like in Cuba. And you maintain relations, trade with them." "But China is a big market." The list is very long. And the US... ...has excellent relations with those countries. "Take Saudi Arabia. You criticize Cuba... ...and in Saudi Arabia there are no parties. And in Saudi Arabia women are not allowed to drive in public." "Well, but they have oil", they tell me. And, above all, economic relations. A country's foreign policy can't be based only on interests. It has to be based on principles. "That's the difference between you and us. You need ethics." They've never asked about a country's organization... ...when they appropriate this country's mines, oil... ...or whatever they want. "You can't say that you want democracy in Cuba... ...because, among other things, you aren't a democratic model." A country in which you need 9 millions to be elected senator... ...and over 100 millions to be president is not a democracy. The American system is for fools. It is a corrupt system, does not represent the will of the people. Many think the president stole the election twice. We don't accept their model. We demand the right to have... ...our model, our way to govern our country. Here I had a cute experience that taught me a lesson. I have a Cuban daughter and more than 5 years living here... ...so I had the chance to vote. You go to... ...the polling station and you find the candidates' biography. Just a page where you can read what he has done. You went there and voted, discussed why to vote... ...for one and not for the other. But you don't see them walking along the street... ...or offering things. No, not at all. Our delegate works hard for the neighborhood... ...but he doesn't quit his job. After work... ...he sees you in some place where you can talk... ...or he goes to your home. He tries to keep everything organized. If you were an American journalist, you'd had already... ...asked the question. Because they repeat it a lot. "Many people think you are happy with the blockade. That you don't want it to be lifted." They say: "Cuban excuse. Cuba has problems due to a bad administration." I tell them: "If it is an excuse, leave us without it. Lift the blockade, and prove us wrong." "Let's do something. Lift it just for a while. A year without the blockade. And we'II see who wins." COUNTERREVOLUTION An unusual thing regarding American policy towards Cuba... ...is that the US policy towards Cuba, for many years... ...wasn't based on the US national interests. If the US formulated a policy towards Cuba... ...well, undoubtedly... ...they would encourage trade, relations with Cuba. One of the main features of the American administrations... ...is their pragmatism. And they follow this philosophy of... ..."if you can't beat them, make friends with them". In the Cuban case, they've done it all the way around. They weren't able to beat us but... ...they can't be our friends. We offered the US government to cooperate in the fight... ...against drugs, or terrorism. Or to prevent illegal migration. And they turned us down... ...eventhough this is good for them... ...because they fear the reaction of the radical groups in Miami. That reactionary emigration... ...that lives on the business of the policy against Cuba... ...has been the big loser for 45, 46 years. They've always lost. Though they have... ...hundreds of millions of dollars, they've always lost. It happens that the policy towards Cuba was kidnapped... ...by these Cuban terrorist groups... ...radical groups organized in the US. They are no more than 20, 30 Cuban families... ...but they are those who have the money. They don't represent most Cubans' interests... ...who have emigrated due to economic reasons. They are the former batistianos, the former owners... ...the former exploiters and torturers that have... ...great influence there. We must remember that the US president's brother... ...is the governor of Florida. And among other things... ...his strength lies in a very close relation... ...with the most reactionary sector... ...of the Cuban emigration. They fund campaigns, for instance... ...out of 40 republican representatives... ...elected last November... ...26 have received money from the ultraconservative... ...Cuban lobbies in Miami. Paying debts... ...the government contracted with that... ...so reactionary sector of the Cuban emigration... ...that lives on the counterrevolution business. These are those behind the drafting... ...of Bush's plan for Cuba. That is... ...according to what its preface states... ...like a body of measures to take... ...seeking protection in the Helms-Burton law... ...to achieve that law's goals. Its goals are to subvert Cuba... ...destroy the revolution and then annex Cuba. The law clearly states... ...that its goal is to put an end to the Cuban Revolution. Bush said: "We're not waiting for Fidel to go. We're working to overthrow him." After the revolution there would be a "transitional period". And then, what they call a "democratic stage". And it defines, in writing, it is stated in the law... ...requirements... ...analyzing which the US government must evaluate... ...if the Castro regime has ended, if there is a transition... ...or a democracy. The first one, the most important one, is... ...the one related to the properties... ...that were nationalized in Cuba... ...at the beginning of the Revolution. After defeating the Revolution, the US will appoint in Cuba... ...a governor, for Cuba... ...and turn Cuba into a US province. Dismantle the whole country. Take cooperatives away from the peasants. Take farms away from over 100,000 peasants... ...that were given lands because of the agrarian reform. Bush said: "Our policy towards Cuba is the regime change". Free education, health, would disappear. It is stated in Bush's plan. This violates de UN charter, violates the international law. A government doesn't have the right to change... ...other country's authorities. THE TERROR The strategy... ...of the successive US governments against Cuba... ...has not excluded... ...any kind of aggression. The truth is that... ...successive American administrations... ...have encouraged terrorism against Cuba. Acts of sabotage, burning of sugar-cane plantations... ...sabotage against economic facilities... ...as a vehicle that the US government, at that time... ...it was still the Dwight Eisenhower administration... ...used to try to destabilize... ...the infant Cuban revolutionary process. We had to resist military attacks. ATTACK ON PLAYA GIR?N (Bah?a de Cochinos) MASS INVADERS SURRENDER Cuba is within minutes... ...of the American Air Force action... ...their rockets, their military units. From the US, gunboats arrived... ...that fired at civilian towns in Cuba. We had to endure the dirty war. The organization by the CIA... ...of armed gangs that operated in Cuba... ...between 1969 and 1967, when they were defeated. Thousands of armed men... ...who killed peasants... ...and young people who were teaching to read and write... ...in the mountains and rural areas. Students, almost children. At that moment the biggest CIA station ever was created. It was based in Miami. There, thousands of Cuban were trained... ...in sabotage and demolition techniques. There was an attempt to kill Che with a bazooka... ...when he took part at the UN General Assembly... ...on December, 1964. Another aspect, near in time... ...is the support, the funding... ...the supply and encouragment given, from the US territory... ...to terrorist groups... ...in the US or abroad, so that they act against Cuba. Murderous hands place bombs at the nationalized El Encanto... ... where thousands of Cuban families earn their living. In downtown Havana... ... jeopardizing numerous Cuban homes... ... they cause a massive fire. They don't care about the lives of children, women, old people. With these barbaric deeds, the Yankee imperialism... ... hopes to destroy our national riches... ... stop production and promote shortage. The blowing-up of the ship LaCoubre where more... ...than 100 people died, including French and Belgian sailors. SABOTAGE ON THE LACOUBRE Havana, 1960 Cuba, for sovereignty. The US, for intervention. Cuba, for culture. The US, for ignorance. Cuba, for the murdered teachers. The US, for the murderers. There are crimes that were committed... ...beyond our national frontiers. Many, in the US. My brother Eulalio emigrated to the US... ...around 1961, 1962, like many Cubans. We was a member of the Committee of the 75... ...a group of 75 Cubans, one of the first to visit... ...our country, to promote a rapprochement... ...and family reunion... ...and a fight for support in the US against the blockade. First he was threatened and finally murdered... ...on November 25, 1979... ...by Omega 7. They designed more than 600 plans to kill Fidel. There were biological wars, biological aggressions... ...epidemics introduced that affected plants and animals. The dengue fever epidemic introduced as a lab virus. In less than three years... ...five serious plagues and epidemics ravaged our catlle... ...our plantations and, what is even worse... ...our population. Hog cholera... ...blue mold of tobacco... ...sugarcane plant rot... ...dengue hemorrhagic fever... ...and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis... ...have caused important material and human damage. In 1981... ...is introduced in Cuba, in an artificial way... ...the dengue 2. This dengue 2... ...shows up, at the same time... ...in 3 different spots, 300 Km. Distant from each other. And an epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic is unleashed... ...out of context, given the fact that in America's history... ...only 60 cases of the disease had been reported... ...and in the Cuban epidemic 10,000 cases were reported. Out of 158 dead, 101 were children. The economic cost ran to 103 million dollars in 4 months. But we got the epidemic under control. In the nineties starts... ...a plot designed to... ...destroy the, at that time, increasing tourism in Cuba. How? Blowing up hotels. When I notice that there was nobody left... ...I stood up... ...and went to... ...to place the explosive. I acted like I was asking something... ...in case somebody was watching. And I waited to see if the bartender came. He wasn't here and I had already opened the bag... ...with the explosive, so I just looked everywhere... ...and surreptitiously took the explosive and slipped it here. I slipped it here and turned it like this. It is not only to put an end to the Cuban Revolution... ...by causing desperation and famine to the Cuban people... ...but also by killing innocent people. Thousands of Cuban families have lost a relative. More than 3,000 Cubans have died in terrorist attacks... ...over these years. It is called international terrorism. It existed and it exists. It sprang from the sponsorship... ...of certain American sectors... ...in which the Bush family occupies a privileged position. In September, 1998... ...five companions are arrested. Their main mission in life was, precisely... ...to send to Cuba that information, those data... ...that would had helped... ...frustrate those terrorist acts. The American government knows that they exist... ...because Cuba has handed detailed information... ...regarding names, places, what do they organize. However, they've never done anything to protect us. They ignore it. The United States lies... ...when they talk about a supposed fight... ...against terrorism. The US government broadcasts... ...radio stations and TV channels of the US... ...from Air Force planes... ...trying to wipe out Cuban stations... ...violating our radio space. The so-called Mart? Radio and the Mart? TV. Those abominations. You try to listen to the Cuban radio station... ...and you listen to a US broadcast where they give you... ...practical tips about how to burn down your factory... ...without being caught. Where they encourage violence, where they encourage murder. Where they tell people, continuously... "The Cuban problem will be solved by killing Fidel". See? Media terrorism. SPECIAL PERIOD If the Cuban people deserves credit for anything at all... ...it is for its feat of the last 15 years. Because during the first 30 years of the Revolution... ...we had the blockade but also relations with the USSR... ...the socialist countries. They bought our products... They sold us what the US denied us. They gave us credit... ...let us gain access to technologies, maybe outdated... ...fuel consuming, but it was the only resource we had... ...and thus we could develop our country. But it is interesting that, in 1990... ...when the USSR disappears... ...when the socialist field disappears... ...in which we could trade and protect ourselves... ...and we were left alone, overnight... ...Iosing the partners with which we had 85% of our trade... ...at that moment we proved that this was a real revolution... ...with popular support. And in a matter of hours... ...this country fell into a very difficult situation... ...that we call "special period". Between 1989 and 1993... ...in four years, Cuba's GDP dropped 35% . In Argentina, during the years of the crisis, it just dropped 22% . The real effect was a second blockade. All of a sudden, the markets fall... ...we lose all supplies provided by that part of the world. Cuban imports dropped from 8,5 billions in 1989... ...to 1,5 billions. Agriculture was brought to a halt, due to lack of fuel... ...fertilizers, spare parts for the farm machinery. The industry was paralized. We had to look for new markets... ...where to sell our sugar, our citrus products. All that under the blockade, hardened by the minute. Then the Torricelli law came... ...to deliver the coup de gr?ce. The Cubans' daily caloric ingestion... ...dropped from 3,000 calories a day to 1,900. According to the WHO... ...it can't be less than 2,400 kilocalories a day. You can imagine the restriction. However, during those years... ...when we were starving, when we didn't have 500... ...of the 800 hundred medicines used in Cuba... We had no raw materials to produce them... ...transportation was paralized. There were no cars on the streets. One million bikes... ...a day, riding along the city. 20 hours a day without electricity. We were left, as we put it, hanging on to the brush. They took the stairs away. And we didn't fall. Because of the social model... ...that in such a situation, didn't go like... "Every man for himself... ...let the strongest or the richest survive". We said: "We have little food so let's give priority... ...to pregnant women, to newborn children... ...to old people who live alone". We didn't say: "Let's privatize the services and those... ...who have money will pay for them, and those who haven't... ...will have to realize they have no rights". We had to get back on our feet... ...to better ourselves, to be able to... ...be more creative, to try harder. We said: "We won't close our schools... ...eventhough we don't have books, eventhough we have... ...to sew those books from year to year". Families lent each other their children's uniforms. We shared the little we had, solidarity between neighbors. The State didn't abandon anybody to his fate. And today, anybody that looks objectively... ...at the Cuban situation... ...must realize that today, the situation... ...beyond the difficulties that you must have seen... ...is better than the situation we were in... ...when what we call the special period started. We developed tourism, accepted foreign investments... ...we developed new areas in our production... ...we started producing our own fuel. And step by step we managed to get through it. RESURGENCE After the socialist field fell, Cuba had to change radically. It had to make deep changes in its economy... ...to steer its economy in a different way. It had to think in other productive sectors too. The situation has evolved thanks to wisdom, effort... ...thanks to a very consistent policy. Above all, thanks to our people's effort. Today, our country has a lot of strength, doubtlessly... ...in certain sectors that didn't exist 15 years ago. Cuban public health, in spite of the economic problems... ...in spite of the blockade, achieved relevant, competitive... ...outcomes regarding first world countries. Cuba had to make an extraordinary effort... ...so as to, for instance, increase life expectancy. A Cuban's life expectancy already exceeds 75 years. This year, the tuberculosis rate was 6.8. 6.8 per 100,000. And now we are set out to eliminate TB in Cuba... ...when in developed countries it is increasing. An infant mortality rate of 5.4 every 1000 born alive. It is one of the lowest in the world. Today, when you analize Cuban health indicators... ...all of them are way above the region's ones... ...and on a par with developed countries. We have a biotechnological and pharmaceutical sector... ...that transfers and sells technology even to American... ...companies. An American company, CancerVax... ...based on Texas... ...was allowed by the Department of the Treasury to buy... ...Cuban technology to develop a vaccine against cancer. Cuba is the only country that underwent such a crisis... ...without harming its social indicators. The same happened regarding education. We had to make a tremendous effort to develop... ...a real universal and free education system. The artistic teaching system in Cuba... ...is an example to Latin America. Around the world, few institutions... ...related to artistic teaching... ...have in just one building... ...as the Instituto Superior de Arte has... ...every artistic expression. We must remember that over 40,000 young people... ...from 120 countries, graduated from Cuban universities. 30,000 of them, Africans. Now we have in Cuba over 16,000 students on grants. There are 25 students per classroom, max. Every student is guaranteed his microscope. Those personal classes are not only for foreigners. Cuban students are treated the same, in spite of the blockade... ...and that's remarkable. We offered them to study here. Their families are poor. They belong to 80 different Latin American ethnic groups. Out of 16,000 young people... ...more than 10,000 study Medicine. 1,500 will graduate in Medicine, in our country this year. We have Cuban doctors working in 68 countries... ...without cost for those countries. It is an indication of the strength of the ideas... ...and it is an indication of the social vocation... ...of the humanist vocation the Cuban Revolution has. We have a very efficient, a system of solidarity... ...united to the Cuban Revolution's development. That's the main thing, that's the sin they won't forgive. They blockade us 'cause they can't accept... ...that a little country, once their fief, has become free. Has challenged them. They blockade Cuba because Cuba is a symbol of light. Cuba is the idea that you can be a different, free country. - A country with solidarity. - Only those who... ...live this process from within... ...can assess the real magnitude... ...of the amount of energy... ...that was needed so that all this could be developed. But we've given the people... ...a sense of dignity. A national pride, with our own culture and language... ...our own institutions, having written our own Constitution. This country was an American colony... ...where American soldiers took pictures of them urinating... ...on the statue of Cuba's national hero. Where the president was appointed... ...by the US ambassador. Where the American transnational companies ruled... ...our country's economy. We have flaws like any human being. But we have that feature that nobody else could develop... ...and it is nothing to be proud of. Other peoples never had the opportunity... ...to have to endure a blockade during 45 years... ...the fall of a friend and then 10 years of special period. You have to create, to have to grow a lot... ...in order to survive. When Fidel goes and explains, people know he's not lying. They know he has no secret account in a foreign bank. They know we don't steal the state's money... ...or sell influence in order to obtain material benefits. In Cuba, people know that when we have a power cut... ...power is cut off in the ministers' homes too. And they know our kids don't go to special schools. They know our kids go to school... ...with the rest of the kids in the neighborhood. And they know that... ...without egalitarianism that wouldn't make sense... ...but with great austerity, the government, those of us... ...who have responsibilities, work for the people. And we don't consider our posts a privilege... ...or a right, but a responsibility... ...an opportunity to serve our fellow citizens. And we have moral authority. That is our secret. We can ask the people: "Just one more effort... ...we can see the light at the end of the tunnel". All the peoples in the world must be united... ...and shout, at the same time, that we want peace. Above all, we need peace. If we live in peace, we can get everything we want. With a good deal of hope... ...if you want a nicer, fairer word... ...with a great deal of dreams... ...putting all that together, making all that a kind of... ...a big... How can I put it? An acqua vita, water of life. If we can get all that to burn... ...in every one of us will arise... ...the solution, or the possible solution to that moment... ...and that circumstance. The blockade is defeated with the strength of the Revolution... ...and the world's solidarity. I'm sure the blockade will be lifted. If not us... ...our children, our grandchildren will see their country developed... ...and free, without the blockade. If we don't want this social system, this government... ...it is our problem. We are the ones who have to fight. Whether to keep it or to overthrow it. But, in this case, the American imperialism... ...arrogates to itself the right of being the world's tutor. "I put or take out the government that suits me." It is a historical reality. Being different has a price. And Cuba is paying it. But it has a prize. Many respect us for our resistance. If you don't fight you won't get the things you want. Besides, which system do you want to impose on me? Latin America hasn't made any progress in 100 years. There is more poverty, underdevelopment, famine. Children don't go to school, they search dumps for food. They polish shoes during school time. The model you want to impose on me doesn't work. The government has done... ...things almost impossible to be done in order to move on. But here we are. With the blockade or without it, we are moving forward. We won't let them oppress us or destroy us... ...for anything in the world. Go Fidel! Little by little the peoples wake up. And some day we'll achieve independence and integration... ...in Latin America. Sooner than later.
