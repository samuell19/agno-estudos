Who is in the wooden men alley? Fang Shih Yu Who is on duty today? Uncle Chen Si Di Fang Shih Yu Still a naive apprentice and yet you stormed the alley Do you know what would happen to you? Yes, if I can't get out I'll have to start again from the beginning More haste less speed, I suggest you go back I am determined to go Do you know why this alley is called the wooden men alley? Yes, although our own brothers are on duty in the alley they'll not spare anyone when fighting their hearts are like wood and stone; hence the name Who is to blame if anyone dies or gets injured? I have only myself to blame Alright Chen Guang Yes Be careful Uncle You can leave Thank you Uncle Fang Shih Yu, hurry and go "Da Mo Hall" Abbot, Fang Shih Yu has stormed the wooden men alley with a knife and killed Chen Guang Please look into this Are you Feng Dao De? Yes Fang Shih Yu would not do such a thing Abbot Zhi Shan, don't you trust us? Brother, we should go Iet's return to Wu Dang We were originally from Wu Dang School we haven't learnt much at Shaolin Temple Let's go... Brother Feng, you are doing right Brother White Brow You know what happened? Zhi Shan suspects us we can't stay at Shaolin anymore We'll fight with Shaolin one day I'll deal with Zhi Shan You have to watch out for Fang Shih Yu Yes Fang Shih Yu's mother bathed him with tonic wine since he was small that makes him sort of invincible Just now though he is cut by Brother Wu's sword I'm afraid he wouldn't be hurt When you meet him in the future in any fight you must lure him to jump and stab him upward while he's still in air This is the only way to pierce into his body Remember this I understand Let's go What are you doing? What do you want? Your uncle owed Master Lei money and has offered you as collateral for the loan Are you off your rocker? You don't even recognise me? Fang Shih Yu He Da Yong You can't just dismiss it with a kick Pick up the flowers from the floor You have to stay in Shaolin for at least 3 years How come you can get out so quickly? By my true and tried skills Go Is Lei still such an outlaw? I don't think no one is able to put a stop to him Not really When Lei Lao Hu knew that you went to Shaolin he started practising the Pile formation Two people who fought him died under the formation Pile formation? That's right beneath these poles are sharp pointed bamboo Once you fall... I buried one of the hero myself He died amidst the pile formation Pile formation? If you haven't practised before you'd better leave as soon as possible Then I won't forcibly get out of wooden men alley The pile formation couldn't stop me You haven't practised on the piles before and in a fight with Lei Lao Hu you'll be at a disadvantage No need to be rash, stay at my home for the night I'll set up the formation for you Practise it at least a few days before you go to him Fang Shih Yu is back Why hasn't he come to me? He's with He Da Yong they are talking about something The men of Lei Lao Hu... "Jin Lun School" Make way... May God bless me with good luck Winner takes all Here, go on with the bet Boss Hu, we're in bad luck today Can you lend us some money? What? Are you kidding? If you need money, there's a pawn shop up the road Hu Yiu Ding, don't you know us? You don't even give us a little face Who are you? Aren't you the instructors of the Jin Lun School?

None of your business Someone's been killed Get away Quiet Hu Huei Chien, listen Head injuries caused your father's death The scar is over 2 inches long Lost at gambling & killed himself by banging his head Nonsense, he's bruised all over would that be due to banging against a wall as well?

You want to defend Jin Lun School I'll settle the score with them myself Instructor, someone's causing trouble at our factory Who is it? Hu Huei Chien Who is this kid?

The factory under Jin Lun School employs over 10,000 workers With expert kung fu instructors from Wu Dang school even the officials are scared of them Guess we better not mess with them We... Get lost, all of you I have to do that You did that once and Iook what happened to you I still want to go, as long as I live I'm going now He's here again Hu Huei Chien, you escaped last time you want to test your luck again?

The people of Jin Lun School are outlaws no one in Guangzhou dares to mess with them except you You are a hero and I don't want you to die If it's not for sale, I'll take it by force Have some tea Inside please... There's a fight upstairs People fighting? Hu Huei Chien is really a hero Only he dares to take on the outlaws of Jin Lun School What a pity he is no match for them though! I think he'll die this time Go quickly I saved you, why do you hit me? I was risking my life, how dare you interfere? I don't think you were risking your life you were in fact giving up your life Who are you? Fang Shih Yu You are the one who killed Lei Lao Hu on the pile formation?

Everybody's here Listen to me Niu Hua Jiao, Lu Ying Bu and a group of people have broken the law and caused much oppression they have got what they deserve Here's the order from now on, don't ever do immoral deeds Hu Huei Chien You shouldn't have crushed the school's plaque Because of Niu Hua Jiao The name of Jin Lun School stinks Crushing this old plaque will do you good Do you know what other people think about you? If people from the factory break the law again I'll beat them up every time I see them Not only have the two of them killed my father they are students of Wu Dang School From Feng Dao De of Wu Dang School conspired with the Qings, oppressed and killed people I can't let them off so easily Cui Ping, let's go Do you really have to go?
