Ayukawa Madoka Kasuga Kyosuke Hiyama Hikaru Kimagure Orange Road: Kimagure Orange Road: I Want To Return To That Day The day the college acceptance lists are to be posted... The north wind whips through our hair, calming us, lending us courage... February. Today, everything ends... yet also is about to begin... Don't worry, Kasuga. You've done your best already. Yeah... "Location of accepted applicants list", "Law Dept.", "Business Majors", "Education Majors" Concerned about your weak muscles? Then come to archery class! Don't cry if you fail! We'll see you next year! We cheerleaders will always be here for you! Don't worry, Ayukawa. We've done our best, haven't we? Oh, Sempai! Please make sure to come and see the play I'm in! "Hey Darling... please make real sure you come and see the play!" Chapter I You'll do just fine, Darling! Please cheer up! It's still only July, you know... That's true, but... It's no surprise you don't quite understand it, Hikaru... ...but upcoming college entrance exams can make a student a lot more apprehensive. But still, there's plenty of time. Why don't you have some of this to let your brain cool down a bit? Yeah... Yippee! Thank you! Aren't freebies great, Darling? When it's your turn, Hikaru, we'll see if you need ice cream therapy too. Oh yeah! Ta-dah! Hey Darling... please make real sure you come see the play! What's that? Eh? It's the special production in honor of next year's graduates. Oh...! "Downtown Cats...?" Wow, a real masterpiece! Yes! And this time especially, as a Koryo graduate, Isao Kobayashi... ...of the Kisetsu-fu Theater Company, is gonna direct the play! That's terrific... Really, it's a big deal... Oh, so that's what Kurumi and Manami were fussing about... You're talking about next year, and auditions have already started? And before the final cast decisions, there'll be a series of tests... Sheesh! That's just like the college entrance process... Oh, come on, Darling...! Don't get so depressed. Dark, gloomy cloud... begone! Actually, I'm going to audition! My... Hikaru in a play? Yup! Hey, hey, Darling, I know you're busy with your studies... ...but please drop by once in a while to cheer me on. 'Cause just for you, Darling, I'll make sure to get the lead! Well, when the time comes... ..."Yippee!" is how I'll try to feel when I go to watch... Oh, please, Darling! You're too funny! Hey, Master... Can I put this poster up in here? Ah, so there you are, Kasuga. Ayukawa... Here you go. I got an extra one for you as well. "Yoyo Seminars for seniors and high school grads" Summer school...? "Yoyo Seminars for seniors and high school grads" Yeah, I checked out a bunch of places; this one seems to be the best deal. What do you think? Hmm... yeah... Madoka! We were just talking about this, but... I'm sorry, but not now... There. That section, Kasuga. What? There. Do you see the schedule? You said you weren't that good with English grammar, so... Yeah... It might be a good place... Oh yeah... I gotta put this up... There are some thumbtacks in the back room. Right! Come on, Kasuga! There's no point in signing up if you're not going to go! That's true... But braving something like this all alone... ...one probably would soon lose the will to continue going... "Yoyo Seminars. Apply now for third semester." Oh, Hikaru! Going somewhere? Yep! A date! A date! See? Let's see if the guys will be able to keep their cool when we wear these! Idiot! If Komatsu and Hatta get any worse... ...how will we deal with them then?! True... I wonder if there aren't some more exciting guys somewhere... They seem to be really hard to find, don't they? But do Komatsu and Hatta really have the time to hang around at the pool? "You'd better give us some money..." ...is what they've told their parents, so it's all right, they say. But more important than that... Hikaru, it was today, wasn't it? How did it go? Um, well... I think I survived. Really?! Our audition is tomorrow... Don't worry. You'll do just fine. Ah! More provisions for the prisoner, eh? 'Cause Darling really loves sweet things! Well, have fun! Dad's out right now, so... if you get him too excited... ...you'll be in trouble! Knock it off, Kurumi! Come on! Come on! Come on! Pleeease...! Oh, you going out too, Jingoro? You must be hot in all that fur... Nameplate: "Kasuga Takashi, Kyosuke, Manami, Kurumi" Let's see... Ayukawa's notes... She said it was written somewhere in here... Hi there! Let's see... now where are the bowls? Darling, I'm gonna root through the cupboard, okay? Uh, should I help? Darling, please stay seated. I'll take care of everything. There you go. Thanks. Sitting here like this, doesn't it feel like we're newlyweds? What...? Please...! You don't have to look so startled! Oh yeah! I better put the ice cream away! You're so bashful, you know... But I'd sure love to cook something healthy and tasty for you here... I mean, if nothing else, I know I'm a good cook! Is it distracting? No, it's got a nice ring. And I can't stand it if it's too quiet. Really? That's great... Oh, you like Wada Kanako? Yeah, you wanna listen? Sure! How nice... I wish I had a CD player, too... I'll dub this for you sometime. Really? Thank you! Oh, why don't we have a little more ice cream? Yeah... Um... What is it? Um... I was... wondering, Darling... ...if there's... anything... ...more that I... could be doing for you... 'Cause I'm younger, you know, and just like ABCB's Master was saying... ...I'm afraid that maybe I can't possibly know... ...how hard it is for you right now... Hikaru... That's not... It was like the sweet taste of coconut-almond... Hikaru... A gift to help cheer you up... The best of luck to you, Darling... So therefore, mark up this section thoroughly... ...and pound the information into your head. Understand? The foundation of your studies should be data. It's no use studying something that won't appear on the exam. Especially, more recent history is what everyone forgets to study... ...but the period from the late Tokugawa to early Showa accounted for 40% of last year's exam... I'm late... Ayukawa... What's wrong, Ayukawa...? Last week... Hikaru came over to your place...? What? Yeah... Sort of a cease-fire from my studies, you might say... "Cease-fire," huh? What? Did Hikaru tell you something? -Did you do something she shouldn't tell me about? -What? Maybe... you even kissed her. Hikaru looked so happy. Nice going. Now wait just a minute...! It's all right. It doesn't matter to me. But you're wrong! We didn't do anything! Ayukawa! Liar! Ayukawa! Hey! You in the back row! You should've settled all your problems d'amour last year! Hello? A... Ayukawa...? Would you like some fries with that? Uh... Sure... One order of fries, then. Thank you very much! Just a minute, please. Good afternoon! I can help you over here! Darling, over here! Oh yeah, Darling... Do you like this color? Uh... Yeah... I like it. Really? That's great! I'll knit you a scarf with this then. Soon it'll get colder, and you can't afford to catch cold, can you? I've already decided on the design. Let's see, it goes like this, and this part is like this, and... Huh? How did this part go in Madoka's book? Ayukawa's...? Don't you know? Madoka is really into knitting. She's got tons of design books! Oh...? You know the festival's coming up, right? Madoka always starts knitting something around this time of year. Yeah...! Can we go to the festival together, Darling? Hey, are you listening? What? Geez... you're not listening, are you? The festival. The festival! We all went together last year, remember? Yeah... but... Ah, you can't, can you? You don't have the time, do you? I've said something really stupid again! Stupid! Stupid! Hikaru... It's okay. Please don't worry about it. We can always go to the festival together next year, after all! So anyway, how's the play going? It's so much work! But I sure wish this was downtown New York, like the setting of the play... Huh? What do you mean? Because... over there, even in places like this, it's all right to... you know! Wh... what? Did it reach you, Darling? I'm certainly impressed. You're doing pretty well on your own, Madoka. I suppose so... It's cleaner than when you were around, isn't it, Oneechan? Yeah, right... Anyway... Is that everything Mom wanted me to send to her? Yeah, I packed all of it. But you know, she really didn't have to send the letter to you... I could've sent off this much myself... She's just acting like any parent whose child is studying for the exams. Mom and Dad are pretty busy with the tour and all... ...but they're always thinking about you. -Brother-in-law... can you get these? -Sure. Hmm... That polo shirt of his... did you knit that? Yup! He wouldn't dare flirt with other women, wearing his wife's hand-knit, right? Is that so...? Oh yeah! Madoka, have you paid the town council fee for the festival? Yeah. See you later then, Madoka. Bye. Wow! An airship! Yeah... Well... I guess it's goodbye for another few days... I don't want to be apart... Chapter II What's the matter? Huh? My... H... Huh? Finally awake, Kasuga? Aren't you studying a bit too hard? Right, right! Here you lay down for just a second, and immediately you're snoring! I think I was dreaming... Something dirty, no doubt. But seriously, is this really the extent of your collection? What? You really can't get off on some of this stuff... You guys! What are you doing, looking through those things?! Didn't you come here to study?! But she has such a pretty face, and check out those tits! What a bod, huh? Huh? Wherewherewhere? "If you want to have a telephone date with Saori..." Kasuga! Kasuga! The phone! The phone! And Tissues! Tissues! Idiots. That one's from last year. What...? Damn... Ah, well... Man... this sucks! Why do the college entrance exams have to be... ...right when we're hitting our sexual peak? Right! Right! The more I think "I gotta study, I gotta study..." ...the more I think "I want to... I want to do it!"... you know? Aren't you overdoing things a bit, though? There are bags under your eyes. Oh, can you tell? Well, I didn't want other people calling me a nerd... ...so I've been hiding the fact that I've been studying so hard... ...but I guess you've found me out. Yes, I've found you out! But we're not talking about studying, now, are we?! Oh, you mean "that!" Man... Hey Kasuga! Speaking of which... you must've scored with Hikaru by now, eh? What...? Don't try to hide it, you devil! Right! Right, right! Spit it out! After all, compared to Ayukawa, she'd be an easy fish to catch! Oh, you think so too, Hatta? Of course! Of course! Will you two cut it out?! I've never... Oh sure... play innocent. So you mean you've never even thought about "doing it" with her? Eh...? Well... I, uh... You have, right? Yeah... See...? On top of that, she's just crazy about you! It'd be cruel to ignore her! Right, Hatta? Yeah, that's right! That's right! Hey, hey...! Yes, that's it! And then turn there! All right... very good! Okay, next! Female cats, onstage! Hikaru! Hurry! Hurry! Okay...! All right, cats... we'll continue from where we left off last time. Next, I'll explain how to work out problem 3. First, take a look at choice #1. This expands upon an idea which is stated in the problem. However, you must keep in mind that, if you read carefully enough, you'll find... ...that no such concept is substantiated anywhere in the problem itself... Oh, you! You're Kasuga, right? Yes, sir. And like a certain "Miss Ayukawa," you're from Koryo High, right? That's right, but... Here. She hasn't been here the last few days... Take these notes to her. You'll see her, won't you? Yeah... Today's friend may be tomorrow's enemy... ...but can also be a comrade-in-arms in the field of battle. Take those to her. Yes, sir! Heeey...! There isn't a single shot with just the two of us! "Dad," you sure are a pro! I mean... the way you capture your subjects demonstrates your skill! Look here... See this young and lovely double couple? They look so lively! What are you saying about lovely couples? Dad specializes in scenery photos! That's right! He took the festival photography job because it was for our town. Right, Dad? Yeah, more or less... From what I heard, they're going to do even more fireworks than usual... But I really am impressed...! He sure is a pro! Hey! I already said that! But he took these just a little while ago, and they're already finished... Wow...! I'm struck with admiration! Hey! Don't touch! Shoo, shoo! Yo, "Dad!" You're gonna be going to take pictures of the fireworks, right? Yeah... Then we'll watch the house with Kurumi and Manami for you! No, you idiot! We'll help you out, "Dad!" Oh, but he doesn't need you two anymore! 'Cause it'll be night time, so he won't need that thing! Well, I know you're busy studying for your exams, so thanks for all your help. Study hard, tonight. Uh, yeah... Bye... "Study hard...?" Oh, going home? See you again! Oh, Kurumi! Manami! Make sure to make Kyosuke something to eat, okay? Right! Speaking of him, is Kasuga still taking that summer course with Ayukawa? Yep! But for some reason, Madoka hasn't been going for the past 2 or 3 days... Oh...? Maybe that's why he seemed kinda down yesterday. Anyway... Manami! What should we wear tonight? Yeah... We can't both wear the same style yukata, after all... I see...! Madoka, you're so good... I just can't seem to get the pattern to go right, you know...? Here. Try it again. Does it look good? I had to smuggle those oranges out of my house, you know. My mom is such a scrooge, she even stores away gifts of food! But food is always best eaten fresh! Right, Madoka? Oh, it slipped out again! I guess those needles are a bit slippery. -There're some better ones up in my room, so why don't you bring them down? -Right! Oh, can I start on the oranges? Go right ahead! Oh, did you find them, Hikaru? Yes, yes! These, right? Hmm... But, if I'm this slow, I wonder if I'll finish it before his birthday? Birthday? Yup! November 15th... It sounds kinda far, but it's not all that far away, is it? So... So that's for... Kasuga... I bought this yukata... to show respect for my dad. He was all, "I'd like to see you in a yukata, at least for the festival!" So I go, "Well you better give me some money, then!" So that's the deal! You never change, do you, Hikaru? Huh? What do you mean? Since long ago, there've always been times when I've envied certain things about you. What're you talking about, Madoka?! Like... always being happy from the bottom of your heart. People like that are well-liked... You're making it sound like I'm stupid or something! What...? No, no! That's not what I meant... So, are you going to the festival with Kasuga? What? Uh, unfortunately, no. He doesn't seem to be feeling up to it. You're... the same, aren't you? Yeah... I suppose so... Don't all of a sudden stare at me... ...just because I've gone silent. No matter what you say to me now... ...I have a feeling it will hurt. Kasuga...! ...I have a feeling it will hurt. On a terrace in the afternoon light... ...unsuited to talk of breaking up... ...the feelings that torment you... ...are melting in the ice tea too. "I love you, I love you." You whispered it just last night. "I love you, I love you." How untrustworthy those words are. I pretended not to notice... ...the rumors my friends were telling. I wanted just once more... ...to believe in you. On a noisy, crowded street... Hello, Kasuga residence. Hello...? Hello...? Ayukawa... It's Ayukawa, isn't it? Hello? Ayukawa? I... Ayukawa... I've done a foolish thing... What? Just a while ago... I put on my yukata... ...hoping it'd make me feel better... I mean, I... just couldn't keep my mind on my studies... And so... And so... it's a stupid thing, but... today's the festival... And somehow... I really didn't feel like going... But then... trying to study wouldn't do me any good, right? Yeah... And so... thinking maybe it'd make me feel a little better... I put on my yukata... Yeah... And then... I started thinking about all sorts of things... I... I thought... ...I thought I knew how you felt... ...I took it for granted that you liked me... ...and maybe what happened with Hikaru... ...is my punishment for assuming that... But, no...! It's my fault... I'm to blame... I... Ayukawa, I've... ...always loved you. Kasuga... I want to see you... Ayukawa... I've been such a fool, haven't I...? Kasuga, I... I'm not all that strong, you know... Ayukawa... Um... about Hikaru...? No, it's not so much about Hikaru. It's more a matter of your true feelings. I understand. Nameplate: "Hiyama" Let's see how this looks on you, Kumagoro! Lookin' good! Lookin' good! Huh? Now, how many did I just do...? Let's see... Hikaru? Kasuga's on the line! Darling! Ding ding ding! Oh, I'm just so moved that you actually called me up when you're so busy! Hikaru... What's wrong...? Well, please sit down, anyway! Yeah... Hey, I was just looking through this, see? There's a Wada Kanako concert in September. So would you like to go together? Even you need a little break once in a while... Hikaru... Yes? I... really... ...don't think we should... see each other anymore... What...? Because... I really... Oh, come on! What are you saying...?! Don't joke around like this! Because... I really... ...love Ayukawa... I've really enjoyed... all the times I've spent with you, but... It just can't go on like this, so... I thought I had better make things clear... No... No... It's not possible. I don't believe it! I knew all along... that you loved Madoka... I knew, but... I thought I'd managed to change that... 'Cause you kissed me, didn't you?! I'm sorry... Why...? Why am I not good enough? Next, Hiyama! Hiyama Hikaru! Hiyama, you here? Hikaru! What? You're up, Hikaru... Oh! R... Right! "Why? Why are you treating me like I'm an outcast?" "What have I ever done here in this town?" "I'm a hooker, you say? But why is that so terrible?" "Well in that case... why do you not support me?" "Hey, don't run from me! Don't run, I said! I'm not..." "I'm not..." "Hey, don't run from me! Don't run, I said! I'm... not..." "Don't run from me! I... I'm..." Next, Horikoshi! Yes, sir! Hiyama! How do you expect to get the part if you can't memorize your lines?! Y... Yes, sir! What's wrong, Hikaru? You don't look so good... It's nothing! It's nothing at all! Hello? It's me! What? I... I know! I know that, Darling! Oh, that's right! I shouldn't call you "Darling" anymore, huh, Kasuga-sempai? Sempai...! Sempai...! Of course! So anyway, I got some of my allowance today, and so I... ...I was just thinking maybe I could bring over some snacks... Yes... Yes...! Yes, I know I shouldn't see you anymore...! Hikaru... Yes... I remember everything that you said! Right. 'Bye, then. I'm going now... Oh, then Kasuga-sempai... good luck in your studies! I'll call again! Chapter III Ayukawa! 'Morning. Okay, today I'm going to cover the important guidelines for solving... ...paragraph problems, so listen well. Open your texts to page 89... This is from Musashi University's exam of 2 years ago. I hope everybody's read the problem. Well then, let's start looking through the possible answers... "Did you see Hikaru? Circle one: YES. NO." "Yes. Day before yesterday." "And what happened?" "I told her we shouldn't see each other anymore, but..." But Hikaru isn't going to just accept that, you know... Yeah... That you and Hikaru were getting along so well... ...I'd always told myself that it didn't really matter to me... ...but when... Hikaru so cheerfully told me about... you and her kissing... ...I found out I was wrong... Ayukawa... I never knew I was this jealous... But I... ...I really do love you, Ayukawa... We'll have to settle all of this pretty soon, won't we? And you're listening to "Kawai Yoko's Midnight Talk!" Let's take a look at the next letter! This is from a troubled 16-year-old girl... "Miss Kawai, please listen. My boyfriend, whom I'll call 'H' for now, is a classmate..." "...but I recently found out that 'H' is also seeing another girl..." Oniichan? Telephone... It's Hikaru... Yes? Nameplate: "Hiyama" And so, I was given them, and... I really, really got them for free, and so... ...I have tickets to the Wada Kanako concert... ...and I was thinking you might need a little break... Do you think you'll have the time...? Why won't you say anything? Is it that you won't even talk to me anymore...? I can't believe that...! Don't phone me anymore, okay...? Bye... Hikaru was crying, you know... Oniichan...! What are you doing here? I thought I told you... Snack provisions! Please go home. I have to leave for the summer course soon. To go study with Madoka? I'll walk with you to the station! To keep you company! Hikaru, how long are you going to keep going on like this? Until you... return to me. I told you already! I'm... But I can't just let go...! 'Cause... every day, whenever anything happens... ...I really want to tell you about it first... There's lots of things I want to talk with you about... ...lots of places I want to go with you to... Bye... Sempai! It looks like I'm gonna get the lead role! And I'll work real hard to make sure I do, so please come to watch! Okay? Okay? The summer course is finally over, huh? And second semester starts next week... Summer vacation sure is short... Really... Say, you wanna catch a movie this Sunday? We probably won't get another chance to for a while... Yeah, not a bad idea... Good. I'll phone you, then. Okay. See ya. Don't ignore me! Will you cut it out, already?! Hmm, sure is raining hard... Might as well close up for today... Hikaru... I'll lock the place up later, so... why don't you go on home? Sure. Thanks, then, Madoka. It'll get cold... I know, Hikaru... I'm sorry... Don't apologize now, Madoka! I've known all along... that Kasuga-sempai... has always been in love with you... Even so... I clung to the hope that there was something I could do to... You never had to do anything! It's not fair! Madoka, what have you ever done for him?! I can do anything! If it's for him, I can do anything! Hikaru... I guess it really can't be the three of us anymore... Idiot! Why do you have to think like that? Kazuya, I love both you and Tatsuya! Ever since we were little, it's always been the three of us, hasn't it? And we'll always be together from now on, too. That's how it should be...! From now on, for always...? Yes! Forever and ever... and ever! Yeah...! I'm probably just a little stressed, with the big game before us and all... But next stop, the National Championships...! -The downfall of the Kamakura Shogunate. -1333. -The Kyoho Reformation. -1716. -Okay, the prohibition of the sale of farmland. -Um... 1643. Hmm... not bad! -Which came first, the Koan or Bun'ei War? -Koan. Bzzzt! -Hmm. Okay, how about this? The landing of the "Riifude." -1600. -The Great Ansei Crackdown. -1858. Okay, what treaty was signed that very same year? Um... Let's see... The Japan-U.S. Peace Treaty? The Japan-U.S. Trade and Commerce Treaty. Okay then... how about 1969? What...? What was that...? The year we were born! Yeah, that's right... It's all over for us! Ushiko! Please come home! Shikao is crying, too! It's a big hit... ...crime committed in 1980... Hikaru, where are you going? Out... Oniichan! Oniichan! Telephone... For... You! What are you thinking, coming here this late at night? Darling, please let me come inside... There's a practice exam tomorrow! I was thinking of going to bed, already! I got the lead role... And the posters with my name on them have been printed up... ...and I thought maybe you'd want one, so I brought one for you! I can't take that. And... ...I probably won't go to the play, either. I'm going back home, now... Let go! Let go of me! I won't let go! I won't let go...! 'Cause if I let go of you, you'll leave me! You'll go away and leave me behind! I just can't give up on you...! Why don't you like me anymore...? What was I to you, anyway...? ANSWER ME! When I fell in love... ...when I lost love... ...I looked up at the sky... ...swinging in my swing, with tears in my eyes. I believed unendingly... ...that if I swung hard enough... ...I would reach that sky... ...and shine in blue. Hold Me Again. At no time does time wait for me. It passes me by like the clouds... ...even though I call for it to stop. Hold Me Again. Though we drift apart here and there... ...I will never forget... ...the sky that day -- I will hold it in my heart. Farewell... Hikaru... How did today's practice exam go? Not good at all... I know... You didn't get much sleep, did you? I phoned your place last night... ...and Kurumi told me that you and Hikaru had gone out somewhere... Actually... About last night... I see... Hey, even though things ended up like this... ...will you let me believe in you... and in how you feel about me? Yeah... Then I won't blame you. If I did, you'd have no one to turn to. Kasuga! Huh? Yeah...! Hikaru's play opens today, doesn't it? Yeah... It should be starting pretty soon... "Oh no! You mean you still have these pictures, Madoka...?" "This is Hikaru?! When was this?" "Seven... maybe eight years ago...? She had the mumps. Looks pretty bad, huh?" "How can you do this to me?!" "Ah, but I played with you then, remember? You should show some gratitude!" "Huh? Played with her...? Then this kid who's standing next to Hikaru..." "...isn't a boy... but is really Ayukawa...?" "Oh, come on, Darling! Who else could that be but Madoka?" "Please, Kasuga...!" And Ayukawa and I... ...were both accepted. When I fell in love... ...when I lost love... ...I looked up at the sky... ...swinging in my swing, with tears in my eyes. I believed unendingly... ...that if I swung hard enough... ...I would reach that sky... ...and shine in blue. Hold Me Again. At no time does time wait for me. It passes me by like the clouds... ...even though I call for it to stop. Hold Me Again. Though we drift apart here and there... ...I will never forget... ...the sky that day -- I will hold it in my heart. I swung on... ...a slightly cramped swing. The sky I loved... ...was terribly small. Hold Me Again. Time keeps passing me by... ...while stealing... ...even my peace of mind. Hold Me Again. No matter how dark it gets... ...I will not forget... ...the brilliant sky of that day... ...I will hold it in my heart. Hold Me Again in that sky. You did well, Hiyama. Thank you! Bang! (fin)
