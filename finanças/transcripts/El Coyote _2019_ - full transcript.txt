(bell chiming) (western guitar melody) (wind howling) (suspenseful atmosphere music) (shooting) (speaking in foreign language) - [Mannie] They're shooting, homie! (shooting) - [Shooter] New plan today, motherfucker! Get him, esse! Get him! - [Mannie] I'm trying to drive! - Then drive the car! (speaking in foreign language) (shooting) You're dead, bitch! (shouting in foreign language) - [Shooter] Fuck Mannie, what the hell did we get ourselves into, esse? (shooting) (music intensifying) (shooting) - Get them! Don't let them get away, go! - You're dead, cabron! (shooting) - Put it down! Put it down, motherfucker! Put it down! - Freeze, motherfucker! - Over there! Right there! (ominous atmosphere music) - Tough guy huh? Fuck you looking at? What? What? Fuck you gonna do? Nothing. Get down on your fucking knees. Get your fucking hands off me. - You're one dirty (mumbles). - [Gangster] Don't fucking touch me. - We fucking trusted you, asshole. (speaking in foreign language) - Where did you think you were gonna go? (shooting) Did I fucking say to shoot? - No. - Did I fucking tell you? - No. - Dumb fuck. Bitch. Yeah, fucking shake. Fucking shake! (mock quivering) You afraid? - Si. - You should be fucking scared, bitch. The fuck you think? You were gonna get away with it? (mock quivering) What are you gonna do? Fucking leave with my missile? And fucking take off? (speaking in foreign language) - I don't give a fuck. (speaking in foreign language) - You should've thought of that huh? (speaking in foreign language) - A lady? - Si. - A mujer? - Si. - I'll take care of your fucking lady. (laughing) (praying in foreign language) Adios, motherfucker! (blood splattering) (dramatic orchestra music) (plane whirring) (dramatic atmosphere music) (speaking in foreign language) - Just you. - What we got? - We've had eyes on two small groups of illegals who crossed at 0500. Bennet and Lambert took Macintosh to get the first group. Orders came in to stand down on this one though. - Why? Civilian paramilitary? - No, not this time. There's growing movement on Mexicans jacking their own people after they've crossed. Squeezing them for all they've saved, which is all they've got. - Rolling over on their own people. How noble. - They force the men to work or kill them. Rape and traffic the women. - They keep this up and you'll be out of a job. Won't even need a damn wall. - Without their parents, the youngest kids are gonna die in the desert. - Not today. You and your team take the bait. Me, Davis, and Busby, we'll take the (mumbles) banditos. No offense. (shooting) (shouting in foreign language) (shooting) (guns cocking) (weeping) - (laughs) Welcome to America. Do you want to be next? (guns cocking) - Please run. Come on. Do it! Now if any of you can get me drunk enough at this bachelor party, I'll tell you all about this tight ass back here. - [Officer] Sounds like you know a thing or two about it. - Bushman, I'm talking about you. - No way, none of you bitches are even invited. Especially not you, Bushman. (shooting) - Ambush, ambush! (suspenseful atmosphere music) - Jax, you all right? - It's okay Pete. I got you, you're good. - Liddy. - I'll tell her. I'll tell her, I promise. I need cover! (shooting) (menacing laugh) - Poor thing. - Come out, cabron! Pinche puto! (music intensifying) (shooting) Now quit wasting my motherfucking time and come out before I shoot this one. - Okay! Okay. Okay, I'm coming out. - I pictured you being taller. - Who the fuck are you? - Who the fuck am I? Come here, Captain Jax. I hope that within time you will see me as your worst motherfucking nightmare. (classical piano music) - Mmmm. - How are you folks doing tonight? You guys doing all right? - We're doing fine, thank you. - We're fine, thanks. - You're welcome. - Very nice chap. - Go to Mexico. - Amen. - Damn tootin'. - Francesco, let's go! Today, while we're still alive! - More minestrone, por favor. We can't get enough over here. Oh my god. - Do the thing. (speaking in foreign language) - That's what I'm talking about. Right there, Francesco, is the reason why you're my favorite nephew. This place could be yours someday. - That'll be really fun. - Let's go do this thing huh? (speaking in foreign language) (foreign opera music) - Nice to see you again. - Good to see you. - Hey, how are you? Good to see you. Young man, nice to see you. Thank you so much for coming out. Hey, was I right about the spinach? Amazing huh? Did I tell you or did I frickin' tell you huh? All right gentlemen. You two, oh marone huh? Enjoying dinner? What's happening? All right good, you old people, how are you? What's happening? Hey little one, how are you? - How you doing? - I'm doing fine, I'm doing fine. (laughing) Hey, so how you doing again? Nice to see you. Been a long time. Hey how are you Jill, all right? Thank you for coming. It's the family huh? Looks like a wedding. Tony, you did a good thing today. Great service. Good lord man, take your bride home already. (laughing) You're a lucky fella. Bada bing bada boom, you know what I mean? You, you could put an eye out with those things. - Bad boy. - There's so much wood under this table the fire department's gonna shut me down. You know what I mean? Holy cow. I gotta get out of here, can I take her with me? I'm just kidding, I gotta go. See you later. Thanks everybody. (groaning) (ominous atmosphere music) - Where's Davis? - Agent Davis? Mr. Davis is having fun with some of my friends. - What do you want from us? - You see, you and your friend have made quite an impression in protecting the border. The few. The proud. And it is true that there are few of you now. I am so proud of that. Unfortunately, you have made it very challenging for me and friends. (speaking in foreign language) - Matutero. - Oh, you know about us? I am so flattered. (whip cracking) (man screaming) Ouch. Do you hear that? Sounds like they're having a lot of fun. Fuck this. Let's cut to the chase. You're gonna make some calls. And making everything back to normal. Nothing personal. It's just business. - Fuck you! - Fuck me? Fuck me! - I'm not scared to die. - Maybe not. But what about sweet Carmen? Or maybe Sophia? Maybe they are. You ever think about that? Estupido. Don't fuck with me. That's okay. You have it your way. Pendejo. - Wait! I might know someone. - Oh good. I thought you would. - Look at you. - Mom, stop. - It is going by too fast. - You think he'll like it? - Mmmhm. I do. I do. Maybe a little too much. (doorbell ringing) Go have fun. (gentle piano atmosphere music) Hi! - How you doing? - For me? - Honey, you look beautiful. - Daddy. - There's something I wanted to tell you. (knocking) - Knocky knock knock! 'Sup people? Scoot over there, Pops. - Hi Tanner. - Beep beep, coming through. This bud's for you. - This is your date? Really? - Yeah daddy, let him in. That's Tanner. - Dude, what the heck? I'm starving. - Okay, you and I? We're gonna go have a walk, come on. - Daddy, be nice. - Sorry, I kinda munched on it a little. (laughing) - Hey, hey! - Son, I need you to put the bong down long enough to understand something. There's nothing more important in my life than that little girl up there. I don't know if she lost a bet or what. But we both know that she's out of your league. And I wanna make sure that we both understand that I would do anything to protect her. Anything. And if anything bad would happen to her, I feel sorry for those guys. - Whoa. Nice wheels. - Yeah, well thanks. You know, these trunks aren't bad. - Dude. - So you know, you could put two people in that trunk, it's so big. So what were we talking about? - That I need to have your daughter home very early. - Now that's a great idea. You know Tucker, you're really starting to grow on me. - It's Tanner. - Yeah, whatever. Beat it. Nice talk. - You said 50 bucks! - Oh yeah, my bad. Here. You want me to take you to... Yeah, whatever. (car revving) (phone ringing) Go for Spencer. - [Gangster] Listen up, payaso. - Who is this? - [Gangster] I work for the Matutero Cartel. - How'd you get my number? - [Gangster] You need to do a job for us. We'll text you where. - Yeah, I'll be there. (ominous atmosphere music) - You know that's bad for you right? - So is not returning my phone calls. (chuckling) - You think you're the only politician on our speed dial, huh puto? - Hey man, lighten up. You cartels are so uptight. I came all the way down here with the support of those fine people of the Sunshine State, who send their regards by the way, and I'd hate to go home empty handed. It'd be like going to Taco Bell in Tijuana. That shit doesn't make any sense, you know? But I love what you've done with the place. Smells like shit though. Smells like... No wonder you wanna get out of this place. - I thought we were clear on we're terms, Senator. - Oh well. I can always start doing business with Lorenzo. - What do you mean by that? - Hey fuck you. I need to renegotiate. End of story. (laughing) No. Fuck you, pendejo. Fuck you. (distant clinking) - (gasps) You! - You scared me half to death, man. - Shit, I nearly shit my pants, Uncle Stony. What are you doing here? - I came to get some things. - You okay boss? You seem kinda off. - Yeah, I'll be okay though. - Just wanna make sure you're okay. - Training boy, go home. Spend some time with the family. Make breakfast for the kids. Best of all, make love to your wife in the daytime. Now get outta here. - I just wanna make sure you're okay. - I'm okay, capiche? Get outta here. (tracker beeping) (car horn blaring) Pretty please, God, no! No no! (tires screeching) The fuck? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for leaving you. I gotta go, I'm gonna make this right. - [Gangster] Mira. Keep an eye out for him. (Spanish rock music) - Morning. You got that kinda flip-flopped there. There you go. "Thank you." There you go, you're welcome. (speaking in foreign language) - Good talk there, Poncho. I don't know what they're paying you, but it's too damn much. (ominous atmosphere music) (speaking in foreign language) - So you are the cook. - Chef. Here's my card. - Drink? - I don't drink. I like to cook. - Power. What's your power? - I'm Italian. - Make pasta not war? - Kinda cute. You know, it's like a tagline. - What kind of name is Stone? - Kids are mean. Got teased when I was a kid. You know, sticks and stones? This one time I got really pissed off. I threw a rock at a shortstop. Jose Rodriguez. The name just kinda stuck. Our coach saw that I could throw hard and moved me over to to pitcher. No one's fucked with me ever since. No, that's not quite true. I had a run in with a guy at work 20 years ago. By the name of Guadeloupe Gonzalez. I guess I don't get along with Mexicans. Damn. You should've been a therapist. I haven't opened up like this in years. Feels good. So what are we doing here? - It appears we've made some kind of mistake. - Mistake? - You see, I need someone with special skills. Not some old pasta cook. (laughing) - Look, I might be a little bit old, but I'm your guy. I can get shit done. - You know why you're here? - Enlighten me. - We blew our cover and we need your help. - Again? - We'll owe you. I'll owe you. - You still owe me for the last two hits I did for you and your guys. - We need you to do the Italian thing again. - It's what I do. I don't know. - Come on, we're friends. - If I do this, it's for the last time. - Last time. Promise. - What's the mark? (speaking in foreign language) (laughing) - Escuchame. I have a very important present coming from Cuba. We need someone to make sure it arrives safely. It is fragile. And I don't like my presents being tampered with or opened. Especially before I do. Spoils the surprise. - Why me? - It appears I have something you want in exchange for something that I want. It's the world's oldest business transaction. - What? You wanna blow me? Come on, man. - It's a trade. Nothing personal. Just business. But make no mistake, senorita Spencer. I am very committed to my business. And no one, especially some old pasta cook, is gonna stop me. - How do I know he's still alive? - You don't. Actually I saw him today. But I can't say he was having his best day. (chuckling) (speaking in foreign language) - Hang in there, kid. - Dad! Don't do it! They know about mom and-- - Dad? You gotta be kidding me. You're his fucking daddy? (laughing) This is fucking awesome. - Yeah, you're right. America's greatest dad. Actually we haven't seen each other in a while. A long while. - Look, I get no joy from killing your son. But I will if I have to. Especially if you don't have what I need in three days. (speaking in foreign language) (ominous atmosphere music) (knocking) - I'm gonna get you, buddy. Just hang on. - Mom. - Yes baby girl? - You think dad will ever, you know... - Come back? Aren't you supposed to be helping me? Carmen honey, I don't know. I don't know. And you know, I gotta tell you that things are actually pretty good right now. Maybe we're better off as friends. Sweet girl, your dad is... He's very hard to be married to sometimes. But I want you to know that I love him very much. - But I know that he loves you. - He's married to the restaurant. And we don't do anything exciting anymore. You can set your clock by the guy. It's the same thing every day. He's boring. (speaking in foreign language) - You will go with my men to Mexico. And (mumbles) a safe passage across the border. Here. This is where the cargo will load into the plane. - A plane? How am I supposed to get a friggin' plane? - You have connections. Make it happen. Mira. You will take the first payment here. What is that? What are you doing with your eyes? Can you see or not? - I can see fine. - You can see fine? You gotta be fucking kidding me. You cannot fuck this up. Can you see or not? - I got it. - Good. You will continue with the immigrants from Sonata. Across the Arizona border. Where you will deliver them and take the second payment. These passengers are very important to me. You screw this up, do me a favor and just put a fucking bullet in your head and consider yourself dead. (speaking in foreign language) - I got it, El Chopo Whopo. - Once I have confirmation, your son will be released. And you will never hear from us again. - And I'm supposed to take your word as a Catholic? - Mira, amigo. We are just doing our jobs. We are very alike, whether you like it or not. - Well to me it's gonna look like I'm gonna throw in. - [Player] Fuck you always have to be the big baller? - Because I think I can beat you guys. Okay? - [Player] Only thing you beat me with is age. - Come on guys, just let him (mumbles). - [Second Player] Why you let him punk you like that, Gordido? - 'Cause he's my little baby. (speaking in foreign language) (coughing) (ominous atmosphere music) - I got you, buddy. - Thank god you're here. (groaning) - Come on, man. Let's get out of here. (distant conversing) - [Old Man] Taught me a couple of things over here. - Hey hey, let's just... - [Old Man] All right. I'm gonna make the bet. (ominous atmosphere music) - Who won? That wasn't here. Who fucking won? - Jefecito, I watched that fucker good. I've been with you cinco anos. - Por favor. It won't happen again. - Then who was sitting here? (speaking in foreign language) - Pablo. - Pablo? - [Old Man] Sir senor. - Pablo. Pablo. (shooting) Congratulations. But you never fucking betray your friends. Pinche pendejos. - Vamanos! Get these fuckers! (groaning) - Stay here. - Jax! - I'll be back for you. Just trust me. - Go. Go! (coughing) (shooting) (groaning) - Jax. You must have less faith in your father than I do. Pendejo. This is all your fault. (shooting) Put him in the freezer. - Hey, it's just me. I don't know if you got my text, but she really likes this Tanner kid. So anyway, give me a call if you're home. Sorry. (ominous atmosphere music) - You make sure that Spencer knows you and I bumped into each other. (speaking in foreign language) - What? You never had skid marks before? - Hey! Vamanos! Mr. Spencer. You know, when I was a young boy, I lived in the desert for many years with my brothers in casas. We would study los animales. El Coyote. El Coyote would look out for his family. He would fight to death to protect his home. You. You have a soft spot for these people. I can see. El Coyote. I can see you're a good man and you don't belong here. You see, in this business you have to learn to look the other way. Entiendes? You'll get it. It's time. Take him. - Move! I can't drive this pinche truck. - I'll drive it. (honking) (phone ringing) (speaking in foreign language) - I'm hearing good things. - Everything is on track. There will be no more delays. - There cannot. I'm counting on you, Miguel. - My family means the world to me. - Others have disappointed me. They had to be put down. But I see a bright future for you. - You will have your money. Plus interest. Just like I promised. (speaking in foreign language) - Let me know when the delivery arrives. - Mierda. (speaking in foreign language) - You gonna feed those people? - Fuck those people! - Hey, you feel them, gringo. And if anyone escapes, you die. - Where they gonna go, Vegas? Dumbass. It's not much. Pass it on to everyone. Everyone. Share as best you can. I got another apple here. (banging) - Back in the truck! Now! - Where's my phone? - Tweedle Dee, dumb and dumber, get up! We're here! (phone ringing) (phone buzzing) (speaking in foreign language) - Your short game sucks. - Everything's on track. There will be no more delays. - You know, my mother always used to say never count your chickens before they are hatched. And you know, I never understood what she meant by that. Until I made the error of employing you. - It was never my intention to cause any embarrassment. My family means the world to me. - Let me be very fucking clear. You better come up with that trigger, or I will be forced to leave the runt of the litter behind. - You will have your money. Plus interest, just like I promised. - You never write a fucking check that your ass cannot cash. Three days and I cannot protect you anymore. Don't fucking forget who you're talking to. Three days! And I can no longer protect you! (shouting in foreign language) (mumbling in foreign language) - So fucking little. - Harder to find you, my dear. Look at what you've been able to do with a little one. Very impressive. I think we're getting really close to each other here. No? - No. No way. - Ayudame, stop fucking around. (ominous atmosphere music) (suspenseful atmosphere music) - The fuck? - Hold it right there! - Grenade, let's go! Go, get them, come on! (shooting) - Hey, get over here motherfucker! Get over here! Get over here! Aw shit. (shooting) - Get down! - Senior Jax. I have good news for you. Your dad. The cook made his first drop off. Looks like I misjudged him. - You... Have no idea. (clearing throat) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Put her in my car. (laughing) - I need you to survive. I need you to take care of your mommy. And you gotta come find me someday. Do you promise? - I promise. (sirens wailing) (speaking in foreign language) (knocking) - Evening fellas. You look lost. I don't see a Taco Bell around here. How about you let me see your license and registration. - Evening sir. Is there a problem officer? - Oh my god. Oh my god, it's you! You're the guy! The guy from the movies! Hey hey, what am I a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh? I'm here to amuse you? Come on, you're the guy! - (chuckles) I get that all the time. - Oh come on. You gotta say that. Oh god, what's that guy? That actor off The Sopranos. My wife's gonna kill me. Hey, I'm Officer Bianci. - Well Officer Bianci, it's a pleasure and an honor to have a fellow Italian way the fuck out of here. I was just telling my Mexican jumping bean bodyguards about our food back home. - Oof, marone. Hey, tell me about it. What I wouldn't give for some of my grandma's homemade ossobuco alla milanese. - (chuckling) Wow, I just think I creamed my jeans. (laughing) - That's great. - Yeah, they don't get it. They just don't get it. Yeah, what a strange country Mexico huh? Am I right or am I right? - Tell me about it. - I told these guys that Mexico couldn't have an Olympic team because all the swimmers, jumpers, and runners are already in the US. (laughing) - Hey that's great, man. That's just great. Hey listen, can I get a quick picture with you? - Yeah sure. - All right, hey. My wife, she's never gonna believe this one. All right. (laughs) All right. - I gotta go. Gotta get to the set. - Hey thanks a bunch, mate. You really made my day. Hey listen, I got one for you. How do you stop a Mexican tank? - Easy. Shoot the three guys out pushing it. (laughing) Later Officer. - Hey great, man. Hey, I'll see you. - Fucking nuts, pull out here guys. Hey, what are you guys, camels? Don't you ever pee? Man I gotta use the restroom. - Fuck. (speaking in foreign language) - No, no, number one. No, not number one. Number uno, number, how do you say in Spanish, numero... Shit man, I gotta take a shit! - Cerote? - Si. - Aw shit! Fuck. Hey! Put the fucking briefcase down! - This may be too much information, but I like to use wet wipes. Take them with me everywhere. What? You don't wipe a baby's ass with toilet paper do you? You should try it, change your life. (speaking in foreign language) (store bell ringing) Yo Lollypop, where's the john? - The men's is out of order. - I'll use the ladies room. - You can't go in there. Sir! Baby boomers. Dick. - Excuse me? I'd like to wash my hands. - Beat it, please? For the lollipops. (laughing) (speaking in foreign language) - That's right, motherfucker. - You did good. You got a good head. - What, you give good head? Good to know. - Oh si, si. - Who is that? - Hector. (speaking in foreign language) - Fuck. Could you get any brighter of a car? Shit's fucking burning my eyes. - What, you don't like it? - No. - Sorry. - Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. - I was just kidding. You guys are gonna have a great Olympic team. (speaking in foreign language) - Work off some of that pasta! Hurry up, don't dent his Ferrari. - Oh Jesus. (speaking in foreign language) - That's the third drop. I wanna see my son. - Wait. Your blinkers, pendejo! (car revving) (speaking in foreign language) - Okay. - You have done very well, my friend. Come back and let's celebrate. (laughing) (shooting) (mocking laugh) - Puto! (shooting) - That's for being stupid. It. Is. Done. On. The. Way. (car revving) (tense atmosphere music) (tracker beeping) What the fuck? (speaking in foreign language) - Whoa! You fucking stink. That's a crazy infection. You're gonna have a hard time getting laid around here. And if I feel like you, I would wanna die. Wait. Are you waiting for daddy? Is that what it is? 'Cause see, I have bad news. He's not coming. You see, he fucked up. So we have to take him down. - Just do it. - You have suffered too much. Now you die. - Stop stop stop stop stop, don't kill him! We may still need him alive! - What are you talking about? You don't fucking come in here talking to me like that! You wanna die too, huh? - His dad. I knew I recognized him, but I just couldn't place it. He's The Butcher. He's part of the Cuban Kills. Responsible for the Madrid Massacre. (chuckling) He's in witness protection. He's connected. - No. He's fucking dead. - Are you absolutely sure? (speaking in foreign language) - [Miguel] Lock him up. - When my dad gets home, you guys are in so much shit. - He's not answering the phone. - Find me Diego. Come on! - He's off grid. - What about Carlos? - So is he. - Fuck. - It's daddy. Are you okay? - Daddy? Yeah, yeah, we're at the cabin, we're fine. Uncle G's-- - Where are you? What is going on? I can't get a hold of Jax. - They took him. - Who took him? - Some very bad people. - What? What? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? - Who took him? Where's Jax? - I'm going to get our son back. - You? - Yeah, I'm going to get him now. - Wait, you're gonna get him back? Oh my god. What? What are you thinking? What are you thinking? No! - A long time ago, before you and me, let's just say things were very different. - What are you talking about? I know everything. - You need to calm down. You don't know everything. - You're gonna bring him home? - [Stone] Yes. - Do you promise? - Yes, I promise you. And you know how I am with promises. - Freely. - I know baby. I'm gonna figure this out. It's all connected somehow. I gotta go honey. Stay there and wait for us to come home. - Are you gonna come home? - Daddy's coming home? (phone ringing) - I wanna come home. I wanna be a family again. - I want you to be careful. I love you. Hey, I love you. - I love you too, baby. - Bye. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be fine. Everything's fine. (ominous atmosphere music) - Baby, you were amazing upstairs. (phone buzzing) - Working late? - You better be butt dialing me. - I missed you too. Glad to hear your voice. Can't believe you still have the same number. - I keep meaning to change it, you know? I thought we had an understanding. - Yup, so you must understand the extreme position I find myself in, Mr. Senator, to be making this call. - What do you need Tony? - It's Spencer, remember? I think you even named me. - What do you need? - I need for our government to protect my son who has been held hostage and is a punching bag to the Matutero Cartel. I think I saw something. - What? You saw what? - Don't know. Military grade weapons. Wait. You knew about that. - I really wish there was something I could do for Jax, but-- - Come on Ben, we go back, we go way back. You used to wet the bed when you'd come over at night. "Benny the Bedwetter." I punched that kid in the face. That maimed you. I broke your nose. We were tight. Come on, I'm in a jam with Jax. You were even at the Christening when he was born. - That was a long time ago. A long time ago. My hands are tied now. It's complicated. I'm retiring. And I really wish there was something I could do. - So that bullet at the restaurant was for me? - Don't ever call here again. - Enjoy your retirement, Senator. Although I hear it's tough looking over your shoulder all the time. - Hey, did you just threaten me? - Oh I most certainly did. I'm coming for you, you worthless piece of shit! You have my word on that! - Tony, I was, Tony? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck him. (ominous atmosphere music) (phone ringing) (speaking in foreign language) - [Stone] Oh did you miss me? - Mr. Spencer. Or is it Antonio Bandez today? (chuckling) I guess you were quite the cook, no? - Yup. I do like to cook. I saw it. - You saw what? - The weapons. I saw them. - Go on. - I'm going to make one offer. Exchange me for Jax. - And why would I do that? - I'll come right now. We'll do the exchange, me for Jax, bada bing bada boom. It's a done deal. - Okay. Okay. I'm gonna have my best snipers on your son's head. Just in case things don't go as planned. How does that sound? - I made a promise. And I always keep my promises. All I want is my son. And I'm on my way. - Oh I can't wait. Motherfucker. Go get him. Andale. - We should have heard something by now. - We will. Try to be patient and relax. - I don't see why I can't text anybody. - Would you stop it? We are all doing the best we can here. - Can we please just go home? I'm going crazy here. - You're impossible. - Relax, honey. Everything will be all right. - What was my dad like? When he was younger. - A real spitfire. Always has been. Your mom had a way of calming him down though. Never seen a man so in love. - How come he and Jax don't talk anymore? - You'd have to ask your mom about that. Your father is... Complicated. He's been through a lot. Your dad's a good man though. And he loves you very much. (tense atmosphere music) (phone ringing) - Hola amigo. I'm running out of fucking patience. Do I have your attention now? (speaking in foreign language) (choking) (shooting) I told you not to fuck with me, pinche pendejo! Vamanos! (suspenseful atmosphere music) (phone ringing) - Hey. I need to talk to you about something. - What have you done? Answer me! - What's the big deal? - What's the big deal? I told you your dad and Jax are in trouble! I told you to stay off social media! - How long are we gonna keep on hiding up here? - Sit down! - I'm going crazy. When are they coming back? - What's going on, what's going on? - Probably nothing. Don't worry. - Come here, right here. - Oh it's done. - You're done! - What? - 14 containers left Guatemala. 13 were delivered to the compound. You do the fucking math! - I don't understand. How can this be? - What it means, mi sobrino, is that you're in trouble. Very huge trouble. I believe that you have awoken a sleeping giant in this "Butcher" Antonio. I'm told that you brought him to the front door of our operation. This is the last time you bring shame to my family! I'm sending Noah in to clean up your fucking mess! Pinche puto! - Mateo. Fucking traitor. You fucking traitor! After all I fucking did for you! You motherfucker! Now you fucking die! (classical Italian atmosphere music) - Nice watch. - Nice ass. I'd like to put a salad forK on that (mumbles). - [Salvie] Hey, minga. Marone, what happened to his hair? - No parent should ever bury a child. Josephine, she's broken up, she can't... She wants me to give you this. Hey, come on. This is my sister's son. What am I gonna do with this clown? Here. She wanted me to give you these. Your grandmother prayed every day with them. May it bring you good fortune. You're gonna be okay. We're here for you. Capiche? - Thanks for coming, all of you. Means a lot to me. - What are you talking about Anthony? You're still funny. Tua famiglia, huh? All right, come on, enough with the hearts and flowers. Let's go wack these wetback cocksuckers. Come on. - Let's wack these pricks out, let's get it. - I'm hungry. Can we get something to eat first? (family squabbling) (jazzy saxophone music) - Wow. You are all grown up. Very nice. - At least one of us has. - Look, I have everything under control. And I told your papa. - Well apparently you weren't convincing enough. And despite my reservations, my grandfather has invested heavily in this operation. But from here on out, there will be no more mistakes. - Mirame. I told them everything was fine. But you. This is no place for women. Entiendes? - Si. But I think I can handle myself. - Muy bien. - Nice to see you too, cousin. ("Ave Maria" piano melody) - Tastes better than it looks too. - It's good. - Okay okay, that should do it. - What the hell? Ain't we gonna say grace? - Fuck grace and the horse she came in on. Mangia. Anthony, you outdid yourself. You're like the Sicilian Julia Child, marone. - I love to cook. It relaxes me. Everybody eat, mangia mangia, come on. - Anthony, you embarrass us. When we're done eating, what do you do? You turn the vacuum cleaner on and you do the dishes? Is that it, huh? (laughing) - I think I just came in my pants, I'm telling you. If I could cook like this, I wouldn't have to pay for pussy anymore. (laughing) - He's never had to pay for pussy once. Not once. - [Rocco] That true? - Yeah, never. Never. - Broads probably pay him. Look at him, he's cut from Michelangelo, you lucky prick. - It's a curse. - Hold up, hold up. Everybody stop! The sauce needs something. - Oh Christ, I thought I was gonna have another heart attack over here. - [Rocco] Which one is that? - Who the fuck counts? My doctor told me I'm gluten intolerant. He told me have soy and tofu, shit like that. - Here's oregano. - I told him Doc, go back to fucking Pakistan. Wherever you're from. - Amen to that. I don't know what the fuck gluten is, but I definitely know I like it. - What is this, The Last Supper over here? - I hope not. At least we all die happy. - Nectar from the gods. Delicious. (clinging glass) - I wanna propose a toast. To our dear friend and brother Anthony. Through the years when our so called "friends" disappointed us, you were here for our family. You are a man of dignity, honor, and respect. And I vow, with my dying breath, that I will bring to justice those that have taken your son. And there's no place I'd rather be than right here with you. Except maybe 25 years ago when we had that threesome in Vegas. (laughing) - You know, I haven't always been that guy. I let my temper get in the way of my life and fuck things up. But there's one thing my pops, Big Tony, God rest his soul, shoved down my throat. I wish he was here with us. My word. And my word is my bond. And I promised Sophie yesterday that I would get our son back. I gave her my word. I'm beyond thankful to have you guys here with me, when all the others bailed, on my promise to bring back my son. To Jax. - [Family] To Jax! - [Don] May he live forever. (speaking in foreign language) - Who loves ya, baby? (laughing) - I miss you so much. - Which is totally half as much as I miss you. - This place is so lame. I wish you could come get me. (ominous atmosphere music) - Carmen's not in her room. Follow me. - I'm just a hop, skip, and an Uber away, my love. Or I can rock my skateboard all the way out there. Carmen? Carmen, do you have me? (shooting) Hello? - Oh my god! It's okay. You're okay, you're okay. We're okay. It'll be okay. (weeping) (phone ringing) - It's Tony. I'm here for my son. I'm going to take him home today or I'll die trying. - Okay. I see. But we tried that yesterday. And from what I remember, it didn't work out for you. - It's a new day. - Muy bien. I was wondering if you would call me. Quite frankly, I was beginning to worry about you. - You should be worried. Very worried. I'm coming for you. You have my word on that as a Catholic. - Oh I see. So you're gonna take down this whole compound. You're gonna take down this whole compound by yourself! Is that what you're telling me? Huh? - Nah. Brought a few of the old buddies from the neighborhood with me. Now it's personal. - Vamanos! (tense atmosphere music) - Rocco! Rocco, come here. Come get us when it's finished. - [Rocco] We got you, boss. - Salvie, go wait in the car. Jesus, it's hot out here. You're killing me. - Let's go wack these cocksuckers. - All right. Come on, I wanna talk to you guys. I just wanna thank you guys for coming out here. It means a lot to me. And I just wanted to say-- - Sorry I'm late. Heard about the big fight. - Where? - It was on Twitter. No, it was on fucking Facebook. No, never mind, I can't quite remember. I was pretty drunk. Anyway, fuck it. I'm not Italian, but I'm trying. I just love your food. And you bet your fucking ass I'm ready to blow shit up. - Where'd he come from? (laughing) (clearing throat) Martin Luther King Jr said it's not where a man stands in a moment of comfort and confidence. But it's where a man stands-- (shooting) What the fuck? (reloading) (epic action music) (shooting) (laughing) (shooting) - Who in their right fucking mind would wanna live out here? - Nah, it's okay out here. You gotta come out for the six months. - If you're a camel maybe. - Not a camel, you gotta put up with that bullshit back east with the snow and the rain. - Yeah, but come on. - This is nice out. (shooting) - Sniper! Watch the roof! (shooting) (music intensifying) - Fuck that. (shooting) - Anyway, you see Jeopardy last night? - I saw Jeopardy. - You watch fucking Jeopardy? - Yeah, I watched Jeopardy, yeah yeah. - I couldn't believe a schoolteacher, she couldn't answer a simple question. The seven fucking New England states. - Can you name the seven New England states? - Of course I can name them. - Well go ahead and name them. You lost already. - All right, well give me a second. Give me a second. (shooting) (epic action music) - Fuck you! (shooting) - Come and get it, motherfucker! (groaning) - Fuck! - You know what to do when you hear a rattlesnake? You see that? - Yeah? - You stand still, you don't move. I know you, you're gonna move. - You don't know. Oh look at this, how convenient. - Take care of that, take care of that, take care of that. (shooting) - (mumbles) you cocksucker. - He down? - Yeah, he's down for the count. - He moving? - What's taking these other pricks so long? (epic action music) (shooting) - Hola, mi amiga. (shooting) Hashtag Me Too. Hashtag fuck you, bitch. Tony, all clear! (tense atmosphere music) (grunting) (neck snapping) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! He's gone. Enough. Let him go. Calm down, enough. - Come on, Anthony. - Come on, come on, let it go. Let it go, come on. - I just wanna see my boy. - I know, I know, come on. - I just wanna talk to my son. - Come on come on come on. - I didn't get a chance to tell him. - Come on come on. Come on, we're done here. Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Listen to me. Listen, he's gone all right? You've been a good father. You did the best you could, okay? - Where's Salvie? He still there? - Salvie didn't make it. He's got cancer and this is the way he wanted to go. He didn't wanna die in a hospital with tubes up his ass. Look how beautiful all this is. We made Salvie's day, all right? We blew the shit out of all these Mexicans. Capiche? Huh? Right fellas, didn't we? Okay. Where you going? Where you going? - I gotta take care of a few things. - No no no no. - I'll catch up with you guys later. - Rocco, go after him, go after him. - No no no no, it's okay. I gotta take care of some things. Don't friggin' worry about it. - All right, come here Rocco. He's good. Let him go, let him go. (tense atmosphere music) - Cocksucking senator. Cheating on his wife? I should kill that fucking slut. - Here's to early retirement. - Hell yeah. (laughing) - [Ben] God bless America. - Die, motherfucker. (dramatic atmosphere music) (knocking) It's open, come in! You didn't have to knock, this is still your home too. - I never really felt at home here. Where's my package? - Relax, Jax. - Don't tell me to relax. Try to order me around like one of your fucking goons. - Hey keep your tone done. Respect me, I'm still your frickin' father. - Respect? For you? You kidding me? - I know we don't see eye to eye. How about you do you and I'll do me? - Yeah. God only knows what you've done in your past. I don't even wanna know. Even though I have access to your Triple I. - What are you gonna do, use that on me? - I don't even know why I pretend to care about you. 'Cause I don't. I'm only here 'cause you and mom are getting a divorce. - Look, I still love her. I just don't get along with your mother. - Don't give me that shit. I'm just here to pick up a package. - I know you're not proud of me, but believe it or not, I'm proud of you. - You got nothing to be proud of. We deserve better, mom deserves better. I honestly hope... That this is the last time I ever see you. - Yeah, I don't think so. Kids today. (dramatic piano music) - And so it is appropriate that we are gathered here today for the celebration of life. For Jax so dearly loved the desert. And as Jax moves on, it is we who are left behind. We are the unfortunate ones. Let us celebrate each day. And each other. For we will all be met again. My sincerest condolences. (epic orchestra music)
