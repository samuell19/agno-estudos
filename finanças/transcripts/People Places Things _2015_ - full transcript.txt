[MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "MOONS AND FLOWERS"] [music playing faintly] Dad, I made this flower for you. Oh, thank you. Exactly what I needed. Hey, don't think about eating that cake yet, Clio, please. - Aw, please? - Thank you. Have you seen your mother? BOTH: No. Well, there, soldier. Watch out. Don't concuss anyone. There you go. Could someone superv-- we need an adult supervisor. Hey, Meanne. Have you seen Charlie anywhere? I don't see anything. [sigh] The party's outside. That's not your cape. I know your parents. I just, I-- I don't think I want to have kids with you. And it's not-- it's not your fault. It's not anything you've done. It's just that I've thought a lot about it, and I don't-- Hey, have you guys seen Charlie? Who's Charlie? H--Have a great pa--party [music playing faintly] Charlie? CHARLIE: Oh, wait! Wait! [RECORD SCRATCHING, MUSIC STOPPING] [nervous chuckle] It's not what you think. I think you've been having sex. OK. It is what you think, but you pushed me into this. I was just looking for the matches. I think I better go. No, stay. I want you to be here. I'd really like to go. Yeah, why don't you go? He's not going anywhere. OK. Well, could he at least put on a shirt? This isn't about him. No, I know. It's about ask, but I would feel more comfortable if he had a shirt on. - Fine. You want him to put a shirt on? There. Is that better? No, of course not. That's much worse. I don't care. Stop looking. What happened? I thought we were happy. You thought we were happy? Well, happiness is not really a sustainable condition. Right? See what I mean? Just take it easy. I'm sure it's really hard for him to process all this so suddenly. Shut up! Hey, man. I'm-- Um, I know that you're upset, but I'm just--I'm trying to help here. I'm going to fight you. Please don't. Don't do that. CLIO: Will-- GARY ST. GRAY: There are children downstairs. Whoa! [will yelling] Oh, my god. No. No. Careful! Will! [grunting] Stop holding me. [gary shh-ing] Get your arms off my arm. - Calm down. Calm down. The kids are ready to-- - OK, take it easy. - Never mind. WILL HENRY: Oh, I want to punch you. GARY ST. GRAY: I'm not going to do that to you. Calm down. [will yelling] On your feet. Relax . Breathe. - Forget it, Will. It's over. WILL HENRY: Ow! What's over? Us. Us? What, just like that? It didn't happen just like that. We have kids. Don't drag them into this. What do you mean, don't drag them into this? They're having a birthday party downstairs. It takes a lot of courage to try and change your life. Ah, yeah. Well, I admire your bravery. Don't be bitter, Will. It doesn't suit you. Don't be bitter? Well, how should I be? I love you. Then what's the problem? The problem is I don't love my life. I'm sorry. (WEAKLY) Oh, you're sorry? (WHISPERING) I'm sorry too. Are ya? Yeah. [music playing] (SINGING) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you two. Happy birthday, Colette and Clio. Happy birthday to-- You. (SINGING) --you. OK, who wants cake? Let's blow it out. OK, there's a tiny, tiny bit for you. I can't believe you guys are six years old. It's like it was yesterday you were five. It was yesterday, Dad. You know what I mean. Uh, who wants presents? (BOTH) Me! OK. I got you iPads! [clio and colette giggling] They're not iPads. CLIO: Run! [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "THEY'RE NOT IPADS"] [clio and colette giggling] [phone ringing] Oh, hey. Hey, Charlie. How are you? Yeah, we're at the park. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): How's it going? Oh, yeah. I made them some kites. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Oh, OK. Yeah, I made them myself. No, m-- No, you know, I--I-- my--myself, I made them. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Oh, uh-- Yeah, they're flying. Well, they're-- they're kind of flying. Yeah. Hey, uh, I hope you don't mind, the girls asked if they could stay a little bit longer. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): OK, um-- OK. Great. Are you sure you don't mind? CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Yeah. OK. Yeah, I'll have them back before bed. Yeah. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): I don't want them eating pizza. OK. Thanks a lot. Hey, girls. Your mum asked if I could keep you guys busy a little longer. Sound OK? Yeah? Oh-- [sigh] [doorbell ringing] Oh, hey. Hey, Gary. Girls. (BOTH) Hey, Gary. [weak chuckle] Uh, I'll get Charlie. Um, (SHOUTING) Charlie! You can go in. You can go in. Hi, girls! Oh, hi. Happy birthday. Oh, my gosh. Those are so cool. Go show Gary your kites. Those are awesome. Have a great week, girls! Does he have to answer the door? He thought you were the Thai food. Not surprising. Um, can I talk to you? Sure. Uh, not now. Tomorrow, noon, Ted & Honey? I'll buy you a cookie. Are you OK? Yeah, noon. Noon's fine. Good night, girls. I love you. CLIO AND COLETTE: Bye, Dad. I love you too. [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "YOU'RE LONELY"] [sigh] Mate, you're lonely. [music playing] [baby fussing] Sorry I'm late. I promised you a cookie. WILL HENRY: I'm fine. - I promised. - It's OK. I promised. Oatmeal chocolate chip. No, I said I was fine. It's your favorite. I'm not-- I'm trying to give up sugar. Take a bite. It's your favorite. I'm trying to-- Just take a bite. Thank you. How's work? Teaching? It's good. Gives me an excuse to put off the book. You should be doing both. I know. I've been getting over a big breakup. I'm well. Thanks for asking. Oh, how are you? I'm taking improv classes. Oh, that's funny. Why is that funny? No, I just mean, isn't it-- is it supposed to be funny, improv? I don't know much about it. There's a lot more to it than just being funny. Oh. Yeah. Gary thinks I have a lot of unexplored talent. Does he? I'm sure you do then. Gary wants to get married. - Well-- - I know. It's crazy. I-- I still don't know how I feel about it. What did you tell him? I don't know. I--I'm still thinking about it. I thought you never wanted to get married? I know. You said it was the surest way to ruin a relationship. Well, not getting married doesn't seem to work either. Are you kidding me? Look, I know this is sudden, but if I'm going to do this I'd really like your support. I thought you were still thinking about it. I am. I am still thinking about it. You're thinking right now about it, like as we speak. I'm pregnant. Oh. Oh, wow. Is it his? Of course, it's his. Just asking. Look, I just want to know there's going to be someone there when I'm old and gross. I was going to be there. Don't. I think I should go. Why? I don't know. Just feels like what I should do right now. Will-- Yeah? Take the cookie. Good. Great. [door creaking open] [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "WHY DOES LIFE SUCK?"] Why does life suck-- double underline-- so hard? Any thoughts? Because people are selfish and petty. I love that passion, but no. It doesn't? No, life sucks because my ex left me for an off Broadway monologist who just knocked her up and asked her to marry him. Now Gary is going to see my daughters more than I do. He's going to live in my old house. He's going to take over my family while I eke out a lonely existence in a studio apartment in Astoria. You been to Astoria? Uh, I think, like, once for a party or something. Yeah, once. What's a monologist? It's like a comedian without the jokes. That's a thing? Yeah, that's a thing. According to the MacArthur Foundation, it's a thing. He's probably monologuing to my daughters right now. I don't get it. Does any of this have to do with the graphic novel? Why are we here? To learn? You're on fire today, Paul. To learn-- to learn what? How to tell a story. Why does anyone need to tell a story in the first place? Because? You did it again. Anyone else? To understand ourselves better. OK, that sounds nice. But if that's the only reason, then why not just go to therapy? Because therapy is stupid. Yeah. Maybe it's stupid. Yeah. Can I go home? Just take-- Let's take a break. Let's take a break. Great comments, guys. Thank you. [chairs screeching] Uh, Mr. Henry? Uh, yeah? Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just having a bad life. It will be over eventually. Um, I don't want this to seem weird or anything, but would you maybe want to come to my place for dinner? Uh, listen, thank you so much-- - Kat. - --Kat. Yeah, Kat. Th- That-- That's a really kind offer, Kat. Uh, but (WHISPERING) we're-- we're not supposed to date students at this school. - No. Oh, my god. No. Oh, this? Yeah, no. Never. Did you think I was asking you out? No. - Oh, my god. - Oh, no. No. Defi-- Definitely not. No, no, no. I-- I would never do that. That is so gross. Wow. I-- Sir, I would never. I would never, ever, ever do that. - OK, I'm not the Elephant Man. - No. No, I know. You're just-- you're so old. Why the hell did you ask me over for dinner for? Because I want you to meet my mom. Oh, y-- your mum? Yeah, a cute mom. How old is your mum? 45. How old do you think I am? Probably-- I don't know, like be-- like between 50 and 62? I'm only 39-- no, I turned 40. I'm a young 40. Well, here she is. Oh, th-- that's your mum? Yeah. And she likes your work too. Oh, th-- that's sweet. Mm-hmm. She's sweet. Listen, Kat, I'm-- I'm still getting over my ex. Look, you should just meet my mom. I promise you won't meet anybody nearly as hot as her in your apartment. OK? God, I hate that apartment. You know what, Kat? What the hell, I'll meet your cute mum. Great. Here's the address. Be there at 8:00. And wear something nice. I-- like this kind of thing? [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "HERE FOR THE DATE'] [door ringing] DIANE: Who is it? - Hey. Uh, it's Will Henry. I'm here for the-- the date. [gate buzzing] [sigh] Gosh, you brought wine. This is just so awkward. Oh, sorry. I didn't re-- realize it would be awkward. Uh, you must be-- Oh, I am Diane, Kat's mom. Oh, well, I am, uh-- Will. Yes, I know, and it's nice to meet you too. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I just wanted to let you know that I'm seeing someone. Oh. Uh, well-- Yeah. You know, Kat doesn't know, which is why she set this up. Truth is, I don't think she'd like the guy. I'm not even sure if I like him, but we've had a couple of dates and I just-- I don't know. I feel as though I should be straightforward with you. I know a lot of people date a lot of people nowadays, and, I don't know, I'm not comfortable with that sort of thing. Yeah. No judgment, of course, if-- if that's what you do. I mean, you could be coming from a date right now for all I know, right? You're not coming from a date right now though, huh? Uh-uh. No. No, don't answer it. Don't answer it. And, as a matter of fact, just forget it. That is none of my business. Hm. But I did hear you recently split up, and I'm sorry. Dating sucks. It does. Erm, well, OK. I guess I'll-- I guess I'll just go home then. Uh, no. You can't go. Why not? Well, Kat's here. All right, listen, I'm unsure about this. It s-- It seems very messy to me. I-- I don't really want to be involved with deceiving a student. Uh, Mr. Henry? Hey, Kat. Hey. What are you guys doing out here? Nothing. Mm-hmm. I, uh, just, uh, am getting to know your teacher. KAT: Tight. Yeah. Very tight. Very tight friends. So how long have you been making comic books? I'm not sure. Um, ever since I was a kid, I suppose. Mm, really? Were your parents encouraging? Oh, not at all. Why not? Not a lot of successful comic book artists where I'm from. Oh, and where are you from? New Zealand. Mm, it's a beautiful place. Oh, you-- you've been to New Zealand? No, but Kat makes me go see all the Hobbit movies, so-- Oh, so you know all about us and our ways. That was sassy. Yeah, I'm a sassy little hobbit. I like it. Now, tell me truthfully, are there any successful comic book writers anywhere? Well, the School of Visual Arts has had its share, yeah. Right, SVA. Do you have a problem with SVA? No. It's just, um-- well, I wanted Kat to go to Columbia. Oh, Columbia's a good school. Columbia is a great school. And what do you do? I teach at Columbia. Oh. Wow. That's, uh-- Wow. Really, wow. What do you teach? American literature. American literature. Early American, pre-comic book. Is, uh-- is that supposed to be a joke? Maybe. So hilarious. You do realize that, uh, comic books are part of American literature, don't you? I don't know if I would necessarily-- Well, how many comic books have you read? Oh, gosh. Including yours? Sure, including mine. Mm, actually I've only read yours. Unbelievable. And this is why people still don't take comics seriously, because the literature department of Columbia University doesn't even recognize it as literature. Listen, I liked your little book. My little book? I liked your comic book. Better? My little comic book? Oh, my god. Are you guys arguing already? Please mind your business, Kat. Mind your business, Kat. [sigh] It's good wine. Would you like some more? Really, no. I actually shouldn't. - Good. Anyway, I might want to take the rest home. Well, uh, thank you. Have a good night. It really was, um, I don't know. It was something. Yes. Thanks for helping with Kat tonight. It was nice meeting you. Yeah. Thank you for the pork cutlets. Delicious. Mm, it was swordfish. (CONFUSED) Oh-- (WITH UNDERSTANDING) Oh. Listen, Kat told me you're kind of really going through something. Believe me, I-- I know how that is. So for what it's worth, I-- I just want you to know that I really do think that you are nice. Thank you. I think you're nice too, I guess. Good night. Yeah. Bye, Kat. KAT: Bye! How'd it go? Mm, he's a bit of a snob. OK, well, you're a bit of a snob, so-- [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "BRICK BY BRICK"] [heavy sigh] Daddy! Daddy! Are you girls ready for the greatest weekend of your lives? You say that every weekend. Yeah. We're doing it again. Come on. There you go. Where did you get this car? I borrowed it from a student. We're going upstate. What for? What do you mean, what for? To get out of the city. Are you in trouble? No, I'm not in trouble. Where would you get a crazy idea like that? What a crazy question. I just thought, uh, you girls spend too much time cooped up in New York. Are we staying in a hotel? Uh, no. I thought we could go camping. Camping? Yeah. Like in a tent? Yeah. Do you own a tent? I do not own a tent, but there is a tent in the car. Momma says to practice cello this weekend. You can practice cello in the woods. [giggling] [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "CAMPING TRIP"] Get back here! [whispering] [will shouting, girls screaming] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go! [splash] [cellos playing] WILL HENRY: Ow. Sounds beautiful, girls. That sounds amazing. What song is that? [groan] It's OK. I'll sleep outside, under the stars. It'll be romantic. It's fine. Don't worry. [cellos playing] [fire crackling] So how are you guys? Fine. Yeah? How's your mum? She's a pain. Did she tell you about her-- Yeah. And how are you feeling about everything? I don't know. How are you feeling? I don't know. Good. Fine. You guys know I'll always be your dad, right? Yeah? Are you going to the wedding? I'm not sure that's such a good idea. Dad, do you hate mom? Of course not, Clio. Colette says you hate her. I love your mother. Does she love you? Yeah. I think, you know, in a way, yeah. Sure. Yeah, she does. Then why is she marrying Gary? Love is complicated, girls. Mom's a bitch! Hey, Collette! I'm telling mom you said that. Go ahead and you're a bitch too. Girls, listen. Stop. OK? It's really important we give your mum our support right now. You understand? Why? Because she needs it. Don't-- I know you're trying to knock my hot dog off into the fire. You want me to starve. [clio and colette giggling] OK, good night, girls. I love you. - Love you too, Dad. Love you too, Dad. [crickets chirping] CLIO: Dad? Yeah. CLIO: Are you seeing anyone No, honey. CLIO: Good. [doorbell ringing] [doorbell dinging] [heavy knocking] [phone buzzing] [grunting and growling] INSTRUCTOR: Time. (BOTH) Rhinoceros? Oh, yeah! Oh, my god. [door opening and closing] Hi. (WHISPERING) Hey. How did you get in here? I texted you. You said you could keep them tonight. Yeah, sure. That's fine. I can keep them. I meant at your place. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I want more time with them. What? Where's this coming from? I need to see them more. I want some weekdays. You live in Astoria. So what? So that's an hour and a half commute to school every day. I can can move closer. Since when can you afford to move closer? I'm a good father. You're good at having fun with them. They're six years old. They should always be having fun. They should be learning things. Did they practice their cellos this weekend? Yes. They need to practice that every day. I want more time with them. [sigh] Look, can we talk about this tomorrow? I'm tired. Where's, uh, Gary, the monologist? He's at his apartment. He has an apartment? Yeah. He keeps it as a workspace. Why, do you think that's weird? [will gulping] It is. Yeah, it is. Shit. What am I getting into? Don't answer that. [click] WILL HENRY: What is happening here? Uh, An eye is blinking. Why do you say that, Paul? Because that's what's happening. Do you see any eye actually blinking in either of these two images? Well, no. No. You see an eye open, then the next image we see an eye closed. And we create the blink in our minds, and this is called closure. What's it called? Closure. - What's it called. - (COMBINED) Closure. Yeah. So respect that gap between your panels. It could do a lot of work for you. It can travel time and space. It can create and destroy whole worlds. Ka-boom! [class chuckles] In some way, that little gap between the panels is just as important as the images in the panels themselves, because there is the story you're telling and then there are the things that you're leaving out. And in that way, the story becomes a shared creation between the writer, you guys in the future, and the reader. I don't get it. What's supposed to be happening here. It's not always as simple as a blink. I don't know. It just seems random. (UNDER BREATH) You seem random. OK, that's enough for today. I want sketches for your memory pieces next week-- everyone. No exceptions-- Celia, (UNDER BREATH) Paul. [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "BRICK BY BRICK"] [door ringing] Oh, hey. Hey. I've been thinking-- Hey, girls. Yeah? Wh-- What are you doing here? You said you wanted more time with the girls-- Yeah. Let's give it a try. What, right now? Yeah. Are you busy? Well, I was kind of-- I was kind of working on a thing. OK. So you can't take them? No, of-- Yeah, of course, I can take them. Yeah. Come in. Come in, girls. Uh, I could have used a little notice. I don't even have any groceries. You said you wanted more time with them. I've only got one egg. Figure something out. Go to the store. [exhaling] What's-- what's going on? Why are you here? - Meanne quit. - She quit? Yeah. Why did she quit? She got a job with Jon Stewart. What, Jon S-- the Jon Stewart? Whoa, really? What's she doing? Sketches or-- No, not sketches. Watching his kids. What do you think? Oh. Oh, yeah. Of course. They during my improv showcase. [will chuckling] Oh, that's not-- Oh, yeah. That's not funny, so-- - Yeah. It's terrible timing. Gary's doing this new monologue and his family's in town for it. It's just kind of awful. Which, the monologue or the family? The combination? God, I'm just-- I'm so pissed at Meanne. The girls must be sad. She's been around since they were babies. OK. Here's their schedule for the rest of the week. Make sure they practice their cello for at least 20 minutes a day. No problem. And cook them vegetables. I don't want them eating pizza. Bye, girls! CLIO AND COLETTE: Bye, Mom. I love you. (BOTH) Love you too. All right, call me. CLIO: OK. COLETTE: OK. Are you guys hungry? Bath and bed straight after dinner, OK? We're going to have to wake up super early to make it to school on time. - How early? - 6:00 AM. 6:00 AM? Are you kidding me? [will blowing] No, I'm serious. We've never woken up that early in our life! You're going to tomorrow. No, we're not. Pardon? No, we're not. Yes, you are. Do you want to bet? I'm not going to bet you. Have you ever woken up that early? OK, 6:45, but we're going to have to move really fast. I don't want to be late. Stop the look. Don't give each other secret looks. [clio and colette giggling] CLIO: Uh, Dad? (VOICE DISTORTED) Uh, Dad? [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "LATE TO SCHOOL"] COLETTE: Dad? (VOICE DISTORTED) Dad? Wake up! (VOICE DISTORTED) Wake up! - Shit. Shit. You shouldn't say shit. (VOICE DISTORTED) You shouldn't say shit. Stop playing with my phone and get dressed. (VOICE DISTORTED) Stop playing with my phone and get dressed. Are you guys OK with pizza for breakfast? Don't answer that. I have to poop-- [phone ringing] --really bad. OK. Just wait. Just wait a little-- W-- Hey, Charlie. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): You're late. Yeah. We're al-- almost there. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): I can't believe you. Did you set your alarm? No, I did set my alarm. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): No, you didn't set your alarm. Of course, you didn't set your alarm or you would be here by now. - Yeah. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Why don't you use an alarm-- No, I set-- CHARLIE (ON PHONE): --to get here when [inaudible].. But-- CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Like, is it impossible for you to [inaudible]. - --I set my-- I set my alarm. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Could you not interrupt me. I'm trying to-- - I set my alarm. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): What did they have for breakfast? Did they have breakfast? Yeah, they're having breakfast. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): What are they eating? Are they eating pizza? Uh, y-- you know, some cheese and-- CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Huh? - --tomatoes. OK! CHARLIE (ON PHONE): [inaudible]. You are so irresponsible. - OK. I'll-- I'll call you when they get to school, all right? OK. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): [inaudible]. OK, OK. I'm sorry. OK, bye. Mom says good morning. [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "LATE TO SCHOOL"] Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Let's take a look at you. You look wonderful. Have a great day. (WHISPERING) Yeah, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. So what did you guys do at school today? I don't know, kid stuff. Just kid stuff? I just did grown up stuff. CLIO: What kind of grown up stuff? You know, like just walking around, doing a job, talking in a serious voice. Like this, (DEAD PAN) "Hello." What did you do today? Same as her. - What? - Kid stuff. Kid stuff? Just kid stuff. Is that all the information I'm going to get out of you? Yeah. Yeah. [phone ringing] Hold on. Uh-oh. Hey, Charlie. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Hey. Can I call you back later? We're just in the middle of this supper. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): You missed the girls' French lesson. I thought it was on Tuesday. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): It is Tuesday, Will. Oh-- CHARLIE (ON PHONE): It's Tuesday. Today is Tuesday. --right. Well, I didn't realize it was Tuesday. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Are you fucking kidding me? OK. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): It's Tuesday, Will. It's Tuesday. Always Tuesday-- Yeah, I know. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): --because Sunday-- OK. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): --fucking Tuesday-- Hey! That's where some of the-- That's why the kids have picked up some bad language. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Look, can you do this? I can do it. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Can I count on you? I can do this. They're eating vegetables right now. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): --on time tomorrow? Yes, they'll be at school on time tomorrow. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Fine. - All right, OK. OK, see you. Bye, bye. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Bye. Girls, you could have told me you had your French lesson today. Merde. Hey, that's a bad word in France! [sigh] Look, ladies-- we're all on the same team here. I can use a little help, especially if you want to spend more time with me. OK? OK. [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "BOMB THREAT"] Wake up. Wake up. It's 6:00 AM. Are you crazy? I'm not crazy. Come on. --but even if they have the popcorn. I don't know if the animals should be eating popcorn. Yeah. What happened? Bomb threats. A bomb threat? How long do we have to wait? School canceled. It can't be canceled. I have to teach today. [sighing] [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "LATE TO SCHOOL"] [door ringing] KAT (ON INTERCOM): What? Hey, it's, uh, Will Henry, your teacher. Look, can we talk for a second? [gate buzzing] Here. Come on. What are you doing here? I need someone to look after my girls. You want-- You want me to babysit your kids? I'm sorry. I don't have anyone else to call on such short notice. Charlie got all our friends when we spit. Please, I'm desperate. I've got a class in an hour. Yeah, I know. I'm in that class. Well, I'll-- I'll excuse your absence. Really? That's unbelievable. I--I can pay you. Do they watch TV? They love TV. Right, girls? You like TV, right? Come on! Yeah. OK, fine. Whatever. - Thank you so much. - Sure. What is this? These are, uh, just a couple of cellos. A couple of cellos? Are they supposed to play this right now? No. No, of course not. OK, girls, this is Kat. What's up? That means hello. Come on. Y'all carryin' your own cellos. All right, memory pieces-- who wants to share theirs first? Tom. Yeah. Hi. I decided to write about how I learned to masturbate. I was 12. So one day, I walked into my dad's office where he kept all of his dirty magazines, and, uh, I found some lotion. And-- You have a lot of nerve, do you know that? Is this because I didn't call you? Because I thought you were dating someone. - No. - I also-- No. --wasn't sure if the chemistry-- What are you even talking about? This has nothing to do with us. What's this to do with then? This is about the fact that you asked my daughter to skip your class so that she could babysit your kids. I'm sorry. I was in a desperate situation this morning. But you didn't think to ask any of your male students for help. - Are you kidding? My male students are idiots. Oh, so the idiots get to go to class while the bright girl stays at home and takes care of your kids? What kind of message does that send to Kat or to your daughters, for that matter? I'm sorry. I just didn't think. I-- - Yeah. Well, guys never do. Is she here? She went out after she put your girls to bed. They're asleep? It's only 7 o'clock. They were exhausted. What are you doing to them? I just wanted more time with them. Go inside. Look, it's-- it's none of my business, but it just seems to me like you and your ex are a little loose about all of this. I mean, they're children. You can't just pass them back and forth like puppies. Yeah, I know. Why not-- why not? They need structure, stability. They get that most of the time. Look, it's pretty simple. In this kind of situation, a child just wants to know where they're going to sleep at night. You shouldn't change that on a whim. Yeah. Our kids are so screwed. No. Believe me, I've made just about every mistake there is to make. And if it's any consolation, Kat made it through intact, more or less. Hey, Kat's a great kid. Yeah, she is. She really admires you. She does? Why? She thinks you're a great teacher. Not counting today maybe. No, minus today. Wow, that's-- that's really nice to hear. I think she was a little disappointed when we didn't hit it off. Yeah. Ah, well, we should get going. What? You're not leaving. Your girls are still sleeping. Yeah, we can't stay here. Sure, you can. I don't know. I do, and I'm not letting you drag them back to Astoria in the middle of the night. What is that, a $40 cab ride? I was going to take the subway. [diane sighing] Come on. I'm going to get you some blankets for the couch. I can probably find you some pajamas in there too. Oh, no. That's OK. I can just sleep in, uh, (SCUFFING SHOE) my clothes. I see you've been doing some reading. Oh, yeah. I felt bad after our whatever it was, and I thought I should at least see what you were talking about. So what did you think? I think that you were right. Comic books are an under-appreciated part of American literature. Really? Yeah. I had no idea what people were doing in the form. I mean, there's some really complex, emotionally wrenching stuff going on there. What? That's-- That's amazing. I-- I'm so surprised to hear you say that. (EXHALING) Actually, I-- I need to thank you. What for? Well, I have a new appreciation for what Kat wants to do with her life. I can't believe I was being so dismissive. I really am turning into my mother. Well, that's wonderful. Not that you were turning into your mother. I mean that you would-- you know what I mean. - Oh, yeah. I do. I get it. I, uh-- Uh, so, uh, you still seeing that guy, the one you weren't sure if you liked? Oh, no. No. No. I broke it off after our dinner. Just, uh-- Yeah. Oh. [sighing] Oh, I have your blankets. Oh, thanks. Holding these. [nervous laugh] Got you the soft ones that I had so you could be comfortable out there. Th-- These are really nice blankets. It's no problem. Are you OK with me standing this close? Yeah. I like it, actually. Is this OK here? Oh, this is-- This is good. I like it here. We probably shouldn't be doing this. No. We probably. OK, let's stop. OK, let's stop. Oh, let's stop. (MUFFLED) I'm going to stop soon. (WEAKLY) Stop. Mm, you smell so good. OK. Listen, we have to be quiet. I don't want to wake up the kids. (WHISPERING) Yeah. OK, I'm going to be so quiet. Mm-hmm. But not too quiet. I like to be affirmed. (WHISPERING) OK, I'll be whispering affirmations. I have to tell you. Is something wrong? No. I just, uh-- I want to just say no bullshit, OK? Oh, yeah. No. I mean, I, uh-- I'm a big girl and I don't need this to be anything more than what it is. But just don't bullshit me? I, uh-- Do you understand I've been through enough. Yeah. I understand. I've been hurt too. I know. I could tell the minute we met. It's actually one of the first things I liked about you. That's funny. Do you know what the first things I liked about you was? What? Your tits. That's so nice. Please touch them. [moaning and laughing] CLIO: Daddy? Oh, no. No. Oh, you have to go get her. CLIO: Daddy, are you here? No, no, no, no, no. OK. I'm uh-- I'm going to be right back. OK. I'll be here. [sigh] Hey. Where were you? I was, uh, just getting some blankets from Kat's mom. She's invited us all to have a sleepover tonight. Isn't that fun? Where are the blankets? Let's, uh-- Let's, uh, get you back to bed. Where are you going? Just stretching. [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "ASLEEP WITH THE GIRLS"] Well, this is wildly inappropriate. Oh. Hey, Kat. Hi, good morning. Where have you been all night? What? None of your business. Is your, uh-- is your mum up? Actually, no. She just left for work. But she did tell me to tell you goodbye. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. How did she say it? (FLATLY) Tell him I said bye. Do you know where my children are? Yeah. They're in the kitchen eating breakfast. OK, good. Good. Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday. Yeah. Nah, it's fine. I actually, like, really like your kids though. They are very, very, very fun. Yeah. Thank you. Uh, I want to make it up to you. How does $20 sound? Sounds like you don't know how much to pay a babysitter. How much, uh-- How much would you like? $350. $350? KAT: Yeah. Could you give me a month? Um, you know, you c-- do you think you could just read this, please, if you have time? What is this? It's like a story I've been working on for, like, forever. WILL HENRY: Uh-huh. Um, I don't know, actually. It's pretty dumb. It's not, like, really finished so, like-- No, I would-- No, I would love to read it. No, I'll take it. Not, it's fine. I'll take it. I-- I-- I would love to read it. You would? Sure. It would be my pleasure. Thank you. Um, now get out of my room. Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah. And take the sheets with you please. Burn them. Dad? Why did we sleep at Kat's last night? Mm, because, uh, you guys fell asleep and I didn't want to wake you. - Do you like her? - Who, Kat? Of course, I do. I like all my students. Are you going to marry her? No. She's only 19. So I'm not going to marry her. OK, have a great day, girls. Hey, what's wrong? What did I do? We don't want you to marry Kat. I'm not going to marry Kat. I miss mommy. Oh, my god. Come here. [music - mark orton, "up notes"] It's OK. [doorbell ringing] Hi. Was it today? No, I'm in a fitting. Oh-- What are you doing here? Can we-- Can we talk? Yeah. Are you going to sit? I can't sit in this. OK, well, you look r--r-- really good. Oh. I-- I don't know. I-- I'm going to be showing so much by this wedding, I feel like I should wear something that reveals more leg, kind of distract from the belly. So you wanted to talk to me about something? Yeah. I-- I just think that the kids are very confused. Why? What have you been doing to them? I haven't been doing anything to them. They weren't confused when I dropped them off at your place. No, I'm not sure that's true. What do you mean? I just think the girls are struggling a little with all of the changes that are going on at the moment. Which changes? Like, you know, like all of the changes. Are you seeing someone? W-- What? Oh, my god. You're seeing someone. Oh, well, I wouldn't-- I wouldn't say we're seeing each other. Unbelievable. I can't believe you picked the one week I give you the girls to start seeing someone. I thought you wanted me to date. How old is she? I hope she's not a student. She's not a student. She's a student's mother. Wow. Where were the girls when you were with her? They were sleeping in her daughter's bed, the dau-- the student. Oh, right. OK. No wonder they're confused. Well, but-- Yeah, that sounds bad, but it's not like that. No, it's-- it's fine. I-- I love that you're seeing somebody. I think that's awesome. I'm not seeing-- Look, this isn't about me or you. I just want the kids to be happy. I thought happiness was not a sustainable condition. You're absolutely correct. It's not. But I don't think they need to live in chaos. There is nothing chaotic about the world I provide for my girls. You left their father on their fifth birthday. Now you're marrying the guy who broke us up. Their nanny left them. Have you told them? OK. You haven't told them. I don't want to hear this. Good night. Have you? Have you told them? Have you t-- you haven't told-- - Stop. --them yet? You drop them off at my place on a whim. I think their lives are pretty fucking chaotic. - Here. - What is this? The girls' schedule-- French, cello, tap, museum Mondays, alternate cooking play date with the Shelton girls every Thursday afternoon, oral storytelling workshop for spring break. Then there's breakfast and dinner everyday, cello practice everyday, reading them to sleep for an hour every day. Don't tell me their lives are chaotic. Well, I'm glad you feed them regularly. I'm not implying that you're a bad mother. I'm a great fucking mother. I know you are. Their lives have never been chaotic with me. It's my life that's been chaotic, because I was unhappy for years and didn't do anything about it. Because first I was taking care of you, and then I was taking care of them, (RAISING VOICE) and no one was ever taking care of me. Well, I'm sorry I didn't know you wanted to take improv classes. Fuck you. Charlie-- I could be so much more than what I am. What does that mean? I don't even know what that means. Of course, you don't (SCOFFING) Of course, you don't. God, I can't believe you're dating a student's mother. We're not dating. Do you like her? I told you, I barely know her. I think you like her. [music - mark orton, "texting"] [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating] Dad, who are you texting? No one. Is it Kat? No, it's not Kat. [sighing] This is a really nice office. Yeah. I thought you would like it. I do. I actually do. I mean, I'm not that-- I'm not using it as a euphemism. I do like your office, really. And I believed you. I didn't receive it negatively. Can I ask you something? Anything. What happened with you and your-- My baby mama? Please don't ever say "baby mama" again. My baby mama. [diane laughing] Don't. You said it-- She's my baby mama. That's three times. I don't know. You don't know? We were always very different. And it was really fun at first, and then gradually less and less fun as it went on. Different, how? Lots of ways. She was outgoing, I was quiet. Mm. WILL HENRY: She had money and I didn't. Mm, that's a big one. It wasn't that. Charlie was always generous with what she had. She actually gave up everything so that I could concentrate on my comics. She had so much confidence in me, probably more than I had in myself at that time. So what went wrong? I guess she just stopped talking, and I enjoyed the silence too much. What happened with you and your ex? Well, it's not that interesting. He was just a fucking asshole. Who can tell me what this is? A pipe. Hasn't anyone here ever taken an art history class? All right, does anyone speak French? Is it a French pipe. It's "The Treasury of Images" by Magritte. Those words say, "This is not a pipe," in French. Correct. "Ceci n'est pas une pipe." That's confusing. Well, the truth is that it's not a pipe. Then what is it? It's only a picture of a pipe. Well, actually, it's a projection of a picture of a pipe. OK, slow down. We don't need to get that meta. I'm just using it to get at the relationship between words and images. Sometimes the graphic storyteller will use words simply to describe what we're seeing. Other times, he will use them to say the opposite of what we're seeing. Is this a happy man? If he's happy, why does he look so miserable? Maybe misery is inexorably linked to happiness. Is this what the writer's trying to say? Who the hell knows. I just know that I'm interested. I'm involved. Isn't that you? It looks like you. Picture of m-- let's go back to this. I'm really confused. And yet we're just starting to explore the possibilities of this. Wh-- PAUL: Huh? [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "WHAT ARE WE MAKING HERE?"] [phone ringing] Hey. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): You have to get here now. OK, calm down. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): This is an emergency. Calm down. CHARLIE (ON PHONE): I need your help. OK. I'm going to be right over. All right? Calm down. [door opening and closing] Charlie? You're here. What's the problem? The girls locked themselves in the bathroom. What? Why? Colette said she wanted to live with you. Just Colette? What about Clio? Did Clio-- Wow, what did you-- what did you tell them? (VOICE BREAKING) I don't want the girls to leave me. I-- I put my whole life into who they are. I don't even know who I am without them. And improv is really, really hard. I-- maybe they should stay with you. I'm such a mess. Hey, it's OK. It's OK. The girls aren't going to leave either one of us. This is your fault. Uh, how is it my-- how is it my fault? You make them kites. You take them camping. You show more initiative now than you ever showed in our relationship. I don't no. I guess I just get comfortable with you taking the lead. Yeah. Well, I never wanted to be the leader. WILL HENRY: I'm sorry. You're sorry? Jesus, Charlie! What do you want from me? We made mistakes. You're getting married. He's having doubts. Who? Gary? Why? I mentioned your girlfriend. She's not-- what's it-- what's she got to do with anything? Gary thinks I'm jealous. Of Diane? That's ri-- That's ridiculous. He thinks I have unresolved issues. Everyone's got unresolved issues. He thinks I have unresolved issues with you. Well, what did you tell him? Maybe you're right. Maybe happiness is not a sustainable condition. Maybe I didn't know what I had when I had it. I don't know. I'm just feeling very confused. Hey, it's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Everything is going to be OK. How do you know? I don't, but it just helps sometimes to say that. I think I miss you. Oh, Charlie-- Do you ever think about me? All the time. Dad? What are you doing here? Who wants ice cream? I do. - Can we have some sprinkles? - You can get whatever you want. You can get whatever you want. We should talk. Yeah. Oh, shit. What's he doing here? - Talk later? - Yeah, sure. I guess. OK. [will sighing] I thought you wanted ice cream? I do want ice cream. [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "GARY WITH FLOWERS"] [phone vibrating] [door ringing] DIANE (ON INTERCOM): Who is it? It's Will. [gate buzzing] Shh, we have to be quiet. Kat fell asleep on the couch. Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch with you all day. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Is something wrong with your phone? We need to talk. Oh, shit. Yeah. Well, what is it? I-- I kissed Charlie. Oh. I'm sorry. You said no bullshit. Yeah. No, I meant, like, don't fuck me if you still have feelings for your ex, but I appreciate your candor. I didn't plan for any of this to happen. So you do still have feelings for her? I don't know. I-- You've been through all this before. Do they ever go away? Are you really asking me that? I'm sorry. I'm confused. Yeah, I can see that. [sigh] I didn't mean to hurt you. No, I know. You're a good guy. Don't say that. Well, what do you want me to say? I-- I don't know. Shouldn't you get mad? Slap me or something. [slap] Ow. Ow. You told me to do it. But I said "or-- or something." I didn't hear that part. Do you want some ice? No. I'm going to let it sting. [exhale] They do go away, you know? When? [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "SO YOU DO STILL HAVE FEELINGS"] Good luck, Will. It was nice while it lasted. Diane-- I really do like you. You didn't even get a chance to know me. [kids laughing] Oh, you're it! [kids screaming] I'm going to go talk to Daddy. OK, girls? - OK. - OK. Thanks. So, uh, I told Diane-- the student's mum about our kiss. Really? I thought you two weren't even dating. We're definitely not now. I'm sorry. [sigh] Yeah. Well, it's whatever. How are you? I'm OK. Yeah? Did you talk to Gary? Yeah, actually, I did. [exhaling] How'd that go? Good. Good. I-- I think we were able to work through most of his doubts. Hm? Did you tell him about the kiss? I didn't tell him about it. What? - Why would I tell him that? - Why not? Why didn't you? It was just a kiss, Will. It was more than just a kiss. Maybe. I'm still marrying Gary. I can't believe you. I-- I just entered the first adult relationship I've had in a year over that kiss. No one told you to do that. You're about to commit to this guy for the rest of your life, possibly. Don't you think you should be honest with him? Hey, look, I'm sorry you're confused about our kiss. I'm not confused. You're confused. OK, you're right. I'm confused. You see? I-- I knew it. I'm having his baby, Will. What about our babies? [clio and colette giggling] CHARLIE: They're not babies anymore. You should tell Gary about our kiss. He deserves to know. Since when do you care about Gary? I don't. I care about you. Then let this go. Unbelievable. Where are you going? What do you care? You're not going to tell him, are you? Oh, yeah. We're best buddies. I'm going to have a sleepover with him in his apartment. Ah, f-- [music - mark orton, "graffiti"] [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "KAT'S BOOK"] [bell jingling] (WHISPERING) Kat, hey. What are you doing here? Uh, came to visit you. How did you find out where I was? Called your mother. Oh, really? I am surprised she answered. Yeah, no. She-- She didn't answer. She refused my call and then she texted me. Mm. And I texted back and she texted me where you were. I know how texts work. I'm sorry. Yeah. No. It's fine. Things don't work out. Happens all the time. I already knew that. I just thought that you would be at least nice to her, at least. I read your book. It's really great. Is it about your mother? I thought this was not a pipe, remember? Yeah. You're right. It's not a pipe. It's a great story though. You think? Yeah, I do. I really do. Thank you. Have you shown any of it to your mother? No. She wouldn't get it. I don't think you're giving her enough credit. No, she'd think I'm exploiting all of her terrible life decisions. Well, uh, to be honest, her character is a bit of a mess but it feels very real, and she's very lovingly portrayed. I think she would be really proud to see the book. The pictures are beautiful. Look, why did you have to turn out to be such an asshole? I don't mean to hurt anyone. Yeah. So what? Are you going to get back with your ex? I don't know what's going on. Do you want to know the best part about my parents splitting up? Yes, please tell me. They split up. That is a beautiful story. Thank you. It's my life, so-- What is this? It is a giant magical book that takes you into a slightly depressing, but hopefully amusing world. What, you want me to read this? Yeah. Holy crap. Are these original drawings? Let me know what you think, OK? Uh, yeah. OK. See ya. [bell jingling] [door shutting] [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "I HAVE SOME NOTES"] [door ringing] I have some notes. What do you mean, notes? You need an ending. How do-- How do you know where I live? What? Dude, come on, I'm 19. I know everything about everything. So are you going to let me in or what? So what's this guy going to do? Which guy? This guy. I don-- I don't know. What do you think he should do? Move on with his life. I think he i--is trying to. Is he? Because he seems kind of stuck. Stuck in what? It's the middle of the day and you're still wearing your pajamas. These are golf pants. I'm-- They're so ugly. --working. Can I see? It's not really-- Those are just things that I painstakingly drew out of anger. You gotta let her go. Let who go? The person you keep drawing. I don-- I don't know what we're talking about now. Yes, you do. So you don't like the book? No, I love the book but I especially like this character-- a lot. Yeah, thank you. I like that character, as well. Mm. You know, I showed it to her. - Why would you do that? - I live with her. It's a big book. She has a few notes. They're very good. Maybe you should call her up and talk to her. I'm not going to call her. Why not? Because she told me not to call her again. Then call her anyway. But she had-- only had one rule, don't call her. Look, call her. Who cares? Just call her or, like, don't call her. Just do something-- anything. Otherwise, what is the whole point of this thing? This place is gross. [music playing] Hi. WEDDING PLANNER: Please don't touch the flowers, sir. Oh, no. I wasn't. I was just-- The flowers are looking, not touching. Oh. This is a private event. Yeah, I'm invited. Bride or groom? I'm neither. Are you here for the bride or groom? I'm was just-- (COMBINED) Daddy! I'm with these guys. Hey. What are you doing here? Mommy didn't think you were coming. Do you know where mum is? I kind of need to talk to her. Is everything OK? Uh-- Are we still going to have to play the cello? Hold that thought. [clearing throat] Oh. Hey, uh, it's you. Hey, Gary. I didn't think you were coming. I need to-- I need to tell you something. Oh, boy. Yeah? I, uh-- I'm going to punch you. Oh. No, I, uh-- I understand and I think you should. I don't care what you think. Stop nodding. Right, sorry. Oh, I just did it again. Um, what should I-- would should I do? You could either fight back or you could close your eyes. I th-- I think I choose closing my eyes. I'm just-- please don't hit me in the face. I'll punch you wherever I like. That's fair. Stop agreeing with me. Sorry. You're right. Just whenever you're-- oh! Jesus! Ow. (SCREAMING) Ow! Are you-- Are you OK, Gary? No. That was my ear, man. - I know. Well, you said not the face so I didn't know-- - God damn it. - It wasn't-- The ear is the face! I don't think of the ear as the part of-- The ear is part of the face. I don't think of it as part of the face. Well, that's not true. That's definitely not true. The ear is part of the face. I think the face is this oval here. That's what I teach in drawing class. OK. I-- I don't think so. That's not the way I was taught, but-- Should we agree to disagree? Sure, agree to disagree. [groan] That was-- That was a good hit, man. Thank you. My hand really hurts from your ear, so if that's any consolation. Well, do you know where she is? Nobody-- nobody can find her. She's not answering her phone. Are you serious? - Why would I kid about that? - Well, I don't know. I don't know you. I don't know your sense of humor. I'm not kidding. Ow. Ow. Well, hey! I love her, you know? Yeah, I know now. You came. I came. Your pants are too short. Yeah, I just got them. You look good. There are people looking for you. But only you know where to find me. It kind of helped that you texted me where you were. What are you doing? I'm afraid I'm making another mistake. I don't think of what we did as a mistake. It didn't work out. It did, and then it didn't. CHARLIE: What does that mean? (SIGHING) It means we can't predict what's going to happen or how we're going to change. [music - mark orton, "parents"] I love you. I love you too. But if you wait any longer, you're going to miss your wedding. Are we friends? We're more than that. What are we? We're parents. [cellos playing] CLIO: OK, you first. COLETTE: No, you first. [cellos continue] [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "YELLOW ROSES"] [MUSIC - MARK ORTON, "MOONS AND FLOWERS"]
