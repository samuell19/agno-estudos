(grunting) (bright guitar music) (heavy breathing) (laughs) (bright guitar music continues) (heavy breathing) (phone ringing) - Shit. Sorry I must have fallen asleep. I don't know why those girls would take a sofa. You're right, they were crazy. Hey I'm really sorry there was ah... what are you doing here? - I'm here because I care about you, that's why we're all here. - Is this about the sofa? - It's about everything Gabriel, it's setting stuff on fire, driving around in a hearse, frittering away the money that mom left you to play in this group. I mean have you ever paid rent? - Yeah I was gonna pay it back. - It's alright man, this isn't any of your business. Alright it's my money. - Do you ever wonder what happened to your friends, your girlfriend? - I don't have time for girlfriends, and these are my friends, Alice, and we're gonna be big. Alright? We're gonna be huge. - Shut up will yah, both of yah. This meeting is happening because you're out of control. - Rock and roll is supposed to be out of control Pearse, I mean, why do you think she keeps coming to our gigs? - For the last time Nevo is not coming to our gigs. There's no pop stars coming to our gigs. You're a good drummer man. - Yeah thanks. - There's plenty of other good drummers out there. You need to get your act together right now. - You just need to maybe cut back on the booze and spliff. - That is not what we agreed. - [Toss] He deserves a chance. - Are you both deluded too? - We all know he needs to clean up his act and he will, won't you man? - He's sick for Christ sake.

I've kids of my own now, they're my priority. - I know. (Door opens) - Alice. - Thank you so much for seeing us. - Gabriel, now let's do this the right way huh. - Are there side effects? - [Dr. Flahavan] There are side effects with most medications, hopefully your brother's won't be too severe. - How long will I be on these for? - Well let's see how you react, you may need to switch your dosage or change you to something else. - I mean on anything? - Oh I imagine you'll be on some form of medication for the rest of your life. It's not such a big deal, lots of people are for one thing or another. I mean I take medication myself every day, blood pressure, that's what runs in my family. Luck of the draw. I'm also gonna recommend that you take part in a mixed ability football game, it's set up by a former colleague of mine, Eric Vasser. - Football? - Physical exercise would be so therapeutic for you. Plus it may help combat any side effects you may experience. Your mother once told me you used to be quite a handy player. (players shouting) - [Eric] Nice and easy now. Nice touch, good touch Shawn. Yeah trap and tap, trap and tap. - [Gabriel] Eric? - Gabriel right? - Yeah. - Remind me why you're here again? - Just been over indulging a bit. - Bipolar with psychotic and delusional episodes it says here. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Grab a blue bib let's get you sweating. (gentle guitar music) [Eric] Well done Robert, nice touch, that's it yeah, nice and gentle. Yeah nice one guys. Nice and soft. Yeah, keep the ball down, keep the ball down. Yeah right to your partners foot, good stuff. Okay let's get this match started. (whistle blowing) Keep the energy levels up. Well done Christopher. [Eric] Wonderful. Great save, well played. Yeah don't mark the man, mark the ball. - I was in control of the ball. - What are you doing, you could have broken my leg, I'm a drummer. - Accidents happen some times in football. You're not allowed to touch me. - Oh but you're allowed to break my leg? - [Eric] Lads. - You're not allowed to touch me I said. - Hey, say you're sorry for hurting him. - I'm not saying sorry to that freak. - Well then get out. Go on you're not welcome. - Fine, you're all shit anyway. - He had no right to do that to yah. - [Christopher] I was in control of the ball. - You okay about what happened today with that new guy? - Well he doesn't understand the rules. - No that's right, he didn't understand them at all. (car engine revving) (knocking on door) - We're gonna be late for rehearsal. (knocking on door) [Toss] You look wrecked man. - Just give me a hand will yah. - If this is what clean living looks like, remind me never to try it. (upbeat rock music) (gentle snoring) - I really don't know what to tell you Gabriel. Yes I do have colleagues who believe that intensive counseling and therapy can be an effective alternative to medication for some clients. I also have colleagues who prescribe yoga, but in your particular case any regime other then the clinically proven route we've agreed would be a huge gamble. - I can't play drums like this, I'm gonna have to stop taking these meds. - Mr Vasser's football should be starting to help with the fatigue. - Yeah well that didn't really work out. - [Dr. Flahavan] You've stopped going to his sessions? - It's just football. - It's an integral element of the therapeutic regime we set for you. - Yeah it's just I don't remember you prescribing special needs football for my mom. Or doing anything else that worked. - After your mother died. - After she killed herself. - When she succumbed to her illness I of course went through all the decisions that were made. - That you made. - That were made in her treatment by me, yes, and on reflection there is one decision that I now think I got wrong. - Yeah, what was that? - In retrospect it was a mistake to allow her to continue to be treated in an outpatient context. - You can't lock me up for not playing football with retards. - We have a plan Gabriel, and you need to stick to it. - He doesn't know what the rule is Eric, tell him what the rule is. - What are you doing back here? - I'm here to play, doctors orders. - No doctor orders me what to do. - Look you don't understand alright, I have to. - If you can make friends with him you can play. Christopher, you ready for this guy to make friends? - And learn the rules. - Yeah, he has to learn the rules. - Yeah, whatever it takes. - Go on then, I want us to be friends. Say it. - I want us to be friends man, please. - And Christopher, you have to forgive him for what he did to yah because that's what we do when somebody's truly sorry for what they've done, right? - Okay. - So tell him. - I forgive you. - Good, let's shake on it. (gentle guitar music) Okay then, let's play. [Eric] Okay guys, great game today, well played everybody. Right let's collect the bibs, well played Shawn, those drills are really paying off. Okay guys, well player Robert. - [Christopher] What's your number? - Sorry. - I need your number, or you need mine. Otherwise how are we supposed to stay in touch and make arrangements? - We're not. - That's what friends do actually in case you didn't know. - Everything good here? - Yeah I'm just waiting to swap numbers. - He thinks we're supposed to stay in touch as friends. - Well you better give it to him then. Okay guys, all back to the car park. See you next week guys. (phone ringing) - Hello. Yeah I can't right now I'm kinda busy. No later's no good either, I'm rehearsing. Tomorrow? No I'm playing a show. (doorbell ringing) Listen I gotta go somebody's just come round. (doorbell ringing) Yeah, yeah, another friend, alright bye. (door slams) (snoring) - Do you start with the biggest drum or the smallest one? - What are you doing here? - Well you said you were playing tonight. So I looked up your name and found your bands name. Then I looked up that name and found out you were playing here tonight before another band that's better then you. Then I looked up the bus timetables. - Listen you can't be here right now okay. - Everything okay? - You cool for tonight yeah? - Yeah. - Hi I'm Gabriel's friend Christopher. Are you his friend too? - I'll just get the gear. - Did you know that the average height of the top five goalkeepers in the world is one meter 92 centimeters, that's six foot three and a half inches. - Can you please stop talking about goalkeeping. - Can you please not touch me. - Listen I kind of need to come across as together right now, especially in front of those lads. You're not helping. - [Christopher] Well I'm trying to help. - I don't want you to help. Look it's not you man, alright, it's your, you know your mental health issue. - I don't have a mental health issue, I have Asperger's, it's a syndrome, not a mental health issue. - Whatever. - You have a mental health issue, Eric told me, he said that you have bipolar and also maybe one or two other things. - Alright, just keep talking about goalkeeping, just keep it down will yah. - You gonna do the sound check are yah? - Yeah two minutes. Don't touch that. - Some really famous goalkeepers are actually only one meter 73 centimeters or five foot eight inches. (audience applauding) - Thank you. Hey sorry I was a bit dead tonight. - What's with your little friend? - He's not my friend man, he's just a guy I play football with. - You're playing football now are yah? - Yeah, just get fit you know, stay sharp, it's kind of a charity thing too. - We better get the gear off. - Yeah sorry it's private back here. - Just I sorted your equipment out. - What you do with it? (gentle piano music) You packed the entire stage down by yourself in 15 minutes? - I'm good at organizing things. You're better then the listing magazine said you would be. A little better I mean. (laughing) - Do you fancy a beer? - By law I'm not allowed to have alcohol for 44 more days. - Yeah it's getting a bit late for you anyway isn't it? - I think you've just earned the right to break the law. - At the moment I'm one meter 80 centimeters or five foot 11 inches, but I'm only 17 and your body doesn't stop growing until you're at least 22 or older, so I think I'll be okay. - Yeah you're never gonna be six foot three. How tall is your dad? - I don't know, the last time I saw him I was only three years old, and I wasn't interested in goalkeeping then so I didn't ask him. He lives in another country now so I don't see him. - So you just live with your mom then? - No I live in St Cosmas. - What's that, like a home? - It's not a home, it's a residential unit for young people with so called developmental disorders who's families find it hard to cope. My mom lives with her new partner Jeremy but I'm moving back in to live with her when I'm 18. [Christopher] Do you live with your mom and dad I said? - They're both dead. - [Christopher] How did they die? - Doesn't matter. - Did they get knocked over? Or murdered? Or did they die of AIDS? You can treat AIDS now but maybe they caught it before then. - My dad had a heart attack and my mom killed herself okay. - Awkward. - What do you mean awkward? - Having to tell people your mother killed herself. How did she do it? - Awkward isn't the word that I'd choose, you could say selfish or stupid, or tragic, or you could just shut up, and not say anything at all. - Did she do it in some really embarrassing way you don't want to talk about? - Yeah that's exactly it, can we change the subject please? - Okay. How tall was your father? - I said let's change the subject. - I am changing the subject, I'm talking about goalkeepers again. - Look, thanks for helping me pack down the kit and all but tonight was a once off okay. - Are you not playing anymore concerts? - No, you're not to show up at anymore concerts. Or anywhere else around the band. - Do you play football? - Do I look like I play football? - Not regularly. (laughs) - You're funny. [To Gabriel] Maybe you just found your new roadie. - I gotta go. - Drink your beer man. (door opens) - Eric I drank beer. - [Eric] Hey, hey keep it down. - I drank four big glasses of beer Eric. - Where were yah? Okay let's get you up to bed. - That's my personal space. - Okay, okay but let's lower the volume, who gave you the beer? - My new friend Gabriel, and his friends, Pearse and Toss. Eric, I don't like beer. - I think we'll have to keep an eye on that new friend of yours. - That will be easy from now on. (gentle music) - No, no, I told yah. - He told me to come. - It's what you've been begging for isn't it, road crew. It's taking you about an hour to set up these days so maybe Christopher here can save us all some time yeah. We're gonna grab a coffee, be ready to play when we get back. - Listen this isn't gonna work. - Of course it will, I remember everything from the last day. It's kind of like LEGO but with much less pieces. (drum cymbals) Do you have LEGO? - [Gabriel] When I was a kid. - [Christopher] What sets did you have? - [Gabriel] I can't remember. - [Christopher] What age are you? - [Gabriel] 24. - You probably had the building site with the cement mixer, catalog number 423. Or the electric railway catalog number 454. - I actually did have the railway. My dad couldn't get it to work. - There were some faulty batches. - How can you possibly know there were faulty batches in LEGO train sets 15 years ago? - Because I'm interested in LEGO. - Hey, can you not say anything about my mental health to the other guys, can we just keep that a secret? As a favor to a friend. - Okay and in return you can practice penalties with me. Deal? - Yeah. - I'll show you my bass rig. - He's kind of works isn't he? - Yeah I guess. - And you're starting to feel better yeah? - Yeah, yeah no I feel a lot clearer, clean. - At the show next week there's a management guy coming, big guy. - Are you serious? That's great man, yeah look good management is all we need. - So we've got to be kicking, he's looking for energy. Thursday night you're our crew, wear black. - Are white shoes okay? (laughs) - Yeah white shoes are fine man.

Many of the greatest minds ever have been aspe, Einstein, Beethoven, David Byrne. Roly organized a petition for us asking to have our own private area, but they won't even listen to us.

They don't always tell the truth. - You shouldn't say things like that about somebody who's thinking about being my girlfriend. She said she was your girlfriend for a while. - Yeah for about two minutes when I was off my face. Look I'm not saying it to be mean alright, it's just you deserve someone you can trust, and trust you back, actually believe in you, you know. - What are the rules for making people believe in you? - [Gabriel] There aren't any rules man. - There must be some rules. - I don't know, I guess you just show them what you're really feeling inside. - But suppose you show them what you're really feeling inside and they don't really like it? Now you're not concentrating. - She took an overdose, my mom. Paracetamol, took her like four days to die. - My mom takes paracetamol sometimes. - She was conscious for most of that time but she wouldn't let me in to see her. She wouldn't even say goodbye. - Maybe she had too much on her plate as it is, that's what my mom says. Did you catch your mental illness from her? - Yeah maybe, maybe that's it. - What's it like? - What losing my mother? - No your mental illness. - It's like on the days you're up anything can happen, you're like Batman, nothing's impossible. - That's more like Superman Batman doesn't have any actual powers. - Yeah Superman then, and then on the next day it's the total opposite. Nothing can happen, everything's impossible, you feel hopeless. - But luckily you're taking your medication now so you feel better. - You know what I don't feel better man. Just feel more and a lot of what I feel is sad and angry and ashamed and scared. - So just the normal emotions humans are supposed to have. (gentle guitar music) It's my birthday next Wednesday. - Yeah I'd totally forgotten, you're turning 18, big day. - Will you come to my birthday party? Is at 5:30 at my moms. - Your folks may not approve of me. - I'll be a responsible adult then so they can't tell me who to be friends with. (Gabriel laughs) (rhythmic drum beat) - Hi. - I thought you'd be in bed. - No my sleep's all over the place man. May as well practice as lie awake. Were you working late? - Yeah, yeah there was a problem that came up, sorted now, storm in a teacup. - Brought your bass with yah? - Yeah, yeah I had to get a bit of work done on it. The action was a bit out, I'm just gonna take this to my room. - Nah man, stay and have your beer. I don't miss it honestly. - You must be bored, off the spliff and the booze, stay in every night. - Well actually I'm out tomorrow night, well tea time, it's Christopher's birthday party. - Ah you don't have to do that mate. Can't you make an excuse. - Nah, nah I wanna go. - Well, you kids have fun. (laughs) - Hi. - Hey. - We were all waiting for you. - Yeah he's always been terrible at keeping time. - Well you're just in time for tea. Sausages, plain pasta with butter and broccoli, all nicely separated. - Hello you, Pearse told me there's a practice session tonight. - Yeah well he was winding you up. There was never a practice session tonight, besides you have a boyfriend now right. - Are you jealous? - So I believe you two know each other through the music. - Yeah. - Not really. Anyway, happy birthday man. It's just a small thing. - Cool that's what all the crew guys use. - I'd say you know all about that. - Sorry? - Don't mind me, I'm only teasing. - It's not nice to tease Jeremy. - What line of work are you in then? - How do you mean? - Well you're hardly making a living from drumming are yah? - We're doing alright actually, and my mom left me some money. - Well that's not gonna last forever is it. - Leave him alone Jeremy, you were young once. - I always made my own way. - Yeah doing what? - Doing whatever it took to put food on the table son. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Christopher ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (cheering and applauding) - We'd better be getting his nibs back to the unit.

Hey listen mate, let's practice penalties this week okay for as long as you want. - Okay. - Okay, alright. Happy birthday man. - Thanks. - [Mom] I'll see you out Gabriel, thanks a million for coming. - You can't do this to him. - I beg your pardon. - You're never gonna let him move back in here are yah? - I think I know what's best for my own son. There's a very good adult unit at St David's and they've agreed to take him. He'll be very happy there. - He's been living for this day, alright. When were you gonna tell him? - You don't have a child do yah? So you're not gonna understand. But if ever you do believe me, the one thing you'll want more then anything else is for them to find someone else in the world who loves them as much as you do. When you know that that's never gonna happen. - You give up on them. - You toughen up, you have to. - He's my friend. - Whatever that means to you.

You wanted me to get straight remember. You both did. - We just wanted you to be more workable with, you were out of control. - And now? - Now you're too in control.

(door slams) (somber guitar music) (rhythmic drum beat) - I thought you didn't have any shows until next month. Are you rehearsing today because Gabriel's supposed to be practicing penalties with me. I'm always free. - You sure about this? - Yeah why not, I mean he knows the gear and it's the biggest show of our lives. - Yeah but they're kind of friends though. Him and Gabriel. - I don't think there's much future in that friendship. (rhythmic drum beat) (door slams) (tense music) - Crews here, exactly like you did last time yeah. - Yeah. - Christopher this is Joey, he'll be playing with us this evening. - Playing what? - Drums, Joey, Christopher here has you all set up. - Thanks man, sweet. - Gabriel plays your drums. - Yeah but it will be Joey from now on. But don't worry we still want you to crew for us. [Toss] You're great at this man, plus we'll be paying yah. 100 a show, more soon with any luck. - But Gabriel's my friend. - We're your friends too. - Not as much as he is. Oh you were only joking. - You, so you knew as well. You didn't even give me a chance to prove myself. - You've had your chance. - What he told you I was on medication. - We all know you're on medication. I don't give a shit if you're on heroin or lithium or your vitamins or horse tranquilizers. I don't give a shit if you're stark raving mad as long as you're the right type of mad for this band, and you're not. You never will be. You're done man. - Is that my kit up on stage? - It's band property. - And you set it up for him? You don't mind if I sound check then do yah? For old times sake. (rhythmic drum beat) Thank you and good night. - That was pretty intense. - Why are you kissing her? - Because it's meant to be. - We're friends, you're not supposed to kiss my girlfriend. - How retarded are you? We were never friends, and by the way because you completely missed the point your mom's never gonna let you back into her house. - Yes she is, in a few weeks. - No she's not, not ever. And you know what, she's right. When you get too old for St Cosmas she's just gonna ship you off to some other dump for grown up freaks. You're never moving home. - You shouldn't say that, not even as a joke, it's not a good joke. - A joke. I'll show you how serious I really am. You coming? - What is this place? - Do you have a light? Wait here. (suspenseful electronic music) (camera clicks) (fire alarm blaring) - Jesus, where were you? - Drive. Drive. (upbeat rock music) - Why do you want to go to Nevo's house? (doorbell ringing) Is she really gonna hire you? - She's come to see me play like seven times, what do you think? - Are you sure this is even her house? - I can see a light on. (police siren wailing) - I'm going. - So go. I don't need yah. - [Roly] Eric, Eric we have a big problem. - We know Roly. - No not this, another one, they've abolished us. - Sorry. - There won't be any Asperger's syndrome anymore, we'll all just be autistic. - Says who? - The American Psychiatric Association. - It was just a label Roly. - It was our label and they've abolished it. - Well it's the way of the world I'm afraid. - [Roly] Then the world isn't fair. - Roly this really isn't the moment.

Far better this than jail, or God forbid. - [Gabriel] At least with jail I'd have a release day. - Look the logic here is clear, in the absence of a family member or any other responsible person willing to oversee your treatment you need to stay in an inpatient setting. Do keep reaching out to people, build bridges, makes amends. - From in here, how? - You could try writing letters. (gentle guitar music) - [Gabriel] Dear Alice, I'm sorry for all the trouble and pain I've caused you. I hope some day you feel able to give me one more chance. Dear Toss, sorry about messing everything up for you, and for Pearse, I hope the new drummer is working out. To whom it may concern I want to apologize for setting myself on fire on your wall. I've mistaken your home for somebody else's, not that that excuses my behavior. Dear Christopher. - I've got a treat for you. - A letter? - And the doctor said you can have this back once you follow the rules. - Thanks. (somber piano music) - So no more nasty stomach cramps. - Gone, I feel good. I still haven't heard back from my sister, or anybody else that I've written too. - I'm afraid people do move on. - It's just I've done everything that I've been asked to do. - I think you're doing fantastically but it's not up to me as you know. - The tribunal would take your views onboard. - Persevere with your sister, I really think that's the best course. There is one teeny thing that's raising some concern, this new hobby of yours, and what it's costing you. All these deliveries. - It's my money. - Of course it is, it's just with your previous history of destroying and discarding things important to you. - No look it's nothing like that I swear. - Okay, no panic. Seeing as you're doing so well we won't make a big fuss about this. - Thank you. - For now. - Easy guys, there's enough for everyone. - Do I have to be in goals again? - We'll take turns Georgina. - Do you know anything about this? - Christopher. It arrived today, in a delivery lorry. - It's got a couple of little things wrong. - Yeah we all do son. (upbeat music) - I accept your apology because that's what you do when somebody says they're sorry, or shows you. If they're your friend especially. - I was the shittiest friend you could have possibly had. - Just because you got mentally ill again. I'm still at the unit like you said. - Look I was being crazy and mean when I said that. - You were right, my mom prefers living with Jeremy in the house and just seeing me for visits. Jeremy pays for me to live in St Cosmas, and he'll pay for me to move to St David's in a few weeks once the paperwork is organized. - I miss our practices. - I could bring a ball next time. - I don't think football is allowed here, but please come again anyway. Nobody else does. - I don't have many other things in common with you. (laughs) - Yeah well, that's the best thing about yah. - I had an idea. - An idea? - Well Roly had it but he said we could use it if we wanted to. - What kind of idea? - What do you think? - I think you're out of your mind and Roly. - That' the exact point we're not. - [Gabriel] Have you shared this with Eric? - Yes. - [Gabriel] And he was happy about it? - He was really happy. (laughs) - Look you haven't thought this through okay. I mean for a start there's my sister, what's she gonna say. - Maybe nothing. - Then there's your mom. - Sweetheart, you know we couldn't agree to anything like that. - Wait, let me get this straight. - Then there's Dr. Flahavan, you haven't met her have yah? - Not yet. - In over 20 years of psychiatric practice that is the single most unusual thing I've heard uttered in this room. I mean have you any scientific basis for this idea of yours. - And that's all before we get to the tribunal. I mean what chance do you think we have of persuading them? - A good chance, this is a completely logical argument. - [Gabriel] I don't think that logic is gonna be enough here. - Why not? Here are the rules and this is why we come under them. We have an answer to every single question they could ask. - Yeah and they have total discretion. They can turn us down even if we do answer every question they ask. - Suppose it did work, would it make you happy? - Yeah, yeah it would make me happy. Alright, I'm in. Look whatever happens just coming up with this man, just trying, you've already done a huge thing for me. Biggest thing anyone's ever done. - You just need to practice your speech. - No, no, you do. They're never gonna listen to me, they might just listen to you. - Everybody's good at some things and... Everybody's good at some things and... Everybody's good at some things and... - [Female] This is an impressive piece of research you've presented Christopher, and you're right. There is no specific legal bar to someone with high functioning autism such as yourself seeking to have a patient released into their care. And between the one off payment your step father has agreed to make and your future residential care costs for yourself, and what remains of Gabriel's own inheritance your idea is in principle economically viable. - [Male] What I have to ask is, why? Why would you do this for someone who let you down so badly in the past? - And more importantly how can we be sure that your commitment here today can survive whatever the future might bring? (chair scraping) - Everybody's good at some things and not good at other things. People always says that. But what if the things you're good at aren't the right things for you to have a proper life? Well it doesn't ruin your life if you're not good at LEGO or football, but if you're not good at understanding people when they're not telling the truth then you're not allowed to have a job, or a house or a wife, which isn't fair because you're not the one not telling the truth but you're the one being punished. Eric, you're invading my space. - [Male] Christopher this meeting is about Gabriel's situation, not your own. - No it's just the same with him, the things he's not good at means that the things he is good at don't count. It's like LEGO, where you lose one piece and you can't finish your kit you're building because of that one piece you're missing. So you throw it away, it's a waste because somebody else might easily have that piece you're missing. He's good at understanding people but he's not good at staying in control. I'm good at staying in control but I'm not good at understanding people. We each have a piece the other one is missing. So if we could just have a chance, if you could just give us a chance to share those things instead of two wasted people there could be none. - Thank you Christopher. (chair scraping) Well I think we've heard everything we need to. - Have they listened to me? Have they listened to me I said? - [Gabriel] No mate I don't think they have. - [Christopher] Why not? - Because I think that they just can't imagine the idea of somebody with a developmental disorder. - Neuro diverse is our new word. - Neuro diverse person like you standing guardian to a mentally ill person like me. - Can I ask on what basis are you so confident that such an arrangement could actually work? - Confident. (Laughs) Here's the thing people don't tell you about this. Once you go over the edge, once you know where it is, how close it's always been, how it's always gonna be there just one tiny wrong step away, confidence isn't something that I've been having much of lately about the future, about playing the drums or holding down a job or having a relationship, or my family ever wanting to see me again. I can't honestly say that I'm confident about anything anymore. But the one thing that I do know is that if I ever screw up again, and I probably will some time he is always gonna be there. I mean he just won't go away. And I'm not just confident about that okay, I'm sure. - You really believe you deserve to be given this chance? - No I don't, but he deserves to be given this chance and I'm lucky enough to be a part of it. - You have to take them exactly like they are in the container. - I know. - I set an alarm on your phone to remind you. And you have three sessions of therapy, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 10, 11 and 10 again. - Have you not got packing to do? - I'll call you every morning to make sure you remember. I packed last night. - Okay, but if anything weird happens alright, or if anybody's mean to you. - I'm 18, I'll remember everything you said. These are all the places we're going. - Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin. That's further then I ever got. (car horn blaring) - That's them. - Oh hey, are you gonna bring that? - They like football and their manager said maybe we can practice on days off. - Yeah it's just you might not have time you know. - Well I can practice in my head anyway. - Okay. Could be useful for a drum tech. - Very useful. - You're gonna do great man, have fun. See you in three weeks alright. - Two weeks and five days. Enjoy your new job too. (bright piano music) - Looks good Glen. - Good luck. - Thanks. Alright Roly. - Don't distract me, I'm filling out my application for Stamford. - Stamford, wow man hope you get in. - Well of course I'll get in. - So just a few parents right? - Plus supporters and donors, 40 tops. - 40 Jesus. - You've done brilliantly getting the guys together. I mean they're almost listenable now. (laughs) Only joking. - Alright so guys we're gonna play this right through to the end okay. We're gonna start and finish together alright.
