NETFLIX PRESENTS - [phones ringing] - [indistinct chatter] [inspector 1] Name? - [man] Sedat Yücel. - [inspector 1] Occupation? [Sedat] I work at the Konya Prison. I'm a guard there. Twenty-nine years now. Let's begin. Mr. Sedat, you're not giving testimony. Nor will this be considered an interrogation. This is an interview being conducted in light of the inquiry brought by the Ministry of Justice and carried out with your consent. However, you could be prosecuted as a result of this interview, putting at risk your job and retirement status, with repercussions on your rights, those you have or may attain as a government official. Sure. Of course. [inspector] All right. Then let's begin. On the day of the incident, specifically on Wednesday, April 25th, 2018, was the prisoner Musa Solak under your supervision? [breathes deeply] Yes. [cellmate 1] Spotify. - [cellmate 2] Huh? - [cellmate 1] Spotify, you know? [cellmate 2] S... "Stopify?" [cellmate 1] "Spotify." It's an app. "Spot." You know, like Spot, the dog. - Okay, fine. Whatever. So what is it? - [cellmate 3 snoring] So, you go online, you open this app, and you can listen to any song you want. High school kids, they go nuts for it. - Is it free, or do you...? - Yeah, it's free. [cellmate 3 grunts] Only problem is Internet isn't. Okay, fine. So you were saying? - Uh-huh. - The program? How do you... How do I open it? Did you ever play any games online before you were sent here? - Sure, at the Internet café. - Okay. You click on something, you know? You click on a shape or something and that opens the game. - Yeah. - Right. Well, it's the same thing. The app opens when you click on it. It looks like my razor marks. There's these three lines. They're on top of something green. Always reminds me of this. [chuckles] [girl 1] Now I'm sure he has a girlfriend, definitely. He hasn't been home before two in the morning this whole month. Um, you mean your father? No, Uncle Sam. Have you even listened to a word I've said. Why all this gloom? [girl 2] Sorry. Things are shit at home. At least your dad's around sometimes. What am I supposed to do? Look, your not having a dad is something even the kids who arrived last week know. Just get over it. - Hey... - [girl 1] I'm going for a smoke. - You can keep me company if you like. - No, just go ahead. By the way, he's coming soon, you know. Could be in a couple of days. He... You mean your father? - [girl 2] No, Uncle Sam. - [scoffs] That's nice. Then you can introduce me. I dunno. How am I supposed to do that? I mean, he'll only be here one night. [girl 1] Yeah, so? I'll drop by. Our houses are, like, literally next to each other. Meaning I'll see him for five minutes. Okay? Or don't you have the balls? Don't be ridiculous. Are you out of your mind? That's insane. And besides, he's only gonna be here for the night. I mean, I can't just go and drive him away saying, "Hey, you gotta meet my friend." [indistinct background chatter] [knock at door] Yes? You wanted to see me, sir. Yes, Sedat. One of the prisoners was granted leave. Musa Solak. Next week he'll be headed home for a day and it'll be under your supervision. Uh, well, sir, I'm, uh, I'm retiring next week. I'm aware. But you needn't worry about Musa. He's a good man. He's got a good head on his shoulders. On the 24th you'll head out. Once you're done, you head back the next morning and finish up for the night. All right? [grunts softly, sighs] See, my daughter's coming from Italy, so... Sedat! I've got way more work here than I can handle so just cut me a break and do the transfer. Of course, I'll take care of it. I'm sorry, sir. Check with Behçet regarding expenses. And bring him back before he's due in the evening. All right? I'll make sure of it. - May I go, or... - Yeah, go. [indistinct chatter] [soft instrumental music plays] [indistinct chatter] [music playing over speakers] [man] Hello, my little dove. What, you're not even gonna say hi? Sorry, I didn't see you. Oh, you didn't? I know you're teasing me. Come on. Oh, am I? [grunts lightly] I... better run. I am kinda late. All right. Get going, then. Maybe you and I can hang out somewhere more quiet later. [cellmate 2] You were so little. Back then, I mean. Well, uh... What I mean is... [sucks teeth, sighs] No. Hi, Yonca. How are you? Wow, you sure have grown a lot. [softly] Oh, fuck. [sucks teeth, sighs] [clears throat] My oh my, Yonca. Like your new place? You know you were actually born there, right? But don't you worry. I'll be back in no time at all, you know what I mean? [chuckles] [sighs] The kid's not gonna give a crap when you come back, dumbass. [breathes deeply] Hi, Yonca. I'm Musa. I'm your papa. - [man] There you are, gentlemen. - [both] Thanks. Did he tell you anything that struck you as suspicious? Maybe some thing that might have hinted at what he wanted? [lighter clicks] No. He didn't say anything particularly strange. [grunts] He was pretty excited, though. To see his daughter? [Sedat] Well, yeah. I mean, he hadn't seen her in 14 years. That's why they were letting him out for a bit. So how come it'd been that long? His wife wouldn't allow it. She just told her he was dead, so case closed. And to make sure it stayed like that, she had to keep her from going over there, and never let him so much as write her a letter. Sheesh, so what was it that made her come around? [Sedat] She didn't. She passed away. From what? Traffic accident. And then? Then they decided to send the girl to the woman's parents, who didn't want her, of course. So after that, it was his old mother who ended up with her. The woman has advanced-stage Alzheimer's. So... Well, that would explain the odd release timing. [Sedat] You've never seen one photo of her until now? Not even one? [Musa] She never sent me any. [Sedat] And they were in Antalya too? [Musa] No. Um, after I went to prison, she went to her father's, to Urfa. Wrote there too. Tried calling her... And what happened? Well, nothing. [Sedat] So then, how'd you get this photo? For that, I have a woman named Nuriye to thank. She lives near us. She did a lot for us, you know what I'm saying? She sent this photo three or four days ago. I think... she didn't really want to. You got kids of your own? [Sedat] Yep. One daughter. - She's 25 now. - That's nice. God bless her. - Amen. God bless them all. - Amen. [sighs softly] Musa, you said... your wife was angry with you. That you fought over something. What was it? Uh, well, we... [somber music plays] We had to get married because she got pregnant. And then, one night, we argued. [indistinct distorted chatter] [baby crying] [no audible dialogue] Look at this child! Look at this face! God damn you, Musa! I swear you'll never see her again! [baby crying] I... I loved another woman... We really didn't know each other that well. We were young and stupid. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct announcement over PA] [somber instrumental music plays] [clucking] [Sedat] Do, uh... Do the police know about this place? You bet, they know everything. [music playing over shop speakers] [music continues] Hey, can we just keep going, please? - Elif's calling. Just hold on... - Wait. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. So, what's up? I'm in Antalya right now. I've got escort duty for a couple of days. Heading back tomorrow, though. Say what? Well, weren't we gonna... Don't tell me that. Your mother is gonna be very upset. Well, what's she supposed to say on the phone? So you wouldn't get upset. Huh? Please don't do this to us right now, you can't. Haven't you made things complicated enough for once in your lifetime? Give me a break, huh? Seriously have to bring this up right now? Yeah, but... Uh... Hello? Hey, is everything okay? [Sedat] Oh, it's fine. Kids, you know... There, that's it. Welcome, Musa. Thank you, Nuriye. - This is Sedat. - Oh, welcome. - Thank you very much. - So, uh... [clears throat] He... He's supervising me. [Nuriye] Oh, I see. Uh... [somber music plays] Well, welcome back. - [man] Get over here! - [woman] Let me go! [woman and man shouting] [woman] Fuck off of me! I'll just sit over here, then... Oh, no, please don't. I have something in the kitchen. You really didn't have to. It's not necessary. Oh, come in, please. - It's really not a problem. - Okay. - Mom home? - Yes. Mom! Oh, my beautiful mother! Are you waiting for your son here by the window? - [kisses] Huh? - [door closes] Who are you? What makes you think you're my son? Mom, it's me. You remember? Whose home do you suppose you're in? Who are they, Nuriye? Mom, it's me, Musa, your son. - Don't you recognize me? - More rubbish? [scoffs, chuckles] Can you believe what he's saying? There was an İksan in our village. And there was Ramazan, her husband. So, you remember Ramazan? I haven't ever forgotten him. Pitifully ill, that Ramazan. [inhales] I hope he managed to get better somehow. He did, he recovered. Don't worry about it. Oh, he did? - [Musa] Uh-huh. - Uh-huh? Oh... He told me to tell you... well, that you don't need to worry. [sighs] And how does one not worry, hmm? [Nuriye] Come on. Why don't we go lie down in the other room for a bit? I think it's just that you're a little tired, is that right? - [mother] Yeah, okay. - [Nuriye] Yeah. Oh... [sighs] Just for a little bit, you can get up later. Who are these men? - Can you go tell them to leave? - I will, just come with me over here. [mother] I feel sleepy. [Nuriye] There we go, just take it easy. So terrible, I'm sorry. All I can offer you are my prayers. And you have my gratitude. Oh, what are you doing? Have a seat. - Really don't have to, it's... - Please. - Nuriye. - What? Um... How does she... Is she ever okay, or...? Doctor says it's intermittent. All right. I mean, not like she knows anyway. She's off in her own world, you know? [laughs] You must be hungry. Let's all sit down, everything's ready. - Thank you. - Please, I insist. Thanks. Thank you very much. - Nuriye... - Uh... Yes? She still in school, okay? And then she'll come home after her test. - Come on. - Okay. [phone beeps, ringtone plays] MRS. AYŞENUR FROM THE BANK [inspector 1] That phone call, why'd it distract you so much? Well... 'Cause my daughter... She canceled on us, so of course I was upset. That's why. Why'd she bail on you? It's because her fiancé, he comes from money. Elite type with tons of connections, you know. An Italian estate. The whole nine yards. Finally they came back to Istanbul for a week. Just a few short days. So, of course, we did everything to prep. [breathes deeply] So, in the end, one thing or another ended up getting in the way. But they couldn't make it to see us, and they returned. And that's it. That's why I got upset. - That's all. - [inspector 2] Hmm. They've got money, at least. [both laugh] I don't care if they're rich. I know very well what my personal responsibilities are and what I owe to them. Yeah, but you know that money won't ever be a problem for you guys. - Yeah, must be nice. - [chuckles] [exhales deeply] [Sedat clears throat] What's the problem? Nothing. [clears throat] - It's really good. - I can make some thing else in no time. No, no. I just don't have much appetite, that's all. - If you're sure. - But thank you. Because of that phone call? [softly] No. I just... I'll be right back. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. Hello, dear. Welcome, welcome. Come inside. [gentle music playing] Well, you heard him. Come on now. Go on. [clears throat] Pleasure to meet you. I'm Musa. Um, I know. Huh. Ah, wait, wait, wait. I, uh... I made it for you. Uh, there's room for pictures. Plenty. It's kind of you. You must be hungry. Want a snack? - I am pretty hungry. - Healthy appetite. [Musa chuckles softly] [chuckles nervously] Fuck no. Yeah, I see it, but I'm not a big believer in trusting my gut, you know? Tell me about it. So, you gonna be there tonight? [upbeat music playing over speakers] Uh, maybe. But even... Yeah, but since the bastard's been back... Okay. Fine, got it. No problem. Call you back soon. Yeah, I'll be there. Son of a bitch! I can't wipe my ass without this fucker up in my face about it every 15 minutes. - [sighs] Get me some coffee. - [man] Yes, sir. [birds chirping] [Musa chuckles] An old military buddy, pretty well off too... he said to me, "Musa, would you've ever believed a pot of tea'd feel like a luxury before you joined the military?" [chuckling] Thought we'd never stop laughing. The army put a lot of things into perspective. So did prison. So, how's school? Okay. Oh, I see. [inhales] [grunts softly] [clears throat] It's not... Sitting across from you here... it's not easy. Because I want... The thing is... [sighs] You're not my little girl anymore. And I just don't wanna miss more than I have already. [inhales] The past is past, and it just can't be changed anymore. [siren wailing in distance] Don't worry about it. [Musa] No, no. Just, don't blame your mother. - [mother] What are you doing over there? - Two seconds, all right? - Tell me what you're looking at. - I'm not looking, really. - Let me see what's out there. - I promise, I'm not. Musa and Yonca just caught my eye. - Musa made it? - Musa made it. - Can I see? - Now, just give him a minute first. Why don't you eat something? Then I'll take you to see him. Come on. But who else is with him? Yonca's there. Your granddaughter. Remember? Your granddaughter? [softly] Yonca. - Yonca! - Okay, that's... You're okay, come on. - [crying] Yonca! - Shh. Now's not the time. - Yonca. - Come on. Hey, what's wrong? - You're okay. - My dear... - [crying] Yonca. - Come on, now. I've got you. Come on, you're tired today, aren't you? Let's go in here. Because you might try, but you just might end up trapped here. That's why you have to look out for yourself. Protect yourself and watch your back. And the minute they're done with me, we'll be gone. - [dog barking] - [kids chattering] We say goodbye. We're gone? We're gone. I did ask. Too many times. Gülendam, I can't ask every day, can I? - As if they aren't already suspicious. - What's suspicious about your pension? You have every right to ask anything you want. Look, these things don't work like that. It's going to go to accounting, whether they say yes or whether they say no. What's asking 50 times gonna do? Not to mention what they're saying behind my back. [exhales] And pray tell, what have they said about you? They should just mind their own business. Don't they have any actual work to do? - Sedat. - Hmm? Yeah, what? So, Nafiz, the draper... One of his workers was asking for you this morning while you were gone. Nafiz, he wants to meet with you soon. Are they sending his boys to ask me that? - Son of a bitch. - He said he called but you didn't answer. And how about the money from the loan shark, Sedat? Huh? What are you even saying, huh? I'd pick up. I would if I could, then I would. I... I'm on duty, not vacation. I couldn't pick up. But I'll call for sure. Uh... Don't worry. Gülendam, uh, have you heard from Elif? She won't be calling. No more, she said. All right, I have to go. I'll be home as soon as I've dropped off the prisoner tomorrow. - Please, call if you need me. - Okay. [people on TV speaking Turkish] - Why don't I help you out? - Oh no, I'm fine on my own. I'm pretty good. - I don't doubt it. - Oh... [grunts softly] [sighs] - Nuriye. - Hmm? I saw something weird when we were at the coffee house. Someone watching us. Don't worry about that. I'm sure it's nothing. Okay, fine. But I know a little more about these things and that's why I'm telling you. Nuriye, um... - What time are they leaving? - [inhales sharply] We're leaving first thing in the morning, okay? So, you don't have to... You don't have to worry. Uh, she means... Her papa's leaving, so she must be sad, isn't that right? Wasn't there anything in the girl's demeanor that might've signaled trauma? Not that I saw. Uh... She seemed perfectly fine when I was talking to her. Shall we get a bite? No, I'm not hungry. Thanks. - I'm gonna order in. Do you want anything? - [inspector 2] Yeah. - [inspector 1] Mm. So what do you want? - [inspector 2] I'm not sure. Go ahead and choose, I'm good with anything. Kebabs, shawarma, whatever you like. - [inspector 1] So kebabs, then. - [inspector 2] Yeah, sure. [inspector 1] Good, I want kebabs too. [inspector 2] Actually, I think I want shawarma. - [inspector 1] Shawarma? Regular or large? - [inspector 2] Regular. [inspector 1] İhsan. İhsan. - [İhsan] Yes, sir? - Come here, we have a lunch order. - Uh, sorry, I have a... - [inspector 2] Yeah? [inspector 1] One kebab... Maybe you'd know something about my pension, about when I'd get it? - [inspector 1] Airan? - [inspector 2] Airan. When do you need it? I believe in June. I need my retirement bonus before the wedding. [inspector 2] That sounds tricky. - Oh. - [inspector 1] Get that order in. All right. Almost forgot. This came from the Director to be signed. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised. [phone alert chimes] You said, "you believe?" I'm sorry? You said you believe you need it by June, like you heard it from someone else. You don't know the date? - I really said "believe"? - [inspector 2] Mmm. Hmm. I misspoke, I guess. Uh, June 5th's the right date. Yeah. - [birds chirping] - [somber music playing] [breathes deeply] What are you doing in my room? [Musa] I'm not doing anything. This is my room. You're not supposed to... - All right. - Nebahat. He's a friend. I promise, he's a friend. - What? - I know him. So now you're bringing strange men into this house, you whore? [chuckling] What are you saying? Why would I bring a strange man back here? [chuckles] I should be going. Shoo. Shoo! That man shouldn't be in my house. - Who brought him? - I'll take care of it. - You'll see that he's... - Please sit down. [mother] Some strange man, in my house. Going through my things. [Nuriye] It's all right. He didn't do anything. So, how have you been? Been okay. I'll be out soon. I'm waiting for that. That's good. Apo keeps asking about you. Yeah. We're always watching over the house. Thanks. Thank you. God bless you. - How's Apo's business? - It's grown a lot. The turnover is over a half mill. - We got the tourist trade too, thank God. - Half a million? Yeah, it's not bad. But with big opportunities come big challenges. How much of that goes to costs? I bet it's practically nothing. Yeah, only last year, 84 of our men were arrested. In a single year. They're all being taken care of. Do the math. They got a hold of almost two and a half tons of dope in the bust. We lost around 200 pounds of cheese. And 240,000 pills. What are you supposed to say to the guy that handed it to you? "Gee, I'm sorry about that, I'm afraid the cops took it?" - What are you gonna say? - Sorry. Sure. Whatever you say, you'll be screwed. Once you get out, Apo will definitely want you by his side. I have to get out first. And I'm not expecting to need that. I hope I won't need it ever. Hey, don't get me wrong. It's not because you need it. It's because we need you, Musa. - Is Apo still there? - No. He's got a nice place in Lara now. But he still comes to the neighborhoods. What for? The accounts. The coffee house is Haluk's now. He comes for prayer every night. Checks the accounts every night like clockwork [dog barking] Is someone looking at us? Anyway, Kadir... I should go before he sees me. Take care of my family. Don't you worry. - No, I won't take it. - Shh. I have money. Okay? Say hi to everyone. What's going on, man? [indistinct chatter, laughter] [indistinct conversations] - May God accept your prayers. - Amen. - Welcome, sir. - Thank you. Come in. - Good to see you, sir. - May God accept your prayers. - Any news? - Nothing. We didn't see him again. They didn't leave the house. - Here you go, boys. From the boss. - Go ahead, guys, you know the drill. - Hey! Leave some for the kids. - [laughing] Is Nuriye still around? [Haluk] Yeah. She didn't leave the house all day either. And where's Kadir? He went in the afternoon. He, uh... He'll be here. He isn't back yet. [Apo] What kind of fucked up shit is this? He has three years left. What's this leave crap all about? You sure Musa doesn't know anything? Nothing. Don't worry. If he did, we'd have wind of it by now. Kadir called me and said there were no problems, not to worry. You asshole! You only said he didn't come back is all. How would I have known? You didn't tell me anything. That's because you only think with your dick, you fool! If you didn't... - [tense music playing] - [exhales deeply] You fucking... Sorry, boss. There's only one slight problem, and that's with Erhan. We gave him till tomorrow to take care of it. Send someone to shoot him in the leg. Tell him that from now on he'll get one sixth of all the money he pulls in. And not a quarter like he was. Yeah, but a sixth leaves him no profit. - It's not worth it. - Listen to me! Prick's nothing but an addict. Bastard will take whatever I say. Yeah, sure. [indistinct TV program chatter] Um, Nuriye, do we... Do we have any dessert? Uh, no, we don't. I didn't think of that. Oh, but we have biscuits. - I'll get some. You can have them... - [Yonca] No, no. - ...with your tea. - That's okay. Thanks. [TV program playing indistinctly] Is that Instagram? - Huh? - Is that Instagram? Where you post pictures and write messages underneath? Uh, yeah, it's Instagram. So you have that, then? Uh, yeah, I do, but I'm not on it right now. - I'm texting a friend on WhatsApp. - Huh? WhatsApp. WhatsApp. Right. So you're on Facebook, right? Nuriye, where am I supposed to sleep? Yes, tonight is a bit of a problem. - You can stay with me. - No, no. She should sleep in her room like always. Really, I'll just curl up and sleep there in the corner. So we can share a room together for one night. Is that okay? Oh, sure. [Nuriye] Oh, okay. Then, maybe you stay with me. We have a spare room. - I'll prepare it for you. - No, I think it's better if I stay. We have to stay together, it's the law. Uh... It's better that way. We don't want any problems. I'll just sleep right here, it's okay. I mean, I can just sleep on the couch [Nuriye] Okay. I TOLD YOU. MY FATHER'S HERE. - SERIOUSLY? - YEAH. - WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. - DUDE, HE'S IN THE ROOM WITH ME. [message sent alert] YEAH, RIGHT! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO INTRODUCE US. I TOLD YOU. I CAN'T... Are you still texting someone? Yeah. Is it a boyfriend? Huh? You know, your friend texting you. Is it a boy? Oh, no. It's a girl. [chuckles] [chuckles] A girl. Good. [message alert chimes] Is it true you're not allowed to leave the house for any reason? Yeah. Why do you wanna know? [sighs] [footsteps shuffling] [soft clattering] [music playing over speakers] - [dog barking] - [woman] Let me go! Stop! No, please! No! Ah! [woman crying] No! [gun cocks, fires] [woman gasps, whimpers] - [screaming] - Okay! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. It's over. It's over! It's over. Nuriye, it's okay. It's okay. All right? [Nuriye crying] [shouts] [sobbing] [baby crying] So we're just gonna chat with your friend? Uh-huh. Just for two minutes. Small talk. - It won't take long. Don't worry. - No, it's okay. - And we're already out of the house. - We're just gonna drop by. Don't worry. Okay, maybe later we can take a walk around, yeah? Sure. And what if Sedat wakes up? So what? It's not like he's gonna tuck me in. - It's this building. - Okay. - Let's wait here. - Okay. [indistinct chatter] [Yonca] Oh. There she is. I can't believe you made me do this. - Good evening. - Good evening. - [Yonca] Well, here we are. - I can't believe it. It's true. I'm, uh... I'm really happy to get to know you, but I was joking. Yeah, right! You were joking? Come on. - Did you tell them anything? - I told them you were here. Said I'd hang out for a couple of minutes and go back in. So you really didn't believe I existed, did you? [girl] No, sir, it's not like that. [mockingly] "No, sir, it's not like that." So, what is it? OK, you're right. That was my problem. I'm sorry, we have to go now. Sure. I'll just have a cigarette now that I'm out here. Good night. Can I have one? In front of your dad? Oh... Um... Okay, I'll see you. Good night. I'm so glad you did this. - Getting you out of the house. - Yeah. - I'm sure you missed this place. - Not because of that. It's like we're having a father-daughter escapade. I'm gonna tell everyone when I get back. I hope Sedat didn't wake up and check the room. He won't. It's rude to check the room like that. I don't think he would. Why would he? He wouldn't. I'm not gonna run away. I only have three years left. Why would I run away? We should go back before you go crazy. [chuckles] Don't worry. [inspector 1] So you didn't realize they went out that night? No, I had no clue. I learned about that after the interrogation. I'm 100% at fault, I admit that. Uh... I was tired because we had left so early. I fell asleep as soon as I lay down. [inspector 1] How'd he get along with his daughter? The girl never really warmed up to him. Of course, I didn't know what the reason was then. And after finding out, he acted on it. [Sedat] Yes. Didn't Musa suspect anything from the girl's behavior, her attitude? No, the girl did nothing to raise any suspicion. What about Nuriye? Did she know that Apo had forced the girl into prostitution? [tense music plays] [inspector 2 tapping pen] [breathes deeply] Sure. She never told him so Musa wouldn't go insane. [train bell ringing] How was it with your mother? I mean, the two of you? You know... I mean, I'm just asking. You don't have to actually answer me. Hmm. Well, you know... I really don't... know. I didn't really know Nihan. She was your wife, wasn't she? That's right. [chuckles softly] [chuckles] What? - Why are you staring at me? - It's nothing, really. I like this. - Huh? - You. Because you're my daughter, that's why. I am, huh? [inhales] The minute I get out of prison, after that, we'll always be with each other. Okay? Do you mean it? Of course. Do you swear it? I swear it. - Selfie? - Huh? I... I want to take a photo of us together. To show my friends at school, if that's okay. Oh, sure. But who will take it? Um, me. Okay. [pleasant music playing] [Musa] Wow, this place has change so much. [Yonca] When was the last time you were here? [Musa] Well, I went to prison 15 years ago, so... [Yonca] Oh, right. It has changed a lot since then. [chuckles] How would you know? You come here often? Well, I heard my friends talking about it at school. I get along really well with Mom. - Huh? - I mean, we used to. Back in the street car, before, my mom and I? - Would you like me to tell you? - Sure. Please, tell me. Uh, we used to get along really well. She'd, you know, come home and we'd make dinner. Yeah. [woman] I'll be back later. I didn't cook anything, so you'll just have to eat the leftovers from last night. [Yonca] She used to tell me about her day. What happened at work or what made her laugh. Are you listening to me, girl? What did I just tell you? Hello? I'd tell her what happened at school that day. Got it. - We loved cooking with each other. - [woman] What do you do? Nothing. I'd say we were more like friends rather than daughter and mother. That's good. We'd have dinner together in the living room. I used to love drinking tea while watching TV. Our favorite shows were on three times a week. If they weren't on, we'd watch game shows instead. Sundays were our movie night, though. Sometimes we'd even go to a movie theater. And that was the best thing. Mom liked the popcorn, and I'd get this really sweet yogurt. You can get all kinds of things on yogurt. Chocolate, caramel, sprinkles, bits of fruit... - For sure, that was the best thing of all. - [woman] You're acting crazy! - "WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, 'TAME'?" - "IT MEANS TO ESTABLISH TIES." - [woman] Oh, fuck you! - [man] Fuck you, you whore! - [woman] Get out, you asshole! - [man] Oh, I'm the asshole? I liked the movies better, but Mom could never give up her soap operas. She'd watch these ridiculous cheesy ones, where they'd never actually get together. It's a little bit frustrating, you know? But the ones I really like are the ones with violence and mystery. And... More or less... Should we be getting back now? One more thing and then we'll go. [exhales] We can go inside if you're cold. No, I'm good. Did you ever come here when you were younger? This is the first time. It's been here since I was a little kid. It's pretty old. You see the guy with the mustache, over there? Mm-hmm. He owns the place. He was here back when I was still in middle school. I would come here every morning. It was like a ritual. He used to sell the very best éclairs in the whole world. I would ask my dad for money to buy one every single day. Anyway. Uh, one day I was here, as usual. Nuriye was here. [chuckles] And I knew I had to buy one for her too. You see over there? The first table on the left? The éclair tray was right there. I could only get one éclair, I didn't have enough money. So I had no choice. [chuckles] No way, did you take them? - Shh. He'll hear you. - [chuckles] But I did pay for one of them. Um, were you in love with her? [gentle music plays] Sure. Well, why didn't you ever get married? Uh... [sucks teeth] Uh... I really wanted to. But... [sucks teeth] The night I met your mother... I was drunk. And then... [sighs] ...things happened between us. - And your mother... - I get it. I get it. It's fine. I'm glad it happened, you know. Why? Now there's you. So you still love her, don't you? What do you... Nuriye? - And I think she still in love with you. - [chuckles] [chuckles] Really? Why are you laughing? It's obvious. [laughs] Are you afraid they might know you? If they see me now, it'll mean trouble for you. You keep on going. I'll go around back and jump over the fence. Once you pass the bar, it'll be safe and I'll meet up with you - Okay. - Go. Hey. What's up? Where are you going at this hour? Um, I, um... I was at a friend's house hanging out. I'm headed back home. Wanna come hang out with me? Huh? How about it? - What, now? - Yeah. Why can a friend see you now and I can't? I need to go. Come on. Just for a little. [tense music playing] - What did he say? - Who? Haluk? - "Haluk?" - Yeah. You should be calling him "Mr. Haluk." He's as old as me. You could even call him "Uncle." That's what he told me to call him. I used to call him "Mr. Haluk" before. [exhales] Okay. Go home. - Wait, where are you going? - You need to go home. All right. I'll address him as "Mr. Haluk." Please, don't start a fight. You'll get in trouble. Please! I'm begging you. Please. Let's go. Look. Use the back roads as much as you can. And don't walk in front of the bar anymore, all right? - [Yonca] Okay. - Until I get back. [Yonca] Okay. I won't. [Musa] Tomorrow morning, we're going back to Konya, and you're going back to your own life. You're going to have to manage without me for another three years. Three years. That isn't too long. Is it? You'll have finished high school by then. Maybe even have gotten into college. If you get into college in another city, we'll move there as well. We'll be together. Nuriye too. I'll get a job. Two, if I need to. I am a construction foreman, after all. I'll put my daughter through college. I'm a simple man. I don't want much for myself. What more could I possibly want? [crickets chirping] Nuriye? - I watched you leaving the house. - Huh? I saw you leave the house. We had a good long talk together. It was nice. Ah... - Well, what she doing? - She's asleep. Wanna sit? [dogs barking in distance] [water dripping] [distorted soundscape] [somber music plays] [indistinct chatter outside] [baby crying outside] [crying continues] You got your hair cut. Yeah, I did. I had it cut real short. - [chuckles] - And it grew back. This is my usual look. Been a while since I fixed it. - Does it look messed up and frizzy? Huh? - No. No. You look lovely. Thanks. I think I should let you rest. - Nuriye. - Huh? There's so much I want to say, I just can't find the words. I know. Sometimes I feel like that too. When? When I try to describe my feelings. I mean to. [Musa] Mm-hmm. - But, then... - But, then what? [sighs] This is silly, you'll probably just laugh. - No, I promise I won't... - There's no way I can... Now listen to me. I won't laugh, I promise. - You mean it? - Of course I do. It's about the letters I wrote to you. Yeah, okay. I really liked your letters. It's just that... there are many of them that I never sent you. What are you saying? That there were letters I wrote you that I never mailed. Why keep them from me? [scoffs] Who knows? I'm sorry. What's gonna happen to those letters? Tell me. - Can I read them? - No. - How about you bring them to me? - No, no. I'll save them for you. - You write two letters and send only one? - Yeah. - [laughs] Unbelievable! - Don't laugh at me. - What do you mean? I'm not laughing. - You know. [chuckles] Okay, no more laughing. [chuckles] [birds singing] [gentle music playing] [chuckles softly] [sighs] [exhales deeply] [Sedat] Musa, we gotta get going. [construction noises in distance] We have to get there on our own, right, Nuriye? No, I borrowed a friend's car. I'll be happy to drop you off. - Ah. - So you'll go to school with me, okay? They'll say goodbye at the station. And Nebahat? İremnaz, that's my neighbor's daughter, she takes care of her whenever I'm out. - She should be here any minute. - Good. Um, I'll be just outside. Okay, I'll be right with you. [door opens] [door closes] Hello? Nafiz. How are you? Today I'm on duty. Huh? I'm working on a case. That's why I couldn't answer. Just wait... Wait. What the hell are you sending people over to my house for? That's just bullshit. [construction noises continue] I'm ready. [somber music playing] [hydraulics hissing] [engine revving] [indistinct announcement over PA] Musa. You're sure you're okay? It's fine. I'll be okay. Got here kind of early, didn't we, Nuriye, huh? Should we go sit over there for a while? - There? - That's fine. Here's good. Some tea would be nice, huh? - Tea? - Yes, thanks. [indistinct background clamor] [somber music plays gently] [inhale echoes] [exhale echoes] You take care of yourself, now. I will. Count on it. Yesterday, while talking in the garden, I tried to apologize to you, but I couldn't. It's okay. - Since we have this occasion... - Don't worry, I get it. - It's not that important. - It is. Very important. I need to say this, so if you want, don't listen. This isn't actually about you, really. There's this guy who's locked up, told me this story about his boy. And when I say boy, I mean an adult. A real troublemaker. Always messing things up. Osman was always worried about what would happen to the likes of him. And one day, he says... "He's my baby, he's my son." "To provide for, and to save from all danger." "Your task?" "'Protect the kid.'" "There's nothing more." To be a real father, your child has to thrive. Or being a man has no meaning. If you're not able to do that... to protect your own child, that is not a man. I couldn't watch you grow up. The problems you've had that you couldn't tell me. When I think of all the creeps and the... and the assholes that have hassled you, just because your father wasn't around to protect you... But you had the guts all along to handle it. You must've been frightened. You must've been so frightened. But you hid your fear from everyone. Musa. It's my boy. My Musa! - Tell me that it's... That it's... - [Musa] It's me! [chuckles] It's me. It's me, Mother, it's me. [crying] Musa. [Musa sighs] Oh... Uncaring grandparents... Led to believe that your father was dead... Realizing that your papa was still breathing, in prison... You're home. And that's it. [Musa] My beautiful mother! My boy, I... I tried to help her, but I wasn't able. Now you can help me. [sobbing softly] Who? Who couldn't you help, Mother? Yon... Yonca. [shuddering breath] My sweet granddaughter. [cries] Mother, look at me. Look me in the eyes. What happened to Yonca, huh? What happened, Mother? Mother, tell me. [music intensifies] That's my girl. You don't know how glad I am. I don't get it. Who are you, huh? [music begins fading] [sobbing softly] [no audible dialogue] Can you please tell me, what's your real name? [Nuriye] Musa, what's gotten into you? You're babbling, son. Explain yourself. Musa! - Thanks. You can go now, really. - [Sedat] Musa? [Nuriye] Musa. - [crying] - [Musa] It's okay. Go on. You can go. Musa, stop it. - What is wrong with you? - Okay, leave it. It's all right. No, no, don't cry. - [Nuriye] Musa, please calm down. - Don't cry. All right, go on. Go. This conversation's over. We have a bus to catch. Come on. Sedat, please be honest with me. What are you talking about? That's your daughter. Think about it. You come home after being locked up, and your memories have faded, that's all. You tell me where my daughter is. Please, you have to let me explain, Musa. Something happened to my daughter, Nuriye. - Tell me where my daughter is. - It's time to move on. - That's enough. - Where is my daughter, Yonca? Where is she? Where is she?! [Sedat] Your daughter's right over there. - Calm down. - [Musa] That girl isn't my daughter. Nuriye, tell me the truth about her. What truth is that, huh? Is what he's saying... Go ahead. [melancholic music playing] [sobbing softly] [weeping softly] [sniffling] [sniffles, sighs] [sobbing] [crying] [Nuriye] When Yonca arrived here she had already withdrawn into herself. I wrote to you, remember? She didn't speak for a long time. Nebahat always took care of her. And that made her happy. But you know how Nebahat is. You understand it wasn't simple. I took a photo of Yonca and had it framed. So that Nebahat could remember her. I put it away just before your arrival. But of course, she found it. I was careless. I was stupid. Whatever we did was useless. We told her you were alive and in prison. She told people you were dead. The child was so angry. Always so angry. I couldn't even get her to go to school. She refused. It was bad. By then, she was seeing some junkie from the neighborhood. She sold Yonca a dose, told her she'd forget all her troubles. Showed her how to shoot up. By the time I caught on, she was addicted. It was too late. I was so desperate, Musa. We tried everything possible. She spent weeks locked in her room. It didn't work, plus she owed money. The boys and Apo told her she was going to have to hustle. I said no, that I'd go instead. He didn't accept. "Hey, don't worry," he said. She'll just... She'll just deal. [somber music playing] [Nuriye] Musa. You must trust me, Musa, look. Believe me, I only did this to spare you the heartbreak. My intent was only to save you from any more torment. The truth, Nuriye. [somber music intensifies] [Nuriye] One night, she went out to sell drugs. She never came back. Believe me, I waited and waited for her. Must have dozed off. I was cursed with a deep sleep. [somber music continues] She was already dead when I got there. No one bothered to check on her. Not a single one of those bastards called for help. [no audible dialogue] [sniffles] - So how did it happen? - [Nuriye] I just don't know. I swear to you, I asked all around, everywhere. I learned nothing. Apo told me to just leave it. And stop investigating. "You bury her," that's what I told him. "And this stays between me and you." Why? I had you to protect. If you'd heard, you would've surely got involved. You might never have been released from prison. [sniffles] - Apo kept his promise. - [Sedat sighs] No one interfered. Neither the police nor the court. A quiet funeral. I did everything by the book, Musa. [tense music builds] So the guy realizes somethings stinks. He learns that Apo has forced his daughter into prostitution. The girl goes AWOL and has been missing since. Musa comes up to you, he pops right up out of nowhere. Okay. [papers rustling] So after that, he approaches you, and all of the sudden he headbutts you. At this point, you feel dizzy. Then he takes away your gun, right? He hits you in the head and knocks you out. "The subject was gone by the time I came to, I found out what he had done only later." This is the statement you made to the police. Right, it's true. - [Sedat] Musa, don't do it. - [Nuriye] Oh, God. [Sedat] Let's get on the bus and leave. - [Nuriye] Musa. - Musa! Let go of me. Just think about it. I have to. Stop, I beg you. Please don't do this. - [Nuriye sighs] - Stay here. - Either shoot me, or step aside. - [Nuriye] Sedat. [inspector 1] Any changes you wish to make? None. [inspector 1] You didn't know where he was going or his intentions, correct? No, I didn't have a clue. Please. Don't do it. - Musa! - What now? Be sure you come back. - [Sedat grunts] - [Nuriye gasps] [groans] I'm grateful. [Nuriye] Musa. Musa! [grunts] [inspector 2] Something doesn't quite add up here. Like how? What are you saying? The prisoner's motive is that his daughter was forced into prostitution. But we have no evidence of this. All we have is the testimony of a woman by the name of Nuriye Çataklı. The prisoner's daughter, Yonca Solak, is missing. Following the incident, she disappeared. Maybe never existed. And then you asked to retire just before the incident, the reason being that your daughter's getting married in Rome. Sure, the groom is rich. But like you said, the parents of the girl must also contribute something to the proceedings, is that right? Yeah. But it seems like you two are implying something. You're missing the point. All that I expect is some help piecing things together in this goddamn story. You really expect me to believe all that? And all that pathetic crap about your retirement bonus and your daughter's wedding? Look, I'm sorry. But my retirement bonus has nothing to do with my daughter's wedding. Yes, it does. Of course, it does. - What exactly are you saying? - [bangs desk] Shut up! Silence! Sedat, maybe you see me as ignorant or stupid or something. Or is it because you think we're a bunch of beat cops? - [inspector 1] Come on, Sedat. - [inspector 2] Talk to us! I burned some bad people. I subtracted some funds. [inspector 2] Hmm. I believe a father has to stand up for his child. I've done everything I can to protect her. I'm sure we've made mistakes. [cigarette case closes] - [lighter clicks] - [chair creaks] [inhales deeply] We're not experts in psychology and we don't always have the right solutions. University was a must for her. She was always going on about it. Unfortunately, she didn't study. She didn't want to put in the work. She was unable to get admitted. For my daughter, it was a terrible disaster. I sent her to Ankara to a private institution. Where she could attend classes and stay in a dorm. [sighs deeply] I'm a guard in a prison. - Do you have kids? - I do. - Yeah. - [Sedat] So you can understand. Money was scarce. [sighs] College tuition, expenses... things like that. You know how it is. [inhales] I got a second job as a taxi driver in the night club area. I did whatever I could. Borrowed cash. An attempt to make ends meet, and ran up a debt. Put her through the... the final year. She began seeing this boy during her last year. And the two fall in love and decide to get married. This boy has a lot of connections. Real high-society, very rich background. [chuckles softly] A prison is where I work. Menial. Papa the embarrassment. She decides to leave school and rent a house off campus, live on her own. She buys furniture. She's ashamed to be noticed using public transportation, so she rents a car for herself. The bank allows her to take out a loan somehow or other. And, uh... She runs up a huge debt and... I'm told of this only later. By then it's too late. [sighs deeply] I ended up going to Ankara to repair the damage. Now, all I've got... is a prison employee's... retirement. Nothing else. [Musa] Who is she? [Nuriye] Who? The girl? I used to work with her mother at a store. Her dad... went away when she was a baby. [inhales] The poor girl thinks he's coming back. Tell me more about her. - About who? - Yonca. My girl. [somber music plays] You saw her. What do you want to know, Musa? [sighs] Why are you acting like this? What am I supposed to say? You just have to understand. I planned all of this so that you wouldn't get hurt. Do you not care about me, Musa? "Love Me Instead." - What? - The clip. A song. By Tarkan, "Love Me Instead." She sang it all the time. - She did? How so? - Just over and over. "Love Me Instead." - It's a song by Tarkan? - Yeah. You ever listen to it? No. Never. It's a nice song. A really nice video. Of course. It has to be. Wait here. [music fades] [exhales deeply] Stay away from here tonight. Why the pastry store? Did you get something? Huh? Get out of the car. No, I won't. - I don't want to. You can't make me. - Out of the car, Nuriye. Please don't do this, Musa! - Get out of the fucking car! - Stop it! Who do you think I am? [kisses] [horn honks] [upbeat music playing over speakers] [indistinct chatter] Mommy, weren't we supposed to get ice cream? It's too late for that. Hey. I gotta go now. Thank you. [upbeat music continues] [indistinct chatter] Welcome. - Welcome. May God accept your prayers. - Amen. Thank you. Hey, what is it? - Baklava. - [kids laughing] Ah, I don't know how long we can keep this place. He lands this transfer of Demerol for a five-year contract. Gabriel's buddy? Man, those guys don't know what they're doing. Musa? [gunshot] [woman screams] - No! Please, no! Please, no! - [woman] Help! - [gunshot] - Fuck you! [man 1] Run, Ali, run! - [gunshot] - [woman] Get inside! - [gunshot] - [grunts] - [gunshot] - [shouts] [man 2] Musa, the hell are you doing? Have you gone crazy? [Musa] Punishing all those responsible for my daughter's death. What's he doing? - [gunshots] - [shouts] Every single one of you is responsible. - [panting] - [indistinct shouting] - [clamor outside] - What's going on? - Hell if I know. - Someone's shooting up the place. Kaya, go take care of the bastard. On it, sir. And get those kids off the street. Move your asses! [gunshot in distance] [man 3] Who do you think you are, you son of a bitch? - [gunshot] - [grunts] - Musa! Drop it, asshole. - [shouting] He's fucking nuts! - Drop it or you're dead! - [overlapping gunfire] [Musa panting] [ominous music playing] [breathing heavily] I know that you all just stood by and watched as my daughter died. So you just watched, huh? Huh, you fucking whore's bitch?! [indistinct shouts] - [gunshot] - [indistinct shouts] [man 4] Get inside! [man 5 shouting] [Musa panting] Okay. - Got it. Yep. - Okay. - [Sedat] We finished? - [inspector 1] Yes. Thank you. Oh, by the way, the police forgot to have you sign this after your testimony. You also have to sign the back of the page as well. [Sedat] Uh... - Um, here? - [inspector 1] Yes. SUSPECT STATEMENT MISSING CHILD REPORT FORM NAME: YONCA SOLAK FATHER'S NAME: MUSA [somber music playing [sighs] We were supposed to host the ceremony. They didn't even bother asking me for her hand in marriage. Yeah... how come? [lighter snaps shut] You asked... if our family was hosting. It isn't. It seems we're not good enough. My daughter's ashamed of her own father. Well, I'd like to believe that that will change, one day. - Don't worry about it too... - Musa's daughter Yonca is gone. She died a long time ago. Nuriye knew that Musa would react like this, so she came up with a plan. Knowing that the man she loved would go crazy, just like he did. Murat. Ayhan. Go, go. - [gunshot] - [Murat grunts] - [gunshot] - [Ayhan shouts] [Apo panting] Come on, then. Now it's your turn. - [gun cocks] - [panting] Come and meet your Maker. [footsteps approach] [door clangs, creaks] - [gunshot] - [grunts] - [pants] Son of a bitch! - [gunshots] Musa, drop the gun! [dog howling] Don't move! Stop, or I'll blow your head off. [gunshots] - [gunshot] - [gunshots] [groans, grunting] [labored breathing] Who the fuck do you think you are, huh? The hell's your problem? You come into my neighborhood, shoot everyone you see, huh? [Apo breathing heavily] So you think I'm your problem, do you? [shuddering breath] You got the wrong idea, Musa. [sniffs] You're confused. Just calm down. Let's talk it over. I had nothing to do with your daughter. [coughs] [groans, coughs] Listen, Musa. Look at me. Look. I'm putting my gun down. [coughs] Listen to me. Just listen. The girl was under my protection. [shudders] I swear to God. Swear to God. [hacking] [groans] Musa. If you do this, this neighborhood will go hungry, and that includes Nuriye and your mom. [gasps] Listen, Musa. Take a look around you. [groaning, panting] I can give you whatever you like. Anything. Just ask. For me, money is not a problem. I can make you a very wealthy man. [groans loudly] Musa. Why don't you answer?! Musa! You piece of shit! Say something! [sharp, gasping breaths] I promise, you won't serve a single day for what you've done here. I won't let anyone testify against you. [shuddering] When this all blows over, you will be a very rich man. [panting] Please say something. Goddammit... Say something! [gasps, panting] I did everything I could for her. - [gunshot] - [shell casing clatters] [flies buzzing] [groans softly, pants] [groans, pants] [melancholic music plays] - [fire crackling] - [dogs barking in distance] - [helicopter blades thumping] - [indistinct chatter] [Sedat] This whole story... The story that Nuriye and I agreed upon, and told the police and you, it was just a way to save my pension. You didn't have to tell us. The interview was over. It may just be... that I can't live in my shame. That young girl... buried anonymously out there... to keep my retired ass out of trouble. Man can't be expected to just ignore something like that. Am I right, Inspector? [exhales] Nuriye Çataklı knows where she is. [percolating] WE SHOOT EVERY ONE OUT OF THREE PEOPLE WHO ASK FOR FREE TEA P.S.: TWO PEOPLE ALREADY ASKED TODAY [groaning, sighs] [sighs, groans] [club music playing loudly] [music stops] - [shouts, panting] - [clattering] [whimpering] [sobbing] [moaning] [continues sobbing] [crying] [breathing heavily] [sirens wailing] [sirens whooping] [officer] Musa Solak! Drop your weapon and come out! You're surrounded! Musa Solak, surrender! [inspector 1] Do you regret it? You bet. I only wish that I'd, uh... had the guts to go with Musa. That, I regret. [breathes deeply] Should we wrap up? Let's wrap. [taps desk] I guess we're through. You'll be hearing from us. Hmm. I thank you. [shuffling, clattering] [office phone ringing] [officer] Musa, it's over! You don't stand a chance, Musa. [sighs] [groans] [somber music playing] [officer] Drop your weapon. Surrender! This is the last warning. Drop it! [officer 2] Game over, Musa! There's nowhere to go. Drop the gun! Musa, surrender! [rapid gunfire] [shouting] No, no! Stop it! Stop! [crying] Stop it, please! [crying] No! No, please! - Don't die! - [wheezing] [sobbing] Please! [gasps] Leyla is my name. Do you hear me? Leyla. My daughter... [sobbing softly] [weeping] [crying] [sound fades] BACHELOR OF LAWS LEYLA KARTAL So what is this story? Why are you disappearing? - Disappearing, are you kidding? - [Sedat laughs] Don't think you can get rid of me that easily, not in this lifetime. - [Gülendam] Well... - [Sedat] Hmm. For example, I have tons of stuff to prepare. Where I worked, where I did my internship, they offered me a job. - [Gülendam] Wow, fantastic! - Hey! - That's amazing! - We'll see what happens. What do you mean, "we'll see?" You know how difficult it is to find employment? And here you have an offer. Don't think twice about it. Deep down, they don't want you to leave. - [Gülendam] It's not like that. - Of course, it is. [chuckles] - Uncle Sedat snatched away my diploma. - It's right up there, staring at us. - So I can't do anything even if I leave. - Your diploma's ours. Hey. What about a toast to our graduate? - [Sedat] Hear, hear! - [Gülendam] Oh, yes. - Here's to your success and your health. - A happy life to you, my darling. I wish you much happiness. To Papa. I had only one day to get to know you, but to you, I will always be thankful. I will strive to honor you. [Gülendam] Of course you will, sweet girl. - I forgot the dessert, I'll go get it. - [Gülendam] Okay. To Musa. [glasses clink] [Sedat] Here we are, the king of desserts. - [Gülendam] You can't serve it in a box. - It'll be just fine. Would you move that, please? Leyla goes crazy for this. The guy in town, the one who makes these, he's an absolute genius. - Enjoy, everyone. - It's unpresentable this way. Sure, I know. Nuriye will be telling everyone about how you serve everything in a box. - [Sedat] What are you talking about? - Come on! - That's something I'd never do. - Nuriye should know us by now. - [Gülendam] That's the point. - Never mind. Just help yourselves. - [Nuriye] This is my favorite dessert. - You're joking. I had no idea. Well, help yourself. - I bought it 'cause I know Leyla loves it. - [Nuriye] I go mad for this too. - I had to order this a week ago. - [Leyla] This tastes amazing. [Sedat] I'm telling you, he's a genius. There are lines around the block This has got to be the very best in Konya. [Nuriye] My grandmother used to make this during religious festivals. [Sedat] My mother, may she rest in peace, used to make something very similar. - It was so good! - [Gülendam] I think I know what you mean. [Sedat] You remember, what's it called? TO ZEYTİNKÖY... [acoustic guitar music playing] [woman singing] [upbeat song playing [vocalizations] [music ends]
