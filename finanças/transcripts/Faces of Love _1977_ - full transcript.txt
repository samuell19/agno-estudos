Tomorrow I'll go to Bex. "Be" What? The pronunciation is "Be", not "Bex". Like sheeps? I see Bex, I say "Bex". Anyway, let's go. Tomorrow I'll go to Bex. Two errors in the same word. One about time, one about gender. Definite and feminine. As far as I know, you're not a woman, my dear Victor. Please correct it. I'll spend the night... at the Salines Hotel. I'm delighted to do this movie. I hope it'll be good. What will be the subject of your film? The story of the Three sisters, according to Chekov. Speak Russian, damnit! The Three Sisters is already complicated. I would be confused. What do you mean? It's difficult. I'm still working on the landmarks. I'm looking for the landscapes. I write everything in that notebook. The milkman's blue notebook. Blue blue. Blue lake. Julie's blue eyes. Blue Bex's night and Blue Rh?ne. Blue ink. Salines. Salt. Tears. 2nd July 1904. Lord Anton Chekov. But... are you all crazy? It's a mistake. I asked for a passengers' wagon. Not a goods train. Sorry, Madam, I follow the orders. It's written here. "Deliver a goods train so as to carry the dead body of Sir A. Chekov, writer." Don't touch me! Anyone could help me carry him? Are you deaf? I asked someone to help me. How many times shall I tell you? Leave it to me! Don't take him! I forbid you, he's mine! What if the whole world collapses in a flood of stones ? What if the whole world collapses in a flood of stones ? I didn't say anything. Here is the man. Victor? Victor the Nice. Victor the Great. I'm pleased to meet you. I'm C?cilia. Did I frighten you? You can shake my hand, you know. I didn't know you wanted me to kiss you. You never knew what I want, Victor. You never knew. You're covered with lipstick. It must be... C?cilia. The Italian girl. I see, they are here. I'm the last one. No, Esther hasn't arrived yet. She was born after the war. Hello. My name is Esther. I'm 20. Actually 22, but I don't like it. I prepared something but... I don't know anymore. Yeah... I wrote to you because... I'd be happy to work with you and... I can't write so... Here I am in front of the recorder sending you a videotape. That's what I do. I wanted to tell you that... I'm happy to do this character because... I haven't read the Three sisters. I don't know Chekov so it's interesting to... To know it because of... I will cut. You're three Ladies, aren't you? Are you surprised? - I think it's natural. - I don't. Three gentlemen would be natural. Three Ladies together is rare. One would wonder why. We may not wonder. We can leave the question for later. Let's leave it for later. It's better. Why? Don't you answer? Am I bothering you? Not at all. You're amusing. That's new. I amuse Julie now! Esther, C?cilia, please leave us alone. Careful... ! Please, Julie. If you want to talk for me I give you the floor. No way. You are the male. Do you know that... Julie was my wife. 10 years ago. That's why... The male. I didn't know. It's good news. What about Esther? I'm listening to you. That's true. I was his wife. Ten years ago. Ten years. Can't you see it? Can't you? One may ask why do women age faster than men? Or we can do like Victor. Leave the question for later. Like an ostrich or a dead. Maybe we could change the topic. I hate ostriches. I hate death too. That relationship explain our friendship... our proximity... That's it. Julie? It's me, Victor. Julie? Are you here? Julie, open! It's me. I'll come back. Think about it. You bitch! I'll get you. That's what we need. The house is great. Everything is perfect. It's perfect for our film. - You think so? - Yes I do. We will just put away the furniture. We need it different. What? Put away the furniture? What about us? Where will we go? How will we live? Do you want us to keep standing? Don't worry, Mister. We will rent you a room during the shoot. Can we bring some stuff? Madam, take whatever you want. We're not at war. ??? No. Why? You have aspirin. My head aches when I rehearse. When I stay with strangers... - But you know me. - Oh, you... But all the other ones make me stiff. Don't they? I'm trying not to have feelings. Finally, I love money. I can't stop thinking about it. Money. Don't you? Oh, me... You don't think about it? Sometimes I do. More for Baptiste than for me. We're having a great life. This was a good year. I worked a few months. Now your project. Where does he can when you're working? Your son ? Yes. Baptiste. He goes part-time to the boarding school. Didn't I tell you? No you didn't. And when you're acting? - He stays home. - Alone? Yes. Alone. Please Victor. Don't do this to me. Don't worry, it's not money. Time goes by... Time flies away. And time stops. So many time... My child... My son... The girls are funny. I wonder what they are talking about. C?cilia is conscientious. She's a worker. Probably speaking about Moscow. She says: "You see, Esther..." "Going to Moscow is not a trip" "It's not about visiting another place." "It's about changing our lives." "A try to make a change for a better world." "To become someone new." Every evening, the actors see Moscow. It's a kind of happiness. What do they do in the morning? They stay in their beds. Naked. They are cold. It's a kind of misfortune. You promised not to show up. Then let's go to your room. No one goes to my room. It's only for bedtime. - Let's go to the hotel. - No. I am working here. Bullshit. I saw you. You do nothing. You're the one doing nothing. Just prowling around and bothering us. I'm prowling because I want you. You had me. I still want you. Do it quick and leave. - Right here? - Yes. Why not? What if someone sees us? You're afraid. No. So, what are you waiting for? Leaves are shaking in the wind. I always thought this place would make me think. It makes me sleep. How happy. A little garden in the middle of a bloody desert. How happy... What is happiness? Here, happiness is only happiness. In my country, there are two words. The first one is alegria. Happiness can also be called illusion. Happiness, alegria, illusion... Are they three sisters? No, I was thinking about something else. And me? - C?cilia? - Yes. Why did you think about me? For that character. We needed someone Italian. So the producers offered me the beautiful Cecilia. Offered? Offered. It's also because of the way you work. At least what I imagine. What about your hands? Show me your hand. - Which one? - It doesn't matter. It's unusual that a woman doesn't have a man's hands. And the blondie? Esther. It's youth. We have ideas. But it's only ideas. Actually we don't know. We must watch it. So I watch Esther living. I wonder what she will wear. Don't you dare talking about Julie? I made this film so as to see her again. It's been my move for years. Patiently. It's just a pretext. There a three women. C?cilia the worker. Esther the young. Julie the love. No, there's only one. Do the math. A young hard-working woman I love. Julie. It's me, Victor. We have good sleep here. No cars, no train. Nothing! It's a desert. Is Victor eating in his bed? He always wakes up early, eats and goes walking around. He loves trees and birds. He loves nature. Doesn't he, C?cilia? Those who choose to love will be hit in their heart. What an idea... What's wrong with her? If you ask me what life is... It's like you ask... What is a carrot? One must know that a carrot can be eaten, sucked and digested. And forgotten... C?cilia, have you seen Julie? Where is she? - She was just here. - And now, where is she? All I know is that she was here. I saw her leaving. By the door? I suppose. Did she look fine? Totally. She didn't drink and didn't talk much. What did she say? She talked about your love for trees and birds. What? Did her eyes... moved like this? Like a twitch. I didn't notice. Are we in a clinic? Julie was ??? She'll be back soon. What can I do for you? Give me some Lipunaire 3 please. Sure. May I see your prescription? I'm in holydays. I didn't bring my prescription. Sorry Madam, but I need the prescription. - Oh, please. - You said Lipunaire 3, right? I can give you something similar. No, I'm used to this brand and I don't want to change. Try a French pharmacy. Is French far away? Only 30 km. Just cross the Rh?ne. Thanks, it's very kind of you. I'm very thirsty. I'll have tea. It will be served soon. I was married at 18. I was afraid of him. He was a teacher. I just finished my studies. He seemed a real scientist to me, a very important one. Now... alas... - Now it's different. - Yes... I'm used to my husband. But amongst the others. Mostly civilian... So many men are crude and rude. I can't stand crudeness. I suffer... when I meet a man without fineness... without kindness... without gentleness. When I'm in the middle of... teachers - my husband's friends... I suffer. - Literally. - Yes... If you listen to a intellectual speaking... He will stay he's bored of his wife, his house... his ownerships, his horses... It's weird. Russian are inclined to the high thoughts of "Why our life is stuck at such a low standard of living?" - Why? - Why? Why is he bored of his children and his wife? And why are his children and his wife bored of him ? I complain to you... Don't bear me a grudge. There is only you. I'm alone, you're my only one. What was that sound? When father died... I heard this sound. Exactly the same. - Are you superstitious? - Yes. You are a wonderful woman. Marvelous. Wonderful... Marvelous... Everything is shadow but your eyes shine. It's bright here. I love... I love... I love... I love your eyes! You're the movement I'm dreaming of. You are a wonderful woman. Marvelous. When you call me this way, I don't know why it makes me laugh. Tell him I'm afraid. Please don't call me this way anymore. Then... Leave. I don't care. No, I don't care. Or... Tell me something else. You are a wonderful woman. Marvelous. Wonderful. Marvelous. You're the movement I'm dreaming of... Here you are! Where were you? You disappeared. I was in my room. It's curious. I saw you running in the park. Heading to the gate. You're probably right. Sorry I'm late. You started without me. Yes. We have rehearsed a scene you are not involved in. Not involved in? Is there such a scene? Let's go ahead with that scene. Let's work. I can be the movement you're dreaming of too. Me too... Esther, C?cilia, Julie... What is a woman? Could it be an image? A woman? It's difficult to say. I must think about it. It's someone who seems different to a men. Because of her round bosom and flat sex. Her legs, her beardless face. Someone a men see wrong because of these. It's someone a men sit with like he's going to eat her. It's someone in a men's plate. A woman? It's a fragile person. To whom men feel physical attraction. Like Esther said. However... this physical attraction... is mixed with thoughts. Animated by it. So mind and mind are inseparable? Exactly. They are one. One's pleasure is the other one's pleasure. What about you Julie? What do you think? You know I never think. Don't you have an idea? I have no idea. You're just living? Yeah, I live. It's already a lot. Do you doubt it? - Do you doubt it? - No. C?cilia, do you doubt I'm living? You see, you're the only one who doubt I'm living? It's my turn to ask some questions. I won't ask Esther if she's living, it's obvious. It would be insulting. At her age, it's what everyone do. Life is still a long way. It's comprehensible for someone so nice. I'm not pretty. I said nice, not pretty. C?cilia, do you think you're living? Yes. My life is an adventure. I enjoy it. You have an affair. No. You have affairs. No. I don't need it. I have... others passions. You forgot to live. No, I just love my job. You're afraid to live. You're afraid to burst. So you take precautions. Going step by step... Studious... Devoted... I'm not afraid to burst. I just have self-control over my mind. And I'm devoted to no one. I think about me first. I, I, I, I, I... You're boiling, C?cilia. You will burst someday. You will see. I don't like sexual affairs. It's the only thing I like. Please, ladies... - We are here to work. - We are working. We're making things clear. We need it for a good work. I think Esther fucks too much and C?cilia not enough. What is the connection with the film? That's why you chose us. It's all about fuck. It's because of fuck. In spite of fuck. You and us are one. Me and you are four. You never really loved women, Victor. You can't stand us being accomplice. So you're making us enemies. Then you're reassured. You're the boss again. You can't... understand that a man and a woman must be one. It's must be only one. Is it too easy for you? It make 2. It makes 3. It makes 4. One is love. Two is arrangement. Three is... problems. Four is loneliness. I'm leaving you. What a sad weather. We have nothing in common. Neither our tastes nor our desires. Nothing. We were together like machines. Every week at the same time. Like a robot. On Tuesday or Wednesday. On Tuesday more often. Don't you look at me? Are you listening to me? You smelt good. That's it. You smelt good. A smell that was always in my mind. It was haunting me. I'm bored of this light. It's blinding. The shadow... Are you Catholic or Protestant? Mystery... One sugar or two? Mystery... Sea or mountain? Mystery... You are totally unknown. There was this light the first time I saw you. Shadow... Your skin was kind of blue. Blue is a cold color. I know... I'm not a poet. Poets always have a bandage on their head to heal their scar. I only have a hat. This music... It's moving away. It leave us alone to restart our lives. We must live. We must! The day will come we will know why. Why those sufferings. There won't be no mystery. But we must live. And work and work! The music is so proud, so cheerful... And we should live. God... Time will pass... We will leave forever and we will be forgotten. Our number will be too. But our sufferings will become joy for our descendants. Happiness and peace will be on Earth. And shit! Shit! Shit! I sound like a priest and I hate this position. What do I look like with her? It's so old-fashioned. We?re doing as Chekov himself wrote. Look, it's written. I don't care about it! All I want is a good text. And I need to feel free to accomplish this. Respect won't bar my way. Let's start again. No head on my chest anymore. We will have a kind word for those who are living. We will bless them. Oh! Dear sisters. Our life is not over. It will go on! The music is so proud, so cheerful... And we would live... So great! God! So great! - I'll talk to her. - No, let's go ahead. Go ahead without me. C?cilia, stay here! We'll go on without her! C?cilia! I order you to stay here! C?ci... You're fired! You're all fired! The two of us go on! The day will come we will know why. Why those sufferings. There won't be no mystery. But we must live. But we must live! - We must live... - Go ahead. I don't know. It's easy. Waiting for the end of our sufferings... The work! The work! It's what I'm doing! Working! Your fights prevent me from a goof work. I know everything about your relationships and secrets. I feel like a child in a middle of adults. What? - You and Julie for example. - There's nothing between us! Everything is clear. And there's nothing with C?cilia too. Julie can't grow up. She can't stand her face. I'm bored of the girls. - Which girls? - All of them. - I'm leaving too. - Where to? I don't need to know yet. What about me? - What? You?! - Yes, me. What will I do? Don't you think I'm bored of the three of you? What if I'm the one leaving? - What would you do? - It's your problem. Let go of me. Don't take advantage. Let go of me or I will shout. Shout then. How sweat you are, C?cilia. You should have married. You would be like me now. It was this or that. Could you give me my mirror? It's in my bag near the window. Yes, it's always this or that. Instead of this and that. What a pity. How scary I am. How scary... We are alike. I'm scary too. Esther is definitely the only beauty. Definitely. Are you jealous? Not at all. I have a bit a regrets. Just a bit. She reminds me of the rime I lost. The wrong use. The old fag can't stand Victor's attitude with her. He doesn't care about what she says. No matter how she plays. He doesn't care. Only her face makes him happy. Irina's character must be a young girl. Yes, but not a dumb one. Who says she's dumb? I know Victor. He likes dumbness. He thinks he can think for two. He is overwhelming. He lives in you, occupies you and destroys you. One must keep his distances. Follow his survival feelings. I know. I was his wife. Your hands are beautiful. Everything would be better with my medicines. But I took it all and can't find some at the pharmacy. Lupinaire 3 means nothing to them. Nothing. Without it I feel... rotten. Someone could find it in France. But who? Don't tell to Victor. Even if I'm weak. He will be happy. Your mouth is beautiful too. Why should we heal from love? You should learn to take a deep breathes. Breathing is very important. Your chest too. I love tiny tits. And your shoulders, and your hips, and this... And your navel! Show me your neck. Turn around. Here. Your back... No, you won't see this part. We are two lonely wives. And hot. - Warm. - If you want. We need a man. Clearly. Confess you needed my car. It's true. Only you have one. - And me? Don't you need me? - I do. I need you to drive me. And buy something in France. What is it? Guess... A child. No. I know. Name it. You wanted to be with me. You and me alone. Look. What do the plates look like? What do we look like? Two orphans. We'd better order the meal and forget them. They won't be long. Long? Why would they be long? I think they are long because they aren't back yet. Congratulations! Back from...? France. They looked for Lupinaire. I can't trust you. You can't keep a secret. It's for your good. Why do people always want to do good? It took a whole day to find a pharmacy. What a joke. Such a play: "Victor and Esther look for Lipunaire". What if I lied? What if it doesn't exist? Your devotion would throw you all into shame. Why would you have lied? So as to... know Victor's feelings for me. And for Esther. Precisely. You can't rely on a medicine to prove his feelings. I can. Victor doesn't care about my health. He just wants to sleep with Esther. What do you mean sleep with her? I don't know anymore. If Chekov was here... He would say: "We always talk about love". "But we don't love much." Chekov... He's like this plate. If it fell on the floor. It's not a plate anymore. Just a bit of clumsiness and... broken. It's not what it used to be anymore. Feel this heart beating for you. We should call C?cilia and Julie. They shouldn't wait. - What should I tell them? - The truth. We went to Dostoyevsky. - It was them. - Yes. They'll come later. They are still in Saxon-les-Bains. They must be swimming... I'm fed up with this. Breathe deeply. I'm fed up... Today I saw... a very unusual bird. Green and red. What is it? A pic. A pic-vert. A green and red pic. Stop these idiocies C?cilia. I'm serious. I'm serious too. I will stab Victor when he arrives. Don't play with this. I didn't mean it. Give it to me. I'd rather die. May I? Cheers. It's always the same. Partying. A fiesta. Watch my boy. He'll bang her. Victor... Are you angry? No. I needed fresh air. I'm sick of noise and smoke. I couldn't refuse to dance. - Don't you agree? - Sure. Don't be ridiculous. - Go back in and enjoy. - Not without you. Let's go for a walk. So let's go. Come on. Let's go. I haven't paid yet. It doesn't matter. You had it wrong. I danced with him so as to arouse your attention. I want you. Now. I can't. I'm in love with Julie. I didn't mean it. I know, I know. It's nothing. Just clumsiness. I'm nothing compared to C?cilia and Julie. I needed to exist, play a role too. Stay away or I shoot! Sorry, I thought it was someone else. I am someone else. I bet you it's him. I've already seen his face. Sorry to disturb you... Are you the one on the TV? Yes, sometimes. See that Jos?? He's the singer! No Sir, I'm no singer. Actor. You are an actor? Yes, I am an actor. Acting for TV, cinema and theatre. Mister Rocher, isn't it? I remember now. Your name is Rocher. No Madam, not Rocher. Jean Vallet. Double L. Like the two L... in "valley". Tell me: where is the Salines Hotel please ? On the other side of the city. Going back to the top. See? I see, thank you. Thanks. Miss. Keep the change. As you can see, artists wake up early. And sleep late... He isn't a worker? He is two, at the same time. He wears his roles like others wear clothes. Yesterday, he was... Tomorrow... Tomorrow who will he be? Come on, tell me! Tomorrow... Tomorrow is like today. Exactly. It's like today. Days pass and look alike. A woman wakes up. She's like yesterday. She sleeps and the day after, she is like today. That's life. However, time passes... and put a grey veil on her hair. Imperceptibly. A shadow... Like a bird hiding the sun. Beauty... Destitution... That's all we know. Open your misfortunes... This is what we are enduring... When the time will come... We will die in resignation. Over there behind the grave... It will say we've suffered. We have cried. Our life was bitter. May God have mercy on us. And our lives will be beautiful, clear and exquisite. We will be delighted. And we will cast a moved glance at our past sorrows. Smiling with compassion. Then we will rest. The text you just heard was from Anton Chekov's. Let's do this scene again. Don't forget: put your voice on the text with lightness. Remember Ambrosio's fingers on the piano. Here is Dr Baumann. I have been told to introduce myself to you for a role. So, here I am. Am I disturbing? Was there an accident? No, why? Why do you think so? Your hand is stripped. And the Lady in her bed. The direction... She needs some rest. That's all. How did you find us? I read the newspapers. I thought it would be good to come. What for? I told you. The role. Are you really an actor? Yes. I am acting for TV, cinema and theater. A dramatic artist. You're playing Three sisters. We are the sisters. Here is Elina. Nasha. I am Olga. It's the best day of my life. I never thought I would meet you. I never thought I would approach so beautiful women. I'm troubled. I wish you a speedy recovery. May your work be successful? Forgetting the handicap of a stripped hand... a broken leg and... anything else. I'm sorry to be rude but I can't hire you just because you came here by train. Who mentioned a train? I mentioned consideration. I came here to offer you my service. I'm not claiming. No begging. - Nothing. - It is not possible. First, we will shoot in a month. Also, you're not the type. The role is 60. It has nothing to do with age. When Chekov died at 40 he seemed 60. Make-up will do. You are not Chekov. Right. What if I ask for no wage? Free of charge! I don't decide. - But who? - Producers. Where are they? More than 500 km away. 500 km... Shit... What do I do? You just leave us work. And... have a drink at the bar. It's on me. Would you allow me to play a scene for you? I can't refuse but there is no way you get the role. It's for somebody else. Just a little, tiny one. Fast... Chekov's life instant! His death. Champagne. I've never had it. What a death! Amazing. Really amazing. You can get up now. Stop this comedy. Is he dead? Go get a doctor. Julie, give me your mirror. No steam... He's dead. There is no steam. He must be dead. It's a real lesson of love. We speak, and speak... But we don't love much. Are you afraid? Don't want to be seen naked? My body has changed in 10 years. - I've aged too. It's normal. - Yes, but I prefer you not to see. Let's Kiss, Julie. Not now. They are waiting for us. We should go. - I wanna make love. - Me too. Believe me I need it. But not today, it's been such a day... Let me breath. I'm so happy, Victor. So happy... You can say it. But you are not forced. You decide: do I say it or not ? - Then say it. - Ok. Silence! We are gonna shoot! Watch out! The Three Sisters. 73 - 1st. Music! When our time will come... We will die in resignation. Over there behind the grave... It will say we've suffered. We have cried. Our life was bitter. May God have mercy on us. And our lives will be beautiful, clear and exquisite. We will be delighted. And we will cast a moved glance at our past sorrows. Then we will rest.
