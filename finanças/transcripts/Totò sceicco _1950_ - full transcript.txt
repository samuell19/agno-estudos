If the Marquis is not there, perhaps there is his wallet. - Nothing. - There is not? - No. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry the Marquis isn't here . Remember, honesty above all! &lt;Gastone, are you awake? I'm the mommy. - The marquise. Poor woman! Mother of a dissolute son! It is so thin! Too strong a blow would crush it. - Go, leave me alone with her. - Yes, Mr. Antonio. Poor mother! Gastone! - Antonio. - Good morning, Madame Marquise. Where is the young gentleman? - Antonio, what's underneath? - There's nobody under the bed. Not even in the drawers. Maybe it's in the closet. Enough, I understood the sad truth. Gastone spent the night away from home with that woman! How I suffer! - Antonio, leave me alone. - As you like, Marquise. THUND As usual! I said too much pain would crash her ... - The armchair. - What pain! I believe it, Marquise. WHISTLE I know. SOUND OF THE HORN - I never thought I'd suffer so much. - I know. Never ... never so much. Thanks, Ludovico. - (MARCHESA) Let's go. - Close the door. - Hoist the marquise. - How I suffer. How I suffer! What a pain! He spent the night with Lulu, the entertainer! - How disgusting! - That woman bewitched him.

My Gastone! - Gastone, calm down. - No, I'm tired! - Then go back to your mother. - I will do it. - Well, leave me to my theater and my admirers! - Lovers! - No, fans! If they were admirers, they wouldn't let you kick around in front of empty armchairs! - Empty chairs? - Yup! - My number is a triumph! - Everyone sings my song. - All your lovers! Stop it, otherwise I'll break your head! - Instead I repeat: Your lovers! - Stop that! Who knows if I'm home. I'm home. Ludovico, wait for me, I'll be right back. - Coward, scoundrel! - I kill you! - Give it a go! - You make me Crazy! - That's enough! KNOCK ON THE DOOR - Who is it? It is you! Well, a witness. Everyone must know that she is cheating on me! She must know he says he 's a gentleman, instead he is a coward and a scoundrel! - Tell him he's tired me! - Okay, I'll report. Here's the thanks for giving her my all! - And something about Mom too. - It's true. I squandered a fortune for her. - You understand it because you have a heart in here ! - Yup. - You got it? - Yes. - I know! Tell him to leave now! - I hate it! Tell him to leave, or I'll take his eyes out like that - Aah! "The light that went out"! Michele Strogoff, "The troika". Keep your gifts, I don't want them! Gee, I see! Good night. I don't see any more. Marchesino, your mother sent me here to tell you ... Tell him you can take this apartment back and that he will never see me again. He is a scoundrel and a coward! It will be served. The young lady begs me to tell her that you are a scoundrel and a coward. - Walk the young lady to the door! - Immediately. Yes, I'm going away. Goodbye! Arrivederla. - She's gone? - Yes, sir. - Why did you let her go? - She told me. How unhappy I am! I kill myself! - What work is "La traviata"? - No. - "The Barber of Seville". - No, I'll get it over with! Yes, get it over with. - Get over it! - No, I want to die! To die? To die! He'd be bored all day underground, alone with worms. There are 'wisps', but only on Sundays. The other days always closed in "cash". Marquis, desist, do not insist. It would be a dead life that is not suitable for her. - You're right, killing yourself is cowardice. - Sure. Antonio, do you love me? Well ... yes. - You've been serving us for 20 years, haven't you? - Yup. Then kill me. - Huh? - You kill me. - What's this? We don't play jokes! - Marquis! - Shoot me. Excuse me, but you are stupid. - Shoot, it's an order! - Think. - Pull the trigger! - But what if I hurt her? If you don't kill me, I'll kill you. No, you don't kill me. I'm counting to three. If you didn't shoot on three , I'll shoot! - One! - Y ... Y ... Yeah, y ... I'll shoot. Mr. Marquis, give ... where do you want the bullet? - To the heart! Two! - Cu ... cu ... heart. - Where is the heart, right or left? - Three! - Shooting! - Shoot. - Thanks, Antonio. Pre ... pre ... please, Marquis. Excuse me, Mr. Marquis, I must faint. Everyone betrays me. There are no joys in life. You too, servant, slave, why do you live? I `ll kill you. No! I don't love me ... SHOOT Follow your fate, I will follow mine. Alone! Shame. Shame! - Didn't you try to hold him back? - Yup. We "fought". There was a "mouthwash". - Forgive me, but suddenly "I haven't seen any more". - So? When I saw him again, he had gone away with Ludovico. Where did he go, poor son! - How I suffer! - No, for heaven's sake! Here is Ludovico. Where is Gastone? Where did you accompany him? - He enlisted. - Enlisted? - Yes, in the Foreign Legion. In the Foreign Legion! But I will not abandon him. I cannot abandon my son. - Do you want to ARRIVE too? - No, you will. - I? - Yes, you will follow him, you will watch over his life and you will bring him back to me safe and sound. You will leave immediately. - Will you allow me a word? - Yup. - Can I speak without reticence? - Without reticence. - Then I say no. - No? - Yes. - What does that mean? It means no. Nerd. Antonio, you have been stealing from this house for 25 years . - Does the marquise know? - Everybody knows. - Oibò. Okay, I confess. I have been stealing for 25 years. But I did it to do good. I helped an orphan, without a mother, without a father, without a roof. Who is this poor orphan? Who is this orphan? But ... marquise. - It's me. - You? - Yup. Do I have a dad? Do I have mom? Is this building mine? - Antonio, I want to move to the countryside. - Yup. If you bring my son back safe and sound , I'll give you this palace - with all the furniture inside. - Really? - Yup. - This building? - Yes. - Then I'll leave right away. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - I knew I could count on you. - Will you save him? - Sure. If I think that Gastone is alone in that desert, I suffer terribly. How much do I suffer! No! I will go to suffer in the countryside. Brava, there are the stone benches , she can suffer as she wants. - Yes. Ludovico, let's go. - Goodbye. How do you join the Foreign Legion? - It's simple, go to Caffè Verdi in Via del Porto. - And then? He sits down and orders beer and sausages. - But what if I have no appetite? - That's the watchword. Ah understood. Can you give me a ride with the car? Willingly, but I have to accompany the marquise to the villa. - But I can take your suitcase to the café. - (IN FRENCH) Thank you. - Did you learn French? - Sure, I have to go to the Foreign Legion! (IN FRENCH) Goodbye, my little cabbage. But did I say right? "Caffè Verdi in Via del Porto" or "Caffè Porto in Via Verdi"? APPLAUSE # The woman changes every moment.

Rudolph Valentino has already done it. You did not understand. You must take the place of Omar Bei Hussein. My brother. You will lead the desert raiders who will exterminate the Foreign Legion. The Foreign Legion? There is a misunderstanding. But where did I join? Among the desert rebels fighting the Legion. No, I rebel, I will not be a rebel. Let's drink on it and enemies more than before! Unfaithful dog, I'll kill you! - Stop, it's too late. Do you want to be the son of the sheikh? - No. - Then take him to the white cell . - Go there. - I get it. - I am thirsty. - Get up, let's go! - But give me a drink.

I will propose you for a promotion. No ... Major ... Kill him! It is an angry beast! Rest assured, the Sheikh's son will be killed. Presto! Get it. To the infirmary, soon. Poor boy, sunburn, warn the lady. - And the sheikh's son? - Be killed. - You'll die, you ugly raider. - What "praeton"? I am secular, LAICON! My name is Antonio Sapone, a native of Caserta. - (TOGETHER) Caserta? - Yes, the moral capital of Italy. - We do justice ourselves. - As? Guys, let's not joke. What do you want to do? - Let's get his skin off. - What are you doing? It's a leathery! It is an imitation. Help! Stop! - You don't want to kill him like that! - This is a man who thinks. You cannot behave barbarously, we are civilized people. - Take an example from him. - We must act civilly. - These are men! - We'll shoot him with all the rules. A nice shot with all the rules, nice, clean ... Help! They shoot me! - He's waking up. - Gastone, dear, how do you feel? Lulu, love ... Antonio ... - Who is Antonio? - Where is Antonio? - Which Antonio? - The sunstroke! - Calm down, please. The sheikh's son ... Antonio is in danger. Try to rest, dear. Mean me! Mean me! SOUND OF TRUMPET Tapino! - Presentat'arm! - Let them do it, rest! Silence! Bets ... Antonio is in danger, they believe him the son of the sheik! - They're shooting him. - Thing? I have to save him! Petty and tapino! Stop! There is a mistake, he is not the son of the sheikh! - It's Antonio. - He saved my life. He is worthy to be part of our glorious battalion. - I told you I was not the son of the sheikh. - All right. Congratulations, I always thought you couldn't be the sheikh's son. Come here. It sounds. Hey, are you done? (ANTONIO) Are you working overtime? Military! Sorry, I'll come right away. Here we go. - Greedy. - In the desert you don't just thirst for water. (ANTONIO) Shall we start over? - Will you promise me you won't be jealous anymore ? - I'll be a model husband. - Husband? - As soon as my enlistment ends , we'll get married. - Dear. - Then? - Here. - Hello. I've been a sentinel alone for 3 hours . If they found me, they sentenced me to be shot again. - If I think they were going to kill you ... what a laugh! - Yeah. They wanted me ... it was ... it was ... to shoot. They are laughing. "Laughs best who laughs last!" You said: "Me wretched, me mean!" - Miserable, fella! - They took you for the sheikh's son. The sheikh's son, me! Do I have the face of the sheikh's son? How stupid! - Oh God! - What rascal faces ! - Like idiots! The rebels! No rebels! "Ribrutti"! - Sorry. - Nothing. The son of the sheikh ... to me then the sheiks ... the sheikhs ... they always made me sick! - Oh God. - What a face. - There was one ... a stinker. - Oh yes? Speaking of fetentoni ... he was from Bitonto! Mr. Marquis! Mr. Antonio! Alarms! Alarms! # Lulu from the cabaret now it's not you anymore. Alas, you have disappeared from the time of Fru-fru. Only you shone then full of charm and splendor. But progress then changed you and fashion changed. Now she dances in the cabaret, all naked from head to toe. Like, how have you changed, my romantic Lulu. You go all unglued where has your virtue gone? Dance, dance the rasp that comes to us from Paranà. Between the file, the rasp and the crazed toad is humanity. Lulu dance. Sing Lulu. That time that was never returns. But it's always you, Lulu. # Brava. A toast to Lulu and his legionnaire Gastone. Hurray! - What do you want? - The rebels have kidnapped Antonio and Gastone. - (LULU ') Gastone? - Give the alarm! - It's late. Major, we must save him! Those barbarians will kill him! Sorry, there is nothing I can do. We have already had too many losses. I'll go alone, will you at least give me a spare man? Not even one ... but if you just need half, he's there. Half? Better a half man today than a chicken tomorrow. What a magnificent woman! But ... mom! Come on, let's die strong. Mr. Marquis, I'd rather live weak. Mother! This hole is squeezed by my neck, I wear 16 Shut up, unfaithful dogs! You will suffer the punishment intended for traitors. The rebels will use your heads as a target. Allah wants it. - Could one speak to Lord Allah? - You will talk to us soon. Well, among gentlemen you can always have explanations. Marquis, are you talking to this gentleman? Do you speak French, Marquis? Even the butterfly was needed! - Butterflies alight on flowers! - Damn! If I take it, I eat it. You take advantage of it, coward! Incominciate! - Marquis, I hear a sound. - The march of the legionaries! Here are ours! Ours are coming! - Comrades! - To us! Marquis, you can't tell! Legionaries! Colleagues! Colleagues, what are you doing? Are you deaf? Are you blind, dumb of ear? Where are you going? Save us! - I'm sorry, we can't do anything. - Because? Because we are a mirage. Damn this African sun! It's over. Close your eyes, we will die without realizing it. - Goodbye, Antonio. - Farewell, Marquis. - Curse! - There are not! - Where am I? So it was true! Past! Past! Past! Mom! - Mr. Marquis, are you there too? - Yes, Antonio. - Wh ... where are we? - Underground. - Then we're dead. - No, wait, I 'll light a match. - This is a tomb. - Then we're dead. - No, an ancient tomb. - So we're long dead! In fact I felt a stink! - Look, a door! - A door? (ANTONIO) How wonderful! This is a necropolis! A necropolis? We hope to meet a NECROPOLITAN. - (MARQUIS) Look, the cat! - The cat? Atlas! Maybe you don't know, but the cat is the symbol of the ancient Atlantic people. Marquis, I know! How can you not know? Everyone knows, the "Atlantic cat". - No! - Yes, it is. Believe me. - What a beautiful cat. - There is also the bowl for offerings. - Tripe? - No, enemy eyes. Okay, Thursday "eyes", Saturday tripe. We are in the ruins of Atlantis, the ancient continent that united Africa with America. Look! - Who I am? - The owners of the cat. - No, they're gold statues. - But this is golden. - Because? - He has a fake face! Antonio, let's hide. - Marquis. - Who is it? - It's me. Marquis? - Huh? (SUBVIOUS) Shut up, hide. The ghosts. Mom! - Who will be? - The cat's daughter. - Who was? - Mah! - He had the golden mask. - Gold mask. Help! Have you seen it? Who is it? Who is it? - I'm a dead man. - And you say there are people here alive! I died for the world, I live only for her. - For who? - For who? For Antinea, the queen of Atlantis. She's gorgeous. You haven't seen her because she has the mask. - Do you know why he has the mask? - It will be carnival. No, because its beauty is fatal. Whoever looks at her falls in love with her and goes mad. Crazy, like me. - Do you see that I'm crazy? - No! For charity! - Yet they are. You ca n't live without looking at it. - Yeah. - You ca n't look at it without touching it. - Yeah. - You can't touch it without ... - Without "thing". Without dying. LAUGH GONG SHOTS Marquis, let's go away. Better Arabs alive than crazy dead. I have a bad feeling, let's go. Stay close to me, unity is strength! Yes like this! Ah! Here are the strangers, queen! - (ANTINEA) Leave me alone. - Well, I'm going away too. No, you have to stay. - Do you know who I am? - Yes, Antinea, the queen of Atlantis. Did they tell you about me? What did they tell you? - That you are beautiful, but I don't believe it. - Because? - A beautiful woman does not cover her face with a mask. - It's bad. - Do you want to see my face? - Yup. You will regret it. Ah! So much for baking soda! - What do you say? - You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. - Do I look beautiful to you? - Holy shit! - So you like me? - Very much, he's stronger than me, I like you! Too bad, I don't like you. - I like him. - I? - Yes you. - He? - Yes, and you'll be mine. - This I will never allow! Marquis, if you "fit", eh! - Be careful what you do! - I don't do anything, she does it. - I love you, stranger. - Loves me. You are the man who will share the treasures of Atlantis with me . The man who will ascend to my side on the throne of my fathers. - Do you want? - Sure. I will ascend the throne of your fathers, your mothers, of brothers, cousins, brothers-in-law, kindreds, up to the seventh degree! - Ah! - Marquis, why are you angry? - You are in love with Lulu. - Who is Lulu? I only know her. Even unpunished! Respectfully speaking, she "pappo" me. - Leave her, Antonio, or I'll kill you! - Oh yes? - Beauty, are you the queen here? - Yes and you will be the king. A king who commands or a king who does not command? - The absolute master. - The absolute master? Oh yes? Mr. Marquis, with respect speaking, now I'll take care of it. Sorry. Gentlemen! Take the marquis to jail! Sorry. Obey. What do you do? Leave me! I will make you pay! I'll give you the 8 days! Yes sir, in the meantime, now I have 8 nights. - Alone at last! - Alone at last. - You are very beautiful. - And you see me now. You should have seen me at 3. My hair was long like this. Everyone mistook me for a sissy. I've kissed over 1,000 men. The past of a woman does not interest me , I am a man of the world. - But I've never met a man like you. - Sure. - I'm scared. - Why are you afraid? A "piece" of a queen like you, but stop! - I'm afraid of falling in love. - Honey, kiss me. Stand aside, you are unclean. You have to purify yourself. Ancelle. Take it over and style it for the holidays. - We don't play jokes. - Be calm. Perfume it and dress it for the rite of love. For that matter ... Hello. Girls, I'm ready. - Below is empty. - There is a passage. - Get out there. - What will it be, master? - I know it's there! Street! Go back to the camp and say nothing. Street! SHOOTING Here you are ready for the sacrifice. Girls, oibò! What happens? - Poor fellow! - Poor fellow! Poor fellow! Poor man a damn! Right now the best is coming. - I wonder why! - I tell you. - What a fright! How's the madness going? - Go away. - Right now? No. - Go away. Because? - In that room ... - Well? There are two doors and a staircase. The first door leads to the treasure, the stairway to freedom, and the second leads to death. And you will walk out of that door! Besides being crazy, you are also a jinx! The statues over there are not statues. - I touched them. - They're dead. - Golden dead - Even fried? - You will do the same. Golden and fried? - A kiss from Antinea kills! - What ways! What an ugly flaw, I can't see anymore! - What were you saying? - Whoever kisses the queen dies. - Have you eaten onions? - No, Antinea has poisoned lips. Those lips! How I would like to kiss those lips! - But if they're poisoned ... - It doesn't matter, I want to die. - So ... - I can't live without his love. - I want to die. - And now? I want to die. Besides being crazy, he's stupid. Are you ready, my lord? - You look great. Come. - I can not. - Because? - I have a meeting with the board of directors. Come. - Sit down. - Thanks. - I want to see how you kiss. - I don't know how to kiss. - Mom didn't tell me anything. - I'll teach you. I am ashamed. - Whose? There is nobody. - For this. - What are you waiting for to kiss me? - If you really want to... More on. Higher still. But where do you kiss? Here. - You're stupid. - Because? - There are bacilli. With a kiss, billions of hundreds of bacilli are transmitted . - Enough, I want you. - Help! You take advantage of my innocence! I mean, why are you doing this? You do not like me? Do I disgust you? You will pay dearly for this affront. You will die! - Guards! - Why are you calling the guards? Do not get angry. I like you very much, but I'm not used to these things. - Let's get married first. - Okay, we'll get married tonight. We postpone everything to this evening. Stop, don't go away. You must understand me, in my country these things are not done. The country is small, people whisper. If you really wish ... But don't look at me with those eyes! Close your eyes. I'll count to three. On three I'll give you a big kiss! Close them tight! Strong! One... due... two and a half ... three to a quarter ... three. It has turned golden! But not me! Traitor! - Here is a treasure! - What are you doing? - I'm just passing through. - Damn, you found my secret. I've been looking for it for years! You took my treasure from me! - Rest assured! I'm not telling anyone! - Sure, you'll die. There is dust in here. Rather than sharing the treasure with others, I blow everything up. She is crazy! Mr. Pietro MICCO, don't do it MICCA! Don't worry, I'm going away. I'm going away! - Damn, you kissed her, huh? - I'm not stupid, Marquis. - Who kisses her "there is danger of death". - Thing? - "External use." "Whoever touches the wires dies!" - What does it mean? - He has poisoned lips ! - Let's run away! - Careful! Let's hide from there. - After you. That way! VOICES CROSS - Marquis, to us, who makes us do it? - You are right. - Stop! - Yes, tomorrow! Come on, Marquis. Stop! - Come away! - (MARQUIS) Antinea! - Marquis, come. - Antinea! - Antinea! - Marchese! - Antonio! - Marquis! - Mr. Antonio! - He's the traitor! - Unfaithful dog! - Help, shoot!

There are the "escalators". TRUMPET RINGS Here are ours! The Legion! I'll come right away. Hey! - Excuse me, are you a mirage? - What are you saying, you idiot! - Luckily! - Where have you been? - Yes, sir. - Why are you dressed out of order? - Sir. - Where is Gastone? - Underground with the Arabs. - Dead? - No, live. - I'm in Antinea's pool. - Antinea! - The one with the poisoned lips? - Yes, sir. - Which turns people into golden statues. - Yes, sir. - It's the usual sunstroke. - But no! Don't you want to follow me? - We're not crazy. - We must save them. - No! - Aren't you following me? - No. - It takes an idea. - Here she is! Major of my boots! - Thing? - You're here to forget a woman, aren't you? - Yes why? That woman did well to betray her. With that face! - This is too much! - Get me! Marameo! - Get it! No! Legionnaires have to go up the stairs. Good! Better than before! - Gastone! What is happening? - Everything will end well, I tell you. He must be saved, you promised the marquise. What a beautiful battle! Wonderful! First they collide with each other and then we ...! - I want to go to Gastone, lower the ladder. - All right! Ludovico, quick! - Gastone! - Mr. Marquis! - Lulu! - Gastone! - Lulu, my love! No! My darling no! Nobody will take it! - You want to steal my treasure! - The bomb! - Quick, the bomb goes off! - Soon! - The santabarbara breaks out! - Soon! (ANTONIO) Come! How I suffer! &gt; The big explosion!
