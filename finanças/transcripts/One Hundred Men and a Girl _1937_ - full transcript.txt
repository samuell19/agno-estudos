How do you like that? There he is again. I've thrown him out twice. What's the big idea, do I have to get rough? - Please, I have to see Mr. Stokowski. - Not tonight, you don't. Just a minute, I want to get his autograph! Thank you! Please pardon me, won't you please? With such a crowd out front, you'd better leave by the side entrance. Yes, I think I'll go by that door over there. - Is that my coat there? - You have received another cable from Paris. - They want an answer immediately. - I know, but let's talk about that tomorrow, - not after the concert. - Mr. Stokowski. Mr. Stokowski, I've been trying to see you for a long, long time... How did you get in here? - It's all right... - I'm a musician, and I need work very badly, Mr. Stokowski. Oh, I am so sorry, we must do something... Of course, I'll explain that you can't accept this. Yes, please do so, we'll arrange that in the morning. - Mr. Stokowski, please let me try to... - Oh, yes. Will you speak to this gentleman? I must go now. Will you excuse me? What is it, please? My name is Cardwell, John Cardwell. I'm a trombone player, and I haven't had any work in two years - and I came here tonight to see if I could... - Suppose you try writing to the management? I've done all that. Look, here's the answer. - Now, I'm in a hurry. - I've written at least 20 letters. Nobody pays any attention to the letters. Well, it's perfectly clear, we've nothing for you. Well now, don't put me off like this. I wouldn't have come here like a beggar if I hadn't been desperate. - All I want is a job. - Oh, there you are. - How do you like this guy? - Now listen, please... - I want to tell you... - He's been trying to crash the stage door for months. Now look here, I've got a little daughter, and if I don't get a job, listen, we'll be thrown out in the street tomorrow! - That's not my fault. - Well, I know, but all I want is a job! The next time I catch you in here, I'll throw you out on your ear! - Goodnight, now. - Goodnight! Morning paper! Everyone get your morning paper! Paper! Morning paper! Everyone get your morning paper! Paper, mister? Paper! Paper! I beg your pardon, madam, but did you drop this? No, thank you, I have mine. You'd better turn it in... over there. - Thank you. - Okay. Uh, I beg your pardon, sir, but I... Say! Don't you know when to quit? Oh, Mr. Cardwell, just a moment, please. I must ask for your room in the morning. I'm keeping your trunks, of course, until you pay me what you owe. I've waited as long as I possibly could. 'Course, I feel sorry for Patsy. Your very touching sympathy is unnecessary, Mrs. Tyler. Here's your money, comes to 52 dollars, correct? Why, Mr. Cardwell, how wonderful! Then you got the engagement with Stokowski? Yes, I got it. Daddy! Oh, Daddy, I knew it, I knew it! Couldn't go on like that forever, could it? Oh, I'm so happy! - Darling, I... - Is it true? Yes, Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Stokowski have finally come to terms. Daddy, did you play for him? What did he say? Is he nice? Yes, darling. Let's go upstairs. - Oh, but Daddy, can't we stay down here and... - Darling, please let me take off my coat! Isn't it great? I'm so happy for the little girl's sake. Oh, Daddy, I knew when you left here that you'd get it. Won't it be marvelous? We'll have money again, be able to pay everybody. And you can get a new suit so you won't have to go 'round with shiny elbows anymore. And this hat is terrible, but we'll get you a new one. Oh, aren't you happy, Daddy? Now, Patsy darling, listen. That old battle axe! I'll make her bring the trunks back. Right away! And Michael! He should know about it. Michael, Daddy got a job! We have money! We paid the rent! - Huh? - Daddy got a job with Stokowski! I'll be right back! Congratulations! Now Stokowski's in luck too, tell him I said so. When you see him next, tell him you know the best flautist in the country, me, Borodoff. - It isn't true, Michael. - What do you mean, it isn't true? You know I was with the greatest orchestras in the world. It isn't true that I got a job. Huh? Well, where did you get the money? - Steal it? - Found it. Patsy's so happy about it, how can I tell her? - Don't. - Well, that's impossible. All right, I'll get it, just a minute. Daddy, they want you to come downstairs and have a drink with them. - Mrs. Connell's opening up some beer. - But Patsy, don't you think we'd better wait? Oh, we have to celebrate. Come on, Cardwell, everybody's waiting, come on right down, there's beer! I need no signs, I need no chart, The weather bureau in my heart is saying it's raining sunbeams. The world is young, it's spring again, and I can laugh and sing again, for I know it's raining sunbeams. Now that there's a rainbow-colored sky on display, each gray yesterday seems so far away. Those golden darts from paradise are pouring down to break the ice. Go write or phone, make it known to everyone you love. It's raining sunny sunbeams from above. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm... mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm... Those golden darts from paradise are pouring down to break the ice. Go write or phone, make it known to everyone you love. It's raining sunny sunbeams from above. Now we can pay all our bills. Daddy, please don't move. Next week we'll pay three months'... Daddy. - Do you still need this ear? - Yes, darling. - Then sit still, please. - Yes, dear. How can I cut this mop? Do you want to be laughed at at rehearsal? What would Mr. Stokowski say? - Darling, Mr. Stokowski has... - Yes, I know, but he can wear his hair any way he likes. He can even braid it if he wants to. He's the boss. There you are, sir. Well, that's marvelous! Without disturbing the original line. Looks all right, doesn't it? We'd better hurry, it's almost time for rehearsal. You're not going with me, are you? Of course I am! - I wouldn't let you go alone your first day... - You're staying here and that's that! Daddy! Oh my darling, please forgive me. I'm sorry, I wouldn't hurt you for the world. I'm nervous. If you were there, I don't think I could play. Oh, that's all right. I'll stay home. - You don't mind, do you, dear? - Of course not, I understand. - Goodbye dear, - Goodbye, Daddy. Your trombone! Oh. Thank you, dear. I'll see you tonight for dinner. And good luck! Good morning, Patsy! Where are you going so early? - To the rehearsal. - Well, why didn't you go with your father? I don't want him to know I'm there. It'll make him nervous. Good morning! Hey, where are you going? Just upstairs to rehearsal, - see if everything's all right. - No visitors allowed! That's right. You keep them out. Hey, you can't go up there! I'd like you to know my father is the first trombone player in this orchestra! That doesn't make no difference, Miss Mitzenkopf, you can't go up there. What was that? My name is Cardwell. Huh. There's no Cardwell here. Oh yes there is, but he's a new member and you probably haven't heard of him. There hasn't been a new man in this orchestra for over two years. Now, come on. But... but he was here last night, he even played for Mr. Stokowski! Why, he even signed a contract and... Oh! Is he a skinny guy with a mustache and a shabby overcoat? - Yes, that's right. - Oh, that guy. Yes! I threw him out myself. He ain't got no job here. You tell him if he don't stop annoying people, he's gonna get himself in trouble. Now, you beat it. Hey! You can't go up there! Let me go, let me go! Quiet! There's an orchestra rehearsal up there! I don't care! Your move. Come on, come on, your move. - Sorry, Michael. - Now, look at that. Snap out of it, you've been worried all day. Say, that rehearsal must be over by now. What time... uh, Freddy, what time is it? You'll have to call up my pawnbroker and ask him. Say, Oscar, got a watch? - Yes. - A millionaire! What time is it? - Ten to six. - I must be going. Come on. Maybe Patsy's got enough dinner for the both of us. Now, look, I'll go in first and you come up later and talk about the rehearsal and tell her how good I was, will you? Keep things going. Well, how long do you think you can fool her? I'll keep her happy as long as I can. Not with that face... You'd better pep up and smile. You look more like an undertaker than a trombone player who just got a job. - Hello, Patsy darling! - Hello, Daddy. It certainly feels good to get home after a hard day's work! Does it? You should have heard me play today, I was splendid! After the rehearsal, Stokowski put his arms around my shoulders, patted me on the back and said, "John, my friend... ". Daddy! I was there. Why did you have to do it? You never lied to me before. I got into it. You were so happy. Where did that money come from? I found a purse last night. Found... a purse? In front of the concert hall. I tried to find the owner. I didn't know what to do. And when I came home, Mrs. Tyler demanded her rent. I couldn't have you put out on the street! Is the money all gone, Daddy? No, I think there's some of it left. Let... let me see it. See, I came to tell you I met one of the orchestra. You sure made a hit with Stokie. I mean it! You went over like a million. Patsy, do you know what I heard about Daddy? - Quiet, Michael. - Huh? - Does she know? - Yes. Well, then why did you tell me to tell her that somebody told me to tell you that Stokowski told you you were great? Patsy, where are you going? I'm going to return this. But where? I found the address in the bag. But you haven't had your dinner, you'll be hungry. That doesn't matter, Daddy. What are you going to tell them about the money? I'll tell them the truth. Say, tell me, why isn't your husband here tonight? Oh, he's down at his car factory. He's trying to organize a company starting to grow rubber trees. Oh really, you don't say? - I beg your pardon, madam. - Yes, Stevens. There's a young lady in the hall that says she found a bag of yours. Bag? Bag? What bag? - The one you lost last night, madam. - Oh! Oh, that one. Well, give her a reward and just put it in my bedroom. - Now, that Stokowski concert, I... - I beg your pardon, madam. The young lady wishes to speak to you personally. Personally, about a bag? - Isn't that odd! - Extraordinary. Oh! Oh, hello, little girl. I hear you found my bag... Well, perfectly charming. I simply couldn't have worn the dress I was wearing without it. And then when I heard the bag's returned, I wondered what dress I was wearing! Oh, that one. Oh, I remember now. Oh, it all comes back to me. Do... do you remember what was in it? In the bag? Well, let me see. It's sort of a guessing game, obviously. There was a cigarette case... Yes, there must have been a cigarette case, because you see I'm smoking now. Yes, with diamonds. Well, how odd, that's the one I thought I'd lost. Isn't it strange it's shown up in this bag! Do you... do you know what else was in it? Well, let me see, a compact... and soda mints, right? Right. How's that for a memory? And now, now I must pay you a reward, you know, for returning the bag. Yes, 52 dollars and 10 cents, please. - Fifty-two dollars... - The jeweled cigarette case is worth four times as much. Well, I don't know, that's such an odd figure! Fifty-two dollars and ten cents is what I'd like, please. I know. You figured out what you'd ask coming up in the subway. I'm afraid your sense of value is just as fantastic as mine. You know, my husband's always amused at my sense of value! Oh, Stevens, get me $200, please. Only the amount I asked for, please. Well, what was the amount you asked for? Fifty-two dollars and ten cents. I think I have it right here, madam. Well, would you, uh, would you kindly give it to this lady and now we're square. Square? Yes, you see, we... we used the money that was in your purse for rent, and... And ten cents for car fare. Thank you and goodbye. Goodbye. Isn't that the strangest thing?! Don't go, my dear, don't go, you're too original and charming. Would you stay and have dinner? Come, I want you to meet all my guests. I want everyone to meet this charming little girl. Come along and we'll see what there is for supper. Oh, I couldn't really, I'm not dressed for a party. Oh, but my dear, this is no party, just a few friends who drop in every night. Come along, now, come along. But if I'd known this was going to happen, I'd have worn my Sunday dress! Oh, everybody, I want you to meet Miss, uh... What'd you say your name was, dear? Patricia Cardwell! - Hello, Patricia! - Hello. Hello, hello, hello. Come along dear, come over to the buffet and see what you'd like. - My name is Lintzman. - How do you do? Would you like some hors d'oeuvres? I can recommend the hors d'oeuvres, Patricia. Now, we have some chicken, or maybe you'd like some fresh caviar? - Well... - Caviar for Patricia, yes! - Some champagne, dear? - Oh no, just water, please. Oh, I say, that will hatch them out! Oh, don't you believe him, Patricia. Oh, I don't... I know when someone's trying to be funny. That'll do for you. Oh, well that's all right! People have to amuse one another to keep the party going. - Darling, would you like a little roll? No, thank you. What's that? That's pheasant. Would you like some, dear? No, thank you. Do they call you Patricia at home? My father calls me Patsy. Now, take the plates over to that table. Come along, dear, and have your supper. - What does your father do? - He's a musician. - Oh, a musician! - Yes, see, he plays the trombone. Oh! Trombone! What an original thing to pick up! - Is he good? - Oh, he's great, and he taught me to sing, too. Oh, do you sing, dear? I beg your pardon? - Do you sing? - Well, yes, a little. Oh, well then, you must sing for us now. You'd all like to hear her sing, wouldn't you? - Right now? - Yes, dear! Not a thought, not a care, with a heart debonair I am free as the sea. Like the lark who at dawn bids the darkness be gone do I sing merrily. With a laugh and a dance, mine's a life to entrance, for I know naught but glee. And the word that I bring and the theme that I sing is the song of a heart that's free. Ah then, let music ring. Ah-h-h-ha, while sweet voices sing. Ahh, ahh, ahhh-ahhhh-ahhh-ah, echoes repeating, measures entreating, song of a heart light and free. Laughing all the day, chasing cares away, hear my roundelay, ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh... Not a thought, not a care, with a heart debonair I am free as the sea. Like the lark who at dawn bids the darkness be gone do I sing merrily. With a laugh and a dance, mine's a life to entrance, for I know naught but glee. And the word that I bring and the theme that I sing is the song of my heart, my heart! Well! Your father must be a very fine musician to teach you to sing like that. Oh yes... oh yes, he is, he's wonderful. Pardon me. Well, we should like to hear him. Where does he play? Well, right now, he's out of work. Oh, that's impossible. Try this one, dear, it's foie gras. - Thank you. - The trombone is such a novelty. Oh, but there are thousands of musicians almost as good as my daddy right here in this city. - You don't say. - Yes, and they're all out of work. And I'd like to know why! Will someone tell the poor little girl something? We can't leave her standing here in the dark. - Any answers? - Maybe we need more orchestras. There you are, darling. More orchestras. Say, you know, that's an idea. That's just what the matter is, we haven't enough orchestras. Oh, that is an idea. It's a dandy idea. - I'm going to start an orchestra. - Oh, how nice! Well, wouldn't some of you rich people like to sponsor a fine symphony orchestra? - How much would you need? - Oh, isn't she droll? Don't you think I could do it? Of course you can. If I get an orchestra together, would you sponsor it? You just bring me your orchestra and you'll see. Do you really mean it? Of course, darling! Mrs. Frost's husband has a radio hour. Maybe your orchestra can play on that. Do you think so? You bring me your orchestra and you'll see! Goodbye, everybody. What about your supper? Oh... oh, but this is more important! Is my daddy here? Over there playing cards. Oh, don't go away, I have some important news for you. - What is it? - I'll tell you in a minute. - Daddy! - Quiet, quiet. Daddy, I'm going to start an orchestra. That's fine, dear. Carl, are you in? Did you take back that thing? Yes, but listen, Daddy... Sorry, Michael. You and Michael get together 100 musicians, the best ones you know. Boys, I bid $20,000. Daddy, we're going to have an orchestra! All right, baby, all right. - Gustav, are you in? - Daddy, won't you please let me talk? - Please, Daddy! - Did you have your dinner, dear? No, I came straight here, I couldn't wait for dinner. What? No dinner? - Oh, they gave me a sandwich... - They gave you a sandwich for that bag? Daddy, won't you please listen? - Michael, are you in? - I'm out. Daddy, I can start a symphony orchestra. - Mrs. Frost said that I... - Mrs. who? Mrs. John R. Frost. She said that if I can organize a symphony orchestra, she's sponsor it and put it on her husband's radio hour. Yes. Now, why would a woman fool a child that way? Oh, but Daddy, she meant it. It was a big party, and I told them straight to their faces that it was a shame so many musicians were out of work. And somebody said, "We need more orchestras," that's all. - Just like that. - Just like that. And I said I'd form a symphony orchestra if I only had a sponsor. And Mrs. Frost said she'd be the sponsor. - Cocktail party, huh? - Yeah, but that doesn't matter because I asked them again, "Do you really mean it?" And they said yes. If they said no, it'd have been different, but they said yes, Daddy. They were drinking, huh? Oh, Daddy, I have no time for such foolishness. If I get her on the phone and you hear her say yes, then will you help me get an orchestra? - You'd better forget about it. - Oh, come on, Daddy, please! Michael. Michael, you come and then you'll all believe me. Then you'll understand when you hear her repeat it. Hello. Oh! Oh, it's you. Oh, it's that darling little girl again. Hello, Patricia. Mrs. Frost, I can't make anybody believe that you're going to sponsor my orchestra on your husband's radio hour. Oh, well you just tell them and they'll be surprised. Oh, thank you! Will you kindly repeat it, please? Here, Michael. Oh, that isn't necessary. You get your orchestra and let me know. Yes, ma'am. Who's that? Hey, wait a minute... Patricia, who was that? Hello? Well, I hope that child's not going to prove a nuisance. What did she say? Did she say no? - She said yes. - She said no? - No, she said yes. - Well, then tell them that she said yes. Tell them what it is, Michael, hurry up, Michael! Listen, everyone. Listen, everybody, look, fellas. - Patsy got a sucker, and... - A sponsor! Huh? Yes, a sponsor. It's the truth, I heard it with my own eyes! Oh, Daddy, did you hear? Do you believe me now? It was the lady, what's her name, you know what's her name! The lady, you all know her. Patsy, you tell them! Everybody'll have money again. You'll all have jobs again. I have a suck... a sponsor. - Who is it? - Mrs. John R. Frost. She promised me that if I could only get... Oh, she promised, yes, I know that. Now look, why not take a chance? Yes, Daddy! - What have we got to lose? - Absolutely! - It sounds like a crazy scheme. - Oh, but it isn't! All right, crazy scheme, we might as well be nuts as broke. - Absolutely. - Instead of sitting around here wasting our time playing cards, let's to through with this thing! Good for you, Daddy! Come on, boys, who's with me? - I am! - Me too! - When do we start, John? - Right away! But we have no place to rehearse. We'll get one. Of course we'll get one. Next. - Your name? - Ben Davis, first violin. First violin Davis, look, that chair right in front of the ramp. Thank you. - What's your first name? - Nice place. Nice Place Davis. Hello, boys, how are you this morning? Gustav Brandstetter, French horn. In the brass section, please, Gustav. Thank you. When I left this morning, my wife said, "Gustav, you tell John this is wonderful." And it is really, John, I haven't worked since a year. - Where am I going? - Come, Gustav, I'll show you. Next, please. Hey, sport, how's about my rent? Didn't I tell you that my daughter's on her way to get it? But you told me you were going to give me my money the minute you come into my garage. - Don't get excited. - But I don't have got it yet. She'll be here any minute. Up there to your left. Take that box and use it for a seat. All right, boys, will everybody please pay attention for a moment? I want the first and second violins here, violas here, and the cellos in front here. I want for you to give me my money! Will you please sit down and wait a minute, just one minute, and you'll get your money! In front of the truck, the woodwinds. There are not enough seats, Cardwell! Well, what about the floor? There's lots of room on the floor. On the truck, the basses, percussion's there, and against the wall, the brass, all the brass up there. Now come on, first violins over there, that's right, come on, hurry up. First violins over here. Now, is everybody... Is everybody here, Michael? - Just one missing. - Who? Who is missing? - It's on your list, can't you... - Sure. Michael Borodoff, flute. Oh. That's me. Quiet, everybody! - Hey, Michael! - Quiet! Are we ready? Allegro vivace. Here we go. The minute is over. I want my money. Now, listen, my friend. My daughter has gone to get the money, in a taxi. It takes 15 minutes to get there, 5 minutes to get the money, 15 minutes to get back. That's 35 minutes. She's been gone 30 minutes. She'll be here in five minutes. Now, does that make sense? I don't know nothing from arithmetics, I want my money. Now, listen, it took three days to get these men together, we want to go to work. I guarantee you your money. Now are you satisfied? - I satisfied. - That's fine. But when do I get it? All right, boys, let's go! Stop this foolishness! You can't play while losing my money! - Shut up! - You call me a shut up? You can't call me a shut up! Get out of my garage! This is a free country, and it's just as free for me as it is like for you. You get out of here! You can't hear me, my garage! My garage! Well, everything's settled. - Where's Mrs. Frost? - Mrs. Frost isn't at home. Isn't at home? Well, where is she, where can I find her quickly? Mrs. Frost left yesterday for Europe. Europe? - Now what have you done? - I founded an orchestra. This porcelain is priceless! I've got a hundred men waiting for me in a garage. - What am I going to tell them? - What am I going to tell them? Oh, Mr. Frost will discharge me for this! Mr. Frost, didn't he go to Europe too? - No, he's here. - Here where? Well, that is, he isn't here, he's at the Merchants Club. The Merchants Club! Hey, come back here! You can't disturb Mr. Frost! You... - Where to now? - To the Merchants Club. - To the Merchants Club. - To the Merchants Club. To the Merchants Club, to the Merchants Club. Where all the merchants go. Merchants short and merchants tall and merchants high and low. Merchants big and merchants small, merchants not merchants at all. - What's that? - That's me, singin'. - Singing? - Sure. Don't you like singin'? Well, I didn't like that. Kids nowadays, don't know nothin' 'bout music. Nothin' 'bout music, nothin' 'bout song. Nothin' 'bout nothin', that's what is wrong... Sir, would you please watch where you're going? Mrs. Frost left rather unexpectedly, didn't she? Everything my wife does is rather unexpected. Say, you sure left him in a fine position. - Have a cigarette, Tommy. - Thanks. Look at him now. Say, when are you gonna quit playing these cheap, childish tricks on me? The day after you quit trying 'em on me. Well, at least mine are funny and new! Yeah, but mine work. Oh, is that so? Well, I've got one for you today, and I bet you'll fall for it before dinner. - For how much? - For a hundred dollars. - That's a bet. - Right. Cheap cigarette trick. Miss Cardwell to see you, sir. - To see me? - Yes, sir. I don't know any Miss Cardwell. She's waiting in the lobby, sir. I wonder who this can be. Look, look, look! I had this made especially for him. Now, we'll just leave it right there like that. Uh-uh, don't touch it! This is going to cost him a hundred dollars. - This is the young lady, sir. - Thank you. - Are you Mr. Frost? - Yes. My name is Patricia Cardwell. It's about the symphony orchestra. - They're all... - About what? Didn't Mrs. Frost tell you? Why, no. Well... well, she told me that if I'd organize a symphony orchestra, she'd sponsor it and put it on your radio program. - And I did. - Oh, you did. Yes, I have all the musicians, a hundred men. They're waiting for me now over in a garage on the East Side. And now we need some money. Money? For what? Well, first of all to pay the rent, and we also need it for... Now, now, now, now, wait a minute, my child. You mean to tell me that you have a symphony orchestra? Yes, of course I have. If you'll come with me right now, I'll show you. - Right now? - I wish you would. You see, they must be getting awfully worried about the rent, and I have a taxicab right outside. You have a ta... Well now, that's just grand. And you have a big symphony orchestra. Oh, I'm so glad you're interested, Mr. Frost. I was so worried when I heard about Mrs. Frost going to Europe, - I thought maybe... - Now, my dear, I certainly am interested, I'm always interested in hilarious ideas of this nature. - Let's go, then, come on! - No, no, no, no! You see, I have some important business to attend to first. Oh, but this is important too, Mr. Frost. But I have to collect a hundred dollars. Oh. - All right, I'll wait. - Oh no, no. You run along and I'll follow you in my own car. And you'll give us a contract and everything? You can depend on me for everything you ask for. All right. - Oh, here's the address. - Well now, that's not necessary, - I can find it. - Wait a minute, Mr. Frost, here it is! Just a minute. Here! Turn north on 57th and First Avenue. And remember, we'll be waiting for you. - That's right, you just wait for me. - Thank you! Hello! Amateur. Funny and new, your jokes, huh? That's the easiest hundred dollars I ever made in my life. - What? - Why, you hiring that child and trying to run me all the way across town. You didn't expect me to fall for anything as stupid as that? (bell rings) I got him, I got him! Come on, gimme the hundred. - Was this the bet? - Yeah, that's it. Well, what about that symphony girl? What symphony girl? Come on, quit stalling, give me the hundred. But I thought... Wait a minute. You don't suppose that my wife did promise to sponsor a symphony orchestra of unemployed musicians? Symphony orchestra? What are you talking about? Where's that slip of paper? I've got to get down there and call this whole thing off! What did she do? Oh, my wife does the cutest things. Boy! Get me my hat and coat. Where's that little piece of paper? Here it is, all right. Hurry up with my coat! Hey, what about my hundred dollars? Never mind your hundred dollars! You wait here. Hey, wait a minute, not so fast there, how 'bout my dough-re-mi? There's $6.20 on that clock. Well, you'll get it from the sponsor. - The what? - The sponsor. He's the man that pays all the bills. Well, where do I find him? Well, he'll be along in a minute or two. But I don't know him! Oh, but you could tell him. He's, uh... and... oh, you can't miss him! Sponsor. Now I'm waiting for a sponsor. I can wait. I'm waiting for a sponsor to get my six-and-twenty. And that, my child, is plenty, is ple-e-e-e... - That'll be $6.20. - What? - $6.20. - For what? For cab fare. Oh. Well, I didn't come in a cab, I came in my own car. Yeah, but the little girl said to get it from the sponsor. What makes you think I'm the sponsor? Ain't you? Certainly not! Certainly not. Gentlemen, I want you all to meet Mr. John R. Frost, our benefactor. Oh, this is my daddy, Mr. Frost. I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Frost. It's a marvelous thing you're doing. This is all very embarrassing to me, gentlemen, I... Mr. Frost, you deserve much more. It's all we can do for you now, but later on, of course... Now, see here Mister... what was your name? - Cardwell! - Mr. Cardwell, there seems to be a slight misunderstanding here. Misunder... - It is Mr. Frost, isn't it? - Yes, of course. I'm Mr. Frost, but I'm sorry to say I am not your benefactor. - Why, what do you mean? - To be perfectly frank, I don't even know what is expected of me. - I want my money. - But Mr. Frost, you promised me that you'd sponsor my orchestra, and you said that you'd even put it on your radio hour. - Yes, did you tell her that? - Of course he did! Well now, I could take a child like this seriously, could I? But Mr. Frost, you even promised me a contract! You even said that if I could only get an orchestra together... Can't you keep your child out of this for a moment? - No, he can't! - We'll settle the whole matter like grownups. But it was my idea and it was a grownup idea! Patsy, will you please go over and sit down and let me handle this thing? But, Daddy, he promised me! Patsy, you go over and sit down, let me handle this, dear. - But, Daddy, he even offered me to co... - Patsy! All right. - Now, we can get down to cases. - All right. So, you actually thought that I would be interested in a crazy idea... - Crazy? What do you mean? You... - Patsy! Yes, Daddy. Now, Mr. Frost, this was your wife's idea. She filled this child full of... we believed it. Now, I'd rented this garage here, I got all these men together here... That's a small matter... I'll take care of all your expenses up to date, - but gentlemen... - I want my money. - Who are you? - I... I... I... Mr. Frost, your wife started this... I'd like to talk to her if I could. - You'd like to talk to her? - Yes. Well, so would I... There are a few things I'd like to say. - But, we can't, she's in Europe. - She's in Europe? And get this straight: I am not going to sponsor your orchestra on the air, on tour, or any place else. - Is that clear? - You don't have to shout, Mr. Frost. - I can hear you. - The whole thing is absurd! - Personally, I'm sorry that it happened. - Well, what about us? What about these men? A hundred of them, and you're sorry it happened? - Don't lose your temper, Mr. Cardwell. - I'm not losing my temper. - I just don't understand it. - It's quite simple. Never at any time have I had any intention of engaging or sponsoring your... your band. I'm a business man... I can't afford to invest in a childish dream of this nature. Why, gentlemen, I wouldn't stand a Chinaman's chance - to make any money with you. - But, they're all fine musicians, Mr. Frost. That may be true, but who knows 'em? You have no prestige, you have no name. Mr. Cardwell here has no name... He's not a famous conductor. - I never claimed to be. - A hundred men playing music is not enough. I don't care how good you are. Unless you're known all over the world, you're a total loss to me. - You'll soon get to know us. - That's what they all say, but the people wouldn't even listen to ya. Get something that'll make them listen! A great singer, a famous conductor, I don't know what, but at least for one night, to establish yourselves as an orchestra, and then you've got something! You're just looking for an excuse, Mr. Frost. You know perfectly well that we can't get anybody with a reputation. - Well, that's none of my affair. - Oh, it isn't? Now, just a minute Mr. Frost... Your wife promised my daughter - to sponsor this orchestra, didn't she? - Well, she was probably just trying to humor the child. I suppose you were trying to humor her too when you promised her a contract. - This is all a joke... you see, I have a friend... - A joke? - Ugh! - Get out! Get out! We don't understand those kind of jokes around here, take them somewhere else! Get out! You and your jokes! I guess that's all, boys, let's go home. Come on, Patsy. - Where is she? - She left. - She left? - Maybe she went home. Oh... all right, pack up. Well done. It was good fun while it lasted. We were happy for a few minutes, weren't we? I want my money. - I... - What do you want? - I... - Well, make yourself clear. - I need all of it now... - Oh, I was sure glad to meet you too. You got your money, we got our contract, everybody's happy, it's a wonderful world. Hey! Hello. How are you today? Come here! You can't go up there! Come back here! Hey, you! - Excellent! - Er, where? Let's play "Lohengrin I." Excellent! Oh, Mr. Stokowski, that was beautiful... It was wonderful. Yes, but, how did you come in here? Oh, I came straight through the, um, the... Uh, around, uh... - Here. - Marshal? Mr. Stokowski, I must talk to you about... It's about something very important, really, you must listen to me for just... Just a minute, it's about... Marshal? Please, somebody call Marshal, will you? - Marshal! - Will you call? - Marshal! - Marshal! Just a minute, Mr. Stokowski, I'll get him for you... Marshal! - I'm coming! - Well, hurry up, Mr. Stokowski wants to see you. Marshal, I've told you over and over again, no one can enter during rehearsal. - No one. - But, Mr. Stokowski, she sneaked in. - I... I didn't let her in. - Marshal, don't let it happen again now. - Show her out now, please. - Yes, sir... now, come on. Uh. Mr. Stokowski, you've got to listen to me, please! - Get out of here. - Please! Just a minute... let me go! Please, you've got to listen to me, just... Let me go! - You get out of here! - Will you let me go... you don't have to push me! I know the way, I've been thrown out of here before. - And so has my father! - You get out of here. I'm getting awful sick and tired of throwing you two out. If I catch hold of you, I'll give you the smack of your life. I'm sick and tired of chasing this whole family around the theater. Hello? Hello? Shh. Hello, what's wrong there? Hello? - Hello? - This is Westing. - Who? - I said, "This is Westing," Ira Westing. - Is Mr. Russell there? - No, there's nobody here, but me. - Goodbye. - Wait a minute, wait... hold on there, hold on. - What is it? - I want to find out if it's true that Mr. Stokowski is leaving this week on a European vacation. Vacation? He can't do that... He can't go on a vacation now. - He can't? Why not? - Well, he has much more important things to do. - Is that so? What are they? - Well, he has to conduct an orchestra, an orchestra of unemployed musicians. Unemployed musicians? That sounds very interesting. I should say it is, and Mr. Frost is going to sponsor it. - John R. Frost? - Yes, Mr. John R. Frost. Well, thank you, thank you very much. Don't mention it, you're welcome... goodbye. Have to hold a spot in the next edition for feature story: Stokowski is going to conduct - an orchestra of unemployed musicians. - Really? And oh, Tommy... send a box of candy up to that secretary in his office. Yes, Mr. Westing. What are you doing here? Oh, uh, me? Oh, nothing, just... - Just waiting. - Waiting? - Who are you waiting for? - Mr. Stokowski. - Why? - Be... because he... he's told me to. He wants to see me... he said he was busy, but he'd be through soon, and that if I'd wait, he'd see me, and I'm waiting. Waiting. This is a lovely office... Someone around here has... has excellent taste. - When did Mr. Stokowski tell you this? - Well, he didn't... I can see it by the furniture, - and the rugs. - I mean, when did he tell you to wait? Oh, well, I just saw him just now, just a minute ago. You saw him during a rehearsal? Well, of course, I waited until he was finished. They played "Lohengrin"... oh, it was beautiful. I like the brasses especially. What's a matter? Don't you like "Lohengrin"? That has nothing to do with what you're doing here. Of course it hasn't, this is an entirely different matter. - What matter? - It's personal between Mr. Stokowski and me. - I don't believe it. - You'd better, it's true. I'll find out if it's true or not in just a moment. Well, you better not do that... he's rehearsing and he doesn't like to be disturbed - when he's rehearsing. - I know all about that too, - I happen to be his manager. - Ahh. Oh, gentlemen, now we must rehearse Mozart. "Hallelujah," will you pass these back? Oh, here are some more. - You want to speak to me? - I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a young girl - in your room. - What, is she still here? I told her to go home. - I see. - Now, oboes, you have a very important part here. Hey, bud, you seen anything of a little girl around here? - With a feather in her hat? - Yeah, and a blue coat. - Yeah, I just threw her out of here. - Now, wait a minute. I have been out there all the time, and she didn't come out, and if I don't find her, I'm gonna lose $7.90 cab fare. If I don't find her, I'm gonna lose my job! Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, lelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, lelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah, lelujah. Hallelujah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah-ah. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Ah-hallelujah. Hallelujah, lelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelu-jah. - Here I am again. - So I see. - I'll take care of this young lady. - It's all right. - You have a remarkable voice. - Mr. Stokowski, I must talk to you... - About singing, I suppose? - Oh my goodness, no. - I didn't want to talk to you... - Oh, but you should, because you have - a real talent for singing. - Thank you. - Who taught you that music of Mozart? - My father. - Your father? He must be a good musician. - Oh, yes, he is, and I have a hundred more just like him, a hundred fine musicians. - My orchestra. - Your orchestra? So, you have an orchestra? - Yeah. - But, it's not as good as mine, is it? Well, I personally think it's better. So, did you hear that, gentlemen? I told you in the rehearsal this morning, "We can't relax." Mr. Stokowski, I wanted to ask you if... If you'd be kind enough to... To conduct my orchestra. - Oh, is that all you want? - Just for one night, that's all we'd need you... - But, you see, I have my own orchestra. - Yes, I know. - I know you don't think much of it. - Oh, but uh... But, they're accustomed to me, and I think they're wonderful. But, I understand that Mr. Stokowski, but if you'd just listen to my men just once, - I'm sure that you'd be convinced... - You know, this child is wasting - our rather valuable time. - If you'd only give them just one audition... - Where are they playing now? - Well, right now they're playing in an old garage. If you'd just come... Please, gentlemen. Stop laughing! It's not funny that some men are out of work and have to rehearse in a garage! And it's very rude to laugh at people and their bad luck! You oughta be ashamed of yourselves! All of you! - This has gone too far, you have to go. - Mr. Stokowski, please. Everything depends upon you. We have a sponsor, and he... He says if we could only get you, that... Oh, please say yes, Mr. Stokowski, please. I'd like to, but it's impossible. I'm leaving for Europe after the next concert. But... but, you can go on a vacation any time, and... it's much nicer in the summer anyway. I promised to conduct in Europe, and I must keep those promises, but when I come back, we'll meet and talk it all over. - When will that be? - In about... six months. Six months? And... and you can't stay now? I'm so sorry, but I can't. I'm sorry too. It would've meant so much to us. Where do we go now, Miss? What's a matter? Anything wrong? Oh, excuse me, I didn't understand you. I was just saying, have you got some kind of trouble? Oh oh, you oughta be the happiest kid in the world. Holy smoke, that voice of yours. Why, when you swung up to that high C, I couldn't have climbed out of my shoes trying to get up there with ya. And when ya socked it up to the chandelier, and hung it there till you got ready to let it down... uh-uh. It was a pip. You know, I can see now why you didn't care much about my voice. Compared to yours, I make noises that sound like a set of bad brakes on a hot day. That was a nice song too... what's the name of it? - Hm? - The number you were chirpin' in there. - You know, the song. - Oh, Mozart's "Hallelujah" in F major. Mozart's "Hallelujah" in F major. Ha-ha... what's that mean in English? - Just Hallelujah. - Hallelujah, just plain old hallelujah. Ah, you killed them with it though... You're going to be a great singer some day. - Think so? - "Think so"? You're a cinch! And the dough you're gonna make, woo. Maybe, but that'll be a long time from now. Ah, what you need is patience. Now, all the good things don't come in a minute. - Have you got patience? - Oh, plenty. Could you wait years and years for something to happen that should happen right now? Of course, if I had to, I could wait for... Well, I'm afraid you'll have to, because... Because I can't pay the cab fare right now. Ya can't, eh? No... you can arrest me if you want to. Take me to the police... go ahead. I haven't got a penny! What's the idea giving me the runaround sightseeing? Where do you live? - Why? - I gotta take you home, don't I? - What about your money? - I'll worry about the money. You practice your singing... and don't forget I got $8.40 invested in that voice already. Where do ya live? East 87th Street. - Hello, Patsy. - Hello, Daddy. - Where have you been? - Downtown. - All afternoon? - Yes, I... I tried something, but it... didn't work. What did you try? Aw, Patsy, what's the matter? Oh no, darling. What is it, dear? I went to see Mr. Stokowski, - but he won't conduct us. - Ooh, you shouldn't have done that. But, I had to, Daddy... Mr. Frost said that if... Oh, it's useless, give it up, the whole idea. Daddy, why does everybody laugh at me and make fun of me when I tell them about our orchestra? 'Cause they... they don't understand you, dear. It would've made so many people happy. You made them happy just trying to help. I only wanted to see you have a job again. You and Michael, and the others. That's all I wanted! And to get you out of this... - This... - It's hopeless, dear, hopeless. So you could have a fur collar on your coat, and turkey on your birthday. Instead of beans! Patsy. Patsy, listen to me. You mustn't cry anymore. It makes your daddy feel bad... It makes me feel bad. - It makes you feel bad. - You are a good girl. - Suppose we all go down to the club? - Come on, Patsy, you wanna go? Good, we'll play pinochle, and I'll appoint you my official Kibitzer. How is that? Have... have you got a handkerchief? Sure. It's in the laundry. Here's mine, dear. But, it was such a good idea. Why couldn't it happen, Daddy? Fairy tales never come true, darling. Orchestra! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! So then, he punched you in the nose, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! I'd have given $1,000 for a reserved seat at that fight. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Could you imagine him tangling with a trombone player? This is the best laugh we've had since the Christmas - he fell on the ice playing Santa Clause. - Oh, be quiet, and have a drink. Oo-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh-ho, I can't. I keep wondering what would happen if the bass drummer started to work on you. I don't see anything funny about that. Well, you'll pardon me if I do. Ha-ha-ha-ha. - I don't see anything funny in that! - You'll pardon me if I do. Now I'll smell like a barroom all night. Is there anything strange about that? - This is an outrage! - What are they doing in Washington now? It's these musicians... I never told them anything like this. - Let me see. - They'll wish they never heard of me when I get through with them... I'll sue this newspaper for every cent they've got. Me sponsor that orchestra... They must think I'm crazy. - They can't use my name to put the thing over. - Now, don't get excited. - I'm gonna call my lawyer... - Wait a minute, don't be in a hurry - to call your lawyer. - Will you let me alone and keep out of this? - I'm sore, good and sore. - Why, this orchestra isn't such a bad idea. You think so? Well, you can have my part of it, if you think it's so great. - Can I? Thanks, old man. - Now, wait a minute, I want that deal. - You're too late... John gave it to me. - Oh yeah? Well, why do you suppose I stopped him from calling his lawyer for? - What is Stokowski's number? - Stop it! John gave it to me. - Oh, you're very clever, aren't you? - Clever enough to know a good idea - when I see it. - You mean clever enough to steal it? Steal it? Well, John doesn't want it, but I can use it. - What is Stokowski's number? - Sure, anybody can use $2 million worth of publicity... why, this story will be in every paper in the country by tomorrow. - And that's why you want it. - Why, I just wanted to help the poor musicians. Really? Since when have you become a philanthropist? - What you need is a new radio program. - And what about you? - What's Stokowski's number? - Oh, stop it. Well, you boys must think that thing's pretty good. - Well, any fool would know that! - Well, if properly handled, - a man could make a national reputation with it. - And that's just what you want to do. Why, you'd give your right arm to be called in the White House, and take all the bows as a public, spirited citizen. And I suppose you wouldn't... What's Stokowski's number? - I don't know. - Let me have it, I'll find it! - I'll find it myself. - Let me get information here, she'd know all about it... hello, Information. Let me have Mr. Stokowski's number. Yes, S-K... no, S-K-W... - Oh, you don't even know how to spell it. - Of course I do! - S-K-W... F-F. - Leopold, Leopold. Oh, nevermind! Let me have the Manhattan Concert Hall instead. Please tell Mr. Frost we know nothing at all about it. Mr. Stokowski never said he'd conduct that orchestra. He doesn't even know what kind of musicians they are. He didn't, eh? Well, it was in the newspaper. Oh yes, we are giving a statement to the press for the morning paper denying the whole story. Yes, the maestro is very upset about it, goodbye. - Did you hear it? - Yes. The whole thing's a fake, John... Oh, where is John? John? - Oh, John, poor John! - Oh, where's Mr. Frost, Stevens? He just left, sir. Have you read this? Stokowski's going to conduct us! - It's right here in the papers. - How did this get in the paper? - What... what do you mean? - Why, do you wanna read this? - Look at that. - Right on the headlines. - What's that? - What do you know about this, John? - Have you seen it? - Does that mean us? - I don't know. - Well, it says, "Unemployed orchestra." - Let me see it. - Hey! - Well, who put that in the paper? - Stokowski, I guess. - Does this mean we got a job? - Patsy, you saw Stokowski this afternoon. - Wait a minute! No, wait a minute! - Did he say he'd conduct us? - No, he didn't. - But, you did see him, didn't you? - Yes, but then... - Well, what did he say? Well, he said he couldn't do it, he's too busy, he has to go to Europe... - Well, maybe he changed his mind. - No, I don't think that, he... He wasn't even interested when I saw him this afternoon. - Maybe Mr. Frost did it. - I don't think so, we had quite an argument - and I punched him in the face. - Oh. But, how did this get into the paper? - Oh, I don't know, if Mr. Frost... - Well, there's one sure way to find out, - and that's to call up the editor. - Right, Dad! - Oh, have you got a nickel? - I've got one. - Well, hurry up. - Where is it? Where is it? Here it is. - Thank you. - Come on, I wanna listen to him. - One nickel. - What she's going to do. - Daily Express. - Can I speak to the, um, the... - The editor. - The editor, please. - It's about that Stokowski story. - You want the music editor, - just a moment, please. - Just a moment, I'll try again. - Go ahead. - Is this the music editor? Well, this is Ms. Patricia Cardwell, I'd like to know who put that in the paper. The story about the unemployed musicians. Well, that story came right from Stokowski. No, I didn't see him, but I talked to his office on the phone about four o'clock, why? - Because I can't believe it. - You can believe it all right. If you see it in the Express, it's true. - Thank you. - Well, what is it? - Well, what'd he say? - He said the message came - straight from Mr. Stokowski's office. - Then it is true? - Oh, Patsy, you put it over! - Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me think. You hit Mr. Frost in the face, so... So he couldn't have done it. - But, you found out with my nickel, that's... - Please, Michael, I'm trying to think. - All right, all right. - Mr. Stokowski said, "No." - But, he changed his mind! - Well, maybe he did, now wait a minute. The message came directly from Mr. Stokowski's office. Now, who on earth could've put that in the... Ah. - Well, what's the matter, Patsy? - I... Hey, where's that tough trombone player? You! I wanna see you. But, wait a minute, you don't understand... Don't go away. - I believe I owe you... - You don't owe me anything! - But, the members of my orchestra... - I don't care anything about your orchestra. I don't like you, and I don't like them, and I don't like the music they play. The only reason that I am here is to give you this $1,000 to bind the contract, that clear? - No... I don't understand. - What's the difference? I don't either, but everybody says it's a swell idea... If it is, it's mine. - Here, sign this receipt. - Wait a minute! Daddy, Daddy, please listen to me, you can't take that money. - What? Are you in here again? - Listen. - But... - Can't you keep your child out of this? - I'm talking to my father now, can you please... - Patsy, later, dear. - But, just a minute, let me talk... - Will you please leave us alone? - Patsy, sit down. - But, Daddy, please, just one minute. It's a contract for three months... Will you be quiet? But, even so, Mr. Frost, you don't understand, he... he... All right, then I'll make it six months, now sign that receipt. Six months? No, Daddy, you can't do it. - Please listen to me, just one minute, please... - See here, young lady. This is a holdup, and I'll make it for one year, now will you be quiet? - No, he can't... - Patsy, sit down. - Please listen to me, Daddy, just... - Stop, dear. If you can't keep your child out of this, the whole deal is off. - Patsy, sit down. Patsy! - Just one minute, Daddy, please! All right, but don't say I didn't tell ya. I've never seen such a child in all my life. - That... - Shh, you'll spoil everything. But... but, my... - There you are, Mr. Frost. - All right, and here's your check. - Thank you. - Now, we'll meet tomorrow morning in my office to sign the contracts... now remember, you're all under contract to me... If anybody comes snooping around here, - throw 'em out! - We certainly will. Now, I'll go over and straighten this fellow Stokowski out. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mr. Frost. - Goodbye! - Thank you! No, don't thank me... Thank that little girl over there. She's got more business ability than all of you put together. The little brat. Three cheers for Patsy! Hip-hip. - Hooray! - Hip-hip. - Hooray! - Yeah! - Please wait a minute! - Quiet, everybody. Say something, Patsy, make a speech. All right, Daddy... we haven't got Stokowski. But, darling, you talked to the newspaper yourself! That's what I mean: I put the story in the paper... Mr. Stokowski doesn't know anything about it. I didn't mean to, Daddy... I was in Mr. Stokowski's office all alone, and someone called up on the phone... I thought I was telling it to one man, I... I didn't know I was telling it to a whole newspaper. - I didn't mean to, Daddy, honestly. - The same old bologna. - I knew that. - Why didn't you tell us - before we accepted the money? - Why didn't I... How do you like it? What do you think I've been trying to do all time? Well... what's going to happen now? Well, we've got the money, we've got a sponsor, we've got a contract. - All we ain't got is Stokowski. - Patsy, you've got to see him. I can't, Michael, he won't have anything to do with our orchestra. - We can try again! - He'd only say no, I talked to him, - he's going away. - What if you told him how everything... - It's hopeless, Daddy. - Patsy, you've got to see him. It's our only chance... If you give up, we'll all have to give up. It's not true... this whole situation is ridiculous. There wasn't anything ridiculous about the $1,000 I gave those musicians with the understanding that you were to conduct them. Yes, but you were misinformed... I'm not free to conduct them. What about that story in the newspaper? - Where'd that come from? - Not from me. - Well then, from who? - All I can think is someone deliberately meant to cause trouble and embarrassment. Well, that's not probable. Who'd wanna cause me any... Wait a minute... why, that snake in the grass! - That halfwit! - What's that? Oh, you don't understand, but I do... First, a puttied billiard ball, and now, an orchestra. Why, I'll take this $1,000 out of his hide. Where is my coat and hat? You know what else I am going to do to Mr. Bitters? I'm gonna make him eat that newspaper, every page of it, and I'm going to feed it to him myself. And that's not all... I'm gonna sue him! And if you don't sue him, I'll sue you for not suing him! Where is my hat and coat? That's carrying a joke a little bit too far. I'll make him pay for this if it takes the last nickel I've got, - and I've got a few nickels. - Yes, sir. When you see the paper in the morning, you'll see a different story. - Adams. - Yes, sir? From now on, don't answer the bell, and disconnect the telephone. I've had a very hard day today... I don't want to see anyone or hear from anyone. - No, sir. - I'm going to work late tonight, - so don't disturb me for anything. - Very good, sir. I'll see that no one bothers you again tonight, sir. Come on in... hurry, hurry up. - Come on... shh. - Everything all right? - Everything all right? - Did you see him? - Yes, but I couldn't talk to him. - Where is he? - He's up there, can't you hear him? - Is that him playing? - Yes. - We'll all be arrested for this! Sh, the butler will hear you... He's right in that room. - Is he a big fellow? - Oh, he's about... about so big. - So big? I'll take care of him. - Yeah. Come on in. Give me your belt, give me your belt. Good evening, Mr. Stokowski. How did you manage to come in here? Oh, uh... well, I just... How do you get into places where you should not be? Well, I don't know, my daddy says it's a gift. I am sorry, but you must leave now. Mr. Stokowski, it's about that newspaper story. - I know who gave it to them. - You know? Yes... I did. You did? Do you realize how much trouble you've given me? Oh, I didn't mean to, really... you see, what really happened... Yes, but why did you do it? You must've had a reason. Oh yes, I had a reason... I had a hundred reasons. - Would you like to hear them? - I certainly would. - Really? - Yes. All right. One, two, three, four! - What's that? - Those are my reasons. You wanted to hear them, didn't you? Well, there they are. But, please, just a... - Well, what do you think of my orchestra now? - Oh, I'm not interested in your orchestra. I'm trying to get a good look at the guy that socked you. Which one is it? The trombonist with the curled-up mustache. May we present to you the one who made all this possible, who has brought so much happiness to this orchestra, and to me, and we hope to you. Ms. Patricia Cardwell. Now, you say a few words to them... Just speak to them, that's right. Yes, you. Yes, that's right. Ladies and gentlemen, uh... - I, uh... - Yes, all right, go on. - You see, this orchestra... - That's good. How about singin', Patsy? All right! - May we, Mr. Stokowski? - Which one will you sing? - Um, "Traviata." - "Traviata." Traviata.
