Go ahead, Yamato 3. Kurosucho 4, Kureta Building. Three people confirmed down. There's a lot of blood. Foul play suspected. Roger that, Yamato 3. Two people seriously wounded. - One male confirmed dead. - Watch out. - Roger. - Thanks. - Good work. - Good work. Good work. Roger that. Begin gathering information - related to the suspect. - Good work. - Hello. - Good work. - Bring a light. - Got it. - Picture. - Got it. What the hell? Oh, my god. Hey! - Sasabe! - Coming. - There's a woman! Find her! - On it. Detective Matsui, we've identified the two wounded victims. Harumi Hagio, 23, and Kensuke Kudo, 27. Hagio works for Kudo. - Do their families know? - Not yet. Why not? Hagio has a roommate. - A roommate? - Right. There seems to have been trouble. - A man? - No, a woman. Reiko Nishimura. Age unknown. - She's a prime... - Find her! Yes, sir. 3 MONTHS BEFORE You're awake? Where am I? You don't remember? You were in an accident. An accident? I don't remember. But you were there. What's your name? Harumi Hagio. Age? Twenty-three. I'm a temp. I live in Kuresatocho. Parents' phone number? Well... Okay. We'll give you tests tomorrow. That? The ward is kind of dull. The doctor let me put it there to make the room feel warmer. I made it. Rika Rabbit. Cute, right? Yes. Just like home, right? - You're right. - Good. - Call me if you need me. - Okay. Hey. Catch. This is an important visit. Don't drop it. Okay. Relax! It's not like you hit a gangster. Leave everything to me. Let's go. That one? What? Nothing. Hello. Mr. Kudo. I would just like to say I'm truly sorry about the accident. Oh, not at all. I'm Kensuke Kudo. The police probably told you. This isn't much, but... I'm Hasegawa of Izanami Insurance. I commiserate with the injuries you have suffered. I'll be handling compensation. Right. I'm sure you have people you can call, so we don't have to worry about that. You probably haven't had time to think about paperwork. If I can help... The two principals shouldn't speak directly. Direct any questions to me, please. We should go. Are you all right? That was the insurance company, right? They'll just try to confuse you with legal talk. Thank you. I'll have to be careful. Yes. Oh, I found your daybook. I passed where the accident was on my way home. Great! You saved my life. Now you can call your family. Well, yes. Well... You said something before, didn't you? Before? When I woke up. Oh, then... "Tacky," I said. That's what you thought. What? You show your feelings. I don't think so. No? It was all over your face. You're the first person I've met who could read me like that. It's all right to let things show when you're not feeling at your best. Okay. We seem to get along. I'm Reiko Nishimura. Let's be friends. Yes. You're not on her side, okay? - What? - Leave this to the pros. There's bargaining to be done. So keep away from her. - Right. Thanks. - Sure. These were the plans we came up with. - I see. - Mr. Yamazaki! Oh, Hasegawa. That's Mr. Yamazaki. He runs the Children's Home. He's running for mayor. I'll introduce you. Come on. Mr. Yamazaki. Let me introduce someone. This is Kudo, a friend from high school. He's setting up his own business but is having a bit of trouble. Hello. If you're Hasegawa's friend, we'll have to see how we can help. He can use all the help he can get. As it happens, I need your advice. - Okay. - There are two things. - You told me about this. - Yes. I wonder which is better... I'll have to take time off work. I understand that, but I don't know you well enough to lend you money. Why not ask a friend? Bye. Mom? Harumi? Is something wrong? I got into a bit of an accident. An accident? Are you hurt? And work? What's going to happen with your part-time job? It's a contract, not part-time. That's why I keep telling you to get full-time work! Listen, I need a favor. Money, right? Just move back here. I've got things to do! I'm worried. Who else do you have to turn to besides me? Everything I do is for you. Stop it! I hate it when you talk like that. I'm not coming back. Wait! So you're getting out. Your tests are all fine. Good news, right? What's wrong? It's nothing. I've been comfortable here, I guess. I'll still see you when I come for rehabilitation. What? Didn't I tell you? I'm quitting here. Well, tell me where you are, and we can get together. I've got an idea. What? Let's share a place. - Share a place? - Yes. That will cut your rent in half. Although it would mean living with someone else. That's not a problem. Yes, we could share my place. - Sure! - Great! Thanks. It's kind of old. I like it. It feels like a generation ago. Here. May I come in? Please. It's a mess. Wow, it's so big! You were living here alone? I hate to admit it, but to tell the truth, Mom was helping out. What's wrong with that? And I'll be paying half now. Right. Well, time to get to work. I'm sorry I can't help. Why? Roommates help each other out. Right. Why don't you write down things like garbage days and where the stores are? Anything you can think of. Okay. I'll need your help to get myself oriented here. About the insurance... I can handle that for you. No... Those negotiations are hard. I told you that. I was there through it all, so leave it to me. Thanks. Here. This looks good! I should probably find a job first. You get yourself healed up. That will be your job. Okay. I'm just worried that our lifestyles might be different. Let's just not get obsessed with each other and just do our own thing. Okay. Oh, right. Let's keep a double diary. A double diary? Nurse-patient communication. Requests, complaints... Troubles? What's so funny? We're like teenagers. - What's wrong with that? - Right. REIKO You're the first friend I could ever talk to like this. I was a little worried about having a roommate since it was my first time, but I could stay with you forever. ME TOO. REIKO. I was having a bad dream. Don't worry. I'll stay with you. Mom was in it. She was? I can't get away from her. She follows me in my dreams. I understand. Me, too. Both of us. But I'm the one here now. Right. Don't leave me. I'm always here. 2 MONTHS BEFORE How are things going with the insurance money? It's hard to tell. The guy makes appointments and doesn't show up. I should be handling it myself, shouldn't I? It's okay. I like being helpful. When it comes, I want to move. What? Go somewhere far away and reset my life. We've just moved in together. Come with me. Why do you want to move? Good question. You know, I've never had a pet. You want one? I don't know. - So cute. - But it looks like fun. Pets take a lot of care, and they die on you. Could you accept that responsibility? That responsibility? Why are you so worked up? Let's go out somewhere nice. What? You want to reset, right? Delicious! It's exactly what I need right now. Don't exaggerate! The net said this place was good. This wine is fabulous! It is. They have a good reputation for their food here, too. - Delicious! - Right? I'm glad you like it. - So am I. - Isn't that Rika, the nurse? - I told you this place was good. - Yes. It is. Hey, how are you? Are you out on a date? I don't have a boyfriend. Then we should do a group dating thing. The guy I'm with is a loser. He's boring me to tears. I'm not interested. Don't say that! You'll just end up settling for someone dull. Like lots of girls at work. People need to change, right? Yes. Nice to see you, too. Oh, yes. See you. Nice to see you, too. Harumi. - Yes? - Let's go. There's still dessert. Sorry. I don't think that's true. Now? No. This is over. This is different from last time. Get out and never come back. Shut up! Don't get in our way! Reiko? Sorry. Did I wake you? That's all right. I feel so tired. Reiko. Don't overdo it. You're lucky. If you hate someone, you can move out and leave them. Good night. We're going to make them stronger. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Hello. Mr. Kudo. Ms. Hagio, do you remember the accident? What? Me... I remember the exact instant that it happened. Or... then again, maybe I don't. Most people probably wouldn't remember. You space out, and anyway it's over in a flash. You're right. Why am I dwelling on it? I must be weird. That's not true. You think so? Yes. It's just that you're... What? Nothing. Maybe you are a bit weird, after all. Yes, maybe. You got me. What's wrong? LOST DOG WITH RED COLLAR I hope you find her. Hi. I'm back. What's cooking? Reiko! Reiko. What's that? Someone came in! Who? You were here all along, right? I'm scared! Someone came in and did that and you didn't notice? What? Are you saying I did it? No! I don't mean that. - It's just... - Just what? It's just strange! What I just said? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Anyway, let's call the police. No. Why not? I don't want the police here if you don't trust me. How can we go on living together after that? And you said you would stay with me forever! Hello? Hello? It's Hasegawa from Izanami Insurance. I can't reach your agent Ms. Nishimura. Hello? I'm sorry, but I'm right in the middle of something. Here's the new key. - Thank you. - Excuse me. Here. What do you really think? Sorry? You're thinking I'm a problem. No, I'm not. Those girls should have kept a closer watch... What? ...if they wanted to keep their dog. Mr. Matsui! Kensuke Kudo has woken up. He has? Good. - Let's go see him. - All right. Could you tell us how Harumi Hagio came to work for you? 1 MONTH BEFORE Hello, Rika. You're working hard at rehab. Yes. A lot of us will miss you when you stop coming. That's not true! You know it is. See you. WHEN WILL YOU BE HOME? REIKO. Ms. Hagio? Mr. Kudo. Perfect timing. There's a concert. CHARITY CONCERT AND SYMPOSIUM Would you like to come? All right. Welcome to our charity concert - and symposium. - Hasegawa told me to come. The song is -"That Wonderful Love -It's to support Mr. Yamazaki, - I Want It Again." - who's running for mayor. He insisted. TORU YAMAZAKI DIRECTOR OF SUMIRE CHILDREN'S HOME From that day When we pledged ourselves Such beautiful memories Stay with me Two hearts both saw the same flowers And said how beautiful they were But now Our hearts no longer speak That wonderful love I want it again So you're still in rehabilitation? Yes. But I'm thinking of registering with a new temp agency. Well... Would you like to work at my company? What? Well... It's a one-man operation, but I could use someone to help. I can't offer very much. I import stuff. It's nice of you to ask, but I shouldn't take advantage. But if there's no one else... Please! Mr. Kudo! Excuse me. - Hello. - Hi. I still can't reach Ms. Nishimura. - Sorry, I'll speak to her. - That's all right. We need an agreement from you - before we can pay it out. - Not right now. Mr. Kudo! We were discussing another matter. What? Well... I should be going. Excuse me. Hey. What are you trying to pull? You know why I'm worried! Eri, are you all right? Tell me why you won't sing. Let's go sit down. Come on. Are you listening? - Excuse me. - What? Ms. Hagio. Give that job some thought. I will. I'm back. Hi. You're late. Yes. Sorry. I stopped for dinner. And here I went shopping... Sorry. Try a little. It's good. So... I'm thinking it's time I went back to work. You can still wait a while. I feel like I'm taking advantage of you. Don't worry about that. And it's depressing being stuck in the apartment all the time. And so you met Mr. Kudo? What? I'm hurt that you would hide it. And you probably talked to Rika, too. I'll make some tea. Who was there to help when you were in trouble? Only good old Reiko. Try some. It's good. No, thanks. Good night. - Dr. Tanoue. - Yes? Your tie is crooked. - Thank you. - Good night. Good night. Last night in Yamato, hospital nurse Rika Ando died from a fall following what seems to have been - an attack with acid. - What? Rika? What a way to go. And she thought she was so cute. Reiko? Good morning, Harumi. Is someone here? What? What are you talking about? Witnesses reported seeing a woman in her 20s at the scene. Mari! What did you do? Reiko? Is something wrong? Reiko? Reiko! Harumi wanted to talk to someone about her roommate, Reiko Nishimura. So she came to me. She thought Reiko was her friend, but she had started acting strangely. I'm reading the diary they were keeping. So you know... Reiko Nishimura was not normal. She had Harumi Hagio at her wit's end. But... I believe Harumi wanted to help Reiko. 3 WEEKS BEFORE Ms. Hagio! Well... Is that job still open? I need to work. Yes, it is. Would you like to come in? Thank you. This way. - Sit down. - Okay. Thank you. My father was an architect. He kept his archives here. But when he died, I decided to use it to start a company. You did? But... It's kind of a mess. Well, it's a warehouse, an office, and a residence. Anyway, about the job... This... and this are private. - Don't open them. - Okay. Now these two and this one are merchandise that's just arrived. This one's to be shipped. Well... I can't tell them apart. I get them mixed up, too. It looks hard. It is. That's why I need help right away. I'm back. Ms. Hagio! Good morning. Good morning. - Hot, isn't it? - It is. After that, check the shipping labels. Okay. A little more. Good. - Good. - Good. Looking for someone? What's that look for? Reiko? Nervous? Reiko. Why haven't you come home? As if you didn't know. What do you mean? We've met before, although Reiko got in the way. I'm Mari, Reiko's roommate. How do you do? Stop it, Reiko! Mari. Get it right. Have I done something to offend you? Reiko, why are you being so mean? And why are you so concerned with Reiko? Seriously. I'm right in front of you, yet you ignore me. I guess that's what you're like. Forget about Reiko and get to know me. Stop it! Reiko, don't! She means that much to you? Then keep a close watch on her. Who's there? Go away! Reiko? I AM MARI I'm sorry it's so late. That's okay. I'm up late working a lot. Take this room. It's a bit of a mess, though. It's fine. Thank you. If anything happens, I'll be downstairs. I had the same dream again. He was on top of me. His awful smell made me unable to breathe. It's like I'm not myself anymore. I'm someone else. I don't even remember my own name." Hello? Help me! Reiko? That woman Mari... She won't go away. Help me! Reiko. There's no such person as Mari. So let's talk rationally about this. Okay? Harumi, don't abandon me. I won't. So you just... Where are you going? I'm sorry. I had it all wrong. I won't cause you trouble. What trouble? That's okay. It doesn't concern you. Sorry. But... it concerns me. I've heard of it. As a defense mechanism, children who suffer abuse construct a new personality. Reiko must have been in pain. And I did nothing. It's not your fault. But... Let's both help her. DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER Who is it? I don't know. Kensuke! What the... I'm just... What are you doing here? No. What is she doing here? It's none of your business. What? This wouldn't be about Reiko Nishimura, would it? I thought so. That's why I'm here. I picked a good time. Could you wait upstairs? - Are you crazy? - No. Hey. Something is not right. Reiko Nishimura is handling her claim, and I've never met her. Talk and you die. Why isn't she handling it herself, and why is she here? I offered her a job. I need help. You understand. I understand that. - But why would you do that? - You're useless. Let's both help Reiko. Okay? Anyway, keep your nose out of this! Harumi? KENSUKE KUDO Tell them to stop looking at us. Stop looking at us! It's your fault Reiko is in trouble. Maybe you don't get it. So what can we do to help her? Everyone's trying to drive you and Reiko apart. So we'll get Hasegawa here. Mr. Hasegawa? You do as you're told and I'll do what I do. Harumi? Harumi? Harumi? I AM MARI TO HARUMI DR. HONJO Wait! - Hello? - Hi. I'm on my way to see Reiko Nishimura. Reiko? Your friend Harumi called me. Some shady-sounding place in Kurosucho. - Kurosucho? - Yes. Yes. Near where the accident was. I was right. There's something they don't want you to know. - No! Harumi is... - Shut up. Leave it to me. Bye. Ms. Nishimura? What's all this about? What are you trying to hide? Ms. Nishimura? Mr. Hasegawa? I got you! - Hello? - Kensuke. Harumi? Hasegawa just called. I'm heading over there. No! Stay away! What? Hello? Harumi? Hello? Hello? Help! Mari is going to kill me! Harumi? Hello? Harumi? Why are you doing this? We've always done it like this. The accident just made you forget. I don't know what - you're talking about. - Then remember how Mom's boyfriend used to do whatever he wanted. Harumi? Harumi? Harumi? Harumi? Harumi? And what did she say? Harumi. You can't tell anyone. He's not a bad man. This all happened because you talked too much! Harumi! You're horrible! You're horrible! When things were bad for you, Reiko was always there to listen. That's why I wanted to help. That's how the three of us have gotten by. Ever since that day. That day... Reiko. Thank you. Since then we've been a family. When there was trouble, we promised to always help each other. I never promised that. I don't even know you! What? You're just like Mom. Always saying how she had never wanted a baby. You sound just like her. Stop being so selfish! You're the one who called me! I don't know what you're talking about! Stop it! You shut up. Harumi? Hasegawa? Hasegawa... Harumi? Kensuke! Harumi? Do you remember now? Reiko. Thank you. I'm... Thanks for this, Mom. The accident just made you forget. You're the first person I've met who could read me like that. Pets take a lot of care, and they die on you. Could you accept that responsibility? People need to change, - right? - Yes. Nice to see you, too. I'm Mari. Report from the site. Three people confirmed down. One is deceased. Two are unconscious. -Medics report one dead -Gather information on site. - and two critically injured. - Secure the site. - Confirm identities and secure the area. - We're loading! Gather information on the suspect! WAKABA MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL They just found her mother's body underneath the floorboards of her house. She had been taking her mother's money a bit at a time. From the diary, she seems to have believed her mother was sending it. Reiko Nishimura was a chimera created by Harumi Hagio, when in fact the nurse Rika Ando and your friend Hasegawa were people that she... HARMONIA PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC Reiko Nishimura was a very striking case. REGISTRY You mean Harumi Hagio? Yes. -She came to this clinic -My father passed away. with amnesia three years ago as Reiko Nishimura. This is the Reiko character. Me, my mom, and him. Hey. You noticed? - She changed? - Yes. Now it's Harumi. I knew all along. Now I'm even more confused. So is Reiko the main character? Harumi is her real identity, of course. We believe the secondary characters emerge to preserve that main one. To preserve? Are there any other characters? In this diary, I can see handwriting from four different people. I see. A fourth character. That's possible. Probably one from childhood. A fourth character... EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN WELFARE Hi there! Have a balloon. - Thank you. - Sure. Thanks. I had the same dream again. - He was on top of me. - ...on top of me. - His awful smell... - His awful smell made me unable to breathe. It's like I'm not myself anymore. I'm someone else. I don't even remember my own name. Eri. Eri. I see. Good morning. Mari! Mari! I'M SOMEONE ELSE. Detective! There's a fourth! They're all Harumi Hagio! No! This one really exists. Look, right now we just have to wait until Harumi Hagio wakes up. I'll call you. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN WELFARE A fourth? WAKABA MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL You idiot! Congratulations, sir. - Thank you. - It's a full house. Yes. - They're here to see you. - Yes. Good luck. We're all behind you. Thank you. It has been hard, hasn't it? This is how you escape. You take on another name. Okay. Mari. Sure. I'll give you that name. I AM MARI Excuse me. I'm sorry. Oh, hello! Hello. Thank you for all you're doing. Thank you. We're behind you. Mr. Yamazaki! Mr. Yamazaki! Upstairs! Who's that? What's going on? Eri? Upstairs! Eri! No! I'm Mari! I'm sorry. I put you up to this. - Ambulance! - Secured! - Ambulance! - Wait! Harumi! Harumi! It seems that Harumi Hagio sheltered that girl Eri in her apartment. She egged her on. To justify her own crimes, he tried to get Eri to murder Yamazaki. I think... Mari wanted to grow a character like herself inside Eri. One who would act the same. But I think Harumi and Reiko wanted to save Eri from being like Mari. Sorry to keep you waiting. Goodbye. Just one thing. Do you think Harumi, Reiko, and Mari are different people? It can't be easy getting out here to see me. I'm sorry. But now I understand what I've done. Yamazaki has been charged. Good. But the girl still hates being called Eri even if it is her name. Of course. He would whisper it in her ear when he was doing things to her. I was the same. That's why I gave myself different names. What's happened to Reiko and Mari? The therapy is going well. Really? But still... I'm fine. I realize at last I'm not alone. When I hit you, I saw all of you. So you saw through me? I thought... Good. You really exist. Come back again. Of course. Thank you, Kensuke. Let's go.
