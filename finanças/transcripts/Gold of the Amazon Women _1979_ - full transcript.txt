- Mayor Julius, how are you? - Hi. Oh, Mr. Jensen. Hi, how nice to see you again. It's nice to see you, Candy. What do you want? Someone has been calling here everyday looking for you for the past two months. He won't leave his name, but I know I know the voice. I think it's one of our members. All right. And, what does this mysterious member want? I don't know. I've asked him, and he wouldn't say. Well, it couldn't be all that important then, could it? My good friend, Jorn! Tom, good to see you. How you been? Luis Escobar, Tom Jensen. How you doing? All right, how are you? So, where you been Tom? Oh, here and there. Nice to see you, Mr. Jensen. Can I get you something? Yeah, cup of coffee, Jack. Black. Somebody said they saw you selling marine insurance down at the docks. Is that right? Did someone also tell you that I've been working as a longshoreman? I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to finally meet you, Mr. Jensen. You're a legend around here. Why are you... A longshoreman? Because I have to eat. Why aren't you out exploring? Exploring what? There's hardly a spot left on this earth that hasn't already been explored. Really? What kind of work do you do? Oh me, retail camping supplies. Lou's on 48th Street. Are you going on a trip, Jorn? No, no. I'm lecturing with my travel films. What are you then doing here at the club, Luis? Well, you know, Jorn invites me up once in a while. I get a kick out of coming up here and listening to the stories. Yeah, he has a few to tell. I've never been further south than Brooklyn. I'm sorry about that. Excuse me, Mr. Jensen? Yeah? That man just called again. He said he'd meet you outside. Okay, thank you. Keep my coffee warm when it gets here. See you later, Tom. I've been waiting to see you, Mr. Jensen. Yes, sir. I've heard. Do you know who I am? Sure do. You're Frederick Reynolds, and you were killed a couple of months ago in South America. Isn't that right? Yes, but I wasn't. Take a walk with me, Mr. Jensen. I've been recuperating since my return from South America two months ago. Wounds, tropical diseases, they take their toll. My entire group, including my son Leonard, was wiped out by the Jibaro Indians. In the Amazon delta I found something which no doubt ultimately will cause my death. Mr. Jensen, I found the Seven Cities of El Dorado. I see. It's amazing how those Spanish priests could tame the Indians and convince them to build the way stations for the gold. This gold is being guarded by a tribe of Amazon women. At this very moment renegades from the tribe are in New York trying to kill me. Not just that, there's a man. His name is Blasko. He is a drug dealer. He must not get the gold! With it, he can control the world drug market. And, what do you care? My son was an addict. Mr. Jensen, you're the only one who can get to that gold first. This is yours. The map to the Seven Cities. Tom, was he really that famous? Yeah. If Frederick Reynolds had lived in the 16th century they probably would have named a country after him. But, he didn't. Where to, gentlemen? Take us to the Discoverer's Club. Tom, what about those women? Nothing. Not even a vaccination mark. Why do you think those women killed themselves? I don't know. It's part of the Amazon woman's credo. Come again? It seems to me that you've read too many Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan books, Luis. It's documented history, Tom. Documented by whom, you? When Sir Walter Raleigh was in South America he saw them. That was over 400 years ago. I'm just telling you what I read. Also, part of the legend is when their assignment is completed, rather than risk being captured in the man's world, they'll turn on themselves. If you say so. I frankly don't think it's a matter of whether or not our responsibility and obligation is to Reynolds or to ourselves, you know? I think the concept of Amazons... What do you propose we do now, Tom? We? Well, the first thing we're gonna do is consult the wine list. Now, what would be the correct beverage for an explorer's wake? Since this is by way of being a farewell, a great dessert wine would be proper. Can I just have a beer? Where's the sommelier? Ah, there you are. Bring us a bottle of 1931 Port, room temperature. Very good, sir. Always a man of taste, right Jorn? You know, talking about that barkantine makes me want to take a trip again. You know the last time I saw an Amazon? Marching in a gay right's parade down Fifth Avenue. Tom, if you decide to go down there I'd love to go down with you. Why? 'Cause I love an adventure. And, I'm thinking about taking a trip 4,000 miles away from New York City and 400 miles into nowhere. That's one hell of a big difference. Hey, hold it. I'm the host. You know they had wine like this in, of all places, Thule, Greenland. It's the best thing I found in Thule, Greenland. What were you doing in Thule, Greenland anyhow? Well, I'd never been there before. Adventure. - Here we go. - It'd be fun. How is it? Exquisite. It's perfectly... Get a doctor! Someone doesn't want us to go to South America. You mean, I can go with you? Yeah, but I won't be responsible for you, and you're gonna have to pay for your own ticket. All right. Welcome aboard. Thanks. Now if you think this heat is something wait 'til we get out in the jungle. It's incredible. I can't wait. Look at me, I'm sweating already. We just got here. What am I gonna say if anybody asks me what I'm doing here? Oh, you just tell 'em you're a veterinarian, and we're here gathering animals for some zoo. How's that? And, if they don't believe you you tell 'em again. Can I help you? Yes, I'm Tom Jensen, padre. This is Luis Escobar. How do you do? Please, come this way. I received your telegram. It only arrived yesterday, Senor Jensen, so I haven't had much time to find what you need. Right. Now, you were interested in the maps of Terra Incognita, si? Yes, padre, particularly the area of the Grand Parnal. There's been a lot of interest in the Grand Parnal recently. Do you know why? No, I don't. About three weeks ago someone broke in here and took several maps of the area. All the originals are gone. I see. We did have the foresight to make copies, so we still have the information. Why anyone should go through the trouble of stealing sparse maps of unexplored territory is beyond my vision, unless of course they were searching for. Sun's tears. Gold. Gold. Ah, here they are. Have you ever been in our jungle before? It's very treacherous. I know. I assume you're looking for gold as well. Actually father, I'm a veterinarian, and we're on an expedition looking for animals. Luis, don't. Sir, this is a house of worship. Don't soil it, please. Oh, I am a veterinarian. Father. You asked me if I'd been out in your jungle. What about yourself, have you? Five years. That's a long time. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, father. Why do we need maps? You know where gold be, no? I know the area, but not the precise location, and Brazil is a large country. Without the map we might spend years looking for it, and I don't have that much time. Can we go? Ortega, Ortega, it's not that I don't trust you. It's just that you people down here do things a little different, you know what I mean? So, allow me then to check up on you since I'm paying for this. Okay. Landrover, you got a spare tire on it? Two 38's under the front seat? And, you've got machetes, and you have the food right? Wonderful. Now, you guys send the bill to me in New York, okay? All right. Okay, bye. All set? All set. Get dressed. Put on your jungle clothes. We're leaving right now. We're not gonna stay the night? No. Basko knows we're here. How do you know? Because I distinctly remember not having packed that snake. Come on. What kind of snake is that? It's a shushupe. It'll kill you in two minutes, and it's indigenous to an area about 300 miles from here. Does that tell you something? I don't like this. Red bandana. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What kind of stuff can I expect out there in the jungle? What do you mean? In New York, you know, we have the rats and the roaches. What kind of stuff is out there? Deadly snakes, lizards, insects. There's an ant, for instance, an Asango ant. If it bites you within five minutes you're unconscious. In 10 minutes you're dead. Aren't you happy you asked? Well, that's the end of the road. Clear on in and it'll be rough going. I don't see the animals. Is this area inhabited? Just because you don't see the animals doesn't mean that they aren't there. What kind of people live around here? Shuar Indians, mostly. What's a Shuar Indian? Indians who've been in contact with civilization and now live on the periphery of it. About 12, 15 miles ahead there's a little village, and we're gonna stop off there and try and get some supplies. Tom, how much gasoline do we have left? Enough for about 200 miles. Then what? Then we walk. They don't look dangerous. Well, they are. And, don't you forget it. I've never seen real savages before. They cut off heads? Shrink 'em? Nope, the Jibaros do that. Put your gun away. Put your gun away, now! We know guns. Know many things. And, you also speak English pretty well. Bad. You speak...? Bad. We get by. Come. Wife. Which one? All of 'em. How'd he learn English? People like you and me. You think it's safe in there? Let's find out. How many men have come through your village? Many. And, how many have returned? None. How long you stay? Two or three days. We'd like to buy some supplies from you. Thank you. Eat. This is very good. Very good. What is it? It's monkey stew. Very good. For me? That's very nice of you chief, but I'll tell you I'm married. That wouldn't work. Now listen, pal. If I'd known it was your girlfriend I wouldn't have bothered. You're a nice man, brujo. I'm very happy with the hospitality you gave us. Hospi...? Hospitality, you don't understand that? No understand. To... I don't know how to say. Friendship. Friendship, yes. Noboro, he want go with you. I know. Why? Well, welcome aboard. Welcome aboard anyhow. Well, you're still welcome. Don't make anymore babies. What are we gonna do with him? Do we have enough food? If we run out, Noboro knows what can and cannot be eaten. Don't worry about it. He's a serious guy. Yeah, I know. Well, let's help him out. He'll be coming round the mountain when he comes He'll be coming round the mountain when he comes He'll be coming round the mountain He'll be coming round the mountain He'll be coming round the mountain when he comes He'll be wearing red pajamas when he comes When he comes He'll be wearing red pajamas when he comes When he comes He'll be wearing red pajamas He'll be wearing red pajamas He'll be wearing red pajamas when he comes He's shooting at us, he's shooting! I'll try to get into that bamboo. As soon as I reach the bamboo, spread out. Are you all right? Tom? Come on, come on. Here he comes. Come on. Come on, Luis. He has the map, but I can't land here. Then how do we get map? I have a plan, but we must work down in Quito. There's a man there. He has what I need. We've been going for four hours. Doesn't he ever get tired? I don't think so. You know, I'm a native New Yorker, Tom, and I've grown up with muggings and killings and all kinds of violence, but I got to tell you spiders and snakes and people shooting at me from out of the air, you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean? Enough, I want to go home. I want to go home. All right. Let's see. You might find New York in that direction. Now, I'll be sure to call you when I get back. How are you gonna do that? You don't have the rope. How are you gonna do that? With Noboro's help. Now, you take care. Whoa, what was that, what was that? Monkeys. Makes you hungry right? There's crawling things in there. Yeah, of course. Termites. Come on, let's go. Come on, Luis. Tom? I can't move my legs, Tom. Tom, I can't get up! Can you feel 'em? No, no. Can you feel that? No. Can you feel that? Luis, you've been bitten by those Asango ants I warned you about. Noboro! Where's he going? He's gonna go and get you an antidote. Just relax. Noboro. He says it's gonna be all right. Noboro. It's good, I'm getting feeling it already. Let's get out of here. We can't. Why not? Take a look at Noboro. What's the matter with him? What's the matter? He's dying. What happened? When he went looking for the antidote for your leg some shushupe snake bit him. What are you gonna do? Nothing because there isn't a damn thing we can do. We let him die, and we bury him. That's the only thing we can do for him. You sure we're going the right way? I hope so. Yeah, we are. What does it look like? It looks like more jungle to me. What does it look like to you? Give me my machete. Here. Use this one. Do you think we're ever gonna make it? We're sure gonna try. It's like being a monkey, you know what I mean? Yeah, you even sleep like one. Well, this can't go on. Tom, you sure this is necessary? Well, unless you like sleeping with snakes, lizards, you name it yeah it is, mister. You coming? I'm coming. I guess a good morning would be superfluous, wouldn't it? Do not talk. Do not try to escape, or we kill you. Please do follow. I don't know how much further I can go. My legs are killing me. Well, you tell them yourself. Hello, how much further is it to? Your face pose good in my eye. I don't want to hurt you. Please, be quiet. No talk. How much further? Quiet. Ladies, please. We brought new men. Tom. Take a look at these things. Take him away! Go. I'm going. Get out, get out! Run for your lives! Go, go! Get out! Run for your lives! Go away, go away. Why? You'll die here like I died here, and make sure all your children are females. Right. Why? So, they can live. Yeah, right. Peter Vinchel. How do you do? Your name, sir. I'm Tom Jensen. My associate, Luis Escobar. - Hi. - How do you do, sir? And, you are? Hello, it's Ben Girard. Girard? And, just what was that about? He says that you're an idiot for not having tried to escape here in six years. Is that right? Why haven't you? We're surrounded by jungle for hundreds of miles. There's no way out, Mr. Jensen. Is that right? The old man, what was he talking about when we came in here? Oh, the procedure. The procedure, what's the procedure? The procedure for the fathering of the children. I've been here six years. We stay alive as long as we're useful in the fertilization of the women. What happens when you get to be too old? Farewell, sweet prince. How did you get here? Cargo plane, engine failure, en route from Caracas to Iquitos. You've met my co-pilot. And, the old man. How did he get here? Oh, I don't know. He was here when we arrived. How old do you think he is? 55, 60, why? He's 35 years old. How do you know? I saw his passport. Tom, Tom. The contest is about to begin. What contest? The contest for the two of you. The winner gets first choice. Choice of what? Your services for the night. What happens if we don't feel like it? If you want to live, you better feel like it. You. Both women wants you. They have to fight in water. River very fright-ly. Many alligators beneath. I don't see why I have to go back to the cage. Man not allowed to stay with until morning, but away. You want me to stay 'til tomorrow morning, do you? Man not allowed to stay with. How about tomorrow night? First warrior there, first warrior get you. I try be first. You go cage now. I go cage now? I take you. You no try run away, okay? Ultimate prey man. You different, save Polani. Well, I tell you. She was in danger, and I only did what any other civilized human being would have done. Civilized? Four languages, each very close to each other. Words mean nothing. What does that word mean to you? Civilization? An ordered society. We have order. I'm queen. When I die, fight for new queen. In your world, men uses women. Here, women uses men. What do you want? For starters, how about lunch? Drink. Do you know most of the world's economy is based on gold, and you happen to be the owner of a great deal of it? Gold. Bright yellow, hard, and cold. Tell me, why is everyone willing to die for it? Or, kill for it for that matter. Tell us about your world. Tell her, Luis. Oh, it's a wonderful place. You've seen airplanes, I'm sure. Those big silver birds, you know, that fly way over your head. We also know about what you call automobiles. Other men we captured told us about your lives, but tell me, how long do you people live in your world? About 75 years. Here in the jungle, if animals will leave you, you live to over 100. Every day is the same. We have no..., no disease, civilized disease. Every day is the same as day before. Every year, same as year before. It's better that way. Now, no more talk. Drink. Burn everything. Burn the village. Burn it all! Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, let's go! Come on, get up. Get up, out. Come one, get up, get out, get out! Does the name Blasko ring a bell with you? I know that man. He own slave that escape with four warriors who want to see the big world. You know, he's destroyed your village, and he plans to destroy the lives of many people, but on order to do that he needs the gold from the Seven Cities. If gold means this, I don't want nothing to do with it. He destroyed our homes. Homes gone, lives gone. Men did this. Now, that's true. But, you know, men also saved the lives of some of your warriors. See, times are changing. Men no longer work against women always, you know. Men and women do work together, and I need your help to find Blasko. I know location Seven City. I will take you to one only. It's half a day run. This is home no more. Come. Do you have bad people there who want to kill? Sure, some. What you do with them? Put 'em I prison, keep 'em inside for a while, then let them out. To do bad things again? Sure. No good. Here people good until they bad. Once they bad, they dead. What do you eat where you come from? Same as you do. Then how come you not strong like we? Well, in my country women are known as the weaker sex. Everything wrong side down up there. Yeah, mostly. Por que we not go to city straight away? Por que, my dear Lee-Leeo, there isn't enough space to land there. It's only a few miles from here, and if anyone is in good condition to slog it through the jungle, you certainly are. This be Jivaro country. Take heads, make small. The Jibaros are no match for master Smith and Wesson. You bring medicine? Oh yes, of course. I know how addicted you are. I wouldn't dream of traveling without it. Here. In a few moments, you should be infinitely mellow. Shall we go? This way. You're pretty. Luis, you're pretty. It's as it should be. Men made for to look at. Women for work. My womens like the mens too much. Bad. No, there's nothing wrong with it, your royal highness. It's very natural. When left to their own devices, people often fall in love. Why we never talk before? You're always too busy. Maybe we talk sometime, no? If we get out of this alive, I'll be delighted. Jibaro! We eat here. Better we go on. My dear madam, we are an army, and Napoleon Bonaparte once said that an army travels on its stomach. We eat here. Ladies, to a golden future. Tom. Yeah? Do you love me? Well, I think you're very beautiful and very intelligent. That not my ask. No, I don't love you. When you know me, you love me. Maybe. The first of the Seven Cities should be quite near here. Did neither of you ever visit it? Our queen was the only-est person to know where it is. Well, let's all spread out and start looking. Better we stay near each other. Frightful here. Nonsense. Hey you, come here. I go no more in Jibaro country. What are you talking about? Give more money, or I leave. You fool, I don't have any money. I'll give you as much gold as you can carry when we find it. Money now. If I ever see you again, it'll be just long enough to put a bullet through your brain. Get out! You know, money really is the root of all evil. It's exquisite. Rivals the Florentine works of Pisan or Quiberte. It's incredible. It's incredible, and this... This is only the first room in the first of the Seven Cities? I'm rich enough for a thousand lifetimes. But, you only have one lifetime, and that will end very shortly. You've reached the end of your road, sir. You dare to venture where you should not have tread. The price of that transgression is your lives! Who are you? I was once normal-sized, but I have been shrunk alive by the Jibaros. Go now before you suffer my fate! You, you little... pygmy! You think you can tell me to leave now and all this? No power on earth can stop me now. This is first temple of first city. I have no been here long time. Same as before. It's fantastic. You have desecrated a holy place by your contaminated presence. For that, the penalty is death! Go now, before you suffer the same fate as your predecessors. They have been shrunken alive. What happened? Someone's trying to... play a trick on us. That was nothing but a mirror. We no fight like this for long time. How they be small in room? That was an optical illusion. No understand. It was a trick done with a series of mirrors. Where they be now? Probably outside in a cages somewhere. Shall we? I've been dead for two years. Don't you understand? Dead! You can't kill me. I'll come back and kill you late at night, I'll be there with a knife! Mr. Jensen, how wonderful to meet you. After all this time. My hand. I am Clarence Blasko, I'm sure you've heard of me. Could we make a deal? Mr. Jensen, let's loot this place, and then go on to the other six cities. I'll arrange the fencing of the goods, and we'll split the proceeds 60-40 with you, of course, getting the lion's share. I have excellent contacts in the world underground gold marketing business. Well, 70-30. 70-30. 80-20, and that's my last offer! That little guy, you know in the mirror, that's Leonard Reynolds. Frederick Reynolds son who's supposed to be dead. Yeah, well somehow he managed to survive. He's completely crazy, that's why the Indians help him. So, what'd you do with him? I let him go. You let him go. Luis Escobar, the great sentimentalist. 90-10! Where do we go from here, Tom? Now we go home. Home? Oh, the word feels so good. How do we get there? Go to Quito. It's about 60 miles away, rent a plane, and... And, that's it? That's it. That's it? That's it! Let's move it out, come on. A totally unbelievable story. Had I not seen these women outside I would have thought it the ravings of mad men. Well, I guess we can't blame you, Inspector, but that's the way it is. We have been aware of this man's behavior for a long time. Do you know that this man has been soliciting money for the longest while to organize an international dope ring? Yes, sir, we do. You will swear on this statement. - We will. - Absolutely. This is ridiculous. I've committed no crimes in this country. I'm totally innocent here. I demand to be released immediately. Released? There are four extradition orders. Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. You will be in jail for a long time. That sounds like a winner, Inspector. Thank you very much. Thank you, Inspector, very much. Well, is that the way you want to do it then? Yes. What about you? Are you sure? Same? Yes. There's nothing I can do to convince you? No. Well, the least you can do is let us fly you there in a helicopter. We no fly. Bad business. You go up slow, but you may come down fast. Yeah, that's true. Well, what about Mr. Farnsworth? He's coming with us. Every man's dream comes true. You're good men. Well, maybe someday we'll come back. Amazons will be here long after everyone else is gone. Luis, shall we? She wields a lot of power with those women. Well, maybe that's why she's the queen. Why would they want to go back to the jungle after seeing what civilization is like? Maybe that's precisely why they're going back. I mean, having seen civilization and all that. You think anybody's gonna believe us at the club? Personally, I'm not gonna tell anybody. I'd like for these women to live in peace. How much gold do you think we have on the plane? Oh, in today's market, a million or two. Enough to get by with for a while. You want a partner? I thought I had one. You mean? I mean. Bye!
