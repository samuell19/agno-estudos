Jenny is right. You guys found this place for us. And slipped old Pappas a few bucks to put you on top of the waiting list. I think that was worth a free meal. (phone rings) (phone rings) Hey what is this your private office? Lady, you got some mouth on you. What are you looking at?! Ok who wants to exchange Christmas gifts? It's almost midnight. Oh that's the ticket. That's a great idea. What did you get me Cindy? Cindy: It's a surprise. (laugh) Ben: Now I remember. No! No? Why not? I have something better for us to do. Guess what I have here? Um, Antique pistols. Antique, but not pistols. It's Farkas. Farkas: Yeah, when? Farkas: Ok, Ok! Farkas: Well don't be late it's fucking cold out there. It's used for communicating with the other side. The spirit world. (laughs) The hand they call it a planchette. Yeah, right, the planchette. You mean demons and devils can talk to us with that thing. No they don't speak. What they do is they, move this hand, and it writes messages. Ray turn off the lights. We need to set up an atmosphere. Oh the spirits can't see in the dark. Ok now we all place our finger on the hand right here. Jen, how do you know how to do this? Pappas has told me some. And I don't know, the rest I just know. Ben stop it! The spirits made me do it. Honest. Ben be serious! Oh my God, what's it saying! I... am... H... O... R... N... Y... Horny!! (laughs) Please don't do this it is'nt right. (Christmas music playing) Holy shit. He ate the bones too. Enough Jen this is all nonsense. Come on, let's go out and get a drink. Come on Jenny that's enough for tonight. Wait a minute I saw something. Something what? Cold. On my hand, here watch, I'll do it again. Ray: Jen. Jennifer are you alright? I don't know. Help me, help. Help me. Help me? For Christ's sake Jennifer put that thing away, get your coat. Ray why don't you ever take me seriously? I do Jen when your serious. What's all this mystic message crap? God I wish you wouldn't talk like that in front of Ben. I don't want him telling everyone at the studio that my wife isn't playing with a full deck. Ray I did feel something. It's like a cold hand on top of mine. Why do you always treat me like such a child!? Stop acting like one! You're always, I don't know, whimpering! Why can't you act a little more like Cindy? More positive, assertive. Well I'm not Cindy. I'm me. And I got the message. Some message. Help me. Oh just think about it Jen, it's a little cry for attention. Help... me... You know what. Maybe if you had something to concentrate on you wouldn't need help. Maybe like... raising a family. Hey. Well that's more like a grown up woman. Not some little kid. Is that what you think of me? Ha, Ha, Ha. Not tonight Ray I don't feel like it. Great. Goodnight! (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (click, click) (Breathing heavily) Oh! Ah! Oh! What the hell are you doing out here?! The board game me another message! What am I gonna do?! What does it mean?! Shh, shh, shh. It just means that you woke me up in the middle of the night Shh! You're getting hysterical, come on, calm down. Calm down. Come on back to bed now. I'll get rid of that thing in the morning. (music playing) (bells ringing) Hey Jen what do you think? Cindy. Do you remember what happen Christmas Eve? What do you mean? The message. From the board. Oh that so. So, I got another message after we came home. William, William Graham. 6763344? Moved by itself. What did? The thing, the planchette, it moved all by itself. Oh did it now. And did Ray see it? No. Ray was asleep. But heard this awful scratching sound coming from living room. And I felt as if there was something in the room with me. Trying to reach me. Something cold and clammy... foul smelling... like dead roses. Look let's call it. It's probably a Chinese restaurant or something. You sound just like Ray. Call it! You'll see how silly this whole thing is. I'm just a little nervous. Alright I'll do it. Hello, is Mr. William Graham there? Uh, just a friend. What? When? Oh, sorry, bye. Well? What is it? What happened? That was Mrs. William Graham. She said, her husband, Mr. William Graham committed suicide three weeks ago. This shipment was held up in customs. I need your signature. Dorothy. Is something wrong? I don't know. There was a young woman on the phone, who said she was a friend of Bill's. She didn't know he was dead. Probably somebody's secretary. But why would she call here? That doesn't make sense. You're right it's probably nothing. (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (floor creaking) Huh. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! (wind blowing) Ah! Ah! Ah! (glasses shattering) Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ray: What the hell are you doing in there?! Ray: Jenny! Jenny! Open the door! Ah! No! Jenny open up! (wind blowing, crashing) Ray: Jenny! Jenny! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ray: Jenny! Jenny! Open the door! Ah! Ah! Ah! (scratching sound) (wind blowing, crashing) Hey hold on in there! Ray: Jenny open the door! Jenny open the door! Ray: Jenny open up! Ray: For Christ's sake help me! Hold me! What the hell is all this?! Jenny, what is this?! I didn't do it! The board did it. You know what you're saying? What did you do here? Have you gone crazy?! (weeping) Look at this. Scribbling. What does this mean? I'm not crazy. I was trying to throw it away but I can't! I can't don't you see it won't let me! It broke that! Hmm, All right. Alright looks that's enough. Hmm, Just start cleaning up this mess. I'll get rid of this thing. No! Ray don't touch it! Okay! Oh my God! Oh good evening Mr. Jorgens. Pappas it's you. Are you going to throw it away now? Uh yeah as a matter of fact I was just about to. Oh! I'll take it for you. No problem. Oh, uh, thanks. It's all yours. Ray please come back! TV: Winning lottery number 5, 14, 7,3, 21. (yelling Greek language lost lottery) Tell me. Tell me what the number will be tomorrow, huh. Come on. Tell me. Just, just a little number and you make me happy, huh. You, you, you spirits, you do things people can't. Huh? Come on! Come on you stupid piece of shit! You know what I want! Ah! Who, who needs this, this garbage anyway! You ain't got no power!

Isn't this better than playing around with that stupid board? Yeah. All right. Always right. That's what I keep telling you. That's why you married me. (static sound) TV: Ah! Ah! (beep sound) (click sound) (click sound) TV: Ah!! Ah!! Ah! Ah! Ah! (beep sound) (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (deep breathing) (scratching sound) (water running, splashing) Ah! Ah! Ah! No! No! Help! Ah! Ah! (foot steps sound) (deep breathing) Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! No! Ah! Ah! Ray: Jen, Jen wake up. Jen wake up. It's ok. It's ok. It's all over now. We're home. I'm sorry. What was it? Hey, hey easy. Boy you're jittery this morning. Sorry it was an awful nightmare. It's all that late night TV. Give you bad dreams everytime. Oh, can I have some more coffee? (scratching sound) (scratching sound) (crashing sound) Hey easy honey! We'll be eating off paper plates at this rate. Well gotta go. Boy you look terrible. Why don't you go back to bed. (haunting music) (knocking sound) Gotta a minute? Oh sure. I'm camera ready enough for a Wednesday, I guess. Uh, what you got? Something I think you'll find interesting. William Graham. The file on his suicide. Who? William Graham. Cindy has been keeping me informed about the, mystic message that Jennifer got from that, thing. You mean that spirit garbage again. I don't believe this! We're experiencing mass hysteria. Come on Ray I'm serious about this. That file is the explanation. It got alot of coverage, Sunday papers, television. He is apparent some sort of big shot. William Graham. Age 63. Embezzled money from his own company. Found asphyxiated in his car by his plant manager Thomas Varney. Coroner ruled it a suicide. Survived by his wife Dorothy, there were no children. Keep it. Uh, thanks. When Jenny sees there is a simple explanation, she'll forget about all this psychic stuff. Certainly nothing supernatural about this. (phone rings) Travis here. What? It's my address. How? No, no I'll cover it. I'm on my way. What is it, Ben? Pappas. He's been murdered. Take this. Yeah. (chocking sound) He's heavy huh? (foot steps sound) Get him off of me. (engine starting) (engine running) (street noise) Oh. Can I help you? Yeah I guess so, uhmm. Tarot or astrology? Well I'm not sure. I found this thing, it's a box with a hand. And it writes by itself. A planchette. It's an ancient tool. A little touchy, very powerful. And can be quite dangerous. Dangerous? This device you found, the planchette, it's a tool, used to concentrate the power of a user. It is a tool of the real medium. Tell me are we talking about your powers. Powers, what do you mean? Well some people have extraordinary powers, to contact the dimensions beyond. For these medium... this device is a powerful tool. To reach the spirits or to have the spirits reach them. Are these, spirits, like dead people? They're not like dead people, they are dead people. Or demons. But I'll tell you this. Once they contact a medium, they maintain a strong hold, on their earthly host. Anyone who touches the device, or attempts to break the contact with a medium is in mortal danger. Mr. Pappas. Why would a person's spirit make contact? Well only a troubled spirit would. Or one who has unfinished business here on earth. He want, resolution or revenge, and he only get that through a living person. Isn't there any way to break the contact? Any way to stop the messages? None. The spirit's very possessive of its' living contact. It's all real. Thank you for your help. If you already contacted anything please be careful. Demons can also use you or the planchette to enter this world. Please be cautious. Remember things are not always what they seem. Hello. Mrs. Graham? Mrs. William Graham? Well, go on. I saw two men murder your husband. What? What are you saying? He committed suicide. No Mrs. Graham. There were two men and I saw them put your husband in a car and turn on the engine. If this is a joke it's in very poor taste. It's no joke. Please I've spoken to William. He's... communicated with me. These are his messages. I don't understand. William, gave these to you. Yes I've been communicating with his spirit. Oh... With his spirit. I see. I know it's hard to believe. But somehow the hand is telling me... Just what do you have to do with all this? Me? I thought you should do something. Your husband was murdered and I know who did it. Or atleast I know what they look like. Than why don't you go to the police. I, I don't know, I thought, I thought, if I talked to you, I, I, I don't know. Uhmm, I'm sorry, Jennifer. It's just such a shock. I didn't mean to upset you. Thank you for believing me. Everyone else thinks I'm crazy. Well, there was this dark staircase. And... He... Your husband, was being pushed. No, no he was being dragged down, stairs. Every movement. Each step, I could feel. Just as though I were him. Tell me Jennifer. Where was this staircase? I don't know. But than they dragged him to this kinda like a garage. It had a big rolling door in front. And were boxes and cartons. And there was a car. And than they locked him in the car. And I couldn't breath. It was horrible. I couldn't breath. Tell me more about the car. I remember it was parked against a wall. The front seat was covered with a flat...blanket. Does that help at all? It certainly does. Than you do know where it is! Please take me there. Please. That shouldn't be very difficult Jennifer. You described our factory where it actually happened. That's where it happened. Yes I know. Two men carried him here. Pushed him in the car. Jennifer: And.. Sure.. Death..While.. The other... Dark... Deep lines in his face. Jennifer: The other man called him Tom! Tom! (chocking sound) Dorothy! Faster! You wanna talk? It's fucking cold out here! Aren't you going to count it? No! I have another job for you. Dorothy? Don't get smart. Dorothy had a visitor. A girl who says she spoke with Bill's ghost. Terrific. Shut up and let me finish. Now this girl says she say the murder. Described us both. Knows what she knows but may know something. How could she know us? I don't know! What difference does it make?! Get rid of her! No witnesses this time Farkas! Tell me what this broad look like? Tall, thin shaped, what?! Cut it out. Gotta look like an accident. Who knows what she may have told already? Thanks Varney. Women are my specialty. Farkas. The sooner you do it, the sooner you get paid. You get a discount on this one. It's not just the money you know. (party music) (pop bottle) Here, hat for you. My gosh it's almost midnight. Oh don't worry you still got time to get plastered before the years out. Looks like everyone is bombed already. We are trying our best. Come on. I'll buy you a drink. Sounds like a good idea. Ray: Hi Happy New Year. Ray: Hi Jean, Happy New Year. Hey you cats what you doing? You look... Ray and Ben How you doing? How are my star reporters tonight? Having fun?

The maid at the New Year's Eve party, same man who's in my vision. Don't you understand? I met her husband's murderer. Now, the murderer is trying to kill me. She'll wanna know. There's gotta be someone close to Dorothy Graham involved. Jenny please don't go on like this. I can feel them following me. They know every move that I make. Jenny what can I say to you, you have to get help. I give you the address of a friend of mine, a Dr. Ryker. She may be able to help you. Jenny please for Ray. For yourself, for all the people you care about, you say you go? Sure Cindy. I'll go. Nobody believes me even though the messages still come through. I'm frightened. Dr. Ryker, don't you understand that there trying to kill me. But I have the messages. I am in danger. Nobody will help me. When exactly did you start to feel this way? I told you Dr. Ryker it started on Christmas Eve. The night that I got the first message. Jennifer. I suspect it started a long, long time ago. Perhaps some incident with your father or mother during the Christmas Season. Well, only time will give us the answer. At this point however, this device that you have found must be destroyed. Or. If you prefer exorcized. You must assert independence and get rid of it today! Now! I can't! It won't let me! Don 't you understand I already told you happen when I tried. Just look what happen to the superintendent. Have you been listening to me? I listened. I hear a frightened young lady tell me about her compulsion to associate with the super natural. It can protect itself. I know. You're talking nonsense. I'll tell you what. I'm going to a party in your neighborhood tonight and I'll even come to your house and will destroy this thing together.
