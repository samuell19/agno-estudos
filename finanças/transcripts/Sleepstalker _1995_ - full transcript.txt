(silence) (regal music) (suspenseful music) (wind howling) - Thank you, Lord, for this whole day, I'm kneeling down so I may pray, please send your love to my mom and dad so I may make them proud and glad. The Earth I ask that you do keep, please bless all those tonight who sleep and don't forget to hold me tight so I'll be safe throughout the night. Mom? - It's bedtime, sweetie. - But Mom. - Mom, Mom, come on, into bed. Now what is it? - My teacher asked me what I wanted to be in school and you know what I said? - Nope. - A grown up. (chuckling) - Hey, that's a good one, son. - Good night, sweetie, and right to sleep tonight, okay? No TV, no water, no 13 trips to the bathroom. - But Mom-- - And no but Moms. Now come on, there's nothing to be afraid of in the dark. Right to sleep, okay? - Can I keep the light on? - Griffin, we've been through this a thousand times. - But it's scary in the dark. - They're just shadows, shadows can't hurt you. - Shh. For every evil under the sun, there is a remedy or there is none. If there be one, try and find it. If there be none, then never mind it. My mom used to say that to me whenever I was scared. - Grandma's weird. What does that mean? - It means there's nothing to be frightened of. - And that you'll never be alone. Now we're right down the hall so go to sleep. - Okay. - [Mom] I love you, sweet face. Sleep well. - Don't let the bed bugs bite. What? (murmuring) - [Mom] Oh, don't let the bed bugs bite, that was really-- - Oh, so you're the better parent? - That's because I'm the mommy. - And I'm the daddy. - Yes you are. (barking) Shh! (laughing) (wind howling) (thumping) (ominous music) (gasping) - Mom, Dad? - [Dad] All kids are afraid of the dark, they get over it. - Yeah. - But you? - Hmm? - You should be very scared. (laughing) - Oh, I am. I'm very frightened. - You are? (laughing) (ominous music) (screaming) (thudding) (yelling) (screaming) (thudding) (wind howling) - Sleep. Baby, sleep. Down where the woodbines creep. Be always like the lamb, so mild, kind and sweet and gentle, child. Sleep, baby, sleep. (ominous music) (sand rattling) (gasping) Good night, Griffin. (intense music) (grunting) - Don't move! (police siren wailing) (wind blowing) Patio! - [Officer] Around back, check the back! (intense music) (gunshot) Get down, get down! - It's over! (groaning) - [Officer] Come on! - Who's gonna put the children to sleep now? You? - Get that psychotic sack of shit outta here. - I hear your screams. I'll be back to end your pain too. - Come on, let's go. - Come with me. - [Sandman] I'll end your pain. (helicopter whirring) - It's time to retire, I was aiming at his head. God, did he get to anybody else? - Yeah. - Christ, that's six families he's slaughtered. God damn it. Why couldn't we get here sooner? (somber music) - Is the Sandman gonna get me? - No, Sandman's gonna go away forever. Never hurt you again. (police radio chattering) (suspenseful music) (match flaring) - You promise? - Yeah, kid. I promise. (police radio chattering) (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) - Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, I'll hold. Holding all my life, what's a few more minutes? - Few more minutes are gonna cost me more money, next time use a payphone, Griffin. It's like I'm running slacker central around here. - You were right, Griffin is very cute. How could you keep your hands off him? - [Megan] Oh, we're just friends, we don't wanna make things complicated, right? - Oh. He's got a cute smile too. He's a writer? - Mm-hmm. Freelance, mostly. He's on to something that he says could be his big break. He's been working on this article about street gangs for months now and he wants me to do the photographs. - This is wild, my palmist in Cincinnati told me that I would meet a storyteller. - Good, he needs a little romance in his life. - Oh, man. I move out here and you get me this job and get me a room in your apartment upstairs and now him. I'm gonna owe you big time. - Mm-hmm. - Great, thanks. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! - What? - Oh, give me a big wet one, darling, 'cause this is it. Take in this moment right now because we are gonna look back on this for the rest of our lives. - No, you got the interview? - That's right, ese, I am gonna interview Dog Sanchez for my gang banger piece. I mean, this guy no writer, no, I repeat, no writer has ever gotten to. (laughing) - I'm so proud of you. When? - I don't know, they're gonna call me, you know? And then we'll go down to the hood and we'll do the interview, we'll get some great photographs, huh? - No, no, no, I think we ought to bring him up to our hood, I can shoot him in my apartment, I've got all the lights there, the equipment, everything. - No, no, you don't get it, Megan, I would go to Hell and back for this interview. - We've gotta have a dinner to celebrate. What time do you want Dana and me to come over? - Dana? God, will you stop! - What? - Stop trying to set me up. - It's just dinner. She's only been here a week and she needs to make new friends. And so do you. - Hi. - How you 'doin? - The clown wants another double espresso. - Got it. (chuckling) - Bye. - Bye. (phone ringing) - [Megan] Fresh Grounds Cafe. We close at nine, okay, thank you. - You're late, Kenny. - Sorry nurse, but the boys and I, we had a little trouble getting the loony bus through traffic. - Right. Hold down the fort, I need some cigs. - What time you want us to come over tonight? - Huh? - Dana and me, we're coming to dinner. - She trying to set you up again? - And make it fancy, we're celebrating our bid for immortality. Your roommate landed the interview with Dog. - Well, isn't this your lucky day? Let's hear some more good news for you happy campers. Check out front page, brother. Congrats, Sandman is meeting his maker tonight. It's finally over. (suspenseful music) (murmuring) - Cry, baby, cry. Put your finger in your eye. Tell your mom who's nigh. Cry, baby, cry. (rattling) - [Pierson] Hey, whacko. - Yes Constable? - A minister's here to give you your last rights. It's not gonna help, you're still gonna burn in Hell. - You're being a bad boy. I'm gonna have to put you to bed without your supper. - Hey screw you, you freakin' freak. Let him in. (eerie music) - Be still, my son. (Pierson laughing) - [Pierson] You will be in a few hours. - Please, leave us. We must pray. (suspenseful music) - I knew you'd come, father. - The forces of evil do provide, and the thoughts from within prevail. Your destiny awaits. (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) To the terror of the Earth and the comfort of such is our prepared. (suspenseful music) - Glad they're executing that guy tonight, gives me the creeps. - Wanna know why he's so tweaked? (laughing) - What story you gonna make up now, Pierson? - All right, forget it then. But I know how he got those scars around his mouth. - What, you serious? I can't even look at him without gettin' the heebie jeebies. - I saw his medical report when they brought him in. - Yeah? - From what the prison doc could tell, some sick bastard tried to keep him quiet. - I don't get it. - When he was a kid, someone sewed his lips shut. - No. (laughing) Yeah? (grunting) Jesus. - That's why he's so tweaked. But he won't be for long. That preacher better bless his ass good, he's gonna need it where he's goin'. - Only in death is there resurrection. You have three nights to complete your task and forever is yours. Griffin must die! Offer your blood and the portals of darkness shall be open. (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) Guard! He has cleansed his soul, he has one final request, he wishes to pray. (suspenseful music) Ahses to ashes, earth to earth dust to dust. (flames crackling) (chains rattling) (suspenseful music) - Hey, whoa. What the hell is that? All right, go ahead. (suspenseful music) (murmuring) (wind blowing) (eerie music) (laughing) What the hell? (cackling) (groaning) (cackling) (yelling) Jesus. - I've been going to a channeler and when I found out that in a past life I was Joan of Arc I was jazzed, I mean, me, The Maid of Orl Would you stop doing that, please? It's making me nervous. - I'm in total control. - Violent weapons emit vibes that have a life of their own, you really shouldn't tempt the universe. - [Griffin] Well, you kids having fun? - Loads, Dana and I were just swapping past life experiences. Why don't you join us? - Who wants dessert? - I know you guys don't believe me. - To the next life. - It's okay, you guys can laugh if you want but there are a lot of things that we don't understand. The supernatural world does have power. Awesome power. Some of it good and some of it evil. Like what that guy did, that guy in the paper, that guy that killed all those families years ago? You know, the one they're executing tonight, the Sandman? Now that's not natural, you can't explain evil like that but it exists. It's real, it's out there. (suspenseful music) See, I can tell you guys believe me. - It's not that. I'm sorry, I should've told you. - No, no, no, it's all right. - What? Would somebody please tell me what's going on? - He killed my parents. - Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm sorry, really, I had no idea. - It's all right, really, I mean, you didn't know. I mean, hey, you know, you learn to live with it I guess. It's weird, you know, my mom, she used to tell me the story of the Sandman. You know, he was this nice guy who came at night and tiptoed through the house, told nice stories and then sprinkled sand in children's eyes to help them fall asleep. - [Kenny] That's a twisted fairytale. - Kenny. - No, no, I mean, you know, he was twisted. I mean, he really thought he was the Sandman. Even during the trial, they never did find out who he really was, you know? They had no records, no fingerprints, birth certificate, nothing. (somber music) All I remember is the song he sang. (somber music) I just sat there, frozen. I mean, I tried to scream for help but I didn't help. I didn't do anything. I mean, you know, maybe if I'd run to their room, I could've... I was just so scared. Then when the screaming stopped, I did, I went down to their bedroom. And I reached up and turned the knob and... There he was, sprinkling sand in my mother's eyes. She was... She was-- - Oh my god! - Kenny, you cut yourself. Go get a wet towel. - Yeah, right. - Hurry. - I told you about that knife. - You shut up, it's just Griff's story, I broke my concentration, I never heard him talkin' about it. - I'm sorry, I had no idea. - I should've told you. (beeping) - 'Scuse me. - [Megan] I don't think it needs stitches but I think you should go put a bandage on it. (phone dialing) - Okay, mommy. - [Griffin] Hi, you paged me? Uh-huh. Okay, great, thanks. - That was too weird. - [Griffin] Is he okay? - Yeah, he's fine. - Great. Well, listen, we need to go to your place and pick up your camera gear, that was Dog's people, interview's on. - Now? You mean tonight? Griffin, I don't know if I can do this. - Do what? - Go with you, I mean, go down there, it's dangerous. I mean, we could die down there. - Please, no, please, no, no, not now. Megan, what are you gonna do, huh? You just gonna take pictures of flowers the rest of your life? - What's wrong with that? - Oh, god, Megan! I don't need pictures. You know, you're the one that said you were gonna be a photojournalist. Great, I hope you're happy when all you have to show for yourself at the end of your career is a portfolio full of tulips! You better wake up, Megan. - Okay, okay, I'll do it. Let's go. - All right. (intense music) - [Megan] Place kinda makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, doesn't it? - [Griffin] Welcome to reality, Meg. Kids grow up in this stuff every day. - Griffin, save it for your article. Besides, I'm here, aren't I? Fine. (sighs) (camera clicking) Yep, that was some dinner, huh? (laughing) - Yeah. - Sorry about Dana, she wasn't in to all that new age stuff when we were growing up. I was just trying to help. You know, you really should date more. - Yeah, whatever. - All that supernatural stuff kinda weirded you out, huh? - Was a long time ago. After tonight it's all gonna be over anyway. Just trying to put it behind me, you know? Upward and onward. (helicopter whirring) Sorry I was being so hard on you earlier. - I'm just a little scared is all. - For every evil under the sun, there is a remedy or there is none. (somber music) And if there be one, try and find it. If there be none, never mind it. (laughing) Moms. Guess they'll come and get us when they're ready, huh? Might as well get comfortable. (suspenseful music) (baby crying softly) (darkly whimsical music) (clock ticking) (baby crying softly) (gasping) (ominous music) (clock ticking) (door slamming) (chuckling) (gas hissing) (laughing) (coughing) (gagging) (dripping) (thunder rumbling) (rock music) (wind blowing) (glass shattering) (dogs barking) (suspenseful music) (car alarms blaring) Mr. Sanchez? (echoing footsteps) Mr. Sanchez? (ominous music) (sighs) God, you almost gave me a coronary. - Well, I don't like being left alone out here. - Sorry. (gun cocking) (suspenseful music) - You're the one that's gonna write my story? Come inside, man. (sirens wailing) (sand hissing) (mysterious music) (sand hissing) (ominous music) - What the fuck are you? - Sandman. I'm looking for Griffin. - Go to Hell. - Hushaby. - No! - Baby. On a treetop. When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. When the bough breaks. - No. - The cradle will fall. And down will come (groaning) baby. (screaming) (suspenseful music) Cradle and all. (sand hissing) - [Dog] Death's all around us, holmes. There ain't no hope, kids today can't even have sex without worrying about dying. They're afraid of everything, man. We're all afraid, holmes. You see, that's why we join gangs, because it's family. They're just looking for somebody so they don't have to be alone when they die. - Who'd have thought a guy named Dog could be so profound? It's gonna make a hell of a debut. - Absolutely. - Let's go. And the light this morning was so perfect. I got some really great stuff. It was so gritty. - Oh, gritty now huh? (laughing) All right, all right, so you learn quick. - We make a good team. - Yeah, not bad, huh? (chuckling) - Thanks for trusting me. - Yeah. (laughing) (car honking) There was never any question. (police radio chattering) Hey, what's going on? (crowd murmuring) - No. - [Woman] Oh, it's awful. (crowd murmuring) (crying) - 'Scuse me, are you family? - Yeah, I mean, I'm his roommate. - I'm very sorry. Why don't we go to my car? I need to get some information from you. Come on sir, you really don't need to see that. Please. Make room here. (suspenseful music) (camera clicking) Looks like an accident. Coroner said it was-- - An accident? - Yeah, seems as though he went up on the roof, got something in his eye, lost his bearing. - He was drinking. We should've done something. - Wait, what do you mean he got something in his eyes? - Coroner said it was sand. Yeah, the Santa Anas were blowing pretty strong last night. (ominous music) Again, I'm very, very sorry. - Sand, sand! - Griffin. - Sand, you don't think it's just a little strange? - What? - The sand, Megan, the sand. Kenny had sand in his eyes. - Griffin, would you listen to yourself? - It's the same thing that happened to my parents. - No, that's not what happened to Kenny, okay? That guy was executed last night, look. - Okay and in the same night Kenny dies with sand in his eyes? - Sit down, you're losing it big time. Griffin, please. - Megan, what would you think? - I don't know. It's like the detective said, it was an accident. You know he was drinking, he was so drunk he didn't even know he'd cut himself. - Megan, explain the sand then. - We live in a desert, Griffin, Los Angeles is a desert. Hey, hey. Look at me. Will you trust me on this? I'm gonna make some tea, okay? Just wait. (somber music) I don't think we should stay here. Why don't we crash at my place, okay? You can stay there as long as you want. I know how you must feel, but we're here for each other, okay? I promise you, Griffin, couple of days, we're gonna get through this. Griffin? - You want protection? You need a gat. Hey, life's a bitch, man, especially when somebody's sweating you. You see there's the hunted and there's the hunters. And you came to the right place, pendejo. Here's protection. It's loaded, so try shoot, eh? - What about the cops? - What about 'em? Those fools ain't gonna roll through here, they know what's up. (gunshot) (gunshots) - I'm screwed. - You got that right, holmes. Listen to me, man. You find that fool that's sweatin' you. You track his ass down. Get real close and smoke his ass. (suspenseful music) (knocking) - Griffin, where have you been? - Listen, I know, I don't have time to talk okay? I just have to go see somebody. - Who? - Megan, I want you to have this. - Oh, great. You've lost it. - Megan, take it. - No, you know how I feel about those things. Griffin, I think you're overreacting here. - If I'm overreacting there won't be any need for it, okay? But if I'm not, I want you to have it while I'm gone. - No. - Megan! - Absolutely not. - Look this guy took my parents, this guy took Kenny, I'm not gonna let him take you or anyone else, okay? Just, I'm leaving the gun, it's loaded, be careful, okay? I won't be gone long, all right? I promise. (scoffing) - Damn it! Julia! Bring me the iodine. Damn it. Julia! - [Griffin] Detective Worth? - What is this, how'd you get up here? - Your wife let me in. - Bronson, he said he-- - It's all right Jewel. Please, the iodine. So who the hell are you? - Long time ago you promised me the Sandman would never kill again. - Griffin Davis. Damn, you have grown. How have you been? You holding up all right? - Well you didn't keep your promise. He's back. (suspenseful music) - [Officer] Yeah, okay. - Why did he kill all those people? - We never did find out. He didn't let on during the trial. After he plead guilty, the department decided there wasn't any reason for us to investigate why he killed. He confessed, case closed. I came down here a couple of years before I retired to see if I could get him to talk. Wouldn't say a word. - So there's no clue why he attacked my family? - No, he worked a real small area, the only connection was that every family he slaughtered had a seven-year-old son. - [Prisoner] Hey, sweetcakes, you wanna be my bitch? (laughing) - Your family fit his MO. That's why we were on our way over there that night but, we got there too late. Kid, he ain't comin' back, okay? (door slamming) (laughing) - Hey, Bronson, how does it feel to be on the other side? - Pierson, you moron. Jesus. - How's retirement treatin' ya? - It's fine, it's just fine, okay? - Roses? What the hell, you gettin' sweet on me? - They're for your wife, idiot. I know how much she likes 'em. - So this is the guy, huh? Look, I'm sorry about what you've been through but it's over now. You got nothin' to worry about. We got the guy downstairs chilling. They'll be cremating the body late this afternoon. We got fingerprints dating back to his capture, believe me, we got the right guy. (suspenseful music) - Yeah, that's him. That's a face I'm never gonna forget. (suspenseful music) Come on, kid, look at him, you gotta look. Come on. - Well go on, he's not gonna bite. - Pierson. (suspenseful music) You satisfied? - Yeah. - [Bronson] What's this? - That bastard tried to off himself during my shift. 25 years on death row, no one's ever succeeded in offing themselves. I've got a record to be proud of. - Yeah. How'd he cut himself? - He was wearing this necklace with a glass cross. Minister gave it to him. I got sloppy, should've taken it away from him but what the hell, I'm a good Catholic. You know what the weird thing was? When I went to pick it up it just disappeared. That minister was one creepy-lookin' guy. - Why's that? - He was a black guy, 'cept he had eyes that would make your skin crawl. No color. Just white. - I saw that guy, he was across the street when Kenny died. - You got a name? - Oh sure, you don't think we'd let him in without seeing his ID. - Vengeance, you came to me with that wish, my son. Vengeance for the inequities you had suffered before the day we met. I have handed you powers from the bowels of the Earth, power I myself was too afraid to take. But you had no fear. The forces of the ineffable king of Hell are now yours. But your mortal soul is tied to Griffin. That bond must be severed. One night is wasted, two remain. Strike quickly, strike fast! When the sun sets, Griffin must die. (suspenseful music) - [Bronson] Doesn't look like the preacher lives here anymore. - What's that smell? (sighs) (sirens wailing in the distance) - Christ. I think it's safe to say that this guy is in to some pretty weird shit. - Like black magic? - Yeah, those ribbons down there are Santeria. This pentagram, Satanic. These herbs and stuff are all Wicca. - Oh great, that guy covers all his bases and he's into serial killers. What's this? - [Bronson] Remember what Pierson said about that necklace? - [Griffin] Yeah it was a cross. - Hold it upside down it's a Satanic symbol. Makes them himself, that's what the sand is for, apparently. - Why sand? - Well, you melt sand it turns into glass. Probably heated it in this kiln, pours it in the molds, shazam, cross. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. The Sandman has a past. - This kid's the Sandman. - [Bronson] Looks like he and the preacher were together for some time. - [Griffin] His lips are sewn. - You know, this stuff spooks me. - [Griffin] What do you mean? - I seen too many things as a cop not to give the occult respect. - You believe in this? - I dunno, kid. I dunno. (glass shattering) - Ay! (speaking foreign language) - No, no, no. (speaking foreign language) No, no, no. (speaking foreign language) - No? You won't kill me? - No, I'm sorry, it was a mistake, we got a little jumpy, a mistake. - Mistake. (chuckling nervously) You're looking for the preacher? He left this place a long time ago. He won't come back. But he put a curse in this place. It's haunted. I'm not afraid because I'm crazy. God protects the crazy. - Do you know where he went? - He don't come up during the day. He lives at the old refuse plant on Helena Street in the basement. I don't go there, I'm not that crazy. (laughing) - Let's get outta here. (suspenseful music) - God, I hate this day. - Oh honey. Is there anything I can do? (sighs) - No, I just need some time to make sense of everything. - You sure you're gonna be all right? - Yeah, I think so. Thanks. (sand hissing) (ominous music) (sighs) (intense music) - The man in the moon. Looked out of the moon. Looked out of the moon and said, "It's time for all children on the Earth "to think about getting to bed." (suspenseful music) (sand hissing) - Ow. What? Oh my god, Megan! (screaming) Help me! (crying) No! (screaming) (screaming) (sand hissing) - Sweet dreams. (sand hissing) (ominous music) (yelling) - Take it easy, miss. - Sorry, sorry, look, I used my key to get in. How come you didn't answer? - I was taking a shower, why didn't Dana answer? Dana? - [Griffin] Well, look, this is Detective Bronson Worth, he's gonna get us some police protection, okay? - Why? - Well we think maybe Kenny didn't die on accident. - It's just to be on the safe side. We're gonna check some things out here and I'll have a patrol car over here this evening. - Oh my, Detective. - What's going on? - Did you say there was somebody else in this apartment? - Yes, Dana. - Call 911, officer needs backup! Dana, Dana! Dana! (sand hissing) - Jesus Christ. - Shh. Quiet. She's sleeping. (thudding) (groaning) (intense music) (groaning) Time's up, old man. - Use the gun. Use the gun. (gunshots) - Ouch. - Just move it, just move it. - But Dana! - Look, it's too late, okay? We just gotta get to a phone and call the police. - Bullets didn't stop him, what the hell are the cops gonna do? - I dunno, you got a better idea? (glass shattering) Come on! - [Megan] What the hell is that thing? - He found a way to come back. - Who? - The Sandman. (gun clicking) (yelling) Come on! No! Oh god. (thudding) Great, what now? - Back door to the alley. (thudding) Stop! (gasping) (sand hissing) - Oh no. Oh god, Megan, hurry! (sand hissing) Hurry! Hurry, come on! - This isn't happening. - What? - The combination, I keep it under the counter. - What? - Wait, I think I know it. - Okay, just think, think. - 12, 22. It's not working! - Try it again, try it again. - 12, 25? 25? - 22, you said 22! - [Megan] I know! - Come on, open the door! - [Megan] Got it! - [Griffin] No! (glass shattering) - Move it! What are we gonna do now? - Just get to the police. (suspenseful music) (clattering) (gasping) (thudding) - Hush, my baby. My doll. (gasping) I pray you don't cry. - Megan! Hey, let her go! Come and get me, right? Hey, it's me you want, huh? Yeah, come on, I dare ya. (groaning) (crying) - Griffin. (yelling) (car engine sputtering) - Hey! What the hell are you doing? - Oh god. (tires squealing) (tires squealing) Come on, Megan. (clattering) (sand hissing) (tires squealing) - Put your hands up where I can see 'em! I said put your hands up now! - Look, he's in the car, please, we've gotta get outta here! - [Officer] Driving like a maniac! - Please, I'm telling you, he is in the car, you've gotta believe me! - Check it out. - Please, let's just get outta here. - Anything? - Nothing. - Put your hands behind your head and don't move! (police radio chattering) - [Griffin] Suffocating in here. - They're fumigating. Place is infested. (coughing) - Can you maybe open a window? - Hey, if I gotta breathe it, you gotta breathe it. Now why don't you just tell me some more about your Sandman. - Look, I already told you. He didn't die in the gas chamber, okay? He's out there. - And he's made of sand? - Yes! Yes, bullets, they don't do anything to this guy. You know? Water though, seems to like, no, no, slow him down or it stops him or something. - Of course, 'cause he's made of sand. - Yes, yes, that's right! - That's good. You really know how to tell a story, kid. Sandman. Very creative. - I know it sounds crazy, okay? I know, but I am telling you the truth, okay? This guy is out there! (phone ringing) - Relax. Oh yeah. And they say breathing this stuff can't hurt ya. - Look, he has killed three people already, okay? I am not making this up, it is the Sandman. - Right. - Screw you! - No, you've got the handcuffs on, so screw you. - I'll take care of it, Garcia. (phone ringing) Got it smells in here. - Give it a couple minutes, you'll get used to it. - Wanna bet? Well, we've checked out your story. Bodies were there, just like you said. - What about Megan, where's Megan? - Why don't you tell us? - What do you mean? - What I mean is that you better start telling us the truth about what happened. And don't give me that shit about a Sandman. - I am telling you the truth! (laughing) - Every three or four years I get a strange, weird case of some kind of machine turning into a monster or cannibals eating each other, now a sandman. You know, it gets better every time. - Yeah well I don't expect you to believe me. - Look, I understand about your parents, but you know what? Too bad. That crap don't buy you pity in my book. You wanna point your finger at somebody else for your troubles? Your mama didn't breastfeed you when you were a baby? You ate too much fast food? It's all society's fault, right? Bullshit. I grew up in the streets, my father left the family at seven. But I don't go around killin' people. Three people are dead. Do you know what they all have in common? You. So why don't you just tell me the truth? Huh? For once I wish one of you guys would just tell me the god damn truth! - I told you I didn't do it! - Sit down! Jacket him. - I love this part. - No, please, you have to get me outta here. You have to, you have to, he's gonna get to Megan. Please, help me, please! - [Radio Dispatcher] Code two. (suspenseful music) - [Officer One] Megan? - [Officer Two] Yeah, that's her. - [Officer One] You know that body upstairs? It was that new waitress from the cafe. Just moved to town. Man. - [Officer Two] Christ, welcome to LA. - [Officer One] Yeah, and you know who the killer says did it? - No. - The Sandman. - The Sandman? - [Officer One] Yeah, the Sandman. - [Officer Two] Nutcase. - It was the Sandman. - [Griffin] Help me, please. (door slamming) - Sorry buddy. No bedtime stories tonight. (match flaring) (crying) - Please, no, where are you going? - It's 6 AM, I'm gonna go eat my Kung Pao chicken for breakfast then I'm gonna get a cup of coffee and a doughnut. What's the matter with you, don't you watch TV? That's what cops do. - Please, you can't leave me in here alone. - Help me! - Shut the fuck up! That little bundle of joy says Satan made him do it. Maybe he knows your Sandman? - Please don't do this to me, if he comes I won't be able to fight back, please don't. - Hey, if you're a good little boy maybe the Sandman will come and sing you to sleep. (crying) - No, please, please don't go! Please, please don't leave me. - Help me! - Hey! I'm gonna get the hose! - [Man] You're killin' me, man. (horns honking) (suspenseful music) (rattling) - He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here! Oh god, somebody help! It's him, it's the Sandman! Get me outta here! Officer, Detective! - Sleep, baby. - Please, someone, help me, get me outta here! - Sleep. Down where the woodbines creep. Be always like the lamb, so mild, and kind and sweet. - What do you want with me? What do you want with me? - And gentle, child. Sleep, baby, sleep! - No! (yelling) (sizzling) Sunlight saved you, sleep tight. I'll be back again tomorrow night. (crackling) (sand hissing) (baby crying) (clock ticking) (baby crying) (screaming) (yelling) (thudding) (crying) (baby crying) - Rise and shine, sand boy! You're going to county. So the trucker says to his wife. - Yeah. - "An angel came and told me "death is coming for me tonight." - Mm-hmm. - So the wife says, "Well you gotta hide, "somewhere he won't find you." - Mm-hmm. - So the trucker shaves his head, goes to an English pub where he has never been before, he waits all day long, five minutes 'til midnight in walks death. - Mm-hmm. - Looks around the place, says, "If that trucker "doesn't show up in five minutes, "I'm taking that bald bastard at the end of the bar." (laughing) - Couldn't get away from him. (tires squealing) - Uncuff him! - Okay, miss. - Do it! - Relax, be careful with that. - [Griffin] Your keys and your guns too, sand boy. - Now take off your pants and your shoes. - What? (tires squealing) This isn't gonna look good. - Shut up! (tires squealing) Come on, come on! (suspenseful music) - We're running out of time, the sun's going down. - Well why are we here then? Why don't we just go, get outta this place, just get away? - Go where? I mean, he's just gonna find me. I've been running from this guy ever since I was a little kid. I mean, even when they put him away, I was always afraid, you know? I couldn't even go to sleep without having the light on. So see, maybe if I face him, maybe if I face him then I still got a chance. (sirens wailing) Look, I don't want you coming with me, all right? - Why? Because you care about me? - Yes. Because I care. Just forget it, okay, I don't need you coming. - Oh, you don't need me? If it wasn't for me you'd be in a cell right now. Listen, I don't care what you want. I'm goin' with you. And whatever this thing is, we're facing it together. You're not alone in this. You're not alone. (somber music) - So what's up, pendejo? You sure you wanna do this, man? - If I don't do something he's just gonna kill me before the night's over. - Hey man, I don't understand you. Someone's trying to kill you and you come over here? Don't you know where you're at, home boy? Everybody here's already dead, man. (sirens wailing) (suspenseful music) Nice knowing you, pendejo. (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (screaming) (laughing) - Looking for the guy they call The Preacher. Where's The Preacher? (groaning) - Griffin. (suspenseful music) He's gotta be here. I'm looking for The Preacher! I know you're here! I know he's here too! (match flaring) - [Preacher] Evil never dies, it only waits to be reborn. - Where is he? - In time. - Where is he? - That has no power here. You don't know real power. Do you know why you've come? To end it, to start it. Because you are the one. - What the hell are you talking about? Why is he after me, what do you mean? - For every beginning there is an end. He cannot go on until you die. You are his mortal link to this world, Griffin. - Griffin, let's go. - Where is he? - Think. He's always been with you. Remember! - No. No. - He is evil incarnate. No soul, no spark of good left in him. Was beaten out. Let me tell you a story. - Come on, Griffin, let's go. - There was once a little boy who was very, very scared. - [Preacher] Every night he would lie in his bed, huddled in a corner, trembling. His father was a big man, strong, mean. (screaming) (yelling) - [Preacher] Since the mother had died, he brought up his little boy. - And every night he'd come into his room drunk, sing him a lullaby and beat him, beat him, beat him! - [Preacher] But the boy could not cry. Until one night, when he could take it no further, this boy who possessed something special gave in to his power, tasted it for the first time. Evil. (baby crying) (baby crying) (glass shattering) (yelling) (yelling) (baby crying) (record hissing) - He is your brother. After he killed your father he came to me. I took care of him, I showed him the way to his dreams. Offer your soul to the almighty evil. But first, sever your mortal link. We knew you had been adopted, we didn't know to whom. - That's why he killed all those other families. You were searching for the family that adopted me. - As Cain killed Abel, as Set murdered his brother Osiris. So must he kill you. And now the last night has come. The sun has set. You come to me for answers, only to find out your time has run out! (sand hissing) (laughing) (sand hissing) - Griffin! (laughing) (suspenseful music) (intense music) In here! - [Griffin] Oh great, there's no way out! Okay, look, grab some rags. - [Megan] What? - We gotta plug up the cracks. - [Megan] Think it'll work? - Don't think we have a choice. - Now what? - I guess we just wait until morning. If we can survive the night. (crackling) - He's not gonna wait 'til morning. (sand hissing) (crackling) - It's bed time. (gunshot) - Get back! Come on, man, you gotta tell my story. - [Griffin] No, forget it man, let's go, come on Dog! - [Megan] Come on! - [Griffin] Let's get outta here man, that won't work. - [Megan] Come on! - Yeah it will, just get real close. (crackling) (yelling) (thudding) - Okay, we've gotta find another way out, come on. (suspenseful music) - You think he's given up? - Not a chance. God! I need something to pry this open. (suspenseful music) - [Megan] He's here, move it! - Go, go, go! (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) - You've gotta be kidding me. (suspenseful music) - What are you doing? - Worth said when you heat sand, when you melt it, it turns to glass. Gotta find some matches. Come on, it's our only hope. (suspenseful music) Have to do. (clattering) (suspenseful music) (sand hissing) - Wait. There's a door, I can see a door to the outside. (sand hissing) - Quiet. (sand hissing) (ominous music) You okay? (sand hissing) - [Megan] Let's go. - I'll catch up, okay, just go. (sand hissing) I told you to get outta here. (exploding) We stopped him. It's over, it's finally over. - I'm gonna find a way outta here. (sand hissing) (breathing heavily) - Why are you doing this? - The children can't sleep. I've gotta put the children to sleep. - But you saved me. You kept our father from hurting me, why do you wanna kill me now? - To end your pain. - I'm not in any pain. - I hear your screams. I hear all the children's screams. In the night. In my head. The screams must stop. They must go to sleep. (glass shattering) - I think I found a way out. - No! - No! (squelching) (groaning) (somber music) - Good night, little brother. Time for sleep. Sleep for me. (thudding) (crying) (ominous music) (chains rattling) (gasping) (suspenseful music) (rattling) (crackling) (match flaring) - Rest in peace. (exploding) (fire crackling) (dog barking) (somber music) (crying) (exploding) It'll be all right, the Sandman is gone. He's never coming back. You sleep now. (wind blowing) (speaking foreign language) (somber music)
