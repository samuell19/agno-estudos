[music playing] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [laughing] - Look, I got it. Oh, I got another one. - Oh. - Oh, I got. - I got a promotion. - I gotta find something to wear tonight. [chattering] - OK. How do we work this thing? [giggling] Well, I guess we have to get ourselves a new toy. [giggling] - All right. Why did you not like that last gold chain? - I don't know. It was, like, too flashy. - OK. You're trying to tell me I'm dull, right? [giggling] - I think you're flashy, but you're-- you're tasteful flashy. [giggling] - I can always count on my trusty roommate to keep me in line, huh? - Oh. That's beautiful. Go try it on. - Think so? Is there a place where i can try this on? [giggling] Can I try this on? OK. Here. Can you hold this for a second. - Yeah. - Well, what do you think? - Uh, the coin doesn't really go with it. Try tucking it in. - Now what? [laughing] - You thought I was flashy? [laughing] - Come on. Be serious. Do you think Ted's going to like it? - He won't be able to control himself. - I certainly hope not. OK. I'm going to look around but I'll-- I'll be back in a little while. - OK. - OK. Thanks. I'll be back later. What else do you want to see? - Let's go back to that jewelry shop. - OK. - Yeah, these are 14 karat gold chain. Good design. Gold. - I don't know. Do you like it? - It's too expensive. [speaking chinese] - He's not looking right now. Why don't we just take it? - Are you crazy? - I'm serious. - Bobbylee, don't. - Oh, come on. They're not paying attention. [speaking chinese] [laughing] - Come on. - Even when we were kids, you were always the one that got us in trouble. - No, I think that was you! [laughing] - Sugar, do you see those guys over there? - Huh? - Those guys over there. I think they're following us. - Where are they-- - No, no, no. Don't look. Look at them in the mirror. Those are the same guys in that clothing store. - I don't know. I can't tell what they look like. God, why don't they just come over and talk to us. Oh, God. They look like creeps. - Or cops. Oh, we got to get out of here. - God, I knew you shouldn't have messed with that necklace! - We didn't do anything. - I know, I know. I don't think they're following us. - I knew we should not have gone down this alley. We should have stayed on the street where there were people around us. - OK. OK. They're right behind us. I think they're cops. Let's go. - Run! [panting] [grunts] [panting] [horns beeping] [panting] [panting frantically] - Did we lose them? - I don't see them anywhere. I think we lost 'em. [drumming] [panting] - I don't see them. I think we lost 'em. - What are they doing? - Oh, God. [whimpering] [coughing] - I don't know. Do you see 'em? - No. I don't see anybody. Oh my-- [screaming] [panting] - Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. [grunting] [panting] [engine starting] [whimpering] - I'm Sid. I asked Willie and Repo to bring you here. I hope they haven't upset you. That coin you're wearing. May I see it? - What do you mean? - We've been watching you for some time. Please, I just want to see it. Where did you get this? - I don't remember. - This coin means a lot to our investigation. Where did you get it? - I don't remember. - Please try. Did you find it? We don't want to pry. We just need to know. Where? - I don't remember. - Well, maybe you need some help remembering. [slapping] - Stop it. - (SCREAMING) Where did you get it?! Do you remember now? - I don't remember. - Wait a minute. I'll tell you. - Where? - It was a long time ago. We went to this island for a vacation. We were 10 years old. [giggling] [screaming] - Man overboard! Man overboard! [screaming] - Hey, sir. Sorry if they scared you, Captain. They're always up to something. - Ain't had a proper bringing up. - Sugar, Bobbylee, get the hell up. - I'm beginning to feel sorry I brought you along, Sugar. - Can't we have any fun? - Can I steer a minute? - Yeah, get up there, I'll show you how. All right. Grab a hold of those. And this is what we do. This is the compass. That's what we steer by. See this down here, that line? - Yeah. - Keep that right there at 220. - You guys know where we can get our tanks filled? - Ha! I get mine filled at Macy's Pub every night. - No, I mean our scuba tanks. - Huh. If God had wanted you to swim underwater, he'd have given you wings. [laughing] - Ain't many divers come this way, so there's ain't much need for no air. - We appreciate the lift, man. We never would have made it in that crate. - My pleasure, son. Just remember, if you're not here next week when we come by, you're stuck for two more weeks. - We'll be here. Don't worry about it. And uh, we need air. - Check with Mac and Pete. They'll show you on the chart. - OK. Thank you, man. - Now, there's a place that fills air at Chub Kay. Jebediah's grandson does it. - You said Chub Kay? Where's that? - You can't get there from here. [laughing] Ain't no place to go anyway. That's the Devil's Triangle. - You guys believe those stories? - Ain't no stories at all. - Nope. Ain't no stories because the people who went there ain't come back to tell no story. - Nobody lives on those islands? - Oh, just Jebediah and his family. - Then it must be safe enough if they're still there. - Can you hand me them charts? - Charts. [giggling] - Come on. [giggling] - All right, Bobbylee. Hand me that chart. [giggling] - All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Really give me the damn chart. - You won't push me away when my boobs get bigger. [giggling] - Ta-da. Now, Mac, can you show me where Chub Kay is? - Sure can. - When are we gonna eat? - In a minute. We're getting directions. - I'm hungry. - What's new? - Ha. - All right. Bring that boat aboard. Stow it up forward. Right away. Let's go. - Don't tear those bags apart, Bobbylee. - She wants to see if you've got it. - Got what? - Feminine protection. [screaming] - All right. Come on, Sugar. Come on. [screaming] - Come on, over here. Come on, it's OK. It's OK. Come on. - Hope you had your pad on. There's sharks out there. - All right. It's all right. - We don't have time for swimming. We've gotta get rowing. [engine starting] - You got air? - Sure do. Shut her down. You got cards? - Credit? - No, certification, stupid. Yeah, we got him. - Well, you're not too smart either, muscle head. - He's cute, though. [birds chirping] - Where's the best diving? - That depends. Fish, lobster, or treasure? - Fish. - Treasure. - Lobster. - Fish first, lobster second. - Why not treasure? - Just set 'em on up there. - All right. - What's that? - Oh, just an old coin Gramps give me. I punched a hole through it with a nail. - Todd, did you see that? - So what? - That's a Spanish doubloon. - Gimme a break. - That's what Gramps said it was. He finds 'em down by the caves. That's the last one. I gotta have $5 for filling 'em. - All right, troop. Let's go. - Wait, you guys. Wait, John, John, wait up. Look, we oughta go look for that treasure. - You heard what those old men said about Jebediah. He'll shoot us. - Not if we go with that kid. - Maybe. - What time do you close here? - I was closing when I seen you coming. - Do you need a lift? - Nope. Gramps don't want nobody hangin' around. - OK. - Maybe we could follow him. - At that speed? - Oh, come on. We could tow you a little ways. Your grandfather won't even see that. - Sure, throw us your rope. - Oh, I don't know. If I caught, I'd catch hell for sure. - He won't even know. - Boy, you sure don't know my Gramps. He's got eyes in the back of his head. - Come on. We'll tow you a little ways. - Yeah! Come on! [boat engine] - Where do you go to school around here? - I don't. Granny says she can give me all the schoolin' I need. Says there ain't nothing you need but the three R's: reading, writing, and 'rithmetic. - Todd don't go to school either. He dropped out. - Well, thank you, Bobbylee. - Sugar says he dropped out because he wants to marry me. - Todd, how come you didn't tell me you were kinky? I think it's kind of exciting. - What is this? Pick on Todd day? He's easy? Lighten up, you guys. - Oh, Todd. Did you forget last night already? - Hey, bud, can you tell me where your grandfather found that coin. - Ain't never showed me, 'cause it's too dangerous to go there. - How is it dangerous? - Because you got to walk across the island, and then if then you don't get back before dark, the night ghost will get you. - Well, how come your granddad's still safe? - Because he made a deal with the devil? At least that's what he says. - He won't shoot us, will he? - He might just shoot me. Won't shoot you. - What's the matter, boy? Break an arm? - No, sir! No, sir! - It's our fault, sir. He told us you'd be angry, but we insisted. - He's big enough to handle himself. Just plain lazy. No good for nuthin' at times. Whilst you're here, you'd just as well say hello to Granny. She don't see no one for months at a spell. Get moving, boy. Ain't going to do you no good to hang back. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'll just tie up the boat and come along. - Is this the place? - We can't tell. I think those are the rocks over here where the guy dropped us off. - Is this the place, or are you just lying again? - What about you? Anything look familiar here? - I don't remember. - This is the only island within 300 miles. If you've been bullshitting me... - Willie, pull into that cove over there. Then we'll get the straight story from these two. There's nothing here. - I can't tell. - There used to be a dock. - Yeah, there should be a trail over here, leading up to a house. - Now, we're going to get off this boat and we're going to find that house. And if we don't, I'm gonna bash in your brains. - Would you just take your hands off of me? [laughing] - You'll get a lot more of that from Repo before the day's through, honey. [laughing] I'll take you for myself. [birds chirping] - Willie! - What? - What the hell you doin'? - I'm having a problem with the anchor. - Well, get it fixed and come on! Get your butt moving before you get lost. - All right, I'm coming. [birds chirping] - Sid! Sid! - Nice of you to join us. - I'm sorry. The anchor got stuck. - You shit. Come here, you. Come here! Where is it? Where is it?! - That way. - Come on. Get going. - Hold it. Something's out there. I saw somebody. - What? - I thought I heard something. - I didn't. Let's go. - The house was right up here. - What the hell is this? There's no house. - No, I swear this is the place. - Come on. [gunshot] - Where is it? Talk or I'll kill her. Now! - Wait. My sisters and friends were really interested in finding some treasure. Jimmer's grandfather knew where it was so we went across the other side of the island, where they live. They seemed like such nice people. - Nice spot you got here. - Yeah, a good one. Don't hide behind your Granny. She won't do you no good. Hand me that switch. - Now, Jebediah, you can at least wait until the company leaves. - I'm switching him 'cause we got company. - And I'm glad he done it. Now, mind your manners and ask them in for a spell. I just made some herbal tea. Do you children drink tea? - What the heck? I've never had herbal tea. - Very tasty, son. - Where's the money bag, boy? - Oh, shucks, Gramps. I left it back at the boat. I'll fetch it. - If you lose that one, you'll just have to cut another. - Come on. Maybe he'll forget about it. [fire crackling] - Oh... I just love antiques! - Most everything here was made by Jebediah. - This is dynamite! - It was a wedding present from Granny's daddy. It's very old. - Sit down, children. Have some tea. - Hey, you guys have some tea. I'm gonna go check on the girls. They've been gone a long time. - I'll go with you. - No, just stay here. I'm sure it's all right. They're always up to practical jokes, and-- - Have some tea. Jimmer will keep them out of trouble. - No, I'd better go check. [birds chirping] - The boat smells like gas. - Really bad? - So bad we couldn't get in where the food was. - Well, that's good anyway. I'll check the boat. Don't worry about it. - Smells like a busted gas line to me. I seen them before. I wouldn't go anywheres near it yet. - I just can't get over how the world's changing around. Why, you children are just like babies on that big blue ocean. My Daddy would never let us children go when we were that age. Terrible things can happen. Well, I guess youse children are hungry. I don't know what's the matter with me. Must be my old age. I just ain't thinking like I used to. - Oh, granny, it's just cause you ain't used to having company. Mustn't let you visit too long, Granny. These young'uns got friends waiting outside somewheres. - Oh, but Jebediah, you always let me visit longer than this. - Ain't always in a hurry. Now, granny, I'll send Junior in to help you clean up. - All right. My, what pretty hair. My, my. You gotta be careful with such a pretty face. [humming] - Come on down here, boy. Your Mommy needs some help with them kids. Now, get up and scoot on in there. - Can you see what's wrong? - No, but I'll bet it's out of gas. It looks like it's all drained into the bilge. Maybe Gramps has some gas, if he can find the leak. - I'll have to look at it after some of this gas evaporates. It's too dangerous now. - Well, can you fix it? - If I don't, we have a long row home. - Can't row that far. Gotta fix it. [birds chirping] - Slow down, you guys. I'm not a mountain goat. - Then what kind of a goat are you? - Ha, ha, very funny. - It sure is a beautiful sight. - Yeah. We could get married here and stay here forever. - Cool it, Bobbylee. - Or maybe just live together in sin. [giggling] [gunfire] [explosion] - Shit. - Now that was right pretty. Ain't going nowhere now. [crying] - All right. Crying's not going to help. - But everything's ruined. - All right. Stay here, pick up the clothes. Now, I'm gonna go get the others. - Why don't you-- - No, you stay here. - --the house. - Stay here. I don't want them to panic. [crying] [creaking] [birds chirping] - (SINGING) Bringing in the sheaths. Bringing in the sheaths. We shall be re-- - Everything is tidied up, I see. - The other boy is coming back. - You reckon he'll want some tea? - No. His boat done blowed higher than a kite. - Oh, no. - Don't 'spect he's thinking of tea. [knocking] - Come in, child. - Where is everybody? - Said they wanted to walk around a bit. Walked back that way over toward Pirates Cove. Hope they's OK. I heard a big noise a whiles back. - That was my boat blowing up. - Oh, my land's sake. My, my. [tsking] - What in the world are you little children going to do without a boat? I always said that gas was a mighty dangerous thing. - Why do you say "gas"? - 'Less you were carrying dynamite, ain't much else. - Yeah, you're right, I suppose. You said they went back that way. - Yup. You can't miss 'em. This island is mighty small. If the young'uns come by, I'll keep 'em for you, you can believe. - OK. Thank you. - Come on, it's OK. Help me lay out these things out to dry on the dock, OK? - John! Candy? Sylvia? Hey, John? Hello, anybody? - Oh, here they come. [panting] - It's only Todd. Where's my sister? - Todd, why are you running? - I just needed some exercise. - Listen, Jimmer. Gramps says he needs some help up at the cabin, all right? So why don't you go up there and help him. - Bobbylee, Sugar, want to come along? - No! I need them to help me with this stuff. - Great. The diving gear's all in the bottom. - What are we going to do? - I don't know yet. - What do you mean you don't know? - I don't know. But I'll bet that old man knows, and he's not saying. - I ain't never had friends before. - Now, just calm down, both of you. - I wanna go find my sister. - Get back here! [grunting] - (SHRIEKING) Let me go! Let me go! Let me go. We're gonna die here. - Stop it! Stop it! [crying] Now, listen to me! Both of you, listen to me! I don't know what's wrong. Maybe nothing's wrong. [crying] Now, we have to find the others, number one. We can't let anybody see us. And most importantly, don't trust anybody. - How about Jimmer? - Don't trust anybody. Well, the old sea captain said no one ever comes back from here. Alive. Would you guys stop it? We can't think or do anything if you keep panicking, all right? [crying] - All right. Pretend we're playing football. I'm the quarterback and you guys are the team. Just do what I say. - OK. What do we do? - I'll go get your clothes. You put your jeans and t-shirts on because the bushes are gonna scratch your legs, all right? - Well, where we gonna change? - Right here. I'll go get your clothes. [birds chirping] - I wanna go find my sister. - Just hold your horses. It's gettin' dark and we have to start surviving. Now, I'm going to go try to find a weapon and get the backpacks. And you guys just stay here, all right? - You're all wet. [rumbling] [screaming] [clattering] [whimpering] - Mommy! - It's OK, baby. It's OK. - I want my sister. [crying] [screaming] - I think it's over. - Where are we? - They locked us in some shed. That herbal tea the old lady gave us? It was some kind of drug. [banjo playing] - Where's Sylvia? - I don't know. [banjo playing] - What are you doing? - I'm going down here. I'm looking. - What are you, nuts? Get out of there. - I'm looking for someone. Someone who's down here. - You're not thinking right. Don't leave me up here. [heart beating] [eerie music] [screaming] [door shutting] [banjo music] [screaming] [crickets] - All right. We can check it out from here. - OK. - Tell us the truth, Todd. What's really going on? - What do I look like, a psychic? You don't see John and the girls, do ya? - No, but I bet they're inside, waiting for us. - All right. Maybe. What if these farmers are some kind of freaks? - I'm cold. - OK. It's probably shock. Let me get something around you. [gasping] - OK, we can't be heard from now on. Just be real quiet. [crickets] [rustling] - Them kids can be ornery, but them bugs is downright mean, so tie 'em tight, Granny. [crickets] [gunshots] [screaming] [creaking] - What you shooting at, Jeb? - Oh, nothin' much. Something in a tree. Why ain't you helping your granny, boy? I'm talking to you, boy. Look at me. Why ain't you helpin'? - They's friends, Gramps. Why can't we just let them go? - What about the others? You think they ain't going to call the police about the others? You've got a screw loose in your head? - No, sir. It's just that they seem so nice. - You don't know, boy. They're all dangerous. - All right. They're not in the cabin which means we have to start looking for them. [whimpering] First we have to find someplace to go though. I'm gonna take you guys down here. [panting] - Where's my sister? - OK. If this is the house, there's a refrigeration shed, there's a woodshed, and there's an outhouse. You guys take a flashlight and check those areas and I'm going to make the old men watch me. - I'm too scared to move. - That old bastard shot at you! - I know, and that's why I'm scared. - Come on, Bobbylee, we could do it. - Speak for yourself, Sugar. I'm scared shitless. - Good. It'll keep you out of trouble. Now, when I get the old man watching me, you guys move. Got it? All right, now get going. [crickets] [creepy music] [knocking] - Don't pay attention to the kid. Finish making them torches. [gunfire] Ain't no one holdin' on to that light. Right. I got him for sure that time. [crickets] - One step closer, old man, and I'll nail your ass. [crickets] [creaking] - Ew! Yuck! Don't they ever wash this thing? - Come on, Sugar. [crickets] - Oh, where are you, John? I need your help, man. Come on. [crickets] [screaming] - Quiet. Sounds like the young'un got some help outside. Junior, go out in back and see if there's anybody there. - That's too dangerous for Junior. - What's too dangerous? Them babies with nothing but their hands? Ain't none of them or all of them hurt Junior. Now git, boy. [whimpering] [creaking] Hello? [thudding] [grunting] [thudding] [grunting] - Run, Sugar, Run! [crickets] [creaking] [screaming] - Junior? [startling music] [shrieking] - I'm over here! This way! This way! - Candy! Candy! She's dead! She's dead! - Bring her inside. [whimpering] - Candy! Candy! She's dead! She's dead! - Come on. No, she's not. Come on. Don't cry. - No, I saw her! And John and Sylvia. They're all dead. Now they'll kill Sugar. Can't we do something? - Yeah, yeah. We'll do something. Come on. [crickets] [screaming] [screaming] - You rotten son of a bitch! I swear I'm I'm gonna kill you! - Now, come and get 'er. [grunting] [panting] [grunting] - Now, you listen to me! This cannot get any worse unless you and me die. - No. [crying] [screaming] - Ain't gotta hurt her, do you, Gramps? - I told you to sit down and shut up. - But Gramps, she's crying 'cause it's hurts. - Granny, get this young'un out of my way or I'll tan him. - You can tan me, if you let her go. - I ain't gonna speak to you again. [screaming] - OK. You remember that generator behind the house? - Mm-hm. - OK. You have to get there and you have to get back. All right? OK. When you get back there, there's usually two buttons, one that makes it go, and one that turns it off. You hit one. If nothing happens, hit the other one. Now, as soon as that sucker goes off, you get back here as quick as you can, got it? [crying] - You know better than to sass your Gramps. Why don't you come out here and have some cookies? - I don't want any cookies. - Mind your manners, boy, or you'll have a lot more than bumps to worry about. [whimpering] [gunshot] - Jimmer, go start the generator. I've done got him. [crickets] - Fuck you, old man. I can still be a hero. [crickets] [crying] [shouting] - Missed me, sucker! [gunshot] [whimpering] - Get up. Go, run. [whimpering] - I can't. I can't feel my feet. - Oh, shit. Then crawl. Come on. - (SINGING) Hand me down my walking cane. Hand me down my walking cane. Hand me down. [panting] You ain't going nowhere, boy, so you just as well drop than young'un and come with me. Let go of that young'un. [grunting] You can get up now, Junior. Carry that one into the cooler. I'll be there in a minute. Make sure you lock the door. [crying] Now, you babies can come into the cabin and get cleaned up some. Granny'd be glad to have some company. You won't get hurt none. - Oh, my God! Oh, my... - Granny, we're about all done. Them little ones is out yet, but we ain't got nothing to worry about. What do you got in the pot? - Oh, Jebediah, you're just like your daddy. A little bit of work and the hungers get to you. Now, these are greens from my garden, so you set a spell and I'll dish 'em right up. - I'll check to see if Junior's got 'em locked up. And then I'll have some vittles. Jimmer? Get to the table and your Granny'll give you something to eat. You'll feel better after you get something under your belt. [thudding] [panting] - Why ain't ya eatin', Jimmer? - I ain't too hungry. - Makes all the more for the rest of us. - Well, he was having too much fun with all the excitements and goings on tonight. Gets a fella off their feet half the time. - Sure do. He'll be fine. Someday, he'll be as fine a man as his grandpa. [thudding] - Mighty tasty, Granny. Reckon I'll go out and take care of that other one out there now. No need to have him banging on the door all night. - Gotta have dessert, Jebediah. I done made your favorite. Cooked rice with honey and molasses. - All right. Bring it on, Granny. You can't have none, boy, because you didn't eat your greens. Gotta have a clean plate to eat dessert. [thudding] [thudding] [clanging] [panting] [thudding] You can go hang up that noise maker out there, if you like. No need to have him suffer no more. Now, don't go letting him out. I'll come out and see how you've done directly. [squeaking] [crickets] [grunting] [banging] [thudding] [screaming] - Outta the way, Junior! [muttering] - Pa...? [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] [crying] - Oh, my God. - Granny! I didn't mean to hurt you, Granny. Honest! - You know, you can go back with us if you want. - I can manage myself here. - It' be nice if you came back with this. - Gramps says-- I guess it don't matter what Gramps says no more. [whimpering] - In the end, there were just the four of us left. Me, Bobbylee, Todd, and Jimmer. I don't even know what happened to Jimmer. And when the old man came to pick us up, our bodies were unconscious on the shore. The other bodies were never found. - Something's out there! I saw somebody! - There's nobody on this damn island but us. - Hey, you heard the girl. She said they never found those dead people. - Heh. And you believe all that crap? - I'm telling you, Sid, I saw something. - It's just your imagination. - There's something really strange about this island, Sid. Let's just get out of here. Knock it off! Will you get it through that thick head of yours? We came here for the gold. We're not leaving this island without it. - Look, Sid. These girls aren't being very cooperative. What you say we soften them up a little bit? - Sounds fine to me. Come on, Sugar. Let's show them how it's really done. - Look, Sid. I don't think this is a very good idea. - And what's wrong, Willie? You can have her when I'm done. - I don't think this is a good place. It is too open here. Someone might see us. - Huh? Like who? The mosquitoes? Or ghosts? - Look, Sid maybe-- maybe the girls are right, OK? Maybe there is a house. Maybe it's up the coast a ways. Let's just take them back to the boat where it's not so open. - Maybe he's right, Sid. A plane might fly over or something. - All right. Let's take them back. But before we do, I'm gonna get whats due to me. I'll be thinking about how good you're gonna taste, Sugar. - Go on, Willie. You lead the way. That way, any ghosts we meet will get you first. [laughing] Go on. - Bobbylee is mine. We just got to look out for ourselves, pal. - No problem. - Not like the old neighborhood, huh, Sid? - Man, I thought New York was hot. This place is like the tropics. We need an air conditioner. - I can't wait to get back. I'll be driving down the street in a big new Caddy. Three girls in the back. The whole neighborhood will come out and say, "Look at Repo, man. He went out and got it." I'll say, "Hey, I went out and took it." [whooshing] - Sid? Sid? Willie! Sid's gone! [grunting] - I told you somebody was here! - There's nobody here. He's gone off by himself. The boat! Sid! Sid! Get back here now! You need me! Willie, he screwed us, man. He got the boat, and now he's going for the treasure. Keep moving, god damn it! Come on, move! Keep 'em going, Willie. Go! Go, Sid! We're coming after you! Move, you broads! Come on, Willie. Let's kill them, man. - Repo, let's just forget about Sid and find a way off the island. - You're as dumb as these broads! [thumping] How we supposed to get of here? Swim? - You shouldn't have hit me, Repo. [grunting] - Where you going? [grunting] [panting] - Where the hell did they go, Willie?! - I can't believe we let them get away! - Shh. - This way! [gunfire] [crying] - That was a stupid thing to do, running off like that. You got her killed. - What are we going to do, Repo? - We're going to take this little bitch, find the gold, go after Sid in the boat, then tear both their guts out and feed 'em to the fishes. Get up and get moving. - No! I'm not leaving without her! - What did you say? - I'm not going without Bobbylee. - She's a stiff now! And if you don't get up off your ass, you're gonna be just as dead as her. - I don't care. I'd rather die than go with you. - If that's the way you want it. I'm going to count to three, and if you're not up by then... [giggling] One... - Repo, maybe-- - Shut up! Two... [whooshing] [shouting] Oh, God! What the hell was that?! - Repo? Oh, somebody's here, Repo. I told you somebody was here! [whooshing] - Yeah! Quit throwing things at me! Come on, man! Come on! [whooshing] Repo! [grunting] - It's me, Jimmer. - Jimmer. [gasping] - No. [grunting] [grunting] - After everything that happened, I tore down the house, all the the bad memories. And I've been living here since. - I'm glad you remembered me. So what are you going to do now? - I don't know. What are you going to do? - I don't know. I got to get out of here somehow. - Well, I took the boat from the man and I hid it. And it's yours if you want. - Will you come with me? [crickets] - I, uh, I got something from the man that I took back on the trail. - How did you get him, anyway? - The sling. - My coin! - Yeah. - Will you help me put it on? - I remember when I gave it to you. - I remember that day, too. I'll never take it off again. - There's more. [music playing]
