Ciccio, are you sure it was a good idea to enlist? It was a great idea to enlist in the invincible Bourbon army! They gave us 10 gold coins and a respectable uniform. It's true! With these uniforms we have settled down! - You're so clever! - See that people are bowing at us? - You'll see what comes next... - What comes next? Garibaldi! People, run! - Garibaldi arrived! - Where? When? He arrived just here in Marsala, with 1.000 Redshirts. - Who is that guy? - Someone who wants to defeat you. Am I wrong or that guy offended these respectable uniforms? - You're right. He deserves a lesson. - Let's go. Stop! They are running away. Let's chase them. - Stop! - Stop! Let's kill them! Let's kill the Bourbons! Close it! Let's kill all Bourbons! You, that way. The rest with me. They're coming! - Where can we hide? - In here. Come closer with those wagons! Don't let them spread. I can't wait to see my dad again! With God's help, in two days we will arrive to Cimarron, Miss Lucy. It took a long time. If I had taken the stage coach instead, I'd be already there. - I don't know about that because the Indians are on the warpath, convoys are safer. Those damn Redskins attack every coach! - Alice, are you happy to be my wife? - I'm happy. Stop it! Save your breath! You will need it to scream if the Indians get us. - You want to save on everything. - What are you doing? You even threw ivory away! Those Indians make me so worried that I drank all my whisky. - Can I have some of yours? - Help yourself. - This isn't whisky. - I always have an ace up my sleeve. Whisky, dollars and women. And sometimes a bullet in your stomach! I'm tired, take the reins. Why do I have 7 wives, then? Have another one do it. You're starting to drive well. You're ready to face traffic. - When? - When the Indians will assault us! I don't want my license anymore! What happened? - Imbecile! You stopped the convoy! - He's talking to you. - But you're driving. - He's talking to you. - I'm talking to you! - See? You. - No, I'm not talking to him. - Then why are you looking at him? Look at me in the eyes! - Are you making fun of me? - No, I'm adjusting. Do it too. Don't try to fool me. Since we left, you gave me lots of problems! - Are you looking for trouble? - No, we're looking for land. A little piece of land, don't you see that we are dressed like pioneers? - I see nothing! - He seems cross eyed but he's blind! You're wrong, I'm forward-looking! So you can see from far away. No, I'm forward-looking! I understood you from the first glance. Try with the other eye maybe it will get fixed. I've had enough of you! I can't wait to go to Cimarron to get rid of you two. - Convoy, form a circle! - Excuse me, why? - We are stopping to eat. - Could we form a square instead? - What? - I can't make a circle. Don't discuss my orders! All right, Mr. At a Glance! My name is Jeff, without at a glance! All right, Mr. Jeff Without At a Glance. - Why is he getting upset? - Shut up! - Let's hope we will make a circle. - It's easy. - I can't do it. - You know a triangle? Make it round. - Our rifles gave you another win. - You're interested. Your chief Morgan sells rifles to me and my warriors kill Long Knives. - But my victory lasts one day. - Because you're alone. If other tribes joined you... They accepted the pacts of the big white chief. He doesn't keep his word. He let pale faces into your lands. Indian chiefs have lot courage, they are afraid of the Long Knives. You can give them their courage back, Wowoka. Show them your strength. - How? - Destroying Fort Bravo and getting back Cimarron valley. - I have no warriors or arms. We will sell you arms. Chief Morgan, will help you destroy Fort Bravo without many warriors. - What does Morgan have in mind? - A plan. That he will tell you himself. - When? - When he will come to get the money. I can assure you that the situation is serious. We have less than 30 men left. Lieutenant Martin and his men didn't come, maybe they won't come anymore. Can we find an agreement with Wowoka? We promised Big Chief Comanche not to kill the buffaloes. - And they keep on being killed. - Not by us. It's the Comancheros, to make the Indians hate us and sell them arms. They leave on the ground our hats and belts and swords. There must be a chief to eliminate so that there will be no more deaths. Let's talk to Wowoka. Every time someone tried they were killed. - I could try, Sir. - You're too young, Carpenter. Our only hope is this Lieutenant Martin. General says that he's the only one who has his way with the Indians and is able to negotiate. - Let's hope this Martin will arrive. - Your daughter would've come too. My sister preferred to send her here by convoy. She'll take more time but be safer. Thank you for asking, Carpenter. Good! Food is ready! Silence! Get in line with the others! Yes, Sir! Let's go eat. I have a big fear of the Indians, Miss Lucy! I can't wait to arrive to get whisky. I'll make money playing poker. You waste your time chatting! You're the one who has an ace up his sleeve. Also a gun that never misses a target! Shiver me timbers! Where did our soup go? The soup? You're always in your dreams. You waste time, time is money. It's hard to make money. Can you give us soup? I just gave it to you. No, you didn't. It's our right to have... - I can hear horse shoes. - No, it's a train. No, these are horse shoes. I'm an expert. This soup is more horrible than Jeff's face! True! Ciccio, I can tell that someone is getting closer. - The Indians! - Alarm! Alarm! - The Indians! - Have no fear! - The Indians! - Alarm! - The Indians! - It's a wounded soldier. If I find an Indian I'll strangle him and take all his feathers! - Make room. - The bullet didn't kill him. - Tom, bring hot water! - He needs whisky! - He opened his eyes. - Whisky was good for him. - Can I? - What do you want to do? I'll drink the whole bottle so the lieutenant will stand up. - The Indians ambushed us. - The whisky is working. He talks! Give the bottle back. - My men are all dead. - You lost lots of blood. I'm Lieutenant Martin of the Seventh Cavalry. - I was going to Fort Bravo. - My father is in charge there. - Colonel Foster. - Wowoka circled us. - He is on a warpath. - Wowoka. Damn Wowoka! Always him! - That was my foot! - So the Indians saw us. - They will attack us. - They'll find food for their mouths! He's not a good cook! Don't worry. They call me at a glance because I'm very fast to understand! - My God! - Do you see these two guns? If needed they can become 100. One shot here, one there, one up, one down, one here... - You'll kill the whole convoy! Tonight we are not in danger. - Comanches attack at dawn. - They are early birds. So we can sleep tight. Don't trust them, Indians always make surprises! - They kill every pale skin. - What do you care about that? Right, what do I care? - At ease. - Did you understand what Jeff said? Yes. First of all we must recognize the howl of a coyote from the scream of a fake coyote done by a Redskin. How can I tell this? It's simple. The Indians seem more real than the real coyotes. - We are fine, then. - Did you ever hear a coyote? No. But a real coyote has four legs, that's how we can recognize his howl. Indians walk on four legs when they attack. - But they don't have a tail. - Right. I didn't think about it. When we see a coyote without a tail, we will give the alarm. Very well. Be on guard. No one is walking like a dog, so I'll go take a nap. Crazy, we're on watch. - But everything is fine here. - That's why we must stay focused. - If there is silence, is dangerous. - Really? You didn't understand what Jeff said. Indians don't make noises. Then attack very silently then all of a sudden they are in front of you. - The Indians? Silently? - Yes. - Do you hear something? - What are you thinking about? - I don't hear a thing. - True. - Aren't you afraid of silence? - No, why? Because Indians move slowly and silently and all of a sudden they are in front of you. - What are you thinking about? - Nothing. This silence worries me, it's too silent. I can't hear a thing. The Indians! Alarm! - Alarm! - To your posts! Don't shoot. Wait that they come closer. - Where are you going? - To combat, I'm a soldier. You're wounded. Enough men defend the convoy. Stay with me, then. If I can't defend you, I won't let you alive in their hands. - Do you see Indians? - No. Me neither. No one's here. Who gave the alarm? Who saw them? Where are those two imbeciles? Come forward! Where are you? Come out. Come out! - Why did you give the alarm? - We didn't hear a thing. - And so you gave the alarm? - You said they don't make noises. - They sneak in silently. - Silently, huh? Do another trick like that and I'll skin you alive! - We won't do it anymore. - Go back to sleep. Thank you and good night. Can you close our door? What? That's too easy! You will stay on guard all night so you'll learn! No false alarm. Be awake and vigilant. - Vigilant. - I'll make sure to tell the Indians. - Tom, what is happening? - Nothing, Miss Lucy. It was a false alarm. Try to sleep. I'll be up all night, I'm too afraid. Sleep, now. Yes, but you too. - Tomorrow we'll get to the Fort. - Do you want to leave the convoy? I'm afraid for you, in just two we will arrive before. You can't ride. You're wounded. Don't worry. We'll make it. I want to take you to your father who is worried for you. Can you give me some fire? - Thank you. - For what? For the flaming arrow. The arr... The arr... - What are you saying? - The arrow... - I'll give the alarm. - No, I won't get skinned by Jeff. If I don't see an Indian in front of me, I won't give the alarm. Do you see what I see? - Alarm! - The Indians! Save yourself! Mr. Jeff, come down! I saw an Indian. I told you that I'd skin you. On your knees! - On your knees! - It's the truth! I saw an Indian, with the feathers on his head. He was there. You saw an Indian who was there and wasn't moving. - He wasn't running. - It's not easy to run with feathers! - I'll kill you! - Come see for yourself. We were there, calm and quiet when all of a sudden... There. - Where is he? - Where? Where? Are you asking me? On your knees! The Indians! - The Indians! The real ones! - The Indians! - Didn't we tell him? - Jerk! I'll back you up. Maybe we'll die. One last kiss. She has a deadly kiss! Keep kissing or the Indians will come closer. - You don't shoot? - My religion forbids me. - My wives are shooting. - Ready, aim, fire. Ready, aim, fire. Ready, aim, fire. - Did he marry a platoon? - He's a Mormon, can have many wives. I want to be a Mormon too! - Each wife means a mother in law. - I didn't think about that. I will keep being Catholic. - Scottish man, the gun doesn't work. - Yes, I'm saving bullets. - He's so stingy! - At least go: boom, boom. This is a good idea! Boom! Boom my ass! Shoot, you must kill 10 Indians each or it will be trouble for you! Let go! It's a miracle! I told him to let go and he did it. He let go of the axe. Hurry, go shoot. They are running away! We won! We won! I told you that there is nothing to fear with me. I go rest, I deserve it. Put it out. It won't. - Were you scared, Lucy? - No, I'm your daughter. - I have always lived with you. - I'd have sent you to see your aunt. - I couldn't foresee this war. - It's good that you back alive. Thank you, Carpenter. I owe it to Lieutenant Martin. I didn't do anything special. Go rest, my dear. Tell me about your wound and what happened. I'm fine, but I'm sad for the loss of my men. Wowoka's Comanches killed them all. Why Wowoka is on a warpath? Comancheros instigated them and sold them the arms. - Those renegades want war. - War means gold for them. - We must avoid it. - How? Convincing Wowoka that we are friends and that we want peace. I want to go to the Comanches encampment. Your confidence gives me hope. Carpenter will come with you. Citizens of Cimarron: Fort Bravo's soldiers were killed by the Comanches who are given arms by renegades called Comancheros. Whoever feels the duty to enlist go to the fort, where they will receive a uniform and weapons. Do your duty. You're wasting your time, no one wants to enlist here. I see. Let's go. - Why are you risking your life? - To save your life. - You shouldn't do it. - I have a big hope. - Which one? - To come back and tell you that I love you. - I love you too. This is why I'm scared. Please, don't go. If I had a reason before, now I really have to do it. - I will come back. - Martin... Carpenter, get a table out and put a man there. Some volunteers may come from Silver City or Cimarron. Attention, pioneers! I'm about to say start, the winner will get the best land then all the others accordingly to their finish. - There should be a control. - In fact there is one. After 15 miles each one of you will have to sign a paper. What a waste! Two boxes for a few items. - What does he want? - What? Teach you not to waste. You could have put everything in one box. We didn't think about it. We could have been bankers! - How? - Saving money with the boxes. - Your wives will not come with you? - Of course, they are going ahead. - Walking? - Yes, with 7 wives my wagon is slow. When you arrive, your wives will not beat you up? For my religion wives can not beat husbands up. But they could poison you! I never thought about that... You don't want a piece of green land to raise your cattle? I prefer the green table where I can raise my bet! My business card. Here is our wagon. - Beg your pardon. - How are you? - Good luck. - To you as well. Sheriff, we can go. We'll be first. Ready, pioneers. The run for the land is starting. Remember that American bread is depending on you. So we will have to make bread for the Americans! Get up. Give me your hand. How are you? Give me the reins. At the end of this plain, you'll see a big cactus. Go in the direction of the biggest arm of that cactus. Ready? Our horses left. Hurry, I will give you my cart. Hurry! - We have arrived to the cactus. - To the left. A cart! The door! Hello everyone! - Where do I sign? - Wait a second. Where can we sign? We are in a hurry. - Are you stirring some soup? - Did someone came before us? No, you're the first ones. - Tell me. - Ciccio Spampinato. - What a name is Ciccio? - A nickname for Francesco. Say Francesco, then. Sign here. - Can I sign writing Ciccio? - Here there is just Francesco. - What is your name? - Franco Lo Cascio. - Nickname for Francesco. - Like him? No. He's Francesco of Assisi and I'm Francesco from Sales. - I'm Antonio. - From Padua. - No, from New Jersey. - A foreign Saint Antonio. - There are no saints here. - Are you atheist? I'm Sergeant Douglas, that's it. Sign. - Why are you getting upset? - Sign! - He's getting upset! - Sign! - With an F. - How to write it? - The sign of Zorro? - No. I signed it all by myself! - We are settled. - What, now? Go there and wait. Now they will let us pick the best land. Good job. We need men like you. The military authorities acknowledged us! We are important pioneers! Look who's here. Lieutenant Martin, you're here. What a nice surprise! We arrived first and they will give us the best land. - What are you talking about? - We did the wagon run and win it! Didn't you see us sign? But you signed the voluntarily enlistment paper. Now you're soldiers of the American Cavalry. And I'm your Lieutenant. Goodbye, guys. See you when I come back, if I'll come back. We are soldiers. - We enlisted. - For the second time. I think that the cactus made us pick the wrong route. What a prickly joke! - Goodbye, Martin. - Goodbye, Lucy. - Come get dressed. - Are we naked? - Don't talk, come. - They will give us the uniforms. - Like the Bourbon ones. - No, the American ones. - Americans pay in dollars. - A precious currency. How clever! Coming! It's all your fault. You made me be a Swiss guard, a Bourbon, a pioneer, the federal soldier... What else will you make me do? - Is there something wrong? - Everything. We read your regulations and it's very hard. - Really? - Tell me if this is life. Wake up at 5, make your bed, cold shower, hot coffee... Sandwiches, mineral water, peanuts, candies... - Do you mind? - Please. It was my old job... Drills, marching on the horse, marching on foot... Never a dull moment. - And you feel tired already. - Just to think about it. It's too early to wake up at 5. - Do you have something to do? - At 5? Are you crazy? - See? - We can postpone that. - Would you prefer at 10? - Even 10:30. - Don't exaggerate. - He's right, it doesn't matter. Half an hour more or less. Would you like coffee in bed? - Is it possible? - Sure. Actually, you know what? I could wake every morning an hour before you and make you coffee and bring it to you in bed. - We can't let you do that. Let's not take this pleasure away from him. It's a pleasure for me. How much sugar would you like? - 2 sugar cubes for me. - 3 for me. Actually, if you can, I'd like the sugar bowl on the side. - Would you like two croissants? - Yes! For you. For me, a little bit of milk. - Milk is not good for you. - Just a little bit. Just a drop, but skimmed milk. Or he will get sick. Let's see if I understood well. It's two coffees, 2 sugar cubes and sugar on the side. A little bit of skimmed milk and 2 croissants. And the 2 punches are for who? - I don't understand. - I did! Get out of my sight! Disappear! You speak the truth. If Long Knives want peace, we don't want war. If for 30 times the sun sets without any buffaloes being killed on our reservations, I will go to Fort Bravo. So that a big peace will lie on the big valleys. It's not us who have been killing your buffaloes but those who sell you arms. - I promise I will not buy rifles anymore until I have understood who is being sincere and who is lying. Make sure that they leave as friends. The enemy we are fighting isn't an ordinary one. Redskins are clever, strong and fierce. - They are stinkers! - How dare you talk if not asked? - I'm sorry. - Don't talk, just obey the orders. - If you see an Indian? - I shoot at him. - If the rifle is unloaded? - I use the gun. - If it's unloaded? - I shoot him with my knife. - You don't shoot with a knife! - I attack him with my knife. - If you forgot the knife? - Everything must happen to me? - Such things happen every day. - There's a jinx here. - There are just jerks like you. You! - Me? - If you see an Indian? - I say: Howgh. - Don't do the horse again. - Come here. Tell me the pieces that form a Winchester. - Do you know them? - Of course. - Good, but I don't care to know. - You must care to know as well! Which one is the percussion? - You think that is... - What do you say? - I say it isn't. - Me neither. Go on! Eenie meenie miney mo... This one. - It isn't that one. - Yes, I meant: this isn't. This is the percussion. I was just about to say it. - Put it back together. - Is it hard? - Even a child could do it. - Let's call him then. - The child. - You must do this. - Why do I always have idiots! - Careful. Don't get upset. Everything can be fixed. If a child can put it back together, it's going to be okay. You're Sergeant Douglas. - At your orders, Captain. - At your orders. - How are the new recruits doing? - Very well. - Who was he taking those to? - Who knows? We'll take this to the Colonel, he'll like this gift very much. Shoot and when you're out of bullets use it like a bat. Understand? Hit me. - No, I'd hurt you. - Hit me. - I may kill you. - It's an order. Hit me! - Come on. - All right. - Hit me. - Too bad for you. Hate me! - Hate me. - I will hurt you. - Hate me. Come on! - Charge! - How dare you! - You told me to hit you! - Try with him. - He's a friend of mine. - Try. - We are long time friends. He's an Indian. - Is he? - Yes. Coward! Dirty Cheyenne! You're an Indian! You've been lying a whole lifetime! If it wasn't for him, I would have never know. Thank you, Douglas. Now I remember! When we were children, your skin was red. - I had chicken pox. - It's an excuse. I told you to hit the Indian! I will kill him! I hate Indians! - Don't joke... - I'll kill you! - What are you doing? - You're always around me! What? Why do you keep doing the horse? Let us train alone. No, him! You're driving me crazy! I'll kill you both! I'll kill you! Get on the horse, come on. - Come on, quick. Get on. - One moment. You gave me a headless horse. - It's behind you. - Yes, behind is forward. Get on top, hurry. Quick! - Get on. - Yes. Not that foot, but his. Hurry up. Get on, get off. Hurry up. Get on. Get off. Get on. Get off. Get on, get off. Get on. You say that Wowoka wants peace, but that load of rifles proves him wrong. - He seemed sincere. - To me too. - You don't know Indians. - But I do. And he gave me his word. Excuse me but I'm worried. - If he'd attack us, he'd win. - Let's put him to the test. Two brave men will take the place of the two Comancheros. They will give the rifles to Wowoka. If Wowoka gets the rifles, he is betraying us. Otherwise we'll have time to find out who is behind this traffic. It is a good idea, who can we count on? We have the two Sicilian volunteers. - Are they quick and clever? - The opposite. But I could follow them. In case of need, I could go to Fort Laramie to ask for help. - I could come with you. - No, this time I'll do it alone. - Two are easier to be found. - Right. - I'll go get ready. - Don't you wait for the two? No, I rather not have them know it was me to propose them. I see. You can go and good luck. Thank you, I need it. - Guard! - At your orders. - Have the two Sicilians come here. - Yes, Sir. Get in, get off. Halt! We took the shape of a horse. - They'd make them more narrow. - The Colonel wants the 2 Sicilians. - What did they do? - I don't know. He's upset. The Colonel wants you. He's upset, you'll see. - What did we do? - He'll tell you. Go. Quick. - Is the Colonel upset? - Yes, he's furious. We are fine now, he was so upset that he lost his hair. Attention! We were Bourbons and we had settled down, then came Garibaldi and we had to run away. - Sing. - Am I bothering you? - You're irresponsible. - Why? We are on such a mission and you sing? We were offered 100 dollars and a leave if we succeed. - Are you sure that we will? - It's easy. We go to the Indians, we sell them the guns and come back. - We go there: easy. We sell the guns: maybe. We come back... Sing! Do you think it's hard to come back? If Wowoka is a friend of the Colonel, he'll get the rifles and kill us. If Wowoka isn't a friend of his, he will get the guns and don't kill us. Let's hope he's an enemy of the Colonel. He'll attack the Fort and kill us there. Sing. I don't want to sing anymore. - There's also a third option. - That is? He gets the guns, he sees that we are not Comancheros and kills us. Sing! - Should I sing the "De Profundis"? - There's... - There's another option? That is? - Desertion. Don't you think of the honor of the country and the flag? What are you talking about? We aren't Americans, we are Italians. - And so? - We have no money, we can't go far. - Let's stay close. - The Colonel will find us and kill us. - We always end up dead. - Sing! Can we drink something? Something stronger for me. A lemonade. Comancheros are getting rich. They sell weapons to the Indians and make lots of dollars. - It's the only good job. - It's not easy to be one of them. If I had a load of guns, I'd take them to Wowoka. You're dreaming. Play. One hundred. Two hundred. - Four hundred. - I pass. - Eight hundred. - I pass. - Two thousand. - Four thousand. - I call. - I suggest that you fold. I want to see. - Why did you kill him? - He was too curious. Ciccio, look who's here? Jeff. Let's go. - Hi everyone. - It's the two of you. - Dressed like Comancheros? - We do business with the Indians. Why don't you play with us? There's an open seat. - Aren't you five already? - He'll gladly give up his place. You need a player. - Please, sit down. - Should we try our luck? - It can't harm us. - Let's play. - Money on the table. - Right now. - Not enough for such a table. - We are worth it. - Because you're six feet tall? - No, because we have a load of arms that is worth as much as it weighs. - Rifles? - We will gamble those. - Let's start. Check. - Check. - Check. - I will bet. How much? - Two butts are enough? - How dare you? He meant two butts of the rifle. You like to always be a player short? - Pair of Aces. - 3 Tens. - 3 Jacks. - 3 Queens. - I'd like to see them. - He saw them. - True? - Yes. - Excuse me. - But... - Can you forgive me? - Can you? - Yes. - Can I play? - Yes. - I'll get your place. Cards. - Five hundred dollars to play. - 3 times as much. - Pass. - I see you. - 100 rifles. - 2 boxes of ammunitions. - I see. - I pass. - Three Aces. - Good. - Let me see them. - He saw them. - Is it true? - No. - What do you have? - 2 aces and a jerk. - 3 tens. - He won with 3 tens. You can't cheat, you know it's bad luck. In life one must be honest. Can I play now? Stand up. Shuffle. - Four hundred dollars. - 4 times as much. I leave. I bet the load, the coach and the horses. I don't play. - How many cards? - I'm good. - Me too. 4 aces. - Stop. - I have 4 aces. - How can this be? Are there 8 aces? I have 4 myself. One, two, three... Ciccio, I couldn't do it. I shuffled so well... The game is over. Listen, Wowoka. Tomorrow, two men will bring you a cart of rifles. You promised me four carts. Those I will bring you tomorrow night, with my Comancheros. Careful, the two men who will bring you the rifles are two soldiers of Colonel Stevens. - The won't come back alive, Morgan. They must come back to tell him that you didn't want the rifles. - Wowoka doesn't refuse arms. - You will this time. Colonel Stevens didn't believe you and keeps the fort always in alert. If you send them back with their rifles, he will believe you and will soften the watch on the fort. This way it will be easy for you to get Fort Bravo. You spoke like a wise fox. - Aren't you betraying Wowoka? - How dare you doubt me? I took the place of Lieutenant Martin, I shoot myself in the arm to make that story more believable and entered the fort, risking to get killed. How can you not believe me? - I want to trust you. - You won't repent this. We have no cart, no ammunitions, no rifles and no money. If the Colonel will get us, he'll shoot us in the back. - You'd prefer in the chest? - Maybe on a leg. - There is a way. - You found another option. I'm sure of it. Let's go to the fort. If he sees us he'll shoot us. Ready, aim, fire! He will give us the leave and 100 dollars. We'll go there and say: we gambled and lost the cart, the ammunitions, the rifles and didn't bring gold, we ruined your secret mission. Now, give us a leave and 100 dollars. - Do you think him stupid? - No, you're stupid. We must say that we gave the rifles to Wowoka. Mission accomplished! What a brain! You're a big brain! - And the money? - What money? Those that Wowoka was supposed to give us for the rifles. - I didn't think about that. - But I did. - What could we tell him? - That Wowoka didn't pay us and told us to come back. This is something that us pale faces do. With the deli shop, with the butcher, with the tailor. We say: "Come back next week, I didn't go to the bank today." "This was a short week, we don't have change." A respectable Redskin has gold in his drawer and before any business, he says: "You give me the weapons" "and I will give you gold." Money for the war. You're right. - He will pay only our boss. - The Colonel? No, the head of the Comancheros. Wowoka thinks that we are renegades! Ciccio, what a brain! You are a big brain! - Let's go. - Wait. If the Colonel ever finds out the truth, what will happen to us? We will be gone anyway with the 100 dollars. What a brain! Ciccio, you're a big brain! With these rifles you will become more powerful. - The latest model. - Seem fine. How many do you have? - 200. - How much? 10 dollars each. I always paid 5 dollars. You will have the load for 1000 dollars. Go away, you jackals! I won't buy rifles, I want peace with Long Knives. They are nothing but trouble. Skin them and send them back with their load! We aren't Comancheros! Very good! You have been so brave! Even better, you have been heroes! Do you know what you earned completing this difficult task? The gratitude of the whole fort, because you saved our lives. - The 100 dollars? - You will have them, as promised. - The leave? - Those I can not give to you. - Why? - If Wowoka took the weapons and didn't touch you, it means that he will attack the fort soon. Maybe even tonight. We need all our men to resist and wait for Lieutenant Martin and the reinforcements. Therefore, I suspend every leave until further order. And who will give the further order? - Me. - Do it now and give us the leave. I will give now a new order. You can have your leave. - We'll be fine! - We'll all take leave. Do you prefer, the sea, the mountain, or the plain? As far as possible. So far that Wowoka will not be able to find us. - Do you see what I see? - Yes. They have left. Everything is empty. - What do you say? - The fort has been abandoned. What I see, and what you say, is not always true. - If someone betrayed Wowoka... - Don't let these thought get you. Big Chief Wowoka, if someone betrayed you, it wasn't me. Let's send someone in. - Right. - I will send you. - If you want it. - Maybe it's better with me. Don't try to trick me, Big White Chief, or I'll kill your spy. You have no way out. When the spear that I throw on the ground will have a full shadow, my men will attack the fort. I don't want your death or the war between our people. Let that man go and let's talk Chief to Chief. Ask me whatever you want but he will pay with his life the trap he lured me in. You have my word that he ignored my plan. Why did he push me to attack the fort? Lieutenant Martin, did you do this? The real Lieutenant Martin fell with his men against me. He's Morgan, the Comancheros' boss. He's the guy who sells me arms. Now he has betrayed me to sell me to you. Martin, say something. Yes, it's true! I sold arms to the Indians and had the buffaloes killed. I pretended to be Martin to start a war and sell more rifles! - Did you hear? - His mouth spoke for all of us. We'll take care of him. He'll be punished in accordance with our law. Lieutenant Carpenter, arrest this guy. Let go of me. I can go to prison alone! I won't give you the pleasure of running away! I'm sorry, Lucy. It will go away. Be brave. If you want me to, I'll help you forget. Soon the sun will be high in the skies. You are free. If you want the war, go back to your men and kill and destroy. If you want peace, stay. I'm ready to negotiate. I will stay. I promise you that no one will go in your reservation. You will be able to live in peace and prosperity with your kids and their kids for all the years to come. Big Chief, what do you answer? I will go to the green valley with my people. This, I say. Did you understand? Martin was the traitor. Where are you? Come, it's all over. You are here. Where... Where are you? Wait, I will come to save you. Who is here? - Who's there? - I'm drowning! You're here. You slapped me? I'll show you! Let's clean ourselves and go to the Colonel, he'll give us our leave. - This is done. - Mr. Colonel! - Health to you. - Can we have our leave? That is not enough for two heroes like you! - That's enough. - No. You deserve to be promoted and get a medal. Carpenter, have the ceremony ready for these two heroes. A messenger! An urgent message. Damn it! According to the general command another tribe is on the warpath. - Goodbye, leave. - They want Martin to negotiate. - I could go. - No, we don't have officials. But we are lucky to have two heroes. We will put you on the warpath and send you to deal with the Blackfeet. I'm sorry but we can't. We wash our feet every day, they are clean. You misunderstood, my son. The Blackfeet are a ferocious tribe. - That's a reason for not going. - Yes, enough heroism. We are modest. You will go. You aren't heroes just by coincidence. - One is born a hero. - But can become unlucky. - You will go with four soldiers. - Why not alone? You will be escorted. You must arrive to the Blackfeet safe and sound. - Who cares if they will kill us? - We'll go get ready. Come. Goodbye. Farewell, everyone. They are two real heroes. Ciccio, stop! I can't do it anymore. I need to rest. Rest as much as you want. We have no place to go. - I'd go back to the fort. - So they'll kill us. - What did we do? - Nothing. Being afraid of the Blackfeet we escaped from the fort dressed like two men in their underwear. We are two deserters! - We are two wrecks. - Without one dollar of honor. - We have nothing. - If they gave us a piece of land... They gave it all to Wowoka. - If only we were born Indians... - Or half blood. - Why? - They can be American or Indians. If they marry an Indian they can enter the tribe. Ciccio, tell me something. - Wasn't your father from Calabria? - And my mother Sicilian. My mother was from Catania and my father from Palermo. We are half blood! Let's go to Wowoka and get some land. We need an Indian wife. We will find one, we have our Latin charm! We go there, look at those girls and say: "Miss, do you mind?" - Ciccio, we have settled down. - Don't call me Ciccio. I'm called Wild Horse, now. I picked a safer name: Rocking Horse. - What did he say? - Not sure about the last 20 words. Why don't you speak like you did with the Colonel? For the important ceremony, we use the official language. The trials can start. - What are you saying? Shut up. - I don't know. Let's start. - What are they doing? - What do we have to do? - We have to ride a horse. - Wowoka's wedding gift. A nice horse! - This is a wild horse! - You must ride it. I'm afraid. I'm a only child. How can I do that? Calm down, little horse! We don't want to hurt you. We love horses! Run, Ciccio! Don't let it get you or it will tell the other horses! Run! Here! That's a crazy horse! Let's pretend that we don't care. This way, when it gets closer, we jump on it and we ride it. One, two and three! It ran away. Hurry, let's go to a safe place. See how fast it is? How can we stop it? I'll chase it, I'll get it by the tail, then I'll slow its run so that you can ride it. All right, go. Here it goes closer. Go, Ciccio! Good job! Make it run slower. - I'm coming! - Come under me. - I'm slowing it out. - Here I am! I finally got you! You're mine! Son of a donkey! Dumb! Jerk! You're on my shoulders! Excuse me, I picked the wrong donkey! Where's the horse? There. - I will take you. - Yes, we will get it. Slowly or it will run away another time. Don't run away. Stop. One, two and three. Here you are! Finally! Good job! Hold on to its mane! I'll show you how to ride! Don't move. I'll find you a good bride! - It's not easy! - Careful! Take this! Calm down, bad horse! You're almost there! Hang in there! Out of there! What's happening? Can you explain? Are they upset at us? What does this mean? They are making us a wedding portrait! I will make a pose. Are you sure about the portrait? Careful, he's fragile. - What does he have? - Nothing, he's tough. Wake up. - Are we going to eat? - Why? - These are bibs! - Do we cut steaks with these? - Maybe olives. - Now what? Shoulder to shoulder. Walk 10 steps then you throw the axe against the target on your neck. If you are wrong, my men will kill you. Not at all. Let's talk about it. Why is he getting upset? Go! - Farewell, Rocking Horse. - Farewell, Wild Horse. You're a good half blood. That was before, now I'm anemic. Now that we overcame the trials, can you give us our brides? These were to become Comanches warriors. To marry my sisters you must overcome more tasks: pulling a tooth from a big coyote and skin a white renegade. Shut up! Not only I can't find a big coyote but not even the smallest coyote. And I don't hear the step of the white renegade. I'm sorry that we have to give up our beautiful brides. Ciccio, I've found my big coyote. And I have found my white renegade. Good job! You overcame our trials and now you're part of our tribe. Now you're authorized half blood. You're warriors. After the wedding, you will become relatives of mine. And as a symbol of happiness because you are the spouses of my faithful sisters, I give you these horned hats that symbolize marital faithfulness. Now you have horns! Is he implying something? He's not implying, he's taking for granted that they will cheat on us!
