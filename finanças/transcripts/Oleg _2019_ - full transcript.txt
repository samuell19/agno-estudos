When Grandma told me the story of the sacrificial lamb, I started to cry. Grandma said, ''Don't cry. It's not a sad story. It's a hopeful one.'' I said, ''But how can it be, if the lamb dies?'' She said that I don't understand it, because it's not about that. I started to feel afraid, because I then understood that I was the lamb. OLEG Welcome to Brussels. The local time is 11 in the evening. - First time? - Yes. Sergei. Oleg. - Is it your first time too? - It is. What is it? Brexit, the cat. With a rat He caught it. - Is it your cat? - Yes. - Why Brexit? - That's what we called it. - But that's in England. - No, in Latvia. - Brexit's in England. - The cat's in Latvia. Why was the cat called Brexit? Just because. Brexit's in England, when there's no money. No, it's when they want to leave the EU. Yes. So your cat wants to leave the EU? Suppose you call your cow Gauja. But that's the name of a river. It's the same thing. You know? Is it a Latvian thing? - Why Latvian? - Why would you call your cow that? - It's a cow. - Whatever.

That's enough. Get the fuck out! - Bring some vodka. - Alright. Give us a moment. Oleg. That idiot lost you your job, so we'll help you. You understand? - My Polish is very bad. - Oleg, you speak English? Malgosia! Come here a minute. Tell him I just found out, that I had nothing to do with this and that we'll get him a job. - You speak English? - A little. He just found out that Krzysztof lied and he wants to help you find a job. He can find a job for you. Really. You can? Help me? Andrzej, help him. He lost his job. I lost my job because of you. I got you this job in the first place. You'd do anything to make a buck. Alright, alright. Enough, enough. Enough. Easy. You have a passport? Yes, I do, but I'm a non-citizen. - Show me. - Show us your passport. I can't work just anywhere. It's like an alien's passport. Alien's passport? How do you say that? Like, a flying... Flying saucer? UFO. Saucer. Saucer. Spaceship. OK, Oleg. We will help you. - Thank you. - OK. Stand in front of the wall. - There? - Yeah. Look at the camera. One more. It's out of focus. One more time. You will be able to work with me. You can get me a passport?

When you're ready, pack his things into the van. - Alright. - See you! You're getting a room. Hi. Hi. Finally! Why so long? What happened? We took my stuff. We had to take my stuff now. - Only this? - Yes, yes. No, you're kidding me. Oh, my Gosh. Alright. So, this is my house. - Like it? - Yeah, sure. - Malgosia. - Hello. Remember her? Good. Do you want to show him around? - No. - Come on. She'll show you around. - Go on, show him. - OK, let's go. This is our kitchen. A fridge. Krzysztof. - Hi. - You know him. We have a corridor. Some stuff here. There's a shower. You can use it. - And there's a sauna. - Don't show him that. It was a terrible idea. My fault. Useless place. OK. You know Krzysztof. He's our Gordon Ramsay. - Gordon, what are you making us? - Pancakes. Pancakes? He's making pancakes. Don't fucking eat them. - You want something to drink? - No, I'm OK. Our favourite football club is Legia. We all play FIFA. - Do you like FIFA? - Yes. I can play, yes. OK, we go upstairs. Here don't look. I repair it all the time. But it costs so much work, you know. This is the bathroom. The toilet. Hold on. Close the door. It stinks. Open the window. OK. This is mine and Malgosia's. And this is yours. You like it? - Yes. - Go, go, go.

Oleg, your grandma is calling. OK. I have to go. What did you make? Pancakes again? You'll puke. Wake up Malgosia in half an hour. Andrzej, can you pay me? I don't have it. It hasn't come yet. When we finish the object. Krzysiu! - I need to... - Krzysiu, come here. I need to send some home. Place some bets for me. It's all written down here. How much will I get? We'll talk when I get back. I have to go. Andrzej said he'll pay us for the overtime. - Yeah, he will. - Are you sure? Yes, he will. Overtime? Did you get paid today? I haven't got anything yet. I'm not the one to talk to. Ask Andrzej. - Where's Andrzej? - He left. - Where? - None of your fucking business. - Where is he? - I don't know. Fuck off. - Has he left me any money? - It's on the table. Couple of thousand euros. Fucking funny. Go fuck yourself. What are you doing? Oleg. Hello. Do you have a spare bed? I sleep in the hallway myself. Any vacancies at work? No. Adoration of the mystic lamb is a complex 15th century altarpiece. It is attributed to the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck, who were Early Flemish painters. It is considered a masterpiece of European art and a world's treasure. The center panel has as its centerpiece an altar on which the Lamb of God is positioned. The lamb stands on an altar, and is surrounded by 14 angels arranged in a circle. The lamb has a wound on its breast from which blood gushes into a golden chalice, yet it shows no outward expression of pain, a reference to Christ's sacrifice. Hello. Hi, Gran. Yes. I couldn't answer. I was busy. There's a lot of work. I would have called you back. Fine. And you? And? No, I'm OK. Wait a sec... What? Who came? What are you talking about? What necklace? I... Doesn't matter. Don't let them in. They have no right. I'm in Belgium. I'll give them the money when I come back. Are you nuts? Aunt Lena said what? Don't listen to her. OK. I... Are you listening? Gran. Gran. Your credit is running out. Your phone is beeping. I'll call you later. OK. Bye. Everything will be fine. Yes, I have a job. I'm doing fine here. Alright, bye. Love you. Next stop, Brussels Central Station. I need only three men. Three. You... you and you. Go! Sorry. One more. One. Please. Yes, the Brussels winter. While he was away in Mexico, he watched his house being burgled. - Can you imagine? - On his phone? - He got a text. - On the camera. I don't know. But surely there was security. Excuse me. Is everything OK? You have everything you need? Yes. Thank you. - You enjoyed the food? - Yes. Did you like the play? - It was brilliant. - Yeah? - Brilliant. - What exactly? I liked your part in particular. I was amazed. It's incredible, being able to remember all those lines. Your theater company has never disappointed me. - The audience must have enjoyed it. - They were good. Yes, our audiences are wonderful. Excuse me. You're with them, I suppose? I probably wonâ€™t have the courage to speak to your manager... to your director. I wanted to express my heartfelt thanks to you for coming here. I was so impressed. Thank you very much. Zita. Oleg. Oleg. Oleg. Are you one of the new actors? I'm sorry. Recently... When I'm in Riga I always try to see some of your shows, but my time's usually very limited, so I can't always do that. I don't even know the new actors. Can I ask you a question? What's it like to work with a genius? In what sense? Well... It's interesting. Interesting. It's interesting. I imagine, all the actresses must be in love with him. I definitely would be. Oleg. Oleg. What time is your flight? What time is your flight? I'm not flying anywhere. Yeah... Would you like some coffee? The wine was a mistake. There's nothing to eat here. The shop's closed for renovations. Downstairs. Some croissants. Seem OK. Do you take sugar? I'm a butcher. What? I'm a butcher, not an actor, to be honest. What did you say? What? What are you? A butcher. I cut meat. Carcasses. What meat? Any meat. You're not with the theater? Where are you from then? I arrived from Ghent yesterday. From Ghent? Right. How did you happen to be at that event? At the pub. I was just passing by. I heard... People speaking Latvian and decided to come in. I'm looking for a job, actually. So I thought it could be... What? Wait. - What are you looking for? - A job. Do you know anybody who needs help? I can do a lot of things. If it's not too specialized. No. I don't. I think it would be better if you left. Leave. What's wrong, Zita? - Did you hear me? Leave. - What's wrong? Leave. - Get dressed and go. - Are you afraid of me? - Get out! - What's wrong? Get out! Shit. I'll call the police. Get out. Who are you gonna call? You brought me back here. You brought me back here. Are you nuts? Shit. What else do you need now? Take them both. I am alien to everyone. Has God decided to sacrifice me? Or did I do that myself? - Hi. - Hello. Where were you? In Brussels. - Is Andrzej here? - Yes. Andrzej's there. Come on. Andrzej. Hey. What are you doing here? Your place is already taken. They didn't pay me. Give me my money. Who didn't pay you? The people you sent me to work with. I worked two weeks and didn't get paid. - He's asking for money? - I worked two weeks. Didn't get money. - You want money? - Yes. - You're asking for money? - Yes. OK, so you give me 300 for your special room. You have one person in one room. â‚¬300 for two weeks? Are you crazy? - For a month. - What month? I spent two weeks here. You ran away. Caused me problems. - Calm down. - And 200 for food. - And 300, so it's 500. - 200 for food? Are you crazy? But you disappeared. And I have a problem. And why did I disappear? You bring me my money and I pay you. - I wasn't paid. That's why I left. - Enough. Come on. Let me talk to my daughter. Don't you understand? Police? I could go to the police myself. What can they do to me? Nothing. I could go to them myself. They can do fuck all to me. And you'll be waiting for me. Let me talk to my daughter. Hi, Junebug. You're not my Junebug anymore? I am. Are you my Junebug? Or are you a princess now? - I don't know. - Yeah? - You're not my Junebug anymore? - Yes. You're my princess now. My daughter grew up. She's not a Junebug. She's a princess now. OK. Drink! My daughter grew up. Drink! Where's the vodka? I told you to bring some. Finish the game and we're going for vodka. You should stay with us, Oleg. I will think what to do with you. I'll show you... Krzysztof... Come. Krzysztof catch carp. Fish. It's a special Polish fish. We cut head. Yes? And we make special Polish soup. You stay with us? It's Christmas. What about the money? I really need the money. - I really need it. - Of course. But now we go drink. OK? Drink vodka. My daughter is a princess now. Baby! Not baby. You're a princess now. Princess, Daddy will call you tonight. I have to go now. She's a princess now. But you'll give me my money, yes? Of course. The last time I called, she was this big. And now, all of a fucking sudden, she's this young lady. Not a schoolgirl anymore, but a full-blooded woman. - Fuck! - Watch out! - What was that? - Shit! - Guys, what happened? - Open the window. Andrzej? Andrzej! - What now? - Who's shooting? - Andrzej, what's wrong? - What was that? Open the door! Come on, let's go. Hurry up or I'll fucking kill you. Understand? Damn fucking refugees. We'll barbecue the fucker. Let's grab him. Come on, let's take it. Toss it in the back. We'll have a feast tonight. - We'll barbecue the fucker. - Faster! Come on. Load it up. Alright. Hell yeah! - Lay it on the other side. - Right. Pack it up. Move it! Move it! John Wayne, motherfuckers. Hurry up, I'm starting the grill. There. Okay, good. Get the fuck out with this ball. It looked bigger. It was bigger when we were fucking carrying it. Such a huge deer. It looked enormous. Itâ€™s horrible. You're good at that. Now you can sleep in the living room. Couch is OK. Yes. My man. That's it. Beautiful. - So how are you? - OK. You're gonna stay? I think... Turn that off. Let's sit down to dinner. It's past time. Move. Set the table. Put that down. Wait. There's the tealight. Oleg, don't eat yet. What are you doing? It was just a little bit. Are we ready? The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Please bless us, Lord, and this food we're about to eat. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Sleep tight, baby Jesus My little baby Sleep tight, my precious... OK, so now... God is born... I have a gift for you. I had it done a while ago. But then you ran away. You like it? Yes? Yes. Oleg is a true Pole now. You're a new Pole. Oleg Newpole. Thank you very much. Give me that alien passport. Give me. What are you doing? What's wrong? You're Polish now. Cheers to the Pole!

Give me the pads. Fuck that. No TV. Nothing. You don't use your head. You don't think. You get nothing. Nothing. You fucking pig! Here. Why did you say I don't pay you? Why? Now, you go to the shop and bring me some whiskey. Go on. - Go to the fucking shop. - Where will I get whiskey now? Bring me whiskey. That's how it is. Teenagers... It was the same in my family. Once they're over 15 years old... What about their exams? I can't complain. They did their best. Let me put this to one side, so I can help this man. - OK. - Tell me. Hey, you have to pay for that! God damn it! Where's my phone and my wallet? Give them back to me. I don't know. Fuck off. So... Where do you want to go now? I don't want to go. I just was looking for my telephone. - Cell phone? - Yes. Mobile phone. Oh, I have your phone. You're looking for your wallet, also? You want it? I think it's yours. Yeah? Come on. What do you know about cars? Do you know anything about cars? Not much. OK. We'll try to get you a job here. It's a taxi depot. It's a miracle. The guy's Latvian, just like you. Incredible. He's from Latvia. Belgians... Belgians are pussies. When it gets cold, they all get in taxis and cash, cash. On a good day, they make 20 to 30 thousand, only in cash. You'll get a job here. When there's a shitty day, like today, we'll rob the place. Twenty percent is yours. What if they don't take me? ''What if they don't fucking take me.'' Fucking ingrate. Don't be a pussy. Be a man. Cojones. But there must be security there, armed guards. You need that money, man. You need it, I need it. It's perfect. You're both Latvian. You'll get along. I even called your grandma. She told me all about your debts. You'll pay off your debts and have some left over for a comfortable life. I called her. We had a nice talk with your granny. ''Hello, granny. I'm Oleg's friend.'' Man. If not, I'll drown you in this canal. Come on. Your countryman. - Where are you from? - Riga. Do you know anything about cars? I have a driver's license. - What's your profession? - I'm a butcher. Butcher? What are you talking about? He's a mechanic. It says in his papers he's a mechanic. Andrzej, I need a mechanic, not a butcher. What are you talking about? Just show him around. He can clean up, wash the cars. He's a butcher, not a mechanic. Please, what do you mean? He's fine. Done. Legia get the ball back in play. Good shot! And great save. Now taking the corner kick. Barcelona on the offensive. Let's take a break. Don't play without me. Break. Where did you learn to play? Well? I learned to play here. Take that stuff. Where? And the jacket. Is that yours? Take that, too. Come on, let's go! Put your stuff here. Go on. Yeah, and bring... Look. You see? Mattress?

Andrzej, are you fucking crazy? Look what I have here. Your address is here. If you run away one more time, I will find you. And your grandma too. Look at me. Tell me your address. It's here. How to say it? Anni... - OK, I got it. - I want to hear how to say it. - Anninmuizas. - What number? - Thirteen. - Good. Go on. Apartment? Ten. Exactly. Correct. So, stay here, have a good time. Think it over and come upstairs. We need to talk about something. I'll lock the door, so you can think it over. Don't Andrzej! Andrzej! Your burden is so heavy. Am I really your lamb? Let me see your light, oh God. Oleg, what are you doing here? You lose the game. I played FIFA and you lose. I wait for you. OK. Only joking. I have some jobs for you. You go... You have any money? Because I haven't. OK, so, you go to the shop and buy some whiskey, wine, and... and vermouth for the girls. Got it? The door is open. What are you doing? Put that back. Call the police. ID? Passport? You have a passport? Polish citizenship. Yes? So why did you break the glass? The glass, why did you break it? You speak English? You don't speak English? The glass. Why did you break it? At the shop. Sorry, I don't understand. Totally doesn't speak English? Great. Yeah? Excuse me, Inspector, could you help? I'm busy with this man here. A woman handcuffed herself to the chairs. Where did she get the cuffs? No idea. Where's the key? She swallowed it. Call a locksmith. What do you want me to do? - A locksmith? - Well, yes. And quickly. OK, you can go. This time you'll be let off with just a warning. You can go. OK, now go, please. Now it's time. OK, you can go. But no, no, no. I... - What? - I steal. I stole this bottle. - Now you speak English? - Yeah, but I need... - Go on. - I can't go. Really, please. Oleg! There he is. There's alcohol! - Who? - Legia! Please insert note Please insert note - Any Latvians working around here? - I don't know. We had Romanians. Come. He's waiting for you. I'll see you later. OK. How was it? Did you have a good day? Look, what a beauty. What were you saying to your countryman? He was asking about the meat factory. I don't fucking believe you. Give me your passport. Come on, come on, quickly. I didn't tell him anything. You think when I shoot your head it will just leave a tiny hole? No. Your brain would be everywhere. Do you understand you're a fucking piece of meat? Andrzej. Be careful! Walk. Stop. Take the gun. Take the gun. Come on. Come on. Take the gun. Shoot the tree. - What? - Shoot the tree. - Shoot. - I don't know how. Come on. Shoot the tree. Shoot! - I can't... - Shoot the tree. Just go where I can't... Come on, pussy, shoot the tree. - Andrzej, I can shoot you. - Shoot the tree. - Fuck. - Perfect. Right. So. Give me. Tomorrow, I get some more ammo, and we can fuck taxi depot. We haven't time. Alright, practice. Come on. One more. Come on, let's go. Practice. Shoot the tree. It doesn't work. Fuck! You're ready now. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Good boy. Come on, come on. I made you coffee. The police is looking for Andrzej in Poland. Did you know? No. He hurt you. He hurt you, too. Yes. You should leave. Are you going somewhere? I'm moving out. - What do you mean? - That I'm moving out. - Should I drive you somewhere? - No, I'm just moving out. Stop talking to me like that. Tell me what you mean. - Nothing. I'm just done. - Talk to me. - Done with what? - With what you're doing. - Did I do anything to you? - Don't hit me again! - Did I ever hit you? - You didn't? - What the fuck are you talking about? - Fuck off. I'm talking to you. Fucking whore. You backstabbing bitch! You want to fuck, is that it? - Let me go. - Yeah? Fuck. Fucking Soviet pig! Fuck. What a whore. - Calm down. - Fucking whore! That's enough. Stop. - Stop it. - What are you doing? - Stop that! - You bitch. Give me those. You're not going anywhere. Fucking shit. Are you OK? Go, go, go. Hey. Come. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Leave her to me. Drop her. She needs help. Open the door. Andrzej, she needs help. Where? Where are you taking her? Andrzej. Where are you taking her? What the fuck are you doing? What are you trying to pull? I'll teach you. You son of a bitch. I'll teach you, you fuck. Hi, granny. Hi. Yes, it's me. Oleg. I know it's late. I'm sorry, Gran. I need help. No, it's fine. Listen. You have to go to the police and tell them I've been kidnapped. Everything will be fine, just go to the police and stay there until they do something, alright? Have you got a pen and paper? Write down the address. Andrzej did that to me. Police! Freeze! Show me your hands! Both to the ground! To the ground! Handcuff them! Don't move! Give me your hand. Go! So what was your intention in taking the job at the taxi company? Andrzej... Andrzej wanted to steal money from taxi. So he wanted me to work there. And I was like... like a prisoner. Like a prisoner of Andrzej. And so he... I and some other men. I called... I called my grandmother and she called the police. What? I asked my grandmother to call the police and she called the police. Never heard about that. You're lying. What do you mean? I called the police... No, my grandmother and she called you. No. No, you're a liar. The taxi company was robbed today and we know it was Andrzej. Your friend Krzysztof said that you had the idea for the robbery. What? You're a liar. No, it wasn't me. It was Andrzej's idea. Why should I believe you? All I can see is that... It's in here, you were living with Andrzej. OK? In his house. We know that. We've been watching him for several weeks. You were there, coming out, in, with him. I just carve meat. That's it. I just cut pigs, you buy them and eat them. That's it. I'm not a criminal. I'm not guilty. I didn't do anything wrong. We've been talking to our colleagues in Latvia regarding the phone call you made to your grandmother. She did indeed go to the police. So... We're ready to release you. You can go. You're free. But did you get Andrzej? Andrzej has bigger problems than you. The phone call to your grandmother had nothing to do with our intervention. We've been watching Andrzej for a long time. It's just a coincidence. And he doesn't know about your phone call. He knows. If Krzysztof knows, then he knows. Andrzej won't leave it like this. So... I'm not going anywhere. But you can't stay here. I have nowhere to go. I'll give you an address of a private shelter. You can stay there just as long as you decide what to do, OK? It's a safe place. Here you go. Hello. - One ticket to Riga, please. - Yeah. The next one leaves at 6am. What are you doing here? I'm going home. I've got the ticket. You? OK? Yes. Police get Andrzej? I don't know. - I have to go. - Where? Where are you going? Go home. Adaptation: Craig Priestley Sous-titrage: Le Joli Mai
