Welcome, welcome to the Lighthouse Cabaret, everybody. For those of you who don't know, this is our first holiday happy hour of the season, and you all know how we love Christmas around here, right? We love Christmas. Woo! Okay. Now, remember, holiday happy hour is open mic, but Christmas music only. Sorry, Scrooges. I see you. Okay. Now, anybody who wants to get up here and sing, sign up with me at the back, and let's kick off this holiday season with some serious Christmas cheer. Woo! Okay. There you go. Can I get you anything, babe? Peppermint tea would be great. Sure. ♪ I got my head in the clouds ♪ All my sins ♪ Follow after me ♪ And it just ain't working anymore ♪ ♪ That's just the way... Wow. There you go. Okay, everybody. Warm up your vocals. Show is about to start. There you go. Thank you. My, my, my. That is a sweet piece of Christmas candy. Mom, please. You are due for some ho-ho-ho. Gross, Mom! What? You don't think he's cute? There's nothing wrong with admiring a handsome face. You think I ignored David Lee Roth when he performed here? David Lee Roth? Really? Mm-hmm. What did Dad say? Well, I could window-shop all day long. Just no buying the goods. Wow. Oh, I miss that man. Me, too. You, now? That's a different story. You could buy anything. Mom, dating is not like going to the farmer's market. Sure it is. You sample the peaches, you tap a few melons, you bring it home and you make a meal of it. Mom, I am not sampling his peaches. You're right. He's no David Lee Roth. Are you kidding me? He makes David Lee Roth look like peach cobbler. Oh. So, you do find him attractive? I'm not blind. He's totally hot. Good. She'll be right with you, sir. Thank you. Hey. Hi. You didn't-- Oh, no, no, no. I definitely heard nothing. Okay. Good. Okay. Well, uh, welcome to the Lighthouse. Would you like to sing? How did you know I was a singer? The guitar. Oh, right. Yes, please. Sign me up. Spence Parker. And you're Layla Bryce, right? You sang "Two of a Kind." Yes, I did. You a big fan of one-hit wonders? Oh, my gosh. I'm a big fan of great music. Big fan of the Lighthouse. Some of the best songs were born here, including "Two of a Kind." We've been lucky. Ah, no. Luck has nothing to do with it. All the greats, from jazz to rock 'n' roll, have played here. It's like walking on sacred ground. Well, we have discovered some greats. Okay. Well, you're signed up. The show is about to start, so-- My grandfather and I, we used to watch bootleg copies of the Noisy Night Christmas shows. God. I remember when you sang on that same stage with your dad. You closed the show with "Silent Night" every year. We did. Uh, we don't do that show anymore. Some things are better left in the past. Are you going to sing tonight? No. Oh. On the house. Oh. Thanks. Welcome, everybody. Our first two performers this evening are two lovely ladies. So, Layla doesn't sing? Oh, yeah. Sure she does. She sings in the shower. She sings in the car. She sings almost everywhere except here. Layla hasn't stepped onstage since her father passed away. It'd take a Christmas miracle to get her to sing again. I'm sorry. That's too bad. Well, she's made her peace with her father passing. Sandy. Sandy Bryce. It's an honor to meet such a talented lyricist. Ah. Oh, wow. Those songs you wrote with your husband? Classics. You know your history. Now, I think it's about time you sang your classics, rock star. Yes, ma'am. Cheers. Thanks for the drink. Great to meet you. You, too. All right, everybody. Somebody awake here? Let's give it up for these ladies. Nicely done. Great. Okay. Our next performer is a newbie, but a long-time fan of the Lighthouse. Everybody give a warm, festive welcome to Spence Parker. Woo! Hey.

Christmas present. Kind of makes me feel like he's here with me, you know? Well, you certainly can sing. Oh, I'm all right. Found it. I think I play with more passion than skill. Well, I can spot talent and you've got it. Learn to take a compliment. Rock stars are never humble. Rock star? Yeah, no. Not quite. It's pretty cool to hear a real rock star singing. You have a beautiful voice. You should be on the stage. It's Christmas music. It's magic. Everybody can sing it. Oh. Now who's not taking the compliment? Touché. All right. In the spirit of Christmas, let's finish the song. Oh, no. No way. Come on, now. Harmonize with me. Seriously. I don't want to. Look. I was just-- Now, let's see. Where were we? ♪ Oh, star of wonder ♪ Star of night ♪ Star with royal beauty bright ♪ ♪ Westward leading still proceeding ♪ ♪ Guide us to ♪ Thy perfect light There you go. Hey, you know, for the record, you're not a one-hit wonder. You're just a wonder. You know something that I've learned from working here? How to spot a real musician. You're great. And with some showmanship, you could make it. Oh, thanks. Hey. Tuesday night, you should come by. The A&R reps, they hang out here. I think it makes them feel nostalgic, you know? Trying to catch some real talent at a live show instead of YouTube. You'd blow them away. All right. See you Tuesday. Tuesday. Have a good night. Good night. You know, if you're going to follow me, at least do it from across the street like a real stalker. Sorry. I forgot my trench coat and sunglasses in the car. Right. What are you doing out here? Oh, just a fellow Christmas-lover. My dad loved finding the perfect Christmas tree. He would always pick the biggest one out on the lot. I think it gave him some kind of excuse to buy more Christmas decorations. Well, why doesn't the Lighthouse have one? Yeah, it's just one of those things. Hard to pick one out without Dad's expertise. Where are you headed? Same place you are. Holiday happy hour. A little early. Well, I was hoping to get some advice on my performance before it started. From one of our regulars? I'm not sure you want their advice. They love Mom's mistletoe martinis, a lot. They'll probably try to pass you through to Hollywood or give you a four-chair turn. No. Uh, from you. What? No. I'm serious. You have the experience that I don't. Oh, no, no, no. You don't want my experience. Aim a little higher. Enough with the self-deprecation. It doesn't suit you. Oh, really? What does? Well, that coat, for one. And besides your obvious wealth of talent, your family runs one of New York's most iconic music clubs. Music is a part of you. Okay, but my work at the Lighthouse comes first. Of course. Yeah. Whenever you have time. You know what? Hey, I'll even help out. Careful saying that. Mom will have you stacking glasses all night if she hears you. It would be an honor. A couple more shifts for Friday. And where would you like these, Ms. Bryce? Oh, please call me Sandy. Just behind the bar, darling. Thanks. Great. Mom-- What? Hey. Are you ready for those lessons? Oh, absolutely. I'll just grab a guitar. It's not what you think. Oh, sure. It never is. Go ahead, coach. Okay. I used to imagine singing on this stage as a kid, here I am! Did you really watch bootlegs of our shows? I didn't even know they existed. Uh, yeah. They were hot items. Grandpa used to buy them from the gas station. Really? You would not believe the stuff you can get at a west Texas gas station. I can't imagine the sound quality. Good enough to inspire a kid to pick up a guitar. That was Dad's mission. He wanted every kid to play or sing the song in their heart. And what song is in your heart? Well, if I knew that, I wouldn't be here. Okay. Want to get started? That's right. Okay. So, the easiest way to get rid of nerves is to do deep breathing. Breathing? Mm-hmm. I'm pretty good at that, I think. Deep breathing is different. So, bear with me, okay? Put your hand on my ribcage. And on my stomach. Breathe in and out. That's excellent. Thank you. So, you let the air expand your ribs out, and then it goes all the way to the base of your stomach. Think you can do that? It'll help project your voice. Go ahead. Give it a try. I'll try. You can close your eyes if you need to visualize. Okay. Give it a go. This looks weird, doesn't it? Mm-mmm. No. Nobody's watching. Keep going. You're doing good, Spence. Who taught you this? Ella Fitzgerald. What? Really? Mm-hmm. Okay. Now, use that air to radiate your voice from the pit of your stomach. I got this. I'm breathing. Good. And remember, Spence, eye contact with your audience. It connects them to you and to your song. Don't I do that already? No. Almost never. Ever, really. Okay. Eye contact. Okay. Can I try one? There you go.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Thank you. Want some chestnuts, buddy? Spence Parker. Yeah. Have we met? Sort of. Nate Groves. I run the mixing board at the Lighthouse. Oh, that's right. I thought I recognized you. Yeah. I also have the YouTube channel Music Obsessed, about the New York music scene. But primarily the Lighthouse. I'm sort of the unofficial historian. Dude, you're incredible. It's like stepping back in time when Bob Dylan and Neil Young played Noisy Night. Oh, wow. Thanks, man. I remember it well. It's one of my favorite shows. Every year, I beg Layla to revive the Christmas show. She won't. Thinks she can't live up to her dad's legacy. But with a talent like yours, maybe she'll be more open to the idea. Keep up the Lighthouse tradition of breaking new talent. Yeah. According to Sandy, it's going to take a miracle, not a singer, though. Maybe the miracle is the singer. Oh, believe me, man. I'm nobody's miracle. Well, 'tis the season. Christmas is only three weeks away and the stage is set for it. Except for the tree. Right. Exactly, man. True fan, for real. Nate, do you know of any lots nearby? Uh, yeah. We call it the Alicia Trees. Come on. Let's check it out. What? It's here. You got a tree? Yep. And I ran into Nate, your unofficial historian. Great. Anyway, we got to reminiscing about how beautiful the Christmas tree used to be on Noisy Night. So, I figured with everything you've been doing for me, it's the least I could do for you. What do you say we put it onstage, like before? Let me give you a hand. Careful. So, we can keep the tree, but I don't know about the stage, okay? I don't want to give the impression that the show is coming back. Nobody puts this baby in a corner. Come on! Let's put it onstage. We'll see how it looks. You can't have that much stage fright that you'll decorate the tree from the floor. I don't have stage fright. I talk in front of a crowd every night. Just not sing. Have you ever forgotten the words of a song you know in your sleep in front of millions of people? Millions? It was a live TV special, and all I had to do was sing "Silent Night," something I'd sung since I was four years old. It was the first time I sang without my dad, and I don't know, my mind just went blank. Anyway, I let a lot more people than myself down that night, and I'm never going to do it again. Yeah, but a talent like yours shouldn't be wasted on fear. Believe me, you're letting a lot more people down by not sharing your gift. Music brings people together. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ Wait. It's tangled up. ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ That was rough. Oh, my goodness. What? Christmas must have real magic. You are singing onstage. That's not the same thing, and you tricked me. No, no, no. That was all you. You turned your mind off, followed your heart, and you landed onstage. Ah, well, that is never going to happen in front of an audience. Well, you should. Less talking, more decorating. Oh, man. Gramps would have flipped if he had seen me on this stage. You know, when he passed, he left me an inheritance with a note that said, "Keep singing your songs, Spence, and shoot for the stars." I'll miss performing here. What do you mean? Well, it's just that it's my last shot. Everybody says that. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. No, it is. The inheritance is almost out. Most of the gigs I'm able to get don't even cover New York rent. So, unless I get a Christmas miracle, I'm going back to Texas to work on my uncle's ranch in the New Year. You know what? You need to be positive. Those A&R guys are gonna love you. Do you write your own songs? I have notebooks full of them, but they're not any good. Play one for me. Uh, no. Yes, please. I put a tree up for you. One song. One. Just one. Okay.'Cause it's a Christmas song. 'Cause it's a Christmas song? I love it. That's perfect. All right. I still haven't found the inspiration for the bridge yet. It still needs some work. I bet it's great.

That was amazing. It was all your song. Are you kidding me? You just owned that. It's our song. We should do that for the A&R guys on Tuesday. Oh, I don't think so. Come on. We really have something here. I had my shot. This is all about you. They'll probably want a cover, anyway. Well, sing the cover, then. But sing one of your original songs. Promise me that. Oh, and... keep your eyes open next time. It'll work. I promise. Hey, everybody. Welcome to the Lighthouse Cabaret. Here tonight, we have some great performers, so I know you're going to enjoy the show. So, let's share the Christmas cheer with each other. The show is going to start in a few minutes. You ready? Those guys didn't even pay attention to you. What makes you think they'll even listen to me? Trust me, they will. Come on. Jason? Hey. Guys, the queen is here. Layla, you are looking as beautiful as ever. Thank you. Allow me to introduce a special new talent. Spence Parker. - How you doing? - You must be talented if you're getting a personal introduction from Layla. Well, I'm just watching out for you. I don't want you to miss out the next big talent because you're too busy watching fantasy football. As feisty as ever. Not that you'll ever get a second chance. She loves to break my heart. She is the one that got away. Okay. Well, if you're actually going to do your job tonight and scout new talent, may I recommend that you listen to Spence's new original Christmas song? All right, babe. Yeah. Just because it's Christmas. Good. Drinks are on the house. Because it's Christmas. Okay, okay. Here at the Lighthouse Cabaret, we have a reputation for discovering new talent. Our next act is going to perform an original Christmas song of his own, which, believe me, will be a big hit next year. Isn't that right, Jason? Whatever you say, Layla. Okay. Everybody give it up for Spence Parker. Yeah. This is, uh, kind of personal to me. It's called "All I Really Wanted." ♪ Woke up this morning ♪ I was alone ♪ Might've been lonely ♪ So far from home ♪ I wasn't sorry It's going to be my fault if he bombs. I pushed him too hard.

Woo! Oh, my God. Did that just happen? You just saved me! Thank you, thank you, thank you. I was just filling in the gaps, you know? That was your moment, and you were incredible. What are you talking about? We. We. It's our song. Whoa-ho-ho! That was incredible. You two. You two. And you have still got it. I mean, I'm telling her, I think we sound great together. You do, and that is why the two of you have to play at my label's Christmas showcase. What? Uh, great. When? No, no, no. Spence, this is your moment, and I am not going to hitch my star to his wagon. I'm not. - What are you talking about? - No. It's his song. I just sang harmony, like a backup singer. Are you kidding? That was a duet. There was nothing "backup" about it. you two have got something. All right? Besides, everyone loves a comeback. Well-- I'm in. We're in. Good. Same time, next week. I'm going to text you the info. All right? This, right here, this could change things. Next week. Man, this is crazy, right? This is completely insane. We should rehearse a set. I couldn't even get on the stage. Oh, Layla, Layla, Layla. Life is a stage. Let's just do this. Let's just work on the harmonizing, okay? We don't need a stage for that. Can we do that? All right. Let's go someplace out of town. We'll get out of town. What? Someplace special. What place could possibly be more special than New York City? Ha-ha. We'll see. ♪ I thought we were supposed to be practicing our set. Well, practicing isn't always about singing. Sometimes you just got to get in the right headspace. And how do we do that? Look up. The stars. Hmm. Wow. Gosh. It just makes you realize that everything down here, all the stuff down here, it's small stuff. Well, it's breathtaking. These are the best seats in the house. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's cold out. But I have come prepared. Oh. Never fear. Blanket is here. That's so nice. Thank you. You good? Uh-huh. I am. All right. That's better. Okay. So, what's that big, bright, blue one up there? You see it? What, right there? Yeah. Vega. Yeah, yeah. And if you look just below, you'll see four stars. Can you see them? Like, they make, like, a lopsided box. Oh, yeah. I see it. That's the constellation Lyra. Mm-hmm? And it represents Orpheus's famous harp. He was a musician? Oh, he was the best. They say he made the kind of music that could soothe anger and bring joy to the weary heart. Hmm. Definitely need that these days. I love that about music. You know, we always hoped that the Lighthouse would be like a beacon that would bring people together. You know? When you were a kid singing "Silent Night" on that stage, there was a kid right here from Texas, with his grandpa, listening and loving every note. Hard to believe how far one stage can take you. The possibilities are endless. So, is Texas home? Not really. I mean, I'd spend summers and holidays on Gramps' ranch. But I grew up an army brat. - Oh. - Moved around a lot. So, never really had a place to feel like home except onstage. I know what you mean. I grew up on the stage. Singing with you made me realize how much I miss it. Well, sounds like that fear is fading. Maybe your stars are working. Ha-ha. Always do. Just got to remember the bright ones. Keep them with you and you'll never go wrong. And speaking of never going wrong, head on over here 'cause this is where it's at. Cocoa. That's nice. Can we get two, please? All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, yeah. Wow. Would you like some cocoa with those marshmallows? Uh, excuse me? I'll have you know that I embrace the sweetness of life. And what better time than on Christmas? Don't you judge. I don't judge. I like your style. Cheers. Hey, I was going to ask you. Like, do we really have a shot at this? It seems like we do. Jason digs it. Mm-hmm. He definitely digs you. We dated for about a minute. He played in a band at the Lighthouse. You mind me asking you what happened? Jason really likes attention from the ladies. It was a drama from the get-go. I'm glad that I didn't get my heart too involved, you know? We just remained friends. And he works at the record label now. Yeah, which makes him worse, I'm sure. You see, this industry is fueled by egos and temptations. Sometimes it's hard to find authenticity, let alone maintain it. You know, that money/fame thing honestly really doesn't do anything for me. I just want to sing something that inspires a kid to pick up a guitar, or a couple to dance, or a girl to fall in love. Hmm. Well, maybe I can help you with that. Oh, my gosh. I just got it. I don't know why I didn't think of this before. I got the perfect place for us to rehearse. What? Will you just trust me? What are you talking about? This is going to be fun. Oh. Uh, this is too public. This is perfect. Come on. Remember, it's going to be fun. And this'll be perfect, because-- - Why? - It's New York City. Exactly. It's New York City. New York City, therefore no one will be paying attention. Ah. I don't know. Hey. Hmm? It's Christmas music. Everybody loves Christmas music. You're crazy. - See? Nobody paid attention. - Okay. Hey, remember. What? Yes. Eye contact, and breathe from your gut. Oh, wow. Wow. You ready? I think I got this. Yep. ♪ Come on New York! ♪ Deck the halls ♪ With boughs of holly ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ Fa-la-la la-la-la la-la-la ♪ ♪ Troll the ancient Yuletide carol ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Hoo I love New York City!

Didn't somebody say that the whole world is a stage? We just need to embrace it. Come on. Okay, folks.

I know you heard us. Ah! Congratulations, you two. This calls for a toast. I will have to take a rain check. This guy's got to work. Thanks again, Jason. I'll see you out. Yeah. Don't worry about him. Worry? No. At Christmas, anything is possible. To Christmas. To Christmas and beyond. Is that who I think it is? I think so. Oh, I knew it. I'm under-dressed. You look great. Maybe I should have worn the bow tie or something. Not unless you wanted to look like a huge nerd. Well, I'm no David Lee Roth. I knew you heard that! Well, seriously, you look amazing. I could run around in my underwear right now and no one would notice. Well, maybe if you wore a bow tie. Hey. Hi. It's a great day. You guys ready? Absolutely. They are waiting for you. Show time.

Layla, you are classic girl-next-door, and Spence, you are everything that rock 'n' roll has been missing. Hmm. Thank you. I mean, it was so quiet in here I thought maybe we were in the wrong office. Oh, no. We love your energy together. Layla's polished performance perfectly offsets that wild intensity. We'll need to amp up their images for live shows. Definitely. Get her a more upscale image. Right now, she's treading middle-class fancy. I didn't realize it was a black-tie affair. I will have Jeeves set aside my jewels the next time we have a meeting. Sound good? Layla? Yeah? This is no joke. We can bring you back. I didn't realize I was dead. Well, you are, and it's nobody's fault but your own. You walked away. I don't think it's necessary to bring that-- It's okay. I didn't walk; I ran. Because the truth is, great music is going to break your heart. Yes, but that's why people love it, so they don't have to feel alone. Mm-hmm. OK. Well, I'm not going to wear a belly chain or dye my hair. This isn't how it's going to work this time. Belly ch-- No. So 2002. Yeah. I don't like belly chains, either. Oh. Oh, don't worry. We're not going to touch you. You're like James Dean for the modern age. Mm. Jeans and T-shirts. Women are going to be all over you. Oh, yeah. Welcome to the music industry. Now, we still want the you two to attend our Christmas concert, meet the rest of the team, the other artists. Great. We'll be there. Cool. Do you have a vocal coach? Layla's been helping me out. It's been great. Jason, set up a vocal coach for those two in the new year. - And a stylist for Layla. - Yeah, yeah. yeah. We'd like to record an EP before the new year. Jason, if you can book some studio time... - Mm-hmm. - And some live gigs. Mm. The Lighthouse? Perfect. And maybe go to... Dare I say New Jersey? Yes! He's got that whole blue collar vibe. He's like Springsteen 2.0. Yes, yes, yes. Can I just say that Layla is the experienced one? "Two of a Kind" still gets radio play. That's what I dream about. He's right. The comeback kid. A living piece of rock and roll history. You know, Layla, the public is going to embrace your resurgence. You should do the same. Congratulations, you guys. Wow. Man. I will be in touch about contracts. Yeah. You feeling it? Yeah. Feeling it. - I think so. - You two are jingling my bells. Alright. I got to run. I'll be in touch. Um, I think we're recording an EP together. I know. Contracts? What? You were right. You were right. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. My family is going to flip. Of course. Well, probably not my uncle, though. He was hoping for an extra ranch hand. Oh, that's the best part. You don't have to go back to Texas now. That's the best part? Well, no. I mean, the best part is all the rich ballgowns and fancy people things I get to wear. They were pretty brutal, weren't they? Uh, middle-class fancy? No, I've heard worse. The trick is to hear what they to say and stay true to yourself. Well, who cares about them? I think you always look beautiful. Thank you. Ah, seeing that smile. You're finding that sweetness! - I guess. - Feels good, doesn't it? No. You were destined for this. I been dreaming of this moment all my life, and I'm going to be honest. It's so much better because it's with you. I really think we're going to rock this this. Yeah. You know what? I hate to admit it, but I'm actually looking forward to getting back on the stage again. I think we should celebrate. Uh, I think--Yeah? --that is what I'm talking about. OK. I know the perfect place. Come. Place. Here we go. Here you are. Enjoy. Wow! This is a marshmallow macaroon Christmas tree. They're famous for it. I figured if anybody could take down a marshmallow Christmas tree in the size of Manhattan, you could do it. - Oh, really? - Uh-huh. Well, you're probably right. Alright. To the sweetness of life. Cheers. Wow. Oh. It's good, right? It's, uh-- it's good and dangerous. How are you feeling... about the label wanting us to do shows? Not as anxious as I thought, you know. But I think that's because we get to host a few of them at the Lighthouse, so... Home field advantage. Exactly. So then why not do the Noisy Night on Christmas Eve? I mean, nothing too big. But I'm just saying, the stage does already have the tree. It's-- it's not that I don't love Noisy Night. It's... You know, people are requesting it all the time. It's-- it's a favorite. It's just... Just what? My dad was a dynamic host. His charisma was off the charts. I get it. But you co-hosted with him. And you're great at Holiday Happy Hour. I know. It's-- it's not the same, but you don't understand. The first time that I went onstage without him, I... I went mute. I forgot the words to a song that I had sung my entire life, and that kind of humiliation... it doesn't leave you. Yeah, but you can sing. Everybody knows that. No one's going to hold it against you if you forget a lyric or two. It's not about the song. A lot of people can sing. But a star... a star knows how to perform. Stars know how to shine. And whether you see it or not or you believe it or not, I'm telling you, you shine. So, the label shows, I'm assuming you've been to a few of them. Yeah, a few dozen. They have dancing? Yeah, most of them. Why? Well, ma'am, if you like my singing, you're going to love my dancing. Really? Oh, really. Shall I show you? What? Here? Now? - Right here. - No. Are you serious? Come on! No. It's so public. - It's-- There's nobody here! - Absolutely not. - Come on, my lady. - This is ridiculous. You're not going to stop, are you? I'm not going to stop until you do.

It's just your song, "All I Really Wanted Was You," it's a song about loss, right? It was. Who was it, if you don't mind my asking? Just a girl I pushed away to focus on my career. Thought I made a mistake. Packed everything up, followed her up here to New York, never left. What happened? Well, it turns out she was never here. She was in Philly, started dating a professional football player. In Philly of all places. Ah, but I realized it. What did you realize? Couldn't have possibly been singing about her. Then who? I'll have to let you know when I find her. Well, I am glad that your heart brought you here. I mean, I really value our friendship. You know, it's-- it's been such a short time, but when it's right, it's-- it's easy, you know? Professionally speaking. Yeah. Right. Professionally. We're going to knock it out of the park.

It's really nice. Thank you so much for the invite. - Yeah. - Are you kidding? You two are the only thing the office is talking about. So, what are you going to sing for us? A Christmas classic, maybe? Uh, I was thinking "Deck the Halls."Okay. Great. Okay. I'm going to see you in the wings, five minutes. Cool. Are you ready to shoot for the stars? Oh, absolutely. Ah, Jason. Is our Christmas duo ready? Absolutely. They're going to make quite the impression tonight. Excellent. What song are they going to sing? Uh, "Deck the Halls." Too pedestrian. Um... Okay. Have them sing "Silent Night." Well, what about some other song? Something, you know, a little more up-tempo? "Silent Night." It's perfect. Tell them. Okay. ♪ - Hey. Hey. So, been a change of plans. Jim would like you to sing "Silent Night." Jason-- Look, you're going to be fine. But we're not going to say no to the senior VP, and you two are going to be great. You got this. Hey. Hey. It's going to be fine. We'll going to be up there together, okay? Last time I sang this song, my dad... I-- I understand. Forget the Christmas past, though. Focus on the right now, you and me, right here. He's right! We got it! - Right. - It's going to be great! I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. I just-- Hey, it's alright. How's everyone doing? Is everyone having a good time? Yeah! Now singing the Christmas classic "Silent Night," please give a warm Tapscott welcome to Spence and Layla! Whoo! Merry Christmas, everyone. So, I have a funny story. Earlier today, my friend Layla and I met Santa Claus. True story. True story. Uh, in fact, he asked us what we wanted for Christmas. Layla said she wanted a record contract. Well, that just happened to be my wish as well, so I had to think of something quick on the spot. That's lots of pressure, right? So, my mind goes blank. But then all of the sudden, it hits me. I blurt out, "I want to sing 'Silent Night' for some of the most beautiful people in New York City." So, uh, Layla has reminded me that both of our wishes tonight have come true. She also reminded me that, uh, I can't let Santa down, so she's graciously given me the stage. Uh, and by the way, if I had known Santa worked that fast, I probably would have asked for something better, like world peace. I guess the moral of the story is, be careful what you wish for, because Christmas wishes do come true. Aw. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ And all is bright ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ Mother and child ♪ Holy infant ♪ So tender ♪ And mild ♪ Sleep in ♪ Heavenly peace ♪ Sleep ♪ In heavenly ♪ Peace ♪ Silent night ♪ Silent night ♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ Ooh-hoo-hoo Let's hear it for Spence! Great job. Great job. Thanks, man. Spence. ♪ Lot of love going around ♪ It's in the air ♪ Hanging decorations Hey. Alright. How'd I do? Honestly. You were great. Um, your storytelling reminded me of Johnny Cash. What? Really? - Yeah. Seriously. - No. Come on. Take the compliment. You're a rock star now. - Well, - It's going to be better next time, because you're going to be up there with me. Right. Yeah. Sorry about that. I just, um... It was the song, and-- No, no, no, no need to explain. I'm thinking tomorrow, we meet with Tapscott, maybe sign some contracts, and we'll just go from there. Sure. Hey, can you just promise me that you're going to play them some of your songs? My Christmas wish is to hear a Spence original on the radio. Oh, your Christmas wish, huh? Yeah. Alright. I promise, but I will have to run it by Santa, since it is a wish. I hope you're on the "nice" list. Are you on the "nice" list? I don't know. Am I? Let's grab a drink. Excuse us. - Wow. This might take a minute. - Yeah. Gosh. Um... Hmm. You know what? Stay here. I'll go find a waiter. Oh. Okay. Thank you. We signed a treasure. Spence oozes charm. Oh. He's in a duo with Layla Bryce? Yeah, but she abandoned him on stage just now. Seriously? She probably forgot the words. Last time I saw her perform, she ran off the stage. I totally remember that. She's going to tank his career before it even starts. Jason should replace her once the deal is signed. Spence deserves better. Hey. Here you go. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Never better. - Cheers. - Cheers. Wow. Merry Christmas. ♪ This still does not feel real to me. It's like any minute, I'm going to wake up, and it's all going to go away. No, it's really happening. You alright? Yeah. I... Just a little nervous. - Nervous? - Yeah. I figured this would be easy for you, you know, being a solo act and all. Yeah. I can't imagine what it would be like to sign as a solo act here. Maybe one day, you will. - Hey. - Hey. - Jason. - Good to see you. Hi! Hello. - Hey, Jim. - My man. Jason. - Hi. Have a seat. Alright. Thank you guys for coming in. - Yeah. - We are really looking forward to settling you in as the next artists for Tapscott Records. Well, we're excited, also. First thing. We'd like to offer you an advance on your first EP. Just a sign of good faith. We believe in your music. And this will make a lot of music. Wow. I'm singing already. Well, here's something you can get started with. Here are some songs we'd like you to pick from for your EP. We were thinking six. Let us know what-- you know, what speaks to you. I, uh, I have some songs for the EP as well. Oh, uh, great. Uh, which ones? Well, they're not in here, because I wrote them. Wow. Well, we love that you're a songwriter, but for now, why don't we just choose a few songs from the file and maybe, as a bonus, we can use one of your originals? His songs are really good. Spence is an excellent songwriter, one of the best I've heard. In fact, it was his original song that got your attention in the first place, right? You really think you're just as good as this Grammy Award-winning songwriter? I can guarantee you that my songs are as good as anything in there. Better. Alright. Great. Alright. Well, let's take a look at the contracts. Standard artists' agreement. And we were thinking, you know, instead of keeping your names, why don't we go with a new band name, something-- something with a little pop? Why do we need to do that? Well, we just wanted to keep our options open, in case one of you moves away from the label. Yeah, but I don't... see that as necessary. People know us as Spence and Layla, right? Actually, it's non-negotiable. I mean, we're glad that Layla's star power brought you to us, but with what happened at the Christmas party, we can't risk it. I was blind-sided by that song. It's not the first time. Look, Layla, we-- we have faith in you. We do. Personally, I mean, I-- I think it's a good idea. New name, fresh start. Well, if it's going to make everybody more comfortable... You know what? Read it through. You bring a signed copy back to the office when you're ready and when you have some ideas for a band name. Then we'll get you into the studio. Alright. Sounds great? Yeah. Excellent. Great. - Welcome aboard. - Thanks. Layla. So, band names. Any ideas for band names? Hey, Spence? Yeah? I'm sorry. I-- This isn't going to work. I don't understand it, either, but let's just play ball. I mean, Jason's right. - It's a fresh new start. - No, no. This. Us. I'm not signing. What do you mean, you're not signing? You deserve this, okay? You're the one they want, anyway, and I-- I am not going to hold you back. No, no, no, no. What are you talking about? You-- you've coached me. You gave me stage time. Like, they're-- they're listening to my songs because of you. We're a team. I'm here because of you, Layla. Exactly. I brought you to them, but you don't need me anymore. Everybody saw that at the party last night. Do you know what? I-- You can finally have that fresh start that you seem so keen on. I-- Do you really think I used you like that? Honestly? I am not going to stand in your way, and I'm not going to stand on a stage, waiting for you to follow your heart to somebody else that can further your career. I-- I just--You don't believe that. I know you don't believe that. I don't care about a fresh start, Layla. I don't want a fresh start. I want you. You might want me, but you don't need me. You need to-- you need to embrace the lights, okay, Spence? Because they may not find you twice. What are you... Layla. Layla! Oh, you didn't beat me again, did you? Hey, guys. Hey! Is Layla around? What you got there? Um, contracts from Tapscott Records. Dude! Oh, man! Congrats! Look, I knew when my video blew up, you two were going to be famous! Nate says the two of you are the most requested music on his show! Wow. That's-- that's great, man. Hey, Nate, you were a big part of making this happen. I owe you big time. I've got something in the works, and I'm going to hold you to that. - Well, deal. - My man. Sandy, have you seen her? She hasn't come in yet. You okay, honey? Yeah. I-- I just really need to see her. I'll tell her that you came by, first thing. Great. I'll just keep trying her on her phone. First thing, I promise! I'll have her phone you. ♪ Sneaking through the back? I'd assume the label meeting didn't go well, but Spence already came around with the contracts. I'm not signing. Spence doesn't need me, and neither does the label. He doesn't see it that way. Yeah, well, it's for the best. You know, I just-- I can't-- I can't ruin his dreams. I can't be the one that does that. I don't think he's here for the label. Mom, I told you, we are just friends. Honey, you are living in the past. It's time to open your heart to new possibilities. New possibilities? Mom, there are no new possibilities for me. I've been through all of this, remember? And it broke my heart, and I won't-- I can't-- I will not... be the thing that ruins everything for him. So you're doing this for him? He'll thank me someday. You're afraid to love again. I'm afraid to sing again. There's no difference in this family. Don't ever stop singing, babe. I just can't do it, Mom. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Hey, right there, bar 48. That's right after the second chorus. I wanna work on that turnaround going into the bridge. - Spence? Hey. You, uh, you signed those contracts? I got a favor to ask, man. Sure. Yeah. Julian, give us a minute. What's up? Okay. So... Layla really hasn't been herself lately, and I think it's the party and the contracts. It's stirring up stuff from the past. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure. And-- and listen. I'm rooting for the two of you. I am. I just-- There's only so much I do, and Jim's got the final say. I get it, man, and I really appreciate it. I-- It's just, I-- I finished the bridge on "All I Really Wanted," and I was really hoping to record it for her as a Christmas present. Wow. You're really taking this romance angle to a whole other level. It's not an angle, man. It never was. At least, not for me. Oh. Oh, it's, uh... it's a real thing. Your fans will love it. It's for her first. I... guess it's my way of telling her what she means to me. Yeah? And what's that? She's my star. Let me take a look. Oh, yeah. Yeah, man. Right there. ♪ This is really good. Really? Yeah. Let me pull in a backup singer. Oh, no. I can-- I can do back-- Just to add, like, a little warmth, a little richness. I mean, it's a Christmas song.

I mean, I didn't expect you to take it so soon, but I'm-- I'm glad. Layla--I-- I'm glad. You know what? Because I can't do this. No, no, no, no. This isn't what you think it is. It-- it's okay. It-- it doesn't matter. It's fine. You know, I-- I just wanted to see you succeed and you didn't have to go back to Texas. And my life is at the Lighthouse. I've never belonged on a stage.

That's an exclusive song, and you're the only one has it. Can you just see that some... that someone special hears that? For me, man? Please? I think I can manage that. Look, if this is half as good as what I've seen from you, then you may be my Christmas miracle. This time next year, you could be a star. She's the star. Just a guy looking up. Hmm. Peppermint tea. Cup of cheer for Christmas Eve. Thanks, Mom. I have never met someone so determined to ignore the obvious. What? No, honey. Your fear is not the label or the music. It's a fear of falling. Well, guess what? It's too late. Well, Spence doesn't feel the same way, so let's just not talk about it. Everyone can see it. I have seen what this industry does to relationships, and it always ends badly. Yesterday was bad. When love is true, nothing can tear it apart, not a record deal, David Lee Roth, or even death.
