A curious thing happened to me, weeks ago. In the paper bell, with a "Friday" and several "TV Smiles and Songs", I found a girl's diary. The fact that it was written in green pen made me dismiss it as uninteresting. I took it only to the idea of ​​being able to fill the several dozen pages left empty with utility. I start reading it one afternoon. After getting used to the immature and dreamy calligraphy, I signal to myself that I am interested in it. I am not impressed by the facts themselves, but by the feeling of mysterious reticence that provoke me, as if not everything was actually on paper, yet heavily present. The trivial facts evoked the trivial man with whom I find it hard to identify feelings of renewed intensity, far beyond the quality of the lines. I feel sincere bitterness at the breaking of the pages. I would like all that rest that I feel to emerge, or even just other rambling lines of boyish unawareness to meditate on. He arrives at a certain point, then he does not write further, without warning and without writing that he would no longer write. Maybe he found a better journal, or a better life. The fact is that I kept that diary and continued it, because I liked that life. The following is inspired by a true story. The true story is inspired by a false story. The false story is not very inspired. The images you are about to see are shocking. A family massacre took place this afternoon in Spinaceto. According to the reconstruction, the parents of a few months old girl would have killed the baby girl by drowning her in the bathtub. A few minutes later, they would throw themselves from the balcony of the room where they were staying. Both parents have passed away. Several boxes of anxiolytics and antispasmodics have been found in the room of the young couple. Other guests at the facility would have heard the two parents arguing and threatening to commit suicide. Nobody would have intervened, because... We launched a new hypersensitive skin soap, a foaming product, not at all aggressive. I collaborated personally both in the idea and in the realization. As if that wasn't enough, a new series of shampoos. Shampoos designed for children's eyes, because they don't pinch. One may think, "Stressful, as an activity." However, if you have a job, you must always try to reach new heights. If not what the fuck do we live doing? "You want to continue selling sugary water for the rest of your life" "or do you want a chance to change the world?" Steve Jobs. How great. I read the book, "stop". I lately the only readings that I can afford are job advertisements. What kind of work are you searching? Everything. An adequate thing... Also because I've been stuck for months now. It is also not good for the brain. It doesn't seem to me that you're standing still. Always run. Where is it? Inside the house! Can't you see I'm a housewife? You work! I do not know... Let's do one thing, talk about beautiful things. Guys, are you going to get the report cards? They took beautiful report cards. No, there, there. You start. Italian, ten. English, ten. Second community language, ten. History, ten. Geography, ten. Mathematics, ten. Sciences, ten. Technology, ten. Music, ten. Art and image, ten. Motor and sports sciences, ten. Behaviour, ten. All ten. Italian, ten. English, ten. History, ten. Geography, ten. Mathematics, ten. Sciences, ten. Technology, ten. Music, ten. Art and image, ten. Motor and sports sciences, ten. Behaviour... Nine. Viola, on the other hand, still has to make some small efforts. He must correct two small deficiencies, but we are working on it. Is that his support teacher is a jerk. - Come on... - He's not a jerk, he's stupid. Maybe he is good with the disabled, but not with normal children. It's true, it's a little stupid. What trouble, huh? "I once liked the market," "but the last ones have become mushy." "It doesn't interest you to see that neighbours sell, it's always the same stuff." "Nobody buys and you just burn your face." How much? Like... a lot of money. - How much do you have? - Nothing. It is not enough. Yes, but how much does it cost? Thirty Euros. - Can you give me 30 Euros? - Eh? - Can you give me 30 Euros? - What are you gonna do? - A didactic thing. - Ask your mother. Mom, can you give me 30 Euros? Just because we have already sold two things. - - Okay. Oh, I don't know if it really costs 30 Euros. It could be worth much more. Let's go ask mom. "Aò", mom. How much does that thing... Of metal, the... detector? It costs 15 Euros. Listen. Since you have a lot of money left... you don't feel like... Eh? Fuck you, go. My beautiful! Come on, you're soon better. If it wasn't called "suppression", it was done more normally. "Pacification", or rather not, "reconciliation". Indeed no. Jeremiah, come on, this is a moment between you two, come on. Say hello to Bau the last time. Say hello! With the hand, do hello! Jeremiah, come on, don't do this! Unfortunately he has a disease that fucks his head. Here we go! He understood that you said goodbye. He knows you love him, trust me. Here we go. Power. Oh! He woke up. Do you remember what it was like once? He was always sick. Birbantone! Look at him, he's crying. Better anger than depression. Not at all. Bau, come on, I'll take you on vacation. I am two hours maximum and I am back. I'm going to get pizza. You crouton, right? And a couple of cottages. Play ball, stay here. Don't worry, okay? Come on, Bau! Ma ', that fucking sauce is over! You are finished. I mean, that's the teachers' room, so it's mine too. So that's the only fridge I have when I'm at work. If I put something of mine into it, it doesn't necessarily mean it becomes shared with everyone. Otherwise it means that one can no longer even bring food from home and has to spend the break time putting Euro on Euro in that fucking distributor, right? Come on! Guerrini! Spastic! What do you have? You need an extra in the restaurant, I leave immediately. "My first year of middle school is over today." "For the holidays, they gave us 'Canterville's ghost' to read." "I've already read it, but I haven't told anyone" "to avoid summarizing others." "I have many things to do this summer. Maybe I'll fall in love, like last year." Aò, asshole. Do you take your feet off? Can you leave me one? All right. It's good? Ao, and laugh! When is it born? In two months. But... are you really sure you want to have a child? Fuck you! How did the flute course go? It seemed a bit... amateur. - Ah. - The pavilion was not equipped. There was an hour in the hole before the teacher arrived. It was late. All right. Let's change then. No? So much is full of courses. It is also good if the boys... they learn a number of different things. A little ductility. With the fact that the first lesson is free... No? - Aò. - Oh, Dennis! He spits. Tie, drink a drop of water. - He's choking! - Here! - He's choking! - What the fuck am I supposed to do? Ao, spit! Spit! - He's choking! - What the fuck am I supposed to do? Spit! Spit! - Are you OK? - Really. No, calm down. Alessia... Ale, calm down. AO! Aò, nothing happened, come on. But what happened? What happened? Come on, oh. Come on, that went well, come on. Power. Come on, love, calm down, come on. Come on, let's eat. I'm also hungry. What a fucking story. Come on, don't piss me off! Let's eat. All right. I understand. Here you can't even eat a fucking steak in peace! World of shit! Did you see what you did? Eh? You made your father cry. Ah! "We went to the free beach." "Dad said you go to the sea to be inside the sea," "and the sea does not change, it is the same for everyone, money or not money." "But he was the first not to have fun." Oh. Your baby? I did it. He's in the hospital, though. In an incubator. In late summer I go to pick her up. Almost hot. Here we are! A nice snack for everyone! Go! Loves that you are, to study even during the holidays. Every mom's dream. What are you doing? We have to finish the project before school starts. Ah. If you want, there is also the watermelon. Just don't eat the seeds, otherwise the plants will grow in your belly. Eh. See you later. "Dad found a prefabricated swimming pool on offer" "that we mounted in the garden." "An economic variant to normal summers." "Since many are in our condition," "our swimming pool and our garden" "have become the garden and swimming pool of the whole neighbourhood." - Bruno! - Aò. Susanna and I don't know how to thank you. - With work that does not give me breath... - Imagine... Know that we can leave the kids safe. It's a pleasure, but what jokes? Now I'm taking my daughter back. Did you see her? Oh God... Here it is. Put on your shoes. Here we go. - Thank uncle Bruno. - Thank you. Hello. That fucking pool in that shitty house. Come on, don't worry. Don't worry, Susanna. Quiet a shit! If you didn't take them there, where did you get them? The pool... with lice. What a family of "pulciari", communist ticks. You're... You're beautiful. "This morning we woke up to very bad news." "Go out into the garden," "We saw that the pickaxe pool had been destroyed." "Dennis and I stayed ten fixed minutes, motionless" "in front of the tub torn apart irretrievably." "Only Dad managed to spur us on." "I wish I had the character of dad." "Human cruelty no longer amazes him even more." "One buys a swimming pool, opens his home to others" "and still falls victim to the jealousy of others." "Dad talked about gypsies, almost certainly gypsies." "Gypsies with picks, gypsies without pools." Done. Pietro, you have to remove the balloons you hung out there. It took me half an hour to put them on, now do I take them off? Sorry, but if Viola sees them when she comes back, it's no longer a surprise party. - Ah. - Eh. Read it, Viola. Read. "Many happy birthday from the Placido family." Eh? How beautiful. - Do you like? - Yup. Alessia chose it. - Thank you. - Viola, look here. Wait... Here, well. Put yourself there, Bruno, come in there. - Do you have to take a picture of me? - Well, it's beautiful! The family... Smile, all together. More inside. Brave. Wait up. Wait up. Sorry, huh. - Come on! - Wait up. Mica has underpants. Did you see? Look carefully. - With that "ass hole"... - "Gnocchi with your ass". - What the fuck are you wearing? - He did it on purpose. - I'd go over there with a knife, from below... - Bru '. "Avoja". Squirt in your face. Laugh Laugh. What a whore. Laugh "on this fucking stump". Now someone goes to put it in his mouth. So it should be done, without saying a shit. You take it, you beat it... One day I have to catch her alone. I don't give a shit. For me, even tonight. It is a moment. Look, look how he laughs. Beautiful! What the fuck are you laughing, bitch? Come here, laugh "on this fucking stump". Think of the cocks that break her ass in the evening. Doesn't your father notice that I spy on his phone? Well, with the excuse that his phone has a better camera if I ask him, he gives it to me. But at least once we have sex too, don't we? So we did it all. Okay, okay. Do you have a few days off during the week? That it is between Wednesday and Friday. Ah... Fuck you, bitch... Do you like... Ah... You like to skate, huh? It is also better to get to the end. Trust me, I went to hundreds of parties like that. The girls invited me once a week. They always invited me. Sometimes I went, sometimes I didn't. It depended on who invited me. When they saw me they were so happy! They did not care that I had not given the gift, the gift was myself. Do you know what they told me at work? I look like a thing... To Antonio Banderas. Do you understand who? That of the hens. Who imagined it? If we don't go to the party, "sticazzi". We take a sandwich with cooked ham and cheese. I'm so hungry... In their face! I miss you are nice. Especially that little girl. I don't know, it's half strange. And let's go! Good boy! Hi, master. It's hot, huh? - Yes. - Ridiculous. Sorry, there is a bit of a mess. Do you never stop working? I'm just giving a couple of stoned recovery lessons. Easy money. You instead? Don't give me a break, huh. Do you really want to study in August too? No, it's that it's always the same topic. I just... I still don't have clear things. Luckily, otherwise it meant that you were a genius. Genes have a shitty life. What did you bring? Nothing, things I haven't understood well yet. Ok. We do this this morning, but in the afternoon you don't break my balls and go around looking at the girls in costumes, okay? Bravo, dad! "Daje" like this! Daje! Come on, watch it! How do you fly! Good boy! Yup! What a whore child! You are the same as me, do you understand? You are the same as me! You are the same as me! Good boy! Yup! You are like me! Did you understand? "Mortacci yours"! Slut of that bitch, how the fuck are you strong! Yup! Fuck! Yup! "Mortacci yours"! AO. How are you? Better? Damn. Oh, do you know that I also got you the leftovers from the restaurant? They were throwing them at the dog. I said, "What dog? I have a son!" Listen, do you want to stay here to eat or do you want to come to the table with me? Don't worry, I'll do it, okay? Oh, it's mushrooms and sausage, huh! Uh! Feel that they smell! Look here! Hee! It eats. Ah, I have another good news too, you know? I met that little girl's mom Do you understand who? The birthday party we were going to the other day. She learned that you have measles. Gladly she told me that her daughter still hasn't taken it and she thinks this is the best opportunity. Also because the children of her friends have already had it and nobody can help her. We organize a nice afternoon here, so she brings her daughter, you stay with her, she takes measles, you take her, huh? Are not you happy? Without this thing, you risked losing it, however long your face is. Eat a piece of pizza. Bravo, with me, together. I feel like fucking a lot. The mother of that little girl called, they found traffic but they arrive. Come on, get up, let's go. Yes, it's them, it's them. Say hello, say hello! You smile. You smile! Go to the girl, go! It goes'! Beautiful! - Welcome! - Thank you. - How are you? - Well. - Hello. - Ah! - - Hello! - No, donut. - Ah! - So I had measles. - Me too! Yup? Yes, this is a donut that I made. It had come good... I brought half of it. I have the Viennetta in the fridge, but the donut is better! - As you want! - Yeah, for sure? - All right. - Nothing... Come on, then. - Here we go. - Please Please. Come on, Viola. This is my home. - His too, huh. - Sure! - Both of you. - As you can see, we are surrounded by greenery. - Beautiful! Dad put all these plants. - He passed away a year ago. - I'm sorry. - That was when I was born. - Ah. We are renovating. Two days and these bricks take them away. - Well, good. - We have two entrances, as you can see. - Yes, and we come in through this. Please take a seat! - All right. - We leave them alone, which is boring! - Yup! - Can you hold the donut? - Sure! Jeremiah, are you coming for a second? Look, I put precautions inside the shoe rack, just in case... - Please, take a seat! - Yup. - Make it like your home. - See you later, Viola. - How beautiful is it? - Yes. It's mom's love. It is on one floor. Right, please. - Okay. - You are welcome. - Thank you. - Alone? Yes, yes, because my husband... - Please put the bananas on top. - Okay. Do we do it now? Now, now... What time is it, now? Boh, I don't know, four o'clock? All right. - I'm laying down? - I think so. Madonna, it's hot! Come. - You can take off your clothes. - If you say so... Okay, look, we're not there. I'm not used to this. I mean... it's very strange. All very strange. Um... let's do this. Now you stay here. I go there for a second, I concentrate, I calm down and I come here full, understand? Ok. Why don't you wear the wig like this? As well as? Here it is. Wait up. Here it is. You're always beautiful. Of course, I know. - Do you think you've already attacked me? - Boh. I don't know if I'm capable. Come on, don't be a fool, attack! Attack! It's nice when you smile. If you laugh, measles comes out of your mouth and I'll take it. If not, I have to kiss you. We kiss in the mouth, so we end immediately and I can go home with my mother. Which do you prefer? It's okay with me even if you're here with me. It makes me feel good. Are you reading my hand? - Yes. - What do you say? My cocks. Hello! Drive carefully! Go slowly! See you soon! Well? So how did it go? Little man, look what you've won! Here, a beer. Beviamocela. Ah... Ah! Do you realize how strange life is? Eh? I "hit" that mother on the side I would have given it, but it didn't seem appropriate. She started talking about her husband, her husband's cocks, her husband's job. Knowing that you had fun is enough for me. This is the important thing for dad. If you didn't know it before, now you know it. Come on, fucker, let's drink! Oh! This fucking summer! Fool! Two minutes and I'm going. "Usually, I live the last days of vacation with anxiety." "I'm counting down" "and at the same time I try to stop time, until the last evening." "But I don't stop anything, and that day comes," "Dad opens the door and says, 'Wake up!' '" "But this year I have not felt any anxiety." "I didn't count down, not even on the last evening." "I just watched a movie." "I think both Dennis and I have calmed down." "We have matured." "Dad opened the door and woke us up." "Mortacci tua", asshole! "Bocchinaro" of shit, "mortacci tua", fuck you! "Mortacci yours"! Half an hour! - But you didn't have a car? - I got my license back. And why? Are you flirting with me? How do you think you're doing? Very well. But go shit. Look, if I tell you a secret, will you promise me you won't tell anyone? Like you're a faggot? No, really. What do you want? I'm building a bomb, to blow up the whole neighbourhood. So it all ends. However, it's not just me who works on the project. I am the one who decides things. But fuck you! - I wanted to tell you for your little girl. - You broke your cock! Ao, I'm going to work, huh. He called your cousin, after he passes. That boy was building a bomb inside the house. - - Mmh. He kept it there. He says they then called the bomb squad, who took everything away. - Mmh. Anyway this thing was a danger, but a danger for everyone, not just for the family, I mean. Hmm. I am speechless. I heard he's kind of... He's a strange one, isn't he? - - There are no words. No, no. There are no words, if you think... I mean, really this was holding a bomb on the table in his bedroom. Mah. The father says he didn't even know, in short, he hadn't even noticed. He says his son had told him... who had to do a search. Like a school thing, isn't it? Well, there are no words, you said it right. From '? - From'? - Sorry, I have to leave you. I have a business call below. - Sorry bye. Bye Bye. I'm going to do two throws. What's wrong, mom? Nothing, Alessia. Shut up. I'm on my period. Mom has the cycle. Look, mom broke her cooking balls today, huh? You go to the cinema, so you see something and eat popcorn. - Power. - Mom, 100 Euros? Come on! Go! How was the movie, nice? - Yup? - Yup. Well done. Look, we're going for a walk all together, huh? Dad doesn't want to go home. No, come on, please, I'm tired. Then tomorrow there is school. Oh yes? Eh, sure. Instead, Dad decides. We do it anyway, a nice ride. Dad. Can I ask you something? Tell me, Dennis. But, you and mom... I mean, are you okay? That is... Is everything ok between you and her? Get off a little. - Get off. - Come on, dad! Alessia, shut up, I'm not talking to you. Dennis, get out of this car. Get off! Come here, come on! Come! Tell me what you said. - What did you say? - Nothing. Now I'll show you how your mom and I are. Come here! Come here! How are you and me? Me and mom how are we? "Testaccia de fuck"! Come here! Get up, I didn't fuck you! Human shit that you are nothing else! Get in the car, shut up and woe to you if you blow! Me and mom are fine! Me and mom. You have nothing to say, Ale '? Woe to the speaker! I don't want to see someone crying! It is I who should cry here! "We had a picnic today." "It was strange, because it was neither Sunday nor Saturday" "nor any public holiday." "But we didn't say anything, because the trip went there." "During the trip I suffered from car sickness," "But when I got off I immediately felt good." "I felt good and I was in front of that beautiful green expanse." "Dad, on the other hand, had a toothache and never went through it." You must be happy to have two parents like that. You must be happy. I got it? Because it is normal that sometimes things do not go as you would like. I got it? Even mom, when she was a child, was with grandmother... he could not do many things... he wanted to leave... Alessia! Mum! Where are you all? Dennis? Mum? Dad? You are the best father I know. You are also the best mother I know. I also like to eat only the crust. Look, like this. Take everything off. Try a little. So. However yes, I have decided, I will withdraw you from that school. There is a lot of malaise in that environment. Let's move home, school and city and move on. Yup. So for a while I don't study, while I look for a new place. I would go directly to Rome. What do you say? This campaign broke our cock! It is full of bigots, you live in backwardness. It is a mass of shit. I ask my cousin, in Casal Bruciato, if we can lean on him. We huddle in bed in the living room. It is funny! How nice, isn't it? Do you remember when we did all the nights together? What an ass! What a cool. Hello. Are you going away too? Yup. I found this in the chips. It's yours, I'll give it to you. OK Bye. AO! AO! Let's go get meat and fruit. Here we go. What are you holding? Let me see. What is this zozzeria? Throw this thing away. Let's go come on. Come on, move! Come on, please. What a beautiful sun today, huh? - Hello, professor. Please take a seat. - Hello. Then... He will surely be aware of the considerable pressures that have been brought against us... in this institution, by parents and teachers. Even without... Even without intentionality... it was she who provided the notions that the pupils subsequently put into practice. - I mean to build the two bombs. - Exactly. What could I have known that that child was crazy? The parents didn't notice, did I have to notice? Unfortunately, however, due to the situation that has arisen... we just have to replace it with a colleague. - Yup? - Yup. Don't think you upset me. "Oh my God! Fired from this spastic school!" However, I understood from the way you all looked at me at the entrance. So do little splendid. Well, that's the situation. Now please go out, we have several appointments this morning. Of course, of course, I understand. Could I at least carry out my lesson today? Of course it can. Good morning. Is our daughter crying? Don't you feel it's a dog? No, she looked like our daughter. - She's already a bitch. - How dickhead you are! Be serious. - I'm serious. - Eh! - Eh! - You're the fucking father. And you are the mother. - Eh. - Oh, but we're being serious. We did very well to leave. If she was staying with your mother, the girl was already growing up dead. Yes, yes. True, it is the first step, however. - We have to grow up now. - And we grow. One time. Only once can we grow. Oh well... Tomorrow, as we arrive in Spinaceto, we organize ourselves. We take a pension. I hear my friend doing the "pizzettaro" help. He makes a lot of money. So I make a lot of money too. If you get bored at home, you get a job. Go be a bartender or waitress. Interested now, huh? So we have the second salary. In the summer we go dancing in Ibiza. In Ibiza. In Ibiza, where we like. Amo ', however first thing we have to go to the registry. We cannot have called our daughter as a song by Vasco Rossi. We called her together, what the fuck are you laughing at? Sara, we had to call her. - Like Meneguzzi's song, do you remember it? - Yup. - That's our song. - Oh well... But what does that mean? What the fuck... What the fuck! Vilma. Are you crying for the name? Ao, let's change the name! Vilma... Hey. Wake up, it's four o'clock. - I have to go to the bathroom for a moment. - Okay. AO. Dennis. Madonna, these... Ale'! Ale'. Guys. Boys. Oh God! Help! Help! Oh my God, Bruno! Bruno! Help! Oh! Help! Bruno! Oh! Bruno! Strange that he never mentioned the maliatone to you. Yet it is a really interesting topic. The... malathion. Yup. How many of you have a garden? I bet everyone, right? I'm sure your parents keep a pack of maliatone in every garage. Powerful insecticide, the maliatone. We owe him the victory over the Mediterranean fly in the 1980s. Help! It is able to paralyse the nerve structures of mosquitoes and other insects, as well as to eliminate eggs in adult lice. Let's talk about a truly dangerous product. Given the irreversibility of its inactivating action on cholinesterases, it is perhaps the most dangerous agricultural pesticide on the market. In any case... commonly available in every store. The price is also low. Ada. Love, wake up. I'm going downstairs to work. See you at lunch, okay? The pages of the diary end here. I filled the last ones by writing smaller and smaller, squeezing the edges. I was tempted to buy a new diary, to continue the subsequent events, so one day I went to the stationery store and leafed through several. They were all excellent, inexpensive and completely empty, but I felt it was not the same. Looking at them, I didn't know how I would fill them. I lacked inspiration. So I didn't buy any new diary. I took "Gazzetta" and "Guerin Sportivo" and went back to the summer monotony made of transfer market, melon cut and holiday curses. I have solved this. I advise you to do the same. - Oh! - Beautiful! - "Kill"! - Come here! How beautiful you are, "mortacci li li" - What have you done? - What did I do? - Have you lost your hair? - Leave your hair alone. - You are getting older. - What do I care? I've been without a washing machine for a week, Rosaria washes my clothes. - Still not dead? - Who will kill her? - "Anvedi" this kid! - Did you see? You have become "a cot"! Kiss uncle, come on. Ao, come on! Beautiful! Come inside, come. - Give me the bag. - I support them here. - Did you bring me the cookies? - Yes, I took them in the oven. I'm really glad you stop here for a while, you know? - Me too. - Meet everyone in the neighbourhood. Sit down. - Do you remember them? - Sure. Mimmo... The prince, the wolf... - Look... but Omar? - Omar hasn't been here for two years. - Did they arrest him? - They killed him. - They shot him here at the park. - Ah. - Eh. - I did not know. Don't mind the mess, a week with a fever and I couldn't get it right. - Don't mind. - Do not worry. I'm settling down here tonight. I sleep here and you go to my room. - Forget it. - I tell you I'm glad! Okay, I appreciate. Indeed, we appreciate. This madman was building a bomb in the room alone. - Well? - He did it all by himself! It was evident that he was intelligent, he has our blood! Oh well... Do you know where the boy can make a career? Where is it? In NASA. Will there be a NASA fee in Italy? Of course, of course. Not "piss from the knee". Meanwhile, we'll have this dinner, daje. Mortadella, buffalo mozzarella, coppa, wine. In the face of those who want us badly. - I love you. - Me too. Much. What a beautiful day, huh? We wake up at seven in the morning. Let's go find a grinder. Then we go to the uncle's workshop. But first we do "Corriere", croissant and cappuccino at the bar. What do you say? Ok. Good night. I feel remorse for telling you this senseless, bitter and pessimistic story. You deserved maybe something more realistic, a normal story, of those that happen every day. Not the release of a bored person from life. I apologize. Let's start from scratch. The Malaysian GP has been suspended due to bad weather conditions which did not guarantee the optimal conditions for the race. Big disappointment... - Does it bother you, down a little? - No. Line under study. It always takes me a while before I fall asleep. You are about to see shocking pictures. A family massacre took place this afternoon in Spinaceto. According to the reconstruction, the parents of a few months old girl would have killed the baby girl by drowning her in the bathtub. A few minutes later, they would throw themselves from the balcony of the room where they were staying. Both parents have passed away. Several boxes of anxiolytics and antispasmodics have been found in the room of the young couple. Other guests at the facility would have heard the two parents arguing and threatening to commit suicide. Nobody would intervene because the furious quarrel would be followed by an hour of respite. We will provide you with further details in the next editions.
