It’s a cleanIvay. l’ll climb over. Feeling better? Much. Hey, look, what’s the big idea? I want to make love to you while you’re driving. Preferably at some busy intersection. Do you want to get me sacked? Yes. Why? Because then I can look after you. You’re too young to be driving a taxi, picking up strange nymphomaniacs like me. W-what particular intersection did you have in mind? This one. (TYRES SCREECH) (CAR HORNS BLARE) (CAR HORNS CONTINUE BLARING) (TAPPING AT WINDOW) Hey! What are you doing in there?

You know what I mean. You’re not handsome. Oh, thanks. Nothing even memorable about you. Now, here’s me — a loving, noble bloke that any bird would be proud to get to know. If only she’d open her eyes and take a look at me. But I never get to first base. That’s what hurts most. The inequality of life. Do you want to swap? (Chuckles) (UPBEAT MUSIC) Come on, Alvin!

Er. . .yeah. Well, I can better it. Yeah? Provided the Weevils don’t get into the act. D-da Weevils?! Am I not getting through to you, Ballsy? Well, it’s not exactly that, it’sjust that I don’t really see how the Weevils can get in on the act. Aha! (Laughs) Nowl read you, now! read you! You are thinking of the Hatchet? Er...that’s the one I had in mind. The Hatchet is no dumb bum, Ballsy, but is that his pitch? He sat on the Gas House Boys... but he’s never leant on the Weevils. There’s always the foist time. Good thinking, Ballsy. I’ll get back to you. But remember...whatever Fingers can offer, I can do better! I’ll never forget what you said the first time you got off the plane from the good old US of A. “In the protection racket, what you need...is..." Come on, Ballsy! “ls...?" (Mouths words) Protection! Yes! (Laughs) You never said a truer word! The locals are still trying to absorb it. I’ll see you later. Place your bets, please, ladies and gentlemen. Ah...red, nine. That’s placed. 100 on pair. No more bets. And it’s a red nine. Red nine’s the winner. You’ve got a good PR machine, McGee. Saw a picture of you in the paper this morning. Said you were here to look us over. You don’t wanna believe everything you read in the newspapers, Fingers. Yes. I’d have put it the other way around. I thought it was us who was looking you over. Hey...l wouldn’t talk to McGee like that, Fingers. What’s the matter? Don’t you feel yourself? Never in public. Very funny, fat boy. Keep that up and I’ll reduce you to a quivering pulp. Promises, promises. Cool it, Jake! Cool it! Er...er...l don’t, er, believe, Fingers, that I’ve had the pleasure of, er, um, meeting with the lady. Oh...Boobs la Touche. Balls, this is Boobs. Boobs...this is Balls. I am very happy to meet you. CROUPIER: Place your bets, please, ladies and gentlemen. 10 on red 30. Just keep your eye on the wheel, McGee. I can see you want my relationship with Miss la Touche to be strictly business, Fingers. Don’t bite off more than you can chew. It might interfere with your mastication. Oh, I think I can pull it off, Fingers. I said ‘mastication’. No more bets. (High-pitched voice) Listen here, Fingers. If he goes, I go! Got that?! What ARE you talking about, Dwart?! You know very well what I’m talking about! You won’t find me too easy to replace. I’m sure it’d be impossible. There couldn’t be two of you. There’s hardly enough to go around as it is. I’ve got a message for you, Fingers. Yes, keep away from knobbly little gnomes. Can’t somebody stub him in an ashtray? Listen here, Fingers... Oh, run along, you boring little person. Ooh! (French accent) Oh, Fingers, that was very cruel. He has got feelings. Well, only tiny feelings. (Laughs) Place your bets, please, ladies and gentlemen. All bets down, please. $20 on red 32. You realise, McGee, that if you intend to operate in the Southern Hemisphere it’s me you have to deal with. I’d like to operate on both hemispheres, Fingers. I’m warning you, McGee. It’s my territory. Alright, gentlemen. Can we leave it there and get down to business? Well, gentlemen, now that we have warmed our veins with a little spirited competition, shall we remind ourselves of why we are here? One — a casino, presumably impregnable. Two — a safe containing $2 million, give or take $100,000. Gentlemen... ..what an invitation, hmm? lfwe don’t rise to the challenge and crack it, then no criminal in the Southern Hemisphere will be able to hold his head up again. Nor anything else, for that matter. Oh, really! What are you doing there, you miserable little microbe?! I’ve got a right to be here. I’m still working for you! Not on this job, you’re not. This is big-time, Dwart, and you’re strictly small-time. Fingers, that was very unkind. He has his uses. Yes, possibly sitting in somebody’s front garden on a concrete toadstool. Up! Well, now, where were we? Oh, yes. The plan. At exactly 4:00am the alarms will be cut, and the electronic eye will cease to operate. And the guards? I’ve arranged that they’re... taken care of. Who checked it out? The Hatchet. How come he’s not here now? Well, now...how shall I put this? He, ah, became a little...difficu|t. So? So we had to send him on a long holiday. An extended vacation. Er...the thing that bothers me, Fingers, is how come you wanna cut us in on the action? I need men. What about using one of your own boys? I mean, I know the Hatchet is out... Yeah...what about Loopy Snieder and the Weevils? For that matter, what about Dwart? I know he’s only three feet high, but you used him before. Well, I’ll tell you. I want to get a foot in with the multinationals. That’s why I chose you, McGee. Good thinkin’, Fingers, good thinkin’. There may be a lot of things wrong with America, but it’s still the best place in the world to sell out to. Am I right? It’s a deal! Well, gentlemen, I suggest you check your watches. It is now 9:00pm. We will all assemble in the cabaret room in time for the 2:00am floor show. In the meantime... ..| suggest you...take it easy. (Murmurs softly) # Skippy # Skippy # Skippy the... # Oh, that’s nice. Oh, baby... Shouldn’t we be getting some rest? Don’t you find this restful? Yeah, of course, it’s just that we’ve got a long night ahead of us. Maybe we should get some shut-eye. My eyes are closed. You might find me a bit disappointing. I may not measure up to Mr McGee’s standard. Why not? Well...people are different. They come in different shapes and sizes... I know! That’s what makes life fun. What, the differences? No, the shapes and sizes. What?! It’s my turn. What are you doing here? Well...l just thought it’d be nice. W-what the hell’s going on? Huh? Look, l-l find your, er... ..your behaviour perfectly, er... ..outrageous. Well, I don’t think it’s any worse than what you’re gonna be doing tonight. What do you mean? Well, I mean breaking into someone’s safe in the middle of the night. Well, that’s breaking and entering, isn’t it? Is it? I don’t think you can pull it off like Ballsy could. Yeah, I’m beginning to have my doubts too. Come on...come on, let’s try. No. What? I said no. What if I won’t take no for an answer? Nancy... ..have pity on me! What have I ever done to you? Look, I’m forced at gunpoint to front up as Balls so that you and the others can inherit the Balls McGee empire. Yeah! But do l have to inherit his domestic arrangements as well? (American gangster accent) I mean, you gotta draw the line somewhere, babe. I haven’t got the stomach, let alone the rest of the anatomy, to handle it. (Sobs) What’s wrong? Why am I so different? Well...you’re not different. You were nice to Cindy and Mandy. Oh, Jesus! (Continues sobbing) Oh, don’t, Nancy...don’t. Here we go again. You’ve gotta admit, he must have something. Ah, he doesn’t look any great shakes to me. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Who is it? It’s the house detective. I’d like to speak to Mr McGee. Er...just a minute, I’ll go and get him. You...Harry. Quick! Get dressed. (Coughs) Ah, so you’re Mr McGee? (American gangster accent) Er, that’s right, yeah. Sorry to disturb you at this late hour, Mr McGee, but there are two matters that I’d like to clear up. A gun was reported to have gone off in this suite last night... ..and also one of our guests, a Mr Purple, has unaccountably disappeared. Er, Mr Purple, huh? Well, as I understand it, he was last seen in your company, sir. Er...er... W-w-well, let me set, er, your mind at, er, rest, er, sir. Mr Purple is, er, currently in the bathroom and, er, as for that gunshot that you heard that was, er... ..well, that was a real laugh. Er, that was nothing more than a champagne cork going off. Er, pop! Well, could I see Mr Purple? Er... ..well, I’d go and get him, er, except for the fact that he is, er, engaged in matters of a very, um, er, personal nature. I’ll wait. (Normal voice) Er, what can I do for you? Um...has anyone ever told you that you bear a... ..a strange resemblance to Mr McGee? Er, yeah. Everyone says that. Er, don’t they, Jake? Yeah, boss. I mean, sure, Alvin. Where is Mr McGee? (Calls) Er, Mr McGee?! Maybe I better go in and, er, bring him out. (Gangster voice) Oh, sorry, sir. I’m just taking a bath. A bath? Ballsy’s a very impulsive man, Detective. When he gets an urge to do something, he just does it. Anywhere. Er, you’ll have to excuse Mr McGee. He’s, er, in the bath. With one of the ladies. Oh, he is, eh? What do you want to see him for? Er, well, l-l...| don’t rightly know. l, er...| feel that I would like to see you and Mr McGee in the, er, same room... at the same time. Well, er...just a peek. He’s in a rather, er, intimate situation at the moment, if you, er...understand what I mean? Eh? Shh! Half his luck. What would you say if I asked you into a bath like that? Well, I’d say you’d be stiff, Detective. We’ve gotta get rid of that body! Right. Spike, give him a hand. Make it snappy. We’ve gotta be in the cabaret in 10 minutes.

Shit. What’s happened? The magician’s cabinet. What are you two carrying on about? Nothing that won’t keep, Fingers. Not so sure of that. Pretty much on the nose now. MAGICIAN: Ladies and gentlemen, for this disappearing act I shall need a volunteer from the audience. Whilst I can guarantee your safety, remember, nobody comes out of the disappearing cabinet exactly the same as they went into it. It will be a magical experience that will change your life. Perhaps, er, you, sir, would, er, care to assist us in an exhibition of the mystic arts? Um, no, thank you, no. Oh, surely the great McGee isn’t chickening out. Oh, well, no... it’sjust, er, not my style. I’m sure our American friend will be only too happy to assist you. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to witness is one of the greatest disappearing acts ever performed in public. First performed by the famed Houdini, it has puzzled audiences all over the world for over half a century. The essence of what is about to happen is its simplicity. Our volunteer will enter the empty cabinet, the door will be closed upon him and, from a distance of three paces, I will utter the magic spell that will cause his body to vanish. Don’t worry, sir. Although your body will vanish from inside the cabinet, you will experience no physical discomfort whatever and we will return you as soon as possible. Ladies and gentlemen, as this act requires the utmost in concentration from both myself and our volunteer, I must ask that you all remain absolutely silent. You are ready, sir? Naturally. ( DRUM ROLL) (Audience laughs) (Audience laughs) Abracadabra! Sim sala bim! Ladies and gentlemen, a mystic spell has been uttered and, as you will see, our volunteer has vanished. (CYM BAL CRASHES ) (Audience gasps) Jesus. That’s blown it. Hah...ah... ..ladies and gentlemen, um, the Great Maldini, at this, the moment of his greatest triumph, feels absolutely weak, the very universal energy drained from his veins. As you can see, this man is clinically dead. (Audience mutters) If there were time, the Great Maldini would ask you to come up, all of you, one...a-a-all, and...and feel his pulse ’cause there’s not a drop of vein. But it’s not an experience for the faint of heart. So instead he will put him into the cabinet and with a ‘sim’ and a ‘bim...sala’ close the doors and...completely, without a moment of hesitation or delay, restore him to life before our very eyes. Abracadabra. ( DRUM ROLL ) (CYM BAL CRASHES ) (Audience gasps) (Audience applauds and cheers) And a big hand for the Great Maldini’s magic feat. Ohh! I thought I’d lost you, McGee. Well, gentlemen, shall we be moving on? Hmm? Well, we’ve had the entree, shall we now try the main course? I must slip into my working jewellery. FINGERS: Ohh! Cut yourself shaving? (Mumbles angrily) (MUTED BEEPING) The electronic eye’s still on. I thought it had been taken care of! So did I. Somebody’s goofed. |’|| blast it. What?! Are you out of your mind? Well? What do we do now, McGee? (MUTED BEEPING QUICKENS) (SINISTER MUSIC) (BEEPING STOPS) I’ve got to hand it to you, McGee. First that act upstairs, now this. Tell me, how do you do it? Er, an old pro never gives away any secrets, er, Fingers. 48...Ieft... ..25...right... ..and 21...left... I don’t understand it! It’s just not my day. That’s the combination. Over to you, McGee. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Cop that, you boring big people! Please, Dwart, don’t shoot me. I’ve always liked you very much. You’re only saying that. No, really. Here let me show you. Let me out! Let me out of here! You’ve done it again, McGee. Open this door! Beautifully executed. Come on! Let me out! A classic...doublecross. Let me out! Come on! Let me out of here! Open this door! (SINISTER MUSIC) It’s the bloody Hatchet! Let’s get out of here! Hey? What are we gonna do?! Let’s split up. We’ll go in the car of Balls. Alright. Meet at the airport at 9:00. That was close. If you’d warned me the Hatchet was after us... Loopy warned you. That is crazy. He and the Weevils are going to kill you. What the hell for? Because you made the deal with Fingers. Oh, no. Don’t worry. They won’t find us here. (ROMANTIC MUSIC) SONG: # I won’t ask I don’t need no reason why # Could be a throw of dice or a spaceship in the sky # My poor old head’s so full of you and I need you by my side # I’d almost say tomorrow, “Come on, baby, just let it ride" # Sweet stranger, make me sing and make me smile # Sweet stranger, let me make it all worthwhile # Sweet stranger, knowing there ain’t no end # Come on, baby, let me be your friend # Taking it easy, make it easy # One more time # Ooh-ooh-ooh # Ooh-ooh-ooh # Ooh-ooh-ooh # Ooh-ooh-ooh # Sweet stranger, make me sing and make me smile # Sweet stranger, let me make it all worthwhile # Sweet stranger, knowing there ain’t no end # Come on, let me be your friend # Taking it easy, make it easy # One more time. # What will we, er, do for the next couple of hours? Very simple. (ROMANTIC MUSIC) You know that time at the roulette table? I knew you could not be Balls McGee. Why didn’t you say something? I couldn’t really put my finger on it. And you think you can now? I know I can. And I will.

Last call for passengers on TAA flight 427 to Sydney. This flight is now ready for departure. (JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES) (JAZZ MUSIC CONCLUDES) Does, er, that look better? So that’s the Hatchet, eh? Eugh. Don’t turn around now, but you see those two men with Boobs? We’ve gotta get rid of them both. What about Boobs? Boobs too. They were all at the robbery. (UPBEAT FUNKY MUSIC) Hey, am | imagining it or are we being followed? You’re imagining it. I know it must be pretty dull and ordinary, Alvin, now you’re not a stand-in gangster anymore. I’ll tell you, though — it’s a good deal healthier. (Fires machine-gun) (Laughs) (TYRES SQUEAL) (GUNHRE) Out of the way! Jeez!

(Weakly) Now you see the value of constant practice. Are you comfortable, sir? Oh, yes, thanks. Well, anything you want, just press your Hostess Call button. I’ll be at the back of the plane. Careful, Alvin. I wouldn’t advise it, boy. I’d hate to think what would happen if you came up against Boobs on a dark night. Pistols? Stilettos? Hatchets? I mean, she’d stop at nothing. Now, Spike, don’t be awful. You know how I feel for Alvin. I thought that hostess was pretty attractive. Can’t you restrain yourself just this once for me, Alvin? Alright. I’ll try. What I want now is some peace and quiet for us both. I hope you don’t find that too boring. (Laughs maniacally) (Continues laughing) (MANIC LAUGHTER ECHOES) (UPBEAT MUSIC) SONG: # Hey, Alvin # Though you’re on your way # Wingin’ through the air # It’s a brand-new day # Alvin, come what may # Oh, Alvin # How you’ve been through it all! # Thieves and guns and guys and dolls # Havin’ such a ball # Or are you bound to have a fall? # Why? # Why, why does it have to be you? # | ask you, already # Why? # Why, why does it have to be you? # You tried to avoid it # Did your best not to attend # But they wooed you and they pursued you # And they got you in the end # Why? # Why, why did it have to be you? # Alvin (Girls sing) # Alvin # You’re in love — there’s no doubt # Can you last the distance? # Let it all hang out? # Ha ha — that’s # That’s what it’s all about # Alvin # Alvin # We wish you all the best # Knowing the stock you’re made of # We know you’ll stand the test # But please # Give it a rest (Laughs) # Why # Why, why does it have to be you? # Oh, yeah # Jump back # Why # Why, why does it have to be you? # Why? # Why does it have to be you? # Why couldn’t it have been Big Julie? # Or Harry the Horse? # Or Louie the Lip? # Why does it have to be you? # Hey, Alvin # Why? # Why couldn’t it have been me, already? # Why does it have to be you? #
