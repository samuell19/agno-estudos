Muthu, are you cutting thorns? Yes, brother. Only here will you find thorn-farming done behind a thorn-fence. As long as there's food on the plate, anything is fine. Any letters for me? No, I'd have given you if there were any. You'd applied for a job? You'll need to shell out some money to get a job. Even for this ED postman job... where I have to work under the scorching sun and travel to barren villages like yours... I paid a bribe of 1 lakh! It's okay, Muthu... There is a God up there. He will show you the way. He will look after you from the heavens now. Always remember him, okay? I'll see you. ' THE SCORCHED FOREST ' Hey, girl... What are you saying? My dear son... What happened to you? Oh, Muthu! Dear God... What have you done? Oh, dear. His body is covered with thorns. What did you do? It's bleeding everywhere. You studied all that to end up like this! Don't do this, son. Go somewhere else and find some job. Some job... any job. Don't go back to cutting thorns, son. This land is a fire demon. It will consume you. O Goddess Muthalamman... Pull it out gently. Don't go about it like you were a hen in your previous birth! - Shut up, brother. - Pull out the small thorns with a hook. Let me make a neem oil and turmeric paste, heat it, and apply it on your wounds. You will be fine. If we apply oil and turmeric on you, you'll look like marinated chicken ready for roasting! Yeah, right! Shut up. He set the place on fire and burnt down the entire farm. Thankfully the lands adjacent were barren, so the fire got put out. Or the police would have taken your son away. He didn't do anything wrong. He is dying too under the scorching sun. I lost my investment. Tell him to cough up my money. Sir, please be a little considerate. I didn't set off the fire. You can see for yourself. You can find the trail from where the fire began. I don't need any evidence. It was the beedi you smoked. Cough up my money. Five thousand rupees. If you find even five thousand paise here, feel free to take it. How dare you burn down my farm and talk this way? Listen, I don't give a damn. Don't you forget, I've got a sickle here with me. You won't be alive if you mess with me. I'll cut you up. Are you seriously threatening me? Save the rest of your story for the police. Oh, I see. You will file a case saying I burnt down that bit of your farm, right? I'll burn down all 400 acres of your farm lands. You can file a case for all that put together. What are you saying? Just go. I'll sort you out. He thinks he can threaten me! Buzz off! Why did you say that? Stray mongrels only bite those who fall down. I don't want to get bitten. I can't take it. Have a bath and get dressed. Go on. - Why? - Get moving. You shouldn't be here anymore. You are scared of this loser? I'm not scared of him. I am scared of you. Your horoscope says you are a killer. The astrologer has categorically said you will kill with your own hands. You are fated to become a killer. I'm suffering here only because I didn't want you to end up becoming that. You went to the extent of pulling out the sickle! You shouldn't be here any longer. Be quiet, Ma! Where do you want me to go? First get dressed. If we leave now, he will say we ran away in fear. Let me take care of that. - He won't spare you either. - Just do as I say! Ma, don't forget to lock the door and take the keys. Where do we get off to get to Seelathikulam? Next stop. Brother, where is Sermathurai's house? The guy from Bombay? It's the new house with the decorations done. Sir... Sir? Who is it? Lakshmi. Lakshmi from Naduvakuruchi. He knows me. I came here only to see you. This is my son, and my daughter. Greet him, son. Do you live in Naduvakuruchi now? We have nothing left there now. We lost his father few years ago. We live in a hut in the forest near Karuvakolam. His father worked as a palm climber, and just when it looked like things were getting a little better... we are pretty much on the streets now. We borrowed money for his medical expenses... and the debt has compounded with interest. All three of us work as labourers, but we still can't meet expenses. Please be there for him and show him the way, sir. I have nobody. I have nobody else. I can try to get him a job here somewhere. Take him to Bombay. I run a small restaurant in Bombay. Let him work with you there. He needs to send 4000 rupees home every month. Or the loan sharks will kill me and my daughter. Bombay is not what you think it is! It's a tough life out there. Life here is tougher. Listen to me. I'll get your son a job at a kitchenware store in Eral. Look... Look at his body. What is this? Handiwork of thorns. His body has been ripped apart. Like a tiger mauled him. This soil is that tiger. It will kill my son and consume him. Please save my son. Fine, I'll do something for him. You are a godsend. May you live long. Please eat. I'll get you some water. Eat up, son. Eat to your heart's content. Eat. The food is good here. It's chicken gravy, brother! Just eat. Listen... Go home, pack your clothes, and come here with your bags. There's nothing much there. That's okay. Bring your certificates and your ration card and ID. Okay. Or actually, stay right here. Your mother will get it for you. I'll get it tomorrow morning. Okay. Please stick around with him, okay? - I'll see you, brother. - See you, son. Stay here. Girl, take this. My father gave this. Take it, girl. Listen... I'll give you some money. Go to Radhapuram and pick up a few shirts, trousers, lung is... and a pair of slippers, okay? I've booked tickets to go to Bombay tomorrow You'll have to travel in the unreserved compartment, okay? Here, take it. This is a lot of money. Keep it, son. Go to a ready made clothes store and buy new clothes. Also buy yourself a suitcase, okay? New clothes, huh? Yes. Why didn't you just change into them? No, I'll wear them later. Senthooran, listen to me! I swear on my mother and my children... I didn't do anything wrong. Do you think I would ever betray you? All of you are suspecting me only because I happen to have travelled to my home-town now. I came here for my house-warming ceremony. All of you knew this, Senthooran. I'll explain in person. I am ready to fall at your feet. Please try to understand me, Senthooran. May you live long. Senthooran, please talk to the boss. Please arrange for me to talk to the boss at least once. Please don't harm me. I have a family. Senthooran, I don't know what else to say... Brother? Post this letter tomorrow morning. No matter what happens, post the letter. Okay? Okay. Dear... - Dear... - Dad? - Open the door. - Dad, open the door. - Open the door. - Dad! Dad, open the door! - Son, can you please come here? - I'm sure he is okay. Open the door. Dad! What happened, ma'am? He won't open the door. I've been knocking for a long time. I don't know what's wrong. Brother? Dear... Open the door, Dad! - Dear... - Open the door, Dad. Dad, open the door! What are you doing inside? Open the door. Dad! No! Fetch Ratnam Uncle. - Here? - He lives right here. Oh god... This is a police case. We must inform them. Son... - Son... - Ma! What happened, son? I heard something on the way. We don't know why. Stop, Ma. Oh, no. What do we do now? O Goddess Muthalamman... I was counting on you. But you've deceived me yet again. I am leaving tomorrow. Where to? Bombay. To Sermathurai Uncle's shop. Address? I have the address. How will you manage without him? Let's see. How will you travel that far without knowing the language? I don't have an option. Go on, son. God stands by the lost ones.

What is it, dear? I heard someone say 'police'. Give me your phone. - Hello? - He'll call you back. Hello? - These guys dig into everything! - Why are you creating a din at night? Why are so many people staying here? Is this a parotta shop or a pilgrim house? Do you take us for fools? Yes... I am certain that it was one of you that night at Grant Road. I want to see your faces. I'm sure I can identify who it was. And I'm going to give you a sound beating! What? Nothing, sir. - What are you looking at? - Nothing, sir. How many men live here? Thirty, sir. All of them work here. I need ID proofs for everyone. Of course, sir. I'll give it. Every single person who works here needs to have an ID proof. Stay quiet! - Did you find anything? - Nothing, sir. If we get suspicious, we will come again. Go in, everyone. - Hurry up. - Quiet, they might hear us. They must have got hold of some CCTV footage. Could they have figured out it was a Thoothukudi sickle in the dark? They must have figured out it was a Tamilian from the way in which we butchered him. That's why they are here. Hey, come. - Where are you taking me? - Just come! Let's go for a stroll. Why are you walking so weirdly? I only have two pairs of underwear. I rotate these two pairs. It's still wet, so it's itchy. Like there's a shortage of underwear! Let's get you more. Come, let's go. Let's buy it in this shop. Brother... There are only women here. Here, its always women in sales. India is developing at a rapid pace, and you are feeling shy about this? - Shut up, brother. - What do you want? - What do you want? - Nothing. Tell him I don't want anything. - We are only buying underwear. Not condoms! - Paavai, ask them what they want. Come on, brother! - Stop being shy. - Hello, what do you want? Oh, she is a Tamil girl! We want underwear. - Give him four pairs of underwear. - What's his size? - Size? Hey... - Oh, damn! Muthu, what's your size? Forget about the size. We don't know his size. You can measure him yourself. - Come here. - I've got a tape to measure. No, that's okay. No need for that. Please keep quiet, brother. - That's alright. - Get him some underwear quickly! Okay, let me get you branded underwear. She thinks you are someone worthy of branded underwear. And look at you acting all shy! I should have never come with you! These are the ones. Have a look. Which colour do you want? It has to be red. Red's been in fashion since the good old days. - Is that so? - Where are you from? Fine, I get it. Brother, this is too big for me. Miss, he says it's too big for him. We have an Extra Small size. - No, I'll take four pairs in M size. - Take it! - We will take all four. - Shall I pack it? Should I bill it? I hope you have the money. - Do you want anything else? - Nothing! - This is enough. - Why don't you take a couple of vests? - Keep your mouth shut, brother! - She just smiled at you. You can bill it. Come. You never told me where you are from. Thank you, brother. Here is six thousand rupees. Count it. The new shirts have arrived. Yes, sister. I'll count it. What do you want? Well... The other day... Do you remember me? I don't get it. Small... Extra Small... - And I finally bought 4 pairs in M. - This is Extra Small. This is Extra... no, Medium size. And this is Large. I'll take all of it. Okay. It's been billed. You can collect it from there. - Here is your bill. - No thanks. What happened? I don't have the money. - What did you say? - This guy is a pain! What happened? Take it, I'll offer a discount. You want this? Four. - Okay, sir. - Hey! Come. I'm talking to you! Come. Should I pack it, sir? - Hold on. - Okay. You are going to follow me home anyway. Might as well carry these bags. If you don't like it, I won't come. I don't like it. Don't do that. It's not nice. Hold on a second. I feel bad looking at you carrying all that. Let me carry your bags just this once. Let me come just for today. Okay? Okay, take it. Both bags?

Okay, sure. This looks good, right? How much is this belt? Muthu, pick up a nice belt. - This one? - Just do as we tell you to. Don't act smart. I want a better one. Black doesn't look good on me. Let's go. This is brown. Hey, Malayali! Do you remember me? It's Muthu. We met at the railway station. You are Sridharan, aren't you? Looks like you've settled in. Yes Hope you have settled in, too. Yes, right here. Esakki Parotta Shop. That's where I work. I work in the kitchen. Come there for a meal sometime. Parotta with chicken curry is great there. Do you eat meat? I'll come there some day. Where do you live? Where do you live? Right here. Oh, I see. You should come here some day. For a haircut. - Okay, I will come. - What is he doing there? I do need a haircut. Muthu... We are going to watch a film. - Which film? - A 'Superstar' Rajinikanth film. Dude... Sridharan, don't you have any work to do? Kutty Bhai wants to see you. - I said, come. - What's wrong? I'll see you, Sridharan. What is it? What? Who permitted you to go there? Who permitted you to go there? Whose permission do I need to go to a barber's shop? You'll end up dead. - Arunjunai, not here. - I know the guy. Come. Give him the lowdown. Fine. What is it, brother? What...? Remember Arunjunai was washing off some blood one night? You know whose blood that was? You saw a bald guy at the barber's shop? His name is Sadhanandan. The man Arunjunai killed was his brother, Mukundan. Killed him? Yes. Why? We will never get to know. They pass the orders to kill, and we just do it. Let's go. Who? That too we'll never get to know. Come, let's go. It's getting late. Let's go. This released in 2006, right? Buddy, it released in 2005. 11 years later and fans are still thronging to watch Thalaivar. Make some noise! Louder, louder. Thalaiva! What? You think your Thalaiva is bigger than our Bhai? Out of my way. Bloody Madarasi! Let's go. Who is that? Look at Muthu! He is beating the crap out of them. That's enough. Muthu, let's go. - We should get out of here. - Don't punch him to death! - Let's get out of here. - Come, let's go. Let's go. Don't let him get away. Catch him. Hey, stop! It's got 13 bullets! It will blow your brains out. Want to take me on? Want to die? I'm from Thoothukudi, damn you! Muthu... Muthu! Muthu, wake up! Quick! Wake up. What is it? - Where are they? - What's going on? How dare they sleep after everything they've done! Where is Ma as an am? Over there. You brainless moron. You bloody fool. Why did you pull your gun out? Brother... - Brother... - Don't say a word! I'll rip your mouth apart. You bloody beggars. We feed you and give you a place to sit, but your asses just can't stay put, huh? - How dare you pull out a gun in public and fire in the theatre? - Brother, who is this? You got away because the cop I know called me to enquire. Imagine the consequences if it reached the boss' ears. If you want to die, just go ahead and die! Don't suck the life out of me. You filthy scumbags. Yes, boss? Not a problem, boss. We will get it done. I know where they are. It will be done by dawn. Okay, boss. Okay, boss. Go to sleep. I'll take care of it. Consider it done. We've got some work. - Come. - Okay, brother. You too. Esakki, we couldn't finish the job at night. Both of them are dead. What? - Yes, they got their revenge. - Oh, dear. Turn the TV on. TV? Yeah, V News. What is it, brother? It's being said that these bodies were dumped in the water... and have drifted towards Dadar Chowpatty. Useless guys! I was wondering why they went absconding... but they are dead! They killed our top guys. The police have sealed off the surrounding areas. All these occurrences point in one common direction, that the Mumbai underworld might have something to do with these gruesome murders A police investigation is underway and we will soon receive updates on the same. Until then, stay tuned. Arunjunai and Ma as an am. - They are dead. - Thank you, Pratik. Who could possibly be behind this heinous act at Shivaji Park? The police are investigating the matter... - and will soon arrive at a conclusion. - Make way. Go, get back to work. Muthu, go. Our men are dropping dead one after the other. What's going on! I never thought Ma as an am would die. He could take anyone face on. - He was going to meet his daughter next week. - His life with his family was only over the phone. He might have just had another baby with her over phone! Did he save up any wealth? He was building a house. It's incomplete. Looks like he is in debt. Arunjunai always said that when he manages to save up 5 Lakhs... he'd go home and setup a provisions store. This trunk is all that's left of him. Even his corpse won't be sent home, right? Sharing the news of their deaths to their wives is the hardest part. So many men, and so many tears. Esakki apparently told them. And they cried and lamented over phone. Poor things! Someday, news about our fate will be shared the same way. That is why I never married. Maakali, what about your mother? If you die, she will have to beg for survival. So shut up! Stop complaining! We are resigned to our fate. I hope I live at least till the age of 50. In this line of work, 50 is a pipe dream. That's true though. Go back to sleep. - Wonder who is next. - Brother... What's going on here? A battle. Where it's just killing, back and forth. We are just pawns waiting to die. Think of it like a big machine. We are nothing but tiny screws in the big machine. The screw doesn't know what the machine does. The screws can never know! Out here, land is wealth. Land grabbing and retrieving usurped lands is the biggest criminal activity out here. These days, the big guys don't do anything by themselves. Murders, abductions, chopping off limbs, blackmail... there are people who do this for money. That's us! Whoever gets caught doing it will end up in jail. That is us, too! They can't do anything to the one who gives orders. The money they pay us accounts for the risk of jail time. In the 80's, the south of Tamil Nadu was in a famine. Our men migrated here for survival. And setup parotta shops. And everyone was trying to extort them, demanding protection money. Our men picked up the sword to keep them at bay. And you know who we are, we were raised on scorched earth. We've lived amidst fire. We are used to blood. And eventually, violence became our livelihood. And then some people made it big doing that. Even now, there are 4-5 bosses. He is Karukkuvel. They call him 'Karjee' here. He takes orders and executes it. Senthooran is under him. And Esakki works under Senthooran. All of us are Esakki's men. He is Kutty Krishnan Nair. They call him 'Kutty Bhai'. Just like us, he came here for survival too. He worked as a barber under a Goan guy. And then he became a big shot here. The war is between us and him. They own 'Malabar Saloon'. This one time, he sent his men to kill Karjee. Shoot him, Senthooran! Karjee survived the attack. Your uncle Sermathurai was his right hand man during that time. When the murder attempt happened, your uncle had gone back home. So Karjee assumed that he must have ratted out on him. Everyone was furious that he bit the hand that fed him. I guess he killed himself to prove that he was innocent. Pay attention to what I say now. No matter what, don't you ever touch a gun or weapon. Never ever okay? It is cursed. It's an alluring beast. If you touch it, it won't spare you. Be careful. - We came here to pick up rice bags. - You mean wheat? - That's what I meant! - Don't lie! - You can check with Arunjunai. - No need! - Ma as an am... - Coming, brother. - Open the door. - Brother is here, I'll call you back. Brother is here. You saw what happened to Ma as an am and Arunjunai. Brother, can't anyone get out of this place? Listen... If you don't get involved in anything hardcore... if you are unaware of what goes on here... they might spare you if you escape from here. Otherwise, you can't go anywhere. If you end up killing someone... it's dangerous to leave this place. It's safer for you to remain here until your death. Brother? Let Muthu go with the others tonight. - What, Muthu? - What do you mean "What, Muthu?" Why are you shielding him? He is not here to just to make parottas, is he? Okay, brother. I'll send him along. Take Muthu with you. Come. Where to? Just come. - Where are you taking me? - Go to Ma lad. It's your debut tonight. Debut? What happened yesterday? We'd gone to kick a family out of their house. There were five of them. We got into a small scuffle. How much did you pocket? Twenty large ones. Oh, wow. Not bad! What? What is it? What you need to do is... when this guy comes... chop him. Chop him? - Yes. - No way. You won't? I won't. Isn't that why you are here? This is not the time to test him out. Just stay here and watch. - And be prepared to leave. - There comes the Malayali. Come. Get that Malayali guy. He must see blood! Slaughter him! Maakali, snatch his knife away. Muthu, don't let him get away. - Muthu! - Get him. This is for Arunjunai and Ma as an am. - Die, die! - Butcher him! Muthu, time to go. Come! I said, come! Bloody coward! I told you we shouldn't take him! You think he is a coward? Guy running towards him with a knife in hand. And he just stood there with folded hands. This guy is something else. Hey, Sridharan! What are you doing here? Why are you crying? They will kill me. They will not let me leave from here. What are you saying? They want me to be a woman around here. Who? Kutty Bhai. Kutty Bhai? Hold on a second. Let's get away from here. I will come with you. I don't like it here either. If I remain here, they will kill me too. Or make me kill someone. Let's get out of here. Is it possible? Is it possible to escape from here? Yes. Let's leave by train tonight. Will you come with me? Let's meet at the station tonight. Let's get on the first train and go wherever it takes us. I can't go back to my hometown, that's all. Let's go somewhere else and do anything we can for a living. Let's leave. Let's not be here any longer. What do you say? Go. Just go. No one has ever gotten out of here. But you must get out. They'll question me when they find you missing. I'll handle it. Open the door! Kill them. Who are you? - Maakali, they have surrounded us. - Who are these people? Upstairs! Go, get out of here. Kill this mongrel! He's a dodgy bugger, get him. The Malayalis are here. Chop them into pieces! Jay a pal, Maakali... Come down! This will be your last breath. Hey, behind you! There is no one here. Everyone is upstairs. Take them all out! Sudalai! Palavesam! Come upstairs with our weapons. The Malayalis have broken in. Pachakili! Behind you! ♪ It flies higher, higher, higher Like an unhinged roller coaster ♪ ♪ Looking down from high atop Won't everything seem a tiny little dot? ♪ Muthu... You are the man! ♪ Where does it begin? ♪ ♪ Where does it end? ♪ ♪ The course of a river ♪ Hold on, kid! You thought you could escape from here? Do we look like suckers to you? Bloody scumbag! We found you within 2 hours, didn't we? We have eyes everywhere, you piece of shit! Where were you planning to go? With whom? I'll sort you out later! Come. ...is not answering your call. Please try again later. - Are you going? - Yes, Brother. I will butcher every single one of them. How did the boy get a gun? Was it Maasanam's gun? It belonged to Uncle Sermathurai. I brought it with me. - Brother... - I heard it. He's quite the man! Call me after the job is done. They attacked when we were asleep, or none of them would've gotten away. We should cause them double the damage. - Where? - Over there, second floor. We're done for the night. Let's move. They've surrounded us. There's so many of them! Butcher them all! Don't spare even one of them. Slit his throat! Get him. Watch it! Don't shoot him. - Why? - Don't shoot him. Muthu, hit him. Don't kill him. Please spare him, brother. - He is innocent. - We can't spare him. Muthu, why are you getting in the way? - Step aside. - Trust me on this! Spare him... for me. Let's go. Muthu, this is not right. Get in the car, all of you. - I am going to kill you for this. - Kutty Bhai... Please listen to me. I beg you. You watched him die. You had the gun in hand and yet you didn't shoot. You let them kill my brother. My own blood. - You just stood there watching. - I was helpless. I couldn't do anything, Kutty Bhai. But there is no point in killing you. It shouldn't be you. It has to be him. Karjee. No matter what happens... he has to die. Come. Our boss, Karjee, stays at different 5 star hotels everyday. He decides where he stays, just half an hour in advance. Where does his family live? They could be here. Or Orissa. Or Bihar. They could be anywhere. Check them. Wait here. Got a major kickback the other day when I fired the gun. Who are they? The boss' bodyguards. My hand has been hurting ever since. - Esakki... - I'll clean it today. They've got guns too. What if they kill the boss? Hey! Shut it! Tell him. Keep quiet. Greetings, boss. This is the boy? Yes. The first time you saw a gun in your life... you chose to pick it up and hide it. Not everyone makes that choice. And the guy who does make that choice... will one day pull it out, and fire. That's the gun making him make that choice. The gun chooses the man. Boss, he's been here with us for only six months. This was the first time he fired a gun. Eight on eight! What did you do after you fired? Did you tremble? Or did you drop the gun and burst into tears? He was apparently steady and holding onto it like he owned it. When I got there, he looked relaxed. He was waiting there to take our injured men to the hospital. I got him out of there. You are quite the man. Will you stand by me? We need guys like him. We need somebody who'll be a bodyguard and a servant. Stand by my side, boy. Muthu... Sara van a, please wait outside. Take him. See you, boss. See you, boss. Do you want him? Why? He is Sermathurai's nephew. So what? We didn't kill him, did we? We only suspected him. He hung himself. He brought Sermathurai's gun along with him. So what? Maybe he isn't seeking vengeance. But the gun might have a mind of it's own. It's a monster. Enough with these tall tales! Boss, let me just be frank. I feel this boy might kill you. Because of the question he asked me. "What if the boys with guns shot the boss?" ...he dared to ask me! It's been bothering me. It's like going to sleep with a snake in your bed. Teaches you to be wary. There is a thrill in that, too. Let's see what happens. Senthooran, teach him the tricks of the trade. You stay behind. You are going to be here from now. We've been asked to show you how it works around here. To become a bodyguard. They will train you for the job. You are in luck. Here? You don't like it? It's a 5 star hotel. Muthu... Here on, there is no stepping back. The only path left, is ahead. Your face, hands and legs are stained with blood. You will survive only if you stick around with him. Truth be told, you are not going to be protecting him. He is going to protect you. Understand? Here is your twenty five thousand. Does he work in a big company? That's a lot of money. Do you have a bank account? I am asking because if he is going to be sending more money... he has to send it through a bank. He can't send it through the post office. If someone asks you what you do for a living... "I am a bodyguard for this guy." "I travel with him everywhere like an assistant." "I have to do the tasks he assigns to me." "That's my job, that's all, nothing else." Don't ever say that. Don't think this is a small and easy job. Things can blow up any moment. Get it, Muthu? Okay, boss. They just pretend to check us. But they are our boys. They will ignore your gun. If we had to worship someone like they were God... it has to be the court judges. It takes 30 years for a civil case to be tried at court. People come to us to settle these cases for them. These two guys have swindled eight crores from our man. It's a civil case, and it has come to us. Notice how they let your weapon go? Stay alert. Brother Karjee! Greetings. - How are you? - All good. Please sit. So, how come you are here today? So, Esakki... What have you decided? What is he saying? He is just grinning ear to ear, but he isn't coming to terms. I'll let him keep one-fourth of the money for his business acumen... and ask him to return three-fourth of the money. Be prepared, just in case. Why are you talking in Tamil? Seventy percent. Oh, brother... since you insist, I am willing to meet you halfway. I will give you ten percent. Ten percent? You filthy stinking... who do you think you are talking to? Slit that guy's throat! No discount. That's all you get. No discount! You've lost your chance. You pay back 100 percent! Let's go. This case is child's play. - Save my brother. - Muthu, let's go. This is only a civil case. We get cases like property disputes, inheritance, power of attorneys. - Hi, baby. - Hi! - What is name? - Twinkle. You...! What the hell? Don't scream. It's just me. What do you mean 'it's just me'? Who are you? I'm supposed to come hug you and just sit here with you? I don't even know your name. What are you doing here? You expect me to fall for you because you came to the store a few times? No, but I've fallen for you. My name is Muthu. You will fall for someone every day. Get the hell out of here. Go find someone else. I wanted to find only you. I came here for you. Since that day, when I first saw you... until now... I've not fallen for any other woman. Until now. That's the truth. Paavai, huh? Where are you from? Madras? Why do you ask? Because you've got the audacity of those city bred boys... to approach a girl who is a total stranger and act like you've known her forever. I feel like I've known you forever. You said it yourself. I am not from Madras. I am from Karuvakulam, near Naduvakuruchi. Why are you standing here? My dad and my aunt are together inside. She will call out once they are done. - Then I'll go in. - Oh. You are standing at the edge. I've been standing here for 15 years now. Deep. It's deep... a steep fall from here I meant. I feel like jumping off. Every single day. But I've never done it until now. Thank god for that. So, how old are you? Twenty five. Twenty five? I am only twenty one. Leave. Can I... give you a kiss? Buzz off. Come back after you've come of age. Okay? Okay, can I come tomorrow? Why? Tomorrow's my birthday. Twenty two, huh? No, I turn twenty one tomorrow only. Get lost! You'd just hit me for everything? I'm going. You should go too. - You are going? - Go, go. - What? - Go! Wait! You don't act like a village boy! You are gutsy enough to grab a girl by her hand. You stood here and spoke to me all this while. That gave me confidence. If you didn't like it, you'd have left or created a ruckus. I don't need to be city bred to know that. What do you want? Give me a kiss before you go. Earlier you asked me if you could kiss me. And now you are asking me to kiss you. Go on.

They won't come to our place, it seems. Why not? We've paid them, right? They said this after we paid them the money. How much did they ask? They wanted 10 Lakhs. I closed the deal at 5 Lakhs. Did you see the actress? No, I met this other woman who works for her. - What do we do now? - Listen to me. We shouldn't go to their place. It's risky. But we've given the money, right? What are you saying? Let them keep the money for now. We will meet them some other day at a location of our choice. Not today. I want it today. Let's go. She is an actress. They will be more careful than us to maintain discretion. What does she know about us? They don't know anything about hit-lists, accused, Karjee, Kutty Bhai etc. All they know is that this is some good looking wealthy gentleman. That's how we managed to go all the way and pay the money. They won't tell anyone. It's very safe. Find out the address. Let's go tonight, okay? You've already made up your mind! Get in. He is so desperate! She is not that actress, Muthu. Yes, this isn't her. Sir, only you can come in. The others can stay here. No, I want to come. I'll escort him till the room, and wait outside. Come in. Madam is upstairs. Muthu, go in quickly. Sit inside. Madam is in that room. What is it, Muthu? Everything is okay, right? What are you staring at? Tell her to come quickly! Beat the pulp out of him. Karjee is in the room. Kill him! Break it down! They've tricked me! Break open the door. Don't spare anyone. Muthu... Muthu! Come here, Muthu. What happened, Muthu? Come. Was it the Malayalis? Let's kill them all before dawn. Hello? Everyone is outside. They will go in to eat now. Stay put until then. When should I come? I'm right here. Hold on for five minutes. I'll let you know! It's the front door, okay? We walk into Kutty Bhai's house and we kill him. When we come out of there it should be the five of us. Yes! Let's go. We managed to get all the bodies out of there. Who is that? What was that? Someone broke into the house! - Let's go in. - Fetch all our boys. Arul... They dared to enter my house. Don't spare anybody. Take Bhai inside the bathroom and lock the door! You scumbag! Muthu, they've surrounded us. Be careful. Close the door. Shoot at them. Get me another gun. No, no, no. Don't shoot. I dare you to come in. Maakali, get me that gun. Muthu, it's the police and more of their men. Let's get out of here. Our men have arrived, Kutty Bhai. Muthu, let's go. - Let's get out of here. - Come in, I dare you. Damn! Muthu... I asked for the gun! Let's do it later. Damn! Muthu! Sridharan! Sridharan... Come fast. I am so stressed out. I have a meeting with the boss. There is a women there. You haven't met her, have you? She is a demon. I have to fall at her feet too. I need to get relieved of some tension. Come here. Come here and put your skills to use. Let's leave quickly. They will strip off everything from us here. Turn in your weapons. Greetings, Durga Ma'am. Kutty Bhai... Brother... The top boss knows that the two of you tried to kill each other. That's why I sent for you. I didn't start the fight. I didn't do anything. I have no reason to kill him. No reason? Eight times! And the Malayalis who died two days ago. They were your men, right? How did they die? I killed them. I went to meet an actress and have a chat with her. Your men surrounded me and tried to kill me, right? I would have died... if not for my boy, Muthu. I used him to break into your house and kill all your men. The fighting ends today. Both of you, get out. I am going to get on video call now. Rauf Bhai will talk to you. He might abuse both your mothers. Be warned. Are you doing okay? You? There's no life more despicable than mine. I have to be whoever he wants me to be. I don't have a choice. You haven't killed anyone, have you? My hands are stained with blood. I've killed and I don't even know who they are. I can never kill anyone. I'd rather die. Everyone is waiting to die. What's all this? Who is trying to kill whom? What for? I don't know. We will never know. Attack, protect, usurp... Kill, and die. That's all I know. Have you made some money at least? I got both my sisters married. I've saved up some money too. That's the only silver lining. We should escape from here. Come what may. I am going to stay here. And see how far this goes... and where it takes me. I don't intend to get out anymore. If you die, he is done for. If he dies, you are a dead man. Is he the big boss? He is the boss for now. And if someone kills him, they become the boss. Nothing will change for us though. Fair enough. So it's a truce now? Whatever it is, we are only going to be drinking blood. Let's go. Brother, you've made a promise to the top boss. Neither of you should create any unnecessary problems anymore. If he dies, you should die with him. And if you die, he should die with you. That's the order. To put it simply... it is your responsibility to make sure no one else kills him. We have to make sure no one kills Kutty Bhai. Who is going to kill him other than me? If I have to save him from myself... the only person I can send to protect him is you. Are you ready to go, Muthu? Like he is waiting to take me in! We can sleep peacefully now. Don't you agree, Muthu? They aren't going to ever stop. That's Muthu for you! His vengeance will be more discreet now. And that's why it's more dangerous. Iyer, we had a Skype call at Durga Ma'am's house. The boss came on the line. - And gave us both an earful. - Food? - Get the chicken too. - I was seated across Karjee. - Please take this yourself. - "I killed your men." - I don't want to come out. Please. - "I broke into your house and attacked." He said that in front of Durga. That cunning... We should have killed him at the actress' house. We missed our chance. Now the boss' orders are, either of us dies, both of us die. Where is she? Ask her to come. If she refuses, drag her down here. She doesn't need to listen to what we are talking about. How does it matter? He is right. Tell us what you had in mind. Karjee needs to be killed. It has to be done at any cost. If we spare him now... I will lose all my respect. You said you have orders from the top boss. Yes. So we can't use our men to do the job. Yes. You say you don't want to be linked to this either. We need to use an outsider. An expert. That is why I sent for you, lawyer. Give me some idea. I want to kill him to avenge my brother's death. - There is this contract killer. - Who? His name is Rawther. I think he is the right person for this job. Is he a Muslim? He is not a Muslim. They just call him Rawther. They also call him Ghost. The CBI and other intelligence agencies are looking for him. - How much will it cost? - One crore. Fine, I'll pay one crore. Call Rawther. Want a haircut? Please sit. Ganesh Iyer. You are? Rawther. Who is it? Are you Ganesh Iyer? Yes, that's me. Who are you? Rawther. Rawther? He says he is Rawther. Hi. This is Rawther? Yes, let's see. Sit. Not here. I like the swivel chair. Venu, close the door. Okay. I'll tell you everything about who the guy is and why it needs to be done. But he is no ordinary man. He is well guarded. It's not that hard. I can kill him myself. Shut up! Rawther! What's this? What have you done! Kill him! Kill him. What have you done! Hello? Who is it? I was right. It's always good to have so many mirrors like this. No one can hide their eyes. I knew it the moment I saw his eyes. - This guy? - Yes, him! I saw him make a call. He's been working for me for the last 13 years. Who knows what aspirations or troubles he had. Was he the one leaking the information? Think about it. Otherwise Karjee wouldn't have survived all your eight attempts to kill him. How do you know we made eight attempts to kill him? Dispose the body, sir. I do a clean job. Did you notice, I didn't even spill a drop of blood. Let's go in and talk now? The thing is... if the top boss finds out I am involved in this... he will wipe me out, with my family. Yeah, so we will kill him... but the blame will not fall on anyone from our gang. For example... Let's use this guy to finish this job. This guy? They sent him to kill me. Madam, what do you want? Two parottas. Attend to this table. One mutton biriyani with one Ma call an scotch. Thank you. Boy... There is talk doing the rounds that you are going to kill me. Do you know about that? So you do intend to kill me? No. What if Kutty Bhai gives you 50 Lakhs? How about one crore? What if the order comes from the top boss? For power? What if they say you will be the next boss after me? Will you kill me then? Answer me. I don't know. You don't know? Five years ago, I never imagined I'd be here doing the things I am doing now. So it is a possibility that you'll kill me, huh? Give me your gun. Pull out your gun. Boss... Pull out your gun. If I wanted to kill you, I'd have done it long ago. Pull out your gun! Aim for the heart. Muthu... Even if you are remotely considering the possibility of shooting me... shoot me now. You can't shoot me. Because I'm like a father to you. I've given you a life. You saved my life once. You won't shoot me now. I say that to pacify myself. What can I do? I trust my instinct. I trusted you... and brought you in. But your hand is rock steady. That's what makes me wonder... Come on, boss. I might just shoot you! Take a walk, boy. See if she is here. Muthu, I've checked her. I'll be back. Hey! Paavai, what are you doing here? Nothing. My boss is inside. He kept propositioning me. He said if I don't come, he will throw me out of the job. He threatened to brand me a thief and make sure that I can't get another job. So? I don't have a choice. If I don't earn a living, my father will just sell me. And I'll have to probably walk the streets. This is the better choice. Better choice? You'd go and sleep with him? What about me? Who are you? Who are you to me? It was just one kiss. Ten days back. You just disappeared after that. I wanted to talk to you about this. So I came to your parotta shop. You weren't there. So I decided to come here. Which room is he in? - This room? Knock on the door. - No, don't do anything. Knock, I'll manage. You go ahead... I said knock on his door! Is it this room? No, don't! - Let me ring the bell. - Do it. ♪ There is temptation and fragrance ♪ Paavai, you're here! - Who are you? - Muthu, don't do it! - Muthu, please don't... - Why are you hitting me? - How dare you hit me! - Please, sir... Muthu, don't! Say Paavai is your daughter. Paavai is your daughter! Say it! - Paavai is my daughter! - Muthu, please. I can't hear you. The girls working at your store, they are all your daughters! I'll wring your neck. Muthu, that's enough. Please! - Please, Muthu. Let's get out of here. - Forgive me. - Muthu, please. He might die. - She's my daughter! Please forgive me. For God's sake, don't hit me. - Why are you late? - Dad... Were you hanging around with some guy? I came with my friend. - I brought her home. - Who the hell are you? Can I come in? - Why? Who are you? - Who is it? What happened? I'm talking to you, man! Who is he? What do you want? I'm talking to you, and you're just making yourself at home? - Sit. - Who are you? What do you want? I want your daughter. My daughter? What? I want to marry her the traditional way. I need your consent for that. Making a marriage proposal at this hour? Get up! Your daughter will be safe and happy with me. I will give you 10 years worth of her salary. This is the advance. You shouldn't send her to work at the clothes store anymore. Get her married to me. As you wish, son-in-law. Fix the wedding date. Okay, son-in-law. I'll do it. Can I get a cup of tea? - Make some tea. Hurry up. - Just two minutes. He seems like a really nice boy. Come. I know you'd want to talk about it anyway! Dad, two minutes. I want to talk to him. Sure, go ahead and talk. Well done. That was brave. Getting their consent is the right thing to do. I get that. But asking them to fix a date for the wedding? Don't you need to ask me? We kissed... once. You saved me from my boss, and brought me here. Fine, thank you. But is that enough? Who are you? What do you do? That's a lot of money you've agreed to give them. How do you have so much money? You work at a parotta shop, don't you? You asked me what I was doing at the hotel. I can ask you too, right? What were you doing at the hotel? You had no business being there too. I can't marry you just because you are giving my father a lot of money. You are right. It was wrong. You like me, don't you? Let's talk tomorrow. I'll explain everything. Only if you like me... Only if you feel I am right for you... say yes. Hmm... I always wanted to get married by the age of 22. Probably why I jumped and asked the question inside. Fine, have your tea and get going. And let me say this again. Thanks. For showing me the way. You are thanking me after giving me an earful? Son-in-law? Son-in-law, come in. Tea is ready. - Okay. - Paavai, come in. I always carry this with me. It gives me courage. No one can humiliate me as long as I've got this with me. That's my worst fear. I don't fear death. I don't fear poverty either. I can't stand getting humiliated by anyone. This world treats poor people like doormats and stomps on them. But as long as I've got this... You live by the weapon, you die by the weapon, that's the rule here. I'm fine with that. But I want to live with pride until I die. That's all. If it were some other guy from my home-town, he'd have run scared. A courageous man would have sold the gun and setup a paan shop. But I picked it up and hid it. And brought it with me. But in retrospect, it wasn't a bad decision. My sister and mother are finally doing well. I send them money. My mother is finally eating three meals a day. I will build a house for her. I am also sending money to Sermathurai Uncle's family. I will take care of his daughter's wedding to repay my debt to him. Have you killed anyone? What will you do if I say 'yes'? Will you just leave? You will leave me? Isn't that what you are thinking about? I don't know if I can leave. That was what I was thinking about. It was me who came after you. It was me who asked for your hand in marriage. But let me say this now... you don't have to be with me because you don't have any other option. I'll give you 10 Lakhs within a month. You can take it and leave with anyone. And live happily. What's the money for? Because I like you. If you marry me and live your life with me... you will share my virtues and sins. So... let's not do this. You should leave. I will go away, too. You asked me if I've killed... Don't... Let me reap it all. From your sins. I'm not doing this because I don't have another option.

It's the boss. I've got a message saying it's some urgent work. Can't you go in the morning? He knows, right? I'm wondering, too. Let me check. I'll go. Be back soon. I think it is something urgent. He wouldn't call me otherwise. What? Is it some murder? I'll be back. Lock the door. Why are you here? Isn't it your wedding night? Or have you done it already? I got a message from Karjee. So I came here to check. You got the message late. The rest of us got it three hours ago. Oh, I see. We got information that they've hired someone to kill him. We discussed and decided he shouldn't be here for the next few days. So he left for Pune. Pune? Don't worry about it. Go back to your thing, okay? Did you leave midway? Paavai? Paavai! Paavai? Paavai! Paavai? Muthu, about 10 minutes ago some men took your wife away in a car. What? Which car was it? A Grey Innova. - Which way did they go? - This way. Did they forcefully take her? No, but they were in a bit of a hurry. There were two men. She talked to them for some time and left in the car with them. Hello? - Muthu? Can you hear me? - Brother... Brother, Paavai is missing. They said someone came and took her. Is that so? Do you know who it was? You are such a naive boy. It's an age old tradition for the boss to snatch away the wives of his men. She will be back in the morning. Brother! I'll kill all of you! Where is she? She is in the hotel room. I couldn't tell you anything because Senthooran was next to me all this time. Forgive me. Damn! What is it, Muthu? Why have you come at this hour? - What are you doing here? - Paavai... Paavai? Listen... You are a newlywed. What are you doing here? No, it's Paavai... What's wrong with Paavai? I'm talking to you. Answer me, Muthu. She got married to you just today. Isn't she with you? Why are you looking for her here on your wedding night? But Sara van an told me... What did he tell you? Hey... Listen to me. Sara van an and Senthooran just left. Paavai... - Muthu! - Paavai... - Paavai? - Don't touch me! - What happened? - Muthu... How did she get here? - Paavai, what happened? - I am not okay, Muthu. - Ponraj! Ismail... - How did you get here? What happened? - This is the only safe place. - None of our men are outside. Tell me. They said you sent for me and brought me here. They gave me something to drink. I don't know what happened. - They are plotting against me! - Calm down, Paavai... Muthu... - What did you do to her? - Muthu, wait! - What did you do? - Listen to me! Did you touch her? - How can you say such a thing? - Did you? - Paavai is like a daughter to me. - You'd touch your daughter, won't you? No, Muthu. You've got it all wrong. Are you human or an animal? You've got it mixed up! You think I'd look at Paavai the way I look at other girls? - I was loyal to you. - Don't do anything. - At least for that... - Don't do anything! - I saved your life. - Listen to me! - At least for that... - I am very grateful for that. That is why, I swear on God... I swear on you, Muthu... - Trust me. - I considered you a father figure. I swear on my deity... - You scumbag. - Don't point your gun at me, Muthu. Please think it through. Someone is plotting against us, Muthu. Be wary, Muthu. - I had no idea she was here. - Then how did she get here? Answer me! Muthu... This guy... Don't shoot me. Boss? - Stop! - You bloody traitor! - You killed Karjee, didn't you? - It wasn't me. Get him. Shoot him! Don't let him get away. Shoot him down! Strike his heart. Bhai, why don't you go to your room and relax for a while? All of us should be here. Mona, where are you going? It's 2 am. I'm going up to sleep. I have to leave at 6 in the morning. Go. Okay. Sapna... you are sleepy as well? You go to the kitchen and make me some strong tea. Strong tea! - Okay. - Go. Go on. Go. Go... Hello. Hello! Hello... He hung up! Don't be worried. Hello? Hello, Rawther? I hear you. Tell me. That's great news. Muthu? Oh, no. Finish him off. I'll pay you extra. Finish him off. What happened, Iyer? Karjee is dead. Muthu is not dead yet. But he will be. Karjee is dead? For real? Why do you say it like this, then? - What do you expect? - Show some happiness. Karjee is dead. Say it happily! Iyer, it's taken 15 years. Fifteen years! And today, it's all finally over. He is no more. It's just me now. Iyer, you should be elated! Karjee is dead! We just got the call. Kutty Bhai, temper your excitement. They will retaliate. Tell the boys to be on alert. Don't celebrate just yet. We can't be here anymore. We should leave. Let's leave tonight. All of you heard Iyer, right? We need to be very careful now. We need 10-15 more guards for our protection. We need to leave in 5-6 hours. Sridharan... Karjee is dead! It's our time now. Come, I've got a job for you. Actually, you can go. Buzz off. Sapna... Sapna! Sapna... I am so happy today. So so happy! What do you want? What do you want? Queen of my dreams! I'm going to make you a queen. - Ask for anything you want. - I don't want anything. Please, let go of me. No matter how hard you resist, it's happening today. Ask me for anything you want. Ask me. Won't you listen to me? I am going to call my sister. Sister... Let go of me. I beg you, please let go of me. Let go of me... What have you done? Nobody heard anything. Everyone is outside. Do something. What if they come? Do something. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright, Kutty Bhai. Careful. Wait here. Muthu... Water! Water! Give me water. Sir, take your change. Here, drink this. Drink it slowly. Slowly. Careful... It's nothing. Let's go home, Paavai. Let's go home. Muthu, don't. They're our men. Please don't go, Muthu. Don't do anything. It's just me. - It's just us. - I'll handle it, don't panic. I'm glad I saw you... Hope she is okay. What have you done, Muthu? You should have called him out to his face and walked away. Why did you kill him? What made you kill him? After everything he did for you! You've killed Senthooran and all his men too. No point talking to you now... The news has spread all over, reached Durga madam's ears too. That is how we heard about it. You shouldn't be here anymore. Don't be in this city. Take her and go away some place. Esakki and Maakaliappan are looking for you. The police and authorities will come for you. They won't spare you. They will kill you. You should have thought, at least for her sake! So it was you? It was you, right? Yes. It was me. I need to survive, too. How long can I be stuck down here in this hell hole? That's why. You were Kutty Bhai's guy all along, right? Ma as an am and Arunjunai died because of you, right? They broke into the parotta shop because of you, right? You knew they were coming, didn't you? Out here, it's all fair. Shoot me if you want to. Shoot. Kill him! - His time is up. - Sara van an... - Kill him. - No, brother. Muthu is our hope. Muthu, we trusted him. We should've never left the boss alone at the hotel. You coward! - We made a mistake trusting him. - Forgive me, Muthu. I've been toiling for them for twenty five years! I couldn't find a place for myself. I couldn't even save 10,000 rupees. Look at my wallet... Shoot me. Go on. I should have died a long time ago. I am living on borrowed time. It was Kutty Bhai, right? Who did he use? Who was that guy in Karjee's room? I don't know. It was Kutty Bhai's orders. Only Kutty Bhai's men spoke to me. That's all I know. Bloody hell. Shoot me! What are you waiting for? Shoot me. Don't do it, Muthu. Please don't. Don't think I am sparing you because of her. You won't die at my hands. But one day, you will die. Think of me then, okay? Brother, we need to have a chat. We are kin. - There's no room for that now, brother. - Ponraj, please... - Please don't hurt me. - Betrayal never lasts, Sara van an. No, don't do it. What are you waiting for? Kill him! We must put an end to Muthu. If you can't find him, find the train his mother and sister are on. If we nab them, he will come to us. Is it true? Yes. He killed him. Was it Muthu? Yes, it was that traitor. With Karjee and Senthooran gone, you are next in line. Congratulations. We kill Muthu first. And then we'll talk about that. - Call Sara van an. - I am trying. - He is not answering. - What did he say? He said he's just seen Muthu near M.R. Theatre. He'll talk him into coming and if not he'll finish him off. Like hell Sara van an will kill Muthu! Something is wrong. Did he say near M.R. Theatre? Let's drive to Muthu's house. I can manage. Paavai, please forgive me. I shouldn't have left you alone. Let's get out of here. We shouldn't be here for long. They will come for me. Muthu... Muthu... I'll be right back, Paavai. - I've packed our belongings. - Muthu, we don't need that any of this. Don't touch that gun. Let's live with dignity. Not with these people. Let's run away somewhere and lead a life without them. We don't have to get humiliated by anyone. We can lead such a life. I'll make sure no one uses you like a doormat. Listen to me. I will take care of it. Wait here for a moment. Muthu! - Paavai? - Muthu... Paavai! Muthu! Paavai! Hey! Paavai? Who was it? Are you okay? What happened? Didn't you hear your wife crying? Muthu the brave heart... Take her advice, leave everything behind and skip town. You don't need guns anymore. And one finger less now. Let it be just that one finger. Find some other job and get out of here. Okay? Or death awaits you! Muthu! Muthu... Muthu! You are okay, right? Don't... Muthu, don't do it. Muthu... What? Come at me. Oh, yeah? Want to die, huh? Muthu! Muthu, don't! Are you alright? It's nothing. Take this. I've got more money too. Keep it. Please do something. ♪ Where does it begin? ♪ ♪ Where does it end? ♪ ♪ Where does it begin? ♪ ♪ Where does it begin? ♪ ♪ Where does it end? ♪ ♪ Where does it end? ♪ ♪ The river's course... ♪ ♪ The river's course... ♪ The spot where those bodyguards hang out all the time? Did you look at that spot near his house where the bodyguards hang out? Go and look there! What? I couldn't get through. Your daughter will answer your call eventually. I am going to wait here until then. Don't worry, you don't need to cook for us. We will get parottas from our shop. When she answers, tell her to come here immediately. Tell her that if she doesn't come, we will kill all of you. Yes? What? Really? Muthu, you are a filthy mongrel. Karjee uplifted you, celebrated you, and gave you a good life. Even if he decided to make your wife his mistress for life... you should have stayed by his feet and been loyal to him. You ungrateful scum! My 'Patti' will do that. 'Patti' means dog. I had a Malayali friend in college. He always said this. I was reminded of that when you said it. Get him! Chop him. You moron! Butcher him. Come. Come at me. Keep coming at me. You will get beaten up, and your faces ripped apart. I can take you on. Worst case, I will die. I am ready for that too. But I can't live in fear like you and be a slave for life. I will never bow my head down to anyone. Brother, you think you are next in line after Karjee? Do you want to see how many of these guys will heed my call and join me? Should I show you who the next leader is? But I don't want this. There will always be someone above us. I can't be subservient to him. Nothing else. I didn't kill Karjee. He didn't touch my wife either. If he had even gone near her and smelt her, I would have killed him. But he didn't even know she was there. He was killed by Kutty Bhai. He was killed by Senthooran. He was killed by the snake you fed all these years. I mean Sara van an. He is gone, too. Make way. I am not dependent on this anymore. Go and find good jobs. And stand up against anyone who gets in the way. They can't do squat! ♪ Where does it begin? ♪ ♪ Where does it end? ♪ ♪ The river's course... ♪ Just for them to call us for a negotiation, we had to kill so many. They are terrified! We'll negotiate. I'm hurt too. I've lost an angel. The leader of Four Finger gang is allegedly a Tamilian. Muthu, the leader of the gang, hails from Tuticorin. Our Muthu? It's been six years since I jumped onto the train and left my village. Since then, I haven't gone back once. Muthu, do you plan to go back? Whenever I think about running away... I get thrown in twice deeper. - Let me go! - Sameer Bhai, Gupta, Suraana, Kamlesh... All four of them are going to be there. The meeting is under Durga's control. No guns, no weapons allowed. There will be no problems. Sameer Bhai and Kamlesh will be a problem. And Durga cannot be trusted. I feel the minute you step in there, they'll make an attempt to kill you. I'm going, that's for sure. Inform Sameer Bhai 5 minutes before I reach there... that I have his daughter with me... that she is my insurance... and that I am not in the mood to die today. Got it, Iyer Sir? Why would you go when you know it's dangerous? No. I must go. Some scores are best settled face to face. It's them. I'll be home by 9. We'll eat dinner together. Do you even understand this business? There are rules, you know? We don't bring family into this to settle scores. Look! Your daughter is 25. She has seen many Diwalis. Not seeing any more won't make a difference. My son was three. He hadn't even started calling me 'Dad'. So these rules were written after you killed him is it? I had nothing to do with your son's death. That was me. I killed your family. Every rupee you've made over the last 5 years in Lucknow is mine. Place it at my feet. You handle the small buildings and properties in your area. Leave the big malls, factories, businessmen, and land grabbing to us. Come under my control. Who knows, Muthu... maybe one day I will have a change of heart... and I might even apologise for what I did to your family. I don't need you to apologise, Rauf Bhai. I just want you to die. What did you say? You go to hell. Rauf Bhai, he's kidnapped my daughter. What are we doing here, brother? Wash basin? Can I have some water? - Get some water. - I'll get it. What do you want? No, it's okay. I don't want anything. Who was that? I really don't know.
