I can't cover for you this time, Frank. Your duties stop far short of determining. United States foreign policy. And don't give me that look. You know it's not as simple as the newspapers make it seem. I just couldn't stand there watching these people die. Frank, you're an Air Force major. Those decisions are in the realm of politics. You're in big trouble. Of course there, is a small possibility for some leniency. Sit. It seems you've caught the attention of the president's campaign manager. Excuse me? They suggested a new assignment... Carrying his hands-on control of the nuclear arsenal. What? You mean... you mean that guy who follows him around with... The black bag. It's the only way the president can order a nuclear counterattack. You mean the guy has to go with him wherever the hell he goes? The military aid has the duty and the honor to travel with the president. Well, it would make you unavailable for a court martial. But... And these men and women had their lives taken away to provide us with our every privilege. This is the day that we seek to remember them, to remember those who died to maintain our every freedom, who selflessly fought so that others from other lands may enjoy the same basic rights as you and I. That is why this has to be bigger than just today. I ask you to remember that today. Space command. Opening the case. Let us remember these brave warriors on Veterans Day. And for all the tomorrows that they have given to us as well. As I promised, some questions. Yeah, Fred. Thank you, sir. Mr. President, you've suffered a great deal of criticism on your military restructuring plan, centered mostly on the number of jobs it's going to cost. Checking daily launch codes. The money saved in personnel will go towards developing those weapons that were so successful in Desert Storm. I think a comparison of the casualties on both sides illustrates my point. New codes operational. I confirm. Codes are authentic. Ethel. Do you think you're getting away with far more with your plan than you normally would because of your military record in Desert. Storm? Absolutely. Closing the case. Sir, aren't you concerned that a matter of this importance might be better after the coming war? Well, now that you mention it... Checking self destruct. I'm confident that everyone here knows that I'm not that much of a politician. I do believe that restructuring is very important for America at this juncture in our history. We do have the technology to save lives. Now, if that costs me an election, then I'll just have to take consolation in knowing that I was the president who preferred sacrificing jobs, even my own if necessary, to sacrificing so many lives. Thank you. Right now, the president will shake hands with veterans from World War II... First day jitters? Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War. Any last minute questions? American soldiers here together... If I drop this, is Moscow going to catch a nuke? Of course, the president's then General Douglas... Sir. Served a key role in the success of Desert Storm as Army Chief of Staff. And tonight... Major. Restructuring the military. And though he still leads in recent election polls... It isn't self-defense anymore, Major. It's self-destruct. Now I'm jittery. Cross. Thank you. They didn't mention that one in the manual. Let's go, Cross. Mr. President, may I present Major Frank Cross. Well, I recon I saved your ass, Major. It's an honor to... Mr. Cross. Excuse me, Major Cross. Hi. Be out of jail, sir. It's good for the campaign. Someone forgot about national security. Heatwave has arrived. Still say she's dangerous. We're right on time. Shouldn't they search her? If she's got anything that can hurt me... I'll take your place? We're not supposed to leave his side. A little change in protocol tonight, Frank. Nice tie. My mother gave it to me. Having fun? Military aid's dinner coming up. Hold it. - No, no. It's OK. They checked him downstairs. Through there. Spoil guy. Yeah. Coffee? Yeah. Hey, this is decaf? That's not decaf. Sure, it is. Taste it. I don't drink coffee. This stuff is not going to keep me awake. Better get me something with a little punch. So what did he say when you met him? Who? The president. You know I can't talk about that, Jane. Security breach. He said, don't scratch my luggage. Come on, Frank. Just try and make the best of it? Let me talk to Billy. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye this morning. I called him. He must be sleeping. - Come on, Jane. Where is he? He's not here. What do you mean he's not there? I just think he's a little upset that with the traveling stuff, he'll see you less here in Washington than he did on the base. You know, and when I tried to talk to him, he just gave me the usual, I'm not his mother, stuff. No matter what I say, he does whatever the hell he wants. Yeah. And I wonder wherever the hell he got that from. Look, I'm pretty sure he's over at Danny's house. Just call me the minute you find him, will you? OK. Who loves you, baby? You do. Hey, Maxwell, can you put out an APB on my coffee? Is it a national emergency, Major? Maxwell, I got a missing agent in corridor 10. What's wrong now, Cross? You need company? I'm just making sure you're not taking a break without me. You don't want to be with me on this break. What? You had to take Clark with you? Somebody's got to do the paperwork. Shut up, Maxwell. Room service. You wanted a little more punch. Maxwell, this is Cross. Alert 1. Alert 1. Change the codes. Change... Damn. Blast! Just open the cuff. Shoot! You've got to be good and well kidding me. That's my house! Move off it! First freaking day. Think you're going to rob me? I will kill your ass! Dead! Well, I'll be dipped in sh... I'm sorry! Well, you better clean yourself up. I'll take care of this. Wait. If we start shooting, he will have way too many bodies to hide. Trust me. Let him come to us. The black bag man is still on the move. Make sure he follows us. Did you change the codes? We're working on it. A lot of problems up here. Whatever happens, don't lose them. Let him follow! What? Trust him. Pardon me, miss. Hey. Hey! National security. What's going on? Hey, we're taking him somewhere where we can work, OK? I got them. How are you following? I grabbed a cab. What the hell are you doing? The big plan is to keep him with us. Man. Sorry. Habit. Whoa, look out! Out of the way! Can somebody bring me my gun? Follow that damn car. Let's go. Where are you? Shoot! Where are we? We're on a roof. My head! Anyone mind if I drive? My god. We're not going through this thing again. Get this thing... watch where you're going. Davey, no! You think anybody will recognize him? Not this time. He's toast. We're out of here. Damn. You guys got a lot to do? Are you hearing this? Just tell me that you changed the codes. Where are you? Well, where the hell are you? Cross, our first priority here is the president. I'm three or four buildings northeast of the parking ramp, on the roof. They're in the chopper headed north. We're going to come pick you up on the roof. Don't move. Did you demo the body? Everything still a go at the hotel? For some reason, no matter how many times Cross called, nobody changed the codes. Cross. Dad, you wanted me to call? I guess I must have if you're calling, Son. Well, no big emergency. But I guess now, whenever I feel like going for a walk, she's going to call the cops. She's nuts. Is that any way talk to talk about your mom? My mother's in New York. Yeah, right. Is that any way to talk about your... My... - Chick. Yeah. That any way to talk about her? No. I guess not. Look, I've got to get back to things here. You should probably run upstairs and do your homework. It's downstairs now that your chick moved in. Yeah, right. That's OK. You haven't spent a lot of time here. You probably don't remember. If you made the most of our time together instead of wasting it on complaining, it would feel a lot more like enough. Now put my chick on, Bucko. You still mad at me? That all depends. On what? On what you're wearing. Frank. I'm all by myself up here. Have you ever told me the nastiest thing you've ever done? - Frank. God. - Come on. Most of you have already been reassigned. Another facility, another duty. Time for change. With change comes time for reflection. When we built these weapons of mass destruction, a lot of people had great reservations. They said, if we built them, we'd have to use them. But it's been over 50 years since we've had to resort to that. These missiles have lived up to their name. Rather than use them, we've kept the peace with them. We've tapped into the very power that holds the universe together. And we've used it as a strong... encouragement for the rest of the world to do the right thing. There's been no World War III for one reason... Us. It's just like the silo tour. Not exactly. There are no souvenir Mugs or t-shirts in this one. There will be. Shouldn't you get started with that? If I open this case before we get inside that room, space command will be alert and shut us down. Be patient. Time lock will open in 14 minutes. Maybe not. You've already forgotten what you're doing here? I can't say I haven't been a little confused... Up until now. Yeah? DECKER: Hey, Lopez. It's Decker. I snagged you guys the last bottle of champagne. You want it? What the hell. It's our last day. He just saved us 13 minutes. Holbrook, what is the status in ventilation? We're clean. Communication room under control. McGarry, did you check the safety areas? Everybody's asleep for the night. We're in control. Robinson, how's the party going? Clearing personnel in silo 3. I think we should renegotiate our cut. Come on, baby. Kong. Kong, you have the generator room? Kong? Kong, you have control of the generator? Kong? Holbrook, you are negative 6. Get to the fuel room, find out what happened. Kong is down. Watch it, friend. There's nobody in the fuel room. Abbot, cut all communications out of here. Hey, I had to use the phone. Abbot? McGarry, report to control room on the double. I'm there. Abbot! Chicago Plaza Court Hotel. May I help you? - This is an emergency. Major Frank Cross. WOMAN: Yes. One moment please. Wait. Do I have to remind everybody what happens if they get the word out? They will change all the launch codes. Hettinger. I'm there. Open the freaking door. Come on. Cross. Cross? Yeah. Who's this? Who the hell is this? Shoot! Guys, there's an astronaut opening our door. Space command. Listen very carefully. Another word and you're dead! I mean it! Who are you? You break into my facility, you're asking me questions? Who are you? Your facility? Sir? This is Major Cross. I dropped the black bag. Change the codes. You're not going to believe this. It's that guy we took the keys from... the rice dropper. I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. You want to cover me, Captain? Go. That's Lieutenant Colonel. Die! How did you get in here? Shoot. How do we get out! That way. Come on! He got the freaking word out. Son of a fish. Fan out. Get into the fence. Surround him now! Who's the fool doing it? This way. Fumble is confirmed. Change the codes! Lieutenant Carter speaking, announcing to let the Chief of Staff... Damn, they have the black bag. How did that happen? Long story. I repeat, a launch code alert, level one. It's broken. We're in. We're in. Change the coordinates fast. Whoa. Stop. Wrong way. Back up. Keep going straight. We'll meet each other again in about 50 yards. OK. Do it. Coordinates confirmed. Were you looking for me? Launch code change is confirmed, sir. The launch procedures are already engaged in silo 45301. We can't stop them now, sir. Romeo, alpha, 2, 4, 1, Quebec. Tango, foxtrot, 7. Launch order confirmed. Codes are authenticated and still valid. Insert launch key. Launch key inserted. On my mark, rotate launch key to set. 3, 2, 1. Set. Set. What is that? It's a launch. Missile 1 enabled. Ignition. Ignition. Shoot the warheads! If you destroy the guidance system, it won't lift off. No. How do we get it open? On my mark. Rotate to launch. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Launch. Launch. Alert 1. Alert 1. Satellite infrared WAR5 detects launch. Launch detection in Illinois. We have a missile event. This will be fine. This better be good. It's not. Specific target parameters unknown. Can't we interfere with the guidance coordinates, send it into space? It's on inertial guidance once it leaves. The only other override is in the silo. How did this happen? It's time. I'm self-destructing. No, we are not. What? What are you talking about? Sir, we've proven we have control here. And now, you'd like to prove you're afraid to blow up a rock? A rock? There's more than that... Look, this isn't the plan, sir. Aren't we supposed to be able to send a self-destruct signal to the warhead before it detonates? Haven't you already exhausted that option, Mr. President? Then how can we get it done? With the black bag. Where did that thing go? They don't tell us that. But I'm thinking they could have changed the coordinates using that black bag. Well, thanks for reminding me. Don't be too hard on yourself. Man couldn't sit on these missiles for any length of time without using them. Man? But these are terrorists. What difference does it make? I think it's much more than that. This silo's been here for 25 years. On the day they're going to take it apart, these men break into the place? No. The Almighty is sending a sign. I've arranged transportation to Air Force One, sir. It's the closest area with nuclear shielding and the necessary satellite communications. You just received a fax, sir. 8 markers right from the monument. 22 dead men in. You'll need more than a shovel here to gaze on the bones of your sin. It's a cemetery. Get out of there! I think the Almighty's done too good a job. Exhaust hatch. Bottom of silo. It's the only way out. Come on. Yes, Larry. We're live here in Chicago. And we repeat... a large explosion has just been reported in a remote area of South Dakota. Now, there's speculation that this explosion may be tied to a shooting that's taken place at the Chicago Plaza Court Hotel. The president was in the hotel at the time the shooting took place. Are there any casualties? No, we're having difficulty getting information. As a matter of fact, we don't have a report... a confirmed report on casualties at this time. That way. TO what? Come on. There's a place that's not on anybody's blueprints. We can find out where the missile went. It's totally secure. I thought this whole place was supposed to be secure? I thought you were supposed to kill yourself if you drop that black bag? I'm new. We can't go that way. That takes the exhaust from the missiles to the cooling system. We've got to go here. Approximately 100 square miles completely saturated with radiation. As you order, sir, the Army and National Guard are evacuating the area, Rapid City included. Casualties at this point are limited to those within the Mount Rushmore park area. First estimate... around 3,000 people. Get me that silo. Bob... Get me that silo now. Hello. Who is this? I don't know, Bob. When you die, do you think you keep your own name? I don't know what you're trying to do. Did you get the map I faxed? Yes, we got it. Well, you never know with these hotels. You've got 20 minutes to line up your uniform and get there. How come you didn't ask for the plain or the money? Do you have any idea what we're asking for? Any first aid here? No, just C-rations. Man, that gum is over 25-years old. You're not going to eat that mess, are you? Watch this. Everything that's happened in this facility in the last 24 hours is right here on tape. That's Decker, that traitor. I knew they couldn't get in here without somebody on the inside. Where's that? That's launch control. Damn! How come you didn't ask for the plane or the money? Do you have any idea what we're asking for? Do you think you can just ask for an A4B... The plane that serves as this country's national emergency airborne command post... And $500 million, expect them to just... drop it off? If I work them into where I want them, there will be no negotiation. Figures, Decker. A lot of those guy's only experience with a mushroom cloud is a music video. Well, what's your experience? A couple of years ago, somebody put in a training tape by mistake. I was almost responsible for starting World War III. So I started reading stuff I wasn't supposed to read. Well, how did you mange to stay here? I knew all the answers to the monthly psychological exam. But those big time, keep-up-the-morale speeches? That was the hardest. Damn, I can't make out the missile coordinates. That button right there. It's a central data recorder. Well, where did that thing detonate. That's South Dakota. Where are the other two targeted? Washington. Damn. We've got to get into that launch room. Yeah, we just got a 4-ton door to get through. Then we've got to get to the missiles. There's only one way. If they launch again, it's going to get hot. Those suits are supposed to protect you in a missile launch blast. But I never tested them myself. But there's something else we can do. I'm going to cut the power in this place. Back-up's only good for about an hour. If we can hold them off about that long, they won't have enough power left to launch a missile. I will communicate on a different frequency. You'll stay here and watch, and let me know when I can make a move on those things. You got it. T-minus 60 minutes. What's happening? Could somebody out there remind me why I need them? Won't the changes in codes prevent them from launching again? Once they tap into the system with the black bag, they have priority over any code change. Have we eliminated the ground attack? Yes, when we built the silo. But with the surveillance equipment they've got in there, they'll have one off the ground before we're even close to getting into that launch room. What's the arrival time on the bombers? The F-117's are in position and close enough to drop smart bombs in those hashes within 50 seconds of opening. What are the chances of failure? The accuracy of our laser-guided bomb 65% within 50 feet of designated targets. If we're dropping five to 10 missiles, those odds increase dramatically. I'm going there. We're talking h-bombs. If it's not 100%, I'm running out of time. We're about a minute before they're looking at another missile. Any idea how to get out to it? Didn't we talk about that? Bomb squad standing by. Freeze! Stay where you are! Put your hands on your heads! Place your hands on your heads! Who are you? There's no news, Edward. We were told to get here. By who? You have about a minute and a half with the missile before you're in site again, Well, it wouldn't take that long to shoot it full of holes. Yeah, that'd be a good idea if you didn't have number three to deal with. Look, once you're inside, pull back the insulation. And you're looking for the gold wire. Now. Damn First fricking' day. Damn. I should have taken the court marshal. Lieutenant Colonel Murphy. Boo. You made it, Bob. Murphy? I'd say, in the flesh, but I'm not quite sure anymore. Did my friends from the network get there? I'm not going to talk to you with any press around. Of course you are. Think of the ratings. Besides, we can't get to what we want without them. Just exactly what is that? The truth. My finger's on the trigger here, Bob. Who is he? We sent him into Iraq to take out Hussein. Now that everybody has the same gun we've been waving around for the last 50 years, there's no more war. Once you understand what happens to the planet if just a small percent of these things detonated, you realize it's either peace or annihilation. We've already figured out what's going to end the human race... It's just a matter of when. I'm surprised you're still running this place. I don't really have anywhere else to go. Six years ago, as your chief of staff, before Operation Desert Storm, I assigned. Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Murphy to a covert mission. When his team was in place, we, um... We reevaluated and decided, regretfully, that this mission was not appropriate for our country at this time. We were forced to abort using friendly fire. Bogus. You were forced? There were ways to get us out of there. Trying to get you out would have cost more lives, and you know that. You chose to take us out to avoid another Iran. You used one of those weapons which were supposed to save lives rather than sacrifice lives to kill your own men! You committed your life to this country no matter who made the bullets. Have you made that Same commitment? Frank, you're not going to believe this show, man. They're not going to believe it either. I'm going to put it on air channel. You go there. As general of the Armed Forces, you say you had it. As President of the United States, do you still have the same commitment? Of course I do. Hey, there's the guy that got me into this mess. Well, I'm having a hard time believing that. But that's why you're there. There must be some way you could prove to me you're as willing to die as easily as you kill, in the best interest of the country... Or should I say, in the best interest of Washington. Regardless of whose bullet it is, you have 30 minutes to say goodbye to America, or a big piece of America says goodbye to you. You son of a witch. What is going on? You know the president? Well, I'm sorry, sir. But I can't go any further with this. Well, where do you plan on going? You can't turn both keys, Colonel. Maybe I should get somebody else in here who still wants a cut. You'll get what you came for. But as to how that's accomplished, you're not making those decisions. Hey, I don't see any gold wires in here. Well, maybe there aren't any. Look, I'm not a technician. I... it's just what I heard. Well, did the same guy tell you this was the way to disable it? No. I figured it out myself. Whatever you're going to do, you've got 12 seconds to do it in. Why is the president standing in the middle of a cemetery? Because I told him to. And why haven't we heard anything about this plane that's supposed to keep our finger on the button? And what about our money? Hello? Cyclops? No, wait! They're going to be looking right at you. When I'm finished with Baker, we'll still have the missiles. And in 30 minutes, we'll have the E4B and your money. We are doomed here. Whether or not we're doomed, we won't have a missile to worry about until we stuff these guys who are trying to fuzz us up. I say, your money, because you'll also be splitting my share. I didn't come here for the money. But you're going to have to bear with me for that half hour. He's in silo 2 destroying the missile! Check It! Now move! What the... I shouldn't have to deal with... Thanks, buddy. No sign of activity down there, over. Copy, Bird's Eye. Stay focused. Hey! I've been waiting for this. Initiate launch on both missiles. It's not too late to get what I need from the president. But I can't do that without a missile. I'm not going to blow up Washington. We still have the self-destruct. If you won't take my word for it, you're going to die. Sorry. Ignition. Ignition. Enable missiles 2 and 3... all but the portholes. F-117s closing. I got heat in silos 2 and 3. Bird's Eye, if one of those portholes opens, you'll have less than a second to react. Affirmative, sir. Open porthole 2. The missiles dead. They don't know that. Bird's Eye, did you hit both portholes? Hit number 2, sir. But number 3 is still closed. Drop it all. I have no visual. It's too hot down there. It's a diversion. Drop it all right now, Bird's Eye. Open 3 and launch. Launch. Launch. Bird's Eye. I have an eagle in flight. Jesus. You may have already heard. You now have 7 minutes, 27 seconds to make your decision. The target is Washington DC. You can't do this, Doug. You don't know what you're doing. Thermonuclear detonation. The fireball that's hotter than the core of the sun. The radiation burst. It will vaporize the lucky ones. The diseases that follow the loss of immunities will make it harder to die. The deformed babies from those who seem least affected will make it harder to live. 15 million people, Bob. I know exactly what I'm doing. Doug, listen to me. You were a great soldier. And to be that soldier, I know that that part of you that could kill indiscriminately was... It was necessary. But there's more to you than that. For you to be this affected, to be this angry, that part of you... The better part of you that wants more Doug... Because you always wanted more. I mean, I understand why you feel let down. We must have been just about everything you ever had. And you offered us everything. I gave you my life. Yes, you did. And that's the good part of you that can't kill 15 million innocent people, Doug. You must destroy that missile. I don't bleed anymore. What? While everybody else was running into Desert, I watched as your missiles swallowed up my shadow. And my heart just stopped. I bleed, but not like before. There's no pulse. It's just my... my soul leading me around until I make this thing right. What are we doing? We're trying to tap into the, computer banks in the silo so that we can... I'm sorry, Bob. But, there's nothing we can do about this. The force of the explosion pushes the air around and from the center at great speed. We know that the bomb is most destructive when exploded... Billy, come on. We have to get downstairs. Above the ground. In order for a person to survive within this area, he must be protected by a shelter which can withstand the shock wave, the heat blast, and the gamma rays. Billy, come on. Of those who cannot reach the shelter, many will survive by crouching flat against cement pillars in the basement of heavy concrete buildings. Colonel, 5 minutes and 40 seconds to detonation. If I have to die for my country, I hereby resign the presidency. I'm not going to give him that. I'll give him the proof he needs that what I did, regardless of how he refuses to see it, was well-intentioned. May God forgive me. Well, what does this mean? I lied. I gave you my truth, you son of a bum. If you detonate, I promise you the slowest, most painful death that a man has ever suffered. You've already done that. But that's nothing compared to the pain you're about to experience. Missile in reentry. sir. Frank. Frank, if you're out there, man. Frank? Frank? If you're out there, man, the president's out of the picture. They're dropping the bomb on Washington DC. Look, we can't do this. I can't freaking do this! Launch command door's open. Go on. We both know you're going to have to try. How do you want to die, stick-wad? Old. No. The bag. We got to have it to stop that missile, man. What can you do from here? I don't know. Let me see. Wait. I might be able to fry the guidance circuits. If it doesn't have pre-programmed coordinates, it won't go off. But... OK You're not going to beat me, you son of a bum. No. No! God no! The computer's... The trigger's been armed. Shoot! Frank, I've done all I can do, man. I can't stop the missile. We need that black bag. Come on, Frank! There's 1 minute and 32 seconds left! You want to be a hero just like me, son. You're running out of time to save the world. Damn. We got the link back. Damn, the auxiliary power's going out. Hit it. Did I get it? I don't know. Who are you calling? Hello? Billy? Dad? Are you OK? I am now. Yes! Yeah. I'll be home soon. And I'll be here waiting, Bucko. Thank god you are all right. I can't wait to see you. Me too. If you promise to hurry back, I'll run out and buy that little thing you wanted. Bye. After all the stuff you've been through, you're going to eat that? Let's get out of here. It's going to kill you, you know that? Whatever. It's Frank Cross. Frank, over here! Frank, right here! Please, stand back. Frank, come on! He's got the black bag! Hey, let me introduce you to some of my old friends. Give us the thumbnail story. Well, I got shot up pretty early in there. So I had to hole up while he did the fighting. Lieutenant Colonel Northrop here knows a lot better than me what happened in there. REPORTER: Lieutenant Colonel. Lieutenant. Lieutenant. Time to tell them what you really think... or just give them another of your speeches. Frank! - Excuse me. Over here, please. Please. Lieutenant Colonel, there are different reports as to exactly who was responsible for what happened in there. Einstein. Frank, where are you going? Home. Toss the case in. We'll give you a lift. No, thanks. Frank, you can't just walk home with the case. What are you doing? I'll just keep this until you guys get the politics of these weapons figured out. Frank, this is nice of you. But you can't do this... By yourself I mean. Then we'll be working in shifts. Major. Lieutenant Colonel. The president wants to talk to you. No, it's all right. You know... wait a minute, aren't you that rice dropping guy? Are you kidding me? No, man. I mean, I heard one of those reporters back there say something. And I knew it was you. Damn, you're pretty famous, you know that? It's not as good as it looks. Yeah, right. You'll see.
