Abraham. - Lord... here I am. Take now your son... your only son, Isaac whom you love... and go to the land of Moriah. And there, offer him, as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you. Oh, Lord! No! No!!! Abraham? What are you doing, Abraham? All this commotion... so early! Abraham?! - The Lord's asked for a sacrifice. - He has spoken to you? He hasn't done that in years. - I must go to Moriah. - Moriah?! It'll take two days' to journey-- - It'll take three. - Why don't you build Him an altar here... as you did in Shechem? As you did in Hebron? - Because He says Moriah. - But traipsing across the wilderness, as old as we are-- - Sarah! It is not my decision to make! The Lord has said to go to Moriah. Take your questions to Him. - When do we leave? - Isaac and I will go alone. Isaac? Why Isaac? Why not one of the other men? - Because the Lord commands it... - You know how much that troubles me. - I know. - The road is a dangerous place, Abraham. - The Lord has set us on this path. He will guide us... regardless. - But still, let me rest easy. take a few other men with you. - My lord! - Eliezer. - How are you this morning? - The Lord came to me last night. - Truly?! - I haven't heard you say those words in-- - In a long time... - A very long time. - I must go to Moriah. - Moriah? What reason? - I must make a sacrifice to Him there. - Quite a distance for a sacrifice. - Sarah said the same. She said I should take a couple men along with Isaac and I. - Starting to worry about you in your old age, huh, is she? - So... who can you spare? Kelzar! - You know, you don't need to volunteer your own son. - No, I don't, but if I must stay here and manage your house, at least let me send my flesh and blood in my place. Plus, he's the best man I have. - All the more reason for him to stay here. You know, there is some truth to Sarah's worries-- the road can be... unpredictable. - Abraham... you forget, since we first entered this land decades ago, I have seen the bounds of protection the Living God has placed around you, by your side. There's no place safer for my son to be. - Lord Abraham, good morning! - Good morning, son. - Yes, Father? - The Lord called our master to a short journey, to Moriah, to give a sacrifice there. I want you to go with him... if he allows. - Of course. - Take another one of your men with you, and ensure that our master has everything he needs. - Yes, Father. When do we leave? - As soon as we can. - Father? - Is something the matter? - How is your morning, my son? - A young lamb slipped into the narrow wash in the west end. The other shepherds had to lower me down on a line to get her out. - They had to lower you down? - Someone had to do it... why not me? It set us back a bit, but... we'll make up time by day's end. - Good. - How about you, Father? How is your morning? The Lord came to me last night. - What? The Lord God?! - Yes. - In a dream?! - He stood before me... just as you stand before me now. - What did He say? - He says we are to go to Moriah, you and I... and make a sacrifice to Him there. - Moriah? Where is that? - North, about a three-day walk. Pack a bag and meet me at my tent. We leave shortly. - But my tasks-- - Eliezer will see to them. - Is everything all right? - Almost ready, making the final adjustments. - Remind me your name. - Me? Eshcolam. - You're one of the shepherds? - I do what's needed, what I'm told. I tend to their goats, mostly. - Sorry to keep you waiting, Father. - Here. - Are we ready? - Ready. - All right... let's move. Wait! Isaac! Leaving without kissing your mother? - Don't you leave without telling your mother goodbye. Hmm? Look after your father. He's not as young as he used to be. - Ha, mistress, my lord's hair may be gray, but his legs are still strong. - I'll be the judge of my husband's legs. - Look after him. - I will. - Where have the years gone? - We should be on our way. - I know. I know. Where have the years gone? Make sure no harm comes to our son. - God is with us. - God is with us. Abram? Abram?! - What's happened?! What's wrong?! - What is it, Abram? Are you harmed?! - What is it, Abram? Abram! - I... uh... I saw... God... - You saw a god? - I saw God... The God. He appeared as a man before me. He spoke to me. - What are you saying? - I must go to a land He will show me. - What? For how long? - For good. - Abram... our good name, our home, our place at the temple. - Everything has changed. I can no longer serve the gods of my father. - This is blasphemy. - You cannot blaspheme a lie. - Abram, don't say it-- - He has promised to make of me a great name... a great nation, that all the families of the earth will be blessed through... - A nation? We haven't even a son. - We will. - How long have we tried? - He will provide. He--He will make a way. - Abram, you don't even know this God! How do you know this god is even good?! How do you know He is even a god at all? - Sarai... He is. There is no other God. - How do you know this, Abram?! - I know. I know. I know. - Clear the path. - Good day, gentlemen. Where are you headed? - We're going north. - I can see that... Where? - Up beyond Hebron. - There's a tribute to be paid. This road belongs to Abimelech, King of Pelesheth. - I know who owns this road. I have given your king plenty of tributes. - Oh, you have? - Have you given a tithe of those goods you carry there? - We carry nothing of value... - Come now, if you have nothing of value, why carry it at all? - We have nothing! - Isaac! - Don't speak out of turn, boy-- your grandfather and I are having a conversation... - He is my father! - That's enough, Isaac! Nothing but food and water... Be sure to check their persons. - What is the purpose of your travels? - I go to give a sacrifice to the Lord God. - The Lord God? - What is your name, old man? - Abraham. - Once called Abram? Of the Kasdim? - The man who defeated the kings of the east and freed the captives of Sodom... all with an army of shepherds? - That was a long time ago. - Our king speaks highly of you. Mount up. We're losing the light. - May your God watch over you... the road holds the unexpected. Beware of the wild beasts... careful the animals as well. - Seafaring dogs. - Those are my people. - That's right... I forgot. Well, next time can you tell your people not to scatter our supplies all over the road? Praise be to God, He has delivered you from that path. We should start camp before it's full night. - Mm. These are good. - That horseman today... he spoke of you leading an army... When was this? There was no army... only herdsmen... armed with whatever weapons we could find. - And... the power of God. - For what purpose? Why did you need to save the Sodomites? - Kings from Shinar in the east had come up against the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah and their surrounding cities. They pillaged all they could find and took those left there captive. They made it beyond Damascus before we could reach them. I had family among the captives... So I did what I had to do. - My father's rarely spoken of this. - I know. - To travel that far... putting your life on the line... rescuing all those people... only to have them burn with their cities later. You must have felt your efforts were for nothing. - The people of Sodom were deeply wicked and depraved. We are no different... when we go our own way. Abram. - Lord! To your descendants... I will give this land. Count the stars if you are able. So shall your descendants be. - Father... Father! Father. The sun is risen. - It's late. - Behold your inheritance... ...a dead land. Your flocks are starving. Your people will soon starve as well. What now, Abram? Hmm? This--this God has lead you right into a famine. - The Lord has made a promise... - My time has come upon me once again. So not only has He lead you to a barren land... He has made your wife to be barren as well. We can't stay here. We need to go back home... - No... no turning back. - Then what, Abram?! - I have heard from the women here that many of them are going to Egypt. The river is full and the land, fertile. Maybe we should go there as well. - So, Esh... you think your mother's faring well without you? - I suppose. The northern flock was just sheared. She's so busy, she may not have even noticed I've gone. How 'bout your mother? - I'm certain she fares better than any of us... being now in the Lord's presence. - Oh, that's right. I forgot. - That's all right. Your mother, however... she's probably in a living hell with you gone. - What's happened here? - Who would leave all this behind? - That doesn't belong to us. - What a waste. - We should get moving. - There's someone here! - Isaac, wait! - Sir?! Sir, what happened?! Who did this to you? - They took my daughter. He's bled out a lot! - We should load him into his cart and take him back to Hebron. - Th-they... took... my daugh-ter. - What? Who's they? The men. - What men? What men? What men? What men?! Who could have done this? - The horsemen. - From yesterday? - How can you be so sure?! - What do we do with him? - Nothing. - Shouldn't we bury him? - What for? For him to lie in an unknown grave? If he's buried, he's forgotten. If he's left here by the road, he stands as a witness... a witness to the depth of which mankind has fallen. Is that Hebron? Yes. - That's Hebron. - We going in? - Now. - What are you doing? - Praying... - Wait! - We don't pray like this anymore, like the old ways. We pray to The Lord Most High... not to stones or the stars or the moon... - I do pray to Him... and I pray to Him... and I pray to Him... ...just as you said we should. But why doesn't He hear me? - He hears you. He does. - It's been ten years... ten years... since we left home. You say-- you say He promised us land... yet we haven't even a plot to our name. You said He promised us descendants; yet here I am, still barren... and aging. - The Lord will provide. - When, Abram?! When? - When He wills. - You cannot have a nation... if you cannot even have a son. How much longer? How much longer, Lord? Do not be afraid, Abram. I AM your shield... your exceedingly great reward. - Lord God, what will You give me, seeing I remain childless? And the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus. You have given me no offspring. A servant in my house is my heir. [coughing} A servant in my house is my heir. This servant shall not be your heir... but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir. - Some men are approaching. Prepare the tent. Turn aside men, come. I have beauties for all your tastes. Come! Anything you want, I have it, I have it! If these are not to your liking, I have even more in my city! Relax, you deserve it! Or not. Whatever you want! Whatever you wish! Satisfy your desires. Keep to the path. - Come! Whatever you wish, I have. He who is weary, will find rest here! It's different than I remember it. - You lived in Hebron? We all did. That was before Isaac's time. I was actually born there. - Was Ishmael born there as well? - Yes... he was born there as too. - Sarai! - What? What on earth? - The Lord came to me! - Hagar, bring a bowl of water! - Are you hurt?! - No. - Where have you been? It's been over a day. - With the Lord. He came to me. First, in a vision and then here in this tent. - What? - Then He took me out into the night. - Mistress... - Place it on the table. - And? - He says--He says He will give me descendants as numerous as the stars! - My lord... - I'll take care of it. - Here, sit. When I woke yesterday, I looked everywhere for you. Before long, I began to panic. - I'm sorry. - I thought the Mesopotamians had come in retaliation and taken you from me. - I should have told you. I'm sorry. - Finally, I found Eliezer. He said you had taken a heifer and some livestock. - Yes, yes, the Lord has-- - Required a sacrifice? - No. He has made a covenant... the promise of descendants and this land. - Abram, I heard this before. - No, but now there's more. The Lord has made a covenant. It cannot be broken. - Well, how does He intend to bring this to pass? Through the line of Eliezer? - Eliezer of Damascus will no longer need be my heir. The Lord has said that my heir will come from my own body. - Your body. - Yes. - Your body. I am like a dry seed in the summer sun... I can bear you no heir. - No... the Lord has said-- - The Lord has said He will make a nation of you ... give you descendants... give you an heir... of your body... not mine. - No. - Yes. For ten years-- for ten years He has promised this. I understand now. I understand. If the Lord has restrained me from bearing children... go into my maid, Hagar, the Egyptian. - Why would you say that? - Perhaps through her I'll bear children. - No, I can't! I can't go and lie with-- - Abram, noble men back home do the same. - But this can't be the Lord's plan. - When He first came to you in Ur, He told you to leave your country. He told you to leave your family, hmm? Maybe all along... you needed to have left me. - No. Sarai-- - Husband, He has a plan for you. - Sarai. - I will not stand in your way. - You're not standing in the way of that. You're standing by my side. You're my wife. - Yes... now, let me be a good wife. - We'll stop there and make camp. I'll gather wood and kindling for the fire. - Why don't you have Esh do that? - No. We need to be unpacked before we lose the light. - Yes, right. - We can use some of the wood we already have. - No. We'll need all of it... for tomorrow. - Father! It's only me. - This place is sprawling with wolf tracks. Should we move camp? - No; they'll fear the light, once the fire's lit. - They're nearly all set, so I thought I'd come and give you a hand. - All right. tie this bundle. Get the fire started before we're in the dark. - My lord. May I ask you a question? Why is the Lord having you trek all this way for a sacrifice? - I don't know. - You don't know?! - Well, if sacrifices earn greater favor, then you're sure to gain-- - The Lord's favor is not earned. - But... how can you say that, when, clearly, you've earned it yourself? - I have earned nothing. One who thinks he can stand before the Most High God and offer his own filthy, feeble deeds as a bargain... is blind to the holiness of God, and blind to the depths of his own sin. - Blind... So am I blind? Esh! - Everyone's blind... until their eyes are opened. - Is that some sort of riddle? - If the Lord God stands infinitely holy... then any sin must pit us infinitely opposed to Him. How can a man bridge such a chasm? We are lost at sea paddling into the wind... until the Lord comes to us ... He makes the way. I gave sacrifice after sacrifice in the temples of the gods of my fathers... thinking I was nearing the divine. But all of it, all that effort, all those rites and rituals, all I was doing was-- was paddling into the wind. - You were sacrificing to the wrong gods. - False gods. But even if I were sacrificing in the name of the Lord, my faith was placed in my own abilities, not His-- how much I could give, how much I could do. I believed I could-- I believed I could... right my own wrongs. But, in spite of it all, in spite of all I'd done... in spite of myself, while on my way to serve those demons I called gods, the Lord Himself came to me. He appeared before me. And--and in an instant, I was undone. When I saw Him, I saw myself for who I really was-- worthless, apart from His grace. - Your eyes were opened. - Then why all this way? Why go all this way? Go through all this effort? - Because this is what the Lord commands. - If He's the One who makes the way, why would He require sacrifices? - I suppose... He has us do this in remembrance, as a reminder. - To remind us of what? - That death is the penalty for sin. - But how is that not--? As you make sacrifices, you are, yourself, making payments for the sins you've done, righting your own wrongs. The death you say He requires... it is a life for a life. How does the life of an animal measure up to that of a man? - It cannot. - Then why journey all this way, if only for some symbol; if that's all it is? Esh, that's enough belaboring. - Who can know the mind of God, His ways, His thoughts? He has His reason for commanding a sacrifice, be it a symbol, or a memorial, whatever the purpose, the Lord knows... and it must be good. - You believe that? - I must believe that. - I don't know, to trek so far... seems more like some act of penance for some great sin. - She shall be a wife to you as well. - Lord have mercy. - Oh, Lord... my sin has been great before You, I know. And if this is Your retribution, it is just. But Lord God, I beg You... I beg You for Your mercy. Do not let my sins be on my son's head... the son You promised. What's Your purpose in this? If this is Your judgment on me... then take my life, not his. Take my life, not his. Not his, Lord; take me. Take me. Take me! Take me!! Lord, I lay--I lay my life down at Your feet. It is Yours. Please hear me, Lord. Please grant me this, by Your grace, Lord, please... please. Please hear me. Please. Please. - Your brazenness last night... is unacceptable. You will show him respect. - Just as he shows respect to me and my people? - Esh... he's right when he tells you that you're better off in his house than with those people. They're ruthless and wicked. - So I should drop down and kiss his feet for giving me the honor of being his slave? - Much better to be a slave to the righteous than a slave to the wicked. - Righteous? Are you delusional? Or is your flattery only because of your position? - What position? - You're the son of the chief servant. Do you not see how advantageous your situation is? - I love my master. - With Ishmael and his mother, Hagar, banished, if anything were to befall Isaac, His inheritance would revert back to your father, back to you. - No. - Oh, so this has crossed your mind. - Stop. Isaac is my friend. - And Ishmael was mine! - You've given the devil a foothold in your mind. Shut your mouth and put away those thoughts. - Think of your progeny. How else will they be anything more than slaves? - That's enough! Don't give me a reason to bring a report to my father. - Your master's not as righteous as you claim... - Sarai? What's wrong? - Everything is wrong. - What? - Don't play ignorant with me! I have followed you all these years. I have clung to you through every trial, every day, every week, every month, year after year... waiting for what you claimed the Lord has promised. And now, after all this... what do I have? Hmm? A husband that I must share... a bed that has been stained... and a hope that has faded away. No. No! Don't act like you care for me! It's you! - It's your fault! All of this is your fault! Your fault; it's all I have. No... I'm such a fool. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for this long-suffering. We must believe the Lord's working something in it all. Look at me. We must cling to our faith. - As you did... when you went into my handmaiden? - You gave her to me. I protested. - You protested?! - Yes. - The child in her belly would say otherwise! - You suggested that. - I was a wife striving to please her husband! Seeing the disappointment in your eyes, month after month, year after year. It broke me, Abram. I was broken. So in weakness, I gave my maid into your embrace. But you-- you embraced her! You took her! You laid with her! You! You! And now that she has conceived, I am disgraceful in her eyes-- walking around like this is her household. I hear the whispers. The way she looks at you. The way she looks at me. She vies for my place. And she has it. - No. - Yes! - No, she doesn't have it. - You may have your heir, you may have your nation, you may have everything. But know this... your house now stands divided, Abram. And it's on you, Abram. Let the Lord be the Judge between you and I. - Listen to me. My wife, I-- I-- - You what? - She does not have your place... If there's any contention, do with her as you will. Hagar is your maid. - Do not preach to me about faith any longer. Is today the day? - Hmm? - We'll make it to Moriah today? Yes. We'll make it to Moriah today. Beautiful. How can the Lord be so good-- as to give us all this? What can we ever give in return? - We should be on our way. - Father?! What have I done? - You have done nothing. - Your silence and separation these past few days... what is it? - Sometimes... sometimes the Lord calls us to great tasks... impossible tasks. - Is anything too difficult for the Lord? - No. No, my son... no. All's loaded and ready, my lord! Is this it? This is Ephrathah. - I have never noticed that before. Is that from your time in Egypt? No... these aren't Egyptian. - What does it say? - I don't know. This was my father's staff. It was his father's before him, His father's before him, and so on, It's a language now forgotten, I suppose. - I never knew that. - And some day he'll hand it down to you. May I see it? Wow. This is amazing. - One more thing for you to inherit. - These last days on the road, a question has lingered in my mind. If you were willing to save wicked Sodomites from the hands of foreign kings all those years ago... why do you hold such a bitter disdain for the Pelishtiy, my people, today? I do not disdain them. - Then why are you so quick to belittle them, and so quick to blame them for the murder of that man on the road? - I disdain their deeds-- and I blame them for that man's murder... and for the robbing of his daughter, because it is like them to do such a thing. - Oh, it's like them to do so? - Yes. - And how do you know this? - Because they once took my wife. They placed her in the harem of Abimelech their king. But the Lord plagued his house and his people. So when he found out she was my wife, he gave her back-- along with wealth and servants as repayment. And so you and your mother entered into my household. Praise God Abimelech hadn't yet lain with her. - That still doesn't prove that that man's daughter was taken by men of Pelesheth. - No, it doesn't, but the odds are in their favor. Wicked kings are renowned for storing up stolen women. Ask your mother if she would disagree. Ultimately, however, in this world, all men are capable of such evil. - Even you? - Yes, even me. Apart from my God's grace, all men are capable of much worse. Praise God that He has delivered you out from under such taskmasters. - You pride yourself on being a safe haven for pagan refugees? - Pride myself? If I can point man back to his Creator... then to God be the glory. - Point man back to his Creator. Is that what you were doing when you banished your own son with his Egyptian mother? - Eshcolam! My father will hear of your insolence! - It's all right. I'd rather answer his question and bring truth to light than allow animosity to fester. When Isaac was very young, Ishmael's scoffing towards him became too much to bear. We had seen the same contention in his mother years before. Eventually, the Lord had said to send them away. - The Lord said. - It brought me great pain... but the Lord says He will make a great nation of him as my seed... and that 12 princes will come from his line. - Does that help settle your conscience? - Get out! - I'm not finished! - Yes, you are! - You give yourself license to do whatever you wish as long as you can say, "the Lord has said!" Bastardize your son-- Kelzar, wait. --enslave whoever you wish, Kelzar! mutilate the men of your house! - Wait! - I know your intentions! You come plant yourself here in my homeland and seek to build a slave army to overthrow my people! You think you deserve this land?! - No... no; neither do you. What man deserves any good thing in this world? - You expect me to praise your God for giving me the privilege of being your slave... ...O master of righteousness ?! - That's it! I'm going to bring you back home by a rope! Isaac, grab the vine. - What torments you, Abraham?! Take your hands off me! Tell us what you're hiding! What you scream of at night! Ahh! - This is my land! Well done, old man. Seems our warrior shepherd is still one to be reckoned with... even in the twilight of his years! Abram of the Kasdim. - Abraham. - Having a bit of a scuffle, are we? You know, you shouldn't charge your master like that. Especially one known to conquer kings. You'll be fortunate if he doesn't put you to death for it. It's only a misunderstanding. If I'm not mistaken, you were headed to Hebron. Did you miss it? It's a day's walk back that way. - "Beyond Hebron" is what I said. - Beyond... certainly well beyond. If you were more truthful, I would've been more intentional about collecting a tithe for the extent of which you used my king's road. - Looks to me like you've taken enough "tithes" already! - Isaac, quiet yourself! - Looks to me you need a lesson in speaking out of turn, boy. - We are far from the coast. Abimelech has no territory this far into Canaan. - Our king is a man of ambition. - And since when does tithing require robbing a poor father of his daughter? - You speak of what you do not know, boy. - Put your sword away. You can take whatever you want. - I know exactly of what I speak... a man slain on the road, whose dying lips only spoke of his stolen daughter. - Isaac! You snakes! You think you can flee the condemnation that awaits you?! - Come to me. I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. - Let the girl go! - We've come only to sacrifice to the Lord God! Take what you want; we'll be on our way! - How about I take you as a tithe? - You will not! - So be it. My life... for hers. She's used goods now anyway. We can make him an effeminate! - Many in the court will love that! - You will do nothing... other than leave right now! - Stop! How about I cut a tenth of your son's body... we'll call it a day? - My son speaks the truth. You cannot escape the eternal torment that awaits you. The road you're on now will only lead to fire and flame. Now, let go of my son! - Isaac! - Watch out! Do not preach to me about faith any longer. If all your hopes were dashed upon the rock... and all that you loved was lost... would your faith still stand? Or would you curse God to His face? Should I hide what I am about to do from Abraham? For I have chosen him, so that he will command his children and his house after him, to keep the way of the LORD. This is how the LORD will fulfill to Abraham what He promised him. Get away from him! Don't touch him! Captain! The king will have your head if he gets word of this! You must leave now! It's not worth it! Saddle her up. Let's go... I'll leave them for the vultures. I am God Almighty. Walk before Me and be blameless. My Lord! Isaac! No longer shall you be called Abram. Abraham shall be your name. For I have made you a "Father of many nations." As for your wife, no longer shall you call her Sarai. Sarah shall be her name. She shall be the mother of nations. Kings of peoples shall be from her. I will bless her indeed. Your wife, Sarah, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name-- Father!! --Isaac. - Father, are you all right?! I will confirm my covenant with him... as a permanent covenant. - I'm all right, my son; I'm all right. Are you all right... my love? Are you all right? Sarah? - I feel... there's a child growing in my belly. - Are you certain?! - It's impossible! Who would believe it?! - Is anything too difficult for the Lord? - We'll go up and worship; then come back to you. - My mother... and my father... devoted their lives to the gods of Damascus-- striving to earn favor from wood and stone. Then one day, that man entered their city. Where would I be without him? Where would my mother be? When all of the world went wicked, the Lord chose that man out from the wicked, that hope may endure. My Lord Abraham! Father? - I'm here, my son. - We have the fire, the wood... but... where's the lamb for the burnt offering? Your son! Your son is here! God Himself will provide a lamb for the burnt offering. There... - The wood, now. I don't deserve this. God is so good to us. He keeps His promises. What's wrong? - Forgive me. - For what? - The Lord has said-- the Lord has said for you to be the sacrifice. - What? Wh-why? - I don't know. - Ask Him. Speak to Him; perhaps there's another way. - I did! Every night as I lie awake! Every moment of our journey! Every step toward this place, this has been my heart's constant cry. Silence has been His only answer. - Have I done wrong? - No... no. You have done no wrong in my eyes. - Am I not the son He intended for you? - You are! You are the son of promise. He has promised a great nation through you... you, Isaac; He has called you by name. - Why then must you kill me? - I don't know. I don't know. Whatever He's doing in all this... whatever He's trying to teach... whatever He's trying to show... I'm lost. I begged for Him to let me lay my own self down... but that's not what He's asked for. So, now-- now, I must lay down my son, my only son, whom I love. And we must have faith that our God, the giver and the taker of life... has the power to give life once again. I believe that. Look at me. I know that. I know that. - As do I. I don't want this. But... not my will... let His be done. - Give me the strength to do Your will. Abraham! Abraham! - Here I am. Here I am, Lord. Do not lay a hand on the young man. Do nothing to him. Now I know that you fear God... since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me. - What's happened?! - He has spared you! The Lord has spared you! A substitute. The Lord will provide in this place. Here... in the Mount of the LORD it shall be provided. By Myself I have sworn. Because you have not withheld your son, your only son, in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed... - Truly, this Man was... the Son of God.
