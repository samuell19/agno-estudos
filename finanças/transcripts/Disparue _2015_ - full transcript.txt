Jean, it's Flo. Can you put Julien on, please? Really? But wait, why? Did they find something? THE DISAPPEARANCE Episode Two It's you I wanted to see. What's happening? - Sorry? - The Dubois file, remember? We're working on it. Our neighbour got his permit in two weeks' time. That's because you're not in the same zone. What's that got to do with it? It's bad enough that we have to get permission. - Making us wait is frankly... - Goodbye. HAPPY BIRTHDAY He loves his daughter. Maybe a bit too much. Why didn't you say you found Léa's presents? Where did you find them? OK. The night of Friday to Saturday. I've already told you everything. Your poker friends left you at 3:00 a.m.? Yes, so? Your wife said you arrived home at 4:00. I told you that. But the restaurant is only 10 minutes away. How could it take an hour? I walked a bit before going home. Walked? Except a witness saw you park your van at 3:45 a.m. outside the restaurant. It was 3:45. I saw the clock when I went out for a smoke. Morel's van arrived at that exact moment. Where had you been? None of your business. Why did you need the van? Why all these questions? Forty-five minutes. Forty-five minutes. The length of a return trip to the Tête d'Or Park. What are you implying? No one knows where you were when your daughter disappeared. Shit! We'll talk again when you've calmed down. Where's my husband? There are discrepancies regarding his whereabouts. Mr Morel is helping us resolve them. - I see. Nothing new? - No. Have a seat. Your husband seems very close to your teenage daughter. He is. They've always been very close, ever since she was a baby. Thomas and Zoé, too, but it's not the same. When you say close, could that have bothered her? Oh, no. No, she... She takes advantage of it. Gets him to do what she wants. What are you implying? I'm just trying to understand what kind of father he is. Julien's an excellent father. - Is that all? Can I go? - By all means. SCHOOL Mum! Hey, Mum! - Mum! - Sorry. All right, darling? Had a good day? Let's have a snack. Yes. I want a list of all the cars flashed the night of the disappearance, between the restaurant and the park. - You hope to find Morel's van? - Yes. You really think that guy could... I don't know, have that kind of relationship with his daughter? In the Minors Squad, I saw a lot of incest cases. Young people, old people, jerks, intellectuals. - But someone in the family always knows. - Commander! I found out who gave what gift, except this one. They're gloves for racing. Hey! Why weren't you practising yesterday? I left you a message. I was with the cops. That's not my problem. The race is in a month, and you're far from ready. Léa's disappeared. I don't get it. She's been gone two days, since the music festival. Hi, Mum, you OK? Great. You? Eh? No, I told you we broke up! Because he's an asshole, that's why. Yes, I'm eating. Normally. A steak and green beans. Mum, I've got work to do. Bye. Lieutenant Camille Guérin. May I ask you a few questions? It won't take long. Yes, they're my gloves. Léa gave them to me Friday night. They're not your size. I know. She got the wrong size. She was going to change them. Don't take me for an idiot. My father's pretty cool. - Well, nothing special. - And Léa? They're rather alike. But she's closer to my mother now. - They do stuff together. - More than with your father? It's different. He's dodgy. His girlfriend kept looking at him nervously. I checked their initial statements. They match word for word. But the witness statements vary wildly. We'll question them again. - Not drinking your coffee? - I don't drink coffee. - Hello. - Hello. - Karine? What is it? - Nothing serious. Your daughter is unbearable. I'm tired of dealing with her on my own. - I'm here now. - That's why she's staying with you. - I just moved in, I'm swamped with work. - Look. Rose keeps saying she'd rather be with you. You'll be able to catch up. I'll call you. Stop freaking out. We stick to our story, that's all. Don't worry. - I keep thinking of Léa. - I don't want to. Sorry. - Still nothing? - No. - Hi. - Hi. - Want a drink? - Sure, a beer, a Coke... Still no news of Léa? No, but... I have to talk to you. Yeah, OK. Look, I didn't want Léa to find out, but at least things are clear. What do you mean? That we're together. I love you... Stop it! I love Léa. I slept with you because I was mad at her, and I regret it. Even more so now. I don't want to talk about it. Bye, guys. - You OK? What's going on? - Nothing. Why chase him? He's Léa's guy. - Yes, I know. - No sense making trouble. You've no reason to keep me here! You should be looking for my daughter. I can do both at the same time. Tell me what you were doing, and I can get on. It's nothing to do with Léa. I left the restaurant at 3:00. A young woman was waiting for me. Anne Bucher. She worked for me for a while last year. I had an affair with her. My wife found out. I didn't want to ruin everything, so... Anne left the restaurant. Stop it now. You bastard, you never call me! I'm sick of it! But Anne was obsessed. - Calm down. - I miss you! You're drunk, that's all. I had no choice but to take her home. Tell me what happened Friday night with Mr Morel. I saw him that night. He came to my place around 3:00. You didn't go to the restaurant? Earlier, yes. But he came to see me after his poker game. On foot or by car? By car, I think. I forget. Sure it wasn't a van? Yes, maybe. What time did you go to the restaurant? Around 1:00. The restaurant was still open? Yes. It was just closing. Then Mr Morel came to your place? Yes. He stayed from 3:00 to 3:45. That's precise. You're vague about all the rest, but on that, you're very precise. That's surprising. Tell me what really happened. Julien asked me to say I was with him between 3:00 and 3:45. That's impossible! I told the truth! I swear. Anne's lying! - Sit down. - Calm down, Julien. Your solicitor may not take part in the interview. Nor have access to the proceedings. Let's start again. Friday night, you played poker... - I splashed you, sorry. - Watch out! Mum? - Mum! - Wait a second. Yes? What's going on with Dad? Keep playing, darling. I'll just be five minutes. You can dry yourself. What's going on? Not in front of your sister! Why have they arrested him? I don't know. Paul didn't say anything? I didn't speak to him, Jean did. - I'm going. - Come on, Thomas. I'll go. Get Zoé out of the bath and make her dinner. Paul! Why are they still holding him? Come on. No, I want to know why. - Why can't we see him? - He's in custody. Yes, but why? Come on, I'll explain. Mum, will you play a video game with me? What's wrong with Mum? Let's leave her alone. - Want to do a game on the PlayStation? - Yes. - What do you want to play? - Football. Football? Is Mum sick because of Léa? No, she's just tired. I'd like Léa to come back, I want everything to be like before. Don't worry, it'll be OK. Sleep now. Can you stay with me a while? Sometimes Léa lies down next to me. I like that. - Goodnight, Thomas. - Goodnight, Zoé. Pretty, isn't it? - You had it done? - Yes. It's a bit sore. You idiot! I hope you didn't pay for it. - Hold on... - Stop it! Thanks. I know Julien told the truth. How can you possibly think he did anything to Léa? I don't know. I've seen that Anne near the restaurant before. She's crazy. She didn't want to break up, and... What are you doing? I don't know. Sorry, the council meeting ran on. Never mind. You OK? I'm meeting Chris and Nicolas at the restaurant. - Call me if you get any news? - Yes. Here. Sorry, there is stuff everywhere. What's going on? They want to run tests. That's normal, it's an investigation. I told you, it ended at 3:00, and Anne arrived as I was locking up. - You were alone? - Yes, they had all gone. - Of course. - She must've waited for me. - She was drunk. - You saw no one? No. Shit, in custody! Why are the cops holding him? - Maybe he's hiding something. - He's not the type. You lied to them. I had no choice. I was protecting you. Where am I meant to sleep? You can have the bed, I'll take the sofa. I'm not staying long. Really? Where will you go? It's the holidays soon. I'm not spending them in Lyon, no way. - What are we eating? - Pizza. No, sushi. Sushi... I agree with Jean, it's that bitch Anne who lied. Don't talk like that. - OK, that whore, then. - Stop it! That's not the point. I don't believe it... Here they are. So... Take half tonight. You need sleep. Don't come to work tomorrow. I'll take over your files until this gets sorted. What if it doesn't? It's been three days. Why doesn't she come home? I want my baby, Sophie! Farmers are still angry, and this time, they've decided to... Up already? - Yeah. - You didn't take my pill? - Look who's here! - Mum! Give me a kiss. Did you sleep well? Yes, Sophie woke me up. Great, I made your cereal. I'm feeling fine. You don't have to go to work. I'm not coming in today. Have a good day, girls. See you tonight. I'll call you. An extraordinary meeting chaired not by the President but by the Prime Minister, a first for the Fifth Republic... I've nothing to say to you. I have. - Get out or I'll call the cops! - That's exactly what I want. You can tell them why you lied about Julien. - Tell them the truth. - Julien needs me now. Too late. Too bad for him! My daughter has been missing for four days, and you dare to use that on your lover? If anything happens to her because of you, I'll kill you. You can tell that to the cops as well. No problem. DO NOT THROW AWAY - Morning. - Morning. Morel's mistress called. No message. She said she'd call you back. See you, then! You wanted to speak to me? Come in. You're telling me you didn't "exactly" tell the truth? Julien did bring me home. But... But? Maybe I got the time wrong. "Not exactly, maybe..." Don't waste my time. - Want to change your statement? - Yes. What Julien said is true. I don't know why I did it. I wanted revenge. I didn't realise... That's called false testimony. - I'm sorry. - That won't do it. I'm telling the truth. We'll see. We'll check it out. Meanwhile, come to the station, and we'll take your statement. You'll need a lawyer. - I have to tell you... - Wait till we're home. When you were here, Paul told me horrible things. I doubted you. Please forgive me. Forgive me. Mr Morel! - Why were you in custody? - Any news in the investigation? They've been here since this morning. Please move away! - Anything to say, Mr Morel? - What hope for your daughter? How do you feel now, Mr Morel? Léa, if you can hear me, Disappearance of Léa MOREL just come home. Come back home, darling. - Come... - So, where are we at? Nowhere. We found nothing, neither in the park nor in the lake. And the girl's things? Nothing on the PC, but IT are working on deleted e-mails. - The father? - Alibi confirmed. - Speed traps? - No cars were flashed. The press will be expecting progress. I didn't wait for the press to move on. I told them. Léa gave me the gloves. I saw another pair here the other day? And those gloves she "gave" you are too small for you. She got the size wrong. Only Léa buys me shirts the right size. Enough. - Tell the truth, or I will. - Stop it, Dad. The truth about what? The gloves are Léa's. I don't understand. Léa does Formula FR, too. Single-seaters, racing. She'd been watching me drive. Shit. Marco wanted her to try out a car. We realised she was gifted. In a few weeks, she was as fast as me. She came back, it became her passion. That's impossible. We'd have known. I'm sorry. She made me swear never to tell you because... Because she knew you'd object. Because of your brother's accident. Where is this circuit? I'm looking for Marco Berti. - He's by the tracks. - Thanks. - Are you Léa Morel's instructor? - Yes. What's it about? I'm her father. Here's the authorisation, signed by her parents. - You never check? - I never thought to. The lessons are expensive. The parents normally pay. Léa's are half-price. Why? She's gifted. I've never seen such talent. I don't understand where she got the money. She always pays in cash. She said it was easier for you. Other than Romain, does she see anyone else here? No. She practices, then leaves. I told the police all I know. They've been here already? Commander Molina, yes. We've ruled out the parents. What about Thomas Morel? He says he was with his girlfriend, Audrey. Commander, Mr Morel wants to see you. - What is it? - Why didn't you tell me? - The gloves, her instructor... - I decide what to tell you. - I demand to be kept informed. - We have nothing. Nothing significant. Let me do my job. If your daughter disappears, I hope you won't have to deal with a cop like you. He's worried sick about his daughter. Don't be so hard on him. Better a grumpy good cop than a polite bad one. Neither has found his daughter. OK... Did you know Léa took coke? - What are you talking about? - Cut the crap! This is serious, Chris. Look... We all take it occasionally. But only at parties. So where did this come from? Where did it come from? I don't know. It was always Léa who bought it. - Don't tell Dad... - What do I care about telling your father? Did you know about the motor racing? Well, yes, she would go see Romain... No, everyone knows that. Léa drives, too. You didn't know? No. No. No. No, I swear. How long? I don't fucking know! Can you tell me anything else about my daughter? No. MISSING Look what I found. She used her bank card at Le City at 2:40. Nothing since. The card got here after her fight with Romain. Why was she here at 3:00 a.m.? Search the park. It's open space, 2,300 hectares. The lake is huge. - It'll take weeks. - Better start now, then. - What's with the vans? - They're prostitutes. - Where do they work? - On the paths, over there. It won't make it any easier. I hope you enjoyed it. Dad... Julien! Music festival has been missing for five days. Today, her bank card was found at Miribel Park, investigators say. A search is taking place throughout the park, overseen by Commander Molina. It's painstaking work... She's blonde, 1.7 metres tall. She was wearing dark blue shorts and a light silk top. Did they say anything else? It's hard. The number on screen. The leak didn't come from us. Why would we... I don't care. - I want to see Molina. - He has left for the day. What? He's gone home when he should be searching for my daughter? Where's his superior? Mr Morel, calm down. Don't make me arrest you again. - Hello. Do you know this girl? - No. Ever seen her? Look. - No. - Are you sure? Hello. Do you know this girl? Has she been here? Look. No? Are you sure? - Hello. - Hello. Do you know this girl? - No. - Are you sure? - Look again. - I said no. It's important... - Wait... - I'm working! She's my daughter! I know you've seen her. - Answer me! - You're crazy! Tell me where my daughter is! Calm down, asshole! Stop! Stop. - Get lost. - OK. How many times do I have to tell you? Come on. Slowly. Slowly! Take it easy. He really got you. You think whores and pimps will tell you what they saw? OK. In a police station with cops, we have ways... I had to do something while you... What do you think I'm doing here? Conducting a survey? Go home, take care of your family, and let me do my job. Thanks. Are you OK? Turn around. I can't believe she's involved. She recognised her. Her photo's everywhere. It's not that. She really knew her. - She was going to say... - Keep still. Then she changed her mind. I don't know my daughter any more. She hid so much from us. Do you know anything else? Of course not. I promise. Go back to bed. Who is it? What? Daddy? It's Léa. If you're there, pick up! Daddy, pick up! Daddy, I...
