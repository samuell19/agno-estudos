The first professional film by Josef von Sternberg was unusually bold both subject matter and technical skill. It framed the style of all gangster films to come. A great city in the dead of night... ...streets lonely, moon-flooded... ...buildings empty as the cliff-dwellings of a forgotten age - "The great Bull Weed - closing another bank account." "That's what makes bums and squealers!" "I may be a bum, but I am no squealer. I might say, sir, that I am a Rolls-Royce for silence." "All right, Rolls Royce - I'll give you a chance to prove that." "Keep your eyes off her! What do you think I'm here for?" LA POLIC?A DA CAZA A LOS ATRACADORES DEL AUDAZ ROBO DE LA SEMANA PASADA La polic?a estrecha el cerco a los pistoleros que reventaron el banco... "Watch me show that dame what I think of money." "Buck Mulligan's looking for trouble." "How'd you like to pick up ten bucks?" "Pick it up or I'll send you to the morgue!" "Give me that gun!" "Rolls Royce, meet Feathers - my girl." "How long since you had the body washed and polished, Rolls Royce?" "If you don't want Mulligan to bump you off, Professor, you'd better stick with me." "With pleasure, sir." "Come on, let's drift!" "Can I possibly be of any assistance?" LA CIUDAD ES TUYA COMPA??A DE INVERSIONES A.B.C. "The city is yours, Kid - what'll you have?" "Attila, the Hun, at the gates of Rome." "Who's Attila? The leader of some wop gang?" "You were born two thousand years too late. You can't get away with your stuff - nowadays." "They'll never get me!" "I'm either a missionary or a sucker, but I'm going to put you on your feet." "What could I do to help you?" "Help me? Nobody helps me! I help other people!" FLORISTER?A MULLIGAN Especial de MULLIGAN DESCANSE EN PAZ... BULL WEED "I'm going to bury that guy while these lilies are still fresh!" But Buck should have used wax flowers, for long after his lilies had faded - - "You don't want that junk. It's too vulgar!" "Why, it's the old hideaway! Why did you bring me here?" "Don't you know it's wrong to steal?" "Look at him - cost me a thousand - looks like a million!" "He's read every book in the case - he likes to read!" "Let's have the key, Professor." "A perfect getaway - - through our warehouse to the next block. And nitro couldn't blow those doors!" "No, thanks. I've got to go out on important business." "The police all know Mulligan's Special. Plant the little flower where it will do the most good." "I told you that guy had brains." "You stay here. You may have the brains, but I've got the guts." "What were you before Bull Weed picked you up?" "A lawyer sometimes - a drunkard always ... what does it matter?" "A woman, I suppose." "I'm not interested in women." "The Captain wants to see you." "Say - what is this - a pinch?" "Somebody framed me!" "Framed you? Since when are you a picture, Buck?" "You've got the wrong guy this time. I'll be out in twenty minutes." "Is this why you're called Feathers?" "I wear feathers all over." "What were you before Bull Weed - er - found you?" "I thought you weren't interested in women!" "Bull Weed's our best friend, isn't he?" "This is the first time in a long while that I've felt ashamed." "Well, I planted that flower. They've probably pinched Mulligan by now." "See you at the Ball tonight?" "You've got to show. Everybody with a police record will be there!" "Besides, I'm going to make Feathers queen of the ball." "- be there! Them's orders!" The underworld's annual armistice - when, until dawn, rival gangsters... ...bury the hatchet and park the machine-gun. ADQUIERA SU VOTO EN LA CASETA POR 1$ "Check your gats!" "Vote for Feathers!" ADQUIERA SU VOTO EN LA CASETA POR 1$ "Throwing away any ten-dollar bills tonight?" "Who said you could dance with her - with-out asking me?" "Our friend has gone back to his booze again!" "- but I don't want you to drink!" "Please .... don't!" "You're Bull Weed's girl - aren't you?" ... ...of cheap music - booze - hate - lust - made a devil's carnival. "F-F-Feathershelected!" "You tell her now." "The committee is waiting to crown you Queen o' the Ball." "You needn't worry about your sweetie. He's out - - for the night!" "Before sentencing you, I declare to you and your kind... ...that no man, or band of men, can defeat the Law." "Others have tried it before, and, I regret to say, will try it again - - but their fate must be the same as yours." "All your life you have dealt with the Law as an enemy. And now... ...by a final deed of violence, you have compelled it to end your career." "I sentence you to hang by the neck until you are dead - -" "- and may God have mercy on your soul!" "How are we going to help him now?" "Don't worry. They haven't hanged him yet." The Law took no chances. Bull Weed was isolated from his world. No messages delivered, no visitors admitted. "- before sunrise tomorrow, to hang the said Bull Weed by the neck until he is dead." "Any last request?" "Tell Paloma to bring me the juiciest steak in Dreamland." "The only one who'll see Bull is Paloma - when he brings him his last meal." "Here's the plan - the hearse will come to the outer court... ...an hour before the hanging -" "- and you wait in your car at Three Corners Road, for Bull to join you." "You have Paloma tell Bull - I'll attend to the hearse." "Does that mean any danger - for you?" "The police will only see me buying two tickets at the railroad station -" "Then they'll be sure Bull is leaving town with me." "Then I won't see you again?" "This is good-bye." "If I lose you, it's my finish. I love you so -" "I can't let you go - !" "We have a chance to lead a decent life. If we get Bull out - we're his again!" "We can't double-cross him - - we owe him everything." "We do love each other, don't we?" BULL WEED SER? AHORCADO MA?ANA ES EL CASTIGO IMPUESTO POR SU CRIMEN MAT? AL HOMBRE QUE ATAC? A SU NOVIA "We can't do this - - we couldn't be happy if we betrayed him!" "You see - you taught me how to be decent." "Rolls Royce says watch for the hearse - two o'clock... ...The gang will be in it - - they'll cover the guards and spring you!" "That's a lie! Rolls Royce doesn't want me to get out!" "You've got him wrong, Bull - that hearse will come crashing through like a tank!" "On the level, Ed - has Rolls Royce or Feathers ever really tried to see me?" "Maybe I hadn't ought to tell you - but the whole town knows how they're carrying on." "Ed, is there time for another game of checkers?" "You hate to leave the old burg - don't you?" "Do you think Rolls Royce is still in town?" "What do you care? You'll be hanging in an hour." "There's one guy I'd like to get before I hang." "You're in a tight place now." "It's your move." "The plan went wrong - the guards got wise, somehow." "It's all over with him by now." "Extra! Bull Weed escapes!" "What's the extra about?" "Nothing - just a boob breaking jail!"

"We've got the Bull cornered at his old hangout!" "If you're waiting for Bull Weed, you'll have a long wait." "They'll get us both in a few minutes, Bull. Why should I lie to you now?" "If I could get my hands on that lousy skunk... ...I'd go back and let 'em hang me!" "I'm sorry things went wrong - but there's still time - for you - to get away!" "Now you see - - how much he double-crossed you!" "I've been all wrong, Feathers - I know it now - I've been wrong all the way -" "And all this got you was another hour!" "There was something I had to find out - - and that hour was worth more to me than my whole life." END
