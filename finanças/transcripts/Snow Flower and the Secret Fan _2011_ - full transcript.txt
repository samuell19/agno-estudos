Previously on Flower Crew. Special guests have come to visit. A never-ending transfer war has begun. I call Sae Ho to Muddy Road. (A bolt from the blue) The last transfer ticket is in Seung Yoon's hand. I'll use this gold transfer ticket. (Who will get the last transfer ticket?) (Jung Hwan transferred Sae Ho to Muddy Road house.) - Is he coming? - I hear someone coming. Sae Ho. (Welcome, my brother.) I'm just a random passerby. Is there someone named Ahn Jung Hwan here? (Feeling guilty) - I'm afraid that's me. - Is it you? I can't understand why I've been called. Actually, you're a victim. Jang Hoon doesn't like crowded places. - Okay. - That's why I called you here. You called me away from the hot springs to use me? I wanted to make Jang Hoon more uncomfortable. This is so far the most crowded house in Flower Crew history. Yes, it's the most crowded. Shall we sleep now? (Since he arrived, they want to go to bed.) From Flowery Road... Someone's been called. Seung Yoon... (Seung Yoon definitely wouldn't come here.) used a transfer ticket. Sae Ho. He didn't pick you. That was funny. I like these kinds of jokes. (Screaming) Why don't you go to the front and take a seat? (It's always unfair for him.) Seung Yoon is unbelievable. Jin Young. - You're not it. - Come here. Jin Young, come here. (Feeling frustrated) I don't know exactly who it will be, but I'm sure it's not Byung Jae. Why? Seung Yoon doesn't seem to like you. (He gives up hope.) You mean personally? Seung Yoon has called... (Then...) (who did Seung Yoon...) (invite to Flowery Road?) Byung Jae. - Yes! - Really? - Yes! - Really? Seriously? (Byung Jae transfers to Flowery Road.) Seriously? This doesn't make any sense. I decided to pick the most desperate person. I, Seung Yoon, invite Byung Jae to Flowery Road. (Seung Yoon waits for Byung Jae in front of the house.) (Feeling cheery) (Hi, Seung Yoon.) (Hi, Byung Jae.) What made you pick me? I picked you because you're so desperate. - Is that why you called me? - Welcome. - Thank you so much. - Welcome. (I will never forget your kindness.) This is the living room. (Welcome to Tonyeong's Flowery Road house.) - This is a good bed. - My goodness. Do you want to sleep with me here? Again, thank you so much, Seung Yoon. I mean it. (If it weren't for you, I would've slept at Muddy Road house.) This is the first time someone invited me to Flowery Road. I think people hate me. (He wants to be loved.) I haven't wronged anyone in a big way. What did the others say? Jang Hoon thinks... if you called me out of your own choice... it indicates a secret deal within YG. He said he would sue us. - We should be prepared for that. - Sure. (Don't worry, my brother.) (The people of Flowery Road take a selfie before going to bed.) (Looking handsome) Seung Yoon and Byung Jae will go to bed now. Goodnight. - Goodbye. - Goodnight. (Beaming smiles) (It's overcrowded.) (Meanwhile, the people of Muddy Road are busy setting their beds.) (Struggling) (Why don't you use scissors?) It worked. (They innovate by using tug-of-war to cut bubble wraps.) - In 1, 2. - Good. You two resemble Dumb and Dumber. Are you one of us, too? In 1, 2. (The bubble wrap became too ragged.) - There we go. - Goodness. (After splitting the bubble wrap...) - Ouch! - Oh, no. (He bumps his head.) Look! He's a fool. He's a fool. My goodness. Hey, you should join. (Is he a new member of the stupid club?) I'm glad to meet you. (Will Jin Young replace Byung Jae?) (Muddy Road members get ready to sleep.) (They raise their body temperature by brushing their teeth.) (They adjust to the cold by washing with cold water.) (It must feel frigid.) (I'll make sure to go to Flowery Road house tomorrow.) What are you doing? (Jung Hwan starts to act strange.) (Staring) What are you doing? It might get cold. - What? - In case it's cold. (He does everything he can to stay warm at night.) My goodness, he's so pathetic. (Approaching) (Brushing teeth) Don't brush your teeth next to me, it splatters everywhere. Shall we go near him? - Let's go. - Shall we? (The two walk towards Jang Hoon while splattering toothpaste.) I'll kick you. I'm going to kick you. (Cackling) (While everyone is busy washing up...) (Bumping) (The others continue to be clumsy in front of Jang Hoon.) There is no shortage of slapstick comedy. The frame is too low. Goodnight, Sung Jae and Dae Ho. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (It must be cold outside.) (Kissing) - Sleep well. - Goodnight. Sleep well. (Seven members spend their first night...) (at Muddy Road house.) My goodness. - My lower back hurts. - This is uncomfortable. Gosh, my lower back. - Goodnight. - Sleep well. (May you walk down Flowery Road tomorrow.) (Tongyeong, Naples of the east) (A picturesque morning arrives.) (Second day in Tongyeong) (Sung Jae is the first one to get up.) (It looks like he aged 10 years overnight.) (Sung Jae is worried for...) (Jang Hoon who sleeps on the bench.) (It must have been colder for Jang Hoon.) Were you cold? (Were you cold?) Your head must've been cold. (Sung Jae's warm gestures wake the others...) (one by one.) Gosh, it's refreshing. (Sae Ho washes his hair.) - You're like a big polar bear. - Why didn't you hug me at night? That's the disadvantage of sleeping bags. They separate us. (He loves Sae Ho.) Let me go. (As the eldest, Sung Jae's love for the others continue.) (He pours boiled water into a washing basin.) (What will he do with the water?) (Struggling) Jung Hwan. Wash your face. (Jung Hwan, wash your face.) Wash your face. (He's worries for Jung Hwan's skin.) I prepared warm water. - Go on. - I'll do it after breakfast. No, wash your face now. Come on. I don't even do that for my mother. Come on and wash up. The water is nice and warm. Thank you. It's nice and warm. (Jung Hwan gets up reluctantly.) It's time to get up. Okay? Hey, guys. (He wakes up the rest.) Wake up, Sae Ho. Wake up, Jin Young. It's 9am. (The seven Muddy Road members wake up.) (Suddenly) - Be careful with the luggage. - Where's the house? (Who is the woman approaching Muddy Road house with a red suitcase?) (Panting) Let's make it to Flowery Road today. I need to use the bathroom. I want to make it there. (Sae Ho heads to the front yard to do his business.) (Unfortunately, she arrives at the same time.) Oh, my. Wait a minute. Hello. You startled me. (It's the best way to welcome someone.) Hello. (Feeling flabbergasted) That startled me. (What just happened?) - My goodness. - What's wrong? (He makes a fuss to everyone's confusion.) Something big happened. (Why are you waking me up?) (Her appearance causes a commotion.) - Gosh. - Hello. Hello. Someone is coming. - Is everyone awake? - Jang Hoon, the person you wanted is here. - Really? - She arrived with a suitcase. - An idol member? - I don't recognize her. - She's here. - Hello. - Is it an idol singer? - I think so. She's young. Hello. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. - Hello. (Am I still dreaming?) Hello. (He regrets not having washed his face.) I want to say hello, but I don't recognize her. I haven't seen you in a long time. Thank you. (IU appears on Muddy Road.) It's IU. - Hello. - Hello. - You came so early. - Hello. (She doesn't belong at this shabby place.) May I shake hands with you? - It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. (Dae Ho finally recognizes IU.) I should have greeted her in a better way. (She is still in shock.) He looks so pathetic. Is someone there? - IU is here. - Say hello to IU. IU is here. (Stop lying.) Aren't you her fan? - Hello. - He's not awake. - I'm cold. - Say hello. Won't you say hello? (Flapping) (Give me back my blanket.) - She's visiting. - Goodness. (Muddy Road house intimidates her.) Why didn't you take her to Flowery Road? I asked her... which of the member she wants to see... the most. She said that it's one of you. (She chose someone here.) Who is it? (It's...) (IU's first meeting at 7am) (Tongyeong is still filled with autumn foliage.) Hello. - Hello. - Hello. (IU arrives in Tongyeong.) IU. You'll be going to 1 of 2 places. (It's time to decide her fate.) Among the members, who do you want to meet the most? A member I'd like to meet? (Thinking carefully) Will I end up wherever that person is located? That's right. I should make a careful selection. (This important decision will determine her trip.) I want to go to Flowery Road. (Contemplating) (Whom will IU choose?) Please send me to where Jung Hwan is. I watched Flower Crew a few times. (Why did she choose Jung Hwan?) He was almost always at Flowery Road house. (He was mostly on Flowery Road.) Flowery Road house seems very nice. I'd like to visit and see for myself. (But she ended up at Muddy Road house.) Who is it? I chose Jung Hwan. - Really? - Yes. (Me?) I knew you wouldn't choose me, but I was still hoping. Flash us a smile, Jung Hwan. I just woke up. (She didn't think he'd be on Muddy Road.) (What's all the fuss about?) He's finally getting up. Hello. She's really here? (He wants to hide.) Jang Hoon was waiting for you. Unfortunately, he's in the worst mood now. Please excuse my appearance. Hello. (He says hello.) (He wants to wash up first.) How long will you be here? - Until tomorrow? - Yes. Really? Jang Hoon should cook for you. You should sleep here tonight. (Will IU become a regular member of the show?) Be sure to impress her. She must have an incentive. - I'm sure about it. - Be good to her. Marshmallow (Acting cute) That song was released such a long time ago. (It was released in 2009.) Come on. - I like you - I like you - Goodness! - What should I do You should add, "Goodness!" (Transfer tickets excite them more than IU.) Since IU is here, - Yes? - your allowance will be adjusted. Is it 15 dollars? - Yes. - How dare you? Can you count? There's eight of us. - Do we have to cook? - Yes. Jung Hwan said he'd cook sujebi for us. Should I fetch some flour? I'll go with Dae Ho and IU. Also, I'll take Jin Young as well since he might feel awkward here. - Jin Young should just stay here. - Should he? I'll do that. I'll be back. - See you. - See you. (With 15 dollars, they go shopping to feed 8 people.) (Feeling worried) What can we buy with this? There's another way. 15 dollars will get us each a bowl of jjajangmyeon. - That'd be perfect. - I know. We could do whatever we want. (Are they trustworthy?) Just the three of us. Jjajangmyeon sounds good right now. Let's discuss it on the way. (How will they spend 15 dollars?) Do you see the nice house on the other side? - Yes, is that Flowery Road house? - That's... - Flowery Road house. - That's the one? - We took the boat yesterday. - That's beautiful. You should take a look just in case you don't end up there. I want to go there. - Really? - Yes. - You sound sure of yourself. - I really wanted to visit. (She's determined.) It looked so beautiful on TV. I wondered when I'd have a chance to visit a place like that again. (Team Flowery Road wakes up from the dream.) I think it'll be nice to cycle along the coast. That sounds great. (What awaits Byung Jae and Seung Yoon this morning?) We get to cycle along the sea. - Do you know how to ride a bike? - Of course. I learned to cycle really late. When did you learn to cycle? I think I was in middle school. (They cycle along the trail behind Flowery Road house.) - It's a really nice trail. - The view's really nice. - This must be a popular trail. - I know. (They enjoy the beauty of Tongyeong's sea.) It's lovely. - I think we can see Muddy Road. - We can see it. We can smell them. (They cycle while looking at Muddy Road house.) - It's lovely. - We can smell the sea. Morning sun is shining bright The sea is endless Let's run energetically While breathing clean air (How long will their bromance last?) What should we do now? - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Let's ask around. Let's ask how much the clams are. - We should buy them, right? - We should. Here's an octopus. (But they get distracted by the octopus right away.) Look at this. It's got really strong suckers. Goodness. - You're good at handling it. - I like these kind of things. I feel ticklish suddenly. She's good at handling it. - Thank you. - Thank you. She's good. Here are the Manila clams. - Hello. - Are these Manila clams? - Hello. - How much are the clams? Do you want to buy five dollars worth? How much would that be? (They get this much for five dollars.) - That's a lot. - That's a lot. - Can you give us some more? - We're cooking sujebi today. We can just add these to the broth, right? Wash it before cooking. Here you go. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Take care. Take care. We have some money left over because of the discount. - Should we get some gimbap? - Let's do that. (They hit it off really well.) - Which is... - This is 1 dollar and 50 cents... and this is 2 dollars. Did you say that's a dollar and 50 cents? Can you please give it to us for a dollar? (She stands firm.) Please give us a discount. Do you know the kimchi dance? Kimchi kimchi kimchi (He shows her the kimchi dance.) (Okay. I'll give you a discount!) - Yes! - It's a dollar. We need onions as well. A dollar. How much is that? Potatoes are a dollar. (We need to save as much money as we can.) She's giving us chili. - I gave you a discount. - Here are three dollars. We can eat gimbap with six dollars, right? - Thank you, ma'am! - You can eat one more roll. - We still... - Was it originally four dollars? - Yes. - Yes. - Did we get everything? - We did. - We did it. - It's a success. (They successfully accomplished their mission.) One serving of Chungmu gimbap costs four dollars. We can order one and half servings. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Have a seat. - After buying groceries... - We have about six dollars. - we have six dollars left. - Yes. - Is gimbap four dollars? - Yes. Can we order one and half servings? - I will give you two servings. - You will? - Thank you. - Please give us a lot. - Men and women all love... - It's here. - Goodness! - Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy. - Thank you. - Thank you. (IU is happy.) We are a team from this moment forward. - We are a team. - We became a team. If ever... Did you eat Chungmu gimbap? What? - You can't do that. - No! They'll find out. Did you eat Chungmu gimbap? - How can I? I don't have any money. - That's it. We only had 15 dollars to buy everything. Did you eat Chungmu gimbap by any chance? (IU tries it again.) (She fails.) IU can't lie. IU's in trouble. Don't eat it. I think you shouldn't eat it. - She can't lie. - Did you eat Chungmu gimbap? (Sae Ho tries to teach IU how to lie.) Why would I eat Chungmu gimbap? Your eyes are up too high. (They are very worried, but they eat anyway.) Let's just eat. - Let's do this! - For us to eat this! (While they are eating,) (Jung Hwan is tired from making the sujebi dough.) (He presses the dough.) I don't know if this is enough. (Jung Hwan, the master of sujebi.) (His secret is to knead the dough for a long time.) (Look as tired as you can so that the family will appreciate you.) (I am so tired.) (The dough is ready!) (He takes the dough and goes out to the yard.) Do you have to eat sujebi? Do you have to have sujebi? By the way, you are really good at cooking. (He sighs.) I don't like cooking. I know how much you like convenience store foods. - Can I try it? - What? - But the dough is ready. - Let me try it. - Let me feel the dough. - You can knead it. - Use this part of the palm. - I love the feel of the dough. I think we can make 500 pieces out of this. - There are eight of us. - Yes. Dae Ho and Jang Hoon eat a lot. (Jung Hwan moves along to feed eight people.) Wouldn't 500 pieces be enough? (By the way, this is harder than I thought.) This is done. The dough is ready. It was ready before you took over. (I was trying to take the credit.) Keep on kneading it. - What? - Keep going. Why? That way, it will be chewier. (I shouldn't have volunteered to do it.) (He plays with the dough.) This is energy consuming. - Do you want to try? - No, no. It's far. - We're back. - We're back. - You're so late. - Welcome back. Hello. We got everything you wanted, Jung Hwan. You can't buy this much with 15 dollars. What took you so long? (The time has come.) (Hang on a second.) What took you so long? - The market was far. - Was it? (They escape crisis, thanks to Dae Ho's acting.) - What did you buy? - Sae Ho, did you dance for them? - I didn't have to do it. - You have to cover the dough. (Jin Young and IU will be in charge of cleaning the vegetables.) (They wash the zucchini and spring onions in running water.) Jin Young, you're really good. - What's going on? - It's like he's peeling an apple. He surprised me. That's an advanced skill. - He's peeling well, isn't he? - Yes. That's not easy. I cook often at home. (Should I show them my skills?) (IU starts to chop the zucchini.) Jin Young, you're good. He's good. - Right. - Be careful with your thumb. IU, you were too busy with producing songs that you haven't really... used a knife that much, right? You're just like me. But she knows how to cook bulgogi. - Bulgogi. - Yes. Be careful with your hands. Be even more careful with potatoes. Wait. I think it will be better if I take over. - Wait. That's much better. - Like this? - No. Like this. - Put it on the flat surface. Cut it in half. (I feel nervous.) No. No. Let me do it. You can't do it. Let me do it. - Let me do it. - I'll do it. - I can lose a finger or two. - That's not true. - I mean it. - I will do it. It's okay with me. I don't have to make pinky promises. You have to play the guitar and other instruments. You can't lose your fingers. You can't get hurt. - Is it in? - Wait. I got it. (He adds Manila clams and vegetables in the boiling water.) - It's in. - Okay. (Now, they just have to wait for the dough to cook.) It's such a rare scene. It's a very rare scene. Since IU is here, should we do a three-octave singing contest? He wants to play a game again. The person who wins will... I should avoid being in the same team with Sung Jae. - I think it's a good idea. - Is that right? I love playing games. - Why don't we all play a game? - I love playing games. Sae Ho, you go first. I like You Goodness! I'm in my dream He's good. (He ends up screaming at the top of his lungs.) - That's it for me. - Good job. Good job. - You're good. - You don't go up at "you"? - I like you - Don't you start going up at "you"? Goodness! (It starts going up after "Goodness.") That's when the pitch starts going up. - I'm up next. - Okay. (It's Sung Jae's turn next.) Like you No, it's "I like you". (Why am I embarrassed?) (It turns into a singing class for elders.) (Did I get it wrong again?) - Start. - I like You - Goodness! - Goodness! (Audio meter) Higher. - He's so good. - One more time. Goodness! - He did well. - Didn't I do well? But it was slightly off-tune. - Wasn't my voice very clear? - It was very clear. - I - He can do it. (Even the major-leaguer is participating in the game.) Like you - Goodness! - Goodness! - "I'm in my dream". - I'm I'm in my dream He can do it. (Dae Ho tries his best.) (He did pretty well.) He can do it. The judge will make a fair selection. What does the winner get? He'll be sent to Flowery Road. Can you do that? I... - Can you send us to Flowery Road? - I'll sing it for you again. Sing it well this time. - She took something out just now. - She has something. Maybe we should try again. - Wait. - Can I try again? I have nothing separately prepared. The first place winner will receive this. Really? (A silver transfer ticket is the prize.) This never happened before. What did you say? How do the lyrics go? Are you giving me a transfer ticket right away? I got it. (The ticket can be awarded but not used personally.) Do you want to sing, too? Do you want to try now? (The older members join in late.) What's wrong with them? (They're all desperate.) Goodness. - Goodness! - I'm in my - Dream - Take it seriously. He sounds so delicate. Do it seriously. (High pitches reverberate throughout Muddy Road house.) (Are they all that desperate?) Objectively speaking, since he started this competition... and sang it the best, - I'd like to give it to Sung Jae. - Thank you. I'm not going to cook today. (Jung Hwan is furious.) Everyone, get your own food! Meet up at the parking lot later. I've been preparing for two hours. - IU, maybe... - Don't eat. you'll be having a hard time today. (What should I do?) - She used up all the tickets? - Right. Then you should leave. (You should leave, IU.) You're not busy, right? Go get some sleep, then. Go get some sleep. We don't care what you do. (As the three-octave contest ends, the sujebi is completed.) May I help you serve it? You can remain seated. - No. - Do you need to seem nice? Yes, I do. (Jang Hoon wants a nice image.) - Jin Young, take a seat. - That's all right. - Just sit. I'll do it for you. - Thank you. Basically, his usual self isn't like this at all. This is for... - This is for IU. - You can give it to her. - Thank you. - Here you go. - Thank you. - I thought this would be good. That looks good. (Is he scooping slowly on purpose?) Get a good shot of me, please. (Jang Hoon asks the cameraman to get a good angle.) Thank you for the food. - Thank you. - Thank you. Everyone has one, right? - My back hurts. - Enjoy. (He suddenly wanted to look good last minute.) - Help yourself. - Let me know if you want more. I'll make sure to get you more. It's so good. It's good. It's really delicious. (The broth is refreshing,) (and the dough pieces are chewy.) I think I kneaded the dough well. (Feeling dumbfounded) I'm not just saying this, but it's really good. Right? (Chef Ahn is Flower Crew's pride.) Hey, who on earth is IU? (Gosh) I feel like I've heard the name before. - Is that so? - Yes. I realized in a day... that you have to behave to survive. (Jin Young realized that he must behave to survive.) That's the rule. Look, sujebi is almost gone. It's really good. It's seriously perfect. (Meanwhile, Team Flowery Road heads to the contest zone.) You know what's good about Flowery Road? There are no hindering obstacles on the road. You're right. (They place their luggage in the trunk...) (and hop into the car.) (But why are they sitting in the backseat?) (What's going on?) Who's driving? - You don't have a license, right? - Yes. Who's going to drive? We were discussing that. - Is it far from here? - Is it far? It'll be about 4 to 5km. That means we'll get there around noon. That means we won't be able to eat. I'm sorry, but can you drive for us? We hopped into the backseat without thinking. (Eventually, a staff member helps them out.) (It's comfortable.) (I'll escort you safely.) - The water is... - We should try drinking it. - Right? - Tongyeong water is very famous. (Team Flowery Road arrives at the arranged location first.) What do we do now? I think they're here. (Team Muddy Road arrives.) - Hi, how are you? - Did you sleep well? - I did. - Have you eaten? Yes, I ate well. - Your sunglasses look cool. - Hey, there guys! - Byung Jae and Seung Yoon! - Good to see you. (IU securely hides behind Jang Hoon.) - Hey, come over here. - Hi, how are you? I was so surprised. Wait a minute. (Eyes popping) - Hello. - Hi, how are you? (She quietly arrived from Muddy Road.) Come over here. Why are you standing there? Now do you understand why I didn't join Flowery Road? It was Flowery Road for us. Aren't you cold, IU? The ocean breeze is cold. - It's kind of chilly. - Are you? - Here's my jacket. - Thank you. (If IU is cold, giving her a jacket is no big deal.) - This is warmer. - No, this is the warmest. - No. Mine is better. - No! - I'm 160cm tall. - No. This will fit you. - He said he's 160cm tall. - Let me see. It's too big for her. I wondered why he brought a jacket with him. - I brought it to give it to her. - He's being someone else. Here, just wrap it around. - I don't think she likes it. - Then you put this on, Jang Hoon. I'm okay. Since we moved the show to the weekends, - we became an all-star cast. - I know. On top of Sung Jae, Dae Ho, and Jin Young. Today, we have IU with us. Even IU is here for today's Flower Crew. 80 percent of oysters in the country... are produced in Tongyeong. This Poll of Fate... will be for Tongyeong's specialty, oysters. A top chef who graduated... from the prestigious Tsuji Culinary Institute... will cook for Team Flowery Road. - It's at Osaka, right? - I think so. That's a famous school. Team Muddy Road will receive... gloves and knives to shuck oysters... on their own. - We're shucking them? - Yes. - We need to work for them, right? - Right. Does Team Flowery Road only get to eat oysters? - You don't like oysters? - No, I can't eat them. I guess you have to switch teams. For this round of Battle of Fate, we'll play a speedy quiz game, Charades. (Speed Quiz, Charades) (Within 100 seconds, the member to get the least correct guesses...) (from IU will become Team Muddy Road's leader.) Aerobics. Pass. (The older members are not good at moving.) (So they keep passing.) (They can only stand still with their mouths gaping.) (Jang Hoon can't move at all.) Jang Hoon and Jung Hwan are Team Muddy Road's leaders. Now that you're divided into teams, you will have one final chance... to change your fate with a gold transfer ticket. (Who will become the owner of the gold transfer ticket?) (In Team Flowery Road's car,) (IU rolls her hair.) You're different, IU. You take good care of yourself. - What's going on there? - My bangs didn't look good. The camera is rolling. This scene might be included. - Is the camera on? - Yes. It was filmed. It's all right. (Dae Ho, the IU fan, smiles.) Welcome to Team Flowery Road. Let's enjoy whatever we can for now. Yes, that's a good idea. - We're heading for the cable cars. - Cable cars? Are we going on a date? (Hallyeosudo Cable Cars) (Enjoy Tongyeong, the Naples of the East) - All right, get in. - Get in. - Hurry and get in. - Be quick. Be careful. Two seats are perfect for me. I've been on this before. (The entire trip is 1,975m long and takes 10 minutes.) I get scared when it's higher than three stories. Honestly, I'm scared now. (Quivering) The height is tremendous. - It's amazing... - Imagine falling. that someone even managed to build this. We're almost there. (The cable car arrives after 10 minutes.) We've arrived. (But Team Flowery Road is unaware of the hardship ahead.) (Hundreds of stairs lie between them...) (and the Mount Mireuk observation deck.) (They begin to climb one step at a time.) This isn't Muddy Road, right? (Why does it feel like we're on Muddy Road?) Sae Ho, are we on Muddy Road? - That's what I'm saying. - I have no idea... why we have to go up like this. Hold on. We're not Team Muddy Road. Why must we climb these stairs? It's beautiful up there. Then please get the footage for us. Why is Team Flowery Road being lead up a difficult path? (They assure themselves that good things await above...) (and continue up the steep stairs.) - Should I hold your jacket? - I'm okay. (They pant and struggle,) (but 220m remain until they reach the top.) (Their steps are get heavier.) Are we there? We still have more to go. Let's go. (Korea's cleanup hitter climbs as he looks after the staff.) Reaching the top isn't easy. I know. It's like a lesson on life. We always run for the summit, but it's never easy to reach. (15 minutes of climbing is draining them of energy.) This path is flowery, yet muddy. (Finally, they can see the summit.) We're almost there. - We're almost there. - We're really close. (Team Flowery Road reaches the summit of Mount Mireuk.) (After sweating profusely,) (they finally see the magnificent scenery.) - This is why we're here. - It's incredible! Everyone, we need a picture altogether. (They look at the horizon where the sky and the sea...) (meets through a telescope.) I can see everything clearly. I can even see the sea. (This scenery can only be seen on top.) It's awesome. (Jin Young enjoys the view under the sunlight.) - Look at that. - What is it? - Look down there. - That? That's where the cruise is. That's the house. Is that Flowery Road house over there? Yes, it is. (The tough hiking is rewarded...) (with the beautiful scenery of Tongyeong.) I can smell the oysters. (Team Muddy Road is headed to shell oysters.) Shall we go in? (They enter the building where they'll shell oysters.) It's incredible. (Oysters are everywhere.) - There are so many oysters. - This is unbelievable. (The workers here manually shell 800kg of oysters from Tongyeong.) This is unbelievable. (He's completely shocked.) (As the largest oyster producing city,) (there are over 10,000 workers shelling oysters.) (They have to manually separate the flesh from the shells.) Ma'am, how am I supposed to shell the oysters? - Let me show you. - Like that? (Stick a knife between the shell and flip it over to remove the shell.) Okay. (Jung Hwan successfully shells an oyster...) (and puts it straight in his mouth.) You're supposed to knife it in deep. (Byung Jae also successfully shells an oyster.) - Like this? - Yes. Come on. - It's not easy to eat an oyster. - This is difficult. All of them are closed. - You should open the closed ones. - Am I the only one who can do it? This is a vast amount. (A mountain of oysters are in front of them.) (Something...) (beyond imagination...) (is coming!) Something is coming. (It's 800kg of fresh-caught oysters.) (It's a huge present for the members of Team Muddy Road.) Look at that. (It's unbelievable.) (Welcome. You've probably never seen this much of oysters before.) (He gives a deep sigh.) (An enormous amount of oysters are coming to the members.) Could we even finish shelling them all? Watch out. You might hurt yourself. Isn't this too much? I think they could reach this high. (Anxious) (Full-scale distribution of oysters.) (The oysters pour out endlessly.) (I can't stand this any longer.) (Sung Jae looks around and heads somewhere.) Seung Yoon, I need to talk to you. Okay. (He takes Seung Yoon to a quiet place.) - I... - Yes. I can't stand the smell of oysters. - I don't think I can do this. - Is it too much for you? I want to transfer. You have a transfer ticket? I want to ride the cable car. (Sung Jae hands over the silver transfer ticket to Seung Yoon.) - This is for you. - Thank you. (He received a silver transfer ticket from IU.) So you want me to send you to Flower Road, right? Yes, please. - I really can't stand it here. - Okay. - Seung Yoon. - Yes. - I believe in you. - Let's do a little more work first. (I believe in Seung Yoon.) (He suddenly changes.) - Where have you been? - I was at the bathroom. This ticket is troublesome. It makes you swayed. Holding this makes me feel like I have the power. (Is he going to keep his word?) - Just now, - Yes. - someone used a transfer ticket. - What? Really? Why would they use that? One of them used the ticket. Does IU have to go? Seung Yoon... (Seung Yoon...) (had...) (a transfer ticket?) used a transfer ticket. Did he pick another one? It must be him coming here. (Whom did Seung Yoon send?) He sent Sung Jae to Flowery Road. (He sent Sung Jae to Flowery Road.) - Really? - I told you. (Surprised) - Seung Yoon is cool. - He is indeed. I'll send Sung Jae to Flowery Road. (Seung Yoon stuck to the deal.) Sung Jae has been in Muddy Road house... the whole day yesterday. He hasn't seen Flowery Road house. (Sung Jae learns that he'll be sent to Flowery Road.) You can go to Flowery Road. (Seung Yoon, you kept your word.) Sung Jae will transfer to Flowery Road. (He will go to Flowery Road.) - Did someone use the ticket for me? - Is he going to Flowery Road? What did you say? - Thank you. - Who sent him? Seung Yoon used the ticket. - Where is he? - What? - Seung Yoon, what have you done? - I'll get going. Thank you. You didn't betray me. - Jung Hwan. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Seriously, he has never been to Flowery Road yesterday. I'll go ride the cable car. See you. - Sung Jae, take a good rest... - Thank you. and come back before you go to sleep. I'll get going. - Come back at night. - Okay. (He's so happy he can't hear anything.) I don't care. I'm not interested anymore. - Aren't you tired? - Yes. (He unaware what lays ahead.) I'm so happy to be out. I should go take the cable car. I should get going. Shall we share the information about transfer tickets? - Let's be open. - In order... to design a strategy, (Hesitant) we should be honest to each other. I don't mind. I don't have any tickets. - Let me see. - Here you are. - I don't have any. - I see. Do we share everything? - If we share the information, - If we do that, - we can avoid conflicts. - Yes, we should be careful. Why do we have to share? - Do you have the ticket? - Hang on. That's enough. You don't need to say more. - You don't need to show us. - I got it. Do you want to show us or not? - Let's share what we have. - Sounds good. - Good. - Let's do it. - I'll start. - Okay. (They reveal the tickets.) (The men don't have the real tickets.) - I don't have anything. - Me, too. - What's that? - What's that? (Something dropped on the ground.) - She has one. - Did you get one? - She has it. - Did you get one? - I got one. - Really? How did you get it? - I just picked one. - She was just lucky. (From the Poll of Fate,) (she picked the gold transfer ticket.) - You picked it. - It got picked by me. - This is amazing. - It's amazing. - We'll keep it a secret. - This is really similar to Go-Stop. Having good cards doesn't mean you'll win. - Of course. - You need to be clever to win. It's about teamwork. - She's the master of the game. - Yes, she is. - She has already mastered the game. - She sure has. I'll pretend... - that I have a ticket. - Okay. May I borrow it? - May I borrow it? - No. - Good job. - I got what you mean. Good job. - If you gave me the ticket... - If she did, - you were going to betray her. - No, if she gave it to me, I was going to say she's not supposed to do that. (While they are busy training IU,) (Sung Jae is climbing the mountain.) I thought the cable car would take me... right next to the observatory. Why are there... so many stairs? (He's out of Muddy Road, but Flowery Road is also tough.) (Sung Jae is the unluckiest guy in the world.) I feel so refreshed and satisfied. Let's enjoy... (He was excited to see Hallyeohaesang National Park.) Hallyeohaesang National Park. I'll introduce the scenery to you once I'm up there. This amazing view of the Aegean Sea. There are more stairs. (He doesn't have the energy to enjoy the view.) (How much more does he have to climb?) Hello. How long until I reach the top? - You're almost there. - Really? - You can make it. - Thank you. I wish you a safe trip back. (He's about to reach the top of Mount Mireuk.) (It was a long way to Flowery Road.) What an amazing view. (It's been a tough journey.) - He's here. - He's here. Sung Jae! (Guys, I'm dying.) This is Muddy Road. He's holding a selfie stick. Why is Flowery Road so tough? We asked ourselves the same question hundreds of times. This is the last staircase. This is too tough to be Flowery Road. (The glorious moment of reaching the summit of Flowery Road.) I think we should go down now. - We don't have enough time. - Hang on. Let me see the scenery. - The chef... - Just one minute. - Hang on. - The chef is waiting for us. Hang on. Just one minute. (He only has 1 minute to enjoy the view.) In 1, 2, 3. (He takes a picture while gasping.) Okay. Let's go. (Okay. Let's go.) Let's go. (He's in vain.) - Let's go. The chef waits for us. - Let's go. Congratulations. He looks happy, though. I made the best out of... the transfer ticket I got from IU. Thank you so much. What a workout in the morning. It's going to set an edge on our appetite. I'm already hungry. The bread is gone from my stomach. - We're on a boat... - Yes. - by the dockside. - This is nice. (They enjoy grilled oysters in Tongyeong.) Let's get rid of the moisture. Yes, you should do that. (Something pops.) It has begun. - Are they going to pop? - Yes. (Something pops again.) (It's not easy to live as Muddy Road members.) My gosh. It's cooked well. (They open one of the grilled oysters.) - Look at this. - Hang on. (It looks delicious.) Seung Yoon, this is for you. (Seung Yoon tries the oyster first.) How is it? - Is it tasty? - Does it taste good? - Byung Jae. - You eat first. I'm fine. Here you go. Oh, my. (I got you.) (Jung Hwan and Byung Jae are like comedians.) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Byung Jae. I didn't mean to do that. It was an accident. Your mustache is red. (The man with red mustache coughs.) It's tasty. - Drop the oysters. - Do we have some more? (It's the main dish, oyster ramyun.) (The noodle looks chewy.) It looks good. It looks so tasty. (Oyster ramyun is the best meal for those who are in Muddy Road.) - Here you are. - Thank you. (Let's eat.) (Let me taste the oysters.) (The broth tastes of oysters.) (It makes an amazing combination with the chewy noodles.) (It warms and rejuvenates their weary bodies.) Isn't it even better because we shucked the oysters ourselves? - It's much tastier. - Right? (They have nothing to envy Team Flowery Road for.) I'm so expectant. (While Dae Ho temporarily leaves for another schedule,) (Team Flowery Road heads to Flowery Road house.) (They head to try the delicacies prepared by a top chef.) - Hello. - Hello. (Chef Jung Ho Young) (As a Tsuji Culinary Institute graduate,) (Chef Jung Ho Young is a Japanese cuisine expert.) (What culinary wonders will be prepared for Team Flowery Road?) Tongyeong is famous for oysters. - So I prepared 3 oyster dishes. - 3 kinds? Perhaps your cooking will be able to help covert... a non-oyster eater to enjoy oysters. - That would mean he's amazing. - Right. - I will do my best. - I'm looking forward to it. Most of you probably haven't tried this first dish. - I'm making oyster dumplings. - Really? - Oyster dumplings? - Yes. I've never heard of oyster dumplings. This is amazing. Last time I was in Team Flowery Road, I got to try professional Chinese food. Doesn't this feel different eating like this? (IU the oyster lover is excited.) First, the filling is lightly seasoned. (A salt water rinse can make oysters salty.) The oysters go in whole. I thought he'd mince them. - Do you like oysters? - Yes, I love oysters. He looks worried. - You like oysters, too, right? - Yes, I love oysters. (Fry one side of the dumplings in a heated pan.) (The soft and crunchy harmony is nice.) - While we wait for him to cook... - Let's play a game. - Let's make an acrostic poem. - Yes, about Tongyeong. Why not just go with "IU"? - Let's do that. - Okay. - I. - When I see IU, - E. - I'm reminded of this song. - U. - You don't have to cry Don't cry (His vibrato is almost as good as IU's.) (Sae Ho, the unknown singer who released two albums,) (is going mad with his singing.) He's... (But he succeeded in making IU happy.) That's enough. - You sing really well. - I... - like singing. - Your voice trembles. I can sing again. - Do one more, then. - Should I? When I see IU, - E. - I'm reminded of this song. - U. - You are my lady (Belting) (It's a horrible example of the technique.) - We should stop. - That's the song. - I got one, too. - You do? - I. - I am IU. - E. - I want to sing this song. "I want to sing this song." - U. - Hit song, hit song, exciting song - This is fun. - That's good. That's a good one. That was a good one. - The dumplings are ready. - Really? (The one and only oyster dumplings are done.) They look delicious. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. I haven't had an oyster since I was young. (Give it a try, Sung Jae!) (Hesitating) (He tries oyster for the first time in 40 years.) - You look uncomfortable. - No. By the way, it doesn't have that fishy oyster aroma. - It's because of the chives. - Is that right? - The chives compliment the taste. - I see. It's good. I think they're different from other oyster dishes. (Juices drip as soon as a bite is taken.) (He closes his eyes and savors the fresh oyster taste.) (Oyster lover IU takes a bite.) (She slurps the whole oyster.) (Savoring) - This is so good. - It's great. - It's good. - How is it? It's not the taste I expected. It's really delicious. - It's really delicious. - The juices... from the oyster blanket the mouth with splendid warmth. I've never had anything like this. - It's amazing. - It's really delicious. It's really delicious. I thought he'd make at least 10 dumplings. - There are other dishes, too. - Do you have other dishes? Next are fried oysters. - Fried oysters? - Fried oysters. (Battered oysters are dropped into hot oil.) (Chef Jung's Tip: Making perfect fried oysters) (Dry the oysters before coating them and fry them until golden.) Jin Young, who would you like to share this meal with? - My fellow members. - Your fellow members? - How about you, IU? - I... want to share it with Yoo In Na. (She wants to share with her best friend.) Does In Na know that you're here? - Yes, I just texted her. - Really? I told her that I'm having so much fun. - Can you... - Should I call her? - Go ahead. - Let's see what she's up to. Hello? Hello? (Oh, this is on-air.) Yes, hello. - We're shooting for Flower Crew. - I see. Yes, I read an article about it. - Applause! - Yes! (She reads articles about her best friend.) Sung Jae is also here. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - It's nice to meet you. Yes, likewise. You didn't just wake up, did you? (Sung Jae's dad-like joke cracks them up.) I am sorry. It's nice meeting you. Why are you two so close? I don't know. We haven't had the chance to showcase our friendship. - Let's come here together. - Then... Just once as a guest? Yes, I'm here as a guest today, too. Please make IU a regular member. We'd love that. - We'd welcome her with open arms. - Thank you. IU will be here overnight today. Should she sleep at Flowery Road house or Muddy Road house? No matter where she is, she sleeps well. But do they really sleep on a muddy road? (Take it easy, In Na.) It's almost like sleeping on a street. We can't let a national sweetheart sleep on a street. Wherever you sleep, have a good time. - Okay, I will. - In Na. - Bye. - See you next time. Okay. Thank you. - Bye. Thank you. - Thank you, In Na. She's witty. The second dish is ready. (The most crunchy fried oysters are ready.) - That was quick. - He's really fast. (Very crunchy) (Oyster lover Jin Young is busy eating.) It's really delicious. It's different again. It tastes like oyster, but it's totally different. The outside is really crunchy, but the inside is almost creamy. The contrast is unbelievable. Aren't you glad you joined Team Flowery Road? I belonged here from the start. It's delicious. (Thanks to Chef Jung, they enjoyed dinner.) (What will happen to them next?) It's time to decide who will join which team. For this Battle of Fate, you will suggest one game you can play confidently. Among eight games, we will pick one. That game will decide your fate. The winner of that game will become Team Flowery Road's leader. (Feeling excited) - Muddy Road is full today. - There are five people. If by any chance IU joins Team Muddy Road, - We can't even imagine... - we need to give her a room. You don't have to do that. There's another solution. We can all sleep inside while she sleeps outside. - But that's too harsh. - You're a bad guy. That's too harsh, so we need to give her a room. - Now, please write down... - What should I write? a game you're good at for submission. (They must be sure of victory.) If IU decides to sing, we're all done for. (Their fate depends on this one game!) - That's right. - Is everyone finished? - Yes, I'm done. - I'm not done yet. - We'll start from Sae Ho. - Let's go from left to right. I wrote "jegichagi". - "Jegichagi". - Yes. It's the game I'm quite confident in. When I was in school, people called me "Cho Jegi". - Cho Jegi. - My friends called me that. I wrote "sustaining a sound with one breath". (I can do that well, too.) You did it like this, right? Since we're at a baseball field, I chose "throwing your shoe furthest". - Jung Hwan has the advantage. - What about Jung Hwan? You have to throw it. - With your hand? - With your hand? But Jang Hoon's here. It's different from a basketball. I wrote "initial sound game". - "Initial sound game". - I was going to do that. - It's hard. - It's fun. I am sorry. What is it? "Basketball lifting". (Objections explode.) - I changed the ball. - That's unfair. Do you know what Byung Jae called you? He said you're a gangster. - That's crazy. - All right. It's my turn. I changed the ball at least. "Eating ice cream fast". - In this weather? - Yes. It's exactly why I suggested it. Byung Jae, you're up. Mine says, "eating a snack on your forehead". I wrote... "spinning a book for a long time". With your finger. That's really hard. All the games are tough. This Battle of Fate will decide... where you spend your last night in Tongyeong. Team Muddy Road will sleep in the house you slept last night. Team Flowery Road... will be escorted home. - No way. - No way. - This is it. - We get to go home tonight? We will give you a ride home. - Tonight? - We're going home again. - This is it. - Can we go home, then? We get to go home. - To our homes in Seoul. - Really? But doesn't it take a while to get there? Are we taking a bus together? I'm so dumb, I forgot about the transfer tickets. I was victimized last week, but I forgot all about it. I traveled for two hours and returned back here. - So... - That's crazy. - I traveled full two hours. - Tongyeong is even further. If you get the call at 1am, you'll get back here at 5am. (It's just got more difficult.) "Basketball lifting" would be horrible. Please don't. (Everyone's fate depends on this moment!) - He chose one. - I think that's mine. - It had been drawn. - I can't tell what it is. Here's the game that will determine your fate. It's jegichagi. (Jegichagi) (Some are happy, others are not.) - He's the most prepared. - Are you good at jegichagi? Hey, I'm good at anything that involves kicking. Sae Ho, please send me a secret mission with a text message. It would be horrible to sleep outside today. Can you sleep outside? - At Muddy Road house? - Yes. I'm going to Flowery Road. You should just agree. Can you play jegichagi? I'll try my best. (She knows going to Flowery Road is the only way.) We received the secret mission from Sae Ho. Let's get ready to play jegichagi. Should I keep my foot lifted? This is how you play. Make sure the it hits this part of the foot. (She practices with a heating pad.) (It's not easy to kick even once.) (She's only determined to go to Flowery Road.) If I can't do it, I should at least look cute. IU seems very determined. She wants to go to Flowery Road. (She's fully determined.) Who would like to go first? - I'll go first. - Okay. Here I go. (How well will Seung Yoon play?) Start. - That's 1, 2. - That's 1, 2. (He only kicks twice.) What happened? (Goodness) (IU is still practicing.) Doesn't it seem futile? I'll be heading right to Muddy Road house. What about Seung Yoon? (Is he a possible candidate for Sae Ho's secret mission?) Who wants to go next? Jin Young, please start. Hold on, I'm so nervous. It's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, - 8, 9, 10. - What's going on with him? That was great. Good job. You got 10. It's 5, 6. (He lifts his knee.) (He kicks with all parts of his leg.) (What's going on?) - I got 10. - He kicked 10. What if I can't get 10? - Jin Young is good at everything. - Who's next? - 10? - I'll start. (Byung Jae is next.) Here I go. (Byung Jae is competent at everything.) (Will he also play jegichagi well?) Goodness. (It turns out he's not so good.) (His score is the same as mine.) (The others are happy that he got unlucky.) - My goodness. - I'm sorry, Byung Jae. - That's 1, 2, 3, 4. - It's 1, 2, 3, 4. (Jang Hoon places second.) (Sung Jae places third.) - That's 2, 3. - He got 3. I told you that no one is that good. - Is IU next? - There's a mission, so it might be okay not to score so high. (Unzipping) (She takes off her coat to get ready.) - I don't think that's necessary... - Don't drop it. - Lift your leg as high as possible. - You might catch a cold. - She must be cold. - Get ready. (She must try her best.) (She warms up a little.) Good luck. - One. - She kicked twice. - She scored two. - Good job. (IU kicks twice.) (The others congratulate her.) All the members and staff members applauded her. I'm nervous, too. My pants are too tight. My pants are too tight for jegichagi. Stop pulling them up more. Here I go. One try, right? - I think he'll be good. - That's 1, 2, 3, 4. (He holds a stable position.) - That's 6, 7, 8, 9. - It's 6, 7, 8, 9. (Oh, my goodness.) Jin Young still places first. (Sae Ho places second.) What happened? (He's never the best no matter what he does.) (Only one member remains.) With a score of 10, Jin Young is in first place. I underestimated it. (You must stay alert.) If Jung Hwan kicks more than 10, he'll lead Team Flowery Road. - If he kicks less than 10... - That would be so embarrassing. (He's unrivaled when it comes to kicking games.) - Here I go. - I bet he'll do very well. (Will he be able to kick more than 10 times?) It's 1, 2... (He's more stable than anyone else.) (He's good at kicking as expected.) (However, he started to stumble.) That's 9, 10, and 11. (Jung Hwan kicks 11 times.) (I could have won.) (Their fates switch with such a small difference.) (I'm going home.) I almost didn't make the last one. (He's frustrated.) Jung Hwan is the leader of Team Flowery Road. The mission isn't for the highest scorer, right? Here's Sae Ho's secret mission. (Fate is subject to change.) (What is Sae Ho's secret mission?) It's for the person who scored seventh place. (The person who places 7th) It's Seung Yoon and I. - One more. - IU as well. IU, too. Seung Yoon, Sung Jae, and IU cleared the secret mission. (They're the ones who scored the least.) Since all three of them kicked twice, we'll select one more game... to decide who goes to Flowery Road. - Okay. - Here's the game... that will determine who goes to Flowery Road. (Which game will they play?) (Whether they go home or not depends on it.) - It's basketball lifting. - That is just horrible. (Basketball lifting) Jung Hwan wrote it. Why did you pick mine? - I'm good at it. - How do you play? Let's start with Byung Jae. (Byung Jae is up first.) Here I go. (Byung Jae scored eight last time.) (How many will he score this time?) (Is he playing jegichagi?) That's three. (He ends up scoring three.) (He still did his best.) That wasn't so bad. Byung Jae really wants to go home. Next up is our special guest. She's taking off her coat again. - It's not necessary. - It's heavy. Do I kick the ball with my knee? - You can use any part of your body. - Any way you want. - No hands, right? - No, that's not possible. - However you want. - I've never played this. You can use your head. - Use this part of the leg. - Use the knee. - The knee is the best. - That's right. - You can do it. - I can do it. Good luck, IU. - You can do it, IU. - I got this. Here I go. (Why is she so nervous?) That's 1 and 2. Goodness! (Her second kick went too far.) (It went to the staff members.) I'm so sorry. Oh, no. (Why is everyone clapping for her?) Why are you aiming at the production staff? Did anyone get hit? One. (The ball that IU kicked) (She didn't intend to hit anyone.) Goodness, did anyone get hit? At least she scored two. That's still impressive. I thought she'd only score one. You can go to Flowery Road if you score four. - You can do it. - Here I go. (He goes to Flowery Road if he scores four.) That's 1, 2. And 3 and 4. - That's four! Gosh. - What happened? (Seung Yoon scores 4.) He's going to Flowery Road. Thank you, thank you. Please select two members who will accompany you home. I'd like to discuss with Seung Yoon. - Go ahead. - We should select the ones... who won't disadvantage us. No, I have an idea. - Okay. - Just trust me. - I have a plan. - Okay. We made our decision. (Which members will Jung Hwan select?) - Byung Jae. - Yes? I'd like to select the second person to your left. - Me? - Yes. - Really? - You had a hard time yesterday. You should get home. I'm taking Sung Jae to Flowery Road because... if he stays behind, he'll exhaust everyone by making them play games. Is it for the others' sake? It's for the others. It doesn't matter. This is my opinion. I don't think this person should stay behind. I'd like to take IU. (IU goes to Flowery Road.) I like and respect her. - We will escort you home. - Really? Yes. - Please come. - Really? Yes, that's right. Thank you. She's going. Is this really happening? Here's your last chance to change your fate. It's time to pick the gold transfer ticket. Only 1 out of 9 is real. Let's see. (Jin Young takes his pick.) (Unfortunately, it's fake.) (Jang Hoon picks a fake.) I haven't checked it yet. (It's a fake anyway.) (It's fake again.) I'm choosing Dae Ho's. I'll put it in my left pocket. I, Lee Dae Ho, give Cho Sae Ho the permission... to pick my gold transfer ticket on my behalf. It's signed on Nov 15, 2016. (What did Sae Ho pick on Dae Ho's behalf?) (It's the real gold transfer ticket.) (Everyone else on Team Flowery Road picks a fake.) (What result awaits Dae Ho?) (It's time to get off work at 9pm.) (Team Flowery Road heads to Seoul.) We must plan carefully. (Their plans regarding transfer tickets are key.) Did you use up your silver transfer tickets? - Silver. - Did you use them all? How many did you receive? - Just one. - You only received one? No, two. (She confesses.) Did you receive two? You received two? You're so scary. (Do you have 2 instead of 1?) Are you giving me this right now? (Today morning, before she meets the others,) (the staff gave her two silver transfer tickets.) We usually only give one to the guest. - Are you giving me two? - Yes. This would be a twist to the members, then. - That's right. - I see. This isn't normal. (How will she use the two silver tickets?) Good to know. I'm quite sensitive about this... because I turned back from Flowery Road before. - Right. - I'm sure Team Muddy Road is... He's right. planning to take us to their team whatsoever. They don't try to transfer to our team... because they're all furious. That's true. You gave one ticket to Sung Jae, right? - Yes. - But you have another one? I used it, too. - You did? - When? - Who did you give it to? - I can't tell you. It's okay now. (He investigates her.) Did you give it to someone in our team? (Do Team Flowery Road have an enemy within?) No. I didn't give it to anyone here. But you know... I made sure... (Does their fate lie on Muddy Road?) I made sure it wouldn't hurt anyone here. This isn't happening. I found out a way to make this team safe. - If someone says to you, - Yes. (He teaches IU the system of Flower Crew.) they'll do as you ask... in front of you, but you should know... it doesn't help you at all. Especially, the man who is 2m tall, (Members on blacklist) the one that does the kimchi dance, and Byung Jae who is a shrewd con. Actually I... (Who did she give it to?) gave it to Sae Ho. (Why did it have to be Sae Ho?) - Goodness! - Please listen to me carefully. (We're ruined.) I feel anxious. - But... - I feel anxious. - he promised me... - I guess it was in the afternoon. he wouldn't make us fight each other and end it peacefully. Sae Ho, there's something you don't know. Really? Something I don't know? (She made a peace treaty with Sae Ho.) I have two silver transfer tickets. (IU looks at the big picture.) - Sae Ho, please... - Okay. (She wants a peaceful ending.) - Don't fight because of it. - I'll use it well. - Be a good man. - That gives me some pressure but... - There's no peace in here. - Never. IU is too nice. - That evil tries to... - She is too nice so... (The Evil Sae Ho has the key to all after all.) Who's calling? (A call from Team Flowery Road.) Jung Hwan called me. We just left. - You did? - Yes. Sung Jae is sound asleep. - Is he sleeping? - He must be tired. I don't think he should be sleeping now. Why is it? If he sleeps now, he can't fall asleep easily later. Am I right? Right. It's cold over there. - Sae Ho. - Yes, Seung Yoon. I heard you got it from IU. (What? How did he find out?) (Sae Ho hangs up right away.) (He must be baffled.) (He has been hiding it, but it's revealed by a call.) I'm sure Sae Ho never told anyone in his team. - I know. - See? I told you. Why didn't you trust me? (Sae Ho runs away after the unexpected call.) (What's going on with him?) That's what it is. Why was the call hung up? Can we give the gold ticket to someone else? - What? - We can, right? No, we can't. (All the members are planning the next move in silence.) (Will the transfer ticket be used peacefully as IU wished?) - Listen, IU. - You should've kept it. I'm sure Sae Ho will call you back... to Muddy Road. That's just low. (Jung Hwan thinks Sae Ho will call IU back to Muddy Road.) If he does, he must be bad. It's the first time she said anything negative. (As the situation doesn't seem to go well, she feels anxious.) This is the first for her. - She said he is bad. - She said so. But why... Why do you think he's going to call over? You fell for his trick. I don't believe it. (The ticket is out of her hands now.) Are we approaching the highway? - That's right. - Goodness. What do we do now? Sae Ho should've called her... before we entered the highway. We're passing Tongyeong toll gate now. (She feels anxious and starts being doubtful.) (Will the peace treaty kept until the end as she wished?) (In front of Muddy Road house at 9:30pm) (Dae Ho comes back to Muddy Road where Sae Ho is.) Well, it's colder than yesterday. (The air feels like Muddy Road house already.) (As he enters Muddy Road house, he feels weaker and weaker.) You're back. Hi. (He feels strange even with warm welcoming.) Gosh. Why are you still here? - What? - Why are you here? - Eat some. - Come over here. We got a lot. Why is Jin Young here? - Things turned out this way. - That's right. You know what? (When I was coming up here...) It felt like home. I changed my mind. (He's born to be Team Muddy Road.) After I stayed a day here, I realized that it's comfortable even if it's tough here. That's right. There's nothing to lose now. No one knows what's going to happen in Team Flowery Road. (Muddy Road is more comfortable than Flowery Road.) I guess they know that... we would call them over, right? How many transfer tickets do we have now? (Dae Ho checks the tickets first.) Please tell us quickly. - Who you'll give it to... - Oh, that thing? I picked the transfer ticket for Dae Ho. I'll give him what I picked earlier. (Sae Ho gives Dae Ho the transfer ticket he picked.) Let me see it. (He checks it first...) (and smiles.) Did you really pick this for me? This letter is from Dae Ho. I'll put it in my left pocket. (Sae Ho picked one with the letter of attorney for Dae Ho.) (He got the real one when he picked it instead of Dae Ho.) To be honest with you, IU has the gold transfer ticket. - What? - If she has that one... Even if she has that ticket, we still have another one. (We got another one.) Let me explain it to you. I received a silver transfer ticket as a guest, - and I gave it to Jang Hoon. - Yes. He gave it to me. (Jin Young gave his guest ticket to Jang Hoon?) (Today morning, when they were cooking sujebi,) (Jin Young sneaked out as the staff members called him.) - Here you go. - Thank you. (Jin Young received the silver transfer ticket secretly.) - This is a guest transfer ticket. - Okay. You can't use it for yourself, but you can give it to someone. I'll give my silver transfer ticket... (He gave it to Jang Hoon before Dae Ho arrived.) to Jang Hoon. (Jang Hoon has a silver transfer ticket.) And now I'll give him... what I picked to earlier. (Dae Ho has a gold transfer ticket.) (Sae Ho has a silver transfer ticket.) (IU has a gold transfer ticket.) (Who will be called over by these four transfer tickets?) (It's 10pm, an hour past since they left.) (The lights turn on. Is this a sign something bad is going to happen?) What's wrong? - Why did you turn on the lights? - What's going on? (They feel something bad will happen.) Gosh. Wake up. (They arrive at the rest area.) - Why did you turn on the lights? - What's going on? I got the news at the rest area before. (Jung Hwan recalls his sad memories.) Gosh. Whenever I come to the rest area, I feel anxious. It's cold. (The door is opening ominously as well.) - Everyone, please get off. - All four of us? - Okay. - All right. - Sure. It's okay... - Okay. I'll get off as you said. to get off, but it would be better if I can get back in the car. (Anxious) Did someone call us? Yes. Someone in Muddy Road used the transfer ticket. (One of the three were used.) - It's killing me. - Okay. So what? One of you will... (It'll take an hour to go back to Muddy Road.) (Who would be the one that goes back to Muddy Road?) But to be honest with you, (Five minutes ago) since I have a gold transfer ticket, and I decided to stay here anyway, it would be good if we can invite as many as possible and have fun. Let's have a party today. - In any case... - We'll go home tomorrow anyway... - so let's have... - I can go somewhere else, - but they can only call others. - We have three tickets. I'll play the villain this time. (Now the door for transferring opens up!) I'm really sorry. - He looks so cool somehow. - That's right. I'll start first. I will... (Dae Ho uses his gold transfer ticket.) He's using it. I will... (Who is he going to call over?) (He takes a moment for a surprise.) - Hey, Dae Ho. - I'll call IU. (Dae Ho calls IU over to Muddy Road.) (He's awesome!) Dae Ho the big boy! I acted like a big boy, right? (He did a great job like a big boy.) - All right. - It was a big hit. The one... Dae Ho called over to Muddy Road is... IU! (IU transfers to Muddy Road.) Dae Ho called her over? - Dae Ho did? - It's unbelievable. (She's baffled as this is her first time transferring.) - Really? - Are you serious? I told you don't trust anyone here. I never thought Dae Ho would do this to me. (She never expected this would happen.) Gosh. I just... (Now I understand how things are here.) What are you going to do now? Are you going to use your gold ticket... or go back to join them? But even if I use my ticket, they can call me back. No one knows yet. Why don't you tell them you're not going? (It's a pity that she can't even use the ticket she has.) Go ahead. Hi, Jung Hwan. Where are you now? - Are you back, Dae Ho? - Yes. Where are you? First of all, thanks for not calling me. Sure. - Someone wants to talk to you. - Okay. (It's me, Dae Ho.) It's IU! (He turns into IU's fan right away.) You look pretty. Dae Ho, what happened? We were supposed to meet at Flowery Road. There's no Flowery Road today. - That's why you invited me? - Because... I wanted you to come here, so we can see your face. You could have come to Flowery Road instead. - That didn't cross my mind. - I... (He's lying.) That didn't cross my mind. (He's acting.) You should have told me earlier. You should have said so earlier. I didn't know. It's my first time here. I'm really sorry. Let's talk when you're here. I miss you. Come quick. Bye. Hang up. I feel sorry. Where's Sung Jae? - Hey. - Get ready, Sung Jae. Make up your mind. If you're going to send me, send me. I'm tired. Make up your mind soon. - Let's get going. - Okay. Let's get in the car. Wait. I'm cold. Then get in and put your head out the window. I'll let you pass with that. He feels cold... because he's old. We need to be considerate. We'll open the window like this. - It's cold. - What do you want to do? I'll just... - I'll just... - Take it with you. - Okay. I'll take it with me. - Keep it safely, then use it as you wish. (They escort her to the car as they feel sorry for her.) Thank you. I think we'll probably meet later. Even if it's not me that calls you. We're nice people. All right. - Goodbye. - Have a safe trip. Goodbye. (There's 59km left until Muddy Road. They're expected to arrive at 11pm.) Does it take an hour from here? (She returns with a heavy heart.) Why did Sae Ho do this to me? We had a great time together. We had good food on Flowery Road. See this? (A hairpin?) This. I'm chained because of this. I was deeply moved because of this earlier on. - Here. - Wait a minute. - Wait. - Okay. (Sae Ho bought the hairpin and kindly put it on for her.) - Thank you. - It's pretty. I felt like these people... are like family. What annoys me is that... there is no way I can take revenge on Sae Ho and Dae Ho. Isn't there anything worse than Muddy Road? (Is there anywhere lower than Muddy Road?) Something like the road of misery. Or "Fiery Road". (She's bent on revenge.) How can I make my revenge? This is... There's just... nothing much that I can do to make this even. I'll make this a series of revenge. (She'll appear on a transfer ticket revenge series.) I'll plan it in advance, so that Sae Ho is left alone on the road of utter misery. (Send Sae Ho to the road of misery.) So he can experience the heat. If I appear on this program again, I'll... take a fierce revenge. (A sword dance of death) (She enters Tongyeong 50 minutes later while dreaming of revenge) We're back in Tongyeong. (She's worn out.) (I can't believe I'm back here.) I never even imagined this. (It's an hour before transfer tickets loses its effect.) Jin Young... is a newbie compared to us. From this place, - He learned three things. - he says he learned three things. - What was the first? - The first thing is don't... get on the wrong side of someone. (That's right.) What's the second thing? There's nobody to trust. - Third. - You need to make smart choices. He learned everything. (Jin Young learns the lessons of Flower Crew.) (IU returns after experiencing the lessons of Flower Crew herself.) (I return as a different person.) (He walks out to greet her.) You're here. Wait a minute. Let me get that for you. Please come in. Welcome. (Welcome back, IU.) Oh, my. I called you. - Why did you call me? - I missed you. I really missed you. Nothing works out easily. This is that kind of place. I was hopeful. I imagined Flowery Road members going home together. I have something to ask you. Don't you have another one? Even if I use that, you have the silver transfer ticket. If you're not going to use it, you can help another go home. I can make another go home? - Yes. - Of course. - You can send anyone anywhere. - Someone here. Send me home. I would love to say hello... to you in the morning. This is how it turns out to be. (IU, you changed.) I'm thankful. I can't call all three of them, can I? You're scaring me. I'm scared. We can be here together. Then our sleeping places will change. (IU begins to realize the rules of Muddy Road.) I will... (IU holds out her gold transfer ticket.) - Are you beginning? - Do I need to stand up? - You can. - It's better to stand up. (What will her choice be?) - She's having fun. - This is fun. I'm scared. You need to speak in this tone. Like this. I learned it, too. I will use this gold transfer ticket. (She's about to use her gold transfer ticket.) (Who will she call to Muddy Road?) I will give it to Jang Hoon. (She'll give it to me?) That's good. Jang Hoon has a chance to take revenge. What do you mean revenge? If I had known earlier, I could have thought of a bigger picture. (Jang Hoon has two transfer tickets.) Jang Hoon can call for someone and go home. I really want to go home. Now that I'm given the transfer ticket, I really want to go home. (Jang Hoon is torn between going home and plotting the big picture.) (What will his choice be?) (They arrive at another rest area after 2 hours and 30 minutes.) We only have 15 minutes left. We only have 13 minutes left. From Flowery Road, they used the transfer ticket. Are they calling for us? Sae Ho. Sae Ho? Sae Ho used a silver transfer ticket. Sae Ho... called... (Who has Sae Ho called?) Sung Jae. (I need to go in the end.) My goodness. (This is minutes before using the transfer ticket.) - I can't do this on my own. - Let's go. I'll do it. (Sae Ho uses the silver transfer ticket.) I would like to... call Sung Jae... (Sae Ho calls the oldest man.) to Muddy Road. (Sung Jae transfers to Muddy Road.) - My goodness. - Who cares. - This is reality. - They must have traveled far. How do you feel? - Am I the only one? - They have two left. IU... (There's 5 minutes until tickets lose effect. There are 2 remaining.) Don't look at me like that. (Don't look at me.) I knew this would happen. They're dead meat. (Did IU call me?) IU gave her gold transfer ticket to Jang Hoon. He called... (What will happen to them?) (Only one more person can come to Muddy Road.) I'll use the silver transfer ticket first. (He uses the silver transfer ticket first.) With this silver transfer ticket, I'd like to use it on Jin Young. I'd like for him to go home. (Jin Young transfers to the road back home.) - You did well. - Thank you. No need. - Have a safe trip. - You should go quick. Go home quick. - I should take this off. - Right. (He returns the vest.) Give it to IU. (IU on Muddy Road) "Give it to IU." (He has one gold transfer ticket remaining.) I believe this is what IU wants as well. It's not my personal wish. To accompany Sung Jae, I'll call Jung Hwan back. (Jung Hwan transfers to Muddy Road.) Let's call them quick. I'm loving where this is going. We need to have Jung Hwan here. I don't want to stay here for that. I can't stand and watch him come back. The person that Jang Hoon called... with the transfer ticket is... (The staff tell the sad news that one needs to return to Muddy Road.) Jung Hwan. (Congratulations, you're the last prizewinner.) IU! (IU! My goodness.) My goodness. (Seung Yoon is the last man standing.) Let's return... and defeat those... (The two men need to return to Muddy Road.) evil men. Let's go. (The last car to Muddy Road departs.) (Why does he remind me of myself?) How do you feel? What do you mean how I feel? You must feel dumbfounded. (He's used to this.) I feel numb. I haven't taken a shower for two days. Take some rest. - We need to work again. - You should sleep, too. To the other side of the road. (They still need to travel 107.8km.) (They're expected to arrive at 2:30am.) (They can't go back to sleep after being in the car for four hours.) (It feels like as if they'll reach home at the end of this tunnel.) (However, it would be Muddy Road.) (Members at Muddy Road house are getting ready for bed.) (Jin Young changed his clothes and is ready to go home.) - Are you ready? - Yes. I'm ready. You did well today. Goodbye. - I'm jealous. - Don't be. Goodbye. - Have a safe trip. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - See you. I had so much fun. Though I was on Muddy Road, I was happy. I wanted to stay longer, but Jang Hoon was thoughtful that he chose me. I'm going home. I'll be going home first. Thank you. (He politely bids farewell.) (The man that wanted to stay longer leaves for Seoul.) (IU, who has to sleep through a cold night, gets ready for bed.) (The others boiled water for her to use.) (She pours some water into smaller bowl.) (Thanks to others, she's able to wash up with warm water.) (She brushes her teeth.) (I can't get used to this place.) (She washes her face.) (Even on Muddy Road, you need to wash your face thoroughly.) (Don't forget to wash up the soap on your hair.) (She gets ready for bed like everyone else.) (She reveals her bare face.) (She finds herself surrounded by men.) Did you wash up? (She's refreshed...) (and embarrassed.) Goodness! - Oh, my. - You look exactly the same. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - You did good. Goodnight. (They say goodnight and go off to bed.) Goodnight. Goodnight. I think when they arrive, they'll walk over us. - I think they'll pour water on us. - Would they? (They worry about the two on their way.) (Here's another worried person.) (Is the camera on?) How do I turn the lights off? (Should I unplug this?) (I want to turn the lights off, but I don't know how.) (She opens the door.) How do you turn the lights off? - It turns off automatically. - Really? Goodnight. (There was no need to worry.) (She grabs hot water bags to keep her warm.) (I'll go to sleep now.) (It feels strange.) (My feet are poking out.) (It's the other way around.) (She realizes that it's the other way around and gets up.) (Suddenly the lights go out.) (IU goes to bed after tussling with the sleeping bag.) (Goodnight, everyone.) (Two hours pass.) (The old men arrive at Muddy Road house at 2:40am.) Didn't you bring your bag? They're dead meet. (One person is fatigued.) (The other is full of rage.) (Everyone is sound asleep.) Look at them. We're here and you're all asleep? My goodness. (You're here.) Dae Ho. Hello. (He picks up the water bottle.) (He sprays water all over.) Get up. "My goodness?" - Get up. - They're here. (The members are woken up.) I'm sorry for calling you over. Why would you do such a thing? I thought it would be funny. I'm tired. You're tired? (After he hears that,) (he sprays water all over again.) I told you to get up. Where's the girl that sings high notes? (Where's the girl that sings high notes?) I told her... (Is he talking about me?) - Jung Hwan. - Please lower your voice. (They're not budging one bit.) Look at them. (IU comes out to say hello.) She's awake. You should sleep. Why are you out? (I'm here to say hello.) - She's awake now. - You made a big scene. (He feels sorry.) - I came out to say hello. - Go back to sleep. (She feels sorry, so she steps out.) - She's such a nice person. - Did you wake up? You must be cold. - Get back in. - Go back to sleep. - Watch your head. - Be careful. It's nice to have everyone here. (The night feels warm with the seven of them together.) I couldn't sleep. - Were you waiting for me? - I heard you snore. Right? (Their last night in Tongyeong is coming to an end.) (It's 7am at Muddy Road house.) (Rustling) (Dae Ho is the first to wake up.) (Everyone, good morning.) (He clears his throat.) Good morning, everyone. (He probably woke up the whole neighborhood.) You must be deprived of sleep. You're up? (Sung Jae seems like he aged 5 years more.) My goodness. You are so ugly. (I look fine when I wash up.) You really look ugly. (They wake up one at a time.) Oh, my. (They wake up one at a time.) Are you okay? (IU wearily walks out of her room.) You're the same person we saw last night, right? It's the same person that I called, right? (They get ready for morning at Muddy Road house.) It's cool. I feel refreshed. How do you feel? - Bad. - Right? Do you understand... why we weren't able to greet you... when you arrived yesterday? - Yes. - You understand, right? Have a seat here. Let's all sit here. (It's amazing to have such a diverse pool of people.) The fact that we're all here to see the morning sea together. (We're all here to watch the morning sea.) It's not every day I meet IU. I felt happy to have eaten with IU yesterday. (It's time to return home.) Shall we say our chant? - Okay. - For the last time. We're... - Flower Crew. - Flower Crew. Next time, on Flower Crew. Min Ah of Girl's Day. Na Ra of Hello Venus. Seung Ri of Big Bang. This is not a variety show, it's a survival show. - Fantastic. - Fantastic baby. I'm a big fan of Big Bang. You're cute. Don't say Tae Min! I take that back. I'm going to get back at you. I'm going to take revenge. (The sweet taste of life.) Don't trust anybody. (Flower Crew)
