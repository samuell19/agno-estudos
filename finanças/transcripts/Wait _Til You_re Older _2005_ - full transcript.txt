I'm Kwong. I've always hated my dad. Mom died because of him, He took me somewhere... I didn't belong, and made me live with a bitch. if I could turn the clock back, I wouldn't have let my family be ruined, and Kwong wouldn't run away from home. I'm not running away. I'm just returning to my "home". I've kept coming back for the past 3 years, just to remind him that... he forgets mom lived & died here... because of him. Ghost Hand goes near the oven. The cake is popping out. Kwong. Kwong, Kwong. Are you O.K.? Let's go home. Only if you bring mom back. Or else, $300. Then I'll go back with you. It's $200 last time, it's gone up so fast. Didn't we agree not to interfere? You've grown up. Be considerate. You can't spend so much. How' bout $250? A grown-up of course spends more. 795, the police don't meddle in family affairs. Let's go home first. No way, Make a deal first, You hear that? Kwong. As I said, he wouldn't insist. Are you tired? How was camping? Kwong. Brother, you're back. Where did you go camping? Your mom lied. I actually ran away from home, Only Billy is dumb enough to believe... that bitch who does facials all the time. No matter how crafty she is, She'd never guess that... I only need another $300 to get out of here, And become a real grown-up. You haven't grown in all these years. Don't think we won't recognize you. You're too young to sneak away. The cops are gonna get you. Ghost Hand's plan worked. Forget it. 3 spiders are no big deal. We want him to stay, don't we? Forget it. That's not for you. Why? We're too short to grab it. Okay, I'll jump more and grow faster. Sorry, I got up late this morning. It'll be ready soon, Won't have to get up if you're my real mom. Breakfast is ready, What a mess. Good morning, dear. Morning. Morning, dad. Morning. Thanks. Eat the veggies. Damn, There's a basketball team meeting. Gotta go. Stop that. Stop that. I'll make whatever you wanna eat, Time for school. Take this raincoat. It's sunny, Take it anyway, The weather's fine. But the forecast says it'll rain, Look, it's fine. Just take it. O.K.. Take care. My potion, What's up? You fancy her? Oh boy, I see you tail her everyday. You have good taste. Look up. If you fancy her, own up, Act like a man, You gotta have dreams for the future. Want my help? Let me yell for you, I haven't yelled yet, Kwong. Are you lost? No, Why don't you greet your teacher? You've been absent for days. I was sick, Lucky you, You get ill whenever you like, Tell you a secret. I envy you kids. I'm sleepy and want a sick leave every morning. Let's race, and see who gets to school first. I always walk this way... to keep myself awake. You try. Hurry up, I've lost, I like Miss Lee, Like my own mom, her ear has got 3 piercings. Miss Lee, I'm getting married with Mr. Chow next month. I'm busy that day, Miss Lee, let's have lunch. I have something to tell you. Good morning. I'm booked up from today until then. Christ! No one passes the ball like that. He's always like that before a match, He ignores other team members. He's sweaty and smells like shit, What the hell? Don't get it personal just coz you got hit. So your dad's the coach but you're not in our team. You cover him up? I'm scared. Scared of what? Who's talking? I can't see, Bear, you want me to thrash him? If you do, yell 3 times after me, Quiet. Aren't you supposed to be training? Time for class now. Come on, let's go to class. Bear, let's go. You have to think, pal. What? Pressure from the Principal. if the team loses again... it will be demoted to Division 3. it'll hurt our reputation. The team's playing pretty well. Anyone can play. But winning relies on teamwork. Those ungrateful sods. Without you, they couldn't have won last time. I'm nervous before every match, Still no excuse for personal assault. Oh, never mind. How useless, As you're so big, you should stare hard next time they bully you. it'll shut them up. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Kwong. Miss Lee, Hurry up for class, Yes It's about Miss Lee, Let me tell you a secret, Hurry up, Over here, The key to the lab. Come on. I've a secret. But keep it quiet. Last night, I dreamed of Miss Lee, she's in a mini-skirt and dancing with me. You fancy Miss Lee too. She looks best when dancing. You nutcase! She loves jogging. She jogged to school with me today. She just treats you like a kid, because a shorty like you can't dance. it doesn't mean she's into dancing. Dad says women all love dancing, My parents dance a lot, Trust me. Let me show you. A one & a two, & three Six & seven. I still think Miss Lee prefers jogging. Listen, today is mom's birthday. Just pretend this present is from you. I'm not like some deceitful people. Kwong. No way, $200, Come back earlier for dinner tonight. They're happy with the bitch. He must have forgotten us. Ghost Hand, it's action time. You're back. Let's have dinner. Dinner time, We're all here. Let's eat. Allow me... Kwong, sit properly. Allow me. Looks delicious. Great. Your birthday present. See what a good son Kwong is. Oh yes, and inside this... Let's eat, Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday to mommy. Happy Birthday to you. The cake is poisoned. Brother said it's poisoned. Apologize to mom. She's not my mom. My mom is dead, You two caused her death. Sit down. Stay still. What did you say? Say I'm not your mom again. So I'm not your mom? Once you leave, don't ever come back. Don't ever come back, I want my rucksack back, I'm going. See if I care. Eat the cake, Awesome? I said so already. Our future is full of hope. My potion can turn seedlings into tall trees in one day. To create this potion, I climbed 8000m up Mt. Makalu... where the snow water, is rich in ion. Then... I dived 3000m underwater... for the eyes of the insomniac fish. Then, I ventured into the rainforest of Sumatra... for the eggs of the immortal bird. And then, I returned to my hometown, to pick up the snow lotus. After 3 years of experiments, and continuous failures, I finally got this potion right, Please wait, Don't try to steal my potion, Don't even think, Sell it to me then. I can turn into an adult if I take it, Then no cops will recognize me, and dad won't drag me home. Come back, you little rascal. Don't run, Come back. Special news: this morning at Victoria Park, a tree over 10m high was found having... sprung overnight from the gutter. According to specialists... most trees take 30 years to grow to that height. is this a natural phenomenon, or was it planted deliberately by someone? Let's talk to a regular visitor to this park. Madam, what do you think happened? I have no clue, it's providence. it's a sign for you to make a wish. Professor Chan, tell us your opinion. Obviously, it's a behavioral art... performed by environmentalists... in emulation of the Swedish master. The message is to save the Earth. it also attacks the authoritarian paradigm: "Cesspit only breeds noxious weeds." This homeless guy must've slept here overnight. Let's interview him, Excuse me, may I interview you? Excuse me, It won't take a minute, This gentleman should know... better than anyone else. Your name please? No problem. Did you notice... this tree before you fell asleep. His expression tells us that... he's not sure if he saw the tree... when he went to sleep. Did you experience... anything weird last night? His expression tells us that... Iast night, he experienced... something unbelievable... something very disturbing. Let's check his present state of mind. How do you feel now? His expression tells that... he's still unable to calm down. Let's give him more time. Over to Chan at our news room. We won't come back. Excuse me, Excuse me, do you mind... opening the door? My hands are full, Sorry. Are you crazy? It's less than 48 hrs, We can't do anything. It's not even your son's first time, This time, my wife kicked him out. I am so worried, We brought him back yesterday, then you kicked him out again. Are you trying to give us trouble? Sir. Who are you looking for? I'm the brother of Bear, Class 1 E. I got a call. He seems to be ill. I come to pick him up. Please go that way. Thank you. Wait. You dropped something. Thank you, Joe. Pass the ball quickly, Tackle the Forward. Don't let him round. Pass the ball, Hey man, Why whistle so loudly? Scared of losing tomorrow but playing cool? Me scared? Fan, Bear. Bear, give it to me. Are you O.K.? O.K.? Mr. Chow, you see? Bear's incompetent. We don't think he should play tomorrow. It's not deliberate, As Team Captain, I request he withdraw. He never passes well. How can we win? Enough said. I got it. But... Mr Chan is the coach, Let him decide... who should stay. But you're held responsibility for the team, Right, that's why he has hesitations. Mr, Chan, Mr, Chan, Your wife just called the office. She'll call the cops if you don't call her back. Thank you. Regarding Bear, I'll leave it up to you. Bear, I'm always with you. We're ready to sacrifice ourselves... for the glory of our school. But... basketball is about team work. That's enough. No bullshit. They're ousting you. Why stay here? Who are you? I'm Bear's brother, I have no brother, How dare you not recognize me, it's brighter here. Take a closer look. Over here. They don't want you. Why are you still staying? Who are you? Kwong sent me here. Kwong? Does this ring a bell? Just hold on. Are you the Vice Principal? I am, I'm Bear's brother, Something happened at home. May I take him home now? No problem. Please go ahead. Great. Let's go. The school relies on you... and your spirit. Try your best. Yes, sir. Lucky you said you're my brother, Otherwise, Mr. Chow wouldn't let go of me. Just ignore him. I didn't show up today. Did my dad ask? Who's your dad? Mr, Chan, I'm Kwong. Don't you recognize me? You're... I'm Kwong. You're really Kwong? That's right. Stop kidding. I'm not kidding. Can't you feel it? I'm Kwong. Come on, can't you recognize me? Not really, That's impossible. We're buddies. You don't feel anything? Not really, Don't run, Let me go... Don't. Stop shouting. Stop, or I'll tell Miss Lee that... you dreamed of her in a miniskirt. No, don't. How do you know? I told you I'm Kwong, At last, I've become an adult. If you try, your dream will come true, I have a big dream too. But my dad never consents to it, As your important adult friend, I'll fulfill your wish if you yell 3 times, Miss Lee is here, How many persons? Two, This way please. Damn, if she sees me, I'm done for. So what? You have your back to her. Sir, how about the beer that lady ordered? it's in promotion now. O.K.. 2 glasses please. 2 beers? He's a child, No alcohol for child, O.K.. One beer and one Coke. Yes sir. Thanks. See how these 2 adults behave. Let's take a picture. What for? Thanks. Enjoy your beer. Tastes good? Enjoy it. I'm going over there. You haven't told me about your wedding. Am I just an ordinary acquaintance? I'm older than you 10 years more, if we're together, you'd get bored soon. Why sell yourself short? If you're going to marry Miss Wong, why lied and said you're leaving her? I did think of it, As one gets older, one's social circle shrinks. Valued memories left fewer and fewer I realized I couldn't let go of her. Maybe I'm a coward, You're not. You just gave up halfway. Whatever. it's best we never meet again. No one cares about you anymore, just let go, Don't put yourself down. You'll let down my brother and my dad. It's none of your business, I'm telling my brother off, not you. Miss Lee, Bear? You're... I'm his teacher, How about you? I'm his brother, Great. Both of you are heartbroken. Sit down. Let's have a chat. I can't understand why you act like this, What's up? Stop giggling. Stop. Or I'll punch you. You two seem having fun. Let's order more drinks. Cheer up. No way, She's heartbroken, Exactly, Best to drown her sorrows, Half a dozen please. Sure. Thanks. Half a dozen please. Hurry up. Is the beer for you? How dare you, He needs to go. I'm taking him home. Are you OK? Give me your phone number. I'll call later. To make sure you got home in one piece. Come on... You really think I'm drunk? My face is so red, Dad's gonna get mad, Don't worry, I'm dead meat, I'm an adult, I'll back you up, Really? Of course, Dad, Are you back? Yes. Why is your face all red? He's been drinking. Drinking? What for? He's feeling down. Feeling down? Sit down. If you're unhappy, tell me, What's the matter? I'm his Form Teacher, If you're unhappy, talk to me, What's wrong? Well... I'm ousted from the match tomorrow, You silly boy. Just train harder. You'll have your turn next. Really? Of course, it's not his fault. He's a well player. But the other boys are ostracizing him, They're just being childish. Haven't I always told you... the taller you are, the bigger is your mind? Exactly, Otherwise, you wouldn't have friends. You're a good dad. You're a good teacher. Few teachers care so much about pupils. Bear, Could you do me a favor? Please apologize to his classmates, and ask them to come over to play. Go wash your face. You'd feel better. You too. it's good to see you. Please stay for dinner. Please freshen up first. Hurry up, Bear, Your mom's waiting, Your dad is so nice and warm. Should I stay here? Don't be an idiot, You're my teacher. No teacher stays with his pupil, Not even for a night. Why not? You can try to ask. Time for dinner, brother. My sister, She's from our hometown. Your elder sister? No, my mom. Your mom? Dinner's ready, Let's have dinner, Mom, my teacher's here for a family visit. Please help yourself. My wife is young and pretty, right? isn't she a good match for me? Yes, of course. Just kidding. I'm getting old. Luckily, I can find a wife in the Mainland, Does she love you? He asked if you love me, What kind of question is that? Excuse me, Of course mom loves dad. She keeps asking him to come. Dad will go back in the next 2 days. Mistress is about to deliver soon, You live with a mistress? That's the name of our sow. She's quite something. Last time, she gave birth to 1 5 sucklings. You like dancing. How can you dance without a partner? Sure you can. How? Let me demonstrate, Really? Like this, You can dance. You're not afraid he'll fall for another woman? What has she to fear? She keeps an eye on me every night. You said you can't live without me for a second. I have to feed our pig. Enjoy your meal. O.K.. I see why you'd never run away from home, You want to run away? Does Bear want to run away? Come back here to help me then. Don't get excited. You have our daughter. Bear should stay with me. But seriously, if anyone runs away, a family will be ruined. You've got to return it to my dad. Your family is a lot of fun. No way, It's old and grubby, But it's warm, I wonder why your home's different from mine, Get some sleep. We have to go to the match. Don't you have any pride? They won't let you play. Didn't you hear dad's words? That's true. Well, just tell a lie. Just say you apologized sincerely, but they took no notice of it. Come with me if you're my buddy. I have no time for you, I'm an adult, I don't care for these childish matters, Good night. Oh dear. I don't tell lie, Dad can see through it once I stammer. You really won't stand by me? I'm not scared anymore, Send your son to boarding school after he returns. He is still young, Let's wait till he comes back, No way, It's been 3 years since his mom died, Let's repaint the apartment. I saw a Feng ShuI program on TV. Red is this year's lucky color, and good for you too. Really? Come home. Lets talk. $500. Dad Want me home, bring mom back 1 st. Ghost Hand Kwong. Kwong. Shit, you've messed it up. I'm late now, You nuts, You're crazy. You'd still be late if you go now. Jack, though we lost the game and... got demoted, it doesn't matter. Bear? What is he up to? Jack, it's Bear here. What are you here for? He's still alive, Yes, Are you here to gloat over... my failure? Oh no. The whole team is responsible. Not your fault alone, You didn't play. How'd you know? I do. Before I came to HK, I was in the school team in my hometown, a lousy player? Our school team even got in the finals. But I screwed up and we're defeated. I hid away like you, But dad said I was silly, He said a team is like a family, Family always stands by you, But you're always nervous before a match, Coz I'm never treated as one of you guys. I can't play again if I screw up. If you're not one of us, why do you still care? Because I treat you as family, Gotta come out earlier. they got to change earlier. Please come out, And got home earlier. No one needs to go early. What nonsense. Only a shameless adult would say that. You get it? Who are you? I'm Bear's eldest brother, Allow me. it's no use hiding in there. Kids and adults all need friends, right? Even if you don't treat them as friends, they still think you are. They want to have a group photo with you. it'll just take 3 seconds. Come on. Ready? Ready? All set? Hurry up, Look this way, One, two, three. Mr. Chow, take one for me. O.K.. Let's change places. Why you have a stubble? So what? it looks more mature. Miss Lee would love it, Oh yeah? But... Miss Lee fancies Mr, Chow, Three. Done, Time to go. Everything O,K,? That's quick, O.K. what? Well, you're good. Hey, Bear's brother, Let me introduce, This is our coach, Mr. Chan. How do you do? Nice to meet you, Sorry for what happened. It's my fault the kids got upset, There're more upsetting things ahead. Our team has been demoted. I have no budget to renew your contract. You'd better pull your socks up. Let's wait and see, No point in waiting. Look, I just resolved a crisis for you. Now, you are creating another one. It's bad for the kids... if you keep changing teachers. If you don't believe me, ask them, Attention. You like changing teachers all the time? No way, You think Mr. Chan is a swell coach? Oh yeah. Please listen to me, We'll handle the problem. No need to get the pupils involved. Why can't the pupils be involved? It's for the sake of the kids, Anyway, let's get to the point, I want to see Mr, Chan... coaching next year. No negotiation. Or else, I'll complain. Complain about what? Of your disreputable conduct? What disreputable conduct? You must know. I'm an upstanding teacher. I know all your dirty secrets, What do you mean? Don't act innocent. I have nothing to fear. Well, well. We'll see. Your dirty deeds have been sent. What have you done? I already sent his picture, What have you done? I'm with you, Whom did you send it to? Everyone, What did you send? What exactly? Well... You are over. And you're done for. Let's go. What is it? Nothing. O.K., I've got one too. Miss Lee must know it's us who did it, Have you found her yet? Not yet, She was rehearsing a play in the hall, She vanished after we got the photo. But Joe said she never left the campus. Where are you going? Do we have rehearsal tomorrow? Who knows? Let's see. Have you seen Miss Lee? Nope. She probably left. Thanks. How much longer do we have to search? Until she's found. What if we can't find her? Then we go home. Well... You can go now. Thanks. What kind of a teacher. I'm Bear's brother, I know you're here, Come out, it's no use hiding. Come out. Let's talk. Got you. I came here to have a good cry. Why can't you leave me alone? You hide so others will look for you. Yes, I do want someone to find me. But that someone is not you, That someone has gone home already. Don't be sad, He doesn't like you, Why still waiting? I just want to. How much longer? Until he comes. Just leave me alone. It's locked, We have to spend the night here. Too bad I lost the lab key yesterday. Or we wouldn't be stuck. You mean this one? How come you've got it? Bear found it in the changing room. No need to look, I drew it, Are you still... mad at us about the photo? Of course. At first, he said he'd dump Miss Wong. That's why I went out with him. Since he lied to me. I wanna to tell everyone that... we are lovers. But I didn't have the guts. Come on, he's off duty. I often met that jerk here. We prepared meals here. Whenever I wanted to meet him, I'd draw this on the entrance, He'd make a mark to say he'd come, We'd meet here when classes are over. In this way, nobody knows as he's said, Sometimes I don't get you adults... treating love as a game. Besides, Mr. Chow's much older... That's what I like about him. Mature and reliable, However, maturity is unreliable. it's not good to be... in a love triangle. You'll earn a bad name. What is it? A bitch. As if I can help it. If you don't, just quit... this love game. I'll help. How? Fall in love with me, I'm not attached, My love has gone, Every man says that, How did you meet her? I've known her since a kid, She bought me gifts since I was 4. I had planned on... spending my whole life with her. However, unexpectedly... she refused to go with me... to study abroad a few years ago. And she refused to tell me the reason. I threw a huge tantrum. I thought she disliked me but she didn't. Actually, she'd fallen in love... with someone. Someone she shouldn't have fallen for. Dad's going to work. Let's play tomorrow. See you later. See you. Since then, she looked miserable everyday. Suddenly... I proposed that we... commit suicide together. She agreed. So we baked a cake. That was poisoned. However, I... at the last minute, I chickened out, I really regret it, I miss her, I miss her so much, Sorry. Sorry. Let me help you. I'll try to love you, Great. Don't go to sleep. Don't. Did you eat any cake? I want to... sleep over on that side. Don't fall asleep. Let's chat some more. When did you pierce your ears? You're so silly. Kwong. You ran away from home twice in a week. You're such a pain. What's up? Nothing. Got a shock? What is it? It's you again, Mr Chan? Are you playing spooky? He always hides out in here, Not this time, He doesn't want you to find him, Then how shall I find him? You will, when he stops hiding. Don't you get it? Just go home, We'll contact you when we find him. 795, do you still want kids after marriage? Think. If you have a happy family, why would your son run away? Men like to vanish whenever they want, Sorry, Miss Lee. I've left. Don't hide here again. Let's go to a movie. Wait for my call. if I keep on aging this fast... can Miss Lee still recognize me? Bear What? When I woke up, I aged a lot. I even got gray hairs. So? Dad said it turns women on. Well... Would Miss Lee like it? It's only been 3 days, He's aging faster than I thought. Enough talking. I'm late. Hello? Did you see my note this morning? I did. 9:30 tonight, right? I guess we're dating? Hello? Are you not happy? As soon as I think of him, I can't be. He deceived you, You still miss him? At least, I still hate him. Whenever I think about him, I feel miserable, I have a hunch you'll see a bitch soon, No kidding? Let's talk later, You don't have to resign. The Principal has let the case rest. I want to leave and forget you guys. is that possible? I was planning to tell you that... Mr. Chow confessed all when he proposed to me. And you're still marrying him? You love him that much? He said sorry, so I forgave him, That's not fair. He never said sorry to me, Not everyone has that guts to face it, You're here to prove you've got over it? Actually, I'm not sure if I have. But I have to make the first move, Otherwise none of us can be happy. Sorry. Hello? Hey, Are we seeing the 9:30 show tonight? Of course. You'd better keep your promise. I have to go home first. What for? Wanna get changed. Wait for me even if I'm late. I'll, definitely. it's great. I've cheered Miss Lee up. Really? Yes. And then what? I asked her out tonight. Awesome. Now, I want a shower. But the bitch is... at home. Let me go to your place. The key is at the entrance. O.K.. Don't use the red soap. it's for dad. O.K.. That's it. Here comes the teacher, Bye, Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. How long are you going to search? We got no choice but to keep looking. But this is unfair, How about we hide and they seek? What a waste. Don't want the pupils to see. Sir, can you spare a fag? What, how dare you. Get lost. Get lost. Are you some kind of paparazzi? Snapping pics of our gay affair? Not at all. I just want to... I want to apologize to you. Bear and I didn't mean it, Oh, let it rest. Can I have a go? I hardly ever run into you here, Well yes. I don't want to.... Hold on. You guys come here often? When I don't feel like going home. When I need a breather from my wife. Are you married? Not yet, You single guys can't understand. We're not so much of a loser here. But don't you think... you're not facing reality? it's not about facing reality. It's whether others understand our situation, As I said, he wouldn't get it. Like my son, He's run away for 2 days, it's not that I'm not facing reality but there are two sides to a coin. Sorry. He thinks we adults don't care about him, But it's the kids who don't give us a chance. Let's go. You see? Don't they deserve a thrashing? But how? They're kids and I'm not, Beat them up? My point is... it's neither about facing reality, nor about courage. It's only a sigh in our lives, Things happen, but we can't always cope. If only I could be a kid and start anew. You should be old enough to understand. No, that's not so easy. He's not a teacher, nor is he married. I might understand. Even your son might understand, If I were your son, I would say sorry to you, Too bad you're not him. Let's have another round, Come on. Wait. Hello? I'll be back soon, See you later, Miss Wong? 2 more games only. Can't keep her waiting. We shouldn't make women unhappy. Got to go. I'm sorry, Let's have a game next time. Bye, Are you free? How about a game? O.K. Hello? Yes, Alright. I'll be back soon. Bye. Gotta go? My wife urged me home for dinner, Aren't you going? Yeah, pretty soon. What are you scared of? Been naughty? Don't worry, If you pretend nothing's happened, she can't do anything. Don't be silly, I'm serious, Perhaps i'd better go with you. Women never act up in front of outsiders. Let's go after this game. Smile. Relax. Smile a bit more. O.K., maybe hold back that smile. I'm home, dear. We have a guest. Please set the table. Help yourself. This is Bear's brother. Nice to meet you, Help yourself. Have a drink, You seem like one happy family. Except my eldest son is troublesome. She doesn't look like a mom of two. She only gave birth to the younger boy. Auntie, so you're a stepmother? My memory of the past is hazy, I can't recall her anymore, I only care about my present wife and sons, You came between them, so know your place. Your son may accept you one day. You really can't remember? Take a closer look. Remember now? What's the big deal for just a photo? Just a photo? Why keep a photo for so long? Why told me you chucked it and it's over? After such a long time you still miss her. What about the one still alive-Me? That's the predicament of home-wreckers. You got to take it. Please keep quiet. It's because you always keep quiet, What's that? You kept quiet... cheating on me after we're married. You kept quiet when she had your child. What? The boy thinks I'm his Stepmom. He blames me for his mom's death, And you still keep quiet. Silence doesn't mean OK.. It doesn't make you impervious to blame, I never needed this, Since she came along, I never stopped using it. Actually, I'm cheating myself. Just as well this photo tells all. Neither of us can put her behind us. I've never forgiven you. Dear, I'm the biggest loser. You can all stay. I'm the one who should go. Take this, brother. Ask dad not to leave. Are you O.K.? Yes, I'm fine. Billy, Billy, are you O,K,? What? Brother, It's brother, Kwong. Kwong. Kwong. Kwong. Bear's Brother, Have you seen my son? I'm sorry, It's family matters that... you won't understand. You should have told your son earlier. It wouldn't work, He won't understand, He's convinced I abandoned his mom, He doesn't know how much I cherish them, He'll believe you, He'll mend his ways, And he'll come home soon. It's not a home anymore, My wife hates me, My son refuses to come back, it's not like a pack of cigarettes... that I can easily grabbed. Smoke less. Sure, I can try.

How dare you said that, You caused all this mess. Just fix it. Fix it. Fix it, Still don't get it after cycling around? Life is like a passage. Too bad it's a one-way trip. Good thing is, there's no need to return. Sir. I'm sorry, Please help me, I just want to go back to what it used to be. I really do, I swear I won't do it again, It's not too late to realize this, I told you, the future is full of hope. Even if you've one day left, you must make the most of it. Miss, The show's over. it's getting late. I'm still waiting for someone. if he never comes, will you get mad?
