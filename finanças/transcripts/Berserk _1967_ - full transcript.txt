Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK (APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen! And now the only act of its kind performing without a net. The most death defying tight wire act, Gaspar the Great! (APPLAUSE) (SNAPPING) (SCREAMING) Hand me tonight's receipts, Dorando. Your hands are trembling. Monica, how can you sit there so calmly and check box office receipts after that horrible catastrophe? How can you be so cold-blooded? Realistic is the word. It's a good thing I took control when it happened. If I depended on you, we would have had a panic on our hands. Yes, it's a good thing you're inhuman. We're running a circus, not a charm school. And most important, people have to be entertained. - Yes, yes. "The show must go on." - Always. No matter what the cost? Mmm. Like in a war. Troops are expendable. Privates and generals alike. Expendable. Are you aiming that at me? You think you can do without me? Not yet. What if I insist? I'm fed up. All you have to do is buy me out. I'm not ready for you to leave. You know very well I can't afford to buy you out. You'll just have to wait. I want out now. I'm leaving. Oh, you miserable, gutless adding machine! What are you trying to do? Ruin my circus? - And you have the nerve to want to... - (KNOCKING) Come in! - Miss Rivers? - Yes. I'm Detective Sergeant Hutchins. This is Detective Constable Bradford. How can I help you, gentlemen? Well, first I must tell you that none of Gaspar's equipment must be moved or touched until it's been checked by our experts. Of course. Now just a few questions. Who built the apparatus that was used in the high-wire act? Gaspar himself had the units hand-constructed. - Did anyone else handle it? - Yes, our labour crew. He always checked it personally, though. If you like, I can give you the names of the helpers. Well, we shall need more than that. Please have all your performers and workers assembled at ten o'clock tomorrow morning for routine questioning. Yes, yes, of course. You understand this investigation might take a few days? And until then, nobody is to leave the circus. Nobody. Good night. - Good night. - (CAR DRIVING AWAY) (LAUGHING) Well, Dorando, you heard the law. Nobody leaves. That'll keep you from deserting me while I still need you. You always win, don't you, Monica? If you had a brain in your head, you'd see that you win, too. What do you mean? Well, so far we've had a bad season. And now with the accident, the splash publicity, it's going to be great for the box office. People have a morbid curiosity about death. Especially a violent one. That's why I'm sure that we'll be jam-packed tomorrow night, with people hoping they'll see a repeat performance of death. It really excites you. I haven't seen you in such high spirits since we started the tour. Poor Dorando. Why are you always so depressed? What can I do to cheer you up? You know what? I just may let you tuck me in tonight. But first, there are a few things you have to attend to. I want you to get photographs of Gaspar and send them to all the newspapers. It'll dress up the story. Then I want you to wire all the agents in London, Paris and Berlin. Get a top act to replace him. But that will take me most of the night. So what's the difference? I'm a light sleeper. I've got a great equestrian act for you, Miss Rivers: The Gorraras. The last time they performed, two of their horses dropped dead in the ring of old age. What about the Fabulous Glen? He's still the best trick cyclist in the business. When he's sober, which isn't often. Look, don't waste my time with these broken down has-beens. Some of them are as old as my elephants and twice as wrinkled. I want something fresh. A new face with an exciting act. I'd like to talk to you, Miss Rivers. - What about? - My act. - Frank Hawkins is the name. - I never heard of you. Well, I'm new in this part of the world. But I overheard you tell them that you wanted something fresh and exciting. - And you, of course, fill the bill? - I certainly do. Don't you have an agent? I do better handling myself. You see, Bruno, we have a double daredevil. Agent and artist all rolled into one. After you've seen my act, you'll agree with me. I must say you certainly are the shy type. What do you do? - High wire act. - That's a bit of luck. You know, of course, what happened to our last one, Gaspar the Great. I caught his act last night. Saw him hanging around. Leave the comedy to Bruno and the rest of the clowns. I haven't time for your grisly jokes. Just give me the details of your act. - High-wire. Sixty feet up over a... - I know, over a safety net. No, not quite. Why don't you see the act for yourself? One performance. You can make up your mind. And if I like it? How much? I'll leave the money up to you. See my act tonight, and if I'm not worth top money, well, this place is loaded with exits. On those terms, you got a deal. Mr Hawkins! You're a bit jumpy, aren't you, Mr Hawkins? I don't like being touched. Especially by a stranger. Well, we won't be strangers for long. My name is Harrison Liston. I specialise in the representation of circus acts and novelties. I don't care what you do. We haven't met, but I know you, Mr Hawkins. - What the hell do you want? - I want to help you. I listened to you selling yourself just now. Wonderful, quite wonderful. Up to a point. And then you kill your case by leaving the money up to Monica Rivers. I handle my own affairs. Now, why don't you mind your own business? You need me in other ways. After all, you're a foreigner in this country. I can, er... smooth over some bothersome details for you. Look, I don't want anything from you, so why don't you leave me alone? As I said, I can smooth over some bothersome details Like, er... getting you a labour permit. After all, you wouldn't want the authorities to know about what happened in Canada, would you, Mr Hawkins? It might make getting that labour permit a bit difficult. (GROANING) All right. All right! Don't ever come near me again. (LIVELY CIRCUS MUSIC) (APPLAUSE) And now, it is my special privilege to give you that daredevil of the high wire, The Magnificent Hawkins! Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to see the only act of its kind in the entire world. The Magnificent Hawkins performs without a net sixty feet above the steel bayonets and wearing a blindfold. He defies death with every step. I now call your attention to the arena directly under the wire. Ladies and gentlemen, in his walk of death, The Magnificent Hawkins! (APPLAUSE) Here's your contract. Thank you, Mr Dorando. You'll find everything in that agreement to your satisfaction. You should, with that salary. It's the biggest bite any performer has ever taken out of this circus. You're older than I am, Mr Dorando, but I'm sure you'll agree in this world you only get what you deserve. No more, no less. You can keep your little gems of wisdom to yourself. What about my private caravan? - Miss Rivers promised me that I... - I don't care what Miss Rivers promised. On business deals, my decision is final. Besides, we don't happen to have an extra caravan. Unless of course you'd like me to give up mine. No, thanks. It's not nearly comfortable enough. Thank you for letting me keep it. Next season, if you're still with us, and continue to draw, we'll think about your private caravan. Maybe I won't have to wait that long. That's, er, Hawkins. I-N-S. Frank Hawkins. Looks pretty good, doesn't it? Don't get carried away, son. I've painted many names on these caravans, and I've painted many out. And I've yet to come across a name that could outlive the paint. And now, ladies and gentlemen, we give you the world's greatest elephant act. (BLOWING WHISTLE) (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) MONICA: And now, Jody, the wonder elephant, weighing over five tons, will walk over six girls lying on the floor of the arena. (TRUMPETING) (APPLAUSE) Sure beats eating in the canteen. We ought to do it more often. I'm crazy about you, Monica. - I'm fond of you, Frank. - No more? Why should there be more? You're still a stranger to me. Actually, I know very little about you. You... well, you don't talk about your past. That's because I'm only interested in the future. Our future. Ha-ha. Not so fast, Frank. I like you, but I don't want this to mushroom. Why not? What are you scared of? Long ago... One day I'll give you all the chapters. Long ago, I lost the capacity to love. Let's enjoy what we have. It makes this crazy circus life more bearable. You sure know how to put out a fire. If you want me to spell it out for you, I will. To me, what we have is no more important than a greeting card. Sometimes maybe not as friendly. I'll make you change your mind. - You'll try, and you'll fail. - Why? - Too many obstacles. - Like Dorando? He's just my business partner. Well, I hate the old lecher! The way he drools over you. The way he watches me all the time. - He stinks of jealousy. - Stop it! That's just what I mean. You get all worked up and spoil everything. Now look, Frank. What I do with my life is strictly my own affair. I'll remember that. And now... I need my sleep. Good night, Monica. - (CLANGING THUD) - (SCREAMING) (FRANTIC KNOCKING) BRUNO: Miss Rivers! Miss Rivers! Just a minute. (KNOCKING CONTINUES) Miss Rivers, please come quick. Something terrible has happened. It's Mr Dorando. (LION ROARING) Listen everybody, I know how terribly shocked we all are. There's no point in you staying up any longer. Please go back to sleep. Please. "Go to sleep"! That's her remedy for everything, as if we were children. If you listen to me, we do not go to sleep. Not yet. (HISSING) It is clear to me there is a killer loose, and none of us is safe until the murderer is caught. I'm really frightened. After what I just saw, I'm so scared I can hear me bones rattle. Even I admit it. For the first time in my life, my nerves bother me. I am stronger than two horses, you all know that when I bend an iron bar with my teeth, it is for real. Iron! But even I cannot fight what I cannot see. Exactly. That is why we must find out who is behind these killings. These killings? You don't think Gaspar was an accident, do you? Only a fool would swallow that. Who are you? The Chief of Police? Well, how do you know what's what? That's right! I say we do what Miss Rivers told us. Go to bed. Leave police work to the police. And entertaining to us. You! You wouldn't stick your neck out to save your mother. Oh, why don't you shut up? Look at her. She can't wait to get back to the caravan and her bottle of booze. Who do you think you are? Why don't you two go and fight in your own caravan? Well, I'm not afraid to come right out and say it. We all know that Miss Rivers has lost no sleep over these murders. With my own ears I heard her say that murder is good for business. Doesn't that tell you who's behind them? I ask you, when did we ever play to such capacity crowds? The circus has never done such good business. I tell you, she's behind the whole thing. Matilda, you're crazy! You're a hothead. A lunatic! BRUNO: That's what I say. We all know it can't be Miss Rivers. You speak for yourself. We all know you're her slave. Give the others a chance to talk. You! You advertise yourself as a clairvoyant. You tell fortunes. Who do you say is responsible? About murder? Leave me out. I know nothing. All you're interested in is having your palm crossed. - Why don't you speak up? - Yes, this is most urgent. So, tell us. What do the stars and your tea leaves and your crystal ball tell you? They tell me to mind my own business. You're not only a fake but a coward! You see! We have to take things into our own hands and stop these killings before we're all murdered one by one. And I say once again, it's the boss! (LION GROWLING) You hear the lions? They smell blood. They're very sensitive. Last night, they were restless. Ahh! Before you get carried away, let me ask some questions. - You, Emil. - What about me? I refresh your memory. Last year in West Berlin, you told me that Dorando promised you a raise. So what? But he never gave it to you. So you held a grudge against him. I wouldn't kill over money! - No? - I wouldn't! You always walk alone at night. Yeah, that's right. I myself have seen you. Then it could be you. What are you doing walking alone in the middle of the night? Me, I walk for fresh air. Fresh air? Who believes that? You told me you hated Dorando. And you once told me you hated Gaspar because he made fun of your whiskers. Maybe you did it. You fool! How could I ever get away with murder? I'm the easiest one in the whole circus to identify. You see my beard before you see me. But you! I heard you tell Gaspar to keep away from your wife. That's true. I warned him to stay away. Look, I may be all bones, but I can still use a gun. Anyway, she still left me. She couldn't take the bruises. (EVERYONE ARGUING AT ONCE) Hold it! Hold it, everyone! We'll never get anywhere fighting among ourselves. Take my word for it. It's the boss! MONICA: You're right. You'll never get anywhere, period. You slut! You miserable ingrate! When I picked you and your lover Lazlo up, you were starving. I advanced you money for your act, gave you billing. And how do you repay me? By stirring up trouble behind my back! - You can't frighten us. I still say... - Cut your tongue out first. I can still get a dozen acts like yours. And you! If it weren't for me, you'd all starve to death. - We're frightened. - We're nervous. I know what you are. Look, let me do the worrying. Now get back to your caravans. We're sold out for tomorrow's matinee, and I want a great show. Lazlo! I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let's say that you just got carried away. But that loud-mouthed Matilda, you'd better control her, shut her up, or I'll cancel your act and toss you both out of here. Ah! You sent for me, Commissioner? Brooks, I hate to mar the picture, but you'll have to remove that boutonnière. - You know how allergic I am to pollen. - Oh, I'm very sorry, sir. Tell me, Superintendent, when you were a little boy, did you ever want to run away and join a circus? No, sir. Not at all. No, I had a very happy life, with love on both sides, plus a liberal allowance and two doting aunts. Well, spare me the details, because you've just joined a circus. I have? May I ask in what capacity? Well, certainly not as a performer. I want you to go to Liverpool. - The Rivers Circus? - Exactly. And I'm glad to see you read something besides the society page. Well, I guess I'm like most people, sir. Reading about murder gives me a thrill. Yes, well your job is to stop it. It's a little bit late for that, isn't it? At least for Mr Dorando, with a spike through his head. I saw some pretty gruesome pictures downstairs. Sir, I understood, that, er... you were bringing your suspects here. What suspects? The murderer didn't leave a single clue. Anyway, Brooks, you hunt a wild animal in its native habitat. You don't bring a tiger up from the jungles of Asia - to shoot it in Hyde Park. - I quite agree, sir. Did the local police come up with anything? Nothing. From the report, the killer must have worn skin-tight gloves, and the ground around had been trampled on by too many people to get any footprints. This circus is rather accident-prone, isn't it? I recall there was another gruesome death. Mmm. That's item two on the agenda. Three weeks ago in Leeds, their star performer, a high wire virtuoso called Gaspar the Great, was hung to death by his own wire when it broke beneath his feet. Was that an accident? Well, the death of the second man makes it look like murder, doesn't it? I'll be ready to leave in an hour, sir. Before you go, Superintendent, just a piece of fatherly advice. - Always ready to receive that, sir. - That suit you have on, it looks new and expensive. - Savile Row? - Of course. And hand-made shoes. Dressing smartly is a fetish of yours. - Well, sir, I don't drink, or gamble. - I know, your only passion, apart from your work, is your wardrobe. - Yes, sir. Your advice? - Just this: Leave your expensive feathers in their moth-proof containers. You'll find this circus a rather untidy place. Brooks, concentrate on the job. I know you're the man for it. That's why I'm letting you handle it alone. There's one more city on their itinerary before they arrive here in London. Stay with them. MATILDA: Very nice! You've got knuckles on your hands. Use 'em next time you enter my caravan. Sorry, but as you can see, my hands are full. Why don't you make yourself at home? Thanks. I thought you might like a little company, so I brought round a bottle. I don't drink. In that case, you can watch me. - Do you make a habit of this? - Drinking? Coming to men's caravans at twelve o'clock at night. Only if I like them. I'm flattered, but you could have waited for an invitation. Well, I realise you're the elusive type, Frank. Women have to chase you, so here I am. And now that you've caught me? Isn't this a little dangerous? Doesn't it worry you that Lazlo might find out? At this moment, Lazlo is snoring away in bed. That's all he ever does do in bed. As much as I would like to, honey, I'm afraid I have to show you the door, and bid you good night. What's the matter, Frank? Don't you like me? I find you very attractive. It's just that you're peddling your merchandise at the wrong booth. You wouldn't say that to Monica Rivers. What the hell does she have to do with you? No need to be so rough, Frank. I was just trying to be friendly. Well, I hope your timing in your act is better than it is here. My timing is very good. You knock me out, Matilda. You really do. I get it. You're not worried about Lazlo finding out, are you? What do you mean? It's Monica you're afraid of. You've got to be kidding. Why should Monica worry me? I know all about you and her. - Who cares? - I do, for your sake. Well, that's nice of you. She's dangerous, Frank. Very dangerous. You may think you'll last forever, but you're wrong. - Just remember Dorando. - What are you getting at? He thought he was the only one in her life, too, and when she had no more use for him, she got rid of him. You'd better watch your mouth, Matilda. It could get you into trouble. I don't care. I'm not afraid of Monica, and she knows it. I say she killed Dorando, and one day I'm going to prove it. - You're crazy! - Am I? Just you remember what I said. And the next time she puts her arms around you, make sure those loving hands aren't carrying a knife. You loud-mouthed broad. Get out of here! Ohhh! Matilda, darling, you must be more careful of leaving like that. You'll damage your brain. (LAUGHING) You cow! I'll teach you to laugh at me. - Oh! Oh! - Oh, you... (GRUNTING) (OTHERS LAUGHING) GUSTAVO: Wanda! Wanda! You cow! And you! You'll get yours, too! Trouble-maker! All you do is make trouble. Wait till I get you to the caravan. RADIO: And now we play the new record from the Kenny Glen Group. Quite a party. Did you enjoy it? What are you talking about, Monica? Don't get any wrong ideas. Wrong ideas? Just because you've been entertaining a woman in your caravan in the middle of the night, dressed like that? Now use your head. You don't think I invited her in here, do you? - Yes! - Well, you're wrong. Matilda came in here unasked and uninvited, and I threw her out. After two hours! Right away. That's what the ruckus was all about. - Why? - Why what? Well, you're certainly no saint, and, er... she's attractive, in a common sort of way. Why did you throw her out? She started shooting her mouth off. About me? She's crazy. She thinks you murdered Dorando. And you? What do you think? You can trust me, Monica. (SQUELCHING) (ELEPHANT TRUMPETING) - BRUNO: It's supposed to be lucky. - I hope you're right. All the same, I shall watch where I walk in future. This your first time at a circus? Backstage, so to speak, yes it is. Thought so. You don't look like a circus man. And a circus man would never have trodden in elephant's... Yes, quite, quite. I'll try not to do it again. Are you looking for something? Yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Perhaps you can help me. - I want Miss Monica Rivers. - What for? - I beg your pardon? - You're not another reporter, are you? No, no, I'm not a reporter. We've been told to chase them off the lot if we see any. - I'll take you to Miss Rivers. - Thank you. Surprised, eh? Can't tell the difference when I'm behind that door. Do it all the time. Come on. (DOG BARKING) What's your name? Well, I have to introduce you, don't I? Can't just shove you through the door. No, of course you can't. I'm Detective Superintendent Brooks. - You're a detective? - Uh-huh. But we've had detectives here. I thought they'd finished. I'm from Scotland Yard. - (KNOCKING) - MONICA: Come in. Miss Rivers, there's a man to see you. Detective Superintendent Brooks. Well, show him in, Bruno. He's from Scotland Yard! - Good morning, Miss Rivers. - Good morning. - Bruno? - Yes? - Who's that? - You'd like to know, wouldn't you? - That's why I asked you. - Well, I'm not going to tell you. It's confidential. Don't give me that. You don't know who he is. You're just a messenger boy. Me, a messenger boy? I don't know, don't I! Well, I do, see? He's a detective from Scotland Yard, see! A Detective Superintendent. Sorry, Bruno, you did know, didn't you? But is all this questioning necessary? I've told the local police everything I know. And they've called in Scotland Yard, Miss Rivers. You'll agree there is still some areas that can stand clearing up. Like who the murderer is, for instance. Yes, yes, of course. Well, anything I can tell you. How long was Albert Dorando an associate of yours? - Seven years. - In what capacity? - Business manager. - Just business manager? What do you mean? Well, it sometimes happens that when two people work together for seven years, something more than a business friendship develops. Well, naturally, as you say, we did become good friends. Intimate friends? If what you are trying to find out is whether or not I slept with Dorando, the answer is no. BROOKS: I'm sorry I had to press the point, Miss Rivers. You'll understand that we cannot rule out a sex motive for the murder. Did Mr Dorando have any financial interest in the circus? None whatsoever. I own the circus, lock, stock and barrel. It's belonged to my family for fifty years. BROOKS: Has it always been successful? No, no. (CHUCKLING) No, no, there's nothing certain in show business. We've eaten caviar, and we've eaten sawdust. But I understand that since the death of Gaspar, business has been brisk. That's right. So it would be correct to say, Miss Rivers, that the circus, and therefore yourself, have gained financially from Gaspar's death. What are you insinuating? I'm not insinuating anything. I'm simply trying to establish a few facts. Now, is it true or not? Now, can you think of anybody... Why don't you come inside? I'm sure you'll find it warmer, and much more comfortable. Superintendent Brooks, may I introduce Frank Hawkins? Ah, yes, of course! You took over the Great Gaspar's spot, didn't you, Mr Hawkins? How opportune, as what I was about to ask Miss Rivers was: "could you think of anyone "who benefited from either of the two deaths?" You don't pull any punches, do you, Superintendent? Well, for your information, I wasn't even with the circus when Gaspar was killed. - Where were you, then? - On a train. - BROOKS: On a train. - FRANK: Travelling up to Leeds to see Miss Rivers, to ask about a job. That's rather strange, isn't it? You came to see about a job in a circus that already had a high wire act. Could anybody prove you were on that train? Then there's no proof that you didn't travel up the day before? Why should I lie? Whoever interfered with Gaspar's apparatus, Mr Hawkins, knew all about the rig. Knew just what to do, and how to do it, and he could climb up to the heights of the tent to carry out his work. Well, it wasn't me. Anyone could have climbed up there. That's right. Every man, woman and child in this circus has been trained to climb ropes and ladders. When the Big Top is raised, everybody helps. I see. Now if you've finished with your questions and decided not to arrest me yet, I'll go. I have a matinee to get ready for. There is one more question, Mr Hawkins. On the night that Dorando was killed, where were you? In my caravan. Asleep. I suppose there are no witnesses to that, either? I was alone. Where were you, Miss Rivers? I... I was here. I knew nothing about it until Bruno pounded on the door and woke me up. All right, Mr Hawkins, that's all for now. Don't plan any long trips away from the circus, for the time being. Will you want me any more? I, too, have a matinee. That's all, thank you, Miss Rivers. For the moment. Will you be here long? Until I find the murderer, and that brings me to my final request. Have you anywhere I could stay? Here on the circus grounds? Oh, no, there's very little available space. There is one place. Dorando's caravan. Do you have the keys? Thank you, Miss Rivers. (CYMBALS CLASHING) (CYMBALS CLASHING) (APPLAUSE) (WHIP CRACKING) (APPLAUSE) MONICA: And now, ladies and gentlemen, presenting Phyllis Allen, and her intelligent poodles. (WHISTLE BLOWING) - (DOGS BARKING) - (CHILDREN LAUGHING) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (BARKING) (APPLAUSE) (DRUMROLL) (APPLAUSE) (BAND SPEEDING UP) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) - You're late. - I'm sorry. Can I see you later? - Too busy. - I have to see you. Look, I have a million things to do. Payroll has to be made up, bills to be paid. Sorry, no time. Then you've got to make time. I've got to see you. Smile. You're on! (APPLAUSE) Bruno, will you come in now, please? - MATILDA: What did you tell him? - My lips are sealed. "My lips are sealed"! You stupid bag of bones! Well, I'll tell you one thing: mine aren't. Tell me, Bruno, after you heard the screams and the commotion, what did you do? I ran as fast as I could and woke up Miss Rivers. She was asleep, then? Oh, yes. I mean, I think so, 'cause I knocked five or six times. Where were you when you heard the screams? On the way back to my caravan from the canteen. I always have a late snack. Did you see or hear anything of a suspicious nature - before you heard the screams? - No, sir. Bruno, you must circulate a good deal round here. Can you think of any reason why anyone would want to murder Dorando? No. No. He really was a very nice manager. I could always get a little advance from him when I was short. (GIGGLING) - I mean, when I was short of money. - Yes, of course. Now you called Dorando the manager. Wasn't he also one of the owners? No, don't think so. Well, thank you very much, Bruno. That's all for now. Now, don't forget, if you see or hear anything that might help solve this crime, - you'll let me know, huh? - Oh, yes, Superintendent. Will you come in now please, er... madam? (HORSE WHINNYING) And what did you tell him? Or are your lips sealed, too? When you deal with the law, you should be careful and dignified, both of which you will find beyond your capabilities. I told you I was busy. I don't have time for eavesdroppers. I'll say one thing for you, Monica, you sure put on a clever performance for that detective. I put on a performance? What about you? You told him you were on a train the night of Gaspar's death. That's right. I was. Well, then, why did you tell me the first time we met that you saw Gaspar killed? I was only kidding. Don't you remember, you told me not to make any grisly jokes? But what about you? Didn't you tell me that Dorando was your partner? Yet I overheard you tell the Superintendent you owned the circus, lock, stock and barrel. What the hell has that got to do with you? With you, a man never knows where he stands. First you give, and then you hold back. I know you like to let men dangle. Well, that might have worked with Dorando, but it doesn't with me! You've got Dorando on the brain. He was my manager, and nothing more. - Oh, I know he was... - You know nothing! Monica, you're playing a dangerous game. Every lie is a trap. When Dorando was killed, I heard you say you were asleep. Well, I was in bed. Who should know that better than you? Well, after you eased me out, that must have been your shadow I saw run into Dorando's caravan. You're crazy! Don't deny it. I saw you. (MONICA SIGHING) Frank, what do you really want? I want a share in your circus. Let's say whatever Dorando owned, I want. (LAUGHING) Well, at last it's out in the open. I want us to be partners, Monica. Real partners. - So you want a share in my circus, huh? - That's right. All right, Frank, you've got it. - (KNOCKING) - Come in! - Angela! - Hello. Miss Burrows? Regrettably, Miss Rivers, I've had to bring back your daughter and deliver her right to your door. Oh, please don't be angry. I can explain. Excuse me, darling. Mr Hawkins, as you can see, an unexpected visit from my daughter and the head of her school. Of course. We can settle our business any time. And now, Miss Burrows, what exactly happened? - Please Mother, listen to me first. - Be quiet. You've always had a knack for causing trouble. Yes, Miss Rivers. You've just summed it up: trouble. Angela resists all discipline and supervision, and this is something we simply cannot tolerate. As you know, the Fenmore School for Young Ladies stands for character building, education and good breeding. Our reputation goes back seventy-five years. I'm well aware of your school and its reputation, Miss Burrows. That's why I enrolled Angela. Now, what exactly did she do? Broke all the rules. Refused to study. No obedience whatsoever. I myself have caught her smoking cigarettes, imitating her teachers in a most unflattering manner. Besides smoking cigarettes and a few harmless pranks, what else did she do? She upset the morale of other students. - Quite, quite distressing. - What do you mean? On one occasion, she stuffed pillows into her bed, rumpled up the blankets so that it looked as if she were asleep. And where was she? Later, she was found in a closet, giggling away. It was only a joke. You had the whole school in an uproar looking for you. If you had these problems with Angela, why didn't you contact me sooner? Miss Rivers, you're rather difficult to pin down. Your circus is constantly on the move. What is the position now? Your daughter has been expelled by the disciplinary board of the school. I'm sorry, Miss Rivers. We tried, but we failed. Angela is now your responsibility. I hope you have better luck. Good afternoon. Good day. Angela. Angela, what am I to do with you? Just let me stay here. I simply couldn't stand being away from you and the circus. I wanted you to have a fine education, meet people outside the world of the circus, make other friendships. It didn't work. I just don't belong with that group. Coming from the circus, I'm different from other girls. They made me feel like an outcast. Nobody really wanted to be my friend. You're just as good as they are. I was different. And on holidays when the other girls' parents came to visit them, - where were you? - I'm sorry, Angela. - I did try to get away, but I... - I know. You were too busy. I was lonely and miserable. I just wanted to die. I had no-one. I know. Please don't make me go away again. Let me stay here with you. With the circus. It's where I belong. After all, it's in my blood like it's in yours. Oh, darling, you certainly picked a bad time. You read, of course, about all the terrible things that have been happening here. I know. It's awful. I had nightmares thinking something might happen to you. Can I stay? All right, we'll try it for a while. I'll find somewhere for you to sleep and then, tomorrow, we'll look for something for you to do. And I mean work. Hard work. Thank you. You'll see, I'll work hard. - And a tomato, please. - Certainly. It's Angela! Bruno! Mmm. Hello. Romy! Mmm. How nice to see you. How well your beard looks. It's a new shampoo I use. Very successful. - When did you get back, Angela? - Today. - And how long are you staying? - Oh, for ever, I hope. - But what about your schooling? - I've left school. - Angela, darling. - Oh, hello Matilda. Did I hear you say you'd left school? Yes. Mother's giving me a job in the circus. What a shame you had to return at a time like this, when we have a homicidal killer amongst us. Matilda, darling, it's time we went. Good night, Angela. Try not to worry too much. After all, you have no cause to be afraid. What did she mean by that? Don't pay any attention to what Matilda has to say. I don't, but she's always been a troublemaker. I don't understand why you keep her here. They have a good act, but I may have to get rid of them if Matilda keeps on causing trouble. Coffee for me. I'm sure you'll be all right in the girls' quarters. Oh, of course I will. Good night. Angela? Oh! I'm sorry. Good night. Good night, darling. Bruno! I hope I didn't frighten you, Miss Rivers. Why you fool, you scared me half to death. - I didn't mean to. - You didn't mean to. I was on the way back to my caravan after seeing Miss Romy home, - and I saw you come out of the canteen. - So you followed me. Flitting from shadow to shadow like Jack the Ripper. I didn't mean to scare you. I wanted to talk to you about something. Don't be ridiculous at this time of night. Go to sleep! (APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, I now give you Ingemar the Fearless. (BAND PLAYING BOLERO) - (GROWLING) - (WHIP CRACKING) (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) Matilda! I left instructions for you to report to me in my caravan before you went on. - I was resting. - Not all of you. Your poisonous tongue, as usual, was very busy. And I know that you've been talking out of turn to the Superintendent. He asked me if I knew anything or saw anything, so I came right out and told him I suspect you. My mother has enough on her hands running this circus without you causing trouble for her. Angela, you're a very sweet child, but really, this is none of your business. Miss Rivers, my job makes it necessary for me to interrogate everyone who might be involved. Of course, I questioned Matilda, as I did you and many others. I'm not complaining about that, but I just won't have anybody in my circus filling you with a pack of lies. (APPLAUSE) You ready, Matilda darling? Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness one of the most dangerous and mystifying acts ever performed anywhere. Before your very eyes, Lazlo the Nonpareil, will saw a woman in half. (APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, now that you've had the pleasure of meeting me, let me present my beautiful and brave partner, Matilda. (APPLAUSE) Maybe she is too dumb to be frightened. Or maybe she trusts me completely. Anyway, every time she steps into this box, she whispers in my ear, "Lazlo, my life is in your hands." And believe me, it is! And now I need the assistance of two gentlemen from the audience. May I have some volunteers? Thank you, gentlemen. Er... you, sir and you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now may I ask you to tell the audience truthfully, - have I ever seen either of you before? - No. In other words, you are complete strangers to me. Yes, that's correct. Would you be kind enough to open up the doors on top, and in front? Matilda, darling, would you be reckless enough to step inside? You will observe, ladies and gentlemen, that she occupies the full length inside. Now, in full view of the audience, would you close the doors of the box. Thank you. Thank you. Bring down the saw. (RATTLING MACHINERY) Would you examine the teeth of the saw? (DRUMROLL AND BASS DRUMBEATS) (WHIRRING) (SCREAMING) So, you see, sir, after the two men from the audience had opened the box, Matilda climbed inside. The box was shut. The rotating saw was brought on, and applied to the centre of the box. Now at this point Matilda should have pressed this spring down here. Oh, what does that do? It operates this trap in the platform, which allowed her to sink her middle section so that, although her head and her feet were still exposed, her body was out of the way of the saw and free from danger. Well, what went wrong? The mechanism failed to work. Two screws had been removed from the hinges, here. The trap wouldn't operate, she couldn't sink her body, and, before she could signal to Lazlo, it was all over. So it couldn't possibly have been an accident. Definitely not. Have you questioned Lazlo? Well, he's in a state of shock and under heavy sedation. The doctor would only allow me three minutes with him. But from what he says, and from his record, he's performed this trick for eleven years without mishap. It was his custom to inspect the box personally before it was brought on. - Did he do so last night? - He swears he did. - Do you suspect anybody? - There's no lack of suspects, sir. For a starter, Miss Rivers. I heard her quarrelling with Matilda last night just before the wretched girl crawled into this coffin. They hated each other. Enough to murder? Your car's here to take you to the airport, sir. Thank you. I'll be right out. What about this Rivers woman? - Her husband was killed six years ago. - Killed? Yes, he was a trapeze artist here in the circus. There was an accident, and... This circus has a history of violent death. I checked up with the local police where the accident happened. They say it was a clear case of accidental death. However, I don't think Miss Rivers grieved for too long, because soon afterwards she cast off her widow's weeds and took up with Dorando. Now, she's involved with Frank Hawkins. Serious? I don't think so. She's a cool one. I'm sure she can seal off her love life if it gets in the way of her career. Her main drive is to run a successful circus. There's no doubt these deaths have given it a morbid glamour. Recent box office returns have been spectacular. Fill me in on this man you mentioned, Frank Hawkins. He, too, is definitely worth watching. I checked on his past. Found out he'd killed a man in Toronto, Canada two years ago. - Oh? - At the inquest the verdict was justifiable homicide. Self defence. Is there any evidence to connect him with what happened last night? - No, none at all. - What about Lazlo? Now that's a bit of a puzzle. Although there was no formal marriage, and Matilda was a bit of a flirt, they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet I found out that Lazlo had been gambling away their joint earnings. Maybe they quarrelled over that. I've had no time to check on that yet. Maybe one way to find out about all of them is to close down the circus. Er, if I may suggest... at this stage, we'd gain nothing by doing that. Shut the circus, and all my suspects scatter. This way, they all remain together, under my eye. All right, Brooks, I'll go along with you. Do you need any help? I'd rather work it alone. Very well. It's only a matter of two more days before the circus opens in London. Stay with it. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) All right, driver. See you in London. Monica, have you decided on my share yet? After we open in London, I'll have my lawyer draw up a contract. But the way I feel at the moment, you're only sharing trouble. Frank, I have an urge to get rid of the circus. Leave it and get rid of it. You can't do that. And, no matter how difficult things are, you've got to get a grip on yourself. I can't help it. I've got the jitters. I'm not made of stone. Look, all eyes are on you, Monica. How you act affects everybody. I always admired the cool, sure way you ran things. Well, it's getting to be more than I can handle, what with the police hounding me, and the performers scared and griping, and suspicious of each other. If you crumble, everything you've worked so hard to achieve will fall apart. You know, for the first time, it isn't enough. This circus is jinxed. It's becoming a nightmare. I keep wondering and thinking "who's next?" (THUDDING) What's going on here? Mother! Gustavo's taking me into his act. I'm sorry my knife frightened you, Miss Rivers. Frightened? I'm furious! Who gave you the right to make decisions around here? Where's Wanda, your regular partner? She's been drinking again. There is no stopping her. More and more, it is dangerous to work with her. Without a reliable partner, I shall have to cancel or... Not so fast! Then what should I do? Angela volunteered. I considered myself lucky. - I wanted to surprise you. - That you did. I want to work. You told me to. Maybe that's not a bad idea. Well, with Lazlo and Matilda out, you certainly are going to need Gustavo's act. Oh, please let me do it. You're not lying about Wanda? Go see for yourself. She'll barely make it today. About the future, I let you make the decision. All right. I'll check details with you later. And I want to see this act before we open in London. Thanks. Just one warning, darling. The hazards of the act are nothing compared to the dangers built into Gustavo. He thinks he's a throwback to Casanova and Don Juan. You flatter me, Miss Rivers. But believe me, nothing is further from my mind. Keep it that way. You look beautiful, Romy. I always dress up for the big party. I remember how you looked last year. You absolutely sparkled. One thing I like about coming to London is the celebration Miss Rivers gives us. All you can eat and all you can drink. Yeah, we can forget all our troubles and concentrate on having a good time. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go. (BIG BAND JAZZ) Monica. Excuse me. To you. Here's hoping you banished the jinx. I'll drink to that! You were certainly right not to cancel the party. Everybody's enjoying themselves. When people are troubled, give them a celebration. You know, the French Revolution could have been avoided if Louis XVI had done that. Don't forget what happened to Marie Antoinette. But I have you to protect me. And now, ladies and gentlemen, a big surprise. A number from our own group.

Monica, I don't want to pressure you, darling, but... did you talk to your lawyer? It's all arranged. You'll have 25% of the circus, and 100% of me. ...and for the last part of our vacation, we'll visit Copenhagen, Berlin and Madrid. I'll help you choose the acts for our next season. It sounds wonderful. They make a handsome couple. I think she's too old for him. Well, he doesn't think so, and that's what matters. Your mother will never grow old. She has the gift of eternal youth. I'm famished. - Would you get us some food? - Sure. Angela, you're not dancing. Aren't you enjoying yourself? You seem to be doing it for the whole family. Ha. Anything wrong with that? I heard what your plans are with lover boy Frank. I was hoping that we could go away together when the season ends. Just the two of us. Angela, may I remind you that you made the decision to stay here. Yes, I wanted to stay, because I still hoped I had a mother. But it's funny, all my memories of "mother" are of teachers and other people who brought me up. I was shunted around from place to place like a piece of baggage with the wrong address pasted on it. But you certainly never lacked anything. No, except what I needed most. You. - (BAND FINISHES NUMBER) - (APPLAUSE) May I join you? Please. Superintendent... I hope that you're aware that we're all still jittery and under tremendous tension. I have an eerie feeling that the killer will strike again any moment. That's quite understandable, particularly in a place like a circus where everyone has freedom of movement. Two elements govern a killer: motive and opportunity. Here, there are all kinds of opportunities. What about motives? You have to have a reason for killing. Of course. Some are obvious, aren't they? Like immediate gain or revenge. Some are strange, subtle, difficult to define. What steps have you taken for tomorrow night's opening? I'll show you, Miss Rivers. On special instructions from Commissioner Dalby, your opening night will be covered like this. We'll have Scotland Yard men stationed all round the grounds at strategic points. At the animal pens, the caravan lines, the canteens, all the exits and entrances. And of course, we'll have men mingling with the audience and also backstage. Believe me, Miss Rivers, every precaution possible, to prevent anyone or anything marring the performance, will be taken. But your men backstage, they won't... (THUNDERCLAP) (BAND PLAYS LIVELY OVERTURE) (APPLAUSE) (ELEPHANT TRUMPETING) (HORSE WHINNYING) You ready, Angela? I can guarantee that. Good luck to you. To both of you. Ladies and gentlemen!

(APPLAUSE) (DRUMROLL) (THUDDING) (THUDDING) (THUDDING) (THUDDING) (THUDDING) (THUDDING) (THUDDING) (THUDDING) (APPLAUSE) And now, a spectacular act that has been thrilling audiences everywhere on our tour.

He will stand on a chair while balancing on the wires sixty feet above the steel bayonets. (DRUMROLL) (APPLAUSE) (GASPING) (MASSED SCREAMING) I had to kill him. I had to kill them all. I had to destroy your circus. It murdered my father, and now it's taking you away from me. Kill! Kill! Kill! That's all I feel inside me. Mother, I gave you one last chance, but now you've turned against me. I've got to kill you! MONICA: Angela! Angela! (TWO THUNDERCLAPS) Get those cables out of the way.
