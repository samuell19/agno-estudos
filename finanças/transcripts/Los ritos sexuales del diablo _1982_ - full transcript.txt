The devil's paw. What's wrong? Fiona. British Airways to Bologna, flight number BA526, gate number 19. Last call. British Airways to Bologna, Flight number BA526, gate number 19, gate 109, last call. Well, you're back home again. Yes. Do you really think it's a good idea to be put up by your sister-in-law in the country? Why not? My brother and I lived there as children, and he died at the place. It'd still be better in a hotel. And expensive, too, you know. Yeah, but I came here to see London. The house of my brother's near the city. We can go to London as often as you like, Robert. Look, there are our bags. Robert believes he's going to be kept prisoner in the house. Don't believe everything Carol tells you. Don't worry, I know Carol. Tell me, how long are you going to stay in England? A few days. I've got to return to my work. That goes for me. Short stay. You're both very busy I see. Yes, we are, Fiona. And what do you do, Robert? Professor of Latin. Oh, how interesting. You think so? I shouldn't drive faster in this weather. I'm sorry about the time we're taking, but the side roads in England are very narrow. I wouldn't worry about it, Carol's asleep. - A cigarette? - No thanks. I smoke a pipe, Fiona. Shall I? There you are. Do we have much to go? No, we're almost there. This fresh air makes me so sleepy. Oh, that's an old wives tale. What's wrong? No electricity. Wouldn't you know it. This is always happening. Maybe it's the fuses. No, I don't think so. I bet the line is down. Why don't we go into the kitchen, light some candles. Yes, good idea. Through here. It's a terrible night out. It's been like this all summer long. I'm not surprised that so few people live around here. The house has changed. Yes, I like things old-fashioned. Tomorrow, I'll show you the house, Carol. Why do you have all these candlesticks? Looks like an antique shop. I'm very fond of candlelight. It makes things intimate. You know, I think Fiona's very romantic. It's just that I prefer natural things to artificial ones. And why do you have all these black candles? What do you think they're for, Carol? What I mean is, black is so dreary. Yes, but I like these. What would you like to drink? - Drink? - I don't have any tea or coffee or anything that's hot, so it'll have to be alcohol. Oh, that's what I wanted anyway. Aren't you cold? Why don't we light a fire in the chimney? Of course, everything's set to go. Well, I'll do it. Well now, what would you like to drink? What do you have? Whisky, gin, vodka. Whisky for me. Let's see, cognac, sherry, but there's no ice. Oh, it's doesn't matter. I'll have a glass of sherry, please. You're more beautiful now than the last time you were here. Thank you. I think you've lost a little weight. You think so? Perhaps a little bit, don't know. You remind me of your brother, more every day. There's a family resemblance, only on the outside. You have a better character. But they tell me the contrary. Oh, they're wrong. I was looking at these lithos. They're very interesting. They're simply reproductions. They were never in this house before. No? No, I don't think so. Are you interested in demonology? Only certain angles. I find all those things abominable. I don't reject anything out of hand. That attitude is more intelligent. Persons of importance are continuously making pacts with the devil. Drew and I were always discovering interesting things during the last few years. Even though your sister-in-law does seem a little eccentric, she's nice when you get down to it. Fiona can be enchanting, when she wants. Well, she was today. Yes, I know how she acted. Hey, what's the matter with you? Me, nothing, why? I don't know, you've seemed nervous since we arrived here. I would like to know what she insinuated about my brother having discovered very interesting things during the last few years when referring to those horrendous reproductions in the living room. And what about the black candles? Yeah, they are a little strange. I'm thinking about a book on witchcraft I read many years ago. In their gatherings, they always use black candles. Maybe your sister-in-law is a witch, and you never knew about it. At any rate, when the devil tempted Eve, he found his first willing servant. At least, that's what the good book says. And that's why all you women are a little bewitched. It's easy to see you spent too long in the seminary. They corrupted you there. I simply can't imagine my brother living in this atmosphere. What are you talking about? You mean those reproductions and the black candles? Don't you think you're exaggerating a bit, Carol? Drew couldn't have been a student of the occult. He was delightful and carefree. You know, totally open. When was the last time you saw your brother? Not long ago, one year. A person can change in that time. No, Andrew, no. Robert, don't. No, I don't feel like it. What are you doing here, Carol? I just had such a fright. What happened? You might think I'm still half asleep, Fiona, but I just saw a bearded man through the window. I bet you think I've had a nightmare. I believe you did. Who's going to be out there in the middle of the night? I don't know, but I saw him. Carol, apart from a few eccentric foreigners who live around here, I can assure you that this zone is the safest in the county. I'll get you a tea, then upstairs to rest. You look very tired. What's wrong? Do you smell incense? It's this. Is that tea? They're homegrown herbs, really very beneficial for nervous conditions. She's Drew's sister, right? Yes, and she saw you. I'm sorry. You should be prudent, Reverend. If she suspects, we might have serious headaches. Why is she here? Probably to arrange the last details of the inheritance, Reverend. Her lawyers in London will take care of it. What happens if she finds out what we did to her brother? How would she find out? Drew spoke too much toward the end. He was very foolish. I know it. That's why we had to kill him. There are many who hate us. And who also fear us. Don't worry about those things. Who's accompanying her? Her friend, but there's no problem there, I think. But I beg you, Reverend, please, leave. She could still be awake. The autumn equinox is near, when we celebrate the sabbath. They shouldn't be here! They'll have gone by then. Let me take care of it all, okay? Why don't you go, and, tomorrow, we'll speak about it. Through here. It's 10 o'clock. It's rather late to get up. Do you like jam? It's strawberry, conserved here. Thanks. Thanks yes or thanks no? Thanks yes. You may use my car to go to London. It will be easier for all if we took the train. As you wish. There's a train every hour. How long does it take to get to London? Oh, about half an hour. The express is even faster. Fiona, I'd like to visit Drew's grave. All right, we can go now, I'll accompany you. It isn't far. Thank you. You don't have to go, unless you like. I'll see you in an hour or two. All right. I think your brother has achieved eternal rest. Did he suffer? No, it happened very quickly. All of a sudden, a man who is very active left us forever. When the doctor showed up to sign the death certificate, I was asked if I agreed on the certification of embolism, or if I requested an autopsy. Well, I accepted the first of the two, Carol, because an autopsy wouldn't do anything. Carol. Carol, leave here forever. What's the matter? Where did you get that? Do you like it? You little whore. When I saw you up in the house, I knew you were doing something. What the fuck are you up to? Careful, you son of a bitch, and worry about the animals. It's the only thing you're good for. Witch, fucking witch you are. One day, you'll be discovered, and they'll lynch us like in medieval times. Ah, don't be afraid, you fool. Nothing will happen to you. If the folks around here only knew- - Yeah? Those in our coven are important. Haven't you found out yet? Go and tell that renegade Reverend to show here tonight, and to bring that bitch along, well prepared for what's waiting for her. Not these herbs again. You drank them last night. Be a good girl. I take them all the time. It stinks all over the house. What is it? I don't know exactly the name of the plant. I was given these herbs long ago. Drink it. It's really awful. When you're accustomed to it, you'll drink it every day. Drew wrote me a strange letter before he died. I hadn't planned mentioning it, but now I think it's better if we talk about it. He told me in the letter that he was unhappy and afraid. He didn't go into detail. The letter was ambiguous, seemed like it was written in a hurry. What caught my attention was that the handwriting was different. Did he say any more? No. I told you, his letter was ambiguous. Besides, the letter itself was very brief. Just a note. A desperate message. It was a letter from a terrified man. Aren't you dramatizing a bit? I didn't want to speak about this matter earlier, but there are questions that should be resolved. What are they? I prefer that you and I speak honestly so that we can trust each other. Of course. Well, no, we really hated each other, if that's what you want to know. I suspected that in your relationship. Oh, yes? Well now. Yes, but your life together doesn't interest me. Your brother was an alcoholic, plastered day and night. His career was beginning to go downhill. I'm not surprised that his handwriting had changed. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. It doesn't matter. Better to forget it all, and start over. You'd better stop that or you'll get him too excited. Exactly what I want to do. What can I do for you? Your husband isn't around, you know. Keep your hands off, this is important. You've heard of the evil eye, haven't you? It's bad luck. No, you don't really know about those things. I've heard a little, but they're all stories. Stories, huh? I'm sure you've never seen a Billy goat mounting a woman and later coming inside her. No, never. Well, wait until tonight, and you will see it. You'll see how the goat fucks her, and, after, with the sperm of the beast, I'll show you how to prepare a potion that can murder Peter. Spread your legs wide so that the goat can enter you. Your juices must mix to make the needed potion. It's hurting me. It's all right, don't be afraid. Nothing will happen to you. It'll be all right, that's it, that's it. Doesn't it feel good? Yes, that's it. Carol. Carol. Carol. Carol. Carol. Carol. Carol. Your brother was one of our best lawyers, Carol, and a personal friend. We were all terribly affected by his sudden death. We don't know what could've pushed Andrew to drink. It was inexplicable, because everything happened so rapidly. I told him once he should cut down on his drinking or it would ruin his career. And it was truly a pity because he was incredibly successful. You see, Andrew was our best lawyer. Sometimes, we kidded him about his unnaturally good fortune, telling him that he a had a pact and secret with the devil. Do you know Fiona? Naturally, my dear. A woman who is bewitching and charming. They were the perfect couple. Did he ever refer to a diabolic sect? No. But I'd like to be frank. Your brother seemed to be very frightened. Here's his last will and testament. Everything's in order. Thank you. Needless to say, anything you may need of me, you may rest assured you have a friend at your complete disposal. Thank you, Mr. Connor. It's wonderful I can count on friends like you. - Nice seeing you again. - Goodbye. Say hello to Fiona for me. What's wrong? A little dizzy. It's best if you sit down for a little while. I'll have my secretary make you a little tea. This is the odor you can smell throughout the house, isn't it? Does it bother you? No, now I've gotten used to it. Have you never heard speak of Mandragora? Yes, it's the plant that the witches used for their magic potions in the Middle Ages. So they say. This is. And this one is. You're an expert botanist. I'm only interested in a few strange seeds for making teas. I like curative herbs. And lethal ones. Them, too. This is, that in England we call foxglove. You say it's lethal? No, it's completely inoffensive. This is my favorite one, purple berries. What are they for? To make languid lovers more ardent. Aphrodisiac. Do you have any marijuana around here? Oh, no. I'm really stupid. I could've made a fortune if I'd wanted to, Robert. I hope I'm not boring you with all these stories. If you'd have gone to London with Carol, you wouldn't be bored. I'm okay right where I am, in the midst of these herbs, and with your stories, as you call them. Thank you. And, besides, this is a very busy day for Carol. I think that London and its museums can wait. How did you get to know Carol? It was by chance, as happens in the majority of the cases. It was shortly after I got out of the seminary. You were in a seminary? Yes, I was fed up when they ordained me. Well then, this place should seem like a revelation to you, with its allusions to the devil. No, you're mistaken. Satanism is an offshoot of Christianity now. I studied the question for nine years, So you can imagine I do know all there is to know. You're not an exorcist. No. If we think about all those fallen angels and their representatives on Earth, you have to admit that submission to the Church was imposed on us. Submission to the devil was our own free choice. I think that's how witches and warlocks first came about. The first Satanists. The idolaters of evil. But good and evil are only words. Only our instincts tell us what we want to know. What's wrong with you? You're becoming hysterical. I tell you, Robert, I brought that necklace with me. You know, the one I like so much. I'm sure I put it in my luggage. Someone has stolen it. Are you sure? Probably you've left it at home. Something's wrong here, Robert. There are too many things happening in this house that I don't understand. The black candles, my dizziness, and the face I saw through the window the first night, and now my necklace has disappeared. What are you insinuating? There are such phenomena as malevolent powers that are able to influence an individual against his will, Robert. The people who wield those powers require a garment or a favorite article of the person they wish to influence. You're really serious, aren't you? Of course I am because I believe that there are forces that we are unable to perceive. What kind of forces? Occult. The occult. I believe that I'm an open-minded man, Carol. But, today, witches and warlocks aren't burned at the stake. Witches and wizards have disappeared. They burned them in the Middle Ages, and they weren't witches, just hysterical females. And all those strange things I have observed since we arrived? Any person who is really normal would call them a coincidence. I don't think they're a coincidence. At least not that kind, Robert. You're very immature if that's your reaction, Carol. They still hold black masses or whatever they call those gatherings of maniacs. I won't stop until I find out what happened to my brother. Well, if you let your nerves run away with you, you'll really become sick. I'm not sick! They're nerves. And when your nerves get the best of you, you should try to relax them. And my dizziness? Take tranquilizers. And Fiona's teas are good for you. It's the best thing you can do. And, if I were you, I'd stay in bed today. You're in very good hands. She's suspicious, what do you think? We decided you'd take care of everything. I'm trying to. So what's going on? Nothing's going on! She just doesn't trust me and she has a will of her own. We must find another way of dealing with her. It wouldn't be advisable to have her drugged indefinitely, Fiona. Yes, I told you that. Well, we need a quick solution that doesn't arouse suspicions. I don't think we should resort to violence. I think the police would see a connection with the death of her brother. We need to think of another way of dealing with Carol. Go ahead. Confuse her mentally, a state of agitation that would make her commit actions that, afterwards, she would completely reproach herself for. She would prefer to leave and forget about it all. You're right, you know. And if she tells the police? I think it'll be too late for any suspicions. The best thing would be a mysterious ailment, Doctor. An illness that's hard to diagnose. An unexpected stroke, like her brother, but once she's far away. And her boyfriend? Yeah, what do we do with him? He says he's defrocked, an ex-priest, a nonbeliever, you know. I will handle him. Repeat after me. I renounce my Christian baptism. I renounce it. Glory to Satan, master of the world. Glory to Satan, the Antichrist. And now you're one of us. And now I am one of you. And now you are one of us. And now you are one of us. Hey, Carol, it's about time you got up, sleepyhead. Hey, it's almost 11, you know. Get up! We didn't come here to sleep, come on. Time for breakfast. What time is it? I told you, it's almost 11. Oh, Fiona's herbs are gonna be the death of me. What's wrong, aren't you feeling well? Why are you dressed? I returned from London. I spent the night in a hotel. You were in London all last night? I missed the damn train. When I called on the telephone, no one answered. I thought you might be sleeping, and I decided to spend the night in a hotel. Expensive. You could've got a taxi. It was too complicated, and I wasn't sure how to get here. It might've ended disastrously. You smell. Thank you. I'm serious. It really stinks, you know? Sulfur, that's it! What are you sniffing at? You look like a rabbit. Ah, here she is at last. Carol, I'd like to present you to all these nice people who've come for tea and are so anxious to meet you. Reverend Hooper and his goddaughter little Annaliese. She's such a bright student of architecture. Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales. And Dr. Gaunt. Carol, you seem to look better today. What is it? - Why not? - 'Cause I don't like it. We've never done this before. Leave me alone! - Well. Leave me alone! Robert! Leave me alone, Robert, please. Don't be a cunt. Relax, enjoy it. Don't be so fucking prudish, you little shit. Your crucifix? Yeah, you're right. I don't know what became of it. I must've lost it. You don't seem bothered about it. It could've fallen in the bed, or in the shower. Why in the hell are you worried about it? Well,. Sometimes you're a fucking drag. I'm sorry if that's the way you feel about it. Don't take it that way. So, I was disagreeable. I'm sorry I got carried away. You've changed, you know. You're not the same person. It's not possible. I don't understand. What's wrong with you? It was wrong bringing you here. Robert, why don't we leave for London? You know that would offend, Fiona, Carol. To hell with Fiona and all those weird friends, the people who hang around her. They're like a bunch of vultures. They're very nice persons, Carol. Nice, you believe they're nice persons? They've put me off always, watching, and so quiet. And that Reverend. Every time he's around, I get nervous. Observing me, as if I were naked. Maybe he likes you. Oh, no. Not bad taste, you know? When I think about him, I get nauseous. Poor man, he believes you're cute. Have you seen his fingernails? I think that one of them looks like a claw, an evil bird of prey. I don't like your teas, I don't need them, and I'm convinced they're not good for me. Dr. Gaunt recommended them, you know. I realize that, but I don't want any. Well, why don't you drink this one that I just prepared? Well, all right, I'll drink it later. Fiona, there's a big door underneath the stairs. I suppose it's a passage to the cellar. Yes. It's closed, you know. I believe so. Is there any thing in the cellar? What a question, Carol! What you always find in cellars, heating systems, water pipes, and old odds and ends. Why did you circle this date on the calendar? That's when autumn starts. At the beginning of every new season, I normally get together with a few friends to have a party, and, by the way, you're invited to one we're having tomorrow. Aren't you dressing for dinner? Yes. What's wrong today is that people are completely crazy, inventing ailments that really don't exist. Everyone suffers from something. In the majority of cases, it's simply psychosomatic. Our century is one of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts. But I think we should return to the olden times. We should get back to nature and eat what our great-grandparents did. Take herbs, for instance. Robert! Don't be afraid of me. I'm not going to do anything. Let go of me. You're one of them. Let go of me. Everything is okay, it's okay. Carol, it's a new dimension that's unknown to us. It's marvelous. Why don't we leave? We'll go away form here. This is a nightmare, I think. I beg you, Robert, in the name of God! You know that God is nothing more than a metaphor, just pageantry that's slowly losing its appeal. I don't know how they poisoned you, Robert. You've changed. Don't leave. Robert-- I need you. You can escape from all this. You planning on going somewhere? Leave, where to? That's crazy. This bitch is in heat. I'm suffering. What are you waiting for? Fuck me now. You're drunk. I want it right now. Now, now! If you won't do it, Peter will do it. Peter! - Where are you going? Peter! Come here! I need to get it off with you! Get over there! Peter! Peter! Where are you? Peter, Peter, make love to me. Give it to that bitch. And you know how you are when you get drunk. Go home. When I want, I can finish, with all this crap. Oh, you're making threats, huh? I'd be careful if I were you. You are the ones that should be careful because, if I feel like it, I can send you all to prison for the rest of your lives. All of you. John, where are you going? What's it to you, bitch? John! Robert? Robert? If he hears, he'll kill us. They're watching me. - Who? - Trust me. There's no time for explanations. Get out of here before they do the same to you as they did to your brother. Are you referring to Fiona and her friends? - Yes, yes, yes. She's a witch like the rest of them. They all are. If I were you, I'd get out of here, but don't go to the police. They'd laugh. They have accomplices everywhere. I would advise a priest. He's the only one who can help you. He's a servant of God. Do as I say. But what about Robert? I refuse to leave him here. I believe you've lost him forever. He's one of them. Be free while you still have time. Let me go! Put him on the table. Clear off there. Don't do it! No, no. There he is. We'll settle with this pig. Finish him off. What are you going to do? Georgina, Georgina, don't do it. I don't want them to kill me! No, please. No! I will tell no one. I will swear, I will say nothing. No, I don't want him to kill me. No, no, no! No, no, no, no! No, no. You bitch, stay there! That's enough, don't slap her anymore. You won't cause any more problems, will you? You witch, you'll pay for this. You poisoned my brother. I know you did. You're going to be Satan's bride. Our Lady of the Sabbath. You, mix up the potions. And you two, prepare her, undress her. The sabbath is an orgy of wickedness, in which all the instincts are given free reign. Annaliese, I would like you to initiate Carol in our coven. Satan, come to us. Satan, come to us. This is a great moment. This is your hour, Carol. Are you ready to be possessed by your master? Satan, you are the divinity. My body's burdening me. He's ripped me apart! Satan's possessing you. Our Lady of the Sabbath. You'll feel wondrous pleasures as he enters you and consumes you as he leaves. After the pain, you'll experience ecstasy. You'll scream with pleasure. Robert. You were asleep, huh? We're here. Did you have a nice rest? - Yes, yes, thank you. - It's a terrible night. Oh, no. Well, there are no lights. They go out every time it rains, you know. Could it be the fuses? No, I think the lines are down. We'll go into the kitchen and light some candles. It almost looks like we're going to celebrate rites to the devil. Could be, who knows? What is it? You're shivering. Did you catch cold? It was when you were asleep in the car. What's wrong? Don't you feel well? I have some very special herbs. I cultivate plants that can bring you relief. No, no, I feel okay, thank you. Did I frighten you? He's my uncle, Reverend Hooper. I was awake, and I heard your car. A nice trip? Very good, thank you.
