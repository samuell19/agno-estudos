THE ENCHANTED ISLAND I looked to the horizon without hope of salvation... ...I was constantly fighting to survive... ...in this island, against all odds... ...far away from civilization... ...I thank God... ...to send me a human being... ... whose I can share my life. Since Friday's arrive my life has been so calm... ...that if I wasn't afraid of savages... ... I won't leave this island. My little friend. He started to talk very clearly. He knew the name of every thing... Every day, he showed me his simple and tender nature. I started to love him deeply since the first day. I taught him the principles... ...of Catholic religion. Master, God is powerful than Devil, isn't he? So, why he doesn't kill him to avoid him to do evil? Master, why God doesn't kill Devil to stop him? God doesn't kill when we offend him with our sins. He allow us to live to regret about them... ...and to obtain His forgiveness. So, God forgive everybody, even the Devil? Can God forgive the Devil? God is almighty. So, if God forgive everybody, then Devil is not bad. Master! Master! A snake! A snake! Master! Master! Friday spent the whole day giving thanks to the rifle... ...to save his life and ask it wouldn't kill him. And to forgive him like God had forgiven the Devil. Walking with Friday around my kingdom... ... was so funny that we spent days and nights... ...so happy and delighted that we couldn't believe... ...that such joy could exist. Island inhabitants contemplated our hikes... ...that were necessaries to save the freedom... ...of this piece of land. My duty as a governor was to protect... ...citizen Friday's life and also the other inhabitants. We could see the power of God... ...in the beauty of the landscape... ...and Their force was with us in this savage land... ...as if we were in the most fancy street of England. We never discussed or argued about religion... ...Iike we use to do in the civilize world... ... their doctrines, structures and laws... ...had not any importance to us. I thought it should be the same for all human king. We had the most important guidance to go to Heaven: God's words. Thanks to this, we felt the presence of His spirit... ... that guide us towards the Truth... ...and made us to live under the Holy Book precept's. What could we do with all the knowledge... ...of the world, if we were alone... ...in this isolated island, far away of men? We built this canoe in order to follow the river's course... ...that finished at the other side of the island... ... where, as Friday said... ... we could see his homeland. We started a dangerous and glorious adventure... ...in our little boat. Nevertheless this disaster... ... I was glad that only the birds and monkeys... ... were the only witness of this shipwreck. If this were happened in York Harbor... ...in front of my countryman... ... I'd preferred to get drown. We decided to climb that part of the island... ...because it was the shorter way to arrive... ... to the other coast. I remembered that Friday told me that if our God... I remembered that Friday told me that if our God... ...could hear us up beyond the Sun... ...he must be greater than his Benamuckee... ... who lived not too far from them... ...and yet could not hear, until they climb up... ...to the great Mountains where he dwelt... ...to speak to him. Master! There is my nation, my country! Master! Master! There is my country! My nation! There it is! There it is! Master! There it is! My nation! My country! It didn't go! It didn't go! Master! Friday. Do you want to come back to your country? Yes, Master. I'm glad to go back to my country. What will you do? To eat human meat and to live like a savage? No. Friday tell them to live good... ...to pray God, to eat bread... ...animal meat, milk... No eat man anymore. Master! I don't want to go to my country! Why? Because they kill me and eat me. I'd prefer to go to your nation. They don't eat man. Yes, Friday. Yes, my son. Everyday the island seemed to me bigger and majestic... ...because in this season the river-bend's grown up... ...and water's torrent gave us an amazing show. In a human selfish... ...I was very proud to be the owner of this wonders. I didn't care to take the long way... ... I wanted that Friday see the cascade... ... that was in the center of the island... ... which water had made more rich his nature... ...surrounded it with a great variety of plants... ...and different species of animals. Here was where I thought to build my shelter. I thought a lot about this project... ...because this place had a lot of possibilities... ...but when I thought carefully about it... ...I realized that my house was near of the sea... ... where I could see my rescuers... ...nevertheless the low possibilities... ...that it could happen. To go to this place meant to extend my captivity. The long journey got tired Friday, who continued... ...over my shoulders. Master! Snake! When I saw the serpent, I realized that Friday... ... was in great danger, because it was the same kind... ...that bitted one of my goats, who died few hours later. Hang on, I have to extract the poison. No more, Master! Please! No more, master! I must do it, my son. I have to cauterize the wound. I thought that if the serpent bitted me instead of Friday... ...I had more chances to survive, because I was an adult. We never appreciate what have... ...until we lost it. With the same anguish that a thirsty... ...beg for a glass of water... ...I begged for Friday's health. Fever didn't get down, on the contrary... ...it increased every moment. I was ready to die, but not to see Friday pass away. I felt how fear invaded body. Had God forgot me? Why he didn't hear my begs and pleas? Why he wanted to take me off the only companion I had. I blasphemed for the first time in my life. Even I wanted to call de Devil... ...I wanted to sell my soul for Friday's life. I remembered God... . ...thank to him I was still alive... So, I raised my eyes to Heaven and prayed with devotion. I didn't know if I done it because I loved Friday so much... ...or because I was so afraid to be alone. Master... Friday recovered very fast. I'm sure that he would finish... ...all our stock if he could. He was a gluttonous kid, her appetite had no end. When Friday recovered completely... ...and after we thank the Lord, we started... ...to look for a bigger tree, in order to make... ...a canoe more big and resistant than the old one. That one? No, master. That's not good. That one will sank like the other one. Come. Look, Master! Parapo! Same canoe I have. Come! One month after, we finished the canoe. I had to accepted that Friday was right... ...about the tree, we made a great boat. I prayed God that this canoe.... ... wouldn't finish like the other one. This will no sank! We can go to you country... ...when we get good wind. I found two pieces which appeared pretty good... ...and with these I went to work... ...and with a great deal of pains... ...and awkward tedious stitching... ... we at length made a three cornered ugly thing... ...Iike what we call in England... ...a Shoulder of Mutton Sail... ... to go with a boom at bottom. I had to teach Friday how to sail on the canoe. He was amazed about the way I controlled it... ... with the helm and how I managed the course... ...and route changing sails direction. He was deeply impressed. Some time later, everything was familiar for him... ...and he became a great sailor. I'm pretty sure that every boy in the world... ... would be delighted driving our great boat. I had passed almost 27 years exile in this island... ... and three since I meet Friday. This day, I celebrated an anniversary of my shipwreck... ...but I also thank God that he had mercy with me. I was convinced that I won't pass another year... ... in this island. While I was collecting our provisions... ...for the journey, Friday, as we used to do... ... every week, went to the beach... ... in order to hunt some turtles. Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! They... In beach... They arrive! They arrive! They arrive! Where they had disembarked last time... ... was not the same where they arrived... ... when they brought Friday. If I weren't with him I would run away... ...to the forest. But I must encouraged him, I had to defend... ...my island and my citizen's life. It's them! They'll eat me! Don't be afraid, my guns will fright them. I saw another group of cannibals... ... who were in the other side of the island... ...ready to get a terrible banquet. I was so disgusted with their savage practices... ...that I decided to attack and kill them one by one. Come, Friday. We must surprise them... We must go for the weapons. When I was running towards the shelter... ...I thought what would be easy: Should we wait until they find our shelter... ...or should we surprise them to avoid a reaction... ... of their side? But what would happen... ...if they react furiously against us? We'll have not chance to survive to their attack. I decided to use my whole arsenal. I gave Friday a gun and a rifle... ...and I carried the rest of the weapons on my back. I'm still anguish that Friday could be caught... ...and devoured by his fellow man. But I was sure that I was doing the right thing. I was certain that God won't leave me alone... ...and I begged Him to give me the strength... ...to fight and never let us down on this. While we approached, many doubts passed... ...on my mind, making weak my faith... ...and my resolution. I wasn't afraid about my enemies... ... who was naked and unarmed. I was superior to them even if I was alone. I wondered why I have this obsession to fight... ...and cover my hands in blood. This reflections made me approach to them... ... very carefully and do what God inspired me to do... ...and look them to enjoy his bloody banquet... ...and no interrupt them. I got petrified when I realized... ...that their next victim was a white man. I stand on end and I felt the same emotion... ...that I had when I found human footprints. -Do exactly what I do. -Yes, master. -Are you ready? -Yes, master. Fire in the name of God! When I noticed the man was alive... ...I felt the blood running thought my veins... ...and I wished to kill the other cannibals. But they were far away. No! He thought I was going to kill him. Master! Master! It's my father! It's my father! My father! He's my father, master! He's my father! As soon as I gave my guests some rest and shelter... ...I would take charge of their survival. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Calm down. Get some rest. I wanted to see and talk with a white man since ages... ...and now that I have the chance to do it... ...I asked him to be calm and quiet. Friday told me his father was hungry... ...he maybe thought we were going to eat... ...the cannibals that some time before... ...almost devour him. At the begging he complained because we didn't kill... ... their fellow man, but soon... ...he got used to eat goat beef. I'm Friday. He's Master. He's Father. And you? I'm your friend. Your Friend? I'll be your friend forever. No. You're Friday too because you arrived... ...in a canoe, like me and Master saved you, like me. Yes. I'm like you and your father... ...because he saved the three of us. My island suddenly became inhabited... ...and I look myself rich and with citizens. Sometimes I made jokes about being a king... ...but now I really become one. Suddenly I realize my responsibilities... ...and I asked myself: "What would happen... ...if the savages came back with help... ...and we couldn't confront them? I kept an eye on the coast where the cannibals came... ...I'm pretty sure they were going back. But I also thought they were afraid... ...about the power of our weapons... ...and they were convinced that we are demons... ...or heaven forces that come to earth... ...to destroy them and they didn't dare to come. We lived anguished for a long time... We scrutinized the horizon, it represented before... ...a source of hope and survivor... ...and now I see it with fear... ... waiting to look cannibals' canoes. Master! Master! Master! Master! We were scared to death when we saw Friday... ...screaming and running because we thought... ...he had saw cannibals. We didn't realize that he actually fought... ...against the ants that he had into her trousers! Despite all those accidents... ... we were always awake... ...ready to fight against those savage... ...even if we die in the battle. My three vassals were completely loyal to me. For them, I was her savior they owed me their lives... ...and they were be ready to sacrifice it for me. I'm pretty sure that any marshal would be proud... ...of their discipline and obedience. We tried many defense strategies... ... to defend ourselves against our enemies... ...and they were ready to fight. But, would they dare the courage to do it? Honestly, I expected a general desertion... ...in that decisive time. However, after some time without any sign... ...of cannibals' canoe I got relax... ...and I started to think in my trip to the continent... ... where, as Friday's father said... ...I will be welcome in his country. The white man probed me to be loyal and dependable. He told me that he, 16 Spaniards and Portuguese... ... who had sunk in an Spanish ship that they had boarded... ... Rio de la Plata towards La Habana... ...had arrived to this land, where cannibals took them... ...as prisoners. We decided to hunt a lot of animals... ...in order to get a big stock of meat... ...because we wanted to rescue other prisoners... ...and take them to the island, where they would be safe. With their help we could make a bigger and stronger boat... ...in order to arrive at the civilization. Friday was the first to start... ...he hunted little animals. We decided not to waste the powder of our weapons... ... so he had a lot of problems... ...and not so good results. They were the best option to bring other prisoners. Even I knew this trip was our only chance... ... to get out of this island, I saw very sad... ...how our two companions went away of us... ...in our great ship, which we built... ... with a lot of sacrifice and effort... I always thought that I would be free... ...in that boat, but faith decided... ...that I have to rest with Friday in our island... ... the lsland of Despair. Friday and l were alone again. We walked towards the other archipelago... ...on a strait that I called Robinson Crusoe's Strait... ...because it remembered me Moses' walk through Red Sea... ... when guiding his people... ...he listened God's voice that said: "Raise your staff and stretch out... ...your hand over the sea to divide the water... ...so that the lsraelites can go... ...through the sea on dry ground. " Actually we walked on a coral barrier... ... that nature had built in this land. After 26 years being patient, waiting for a miracle... ... this days waiting for the Spanish... ... and Friday's come back with the shipwrecked people... ... would be the harder of all. That's why I must had my mint busy. I decided to look for some land where we could seed rice. It would grow while we were building our boat... ...and would be a good stock in our travel. Master! Karu, Master! Karu! We were surrounded by those savage beasts... ...and we had to choices: to die between their jaws... ...or drowned in the swamp. We founded new visitors on the island... ...and that made us happy. All the inhabitants of the island... ... were curious about those unexpected... ...elegant and distinguished guests. Maybe a cold flow had brought the penguins... ...and their buddies just to the island. Friday was so excited, just like me... ...it was the first time that he saw a seal. Even the giants turtles came down to see... ... and welcome them. Some vassals were not delighted whit them... ...because they had to share their space. I waited my messengers return for 8 days. I was also afraid that other wrecked... ... would to take my island and possessions. But I'd preferred this rather to be surprised... ...by a horde of cannibals. Master, Master! They arrive! They are here! They are here! Master, Master! They arrive, master! They are here, Master! They are here! I ran toward the beach without guns or protection. I was petrified when saw a boat... ...that were sailing just to one mille of the island. Master. That's not canoe we wait for. We can't take risk, until to know... ...if they are friends or not. Ready to trim the sails! Prepare the anchor! Six degrees to starboard! I couldn't explain how shocked I was... ...even I was happy to see a boat... ...with civilized and friendly people... ...my joy was so great to describe it. However, my instincts advised me to be wise. Master... ...those white men, like you... ...want to eat prisoners, like savages do. No, Friday, no! Yes, Master. They want to eat them. They just want to kill them, but they won't eat them. I didn't have idea what happened. But I was afraid about those men... I was waiting to see how they killed their prisoners. I was astonished... ...I wanted to have a gun and rescue the prisoners. I remembered when I arrived to the island... ...and I realized my situation. How afraid I was about it! How many anguishes I had! And how I escaped of the fierce! In the same way that I didn't expect... ...the sea brought me the rest of the ship... ...that gave me supplies, those men will be free... ... when they thought everything was lost. Who are you? Don't move. I'm going to help you. You're really a man! Not a ghost! I'm an English man ready to help you! Follow me! Stop! Freeze! Tell me who you are. I'm the captain of that ship. The crew incited a riot against me. They don't want to kill us... ...so they decided to leave us in this island. This is my second abroad. And this man is a passenger. Do the other men bring guns? Just two of them, they started the insurrection. Do you think that if we caught them... ...could we take control of the crew? I think they will obey me. We must do it fast. Surprise will be our best ally. Stop! Stop! Or I shoot you! -Mercy, captain! Be mercy! -You, coward! Captain forgive him whit just one condition: That they regret about their treason... ...and swear to help him to arrive to Jamaica... ... where they had come. I accepted just if they were tied... ...during their stay in the island. I was very proud about how the captain admired... ...my fortification. It was, despite of all a great residence... ...even a splendid castle! And they didn't know that I also had... ...Iike the most part of kings... ...a country house. That is the signal to call the boat. When they saw that their men didn't answer... ...their call, they decided to come and look for them. Bring a boat! They were seven armed men. The three men on the stern was loyal to me. Maybe fear forced them to participate in the riot. The boatswain caused all this. The rest of the crew are a bunch of idiots... ...and cowards who didn't dare to face him! Sailors seemed surprised with that silence. They're going back to the ship! They are capable to let his comrades down! If they go, we're lost! Jonathan! Sidney! Jonathan! Sidney! Alan! If they shouted to call their comrades... ...we could surprise them with their guns discharged. It's is a good way to catch them... ...without fight. I thought it was a great idea... ...and we approached in order to surprise them... ...after the discharge. But things didn't happen like that... ... we were quiet for a long time... -... we didn't know what to do. -Alan! Erick! We must stay quiet and motionless. Hello! Hello! If they move, then the snake bite him... ...and we didn't have an antidote against his poison. If any of us move back we made noise... ...and they could discover us. When I saw them approaching us... ...I were ready to shoot to defend myself... ...and Friday's life. When I saw them went back to the beach... ...I was afraid they'd decided go back to the ship. I was talking with the captain and suddenly... ...I had a great idea to stop that wretched. Here! Hello! Here! Hello! Here! Here! Here! Here! Surrender, captain! You're lost! Surrender, captain! It's the best for you! Surrender, captain! It's the best for you! Now I'm the boss! When I heard those words I wanted to attack him... ...because I couldn't stand that one man came... ...to give me orders, I was the governor... ...the master and commander of my island. Surrender, captain! You're surrounded! Surrender! Freeze! You're surrounded! Surrender! I promise you to respect your lives! Surrender! Everyone will have shelter... ...and I won't execute you, if the Governor wanted it! I must confess in that moment the captain... ...seemed to me a very sympathetic man... ...when I heard him to accept me as a governor... ...and master of the island. So I thought it was my duty to bring peace to my land. Don't dare you to move! I command you to surrender. You're surrounded by my men. As the English governor of the island... ...I forgive their lives, they promised loyalty... ...to the captain and promised me to help him... ... to take the control of the boat... ...I thought it was our chance to leave the island. I considered that Friday and I must rest... ... while the captain and his men... ...take the ship again and waiting for them. Hello, there! Give us a rope! What happened? Why did you take so long? I'll tell you later. -Freeze! -Freeze! Freeze! Don't move! Freeze! Go to prow! Two... Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven canon shoots was the signal of their succeed. I had the hunch my freedom was near and Friday... ... was with me to share it. He loved me like a father and I love him like a son. I, Robinson Crusoe, as governor... ...and master of this island their rivers and seas... ...promise you... ...that all your rights will be respected... ...if you promise to care, serve and protect... ...all the governor's properties in his absent. That's all. Dear Governor, friend and savior... ...your properties are on the ship.... ...which belongs to you, because I owe you my life... ...and is ready to weigh anchor. I almost fainted to realize that my freedom was so near. So I had to say goodbye to my island. Are you happy to be rescued... ...and go with me to my country... ...where you'll find civilized people and freedom? Yes, I'm happy because I go with my Master... ...but I'm sad because when my father come back... ...I won't be there. I also was very sad, because I realize... ...that I won't find my freedom leaving the island... ...but I lost it. It was December 19, 1686. But I promised Friday that we would back someday... ...because I'd never forgot all the things that I passed... ...all the adventures and misadventures that I lived... ...through 27 years living in that island. The lsland of Despair.
