Vinnie, you promised. Just trying to make it through the day, baby. Where did you get that? Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it? That's all I do is worry about it. I mean, do you think they're just going to keep fronting you without payment? It's cool. My credit's good. Oh, oh, and that's supposed to make me feel better, huh? I mean this shit will kill you! You crazy? That's $200 worth you just threw on the floor. Why should I worry about it, huh? Your credit's good. Yeah, go on. Get up there. Stay outa my face! How you doing? I missed you yesterday. Yeah. I'm real sorry about that but I was just getting ready to come by and see you. I guess I saved you a trip. According to my calculations, we seem to be missing a kilo of cocaine. Now, how do you suppose that bag got away? Huh? Any ideas? I don't know, But. I swear to God. Perhaps I can refresh your memory. Wait. Wait. Don't. I took it. I'm sorry, man. I swear on my father. I was just going to come by and pay you for it. So where's my money? Well, that's what I was going to come and talk to you about. Oh, Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie. No, no, no. I can get it. I just got to make some collections, you know? It's like singing the same old song on the charts. Going all the way up to number one with a bullet. No, Blade. please. Go ahead. Take it. It's worth way more than I owe you. A lucky horseshoe, Ray. Please. Vinnie, I'm touched. Chico, am I a pawnbroker? No. Do I look like a pawnbroker? No. Do I look like a pawnbroker? I am not a pawnbroker. And you know what? It's only lucky, if you were on the right side. You had it upside down and that's bad luck. Get her. Now, you see, Vinnie? That's the way you're supposed to wear it. That's good luck. See it? Ah, perfect fit. I'm not interested. Yeah. I know what I said. But I changed my mind. Look, I don't want it. All right? And do me a favor, huh? Why don't you just stop calling me, all Right Hey, Mario, you having ex-girlfriend problems? No, no. Long distance carrier. Shit. Got some new talent, hey, Mario? Business must be good. Look I told your boy. I can't be paying you protection money no more. You get my message? Yeah. I got the message. That's what I'm doing here. Show you what might happen in case you don't make my payments. Boys. Hey, what are you doing? Get outa here. Guys go. Cut it out. Tell them to cut it out. Maybe this will show you the value of a good protection agency. Hey, cut it out. Ho. What say you come down here, cowgirl? Ride my fucking bronco? Oh. Hey, Mario, what's happening? Wow. Nobody move. What took you so long? You know me, I have to have my coffee. Officer Palermo, I got one thing to say, thank you very much. Oh, no, don't mention it. You think later on you and I could catch a cup of coffee, huh? You know, I still have a few bullets left. Coffee? Coffee? I wasn't needed. I wasn't needed. I wasn't needed here. Woo, hoo! Well, if it isn't the queen of the rodeo. Oh, back off, Fredericks. Well, how would you like to come back to my office and let me shoot you with my love gun, honey. Thanks, but you know what? I heard that you might be low on ammo. That's pretty funny. All right. OK, look. The captain wants to see you. Great. Do you mind covering while I go change? Sure. But you might want to keep that outfit on, especially if he brings up that raise you've been asking for. That's not even funny. It's not funny. It's just a thought. Listen, you're gonna go and you're gonna wear this. What the hell's going on? Sir. Palermo, what is with that get up? It's the undercover bust at Wiggles, sir. Oh, yeah, congratulations. Thanks. Need to see you in my office. Yes, sir. May I please go change first? Yeah, go ahead. Oh, and Palermo. Yes, sir? Y'all hurry back to my office now, pardner. Hey, Stace. Got the word you had a tough day. You kidding me? I danced for less than 30 minutes. Made over $100. You're joking. What's the name of this dive? Maybe I should do a little moonlighting. Now you would make a fortune. Unfortunately, it's all in very sweaty ones. Ick. Got the picture. You splitting that with Zig? No way. It was my butt on the line. He didn't even show up until after everything went down. Zig knew you could handle it, that's all. Besides, I heard he told Dietrich that he was going to stand by outside to cover you. Really? He didn't want to embarrass you, that's all. How long you guys been partners? A little over two years. And in all that time he never... No, no, no, no. Not that he didn't try anything, but no. So what's the problem? He's kind of cute, earns a decent pay, and he's straight. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty. If it doesn't work out, you just get the captain to reassign him to Vice and I'll take good care of him. Jody. You are something else. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I had nothing to do with that. Yeah, right. Come on, I'm your partner. All right. All right. I'll make it up to you. Dinner on me tonight at Zord's. You're on. I am? Yeah, you are. Hey, Stace. You really do have a nice pair of legs. What's that? About the size of yours. Real nice. That'll be all. Right, Captain. Detective Palermo, this is Lisa Wilkes. Stacey, call me Stacey. Ms. Wilkes arrived home from work this afternoon to find out her boyfriend had been murdered. Oh, I'm sorry. She walked all the way here because her phone has been disconnected. Look, I think homicide;s about done. I was hoping maybe you could take her home. Sure, sure. That's not a problem. Do you want to go? OK, yeah. OK, I'll be out in a minute then. Thanks. Why do you want me to do the babysitting? I've got a ton of paperwork to do. Cause I think you can get her to open up. She knows more than she's letting on, and I hate to admit it, you're probably the best damn detective this precinct has. I do believe that was a compliment, Captain. Yeah. Yeah. You know, if it wasn't for that god awful tie, you wouldn't be half bad. I love this tie. Lisa, let's get going. Stace, what's up? Ziggy. Oh, god, could you book those boys for me? I have to run an errand. Sure. What about dinner? Oh, god. I'll call you. Sorry. They're here. No sweat. Norris and Bach are on their way. Don't you have a sheet or something you can cover him up with? They took his ring. The bastard shot him and they took his ring anyway. It's only thing that ever meant anything to him. Oh, my god. - Oh, no. - What? What is it? It's a death notice for me. No, it's not for you. Look, they do that to scare people. I got to get out of here. I can't stay here. OK. Do you have anybody you can stay with? No. I don't know. Can't we just get out of here? Lisa. That's them. Take them out. You all right? You want to go somewhere, stop somewhere? No. Look, it's OK. Nobody's going to hurt you. Get real. Give you my word on that. That's supposed to make me feel better. I know what you're going through. You don't know shit. You're just a damn cop. There is a huge difference between your world and mine. You only write the reports. I live them. But you wouldn't know anything about that. Yeah, I guess you're right. See that? I wouldn't know anything about that. That was because I didn't have dinner ready on time. I've been there, Lisa. I'm sorry. Isn't there anywhere I can take you? No, not really. A relative? My folks live in Pennsylvania and I haven't spoken to them in years. So you don't have any friends? No. My friends won't even talk to me. Vinny was real trouble. It wasn't his fault. It was just his habit and all. It must've been tough. I stood by his side and you gotta give me credit for that. I loved him. God. God dammit! And those bastards just killed him like he was some animal. It's all right. Just let it out. Oh, god. Lisa, get down. Get down! Stay down! Stacy! You all right? No, I'm not all right. They just tried to kill me and you know they'll try again. Come on. Where are we going? Someplace where you'll be safe. Come on, let's go! This better to be good. Captain? Nichols, I told you never to use his phone unless it's an emergency. Sorry, Captain, I tried normal channels, but I couldn't get through. I thought you'd like to know what happened. Oh, let me guess. You're putting in for early retirement. No, but Palermo might be. Why so? Two punks took a dry dive off the Fifth Street Bridge. Seems they were chased through downtown by Palermo, shots were fired. Let me speak to her. No can do. According to witnesses, she took off in that clunker of hers right after the accident. Classic. Nothing, she calls that old heap of junk a classic. Belonged to her old man before he left the force. Listen, where the hell is she at? Probably in hiding. Word on the street is there's a big payday waiting for anybody who can put the finger on Vinnie Mateo's girlfriend. All right, Nichols, stay on it, will you? - You bet. - Thanks. Food here is pretty bad. But you'll feel a lot safer, believe me. Yes, Rita. Well, I hate to bring everyone down, but I talked to my psychic pal last night and... Oh, brother, here we go. Quiet, Tony. Hey, hey, hey, that's enough. Just let her talk. Go ahead, Rita. Anyway, she said something bad was going to happen in the next couple of days. Yeah, you're going to get your phone bill. I can't believe you actually fall for that shit. You're so gullible. Don't even go there. At least I'm not sitting around waiting for collect calls from my jailed boyfriend. Are you due for a tranquilizer? Oh, cat fight, cat fight. Uh, oh. Anybody home? Stacey. Hey, sis. So good to see you. It's about time you came out for a visit. Hey everybody this is my sister, Stacey. Or should I say Detective Palermo. Stacey, the gang. Hi, everybody. Could I please talk to you for a second? Oh, yes, sure OK. Smoke them if you got them. I'll be a few minutes. Come on this way. You know you missed our fundraiser the other day. Oh god, I know. I'm sorry. Put me down for a C note. I'm good for it. You bet I will. So, what can I do for you. Cindy this is Lisa. Hi. Lisa needs a safe place to stay for a while. Well, we're just getting the place in order, but I'm sure we can make some room. - Thanks. - Sure. Can I use your phone? Yeah, go ahead. I'll just go wrap up the meeting and then we'll get Lisa settled. And you are staying for dinner. I won't take no for an answer. Make yourself at home. Thanks. She's really nice. That's my sister. Uh, Were you baptized Bambi? Is that the name on your birth certificate? No, I was named after the movie. I see. Ziggy, it's me. Palermo, where the hell are you? I'm over at my sister's shelter. We got caught in a drive by. - Are you OK? - Yeah, we're fine. Lisa just needs a safe place to stay for a while. Yeah, the captain filled me in. You think she knows anything? I'd say so. All right. Listen, I got it. What about dinner? I'll have to take a rain check. No problem. Something's come up here anyway. Anything important? - Nothing I can't handle. - OK. Then I'll call you before I leave here. I'll see you. Miss Bambi, would you like to join me in a culinary delight? Lieutenant, I'm not that kind of girl. I meant dinner. Oh super. Yeah. OK. Put the word out on the street. I want this bitch found and I want her dead. And I don't care what it takes. If she fingers us, they're going to lock our asses up in jail and throw away the key. Get your fucking feet off my desk. Hold on. Yeah. Boss. They got Paco and Torrez. Shit. But I followed them to an old house on Route Seven. It's easy to get into. We'll take them down. - Just get the hell out here. - All right. Good work, Chico. Be right over. Saddle up, boys. Pay back time. Look, I can't help you if you don't help me. If you saw somebody or someone, you've got to tell me. Hey, why don't you two come out meet the girls. All right, let's go get you settled in. We all pitch in and work as a team around here. Makes everybody feel needed and important. This is Sammy Jo. She comes to us all the way from Quebec. Hi, Sammy Jo. What's with her? Don't take offense. She's been through a lot. About two months ago, they found her in an alley completely naked, gagged, beaten left for dead. She hasn't spoken a word since. Jesus, that's so sad. Yeah. And of course, they never found the guy who did it. Oh, and here's Charisse with some of her famous biscuits. Hey, looks like I'm going to have to fix two more plates. You look like you could use a good meal, huh girl? I am kind of hungry. Well, sit on down girl. Eat as much as you want. We're going to put some meat on that little ass of yours. Charisse. Are you the cook? No, I'm not the cook. I'm just the same as anyone else here, homeless. OK? How did you wind up here? Let's see, a broken collarbone, fractured skull, dislocated shoulder. God, he did that to you? To me? No, honey, it's what I did to him. See, I got tired of him putting his hands on me. So I wanted till we went to bed one night and beat his mother fucking ass with a frying pan. Hey, you got to look out for number one. Rita, come on in. Rita, this is Lisa and my sister, Stacey. Hi. Thanks, honey. She can be very emotionally unstable at times. She spent the last three years in prison for murdering her abusive husband. But we're trying to find some way to ease her back into some kind of normal existence. Oh, and here's Helen. Hello. Hi. Watch what you say. The place is bugged. She's a paranoid schizophrenic. What? She thinks that government agents are out to kill her. Oh, and last but not least, Toni. Toni, this is Lisa and my sister, Stacey. We've met. I was going to say you look familiar, but I can't remember. You busted my boyfriend. Johnny Cotello. And thanks to you, I'm stuck living in this shithole. Toni. Well, it ain't the Waldorf. Look, one day you're going to thank me for doing you a really big favor. A favor? My boyfriend is in jail because of you. Well, jail is exactly where he belongs. Stacey. You know, I swear to God if I could put a bullet through your fucking skull I would. Hey, that's enough, both of you. I don't care if she's your sister or not, OK.? Don't expect me to lay out the welcome mat. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry. It's OK. What kind of place did you get me into? Would you rather go back to your apartment? Listen, you guys make yourselves at home. I'm going to go get Dan and Mike. Dan and Mike? The maintenance guys. This place would fall apart without them. Hey, guys. Dinner's on the table. All right. Coming in. Well, hurry. It'll get cold. Come on, Dan. Charisse made biscuits. Dan? Dan! Oh my god. He's shot! Mike! Dan! Get him inside. Get him inside. Get him inside! Get down! Stay on the floor! Stacey. Stay down. Where's she going? Shoot the motherfuckers. Shoot, girl. What the hell is going on here? This is worse than my old neighborhood. Just stay down. Did you call for help? The phone's dead. Great. What are we supposed to do now? Well, they stopped. Maybe they're gone. Cindy, I don't think there's a chance that they're gone. Everybody just stay calm. Oh, shit, guys. They're back. Stay where you are. That's him! Everybody OK? Sammy Jo? Sammy Jo? Sammy Jo, it's me. It's Cindy. It's OK. It's OK. Sammy Jo! It's OK! That's a good girl. Is she all right? I hope so. Say one for me too, honey. So, supercop, what do these guys want? How the hell should I know? None of this shit started till you got here. You think it's my fault? Well, it ain't mine. It's the government. It's them. They found me. Helen, we've been through this before. The government is not after you. How do you know that? Who are they then? What do they want? Maybe they want the money. I have over $5,000 in cash upstairs from the fundraiser. I never made it to the bank. No, if it was money, they would have asked for it. It's my fault. What they want with you, girl? What difference does it make? She put us all in danger. Helen. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you got that they all want? They want me. That's ridiculous. My boyfriend. They killed him and I saw the whole thing. Oh, great. She has to leave. You've got to go. They'll kill her. They're going to kill us. No one is going anywhere. She's going to get us all killed. Look, maybe somebody heard the gunshots and called it in. I don't know, Stacey. The nearest place is two miles down the road. It's not that far. They could have still heard the shots. Yeah, did she mention it's a firing range? Great. Well, the nearest police station... Is 10 miles away. Shit. Cindy, maybe you were right. I don't see anybody. OK. Let's not do anything rash. Let's just sit tight and wait. Wait for what? For them to come back here and blow us all away? I agree with her. She's putting us all in jeopardy. We don't even know this girl. ...please take a chill pill. You know what I think? I think you should take your little friend over there and you both should get the hell out of here. We're not running a witness protection program. And do you know what I say? No one is going anywhere. This girl came to us for shelter and she's going to get it, just like I gave it to you. You got that? I didn't bring the Wild Bunch with me. Look, she's right. I'm going to go. I'm putting you all in danger. See, even she agrees. Lisa, I promise you I'd protect you. I'm not going to go back on my word. That's right, honey. You're under our roof now and we take care of each other here. See, that's right we're all a team. Las mujeres. - Isn't that right, Cindy? - Yes, Rita. That's right. We are a team. How you doing on ammo? Six shots. That is not a lot. OK, listen up. I've got an idea. I've got two shotguns in the back of my car in the trunk. If you can distract them somehow, I can run out there get the shotguns, radio in for help. All right, that's good. Give me the keys. I'll go get them. Forget it. I can't ask you to do that. You're not asking me. OK, I'm telling you. I'm not risking any civilians. Palermo. Palermo! She's still on the road, boss. But I'm sure she heard you. Don't be a wise ass. Sagowski just spoke to a vagrant who said Lisa Wilkes was already home when her boyfriend got hit. You think she saw anything? That's what I'm trying to find out. See if you can track her down, will you? Oh yeah sure, boss. Good. Stace, don't you think if someone would have called the police, they would have been here by now? Definitely. I don't know what's going on. You say you've got a radio in that car, right? Forget it. No, I'm not going to forget it. Look, don't even think about it. It's my responsibility. I'm trained for dangerous situations. Besides, you're working here as a... As a what? As a maintenance man, is that what you were going to say? Look let me explain something to you. All right guys, this is not helping any. And Mike, as much as I hate the idea, she is right. No, Cindy, she's not right. It's suicide and you know it. What do you suggest? We have to create a diversion. We've got to try to drama away from the car. You got any ideas? Well, I got some bottles downstairs and I got some turpentine. Let's make some Molotov cocktails. I've got rags in the kitchen. Let's go. All right, guys, I'll be right back. Stacey. I don't know how you do this. God, I just really wish I had your strength. Where do you think I got it from? Love you. What do you mean the lines are down? Will you just try it again? All right, all right. Thank you. Freddy. Yeah. Keep trying to get Stacey on the radio. I'm going to try to find her now. You got it. We could use a couple more. Great. Just throw them when you hear me yell. Oh, yes, ma'am. This isn't the time for sarcasm. All I'm saying is I should be the one going. OK? I'm not discussing it. Hey. Be careful. I will. Still no sign of them. All right. Just yell as loud as you can to see if you see any kind of movement. All right. Stacey, please don't do this for me. I'm doing this for all of us. Hey, good luck, Sis. Vaya con Dios. Now! Go! Dispatch. Dispatch. Shit! Where'd you get that? Sometimes it just pays to break the rules. They're never going to make it. I don't know why you said... She's going to make it. What are you looking at? Nothing. Thanks. Jesus. God, Helen. She OK? Helen? She's dead. Cindy, I'm so sorry. Lisa. Where's Lisa? Lisa! In here! Everybody stay down. - Somebody get some bandages. - Yeah, I'm on it. I'll cover the door. Did you get through? I got the guns and ammo, no radio. - Let's get you out of here. - Let's go. Make some room. Wait a minute. No. How can anybody live out here? Got coyotes up your ass, everything. Where the hell are you, Stace? Come on. How's that feeling? Oh, it's, it's fine. Don't think I'll be playing softball for a while. What position do you play? What position do I play? After all it's happened, you still manage to muster up some small talk, huh? Helps pass the time, I guess. Shortstop. First base, that's what I play, female officers league. Really? Yeah. I like first base. It's an important position. Should come by the ball park some time. I'd like that but, you know I'm just a uh maintenance man. Hey, I'm sorry about that. I apologize. Thank God. Someone's coming. It's a cop. Well, never thought I'd be glad to see one of those guys. It's my partner. Ziggy, look out! You bastards! Fuck you! Sorry, Stacey. No! Sorry. This is war, gentlemen. They killed Juan. I want them dead. Screw the cops. Chico, you call in for extra troops. They mess with us, we'll give them a goddamn bloodbath. Looks like they're getting ready for another attack. How many do you think? It's hard to tell. I'd say a few dozen though. Gotta do something. I say we barricade ourselves in. Look, we don't have much of a choice. OK. Let's do it. All right, guys, listen up. We're going to do our best to barricade ourselves in. Downstairs I've got lumber and tools. Let's go down there and start bringing it up. Also grab anything that can be used as a weapon. They may be making a charge. OK. Now one last thing. I can handle that pistol if you're going to use a shotgun. OK. Here. Any units in the vicinity of Park and Lincoln, reports of gun fire. Please respond. Unit nine to base. We're on our way. Ten-four unit nine. Come on, Sammy. Here, take that. Move. OK. Come on, Sammy Jo, this way. Got some more for you. That should hold. Any more downstairs? Yeah, do you want me to go get it? Yeah, hurry. Thanks. Don't shoot. Scared the shit out of me. Just thought I'd come down and help. It's OK. I got it. So why did you do it? Do what? Risk your life to save mine. It was no big deal. No big deal. You could have gotten yourself killed. But I didn't. You didn't, so let's just leave it at that. OK. Look, I'm really sorry about Johnny. Never meant to hurt you. I was only doing my job. I wish there some way we could bury the hatchet. OK. Well, I guess I can't blame you for hating me then. I don't hate you. I knew what was going on all along and I let it happen. You know, I kept asking myself over and over again, what's your limit? I mean when is it really enough, you know? But the truth of the matter is, I didn't have the strength to walk away. Toni, don't blame yourself. I blamed everyone else for the past year. I think it's time I face the facts. You made a mistake. You're only human. We've all got our war stories to tell. Now, it's just time to let it go, start over again. It's easier said than done. I did it. So can you. If you only let your guard down for a split second, you realize there are people around who care about you. I'm one of them. I'd love to help, if you'd only let me. This is getting heavy. So what do you say? OK. What do you want us to do with the rest of this wood? Arm yourselves. Just in case. They some near me, I'll slice their conjones. I don't have any 357 ammo. Already got it covered. I had some stashed in the back. Toni, hey. Bet you're glad I got it now, aren't you? All right, guys, listen up. Here's what we're going to do. Hey, who put you in charge? You think just because you're the hombre, that makes you the boss? Rita, we are a team here. Let's hear what he has to say. If you say so, OK, Cindy. Yes, Rita, I say so. Go ahead, Mike. Thanks. Everybody's got a weapon, right? Good. Because I think you're going to need it. Guys, from what I can tell, it looks to me like they're planning a charge. So I say we break into pairs, each of us take a room. If they start to break through, do your best to hold them off. If you have trouble, yell it out. Any objections? No. All right. Let's do it. Sounds like you know what you're doing. Had a little experience. What kind of experience? Marines. Why didn't you tell me that before? I sort of tried to, but you wouldn't let me. Sorry. So what brought you here from the Marines? My little sister used to be here. She used to live here while I was overseas. But she got into a lot of trouble and sort of fell in with the wrong crowd, if you know what I mean. Your sister Cindy was the only one that would help her out. She's terrific, your sister. Yeah, I know. Well, when I got back from overseas, I came back here looking for her. We were going to move up to Oregon. Figured it would be good for her and figured it would be good for me. She's the only family I have left. When I got back here Cindy told me that she had run off. I went looking for her but I didn't have much luck. I came back here. I stayed, hoping that she would come back too. She knew you were here, she'd be back. Listen, everybody's set. It's been quiet. Do you think they left? I don't think so. I think they're just waiting us out. Oh, shit. I can't believe no one has called the police. Unit nine to base. Go ahead, Unit nine. No sign of any activity. Everything's pretty quiet. 10-4. Give it the once around one more time. 10-4. One more time. Hey, I just want to say that I'm sorry about all this. I feel like this is all my fault. It's not your fault. But it is my fault. I mean, if I had just been honest with the police from the start none of this would have never happened. I was just so scared. Lisa, everybody gets scared. Yeah well I've caused so much trouble and I feel so responsible. I know but you are not to blame. Look, you just have to accept that what's done is done and move on. I know it isn't easy but we're here for you, and when all this is over. You mean if we make it out of here alive. No. I mean when all this is over. I hope you decide to stay on with us. You really mean that? Yeah, Lisa, I really mean it. I see great things in you. That's the first time anyone has ever said that to me. Captain. You find them? Line is dead. Disconnected? No, the phone company says they're having a problem in the area. Send over a squad car. Sure thing, Captain. Got one right near there, checking on a report of... Now! Right, Captain. Just pray, Sammy Jo. God will see us through this. Pray for me too. Quiet as a graveyard. Yeah, pretty dead. Let's get something to eat. Gurdy, you're always eating. Take a left at the next corner, the best coffee shop in town is about a mile down. Hey, wait a minute. Looks like we got some activity. I don't like the looks of this. Call the Sarge. Get him to contact the phone company. Penny. Come here and check this out. Base to Unit nine. Come in. Come in, Unit nine. Man, are you as hungry as I am? Was kind of looking forward to those biscuits. Yeah, well if these guys don't kill us, those biscuits will. Come in, Unit nine. Damn. Unit 12? Come in, Unit 12. This wait is going to drive me nuts. Girl, you already nuts. You should talk. You're the craziest bitch I know. Honey, I spent my whole life going in and out of bad situations. If I didn't laugh it off, I think I'd just shrivel up and die. I hear you. Yeah, my mama always told me, things are looking bad, just be thankful they ain't worse. Yeah, well. they can't get much worse than this. You got that right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Got something funny going on. I am not in a laughing mood. Did you find them? That's just it. I've already sent tow cars to the area and I can't get either one on the radio. Damn it. If that is pulling another practical joke, I swear I... I don't think so. I've checked with the phone company. They can't find their repair team either. - What are you telling me? - I don't know. It's like the whole neighborhood just turned into the Bermuda Triangle or something. Fredericks, do I have to go down there myself? I'll send another unit. And send them straight to the shelter. And make sure they stay in constant radio contact. Right. I just wanted you to know. Bermuda freaking triangle. What are you thinking? I think your hunch was right. They're just waiting us out. Look. Cindy, it's the police! Oh, my god. Thank God you're here. No, get down! Oh, my god, no! Everybody, back to their posts. Hey, Chico, we got company. Oh, shit, stay back. Stay back. Cover the windows. Here, take this. Go! Get down! We did it! We kicked their ass. Thank god. They just gave up. Yeah, right. They're not going to stop till they get what they want. We're not going to die in here. Rita, back off. No. She's the one that they want. Why don't you just let them have her? We're not all going to suffer. You never cease to amaze me. Don't pay her no mind. She's just tripping as usual. Guys, come on. We're not out of this yet. We're got to get these windows boarded back up. Forget the windows. We got to make some kind of move. How much longer do you think we can all hold them off? As long as it takes. There's no way we're getting out of here without being detected. Why don't we just blow the place up then? Girl, have you lost your mind? You got a better idea? Wait a minute. Toni, what are you thinking? OK, look, if we can lure them in somehow, we could trap them inside and blow the place up with gas. How? Turn on all the gas jets in the kitchen, throw a can in the microwave. And how do we get out? Once they're inside, we go downstairs, and get out the doors to the basement. Stace, what do you think? Well... I got to tell you, this is not the best idea I've ever heard. Well, unless someone's got a better one, I really don't see we have much of a choice. Anybody? All right, that settles it. Let's just do it. Captain. What is it now, Fredericks? Alien abduction? Worse. I got a couple reports from the 47th precinct about gangbangers cruising around, gunfire in the area. Still no word from any of our units. Sagowski or Palermo. Shit. Wait a minute. This graffiti. It's gang death notice. They found out where Lisa Wilkes is. Alert the SWAT team. Get every available unit down there now. Call the neighboring precincts. We need backup. Go! Lisa, get the tape. Come on, Trace, you're making a meal out of it. One more and we'll call it a day. Got it. All right, listen up. Guys come back here licking your wounds like you went up against some major people. They're just a bunch of bitches, man. Here, take this. You think this is going to work? It better. - Body's in the roof. - The house is all set. We need to get into the basement. Let's go. Let me finish up. I'll be right there. All right. Girls, move. All right, you listen to me. You make this quick. This place is ready to go. Go, go go. Move, Move, move. Come on! Come on! Where's Stacey? I don't know! Now what we're going to do is we're going to storm this place. And we're going to do it before the god damn cops get here with their army. Where's Stacey? She's coming. Move. All right. Everybody all right? - Yeah. - All right. Sit tight. And you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Because I know I am. So do it right this time. Shit. They've got Chico. I want everybody in that house dead. When Stacey gets here, we'll blow this hole and get out of here. Shit. Where's she going? I gotta get something. No, forget it. It's too late. I can't wait. Cindy. Cindy. Cindy! There's Stacey. What is she waiting for? Come on! Let's go. Shit! It's locked. Locked? What do you mean locked? I never locked it from the outside. Come on! Come on, follow me. Come on, come on, let's go. Rita, come on, you first. Good girl. Come on, come on, come on! Come on, you're next. You get your tired ass up there before.. Come on! How you doing? That's enough. Come on, let's go. Move, Move. Sammy Jo, please. We gotta go. Come on. Leave them alone! Where are they? I'm not telling you shit. Ah. Come on, come on. Where's Stacey? There's no time. Get down, everybody. Get down now. This could be next. Oh, god, there's not enough time. Get the door. Mike? Stacey? Stacey? Mike? Mike? Stacey? Stacey? Mike? Stacey! Come on! Come on! Move! Come on. Cindy! Get out the door. Out the door. Stacey. Stacey, what... Drop all your weapons, or I'm going to blow her fucking brains out. And I'm going to do it in such a way that I won't even get a speck of blood on my clothes. What was that? Jesus. my God. Oh. You OK? Yeah. Palermo, what the hell is going on? We've got everything under control, sir. All right? Yeah, thanks. Good. Let's clean this mess up. Sweet Jesus. What are we going to do now? Well, I suggest we start looking for a new place. You know what? Might be a little crowded, but until you guys find a place, why don't you guys just stay with me? OK. Even me? Especially you, Toni. That's right. It's time to start over. Hey. What? What on earth was so important for you to go all the way back upstairs like you did? Fundraiser money. I worked too hard for this. And hey, it certainly came in handy, don't you think? Maybe. Oh, just leave me out of it, girls. How you doing? I'm good. how you doing? Everybody is coming over to stay at my place for a while until they get resettled. I was thinking I could make some room for you, if you'd like. Aren't you afraid I might get on base. Come here.
