A SHOCHIKU FILM HOKKAIDO Dear, the horse died next door. It did? Everyone's gathered and crying. Go show your face. So it died. Poor thing. The weather's been great. It's too hot. We were worried about frost damage. We have a nice crop. We've got the sun to thank. Hello. Back to see your parents? I've got some free time. You've grown into a nice housewife. Don't tease me. I mean it. I'll drop by later. Say hi to everyone. Okay we'll be waiting. Mr. Stonemason, I'll help you. Hey could you lend a hand? Come on, a little bit more. Our story took place amidst this peaceful scenery. It's the record of a nightmare. Not a single person talks about what happened. Perhaps one day it will be told as a legend of a mountain demon. Until then, people will remain silent and not speak of it. Because these mountains still glow red under sunset clouds. Then people's ears pick up violent alarm bells. They hear yells, curses, and even gunshots. Their souls feel guilt over the nightmares of bygone days. A LEGEND OR WAS IT?

Mother was worried about your return. We're evacuees hosted by the village. And you're being sent back with illness. And the welcome party? They're busy Nobody wants to come. But it's Mr. Takamori's order. I hate that village mayor. So you don't mind marrying Mr. Takamori's son? I don't want to. I don't care anymore. Who knows what's going to happen to Japan. I don't think I'll ever go back to Tokyo. We're evacuees. We don't have enough to eat. If I marry him, it'll help everyone. Don't marry him for that. You just don't understand. Mr. Takamori brings us many things these days, so we're doing fine. No families shared anything with us before. We had nothing to eat or drink. Mother was crying all the time. These villagers are so mean. Norio. Don't worry Say it. L, too, hate these mean villagers. I'm back now. I'll work hard. Don't push yourself. Big Brother. Here comes Kagari. I'm coming home victorious Bravely I swore and left home If not triumphant, I can't die Each time I hear the marching trumpet Aren't you happy? Yes, it's been four years. What's he like? Does he look just like his photo? I hope so. But he's had an illness. He must be beautiful, like you and your daughters. Oh, my Thank you. He's here! He's here! They're back with him! He's here! They're back with him! He's here! You must welcome him as host. Go tell them to hurry We've been waiting. My dumb son is so excited. A lovesick man is a weak man. Ridiculous. - Parasol! - Yes, sir. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! That's him. Mr. Takamori's son. - Welcome back. - Thank you very much. Thanks for helping my family Don't mention it. Care to ride the horse? You're too kind. Don't hesitate. Right, Miss Kieko? No, it's quite alright. You're a hero. You're embarrassing me. Please get back on the horse. If you say so. I've got a crippled hand. You... I was in your Company during the attack on Zhengzhou. FIGHT JAPAN TO THE END Idiot! Don't just stand there and stare! The Sonobe family lived in «Salmon Cottage». A riverside cabin abandoned after a flood. They were evacuated from war-tom Tokyo. They were originally from Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan. The father, an engineering specialist, was sent somewhere in Malaya. They had not heard from him. Their second son Masahiko, an airman, went to war in the south. They hadn't heard from him, either. Their oldest son Hideyuki's return encouraged them to be happy. But, a dark shadow hung ominously over this family even then. Yuri's shooting the shotgun. «She who shoots oft shall hit something». Come on. We might have a feast tonight. It's good we get more food rations, but it's so heavy Must be hard work for you. A spoiled boy from Tokyo, working in the mountains. Funny isn't it? Yuri's mom used to give my brothers and sisters piggyback rides. I wish she were alive. She could've helped your family a lot. You guys are helping us a lot. Without you, my family would've all died. It's wartime. We've gotta help each other. Dad! It's a problem. The deputy mayor pressured Shintaro about it at the Ration Supply Centre. Just say «No». We're afraid of the aftermath. If the Takamori family turns against us, I worry what will happen. Either way I doubt they can chase us out. We're trying farming, but nothing much grows here. But let's not sacrifice Kieko. Your story did shake me to the bones. I wouldn't want her to marry him, either. But how do we turn down their marriage proposal? Tell them her fiancé is at war. Hideyuki. Once Kieko and a man had promised their future to one another. Soon after the family had been evacuated into the mountains, he was blown apart in the clouds above French Indochina. Yuri, how old are you, again? You're funny Dad. I'm 19. You're 19, huh? How old are you, Dad? I'm 53. You're so old. I'm not that old. Now you've got me worried. Hang in there. I've gotta hang in there. You're still only 19. I'm old enough. Not yet. When your mom was 19, she was working for the Sonobes. She used to give Hideyuki piggyback rides. What a hard worker she was. Hideyuki gave me a piggyback ride today - He did? - Yup. Now we're even. Even, huh? It was fun. It was fun, huh? - Good evening. - Wow. What a surprise. Come on in. I have a favour to ask. - Please. - What is it? It's about Kieko. And Mr. Takamori's son. Please turn it down. They might be offended, but... We haven't seen the end of it. Hideyuki. Our field has been destroyed. Who did this? We worked so hard to cultivate this wasteland. Damn it. Shintaro. Mr. Shintaro. Mrs. Sonobe, the police are here. Arrest the perpetrator. Who in the world has done this? Obvious, isn't it? Look at the horse tracks. It's clear who did it. Yeah, well, we've only got horse tracks. Isn't that evidence? Of course not. There are many horses in the village. There's only one man who would do this. Go to the Takamori family and ask them if he walked his horse last night. Don't be stupid. How can I accuse the mayor's son? And without evidence? It's your job to investigate, isn't it? It's my job, but... Shintaro. Forget about it. We evacuees will have no place to go if the villagers hate us. We'll just have to bear it. After that, many other families' fields were vandalized in the village. And then a rumour started. They said all the attacks were revenge by the first victim, the Sonobe family. The villagers knew it pleased Mayor Takamori's family to spread this rumour. This gave the villagers an excuse to ravage their neighbours’ fields. Soon their innocent souls were corrupted. Their boundless greed started to grow. TAKAMORI FAMILY PROPERTY KEEP OUT Another dirty trick. In these mountains? What's with them? They bothered to put up the sign. Let's stay away Bastards. Hey Shintaro. What? He's acting funny What? What do you want? - Ouch. You're hurting me. - Who said that? - I'm worried about you... - Who said it? What are you doing? Stop. What's going on, Shintaro? Stop it. What is it? «They may be right»? How dare you! Someone said they saw - - Stop it! - Damn You! Just wait and see, you thief! Shut up, you brat. Shintaro, don't. - Bastards. - That's enough. What did they say? No, nothing. Don't worry about them. The kid said, «You thief». It's nothing new that their crops get stolen in the village. What are they complaining now? Are they saying we've stolen something? No way That's foolish. No way But, this morning, you know? The coal store owner's field across the river was trashed. Someone claims to have seen Miss Kagari and Norio coming up river. That's nothing. They went to fish for trout in the river. They caught one. Come by and you'll see. But, Hideyuki, listen. I've gotta tell you something now. This rumour wasn't started today or yesterday My girl Yuri hears it each time she goes to the village. Once someone made such a dig at her, she got in a big fight. Goichi Takamori must be spreading the rumour, out of spite. On behalf of God Smite the unjust Nothing compares to Our brave and loyal soldiers Cheers of jubilation Send them off Now they're leaving Their father's and mother's land They'll be victorious Or they won't come home alive Come here! - Please don't. - Out of my way! Shut up! Out of the way! Bastard. Let me go. Go ahead. Laugh at me again. No way I didn't laugh. You did. You saw me and laughed. That's ridiculous. Who'd laugh at you, young master? - He's right. - Shut up! Please forgive me. I apologize. No. Sing that song again. «Gets rejected» and then what? It's just a song. You bastard. You said, «Gets rejected, gets crippled». Young master. - Bastard! - Don't be violent, please. So that's settled. Let's go to bed now. It's like we're running away What will they say? Who cares what they say? I can't stay in such a hateful place. He's right. I don't want to stay here one more day How pathetic. They say «100 million of us all together». Japanese people are supposed to be united to fight the war, but look at this. We're going to lose. Japan will lose. We can't win. Bastards. Who's there? Thieves. Traitors. Just you wait. It's settled. We've got to move. A soldier in the next bed at the hospital invited me to visit his hometown. I'm going to ask him. He's from the countryside in Sendai. The countryside should be safe from air raids. Sendai was bombed. It's better than the Tokyo area. Sorry for your troubles. People around here weren't like this before. I'll be back as soon as I can. Please watch over my family while I'm gone. Don't worry. Take care. Where has Yuri gone? Well, I'm off now. Yuri. I'm going to Sendai. Take care of my family while I'm gone. What's wrong? Coward ! Why? Why don't you stay here? You don't have to run away You and your father are good to us. You're lying. You got bored here and you want to go somewhere else. Just go wherever you want. Yuri. I'm sorry but what else can we do? It's not like we want to go somewhere else. Then why don't you stay? Who cares what the villagers say We can't stay here. They're calling us thieves. They're the thieves. They're the vermin. I think so, too, but my mother and sisters are suffering. I'm in pain, too. Dad will miss you, too. Just the two of us in the mountains. Hideyuki, do you know how lonely it gets? I know. You don't. You can go wherever you want. Go away Go on. Yuri, I'll be back in several days. Don't come back. Get caught in an air raid and die. We're at war. I may get caught in an air raid and die. Then I'll die, too. I don't want to live in such a hateful village. I hate every single one of them. Go home. I'll miss the train if we keep chatting. Why don't you hurry then? Go on. Okay then let's run. Come on, run. Ouch. Come on, hurry All the young men are fighting in the war. He faked illness and came back. He's a thief. He can be so bold. And look at Yuri. Look at that. Yuri the slut looks so happy The whole of Japan is at war, and look at that. I'm glad our son didn't marry her. Let's go. We're glad she turned him down. If you get caught in an air raid, don't die. I'm not that slow. I wish the enemy planes would come here. They can bomb and destroy the village. Maybe they will. Maybe we'll lose the war. Go home before we go too far. It'll be a nice day tomorrow. It'll be sunny the day after tomorrow. And the next day And the next. Wherever we go, we can meet again. I'll visit you after the war. I'll be dead before then. It's boring to stay alive. Silly You're a child. Don't say that. I'm not a child. Come on. Go home. While I'm away watch over my family Don't worry I'll protect them with my life. Well, then. Go. I'll bring you a gift. I don't want anything. She's in love with you. No way You're kidding. The evacuees are from dog-eat-dog Tokyo. They can steal potatoes. I hear they vandalized all your signs. Not just the signs. They chop down our trees for firewood. Keep your guard up. No wonder their chimneys always smoking. They must have food to cook. While we're starving and sending food to the soldiers. They're stealing our crops. They're traitors. I looked into it and found their girl had been divorced. A shrew in lady's clothes. You liars! Bitch! Yuri! Stop! Stop! Yuri, stop! Alert! Alert! How insolent. August 6th The atomic bomb in Hiroshima. August 9th. Nagasaki was devastated by another atomic bomb. Japan was driven into a corner. People sensed the fate of Japan as each day it slid further into the abyss. With little help left, they worried for their future. They received more unexpected and distressing news. Go across the seas To be corpses in the water Go into the mountains To be corpses Upon which weeds grow Either way I stand by His Majesty, the Emperor On this day an official notice came to the village office. Eleven soldiers from this tiny remote village had been killed in the war. They all died on the same day. Bastards! Damn it! Stop it, dear. Listen, all my sons were killed in the war! He's drunk. Dear! You guys get rich in the black market! I'll kill you for my son! Dear! What's the Japanese Army doing? They're going to lose the war. They want our money They want our crops. We're losing one battle after another. They shouldn't have started the war. Horrible news today isn't it? I might have to go myself. They took our crops for the war. Now they've taken our husbands and sons. I'm busy going around offering condolences. I don't like the looks of that cloud. We might get caught in the rain. - Maybe you shouldn't go. - Let's go. We need more food. We're going over that mountain. It's quite far, isn't it? If only our neighbours shared food. I hate them. It looks like it's already raining over there. It'll be raining here soon. Go home. I don't mind getting wet. It's just a passing shower. Your backpack gets heavy when wet. The road gets bad, too. - Can you go alone? - I'll get food for the both of us. Don't overburden yourself. - Want a ride? - No, thank you. Why don't you go ahead? Don't talk smart. I can ride wherever I want. Go on, won't you? I can't just go on. Coward. You're lying right and left. How can you call yourself a man? Shut your big mouth! What are you doing? What are you doing? Help! Go away! Aren't you the mayor's son? Just because I'm a woman alone, what are you doing? Because I rejected you? Act like a man. My brother told me what you did in the war zone. That's why I turned you down. Then I'll do to you what you heard I did. You're a beast! You're a devil! This is what a devil does. What are you doing, you bastard! Bastard. Bastard. That's Goichi's horse. Yeah. What happened? Takamori's young master has been murdered! Come on, Tomikichi. What happened? That bastard Takamori attacked her. What did he do? He grabbed at her in the woods on the village border. I'd gone to get her when it started raining. That bastard. How the hell could he? Are you all right? It's all right now. Get her some clothes. I'll get you some water. You don't want to catch a cold. Drink this. I'm going to talk to the Mayor. We can't stay quiet after this. Just because her brother is away how dare he... Yuri, take care of her. Is your girl Yuri home? What do you want? We need her in the village. Wait a second. I need to talk to you. There are so many of you... What's your business with Yuri? Some nerve you've got. What? Yuri and the Sonobe girl killed Goichi Takamori. Don't bother with him. You bastards! You're not getting past me. Try to touch Miss Kieko. You'll pay for it. Idiot, you mean to fight the police? That's not it. It's just... Hideyuki's away If you do anything now, I'll have to intervene. I don't know if they killed the young master, but it's all his fault. You... Get out of the way Go. You bastards! Yuri! Shintaro, what are you doing? I'll shoot every one of you! Miss Kieko, are you all right? Get a hold of yourself. Yuri! Yuri, run with her to White Snows Cottage. Why do we have to run? Did you kill Takamori's young master? What? He died? Hurry You too, Miss Kieko. If you stay here, who knows what they'll do. Yuri, get some food and go. Okay. Shintaro, I didn't do anything wrong. Of course not. It's all their fault. Hurry up. They'll be back if you wait. Just in case. Scare them with this. I'm not running. Let's go to the police and they'll see who's wrong. You can say that, but they won't listen to you. If you get hurt, I can't face Hideyuki. But I have to see Mother! There will be hell to pay if the villagers catch you. Run away for now. I'll talk to them, then you can come back. Go now, Yuri. But... Hurry Yuri, make sure Miss Kieko doesn't get hurt. Yes, that's right. The Mayor's son was murdered. He's a tough old man. I need some backup. We can't wait for the police. Japan's fighting a big war. Our village lost 11 men in the war. They dared to kill my precious son. They forgot their gratitude to our village. They dared to kill an important Japanese man. I'm not taking this anymore. No one should complain if we kill those traitors. We can't wait. They might run. Mayor, we'll go catch them. Wait, we'd better wait for the police. What are you mumbling? They killed my son! - But... - Shut up, you old fart! Go away school teacher. None of your business, old man. They fired a shotgun. They're beasts. We can kill them. Good. I'll kill them. Don't instigate them. What if someone gets hurt? Stay out of this! They killed the heir to the Takamori family If you want to complain, tell it to my son's corpse. Look, we got him. What right have you got to do this? Stop talking smart. Son of a bitch! Poor thing. Who's poor? Think about the war dead. Those evacuees destroyed our village. That's right. Listen, everybody Our sons, killed in action, won't forget their home. But it's been trampled over by those bastards. Why are you taking the gun, dear? Have you gone mad? Shut up, bitch! Bastards! You're a father! What if you get hurt? Bastards! Stop. Wait. Stop. Don't do anything violent, I'm telling you. Out of the way Wait. Stop. Don't do anything violent. They're not only violent, they killed. We'll capture them. We'll have backup from headquarters. Wait for them. We villagers will avenge our own. There is the law. You mustn't be violent. Why are you calling us violent? Their shotgun scared you away We'll catch them for you. Don't force bamboo spears on us when you want to. That's right. It's our duty to defeat the traitors. This all happened because you left those vegetable thieves alone. Out of the way Coward, stay away Let's go. Wait. I'm telling you to wait. Wait. Don't go. Wait. Wait. Wait for me. Stupid idiots. Acting like it's a celebration. Hello. Hello. Mother! Mrs. Sonobe, wait. Mrs. Sonobe. It's dangerous to go outside. I know Kieko wants me. I have to go to her, especially now. Take me with you. What are you saying, Miss Kagari? Stay with your grandmother. You must go? I have to hold her in my arms. I know she's in pain, like she's dying. I must listen to her, and if I can, make her turn herself in. No way You've got no idea what the villagers would do to her. I won't have her come to this village. She can cross the pass and go to the police in the next village. Please watch after my mother-in-law. - I sure will. I'm counting on you. Kagari, you got that? - Mother. You mustn't cry You've got to be strong. Take this, Mrs. Sonobe. Don't let them see you. Take the back road. Grandmother. Shintaro, come out! Shintaro, come out! He's not here. He's gone. Get back on the horses. Let's go to the Salmon Cottage. Let's go. We'll catch them. Their faces shone with a naive vigour. Their skin bathed in the sun with a healthy glow. But they were losing a war day after day. They'd had years of oppression and hardship without freedom. They finally showed their true nature in their fever to follow each other. It was a mad flood of frustration storming toward an outlet. Let's stop here. It gets tricky for the horses. Give me a shotgun. A shotgun. Come on, let's go. Shintaro, come out if you're in there! What? You want to shoot us? I'll shoot you. I'll kill all the bullies. You want to fight against us villagers? Come to me, if you dare. So many of you... What do you want? Shut up and give us your daughter and the Sonobe girl. By what right do you demand that? If you want them, bring the police. Who cares. Let's get them. Shintaro. Bastard. - They've run away! - How dare you! - Where are they? - Go home! I'm not telling you anything. You know what happens to you when you hide murderers? What? How dare you bully innocent women and children. Are you really Japanese? Hey you saying I'm not a Japanese citizen, you bastard? I gave all my sons to the nation. You dare to say I'm not a Japanese citizen? It's not only you who's given up fathers and brothers. Two men from the Sonobe family are still fighting in the war. How dare you say this is your home front. Just try to point a finger at this family I won't allow you. No, I won't forgive you. Grandmother. Way to go! Burn down the house! It's dangerous. Don't go in there. You bastards, how dare you! Damn you. Damn you all. Put out the fire. Are you really human? Do you enjoy burning down other people's homes? If you have a conscience, be ashamed of yourselves. Don't you want to carry out a parcel or two? You're not human. If you're Japanese, Japan will lose the war. Die, you hag! Miss Kagari, I'm sorry it's come to this. You're in danger here. Let's run to White Snows Cottage. They killed Hama. Wait a second. They fired a shotgun and killed Hama. Miss Kagari. Let's chase down Shintaro. You guys take Hama's body to the village. Be careful. He might still be around. I know you'll miss us, but it's only for a short while. Please forgive us. Miss Kagari, hurry It's horrible! It's serious! There's trouble! - Something terrible happened. - Why are they ringing the bell? They say Takamori's son was killed by your sister and Yuri. They're hunting them in the mountains. Your brother's badly hurt. He was carried into the police station. Wait a moment. Take this horse. Thank you. - Please take this. - Go to them, now. All the villagers will do their best to assist you. You need to capture those bandits now. Civil Defence Volunteers, take action as we've just planned. We can't have any more casualties. Let's go now. Get out of the way Stay out of the way It's dangerous. Mr. Mayor, that young man may not make it. Why should I care? It's your fault. Villagers have been killed. Many were wounded. It's all your fault. Idiot! What are you doing? Let's not fight amongst ourselves. Stop it. Mother! Mother! Kieko. I can't. We're almost there. Once we cross that pass, we're safe. Come on. Hang in there. How's my brother? He's in there. Norio. What happened? Who killed my brother? We don't have time for that. What? Your family killed people and ran into the mountains. The villagers suffered death and injuries. That's ridiculous. Where's the Sonobes' son? They killed my husband. You idiot! Because of your family my husband was killed. What are you gonna do about it, bastard? What are you gonna do? Stop. Where are you going? Let me go. I'm worried about my family Stop. Don't go. Wait. Stop! Stop, I tell you! You. Stop. Are you running away? I'm not running away I don't want any more death. You need to stay put. No. If I'm there, my family won't do anything crazy Come with me if you want. All right. If you run, I'll get you. - Let's spread out. - Good. You, come this way You, this way Halt! Wait! Which way did they go? This way I think. They're trying to cross the pass. How dare they during wartime! You, stay here and join the Civil Defence Volunteers coming up. Over here! We found them! - Over there. - This way They found them. That way I'm going to take a look. Be careful. It's dangerous. Come on. Hang in there. Yuri, I'll hold them off here. You guide Miss Kagari over the pass. Quickly Go. Let's spread out. Don't come any closer, or I'll shoot! Mother. We must leave it up to God. We've done nothing wrong. Mother! Kagari. What about your Grandma? She says they killed her. They shot her with a shotgun. Come on, Mrs. Sonobe. Let's go. No, we don't have to run anymore. Let them kill us if that's what they want. We'll see if such a horrible act is allowed in the nation of Japan. Don't shoot for no reason! Why don't you go catch them, then? Damn it. What a bunch of troublemakers. You! Go around over there. If you want to come, send in the police! Dear God. Give up your futile resistance! Bastards. Yuri, watch out! Yuri! Kieko. Kieko. Don't come any closer! If you come any closer, I'll shoot. Aren't you human, too? You're killing people you used to see every day in the village. Doesn't your conscience bother you? Yuri! Mother. Yuri loved me... Seven people died that day. Japan surrendered two days later. All the Japanese people woke up from the nightmare. Among them were those who witnessed this tragedy. They swore silence to their souls and would not speak of it. Just a little more. Push. We finally made it. Wow. Thank you very much. Drive safe. We did it. Be careful. Let's go. Thank you very much. THE END
