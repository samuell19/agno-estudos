LET'S GO. WITH YOU? IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. THIS IT IT. EVERYTHING A MAN COULD WANT-- GOOD WATER, GRASS, PLENTY OF LAND. WHO'S IT BELONG TO? ME. START A FIRE. MAKE TWO LINES LIKE THIS FOR THE BANKS OF A RIVER, AND THE LETTER "D." YEAH. YOU GONNA PUT THAT BRAND ON MY COW, TOO? WELL, EVERY BULL NEEDS A COW, MATTHEW. UNLESS YOU KNOW A BETTER WAY TO START A HERD THAT'S SOMEDAY GONNA STRETCH OUT HERE AS FAR THE EYE CAN SEE. I SEE A "D" FOR "DUNSON" ON THAT BRAND. BUT THAT'S MY COW. WHERE'S THE "M" FOR "MATTHEW"? I'LL PUT IT ON THERE WHEN YOU'VE EARNED IT. FAIR ENOUGH. I'LL EARN IT. Matthew: THEY'RE GONNA GET AWAY! Dunson: WHEREVER THEY GO, IT'LL BE ON MY LAND. Cowboy: COME ON, COME ON! COME ON! GET HIM ON THE HEAD, LOREDO. Man: STILL DON'T SEE AN "M" ON THAT BRAND. I'LL PUT AN "M" ON THERE WHEN YOU EARNED IT. FAIR ENOUGH. WELCOME HOME, MATT.HEY, BUSTER. TAYLOR. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

YOUR COW AND MY BULL PRODUCED THE LARGEST HERD IN SOUTH TEXAS. WHERE THEY STAND, THEY'RE NOT WORTH A PLUGGED 3-CENT PIECE. WHAT HAPPENED?YANKEES. THE WAR SUCKED ALL THE GOLD OUT OF THE SOUTH. LAST YEAR TOM SWEATED BULLETS TO FILL ARMY BEEF CONTRACTS. AND WHAT'S HE GOT TO SHOW FOR IT? CONFEDERATE PAPER MONEY YOU CAN'T EVEN USE TO LIGHT A DUTCH OVEN WITH. DID I TELL YOU TO BELLYACHE FOR ME? WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE SAID THEY AIN'T WORTH A PLUGGED 3-CENT PIECE! YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT, IT SOUNDS WORSE. THAT'S 'CAUSE IT ISWORSE! THE ONLY CASH MARKET LEFT IS YANKEE LAND WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD TO CELEBRATE WHUPPIN' US OVER A GOOD TEXAS STEAK. BUT THAT WOULD MEAN DRIVING 'EM A THOUSAND MILES THROUGH THE DEVIL'S OWN HELL. NOBODY BUT TOM DUNSON'D GET SUCH A FOOL NOTION IN HIS HEAD. THE FIRST HERD THAT GETS TO THAT TRAILHEAD IS GONNA BRING TOP DOLLAR. AND JUST BECAUSE NOBODY'S DONE IT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T BE DONE. I'VE PUT TOO MUCH WORK INTO THIS THING TO LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO IT NOW. WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE GONNA TRY TO BE FIRST. WE CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGER. HE NEEDS ANOTHER DAY TO ROUND 'EM UP. I FIGURE SAN SABA TO MERIDIAN, THEN ALONG THE BRAZOS. THE WAR DIDN'T TEACH HIM EVERYTHING. YOUR WAY IS 60 MILES LONGER. I PATROLLED THAT COUNTRY DURING THE RIVER CAMPAIGN. THERE'S GOOD WATER CLEAR TO THE RED. ONE WAY TO SETTLE IT. DRAW! HA HA HA! OH HO! HE BEAT YA, TOM! HE BEAT YA! FIRST TIME! THE BOY IS A MAN! AND JUST A MITE FASTER.

I'M GONNA DRIVE THE WHOLE HERD TO MISSOURI, AND WHEN I COME BACK, I'LL GIVE YOU AND THE OTHERS $2 A HEAD FOR 'EM. SAY, USE ANOTHER HAND ON THAT DRIVE? WE CAN ALWAYS FIND ROOM FOR ANOTHER GOOD MAN. MATTHEW'S MY RAMROD. HE WANTS A MAN, HE GETS HIM. WAGE IS $10 A MONTH, IT'LL BE TRIPLE THAT IF WE GET $15 AT THE TRAILHEAD. WE LOSE THE HERD, YOU LOSE YOUR WAGES. FAIR ENOUGH. GOOD LUCK, CHERRY. GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YA. THANKS, MR. MEEKER. TAKE CARE OF YOUR NEW MAN. I FIGURED YOU'D NEVER HIRE ANOTHER BUCK ON THE PROD. UNLESS YOU'RE LIKE ME... LOOKIN' FOR DANGER. I'M NOT LOOKIN' FOR ANYTHING BUT A GOOD COWBOY. WELL, THEN, I APPRECIATE IT... RAMROD. YEAH, WELL, YOU MAY BE CURSIN' ME INSTEAD BEFORE WE EVER GET THIS HERD OUT OF TEXAS. PROBABLY WILL. THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKIN' PIECE YOU WERE ABOUT TO USE BACK THERE. CAN I SEE IT? MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE MINE. AIN'T NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN A GOOD GUN. EXCEPT A SWISS WATCH AND...

LET'S TALK ABOUT A FEW OTHER THINGS WHILE WE'RE AT IT. MOST OF YOU ARE ITCHING TO GET UP THAT TRAIL 'CAUSE YOU GOT NO JOB, NO PAY, NO CHOICE.

SOME OF YOU MAY GET HURT, MAYBE KILLED. BUT NOTHIN'S GONNA STOP US. WE'RE GONNA GET THERE ON STRICT TRAIL DISCIPLINE. MY WORD'S GONNA BE THE ONLY LAW THERE IS. WHEN YOU SIGN ON, YOU AGREE TO GO ALL THE WAY. THERE'LL BE NO QUITTING-- NOT BY YOU, AND NOT BY ME. THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SIGN ON, MR.

I'M GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WALK YOU TO YOUR WAGON? IF IT WOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE. I'D BE HONORED. THE STARS SURE ARE BEAUTIFUL. WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOUR MR. VALANCE JUST SAID THAT TO ME. HE DID? SOMETHING LIKE IT. AND YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR WHAT YOU SAID TO THAT YOUNG COWBOY. AND YET YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE IN A WAR TO PRESERVE SLAVERY. I NEVER WANTED THAT WAR. AND I DIDN'T JOIN UP TO KEEP SLAVERY. IT'S JUST THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WORTH FIGHTING FOR-- YOUR LAND, YOUR FAMILY... I ONCE THOUGHT THAT THAT INCLUDED PRIDE AND...HONOR. I'M NOT SO SURE ANYMORE. YOUR HUSBAND WAS KILLED? LAST THING I DID BEFORE I HEADED WEST WAS TO FIND THE UNION CEMETERY HE WAS BURIED IN. THEY HAD THE RECORDS ALL MIXED UP. I NEVER DID FIGURE OUT WHICH GRAVE WAS HIS. I GUESS IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE'S STILL DEAD. WOULD YOU LIKE ME HOLD YOU FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE? I'M SORRY. THANK YOU FOR WALKING WITH ME. GOOD NIGHT. IF DUNSON PICKS UP SOME MEN IN PRESTON HE COULD BE CLOSE AS... FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AWAY. SO WHAT YOU GONNA DO ABOUT THAT WAGON TRAIN? THEY CAN'T SLOW US THAT MUCH. ANOTHER TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY'LL BE CLEAR OF THE COMANCHES. THAT FIRST DAY... I'D HAVE KILLED YOU WITHOUT BLINKING AN EYE. AIN'T GONNA BE SO EASY NOW... NOW THAT WE GOT SOMETHING BETWEEN US. WHAT'S THAT? SHE'S A QUALITY WOMAN. LYIN' HERE, I MOSTLY BEEN THINKING OF HER. YEAH. SHE DOES SEEM A WHOLE LOT PRETTIER THAN THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER. I HAD MY SHARE OF PRETTY WOMEN, NOW, YOU KNOW, GIVE 'EM A SHINY TRINKET OR... DEPENDIN' ON THE KIND SHE IS, SOME HARD CASH. YOU COULD HAVE HER ALL NIGHT. BUT A QUALITY WOMAN, NOW, THAT'S A DIFFERENT PROPOSITION. HER... YOU GOT TO GIVE SOMETHING INSIDE YOURSELF, SOMETHING YOU AIN'T WILLING TO GIVE TO NOBODY ELSE. BUT I AIN'T NEVER HAD ME A...QUALITY WOMAN. RIFLE CASINGS AND INDIAN SIGNS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER, WHEEL TRACKS, AND NOW THIS CAMP. LOOKS TO ME LIKE SOME WAGON TRAIN RAN INTO COMANCHES. AND NOW THEY'RE TRAILING ALONG WITH THE HERD. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ONLY TWO OR THREE DAYS BEHIND, BOYS. LET'S GO. I GOT THAT WHEEL THERE! I'M TELLING YOU, MATT, THEY'RE SLOWING US DOWN. WHY DON'T YOU LET US LEAD? AND HAVE ALL THESE WOMEN AND CHILDREN EATING OUR DUST ALL DAY? TWO OR THREE DAYS WE'LL BE OUT OF INJUN TERRITORY. THEN WE'LL SEE. IF YOU SAY. YOU KNOW DUNSON BETTER THAN I DO. A FEW MORE HOURS AND WE'LL STOP FOR THE NIGHT. OFFICER GARTH, I HAVEN'T CRIED SINCE THE DAY THE SOLDIERS CAME TO TELL ME. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED. YOU WERE A STRANGER. I HAD NO RIGHT TO BURDEN YOU. I'M GLAD YOU DID. MA'AM. "THE PRINCE LIFTED HER IN HIS ARMS "AND PLACED HER ON HIS WHITE HORSE, "AND OFF THEY RODE TOGETHER, TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER." NOW, OFF YOU GO. THIS IS MY FAVORITE DESERT FLOWER. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT KIND IT IS, BUT... IT PUTS ME IN MIND OF YOU.OH, CHERRY-- DON'T. DON'T SAY ANYTHING. JUST TAKE 'EM. THANK YOU. I PUT IT IN THERE DIRT ROOTS AND ALL SO IT'LL GO ON LIVIN' FOR YA. I-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I-- I-I DON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, MA'AM. YOU'RE THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT--THAT... I COULD SPEND THE REST OF MY DAYS WITH... STOP ROVIN', PUT DOWN MY ROOTS, JUST LIKE THAT DESERT FLOWER. CHERRY, I--YOU'RE GONNA NEED A MAN. YOU COULD DO A WHOLE LOT WORSE THAN CHERRY VALANCE. CHERRY, I'M FLATTERED, HONORED THAT YOU'D FEEL THE WAY YOU DO ABOUT ME. BUT IT'S TOO SOON FOR ME TO EVEN THINK OF PLEDGING MYSELF TO ANOTHER MAN. NOT EVEN...MATTHEW GARTH? CERTAINLY NOT TO A MAN WHO SERVED IN AN ARMY THAT KILLED MY HUSBAND. NOW, PLEASE, I APPRECIATE THE FLOWER-- YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME... JUST LIKE I WANT YOU. AND YOU MIGHT ADMIT AS MUCH. IF I WAS SOME BIG CATTLEMAN WITH A FAT 20-BUCKS-A-COW HERD IN MYHIP POCKET-- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. NOW THAT I HAVE FOUND YOU... I AIN'T ABOUT TO LOSE YOU. NO MATTER WHAT. MAYBE THAT STORM AIN'T COMIN' IN TONIGHT. THEY KNOW IT. THEY AIN'T PAYIN' IT NO MIND. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'M TIRED OF BEIN' SOMEBODY'S HIRED GUN. THIS MAY BE THE ONLY CHANCE I'LL EVER HAVE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? I'M GOING TO MAKE MATTHEW GARTH DRAW ON ME... KILL HIM, AND TAKE THE HERD. ARKANSAS RIVER! IT'S SIX MILES UP AHEAD! WE'VE ALREADY CROSSED THE BORDER! WE GOT THE FIRST CATTLE INTO KANSAS SINCE THE END OF THE WAR! YEAH! WELL, RIDE ON BACK AND SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS. ALL RIGHT! YEE-HAW! LONG STRETCH TO NIGHT CAMP. SEE IF YOU CAN'T TIGHTEN THE MARCH. DO IT YOURSELF. I AIN'T YOUR RAMROD NO MORE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? DEMOTED MYSELF TO COWBOY, THAT'S WHAT. THAT'S THE WAY I WANT IT. HO! HO, HO, HO. ONE MORE DAY. WHY'D YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT? LIKE WHAT? YOU GAVE ME A BAD LOOK. I DID NOT.I SAY YOU DID. ANYBODY CALLS ME A LIAR BETTER GET READY TO GO FOR HIS GUN. NOW, YOU BACK OFF. HE DIDN'T LOOK AT YOU OR CALL YOU NOTHIN'. YOU SAYIN' MY FRIEND'S A LIAR? I THINK YOU AND YOUR LITTLE YELLOW PUP BETTER GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES AND TELL MY FRIEND YOU'RE SORRY. YOU TOUCH THAT RIFLE, OLD MAN, YOU'VE MADE YOUR LAST SOURDOUGH BISCUIT. AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' TO DO WITH YOU BOYS. JUST HIM AND ME. MATT! IT'S CHERRY! ALL RIGHT, YOU HEAD ON BACK TO YOUR WAGON. GO ON! YOU HEARD ME. ON YOUR KNEES. I AIN'T GONNA DO THAT. YOU THINK YOU'RE A MAN? HUH? I AIN'T GONNA DO IT. GIVE HIM YOUR GUN. YOU STRAP THAT ON AND YOU BE A MAN. CHERRY. STAY OUT OF THIS, MATTHEW. I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU. HE WAS A SLAVE. HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO EVEN HANDLE A GUN. NEXT TIME I LOOK... THAT NIGGER BETTER BE GONE, OR HE'S DEAD. MR. GARTH... I THINK IT'D BE BEST IF I JUST LEAVE. AIN'T NO USE IN NOBODY DYIN' OVER THIS. NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE BUT THE MAN WHO THINKS HE CAN PUSH PEOPLE WITH A GUN. YOU CALLIN' ME A DIRTY KILLER? YOU APOLOGIZE. NOW. NOW! MATTHEW! MATTHEW! MATTHEW! MATTHEW, WAIT! OH, MATT, I AM SO SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO CHERRY TO MAKE HIM CRAZY, BUT NO WOMAN IS WORTH DYING FOR! Matt: ...DUST TO DUST. IN SURE AND CERTAIN HOPE OF THE RESURRECTION UNTO ETERNAL LIFE. WE BROUGHT NOTHING INTO THIS WORLD, AND IT'S CERTAIN WE CAN TAKE NOTHING OUT. THE LORD GAVE, AND THE LORD HATH TAKEN AWAY. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. AMEN. Matt: BOOTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN ME OFF, MR. GARTH. I'M GONE. YOU ARE GONE IF YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD AGAINST JACK OR ANYBODY ELSE. BUT IF YOU STILL WANT TO GO WITH US TO ABILENE, YOU'LL GET YOUR PAY, JUST LIKE THE REST. THANK YOU, MR. GARTH. MR. GROOT TOLD US ABOUT DUNSON. YOU'VE DONE ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR US. PLEASE, PUSH ON AHEAD. DOES THERE HAVE TO BE MORE KILLING? GET YOUR HERD TO MARKET, AND THEN DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT DUNSON. PLEASE. 'EVENING, GENTLEMEN. WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS? YOU TRAVELING WITH A TRAIL HERD? WHO WANTS TO KNOW? THOMAS DUNSON. I'M A RANCHER FROM TEXAS. THE HERD'S MINE. THESE MEN HERE ARE DEPUTIZED TO HELP PUNISH THE THIEVES. HOW FAR AHEAD ARE THEY? DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT OR WRONG OF THIS IS, MISTER. THEY SAVED US FROM THE COMANCHES. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S RIGHT TO HELP YOU HUNT 'EM DOWN, BUT YOU AND YOUR MEN ARE WELCOME TO SHARE WHAT'S IN OUR POT. WELL, THEY CAN'T BE TOO FAR AHEAD. MR. DUNSON. I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING. ABOUT MATTHEW GARTH. IT'S YOUR BEEF IN THE POT, SO THERE'S NO NEED TO LET PRIDE STOP YOU. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, GO AHEAD AND EAT. AMY, PLEASE GO ASK COLONEL PRUITT FOR A PLATE FOR MR. DUNSON. YOU LOOK TRAIL-WORN, SIR. I HAVE SOME MEDICINAL WHISKEY. WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOME? YOU TRYIN' TO KILL ME WITH KINDNESS? MORE OR LESS. MATTHEW LEFT WITH YOUR COWS TWO DAYS AGO. THAT IS WHAT YOU WANTED TO KNOW. IF I CAN BELIEVE YOU. I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT. WELL. THATI CAN BELIEVE. YOU INTEND TO KILL HIM, AND YOU NEED THEM TO HELP YOU. NO, I DON'T NEED THEM TO HELP ME, AND, YES, I DO INTEND TO KILL HIM. WHY? BECAUSE HE TOOK YOUR HERD TO SAVE IT FROM YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE. MR. DUNSON, DO YOU REALLY KNOW MATTHEW GARTH? YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT. 16 YEARS. AND YET IN A FEW DAYS AND NIGHTS, I THINK I KNOW HIM BETTER. HE HATED GOING AGAINST YOU, BUT HE DID IT OUT OF LOVE. LIKE HELL HE DID. I RAISED HIM AS MY OWN SON IN ALL BUT NAME. EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE HIS-- LAND, CATTLE, ALL OF IT, AND HE SPIT ON IT. AND HE SPIT ON ME. NOW, A MAN DOES THAT TO ME, I'M GOING TO KILL HIM. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. SIMPLE. AND FOOLISH. YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT? THE WAY YOU TALK. THAT GUN YOU GOT OVER THERE IN THAT BOX. IF YOU THOUGHT-- I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING. BUT I WOULD HAVE TRIED, STUPIDLY, JUST AS YOU WILL WHEN YOU FIND MATTHEW. YOU KNOW, I HAD A WOMAN FELT THAT WAY ABOUT ME ONCE. I LOST HER. NOW I GOT NEITHER WIFE NOR SON. I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE IN THE DARK AND CATCH A FEW HOURS' SLEEP. YOU WANT TO KILL ME... YOU'LL HAVE YOUR CHANCE. Buster: I'M BEGINNING TO THINK WE'RE LOST. EITHER THAT, OR THERE AIN'T NO SUCH A PLACE AS ABILENE. WE'RE GONNA WIND UP IN CANADA, DRIVING THIS HERD UP AND DOWN AN ICEBERG. WE'LL FIND IT. IF WE DO, BE AWFUL TOUGH IF THE RAILROAD AIN'T THERE. IT'S GOTTA BE THERE. BUT IF IT AIN'T? WE'LL KEEP DRIVING TILL WE FIND IT. OR TILL DUNSON FINDS US. WHOA. WHAT WAS THAT? I HEARD SOMETHING. YEE-HAW! Man: MAKE WAY! MAKE WAY! WE'RE COMING IN! WHOO-HAH! LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! MOVE OVER! MOVE OVER! LOOK OUT! Woman: HI, BOYS! WHOA. WHOA. OKAY, MOVE ALONG. MOVE ALONG. Man: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. Melville: I HOPE YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE, MR. GARTH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD'VE DONE IF YOU HADN'T HUNG OUT A WELCOME SIGN. LET'S TALK A LITTLE BUSINESS. MR. GARTH--MAKE THAT MATT. MATT? I AM THE GREENWOOD TRAINING COMPANY OF ILLINOIS, AND I'D LIKE TO BUY YOUR HERD. THE WHOLE SHOOTIN' MATCH? EVERY LAST COW. WHAT'S YOUR PRICE? UH... I'M KIND OF NEW AT THIS. CAN YOU MAKE ME AN OFFER? ALL RIGHT. $20. A HEAD? MR. MELVILLE, YOU JUST BOUGHT YOURSELF A HELL OF A LOT OF BEEF! I'D GET THAT CONDUCTOR TO BLOW HIS WHISTLE AGAIN IF HE WAS HERE, BUT BEIN' AS HE AIN'T... YEE-HAW! MAN'S GOT A RIGHT TO SCREAM LIKE THAT THREE TIMES IN HIS LIFE-- WHEN HE MARRIES, WHEN HIS KIDS ARE BORN... AND WHEN HE FINISHES A JOB HE WAS CRAZY TO START. WELL, MATT, YOU'VE MADE TOM DUNSON RICH. THAT'S ALL YOU OWE HIM. YOU GOT ME AND THREE SADDLE MATES RIGHT HERE IF YOU DECIDE TO RIDE NORTH. I KNOW THAT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF I DON'T GET IN LINE FOR THAT BATH, I'M GOING TO HELL SMELLING LIKE A SKUNK. YOU GUYS GO ON AND ENJOY YOURSELF. Buster: WHERE'S THAT SALOON? I WANT TO MEET THEM PURDY LADIES! COME IN. HEY. WHAT'S THE MATTER? IT'S JUST THAT... I WANT YOU ALIVE. COME WITH ME. THERE'S A GOOD LIFE IN COLORADO. I KNOW, I KNOW. I WANT THAT TOO. BUT IF I DON'T-- IF I CAN TURN MY BACK ON MY PAST, WHY CAN'T YOU? 'CAUSE IF I DON'T FACE HIM, I'D NEVER BE A MAN THAT YOU COULD LOVE. THAT IS SUCH A FOOLISH THING TO SAY. I'D LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID. THEN YOU'LL LOVE ME IF I HAVE TO DO THIS. MR. GROOT! MR. GROOT! HE'S COMING... AND HE'S ALONE. GO TELL MATTHEW. Groot: NOW HOLD ON A MINUTE AND THINK ABOUT THIS-- HE GOT YOU TOP DOLLAR. DRAFT'S IN YOUR NAME. HE DID IT FOR YOU, TOM. YOU STAY OUT OF IT. GO ON, MATTHEW. DRAW. I SAID DRAW. WHAT KIND OF MAN ARE YOU? NOW, YOU TOLD ME ONCE NEVER TO DO THAT TO YOU AGAIN. BY GOD, I'LL GET YOU TO FIGHT. ALL RIGHT, STAY THERE IN THE DIRT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. THE REST OF YOU-- YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF COW THIEVES. I'M GONNA SEE YOU ALL HANG! GO ON, GET UP. DAMN YOU! HAVE YOU NO SENSE AT ALL? LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING-- TRYING TO KILL WITH YOUR FISTS THE PERSON YOU LOVE. YES, YOU LOVEEACH OTHER. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YET?
