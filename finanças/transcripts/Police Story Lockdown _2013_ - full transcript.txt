You must have been exhausted Why did you do this? Ask why the police took so long, instead No one called them Everyone thought, I don't want to be involved Do you know what you're doing? Kidnapping's a felony. At least ten years in jail Where is my daughter? Miao? Waiting in the hall. She's a good girl Don't talk about her She never said her dad's a cop That makes you a bad dad, and a bad cop Am I your real target? Sir, the police are at the door Ignore them. Wait downstairs So you called the police Sorry, I used your phone I answered a call from your lieutenant I described the situation. He'll be here soon You were military, over 20 accomplished years with local, regional, casework, and SWAT Penalized once, which you applied for yourself You've done your homework Too bad you couldn't handle your family After all these years, your pay is so low A year's pay for a tiny house. Was it worth it? You don't get it. Some things are priceless Lieutenant is still on his way No hurry. We'll talk when he arrives. Tell me your demands now Don't tell me what to do Hostages are hurt. The police won't be patient I'm patient enough Say what you need to say Fine. You're my target Guess why? I've made many enemies Last year, car thieves sold their loot nearby We're short-staffed today, so let's stick to the plan There's one outside, five inside The white-haired one is the leader Do you know White Hair? Yue. Everyone here knows him Freeze! Police! Stop! Watch them Yue is known to be vicious You'll suffer if you try to capture him by yourself Please let me go I'll capture you myself Just you wait. Your time will come I'll wait for you You did this for him, right? I've heard of those guys They're ranked too low Most people use threats to boost egos I agree Lieutenant, you're here I'm chatting with Capt. Zhong. He's fine I want $80 - 90 million in non-sequential bills Don't threaten me and talk about difficulty Wu, I don't know what you want Make a reasonable demand Lieutenant has a bad temper Don't get your hopes up. If we can do it, we will Take it easy on him You don't want money Fine, I'll be frank I want to see someone It's easy for you to find people But my friend lives far away I haven't seen him in a while You want to know why? You'll see Not your call? Why are you wasting my time? Calm down, let's talk it out Talk it out? You're trying to bluff? Don't bother I forgot you'd been shot I'm curious. What's it like? It's like taking a vicious hit with a stick I couldn't find my shoulder or this side Then, this pain that sears through your heart I've felt that searing pain What happened to your leg? It was long ago The dark green pickup ahead Pull over Two suspects are in the truck- the leader's a cripple. Should be the one in the back seat Have you ever kidnapped anyone? The hostage is in there. Don't shoot Captain Zhong, we're going Stay safe Take care of them Don't worry I'll chase them Call dispatch. We need backup That's a better attitude Are you really bad at small talk, or just acting? Fine. My only demand is to see that person Not "we'll try." It's a "must." Confirm in five minutes We're in no hurry. Let's chat How are they? Chao is fine. Hai broke his arm The backup cars will catch up soon Don't be afraid. I'm a policeman Be brave. Mr. Policeman will come soon Stay put Where's the other guy? Too bad we couldn't save the driver The main perpetrator is still on the loose Not a bad story, but you guessed wrong I despise people who kidnap children The trip shouldn't take more than three hours Traffic's smooth at this hour The hostage? Emotionally stable, pragmatic Sure. I'll be on lookout Taozi, come up. Keep your eyes on him Calm down. Play some relaxing music Let me have a taste Why? For courage? Take it easy, this stuff is strong What's going on? What's wrong, Niu? Heart attack Is there a doctor here? Do you know how? Hospital I'll go with you to the hospital We must get to a hospital. He can't die Shut up I'm a doctor. I must go with him to hospital! Out of the way! I'm fine. It comes and goes. What a phony! 25 YEARS POLICE SERVICE WITH 22 MERITORIOUS AWARDS HOSTAGE INCIDENT — A KIDNAPPED WOMAN WAS THREATENED BY KNIFE Where are they? Honestly, I'm anxious to see him I warn you, if my friend isn't here All the cops you bring will be useless Procedure isn't my concern What, you want to come in? No need I'm a man of my word Wu Jiang When my guy arrives, Wu Jiang, the hostages will be fine come here Except Captain Zhong Wu Jiang Listen! You won't get out but you can make other requests Open up What do you want? I need the restroom Anything else? Boss Wu, may I interview you? Sure Get out Dad, you're here! Are you okay? Sorry, Dad, forgive me I dressed up like that to upset you I didn't show I cared. You're much prettier now Put this away for me Be careful, Dad Where can I get a phone? They took all our phones They're on the table in the hall But… Hurry up! I'm Zhu Nan, host of the Life Channel I risked my life for this Exclusive at a kidnapping Here's the mastermind behind this case Can I say that? You must have a great story, Boss Wu. Say hello Hands off. I want a drink. So what? Let's continue Do you feel that I'm insane for doing this? No. Why are you committing this crime? I just did what no one else dares Let me go I'm not done with the interview. Look — Are you done? You were nice to me to get my dad here If you must say that You're using me I'm not a good guy, your dad's not a good cop. Neither of us can make you feel safe. This is Zhong Wen. I stole a cell phone Are you safe now? I'm fine. I'm hiding What's going on? There are over a dozen hostages There were four suspects. I got rid of one The boss, Wu, is the leader. He has a knockoff 64 What are his demands? He wants to see a prison detainee What's the name? Wei Xiaofu Wei Xiaofu Chief has agreed and is making arrangements We've made a plan with snipers and SWAT Are conditions suited for a SWAT assault? The bar is two stories tall. The hostages are in a cage, watched by the three suspects If we attack now It'll be too dangerous for the hostages They may have other weapons Understood We may attack at any time Boss, that guy escaped I have to go Find him! Useless fool He's here Is that all you've got? I bet you still can't handle him Brother Zhong, you're amazing But aren't you worried about your daughter? Miao said, you used to be her hero How'd you become a deserter? Let's talk In your own words, let's talk openly Dad, don't worry about me I wanted her in my "law of the jungle" experiment Don't come out, Dad Sure, you must think in your dark corner but fingertips don't grow back Stop Dad, don't come Don't come Let her go. Target me Now you're like a good father, but it's too late Stop I'm fine Give him room. So, you're here on a case Where were you? Were we in any danger? Lady! Stop saying stupid things What did I say? You don't stop talking! So annoying! With this scoop, she'll be promoted tomorrow None of your business I'm fine Let me go. Do you think I can escape? I'm sure you will. You'll be fine From my experience, he'll release us soon In all kidnappings — They'd be killing the hostages now It's usually about money I know Wu well. He's rich. It's more than that Is there a back door here? - There's just this door - Boss designed the bar. He sealed the back door What does your father do? He's a policeman Such hatred, beating him so badly. Must be over a girl Don't worry. We don't know him I know you The drug store The thief- he stole from me That's right I didn't recognize you without your uniform She was there that day, too That's Lan, now a manager at the nightclub And the famous Boss Niu. We were all there Something happened inside Captain Zhong is in there. What happened? We're together again. That's destiny Cut the nonsense Comrade Policeman, what's your issue with Wu? Talk it out with him. Why involve us? Destiny, my foot Chief Zhang, a high official I'm so honored. They're all fine You want to see them, right? Look. They're lively and well-fed I am Police Chief Zhang Guomin. Don't worry I'll do my best to help you Go ahead, Boss Wu. We'll wait Film this area and the people My friend isn't here. You're unreliable Give us more time. Several reasons — I don't care. You have five minutes Show some respect. Five more minutes If he's not here in ten minutes, I'll get violent Please come, Boss Wu I want to talk to you Go ahead Alone Our usual place Zhong, what more is there to say? You just want us. Why involve innocents? I need more chips And how do you know they're innocent? What do want to say? You created an elaborate plot Yes But you can't win with your way We'll see You need a middleman. I can help A cop helping a criminal. What a joke What do you want to know from that case? I don't want to discuss that now Then we'll wait for Wei Xiaofu You ask lots of questions. My turn You cops don't see much of this, do you? We see all kinds How many cases have you been on? Lots. Over 100 a year How many cops die in a year? About 400 die in the line of duty in China And how many hostages? Accidents happen Will there be an accident today? I don't want casualties today Including me? Yes. Every life is precious I stopped believing that long ago Although you've done your homework Zhong, you sneaked into my secret chamber So you know some of my secrets You can see this is beyond negotiation So we have nothing to talk about I see you're a boxer I've got some time. Let me tell you a story You asked what happened to my leg As a boy, I went overseas with my father He killed himself due to gambling debts. I had to repay them The only skill I had there was fighting I had always fought on others' behalf Fighting over who's more vicious I never had a worthy opponent You risk your life for money but life is so worthless and fleeting I swore to stop once I repaid the debts So during that time I was like a crazy man I finally repaid all the debts but I didn't want to do anything else It was all about money, life and death So I continued You may be killed by your opponent at any time My nickname was Spider. I never lost, but a spider is an insignificant bug Illegal boxers are the same I knew your men from boxing The foreigners were the best in their countries The shorter one, Pichon, is a regular champion Everyone wanted us to fight I know it's inevitable Before the fight, I felt the bets were too big The better fighter you are, the more you're worth and the closer to death you are What happened at that fight? In the beginning we were even Then he got the upper hand Next round, he'll let you win The two bosses arranged everything I found out just before the final round It was a fight to the death Next round, kill him Boss didn't know my heart was soft that day I'd decided to return to China after that fight and bring some fighters to help me Poor Pichon only knew he was to lose I told him he had been fixed to die Disobeying the boss meant death So several of us escaped and hid for a time We're lucky to be here, alive Why did you suddenly go soft? As you say, you don't get it You've lived quite a life But one can't treat another's life lightly Everyone has the right to live To live well You know why I'm still alive? You came back to China five years ago just for the drugstore robbery For the truth The world is full of lies Is this the only way to find the truth? I should say, it's my way Don't sit Don't sit Amazing! You almost succeeded This bulletproof glass is worth every penny It's a police rescue effort, you'd do the same Your plan was good, snipers and SWAT together but I'm no amateur thief Why didn't you let me sit? I wanted to save you You want to help me and save me He's on screen - There were gunshots - Chief Zhang, I'm still alive Your Captain Zhong? He also lives Cut the nonsense. Let me see Wei Xiaofu Why did you get me here so late at night? Get him in here to see me You're kidding! I don't want to go in It's against the rules to bring a prisoner here Please know we must guarantee his safety You're tricking me You must see Wei Xiaofu, right? Let me break it down for you You're armed, took hostages and are at a stalemate I can kill some hostages And I'll make sure you'll never see Wei The police will find another way to attack What are you saying? Only I can help you to see him He trusts me. I can try to bring him in I'll talk to him, and you free the hostages. Think on it Life is like a cocktail What might the next sip taste like? I've filmed everything you told me to Trust my skills And if you don't come back? Trust me, I will But you must guarantee Wei's safety You dare to trust my guarantee? Trust is mutual Take two people. Your daughter stays I said, all the hostages Impossible. I must keep some I know which ones. Let the rest go No No deal Three No deal You can only bring three hostages Put down your gun You two have hot tempers Here. You two fight. You win, I promise you can bring people out You lose, go alone Dad, you're hurt You can't defeat him. Don't fight You're not young anymore It's embarrassing to lose. Never mind Why? Fight! You're a cop! Good prevails over evil Take us out Fine Agreed Comrade Police, it's all on you! Go, go! Be careful, Dad In a few seconds, you won't be able to get up This fight is too hard We can't benefit from his loss. Pray for him Captain Zhong, there's no shame in giving up Stop playing the hero, Dad Zhong, give up if you can't handle it Dad, stop! You can't beat them Get up, Cop Go, Mr. Policeman! Beat him How suspenseful He is good Stop, Dad Stay down or you'll die Stop fighting We don't want to go out anymore Cop, we're moved. You tried your best Mr. Policeman, we don't want to go anymore Stop, don't get up Please stop fighting, I'm begging you Don't let go! Hang on tight! He can't last! Harder! Careful, Cop Cop, let go! Watch out Let go. You won You won Give me your scarf Don't lock up again! Aren't we all going? Here's an idea I'll take my daughter out first When Wei Xiaofu comes in, she may go I'm not going anywhere I'm staying with my dad till the end Don't regret it As agreed, I'll give you the man you want Bring three people with you first Why change now? This is too much It's leverage in case you don't come back I'll release them just before Wei comes in That's not a change. Choose the hostages Wu, I really can't go on. I'll forfeit the money My health is poor. May I be one of them? Wu, if you think I'm useful to you I'll stay I'll go out to film, okay? Have you decided? The two injured hostages, and him You Me? Just me? No, I'm staying with my girlfriend Only you dared make a move. We need more men like you I'll make an exception. Go together Hurry You're a casualty: you lost a tooth Just me? We're inseparable I owe him money, I need to pay him outside You'd have enough to pay if you'd drink less Captain Zhong, you must return Zhong, You have ten minutes. I'm very punctual Hostages are coming! We need a stretcher There are four more This is a suspect- cuff him You saved my life Cheers for the Policeman! There are more people back here Are you badly hurt I'm okay. It's minor, Chief Zhang Check out these suspects Three suspects and three guns Where are they located? In the main hall, with 16 hostages Physical conditions of the hostages? All right But they can't last much longer mentally Lieutenant I felt you took action too soon just now Captain Zhong, the suspect wants to talk to you I'll tell you everything I know Speak I did this for money I never imagined he'd make such a big deal Please don't go in. You'll never get back out They told me they don't expect to get out alive That's all I know Thank you, sir These are from the building's management We have eight more minutes It differs from the blueprint- the windows are sealed This door is made with 25cm-thick steel panels The walls are 50cm thick There was a back door but it's been sealed He's from building management How could you allow all these changes? It's private property, out of our jurisdiction Fine. I'll call if I need you He's really built himself a fortress Over here? You can go in from the roof here and be hidden Seven more minutes This is a homemade bomb with a timer The wiring is complex, with multiple detonators He means to blow up everyone, including himself There are so many hostages The best way to save them is for me to bring Wei in Trading two people for 12. Has he agreed to go in? I was on the phone with my mother She wants me to behave, to try for early release Please help us It's too risky Your safety is a concern It may be dangerous, but we'll try our best Help us. We'll apply to reduce your sentence I still feel unsafe. Forget it We can't force you to take a risk like this Thanks for taking care of my mom all these years I promised years ago that I would Everyone on our team donated to your family I'm touched Here's the information on the suspects Bin, a Thai Pichon, a Filipino Wu Jiang returned five years ago, as a Thai The victim Mei's parents were divorced The mother died, a brother went overseas with the father I think Wu Jiang is Mei's brother He's not asking for Wei Xiaofu's release Three of the hostages were witnesses back then I think he wants to know what happened Cops, criminals, witnesses: all here It's been five years You have four more minutes Let's talk method We'll dress as Zhong and Wei. SWAT stands by First, cut open the roof by laser The door opens, we attack from above and below It's hard to attack through the crack in the door This way, we get their attention Roof-cutting time varies. We'll endanger the hostages Hostage safety comes first Let me negotiate again You can't- lives are at stake. Talk is useless This is too major. It calls for a hard-core assault Assaults are most risky now And you're not taking a risk by going back in? Keeping my promise will build trust. There's still a chance to talk You've been talking for six hours Some negotiations last months, you know No We got injured hostages out with talking Lieutenant was looking out for you Trading two for 12, good deal See? As Lieutenant, I should go in, not you It's my case, the same one as five years ago I'm most suited to go in Besides, my daughter's inside Shouldn't he stay away for that reason? Stop arguing Zhong should go back in But get a substitute for Wei Wu will know at a glance Chief Zhang, please come here Repeat what I say. "Three more minutes." The thug says — What? Boss Wu says, three more minutes "If he doesn't come, you will die" "If he doesn't come, I will die" "No joke" "No joke." He's really not joking, please help! Less than three minutes now Chief Zhang, Wei Xiaofu has agreed to go in Reason? One, to repay our favor Two, he doesn't want to be evil He's a real man Make a small opening to save time. Go! Yes, sir! Run Bomb Squad, give Wei a suit The Lieutenant is in charge. It's on you Guoqiang, this is your sniper operation Yes, sir As you say, your own safety is key The sniper needs to set up. Talk and buy more time On my orders. It's already loaded Don't be angry. I didn't want you to bear this alone If possible, let me talk a bit more If I can control the scene, don't let the sniper shoot You win You can still smile? These clothes are safe and warm But it weighs over 35kgs Does this count as a merit? I might get a reduced sentence for this? I can still care for my mom in this lifetime The roof-cutting team is in place Hurry Say something, Captain Zhong Are you being brave for your daughter? How is it your daughter's here? If she wasn't here, would you be going back in? What's wrong with her? When the hostages come out we'll go in Once we go in, will we get out alive? I promise to keep you alive as long as I live What if you die first? Just kidding. I'm a nervous wreck Once inside, stay next to me and don't move May I speak? Speak the truth, not nonsense What did you stuff into my clothes just now? That's nonsense Arms You should get a job at Airport Security Again, bullshit Go Police Police! Hurry, help! What's going on? Talk, don't hit. We're in positions of power These sons of bitches Where's my daughter? Dad, I'm here I'm fine. You take care Help! Police! I'm afraid of heights Your outfit is awesome. Can you get us out? What is all this? What's tied around our necks? Can you tell me what's going on? It looks like a bomb. Is it real? It's real We're missing one person Maybe there's a still a hostage inside Good job, Captain Zhong You really brought him in here I'm a man of my word. I want to evacuate the hostages Your crimes are not serious We can explain everything away I can prove you stopped voluntarily You can't help me. It's my time now 18 more minutes What's he wearing? What a ridiculous getup We must do our best to protect him This is my turf. You can't protect him You guaranteed his safety His temporary safety In this getup, I don't recognize him Remove his helmet Helmet off Stay back Stay back Don't play this game with me. They despise me I'm not afraid. He thinks I'll cause evil Stay back I don't want to wear this It's stuffy. I'm dizzy I'm not afraid. Wei Xiaofu Isn't that what's-his-name? How come it's him? Put on your helmet Relax, Captain Zhong. I'll be with you now The police forced you to come, right? You're wrong. I came willingly You've rounded everyone up. The truth will come out I've been waiting for this day Big brother, when will you be back? Everyone knows this girl, right? Now you know she's my baby sister We were separated. I found her five years ago She's the meaning of my life I came back, but didn't see her I finally found a way to meet with you I don't know what happened five years ago But you were all there. Let's talk It's been so long. What if I can't remember? The bomb is remote-controlled. It may help you think Let me think. I should remember Let's begin When we're done I can go back out, right? Someone won't make it out today Then what can I do to make sure I will? Don't mess with me, but that's hard for you Say your piece. Hurry Who should speak first? Cutting the roof takes time The team is worried about disturbing those below You're right. My first idea won't work Just play for time Let me start Wait, Zhong Remove your communication devices so I won't have to We're trying other ways to get in We can launch the assault in 15 minutes Till then, you're in charge of the inside Wei Xiaofu, you start It all started with me That night, almost at this time A few customers were at the drugstore. I went in I want to do something for my mom She's in poor health. But I can't afford tonics My mistake was being too nosy I'll give you 20 extra I wanted to ask whose wallet that was No way- who're you trying to kid? You were drunk, what do you know? I was drinking, but my mind was clear Hand it over What is this? I just picked it up from the floor You stole it I just picked it up Do you know who I am? You dare to steal my stuff? Go to hell I really did pick it up Wait. Don't move. And then? Then… Quickly I'm clearest on what happened next Go to hell! I really picked it up Wait. Don't move This is mine. Did you pick it up, too? Does he have any more? Two boxes I'm a man of principles. I convince with reason Were you being reasonable? I call it as I see it That's called hitting me when I'm down What? I remember every word you said that night This box costs tens of thousands You have good taste Shall we handle it ourselves or call the police? Handle it or call police You can't tell? He's poor Call the police Sure. I'll call them now Don't call the police I was afraid it'd turn into a big deal That's how it became a big deal Who dares to call the police? Don't! Stop, if you want to live What do you mean? What do you want? Give it to me Give it over. Now Hello, Police? Thinking back I really was confused I should have run. They wouldn't have stopped me But I — Give me the phone We're being robbed! The drug store by Gu Lou Give it to me! Let go! When my sister was thrown to the ground You just watched He was closest, and he ran. What could I have done? Of course I wanted to approach, but they left I'm not experienced with one-on-one I wasn't scared, but he dragged me away And then? I'll tell the story for you I was off-duty and passed by Comrade Police, something's happening there Don't move. Stay away He stole something. She called the police The thief, he — Step out Stop. Don't come over Call dispatch, notify local police I was thinking then — I'll tell it for you The criminals may kill the hostages Don't move! Back off Captain Zhong has the power to — One more step and I'll kill her - easily and decisively kill you You're being ridiculous If that were true, it wouldn't be a problem All life is precious. Without understanding — Captain Zhong is used to talking it out There's no rush. Let's talk it out But Zhong was distracted. His wife was run over by a car and being treated in hospital The hospital and his daughter kept calling him I get it Why are you on the phone? I'll be right there Hang up Wei Xiaofu gets out of control Are you tricking me? What do you want? Do you think I'm bluffing? And the rest is history LIVE Captain Zhong, tell us what's going on inside You tell great stories. How can you be sure? Were you there? How do you know everything? Are you done speaking? It's my turn Miao will tell you, but she doesn't know much That night, my wife was running a high fever I was working and couldn't take her to hospital She forbidden her to go She took a cab alone, and the accident happened I ignored my phone, but felt something was wrong I felt rushed that day Captain Zhong was so patient that day Take your time, we'll talk everything out When I called back I found out what happened By the time I rushed to the hospital it was too late I wanted to explain to my daughter, but she wouldn't listen or forgive me I tried to convince him to stop I took the drugs for my mom Let's clarify everything and do what must be done Let the girl go. It would be bad if she got hurt We'll think of a way to help your mother Will that do? So can't you let me go? Please! Wei was agitated. Your sister was quite calm I didn't know what to do. Suddenly — Accidents always happen suddenly Fine. Let me continue It was chaos outside. Your sister said, softly, "Kill me." What did she say? She spoke very softly. I thought I'd misheard What did you say? You heard it, too I heard her cry out, once That was her second cry What did you say? "Kill me" What are you doing? It wasn't me, I didn't move Ambulance She injured her carotid artery and bled to death This is the truth you wanted So, my sister killed herself Of course. I used my knife as a bluff I never guessed she'd grab it, it scared me Why should I believe you? I believe him You weren't even there She was troubled. See what drug she bought What drug? What drug did she buy? Manager, I'm afraid you must tell us What are you doing? Testing for leaks You're paying for this Sleeping pills Prescription? 100 pills By law, it's sold by prescription only I'm a man of principle And then? I'll take over from here The law is dead. People are alive A warning: to pull a bluff, just take a few Can I buy them or not? Sure, but it doesn't cost this much I'll give you a few more pills, then Coming! One moment, please Are you done? Yes Continue- What? They're all the same You broke up? It's always that I've taken them before. It's horrible I had my stomach pumped. Vomited like mad What else did you say? Nothing You're no angel. I remember what you said next What true love? I don't trust anyone any more There are so many men We're not the same kind of people What do you mean? Playing innocent You're so blind! Just go and die When did I say all that? You said it Wu, I never did. I tried to talk her out of it Your sister died because of what she said You sold her the drug knowing she was depressed I can prove he sold her the drug They're working together Shut up! Calm down. They did find sleeping pills on her Does buying sleeping pills equal suicide? Extreme agitation may cause dire actions I know why Watch what you say Half of female suicides are for a man The other half are for several men Boss Wu I say so because I've done it I realize now it's not worth it, but many don't Listen to me I completely understand how you feel It's hard to live alone abroad for so many years Your sister was your only family, the light of your life She died, so you came here to investigate or take it out on someone. That's natural Go on. You have five more minutes You planned this to punish her killer, right? Regardless of method, you have the wrong target You mean, you're all innocent What Lan said makes sense Explain yourself There's something you should know Your sister was pregnant at the time She sees you as a parent she must have told you Stop When the M.E. discovered her pregnancy, we investigated She had no marriage record, and the father never came See? Men are not worth it! No one here is who you're looking for Even if you find him, it could become a story You're trying to confuse me I want to clear your mind Even so, you're out of time Look, you've made it like a trial today Each one of you is guilty The law has already — You just watched as my sister died? You, a cop, I admit I made mistakes It was your knife. Does ten years in jail pay for her life? What do you want from me? Niu, Lan, you stood by while she died. You're killers What did I do? No one minds others' business any more At least let me know why I have to die I helped her. I tried to talk her out of it She didn't trust anyone. It's not my fault Manager Put on your helmet For a small profit, you let my sister die I'm not the only one. And she didn't die from the drugs No one shoots! Tell them to put down their guns Don't force me to shoot Stop, Wu. You can still live if you surrender now No shooting Fine. Stop shouting or I'll shoot you This is a great outfit Drop your guns. Behind you, Dad Life's like a cocktail- Gotta drink it to know if it was bitter or sweet You're hard to handle Meet Kun, bartender and bomb maker My leg What do you want? Don't worry. This is fake. The real ones come later - None of you can hide from them - Please! Spare us! Why didn't you just kill me? Glad you understand. I'm saving you But it's over Not yet You're my sister's boyfriend, right? What kind of joke is this? I found half a picture among her things I remember your tattoo You've changed it, but I still know it Really? Really? Since Zhong has said so, I'll tell you Yes, I am he Interesting. I thought you escaped long ago Yet you work and make bombs for me Why are you pointing your gun at me? I want to see how you avenge Mei's death Good for you. We're really all here I was a coward then But now I know I'll be last to go, I fear nothing Talk fast. You have two minutes to live Wu, you had a part in her death, too What? She told me you didn't want her to be with me But I genuinely fell in love with her She got pregnant and told you But you said you'd come to kill me. She was so hurt There was no hope for me, so I broke up with her That night, we had a big fight She stormed out, crying. I ran after her Even that last time we looked at each other we never knew how fragile life would be I lived for revenge. Now I know how much she hated me What one didn't treasure, one may not salvage Right, Wu? Come on, you've got the gun Wu I wronged her the most I most deserve to die Get down Miao! Dad, I'm here Dad I'm here You missed the first train I could have gotten on, but there's no point You destroyed my plan Your plan? Why must you harm my daughter? Everyone's lives are worthless except Mei's No one has the right to take others' lives in anger Stay away My sister didn't deserve to die So you have to hurt more people? If she were alive, would she want this? But she's dead. She's not coming back Then you should treasure life even more Dad Let my daughter go This is the same scene as five years ago Shoot. You get a merit. I get to die. Win-win Of course, there may be accidents I beg you, let my daughter go If I do, will it be over? You must pay for your actions Throw the gun over Don't obey. Don't let him have the gun Throw the gun over Wu Jiang You're right. Someone must pay I'll do anything for my sister Sadly, now I know I'll never escape One last game, Zhong. You and me. There's one bullet left. Shoot before the next train Shoot me and I'll stab her in the neck Shoot yourself and she lives Dad, don't believe him Shoot me and I'll stab her neck Shoot yourself and she lives Don't shoot, I'll kill her anyway Who lives? Who dies? It's up to you I was late then because I was saving someone else I was wrong to blame you Unfortunately, I failed there, too Zhong, the train's coming I'll take responsibility for your sister's death My daughter has nothing to do with this Please don't hurt her, no matter what I want to see you be that kind of father I'll give you ten seconds before I shoot No, Dad Child, I've been a bad father. I had no time for you, and made you feel vulnerable. Sorry But… for you I'll do anything One… Sorry. I removed the bullet just now I would do anything for my sister A small trick Zhong, I admire you. Go wait for me on the platform Dad, I can't go Go, get someone! This is an order! Now! Run Is there anything else, Zhong? I have to arrest you Say I disappeared. I'd do anything for my sister I'd die for her Wu Jiang! Get out of my way It's not worth it I'll take the blame Ignore me, as if I were a bug Don't worry about me Give up. You can still live Goodbye Down the well-lit street A cold spell suddenly attacks Distant warmth cannot Relieve nearby sorrows Am I just going with the flow? As long as the story continues I must remain on defense Loyal to my own battle Hurry, get a doctor! Hang in there You threw the switch? Yes. Perfect timing, right? What can I use for my rescue When love has drained away Who can keep whom Who will my heart wait for What can I use for my rescue Love is like a poison arrow Who can protect whom Who can make love last forever Wait Good one, brother That hurt All the hostages are safe, no penalty for you How's Wei Xiaofu? He's a tough kid Take care of your father Dad, you're great I'm very ordinary Stop being humble, cop Take it easy on me from now on Wu Jiang says, you win this round This is for you.
