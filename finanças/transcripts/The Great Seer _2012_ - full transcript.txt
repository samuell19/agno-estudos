It is my sincere desire. Find Ja Mi Won. Someone has found it. Who was it? He's called Dong Yoon. What exactly is Ja Mi Won? It's a legendary site. His Highness wants to be independent from China with its power. You! Are you spies from the Woodi Tribe? I'm a prophet who can read the ways of the earth. I'm a general from Goryeo, Lee In Im. He is a criminal in Goryeo. Hand him over to me. I will buy you some time. Go. What is your name sir? Lee Sung Gye. The Ja Mi Won is fake. The Ja Mi Won he gave to His Highness was fake. Save Dong Yoon and me. And who is the last person? I can't raise someone else's child as my own. He must die. Of course he must die. Episode 3 The door! Did you lock the door? Yes, My Lady. Give me the towel. Here. My Lady! We don't have much time. His philtrum is long. His forehead is broad. He has a mole behind his neck. And... my baby... Don't worry my baby. I will remember you! Even after 10 years or 100 years... I will remember you. My Lady! I was worried that something had happened. I was about to contact you. I think I'm going to start my contractions. Please wait outside. Get that servant girl! There is a baby inside the basket the servant girl took outside. Get her! Yes sir. That's Dong Yoon! Go after him! Yes sir! Follow him! Where is the baby? Didn't you promise that you would let him live? He is healthy. He will grow up somewhere safe. Do you mean he will be raised by his father? The father and the baby both live. Now keep your word. You promised that you would give me your heart. I didn't forget. You deserve to become my wife. My Lady! Your Excellency! The Head Priestess has requested that you dismiss everyone here. What are you doing? She gave birth to a healthy boy. Go back! Look! This is where your mother lives. You will meet her soon. Mother? What are you talking about? Your mother is royalty. She is a bold person. Did you hear that? The baby wants to see his mother. You think she will accept this child? No! No! She will never do that. She must become the mother of this child. You must make her the mother of this child. Oh no! He must be hungry! Quickly take him to his mother. Just wait for a minute. Your mother will feed you. Give the baby back to the Priestess. I am the Head Priestess of Goryeo. I will be the Head Priestess of Goryeo. I will die as the Head Priestess. But... Goryeo does not let a Head Priestess who has given birth live. You gave birth to a child without even worrying about that? How much do you think you know about me? Do you think I would die for this child? Or... Would I kill this child to keep my place? I saved your child once. You said that you would never forget it. Become the mother of this child. Or I will kill this child and remain Head Priestess. I will pay you back in a different way. What are you waiting for? Give the child back to her. Did you hear that? It was not I who let you die. It is because the princess would not accept you. The person who let you die is that woman. Don't let anyone raise this child. I will get a nanny for him. You should go back. Even the father of the child... I will not forgive him for holding this child. I didn't give birth to this child so that he could be raised by a nanny. You want your child to be raised as an illegitimate child? Just leave him and go back in. Your wife will raise this child. My Lady! Everyone has left the child. They are really going to kill him. The wind is cold. Close the door. He went in. Let's go back. Your mother... She is... She is talkative. She talks so much. She is the feistiest woman in all of Goryeo. It's not just that. She even scolded the general of the empire who was a beastly man. Back then... I thought I was going to die. I almost peed in my pants. But... But... Your mother... She has very small feet. Her feet are small. That small woman... is protecting both you and me. 10 Years later - Year 1362 11th year of King Kong Min's reign. Outskirts of Gaegyoung City. You won the battle by predicting where the enemy was going to camp. This time you will earn the glory of recovering Gaegyoung the fastest. You surely are great, sir. It's too early for praise. Our mission isn't finished yet. Who will dare stop you? Please give us the final order. Send in scouts to check Gaegyoung first. Yes sir. Go! Patrol the right side with 10 soldiers! Yes sir! You go to the South! Guard it! Yes sir! You go guard the North! Yes sir! We attack the East Gate. Mu Yong will lead us. Siege the gate! Yes sir! Godspeed everyone! Gaegyoung is right there! Yes sir! General! You should report immediately. What are you waiting for? It's... Report! The city... the city... What? Is it burning? No... Hey! Hustle! You! Whose soldiers are you? I'm the deputy general for General Lee Sung Gye, Woo Hyun Sook! Come in! General Lee Sung Gye has been waiting for you. Hey! What took you guys so long? Let's hurry up, shall we? Do we have to clean up the mess too? You pigs! Drink up! General! Come! Have a bowl of wine. Thank you! It was very easy for me to come in. Is that right? It was very hard for me. Those bandits. I don't know what they have been eating. We barely won. Here! Drink this! Then you must have suffered quite a few casualties. That's right. Casualties... We lost five people! To kill only 1000 Red Hood Bandits... We lost five of our soldiers. General! It was over 900, but not 1000. Is that right? 900! 900! Who cares if it was 900 or 1000? You truly have given meritorious service to your country with this battle. It was all luck. Luck is also part of your abilities. That's right! Luck is part of my abilities! You're so good. His Highness will reward you. It's not like we did this for credit. We did it for the love of our country. In any case, what will His Highness give me? I hope it's not just dinner. Prepare for the arrival of His Highness! House of Seo Woon: The government body that was in charge of observing astronomy and the ways of the earth. Leave. Stand up. The person who found Ja Mi Won first. He said that we should wait 50 years. He said that Ja Mi Won would only show its power then. He said that he found a stone written with script saying so. I'm afraid. I'm afraid that he is right. After all the trouble... I declared independence from China. But what good is that? I can't even fight against the Japanese pirates who are leeching off my people. That's not all. When the Red Hood Bandits attacked... I abandoned my people and my palace. I ran like a coward to save my life. I ran away. Because you saved yourself from trouble... The Goryeo Dynasty was saved. That's why we still have Goryeo people. What was his name? The person who first found Ja Mi Won. His name was Dong Yoon. Mok Dong Yoon. I see. After we declared independence from China... Goryeo has suffered from invasions and disunity. As the king... I am ashamed to look at my people. Even with my incompetence... you have still done your best for your people and country. I hereby bestow rewards. For rescuing the country from foreign invasion. The first person to recover Gaegyoung. We will give the yellow award, the fourth biggest award of all. Choi Young! And! Lee In Im! For his contribution to recovering Gaegyoung... For being the first person to recover the capital... He will be appointed the office of Chief Commissioner of Goryeo. Your grace humbles me, Your Highness. General Lee Sung Gye, who is in charge of ruling Dongbook-myun. He will be appointed as the Governor of Dongbook-myun. Your grace humbles me, Your Highness. Governor! General! Congratulations! Have a shot. Look at his face. Go give him a shot. I'm here to get a glass of wine from the First Class Contributor. Now that you're leaving to Dongbook-myun... I can't hide my sorrows. I will miss your laughter. You can always come and listen. I will laugh at you acting cute. No matter how I think about it... His Highness was very wise with his decision. To a general who is less familiar with Goryeon etiquette... the countryside is much better than the city. I know now why there is no one around you. Maybe it's because you come from the countryside... You stink! I can't get near you! I really do smell something. It's from you! The smell of your dead body decaying. As an officer of the army you have insulted your superior officer. You dare do so and expect to live? Give me a shot. I have made a mistake because I was ignorant. Put down that knife. Why did you stop me? I would have killed him with one slash. I think I will have to kill him. I'm not questioning him for insulting me. It's for order in the army. I will demonstrate that order in the army is very strict. Stop! Why are you crying like a girl? Didn't you see? The Lee Sung Gye I know! He is a proud general who recovered Gaegyoung first! But now that I look at you, you're just a crying girl. You think a general only fights in battles? The fight is even here! Patience and mercy are all part of the fight. Damn it. Did you bring what I asked for? Of course. One year later. Year 1363. 12th year of King Kong Min's reign. Give it! It's really perfume right? Of course it is! You have to pay first. Fine! How much is it? I don't get paid by friends. No need for that. Tonight. Fine! Give me the perfume first. - Tonight! - Okay! Let me see. Give it back to me. The smell. Brat! Give me that! Tonight! You put dog hair on cat poo didn't you? Shut up! Even cat poo can become perfume. Crap is crap. What? What did you call me for? Come outside of the gates at noon. - We got a job? - What job? I told you not to hang around him! Ouch! Ouch! You should go alone! Why call him out? I'm leaving! I told you not to get along with him! Do I have to tell your father? I think the key has feet. It always goes missing. Bring it to me. I will make one for you quickly. - Hello beautiful. - Hi. Ji Sang! You have the best hands! Ji Sang! Do you think we'll get any customers today? Customers? Not today. No customers. Why not? It's going to rain tonight. It's so sunny. Come on. When have I been wrong? Watch. It's going to rain tonight. Young Master! What are you doing over there? Just go back in! This is mint tea. Mint tea clears up the head and the eyes. They are great for students. I dried them for tea. This must be Three Hundred Grass. It's a precious root that only grows on Mount Jisan. Yes. I found them and dried them when I was staying at Mount Jisan. I heard that its tea is great for skin. It's good for constipation. That's why it's good for the skin. Let's drink it. Call Jung Geun. Jung Geun was peeking anyway. Mother! I was passing by. And I could smell the tea. Hae In went all over the country to find these roots. Taste them. What? You don't like it? I do. You never drink it when I make it for you. I guess it tastes good because Hae In brought it. Help with her studies, Jung Geun. Let her read the books you've learned. Yes Mother. This is the astronomy chart drawn by Oh Yoon Boo. Oh Yoon Boo? The astronomer of China famous for his complete charts? You're old enough to get married. Why study astronomy? I was going to ask my father to find a man for my marriage. What? But it's too early to get married! You just said that I should get married. What I meant was that... Just look at this. Hot Girls Stories? You learned these too? Who put this here? This Heung Wang Temple has low security. Please return to the palace. I like staying here. The Japanese pirates are attacking not only Haeju and Bongsan but also Hamheung. It won't end in thievery. But they will rape women. And even the children... I heard that they are committing unspeakable deeds. It is my incompetence to have worried you, Your Highness. You must kill me. If I didn't have you, it would have been a disaster. That's right. Let the Red Hood Bandits and the Japanese come! I will kill them all! First defend Dongbook-myun well, General. Your Highness! There are still Red Hood Bandits remaining in Gaegyoung. Isn't there something I could do in the city? No. The Red Hood Bandits brought poverty to this land. I can't neglect defending the borders. Give your best efforts in defending the borders. Yes, Your Majesty. But a man cannot just hide here. A man? Are you referring to His Highness? Watch your mouth! Defend Dongbook-myun? How can he say that? You still cry like a girl. What is more important to a warrior than protecting his country? Fine! Fine! I will go! I will go have a drink and go back to defending Dongbook-myun. This is the letter from the emperor to you. The emperor? If everything goes well today, you will become a servant of the empire. What? I, Yong, will do everything for the emperor. The heavens and earth know his fate. You don't need to worry. What about the Commissioner? I have to meet him. Tell me. When was the last time you held her in your arms? I don't remember. Think again. Even if I take her body, there is no joy without her heart. You've gotten better at lying. How long are you going to make Jung Geun study astronomy? He can't take any offices. Just leave him. His mother will take care of his education. Yes. Once you follow the orders of the emperor... Jung Geun will become a servant of the empire. Why would it matter? I will stay out of it this time. What do you mean? Killing the king. If it goes wrong, it's a treason large enough to kill all of my relatives. If you're going to do it, I won't stop you. But I can't go with you. Dae Ho won't be able to do it alone. I told the emperor's ambassador that you would work with us! That's your fault. You started it. You finish it. Here! Be careful! It was very hard to get it from China. This looks strange. What is it? Hide it! Why do you need to know? Just deliver it. I need to know what it is to deliver it well. Fool! This is a tool used to find good sites for houses. Okay? If you dig the ground, it's a grave. If you put blankets on it, it's a site for a house. Why pay for this? Shut up! Just deliver it. I just need to go in, right? Yes, go. Hey! Hey! You know how to do it right? If I lose it, I just pay double the price. If I get caught, I just say I did it all alone. It's not about money. If they find out that this is in Goryeo, the empire will not be happy. This is only for finding sites for houses. This is used to help find directions in battlefields. It leads to where the water is. It's a mysterious object! So be careful! Okay? Don't worry! We do this all the time! Act straight! I will. Do it right. Smile. Okay! Hurry up! He talks too much. What's all the fuss about? They are searching for contrabands from China... and runaway servants from Goryeo. They will just take the contraband items. And they will send the girls back. Are you sure that they won't just take the girls too? Do you know what would happen if they got caught? They are here to find their homes again. Exactly... Where are you coming from? I'm from Gyojudo. What brings you all the way here? My mother is from Gaegyoung. That's why I'm here. Are you sure you're not a runaway slave? What is this? It's bone ash. It's my mother. She wanted to be buried in her homeland. I brought her here. Hurry up and go. Where are you going? I've got nothing. I'm empty-handed! What's taking so long? He can be trusted. Don't worry sir. If you lose it, I will be very unhappy. Don't worry. He's here. Hey! Come! Hurry! Hey! Where is it? I don't have it right now. What are you doing? What happened? I put it in her luggage. Where did she go? Hey! Hey! Excuse me. That's not her? It's a girl in a pink dress. I think the luggage was smaller. It was smaller than that? Yes. I will kill you later. A girl wearing a pink dress carrying luggage. Hey! You're trying to steal it aren't you? Steal what? I'm not a thief. I don't want it anyway! Fine! If I'm a thief, are you a smuggler? What? What? Let's go. Let's see who gets a bigger punishment. He's right there. - Sir! - Hey! Do you even know who he is? Yes. It must be something precious. Shut up if you want it back. I just have to find the girl. What's wrong with them? I'm going to kill him. Commissioner! Wait. Yes sir. Commissioner! Why the hostility? I haven't changed my mind. If you have hidden assassins to shut my mouth... His swordsmanship is quite amazing. You have me wrong. Why shut you up? I don't mean to persuade you or to hurt you. I only wanted to tell you something. Princess Young Ji gave the king Ja Mi Won. I heard it's fake. Stay outside. How did you know? You're underestimating the empire. You think the empire would let Goryeo just take the real Ja Mi Won? If the princess lied to the king and gave him a fake Ja Mi Won... Do you think the King of Goryeo will let your wife live? Are you saying that you will report me if I don't go along with you? I just want to team up with you. What will you do? Will you kill the king and save your wife? Or are you going to save the king and kill your wife? It's Jung Geun's robes. Put them in Jung Geun's room. Yes, My Lady. You must be all grown up now. Over there! Excuse me! Hold on a minute. So when you were passing by... Give it to me! - What are you doing? - No, it's not that! Hold her. We're not bad people. Mother! Mother! Who are you people? We didn't do it on purpose. Don't touch it! You're a runaway servant aren't you? No! Then why do you speak Chinese? I knew she was up to something. - Let's go. - I'm not! I'm not! Mother! Mother! Where is it? It was right here. If you had lost this, I would have put you in jail too. Yes sir. If you need anything, always look for me. Good work kid. Come here. Hold on. Pick agile soldiers and ready them. We will go to Heung Wang Temple tomorrow night. - Hae In and Sun Bok are fighting! - I said stop! What are you doing? I will show you what real teamwork is. Wolves! Run! Your son helped a lowly girl. He is already involved. The king is dying! The king! Heung Wang Temple! Lee Sung Gye has contributed the most. After tonight, the king will be dead. Follow after Lee Sung Gye. He will see that rat again. The best place to hide when the enemy comes is inside girls' skirts!
