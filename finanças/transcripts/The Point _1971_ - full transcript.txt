I'll turn it off right after the program's over. - Program? You know, I can remember when kids liked to have stories read to them. They'd actually beg their parents, like their fathers, to read to these stories. - Oh Dad, you always start talking about that when I want to watch my program. - It was a very big deal. The fathers would read these exciting stories, and sometimes, adventure stories to them. - This is my favorite program, Dad. - And the kids, would brag to their friends about how their fathers would read these great... - Oh, Dad, the other guys get to watch their programs. - Kids used to like their parents, used to like them to read these marvelous... - Dad. - [Dad] Hmm, hmm. Hmm, now let's see, now here's a story. This is a story... - There'll be monsters? - This is a story a man could actually read to his... - Yeah, okay Dad. - Monsters? (tv clicks) Yeah, sure, monsters, listen. Once upon a time, a long way from here, and a long way from now, there was a tiny village where everything, the houses and the carts, the bridges, and the barns, everything, all had points on them. In fact, it was so full of points, that even the people had points. (people murmuring) The people, right there on top of their heads. (laughs) And it didn't seem strange at all because that's the way life was in the village. (triangles clanking) That's the way it always had been. And for all anybody knew, that's the way it always would be. As you might have already guessed, the main activity of the village was making points. And needless to say, business was brisk and the competition was competitive.

You could look high, and you could look low, but you'd never hear any complaints on that Count. (bird squawks) Well, almost never. ♪ That's the way it's going to stay ♪ And then, one day, a very unusual thing happened in the village. A little baby boy was born, a boy named Oblio. Now, don't get the wrong idea. The being born part wasn't usual. Little kids were being born all the time in that village. What was unusual was that Oblio, unlike any of the other babies born that day, or any other day, had no point. He had no point at all. - Hi, son. Hi, Oblio. (baby coos) - Well, hello there. - Hi, how ya doin'? - Fine, nice to see. - [Thin Man] Good, what's new? - Same ol' sixes and sevens. - [Thin Man] Really? Well, I have to... - I guess you heard about them? - Them? - Them, yeah, they had a kid. - That's nice. - Kid's got no point. - Oh, come on. - No, I'm serious. Their kid's a kid who's got no point. - You're putting me on. - Would I lie to you? - Well, I think that is wild. - [Father] So, you see, Oblio was a kind of, involuntary, instant celebrity. His uniqueness was, well, something that was noticed around the village. Naturally, his parents couldn't help noticing, either. - We have a lot to be thankful for, you know. - He's a healthy little nipper, I'll say that. - [Mom] And he's happy. - [Dad] (sighs) I'll be he'll be great... - [Mom] Oh, he has a wonderful disposition. - Yeah, but he doesn't have a point. - Maybe, maybe he'll grow one. (dad grumbles) (Oblio coos) - [Father] But, he didn't. No, as things turned out, Oblio didn't grow any point at all, but it really wasn't so very noticeable. As a matter of fact, in time, he took to wearing a cap, a pointed cap his mother made. It kept his head warm, and it did make him look a lot more like the other ordinary kids in the village. Just about the same time Oblio got his new cap, he also got - Arrow, Arrow. (dog barking) You guessed it, the greatest dog in the world. ♪ Where ever we go ♪ Everyone knows ♪ It's me and my Arrow ♪ Me and my Arrow ♪ Taking the high road ♪ Where ever we go ♪ Everyone knows ♪ It's me and my Arrow ♪ Me and my Arrow ♪ Do da do do da do do ♪ Straight as an Arrow And then, one day after school, a very serious thing happened. - Hey, let's choose up sides for triangle toss. - I got Harry. - Okay, then I want Fred. - Okay, Richard. - All right, then, I'll take Oblio. - Uh, uh, not him, he can't play, out. - [Father] It was the Count's son, and that was the serious thing. You see, the village Count was a very powerful man, and, frankly, not all that nice a guy, and the way things sometimes work out, a certain amount of that not niceness has rubbed off on his son. Oh, he was liked, but he was not well liked. - How come you said I couldn't play? - 'Cause you can't, so beat it. - Always have before, me and Arrow. - Hey, look, you're not playing, so just push on. - That's not fair. - Tough, triangle toss is for people with pointed heads. Toss the triangle... - We know how to play the game. - Then run and catch it on your point. - Oh, everybody knows that. - Yeah, but you got no point. So, you can't play. - We can play better than you can. - You what? - I said, we can play better than you can. - Hey, wait a minute. You're looking for some real trouble here. - And I'll bet you we can beat you at triangle toss, too. - Say that again. - I said, "I bet we can beat you at"... - Oh, yeah? Well, what do you wanna bet? - Huh? - Come on no point, what do you wanna bet? - Bet ya anything. - Oblio and the Count's kid are gonna duel.

The first man to catch two triangles wins. Get the idea, Oblio? (kids cheering) So, long sucker. - That's okay, Arrow, it's okay, heck, he's not all that tough. - Players, to your marks.

Arrow was the... - I won't forget Arrow, and I won't forget you either, round head. - Now, why would you want to go say something like that for? Remember, you were the guy who... - Oh, I'll remember, Oblio, and so will you. My father will see to that. (crowd murmuring) - Hey, come on, it's just a dumb ol' game. - A game, Oblio? Huh, when my dad gets done with you, you'll wish this dumb ol' game had never been invented. - If it's that important to you, then... - Do you gather my meaning, Oblio? (ominous music) - [Father] Predictably enough, when the Count learned of his son's defeat, he was furious. As for the boy himself, as soon as he saw which way the wind was blowing, he just laid low and let his father's evil disposition lead the way. - Would that it were not true. You idiot, you pathetic fool. I groomed you, oh how I groomed you. I cultivated you like a rare flower, and for this? Oh, no, by guile and foul deed I laid the ground work for you to rule this miserable village one day, and rule you will. I shall not be denied, but as long as that vile, little round person, that Oblio languishes among us, your leadership credibility is shot. We must rid ourselves of that contemptible little twerp, once and for all, and that's exactly what I intend to do. Yes, you'll still rule one day, you useless nit because Oblio is finished. You can bank on that. (ominous music) (upbeat music) - [Father] Now, the King, was a good-natured, harmless, old fellow, the kind who had weathered life in a rather middle groove, no great highs, no deep lows. He was a decent, but very ordinary, man. He was also a very ordinary ruler of other men. - Ah, if it isn't the illustrious... - My King, a word in your ear. - Oh, anything you say, my dear Count. I was just relaxing with a couple of... - Yes, I saw, King we have a problem. - Oh? Well, that's hard to believe. I thought all systems were go. I mean, I always like to think that... - King, the law of the land has been violated. - Violated, the law of the land? Oh, why, why that's impossible... - It is done. - Oh, but there must be some mistake, Why, the law of the land clearly states that everything and everyone must have a point. (laughs) That purely and simply is the law of the land. Why, you can't violate a law like that in a place like this, just look around. - You look around, my dear King. The law is being violated, at this very moment. For the sake of all the decent people, appropriate measures must be taken. - Measures, measures? Oh my, oh my, measures on a grave charge like this would require my convening, my convening the tribunal. - Exactly. - Oh, oh my. Now, now why do you want to go and create a problem like that? - Oh, that's no problem, King. That's a solution. The problem was created when the law was violated. In point of fact, by that little round-headed twit, Oblio. - Oblio? Oblio? But, I know him, why, he's a nice little boy. I know his parents. Why, it was my understanding that this Oblio was developing into a pretty decent little triangle toss player. - Hmm, so I gather. He's also round, which, as you yourself know, is in direct violation of the law. You may as well face it, my dear King, this Oblio is, literally, an outlaw. - Oh, but that's incredible. Wait a minute, he wears a nicely pointed hat. That should Count for something, shouldn't it? - No way, my King, we must convene a tribunal, a public tribunal, and so we shall, and then, after all the niceties are looked after, this Oblio will be neatly banished, forever. - A tribunal? Oh, no, and for Oblio? Why, isn't there any other way? - The law is the law, King. You cannot fight that. - The law is the law, hmm, well, I never looked at it quite like that. Very well, a tribunal it is, but I warn you Count, I won't have the boy railroaded. - Railroaded? - A turn of phrase, Count. (quirky music) - [Father] While the Count was having a marvelous time, no matter how rotten he may have been ethically and spiritually and every other way, as a prosecutor, he was good, and as a stand-up performer, he was even better. The way it all worked out, poor little Oblio never had a chance. - And so, noble King, and good gentlemen of the tribunal, I would only remind you that this law, so cherished a part of our tradition, was not enacted, nor is it being applied, for purposes of base persecution, or cruel harassment, oh good gracious no, the law was created to preserve and protect the sanctity, the integrity, the purity of our here, to for, unsullied life mode, and so it is, that this, this freak, this viper, Oblio, by his very existence here in our realm, only serves to... - Oh, my dear, isn't the Count absolutely too much? - Well, I'm sure he's very good, but all the same, I can't help feelings sorry for little Oblio. After all, he is... - Oh, I just don't see how you could say that. That's so, so sentimental. Well, sure, he's little, but the law is still the law, and where would we be, my dear, if... - But, to just sit here while those old men complacently let the little... - Listen, neither one of us was born yesterday, and we both know if we let one of Oblio's kind stay, oh, before long, the whole village will be crawling with... - Psst, psst, my dear Count, isn't there some way or other little Oblio could just, sort of, stick around? I mean, if he promised to keep his hat on all the time and didn't ever... - In this stead my King, the law is most explicit. We all agree that there has been a violation of law. The violator is right here in our midst. We can see that. That is, as the fellow says, beyond question. - Would it help if I promised to never ever play triangle toss again? I mean, if that's what you're mad about Count, I could... - No, gentlemen, the only question remaining is one of penalty. Here, again, the law is crystal clear. For such a grave breach, banishment, that is the order of the day. - Yeah the Count's really pulling the chain on that weird little Oblio. - Oh, how can you joke about such a thing? I think a terrible thing's happening, and Oblio's such a lovely little boy. - Yeah. - [Lady] You know, he's polite, and he's well mannered... - Well, he may be, - but would you want your daughter to marry... - Oh, you're baiting me. You're deliberately baiting me. I will not be subject... - Gentlemen, it remains beyond question that Oblio, by his mere rounded existence, stands in violation of the law. Here, our duty is clear, but we would ill be serving the law to overlook an entirely new facet of the case. In point of fact, Oblio was both aided and abetted by his flea-bitten canine. - Hey, please, don't do anything to Arrow. - Gentlemen, I charge this dog, Arrow, with criminal conspiracy. - Honest, Arrow's innocent. I did it by myself. I did it, Arrow wasn't even... - He is as guilty as Oblio himself, but what's more repellent about him, he's a disgrace to everything pointed. No, gentlemen, this Arrow is not only a conspirator, he is also a traitor, and he, too, must be banished. - [Big Man] Hey. - How's it going? - Not bad. - So, what's the latest? - Well, you know. - Wild trial, huh? - Well, if you've seen one... - What about this conspiracy business with Sparrow? - Arrow. - Right. - It could be a toughy. - No, you really think so? - Conspiracy's no laughing matter. - Hard way to go, is it? - Could be for someone like Arrow. - You know, he doesn't look like the conspiratorial type, though. - He's got a record long as his tail. - [Thin Man] That long, huh? - Yeah, Chasing, night barking, they'll throw the book at 'em. - Adios, Arrow. - [Big Man] That's it. - And so, it is my deeply unpleasant task to declare that this tribunal finds the boy, Oblio, guilty of living within our midst without a point. For this grave violation of law, he is, from this day forward, banished to the Pointless Forest. I might just parenthetically add, as our good Count so aptly put it, the law is the law, and as all of you know, without the law, why, why there would be no lawyers and without lawyers there... Well, it just goes on and on. - Deal with the dog, my lord. - Oh, yes, the dog. Well, Arrow, I must send you over, too, boy, involuntary conspiracy. - Take them away. (ominous music) - Now dear, I know how you hate to wear undershirts, but we don't know what the weather will be like, and this is a dangerous time of year for colds, so... - Sure, Mom, great, I'll wear 'em. So will Arrow. Don't cry, Mom. - Well, I just don't want you to take a chill, little Oblio. - It's just about time, dear. You all set Ob? (solemn music) Well, son, I hope you realize, I mean, I hope you understand how distressing this is for your mother and me. I just wish there was some way, don't get me wrong, I believe in obeying the law and everything. Anything else would be anarchy but, still, I wish there was some way this particular law could be... - [Oblio] Sure, Dad, I understand. - Well, I just wanted you to know this, Oblio. - Good luck, Oblio. Good luck, Arrow. - And, don't blame the King too much, son. He just did what he had to do. Well, after all, it's his job. Frankly, I wish there never was such a law in the first place. Now that it's been used, it seems, well, it really seems unfair. - How come nobody did anything about it before, Dad? - Oh, it just never came up before, son. - Oblio, here Oblio. Here's a candy bar for you, for the road. - Gee, thanks Mr. Candy Man. - And, this, this is for Arrow. - [Woman] Hang in there, Oblio. - [Man] Stay lose, Ob. - Be seeing you, Oblio. - Oblio, ol' man, here's a little something for you, just in case you need some change. You know, you can never tell when you might need a couple of bucks to... (clears throat) Well, anyway, you know. - Thanks, Dad. - (sniffles) Take good care of yourself, dear little Oblio, and eat well, and write to us when you can. I mean, it doesn't have to be anything long, just a card to say you're fine. Would you do that, for your poor mommy, Oblio? (sniffling) - Sure, Mom, don't worry. We'll be okay, right Arrow? Come on, boy, let's go. - [Man] Go get 'em, Oblio. - [Father] Stay in there, pile driver. - [Man] Go straight Ob, you've got it wired! - [Man] Good luck, kid. - Goodbye, Oblio. Goodbye, son. - Goodbye, my little baby. (sniffling) - Goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. Come on, Arrow, let's go.

You've got a creative little head on your shoulders there, son. - Huh? - [Dad] I bet you can just picture this little Oblio and his dog right now. ♪ Me and my Arrow On and on they went. After a while, they even stopped looking back. The village having long since faded in the distance, and the truth of the matter is they were really a lot more excited about what lay ahead of them than what they had left behind, and who wouldn't be? No one had ever been to the Pointless Forest. Yet, now, Oblio and Arrow were going. - Hey, Arrow, you think they'll be monsters? (Arrow barks) I'd be just as happy if there weren't any monsters. But, either way, no matter what happens, we've got to stick close together because we're really a team now. Hey, you know what I hope? I hope, oops. Arrow! (dramatic music) Could this be the Pointless Forest? How can it be? It's got to be. But, if it is, how come everything's got a point? The leaves are pointed. The branches and twigs are too. Everything. (Arrow barking) Well, this is it, Arrow. This is the beginning of the place we were banished to. (Arrow barks) There's just one thing I don't understand. How are we suppose to get through this stuff to get in there. It's so thick, it's like a jungle. (Arrow barks) Good boy, Arrow, good boy. Now, just follow me. No, I'll follow you. No, we'll go together. That's the plan, we'll go together. And whatever you do, don't leave me, Arrow. (upbeat music) - [Father] Oblio and Arrow and just barely set out onto the road into the Pointless Forest when all of a sudden, (rattling) (laughing) - Arrow, look, a man. A pointed man. (Arrow barks) Excuse me, sir. We thought this was the Pointless Forest. (laughs) Quite right my boy, well noted, this is the place indeed. By name, the Pointless Forest. (laughs) - But what is a pointed man doing in the Pointless Forest? - Listen to the lad, me pointed? That's too funny. You know, he's funny. Me, a pointed man? This news amuses me. - But, sir, you're pointing right now, more than any... - My boy, I'm not the pointed man you think I am. I can point in every direction, sure, any fool can do the same, but a point in every direction, is the same as no point at all. Would you argue the point, I wouldn't, not on a bet, it never entered my mind. (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Father] Suddenly, Oblio and Arrow were all alone in the Pointless Forest. At first, everything seemed quite peaceful. Oblio thought about the pointed man and wondered what his friends in the village would have said, if only they knew he had seen and talked to such a rare person. Then, Oblio noticed how quiet it was. Arrow noticed, too. It was very quiet. Then, little by little, Oblio began to feel lonely. - You know Arrow, I was just thinking. I mean, about that pointed man. I don't know. I think there's something a little funny about that man. I mean, he's pointed, heck, he's always pointing. Then he says he isn't a... Arrow, hey Arrow, I think I'm scared. (Arrow growls) Hey, now what do you want to go and growl like that for? Especially, when I told you I... (Arrow growls) What is it, boy, huh? (Arrow whines) (ominous music) Wow, giant bees, run, Arrow, run for your life. (bees thudding against trunk) Arrow, what'll we do? (bees thudding against trunk) Wow. (Oblio yelling) Ow, Arrow, help! (trunk crashes) (groaning) What was that? - [Man] I believe it was e flat, double style, extra fortissimo, don't you know it? - Huh? (laughing) - Say, what's happening with you, boy? You been goofing with the bees? - Gosh, who are you? - It's me, the Rock Man. - I never saw a rock man before. - Well, us stone folks are everywhere, just open your eyes and look around you. - You mean there are more of you? - Naturally, baby. There's a whole family of us rock folk. - Well, I was wondering if this is still the Pointless Forest. - It isn't, Jack, they ain't nothin' pointless about this gig, just look around yourself, the birds singing sweet loves song to the trees, squirrels doing crazy digs all over the place. Mother Nature, she watchin' over the whole scene, and dig me, taking it all in. - Yeah, but... - It's the here and now that I'm talkin' about, the smell of sweet life in the air. It's the warm feel of the sun and the beat of music, just digging yourself. - But, I can't see the... - Well, you see what you want to see. Tell me, did you ever see a dinosaur? - [Oblio] No. - Well, did you ever see a pterodactyl? - [Oblio] No. - Well, did you ever want to see a pterodactyl? - I guess not. - Well, that's it, you see what you want to see, and you hear what you want to hear. - Gosh, Mr. Stone Man... - It's Rock Man, Jim. You gotta keep yourself in historical prospective. - I mean Mr. Rock Man, well, you see, you're surrounding everything. - (laughs) Come on, boy. Out with it, don't get yourself all racked up and jammed, you got a question? Lay it on me, but let it out easy. - It's just that everything's been happening so fast. We were banished and then those bees. - I can dig it, I can dig it, yes. Look, let me hip you to reality. - I'd really rather know if this is still the Pointless Forest. - (laughs) Now, there you go again, pointless, that's the central issue of what I'm putting down for you cats. - Huh? - You gotta open your mind as well as your eyes, but first, you gotta get it together, you know, be cool, dig yourself. Get the message? Now, here's the lick. You don't have to have a point to have a point, dig? Now, I fear you've been getting some negative vibration from some place. You gotta collect yourself, be cool, be steady as a rock. (laughs) - Steady as a rock? - That's right, being a rock is a very heavy life. Us rock folk are impervious to heat. We stay cool, we're insusceptible to water, and that's cool, too. - But, when it rains, isn't it true that even stones... - Now there you go again. You're tensing up. Rain, oh yeah, sure, maybe rain turn a tree into a water log. Sometimes rain make a river lose its flood control, but a rock in the rain is just cool, very cool. - Boy, I never realized that rocks and stones were so... - All you gotta do is open your mind along with your eyes. Now, you gotta long road, son, so you remember what I say, okay? - [Oblio] Oh, I will Mr. Rock Man, I will. - Play it easy, and remember as you make it through this forest, ain't necessary to posses a point, to have yourself a point. - I'll remember that. - Yeah, well I think I'm gonna take myself a short nod, you roll by this way again, just fall in, I'm only a stone's throw... (snoring) (upbeat music) - It was awfully nice of Rock Man to explain that to us, and I'll tell you something else, I'll bet it's not everybody who gets to talk to rock folks. You know, he really was a... - (laughing) Ah, my good lad, been rolling right along I see. (laughs) - Arrow, it's the pointed man again. Hello, sir. - What's this, still talking of points, my boy? Seems he's obsessed. I'll make a point of noting that. - Your point, my son, love game! - We've just met a man who's made of stone. - Ah yes, excellent fellow, splendid chap, all you got a do is relax. You gotta open your mind, that's cool, (laughs). - He's a nice man. He knows a lot, and he's generous and... - He gave you gifts, a little remembrance, perhaps a small memento? - No, he told me things. He's interesting to talk to. - Ah, completely pointless, my boy. In word, abstract. To put it bluntly, sonny bob, pointless all pointless. As they say, no point, a big zero, as they say. (laughing) - Hey wait for us, wait. (Arrow barking) - [Father] Sometimes, you never know how really happy you are to see a person, until after he's gone. That's pretty much the way Oblio felt when he realized the man who was always pointing had just up and disappeared. (ominous music) - Jimminy, Arrow, that was a close call. You gotta watch your step.

(laughing) What a pleasure, what a splendid surprise, thought you might be holed up somewhere. - We were trying to catch up with you, and then we found this gigantic hole. It was big and dark, and scary. - And frankly, quite pointless. - No, we learned a lot. I know Arrow did, and so did I. Old Arrow found out he's really gotta... - Careful sonny, don't get in over your head. It wouldn't do to bury yourself intellectually, Point of fact, it never pays to submerge too deeply. (Arrow howling) - What is it, Arrow? (Arrow howling) - He must hear something. - Well, of course he hears something, obvious. - Come on boy, what's wrong, huh? What is it, Arrow?

(dramatic music) (Arrow barking) Arrow, come back Arrow, wait for me. (upbeat music) (Arrow barking) Arrow. (Arrow barking) Hey, hey Arrow. Hey, wait a minute, boy. Arrow. (singing in the distance) Arrow, why did you have to go and... (Arrow barks) (singing in the distance) Hey, Arrow, that sounds like singing. That is singing.

Sorry if he frightened you. He didn't mean anything by it, really. We were just watching you dance. It looked great. (laughing) Excuse me, but who are you ladies? (laughing) (upbeat music) (Oblio yells) Hey, ladies, wait, wait a minute. (playful rhythmic music) I really don't understand this. (playful rhythmic music) ♪ La la la la la la ♪ La la la la la la la ♪ La la la la la la la la ♪ La la la la la la la la ♪ La la la la la la la la - Thankless, wouldn't you say? - Hmm? Oh, you. I'm sorry, I didn't... - How's that? Out with it boy, get it off your chest. - The ladies, those three fat ladies, they way they danced and played and... - (laughs) Ah yes, quite pointless, ah, wouldn't you say, fat, round, pointless, get it? - Oh no, they do have a point. It's laughter and merriment and making each other happy. - Oh, really? That's an interesting misconception, but then, I'm sure you'll agree. (laughing) (upbeat music) (Oblio humming) - Hey, you, are you kidding? For crying out loud, will you get out of there? Not there, either. For the love of Morris, what are you trying to do? You trying to destroy me? Will you back off? What is this? Will you stop fooling with that mutt and get away from those leaves, you pathetic nincompeep. - I'm terribly sorry, sir. I didn't see you, and I didn't realize... - All right, all right, all right all ready. As it happens, those are Sunday in the sunset leaves, a golden veneer and very rare, and you looked like you were just going to plow right... - Gosh, I'm sorry, I never... - You know, leaves like that don't just grow on trees or something. - I really am sorry. We thought we were just in the regular Pointless Forest. This is still the Pointless Forest, isn't it? - Pointless? Pointless? Just look at those leaves, each one more pointed than the last. I tell you, this is the most pointed collection of... - Then, you're a collector. Golly, a leaf collector. - A collector? What, are you joking or something? Who ever heard of a grown man going around collecting leaves? Oh, that's weird. What am I suppose to do, put them in a scrapbook? - Well, I just thought... - [Tree] No, you didn't think. We're in business here, business. This isn't some game we're playing young man. This is the real thing, and we gotta move. - Jimminy, the leaf business. I didn't know people sold leaves. Well, I always thought... - You thought, you thought, (laughs) yeah, and while you're thinking I'm losing time, besides, I will do all the thinking around here. - [Oblio] Gosh, sir, I... - Listen, I can't talk now, young man. It's go for broke time from here on in. This is the time of year we put together a whole fall line. - I'm afraid I don't know what a fall line is. - It's the magic of the sorcerer and the excitement of the artist at the moment of creation. It's when we turn green leaves into greenbacks, when the gold on those trees becomes gold in our pockets. - You mean you're gathering all these leaves for... - Gathering? Gathering? (laughs) I'm not a gatherer, sonny. I'm manufacturer, and when you're in the manufacturing game, timing is everything. You make it or break it on timing. Sure, design counts, quality counts, maximizing total production potential, that counts. They all count, but without good ol' timing it's so long Charlie. - But, with leaves, how do you know if... - Take the fall season, if I brought it out in July, it's forget it, it's a distaster. Timing, it's all timing. (laughs) All right, let me ask you something. - Anything you want. - Ah, you're interested, I like that, and you're sharp I need people who are sharp. Sure, I can get help, but good help, that's something else, again. Question, is the world ready for a tweed leaf? Stop and think. - To tell you the truth, I just don't know. - I like that, you're honest. Yes, timing and honesty, that's the name of the game. All right, let's face it, this is a business just like any other business. Anyone can learn a business, right? But, honesty, uh, uh, uh, you either got it (laughs) or you ain't got it. Where you from, what's bothering you? - Excuse me sir, but don't leaves just make themselves? Naturally, without any... - Oh, my boy, you got a lot to learn. Tell me, what nationality are you? - Well, sir, I'm from the Pointed Village. - That's funny, you don't look pointed. - As it works out, I'm not, but my parents are. - It's all right, don't give it a second thought, my boy. I don't care what a man's faith, creed or color is. The only thing that matters to me is whether or not he can produce. Well, what do ya say? - About what? - Are you in or not? I'm offering you a chance to get into the leaf game. - But, what could I do? - Naturally, you'll have to start on the forest floor and work your way up, and I'll tell you one thing, I don't want to ever see you or that clown of a dog of yours standing around on the product. - Oh, we wouldn't, you can be sure of that. - Great opportunity for you, my boy. It can open doors for you, big doors. Seasonal, yes we're seasonal, summer, winter, spring, fall. You and your dog will work like dogs. Rest? (laughs) You'll rest during the fifth season, and their isn't any fifth season, but there are rewards. It's exciting, challenging work, manufacturing leaves. - But that's just it, sir. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I don't see how Arrow and I could... - It's the simplest thing in the world, my boy. You just plant your roots, right here with me, and by next season, you'll... - But, we don't have any roots to plant, we aren't... - No roots? No roots? Oh, well that just about tears it, doesn't it? Oh, it's too bad, too. You could've been up there with the best of 'em, kid. Sunday in the sunset, leaf of gold, you name it, you could have had everything, and together, we would have been unstoppable. We could have given 'em those tweed leaves, oh, it could have been beautiful, beautiful. - Boy, it sure sounds like it could've been. But, something's kind of confusing me. - Well, you just name it, son. You can't get answers in this world, if you don't ask questions. - It's just that I know there's a point to every leaf, but what's the point to all the leaves, your leaves? - That confuses you, doesn't it? Well, all of mankind is confused. You work, you struggle, you fight to survive. Little by little, you make something, you get ahead, and then one day you look, you see you got something, and I mean really something. - But, what's the... - Can't talk now, young man, gotta time problem that won't quit. Yes, timing. (laughs) Timing, that's the name of the game. (leaves rustling) (upbeat music) - No Arrow, let's go around. Who knows, these could belong to the Leaf Man, too, and you know how he is about stepping on his product. - (laughs) That's quite right my boy, watch your step, what ever you do don't bring a leave to grief. It's branch might blanch, worse yet, it's trunk might go kerplunk. - Oh, Mr. Pointed Man, you should have been with us. We met a very important business man. - Was he out raking leaves, perhaps? This brilliant industrialist, this extraordinary tycoon, ho, ho, ho, he, he, he. My good lad, your manufacturer is a bust. His product is so un-unique, it has to be completely pointless. - Oh no, he's a very industrious industrialist, and he never rests, and he always... - My boy, he's spinning his wheels. To put it concisely, his work is futile. In a manner of speaking, it's pointless. - That can't be, he told me that... - Sunday in the sunset, today tweed, tomorrow herringbone. The man's a lunatic. He's mad, clearly a case of dementia. - But he was nice, he offered me a chance to... - He's a King among me. He's a prince of a fellow. I pass, pair of jacks, ace high, in sum, my good lad, pointless, pointless. - I don't see how you can keep saying that about everybody. I mean, just because you don't... - Careful, boy, don't jump to any rash conclusions. You could land on thin ice, and come up all wet if you follow the image I've drawn. That could be a chilling experience. (laughing) - [Father] Little by little, Oblio was learning a good deal about the Pointless Forest and it's unusual residents, but unfortunately for him, and Arrow too, his knowledge couldn't possibly help him anticipate what was hovering directly above. No, Oblio had absolutely no way of knowing what was in the wind. (wings flapping) (ominous music) - Huh? Hey. Hey. (ominous music) Gee, Arrow, I always thought of a forest as a bunch of tree trunks, but it's a lot more. It's treetops, and horizons, and hills and meadows and everything. Man, this is great. - You know something, this bird could mean real trouble now. - Aw, Dad, they'll be okay. - Ah, sure, that's easy for you to say. - [Boy] What can an old bird do? - Well, you're not up there, hanging on for dear life. - Aw, come on Dad. You know he's not going to let him drop. - Well, I don't know that. I don't know that, and you don't either. You don't know how dependable he is. Why, he could very easily... - Nah, Dad, not a bird that size. - A bird what size? - [Boy] Well, didn't you mention something about a huge bird? I thought you said... - You know, when I was a kid, my dad read to me, and I listened, and I listened closely. I didn't go around interpreting things. - Yeah, okay Dad. - [Dad] I didn't jump to conclusions. - That's good, Dad. - I don't know what's happened to kids now days. You give 'em everything. You offer to read to 'em. I don't know, I just don't know.

We made it safe and sound. (Arrow barks) - [Father] As Oblio circled the mammoth egg, he was overcome with a strange sensation. He looked at the egg, very closely, examining it again and again, but each time, his conclusions were exactly the same. - Hey, this is weird. Just when I was sort of starting to think that this Pointless Forest isn't pointless at all, we come across something that really is pointless, at least it sure looks like it is. - [Father] You see, after each one of his adventures in the forest, Oblio always found himself left with a sort of free-floating feeling, that there was some sort of point to what he had experienced. Even though it had happened in a Pointless Forest. (cracking) - [Oblio] A point. Arrow, I was right in the first place. Even a thing like this, a thing that looks like it's all round has some sort of point. (cracking) (bird chirps) Hi, little fella. I mean, big fella. Are you all right? (bird squawks) Oh, well, I'm Oblio, and this guy right here's my dog. His name's Arrow. (bird squawks) What, are you saying what? Well, what happened is you just got hatched. You're born now, but don't worry, it happens to everybody, you'll be okay. (bird squawks) Where, is he saying where, Arrow? That's a little harder. You see, the name of this place is the Pointless Forest. That's where we are, all right, but I'll tell you something, I'm starting to think that instead of being pointless, this forest is full of points. Take you for instance, sure, you've got a pointed beak, but that's just a point, any one can see that. Your real point, well, that's something else again. (bird squawks) Why? That's the hardest one to answer. That's what I always want to know, why. And that's the question everyone always asks. (ominous music) (Large bird squawking) - Splendid idea, my boy. I'd like mine over easy, with a side-order of bacon, if you please, very crisp and coffee, the old mocca java! I had a hunch you'd be serving brunch. (laughs) And perhaps an apricot danish. - Oh, Mr. Pointed Man, I'm glad you're here, but how come that nice new bird's mother took him away like that? We were just talking about the why of everything, why this, why that, and just when I was thinking that... - Now, there you go again, you're thinking, that's very destructive, my lad, most destructive indeed. If a person does enough thinking, a certain amount of knowledge is sure to follow. The results, sonny bob, could be a life of misery. - But, I can't help it, I haven't been trying to think. Things just sort of start popping up in my mind. They occur to me out of... - Thoughts just start popping up into your mind, ideas formed without any effort on your part? You find that concepts simply conceptualize? - Well, yes. - That's grim. - It started way back when I met the rock man. - [Pointed Man] It's a disaster. - [Oblio] And it just kept on happening. - Mayday, it's a complete mayday. - I was hoping maybe you could help me figure out just exactly... - There's really nothing more that I can do. You're out of my hands, I tried to help you boy. I can show you the pointlessness of it all, but you wouldn't listen. - Sir, I hope you don't think I'm ungrateful. - You had to go digging around, didn't ya? You had to let thoughts slip into your head. You're lost lad, lost. The kid blew it, had everything going for him, and he blew it. The fact is, my boy, that it's under the circumstances, there's no place in the Pointless Forest for you. - But, where will I go, what will I do? I can't go home again, the Count had me banished. - Ta ta, jolly bye, ciao bucky, ciao. - Golly, gone again. I wonder where he goes when he does that. - Vanishing Point, ol' man, correct, the Vanishing Point, just another one of the facilities. Well, adieu, fare thee well, you take care of yourself, ya hear? - [Oblio] So long, sir. - [Father] Oblio watched as the Pointed Man disappeared, but unlike all the other times, he was not especially overwhelmed by what he saw. - I think he's really gone this time, Arrow. Arrow? Arrow? Here, boy. Arrow? (Arrow barking) I hear you boy, but where are you? He's gone. (Arrow barking) Stay where you are, Arrow. Don't move, I'll find ya. I know I will. Good boy, Arrow. Come on boy, you're all right now. Come on, Arrow. - [Father] It had been a full day for the two travelers, a very full day. For Oblio, it had been one adventure after another, of course, it had been pretty adventurous for Arrow, too. (Arrow barks) - That Vanishing Point, hmm, it only made it so I couldn't see. It didn't make it so you weren't really there. I'm starting to think that the Pointed Man, nice as he was, was realy about the only pointless person we've met in this whole Pointless Forest. (Arrow barks) Sure, he did an awful lot of talking, and it all sounded very fine, almost like the Count in a way, and after all, what's such a big deal about having a point on your head? Nothing against you, Arrow, you're great. But, I sort of think what's in your head is a lot more important. (yawns) It sure gets dark fast, doesn't it?

He's young, but he's sharp. - Oh, we should have never let them send him away. - Yeah, well, go tell the Count that, I mean, it was the law, dear. - Oh, it's a bad law. - Well, good law, bad law, what difference does it make? It's the law. - It makes all the difference. A good law never would have sent my Oblio away, never. - [Dad] Dear, the law is the law. - Well, you should have challenged it. - [Dad] What, I should have challenged it? - We all should have. - Law, I mean, but, but the Count came right out and said... - Oh, the Count, the Count. What about my Oblio? - Well, look, I mean, I'm just one man, I... - We should have all stood up. Even the King seemed like he was against... - Well, maybe you're right, maybe you're right. Maybe we should have tried. - He's so young. - What, the King? - My little Oblio. - Oblio, Oblio, it's Oblio. Hey, it's Oblio (yelling gibberish) (jubilant music) - [Man] Welcome home Oblio. - [Woman] We're glad you're back, Oblio. - You tell 'em Ob, break it down for 'em. - Come by the shop, Oblio. I have some butter balls for you, round, competely round. - Hello, Oblio. - There he is, there's Oblio. - My baby, my Oblio. - Well, hi son. Hi, Oblio. - On to the palace. - [All] To the King. - Your majesty, your majesty, there's a mob at the palace gate. - Mob? Well, that's pretty hard to believe. - Well, it's true, you know what a mob is. Shall I call out the palace guard? - Well, that does seem a bit excessive, doesn't it? - Well, what do you suggest? Send out a pastry tray, and let them eat cake? - Well, that's never worked before. Tell me, what does your intelligence agency make of it? - Nothing yet, nothing. They're still trying to infiltrate the crowd, but I'll tell you one thing, according to my son, it's all for that kid, that twerpy, round-headed Oblio. - Oblio? You mean little Oblio, who we... - Yes, my son claims he's come back. - Really? Oblio, little Oblio is back? - This is gravely serious, my dear King. - Yes, it is. You know something, Count? You may have misread the will of the people in that Oblio case. An unruly mob, eh? (laughs) Well, isn't that just the limit? (crowd shouting) - Silence, I demand silence. Can't a man get a little peace and quiet in his own... Say, what are you doing back? (crowd shouting) This litle runt is an outlaw. You're an outlaw, child. You are banished to the Pointless Forest. - And I went to the Pointless Forest, in fact I... - Nonsense, sheer, irrevocable, nonsense. I'll have you in chains for this. Arrest this little... - Hold it, hold it, Count, the boy was saying something. - Yeah, right on, break it down for him, Obi. - Yes, right on Obi. - Well, sir, we did go to the Pointless Forest, Arrow and I, all through it, in fact. And you know something? It isn't pointless at all. - It's not? - What? What? Not pointless? Madness. That's madness. Sheer madness. - Will you be quiet, Count? I want to hear Oblio. Now, Oblio, you were saying? - Well, the fact is, sir, just about everything we ran into had a point to it, the leaves, the trees, everything. - Oh, I see, Obi, well, I can't really argue that one with you, but what about yourself, son? - Well, sir, I figure if everything has a point, then I must have one, too. - He has a point there. (laughs) Villain, treason, public naughtiness. I will not stand by while this pointless person tries to undo the law of the land. My dear and loyal friends, if he had a point, he'd have one. (Count gasps) (trumpets playing) Impossible. - [Father] And so it was, that Oblio and Arrow returned safely from their travels, only a little older, but certainly a good deal wiser. As for the Pointed Village, well, the way things worked out, it was a much better place to live after Oblio's return. True, the people didn't have their once cherished points, right there on top of their heads, put that didn't matter so much anymore. People just started assuming that every man had some kind of a point, whether it shows or not. (dramatic music) - The end. Now that's a story son, is that a story, or... - Yeah, Dad, it was a good story, really. - Good, good, it was great, great story. - Sure, Dad, it was. - I mean it had everything right there, adventure, a little comedy, funny scene or two. There was a lesson. You caught the lesson, didn't you? - Right, Dad, I caught it. - Well, what do you think it was? - Well, just because somebody doesn't have what other people have doesn't mean that you know, they have to be turned out of the kingdom, or something. - [Dad] Hmm, yes. (kisses son) - Dad? - What is it, son? - Thanks for reading me the story. - You're welcome, son.
