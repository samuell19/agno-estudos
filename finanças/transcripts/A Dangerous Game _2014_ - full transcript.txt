This is a letter that I've just received "Though I do not know you I wanted to send a note to let you know the vast majority of Americans would agree with your opposition. I wish you the best of luck in your struggle against Trump, and trust you will find a way to overcome what I see as one of America's worst exports: Arrogant ill-informed billionaires who think they can buy their way into anything." That's the best letter I've had yet. You just wonder if it's all going to end. Donald Trump has officially opened his new golf course in Aberdeenshire. The U.S. tycoon has... One. Well done. Oh, me. Look at the hair. Look at the fat stomach now. He's fairly put on the beef. I expected good but this has surpassed expectation. Does he get paid for that? I think this is great for golf, and what's good for golf is good for Scotland, because Scotland is the home front for golf. This here used to be all full of wildlife, you know? There's no wildlife now, nothing. And I remember way back, Trump says, "Oh, but the wildlife will come back." How can it come back? There's nothing here for 'em to come back to. We don't see any animals here now. We don't see foxes, we don't see deer. The course has turned out almost as badly as I expected. It's golf course number 72, or thereby in Aberdeenshire, not something we were really needing another one of. But when you look at what we've lost here, the protected special scientific interests, unique in the U.K. I've never seen it, but I do see it on TV, you know, from the air, and it just looks like square patches of grass with holes in the middle of it. Boats have always been part of my life. Me and Kim have lived on boats 25 years. We've done everything. We gutted it, and completely redid the front cabin. Took the map table out, put the benches in. This resort Trump is building, it's worn the people down. They're completely fed up with it. Oh, me, me, me. How greedy is Mr. Trump, you know? He lives in a different world. He lives in a totally different world. Another beautiful shot. You didn't need Jack Nicklaus to design these links. Oh, look at that, Anthony. The wildflower, the grass, the sand were all on site. They didn't need to be brought in by bulldozers and dumper trucks. Anthony, this couldn't be better. We've got this all to ourselves, and the one that you like with the steeple is over there. There is written evidence that golf has been played here for 450 years. Beautiful. Oh, gosh. She can play, she can play. They come out either golfing, or looking for golf balls every day, and what I admire about it is it's so natural. Some people have a gadget for this. No. Shit. The earliest photo of me is playing at the age of four. All of us at that stage had to learn the game instinctively. There were no professionals to give us lessons. So one of the clubs, for example, was funded as a Wednesday afternoon club, when the shopkeepers had their holiday, their half holiday. This is a tatty old ball. This is the one I picked out of the ditch. Nowadays, it's a game of the moneyed, and so many private clubs, which are quite beyond the meansof the ordinary golfer. You see my nephew here behind me. Did you see the Trump film by any chance? - Yes. - He made it. - Oh, yours? - That's Anthony. It's the documentary that's proven almost as controversial as its subject. You've Been Trumped premiered in Sheffield this afternoon... Withering in his criticism of an independent film which accused him of bully-boy tactics against local residents, Donald Trump said he hadn't watched it. From what I understand, it was boring. Maybe going back, I have nothing to do on my airplane, I'll watch it on the airplane. Now nobody knew Trump could do that, right? From watching the news and reading the papers of what was going on up there. It's been amazing how popular this whole endeavor's been. I thought I was relatively well-informed about what had happened. And then when I saw You've Been Trumped with 300 other people in a cinema, there was a visceral sense of shock in the room, the stuff that we hadn't been told about, just didn't know about. ...down to the beach, actually, you won't get down there, not with security. Anthony Baxter was filming on Susan Munro's property when this happened. Don't you do that to me! Right, son. That's disgraceful. Will you stop doing that to me! You've Been Trumped is a true story. You will not be seeing this gentleman on The Apprentice any time soon. What's the movie about? It's about Donald Trump building a golf course resort consisting of two golf courses, 1,500 houses, and a skyscraper hotel on an area of wild natural beauty. It's an abuse of power, and I think if this documentary is about one thing, it's that. It's such a universal notion. To see that movie and to see the struggle, immediately we felt sympathyand solidarity with the people. And of course we had to do something about it. Tonight we brought the Illuminator, that's the Occupy Bat signal, over to the Trump Tower so that we could project the You've Been Trumped that details the story of how Donald Trump is bulldozing over the land of the 99 % in Scotland. For a golf course? So that you can jet-set for five hours across the ocean, play a round of golf and head home? I mean, it's just absurd. And so, viewing that hypocrisy, that absurdity, it just made itso clear cut for people. There is a sadness running through your film, a sense of disconsolation, even melancholy that something is slipping away, something is being taken away that you can't bring back. In a sense, the sadness I have felt in doing this film is the loss of something so precious, you know, something that money can't buy. And your film is resonating in many countries around the world. The reason we chose You've Been Trumped almost two years ago to open our Human Rights Film Festival in Zagreb; For people it was immediately obvious that this is something which really connects with them. As if they were watching their own future. It's the film featuring Donald Trump. He has the toupee. Can you compare the project in Scotland with this one on Srd? I was very struck by the similarities. In Scotland what we had was a wilderness area, a sand dune system. In Dubrovnik there is Mount Srd, which is a wilderness area and the last part of the city that could be developed. This is a very arid area. Golf was not invented in the Mediterranean, it was invented in Scotland. In other words, you need lots of water to facilitate something like golf. And we do not have much water around here. We have to bring an enormous supply of water. What do you think it would look like, coming in and seeing all that infrastructure up there? I just don't agree with that golf course. I actually started to see the thing when you came with the... with this program here. I look at Mr. Forbes and his disgusting conditions in which he lives. Why the Scottish police were so partial on the part of Donald Trump, and not on the part of their own people? After that, I said, "Come on." If somebody from outside is getting interested for my city, then probably I should. I hope it isn't gonna bring you to some sort of jail or anything like that, like it happened in England. Ten years ago, you could not imagine. We've experienced so many ugly things in this village. I'm afraid for the nature, for me myself, for all inhabitants. And this is where it happened. This is where I was attacked. Here he parked his motorcycle. He ran to me, he hit me, and put pepper spray into my eye, and, uh, run off. That's another police document. That's medical document about injury of my daughter. A few months later, a phone call arrived. It was directed to my father, saying that he either leaves the land on Srd, or he... they will kill his daughter. They will kill me. Srd is ours! My profession deals with the history of the city with incredible importance. So I'm always trying to send this message about the importance of our history and the tradition. To speak about it to my school kids. And you know, it's not only important to speak, it's also very important to act. Srd is ours! Our second demand isabout another of your promises. That you reveal the complete list of ownership of housing plots on Srd. It is a cultural, educational and creative center. This is the only place in Dubrovnik where you can learn how to sew and make your own clothes. This is a place where you start building your dignity. Today in these consumeristic times, it's very important to use resources that are from your local community. We like to call it Dubrovnik in a jar. People can gather and learn that can help them learn some valuable skills get out of job centers and start working and start making money for themselves. Dubrovnik is protected by UNESCO as a World Heritage site, so with the city walls and the lovely harbor, but also with the whole environment around it. Dubrovnik citizens are saying "Ah, well, what can we do?" I believe we need to make them angry. We need to wake up this fighting spirit in them for their own city. It seems the Mayor doesn't understand what he signs. For the second time he has broken his promise about holding a Referendum as he pushes the Srd development on the people. My father was on the mountain Srd. It was the last defense for the city, and after the war my father isnot the same person, of course. With some traumas you can't just deal with it. We are here in the atomic shelter underground, you know, calling all day long on the cell phones. We are coordinating all the volunteers. We dispatch them, is that the word? - Yes. - Around places. This here is basically a transcript of a radio jingle. "Dear citizens, in order for the referendum to happen we need your signatures. Your signature means I want to freely decide on the future of my city." We are going to park here. As you can see, holes on the wall. It's from the grenades. I don't know whose smart idea was it to give this fort in concessionto the golf developers. They put signs. "Danger: Golf development." So, yes. Yes, I believe you are quite dangerous. This is one of the places where the soldiers were during the war, and my father was one of them. So this is the boats. Slavija. They took us from Dubrovnik to Rijeka, then from Rijeka we took a train to Germany. My aunt lives there. That day I thought I wouldn't have a place to come back home. I mean, they defended themselves. It was a miracle, you know? It's like David and Goliath. It's just like what we are doing. Dubrovnik is just a small group of people, and in spite of everything they are doing it, you know, with the best will, with... I mean, it's really inspiring. We are heading to a suburb of Dubrovnik. Your signatures are required for the referendum on Srd. Hey Vlaho, what's up? I am driving to Mokoica to collect signatures. - What happened inside? - We filed a motion. This is unprecedented. I have never heard of this, let alone seen it in real life, and never thought that on the verge of Croatia entering the European Union, you can see censorship in the publicly owned media. We didn't write on the leaflet the date from which we are collecting the signatures, and until what date. 15,000 of these that we have to correct. Today, the second day of collecting the signatures, we also started at seven a.m. Our team was here at the green market in Gruz and we got a few dozen signatures, so we are happy so far. Too many resorts, too many hotels. Devastating for this area. And we're gonna have one person responsible for the lists, and there is 100 of them. So any ideas on how to make it simple are really welcome. Do you want to give your signature? Oh, you did already! Most of the people who are passing by already signed, and I believe we are now a pain in the ass for those people. Sorry for the language. Oh, my God! Please don't say that to me! This is making of history. Completed 6,100. Just want to compare how much we collected today in comparison with yesterday. There is news about us. And they say despite the media blockade, we gathered over 5,000 signatures so far. Seventy-five hundred finished sheets, and a few more which we started, but will be finished soon. Dubrovnik presented us with an opportunity to work in an emerging market with a great partner. We hope to accentuate the natural environment in the design scheme and improve the existing wildlife habitats. The goal is to create nature, green space for enjoyment for golfers, and the creatures that inhabit the land. A long time ago, there was a man from this village... and he was very skinny. And he would go inside to cleanthe small rocks and sand. - He'd go in the hole? - Yes, he would go inside. And, uh, to pick up all the sand. And he said that it goes straight, and then it goes right. This is where my family stays for eight generations. I grow everything, like olives, you know, everything I produce. We could lose the water completely, you know what I mean? You don't know. It's so dangerous, you know. Because somebody has a full bag of money some place. I don't know anyone that plays golf, and I don't like the idea, I don't feel comfortable with it. I don't want to live in a place that is going to force this upon me. This is going to demand continuous care, an enormous amount of water, and it will look as something out of some other part of the world. For example, in America they have developed some of these golf fields in desert areas. We're driving through what's called a master planned community. The residents that live here live behind gated communities. In addition, there are at least three golf courses and a series of hotels and condominiums as well as the private homes for the people that can afford them. We get a little bit hotter here 'cause we're lower than Las Vegas, so our temperatures are three to five degrees hotter. Probably 105, that's what it usually is every day out here. This was developed and built, it's a man made lake, and it's filled with over three billion gallons of water. And where does that water come from? It's important to know that that water is all drinking water. It comes from the city of Henderson. The developer has purchased that amount of water to fill Lake Las Vegas. Every year, the lake has to be refilled. Most of these homes go for well over a million dollars. Over two million, like in this area, and then for the lots alone when you get down on the lake those are going for like, four million. And then Celine Dion lives on this hole, on the right hand side. Joining me now is one of the world's leading environmentalists, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's founder and president of the Water Keeper Alliance. Communities like Las Vegas are continuing to encourage sprawl development, build golf courses in the desert, and these are huge, these are becoming greater and greater issues. The Colorado River no longer even reaches the sea. It dries up in the Sonoran Desert. It's your passion, it's your future. It's the BGA Worldwide Golf Exhibition set against the backdrop of Fashion Week in Las Vegas. There's lots of Donald Trumps out there. There's people like him in every country, and in every community. The most important golf events of the year. Golf is a multi-billion dollar business that actually touches a number of different components including real estate, golf course development, rounds played, merchandise such as apparel and equipment that you'll see on the show floor here. They're made with a CNC computerized milling machine. A CNC computerized milling machine. - It's a milling machine, yeah. - What's that? Um... it's a computerized CNC. I don't even know what CNC stands for. We all golf and so she already has her own putter. - She has her putter? - Yes. - How big is that? - Oh, it's just little. It would load our app in about .four seconds onto your phone. So then you would go and get your cart, go out on the course, and let's say you're out on the course and you want something. It could be food, it could be beer, it could be I ran out of balls, I ran out of tees. It's a hot day, I need a cool cloth on my neck. And then if you go and install one of those machines - how much would it cost? - Uh, ballpark. Ten grand. This unit measures 24 inches of flight. It takes the issue of decompression out. Well, some of them we call mailbox cars, just run down to the mailbox to check the mail. You go to the middle school or the high school and there'll be a bunch of golf carts lined up out front. Starts around $55,000 to 75, 80, depending on the custom job. You know, some people want to put all turf down so it's a full golf room. And here today to talk about better technology and how to sell it to your customers. We've been able to do that by looking at the whole club holistically. So not just the head design. But how the shaft and the mass properties and the whole club really behave together as a unit. Now is the time to put the hand up. This is my first time at the PGA Expo. My mother was a keen golfer, I don't actually golf. But I'm just struck looking around the room here how it's 98 % male. All right, who wants to tackle that? I'm not touching that one. With the technology increasing every month and every year say within ten years are we going to see all our golf courses too short? It used to be like, $200,000 to join, but once kind of the foreclosure happened, the hotel shut down, a lot of the businesses went out of business, and then when they didn't sell it that's when they laid off all the guys, and they just kept two guys, one that's a mechanic and an irrigator, and they just do the bare minimum. The greens are all dead, so they'll all have to be regrown. Everything started going down, it just crumbled out here. This is a parking garage that would service the restaurants and the casino. - And it's empty. - And it's empty. It's just now recovering from bankruptcy. Often, a golf course is built, and it's supposed to attract a lot of jobs and investment. Correct. But it doesn't always happen that way? No. Well, that's kind of... You can kind of see from across the thing. The casino shut down, and if you go around the shops, a lot of the shops are still vacant down there in the village. It's kind of sad, I don't even like walking down there. You hear this repeated again and again and again, that we have to choose between economic prosperity on the one hand and environmental protection on the other, and that's a false choice. In 100 percent of the situations good environmental policy is identical to good economic policy. The site has good terrain that you are looking for in a golf course site, and it offers dramatic views of the prevailing mountain ranges and the Adriatic Sea. Some are saying that it is not good for people to get rich in Dubrovnik. But Aaron Frenkel is already rich. And with this golf project he will make residents richer. It will be beautiful, because rich people will come to live in these villas. They will need people to work for them. They will come with their yachts. Now we are coming to our marina. It's a good opportunity to mix golf and sailing. It's always empty. It was just for the peasants. For the animals. For nothing. It is an investor's development, denying the needs of the town. This is natural frame of the historic town. And this is in all theories andall practice of conservation. The price of this housing is astronomic. It's priceless, because you are overlooking the historic town and sea. Rich people who can afford to play golf, guaranteed money. All classy like Paris Hilton sisters - they come. All our villas will be overlooking the Dubrovnik Park Golf Course. In the summer, this is all grey. Because nobody puts on water. A big water system there all year round, especially in June, July and August all this will be greener than it is now. This water is, first of all, going to be used for something that is not of principal interest to the city. But also, it's going to be seeping, as part of the process of fertilization, into this forest landscape, with totally unpredictable consequences. To despoil it, in one major thrust, at this point, I think would be a serious disservice to the future generations. They need to have an airport which Dubrovnik has. You need an old city, something like Monte Carlo. We have marina - third. And the fourth thing which is most important is golf. For Dubrovnik to be a world destination they need number four thing which is golf. This building lobby has the idea of making money now, and after they build something that nobody will use in the end, they reach some kind of calculation. They, I don't know, buy cheap land, build giant houses, and, uh... ...everything goes corrupt after that. With golf, a businessman from Zagreb called me and asked have I any land where they can make a discotheque. So, yes, I have here! There's plenty of wood on public land. Go! Then I do all this work for nothing. If they make these gated communities, yeah, it will feel horrible. It would feel like someone robbed the cradle. The feeling, you know, itdoesn't bring you profit, right? The main issue with the gates is that they're locked, permanently locked. When my husband was ill, we used to push him down the road in his wheelchair, and same with my mother when she was ill, and we certainly wouldn't be able to do that anymore. By Scots law, you are entitled to access any land, even golf courses. There's another bit of new fencing here, see? Trump, he put up a fence where I used to go down. That's where I've been doing my summer fishing. The police were there when he put it up. And they said if I touch that fence, I will be charged. With damaging the fence and damaging his property if I go through his golf course. This is not fair because we can't get anywhere. That shouldn't be on there. There are locked gates all over the place, galvanized steel gates. Trump's a bad man to fall out with, but... You know, he shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. Well, see, I happen to be a very truthful person. His property is terribly maintained, it's slum-like, it's disgusting. He's got stuff thrown all over the place. He lives like a pig. Good evening and welcome to the annual Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards. This really is a national institution. And we are gathered here tonight to recognize and pay tribute to all those who in the last 12 months who surpassed themselves in their chosen fields, and have flown the flag for Scotland. As always, there were many strong contenders for the Top Scot title this year, including Olympic heroes Sir Chris Hoy... Chris Hoy, he's driving to the line, and he's won it! He's won the keirin Olympic title. ...Andy Murray... Match point in the Gold Medal match at the Olympic Games. And it was three aces to win it! ...and Billy Connolly. You see that nice, white building? And then Trump stuck that thing in the middle. He wants to be the president. And the man who's known more for his actions than by his name. His story and the unfolding battle attracted international coverage in the recent You've Been Trumpedfilm. I look at Mr. Forbes and his disgusting conditions in which he lives. Then you get all these people that's supporting you, it's really good, yeah. Some things will always be worth more than money. The winner of the 2012 Top Scot Award is... ...Michael Forbes. I've never stood up in front of people before. Cameras are not a problem. Speaking to reporters is not a problem. But going up on that stage was a problem! I'm speechless. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much. I am speechless. That's all I can say. Everybody in the place was coming up to me, and congratulating me. High-class people, you know. Celebrities, big stars. They were all coming up. And they says I deserved it. Right, can everybody gather round Michael? The fact that he was being personally vilified and picked out for scorn and abuse by this multi-billion corporation. I think the tides of public opinion is very much turned against that. Everybody was saying I was the best that they could have chosen. What have I done to deserve it? I don't know. It's two years since I finished filming You've Been Trumped, and now the Trump Organization have offered me a chance to come and meet them completely out of the blue. I think, you know, perhaps we should have spoken a lot sooner, the past is the past. But are you available on Thursday? I'm just hoping I'm not arrested. Our goal for the meeting is to clarify what we can for you. It's not to make your next movie. Do we really believe that Michael Forbes is more accomplished in the minds of the average Scot than Andy Murray? He's not this simple crofter than, you know, he's tried to... been made into. It's just nonsense-- But do you understand why-- He's created a junkyard in his backyard. He is seen as the face of the 99 %. - That is why it resonated. - Ninety-nine percent of what? - The ordinary person. - It's absurd. He's stood in the way ofprogress, that's what he's done. And that seems to be the sentiment of all the people that we've spoken to, whether it be a dinner last night in town, when we ask a couple people or they recognize us. We'll strike up a conversation, we'll say, "So what are your thoughts on that?", so we can hear the voice of what would be the people. When I was at the Queen's Hall last time in November, it was the night of the Top Scot Award. He's called Michael Forbes. Between his farm and the coast, is the Trump International Golf Links. Donald Trump and the Trump Corporation banned sales of Glenfiddich at all their hotels. And lo and behold, there was the largest weekend sales of Glenfiddich in its history. And so now you can think of drinking whiskey as an act of political subversion. Michael Forbes, he represents everybody. He's an ordinary man, trying to just live his life and maintain his own dignity and his own space. Karine Polwart. Karine Polwart's record, when I first heard it, I nearly cried. I'm gonna dedicate this first song to a farmer and a former salmon fisherman from Aberdeenshire, and he cannot fish anymore because between his house and the sea is the Trump International Golf Links. I had to walk out of the room. I couldn't hear it. It was so... so close to, um... ...something. It was very moving. ♪ And the tide still ebbs and flows ♪ ♪ Where the Ythan meets the ocean ♪ ♪ Not even God himself ♪ ♪ Could stop the northerlies from blowing ♪ ♪ You can tear these dunes asunder ♪ ♪ Pound this wonder into dust ♪ ♪ With your cruel hands and crooked hearts ♪ ♪ Laden with lust and expensive lies ♪ ♪ But the haar will stumble in to cover your eyes ♪ ♪ The haar will stumble in ♪ Look at the height of it. Look, it's still going up. It was supposed to come down to 1.5 meters, that's what the council said. I think Findlay has the letter. Well, if you read, there's three pages. This is in the car park, and, uh... ...reduction height of the building, 1.5 meters. Removal of three lighting columns immediately adjacent to the boundary with Leighton Cottage. If he wants to do it, he does it, and nobody seems to say boo-hoo. I don't think anybody else would get away with that, would they? It's more than doubled, it's now four meters. The plan says a meter and a half down. When's it ever going to end? It's like being in a prison. It really is just awful. Look at the mess. The behavior of the current estate owner, towards those who are owning houses on the estate, or at least towards some of them, has been deplorable, and has been repeatedly deplorable. He carted... Oh, it must have been thousands and thousands of the dumper loads to build the mounds in front of the Munros'. And it's very, very difficult to interpret some of the actions as anything other than a deliberate campaign of intimidation and bullying to make lives as difficult as possible for the neighbors. Hear the water? Just drip, drip, drip. That's all I get. Still taking water from the bottom. Even have to wash myself with water from the bottom. I've tried the Council, I've tried the Water Board, I've tried everybody. When Trump built that road up there for the lorries and things, they crushed my pipe. There's a line of dead trees. That's where my well is. That's the pipes that they crushed. Never no problems 'till Trump came here. Hi, I'm Anthony, Anthony, filmmaker. - Oh, yes.-This is Richard, my colleague. We were just filming with Michael Forbes this morning, and he was saying that he hasn't had any water for a week. That's right. There was a problem with the well. We'll have to investigate it first, to re-instate the man's water. So it'll be a jewel of a system and sustain itself. It'll be the best system he's ever had for supplying water to his house. How's that? It's not nice. She used to shower every day, you know? It caused me a lot more work pushing my wheelbarrow up from the stream. You're having to take water? - Yes. - Is that what's happened? That's from the stream. Well, I think all these disturbances about the water and lack of water has an effect on Molly. Give any person a situation where the water doesn't come out of the tap, and their lives will be turned upside down. That's it in this little bucket. I just heat it up in there, and then wash my dishes. I don't waste that. I use it to flush the toilet. I'm sure I don't remember it looking that tidy. It's an open space. It's got useable things scattered all over it. Trailers and diggers and tractors are things you use. - Sheila. - Hey. - How you doing? - Not bad, yourself? Not bad. Is Mickey in? - He's just coming. - Is he? - He was up looking at the well.-Ah. And they were kicking upabout my stuff down there. And what did they do with theirs? They buried it. When equivalent things were on his neighbors' property, Mr. Trump was using it as justification for getting his neighbor removed from their property. Councilors and Salmond, they ought to grow a backbone, you know? And start fighting Trump 'cause this is no good, what's happening down here. The independence is not at its heart about this party, or this administration, or this First Minister, but about fundamental democratic choice for Scotland. He's the First Minister for Scotland, but because he's the local constituency, MSP and the area where the Trump International Golf Links is sited, a lot of people are disappointed. And until I think we have a proper explanation of why it occurred and what the thinking on it is now, then there's always the possibility that that could happen again. I would have come through that gate and have come across here. That's another thing that nobody else would have got off with, is building a paved road in the links. Every other golf course has gota dust path, you know? And it's only so they can get to the greens quicker with their chemicals. Donald Trump's proposal to build two golf courses and a housing development on the Aberdeenshire coastline at Menie has been controversial for years. And today, MSP's heard a call for a full public inquiry into the whole process. It's about the protections the planning system is meant to provide communities like ours, and to environments like the now destroyed Triple SI at Menie. The behavior of the police in relation to bias and inappropriate activity also requires review and investigation. Like you, I'm struggling to find out exactly what this petition wants to do 'cause it seems to be all over the place. What would this inquiry actually do? Is this just a few disgruntled individuals? You don't get a 19,000 signature petition on the basis of a few disgruntled individuals. The responses that came back after a number of weeks were of the order, "No, we've done nothing wrong, so there's no need to ask any further." At least Scotland denied that they had been part of some major conspiracy, which I think was what was being suggested to us when we took evidence, that they had been cooperating with Mr. Trump's organization. For those reasons, I'm actually in favor of closing this petition. Members agreeable? I agree we should shut the thing. They've taken about two and a half minutes to effectively ignore the opinion of the best part of 20,000 U.K. voters. At the end of the day, Salmond's supposed to be in charge, isn't he? So I would say the buck stops with him. If he can't sort it out, nobody can. Mr. Salmond, why don't you take a visit here and see what it's like living here. Bet he wouldn't have put up with this around his house. A standing ovation for the SNP Alex Salmond from the delegates... Alex Salmond knows what's going on, but he's never taken the time to go and see his constituents. And I think that's a disgrace, you know. He owes them a duty of care, to address the issues that they're having difficulties with. And Michael's been in communication, I've seen the letters. You know, they're all very worthy letters but nothing happens. Alex Salmond wrote me a letter congratulating me on my Top Scot Award. So I phoned him up to see if I could get my access opened again, for my right of way, and the public right of way. I got a letter back. "A letter is currently being drafted that can be sent from you to Trump." And I haven't heard anymore about it. If he was to help me, he would come down here and see what's going on. It goes back to the Magna Carta. It's a recognition that this is one of the fundaments of democracy. Which is the government's role in allocating the commons, the publicly owned resource to make sure that they can be used by everybody, and that they're not just a plaything of the wealthy. It's an aspiration. So for the new rich in China, to move next to a golf course says that they've reached some sort of status in their life. Just huge, huge golf complexes, bigger than anywhere else in the world. They're illegal, the golf courses. Technically illegal, yes. You're dealing with a lot of corruption. We're about to enter the grounds of the most anticipated course design project ever conceived. The Tiger Woods Dubai pairs the world's most recognizable athletes with one of the United Arab Emirates most experienced business conglomerates, and the results are sure to be spectacular. The idea is that we wanted to create a benchmark in the golfing industry, the most sought after destination worldwide. And the most important aspect is that we've moved twenty-five million cubic meters of sand, which is a phenomenal number for anywhere in the desert. And our grass has been flown in from Georgia, which is the same type of grass that Augusta actually uses. We have seven and a half million square feet of lakes. Just like anywhere else in the world, there are water supply concerns, and there are pesticide concerns when it comes to golf courses in China. Even if there's a regulation in place, you can't be sure that it was enforced properly. And that's usually a recipe for disaster. Our concern is that fertilizers are getting into the aquifer, that it's going to enter the little tributaries and streams and end up in the water supply. Any propertydevelopment has to be measured, I think, or should be measured in terms of what's the overall impact, and who's gonna pay ifsomething catastrophic happens? Fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides are all essential to some degree to maintain a beautiful golf course. This is actually a private club. You can't take any pictures of it. Think of it like this. We have in a sort of metaphorical sense, an underground lake. And if this lake was visible at the surface it'd be very easy to point at it and say, "See all of this water? We're going to call it a reservoir." What we have here is the top of a water supply system that nature created. All we have to do is not mess it up. We share the water with spotted wintergreen, and the American beech. In the case of the trees, they stand sentinel over the water supply and prevent adverse land uses unless you cut them down. The question arises is what is the role of people in the community? And thank goodness that we have Alec Baldwin, and other concerned citizens who take the time to read the voluminous reports that caution about land uses, such as golf courses, inside of special groundwater protection areas. So the real worry here was that the chemicals that were gonna be put on the golf course could end up in the water supply. Right. Golf courses just pound water on them. They just water them all the time, and that drives the chemicals into the root zone, and then down beyond the root zone, while they're still active. We can see the leaves are changing, and yet the golf course is as green as if it was the middle of summer. That's done with application of chemicals. These chemicals are designed to break down and become "inert" in the root zone before they hit the water table. And very often, that does not happen with golf courses, so we argued all these things and we lost, the town board granted him his permit, he did indeed build the golf course. And the monitoring wells that were put in for this golf course avoided many of the greens. Can I ask what you're doing out here? We're looking at your beautiful golf course. Okay, why is he filming? Because it's a beautiful golf course. - What's your name? - My name is Steve. - Steve? - Englebright. - Englebright? Okay. - What's your name? Patrick Bistrian, I'm an owner out here. - Oh, you're a Bistrian. - Yeah, yeah. - Of the sandpit fame. - Uh, golf course fame too. The Bistrians are long-time residents of East Hampton. Will you stop filming? Stop filming. We're just doing some filming about the golf course and aquifer. Okay, all right, get off the property right now. Let's go, get out of here. Hey, stop filming. Whoa. He's on public property now. There, you want me to call the cops? No, not particularly. Yeah, I wouldn't think you would. But if you're going to, you're going to. I will. As you can see, it's very difficult to monitor what chemicals are being used, whether there is contamination as a result of activities that have taken place here in the last decade. We have to be hyper vigilant because as soon as you take the eye off the ball people like Donald Trump are going to move in there and corrupt that democracy and to twist it so that it serves his private economic interests rather than serving the public interest, and the interests of future generations. Welcome to the 14th hole ofTrump International Golf Links. I have just found out a moment ago that Mr. Joseph Cinque, who is the president for the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences is here with us today topresent us with a special award. Joseph. Good morning. This golf course, and only one, is the best in the world. And for me to be here to bestow this award is very important, 'cause we could not give another. Only one. And we selected, members of the Academy, together we selected this property. And you're very lucky, the people of Scotland, to have a Trump property like this. I'd never thought I'd give the best in the world today, but here it is. I want everybody to be aware of it. Can you turn this way, please? That's nice. - Oh, yes, yes, sure. - Drop it down. See the course, you see it? You want to bring it down more? I find it rather laughable to say the least. Thank you, everybody, very much. I just want to thank Mr. Cinque. This is really an honor. This was unexpected, totally. I mean, you've got three trustees right there at the top of the page and the man in the middle, whom they describe as"an ambassador extraordinaire", is Donald Trump himself. That's a great honor. Thank you, wow. As you could read, it'sthe best golf course worldwide, and no one will ever have an award like this. If you're gonna receive an awardfrom your own organization it kind of devalues it a little bit. When are people gonna stop preaching the Trump rubbish, you know? Look at the situation as it is really, and what is happening to local people, really. And then he's got the cheek to complain about the windmills? Huh? God. I cannot build a very, very, very expensive hotel that's looking into an industrial wind farm. Donald Trump claims it's going to ruin the view. You can see the lighthouse. It's around about the same height as they will be. I don't think they're going to affect the view from here at all. After all, the immediate foreground's already been trashed. In classic Donald Trump style, the business tycoon swept into the Scottish Parliament, shot from the hip and left. He's tried to meddle in the whole issue of whether or not we should have wind farms in that part of the world, so he's deliberately stuck his nose into Scottish political affairs and expected his voice because he's influential to trump others. The 230 million pound development will see 11 turbines in the sea off Aberdeen's shores. They'll generate enough electricity to power half of the city's homes, but crucially supporters say the project will be a major test center for turbine technology. Your wind program will take down Scotland. You have to be very careful. Where is the clinical evidence? Not an opinion, an empirical assessment. Where is your clinical evidence? Who has produced it? Will you share it with the committee? Well, first of all, I am the evidence. I think I'm more of an expert... You know what? I think I'm a lot more of an expert than the people that you'd like me to hire who are doing it to make a paycheck. But I am an expert in tourism. I am considered a world-class expert in tourism, so when you say where is the expert, and where is the evidence, I'm the evidence. Mr. Trump, you say wind farms are destroying Scotland's environment-- I am chairing this meeting... He's got a failed documentary, so... Trump out, Trump out! Trump out! Trump out! I'm angry because he's come here with his billions, used his money to exert huge amounts of influence and disguise government, whereby Alex Salmond overrides the decision of Aberdeen Council and allows him to build what is effectively a small townon the Menie Estate, on the pretense that it's a couple of golf courses. The man is a bully and a liar. He's a fine example of one percent of the population controlling 99 % of the power and influence. Donald Trump says he intends to submit plans for a second golf course at the Menie Estates in Aberdeenshire. That'd be the second course over there. See where that security, that white truck is? That's the security, see that nobody transgresses Trump's property. So effectively, about a six, seven mile stretch of the coast is inaccessible. The entire area to the north comprises golf course number two, which involves quite spectacularsand dune systems as well. And so it was really quite beyond belief, the planning authorities and the Scottish government have given outlying planning consent for a golf course to extend all the way down without a shred of plan, without any environmental impact statement being produced. We've heard your question. Donald Trump came face to face with filmmaker Anthony Baxter. Mr. Trump, will you be carrying out an environmental assessment plan - for the second golf course? - Yes, we will. We're very, very careful in the environment. I actually consider myself to be a great environmentalist, and we are doing a very, very strong plan. Because Scotland's leading expert on coastal erosion, I've got a quote from him here, he says the golf course number two is going ahead without a shred of plan, without any environmental impact statement being produced for the northern part of the Balmedie sand dunes. He's not an expert because he doesn't know what he's talking about. Here is my expert. Martin, come over here. This is the great Martin Hawtree. How much sand will have to be moved, Martin, during the construction phase? Um... it depends on how much we, uh, want to try and replicate links features on the other spit of ground. Why do you want to do another one? Because I think the first one is a success. I think you move forward with the rest of the media. Yeah, I'm just speaking to Martin. - We've done the media bit. - No, I'm walking with him. Please, just move. We have to get to a meeting. So what would you think if I told you the area over there is gonna be developed into a golf course for wealthy people? I think it would be a bit sad unless it was available to all the public, I guess. Yeah, it's a shame to destroy it if it's only just gonna be for a couple of people - to get to it. - I'm all for Donald Trump. I think pumping money into the local economy is very good, so he's got my backing, basically, yeah. Do you have quite a few heated discussions in the pub? Yeah, we do, yeah. Like I said, the majority of people are against it, but I try to explain to them the oil won't be here forever. No one is benefiting other than a small... How much are people getting paid at the golf course, the bartender, the guy that's handing you a towel, and the caddies, and the guy that's parking your car. These people aren't making six figures. You know, no one's making a lot of money, maybe the management is. Certainly the owners are. Eleven thousand. For me, the highest point was with the volunteers. I feel like their energy is so positive. They were huge believers that we will succeed. The election committee has six persons overseen by a President. We, the volunteers, we made everything so the referendum happens and the mayor didn't do anything. Even yesterday, Penguin from the Batman invited people to actively stay at home. What kind of person does that? What do you think of the mayor of Dubrovnik at the moment? He's called on people to boycott the referendum. Do you think that's a good idea? Yes, it's good. It's a rich man's sport, you know. You need proper equipment for playing golf. Is there a golf ball around? It's not my kind of sport. Full bus. Who are the villains here? All of them, you know. It's the Mayor. It's also the Prime Minister. It's the former Prime Minister that really enabled this. Also the former President. Every project will destroy something to a certain extent. But I think you can choose good projects and just, you know, leave something for future generations. Four years ago the coalition that now runs the city promised the citizens of Dubrovnik a referendum on the golf resort. It must be stopped if we want to preserve the spirit of the city. If we want to protect the culture and heritage that our ancestors passed down to us. Dubrovnik is Croatian and world heritage site. And we are responsible to it. We have to act. This is our duty. We need three volunteers who will go tomorrow and be the whole day on those three islands near Dubrovnik. Anya and me, we are going to an island. We suffered so much to be independent and I'm proud how much respect and democracy in the act we experience by volunteering, by organizing things. Srd is ours! I'm so happy, that they'll have a chance to say what they think. We hope that huge majority of the people will say no to the project. Here will be a golf course. This is where the golf course comes. All of this - restaurants. Everything will be raised up! Golf course. 100 % privacy. Nobody can overlook you. Never. I vote against golf. I just think it's too much for this little place to have that much houses and everything. I'm just doing what I think is right. Tell me how you voted in there today. Uh, against. According to our data, eighty percent of people were against the project, while 20 percent of people were for the project. For the first time in 20 years, I see people of Dubrovnik walking proudly, and with their smiles on their faces. Sorry. It's... it's very exciting. Sorry. Yeah. I'm happy. These are tears of happiness. We picked up a copy of the national newspaper. The wife of an investor saying that regardless of the outcome of the referendum golf will be built. The National Government shouldn't be bothered with the Referendum because this golf project is of national benefit. It is good for the people of Dubrovnik. It is good for Croatia. In spite of the fact that people are against the project, this still doesn't mean anything. We celebrated together with representatives of the Golf Park. Lamb, music - it was nice. The Mayor and Maja Frenkel said that next year we are building. It's now certain that we'll start Phase One. I think they are gloating because the Mayor did everything that he could just to obstruct the Referendum. They decided that they don't want the Referendum to succeed in a way that it'sobligatory to the city council. 85 % voted against the Srd golf course development. That sounds a pretty clear signal from the democratic process, does it not? Yes, that is one kind of democratic process, you know. So from that result then, the project is there? 85 % of the people who go to the referendum say we don't want any houses on Srd. We don't need any houses or any villas any hotels, any apartments. So the project is not gonna go ahead because of that result? - No, no. - Why not? Because that sounds a pretty clear message that's been sent out by the people. For what? - To not build. - No. In Croatia we have a stupid lawabout a Referendum. I'm sorry, 85 % of people who voted yesterday said they do not want this resort to go ahead. No, no. Okay. Wherever you see large-scale environmental injury you'll also see the subversion of democracy. The two things go hand in hand. They always do. Democracy has to be local ultimately. So that a local community can say no to a golf course, and they're not gonna be overruled by some "higher authority" that has been corrupted by corporations, or individuals, or just crooks, to steal something that belongs to that local community and that has been set aside for local use. How much water will be used on the golf course? One million cubic meters per year. The environmentalists say that a third of the available water supply available-- You know that is a stupid question. You can ask me... if you have a few questions If you don't have we can finish this conversation. - Okay, let's talk about-- - Not your opinion. I don't care about your opinion. Who are you? You're not a candidate for Mayor. Why not answer the question? Our reserves of pure clean water is incredible. Enough for half of Italy. But you'll be aware that the people who opposed the development say this is not a good use of a precious resource, to pour water onto a rocky-- - You know, this is-- - ...onto a rocky plain. And to produce a golf course which isn't native to this environment. That is so stupid an ecological question. - So stupid. - Why? - Because. - How many tons of chemicals will be used on the golf course? Do you know that? Um, very few. How do you know that? We've got ecological studies. We've got all approvals from independent ecological activities, including the former Minister for Ecological-- You'll be aware the two associations, - Green Action and-- - I know, Green Action. ...have filed a lawsuit as I understand it against the Environment Protection Ministry over the Ministry's assessment. Thank you very much for your time. We couldn't speak on that level, because I am Mayor and a medical doctor. And you couldn't ask me something about ecological question which I didn't know. Mr. Vlahusic, why didn't you resign when you were indicted on corruption charges? Crooks! Party of crooks! As I said before, I consider myself to be a great environmentalist.I've won many awards, I've done jobs in Bedminster, New Jersey and other places that have gotten awards and accolades. It's about drinking water supplies. New Jersey is the nation's most densely populated state. We don't get the rainfall. This is our most valuable resource. The future, I mean, it's a global concern. It's just irresponsible to be giving it to Donald Trump, to make sure that his greens are, um, green for golf. It's crazy. If you have a golf course that's using public water you need to pass the full cost of the public water onto Trump. Whatever he takes out, whatever he has permission for, and whatever he ultimately takes out, he should pay the market value. What's everybody else? What's the delicatessen down the street that's making sandwiches for the guys that cut the grass? What's he paying? Look at those greens. I mean, they're very lush. How many chemicals does it take to do that? The least amount possible. We have an integrated pest management plan, and the worst thing you can do is over-fertilize it. But either way, we make sure we have settling ponds and we have filtration mechanisms. So environmentally you'd say you're very conscious? I am. I'm much less of a golfer than I am an outdoorsman. But you understand how some people might say having seen the photographs of you in Africa on a hunting trip. You understand the problem in today's Internet age, you see a picture of you with an elephant's tail in your hand, then you're talking about environmental concern. Anything can be spun a certain way. A lot of money was raised for conserving those lands for anti-poaching leagues, for the game rangers and the people who protect them, we always donate shoes and boots and everything like that becausethese are parts of the world where, as sad as it sounds, owning one shoe is a luxury. Two is almost unheard of. Say, for example, this course here. Three hundred thousand dollars roughly to join the club? - No, no. - For the life membership? No, no, no. No? How much is it? Uh, right now I believeit's $150,000 to join the club. And then you have your dues as well on top? Yeah, the dues. Right, right, right. If 300 people... Say, for example, in Scotland, in town where I am, it's 300 pounds to join the club and it's open, it's free for children under the age of seven, anybody can play the course. We have those courses too. It's just in this market, what people want here is security, they want legitimacy they want quality. When you have to enter the wens as I do, you need to be well-armed. And so I've got two pairs of trousers, three layers on top, welder's gloves. See that bramble, I mean, that would tear you to pieces. The reason I started looking for golf balls, there are two reasons. One, during the war, if you didn't find golf balls, you didn't play because they weren't making them. And secondly, I'm not a very good golfer, so I know where they go. See if it catches the top, Anthony. I've got one. It's great what you're doing in there, Denis. Trying to get out, actually. That looks like a class one once it's been washed. That probably will go to Oxfam. Yes, it's too good for the junior practicing. I started recording them in a very sort of compulsive, neurotic way, and discovered that in some years I was getting over 5,000 in a year. That was year 2009. If I give them on the course and they say, "Can I pay you for them?" And I just say, "No, the next time you're passing Oxfam", and I trust them to drop a pound in or something. That's another five dozen. Mr. Trump, could I justask you about Bedminster? - You mentioned it there. - I don't want to talk about-- 'Cause you mentioned about the environmental accolades. I spoke to the Raritan Rainwater's Association. They were talking about the amount of water that it uses. In New Jersey, by law, before water can be sold for large, depletive uses it has to be a public use and necessity. Now, by definition, a private golf course is not a public use, and certainly an exclusive golf course like Trump National is not a public use. I wasn't an English major in school, but I haven't seen a dictionary yet where "necessity" and "luxury" are synonyms. What you're doing is important because what I think the impact of your work will do is get people to think about it, think about, "Hey, there may bea better way of doing it", there may be a better way of using less chemicals and less water, and provide certain environmental enhancements. Don't worry about that, Ed. He'll edit all that stuff out. Well, your video can make a difference if you get people to think about how to do it better. To get to the truth of what actually happens. What's the truth, Anthony? I mean, that's... There's truth as you see it, there's truth as we see it. Hi, Anthony. How are you? That's Anthony over there. - Oh, there's Anthony. - Richard here. I think we just need to pop a radio mic on. Yeah. Want to do this? Could I have those documents? Yeah, that'd be fine. Just so I can reference 'em. These are some of the great reviews we've had on the course. Thank you. This bother you, Anthony, that it sticks out so far? You know, normally it's even with the... ...you don't even see it. Is this your primary camera for me? Mr. Trump, thanks very much for doing this interview. - Thank you. - I've been arrested. I've been put in jail. We tried to get an interview with people from your organization at the time. It just seems extraordinary. I can't do interviews with everybody, I wouldn't have enough time. You asked me to do it, and I just didn't have the time to do it. Now, your show, or your documentary got carried by BBC and others, so you've become a much more important person in terms of doing an interview. Now, are you going to do anything about all of these stories, this is just a small sampling, that rate it one of the greatestgolf courses in the world, that rate it... look. The world's two best courses. They're predicting the second course. It's a tremendous success. So successful that we're going to build a second course about five years earlier than we had anticipated. Mr. Trump, you've made legal threats against the BBC when they showed the filmand you said it was defamatory. Well, I thought it was, and I thought that your... ...the tone of it was so one-sided, and one of the reasons I've agreed to do the interview was that there was nobody to speak up for our side. You only asked negative questions, and you only speak to the two or three people that were opposed to it. You wouldn't let us speak to you. - The police wouldn't let us-- - Only, only... Well, the police you'll have to deal with. The police obviously had a good reason for doing to you - what they did. - You've been accused - of using the force-- - I never spoke to the police. The Grampian force, your own private security force. I never spoke to the police about you. Nobody from our side was asked for an opinion or gave an opinion. They were, Mr. Trump. But I'm sure it wouldn't have been put in. And I'm sure even my answers will be cut short and will be highly inaccurate. That's why I have a camera watching us, because I want that for, obviously, you know, for certain reasons. You've been accused of bullying the local people of the Menie Estate, - the local residents. - Really? I thought, "God, who... Trump people?" This is a little bit like your documentary, Anthony. You show scenes like that, and it's very hard to counteract a statement from such a woman. She actually reminds me a little bit of my mother, if you want to know the truth. She looks like a lovely woman. You pursued her for legal costs when she took out court action against you. You pursued an 86 year old pensioner for legal costs. How do you think that comes across, Mr. Trump, to people in Scotland? Let's put it a little bit differently. We pursued Michael Forbes, and Michael Forbes was not fair to us, was not nice to us. We see a scene of David Milne with this big bank of earth built next to his house. Yeah? It's very simple. Are you ready? It's very simple. And I'm sure you won't put on much of what I say, but that's okay. David Milne has a house that's not at all attractive. We're building a tremendously expensive, tremendously expensive development. - But it's his home. - I'm not touching his land. I'm touching my land, and this is one of the few times I've ever seen where putting up trees... As an example, we're putting up trees around Mr. Milne's house. Usually when you put up trees you get medals. I'm putting up trees and he criticizes it. With Milne, every time he speaks he speaks negatively about the project. So why should I be in love with him? His property is terribly maintained. It's slum-like, it's disgusting. He's got stuff thrown all over the place. He lives like a pig. I just wonder whether you regret those words at all. Well, I think the tone is harsh. I don't regret it, I think the tone is harsh. I think that he should fix up his property. Had that farm, or whatever it is, looked good, I would have a much different attitude toward beaming, or treeing, or doing all the other things, which frankly, - cost me a lot of money. - You've called Mr. Forbes an embarrassment for Scotland, yet he was voted Scotsman of the Year. Know how that happened? Because a group of people rang up the thing... I mean, give me a break, over Andy Murray, who won the U.S. Open. Tens of thousands of people voted, Mr. Trump. Excuse me, that was done. They had phone banks. That was done by people that tried to get him as an embarrassment. I think it's a joke. So you would dispute the tens of thousands of people who voted for Mr. Forbes? I don't think it's tens of thousands of people. I would dispute it. That was a campaign. That's what we've been told by the organizers. I'm sure the organizers say whatever they have to say, but that was a campaign to try and get him in there because they wanted to try and embarrass Trump. I'm sure the organizers say whatever they have to say, but that was a campaign to try and get him in there because they wanted to try and embarrass Trump. But that's just Trump, isn't it? You wouldn't expect anything else from him. I was really proud of him when he was voted Top Scot. I was a very proud woman. Yeah, really was. I said, "Well, I never thought my son would get Top Scot." The Trump organization has confirmed it's putting it's plans here on hold. His legal challenge to stop an offshore wind farm he branded ugly, has now been bunkered. There's even talk of the For Sale signs being put up. What we've lost was important to us. It was part of our natural heritage, it was an amazing natural wonder. And for what? Instead he will focus his energy and money on the newly acquired Doonbeg golf complex in Ireland. I'm gonna spend tremendous amounts of money. Everybody in the world must know what like he is now. So, poor Ireland. I hope they've been listening to all this. The fact that Donald Trump would visit with his family and endorse the investment and say he intends investing more. That's great news. There's an old ballad in Scotland called The Two Brothers, and the idea that they're playing innocently in the scrubland, which to me is both the dunes at Balmedie, and the mountain in Dubrovnik. And I think the whole idea of playing been misappropriated grossly by the Trump Corporation. Talk about playing golf. Playing is not having tens of thousands of pounds to spend on expensive equipment, to cosset yourself off from the rest of the world. That's not play, that's power. That's why we call it the commons, it's community and the commonwealth. Landscapes that connect us to our past, to our history, that provide context to our communities and that are the source ultimately of our values, and our virtues, and our character as a people. I've wasted eight years of my life. But it's been worth it. We knew he'd take off. Because that's what he does. And I'm very pleased that he's taking off now.
