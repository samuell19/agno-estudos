Trampled by the dark army of Fury and scorched by the dragon's breath The peace and harmony between the 12 kingdoms of Nazroth is little more than a distant memory. Emerging from the chaos and surrounded by the stench of death The Princess of Zaldah has survived the destruction of her castle. Armed with a powerful dragon egg snatched from the rubble of her castle And the knowledge that her brother is behind the army of fury bloods She must save her people There's a war coming. Giving her strength are her most loyal and courageous Royal Knights Joining forces with Katori Warrior Women to stop their common enemy Prince Favian from conquering the entire realm. Kingdoms will fall, crushed beneath the feet of a thousand and torched by unstoppable dragons. Out of the ashes a Kingdom will rise. H's amply Where is everyone? Stay behind me Princess Our blows only seem to slow them George. As do our Hades It's like they don't feel pain. Can weapons not harm them? They don't know their injuries. Take thew heads Then let us cut off their heads and be done with it. So that's how we kill them. Search the building for weapons. Drag the bodies into the barn, lock the door. How much more of that stuff are you going to put on me? It stinks. The more we apply the faster we'll heal. Would you prefer I stop? If you put it like that. Then enough of your moaning You have a healing touch Your Highness. And a good stitch. Thank you We need to get you out of those clothes. I mean, you shouldn't look like royalty. We'll attract unwanted attention. Yes. these clothes do seem less appropriate now than ever before. There'll be many desperate people on the road. Not just the My Anyone could be working with Prince Favian. There'll be a high price on your head Your Highness. I saw some clothes in the cottages, you should gel changed How did Favian even get these eggs. And what is he using them for? I don't know but I don't like it. - There is the power in [he eggs of dragons - No good ever came from using magic. And even having that thing near us is bad luck. It must have something to do with the fury bloods or maybe he's trying to raise a dragon army. That would make him incredibly powerful. No one has ever enslaved a dragon. No ones ever found a dragons egg before What d'you mean? The dragons are believed to live in the jagged mountains. Beyond the volcanoes and rivers of lava, they are impossible to cross by man and the mountains too treacherous to climb. And the seas either side are too perilous that no ship's captain will ever dare to navigate them. Well. we know Favian is commanding the fury and he seeks to wrest the throne from father. But how is he doing it'? There is another. one who is yet to reveal himself. There must be. Favian doesn’t have the knowledge or power to do this on his own. Or the courage What is that'? It came from the dragon that destroyed the castle Get some sleep, at first light we push to the Northern Castle. I'll take first watch. Wan! some company George? No, rest up old friend George. Dimia. Thank god we found ya You're the King's Knights You were at the Inn. Everyone we're safe You have to save us What happened'? Kettlage was overrun by [he restless dead These furies Killed so many of us. We lost our daughter. Please help us. Where are you headed? To the King's Western Castle if it pleases you ma'am. We'll be safe there. The King's army will protect us. What's wrong'? Please let us shelter within the safety of the walls Please you have to protect us. - Please, sirs. Don't leave us to die. - Please. please. have mercy. - We are honorable people - Enough. The castle has been destroyed. You'll find no refuge there. All this way for nothing. Lies. They don't want to help us. Nothing can bring down the castle walls not even these fury. What Sir George says is true The castle was overrun and completely destroyed You must come with us to the North Castle, that is the only way you will be safe. What could destroy the castle? Here It's come back for the egg. Then we give it what it wants I told you all that thing would bring us nothing but trouble. Good riddance Until it comes back again. They need lo wait here You need to see this Dimia, stay with the Princess. What's wrong'? Furies. as far as the eye can see and they're heading straight towards us. What are we to do? We're gonna die. We're all gonna die. Ooh. we've lost everything. I knew we shouldn't have gone this way, I told you! - Like we should have gone down to- - I am the townsman and you do as I say. Stop fighting. Stop fighting. What are we gonna do? What are we going to do'? We're out off, there's no my through There must be thousands of them. This was the Prince's plan all along. To surround us and finish off everyone who's not loyal to him. How do we get to the Northern Castle? We have to warn father. We need to protect the people of our kingdom. of all the kingdoms. Favian wants us to bow at his feet, we mustn’t let him win. Maybe we head back to Kalon D'you think we'll make it? Favian surely has the Kingdom surrounded by now. I just have this sick feeling that inside of me that we are not fighting with our Katori sisters to the final toll As do I. But what shame do we have? These are unbearable odds George We can't go back north. Now we can't go south. W-What now? East. To the coast and safety by the sea. No means in which to buy passage. Here. Take this Give this to the captain of the Kings Armada. Tell him to set sail for the Red Islands. And to take you there to safety. Tell him to remain there until he gets more orders. Just make sure that he takes the whole Armada from the land. - You're not going to come with us? - No! Our path leads into darkness. You'll be safer on the seas. Let me come with you I can help. I can become a Knight To become a Knight takes years of dedication and training. We began at childhood. You're a townsman, your responsibility is to these people. - But you take Katori with you. - I said no. It's. err. it's Bryce. it's Bryce isn't it'? Part of being a Knight is obeying orders even if those orders are disagreeable to you. What is the best way to get to the castle? We go through The Dark Kingdom. The Dark Kingdom is an evil place. No-one of sane mind has ventured into that land. H's the mos! direct mute The fury are closing in, we have no choice. But George... The Dark Kingdom... No-one has ever survived The Dark Kingdom. The air is thick with whispers, talk of overthrowing the King Ssssh. the very bricks of this castle listen for deceit. The bricks may Helen bu! so do I, there are changes coming. You speak of treason. You want us killed'? Your Majesty, you wished to hear the report. Your majesty? Forgive me Commander. My mind is with my wife, the Queen I fear she gets weaker by the day You were saying} We have not had word from the Western Castle. The messenger's um! we sen! has not returned and we fear for the Prince and Princess' safety. Their safely? But we sent a whole battalion there? What if George and his men weren't successful? What if the dragon has destroyed [he castle? What of my daughter'? What if... if... No need to worry Father. The Western Castle is safe and secure as am I and sister. Favian. What are you doing here? wanted lo be close to you and mother Where is the battalion. I do not need any battalion to hide behind Father. I would brave any danger to be at Mothers side. The battalion remains with the people at the castle. An old heart warms with your gallantry my son. But Favian... Where is Elizabeth? Do you believe all the stories of The Dark Kingdom? They're not just stories Your Highness. Those who have ventured in have never returned. Only their screams. M's true The Katori know of many souls lost to that place. What are these myths you tell of? Myths! Huh! The legend tells of a sorcery by the name of the Magister. And he descended into the deepest and darkest valley. Once he was there he used his powers to create such abhorrent abominations of creatures The strange mist fell on the land and for two hundred years the name 'The Dark Kingdom' has struck fear in the heart of the innocents. And yet. that is where we are headed. Bu! it can! be (me, can it? That is the stuff of nightmares. No-one knows, no-one living anyway Maul you to leach me how to fight if half the legends are true I'll need to be of better use. As you wish. Richard, swords Take the sword. Hold it like this. It has to become part of you, not something you hold. Let the weight move with you. not against you. Now draw it into your body and lean forward. Many attacker will charge you down. With the blade in this position. it'll surely find its mark. From here, you defend Good You ready? Good Use your body and footwork to avoid the News. Show me Attack Try. Good Sirens! Fish. Fishy Puh. Tuh.. Sc good There's been something I've been meaning to tell you. Goon The stable girl I talked of... Elizabeth and I we- I know. How long have you known'? I wasn't sure until we were in the castle two nights ago. It wasn't supposed to happen. A Knight and a Princess. that's why I kept it a secret. There'll be many that will disapprove. But not you my friend? No. But we have a treacherous road ahead, you must have a clear head. You weren't asleep last night, were you'? No. Always protecting me. even from myself. Always Sir. Always. Do you think the King suspects anything is amiss? It's possible My Lord. Possible? Instruct the Magister... To have our Furies ready To stand outside the castle gates We must ensure that my dear sister and her beloved Knights... Are finished. There is still no sign of her, nor of Sir George or Sir Richard. Wan! them found Tell the Magister to send Furies that have known them. Anyone turned that knows how these Knights think find And destroy them As you command My Lord What is it? Nothing. I hear no birds. No animals. No insects We're here The threshold of The Dark Kingdom. A place of no! day nor night I don't like it. None of us do Whatta we do now? Prepare yourselves, once we cross the boundary there'll be no turning back. Are you ready Knight? I could have died happy in the arms of that Siren. We move quickly and quietly. We mustn't attract any attention. What is it? Large Heavy Tracks are maybe two or three hours old. H's a Demon Mailers not. The tracks lead in the other direction. Let's go. The Kingdom is overrun with Fury Fury' those are just stones Ne. Ne, no, no they're real. They killed my daughter. And my husband M's true Our Village and the Western Castle have been destroyed. Where are the King's messengers? Likely killed. The Royal Knights, they told me to give you this. Please. You must help us. They said to set sail for The Red Islands. Captain? Whose blood is this? My husband's. He's just... he was just an Inn Keeper and he couldn't fight off these Fury. We has! everything We have our orders We make haste For The Red Islands What is it? We're being watched Take cover. Let': leave before that thing comes back What ms that? I do not know, nor do I care to know. Nor do I wish to find out what it was afraid of. That's what we all should be afraid of. This is magic Let's get out of this place. Search your rotten minds, seek out your old commander George. Find him and the Princess wherever they hide. Do not rest until they are dead. I can't believe Bryce left us. He's selfish, some townsman he is He has his own demons. I'll need you to come to the Captain and tell us why we are headed for The Red Islands and my we have you on board You must tell me about these Fury. - Look, we have run for our lives. - The Knights told us to come to you. To protect the people of Xaldah. We're on the brink and only our actions will ensure the future of our Kingdom. You wish to see me Father. It is customary to knock before you enter. Your messenger said it was urgent so no time to waste I prefer to stand and take in the room. Sit. There is something you are not telling me. As far as I am aware, the castle is intact. And why would the castle not he intact? Magic. I can smell it. Ssssssh. You hear that? Sounds like a rock slide. We have lo push forward Keep moving We're going to get crushed. Form up What good are our weapons going to be against that'? Stop it. You're just annoying it. Elizabeth. No. - He'll kill her. - Wait. Wan You're treading on my home Forgive us. We did not know Our land has been destroyed and we are trying to find safety. We mean you no harm. Drop your weapons Careful This mean place. Thank you for your kindness Kind-ness. Well that was weird. We were all ready to fight but all it took was a moment of softness from the Princess to stop it. Elizabeth. please never do that again. It's alright George. You can trust me. The story was of rocks moving with intent The rocks were actually alive. Maybe we should be more mindful of the interpretations of the legends. Yeah. Of course. Now. my friends. please can we get out of this place. His time is over. It is time I became King. What is it you would have me do My Lord? Find a way to get the Furies within the castle walls.
