Long live the king! Long live His Highness! Mercy, Your Highness Mercy, Your Highness! - Shut him up! Killed me! Save me, Your Highness! Killed me! General, why is the complainant being stopped from coming to me? It is against your pride to talk to every other man, Your Highness A king and his subject are like father and son Sher Khan, present the complainant before me Tell me. - We had no rains this year Searing drought prevails. Our children are starving. We're in a predicament Instead of waiving the tax, we're being burdened even more What am I hearing, general? I had ordered for the use of official treasure, and the foodgrain... in the storehouses to be distributed among the subjects. Execute the order Your order will not be executed. If all the foodgrain are distributed... the army will starve. If that happens, who will protect the nation? Commander, a piece of land doesn't make a country Citizens make a country. If they are dead, whom will the army protect? Your Highness, this is against administrative policy Swords, not emotions, run a monarchy. - And the army wields swords How dare you unsheathe the sword before me? What does this mean? Simple, Your Highness. When a Rajput unsheathes a sword... he draws it back only after quenching its thirst for blood No! No! This is no time to mourn Queen Mother. The assassin is on his way here... for the prince. He wants to ensure there's no successor to the throne My son! Kill the Queen and the prince. - No heir to the throne must live! Go Be brave. This is the time to save the only heir of the king Surround the palace. No one must escape Let's hide the prince inside the temple of Lord Ganesh over there In the temple? - Yes, Queen Mother. We're surrounded The successor to the throne must live. For God's sake, heed me. Come on In this basket Not to fear, Your Majesty. Allah will protect him Lord, we leave the prince to You. - Save my son, Lord Queen Mother, let's split. I will lead them away. We'll meet at the temple May Allah protect you Chief, the horse is abandoned. - Just one shot killed them both The prince and the Queen Hail Lord Ganesh Lord, grant me my wish A kid. - Kid...? Let me see A kid in a basket? - What a lovely boy Yes. There must be someone with him. Let's go out and check Whose kid is this? Anyone...? Quiet now! - Whose kid is this? Shut up now! Why are you yelling? Who is going to hear you in this forest? I've been praying all along. This kid is mine. The Lord gives me Hey... that's his mark. - Mark? Hold it dear, all right? Look... Queen Mother, the prince is not here. - What...? No... no! Where's my son, my baby? No! No! Give me back my son! Be brave, Queen Mother. Our prince isn't lost The Almighty has surely placed him under the care of a noble soul Look at the fresh flowers. Had our prince not been safe... we would've found this place stained in blood, not flowers Believe me. Some devotee has certainly visited this place and offered flowers He must've taken the baby with him. Trust me The Almighty cannot be so cruel. He is merciful and benevolent Pray, son Where did our chief ind the baby? - In the temple of Lord Ganesh The Lord has been kind to him. - Take a good look at him Recognise him. He's going to be our tribe's chief after me Long live the little chief! Jwala is here Tell my son's future, Santoni Arise, Jwala. Arise, unravel the mystery! Predict. Where does he come from? Why is he here? Suraj (Sun). Your son is Suraj. He will rule the world when he grows up But you will not live. You will not live to see that day So what? Every man has to die. But my son's future is bright Sire, the Queen and the prince are dead Long live, His Majesty Durjan Singh We, your faithful, have assembled here to proclaim that... we shall certainly avenge your martyrdom from the enemy Unless we ind the prince and restore the throne, we shall... iercely counter the atrocities done to the poor, under the Queen Mother So that the ires of rebellion burn forever in the hearts of the people We're rebels. Rebellion is our right. - Long live the rebellion! "Moti..." "never forget our friendship" "Never forget our friendship..." "my childhood chum, my elephant" "You could die for me" "You love me" "You scare everyone but you are scared of me" "You are crazy about me..." "so am I about you" "Never forget our friendship" "Together we shall play, together we shall live" "May not we ever part" "May we never part, may we never be lonely" "Even if that happens, may we never stop loving" "Never forget our friendship..." "my childhood chum, my elephant" That elephant will be good for the prince's rides. Catch it Why must you? This elephant belongs to me it's the king's order! Get it? - Nloti is mine I won't let anyone touch him. - Why won't you? Get out of the way! No! As long as I alive, no one will touch him All right, you won't live Baba! Vikram, look my son, there's an elephant for you to ride See Padma? An elephant for me. There's not even an ass for you Sher Khan... - Yes Your Majesty? When I saw that kid today... - Yes...? What state have I come to? I ind my son in every boy I had put my son under Your care. You must return him to me How long will You delay mercy, Lord? So many years have passed in the pining to see my son Where must my son be? What kind of justice is this, Lord? Even today, a sinner... is occupying the throne that ought to have been my son's Vikram... The king is no more. The sun has set in Suryagadh Should the sun set on one end... it rises on the other Hail king Vikram Singh Hail the Queen Mother What news do you bring from the city, Sher Khan? After Durjan Singh, his son Vikram Singh has succeeded him And instead of rejoicing, his subjects wallow in misery Son turns out to be ruthless than his father How have the subjects reacted? - The sword of tyranny silences them I wish, we could tell them that their Queen and their prince are still alive But where's the prince? Who will answer them if they ask? "Gypsies... we're gypsies" "Gypsies... we're gypsies" "We're one of a kind" "In hearts, we live" "We make merry among ourselves" "Like the river, we flow" "Gypsies" "We're gypsies" "We're one of a kind" "The world laughs over us" "We laugh over the world" "Today here, there tomorrow, we pitch in wherever we wish" "We exchange hearts for hearts, we live and die for love" "We're lovers..." "we're lovers, we're Iovestruck" "Gypsies..." "we're gypsies..." "We're one of a kind" "We use our hands to work, we use words to entertain" "Rainy days, we fear..." "but not along night of love" "We aren't mean friends" "Flowers, we cherish" "Thorns..." "even thorns we accept" "Gypsies..." "we're gypsies" Attention! Princess Padmavati's royal carriage is on its way Clear the village square Why are you running off? - The princess is coming this way! Run, if you want to live. - What if I wish to see the princess? Your eyes will be gouged out! Amar, come on! You want to die? - No, I want to see the princess Come on! Closed buggy...? Her Majesty is inside the buggy I thought you were ugly, that's why you prefer to stay inside the buggy But you are so pretty. - Anybody there? Arrest him! It's so crowded here. I'll come to meet you in private Insolence! Who is this man? Easy...! - They've been ruthless Why did you have to go there? - Shallo... how many marks on my back? - Many The whip marks on my body shows how much she loves me Loves...? Who? The princess? - Who else? You? Stay in your limits. Her brother, Vikram Singh, is a tyrant If you try to meet her, he'll slit your throat If the swine cuts my throats, the princess will kill herself my for sake As if you are married to her! - Almost. I have chosen her She's going to choose me now, and then we'll be married bylaw If you go there tomorrow, your heart will bear as many wounds as your back She's burning in envy, and she's trying to burn me Stay in your limits, son. Why must you take on the royals? Who's taking them on, Ma? Her men flagged me. In fact... they've challenged your tiger, Ma And what a wounded tiger does, I must show Her Majesty Why must you stake your life for him, Shallo? Sarju! I'm marrying Amar. You get it? - But he isn't marrying you Someday he's going to dump you. Then you'll come to me. So why not today? I'd rather drown myself! - Only if I let you die I'll take you away by force! - Let go of my hand! Don't you dare, Sarju! You ought to be ashamed Ashamed? What for? I'm proposing marriage You know the rules of our clan. No marrying a girl against her wishes One is also allowed to talk to spinsters. Stop me after you marry her Whether I marry her or not, but till such time as I am the chief... I won't let anyone force a girl. Shallo, go away "Look at her..." "setting water on ire" Who's there? "Covering her body..." "the fair lady is taking a bath" How dare you? Uncouth man! Don't you know who I am? "Are you a celestial beauty?" "Or, are you someone else?" "You aren't woman" "You are a silken thread" Fool! You think I'm thread? Moron! You have invited your death! - Death...? So beautiful? I could die for such a snakebite "You're a serpent" "And I'm snake-charmer in love" "I shall lure you away..." "and leave the world gaping" You aren't getting away alive out of the palace! "Guard yourself as much as you can" "Cover yourself as much as you can" "But don't be so vain" "Don't deny this poor heart" "My heart is no less than a palace..." "for, in my heart you dwell" "You're a serpent" "And I'm snake-charmer in love" "I shall lure you away..." "and leave the world gaping" You'll die a horrible death! - "Those in love..." "don't fear death" "For your lovely countenance..." "a thousand moons could die" "Your disheveled tresses..." "could plunge the world into darkness" "You're a serpent" "And I'm snake-charmer in love" "I shall lure you away..." "and leave the world gaping" "if not today, tomorrow it will be" "Let's bet on it" "Love will cast its spell on you..." "and you will dance in joy" "For a smile on your lips..." "I'd drink your venom" "You're a serpent" "And I'm snake-charmer in love" "I shall lure you away..." "and leave the world gaping" Disperse! it's such a lovely moment. Her Majesty hates this intrusion You'll be punished for this intrusion. - Did you hear? You'll be punished! What are you waiting for? Arrest him! - What are you waiting for? Arrest me Didn't hear? She wants me arrested. She wants me to stay here What...? - You've fallen in love at irst sight I must return. Now that I have chosen a pretty bride for myself... I want to break the good news to Ma. - Insolent! Thank you Excuse me... my headdress is with you. Take care of it, I'll return for it Kill him! He escaped? How could he? Tell the soldiers... if they want to live, they must bring him to me, dead or alive Alive, if possible Why bother the soldiers, Your Highness? He'll come on his own He promised to come here, and he came. He'll come again for the headdress He's a man of his word. - Shut up! My hot babe, out of my way. - To hell with your hot-babe! Did you meet the princess? Are you satisied? Of course, satisied. And I'm frozen. - Why? Does she have four eyes? Four hands? Four legs? Four ears? - She has four hearts What...? - Yes. One heart says... Amar, don't leave me The second says, Amar, embrace me Third says... - Stop it! Your brain is rusted What has she got that I haven't? Is she diamond-eyed? Silken-haired? Do flowers rain when she speaks? - Yes. Roses She smells like sandalwood. Today we even bathed together You bathed with her? - Yes, in the royal pool Take a whiff. You'll smell sandalwood. - Don't touch me. You've bathed... with someone else. You're stained. Unless you bathe in the Ganges... the stink won't leave your body. - I won't ever bathe. Never Lest this lovely fragrance leaves me. - It appears, you're off your wits Come on, drop me home. - No, you aren't sitting... on my horse any more. Only she will sit. I'll ride only with her You will marry only me. I'm going to mother your kids. You get that? I have no plans to become father now. Lay off Goodness! Lord, what am I to do? Wasn't he so ine a while ago? Princess, our army is amazing. A man teased you at the pool... and they picked up twenty men. Go and identify the lover... I mean, the rogue it's none of them Her Majesty says the offender is not among them Let them go. - Let them go. By order Wait! Those who are arrested and brought to me, don't return without a punishment But brother, they are guiltless. Why must you punish them? One must fear the curse of the poor. - Swords run a monarchy! Otherwise, a monarchy loses the power it wields So these are the ones who dared to enter our pool! It's a lie, Your Highness. We are innocent. Your soldiers... brought us here by force - You mean, my soldiers... cannot differentiate between the guilty and innocent? I trust my army You trust your army but not your subjects? This is unfair, Your Majesty You suspect my justice? - No, Your Highness We're merely voicing our anger against the army The voice reeks of rebellion. Soldier, silence the voice Mercy, Your Highness. Mercy! Has anyone else to question my justice? Take them away. Throw them in the dungeons So that their spiteful eyes pine to see the sun Come on Where are they from? - Village Gangapur, Your Highness Uncivil men. Gangapur will not be my territory any more. Execute the order She's stranded. Get her. Go Son, were it not for you he'd have shot me. You have given me... a new lease of life. Who are you? - I'm Amar, the gypsy... Well, I'm no prince that you'll know. - You're very brave You're very brave, Ma-ji. You were great with the sword May I say something, Ma-ji? - Tell me, son I don't why I feel like touching your feet We need brave men like you. Join us Please don't mind... what do you do? - We're rebels Rebels...? Good Lord! That demands bloodshed. You must be killing many What we gypsies do is just sing and dance. Keep this, it might hurt Goodbye, Ma-ji. - Bless you, son One bandit, a woman, defeats such a huge kingdom And all of you have come to me alive with this news? I feel like skinning you alive and hanging you at the square But then, warriors should not be humiliated before the subjects Commander, let my favourite elephant trample all these brave men At least they will die respectfully. Execute the order Past, present, future... manifest! - Bibi Amma... What is it? - My lover doesn't talk to me any more He has forgotten his childhood love ever since he has met the princess When will he marry me? - Marry? Abracadabra! This girl loves someone. He is indifferent. Tell me the consequence Showers of blood... ires... destruction... nothing will be spared Nothing will exist... no throne, no crown What will happen to my love? - Will be decided on a full-moon night Go and wait for the full moon. Go away! Pining, I'm restless every moment During the day I dream about my love, and at nights I can't sleep Lady, I'm here How could you enter the palace? - I came flying, counting on my love Insolent! You came again? I will clip your wings! And hold them close to your heart. - I'll ix you rightaway Before you call someone in, won't you accept your birthday gift? Your lover has come to meet you. And I bring you a pair of rabbits Don't be surprised. Learn from them the only thing that they teach Make love and have kids Take care Go ahead, summon anyone Arrest this savage! Quick! Will you use arrows and swords to kill a lover? Kill me with love Catch me if you can I hate a crowd. I'll meet you in private. Pretty soon Arrest him and present him before me What happened? Has he been caught? - No, none could catch him He jumped the wall and ran away. - Ran away? Useless! All of you I don't need anyone. Go away. - Me too? Yes, you too Useless! Everyone! Thank you for this lovely gift, Your Highness You...? How dare you lie on my bed? You mind? In this very bed we shall have our nuptials someday Not a bed for nuptials, it's your deathbed Not dagger, nor sword can harm me. My arms have taken all It seems you don't love your life. - You are my life How will I survive without loving you? - Only if you live A human can kill another, Your Majesty. But to kill love is beyond human hands It is love that gave me the courage to come here and return alive everytime Like a thief you entered and left. And you think you've been courageous? Don't challenge a lover's courage! If I wish I can take you away now But I won't. On full-moon nights you visit the temple on the hill, I hear Make sure you come with the entire Red Army. I'll come alone If I whisk you away from amidst all the soldiers, then you will have to... shed your false pride and embrace this gypsy. Agree? Only if your head remains. - Not you, the high of royalty speaks For a while forget that you are a princess, and look into your heart You'll ind me in some corner. And... you must give in to your heart No, I won't return this. My foster-sister is marrying today I'll tell her that her sister-in-law has sent this gift for her My headdress is lucky, I'm not. Look how majestically it lies on your seat Take care of this weapon. You may need it on the full-moon night. Bye Look into your heart. You will ind me in some corner. And... you must give in to your heart You threw the headdress away, but how will you get over his memories? Memories? Of the tumbler? - All right he is a tumbler But his jumps have set your heart somersaulting Well, my hot babe looks frozen today Today it will be decided! - Has the war begun? Yes, the war has begun! I'll kill you or I'll kill myself You're coming from there, aren't you? - Shallo, I can't help it I don't go there, my legs take me And now, even the princess' condition is like mine. She's pining She wasn't willing to let me go today. - Then why did you return? You could've stayed back? - Can't digest the food... when it comes on a golden platter. Until I eat the food you cook... I'm not sated. After I marry the princess, make sure... you teach her to make bread. - Must you rub salts into my wounds? If you want to marry that cursed woman then take this and pierce my heart What's wrong with you? You think I'll thrust this knife into you? I don't want your sympathies Does she love you more than I do? - Yes... she loves me... dearly She calls me "My Romeo" these days Swear it on me No Shallo, I can't swear falsely on you Amar! I knew you can't swear falsely on me. You love me You won't even stab me! You want to tease me that's why you take her name But I'm not buying that! - Don't dream unrealistic dreams Say whatever you want to, I'll get even with you after marriage She's hurting herself Stop Bravo! Now you are capable of taking on the enemy What you have learnt, teach that to the neighbouring villagers Let them teach others. Finally every village will become a fortress... and every young man, a warrior Princess, are you going to the temple tomorrow with the soldiers? What is it about tomorrow? - The gypsy. The one who promises... to come, comes, goes back and returns again What do you think? Will he come? Doesn't he hold his life dear? The text of Love says that true lovers don't hesitate to give their lives Basanti, talking about love and sacriicing life for love... are two different things. He isn't coming My darling Raja, know why I am decking you up tonight? Get the plan very clear. Today the princess is going to ride on you Don't mess it up, else I'll whack you. Let's go He's not to be seen. - Who? The one who always promises to come. - He isn't coming. Poor Life is dear So the Love texts lie that true lovers don't hesitate to give their lives It is true! He is here! It's a dummy. - That's a dummy! The cheat! Coward! See? Talking about love and sacriicing for love... are two different things. - Here! My life is for you, princess Gypsies are true to their word. Those foolish soldiers can't kill me If you wanted to kill me, you should've brought in cannons Not like a thief, I'll take you away amidst flying arrows How will you ride? On elephant? Or horseback? Horseback will be the best! Raja! Take the girl! Halt! No one tries to step forward! Inform your king that... Her Majesty has gone to see her in-laws Faster! Jump, Raja! Don't worry, Your Majesty, your soldiers are sluggish Amar...? Insolent man! You'll know when I get you hanged! Hang me after the wedding, I won't mind. But you must marry me With the princess...? Stop, Amar! - Shallo, out of the way! Where are you taking that witch? Stop! - We're marrying today Summon the priest, pronto. - Stop, Amar! No! Stop, Amar! - Her Majesty wants sweet distributed I'll kill her! Stop! Stop, Raja. Our castle is here Well Your Majesty, you like the place? Come on, darling What grace! The gypsy girl is no better than you And why not? A gypsy's company does show its effect Raja, did you enjoy taking the princess on a ride? And why not? Both of us enjoyed Well, do you commend my act of bravery? You kidnapped a girl using deception, and you call that an act of bravery? If not an act of bravery, it is a tactic in love This battle of war between you and me has made me Iovesick, Your Majesty And only wedding can cure me. So tell me, do you like the bridegroom? Do you intend to taint a girl in this desolate ruins? What a shame! This doesn't speak well of you, princess You consider my love a slur on you? You ought to be proud of my love I stole you away from amidst soldiers risking my life. Didn't you see? I had promised you. Remember? I have fulilled my promise Now fulill your promise and embrace me You dare to speak such things because I'm in your custody Who is in whose custody? You or I? I'm in your custody at the moment. Entrapped in the shackles of your love I swear by you, I love the shackles Still, if you think my love for you is a crime, I'm willing to be punished Punishment? I wish I had a sword. Your head would've been at my feet Is that all you wish? I'm in love with you, so I shall give you every wish of yours My life isn't dearer to me than your love, Your Majesty Here you are Have your wish Shoot the arrow. Go on Go on, shoot! What are waiting for? Curse my mother's milk if I waver one bit Shoot! You can't shoot, princess Not the worst of your rage can diminish my love Those lovely eyes, fluttering lips, those shivering arms... all prove that your heart has begun rebelling for me If not me, you must listen to your rebelling heart Shoot, or embrace me Shoot, or embrace me! - Insolent! Blood gypsy! Now that you have shot the arrow, you have made me aware of where I stand A speck of dirt that tried to reach for the stars has got its punishment That a princess would love a gypsy was just a misconception I had Thank you for making me aware of my status Raja, drop the princess safely at the palace Please... What are you looking at? Not a wound, it is my love's grave... in which I have buried all my desires and dreams Go on, princess. No gypsy will ever come in your way again "My beauty..." "made me arrogant" "Your love..." "shattered..." "that image" "With the world and its people..." "today I revolt..." "now that I have fallen in love with you" "I'm in love with you" "ls today the day ofjudgement?" "Such mercy you show towards me" "You have fallen in love with me" "You are a princess, you reside in a castle" "I'm 893/P53/1 a rustic" "My crown..." "I lay at your feet, I'm crazed" "Those who weigh feelings with wealth..." "are merchants who trade in hearts" "I'm in love with you" "I have forgotten all the norms..." "everything I accept" "I never knew, desires..." "turn one impulsive" "I have fallen in love with you" "Make me or break me..." "I'm a caged bird, do what you want to me, O'hunter" "My disheveled tresses, my fluttering veil..." "invite you..." "now that I have fallen in love with you" "With the world, with the people..." "today we revolt" "I'm in love with you" "I'm in love with you" Brother, I'm guilty. I ought to be punished. You have no right... to take an innocent's life. - I'm not here to demand my right I only want to make you aware that your place is in the palace... not among the gypsies. You will not step out of the palace any more Which means I am under house arrest? - No. I'm just guarding royal honour Brother, you can conine my body, but you can't shackle my soul A princess trying to defend a gypsy? Don't you care for your royal status? For me to shun my pride, the ordinary gypsy ought to have something in him Which is why he will be beheaded and his head presented to you To prevent a princess trade the royal status... we earned by the edge of the sword Take the princess away safely Shallo...? - You recognise me? You lured Amar and got him arrested. Are you satisied now? Who is satisied and who is burning, how would you know, Shallo? Love knows not deceit. - Love? How'd a rich princess know? Love is heart's treasure. And a heart, we poor posses You have destroyed my love. I shall have your blood Were my death to save Amar's life I'd love to die Shallo, if you really love Amar, forget me and save his life Take me out of this place. We must get to the dungeon and save Amar Another deceit, another ploy. - Don't call pining a ploy, Shallo Pining in your heart? Ask the heart which pines for Amar since childhood Amar's voice resonates in every heartbeat. I'm only a sculpture Amar is my soul. - Then help me save the soul Shallo, if we are late, in this battle, Time will defeat Love Whose love do you mean? Yours? Or mine? Shallo, this is no time to argue but to save Amar He must live, no matter if he becomes yours... but help me, Shallo If this be deceit, I'm willing to accept this beautiful deceit But on one condition After Amar is released he will belong to me, not to you To save Amar's life, I accept any condition Then come on Open Your command, Your Majesty? - Open the gate I can open it only on official order isn't a princess' order not official? - I'm helpless, Your Majesty Hand over the prisoner to me. It's an order Every prisoner is under the king's custody. I'd rather lose my life... than betray. - Then you'll lose your life! Your Majesty, don't compel me to use force Shallo, pick up the keys. - Don't allow her! Shallo, quick! Move! Take this! Get out of here, quick! - Come on Don't let them escape! Do as I say. The two of you get out of here And you? - Not wise for all of us to go at once I'll go this way Your Highness, the gypsy has escaped Someone is coming. Go on, I'll see Did you catch the girl, too? - No. She was shot, yet she escaped Shallo? - Shallo, my child! I regret, those wrists that once wore golden bangles wear iron handcuffs now I'm not responsible but your wrong step that maligned royal reputation To each his own thoughts. You think I maligned the royal reputation But I think I have honoured love Now that I've freed Amar from your shackles, I care not for handcuffs Nlisconception? it's your misconception that Amar is free None escapes Death. Likewise, no prey escapes king Vikram's Singh's custody Amar is still my prisoner. And tomorrow morning... you will witness the bloody scene when he will be done to death Death...? - Yes, death. Tell me... if you have a greater punishment on your mind, I'll consider it Half a glass? Fill it! I'm the chief now Not yet, boss. Yes, you will become the chief after Amar's death Not so long before he dies Don't you know? No prey has ever escaped king Vikram Singh's trap And the slut went to save him! - Boss, Shallo will be yours now If not me, who else will the slut belong to? My Amar's life is in danger. Save him Bibi Amma, I beg of you No use begging to me. Look up, the Goddess needs blood, a sacriice Then offer me. Let my blood quench the Goddess' thirst. Save my Amar No one can save him. No one can save him from the Goddess' wrath Love can save him. My love can take on any tempest Don't take on this tempest, you will lose your life I'll give it! I'll sing, dance and I shall earn the Goddess' favour Don't! Don't do it, Shallo. This is a harsh test. Not only your life... you will have to sacriice your love too "Tonight I shall give away my love..." "and also give a test" "Not only the heart..." "I can give my life too" "I shall sacriice my life for this crazy heart of mine" "I shall sing and dance till my dancing-bells shatter" "I have been deceived" "Don't stop me tonight" "The tears I shed didn't work for me" "I have lamented enough" "Tonight I shall bare my heart..." "to show my wounds" "I shall sing and dance until my dancing-bells shatter" "My luck doesn't favour me" "it's beyond my control" "No matter how weak women are..." "but we aren't cowards" "Alone I shall take on the world" "I shall sing and dance until my dancing-bells shatter" General, pronounce his crime The accused Amar is the gypsy chief Not only did he dare to sneak into the palace on the sly... he also committed the crime of entering into the princess' rest-room But for the merciful Her Majesty, her guards would've beheaded him Her Majesty ordered him to be detained for sometime But this ingrate took undue advantage of her leniency and tried... to escape from the prison with the help of some accomplices But our guards risked their lives and foiled his attempt Has the princess proposed another punishment? Yes She wants this ingrate to be trampled under an elephant in public Princess Padmavati's justice makes me happy But before her order is executed, according to the kingdom's law... ask the criminal his last wish Speak, if you have any last wish If you boast of giving me my last wish, then hear... I want to see the brave and pretty face... that helped me escape. - Impossible Gypsy, know your status! - Where does a great king stand... who can't fulill a small promise? - lnsolence! Behave yourself! Don't you fear Death? - Death, I embraced... the day I desired her love, whom you have bound in shackles The moment you breathe your last, the shackles will break by themselves Thanks for the comprehension. But you can't see the tears of a helpless soul The tears will rejoice after you die. - You are mistaken, Your Highness You don't know, those tears of love will turn into a tempest someday It will wash away the kingdom of an arrogant and heartless king like you No more shall the crown and throne be The rule, the false grandeur will be destroyed None of you shall live, Your Highness. But love will forever live! Trample him! Trample his head No! Moti...? it's you! It's me it's me. Your buddy. Remember me? Don't let him escape! After him! I want him. Dead or alive! Your Majesty... Amar escaped Amar is safe How could he escape? - A group of wild elephants... blocked our path, Your Highness General, this means our animals are smarter than our army But where will he go?

If Amar is not found, the princess will die What happened to the princess? - As soon as the elephant... raised its leg to trample Amar, Her Majesty fainted Perhaps, it still plays deep inside her mind It seems as if she'll die for Amar God forbid such love. - Will you take me to the princess? How can I take you inside the palace? - I'll show you the way. Follow me Allah is great Basanti, where have you been? How could you leave the princess behind? From a mendicant outside the city I have brought some holy incense Who is that with you? - She serves the mendicant She wants to see the princess once.

And to drive it out... alas, alas! - Can someone exorcise? Only one man can drive it out. - Who? The great seer Then get him over. - From where, Sire? It's been ages since I met him. He's an ascetic, a nomad Spends his day here, night there Can there be a way out to ind him? - There is one way out Set the drums beating.

She has lost her senses Not spirits, she's possessed by your love There's only way she can be saved. - How? She must see you. All the seers can't do what a lover's sight can Shallo, does that come from you? - You were the one who said... those in love give their lives, they don't take lives Come to your senses, my child Who are you reasoning with? The poor thing isn't herself Padma, my child... - Padma, where are you going? Open the door, Padma Open the door Open the door, Your Majesty. Open up, Padma Allah!

Kill me if you want to You put on a farce to deceive me. You ought to be ashamed. Step aside! I don't miss my targets. He must've died Until you cremate your enemy's corpse, consider him alive, elders say Time demands that the princess should be married off at the soonest Ask the priest to take the proposal today itself So that when the need arrives, we can take their help too Help! Please stop! What's wrong? - Help us. My Amar is injured The king shot him Sher Khan, he's the valiant one who saved my life. Pick him up Nothing serious, Queen Mother Look, Queen Mother Thank Allah for saving you. - I must thank you for saving me May I ask you something, son? Where did you End the armlet? My Ma gave it to me. - Your mother? Yes, I considered her my Ma Considered? You mean...? She wasn't my mother, but she meant more than a mother to me She reared me, loved me deeply She also told me that someone had left me at the temple of Lord Ganesh She had picked me up. That armlet was tied to my arm at that time Right. She was right. She wasn't your mother How do you know? - Because I'm the unfortunate mother You...? - Yes You abandoned me in the temple? Why? When a mother abandons her baby, not even God can fathom her grief it's a long tale, prince. - What...? Prince? Yes son, you are a prince I'm a prince...? What are you saying? I lived just to have a glimpse of you For once, call me Ma Call me Ma, son. Just once Ma Once again One more time Ma... - My son, Amar Long live prince Amar Singh! Prince, my job is over To protect the truth, justice and the subjects... today I hand over the royal sword to you Prince Amar Singh, from this day we consider you our king We, your subjects, anoint you with our blood King Amar Singh... - long may you reign Long live king Amar Singh Today you have anointed me with blood in place of saffron... and made me not a king, but you have shackled me with love... and made me your slave. I promise, for the blood I'm anointed with... I shall shed every drop of my blood to repay it I declare rebellion! Hail Goddess Bhavani! Hail Goddess Bhavani! Rebellion...? - Rebellion! Rebellion! My respected Father's statue was broken today The flag of rebellion was hoisted not at the village square but in my heart My commander, my general, governor, vizier and my army... everyone blindly stood watching me being humiliated And also kept assuring me that the Queen and the prince were dead And today the dead come alive? How come? How? Sire, don't the dead stand in for their progeny? Is he an impostor? Not Moon nor Sun makes a dawn. In any other name, the enemy, is but an enemy Before this rebellion rises like a storm, quell it Send the armies to every corner, shoot every suspect Let the voice of rebellion be buried in the twang of gunshots Speak! Where is your Queen? - I know nothing Where is the prince? - I know nothing Speak! - I know nothing Bloody rebel! Tell me the whereabouts of the prince, or your head will roll I'm not a rebel. Believe me. - You've gotten used to lying! Where is the prince? - I don't know All your men couldn't ind the hiding place of the rebels How will I face the king? - Can't help it, general The people are with them. Not even flaying them has opened their mouths What your power couldn't do till now, I must use my brains to do it Do what I have told you to do. - Yes sir No blunders My message should be sent to the Diwan of Rajgadh today itself We need his help. - Right sir Long live the prince. Long live the Queen Old man... - Let go! Where have you hidden the Queen and the prince? Else, your sons will be killed right before you Destroy us. Kill us. We're rebels! We won't tell you the whereabouts... of the Queen and the prince. We won't tell you We won't tell you. Kill me, but I won't tell you Speak. Else, I'll kill you. - Go on, kill me But remember, the death of a rebel breathes life into the cause Kill me. Long live the prince. Long live the Queen Then die! Bless you, warrior. Great is your courage You are great, sir. I salute your patriotism Does the princess know that you are a prince in rebellion? I don't know You haven't informed her? - No Have you forgotten her? She has loved you, and... - Shallo, it's the time of war Not the time to chant love Amar, love is her life. How is she at fault if you have turned a prince... from a gypsy? Has she wronged you? - No Then why have you changed so? - Shallo look there... look at the Queen Mother. An atrocious brute murdered her husband... snatched away the throne from her and made a beggar out of a Queen And for years, quelling the ire of vengeance in her heart, she waited... for the day when her son would grow up and avenge every atrocity... that was committed on her, regain the lost throne... and turn her into a Queen again And now that her dream is about to come true... should I tell her that I'm in love with the enemy's daughter? That, at this crucial juncture, I can't choose between love and war? Just imagine the predicament she will be in And what about the expectations my father's soul has of me? Think only about it, Shallo. Forget everything else Your Majesty! Know who the rebelling prince is? Who...? - Your Amar Amar...? - Yes, Shallo told me They shot two of sons right in front of me! Dragging us through the forest, they were taking us to their commander... when your men reached there. - Had we not reached in time, this... poor man's two other sons would've been shot to death, Queen Mother But I'm not grieving, Queen Mother. Even if a hundred sons of mine... were to sacriice for your sake, I'd still consider myself blessed I'm proud of your patriotism. Sher Khan, arrange for his treatment Hail the Queen Mother. - What news? Rajgadh's army has marched off to aid Vikram Singh Marched off...? - When will the army reach here? By night tomorrow. - Then we must attack the fort... before they arrive. - So soon? Yes Shallo, at this juncture the enemy is weak. Half its troops... are spread among the villages. We must set forth tonight itself... so that before the enemy awakes, our cannons would mark our arrival I agree with Amar Singh. One who attacks irst wins the war I've got to know, brother. The throne you sit upon was snatched And now the rightful heir has come forth Our Father had murdered. Humanity demands that we wash away the taint And hand over the kingdom to the rightful heir A kingdom is no plaything that can be gifted lovingly Crowns are wrested, and might is used to preserve them And I shall do it till my last breath. - The people can't take it lying down They seek an answer. If they don't ind an answer, they rebel Men confront a rebellion. Women must stay quiet and watch the fun Women don't only watch the fun. If the need be, they wield swords too Turn the pages of history, brother. - Brave men don't read history They write new history by the edge of the sword May Goddess Bhavani protect you, my son. Return victorious Allah willing, Queen Mother, we shall annihilate the enemy and return... with the royal carriage tomorrow, and take you to the palace... with great pomp and splendour. Amen Hail Goddess Bhavani! - Hail Goddess Bhavani! They have left, general. - Yes. Are the horses ready? Yes sir. Behind the hill Deathly silence. The enemy is sleeping unawares Behind the gate, the throne awaits you Uncle Khan, get the cannons at the front I shall lead the charge. Uncle Khan, you will attack from the right And you will stay here with your forces and attack the fleeing enemies Right. - Shallo, if something untoward... happens to me in this battle... I leave my Mother in your hands Take care of her as a son would Nawaz Khan... - Yes sir? As soon as we charge, blow up the gates Hail Goddess Bhavani! - Hail Goddess Bhavani! Did you think I was having a good sleep? Uneasy rests the head that wears the Crown Fool! You think you can incite these handful of peasants, give them toys... and get them to face cannons? - Not cannons, resolves win battles And resolves of my men run higher than the walls you defend Even ants aim higher, but they can't harm mountain If I wish, I can slaughter you and your men right now But I don't want to punish those poor men for your trespasses So I give you one chance. Surrender, and I shall spare their lives We are prepared to die, Vikram Singh. My soldiers aren't mercenaries... the men whom your tyranny has turned into rebels Your father assassinated the king and usurped the throne And we're sworn to wrest it back Halt! Won't you pay obeisances to the Queen Mother? She is perched on the throne that is truly hers Look Step forward, and your mother will be blown to pieces I give you my word. If you surrender, I shall forgive your men What keeps you, Amar? This is no time to ponder Step forward and snatch the right that your father was deprived of Right now it is your only duty Don't waste my time, gypsy If you don't surrender your arms, at the fourth stroke of the drum... the cannon will be ired. Light the match Wait! I accept your every condition if you will release the Queen Mother... in exchange for me. - No Amar! Don't think about me Do your duty as a warrior. This kingdom is yours. Seize it No Ma, not for all the riches in the world will I give up my Mother Amar, don't forsake your duty just for the sake of one relationship Unto duty you are beholden. Duty is God If duty is God, I hold my Mother dear Vikram Singh, untie her I surrender Done I kept my word, Vikram Singh. Fulill your promise. Release my Mother Fool, you can only lead the stupid gypsies. How would you understand... the intricacies of politics? In politics, promises are never fulilled Vikram Singh, you are one step ahead of your father in treachery I don't regard my vanquished enemy's words as abuse All I want to know is if the son will see his mother die irst? Or the mother will her son die irst? Decide fast. Death is catching up on you In the face of courage, at times even Death steps aside, Vikram Singh Amar has been deceived! - Blow up the gate! Fire the cannon Cannoneer, ire Save the Queen Mother, quick Let me see who saves you from the cannon Princess, you're helping the enemy? - I'm in the side of justice Arrest her! - Who dares? Bloody old fraud! I'll see the end of you! No! Oh, what have you done? I have given to you what is yours, Your Majesty His Highness Amar Singh... - long may he reign This victory is not mine, I owe it to all my subjects No Your Highness, justice wins! - Truth wins Victory of humanity! May the truth prevail! Let humanity prevail! May justice triumph!
