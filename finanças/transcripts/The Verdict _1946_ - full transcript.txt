THE VERDICT NEWGATE PRISON. LONDON 1890 May God have mercy on his soul. - Good morning, Supt. Grodman. - Good morning. Leaving so soon? It no longer delays. Would you want to see a man die knowing that you doomed him? He has what he deserves. He was found guilty of murder. Guilty, no doubt. ...grows and is cut like a flower... Escape from a world of shadows... In life we ​​are dead. Who can we turn to but you, Lord? It was a difficult case, but you handled it successfully. This profession is full of contradictions. For those who build a ship or compose a symphony,... ...success is sweet. For us, success is the lives we take. Success is very bitter. - But... - It's nothing personal. We are instruments of justice, like the court. The black flag. Everything is over. May his soul rest in peace. - Good morning, Superintendent. - Good morning. Sir, your assistant has been looking for you. Gracias. Good morning, sir, where have you been? If you allow me. I followed the impulse to walk in the park... - What is the urgency? - The Commissioner is expecting you. - Sir William? -In his office with Buckley. What is it about? I think Buckley is up to his tricks. He doesn't fit in his pants anymore... but he'll have a hard time filling mine. Good morning, Sir William. - Good morning, Mr. Buckley. - Good morning, Governor. I have something that will surprise you. He sent an innocent man to the gallows this morning. Crap. I suppose some madman wants to attract attention by confessing. He made a terrible mistake. Harris was found guilty of killing Hannah. The evidence was only circumstantial. I investigated the case very carefully. Harris was an ex-convict. Hannah hired him as a gardener. When she fired him, he threatened her. His nephew, whom I know, heard the threat. She called the police, and the next day they found her with her throat cut. His defense was false. The jury did not waver. The mistake was that he never presented the witness. The priest who could vouch that he was with him that night. About the priest who traveled to Wales the next day... ...obviously it was a lie. He didn't even remember her name. And he did not have the imagination to invent one. However, we inquired about the priest in Wales,... ...and it didn't show up. There never was such a cure. Such a cure exists. - What happened Mr. Holbrock. - Yes sir. pass Mr. Holbrock, Superintendent Grodman. Mr. Holbrock is in the parish of Kent. Yes, I know him. - Please sit down. - Thank you. Just got back from Wales? From New South Wales, in Australia... ...this morning. New South Wales. I heard about Harris from the press and came right over. I'm sure Harris thought New South Wales was in Wales. Were you with Harris the whole time? That night we packed up books to send to my sister. She is missionary. Did you know Harris? No. He stopped me on the street. He wanted to know how much a dinner would cost. I needed help and his presence was timely. I see. How are you sure it was the night of the murder? The night of July 21? I left London at 8am on the 22nd of July. I can't forget it, as I traveled to New South Wales that night. He took my luggage to the station. There we stopped him. At Waterloo. We thought he was lying. He insisted that you had traveled to Wales. There are no trains to Wales from there . I am very shocked. I feel like I'm guilty. I want you to know that I imagine what you must feel. - I can retire? - Sure, Mr. Holbrock. If we need it, we'll let you know. Welsh. New South Wales. Knows? It occurred to me that Harris might be confused. If it occurred to you, why didn't you say so? He had no certainty, just an instinct. But it was about saving the life of an innocent. Don't try to blame me. It seems to think that I want to replace it. You have justified that idea. - Gentlemen, please. - He makes a serious accusation. The fact is that an innocent man was hanged. I am obligated to hold him responsible for that mistake. I accept responsibility. It will be a scandal when the press finds out. Public confidence will be shaken. New methods are required, greater efficiency,... ...younger men perhaps. I must take drastic measures . I'm sorry to have to accept your resignation. I'm sorry. I have no alternative. For now, Buckley will be in charge. - I'm sorry. - On the contrary. He is delighted. Recognition for 30 years of service. From Her Majesty. From his fist and letter. I'll send for my stuff. I'll go through the file on the Kendall case. I will review what is necessary. Your professional instincts will surely find a clue. There is always a clue, if you look for it. However this case ends... ... tragedies like today's will not be repeated ... ...now that I'm in charge. Since my retirement I will watch your career with interest... ...and maybe with fun. - Superintendent Groodman, there's... - Mr. Goodman, now. An innocent man... Terrible mistake... We need new methods, younger men. Tragedies like today's will not be repeated . There is always a clue! Always! There's always... a clue... if you look for it. Hanged innocent man! - An innocent man! - What a disgrace! Who is responsible? - They should hang him. - What a shame! A disgrace to hang an innocent. Flowers? Hanged an innocent man! Scandal at Scotland Yard. The latest edition. hang me! - What a disgrace! - Hang an innocent. - Who is responsible? - They should hang him. Perfect. from 1881. Either you're with a new girl or an old bottle. You do not get tired? Maybe. Do you know better? He always arrives at 6. Out of habit, I suppose. How many medicines! Grodman worries me. Ever since he hung an innocent man for your aunt's death,... ...seems like a different man, as if obsessed. You will not think that he will die. No. But I would like to help you. Let's cheer him up. Knowing him, it was a tragedy for him. Good evening, Mr. G. Victor... ...Kendall, what a surprise. Is someone's birthday? Victor thought that with wine and good talk,... ...would be distracted. If I were Irish I would feel at my own funeral. Health. This will be an evening of wine, women, and song. Victor, you flatter me. You know I can't sing. Sr. G. - It's good to see him relaxed. - Perfect. He has been very depressed. You should not accept all the blame. My testimony supported the conviction. It seemed simple. My aunt had no enemies... ...except that man. Can't you forget it? I can't forget either. Today I discovered something important. Are you still working on the case? Off the record, of course. It is in the hands of my successor, Superintendent Buckley. - Maybe a fresh mind... - Yes, fresh mind. I decided to write a book about the famous cases I had. I hope it becomes a support book,... demonstrating the danger of circumstantial evidence,... ...and save another from the gallows. Marvelous. Great idea. Let me illustrate it. I draw the corpses exquisitely. I take the word. Your illustrations will help. It's a deal. - Is there someone? - Russell, good to see you. - Good evening, Russell. I wouldn't have missed this... Kendall. I didn't know you would come. - I'm wondering the same. - The same, again. The political differences between them... ...demonstrate a healthy situation. If you'll excuse me, I just came by to say hello. I must go... business. And those businesses are related to the Brockton miners. I will force you to give them decent working conditions. Being a parliamentarian does not give you the right to criticize my family. Of course he doesn't criticize your family. The Brockton miners are your constituents. And it is my duty to improve their conditions. They are deplorable. Go with the other crazy people in the park if they accept it. - I won't take this. - "Gentlemen", do you understand me? - He'll regret it. - I suggest a truce. A drink? Let's drink to the solution of our problems. Gentlemen, I invited you to cheer him up, not to fight. Do you always have to talk about politics? Do I always talk about my painting? Maybe yes. But it is not politics. - Here you have. - No, thanks. - And you? - Thank you. Excuse me. I have a meeting. I'm leaving on the first train to Brockton. - I'm sorry. - No apologies. Good night. Victor. Mister. The train to Brockton crashed once. It's a lot to ask for lightning to strike twice in the same place. What I like most about you is your tact and your sympathy. It's not my fault. Everything was going well until Russell threatened me. - I say good night. - Come back soon. When you get home, try not to fall. Annoying and I have to get up early. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. For men who live in the same house, they get along very badly. Next time, instead of barking, let them bite. Let's forget them. Let's go for a drink. - What's going on? - I warn you. You've gone too far. You warn me! Crap! I know things about you that would be good reading in the press. If you keep slandering me, I'll make you shut up... ...once and for all. - Mr. Kendall. - Lottie, what are you doing here? Waiting for you. I called you but you weren't there. - I said I couldn't see you. - Oh no! - What will your friends say, right? - For God's sake, keep your voice down. Don't be so conceited. I curse the day I met you. a cheater - Please. - You are a cheater. The jewels you gave me are garbage. - You're wrong. - Lie. I wanted to pawn the necklace for 2 pounds and they gave me 2 shillings. The same the rest. My uncle says that she is garbage. If they are false, they are very suitable. Very good, Arthur Kendall. But give me back the expensive fob I gave you. It has a good luck charm on it, which I don't wish on you. We'll fix this tomorrow. You go? I have friends who wouldn't hesitate to eliminate you. - At the Royal Music Hall. - Yes, Mrs. Too bad we couldn't continue. Maybe next time. The air has sinister currents today. It was exhilarating. I distracted myself from my problems. Thank you. The night is still young for wines and women. Goodbye, Mr. G. Good night Victor. Sra. Benson. Yes, Mr. Kendall... I'm coming. Don't forget to call me at 6. I will not forget. Good night. Good night. Mr. Kendall, it's after 6. Mr. Kendall, it's after 6. Mr. Kendall, why don't you answer? I've been knocking on Mr. Kendall's door for a long time. It's locked. Something is wrong. It will wake everyone up. Why do you come to me? Please come. I'll get dressed. - What a dirty morning. - I called and called... Keep calm. hurry up I know something bad has happened. I know. If something... If something happens to him, I... It's going to be 6:30. Responde, Kendall. Bust the door. How awful! Did you hear that scream? Shout? None. - Where you live? - Here. Number 32. This is the 31st, Mr. Mr. Kendall... is dead. What happened? What happened? Murdered. The door was locked. How could someone get in? Your aunt Hannah was murdered, and now... Police. - Call Supt. Buckley. - Yes sir. I wouldn't be surprised if it's very easy. - Police, do I take note? - Yes sir. This Mr. Victor Emmric, does he live in the house? Yes, I live on the top floor. Clive Russell, from Parliament, lives downstairs. - Shall I question him? - He's not in town. Represents Brockton. He left early by train. Who else lives here? Just me, sir. I live in the basement. How will I continue renting with all this? Poor Mr. Kendall. Murdered in a locked room. It's hard to know where to start. It will be the same one that killed Hannah Kendall. Some madman taking revenge on the whole family. - Excuse me, I'm leaving. - Clear. Don't hesitate to call me if you think I can help you. I think I can manage just fine. Thank you. Coroner, give me your report. The door and windows were locked from the inside. - And the fireplace? - Very small. There is no other way to enter. Walls and floors are solid. It was impossible for the killer to get in and then get out. Suicide was also impossible . There were no traces of weapons. - It's disconcerting. - We won't say that to the press. It is a murder carried out with diabolical mastery. We'll figure it out fast or the press will revive the Hannah case,... ...and they will try to relate them. What is this? - I want to call an expert. - Isn't that you? Expert in penetrating houses. Maybe it explains how someone got in. A thief! The police asking a thief for help. Alright. Forward. You. did you find the body? Mrs. Swenson. I helped break down the door. The name is Benson. B-E-N-S-O-N It was a horrible sight. Stabbed in the heart. I can't do it while moving. Go to the morgue and interview the corpse. Permission. - Mrs. Benson, come out, please. - What does it say? you too. - You watch the door. - Yes sir. Barney, these are the rooms. The corpse lay on the bed. The windows and the door were locked from the inside. How did the killer get in and how did he get out? A serious problem, gentlemen, but it is not impossible. What do you do with this? I took them from a sinner last night. I never thought they would be useful today. Gracias. Let's see. If I were in this situation, our killer... ...rather, his murderer... ...was able to close from the inside. Then... he was able to remove these hinges. So, he was able to lift the door up and take it out, see? So... ...was able to slide out. Then, with a wire, he replaced the hinges. Sounds reasonable. Is it your solution? No sir. These hinges need a screwdriver. But there is another way. Your killer ties a wire to this barrette. And lead the wire to the window. So... ...take some tweezers like these... ...walks out the door... ...and turns the key in the lock. Baja... ...he goes out and stands under the window... ...insert the wire and activate the pin. Is there room for the wire if the window is closed? No, there is not. This is ridiculous. He wasted valuable time for nothing. A very comfortable murder. It happened in front of my house. I have a front row box to follow the process. Luck. I need her. - The thief didn't tell us anything. - As I expected. I thought I might discover something. Don't you see? There is no clue. There's always some clue, if you look for it. It's like the perfect crime we always talk about. - That's me? - It is not? - And those horns? - They only exist in my imagination. I see. I would like to know more about her imagination. Why did he leave the house when he found the corpse? I didn't really walk away. I just didn't know where she was. He had been at a party. I drank too much. He was drunk. I walked home and... everything's a little fuzzy. That being the case, he could have been in Kendall's room and not know it. I was not there. You're not accusing Victor? How do I know you were at a party? Do you have witnesses? Yes, and lovely. There were some ladies from the choir. I'll talk to them. You will enjoy it. If you're looking for a clue, how about Kendall's girl? - What a Girl? - Lottie. - He works at the Royal Music Hall. - Lottie? They had a violent argument. - Are you making this up? - Because I would do? I can support what you say. We heard Lottie threaten Kendall that night. He said he had friends who would eliminate him like this. Why didn't you say it before? He didn't ask me for help. I thought I didn't want it. I will investigate. You sir. Don't go out of town. You might want to see it again. What do you think of the Superintendent? If you want to know, I really dislike him. How many mistakes will he make? He already made one. He dismissed... the size... ...of my pants. - Good night, Lottie. - Good night. Did you find what you were looking for? He followed me! Who is it? - Why did you follow me? - What is he doing here? I have a right to be here. - Who killed Kendall? - No... I'm Superintendent Buckley of Scotland Yard. - Was it you? "No. Why would she come back?" That happens. They heard her threaten Kendall. Many people who love each other fight, say things they don't mean. Maybe it was that. We were very friends. We often argued. what did he come for? I'll tell you the truth. I gave him a fob. He had a pendant with an affectionate inscription from me to him. That's what I was looking for. Maybe it was stupid... I do not believe you. Everything was recorded. We didn't find any of that. You must believe me... Listening, Mrs. Benson? Who with greater right? Always listening. I didn't say anything about her before. Protecting Mr. Kendall's good name . He was never the same, after meeting this creature. Old busybody... If you ask me, I'd say he's guilty. I'll catch you... - He's got enough trouble already. - Can not... You can't stop me for what she says. Thanks for coming so soon. You are welcome. I am always willing to help. How lucky you are not in charge of the case. Sit down. - It's not as easy as we thought. - As you thought. You know I arrested the singer Lottie two nights ago. Because he threatened Kendall? She denies it. She says it was an argument between lovers. They would love each other with great violence. I arrested her in Kendall's room . Did he receive her there? If it were my case, I would not ask that of an old bachelor. I ask because I think she knows more than she's letting on. He's very clever at cross-examining stubborn witnesses. He says he went to retrieve a fob he gave him. He was looking for her for sentimental reasons . It's not very convincing. We searched everything but we can't find her. I remember that Kendall was wearing a beautiful chain that night. So the killer stole it. Or it would be on his clothes when they buried him. To find out , you would have to ask... ...to the one who prepared the corpse for burial. Just what I was going to suggest... Would you like to join me? Just what I was going to suggest. Good idea. The problem is that you may not remember anything. We will know soon. Someone is coming. - ¿Sr. Robertson? - She, Sr. Buckley. Sorry to bother you. They said that he would not return to his office. TRUE. I have been very busy. Two funerals. Do you remember Mr. Kendall's funeral ? Oh yeah. Do you remember if he was buried with a fob and a watch? Let's see. Leontina and clock. We put on his evening dress, black pearl cufflinks... We don't want an inventory. Maybe they weren't black pearl. Or were they? The watch and the fob. Yes I'm going. She was wearing a signet ring with a crest. ...on his right little finger. - The fob. - I don't remember. Clocks are not usually included in the shroud. I don't remember if it was buried with or without the time. But the pendant with inscription shows beautiful feelings. - Have you reached the urn yet? - Is very close. Good evening, Supt. Buckley. Beautiful night. I prefer others. what did he come for? I always wanted to see an open grave. Especially at night. It is exciting. You seem to have more interest in Kendall after he's dead. That's it. Pass me the rope. Stop! Stop! Tomb desecrators . Stop! By what right do they violate that tomb? He had enough with such a horrible death. go away Let him rest in peace. That's enough, Sra. Benson. Something horrible will happen if you open that grave... Mr. Grodman. Mr. Grodman, you can stop them. Please. Come on, Mrs. Benson. We are not desecrating anything. Police. Take Mrs. to the entrance. take care of her Don't let anyone in. Come. keep working. Do you see something Victor? They will not let me. So badly that she wanted to see Kendall. Because? Buckley, did you find anything? I found this in a pocket. Mrs. Benson! Of those who love him from a distance. Very anxious to accuse Lottie, and her hysterics tonight. He sure didn't want us to know his secret. I would put that up during the funeral without dreaming that this would happen. It may be, but I'll question her again. And the fob? I found her just as Lottie described her,... ...confirming his statement. I guess it won't stop her anymore. On the contrary. I think he knows better. I will keep you under arrest. Please leave everything in order. Good night. Strange man. He likes to have people under arrest. Come on, Mr. G. Let's follow Kendall. I suppose your interest in this macabre matter is artistic. KENDALL CASES CONFUSE POLICE There is a cute stabbed for you to illustrate. I did 3 stabbings in a row. How about a strangled? Lottie returned to the Royal Music Hall. They announce their return after a successful tour. Buckley's sole suspect. How did she let go? I don't know, but we can figure it out. We work a lot. It will do us good to have fun. - Evening dress, Victor? - But of course. Give me a little. A little bit will hit the spot. I can't with a lot. Only a little. ...It's enough. My eyes widen, my hips move. And then, my self-control goes from here... ...there. So give me a little. More than a little wine,... ...can make me happy. Don't despair if I kiss your cheek. Don't be mad if I pinch your nose. Let's be fair, what do you think I'm looking for? You know I have enough... ...of everything I want... except love. So give me a little. A little... ...of love. Show me your friendship. Well, love and friendship go hand in hand. A smile can be the way to a kiss. And each kiss, they say, deserves... ...A repeat. So love me a little. And in a little while we will love each other a little bit more. - You like me? - Clear. Here it comes. It was wonderful. More charming than ever. I should go home, but... But he thought to cheer up two loners. Yes, rejoice. Waiter, a glass. When I saw you, gentlemen, I said to myself... ...that looked like champagne. Big and small bubbles. More than a little wine,... ...can make me happy. Don't despair if I kiss your cheek. - It doesn't matter if I pinch your nose. - I don't mind. Let's be fair. What do you think I'm looking for? You know I have enough. Of everything I want... ...less love. - I think I'll sit down. - Very good, Miss Lottie. Good. It's very early. It's too late. I haven't had this much fun since poor Arthur died. Poor Arthur. I used to like that very much. I like you too, Victor. And you to me, Lottie. - You too. - Nobody likes cops. You like me. He is the nicest of all. The next time they arrest us, let him do it, right? Clear. Mr. G. and not that evil Buckley. It is awful. He detained me for a week because I liked Arthur. Now it's something else. I told him he has no right to bother me... ...while freeing the parliamentarian. Don't tell me you suspect a member of parliament? Why not, if so? - I know some things. - I'm sure you do. Some things, but not about Clive Russell. I know a lot about him. I heard him threaten poor Arthur. I liked Arthur a lot even though he didn't turn out very good. I always get the bad guys. But I assure you that I am very good. There is no good man . Maybe not, in our circle. But Russell is a good man. It is not. I know more about him than I told Buckley. He is not very clean. Do you know what Arthur discovered? That Russell was seeing a woman... on the sly. - Don't do me like that. - Do not do it. He even found out her name, Frieda. - Frieda what, dear? - Frieda... something. I don't remember. But I remember that Russell told Arthur that he would silence him,... ...once and for all. Now the poor thing is dead. Poor Arthur. Poor Victor. Don't let Russell find out that you know. Poor Victor. Sra. Benson. - Mrs. Benson, are you there? - Yes, Mr. Russell. - Was someone in my room? - Just me... cleaning. Did someone come to the house? No, sir. Only the Supt. Buckley of Scotland Yard... ...asking me horrible questions. Supt. Buckley. I'm coming. - Good morning, Mr. Russell. - Are you Mr. Grodman? I'm waiting for it. Do you want to wait for it? Thanks, yes. Gracias. - What's up, Russell? -She was waiting for him. Sure, is something wrong? I think so. It could be my imagination... ...but for days I think they follow me. I just got to my room and someone had searched it. It was probably the police. Does it amaze you? Of course. What can the police want from me? Buckley heard that you had an argument with Kendall the night of the murder. He got mad because I didn't tell him. Why do you suspect me? She was in Brockton. Maybe I can help you, if you tell the truth. Buckley found out you didn't go to Brockton. You got there 3 days later. Where were you? I can not tell. So I can't help you. I can't say where I was. It would involve... I just can't. Would it involve a lady's honor ? This is not the time for that. Maybe the lady doesn't care. Sometimes they enjoy it. - It's not that kind. - I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It... Frieda Pendelton. Her husband denied her a divorce. They have not lived together for 3 years. - We are looking for a solution. - I understand. Maybe I exaggerate. The police will catch the culprit. If Buckley's still suspicious, I thought you could talk to him. It would be wise to tell him about Lady Pendleton. I don't want to involve her. No, Mr. Grodman. Give me your word that you won't tell anyone about this. You have my word... as well as my respect. Let's go to the club for a drink. I think you need it. Gracias. I know it's an imposition. But I could only go to you. No imposition, son. I'll think something. - Hello Victor. - Hello, Mr. G. I just saw our friend Buckley. Still suspicious of you? Not just me, but Lottie and Russell. Suspect everyone. He is a bit crazy. Perhaps soon he will also suspect the Queen. He thought he was very clever. He tried to question me about Lottie,... ...so it cost him a lot of liquor. Lottie again? He says they're watching his every move. - All his movements? - A disturbing thought. He's going to question her tonight... about Frieda Pendleton. He thinks that she knows more than what she has said. - Who? - The Supt. Buckley. In between. Hola, Lottie. I'm glad to see you. Someone threw this out the window. Don't talk about Frieda. Let them search the street. Who threatens her? I don't know. It will be the same one who murdered Arthur. Now he's coming for me. I'm afraid. Who is Frida? Orchids suit me. I don't want them to kill me. Was Kendall pressing Russell about Frieda? - I don't know. - Tell me. If not, I won't be able to protect her. It's true. Why does it keep bothering me? Arrest Russell before he kills me. I'm afraid. I'm taking this. Will it stop him? For your safety, do not tell anyone about this. Nothing suspicious outside, Mr. Who is it? Goes into. - Good night. - Hello. - I bother you? - I'll be ready right away. Take your time. There's no hurry. I saw Buckley outside. What does he want now? The police? He consults me on all his cases. Oh yeah? - Did you bring me something? - Only this. Orchids. I thought you are doing very well. Of course. I always look in case there is a surprise. Victor, it's beautiful. I'm glad you like it. - Victor. - Yeah? Come here. - Help me. - I will do that. Give me a little, a little... ...a little bit. ...of love. Give me a little... Who is at the door? It's you, Mr. Emmric. Yes. I think it's me. That's how it is. I want to close the door. I'm so sorry if I woke you up. I was just resting. I haven't slept well since what happened. The press brings a lot about murders,... ...and about the Kendall case. - Close well, sir. - I will do that. I should have a police whistle, just in case. I should, but how do I whistle if someone slits my throat? - Had not thought of that. - Go? It doesn't blow. - Goodnight Mr. - Good night. Sweet dreams. Amor... Give me a little... Good night. A little bit. ...of love. ...and my self control... ...goes this way... ...and over there. SENSATIONAL WEEKLY. KENDALL KILLER ON THE LOOSE Someone entered my room. Call the police. I'll search the house. Help! Killer! Killer! Someone tried to kill Mr. Emmric. Wake up, Mr. Grodman! Mr. Grodman, wake up! you again. It is the evil one. Mr. Emmric shot him. Mr. Emmric, are you there? Do you listen me? - What's going on? - I don't know. Someone tried to break into my room and... look. The window is open. Let's see if he's behind. Mr. G. Glad you're here! Somebody broke into my room. I don't know how I could fail. Are you OK? I am very afraid. I feel like I'm marked. Did you see it? No. I only saw a gloved hand,... ...who slowly opened the door. - What is happening? - Did you find the evil one? - What evil? - They tried to kill Victor. It is the evil one. I fired at him, but missed. - My aim is bad. - There's no one behind, sir. Where is Mr. Russell? A Brockton. Good. I have important news to give you. Let's go to Kendall's room. - Hi, Russell. - They tried to kill Emmric. I thought you were in Brockton. He was going to give a talk to the miners. It was cancelled. Or missed the train again? - I don't understand. - Come with us. I know exactly how Kendall was killed. It will interest everyone. It was not evil. The killer knew Kendall well. He knocked on the door and they let him in. So, he murdered Kendall. To mislead his crime, he closed from the inside. Then he yanked hard until he broke the pin. He left the room, closed the door behind him,... ...and with a pair of tweezers he turned the key from the outside. When they broke the door and the lock,... ...looked like the pin was broken. I searched the killer's room. I found a sharp knife,... ...a purchase receipt dated the day before the crime,... ...and a ticket to Brockton that he never used. The killer is Mr. Russell. - This is a trick. - No, Mr. What you say can be used as evidence. You won't believe it's true. He couldn't do it. He's not the type. There is no typical murderer. you know it. He hated Kendall, threatened him and killed him. Police. Arrest this man. Russell, you're under arrest for Kendall's murder. Do you think it is possible? Very smart, yes. But not enough for Scotland Yard. When we left court I thought we would take 10 minutes. We've already been 9 hours. Isn't it breakfast time? What's wrong with you? That you 11 think he's guilty doesn't force me. - He had many reasons. - Everything points to him as guilty. Sirs! Let's go over everything again. The girl from the theater heard when she threatened him. And Messrs. Grodman and Emmric. They are your friends. They didn't want to testify, but they did. Russell was enemies with Kendall because of the miners. Kendall found out about the woman. The scandal would have ruined his political career. Russell insists that he went to Brockton and never took the train. For the unused ticket they found in his drawer. Yes. Which led to the train employees being questioned. They know him but did not see him that night. One minute. Don't forget this knife. They found it in the drawer too. That's it, gentlemen. That is exactly. Do you think someone so skilled would keep the ticket and knife? He didn't get rid of them. That is the test. TRUE. Russell, a gentleman with a brilliant career,... ...loses his head, makes a serious mistake. Murder. With devilish inspiration he fixes the door,... ...and you think you covered everything. While the most obvious signs are ignored. If I hadn't missed them... ...we wouldn't be here right now. I would have committed the perfect crime... ...as directed by Superintendent Buckley. 9, culpable. 10, culpable. 11, culpable. 12, culpable. The verdict is unanimous. Guilty. Clive Russell, the judgment of the court,... ...is that he return to the prison from which he came,... ...and from there to a place of execution,... ...and there he is hanged by the neck until he dies. May God have mercy on his soul. The appeal was denied. The date was set in three weeks. Three weeks. As a kid, 3 weeks seems like an eternity. Let it be three days or three hours. There's nothing to do. Yes. There is one thing we can do. Lady Pendleton. I tried to talk to him. He's not in London. He traveled I don't know where. Don't put her in this. He gave me her word. And I have fulfilled it. But it's her life. If you love him, you won't care about the rest. You must tell me where it is. - He went to France a month ago. - Where to? Last I heard, he was in Cannes. But it will no longer be there. She paints. Pick the spot on the Riviera at random. It shouldn't be that hard. He doesn't know what's going on. And you're unfair to her by not telling her. I'll find her... and I'll bring her back. - ¿Lady Pendleton? - ¿Lady Pendleton...? Where is? - Can you hurry up? - I do, sir. ¿Lady Pendleton? He shows me the path of truth,... And though I walk through the valley of death, I will not fear. Only 4 hours. Patience, son. There's still time. Mr. Grodman will not let you down. Hopefully. Wait here. Grodman, ¿es Ud.? Yeah. - He didn't find her. - I found her... too late. She's dead. - Dead? - I'm sorry to give you such tragic news. It doesn't matter, Mr. Grodman. He already gives the same. Nothing matters now. Thanks for everything. Come on son. Excuse me, haven't you had enough to drink? Yes, but... sometimes enough is not enough. Enough knowing that the dawn will bring death? - I don't know, sir. - Sees it? Nobody knows. Nobody. Good night. I suspected Emmric knew more... Come in, Victor. I was waiting for you. I saw your light. - It's a sad night. - Maybe you're the sad one. I want you to help me with the last chapter of my book. It deals with the Kendall, Russell and Frieda Pendleton cases. I don't think my hands are steady today. I found this button in my closet,... ...after you were there. So do you know the ending? The last chapter? Yeah,... You do not? I want a drink. I prefer to work another day. There won't be another day. Things will happen between us that we cannot control. Arthur Kendall killed his aunt Hannah. That night I found out they had argued. She threatened to disinherit him and was murdered. I knew you were suspicious of him. Fabricated a false case of circumstantial evidence,... ...against an innocent man, and sent him to his death. He took advantage of my friendship. Nobody will do that again. Yes. I hated him for that. For causing him so much shame and humiliation. I hated it. I realized. I once thought that your case would be an unsolvable mystery. To save Russell, all that remains is to reveal the murderer. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come. I'm afraid that... I'm very afraid... ...the drink is watered down... maybe it's me. It's you. Alcohol does not overcome fear. I suppose not. Come on Victor. - We have a commitment. - Where? Newgate Prison. - Mr. G., does it have to be like this? - Yes, Victor. It must be so. Coachman! Come on. It's getting late. To Newgate Prison. Hurry up, coachman. We should have left earlier, but I wanted to wait until the last moment. Thus Buckley's defeat will be as bitter as he made mine. You knew the answer all along. Why then was he giving her false leads? Privileges of a vengeful mind. He supposed Buckley would blame Russell. Playing the fool by trying to convict him. Would have been fun. But one man's honor changed everything. Now, the Supt. Buckley comes off as very cunning. Yes, very clever... ...for now. Forward. Messrs. Grodman and Emmric, Mr. Good morning. Good morning gentlemen. - Was the execution stayed? - Of course not. What does your presence here at this hour mean? Supt. Buckley. Do you assume responsibility for the execution to be carried out? - Clear. - Do you know anything else about this case? Something very important. He has no idea who or how Kendall was killed. Crap! Despite himself, my theory was correct. It was supported by the judge and jury. Little knowledge is very dangerous. you had very little. He searched for evidence to support his ridiculous theory. Gentlemen, Russell is not the culprit. I'll tell you how Kendall was killed. He was still alive when Mrs. Benson knocked on his door. But he did drink something in his last drink the night before. Something that would make him sleep despite the knock on the door. When Mrs. Benson came, I wasn't sleeping. Although I made him believe so . Buckley guessed that the killer, after killing Kendall,... ...by magic, he left the locked room. He actually killed him after breaking down the door. Mrs. Benson is very impressionable. He thought he saw more than he actually saw. In the time I was alone with an unconscious Kendall,... ...I killed him. One stab was enough. Exactly as I planned. He not only killed his aunt,... ...but allowed an innocent man to pay for his crime. It was double murder. There was no other way to execute him. With this, I built a crime without solution. I exposed Buckley's inefficiency,... ...who foolishly believed that such a crime did not exist. You will find the details in my book. Russell! Governor, stop the execution. Why does it stay there? See that the editor gets this,... ...after the police verify it. It is a summary of my professional experience. I tried to enter your room. I knew you were suspicious. I wanted to scare you. It doesn't matter. They will say that I committed an act of incomprehensible evil. Whether it is so or not, is something that will remain without a verdict. Goodbye Victor. Alright. Goodbye, Mr. G.
