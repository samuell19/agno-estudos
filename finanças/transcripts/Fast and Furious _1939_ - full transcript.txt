Extra. Extra! Hottest day in ten years. And I don't mean maybe. Extra. Extra. A neighbor of mine by the name of Kelly said it was 99 at his place yesterday. Our place was hotter than Kelly's. 6th floor. Good morning, Mr Sloane. Good morning, darling. Here, young lady. Why didn't you wake me up this morning before you left? I was going to but you were sleeping so soundly. You know, it took me 6 months, 7 nights a week to make you see things my way. Was that so difficult? - Until I took the bull by the horns .. Got you drunk, rushed you in the car to Connecticut and made you mine. Darling, now we've been married three years I think I can tell you the truth. Yeah? - I wasn't drunk. Boy. It certainly is hot. Funny I didn't notice it on the street. I'm afraid it will get still hotter. - Nonsense. Look, Garda. This order from Cameron Company has to be filled right away. They've given us a lot of very important .. Say. You are right. It is getting hotter. A hundred and three. This is the hottest thing since the Chicago fire. What's that, dear? Doesn't that look nice and cool? It certainly does. Say, that gives me an idea. - It does? You know what? - What? Business has been pretty slow. Everyone out of town. It's so darn hot. Why don't we close the office and go away on a vacation? Darling, you have the most wonderful ideas. We go tonight. By tomorrow we'll be in the mountains. Comfortable and cool. No heatwave to bother us. Aah! So that's how the heatwave started, huh? Now how do you suppose that heat pad got under your chair? The seven dwarves did it, I suppose? Darling, I am so sorry. I thought we both needed a vacation and I wanted you to think of it by yourself. I did. The hottest idea I ever had. Get me a fork. I think I'm about done. [ Buzzer ] I'll see who it is. If it's a customer, don't set fire to him. No, dear. Well, look who's here. Joel, how are you? - Mike. It's good to see you. What's new? Same old thing. Eric Bartell is putting on a show and I'm getting it under way. In college we voted Mike the man most likely to succeed. He was class valedictorian too. What were you, the class bum? Joel, I got to catch a train back to my job and I must talk to you. Sit down. Shoot. Well, it is .. It is kinda personal. - Oh. I can take a hint as well as the next wife. My wife is the most tactful little woman in the whole world. Absolutely no curiosity. Isn't that right, dear? Just the same, I won't tempt you. Would you mind hanging you hat over the keyhole? Well Mike, what's on your mind? Joel, it's like this. I hate to bother you .. Shush. What about, Mike? You got those two dames lined up for tonight? You take the platinum-haired babe. Me for the redhead. I'm sick of blondes. Blondes are deceitful. My wife, for instance. At this minute she's listening over this dictogram. Yea, you. Now get off that gadget and go back to work. Unburden yourself, Michael. What can the firm of Joel Sloan and Company do for you today? A great deal, Joel. I need five thousand dollars. Five thousand dollars? You mean .. a five and three zeros? Just as a short-term loan. See, my boss is giving me a chance to buy in on his best promotion this year. I have five thousand saved and if I raise another five it's all set. We've been friends a long time. There is nobody I'd rather help but .. That's a lot of money. - It's gilt edged. Eric Bartell is promoting a beauty pageant down at Seaside City. A beauty pageant? Girls in bathing suits? Yeah. The show can't miss, Joel. It's backed by big hotels, railroads, the chamber of commerce and everybody. We've enough contracts already to show a big profit. You get your money back in four weeks. - No, Mike. I'm a married man. If I get mixed up in a beauty pageant I won't live four weeks. Okay, Joel. Does it really mean that much to you, Mike? Does it? This is the first big chance that ever came my way. I have to swing it somehow. There you are. I was saving that for my old age but this sounds like more fun. Joel, you're a prince. If it helps you get started. That's all I care about. I don't know how or what to say. On your way before you you miss your train. That's right. Come down and see the pageant. I'll make all the arrangements for you. Goodbye and thanks a million. - Forget it. Well, whatever he wanted he certainly looks as if he got it. It was nothing really. He just forgot the old fraternity grip and I brushed him up on it. What's the matter? Come down here. Stick out your tongue. All of it? Oh, doctor. Just as I thought. - Don't you want to examine me? I have some very nice symptoms. Garda, a hot city is the worst place in the world for a girl in your condition. Let's see. Where shall we go? The mountains? Too high up. Maine? - Too low down. I've got it. Seaside City. Fresh air. Outdoor sports. I've heard a lot about the scenery. - That will be wonderful. Then it's all set. We'll go tonight. - No. Not tonight. I have some shopping to do first. Shopping? You mean clothes? - Just a few things. A new wrap. Maybe a traveling suit. A couple of .. Pairs of shoes. While I'm at the shops is there any little thing I can get you, dear? Get me a sand bucket and a shovel. I must be in my second childhood. Now everybody's swinging. Getting right in the groove. Mike. Hello Joel. How are you? Hello Garda. Mike. What are you doing here? Are these for me? - Not exactly. I'm connected with the beauty pageant. I'm meeting one of the girls. A beauty pageant? Girls? Well, fancy that. Well, well, well. Excuse me. There she is. Welcome to Seaside City, Miss Brooklyn. I am certainly glad to be here. Gee, there's a real band and everything. - Here's some flowers for you. Now, boys. Get a few pictures of Miss Brooklyn. Some big close-ups. Full figure. Hello, Mr Bartell. Hurry up now, boys. Say, if it isn't Joel Sloan. - It certainly is. This is Mr Bartell. Mike's boss. My wife. - How do you do. Say, Mike. I must see you a minute. Listen, when you leave Miss Brooklyn at the hotel, hold on to the flowers. We have other girls to meet. Flowers cost money. Go ahead now. I have to meet someone. - Okay. How are you, Connors? Hiya, Bartell. What's the matter, Ed? Anything wrong? - I didn't come here for the fresh air. Let's go where we can talk. Now, Ed. You're making quite a row about a simple business transaction. It's not the first time I've owed you a few thousand for a little while. It ain't a few thousand. It's twenty grand. It's been more than a little while. - I've had a few bad breaks, Ed. But this show will clean up. The minute it closes you get your money. Yeah. If you are still here to pay it. Look, Bartell. I'll talk turkey. I came down here as I heard rumors you were skipping when the show closes. With the money. - Well, that's a lie. It had better be. I suppose I should be mad at you, but the whole story is too silly. When we get back to the office I'll give you 5,000 in cash. On account mind you. The minute the show closes you get the balance. Okay. Hey. You just registered on the room clerk's cuff. I'm sorry, old man. I guess I had something in my eye. - A beam I should say. And rather a broad beam. Oh, thank you. Not at all. He thanks you too. Don't you, dear? Darling, try to restrain the beast in you. I thought you were about to whinny. Did you see those shameless bathing suits? I was shocked. Yes. You loved it. Tell you what I'll do. I'll let you stare at three girls a day. One after every meal. Make it four. That covers afternoon tea. Three is the best I can do. I lose money on the deal at that. Alright, darling. Now I want some lunch. I'm hungry. Aren't you? Have it sent up. - The menu is on the desk, sir. Thanks. What do you see that's good? Guess what I have in my hand, darling. It's a little early for guessing games. Aha. A menu. - Right. No. Wrong. Has the salt air gone to your head, dear? Darling, you order something. I'll be right back. I must see the manager. He promised me a room overlooking the ocean. But this one overlooks the ocean. - But I don't like this ocean. What's funny? Nothing. Only the last place I worked was an insane asylum. I was hoping this would be a little different. I can't help it if Miss Los Angeles' bathing suit is too tight. Look how Los Angeles has grown in the last few years. Miss Thompson, you'd better order .. - Mike. Hi, Joel. A fine double-crossing pal you turned out to be. I'm listed as a judge in this clambake. - I thought you'd love the idea. Never mind about how I feel. Garda will just about kill me. I'm in enough trouble just looking at the girls. Sorry, Joel. We sent out fifty thousand of these. Fifty thousand? - Yeah. We won't send out any more. Naturally, if you don't want to be a judge you needn't go through with it. What? Oh yeah. Well, as long as I am trapped. Swell. That's the spirit. I'll fix you up with an official pass and a badge. How about a tape measure? - Huh? There you are. - Thank you. Mike. - Yes? Who authorised Miss Jerry Lawrence to use the firm's account and stores? There must be some mistake, Lily. - We'll see about that. Miss Cole - Mr Sloane. - How do you do. I'd say offhand, trouble's brewing for somebody. Lily is Bartell's publicity director. Has been for years. But lately the boss has taken an interest in one of the beauties and .. It's affected her disposition. Mike. Will you come in here please? Sure. So long. - See you later at the hotel. Judge Sloane to you. Okay. Mike, there's apparently been a mistake about this bill. You call Miss Lawrence. See she pays for these things herself or returns them. Do it now. Satisfied now, Lily? I am not. You think I'll stand by as you throw away money .. On a blond gold-digger like Jerry Lawrence? You let her charge those clothes. - You're getting excited over nothing. Over nothing? Making a fool of yourself at a time like this. Listen to me. When the pageant closes and we take the money. The cops will be chasing us. I don't care about that. I'll risk anything for you. I know that, Lily. I haven't finished yet and I want you to hear it all. You can't get rid of me. Not after all these years and what I've done for you. I won't stand for it. And now I'm going to make that plain to Jerry Lawrence. Now, ladies and gentlemen. Miss Jerry Lawrence who is a contestant in the beauty pageant. Will model a new creation. Miss Lawrence, I must speak to you for a minute. Certainly, Miss Cole. What is it? - Let's go into the bar. Sit down. And listen closely. My dear, you're to stay away from Eric Bartell. That is an order. What do you mean? - You're not to graft any more clothes. If Mr Bartell lets me buy things it's not your business. I've made it my business. You'll stop chasing him. I don't have chase any man of yours, you washed up .. Now remember what I told you. How do you do, Miss Cole. A double Scotch please. - Yes, sir. Are you Mr Sloane? I reckon that is my handle, partner. How do you know? She said you'd ask for a double scotch. She? She who? Who is 'she'? She is the one who left the note. Don't tell me. I know. The note she left. Yeah. That's it. - Where is it? Where is what? - The note. Oh yeah. The note. What's the matter? Ain't you going out there? I read it. - So I see. No, my snooping Bacchus. It's cheaper in here. Come here. Yes, dear. Make that a triple Scotch. What puts a girl over? Publicity. Who can give you publicity? A newspaperman. What am I? The best newspaperman in America. The last girl I took an interest in has already married 2 millionaire husbands. And she's only twenty-two. You can do the same. When I met her she was pressing shirts in a laundry. Think of it, Emmy Lou. A few days later the whole world was at her feet. Yes. You remind me of that girl, Emmy Lou. I see in you the same qualities. Breeding, refinement and culture. I can be a great help to you. Remember that. To prove it I'll show you the newspaper clippings. Besides, I know the judges. One, Joel Sloane, is a personal friend of mine. Mr Bentley, honey. Do you think it would be alright? You see, before I left home .. I promised my mother I wouldn't even talk to a yankee. Your mammy is perfectly right, honeychild. Tarnation take them no-account northern critters. A gal ain't safe with them no how. Mr Bentley, sugar. It didn't know y'all was a southern gentleman. Now we have our geography straightened out. Do you believe me, that I can help you? Joel Sloane. Honeychild, this is the man I was telling you about. Professor Joel Sloane. World famous Viennese beauty specialist. He is a judge in the contest. The professor speaks absolutely no English, honey. Now run along, Emmy Lou. I'll stay and give you a big build-up with the professor. Fortunately, I speaks his native tongue. Alright. Goodbye, professor. That Dixie talk sure is hard on the nerves. It sure is. What are you doing down here, Ted? Writing this thing up for a newspaper syndicate. You lucky dog are a judge. What a man. It's just due to hard work, enterprise, initiative, intelligence .. And plenty of gall, dear. Don't forget that. Hello dear. - Hello Garda. Well, Ted. I haven't seen you in ages. Didn't you get my note? No. Oh, of course. I was just coming darling but I met Ted. I know. You had a drink. Then one thing led to another so you had another. Let's have another. - Fine. We've had enough. Let's get some air. - It's not enough for me. We'll get some more. So long, Ted. We're in room 726. Come up any time. That is almost any time. Professor. This is professor Sloane, girls. A famous Viennese beauty specialist. He don't speak English but he's awfully handsome. He's a beauty contest judge. A shame he can't talk. He's a very cute judge. Judge? So you are a judge, huh? You low, contemptible snake. Garda, believe me. It's a mistake. - A mistake? My, but you've learned to talk English fast, professor. I am very glad to have met you girls. Come on, dear. You have to get dressed. Dressed for what? You wouldn't want to be buried in that suit, would you? Garda, believe me. Go after her. Hurry. I'll come up and help you out. She won't have a chance to do anything. You haven't got a bulletproof vest handy by any chance? Come on. Darling, I know I'm listed as one of the judges but it's a typographical error. So are you. - Give me a chance to explain. That's all your life is. One explanation after another. Garda. And what were you going to measure with this, Mr Sloane? High tide. Darling, this is the truth. I know I'm a judge but .. It's not my fault. Mike Stevens did it. He thought I'd like the idea. I was furious. Of course you were. Why should Mike Stevens fall over himself trying to make you so happy? Who's happy? - You know what I mean. Why did we come here and how did you get to be a judge? Joel. That day at the office. Did you give Mike any money? Money? You mean that green stuff? Now, honey. Break that and they put it on the bill. It's worth it. I count to 3 and if you don't come clean with the whole story by then .. One, two. [ Buzzer ] Just a minute, dear. Ted Bentley. Fancy meeting you here. Come on in, all of you. You're just in the nick of time. Look, dear. It's good old Ted Bentley. I see him. We were just wandering around and thought we'd drop in. I am glad you did. Make yourselves at home everybody. - Thanks. Look. We can't be rude to good old Ted and his friends. They won't stay long. Just long enough for a cocktail. Alright. I mix the drinks. - That's sweet of you. Good old Ted Bentley. I'm going to mix good old Ted a good old Mickey Finn. Say, Clancy. Take a run up to 726. Joel Sloane's room. Tell him to soft pedal on that noise. They're practically quiet now. Darling, isn't it wonderful? The party started with just a handful of people and look at it now. Don't think you've pulled the wool over my eyes. This party was just a ruse to keep me from pulling you apart piece by piece. They have to go sometime and when they do .. Garda. It was all my fault. I got Joel mixed up in all this. I made him a judge. He had no choice. Those are the facts, Garda. - A likely story. You bluebeard. Excuse me, dear. I have to welcome a guest. Another one. Hello. Hello. Glad you came, old man. Glad you came. My wife and I just wondered if you'd be able to make it. Come on over here and make yourself at home. I'll bring you a drink right away. Pardon me, brother. Ever hear of Captain Joe Burke? Huh? - That's me. Captain Joe Burke and his five ferocious African lions. Not a vegetarian in the quintet. Glad to meet you, captain. Come again soon and bring the lions. The fact is the act's in hock right now. I need $1,000 to get it started again. You still need it. Brother, won't you let me bring my lions up here and show you a few routines? No, brother. Positively no. Please, brother. Won't you let me? Mr Bartell, can you be interested in .. - Beat it, Burke. What's so funny, Ted? - Look in the mirror. I just wanted to talk to Mr Bartell. That's all. Mister Bartell, Jerry? That's a laugh. If I know you at all it's 'Eric dear' by now. At least. - I guess that's your business. Strictly speaking, no. I don't want you to get in trouble, Jerry. And you're headed for a large order of it. Thanks. You always were considerate and thoughtful. Believe it or not, I am thinking of you. Be smart. Drop Bartell. And pick you up again, Ted? No thanks. The mighty Casey has struck out. Shame on you, Ted Bentley, making eyes at that girl. When your little southern girl is just pining for you. He is a beast. Not the home-loving faithful type like me. We'll discuss that later, dear. Here comes the other part of Bartell's triangle. Lily. I'm glad you came up. Hello, Miss Cole. Darling, this is Miss Cole. Mr Bartell's assistant. How do you do. I'll get you a drink. - No. I can only stay a minute. Is Mr Bartell here? - Well, he .. He's out on the terrace I think, Lily. Thanks. You tactless cluck. She'll murder the poor guy. He's out there with Jerry Lawrence. - Holy smokes. Aren't any of you men satisfied with just one girl? I am, darling. Even if I were surrounded with beautiful women my thoughts would still be .. It looks like she lost the first round. I think there's been a slight blow off. That is one gone. Darling, you think a rumor I had leprosy would get some of our guests to leave? As far as I'm concerned it's more than a rumor. Mr Bentley. Mr Bentley. Can I see you a minute? Can you get some people out of here? My husband and I want to get some sleep. It shall be as you say. - Thank you. Looking for the way out, old man? Right over here. Say. What was I about to do when Bentley broke in here with his maniacs? You were going to hit me over the head with a lamp. Maybe I will. Just let me catch you taking one measurement, Joel Sloane. Within reaching distance of bathing beauties. This is my vacation. I'm all washed up as a judge, Garda. Cross my heart. Stick to it or you'll be washed up as a husband. [ Buzzer ] Now what? Just the buzzer, darling. Somebody at the door. Didn't you pack my robe? Wait a minute. I am going with you. If that's Bentley with another gag I'll slam the door in his scheming face. Telegram, sir. - A telegram? Thanks, son. I knew he'd look like that. Give me that, dummy. It's from your policeman friend, Sam Travers. The old police dog is on someone's trail down here. He probably wants you to help him sniff up a few clues. Joel, you won't get mixed up in anything, are you? On my vacation? I mean on your vacation? I should say not. - That's a good boy. Travers can get someone else to help him. The rest of this trip is just for us two. No business. No bathing beauties. There you are. Fine. The idea of a bathing beauty actually swimming is a terrific novelty. I always wanted to see what happens to these suits if they ever really got wet. You can train me to swim. Yeah. You can be second. You're in the southern league. Now what do I do first? - Just relax. Come on. If you've got confidence nothing will happen. How am I doing? - Well. Alright, I guess. A wise guy, huh? Fancy meeting you here. Which one of you girls bit me? You or Miss Brooklyn? You'll know tomorrow. If it was Miss Brooklyn in the you'll have hydrophobia. Next time don't forget to duck. That girl certainly packs a wallop too. So do I. Remember. If you want to teach someone to swim, that's what your wife's for. Darling, isn't this better than being in a stuffy office all day? Are you glad I made you take a vacation? - Delighted. We'll be the most sunburnt people in the poorhouse when we get back. No cares, no worries, no mail to answer. No people breaking in. If those aren't policemen's feet, I've never read a detective story. Hello Joel. Hello Travers. - Officer, this man is molesting me. Pull up a chair, Sam. No. I won't do it. - Joel, we need you. Since you helped on the Torrence case. - Save the soft soap. I'm serious. When the DA and I found out you were a judge in this pageant .. Now, he is an ex-judge. I retired him. - What about the pageant, Sam? Eric Bartell. We expect an indictment against him on a stock swindle and he may skip. He'd be crazy to skip. Every day the money rolls in. He just made a deal for the girls to wear Catherine Hosiery. He got a thousand bucks. I found out that Bartell withdraws all pageant funds every day in cash. That's awful. I'll find Mike Stevens right away and tell him. Wait a minute, Joel. Bartell won't try to get away for another few days. Let Sam handle it, darling. No reason for you to get mixed up in it. Oh no? What about the money? - What money? Joel, did you ..? I'm just thinking of the money poor Mike invested. All he had. I can't let him be trimmed like this. I am sorry, Miss. Mike, I have to talk to you right away. What's the matter? Mike, Bartell is in a jam over some stock scheme. He wants to skip town with the pageant money. What? Are you sure of this? Sam Travers of the NY Police just arrived in town. He has checked with the bank. It's true. He won't get away with it and leave town with my money. Mike, keep your head. Let's get Travers. You get anybody you please. I'm going to get Bartell. Don't get nervous, honey. Soon we'll be a long way from here. We are going, aren't we Eric? There won't be any slip-up. Not a one. I have the tickets, the money and everything. Darling, can't they trace you through the checks you signed? It's all in cash, honey. There's nothing to worry about. [ Buzzer ] Yeah? I go to lunch now, Mr Bartell. Grace. Is Mr Bartell in? Yes. He's inside. - Thanks. He is with Miss Lawrence. - Oh. Then I won't bother him. Jerry, you all packed? Better get your stuff to the station and check it through to the boat. We may have to slip away suddenly. - I'll do it when I get to the hotel. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? - Stevens. Open up. Open the door, Bartell. Come in, Mike. What's all the trouble? You tell me. I hear you've taken personal charge of all the money. Me? You can't get away with this. I used every cent of my own and borrowed more. You're not running out with it. Take it easy, Mike. I never intended to take your money. You won't. I want every cent of it right now. Give me until tomorrow night and you'll get it all back. I said right now. You've got it in cash so it's probably handy. Get it. And if I don't get every cent of that ten thousand bucks back now .. You leave town in a hearse. - What did you say? You heard me. Alright, Mike. If that's the way you feel about it. I'll get it for you right now. [ Gunshot! ] Bartell. Bartell! I suppose I was an awful chump to put money in the pageant, Sam. Mike and I are very old friends. Somebody's in an awful hurry. Joel. Hurry up. I think Bartell shot himself. What happened? He went in his room, locked the door and I heard a shot. I couldn't get inside. Come in here. We'll have to break the door down because it is locked. I thought you said the door was locked. Well, he is dead alright. - Suicide? Sure. Suicide. Shot himself in the back, unlocked the door, threw away the gun. Then laid down and died. Stevens. I have to turn you over to the police. Me? Hello Joel. Looks like I'm in a swell mess. They're sure I killed Bartell. Yeah. A few things do look bad. We can get them straightened out in a hurry. Sit down. I want to talk to you. Sorry about your money, Joel. - Forget the money. The thing that interests me now is to get you out of this tight corner. I have to work fast. Somebody was with Bartell when you got there. A woman. I didn't see anybody. - She was there all the same. Bartell may have led her to the corridor when he heard you at the door. That is possible. Things were pretty tense between Bartell and Lily Cole. Very. He was playing around with Jerry Lawrence and Lily was furious. Remember that. It might come in handy. Listen, Mike. When Bartell left you, you thought he was getting your money. Right? I was positive. He had a wall safe back there. Lily Cole would be likely to know that, wouldn't she? She could have been raiding the nest egg when Bartell walked in. Sure she could. I'll go out and see what she knows right now. Chin up. Hold tight and don't let anyone get you rattled. I won't. I feel a lot better now I've talked to you. Say, where can I get a key to Bartell's office? They took mine away from me Wait a minute. In my car in the hotel garage there is an extra set. Ahem. Why are you here? Looking for Bartell's money. I didn't find it. I guess the murderer beat me to it. Did you figure that out by yourself? - That was easy. Smoke? I don't smoke, thank you. Now, will you please go? You don't ever smoke? No. Not that it's any of your business. So you're not the woman who left a cigarette burning in the ashtray .. When Bartell cashed in his chips. You see. I'm the alert, watchful type and worthy of your confidence. If you have information, Mr Sloane, take it to the police. I'm not interested. You were for a minute. I can see that. - I'm uninterested in what you can see. Now get out of here. Alright, Miss Cole. By the way, do you happen to know the number of Jerry Lawrence's room? To save you the trouble, it is 841. I imagine I'll meet you there. Miss Lawrence please. Mr Sloane. Calling Mr Sloane. No, operator. No message. Here, boy. - Mr Sloane? Mr Travers is in Mr Bentley's room. He asks you to come up. Thanks. - Thank you. Hello boys. What's up? - Bentley picked up a lead. At least I think it's a lead. - Red hot too. Look, Joel. Bartell was heavily in debt to a fight manger named Ed Connors. Connors got into town yesterday. - The guy with Bartell at the station? Suppose he saw Bartell was skipping out and came down here to turn on the heat? Maybe he turned on the heat a shade too strong. Mr Connors please. Hello. Yes. This is Connors. Alright then. Come on up. A cop from New York. He's coming here. You get in the other room. - Alright. Remember. If either one of us was spotted at Bartell's place yesterday. We have to alibi each other. Okay. Go inside. When you hear him come in, sneak out to the hall and beat it. You go ahead, Sam. Hello Sam. What are you doing down here? Come on in. - Thanks. Good evening, Miss Lawrence. My, you move quietly. Hello Mr Sloane. I gather you just left Mr Connors' suite. No. That is .. What do you want? To talk with you. A few questions. You've no authority to question me or anybody else. Now get out of my way. Gladly. You smoke Plymouths. Any chemist can tell me if the lipstick on that cigarette matches the stain .. On the cigarette burning in Bartell's ashtray after he was killed. No. Please. I can't talk here. Not now. I've no time for stalling. A friend of mine is in the jug with a murder charge jammed over his ears. Come here. This will do. Sit down. Miss Lawrence, we both agree you were with Bartell when Mike Stevens came in. Yes. But .. Yes? Yes. This is room service. A steak sandwich in 842? Very good, sir. Right away. Where did you go? Mike said Bartell was alone when he saw him. Eric sent me away. He didn't want me to be seen. I went out of his office into the hall. - The hall? Not into .. Yes? You want that steak medium? Very good, sir. You didn't go to Bartell's private room when he sent you out? No. I went straight back to my hotel. Yes? Yes, I'll give you plenty of onions. Bartell planned to leave the country. He had tickets for two. I did not know that. I guess that other cabin was for his baggage. I won't tell the police about this if you play ball and tell me the truth. Where did Bartell have his money hidden? I know nothing about that. I've told you all I know. If you asked me questions all night I couldn't tell you anymore. I'll have another talk with you later on. If you still hold out on me I'll see you in jail if I have to build one for you. Hello? Your steak sandwich? Alright. You are going to get it. Hold your horses. Don't get tough about it just because you're a guest. What? Come in here and say that and I'll push your face in. Yes. You. I don't care if you are eight feet tall. Yes. I'll wait right here for you. Sorry, sir. Something you want, sir? No, no. Come right in. Make yourself at home. Say buddy, where's room service located on this floor? Room service? Right down there. Okay, thanks. I've had three hundred fights. What is your racket? Come on in. That's pretty. Who's this monkey? - A friend of mine. He says he hasn't seen Bartell since they met at the station yesterday. Is this the money Bartell had? - No, it is not. Yeah. That is part of it. - What are we waiting for? Look, that's my money. Bartell gave me that and I can prove it. Start moving, Connors. - Where to? In the general direction of the Police HQ. Look, chief. What right have these phonies got to search me and bring me here? It was my idea, chief. Travers was just helping out. A smart guy, huh? When Lily Cole gets here you'll wish you were dead. I bet you can arrange that too. - Shut up. Both of you. Connors, you say Bartell owed you money. How much? Twenty grand. He gave me that on account. Sorry to bother you at this hour, Miss Cole. Sit down. Something has to be settled right away. - Get to the point. These apes jugged me because they found $5,000 of Bartell's money in my room. Will you shut up? Now, Miss Cole. Did Bartell pay Connors this money? Yes. I was with Mr Bartell when he gave it to him. Thank you, Miss Cole. That's all. I'll take my dough now, chief. So, you big-town wise-guys. I could lock you both up. You know that, don't you? If you two interfere in this case again, I'll throw you in jail so far .. It'll take a week to get beans to you. Get out of here, both of you. Joel, is that you? Hello, dear. Where have you been? It's 2 o'clock. I'm sorry. That won't get you anywhere. Where have you been? Out gumming everything up. Travers in trouble with the local police. I am to be run of town on a rail and Mike Stevens is just where he was. That's my glorious record of achievement. You're trying hard for Mike, dear. He knows that. What's the use if I can't help? He is counting on me. You're tired, and I am depressed by everything that's happened. You go to sleep now and tomorrow you'll go out and knock them. I will try. The girls were cold tonight. Tomorrow I'll try Jerry Lawrence and Lily Cole again. Again? So that's where you've been all night you great big humanitarian. I had to, darling. They're both in this case. And you're out, as of right now. Don't you ever find a middle-aged unattractive suspect? They are just facts in the case, Garda. I don't see them as girls. A detective's first thought must be of his case. It's that second thought that worries me. Do you think they'll go on with the pageant despite this dreadful business? I hope so. You would. You and your tape measure. Our only chance to save Mike exists while the show is still on. Once the pageant's over and the people go, our chances of saving Mike are zero. I was only fooling, Joel. I want you to try to help Mike. But it would be nice if you could do it without fooling with bathing beauties. How would it be if I blindfolded you? Ah no. Then you would have to rely on your sense of touch. I'm going try to get a line on Jerry Lawrence. I'm sure she has Bartell's money and knows all the answers. Let me help. I'll take care of Jerry and you devote yourself to Mr Connors. Wait a minute. You keep out of it and stay right here. I'll be back for lunch later on. Hey. - What? Morning, brother. That proposition .. - No, brother. Brother, it's the chance of a lifetime. Once we get started it's all profit. Them lions hardly eat a thing. What's wrong with them? Can't they wear this year's style? But brother, please. Listen won't you. I got to talk to you a minute, captain. - What's the matter? My rent is paid. I know. I hate to trouble an artist. But get them lions out of your room. Show me where in the house rules it says I can't have a lion in my room. Morning. What's this about lions? - Good morning, Mrs Sloane. Say, if you were running a hotel, would you let a man have lions in his room? If they were married I guess it would be alright. Okay on the lions. But don't let me catch you with a woman in your room. Mr Clancy. It's like this. My husband left with both keys to our suite. I can't get in to change clothes. I'll go up with you and let you in. - No. I wouldn't dream of bothering you. You must have millions of important things to do. I'll bring it right back. That is against the rules. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Go on. I am counting. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. And I had a good job at the insane asylum. [ Buzzer ] [ Door knocks ] Sorry, Miss Lawrence. I didn't know you were here. I brought your dresses up. [ Telephone ] Now then, girls. Pay strict attention. When you walk, walk lightly. Hardly let your heels touch the ground. Now try it. That's right. Next. Miss Cole. I know. You're trying to help Mike Stevens and so am I. He has money invested in this show and I'm working to pull it through for him. I think Mike would rather lose his investment and keep on living. I've already told the police everything I know, Mr Sloane. Everything? The fight you had with Bartell over his interest in Jerry Lawrence? Don't talk such nonsense. Nothing like that ever happened. I've nothing to hide in this affair. I'm not involved. Nobody is, apparently. Eric Bartell didn't die a natural death. Somebody put a bullet in his back. I know all that. - And a lot more, I suspect. Look, Miss Cole. Mike Stevens didn't kill Bartell. The murderer is loose and you're helping him cover up. Or her. The orchestra leader wants to see you about the music, Miss Cole. Thanks. I will be right out. Here, you. Hurry up and get out of those clothes. We haven't got all day. Of all the nerve. - See here. Let's see your legs. If that's the custom of the country. I vouch for my wife's legs, professor. - Well .. I thought I told you to stay home. - Joel, I learned something important. That guy almost did too. Come on over here. Joe, guess what? - I forgot. You want to see the dressing rooms. They're right downstairs. I want to see any dressing rooms. Don't tell your story to the whole world. What have you been up to? - I searched Jerry's room. And I found .. - You did what? Do you mind if I show my wife around? She's never been backstage. Go right ahead. - Thank you. This looks like a storeroom, darling. Maybe we'll have some privacy in here. Come on. Explain yourself. Joel. I want to help and I thought it a good idea to search Jerry's room. So I did. - How? I rub this little ring on my finger and right away I become invisible. Here. Take a look at this. Miss Lawrence was all set to leave the country. She even had a passage booked. There is the name of her boat and her cabin number. Bartell was booked to sail on that boat. In the next cabin. Nice work, honey. Run that ring again and make yourself invisible around here. I don't want you mixed up in it. - Can't I work on the case a bit longer? I just bought a bloodhound to match my new suit. You can skin him for a neck piece. Joel, look. It's the stage elevator. Hey, up there. Stop it. Stop that elevator. We're caught down here. Joel, what will we do? - Keep knocking on that door. Open this door. Help. Help. Somebody come quick. Stop that elevator. Stop it. Help. Here, Garda. Hold this flame. Quick, Joel. Quick. Hurry, Joel. Hurry. Quick. Garda, where are you? Are you alright? Something fell on me. I can't move. Quiet. Everybody, please. It was just an accident. Someone threw the switch that runs the lift without knowing what it was. Sure. That was it. Forget it. Nobody hurt. I am glad about that. Come on, girls. Back on the stage. We've work to do. Come on. Get going. Joel, you know it wasn't an accident. Someone tried to squash us down there. Nonsense, Garda. Who would do a thing like that? What a vacation. Sorry, darling. Gee, I wish I could pull out of here now but I can't. I don't want you to do that, darling. Mike depends on you. Don't mind me. I'm just jittery. - You are a fine girl. Courageous, loyal, trustworthy. Stop reciting the boy scout oath. Dummy. Go about your business. - Alright. You go on home and hold the fort. Let no-one in without the password. That is the password. And if I catch you giving to anybody else, heaven help you. Who is it? - Sloane. I can't see you now. It's about your passport, Miss Lawrence. What about my passport? I have got it. Come in. Give me that. You've no right to it. I have no right but I have the passport. I'll tell you anything you want to know. Give it to me. Get dressed. Then we go up to your place and have a nice quiet chat. Mice? You did this. This is how you got my passport. Hand it over or I call the police. Go ahead. Call the police. Tell them you were booked to leave the country with Bartell. You were there when he was shot and you know where his money is. Untrue. I don't know where he hid the money. But you found out when he went to pay off Mike Stevens. I then left. I had nothing to do with it. Yeah? I know. Connors. Ed Connors must have got the money. Eric knew Connors was after him and he was afraid. Connors was there when Bartell was killed. Yes? I saw him as I left. He was on the way in. That's something the police should know right away. Don't say I told you. If Connors find out .. Don't worry. Give me my passport. I told you everything. You'll be tempted to drop out of sight if I give it to you. Please give it to me. Please. - I'll keep it for you. It'll be safe. What do you think you're doing? Get out of here. You let her get away. Sure, with you throwing punches. I heard all that stool pigeon told you. Every word was lies. Really? I wasn't in Bartell's office but that double-crosser was. She tried to frame me because she's in it up to her ears. What happened to Bartell's money? - Jerry got it. I am positive she got it. I was just going in to see Bartell when I saw her come out. The next minute the street was full of cops and I lammed. Yeah? That is true. If I had Bartell's money do you suppose I'd be tearing up this place? No. I suppose not. They certainly gave it a good going-over. By the way, did you find the money? - No. I said I didn't find it. I don't suppose you'd let yourself be searched? If you know what's good for you, you won't try it. Pardon me. I get off here. Keep watching me. I'll point Sloane out. He's bound to be here. I don't care if you get him coming or going but get him. Okay. Girls, it's almost time for the overture so for goodness sake .. Be ready when called. And you mothers, keep back out of the wings. Good luck, girls. Remember what I told you. Good luck, Emmy Lou. You're the guys I want. Has Jerry Lawrence come in? She's in her dressing room. - What's up? Come over here. I want to talk. I have a theory that Jerry got Bartell's money and knows who killed him. If she knows the killer, why keep quiet? The money. She loses it if she talks. That much money makes a very effective gag. And how. What I must do is make up a case against her. Anything to scare her enough to make her talk. Not me. I won't take part in a crazy scheme like that. Get a set of fingerprints. Anybody's. On a regular police department form. I've got a set on Bartell, but Joel .. - If it all goes wrong, say I stole 'em. Where are they, Sam? - Out in my car. Step on it. Stick by me, Ted. You'll be in journalism's hall of fame. I've a hunch this will work. - I hope so. So do I. The overture is just about over. Are you ready? Is the name right? Florabelle Higgins? - That's right. Looks to be starting. Let's go to the wings to watch the show. I've a hunch the big bathing-beauty mystery will soon be solved. I only hope I don't cause any bloomers. - So do I. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's now my privilege to introduce. Miss Florabelle Higgins. Miss Tulsa, Oklahoma. She ought to be Miss Tulsa. She's built like an oil well. Here are the fingerprints. - Thanks, Sam. These are fine. If the chief of police hears of this you won't see daylight for a long time. The chief won't know of it until I wrap up the case and lay it at his doorstep. I expected to be questioned by the police or anybody with authority. But this fellow Sloane is just a nobody. What right has he to search my room? Did he do that? He certainly did. - He won't do it again. Who is it? - Sloane. May I come in? Yes. Of course. What's the matter? - Plenty. I came to give you a chance to talk before it's too late. These fingerprints are yours. They came off the safe in Bartell's private room. Where the money is kept. - Not true. Give me those. Fakes. I thought so. - What of it? Chief, that girl was in Bartell's room when he was killed. I'm positive, you have to .. - I know what I must do. I am going to do it and you won't like it. Listen, chief. Believe me. You'll only find Bartell's money or murderer through her. Even if I believed all that and I don't. You'll do a little stretch for this night's work. You haven't got a jail big enough to hold me. Is my husband in there? Alright, Sloan. You're free. This lady furnished bail. I'll stay here if it's all the same to you. Come on, buddy. Get a move on. This ain't no hotel. Go on, say it: 'I told you so' and all that. Go on. I'm looking for that prison pallor I hear so much about. You wouldn't get it in two hours anyway. You aren't mad? You haven't got a horse whip? I couldn't get one. All the stores were closed. You're a crazy reckless, idiot but you're mine. See. They're not home. Everything is alright. Don't you worry. All we have to do is take the lions from the elevator and bring them in here. I ain't never been no chambermaid for no lions before. Captain, I don't like it. The ten-spot I gave you is just a start. If this guy comes across. He will after he sees the act. There's a C-note in it for you. I don't know. I am scared. Scared? Of my lions? They wouldn't hurt a fly. Oh yeah? Why do you carry a gun? That? That's for the act. A cue. When I shoot it they go into their routines. Captain, I'm going into my routine right now: that way. Wait a minute. Look. If you help me there's a job for you with the show anytime. With a uniform trimmed with gold. 24 carat. 28 if the show is a hit. Open the door. [ Lions growling ] You open it. Come on. Right out. Come on, boy. Sasha. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. You're sure them lions don't bite? Only when they're hungry. They sure look hungry to me. They should. They've not eaten for two days. Betty, come on. Sasha. Attaboy. Right inside there. That's the baby. Stop shaking. The lions don't like it. - Neither do I. Attaboy. Come on, baby. Right inside. Attaboy. We'll keep the lions in the bedroom. When Sloane comes in, we'll give him a surprise. I'll put those babies through their routines and they'll kill him. Come on. - No, sir. Lions is one thing .. I ain't going into no bedroom with. That's it, babies. Now be very quiet. Darn it. I forgot my whip. Quiet now. I'll be right back. Shush. Who's that lug? - Never mind him. Sloane is the one to get. - I was going to tell you. He left the show with the chief of police. So what do we do? Snatch him from under the cop's nose? Alright. He comes up here soon. You can get him then. What a day. I hope can stay awake long enough to get my clothes on. If you sleep through the bathing beauty contest tomorrow it's alright with me. I'm not that tired. - Oh no? If you were dead and a girl passed your grave .. Put up your hands. Go on. Get in there. - Step on it. What's the idea? - Shut up. My wife had nothing to do with it. - Shut up. Not a peep from you. Understand? Look in the bedroom. See if anyone's in there. Look. You can't fool me with those phony tricks. Look, you fool. - At the back of you. Maybe we'd better .. Go too. Do you think they would mind? Hold on to my coat, dear. - Right. Don't make a sound. - No. Hold on. Hold on. That's it. Here we go. I can give you a hand. Say, what's the idea? Why didn't you tell me you were a lion tamer? I can only break the case through Jerry Lawrence. If the police chief had the brains of a 4-year-old he'd see that. Operator X reporting, sir. I told you to go to the bathhouse and watch Jerry Lawrence. Obeying orders, I proceeded to the ladies bathhouse. That's as far as I got. Cops at every entrance. No-one can get in. Say, we're not through yet. They can't bring Mike to trial for another few weeks. By then you may have answers. Not if Jerry Lawrence skips the country. Believe me, Ted. That's what she'll do. But she can't do that while you have her passport. That's right. I have got her passport. Thank god I found this in Jerry's room. She has passage booked on The Panama with Bartell tomorrow. That's one date she won't keep. What is it, dear? This card in the passport. A parcel check from the railroad company. Sure. I wrote the name of the boat and Jerry's cabin number on it. I've been carrying this around in my pocket for two days. Look. This check was issued half an hour after Bartell was killed. That's how she hid the money. This is it. Wait until the chief of police sees this. Here goes Sloane in the home stretch. Wait for me. If this is one of your gags, Sloan, heaven help you. Not this time, chief. 30 cents due. Go and get it, son. - And keep the change. This will do it. That is money. - They ain't coupons. Where's Jerry Lawrence? At the bathhouse getting ready for the parade. Let's get her. Hi, chief. Don't let anyone in or out until I give orders. Yes, sir. What is the meaning of this? - I'm sorry to break in, Miss Cole. Where is Jerry Lawrence? - Getting ready for the beauty parade. Ask her to come in here. - But Chief. It's really very important. The chief's right. Gladys, call Jerry for me please. - Yes, Miss Cole. I hope you won't make it impossible for me to go on with the show. Jerry. [ Gladys screams ] What's the matter? What happened? - In there. Get a doctor. Quick. He has to be a an awfully good doctor. This girl is dead. Alright. Alright, Sloan. I admit I was dead wrong about Jerry Lawrence. But I still think Mike Stevens killed Bartell. And somebody stuck a knife in Jerry just for practice? That girl was murdered because she knew who killed Bartell. What's more, I know now who did it. You know what? I know who killed the girl and Bartell. Come on, let's go. - Sit down. It's not so easy. Chief, I want the use of that bathhouse tonight. And Jerry Lawrence's dressing room and an absolutely free hand. Okay. But you'd better be right, Sloan. Joel, that's your fifth since dinner and you haven't had dinner. You're nervous and upset. - Who wouldn't be? If I'd stopped to think I could have prevented that girl's death. Don't reproach yourself, darling. It wasn't your fault. No. But it's a rotten feeling anyway. All I can do now is try and save Mike. Can I help? - I'm afraid not, dear. All I have is a hunch. [ Buzzer ] Say, that's Bentley. I phoned him to come over. Hello Ted. - Garda, Joel. Hiya, Ted. You may get your story tonight. We're getting all the parties concerned into Jerry Lawrence's dressing room. You know something? Got a lead? Just hunches. Here. - Thanks. I figured if we all get together and talk it over we might get somewhere. Sounds a bit corny to me bringing them all together in Jerry's dressing room. I mean .. - Maybe. But it has psychological value anyhow. Sure. That's all the stuff. The criminal goes all to pieces at the scene of his crime. It does sound pretty silly when you say it in cold blood like that. Another? - No thanks. It's getting late. We'd better get started. I am all set. - For what? The meeting, dummy. You're not going to try to solve the case without me. I wouldn't dream of it, dear. Darling do you mind waiting in the cab? We won't be a minute. No, dear. Look. I haven't any money. Would you pay the cab? Alright. The chief turned this place over to me tonight. We'll have absolute privacy. Sorry. No-one allowed in tonight. - It's alright, officer. I'm with the gentleman who just went in. - Is that so? Mr Sloane said you were some babe he picked up in a shooting gallery. He did, did he? Yes. He asked me to get rid of you. Scram, sister. I just thought of something. Have you a gun by any chance? Never touch the stuff. Anyway, I thought you'd use psychology. It might come in handy if anything happened too quick for psychology. Come on, Eddie. You should be grateful I let you in on this and keep other newspapermen out. A scoop for you. Even if I strike out and nothing happens you get a scoop on that. So you know it's Jerry's room. You've been here before, haven't you. No .. what are you talking about? The papers printed that it happened in .. Dressing room 12. No they didn't, Ted. You found out when you killed the girl. Nobody but you knew I was closing in on Jerry. When I figured that out I got busy on the phone to New York. Jerry was your girl. But she threw you over for Eric Bartell. That finished Bartell. Jerry Lawrence saw you. You were afraid she might talk. That made her number two. There isn't any meeting, Ted. This was arranged for your benefit. I had an idea your foot might slip and it did. So we are alone. That makes it a lot easier. I slipped this in my pocket for luck. It isn't healthy to know too much, Joel. Ask Jerry Lawrence about that when you see her. Drop that gun! Well .. we got him. Yep. Garda. Are you mad, Garda? Don't you want to know who did the murder? I'll bet you do. Don't play dead with me. You're not asleep. Cutchie, cutchie. And if there's ever any favor I can do for you, captain .. Joel. Joel. Joel. That does it. ..f-s..
