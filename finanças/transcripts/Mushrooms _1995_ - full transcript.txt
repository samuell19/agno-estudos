(rooster crowing) (gentle music) (sea birds calling) - We here commit the body of our dear brother John to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who died, was buried, rose again for us and who shall change our mortal body, that it maybe be like his glorious body. Thanks be to God. (playful music) (police siren blaring) (people murmuring) - [Woman] Excuse me. (woman gasping) - You have a room available to-- - [Woman] I'm not sure if it's still-- - Upstairs is it? - Yes but. (lamp shattering) (sirens blaring) Oh wait! - I'm very easy to get on with no fuss, no bother. - Excuse me! - Quiet as a tomb. You won't even know I'm here. - Excuse me! Oh hey! No! - Very nice, very nice. Double scheme, oh yes, very tasteful. - [Woman] That's my room! - [Man] I need a room with a window. It's my condition, can't stand to be hemmed in. - Well, I'm sorry about your condition. This is my room, would you kindly remove yourself. (man grunting) - Ah! - [Woman] Someone at the door Flo. (knocking on door) - For rent. - Flo! (knocking on door) All right, I'll get it. (Flo grunting) - Catch your breath. (knocking on door) (door creaking) - [Woman] Yes? - Hello Minnie. Haven't been around to see you in a long time. But then there's been no reason since Jim and Albert went to that big pawn shop in the sky, eh? - Oh it's you is it, Sergeant? - Constable. - Still? - Just climbing the ladder, Minnie. Sometimes you gotta wait for someone to fall off. This is Detective Sergeant Instep, Minnie. New boy from head office. Gonna show us all how it's done. Minnie Halloran. - Shhh. - This is all that remains of a once thriving commercial empire. (guitar string vibrating discordantly) Did half my training in here. Used to be quite a regular. Every time a truck lost its load, we'd call around to see Albert and Jim. Who were always happy to assist us with our inquires, weren't they Minnie? Now, since the lads have had all their pawn tickets redeemed at once, well, nothing left but junk. Ah well. - We're looking for this man, Mrs. Halloran, name of Grubb, you seen him? - Come on Minnie look a little harder. - Ah, some of these would almost be collector's pieces I suppose. I mean, the right man would go out of his way to find a piece like that. Does it work? - [Minnie] Nothing in here works. - Well, I'm sure all she needs is a little tender loving care, soon get her to light up. - Would take skill and a certain amount of patience. - But she'd respond well, and be worth the effort. - Better off with a new one, less mucking about. - Oh no, give me the tried and true any day. - You have receipts Minnie, before Detective Sergeant Instep makes an offer, I'm sure he'd like proof that what he's buying is kosher. - I'll trust my instincts on this one, thank you Constable. - I think you'd better see a receipt Sergeant. - What? - A good policeman is always on the alert. Lateral thinking. Observation. Didn't they teach observation in your day? - No, no I don't know him, never seen him before. Has he done something awful? - Oh yes he has. - He might be able to assist us with our inquiries. - You'll let us know if he turns up? - I'll get on the phone straight away Inspector. - Sergeant. - Ah, well you certainly look like an inspector Sergeant. Sergeant? - Harry. - Minnie. - I'll think about the lamp. (playful music) You're looking for a lodger? Nip down to the station, get my bags, will you? - Your Joking. - Quick as you can, eh? Constable. (door closing) (water dripping) - Ugh, that's disgusting. (Flo gasping) You old diddle you. (laughs) - [Minnie] Flo, Flo, are you there? It's next to mine Sergeant. (giggles) - Uh uh yes Minnie. - [Minnie] Come out and meet Sergeant Instep. He's interested in our room. - I'm, I'm not dressed. - [Minnie] Well, hurry up then. - One word, just one word. And if they get me, they're gonna get you. Now get out there and get rid of him. - Oh, oh. - This is the room Sergeant. - Harry, Harry please. - A copper in this house? Have you got no respect for the dead? - Let them rest in peace, rest in peace. - Well, it's a nice big room. Catch the afternoon sun, wouldn't it? - Not much of a room Sergeant, you'll be used to better. It's a bit damp, gotta be careful at your age Sergeant. - Harry, this is Flo. Harry's looking for someone called Grubb. - Pleased to meet you. Reginald Grubb. Grubb by name, grubby by nature. You seen him? - [Flo] Uh no, no, never seen him. - Better off, he's a vicious bastard. - You know him? - Oh, just is his record and what he's been up to today. Well suit me fine. - He's a copper. - Come on Flo don't be silly. - Here's a hundred towards the first month's rent. - That's the bathroom. Cup of tea? - Oh yes please. - You hear that? Vicious bastard. You get out of here before he gets back. - You can get three years for shop lifting. Especially if you've had past dealings with the boys in blue. At your age, three years could be life. Beautiful room Flo. Now get rid of him. - Psst! Psst! Oh uh Minnie come here. - Gotta make the tea Flo. - Come here. - Harry's waiting for his cup of tea, Flo. - Forget his tea, come here. - Look, I'll just put the kettle on first, you go and take down the notice, will please Flo? - Notice? You and your bloody notice, just leave it there, we could be running a boarding house by nightfall. Maybe we can score a detective inspector or a superintendent. - Don't be silly Flo, the room's taken. Just go and get it. I've gotta make the tea. - You put it there, you get it. I will make the tea. - Oh come on Flo, go on. - Ask Harry to do it, I'm sure he'll understand. (playful music) (Minnie breathing nervously) (lock clicking) (Minnie gasping) - [Grubb] You wonderful woman. - Thank you Flo, very good of you, bring the tray. - He's here, he's, come back here. - That's Flo's Albert. Sit down, you must be tired, out investigating all day. Oh, I'll be mother. This'll fix you. - Very kind of you Minnie and Flo. Yes, I must admit I am used to a less strenuous and more scientific mode of investigation. - Sugar? - No, no thank you. - Sweet enough already, eh? - We're out of milk Minnie. Why don't you nip out and get some? - Oh, not on my account, please, black's fine. - Flo's just been out doing a bit of shopping, haven't you Flo? - Well somebody has to. - And she forgot the milk. (laughs) Nevermind, you can pick it up next time. Yes, a man like you would be wasted pounding a beat Inspector. - It's Sergeant! Sergeant. - Yes, sergeant, and proud of it. Brains before brawn, that's my style. Detection, a rag and a bone and a hank of hair. A footprint, a fingerprint, the pure and eloquent blood. Tools of the intelligent copper. But I mustn't bore you ladies. - Oh no, I love to hear a man talk about his work. - You're a bit old to be in lodgings. A room, a bed, a chair, a man of your age usually has a home to go to. I suppose you won't be staying very long though, will you? Passing through. - Oh. - I mean people don't stay very long in lodgings do they? - No, I suppose not. Well, I had a home, but cut all the strings, sold the house. Been pretty empty since my Nell. Too many memories. I was going to get a police digs, but they they're full of policemen! - Still, you wouldn't want to lose them. The memories. - No, no. But I needed a change, new faces. Got myself a transfer. Always wanted to live near the sea. I'm gonna like it here. (playful music) - Gifts from our husbands. - Our late husbands. (knocking on door) - Oh, that'll be my bags. Excuse me. - He's upstairs. The one in the photo, Grubb. - What? - In my room, he won't get out. - Well what's he doing there? - Well he wanted a room and he saw your damn notice. (Minnie sighs and tsks) - What'd you do that for? Bringing a criminal into our home. You better tell Harry. - You're crazy! You're darling bloody Harry is a policeman. - I know that, that's why you should tell him. - He'll tell them about my shopping. Look, he gave me all this. - Well, go up and get rid of him, quietly, before Harry finds him. - Me? I didn't want a lodger! - You can't steal electricity Flo, or gas, or water. Ye? - Mm? Mm, no. - Now, you go up, give him his money back and tell him he'll have to go. - Well, back again. - Another cupper Harry? - Oh no no, this is fine. (playful music) (thunder rumbling) - Right. - What time is it Minnie? - Sunset Flo, I don't know what time it is. - Would you look for me please? - Soon Flo, soon. Now, tell me what you can see, out there. - I'm watching the sun go down. - Is it a good sunset? - Come and look for yourself. - Now, now, Flo, I don't want to see it. You know I don't. Now tell me. - It's a moderately good sunset. It has some clouds to make it interesting, but not so many as to make it dark. There's a wind, but the clouds do not appear to be moving. I think it's cold. - [Minnie] How long before darkness? - Be dark later. - Will it rain? - I don't think so. Not before sunset. There's a man. - Is he big? - [Flo] He can't see us, he's too far away. - [Minnie] Is he coming this way? - I think he'll turn at the corner. Has a hat on, cap, don't know what color. All the colors look the same. And a long coat, his hands are in his pockets. Now, now he's gone the other way. He looks tired. - He'll be going home from work. Home to his wife and child. - Or to his rented room, he's probably living in somebody else's house, parasite. (Flo sighing) Your Jim liked to sit here. There's a mark on the sill where he rested his pipe. Perhaps we should have it painted, the sill. - [Flo] You're making a fool of yourself Minnie Halloran. Throwing yourself at him at your age. - [Minnie] At my age, what have I got to lose? Might never get another chance. - [Flo] Anybody's, anybody's always the same. - [Minnie] That's rich, coming from you. - [Flo] That was a long time ago. And a copper. - [Minnie] Can't keep a good girl down. (microwaves buzzing) Harry, dinner. Saves dishes. - Does that heater work, up in my room? - We've been meaning to get that fixed. - Don't give it another thought. I'll have a go at it. Save ya a few bob. - Hm. - [Harry] Ah hah. - [Flo] Well, I don't like him up there, poking about. He's a copper. Copper's poke about. Never know what he might stick his copper's nose into. (gas hissing) And that other one. We've lost half this house in one day. - Piece of cake. I'll just say good night, ladies. I'm up early tomorrow. - Wouldn't like a cupper, Harry? I could defrost something for your supper. - Oh, keeps me awake. - I'll remember that. Don't worry about Flo, she'll come 'round. - Good night. (meloncholy music) - Minnie, when did you last change these sheets? - I wasn't expecting company. Been a while since you've been in this bed, eh, Flo? Better company last time. (Minnie giggling quietly) (gas hissing) (birds calling) Tastes funny, dusty. - Nonsense, nothing wrong with it. It feels very strange not wearing knickers. I don't think I've had my knickers off for so long since before Albert died. Long before Albert died. Long long before. - There was a time when you'd get in and out of them at the drop of a hat. - Oh! Not me, Minnie Halloran. - Anyway. You didn't have to wash them. - Walk around dirty, no thank you, no thank you very much. - You could have borrowed some of mine. - There's a limit Minnie. - [Minnie] Never know it. You've borrowed what's mind before. - Let it rest. - Well you make sure you let it rest with Harry too. You have to get rid of him, before Harry gets back. Do you want me to come with you? I suppose he's still there. He might have gone at night. Oh hoho, you sure you didn't just make it up? Wishful thinking, eh? A man in your bed? Or to get rid of Harry, I wouldn't put that past you. (knocking on door) (Minnie inhaling) Can you smell gas? - That'd be loverboy, our friendly neighborhood police, master detective, plumber and gas fitter. (knocking on door) (door creaking) (women coughing) Open a window. (women coughing) - [Minnie] He's dead Flo. - Oh nonsense, not in my room, he's asleep, that's all. Come on, don't be so silly. Come on, wake up. - I know dead, I've seen dead, he's dead, he's dead. He's just lying there still. He's not moving, on the bed, dead, dead. On your bed Flo, he's dead on your bed. Just like Albert, on his back. That's a lovely dress Flo. - Your Jim gave it to me. - I knew. - Yes, I suppose, I knew he wouldn't keep it from you. I need it you see. And it made me feel alive again. And Albert wouldn't have bought, well, not then he wouldn't anyway. And it was a lovely dress, lovely. - And you look lovely in it. - Well thank you Minnie. Ruined now. - Oh, it's been so long since there's been a man in this house. The gas Flo. Reminds me of your Albert. In exactly the same spot. - Nothing like Albert, Albert was a gentleman, clean. - Yes, yes he was. - Didn't even take his boots off. (phone dial scraping) - What are you doing? - [Minnie] I'm calling the police. - Police, please, no more police. I just wanna report it, you've gotta report a death Flo. - Think about Minnie, think about it Minnie. - But you've got to report a death. - They'll snoop, they'll poke about. They'll investigate, they'll ask questions. What about all this frozen food, ma'am? And two television sets? Two refrigerators? Two video recorders? And what about all this silver, hm? And what was this criminal doing in your house? They'll think we killed him. - No, no we didn't do it. - They won't believe us. - But you've got to report a death, Flo. We reported Jim's and Albert's. - They'll arrest us you silly old bat. - An unsubstantiated sighting. - Unsubstantiated? - An unsubstantiated sighting. - You called 'em off too soon. - I suggest you leave the deployment of my men to me, Sergeant. - Another day and we'll have him. - Out to graze. How long have you got? Six months? Well let me spell it out for you, though God knows you should know by now. I have the best figures in the metropolitan area. - Congratulations. - Then an unsubstantiated sighting puts Grubb on my patch. I think our informant made a mistake. What do you think, Harry? I don't expect you to achieve anything Harry, but you had better not repeat old mistakes. This is a small community here. I know everybody. Everybody knows me. We're friends. I have taken a long time to establish this rapport, we have worked out a protocol. - Protocol? Nice word. - We don't make waves. We forget Mr. Grubb. He's gone, no longer my problem. - [Constable] Cup of tea? - Protocol. Take a note, Constable, protocol. We don't make waves. - Thank you Harry. Sergeant Instep was a great help to me when I was a constable, Lynch, I'm sure you'll benefit from working with him. - Settling in nicely. - What? - Moved in with Minnie Halloran and Flo Smithers. - Instep? In that house? (laughs) Silly bugger. Don't waste my time. (gentle music) - Bury him, out in the back. - Oh sure, you on pick, me on shovel, by the light of the moon with ghosties and ghoulies and things that go bump in, in the night. - Well, we've got to get rid of him, it. We've gotta take him away somewhere. Before Harry gets back. What's he gonna think of a woman who kills a lodger? - Copper in the house. Where? - Anywhere. A river? Tip? - Mm mm they'd find him, it, and how anyway? I couldn't lift that. - Well, leave 'im. Leave him there until he just goes a way. - That is my room. - Till he just fades away. - Have you any idea how long that would take? - Old soldiers never die, they just fade away. - All my clothes are in there. That's my room. - All right. All right. Come on. - Minnie! - Come on. Come on, before Harry gets back. We'll have to do it in the bath. Little bits, little bits. Cut off. - Bit at a time. In our handbags? - In our pockets. - Under our coats. - Wrapped up like parcels. - Gladware back in the supermarket. No, no. - Come on. (ladies grunting) Well, let's get rid of that first. Hold it across the board. - No, no, really you don't, - Take his arm! Now stretch it tight. (Flo gasping) That's the way you do it, a nice clean cut. Flo, just try to think of it as beef, Flo, or lamb. Just like in the supermarket. Right, turn him over, let's do the other one. When I was eight years old, my father slaughtered my pet lamb. I'd only ever seen him kill chickens before. Never a real animal. (knife thudding against wood) Right. Sling them in the sink and let's get on with it. Get his shirt off. Shouldn't be too much trouble now. Of course it wasn't a lamb anymore. Fat smelly old gram, chicken blood though he was. Always in trouble with the rest of the flock. Had to go. Big nice roast. Now I think I'll start with loin chops followed by spareribs. - [Flo] Oh. - Somebody loved him. He's got good thighs. Such a waste. Turn him over. Few T-bone, some chunk, not roast. - What about those bits? - We'll probably have enough left over for a few pound of mince. - Manly bits. - Considered a delicacy by some Flo. (electric knife whirring) - Hurry up, darling Harry will be back soon. I'm not going alone. - No Flo, you'll be all right, go on I'll put the kettle on. - [Flo] You are coming with me. - Go on, you'll be all right. - Put your coat on! (train whistle blaring) Come on now. (Minnie whimpering) Stand big. - Excuse me ladies. I think one of you must have dropped this. - Thank you officer. - Nice leg of lamb is it? Somebody's in for a good dinner. - She's so forgetful lately, I can't let her out on her own at all. (train whistle blowing) - Don't move. Soon as one passes. (train wheels clacking) Throw the bloody thing! Hurry up. No, no stop! (train whistle blowing) (bell on door ringing) - Close the door, close the door. Can't do that again Flo. What are we gonna do with the rest of him? - Thought I heard someone, come on through, I've got a present for ya. (chickens clucking) Nothing like fresh eggs. Nell and I always kept a few chucks. I hope it's all right? - Yes, of course it's all right. It's a great idea. Isn't it Flo? Flo? Flo? - A good detective gathers information and applies logic, clear thinking and deduces. Deduction and science. What they can't figure out from what you vacuum up off the carpet or scrape off a shoe. Or if you'll pardon me, recover from the contents of a stomach. And they'll come back with the criminal's age, his height, the color of his hair and his maternal grandmother's address. (chuckles) (melancholy music) (chickens clucking) - [Minnie] Just a little something to keep you going. - Oh thanks. (bell on door ringing) (Minnie humming) - Harry's gone. He said, that's why they were after him. - We can't spend it. - Why not? - Because he'd be waiting, your bloody Harry. Waiting for someone to spend up big and then he'll pounce. - No he won't. No he won't. - No! No! - I need a new coat. - You? What for? No, no! You only go out to church. No, no. Don't you touch it! And don't you let that copper in here. (chickens clucking) (Harry grunting) - Don't you nag me Jim Halloran. Don't know where you get the cheek. Don't you try to put the blame on me. No, I'm not taking any of your nonsense. (Harry chuckling) And now you're dead and it doesn't matter. Long time dead. - It's all right Flo, she doesn't miss it.

And we pray that we who eat and drink them, in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, in obedience to our savior Christ in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his body and his blood, who on the night that he was betrayed, took bread, when he had given you thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples saying, take, eat, this is my body which is given for you.

After supper, he took the cup and again given thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying drink from this all of you, this is my blood, of the New Covenant which is shed for you and for many, for the remission of sins.

Oh sorry ladies. - We know what it is to lose someone. I'll carve. (electric knife whirring) - And tell me Harry, how's the investigation going? The fellow in the photograph, the one you were looking for? Did you catch him? - Well, not exactly, but we needn't bother about him anymore. You see, oh maybe I shouldn't be telling you this, ladies, it's a bit nasty for mixed company. - Oh, go on, we'll be as brave as we can. - Well, you see, his hand turned up. Yes, cut off. Look, I'm sorry, I don't think I'll go on. - Go on. - Go on, we can handle it. - Well, both hands actually. I told Lynch it was suicide. Suicide by dismemberment. He believed me. Until I asked him how did he manage the second hand? (chuckles) Well, anyway the fingerprint boys got going on, the hands, and they identified him. So, it was almost case closed. Because you see, and this was the strange thing, the first hand, it turned up in a railway carriage in Brisbane, so naturally we thought he's headed north and met up with some of the hard men and that will be the end of it. He mixed with some unsavory characters. My boss said to me, don't make waves. - Sergeant-- - Sergeant Corris. - Detective Inspector Corris. But when the second hand turned up in a carriage in Alice Springs, I thought to myself, I must just give myself a pat on the back for this, this is where the intelligent copper, an experienced copper has it all over the new whiz kids, I thought to myself, Harry, where did those carriages come from? Adelaide and Sydney. Yes. Right. Now a younger man would have given up there. Lynch had. But I says to myself, how do they get from Adelaide and Sydney to Brisbane and Alice Springs? And I used the computer to find out. Brain versus brawn. Not the way my so-called superior officer organizes his investigations. Really, he calls himself a detective inspector. - So, how did they get there. - Ah ha! Along that railway line out there, and what's more, near as I can work it out, they passed each other, under that railway bridge. And you know what that means? It means that somewhere round here is his murderer. Did him in for the money, obviously. And all I have to do is wait until someone starts spending up and then I pounce. And that'll be it. Out with a bang. My last case, murder most foul. Best thing Grubb ever did, getting himself bumped off. But whoever it was was very silly to give us the hands. The hands! (chuckles) That makes me sure the murder's an amateur. Mind you, they are sometimes the most dangerous. - Allow me. - The fingerprints you see? There was still enough left to give us the fingerprints. We'd never have known otherwise, would we? - Would, um, I mean, If the hands of the unfortunate Mr. Grubb, was it? If they hadn't been found till much later, would you still have been able to identify him? - Oh no no, I don't think so. You see, a few more days in the heat and the process of, (Flo gasping) The prints would have gone, decomposed. We'd still have been able to tell it was human. A man even, rather than a woman. I mean it's not hard to tell human flesh from animal flesh. That would have been about all. - Oh, you can always tell it's human? - Yes, oh yes, yes. - Fine piece of pork like this wouldn't come cheap these days Harry. Mmm, you'll have to let us take it off your rent. - Oh no worries Minnie, I got it out of your freezer. The big one in the back room. Very wise buying in bulk like that. Save a lot of money keeping a well stocked freezer. I suppose you must buy a whole carcass at a time. But you really should label each cut. It's lucky I know my meats or I might have cooked it up as a leg of lamb. Wouldn't have tasted right with mint sauce. (laughs) - Poking about, sticking his face into everything. It's a wonder he didn't pull out the head. Scientific police work, pork, pork! What are we going to do? - Even if he knew, he wouldn't shop us. - Wouldn't he just? He's a copper. Post them. We could post them. - [Minnie] Mm? - [Flo] Him, it, legs and bits and things. - Who to? - To whom. I don't know. Anybody. - [Minnie] Was a nice bit of pork, when it was pork I mean. - [Flo] I only wish I knew the last time it was washed. - I don't suppose we could eat it. No, no. - Of course if we did eat him, then they'd never find it. - I was only kidding Flo. - [Flo] You heard what he said, they can always tell it's human. - I was only kidding Flo, I didn't mean it. - But if it's inside another human. - No, I can't eat that. (chickens clucking in the distance) - No, but his bloody chucks can. And we eat them and their eggs and it'll all be inside us. They'll never know the difference. (jovial music) - [Minnie] They won't be able to eat it all. - Give them time. Burn this lot back in the freezer. Oh, what about the head? - [Minnie] All under control. (bone cracking) - You wouldn't have any bicarb, would you? (Minnie giggling) Oh, smells good. (soup bubbling) Nummy grub. That roast was a bit rich, I'm afraid. You're working very late. - Oh you know how it is. We like to finish what we start. (laughs) (Minnie giggling) (gentle music) Don't rush me big boy. I gotta help Flo. (electricity snapping) - [Flo] I didn't expect you back. What's wrong with loverboy? Are there anymore? Must have been proud of his teeth to take such good care of them. - Must have had a good dentist. - What are we gonna do with them? - Pop them with Albert. - No, no, don't know where he's been. Pop 'em in with Jim. - At least we know where he's been. - What a terrible waste. I've got gold teeth. If I go, would you like to make them into a ring? Nice gold ring. - [Minnie] No thank you Flo. - I'm fed up with him sneaking up on us. You'll have to get rid of him. - No, no, Flo, I'm sorry you don't like him, but you haven't given him a chance. He didn't know it wasn't pork. - He's a copper. Dirty, snooping interfering copper. God, I wonder about you Minnie. You've always been strange about men. - Me? Me? (scoffs) I just like them. I don't make a song and dance about them, not like some people I know, bloody holier than thou, airs and graces. Just lay off. He's a nice man and he's, he's very fond of me. - Fond of you? He's on to good wicket, board, lodging, you thrown in for good measure and he'd shop you in a minute. Fond of you? Hah! What a laugh. - What would you know about it? You wouldn't know how to love a man properly. Poor Albert, no wonder he - He what? Come on, what? (wet towel slapping) (Mexican instrumental music) (door slamming wall) - Uh, (bedsprings crunching rhythmically) (rooster crowing) - Burglars, we had a lot of burglars lately. - Stealing food? - Oh it's Flo, she worries. (chickens clucking) - Morning Flo. What happened to all that nice stuff you were cooking up last night? - Oh we burnt it. Yes, burnt it, mmm, shame. (jovial music) (chicks cheeping) (chickens clucking) (Harry grunting) (roots tearing) - Your roses are starving. Chicken manure, nicely aged, great stuff for roses. - No, no we're saving it. (Flo moaning) - Better get in out of the sun. - No, no, I'll be all right. I feel fine, thank you. Thank you, Harry. (chickens clucking) (chickens clucking and flapping wings) (Flo grunting) (Flo moans) (Flo weeping) (Flo grunting in effort) - What an awful lot of eggs Flo. I'll give some to Harry to take to work. - No. God, you still don't get it do you? We've got to eat them ourselves. No no, otherwise you never know where they might end up. They might analyze them. And chickens'll be next. Chickens'll be next, - Shhhh! - I counted them. Got 27 hens. - 27? - I counted them. One sex mad rooster won't leave them alone and they're fighting and they lay eggs everywhere. I can't find the eggs in there. They start to hatch and there's more chickens. And I'm putting on weight and my clothes don't fit. And oh those eggs are doing terrible things to my bowels. And I, I, I, I, I didn't think about the manure. I didn't know what to do with the manure. I didn't think about the manure. (Flo weeping) - Shhh. I got you something special. Your favorite. - Oh kippers? - Mushrooms. - [Flo] Thank you Minnie. Thank you Minnie. Thank you Minnie. Thank you Minnie. Thank you Minnie. Minnie, there's a wedding on today. - [Minnie] Thank you Flo, that would be very nice. I love a good wedding.

Full circle. (knife scraping) (Minnie humming) - [Minnie] Flo, come here a minute. (chickens clucking) (rooster crowing) - As if never been. (knife thudding) Oh! (chickens clucking) - [Flo] Time we showed you what good cooks we are Harry. Specialty of the house. - Nice big drumstick for you Harry. You look like a drumstick man. (electric knife whirring) - [Harry] Anything, anything. - [Minnie] Some white meat for you Flo? - [Flo] Mm! (telephone ringing) - I'll get it. I'm expecting a call. Hello? - [Man] You were right, the teeth match up with Grubb's. - And the rest? - [Man] The blood, give me a break, I've only had three hours. Could be Grubbs. Hard one that, looks like poison. - Poison? - [Man] Still working on what it was. Something that attaches itself to the red blood cells and cuts off the flow of oxygen to the brain. Probably painless though. You never know. Could have been convulsions towards the end. Does that help? - Yes. Yes, thank you very much. I'm sorry, I've gotta go. - Oh, but we cooked a special meal for you. - I'm sorry, duty calls. - Well eat this as you go, at least you'll get to taste it. Hurry back. - He's up to something. He's up to something. (Minnie sighing) (waves crashing) - Are you feeling all right? - Yes, why? - You look a bit piqued. - Just tired. It's been a long day. Good night. (melancholy music) (knocking on door) - Are you all right? - I think so. - Come to bed. (mice screeching) (garbled radio voices) (computer keys clicking) (computer beeping) - [Constable] I think it's trying to attract your attention. (computer key clicking) - Don't make waves, I said. The hands were found in Queensland. Leave them there, I said. But no, bloody know-it-all has to pick at it. Now you've turned a simple case of larceny into murder. And on my beat. There are procedures. Right ways, wrong ways, protocol, Harry, protocol. Whatever he's been doing, you take over. You can't make more of a mess of it than he has. You do nothing, nothing. Sweet F A. In the unlikely event I think of something you can handle, I'll let you know. (door slamming) - Wouldn't happen to know the procedure for making a cup of tea, would ya Sarge? White? Two sugars. - Still an honest cop Nellie. Honest, not stupid. Not the same thing. Not the same thing at all. I know. Happy new year, still a sergeant. I had my chance. But I'm not stupid, I just couldn't live with it. So lay off Nellie. Leave me alone Nellie. That's the price of honesty, chasing nasty, vicious little men, using my brains, doing my job. No bribes, no favors. That's right. Till now. No I didn't. I didn't sell myself. Because Minnie didn't ask me to, that's why not. She let's me be. Don't worry, I can handle it. Two months and I'm off. A medal, golden handshake, my pension. A garden of my own, roses overgrown. Yes Nellie, I'm gonna buy a hundred rose bushes. Oh yes, at least a hundred. And do you know the last thing I did before I left? I planted a rose on your grave. Snow Queen, right on top of you. Virgo, Masquerade, Lady Isabel, Pretty Sally, Irena, Moulin Rouge, Crimson Glory, Orange Sensations, Scarlet Fire, First Love, Dorothy Perkins, Minnie Halloran, Minerva Halloran. Poor Scarlet, Mammatra, Kentucky Derby, Montezuma, Nevada, Chicago, peace, flow on Abbey. Minerva Halloran. Minerva Halloran! Minerva Halloran! But first ladies a toast to absent railways. I give you Reggie Grubb. Alas, poor Reginald I knew him well. More productive in death than ever he was in life. There are more things in heaven and earth, little chickies, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Or in yours, Florence Smithers. You didn't really think you could fool me, did you? Yes, you did. You see? They think I'm a mug. Well I am not. I am a detective. I worked it out. - Harry? - I don't think I'll ever eat chicken again. It has come to taste of the criminal classes. And as for mushrooms. - Harry, I'll die in there. - Congratulations ladies. A good job, well done. - There you are Sergeant. - Oh here comes the cavalry. I suppose the paddy wagon's parked outside. - Yeah, matter of fact. Oh, were you about to eat? - Yes, how about a bit of chicken, eh? Protein, brain food. - Harry, I'd never have believed it, I thought, you told me Flo, copper first, man second. - Copper? The Sarge? You're joking. I'm taking over all his cases. - You? - You have turned us over to him? - Don't worry Flo, I'm handling your case personally. - Case? Minnie and Flo? - Metaphorically speaking, of course. - Ah. - [Flo] Personally Harry? - Got a message for ya Sarge. From Corris, found something you can handle, he said. Just volunteered he said. That's you, volunteer. You're the new head of the social committee. - Social committee, he's a detective! - Detective, ah, come on. Might have been, once. That Grubb fella, you remember him, wouldn't ya? Sherlock couldn't catch him. Then he was killed up in Queensland, wasn't he? And the boss told him to leave it there, but no, he wouldn't listen. Happened here, he says, there's a murderer in our midst, he says. No one wanted to know. But he had to go and make waves, didn't he? Hmmm? And then he couldn't catch the murderer. - Rubbish. He knew he-- - Shhh. - Oh don't worry Minnie. I know when to move over, leave it to a better man. - No hard feelings then Harry? - No, no of course not. Have some more chicken. - You've been given a special assignment. A Chrissy party. - Party? - Mmm, always have a big do at Christmas. Corris says it's good for morale. Go down to the station and put up a few streamers. - Party in the nick, God help us. I hope you scrub the blood stains off the walls. - Corris says you're to apply scientific police work to it. Analyze the plumb pud, fingerprint a few turkeys. - Do you have to take that? - Oh, but Flo, isn't a party always a good idea? My table thou has furnished in the presence of my foes. - And my cup overflows. - Right, sure. - I didn't know you were religious Harry. - There's a lot you don't know about me Flo. (rooster crowing) - Well, best be on my then. Don't worry, I'll see myself out. - Thank you Harry. - Ahh it was brilliant idea. Better than the river or the bottom of the garden. You were game with me in the house. Two women alone with Regi Grubb. Justifiable homicide. Back in a minute. - Oh but we didn't kill him. He switched on the gas. - Leave him alone. We used to have good parties here once. (chickens clucking) (chicks chirping) - [Flo] Sorry, you're evidence, you've gotta go. (jovial music) - [Minnie] Soup, a nice chicken soup. - [Harry] And pate. - [Flo] And followed by chicken Diane. - [Harry] And dessert? - Oh uh, mushroom whip with a bit of chocolate. - Plum pudding. - Or chicken salad with caramel sauce. - No. No, plum pud, it has to be plum pud, it's Christmas. - [Flo] Oh you are scrubbing under the toenails, aren't you Harry? - A bit Flo, a bit. - What'll we call it? - Jon Dam delight. - Wallah, pate ala fwa Flo. - [Flo] Right, banyans and feathers. - Give 'em a bit of fiber in their diet. (jovial music) Oh. (laughs) (Christmas bells ringing) (dog barking) - Anything I want to know about? (ladies giggling) (thick liquid bubbling) - Um Minnie, Mrs. Halloran, Mrs. Smithers, Flo, this is Maureen, my intended. - Congratulations. - You sly old fox. - [Harry] You kept that one very quiet. - Lovely young couple. - When's the big day then? - New Year's day. - Well, congratulations Constable. - Detective constable. - [Maureen] We'll make an inspector out of him yet. - Sergeant, can have the makings of an inspector. Thank God. - This'll help ya get started in your little love nest. - Thank you Mrs. Halloran, that's very kind of you. Thank you very much. - You need all the help you can get. Look after him. But don't trust him, they're too easily tempted all down the years. - Don't stand under the mistletoe Harry. Policemen's wives, anything could happen. Gifts, for coppers? - It's Christmas, isn't it? - [Constable] Ah! Merry Christmas Jack. - Merry Christmas, Terrance. - Merry Christmas, Jack. This is Jack Corris. Flow Smithers, Minnie Halloran. - Oh, we know Jack Corris. Old friends, aren't we Jack? - Merry Christmas Sergeant. - Detective Inspector, Merry Christmas. - Oh my, you have come up in the world. - [Maureen] Merry Christmas Dad. Come into the garden. - I'll get you a beer Jack. - Keep your hands off him. - (scoffs) Minnie if I can't have an innocent conversation with the man, - You said that last time. Once you set your cap, you've got a grip like a bulldog. - They've been naughty girls, Minnie and Flo. Up to no good. - Harry. - And you never even noticed Sergeant. No wonder you're still driving a desk. Now now. - Harry. - Anyway, wouldn't wanna spoil a good party now would we? - Harry, I need to talk to you. - Yes, yes we need to talk - Rosie get back here. - About you and Flo. (pop gun firing) - Georgie! - Get back here. - Flo? - You carve Harry. - Merry Christmas Sarge. - Oh uh, you know more about this sorta thing than I do Minnie. - Tradition, man of the house Harry. Specially at Christmas. - Oh yes, don't mind me. - Merry, Christmas. (electric knife whirring) - Yes, but I, (electric knife whirring) (energetic music) - [Woman] Looks good, what is it? - [Flo] It's Jon Dam's Delight. Sergeant Instep's favorite recipe. (man slurping) (jovial music) - [Woman] Table manners of a herd of pigs. - I just came to say goodbye. - Minnie, now you're being ridiculous. - Harry, I'm leaving. - What? - Oh you know you wouldn't get over the step. - Lynch has been snooping around. He's got a warrant. - Lynch! Lynch, stuff Lynch! - But he's gonna arrest you! - [Man] Merry Christmas! - Dear God. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Bert. Minnie, Flo, this is Bert Wilson, our forensics expert. - Pleased to meet you ladies. (Flo grunts) Ah ah, tis the season to be jolly. Ra la la la la la la, - Here Bert. - Oh! And a wee drop of the water of life. CO, definitely CO. - What the hell's CO? - Carbon Monoxide gas. Domestic purposes, heating, cooking, things like that. - Elementary my dear Wilson. You wanna beer? - I sure do. Hey um, what's his name, caterpillar, you know. - Caterpillar? Grubb. - Right, I'm off. I turned the gas off. It was me, wasn't it? - What does it matter? It was an accident, who cares? - But all this time I thought it was you two. - Better off without him, you said it. No one will ever know. Oh goodbye! - The recipe for that stuffing. My Bill's raving about it. (Corris grunting) - Sorry Jack, I want a word. - Not now. - Minnie! Minnie come back. - You did it with Jim, now you're doing it with Harry. - I'm not after him. He's not my type. - Neither was Jim, look what happened to him! - Yes, Jim had a bloody good time. He chased me. - He didn't have a chance, he told me. - You believed him? He kept at me. - No! - Even for years! - And you hated every minute of it. - Minnie you know I did. Oh Minnie, Minnie where are you going? - Anywhere. - Without me? - I did fine before you came along. - That was 40 years ago! Oh Minnie, if anyone goes, it should be me. (head thudding against door) - Oh Flo. Flo. - Three into two won't go. - He's only a lodger. - Is he? Is he? - We have to get rid of him. (swords clanging) - Cut that out, stop it. - I still need that word, Jack. Lynch has a warrant. - Well, there's a first time for everything. - For the arrest of Minnie and Flo. They didn't do it, I did. I know I should have reported it, I know what that means, dishonorable discharge. But I didn't wanna make waves. - Doesn't sound like you Harry. - Oh come on Jack. They're just two confused old women. - Confused? Us? No, not anymore. - You stay out of this Minnie. - Don't you talk to her like that. - That goes for you too Flo. - [Minnie] Harry. - [Flo] Minnie has something she wants to say to you. - It'll have to wait. It was me, Jack, not Minnie and Flo. - Harry, what are you doing? - I'm just giving Jack a chance to get rid of me. - You used to be quite a regular here in the old days, Jack. Of course that was before you became important. Oh those were the days you'd call in for a chat. - Chat. - And Jim and Albert would, well, they were generous men. - [Minnie] And they were so modest about it too, discreet. - You really should educate that boy, the younger generation. - No finesse. Tell him the facts about police work. A proto, - Col. - [Minnie] How to make it to the top. - Discretion, loyalty, how to remember old friends. - [Minnie] Old friends who remember you Jack. - Oh we remember you Jack. Old friends make the worst of enemies, Jack. - If you know what we mean. And we're not as shy as Jim and Albert were. - [Flo] Two old women, you know how old women gossip. - Lynch! - Yes. - You have a warrant. - I was gonna surprise ya. - You never fail to surprise me. Give. Stolen goods. I never thought you'd sink so low, Harry. - Stolen goods? - Microwave ovens. - Microwave ovens? - Microwave ovens? - House is full of 'em. - Look dad. The same as yours. - Chew. Maureen. - Sir? - Such a fuss. - Oh something so small. - Only a man. - But three into two? - Arithmetic, I'm sick of bloody arithmetic. (people clapping and cheering) - [Minnie] Pity they couldn't eat the bones. - [Flo] Well, still evidence, isn't it? - [Harry] Well, you better get yourself some more chucks. - No! - No, not the eggs not again! - Worked wonders for you Minnie. Made a new woman of you. (Harry, Flo and Minnie chuckling) Anyway, I've got a better idea. Think of it as seed capital. (people chattering) (rooster crowing) (jovial music)
