[CRACKLING] Hey, what do you want from us? We're freezing here. MAN: Rosebud. NARRATOR: Over a century ago, in the foothills of the old river valley... ...there stood the village of Acme Falls. It was a town filled with happy inhabitants. - Including the butcher, the baker... - Oh. Hello. - Hi. -...and the candlestick maker. - Hi. NARRATOR: And a mime. Well, no place is perfect. NARRATOR: That's true, but Acme Falls was as close to perfect as possible... -...except for the mime, that is. - Right. NARRATOR: Now, this village was part of a peace-loving picturesque little country... ...called Warnerstock, which was ruled by a benevolent king... ...Sir William the Good. Everyone loved King William. [CROWD CHEERING] Peace and prosperity covered the land. But then King William passed away... ...and there was a struggle for control of the kingdom. [YELLING AND GRUNTING] And the struggle ended with Warnerstock being overthrown... ...in a hostile takeover by the nation of Tictockia. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Now, the new leader of Warnerstock was King Salazar the Pushy... [CROWD BOOING] ...a ruthless corporate raider who vowed to rule with a tight fist. But the international community didn't support his regime... ...and the country's fortunes plummeted. We're broke. NARRATOR: Salazar's treasury grew dangerously low. So he sent out an edict for the country to start turning a profit... ...or perish. To fill the royal coffers, all cities and towns were to be taxed... ...and this included Acme Falls. There, the king sent his tax collector... ...Baron von Plotz, who was taxing to the extreme. Uh, that's right, keep the line moving. Please give till it hurts. Next. [CHOMPING LOUDLY] - Well? - Forgive me, Baron von Plotz, sir... ...but I have nothing to pay my taxes with. You've taken my livestock, my land, my home, and left me with nothing to eat. Yes, yes, these are hard times. I can hardly keep the fire burning myself. Yeaw! Next. [MAN SOBBING] NARRATOR: The baron squeezed the life out of Acme Falls... ...until the once prosperous town was crushed. And so our story begins in the miserable little village of Acme Falls... ...with its pathetic band of down-trodden and destitute townsfolk. Oh, and a mime too. And three orphans who live on the street, ever since the orphanage shut down... ...Yakko, Wakko and Dot. [SINGING] Some folks say that life is cruel [SINGING] At the orphanage, they fed us inedible grue! [SINGING] We slept on beds with springs that hurt The faucets had hot and cold running dirt The windows were broken The roof was leaky The walls were cracked The floors were creaky They shut down the orphanage And now we know ALL: Ah... ALL [SINGING]: Those were the days, we miss it so And ever since then... SINGING [IN DEEP VOICE]: I've been feeling low Another sub-zero morning And still there's nothing to eat My feet couldn't get much colder Our breath is our main source of heat We're so far below the poverty line We're off the graph But don't fret, sibs Because things will get better in time - Then you're gonna laugh - Ha! [SINGING] Poverty and hunger abound here. [SINGING] Yeah, it looks like a city dump There's only one job to be found here The town needs a new speed bump [SINGING] Acme Falls was a paradise [SINGING] Happiest place on Earth ALL [SINGING]: But the tax collector's avarice Took us for all we're worth [SINGING] My coffers are overﬂowing ALL [SINGING]: All of our shelves are bare My profit margin is growing We're broke, it seems so unfair Life's so lousy we can no longer cope You gotta cheer up And never ever give up hope - All of the shops are closing - Things couldn't get much worse [SINGING] Even my nuts are frozen [SINGING] Be careful with that last verse Hey, step up and try our elixir It's good for what hurts - Whatever ails you it can fix, sir - And it's great on desserts [SINGING] Drat, the temperatures falling [SINGING] I love when the weather is cool A new ice age is calling Look, I can freeze my drool I have hopes and dreams of ruling the Earth But here I sit - Watching Pinky make ice sculptures - Out of spit, narf This old tree is finished Our acorn supply's gone too So for dinner We're having creamed spinach All I can say is spew BOTH: As a town, we're so down, so we mope You gotta cheer up And never give up hope ALL: We can't cope You gotta cheer up And never give up hope ALL: Are you a dope? - Nope ALL: Just cheer up And never ever give up hope Hope, hope, hope, hope Yeah NARRATOR: And so the folks in Acme Falls hoped through the winter. They hoped through the spring. They hoped through the summer and they hoped through the fall. But after a year of hoping... ...hope was running out for poor little Dot, who needed an operation. [DOT COUGHS] And while Yakko stayed behind to look after his sister... ...Wakko went out into the world to seek his fortune. [BOTH COUGHING] And the town waited for Wakko's return. They waited through the winter. They waited through the spring. They waited through the summer and they waited through the fall. And by the following winter, they were still waiting... ...when a young mouse's fancy turned to romance. PINKY: Oh, Pharfignewton. Pharfignewton. Wherefore art thou, Pharfignewton? [NEIGHING] Oh. Therefore you art. And lookie. Narf. I brought you a sneaky-wacky. [NEIGHING] Ha-ha-ha. Troz! Feeding you is like taking a really smelly bath.

Along with the fairies and the wand sprites and the bean sprouts. I stand corrected, Pinky. - That is a horse. You are an imbecile. - Thank you. -Now, come, we must prepare for tonight. - Why? What are we going to do tonight? Guess. - Try to take aver the world? - Bingo. - Egad! I love bingo. Narf. It's so much more fun than trying to take aver the-- Unh! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Yeah, including food. Try eating a solid gold turkey. Adios, bicuspids. SALAZAR: Ugh. I never realized this wish business was so complicated. Tell me about it. Ah. How about I wish for youth and beauty? Huh? Here you go. A kid and a horse. Let me put it another way then. How about eternal youth? That I could be 16 forever? Then you'd go back to being 15 and relive that same year over and over... ...and you'd have zits and no one would ever date you. Ugh, never. I know. I'll wish for a million bucks. No, make that two million bucks. Just be glad it's not mating season. [BELLOWING] Wait, I got it! What if I wish for all the dough in the world? Sounds good to me. [GRUNTING] Ha! Dough, heh-heh, like pastry dough. It's a joke. You get it? [SALAZAR GRUNTING] Yes. And now it's your turn to get it. Captain, take the Warners away and have them executed. Yes, sir. Our joke was funnier. [GRUNTING] Sorry to do this, kids, but it's my job. So let's get it over with. - Any last requests? - Yeah. Set us free. No can do, pretty missy. I have my orders. - Please, let us go. - No way, man. Forget it. Pretty please with whipped cream and a cherry an top? Whoa, man, you're working your cuteness on me, man! Your irresistible cuteness. Stop it. Wrong, wrong. Knock it off. Pleasy-squeezy-weezy-weeze? No! Fire! [GUNS FIRING] Ah. Music to my ears. Oops. Missed. How can we ever thanky-wanky you? Don't. You're free. Just no more of the thing of cute. We can't take it. ALL: You're too cute! Now go! It's a gift. SALAZAR: I could wish for everything in the world. But then, where would I store it all? Or maybe I could wish for a hundred wishes. I wonder if that's allowed. - Your majesty. - Yes? I'm afraid the Warners have escaped. What? But I told you to execute them. I tried, man. I really did. But the cuteness was too much, man. - They're too clever. - Just like their parents. Huh? Wha--? SALAZAR: I should've gotten rid of those kids years ago when I had the chance. At least now I know what to wish far. I'm gonna wish those annoying kids would leave me alone forever! [DOT COUGHING] No! [DOT COUGHING] - I can't make it. - Come on, Dot. We're almost there. Stop them! Fire! Fire! Fire! Yes! - No! - No! [BOTH GASP] [DOT COUGHING] Dot, can you hear me? - Tell me the story. - What? The story. About Mom and Dad. - Tell me. One last time. - You should rest. [COUGHS] Once upon a time, a brave knight married a beautiful princess. And they had two sons. But they wanted a daughter too. So they planted a garden. And out of the prettiest flower came... Me. YAKKO: And so Mom and Dad took you home... ...and every night at bedtime, they'd come in and say, "Who's the cutest girl?" - And you'd say... - "I am." And they'd ask, "How'd you ever get so cute?" - And you'd say... - "I was born that way." And they'd say, "Tell us your name." And you'd say... "Princess Angelina Contessa Louisa Francesca... [COUGHS] ...Banana Fanna Ba Besca III. But you can call me Dot." And they'd ask, "Can we call you Dottie?" - And you'd say... - "No. Just Dot. Call me Dottie and you die." [SOBBING] [ALL SOBBING] She's dead. - And it's your fault, man. - I-- I-- She was the cute one, man. The impossibly cute one. And new she's gone. You killed her, man. Wrong, wrong. I-- I didn't mean it. [GUARDS GRUMBLING] Really. It's just that they were driving me crazy. These two and-- Wait, where's the other one? Look! It's Wakko! No! ALL [SINGING]: He's gonna get to the wishing star -[SINGING] Stop him before he gets too far -[SINGING] Help me, spirit, wherever you are ALL: He's on his way to the wishing star - Wishing, wishing, wishing, wishing Wishing, wishing, wishing, wishing ALL: The wishing The wishing star I'm feeling better now. ALL: The wishing star She's alive, man. The cute one's alive. [ALL CHEERING] I guess those acting lessons paid off after all. - Do you really mean it? - No. Mr. Spielberg loves this shot. Nice job, Wakko. You've done well. The power of the wishing star is yours. At the sound of the tone, please make any wish you desire. Okay, here goes. I wish for... [ALL GASP] Not one, but two ha' pennies! They're real. [ALL CHEERING] No, no. [SOBBING] ALL [SINGING]: He's got two ha'pennies today He's got two ha'pennies, hooray No more worries or cares While it may sound cliché It's the answer to our prayers And no more taxes to pay Now it's back to the town of Acme To go shopping with his whole penny NARRATOR: And, as it turned out, Wakko had made the perfect wish. Because with one of his ha'pennies, he paid for his sister's long overdue operation. It was a complete success. [ALL CHEERING] What was the operation for, anyway? Plastic surgery, to implant a beauty mark an her cheek. I call it a cutie mark. Cindy Crawford, eat your heart out. So do I look cuter now? Your cuteness is, like, out of control, man. - It's perfect. - Perfect, huh? [YAWNS] Well, I suppose that'll have to do. NARRATOR: And with the ha'penny he earned from Dot's operation... ...Dr. Scratchansniff bought all the ingredients for his new elixir... ...which was mixed together by his crack team of beverage technologists. More sugar? Yeah. Yeah, more sugar, definitely. Definitely more sugar. NARRATOR: At the same time, Hello Nurse came up with a new bottle design... ...one with a slightly more attractive shape. It just came to me from who knows where. BOTH: Hello, Nurse! NARRATOR: Then they put their new formula to the ultimate taste test. Well? [BELCHES] That's a big thumbs up. NARRATOR: So while they went off to market with their new drink... Wakko went to town with his other ha'penny and he bought... [SINGING] Burgers at the butchers Blintzes at the baker's Groceries at the grocers Season tickets for the Lakers. [NICHOLSON GRUNTS] [BLARES] NARRATOR: That ha'penny changed hands all over town, and everyone prospered. - Including the butcher... - Hi! - ...the baker... - Hi. -...and the candlestick maker. - Hi. NARRATOR: And a mime. - Like we said, no place is perfect. NARRATOR: But Acme Falls was as close to perfect as possible. And thanks to Wakko's wish, other wishes came true as well. With the spring thaw, Slappy's tree came back to life. Ah, sweet bliss. [SQUIRREL GIGGLING] NARRATOR: And Skippy's social life warmed up considerably. Mm. [GIGGLING] Huh? Squirrel chicks. Yawzah! Uh... Yeah! He used to like nuts. New he's discovered dates. NARRATOR: Buttons returned Mindy to her home. WOMAN: Mindy, darling, you're back, you're safe. - Oh, thank goodness. - Hi, Mom. WOMAN: Aah. Mindy, you called me Mom! You called me Mom! It's a miracle! NARRATOR: And Buttons received his wish, to be rewarded for his loyalty. [SIGHS] NARRATOR: Rita and Runt's wish came true too. [RITA SIGHS] Life is good. Yeah, good. Definitely, definitely good. NARRATOR: They found a happy home with Dr. Scratchansniff... ...whose elixir was renamed Scratchy Cola and was a huge success... ...thanks to the corporation's savvy C.E.O. BOTH: Hello, Nurse! NARRATOR: Who was finally appreciated for her figuring, and not just her figure. Baron von Plotz achieved his wish too, to be king. Burgermeister king, that is. May I take your order, please? NARRATOR: He opened a chain of fast food restaurants... ...that sell Scratchy Cola and Baron von Plotz burgers. You want fries with that? NARRATOR: And Ralph, who ultimately wanted to direct, got his wish too. He's directing traffic in the village of Acme Falls. Uh, it's my dream came true. [CRASH] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] RALPH: Oops. NARRATOR: Even the pigeons, who wanted a little respect, got their wish. - There they are. - Our heroes. Those three are the best. Finally, people are looking up to us. NARRATOR: As for Yakko, Wakko and Dot... ...they wound up with more than they'd ever dreamed. The hospital tracked down their birth certificates... ...which proved the Warners to be of royal heritage. Works for me. NARRATOR: In fact, their parents had been the king and queen of Warnerstock. Making Yakko, Wakko and Dot the heirs to the throne. Faboo! NARRATOR: It seems that back when Salazar seized control of the nation... ...he sent the royal Warner orphans into exile... ...never expecting to see them again. - Aah! - Ha! Fooled you, didn't we? [GRUNTING] [DOGS SNARLING] [DOGS BARKING AND SALAZAR YELLING] NARRATOR: So King Salazar was officially booted out. And the Warner's became co-rulers of the kingdom. As for Pinky, he was appointed royal stable mouse... ...so he could stay close to Pharfignewton. [PINKY HUMMING] This job was given to him by the Warner's' most trusted adviser... - ...Prime Minister Brain. - Yes! Come, Pinky, we must prepare for tomorrow night. Gee, Brain, what are we going to do tomorrow night? BRAIN: The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Plan for the sequel when we'll try to take over the kingdom and the world! SINGERS [SINGING]: They're dinky They're Pinky and the Brain Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain NARRATOR: So in the end, everyone in Acme Falls got his or her wish... ...except for the mime, that is. I don't know about him, but that sure was my wish. ALL [SINGING]: The good old days were a bummer Our town was a total dive But now every day's like summer It feels great to be alive To state our message with greater clarity We now spin the wheel of morality Wheel of morality, turn, turn, turn Tel! us the lesson that we should learn And the moral of our story is... ALL [SINGING]: When you're blue Buy a clue, try not to mope You gotta cheer up And never give up hope Don't be a dope You gotta cheer up And never give up hope Try to cope Just cheer up and never ever give up Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope
