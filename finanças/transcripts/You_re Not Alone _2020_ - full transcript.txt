- I can't believe you're doing this. He's barely in the ground, and you're taking away the one thing he holds most dear. - It's not like you're giving me much of a choice. - You haven't even seen her since she was born. You are unfit to be anyone's mother. - The judge says otherwise. - The judge is an idiot. There must be something I can do. - As they were still married at the time of his death, uh, the transfer of assets is settled. The ruling also approves full custodial guardianship of Isla, as long as Emma abides by the court mandates. I, I'm sorry, Mrs. Walker. - I want you to know how much I love you. - Hi. I know it's gonna be a big change for you, but it's gonna be a big change for me too. And I want us to get along. I expected the place to have changed a lot more. Isla! System disarmed. Check it out! Our new house! Babe, come up! Come up here! See this view? This is us. Isla? I left some dinner outside your room. - It's okay! It's okay! You stay here, okay? It's gonna be fine. System disarmed. - You stay there. I'll be right back, okay? Hey, it's nothing, I probably just forgot to close it. See? It's just the two of us. Hello! Is anyone here? See? - There she is, there's my homegirl. - Oh, Ashley. - Hi. So, where's my special niece? - You know, she's on a hunger strike, barely said a word to me. - Ah, that bad, huh? Mm, she'll come around, just give it time. - Yeah, sure? - Of course. You're her mother. - Mark, what are you doing here? - I heard about what happened. I just want to express my condolences. If you ever need anyone to talk to or just looking for a friend. - Great, thanks. - Well, that was a blast from the past. - Yeah. Think she'll like them? - Yeah. Yeah, she'll like them, they look good. What was up with Mark today? - I don't wanna talk about it. Found some pancake mix in the cupboard. Figured they might be your favorite. Hope you like 'em. - Thank you. - What if it's too soon. What if she hates me for it? - Why don't we start with the little things? Keep the photos of Patrick, but as for the rest of this stuff, I mean, especially your room, no point in feeling like a stranger in your own home. - My home? - This is your home now, isn't it? - Patrick had so many plans for this place. He wanted to build a white picket fence over there. Just never got to it. - Yeah, no shit. - Isla, don't go in there. - Em, she's just a kid. Hey, so I gotta bounce. My shift starts in like an hour. - Mm. Thanks for your help today. - Yeah, of course. Hey. See you later, kiddo! - Do you need a ride? - I'm good. - First table meal together. Figured this would be a great time for us to get to know each other. You know dinner tables are a special place for people to talk about their day and, how do you feel? - I feel hungry. - I meant how do you feel about things so far, I, you know, I thought it'd be good for us to lay out our thoughts and stuff. - I saw something moving in one of the windows. - Oh yeah? What did you see? Bedroom's clear. You know what my mom once told me? That there are no bad ghosts. Just ones that are lost and need a place to stay. And sometimes, when it's rainy and windy, that's when you hear 'em. And this house has enough room for all of us. So there's nothing to be afraid of. Goodnight, Isla. - Emma? - It's okay, it happens sometimes when you have nightmares. - It wasn't a nightmare. - What is it? - No don't! - See? It's nothing to be scared of. - I'm concerned about her signs of aggression. - I don't, I won't. It must've been hard for you to hear about Patrick. What happened to him. Did attending the funeral help? - I don't know, I, I feel like there's so much more I wanted to say to him, and now I, I can't. - Letting go is hard, and with Isla reentering your life- - I know, but I won't make the same mistakes again, I, the two of us are already making progress. I really appreciate these sessions with you. - The judge placed a great deal of trust in this arrangement. It's important for you to be honest. - I will, I, I'm tryin' to- Doctor? - I saw you at dad's funeral. - You did? Come here. - You were sitting by yourself. - I know I wasn't supposed to be there, but I had to see him. - You miss him, don't you? - Yeah. More than you can imagine. - I miss him too. - I know. - Mr. Nibbles! Ya see, see, Mr. Nibbles! - Mrs. Willis? Remember me? It's Emma. You know Mr. Nibbles seems to be, uh, leaving some treats on my doorstep. You don't suppose he- - Mr. Nibbles! - Great. Two juice boxes should last you the day. There's five bucks for lunch, and I think, think you're good to go. Oh, I've got something for ya. You're a big girl now, so, this bad boy used to be my pride and joy in college. Only use it for emergencies. I've already keyed in my number. Well, how 'bout it? Your first cell phone. - The other kids can watch movies on theirs. - Right. Hey I'm so, so sorry. I got held up at work. Here. I'm sorry. - What are we doing here? - Do you like ice cream? There's this really cool place I used to go to all the time. - I thought I recognized that voice. - Mark. What're you doing here? - I just work up the street. I was, uh, on my way to lunch and I saw you. Hey, little lady. I'm Mark. What's your name? - Isla. - You know your mom and I used to come here all the time. - So you, uh, working now? - Yeah, yeah. They actually, uh, made me the senior tech advisor at the store on Second Street. The store manager said it was the fastest they've ever promoted someone. - That's great news. - You know, I was thinkin' about Patrick's death, and it really made me consider my past actions. I think I'm makin' really good progress now. - That's great. I'm really happy for you. I, I really gotta get going, sorry. - Oh, of course, of course. Bye. It's nice meeting you. - Who was that? - That's, it's nobody. - I thought we were getting ice cream. - Let's get ice cream somewhere else. Is that Mr. Nibbles? You know he was around when I used to live here. I can't believe he's still alive. - You like cats, too? - Well, let's just say that that's the only cat I'm not allergic to. Until now. And like all cats, this thing has a mind of its own. You know, you're pretty good. Ever tried using one of these? Isla, what're you doing? - I lost the ring. - You lost the ring? What, oh, no, no, no. Why would you do that? - I was just looking. Are you mad? - Dinner's ready. - I'm not hungry. - Well, you gotta eat something. - You are mad. - Any future messages to our future children? - Um, you're gonna be an amazing dad. - You think so? - Yeah. Isla? Isla? System disarmed. - Isla? Isla? Isla! Isla! Isla! Isla! Isla! - It's just a lost ghost, it's just a lost ghost. - Isla what're you doing? What're you doing, huh? Are you okay? Come here. God, you scared me. I'm sorry about before, I swear I wasn't mad. But what you did in the kitchen, you could've hurt yourself. All right? All right, I think it's all good. What's wrong? - The water, it's too deep. - It's not that deep, it's just a tub. - It's too deep. - Okay, I'll, I'll drain some of it. - We checked all the windows and doors. No sign of forced entry. Everything's secure. - I swear I saw something. - It's the lost ghost. When they get lost, they sometimes need a place to stay. - Well, we can station a car outside for the night. Just in case? - Thank you. - Lock your doors, Miss. - Hello? Yeah, this is Isla's mom. What do you mean she's no longer in school? How the hell did you lose her? Right, right, um, let me try her cell. Isla, I got a call from school, where are you? Isla? - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa where ya goin'? - I'm sorry, I, I, I- Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Isla? - You see, the trick is to aim behind 'em. That way most of the force comes from the acceleration. Yeah. - What happened to you? Why aren't you in school? - She was pushed into the pool at school. You know something like this happens to one in four children her age? - Are you okay? - The other kids think I'm weird. - Oh. - I bet they're the weird ones. Don't you worry. I have a feeling something like this won't happen again. - You sure you're okay? Thanks Mark, for bringing her home. - It's not a problem, I saw her walking on the street and knew I had to take the initiative. It's a big house. Lotta space to look after by yourself. - Yeah. I know. I'm, I'm fine, it's uh- - Clearly you're not fine. I mean, your child left school and you had no idea. But, the important thing is that she's safe, right? Anyway, I gotta go. Bye, Isla. Hopefully see you again soon, okay? We're like buddies now. - What about this? - Oh, it's for Isla. It's softball season. See ya. - What did he say to you? - Just that you're friends, and you've been ignoring him lately. - Well, it's a bit more complicated than that. Anyway, you should've called me after what happened at school. If there's a problem, you tell me. We should have total transparency, you and I. It means total honesty. - Okay. - You're really getting into this now, huh? - That one's supposed to be you. - Oh, yeah? - And this one's Dad. - What about this one? - That's the lost ghost. - The lost ghost? - It's nobody. - Her figurines? I'm sorry to come here out of the blue. I hope you weren't in bed. - Babe. Everything all right? - Um, no. No, no, no, it's fine. Come on in. - I know it sounds crazy, I ju- - No, no, not crazy at all. I mean, just today, went to the refrigerator to grab something and when I got to the door, totally forgot what I wanted. - Yeah, was not the same. - Look, you're a single mother, you're under a lotta stress, a lotta pressure, your past history. I mean, you took the news of Patrick pretty hard. Well, you did. I mean, come on Ems, look at where you are now, you're living in a dead guy's house. - Well, you don't think he- - What? That Patrick's ghost is roaming the house? Tell ya what. Why don't I help you out? I'll take a load off, I'll pick up the ball when things get too heavy. You can crash here tonight. - Thank you. He's new. - Oh. I know. He's taking me to Cabo. - Come here, come here, come here! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, you like that? Yeah? - I really like that. - Yeah? Hey, thanks man. - Have a good day. - Oh, hey kiddo. What're you doing here? - It's swimming day. What are you doing here? - I was gonna surprise your mom with dinner. Wait, what happened? - One of the kids had a bad accident, so I finished early. - Hmm, well I hope no one was seriously hurt. - Not too bad. - Have you eaten yet? So, how're things with you and your mom? - Sometimes I think she doesn't want me around. - Of course she wants you around. What makes you think she doesn't? - Because she left before. - That was different. She was sick. - That's not what Grandma said. - What did she tell you? Have you talked to Emma about it? - We're supposed to have total transparency. - You know, they say that parenthood completely changes you. That having a kid kinda just puts your life into perspective. - Is that true? - I don't know. I mean, it's never happened to me, but I've seen it in other people. - Did it happen to Emma? - More than you think. - What was she like before? - Oh, before, She was a lot like me. - 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100! Ready or not, here I come! Hey, that's cheating! You're not supposed to switch hiding places! Here! Ashley? I give up, where are you? Ashley? Ashley? Ashley! - If you finished school early, you should've called. I could've picked you up. I need to know that you're okay. Isla, is there something you'd like to tell me about this? Just found it. Isla? Would you look at me when I'm talkin' to you? Hey. Thought we agreed on total transparency. Hmm? - You disappear when you see it. - What? - The lost ghost. - Look, I know what I said before, but there are no such things as ghosts. - You mean there's no lost ghost? - No. But there's an explanation for everything. Things just don't disappear. They always show up in the end. - Just like your ring? - Yeah. Just like my ring. We'll forget about it for now, okay? - They always show up in the end. - Emma! - The hell did you get up there? - Can I sleep in your bed? - Yeah. Okay. - So, can you fix it or what? This is like the third time you've been back to fix this camera. Listen, either the wiring is screwed up or you need to replace the unit. Look, I can't run- - Mr. Nibbles! Mr. Nibbles! Mr. Nibbles! Mr. Nibbles! Mr. Nibbles! Mr. Nibbles! Mr. Nibbles? Mr. Nibbles? Mr. Nibbles? Mr. Nibbles? - Thanks for coming. I didn't know who else to call. - Oh, it's not a problem. A friend in need is a friend indeed, right? - Well, there're already eight clips since this morning, I watched the first few but I can't see anything on them. Is there something wrong with the cameras? - Let's see. Well, the spec states that it's sound activated in addition to motion. Do ya know what coulda made that sound? - The mailman comes at 10. What was that? - House noises maybe? The sensitivity of the mics must be set to max. You don't have any pets, do you? - Mister Nibbles? - Mr. Nibbles? - God damn it, Mrs. Willis. - Mr. Nibbles? - Well, seems we found your mystery visitor. - Unbelievable. Getting another alert. - Pull up the live feed. - Mrs. Willis? Mrs. Willis? Hello? What am I gonna say to that poor woman? What could've done this? What the hell is going on in this house? - It's okay. It's okay, all right? It's all right. Shh. It's gonna be all right. Okay. - I sh, I ha- - It's okay, no, it's all right, shh. It's okay, it's okay. - No. No, I, I said no! - I'm sorry. - Jesus! - I don't understand, I mean you invited me back here. - Invite you, what, are you fuckin' kidding me? - I left in the middle of work to be here. I could get fired because of you. - Mark, I, I- - Have you ever thought about anyone besides yourself? The whole world doesn't revolve around you, Emma. Sometimes, you can be a real self-centered, selfish bitch! - Mark. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Get out. - Okay. - No, no, get out. - It's okay, it's okay. Okay. - Get out! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Do you know what happened to Mr. Nibbles? - It wasn't me. - Then who? - Him. - Him? Who's him? Answer me. - He's always here. When the door isn't completely closed, there's a gap. He's looking through it. Whenever you turn off the light and you feel somethin' behind you, he's there. I've seen him. Watching you. - Hello? Father? - Emma? Emma Wilkes? - I just don't know what else to do, who to turn to. I can't explain it, I don't know how to. I know I have no right to come here, Father. After what I did. - God's doors are always open. And particularly to those who've lost their way, come to seek answers. I'm sorry to hear about Patrick. You, um, you said this wasn't the first time you had gone through something like this? - That was different. I was different. - But these troubled thoughts only started again recently. - Yeah. Ever since, um... - Since Isla returned to your life? It isn't unheard of for unwanted evil to latch themselves onto this world through the bodies of innocents, to feed off sin. - Are you saying Isla has something evil inside her? - I'm saying, you need to make peace with your child. Tell me, has Isla been baptized? - I think I'll have a coffee too. Um, do you have the pancakes? Uh, excuse me? Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey. Is, is this gluten free? I can't have anything with gluten in it. - Excuse me. Emma! You can't leave in the middle of your shift! Emma! - Just go to your room! - Ghost, it's just the lost ghost, it's just the lost ghost, it's just the lost ghost, it's just the lost ghost, just the lost ghost, it's just the lost ghost, it's just the lost ghost. - Who were you talking to? - Nobody. - I saw you talking. Who were you talkin' to? - It wasn't me. - Then who? Then who, Isla? There's no one else here! C'mon. There's nobody else in this house, can you see? Oh, shit. - Emma? Emma? It's Mark! I know you're home, your car's in the driveway. Is this the way you treat people that help you? Emma? Emma? Emma! Okay. It's clear you need a little bit more time to think about this. - Get out of my house! Isla? Isla! Isla, Isla get up. Shh! - What's going on? - All right, you stay right here, okay? Do you think it could be Patrick? Do you think he, he could, I dunno, be here somewhere still? I, I know it sounds crazy but I, I can't think of any other explanation. It's not, it's not just me, it's Isla, she's seeing things too, she's- - She's seven years old. Children have an abstract way of viewing the world that can be influenced by adults. - You're saying it's all in my head. - I'm saying you're regressing to your old patterns. I think you should come to my office. Talk about it in person. I'll have someone call you first thing tomorrow to arrange an appointment. In the mean time, I suggest you try to get some rest. Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Goodnight Emma. - Ashley? Ash? Ashley! - Don't worry, she'll turn up in the end. - You know you can't sleep here. - I'm sorry, Officer. - License and registration. Miss? - Life is filled with trials. And many of us lose our way, but it's all part of the journey to get to the other side with our faith in Jesus unwavering. It brings great pleasure to welcome Emma back into our community, along with her daughter, Isla. - No, please! - Within these waters, those who are with sin will be reborn with salvation from the Lord Jesus. - Please, no, please. - Emma came to me the other day seeking salvation for herself, and for her daughter. Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior? - No, please, Emma! No! Don't let them do this, please! - Upon the profession of faith, I hereby baptize Isla in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. - Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen, amen, amen, amen. Amen, amen, amen. - Stop! - Emma! - Isla? Isla? Oh! Isla? Isla? Isla! Isla! Isla! Isla, come outta there, please. - You'll hurt me and get rid of me. - I promise you I won't. - You've done it before. Total transparency Emma, remember? - Yeah, okay. I'll be honest with you about everything and anything. - Did you try to get rid of me? - Yes. - Because you didn't want me? - Yes. Look, I, I won't try and make any excuses, okay? What I did was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. But, being with you now has changed everything, I've changed. - Have you? - I would do anything for you. I would go to the ends of the earth for you. - Why would you do such a thing? - 'Cause I love you. Please? Come here. Please. - Mom. - I'm right here sweetie. Isla, wake up, wake up. Shh, shh, come, c'mon, this way. This way. Okay, okay. I'm gonna need you to pull it. Mark, there's a, in the house! - No, Mom! - Hey! - Mom! - I gave you one lifeline after another to save our friendship. - Mom! - Run, run! Hide, Isla! Isla! Isla? Isla! - Mom? Over here! - Are you okay? We, we gotta go. We gotta go. - Mom! No! - Mom! Mom! Mommy. You promised. You promised you wouldn't leave me. Please stay with me, Mommy. Hold on, I'll get help. - First on scene? You won't believe where this guy was livin'. Was right under their noses the whole time. Right inside these walls. Found a passage from the Bible scratched on a board. From the book of Exodus. "But he said you cannot see my face, for no man shall see me and live." No I.D., no personal possessions. Could be just some drifter. Poor kid. I never seen anything like this before. - It's not him. It's not him. It's not him. It's not him. It's not him. It's not him. It's not him.
