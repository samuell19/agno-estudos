AND THEN I DID IT WITH YOU. MY BLUE LADY. >> CAL -- >> I REALIZE NOW THAT I SHOULD HAVE -- I SHOULD HAVE NEVER TALKED TO YOU. I MEAN, I HAD UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS. I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BROKEN DOWN MY WALL OF ILLUSION. YOU PAINT A PICTURE OF SOMEONE THAT YOU WANT TO SEE. AND THE REALITY NEVER MEASURES UP. [ SIGHS ] I TOOK MY BLUE LADY OFF HER PEDESTAL. >> OKAY, I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, ALL RIGHT, AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOU. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE GO GET SOME COFFEE AND WE'LL CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION? WE CAN GO TO THE DINER OR SOMETHING. >> [ GRUNTS ] >> [ GASPS ] [ CAR HORN HONKS ] [ SIGHS ] >> [ SIGHS ] SHIT. SEE? NOW WE'RE BOTH BROKEN. >> COME ON. >> GRADUATION'S NEXT WEEK. >> YEAH? YOU GONNA GO? >> I DON'T KNOW. APPARENTLY THEY'RE TRYING TO GIVE ME SOME KIND OF, LIKE, A SCHOLARSHIP FOR WINNING THE ART SHOW. >> WHO? SPECIAL TEENS? >> SPECIAL TEENS, YEAH. >> NO SHIT. DOES IT STILL COUNT IF YOU OBLITERATED THE WINNING ENTRY? >> MM-HMM. I TOOK PICTURES. >> WHY DO YOU DO THAT, CAL? DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT YOU MAKE? >> I DON'T KNOW. I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE I'M A BUDDHIST AND I'M HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPERMANENCE OF THINGS, YOU KNOW. >> YEAH, I'M SURE THAT'S IT. >> COULD BE LIKE -- LIKE A HINDU, YOU KNOW. REMINDING EVERYONE THE OTHER HALF OF CREATION IS DESTRUCTION. BRAHMA AND SHIVA. >> YEP. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT. >> OR MAYBE I NEED TO CHILL THE FUCK OUT. [ CHUCKLES ] I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THEY CAN TEACH ME THAT AT ART SCHOOL, LIKE, PREFERABLY WITH THE USE OF RECREATIONAL DRUGGAGE. >> HUGS, NOT DRUGS. >> RIGHT. 'CAUSE LIFE IS PRECIOUS, SHORT AND PRECIOUS. >> YEAH. >> WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH, UH, WITH JOSH? >> I DON'T KNOW. >> AM I EVER GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN? >> I-I DON'T KNOW. >> I LOVE YOU. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? >> I KNOW. YOU'LL GET OVER IT. I PROMISE. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] >> HELLO, KELLY. >> HI, BEV. IS JOSH HERE? >> COME ON IN. >> THANK YOU. >> WAKE UP, JOSH. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? >> I CAME TO APOLOGIZE. >> OUTSIDE. >> [ SIGHS ] >> [ SIGHS ] >> IS HE SLEEPING? >> YEAH. >> GOOD. >> [ SIGHS ] SO... >> UM... I'VE BEEN THINKING [CLEARS THROAT] A LOT ABOUT YOU AND ME. [ Voice breaking ] I'M REALLY SORRY FOR THE WAY I TREATED YOU. [ SOBS ] AND I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY I'VE BEEN ACTING. [ SNIFFLES ] I UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK. IT'S JUST LATELY I FELT LIKE I TOTALLY LOST WHO I WAS BEFORE JACKSON. AND THEN I'D LOST YOU, AND... AND I REALLY NEEDED YOU. I CAN'T DO IT BY MYSELF. AND I DON'T WANT TO. >> ME NEITHER. >> [ SNIFFLES ] I SCREWED UP SO BAD. >> STOP. STOP. LET ME JUST SAY SOMETHING. I LOVE YOU. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU. I KNEW YOU NEEDED ME. BUT I JUST -- I DIDN'T KNOW HOW. [ SIGHS ] I GUESS WE NEED TO TRY HARDER. BOTH OF US. >> I'D LIKE THAT. >> * I LOOK BACK * THROUGH THE STORM * I LOOK BACK * 'CAUSE IT KEEPS ME WARM * AND ALL YOU LEARN IS YOU REGRET * * OH, YOU'RE WALKING DOWN AGAIN * * AND YOU CHANGE * I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW I FEEL * * WHEN I'M NOT THERE * I NEEDED SOMETHING TO BELIEVE * * SOMETHING WE BOTH SHARE * IN A SECRET HIDING PLACE * YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND ME THERE * AND YOU CHANGE * SLOWLY CHANGE * CHA-A-A-A-A-A-NGE * AND YOU CHANGE * OH, YOU CHANGE * AND YOU CHANGE [ NEW SONG PLAYING ]
