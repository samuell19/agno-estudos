RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Please work... Go, five! Go! Go! Yes! Hey. So, what do you think, Ellie? I think it's the most ambitious proposal we've ever had. I mean, we've never approved anything beyond 30 stories in this district. Well, it's supply and demand. Cities need to move out and up. Yeah. How does the community feel about it? Surveys were just sent. That's a little late, isn't it? Depends on who you ask. As city planners, it's our job to get these developments approved. By the way, I need you to make an appearance tonight at the Regency event. I think the developers want to impress us. No... no! Thank you so much. You know, you could move that poinsettia, 'cause it's getting cold in the ice. Probably not your department, though, so... There, you'll be much happier over here. What's the matter, it doesn't like champagne? No, it's just cold on the ice. You know, I wouldn't worry about it. It's just here for the party. They'll toss it at the end of the night. Oh, really? That's sad. It took eight months for it to show its color. Now, am I offending you, or the plant? No, you're not offending me at all, I'm sorry. I'm just, awkward. Hi. I'm sorry. How do you like the Regency? It's a spectacular building. It absolutely is. You know, I actually bought the penthouse for myself. So you're familiar. Derek Cowan. Cowan Construction. Hi, I'm Ellie Palmer. - Ellie. - Yes. I have seen your name on some of our approvals. That's right, that's me. I was just looking over your most recent proposal, actually. Good, because I really want to get that one started by the new year... ...so I'm sure you'll have that approved by, what, Christmas? Yeah, we're definitely... Oh, shoot, I should probably get this. Not one of our competitors, I hope. What competitors? You own the skyline. I like you. Hi, Mom. It sounds like you're at a party. Yeah, it's a work thing. Well, I need to talk to you now while your father's out putting up your sister's lights. Okay, what's up? Your father hurt his back, and he's going to need some help with the farm. Why is he putting up Grace's lights, then? Well, you know your father, Ellie. He can never admit when he can't do something, and he doesn't even know that I'm calling you... but he really could use your help. How soon do you need me to come home? Well, how soon could you get here? Lorna? Hey. How was the party? It was great. I brought you a little something. And I met Derek, and I assured him, don't worry, we're going to push his project through. - Great. - Yeah. I know I can count on you, Ellie. Yes, and you can count on me to be on top of it while I'm home. What do you mean? So, my dad's hurt his back. It's the busiest time of year for my family's poinsettia farm. Basically, the poinsettias have to be harvested... I'm not going to pretend I understand anything about flowers or farming. It's, they're plants, it's poinsettias, they're... It's a plant. Just make sure Cowan's proposal gets approved before Christmas so they can break ground in the new year. You got it. Okay. - Hi! - There she is! There's my favorite niece! Come here! I'm gonna be playing a solo in my school Christmas concert! You are? Oh, my gosh, congratulations! Hi! - Hi! - How are you? - I'm good. How's Dad? He's putting on a brave face, but you know what it's like. Rick's unit is still overseas? He is until the new year. But we have good news... There's gonna be three of us celebrating Christmas this year! No way! Ooh, I'm so excited! I know, I'm already 12 weeks along. Who else knows? Well, Mom and Dad, and now you. Dad doesn't know. When we comes home, it's gonna be a surprise! It's gonna be the best surprise ever. I'm really happy for you. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Come on. Brr! Okay, let's get going. We've got to stop and get some dinner rolls. I'm so excited to see you! Nothing changes in Conway. Not if we can help it. In fact, we just stopped a Crestco from opening up just outside of town. Why? It's a one-stop shop so you don't have to go to, like, five different stores. But Mr. G always gives me best fudge, and Miss Mable always gives me the best hot chocolate. Well, you can't fight development forever. Look at Grafton. It's had so much growth in the last year, you can practically see it from here. Yeah, but the longer we keep it at bay, the better. All right, let's go see if Mr. G has some of that fudge you've been talking about. You coming? I have a work email to answer, sorry. Okay. Patty Mason... Thank you, Mr. G! All right, we got the last of the rolls. Let's get you ladies home. Come on, kiddo. Greg, they're here! - Hi! - Hey! Hey, look, it's my three favorite girls! Oh, gosh! Hi, hon. Hey, I've got some fresh shortbread that I just baked. It's in the kitchen waiting for you. Thank you, Grandma! Okay. And I've got this waiting for you. Mom! Oh, gosh, I've missed you! - I missed you too... - Well, well, well... Hey, Dad! Hey, stranger. What a surprise. I'm not used to seeing you around here till the day right before Christmas. Well, Mom told me about your back, and I thought maybe I should come, and, you know, help out. Which is very nice. Don't you think? Yes, very nice. Oops. Why don't you show her the plants? - No, no, no, it's late... - It's kinda late... They should stay covered. Like a souffl√©. Of course. You two. I'm going get cleaned up. I going to go make sure Avery's not eating all of the shortbread. Okay. Are you coming? Yeah. Yeah. I gotta get my bags. What? Whose truck is this? Geez... Bucket in the middle of the road... Whose truck is this? - Oh, gosh! - Oh, geez! Oh! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Here, let me get you something. Why is this bucket in the middle of the driveway? I tripped over it. I'm spilling it. I'm so sorry. It's all right. It's just... cashmere. That's the expensive one, right? Yeah. Geez... That didn't do anything, did it? It's all right. I'm well adept at cleaning dirt. I'm Ellie. Palmer. Shawn. Shawn Dalton, Hey. Ellie Palmer. You're Greg's other daughter. That I am. It's great to meet you. You too. Who... who are you? I mean, what do you... why are you here? I work here at the farm. I just help your dad with the poinsettias, and... stuff. You work at the farm? Yeah, just under a year. That's so weird. I haven't heard anything about you. Well, I've heard all about you, and it's a great honor to meet The Ellie Palmer. I mean, your dad's told me all about how you were his right hand since you were yea high. Yeah, I have been. Usually we keep the soil in the greenhouse, actually. It's closer to the plants, easier to get them where they need to be. Yeah, well, I just recently had this idea where we'd bring it out here, little closer to the truck, little closer to everything, just a little more efficient. Well, I don't know if it really is closer to everything... Hey! Dinner's almost ready! Okay, well... I'm gonna go get cleaned up. Nice to meet you. It was great to meet you. Yeah, I'll see you around. You'll be seeing me soon enough. Okay. I'm sorry! Don't mention it. I'm telling you, when I was up on the front of that float, and the wheel popped off... I thought I was going to fall right through Miss Mable's front window. Well, don't worry, because this time, I'll make sure everything's screwed on tight. I'll bet you will. Are you guys talking about the parade last year, where you almost fell off the float? Yes, but this year, I'm not worried about it at all, because Shawn is building the frame, and he's every bit as good with a hammer and nails as he is out there in that greenhouse. I don't know about that. I mean, this is my first time working a poinsettia farm... Yeah, yeah, give yourself a little credit. I have no idea what I'd do around here without you. How did you guys meet? Well... After I sold my farm outside Grafton, I moved here about a year ago. He sold his farm because the developers bullied him out. Oh, you got bullied, huh? Usually you have to agree to sell, right? Sure. But, I mean, they made it pretty clear that they'd just keep building around me, so eventually I'd lose my view. And besides, could you imagine all the complaints about the manure? Wouldn't even know what hit 'em! All right, everybody, dinner... is served. - Hey! - Excellent, excellent. Katherine, is that your famous sweet potato casserole? - Best in the county. - Absolutely. Well, go easy, guys. Should save some for others, all right? Can't make any promises. Thank you. Sorry, I'm sorry, I always... That's my seat, yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Okay. So, Shawn, do you have your own family, or... Are you asking me if I'm married? I'm not. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, my mom and dad are in Ohio, and this time of the year, they go stay with my brother and his family. Usually I go too, but right now, I'm needed here for the poinsettias and the parade, so... I decided to stay. - Yeah? - Well, don't you worry. We will hang a stocking for you. Because Santa will always find you. Well, I'd better stay out of the naughty books, then, huh? Do we, still have the contract for the poinsettias for the parade? Yes, we sure do. Just that they want to double the order this year. Double? That's going to increase our order by a thousand. Can we do that and keep up with our other orders? I'm sure we will manage something. Here, honey. You know... I'm sorry... Excuse me. Yes, the joys of the first trimester. And what about you, Ellie? What about me? Any boyfriend at the moment? No, work's got me pretty busy. Hey, what do they call those guys in the city? They're, metro... Metro... ...politan? That's it! Metropolitan. Like the ice cream. Can I have some salad, please? I'm going to check on Grace. All right, thank you. Wait, that's Neapolitan, isn't it? You feeling okay? Yeah, a lot better with the fresh air. Dad making cracks? Yup, every time I come home. It's just because he misses you. Well, he's got a funny way of showing it. Now he's got this Shawn guy as his right-hand man? Who's this? He needs the help, Ellie. You're gonna see that. Well, that's why I was here. Yeah, but you're only here for a couple weeks. Hey, Mom. Ooh, don't you look ready for work? Yeah, I am. Where's everybody else? You know, the other workers, they haven't started yet. They haven't started yet? We're two weeks away from our deliveries. What's wrong? What's wrong? I think that you should go outside and talk to your dad about it. Dad... Why are the bracts green? I have no idea. Ellie, I don't know, I wish I could tell you. I haven't done anything different. The same thing I do every year, and they just, they won't change color. If they're not red by now, you're never going to make your delivery. Don't think I... I'm sorry. I know that. I'm aware. I get it. Have you tried checking for rot root? Or pests? Or feeding them something differently? Yeah, we tried everything. You just said that you've never worked on a poinsettia farm, right? I'm not sure how much you know about this. Ellie... Shawn has been right by my side for months. He knows a lot more about poinsettias than you'd think. Okay, I'm sorry. Why are those red? Those are red because they're left over from last year. Your mother took the clippings, she grew them outside, and then she put them in the shed at night so we'd have room for these... in here. Other than that, I-I... I'm gonna go... What are we gonna do? I don't know what to do, sweetheart. You know, for what it's worth, your dad's taught me a lot over the last year, and, I mean, I've always worked my own land, so... I appreciate that, but poinsettias require a very specific touch, from light to pinching them... You have to understand them, so obviously something is off, even if Dad says he hasn't done anything differently. That's the thing, right? You can do everything the same, but the Earth's always changing, so what you did yesterday may not always work tomorrow. That I do understand. - Dad! - Yeah! Hey, knock it off. Come on. Seriously, with your back. Drop it. No, my back is fine, sweetheart. No, Dad, seriously, stop. - It hurts a little bit... - Stop it, please. Well, I'm gonna... Please, Dad, stop it. My back has got nothing to do with why your... ...why your mother brought you out here in the first place. Okay, then why am I here? We are in trouble. Sweetheart, we're in big trouble, and you have a knack, you have a gift, you make things grow. If we're gonna get out of this mess, it's gotta be you that's going to do it. I really... I really don't know about that. It's been a long time since I've been on a farm, Dad. You never lose a natural gift. Ever. Well, whatever the reason that you brought me out here, this is stopping. Go do something else. Have a coffee, it's been a while. - What the heck is that? - What? Okay, get! You always fall for that! - Come on, old man! - Okay, I'm goin'! I'm going... Hey. I would like some help with this. - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. You know, we usually use solid plywood with those. Yeah, I know. But this way, the plants can breathe and not feel like they're trapped. No living thing likes to feel that way, so... All right. I'm just gonna... Thanks. Thanks. Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're caught. Here, Ellie. I got it, I got it. It's okay. - Okay. - Sorry. - As you were. - Okay. Sorry, I didn't see you there. Is that so? So why'd you leave here, exactly? I mean, it's pretty obvious you've got a way with this place. I don't know, I guess my dreams changed. Well, mine never did. You're telling me this is your dream? My dream was to work with my hands in a place where I could watch the sun rise in the east and set in the west, and that is exactly what I do. But I should get going. I've got four flatbeds to build for four floats. - Okay. - One more. That's kind of a tongue-twister. What? "Four flatbeds for four floats." Try it. Four flatbeds for four floats... Oh, yeah. Four flatbeds for four floats. It's four flatbeds for four floats. Floor flap... Four flatbleds... Four flap... That's not bad. And you know what the best part is... Is I finally get to see that smile you've been trying to hide all day. Peace out, guys! Hey... Why does the city want double the amount of poinsettias for the parade this year? Because this year, it's going to be televised. What? For real? Why? 'Cause Patty Mason's leading the parade. Patty? What, did she bump Santa? She has her own TV show, Ellie, and for the Christmas episode, they're going to tape the parade. How... I'm sorry, how... Of course Patty ended up on TV. You mean you never saw her on YouTube? Maybe you should show her. Can't imagine how I missed that. Hello, everyone! I'm Patty Mason, and today I'm gonna show you how to DIY your very own snowflake Christmas cookie... So she started posting videos on how to make your own gingerbread houses, and then one of the local networks caught on, and next thing you know, they think they've found their very own Martha Stewart. Oh, please. Patty couldn't even make a brownie in the Easy-Bake when we were kids. Oh, boy. You mean, you couldn't, right, sweetheart? I wouldn't know, 'cause Patty never let me use her Easy-Bake. That's not sharing. See? You got it. Come on. You girls, I swear. If Patty had pink gloves, you had to have pink gloves. If she got her ears pierced, you had to go get yours done too. Sounds to me like someone's jealous of Patty. Yeah, I'm jealous of Patty Mason. Every time I'm sitting in my office planning a city, I think, "Oh, gee, I really wish I was making gingerbread houses out of little Conway." Why can't we just put off this decision just a little longer? I mean, at least until after the new year? Sweetheart, she's going to leave right after Christmas, just like she always does. Hey. Hey... Hey, honey, I have a lot of accounting that I've got to get out now, but could you do me a favor? I've ordered some stuff online from Miss Mable's. Could you go and pick it up for me? You guys want me to run errands? What are we doing about the bracts? Sweetheart, unless you come up with some great idea, nothing's going to change while you're gone. Help your mom. All right. The old girl giving you some trouble? Yeah, didn't like me hammering on the gas. Yeah, she usually doesn't. Let me give you a hand there. It's just on this... No, it's on this side. No, it's over here... I know this truck... Oh, mother... Are you okay? Easy, easy... That kind of language could wilt the poinsettias. Are you all right? Yeah. It's my fault. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have a look. Oh, well, the fan belt's blown, so you're not going anywhere fast. Want a ride? We should, split up. I'll go to Mable's General, and you can go to the hardware store and get what you need to fix the truck. What, are you kidding, and miss saying hello to Mable? Not a chance. All right, I mean, it'll take twice as long, but... Off you go. Ooh, hey, handsome! Ooh! Now, don't tell me you just caught wind I just tied off a fresh batch, hmm? Actually, I'm not the one who's shopping today. Well, Ellie Palmer! Mable, hi. Good lord, girl, what are they feeding you in the city? Now, let me guess, you are eating smoothies, and sushi, and all kind of things. Yes, I am, but I still crave your homemade sausage more than anything. Now, he eats about two pounds a week, you can tell, huh? Yeah, I remember when my husband had those. Lord. What are you doing back here, anyhow? You usually just blow in and outta here over the Christmas. Yeah, I'm a little early this year, just helping my dad. You know, he is gonna be so thrilled about that. Now, you probably came to pick up your mama's things. Yes, ma'am. All right. I'll be right back. Thanks. So how come you only ever stayed a couple of days over Christmas, anyway? I don't know, I guess I just got busy. These are so cute. My mother would love these. I've got one almost finished. I could bring it by the house. You make all these? Sure did. What are you, a jack of all trades? There's plenty of things I can't do. Oh, god... Patty's gingerbread houses. These are good. Yeah, her show's pretty good, too. Have you seen it? No, I haven't. I mean, my niece showed me a clip on YouTube or something. Patty and I grew up together. We did not get along. All right, here you go. Thank you. Now, please say hello to your family for me, and don't you forget to say goodbye, okay? I won't. Okay, bye. - All right, my love. - Merry Christmas! Toodle-oo. Thank you! Go on, now. Bye! Thank you. So, you ever miss this place or what? I don't know, I'm doing so well in the city, I don't know that I have time to think about it much. Well, I could never live in the city. Why do you say that? 'Cause. Listen... - I hear nothing. - Exactly. - Exactly. - Exactly. You don't get this kind of peace in the city. Aw, geez, sorry, I probably have oil from the truck still, and... That's all right, I grew up in dirt. So you're saying the city hasn't cleaned you up that much? Not too much, sir. All right, next stop, hardware store. Oh, great! We can see how Jensen's new barn is coming along. - He got a new barn? - You gotta see it. He's got this tin roof with these solar panels... Solar panels, good for him! There you are. I came to check on the plants and bring you some homemade chicken pot pie. Thanks, Patty. Hi, Ellie! I haven't seen you in, what, three years? Yeah. Golly. I think it was when you were working at that diner. That was, like, a lifetime ago. Well, if you can believe it or not, I have my own TV show here in Conway. Maybe you've seen it? It's called "Patty's Lifestyle"? No. No, we don't get WPC in the city. Of course you don't. Well, how is city life going for you? What are you, some executive now with some big hotshot boyfriend? No, no, just, you know, urban planning, building 50-story condos and parking lots. Cute, parking lots. That's great, okay, well, I have to jet now. Thank you for clearing up those rumors about the poinsettas. I was starting to get worried that they weren't going to be ready for the parade, and this year's gonna be so big. Yeah. Bye. Bye, Patty. Greg! Please think about my latest offer. Yeah. Does she want to make you poinsettia cookies? What's her offer? What? What's going on? Spit it out. Patty offered to buy the farm. This farm? Sweetheart, you know things have been very tight around here lately, and with the crop this year, and, really, it is, it's just too much work. Listen, fact of the matter is, if the poinsettias aren't ready for the parade, none of it makes any difference anyway. Well, then, we're going to have to make them ready. Here! - Honey... - No, come here... No, this is unbelievable! Let her be, let her be, let her be... Hey, stranger. Hey. What are you doing out here? This is kind of my spot. Kind of my spot. Well, I didn't know that, but would you share your spot with me? Yeah, sure. Coffee? Yeah, sure. Thanks. I couldn't sleep all night. I thought I'd try and come out here and see if I could get a breakthrough. Well, if you're gonna have one, this would be the place. Yeah. So, have you come up with anything yet? Any reason why the bracts aren't changing color? The only thing I can think of maybe is because we recycled the fertilizer, so maybe the molybdenum levels have spiked? Yeah, well, poinsettias are big eaters, so it's possible. - Yeah. What do you suggest? Well, I guess we would just need a whole new batch of fertilizer. Just start all over. I mean, if my dad will go for it. You know how much he hates change. That is true. He must have had a hard time losing you. So what exactly do you do in the city, anyway? All your dad's told me is that you pave over everything. Of course he would say that. I am an urban planner. I help get approval for different developments in the city, and I accommodate growth, et cetera, et cetera. "Et cetera, et cetera"? - Yeah, you know. - You like it? Yeah. I mean, I got my degree in it. And my boss really counts on me, and... ...I'm pretty good at, you know... getting things done... Speak of the devil. Hi, Lorna, how are you? Not good. The community's pushing back on the Malloy. What are they pushing back on? The usual. Lost park space, increased traffic. And we don't have time for it, so I need to know you've got this. Yes, of course I have it. I'm so totally on top of it. Good. Get this done for Christmas, Ellie. We're counting on you. Okay. You got it. Dad, it makes sense that recycling the fertilizer concentrates the levels, so why not mix it up? It's like giving a dog new food, right? They gobble it up, and maybe it's gonna motivate them to change color. Ellie, I have been using the same mixture of fertilizer for, what, 40 years. I don't see what changing up the mixture of the fertilizer could possibly do to make the plants... I don't know what other ideas we have, Dad. I don't know why I'm here if I'm not going to be listened to. All right. If you think it'll help, then it's worth a try. - Really? - Yeah. Special delivery. This is good. Anything that mixes it up should be good, though, right? Let's hope this works. So, what do you think, overhead or direct? - Direct soil for sure. - Okay. I don't get it. My dad has never crammed them in like this. I mean, look at these plants. Yeah, well, I mean, we still have the order for the parade, so... it was either this, or your dad purchase another greenhouse, and I don't really think that was in the budget. Still, they're just claustrophobic. They're not going to get the same distribution of water, unless we create a... flow! What do you mean? A flow! So, whenever we're doing a new build in the city, we create a flow so that the pedestrians and the traffic can all go together. So we have to create our own flow. Come on. Did you bring your toolkit? Never leave home without it. Okay, so we're going to measure these to make sure that they're spaced exactly evenly apart. - Okay. - Okay. Line them up between the last two tables here, just to make sure it's even. - Okay. We need eight of these, that long. - I can do that. - All right. Okay. Last... one. Good job, partner. I got a splinter. Here, let's have a look. No, it's fine. Come on. No, I'm good, I got it, I got it. Here... Come on, let me have a look. It's right here, I got it, it's just a... Hey, let me help you. How? I like to think I'm really good with splinters. Six Christmas cakes I have to have for the bake sale by tomorrow, and Avery just tells me this tonight. I'll help you. No, you can't. You can put down Patty Mason all you want, but you do not know your way around a kitchen. It's just 'cause Mom was always teaching you. No, it's because you were always out in the greenhouse with Dad, and she knew that's where you belonged. Not anymore. Really? 'Cause she said you've been out there every day. Well, yeah, I don't want them to lose the farm. It means everything to them. Dad especially. So it wouldn't bother you if they did sell it to Patty? It would bother me because of them. Where would Mom and Dad go? Mom, are the cakes ready yet? They will be when you finish practicing. Mom, I'm tired. I don't want to practice anymore. Okay, sweetheart, just do ten more minutes, okay? Okay. Okay. She doesn't know it yet, but she really does have talent. You've got to see her up there on that stage. She belongs there. Well, don't push her too hard. You might just push her right off the stage. Like Dad did with you? I mean I could stir something. Fine, get over here. Get me away from this bowl of cheese... Thank goodness we had cuttings left from last year's plants, or we would not be able to make this annual donation. Katherine, Ellie. Hi! What a beautiful batch this year. Thank you, thank you. We have one for each classroom, and also we've got enough for the auditorium for the Christmas show. Where would you like these? Follow me, and we'll find some spots, and Ellie, you can start with the classrooms down there. - Love to. - See you later. Let me take that for you. Thank you! Thanks. How's the show coming along? The kids are fantastic... All right, so if you look right here, you'll see a little plate of cookies has been set out for when Santa comes flying down the chimney. Really? Look at the birdhouse! Whoa... Okay, everybody, so, look, but don't touch. Hey! Hi! You didn't... Did you make this? I did make this, in fact. Yeah, it started as a model of the house I'm building, and sort of grew from there. It's incredible. You put a Christmas tree in there and everything? Yeah, yeah. Hey, River, grab the lights for me, bud? Watch this. Ta-da! It's so magical! Yeah... Will you give me a tour? Of course. Come around back here. Well, these are all my various rooms and such. You've got your bedroom, staircase... and if you look down here, this is my favorite room, the mud room. Do you know why? Because I found these little boots made for a keychain. Aw, and you put mud on them and everything. Yeah, boots should be muddy. Hi, Patty! Hi, kids! Who's ready to make some gingerbread houses? Me! Well, hi, Ellie. What brings you by? Just delivering our annual poinsettia donation. You know, the Palmers have been doing that for 40 years. I take it your father has talked to you about my offer? Yes, he has. I'm still trying to figure out what somebody with a little craft show is going to do with a whole farm. Well, it's quite simple, really. See, I've made my name from making gingerbread houses, and I have expanded that into everything from how to make napkin rings and garlands, so I figure why not a cute little poinsetta farm? "Poinsettia." Except you don't know anything about plants or farming. Maybe. But I do know how to expand a brand. Besides, you're one to preach. How long has it been since you even worked on your farm? Well, you don't really ever forget what comes natural, Patty. True. Except I have taken what comes natural to me, and I'm actually doing it. How about you come to my house tomorrow for my next taping, and I can show you all the beautiful things I know how to do with a poinsettia. Okay, that sounds great. I'm excited to see you. So great. Now, who's ready to make some gingerbread houses? Me! I am! Candy! I want so much frosting! Hi. Hi. Whatcha doing? I'm fixing Dad's Santa hat. I don't know if he's told you, but, boy, is he grateful that you're home. I'm not sure what the point is if he's going to sell. I don't think he's decided yet. I think he's waiting. For what, to make his deliveries? Well, that's part of it. I hope he's not waiting on me, because I'm... doing what I want, not what's expected of me. Ellie, everybody knows that your dad was disappointed when you decided not to follow in his footsteps, but if you're doing what you truly want, and not trying to make a point, then he's happy. Well, then, he can be happy for me, because... I wouldn't stay in the city just to make a point. Any color? Any color at all? No, I think we have to give the fertilizer a little bit more time to work. Did she make you a good offer? Fair. Enough to make you happy? Money is not going to make me happy, Ellie. That's what family is for. You know, I would like to know what Patty thinks she would do with all of this. Thank you. Oh, geez, sorry. There you are. I didn't think that you would make it. Well, why wouldn't I? Well, I've put a little seat there for you, so you can watch without getting in the way of the camera. And three... Two... Good morning, Conway. As you all know, Christmas dinner with our families are our most cherished holiday traditions, and today I'm gonna show you how to add a little Christmas pizzazz to your dinner table. First, you're gonna take your greenery, and then you're gonna place it around like this. I personally love to use just a single candle in the middle, but you can use multiple tapers, and place them around like this. Now, make sure you add your finishing touches... just like this... And there you have it, a beautiful centerpiece. It looks like we have a fan with us today. Ellie, would you like to come up here and help me with my next segment? Come on, don't be shy. Why, almost everyone knows your name. Ellie Palmer from Palmer Poinsettas, say hello to Conway. Hi. Actually, it's "poinsettia." Oh, well, I say "poinsetta." Tomato, tom-ah-to. Well, now that we have a centerpiece, we are going to make a delicious chocolate Christmas cake for dessert. Do you like to bake? Sure. If it's easy. Like an Easy-Bake oven. I loved that as a kid. I know. Well, now, the trick to a perfect cake is all in the sifting, and I like to use a mixer because I feel like it adds some air into your dry ingredients, and you can help me with sifting. You can use this mixer right here. Okay, just turn it on? Yeah. And while you do that, I'm going to add some sugar. There you go, and some baking powder, and just sift it and mix it. Perfect. You're doing good. Now, over here I have some melted chocolate. I like to add some coffee to it, like this. How you doing over there? Fine. I mean, it doesn't look any different. I should probably speed it up... Well, it's not going to look different... Whoa, slow down! Sorry. It's still stuck. Okay, well, you might want to slow it down a little bit. Oh, shoot, it's stuck... I'm sorry. Okay... geez. It's okay, it's okay. Hey, at least now we know how to not sift our flour. And when we come back, I will show you how to make a butter frosting that's great for any occasion. And we're out. Whoa! Oh, my god, I'm so sorry, I just ruined your show. I'm sorry. No, no, no, not at all. It's probably going to be good for our ratings. I'm sure everybody in town will tune in. Right. Well, for what it's worth, I'm not surprised you're doing so well. Thank you. Okay, I'm a mess. Oh, god... Hey, Ell... I'm not trying to take your family's farm, okay? I just heard that your dad was struggling a bit, so I offered my help, but I'm not pressuring him... Thank you, thank you. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Yeah, s-sorry again. It's okay, it's okay... Hey, at least now we know how to not sift our flour, and when we come back... She's a bull in the china shop, that one. That's why she belongs in the greenhouse. Hey... Well... Actually, the city suits me just fine. Okay. Hey. Hey. Any change with the plants? No, not that I can tell. Maybe some flour in the fertilizer might help. Ha ha. I can't believe I let Patty rope me into that. Yeah, she can be pretty persuasive. You know, when I first moved here, I had these big dreams of starting my own farm, and having a family, and kids, and building something to pass down. And then... when I had to sell it, I was so afraid to tell my parents. And then when I finally got up the courage to tell my dad... he just shook my hand, and he looked at me, and he said, "Son, I'm proud of you, and I trust that you're making the best decision for you." And I don't know, it wasn't until I made such a huge decision that I finally had appreciation for all the big decisions they've always had to make. That was when I finally started to look at them as just people, and not parents. You've got a little bit of... Well, you've got a lot. Hey, Lorna! How are things at the office? Excellent. We just got the approvals for the new Crestco on Davenport and Nine. Great. Listen, Derek Cowan, you know, you met him at the Regency party? He was asking about you. Lorna, I promise, you don't have to worry. I'm gonna get the Malloy Place approved. No, it's not that. He wants to ask you to dinner. Why? So he can get me to pull more strings? No. Just to have dinner. You're not with anyone, right? Well, no, but... Please don't tell me he's not your type. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Well, I guess the new fertilizer didn't work. It was a great idea, it made total sense. If it was a great idea that made sense, they would all be red by now, but they're not. We've got five days before they have to be on the truck, and I have no more ideas, I'm out, and everybody's counting on me. Oh, boy, I know that look. Yeah. Hey, honey. What's wrong, sweetheart? Just frustrated is all. You know, I think that we're all getting a little too stressed out, and it's Christmas time, so I'm going to make an executive decision, and I'm going to send you, both of you, out to go get the Palmer family Christmas Tree. Mom, I wanna stay and focus on the poinsettias. Well, you know that a watched pot never boils. Besides, it is a tradition that a member of the Palmer family chop down that tree, so... You have an axe? Yeah, in the truck. You know where you're going? Yeah, I'll let you know when we get there. It was gonna fall on you. It would've hurt! Excuse me, I knew exactly what I was doing, thank you. This is heavier than it looks. What about you? Do you have any holiday family traditions? Yeah. We always get a blue spruce, and then my brother and I make this little paper chain that we'd wrap around the tree on December 1st, and each day after that we'd take off a ring, until there's one ring left on Christmas Eve, and we'd take that off, and we'd write a little note to Santa, and we'd leave it with his milk and cookies. Aw, that's adorable. Yeah, I'm kinda hoping to continue that tradition with my own kids one day. Sounds like something Patty would be into. Yeah. Patty... I'm not sure mine and Patty's paths are leading us there. That's probably why I haven't told her about our little Dalton tradition. Actually, I don't think I've told anybody except for you, outside of the family. Well, that's kind of fitting, considering you're out here, sharing one of mine. I've gotta tie my shoe. Sorry, can we stop for a sec? Thanks. Snow! You did not just do that. Okay... You... Okay... What are you thinking? I'm thinking we picked the perfect tree. Well, this oughtta do it. Last box. Whoa. Geez, Dad, what are you doing to us? We're gonna be here all night. Look at all this. Here comes Santa's little helper! Our little helper is here! Hi! Let me help you with that. Mom, have you been buying more ornaments again? I have no idea what you're talking about. Right, right, right. Don't mind if I do. You can't eat that. It's to make popcorn garland, so after the new year, when we put the tree out, the birds get to eat it. Okay... It's really beautiful, actually. We get to watch all the birds sit on the branches and pick at the popcorn, and it's like Christmas morning all over again. Can I put the angel on top? I tell you what, you grab that angel, I'll grab this angel. One, two, three... No, Dad! Girls, please... You've got to remember your back! Okay, I'll sit down, and I'll... string popcorn garland. Good. It's not that bad. Here. I'll give you a boost, okay? I think maybe... Knock knock! Hey, I rang, I'm not sure if anyone heard me, I'm sorry. You guys are making popcorn garland. You know, if you add a little glitter to the bowl, it gives the tree a real sparkle. It's pretty. I don't think that's healthy for the birds. I know, but it makes the tree really pretty. Hey, Patty... why don't you and I go talk outside for a minute, all right? Okay. Here, sweetheart, you make your grandma some popcorn garland. You know I'm not trying to put any pressure on you, Mr. Palmer. I understand that, so it shouldn't make that much of a difference if you waited until the new year, right? Yes, I guess, although I'm not sure what you think might change until then. I'd appreciate it if you could... wait. No, I understand. I know this is a very hard decision for you, so... Yeah. All right, good night. Good night. Looks good. Yeah. Did Grace take Avery to bed? Yup, and she wanted to make sure that you come see her ballet recital. Of course. Of course I will. I guess I should get going. Okay. Good night, Ellie. Thanks for your help. Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay, have a good one. Did you accept Patty's offer? Not yet. Dad, I think, maybe you should. Because I cannot figure out what's going on with the poinsettias. You know, this is my favorite time of the day. Still. Quiet. Everything lit up by the stars. It has a way of reminding me just how... insignificant everything else is. Things change, Ell. Some of those things you have control over, and some you don't, so it's best you just let it go. Like the stars... even though somehow, they... they just don't seem as bright as they used to. I know that no matter what happens, I'm just lucky to be a part of any of it, any of it at all. That's it! Guys, I have it! I know the reason why the bracts aren't changing color! I think. You said it yourself. "The stars don't seem as bright anymore." And they're not, because of the city lights from Grafton. Think about how much development that city has had over the last year, which means more city lights brightening up the sky, which means the covers that we've always used may be too porous. Well, that makes sense, right, Dad? Hang on a second, so... wait a minute. Sweetheart, you're saying, that the plants are getting too much light because of the city lights? Yes. Well, even if that was the case, and we could get new coverings, there's not a chance they'll change in time. Unless we do something really drastic. Like? Here's what I'm thinking. Right now, we have the plants in a cold hold. What if we turn up the heat during the day, and then at night, we cover them for, like, 15 hours at least. We can trick them into acceleration. Do you really think that could work? I don't know, but it's the only thing we have to try. Right, Dad? Yeah, yeah. She's right. I'm gonna call Phil, put an emergency call in, and get those more porous coverings. I knew that getting you back here was the right thing to do. I hope so. So, my agent called me, and since the show with Ellie went viral, he thinks that I should bring on more guests, and I suggested you. - Me? - Yeah. Well, what-what would I do? Shawn, you're a skilled carpenter. The possibilities are endless. Plus we'd make a really good team. Maybe even get picked up by, like, a really big network. I don't know, it's exciting. Yeah. Who is it? It's... It's Ellie Palmer. Aren't you going to answer it? Hey, Ellie... everything all right? Yeah. Hi, yeah, it's great. That's why I'm calling, actually. I had a breakthrough. Really? What did you figure out? It's the city lights. They're altering the darkness while the plants sleep. Yeah, no, that's gotta be it. How'd you come up with that? It was just something my dad said, and... Oh, god, I know, it might really be a long shot, but I think... I think I might actually have it. Am I crazy? No. No, no, no, that's... it's exciting. It is! So, I don't want to keep you. I just will, see you tomorrow, I guess? Yeah, you bet. What was that about? Ellie just had some thoughts on... Hold on. It's my agent. Hi, Donald, it's Patty. What? No, that's... Yes! Are you kidding me? Yes! Okay. Okay. So, for tonight, we'll put these old tarps back on, then after that, we'll cover those with the new blankets, and hopefully that will keep the light out, yeah? Yeah. I hope so. Boy, you feel that heat? Yeah, it's kicking in. Come on, guys! All right, well, my mom was right, a watched pot never boils. Wanna see something cool? Sure. You comin'? Up there, huh? Yeah. Okay. You all right? Yeah. Okay. From that post, all the way over to that barn, that's all Palmer. Can I tell you a secret? - Sure. - I already knew that. Of course you did. My dad probably told you on day one. - Yup. - "Come look at my land!" So when was the last time you came up here? I think it was, like, 10 years ago. The first time I came up here, I was five. My dad found me on Christmas Eve, standing on the roof, shivering, holding a plate of cookies and a gallon of milk, just waiting for Santa Claus. It sort of became my spot after that. I used to just come up here and daydream about all the things I was gonna grow on this land. And when did those dreams change? When I started seeing all this as too small. Sure is pretty, though. There's no place like home. Jinx! You owe me a coke! - Okay... - I'm sorry! - Easy... - I'm sorry. Glad you're coming to Avery's recital. Yeah, well, I promised I would. It's nice, how much a part of the family you are. Yeah? Yeah. Don't tell anybody I said that, though. I wouldn't dare. Avery got to talk to her dad last night. She was so excited. Great. She made me promise to make sure that we record the show so I can send it to him later. Yeah. I'm sorry he's not home for Christmas. That's okay. As long as he gets home safe, that's all that matters. Yeah. Look who's here. - Shawn! - Hey. Good to see you. All good? Well, if that wasn't a look of disappointment, I don't know what is. Aw... See, she really does belong up on that stage. So great to see somebody doing what they love. Yeah, let's just hope she remembers that when she's older. There she is! Hi! Sweetheart, you were amazing. The star of the show. - You think so? - Yes, I do. 100%! I'll go get the car. Hey, there's the little sugar plum fairy. And here is a sugar plum for you. - Thanks, Patty! - You're very welcome. So, did you tell them? Well, I was just gonna... Guess who is going to be on tomorrow's show? Who? Shawn! That sounds like fun. I know, I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner. I mean, it's kind of perfect, like us. We both like to make things, so now we can make things together on my show. Please make sure you guys tune in, okay? - Okay. - Yay! I'll see you guys later. Have a good night. Bye, Patty! Bye, Shawn! Bye, kiddo. Bye! See ya. Did you see him? Yeah. He seems like a deer in the headlights. Yeah. He's sweating already. I think your left side might be your better side, so try to favor that side towards the camera, okay? Like...? Okay, no, never mind. Switch with me, switch with me, switch. Patty, I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing, okay? I mean, the last time I was in front of a camera, my mom was taping me singing in the school choir... Okay, relax. Everything's gonna be okay. We're gonna do great, okay? Trust me. Okay. Yoo-hoo, Ellie! Come on, the show's gonna start! Hello, Conway, and thank you for tuning in today, because we have a very, very special guest, my partner in crafting, Shawn Dalton. Hey. Shawn, would you like to tell us a little bit about yourself, and the things that you like to make? Dear. He does not look very comfortable. No. Okay. Well, better yet, I'll explain. So, this is one of many things that Shawn likes to build. This particular birdhouse we like to call "Santa's House." Shawn, would you like to explain to us the first few steps? You have to say something. Okay... I got it. Okay, so you take these two pieces of wood... Dad! - It's funny. - It's terrible! ...and use the hammer, and nail right into here, like that, and here you have the start of your birdhouse. But I gotta give it to Patty. She really did a good job covering for Shawn. She really should have known better than to put him in that position. Yeah, well, I guess maybe she just thought that he was gonna be a natural, like she is. I mean, everybody does have their strengths. Yours is growing things, and Shawn's is working with his hands. Just... not on camera. Hey... Stage-fright Shawn left his axe. He's gonna need it to build the pallets. I'll take it to him. Great. Trade ya. Go down 40. Last house on the right. Copy that. You know, there is something about those two. I don't know. If only things were different. They're not. So we probably shouldn't go there. But we can go there. Hi! Howdy. Seems that you were missing this and your voice today on the show. Very funny, especially coming from the one who guest-starred on the flour blizzard the other day... Which I guarantee got better ratings. Yeah, can't argue with that. God, you sure know how to build things. I'm sure it can't be as impressive as those skyscrapers you get built. No, it is. I know. Would you like a tour? Yeah. - After you. - Okay. Whoa! That's amazing! Oh, this? Here... I blew the struts on my truck transporting these rocks, all 280 of them. What about all the logs? Hand cut, every single one. Really? Sorry. No, please, go ahead. Hi, Lorna! Ellie, you there? Yeah, can you see me? Nice craftsmanship. Where are you? Derek, hi. I'm... Where... Why are you in the office? He came in because we're in a bit of crisis. The community is filing a motion to block construction, so I need you to get back here ASAP. Okay... We can discuss strategy when I take you out for dinner. Okay, well, I just need a few days to wrap everything up... You have until Monday to get back here, Ellie. That's before Christmas. See you then. You sure are in demand. Yeah, well, it would appear that way. I should... I should go. But you haven't seen the best part yet. Come with me. Okay. It's quite something, huh? It really is. So, where do you go and think when you're in the city? Well, I have a park. The Malloy. It's about four blocks from my apartment. We have trees that are about a hundred years old. We have a pond. There's a family of ducks that comes by in the spring, sets up their nest. Swing set for kids, you know, it's great. It sounds nice. Yeah. It's not as nice as this. This probably is going to sound dumb, but when I was a kid, I used to think Patty was so cool 'cause she lived in town, and I was a farm girl, on a farm, growing plants. But I was really good at it, so everybody, including my dad, thought I was gonna take over the farm. That is why I did what any self-respecting teenager would do, and I rebelled. So... Now I just pave over everything I want to nurture and grow. Well, you know what they say. It's never too late to right a wrong. They do say that. Work beckons. Gotta go. Thank you for sharing this with me. Anytime. Let's decorate this thing, huh? Okay, everyone, thank you very much for coming. We really appreciate it. Let's hope we need you. And if not, we will celebrate like we do every year. That's understood? All right. Okay... let's see how many s'mores I get to eat. One... grab the tarp. Two... raise the tarp. And three, run with the tarp! It worked! Hey, everybody. We still have a whole lot of work to do. You ready? - Let's get to it. Okay, get the- get the crates, get the crates. Come on, come on, come on. They're perfect, they're perfect! They are perfect... Anyway, I was saying, if you want to take some of these to your mom, we've got a few extra, so feel free. A few over there... Yeah? - Got room? - No problem. All right, looks great. That's so terrible. That's the best kind of joke, though! That's it, that's the last load. Even the extra one for the parade? It's all done. So I guess the only thing left to do now is to celebrate! Yeah! Yeah, great, guys! Thank you so much! Thanks! Nice work. All right... Well, we did it. Or I should say, you did it. No, you were right the first time. In a few short months, the cuttings will be coming in, you'll have to do all this all over again. Just me? 'Cause I know I'm a jack of all trades, but you're kinda the expert around here. You know what you're doing. Sorry I'm late. I had to make the last batch of peppermint bark for the s'mores. But I saw the truck pulling in with all poinsettas. It's so exciting. Get it in there. Come on, come on, let's get daring. Hey... Hey. How you doing? I'm all right. I have to leave, Mom. Tomorrow. That's before Christmas and the parade. I have no choice. Everyone, could I just... have a minute? Okay, if any of you watch Patty's show, then you know how much I love to speak in front of an audience. So, I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all for really... keeping at it, and to share how grateful I am to have been given the opportunity to work on this farm. You've all shown me what it takes to create one of the most beloved symbols of the holidays, and in the process, you really made me feel like family. And then Ellie came home... and just when I thought I'd learnt everything I needed to know, she somehow taught me so much more. Most importantly, to not give up. Because just when you think you know how things are going to end, well... you never really do. So cheers! To the Palmers! Cheers! Okay, who wants to go on a... sleigh ride? Okay, now, this baby runs on Christmas cheer, so you have to sing really, really loud, okay? Everybody! Here we go! Find a seat! Go on up and help the kiddos get in there. Are you coming? Bye! Merry Christmas! You're really happy here, aren't you? Yeah, I am. So... my agent called me today, and he got me an offer to guest host twice a week on the Sara Lee show in Seattle, and, I want to go. That's really great, Patty. It is. Except I don't think that you would want to go. I'm sorry, Patty, but... This is where I've always wanted to be. Yeah. You know, I always knew your star would rise. Yeah? Yeah, of course. And you have a gift. Well, I think we all have a gift. Well... Oh, well... Good night, Shawn. Good night, Patty. Goodbye. Okay, so you got everything? I think so. All right. You know how much it kills me that you're not gonna be here for Christmas. I'll come next year, I promise. Love you. Love you, too. Be safe. Okay. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, my little bull. What did you think of my revised proposal? Well, it might appease the community, but it won't thrill the buyers. You see, the thing is, Ellie, people want more living space. You know, for bigger kitchens, TVs, ensuite baths. You know, kids, they don't play in yards and parks. They play organized sports that their parents drive them to, so this ideal of hanging onto green space is purely nostalgic, do you agree? I think there's some truth to that, but I also think it's... Yeah, so we agree, then. Good. You know, I'll talk to my people on the inside, and they can quash the resistance so you can finalize approval of the original proposal. Great. Cheers. Cheers. What are your Christmas plans? Christmas. I don't... I don't think I have any. Perfect. There's a great Asian fusion place over on Third. They're doing a truffled turkey. We should go. You know, that way we can continue this conversation about how we could best help one another. Because I think that we could, in a lot of ways. Do you agree? No. I beg your pardon? I really don't want a truffled turkey for Christmas. Well... I want my kids, that I may have one day, to grow up playing outside. I want them to feel the grass and the dirt beneath their feet. I want to watch something grow that's alive and real, not buildings. I'm... I am not a city girl. I'm not. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for dinner. Good luck. Grace? Hi! Yeah, can you come get me? I'm taking a red-eye. I'm coming home. Mom! Dad! I'm home! I'm back. - Sweetheart... - What are you... What is that? What did you just sign? I sold it, Ellie. Dad! No! We did it, we made the deliveries! That wasn't all it was about. Listen, I have run this farm for 40 years. I hate to admit it, but I'm tired. Your sister, Grace, she's not going to take over the place, and you've got your place in the city, so just... I don't anymore. I left it to come home. What? Ellie. We didn't know. I know. Patty... Listen... I know that I've made my own choices, and most of them were for the wrong reason... I always thought you looked down on me because I'm a farm girl. And I know, I know that that's not anything you ever did, that's just me, that's the way that I made myself feel. And I'm sorry. I belong here. Just like you belong on TV. Please, don't make me regret leaving. Look, you can have this. As long as we can come with a new agreement... That you be my poinsettia provider. Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! And-and we'll... do better than that. We'll be your poinsettia provider, and we will create a new hybrid called "Patty Poinsettia." Yes! I like that. Patty Poinsettia is cute. Okay. Well, Merry Christmas. - Bye. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - We'll talk later. I'll see you guys at the parade. - Okay. - Bye. Oh, my god! You really are back? I'm back, and this time, I'm not leaving. Hey, I'll tell you what, why don't you give us a tour of your new farm? Okay. I have ideas. I was thinking, I was thinking, at the beginning of this year, we could use... I am so glad you're finally home. You're going to be here when the baby arrives. I know, I'm so psyched. You know, Conway really is a great place to raise kids. All right, all right... Greg! Katherine! Mable, hey! Hi, Mable. I must say, I took a peek, and those plants this year, they are looking more beautiful than last. Well, I can't take any credit for that, I'm afraid. It all belongs to the farm's new owner, right there. Well! Now, you know I don't make sushi, huh? I know, I know, I'm coming to terms with it. All I need is your turkey sausage forever and ever. Well, I'll be. It's about time you came back home, Ellie. Thanks. You know, Mom, this looks like the perfect spot. Why don't we stop here? Get a good seat. We have to go to work. Let's do it. - Ready for this? - Yup. Hey. I brought you a hot dog. I figured you'd be hungry from all the work you were doing. Thanks, Patty. You're welcome. So I, found out that they want me in Seattle by the beginning of the new year. That's, that's quick. Yeah. So if I don't see you, Merry Christmas. Yeah, you too, Patty. Well, looks like you've got a parade to lead. I do. Hi. Bye, Patty. Bye. Hi, Patty! Hi! Hi, Patty! Hey, here, let me give you a hand up. Thanks, Dad. Yup! Good luck! What about you? No, no, this year, it is all about you, sweetheart. No, you can't make me do this alone! You're not doing it alone. I'm driving the truck! I wanna... I wanna drive! I wanna drive. Can't hear you! Sorry! Dad, you know I hate crowds! I can't be on TV... Hey, Greg. Hey! Ellie? Hi! What? What are you doing here? I'm-I'm back. For Christmas, or... No, no, for good. I'm back. Seriously? So you're not... You're not going back to the city? Just to pack. Okay... Would you hop up on the float? She'll tell you all about it. We gotta be in a parade! Okay. So you're really staying. Yeah. I guess my dreams never changed. You know, there was one thing about mine that I didn't tell you about, and that was... finding a girl to share them with. Well, then... Patty's a really lucky girl. Patty, yeah... Hang on. Just... Patty and I broke up. Yeah. You know, we were never really right for each other. So you're not... No. No, she's got to go chase her dreams, and me, well... the last piece of mine is standing right in front of me, on this float, in little Conway, Maryland. Come here. Oh, my gosh... Mommy! Yeah, honey. - Look! - Yeah, I see them... No, it's Daddy! Rick? Oh, my god! You're home! This might be the best Christmas ever. I think we can top it next year. Yeah? Yeah, throw in a few Dalton traditions? - What do you think? - Let's do it. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
