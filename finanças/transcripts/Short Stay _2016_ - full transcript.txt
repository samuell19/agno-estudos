Hello, Villa Rosa. Nope, we don't deliver there, just in New Jersey. Haddonfield, Haddon Township, Collingswood, Vorhees sometimes. Nope, not Philly. All right. Sorry. Bye-bye. - Hey, here to pick up. - What's your order number? I don't know what to write. Just write, "Get well soon". - I'm going to take a walk. - Okay. If I don't see you later, don't forget to feed the dog. The instructions are on the fridge. What time? Sometime in the morning before noon. Are you working tomorrow night? No, I'm off. Can I have another seltzer? Here, Angus. Hey, Angus. Angus? Angus! Hey, Angus. Angus! - Hey. - Hey, Mike. - Would you give me a hand with these? - Sure. So, where are we going? - Want to get a drink? - Sure. Our car's over here. - What's in the bags? - Just stuff from my grandma's. I might have to borrow a few bucks, but you owe me from last time, so... I got it. - You're not hiring, are you? - No, sorry. That's five. - You bartend? - I need a job. Próst. Oh, sorry. Cheers. So, how are you? - Are you allergic to cats? - I am, why? My aunt has a cat she's giving away I'm looking for a new home for her. I could see if anyone wants one. She's a great cat. Kind of old and grouchy, though. I might take her myself, but I wanted to see if anyone else would first. She's really sweet, though. Do you want to go to my friend's hockey game? - Whose? - Rob Fini. He plays in the adult league. There's a game tonight. I don't know. I'm kind of tired. It's usually pretty empty. It's fun. I think I'm just going to go home. Can I get my stuff from your car? - Do you wanna ride? - Yeah, sure. Hey, Rob. Mike, I told you I don't want to see you again. What don't you get about that? I want nothing to do with you. I apologized. I don't care what you did. Stay the hell away from me. Sorry. Yeah, look what you made me do What are you doing?! - I work here, I'll get you a new one. - You've already done enough as it is. Thanks a lot. Have a great day. Mike, delivery. All right. - Hey, Mike. - Hey, Mark. - How's it going? - Good. - I'm having dinner with my parents. - It's $18.95. - Hi, Mike. - Hey. So, you're working at the Villa Rosa now? - Yeah. - Good, good. - Good to see you. - Take it easy. Here you go. Keep the change. - See you. - I'll see you later. Bye. Oh, Mike! I'm having a party on Friday at my house in Philly, - if you want to stop by. - What time? - Around eight or nine. - I'm try to make it. Great. All right, see you. Hey, Cal! - Hey, Mike. - You working? No, I just got off work. - Wanna watch TV? - I can't, I have to go home. They handed me this card with some blessing written on it, and then he rubbed his fingers together and asked for money and I thought it was suspicious that a Buddhist would do that. So, I handed him his card back and walked away and didn't think anything more of it. But I was talking to Alastair later and he said, "Yeah, haven't you read this exposé in The Times "about these fake Buddhist monks scamming New Yorkers?" And I thought, "Wow, that is a great idea. "I could move to Tokyo and walk around dressed as a priest "and walk up to people, like, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with you,' "and then hit them up for money for my exotic Western religion." You know, take advantage of my white heritage. I don't know, man, I don't know where that came from. - Hey, Dan. - Hey, Mike. Good to see you, thanks for coming. You've been here before, right? No. First time. Oh, well, uh, welcome. Thanks. Help yourself to a drink, there's beer in the fridge. Sometimes it's what you have to do, to take care of it. - You just wait and see. - Cool. Um, I think I'm gonna go over to the fridge and get some beers. - Did you want one? - Sure. Excuse me. Did you want a beer? - No, I'm good. - Okay. - You look bored. - I'm just tired. - Well, I'm Marta. - I'm Mike. Nice to meet you. How do you know Mark? - Went to high school together. - Cool. You know him? I do! I almost took a job working for his business, but I ended up finding a job that was more up my alley. - Where do you work? - Um, in Jersey, um... - in an abortion clinic. - Oh, I'm from Jersey. Yeah? Where? - Haddonfield. - That makes sense. Why? Because you're friends with Mark. - How's the job? - It's really good. The work itself is great. But, you know, the commute gets a little long, but it's worth it. - Do you drive? - No, I bike part of the way and then I take the train and then I bike the rest of the way to work. Hey, Mike, thanks for coming. Do you know Mike? Yeah, we just met. - Oh, great. - What's up? - Nothing. Got my ticket today. - What are you seeing? - I'm going to Poland. - He's going to Poland. - I wish I could go. - I got this big tax return this year and I'm going for a few months. Actually, I'm trying to sublet my apartment, in case you know of anybody. - For how long? - A few months. - I might. - Really? Would you also maybe be interested in doing the tours for me? It's not that hard, I could train you. - Maybe. - Think about it. If we're going to talk about Philadelphia in the 1970s, we have to talk about the Broad Street Bullies and the Broad Street Bullies, that was the nickname for our hockey team, the Philadelphia Flyers, in the 1970s. Now, they were nicknamed that because not only were they good at playing hockey, but they were good at beating people up. And none was better than their captain, Bobby Clarke, who led the team to two Stanley Cup victories. Now, after they would win their games and after they would win their fights, they would go party at a bar over in New Jersey, called Rexy's. Now, Rexy's was supplied by the National Product, this very building. And, so, as a gift to their pals over at the National Product building, Bobby Clarke decided he would pay the employees a visit after one of their Stanley Cups. And my mom, who was a big fan, of course, was very excited. She swooned a bit. She said of him that he was, quote, "pretty cute when he had teeth", and at this time he still had his teeth. So, Bobby Clarke came and she prepared the only way she knew how, by getting him an ice cream cake. And Bobby Clarke came. He took the ice cream cake. He was very polite. They posed for a picture with it. But then afterwards, she became mortified because she realized that Bobby Clarke was not going to eat that ice cream cake, because Bobby Clarke doesn't eat ice cream cakes at all. Bobby Clark is diabetic. And that usually gets a laugh. But he was polite. So, that's the first tour. It's pretty straightforward. I can show you the second one after this. - How much do you usually make? - It depends. - Hello. - Hi. - What is this? - It's Free & Friendly Tours. It's a free walking tour of the city. Free walking tour. How long is it? - It's 40 minutes. - When does it start? - Five. - Awesome. So, Bobby Clarke of the Philadelphia Flyers, also known as the Broad Street Bullies, came to visit my mother here. He still had his teeth at the time, so she swooned a bit, though was pretty nervous. She did what any reasonable person would do. She bought him an ice cream cake. He came. He... She gave him the ice cream cake, they took a picture together and he left. But when he left, she was extremely nervous and mortified to find out Bobby Clarke was diabetic. He was never gonna eat the ice cream cake. He was just trying to be polite. So, we do a lot of shows at schools and it was like, "I'm deaf, but I overcame obstacles." - Hey, guys. - Hey, Mike. This is Leslie. We went to college together. We're just catching up. - Nice to meet you. - Cool. Uh, should we go? Sure. Do you want to invite Mike? Mike! Hey, we're gonna go get a drink. - Do you wanna come? - Yeah. Let me just change my T-shirt. All right. People like to complain a lot, about the air conditioning, about how they're sitting directly beneath the fan. And there's no way every seat in the theater is underneath the fan! - They like, love it so much, they... - Yeah. I don't know. Hey, you guys here for the tour? - Yes. - Sorry I'm late. - I'm Mike. - Mike, I'm Lou. - I'm Alistair. - I'll be your tour guide. - Great. - Awesome. So, this is Jim's Steaks, home of the cheesesteak, which is steak, fried, with cheese and onions on a roll. So, that's the tour. It's a tip-based tour company, so whatever you can spare is great. - All right. - Let me see what I've got. - Wow. - Oh, man, I... - I don't have anything left. - Ah. Wait, Alistair, I think there's an ATM down there. - You wanna go? We'll be right back. - Yeah. All right. It's a good idea. - Thanks, Mike. - No problem. Hey, Mike. - See the new tattoo I got? - No. Yeah, I got it in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago. Hair's still growing in, it really itches. It's by this Fren... German guy. Early 20th... Yeah, early 20th century. So, like, early 1900s, World War I era. He actually died in World War I, got shot in the head before they could recall anybody. You know, to preserve that German history. I bought mousetraps. Yeah, I thought I heard some, like... some noises in my room the other day. Could've... Definitely could've been a mouse. I mean, there's all those dishes in the sink. Maybe if you do them, like, a little bit more often, there wouldn't be, you know, droplets, little droppings around the stove and under the fridge. It's kind of... unhygienic, I think, to live in. Mike? Hey, Mike. I'm Liz. - I don't know if you remember me? - No, sorry. We met at Phil's birthday party at that bar in the Northeast. - When was that? - Last Fall, I guess. Oh, right, you're a friend of Phil's. Yeah, sort of. But I was there because somebody else invited me. How are you? It's funny running into you. I'm good. Good. What are you doing? What's this? "Free and Friendly Tours"? It's my friend's walking tour company. I'm giving tours for him while he's away. It's in Old City, I just gave one. You should take one some time. Oh, that's great. Yeah. Maybe I'll take one some day. I was just visiting my sister. She lives near South Street. Where do you live? On Moore Street. At Mark Simmons's apartment. - He's a friend of mine. - Oh, I don't think I know him. Well, I don't want to bother you too long. I guess I'll let you get back to work. It was nice running into you. - Yeah, you too. - Take care. Liz! Liz! Liz! - Oh, hey. - Hey. You wanna see a movie tonight or tomorrow? Sure. Let me think. I might have a thing. What? No. Sorry, I thought I might be getting dinner with this guy I'm seeing. But, no, I think I can go. What time were you thinking? - What did you think of the movie? - I liked it, what did you think? I thought it was a good historical drama. - Such a nice night out. - Mm. Do you want to get a cup of coffee? Do you want to get some coffee? Sorry. I got a message from Bob. I should probably call him back. I should get going. I'm sorry. Mm. All right, bye. - Thank you! - Okay. Shit, it's late. You don't happen to have a car to give me a ride, do you? No, I don't. You could stay at my place. - I could? - Yeah. That'd be nice. It's just that the train takes forever this late. I live right around here. Oh, okay! I didn't know we were in your neighborhood. We should've just gone to your place for a drink instead of wasting our money here. Oh, I didn't think of that. That's okay. You sure you have a place for me? Did you sleep? No, not really. I thought when you invited me over here that you had a couch or something. I didn't mean to put you out or make you sleep on the floor. It's okay. I've gotta go to Villa Rosa to pick up a check I haven't got yet. You're going to New Jersey? - Yeah. - Yeah. I should probably get going too, see what Bob's up to. I'm gonna shower, then we can go. Okay. Wait. Let me use the bathroom first. All right. So, it's about a minister and his wife and their four girls who go to the Congo in, like, 1960, as, like, you know, evangelicals. It's really, it's a good book. It's really good. - And you're teaching this at school? - Yeah. Yeah. Just this year. Oh, how's the tour guide and all that going? - Good, good. - You likin' it? Yeah. Are you going to be able to continue when Mark gets back? I'll talk to him about it. Not sure at the moment. Okay. And what about, do you, like, get to know other tour guides and...? - No, it's not really... - Not like that. Okay. - Hey, Cal. - Hey, Mike. How you been? It's been a while. Yeah. Good. Where have you been? - I've been living in Philly. - What are you doing there? Working for Mark Simmons's walking tour company. Oh, cool. - Wanna do something? - Sure. Want to play Scopa? - I'd love to. - You remember how to play, right? I do not. How can you not remember how to play? Come on, I'll show you. Since you swept the cards on the table once, that's one point for you. I swept them twice, which is two points. Since I have more than 20 points, that's one card for me. And with the seven of coins, that's another point. I have six cards and coins. So, that's one point for me. For the prime, you have 21, 42, 60, 78. And I have, um... ..76, so, that's... one point for you, which is five points for me. And two for you. So, you win? No, now we play another hand until someone has 11 points. Hey, Mike. - Are you doing anything tonight? - No. We're going to go down to Minny & Phil's later, if you want to come? - No, I'm good. I'm going to stay in. - Right. - Hi. - Hi. I'm trying to get to Rittenhouse Square and somebody told me, - I think it's this way? - I don't really know. I don't want to lead you the wrong way. But I think it's that way to the left. That way... Like, here to the left? - Yeah. - Thank you. Hey, Mike! It's Marta, remember? Oh, yeah, I remember. So, you actually sent him in the opposite direction, but he'll figure it out eventually. I'm always forgetting my north and south. I do that too, sometimes. Maybe you should get a compass. Actually, we're having a party at my house tonight. - Where is it? - It's in West Philly. Oh, I'll give you the address. There you go. So, you're the first one here. Feel free to take a seat. - This is Mike. - Hi, Mike, nice to meet you. - Hi. - Mike is subletting for Mark and Meg just got back from her aunt's. Do you want anything to drink or...? - Some water. - Okay. Sounds good. You have a loft. - Anybody live up there? - No. Do you ever make out up there? Yeah. I'm sure somebody has! No, we mostly use it just for storage. Here you go. - Do we have any salsa? - Yeah, it's on the counter. Okay. - How's Mark's? - Good. You been? Uh, no, I don't really know him. I met him when he came over here once. What do you do? I'm a stage crew at the Wilma? - Where's that? - On Broad Street, near the Kimmel Center. All right - all ready! Ah, I'll get it. Either way, the film is... is already well underway by the time they come and sit down right in front of me. As soon as he sits down. Was he scabby? I couldn't quite tell, it was very dark. A profile, you couldn't see? But he's just obsessively pawing at his own face, for minutes on end. And I'm thinking... "This has got to be enough." And then, no, it's another minute of rubbing his nose... Hey, Cal. Hey, Mike. - I haven't seen you in a while. - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Just out for a walk. - Can I come? - Sure. - Usual route okay? - Yeah. I found this wallet on the ground. - Where? - I was taking a nap and I rolled over and it was next to me when I woke up. - Where were you taking a nap? - On the street. Like a homeless guy? - Was there any money in it? - No. What should I do with it? Let me have it. I'll make sure to get that to the owner. So, I heard you converted to Roman Catholicism. Yeah, I did. I actually went in to speak to the local parish priest about it for the first time, and we talked it over in his office, and he really took to me right away. Ten minutes after he met me, he asked, have I ever thought about being a priest? You know, when I'm not even Catholic. And I just said, "Let's slow down. Let's wait until I'm confirmed before I think about being a priest. One second at a time. Then, the next day, I was reading the parish bulletin. There was this announcement about a special mass of healing and anointing they have coming up and there was some information in there about the sacrament of anointing, and it said in big, bold black letters, you know, "This sacrament is not for people who have died." And I feel like if I knew the story behind that, about what happened at a previous mass of healing and anointing, that would be enough to make me think twice about being a priest. - What are you doing here? - I'm locked out. I lost my key. Oh, I'll let you in. So, I just got an e-mail from Mark. He said he's gonna be back earlier than he thought. - Oh, yeah? - Like this week, probably. - Really? - Yeah. - Do you know what day? - No, I don't. Well, I paid for the month, so... You'll just have to talk to Mark about that. He just wanted me to tell you when he'll be back is all. - I wonder why he didn't tell me. - I don't know. You didn't see a box of CDs by the closet door, did you? Think so, why? Do you know where it is? - The box? - Yeah. - I threw it out. - You threw it out? Yeah. Did you throw the CDs out too, or just the box? I threw out the CDs and the box, last week on Trash Night. - Was I not supposed to do that? - I wasn't throwing them out. Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do to replace them, maybe? To make it up to you? You should have asked me before just throwing them out. They were mainly albums by my friends. I doubt you could replace them. I mean, I know they were by the trash, but they were definitely not trash. I kind of can't believe you'd do that. I don't know, I maybe give you a hard time about the mouse shit the other day, but when I said you could be a little cleaner, I didn't mean you should throw out all my shit. I'm sorry. It's fine. Whatever. Just ask me, next time, okay? Okay. He said that after they took him to that back room, he didn't remember anything else that night but that, the next morning, his pants smelled like "regret". - He was quite a card. - Yeah, sounds fun. - Hey, Mike! - I got some soft pretzels. Oh, thanks. How's it going? - Good, how was the trip? - Oh, it was great. Poland is great. You should go sometime. - How were the tours? - Not too bad. Mainly fine. Nice. Thank you so much for doing that while I was away. - I really appreciate it. - Yeah. And I'm sorry I came back early. - I hope that's not going to be a problem. - As long as I can stay. I mean, it wouldn't be a big deal if you left, right? It's not like we have a couch or anything, you know? I'm going to need the money back then. Oh! Um... So, the reason I came back early is that I'm broke, so... So, you're kicking me out and not giving me the money back? No, Mike! I'll give you the money back at some point, probably, but, just, it can't be now. I'm sorry. It'd be easier if we had a couch, you know, there's just no room in here, you know? I'll stay in your room, then. I don't think so. - I'll stay in here. - Where? - In the kitchen? - Yeah, floor. - On the floor? - Yeah. Yeah, you wouldn't get any sleep in here, Mike. I think you should just find your own place. I need the money. You're not even supposed to be here, so... Mike, this is my apartment. I'm on the lease. - He has a point. - I'm not leaving. All right, we need to talk about this later. We're going to dinner. We have some friends to meet and catch up, but we'll talk later, okay, Mike? So, the day I arrived, I hadn't heard anything from my host all day. Like, we had confirmed this, weeks before, but she didn't get back to me. So, I was checking Wi-Fi nonstop and it was getting pretty late, so, I was, like, hanging out at McDonald's or KFC, whatever I could find. And I finally got in touch with her, or she got in touch with me, at six, and said that I had to be there at 6:45, because she had to go for the night for a concert. So, I, like, rushed over there. I caught a couple of trains and I got there just in time. And it was fine, like, she seemed pretty nice, but, every single night, something went wrong. Like, she was out of touch the first night, so, I had to wait for her to come back to get inside. And then, the second night, she gave me a key, but had locked the screen door. So, I had to wait, like, at a nearby cafe until like 3am, until she got back, finally. Can you just explain to me what I need to do? You need to tell me? No, I don't. Look, I just got back, we haven't seen each other in a while, I like being single. This can't just be it. It is. Mark, I care about you and what you're thinking. I am trying to fix the problems, but I don't know the solutions. That's because there aren't any problems. Look, I didn't ask you to stay. I need to get to work. - Hey, Mark. - Hey. Look, there aren't any problems. You haven't done anything wrong. - I just need to be alone. - You had five months alone! Yeah, and it was great. You are such an asshole. You want me to do a tour? Uh, no, Mike. I got it. How about this afternoon's? Yeah, I'll do that one too. - See you later, Mike. - Bye. Hey, I think I left something here. Can I come look for it? Hey, what's going on? Liz left something here. This is Liz. Hey, I'm Liz. I'm sorry. I thought I left a ring here, but I can't find it. I'm sorry. Oh, that's quite all right. I'll help you look. I just got back. Are you a friend of Mike's? Yeah. Sort of. Oh, yeah. I've been traveling. I was in Poland. He was just staying here while I was away. Oh, cool. I've never been. Yeah. You should go. It's great. Go in spring. - Oh... - It's nice in spring. I had no idea. Where were you, in Poland, mainly? Krakow, mainly. Thanks for letting me stay here. No problem. So, Mark just kicked you out? Yeah, I tried sleeping on the floor, but I couldn't sleep. Did you find out why he came back so suddenly? He ran out of money. I wish he could have said something to me, so I wasn't waiting for him here. Do you know how long you'll stay here, Mike? I'm not sure. It depends on what's going on with the tours. Well, you can sleep on this couch or you can go up in the loft. - I can? - Yeah! Just don't fall out or anything. Did someone do that? Yeah, Peter fell out a couple months ago, remember? He was... When he was crashing here. Apparently, he moves around a lot in his sleep. And, so, I heard a crash in the middle of the night and, when I came out, he was, he was on the floor. Oh, yeah! Where was I? I don't know, sound asleep. Well, speaking of which, I'm going to go to sleep soon. I'll get you some sheets and a pillow, Mike. Thanks. - How did you sleep? - Good. - Mike, do you want any coffee? - Coffee, please. It's on the counter over there. Oh, Marta, this came for you yesterday. Ooh! - It's from my grandmother. - Tell us what it says! I think it's in Polish, so I'd have to translate it, but I got to get going anyway. I'll see you guys later. Bye! Well, I gotta leave in a minute too, actually. - Do you have work today? - I'm not sure, I gotta talk to Mark. - Where do you work? - I work at the Wilma, I'm stage crew. We're doing Hamlet right now. Actually, let me go get you the spare keys. I'm not sure where they are, I can't find them. I think maybe Marta moved them. It's okay. I just don't have another set, so I guess maybe stay here unless you know you're going to be out later than Marta and me? Okay, cool. Actually, let me give you my number, in case Marta doesn't pick up. - There you are. - Okay, thanks. I should be home around seven. - See you. - Bye! Hey, Mark. Hey, Mark! - Hey, Mike. - Hi. - Hey, how's it going? - Good, how you doing? I didn't see you last night. Did you go move back home? - No, I stayed at Marta's. - Oh, Marta! How's she doing? Good, good. I want to talk to you about something. Um, can it wait? I got this tour right now. No-one's here. Look, Mike, now that I'm back, I don't need you to do the tours any more. So, you're firing me. No, I'm not firing you, but... I just don't need you to do them any more. I helped you out for five months. What are you doing? Mike, can we talk about this later, please? You're being such an asshole right now. I don't have time for this. What are you doing?! Are you trying to hit me? You're not going to hit me. Nobody hits me. Nobody. So, there's this part in the show where dirt falls from the sky, and it's, like, this, like, fake, like, uh... fake dirt, it's, like, ground-up tire bits. Anyway, it's a pain in the butt, cause you first have to, like, lower in these big dirt bags and then have to fill them up with fake dirt and then you have to hoist them back out again and they're, like, really heavy and messy, 'cause, like, the dirt falls on your face. And it's...messy... So, it sounds like you're out of a job? I guess. I might go tomorrow and apologize. You're gonna go back and see if he changed his mind? - Yeah, what else can I do? - I don't know. Look for another job? - Want some of this? - What is it? - Mac and cheese? - Sure. Okay, I'll go get you a plate. - Hey, guys! - Hi, Marta. Hey, how was your day? Oh, nothing out of the ordinary, but since I had, like, the weirdest thing happen on the bus just now. - What? - Some dude almost followed me home. - Fuck, let me deal with this. - What is it? It's Mark, he came over to talk. Just don't answer the door. Hold on. Just don't answer it. Let him stand there. It's Mark. Oh, just don't pick it up. Just let it ring. I think he came over to apologize. You know he just feels bad. Yeah. Okay, he's going away. - I feel kind of bad about this. - Don't. So, tell me about this guy on the bus. So, I was coming in from Center City just now and that dude who found my cellphone a couple weeks ago, he came on the bus and sat next to me and started hitting on me. So, Meg and I are going to this picnic meet-up thing in Fairmount Park today. Are you... Did you want to come with us? Sure. I don't have a bike, though. Oh. Um... I'm trying to think if I know of anyone who has a bike you can borrow, but... - It's okay, I can walk. - Are you sure? It's kind of far. - Yeah, it's okay. - Okay. Well, if you're going to walk from here, you're going to go down the street to 52nd Street, and then you're going to turn to the right and you're just going to keep going straight for a while. And then you'll eventually hit, like, a busy intersection. So, you want to cross there and you should be at the entrance. It'll take you, like, 45 minutes. - Are you walking? - Yes. - Are you sure you want to walk? - Yeah, it's fine. Okay! Um, well, we'll meet you at the entrance at 52nd Street, then. - Okay. Bye. - See you! - There he is. - Hey. That was far. So, change of plans. What? Well, we're early. The meet-up we were supposed to go to is actually next week. What are we going to do? We figured that since it's nice that we're already here, we'd walk around and spend the day here? - You look tired. - I'm crashing. I drank too much coffee. Wake me up when you guys are leaving. I think this is my first time here. I thought I'd been here before. - Who was that? - I don't know. - That was funny. - Mm-hm. Hey, can I ask you for a favor? Sure. I'm going to go back my mom's, but I need to get some stuff at Mark's first. But I can't get a hold of him and I lost my key. Could you come to one of the tours with me so I can talk to him? Why do you need me to come? I don't know. I just can't talk to him alone after the last time. Yeah. I just need to go there to get my clothes so I can get back to New Jersey. Sure. When do you want to go see Mark? - Whenever, when did you want to go? - Right now? I have a couple things I need to wrap up first. But could we do later in the afternoon? - Sure. - Okay. - Oh, hey, guys. - Hey, Mark. - What's going on? - I need my stuff back. I lost my keys. Oh, why don't you just stop by any time? - When's best? - Uh, I don't know. - Give me a call, okay? - Your phone's been off, though. Oh, yeah, sorry, I've been really busy. Um... How about... How about four o'clock today? Does that sound good? Hey! - I got you a coffee. - Thanks so much. - The way I like it? - Yeah, of course. You're the best. Thanks. - Hey, Mike! - Uh, this is Liz. - Pleased to meet you. - Anyway, so, I got to get to this tour. I'll see you later, okay? Let's go. - Thanks for doing that with me. - Sure. That was really weird, though. Who was that girl? Liz! She lives in New Jersey. - Do you know her? - I do. Anyway, I'm going to go run some errands, but I'll see you later. - What are you doing? - Looking for something. - What? - A cup. - What kind of cup? - A Phillies cup. I don't see it. Just don't take any of my stuff. I think it got mixed in with yours. I'll try not to.
