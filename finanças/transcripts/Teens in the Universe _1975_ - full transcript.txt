Mishka's taken my place. What's this row? Mind your table manners. C'mon, sit down, sit down. We've gathered here today to mark the fortieth birthday of our Pavlik, who 27 years ago flew off to the far-off Cassiopeia constellation. Each year, we gather at this table. We're doing our best to keep everything here as it was when our Pavlik lived in this room. Though now he is already Pavel Kondratyevich Kozelkov. The briefcase, with which P.K. Kozelkov loved to go to school The nails P.K. Kozelkov loved to hammer in Visitors' Book Let's drink to good luck, so that it should always accompany our Pavlik in everything. Who are you? Please excuse my sudden intrusion, but I deemed it my duty to congratulate your family with the birthday of Pavel Kondratyevich Kozelkov, the first pilot of ''Dawn''. Excuse me, but who are you? Well, I know who he is. How should I explain it... I'm performing special duties in this whole story. Listen, pal... - I'm, you know, A.S.A. - What? Acting specially as. A.S.A. In my line of duty, I was closely connected to the crew of ''Dawn'' and, particularly, to your son, dear Antonina... Don't be shy. You see, I'm tangible, quite material, so everything's all right. Dear Antonina Alekseyevna and Kondraty Panteleimonovich. Why are you having 40 candles here? Pavlik was 13 when he flew away. It was 27 years ago. 27 plus 13... What a childishly naive conclusion. Come on, count them. 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1 1 , 12, 13... 14. 14. 14! Just 14, dear Irina Kondratyevna. - Einstein's paradox. - What? - Einstein's paradox. - So what? While here, on Earth, 27 years pass, less than a year passes over there. Einstein's paradox. What does he have to do with it? Mikhail Kondratyevich is absolutely right, it's Einstein's paradox. May I remind you that it was the idea of the expedition's head, Viktor Danilovich Sereda, to form the crew of teenagers no older than 14, so that they could reach Cassiopeia in the prime of their life, about 40 years old. But an incredible thing happened. The ship broke through the hyperspace and reached its destination 27 years earlier than the calculated... - Time! - Absolutely right. There's nothing we can do about the paradox, we've been hearing about it since Pavlik left. But I just cannot believe that Pavlik is younger than Misha, who was only 3 then. Oh, women! Nevertheless, my dear Antonina Alekseyevna, today, there or over there, in the depths of space, your son has turned just... - Forty. - Fourteen! A paradox. Too many temptations. How about a picnic amid nature? A birthday in our own simulated nature. We'll sunbathe, we'll sing, we'll fix a barbecue. We need something more ceremonial. After all, it's the first birthday on the ship. At least, in some room. Guys, let's do it in his flat, like on Earth. - Well, it's not a bad idea. - Great! Let's simulate Pavel's flat. Don't forget about a samovar and a white cat. - Write it down. - I already did. And I've got something here for the sound effects. - Three... four. - Please! Mom, will we have compote today? Yes, Misha dear. - What about jelly? - We'll have jelly tomorrow. And ice cream? No ice cream, you all got sore throats. Children, who took my magazine? I'm sure it's Pashka. And he's late for dinner as usual. Where's Pavlik? I'm here, Mom, Dad! Help me slice the bread and put the plates on the table. Those Pashka's nails are all over the table again. Fedya, I'm sorry you have to do it. Happy birthday! Sorry, we wanted to please you. lt was a stupid joke. But take it easy, you're a grownup man now. - No, not grownup. - Yes, grownup. If you'd stayed on Earth, you would have been 40 already. Old man. We must swear right now that we'll never play such jokes on one another, that we'll never remind each other of home, our home on Earth, so that we never felt such an excruciating nostalgia, so that memories never weakened our will. I swear. I swear. I swear not to remember. I swear. I swear. - I swear. - But it's impossible! Impossible not to remember the Earth, your home, your family. Those are the dearest things we got. Childhood will remain here forever, on the planet we're heading for. As the ship commander, on behalf of the earthmen, I exempt you from this oath for tonight. - Intimacy is welcome. - Anything for the crew. Come on, ''The night is gone''. The night is gone, as the pain is gone, Earth is asleep, yes, let her rest. The Earth has to go a way as long As life, as we have to go in our quest. I'll take along this big world, Every day, every hour that has passed. Should l forget something, The stars may not accept us. Should I forget something, The stars may not accept us. I'll take the memory of fields wide and far, I'll swim in the ripe, thick hay. And there, far off, by the blue star, The Earth's Sun will light my way. I'll take along this big world, Every day, every hour that has passed. Should I forget something, The stars may not accept us. Should I forget something, The stars may not accept us. Twenty seven years ago, the spaceship ''Dawn'', which is a Russian acronym of ''annihilator relativistic nuclear starship'', took off from Earth towards Alpha Star in Cassiopeia Constellation, also known as Schedar. As you know, after the ship left the Solar system, we lost all communication with it. For 27 years, all our efforts to locate the ship and contact it have been in vain. However, last night, at 18:57, we succeeded in not only locating the ship, but even having a direct television hook-up with them. All the members of the expedition are in good health, the ship's systems are in working order. The starship is approaching Schedar, that is, the target of its flight. What 27 years ago was just a tentative hypothesis, is beyond any doubt today. The Schedar star's system has a planet inhabited by intelligent creatures. Moreover, our laboratory has deciphered the signals coming from that planet. There has been a catastrophe there that threatens to destroy civilization. What has happened is not clear. But the thinking creatures are in danger from someone. Children's magazine ''Pif''. I would like to know when you'll have another connection with the starship. I cannot answer that question. We have waited 27 years for today's connection. There it is, Alpha in Cassiopeia. The signals come from the second planet of the Alpha system. Apparently, these are the signals of the disaster the Earth had anticipated. Here is the planet. It looks so much like our Earth. What do you think, guys, where our Earth can be now? I didn't ask about my home, I just asked about Earth. That's the same. Just approximately, where is it now? - We can't even see the Sun from here. - Approximately. Approximately, over there. But given the curvature of space, it's there. Or there. Stop fooling. We're entering the sphere of planetary gravitation. What awaits us on this planet? If only we could know who's sending the signals. We thought we'd arrive here already as grownups. Why getting in the dumps? The sooner we arrive, the sooner we leave. - Wise man. - Aristotle. Alright, let's get serious. All go to your work places. Fix the parameters of circular orbit, with account of atmospheric density. Check the manual controls. Is it so difficult to choose those three? It is. I hope you understand that I have to fly under any circumstances? I understand. Sereda, I hope you understand that in any case I must fly with the first reconnaissance capsule? Why you? Vitya, I'm an exobiologist. Should there be an encounter with intelligent creatures, I must meet them first. Yes, I guess you're right. Thanks. Switch off, Lob, Vitya's still thinking. Vitya, I hope you understand that in any case I have to fly. Why? You ask, we answer. I'm the only specialist in extraterrestrial civilizations. Who can tell a pulsating homunculus from a twinkling octosaur? Secondly, I invented a unique glue, and my resourcefulness... Block him. Vitya, we hope you understand... Alright, go. I have to think it all over again. - Yes, Commander. - Don't consult with the computer. He is at bad terms with it. You should look beautiful when you step onto an alien planet. You're so lucky. I didn't think Vitya would send you. - Anyone but you. - Why not? You know how he feels about you. When we were in the 4th grade, he stole your photo. I gave it to him. And not in the 4th, but in the 5th. All right, he didn't steal it. Julia's right, you're lucky. If Misha looked at me the way Vitya looks at you, I would have died from happiness. I prefer people who give no sign of what's going on inside them. Because you're too secretive yourself. But one can't hide anything from me, I've got eyeglasses. All right, girls, we're not on Earth. On Earth or not on Earth, I cannot hide anything. All is written on my face, and he can see it. But he looks only at you. Guns are in pockets behind your seats. Thanks. Kuteishchikova is late even now. She's coming. - Well, good luck. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - I'll call her Varyana. - Who? - That planet. - Why Varyana? Varya. Varyana. You'll be the first to step on it. I won't be alone to step on it. Well, call it whatever you like, even Juliana. I don't care. Goodbye. Goodbye. Pasha, we'll be on line all the time. Goodbye. Let's go. - How are you? - Everything's great. Good luck! You're leaving the zone of visibility. We'll contact you in 55 minutes. - What's this? - Some kind of top toys. We're observing a rare case of spindle-like civilization. These structures indicate that the planet was inhabited by the 6- legged, 8-winged dragonfly creatures. There's nothing funny about it. Why are you so quiet? You're the first humans on this planet. Man has never set foot in this place! We're the first here! - You've spoiled it again. - Why me? What a strange echo. Let's call this planet Echo. - Sounds good. - Echo! Echo! Vitya has called this planet Varyana. Well, let it be Varyana. And what's this? Obviously, these are the remnants of a civilization. But where from? They're the cubs of dragonfly creatures. They're absolutely harmless. Besides, they're just running by. - Anything fell off? - Nothing so far. - Maybe, my universal glue. - We don't need your glue. Then I'll take a run. - Where? - Over there. But be quick. We must not keep away from each other. Sure. All right, run. - Where're you going? - To play some soccer. - No kidding. - He needs to. We have reached the second planet of the Alpha-Cassiopeia system. The preliminary data on the atmosphere have been verified. O2 - 21%, H2 - 78%, CO2 - 1%. All is within the range of the earth standards. Wow, what a wind! We're observing the signs of an existing civilization, and, therefore, of thinking creatures. Though everything around looks rather deserted, so it's possible we're too late. I've been here. Lob. Humans? Just a minute, I'll turn on my thought detector. Where are you from? I'm from over there, I flew on this in here, to you. Earth, peace, friendship. The square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the catheti. It can happen to anyone. Peace, friendship! Where're you going, guys? Where to, guys? We shouldn't have let him go a step away. Just wait till I catch him! What's this? It's a third column already. Dying civilizations have always created graveside monuments. But where's Fedka? It's just an outrage. Now we have to waste time on searching him. We have to make a radio contact. There he is, our dear boy. Stop fooling. Stay cool, Varvara. We seem to have an encounter. Who are you? We're the executors. Follow us. The controllers are waiting for you. Where's Fedka? There's no danger. Your friend is already there. What's most important is not to show distrust. Go on with reporting inconspicuously. We're having a close encounter with the intelligent ones. The creatures looking like humans, their heads equipped with numerous metal details. Their means of communication is whistling. The human ear cannot... We're in a small white spherical premises... A prophylactic module. The walls are from something like our foam rubber or asbestos. The air in the room has no smell. What a profound silence. All is white, like in Julia's hospital. A trap? A trap for fools. Attention. I am ''Mainland'', calling ''Island''. ''Island''. Guys, do you copy? Varya, Pasha, Fedya. Varya, Pasha, Fedya. They left the capsule five hours ago. They didn't make contact at the appointed time. They absolutely disappeared from the planet's surface. An artificial body port side. Look, it's approaching. That's it, boys. - Civilization. - Too early to rejoice. What's this? I don't get it. It's a cannon. Guys, it's a cannon. Sure, a cannon. What do we do, Vitya? - Katya, give me a candy. - Here. Activating the protective system. Don't get nervous. lf necessary, the automation will work on its own. Only who will prove stronger? We? We must not show them our distrust. What about the cannon? That's something absolutely different. I'll go out into the demonstration module. All right. Try not to take extreme measures. Good luck. Humans. Just like us. I've always believed it. If there are intelligent creatures in space, they can only be like us. It can't be proved. You always dispute the obvious facts. We're gratified that we could have pleased you. Come to the ball. Where're you from? From the Solar system, from the planet Earth. Why have you come to us? You asked for help. We didn't ask help. You did, we received your signals. Those were not our signals. What do you mean, not yours? Not ours. We were looking for the intelligent in the Universe. - Thinking ones. - Live ones. Are you alive? Yes, alive. And we're thirsty. For this, you're given a control key, inserted in the niche. For you not to use your primitive instruments, we're switching to your speech code. - That's something! - All for the happiness of the alive. - Do you want to be happy? - Sure. You bet. You will be happy. We'll make you happy. Will make you happy. Will make you happy. Weird. - What's weird? - Everything's weird. Why do they say they didn't ask for help? Who sent the signals then? Or were we mistaken? What does it mean, ''make us happy''? I'm already happy. You happy? They'll make you even happier. I don't want to be made happy. One must win happiness oneself. - What's up? - Where's the chair? I think I did it. Give it here. A remote control system. It is our planet. It is the Earth's garden. The Earth feeds us, gives us water. We exist in this environment, we move, we breathe. But it is just a tiny model of a part of our planet. These are flowers, which will yield delicious fruit later. We call the fruit apples, cherries, pears. Please. Sending us on a distant journey, people created this room, in which we could make simulations of places that are dear to us, and they called that room ''a surprise''. We would like to know your alphabet. There you go. A, b, c, d, e... Now we would like to know your vocabulary. There you go. Abacus, abbot, abdomen, aberration, aborigine, absentee, abracadabra... Hell's bells. - They've assimilated it! - Yes, assimilated. Thank you. Please, sit down. We're happy to see our brothers in intellect. Now we shall tell you about our planet. This is what our planet looked like 250 years ago. We were happy and looking for new ways of development. Creative work was bringing us joy. The greatest invention of our scientists was the bio-technical executor robot, which liberated us from primitive working processes. Following the executor robot, the controller robot had been created, which was able to not only manage the executors, but perfect them, too. However, the controller robots decided also to improve us, the live ones. They believed that the achievement of full happiness by us is impeded by the torments of creative work, the feelings of dissatisfaction, compassion for others, kindness and conscience. They decided to deprive us of those qualities. We didn't want that kind of happiness. We began to fight back. But it was too late. All you see now does not exist any more. Only pictures remained. At the final stage of that planetary tragedy, the controller robots resorted to an awful craftiness. They created a call - an eerie mesmerizing combination of sounds, upon hearing which even the strongest of us lost all willpower and obediently went to the stations where they were turned to happy, senseless, complacent creatures. Those absolutely happy ones lived aimlessly through the rest of their lives, leaving no offspring after them, for they had also been deprived of the feeling of love. There is not a single live creature on our planet now. How could you survive? Shortly before the catastrophe, our scientists built and put in orbit a space radio observatory. We're the descendants of those who were on that orbital station and, thus, out of reach of the robots. Our observatory can't leave its orbit. We are doomed to forever orbit the planet that no longer belongs to us. For 250 years we have been sending SOS signals, and we're happy that you heard us. The smell. Our three comrades are there, on your planet. They're going to die. If they get the control key, we'll try to help you see each other. Square A-739-12 - minus. Square A-739-13 - minus, Sergei Sergeyevich. Square A-739-14 - minus. Minus, minus, minus... We need different solutions. We should look for something else. We're looking, but, unfortunately, we don't possess the energy necessary for covering such distances. I know it without your telling me. Excuse me for so unceremoniously intruding on your conversation. I'd like to be useful, for I have some resources, though, maybe, of not quite scientific nature. Of not quite scientific nature? Not quite, in the light of the present day. I would like to offer my services in order to contact the ''Dawn'' starship. - How? - When? Right now. Please. There we go. Capricorn, Cabalevsky, Centaur, Cryuchkov, Cristalinskaya... There it is, Cassiopeia. 555-666-777. Do you happen to have any metal object of medium size? No. - Will it do? - Just fine. We got it. What's this? The first contact of man with an extraterrestrial civilization. The inhabitants of Varyana. And where are the kids? Vitya? Vitya? Here he is, Viktor Danilovich Sereda. Excuse me, you've got strong tobacco. That's all I can do so far. I don't command the feedback yet. But... I'm thinking, searching, researching, hoping. The devil knows what. Try the crimson one, it's something like our mango. Let's try your mango. Cool. Well, up! - Hi. - Hi. Up! Here comes the mango. We expected a destroyed civilization, and what we got is just wow! Your mango stinks. It's just red ink. Where do these horned retorts come from? Can you not ask questions at least now? Please. There's a hole here. Interesting. The elementary action of a field of force. Try the yellow stuff, something like strawberries in chocolate. ''Island''. ''Island''. I'm ''Mainland''. I'm ''Mainland''. - Guys, do you copy? - We copy. We copy. Pasha! Pasha! Pasha, if you have the control key, hurry and put together the upper yellow plate and the red one, and then we shall see each other. ''Island''! I'm ''Mainland''. I'm ''Mainland''. You're in danger, you're surrounded by robots. Return to the ship immediately. To do this, insert the key in the niche, which must be in the room. Make a half-turn of the key's upper plate. After you connect the green and red plates... You're being deceived. You're in no danger. We'll make you happy. Will make you happy. It's all nonsense. Vitya is just panicking, he's jealous of us. No, he isn't panicking. Vitya wouldn't scare us just for nothing. The robots. - Come on, what's the matter? - We must leave. - Follow me. - Bye, robots. Danger. Danger. Varya, where're you? Batten down. Starting the engines. Hurry, Varvara. Why are you standing? Maybe we'd better not fly, guys? - What? - Are you tired of living? No, I'm not. But there're so many mysteries here, and we flee without solving them. If they're really robots, don't you want to know why they look so much alive, like humans? It's antihuman. And all the rest? Those balls, means of transportation, and the whole civilization? We've encountered what we were looking for, and now we chicken and flee. - Shall we bind her? - I've got Sereda's order. And what would Sereda have done if he were in our place? He would have stayed. - She's crazy. - I'm staying! You don't even have the control key to be able to stay. - We are in a mess. - Pasha, give me a gun. There're no guns. - What do you mean? - They stole them, bastards. - Give us the key. - Not allowed. - We're hungry. - Not allowed. And what are we allowed? Nothing. You're prisoners now. Oh, so we're prisoners! You'll stay in charge now. We'll contact you every hour, two or three. Be very careful. My son, Agapit, will be your guide. He'll try to help you find your comrades. But protect him from the crafty call of the robots. Don't forget, he'll be helpless if he hears it. Goodbye. Soon you will see our native planet. It is a great fortune, for which you may pay with your life. But we must do everything we can for the people from the planet Earth who came here to help us. I hope you can carry out your daring plan. Goodbye. Goodbye. We'll be waiting for you. We're left alone, you and I. You don't seem to be happy about it. I'm not happy about something else. They all flew off except me. And me. Someone had to remain on the ship. I would have been more useful than the others there. Why didn't Vitya take me? Are you asking yourself or me? You. You possess a unique memory, you're perfect in dealing with technology. But when it comes to people, you... Come on, say it. You become insensitive. In situations that outer space offers us, Katyusha, I doubt that one can rely on emotions. You don't have to choose, you don't know anything about feelings. - You read Tolstoy's ''Resurrection''? - Yes. 25th edition, page 43, second paragraph. Read it. When Katyusha came into the room, or even when Nekhlyudov saw her white apron from afar, everything brightened up for him as though lit by the sun... Well, Professor Kuteishchukova, why are you not studying your mysterious planet? Got nothing to say? Then I'll explain it to you. The dragonfly creatures are divided into three types: wormlike dragonflies, anthropoid dragonflies and dragonfly-like dragonflies. We ran across the typical representatives of the anthropoid dragonfly creature. But you don't know how to fight them. They're invincible. Varya, what are you up to? May I ask a few questions? - Not allowed. - Ask them. How much is 9 x 7? lt's elementary. 63. The square of the hypotenuse? The square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the catheti. They know everything. One more question. A and B sat on a tree. A fell down, B disappeared. What remained on the tree? Oh, Jesus! Burned out. Pasha, take the key from them, quick. And let's run. Dead. Burned out. I was wrong. They're not dragonfly creatures. They are robots. Yes, they are robots. What, Pasha? They got no key. Dead, too. And no communication with ship. Agapit, we're in a hurry. Agapit, we're in a hurry. They've been here. I've been here. Lob. Fedka. They were trying to make contact. Agapit, what's this pillar? It's a lift pillar. The means of moving over the planet. Astride? Sorry, l was kidding. Can we get to them? Yes. But where are they? Think, Agapit. - Here they are. - You're alive! Vitya! Vitya dear! Let's get out of here. - Who is he? - Agapit. - You've done them in. - It was Varya. The executor robots are invincible. The live from the planet Earth, we're happy to greet all of you. Now you'll be sent to the making-happy station, and in two hours of Earth time you'll be absolutely happy, happy, happy. These are the controller robots. Commander, we must hurry. Come on, Kuteishchikova, Lobanov, Kozelkov. - This way? - No, that way. Wait, this is the call of the robots. Agapit, stop. This is the call of the robots. It will be your end. Don't stop me. I must go. They call me. We have to split! Is he nuts or what? That's what I call strong! He's disappeared. We must rescue Agapit. If only I knew how. Follow him and you will be happy. The executors will show you the way. Follow them. We'll make you happy. Will make you happy. Will make you happy. This way, there's nobody here. Come back, and you'll be happy. Will be happy. Come back, and you will be... - Good work! - Way to go! We must find out how the robots operate and how to fight them. - We can't do it without Agapit. - Where did they hide him? We must find Agapit, or we'll never get out of here. - Let's disguise ourselves as robots. - How? We have a weapon - A and B. - It won't help. - It will. Where're you going? Let him try. Only be quick. It's not my head. The mechanic mixed them up again. No, it's not mine. This is mine. And this is mine. - Shall we swap? - Let's swap. It's taut. Taut? Then it's mine for sure. I'm asking a question. Just a minute. Ask it. A and B sat on a tree. A fell down, B disappeared. What remained on the tree? What are you doing? You can strangle me. Be patient. - Well? - Real robots. Take a look at yourself. What a picture! - Keep it, you may need it. - Thanks. - Well, shall we go? - Yes. If we're not back in 30 minutes, make your way to the capsule. If there's any danger, get back to the ship. We'll wait for you. This is my order. - Pasha, that's their charger. - Right. Where do they get energy from? Why are you so slow? C'mon, get charged. Yesterday, the 376th was late - and that's it. Shut him down. You nerd. The yellow one only on Mondays. If somebody sees, you'll be in a lot of trouble. The blue! Don't touch the blue one, or you'll burn. I don't seem to like you, guys. Looks like something's wrong with the memory block. - Just kidding. - Kidding. What have you done with the live one? Waiting to get happy on 507th floor. The key's code is black-and-white. Why don't they sound the third ring? I'm starving. Now to the lift pillar. Wow, it feels good! Ah, it feels good. Oh, it feels so good! Oh, it feels so good! Oh, it feels so good! Seventy-one parsecs, and no dragonfly creatures. Agapit is absolutely like a human. He got arms, legs and a head. Will the guys find him or not? What do you think, girls? Sleeping. Of course, they haven't slept for 28 hours. I'm a man, and even I... Feel like sleeping. Girls. What about following this smoke? It will lead us to where those villains are hiding Agapit. Let's pretend that this music of theirs has affected us. Why not, girls? Not a bad idea, huh? Will Vitya guess it? No, he won't. What shall we do? They're sleeping. Sleeping. - Hi. - Hi. What? - Where're you going? - You've scared me, the devils. Where're the girls? They're sleeping there. What about you? The executors are not allowed there if the controllers are present. - What do we do? - We're thinking about that, too. Get Agapit out, we'll wait here. The way you got me out during the exam, just to get a crib. Got you. I'm off. We're glad to see you. Take a seat where you like. Soon you'll be absolutely happy. I came for you. Have you forgotten why you descended on the planet of your ancestors? Oh, it's you. Good. Your nerves are no good if this music affects you so much. I can't do anything with myself. - Now we'll get up and go out. - What for? You idiot, people are going to die because of you. We'll get up now and go out. How? It's impossible. Possible. Just keep mum and do as l do. Get up. Oh, I've got cramps! Oh, I've got cramps! Not allowed, only the happy ones go out of here. You're forgetting that we're alive, and we need to. A defect of the construction? Wrong food. Go. Executors, show them out. Where do the robots get energy? From a charger station at the ocean coast. - How shall we find the station? - I'll show you. All right, this way. Now, let's get the girls, and up there, to the capsule. - And in it, to the charger station. - Careful. Are they alive? Yes, alive, just sleeping. Move over. - What do you mean? - We can't abandon the girls. What about Agapit? The charger station? We can't rescue the girls now, they're sleeping. I'll stay. They'll wake up and we'll try to run away. We got only 90 minutes. Switch the thought detector to the outer connection. - Agapit, to the capsule. - Our only hope is the capsule. And our A and B. We have to find the lift pillar. It must be somewhere here. There it is. Take off the costumes, the masquerade is over. Activating the liquidation of a disposition to compassion, a bent for being conscientious, appendicitis, a feeling of dissatisfaction with oneself, a disposition to kindness, a disposition to love, a disposition to work, a disposition to daring. Why are you standing here? We can't get out, something's holding us. Where's the second one? He needs to be there for a while. An individual defect of the design? Obviously. Take your seat. Varya, give them our A and B. - May l ask you a question? - Ask it. A and B sat on a tree. A fell down, B disappeared. What remained on the tree? Your letter that stands for 'and' remained. In 30 minutes Earth time, you will no longer care about any questions. Look straight ahead. Agapit, we've never been here. Where's our capsule? This is the ocean. But it's a different place. Apparently, I mixed up the combination of plates. I was still under the spell of the call of the robots. What do we do? The lullaby. My mother used to sing it. - What are you doing? - I'm the nurse robot. I've got an outdated design. The caring block has not been removed. And I've been rocking this cradle for 200 years. Only two of us defective are left, the 739th and me. I saw such a machine on pictures. It is supposed to move. I've been waiting for you for 200 years. I'm the mechanic robot! The machine is in full order! Push the button! Get in. - Hurry, Agapit. - Don't interfere. The color gamut of the charger station consists of three combinations. Up from the bottom - yellow, green, blue, red. Yellow, green. The machine will deliver you to your destination. Why doesn't it move? Movement is the white plate. Help me close it. Vitya, we blew it. A and B isn't working on the controllers. The girls are being prepared for making them happy. I'll be the next. If you don't help, it's the end of us. You helped the live ones. You'll be dismantled. Robots - biological, biochemical, mechanical. Robots - silicic, electrostatic. No, it's not that. The way of destruction - energy blockade. That's it. Varya, I'm scared. I'm scared. Won't the boys be able to save us? Danger of first degree. The live ones are threatening. Everything that can burn, must be burned. There is the charger station! Where are you? Misha, I got two minutes. We're in extreme danger. Communication with the ship is blocked. The only possible contact is through the controllers' ball. The fight with these robots was described by Bodyagin. You've read it. You have to remember the page on which it was written. Misha, you're thinking too long. By the system of long-distance communication, the commodore ordered all the working robots to remove their earphones. Carrying out the command, they removed the earphones and, no longer hearing the orders, had quitted the awful game. ''Aha,'' cried the commodore, ''now we'll get to the principal ones...'' Fedya, watch out! So you're stuck? Girls, three have already stuck! You damned dragonflies, we'll get you all! Where are you dragging me? Commander, come here! Here's the entrance to the charger station. Hold on. We're in a trap. I don't know the password. They'll destroy us! Down! - Let's run. - Get down! That's some mirror! Come here! Vitya, we put our hopes only on you. I've glued up three controllers, but it's useless. If you don't help, we're goners. In a few minutes the girls will die. Hurry up, Vitya. Varya, think of something else! All executors report immediately to 1001st floor of the charger station. Destroy the live ones. Everybody entered here only in spacesuits. One can stay here only for a little while. Everything's so simple and elementary. And incomprehensible. We need a signal for recharging. - Are these the inscriptions? - Yes. Outer complex. lnner complex. Hurry, Agapit. - Industrial complex. - No, not that. Transportation. Field of force, amplification, reduction. Signal of recharging. Energy of executors. Energy of controllers. The key code - yellow-green-blue. Doesn't it remind you of a nuclear reactor? Pulling the rod out increases the energy. Yes, it does remind me! We'll disable all of them to bloody hell! Charging for 2 minutes, then the energy cuts off automatically. The protective blocking prevents the robots from burning out. How to switch it off? I don't know. How? How? The key couldn't stand it, it evaporated. lf only we could... We need a metal rod, a steel one! A nail! Come on! Run! You're saved. All but us burned out. They were preparing us for shutting down and temporarily replaced the charging block with a battery. We're defective. We're your friends. You're home now. We're happy for you. Protect your planet. We won't be as carefree as our ancestors had been. And the robots will be our good helpers, right? Your hair began to grow, you're a big boy now. We are your friends. Lay off, l've heard it already. - We are your friends. - I got you. Got you. - We are defective. - Tell it somebody else. - We are to be preserved. - I got a headache from you. We are defective. Will you ever leave me alone?! Thanks. Who wrote this? Well, suppose... 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 13. You're making progress, dear Yekaterina Sergeyevna. - How did you get here? - The call of duty. - How did you survive? - The call of duty. - What did you fly in? - The call of duty. Is it really you? By the call of duty, it's me. Top secret Isn't it time to get back to the Earth, friends? Right, isn't it time to go back to the Earth? The End
