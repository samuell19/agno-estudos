JUPITER FILM presents a JUPITER FILM and GORAE FILM production Of course I know you work hard. SUN Woojung is all about guts. But Woojung, what's wrong is wrong. Why take the hard way when you have a choice. It's not like you're one of a kind. There're two kinds of people with two kinds of reactions. Go or stop. Which kind are you? Of course I'm a 'stop'. It's not like I have a good backer I know I'm not that talented 2017 LITERARY CONTEST It's not spelled out, but isn't this painter, SUN Woojung, your own story? Yes. You're right. I'm attractive. Men kept coming at me. Well, I do have another talent. And by another talent, you mean… Getting bitched at. You know what people call me the most? Bitch. starring YOO DA-IN SIM HEE-SUB SONG JAE-LIM OK JA-YEON and YOU CHEA-MYUNG directed & written by SHIN AGA and LEE SANG-CHEOL THE SNOB People call it plagiarism, but to be clear, it can be called derivative art. From a broader perspective, 'appropriation'? You can see it as applying a new concept to the idea of display and artwork. That is how your pamphlet says but you literally copied an entire work of Charles JANG. It's pirating an idea rather than appropriating it, isn't it? How can it be plagiarism if it's a different artist? I believe my idea to appropriate other works itself is another form of creating art. How do you respond to comments saying your exhibition's 'blah', but it's raising a buzz due to your looks? I'd say, 'Thank you'. But aren't looks a talent as well? Thank you. Thank you. Ms. SUN. How is senior Hyeongjoong doing? He was a senior staff at the university newspaper. I heard you were a couple. I see… I'll let him know you asked about him. Too bad. You must have looked better without the eye job. Excuse me? Nice complexion. Like baby's skin. Hello. You know me, don't you? Yes. PLAGIARISM III She even titled it 'Plagiarism'. How can an artist like you do something like this? Don't waste my time and say what you want. I'll see what I can do. That's not necessary. I just need an apology. I'm sorry I did you wrong. Yes, I'm sorry. That's it? Aren't you admitting you did wrong? I don't think I did anything wrong. By the way, I heard that the price of your paintings have tripled. You should be thanking me for that. Hey. I'll do whatever it takes to kick you out of this scene. Ms. SUN, are you okay? Hey! Ms. SUN please calm down. REQUIRE 4 WKS OF HOSPITALIZATION. I HOPE YOU ARE PREPARED. What a fraud. Ms. SUN. Long time no see. You remember me? We met two years ago at the Biennale after party. Did we? I drank too much that day. YUMIN ART GALLERY CHIEF CURATOR, SEO JINHO Well, have you thought about my offer? I did think hard, but I think it'll be difficult. My private exhibition is going on and I don't have time for new works. But, why did you choose to contact me? Yumin rarely casts pop artists like me. We contacted you because we felt you have enough merits among your peers. If you work with us, we will support you $20,000 after taxes. And we'll also take care of installation costs. A new partnership with us will open doors for more collaboration. Oh, I liked the exhibition you opened last year. The one with foreign workers standing nude in masks. I'm avoiding political and socials issues for now. It feels hypocritical to pretend to know when you don't. The true hypocrites are out there. Of course if you watch the news, you'd know. This job often makes me feel self-deprecation too. It's the first time I've met a male curator. Was your dream always a curator? At first, I wanted to be an artist, but I came to realize that you have to be gifted with talents. It was around then I got married. So you're married? Do you have a boyfriend, Ms. SUN? Is he in the art field? Kind of I knew it. It's good to meet someone in your field. Ms. SUN. Ms. SUN! I forgot to tell you. But it's not something to discuss in the street. How about that place? You mean the hotel? The wine bar there has a great view I want to show it to you, Ms. SUN. Are you suggesting we have a one-night-stand? A one-night-stand? I guess that'll work too. But there's no pressure. You're home. Yeah. What about dinner? Yeah. YOU DIDN'T KNOW? YUMIN GALLERY GOT QUESTIONED FOR LOBBYING. LOG OUT Have you decided to do the Yumin special exhibition? Hey, I haven't made a decision yet. Where did you hear that? I'm a journalist you know? Good. Jihyeon's the Art Director there. You know YOO Jihyeon? Of course! He would have been my uncle. I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow in Jeongdong. What for? Dunno, guess he's got something to say. Wanna come? It's good to get acquainted. ARTIST YOO JIHYEON INTERVIEW You know YOON Seonye? The girl with close-set eyes and gloomy vibes. Seonye? Who's that? She called you senior. She was a younger member of your university newspaper. I guess there was a girl like her. I'm not so sure about her I bet she's done an eyelid surgery, but she wouldn't admit it. You've got one message from SEO Jinho Can we meet today? I, don't, think, so. Your message has been sent You've got a totally different look from what I'm used to I never had a crush on you. During our 3rd round you clearly said that I have a good looking. I have no recollection whatsoever. You keep arguing though. I'm not arguing, I'm just a little hurt I even cancelled my early morning flight the next day. Sorry. Yes, Mr. YOO. I'm out of the office. Now's difficult I'm busy at the moment. You can tell me on the phone. Hello? Hello? Woojung, this is Jinyoung. Has Soyoung called you? What? Who? Soyoung returned to Korea last week, and she's not well. She hasn't been in touch since she went out yesterday. I think she'll probably contact you. If she does, call me. Not well, my ass… Do something to stop her, Woojung. She's driving me crazy. This is nice. Hey, I got married, but had an affair. My English in-laws are out of their minds. They just sent me to a mental institution I had to stay there for 3 months. Don't believe what she says, she's such a liar. I'm telling the truth See this? These are shots they gave me. When I refused to take pills, the bastards gave me shots. Hey. Whatcha lookin at? Huh? Why are you looking at me like that? You've seen me before? You know me? What did you just think? What were you thinking when you looked at me, asshole?! How dare you touch me, you son of a bitch! You're a fucking loser, you son of a bitch! HYEONG Stop it! Okay, I'll be there soon. If I take a cab, I'll make it. Yeah, okay. Are you alone? Where's your girlfriend? She's running late. What would you like to eat? There's a great seaweed soup place around here. Let's go! Hyeongjoong. Would you like to work as our special exhibition curator? It's a 3-month job. If you say okay, 'll talk to your editor. Don't you already have a curator in charge? They hired him when I wasn't around. He's not so great to work with I came here right after firing him. I'm not sure about this I don't have the right credentials. But you've curated before! It was just a part-time job for a few months. Awe, come on… Yeah, Ms. KIM. Awe, let a man eat, for Christ's sake… Okay, fine I'm on my way. Uh, yeah. Oh, and in March, there'll be a retrospective of my work in Berlin. If you write a 10-page article, the trip's free. Let's go have some fun. Yeah, well… Have more Here, eat more. This is the real deal. Awe, I have to go. Finish up. No need to come. He left for another appointment. Just come home. I thought your meeting was at 8. It's been less than an hour. I'm running out of batteries. Later. He's doing it again. SUN! Wait for me! SUN! Stop hanging up first. Why do you keep doing it when I hate it so? You should've brought your friend. I'd like to meet her, too. You are not listening, again. JINYOUNG Yeah, Jinyoung. Hey, SUN! I'm heading for your place right now. Where is it? Wait downstairs with cab fare, okay? Awe, jeez… Nice place. Which floor? Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What do you want? Let me stay until Dan's here. You know him, right? My husband Dan. He's on the plane from England right now. Hey. This isn't my place. I can't do as I please. Who is it? Who told our SUN to kick me out? Which bitch told you to?! Hey! Huh? What the fuck? What's he glaring at? It's not like he owns the entire lot! How could deny a friend you've met in 10 years a night over…? I'm so hurt. Wow… Bad news. I like him. What's your name? It's KIM Hyeongjoong. KIM-Hyeong-joong. What does it stand for? Successful and precious. Hyeongjoong. Can I stay here for a few days? Hey, you can't. This isn't a place for you to stay. Okay. I'm busy for the time being and she leaves for her studio. What? Hey. Settle things among yourselves. I'm turning in. Hey, Hyeong. KIM Hyeongjoong! What? Nice place. Hey! Hey, SUN! Do you sleep in separate bedrooms? Are you a 'no sex' couple? How come you live together but not sleep together? You guys are weird. YUMIN ART GALLERY 20TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EXHIBITION YUMIN ART GALLERY Of course I trust you I can settle for an indictment without detention. Okay. I trust you. Okay. Did you meet that junior schoolmate of yours? He'll give me an answer tomorrow. And did you tell SEO? I laid it all out for him, so I guess he got it. Just make sure everything to be clear. My head's about to explode. You could have lied back and enjoyed the art. Why did you have to jump into all of this, and go through troubles? Stop nagging. You're going home, right? I have meetings starting early in the morning. So? Stop acting so busy. Just drop me off, okay? Just don't stop me. Fresh air, huh? THE EXHIBITION HALL ON 2ND FLOOR Let's go. Attention please. I know you may have heard, but I was hired at the last moment for this exhibition. Since we're short of time to get in sync, I took it upon myself to bring in a new team manager, KIM Hyeongjoong. Please welcome him. I'm KIM Hyeongjoong. I'm sorry everything has been happening so fast. I'm sure the company will compensate you adequately. So, I hope you will extend a helping hand to him… How long does he need to empty his desk?! This all must be confusing, but consider it a fresh new start and get to work. Okay? Mr. YOO. When will you resolve our team's overdue wage issue? This isn't the place to discuss internal issues. Since I've joined the team, it'll be resolved in no time. It's been 2 months since we've been told the same story. Until our team's paycheck comes in, I'm keeping this seat. If you need one, use this. Mr. SEO. Let's talk. We can do it right here. Let's go outside. It won't take long. I think we all need to listen to what you have to say. Stop being so stubborn! Let's go outside. No. Since I'm already here, I'll just get to work. You said I should use this seat, right? Listening to him, it seems Mr. JANG isn't asking for much. What did you say he wants? If you can just make an official apology, he said he'll call off the lawsuit. For God's sake, what did I ever do wrong? He received a 4 wk diagnosis. Ms. SUN must be working out a lot. What a shove that was. He started it first. Ms. SUN. But you did wrong, didn't you? Yes. I'm sorry. Okay, great. Since we agree it was a misunderstanding… - let's put it aside and… - No, not that. You should admit you plagiarized. I said it's not plagiarism, but appropriation in art. There you go again. You're not making any progress. If you can give in just a bit, we can all live in peace. Sir, you know why Andy Warhol was called an artist? Cause he blatantly copied the image of a canned product and confidently claimed he did. That's what you call 'art'. Get your facts right before you make claims. Woojung. Soyoung took my mobile yesterday and I can't reach her. Soyoung's still at my place after she barged in last night. Good. Can you keep her with you so she won't get into trouble? I'm a bit busy. I'm sorry I have to prepare for an exhibition I was suddenly assigned to go on this trip. Then, you can always send her to a motel or hotel. Yeah, okay Thank you! Hello? Yo, friend. How was the meeting? What's that? Wanna a puff for old time's sake? I can always call the cops. You want me to tell them we were pot smoking buddies? This is Hyeongjoong's house. If you need to smoke pot, do it at your own place I don't have a place to go. Then go to your mom's. She passed away 3 years ago, you bitch. And you call yourself a friend? It happens when there's no mail from a 'friend'. Who sends word like that through the mail? My mom was sick anyway. Oh, your card also comes out as a sun. It says you'll win the lawsuit. Congrats. Let's get something good to eat. I've been starving all day. Make me something to eat. I thought you said you were settling down in the UK? You haven't changed, have you? If you had an affair, you shouldn't have been caught. Who says I was caught I told him all. Hey Dan has an insanely good heart. He told me to confess if I cheat on him, so I did. But the fucker just had to tell his mom and his sister. I did all kinds of drugs, but nothing beats the ones at the mental hospital in the UK. It literally makes you a half-wit. So, you're saying you got those marks from the hospital? Who is it? You should introduce him to me. Fuck you! Never get caught by your boyfriend. He's just like Dan. He'll be vicious if he finds out. What? Dicks and cunts are always the problem. If your cunt wants it, how can your head deny it? SUN Go have an affair. Do it, but make sure it's a perfect crime. Okay? Hyeongjoong, what do you like about her? She isn't the timeless beauty type. She reminds me of my mother. My ideal type is someone like my mother. Oh. Yeah, she cooks well, and has an older look. Are you classmates from university? Is that what she said? We're high school buddies. We painted at the same atelier in Bongdong near Jeonju... Hey! Try this one. Hey, SUN. Did you tell him that story? What now. Not yet? Hurry and tell him. What's the delay? What story? Don't trust her She's full of lies. Hyeongjoong. Did you know she's seeing someone else? What? Did I say something wrong? Sorry. I'll shut up. TAK Soyoung. Stop talking about others and just talk about yourself. Why did you return to Korea? You vowed never to come back and spat on the airport. Are you seeing someone else? I told you she's nutty. Stop responding to her. Nuttier than you? Great. Then I'll just have a little affair myself. Yeah! Why didn't I think of that? SUN Just like I told you, right? Having fun pissing me off? Don't you get it? I only have 2 months until the exhibition. Can't you see you're going to mess it all up? Two months is enough. Want me to paint for you? Hey! Like you mentioned, he's got a knife up his sleeve. If he finds out, he'll kick me out, and write a negative article on me for sure. And it'll be the end of my career. Do you really want things to come to that? Remember BAHN Jaeyoung? The dude with the pierced tongue. What? IM Moonyoung, KIM Sangjae, LEE Dukcheong. They all dated you until they fell for me. Are you trying to brag about being popular? Men have always been more into me than you. They still are. - Crazy bitch! - So, I'll seduce your boyfriend. Go have your affair without having to worry. What? It'll be your insurance. I'll seduce KIM Hyeongjoong and have sex with him. The British say you can dodge horse shit but not bird shit. Why would you have sex with my boyfriend? Are you nuts? You'll need an excuse in case you get caught. And call it even. Then he can't write anything negative about you. I wondered why I was drawn to this place. I guess it was to help our little SUN. Just trust me. I'm a pro in seducing men. BALANCE DUE $ 2,000 I made two demands to the gallery Director, Ms. KIM. Pay 100% of our overdue wages and reinstate my position. If there's no reply by this week, we're starting a boycott. Well, there's no pressure to join or not. Just let me know your answer by this weekend. Yes, Jihyeon. Yes. I'm on it, but do we really have to go this far? I feel like a spy. Come on… It's cause I heard a rumor that they created this members-only chat room, to collect any irregularities on the gallery's management to use in their favor if necessary. We need to be prepared just in case I trust you'll do a good job. Okay. SUN WOOJUNG PRIVATE EXHIBITION ADDITION TO THE YUMIN SPECIAL EXHIBITION, COMING SOON! - HELLO. - HELLO TO YOU TOO. - THE WEATHER IS NICE. - YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE, SEO! - GOOD NITE. - YES, GOOD NITE. Is he married? Why'd you have to pick a married one? Funny to hear this from someone who fled because of an affair I didn't flee from anything. Are you into Hyeongjoong? I'm into every man on the planet. He's not your type. Don't even think of it. So you think you know my type, huh? You won't be satisfied. Tiny dick? Forget it. He likes when you give him head. Doing it with your mouth. A blowjob! OK, what else. Get the evidence. Recording a video would be the best. What for? So he can't lie. If you're gonna do it, do it right. So, it's a green light? Even you fail, I know nothing about this. All rise! Please be seated! SUN Woojung's art stands at the frontline of postmodernism. If she loses, the controversy over derivative art, and artists' freedom of expression will be subject to… subject to legal intervention. Plagiarism in the art scene has been an ongoing debate. Recently, it has become an issue of the artist's moral standing. In the case of the defendant, it can be seen as appropriating an image. But without accepting the original artist's plea for an apology, the defendant has taken forceful actions toward the plaintiff, the court rules, the defendant to pay $30,000 to the plaintiff as compensation. Admit it now, that you plagiarized. I just wanted you to say that you copied my work. This just makes me look like I won by getting beat up. Mr. JANG. If you keep this up, it'll look like you're into me. So fuck off before I kick you in the groin. Are you here? Right, just walk straight into the alley. Okay, I'm on my way. Okay, I'll see you at the studio. Ah, Ms. SUN. I just wanted to check what's been sold. We did make a sell, but… Just tell me. You're hesitation is scaring me more. Not that way, but this way. The clients who bought your work cancelled I guess they heard about the trial. It's okay. I've decided to do the Yumin Special Exhibition. Oh, really? I'm glad. I'll be back after I take care of this. If you're all done, let's call it a day. Still have a lot of work to do? No, not really. Then, I'll be leaving. Good bye! CAN YOU FIND ALL LOCATIONS A CAR PASSED THROUGH WITH A GPS CHIP? You're early. Woojung had to leave for the trial. She asked me to get you dinner. Did you have dinner? No, not yet. I'll do the cooking. What would you like? You seem tired these days. You've got bags under your eyes. How clear your eyes are. I had LASIK done. They did a good job. Care for a drink? Please sit. I've got work to do. So won't put out, huh? Why are you so late? Sorry to keep you waiting. Can I ask what your name means? Little, flower petal. Little flower. But I used a different name in the UK. Burny. Burny. It's the name Woojung gave me when I used to be in a band. She said, since she's 'SUN', that I should be 'burn'. I should've prepared myself in case I lost. That way I wouldn't have been too surprised like this. You got a heavy penalty, didn't you? Are you going to appeal? Since you mention it, can you arrange production costs by this month? I got fired from Yumin. What? How come? YOO Jihyeon brought in his own curator. Do you know any art journalists? Why do you ask? I need to expose everything I know. Everything related to Yumin. I'm going to make sure it makes news. It's sink or swim. I know this one art journalist. KIM Hyeongjoong of YOO Jihyeon's new curator is… KIM Hyeongjoong. You have good pronunciation. How can I speak good English? You need to meet someone who speaks good English. Like me. Soyoung, do you have feelings for me? I have to see to be sure. What's this? I asked you a question. I know my rights. I have the right to be silent. So believe what you want. I had no idea, trust me. I had no idea he met with YOO Jihyeon because of that. Ms. SUN. Can you give me Hyeongjoong's social security no. and ID? What for? I need to find dirt on those on the upper level. With his personal details. I love you. Is this a bit sudden? So out of context. To keep silent to injustice is another form of injustice. If young people like us don't change, you know well this field is doomed. Let's make a change. SUN, it's me! Are you there? You're in there, aren't you? - Who's she? - SUN! Shit, what are we going to do now? I failed to seduce KIM Hyeongjoong. What? I guess we're too old for this. I guess we're too old for this. It's not working anymore. Since I kept my mouth shut, I'll crash here for a while. I barely made it out. That's why I'm in your clothes. Got anything to drink? Hey, sit. Huh? I said, sit! Hey, TAK! Oh. You look familiar. Ah, the smiley face! Sorry. Sorry for the intrusion. Excuse me. There's a nice vibe in your eyes. What's your name? Let's go, we'll talk outside. Don't even think of drinking! Your friend seems free spirited. Is she also in the arts? Wanna grab a drink somewhere? No, let's just call it a night. You're late. Were you drinking? Everyone is talking about the trial. I guess everyone's gloating over my misery. Not you, but Mr. JANG's win was the main subject. I heard you're working at Yumin. So you're not sharing work with me anymore? I just started. You've been busy with the trial lately, haven't you? Who did you hear it from? Can you arrange a meeting with YOO Jihyeon? I need to copy YOO Jihyeon's work for this exhibition. But you never liked his work. Beggars can't be choosers I have to pay $30,000 for compensation. I need to sell something. How about telling Soyoung to leave? Why? You told her to stay. I keep seeing her as a woman. I see you're a man after all. Okay, I'll tell her to leave. Is there anything you want to tell me? No. Like what? You must have something to say, right? I don't either. Ah… There is one thing. But it all depends on you. I knew it! Good, it's enough to shut them up. See? Didn't I say you've got talent in this area? I don't think I could do it once more. Don't ask me again. Good job. Have more. It's dropping… Have more. Yeah. Okay. We'll take her to the family gravesite. Okay. She should have treated him better when he was alive. Is it your wife? Yeah. You seem to get along with your wife. Not really. You'll see when you reach my age. What we have is friendship. Friendship. Right. I heard you were working here. You know Ms. YOON? Of course. He kept nagging me in university for being a bad writer. Since you're eating, should I come back? No, no, I'm done. Take your time and finish it. Let's go. Call me. Too cheap to buy a new plate? Why is he always giving me leftovers? Friendship, my ass. TRANSFER OF DUTIES CHIEF CURATOR THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY Mr. SEO. Did you clear out this computer? I can't find any files on it. Well, I have no idea. Yes, hello? Ah, yes. Yes, we're on it. Yes, I have a question. Can you restore the data on a GPS chip? About a month. I'm SUN Woojung. Yes, nice to meet you I heard a lot about you. Have a seat. Here. Thank you. You're truly a beauty as I've heard. I've only got 30 mins until another appointment. Shall we then get to the point? I wanted to tell you in person. I've always been a big fan of yours. Especially your C series. Hair? You like hair? How nice, how nice and all, but I guess you're not the normal kind. Ah, sorry, sorry about that. So? May I appropriate your series for the exhibition? I wanted to ask for your permission. Okay, you can do that. Thank you. But Ms. SUN, how old are you now? Oh, oh. Which university did you go to? Ewha Univ., majored in Western Painting. Ah. Your attitude was from your powerful alumni. Right? It's all okay but if you'd let me be a bit condescending, for veterans like you and me, who's been this scene for years should know better, right? You could label it as appropriation, but you're just deluding yourself, and using this as an excuse. Well. I'm not really sure what you mean. Yeah, you can take from my work, no big deal, but isn't it hard to live like this? Are you a psycho? After all you've been through, shouldn't you seek another path? You're not someone who can create art. I am saying this from the bottom of my heart. Yes. You're right. That didn't take long? What did he say? I'm laying low for the time being, so don't try to reach me. Hello. Ms. SUN! Hello I just couldn't reach you. When can I get your draft? Mr. SEO. You know Ms. SUN, don't you? It's been a while. I was going to contact you for the draft. I had an appointment here. For this exhibition, we'd like to use Ms. SUN's work as our pitching point. What do you think? With something that hasn't even been made? If that's what you wish. You're quite talkative today. How could you kick them out like that? They're good kids. Eat while you're at it. Didn't I tell you? You're way far from artist. Every Tom, Dick, Harry says they are artist. Yeah, Jinyoung. So when are you coming? It's been days since you said you'd come. Why are you doing this to me?! It's been days since I said take her with you! Why did you come to me? Haven't I told you 10 years ago, I never wanted to see you again?! Back then, you said the same thing, that I should quit art. You think you're the only one who has a mouth? I can say it too, you know? That you're a crazy junkie bitch! Okay? You might be able to quit as you wish, but not me. This is all I've got with nowhere to go if I quit. It's a do or die situation for me, you know? So try to be a bit more civil, will you? I had no idea you've been holding so much against me. Okay. I'll fuck off. Have a good life. ART IS DEAD Mr. SEO. What about Ms. SUN? You haven't talked to her yet, have you? No, why? I did okay her as a guest artist, but with the trial results, it won't be good to work with her. It'll just cause a negative buzz. How about we just not mention our project to her? At least we should talk to her. If she finds out later, we'll look really bad. She wouldn't side with us, would she? I don't know. I'm curious myself. Where are you going? It's none of your business. It's unlikely we'll be seeing each other again, so, how about a drink? Soyoung. You said you were childhood friends with Woojung, right? What was she like? She's no friend of mine. Ask her yourself I don't want to waste my time. She never talks about herself. You're the first friend of hers I've met. She was a cheap rubber shoe to me. What's that? Even shoes have class. My favorite kind is Jimmy Choo. Next is Louboutin. And the next is Valentino. There's about 10 different classes. Where do you think a cheap rubber shoe ranks? I don't know. I'm not familiar with women's shoes. You don't need to know to answer that. No designer shoe shelf would carry cheap rubber shoes. There are 2 kinds of 'have nots' like her. Those who ask for more, and those who are too proud to take anything. She was none of these kinds. She's too proud, but still takes what's offered. Woojung's living here for free, isn't she. She did the same thing 10 years ago. After her family went broke, she came to stay for 3 days, which turned into 3 years. Using my makeup, wearing my clothes. Sometimes I'd be confused if I'm her or she's me. Be careful. She pretends she's your maid and then leeches off you. She can stab you in the back with a smile on her face. Don't say I never warned you. By the way, Soyoung! Why are you suddenly acting like a friend? So, am I pissing you off? I'm sorry. Enough? Why were you secretly taping us? You planned this with someone, didn't you? What a load of bullshit. How many times do I have to tell you, it was just me! In case she's caught cheating, she needed insurance… Awe, fuck… Why did you do it? Were you two playing me? -Mr. SEO -Ms. SUN. You first. No, you go first. I'll hear you out first. In case me and Hyeongjoong were drowning, who would you save first? Who would you save? Me or your wife? I am going to turn the Yumin Gallery inside out. Boycott the exhibition, and present an anti-Yumin performance with young artists. If both were drowning, I will save you, Ms. SUN. How about you? Is it me or KIM Hyeongjoong? Thank you. Take a look. You could've just told me, why did you have to show it to me? What for? What do you want me to do? Did you tell Soyoung to seduce me? Is that what she said? Actually seeing it is like a slap in the face. Like a bad soap opera. Okay, let's call it quits. What's more to say? It was nice knowing you for 3 years. I'll just pack my bags and leave. But I'll have to use the studio for now. Give me 2 months tops. DELETE VIDEO I no longer care who you're seeing or what secrets you have. Let's just wipe the slate clean. I realized as I was getting it on with Soyoung, that you're the only one for me. Just trust me. I'll take care of everything. Yes, I do understand. We'll have to accept it. Okay. This is your work Ms. TAK, isn't it? So. So what? I went to this exhibition, too. When Dan said it was by his wife, I assumed you to be British. Turns out you're Korean and Ms. SUN's friend… What a small world. Friend my ass. That's over. Why bring that up? That was 5 years ago. I'm no artist. I'm planning an exhibition that's quite unconventional. I'd like you to participate, Ms. TAK. You want me to paint? What for? Tell SUN Woojung to do it. It's been ages since I quit. I'm going to ask Ms. SUN as well. Both of you need to participate for it to be a complete project. I'm working I'll call you later. I'm in front of your studio. This won't take long. It's quite chilly outside, isn't it? You'll be shocked to know whom I just met. I'm going to get on the side of KIM Hyeongjoong and YOO Jihyeon. About the few encounters we had, I'd like you to forget it even happened. Why so suddenly? Did something happen? You said it yourself. That it'll help my career to align with Yumin. I'm sick of fighting this hard to create art. At the end they'll cut you out You okay with that? They'll be merciless when they no longer need you. Or maybe not? Will KIM Hyeongjoong keep that from happening? I'll keep the offer open. If anything happens there, you're always welcome here. What could happen to me?! Listen carefully. I only slept with you because you were the Chief Curator at Yumin. If it wasn't for that, you'd be nothing to me. Without that, you're nothing. Just dickless. I'd rather die than go there, so don't call me again 1 month later. YUMIN ART GALLERY 20TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EXHIBITION Wow, nice. Interesting. Yes, it is. Ah. Hey, Ms. SUN. Your work this time is great. It was worth all the trouble. Why focus on appropriation in art when you can be this good? You won't appropriate work anymore, will you? For the last time, I'd like to do yours. You already gave me the permission, right? You're quite persistent, aren't you? I like that. Let's go. Ms. SUN! Congratulations. I love your work. Thank you. Good to see you again. Why are you here together? Flirting with each other? Ow, Ms. SUN, you're hurting me… Hyeongjoong asked me to come. Hyeongjoong? Since when did you drop the 'senior'? She's writing the daily coverage of our exhibition. Jihyeon asked her to work for us. Is that so? Sorry for the misunderstanding. I almost got mad thinking she was trying to seduce you. You've got a really strong grip, Ms. SUN I almost died of pain. I know, I was getting all pumped up. CONDOLENCES ART IS DEAD Our Young Artists Coalition of 20, in light of managing the gallery to increase corporate secret funds, and delaying payment of staff wages we denounce Yumin Art Gallery I did the same thing 10 years ago and they're still doing it. To artists who cater to the powerful, we refuse to overlook your decaying spirit. Self-reflection is something we strongly recommend. Hey, SUN! Why am I here? To congratulate my friend's exhibition I even brought a gift. That's it. That's your gift. Our Young Artists Coalition, cries out to a world filled with fakes, as a warning to the plagiarism culture and shameful artists living off it BY SUN WOOJUNG Title Artist TAK Soyoung. Artist TAK Soyoung invited by the Young Artists Coalition, has completed this piece to send a warning to plagiarism culture. Nice work. TAK Soyoung still has it. I always worked faster than you. You think I'd care? You two over there! Gallery Director Ms. KIM and Mr. YOO Jihyeon. I passed on your corporate credit card statement to the press I think by tomorrow, your phones will be on fire. Thank you for bombing our exhibition, Mr. SEO. Since you're here, I'd like to show you something this time. You met Ms. SUN on this day at the gallery café, didn't you? Where did you both go after you left the café? You went to a bar. Then the Sky Hotel. What did you do at the hotel? Wow, it's out. See? I knew he had a knife up his sleeve. Why don't you explain yourself? Before I play the next video. What are you doing? Are you nuts? What's her deal? Were you behind this too? The guide dog farm in Yongin! The paintings you hid at the foundation school. You bought them all with corporate funds, which are an enormous amount. So, how did I find out? Ms. SUN gave me all of Hyeongjoong's personal details ID, password, social security no., everything. I guess I was really loved by this woman. Where are you going, SUN?! Everyone here, now knows about your affair. You can't just leave like this. Ms. SUN here, was a poor girl when she was in high school her family suddenly went broke, her mother, earned money as a cleaning lady to pay her atelier fees. But then she wanted to go to a prestigious university. We traveled to Seoul together to take the skill test, and we starting drinking during the day, and without any sleep, we went to the test site. Suddenly she asked me, if we could, swap our exam ID slips. At the time, my only wish was to piss off my fucking dad! I refused to satisfy his ego by entering this university. So, I passed with SUN Woojung's exam ID slip, and SUN with my ID, failed. I got her into Ewha Univ. And now she's being treated as an artist. Life can be funny, right? Everything's a lie. She's been using drugs since high school. She returned from the UK a few days ago where she escaped from a mental institution. You see her shot marks? You did it with me when I was taking drugs. You think I wouldn't know you painted that after smoking pot? You're right. But, but this is also a part of my work. You have to sell your soul to be a true artist. If it's for the sake of art. When someone's dying, at first they deny it and get angry. Why is this happening to me. No, it's just a bad dream. It was the same for me. It was painful. All kinds of thoughts went through my mind. But frankly speaking, I'm glad it came down to this I forged my way into a university living in fear for the past 15 years. To think positively, Soyoung helped me. It's like she slapped me when I needed to cry. If so, why did you write this? Isn't it because you wanted to fuck everyone here over? Your story doesn't match up. From a basement room without any heating, where I survived on instant noodles for a month, YOUNG ARTISTS COALITION CALLS OFF BOYCOTT... I clicked on a mega sale coupon by accident and came across that news report. Everyone there that day were in the photo. Young Artists Coalition's SEO Jinho. Appointed Deputy Director of Yumin Art Gallery. WRITTEN BY YOON SEONYE In an interview, Chief Curator KIM Hyeongjoong stated… These clowns were having a fucking ball. It all started with a single hateful comment, but I just couldn't stop. Then I decided. - I should also give him a gift. - I SHOULD ALSO GIVE HIM A GIFT. Why did you ask to see me? It was last year that I failed the literary contest. All artists talk about is money when they get together. All businessmen talk about is art when they get together. When I was young, I tried to imitate Kafka, but… I have a part-time job I need to go to. Can you make it short? I read your script again, Ms. SUN. To be honest, your writing's so so. It's not great, but there's something there. Something good. I want to sign you up. On one condition, that you use their real names. And not change a single thing. This is a fiction. It's not 100% true. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it's 100% true or not, just that it's based on a true story. Who knows? Thanks to this story, maybe you can turn your life around. Woojung bowed low as she apologized to them. As she sashayed out, Woojung recalled their names one by one. Adulterer, SEO Jinho. SUN WOOJUNG'S NOVEL WOOJUNG IS ON FIRE The washed-out YOO Jihyeon. Money launderer, KIM Boryung. Small-time journalist, YOON Seonye. And the pathetic human being, KIM Hyeongjoong. SUN WOOJUNG BOOK SIGNING They had no idea. That Woojung was just hiding her claws for now. As she walked out, Woojung saw the world on fire. It was Sodom and Gomorrah, right before the Tower of Babel collapsed. Your name? I guess you really like me, to write a book about me. I'm leaving for the UK tomorrow. I was packing when I decided to stop by I was going to send this in the mail. EXAM ID SLIP: SUN WOOJUNG Yours.
