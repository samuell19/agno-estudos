Look, look. They're getting it. They'll get you too, you little fool. Phew. That was close. Thanks. A Yank? Brooklyn. - A Yank from Brooklyn. You're the rarest thing in London. I'm meeting friends here. Will you join us? You go ahead, Captain .. - Barry Craig. Please. It isn't every night you run into an air raid and an American. Besides, they're still playing tag up there. Well, alright. A few moments then. Over here. Hi, boys. Barry. Where you been? Gwen here is getting as sore as a boil. Miss ..? - Kendall. Captain Peterson. Pleased to know you, Miss Kendall. This is Gwen. And that is Ivy. I'm Miss Aldridge if you don't mind. And Miss Miles. My error. Won't you sit down? Barry, we're all going to have a drink. A great idea. Waiter. Two more please. - No. None for me. Really? Just one then. I thought we had an engagement. I am sorry. I couldn't get here any sooner. Been over long? It seems years. How are the folks? Isn't that how you Americans refer to your people? Yes. Quaint, isn't it. As you English say. Attaboy. Come on now, everybody. All have a rink right now. Bottoms up. And now, let's dance. Huh? Let's have a good time. I'll try anything once with you, Ivy. Can I order you something? - No. Nothing really. You live here in London? - Yes. I have been. Shall we dance, Barry? Well. I ducked two parties to be with you tonight. Dance. Do. Don't if you'd rather not. Alright. Dance. I'll be back soon. Alright. You're a beast. Barry. To bring her here. Yeah? You're not frightfully chatty, are you. Blooming murderers. The blighters. Cab, lady? - No thanks. Rotten luck. Barry. Barry. Waiter. Where is the young lady? - She left, sir. Thanks. Buy something, Captain? Thank you, Captain. Flush or broke, he'll have his little joke. He can't be suppressed. All the other fellows have to grin when he gets this off his chest. Hang up your troubles in your old kitbag and smile, smile, smile. While you've a lucifer to light your fag. Smile, boys. That's the style. What's the use of worrying? It never was worthwhile. So pack up your troubles in your old kitbag and smile, smile, smile. How are you feeling? - Splendid, sir. Excellent. The PMO tells me you're leaving the hospital today. Congratulations. - Thank you, sir. Anxious to be back in the thick of it again? After four years of it I'd hate not to be in at the finish. Finish? I hope you are right, Sir Wilfred. I hope so too. Sir Wilfred. Lord and Lady Ponsonby have come for you. They're in the waiting room. Thanks. I shall see you before I go? - Of course. James. James. I must ask you either to be firm or to let me do the talking. I'll be as weak as I like. Don't be an ass, James. Wilfred. - How are you, aunt Agatha? Well, glad to be out of here, eh? Hospitals always did give me the hump. I'm used to them now, sir. This will be the last one, Wilfred. Your uncle had luncheon at Downing Street. It has been arranged that you remain at home and carry on here. Here? Not me. A week in the country to get the squeaks out of my body and I'm off. I know how you feel, my boy. But we .. We want you at home. To sit in the War Office with a lot of old fogeys. You have done your bit. You have been wounded five times. If anything happened to you, Wilfred. You are the very last one of us. So I am to be wrapped in cotton wool? Preserved. In order to prolong the family tree, eh? That's very un-English of you, Wilfred. Hello. I just dropped off. - That's because you're still weak. I say. I suppose you are frightfully busy. Yes. Why? - Nothing. I just wish you weren't. That's all. I'll come back if I get a moment. Mr Darrow? - Yes. The fourth cot on the left. - Thank you. Barry. Barry. - Leslie. When did you get in? How long is your leave? It's grand you've looked me up. I'm here for a week. A little present for you. American cigarettes. Sure. - Well, well. You'll go to heaven for this. So you've had a rough time with it? - They didn't think I'd pull through. They wanted to chop this whole left arm off. But see, I still have it. - That's great. I'm going to be out of here in a week. The PMO says so. Maybe I can come back with you, Barry. I hope so. Ah well. So be it. James. The War Office and the old fogeys. Somehow, I don't seem to believe in those old things any longer. That's the war, my boy. When it's over you'll feel differently. It's just those old things that you don't believe in any longer. Traditions. Families. Us. Which make England .. England. Pardon. Sir Wilfred. The PMO would like to see you before you leave. Righto. Do you know Lord and Lady Ponsonby, my uncle and aunt? Aunt Agatha, this is Miss Kendall. - How do you do. You are the American one. My friend, the Duchess, who takes such pride in the hospital has spoken of you. I wish you'd speak to the Duchess about letting Miss Kendall have a week off. They work her like a dog here. Then you can come to visit us. In the country. Chettenham Court. You know. Old England. Castle with a moat and that sort of thing. I'm afraid they could never spare me. - Well. We'll see. Shan't be a minute, uncle James. A nice girl. Well, they've ditched me, Miss Kendall. Ditched you? - Yes. Into the War Office. If I'd known it before you'd never have made me well. That's a shame. I hope you're not going to ditch me too. It's pretty lonely here in London with everybody over there. I don't get much time to myself. Well, think of me. In the musty old War Office all day. Have a heart. As you people say. And dine with me very soon. - I'd love to. You phone me. - Thanks. And. As for what you've done for me here. Well .. I'm not much good at thanking people. Nor I at being thanked. Visiting hour is up. Well, Leslie? - Well. Seeing you is almost like being back at the front myself. I'll drop in again before I push off. - Great. Barry. Thanks for the fags. Pardon me. The Yank from Brooklyn. Well, what are you doing here? Heaven guided my footsteps. Say. Why did you run out on me last night? You seemed to be somewhat entangled with your girlfriend. You spoiled my whole evening. One seventh of my entire leave. - That is why I left. So you could enjoy yourself. Enjoy myself? Know what I did after you left? Visiting hour is up, Miss Kendall. Well, what did you do? Never mind. I'll tell you. - What? I .. I broke into a church and burned a candle to St Anthony. St Anthony? What good did that do you? Good? I had found you. Do we chow together tonight? Tomorrow. Tonight and tomorrow. Tomorrow. Visiting hour is up. Tonight and tomorrow. Don't, Barry. But that's all that's left of a perfect week. You know, Doris. I dreaded this leave. I wondered what I would do with so much time. It's flown. It's still flying. This crazy thing keeps ticking. Don't look at it, Barry. It makes it go faster. You sweet kid. Your change, sir. Thank you, sir. Do you want to dance? Do you? I don't want to share you with people. Let's have a look at the river. Will you have a punt, sir? - Please. You can work one of these things? - I'll try. As long as it doesn't go into a tailspin. I used to go boating on the lake at home. I wish I had known you then. How dull and stupid everything seems. Nothing ever happens. But I'd like it now. Instead of this frantic chasing after time. The last dance. The last meal. The last few moments. Racing. Racing. - Yes. But there's a kick to it. It's exciting. Exciting, yes. It brought us here. Taking you tomorrow. There will never be anyone for me. But you. I love you, Barry. You will marry me then? Tonight if I could. - Tonight. Why can't we? We will. We'll dash to London and get a special licence. You will be my wife. Yours. Forever. We can be there in an hour. Barry. I'm afraid if I marry you now they might send me home. I'd be the wife of an American officer. And they don't let wives stay in the war zone. I would be gone before your next leave. All we'd have would be .. Tonight. But you'd be my wife. Even if they did send you back. The war isn't going to last forever. - I know. Who knows how long it is going to last. It might be years, Barry. Years. I don't want to be just married to you and then sent away. That isn't marriage. I want to be yours. Here. In England. Where I can be close to you. Now. Always. Doris. My darling. It's tomorrow already. I can't give you up. That's war. You won't take foolish risks, will you darling? Don't worry about me, sweetheart. I always felt I was pretty lucky. And now I know I am. Barry. My Barry. Please. God keep you safe. I can't bear it. Mother. Don't. Don't cry, mother. I will come back. Don't cry, Mabel. Don't cry. Blimey, my number ain't up yet. Stay away from them French girls. - Don't worry about me, Mabel. The red lights of Paris don't need no help from you. Hush up, Mabel. Hush up. I never think of nothing like that. Except when I think of you. Heartbreaker. Doris. Doris. I was afraid you wouldn't arrive in time. I couldn't get off. I wanted to be early but had no time. That's alright, darling. Come on. Here is my car. You'll write me from Paris, won't you Barry? And don't keep anything from me if you get hurt. You sweet kid. Darling. Make them give you another leave soon. - Alright. And then we'll be married. - Yes. I will be yours. For always. Mine. The train. You must go. Take this. Bye, darling. - Write me. I'll write every day. - Take care of yourself. Want to go to The Savoy and dance? You know I can't. - Just this once. Have you forgotten what time I take your temperature in the morning? Good lord, no. The crack of dawn. Then be good and take me home. Alright. There's the car now. Miss Kendall. I've been hoping to see signs of you weakening. Weakening? Under the strain of that hospital work. So that I'd have a good excuse to cart you off to the country. But every time I see you, you're lovelier than ever. That's because I'm happy. When a woman admits she's happy she is invariably in love. I am. Terribly. With that American you spoke of? Yes. You are going to marry? When the war is over. I suppose I ought to be glad. But I am not. But I'll try to be for your sake. Thanks. You know, Wilfred. I'm glad I've told you. Thanks. When am I going to see you again? - Very soon. You've been a real friend, Wilfred. It's an experiment I seldom try. To be friends with a woman. Goodnight. - Goodnight. His Lordship and her Ladyship are in the morning room, Miss. Thank you. So you're off, my dear? Yes. I am catching the 11:05. - Ridiculous. A sick child like you going back to work in a London hospital. I'm quite alright now, Lord Ponsonby. Doris knows she's welcome to stop on another fortnight if she cares to. Of course she is. - I must get back. Besides, the duchess told you that they really needed me. And work always helps us to forget all our troubles. Rot. Goodbye, Lady Ponsonby. And thanks again. Goodbye, my dear. Wilfred is waiting for you outside. Yes. As long as you're in England, my dear. I want you to consider this place your home. You are a darling. James. I consider that last remark of yours entirely superfluous. Most remarks are. Now you are going to thank me. I know the look. - I can never thank you enough. Remember what you told me once? That you weren't good at .. - Saying thanks? I know. Alright. You're not going to let London upset you? You'll let me know if it does and come on down here again? I want you to see this old place under different conditions. I want you to like it. - I do. Doris. A friendship such as ours doesn't often exist. Then your experiment wasn't altogether a failure. Experiment? - Yes. About being friends with a woman. It was a failure. Oh. My feeling for you is not just friendship. It would be foolish to pretend that it was. I can't tell you now. What I would like to tell. But you know, Doris. And later on. Say in a month? Please. In a year perhaps? Time to go. Alright. Come along. If you were to ask me. I'd say that fellow was head over heels in love with her. Don't be an ass, James. Besides, she is an American. Ass or no ass, my angel. I repeat. The fellow is head over heels in love. Yes? Doris. It's come at last. At last. Now life can begin again. For all of us. Wilfred. You've been waiting to ask me something. To tell you I love you. I can't be without you. To ask you to be my wife. I can't. Ever. I want you to know now. You have been so chivalrous. So understanding. I don't want you to waste any more of yourself. Or time or love on me. Waste? Yes. It's no use. Not now. Not yet perhaps. But you'll not always feel this way. Wounds heal. Even the very worst of wounds. In time you will forget. And then. A new life will begin for you too. A new life? - Yes. You'll be happy. And until then I am willing to wait. You mustn't, Wilfred. You must forget me. I go back to America. - What good would that do? Stay here where I can see you. You. You like me? More than like. - Then stay. You will see. One day. - No. Never. Why never? I can't tell you. - You must. Surely I have a right to know. - You wouldn't want to. Doris. We are friends. And you ask me to go out of your life. To forget you. You say you can't marry me. Ever. Why? Wilfred. I am going to have a child. Now you understand? I hated hurting you. But I am happy about it. I have something to live for and work for back there in America. You are going to stay here. And marry me. That's so like you, Wilfred. But you know it's impossible. There's only one thing that's impossible. That you should go out of my life. I don't care what has gone before. I love you. Later, you will love me. Your child shall be my child. You don't know what you're saying. I want you, Doris. Doris. Listen to me. It's not out of chivalry that I ask you to do this. I'm not an infatuated boy. I know what I am doing. There have been women enough in my life. But you are the one. The only one I've wanted to marry. Yes. But it wouldn't be fair to you. Let me be the judge of that. And think of .. Your baby. It would be protected and bear my name. And Doris. I should love it because .. Because it was a part of you. I would find it more than fair. Say yes. And grant that this child now to be baptised therein. And may receive the fullness of Thy grace. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Name this child. Wilfred. James Edward. Wilfred James Edward. I baptise thee in the name of The Father. And of The Son. And of The Holy Ghost. Amen. I do hope he doesn't take after you, James. We receive this child into the congregation of Christ's flock. And do sign him. With the sign of the cross. In token that hereafter. He shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ our Lord. They served them for dinner at the palace the other day. And the dear old dowager ate so many of them. That she got the most frightful indigestion. But pronounced them excellent. Will you have another cup? - No thank you. Doris. There is the master of the house. Oh, the baby. Do let me see him, Lady Drake. - Of course. Bring him in, Tibbetts. Bring him in. Hello, old sportsman. Give him to me, Tibbetts. Here he is, Milady. He's just awakened. He'll be alright, Tibbetts. Come on. What an angel. - The darling. We've planned his whole life for him already. A private school. Then Dartmouth. And then the navy. The Drakes. You know. Sir Francis Drake. - Of course. Come here, my lad. Show them how you laugh. You'll drop him, Wilfred. You'll upset his little tummy. Nonsense. It's good for him. Isn't it, son? There's nothing like them, Tom. That's what I'm always telling Evelyn but .. I say. Isn't he like his father? The telephone for Your Ladyship. Captain Barry Craig. Captain ..? - Barry Craig. Your Ladyship. Forgive me. We're to think of these new ones coming into the world. Not knowing a thing about the war. The war? - Yes. The war. Yes. Yes. Barry. Barry, is this really you? - Yes, darling. I can't believe it. What happened? Where have you been? I'll tell you when I see you. - I don't know what to say. I'll come there right now. No, Barry. No. What do you mean, no? I'll tell you everything when I see you. I'm starting there now. Then why don't you come here? I'm at the Regent Hotel. But I am leaving for America. I must see you before I sail. I know you are married. What difference does that make? Barry, it makes all the difference in the world. Well, I'm coming. No. You can't. You mustn't come here. - Then you come here. I can't, Barry. I can't. I can't. Barry. [ Telephone ] Hello, Doris? Excuse me. - Certainly. You had better give the baby to Tibbetts now, Wilfred. Wilfred. - Yes? Tibbetts wants the baby. - Yes. He can stay until Her Ladyship comes, Sir Wilfred. You'd better take him, Tibbetts. I will see what is keeping her. Captain Craig? He is alive. What happened? I don't know. It has given you pretty much of a .. A jolt. It's only natural. Like a ghost. Is he ..? Is he coming .. Here? Oh no. He wanted .. - To see me. Of course. You will see him and tell him? About the child? - Oh, no. You know what I feel for you. What I feel for the child. It's his. It is ours. Yours and mine. For his sake no-one must ever believe differently. What do you take me for? You think I have no sense of loyalty or fair play? I am sorry. Forgive me. He is. He is going to America. If you do want to see him, well .. I don't want to see him, Wilfred. I will tell them downstairs that you are not feeling well. Thanks. Cheer up, Barry. Go and have a spot of Scotch and forget it. I'll never forget. Once in your life you love a woman. The rest don't count. Go on. Perhaps you'll meet someone on the boat. You're just a kid, Leslie. If you mean I've never been in love, you're wrong. I was eighteen. So was she, and we fell in love. We ran away together. - And got married. That was the idea but she wouldn't. So naturally, I wasn't a cad. I was mad about her but after three days she left me. And I swear to you Barry I treated her like a sister. Yeah? I was frightfully cut up about it at the time but .. I soon got over it just like you will. Barry, I may take a run over to America soon and if I do .. See who that is. - Yep. Hello. This is Captain Barry Craig's palatial apartment. Yes. Who? Barry, it is Lady Drake. - What? She is downstairs. Yes? Ask her to come up. Get out quick. Can I stop and meet her? - No. Get out. Won't you let me finish my drink? - No. Here is your coat. Hurry. Alright. Not out there. Go out through this room. Goodbye. - I'll call you again sometime. Toodle-oo. - Goodbye. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Oh my darling. Barry. We've got to be sensible. How beautiful you are. I want to hear all about you. Why didn't you write? How marvelous to see you. Why didn't you let me know you were alive? I was too ill. I didn't know a thing for weeks. Not even that the war was over. Then. One day at the hospital. I was still pretty bad. I saw a picture of you in the newspaper. And your husband. I thought you were dead. Then. After that I didn't want to write. All I wanted to do was to forget you. But I couldn't. And I can't. I would have waited forever. Now that you're here. Seeing you. I believe it. And now. We have to be sensible. Sensible? I'm married. - I know. You can't let a mistake spoil both our lives. But Barry, things don't stand still. Life has moved on for all of us. And you and I have been pulled apart. That's what I came here to tell you. So you can go back to America. And forget me, - I am going back to America. With you. That's foolish, Barry. - Foolish? To face things squarely? That's one good thing the war did for us. It taught us to be honest. You thought I was dead. You married another man. No matter if you stay married to him all your life. You are still mine. Barry, you're thinking only of yourself. Of you. And me. But there is .. There is Wilfred and .. And my baby. Your baby? A man you don't love and his child. What are they to do with us? I love you. I've found you again. And nothing in this world will ever make me let you go. Barry, I can't give them up. I can't. That's what I came here to say. You're lying when you say that. You came here because you had to come. Because .. You love me. - Oh no. I know. You are trying to be strong. And I admire you for it. You had courage that night. You believed in love. Above everything. Doris. Doris. Have courage now. Barry, don't. Don't. I'm not alone anymore. There is my baby and Wilfred. I don't suppose the war helped his nerves any. Darling, if you love me you must help me. We're both young. We have all our lives ahead of us. - Barry, please. It's worth it, my darling. It is worth being brave for. Brave. Barry. I am brave. I have courage. Courage to go on. And face life. With my husband. And my baby. Doris. Doris. Dinner is served, Sir Wilfred. Her Ladyship will not be down, Sir Wilfred. Doris. Not feeling well? I'll be alright. Can I have dinner sent up for you? You run along and have yours. You didn't go to Evelyn Kent's tea after all. No. I called there for you. I went somewhere else. Where? You have seen him. What happened? Don't be absurd, Wilfred. - I want to know what happened. Nothing. I suppose he called you up again. Hasn't that cad any sense of decency? - He's not a cad. What else do you call it? - I went there of my own accord. You went to his hotel? - Yes. You said you wouldn't see him. - I didn't intend to, Wilfred. I had to. You had to? Why? What for? Tell me what happened. I've told you, Wilfred. Nothing. Nothing. You spent the afternoon in his room. You come home white, trembling, ill. You expect me to believe nothing happened. You are lying. Stop shouting at me, Wilfred. So I get this for marrying you to save your reputation? For giving your child my name. - That's a lie. You married me for myself. - I expect loyalty. I am loyal. - To him. That's why you couldn't stay away. Why stand there lying? Why not admit it? I see it in your face. In your eyes. You belong to him. You love him. - Yes, yes. I love him. You're his. With all my heart. With all my soul. With all my body! With all. Your. Body. Why didn't you stay with him? What did you come back here for? - Because .. Because you wanted what I can give you. But I'm unwilling keep on living with a woman who's the property of another man. Alright. Go to him. I'll give you your lover. And your freedom. Barry. This affair has distressed me. More than I can say. Divorce is an unpleasant business in any case. In my experience I've found that we English are wiser .. If we marry women who are .. Well, English. Perhaps so. I'm terribly grateful to you, Sir John. You have the law to thank, Sir Wilfred. Not me. Wilfred. Don't you think it may be as well .. If we told her ourselves? She has her lawyers. I'm afraid she's going to take this awfully hard. Let's tell her ourselves. We can do it gently. I hate scenes. Where is Her Ladyship, Roberts? - Upstairs, Sir Wilfred. Ask her to come down, will you. - Very good, Sir. Wait. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Doris. Hi, uncle James. Tibbetts. Come here. Doris. Well. It's done, isn't it uncle James. Well. Was it really necessary? Well. I would have been willing to stick it but .. Wilfred was right. It would not have been a marriage. No. I suppose not. Have you .. Have you made any plans .. About your future? I am going back to America. I'll make a home there for the baby and myself. We'll be alright. And you have been a darling. Doris. Yes? The child. He. He's not altogether yours, you know. You're almost as fond of him as though he were your own. You'll have to come to America someday and see him. I'm afraid it will have to be the other way round. You will have to come here. Why? What for? To see the child. The court. Wilfred. Yes. But .. But Wilfred would never dream of anything like that. He's my child. You see, dear. You don't understand. I hate to tell you, my dear. But the court. Awarded the boy .. to Wilfred. To Wilfred? Yes. But that's just the court. A legal technicality. Did he agree? To let you have him? - Of course. We never even discussed it. You should have, my dear. But uncle James. Wilfred would never dream of anything like that. He is my child. You see, you do not understand. You will have to give him up. Give him up? He is Wilfred's child as well as yours. He is his heir. He didn't tell you that? You must be mistaken. He is my child. He's not even .. Where is Wilfred? I must see him. - Downstairs. He will tell you. Wilfred. What's this uncle James has tells me about you wanting to keep the child? You weren't surprised by the court? The court has nothing to do with us. You know that. You cannot be serious. Did you expect to rob me of him too? - Rob you? You are mad. - Not in the eyes of the law. You'll take advantage of that? Wilfred, that's impossible. You wouldn't. You couldn't. You said yourself he was ours. That was before there was any thought of divorce. You should have considered that before. When you married me you agreed that I was to be the child's father. I have been a father to him. He is mine. Through your own doing. By law. By every right there is. And he's going to remain mine. He is not. He is not. He is my child. He is nothing to you. Nothing. You only do this to punish me. It's not a question of punishment. It's horrible. Horrible. He's my baby. My flesh and blood. There's no law that can change that. There's nothing you can do. - I won't give him up. I won't! I have full custody. The best thing for you is to forget you ever had a child. You mean .. You mean I'm not even to see him? It will be better for both of you. But Wilfred. - I have .. I have provided for you. Do you think I'll take your money? I want my child! I'll fight for him. I'll fight through the laws in the whole world. I'll tell everyone the truth. That you're not his father. That he's mine. Only mine. You wouldn't dare. - I'd dare anything. Go into court then. Tell them the truth. Tell them that I'm not his father. Brand him for what he really is. The baby's bath is ready, Your Ladyship. That's all, sir. - Thank you. Good afternoon. Has Mr Barry Craig arrived yet? Mr Darrow calling. Barry Craig? I'll see if he's arrived, sir. Leslie. Barry. Barry. You. Why didn't you radio me from the boat? I'd have met you. You look like a million dollars. - It's like old times. Seeing you again. How does London strike you after .. How long is it? - Two years. Two years. It seems only yesterday you threw me out of your room before I finished my drink. Come on. We'll make up for it now. - Alright. Come on. Yes. I tell you, old boy. If things don't pick up soon I'll pry some cash out of the adoring family .. And bung off to Brazil or Cape Town or some other dismal place. Ever see any of the old crowd anymore? - Yes. Once in a blue moon I bung into one of them. Ever happened to run into Lady Drake? Lady Drake? Yes. Well. I thought that you and she were .. You thought what? I thought she went back to America after the divorce. She's divorced? Why, yes. Ages and ages ago. Just after you left. It was all very sudden and mysterious but .. Naturally, we all thought that .. That you and she were .. Barry, you've gone as white as a sheet. I hope I haven't said anything. She's been in America two years? Yes. So I understand. Her lawyers would know. I've got to find her. A gentleman to see you, ma'am. - I can't see anyone. What's up? You are all of a fluster. Have you found a job? - I wish I had. Don't worry. My luck's changed. I soon will. I hope so. I'd like to think you have some work to do soon. Doris. Barry. I saw Leslie Darrow. He told me that .. - I can't believe it's you. I got your address only this morning. I came right away. I am glad I caught you. Yes. Come in here and let's talk. - I can't now, Barry. There's so much I want to know. Finding you here in this awful place. Yes. It is rather awful, isn't it. But it doesn't matter. Nothing matters now. Barry, I'm going to see my baby. I just got a message an hour ago. I haven't seen him in two whole years. Not since the divorce. The court gave Wilfred custody. He wouldn't let you see your own child? He was angry because .. - Why didn't you let me know? Why didn't you come to America? I couldn't. The baby. You would not understand. But everything will be alright now. I hope. Imagine you coming here today. It's so funny. He'll be running around talking. I wonder who he'll look like. Me or ..? Or his father. Barry. I'll drive you there. No, Barry. - Why not? Impossible. You're too upset to go anywhere alone. - I'm alright. Please. No, Barry. And you mustn't come here again. It might spoil everything. You see, darling. You were the cause of all the trouble before. I'm afraid if Wilfred thought that .. That.
