Good music, good chats and the latest news, right here on 98.9FM. Bok Radio. The 2016 Comic Expo starts at Emperors' Palace in Kempton Park, just outside Johannesburg, later today. It's the biggest display of mainly comic books, video games, computer technology, science fiction, fantasy and similar pop arts and culture. And thousands of enthusiastic supporters descend on Comic Expo yearly, and none other than Cape Town's own comic book celeb, Jay van Niekerk, is on his way there to release his new comic. Jay, welcome to Bok Radio. Thank you, Wynand, it's nice talking with you. You became well-known quite quickly when Bucky started appearing in various magazines and now your comic books are selling like hot cakes. What makes this little bird so special? Well, Wynand, Bucky is a blue budgie with a samurai sword, who keeps our streets clean. And he finds himself in interesting scenarios. When he's not battling a green monster and alley cats, he pops into a matrix. I read Bucky in the Matrix, and it was really cool. Your last issue, Bucky and the Rhino Poachers, was a runaway hit. Yes, I think it's because I tackled such a relevant topic. In our country, rhino poaching is an epidemic and I had to write about it at some point or another. I agree with you completely. But do you think that the new one, Bucky and the Jailbirds, will reach the same heights? Well, Wynand, I don't want to give anything away, but this one is very special to me. Jay! What's taking so long? We're going to be late! Damn it... Your fly's open... A good business doesn't close. Quite a lot, in fact Mom Oh, damn it. Jay, it's Mom. Where are you? Dad had a heart attack and he's in the hospital. Jay! The doctor says he doesn't think he's going to make it, you have to come right away. Where are you? Jay! Come on! We're waiting just for you. Are you alright? My dad's sick. My mom's just worried about him. Will he be okay? I don't know... but she usually overreacts. Oh well... let's go be celebrities. Who do I make it out to? There you go. Thanks. -Who do I make it out to? -To Paul. There you go. -Wow... it's so cool to meet you. -Who do I make it out to? -Pieter. -Pieter... I love your comic book. You should make a movie. -We're working on a TV series... -Seriously? -Yes! -It's going to be so cool! -How's it going? Who do I make it out to? -Durandt. Okay. Sorry... Jay, I quickly need to speak to you. Excuse me. I'll be with you in a moment. Dude, your mom says your dad isn't doing well. I don't want to hear about your dad's stubbornness or blah, blah, blah, okay? She says it's serious. Now, listen to me. You don't want this thing on your conscience. -Okay. -Okay? Let me just finish with the last few fans, then we can go. Okay, cool. -Here you go... -Hi. -Thank you. -How are you? -Alright, thanks. -Who do I make it out to? Hey... here's your ticket. You're flying to George in 45 minutes. What about you? I'm going back to the Cape. Someone needs to hold the fort. Burger... Hey... You take your time now, as long as you need. I'll put the rest of the tour on ice until you're ready. Family comes first. Let me know how your dad's doing, okay? Off you go, you have to board. Mom, I'm on my way. I'm boarding now. -Thanks, man. -You're welcome. -Jay! -Hello, Lina. He's here, ma'am! -Good morning, Jay. -Morning, Lina. -How long has she been busy out there? -Since early this morning. She simply doesn't stop. It's how she mourns. Everyone does it differently. She's very happy you're here, Jay. -Here, take this to her. I'll make breakfast so long. -Thank you. -Hello, my child. Did you sleep well? -Very well. My dad was an impressive man. And yet uncomplicated. He asked little of those around him and expected only the best from everyone he loved. To me, my dad's best quality was his patience. And his ability to just listen. Only give his opinion when it mattered. His wisdom was unparalleled. Dad had a long and happy life and... he enriched my mom's life with... with love and support. It's hard to comprehend that he's not here anymore and... I'm not sure how to handle it. We're all here to commemorate his life. To remember the impact he had on each of our lives. To say goodbye and bid farewell to a lively, worthy soul. A soul that brought joy and fulfilment to many of us. And whose legacy will live on forever. We'll miss you, Dad. John chapter 14. Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. Bloody paparazzi... I'm not that famous! Come out from behind there, you rubbish! I'm not paparazzi! I don't even know who you are. -I'm sorry, I thought you were taking pictures of me. -I was. So you are paparazzi! South Africa doesn't even have paparazzi, you freak! Whoa! I'm sorry. -I'm just taking pictures. For a book. -What book? A photo album about life. You looked so sad here on your own, it made for a nice picture. Not really your scene? No. So who checked out? Excuse me? I asked who died, it doesn't look like you're very interested. It's my dad. I am so sorry, I don't know... I don't know what to say. So why are you hiding here? Doesn't your family need you? Clearly someone doesn't know how to guard her tongue. Oh, you won't understand. Go back to taking pictures of your ghosts and leave me alone. -Good luck. -Drive safe. -There, there, my child. Okay... it's alright. -I'm sorry, Mom. If I hadn't been so stubborn, I could've made it in time. If you weren't so stubborn, you wouldn't have been anything like your dad. I just feels like I always disappointed him. I couldn't even make it in time to say goodbye. My poor child... come with me, I want to show you something. You sit, I'll get it. -I remember this old wreck. -We did everything in this car... Oh, we were so in love... That's where you came from, from that day. Oh, your dad was so proud of you. You need to know that your dad came from an era where men weren't taught to show warmth towards their sons. They were all exposed to conscription and war. But he loved you very much, make no mistake. I'm going to make us some tea. Okay? -Morning, Jay... -Morning. -Morning, Lina. -Morning, ma'am. -Morning, Jay. -Morning, Mom. Wow, that looks good. You went to too much trouble again, Mom. Oh, nonsense! It's not every day that we have you here to spoil. Hey! Manners! Thank you, Lina. You say grace so long. -Bless this food and make us truly thankful. Amen. -Amen. -I'll have to go back to the Cape. -Oh, no! So soon? I've been here a week, Mom, I need to get back to work. We're touring with the new Bucky series and I can't postpone it any longer. Well when do you have to go back then? I can stay another day or two but then I have to go. And now? Quickly come with me. Come on! Come on. Where are we going? Walk, walk, walk... And this? Your dad had been restoring her the last couple of months. -Isn't she beautiful? -I didn't know Dad could fix cars. Oh, he so badly wanted to take her for a last, long ride on the open road. But now you can do it, right? -I don't know, Mom... does the thing even run? -Yes! Well, golly... I think so. I don't think I want it, Mom. I don't know anything about old cars. Jay... See it as a last farewell to your Dad. Because you couldn't say goodbye in person. -Okay, Mom. But what if it breaks down? -It's a her, a car isn't an it. -What if she breaks down? -Then you just get her fixed. But she won't. For the road... Thank you, Lina. -Goodbye, you guys. -Bye! Cheers, Jay. Do I have to treat you like a lady first? Don't wait months before visiting again, you hear? Remember, I'm all alone now! You're not alone, you have Lina, Mom. But I'll visit again soon, I promise. Okay. -Bye! -Drive safe, my child! Bye! -Good morning, sir, can I help you? -Yes... fill up, LLP, I think. -Oil and tyres, water, all fine, sir? -Everything's fine, thanks. Thank you very much, sir. -Hey... nice car. -You too. -Where are you headed? -Home. -Okay... where's home? -Cape Town. If the car doesn't send me to a shallow grave. Well, I'm also headed that way. We can set her on fire if you'd like, and you can ride with me. You live inside a movie. It's my dad's old car. It's supposed to be a final farewell to him, so... By the way... It's Ally. Filled her up, the petrol is R450. Thank you very much. -Thanks. -Thank you, sir. Go well! Ouch! -Yes, Champ? -Burger, thank goodness. Listen, I have to talk quickly, my battery's going to die. -Jay... Hello? -Hello? -Nice one, dude! -Hey! Oh, come on! Are you okay? Yes, sort of. -It does look like you need a bit of help... -What makes you think that? Just because I'm stranded next to the road without a cell phone doesn't mean I need help, okay? Well, you can use mine. But I don't know who will come and help you out here. Thank you... -Hello? -Burger, thank goodness. Jay! I tried phoning you, but it goes straight to voicemail. Where are you? Listen, I have a huge problem. My car broke down next to the highway -and I'm stranded in the middle of nowhere. -What car? It's a long story. I think I'll need to be towed. I'm a few kilometres outside Brakrivier. -What happened? -I don't know, the thing started billowing smoke -and then it just stopped. -It's the water pipe, it burst. -And who is that? -It's just someone who's helping me. -Can you organise a tow truck for me? -Is she cute? -Burger, focus! Can you organise something? -Yes, of course. But it's going to take a while, -you're in the middle of nowhere. -Just organise something for me, please. I'll send you my location. It's a blue Ford Zephyr from 19-whatever. Alright. Just as long as you're... Hello? -Everything okay? -You don't have an extra radiator, do you? Golly, no. But my offer still stands if you need a ride to Cape Town. Well, the trip can't get any worse, can it? No, it can only get better. You're not a weirdo, are you? As long as I take my meds, I should be fine. If this is your doing to organise grandkids for Mom, I don't think it's funny, Dad. -It's... Ally, right? -See? I'm not a stranger anymore. Sorry for being so short before, I've just been going through a rough time lately. Water under the bridge. Oh, wait! Hello, people. This is Ally and this is... Jay. And that's Jay's car over there... Mom and Dad, if I disappear, it's this guy's fault. -What's with you and the video? -I upload it to my blog. So what kind of blog is it? Are you a photographer, or what? No... not a professional one. I just blog about life. Just never let the opportunity for a good picture pass you by. Yes, like walking in the rain. Speaking of water, if you're thirsty, there's water and road soda in the cooler. -Water... road soda. -Water's fine, thanks. This van of yours is getting more and more impressive. Cute, right? She was a gift from my dad, just after I graduated. Clearly it worked out better for you than it did for me. The car, I mean. -What did you study? -BCom Law. But I've never practiced. You? Graphic Design and Animation. I sketch comic books for a living. So you are a bit of a celebrity. No, things like that don't really bother me. And he's modest too! Listen, I'm really sorry about the thing with the stones... Yes, it was taken a bit far... -I have an idea to make the trip less awkward. -That sounds good. We can play a game. Do you know Never Have I Ever? -No, I don't think so. -What? We played it every weekend at varsity. It's the best way to get to know someone and it's fun. Okay, so how it works is you have to sketch a scenario that you think the other person has experienced, but you haven't. It's actually a drinking game, so when you're right, I need to have a drink; if I'm right, you need to have a drink. -And so on. -Makes sense, sort of. But how do we know who's won and who's lost? Well, usually the one that gets drunk first, loses. But in this case it won't work, so let's just play. Okay. Okay, the rules are as follow: Number one, you have to be 100% honest, no secrets. -Otherwise the game is meaningless. -What if it's something I don't want to admit? No, but you have to. Because I promise to be honest, and then you have to too. -Okay. -Number two, your scenarios have to be creative. You can't say something like, 'Never have I ever worn a dress.' -Because of course you've never worn a dress. -How would you know? Okay, I'll go first to give you an introduction. Never have I ever thrown rocks at a complete stranger. Go on, now you have to take a sip to admit it. Okay. So I'd say something like... Never have I ever taken pictures of a stranger in a cemetery. Perfect. Let's make it creative, because we're not going to get sloshed on water. That's true. Let's say for every scenario that you guess correctly, the other person has to take remove something from their body. So the person who gets naked first, loses. -Are you sure we can't have beer instead? -Are you scared? -No. Okay then. -Never have I ever regretted something. Don't tell me you've never done something that you felt guilty about. Even when you were a kid? Go on, then! Take something off, you clearly regret something. And in retrospect, no. It made me who I am today. That was a trick question. -The rules say you should be creative! -Okay. Never have I ever owned a pink van. Okay, my own medicine. But we can't create obvious scenarios. Never have I ever gone paragliding. I thought you said the scenarios have to be interesting. But it is interesting. I've never gone paragliding and I want to know if you have. -Nope. Never. -Okay, your turn. -No, that was a lame question. -Oh, come on! You're just trying to stall because you don't know what to say next. I can't help it if you ask such lame questions. Never have I ever made a living from drawing comics. What? Your comic book, what's it about? Bucky. A crime-fighting budgie. It's stupid, I know. Well, never have I ever posted videos of myself on the internet. -You still owe me a shoe. -Well, you still owe me an earring. Take the wheel. You're not going to make it to the next town. I don't feel like playing this game anymore. Oh, come on... let's go for a dip. Just look at that nice pool down there. -Why? -Because it looks like you need to cool down. Are you coming? -Are we allowed to swim here? -Life's too short! Come on! Eyes on the road, sir. Sorry, sorry! You idiot! I thought I told you to keep your eyes on the road. Not close them. Hey! What the hell was that? This is me. Here we are. Yup. Thanks again for the ride. It's a big pleasure. Wait... We should keep in touch. Why not? Life's too short, Jay van Niekerk. -Hey! -How's it going? Did you manage to get that old wreck towed? Yes, I found someone. They'll drop it off here tomorrow. Thanks. Wait, first tell me who that girl in the pink pleasure van is... What? Come on! I'm taking a shower. Hey Who are you I'm joking hi Thanks for the lift today you saved my life It was a fun adventure What are you doing? Enjoy What are you doing? Blushing Haha are you going to bed early tonight No, why? Great get ready I'm picking you up Okay -Beautiful, isn't it? -Yes, it is. Sometimes I wish I could die right here. With Table Mountain as my tombstone and the sand of the Cape seas as my final resting place. For a cheerful person you're pretty morbid. It's not morbid. It's poetry. Okay. Speaking of morbid, why does it look as if the whole of Table Mountain is resting on your shoulders? Yes, it's a bit crazy up here. I've neglected my family this past while. There's an expo here, an expo there, deadlines... It's a total rape of my soul. Sorry for laughing... But that might just be the best title for your autobiography one day. Rape of My Soul, the Jay van Niekerk story. No one will read that. I'd buy it. Only because you'd be in it. Is that right? You're on a few pages already. What do I need to do to get a whole chapter? You could be my girlfriend... I'm joking, I'm only joking! I'm crazy about this. Let's dance! -Here? -Yes, here. Where else? -I have two left feet. -I'll make up for it with my two right feet. I'm apologising in advance for stepping on your toes. You'll be alright. -You're strange. -And that's why I'll be your girlfriend. I was only joking, honestly... Don't ruin the moment. And now? The moon... he's not allowed to see. Hey... What are you working on? Oh, nothing, I just had an inspiring moment. At two o'clock in the morning? Show me? Show me... It's cute... It's Barefoot Becky. They're going to make an awesome team. I want you to meet my parents. Sounds ominous... Just one thing... my dad's a bit overprotective. Overprotective? They've invited us to a barbecue this afternoon. Okay. -Are you okay? It looks like you've seen a ghost. -Yes, I'm fine. I look forward to meeting them. My dad's going to like your car, I'm telling you. He loves classic cars. Mine isn't pink! Well, at least they'll see I have my own car. Oh, they're not bothered about things like that, my parents are very down to earth. Down to earth folks, you say? It's only earthly things. Life is too short to worry about what people think of you. That's easy to say when your house looks like this. -Hello, my little flower! -Hello, Mom. -Hello, Dad. -My child! -And this must be the boyfriend... -Jay van Niekerk, ma'am. Just call me Anita. Wine! That's kind of you. Oh... Barry...? -Afternoon, sir. -Barry Schwartz. Pretty zef [kitsch], isn't it? Excuse me, sir? Ford Zephyr. -Oh yes, Ally tells me you like classic cars, sir. -Don't call me sir, I'm not your employer. Well, come in, we're only waiting for one more guest. Who would that be? Dewald. He's just back from his trip to the Congo. He phoned earlier to ask if he could come by, I hope you don't mind. -No, Dad. -Who's Dewald? -My broker. -And my ex. Oh. That's unexpected. Now that's a car... -Hello, people, hello! -Dewald, my old friend! -Barry, you old devil! How are you? -All's well, my man! My goodness, is this what I think it is? '76 Bordeaux; I didn't know there were any left in the country! There aren't... -Anita... Beautiful, as always. -Oh, thank you, Dewald! Barry, if you don't stop me I'm going to steal your bird right out from under you yet. And who's this, Barry? I didn't know you have another child. Oh no, he's not anything to us, he's just a friend of Ally's, James. -Jay. -He's my boyfriend. Oh... but this must be a bit awkward for you, hey? -Dewald. Van der Walt. Ally... -Dewald. You grow more beautiful by the day. -Well, let's go inside, people. -Come on! Yes. And the next thing I knew, the guide was in the tree, of course, and I thought to myself, listen dude, lions can climb trees too. I mean, he's the guide, he should know these things. Look, I've been in lots of tricky situations, but this time... I really thought it was the end. -So what did you do? -I did what any Boer boy would do... I faced my fear. And I looked straight into that lion's eyes... When he came closer, I slapped him hard on the nose and shouted: Beat it! Sounds like Crocodile Dundee. This is Africa, daddy'o. Not a movie. Look, you have to make him understand that you're the alpha because then you can confuse any wild animal for a moment. Well luckily there was another game ranger that heard our cry for help. There was a gunshot and the lion was gone. I... I almost died that day. And what did you say you do for a living? I'm an investment broker but that just pays my salary. Oh, Dewald is actually much more of a philanthropist, you know... Child welfare in Africa, that type of thing. Oh, Anita, you make me sound like a saint! I'm actually just a normal guy that wants to make a difference in this life. Nonsense! What about that time in Uganda... When you rescued the little black boy from the female gorilla who took him for one of her own? That's not racist at all... Excuse me, James, I didn't hear that clearly...? I said, that sounds fantastic. It's Jay, Barry. Not James. -So what do you do for a living, James? -Jay creates comic books. -They're very popular. -Yes, well, I write and sketch, yes. -What are comic books about? -A crime-fighting budgie. Yes, first it was a magazine feature and now it's being published. What do you get paid for a little job like that? Dad! How are those coals, I think we can get the barbecue going, can't we? Relax, everyone, I'll cook the meat. Barry... I insist on it. I just learned this new barbecue technique that I'd like to try out. Well, alright then. James, why don't you pour each of us a glass of that wine you brought. Fine. Hey... Are you okay? Yes, why wouldn't I be? I don't know... It just doesn't look like you're having the best time. Yes, well, your dad clearly doesn't like me. And your photoshopped ex is clearly the best thing that's ever happened to you. What? No, he isn't. What are you talking about? It just feels like you threw me into the deep end here, I wasn't prepared. Oh, so it's my fault. No... I'm sorry. I'll be right there. Bloody asshole. -Hey, what took you so long? -Yay! I tried opening a screw-top with a corkscrew. Shame... I'm sorry... -That was simply delicious! -Yes, indeed, Dewald! You impress me more and more each day. Don't you agree, Ally? I suppose... it tasted good, thanks. -And now? What's wrong? -No, no, it was delicious. I just got a spasm. Hey, I can help you out, buddy. I learned this trick when I was doing humanitarian work in Thailand... -No, that's really not necessary... -Relax, buddy, just relax. Okay... breathe in. And one, two... three! -Oh, dear heavens... -And? Yes, it... it feels good. -A miracle worker! -You see? I told you so, buddy! Come on little flower, help Mommy clear the table. Ladies, I hope you'll excuse us... Barry, didn't you say you have a Cuban surprise? Yes, now you're talking. And I actually have a single malt that will compliment it very well. Come on through to the study. Drinks... Cigars are in that corner cabinet. This is an incredible stone, is it real? Yes, it was a gift from Dewald, after one of his trips up in Africa. Barry usually finances all of the welfare work I do on that side and... That was a gift from a Congolese tribal leader. -I would have kept it for myself. -I wanted to, but Barry deserves it more than me. Oh, you know... Gentlemen, excuse me for a moment, I just need to send off a fax. This is really nice. So you write Bucky comics. Yup. I've always wondered what the money is like in that industry. It's not bad... It's a tough industry but I'm happy. I don't earn millions but I do okay. And here, the men are involved in important discussions the women can't know anything about. Look, I don't want to brag but I do make millions. It's not that difficult, it's more a case of right place, right time. African mines. If you ever need some advice, I'm here to help. Wow. Thanks, man. That's nice of you. Hey, any time, buddy. Any friend of Ally's is a friend of mine. Boring... You actually make a nice couple. You know, you're actually a nice guy. Did you think I wouldn't be? Well, I didn't know what to expect. -So far it's been a bit awkward. -Yeah... You know, Ally is actually a fantastic girl. Yup, she is. And you know it's not going to work out, right? What's that now? Look, Jay, you're a nice guy. So I'm going to be straight with you, I think you deserve that much. -You can't have her back. -Be realistic... Okay, how long do you think it will last? It's just a matter of time until she comes to her senses. She's going through a phase and after that phase, she'll come back to me. I just want to prepare you, buddy. -You know what? I take it back, you're actually... -Gentlemen. The ladies are looking for us. Tonight I'm in the mood for cracking open an expensive one. Come on. Dewald! Shit... Dance, Mommy! -Excuse me... -Hi! Fuck... What's wrong now? I want to go home, it was a mistake coming here. I can't stand people like these. -Excuse me? -What did you say? Who do you think you're talking to? This isn't your mommy's house. Let go of me! Dewald! What do you think you're doing? I'm leaving. Sorry for ruining your evening. What the hell? I didn't take it. I am so disappointed in you. I was just starting to like you. How do you expect me to trust you with my daughter? -I promise I didn't take... -Get out of here before I call the police. Ally... Hey, buddy, didn't you hear him? Fuck off. Your kind doesn't belong here, buddy. Please... not now. Hey, Sam, hey. What's up? Dewald... Where's my money? Yes, relax, relax, I've made a plan. You better not be playing games with me. You have five days. -Yes, yes, I get it. -Or you're dead! -Buddy... -Okay... -Dead! -Okay, Sam. -Five days... -Cheers, Sam, bye. Where were we, brother? Oh, Mommy... I'm here, I'm here, my child. -I'm sorry, Mommy. -It wasn't your fault, my little flower. The whole affair is just an unfortunate mess. But it doesn't make sense. Sometimes people do stupid things. 5 days later... -What? -Jay? Where are you? I've called 100 times. -Just leave me alone. -Dude, you can't mope around forever. I'm on my way to Dusty's for drinks. Should I pick you up or meet you there? No... I'll meet you there. Okay, see you there in half an hour. -Ally! How's it going? -Hey, Burger. Fine, thanks. I'm looking for Jay, I've called his phone but it just rings. I know he probably doesn't want to talk to me but I need to see him. I'm on my way to Dusty's but I'll tell him you're looking for him, okay? Okay. Thank you. Sam, buddy! What's up? Yes, I know where that is. Cool, see you there in five. Okay. Excuse me, barman? Do you have a pen I can borrow? Waitress! Three draughts over here. Sam, you look well! -How's it going, buddy? -I don't have time for your chit-chat bullshit, man. -Where's the gemstone, Dewald? -Okay. Feast your eyes... on this. Unbelievably beautiful, isn't it? A golden sapphire from the Congo. It's worth much more than I owe you. Take it. But then I don't owe you anything anymore. Is that in order? -Test the thing. -You can't do that in public. The gem has blood on it. If you're taking me for a ride... For your sake, I hope this thing is for real. Otherwise I'll cut you up into little pieces and send you back to your people. Come on, Pumbaa, let's go. -Jay! -You sly bastard. -Hey, it's not what you think! -Isn't it? Because to me it looked like you stole Barry's stone that so conveniently fell from my pocket. -You wouldn't understand. -Oh, so there's an explanation? They wanted to kill me, okay? I'm sorry man, didn't mean for you to get caught in the crossfire. And the stone that's still at Barry's house? It's a knock-off, I swopped the two. What? I'm sorry. I can't let you get away with this. I'm not going to fall for your bullshit. Millions from investments in African mines? You're a sociopath, man! And what are you going to do about it? I'm going to the police. And telling Ally the truth. I can't let you do that. You're not in a position to negotiate, your fan club isn't here. Jay! Ally! Don't leave me now. There's always that one... the one you dream about. That makes your stomach turn. The one whose touch always stays with you. You're that one to me, Ally. I have... I have a physical pain in my heart from what I'm feeling. I can't... I don't want to... go on without you. I need you, Ally. I just want to be with you. I want to look into your eyes and tell you I yearn for you. You're beautiful to me. And I want to make you happy and I want to kiss you until you're all out of breath. Ally? Ally! Ally! Someone, help! Now I'll write you free. Because bound, you'll strangle me. At the end of love, someone must perish. Tonight, it will be me. I love you, Ally. A few weeks later... Ally and Jay Hello, people. So today is the day that I introduced Jay to the parents... poor man. In any case, I think they kind of like him. Everyone's still alive, at least. And this is just a part of my parents' house... And the TV... Over there.... My dear mommy, Anita, is hiding. And we are in the mood for dancing tonight. There we go... And this is my dearest mommy's daughter, Ally. You look so happy, Ally. -What's your secret? -It must be love. -And lots of water. -Then it must be that James boy... -Mom! -I'm only joking! -Do you like this Jay boy? -Yes. And? Do you love him? Yes. I do love him. I love you, Jay. My dearest Ally The minutes have become hours by now and the hours, days. Every day I realise more and more that life's too short. Too short not to laugh. Too short to drink cheap wine. Too short to beat around the bush. Too short not to take chances. And life is too short not to love. Once in a lifetime, you have the chance to love someone with everything that moves in your being. If you're lucky. Most people never even realise it. Just like I almost missed it when we met. It's so unfair that you've been taken away from me and words can't describe how much I miss you. Except with just as much abandon as I loved you. My life doesn't make sense without you. When I concentrate hard enough, I can still see you. Sometimes I can even feel my arms folding around your body. And your fingertips caressing my face. I can even smell your hair. Peppermint shampoo. And I can still taste the apricot of your lips. How will I ever be able to carry on without you, my love? Without you awakening and tantalising my senses. But I simply have to. I'm not worried much... Because I know I'll be able to swim with you in the waters of the Tradouw pass forever. And if I stop in Plattekloof at night, I'll see you dancing in the full moon. At least the moon is allowed to watch again now. I say goodbye to you, my dearest Ally, but it's not farewell. Until I see you again, yours forever and as long as the earth keeps turning. This life is very short, isn't it? And the one regret I have is never taking the chance to tell you that I love you. I hope you can still hear me, wherever you might be. I love you, Ally. Quite a lot, in fact.
