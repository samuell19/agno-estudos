SOME PEOPLE DECIDED TO ISOLATE THEMSELVES TO ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE AND MADNESS. ISOLATE [loud thunderclap] [eerie high-pitched ringing] [echoing] [heavy breathing] [breathing heavily] [heavy breathing] [groaning] [rapid breathing] [gasps] [wind howls] Mama. - What is it? - My potty has broken. It's alright, love. We'll make you another. Do you need to go to the outhouse? Salvador... [Salvador groans] Yes, yes. [door creaks] [wind howls] [heavy breathing] [soft eerie music plays] [branches creaking] [window rattles] [door opens] Come on, push. Get out! [small trickle] Be quicker! Come out quickly, I said. [wind howls] [ominous music plays] - [banging] - [Salvador] Hurry up, Diego! [urinating] [relieved sigh] [Mama] My love? [Mama] Come and lie down. There. There's nothing to be afraid of. Your feet are so cold! [Diego] Yours are too. No, yours are colder than mine. [Diego] No, yours are. Goodnight, Mum. - [Mama] Goodnight. - [Diego whispers] Goodnight. - [wind howls] - [insects chirp] [heavy breathing] [Salvador] As I showed you. - [Diego whimpers] - [Salvador] Do it, Diego. Hit it! [rabbit squeals] [Salvador] Hit it! [rabbit squeals] - [Salvador] Hit it. Hit it hard! - [rabbit squeals] - [Salvador] Don't be afraid. Hit it. - [Diego whimpers] [Salvador] Come on now! Come on, Diego! - [Salvador groans] - [Diego] No! [Diego breathes heavily] [Diego] No! No. [ominous music plays] [Mama] Diego! [she sighs] You don't have to if you don't want to, my love He needs to learn to be a man. Yes, perhaps another day, though. No, it has to be today. Come here, Diego. Come, Diego. Help me with the potatoes. Come on. [Mama] How good you are at peeling potatoes. [Diego chuckles] [Mama] Here, let's have a look. The leaves, underneath them, they're fine. Pay attention to me. Better. See? But when we look inside, there are many flies, you see? - Hmm... Mama. - Yes? What will happen to the little rabbit that ran beyond the limits? [inhales deeply] [Mama] The posts your father put up, what are they for? [Diego] To remind us that beyond them, there is only war. [Mama] That's right, so nothing good can happen to him. [wind howls] What about people, then? They must also die like the goats and the rabbits in the yard always do. What are you asking? If they disappear forever, I mean? Yes. It's not possible to ever see them again? [inhales deeply] Well, um... if you close your eyes for a moment, it's possible you can. Shall we go and feed the rabbits? [chuckles] Come on! [she chuckles] [Mama] Come on in, my love. - [chickens clucking] - Hello! How was your night's sleep? Tell me. Never mind, here's your breakfast. [laughing] Grab it, grab it! - Hang on, hang on! Grab it from there. - [both laughing] Oh, my... my goodness me! - That was for the longest ever. - [Diego] How long? [Mama] Twenty-three. You'll come up with a fish face next time. Tell me, how have they been treating you, Lion? Don't fear. I'll speak to them, I promise. Because you're still little, you hear? Like this, then this and this. Like this, then this, then this. [she laughs] [soft upbeat music plays] - [Mama] Shall we race? - [Diego] All right, I'll beat you! [she laughs] [soft upbeat music continues] [music ends] [wind howls] [musical box plays slow, soft tune] [music continues] [Salvador sighs] [floorboard creaks] [Salvador] Diego! [music continues] [she sniffs deeply] What are you doing spying on me? Come on in. Is that your dress, Mama? It was a gift given to me by your Papa. He made it himself before we started living here. So, why don't you ever put it on, then? [Mama] Come on, make a wish. [Mama chuckles] [Mama] Let's try it, shall we? I don't know how it works. I'll show you. It's easy. Watch me. With this lever, you can open it. You load a cartridge in here. You load the other one in here. Then we close it. Hold it firmly, take aim. [Diego breathes shakily] And then you fire. Do you understand? - Yes, Papa. - Let's try it. It's a gift for when you're older. - The child has to mature. - Not yet, he doesn't. Diego, come with me. Diego... here's mine. [metal clangs] I can't go any further back. [Mama laughs] Put it on your ear. Fine. [Mama whispers] I spy... [she laughs] You have to ask me the question. - [whispering] I spy... - [Diego] What do you see? [Mama whispers] A little something. [whispers] And the colour is? [Mama whispers] The colour is... [insects chirping] [Mama] So, that same night, a knock on the door startled them. [in spooky voice] "María... give me back the guts you took from me!" And the boy said, "Mama, who could that be? Who could that be?" "Be quiet, son, for he shall go away." [in spooky voice] "No, my boy. I shall not leave because I'm already climbing the stairs." [they laugh] Then... Ha! A little scratching of wood on the windowsill. [gasps] Loud breathing at the foot of the bed started to happen. [breathes spookily] "María, give me back the guts you took from me!" [they laugh] That scared you, didn't it? Tell me another story. One more, then. Which? - The one with the shepherd and the ogre? - [Mama] No... Or the devil with the three heads? As legend has it... there exists a beast more evil than any other. - A different story, please, Salvador. - [he grunts] [Salvador] There exists a beast more evil than any other that roams the world and prays on people who are the most vulnerable. Salvador... You know better than to interrupt me. It stands tall, with a face framed by hollow cheekbones... and no eyes fill the sockets on his face. But that doesn't matter, and it stares right through you. When the beast finds a victim, it follows it around, slowly. As the more you fear the beast, the more it sucks you in. [soft ominous music plays] Do you understand this? It is made stronger by the weakness in you. It's a lie, some people say, but I know it isn't. [ominous music slowly grows louder] - My beloved sister... - Salvador, please. No, not now. [Diego] Papa, did she see it? That's enough, I said! Enough for you. Come on, time for bed. Come now, to bed. [Diego] I want to know. [Mama] Some stories you shouldn't hear before you go to sleep. [wind howls eerily] [rumbling] [high-pitched, harsh scream] [cockerel crows] [wind blows fiercely] [water lapping gently] [wind howls] [Diego] Papa! Papa! [soft ominous music grows] [water lapping gently] [boat creaks] Get back to the house. [boat creaking] [boat creaking] Diego, go home! [Diego breathes heavily] [Salvador groans] [dramatic drumbeat] [heavy breathing] What happened? He ran out of bullets. [they breathe heavily] [retching] - Take the boy away! - [Mama] What are you going to do? Try to heal his wounds. Salvador, please be careful. What was he fleeing for? Come on. Come on, come on, my love. [gasping] - [Diego] Will he be coming here? - [Mama] Of course he won't. Was it other men who did that to him? Yes. Do you know why? Because there are only bad people out there, people who hurt others. [Salvador grunts] [soft ominous music plays] [sighs] [wind blows] - [Mama] Shall we sing? - [Diego] Fine. ♪ Marlborough has left for the war ♪ ♪ Mironton, mironton, mirontaine... ♪ Come on, sing along.

[ominous music grows] [ominous music intensifies] - [gunshot] - [she yells] - [high-pitched ringing] - [she gasps] [ominous music intensifies] [music stops] [Mama breathes heavily] [loud thud] What are you gonna do with the corpse? Well? Are you going to bury it here? [she breathes heavily] You should put him in the boat and let it continue downstream. That's what you should do. I don't want that monster on my land, do you hear? [she breathes heavily] Is that his family? - They'll wonder where he's gone. - Go to your room, Diego! [wind howls] [wind howls] [Salvador] Don't touch that. [Salvador sighs] [footsteps approach] What happened to her? Your grandparents... spent their lives treating my sister... so very badly. So badly. My sister and I would spend the nights telling each other scary tales, and listening to those stories would make us feel a little braver. One night, she said, "Salvador." "Sometimes I see the beast here." [Salvador breathes deeply] "In my memory, it looked far away." "However, as each day passes, it gets a little bit closer." "This moment, it's waiting out there," she said. I went to the window, but there was nothing out there. So I went back to my bed. But Juana... muttered, "Salvador... you may not be able to see it." "The beast is there." A few days later, she came running to my bed, crying and wailing. And she said, "Salvador, the beast has just climbed through the window and it's behind the wardrobe. Please, will you help to protect me?" "Let me get in with you. I can barely breathe." "Nonsense, you're pathetic!" "Go to your own bed and let me sleep." When I woke up, I saw that Juana was staring blindly out the window... but towards the horizon. And then she jumped out. Did you see the beast, then? And did the man in the boat see it today? As soon as the beast is seen... all of your life that remains is hopeless. [soft ominous music plays] [wind howls] [Mama] ...dangerous. Do you want to end up being killed? Do you want to end up being killed? [Salvador] I must take him back to his family. Make up another excuse, but don't you dare lie to me! [Diego] Where are you going? [she sighs] Papa? What are you doing, Papa? His wife and his son must be looking for him. Parting to the outlands? Papa, it's too dangerous for you. [Salvador] I'll be fine. You can't go on your own. There's only bad people beyond our land, Papa. They'll kill you. Salvador... [she breathes heavily] We'll be here for you, I promise you this. We'll be waiting for you, you hear? If I can't find them after a couple of days, well... - Take him inside. - Salvador... Take him inside! It's all right. We'll be fine, my love. You'll be with me. [Salvador grunts] [Mama] It's all right. It'll be fine. That's it, that's it. That's it, that's it. It's all right. [horse whinnies] It's all right, my love. He'll be fine, calm down. That's it. Diego! Diego! Papa! Papa! [melancholic music plays] [melancholic music continues] Take care of your mother, you hear me? Take care of her. [melancholic music intensifies] [music fades] - [wind blows] - [insects chirping] [wind blows] [Mama and Diego singing] ♪ Mr Federico killed his wife ♪ ♪ He made mincemeat of her When he took her life ♪ ♪ Put her in the frying pan And turned up the heat ♪ ♪ People passing by Could smell roast meat ♪ [Diego sighs] [Diego sighs] What's wrong, little one? - Do you need to go to the outhouse? - Hmm. You do? You and me. [door creaks] [wind howls menacingly] [wind grows louder] [wind howling] [Diego gasps] [she laughs] Don't make me laugh or I'll miss the pot. [rattling] [musical box plays soft tune] [grunting] [musical box continues] [thunderclap] - We'll begin counting now. - Okay. [both] One, two... three... four, five... Si... See? It's moving further away.

Come on! [musical box continues] [panting] [sighs] [Diego] No, he's not angry with us. It's just outside our land, they're bad. And he's fighting them all of them. Once he has killed the bad people, he will come back. Now we must take care of Mama, all right? We just have to wait. You can do that, can't you? Be patient for one more day, please. Just one day more. [fly buzzing] [Diego] Just one day more... and he'll be back Just a little longer. Just one more day. One day more. Only one day more. [she sighs] Birthday kisses. [she sighs] I don't remember. - [she sighs] - Is it time to get up? Let me sleep, little one. [she sighs] [she sighs] [spits] [Diego] Make a wish. It will come true, I'm sure. Thank you, little one. [metal rattling] - Shall we play? - I'd rather not do it today, no. Please, Mama. [metal cup rattles] [wind howls] You go first! [Mama] I don't feel like it. Oh, of course, because you're going to lose, as usual! [Mama whispers] I spy... What do you see? [Mama] A little something. And the colour is? And the colour is? Mama! - [Mama] Diego, get in the house! - What? Get inside! Go on, move quickly! [she breathes heavily] What's there? [Mama] I don't know. [she breathes heavily] Let's go. Back inside. [ominous music plays] Behind me. Good boy, inside. [girl whispers] Diego. [ominous drumbeat] [whispering] Have you seen the beast yet? [door creaks] [burst of ominous music] [eerie music plays] [ominous music intensifies] - [music fades] - [wind howls] [high-pitched scream] It's coming. [thunderclap] [thunderclap] What are you doing? [thunderclap] [rain hitting roof] Did you hear that? - What? - There it is again. Fetch your shotgun. Fetch your shotgun, Diego! - [wind roars] - Diego! Fetch your shotgun! Give me the shotgun! Give it to me! - What if it's Papa? - No, it's not Papa. [Diego] Is it Papa? Do you see it? There on the horizon, hiding behind the scarecrow. - [Diego] Who is it? - I don't know. It's still there. It's still there! [gunshot] Hurry! Go and get more bullets! [Mama] Stay inside. - Where are you going, Mama? - Stay inside! Mama! Mama! [wind roars] Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Come back! Mama! - [wind roars] - Mama! Mama, come back! Mama! Mama!

[kisses] It's over, come on. - It's over. - [Diego sobs] [she sighs] [Diego trembles] - [heavy rain pours] - [thunderclap] [thunder rumbles] [she hums "Marlborough Has Left for the War"] [scrubbing] - [she breathes heavily] - Mama, could you help me? [she groans] - Where are you going? - To the coop. No, you remain inside. Diego! I'm in charge in the house. I'm talking to you! Mama, may I have permission to go to the coop? No. [he huffs] Wait there. - [ominous music] - [Diego gasps] [Diego breathes heavily] [heavy thud] [Mama] The storm must have blown it up to the door. [bucket rattles] [soft melancholic music plays] It's destroyed. Come on. [melancholic music fades] What's the matter? - [rabbit hisses] - Ah! Bull, what was that for? That isn't true. What do you mean? [wind blows] [Diego] He'll be back soon. Select one of them. - No, Mama, I won't do it. - I don't want to, but we have no choice. - No way. - Diego, do you want us to starve to death? If you don't select one of them... - I will. - [Diego] I'll choose it! [Diego breathes rapidly] Bull. - [Mama grunts] - [rabbit squeals] [Mama] Diego, help me! Please! Diego, help me! Please! [rabbit squeals] - [thud] - [rabbit squeals] Diego, please eat. [she sighs] [she inhales deeply, exhales] [Mama] Diego, where are you going? Diego! I said you have to ask for permission to go out! I'm your mother and you must obey me! [wind blows] [she breathes heavily] I understand that you're very angry. But there's work to do, and you have to eat properly. [loud wind fades into silence] [she breathes shakily] Stand still. Don't move, you hear me? It's there. It's there. [clothes whooshing] [clothes whooshing] Mama! [breathing rapidly] Mama!

[gunshot] [high-pitched menacing music plays] [clothes whooshing] [whooshing fades] - Get away from here! - [gunshot] Leave us alone! [gunshot] What happened? - What was it, Mama? - I don't know. It... I guess it was hidden over there, behind the... the bushes. It must have got closer than yesterday, then. Yes, it was much closer. Because the beast did the same with Papa's sister. Those are just stories. The beast doesn't exist. - Juana jumped out... - She was sick in the head because she was beaten by her parents until all hope was lost, that's why she jumped! [wind howls] [ominous music intensifies] [soft ominous music plays] Get off. Come on. ♪ Mr Federico... ♪ I don't feel like singing, Diego.

Did you see it? - Mama... - It was beside that. Just by there. Right there at the door, about to enter. At point-blank range I shot it, yet it stood there, not moving. It was tall. So tall and hollow. And its body, its hands, its eyes... [she sobs] [Diego] Papa's bags! He ran out of bullets. He won't be coming back. Mama, we have to help him. He's not coming back! You understand? He's not coming back! [metal banging] No respite, otherwise it will kill us. I'm not letting it get in here.

You have to kill it quickly. You stick the knife all the way in. Twist it and pull it out. If you're not sure it's definitely dead, you cut the jugular. Understand? I'd prefer to shoot. Mind these bullets because they're the only two we have left. Come on, up. You have to show me. Diego, you'd better do it. That's an order! Come on. Come on. [Diego sighs] Take hold of the knife.

Here... here... here... and here. Is that clear enough? [Diego breathes shakily] [Diego sighs] [wind howls] [Diego] Don't be afraid of her, Lion. She's just afraid. No! Mama wants to protect us. [Diego] You see? There's nothing out there. You know nothing. Be patient, Lion. Everything will pass. If we just take care of her, she'll be fine. [soft ominous music plays] [Diego] We just have to hold on one more day. [water drips] [Diego] Just one more day. [groans] - [ominous drumbeat] - [Mama] Do you hear it? He's howling. [howling] [howling grows stronger] [bang] [floorboard creaks] Come here. Come! I can hear footsteps there on the roof. It's our opportunity. It won't suspect it. - Take the shotgun and go up there. - No! Climb up the chimney, I'm too big. Come on, I'm too big! No! Your father would do it. So, go on. Fire well. Come on now. - [wind blows] - [soft ominous music plays] [Mama] Hurry. Push your way up!

Shall we see who can last the longest underwater? Huh? - I'm too cold for that. - You have the first go. Come on, don't be silly. Do your best, will you? Come on.
