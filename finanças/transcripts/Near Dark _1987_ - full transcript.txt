You'll be fine. What'll we do now? [Chuckles] Anything we want... To the end of time. But you have to learn to kill. I don't wanna kill. You wanna die? Mae, I ain't no killer. Well, just don't think of it as killing. Don't think at all. Just use your instinct. It's just something that you do night after night. It's only ever a question of how. Instinct. Instinct. Evenin'! [both] Evenin'. Whoo! HAHA! It would be my pleasure and honor to invite you two lovely ladies for a drink. All right. All right. Good! It's making me shaky. That's because you have to. Kill. Some, that's right. The night has its price. Where are we, Diamondback? What road is this? You got me. Isn't that where I had the flat tire? You pulled over. And there you stood by the side of that road. And I just knew you were trouble. And you were right. [Both chuckling] How many years ago was that? Just remember, hon.

Okay, now this is the most important thing when you wanna brake a truck. You got to remember you got two brakes. And one brake is for the cab. This one over here. And the other one is for the trailer. This one right here. When you want to brake the truck, you gotta brake the trailer first. [Air hissing] Come on, baby. Then, you got to brake your cab. [Air hissing] Or else. Or else what? Or else you jackknife. The trailer hits the cab, no more truck. No more truck, no more truck driver. [Laughs] Hey, uh, you okay? You got a problem, kid?

Cop said he was goin' home? Well, you checked the house? He should have been there by now. No, I'm in Waco, Texas. I guess I'm headin' in the wrong direction. Think I'll turn around and head north. Real brave boy. Jesse, he needs more time. Please. Look, one more night. One more night. Then I'm gonna get my wet dream, boy! Why wait? We're gonna do it anyway. He ain't one of us. You don't belong. Besides, you're so damn ugly. It makes my gums ache. I wonder about you, Mae. I should be wondering about you. It ain't right for Mae to be carrying you, Caleb. He makes a kill tonight! I don't care how you do it. You do it, or you're done. And done means dead without guile. It means you be real uncomfortable... For a long, long time. That's your mama talkin', boy. [Train whistle blowing, distant] [Rock on jukebox] Well, I'll be goddamned. Shit-kicker heaven. Hey, come on, Caleb.

Why not, Severen? It almost feels like you're one of us now. Yeah, it does. So what does that make me? I ain't exactly sure. It's good, right? I guess so, yeah. Do you miss the sun? It's been so long, I can't really remember. How long? Spring. Four years back. And I was in high school. Homer said he was in fifth grade and he needed help with his homework. Little weasel. Do you miss he day? The day? Nah. I can see better at night. [rock on radio] [Bullets clattering on table] Here we go. I don't want this. Three cards. How many you want, little boner?

I tried callin' you. We've been out a lot... ...drivin' in the truck. Tryin' to track you down. Dad. Son. Son. Son? Son? [Severen chuckles] 'Round and 'round and 'round she goes. And where she stops, nobody knows. It's about time for that big old wheel to stop rotatin'. Who are these people? I'm with them now. Jesse, you let them go. It's my family. Go on, now. You comin'? [Father] Caleb. No. But you're goin'. No! No! She's mine. You're gonna have to give her back, son. She's not yours. I'm gonna nip her. You can't do that. I chewed Mae. She went off and chewed on you. Now I'm chewing our little sister. That makes us even-steven. You let her go or I'm gonna have to hurt your body, Homer. - You're gonna have to hurt my body first. - Hold on a second, pilgrim. Remember which side of the bread your butter's on. Goddamn, this is my family! Let 'em go! The question is whether they'd let us go. They've been trackin' us. Now they know our faces. I say kill 'em. I've had about enough of this shit. Let go of my boy. And you, let go. Of my little girl. Daddy, put that away. Ain't gonna do no good. What do you mean? It ain't gonna do no good? I'd listen to your son. I'd stop right there If I was you, mister. Not likely. [Gunshot] For you. [Yelling] [Groans] [All screaming] Shit! [Jesse shouting, indistinct] Go on, daddy! Go! What the goddamn hell's goin' on, son? I can't expect you to believe it. I can't believe it myself. I ain't a person anymore. I don't know what I am. I'm sick! We're gonna get you to the hospital right away. You do and I'm dead! No! Caleb... ...those people back there, they wasn't normal. Normal folks, they don't spit out bullets when you shoot 'em. No. [Groans] I got bit. I got a bite. We're gonna get you to the hospital right away. No! Goddamn, you want me killed? I ain't goin' to the goddamn hospital! Hospitals fix this? [Hizzing] [Yelling] Damn it, daddy, Take me home! Daddy? Daddy? You ever... ...you ever transfuse a person? [Groaning] [Sobbing] Daddy? I'm all right. Oh, god, honey. Whoo! You okay? Yeah, I am. Sarah, I'll tell you about it one day. Just promise you won't ask me about it till then. All right? Okay. Wanna go ride a horse? Okay, let's go! Knock it off. It's gettin' cold. You can almost feel the fall comin' on. Yeah, the days are gettin' shorter. Nights are gettin' longer. I'm tired. You pick your dishes up and I'll be upstairs to read to you. I want Caleb to read to me. Go on upstairs. I'll be up in a minute. Hey, don't forget to brush your teeth. - Ey... - You know... Look, I... [swing squeaking] I'm gonna go out and oil that swing. That can wait. I can use the air. Hi, Caleb. Why did you leave? You're warm. Your skin's warm. I belong here, Mae. This is my family. I miss you. What's it gonna be? Mae! [Thunder rumbling] Sarah! Shit! [Thunderclap] Son of a bitch! [Thunder continues] [Horse whinnies] [whinnying] [Grunts] [Hoofbeats departing] I'd sell him. Goddamn. Where's my sister, Severen? Hey, let me give you a hand there, old buddy. Asshole. Hey, Caleb! I hate to be an Indian giver. I really do. But you disappointed me. And now you're gonna have to pay.
