(Noisy electronic accent) (static crackling) (crickets chirping) (camera clicking) - I'm Bailey Rhodes, founder, co-owner, and course instructor at the Rhodes School of Wilderness Survival in Montana. We are now taking bookings for the June to August term of three-day and seven-day courses. These cover everything that you will need to know to prevail in a potentially deadly lost-in-the-wilderness scenario. From creating fire, building shelter, obtaining food, and dealing with medical emergencies, I will show you exactly the skills that you should have before adventuring on an extended trip into the great outdoors. So call us today, toll free, on 555-SUR-VIVE to guarantee your place, but hurry, course positions are limited and have been known to sell-out quickly due to popularity. If you're a hiker, a backpacker, or someone who just plain loves nature, you need this course. Do not go into the wilderness without it, so call us today, toll free, on 555-SUR-VIVE. We're waiting to prepare you for your next great wilderness adventure. (Flies buzzing) There, that's enough of that crap. (Dramatic and ominous electronic music) This is Lolo National Forest in western Montana. It occupies an area of approximately two million acres. That's about 5,000 square miles of rough and unforgivable terrain. It's a spectacular and beautiful place, for sure. That beauty can be deceptive and it hides a harsh truth. It's easy to lose your way around here and with a healthy population of brown and black bears, moose, wolves, coyotes, and even mountain lions, it's definitely not the type of place that you wanna develop a confused sense of direction. (Dramatic and ominous electronic music) I've come into this region here today with just my pack, two cameras, and a tripod to show you what to do if you ever find yourself in a situation where you strayed off the beaten track. I'm gonna demonstrate exactly what it takes to endure in a harsh environment such as this until such time that you can facilitate your rescue or find your own way out, whichever comes first. Now, I may be an expert in all things outdoors, but for the next three days, I'm gonna take on the role of the lost hiker. Yeah, print that! It can happen to the best of us. One minute you know exactly where you are and where you're going, and the next, you're in a world of fear. You're afraid, you're disoriented, panic is setting in. Rule number one, stay calm. Rule number two, stay alert. Try to find either a high point on your topography where you can survey your immediate area, or attempt to locate a river. If you're lucky enough to find one, follow it downriver with the flow. Follow it upriver, and you'll just end up getting even more lost and isolated. All it takes is one slip-up for a bad situation to become a disaster, and out here, you can't afford to be too careless. (Water bubbling) The great thing about being out here in this place is there's no shortage of water. But there are a few tips before obtaining fluid from a river that you will need to consider. Firstly, make sure it's flowing, like this one, and not stagnant. Second, do not take water from the river's edge, as rats and other vermin will often drink from there. The best position is to place your container a few feet out so that it's in the actual flow. (Water gurgling) And thirdly, submerge your container at a specific point in the river where you'll avoid particles and debris that may be on the surface, while at the same time, avoiding silt that may have stirred up from the riverbed. The G-spot, as I like to call it. (Water bubbling) And lastly, boil it if you're still unsure. And on we go. This sign is a little reminder (birds chirping and cawing) of why you always have to be on your guard out here. This is bear country, home to the large grizzly and the smaller black bear. Rangers from the Forest Service put these signs up whenever one's been sighted in the area, and as you can see, this one contains some additional information such as time, day, and date, as it says, "2:30 p.m., May 3rd," which was three days ago. I should be OK, but I can't rest on my laurels. It could still be around, but the secret is to make plenty of noise as you move. Most bear attacks happen because the bears are often caught off guard and taken by surprise, but if you make a commotion while you walk, using heavy footsteps, talking to yourself, and even singing, you should be OK. I'll go into detail about exactly what to do in the event of an actual bear attack later on in this tutorial. It's late in the evening, (crickets chirping) and I've been a lost hiker for the entire day now, and it's been a long and grueling one. I'm tired and I'm hungry, so I must resist the temptation to keep going. I have to stop. Rest and sleep is very important to anyone caught in a survival situation. If you travel at night, you run the risk of becoming even more lost. Bottom line, make camp and bed down for the night. Tomorrow is another day. Yeah, this spot here should do. (Crickets chirping) When you're picking a site for your tent, choose wisely. Watch for loose branches overhead and make sure you're not camping under any unstable trees. Widowmakers, they're called, as they can suddenly come down on top of you in a strong breeze. Also, stay away from rivers that can overflow in heavy rains and dry lake beds that are prone to flash floods. (Crickets chirping) (brush rustling) (heavy thump) What the hell was that? Must've been a moose or something. There's plenty of 'em around here. (Crickets chirping) (tarp rustling) (crickets chirping) Grizzlies have a powerfully-developed sense of smell and can detect food being cooked from over a mile away. As I'll be preparing food later, I'm not gonna be taking any chances. That's where this comes in, my anti-bear electric fence. Now, I know what you're thinking. If I'm a lost hiker, why the fence, right? Well, this is a demonstration video, remember, and I'm not gonna be taking any chances with my personal safety for anything. Obviously, if this was a real survival scenario, I'd be cooking my meals far away from my camp and camp would be, probably way up there, as high up off the forest floor as I could get. As you can see, the fence is now up and running and will give me that extra piece of mind to sleep more soundly tonight. Shit, you know what, it might actually help if I turned the damn thing on. (Grunts) There we go. I know, it looks flimsy. First thing you wonder is, how can something like this keep out a grizzly, right? After all, if they're capable of ripping a car door open, what chance does this have? Well, these fences have proven to be an effective deterrent against black bears and grizzlies. What you have to remember is, bears are very sensitive to electric shocks. Chances are, if one touched his snout off this, he'd gallop a mile away from here and never come back. That's me done for the night. It's time for me to settle into my, yeah, my forest kingdom. (Wolf howling) You hear that? That's something else that reminds you you're out of your comfort zone. The local wildlife, out here, you're back down the bottom of the food chain, but I'm not worried. I've got two effective deterrents, my electric fence and my fire. Fire is the one thing that'll keep predators away. Every animal has an innate fear of it. It seems they have some residual primordial memory of forest fires that have been passed on genetically through the generations, so they'll avoid any fire like plague, which is very reassuring for lost hikers. Though, in Africa, it's use for protection is somewhat controversial, as it has been known to actually attract curious lions. Well, (yawns), that concludes today's tutorial. Hope you can join me tomorrow. Time to settle in for the night. (Fire crackling) (crickets chirping) - [Amber] But I don't get why you have to go all the way out there on your own to do this. Is that not defeating the whole point of having a survival school? - Honey, the school's in the red, and has been for some time now. Not for inclusion in the tutorial. By making this video, I'll be giving them a little taste. It's a form of advertising and self-promotion, and I'll make dollars on sales, too. - [Amber] There'll be no reason for people to attend your school if you're giving all your secrets away in a video. - That's the whole point, baby. A video is just a taster and I'll be emphasizing that. In the end, there is no substitute for actual hands-on experience. I'll be stressing to gain all the knowledge that a person needs, they'll need to sign up. Trust me, they'll get the message. - [Amber] OK, if you say. So, are you OK? - Why wouldn't I be OK? - [Amber] It's just that, you're on your own out there with no weapons of any kind. - I've got my knives, and my tent is surrounded by an electric fence, which is an acknowledged deterrent. - [Amber] It won't be any good if you're attacked by a pack of wolves. - Wolves don't just attack humans and you know that! They'll actually go out of their way to avoid humans if at all possible. And besides, if a ranger finds me carrying a rifle out here without a hunting permit, he'll think I'm out poaching. Look, don't worry, should the shit hit the fan, I've got my cellphone and a solar-powered charger, and as you can see, I'm getting a pretty good signal out here. I'll be OK. - [Amber] OK, darling. You know what you're doing, I guess. You have a good night now, you hear? - Will do, baby, I love you. - [Amber] Love you! - (Sighs) Women. (Insects chirping and buzzing) All you need to make a fire are three things. A spindle, just a long piece of wood, the straighter the better. As you can see, I've sheared it of any bark and jagged edges. A baseboard, I made that small, triangular incision. That's to catch the embers resulting from the friction when the two are rubbed together. And lastly, some tinder to catch the sparks. This technique is called the hand drill method. Experts say when using this particular method, you should go with a hardwood against a soft, but in my experience, that doesn't give superior results. I find softwood against softwood works best. (Flies buzzing) There's more to this particular method to start a fire when you don't have any matches. I go through all of them in detail on my courses. Ideally, you should try to master at least one. That way, you have the confidence in knowing that you don't need any man-made materials to start a fire if faced with a potential life-or-death situation. (Wood scratching and rattling) Woo, no matter how many times I do this, I can tell you it doesn't get any easier. Hands are starting to ache a little bit now. Fingers are gonna be covered in blisters tonight, that's for sure. (Wood scratching) Hoo! (Wood scratching and rattling) (birds chirping) Looks like I've got company. Hey buddy, could you move a few feet either to the left or the right, I'd be much obliged. You see, I'm doin' an instructional video. It's only supposed to be me out here. (Insects chirping) Ooh, now there's two of 'em. Guys, please, I'm trying to shoot something here. I can't do it with both of you standing there, please! I think it's a big enough forest for the three of us. Please, guys, I'm asking, no, I'm requesting, I'm requesting that you please go about your business and let me finish my work here, please! (Flies buzzing) Thank you guys. Thank you so much. Ya'll have a great day now. Well, that was weird, and more than a little bit strange. They had rifles. Probably just some redneck poachers that have never even seen a camera before. I think I've done enough for now, anyway. I'll resume again later on when I know for sure that Don Quixote and Sancho Panza have completely left the area. I know what you're thinking. Why's he all loaded up and on foot all of a sudden? Well, the truth is, rather than wait around to see if my two hick buddies were gonna leave the area, I decided it'd be just as painless for me to move camp, which is what I'm doing. So, I join you now as I trek deeper into Lolo National Forest in an attempt to get as far away from them and any other potential human intruders as possible. At least, it'll give me the privacy to finish what I came here to do. Hey, these things happen. I'd be extremely naive if I thought I wouldn't bump into other hikers or hunters out here. All I can do is be flexible and prepared for the unexpected changes in plan. (Crickets chirping) Are you sure you can pull all this shit together, Todd? I'm serious, there's a lot of stuff here already. - [Todd] Bailey, don't get your panties in a twist. You just keep shooting your material and let me worry about stitching it all together, OK? - But there's a ton of this shit here! - [Todd] How many memory cards we talking about? - Three so far. - [Todd] That's about normal, but just be selective about what you record, OK? There's no point in shooting every piece of bullshit that goes on. - Uh, right. - [Todd] I may be the editor, but you will have to be the editor there, at the location. Just plan what you shoot and think twice before you shoot it. Whatever you do, make sure that you get the footage off the memory cards and onto the hard drive ASAP! - I get you, man. - [Todd] That way, you'll have a clean card to record on each time. - OK. - [Todd] Now, how've things been so far? - Well, with the exception of having to up the sticks and move camp, things couldn't be rosier. - [Todd] What happened? - Ah, just some poachers. You know the story. - [Todd] Tell me about it, hey, best of luck out there. Looking forward to reviewing all the material when you get back. - Thanks, man. Well, you heard 'im, we're officially being retired for the night. (Distant grunting) (sighs) I've just been woken by the sound of some heavy footsteps outside. (Distant grunting) I think it's a grizzly comin' around to inspect my camp. (Distant heavy, punctuated breathing) Man, is he in for a big surprise! (Heavy, guttural growling) (chuckles) Now you can see why I have my electric fence with me. Even though that flimsy little thing was all that stood between me and a 500-pound grizzly, it worked a treat. (Bailey chuckles) Oh, man, that was so fun! (Laughs) Good night. (Birds and insects chirping) It's early morning, I'm awake about five minutes, I come out to take my usual 6:30 a.m. piss, and I get a dawn surprise. I almost stepped in this thing this morning. Normally, no big deal out here where there's lots of wildlife, except, that scat doesn't belong to any animal. I'd say it's human. It seems those assholes from yesterday followed me here and came around last night while I slept. But that's not all. They've been pissing all over the place at this spot here, even on the tent. (Sighs) Smell is pretty bad. (Sighs) I'm guessing it was a reprisal from me asking them to move on and let me finish my work yesterday. It may just be a tasteless one-off joke at my expense, but I'm not moving camp a second time, that's for sure. And, I'm not gonna sit back and wait for the same thing to happen again tonight. So, I'll be taking some steps to monitor their movements. That is, if they come around here again tonight. Chances are, they won't, but either way, I'm gonna be ready. Meanwhile, the show must go on. (Bailey sighs) These are the claw marks of a grizzly, and a large one at that. As you can see, the marks are pretty darn high up there, actually. That would make the height of the bear right about here, roughly nine feet. Now, that's one big son of a bitch, but with proper food resources, they can easily grow that large. Now, what if I was in the situation where that bear, or any bear, came charging at me right now? What would I do, what would you do? Well, firstly, you have to ask yourself, is it of the brown or the black species? Browns are recognizable by the shoulder hump on their back. If it's a brown, chances are it's just defensive posturing. Rolling into the fetal position during the attack might actually save your life. On the other hand, if it's a black, more than likely, it's a predatory assault, meaning getting into a ball will make it that much more easier for him to eat you. And if all else fails, then you, my friend, will have no other option but to fight. There, I'm settin' this hidden camera up on a tripod looking directly at my campsite, just in case those two assholes come snooping around here again tonight. (Insects chirping) - [Amber] Is everything all right up there? - Yes, of course, why wouldn't it be? - [Amber] I'm only asking. - Well, I did have an encounter with a couple redneck poachers yesterday, who then proceeded to take a shit on my doorstep this morning. - [Amber] What, are you sure? - Trust me, it was them. They're the only human contact I've had since I came out here, and the scat outside my door sure as hell wasn't from any animal. It was human. (Distant gunfire crack) What the hell? (Distant gunfire crack) - [Amber] What's going on? (Distant gunfire crack) - Hold on a minute, would you? (Distant gunfire crack) Those redneck assholes, (distant gunfire continues) I had a bad feeling about them earlier and now I can see I was right. - [Amber] What's happening? - Gunshots, either they're hunting game, which is illegal at this time of year, or they're trying to intimidate me. They're even close by despite the fact that I hiked several hours into the heart of the forest just to get away for them. - [Amber] So you think they're following you? - Yeah, yeah, I do. (Distant gunfire continues) - [Amber] What do you want me to do? - Don't do anything. - [Amber] What? Bailey! - I said don't do anything! Leave it to me, I, I'll notify the Forestry Service once I'm done here. In the meantime, there's no point in stirring up a hornet's nest while I'm in these assholes' territory. It's very hard to get some shut eye once you know your personal space has been violated. Forget about the animals, it's the humans I'm more nervous about. I'm trying my best to sleep. I'm constantly waking up upon hearing even the slightest movement. (Fabric rustling) Hello? Is there anybody there? (Crickets chirping) May have only been a possum or raccoon, but might as well have been the devil, because immediately, I'm on edge. Just so damn frustrating. (Crickets chirping) (tripod creaking) (brush rustling) (birds and insects chirping) (zipper buzzing) (birds chirping) What the hell? Must've fallen over last night, or maybe it was something else. Let's see if you captured anything interesting. (Birds chirping) So far, I have to say, it's pretty inconclusive. Something definitely knocked the camera over, sure, but there's no trace of what it was here, and it doesn't seem to have been from any form of human intervention. It may well have either been a strong breeze or a small critter bumping off the tripod, but, either way, at least my redneck pals didn't come around last night. And that in itself is a tremendous relief. (Bees buzzing) Three, two, one. Despite what you may think, food is not your immediate priority in a survival situation. Depending on prevailing environmental conditions, water, shelter, and heat are. The human body can go for a month without food, but would only last three to five days without water, but here's a little tip if you really require that extra little intake of energy. Grass, just pick it from an area where it's unlikely to have been urinated or crapped on by any animals, and pop it in your mouth and chew. Now, notice I said chew, not eat and swallow. Just chewing it to get all that chlorophyll. We don't have the enzymes in our stomachs to break down grass, but the chlorophyll contained within is still extremely good for the human body. (Distant gunshot crack) What the hell, what is it now? (Distant gunshot crack) Goddammit! (Cracking gunfire continues) It's those assholes again! That's the same rifle fire I heard yesterday and it sounds really close. You see, chlorophyll stimulates red blood cells, vastly improving oxygen supply to all cell and body tissues, which in turn has a knock-on effect on the brain, making an individual even more sharp and focused. Just the thing you need in a dire survival situation. (Gun fire crack) Goddammit! (Cracking gunfire continues) Will you give it up, assholes? I'm getting fucking sick of this! (Gun fire cracking) Fuck, (whimpers)! They fired at me! Those motherfuckers actually fired at me! The hell with this, I'm outta here! You hear that, assholes, you win! I'm outta here. It seems I was so focused on being prepared for the indigenous wildlife, I've overlooked something far more hazardous, the human element. This expedition is now officially over. There's two, maybe even three or four pricks out there who like to fire live rounds at people! I'm outta here. It's become way too dangerous. So, here I am, limping home in defeat with my tail between my legs. No, let me rephrase that. In the interest of self-preservation, I'm getting the hell out of Dodge in an attempt to save my ass. It's not worth risking my life over. My intentions for coming out here were simple. Shoot a survival training video and hopefully help my business in the process. Instead, it's turned into a fucking catalog of intimidation thanks to some no-good yokel poachers. The ironic thing is, when I set out here, people were warning me about the animals. Watch for the bears, watch for the wolves, avoid the moose! It's the people that should be carrying a health warning. Heck, I don't even know why I'm still recording this damn thing anymore. Habit, I suppose. It's all I've been doing since I got here. (Footsteps clomping) I've been on my feet for hours now, trying to reconnect with that trail I came in on. Well, I'm having problems finding it. There's no sign of it anywhere. I should've reached it by now. Oh, well, comes with the territory. You're not human if you don't take a wrong turn out here. Time to backtrack. Been backtracking for half an hour now, and still no sign of that damn trail. That's what the woods do to you. If you're not being careful enough, you become disoriented. (Flies buzzing) And I wasn't being careful enough. Fuck! OK, OK, keep on trucking, Bailey. (Laughs) It's even starting to get dark. Whether I like it or not, I'm gonna have to spend the night here. To tell you the truth, I'm exhausted. I couldn't go any further even if I wanted to. (Crickets chirping) - [Todd] What do you mean, it's all over? - I mean it's over, Todd. I'm not about to take a bullet for the sake of a promotional video. - [Todd] Bailey, they were only playing games with you, that's all. You know, these laidback country folk and their weird sense of humor. - You call firing a .22 caliber slug within inches of my face the legacy of a weird sense of humor. - [Todd] You know what I think? I think they're moonshiners. They probably have a still in the area somewhere and don't want you getting too close in case you see their entire operation. The shot was just to scare you off and by the looks of things, it did a damn fine job. - You really believe that? - [Todd] I'm telling you, just don't do anything hasty, OK, Bailey? We've come this far and it'd be a shame to pull the plug now. - I've got Amber on the line, Todd. - [Todd] Just go and rethink about it, OK? - [Amber] Hey, how's it going? - It isn't. - [Amber] What do you mean? - Remember those two hicks I was telling you about? The ones that were bothering me? They took a pot shot at me today. - [Amber] Oh my God! - So come first light, I'm walkin' out of here. - [Amber] Have you been hurt? - No, but it was too close for my liking, and it wasn't any accident, that's for sure. - [Amber] Why would they do something like that? - I suspect it could be territorial behavior. Maybe they feel like I'm trespassing here, I don't know. But they seem to have taken an instant dislike to me from the moment they saw what I was doing here. Maybe I could have handled my encounter with them a little better, but, who gives a shit, I'm outta here tomorrow. I would've been home this evening except I got a bit disoriented and had to backtrack. - [Amber] Disoriented, you? - Hey, it happens! I'll pick up where I left off tomorrow. - [Amber] Will I notify local search and rescue? - Amber, if you do that, so help me God, I will never speak to you again! - [Amber] It was only a suggestion 'cause you said they fired at you. - Don't ever make those kind of suggestions to me, Amber. You know that by now! I can get out on my own steam! I don't need assistance from anyone. - [Amber] OK, I'm sorry. - Look, I'm gonna hit the hay. I wanna get an early start in the morning. I'll see you tomorrow evening sometime. - [Amber] OK, good night, then. (Crickets chirping) - I'm having a little trouble sleeping, again! But as I said before, as long as I'm lying down, getting even a small quota of rest, it'll help me a lot. I'm gonna see if closing my eyes for a little bit will help. Think happy thoughts. Think happy thoughts. (Crickets chirping) (heavy footsteps crunching) (rustling and rumbling) (heavy footsteps crunching) (brush rustling) (heavy footsteps thudding) (footsteps crunching away) (crickets chirping) (rain pattering) I woke to two surprises this morning. Firstly, this heavy downpour. It's been raining like this for hours and now it's too heavy for me to travel in. As I'm not sure of the actual route out of here, I don't wanna risk getting my clothes saturated. Secondly, when I went to bring my camera in out of the rain, I discovered it was gone, and I don't have to guess too hard where it is, either. Clearly, those two inbred poachers have been around here again last night. So what that basically means is, I'm now down to my one and only camera, you. The rain continued for three hours after I made that last clip, can you believe that? Three hours, which is why you find me currently hiking as fast as I can to make up for lost time, but nothing can disguise the fact that I've sacrificed many precious hours this morning. Hours that could have been spent on foot, and I'm still having trouble finding that trail. I just hope I can locate it by nightfall. I'm seeing something up ahead. Looks like some sort of signpost or something. No, that ain't no signpost. I know what this thing is, it's a motion-activated camera trap or trail cam as they're also called. The kind used by conservationists and researchers to monitor animal movements in their natural habitat without direct interference. Whenever something passes in front of it, the infrared beam triggers a shutter release that snaps off a series of photographs. The LED display in the front tells you how many pictures have been taken. So far, this one's been sprung a total of 21 times. I don't know who'd be using one all the way out here or why, but I'm guessing it's the poachers, as hunters all over the world have been known to utilize them to track prey. Which means, I must still be in their general hunting area. Not good news at all. Worse still, I don't remember seeing one of these on my way in here three days ago, so presently, I'm still way off course. (Birds chirping) (shutter snapping) (bag rustling) This old dog's been a walking, walking several hours, and now, he needs some rest. (Birds chirping) Fuck me, I'm gonna be more dehydrated than I thought. That's the trouble with this climate. It's not too warm, it's not too cold. You'd be surprised how much water you lose in a given hour and you wouldn't even know about it. (Cellphone ringing) Oh, great! Hello? (Cellphone beeps) - [Amber] Bailey, how are things? What kind of progress are you making? - If by progress, you're asking have I made it out of the forest yet, then the answer is no, I haven't. If you're asking am I making good time, then the answer is yes, I am. - [Amber] I'm actually starting to get really worried about you. - Why? - [Amber] You're obviously lost, but you refuse to accept it! - I told you already not to mention that word. - [Amber] Well, it's true. Do you think you'll even make it home by this evening? - Not a chance, Amber. - [Amber] Listen to me, Bailey, you really need assistance, whether you wanna hear it or not. - Will you keep you panties on! It was raining from early morning for several hours. That's what held me up and why I'm still here. Only for that, I'd be home by now, jeez! - [Amber] I really think I need to notify search and rescue. - Do not do that, Amber, I told you! I'm just a bit disoriented by the terrain. - [Amber] Disoriented? Don't you mean lost? - What did I tell you already? - [Amber] You could be walking around in circles and you might not even know it. You're in denial, Bailey. - Final warning. - [Amber] Because it's true. You've got 10 years of wilderness experience working against you. You're in a potential life-or-death situation, only you refuse to accept it! Why, because you-- (phone clicks off) - (sighs) That's enough of that, I can't take any more. (Birds chirping) One thing you come to notice about nature when you spend enough time with it is its complacency. Its indifference. It's neither for you nor against you. It doesn't care if you give up or die, or forge on and find a way out. It's just there, watching the proceedings unfold with the calm detachment of a judge awaiting a guilty verdict from the jury before he sends the accused to the hangman. (Birds chirping) Well, this accused ain't goin' to the hangman. This accused is going home. Here I am, still on foot, and still no sign of that trail. Darkness is setting, night can't be too far away, so I'm faced with a dilemma. Do I make camp and spend another goddamn night in this place or keep pushing on till dawn? To hell with it, I'm not stopping. I don't much like the idea of spending another night here. Besides, chances are, if I stay on foot, I'll be out of here by morning anyway. So why bed down and waste whatever time I coulda spent walking? That would be nuts. No, onwards I go. (Crickets chirping) (slow, drudging footsteps crunching) You know, walking at nighttime through dense vegetation is not the most advisable thing to do under any circumstances. It's fraught with danger and the potential for lots of problems, from falling and breaking a limb to getting lost or being pounced on by a predator. If I'm being totally honest, I'm feeling really vulnerable right now. I forgot how intimidating the forest can be at nighttime, especially not when you're in the false security of your tent. It's a calculated risk I'm taking. I don't particularly want to sit on my nuts for another night, which is why I'm feeling better off on foot. On the other hand, there could be things out there right now that are watching me, things that I, myself, can't see. And that idea in itself is really, really frightening. (Footsteps crunching) Hey, I'm actually making good time. I think I'll finally be outta here by morning. (Wood tapping) Did I just hear that? Sounded like someone hitting wood off a tree. (Wood tapping) Why would someone be out here in the middle of the night banging a stick off a tree? (Wood tapping) It could be someone signalling for help. Hello? (Crickets chirping) Well, they've stopped, so, I guess they definitely heard me. Is anybody out there? (Crickets chirping) I'm not getting any further response, so, clearly, they don't need my help. (Wood tapping) It's starting up again. (Wood tapping) You know what, that's not anybody lookin' for help. I'm guessing it's my friends the poachers, playing games with me again. (Wood tapping) They know I'm out here on my own and on foot. They're tryin' to mess with my mind. (Wood tapping) Well, you know what? It ain't working. Let's give 'em a taste of their own medicine. (Stick cracking against tree) (wood tapping) Looks like they're beginning to realize that I'm onto them. (Bailey laughs) (heavy knocks cracking) (wood tapping) Clearly, they're up for it. I have the entire night to hit the beat, but I won't, I've got ground to cover. (Heavy knocks cracking) (wood tapping) (chuckles) So long, assholes. (Knocks cracking) (wood tapping) (footsteps crunching) (wood cracking) What was that? (Tree creaking) Sounded like a tree falling. Who the hell would be all the way out here cutting trees at this time of night? I didn't hear any cutting tools, no, no ax, no, no chainsaw, nothing. I'll push on. (Footsteps crunching) I've been walking along for the last 20 minutes with barely an incident, that is, until a few seconds ago when I heard what sounded like twigs breaking underfoot. I think someone or something is following me. (Branches thumping to ground) That was nearby. (Crickets chirping) Sounded like it came over there on my left somewhere. Over where that came from, I don't think it would be a grizzly. They'd make a helluva lot more noise, that's for sure. This thing, whatever it is, it's much more graceful on its feet. I'm thinking it could be a mountain lion. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! There's something over there behind a tree lookin' at me right now! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! (Bailey breathing frantically) There's no signs of aggression yet, I'm gonna turn the camera slowly so you can take a look. The eyes are set very poor to be a mountain lion, I think it could be a grizzly. If it is, my best bet is to stand my ground and just try to make myself look tall. Oh, fuck! (Guttural growling) It just growled at me, it just fucking growled at me! Oh, OK, OK, buddy. I'm backing away, backing away slowly. Back away, back away. Oh, fuck, fuck! Back away, back away, back away. OK, I'm gonna go on over here. Oh, shit! (Footsteps crunching) So far, so good. Left that grouchy critter way back there. Seems to have left me be. It doesn't appear to have followed me, thank God. (Sighs) Come on, morning, where are you? (Birds chirping) That was the longest night of my entire life. Stopped here around four this morning to rest. Ended up just sitting here (sighs). Didn't move an inch, I didn't sleep a wink either. (Sighs) Dawn couldn't come fast enough. (Bird cawing) As if that wasn't enough, I now find myself in the vicinity of not one, but two of those camera trap things that I saw yesterday. Clearly, there's a lot of hunter activity in this area. Trouble it, I'm not seeing them. Well, I think they sure as hell are seeing me and watching my every move. (Bird squawking) (sighs) Now that daylight is here, I can continue where I left off. Whatever happens, I have to make a concentrated effort to be out of here by sundown. I don't wanna cross paths again with whatever that thing was from last night. Once was more than enough. (Birds chirping) Still on foot, dammit where's that trail? Where the fuck is it, (sighs), tell me! (Chuckling) I must be going out of my mind because for the life of me, I cannot reconnect with that trail. (Footsteps crunching) (birds chirping) (canteen rattling) Great, that's the last of my water. Fucking wonderful. (Birds chirping) (bird cawing) Fuck it, time to man up and swallow your pride, old boy. We've got a bit of a situation here. (Line ringing) Amber? - [Amber] Bailey? - Amber, listen, I'm sorry about my attitude yesterday, about what I said. You were right. As hard as it is for me to say this, (birds cawing) - [Amber] You need help, don't you? - I fucking need help, Amber. You have no idea how much help I need. I'm out of water, I'm totally fucking lost here! I'm wandering around in circles without the slightest idea of where I'm going. I could be five yards or five miles from the nearest hiking trail and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I'm fucked, Amber, you hear me, I'm fucked! - [Amber] Bailey, listen, you gotta be calm, OK? - How can you expect me to be calm? I'm in deep shit. (Birds cawing) The whole trip has turned into a fucking nightmare! Amber, you've gotta get me outta here, I'm not kidding. - [Amber] Listen, you've got to get a grip of yourself, OK? - It's easy for you to say that, Amber, safe, indoors as you are. I'm out here, in this fucking place! - [Amber] Bailey, you've gotta relax. Now is not the time to go to pieces. Find some high ground with no cover and you'll be easy to be seen from the air. I'm notifying the sheriff right now. He'll mobilize search and rescue and they'll find you. - OK. - [Amber] Just get yourself to high ground and light the biggest fire you can. - Yeah, yeah, I'll do that. - [Amber] Just be cool, OK? - Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna be all right. - [Amber] Are you sure? - Goddammit, Amber, I said I'm gonna be OK! - [Amber] Right, then. I'm hanging up now and calling the sheriff. (Phone beeping) (birds chirping) - Whatever anybody tells you about me, self-reliant out here, and not overly dependent on technology, I know for a fact I would be totally screwed if it wasn't for this phone. (Chuckles) Goddammit. (Heavy breathing over crunching footsteps) Another goddamn camera trap setup. Yeah, fuck them and their trail cameras! (Cellphone ringing) Hello? - [Marvin] Is that you, Mr. Rhodes? - Yeah, yeah it is, who's this? - [Marvin] This is Sheriff Marvin Krantz. - Sheriff, thank God! - [Marvin] Are ya injured, son? - No, no I'm not, I just need to get out of this fucking wilderness. - [Marvin] You needn't worry about that. We've a chopper in the air looking for you as we speak and a SAR unit has been mobilized. - Yes! - [Marvin] We'll find ya, son, don't worry. - Please hurry, Sheriff, there's some poachers following my every move. They even fired live rounds at me. - [Marvin] They're not poachers. - How do you know that? - [Marvin] Because we've had complaints about them before. They're a couple of well-funded monster-hunting nuts. Rex and Tex Baxter, two brothers that go around the world chasing myths and legends. They've been claiming for years there's a creature unknown to science in the region you're in right now. My guess is they've been using you as bait, trying to herd you into this alleged creature's territory in an attempt to flush it out so they can photograph it, maybe even capture it. - Well, what you're describing would explain all the camera traps I've been seeing. - [Marvin] We've had claims from hikers and tourists alike about them using intimidation tactics, trying to force people to go deeper into the forest. They're ruthless, totally mercenary. They'll use any means necessary to fulfill their objective. They don't care, my guess is, they've had their eyes on you from the moment you arrived there. - So they've been using me all along, and I've been doing everything that they want. - [Marvin] It would appear so, yes. Having said that, the gunfire is new. I've never heard of them doing that before. My guess is, they're running out of sponsorship, getting desperate, so they'll stop at nothin' until they reach their goal. They'll have a lot of explaining to do once I get my hands on them, that's for sure. It'll be a miracle if they don't end up doing time in the state pen. Just keep your distance from them and hang in there, son. And get your ass to high ground. - Will do, Sheriff, will do. (Birds chirping) Aw, thank God. Well, higher ground we go. Fuck, this is proving more arduous than I thought! Trying to find higher ground is tough when you're stuck in this maze of forest thicket, and everything looks the fucking same. (Phone ringing) Sheriff? - [Marvin] Did you get to some high ground yet? - I'm workin' on it. - [Marvin] Well, you'd wanna work a bit faster. We'll be calling off the search in one hour. - What, one hour? - [Marvin] We're having a lot of trouble triangulating your cellphone signal, we'll resume again at first light. - Well, don't you have thermal cameras and forward-looking infrared for night searches? - [Marvin] Son, this is local, we're on a budget. The search party is comprised mostly of volunteers. They're ordinary citizens like you. I can't have them wandering around out there after dark, and unless you get a good signal fire going, they'll be no point in having a chopper in the air either. - A chopper, I've yet to even hear one! - [Marvin] We have a large area to cover. - But you can't just stop for the entire night. I wanna get the fuck outta here as of this moment, i.e. right fucking now, Sheriff! - [Marvin] OK, tell you what I'll do. I'll give ya an additional hour. - Thank you, Sheriff, thanks. - [Marvin] But I mean it, one hour only, so I suggest you forget about high ground for now and get cracking on a fire, right away. - Getting cracking as I speak. No time to fucking lose. (Wood scraping) I don't know what's happening, but I'm suddenly having a lot of trouble doing this. (Grunts) Aw, fuck this method shit. Why didn't I just bring a box of goddamn matches or a propane lighter? (Wood scraping) (sighs) Been doing this for years. Demonstrated for students numerous times. Numerous fucking times! Now, I can't seem to get a fire going when I need one. Come on, light! (Wood scraping) (gasps) Light, you bastard! Light, goddammit, light! (Wood scraping) Fuck, fuck! I can't do it, I just can't do it. (Birds chirping) What use it is having survival skills that don't work for you when you actually need them? I might as well face it. Unless a miracle happens, I'm gonna be bedding down here again tonight. (Crickets chirping) (cellphone ringing) I couldn't do it, Sheriff. I couldn't get a fire going. - [Marvin] Well, the place is probably still damp from all the rain we had today. - No, that's not it. Face it, I'm losing my nerve. - [Marvin] No. - Yes, that's what it is! - [Marvin] Well, you've been lost out there for a few days now, you've been through a lot. You have to expect a certain amount of mental and physical exhaustion has set in. - Well, I really do need some rest. - [Marvin] Then you do that, retire early and relax. The search resumes at dawn. We should be able to trace your cellphone signal then. - OK, Sheriff. (Crickets chirping) Maybe I'm not cut out for this shit anymore. Maybe it's time I started thinking about a career. Like actually getting one. - [Todd] I hope you're still shooting footage. - Yeah, it's about all I can do up here. - [Todd] That's good, because I got some cool news for you. I told a TV producer about your predicament, and he said he'd be interested in using all the material you shot thus far in a documentary. Is that cool or what? Well, isn't it? Jesus, you're going out of control with your enthusiasm there! - Look, I've got Amber on the other line, Todd. I'll get back to you. (Sighs) Hey, baby. - [Amber] How're you doing up there? - I'm, I'm really pissed off, honey. - [Amber] Be patient! They'll be up there looking for you first thing in the morning. - I know, it's just, Jesus, I was certain I'd be home by now. - [Amber] I know, it's hard on all of us, just hang in there till morning, OK? - I'll sure as hell try. (Sighs) OK, it's almost 3 a.m. I was in an almost coma-like sleep when I was woken by the sounds of objects hitting off the canopy on my tent. I went out and I found these. Someone out there is throwing stones at my tent. See, there it goes again. (Stones thumping) Fuck off, you hear me? I'm not afraid of you! (Stones thunking) Looks like, looks like a black bear. Can't be sure 'cause, it ain't no bear that's been throwing stones. Whatever it was, it seems to have stopped now. I'm gonna try to get some sleep, keyword being try. (Bailey sighs) (footsteps crunching) I managed to get a light sleep, maybe 25 minutes, but I was woke up (heavy footsteps crunching) by the sounds of these footsteps outside. (Heavy breathing and snorting) I don't know what it is that's wandering about out there, but, is it a grizzly? Giant red fence, right about, now. (Heavy breathing and grunting) That ain't no fuckin' grizzly out there. Whatever it is, (heavy breathing and grunting) just stepped right over the goddamn fence as if it wasn't there! Oh, shit! (Heavy footsteps crunching) Oh fuck, it's, (heavy, grunting breaths) it's right outside my fucking tent! Oh, what the fuck is that? What the fuck is that? Fuck, oh, fuck! (Eerie groaning) (heavy, grunting breaths) Oh fuck! (Heavy, grunting breaths) (heavy, grunting breaths) (guttural growling) Oh, fuck! (Heavy, grunting breaths) Oh fuck! (Guttural growling) (gasping) Get the fuck away from me! Get the fuck away from me! Fuck! (Bailey gasping desperately) Shit, oh fuck, shit! (Heavy footsteps thumping) (Bailey breathing heavily) Oh fuck, oh shit, oh shit! (Bailey breathing heavily) Shit! (Wood cracking and creaking) What the hell? (Wood cracking and creaking) Sounds like, (wood cracking and rattling) sounds like trees falling. (Wood cracking and creaking) It's, (whimpers), it's getting louder. That means it's, it's getting closer. (Guttural growling) Oh, shit, shit! (Heavy footsteps thumping) Oh, fuck, oh shit! Oh my God, oh God! (Bailey breathing heavily) Fuck, I've been running solid for an hour non-stop. (Gasping for breath) Hopefully, I left that thing, whatever it was, way back there. I haven't heard a thing since, (gasping for breath) oh God, I need to stop and catch my breath. (Gasping) I don't know what the hell that this was, but I wanna put as much distance between it and me as possible. (Bailey gasping for breath) Why'd I come out here? (Gasping) Why, why? (Wood cracking) What the fuck? (Tree creaking and crashing to the ground) (eerie moaning) (crickets chirping) (eerie moaning) (tree crashing over) (wood cracking) (brush rustling) Ah, fuck! (Eerie moaning) (tree crashing to the ground) Jesus! (Tree thumping to the ground) (Bailey hyperventilating) (brush rustling) (wood cracking) (heavy footsteps thumping) (eerie moaning) Jesus! (Wood cracking) (heavy footsteps thumping) Fucking thing was, though it was tracking me. (Bailey gasping for breath) I, I, I think it's, I think it's, I think it's gone for now. Oh, fuck! (Gasping) Oh, fuck, oh fuck! (Birds chirping) I'm pretty sure this is the way to my campsite. I've been on foot for a while now, so it can't be too much farther ahead. I think I see it just in front of me. (Footsteps crunching) Oh, God, no, no! I don't believe this! It's been thrashed! Everything has been totally thrashed! Fuck! Wait, maybe my phone is still around here somewhere. Aw, fuck it! This is what's left of my phone. Oh, damn. Well, I'm gonna salvage what I can and, and make tracks. There's nothing more I can do here. (Footsteps crunching) Yet another one of those trail cameras. Those Baxter brothers put these things all over the place thinking something is hiding out in these woods. And after my experience last night, now I'm a believer, too. Instead of beating the shit outta this, like I almost did the last one, I'm gonna do what I shoulda done from day one. Luckily my stills camera is one of the few things to survive the thrashing my camp took last night. Their trap triggered six times and I've taken the memory card out of it. Maybe, I'll be able to see exactly what's going on here. (Shutter snapping) (shutter snapping) (shutter snapping) (shutter snapping) (shutter snapping) What the hell is that? (Shutter snapping) I don't know what the hell that thing was. (Shutter snapping) It could be what I saw and heard last night, but it definitely raises more questions than it answers. (Footsteps crunching) Look at this place! (Birds chirping) Aw, fuck! (Crickets chirping) I don't believe this! Trees are leveled everywhere you look! They've been knocked over as if hit by a hurricane! I have no clue what's going on here. (Eerie whistling) There may be something up ahead. (Low rumbling) What, what the hell? Holy shit. (Generator whirring loudly) (generator grinds to a stop) (gasps) No. (Birds chirping) Two packs here. That leaves me in no doubt of who owns this campsite. Those two monster hunters. If they were here when this happened, there's nothing much I can do for 'em. Not much I can use here. Except, however, if it's still working, a fairly average two-way radio. Hello, this is Bailey Rhodes. I'm lost in Lolo National Forest and in need of assistance. Is anyone listening on this frequency? (Radio beeps) Is anyone out there? (Radio beeps) I've gotta get out of here. That thing could still be around. (Footsteps crunching) (radio crackles) Anybody there, over? (Radio beeps) (static crackling on radio) Hello? - [Mysterious Voice On Radio] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Who's this? - [Mysterious Voice On Radio] I'm sorry! - Tell me who you are! (Static crackling) Who are you? - [Mysterious Voice On Radio] They killed him. - What? - [Mysterious Voice On Radio] Help, help, please help! - Are you one of the Baxter brothers? (Static crackling) Where are you? (Static crackling) Tell me where you are! (Static crackling) Hello? Hello! (Static crackling) I don't know what the fuck that was all about. (Footsteps crunching) Never heard back from that person again, whoever he was. Radio's been silent every since. And I don't know where I'm walking anymore. I'm tired, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty, the list goes on. I don't know what I'm doing! Frankly, I don't give a shit. I just don't care anymore! Fuck this, fuck the woods, fuck everything! (Radio crackles) That was not my radio. (Radio crackling) Jesus, it's close by. Hello! (Radio crackling) (radio crackling) (footsteps crunching) What the fuck? (Bailey breathing heavily) (wood thunking) There's that knocking sound again. (Wood thunking) (wood thunking grows more intense) It's, (intense thunking continues) it's all around me! It's fucking everywhere! Shit! (Intense wood knocking) Oh fuck! (Bailey grunts) (breathy snorting) (guttural growling) (brush rustling) (ominous and unsettling electronic music) (shutter snapping) (shutter snapping) (ominous and unsettling electronic music) (pleasant but tinny orchestral music) (heavy footsteps crunching) (guttural growling)
