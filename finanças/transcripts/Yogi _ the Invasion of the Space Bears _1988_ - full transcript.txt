[instrumental music] [tires screeching] Calling, all rangers, this is Ranger Smith. Calling, all rangers. Come in. 'This is Smith. Ranger Smith. Come in.' - Ranger Jones. Here. - 'This is Ranger Smith.' 'Wake up. Wake up!' Uh, Ranger Brown. Alert and ready to roll, sir. All rangers, I repeat, it's Y-B Day. Time to move out. Get ready to roll. Yes, sir, this is Ranger Roubideux. Spinnin' my wheels. On my way! All rangers, assemble at Picnic Rock. This is Y-B Day. So be there. [tires screeching] [instrumental music] Alright, men, look sharp. This is what we've been waiting for. 'The moment we've all been anticipating.' 'The reason we've spent rigorous hours' of intense traing. The cause for which we've sacrificed food and sleep. Y-B Day! And Y-B, alias Yogi Bear will be out there. Using every trick, every disguise every decoy ever thought of by man or beast. But this year we're ready. This is one opening day of Jellystone Park that Yogi Bear is going to get caught barehanded. Or my name isn't Ranger Smith. - 'Ranger Jones, Gate 1.' - Yes, sir. - Ranger Brown, Gate 2. - Yes, sir. The rest of you, you know your posts. So, go, go, go! [engines revving] [coughing] And get that Yogi Bear! [vehicles honking] Say, excuse me but what's the big hold up here? - Yeah, what's the hold up? - We're hungry. Uh, sorry, folks, you're not the only ones. But we're inspecting all picnic baskets. Yes, sir, all picnic baskets. No contamination on your vacation. And as you can see, your cookies are crumbling. Your fudge...needs freezing. A tisket, a tasket, I'll have to take this basket. [laughs] [indistinct arguing] [instrumental music] Here you go, Boo. Another good picnic deed for the day. click click click click Yogi, maybe we shouldn't be greedy. Sorry, Boo, but, uh, I don't believe what you see 'cause I'm a picnic basket napper and I just gotta be me. Oops. Ranger Danger. Time to skidoo, Boo-Boo. [siren wailing] [tires screeching] - Wow! - Did you see that? Are you the folks that had your food inspected? That's right. Did this inspector by any chance have a big nose? - He sure did. - And he wore a fur coat. - He was a fat one. - A double fat one. And he kept saying, "Hey, hey, hey." "Hey, hey, hey," eh? That's Yogi. Yogi Bear and he's in double trouble. [engine revving] This is a hallowed gift you kind souls are making to the starving denizens of these woods. Oh, my. Anything for the hungry, friar. Well, I'm a famished friar, if there ever was one. Uh, I don't know, Yogi. Maybe this isn't right. I'm starting to worry. What could be wrong with a little chocolate chip charity? Oops. Time for some shade, Boo-Boo. [laughs] Hey-hey! It is I, Robin hood. Taking your food to do me good. - What was that, George? - I don't know. Some weirdo. [instrumental music] Alright, men, now hear this. This is war. The park is in the hands of a bear on the tear. When I catch Yogi I'm gonna send him to Siberia. I want you to spread out, cover every trail every path, leave no stone unturned because I want that basket napper if it's the last thing I do! Oh, my. I've never heard the ranger this angry. I better hurry and tell Yogi. Hey, hey, hey, Boo. The Phantom Bear has struck again. Yogi! Yogi! Oh, Yogi, I've come to warn you. I know. Watch the calories. chomp I think that was about 500. Oh, that means everything is in order. Pass the biscuits please, Boo. No. No biscuits, until you listen. The ranger is hopping mad. He said he's gonna send you to Siberia. And he means it. Siberia? Shee.. Doesn't he know I'm a warm weather bear? Yogi, I think we'd better be disappearing bears. Oh, Yogi, you've gotta hide. And right away. muah Eesh. Please. For me. Pretty please. Gee, Cindy, I didn't know you cared. I do, Yogi, very much. Okay, it's back to the cave, Boo-Boo. We'll get a good night's sleep. Then it's off to the deep woods. [indistinct chatter] [engine revving] [tires screeching] Nothing out there. [dramatic music] zap [whirring] [droning] (Yogi) 'Gee, Boob, I was just thinking.' 'Cindy is one swell honey of a bear.' I haven't been so touched since I was a little cub. You were lucky it wasn't the ranger, Yogi. You can say that again, Boo-Boo. No one's as sweet as Cindy. [snoring] [instrumental music] I'm havin' a bad dream. [gulps] Time for a little nightcap. crunch Nothing like a little snacky-poo to chase away the cookie monster. He-he-he-he. [instrumental music] Zor 1, Zor 2, excellent work. These two we have studied 'the ones called Yagi and Boo-oob.' 'They are obviously Earth species of higher intelligence.' And will make perfect protypes for our Daxoid Infiltration Force. Don't you agree? (both) Without a question, oh, wise and knowing Dax Nova. Zor 1, Zor 2, carry on, Phase Two the Daxoid Duplicore Proceedium. As you wish, Dax Nova. Um.. ...but there is one thing you must know. Must know? What? The large one, the one known as Yagi-- He consumes great amounts of food. He could be costly to keep. No cost is too great. 'This Yagi and Boo-oob must be made happy' until our infiltration plan is a success. Bring them here. Then provide them with whatever they need. That is an order. Argh. (both) As you wish, Dax Nova. [instrumental music] swoosh [whirring] buzz [music continues] [chirping] I better check up on Yogi. [instrumental music] Yogi? Boo-Boo? Are you awake? [gasping] I can't believe it. 'Yogi never gets up this early.' [static buzzing] Able 1 to Able 2, are you in position? Ranger Roubideux, where are you? In position and covering the rear, sir. He won't get out this way. Alright, men, we've got Yogi surrounded. Get ready to move in and bag that bear. Oh, my, it looks like the ranger out there. I don't want him to find me here. Oh, let's see, Yogi must have a secret escape. It must be here some place. Oh, it's no use. The ranger will find me for sure. Oh! - What happened? - Gotcha! [mumbling] Calling, Ranger Smith, come in, sir. Ranger Smith here. Go ahead. (Roubideux on radio) 'This is Able Ranger Roubideux, sir.' 'I've captured our pilfering bear.' I bagged this bear makin' a rear exit escape, sir. Top notch work, Roubideux. Open the bag. Cindy! What are you doing here? I just wanted to, t-to talk to Yogi. You mean you came to warn that basket bandit Yogi that we had him surrounded. No. I came to make sure he keeps his promise. What promise was that? Yogi promised to be good. He was gonna turn over a new leaf. The only leaf Yogi would turn over comes in a turkey salad. Although it has been quiet this morning. And there's no sign of him so far. Oh, sir, Yogi promised. I just know he'll come back a changed bear if you just give him a chance. He'd better change. But one thing is for certain. Wherever he is, he is not having any peanut butter and jelly 'or chocolate cake or his favorite Blinky-Winkies.' [snoring] Mmm, yum-yum. Yum, yum, yum. Fe-fi-fo-yum! I smell goodies for my tummy-tum-tum. [instrumental music] (Yogi) 'Hey, Boob, am I dreaming?' Or is that some kind of picnic mirage? It looks real to me, Yogi. You mean real as in, uh, peanut butter and jelly? And for certainly certain as in, chocolate cake? crunch And absolutely authentic as in treato-treats. chomp chomp My all-time favorite dessert, Blinky-Winkies. I wonder where it all came from. From someone familiar with our menu, Boo-Boo. It's all our favorite goodies. You mean, like the ranger, Yogi? Who else? It must be a peace offering. A piece of chocolate cake peace offering. The kind I can't refuse. Hey, hey, hey. crunch - W-what are you gonna do, Yogi? - I'm gonna forgive and forget. Let's go tell the ranger, we accept. 'Mr. Ranger, sir, all is forgiven.' Boo-Boo and I accept your generous-- Greetings, Yagi and Boo-oob. We trust everything meets with your approval. - Yagi? - Boo-oob? Hey, hey, hey. I get it. It's a ranger type trick or treat. 'But it's a little early for Halloween, isn't it, fellas?' Ow-w. Yow! Easy, Zor 1, that must be a form of Earth greeting. (Zor 1) 'Oh, yes, of course.' Ouch, ooch, eech. What kind of a trick was that? Uh, I don't think it's a trick at all, Yogi. Look! (Yogi) 'You're right, Boob, we must be in the Astrodome.' (Zor 1) 'No, Yagi and Boo-oob.' You are our celestial lunar guests. Welcome to the world of the Seventh Sphere. The planet Daxon. (both) Planet Daxon? Oh, I know the ranger wanted to send me away. B-but I didn't think it was out of this world. [instrumental music] Calling all park patrols, this is Ranger Smith. Report in by the numbers. This is Jones here. All quiet at Gate 1. This is Brown at the east end. Everything is a-okay. This is Roubideux from Lookout Point. 'The view is clear. No bears in sight.' Almost a whole day gone by and no sign of Yogi. It seems too good to be true. But maybe it is. [chirping] I really miss Yogi. But I'm glad he's finally staying out of trouble. [engine revving] Afternoon, Cindy. Any sign of you know who? No, Mr. Ranger. No sign of Yogi or Boo-Boo. That's why it's so peaceful. Can you hear the little birds tweeting? [chirping] And the trickle of the brook babbling? We're gonna have a hap-hap-happy spring. Ha-ha. Goodbye, Cindy. [engine revving] Happy for Mr. Ranger maybe but not for me. It's hard to be happy when you're alone.

That's mighty hospitable, ain't it, Boob? plonk [mumbling] Sorry, little buddy, uh, did you say somethin'? I said, it's mighty suspicious. - What is, Boob? - Them. 'Bringing us up here, copying our cave, feeding us.' 'W-why?' Oh, I don't know, Boob. But you know what they say. Huh, what's that, Yogi? Never look a free pizza pie in the eye? Hey, hey, hey. Here you go, fellas, catch. As you can see, we Zors catch on very quick. - Hey, that's not bad. - Now, what Yagi? If you're having fun, repeat after me. - 'Oh, boy, pizza pie!' - "Oh, boy, pizza pie!" What do you say, hey, hey, hey! "What do you say, hey, hey, hey!" My Zors have forgotten their instructions. I must sound recall. Zor 1, Zor 2, if our infiltration of Earth is to be a success, there must be no more of this "Hey, hey, hey." Is that understood? Yes, oh, mighty, omnipotent, Dax Nova. - It is understood. - That is good. Now, this Yagi and Boo-oob, are they satisfied? 'Do they have everything they need?' As you will see, Dax Nova, they're quite content. (Yogi) 'Yum, yum, yummy.' 'It looks like a gaggle of gooseberry tarts.' Mm, this fudge forest cake is delicious, Yogi. And these mini meringue pies are out of this world. chomp chomp [sighs] You know, Boob this Daxon is my kinda planet. (Boo Boo) 'Mine too, Yogi.' Now, care for some butter-scotch, bana cream pie? Need you ask, little buddy? chomp chomp This bear has just begun to bite. Hey, hey, hey. This Yagi does nothing but eat and eat. We must begin phase two. Bring Yagi and Boo-oob to the Duplitorium at once. As you wish, Dax Nova. It shall be done immediately. [instrumental music] How about this, Boob? We're two bears in a bubble. I liked it better in our cave. Relax, little buddy we're probably just going out for a little ice cream. Right, fellas? If that is your wish, Yagi. You know what I say, hey, hey, hey! (in unison) "Hey, hey, hey!" [Zors laughing] [music continues] - Oh-oh.. - Whoa-whoa! [spaceship droning] - Hey! - Hey! Uh, Yogi, are you sure we're going for ice cream? Hey, little Zor pals, are we headed for one scoop or two? Uh, what is scoop, Yagi? You know, uh, like in a double vanilla raspberry and peach or maybe even a triple ginger toffee you know what I mean? No, Yagi, you will have to ask our leader. Did you hear that, Boob? We're going to see the boss. I don't like it, Yogi. What's not to like, little buddy? Them. [music continues] [zapping] Ah, Yagi and Boo-oob. Good of you to come. Good of you to have us, sir. You must be the boss of this outfit? If you mean grand, omnipotent, omnifarious ruler that is correct. Have you been enjoying your stay with us? Best restaurant in the universe [slurp] Oh, omnipity-dipity, sir. Excellent. We have prepared a special surprise for you. Surprise? For us, sir? Just for you. [zapping] [whirring] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] I've looked and looked but I can't find any sign of Yogi or Boo Boo. Not even a trace. Oh, something's not right. I just know he's in trouble. [music continues] [hooting] Mr. Owl, have you seen Yogi or Boo Boo? No. No. No. There's only one thing left to do. I've got to go see Mountain Bear. [gasping] This could be my last hope. Mountain Bear knows everything that goes on in these woods. Oh. 'Oh!' thud thud thud thud Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, don't worry, Mr. Owl. I'm not giving up. You never get anywhere if you do. [instrumental music] I've got to get to Mountain Bear. If he doesn't know where Yogi and Boo Boo are then I'll really start to worry. [wolves howling] There it is. Mountain Bear's cave. [wolves howling] [gasping] Listen to those wolves. They scare me. [Mountain Bear growling] Oh, my, listen to that. It's worse than the wolves. [growling] Yoo-hoo? Mr. Mountain Bear? (Mountain Bear) 'Yeah..' [growling] Is that you, Mr. Mountain Bear? [Mountain Bear growling] Oh, oh, he sounds so angry. I think I made him mad. [growling] I'm the maddest and baddest and wildest bear in these here woods. You're Mountain Bear? But you're so little. Ah, maybe a little on the pant size but I'm a lip starting caterwauling, mountain bear and I lick my weight in grizzlies. Arr. Yes. I bet you can. And I'll tell you what else. These here are my deep woods. That there is my cave. And you're a-trespassing. I'm-m s-sorry, M-Mountain Bear I-I didn't mean to disturb you. But-but I had to find out if you knew where Yogi is. Yogi? What kind of Yogi? Our kind of Yogi. A bear just like you and me. You mean the sneakiest, trickiest, fast talking little cub I ever knew? That Yogi? - Yes and Boo Boo too. - Boo Boo? That cute little fella who's always worrying? Yes. That Boo Boo. Well, then, who are you? I'm Cindy Bear. Cindy Bear? Ha ha ha! The little tyke who is always in love with Yogi? That's me and I still am. But I can't find him and that's why I've come. You're my last hope, Mountain Bear. Have you seen Yogi or Boo Boo? No. Can't say if I have. I just don't know. I've looked high. I've looked low. I've done everything but find Yogi. [instrumental music] Say, big dipper, uh, what was that inner tubulation if I might ask? We were merely preserving your image for the Daxonion museum. You mean like a hero-type statue, sir? Well, uh, you could say that, Yagi. Hey, hey, hey. You got any more surprises like that, Mr. Omnidipity? Uh, it's coming right up. Or should I say down? [zapping] [whirring] (in unison) Surprise! Uh-oh, Yogi, do you see what I see? I see you and me. That's what I see. Remarkable. A perfect likeness. Don't you agree? Yes, Dax Nova. Remarkable. A perfect likeness. Hey, what's going on here? "Hey, what's going on here?" Did you hear what I heard, Boob? "Did you hear what I heard, Boob?" I don't like the way this looks, Yogi. "I don't like the way this looks, Yogi." And I sure don't like the way it sounds. "And I sure don't like the way it sounds." [growling] Perfect! The Duplicore process is a total cosmic success. - Yes. A cosmic success. - Perfect. Not only do they look alike, they speak alike. Not if I have anything to say. "Not if I have anything to say." Hey, hey, hey, don't say what I say. "Hey, hey, hey, don't say what I say." That is enough...for now! [zapping] That is more than enough, big dipity. Oh, I hope you don't have any more surprises like them. 'They give me the copycat creeps.' Just one more surprise. You see now that we have your exact duploids you're no longer needed. [laughing] Goodbye, Yagi and Boo-oob. [zapping] [both screaming] [laughing] [both screaming] Gosh, Yogi, what's happening? Easy, Boob. [whirring] [zapping] [both screaming] Oh, I can't believe it, Boob. (Boo Boo) 'Uh, we've been set adrift.' swoosh (Boo Boo) Oh. What're we gonna do, Yogi? We're spinning in sp-space. (Yogi) I don't know, Boob. We're two bears in a bubble. And we're in bubble trouble. [instrumental music] Boy, oh, boy, is this the life, Roubideux? I mean, carefree, bear-free. [chuckles] What more can I ask for? Except, uh.. A-a little to the left with that umbrella, please. You got it, sir. This is one rest you deserve. A whole summer with no pesty picnic-pilfering bear. And I won't mention that bear's moniker. Absolutely not, sir. Don't spoil the mood. slurp A little spritz if you don't mind, Roubideux. (Roubideux) Comin' up, sir. (Ranger Smith) 'Not only do I not have to see, you-know-who' 'for the whole summer' I don't even have to hear his name. (Cindy) 'Oh, Yogi, Yogi and Boo Boo.' 'Has anyone seen Yogi?' I don't believe it. I can't even relax for two seconds without hearing Yogi. It's always Yogi. (Cindy) 'I'm sorry, Mr. Ranger 'but I can't find Yogi anywhere.' And what's wrong with that? Well, I thought that because you were so mad maybe you really did send him to Siberia. No such luck. Yogi has just disappeared and I'm not complaing. We're leaving well enough alone. But, Mr. Ranger, but what if Yogi or Boo Boo are hurt? Or even worse, what if they're starving somewhere? Yogi? Starving? That's a good one isn't it, Roubideux? [both laughing] Yes, sir, a good one indeed. [laughing continues] Well, I don't think it's so funny. Look, Cindy, I've known Yogi for a long time and I can assure you that wherever Yogi is he is just floating along 'taking life one minute at a time' without the slightest care in this world. Y-Yogi, this looks like the end. Not so fast, little buddy. As long as there's a bubble in the sky never say die! (Dax Nova) 'Well, it appears our Earth friends' are in their orbit pattern as planned. (Zor 2) 'That is correct, Dax Nova.' It is time to proceed with the Duplicore process. [zapping] [whirring] It's working. It's working! Look at my cosmic creations. They're a supernatural sensation! (all in unison) "Look at my cosmic creation. They're a supernatural sensation." Silence! Save that noise for Earth. [dramatic music] Zor 1, Zor 2, prepare your craft! It is time for the first Daxoid infiltration wave to depart. Duploid Yagis, duploid Boo-oobs, ready to depart? (Duploids in unison) Yes, sir. Up, up and away. Ready to go, sir. Hey-hey hey! They are prepared. Then let us embark for Earth. - Hey, hey, hey? - "Hey, hey, hey." - Hey, hey, hey. - Hey, hey, hey. [both chuckling] [instrumental music] Controls on. Monitors functioning. (Zor 1) 'Monitors are functioning.' Setting operational countdown time for three Daxoid cycles. (Zor 2) 'When the last cycle begins' 'we shall send the duploids into the woods.' Cock-a-doodle-do! [snoring] Cock-a-doodle-do! (Zor 1) 'The time has come for duploid deployment.' Oh, the first wave is underway. (Zor 1) 'Huh. This is a historical moment, Zor 2.' (Zor 2) 'Yes, the future of Daxon depends on them.' 'Hey, hey, hey!' [bird chirping] [yawns] Mm. It's such a beautiful day. I just wish Yogi and Boo Boo were here to enjoy it with me. Every day, I miss them more and more. [bird whistling] You miss them, too? I guess all the animals do. [chirping] 'The woods just aren't the same without them.' [whistling] You're right, cheer up. They'll be back before I can even say, "Hello, Yogi." Hello, Yogi. "Hello, Yogi." Yogi, Yogi, you're back. I can't believe it. screech I'm so happy to see you. "I can't believe it. I'm so happy to see you." If he's so happy to see me, why is he walking away? I've been so worried, please don't ignore me. "I've been so worried, please don't ignore me." Who's ignoring who? I stay awake worrying and he just keeps on going. screech Now, listen, if you found another friend you better just tell me and I don't mean Boo Boo. "Now, listen, if you found another friend '"you better just tell me' 'and I don't mean Boo Boo."' Oh, never mind. I don't even wanna talk to you. It seems to be going well. Now, we will activate speech alternators for the duploids. Of all the nerve, I worry myself sick and Yogi makes fun of me. Hey, hey, hey. Don't you hey-hey me. You can't treat me like this. Treat you like what, Cindy? What is wrong with hey, hey, hey? I've never been so humiliated. And to think I loved Yogi.. That deep woods Casanova. And little Boo Boo too. - 'Here we are!' - 'Here we are!' "Yogi the deep woods Casanova." "And little Boo Boo, too." Oh, how could you two be so mean? I never wanna see either of you again. (in unison) "Oh, how could you two be so.." Here, I've been pining long enough. Now, it's your turn. (Zor 1) 'It appears we can add pine cone crunchies to the duploid menu.' Yes and the speech alternators are working perfectly. (Zor 1) It is time for the duploids to mingle with the populous. We will activate the integrating function modulators and then report the results to the omnipotent one, Dax Nova. But first, a brief operations test. The woods are full of fun. The day has just begun. You go your way. Whatever you say. And I'll go hee, hee, hee. And I just gotta be me. All systems are go. The duploids are now infiltrating. [instrumental music] croak croak Oh, picnics are so much fun don't you think so? Oh, yeah and I'm starving. [chuckles] I made a great fig tuna for you and a jelly sandwich for me. Oh, boy, great. Let's eat. Mm. What's that? [gasps] It can't be! I don't know but [gasps] it looks like Yogi and Boo Boo! Oh, you'll love this. I bought pickles and onions and banas and for dessert, a chocolate cream pie. Uh-oh, it looks like we got company. [gasps] Oh, no! Bears, wild bears! - 'What do we do?' - 'Don't move.' Hey, if we sit still, maybe they won't bother us. (in unison) Ho-ho, hey, hey. It's a beautiful day. It's time for our lunch. Oh, crunch-ety crunch. plop plop And for dessert, here's a chocolate squirt. [both groaning] (in unison) 'Heidi-heidi-ho! Back to the woods we go!' No, no! I can't believe it. 'I don't believe it!' Oh, dear, did I say picnics were fun? The nerve of those bears! How dare they? Yeah, it's them alright. Hello, Ranger tower to Ranger Smith. Come in, sir. 'Come in, please.' 'Ranger Smith?' Are you there, sir? Are you there?' [yawns] I'm here. What is it? It's Yogi and Boo Boo, sir. I've spotted them in the west park. Hm, is that so? Well, yeah, I must be dreaming, goodnight. [snoring] Oh, boy, I wanna ride a scooter. I wanna ride a scooter! Okay, mister, that'll be five bucks for an hour. Oh, this one, this one, this one I wanna ride this one. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! Anything to make you happy, kid. Let me start it up. [engine sputters] Hmm, what's wrong here? Come on, mister, I wanna go for a ride. You mean a scooter-rooter ride like this? Hit it, Yogi Bear! [engine revving] Hey, hold it, you two! Hold it! Come back here with that scooter! 'Come back here!' There goes my ride! There goes my ride! Over hill, over dale. We're gonna hit the happy trail. Yeaow! I'll catch you, scooter-stealers! Yeaow-whoa-ow-ow! - First, we zig to the left. - Then zag to the right. And for our tree-top tour, hang on tight. You bears are gonna pay for this. And you're gonna pay dearly. Nothin' like a view from the trees. Hey, hey, hey. Come back here! (Yogi) 'Going up.' (male #1) 'Stop!' vroom vroom vroom vroom vroom vroom - Ground floor. - This is where we get off. screech But you're not getting away. Checkpoint Charlie ahead. I-is that who I think it is? [both scream] Hey, Boo Boo Bear, where did you go? Right behind you, Yogi Bear. Just leave the driving to me. Halt! No bears allowed on.. ...s-scooters! Follow those bears! Callin' Ranger Smith, callin' Ran.. [snoring] This is Ranger Smith, go ahead. Well, you're not gonna believe this, sir. But I'm trailing Yogi and Boo Boo in the east park. Huh? Uh, what, east park? They sure get around. [chuckles] What a silly dream. [snoring] Now, to start the motor you just pull the rope like this. [chuckles] Like I said, just give it a yank. Three's the lucky charm. Excuse me, sir, but I believe this is how it is done. [engine revving] vroom Hey, that's my dinghy! [groans] Hey-hey, Boo Boo Bear. Ho-ho, Yogi Bear. Faster! splash What a quiet, peaceful day. With Yogi gone, I can fish in peace and I've got a feeling I'm gonna catch a big one. 'Yeah, I'm really gonna get it today!' There she blows. [chuckles] I got a bite! (Yogi) That makes two of us. Hey, that's my fish and that's Yogi. Yogi? He's back! Uh-oh, trouble ahead. (Yogi) I better make a collision decision. Let's hang-a-hang-a left. Right. Whatever you say. crash Yogi Bear, where are you? Over here, Boo Boo Bear. Hurry, I have not been programmed to swim. I am coming. Here is a line. 'Nice catch, Yogi Bear. Hang on!' H-e-l-p! Very good, Yogi Bear! Yeaow! All ashore! Yeaow! [screaming continues] [screaming continues] [screaming continues] Hey! (Ranger Smith) 'Help!' [Yogi screaming] (Ranger Smith) 'H-e-l-p!' thud 'Help!' [groans] If this is a dream it's the worst nightmare I ever had. [drum roll] Men, it's a sad day in Jellystone when picnic-ers are no longer safe and your own chief winds up in a trash can. What were you all doing? Taking naps? Excuse me, sir, but I called you at 01:00 hours. I called at 02:00 hours. And I called at 03:00 hours. Are you trying to say I was asleep on the job? (all in unison) Oh, no, sir. Not you, sir. [clears throat] That's better. Now, what I want is Yogi. Pronto, quick! On the double! Bring him in! (in unison) 'Yes, sir!' [engines revving] [coughing] Oh, my, it sounds like Yogi is back and it sounds like he's in trouble. I knew it was too good to last. I knew Yogi would come back and ruin my summer. Here they are, sir I brought 'em in as ordered. Well, Yogi and Boo Boo, you summer-spoilers. What do you have to say? It's a beautiful picnic day. Everything's going our way. Oh, it is, is it? Well, your way is to Siberia. See if you can have a picnic there. - Lock 'em up. - Yes, sir. That's what I call nervy bears. Yogi and Boo Boo ruin a picnic and come in here smiling. Ranger 2 reportin', sir. I captured the scooter-stealers. What? But they were ju.. I was just.. Oh, never mind. Add jailbreak into the list and lock 'em up again. - Heidi-heidi-ho. - What a way to go. You're not going, you're gone. Put 'em away! Aye-aye, sir. This time Yogi's gone too far. Pilfering picnic baskets, stealing scooters, jailbreaking. Oh, Ranger Smith, sir.. There's something you should know, sir. Not now, I'm so mad I could swear I'm seeing double. Here they are, sir. I caught 'em red-handed hijacking a dinghy. They're out again and they hijacked a dinghy? Oh, that's good for a 100 years on the woodpile. Any last words, you two escape artists? Anchors away! Hey, hey, hey. That does it! This time I'm locking you bad-news bears up myself. And I'm locking you up for good. And I'm throwing away the key. - Roubideux. - Yes, sir. Take this key, do anything you want, but get rid of it! Yes, sir. Now, even if I wanted I couldn't let Yogi out. [laughing] [laughing] (in unison) Hey, hey, hey, whatever you say. (in unison) Hey, hey, hey, we're with you all the way. Yogi and Boo Boo in triplicate? I must be hallucinating. Roubideux, bring back that key. Roubideux! Help! Yogi, I think we're stuck in space forever. You're tellin' me, little buddy. At the rate we're moving we won't see a blue moon until June. Yogi, look. What's all that stuff? It ain't green cheese. It looks like junk to me, Boob. Now we know where everybody dumps their garbage. Gee, Yogi, with all that trash there won't be a clean space left in space. You're right, Boob but it's given me an idea. What, Yogi? Arms out, Boob, and grab an oar. - Get it? - Got it. - Now what? - Now, we row for home. - Ready? - Ready, Yogi. Then away we go.

Hi, Boo Boo, buddy. Are you okay down there? I'm hanging on, Yogi. How about you? Nothin' to it, little buddy. It's just like fallin' out of bed. Yeah, but wh-what's gonna happen next? Nothing, Boob, we're just floating in space. [conveyor belt rattling] screech We are sorry to report, oh, great omnipotent one. But the duploids on Earth have been captured. Then we must proceed with the second invasion force immediately. 'As you can see, the duploids are being prepared' 'and the real Yagi and Boo-oob are floating in space.' Floating in space? They've broken orbit. (Zor 1) 'This is a catastrophe, oh, great omnipotent one.' (Zor 2) 'Yagi and Boo-oob will soon be over the city.' Captain of the guard Yagi and Boo-oob have escaped. Send out Dax patrols immediately. They must be found. As you command, great omnipotent leader. [dramatic music] [spaceship droning] swoosh Oh, no, Boo Boo buddy where'd you go? Tell me you're not gone, please. (Boo Boo) 'I'm not gone, Yogi.' Is that you, Boob? Where are you? (Boo Boo) 'It's me, Yogi' 'I'm up above.' Oh, little Boo Boo, you're in heaven. (Boo Boo) 'Not yet, Yogi.' I'm on top of the bubble. How'd you get up there, Boob? It must've been the comet. (Yogi) 'Then you better hang on, 'cause here comets another.' swoosh Hey, Boob, I'm about spun out. How about you? Down and out is more like it, Yogi. Look! Oh, what do we do? Hold your nose and say some prayers.. ...that when we land, we're okay bears! [glass shattering] - 'Are you okay, Boo Boo?' - 'A-okay, Yogi.' - 'Where are we?' - 'I don't know, Boob.' 'Let's sneak a peek.' [Yogi gasps] (Yogi) Do you see what I see? (Boo Boo) I hope not. 'Who are they?' (Yogi) 'Uh, I don't know, Boob.' 'But maybe if we close our eyes, they'll go away.' (Yogi) It's awful quiet out there, Boob. (Boo Boo) You think those weirdos are gone, Yogi? So, two more of Dax Nova's infiltrators, hey? Hey, Dax Packers, look at that fat, silly disguise. [all laughing] Fat? I beg your pardon, little lady but what you see is the original me. And who are you? I'm Yogi and this is my little buddy, Boo Boo. - Boo Boo? - Yes, what's your name? - I'm Snulu. - Snulu. - Boo Boo. - 'Snulu.' (Snulu) 'Boo Boo.' Yoo-hoo.

We ask the questions and you give us the answers. boing boing boing - Yeah, who are you? - Where are you from? - 'Come on, let's hear it.' - 'Yeah.' [indistinct clamoring] Shall we tell them, Boob?

Full steam ahead, Yogi. All rockets go! [whirring] In the name of our imperial leader I order you to duck! After those spacey bears! [instrumental music] I-I'm not sure I know how to fly this thing. You better do something, Yogi. And fast, here comes the Dax patrol. Hang on, everybody. Here goes. [droning] [all screaming] 'Great balls of moonbeams!' So, Yagi is going to make a chase of it? Very well, the chase is on! (Yogi) How do I stop this thing? I've heard of sky high but this has gone far enough. 'Oh-oh, what goes up must come down.' (Snulu) 'There goes the Dax patrol!' And here comes the ground. 'Do something, Yogi!' (Yogi) Eenie meenie.. Uh, I'll try this one. 'Hey, hey, hey, it worked.' 'Dax City or bust.' 'Here we come!' Yagi is some space skimmer. But they're not getting away from me. swoosh Yagi is clever but he will not escape my Dax Fighters. As you say, Dax Nova. No way. Look at this. I'm flying by the heels of my little bear feet. Hey, hey, hey! You're doin' great, Yogi. Just don't let up on the power. There's a Dax skimmer behind us and they're coming on fast. Hey, hey, hey, where Yogi flies, nobody goes. And if we wanna go faster, I just wiggle my toes. [rumbling] [all screaming] (Snulu) 'Oh! Oh, what happened, Boo Boo?' I think Yogi wiggled one toe too many. Don't worry, little buddies, you know what they say about bears who fly upside down? No, Yogi, what do they say? (Yogi) 'May the fur be with you.' swoosh Yagi is headed for the Duplitorium. 'After him!' swoosh (Dax Nova) 'How can this be?' 'Yagi's outsmarting my best sky skimmers.' As we knew, oh, mighty omnipotent, Dax Nova. Yagi is of higher intelligence. - Hey, hey, hey! - What was that? Uh, uh, if-if-if I may say uh, Yagi is on his way. [instrumental music] - 'He wouldn't.' - 'He shouldn't.' swoosh - Yagi's done it. - Yagi's done it. Greetings, your big dippity sir. Greetings? You'll pay for this, Yagi. I order you to land at once! Yes, sir. Just watch out for the loopity-loops. swoosh [Dax Nova screaming] Yagi, I command you to hold up. Did you say up, big dippity? As in zoopity-zoop? (Dax Nova) 'Help!' 'Put me down.' (Yogi) I believe this is the landing gear, omnipity sir. [Dax Nova screaming] I don't think big dippity is gonna like being ejected, Yogi. (Snulu) 'You can say that again.' 'He's gonna be one mad Dax.' Sorry, little buddies, but what can I say? Uh, except I hope big dippity likes it up on the Milky Way. Hey, hey, hey. [spaceship droning] Yabba-dabba-do and a diggity-diggity-boo. (all) 'Whoa!' Hang on, bear buddies. - Wow-wee! - Wow-wee! Did we lose those bad Dax skimeroos? No way. Dax bandits at 10:00 o'clock. (Boo Boo) 'Time for us to get lost, Yogi.' 'Dax Nova is coming back.' (Yogi) I hear you, Boob, loud and clearly. Let's leave these Dax bandits in their own space dust. - Roger-dodger. - Over and out. swoosh Yagi is escaping to the city. Don't let him get away! (Zor 3) 'As you command, great omnipotent one.' 'Full power on.' swoosh swoosh (Zor 1) 'The second duploid invasion force' must secure Park Jellystone, Zor 2. No problem, Zor 1. With my activator we will have total control. (in unison) Total control. (in unison) Hey, hey, hey! [laughing] [engine sputtering] (Yogi) 'Uh-oh. What now?' Gosh! I think we need new batteries. Comin' up, Boob. Look, Yogi, up ahead. (Yogi) 'I see it.' Hold on. Yogi the Red Baron is comin' in for a real deadstick landin'. crash [Boo Boo sighs] 'We made it, Yogi.' Just by a few fingers, Boob. Sheesh, Boob, look at all of us. Why are they making copycats out of us bears, Yogi? Those are Dax Nova's duploids. Created to rule the universe. The universe? I'd have settled for a picnic table and a couple of Jellystone donuts. slurp Ready for voice resonator testing, Zor 1? Ready, Zor 2. Try this first three levels. Right. Ready for level one. (all in unison) Hey, hey, hey. Ready for level two. (all in unison) Hey, hey, hey. And the final level three. (all in unison) Hey, hey, hey. Sheesh. Do we sound like that, Boob? If we do, I wish they'd send us away. [gasps] Look. Greetings, oh, mighty omnipotent one. We are making preparations for the final invasion. The prisoners Yagi and Boo-oob have escaped. But who needs them when we have an army of perfect duploids? True. Zor 1 and Zor 2. 'You will return to Earth with a new invasion force' 'for operation total take-over.' This sounds serious, Boob. We gotta lower the total on the take over. Right, Yogi. We better get back and warn Mr. Ranger. (Yogi) 'Aba-solutely and it looks like' 'that is our ride back to Jellystone.' Yeah, Jellystone. And you can come with us, Snulu. Oh, Boo Boo, how sweet. You'll love it there, Snulu. There's birds and trees and a snuggly cave and there's plenty of snick-snacks to eat. 'Yogi's always stealing.' I beg your pardon. I mean, finding lots of extra goodies for us. We have donuts and pies and cookies and cakes. Oh, Boo Boo, it sounds wonderful. You're my shing star and I'll always shine for you. But I can't go. I have to stay here and help fight that tyrant Dax Nova. You mean, like a good soldier? Yes, the Dax Pack will need me. 'And it looks like Jellystone is going to need you.' You're right, Snulu. But maybe one day.. When the fight is over.. (in unison) We'll be together again. Excuse me, but I believe we have a plane to catch. And I've got a plan. This is what we do. [whispering] Hey, good idea. Are there any final orders, oh, grand omnipotent, Dax Nova? Yes, we shall all recite the Daxoid pledge together for a successful crushing of our resistance. [laughing] Yeah. I like that crushing stuff. Good. Now, ready to recite? (in unison) Ready, oh, grand omnipotent, Dax Nova. (all in unison) Jupiter, Venus, Earth and Mars one by one they'll all be ours. Saturn, Pluto and the moon. We won't be stopped. We'll take them soon. Daxoid stars and planet stations we'll make them all one constellation. Hey, Dax dummies, you won't take us. Not in a thousand light years. It's Yagi and Boo-oob. The Earthlings have joined the Dax Pack. Get them! [spaceship droning] Good luck, Snulu. Did you say something, Zor 2? No, Zor 1, I thought it was you. We'd better have a look. Zor 1, I don't see anything, do you? Nothing, Zor 2. A-a-ah-ah.. It's all clear, Zor 2. Ready for loading. I'm activating duploids, Zor 1. swoosh That was some decoy job, Boob. You know your little Snulu is one great gal. She sure is, Yogi. I just hope that she is okay down there. Don't worry, Boo Boo buddy. I got a feeling your little Snulu is a big match for anybody. [spaceship droning] Come on, Dax Nova, what's holdin' you up? Your starched cape? [laughing] Faster. First we'll catch that leader of the Dax Pack. Then, I'll teach Yagi and Boo-oob the consequences of defying the omnipotent, Dax Nova. Ah, they're still on my tail. Hold on, you hard copies. (in unison) "Hold on, you hard copies." (Snulu) 'We're going under easy.' (duploids) '"We're going under easy."' swoosh Shall we follow, oh, grand omnipotent, Dax Nova? [babbling] (Snulu) 'Whoa!' 'Ha-ha! So long, look-alikes.' (duploids) '"So long, look-alikes."' (Snulu) This is where you get off. 'Whoa!' Oh, grand omnipotent one, where are you? crash [babbling] Did we make it? Yes, oh, mighty omnipotent one. Where are Yagi and Boo-oob? Look, there are the two nincompoops. (duploids) "Look, there are the two nincompoops." Nincompoop, eh? Do you know the penalty for consorting with the enemy? "Nincompoop, eh? Do you know the penalty for consorting with the enemy?" I am the enemy and I'll ask the questions. "I am the enemy and I'll ask the questions." Oh, you dare to make fun of the omnipotent one? "Oh, you dare to make fun of the omnipotent one?" That does it! Captain, press the ejection button. - But, sir.. - Do as I command! Press the ejection button. As you command, oh, great omnipotent one. [chuckles] So long. Not ag-ain! (duploids) '"Heh heh heh. So long."' Yippee! It looks like Dax Nova is out for a spin 'and the Dax Pack is in.' 'Ya-hoo!' [squeaking] vroom Hang on, Cindy. For goodness sakes, what's the emergency? It's terrible, it's scary. It's absolutely the worst. screech (Cindy) Are you talking about your driving? No. Ranger Smith. I've never seen anything like it. - What's wrong? - He's in a state of shock. - Shock? - Yeah, Yogi shock. 'This way, that way. What am I gonna do?' Whoa! I'm afraid to look. clank You haven't seen anything yet. What are you talking about? Yogis and Boo Boos. A bunch of them. Three pairs. Three pairs? That's not possible. Oh, yeah? Ranger Smith has 'em locked in a cell. But if we don't get there fast, he's gonna scream. So am I. Watch out! I don't know how much more I can take. Yogis to the left, Boo Boos to the right. Three pairs of bears is more than one ranger can handle. Are we here to stay or are we on our way? (in unison) Hey, hey, hey, hey. (in unison) Let's be on our way. Nothing could be sweeter than to play follow the leader. Hup, hup, hopitty-hopitty-hup. Three Yogis? And three Boo Boos? Huh. It just can't be. I must be hallucinating. Maybe I should pinch myself and maybe it'll go away. Ouch! That hurt. It's okay, Mr. Ranger, here we are. Everything is gonna be alright. Cindy's here. 'Did you hear me, Mr. Ranger, sir?' Cindy is here. Yoo-hoo, Mr. Ranger. It's me, Cindy Bear. Huh, what? A-another bear? Oh, no. No more please. No more bears. But, sir, you said you wanted to see Cindy. Oh, oh, yes, Cindy. Oh, thank heavens you're here. You're the only one who can help me. Of course, Mr. Ranger. What can I do? I've got a cabin full of Yogis and Boo Boos and you're the only one who can tell me which is the real Yogi. I'll try, sir, but these days I don't even know myself. Okay, Cindy, tell these wise guys the joke is over and for the real Yogi to come out. What wise guys, sir? (Ranger Smith) 'The bears are gone.' There's no Yogi, sir. What do you mean there's no Yogi? There's three of them. And they're gone? What? Where'd they go? Uh, this place was crawling with bears. Oh, there, there, Mr. Ranger. Everything will be okay. You-you just need a little fresh air. Take a nice deep breath. You were probably just having a nightmare. But I saw them. [inhales deeply] It was like a bad dream. Ah! That's it, Cindy. A nightmare in the daytime. Yeah. [laughing] You're absolutely right. It was all a bad dream. Yipee! I'm free. 'Free! Free!' 'It was just a nightmare.' 'It never happened.' Oh, thank you, birds. Thank you, trees. No more bears. I'm free, free, free. I was just dreaming. I don't know. There's something strange going on. I can feel it. And there's only one bear who knows for sure. Who's that? Mountain Bear. And it's time I paid him another visit. swoosh There it is, Boob. Jellystone. Yeah, Yogi, we're almost home. (Zor 1) 'Zor 1, reporting in to Dax Leader.' Jellaistoone operation is on schedule. All duploids ready for invasion. Zor 1 and Zor 2 signing off. Over and out. Gosh, Yogi, what are we gonna do? Don't worry, Boob. I'm thinking and blinking. I just hope I can think and blink fast enough 'in time to warn Mr. Ranger and save Jellystone.' Now what's the trouble this time, Cindy? It's Yogi, Mr. Mountain Bear. [laughing] You mean picnic-picking Yogi has disappeared again? Yogi and Boo Boo. Either they're gone. Or people are seeing triple. [sighs] Oh, I'm so worried and confused. [sobbing] Now, now, Cindy. Old Mountain Bear ain't lived this long without learning an old trick or two. So you just hold those tears. 'I'm gonna fire up some deep wood magic' 'just for you.' Oh, thank you, Mr. Mountain Bear. ♪ Mumba-mumba humba-jumba ♪ ♪ Homba-humba vumba-mumba ♪ [drum roll] How does that sound, Cindy? To be honest, Mr. Mountain Bear.. [chuckles] ...it sounds silly. Silly? You ain't heard nothing yet. Wait till I get warmed up. 'That was to get me in the mood.' Whatever mood it takes, Mr. Mountain Bear as long as it brings Yogi back. ♪ Mumba-mumba humba-dumba ♪ Oh! ♪ Mumba-dumba humba-mumba ♪ (Cindy) Oh! ♪ Mumba-mumba dumba ♪ Mr. Mountain Bear, are you sure this is gonna work? Well, of course I'm sure. Now, stand back. ♪ Mumba-dumba dumba-mumba ♪ That oughta do it. Whee! [laughing] Let's eat. - What's that? - Marshmallows. They taste great roasted over a hot fire. But what about Yogi? There ain't enough marshmallows. But we've got to find him. - Who? - Yogi. Oh, yeah, I forgot. chomp chomp chomp Yeah. Ye-wa-ha! Mighty good, mighty good. Now, where was I? You were gonna find Yogi. Please. 'And no more dancing.' Okay, okay. Yogi Bear, where have you gone? Are you in the north heavens? 'Are you in the deep south?' 'If you can tell us, open your mouth.' 'If silence is what you do best' 'give us a sign from east to west.' [rattling] He's not on Earth, not any place. To find Yogi Bear look towards spa-a-ce. "Look towards space?" What does that mean? I don't know. I never felt anything like that before. A mistake to be eatin' marshmallows. That's it for tonight. No more. [grunts] Are you in the north heavens or in the deep south? If you can tell us, open your mouth. [sighing] The only thing Yogi would open his mouth for is a chocolate cake. If only I could figure out Mountain Bear's riddle. I'll give it one more try. If silence is what you do best give us a sign from east to west. He's not on Earth, not any place to find Yogi Bear look towards space. thud Oh, it's just no use. I guess I'm just never gonna see Yogi or Boo Boo again. [buzzing] Ready to launch duploid invasion, Zor 2? Ready. beep beep beep [instrumental music] Invasion underway. (Zor 1) 'Jellaistoone will soon be ours.' Did-did-did I say I'd never see Yogi and Boo Boo again? I-I must be having a d-daytime nightmare of my own. Quick, left turn, hop. I know I wish to see Yogi and Boo Boo again but not like that. (Yogi) 'Gee. Did you really make a wish to see me, Cindy?' - 'I'm touched.' - 'Me too, Yogi.' [gasping] Who said that? It's us. Your wish come true. Yogi Bear and his little buddy, Boo Boo. Now, just a minute. How do I know it's really you? I just saw a hundred Yogis march by. Well, how about a little quickie quiz? That oughta do it. Okay. What's Yogi's favorite thing? A pic-a-nic basket, a ringa-ding-ding. And what does he like best in a basket? [slurp] Mmm. A yummy chocolate chip cookie, what else? Yes. A kissidy-kiss. Mwah. Yuck! What was that? That was the real Yogi. He can't stand to be kissed. [instrumental music] [feet stomping] [rumbling] Oh, no, it's them again. [rumbling] This is one nightmare that won't go away. Duploids taking over Jellystone? Invading bears from space? Can you believe such a thing? I might, but I don't think the Ranger will. But it's my duty as a law-abiding bear to try and warn him. We've gotta tell him before it's too late. But how are we gonna do that? (Yogi) 'Just leave it to us bush-type bears.' 'With trees and vines, we'll sneak through their lines.' 'Hey, hey, hey.' (Ranger Smith) 'I can't believe it. They're like medflies.' 'They're everywhere.' M-maybe if I hibernate, so will they. If I don't see another Yogi until June, it'll be too soon. Oh, boy, look at all of us. (Cindy) 'Poor Mr. Ranger must be havin' a breakdown.' Then there's no more to say except Yogi Bear is here to save the day. [instrumental music] [music continues] thud (Yogi) 'Mr. Ranger, sir. Is that you, sir?' It's me alright. Who's that? It's me, sir, Yogi Bear. Huh, what else is new? I've seen a hundred of you if I've seen any. It really is Yogi, sir. A-and Boo Boo, too. Mr. Ranger, are you cold? Why are you under that blanket? I am hiding from a nightmare. And I'm not coming out until all those bears are gone. 'I don't wanna see another Yogi until next spring.' Next spring may be too late, sir. Those bears you've been seeing are invaders from space. They're here to take over Jellystone. Invading bears from space? [laughing] Oh, no. That's a good one. Oh. That's a big fat one. [laughing] I think the ranger is delirious, Yogi. You said it, Boob. Seriously deliriously. We've gotta do something, Yogi. We have to stop those invading bears from space. "Invading bears from space." She said it again. [laughing] The ranger is cracking up, Yogi. I-I know, Boob. We gotta make a move. And whatever it is, we gotta make it fast. (all in unison) Please feed the bears. Please feed the bears. Please feed the bears. (boy #1) 'Hey, look at all the friendly bears.' - 'Here's a cookie.' - 'One sandwich comin' up.' (boy #2) 'Apples away!' (all in unison) Please feed the bears. gulp gulp gulp I told you we gotta move fast, Boob. Those spacey bears are stealin' our show. And all the goodies too, Yogi. Boy, what a swell bunch of bears. This is gonna be a great picture. Alright, steady everybody. 'Say cheese.' (all in unison) Cheese. Hey, Boob, I think I'm startin' to get the big picture. What is it, Yogi? These duploid bears are gonna smile and say something cheesy 'then take over Jellystone like eggs over easy.' Okay, buddy bears one more picture. 'Say cheese.' (all in unison) Cheese. Marvelous, the duploids are mingling well with the populous. Yes. Things are going exactly as planned. A friendly takeover of Jellaistoone. [instrumental music] - Is this okay, Yogi? - Perfect, Boob. When those show-off type bears hit the ramp 'they're gonna go for a ride they'll never forget.' One jumbo jump coming up. vroom (all in unison) Yippee-dippy-dee! 'Yippee-dippy-dee!' Now, what? crash (all in unison) Ho, ho, ho, away we go! crash splash It can't be. 'A mob of bears' 'and they're all Yogis and Boo Boos.' Those bears are acting crazy. How are we gonna stop them? I've got an idea, Yogi. What is it, little buddy? Well, it goes like this. [whispering] Egad, Zor 2. It appears we have defective duploid deportment. Uh, what does that mean, Zor 1? It means they're makin' unfriendly faces. Uh, perhaps I can re-program them. (Zor 1) 'Look, Zor 2.' (Cindy) 'Help. Help.' Please save me from these monster bears. - Aah-wah-aah-waah. - Aah-waa.. Eh, those two duploids are clearly out of control. Yes, they have gone very much banas. You must stop them. (Zor 2) Uh, I'm trying. - Help. Help. - Ah-wah, ah-wah.. - Mad bear on the loose. Help! - Ah-wah, ah-wah, ah-wah. Oh, it's no use. I can't control them. Zor 1 to Dax Nova. Come in. Emergency! - Help! Help! - Ah-wah, ah-wah, ah-wah. Hurry, Zor 1. The Yagi and Boo-oob duploids have gone berserk. Emergency, Dax Nova. Emergency. Please come in, Big Leader. (Dax Nova on phone) 'This is Dax Nova.' We have an emergency, oh, mighty omnipotent one. 'The Yagi and Boo-oob duploids are out of control.' They're not the only ones. I never wanna see another Yagi or Boo-oob again. (Zor 1) 'Uh, what are your orders, Grand Leader?' Dump those duploids and get me down from here. Do you read? 'Abandon Jellystone Takeover!' 'Get me down!' We read, oh, mighty omnipotent, Dax Nova. Immediate blast off and rescue underway. The invasion is over. We won't be needing this. Yeah, butweneed it. splash - Got it. - Way to go, little buddy. [spaceship droning] Yogi, look! swoosh - Farewell, Yagi. - Farewell, Boo-oob. It's time for us to say.. (in unison) Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! [both laughing] - Ready, Boob? - Ready, Yogi. 'Freeze.' [engine revving] (Yogi) 'Give it to 'em, Boob.' (Boo Boo) 'Freeze.' When, w-when is this nightmare ever gonna end? [babbling] (Boo Boo) 'Freeze.' We stopped the duploids, Yogi. Let's give credit where it's due. The day has been saved by my little bitty buddy, Boo Boo. Boo Boo? Sheesh! Boob's missing in action. Come on, let's go find the little guy. It's getting dark. There he is, Cindy. Shh. Yogi, I think we better wait here.
