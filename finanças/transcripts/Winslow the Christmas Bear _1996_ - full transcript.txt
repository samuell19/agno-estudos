[subtle piano music] [magical sounds] [subtle piano music] - [Narrator] This is the story about Christmas, the most special time of the year, special for everybody in the world, no matter who they are and this story happened one Christmas Eve, a not so very long time ago, far away in the mountains. [upbeat Christmas music] [subtle piano music] Now in this Christmas story, there was a bear, and a raccoon, and a cougar, and wolves, and a linx, and a fox, and a dog, and a little girl. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning. It was a very cold day that day before Christmas. Most of the animals in the forest were busy getting ready for that special day. Some more than others, but this story didn't happen until that night, when a little girl read about it in a magic storybook. The little girl's name was Chrissy, she had just gone to bed on Christmas Eve, but something very special was about to happen to her. That was the Christmas Eve she discovered The Magic Storybook. - [Child] Did you see that? - [Narrator] Well, actually The Magic Storybook discovered her. - [Child] Check that out. - [Child] Hey, it jumped up on the bed. - [Narrator] The little stuffed animals were right, The Magic Storybook jumped right up on the bed and touched Chrissy on the nose. "How very strange" she thought. Well, she just had to read it, wouldn't you? So Chrissy opened the book up and read the first story and the first story was Winslow, The Christmas Bear. It was just as Christmas Eve day was beginning. It was very cold that morning, but the cold wasn't why Winslow the bear wasn't asleep like all the other bears in the forest. Winslow couldn't sleep. He was supposed to be sleeping. That's what bears do in the winter, you know? But Winslow was much too excited to even think about closing his eyes. You see, Winslow is quite different from other bears. Winslow thought about things very carefully and one of the things he thought the most about was Christmas. - [Winslow] I wonder what Christmas is really like. - [Narrator] That's what Winslow asked himself because he really wanted to know. - [Winslow] Well, I can't find out if I'm sleeping. - [Narrator] Of course he was right. He couldn't find out if he was sleeping. So that morning, Winslow had decided to find out what Christmas really was and that's exactly what he did. - [Winslow] My, it's awfully quiet this morning. I haven't seen anybody. Oh, it's Wild Bill the Buffalo. Hey Wild Bill, I want to ask you a question. Oh, the river sure is wide here. How am I going to get across? I need to ask Wild Bill what Christmas is. Oh, it's hard to walk on this long. I can't, whoa, whoa. That water is cold. Wild Bill, it's me Winslow. Oh, wait Wild Bill. Wait, I need to ask you. Please don't go. I need to know what Christmas is. Oh, that water is cold. Oh no, he's gone. Who can I ask now? - [Narrator] Winslow thought about it. What should he do? Who should he ask? - [Winslow] I bet my friend Roger Raccoon would know what Christmas is. I'll go ask him. - [Narrator] And that's exactly what he did. After Winslow had been traveling quite a while, he came upon a fallen tree in the forest and started over it. It was right then that he saw his friend, Roger. Now, Roger a very busy little raccoon. He was gathering food on this cold winter day, busy, busy, busy. - [Winslow] Hi Roger. - [Roger] Hey Winslow, what are you doing up? Bears aren't supposed to be awake during the winter. You're supposed to be in your cave asleep. - [Winslow] I know, but I want to find out what Christmas is. - [Roger] You don't know what Christmas is? How very strange. - [Winslow] That's why I came to visit. I thought that maybe you could tell me. - [Roger] Well, I really don't have a lot of time to talk right now because I'm very busy. See, busy? But if you want to know what I think, I think Christmas is food, good things to eat. Yeah, that's what it is all right, food. - [Narrator] Roger kept gathering up all the small nuts and berries he could find. Winslow thought very hard for a moment about what Roger had said. - [Roger] Look, if you don't believe me, why don't you go ask Frieda the Fox? She's very clever, I bet she could help you. - [Winslow] That's a good idea. - [Roger] But you better be careful Winslow. - [Winslow] Well, why do you say that? - [Roger] Cause the wolf family is out and you don't want to end up being their supper, do you? - [Winslow] No, I guess I don't. Thanks for telling me, Roger. - [Roger] Any time fuzz brain. Don't take any chances. - [Winslow] I'm going to see Frieda. - [Narrator] And that's exactly what he did. Winslow didn't really think about the wolves as he walked away, he was too busy trying to decide what to ask Frieda the Fox. But the wolves were out that Christmas Eve and they were looking for Winslow. Winslow was walking right through the very place where the wolf family lived. Winslow decided he'd better be very careful because he didn't want to end up as dinner for a pack of hungry wolves. Suddenly, there was Frieda the Fox, Winslow's very good friend. - [Frieda] Oh my word, is that Winslow the Bear I see? - [Winslow] It's me. I've come to ask you a very important question. - [Frieda] What important question? - [Winslow] I want to know what Christmas is. Boy, your fur sure is soft. I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong? - [Frieda] You mean to tell me you came all this way from your warm cave to ask me what Christmas is? That's easy, Christmas is having fun. - [Winslow] Having fun, that's what Christmas is? - [Frieda] Sure Winslow. I have the most wonderful time exploring and playing in this thicket. There's so much to do and see. Besides, Christmas is the happiest time of the year. - [Winslow] So Christmas is having fun. Can't you stand still? - [Frieda] Can't, no fun to stand around and having fun is the most important thing. - [Narrator] As soon as she said it, Frieda became a bundle of energy running here and there while poor Winslow could hardly even follow her. He tried to stop her with his paw, but she was much too quick. - [Frieda] I know who else you could ask, Winslow. You could ask cranky old Wilford the Wolverine. - [Winslow] I could, couldn't I? I'll just go ask old Wilford. Thank you, Frieda. - [Frieda] You're welcome. And Winslow? - [Winslow] Yes? - [Frieda] There's one more thing. - [Winslow] What's that, Frieda? - [Frieda] Be very careful. The wolf family's looking for Christmas dinner and you don't want to be the main course, do you? - [Winslow] No, I don't. I'll be careful. - [Frieda] Have a merry Christmas. - [Winslow] Thank you very much. I will, I think. - [Frieda] Winslow is such a funny old bear. I hope he's okay. - [Narrator] Frieda was right. The wolf family was lurking around the forest on that Christmas Eve and they were looking for Winslow. Chrissy put down the book for a moment, concerned. The wolves made her afraid for Winslow. What could he do? She hoped he'd be all right. On his way, Winslow got a little lost so he stopped to ask directions from a fisher. Dolly was in a tree, so Winslow poked his nose right up in the branches. - [Winslow] Hello Dolly. Can you tell me how to get to the meadow? - [Dolly] Sure Winslow, it's that way down in the valley by the big trees. Hey, what are you doing here anyway? - [Winslow] Looking for Wilford. Thank you, Dolly. - [Narrator] Winslow had to travel for a long way because the valley in the mountains was quite large. Sometimes he had to squeeze his big bear body through very small openings, but that didn't stop Winslow because he really wanted to know what Christmas was. As he traveled, as he traveled, he thought to himself that maybe he shouldn't have left his nice warm cave. Just like everybody said, bears weren't supposed to be out on Christmas. Maybe they were right. But then he thought. - [Winslow] Well how will I know if I don't find out? - [Narrator] And so, he kept on going. - [Oliver] Here I go. Gotta get in the water. Ah, the big splash, yeah! Oh yeah, Geronimo! Woo! Great day for a swim. - [Narrator] Winslow was hurrying along when he heard Oliver, the quick little river otter, having the time of his life swimming in the mountain stream. Oliver was one of Winslow's best friends and oh, how Oliver loved to dive and play in the water during the winter because an otter and water just go together, even in a cold winter stream. Winslow was going along as fast as his bear legs could carry him when he finally saw Oliver. - [Oliver] Wee! - [Winslow] There's Oliver now. Hello Oliver. - [Oliver] Hey Winslow, is that you? - [Winslow] Oliver Otter, what are you doing? - [Oliver] Well, I'm not getting dry cleaned. - [Winslow] Oh, isn't that cold? - [Oliver] Otters love water. We have very heavy fur coats and water can't get through. Hey, why aren't you asleep in your cave with your mother? - [Winslow] Oh, I'm asking everyone what Christmas is. - [Oliver] What Christmas is? Christmas is getting everything that's good. Don't you know that, bear brain? - [Winslow] Christmas is all those things? I don't understand. - [Oliver] Christmas is whatever good thing you want it to be. I thought everybody knew that. - [Winslow] Well, I didn't know that. - [Oliver] That's because bears are supposed to be asleep in the winter. Boy, are you slow. Besides, bears aren't meant to celebrate Christmas. - [Winslow] What's so funny? - [Oliver] Oh, the snow tickles my back. Winslow, bears hibernate during the winter, they don't have to worry about Christmas. - [Winslow] I thought Christmas was for everybody. - [Oliver] I don't think Christmas is for bears. In fact, I don't think any bear has even tried to find out. - [Narrator] That was news to Winslow. He didn't want to do anything he shouldn't. - [Winslow] I didn't know I wasn't supposed to. - [Oliver] Hey, where are you going? - [Winslow] Well, I guess I better go back home. - [Oliver] Gee, now that you're here, you might as well go and ask old Wilford, even though he is pretty cranky about these things sometimes. - [Winslow] Oh, that's true. But maybe I'll just ask him, as long as I've come this far. - [Oliver] Good idea, fur face. Take care of yourself and have a merry Christmas Winslow. - [Winslow] Thank you. I will, I hope. - [Narrator] And with that, Oliver plopped into the icy cold water again and swam to the other shore. As Winslow watched Oliver go, he thought about those hungry wolves again and his very big bear heart gave a thump. Oliver hopped out of the water and started scurrying here and there up the hill, in and out. It was Christmas Eve and of course, Oliver had a great many things to do before the big day came. So Winslow the Bear continued his journey on that Christmas Eve day. He was thinking about all the things he'd learned so far. Roger had told him Christmas was about food. Frieda said that Christmas was exploring new things. Oliver told him that Christmas was just what you want to make it. Poor Winslow was so confused. He didn't know what to think. Who was right? Then, just as Winslow was wondering about all those things His friends had told him, he saw old Wilford the Wolverine. He certainly did look cranky, Winslow had to admit. At first, he didn't think he was going to say anything to the cranky old Wilford, but then his curiosity about Christmas got the better of him. - [Winslow] Hello Wilford. - [Wilford] What do you want? Haven't got time to dilly dally with the likes of you. Things to do, places to go. - [Winslow] I'm sorry to bother you. I was just wandering what Christmas was. - [Wilford] That's a pretty silly question, what Christmas is. [mumbling] What do you want to know for anyway? You're a bear, bears don't have Christmas. You're supposed to be asleep during Christmas. - [Winslow] Well, I wasn't very tired. Everybody says Christmas is something different and I was hoping you could tell me. - [Wilford] Don't have time for this. Christmas is a waste of time, that's what it is. - [Winslow] Well there must be something you could tell me. - [Wilford] I could tell you a lot of things, but I don't want to. Not my job to tell every fuzz ball that comes along what Christmas is, not my job. - [Winslow] Well, could you give me a hint? I won't bother you anymore. - [Wilford] Too late, this is all a lot of bother and bladder, bother and bladder, bother and bladder, that's what it is. No time for this. - [Narrator] Said Wilford and he was gone just like that. Winslow just sat there more confused than ever. That didn't sound like the Christmas he'd always heard about. - [Winslow] I'll just go ask someone else then. - [Narrator] He said to himself as he trotted away and that's exactly what he did.

Everyone was interested, but some more than others. The wolf family was also very interested in Winslow's journey. They had been following him the whole time and soon now, they would make their move. Winslow didn't even know they were there as he looked around the valley. Meanwhile, while he was on his way, Winslow ran into someone else quite by accident. It was Larry the Mountain Linx. - [Winslow] Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was just wondering if you could tell me what Christmas is. - [Larry] Oh, hi Winslow. What are you doing up? - [Narrator] He was curious why a bear would be up Christmas Eve. The little linx was one of the most playful and happy friends that Winslow had, always running and climbing and jumping every which way. He made Winslow tired just to watch him. Sometimes he played with his sister, Loretta. Sometimes he just ran around by himself. Finally, he stopped just long enough for Winslow to say something. - [Winslow] Do you know what Christmas is? - [Larry] Sure, Christmas is playing, plain and simple. - [Winslow] Christmas certainly is different for everyone. - [Larry] Of course it is. It's the best time of the year. - [Narrator] Winslow realized that every one of his friends had a very different idea about Christmas, how confusing? He knew less now than he did when he was back in his cave. - [Larry] Aren't you gonna stay? - [Winslow] Can't, I think I'll go ask Mother Cougar. She knows about everything here in the forest. - [Larry] Winslow, you know that the wolves are around, don't you? - [Winslow] Yes, I've heard that. - [Larry] Oh, everybody says they're very hungry. The whole family is running around looking for a big Christmas dinner. - [Winslow] Thanks for telling me. - [Larry] Oh, your very welcome funny old bear. Merry Christmas. - [Narrator] Mother Cougar was a very large mountain lion. She had lived in the forest longer than anyone could remember, including Winslow. She knew everything. While Winslow looked for her, the wolves were getting closer. Now, Mother Cougar liked to perch herself on the very highest peak so that she could watch everything. But Winslow wasn't so sure that he wanted to be up this high. - [Winslow] Whoa, I better be careful. I could fall a very long way, that's real steep. Maybe I'll just go around the easy path and talk to Mother Cougar. - [Mother] Winslow the Bear, I thought it was you. What are you doing way up here? - [Winslow] Climbing. I'm just trying to get up there to talk with you. - [Mother] And what on earth are you doing up in the winter? - [Winslow] There's something I need to ask you. - [Mother] You are supposed to be sleeping, bears hibernate in the winter. - [Winslow] Yes, I know, but I need to ask you something because you're the wisest animal in the forest. What's Christmas? - [Mother] You got up in the middle of winter to ask me that? - [Winslow] Yes I did. Do you know? - [Mother] Well, of course I know. Christmas is singing. The humans call it caroling. I call it noise, but that's what it is, singing. - [Winslow] Singing? - [Mother] Not worth getting up for, was it? Here, I'll show you. ♪ Winslow the Christmas bear ♪ Silly old bear - [Winslow] Like this? - [Narrator] Winslow tried to sing, but he wasn't very good. - [Mother] You call that singing? You sing like a bear. - [Narrator] Winslow knew he sang like a bear. He kinda liked it. - [Mother] And Winslow, one more thing. - [Winslow] I already know, the wolves are out. - [Mother] Correct and they're coming this way. If I were you, I wouldn't be here when they arrive. - [Winslow] That's a very good idea. I'm going now, goodbye. - [Narrator] And Winslow left the mountain top. Mother Cougar stood up on the rock and watched him go, she was worried about the funny old bear. - [Mother] Time for me to go to. Can't leave the children too long, you know? - [Narrator] As she left, the father of the wolf family, Willard, watched her run off. Then he followed. Chrissy was afraid for Winslow. She scrunched up her pillow so it was just right. Then she kept on reading. Now, after Winslow left the mountain top, he went into the valley thicket to see who else he could find to talk to about Christmas. Wait a minute. Someone was in the thicket. Why it's Kenneth, the crafty little coyote. - [Winslow] I'll just say hello. Kenneth, it's me, Winslow. - [Narrator] But Kenneth didn't hear Winslow and off he went every which way, here, there, everywhere. - [Winslow] Hello? It's me. Kenneth, where are you? I can't go very fast, Kenneth. Could you slow down? - [Kenneth] Hey Winslow, you wanna play tag? - [Winslow] Wait Kenneth, I didn't come to play tag. I wanted to ask you something. - [Kenneth] I'm over here buddy, come on. - [Winslow] Wait a minute. Where are you? Kenneth? - [Kenneth] This way, try and catch me. - [Winslow] But I can't go as fast as you. Kenneth? Kenneth, you're a lot faster than me. - [Kenneth] Run again Winslow, over here. - [Winslow] Please slow down. Kenneth, hello? Boy, he's sure fast. - [Narrator] Poor Winslow, every time he got close to the coyote, Kenneth would just zip off in another direction. He just couldn't get that coyote to stop for a minute. Winslow went on searching for the longest time, but he didn't find Kenneth. Just then, Winslow heard the strangest sound. [poking sounds] - [Porky] Oh no, don't eat me, I don't taste good. Please don't eat me. You wouldn't like me. I'm all stringy and tough and icky tasting. Get away, leave me alone! Please let me go. - [Winslow] I'm not going to eat you, slow down, it's okay. - [Porky] You wouldn't like me. Porcupines are real bad nutritionally. I can see it in your eyes, you're gonna, you're gonna gobble me down and spit out the needles. - [Winslow] I'm really not going to eat you, Porky. I just wanted to ask you a question. - [Winslow] Oh, it's you Winslow. Oh man, am I glad it's you. I thought you were one of the wolves, they'd make a sandwich out of me. I'm so glad it's you instead. Don't ever sneak up on me again. You almost gave me a heart attack, you fur covered bee bee brain. - [Winslow] I'm sorry. - [Narrator] Said Winslow, and he was. Winslow decided maybe he'd better not bother the frightened little porcupine anymore. He'd just go ask someone else and that's exactly what he did. Winslow trudged down through the snow covered mountains. While Winslow was asking all his animal friends about Christmas, the day was passing quickly. Winslow was running out of daylight. He had to hurry on his journey if he was going to find out in time. He only had a few hours left and then it would be night and then it would be Christmas day and too late for anyone to tell him, so he kept pushing on. He could see Eddie the Great Eagle soaring high up in the afternoon sky. Winslow was still hoping that someone would have the answer to his question before the day was over, then something caught his ear. It was Sylvia, the dancing skunk. She was very famous in the forest. She danced very well for a skunk. - [Winslow] Sylvia, does Christmas mean dancing? - [Sylvia] No, Christmas is about things that smell good. [laughter] What are you laughing about banana nose? - [Winslow] A skunk that likes things that smell good. - [Sylvia] Hey no neck, you think that's funny? - [Winslow] I'm sorry, but skunks don't smell good, they smell yucky. - [Sylvia] What you know bear brain? You smell like an old fur coat. I'm outta here. Three, two, one, blast off. - [Winslow] Gosh, she's real fast for a skunk. I guess I shouldn't have laughed at her. I didn't even get to ask her about Christmas. - [Narrator] Oh Winslow. It seemed he'd never find out about Christmas. When suddenly he saw that the entire wolf family was on the other side of the valley. Oh, he was so scared, he tried to climb a tree but it was too little. He tried to dig a hole, but that didn't work either. The tree again, running up the mountain, digging, nothing worked for Winslow. And they were on their way toward him. No, no, no, he had to go! Here they come! - [Winslow] Oh no, oh no, oh no, no. Wait, where did they go? I guess they weren't as close as I thought they were. I better get out of here quick. - [Narrator] Winslow ran to climb a bigger pine tree when he saw Bob the Bobcat. - [Winslow] Bob, can I come up with you? - [Bob] What, are you crazy? There's no room for you up here. - [Winslow] I can't stay down here. - [Bob] Winslow, I'm telling you, you're too big for this little tree. - [Winslow] Please, Bob. You won't even notice me. I'm sorry to intrude, but I have to come up. - [Bob] Hey Winslow, you're bigger than the whole tree. There ain't no room. Go find your own tree. Giant Redwood oughta do it. Come on Winslow, beat it, beat it. - [Winslow] Oh, all right. You don't have to be so cranky about it. I'm leaving. - [Bob] Hey, you better hustle your bustle. Hurry Winslow, hurry. Hey look, don't walk, run, run. - [Winslow] I'm running as fast as I can. Oh, there's a tree that will hold me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Higher, higher. I can't get a whole lot higher, maybe just a little. - [Willard] I found him. Come on down from there, Winslow. - [Winslow] Oh no, you want to have me for dinner. - [Willard] What? Dinner? You? Where'd you get such an idea? Wolves don't eat bears, nobody eats bears. We came to tell you about Christmas. - [Winslow] You did? - [Willard] Why, sure we did. We heard what you were doing. We know what Christmas is. - [Winslow] You do? - [Willard] Course we do. If you weren't such afraid-y bear, you'd know that. Now get your fur lined carcass down out of that tree and I'll tell ya. - [Winslow] Well, okay. - [Willard] Come on, slide down there chubby. - [Winslow] Gee, I better go kinda slow. That bark is rough. Wait Willard, wait for me. I do want to know. Please wait just a minute. Willard, can you tell me what Christmas is? - [Willard] I'm surprised you got up just for that in the first place. - [Winslow] Well, I wanted to know what Christmas is. Can you please tell me now? - [Willard] Yep, I sure can, it's easy. - [Winslow] It is? - [Willard] Indeed-y, Christmas is for families, that's what it is. It's our favorite time of year because we get to spend it together. Yes siree, beg your britches, Christmas is for families. - [Narrator] Winslow looked and saw the happy wolf family running and playing together on Christmas Eve. He had to admit, they certainly looked happy. - [Winslow] Christmas is for families, that's the answer? - [Willard] Yes sir bear, fact of the matter. Christmas is for families and that's where you ought to be with your family. - [Winslow] Gee, why didn't I think of that? Are you sure, Willard? - [Willard] Sure as shooting, I'm sure. Ask Digby the Dog over at the human's house. He'll tell ya. Gotta go now. Come on boys. - [Narrator] And with that, Willard and his whole family ran up the side of the mountain valley and were gone. So Winslow decided he'd do what Willard suggested. He'd go ask Digby, the English setter at the human's house. So many answers to the same question. Christmas was different for everybody. Oh, it was almost more than Winslow's little bear brain could handle. [barking] Now, as Winslow got close to the human's house, he saw his friend Digby and oh, was Digby happy to see him. - [Digby] Winslow, Winslow, I didn't think I'd see you until Spring. Boy, is it good to see you. Boy oh boy. - [Narrator] And Winslow liked seeing Digby too. They always had so much fun together. The two friends played and played until Winslow was very tired. Digby tried to get the tired bear to keep playing, but Winslow just wanted to lie in the snow for a minute and catch his breath. - [Digby] Come on, Winslow, get up. - [Narrator] So Winslow stood all the way up. - [Digby] What are you doing here, Winslow? - [Winslow] Digby, I want to know what Christmas is. Do you know? - [Digby] Do I know what Christmas is? Sure, I know. Christmas is for kids. - [Winslow] Kids, that's what Christmas is? How do you know? - [Digby] Because that's what it is around the human house. If you don't believe me, just go down and ask my little girl. - [Winslow] You have your own little girl? - [Digby] Yep, most dogs have their own humans. She's in the house, go on, ask her. - [Narrator] Well, Digby was his friend, so it must be true. Winslow decided right there and then, he'd do it. The house was just down the hill. Digby and Winslow had rested enough, time to go and ask Digby's little girl and that's exactly what he did. Winslow had never seen anything like the human's house before. He was quite interested. He walked right up to the front door of the house and went in. Meanwhile, Chrissy heard something, so she put down The Magic Storybook and went to look. What was it? Inside, Winslow thought that the house was very wonderful. It was warm and so beautifully decorated, and the tree, why this wasn't like any tree he'd ever seen in the forest. It was a very special tree. It had colored lights and gaily wrapped presents underneath and Winslow thought to himself that this must be what Christmas was. Chrissy was so excited, she hurried downstairs to see who it was. It was Winslow, the very bear she'd been reading about. How wonderful? He'd come to see her. - [Chrissy] I know who you are. - [Narrator] Chrissy said. - [Chrissy] You're Winslow. - [Winslow] That's right, my name is Winslow. I'm very pleased to meet you. - [Narrator] Chrissy was delighted to have a new friend on Christmas Eve. She told Winslow that she'd been reading all about him in his adventure. Winslow was surprised that she knew what he wanted. She showed Winslow all the decorations and that funny old bear even took one down and played with it on the floor. She offered him the most scrumptious treat, a plate of her special Christmas sugar cookies, which Winslow ate right up. - [Winslow] These are really good. - [Narrator] She told Winslow about the Christmas tree in their home and what it meant and that her family celebrated Christmas the very same way every year. She said that everyone was welcome on Christmas because it was the happiest time of year. Finally, Winslow couldn't hold it any longer. - [Winslow] Well, what is Christmas? I've been told so many things. Roger Raccoon said Christmas was food. Willard Wolf said Christmas was for families. Oliver Otter said Christmas was all sorts of things. Wilford, that old Wolverine, said Christmas was a bother. Mother Cougar said Christmas was singing and Digby said Christmas is for kids and now I'm very confused. What is Christmas? - [Narrator] Chrissy just smiled. Christmas is all of those things and a lot more, but most important, said Chrissy, Christmas is love. ♪ Christmas is sharing, giving and caring ♪ ♪ A warm happy feeling that comes from above ♪ ♪ Christmas is love ♪ Christmas means laughter ♪ Joy ever after ♪ Christmas is what the season's made of ♪ ♪ Christmas is love ♪ Christmas is wonder and Christmas is joy ♪ ♪ Christmas is special for each girl and boy ♪ ♪ The time of the year ♪ When their hearts of full of ♪ 'Cause more than anything, Christmas is love ♪ ♪ Christmas is giving, hoping and living ♪ ♪ Christmas is everything good because ♪ ♪ Christmas is love [subtle piano music] ♪ Christmas is wonder ♪ And Christmas is joy ♪ Christmas is special for each girl and boy ♪ ♪ The time of the year ♪ When are our hearts are full up ♪ ♪ 'Cause more than anything, Christmas is love ♪ ♪ Christmas is giving ♪ Hoping and living ♪ Christmas is everything good because ♪ ♪ Christmas is love - [Narrator] Winslow realized that Chrissy was right, Christmas was everything good. Christmas was love and when you shared that with your friends, it became the most special time of year. - [Winslow] Christmas is love. - [Narrator] That's right, said Chrissy. And love isn't love until you share it and for the very first time in his life, Winslow understood what Christmas was. He was so happy. After all the adventures he'd had that Christmas Eve, now he knew the answer. Christmas was love. Chrissy was so happy for him that she hugged the silly old bear. It with the most special Christmas Eve ever. Winslow was so happy about what he'd learned, that he kissed Chrissy. And from that day on, he was known by all his forest friends and by all his human friends as Winslow that Christmas Bear. And now you know the story too. Each year, the story of Winslow the Christmas Bear is told to kids just like you all over the world at Christmas time. And who knows? Maybe this Christmas Eve you'll find a magic story book and read about Winslow yourself. Because you see, Winslow made a promise to himself that Christmas Eve to always remember and never forget that Christmas was love. [subtle piano music] And that's exactly what he did. [subtle piano music] - [Winslow] Wait I forgot, there's one more thing before we go. [whimsical music] - [Narrator] Did you like the animals in Winslow the Christmas Bear? We all like animals, don't we? And these animals are very special too. Did you know that the Bear Winslow was raised from a baby by this man, Troy Hyde? Troy is Winslow's trainer and his very best friend. We all know that animals don't do some of the things you saw them do in the story. The animals you saw were trained to perform certain tricks. Troy trains Winslow the very best way, with love. It takes a great deal of love and patience to understand what animals are really like and to get Winslow's love and obedience, Troy always rewards his favorite bear and Winslow loves it. They play together and work together every day, that's very important. Animals need love and attention just like people do, they have feelings just like you. Troy Hyde has trained all the animals you saw and with each of them, he does the very same thing. He loves them and rewards them. During the filming, the animals would let our cameraman and crew very close to them, but we always remembered that these are wild animals and we treated them with respect. That's important, isn't it? Do you have a pet at home? Do you know of different kinds of animals where you live? You know what? They need love and affection too and you can reward your pet to show that love. It seemed like Winslow could talk in this story, didn't it? But we really know that animals can't talk, but they can communicate with you. Animals don't talk, they feel. That's right, just like us they can feel all the things that we feel and that's how they tell us what they need. Remember, animals are very special, just like you are and we must always treat them like our good friends, because that's exactly what they are.
