RAY: In the early '50s, I wanted to take boxing to every town in America, but the New York City wiseguys were not happy about that. Boxing is a New York City sport, and that it's gonna remain. But this national television tour of yours is taking the spotlight off of the Garden. And that we can't afford. Well, I... (sighs) I think it'll help you in the long run... Frank. If you can trust what I'm saying. TV will turn boxing into a nationwide pastime and you'll have talent and fans from every part of the country coming to see championships at the Garden. I don't give a shit about every part of the country. New York is the heart of the cow. It's the prime meat. If any boxing fan wants to see a fight in the flesh or in front of your little dirty tube, better understand that all roads go through New York. RAY: When they heard I survived, we made a deal. They would spare my life as long as I never made another dollar from boxing. It's a familiar smell. Where were you? What, what are you talking about? Did you go there? Where? That's what I said-- where? Please, you make it sound like I've been with some woman or something. I would rather you were with some woman. Don't always be a district attorney. I was seeing an old friend. You know, it's fine. I'm blonde. I look great in black. I will be a very hot widow. Is that what you want? (sighs) How many years do I have left? REY- These people will kill you. Yeah, well. I might as well be dead already anyway. Oh, what a lovely thing to say to your wife. I don't mean... you, honey. I mean... (sighs) we are what we do. And if you just make money, you become money. This thing that everybody wants that everybody craves, it's just symbolic. It has no real value. I have to do something that I really care about. I'm not an idiot. I know you're miserable. I get it, but those animals run everything. I'd rather live in fear. ("La Luna y el Toro" by Gabino Pampini playing) Pick it up a little, pick it up. You're gonna have to learn to breathe. And you're gonna learn to pace yourself. There's technique and there's strategy. Technique is your every move, your every punch covers all your short-term decisions. Strategy is your plan for the whole fight. It's your long term. It defines how you apply the technique to achieve your major goal. It's okay if your technique fails for a beat as long as you're following the strategy. Buchanan knows you're gonna try to knock him out in the first round. And then he'll wait for you to get tired and try and catch you, and that's his strategy. Comprende? He expect (rapid humming) but if you slow down and go (whooshing, sputtering) slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow... Buchanan no comprende. Get off the fence. Excuse me? Get off the fence.

Now I'm in the Ray Arcel. Ray Arcel? Uh-huh. American school? Yes, American school. You didn't go to school, did you? But you can read, right? This is like a job interview.

And now you're back. Sort of. I like you, Ray. I feel really bad for what they did to you. I don't need to look a gift horse up the ass to know there's shit in there. I thought we had a deal. We do. Maybe I'm confused about what kind of deal we're talking about. You weren't meant to make money from boxing again. I'm training him for free. You can check with Carlos Eleta. He's the fighter's manager. You're a classy guy, but you're not going to teach me how to hide money. Buchanan's favored 14 to three against Duran, right? That's right. Except Duran's going to win. Put all your money on Durén. Make a bundle. Leave me alone if he wins, shoot me if he loses. (chuckles) You're a classy guy. JOURNALiST: Mr. Arcel, why come back from retirement with an unproven fighter? I just turned 73. You know, seven decades and change. And myself and Freddy Brown here have probably forgotten more than most trainers will ever learn. But I remember well, from the '20s to the '50s we lived the golden age of boxing. Then television took over and we all became... ambitious. The sport turned into a spectacle, show business with blood. And it was a good thing, because we reached audiences nobody thought we could reach. The problem, inevitably, is that the fighters started doing it for the fame, for greed, for self-importance. Independent promoters faded away and, with them, the true hungry fighters, the lifeblood of this game. Tonight, however, you'll meet the best lightweight New York has seen in 50 years. A true, true hungry fighter. Like in the old days. He's got the soul, the rage, the mental energy and determination the sport needs, and that's why I'm here. Because a new golden era for boxing begins with Roberto Durén.
