[female narrator] Once upon a time.. ...or so the story has been told.. ...a boy became acquainted to a life under water. [instrumental music] Or as the locals would tell you.. ...a boy became a fish. The boy came from an average suburb.. ...of a great American city. While other kids played typical childhood games.. ...our boy was holding his breath. [bicycle bell ringing] He held his breath everywhere. [music continues] As the boy grew.. ...he dazzled all the town's people with his spectacular ability. [music continues] [music continues] And his legend grew. [band music] The summer before he was to go off into the world.. ...the town's people pled for him to showcase his talents one final time. [music continues] Now, ladies and gentlemen boys and girls I give you.. ...The Submarine Kid. [applause and cheering] This was his final goodbye to the town before entering the real world of endless responsibilities and tedious obligation. [camera whirring] [cheering] [band music] [clock ticking] [camera whirring] [clock ticking] As the minutes grew longer the people got nervous. [intense music] But those closest to him assured the rest of the crowd that this was all part of his grand exhibition. [music continues] But doubts was creeping in. [inaudible] [clock ticking] As the clock turned to 20 minutes past the hour.. ...even the ones who knew him best started to panic. His girl was the first to break away from the crowd.. ...to search. [music continues] [clock ticking] They all searched.. ...and searched.. ...and searched. And they're still searching.. ...to this day. [instrumental music] Oh. [female #1] He's here. Oh. [chuckles] [male #1] There he is. [Mrs. Koll] Oh, look at you. - Welcome home, son. - Oh, Josh, careful, careful. [Josh] Ah, he's fine. He looks great. He looks great. Oh, honey, we missed you so much. - We would have come to get you. - I know. Well, why didn't you want us to come to get you? Come on, sweetheart. Come on. What's up, dingleberry? - Hi. - Hey, you. I love you. [sighs] I told your mom not to clean too much. I know how you like for things to stay the same. Hmm. [Mrs. Koll] Spencer, Emily, dinner! [Emily] But that's what I keep telling him. Uh, well, I am just glad that he's home so we get to see you more. Hmm, well, that's the real reason why I wanted him to come home so I could hang out with you guys. So, Spence, you must be ready to get back to shop. You know, if he was a girl we were gonna name him Emily. - Ran into Marc the other day. - Really? He said he could use some help down there. [cell phone vibrating] [Mrs. Koll] Who is it, honey? Just the guys. Oh, the rat pack. [growls] [chuckles] I think you should answer it. - Hey. - Yo, dude! Hey, man. Yeah. I'm home. - Oh, Nathan's? - No! Uh-huh, there was just a shooting over there. Mom, he just got back from Afghanistan I think he can handle Echo Park. Uh, well, why don't you guys just come here? Oh, okay, I'll ask her. Hey, mom-- - No. - Oh, yeah. She says, "Go fuck yourself, Mailer." - Ooh! - Language. Language. Okay. Yeah, I don't know, I-I'll let you know. Okay. Okay, bye. We should go. Okay. Then maybe later I can show you-- I can go. [Spencer] Oh, that's right, you're of age. [Mrs. Koll] Well, why don't.. You don't have to go tonight. I mean you could see them anytime you want. You're back now...for good. How do you know that? What? I saw it on the news. Look, just-just don't scare your brother, okay? - They're all back for good. - Wait a minute. Cooper, you don't think that's true? [Mrs. Koll] Oh, stop it, Josh, of course it is. Three times was enough. They are not sending you back again. - I'm just sayin'.. - Spencer! [Mrs. Koll] Please will you tell your brother? [rumbling] Let's just go real quick. I wanna show you the apartment, it's really cute. Uh.. Let's just clean up here. I'll tell you what, if I had been at the desert that long they'd have to tear me away from your bedroom. I can't believe he's goin' out with his friend's tonight. Hey, he's young, he wants to see his buddies. - They can't send him back. - No, they won't. - They can't do that to us. - They won't, he's home. - He's fine, he said.. - But we don't know.. Don't listen to Cooper, he doesn't know! - It's all rumors. - We don't know. How can you know? Hey, um, can we have the keys? - Can't Emily take you? - She's not going. That's good. See you later. [instrumental music] Monogamy is an intellectual choice. Amen! We're all fucking animals, okay? And that is my point. And if you think that you have total self control.. Hey, Paul, if you think that you have total self control then...I don't know, man your girlfriend probably fucking hates you. Doesn't matter to me 'cause Imma be fucking her either way. - You're an idiot. - Hey. Yo, fuck me, little brother. All grown up and shit. 'Sup, Howie. Where's Toad? - Everything set? - How's your mom doing, Coop? - Uh, fine. - See, perfect example. You think his mom doesn't have self-control, you're a dumbass. She's been ignoring your little dick for years. Yeah, well, you gotta put in the 50 years if you wanna get the gold watch. I mean think about how many of us have rocked their hurricane with Darla over there. See, that is my point exactly. We are not built to put our seed in just one garden. What does, uh, "Garden" refer to in this context? What the fuck do you think "Garden" refers to, dude? Garden! Garden, vagina, garden, okay? And if you think a woman doesn't have a libido then you, my friend, are the fucking dumbass. When's the last time you used your libido? [all laughing] What's up, puberty? Big brother comes home, think you can join the conversation? Don't pick on him, Mailer, you fucking bully. [clamoring] There he is. Get over here, get over here. Spencer, you jarhead dick Jake Gyllenhaal motherfucker, what's up? Alright...clink, bitches. - Clink. - Clink it up! Hmm. - Yeah. - Oh, you are ripped, dude. Ah, I could still take him. Back on base, I got into fight with these two rednecks. Could've used you. Man, I wish I was there. I could have translated. So, uh, you're for good, or...you're going back? We'll see. Hmm. [upbeat music on radio] - I'm here right now. - Yes, you fucking are. To our hero who's back...to stay. Hey, hey, we're have a true-blooded, whisky-drinkin' turban-chasin', son of America right here. Line up and pay your respects. Buy this man a beer! - Just sit down, sit down. - Buy me a beer too. I can see nothing's changed. Uh, where's Toad? Oh, dude, Toad, he's fucking pissed at you, dude. For not callin' him, he's pissed! Yeah, he's been whining about it all day. He's been acting weird lately. He knew you were comin' back. - So.. - So he left? [Howie] Spencer, have-have you talked with Toad? I'm not sure he wants to see you, buddy. Yeah, but Toad's a fucking sensitive vagina, man. Let's go in the back, let's fucking forget about it. I don't know if I'm in the mood. What, you'd take down a sheikh and now you don't party no more? - Fine. - Yeah! That's more like it. - Dead man walking! - Let's go, come on. I can't believe fuckin' Toad isn't here. Are you gonna bitch about this all night? Should have called us more, man. Yeah. What, we're not good enough for you, Spence? [Howie] It's like his third time by how am I suppose to keep getting hyped up for this shit? [instrumental music] Why didn't you call me, you asshole? [grunts] Fuck you all. He was so damn sad. I can't wait to tell Emily how dumped you were. Man, you wanna play with the winner? I don't see a winner around. I guess I'll play with you. It's good to see you. Ah! - No! - What? - Back again, boogers! - Yes! [pop song playing] [Toad] Take the shot. Spencer, take the shot! [man on radio] Talon to 1-1, take the shot. Take the shot. Take the shot, dude! [people chanting] Take the shot! - Take the shot! - Take the shot! - Take the shot! - Take the shot! [cheering] - Yes! In your face. - Whoa! [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [groaning] [door bell beeps] Hey! There he is. Look at you. Hey. So you're back? I'm back. Let's see that badge of courage. - No. - Come on. Who gives a fuck? Alright, fine. Yeah, that's a good one. You're damn lucky. Hey, you know that. So, uh, you need a little help around here? [chuckling] Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to, uh.. ...pull a few tricks to get the business on track. You know, this is a good opportunity for you here. - How long are you back? - I don't know. They say for good, but that's probably bullshit. I'd love for you to put in some time here, you know. Give you a chance to be a part of a growing business. Really? Well, like I said there's a chance. You've seen what the neighborhood's turning into and a new hip boutique pops up every day. I gotta capitalize on this, right? Because nostalgia is the new cool. But only to a point apparently. - So no one's comin' in? - Exactly. You know, I gotta make people feel like they're-they're not walking into a dungeon.. ...or, or.. ...if they are walking into a dungeon it's gotta be a cool fucking dungeon, doesn't it? Improvise, adapt and overcome. Hoo-rah! Frankly, my, uh, my pockets are dryin' up. I need a new sign for starters. You know, somethin' they actually look up to from their phones. I could do that. Fantastic. This is gonna be good for you. Believe me. You know, idle hands and all that shit. Can you start now? [thudding] Imma take this order to the post office. Can you watch the shop in case someone comes in? Yeah, sure. I'm gettin' some chow. You want somethin'? No, I'm good. Alright then. I'll leave you to it. [water splashing] [squeaking] [door bell beeps] [instrumental music] [music continues] Hi. [Spencer] Hi. Do you, uh, do you work here? Um, yeah. Uh, do you possibly have any old newspapers, magazines? That kinda stuff? Um.. ...I'm sure there are something like that around here. Well, we have to find the right pile. I know you. I, I saw that article about you in the paper. I remember your picture. - Yeah. - So.. You guys all done over there? Shot the bad guy and everything? Something like that. Well, glad to see you're back in one piece. I just got here myself. I'm Spencer. Alice. - Alice? - Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah, sorry, I wish I knew where that stuff was I really just started here today. Doing maintenance mostly. I'm gonna build a new sign for the front. Probably fix the whole Dewey Decimal situation in here. [chuckles] The guy who owns the place is out but he should be back pretty soon, so.. Maybe I'll just.. ...poke around and see if I can find something useful. Yeah. [instrumental music] [sighs] The.. These are perfect. Oh, good. You know like a...school project or something? Uh, no, I'm just tryin' to find some images for a new book. Oh. You're a writer? Hmm, not exactly, it's more like a scrapbook. I've been scavenging for material. So are you like in the scrapbooking business? Oh, no, I was working at a pet store for a while. They were jerks. There comes a point where you just have to.. ...break away and follow your dreams. That's probably true. I mean if you find something you really love. - Right? - Right. So what do you love, Spencer? Uh, wha.. I-I'm just asking, like.. - Do you love bein' a soldier? - Marines, it's a bit different. I don't know about that stuff. Isn't it like you go to school though, or.. If I wanted that, I guess, yeah. Well, then w-why join? I mean why-why go away? Honestly? Everyone's always asking you what you wanna do? What you wanna make? The Marine Corp just gives you that. You don't have to think about it. It's not your decision when you're a part of something bigger. Well, being a part of something bigger.. ...doesn't make it better. You know that, right? Is that how you convince yourself to leave the pet store? [Alice laughing] Oh, no, I.. [clears throat] I got fired because I hate cats. [both laughing] - Yeah. - You know something? - Hmm? - I hate cats. Really? They're horrible. They're so mean. - Angry. - They scratch me. They.. - Generally unpleasant and.. - Horrible. Wait, my parents had this giant cat just would look at me and urgh...horrible. My girlfriend has two, and they just.. Well...uh.. I.. I-I guess I'll just, uh, I'll take these.

Yeah, but we can at least have breakfast together. [sighs] I need to get to the shop. Spencer.. ...I've waited like.. ...three years to wake up next to you and eat breakfast with you in our place. This is our new life. It's finally here. I wanted that too. You don't want this anymore? You wanted this the last time you were back. Don't do this to me. Okay, I'm doing the best that I can. Just..

[Marc chuckles] [grunts] [dramatic music] [radio static] [knocking on door] [breathing heavily] Hey. - Hey! - I-I didn't mean to scare you. That's okay, I.. Well, I just wanted to say I saw the new sign. Looks really great. Caught my eye. Thanks! That's the hope. [Alice] I thought it never rained here. That's just not true, transplant. Well, it should be. I pinned you for some Virginia Woolf fan who loves the gloomy whether. You are so-- Come on in, I'm just closing up. I'm so what? I don't know. I don't know what you are.

Oh, uh, Mailer's second cousin's godfather knows the guy who owns this place. - Okay, and you hooked up with-- - That guy's daughter. Yeah, it was awesome. I got it. The little bitch is crying in the corner. - This is Howie from Texas. - Hello. All the guys say I'm a stereotype of myself or whatever the fuck that means? Yes, we're all very proud of our resident moron here. Uh, pot, kettle, kettle, pot. Eat my shit, Paul. [chuckles] Spencer, I'm wearing a tie. You might as well call me a pussy vandal tonight.

Well, if this is something that you think you need.. ...Spencer.. ...fucking go for it. Do it. Nobody knows better than you. Emily was your perfect girl.. ...this stuff is different. I mean you can't be nice all of your life. And if this feels real, you might as well follow it. Go for it. I mean that's what you always said to us. "Just follow what's real."

Hey, Spencer, I'm Doctor Fisk. I want you to take it easy. I don't want you to say anything now. You were in that water there for quite a bit. You had a near drowning. It appears you aspirated a pretty significant amount of water that was very cold. [Dr. Fisk] And we're fortunate that your body has been trained up in that sort of thing. So I just want to ask you a couple of questions. What's your name? Spencer Koll. Do you know what the date is? Thursday, I'm not really sure. Do you know what month it is? - June. - Good. Who is the President? Obama. I think you're gonna do just fine. I do wanna keep you here for just a tad longer though, okay, bud? I wanna keep an eye on the lungs I wanna do some respiratory monitoring and then we'll let you go. - Where is-- - She'll be down in a minute. The other nurses let her know you're here. It's okay.

How the fuck did we let this happen? We didn't. You just don't dwell on it, okay? Our job right now is to be here. - That's all we can do. - No. Hey, how is he? He's, he's alive, you know. I mean that's good. Where's everybody else? Well, they're still passed out. It was a real shit show. Yeah. Emily! Hey, Em.. [woman on PA] Attention please, will the Garcia family please return to the ICU. Garcia family, please return to the ICU. Hey, Em. - Is he awake? - Yeah. Just. Come on in. We'll wait outside.

Two-person tag that doesn't even make sense. It was your idea. Well, you should stop listening to me. I'm pretty sure you're the first woman in the history of the world to ever say that. Just kiss me. Okay, if I have to. Can we live here? [laughs] Don't you maybe, uh, want somewhere that has, I don't know, a ceiling? - Some walls? - No, what for? We need our own dog. That's the first thing. One, two, three, golden retriever. Golden retriever. [Emily] Spencer. [gasping] Spencer, look at me. Hey, hey. Sir, you can't leave against medical adviser not signing.. - Where you going? - Excuse me. I can't be here anymore, I have things to do. [Mrs. Koll] What things? Wait-wait-wait, take it easy. [Toad] Calm down. You wanna get outta here? Let's go, I'll go with you. [groans] Hey, Spencer? Spencer. Spencer. What the fuck happened last night? I killed that girl, man. She was with me. No one knows she was there, do they? No man, you zipped off alone last night. I think you might be a little loopy right now. This is exactly what I need. [beeping] She wasn't with you, man so don't beat yourself up about it...okay? You were a little tipsy, you were high on fuckin' adrenaline. The crash messed with your memory stick, that's all. - Do you have her number? - There are no coincidences. That's what I've learned. She found this book at the party. It was in the library and she recited every fucking word of it from memory. Holy Grail. Destiny kinda shit. I don't know what you're talkin' about, man. Look, I'll-I'll go check at the lake. I need you to help me maximize my extended breath-hold. I'm out of practice. Hold this. Spencer, what is going on with you, man? Press start when I go under. Spencer! Spencer! Spencer! Okay. Peanut butter...or.. ...peanut butter and jelly? How do you eat a peanut butter sandwich? Doesn't it stick to your mouth? I like it. This jelly is so slimy. - You're slimy. - You're slimy. No, you literally kinda slimy. [laughs] No. No! - We should make a toast. - What to? [sighs] I don't know. You do it. To long life. Is that supposed to be ironic? [laughs] Okay. Uh, to peace on Earth. You're boring. Fine, I don't know. - To boobs. - Boobs? Well, I guess that's something. Clink. [coughing] Hey, hey. Breathe. [grunts] [groans] - What was my time? - Fuck you, man. Fuck. You have to stop it when I come out of the water! Goddammit! What the fuck? What the fuckin' hell, stuntman. Yeah, think of all the times we could have like-- Halloween? I really don't recall that night. Well, dude, you were driving. Well, if you remember it so well why weren't you drivin'? I'll punch you in the liver. [sighs] Are his parents home? Like, maybe we should go in to garage. The whole point was for us to wait for him here. Yeah, but if we're smokin', then maybe we shouldn't do that in a seedy alley, genius. Cops patrol back here. Would you at least grow a right nut, Paul? Don't have to go for both, I know that's a lot to ask from you, but just invest in half the package-- [knocking on window] - Jesus Christ! - Uh, come on. You're like the fuckin' seed of Chucky, man. You know, Toad's been callin' me. What the fuck is going on? Uh, we saw it all. It's fine, okay? Look, they pulled the car out, there was no one in there she couldn't have been with him. - Well, how can you be so sure? - I swear on my life, man. We just came from there. Well...then where is she? Look, we saw him leave, we didn't see her leave, okay? What do you think, they had like a secret rendezvous point or somethin'? Calm down. It's nothin' to worry about. Toad said that Spencer said-- Consider tangible evidence versus the fucked up post-accident mind of your hero, okay? He's not working on a practical level. Don't get on an edge about it. No, not an edge, I'm tryin' to figure out-- Chill out, bro, okay? I'm done with the conspiracy theories. Let's get some tunes goin'. [upbeat music on radio] Oh, you have to kill me. - What...cops? - Uh, girlfriend. Oh! Crap, hide. - Let's hide. - Where do you wanna hide? What, the glove compartment or somethin'? - Hey, you guys, come on. - Alright. Oh. Hey. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Hey, Emily. We didn't even see you there. [Emily] He's not with you? Uh, no, uh, we're waiting for him, he's still with Toad. He told you to say that? - No. - No, it's true. Why did you guys leave him alone last night? We didn't. Ask Cooper, he'll tell you all about Alice. You, idiot. That's not a thing. I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm.. I'm kidding. Cooper's such a nut. Who's Alice? Look, Em, we don't wanna get in the middle of this? Too late now, Cooper. - How you doin', Em? - Who's Alice? I'm gonna take off with these guys. [Mailer] Hey, what's up? Everything alright? - No, not really. - What happened at the lake? [Toad] Yeah, we checked it out. Took a look around. She's not there. [Mailer] That's not what Spencer was saying to me. Spencer. Okay, I just need to say this. I've been thinking, and I can't pretend like I'm not angry and you need to understand that I have every right to be angry. I wanna give you whatever space it is that you're needing but I also wanna be there for you because you clearly cannot be here for yourself. So let's just start with you doing a much better job of talking to me. [breathing heavily] [timer beeps] What are you doing? I broke my record. Are you even listening to me? Most of the time. Spencer, I'm trying to tell you that I think you need help. Yes, will you time me? Who's Alice? Where did you meet her? - At work. - When? I don't know, what's the day. Did you know her before you broke up with me? - I didn't break up with you. - God, God, don't say that. It makes it worse. - Did you know her? - Yes. - Did you sleep with her? - Em.. Don't act like it's not an important question. I didn't say no. Can't you just-- Can't you just what? Figure it out, stupid girlfriend or sometimes-girlfriend or whatever it is that I am? My God, Spencer, you were so good and now lying and not telling the truth all at once. It's just a thing that happened. So that's it? You come back and it's like five years together that's just gone? You had your freedom, and now you come back and you're some kinda guy that takes random girls to parties? You don't think that I know that I fucked up. Whatever I'm feeling it's not about you. The whole thing has nothing to do with you. And you see this one. Did he take out that tree too? That's what it did to the car. - Where were you? - Spencer? - Sit down! - Hello, Spencer, how are ya? [Josh] I'll call Henry. I understand you had a bit of an accident last night. Yes, sir. The main thing is we just wanna get you back where you need to be. What if you get called back? Your country and-and our family need you to be ready for that. Listen, now-now legally you're just lookin' at damage to the guard rail a few private trees, things like that, simple stuff. No real harm done there. But we know about the boy at the party. Cell phone videos, all that. Family lawyer has got in touch with us. Now, luckily there's no brain damage. Gonna be some reconstructive surgery necessary. I think it's much better.. ...if we just sweep it away, settle out of court. Your parents and I'll pay off all the bills. [muffled voice] And you are gonna work off every last cent, you understand me? [Henry] Yes, you'll pay off the bills. We can deal with that later. I think what's much more important here is that everyone's concerned about you. The way I see it, Spencer, the only way out is through. Your parents are here, your friends, they can all help. But you're gonna have to just look this thing right in the face and deal with it. Be a man. Say your I'm sorrys. And move on. This isn't a damn game. Didn't they teach you discipline? [knocking on window] Josh, please. Spence, let's go. [Mrs. Koll] Guys, no, not now. Not now. You know, what, these guys need to understand the gravity of the situation. They're half the problem. - Let's go, guys, come on. - Hey! - Come on, this way. - Come on. We're getting out of here. [sighs] [instrumental music] [chuckles] This is like the best day ever. What is this? I've got a surprise for you. Where? [instrumental music] [gasping] [people cheering] [both chuckling] This is heaven? Or a dream? Is this the book? Alice, uh, are these people from the book? Come on, you know the answer. [both chuckle] Just stop asking questions. It's just a place like any other. But can it last forever? Can anything? If you don't let it end, it doesn't have to. [chuckles] It'll never have to. Right? Only question you should be asking.. [sighs] ...is where should I be right now. I know the answer. Here. With you. [instrumental music] I'm-I'm-I'm starting to feel like that might not be a victory, Spencer. Why don't you wanna be back with all those people who are waiting for you? - Oh, I can't. - Why? Because.. ...I've.. ...I've done things. What-what-what things? Terrible things. - Spencer-- - I can't breathe up there. They never found my body, did they? Spencer, oh my God. Breathe. Breathe! Wake up, breathe. [crying] Spencer. Mom? - Spencer, wake up. - No, no, let be back. - No, Spencer. Spencer! - Let be back. Spencer, if you father sees you doing this, he'll go crazy. Look at me! Look at me. Oh, baby. [sobbing] You need, you need to stay here. - Here, Spencer. - No, no. - I can't stay here. - Stop! - Spencer, stop it! - I can't stay here. Please let me help you. [crying] Spencer? Spencer? Let's go. Come on, man. Stop, stop. Just stop, stop. Let's slow down. - Just slow everything down. - What for? What for? Come on, you're so intense right now. Let's just...take a deep breath and talk about where we go from here. That's the theme of the day. Yeah, well, do you realize what you just did? I broke five minutes, man. The Submarine Kid broke twenty. [panting] I think she can hold her breath forever. Spencer, I have no idea what you're talking about. Just more practice then I can stay with her! Stop thinking about this shit! Quit it! Let's just take your brother, we can go to Nathan's. On the way at least we can get a case of beer and a sack of weed and fucking relax and talk about. No, man! Let me do this! Do what? Wait. What are you doing? [beeps] [gasping] [timer beeps] Not good enough. [panting] [instrumental music] "Although her car was recovered "the body of the 23-year-old suspected driver "remains missing as of this morning.. "...in Thunder Lake. The girl, Alice Shelley.." [female reporter] ...is previously engaged to the local legend known as The Submarine Kid disappeared in the same lake exactly two years ago. Authorities have now confirmed the accident as suicide though many of her friends described the girl overcome with grief since the mysterious disappearance of her fiance. No, no, no, no. No, this can't be fucking happening. This can't be fucking happening. No, no, no. Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck! [gasping] Goddammit! Goddammit! Let me back! [screaming] [screaming] [panting] [music continues] [panting] Fuck, Spencer! [panting] I didn't know you were here. I'm sorry, Marc. I'm so fucking sorry. This isn't about you. I shouldn't have brought this here. Don't apologize for this. Can you talk to me? What do you want me to say? Just tell me the truth. The only easy day was yesterday. No, man, no bullshit. I want the truth. [instrumental music] [Marc] What is this? It's a book about me. Spencer.. ...I know you won't believe me, but whatever this is it's not your story. You think you're escaping the bullshit with this but you're just going farther into it. You're lost. I was just like you. I came back, I was a shell. I had to retrace the steps. It's hard work. I know how tempting it looks.. ...but just getting out is not real freedom. Obsessing over this kind of shit is just an escape. Deal.. ...with what's real. Tell me what's going on. Spencer? [instrumental music] [door opens] [Spencer] Shut the door. - Did they hear me? - No. This came for you. It's from the marines. You can open it. Don't look up to me. [music continues] Are you okay? Toad's coming to get us. Get ready. Where are we going? [music continues] This is my favorite place in the world. [laughs] This is my favorite place in the world. Do you hear that? You're my favorite place in the whole fucking world! You're almost perfect, you fucking lake! [Howie howling] ♪ Balls so hard motherfuckers wanna find me ♪ ♪ But first they gotta find me ♪ Look who worked off his hangover. Yeah, took all fucking day. Well, I'm here. - Take the beer. - Give me the beer. Alright, guys, listen up. I don't wanna get all cheesy fucking sentimental with you guys, but you are my brothers. And I've been thinking ever since this sister got back. And no matter what the fuck happens.. ...you know, no matter how crazy this world gets you guys are the one thing that I've got that's never going away. And God help me for the grief I'm gonna suffer for this but I fuckin' love each and every one of you, alright? [Howie] Yes. Clink, bitches. [timer beeping] Hey, come on. - Good girl. - Hey. Hey, let's build a house. I know how to do it. We can't stay here. I know everything. I saw what happened to you. I don't care. You want me to be like him? I am. I can show you. We can stay here. Spencer, there's roads waiting for both of us. It won't be like this forever. I love you. The worst is almost over and then we'll have perfection. Look around. Perfection. Right? [sobbing] There's no such thing.. [rumbling] You can't hide from her with me. Wait. Wait. [gasping] [laughing] Hey, ten minutes and fourteen seconds, dude. [laughing] [Toad] Are you fucking kidding me? He almost drowned in the sink right there. - This is not fucking okay. - Chill out, he's fine. We were with him the whole time. He's not fucking fine, Nick. Does he look fucking fine to you? He's coughing water all over the fucking floor. Stop, come on, come on, come on, stop, stop. [Spencer] I'm fine. - Did you say ten minutes? - Hell, yeah, bro. But I'm not sure it should count since your ass passed out. Fucking idiots. Come on, get up. Well, what do you guys say? Huh? Huh? Am I in line? Let's check with the Russian judge. Fuck off, Howie! It's not funny! Wow, he was actually mad. I knew comin' up here was a bad idea. Yo, what, hey. What if he really just died right now? - I'd feel bad about that? - You-you'd feel bad about that? You're the master of the understatement, Howie. Fuck! [chuckles] [Cooper] Hey, man, you really think he was trying to drown himself? [upbeat music] What the hell is matter with you? I'm in love. With something that's fake. It's fake, it's a figment of your imagination. Can't you just.. ...see her in your dreams or somethin'? [scoffs] That's stupid. No, what's fuckin' stupid is you dunkin' your head in sinks and having people time you. That's fucking stupid. It's a matter of opinion, man. Spencer.. ...you're scaring me. You are playing some kind of game with God. And if you keep going on like this.. ...you're never gonna come up. Fuck, man, draw a picture of her. Or write a story, so that maybe I can meet her but just-just fucking stop this. Stop it. [Toad] What is that? Spencer, you realize there's people that actually need you.. ...right? What do you want? I mean you wanna go away? You wanna leave this place then do it, go. But don't leave your life, I mean.. ...do you hear the way that kid talks to you? Yeah. Good. Hear it. Because we all feel that way. We all love you, Spencer. Now, look me in the eye and tell me that you're not gonna disappear. I'm not gonna disappear. Don't fuck with me, man, I trust you. Clink, bitch. Hmm. Alright. [man on TV] You can say that, but what is his team going to do? They have no identity. They have no identity at all. What I'm concerned about is really the outfield player. I mean, if-if he, if he can't get guys.. [door opens] [indistinct chatter on TV] [man on TV] It doesn't make any sense, Jim. It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense. [Jim] I completely agree with you. Okay, they-they've got.. [man on TV] Well, that's my point exactly, Tim, I mean.. [dramatic music] [helicopter whirring] [man on radio] Talon-11 Actual, Eagle-11 Actual No joy under HVT, he's gone to ground. Uh, move out the extract towards Oscar Mike over. Roger that. Talon Actual out. Fuck this day. So when we get back to base, the next round's on you. Round's on your mom. My mom will kick your ass, bro. Your mom could kiss my ass. [leaves rustling] Shit! Eagle-11, Talon Actual, we have eyes on targets of opportunity. ...we are weapons-free, over [man on radio] Talon-11, take the shot. [radio static] Take the shot. - Fucking.. - What's the plan, boss? Eagle-11, let's take it, let's take it. [indistinct radio chatter] - Roger that, weapons free. - 'Weapons free.' [man on radio] Do not take the shot. I say again, do not take the shot. [gunfire] [shouting indistinctly] [gunshot] [intense music] [gunfire] Come on, let's go! Let's go now! [gunfire] [gunshot] [shouting indistinctly] [gunfire] Talon One is compromised. Redirect for immediate medevac. Position...one click south of original. [indistinct chatter] Let's get him out of here. Let's go. Let's go. Move it, move it. [dramatic music] [inaudible] [water gushing] Hey, Spencer? Oh, shit. Toad, Toad, Toad. Toad, Toad, wake up. Yo, read this, dude. Wake up, man, he's out. He's out, man. It's over, he's discharged. - Spencer? - Where are you? [Josh] Boy! Spencer! [Mailer] Yo, where are you? It's time to celebrate. [Toad] Yo, where are you, man? Spence? Spence? - Oh, shit! - Spencer! Man, have you seen Spencer? Check it out, man, he's done. He's in the fucking lake. [instrumental music] Spencer! [indistinct] Spencer! No! Let me go! Spencer! - No, no, stay here. - Spencer! Spencer! [music continues] [male #10] Spencer! Spencer! Fuck! Spencer! Fuck, man! - Spencer! - Spencer! Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Spencer! I've been working on something for you. I've been training myself like the kid did. This way we could be together forever. We can't do this anymore. This has to be goodbye. What do you want me to do, pretend I'm in love with someone else? I want you to stop pretending. I stopped. I pretended you were him, but you're not. I'm becoming him. Isn't that what you want? It's not enough. You see, you see this dress this, this place.. ...none of this belongs to you. It.. ...belongs to him. I thought I could stop waiting and find someone else but it doesn't work that way, Spencer. But he didn't die. He went off to find something better. - Just like me. - No! I waited. I waited and I never got an answer. I tried to make you into what I needed. But it's not real. But I can prove it to you. I tried to be something else for you. Just like you're trying to be for me. But it's a mistake. I'm not the thing you needed so badly to want. Give me my peace, Spencer. It's the only thing, that'll save us both. Just.. It's a fresh start when I go under. You'll see so clearly this is all real. It's everything we both wanted. [instrumental music] Go! [music continues] [timer beeping] [Emily] Spencer! Somebody call fucking help! How the hell did this happen? How did you let this happen? [Toad] What are we supposed to do, Emily? Huh? What was I supposed to do? We need to get back out there, we need to find him. Ah! He promised me that he wasn't gonna disappear. Don't be stupid. You are such idiots, you let him jump in the fucking lake! I hate this stupid, fucking lake! Emily. Come on, come on. [instrumental music] [timer beeping] [beeping continues] Ah! Alice, stop the watch. I know that was my best time yet. [gasping] I counted to at least.. What? [panting] [panting] [sobbing] [instrumental music] [Alice] Once upon a time.. ...or so the story has been told.. [music continues] ...a boy became..
