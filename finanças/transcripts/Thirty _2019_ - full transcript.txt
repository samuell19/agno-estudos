Pascal. Hey Övi... did I wake you? Sorry. - No I'm already awake. - Had some bad dreams... - Well, tell me. - I'm on my way to Raha's... To Raha's? Are you guys getting back together again or something? What, no. We had a long, shitty conversation on the phone yesterday... She called me... it was all fucked up. I'll bring my set of key to hers now and head to work afterwards. So what's the plan for later? We'll meet around nine at my place. I already told everyone. Did you already tell Raha?... Of course I invited Raha, she's coming along with Kara. Why, what about it? Nothing, just so I know... I could leave work early and come to your place, what do you think? I need to get my writing going, man. Ok... then I'll be there at around nine too. All right then. Ciao. I think it looks quite nice now, with almost nothing in here. One could say that it looks very empty, but I'd rather say that it is very minimalist, very Danish... almost Scandinavian like... I bet you can have a clear mind in here, with that much space... If you only knew how it looks at my place, Raha, I couldn't even manage to unpack a single box... and that flat is so crappy, it's so ugly... Man, you won't believe what happened yesterday, I was just going down the staircase, and suddenly the lights went off. And I started hearing a very strange sound, you know, it was this feeling, of like not being alone, although you know there is actually no one there. You know what I mean? So I moved towards the light switch, turned it on, and then I see these two rats, fucking right there. By the way, that's actually my shelf, ain't it? I should pick that up sometime... Sure. You know what, I could leave it here, I mean if you need it, 'cause I actually don't... I don't need it. Honestly, you can keep it, that's no problem, I have no use for it. I don't need it either. By the way, can you manage to pay the rent? I mean, if you can't, I could keep paying for a while. I'm fine. Honestly. It doesn't bother me to keep paying. I won't be alone here from next month on. Are you telling me that you already have someone new? Kara will be moving in. Kara? I thought she has her own flat? Did she give it up? But you know how weird she can be... she's always working the whole night, that doesn't work between you, guys... Do you mind if I just get dressed for work? All right then... Don't you think we should try to stay together? Can't we stay together... without really being together? We could split this room in two parts, we could use that shelf... I could take the part with no windows... if you prefer that. Or I could move here into the hallway, and we would stay together... I just don't get it... What's the use of being together... just to split up again? Can't we just not split up? Pascal, you were the one that broke up with me. Yeah, that's true... I'm really glad that we're getting along so well. That's very good... See you later. Hey Connie! Sorry, I was showering and didn't hear my phone... Yup... Yup... I already told you I don't want to do it, I'm still hoping for that theatre to get back to me... Pascal?! Is it you? Do you recognize me? That's unbelievable, you haven't changed a bit. You look amazing! This is Pascal, we were schoolmates. We were friends as kids. Well, actually our fathers were friends. To be fair, they went to the same school together. And then one day, monsieur decided to go to Berlin, to become a CEO. Incredible, right? Tell us, how much do you make per month? 4,000? 5,000? How are you? How's you're mother? My Mom is very good. Funny that you're asking, I should definitely call her right now, she'll be so surprised. You don't have to... That's ok, wait a second, you'll see, she's going to be so happy to talk to you. Actually I just applied for a job, here in Berlin, you never know, maybe it'll work out. Hello Mommy? Yes... well, guess who is right here standing next to me now? It's Pascal. You remember? Yes, the one from school. He's in Berlin too, yes. Wait, I'll pass him the phone... Hello Vivianne! How are you? Very good, very good. Thank you. Yeah, we will see. Ok then, Vivianne, see you. Kisses... kisses... Ok, Vivianne, bye now... What did I tell you... Unbelievable. Ok then, Mom, talk to you later then. Yes, I will call you. Wow, isn't that crazy? You know, I looked for you on Facebook now and then, and I have to say, it's quite remarkable what you have accomplished. You must be really proud of yourself, aren't you? And what about that girlfriend of yours? Kara? Chiara? Raha. Raha, the dancer, right? Raha, no... she's an actress. Right, I see. We're not a couple anymore. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. No, no, no need to feel sorry. She had such smelly breath, that I couldn't stand sleeping next to her. It was quite bad. Man, I really don't know why I just said something like that. It's definitely not true, she is a great person. To be completely honest, I will be moving to Tokyo soon. Wow! And actually that's the reason why, because of the distance Berlin-Tokyo, you know... That's unbelievable, are you being sent there for work? No, no. I just resigned, I'm going there for myself. You know, I was sitting at home all by myself, just a while ago and I started to wander around through Tokyo, via Google Maps. And I really started liking it. Everything looked so different, so abstract and I asked myself, hey, why not leave everything behind and go live in Tokyo?! Where nobody knows you and you can live in complete anonymity. Being free, you know... I mean, it's not like I already have booked a plane ticket or something... Actually, do you know what happens when you type in "Tokyo" into Google Maps, but you are located in Neukölln? The whole world makes a full spin around itself! The whole world makes one full spin! So, I thought - that's exactly what I need right now, to turn it all over, that's it! All good? Of course, I'm feeling great! You know what, we should get shitfaced, right now! Oh. Well, I'd love to, but you know, we are... I know a super nice bar, it's just around the corner. - Well. You know... - I'd really like to, but we... we already have plans and... you know, next time maybe, ok? Yeah, sure, too bad. - It was really nice to meet you. - I let my mom know about your great plans... Hey Övi... What's up? Are you at your place? I'm just heading out to quickly meet Henner. At Bierbaum. No... just for five minutes... Man, you know I really have to get some writing done. Ok... well, then just come over. See you in a bit. Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday, dear Övünç! Happy Birthday to you! Congratulate him! - Happy Birthday! - Thank's a lot, thank you... Congratulate him! Time to buy some razor blades... Great suggestion. At least you have a beard. You are aware that my birthday actually is tomorrow? Today, tomorrow, the day after, yesterday... Ain't it all the same? Yeah... I guess so... You have a lighter? Sure. So what's up? Anja! Come here. Just met Anja, wonderful woman. I'm Övünç, hi... Oh well... Hi... Nice to meet you... - So it's your birthday? - Sure. Well. All the best! Want some Beer? What, why? What? Shit... - No, no. That's not allowed here! - Otherwise you have to leave! - Come on, just a little celebration? - Not in here, my friend! Party? At my place? - No, no. - I really have to do some writing, man... - You can write at my place! - You always felt most inspired at my place. You're in? No, I have an appointment. Maybe later? - Later? Tonight? - I'll have a little birthday party. - Cool! - At my place... I'll be glad to... - Do you know where I live? - No. I'll write it down. Sorry... Can I have a pen and a piece of paper? Thank you. What's up? Are we going to your place now, right? No, we're going to Henner's place. What? We're going to Henner's place. I thought we're heading to your place? - Yeah, tonight... - But you said today around nine... and now you want to go to Henner's? Come on, I'm not in the mood for Henner... You said before on the phone that we were going to your place... - Man, ok, just a sec. - I'm really not in the mood for Henner. Ok, just wait a second. All set then? "Sonnnenallee"... "Övünç"... That way. - See you later then. - See you. So... What's the matter? Yesterday we went to that exhibition. By Ivy Haarmen. You know, the one being hyped right now. I had high expectations, because the critics were so good. It was packed with people, you almost couldn't walk. And the air at Bethanien can get quite shitty sometimes. Anyways, from the aesthetical point of view, it was like leather and vinyl stuff, with sculptures and the like. The original theme was "femininity as a subject". Or "femininity and it's longing". So we walked around and I felt like... I don't know, I wasn't really into it. Maybe because I didn't really understand it, but also that combination of "Eco-chic" people... I don't know. It was rather grotesque. But it was a very trendy vibe in there, and afterwards, there were lots of people standing around, drinking. And Lilly happened to somehow know the artist... or rather knows people who know her, So we ended up... standing in a group. Then she appeared, she was like 1 meter 60 tall, yes, alright... I mean, it's not her fault. A very small, like tiny person, extremely friendly, with her hair in a clean side parting, and all dressed up in a kind office style, looking like she's working in a bank or something, with semi expensive jewelry, stood around and was very polite and friendly with everyone, talking about her next exhibitions... And first I thought that she had a strange kind of vibe, but then she was surrounded by lots of curators, all of them huge, 1 meter 90 tall men, all flattering her... And she was quite friendly in the beginning... smiling, saying "yes" to everything they said, but then slowly started talking, in her polite way, about matriarchy and cannibalism. And about some archipelago, where human sacrifices are being made. And that situation was actually quite funny, because all those alpha males surrounding her, at first were still friendly, interested and listening to her, but after a while, they all got kind of stiff, because she was talking so calm and friendly, with her soft voice... She was kind performing. And then I thought, hell, this situation was more interesting, than the exhibition itself. That was the point when I started to think about the topic. And then I was quite impressed, and I started liking her. And I started reflecting about the people that we know... I mean, we talk a lot about those issues, but in the end, someone has to go, in order to really get dominance in conversations, it's much more subtle in the end, than just using all of those clichés. So... That's when I started... to think about us... Well... and... about you, And I thought that the problem between you and Pascal is exactly- - Do you have some chewing gum? No. Sorry... Can I sleep over? Sure, of course. I've sublet my flat again... - Do you need money? - I can lend you some. No, I don't rent it out for money, I'm fed up with that flat, also I prefer when things are moving. Lately... It happens to me all the time, that I wake up... and don't know what am I alive for. I wake up... and... I think to myself: Why should I get up? There is no reason for getting up. Also no one is interested if I get up or not. And then... I lay there for a while... And all of sudden... I get overwhelmed by a feeling of great hope. That everything will be fine... Such a mighty, positive feeling... It's so intense, that I jump up, thinking... that I finally know how one should live. One just needs to work. Do you maybe have a laptop...? Yes, it's right underneath where you're sitting at. Next weekend we'll make some sort of "cleansing trip", with magic mushrooms and the like, why don't you join us? Nah, I'm not so into it... - Really? - I have to admit that I really like it. We once did something like that, up in the mountains, we were in a group of five and went all the way up, on the top was another group of people, playing the violin in front of an unbelievable sunset. And then they all sat down... and started eating fish out of tins. Damn, I look like a clown. - Can I help you? - Yeah... Where's your brush? Here. Tell me when it hurts. But don't pin them up. Why not? I like it. Yes, but then my double chin is visible. You don't have a double chin, Kara. Oh, yes I do. Look... That way I also have a double chin. Lately, I have such a pain in my neck... Me, too! I know that feeling. And also headaches... I think I know where it comes from... that's the stiff neck I guess... Hey Darling, what's up? Hey, Honey... Do you have some mascara for me? Sure. Take some from my left eye. Shit, I can't open my eyes anymore... how sweet... Is that you or is it your chin? That's how you look after having two kids. Come on, Henner... I think we should arrange them... Come on people, let's get this done now. Ok, you stop that right now. Thanks. Let's make it together. You just hold this. - You guys know that story? - The story with Benny's girlfriend? That story of Benny's girlfriend and the birthday cake? Can you please put another one there. Over here. Yes. And these two over here. - Who knows the story? - Of Benny's girlfriend? Three years ago? She was holding the cake... and then... All of her hair... Burned. Ok, let's do a test... Just put it away then... Make a wish! Make a wish! Ok, ok. I don't know what. Can someone please turn on the light? Not that one! Not that one! Please. Turn this off. Is someone sleeping in your bed? - Not that I know of... - Hello? But what is this? A brown box sleeping in your bed? - Who might this be for? - For maestro. Thank you. Kara, help me out. - Ok, shall I open it? - Sure, open it. Tear it open. With your teeth.. A long, long way to go. What might it be inside? You can do it, you can do it! Wait... wait, not yet... Look at that! So... Nothing. What the fuck? - It's not nothing. - It's something symbolic. It's a metaphor, Övünç! A metaphor? Meaning what? Life is shit? No, no... "The journey is the reward "... Let's have a drink. - Sure. - Let's toast! By the way, that hat, it really suits you. - Good huh? - It's perfect. To the best age, to the best person. Another one, another present. No man, thanks. I'm good... Another one... another present! Another present, come on! A present for all of us. For us, for you, from me. - Another one. - Ok, then... Well then, I'll be reading the following to you... just to make you think a little. "Miranda92" posted online, on the internet forum: "www-good-question-dot-net", Listen up: "Yesterday we had a family reunion, with all my relatives together, and I had a conversation with my uncle, about the question, if we can influence our own destiny, or if everything is already predefined. He said... that every single one of us... has an expiration date. And from that certain point on, we cannot influence our lives anymore. I completely disagreed with that. I think, that of course we all know, that one day we're going to die, but we still can define what happens in our life. However, his words frightened me a bit... because if it's like he says, it wouldn't matter... If I study for school or if I don't. If in the end, I don't pass the exam. Because it was, let's say... "meant to be". Or not? Authentic quote! And then, she says: What you think about it? What do you think about it? Cheers! What exactly do you mean by "expiration date"? Henner, what do you mean by "expiration date"? Do you want champagne, Kara? Did you invite someone else? - Who is it? - Who's coming? - Anja! - Hey Övünç! - How are you? - Fine, how are you? - Great! So, happy birthday! Is it still? Great! - Thanks. - Come in. - No, no. Wait a second. I prepared something for you... It's small, but from the heart. Wait... That's the best present I ever got... Guys, this is Anja. Have a seat. Right here? Yummy! A birthday cake is the best! - Raha made it. - Nice. I made it together with Kara. You want some? Maybe a drink first. Which drink do you want? I'll take a beer... Cheers! Should we take one big cab? No, let's take two cabs... Hurry up, one cab is waiting down there... Did you already ordered another one? Shit, I forgot something. Be right there. I'll wait here for you. Do you want to take the elevator? Sure. Let's go! Pascal, you go with them... One cab is here, there should be another one. See you there. To Twinpigs, please. Look what I brought! Oh wow, one of the great old cameras. Let's do it! Let's first take a picture of the two of us. Damn, I wiggled! Let's take another one! Wait... Wait! Come on, you look great. Maybe like that? Yes, very nice, very nice... Wait... wait! With flash, right? Yup... Nice, really nice. I think I blinked. - Another one? - Yes please. Maybe a bit more serious? Wait, wait... What about my earrings? Leave them on? Easy, it's all good. Wait, wait... Wait, wait... Here is a great idea, I close my eyes, and on the count of three, you push the button and I open my eyes then. 3 -2 -1... You didn't count!?! Oh, I have to count? Sure, you count and I pose. - Are you ready? - Yes. Pascal, are you ready? 3-2-1.. - And, was it good? - It was, wasn't it? Best trick ever, isn't it?! So let's now take another one with the two of us! Yes, please. Wait, a quick makeup check... How many picture are still left? - There are plenty left. - Ok then I'll take one. You turn the wheel, wait till the light is red... Like that, right? - Shit! - What happened? - I closed my eyes again. - You have to turn the wheel again. Turn the wheel here... Ok, on the count of three again. This time it was me looking kind of weird. Fix my hair, yours too. - How do I look? - Quite ok. - Only "quite ok"? - You look damn good! Man, I'm blind now. Quite a flash, right? Did we bring something to drink? We'll be there in a minute. One last picture! Of the cab driver... Oh, look, here we are! - Let's go. - Wait, my bag. How much is it? Ten. What's the matter? We should go out... - What's the matter? - Let's go somewhere else... - Where shall we go then? - I don't get it, we just arrived here? - Let's go somewhere else... - But why are we leaving? Let's move on. What am I supposed to do with a television now? - Take it, take it! - Weren't you wishing for a TV? - A birthday present for you! - Ok, then. Hand it over, so we can move on. - Övünç, so where are we going now? - I don't know yet. OK. Bye bye now! Ok guys, let's head to "Schiefe Bahn" then. We'll take two cabs then, like before. - Where to now? - To "Schiefe Bahn". - Kara, you know where it is. - Yes. - You take one cab. - We take another one. - See you there then. - See you. Henner, can you please close that window. It's freezing. Did you see who was sitting back there in Twinpigs? Who was? Well... Me neither, that's why I'm asking you. I don't know, I didn't see anyone. I think, it was that Christina. I'm pretty sure it was her. Man, she didn't even say hi to him... This is so nice! - Wait, Övünç is calling me. - Why doesn't he call me? Yes, we'll be there any minute! Oh, I see. Ok, see you there! What's the matter? The bar is closed. They are waiting for us at "Karl Marx Platz". I see. Damn. So what now? - No idea. - He said we'll walk somewhere. You can drop us right here. - No, keep on driving! Keep on driving! - No, we'll get out now. Everyone's waiting for us. Guys! Let's smoke a joint. - It's your birthday! - Right... And this is my birthday spliff... So, if it's somebody's birthday, you have to do something special! - Correct! - Well... Because doing something special on your birthday, is a prediction for the rest of your new year! We are already doing something special?! - No, Övünç, I mean it. - Seriously? - Let Honey have it first. - Then she'll get something special! - No thanks. - Come on. We are all dying for "something special". Wow, now she's losing it. Ok. let's go to "Herz" now. Ok! Go! It's Övünç's Birthday today! Go! Go! Go! It's Övünç's Birthday today! Come on over, Kara! Can't we just walk normally? Keep on moving! Lets' go! Even faster! They say cancer is going to destroy humanity... But I think loneliness will. Pascal, let's move on. Pascal, let's go! What was up with that chick? Did she want to get it on? No man. What did she say? - Don't know. - Something about cancer... What? Something about cancer. Shit... Man, this place is packed... Yeah, right. Are you waiting for Anja? - Pardon? - I said, are you waiting for Anja? No. Why? Well, because she's running after you the whole night. Well, now she's obviously running after someone else. That's the way it is... You know what's funny? You, being so jealous. - Jealous?!? Me? - Yes. I just notice stuff like that... Anyways. Where's everybody else? Don't know... I saw Raha... You know what... Somehow... You have a lighter? You know, when I'm with you... I like that you're so calm and serene. Pardon? You carry this calmness... and sereness... that makes one feel good around you... Thanks, thanks, thank you... that's very kind of you, thank you. - But you see... - I don't just mean only you... I mean also because of what's between us... I always had the feeling there's something like... I don't know... some kind of connection... A very deep connection between you and me. You know what I mean? - Actually no... - I don't know what you mean. But... I mean... You know... Don't you get it...? Get what? Kara, I think we had a little too much to drink... What? I think we're a bit drunk... No... But wait... I mean... I just wanted to say that... I really had the feeling, there is something special between us, you know... Listen, Kara... I can't feel anything... Don't you get it?! I don't feel nothing... I don't even feel pain anymore, can you imagine that? Övünç, I am so sorry, but that is none of my business. Man, you have no idea... Hello?! Raha? I've been looking everywhere for you... You are hurting me! No, you stay here!! It was too muggy inside, I'll get the others. But I wanted to talk to you about... Which keys?! There's a fabulous party just around the corner! - What did he want from you? - Nothing. - What were you talking about? - Nothing, just small talk. - Did he say something about me? - Bullshit. - So, where's that party? - This way. - An elevator? - Well... - Shall we do some? - Yeah. Not for me. Wait right here then. Don't go in yet! Ok? Come on, easy, man. - Övünc leave him alone! - Hey man, it's all good. There is nothing wrong with him. Nothing happened to him... - Henner, what happened? - Easy guys, relax! - He is fine. - He just needs a moment. Just let him get some fresh air, for gods sake. Calm down, guys. - But what happened? - Nothing, he might be bit drunk. - He was a bit lost. - Down there? Yes, down there. I mean, you should know better, it seems that you've been hanging out with him. I don't actually know him... Henner, look at me! Are you hurt? What happened to you? Come on, look at me. What happened, tell me. Man, chill! Calm down. Come on, let's just go! Let's go somewhere else! We're going home now, man! - We won't go home! - We are not going home now! We won't go home, it's your birthday! - He's right! - I'll take you to another party. Let's celebrate, it's your birthday! Come on, I'll pay the cab. What's your name? - What's your name, man? - Övünç. - Ok, Övünç. - I'll take you somewhere nice. Let me get a cab. I'm fine... I'm just fine. You want some? No thanks. Back in the days, after five beers, all I really wanted was to be doing a line. Today, after five beers, all I really want is to get married. - Are you good? - Yupp, great. Sure? Yes! I am great, let go of the fucking door now! Are you fucking crazy? Why are you holding the door? What's your motherfucking problem? Do you have any idea how disgusting you are? You're so disgusting! The whole night long you really have been pissing me off... I mean, just look at that fucking outfit... Dressed like a freaking tiger, or what?! What's your fucking problem? Don't look at me like that... All night long with that stupid smile on your face... bouncing around... You had a great time tonight, didn't you? Such a great night tonight! Why are you standing here? Go back to the others, back to bouncing around... With your funky little bun up there... How it wiggles when you dance... as you're already very aware of, right? Let's shake that head a little more, let's look even more stupid and naive, right? All women should be ashamed for people like you! It should be required to raise awareness on this once a week. You should be displayed on television or something like that.. Do you even think at all? Oh no, I'm sorry, thinking is not your strong point, right? Hey, why don't you look at me? Look at me! You've got a fucking problem or what?! I said, look at me! Hello?! I said, look at me! Fuck. Fuck it. Should I vomit in your face? Should I? Then you have a real problem. You need that. Don't you? Why won't you look at me? Why are you still standing here? What the hell? Shit... It's all gonna be fine. Everything will be fine. I can't do it anymore... I can't do it anymore... It's all gonna be fine. When? I don't know... Soon. There will come a time, when everybody will know why, what all this suffering is for... Until then we must live. It's autumn now, soon it will be winter, the snow will cover everything. Is that the subway station "Wedding"? I don't want to go home, guys.
