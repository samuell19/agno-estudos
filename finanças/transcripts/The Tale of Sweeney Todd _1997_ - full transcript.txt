Is that the last?Yes, Mr. Mannheim. Let not your fingers be weary, gentlemen. I shall return in an hour. The Dutch consignment is to be finished by then. Of course, Mr. Mannheim. Send out your broken chairs! Chairs to mend! 'Morning, Mr. Mannheim.Good morning. Send out your broken chairs! Chairs to mend! Get your lovely hot pies here, everybody! Make way, sir. Make way. Disgusting! Don't you worry, sir, we all go shit-shod here. No! No! You there, you! Thought it was your job to catch thieves! Lovett's pies! My wall, I think. Lovett's pies! Ladies, 'morning. Come and get one of her specials! Like a pie, sir?No, no, no. I want to go down there. I want to go down with her. You know, there are some of them that are so patriotic, they won't even do a French dance at all. But am I gonna let Napoleon stop me doing the devot? I don't think so! Arm around her waist, sir. That's the way they do it in Germany, and their excuse is-- and a good, scientific excuse it is too, sir, for a waltzing man like yourself-- that you need an intimate hold if the pair of you aren't to fall down during the turns. Look at you, sir. The ladies will faint dead away, sir, I promise you. Can't see a dashed thing. Scarcely worth the botheration, dashed horsehair. It's not horse, sir, but the virgin hair of Polish nuns, sir, washed in the pure waters of the river vistula. Come in, sir, and take your ease. I'll keep you but a moment. Charlie, boy, show the gentleman to the bench and, um, offer him the newspaper or fetch him a glass of Porter if he'd like it. I'm in a hurry. I'm nearly done with this gentleman, sir. Be with you directly, sir. Yes. Boy, get the gentleman lathered up. How do you find it, sir? It doesn't sit right. Pull it down at the back, sir. It'll be as snug as a duck in a ditch! No, no, no! I beg your pardon, sir, he hasn't been with me long. He has a lot to learn, haven't you, Charlie? But learn it he will, if I have anything to do with it. I shall be with you, sir, before that lather's let its breath out. Now... Sir. Aah! You'll eat a whole cow with those now, sir, from horn to hoof. Her ladyship expects these in the morning, and I'm to tell you that if they don't keep better in curl, you may whistle for your account. Really, Mr. Todd, one's life is not safe here! Always glad to be of service, sir. Your most obedient. Good day, Mr. Todd. And now, sir, if you would be good enough to step up to my chair, sir. Charlie? Let's have the floor cleaned up, Charlie. No, no, no. Cut along to the temple with that wig for, um, Mr. Justice green. Look sharp now! And how has your day been, sir? Is the war treating you well? Well, just so, sir. Yes, sir. And, what line of business--? That is no concern of yours. Spare me the chatter. Get on with my shave. So that's easy, ladies. One on each arm? Easy? You wanted company, sir? No. Come now, sir, you gave me the nod. Come. You will enjoy it. I promise you that. Show me. Wait. Yes? I thought I told you. The gentleman invited me.Out. I haven't done nothin'.You've stolen enough in the past. Get your hands off me!Give me that! Who d'you think you are? I haven't done nothin'! Next time, sir, I'd advise a little more care in your choice of partner. Thanks. You've got no choice-- you are now part of his majesty's Navy! My wife, sir!Never mind about her! I've got children! You will serve on his magnificent ships. You don't need me, sir! Let go of him! You're in the Navy now! I'll be back! May we be of assistance, sir? Mannheim?mr. Mannheim is unavailable at present. Where is he? Is he upstairs? Like I said--leave this to me. Sir! Sir! I say, sir, you can't go up there, sir! Sir, come back here, sir! Sir! I say, sir... Sir! Sir, you can't go--! Sir, I protest! Knowler, fetch a runner. Sir, you've no business here. I must ask you to leave at once. Here's my business. For $50,000? Signed by mannheim. So where are the diamonds? Diamonds. My employers have waited six months. They want their goods or their money. I'm sure that in due course... Stop. Where's mannheim? We are expecting... um... Well, the war makes traveling so hazardous. Mr. Mannheim's not been seen the last five weeks. Vanished off the face of the earth. That will do, knowler! Get back to your desk. Now, sir, I beg of you-- you have a key for this? Those are Mr. Mannheim's private-- sir, i-- i-i-i beg you, sir-- please be quiet. Mr. Mannheim had the only key, sir... And he kept it on his person at all times.Knowler! On a chain. You know a good picklock? This is a highly respected establishment. Well, do you? Downstairs, knowler. I told you before. I'm at the saracen's head. Well, see him out! Now, Tony, I want 'em off the tray before the gravy's cooled, all right? 'Morning, Mrs. Lovett!Hello, Toby. Now, I don't want none of these coming back, all right, darling? You know me, ma'am. Best pie man in town. I do. Bill, here we are. I've got some rabbit specials for you. Take 'em down the strand. They enjoy rabbit down the strand. All right, dear? Joe, nice to see you. Got over your pneumonia, then, have you? Mary, take these two specials to Mr. Todd, the barber. Here we are, dear. You get 'em off. Got those round the temple, all right, dear? Nice to see you, darling. Here, more flour. Get your hand out the flour. I'm coming down! Quick! No more salt! We have oysters enough for that! More flour! Let me see. That'll do, that'll do. Thin! Thin! I want those thin as the lid on a pauper's coffin, not--! All right, Mrs. Lovett. Billy! Hurry up, boy. No slacking, you little drab! Grind on! Billy! Go on, boy! No slacking! You burn those pies, I'll cut your hands off! Can I get you anything else, sir? Sure? Okay, then. On our own tonight, Mr. Carlyle? For reasons of health, I trust. I prefer my own company, miss. I shouldn't bother with those. Full of nonsense, they are. Don't believe what you read? I don't have time for reading. I pick up news from my customers. And you believe them? That depends. On? Whether they have an honest face or not. Judge people by their looks, do you? And their actions, Mr. Carlyle, when they're worth noticing. Excuse me, sir. We met at Mr. Mannheim's. Tom knowler, Tom to me friends. And what may I call you? What can you do for me? I can help, sir. I thought the way you handled our head clerk-- what help can you give? Well, I'm a londoner, sir, born and bred. If anyone can find his way around this city while letting American gentlemen like yourself into its secrets-- you know what's happened to mannheim? Well, not exactly, sir. Nobody does. Would he have sold those diamonds to somebody else? Not mannheim. I mean, he was an old miser, but-- so where are they? If they're anywhere, sir, they'd be in his safe. You know how to get into it? Not personally, sir, no, but... Then you're no use to me. No, no, I mean, I might be able to get my hands on a picklock, sir. Definitely. I could definitely get me hands on one... But it's gonna cost a bit of money. I've a wife and a little girl, sir. None of us knows what the future holds, do we? What is your name again? Tom. Tom. Well, Tom, you find a picklock and he gets into the safe, he gets paid. You too. Farewell. Miraculous organ, the tongue, Charlie. It can tell beef from mutton, quince from apple, suet from semolina, and yet it's only attached by a few little tendons. A blabbing tongue is easy to tear out by the roots, Charlie. Aren't you glad yours will never blab? Get out of here! Move yourself! Rutledge? All the game I've given you-- none of it worth a dodging! Inside! Rutledge? Major Rutledge to you. Major, sir. What do you want? I'm looking for a merchant that's disappeared. Man named mannheim. Merchants go missing all the time. Well, this one's gone missing with $50,000 worth of diamonds. And are they yours? My employers'. So you're hoping for the reward. Rewards are what my men live on. Why should I help you and harm their pockets? I thought it was your job. People like mannheim always do well out of wars. And if he slipped through our naval blockade-- you mean he could be in France. It's possible. A judicious bribe, a tidy profit. Major Rutledge! This man's confessed!Very good, Davis! Well, I can see you're busy solving other important crimes. I'll leave you to it. Just a minute. Davis! You saw that fellow mannheim, the jeweler, the night before he was reported missing. Fleet street, wasn't it? Mannheim? Yes, I did, sir. Well, there, Mr. Carlyle. Don't say the runners aren't a mine of information. Aaahhh! Aaaaahhhhh! There you are, vicar! The ache'll soon go, just like people's good intentions! I am most grateful to you. I shall offer up thanks for the skills you have been granted. Not granted, vicar, so much as acquired, in the African jungles, sir, where, to survive, a man must do things that civilized beings daren't dream of. Well, I'm sure, Mr. Todd, that you... ...have always behaved in a Christian manner. I mean, you're an example to us all of Christian charity, taking in dumb orphans and turning them into decent citizens. Thank you so much. Good boy. Thank you. Just a moment. Just a moment, here. There now. That's for you. There we are. Put it in there, sir. There are those in more need than I. You really are so good. There we go. Now. There we go. There we go. Thank you very much. Very kind of you. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Harder! Harder! Yeah, that's it! Yeah! Come on, damn you, harder! Harder, bitch, harder! Yes. Come on. Come on, damn you! Yes! Yes! Your servant, Mrs. Lovett. And yours, major Rutledge. Todd! I trust I find you well, major Rutledge. In fighting form.Yes, yes. I bid you good day. Yes. Yes. And you, Mrs. Lovett, what form are you in? In firkytoodling form, Mr. Todd. Born in a barn, Mr. Carlyle? Aren't you gonna close the door? Not with you on this side of it, miss Alice. Am I so frightening? You're many things. Frightening's not one of them. But right now, I don't need distractions. I see. You'll dally with trollops and drink with drabs. No, let me say that again. The man that pays you attention needs to do it right. I wouldn't want to get it wrong. And how does one learn right and wrong, except by experiment? Experiments conducted in haste are bound to disappoint. Well, then, Mr. Carlyle, we shall have to wait till we are less distracted, shan't we? This is the man, sir. Prince among picklocks. Really? - Got it? - Nearly. How's he gonna open a safe if he can't open a door? How you gonna open the safe when you can't even open a door? You never said anything about doors. You're a picklock, ain't ya? Shh! First time in London, Mr. Carlyle? Yes. Enjoying yourself?What is your name again? Tom. Tom, I don't like towns, Tom, this one in particular, and I don't like the British. I'm with you there. Any particular reason? Yeah. They shot my father. Yeah, mine too. There! Well? It'll take a while.It's a new one. I know that.The old one would open on a fart. This one might need gunpowder. Just hurry it up, gentlemen.It can't be hurried. Seein' her again tonight. Great. Hey, look up there. You said to me you could do it, chambers. I can do it. I just need some time. Shut! We've just run out of that. What? We've got company. Is there a back way out? You useless slubberdegullion! This way, Mr. Carlyle! This way, this way, quickly! You stay here. No, no, no. Come on, let's go! Hey, you, stop! Mr. Carlyle! Mr. Carlyle! Come on, you. 'Afternoon. 'Afternoon. I was wondering if you could help me. I'm looking for a man. This is what he looks like. Have you seen him? No. No, never seen him before. No. Haven't seen him. You're sure? Yes. All right, thank you. Come on, now, be a man. The rum'll kill you before this will, and that's the truth. When I was in Africa on his majesty's service, I sewed on a finger snatched from the jaws of a lion, and the trooper's sitting there chatting with me as if I'm doing no more than filing his nails. And what's more...Aaahhh! Alice!! What's this? I don't see you for weeks on end, and in you burst to put me wigs and whiskers all out of a curl. How are you? Where have you been? I thought you'd forgotten your sweeney! Never, Mr. Todd!There's women for you, sir. Here, look, I'll pay you tomorrow, all right? "All roight!" Will you care to step out to my chair, sir? And, Charlie, make some tea for miss Alice. Quickly, now, or she'll be off before we learn her excuses. I have no secrets from you, Mr. Todd, or from Charlie, either. So what is it, Alice? You're not gonna break my poor old heart by telling me you're in love with another. Well... If you must know, there is a... An American gentleman. An American gentleman? I was not aware any such creature existed, were you, sir? Is not such a thing a contradiction in terms? Mr. Todd, you-- Miss Alice. Mr. Carlyle. Um, this is my guardian, Mr. Sweeney Todd. Mr. Carlyle. Take a seat. I shall be with you directly. Thank you. Um... I only came to... Get your hair cut, surely. Mr. Todd does that better than any man in London. I'm not sure I need that, but I'll take your word for it. Listen, um, you know him? No, no, but I'm sorry for any man with a face that would curdle milk! Who is he? He's a merchant I'm keen to talk to. Well, perhaps Mr. Todd could help you. He counts many merchants among his clients, don't you, Mr. Todd? Well, I have to go now. Um... Yes. Good day to you, Mr. Carlyle. And... Good luck. So, how can I help you, Mr. Carlyle? Sir, I'm looking for a man last seen down here in fleet street, a fellow named mannheim. Diamond merchant. Do you see how talk of diamonds makes a poor barber's hand tremble? I'm sorry. I shall put some alum on it directly. Charlie? Where's that boy got to? So the name means nothing?Allow me to confess something to you, sir-- names mean very little to me. So many people have sat in this chair. Faces, now, are different. When you run your fingers over a man's face, it's like a chart, sir, of every feature, good and bad. What about this? I'm sure I'd recollect a face like that, sir. Who wouldn't? Well, may I, leave it here with you, in case it jogs someone else's memory?Of course, sir. Over here?Of course. And what, may I ask, is your business with this gentleman? Well, he has something I want, something I intend to get. Well, I look forward to hearing all about it, Mr. Carlyle, when I have you in my chair. Some alum, Charlie, directly. Don't dawdle, boy. Some alum for the gentleman. Well, I think I'll have that haircut another time, if you'll excuse me. Thanks for your help. I'll call on you again. I trust so, Mr. Carlyle, or you shall have me to answer to-- never mind young Alice. I'm not ashamed. When it comes to sending men to their deaths, I'm nothing. The least politician condemns whole peoples with the stroke of a pen. The newest of generals, he kills more men than the worst of murderers, then he has his statue erected by public subscription. The meanest of bloody merchants destroys whole families in the name of profit, then he's made a lord. They have no conscience, why should I? I just say enough is enough, Mr. Todd. You've had enough of me, have you, Mrs. Lovett? Not of you, Mr. Todd. Of our work. Of firkytoodling customers and firkytoodling carcasses! God knows they deserve each other. But between 'em, they've given us everything we ever wanted. I just say stop now, before we get dragged back down into that pit it's taken us so long to crawl out of. And if we stopped, Mrs. Lovett, what then? Why, then, Mr. Todd, we should lead lives of comfortable ease. Ha ha ha! Come here. Not afraid of me, are you, Mrs. Lovett? What's there to be afraid of, Mr. Todd, when I have you as my protector? Remember not, lord, our offenses, nor the offenses of our forefathers, neither take thou vengeance of our sins. Spare us, good lord. Spare thy people whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious blood and be not angry with us forever. Spare us, good lord, from the crafts and assaults of the devil. They should look at those drains. Worse than forgotten. From thy wrath and from everlasting damnation... Good lord, deliver us. Lord, deliver us. From fornication and all other deadly sins, and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil, good lord... Good lord, deliver us. From lightning and tempest, from plague, pestilence, and famine, from battle and murder, and from sudden death, good lord... Good lord, deliver us. From all sedition, privy conspiracy, and rebellion, from all false doctrine, heresy, and schism, from hardness of heart and contempt of thy word the commandment. Good lord, deliver us. By the mystery of the holy incarnation, by the holy nativity and circumcision, by the baptism, fasting, and temptation... Good lord, deliver us. Here we are, then, dear. Lovely. Good. No firkytoodling! You've got four minutes, then you're back to work! That pie man-- you know that pie man? Here, have a puff. Do you good. It's Charlie. Did Mr. Todd do that to you? Old Mrs. Lovett's done the same to me more than once, and for nothing, neither. But that's how it is, Charlie. What is it, Charlie? Over here. Who is it, Charlie? Someone Mr. Todd shaved? And you want to claim the reward? You want me to go to Mr. Carlyle at the saracen's head. But why don't you come with me? All right, Charlie, I'll go and see him, but don't count on a reward. And just remember-- one more foot wrong, and Mr. Todd will send you straight back to the asylum. It's all right. Don't you worry. I'll look after you. We'll sort it out. Turned into a right little gossip, haven't you? Not as dumb as you'd like us to think. Go on. Go on. Go on. Whoa. Whoa. Cut it myself. I'd know it anywhere. Mr. Mannheim wore it always. Does this mean, major Rutledge, that you're near to discovering what has happened to him? Is there no way of opening this thing? Mr. Mannheim has the only key. He's dead. How do you know? Deduction. The ring was found on the body of a fence, a person well-known to us who handles stolen goods. When we discovered him, he'd been beaten and robbed of all but this, which he'd hidden in his boot. You say mannheim wore it and disappeared. It turns up on a dead fence-- ergo, mannheim was the first to be killed for it. Well, gentlemen, I have several picklocks who'd be happy to try their skills on that. Major Rutledge, we couldn't possibly-- whoever finds the diamonds that American's looking for gets the reward. Think about it. Hey!let go of me! Get out. I've already told you, I don't want you coming here bothering my customers. This is no place for a girl like you. What do you want? I've come to see Mr. Carlyle. From Mr. Carlyle, you say? Expecting you, is he?No. Well, this way. You have a visitor. Watch your step. Half the Navy's after her. Would you like a drink?A port, thank you. Something for you, miss? Thank you. Maybe later. Sit down. I'm Ben. Lucy. All right, Lucy, you know mannheim? I have a friend. Charlie his name is. He works for Mr. Todd, the barber in fleet street, opposite Mrs. Lovett's. Charlie says-- well, he doesn't say because he can't talk properly. Hasn't done since he was a child, though I understand him well enough, his signs and little noises. Good as an actor, he is. Thank you, sir.You're welcome. Slow down, girl. There's no need to rush with Mr. Carlyle. So, what connects your friend Charlie to this man? Well, sir, Charlie says he remembers lathering him... One evening back in September.God, what now...? Tom. Tom. Just wondered if you knew the runners found mannheim's ring, and, well, they think he's dead. Well, this young lady may help us there. My friend Charlie, he thinks he knows what's happened to the gentleman. 'Course, he may have got it wrong. Well... let's go see him. Well, you can't go now, sir. He'd be asleep. You'd wake Mr. Todd, and he wouldn't like that. As a matter of fact, I ought to be going myself. It's ever so late. Tomorrow, then?If you can catch him when he's free, sir. I wouldn't want him to get into any more trouble. Allow me, Mr. Carlyle. I'll see this lady home safe. There's no need.Of course there is. Ma'am. What's this?Business to settle over here. You owe me, for me time and trouble. Is this gentleman bothering you? I was just going to show him the door. Well, allow me. Aah! Better help him through it.Time to leave. I'm a professional picklock. I don't care what you've picked! He hired me to open a safe for him! You're bothering my customers! 'Course, he don't go about things the way we do, him being an American, but I don't hold that against him. I just want to show him that, well, that maybe our way's better. So if you can bring me and your friend Charlie together, say, tomorrow night after I've done with work...? It might not be that easy, sir. Worth a try, isn't it? We won't get anywhere without trying. Easy. Easy, now. Spot of London weather, Mr. Carlyle. Come for that haircut? I daresay I can fit you in somehow. Let's get this coat dried off. Straightaway. Straight... away. Please. Just the cut, I think, Mr. Todd. Indulge me, Mr. Carlyle! A shave at my hands is a tonic that will not injure your wallet, I promise you that. Wet through. It's a task you usually leave to your apprentice? Yeah, you mean Charlie? Now, there's a sad tale to be told, Mr. Carlyle, a sad tale indeed. Tell me. Well, an orphan boy, sir, who knew little of human kindness till he came into my care. Never been known to speak an intelligible word to a living soul, sir, and do you know why? According to the superintendent of the asylum where I found him, he witnessed sights that robbed him of the power of speech-- a plight, I might add, that instantly drew him to me. You a sentimental man, Mr. Todd? I am, sir. I am indeed. I have witnessed sights that I would prefer to remain dumb about, though, as you have no doubt observed, Mr. Carlyle, I'm not a man to whom silence comes naturally. I imagine we all see and do things we'd rather forget. Have you ever known-- can you ever imagine what it is to starve, Mr. Carlyle? I've gone hungry.And what did you do to fill your belly? Nothing I'm proud of. How 'bout you? In Africa, sir, when my friend and I were caught between starvation and the Spears of savages, when desperation made us forget we were human... Did you kill? Mr. Carlyle... If only it were that easy. So, where is Charlie? Um, I, I had to let Charlie go, sir. He was getting into bad habits. Where would he go?Be still, Mr. Carlyle. I would not like an accident to befall you. Why should an accident befall me, Mr. Todd? London's a dangerous place, Mr. Carlyle. Surely you've learnt that in your short stay among us. So, what am I gonna do with you, Charlie? Mrs. Lovett wants you dead and your body disposed of the way we disposed of her husband all those years ago, but I don't see the need for that, do you? I'm fond of you, Charlie, and that's the truth. I can talk to you without having to listen to all your problems, as I listen to half the world's. You're just like a dog, aren't you, Charlie, only more useful. That is, until you started misbehaving, Charlie. Now, why did you do that, I wonder? Was it because I was too kind to you? Do you know what we do to dogs who misbehave? You do, don't you, Charlie? We beat them... And then we chain them up and we starve them... Until they know better. Don't we, Charlie? Where's your friend Charlie? I haven't seen him, not a sign. I don't know what's happened to him. I haven't seen him for two days now. I just don't know what's happened. Well, I'll try Mr. Todd, then. I wouldn't do that, sir. Shh. It's all right, miss. If these chunks are too hot, you'll burn my wigs. If they're too cold, my wigs won't curl. Are you listening, boy? There, take those. Forgive me, sir. I was taking advantage of a quiet moment to teach my new lad here some of the tricks of the trade. Come in, make yourself easy. Boy, take the gentleman's coat. Never mind all that, Mr. Todd. I've come to talk, about my late employer. I mean Mr. Mannheim, Mr. Todd, a name I take it rings a bell. That'll do for now, boy. I'll see to this gentleman myself. You take yourself off to 195 piccadilly, and collect milady's evening wig for curling. Go on. Off you go. Now, sir, let's have that talk. May I offer you a shave while we do so, sir? I-I find I talk better while I'm working, sir, and I'm sure you'll find it most relaxing. You can't trick me, Mr. Todd. I know what you've done. Do you indeed? What would that be? I can put two and two together. You killed old mannheim. Did you slit his throat, Mr. Todd? If you'll forgive me, sir, I'll take a seat. Not there, Mr. Todd, if you please. Over there by the fire, where I can keep an eye on you. Certainly, sir, certainly. Whatever you say. Now, then. Mannheim doesn't concern me. You've rid the world of yet another skinflint, and I, for one, shall not waste time mourning his passing. However, his diamonds... Diamonds, sir?Come now, Mr. Todd. His big ring alone was worth a small fortune. That, sadly, is now in the hands of the runners, but you, you must have the key to his safe. I want iti assure you, sir-- I want it now, Mr. Todd. A particular friend of mine is interested in the diamonds in that safe. The head clerk's been trying every which way to open it, but only the key will answer. And if you do not give me the key at once, the runners will know before the day is out who killed Mr. Mannheim, 'cause I'll see to that meself. And if I do give you the key. That'd be good enough for me and my friend. Let the runners pursue their investigations as they will. That is their job, not mine. Well, sir, since you leave me no choice. Where are you off to?Just off to my cellar, sir. Well, I'll accompany you.Well, you shall indeed, sir. But first let me fetch my lantern, sir, to light our way. It's just in my parlor, sir, behind this curtain. I shall not leave your sight, sir. Do not trouble yourself. You see me now, sir, do you not? I hear you, Mr. Todd, but I do not see you. I'm on my way back to you now, sir. The lantern is in my hand. You see it, sir, do you not? Yes, I see it, Mr. Todd. Aaahhhh! Rutledge. Rutledge, what's going on? Find your diamonds yet? No, have you? Hey-ho, Halloween! Hey-ho, Halloween! All the witches to be seen! We've had this dreadful smell here for weeks. I've told you, major Rutledge. My runners will get to the bottom of it, vicar, never fear. Come on, vicar. Dear god. How long do you think they've been here? Now, there's no need to push all at once. One at a time, please. There we are. There's enough here to satisfy even the most demanding customers, isn't there, sir? Excuse me, madam, making inquiries about the human remains found in the graveyard. Yes, do you know anything? Are you sure? Sell me your pies, please? Yes, what is it? Special for his imminence? He's got over that little problem, has he? He's fine.Good. I'm so glad. I'm so pleased, 'cause that can be so messy. Here you are, my dear. That's it. Yes. And there was this man called Tom... All right, boys, one at a time. ...In the middle articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid and behind with the orbital process of the palate bone, bounded externally by a smooth, rounded edge, which enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fissure, and which sometimes articulates at its anterior extremity with the orbital... Well, gentlemen! Here is an interesting conundrum-- a collection of human bones expertly butchered, with the flesh, I would hazard, boiled off, belonging, in my opinion, to at least five different men, of whom three were in their middle years, and all of them found, as no doubt you've been made aware by the sensational stories already circulating in the crypt of St. dunstan's in fleet street. Sit, major. Am I disturbing you? I beg your pardon. So, what are we looking for, gentlemen? A thief, certainly. Note the fingers, severed from the hands-- a common practice to make it easier to steal the victim's rings. We are looking at the work of someone expert in the art of deception as well as dissimulation, someone callous and calculating enough to confuse his pursuers by jumbling up the bones of his victims, knowing that would make identification impossible-- someone clever as well as depraved, gentlemen, and we all know, do we not, how fluid is the dividing line between cleverness and depravity. I declare, Mr. Todd, you are getting quite careless. First the business of the diamond ring, then your boy Charlie, then these bones. Now I find that little chit Lucy's been talking to the firkytoodling runners. I thought you looked after the firkytoodling runners, Mrs. Lovett. I mind my end of the business, Mr. Todd. Can you say the same of yours? You don't mean-- Sorry. There is no room for doubt between partners. I just hope you're not too distracted to abide by the terms of our agreement. You know I'm never distracted, Mrs. Lovett. I'm glad to hear it. You will take care of Lucy, then? You may count on it. What? You may count on it. Listen, you forgot... Excuse me. Excuse me. ...Mrs. Lovett's famous pies. Get your pies here! That's a nice pie, sir, a nice, hot pie. Right. Get your pies here, everybody. Hello. Hi, dearie. Get yourself a nice pie. Here you are. Mrs. Lovett's famous pies. Get your pies here. Mrs. Lovett's pies! Mrs. Lovett's pies! Get yours here! Mrs. Lovett's famous pies. Feast your eyes on those, sir. Feast your eyes on these lovely pies. Come on, get one of her specials, fresh-baked this morning! Don't all push at once. Thank you, dear, take that one. Thank you, madam, that's lovely. Quit shoving! Mrs. Lovett, I was hoping for a word with you. We all live in hope, sir. Which pie would you like? All of them.All of them?! Does your belly think your throat's been cut? Actually, I was hoping for a word in private. We might talk about a business venture I had in mind which might extend your fame a little further. Well, sir, we can speak as privately as you'd like. I would remind you, you are in a pie shop, not firkytoodling at a play! Have you come to laugh or to buy? Which is it to be? Take over, lil. This way, if you please, sir. Thank you.Watch 'em, lil. I want one of them venison ones. What a crowd! Always the same! This suet crust is the pie's crowning glory, as my late husband always used to... Mr. Carlyle? I'm sorry, I was just wondering how you arrange the delivery of the meat. I don't see any... Capital work, Jane, dear. Yes, this is a little invention of my own devising. It's simple, yet highly effective. It secures my supplies from thieves and similar riffraff. Is your curiosity quite satisfied, Mr. Carlyle? Yes, thank you, ma'am. That's very clever. This way, if you please. May I ask you a business question? What is it, exactly, that goes into your specials? The meat, I mean. I've seen veal and ham, beef, oysters, poultry, but what is that... Secret ingredient that makes your specials so popular? Ooh, wouldn't you like to know? Everybody, including the archbishop of canterbury, wants to know that. But, Mr. Carlyle, even if you and I do go into partnership in America-- an idea that interests me more and more-- my recipes must remain my own. They're all I have, sir. They will go with me to my grave. Do it properly, you little tyke, or I'll boil your head for soup! It's hopeless, sir, but, of course, there is a war on. Mrs. Lovett's pies? You wish me to analyze them? Why?does it matter? Well, if I don't know your purpose or what it is you're looking for, I can see no earthly reason why I should waste my valuable time... Could you come back in 24 hours? Ladies and gentlemen, we proudly present signor elini, the greatest juggler of knives to grace fleet street! Come on. Hang on, wait for me! Mary? Mary! ...Marat, killed by Charlotte corday! See the blood-thirsty horror, ladies and gentlemen-- the guillotine. Let's go. How 'bout this? Charlie! Drink up. Thank you. That poor girl. What a horrible thing to happen to her. What did she want with you the other night? She had some information for me. Yes. Your precious diamonds. I don't care about the diamonds, but I need the money they'll bring. So you can go straight back to America. Is that all you want? How'd you get this? I spent a few years as a guest of the state of Massachusetts. Why? Were you in prison? I killed a man. Why? My father was killed in the war. I was about 15, I think. After a while, there was a gentleman... Rented a room in our house. He spent some time with my sister. Against her will. You understand? My father was killed, in Africa. Soldier? They were-- they were together, he and Mr. Todd. The only ones to avoid capture. But my father, he was-- he was very badly wounded, and he wasn't strong enough to make their escape. And as he died, Mr. Todd promised him that he'd come back, find me, and look after me as his own. Does he? Look after you? Yes. No one better. We all need someone to look after us, don't we, Mr. Carlyle? I've always taken care of myself, miss Alice. I know. Whoa! Thank you, sir. Now, this is calf, sir. In my view, ayrshire, though my diligent assistant, not being of the Scottish persuasion, inclines towards friesian. Let's forget the breed, doctor. Well, the art of detection, Mr. Carlyle, lies in the detail. But let us proceed. This is pig, probably gloucester old spot. Then we have ox, lamb, um... Goose.yes, yes. Goose. Rabbit and pigeon. And this? On that, sir, we have reached no definite conclusion. You mean you don't know, or you won't say? Well, it-it's not beef, pig, or poultry, though it bears a certain resemblance to all three. You're sure it's an animal? I can't say for sure.If it's not an animal, what is it? That, Mr. Carlyle, is precisely the problem. So it could be human. My family and I often partake of Mrs. Lovett's pies. How do you think my wife and children would feel if they were told they were cannibals? What would London think? What would the world say of britain if its citizens were said to be eating one another? I'm an American, doctor, and you are, I assume a man of science. I would think that the truth-- the truth? Truth is a weapon like any other, Mr. Carlyle. A surgeon uses a knife to cure, a butcher to kill. I'll tell you about the truth, doctor. I come to a town that claims to be the center of civilization and find that merchants disappear rather than honor their contracts. The authorities, if you can call them that, are only interested in the rewards they can gather. I then discover that the man I came to find has in fact been robbed, cut up, and maybe even eaten, and you want me to be quiet about it? I didn't say that. Just give me a straight answer: Is this or is this not human flesh? It is possible. Thank you, doctor. I have heard-- and perhaps it is true-- that the taste for human flesh is addictive, that once enjoyed, no other meat gives the same gustatory satisfaction. You mean the killer is feeding some kind of craving? Cannibalism is a lot more common than we'd be prepared to admit. King Richard the lionheart told his crusaders that the most nourishing meat for an englishman was the head of a saracen. Starving soldiers and sailors have always-- wait. Soldiers-- in Africa, recently? In Africa. And elsewhere. Maybe even here. Thank you, doctor. Spare a copper for a loyal servant of the crown, sir? Thank you, sir, thank you. I should go with you. No. No, I'll tell him. Sure? I've done everything. I've risked everything. I would remind you that I have risked as much and worked as hard to get this far, and I say it is time to book our passage. You say!Yes, I say, Mr. Todd. Is my word not of equal value to yours? That depends on who you're speaking to. I'm speaking to you, Mr. Todd. But do not think that I shall hesitate to speak to others if I have to. You threaten me? There's no need for threats if you'd do as we agreed. I've already told you, the time is not yet right. I've already-- we have enough. What are we waiting for? Unless of course you plan to share the proceeds with someone else. Someone else? Nah, you're being-- We have business to finish, Mrs. Lovett. As far as I'm concerned, the business is over tomorrow. Mrs. Lovett, I know it's late. I'm here to see Mr. Todd. See who we have here, Mr. Todd? Isn't this a pleasant surprise? I had to come and tell you. I had to. What? Mrs. Lovett. Alice has come to tell us her news, Mr. Todd. Perhaps we have news for her too. But I know about you, Mrs. Lovett, you and Mr. Todd. What do you know, Alice? Do you think you could keep it a secret from me, when we have been so close? Alice, what do you know? Why, that the two of you are lovers. Mr. Todd, be happy for me too. Give us your blessing. Mr. Carlyle and I are... So, Mr. Todd, she does not know everything. What more is there to know? Will you tell her?No. Would you like me to do it?Never. Well, then, Mr. Todd, I suggest you go at once and book that passage we agreed on. There's a boat that leaves at high tide tomorrow. Boat? Mr. Todd...? And Alice will stay with me until we know the passage is secured. Stay here? But I have to work. I'm sure that if Mr. Todd insists you keep me company, you will not refuse him. Stay till the morning, Alice. Just till the morning. I shall be back for you. Yes, I shall be back. You keep her safe. I know her value, Mr. Todd. As if I'd do anything else. Now... a glass of Brandy, Alice dear? No?. Game of cards? No? Well, I should have something if I were you, dear. It could be a long, cold night. Go on! Go on! Open this door, anyone! Let me out! Go on! That's it! And there! Giddyup! Go on! Charlie? Charlie, is that you? Charlie, hold on. I'll come back for you, all right? Who's there? Is that you, Mr. Todd? No, no, no. Aah! Thank god it's you, Mr. Carlyle. I thought it was sweeney Todd. I've plenty of money put by, enough to go round. I don't want your money. He won't let her go, you know. I've three passages booked for America, leaving tonight-- you, me, and Alice. She begged me to help. Where is she? Is she here? I've entreated him to stop this. He's gone to far. I told him, but he wouldn't listen. He's so... So powerful, Mr. Carlyle. Sir, you must help us. Get me off this firkytoodling hook! Go on, then! Giddyup! Nasty-looking cuts there, Mr. Carlyle. You've not been fighting out of your league, I trust. You know why I'm here. Well, now, are you going to ask me for the hand of my ward in marriage and then, in the next breath, report me to the runners? That wouldn't make for the happiest of honeymoons, now, would it, Mr. Carlyle? Why don't you let me explain things to you in terms you'll understand? I think I know.You think you know?! Do you know what it's like to be abandoned in a jungle by officers too lazy and cowardly to search for you amongst savages? Listen, Todd, the English killed my father. And you don't want revenge? Shame on you. Not by killing innocent people. Was not I an innocent once, one like you and Alice? Leave her out of it. I love her, Mr. Carlyle, in a way that you'll never understand! Everything I've done, everything, has been for her. Could you do as much? Would you do as much? I don't think so! Alice wouldn't want this. What do you know about what Alice would or wouldn't want? I'll tell you what I want. I want the key to mannheim's safe. I want to see that boy Charlie safe and sound. He will never be that, Mr. Carlyle. Then I want to see you in the hands of the runners. And Alice? She'll never learn the truth from me. I'll take her away from here before you're arrested. You will take her from me? You will never do that, Mr. Carlyle, not while I have breath in my body. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Take her out! Come on! I don't know what you're arresting me for! It's that American you want! He attacked me in my own kitchen, he did! I'll never spank you again, major Rutledge! You'll never spank anyone where you're going, Mrs. Lovett! Take her away! Take her away! Come on, get going! Mr. Todd! Sweeney Todd! Well, now, Mr. Carlyle, come back to us, have you, at last? I was afraid I'd lost you there, sir, I was indeed, which would have been a great sadness to me, sir-- a sadness and a loss, not least to surgical science, for I propose to use you, Mr. Carlyle, for a little experiment. I was taught to experiment in the army, you see. You learn so much serving his majesty-- learn how much pain the human frame, or, more importantly, the human mind can take, learn how to avoid telling the one young woman who loves and trusts you... That you have eaten of her father's flesh. To business. Has it ever occurred to you, Mr. Carlyle, that the most inventive talents of any civilization were not devoted to buildings or irrigation or mundane matters of quotidian living, but to ways of putting to death their fellow men and women. For what do you remember the Spaniards? Burning people alive. The arabs? Death by a thousand cuts. The English? Hanging, drawing, and quartering. The aztecs, whose achievements are so... Greatly appreciated to the south of your own country? The cutting from the living body of the still-beating heart, an operation which your want of heart put me in mind of. An operation which I now propose to commence. No! Todd! Good boy, Charlie! Get my feet! Thank you, my friend! Charlie, what are you doing? What's this? Mannheim's keys? Good lad. Good lad, come on! Come on! What's going on? God! Mr. Todd! Please, somebody! Mister--! Let me through! Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! You mustn't go in there, miss! Mr. Todd! - Mr. Todd is in there! - Somebody get him out! It's spreading, it's spreading! The waxworks will go next! Look out! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Are you all right? Are you all right? Yes. No, no, no. Mr. Todd! No, Alice. Alice, there's nothing you can do. Save the waxworks! Save the waxworks! Get some water there, fast! Water, quickly!
