MRS. ALICE SEROR, 30 RUE DU BAC Chapter One. In Tunis, they had explained to her, "You're going to Paris, to live with a lady who pays well." Zohra had never been afraid of anything. She said, "Okay." Mrs. Alice, as she called her, had made rue du Bac her home. Here, her printing house neighbored the publishing houses she worked with and the literary bars she visited every evening. The young Tunisian discovered a type of woman she never could have imagined, one she would have liked to resemble. At the time, I didn't visit rue du Bac, because Alice didn't like me socialising with her son. And yet, by chance, I was there the day Zohra arrived. She says she doesn't know how she'd have turned out without reading. What do you mean? She says she would have gone astray. That's why she's a great editor. Do you know what she called her publishing house? -Marie Aubriac? -No. The Solitary Lady. Mom ruined my shot. I couldn't bring myself to edit it out. Did she teach you to sail? I didn't dare say no. I get so seasick. We write to each other now, like in the 17th century. MARIE AUBRIAC, 28 RUE DE GRENELLE, PARIS 7TH I can open one, if you want? Randomly. Any one. You'll see, it's beautiful. "Simon, in the face of all the doubts that assail you and your difficulties, I would like to give you the same answer that Rilke gave Kappus." "People have oriented their solutions towardthe easy, conventional and toward the easiest side of the easy, but it is clear that we must hold on to what is difficult." "It is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult." "It is also good to love, because love is difficult." Clearly, it isn't what your girlfriends send you, "I'm getting a tan, the clubs are nice." Are you okay? I've not come to since the accident. What? -It's true, you've gained weight. -Yes and no. That's great. Since the printing house had flourished I had the role of the poor relative, and Simon that of the rich cousin. Keen to keep our roles in balance he would share his wonderful life with me. Everything his mom gave him, was for me. If she gave him a car, he would want me to drive it. On the day of the accident, Simon was wearing his seatbelt. He knew how to protect himself. You'll be very happy in 20 years. Documentation of a young man strolling around Paris. I'm making you an underground movie here. In the accident, I lost the use of one ear. As a strange form of compensation I liked girls more than ever. In hospital, I wanted to seduce all the nurses. They did a good job. It was huge, I swear. They are mom's friends, I told them to deal with you. Your son was very brave. He's just a relative. I say, this afternoon… Octave. In Smyrna, when I was young, students would scar themselves to prove their romantic conquests. You've already got your scar. Dad would like me to work for him, at Alice's. When he talks about my future, it's as if he's given me a corpse to hold. There she is. Do you like her? She's a bit old for me. -Nice to meet you! -Good morning! My great uncle, Olga Praquin, a mimic of her condition. Among other things. Here, I stole this for you. TINTIN AND THE BROKEN EAR Maurice, bring the vodka to start. Miss. Are you plotting something with the maitre d'? I've known him for 30 years. I've never eaten at home. Back in the day, I lived in this hotel. I was very happy, between the "L" and the "U". These are the roses I wanted to give you. Only yellow ones, or else Octave isn't happy. For Zohra, the world was getting bigger. After working in the posh neighborhood she would work at Octave's, at my parents. She would say, "Zohra is here for everyone." THE PASSAGE OF DESIRE Is that okay? No money from you. Let Zohra do her thing, cousin Alice is paying for it. You are nice. You are like a daughter. So Raphael is my brother? Goodness! Raphael is my brother. As usual, Alice didn't explain anything to my dad. She just ordered, "Janos, take me to Octave's!" Look, we are beautiful when we are dead. All the wrinkles disappear. Do you like the suit I chose? After a while, it's better to leave. He did it well. Dad. Had he written all this? Yes, all his life. It contains so many stories, it's a real treasure. If only he would have worked on it… They all visited him in Smyrna. Cocteau, Éluard… Here, look. He had two address books. In this one, there are only the names of women. Silvana Manzoni, Barbara Nassau. I say, they are all here. Brigitte Soubiran, what a show-off! She must have annoyed him. Paulette Rey, Paloma, Olga Praquin, that doesn't ring a bell. -Rosette Dubost. -Wait. The vodka, the yellow roses frozen in ice and Olga had fallen for him. Right until the end, Octave had seduced women. He'd created a masterpiece of his life, it was up to him to end it when he wanted. Where could he be? It's okay, he called, he's well. He doesn't like funerals. Does that excuse sit well with you? Do you think it's normal? Madam, my friends, we're congregated here to commit Octave's body to the ground. Friendship does not allow me to keep his spirit to myself… Simon, where are you going? My cousin vanished three days ago, he adored Octave. He's under the control of a crazy girl. They might have left for India or elsewhere. They are reckless! -Your mother needs you right now. -It's her fault. She doesn't want us to see each other. I can't stand it. I'm scared when he's not with me! Marie, do you believe that some people have divine grace and others don't? My cousin is like you. I feel like I'm always beside him without being able to reach him. Let's go. Where? To find your cousin. You're so pleased to imagine yourself on the same side as outcasts. Come on. Where does your cousin hang out? I wanted to meet all the women in Octave's address book. Some had died, others were absent and others pretended not to know him. How did this idea come to you, kid? I'm going to write about his life and I wanted to know you all. A book on Octave? Why do you reply to my letters? Out of pity, out of charity, because my mother entrusted me to you? I like reading your letters, Simon. I like your questions. I must bore you. I'm always sad. Happy people build stations and stores whereas sad people build cathedrals. Raphael! Obviously, I should have thought of that. What are you doing in my bed? I don't want that bastard Polak to touch me anymore. You deprive me of a lot, Judith. Those things make me feel down. Judith, go to bed. Come on Judith, come to bed. I'd get marriage proposals every day. Considering the life he's given me, that Polak would be better off going back to his country. The secretarial office of Marie Aubriac's, publishing house, The Solitary Lady. We thank you for submitting the poem collection. We regret to inform you that poetry is not a genre we publish. Simon was there each time I lost my foothold. He said to me, "Come live with me, write your book on Octave, I'll help you." We need to include… What? …his way of talking about money. -Oh yes. -When you mom showed him around here, so proud of the millions she had blown on decorating he said to her… Can I read it? -Leave that, it's not relevant. -Wait. Created, "k" "r"? Alcohol… But… What? I sent them to The Solitary Lady. No, it doesn't matter. You didn't say it was from me, did you? Are there mistakes? There are mistakes! What does it matter if there are mistakes? That's not how they make their decision! Created with a "k"? You need to maintain your credibility. You need to show it to me! Anyway, what did Octave say when she showed him the decorations? "In the face of all the doubts that assail you and your difficulties, as you say, I want to tell you the same thing Rilke told the young Franz Kappus." "People have oriented all their solutions toward that which is easy, conventional and toward the easiest side of the easy." "Yet it is clear that we must trust in what is difficult." "It is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult." "It is also good to love, because love is difficult." "Marie." You are here all day, aren't you, Zohra? That's why you need to tell me the truth. What are they doing? Does Simon talk? I can't get a word out of him. Mrs. Alice, the truth is that you work too much. You need a man to protect you, that way you can stay at home and look after your son. Mrs. Alice you are beautiful. You can find a man who is rich, classy and chic like you. I don't like the men who are here with you. They are too young for you. It's not good. I don't like the men of my age. Yuck! Those are Octave's words. He talks this way from the first sentence. I don't see it. For a long time, I would go to bed early. I once had a lesson for four hours on those opening words of In Search of Lost Time. Marie sends back manuscripts based on the first sentence alone. We'll see about that. But, there's a hole in the plot in the middle section. Trust me, we can get rid of that. There. But that's about the trafficking of artwork and being sent to jail. We're not taking that out, surely? -That's a sensitive area for mom. -Are you crazy? Octave is the friend of poets and thieves. We can't revisit that. If he comes across as a mere ladies' man, my novel will fail! Your novel… Yes, it's my novel. It's my idea. Without me, no one would have done anything with this. Telephone! -But we're working, Zohra! -I'm coming. Since we were kids, I was the student and Simon the professor. Kiss me. May I never die. -My name is Raphael. -I really don't agree. Eventually, I couldn't imagine existing without his gaze. He has to pay the price, otherwise his freedom is notable. Pay! Worth! Who is coming up there with me? Me! Me! That's enough of nonsense! Don't let yourself get sucked in by a hippy who is ten years behind. Don't worry, Simon, I'll be the last one. I'll invite to the second floor restaurant. Up there, we won't see things in the same way. Come on, Simon. Don't be scared, trust me, I'm here with you. You know very well I never managed to climb a rope. It's like a ladder, it's easy. Come on! The closer you get to her, the further you'll be from Marie Aubriac. Carry on, Simon. You're doing well. You are so intelligent. -Maybe you don't care? -Correct. And my letters? I am a thief, Simon. Be wary. Come back, Raphael! Otherwise you'll do your book alone! Come back, Raphael! It is clear that we must hold on to what is difficult. It is good to be solitary, because solitude is difficult. It is also good to love, because love is difficult. I love you, Raphael. What did you say? What do you want from life? To have fun all day long? And what would I have put on my son's tombstone, Raphael? He died for his cousin? Go Alice. You need to talk to Simon. I'll see you this afternoon for the stock take. I've been waiting for a week. Your work at the printing house is the same as your son's education. Approximative. POLICE EMERGENCY SERVICES -Where are we going? -To Sciences Po, by force if I must! -You won't ruin your life. -We're both pinned, mom. We can't rise up! One day, you'll understand that Raphael is nothing. Boys like him are charming at 20. Once they reach 30, they are idlers avoided by all. Raphael is the son of Judith. In her youth, all the boys loved her. Dad adored her. "Your beautiful cousin". They could only talk of her. Have you seen the outcome? Do you want to end up like her or me? Like neither of you. I want to end up like Octave! All his life he incited passion, even when he was 80 years old. That's nothing. I've got men in my life, that's easy. But Octave wasn't the one paying. I'll stay here until you go in. Oh that's not right, Mrs. Alice. Raphael and Simon won't be pleased. No one touches Raphael's book, not even me, I swear. Why do you think you are? You know me, I'm the maid here, nothing more. Yes, you are the maid, not the daughter of the house. Get out. Stop reading Raphael's book. -Stop reading Raphael's book. -It's not Raphael's book. It's Octave's handwriting. All this is by him. He told me lies, I'd better take this to my lawyer. This is Simon's handwriting. He's been spending his days here then. So you lied. Are you not ashamed? I trusted you. You even swore on your father's head. Admit that Simon has been working for that good-for-nothing! You are mad at Raphael. I watch him. He works all day. He's very tired in the evenings. Primate! Liar! Get out of here! I don't want to see you anymore! -You are fired! -I'll leave, no problem. But you need to give me my paid vacation and pay for all my work at Judith's and at Octave's. Paid vacation? Who taught you those words? You can go back to your country where they pay you in potatoes! You've not got baskets here, woman! I'll leave, Mrs. Alice, I'm not scared but you can get the hell out of here. Now you're giving him your room, and then what next? Come on, let's give him the apartment. Mom, don't create a scene. I thought your cousin deserved everything, him being such a handsome artist, writer. Do you no longer love him? We won't disturb you, we're off. Please, stop mom. -What's the problem, Alice? -None, Raphael. You took his room, I don't want him getting in your way. It's awkward to have someone sleeping in the lounge with visitors. I don't want your friend to feel awkward. I don't like tampons and hair in my brush, but I'm old-fashioned. Your mom is right, Simon. Why are you sleeping in the lounge? Join us. It's not a problem for you Olga, is it? Do you want to join us, Alice? Do you want me to carry you too? They are right, all of them, I've got a crazy son. CAPRI IS OVER! FRANCE IS TOO SMALL. ADIEU, OLGA. Simon. Simon. Simon. Simon. Come on Simon, be brave! Stick your fingers in, don't be scared. There, well done. I get it. If Alice was my mom, I'd have been buried a long time ago. Don't worry, Doctor, I'm used to it. He vomited a lot. Let the doctor do his job, Judith. He knows more than you do. Oh, you! Even in the face of death, I recognize your energy. Don't worry. He took your sedatives. I swallow ten a day and it never killed anyone. For the first time, Alice and Simon talked for a long time that day. She negotiated our separation, as if doing a business deal. They came to an agreement. Simon would go to Berkeley, in the USA, to finish his studies, on the condition that Alice would not prevent the book's publication. Goodbye Juliette. -Too late, you need honour it. -Oh dear, mom! You're getting on my nerves. -You should have left her out of this. -You don't get it. Marie wouldn't have seen you just on a phone call. Believe me, I neutralized her. -Now she's just waiting for me to leave. -Anyway, once the book is out, you can jack in your studies in Berkeley… You're coming with me. It's normal, your Octave's grandson. It's your book, it's your idea. I only corrected the syntax errors. I will explain the process, how you helped me, that I would never have done this book without you. I will tell her. Go on. Marie? Mr. Sobjinsky. You can go in. I always knew I'd get a manuscript from Simon one day and here's his cousin bringing me one. Well, actually, without his help… Well… Try calling him at his home, Anna, please. What were you saying? I can't remember. Apparently… 90% of manuscripts get sent back for the first and final sentences. So, you took particularly good care of them. Here it doesn't work like that. Plus, you've had strings pulled for you. Yes. I would've preferred to do without them. You've got passionate ties within this family. I hope they are included in here. I'll take it with me. Come with me, I'll give you some books. All this has been printed at Alice's. What have you read of these? Nothing. According to Alice, I'm at comic book strip stage. Don't make excuses. It's good to write, but you need to read too. Alice helped me a lot at the start, you know. You'll like this. It's a novel built around a romantic date that was missed by fifteen minutes. Would you like to meet the author? He must be at the Trianon. -Do you know the Trianon? -No. It's my favorite bar. I'll have read it by tomorrow. Marie! Thank you! TWO ENGLISH LADIES HE DID NOT COURT ME WITH FLOWERS, BUT ALWAYS WITH COFFEE TABLE BOOKS. A CERTAIN CHARM I was lucky enough to share the secrets of his life. That is to say, how to live in a hotel without paying, how to get women to pay for you when you are 80 years old. -I know that… -My brother. It's hard to believe… All the media outlets that weren't interested in the book need to realize that he's a not-to-be-missed author. If he wins the prize, and meets the public he could have a lot of success, Martial. You're on the front line, dear Marie. I strained it at tennis. Read it, you'll see for yourself. If there's anyone that deserves the First Novel Prize, -it really is him. -That's right. In this show, there's always a winner. In this case, it's definitely you. -Raphael, did you sleep with Marie? -No. I swear I didn't. I say, mom says that Berkeley is not an opportunity to be missed. She doesn't always just say stupid things. Anyway, if you don't like it, you can always come back sooner. -Shall we go? -Martial, do you know Raphael Sobjinsky? Pleased to meet you. -We've got a long journey ahead. -Two days of signings outside of Paris. You're lucky, she's giving it her all for you. It happens to her occasionally, we don't know what comes over her. It's good. Marie is a Pasionaria. Here is Alice's son. Are you proud of your relative? Did you read his book? Simon is only interested in his studies. Take good care of him. Thanks to him, we'll get to enter the Élysée one day. Anyhow, he doesn't see you anymore. He doesn't call you. -Yes, he calls me. -Oh, please. After everything you did for him. Go on, carry straight on. There we go. -Do you not like it? -Thank you. You do things well. Good night, Marie. Good night, Raphael. Would you rather have this room? Very well, I'll take the other. Yellow flowers, grand hotels, two bedrooms… I'm already familiar with this, you know. I've read the book. The conquest of Paris, the conquest of women… You need to come back down to earth. You must have an odd impression of me. It's okay. The first time I saw you, I understood. You had a flock of women around you and it didn't seem to make you feel overly uncomfortable. I am sorry, but you won't start your life as a Don Juan writer with the editor. You can't say that. I don't care about being a writer. In fact, I'm not one. I only did this novel because of you. For your sake, I really hope that that's not true. Don't make fun of me. I've known you longer than you realize. I feel in love with your book, Raphael, not with you. I'm passionate about my authors, but I don't necessiraly have adventures with them. I could sleep with you, that's not the issue. What would it lead to? We can not sleep together, as long as we're not splitting up. Can I come to have breakfast with you tomorrow morning? Yes, Raphael. Raphael Sobjinsky signs his book, A certain drama. A Certain Charm. Sorry, A Certain Charm. 102 and 103, please, ma'am. Here you go, sir. -Thank you. -You are welcome! A regional Venus. Good night, Raphael. Simon, here. Raphael, shall we order breakfast? Raphael! -Good evening. -Good evening, Alice. Mrs. Aubriac, Mr. Sobjinsky. Your prize should… -How do you know? -Rumors. -Messages for you Mrs. Seror. -Thanks. She says she's fallen in love with the book. That's good for the kid, she'll pay a lot of attention to the next one. She'll have to wait a long time. Sobjinsky didn't write anything and poor Simon was used like a nigger. It's pathetic power. It needs to be known. You can trust me to take care of it. Alice, think of your father. He knew what a novel is. He had read Balzac. He had left his notes in a box. That Marie Aubriac is a skivvy, -for having fallen in the trap. -You know that women are crazy. I don't need to read those little impostors, to know that it's fake. One only need look at his face to see it. -There, thanks. -Thank you, Mr. Thanks a lot. Hello? Martial Rey. For me? Thanks. Therefore, I would like to thank… I would like to thank my cousin, Alice, who always helped me so much. I'm taking it back home. Everyone knows. Marie, this is serious for you, you wipe the slate clean, you do not thrash about… A CERTAIN CHARM We didn't get it. And the rumors? You never know with prizes. They came across another book at the last minute and they all loved it. All the more reason to party. What have you organized now, Raphael? They are usually closed today. For one evening, I'm going to free you of all the literary twerps. Thanks. Let's not make them sad, let's eat it. Have some too. Come, drinks for everyone. -Would you like to dance? -What sort of dance? I don't know, we can shuffle about to the beat on the spot. Dancing. See? I'm respecting the contract. I'm keeping my distance. Write, Raphael. It's the only proof of love that I expect from you. Listen carefully, Raphael. I don't want to see you anymore, I don't want to hear you anymore, as long as I haven't read a page written by you. Your check is ready. Thanks. What is it? It's the balance minus the advance. Do you know if there are… any signings scheduled? It's not selling much downstairs and my cleaner said it's hard to find in bookstores now. Do you want to see Marie? Is she here? I don't know… Yes, go and see her. Ask her if she wouldn't mind seeing me. He had never published anything. "A house of cards." "Raphael Sobjinsky, who was being imposed upon us as a new Radiguet, is more of a Thomas the Impostor." "His editor, Marie Aubriac, who wanted to launch him with a flashy press campaign immediately beat a retreat." People are at saturation point… Raphael Sobjinsky is here, will you see him? -Here, next door? -Yes. -Can I call you back later? -Okay. Sorry. See you shortly. Were you talking nonsense? Where is he? What did you say to him? I don't mind if it's convenient for you to think it was me, darling. Ease your conscience that way. -The truth always comes out. -Dirty tricks also have a price. I'll write to Simon, he'll make all your venom go back in your throat. Do you want his address? Come, I'll give it to you. Do you not want it? Simon left sad. I was the only one at the airport. He witnessed how you abandoned him when you no longer needed him. My son is a very good person, he's very obliging, but he's not a masochist. Write to him, but I'd be surprised if he answered. You're big now, you can manage without him. -Give up, come on. -No, stop! -Come on! -Stop! You are going to die, Alice! You'll die alone, Alice! Like a bitch! Did you hear me? Everyone hates you, Alice, everyone! No one will care if you die! Stop, that's disgusting. Let Zohra do her thing. You are very ill, my brother. I'm staying. Don't be scared, don't move. With time, the young man I had once been seemed dead to me or he belonged to another life. Zohra had found me a good job, as she called it. It was well paid. I renovated the apartments of her bosses, of which she had many. She kept all her money at mine since she didn't have any legal documents. She would tell me to take what I wanted, that I was her brother and that she would give her eyes for me. Come and see this, Zohra. CONTEMPT Read it. Con. Content. -Content. -Contempt. I said it. A… movie… by Jean Louc. "Louc"? Godart. I'll dye my hair. I'll come back blond. -You're crazy. It won't suit you. -I want to do it. I'll become pretty, like the woman in the poster. Why are you laughing? -Raphael, are you going out tonight? -I never said I wasn't. I've bought everything to make a nice dinner for my brother. You're unkind, Raphael! What are you doing? Who are you going out with? I don't report to you. Sorry about dinner, you should have told me in advance. After all I've given you, you can't even dine with your sister. You're not my wife, Zohra. I can be a brother but not your husband. I draw the line there. Yes, I agree completely. Don't get angry. Find yourself a guy, Zohra. -Do your girlfriends not have brothers? -I don't like to sleep. -I don't sleep with anyone, I swear. -You're wrong, Zohra, A handsome guy is good, like your sweetheart Michael Jackson. I wouldn't like to sleep with that guy. -I know your style of guy. -Go wash yourself. I'll iron your suit. You like the classy, chic ones. Of course. Not like you. Go get washed. All my childhood, I'd heard Judith insult my Dad with, "Polak, go back to your country." I never thought that he would actually do it one day. SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY SHOULD NEVER END Janos left without an explanation. Everything was moving around my mom but she had stayed still. When you're 40, all your hair will be white like Octave's. Mrs. Sobjinsky, -Hello. -Can I speak to you for one second? Raphael, do you not remember me? Lucie, the butterfly. Olga's friend. Lucie. -Did you climb the Eiffel Tower? -No. -And you? -Me? I had kids. And have you heard from Olga? -Didn't you hear? -No. She shacked up with a junkie in Sao Paulo, and she immersed herself in that world like a wacko. What happened? They were both HIV-positive but didn't care about it, so that wasn't why they did it. Anyway, they committed suicide, like in Roman times. A real blood bath. Thank you! We'll see each other again. Goodbye. When you see Mrs. Julian, make a fuss. She often speaks to me about you. She saw you on TV. She's got a good memory. Don't belittle yourself. I gave her your book, she loved it. She asked me whether you were married and whether you have kids. I said no. I think that loony wants to get married. She tires me out. She wants me to boost patient moral but I don't want to. It's not my job. It suits you being here. Are you happy? Alice is very nice, you know. She says I can stay as long as I want. I cost her a lot. José, come beside me. I want to thank you for what you are doing for Mom. It's normal Raphael, you are my family. How is Simon? I'm happy. He got his degree. He's teaching at Berkeley now. He met a wonderful student. They are adorable. They asked me whether I wanted them to marry. I said, "Do as you please." You know me, I don't want to be an annoying mom. And you, darling? Are you working? Are you getting by? Not too badly. I'm getting by. I've put this money in a frozen account for you, 20 million old francs, with interest. I hope that in ten years it will still be worth something. I didn't want you to get it when I die, but the day you turn 30, once you've completed all the follies that I believe you to be capable of. For all the annoying paperwork, you can consult Mr. Combot or his successor, if necessary. Octave. Inchallah, you're getting married and you will get the residence permit. Inchallah, girl. My cousin Leïla paid a million for a marriage of convenience. You are rich now. You can invite Zohra to a fancy restaurant. I'll turn up looking beautiful, with my hair done up, and well dressed. I'll pull out the stops for my brother. But you need to turn up well dressed too. Not like now. You're dirty. You mustn't embarrass your sister. Where do you want to go, Zohra? -To Octave's brasserie? -No. No, I want to go to the restaurant you rented for Marie. It's a bar. In that case, we can drink champagne there and then go to a fancy restaurant. Both. Raphael? It's terrible. -Good evening. Zohra, you know Martial. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Hello. -Good evening. -Good evening. Champagne. Is this for me? Yeah. Zohra Jallaoui, Marie Aubriac. I know you. You seem well, Raphael. You too. How's work going? I'm in a rush, we can talk about it another time. Or you can walk me to my car. I'll be right back. Have you got a new car? Do you remember that old heap of metal? The regional signings ended it. Do you still live with your mom? No. She lives in London. She married an Englishman. Love at first sight. You've always been in a rush. Where are you going? Guess. To have dinner with an author, to talk about his work. What else? -Who is that lady who knows me? -My fiancée. I had to replace you with someone, didn't I? I don't believe you. You believed me surrounded by mistresses. It's strange. for someone who reads a lot, you don't have a good sense of character. BREL, DOUBLE ALBUM, 20 TRACKS CHAPTER ONE MARIE AUBRIAC, THE SOLITARY LADY, 8 RUE DAUBER, PARIS I'm sorry. -Buy a house in Tunis with that. -I'm not the maid here. You can't order me to leave with money. You've misunderstood. It's normal that I should reimburse you. Go home. I'd like to sleep. No, I'm not leaving. I'm at home here, I'll leave when I want to. You think you can throw me in the trash! You always use people and then discard them like Olga and Simon. I'm not a dog though! If you see that woman again, I'll have both your head's smashed in! I've got very strong friends. You will never see her again. I'm not having this discussion anymore! You're talking nonsense! Take your things and give me the key. No, I won't give you the key! Stay calm, brother! -I'll leave. -Get up, Zohra. We can't carry on like this, even you. -Take the money and forget me. -Give me the key back! I swear, give me the key! I don't want your money. I don't want your money. I can't take my brother's money! I don't want it! -Stop it, Zohra. -I don't want your money! I don't want it! I'll leave, I swear, but promise me I can visit you. Just once. It's not hard to promise. I'll stop pestering you if you do. Promise. Promise your sister. It's not hard to promise. Promise! No! I didn't report her, the police discovered that she was in France illegally. Much later, I found out she had been deported in a matter of hours. This morning, I remembered a sentence she had told me. "You know, brother, there comes a day, when us foreigners go back home." This is the terrace. I know. Don't tell me. This is where you have breakfast. And there, opposite, there's the tree. You work there. And there, opposite, is the path that leads to the sea. How do you know? I remember Simon's movies. I watched them a lot. It's horrible. Have you started driving again? -I would never have learnt. -Well, yeah. He was always class prefect, unanimously awarded the friendship prize. Did it make you jealous? Not at all, he was second in command. I'd promise champagne for all. Do you still have the same camera? I gave it to Natalie. She's taken over. So, what do you do all day? In the mornings, I write a book. That's good. Does Marie correct the syntax errors? I don't want to show her anything, I just sent her the first page. When you really want to tell a story, you get the hang of syntax, you know. What's it about? About you. Subtitle translation by: Ginger Clark
