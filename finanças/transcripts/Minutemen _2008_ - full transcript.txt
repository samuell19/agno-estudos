HOW'S MY HAIR? GOOD. MINE? SOLID. Both: SCORCH! FIRST DAY OF HIGH SCHOOL, VIRG. WE FINALLY MADE THE BIG TIME. FOOTBALL GAMES, FREE PERIODS... CHICKS. DUDE, YOU GOT A BAT IN THE CAVE. HUH? BOOGIE FEVER. [GIGGLING] AND THAT WAS JUST A TEST. HAD IT BEEN AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY, HOWEVER... OOH. HEY. HEY. OHH. THEIR FIRST HIGH SCHOOL FIGHT. MY BOYS ARE GROWING UP SO FAST. WHERE DOES THE TIME GO? WHO CARES ABOUT OUR PAST, GUYS? ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT IS MY SOCIAL FUTURE. WELL, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO CHANGE. I GOT MY TWO BEST GUYS RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. I'M YOUR FAVORITE, THOUGH, RIGHT? IT'S OK. YOU CAN ADMIT IT. HE'S MAN ENOUGH TO TAKE IT. OH, HO! I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TALKED ME INTO TRYING OUT FOR CHEERLEADING. YOU'LL DO FINE! IT'S HIM I'M WORRIED ABOUT. HE'S ALL IN FULL FREAK MODE ABOUT FOOTBALL TRYOUTS. DON'T WORRY, THOUGH, BRO, I'LL BE THERE FOR MORAL SUPPORT. YOU MEAN TO GOOF AROUND. EXACTLY. VIRGIL, THIS IS SERIOUS. YOU'D BETTER NOT EMBARRASS ME. D-ROCK, I NEVER TRY TO EMBARRASS YOU. IT JUST WORKS OUT THAT WAY. [LAUGHING] Man: LET'S GO! [WHISTLE BLOWS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] FIRST, A LITTLE BOOMBAH. [LAUGHTER] [WHISTLE BLOWS] RELAX, BEAUGARD. BE THE BALL. BE THE BALL. [GIRLS CHANTING CHEERS] [LAUGHTER] Virgil: WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER. [SIGH] OK. THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY. WAIT, COACH. I CAN DO THIS. BRO, WE GOT TO REST YOUR ARM. [WHISTLE BLOWS] [ENGINE BACKFIRING] WHAT IS THAT? Boy: COMING THROUGH! AAH! AAH! COMING THROUGH! I CAN'T CONTROL IT! OH, I'M REALLY SORRY! LOOK OUT! WHOA! [YELLING] LOOK OUT! AAH! AAH! LOOK OUT! AAH! [GIRLS SCREAMING] POM-POMS! LOOK OUT! EXCUSE ME! HE'S CHEWING UP MY FIELD! WHOA! HEY, D-ROCK, ISN'T THAT YOUR NEIGHBOR? YEAH--CHARLIE TUTTLE. YEAH. HE'S THIS KID IN OUR CLASS WHO'S, LIKE, 9 YEARS OLD. THEY SKIPPED HIM A BUNCH OF GRADES BECAUSE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND OF GENIUS. AAH! OH, YEAH, A REAL EINSTEIN. GET OFF OF MY FIELD! RIGHT NOW! STUPID DORK'S GOING DOWN. HEY, DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HE'S GOING AWAY. JUST IGNORE HIM. OH! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW, THAT'S SOME ACCURACY. NICE PLANT! WHOA! [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] Virgil: COME ON! GIVE HIM A BREAK! HEY! HEY! GUYS! HEY! COME ON! WAIT. DEREK! DEREK, YOU WANT TO JUMP IN, THAT'S COOL. DEREK. DEREK! [PLAYERS CHEERING] Charlie: PUT ME DOWN! PUT ME DOWN! GOOD THROW! ALL RIGHT, DEREK. NICE SHOT. THANKS FOR STICKING UP FOR ME. I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT HOW IT TURNED OUT. PLEASE TELL ME I DON'T LOOK AS RIDICULOUS AS YOU DO. NOT THAT BAD, REALLY. THAT'S, UH... THAT'S A NICE RED ON YOU. WELL, I'M CHARLIE TUTTLE. VIRGIL FOX. NICE TO MEET YOU. [SIGH] SO... WHAT'S THE STORY WITH THAT ROCKET CART THING? I ALWAYS GET A HARD TIME ON THE BUS, AND I HYPOTHESIZED THAT A ROCKET-PROPULSION ALL-TERRAIN CAR WOULD HELP ME AVOID EMBARRASSMENT. UH-HUH. YEAH. AND HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU? IT'S WORKING GREAT. MY EMOTION MODULATOR ACTUALLY ALLOWS ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ALBERT FELINESTEIN IS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIS VARIOUS MEOWS. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? Boy: HEY, WHAT'S UP, DEREK? Different boy: HEY, GREAT TO SEE YOU, MAN. VIRGIL? UH, VIRGIL? HEY, EARTH TO VIRGIL. VIRG! DON'T YOU THINK, VIRGIL? VIRGIL, AREN'T YOU EXCITED? YES...CHARLIE, I'M THRILLED THAT YOU TALK TO YOUR CAT. UM...I'M NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN, BUT I BELIEVE YOU MAY BE EMPLOYING SARCASM. CHARLIE, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I MEAN, YOUR INVENTIONS ALWAYS WORK. I CAN ONLY ACT SO SURPRISED EVERY TIME YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO POWER YOUR HOUSE WITH TARTAR SAUCE. [SNORTS] IT'S COCKTAIL SAUCE! YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD REALLY MAKE ME HAPPY? IS IF YOU BUILT SOMETHING USEFUL. BY "USEFUL," I MEAN SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE ME RICH AND POPULAR-- OR BOTH. BOTH. HEY, HEY! YOU CAN'T RIDE THAT THING... HEY, GREAT BIKE. LOTS OF SHINY CROME... GEARY THINGS. [MUFFLED YELLING] [BELL RINGS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Charlie: DID YOU KNOW THAT THE CHEMICAL CONTENT OF PUDDING ACTUALLY MAKES YOU GROW TALLER? Boy: IT DOES. YEAH. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SO TALL. THE ELECTROLYTES AND EVERYTHING. AND NOW... AND GO. AH...YES! I WIN! SENIOR YEAR, AND I'M STILL EATING AT THE DORK TABLE. NO OFFENSE, GUYS. I DO ENJOY THE STIMULATING CONVERSATION. HEY, NONE TAKEN. SERIOUSLY, HOW DID IT COME TO THIS? LET'S SEE. MAYBE YOUR PLIGHT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH BEING STRIPPED, DRESSED IN MINISKIRTS, AND HUNG FROM THE SCHOOL MASCOT? AND HAD A PICTURE OF IT MAKE THE COVER OF THE YEARBOOK, 3 YEARS IN A ROW. AND WAS ON ALL THE LOCAL NEWS STATIONS. AND THE SPANISH CHANNEL. YES, THE INCIDENT I WILL ONE DAY BE EXPLAINING TO A VERY EXPENSIVE THERAPIST. HEY, HUMMINGBIRD. [MUTTERING] THAT'S CHARLIE-SPEAK FOR "HELLO." HI. EXCUSE ME, MISS? UH, WHY DO YOU CALL HIM "HUMMINGBIRD"? OH. I LOVE BIRDS. ALL KINDS OF BIRDS. YOU KNOW, BIG BIRDS, LITTLE BIRDS--OOH! I'M EVEN THE OFFICIAL SECRETARY FOR THE JUNIOR CHAPTER OF THE JUNIOR BIRD BUDDIES OF AMERICA. OOH! SUCH AN HONOR. ANYWAYS, GOT TO RUN. FIX THAT. OH, WELL, THAT EXPLAINS IT. [GRUNTING] JEANETTE HAS BEEN SWEATING YOU FOR TWO YEARS. WHAT IS YOUR DEAL? FORGET IT! I'M MARRIED TO SCIENCE. HEY! CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY. [LAUGHING] THANKS. OW. PARDON ME, GENTS. AH, SODA. I HEAR IF YOU LEAVE A PENNY IN THIS STUFF FOR A WEEK, IT COMES OUT, LIKE, SHINY. I WAS ACTUALLY PLANNING ON DRINKING IT. WELL... NEVER MIND, THEN. HA HA HA! SO, UM... HOW ARE YOU, VIRG? I MEAN, I DIDN'T REALLY SEE YOU MUCH THIS SUMMER. I WAS DOING, YOU KNOW, LOT OF MOUNTAIN CLIMBING, JET SKIING... VIDEOGAMES? I DIDN'T LEAVE THE COUCH. YOU? OH, THE USUAL-- POOL PARTIES, CHEERLEADING CAMP. BUT, UM...I DID TAKE THIS AWESOME ARCHITECTURE CLASS. OH, THAT'S COOL. I REMEMBER YOU MADE A GINGERBREAD HOUSE, AND IT HAD, LIKE, 10 ROOMS. AND WALK-IN CLOSETS. IT TOOK US 6 MONTHS TO EAT IT. [BELL RINGS] OH. WELL... I HAVE CALCULUS. HATE IT. NEED IT. CAN'T BE AN ARCHITECT WITHOUT IT. AND I GOT PUBLIC SPEAKING. HATE IT. NEED IT. CAN'T BE A GAME SHOW HOST WITHOUT IT. [SIGH] THERE'S A GOOD REASON TESLA'S BIOGRAPHER NAMED HIS BOOK "A MAN OUT OF TIME." TESLA WAS SO FAR ADVANCED OVER HIS CONTEMPORARIES THAT THEY OFTEN DERI-- THAT--HEH. THEY OFTEN DERIDED HIM AS... JOCELYN, WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH TO ASK THAT YOU NOT DO YOUR NAILS WHILE I LECTURE? SORRY. WHEN ARE YOU DONE? [LAUGHTER] EXCUSE ME! AH, MR. TUTTLE. I BELIEVE YOU ARE HERE FOR YOUR BOOSTER CHAIR. I'LL GET IT LATER! IT'S A-- IT'S AN A.V. CLUB EMERGENCY! I NEED VIRGIL FOX RIGHT AWAY. Teacher: VIRGIL FOX? HE'S OUT SICK TODAY. I HEAR HE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT. VERY FUNNY, MR. FOX. YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR HALL PASS ON YOUR WAY OUT. THAT'S IT. I'M MOVING TO PARAGUAY. Virgil: YOU EVER REALLY LOOKED AT OUR SCHOOL MASCOT? Charlie: FORGET THAT STUPID HALL PASS! REMEMBER THAT ROCKET-PROPULSION ALL-TERRAIN CAR THAT I HAD BACK ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT? THANKS FOR MENTIONING THAT AGAIN. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN ALMOST 10 MINUTES SINCE SOMEONE BROUGHT IT UP? LISTEN! IT TIES TOGETHER. THAT INVENTION MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS, BUT ONE ELEMENT OF THE DESIGN WAS PROVEN VIABLE-- THE QUANTUM ACCELERATOR. YOU REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ON THAT PHYSICS- NEW-REALITY- MANY-WORLDS-THEORY KICK? OH, YEAH. THAT WAS FUN. WELL, I STARTED BUILDING MY OWN THEORY BASED ON ALL THAT WORK, INCORPORATING MY PROVEN HYPOTHESIS OF QUANTUM ACCELERATION. THEN I PUT ONE OF THE SCHOOL'S COMPUTERS ON PERMANENT RESERVE. THE DSL's BEEN DOING ALL THE WORK. AND MOMENTS AGO, I UPLOADED THE LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. COMMANDER TUTTLE ON THE BRIDGE. DUDE, NO WAY I'M SALUTING YOU. FINE. AT EASE. [RAPID TYPING] WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU IS VERY, VERY... VERY TOP SECRET. OK. LET'S KEEP THIS JUST BETWEEN US. CHECK IT OUT. [BEEPING] YEAH? [SIGH] WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS A SUCCESSFUL SIMULATION OF PRACTICAL TIME TRAVEL. UH, UM... WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [WHISPERING] I'M TRYING TO STOP ANY MORE OF YOUR BRAIN FROM LEAKING OUT OF YOUR EARS. WHAT? COME ON. YESTERDAY, YOU SAID I SHOULD BUILD SOMETHING USEFUL. WELL, TIME TRAVEL IS USEFUL. CHARLIE, YOU'RE 14 YEARS OLD. YOU'RE TWO YEARS AWAY FROM YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE, YOU STILL CALL YOUR UNDERWEAR "UNDERPANTS," YET I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE YOU CAN BUILD A TIME MACHINE? YES! AND BASED ON MY SPECIFICATIONS, A PERSON CAN TRAVEL UP TO 48 HOURS INTO THE PAST. THAT'S WEAK. PARDON ME! HOW IS YOUR TIME TRAVEL FORMULA COMING ALONG? [SIGH] IT'S ALL ABOUT LIGHT, RIGHT? NOTHING MOVES FASTER. WELL, MY HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTS THAT YOU CAN TIME TRAVEL ON A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM ANY LIGHT SOURCE, EVEN LIGHT FROM A SLIDE PROJECTOR. A SLIDE PROJECTOR? LIKE A REGULAR SLIDE PROJECTOR? DID I SAY REGULAR? NO, I DIDN'T. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A COMPLEX AMALGAMATION OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED INTERNAL COMBUSTION MECHANICS. WHICH YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT, BY THE WAY. WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A HARDWARE GUY. I DON'T SEE THIS AS A PROBLEM. HEY, CHICKADEE, WHAT'S SHAKING? YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE CHARLIE. HE'S NERVOUS AROUND GIRLS. NO, I'M NOT! OH. IT'S COOL. I LIKE SHY BOYS. UH... WHAT'S IN THE BOWL? MERINGUE. THE ASSIGNMENT. HEH HEH! HERE. TAKE MINE. I'LL MAKE A NEW ONE. DID YOU SEE THAT? WHAT? SHE GAVE YOU MERINGUE. THAT'S HUGE. I JUST NEED TO KNOW. ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME WITH THIS OR NOT? ARE YOU GONNA BE PART OF SOMETHING, MAKE HISTORY? OR ARE YOU GONNA SIT ON THE SIDELINES AND BE A PASSIVE OBSERVER? OK, LOOK. I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL. I'LL HELP YOU WITH YOUR TIME MACHINE. I'LL EVEN HELP YOU FIND A HARDWARE GUY. BUT WHEN WE TRY IT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE'RE GONNA USE IT FOR WHATEVER I WANT TO DO. ALL RIGHT. RIGHT. BUT, VIRGIL, THIS HARDWARE PERSON WE NEED-- IT'S TRICKY. WHY? BECAUSE HE NOT ONLY NEEDS TO BE GIFTED MECHANICALLY, BUT ALSO, LET'S SAY, REQUIRE A CERTAIN MORAL FLEXIBILITY-- YOU KNOW, LIVES ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY. WELL... WHAT ABOUT HIM? ZEKE? ARE YOU SERIOUS? LOOK AT HIM! HE'S--HE'S... PERFECT. YOU KNOW THOSE MONSTER TRUCK SHOWS WHERE THEY HAVE THE BIG METAL DINOSAURS THAT BREATHE FIRE AND DESTROY CARS. I'VE SEEN THE COMMERCIALS. YEAH. HE AND HIS DAD BUILD THOSE. KILLERSAURUS-- 15,000 POUNDS OF JAW-CRUSHING FORCE! I GET IT. LOOK OUT, FOLKS. IT'S CARNIVOROUS! I GET IT! I GET IT. [CAT MEOWING] YOUR CAT IS FREAKING ME OUT. NO, THAT'S NOT MY CAT. IT'S HIS. HIS NAME IS ALBERT FELINESTEIN. THAT'S THE DUMBEST NAME FOR A CAT I'VE EVER HEARD. COULDN'T--COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE, ZEKE. ZEKESTER! SSS... YEAH, NO. I HATE-- I HATE WHEN PEOPLE BEND NAMES, TOO, LIKE VIRGILOCITY. I'M, LIKE, COME ON, PEOPLE, IT'S VIRGIL. I'M GONNA STOP TALKING NOW. AMY, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS IS A PRIVATE MEETING. OH, I'M SORRY. I JUST CAME DOWN TO WATCH TV, BUT MOM DID MENTION YOU HAD A NEW FRIEND OVER, A BOY. EW! HE'S GROSS! JEEZ, VIRGIL, WHY CAN'T YOU BRING HOME CUTE BOYS? AMY...LEAVE NOW, OR I'M TELLING MOM YOU'RE DOING MAKEOVERS ON THE HAMSTERS AGAIN. CHILL. I'M OUT OF HERE. IT'S LIKE I WALKED INTO AN UGLY CONTEST. SHE'S A CHARMER. YEAH. OK. THIS THING? RIGHT, THIS QUANTUM INTEGRATION INTO THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF LIGHT PROJECTION? LOOKS LIKE IT COULD WORK. YEAH. MONGO READ. OK. SO YOU'LL HELP US CONSTRUCT IT? WHY NOT? I'M ALWAYS UP FOR A CHALLENGE... AND FREE BEAN DIP. UM... YOU HAVE A LITTLE... NO. JUST... SOME BEAN. DO THAT AGAIN, AND I WELD YOU TO THE CROSS-TOWN BUS. SO HAVE YOU GUYS THOUGHT HOW WE'RE GONNA USE THIS THING? THE FIRST JOURNEY BACK THROUGH TIME WILL OBVIOUSLY BE A MONUMENTAL EVENT. OUR SPECIFIC GOAL ON THAT JOURNEY SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY GRANDIOSE. I'VE GOT IT! TWO WORDS, GENTLEMEN: THE LOTTERY. NICE. ABSOLUTELY NOT, VIRGIL. I REFUSE TO AGREE TO THAT. OH, BUT YOU ALREADY DID. YOU SAID THAT IF I HELPED YOU BUILD THE TIME MACHINE, WE'D USE IT FOR WHATEVER I WANT TO DO. NO DO-OVERS! HEH HEH! DO YOU WANT TO TIME TRAVEL OR DON'T YOU? FINE. YES! HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO JUST PLUG THIS THING INTO A WALL OUTLET. THIS IS GONNA TAKE SOME MAJOR AMPERAGE. NOT TO MENTION PRIVACY AND A LOT OF SPACE. I KNOW THE PLACE! IT'S PERFECT! IT'S COMPLETELY PERFECT! COME ON. COME ON! VICE PRINCIPAL TOLKAN, UH, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT STARTING A NEW CLUB. NO CAN DO. WE ARE COMPLETELY MAXED OUT ON CLASSROOM SPACE. YEAH. FUTURE FONDUERS OF AMERICA WERE THE LAST ONES IN. IS THAT CHESTER IN THE VENDING MACHINE? HEY, FELLAS. DO ANY OF YOU HAVE 4 QUARTERS? THIS THING'S NOT TAKING MY DOLLAR. AREN'T YOU GONNA DO SOMETHING? LIKE WHAT? CHANGE THE WAY HIGH SCHOOL WORKS? [CHUCKLE] NO, GENTLEMEN. EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD HAS AN ORDER. THERE ARE THOSE WHO STUFF OTHERS INTO VENDING MACHINES AND, UM, THOSE WHO GET STUFFED INTO VENDING MACHINES. IT'S JUST THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS. IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE VICE PRINCIPAL'S HANDBOOK. UH, ANYWAY... ABOUT OUR CLUB. UH, WE WERE-- ROOM 77! WE WANT ROOM 77. IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN. [MACHINE WHIRRING] OH! LIKE THIS. [GRUNTING] [SIGH] PERHAPS WE CAN CONVINCE YOU TO RECONSIDER. HUH. EH... HMM. DONE. HEH! ALL RIGHT, SCOOCH OVER TO YOUR LEFT. I'M GOING AFTER THE PRETZEL NUBS. Charlie: THE NORTH WING OF THE OLD BUILDING WAS KNOCKED DOWN TO MAKE SPACE FOR THE FOOTBALL FIELD, WHICH WE'RE UNDERNEATH NOW. ROOM 77 WAS ACTUALLY BUILT TO BE THE SCHOOL'S FALLOUT SHELTER BACK IN THE 1950s. I THINK IT'S RIGHT THROUGH HERE. SOMEONE CALL "EXTREME CLASSROOM MAKEOVER." THIS--THIS IS A DISASTER!

[SPEAKING FRENCH] SEE? THAT'S WHY I NEED HER HELP. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID. I SAID, "MY BOYFRIEND IS A LYING CHEESEBRAIN." COME ON, STEPH.

YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME I ALMOST DROWNED? BECAUSE DEREK SHOVED THE NOZZLE UP YOUR NOSE? YEAH! THEN HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY, AND HE CRACKED HIS HEAD ON THE TELEPHONE POLE. SHH! SHH! SHH! I MISS US. TRES AMIGOS. YEAH. YOU KNOW, DEREK REALLY DID TRY TO STOP THOSE FOOTBALL PLAYERS, BUT YOU KNOW HOW SENIORS ARE. ANYWAY, I KNOW HE FEELS REALLY BAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T LET GO OF THE PAST DIE FASTER... AND GET MORE ACNE. SWEATING LIKE 5 HOGS. DUE TO THE VARYING IRREGULARITIES IN TEMPERATURE, I THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE PREPARED! OK. GOT THE WINNING LOTTERY NUMBERS RIGHT HERE. OK. IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT THE VORTEX MAINTAINS STABILITY LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO RETURN SAFELY, WE'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE 10 MINUTES ON THE OTHER SIDE. OTHERWISE, WE RUN THE RISK OF EXPLODING. UH... THAT'S FUNNY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID "EXPLODING." I DID. ACTIVATING GRID. UM...WHAT'S WITH THE GRAPPLING HOOK? YOU MAKING FUN OF THE HOOK? WHAT? NO. NO, NO, NO. I LOVE--LOVE THE HOOK. OK. NEXT STOP, FUNKYTOWN. [YELLING] I JUST REMEMBERED, I FORGOT TO TRIPLE-CHECK THE--THE... YAH! OW! OH. OH. [YELLING] [YELLING] WE GOT TO WORK ON OUR LANDINGS.

NEW PLAN: WE'LL MEET YOU HERE TOMORROW AT 12:00. HANG ON TO THE TICKET TILL THEN. OK? OK! OK. THAT'S THE SECOND FLUCTUATION OF THE EXACT SAME MAGNITUDE IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATION. I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S A TECHNICAL GLITCH. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE? YOU THINK THEY ALL OF A SUDDEN STARTED DRILLING FOR OIL IN SUMMERTON? NOW, LET'S JUST GET BACK TO WORK, ALL RIGHT? CAN YOU HELP ME UNKNOT THIS? [CROWD CHATTERING] Woman: AN INCREDIBLE STORY FROM SUMMERTON THIS AFTERNOON. THE WINNER OF THE STATE LOTTERY ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE NONE OTHER THAN ROBOT MAN! TOLD YOU. OK. SO TOMORROW, WE GO BACK IN TIME AND GET A NEW LOTTERY TICKET, BUT THIS TIME, WE BE SURE-- NO, VIRGIL! IT'S WRONG. IT'S CHEATING. RIGHT. IT IS CHEATING. OK, NEW PLAN: WE GO ON TV WITH THE MACHINE, DO AN INFOMERCIAL, SELL, LIKE, 8,000 OF THEM, AND INSTANTLY BECOME RICH AND HUMONGOUSLY POPULAR! AND THEY SAY YOU CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS. LISTEN TO ME! IF ANYONE FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS TIME MACHINE, IT'LL BE THE END OF ME, YOU, AND ZEKE-- THE END! CAN YOU BACK UP? I HAVE PERSONAL SPACE ISSUES. OHH, NO. [BELL RINGS] WE JUST GOT TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. I KNOW THERE'S AN IMPORTANT USE FOR THE MACHINE. WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING RICH AND POPULAR? I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING! MOSTLY. HEY, CHESTER, LOOKING FOR THESE? HEY! GIVE ME THOSE! [STUDENTS GASPING] [LAUGHTER] IF YOU'RE TRYING OUT A NEW LOOK, CHESTER, LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY IT'S NOT WORKING. THOSE KIDS STOLE MY CLOTHES. CAN YOU HELP ME GET THEM BACK? [SIGH] I'D LIKE TO-- REALLY, I WOULD-- BUT THAT WOULD BE ALTERING THE DELICATE SOCIAL SYSTEM HERE AT THE SCHOOL. SO...GOOD LUCK. [LAUGHTER] VIRGIL, I JUST HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA. YOU MEAN, TO USE THE TIME MACHINE... EXACTLY! HA! HA! STARCH! AGAIN, SCORCH. DID YOU EVEN READ THE INSTRUCTIONS I E-MAILED YOU? I'M SORRY. OK. SO--SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU'RE SAYING WE BECOME, LIKE, SILENT HEROES TO THE UNCOOL? LOOK AROUND. WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE MERE MINUTES CAN MAKE OR BREAK A PERSON'S ENTIRE FUTURE. TAKE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME FRESHMAN YEAR. HAD I KNOWN THAT STICKING UP FOR CHARLIE WOULD HAVE RUINED MY LIFE, I NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE IT. WHY DON'T YOU TELL US HOW YOU REALLY FEEL? THINK ABOUT ALL THE KIDS AT THIS SCHOOL... LIKE CHESTER, LIKE US. WE ALL LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR OF HUMILIATION BECAUSE WE HAPPEN TO BE SMALLER, LESS COORDINATED, WHATEVER. WE CAN CHANGE THAT. THE MINUTEMEN MUST USE THEIR POWERS FOR TRUTH, JUSTICE... AND THEN WE FOCUS ON GETTING RICH. AGAIN, I'M--I'M KIDDING. WHO ARE THE MINUTEMEN? WE. US. THE ALL-IMPORTANT MINUTES IN TIME. CLEVER, RIGHT? SORT OF. NOT REALLY. FORGET IT! NONE OF THESE REMOTE-CONTROL HOOKUPS ARE GONNA WORK. THIS IS NO GOOD! WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS WHILE WE'RE BACK IN TIME. WELL, I GUESS ONE OF US IS JUST GONNA HAVE TO HANG BACK. NOT IT! NOT IT! NOT IT! OHH! DANG IT! THIS IS UNFAIR! I INVENTED THE MACHINE. OK. RE-DO. NOT IT! NOT IT! NOT IT! DAAA! DOUBLE DANG IT! Jeanette: NOT IT! THAT WAS FUN. NOT IT! UH...JEANETTE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR A CLUB TO JOIN, AND I SAW YOURS ON THE VICE PRINCIPAL'S LIST. THE "BACK TO THE FUTURE" FAN CLUB? OH. RIGHT. I LOVE THAT MOVIE. HEH! EVEN THOUGH I NEVER REALLY SAW IT. BUT I TOTALLY LOVE THE WHOLE IDEA OF TIME TRAVEL. I MEAN, IT'S JUST SO... SCIENCE-FICTIONY? ACTUALLY, JEANETTE, YOUR TIMING IS INTERESTING. NO, IT ISN'T, VIRGIL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? UH...AHEM. EXCUSE US. THINK ABOUT IT. [ALL WHISPERING] SHH! SHH! NO! NO! NO... LISTEN TO ME. NO! NO! NO...

I MEAN, HAD HE STILL OWNED THE SHRIMP AND WAFFLE HUT, THAT WOULD BE, LIKE, NO HELP AT ALL. HEH! YEAH. Virgil: I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FORM-FITTING THAT WOULD HIGHLIGHT THESE MASSIVE GUNS. BRO, YOU'RE BUILT LIKE A CHIHUAHUA. YEAH, WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE A YETI IN THAT THING. YOU PROBABLY THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT A YETI IS. DO YOU? VIRGIL, GROW UP! ME GROW UP? HOW ABOUT YOU GROW UP? HEY, DON'T YELL AT CHARLIE. I'M NOT YELLING... [YELLING] Charlie: I NEVER YELL AT PEOPLE--WHOA! Zeke: NO YELLINGGGGGG! I NEVER THOUGHT TIME TRAVEL WOULD INVOLVE SO MUCH BICKERING. OH, MAN! OHH... Virgil: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, FRIEND. UH, IF YOU GUYS ARE GONNA PICK ON ME, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A NUMBER. DON'T BE AFRAID. WE'RE HERE TO HELP. OH, WHAT'S GOING ON, FELLAS? OH.

Tolkan on P.A.: NURSE RATCHED AND COACH BOB HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE, AND THEY ASSURE ME THAT IT IS NOT CONTAGIOUS. ONE MORE THING BEFORE WE WRAP UP THIS MORNING'S ANNOUNCEMENTS: RECENTLY, A GROUP OF STUDENTS DRESSED IN SNOWSUITS DISRUPTED A GYM CLASS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY DESTROYED MY PRECIOUS DIORAMA. WHOEVER YOU STUDENTS ARE, LET ME MAKE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT ONCE YOU ARE IDENTIFIED, YOU WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED. THAT IS ALL. COOL! WE'RE OUTLAWS. ON THE RUN FROM JOHNNY LAW. NAUGHTINESS!

I APPLIED FOR A CHEERLEADING SCHOLARSHIP, AND THEY'RE SENDING A SCOUT OVER THIS WEEK, WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO WORK EXTRA HARD ON MY PYRAMID DISMOUNT. THAT'S SO COOL. I'M SO PSYCHED FOR YOU! YOU LOVE THAT SCHOOL! I KNOW. Derek: STEPH! OH. DEREK. AH. I GOT TO GO TELL HIM ABOUT THE SCHOLARSHIP. SO...I'LL SEE YOU LATER, VIRG. BYE. CHARLIE, WHAT'S WRONG? OK. WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU ABOUT THE TIME TRAVEL FORMULA. AS YOU REMEMBER, THERE WAS ONE LAST PIECE OF THE EQUATION THAT EVADED MY MIND FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL I FINALLY FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR DOING AN EXTENSIVE AROUND-THE-CLOCK INTERNET DOWNLOADING PROCEDURE. HE WAS HACKING. IT GETS WORSE. I STOLE IT FROM NASA. YOU ROBBED NASA? UNH! [WHISPERING] ALL RIGHT. IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS. YES, IT IS. IT'S WORSE THAN IT SOUNDS. THE FILES WERE FROM THE 1960s. THEY WERE DEFUNCT. NO ONE HAS TOUCHED THEM FOR DECADES. THIS IS BAD, REAL BAD. WE COULD GO TO PRISON! OH, JUST SO YOU GUYS KNOW, IF WE DO GO TO PRISON AND WE SHARE THE SAME CELL, I SNORE LIKE A CHAINSAW. THAT'S GREAT! THIS WON'T BE A PROBLEM, OK? AS LONG AS WE JUST DON'T USE THE MACHINE FOR A WHILE AND LAY LOW. MMM. DROPPED A GRAPE. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] FORGET IT, VIRGIL. IT'S TERRIBLE THAT STEPHANIE FELL OFF THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID, BUT FORGET IT! I MEAN, WE ALL SAID THAT WE WERE BEING WATCHED, RIGHT? THE HEAT IS ON! LOOK, CHARLIE, IF WE DON'T HELP STEPHANIE, SHE COULD LOSE OUT ON HER SCHOLARSHIP. WE HAVE TO GO BACK. YOU JUST WANT TO BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BIG, CREEPY CRUSH ON HER. OH! CREEPY CRUSH? I VOTE YES. CHARLIE, YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. THE FILES YOU HACKED INTO WERE DEFUNCT. I BET NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THEY'RE MISSING. NEED I REMIND YOU, WE ARE THE MINUTEMEN... NOT THE WEENIEMEN. DON'T BE LATE FOR DINNER. [YELLING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] OK. WE NEED A PLAN OF ACTION. WE NEED TO BE EXTREMELY DISCREET. AT THE SAME TIME, BOLD AND DECISIVE. ZEKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK? HURRY UP. ZEKE? WHERE DID HE GO? WELL, AT LEAST WE GOT THE "BOLD AND DECISIVE" PART. GO! GO! COME BACK HERE! [CRASH] AAH! SNOWSUIT GUYS. Girl: AND UP! WHAT'S UP, GENE? HEY, DUDES, MIND IF I HACK IN? STOP! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! LET'S GO, RAMS! WHOO! OH! OOH! OH...OH...OH... [SCREAMING] Girl: GOOD CATCH, SNOWSUIT GUY! WOW. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT YOU'RE AMAZING. GET OUT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] GET--AAH! UNH! ERR! ALL RIGHT! WAY TO GO, SNOWSUIT GUYS! AND WE'RE CALLED THE MINUTEMEN! YEEHA! HEY. LOOK AT CHESTER. LOOKING GOOD, CHESTER. ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS, YOU GUYS ARE IN MY WAY. LEAVE US ALONE, CHESTER. QUITE FRANKLY, I'M NOT FOND OF YOUR HAT. EXCUSE ME. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? CHESTER AND HIS FRIENDS KEEP HARASSING US. SHUT UP, DIRTBALL! ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY JUST SETTLE DOWN. CHESTER, LAST I REMEMBER, YOU WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD CHAIN, AND I WILL NOT TOLERATE STUDENTS LEAP-FROGGING TO A HIGHER SOCIAL STATUS, SO YOU COME WITH ME. "RAM'S HORN"? THANKS. SURE. "ROBOT MAN SUES OLD LADY"? VIRGIL, THIS IS BAD. WE'RE CHANGING THE OUTCOME OF THINGS WE NEVER PLANNED ON. OUR JUMPS ARE CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION. HOW SO? CHESTER GETTING IN TROUBLE? THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. ROBOT MEN SUING OLD LADIES! DAW! THAT'S A WORLD GONE MAD! MAD, I TELL YOU! GLOBAL WARMING. HE'S REALLY FREAKED OUT. HEY. YOU, UH, NEED A HAND? UH, STEPH? NOT--NOT REALLY. UM, WHAT ARE YOU-- WELL, JUST I FIGURED IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO, YOU KNOW, TO THANK YOU. WELL, FOR WHAT? FOR SAVING ME, SNOWSUIT GUY. WHAT? WHAT? NO. OH, DON'T EVEN TRY IT, VIRG. "GET OUT"? PLEASE. YOU, CHARLIE, AND ZEKE THOMPSON ARE THE SNOWSUIT GUYS. STEPHANIE. OH, I KNEW IT! OH, THAT IS SO COOL! SEE, IF I FIGURED IT OUT BECAUSE I STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT. ALL THOSE KIDS THAT YOU HELPED, IT WAS ALWAYS RIGHT BEFORE SOMETHING BAD WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN JUST LIKE WITH ME! STEPH, THAT IS RIDICULOUS. HOW IN THE WORLD ARE WE GONNA KNOW WHEN SOMETHING BAD IS GONNA HAPPEN? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I ASKED MYSELF, AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I FIGURED IT OUT. NO, YOU DIDN'T. YES, I DID. NO. YOU COULDN'T HAVE. ADMIT IT, VIRGIL. YOU, CHARLIE, AND ZEKE ARE PSYCHIC. ARE TIME TRAVELERS? WHAT? WHO SAID TIME TRAVELERS? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. GET OUT. WE'RE PSYCHIC. WE'RE PSYCHIC. NO. I HEARD YOU-- YOU--YOU'RE RIGHT. UH-UH, VIRGIL. YOU SAID TIME TRAVEL. OH, MY GOSH! THAT IS SO COOL! HOW DO YOU DO IT, HUH, HUH, HUH? [CROWD CHEERING] DOWN! BLUE 13, BLUE 13! HIKE! TIMEOUT, TIMEOUT! Boy: 6 SECONDS LEFT IN THIS MATCH-UP OF CROSSTOWN RIVALS. THE HORNETS CLINGING TO A 4-POINT LEAD AS WE COME UPON FOURTH AND GOAL FOR SUMMERTON. OH, FOOTBALL. REMIND ME WHY WE'RE HERE AGAIN. BECAUSE SOME POOR KID ALWAYS EMBARRASSES HIMSELF AT ONE OF THESE THINGS. JUST KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY VERY BRIGHT, EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE ME AS SPUTTY. SPUTTY? A CROSS BETWEEN SPUNKY AND NUTTY. GREAT. LISTEN, BEAU. IT'S ALL IN YOUR HANDS, BUT NO PRESSURE, ALL RIGHT? FORGET THAT THERE'S 6 SECONDS LEFT ON THE CLOCK, FORGET THAT YOU COULD PUT SUMMERTON HIGH ON THE MAP, FORGET THAT MY LITTLE BOY IS UP THERE IN THAT STANDS, LOOKING DOWN ON HIS FATHER TRYING TO FULFILL A LIFELONG DREAM OF WINNING A STATE CHAMPIONSHIP! FORGET ALL THAT. WHAT I WANT IS YOU TO, UH... BE THE BALL? BE THE BALL. BE THE BALL! GO GET THEM! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DOWN! BLUE 42! BLUE 42! SET, HIKE! WHOO! NOW WE'RE TALKING! NOW WE'RE TALKING! NOW WE'RE TALKING! FOR A GUY WITH NUDITY ISSUES, HE'S REALLY COME FULL CIRCLE. Announcer: DEREK BEAUGARD LOSES THE BALL. THERE'S A FUMBLE ON THE PLAY! HAMILTON'S GOT IT! OHH! THE HORNETS WIN! WHAT A HEARTBREAKER FOR SUMMERTON! Derek: I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE GONNA DO BIG THINGS, VIRG, BUT TIME TRAVEL? THAT'S WHACKED-OUT, MAN. Amy: 1, 2, 3, 4, YOUR TEAM STINKS, YOU'LL NEVER SCORE! AMY. 5, 6, 7, 8, YOU CAN'T TOUCH THIS, I'M TOO GREAT. AMY, THAT'S IT. UPSTAIRS. COME ON. STEPHANIE, I DIDN'T EVEN SEE YOU. IT'S SO WEIRD THAT YOU'RE HERE, AND, OH, MY GOSH, DEREK BEAUGARD? YOU'RE, LIKE, THE BEST FOOTBALL PLAYER EVER EXCEPT FOR THAT BLOWN PLAY YESTERDAY. JUST GO. AMY, GO WATCH CARTOONS. NO. I'M SO, SO SORRY. I'M TRYING TO TALK MY FOLKS INTO CAGING HER WHENEVER THERE'S COMPANY. SHE'S SO CUTE. AHEM. OH, SO, UM, ABOUT THE GAME YESTERDAY, VIRG. THAT WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR DEREK, AND HE KIND OF FEELS LIKE HE LET EVERYBODY IN SCHOOL DOWN. I KNOW I WOULD HAVE WON THAT GAME. BUT THEN CHESTER STREAKED ACROSS THE FIELD AND DISTRACTED HIM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO ALL THE DORKS LATELY. IT'S LIKE THEY JUST DON'T KNOW THEIR PLACE ANYMORE. SO YOU GUYS WANT THE MINUTEMEN TO STOP CHESTER FROM INTERFERING WITH THE GAME? UH, NO. WE WANT YOU GUYS TO DO IT. WHO ARE THE MINUTEMEN? THAT--THAT'S US. NEVER MIND. SO, UH... I DON'T KNOW. CHARLIE'S GONNA BE A TOUGH SELL. COME ON, VIRG. I MEAN, I KNOW WE NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT WHAT WENT DOWN THAT DAY FRESHMAN YEAR, BUT THE THING IS, I TRIED TO STOP THEM. IT WAS A RAW DEAL, MAN. I JUST WISH YOU AND I COULD GET BACK TO HOW WE USED TO BE, ALWAYS CHILLING. WHAT DO YOU SAY, MAN? SCORCH! SCORCH! HEH. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WANT TO HELP DEREK AFTER WHAT HE DID TO YOU, DID TO US! CHARLIE, IT DID NOT HAPPEN THE WAY WE THINK IT DID, AND BESIDES, IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. I'VE BEEN RUNNING SOME TESTS, AND I THINK WE MIGHT BE DAMAGING THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM. WITH ALL OUR TIME TRAVEL, AND THAT COULD CAUSE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO OUR FUTURE OR EVEN THE PLANET'S. WHAT HAPPENED TO DEREK IN THAT GAME IS ACTUALLY OUR FAULT INDIRECTLY. HE'S RIGHT, KOOKABURRA. CHESTER'S LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON AFTER YOU RESCUED HIM IN THE LOCKER ROOM. EXCELLENT POINT, JEANETTE. IS IT ME, OR HAVE I TOTALLY LOST CONTROL OF THIS PROJECT. YOU'VE LOST CONTROL, BRO. OHH! [CRASH] SORRY I'M LATE. ACTIVATING GRID. AH, YES, WE MUSTN'T FORGET THE GRAPPLING HOOK. EVERYBODY'S GOT TO MAKE FUN OF THE HOOK. WON'T BE SORRY. [WHOOSH] AAH! WHEEEE! OHH! AAH! I WILL NEVER GET TIRED OF THAT. YEAAAH! WHOA, WHOA! AAH! [GRUNTING] HEY, GUYS, YOU SEEN THIS? HA HA! UNH! A LITTLE HELP, GUYS. GUYS, A LITTLE HELP. [CROWD CHEERING ON TV] Announcer: DEREK BEAUGARD LOSES THE BALL. THERE'S A FUMBLE ON THE PLAY! AND HAMILTON'S GOT IT, AND THE HORNETS WIN! YEAH! SO BECAUSE YOU TOOK THIS TAPE WITH YOU WHEN YOU JUMPED BACK IN TIME... IT STILL EXISTS. PRETTY CLEVER, HUH? THIS IS CRAZY, MAN. I MEAN, VIRG, YOU'RE THE MAN. I GOT TO TELL THE GUYS ABOUT THIS. NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. NO. THIS IS WAY TOO BIG. THIS HAS GOT TO STAY BETWEEN US. YEAH, YEAH. NO WORRIES, BROTHER, BUT WE GOT TO CELEBRATE. I MEAN, TOMORROW, WE'RE PARTYING AT MY HOUSE, AND, VIRG, YOU GOT TO BE THERE. OHH. I WANT TO. I CAN'T, THOUGH. I'M HANGING OUT WITH CHARLIE. THE WEATHER NETWORK IS COUNTING DOWN THE TOP 1 HAILSTORMS OF ALL TIME. I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW LAME OF AN EVENING THAT WAS UNTIL I SAID IT OUT LOUD. [POP MUSIC PLAYING] OH! THANK YOU. THANKS. SO YOU HAVING FUN? OH, YEAH. I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A PARTY SINCE I WAS 10, AND I REMEMBER THE PONY THREW UP ON ME. THAT WAS MY BIRTHDAY PARTY. OH. I--I'M-- I'M KIDDING. GOOD. SO I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO THE DANCE ON SATURDAY. YEAH, I GUESS. YOU DON'T SOUND HAPPY ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW. DEREK AND I GO TO EVERY PARTY, EVERY SOCIAL GATHERING. IT'S REALLY A SICKNESS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW. BEING POPULAR SEEMS LIKE A VERY SATISFYING WAY OF LIFE. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. SOMETIMES, I WONDER IF I CHOSE THE RIGHT PATH. I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU. YOU DON'T SEEM TO MIND THAT YOU'RE... UM... CAPTAIN OF THE DORKS? I WASN'T GONNA SAY IT LIKE THAT, BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS ALWAYS LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HAVING SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. REALLY? BECAUSE FROM OUR SIDE, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE HAVING ALL THE FUN. REALLY? YEAH. HEY, VIRG! HEY! SO GOOD PARTYING WITH YOU AGAIN, MAN. THANK THOSE OTHER GUYS FOR ME, WHAT'S HIS NAME, THE BIG, SCARY GUY AND THE LITTLE TWERP. OH! DANG IT. I FORGOT TO CANCEL WITH CHARLIE. HOLD ON. LET ME CALL HIM. Girl: STEPHANIE, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. EH, HE PROBABLY FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT. [MUFFLED MUSIC PLAYING] Virgil: CHARLIE, HOW MANY MORE TIMES DO I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE? 212 TIMES OUGHT TO DO IT. CHARLIE, LISTEN. I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY. FINE. I FORGIVE YOU. LOOK. I'M JUST REALLY FRAZZLED. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE TIME MACHINE AND THE POSSIBLE RIPPLE EFFECTS. [BEEP BEEP] HANG ON, DUDE. I GOT ANOTHER CALL. I'LL GET RID OF THEM. [SIGHS] HELLO? HEY, VIRGIL. UM... I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST-- STEPH, WHAT'S WRONG? HE, UM, HE-- DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. [SIGHS] Virgil: STEPH! STEPH! STEPHANIE! [GRUNTS] I HAVEN'T DONE THIS SINCE EIGHTH GRADE. THAT WASN'T-- THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE. YOU COULD HAVE USED THE FRONT DOOR. YEAH, BUT WHAT FUN WOULD THAT BE? SO TELL ME, WHAT HAPPENED? SO DEREK GOT OUT OF PRACTICE EARLY, AND WHEN I WENT OVER TO HIS HOUSE, I SAW HIM KISSING JOCELYN LEE. OHH. STEPH. I KNEW IT, TOO. I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT. I FEEL SO STUPID. I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKE PISTACHIO NUTS, BUT IN THE RUSH TO GET OVER HERE, I ACCIDENTALLY GOT THE BAG OF PASTA SHELLS. DO YOU HAVE ANY MARINARA SAUCE? HUH? WHA--NO. I CAN GO-- I CAN GO GET SOME IF YOU... YOU'RE JOKING. IT WAS REALLY NICE OF YOU TO COME OVER, VIRG. YOU'RE AN AMAZING FRIEND. YEAH. FRIEND. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO? Derek: HEY. CAN WE JUST TALK THIS OUT? IT'S DEREK. LISTEN. I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM. I HAVE TO END IT ONCE AND FOR ALL. GOOD LUCK. HUH! UNH! [MEOW] I'M OK! THESE REPEATED IRREGULARITIES ARE ALL MAINTAINING HALF-LIFES AFTER THEIR PRIMARY INCIDENTS. HA HA! IT'S TOTALLY WEIRDSVILLE! I MEAN, IT'S SERIOUS, SIR, AND ALL OF THE FLUCTUATIONS ARE EMANATING DIRECTLY FROM SUMMERTON HIGH SCHOOL. ACTUALLY, I HAVE A THEORY ABOUT THAT. IT'S--WELL, DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ANY CONTACTS AT THE FBI? Girl: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE KIND OF SCARY AND UNAPPROACHABLE. CAN WE SIT WITH YOU? Derek: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE, MAN, I MEAN, A GREAT ATHLETE, HUGELY POPULAR. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE-- IT'S LIKE PEOPLE EXPECT ME TO PLAY THE FIELD AND CHEAT ON-- WHAT'S YOUR POINT? I DIDN'T CHEAT. JOCELYN MADE THE FIRST MOVE. SHE KISSED ME, BUT I DIDN'T KISS HER BACK. I MEAN, THAT DOES NOT COUNT AS CHEATING. THE THING IS-- AND THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN-- I WANT YOU TO GO BACK IN TIME, STOP STEPHANIE FROM BUSTING ME WITH JOCELYN. WHAT?! WHY SHOULD I? BECAUSE I MADE A BIG MISTAKE, A HUGE ONE, AND IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN, I SWEAR TO YOU. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, YOU REALLY HURT HER. I KNOW. I KNOW, AND I FEEL AWFUL, BUT STEPH AND I HAVE BEEN GOING OUT FOR A LONG TIME NOW, YOU KNOW, AND SHE'S EVERYTHING A GUY COULD EVER WANT. I'VE LIKED THAT THE 3 OF US HAVE BEEN HANGING OUT AGAIN, LIKE THE OLD DAYS, AND IT COULD STILL BE LIKE THAT, MAN. COME ON, BUDDY. WHAT DO YOU SAY? LET ME THINK ABOUT IT. YEAH. YEAH, SURE. [CAR APPROACHING] [TIRES SQUEAL] WHOA! HEY! HOLD ON! HOLD UP! Man: PUT ON YOUR SEAT BELT! [TIRES SQUEAL] I'M TELLING YOU. YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY, BUT I CAN GIVE YOU THE NAMES OF THE TWO-- I WAS GONNA GIVE THEM FAKE NAMES. I'D NEVER RAT YOU GUYS OUT. YEAH, RIGHT. MR. KEEP ME ON HOLD ALL NIGHT. Man: GOOD AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN. MY NAME IS AGENT REHNQUIST OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION. I'M GONNA LET YOU BOYS IN ON A SECRET, A NATIONAL SECRET. IN 1969 SHORTLY AFTER THE APOLLO 11 MOON LANDING, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BEGAN FUNDING A NUMBER OF NEW SCIENTIFIC PROJECTS. ONE OF THESE PROJECTS WAS TIME TRAVEL. WHAT?! TIME TRAVEL? CRAZY. THAT'S, LIKE, SO SCIENCE FICTIONY. HOLLYWOOD BALONEY. THAT'S--THAT'S NOT-- PROJECT TURNED UP FEW RESULTS AND WAS EVENTUALLY SHUT DOWN, THE FILES NEVER AGAIN TOUCHED, THAT IS, UNTIL TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN AN INDUSTRIOUS INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS BROKE INTO THE NASA MAINFRAME, USING A COMPUTER WE TRACED TO SUMMERTON HIGH SCHOOL. ALL RIGHT! I-- WHAT MY FRIEND WAS ABOUT TO SAY IS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHARGE US WITH ANYTHING, YOU CAN'T KEEP US HERE. THAT'S RIGHT. LOOK IT UP. I TOOK A SEMESTER OF GOVERNMENT. GOT A B-. I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SIR. YOU'RE JUST LETTING THEM GO? WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION JUST BY WATCHING THEM. YEAH, BUT NOW THEY KNOW WE'RE WATCHING THEM AND-- YES, SIR. EXCELLENT PLAN. OH, THIS IS BAD. OHH. REAL BAD. YEAH. WAY TO GO, NAUGHTY NED. THANKS TO YOU, WE HAVE THE FBI ON OUR BACKS. ME?! I WANTED TO STOP THIS WHOLE THING WEEKS AGO, BUT, NO, YOU HAD TO USE IT FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL GAIN! CHARLIE'S RIGHT. GOING TO PARTIES, HANGING WITH THE POPULARS. HEY. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, YOU BENEFITED FROM THIS, TOO. HOW SO? WE GAVE YOU A LIFE. BEFORE US, YOU WERE THIS BIG GUY EVERYONE WAS AFRAID OF. YOU BETTER SHUT UP, VIRGIL. SEE? YOU'RE BEING MEAN, VIRGIL. CHARLIE, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO HOME TO YOUR COMPUTER AND YOUR CAT? I WILL! GOOD LUCK ON YOUR NEW LIFE AS A POPULAR PERSON. I'M OUT OF HERE, TOO. I'M BETTER OFF ON MY OWN. I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. Charlie: WELL, THAT'S THE LAST OF THE DATA. UNFORTUNATELY, WE WON'T HAVE AN ANSWER UNTIL MORNING. [MEOW] WELL, EXCUSE ME FOR NOT HAVING A SUPERCOMPUTER! [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO? OH. HEY, DEREK. WHAT DO YOU SAY, VIRG? YOU GONNA HELP ME OUT, BUDDY? YEAH, SURE, D-ROCK. [COMPUTER BEEPING] OHH! GOOD MORNING, MAGPIE. YOUR MOM LET ME IN. IT IS SUCH A NICE DAY. YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING, MAYBE WE COULD GO ON A WALK AND TALK ABOUT OUR FUTURE TOGETHER, AND THEN--OH! I'D LIKE TO HAVE AN ORANGE HOUSE. THE RESULTS! YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE AN ADDRESS THEN, AND ON THE ENVELOPE, YOU COULD JUST SAY, "JEANETTE PAJULUSKI, ORANGE HOUSE." IT'S DONE! Jeanette: OH, UM, I'M NO SCIENTIST, BUT THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. WE CREATED A--A... A? SPIT IT OUT, BLUEBIRD! A BLACK HOLE! THAT'S BAD, RIGHT? NOW AS THE TIMELINE CONTINUES, WE SEE AN INCREASED NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES HERE IN THE SUMMERTON AREA. IF WE CAN ALL TURN TO PAGE 47, YOU CAN SEE WHERE I'VE HIGHLIGHTED-- HEY! HEY! Charlie: I LIED! I STOLE THE FORMULA FROM NASA, AND, MAN, WE'VE BEEN TIME TRAVELING ALL OVER THE PLACE. WAY AHEAD OF YOU, MR. TUTTLE. I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO MEET DRS. CONNORS AND WINTHORPE FROM THE SEISMOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT PACIFIC TECH. DOCTORS, THIS IS CHARLES TUTTLE. YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU, 9 YEARS OLD? HE'S 14! OH, WELL, THAT'S BETTER. NOW I DON'T FEEL LIKE SUCH A LOSER. SO YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THE BLACK HOLE? WHAT? THE BLACK HOLE! OH, I KNEW YOU GUYS WERE UNDERFUNDED, BUT COME ON! THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS. WE RAN THE WORST-CASE SCENARIOS SEVERAL TIMES. WE NEVER CAME UP WITH A BLACK HOLE. I SEE 5, 6 DECIMALS THAT WEREN'T CARRIED OVER. OOPS. YEAH. OOPS! EACH TIME WE USED THE MACHINE, THE RIFT CREATED IN THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM DID NOT DISAPPEAR. INSTEAD THE FLUCTUATIONS BLENDED TOGETHER TO CREATE ONE GIANT BLACK HOLE, AND THE WORST PART IS THE BLACK WHOLE WILL SPREAD UNTIL IT SWALLOWS UP SUMMERTON, THEN THE NORTHWEST, THEN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. [GULP] AND SO ON. HOW MUCH TIME TILL ZERO HOUR? ACCORDING TO MY ESTIMATES, WE HAVE... WE HAVE LESS THAN 4 HOURS TILL THE END OF THE WORLD. OK, PEOPLE, WE'RE GOING TO CODE RED. GET WASHINGTON ON THE PHONE NOW. THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO REVERSE IT, BUT IT'S A LONG SHOT. WELL, LET'S HEAR IT...SIR. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Stephanie: I'M SO EXCITED FOR THE DANCE TONIGHT, VIRG.

[RUMBLING] [THUNDER] [THUNDER] VIRGIL, THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. COME ON! [THUNDER] WE NEED TO GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF HERE NOW! Virgil: SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE AND CLOSE IT? AS FAR AS I CAN FIGURE, IT'S THE ONLY WAY. WE'LL TAKE THE REMOTE PACK WITH US AND REVERSE THE POLARITY ONCE WE LAND. WHAT REMOTE PACK? I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A NEW WAY TO CONTROL OUR JUMPS FROM THE OTHER SIDE. OK. HOLD THE PHONE. WE CANNOT LET THESE STUDENTS GO IN THAT THING. THEY COULD DIE! WE HAVE NO CHOICE. THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES FAMILIAR WITH THE EQUIPMENT. IF THEY DON'T GO, THEN WE COULD ALL DIE. GODSPEED. [THUNDER] YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M THE ONE WHO MESSED EVERYTHING UP. I'LL GO ALONE. CHARLIE AND ZEKE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS? I INVENTED IT! I HELPED! NO, YOU DIDN'T. YEAH, I DID. YOU PAINTED. THAT'S IT. EXCUSE ME. NO! NO, YOU DIDN'T. Rehnquist: OK, OK. ENOUGH, ENOUGH! YOU'LL BOTH GO. YOU'LL BE NEEDING ME, TOO, SIR, AND MY HOOK. YAAH! [CHEERING] LISTEN, GUYS. ONCE WE REVERSE THE WORMHOLE'S POLARITY, THERE'S NO WAY OF MEASURING HOW QUICKLY IT WILL CLOSE. IT COULD STAY OPEN FOR SEVERAL MORE MINUTES, OR IT COULD VANISH INSTANTANEOUSLY, AND EVEN IF WE DO MAKE IT BACK ALIVE, THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WE'LL RETURN EXACTLY TO THE POINT IN TIME THAT WE EXITED FROM. AYE, AYE, SEÑOR POSITIVE. GOOD LUCK, ZEKE. OHH! SO, VIRGIL, I HEAR YOU'RE TRYING TO SAVE THE WORLD. THAT'S RIGHT. YOUR BIG BROTHER'S PRETTY COOL, HUH? WHEN YOU DIE, CAN I HAVE YOUR ROOM?

OF COURSE! THIS IS THE DAY THAT A MODULE OF QUANTA ACCELERATION FIRST INTERACTED WITH THE SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM. THE ROCKET CAR, REMEMBER? IT LIKED THE WORMHOLE FROM OUR PRESENT TO THIS MOMENT IN THE PAST. IN A FEW MOMENTS, OUR YOUNGER SELVES-- UH, DUDE. DON'T DO IT, VIRGIL. VIRG, NO! VIRG, COME ON. ARE YOU HONESTLY THINKING OF STOPPING WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE? WHY NOT? ISN'T THAT WHAT MINUTEMEN DO, UNDO MISTAKES? WELL, I MADE A MISTAKE DOWN THERE. I HAVE A CHANCE TO BE SOMEBODY. OK, BUT KNOW THIS. WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE IS WE BECAME FRIENDS. THAT DAY THAT WE WERE TIED UP TOGETHER ON THAT STUPID RAM STATUE, THIS DAY, THIS DAY THAT YOU HATE SO MUCH JUST BECAUSE YOU GOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSED, THIS IS MY FAVORITE DAY. EVEN THOUGH I'D STILL BE A NERD, IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER ANYMORE BECAUSE NOW I HAD A REAL FRIEND. THAT WOULD ALWAYS MAKE EVERYTHING OK. SO MUCH FOR ALWAYS, I GUESS. LISTEN. LISTEN, VIRG, YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO HERE, AND IF THINGS AREN'T THE SAME ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S BEEN A GOOD RIDE. Derek: HEY, GUYS, WAIT. YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I'VE GOT A MUCH BETTER IDEA. I MEAN, WHY DON'T WE SMEAR THIS ALL OVER THEM? [CHEERING] LOSERS! [BEEPING] NO! NO! THE CLOSURE RATE OF THE VORTEX JUST WENT INTO OVERDRIVE. HOLD ON. YOU'RE TELLING ME-- IF THAT THING TOUCHES THE GROUND, WE'LL BE TRAPPED HERE FOR GOOD. WHAT ABOUT VIRGIL? THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL MAKE IT TO HIM AND BACK TO THE VORTEX IN TIME! CHARLIE!
