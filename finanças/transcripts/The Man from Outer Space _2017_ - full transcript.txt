Oh!! Ah!! Oh! Get in the game Louis. Louis!? Louis!? What is it? I just had a great story idea. You can't even sleep without working can you? You ready? Yeah, just finishing up my homework. Ok, wrap it up. Come on, lets go. How does this tie look? I think you should lose it. I always where this tie. Yeah, but it's not going to go with that suit. You're trying to hard to look like Kyle. Ha. I can feel it ladies, this is the one. You always say that. Well, after today it'll be fact! Alright, don't forget Makayla has her play tonight and you promised to help her with her short film script. Ok, ok, got it. Do your best at the meeting, it will be nice to have you back on the weekends. Come here, love you. Good luck. Ready? Okay.Yeah. Love you daddy! Love you too. Louis! Get in the game. Yeah...yeah, sorry. Take that tie off! What? Why? Because I'm wearing a tie, you don't need too. This is my favorite tie. It might intimidate him...take it off! Yours won't? I'm required to wear a tie. You should look more disheveled. I've always worn this tie in a meet - Harold will be with you in just moment. Thank you... not in this one. Harold! Jeff. Kyle... Ah. Harold this is my client Louis. -Louis. -Ah, pleasure to meet you Harold. You boys want anything to drink? We're good, thank you. Ice green tea, no sweetener. Harold, I just want to say thank you for having us here today. Louis and I are both very excited that you are interested in his script-- I'm not. Let me handle this. Harold, you seem to have caught us a little bit off guard here, if um, if you are not interested in the script then... We're looking for out of the box stories, but within the box of the mainstream audiences right that's disaster pictures, espionage thrillers, superhero pictures, astronaut pictures. Your script doesn't fit those categories. So... So, do you have any scripts that do? Your writing's got heart. I'm sure you've got a script up your sleeve that's more mainstream. Yes!Well not at the moment - Let me handle this. Uh, yes Harold, I do. Actually, I have an astronaut film. Great. Send it over Kyle. I'll have my interns read it this weekend. Oh, well Harold, it's not quite finished yet... We'll have it to you Monday. Louis just has to put the final touches on it. Great. I'll see you then. Ah, thank you. I said no sweetener. What the hell was that!? That..that was me saving us, that's what that was! Louis, you don't have a space script! Then why did you say we would have one by Monday!? Because I want to make a deal. Ok. And it's either his way or no way. Alright!? Harold has zero patience. None! So it's either you play ball or he kicks you out of the game! See this is why you need to let me handle these situations - you don't get these exec types... I get them well enough Kyle! Ok, alright, you know what? You're right, you're older more experienced, have gone to what? Twelve failed meetings? Sure, you got this buddy. Good luck with the script, see ya at the movies! Kyle? Kyle! Wait, Kyle! I got anxious ok? I'm sorry. It's just...it's just earlier, I had this idea about an astronaut who crash lands onto earth - Louis ok right! I'll get you a deal. If you can get this script to me, written, by Monday. And Harold goes for it, some reason goes for it. I'll keep you as my client. But if he doesn't, you can't get your shit together, I'm going to drop you. Kyle! Who are we kidding? I'm your only client. I have five now, thank you. I can cut my losses where I need it. And I think an unsold, stubborn writer who bounces from agent to agent, counts as that. Hope you don't have any plans this weekend. -Hey dad. -Hey. Guess what? I'm almost done with my script. Ugh, I wish I could say the same. Mom home? No, not yet. Ok, well when she gets here tell her I'll be in the office working all weekend. Dad? What? Did you seriously forget? Forget what? Forget what? You know what, I don't have time for these little games, Daddy's got work to do. Hey, how was school? Good. Good. Dad home? Yes ma'am, he forgot again. Did he really? Mmhmm. Ok, I'll talk to him. How's your short film script coming? It's good. I'm almost finished. I was hoping dad and I could read it, but I don't think he's going to have the time. Louis? Hey. You can't work again this weekend. Honey, I have to. The RLO exec likes my writing, but, they want something a little more mainstream. That's great honey but, Makayla has a play tonight and a soccer game tomorrow, and she's trying to get her short film script - Oh...is that what I forgot? Yes! Alyssa...I can't, ok. I have to have this script done by Monday or else I'll lose my chance and Kyle. You can barely stand Kyle. But he's the only option I've got. Well, can you take a break and try to make it out to both events? I don't know, I mean, I could always catch another soccer game? You haven't been to one this season. That's not fair, come on. You know I have been working alright, I am on the crux of this. Everything I've been dreaming about, everything I've been working on lies in this script. Well can you ask for a couple more days? Makayla needs you this weekend. Ok. Umm... Ill take a break, alright, I'll come out to the play, but that's the best I can do. What about her short film? I can't help her with that, she needs you Louis. I'll make something happen, ok. I love you, alright? -Wait, you know Monday is-- -Two days from now, yeah. No, its-- -Alyssa, please? I have to get this done. Oh, oh, oh! Control, control? Control, this is 5099, pilot of solo mission Origin. Upon entrance on Earth's atmosphere my ship suffered fractures causing a malfunction and a crash landing into an undetermined body of water. I by some miracle survived and have a enough supplement to sustain me for a week. All other supplies were lost with the ship. If anyone is hearing this, please send rescue. I have decided that I will continue on with my mission. I will forge into the intercontinent to study the topography, the ecosystem, and the atmospheric conditions to see if this planet really is worthy of re...re- inhabiting. Turning on my homing beacon now...hoping it still works. Ah, please hurry. 5099 over and out. Ehhh...a little wordy. Well, we'll see about that! Louis... Louis! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Time got away from me, I forgot. Forget has been a popular word with you lately. Alyssa... this might be my last chance. You're a good writer. But nothing is selling! Nothing! Half the time you didn't have an agent. Half the time I did...and what do I have to show for it? I can feel this one, you know, this one is different, this one is unique. You say that about all of them, you just said that last weekend about the one you just pitched. Alright no, you're right. I'll just throw in the towel, I'll just be a stay at home dad, you be the career woman. That sounds great. You know that's not what I'm saying. What are you saying then Alyssa!? Oh, I'm sorry I must have forgot. What I'm saying is that Makayla needs you to be present in her life. I am in her life! Can you remember the last time you were at any event she was involved in? Neither can we. I'm not asking you to give up your career, I'm asking you to every once in a while, put us in front of it. Makayla especially, she's growing up, she's talking to boys, she wants to be a filmmaker. Alyssa... if you can just give me this weekend, I promise you, I will do better, I will be the filmmaker she deserves to look up to. Sure whatever you say Louis. You're definitely a man of your word. Where do you think you are going? You'll thank me later. Makayla! Why'd you marry him again? Yeah! Yeah, send me, no? No one else wants to go. Please! Send me captain! Yeah, I know there's nothing there, but still! Let me go, because, I'm a genius and you guys are -- Idiots, and I'm the genius, I'm the genius! Control, this is 5099 pilot of solo mission Origin, I don't know if you received the memo but I am stranded here on Earth, please send rescue, over. Control, this is 5099 pilot of solo mission Origin, I'm getting a little chaffed here... some ointment would be greatly appreciated, over. Roger that 5099, we received your transmission and will be sending spa treatment right away over? You will!? I'm saved! I'm saved! Oh! Aw! Oh. I am gonna make it, I gotta make it. You hear that control. I'm going to make it to that ridge, by nightfall, and then, I'm probably going to die. Um, Excuse me sir, Uhh we're closing up now. Oh, man, I'm sorry. Come on, don't stop. Don't stop. What happens next, what happens next., what happens next. Oh oh oh ahhh! Hello? Hey champ how's it going? Oh, it's going, I'm on page twenty six. Woah! Now we're cooking with gas! Grff, yeah, I um, I don't know man, I just don't know what happens next, I'm kinda stuck. Woah, woah, woah. Louis, Louis you don't have time to be stuck, clock is ticking. Did you call just to harass me, Kyle? Hey man, I just wanted to see how you were doing. Glad to hear you're staying focused. Talk to you soon.LOUIS: Wait, before you go... what time? Hello? Anybody home? Uhh, Thank God. There was not enough time. ...they weren't even trying Hey! I know that's when... How was the game!? Did you win? Makayla? Hey. Did they win or lose? Alyssa? Ok, I see what's happening, the silent treatment? Ok, you want to play the silent treatment, I can too. Bottoms up. Control, this is 5099, pilot of solo mission Origin. After several days of walking through an undetermined continent of earth I have found the atmosphere rather dense, oxygen levels high, sustainable organic growth. I am halting my expedition due to lack of food supplies. I will set up a primitive base camp here at the coordinates in which I hope you are receiving this message. I see a clearing in which a ship can properly land. Be wary of steep entry, the atmosphere is much denser than expected, the shields will not hold. Ahh, I guess that's it. Thank you control. Oh, one other thing. Oompf.... Ahhhhh...hmmm. Ahhh... Huh. Ahh. Hey..ok, hey look, I'm unarmed alright. Can you, can you understand me? Ok. Alright. I'm... I'm just going to sit down right here. Oh! Wow! Dinner looks great. Mmmm...what did you get on it? B minus It's ok, I know it was hard. Yeah... Mmmm...May I join you? Aren't we being a little cruel? You don't have to join me, I just can't talk to him right now Come on, finish your dinner. So... are there more, people, like you, around here? Do you have names? My name is 5099. I come from up there. Yeah, alright at least I'm getting some vital signs. Uhh, I come from a place called Mars. There are millions and millions of people like you and I there. Well, We all come from here, but thousands of years ago Earth was overpopulated and diseased, and world wide wars broke out. And the earth was destroyed. But my, your ancestors found a new home for us. The fact that you are here is an absolute miracle. Great. You make the greatest discovery of the century and they are simpletons that understand absolutely nothing. Control, this is 5099 pilot of solo mission Origin, I have found life on Earth! Repeat, I have found two human specimens both female on earth. No signs as of yet of any male counterparts or other inhabitants. Please hurry. I will continue to study them in the meantime. 5099 over and out. Rise and shine. Hey, how are-- wait no no no! I thought we were friends now, hmm? Now that's how you go fishing. Haha...oh, yeah, too soon, I felt that. Thanks Mom. Dad did this. Haha, good one. No, really, I didn't do this. Really? So... do either of you have a name? Didn't think so. Just checking...again. Thought you two would open up a little bit more by now. Well... I think you two deserve the honor of having names... What do you think? I'll take that as a yes. Okay, you... your name will be, I don't know. How about Ava? Yeah, Ava that's an old fashion earth name right? Ok, Ava it is. And you little one, since you are so small. Haha, how about we call you Minnie? Minnie, Minnie, Minnie, Minnie. Oh my God, you both can understand me can't you? Come in. Hey. Hey. Talking now huh? Making breakfast now huh? Yeah, I cooked the eggs a little too long? Yeah. It's alright though. How's it going? Not too bad, I've got about 40 pages, I need to have about 30 by 9am tomorrow. Ouch. Yeah. Well I'll leave you to it. Hey Makayla, I'm sorry about all this. Once I'm finished with this I promise you I will focus more on you and mom, ok. Hey! I got an idea, how about I read you my script like I used to, remember? Nah, hey, how about you help me with my short film on Tuesday? Short film? You're making a short film on Tuesday? Dad! I told you two weeks ago. I know. Look, I promise you I'll help you out and I will read the script beforehand ok. Whatever dad. Oh, I'll whatever you! Control, this 5099 pilot of solo mission origin, after spending several weeks studying and interacting closely with Ava and Minnie, I have found that they are naturally intelligent, although our lack of ability to communicate is immense, they seem to understand me, and I am beginning to understand them. I will push to continue to find out where their male counterparts are and if they know or know of any humans in the region. 5099 over and out. Ok, here's me, here's you, here's Minni. Where are these people. Oh, Ok, lovely, very nice, Ava thank you, so much, listen to me though, Ava... where are these people? Hmm? Three? A third? Where are they? Can you take me to them? Owww! Is that your husband? Ava, I'm sorry. Are there any others? Besides these three? Makayla, let's go!?" Hold on! Hey where you guys- Hello? Hey playa! How's it going? It's going. Yeah, you finished yet? Uh, 47. Yes! Yeah, not too bad. it could be worse. No! Not you! 47 that's it? Harold called this morning, just checking in. Yeah? Yeah, so, are you going to finish? I don't know man, I'm pretty beat and I haven't spent any time with my family this weekend. Family!? Louis, your career is at stake and you are worried about your family? Ugh, you wouldn't understand? Oh no, no, no, I completely understand. So you're going to commit to a project that might as well just be your career and then flake out because you love your family? Wow, way to provide to for them Louis. You listen here you little prick, everyday I am working my ass off following these wild goose chase lead you have me on, what makes this any different!? Because you took the lead on this one pal! Kyle!? Kyle!? Serves up bad boy! Ah! Control? Control? I don't think they are coming for me Ava. It's my fault, it was my idea. While other missions were going off to other possible inhabitable planets I chose the one we destroyed. No one else thought it was fertile, I was the only fool who did and they sent me on my merry way. But clearly, even in the worst of times it was fertile, or else you wouldn't be here. What am I complaining about. Louis? Hey. What are you doing? Watching the fire. Inspiration? Yeah, I guess. I'm almost finished. Good. Do you know what it's called? Mmmhmm. The Man From Outer Space. Do you know how it ends? I think so. I just don't know what the main character is going to decide. You will, goodnight. Goodnight. I lov- Ahhhhh! Ava! Wait! It's alright... Captain? 307? Who are these people? You were on a solo mission? I can't believe you are here!? 5099, get ahold of yourself. Ava, no no no no. Ava, Ava, no it's ok. These, these are the indigenous people I was telling you about in my transmissions. What transmissions? We've received nothing since your last distress call. Your com gauntlet was damaged in the crash. I guess, but how did you find me? Beacon, placed under your skin. Standard procedure for situations like this. You lit up as soon as we hit the atmosphere. Well thank God you're here. You have to believe me they are not going to hurt you, ok these are my colleagues. They're here to help us. You don't know how good it feels to see you both. How long have you been with them? What? How long have you been with the indigenous? Ava and Minnie, about fifteen weeks now. You've named them? Well they don't have any language, I had to refer to them by something. I don't know what you were thinking. From now on they will be called Female 1 and Female 2. They are not your family. They are a scientific discovery and need to be studied properly, not fraternized with. I...I was studying them, but I didn't have the supplies to study them from afar. Go back to the ship, get yourself cleaned up. We have food supplements and medical supplies onboard. We'll watch female one and female two. After you are ready, you will escort us and the females back to whatever habitat they have occupied. This is the greatest scientific find of the century. I thought for sure he was lying. So, what's your plan? Go back to the habitat. Assess. Decide who to take with us. How do I look? Tired. The suit. Good. No tie? Did you finish? No. Well what do you think's going to happen? I don't know. I'm hoping they are going to like it and give me few a days to work on it. Shouldn't you be getting ready for work? No. Taking a sick day? No. Why aren't you getting ready? I tried to tell you Friday, it's Labor Day. Why didn't you tell me? I tried to tell you but you wouldn't listen. I know I was distracted, but you could have tried a little harder! Don't you dare shout at me! Yasss. That's good. Speak. It's labor day. Yeah, so. So we're not having a meeting with Harold today are we? Of course not, Harold is on his way back from Bermuda. Louis? I have slept, maybe... maybe six hours since Friday, all because you said that I had to have a feature film script done by today. Oh, ok, I'm pretty sure Harold said that and you agreed to it. I would think that as my agent maybe you would help me to understand that he actually meant Tuesday! Listen, you were the one that took control on this remember. If you would have just let me handle this, it would have been different. Get me the script by today, I'll get it to Harold, we'll go from there. This is your career Louis, don't get sidetracked. Oh, harder baby, harder, yah that's it...money. I don't have time for this! Jerk. You're gonna let me say that? Now from what I have noticed, they are a nomadic people, although they stay contained in one area for several days at a time, they are very intelligent, although they don't have any language of their own, they seem to understand fine. Have you tried any other languages? A few, yes, but they don't seem to understand any. They mostly communicate through eye movement, hand gestures, occasional grunts. No males? Males are dead. Have you studied the ecology of this place? How did you know the males were deceased? It's obvious, if there was a male specimen here they would have killed you instead of taking you in. What's their diet? Uh, nuts, fruit, primarily, occasional animal meat. Ah, 307? It will be nightfall soon will it not? Yes, why? We have to leave before then. Oh? 5099, control sent us on a rescue mission. They gave us supplies but not enough for a few days here, the trip back is- Twelve weeks, I know. We only have room for one other passenger. Ok, Well we could leave a communications device here so they can hear my voice. We could set up the com right here, we could setup a wind turbine right... here. Female two. I'm sorry what was that? We're not taking you. I'm sorry? We're taking female two. Minnie? No, no. You can't do that. What about her mother? You will stay here with the mother. We'll set up a com station, return in a few months. Leave. Leave the supplies for the third passenger with me, I can distribute them appropriately that way I can stay here and study them in their natural habitat. This is the greatest discovery in decades, Earth is inhabitable. We have to take one back to study it, can't you see that? I understand that, but you cannot break this family apart. You mean their family? Yes, their family. This is not our choice, this decison comes straight from control. 5099, this is your career at stake. You will be known as the man, the explorer, who re-discovered earth, our homeland. Nobody believed you, do you want to let that opportunity slip through your fingers? Ok, ok, lets do it. Can I talk to them first? Ava, darling you and Minnie mean so much to mankind and I know you can't understand this yet, but your existence is what will allow the prosperity of our race. We have to study, ok, and we won't be able to do that here for another several months, so, in order to make their, our work faster, we have to take her. They need to take Minnie. Wait, no! Huh. Don't touch them. This not how you do this! Stand down 5099. I will not stand down! This is not your call, Major! I suggest that if you want to be remembered as the man who rediscovered Earth you step aside and let us do what we came here for. Came here for? You said this was a rescue mission. You sly devils, you got all my transmissions didn't you? Your job is to stand down! Liars! I finished it, I finished it! I finished it! It doesn't have to be this way. Then do something about it. I sent the script to Kyle, meeting is tomorrow, 1pm. Makayla's shoot starts at 4PM. I know, I know, I'll be there. She's counting on you. Ava! Ava! Stop. Ava, Stop, Ava listen. I'm sorry it was my job ok! I shouldn't have done it, but I had to. Ava, Ava I'll leave okay, but I can't promise you that they are going to bring her back to you! Where's that stick you hit me with? How was your weekend? Was Good, was very good. Quite relaxing actually. How was Bermuda? Your script Louis. Very original. Thank you. So my interns tell me. Unfortunately, it's not quite what I had in mind. This is a family film, that's not something we do here. Would you consider developing it with us further? Get it to where you would like it to be. I'm confident this can be more than just a family picture. I have the afternoon free. Convince me. You look concerned Louis. I'm telling you we should have gone west. The ship is half mile east of the camp. We would have been there in 30 minutes if that were the case. Calm down. Here, take her I'll figure this out. Have you lost your nerve sergeant? Don't talk to me like that, put the girl down. Get out the beacon. We should have taken 5099 with us, he would have brought us back. I'm not the one that hit him. 5099? It's nothing. Get on with it. Neutralize. Oh... Oh... Think they got that transmission? What'd you say champ, you ready to make this happen? Louis, you gone deaf, or you just excited? He's just excited. You have to do this. This is your career on the line. Louis, say something? Ok, yeah, yeah let's do it. You're such a fool. You'll be court marshaled. Your career is over. What does it matter if I don't have a family to share it with? Ok, alright they shouldn't be following us anymore. Louis, Louis? Harold asked you a question. I'm so sorry, A.D.D I guess. Page seventy three... other than guilt perhaps, what is 5099's motivation to chase after his colleagues and the child, that seems abrupt. Well, I think it's because he's realized how important Minnie is to her mother, and to he himself. Ok, alright, in that case he doesn't get to stay with them in the end. Stay still Jill! I am! Mom, what do you think? Um, shouldn't she be in the center of the frame? No, rule of thirds. Oh, well your dad should be here any minute, he can give you more tips. Ok... How long is this going to take? It's art Jill, just let it breathe. Well I've only got two hours. I know. So 5099, leaves them at the end? Rescues them, but then the guilt that he has causes him go his own way because he cares for them. Exactly. The best love stories are the ones where the people in love don't get to stay together. No, they need him. Do they? Seems to me they're getting along just fine until he crashes into their life. And cut. We're going to go for another take, but this time, whistle while you read. Where is dad? I need him for my next shot. Ava and Minnie need a husband and a father. But, in order to protect them he has to leave. Otherwise it wraps up a little too neatly. Life is never like that, life is never simple. A final conflict at the end will really hit home. Woah, They won't be able to track you anymore, but they can track me. So I need you to stay here. Ok? Don't follow me. No, no, no! Yeah, I like that. Harold, that's beautiful. So, story aside, apart, lets talk a little about a preliminary ballpark for a price range on an option. He can't afford to hurt them again. What? You're absolutely right, 5099 has to what's best for the family. He has to leave or else they're in danger. Now you're talking. Yeah, but I'm not 5099... I have to go to my family. Excuse me. Louis? Louis? Louis, Louis, woah woah woah, what are you doing? Hey, I, listen I think we have him right where we want him so, how about you take over for now, you're in charge. What are you talking about? My daughter is doing her first short film today and she kind of needs me to be there. Listen, You and I both know he wouldn't be spending all this time if he wasn't interested in the script. Huh? Bring it home for us partner. I'll have a new draft in a couple of days, Harold see you soon. Kyle. Sir. That is one ballsy client you have there, I like him. Thank you. Trevor! Iced green tea. No sweetener. Yes sir. No sweetener. Would you like a drink? He did it. That son of a gun did it. -Hey hey! -Where are you? Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm just stuck in a little traffic, I'll be there. It's 4:30 Louis, she's got an hour and a half to finish this. I'll make it happen, alright. I'll see you soon, I promise. Well hurry up! He's not coming is he. Just do the best you can without him. Jill! Hey I'm here! Alyssa! Makayla, what can I help with? I read your script babe, it's amazing. Go to your room. No no no, please stay. I'm here ok, look, I know I messed up, Alyssa? I can't wait to see your movie babe. Hmmm. Going to my room now. Hey dad... Hey... Read me your script? Yeah, absolutely! You know what... I got a better idea. How about you show me your film, I'll read you my script later. Deal. Ok, lets go. Huh, oh my gosh, this is good, this is good. You think it's this easy to stroll in like this!? Hey... I was just about to read her my script if you wanted to join us? Don't act like you're out of the woods yet! At least I've landed. He pants and looks around the beach, bits of wreckage from his craft scatter the sand. Some large, some small. Slowly calming, he looks ahead and sees in front of him, a tall mountain of sand. He studies it, then drops to his knees, face whitening with desperation. He blinks and seems to be clearly contemplating his situation. He lifts his arm and starts hitting a cracked touch pad on his wrist. It finally comes to life, sort of. He speaks into it. Control... do you read me Control? Please send rescue.
