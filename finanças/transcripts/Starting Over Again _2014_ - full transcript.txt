Let's go. They said you were nothing but a severe headache. Rizal's sister took his remains from here in Paco Park, and transferred them to Luneta. But it was too late. It had decayed. He looked at me. Wait for me! - Bye, sir. - Okay. - Sir. - Ginny! Go and woo him. Sir! Wait. - This will be quick, I promise. - Ms. Gonzales... Wait! I promise this will be quick. Just wait. Here... Oh! Move here. There. Sir, I don't want this to decay like Rizal's letter, because I believe if you have something to say, you should say it right away. I love you, sir. Today, February 14, 2004, will mark the history of our romance. Next year, it's gonna be "Happy Anniversary", okay? Always the playful one, Ms. Gonzales. Thank you. I've been in love with you for almost four years, sir. Ever since the first day of our history class. Someday, I hope you realize that. How will he realize it if you don't send him that? Send what? You can email yourself or another person. And you can specify the date you want to receive it. What date? It depends. Could be weeks, months, or even years from the day you wrote the email. The problem with Ginny is that she's written Marco a hundred times now but she hasn't got the guts to send it. Hey. Of course I'm gonna send it. - Then let's do it now. - No. - No! Don't do it. - I'm really going to send this. Isn't it beautiful? Yes, sir. I hope so, too. - Let's go over there, ma'am. - Okay. Thank you. Congratulations to you too. My grandma owns that house. I know, sir. That's why I'm asking you if I can use her house as the subject matter of my thesis next year. Come on... You know... I've been to three bookstores now, but no, I still can't find that book. Too bad. I need it for a reference. Sir. As I was saying, for my thesis next year, your grandma's house... - I got you fried bananas... - Oh, bananas! Ms. Lala Lioness ate you alive again. - Aren't they together? - Of course not. This is a jail booth, not a marriage booth. I'll just borrow it. There's no handcuffs in the marriage booth. - I'll return them to you right away. - No. This is 150 pesos. You only gave me 50 pesos. - I don't have any more money. - Me neither. I'm broke. We already gave up our jeepney fares so you could follow Sir Marco into the horror booth. - There are ants all over you. - Hey! Get your hands off me. Hey! Stop it. Hey! Wait. Sir, please choose Ms. Lala... Sir. She's not yet paid! You can't get married. She's a cheater. Sir, we've fully paid. You have to marry Ms. Lala. Sir, she's really a cheater. You've been ignoring him for so long. You said he has one year to enjoy himself. It hasn't been a year. Sure. Sir Marco. Ms. Torres. Are you done enrolling? Not yet, sir. The queue is still long. Sir! Ginny... Ouch. Ms. Gonzales. Do you still want to use our house for your thesis? Yes. Four generations of our family have lived here. That's why almost all of us became teachers. A lot of things happened in this house. In World War II... - Ma... - What took you so long? We got stuck in traffic. - Did you bring pudding? - Yes, it's with Marco. Ginny, my parents. This is Ginny. Ginny. You want some pudding? No, sir. I'm still full. You were saying? You see the Pasig River? Papa used to tell us before, where you can rest and spend time with your family. We love this house. Too bad... Only few of its kind have survived through the years. Don't sell it. We're also there most of the time because we're building a school there. Anyway, it's only Marco who stays here. Yes. The nearest public transport is three blocks away. And every block, there are men drinking. I'll take you home. Where's your dorm? Oh, no. I go home during weekends to my father. Where does he live? In Batangas. - In Batangas? - Yes. You can't take it back anymore. You said you'd drive me home. That one with the open gate. - You take care, okay? - Yes, don't worry. Why did you change? You bitch. Oh! Papa. Pa! This is the theme song of my mama and papa. My papa plays this song when: A. He's happy or B. He's sad. Oh! No... no need. I'm okay. Papa and I have a routine. Pa. You have to stand up. - Let's go! - Your mother called. She missed talking to you again. You made me admire you more when you let me see your world. What took you so long to arrive? There you go again, Pa. I thought we'd moved on already? Mama's already happy in Spain. Stop hoping already. We've already talked about this. I don't know what worked more for you. Your persistence or your prayers? But Ma'am Elsa, does she look like Mama Mary? I think it's because you prayed so hard. Stop, stop, stop! From the top, we need energy. And that's my last Christmas at this university. That's today. So, I have an ultimatum? Actually, until December 25, sir. Here. This is my favorite part of your letter. "They say, But if you feel nothing for me, Sir, if you're going to reject me, can you not do it today? Because this is going to be my second rejection. It's too painful already. You got rejected? They said, I don't look like Mama Mary, so I didn't get the role in the play. Well, that's what they think. But for me... What? Yes. You're my boyfriend now? Yes. I'm your girlfriend now? Sir! If you only knew. Can I kiss you know? - Okay. - Yes. I don't know why... Or how... Or when it started. What happened to the two of us? Why did we break up? Why did you leave me? You will have been to places. You will have met a lot of people. You will have accomplished things. I hope you have done everything you wanted. I hope four years is enough for you to be sure that I'm the one you want to be with for the rest of your life. I'll wait for you, Ginny. I'll wait, knowing that one day, Hi, Aunt Ginny. Are you okay? This email was sent in 2009, so four years ago? - Is there really a website like that? - Right there. I've been searching for him for so long. On Facebook... I even Googled "Marco Villanueva" to no avail. Now see, he made his way back to Ginny, - But is this still true now? - Not anymore. How come? So he was just emotional when he wrote it in the past. Yes! Past. That's the operative word. This was the past and that's the end of the story. What if their love story is "to be continued"? Come on! Stop romanticizing things, Wella. This isn't a soap opera. Wait, so what really happened to them? The point is, this isn't helping Ginny move on. So let's stop this. - We have to delete this. - No! Not now. Who knows? There might be another chance. You two are crazy. Baba, please help me here. Goodness. That's why I never liked the idea. Too many things are holding you down. Here in Barcelona, you had a nice job. Then you left everything. Ma, I came back here because I need to take care of Papa. Sometimes, I think you're just using him as an excuse. Truth is, you just want to see Marco. Happy birthday, big sister. Tell me, Ma. Didn't you regret leaving Papa? Is it Throwback Thursday today? I don't think so. You never thought of coming back to him? Pa, why don't you just live here in Manila? If it's inconvenient for you to go to Batangas... That's not what I meant, Pa. Come on. Have you still not forgiven me? That I left you? I'm used to being left behind. Pa! You... Pa, I was talking to Mama... she said there was a time that she almost came back to us. But she was afraid that we might not take her back. If she had come back, would you have forgiven her? Would you have taken her back? How can I answer that? She never said that. What if she did? It never happened. But what if? Yes. Oh! This is huge. He also has a restaurant in Paranaque. That was the first one. Ah... Milo? Migo. Migo Manego. They're here, sir. Ginny. - Hey, how are you? - Hey, Ali. - Ginny! How are you? - Hi. They are Marco's friends from culinary school. I'm okay! I have two kids now... - Hi. - You? You're looking great. We'll be meeting with him today, and Marco. - Marco? - Yes, Marco. He's our executive chef. He's here... We're in one building together. We're breathing the same air. Why is this happening to me? We can say no and just leave. She's right. But Beb, I want to see him again. I want to know why. Why what? Why did we have to see each other again? JR, your pork is lacking something. You take charge. How are you? Gosh, I can't believe you're starting a restaurant. We also can't believe that you're married. He was very persistent. He followed me to Dubai. - Wow. - You know... true love... I didn't know you worked in Paris. After I studied in New York, yes. You also went to Spain? Then last year, I came home here. We're planning to open a new restaurant. My first with Ali. We've gone through a lot of architects but nobody suits Marco's taste. Then I saw you in a mall. So I joked with Marco about... hiring you as our architect, - and he agreed. - Yes. I'm glad you agreed. We're a one-stop shop. We have architects and a contractor. I don't want to brag, but Ginny has a master's degree. She went abroad and studied for two years in Barcelona. What property are we converting into a restaurant? The old house in Santa Ana. Well, that's why I called for you guys, because we want to know if you can do it. That's too soon. - Leave it. - We're following a timetable. We forgot to tell you that... the restaurant is not just owned by the four of us. There's another part-owner. Patricia De Guia. Marco's girlfriend. But when she gets back, because it's really her and Marco's idea. You? What's your secret? You want the truth? Maybe it's that... even though I love Papa so much... I sometimes wish I had a different father. Someone... Who has a strong heart. Who wouldn't come home from Saudi, after two years... just because he missed his family. Someone who wouldn't give up when he lost in business. Maybe then Mom wouldn't have left to work abroad. Maybe... Maybe then, our family would've still been together. What are you doing there? Hey, sir. Is everything okay, sir? A cat. Go away! There was a cat. A noisy cat. A flirty cat. Me, I want to be a chef. Why don't you study culinary arts? Try it. Come on. You can be an Iron Chef. - You think? - Yes. You're good. And you'll make a lot of people happy. Taste it. It's delicious. - What do you remember? - What? What thoughts come to mind when you tasted that? Um... happy thoughts. Just like... A celebration, a feast! Like that. Isn't it amazing? I've always loved how food can preserve a memory. Even food has history? How about me? What taste will make you remember me? Oh, well. I have to taste you first. Really? Of course. So I'll know the taste. Salty... appetizing. Sour... the taste of romance. Sweet... the taste of love. Delicious. The taste of forever. Ouch. Sorry. Sorry. Goodness. What's that noise? - What? - I envy you. We're legal now! What if, instead of letting your grandma sell this house, you turn it into a restaurant? I can see it. The two of us. My wife is really talented. - Hmm? - What? Don't you want to be Mrs. Villanueva? Why? Why, Ginny? Because... You were stupid. You were so stupid. You were his girlfriend already and you let go of him. You did nothing for four years. You didn't write to him. You didn't call him. You were full of pride. Pride! You courted him for so long. You were too proud of yourself... You think you're beautiful? Look at your jaw. Maybe you were just afraid? That's not an excuse. It's still the same. You're stupid! Stupid. Maybe you were afraid of getting rejected? You were too slow. Somebody got to him first. There's a new woman. A new one! I'm so tired of crying... Beb is right. I have to move on. This email isn't true. I have to delete you. I have to delete you from my life. Go on, Ginny... No! I'll delete it. Delete it. Don't delete it. Come on. Ginny... Ginny! Delete it. No. - Hi, love. - Hi love! What are you doing? I'm just checking my investments. Looks like I have enough for the business. So, did Ginny accept it? Really? I was hoping she wouldn't. Pats. Love... If you're not comfortable, just tell me. I'll take back the project. Nothing. Are you jealous? A bit. Well, she is your ex. But that's it, right? Of course, love. I wish you were here. I wish your contract there were done. Love, two more months, okay? Why? Why are you starting at me like that? Love, I have to go. My break time is over. You know, Mr. Villanueva... if you don't stop this... later... we'll surely have a sex video. - I was kidding. - Game. So, our homecoming is this October. Ginny, I'll stay at your place, okay? Let's focus on me, first. Okay? Babe, hurry up! We're running late. Okay, read. What the hell... Beb... Baba... How old am I now? Did he come back? Check. Beb, I just need to know. What? Why he came back. That's just pride, Beb. I don't want to end up like my parents who missed their chance because of their pride. Hurry up! There's heavy traffic on the expressway. I'm coming. What a huge house! - Good morning. - Good morning. Let's go. - Come inside. - Thank you. Oh, you're here. - Hi. - I hope you didn't get lost coming here. - Good morning. - How are you? I'm okay. - This way. - Okay. Let's go. You have a big house, Chef. - Come. Let's taste this. - Okay... There. How does it taste? What does it taste like? Weird... Tastes like sour pork stew, but... why is there no soup? What? Your family cooks sour pork stew so well. Why did you change it? Because the concept of this restaurant is Filipino with a twist. So, I want the restaurant's design to match the concept of our food. But Ginny's specialization is restoration. Right, Ginny? Really? So, we're not talking about any project here, right... I can also do that. That the changes would be this drastic. What did your grandma say? Is this okay with her? She's no longer here to tell me if I'm right or wrong. She passed away? - Love! Hey. - Hi. The team who'll be doing our restaurant is here. Love, I want you to meet Beb, We'll go ahead. What's wrong? She looks like Mama Mary. What? Mama Mary? She has a deep-seated issue with Mama Mary. Why does she have to look like Mama Mary? - Why Lord? - Shh, it's okay. Is there a problem? - I'm just looking for my contact lens. - She's looking for Mama Mary. What Mama Mary are you talking about? My contact lens is missing. - It fell somewhere around here. - Yes! Contact lens! Where could it be? You left the blueprint. - Oh! Thank you. - Okay. Let's go. We'll just buy a new lens. You're going to work with your ex. And with your ex's present girlfriend. Beb, everything is clear to me now, as clear as Mama Mary's apparition, that it's over between me and Marco Villanueva. - So it's settled... - But, we're professionals here. I can be professional. But... Baba said our company needs this project, right? Oh yes, but... He's about to come down, ma'am. Really? - Herman. - Ma'am? Is this beam a new addition? - Yes? - Isn't it there in the plan? No. Can you check if this can cover the whole area until outside? Okay, later. No. Now. Do it now. Check it now. - What about this? - I'll take care of that. Give that to me. - Now? - Yes, now. Look for Sir Jojo. Ask for his help. Quick! Check the measurement outside. - Sure. - Okay. Okay. Oh... Sorry. - I'm measuring something. - Are you okay? - Yes. Thank you. - Okay. Closer, Baby. It just needs one touch. Then it'll come out of the TV. Oh, Ali... We already studied the plan that you sent. But Marco didn't approve it. He said it no longer looked like a Filipino restaurant. Is he there? Can I talk to him? No. It's our service time. Chef, it might get too salty again. Customers were complaining the pork blood stew was salty. What? Marco's pork blood stew was salty? - Is he sick? - No. No. Um... Peewee is the one who's salty. Okay, okay. Look, Ginny. If this is becoming difficult... No. It's okay. Um, here's what I'll do. I'll revise the layout. Stop pestering Marco. No. I really saw it. So what, Marco? Should Ginny keep her hopes up? No, she shouldn't. Wanna bet? Me? I'll bet on Marco and Ginny. There. What? Okay! Go. - To our bet. - Cheers. We're here in your house. Too bad I didn't catch you. I wanted to personally hand you the revised plan. It's so hard to catch up with you lately. No, Ginny. I left the house early. I didn't know you were coming. I'm running late for a meeting. I can give it to you there. No hassle at all. I wanted to give it to you personally so I can get the feedback right away. Okay. See you. Oh. Ginny. You can just leave the plan with the housekeepers, right? This is going to be quick, I promise. - Hello, Ginny. - Sorry! Sorry! Traffic is so bad. Yeah. I couldn't wait for you. I had to pick up something at Roxas Boulevard. You know what? - Just leave it at the restaurant. - No! It's okay. Roxas Boulevard is just nearby. I can give it you there, see you. Don't you think he hired you just so he could get back at you? Whatever. You guys take care of Mr. Aguinaldo. - I'll just take a cab. - Ginny. Wait! Hey. Wait! That's mine! That's... That's mine. Wait. Hey. Wait! I was here first. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry. Hey, don't ignore me. - Come on! Let's go. - Hey! Open this. Hey! I was here first. Hey! That's rude. How crass. Such an asshole. You have no respect. Okay, here it is. Hey! Miss. Wait. Sir! Open it. - Ouch. - I was here first. - Whatever. - You want a fight... I told you this is mine. I'm going to be late for school. There goes the taxi again... It's your fault. Don't touch me. - Hello? - Hello, Ginny? I'm really sorry. I'm on my way to Alabang. I have to catch a meeting there. What? Alabang? Okay. Fifteen minutes. Okay, bye. - You can't stop here, ma'am! - Stop! - Stop! Ouch. - What now? - Wait. - That girl is suicidal. Hey! Are you trying to kill yourself? Sir! What's the fastest way to Alabang? Don't call me "sir". Is that what happened? No. I told him... I'm here. Sorry, sorry... I'm here in Alabang. I'm here at the restaurant. Ali called me. We had to fix some problems with the catering. Is that so? Will that take long? Do you have any other errands to attend to? I don't know yet. I still have a meeting at Tagaytay later. Who are you meeting at Tagaytay? Hmm, Tagaytay... Marco. Ma'am Ginny wanted to give this to you. Give me the laundry. I WASN'T ABLE TO CATCH YOU. - Is the chef there? - Good morning, ma'am. He's inside. Here he is. At last, I've managed to catch you. It's not yet six o'clock. I tried calling but you weren't picking up. I called your house. Your domestic staff said you'd left already. So, I thought I'd just go straight here. I haven't slept due to revising this. Show it to Ali first. Can you check it first? So we can save time. Besides, you have the final say, right? Just email me and save yourself the hassle of coming here. It's okay. We haven't seen each other for so long. It's time we caught up with each other. You've changed so much. Just asking. Again, just asking. So that's why you've been avoiding me? It's too early for you to be here. Is it because you couldn't sleep either? Look at that. That isn't your job, but you're doing it. And you tell me you're not affected? Why did you get me as your architect? There are other architects out there. I'm a businessman. Why didn't you follow me to Barcelona? Are you serious? That's what you asked for, right? If you'd really loved me, you should have followed me. If you'd really loved me, you shouldn't have left me. So I'm asking you... I received that on my birthday. I can't remember. I hope that's enough for you to know that I'm the one you love. I hope you have done everything you wanted. Is that still right, Marco? Is that still true? Is that why you got me as your architect? What happened? We're locked in! Guard. - We're locked in? - We're locked in. Guard. So what now? Guard! We're locked in. I can't die yet. I can't die. - I still want to do a lot of things. - Guard. Open this! We're locked in. We're going to die here. Open this door! Open! - It's so cold... - Guard. - So cold... - Sir. Sir? You're locked in? - Yes! Get the key. - Where is it? I don't know! Do something. Get anything! Break down this door. Okay, just stay there. Ginny? Hang on. Hang on. Marco... if we die now... can you answer my question, please? Does the email still hold true? Do you believe that our love story deserves a better ending? Marco. Ginny. Hang on! We'll get you out of there. And as what Marco's grandma used to say... Wait. What's this? I thought you understood that I wanted it modern? Don't force restoration just because it's your specialization. Oh no, Marco. No, it's not because of that. Besides, old houses being turned into restaurants is the trend right now. The last one was in San Juan, right? The one owned by Chef Laudico. If you still don't like the idea after this presentation, you can replace us. I've already presented a lot of ideas but you haven't chosen anything. And so I wondered... if maybe you'd already chosen one. But you just don't want to admit it, because you don't want to look back. Remember this? It all started here, right? We threw around a lot of ideas for months. Countless nights were spent on the plan. Because you said... My wife is really talented. Don't you want to be Mrs. Villanueva? So, for every mouthful, remember, that my heart beats only for you. - And love... - I love you, Ginny. Come on. - Marco! - Go, Ginny. Ginny? Ginny! Ginny. Ginny, wait. How did it come to this? You made me look like a fool. If you want, I'll go with you to Barcelona. But you said don't like it there. I'm okay. I'm okay to go with you. I don't think that's possible. Mama got mad already. Don't make me run around in circles, Wella. Have pity on me. Tell me, is Ginny leaving today for Barcelona? I really don't know, Marco. I came from Batangas. Her father is not there. They said he went to Manila, to bring Ginny to the airport. - Is that true? - Her father is not here. I don't know, Marco. Sorry. Damn it. Don't lie to me. Wait. Stop it. Open the door. Ginny. Ginny, open the door! Don't leave me. - Marco, stop it... Please. - Ginny! Let's talk! Open the door. Ginny. Ginny, open the door. Wait, Ginny. Ginny. Ginny, open the door. Ginny, talk to me, babe. Uncle Ben, please... Uncle Ben, open the door. Babe... Babe, don't do this to me... Babe, have pity on me. - Don't do it. - Let's go, sir. Ginny. - Straight to the airport. Come on. - Babe. - Sure. - Hey. Ginny, wait. Babe. Don't leave me, Ginny. Ginny. Damn it, Ginny. Ginny. Ginny. Ginny. Wait. You really didn't like the design? - You're the one who said that if I don't... - You really didn't like it? In what way do you want me to tell you so you'll get it? In a way that is true. I didn't like it. Okay? I don't believe you. You can leave. There's nothing else to talk about. Beb was right. You have no plans of pushing through with this project. You just accepted this to get back at me. What made you think of that? Either that or you really liked it, - but you just can't accept I'm part of it. - You haven't changed at all. Or maybe you just don't want to admit I'm still the one you want... So why? Tell me why you didn't like it! What? What did you say? Why? Because I worked on it. I worked hard for it. That's why you need to know what's wrong? Yes! Because if there's a problem, then I'll fix it. Because it's not just your time and effort that you invested, right? But your heart and soul. Right? Because you did it... for that person whom you thought still trusted you and believed in you. Right? If you made mistakes... you thought she'd give you a chance to correct them. Because she made you believe she loved you. That you were important to her. That you shared the same dream. That you shared the same vision of the future, right? You need to know... why one day when you woke up, everything suddenly changed. Why is she gone? Why are you alone? You need a reason, right? You need something to hold onto. Or make you understand why you were made to look like a fool. Why you looked like shit to everyone. Even yourself. Because you don't know how. You don't know when. You don't know what happened. What's wrong with you? Why did she leave you? Marco... How dare you ask for something you refused to give? Marco... Marco... So why? Why didn't you tell me the truth? I was afraid. With that courage of yours? I didn't want to hurt you, Marco. A loser with small dreams. Marco... How could I tell you that? That my respect for you was slowly fading? That I didn't look up to you anymore? That I was afraid we'd end up like my parents. Even if it hurt, you should've told me. You know what died in me, Ginny? I can't trust you anymore. Marco... Marco wait... I will tell you again and again that I'm immature. Please forgive me, Marco. I'm sorry. But we met again, Marco. If you hadn't received that email, if Ali hadn't called you, we wouldn't have. But we met again. And I've been asking, what for? Or why? There's a reason, right, Marco? - Please leave. - Please... No! - I've moved on with my life, Ginny. - No... - Come on, please... - No, Marco... Marco, please... Is this what you want? You should've finished your last year. What a waste. It's different when you have a diploma. It means you're not just a cook. You're a chef. I just want to put up a restaurant. Uncle Ben, I don't need a diploma for that, right? Right. Just pay me your tuition. It's cheaper that way. Come on, babe. I don't want to say no to Mama's offer to pay for my master's degree in Spain. Tempting, right? She said she's going to find you a job there. You can apply at restaurants. There are a lot of Filipinos there. At least we're together. What about our restaurant? I priced it at 60 pesos. But they want a lot of dishes. Babe. We're making a loss again. So, what's your plan now? I still don't know. Well, maybe I'll try again. If you want, I'll go with you to Barcelona. I thought you didn't like it there? I asked you before, but you said you don't like it there. I'm okay. I'm okay to go with you. I don't think that's possible. Mama got mad already. Hello, Ma. We're on our way to the airport. You'll be late for your flight. You better leave now, the rain is pouring. Wait! Stop this. Stop. Who's that? Marco again? - Marco, stop it. - You go now! Get away. Stop it! Please set me free. Ginny! Don't mind him. He's not good for you. Didn't I tell you? He's going to end up like your father. - Be brave. - I can't do this anymore... You have to leave. - This is where your future is. - I can't do it, Ma. - You have to leave now. - I can't do it, Ma. You'll end up nowhere with that man. Ginny! Ginny! No, I was just busy. We have a lot of clients who want catering. Yeah, Ali mentioned that. And I saw Ginny's proposed design. You're right, Marco. She's good. Actually, even Migo and Peewee really liked the plan. Did you like it? So you mean this is really how you want it? Yes, because she preserved the beauty of your ancestral home, and I'm sure your grandma would have found it beautiful. Wake up. No... Stop it. You've been like this for four days! You stink. Harsh, Beb. Can't you see she's broken-hearted? You're not helping. I just got here yesterday. So that's why you guys got drunk? Ginny, you have to eat. Come on. You have to eat so you can work. Yes, Ginny. I don't know what to tell our clients anymore. Our projects are so delayed. Let's forget about Marco. They're making us go in circles. Something happened between them. What happened? - What happened? - Something happened? It's... It's Marco. What? Who? Give that to me. Patty? It's approved? You're my friend. Beb, please try to understand... You're the one who can't understand. You're the reason why Patty exists. Because when you left Marco, you gave him the right to love someone else. If you won't shape up, then let's just close this company. My tummy is aching. I studied the plan very closely. And Ginny, it's good. The plan is good, but it seems like you forgot something. Where am I in the plan? Love, it's not yet final. Ginny. What happened between us... It's nothing. Forget about it. Come on. Let's bring this inside. Snacks! From our boss. Come on, let's eat. - Let's have some snacks. - Come on. - Have some. - Here are some noodles. Good afternoon, ma'am. What are you doing here? I thought you were with your child? He's well now. He got discharged from the hospital. - He's recovering at home. - Really? That's good. Come, let's eat. - Let's eat. Let's all eat. - Sir! - Let's eat. - Thank you. What's that? - What surprise? - Wait... What happened? I'm sure I did everything that was needed. Why didn't it rise? - Baking powder, right, love? - Yes. I added baking powder. I followed all the measurements. And I was constantly checking it while I was baking. I almost used up all the toothpicks from checking it. Love, Love... Thank you. Come, let's share this. You want some snacks? Okay... Nothing beats your foolishness over Washington. I was so stupid, right? Now I have three children. Three times, I was stupid. I'm so tired of childbirth. Why is it like that, Wella? We're so stupid. - Right? - Yes. Every morning... Every morning... I slap myself again and again saying, "Ginny, you're educated. You even have a master's degree from Barcelona. Your parents didn't pay for your education so you could go gaga over a guy." I understand everything that Beb says. I know what's right. But why is it like that? When I'm faced with him... I can't do it. You know why? Because you're still hoping. That hope is a poison. It's like drugs. It's addictive. Without hope. It's so painful... So painful... Hey, be strong. Accept it until it heals and disappears. He was so mad. - Maybe he just doesn't like... - What's happening? Ma'am, Chef Peewee and his two assistants got sick. Manang is on leave because her son just arrived from Dubai. I don't know how to cook so I've been messing it up. Oh, sorry. Jessie, Chef is calling you from the kitchen. - Not in the mood? - You bet. He and Patty fought. Where's the pork belly? It's almost four and we aren't even halfway through. We still have to do catering later. Here you go. What are you doing here? Let's talk about that later. But now, I'll be your assistant. - But... - Stop acting up. - Jessie, give that to me. - Okay. Go. - Thanks again. - Don't mention it. So, can you look at this now? There's no need for that anymore. Why? So what will happen to this and your new building? I didn't agree. Sorry. I'm hungry. Is it good? Tastes like something I missed. Are you going to the homecoming later? Dean Dimalanata is waiting for me. Let's go together. Okay. Okay then... - Hey, Beb, are you okay? - I'm hungry. - There's a lot of food here. - Yes. Ginny. I was just with Beb. Hi, Wella. - Beb... Chef. - I'm going to eat... Sir Marco is here. Marco! Ginny. Lala. - Marco. - What's up? Wella and I have been waiting for you. How are you guys? So the rumor isn't true that you guys broke up? - Did you end up together? - What? - Of course not! Wait. - No way. - Babe! Come here. - Quick! Dean, tell Ginny now. What? Your winning design. Do you still remember? Is this a joke, Dean? We're just waiting for you to agree. - Congratulations to you. - Thank you. Congratulations, dear. They just fought. They didn't break up. No, Wella. This is different. This is serious. Come on, you're addicted to hope again. Why don't you try facing reality instead? No, Wella. In reality, isn't Patty the only problem between me and Marco? Isn't she the one who started the problem? Can't you see, Wella? Even the universe is finding ways for me and Marco to have a second chance. This is it. I can feel it. You're riding with Beb, right? Yes... - Bye, Marco. - Bye, Wella. You have an early flight tomorrow. Have a safe flight. Don't forget your medicine. - You're sick? - No, no. Wella was just being her crazy self. Your dream is coming true. It's just going to take up most of my time. What? You won't accept it? You're now in the same league as the national artists. That's history. These things don't need too much thinking about. But you need someone who will help you in your new restaurant. I auditioned earlier, right? What if... What if I had said yes to you before? Maybe we'd be so happy right now. I'm sorry because I didn't tell you the truth. I'm sorry that I left you. I'm sorry that I hurt you. I'm sorry because I got scared. I'm sorry, too. Because I didn't see your fears. And your needs. I'm ready for that life you've always wanted? I'm ready, Marco. I'm ready for you. You know what the solution to your problem is? Making a decision. I know it's hard. Because if you compare them, one will always be better, and one will always be lacking. But if you're thinking of delaying your decision, you're making it even harder for yourself. Besides, it's unfair to the two women. I've already made a decision. I already know who I've chosen. Ginny was right. There was a reason why we had to meet again. Give my gifts to them. - Good morning, ma'am! - Really? Just kiss my godson for me. I'm here. Okay, bye. Ginny. We're going to eat. Want to join us? - No, I'm okay. I'm still full. - Sure? - I'll take care of this. - Okay. - Let's go. - I'm really growing old. I'm sorry, Patty. It's okay, Manang. Then the vendors and I had a chitchat... You're really one of a kind, Manang Suping. I'm going to leave now. Okay, don't forget my chorizo... Be safe, Manang. Have you eaten? I thought you were in Bacolod? I just got back this morning. You've seen Marco? Actually, I wanted to surprise him. Oh... Sorry... It's boiling. I'll just turn the heat down. You know, Ginny. I might get bored. The measurements there have to be exact, right? Baking is like that. If you still haven't achieved your desired taste. Because... So when you put it in the oven, that's it. How sure are you that your cake will convince Marco to move to New York? So it's not true? So why did you tell him that? So I could prepare this. Ginny? You said that in baking, you have to be committed... you have to be sure of your next step... How sure are you with Marco? If you're not really sure about each other. It's just logic. Shouldn't you let him go? Let him be with the woman he loves and wants. I own a big part of him that you will never ever get. So what, Patty? Are you just going to leave it like this? Is because they just choose to settle? Is that what you want? Don't tell me that you were never threatened by me, Patty. You were never jealous of me? What if you were just a rebound? But I still love him. And he still loves me. We both know he's not capable of hurting anyone intentionally. That he loves you more? Slowly... Passionately... A kiss that pierces through your soul... A kiss that tells you he likes it too. Your life must be so sad. I hope one day, you'll be able to find that kind of love. After this, you can go home. I'll just text you what we'll need. - Okay. - Ask the foreman to go back to the site. Okay. Love... Love, I'm sorry. Love, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, love. But don't play with my feelings. Be straight with me. Because I can accept whatever your choice will be. If you choose me, then it's me. If you choose her, then it's her. Uncle Ben. How are you? I'm okay. I'll be outside. How is she? Do you still remember this? That's where it all started, right? Are you going to reject me now? I've had enough rejections in my lifetime. You know... I loved you so much. So when you left me... it was so painful. It was so sad. I can still remember... I would force myself to sleep just so I wouldn't feel the pain. And every time I woke up, I didn't want to open my eyes, because I knew... it was going to be another day of unbearable pain. When... I wrote that email, I stopped myself from following you to Barcelona, because that's what you asked for. But I got tired. My heart got tired of waiting, of asking, of getting angry. So, when my grandmother died, I said... "Grandma, take this. Take all the pain and anger in my heart with you." You won't believe this, but the pain really went away. I became numb. And when I met Patty, that's how I picked myself up. So when... when Ali hired you, I said yes right away, because I was so sure that I could handle it. I was surprised when... I started feeling that I couldn't. It was like everything came back. The pain... The anger... And my love for you. The more I stopped myself, the more I avoided you, the more it grew. But Patty is already here. I hope... I want to tell you it will still be us, that nothing has changed. But we're no longer the same people, Ginny. Every time I think of you, I think of Patty. Every time I feel something for you, what I feel for her follows. It's so confusing. So if... I did something wrong, I'm sorry. So what's the clincher? Every time I imagine... that Patty will be gone from my life... I feel like I'm going to die a second time. That's how I know I really love her, and I can't imagine another day without her. So now... now I understand, why we had to meet again, why all of this had to happen. So we can be whole again. So we can give the people we love the love that they deserve. I hope she'll be able to forgive me. You, Marco? Have you forgiven me? Now, yes. How can I not forgive the person who pushed me... Thank you. Now it's your turn to help me. Tell me... Honestly, I don't. Because for me, That's probably the best gift Marco could have given you. An ending? A chance to start without any questions left in your heart and mind. Not everyone gets that. This one, you remember this? Your gift on my birthday? Don't be like me. I wasted that. Enough time for you to forgive yourself. And that's the best gift you can ever give yourself. - Yes! - You're a mommy now. - I know. - You're going to be a daddy. Hi baby! I'm your godmother. Hi baby! I love my baby. Okay! Cheers! - I'm going to be a godmother. - Ginny... - For you, babe. - Thank you. Finally! Beb! I'm on my way there. But wait... I got a flat tire. Wait, I'm just going to pull over. I'll take a cab. I'm going there. Taxi! Wait. You know... Wear a red lipstick. - So fab for you. - Huh? She's coming. She took a cab. Cab? Or a horse-drawn carriage? - Hi. - Thank God. That doesn't sound right, Dean. Sorry, it's a long story. I'm late. Kanor, you don't need... "Kanor"! This is what I love, to cook and to cook for my loved ones. That's all. To make people happy... I can't remove it. You all heard it's salty... Hide the salt! So, did Patty accept? Oh, I'm Patty. This is hard... It's hard to slurp, ma'am. Miss Ginny would like to give you... Ma'am. Miss Ginny would like to give you you... - Finally... - okay finally... Her turn... Don't you want to be Mrs. Vicine... What did you say? Mrs. Vicevi... Vesavis... He can't see anything already. What is it? Sorry... It's too hot! Super! Super hot! What is the reason? I hope it's not in the end. - So sad, sorry. - So sad. So you're not... Sorry... So it's not true. - It's good that it... - The gossip... Sorry. At first the two of you aren't... Sorry. This will be the last one. Sorry. Sorry, ma'am. It keeps on falling. - What am I going to do? - Cut. When you put it already... Sorry ma'am, Piolo fell. You're heavy.
