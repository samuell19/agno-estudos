RING OF DEATH Commissioner Belli, immigration office. - Hi, I'm Valenti. If you search for news for your paper, this is not your lucky day. Immigration office's boring, you know. - No, no news, I'd like to see you. I can't. - C'mon, it's important. Spit it out, Valenti, c'mon, what do you want? Hi. Listen, do you know Fontana, the lawyer? He has only clients hoarding money in Switzerland. Well, he needs a favour. - I don't want troubles anymore. Don't worry. He's looking for nothing special. I assure you it's a business as usual. That's easy money. So why not? It's nothing to sneeze at. Right, if it's easy, otherwise you'd better find another guy. Ok, let's see. I'll be quick to explain. It's about my son. Unfortunately he has lost his head for a fashion model,... ...an English girl, her name's Sandy Bronson. She takes a lot of money away from him, of course. And she's also very clever. Mino wants to marry her. He's a honest man, you must be proud of him for sure. I don't appreciate jokes so much. Let's cut it off, lawyer. You want me to take the residency... ...permit away from that girl and send her to London again. As you direct immigration office, it'll be easy for you. And then I'm ready to pay. There's also another thing, of little importance, yet. My son met a certain Romanis, who runs a record company called Embassy. He's offered Mino a job as a manager in exchange for a money contribution. He asked my wife for a loan. She's ready but I'm not convinced. Above all, it's about a lot of money. I'd like to know if Romanis is a swindler or can be trusted. Here's a million, for your first expenses. You'll let me know for the rest. It's my son. - A smart boy. I was thinking he was just like that. Looking for Sandy Bronson? I heard you've been ringing for a while. Look, she's not at home. - When will she be back? Don't worry, Sandy. It's nice here. I use to drink whisky. Well, would you like me to play a record perhaps? Or do you want me to prepare a dinner for you perhaps? Well, who are you? The soothsayer of the quarter. Can you see a crazy night of love inside your magic crystal ball maybe? No, only a trip. And you'll just leave, my dear. Mr Belli, from immigration office. We'll withdraw your residency permit. That's absurd, my permit is still valid for three months and... ...they never raised objections to renew it. Don't start to make a fuss. Be at my office tomorrow at 8 am. Nice piece of furniture. Where on earth did you ever find it? Listen, stop it! And explain what's going on. I don't feel like leaving at all. I've got a job I like here, my face's in many papers. That's nice at my age. No, I won't part with all this without a reason. Very right, but cops don't take care of feelings. Bad people, you know. - C'mon! Can you tell me what I did? Corruption of a minor, and it must have been not much effort for you. You just had to get it with Fontana's son, hadn't you? So this is due to Mino's father, of course. But you've made a blunder. I care nothing for Mino. He chases after me. Yes, I had sex with him and he got stuck with me, is it my fault maybe? Ok, I'll go to lawyer Fontana's and explain everything! Quick, you've only one day. - I'll talk to the press too! I'm ready to provoke a scandal! - Well said. To let off steam is always fine. Are you making it for love or in your interest? Don't make me leave. - So it's in your interest. I'm very disappointed. Hi, Baldo. - The porter has called us. And you? - It's a bad affair. You'll work overtime for Christmas. What must I write in my paper? Man or woman? - Move back, please! Listen, just this! - Please, be patient. I absolve you at the point of death,... ...in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Eternal rest, grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace. Amen. The medical examiner has arrived. I'd say his death occurred between 11:15 and 11:45 am, 2 hours ago circa. Just when I got off of my office. Fine, so you've one more person under suspicion. Bring me a sandwich. The corpse can be removed, if you want. Well, will you answer to me? What the hell were you doing here? Why did you pay a visit to Romanis? - Will you subject me to questioning? It's bureaucracy...ah, listen. How did the porter come in? He opened the door with his own key. He had brought in the mail. He had rung the bell first, but when he saw Romanis didn't open,... ...then he got worried. - Alright. Well? - Nothing, a buddy of mine had to finance him. Hence he wanted to know if he was a swindler or not. So I came here in order to feel him out and the door was open. That's very simple. - To finance him for what? Romanis run a record company. - I know that. Who's your buddy? One whom I know well. His name. - The lawyer Fontana. Fontana. Well, we'll question him too. Ah, well, gorgeous woman. What about the missing piece? It couldn't be found, the cut is old. - Ok. Put it together with the other stuff. - Didn't you hear any noise too? Anything suspicious? -...was wearing a strange and funny fur... ...I can't explain... - Who's he? The porter. - I was saying she came in just at that time,... ...it's a woman I've already seen several times, a friend of... ...someone living in this building, a beautiful woman. When did she get out? - I don't know, I was elsewhere,... ...I don't stay in the lodge all the time. How was that fur? - A white wolly fur. Like a sheep, I'd say. - Therefore a sheep fur. Why not? If it's ok for you... How can you find a girl if you know only her fur? Then maybe she was only paying a visit to her lover. Move that table, I've already checked... I'll get the fringerprints... - Belli. Where can I find Fontana now? I've only his studio number here. What do I know? I also use to call him at his studio. Hello, I want to talk to the lawyer. Well, it doesn't matter to disturb him! It's me, Belli. Just to talk to you! I insist, I must see you within a hour! Very well, at your house. See you later. Well done, Sandy, don't move! Don't support your breast, keep it soft! Done. Change your wig, you have five minutes. No, stop it now, I'm working. Me too. Romanis has sent me here. Who the hell are you talking about? Who does know him? Well, can you tell me what I did? Target practice towards Romanis! I told you I don't know this Romanis! They saw you getting out of his flat and a while ago I came in... ...there too and I nearly had a fit! Give me your bag! - Why? I'd slap in your face... What's the key of your house? - What do you care? With which key have you opened the door?!? What's the key of the front gate? These are the keys of the elevator, of the the mail box,... What are these other keys?!? - I don't know! They are my keys! You were Romanis' lover, these are the keys of his apartment! No! I've changed the lock, they are the old keys. These are Romanis' keys, you were his lover! You went to bed with Mino and with him! There's a lot of people who saw you getting in and out of there! Answer! Is that what happened or not?!? C'mon! Come here and answer! Is that what happened? Answer, I told you! Is that what happened or not?!? - I didn't kill him, he was... ...already dead when I came in! It wasn't me, I swear! He was in his bedroom... - Go ahead. ...lying dead on the floor... there was a lot of blood... ...I cried out, then I ran away. Why didn't you call people, neighbourhood, porter or police? Why didn't you do that? - I don't know... I wanted to talk about that with Mino first. Why? Because once Mino caught me in bed with him,... ...they had a fight and beat each other. So I was afraid that... - That Mino had killed him? Yes. And that's what happened?!? - No! Mino didn't kill him! Mino has nothing to do with this matter. And me neither. You must believe me. Maybe it was you or not, we'll see. Will they question me? - Surely. You'll be one of the first to be caught, tonight... ...or tomorrow in the morning, at the latest. Papers will certainly go wild for that... ...the poor Baldo will need a good culprit to put in jail. You mean me? - A woman works fine all the times. Luckily you're just in troubles. - Why have you said "luckily"? Who knows you had got Romanis' keys? Nobody. And that they beat each other? Nobody. The porter saw you getting in but doesn't know when you got out. You could say that you rang the bell and,... ...since Romanis didn't answer, you went away. Only I could refute you. But I won't. In exchange you won't tell police I had ordered you to leave Italy. You never saw me, got it? Fine. As to your departure, we'll talk about it again in the next days. You'll get some money for that, won't you? I had guessed it right. I'll make up my wages. A bullet shot into his head from two meters. I don't understand...I assure I didn't know that. Did you know Sandy Bronson was Romanis' lover? No, I didn't. It's strange that Romanis and Sandy, my two assignments,... ...had a love affair. Am I disturbing you? - Excuse me, what were you saying? No doubt that the police will wonder if Mino was aware... ...of Sandy's double affair. Jealousy might be also a good motive for a murder. In fact they already beat each other once. In the end he also could be the killer. Mino? That's absurd! I don't want my son to be involved in this matter. Leave him out and I'll be grateful to you. Not only in words. That isn't simple. Does the police know about the brawling? No. Not yet. Who has knowledge of it? Romanis, Sandy and me, of course. Let's take Romanis away, he won't speak certainly. We're only left with me and Sandy. Can I be sure the both of you will keep silent? The girl will. There will be no profit for her, poor thing. Your money is still at stake, doesn't it? And you? Well, I'm a police officer. It's not a matter of money. As long as Mino didn't do that, otherwise I won't conceal a killer. I'm a criminal defence lawyer. In conscience I can tell you... ...that I deeply hate murders! If my son were a killer,... ...I'd be the first to report him. I know words count for nothing, but they are just what I think. Excuse me. Now I want to introduce my wife to you. They will question her too about the money she had to loan to Romanis. Darling, will you come here please? Hello. - Hi, Vera. This is a friend of mine, I don't think you know him. Stefano Belli. Are you a lawyer? - No, a police officer. I'd like to see you, mrs Fontana, alone, if you don't mind. It's about Mino. Look, that guy looks like an idiot. Wake up! - Agreed. Gastone, anyone has called me? - No. Buy me a pack of HB cigarettes please. - Yes, right away. Do you have a light? Bye. - You're Mino, aren't you? Yes. It took me some time to find you. I have to talk to you. For business. - What kind of business? Who are you? Will we get out of here? So what? Have you finally made up your mind? Did you kill Romanis? - What the hell are you saying?!? Cut it off! I know everything! It was you! - No! Ask Sandy for that, maybe she killed him. She called me. C'mon, say you killed him! Speak! - No, it wasn't me, I swear! What do you know about Romanis? Spit everything out! What do I know? He was one like any other. But you had to work with him, you had a connection! He couldn't care less about me! He used me just to get money out of my parents! There's a pharmacy in the nearby. By the way, police. What's happened to Mino? I'm sorry to bother you. Why don't you answer me? Will we go for a drive by your car? Why via Veneto? There's a lot of people. Listen, this thing doesn't please me. What's happened to Mino? - I wanted you to talk about him. Let's have a little talk. Relax, madam. With a police officer? - Don't offend me please,... ...it's a job like any other. Why did you want to loan that money to Romanis? And how much exactly? - What do you know? Your husband told me. - I find it rather strange. Why? I don't think you're friends at all. What does my husband want from you? A few minutes ago I beat Mino and... ...I'm just afraid I gave him a nasty beating. You must be crazy! Please, tell me, what you did to him? Where's Mino now? He must have got well again now. Well, how much money did you want to loan to Romanis? A lot. He died. Don't you know? What? - Didn't your husband tell you? Knocked off by two shots. Well, you see, Romanis used to live here. Via Veneto, in broad daylight, a lot of people's all around,... ...the killer comes, gets in and shoots, then gets out and disappears. A lot of cool blood is needed. Actually Mino isn't but it's like he were my son. He's my sister's son and was just born when she died. She was my husband's first wife. Mino's their son. I decided to be his mother, that's why I love him twice. Leave him out of troubles. Excuse me, do you have a light please? Rossi, call a car. You, go home, clear off! Here's my statement, do you want to hear it? Later. Three copies, to be recorded. Ok. I've questioned a lot of people and nobody spilt the beans,... ...her included. Have you seen her, haven't you? What's her name? Sandy Bronson. Come to my office. Excuse me, commissioner. - Yes, you may come. Come. What does she have to do with it? What did she tell you? She was Romanis' lover. - You've been attacked tonight. Any connection with Romanis' case? I didn't ask you, as he wanted to talk to you. Well, no...no connection, they had pestered a woman and I... But you prevented the policeman from catching them! For the good of his. He was firing just for a couple of slaps. He's a family man. - When did you see the victim for the first time? When he was dead. - And never before? When were you before being assigned to Rome? In Sardinia? - Don't you dare! Where are you going? - Home. If you conduct the investigation,... ...I'll go to bed, I've just spent a sleepless night. All I'll do is only to fill some gaps, like in your friend's deposition. As for the rest, it's on your own responsibility. My friend is a colleaugue of mine, most of all. And I had already questioned him on site. - But... Moreover I add that I verified his statements... ...and these have proved to be right! Fontana has confirmed everything, each and every point! So I consider your questions out of line. What does this mean in your opinion? - What do I know? All the leads are alike. Pick up a copy. Police? - You're Emmanuelle, aren't you? It's about Romanis' case. Come with me, I've to ask you some questions. But I'm busy. - I'm sorry. Is it important? Just a moment. Please, in case they search for me, tell them I'll come back soon. Yes, ok. - Police. Excuse us, but we'll ask you some questions. It's about Romanis' case. Why did a star like you want to sing for a shitty record company... ...like the Romanis' one? Baldo's asked you the same, hasn't he? Please, speak slowly. Do you like my house? I've been living here only for two months and I find it funny. My mother and my brothers live downstairs. But they never come upstairs, as they bore me. I've asked you a question. - Well, can you tell who you're? What the hell do you want? Look that I'll tell the waiter to... ...throw you out! - I told you, I'm police. Police...but those other cops say you aren't, then why did... ...you disappear when they arrived? ...another squad. Answer! Why did you want to sing for Romanis? What a bore! I've just finished to explain that to the others. What's true is that we have only discussed about it but that's all. I use to receive job offers every day. But you've been talking with Romanis about it for long. I've considered the thing just as I'm a Tommaso Fontana's friend. Mino. - What kind of friend? Once I went to bed with him in the afternoon. It's strange to do it during the afternoon, don't you agree? So he's your lover, isn't he? From which world do you come from? I'm still young. I've got only friends for now. Yes, Mino's a bit dumb and hence... ...I feel much tenderness for him. So you made a deal with Romanis feeling much tenderness for Mino. Not bad, though. So what? What did Baldo think about this little fairy tale? He said that it's so stupid that it could be even true. You old men always don't realize a damn thing! You've covered yourself by perfume. But I've smelled alcohol right away. And your pupils look like two windows. Where's the syringe? I use to make such a mess, now you're starting too. Now I know something Baldo's unaware of. If they question you about Romanis, you fall into crisis and must... ...have an injection. Why? I'm asking you a question. You're an asshole, let me go! Well, see you. Bye. Yes, I'll be back. Bye. Yes, bye. Look! - What a car! - You've got lots of money. - Amazing! Listen to the following. Romanis wants to take you away. Someone's jealous and so bang! Ah, no, this doesn't work. You're a serious thing. You're involved into a circle of serious business. Only Romanis is a bluff. But you're taking drugs. You're not clever. Listen to me now. I earn 20 million Lire per month and I've just started now. How much do you earn? You're not so clever. Do you know that if I report you for drug use, you'll be in jail... ...for two years at least? Add all the missing income while you're in jail. Make your own calculations. Money's cool, why must it be all for you? What do you mean with these words? That you're right and that I must wisen up. So you'll shell out a check of 15 million Lire to me. Pay, beware, this is not a joke. Clear off! Who does provide you with drug? The name. It's pointless, he's dead in any case. Glu, glu, glu...into the river Aniene, along with his car. Dr Landi. Mino introduced me to him. But I'll leave heroin, will be treated for drug addiction now... ...and then will be back to marijuana. Hello, Sandy? How came that Romanis requested money? By accident. He met my wife and got the idea to make such proposal to her. Immediately that sounded good to my wife and she told me about it. Have you come to know anything? You keep me waiting. Does this ring a bell? No, nothing, only... ...that it might be attached to that leaf. But it might be also a sign by a print. But did the sender agree with Romanis or were against him? Who's the woman? What did they want from him? Do you really know anything about it? No, I'd have told you right away. Oh, please take me to your bed. I'm too sad today, just like when I was In England. What did you do when you were in England? Oh, nothing special. My mother is a teacher. In a school of a small provincial town. Maybe you're just a little girl who likes money a lot. I don't know. I've been starting to earn only for a short time. But you've made a good choice of the beds where you slipped into. You want to marry Mino who has a very rich father, then... ...stay with Romanis, who's not lacking of money, even if... ...it comes from someone else. Wait. If I had wanted to be a whore, I'd be filthy rich now! Right. So, tell me about the pic, what does it mean? I told you I didn't tamper with Romanis' business! If he stayed with me, it was for other reasons. Cut it off! You knew him well! Tickle makes men talk at bed! What was he telling to you? What's that pic? - I don't know! I know nothing about it! Ok. I beg your pardon for the bed but these are messy days. I've always a lot of things to do! No, wait. I know Claudio's desperately seeking a negative. But I can't tell if this has a connection with that pic. Who's this Claudio? A Mino's friend, a photographer. He often worked for Romanis, as he's good. Yesterday, late in the night, he turned up at my house in a fury. He even beat me, once again for the same story. I was Romanis' lover, hence I must know something. He wanted a certain negative but I didn't even know what... ...he was talking about, as well as I don't know what you're talking about. Why didn't you tell me that right away? Because...he threatened to kill me if I told that to somebody. All of you are getting upset with me. Not bad. Well, you said you're a Mino's friend. What do you want? - I'm a Sandy's friend too. I inform you that I don't give discounts. I solely and exclusively work for quality. And I'm also a Romanis' friend. Poor devil. I'm developing some pics but you may go ahead. Sandy told me you're looking for a thing. I've got the negative. - Excuse me, but I just don't get you. I've been not seeing Sandy for many days. You don't trust me, do you? That's right. I'll explain: Sandy states that you could use that negative... ...much better than us. Why don't we become partners? 40 for me, 40 for you and 20 for Sandy, ok? Well, show me or we'll keep on playing with riddles. I just don't bring the negative with me. A copy is the same. I still don't get it. Hey, wait. At least tell me what the hell you're talking about. I see that you're interested in the thing. Hence this is just the negative you were looking for. I didn't tell anything about a negative at all. And above all this looks like a bit dirty story. I've no intention to be involved into that. Clear off! Have you known Mino since a long time? Since the times of high school and university. Architecture? - Yes. I'd have sworn on it, looking at the style of your pics... Do you often pay a visit to Mino's? Do you know his parents? Can you tell me what you care? And what the hell are you searching in my studio? Nothing, but if you meet Mino, I'd like to leave a note for him. Where do you keep the paper? - In there. There's a whole block of paper. Not this but the headed one. Police. I've finished it. Hey! Stop it! Cut it off! Are you gone mad? You just can't do like that, you know! That pic came from here. You took it. It's not actually a professional work but it must have been thrill... ...or haste, right? You undress a woman, take her to bed, then... ...can't resist the temptation of work, can you? Who's that woman? Had Romanis' got the idea of using that pic or you? Who's that woman? C'mon, answer! I'll call the police. - I'm the police! No, if the police beats you, they do that in the central station. Beware that before you dial the number, I'll batter you! Now I'll tell this guy to call the police. How far you're going. You'd better have told before that my visit was bothering you. I'm calling because it's been a long time since we had a little talk. It's just to kill time. Interest might be a motive, for example unpaid debts. Or Romanis cheats somebody... who finds out and... Or a blackmailing. Why are you talking just to me? Who else then? Do you like it warm? It's my birthday. Be careful, don't get yourself dirty. I think it's blackmailing. No music. I met Claudio, by the way. Who's Claudio? The photographer. Your sons's friend. A great guy. Women must pull their hair out to go to bed with him. Maybe. Why do you think it's blackmailing? To go to bed with you,... ...I bet one must start with your hair. You're trembling. Don't drink champagne anymore,... ...it's bad for you. The killer comes to via Veneto at 11 am on Thursday. Follow me as it's interesting. It's a woman, there's no porter, nobody sees her getting in. Romanis is euphoric. He's expecting some money. And he thinks that woman has brought it. Instead she starts to beg and pleads him to let her go. She's afraid, desperate and loses her head. So she fires and hits a glass and a blackmailer. Who? Let's suppose she has a son who often invites his friends at home. One of them is much more interesting than the others. The woman's marriage doesn't work. Or she wants to indulge her whim for once, I don't know. The fact is that she goes to bed with him. He's a photographer and captures his conquest. Then he boasts about that all around and shows the pic. To Romanis too. Romanis is quick to use his brain. So the blackmailing starts. That's the way things turned out. Will we give a name to that woman now? You give a name to her. I can't help you. Yes, I see. What a pity. Well, many thanks for the show and no hard feelings. I've no intention to excuse you. - Never mind. I'm worried about other things. How came you were so upset? Yes, that's true, I cheat my husband. We actually don't love each other. These things happen. Do you know how my sister died? After a surgery, she was forced... ...to take morphine. We didn't know that she got addict then. One day we found her dead. An excessive dose. Given the circumstances, I thought I had to become a mother for... ...Sophia's son and so I married her husband, even if I was much younger. You see, good feelings make the world unhappy. You've been really silly. How came you were involved in this story? Because I'm an idiot, I could even wait and read the killer's name... ...in the papers. - Why don't you do? It's very simple, for money. I've found a bottomless pit. I've a theory: the richer I'm, all the better I'll live. Also you give me money. Don't you know your husband gave me an unlimited credit, do you? He must have been well informed and have come to know that I'm... ...like a boxer who's soft in his head. Once I started, I can't stop. So I'm getting more and more stuck with the police, without... ...getting the sense of anything! Who could have done that? The unknown woman in the photo? Was it blackmailing? Was it Claudio to get back the negative? Or Sandy for the same reason? Or was it even Mino, at one with Sandy? I've only ventured a guess, don't take offence. I talk too much, right? Forget about everything. I hope I'll be more clever than a few cops devoted to their work. What's in it for your husband? Don't you know? You're not hopefully one of those women who cling, are you? If so, too bad for me. They're working too much at the police station. They come to pay you a visit and find me. They have been always finding me for a while now. Tell them I took a taxi because my car broke down. I came here to pay a visit to your husband. No, not so quick. Your living room is very comfortable and you're in the bathroom. Let them wait. They won't look for you in your bedroom for sure. I knew you were going to come to get it back. They wanted to talk to Mino. They came to know about... ...his brawling with Romanis. It looks like he boasted about... ...that with his friends. Luckily he wasn't at home. He's been missing since this morning. He'd better go to the police. But they will arrest him for the questioning. They will beat him perhaps. It's much better that he goes to the police. Stay, please. I need it now. Have they asked you about me? Yes, but it looks like they believed me. Yes, it looks like, well said. I've started to stink too much for them by now. Well, answer, why did you beat him? What did you want from him? I've never seen him before. Was it him or not? - He doesn't even resemble him. Your memory is a bit weakling. - I'm a photographer! I can recognize faces. - He used to work for Romanis. Portraits of the little stars of Embassy label. We paid a visit to ask him some questions about the headless photo. His studio seemed to have been devastated by a tornado. What do I have to do with that? We've got a description of a guy like you. You're crazy. C'mon, Belli, you've got a copy of the photo and have thought like us... ...and you paid a visit to Romanis' photographer, as expected. Right. Did you come to know anything from him? If I had an idea, I'd tell you. Why should I do on my own?!? Let her in! Come in. It's him! He asked me where the photographer's studio was. The photographer's door is in the back of a courtyard. It's a strange door, it looks like a cellar's one. Nobody would say it's a photography studio's door. He asked me where the photographer was and so I showed him. Then he said: "Look, what the hell is this door?" So what? Which was the colour of my hat? - Green, I think, yes, green! I never wear hats! At a certain age, ladies should wear their glasses without shame. Maybe he didn't wear a hat but it was him for sure! No, it wasn't me! C'mon, take a closer look at me! Not from over there, come closer! Well, I'm not so sure anymore but it was one who looked like you. Listen. If I wanted that lineup, that was revealing only for me. I knew you would have duped the old lady. But my doubts are cleared out now. Think about it. Maybe you'll realize that you'd better tell me everything. If not,... ...I'll begin to stop you. Watch it! You soundrel! Are you crazy? Do you know Russian Roulette? The game with the revolver? What the hell that got to do with it? No, with the car. At the first time everything went well. Tell me all that you know about the photo,... ...otherwise I'll try it again! But I told you what I knew! Oh, c'mon, you want to save your skin too. Don't you know that a driver is the most likely to die? Stop! At the second time everything went well too. Let's go for the third one now! Please stop it, I know nothing! Let me get out, I beg you! Tomorrow morning I'll be in prison in any case. You may figure out who of us is risking the most. It's me the woman in the photo. Claudio had found a job for me. And I went to bed with him just to give thanks. And he took a pic of me. I don't know how Romanis got the negative. So he started to blackmail me. He was always threatening me to talk about it with Fontana,... ...preventing me from marrying Mino thus. What did Romanis care for it? Don't tell me he had fallen in love with you. No, he wanted me to approach wealthy and married men. And then he'd have got money out of them. Did you do that? In the end I told that to Mino. That's why they had a fight. And that morning we went and tried to convince him... ...to give us the negative back and found him dead. Yes, he was already dead, I swear. Did you mess up everything to look for the negative? Yes. - Did you find it? Yes, it was into his wallet. Why are you so eager to marry Mino? No, I don't want to marry him at all. I've already got a boyfriend in Brighton. I wanted Fontana to give me a lot of money. Much more than what he was ready to shell out. Why a lot of money? Because my boyfriend needs a lot of money. He plays guitar and doesn't care for anything. You won't be ever able to make money, you're not the kind. You don't have the needed determination. And for a boy, then. You're stupid. And by now it's clear that the photo has nothing to do with it. And the total darkness comes again. What's your advice? Must I resign? Give me that negative. - I burnt it. I took it out on it, so it's over. - Right. Contraceptives... - Are you interested in them maybe? No, I'm only interested in the name of... ...the doctor who made up this prescription for you. Landi. Romanis introduced me to him. The both of them came to a bad end. I even haven't had the chance to know dr Landi. I've been taking over his studio since a few days. If there were Franca, his nurse... but that's her day of leave. Don't you know where I can find her? I'll give you her phone number, if you want,... ...but until tonight... Injection? Franca? Yes. Thanks. Excuse me, everyone's congratulating me, the porter for first. I've graduated today. - All the best. Thanks. Come. How could he skid this way? No blowouts, no broken brakes... ...and he felt down into the river Aniene? Maybe he suddenly felt asleep. He had been continuously taking downers lately. Why? Perhaps a nervous breakdown for too much work. What kind of guy was he? - You mean dr Landi? He was a very good, capable and honest doctor. I know a woman who took drug thanks to him. Emanuelle, the singer. She must have needed it for sure. - No. Who does benefit from his death? Nobody, apart me. He had no wife or relatives. Why you? Because he had decided to fire me, he said I wouldn't... ...have got on here and he even insisted, we even had a fight. But no way, he was stiff and wanted to hire a male nurse in my place,... ...a certain Forti, who came from the same town as he did. Didn't he leave anything important amongst the papers in the studio? Some prescriptions and invoices, we brought everything back to his house. I've asked to talk to you but not here, I prefer my studio. PRESS CLIPPINGS The Fontana's case She dies for a fatal mistake alone in her villa Investigation about Fontana is closed The nurse clarifies his statement: it was mrs Sofia's car Morphine addict? The wife of a well known lawyer dies for a morphine overdose Excuse me but I didn't find my glasses. There's such a confusion at my house today. Sofia was my first wife. - You've not been widowed too long. No. Please, take a seat. I wanted to talk to you about Mino. I have to interrupt you. My money, lawyer. So far I've been following all your instructions. It's a correct request. I've already taken care of that. I've left blank the name so that you won't run risks. And now we'd better have a little talk. If the police arrests me, as it's very likely to happen, I'll tell... ...that I'm very suspicious about Mino and that if I've been telling... ...nothing so far it was just to wheedle your trust and know more. I had this move in store, I'm sorry but I'll use it. Beware, Belli. I can become a very dangerous enemy. Lawyer Fontana. Thanks. Mino's been hospitalized and is seriously ill. Where is he? - In the operating room. How is he? - They don't talk here. Sister, may I have a coffee? - No, sorry. So you've caught them. - They were 3, had a fight and beat each other. Two ribs broken and the fracture of cranium, right? - Yes. What do they have to do with this affair? Who are they? The photographer and two friends. I had just set him free. None of this is ringing a bell, is it? - No. Now it's late also for what I proposed to you. Tomorrow at 8 am I'll send a report to the chief of police. My husband doesn't want to see anybody. Tomorrow he will at your disposal. Now he wants to stay alone with his son. How is he? He's dead. Well, we can leave then. What the hell are you doing here? Are you here for the money? If so, you'd better not kid yourself. I decided to give you one million, you're not worth more. If then you think to go to the police and tell about the drug,... ...I inform you immediately that it's not worthwhile for you. I'll clearly tell them that you've tried to blackmail me and that,... ...rather, you've already got some money out of me. I've filled a check with your name and let it be cashed in. Hence, just to use your words, make your own calculations. See, we use to protect ourselves this way where I come from. And then I realized that drug addiction works in the end. Arrested singers always end up in selling more records. Come back tomorrow, now I've got something to do. Get out! See you at the studio tomorrow then... ...and don't forget to bring the record for the audition. Where will you go for New Year's Eve? I haven't decided yet. You're rude! What can you do? I'm a bit old-fashioned. Cover up, you'll be safer. Do you remember Mino? What kind of question is this? Sure I do. You must not drink but talk! No whisky and no marijuana! The sooner you'll collapse, the better it'll be for you! Why did you ask if I remember Mino? He's dead. - What? Do you know Claudio, don't you? About a hour ago. You're one of the first to know. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow I'm forced to make a record and... ...immediately after I've to leave for a tour. I won't be even able to go to his funeral. The mistake has been created by a mental bias. Romanis is a crook, hence he tells lies, all the times. Has he got a record company? So he says Emanuelle will sing for his label. Who can trust him? All tall stories, he's bluffing. To worm some money out, of the lawyer Fontana, for example. And Emanuelle confirms that. Her singing for Embassy?!? She has never thought about it! This is not the case, instead! Let's try to overturn everything a bit. Romanis doesn't tell lies, Emanuelle will really sing for him! Romanis got you in his pocket, you couldn't refuse to sing for him! Here's the reason why Embassy label was founded. I don't even know what you're talking about. Mino's death has opened my eyes. Why was he beaten to death? Sure in order to get something from him! I told and I tell you again I don't know what you're talking about! I'm talking about a naked woman lying on a bed. At the beginning I thought she was Sandy Bronson, instead it was you! You went to bed with Claudio and he took a pic of you! No, that's not true! That's true instead! As well as it's true you killed Romanis... ...to get the negative again! Don't tell bullshits. Do you really think I'm the kind of woman who goes... ...around and kills people? I wouldn't even have the time. I've got a copy of the photo. Now I'll bring it to the police... ...and they will take care of that. Have you made up your mind? - Yeah... ...that's true, it's me the woman in the photo, Claudio took it. He said that it's nice to see the way one is while making love. Then Romanis has organized it all and threatened to publish it... ...in an adult magazine, so I tried to gain time. I was wondering if that would have been publicity for me or not. Then Romanis was killed and I sighed with relief. The worse for him in any case, don't you think? Instead a woman has come out. She says she has got the negative. She called me twice yesterday and also some hours ago. She said that 30 millions would be enough for her. Maybe did you tell that you were ready to pay? No, for now I've told her to go to hell. Should she insist, then we will see. See? One must know how to take you. I didn't thought you were a killer at all, I just wanted you to... ...tell me you were the woman in the photo. You've cut your feet with those pieces of glass. Disinfect yourself. I'm not afraid, my doctors are very capable. That's me singing. Do you like, don't you? Why don't we go for a drive to the sea? Many thanks, my dear, but I'll go to the sea next summer. With some blonde girls, since I'll be very rich this summer. I'll have got 30 nice million in my pocket. Where do you find them? Listen, by any chance aren't you thinking of... Ah...as far I see, you've grasped the idea. I'll get that money, otherwise I'll send your photo to all the papers. We use to do it this way where I come from. Hello, Emanuelle. Hello, police. There's a dead woman in via San Salvatore, in Lauro no. 6. Hello? Belli. It's me, Fontana. I've thought it all out well. Mino's death forces me to make a decision. Tomorrow I'll tell the police everything. DR LANDI EUGENIO LANDI ID CARD From dr Landi's studio Franca Vanni Eugenio... With love... Dear Dr, we're sorry to inform you that mr Danilo Forti died... ...on 21 September of the current year because of a viral hepatitis. Valenti, it's Belli. Don't make a fuss, put on something and come down. I need you. I think they will fire me. The archivist has arrived in a hurry by a taxi. He was thinking the newsroom was going up in flames. Can you tell me what you're looking for? A name. She dies alone in her villa for a fatal mistake. Morphine addict? A lawyer's wife dies for an overdose of morphine. Her upset sister and husband,... ...rushed up from Rome immediately. A male nurse from... ...the near hospital would have noticed a car in the villa's garden. An interesting detail: a male nurse from the near hospital would... ...have noticed a car in the villa. That's strange since Sofia Fontana... ...must have been alone at home when she gave herself the... ...fatal injection. The male nurse, a certain Forti doesn't have... Forti... Investigation is over The nurse clarifies his statement: it was the unlucky Sofia's car Mrs Fontana's funeral will take place on Thursday ...on the other hand the nurse had no doubts about identifying... ...the car he noticed with mrs Fontana's one. The lawyer Fontana,... ...still upset after the fact, has refused to talk to our reporter. I'm only left with a thing in order to become sure. And you're the only one who can help me. Answer me frankly. Were you a Romanis' lover? No. Please... Before your sister's death, you had a medicine student as a boyfriend. It was Landi, wasn't him? - Poor Eugenio... I've never forgot him. - I had only this left to know. That he was your boyfriend. I know everything at this point. What? I'm sorry, Vera. - What are you sorry about? That photo made me waste my time. It had nothing to do with it. Just another story. I got it when I found Sandy dead. The killer didn't even look for the negative. Romanis was blackmailing two different persons for two... ...different stories. And Sandy was his tool in both the cases. The first one he blackmailed, the woman in the photo, is Emanuelle. The other one...the killer was... - Who? Your husband has been certainly very smart. He was able to get me with my back to the wall. He just need to speak and I'll go to jail. He's been running the show for all the time. Didn't you notice? What do you mean? I say that your husband is the killer. I've started to realize... ...that at Landi's, where I found some fresh ash near his papers. The killer went there and searched for something which I didn't know, though. I've come to know that later. It was the address of a male nurse who noticed a car at your villa... ...at Fiumicino when your sister died. Do you remember that? Yes. Why was the killer searching for the nurse's address? Because the killer must murder him. - Why? Because your sister didn't die by accident, your husband killed... ...her to be able to marry you. That was the key: a crime... ...occurred ten years ago. A perfect crime, except for one detail. A male nurse noticed a car in the villa, certainly the killer's car. In fact your sister was alone. The male nurse later recanted his statement. And the case was shelved. Fontana probably bribed him. Many years later Romanis arrives on the scene. By accident. And he's been told about some things by you. That your sister died under strange circumstances, for example. He's been told further more by Landi. The story doesn't seem that clear to him, yet. He reads the papers again. He notices that detail about the male nurse and is informed. So he reconstructs the crime as I did. And he starts to blackmail your husband, forcing Landi to assist. The two together have up Forti to Rome. The nurse Landi was hired to keep him on a short leash. Franca the nurse told me, she had been dismissed therefore. Forti was the weapon to convince Fontana to pay. But your husband is a criminal lawyer. He perfectly knows that it's no use to pay a blackmailer. So he kills,... ...first Landi,... ...then Romanis,... ...then Sandy. He goes to Landi's and searches for Forti's address, but doesn't find it. Forti's not in Rome. He's still in Fiumicino. The letter about him was in the mail box. Therefore the killer didn't find it. Forti's still in Fiumicino. Have you informed the police? - No. I don't want to see my husband again. If I rat, I'll go to jail. I've already told you he was smart. I haven't got any evidence. What about Forti? His life's in danger certainly. The killer just needs to come to know he's still in Fiumicino. But let it be clear that I don't want to go to jail. You're a coward! - I don't care! I've already been too much silly. Get out of my way. I'm sorry. Therefore your husband has dragged me into this story. He wanted to know if he has married a monster. You killed your sister because Fontana's rich, only for this. When Romanis and the others blackmailed you, you lost... ...your head and killed again. And now you've lost your head again. You've come here looking for Forti. You were afraid that he told me that what he noticed in the... ...villa was your car, not your husband's one. You didn't know Forti died by natural death. That's why he didn't come to Rome. I realized that since the first... ...time I saw you. You're impulsive. I was sure it was you but haven't got any proof. I knew that it was over for me. I had been knowing that since I met Romanis. Baldo? Were you sleeping? Well, at least I'm disturbing you. Draw up a report which says that Vera Fontana's the murderer. There's a hospital here at Fiumicino. Have an ambulance immediately sent to the seafront. Now you must be finally convinced that I’m clean. And these ones? If these are found with me... For fuck's sake!
