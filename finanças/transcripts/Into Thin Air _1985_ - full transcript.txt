What for? - Um, I'm going on a summer writing program there. - Oh. What kinda writing? - Uh, you know like uh, short stories and stuff basically. - Oh. Put me in one okay (laughs)? - Okay (laughs). - Have to be a really short story though. (fuel cap clattering) (latch slams) Well, nice knowin' ya. (engine starting) (bell dings) (engine revving) (upbeat music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Operator] This is the long distance operator. Will you except a collect call from Brian Walker? - Brian, yeah sure. Hey Brian. - [Brian] Rob? - [Rob] Hey man, where are ya? - [Brian] Uh, Nebraska. - [Rob] Nebraska, well what's it like? - [Brian] Yeah, miles of open prairie. Nothin' but prairie. It's beautiful. Um, look I'm having a little trouble with the van. Uh, it's the fuel pump maybe, I don't know. Anyway I'm waitin' for the tow truck right now. - Hey guess what? Shannon says he's gonna start me in the hundred. - [Brian] That's great. Uh, is mom home? - No not yet. Steven's out too. Just uh, me and the swim team. - Oh yeah? Mom's gonna love that one. Look um, I don't know how long I'm gonna be hold up here okay? So uh, tell her that I will call her tomorrow at her office. Alright? 11 o'clock sharp. Will you tell her? - Yeah sure, sure. - Okay I gotta go 'cause I don't wanna waste anymore time runnin' up the bill alright? - [Rob] Yeah and talkin' to me right? - You got it. Alright, take care alright? Buh bye. (phone clicks) - Hey mom. You just missed Brian. (door latching) - What? Did he get there already? - [Rob] No, he's in Nebraska. The van broke down. (swim team chattering) - What? What happened? - He doesn't know. He's waitin' for the tow truck. - A tow truck? - Yeah. He said he'd call you tomorrow at your office at 11. - [Joan] Where in Nebraska is he? - He didn't say. - Well didn't you ask? - No (laughs). Mom some of the guys are goin'. I gotta-- - Rob wait a minute. Didn't he leave a number? - No but he said it's not serious. (engine revving) (stone clattering) (tense music) (phone ringing) - [Woman] No that should be fine. (office members chattering) (Maggie sighs) - Give me a break. What must that man be thinking? I have my adolescent girls group, I've got the couples group and a full case load. When am I gonna have anytime for that? - [Joan] Did Brian call? - No. - I mean he's our director. He should be standing behind us not piling us up with more work. - [Joan] I can take one of your groups. - Well that's not the point Joan. You're just as overloaded as the rest of us. Somebody's got to be out here telling him what the hell is going on in the real world. - Well I'll speak to him. - No not you. You're not angry enough. He needs somebody to scream at him. - Well, I'm not sure that'll help right now. - So you'll talk to him? - Sure. And don't worry it'll work out. - Well give him hell. - [Joan] Jenna, are these all the messages? - Uh huh. - Were you here the whole time? - Yeah except for my coffee break. - [Joan] Who was answering the phone then? - Uh, that was Maria. - Maria? Did you take a message from my son? - He didn't call. Hm. - That's not like Brian. (typewriter keys clacking) No. No Larry he was supposed to call yesterday at 11 and he didn't. So we thought maybe he got in touch with you? - No he didn't. But I'm sure if anything had happened we'd have heard. Roads are jammed this time of year. It's practically impossible for an accident to go unnoticed. - Do you think we should call the police? - Uh, no. I don't think so. I think what probably happened is the trouble with the van slowed him up, he's making a run for college and he'll call us as soon as he gets there. When do classes start? - Tomorrow. - [Larry] Probably arrive sometime tonight. - Okay. Thanks Larry. (phone clicks) (birds chirping) (water dripping) (bird chirping) (pencil tapping) (bird chirping) (typewriter keys clacking) (bird chirping) (sighs) Why doesn't he call? (bird chirping) (phone ringing) (sighs) Hello. Oh hi Larry. No, we haven't heard. I see. Yeah I think you should. Okay well you let us know huh? (phone clicks) Your father's calling the Nebraska Police. (crickets chirping) (rock music playing) (kids chattering) - [Girl] Oh no, oh no! - Brian? (rock music playing) (kids chattering) - Buh bye! - Bye! (crickets chirping) - Mom? Mom what are you doing outside? Didn't you hear the phone? - No who was it? - Dad. He talked with the Colorado and Nebraska state patrols. They have nothing on Brian. - How could he just disappear? - I'm gonna call a couple of the campgrounds. Brian said he was almost there, so he must've been close to the Colorado state border when he called. I don't know, that's all I can come up with. - Well I'll stay up with you. - [Steven] No, no, no, no. We only have one phone line. Why don't you go to sleep? - Okay well you let me know if you find out anything huh? Come on Rob, let's go to bed. Come on. - Yes ma'am, I'm sorry it's early here too. The reason that I'm calling is we thought he might've spent the night at your campground. Would you check please? Yes, I'll wait. - Anything? - This is the last one near the Colorado border. Yes? I see. Okay thank you. (phone thuds) - Maybe we should call the hospitals. - No the Nebraska Police would've notified us if anything had happened. (chair creaking) (Steven sighs) - Honey why don't you get some sleep? (birds chirping) - I think we should go the police. (birds chirping) - Oh yeah, I can understand. I have a son and he travels. My God, some nights you don't sleep. But you know what? He always comes back. They always come back. How old did you say he is? - He's 19. - 19. He'll come back. - How do you know that? - Well it's uh, summer. He's a 19 year old kid. (phone ringing) He has a camper. He has what uh, $700 in travelers checks? - Well that's not Brian. He would never just take off like that. - Thing is you don't know with kids. You just don't know. - All we're asking is that you feed the information on Brian and the camper into the computer. - No you see, that's an international crime computer and there's been no crime. Besides he's only been unaccounted for for four days. So legally he's not missing. - Well he's not at school. He was supposed to arrive in time for classes yesterday and he didn't. - Right, and that's not missing. It's got to be 30 days. - 30? That's absurd. - It's not even our jurisdiction. It's got to be where he disappeared from. That's where you've got to check. Nebraska. - We did. We contacted the police there. They have nothing in their log. - Right? So no crime was committed. There's been no accident report. I don't know what else to tell ya short of going there yourself. (officers chattering) (airplane engine revving) (intercom dings) - [Flight Attendant] Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the no smoking sign in final preparation for our landing in Denver. Please extinguish all smoking material and bring your chair backs to their full upright position. (airport members chattering) - [Announcer] Flight 14 for Seattle is now in the final boarding stages at gate 5B. All passengers should now be on the plane. - Hi dad. - Hi. - [Announcer] Flight 14 for Seattle is now in the final boarding stages at gate 5B. All passengers should be on the plane. (tense music) (luggage thuds) - My God, where do we start? - I can't understand it. Except for its pickup the van was running perfectly. I mapped out Brian's route for him. I don't know what could gone wrong. - Steven listen to me. Steven? All day yesterday I made myself crazy thinking, if I'd only been with you boys this might not have happened. That's just not so. I woulda patted Brian on the back. I would've sent him off just as you did. - Dad he wanted me to go with him. I told him he'd be alright. - Steven it's not your fault. It's nobody's fault. We're gonna find Brian. - [Steven] He was traveling in a white VW van with Ontario license plates. - [Repair Shop Manager] No I don't think I've ever seen him. - [Steven] How 'bout the van? Have you see the van? It's a 76. - Not with Ontario plates. Not in the two years that I've been here. - [Steven] Well would you check your books please? - Look Mister I don't have to. - Well, look it would only take a minute okay? - It'll take me shorter than that 'cause he never stopped here. Sorry. (tool whirring) (phone ringing) - Sergeant Keyes? - [Sergeant Keyes] Oh I'm sorry Ms. Walker I'm late for an appointment. - [Joan] Oh I just wanted to talk to you for one minute. - I know what you'd like Ms. Walker. We've been over this. Before we put a runaway kid on the computer we have to-- - [Joan] Brian is not a runaway kid. - Well you filed statements with the police in Colorado and Nebraska. You contacted the school. - I know but maybe he has amnesia, and he doesn't know where he is. - [Sergeant Keyes] Amnesia? What makes you think that he has amnesia? - Well I don't but I'm just trying to think of something. I mean maybe he was kidnapped. - That's highly unlikely. Ransom calls usually come in the first 24 hours. - All I'm asking is that you put him on the computer. - I'm sorry Ms. Walker I'm late. - Sergeant? Sergeant Keyes? I bend rules everyday for kids that aren't my own. Now I want to find my son. - Okay. Okay, I'll, I'll do my best. And if I hear something I'll be in touch. (birds chirping) (engine revving) - It's getting late. Why don't we hit one more place and then stop for the night? - Oh my God. Dad! (tense music) - [Larry] What? What are you doing? Steven! - [Steven] It's Brian! - Brian? Where? - He's up ahead. - [Larry] Steven for... (horn honking) - Move out of the way! (horn honking) (tense music) Come on. - [Larry] Steven for God... - Dad, they're right there. There it is, see? (horn honking) - Steven, those are Ohio plates. Those are Ohio... (tense music) (horns honking) (Steven sighs) (traffic whirring) Why don't we leave here? Maybe the sergeant was right. Maybe we shoulda started out in Nebraska. Let's move over there. At least we know Brian was there. (gear shift shifting) (engine revving) Remember our trip to Cape Breton? God, how many years ago? Brian was, Brian couldn't have been more than eight. Morning we got there we walked out on the bluff, your mother, Brian, Rob. Looked out over the Atlantic. Brian was so sure he could see Iceland. (laughs) The Highlands. Nothing could convince him otherwise. (sighs) I just want to know where he is. If he's sleeping. (tool whirring) - No, no records. Not a white van. Let me see that picture again will ya? No he wasn't here. I'd recognize him. Hey Bob? Bob? Who closed up last Friday? - Uh I wasn't in on Friday. Uh, Kevin was. - Alright. Kevin? Hey, you closed up last Friday hm? - Friday? - Yeah, this young fellow look familiar? Came in last Friday with a white camper. - With Ontario license plates. - You thought it might be the fuel injection. - White? - Yeah. - No. No I don't recall. - But you closed up last Friday? - I think I did. Yeah, I did. - Do you remember seeing this boy? - No. No. Something happen? - My son, he's disappeared. - Oh. Damn. Wasn't here. - Pretty rough. Missing kid. Sorry. - [Mechanic] Jack it up higher! That's it. - So I fitted the kids cast to his arm, and I told him he'd have to wear it about a month. So all this time his kid brother is standing up looking at that cast as envious as all hell. And he finally he turns to me and he says, could you do somethin' like that for me (laughs)? - Dad pull over. (somber music) It's no use. We're not gonna find him. (somber music) (seatbelt rattling) (door slams) (somber music) (whimpering) (somber music) (birds chirping) - Hi Doug. (birds chirping) (letter rustling) Steven! (birds chirping) Steven! Steven! Steven! (lawn mower whirring) Steven! It's a letter from Bank Master addressed to Brian. (lawn mower motor ticking) - In regard to the travelers checks you reported stolen on July 12th. We will need additional information. Will you please fill out the enclosed form and return it to us in the envelope? - Brian called them. - Yes, we sent this letter addressed to Brian Walker. - [Joan] Who reported the check stolen? - Well, Brian Walker. - [Joan] Where was he? - I'm sorry? - [Steven] Where did the call come from? - I don't understand. - My brother is missing. - [Bank Teller] Pardon? - Brian left home three weeks ago. Four days later he called from Nebraska. We haven't heard from him since. Then we got this letter informing us that he had contacted you by phone. So what we want to know is where was the call placed from? - I'm sorry ma'am, we can't give you that information. - What do you mean? - Well, it's private client information. We can't release it. Not without Brian's permission. - But he's missing. (Bank Teller sighs) - Well I'm sorry but we have an obligation to our clients to protect the privacy of those clients. - Can't you understand? We can't get Brian's permission because he's disappeared. - Well I admit your circumstances are unusual. But it is company policy. - I am trying to find my son. - I hear you ma'am, but frankly there's really, there is no way we can release that information. Not without a court order. - Fine. We'll get a court order. - Thank you. (phone ringing) (officers chattering) - I'm, I'm sorry the order was denied. - Why for God's sakes? - Because there's no reason to believe that a crime's been committed and without evidence of a crime the court will not compel disclosure. - Did you explain to them? - Yes I did, exactly as you told me, but without sufficient cause the court refuses. They feel it's outside their mandate. They can't presume that a law's been violated. I'm sorry. (birds chirping) (doors slamming) (birds chirping) - Steven? - [Steven] What is it? - Brian's credit card slips. - What? (paper tearing) - From gas stations in Matsue, Saint Paul, Omaha. - This one's from Colorado. - He did get to Colorado. - Keenesburg? - I don't even know where that is. - Where's the atlas? (pages flipping) - [Rob] Keenesburg. - [Joan] Well it's outside of Boulder. - [Steven] But he never arrived at school. July 9th, Butler Colorado. - [Joan] No that's south past Bolder. - July 11th, Rush, I can't read this. Rush Falls, New Mexico. 17th, El Paso. - [Joan] Go on. - Uh, July 18th, Cheyenne. - [Joan] Wyoming? - There's one more. July 19th, Oakley, Kansas. This is crazy. The van went south to Texas then back up north and now it seems to be going east. - Yeah, we better make a list of these stops. - Mom? This last set, these signatures. Look at the W. It's different from the others. - Where? - Here. See these loops? They're tighter. Brian doesn't make these tight loops. - Well you can't tell from a signature Honey. - Yeah but look at the way he closes out his A's. - Well maybe he signed them sitting in the car or standing outside. You know what it's like on the road. - Mom, I don't think this is Brian's handwriting. - You can't tell from a scribble on a credit slip Steven. Where you going? - Here's one of Brian's stories. Look at his signature. See these wide loops? And Brian always ends on an upstroke. - Well, alright. Maybe he signed it when he was in a hurry. - Mom these are not his signatures. Somebody got ahold of his credit card. After Keenesburg Brian wasn't in the van. All I'm saying is we have to be prepared. - We do not. - Brian might be dead. - How can you say that? From a signature? - Yes because if you look here you will see- - There's no proof, is there? Is there? (footsteps receding) (heels clattering) (typewriter keys clacking) (phone ringing) (officers chattering) (phone ringing) Sergeant Keyes? - Oh yes, Ms. Walker? (phone ringing) - Um, I know that you said you'd call if, you heard anything about Brian but it's already August so I thought I'd just check and see if anything's come up? On the computer. - Oh, oh, oh, no. Look uh, look we, we really been swamped. - [Joan] What do you mean you've been swamped? - Well we've really been pressed and I just haven't had a chance to. - Are you telling me that his name is not on that computer? My God! What do I have to do to make you people understand - oh, hold it! - my son is missing! - Yes, wait a minute! Wait a minute! - [Joan] Get away from me! - [Sergeant Keyes] Sit down. - I want my son's name in that computer now! His name is Brian Walker. Sit down and put it on there right now. - Let's go outside. - I am not leaving here until I get a printout with my sons name on it in my hand. - You will, I promise you. - Sit down! - Just, if you'll just please-- - Brian Walker! I want it in my hand or I'm not leaving. (typewriter keys clacking) (police scanner chattering) (phone ringing) (police scanner chattering) (phone ringing) (birds chirping) (phone ringing) (birds chirping) Steven! (phone ringing) (birds chirping) Hello? - [Sergeant Frasier] Mrs. Walker? - Yes. - [Sergeant Frasier] This is Sergeant Frasier with the Portland, Maine Police. - Where? - Portland, Maine. Mrs. Walker, did you report a 1976 Volkswagen camper missing? - Yes. - We have it. Had a hard time finding you. The van had Texas plates on it. Finally tracked you through Volkswagen in Germany (laughs). (officers chattering) We have the van. - Where's Brian? - [Officer Frasier] Who? - My son Brian who was driving the van. Where is he? - What bothered the hell out of me, why this camper with Texas plates was never reported stolen. - Well it was, just took 'em three weeks to put it on the computer. - It's often done that way. Whoever processed the information entered the Ontario license plate number but not the serial number of the van itself. Took us a whole month to find you. - The van has been here for a month? - Well it took us that long to chase you down. We talked to the FBI, we called out through the Midwest, Texas, went through local police agencies, but we always got the standard well, we'll look into that and get right back to you. Course that could take 10, 12 years from now. - How did the van get here to the other end of the country? - Well we picked up these two men driving it. They tried to sell a stolen tape deck to a city councilman of all people. Here, Mrs, Walker sit down please. Uh, not very bright. - Well who are these men? - Locals. The younger one was put into a foster home. The older one who had a previous stolen car charged against him, we got him in jail. - Did he say anything about Brian? - Well his first story which he's changed a few times since was that he picked up the van in Colorado from a blonde curly haired kid. - Oh my God. - That's Brian. (typewriter keys clacking) - He said that the kid gave him the van. - [Steven] Gave it to him? - And then the kid disappeared. He never saw him again. - Brian would never give him the van. - He's lying. - I know. (typewriter keys clacking) - Well do you know these men? - The one in jail. Earl Pike. He um, he has a police record. (typewriter key clacking) - Could he have killed Brian? - Steven that doesn't make sense. Why would anybody kill somebody and then describe them to the police? (typewriter keys clacking) (footsteps receding) - It's in the compound out back. (footsteps receding) (birds chirping) (door latching) It's pretty messed up. (kids playing) (Sergeant Frasier grunts) Maybe you should let your son. - I want to see. (tense music) (birds chirping) (door sliding) (tense music) (birds chirping) (Joan sobbing) (footsteps receding) (tense music) (door latching) (tense music) - Steven? Steven? I'm gonna go bowling with Lon and Grady so uh, tell mom I'll be back later. - What the hell are you wearing? - Huh? - Who said you could wear Brian's sweater? - Well nobody but-- - [Steven] Well take it off. - Why? - Take the damn sweater off. We don't go into other people's things in this house. - What are you talkin' about? Brian let's me wear his clothes all the time. - Well not now. Take it off. Take off that sweater! - No. - Take it off! - No! - Take it off! - Steven are you crazy? If Brian was here he'd let me wear this sweater. - Well that's just it, he's not here. Do you see him? Come here, give me that sweater! Come here! - No! - Here! Take it off! - [Rob] No! - Take off the sweater! - No! - Take off that sweater! - No! - Boys! Hey, hey! What's going on? Cut it out. What is this? - He wants me to take the sweater off. I don't know what's goin' on around here. You tell me not worry about Brian, everything's gonna be okay (sobs), and Steven's acting like he's dead. - Rob? Rob? (door slams) (keys jingling) What was all that? Huh? Oh Steven, you've been through a lot. We all have Honey but, you know we're closer than ever to getting some answers. - No we're not. I spoke to Frasier today. He said he turned the case over to the Assistant District Attorney two week's ago. Some woman named Towler. - Two weeks ago? Has she charged Pike? - No. He's got to be near the end of his sentence. If he gets out we'll never find out what happened to Brian. (horns honking) (footsteps approaching) - Well thanks for coming to meet us. - I have something to show you. Pike's criminal record. - Car theft, assault and battery, breaking and entering. - Arrested in Florida for grand larceny 1971, sentenced to two and a half years. Arrested the next year for robbery and assault. He got seven years for that. Grand larceny again in Alabama just two years later. He never served a full sentence. - He was out committing two or three new crimes. - Mrs. Walker, four days before Pike met Brian in Colorado he was picked up in Pennsylvania riding in a stolen car. Now the Pennsylvania Police ran a computer check on him and found out that he was wanted here in Maine. But because of a limited budget, the state didn't spend the $200 it would've cost to have him extradited. If Pike had been extradited we would've had him. He would've never met Brian. There's something else you should know. Pike's being released this afternoon. - What? Thank you. (heels clattering) - There are the elevators, right there. (heels clattering) Miss Towler? - Yes? - I'm Steven Walker, this is my mother Joan Walker. - I'm sorry, I was expecting you this afternoon. - Is it true that Earl Pike is being released from prison this afternoon? - Yes that's right. - Why for God's sakes? - There was nothing I could do. Look I'm due in court for 10 minutes. Do you mind if we walk while we talk? Pike served the compulsory two thirds of his sentence and the judge granted him automatic reduction. - On what basis? - Good behavior. - Good behavior? Do you know this mans criminal record? - Of course I know, but under the law he's entitled-- - Under the law? He stole my sons van. Can't you charge him with theft? - [Miss Towler] We had no evidence. - Well how the hell do you think he got it? - Let me explain something about the law in this country. First of all, when the van was picked up Pike wasn't driving. Secondly we have the burden of proof. So if there's another reasonable explanation for Pike having the van such as your sun giving it to him, we'd be thrown out of court. - Well where in God's name would he be right now? - Well who knows? For all we know he could be picking strawberries. - Strawberries? My brother could be in little pieces on some hillside 2,000 miles away from here and you're letting his killer walk free. What's the matter with you people? - Oh, listen to me. As soon as we slap Pike with a theft charge his lawyer will demand a probable cause hearing in district court, and I can tell you now the charge won't stick simply because we don't have enough evidence for a conviction. - [Joan] Well what about the driver of the van? Question him. - [Miss Towler] We can't. - [Joan] Why not? - He disappeared. - What? - He beat up the mother in his foster home and he took off. - Miss Towler? We don't care about Pike. It's not Pike but he's the only person who knows what happened to my son. - Okay. What we can do is ask Pike to take a lie detector test. Perhaps we can arrange a meeting with him. - A meeting? - Have him talk to you. Tell you what he knows about your son. Maybe I can set that up. I'd have to call him and see if he agrees to it. - We need his permission? - There's nothing I can do. He's gonna be a free man. (footsteps shuffling) He passed the polygraph test. Pike never saw your son. He'll be down in a few minutes. He's agreed to talk to you as a, these are his words, as a curtesy to you and out of concern for the family. You should know that he's been officially released and we had to warn him that whatever he says can be used against him. (footsteps approaching) (gentle music) - I'm sorry about what happened to your son. - Well we don't know what happened to my son. - Do you? - No. - [Miss Towler] This way. (footsteps receding) (door unlatching) (Joan's throat clearing) - Mr. Pike, you're the last person that we know of that saw Brian. - I'm sorry ma'am but I've never seen your son. - [Joan] But you described him. (sighs) - I've never seen him. - How can you deny that? You have his van. (sighs) - Well, I don't know about that ma'am because see I got the van from a guy named John. - [Steven] Who's John? - John was the guy drivin' the van that picked us up. - [Steven] Where? - Texas. - [Steven] When? - You know look, Frasier's got all this information. - What day? - July 8th. - That's impossible. Brian called us on the night of the 7th from Nebraska. Said the van had broken down. It couldn't possibly be in Texas by July 8th. - You know maybe it was the 9th. You know I, I don't really remember. (Joan sighs) - What uh, happened to this person John? - Well, see we run into a little problem in Nebraska. - And what kind of problem? - I don't know. You know he and Mason, they, they got into a thing. And John got mad, he took off. Left us the van. - Left you the van. - Yeah. I mean I didn't steal it. - Did you know it was stolen? - No. I know a little bit about stolen vehicles too. - This is a picture of Brian. Did you ever see him? - No. - Mr. Pike did you kill my son? - No. Hey look, are we finished here? You know 'cause I gotta, I gotta get goin'. I got to drive down to Connecticut. Got to rent a new apartment. (door creaking) (door latching) (rain falling) (door latching) (rain falling) (door latching) (rain falling) - Listen, there's some things left from the van that weren't mine. Might be your sons. Do you want to go take a look? The diner around the corner. (rain falling) - You're not going with him. - Mom I'll be alright. Why don't you just wait inside. - Steven! (rain falling) (tense music) (rain falling) - [Pike] You know I've never been to Ottawa. Is it nice? (tense music) (rain falling) Come on. (rain falling) Hey Notch. (bag thuds) (box shuffling) Here you go kid. (box thuds) (newspaper crinkling) (tense music) - Where's my brother? What did you do to him? Where is he? Where is he? (pans clattering) What did you do to him? (tense music) (horn whistle blowing) (train wheels creaking) - [Conductor] Watch you step. Watch your step. Yes ma'am. - That must be him. - [Announcer] Express with from Boston now arriving on the track. - [Joan] He's older than I expected him to be. - [Announcer] Now arriving on track. - Mr. Conway? - [Jim] Yeah? - Steven Walker. My mother Joan Walker. - Yeah, good to meet ya (chuckles). I just made it. You know after 15 years you'd think I'd know enough not to mess with New Haven traffic at noon. Uh, there's a, there's a coffee shop down there. Why don't we go sit down? So, tell me uh, how'd you get my name? - [Joan] Detective Frasier in Portland, Maine. - [Jim] Oh. Well I don't know why you chased all the way down here. Like I told you on the phone there's no way I can take the case. Frasier huh? He's a good cop. - How you do know him? - Oh I used to be a cop myself. 30 years for New York City. I come from an Irish Catholic family. Already had a brother who was a priest so. Yeah but in those days it was an honor. Really was. Felt good about helping people. - Did you read the material we sent you? - Yeah. Yeah I read it. It's a damn travesty. - [Joan] We hope that'd it'd convince you to take the case. - [Jim] Oh I can't, really. See I'm workin' on somethin' up in Syracuse and uh, well I'm all jammed up. - [Joan] We did some checking. Pike's moved from Maine. He's living nearby in Hartford. - [Jim] Yeah, yesterday his wife filed assault charges against him. Beat the hell out of her. - How do do you know that? - I checked. - Look, Mr. Conway? Can't you just go up to Maine and speak to the District Attorney and the Federal Prosecutor? (Jim laughs) - You know what people like that think of private investigators? You know what the cops think of PI's? They think I'm an adversary. They'd like to hang me. - Even if you're gonna help them with a case? - They don't want help. They spend their time on the phone making sure they don't get caught with their pants down. It's a waist of time going to Maine. - Well, what would you suggest? - Pie (laughs). They make a terrific strawberry pie here. You know my wife Olga's trying to get me to cut out desserts but I sneak a piece of strawberry pie every once in awhile. I mean who wants to live to be 100? - No thanks. I'll just have coffee. - No, me too. - [Announcer] Your attention please? New Haven to New York. - Fuck. - [Announcer] To Stanford. - There were two of them in that van to Portland. The younger one was put in a foster home and he ran away. Nobody's even bothered to follow up on him. If you would just go there and look for him. - The answer is in those travelers checks. - [Steven] What do you mean? - Travelers check. When was the last time you talked to the bank about them? - A month ago. They have no record of the checks being cashed. - Can't be. They clear those checks in a matter of days. Something's wrong. - [Steven] We had them check the serial numbers through the computer and nothing came up. - Nobody is gonna steal checks and then not cash them. That doesn't make sense. See, they've got um, you got credit card slips, you got travelers checks. Now probably nobody's gonna remember the credit cards but travelers checks, now sometimes people do remember them. Plus these days they got those cameras and sometimes they take pictures of people cashing the checks. You see Pike says that he never even saw your son but if got a picture of him with one of those checks in his hand, you know bingo. There's your boy. That would be beautiful. Uh, and then maybe somebody saw him. See then you're in business. You got to follow through on those travelers checks. - But what if the checks were never cashed? I mean what if Brian hid them or destroyed them or whatever? What then? - Then you're out of luck. (cup clattering) - Mr. Conway, I don't know what to do. I mean people tell me that I should give up. You know, get on with my life. That Brian's dead. I don't know anymore. But if he is, I don't want him lying in some field. I want him brought home. (dishes clattering) (engine rumbling) (chattering) - [Man] Come on we're gonna be late. - [Boy] Let's see that radio you got. - [Woman] She's got a headache! - [Girl] Where you going? - Uh, excuse me uh, does an Earl Pike live here? - What about? - [Jim] You Earl Pike? - Yeah. - Could I talk to you for a second? - Sure. Nah, nah, nah you got to go around. - [Jim] Okay. It's uh, it's about a van. Uh, a Volkswagen van. See I'm an insurance adjuster. I work for Colonial Heritage. And boy, it's hot today. I'm runnin' may tail off. (panting) Whew. You know, I get 30 bucks from each one of these contacts I make and if I do you I get 60 bucks you see, who needs it? I'm gettin' too old for this. (grunts) Anyway these people put in a claim for 1,000 bucks on the van. It's one of those nuisance cases. And I don't want to bother you with it but I thought maybe you might know something about that van. (man whistles) - Um, some guy gave it to me. (chuckles) - A guy gave it to ya (laughs)? I wish somebody's give me a van. Nice guy (laughs). (Jim grunts) (neighbors chattering) Well when I got to the van, it was uh, it was all torn up inside and I thought you know, what happened? I thought maybe you might know. - Yeah it was all torn up when I got it too. - Yeah? Hey could I have one of those? - Sure. - Hey Honey? - [Woman] Yeah? - Can you bring us down another beer? - [Woman] Okay. - Hey, did you hear this one? What do you call a 62 year old prostitute? (neighbors chattering) (Jim and Pike laughing) - [Pike] Thanks Honey. - Pike is our boy. - [Joan] What do we do now? - No you don't have to do anything. I'll handle it. I got to get a look at those travelers checks. Get 'em to run 'em through again. - Okay. - [Jim] Goodbye. - Bye. (phone clicks) - [Bob] We ran those tapes through already. - Yeah (laughs) but do me a favor. Look uh, I'm a suspicious son of a gun. It's my nature. I don't trust these gadgets. Run the numbers through again will ya? - Yeah? Well if you don't trust these gadgets what's the point of me runnin' them through again? - Well I'm guessin' it wasn't the kid who reported 'em stolen but maybe the guys that took him. - Happens all the time. - It does? - Sure. People think they can uh, get the money twice. It looks like they cashed five of them. - Just get me the hard copies. There were three checks cashed in Colorado and two in Utah. - [Joan] So, will you go out there? - [Jim] Yeah, I'm flying to Denver first thing in the morning. - [Joan] Okay well call me from there huh? - [Jim] Okay. (airplane engine whirring) (gentle music) - No. You say the kid's missin'? - Yeah. Possibly murdered. (gentle music) Now what about this guy? Sure ya, (laughs) sure you'd remember him now. - Look, Mister we have, we have you know how many credit cards a day? Hundreds. - Yeah? - Besides uh, most of the guys workin' here in the summer they gone back to school. - Okay. - I'm sorry. (phone ringing) - Hi. Remember me? - Oh, hi Maggie. - You're gonna disappear right into that map if you're not careful. - Oh I know. Ever since Conway's been out there it's like, I'm more him than I am me. When I wake up in the morning I don't even see what I see anymore. I see what I imagine he's seeing. (phone ringing) He's my eyes and ears. Think I'm going crazy? (laughs) - They were drivin' a, a white van. Uh, it's uh, you sure you don't recognize either one of these guys? I mean they don't look like somebody buyin' ice cream. (gentle music) - No mom's not home. - Yeah well tell her I'm down to my last lead. It's a motel about 60 miles from here. Tell her if that doesn't pan out uh, I'm goin' home. Okay. Bye. (phone clicks) (gentle music) (gravel crunching) (birds chirping) Excuse me? Yeah I'm looking for somebody that cashed some travelers checks here back in July. - Well I wouldn't be able to help you with that. I didn't own the place back then. - Well what about the former owner? Uh, do you know where he went? - Ben Loder (smirks)? Last I know he was livin' in uh, Cross Keys. - How far away is that from here? - About 400 miles. - [Jim] Do you know where I might find him there? - Yeah south end of Old Pokes Road. You're not gonna go all the way out there are ya? Take ya eight hours. (birds chirping) - Hi. (birds chirping) Mr. Loder? Ben Loder? - What? - Are you Ben Loder? - Yep. What can I do for ya? - You uh, you used to own the motel back at Fairmont? - That's right. - You ever remember seeing these guys back in July? (birds chirping) - No, can't say that I do. - Please look. It's very important. I just drove 400 miles. Take another look. - Well, you're talkin' almost three months ago. My memory's not as good as it used to be (laughs). Uh, anything else I can do for ya? - No. No, thanks anyway. (birds chirping) - [Announcer] Flight number 723 for Vancouver now boarding at gate number seven. Flight number 723 for Vancouver now boarding at gate number seven. Miss Levison. Miss C. Levison, please be-- - I'm sorry to drag you all the way out to the airport Mrs. Walker. - It's okay. - I went to every stop on the credit card list. I even uh, I even tried the Vegas Police. - What did they say? - They said there's a lot of missing kids out there. (Jim grunts) - [Announcer] Flight number 723-- - What do you recommend? - [Announcer] For Vancouver now boarding at-- - Not wasting anymore of your money. - Money isn't important. - Your husband have any ideas? - He's doing all he can in Los Angeles but it's a long way away. - Well we just run out of leads. - What do I do? - I think you've done it. - What do I do now? - Well you've, you've contacted the police, the FBI, you've looked on your own, your son's quite his job to search for the boy, you've gone to campgrounds, hospitals. You even hired a private investigator. - [Announcer] At gate 12. - Are you telling me to quit? - [Announcer] Flight number nine for Toronto boarding at gate 12. (Joan sighs) Thanks for coming all this way. (airport members chattering) (typewriter keys clacking) (gasps) Steven I completely forgot. - Never thought I'd get stood up by my own mother. - Aw, I'm sorry Honey. Listen maybe you better go without me huh? - [Steven] It's not that great a movie anyway. We can just have dinner. - Well, let me just finish here. (paper rustling) - Mom you've already written to the hospitals. - I know, I know but I only heard back from about half of 'em. - What's this about depression? Brian didn't have a history of psychological depression. - Yesterday I spoke to a hospital administrator. He said that they might look a little harder for a missing kid if they thought he had some kind of special problem or something. Depression was all I could think of. (Joan sighs) You know what's funny? I actually found myself wondering if it was wrong to lie. - He'd be furious. - Same thing I thought. (cookware clattering) - Olga? Olga? What are you doing? - What do you mean what am I doing? I'm packing. - [Jim] What's the roasting pan for? - You told me they had a kitchen. - Olga, this is a vacation. We're gonna eat out. - It's not right. - [Jim] What? - We've never spent Thanksgiving away from the children. (Jim smirks) - They're not children anymore. They're grown up. They're married. They got families of their own and this year they're gonna spend Thanksgiving dinner with their in-laws. - We always spend Thanksgiving at home. - What are we gonna do at home? The two of us? Olga. We're only goin' to New Hampshire. And we'll have turkey dinner in a restaurant, like downtown. I'm still good for a few laughs. - Okay, so we'll go to New Hampshire. (Jim laughs) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Jim? Bob Jacobs. Look Jim we just punched out 10 more checks. - What are you talkin' about? - [Bob] 10 checks were cashed back in July and we just popped 'em out now. - Well did you know there were more checks? - [Bob] Look, don't ask me to explain. - Well, give me the states huh? - Utah, Colorado, Nebraska. - Yeah okay. Bob um, listen uh, do me a favor um, send me photo static copies of those checks okay? Yeah, express them up. Yeah, thanks. (phone clicks) Uh Olga, uh, where's Mrs. Walker's phone number? - [Olga] It's in her file, right in front of you. - Okay. (paper rustling) Oh. (buttons clicking) Uh, Olga? How would you like to go to Utah? (gentle music) (engine rumbling) (gentle music) Want to come in? - No, no. I'll wait here. - Come on, it's okay. - No you go on, I'll, I'll wait in the car. (gentle music) - No. No. - Thanks. (gentle music) - No. - Okay, okay. (gentle music) (dish thuds) (restaurant members chattering) - Turkey's good. - Turnip's delicious. (restaurant members chattering) - You look nice. (restaurant members chattering) (crickets chirping) - Steven? - Did I scare you? I felt like being in his room. Look what I found. - What? - Remember the watch he accused Rob of losing? He swore he'd never let him borrow anything again. Said he'd lose his underwear if it didn't have elastic. Found it in the bottom drawer of his desk. Still running. (door slams) - The sky's dark. It's gonna rain. - Nah, it's not gonna rain. (luggage thuds) (rain falling) (thunder booming) (rain falling) (Jim groans) Look, you want to spend the night here? We can check in. - You said we had one more check stop. - Yeah but it's not for another 40 miles. - Oh come on, we'll go for it. - You don't like drivin' in heavy rain. - Oh it's okay. I'm having a good time. (rain falling) (gentle music) How close are we to Nebraska? - About 25 miles. - We got to get to the Jules Burke Motor Works. Brian cashed four checks there. - $80 worth. - Yeah. Coulda been the place where he had the repair work done. - Oh yes. So good. So good. Oh yes. Yeah. Nice work. - I think we just got lucky. Come on. (dog barking) (door sliding) - Yeah you're right. It's not in the book. - They weren't here. - Yeah but, they were towed here. The uh, the guy said they brought 'em in about 7 o'clock, a Friday night just before you were closing. - They weren't here I'm tellin' ya. Look, you checked the books yourself. There was no work done on a VW camper. - Yeah but the tow man said that they brought-- - The guy made a mistake, what can I tell ya? We got to close. - [Jim] Well. - Fine. (door sliding) (footsteps shuffling) - Now Olga, I'll bet you that's the law. (engine rumbling) (brakes squealing) - Excuse me folks? (door slams) FBI, Agent Drake. - Jim Conway. This is my wife Olga. - [Agent Drake] Ma'am. - How do you do? - What uh, brings you here Mr. Conway. - Little investigative work. - Who for? - Family in Ottawa. Kid named Brian Walker's been missing for awhile. - We're active on that case Mr. Conway. - [Jim] Oh, that's good to hear. - We've already talked to the people here a couple times. - [Jim] What'd they tell ya? - He wasn't here. - Yeah that's what they told me. - We checked a couple of other places he might've stopped. Repair shop, hotel. To tell you the truth I don't think the boy was ever anywhere near North Platte. - Well I don't know. That's uh, that's what I came here to find out. - We can handle whatever's necessary on this end Mr. Conway. Not much point in duplicating our efforts. - Well I guess you fellas know your business. - We try. - Good talkin to ya. - Same here. Ma'am. - Have we just been told to get outta town? (footsteps shuffling) - That guy was lying. - Who? - The guy at the service station. - Why would he lie? - I don't know. - But if Brian was here and it was late, he had to stay some place. Some place around here. - Where are you going? - Check the register. - You already did. - No, no. Motel across the road. - Oh, come on Jim. It's late. Let's get to bed. You can check it out in the morning. - Okay. (traffic whirring) - What did you say that date was? - July 14th. Here, do you mind? - Oh, well that was over four months ago. I don't know if I'd remember. We have a photograph. Jim, where are the photographs? Here. - Oh my, yes I remember him. - Here it is. Brian Walker. - My God. - Yes, we had a long talk. He told me all about his family. - Now please. This is very important. Was there anybody with him? - [Hotel Manager] Now that I don't remember. - Jim it says he paid for three people. - Do you remember the other two? Please. - I'm afraid I don't. - Was it either one of these two? - I don't remember. But I remember the boy. He was very polite. I believe he said he was from Canada. - Anything else? - Well, he mentioned he had some trouble with his car. Thank you very much. - Thank you. (footsteps approaching) - Listen, you're gonna stop jerkin' me around. - What are you talkin'-- - The boy was here. - No he wasn't here. - I just talked with the motel across the road. The kid spent the night across the road. That means the van was here. I got the guy who says he put it here, the motel has the kids name on the register, the woman over there says she talked to him. What are you gonna tell me now? I'm crazy? - I don't have him down. He's not in the book! - Because you pocketed the money, right? The boss wasn't around. You did some fast jugglin'. Now to save your own butt you could be hiding a murderer. Okay? Now what do you want to tell me? So? - He was here. (Kevin sighs) - These guys with him? - Yeah. This one, this ugly creep. I got into an argument with him. - What about? - He wanted me to fix the van that night. I told him it's closing time, take a hike and he went crazy. - You remember the kid? - Yeah. I remember him. He looked scared. He wanted to shake these guys but he didn't know how. I felt sorry for him. I wanted, I want, I don't know. I wanted to say run kid, run like hell. - Why didn't ya? (footsteps shuffling) - And then a week later when his old man and his brother came by I figured, whatever happened to the kid it's over now. Not much good I could do. - How much money did you pocket? - 40 bucks. (footsteps receding) (footsteps thudding) (typewriter keys clacking) - The kid was here. Had the van repaired in the shop down the road. - Who says? - Guy who repaired it. - Like hell. - I was in that shop. - Didn't go on the books. Kid pocketed the money, didn't want to admit it. You mind if I use your phone? - What for? - Call your office in Connecticut. (buttons clicking) The kid spent the night in the motel right here. - I checked out half a dozen motels. - Yeah? Well you missed the one down the street. Agent Cameron please. - Agent Cameron, FBI. - Yeah, Jim Conway. Listen, you can bring in Pike and Mason. I put it together. - You sure you got enough? - [Jim] Yeah, but let question them okay? - Why should I do that? - Because I got the leverage. I don't care what you do after that. Just have 'em there first thing in the morning. - Oh they'll be here first thing. Okay. Bye bye. (phone clicking) Now I got to tell the family. (phone thuds) (vacuum whirring) (door slams) (birds chirping) It's over. (birds chirping) - Did you find him? - I put Pike and Mason and your son together in a repair shop in North Platte, Nebraska. (birds chirping) - Are you sure? - [Jim] Yes. - Do you know where my son is? - You'll find that out from Pike. (birds chirping) - You didn't actually see Brian? - [Jim] Mrs. Walker they were together. Pike and Mason took the van from him. They used his credit card. - Yeah but you didn't actually see him. - They cashed his travelers checks. (birds chirping) - Yeah, but isn't is possible that-- - No. (birds chirping) (Joan sobbing) (typewriter keys clacking) - [Agent Cameron] We wrapped it up. - What do you mean? - They confessed. - Who confessed? - Pike and Mason. - You were gonna wait for me. - Oh we took care of it. - Like hell. You coulda blown it. - No way. We were about to pull in Mason anyway. - What are you talkin' about? - We tested the stolen travelers checks for prints two weeks ago. Mason's were on 'em. - Two weeks ago. Why didn't you bring him in then? - Didn't get around to it. - Isn't that an amazing coincidence? You had those prints for two weeks. You waited until my phone call before you brought 'em in. - The Bureau has its own priorities Mr. Conway. - You sat on your hands for four months and now you want the credit for breaking the case. That's your priority. I don't even think you ran those checks. I think you're a liar. (footsteps shuffling) Stay with 'em. (door slams) Um, Mrs. Walker this is Agent Cameron. Uh, Steven Walker. - [Agent Cameron] Good to meet you. - Right. - I'm glad we could wrap this thing up for you folks. - Can we talk to Pike? - No. No, no, no, we're taking a statement from him right now. Will you folks take a seat? (footsteps receding) (door slams) (Pike sighs) - We ran into the kid on the side of the road. His van had broken down. He was waitin' for a tow truck. I said we'd help him if he could give us a ride to Colorado. You know, we didn't want to take him. I mean we just wanted his money, van, travelers checks. Figured when we got to Colorado, crossed the boarder we stopped for gas, we'd get him then. (birds chirping) When we stopped the kid took his travelers checks into the gas station with him so we had to wait. (tense music) Then when we were gettin' close to Boulder, to where he was gonna drop us off, we had to do somethin' alright? We had to get rid of him. (tense music) - [Brian] You know I'm, I'm goin' up to Boulder so I guess uh, this is where I can let you off. - Uh, thanks for the ride. - Sure. - Hey! - Get on the floor. - [Brian] Hey stop! Help! Somebody! (fist punching) (tense music) (engine revving) (tense music) (tense music) (Brian grunting) (engine revving) - Then I realized that was pretty stupid because, someone was gonna find him. He'd talk. They could get us for kidnapping. (tense music) (tires squealing) (engine revving) (doors slamming) (tense music) - Oh my God he's not there. - [Pike] Get down there and find him. (snow sliding) Look over there. (Brian groaning) (tense music) (Brian yelling) - So, Mason and I, we got in an argument about what to do with him and we should be, (sighs) get rid of the kid, ditch the van, keep the van. He could identify us you know? I know the penalty for kidnapping. Same as it is for murder. - [Agent Cameron] Where was Brian during this time? - [Pike] He was in the back tied up. - [Agent Cameron] He was listening? - Yeah, I guess he was. (scoffs) (tense music) Well, it was gettin' pretty late. We were runnin' low on gas. We couldn't take a chance in stoppin' anywhere with the kid in the van. So, we had to do somethin'. So we killed him. (engine revving) (Brian yelling) (Pike and Mason grunting) So we killed him. (Brian screaming) So we killed him. (Brian screaming) So we killed him. (Brian groaning) (water rushing) (door latching) - He's confessed to the murder of your son. - Did he say where Brian is? - Gave us a general location. - Can we go get him? - Well we phoned the authorities in Colorado. There's a heck of a snow storm up there. - What? - It's snowing. It'll be awhile before they can get some men up there to go search. - I want my brother brought home. - Well Steven, right now-- - Look, I want my brother brought home now! - Well there's now way they'll go up and look in the middle of a snow storm. - Hey I don't care if it's snowing. I want him brought up now. - [Agent Cameron] Steven, I understand how you feel-- - No you don't. I don't believe you understand how he feels or how I feel or how anyone feels, who's been through something like this. And what I don't understand, what I'll never understand, is why nobody lifted a hand to find Brian or the men who killed him. - We found your son Mrs. Walker. - I found my son. I and Steven and this man found my son. - Our Nebraska office put a lot of time in on this. We processed the travelers checks. I believe we did our job. - We did your job. All you people did was come up with reasons why nothing could be done and you didn't give a damn about Brian. - The man who killed Brian is in the next room in my custody. - I find little comfort in that. All I want now is to be able to bury my son. (heels clattering) (gentle music)
