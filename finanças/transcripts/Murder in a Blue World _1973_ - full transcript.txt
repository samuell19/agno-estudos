We have to celebrate your prize with a good dinner. I know a nice little place, you'll like it. Soft music. Excellent steaks. Gorgeous view. All right. But remember, it's not a celebration. I don't think it's all that important to have this medal. But it is important that we have dinner together, you and I. Victor, let's not start all that again, please. I promise we'll talk about something else tonight. Make you happy? OK, 8 o'clock. I won't make you wait. What are you thinking? I don't know. Nothing. It's strange, you know? What's strange? You've got all the best qualifications to be an excellent medic. You've got talent, personality, your patients have confidence in you. But yet you're content with being a health officer. Takes all types to make a world. And anyway the work you do, you doctors, surgeons, neurologists... It really doesn't interest me. Hmm, you're not serious? It's all so infallible. So technical. Any operation, no matter how complicated, just... Isn't the adventure that it used to be. It's all so precise. So technical. My work is different. I talk to my patients. Reassure them. I make them feel better. And then when I know that nothing's possible... I don't start experimenting the way you do. Mmm... A doctor shouldn't be a good Samaritan. I'm talking from experience, you know that, Ana. Love and pity don't help on the operating table. I don't mean to say that one is completely cold blooded. But don't get any illusions it doesn't make any difference whether you are dedicated to your work Or spend your money having fun, and people say you have a lot. Things would go on and still get done without you. What patients really want isn't love, they just don't want to die. Could be. It's the truth. Well, are you content? What do you mean? That we haven't stopped talking about other things. No, no, don't worry. We can keep this up all night. By the way, have you heard? That tomorrow night at 8... Yes, what? I'm giving a conference on television. Hmm. It will be a program of scientific devocation. I don't want to seem vain about it but, frankly, I would like very much for you to see me. On television: "No one in the course of the last few years thought of it becoming a reality so soon." "But as a matter of fact..." "Science is being born." "It really is beginning." "Especially the science dealing with something as complex..." "As the human mind." "Do as I do." "Feel sure of your manhood with the new Panther underwear." "The secret to intimate verility." "Every society for example shows a surplus of aggression. ” "Not only in groups but as individuals." "But where does this aggressiveness begin?" "Don't you recognize me? I represent the 20th century smile." "For generations, people have used DIV, the original toothpaste that is smooth," "And leaves your breath sweet and irresistible." It must be Uncle Oscar! I hope your brother doesn't stay too late. I've got to get up early. Don't worry. He's coming by to bring a present for the boy. "Now that you've seen the end of our program, dedicated to things scientific. ” "We shall offer our third movie program. ” "You will see the film A Clockwork Orange produced in 1972 by Warner Brothers." "And directed by Stanley Kubrick." "This is a symphony on the theme of violence." What do you want?! Please let the boy go! Listen, you can take whatever we have! I must say. You have a very pretty house. Believe me. Very pretty. You know I'm not saying it just to be POLITE! What do you want?! Please, I'll give you anything! Whoever saw mongrels like you... ...Living in such fancy homes? Because you are a mongrel, aren't you?! AREN'T YOU?! What do you say? Are you a mongrel? Or not? Huh? - PLEASE DON'T HURT HIM! - Shut up, bitch! My friend don't like to be bothered. Don't distract him! What did you say you were? M-mongrel. That's right. And how do mongrels walk? How do they walk?! HOW DO THEY WALK?! HOW DO THEY WALK?! That's right. Very good. And now tell me... How do they bark? Huh? How do they bark? How. Do. They. Bark? HOW DO THEY BARK?! W-woof! Woof! That's right. Lady, would you show me the way to the bedroom? You know here, in front of the child, it wouldn't be right. Bedroom, lady. Remember? Come on... Ask her if there's another bedroom for me! For me and her husband! She says you can use the same room as us! Nurse... What is it, Mr. Frans? Would you be so kind as to help me turn over? I'm dying, aren't I? I don't know, honestly. But I know. Yes, I know. I'm done for. Try not to talk. It's better if you rest. But what's the point of keeping my strength? I'm not getting any better by not talking. The charts... The lines on the charts show that I'm getting better. But I know. I'm not. Alright. Let's talk. What do you wanna talk about? I suppose you nurses are accustomed to having dying people tell you their life history. But don't worry. I'm not going to tell you anything. Why not? Because in my life there's nothing to tell. Oh. Everybody has something to say. I'm 70 years old, nurse. 70 years. And maybe it's possible, that in all that time... Most of the good things could take 4 or 5 hours of actual living. 4 or 5 hours. That's something. Some people don't even have that. You know something? I once read, I don't know where, that our whole world... ...Is no more than a place filled with dead people. Who think they are living. Can you imagine? Big cities full of dead people. Walking dead who work, suffer and love. And think they're living? I don't recall what it referred to, this book where I read this. You understand what I mean, don't you? Yes. I understand. Auctioneer: "Ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention please? Many thanks." We are now going to proceed to auction off the first item for today. As you all know from your programs, I am referring to the vignettes. And five which Alexander Raymond made for his universally famous Flash Gordon. As you see, they consist of enlargments which are unique and irreplaceable. They have been corrected by a special procedure: Photo Louvre. They both belong to the donation which Mr. Raymond presented to King Features Syndicate of the United States. "According to numerous investigations made by our expert. ” This work was done by Mr. Raymond toward the end of nineteen... Thirty-two. That's correct, thirty-two. Probably around the New Year. Flash Gordon, taken from the story by Joe Connolly, was first published on the 7th of January, 1933. We shall begin the auction for this item at fifty. - Interested? - "Ladies and gentlemen" I like it very much. But it's too bad Flash isn't in it. He's always been one of my favorites. Fifty is the opening bid. An exceptionally low price. Fifty-five! Fifty-five. Fifty-eight. Fifty-eight. The lady offers fifty-eight. As you must know, it was widely publicized in the press. "These works of art were discovered last winter, quite accidentally, during some excavation work which was carried out at 53rd Street in New York." Yes? Sixty! The young man offers sixty! Sixty-five. Sixty-five is offered by the young lady! Seventy. Seventy! Seventy-five! The young lady offers seventy-five! "Am I offered more? Is there a higher bid?" I say eighty! "Eighty! Do I hear more?" One hundred. Victor: You really like that. Auctioneer: "I'm offered one hundred!" A hundred. "One hundred going once. Twice. Three times." Sold to the young lady at one hundred! “Very well, ladies and gentlemen. ” "Now that we have completed the bidding of our first item, the first vignette of Flash Gordon." "We shall proceed with the second item which is scheduled for this afternoon." "As you all know... it pictures the right-hand glove of Cassius Clay." "When he won the title of heavyweight champion of the world." Auctioneer: "We will now show this valuable item in the collection. ” Ana: Here's my number. Call me. Auctioneer: "Ladies and gentlemen. We will start the bidding at fifteen." All right, that's enough! Let's go. But what do you mean? We're through here. Listen, you! I give the orders around here. You understand that? OK, but I'm leaving. So go! C'mon, let's go! Come on! Hurry up! Let's go! You made a mistake, David. I'm the one who decides when it's time to leave. Don't forget. I saw the helicopter with the police in it also. You do owe me an apology, don't you think? No. Forget it, Mik. There's no need for you to argue about it. Mik: Shut up! David: OK, Mik. If that's the way you want it. You're gonna kill him! Are you both mad?! Forgive me for being so late. But it was a little difficult finding your house. It's not important. Come in. Tony's a lovely name. I like it. What made you so sure I'd call? You're not mad about the auction? No, but I really wanted to buy them. I'm crazy about Flash Gordon. I've been saving up for some time to buy those pictures. What do you do? In a bank. An industrial bank. But evenings I study programming computer schemes. Do you like that? No. But it's the only way to get into a big company. Besides... Well, you know. For us with a physical defect, everything's a little bit harder. I understand. But I can do my job just as well as anybody else! Don't get so excited. Lie down. I want you to be calm. Relaxed. Defenseless. Poor Tony. You're gonna have to work so hard. You're very strange. What do you do? Do you work? Although with this house, it doesn't appear that. I work, but let's not talk about that now. "Don't try to do everything at once." "If you want to be useful to society, work at a specialized job." "A suggestion of the Department Of Social Ordinance." Announcer: "In sports, one attains perfection of the body and clearness of mind." “Let us all unite in providing a purer race." "This is the suggestion of the Department Of Physical Development. ” - Would you please turn it off? - "The planet Earth..." - Don't you uh.. like television? - ".. is blue..." Yes. I'm crazy about it. I spend hours and hours watching it. So? Oh, I don't know. When I'm with you I get the impression that a lot of things I found necessary before don't interest me at all now. Wanna know something? Since I was a child I imagined an affair like this tonight. In a house similar to this. With a woman like you. And now that you have it, are you happy? Yes. More than ever. And what's gonna happen tomorrow? You'll go back to your classes. Your office. And spend hours in front of the television set again. I don't want to think of that. May I stay the night here? I don't wanna go home tonight. Of course you can. The awful thing is I have to get up at 7 to go to work. Don't worry. I'll wake you up. Go to sleep. That's it. Have a happy dream. When we have time off, we can sleep well because we don't have to go to work the next day. And just think, we can have the whole day to ourselves.

Victor. Yes? N-no. Nothing. What is it, Ana? You've been trying to tell me something for ages. What's going on up in the third floor? I mean, a lotta people are talking at the medical center. All kinds of rumors are flying around. It's all so mysterious. Oh, so that's it. I might've guessed. Yes, there's something that we wanna keep secret. At least for now. But I guess there's no harm in telling you. We're trying out some new experiments to suppress criminal instincts. Operations on the brain? No, no. It's much more revolutionary. That's why, 'til now, they're only experiments. Electronic stimulation. What kind of patients do you use? Oh, oh. Delinquents. Habitual ones. Homicides, in most cases. The government is worried about the advancement of violence. Would you like to attend a session? Fine. Then come to the third floor tomorrow at 11 o'clock. Ana: Yes, but, well I don't know. Victor: No, don't worry. Victor: I'll come by to pick you up and take you. All we intend to do here... Is to cure your mind. Liberate you from those instincts which made you a murderer. We want you to be... A worthy citizen. Honest. Useful to society. And we shall try to do that. Only a few years ago, they would've hanged you. Or killed you with gas. Or you'd've rotted to death in prison. But instead, we are now going to get you integrated as a useful element. Within the law. Relax. Think of nothing. Do not think. Do not think. Nurse: First phase! Nurse: Second phase! Nurse: Third phase! I can always be sure of myself with my new Gold Panther underwear. The secret of intimate virility. No, no, no, Bruno! Can't you understand, we don't want to show you off. We want to show off the product! Bruno: Well, I-I thought... Director: You're not here to think! Now. Watch me. I... am always sure of myself... With my new Gold Panther shorts. The secret... of intimate virility. Well? Fine. Prepare for another test of Bruno. Ready? Motor. Cameraman: Rolling. Director: Action! - He's new, isn't he? - Yes. I've never seen him before. He's not too bad looking. A bit old but won't be much competition. Man: I wanna get this clear between us. Right from the start. I do this for money. Woman: That's what I would have imagined. Man: This, uh, isn't my usual work. I do spots for television. Thing is, things aren't going too well. So I need the money. M-maybe you'll find I'm too expensive. Don't worry. We're not going to argue about money. Naturally, that will allow me to be a bit more demanding now won't it? Hmm, I guarantee you'll be entirely satisfied. Well you see - for someone to be able to do those things. For advertising products commercially... One has to have a body as beautiful and as perfect as mine is. To be attractive and fascinating too! Don't you agree? Woman: Yes, you have a beautiful body. With this torso, put on my shirt, lust! The company's sold out. I cover these legs with a pair of pants and they're a sure sell out! What else can I tell you? Even when I put a pair of gloves on my hands... because I've worn them, they want them. I'm really ideal. The model of perfection! Yes, you're perfect. That's why I chose you rather than one of the others at the hotel. I'm sure of that. I no more saw you then I knew you were a woman of exquisite taste. Parden me. I'm an imbecile. An imbecile who serves only to advertise imbecilic products... For clients more imbecilic who buy them. I don't understand. I don't know. But this all seems so unreal tonight. You. This large house. Why? Because right from the beginning I was sorry we met in that situation, in those circumstances. And I wished you were a different kind of woman. How? I don't know. I... don't know how to say it. I don't want to offend you. No, tell me. Tell me how you, uh, would've like us to have met. Well, for example... blonde, beautiful, young. Pardon me. I already told you I don't want to offend you. You think I'm rude, don't you? We finished. Take him away. Doctor. The director is in his office. He wants to speak with you. Thank you. Police have asked me in the court to aid in clearing up the mystery of the dead youths. And what kind of help can we offer? Well because of the way in which the victims were killed it is suspected that someone connected with medicine or surgery could be guilty. But why? Because it's a precise cut. It couldn't have been done by somebody who didn't have a good knowledge of anatomy. Ah! And the weapon used is a surgical knife. But are you sure? Yes, a simple and inoffensive scalpel. Funny, don't you think? Hmm. And the police have no clues? Nope. So they come to us. But what can we do? Since we have undertaken the first experiments in the recovery of delinquents they think we have a cure for everything. Personally, I don't understand what I could possibly do. It's clear, Dr. Sender. You're a specialist in criminal psychotherapy. You also know the medical profession extremely well. And you're also in a position to judge those who have what we might call, uh, criminal instincts. Uh, it would be interesting if you were to make as detailed a report as possible. Do you understand? When? Tell the chief of police he can count on me. Ah! Also tell him to keep sending his people for the experiments. We're getting good results. - All right. - Well, thanks. Anyway, Ana, it seems to me that the press is giving the case too much coverage. You think so? But of course, the assassin is someone mentally unbalanced. Remember Jack the Ripper of London? They even went so far as to say that he was a doctor. And The Vampire of Dusseldorf... And you really think that with this new treatment of yours the person could become completely normal? I know you don't completely agree with my ideas. But don't doubt it for a moment. I'm sure I can change that man and make him become a useful citizen. You know it's strange. Why does it have to be a man? An assassin? A sadistic homosexual. Why couldn't it be a woman? Hmm? Thanks. I guess you think it's strange I still live here. Yes. The only things this house can offer are bad memories. I'm sorry. Don't worry. I don't like people to get embarrassed when my parents are mentioned. My parents were what was then called very modern. They fell in love with smoking strange herbs and listening to music. In their way they also tried to break with it. With what? With nothing, Victor. They didn't break with anything. They were middle class who played at rebelling against what they themselves represented. My father spent a lifetime looking for an ideology. Something to believe in. But apart from the posters that one hangs on the walls... And the books that one lends friends... He had no choice. He lived a life of compromise from the day he was born. And then one day my grandfather died. He left them this house and a lot of money. And here they languished. Little by little, day by day. And one morning they found them dead. Barbiturates. Not even that was very original. Although it was horrible. I'm sorry, Ana. I shouldn't have started this conversation. Oh Victor, not again. Listen to me, Ana. I'm not looking for any adventure. You're not a pastime with me. It's late, Victor. I'm tired and I have a headache. I'm sorry. Don't be angry. Don't you understand, Ana? I know I could make you happy. I don't believe in makers of happiness. Until tomorrow. I'll see you at the hospital. Hey you, wake up. Where are the others? They've gone somewhere. They're lookin' for a new place. Well why didn't they tell me? I know of a good spot. Well... You see, David, you know you and me have always got on well enough. What's all this about? Well, they say you're peculiar since you had that fight with Mik. They don't trust you. What else? Well, you know. A week ago, the money disappeared. And you were mad. Well, you were mad because of what the boss did to you. Sure! And they think... They think I took the money out of revenge. That's it, isn't it? Yeah. They think you went to the place where we had hid it, and that you took it. What a laugh. If I had wanted revenge... I would've... Broken their heads first. I told them you'd never do a thing like that. That is was part of Bingo's gang. But you know them. You gotta prove it, you know. I don't have to convince 'em about anything. And you can tell them to forget me. From now on I'm gonna have to alone. You gotta take care. They're very dangerous. They don't scare me. Excuse me. Take it easy. Here. Here, boy. Uh... Are you waiting for a friend? No. Are you expecting somebody? I'm not either. Do you come to this club often? Once or twice. I only come here when I feel a bit lonely. - Hey, you live pretty far out, don't you? - We'll be there soon. Sit down. Would you like a drink? No. But I would like to hear some music. Uh, the problem is all I have is a selection of some Strauss waltzes. Waltzes? Well, OK. What was that noise? Didn't you say we were here alone? Must be the dogs. Sometimes they get pretty loud when they play outside the window. I'll put on the music. May I have this dance? It'll be a pleasure. Oh! Now I wouldn't mind something to drink. Well... I guess I'll go. Are you leaving so soon? We've had a good time, no? And what else can you and I do? I imagine there's a lot of things we do beside, uh, dancing a waltz and having a drink. Uh, just a minute. It's just that... When I saw you in that getup and in that club, I imagined that you didn't like men! Well, you made a mistake. I do! In fact, I like them very much. Well, you see, uh, I mean, that is... Look, if you wanna go, you can. I mean, you're under no obligation to stay. When we first met... I told you I only go to that club when... when I feel lonely. If I can't make you forget your loneliness then go on back to the club and find what you need. You know what? You'd be the first woman. You don't have to if you don't feel like it. Sometimes I feel I'd like to be different. Maybe you could help me change. People shouldn't try and change each other. People have a right to be themselves. C'mon. C'mon. Ana: Don't consider yourself completely changed because of this. You'll still be lonely. Could be. And you know why? Because you don't accept yourself the way you are. I don't wanna be like the other kids in that club. Why not? Maybe it's like what you said. I won't accept myself as I am. When I left the Professional Education Center, they gave me a psychoelectronic test. The card that the computer issued to me was marked with the letter "H". It was filled with points that perforated the whole card. That night they televised a launching into space. They talked about the superman of the twentieth century. And I began to start to cry. We are at the exact spot where the latest victim was found. The last couple of hours the police have been thoroughly combing the surrounding area. Reporter: As far as I can see, the police have another problem on their hands. Police man in background: Hey, stop the ambulance for a minute! Reporter: I have been told that they haven't been able to come up with a single clue. Police man in background: We have to make out a report! The victim, a young man like the other three, was named Roman Mendoza. Just turned 18 years old. Brown hair, 5 feet 10 and a half inches, 135 pounds. He was a first year biology student, popular with his classmates, lived with his family on the east side. Now back to our studios. Reporter: Hello, captain. Captain: Good morning. Reporter: Begins to get monotonous, huh? Cameraman: Dick, you're on. With you, once again. I have by my side Captain Brock. Captain, does it seem to you that all these murders were committed by the same person? You think we're seeing the work of the same person, no? I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. As you can see, the police are always willing to cooperate with us. Hey, Captain! Could we take a few shots of the body? Not now. But why? No comment. No comment. You heard and so it goes month after month. Would you be willing to admit before 15 million taxpayers that you haven't been able to come up with one single clue? I have nothing to say! Ah, friends, it seems to me this is going too far. And it's you, all you, who should say something. Evidently the police are failing us. Do you agree? Now back to our main studios! Well, Ok, fat fuck. Cameraman: Take the camera. Bah! Police. I'm surprised these dogs let you pet them. They've very ferocious. When we least expect it, they do something savage and upset my employers. Really? I'll remember that. You take care of the dogs? I'm the maid and it's part of my job. Ah, and the maid is employed by the rich to... Wait at table, clean the house, look after the dogs. A sort of human electro domestic, right? Something like that. What'd you say your name was? Have you forgotten already? Isabelle. I have a bad memory. David. What'd you say? That my name is David. But if you don't like it, I'll change it. What do you do? Do you work around here? Sometimes. I don't like steady jobs. Well on the television they keep talking about being useful to society. And having a specialized job. Really? Do they say that? Huh. How about that television. Listen, I'll tell you a secret. I couldn't care less about being useful to society. Don't talk like that. Someone might hear you. I DON'T CARE IF THEY DO HEAR! DO YOU HEAR ME?! I DON'T WANNA BE USEFUL TO SOCIETY! I WANNA BE USELESS! YES, USELESS! Hey, you know you're very pretty. I'm at home alone today. My employers have gone on a trip. Great. We can keep each other company while we have a drink. I don't know. We don't each other very well. I promise you that if you let me in, you'll get to know me profoundly. I'll put on some music. My employers have some that's very nice. It's old but it's very pretty. I don't like music. Especially if it's old. Just as you like. Shall we go upstairs? What's upstairs? No, don't tell me! Let me guess. Of course. Your bedroom. No. Much better. My employer's bedroom. Well, uh, that'd show a lack of respect. I'll bet the TV doesn't advise one to make love in one's employer's bedroom. Or do they? Don't be silly. Come on, I wanna get to know you profoundly. Come on! What's the matter with you? First... I have a little present for you. You see? You don't have to go upstairs. You have everything you need right here. Music included. If you like, we can dance. I must be honest. That disguise you're wearing is much better than the one you wore the other night. At least you look more... More feminine. It was you who climbed through the window, wasn't it? Yeah. Did you see everything? Not exactly everything. In some ways I am very discreet. Why haven't you told the police? Why are you playing this little game? Well you see... I don't get on very well with the police. Also I really don't care if they catch you or not. However, I do prefer you to be free. I see. You want money, don't you? Not exactly. Let's say... I want a lot of money. How much? I haven't decided yet. But don't worry! You'll be the first to know. I know my own way out. It's still early and I don't wanna spoil your evening. Maybe you'll have better luck with someone else, Ana.

Come on, Nicolas. Hurry up. Director: Dr. Sender, Happy New Year. Thank you, and the same to you, sir. I have news for you from the headquarters of the chief of police. What is it, sir? Boy of nineteen's arrived in the traumatology ward. They say he belonged to a gang of juvenile delinquents. He's full of bruises and swellings. The police think it's due to a disagreement among members of his gang. Well has he said anything? No. He's in no shape to talk. Seems the youngest of the boys suffered from remorse and wanted to talk. He presented himself voluntarily to the police. Any more information on him? No. The police attribute to him criminal act of refined cruelty. Ah, an interesting case, isn't it? With delinquent juveniles it's easy to obtain results. Yes. That's what I think. When the boy recovers he'll be passed to your section. Very well, sir. Don't try to talk. You mustn’t. Calm down. You mustn't move either. Your spine's injured and, for the moment, you're immobile. I know you can hear me perfectly. You know what today is? The 31st of December. The last day. The last day of the year. Are you frightened, David? Don't be frightened. Especially not of me. Don't be afraid. I didn't know you were looking after that patient. I was on duty when he came in. What are you doing here? The director just told me that when the boy recovers he'll be moved to my section. Ana: Why? Victor: You know he's a delinquent... And we're going to experiment with him, Ana. What's wrong with you? Why are you looking like that? You can't. You can't experiment with him. I don't understand. Do you know anything about it? No, no, no. You mustn't. But, why not? Don't you realize? He's only a child! He can't be a d- criminal! How naive you are! Do you know how many crimes were committed last year by boys like him? By children, as you say? Seven thousand! And among those crimes were dozens of murders! Yes, I know but... And besides, when they're young recuperation is much easier. Do you have fifteen minutes? Yes. Why? I want you to see the results that we're obtaining. Come. Don't worry, they can't see us. The other side of the glass is opaque. I don't understand. Who are those men and what are they doing? Until recently, they were dangerous criminals. They've beem rehabilitated with electric shock. We've prepared this dinner for them tonight so they can celebrate the New Year. Let's hear what they're saying. “It's a model, 20 square meters only, with an incorporated television screen." "And it also has the rights to 5 meters of land for parking." "And does it have an electric comfort g-" Yes. Yes, I understand. You wanna talk. I'm sorry you can't. I'd love to hear you. Hear what you're thinking. You think I killed those boys just for the joy of killing. But no, David, I didn't. Honestly. They were happy with me. They probably spent the only moments which justified their entire lives. The surgical knife reached their hearts smoothly. Without any pain. It was like a last caress. Before I met you, an old man told me something, just before he died. He said that the whole world was just a place full of dead people. It was a lovely idea. Although it wasn't his. He read it in some book. So you see, David, they were dead. Yes, they were all dead before I killed them. You see? You were always different from the others. But now you'll never be the way you were. They plan to change you. Make you suffer in a cold, calculated scientific way. Filling your head with electric discharges. They'll kill you with life. A false way of life made to their way of thinking, to their standards. Don't close your eyes! You may think this is silly but... I've just remembered a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. I don't remember all the words, but, they were very beautiful. “Silent and distant, your look pursues me." "Like two fixed stars..." “Like two sad stars." "Like two white stars." Doorman: Good evening, Dr. Sender. Is there an emergency? Dr. Sender: No, nothing important. Nicoli, tonight I promised to have a drink with one of the nurses to celebrate the New Year. Well, drop by and see us later. Thanks. Good evening. Where's the duty nurse? - Who, Ana? - Yes. Well she passed along here with a patient. She told me she had orders to transfer the patient to your sector. Are you sure? Yes, she went to the 4th floor. Precisely to your sector, Dr. Sender. Happy New Year, Victor. Ana... What have you done? Can't you see? I'VE JUST KILLED A MAN!
