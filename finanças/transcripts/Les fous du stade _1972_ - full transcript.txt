Do you know them? Thank you very much. - You can go pay, bye. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. - A poem? - It's my list. - For me? Yes. Today I woke up dreaming with your toes. I would like to take 5 kilos of potatoes. It's beautiful. I would grant you a wish, if you let me take some fish. I love you so much... Listen to my request, and let me take those green peas, I can not touch. - Those? - Yes, those. - Up there? - Yes. - And milk powder. - Up there? - Yes. Go to the cash register. No madam, I changed my mind. I take these biscuits instead. - There you are. - Thank you. " NO POTABLE WATER" All this for only 12,45? Excuse me, this is not right. - Tuna 3,50. - Here says 3,10. 3,50 with tax. - This, 10 francs. - But that's mine. 12 francs. Jesus, right in his head. Gil, that's terrible. The boy can't move. Come help. My shirt! The cow is eating my shirt. Get out of here. My pants! - Phil, Jean. - What is it? - Get wood for the fire. Take it easy, ok! - Let's go that way? - No, that way. Ah, perfect.

Smells good. - What did you do? - What is it? - Well, it was what I found ... Throw it out. Now, it's time, for the game, "man on fire". To the participant today, we will have a question... that has to be answered before the passing of the torch. Mr. Albert, who won the 100 meters at the 1936 Olympic Games? Quickly, the torch is approaching fast. Yes, just a few meters away. Very close. It's here! - Fire! - Fire! And now what we eat. - Hello there - The Fougasse. I'm going there. Be careful. BE CAREFUL! - Be careful - I can not look. - Go, give him a hand. - No, wait, he's getting here. - Well, did you like it? - Great! Of course, not canned food. How much will it cost us? I was thinking of a deal. Look guys, I'll be straight. - Do you have light? - Yes. My son, Lucien, is hurt. He has a wound in the head and can not work. And all the young boys in the village are on vacation. So, there is nobody to decorate the village. - The torch will pass through in 2 days. - Really? And being young as you are, and with a vein for the arts... I thought that maybe you could help. Sure, but we are here on holidays... Wait, it's only 2 days But it's less 2 days of holidays. I'll tell my daughter Delis, to grant the decorations to you. Well, this will be more interesting. Sure, sure… -Do you agree? -We do. - The decorations to be little fancy, ok. - What do you mean, little fancy? Something everyone will understand... Stop. Pass me the hammer. One, two, three. One, two, three. I think it does not work. - What do you do there? - I was down there, and suddenly up here. Doctor... Doctor... - How to I cut? - Very thin. - Ok, very thin. Guys, enough with flags. Now, raise the mast. And then, go get the statue. Watch out, it's very fragile. You must be very careful. Hey, Phil, come. Goodbye Lucien. Goodbye, Doctor. Doctor! Be still, you're always moving. I can never finish like that. - Hello, is it finished? - You are already here? - Not yet. - No? - No. - Can we help you? - Sure, get the tools. There is little left to do. Hold it a bit higher. That's good. Good finishings. Good. The neck needs a bit more work. Bravo! Now is good. Unbelievable. Are you cold? Guys, now is perfect. - Great, what do you think? - Excellent. Can I do something else? - Good-bye. - Thank you. - Be careful. Wait. Can I do something else? - Give me that. - Hey! - What did you do? - Why didn't you hold it? - What do we do now? - We can glue it! - Lucien, wait. - Do you have glue? Yes, here. - Too small. - Do you have more? - Bigger? - Yes, here. - Ah, that's better. What do you think? - Well, it's done. - Bravo! - Something is missing there. - I guess so. Come with me. Ready, 1...2...3. - Keep going, keep going. - My FOOT! - Yes, it looks nice. - Beautiful. Yes, and is not modern. Any one will understand... What are you doing? - It bowed down. What bowed down? Agachou-se. - O que se agachou? Good morning. - Daddy, wait for me. - Good work, guys. It's a bit different from the picture. - Artist's skills... - But it is not bad... - The main thing is not modern. - So, you like it? Yes, I identify myself with it. - My friends, let's go for a drink. - So kind. No, you go to the shop. Go. Tomato, mastic, cinzano, mint, artichok. - Is this your drink? - Yes, it has some alcohol. Guys, I would like to ask you a small favour. Tomorrow the President will come to inaugurate a statue. Trumpets, fanfares, some music, would be good. - You are musicians, no? - Yes, we are. - We have a POP band. - Wonderful. - And the instruments? - And the uniforms? - In the dressing room, choose what you like. - Good morning. - Nice to meet you. 1,2,3. - Good, very good. - The other way!

Finally. - Saboteurs! - Did it on purpose? No! Turn it, right away. Bravo. - Do not be silly. - Tomorrow, you will not remember her. - Forget her. - You're a grown up behaving like a fool! Look, they're cute. - Guys, are you ready? - For what? It's a festive day and nobody should miss it. Hurry up, otherwise you miss the best of it! - I'm not going. - Shut up and come! Very well.

Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Where is the nearest tree? - There. - Gerard. - Gerard, wait. I am Jean, do you remember me? Are you playing Tarzan? - Don't take it too serious. - I wanted to die. - We don't do things this way. - You know something? Let's shave and get changed. These morons, have not heart. Hey, hey, relax. Mr. Fougasse. Mr. Fougasse. It's 3 p.m.. Speak up boy, what's the matter?

Dear daddy, don't be upset with me, but he's so cute,... ... that I ran away with him. Kisses, loving sports. Your little angel, Delis. Lucien! What is it? - Hurry up. - Where do we go? - We're going to get your sister. Alright. Where are we going? This is not the way to the village. - We're going to see the athletes. - I don't want to see the athletes. I want to see Delis. - Exactly, follow us. Officer, which way to the city? You can't miss it. Keep always straight ahead. Always straight ahead. - What do we do now? - He said always straight ahead. - Take it out! - Let's move. Straight ahead. Straight ahead. Sorry, he said straight ahead! He didn't say in a straight line? Who said that? I didn't hear that. He didn't mean a straight line, right? Let's go back. I have no wings! You're nuts. - You're very kind. - Thanks for the ride. Good bye. I'm tired of walking. When someone come, let's stop him. - Can we get a ride? - What's the problem?

Keep watching. Here's the bill, 10 francs. Thank you. Good,hey? I'm making foam. Beer without foam is the same as coffee without sugar. - Who is paying? - Me. - 6 francs, please. Do you have change? - I only have 500. - Sure, sure, I'll be back. - We'll get with the athletes. - That's a waste of time... - Shut up and eat. - Guys, I have a plan.

He hasn't been feeling good... - He has a sore throat? - Yes, no... - Something different. - A broken heart? - Yes. - Because of me? - Yes. Ah, but that's not too serious, I'm a free girl. He'll get over it. Did you all come? - Yes, we all came. - Serious? - Yes. Then, tell them I'm sending a kiss to all. Daddy, are you seeing? I tought she was with the athlete. If I catch him, I'll smash him. Lucien, help me.. - Yes, I'll help you. - Let's go, let's go. - You moron, playing games with my daughter! - Me no. - Give me, my daughter back! - I don't know where she is. Came here, you scoundrel - Go son, get him! - Ok. You wanted to play. Let's see if you're a man, now. Catch him! I saw Delis. Her father and brother are coming after me! And the others are coming too. But these are not my guys! Where are my cyclists? Hey! Jean, faster, go. Faster. Not so fast, otherwise you won't get to the finish line. What are you drinking? You can't drink during the race. Faster, the police is chasing us. Dear listeners, it's fantastic. I can see our national team. I shoul say that... Yes, there're coming alone. And for the first time... ...in this games they will share the medals! They are arriving, they are the strongest. They'll receive the gold medal. Congratulations to the national team. My friends, I have great news for you: our national team has just won the first medal. Our first gold medal! But there is more to win. I believe in you, guys! As the baron Pierre de Coubertin would say. Doesn't matter, a medal is a medal. But Sir, there was a swapping! The ones that started are not the ones that arrived! - Are they amateurs? - Surely, yes. - Bring them to me and tell no one. - Sure, as you wish. - Medals, finally medals. - Not accredited, they have no licences. Take the licences! - Now, they have. - They are amateurs. You never made money in sports? - I never made money with anything. - You may not be the first. - And now, quickly to the podium. - What? They only need a bit of discipline. They are very talented. We are here to find Delis. Quickly, take them. Quickly! They won. - Here are the medals. - Thank you. Good, hey? You guys can win any medal. You are very talented. We never played sports. You did more than 55km in a bicycle. - The time proves it. - This was because we had a great warm-up. - So do you stay or not? - No! - All for the track now! Give me back my daughther! - Save us! - We'll do what you want. Start. What is this? Hey, let me go. To the floor. But Sir, alone I can not win medals. The tv viewers want medals? You are the first? They want another one. This is an order. Otherwise I'll be fired? Very well, I'll do my best. - Here are the tests. - Have you seen our champions. They're not good, but it doesn't matter. Those four are the worst. - Where do I put them? - Put them in some games. The important is participation. Ready. Ready. Switch your place. Here, and you there. Attention. Ready. To your places. Ready. What are you doing? It wasn't me. - Which one? - This one. There it is. To your places. Attention. There. Give me that. - Look. - Is it yours? - No, it was there. - It means they're around here. - Great guess, my dear Watson. - What? - Nothing. Come Daddy. Come close. Fight by the rules. No dirty tricks. And use Fair Play, ok? - What's the problem? - I have no shorts. - What? - I have no shorts. You come to fight and forget the shorts! Stay there, idiot. I'll be back. Ready? Start. Bite his fingers. Get in position! Don't be afraid. One ticket, thanks. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 8, 9 1, 2, 3, 4 5, 6, 7 That's ilegal. That's... - 1, 2,..., - 4, 5, faster! 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! I announce the winner. The winner is Phil. Victory! He's our friend. And continuing our transmission of the International Games. The athletes are prepared to throw the dart. That's the second try. Good throw. Dear sporting fans, with this throw... ... our athlete gets ahead. - Not true. - He deserves the gold medal. - He's irregular. Our athlete is ready for the third throw. He's the best. - He does everything within the rules. - I don't believe on him. He's getting ready to throw. Attention, he has thrown it. - It's a new record! - He lost! - That's cheating! -This is a new record, new record! Look. - You could also have this kind... - We would have more to sell. That's just a piece of iron! Let's go, morons! - Take it easy. - You look like the seargent. - Stand up , quickly. - We're not in the army, anymore. Ready? An athlete has fallen, maybe he's too tired. - No, they hit him with the stick. - Good. You can't do that! Quickly Phil. Go, more... That's cheating. This one? Thank you. They can not win. Can you see the publicity? It is everywhere. It can't be... Up to now, you're doing great, but the worst is yet to come. - The marathon. - What is the marathon? - It's a long race of 42km. - By bycicle? 42km running. I'll put you in such shape that you'll even fly. - This way I won't run much. - What did you do to my daughter? - What? - Where's my daughter? I want my daughter. Give her to me right away or something awful will happen. I warned you. Let me go. - Truly, what is the problem? - I want my daughter. What does our champions have to do with that? In reality, we came here to look for her... - because of Gerard. - For me? - Did you hear them? - After the marathon we'll discuss that. - Where is your daughter? - I don't know. - She is with the athlete. The blue eyes athlete. Dear miss, thanks to you... ... the feelings... ... you transmit to our athletes... That's us. Our team has won... ... a great number of medals... ... that makes our country very happy. What are you talking about, I haven't understood anything? Well, we only have half hour left before the marathon starts. The result of this event... ... will alter our International classification. If our athletes are driven by love... in sports,... ... I think...I believe, ... we can win this last medal. - My daughter will not be the "bait". - The "bait"? - Yes, like the one I use to fishing. - Miss... ... our team's fate is in your hands. Well, I agree. You agree, with what? Who wins the marathon, wins my heart. I want to say something. Sir. after we win, everything will be like before. Let's go to the marathon. The marathon starts in half hour. We trust in you. Don't disappoint us. Runners, please, get ready for the start. Very well. Sir, I don't see our team. - Ah, there! - This is the place to attack. - Yes, I will attack very early. - Do you have a bycicle? - Yes. Can you follow us? - Yes. - Come behind us... ... and you help us as we need. - 42 km? - Won't you do that for Gerard? - Publicity? - No. Coca-Cola.

You are 20 minutes behind. Stop. - Excedeu o limite de velocidade. - Vou passar a multa. Gerard. Gerard! Help, help! - What is it? - Gerard fell inside. - Fast! Gerard run. - Go! We have to save energy. You can't understand? Are you a foreigner? - E o Gerard? - He knows - They're coming. A few kilometres from the finish line we have 2 atlhetes leading. Number 105, and number 196. - Daddy, they are the first two. - And if they arrive ex aequo? Let's move, let's move. Attention, now! He won't go too far. Where are you going? Gerard, are you ok? - What happened? - He got hurt. I know what to do. Put this on. What are you doing? You look like Jesus Christ, The Redeemer. Quickly, dry him. - Be careful. - Sorry, I didn't mean it. You didn't mean it, but I am the one burning! Straight ahead. Go, go! - A little more, go. - For who? I don't know. Let's go, move! Fast!
