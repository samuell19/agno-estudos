And we continue listening to good music, and almost reaching the end of our program we have Dr. Maximiliano Espósito with us who has just released his new book "Tribal Education." Explain to us briefly Maxi, what the book is about? Well, the book is an investigation that took me many years. I am a psychiatrist and I work mostly with boys and teenagers who have the particularity that they grew up or are growing up in orphanages or reformatories. Therefore they are not raised in traditional families and studying the subject, I found that when they grow up in these groups without the model of a "normal" family. Other codes are established, there are other traditions, and there are other rites that shape their minds in another way, as happens for example in tribes or clans. The subject also comes from your own life experience, right? Yes, I became an orphan when I was a kid, and I lived all my childhood and adolescence in foster care. It was a house in the countryside where many boys lived. Well, Maxi, thank you so much for coming, this is the end of the program for today…. SEVEN ARRESTED FOR THE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF WOMEN IN SUBURBAN WHOREHOUSES VOICEMAIL Hi, Maxi, I'm Héctor, Héctor from Totorales. Well, many years have passed…. I would have liked to talk to you. I was calling you all morning but it was useless. I'm not calling you with good news. Dad is dead, Maxi. Dad died. I don't know if you're interested in coming, I had to let you know, right? I'm calling everyone. We will have to start with the inheritance. There are the fields, the house, it's sort of a mess. I believe that dad left you something. Well, I did my part in letting you know. If you want, you can come. We can have a look at this last will issue so you can say goodbye. We are here, always. Bye. Waitress! A wine, please. IMPLANT AND ORTHODONTIC SPECIALISTS MORATORIUM LOAN GRANTED INTEREST DEBT PAYMENT INTIMATION 72 HOURS PERIOD DULY NOTIFIED Hello? Good morning, we are calling from the Continental Bank Are you Maximiliano Espósito? Yes. Mr. Espósito, the reason for this call is for the fulfillment of your obligations with the Continental Bank, regarding the credit that we granted you…. ESPOSITO SLAUGHTERHOUSE Shit! TOTORALES FUNERAL HOME She was such a good person! A saint has departed! She died alone, poor thing! María! Oh, dear María! Dear, María! THE MORNING DIRECTOR: JUAN MANUEL ESPOSITO Hello. Is someone there? -Maxi…. -Héctor. I can’t believe it, you came! -How are you? -How are you? How was your trip? It went well. Maxi, how long has it been since you last came? I don’t know, like ten, fifteen years. How did you get my telephone number? No, it has been twenty-five years since you left. Have you seen anyone else? Have you just arrived? Yes, I just arrived, a little while ago. First, I passed by the wake house, I thought that maybe you were there. Look, what happened to dad took all of us by surprise. Well, but he was very overweight. Have you had the wake yet? No, not yet. We still have to do some paperwork. But it's…. all on track. We were waiting for you, Maxi. The truth is that I came for a short time, I can’t stay long. But you just arrived and you already want to go? Not now, but I can’t stay long. You were talking to me about the inheritance, with whom should I talk about this? Well, you only came for that? Sebastián is handling the paperwork. Why don’t we go to my office? You can talk directly with him he can explain everything about the paperwork and also about the wake. What do you think? You can estimate there is around 4,000 head of cattle and we have only twenty-five employees. What was the name of the manager? -Bacigalupo. -Bacigalupo. But he died a long time ago. Here, the one that took over was me. The others got on with their lives. I was the only one that stayed on the farm with dad. But the farm made the money for everyone’s studies, trips, rent, and parties. And the others know about the inheritance? The others know it very well. Dad and I put in a lot of time and effort in this…. and everything works well, too…. but dad's will is that we all talk about it. To stay calm and discuss everything. For me, the important thing is that you came, you can say goodbye to dad, and we can finally finish with everything that was left half done. What was left half done? Oh, I can’t believe this. Motherfucker, and on top of that he plays dumb. How many times do I have to say to you that you can’t do that here? Go away! Go away! Go home! Don’t even think about coming here tomorrow! Can you believe it? You have to be on top of everything! Okay, people are arriving. What’s up? Look who I brought. Maxi! It’s so nice to see you! Juanma! Hey, I saw you in the La Mañana newspaper, you are the editor-in-chief! You’re always so perceptive. It’s your fault, you always gave me everything you read. You got me interested in it. I started writing and fell into the vice… the profession! Juan, did you bring me Benitez’s thing? Did you bring it? Yes, I left it in dad’s office. Why don’t you leave it on my desk, in my office? Have you seen the house? Yes, I’ve been looking downstairs. Okay, come with me and I’ll give you the tour upstairs. Okay, let’s go. Do you know? Recently, I discovered a secret, a Polish writer, living here in Argentina, about one hundred years ago who wrote wonderful articles, and he wrote a novel called “Nightmare”. Juancito, it wouldn’t hurt to sweep here every once in a while, right? It’s hard to get, but I can send you a book. Yes, please. It’s great, it’s wonderful. There hasn’t been any light in here for a while. Dad was living alone these last few years and let himself go. Here is dad, Maxi. Poor dad. Poor him. Why did you leave? Why did you leave, dad? This way Maxi, come here. Over here, over here. I’m sorry, we should have told you. Maxi, calm down. Maxi, Maxi, calm down, calm down. This struck very hard for all of us. Calm down, try to breathe. Breathe, breathe. It’s all going to be okay, calm down. I can’t understand why you keep Aldo like this. He must be buried. What you are doing, it’s not normal. Do you realize that? It’s not the time yet. Some things need to resolve. Dad is okay with that. How is he okay? Hector, what are you saying? What needs to be resolved? What does that have to do with being able to…. bury him? Juanma are you okay with what is happening? Because it’s not okay. Maxi look, this hurts all of us, it’s complicated. We must be organized. We must do things like dad wants. He must be a part of this, he has to see that we respect his will. Maxi, look at me. Be calm, everything is going to be okay. There’s no problem. Don’t ask me to be calm. It’s horrifying what you are doing. I don’t know if you realize that. I can’t let this continue. Have you reported his death, at least? I’m going to the police. Wait a minute, Wait a minute…. you’re blind. Try to understand our point of view. You’re thinking this the wrong way. Try to understand. Hector, what do you want me to understand? That you went crazy? Please, let me go. What do you want, to go to the police? Do you want to go to the police? We will go with you. Okay, we are already here. The three of us. At the door of the police station. What? I don't care about your dessert, come here! We will wait for you inside. Here comes the sheriff. You’re messing around again? How are you, guys? It’s been a long time since you last visited me. What are you laughing about, dude? We have been waiting for you for half an hour. You can come at anytime, don’t worry…. I came as fast as I could, I’m here now, right? Hello. How are you, Maximiliano Espósito? Don’t you know me? Oh, yes. Oscar. Hey, am I so different? Look when you came back… It’s been a long time. Well…. We were talking…. I explained to him the situation with dad. But it seems there are doubts about how to continue. This is a delicate matter, it’s going to take some time. I can solve this as the sheriff but the family comes first. We have to do things as we do them. You understand what I’m saying, right? No, actually, I don't understand. Dad is fine where he is. He is at his house. He is not in danger, nothing will happen to him there. We will solve this among us when the time is right. And then we will deal with dad. I’m sorry, but I don’t think it’s okay to leave him just lying there. It’s a serious situation, right? The normal thing to do is to take him to the morgue, or a cold store…. We don’t have a morgue here. We merely have something to write. Look at the junk I have as a computer. What I mean is that maybe there is something we can do, that is what I mean. Yes…. to wait. I don’t think it will take much longer. SECURITY POLICE Maxi! Hey, Maxi! You’re tired, right? Yes, a little bit. Do you want me to take you to the house? You can rest for a while, or if you want, you can stay the night. -To the house? -Yes. No, I don’t want to go there for now. You can come home for as long as you want! There's a guest room as well. Oh, if so you can stay in mine too, there is no problem. Thank you, now I need to be alone if it’s okay with you. Whatever you need. I’m going to walk around town. Okay. Maxi, in times like these I need to search for spiritual guidance. Some comfort. Are you still going to church? No. Well, think about it. When you are ready, I’ll wait for you at home. Okay. I live next door to the Monzú’s, do you remember? The Monzú, yes. My house has black iron gates. You can come at any time, it’s okay if you come late. I’ll be up. Any time. Thank you. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. Javier…. I’m a little surprised, nothing else. Finally! Come. So, you followed the priesthood path. Well…. yes, it’s logical. This was always my house since we were kids. How kind of you to come! Yes, Héctor called me a few days ago. I arrived and have been catching up with the situation. I don’t know if you know…. Yes, poor dad. It took us all by surprise. Oh, so you do know? That he is still in the house. Do you know that? Sometimes things don’t go as you wish, Maximiliano. Death is not an easy thing. Yes, but this situation isn’t normal. I don’t know what Héctor is thinking but it’s not okay. There is a reason to have a wake for the dead, to bury them. You must know it better than anyone, rituals are not a whim. And that is why I’m telling you that death is not an easy thing. Let alone in a case like a dad’s…. because dad was not an ordinary father. Aldo Ventura was a patriarch. And for a patriarch’s favorite son like Héctor, the grief will be a pain that will be with him until the last day. And that is something we will need to respect. I understand what you mean, but I don’t agree. At this moment, our father is sitting in a chair, rotting. Do you think that that is okay? God doesn’t close a door without opening a window. You must learn from the pain. That you realize that you have a chance to heal your soul’s wounds. To heal the wounds in your heart for leaving your father and his mission. I didn’t leave anybody. I have to apologize to you because I committed the sin of injustice. You were also a favorite son. You’re the other favorite son. And, it's normal that you couldn’t solve the things in your past. Dad…. was a man that worried and did a lot so we could have a home, so we can live abundantly. That is why you see us like this, close to each other, the ones that stayed. And maybe, if you hadn’t left, today, all of these situations may have run a normal course. I didn’t leave anybody. Maximiliano, dad worked harder for your education than for any of us. And when you had a chance, you turned your back on the man that gave you a home, who raised you as his own. You left him heartbroken. You were always his favorite. And one day you were gone and left him a void without even an explanation. Anyway, he'd talked to us about you and told us you were going to come back. And you know what? He was right because you are here. What I think is that nobody can decide on the future of another person, not even your father. Dad was at your side to guide you, so don’t stumble, don’t deviate. I don’t know, maybe. Maxi, life, it’s not an easy thing, but neither is death. Maxi? Maxi, is that you? Anita…. Hi. It’s so nice to see you! Were you passing by? No, no. I just came out of school. I’m a teacher, can’t you tell? Yes, I noticed. It’s so weird to see you here after so long. When did you arrive? Yesterday. And why did you come back? Because Aldo died, my dad. A few days ago. Didn’t you know? No, how would I know? The Espósitos are closed. I’m so sorry, how are you? So-so. The truth is that this is something very faraway for me. I came because I need to do some paperwork. You didn't visit before? No. I assumed you were in Buenos Aires, but I never heard anything about you. -Okay. -Yeah. What happened to you? Will you ever tell me? It’s been so long that I don’t know if I wanted to explain. I don’t know what to say. Yes, it is true, it’s been forever since we were children. I can tell that it wasn’t so bad for you. I can’t complain…. Do you have some time? I would love to know about you. Now? Yes, I have some time. -Have you eaten? -No. Do you want to go to my house? I can make you something delicious. Okay, yes! Come on! That way? -This is crazy, right? -Yes…. I’m all yours! Please, stay. Don’t leave…. Maxi? Do you know that if you come here to live, you could be the hospital director? You have a trajectory no one else has, you’re better than anyone. Do you think so? I have a lot of commitments in Buenos Aires. We are struggling with…. the college group…. Here, you could be the secretary of health. You were always so good with people. You could even have your study group, make agreements, whatever you want. What can I say? That sounds nice. Come on, don’t be mean. Stay. You can stay at my house as long as you want. And when you collect your inheritance, you can spend it with me. Are you going to miss all that? Come on. Hey, how is everybody? Maxi, it’s so nice to see you! Dieguito! How are you? How are you doing? It’s so nice to see you! Very nice! You look the same. You look the same! Oh, please, I have grey hair! I missed you, I mean it. I don’t know the rest, but I missed you. Thanks. Dieguito, why don’t you stop bugging the associates with the raffles, focus a little, and put together a good team because they are beating the crap out of us every Saturday? Diego is the President of the Juventud Unida, you must see how he maintains the club. Oh, congratulations! President…. It was a joke. Dude, it was a joke. What? Are you sensitive? I think I’ve already told this one. Once the old man tells me, “You are going to kill a pig.” He put me in the truck, and took me to the pigpen that was behind Fernandez’s post. He gave me a knife, got me into the pigpen, and I started, of course, running towards the pigs to kill one of them. At some point I slipped, I went to hell, I fell in the pigpen. And the old man looks at me and says, "If you don’t bring a dead pig you can’t enter the house.” Tough old man! Do you remember when he took us by force to Canullán’s brothel? What a son of a bitch! Yes, I remember that it was just before I entered the police academy. He forced me to get naked, handcuffed me to the bed, and called the Paraguayan girl, do you remember the Paraguayan? And he tells me, “You must learn from now because this is what you are going to do everyday.” And he didn’t leave until I was hard and started fucking! What a son of a bitch! Want to play? Thank you, I don’t play Chess anymore. Come on, while the food goes down. No, really, I haven’t played in a long time, I must be rusty. Thank you, but no. What are you saying, that you forgot how the pieces move? Don’t be a chicken! It’s only for a short time. Do you know how I learned to play this? One afternoon in the slaughterhouse, came a big group of Aberdeen Angus, that are black, you know? And the slaughterers, the guys, are all dressed in white. They sent them one by one, pim, pim, pim and they killed them. Then I said, “At work, I play Chessboard every day, how can I not learn how to play? So, I learnt. But…. I always play with the white pieces, they are the ones that work for me. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Good, Maxi, great! It’s yours, Maxi, finish it! Maxi! Maxi! Shit! Calm down! Maxi, calm down! Hey… I changed the sheets earlier today, and there was nothing! In the bathroom? No, there’s nothing! I didn’t see anything! Wait, wait, chill. You’re not thinking straight. Calm down. We were together yesterday and you didn’t take anything. Think, when was the last time you took them? Yes, I know. Slow down, Maxi. Stop and think. I’m here for whatever you need. Thank you. Thank you very much. I left the medication in the room upstairs. Do you want to go with me? You go and do what you have to do. But I’ll stay as long as you need, okay? You’ll be fine, go. At this point in my life, guarding as if I were a patrol officer. But for you, we do whatever is needed. We miss you so much. Who’s there? It’s me, Maxi. So, you came back. I thought you left again. Thank goodness. Show your face! Show! What are you doing here? I forgot something the other day and came looking for it. You? What are you doing here? I explained this to you at the police station. Hurrying up the paperwork. Are you going to take him? Not yet. We’ll see. And when are we going to bury him? We’re almost there, aren't we? Sadistic, son of a bitch. You ruined my life, you fucked all of us. What more do you want? You can’t be here anymore. I’ll bury you, dad. What are you doing? What’s your name? Tell this man what is your name. Lucía…. She arrived yesterday from Misiones. Brand new. And how should I know she is brand new? That no one touched her? Easy, Tito, it’s all checked out. Tell this man how old you are. Eighteen…. Of course, when they’re fifteen, they’re eighteen. And when they’re twenty-five, they are also eighteen! Hello. Yes…. Is everything ready? Is it all arranged? Okay. I’ll be there shortly. Let's go. Hey. Hey! Hey! Wake up. Maxi. Hey, Maxi. Today is the day. Not everybody is here, but we’re enough. Today we define inheritance. Dad…. Dad must decide who will continue all of this. Do you remember now? Do you remember now, Maxi, what we used to do here? Maxi, it’s this and then we are almost done. Today it will be defined. We’re all grown up…. Someday it was going to be our turn, right? This is a family issue, and we need to solve it among ourselves. There are a lot of ways to do it, but it has to be done between you and me. And if you don’t want to, I and the guys will agree to make a clean break. And we will feel sorry for dad. Héctor, you’re crazy! We’re all crazy. So, let’s finish this. Yes or no? Dad, we’re almost ready. My sons! This moon is tying the fate that walked far for so many years. You will feel the whip on the back to stop, and choose the path to take. My little orphans, I went back in time, to flay the ox and the seedless bull! To hold you in the comfort of my love…. Dad, it’s so nice that you are here. No, dad, I’m Héctor. Dad, I’m your favorite. I fulfilled everything. Maxi is the traitor! Maxi left you. I’m your Tito, dad! I’m your beloved Tito. As you wish, dad. You decided. Thanks for choosing me. It’s so nice to be with you. I love you so much. The wild horse doesn't get tamed, the savage one doesn't get settled the ring is not taken if the horse bucks. After the first there is no prize, there is only slaughter! The blood is drunk and it gives power. The lineage is absorbed and never gets lost. My boys, my orphans. Long live the Espósitos! Long live the Espósitos! Okay, thank you very much, guys. It’s beautiful. It seems like another house. Yes. Okay, kids, we’re here! Come on, come on, it’s this way. Now we’re going to see the house and going to say hi to Maximiliano, he will take care of you. He is my brother, so from now on, I’ll be your uncle. Hey, you’re here! Welcome, what a joy! You’re going to have a lot of fun here, and there is room for everybody. Tomás! Come here, Tomás, my love. Don't separate yourself from the rest because you may get lost. The house is very big, and we’re going to see all of it.
