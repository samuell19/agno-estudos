I was all alone at the edge of a big canyon, and I was fighting against Simba and his friends. I was greatly outnumbered, but I felt invincible. They were trying everything they could think of to beat me. But nothing worked. And the best part was the way Simba was shaking. He was so afraid that he surrendered and handed over his throne to me. Of course, you handed the throne to me. (laughing) Of course. Stop cackling like that. I gave you an order. You did? Oh. Now go assemble our forces. I can't wait to see Simba's face when he surrenders. (laughing) I want some volunteers to make Simba come out of there. I don't think you'll get any, master. I have to do everything myself.

No please, I'd rather forget all about this place. (laughing) What do we do now, master? Hmm? We'll go around the valley, and we'll wait. If Simba and his friends come out of there alive, I'll make sure they never get away again. Think anyone could make it through, master? Those monsters look like they'll eat anything. Hopefully they won't. Why is that? Simba is mine! I want the pleasure of getting rid of him myself. Well, if everything keeps going this smoothly, we'll be home in no time. We'll be fine. We have Simba's magic cape. (laughing) And we have Simba to guide us, Baloo. Of course, it's good that all of us are working together to help him. Still, I'll be glad to get back to our forest. And dinner. Who knows how far home is though? We might have to spend the night. If that's the case, we'll have to count on our strength and our patience to get us through. Augustine's right.

But I still don't see any treasure. Me neither, and I'm starting to have my doubts. Doubt no more. Whoa! A stairway. A secret passage. The treasure is down below, sirs, waiting for you. Shall we? ♪ Keep going, XL. Yeah. This way, sirs. Oh! You've got the key to that door, right? Of course, sir, I've been guarding it for 3,000 years. Whoa. ♪ This is it, XL, the moment we've been waiting for. We should've brought bags. Hey, Thin, look! What, what is it? That's us! And we look really good, don't you think? Yeah, we look so adventurous. You see? We've been waiting. It was written that someday you would come. So that picture's 3,000 years old? You see, we're holding treasure. As I told you before, my master was a prophet. He knew you were destined to come here. We know everything about you, from the day you were born to right now. And the treasure? Yeah, hand it over already. It's not mine to give you. Only when we have irrefutable proof that you really are XL and Thin and not a couple of imposters will the treasure be yours. You don't believe we're really who we are? It's not my place to judge. Who else could we be then? My master, the great Ratses II, devised a fool-proof method to determine whether or not you are Thin and XL. This device you see here is absolutely precise. It was created especially for this occasion. -Looks like fun. -Don't touch it. Why not, didn't you say this was designed for us? It's not a toy, it's a crystal scale that's used to determine if you're entitled to the treasure. Once you climb onto it, your weight will be measured to the exact gram. If it corresponds to the weight predicted by Ratses II, then the doors to the treasure room will open. Oh. ♪ Huh? To the nearest gram? I just had that corn. If you should fail the test, that is, if you don't weigh the exact amount-- What will happen? You will be punished for having dared to desecrate the sacred ground of Ratses II. -Punished? -Don't worry. -Ratses II was never wrong. -What if he was? Then you'll suffer terrible consequences. However, if you are Thin and XL, the wandering pirates, you have absolutely nothing to fear. Let's look at that picture again. I was afraid of that, whoever did this made me too thin, Ratses is wrong, and I'm gonna pay. How dare you even doubt the almighty Ratses II! Anyone who insults the master will suffer a terrible fate! (roar) Your stomach's always getting us into trouble, XL. -Thanks a lot. -Enough of this. It's time to get on the scale. Forget it, no treasure's worth this. You can take us to the exit now. I order you to get on that crystal scale. Calm down, calm down! I'm starting to think you really are imposters! ♪ This is all your fault, XL. Look at those spears! Oh, no! It's just your imagination. ♪ The door, look, Thin, it's opening! The treasure's ours! Whoo-hoo! We're rich! Rich! Whoa, it's ours! We did it, buddy! Yoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Wee! We're rich! ♪ ♪ I can't believe it. Nor can I, after 3,000 years, I'm finally free! However, I have one more task, and that is to take you to Ratses II. Why do we have to see him? The Royal Highness' desire to give you one more treasure in person. -Right this way, please. -Where? Through the time tunnel. Time tunnel? And all this, we'll come back to get it, right? We're keeping it. The treasure's all yours, but you better hurry. This door's going to close. Come on, XL. Here goes nothing. ♪ Look! Wow! Where are we? It's so fancy. ♪ Whoa! ♪ Must be paradise! Did you see all that food? Gentleman, I must inform you that no one in this palace can see or hear either of you. You don't exist for them. -What did we do? -Nothing. That's just the way it is when you travel in time. Only those with special powers can see us. And only Ratses II and Queen Cheddarisis have those powers. Now come along. ♪ They're so serious. I'm getting scared again, Thin. ♪ Here we are. ♪ I can't believe we're seeing this, XL. The King of Egypt! Wait till we tell our friends we met the ancient pharaoh! Silence, please. Show some respect. ♪ Oh Great All-Knowing Majesties, your humble servant salutes you. These are the pirate rats who have come here from the future. Huh? XL. Huh? (laugh) ♪ Thank you, Ratmosis. She's pretty. It was a pleasure serving you, sirs. I bid you peace and happiness in your future. Goodbye. I'm free! I'm free! I'm finally free! We have asked you here to give you the most precious part of your treasure. These medals bear the symbol of our magic powers. They can only be worn by those displaying superior merit. They contain powerful and mysterious magic. Come forward and let us place these precious medallions upon you. ♪ Wear these with dignity and pride. ♪ Many years of research conducted by our most learned magicians has established that only you two of all our brave descendants are truly worthy to wear these sacred symbols. Use them wisely for good and for the better. ♪ -Any luck? -No, I've looked everywhere. There's no sign of them. Maybe they decided to try and stow away on another pirate ship. I don't think so, if I know them, they're probably searching this place up and down for some of that legendary treasure. Well, I don't see why we should all have to wait for those two. Let's leave without them. Come on, Toy, you know better than that. We'd never abandon our friends. We'd better form a search party. Send a team out in every direction. Simba! Simba! I found XL's hat! Oh, no! It's over there in the ruins. Follow me, it's not very far. Here it is. But how did it get stuck? Beats me. Maybe it was foul play. Huh? ♪ This is so frustrating. I wish he could talk like us. I can't understand half the signs he makes. ♪ Hey, the rock moved. It's probably an entrance. Oh. Well, nobody's going to hold our friend underneath this rock. ♪ One thing's for sure. Both Thin and XL came here. You sure? You smell through rock? Of course I can. My nose is never wrong. Let's try to force the doorway open. Everybody get big rock. What's going on Flash, you look like you've got a plan of your own here? Uh-huh. ♪ It's opening! Wow! ♪ Look! -Whoa. -They're unconscious. We have to get them out of there. -I'll go. -Wait, Simba. If you don't mind, I think I should be the one to go in. After all, we can't take a chance on the king falling, too. ♪ They don't look too good, but I am getting a pulse. -Tonic, please. -Here, Alex. -More? -No, that's fine. Any broken bones? Not that I see. The treasure, Thin, we forgot the treasure. Go back. What's going on? Ratmosis, where are you? Yoo-hoo. They must've fallen on their heads. Ratmosis, open up, we forgot to go back for the treasure. Wake up, you two. Dream time's over, and we want to talk to you. Huh? I'm not sure they're completely with us. They have a strange look in their eyes. Huh? Hey. Finally. ♪ We're glad to have you back. You must've really bonked your heads. I suppose you fell down there looking for treasure. No, you're wrong. We didn't bonk our heads. But we did find treasure, and we met Ratses II, the Pharaoh, and his wife, Queen Cheddarisis. ♪ We really did meet the ancient Egyptians, you know? You don't believe us, but it's true. We saw them in person. Hey Alex, how long before they're back to normal. Huh? What do you think? Was it real or not? Was it a dream? -The medal! -Hey! I knew it, it wasn't a dream! Wait a sec, it'll only be true if I have a medal, too. We'd better not tell anyone. They'll think we're loony. I wonder what kind of magic it does. And how it works. I don't know, right now we have to keep them secret. We'll figure it all out when the time's right. Come on, let's catch up with them. ♪ ♪ Kaa? Yes, Simba. What's on your mind? You haven't said a word for the last 100 miles. I'm just watching, that's all. Since we left Egypt, we've seen a lot of new and interesting animals. We haven't seen a single monkey, it's strange. Kaa's right, we haven't seen a single one. Maybe it's too far from the jungle. No, Toy, there's monkeys in all parts of Africa. I wouldn't be surprised if they're plotting against us as we speak. Shere Khan's got them all on his side. We have to be very careful. ♪ Hey, how about we stop here for a while? Good idea, Simba, I think everyone could use a water break and a nap. We're taking a break here, everyone! ♪ What are you thinking about, my friend? What Shere Khan's going to try next. What you need, Simba, is a spy. I was thinking about that. Maybe Thin and XL should go on ahead. No, I think a bird would be better this time. Excuse me, but I could be your spy. You think you're up to it? Absolutely, I'll find out everything he's up to. This assignment could be dangerous. I don't mind, I can take care of myself. I can go with her if you want, Simba. Oh, okay, Ludwig. If you're sure you want to. Hey, I want to go on special assignment. They'll need my protection. That's very noble of you, Toy, but you won't be able to protect us up in the sky. Your vicious bark won't be enough this time. ♪ Simba, you shouldn't let them go on this mission. You need someone fast and brave. I know you're brave, Toy, but this is a spy mission, and for that, I need someone who can stay out of sight easily. The birds can do that better. So what are we waiting for? I'm ready. I don't want you to go alone. Ah, so you do need me to go as their bodyguard, right? No, Toy. I need you here. For what? I need you to get the Eagle King. Ask him to send his best scout to go along. Hurry! ♪ The Eagle and I will create a diversion. When they send someone after us, you go listen. Got it! Hey, what's going on here? Looks like company. Master, we have spies up above. I knew Simba would send someone here. ♪ Get after them, we can't let them report anything back to Simba. Our attack has to be secret. Go! As you wish, sir. ♪ Ludwig, watch out, the vultures! ♪ No, no! ♪ ♪ I'm going to tell Simba to bring some help. Make it fast. Do you see? Up there, silly, our spies and the vultures. Up there, XL. What are you talking about? Oh! All I see up there are clouds. I think you had too much grape juice. ♪ How can you not see them up there? Those vultures are after the eagle and Ludwig, are you blind? I'm gonna get Alex, you need medical attention. I don't understand. What's going on here? It must be the medal. We each have one that does different kinds of magic. That's it, mine lets me see things that are far away. We better tell Simba! Yeah! Simba! Our spies were discovered by the vultures. The canary's on her way here, but Ludwig and the eagle are under attack. Shere Khan's got an army assembled, and they're a lot closer than you think. What's the matter with you? This isn't funny at all. Come on, you guys, I'm not falling for it. How in the world would you know that? I saw it in the magic medal Ratses II gave me. It's true, Simba, these medals have special powers. And you got them from ancient Egyptians? Exactly. Earlier today, we were really hungry, and all of a sudden a piece of cheese appeared, then some grape juice. And after all that, I saw our friends in danger. That's right, except only Thin could actually see it. Right, I think I'll have Alex check you out. Egypt did something to you. We know that. Now we have magic. -Magic? -Like you. Oh, don't listen to them. I saw them acting all woozy and strange a while ago. Ah, you're having more hallucinations. They're lying to you, just like they did about that treasure. You don't know anything, Toy! We're telling the truth! Sure, pirate's honor, right? Come on, Toy, let's join the others. No, wait! Oh, they think we're a couple of loonies. Don't worry, we'll find a way to make Simba believe in us. ♪ ♪ Ludwig and the others should've come back by now. ♪ Everybody forward! ♪ Master! This is it, sir, they're on their way. ♪ He has no idea we've got our troops waiting. Should I give the order to attack, sir? I'll give it! Right, that's what I meant. I just thought we shouldn't wait any longer, master. Quiet! If we attack right now, we'll lose the element of surprise, pea brain. Oh, you're a true genius, sir. I know. Everybody ready, we're going to attack real soon? ♪ (laughing) What's so funny? Ow! I'm just happy, sir. I thought you were mocking me. No, sir, I would never dare, it's just joy. That's not what Simba's going to feel when he sees us. (laughter) Stand at attention, you twits. I didn't give permission to laugh. Sorry, sir. Next one out of order will answer to me. ♪ Look, everybody, the canary's coming back. It's too quiet. Shere Khan must be up to something. ♪ Simba, I have urgent news for you! Shere Khan and his army are hiding just behind that hill. Shere Khan's army's a lot closer than you think. It's true, Simba, these medals have special powers. It was true. Thin and XL weren't lying. Their medals do have magic powers. There's Ludwig and the eagle. ♪ Be ready, in a few minutes, we're going to charge Simba and his troops, and we'll crown me the new king because I am the mightiest of all! (cheering) Master, Simba's army has stopped moving. I think they've spotted us. Then we attack. Move out! Let's go! Attack! ♪ Hooray for us! ♪ ♪ Simba, Shere Khan's army is headed this way. We need our orders! He's right, we need to move fast. All right, we'll meet him head on. The elephants will go in first. Let's trample that tiger! ♪ All you bears take the right flank, go! ♪ No, Simba, you can't go into battle with them. We need you as our leader. I can't let you take that kind of risk. All right. We'll be fine! ♪ ♪ (cheering) This is really serious. We'd better help the injured. ♪ ♪ Go get him! Huh? ♪ (sneezing) ♪ Oh no, master, you're allergic to feathers. Look at Flash! He's a one-man army. He's amazing, do you see what he's doing? ♪ XL, let's go out there and show our stuff. Yeah! What are you doing? Yeah, we want to get out there. It's too dangerous. You could get trampled, even with your magic medals. He finally believes us. And it's about time. ♪ ♪ That creature has knocked out half my troops! I think that creature is a dinosaur from the Valley of Time, master. That's impossible! Dinosaurs are extinct. They've all disappeared. ♪ Cowards! Get back out there and finish them off immediately or you'll have to answer to me! Ah! All right, Simba. I'll give you this one, but don't even think it's over. (cawing) ♪ ♪ -Yoo-hoo, Simba! -Huh? You look pretty depressed for someone who defeated Shere Khan. Yeah, you should be celebrating. I know, but until I figure out how to get food for everyone, especially the injured, there's nothing to cheer about. And while we're just sitting here, I'm sure Shere Khan's busy planning more attacks, but I'm glad you guys are here because I want to talk to you. Tell me about your medals. Ready? This is Ratses II, the Pharaoh. He's the one who gave us these medals. They have special powers developed by the ancient magicians. Incredible, and you can see what's happening in other places and predict danger with those things? No, mine's for wishes, Thin's is the one that sees things. Like Shere Khan's attack yesterday. Hey, you want me to show you? It's real neat. ♪ ♪ I want an update of the situation from all of you, group by group. I want to know how many troops are still battle worthy. That's incredible, your medal's very powerful. ♪ I think our magic's really thrown him through a loop. ♪ ♪ Huh? ♪ ♪ You know, Baloo, I've been thinking a lot about our jungle, too. When do you think we might get back home? Depends on Simba, I guess. You know what it is that I miss the most about our jungle? No, what? It's winding myself around a strong branch and soaking up the sun. ♪ And sleeping all day. What I miss the most are the honey bees and their honey. ♪ Don't know what I would give for just a spoonful of honey now. There's one thing I don't understand. Every time you steal honey from the bees, you get stung, but it never stops you from doing it. It's just too good to pass up, Kaa. It's worth getting a few bee stings. Well, maybe the bees around here will be more friendly. ♪ ♪ Huh? ♪ ♪ Simba? Are you all right? What happened to you back there? Nothing, Buckshot, I must've tripped on a rock or something, that's all. I don't see any rocks around here. ♪ He sure is acting strange. ♪ ♪ I have to get to the bottom of this. Something is definitely preoccupying Simba. ♪ ♪ Ah-ha, so she's the reason Simba can't seem to concentrate on where he's going. Hey, you guys, I think Simba has a big crush on someone. -Are you serious? -Where'd you hear that? A crush? ♪ I don't want him to hear you. He's too much. It's very hot, and all the animals could use some rest. Maybe we could stop for a while. What do you think? At least answer my question, Simba. Do we stop or not? Simba! Huh, what is it? I was saying we could all use a break, and I think it includes you. I don't need to rest. I've never been better, Buckshot, but you're probably right about the others. They'll need to rest. Everybody stop here. ♪ Oh, my paws. ♪ ♪ ♪ Hey, Simba! Alex told me we're staying three more days. Is something wrong? Yes, Buckshot, too many of our friends are injured. They need the rest.

Yes, but what really bothers me is his arrogance. I want him gone. Do you hear? But how? That's what you're supposed to tell me, Kerdi. But you never like my plans, master. I know, but I want you to feel important. What if we charge them with elephants? Oh good, but aren't they all on Simba's side? I know, but maybe we could bring them to our side. It was so sweet, I wanted to sing! I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of Ferna in the near future. Are you sure? You're not making this up, huh? You all should be thanking me instead of doubting my word. I'm the one who brought them together. Fine, we all thank you. Now the rest! Tell us! Let's see, where was I?

Good idea! ♪ ♪ (cheering) Shere Khan and his troops are getting ready to climb to the top of Kilimanjaro. If he reaches the high ground, he'll have a better position to attack. We can even see them preparing different strategies. If we let him set up camp on the summit, we'll have a hard time getting rid of him. He must be stopped. But Eagle, how can we stop him from getting up there first? I don't know, but we cannot stay down here out in the open. ♪ We can't keep fighting him forever. We'll never have peace. ♪ There's only one solution. I have to defeat Shere Khan once and for all. But you've defeated Shere Khan plenty, and it hasn't stopped him.

Who else but Simba and his friends would have anything to do with us, hmm? I don't know, I haven't met the locals yet. What on earth ever made me pick you as my right paw? Well, if you recall, no one else wanted the job, and you needed someone who can catch rabbits. No one really likes me, do they? Not a one? No, sir, not when they can be friends with Simba instead.
