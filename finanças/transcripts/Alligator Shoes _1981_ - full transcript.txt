Do you know how long it's been, since I've wanted a pair of alligator shoes. I'm sorry sir. Those aren't alligator shoes. What! Those are turtle skin shoes. Turtle! Who in the hell heard of turtle shoes! Snake! Snake. You mean to tell me, they make snake shoes also? God damn snake shoe. We even carry elephant skin shoes. Elephant? Look lady. All I want is ordinary, everyday alligator shoes. That's nice. Have you any chicken shoes around here? Why? I do a lot of running sometimes. [lady] That will be six hundred and twenty three dollars.

Listen, you goddamn fraud! You told me about the oil. But what abut the goddamn transition? I didn't hear you say anything about that! I didn't hear you say, how it was going to blow the first week I had it! Look, I can't be responsible for that. Now when you buy a used car, you know what it's like.

She's gonna come in from the hospital tomorrow. Your father and I will decide if it will be alright, if she stay here. Her husband, not want her no more. I want to know if it will be okay with you two. No way! There's no way I wanna be in the same house as her! She's a goddamn loony! It's the second time she's been in there, and she will probably be in again. She will probably kill someone this time. And it's not gonna be me. Come on Mike, you're just afraid to be around her. You're goddamn right. She'll probably drive us all crazy. I don't trust her. She's not gonna drive anybody crazy. Maybe you're right, Maybe she'll drive you nuts, cos you're so weak minded in the first place. I ain't weak minded. I just don't like being around crazy people. Makes me nervous. Specially a relative. They're to close to you. And you wonder if it's gonna happen to you next. Don't worry about it. And like you said, she is family. Family. She's been in and out hospitals all her life. And she doesn't even speak French. I'll take care of her. I don't mind talking to her, I never have. You're gonna regret it Bin. She ain't gonna be nothing but trouble to you. You'll see. Well I gotta go. I'm off to sell a car or two. Did you know, mom, that there was a sucker born every minute. Yes, I know.

I don't know, Bin. My wive's not to happy about it. She says you're a rip off artist. She said, how come last time we bought a car from you, and in the last three months and then the engine blows up. Frank. Listen to me Frank. You know why that happened. Now I told you before you bought the car, that it burned a bit of oil. And I also told you every couple of weeks, put in a quart. Now it's not as if I didn't tell you, right? I mean, I didn't have to say anything. I'm not like that, I wouldn't rip you off. That last car I sold you, was a hell of a good deal. You know that Frank, don't you. I guess so. It's just that the wife says. If we're gonna buy a shit box, let's save some money and buy a new shit box. Listen, Frank. Why would you want a new car? I mean, first of all you know how expensive they are. And you have to worry about breaking them in. You don't have to worry about what color you're gonna get. And most of all, Frank. You don't have to worry about that first scratch. Do you know how hard it is, living with that first scratch on a new car! It's gonna drive you nuts, just thinking about it. We also know how much kids around here, just love to jump on a new vehicle. [Bin] Man, you gotta be living in constant fear. And Frank. Insurance. You know what insurance cost on a new car. Jesus! No, you don't want a new car. You go ahead. Get one and see if it's worth it. [Bin] Instead I could sell you this beautiful, seventy three satellite, that's scratched just a bit. And besides when you buy your new car. As soon as your drive off the lot, that's a thousand dollars depreciation. All I'm charging you is, eight hundred dollars for this car. That's two hundred dollars less than what, you're gonna loose in the first place No Frank. I rust you, and you trust me. And listen, after we make this deal. Go back home, take your wife, take her for a drive in the country, Frank. She won't only understand... But she will respect you for making such a great decision. Believe me! Here, I'll have you sign here. Don't worry, Frank. It's okay. It's a good car. Cos you get another 40, maybe 50 thousand miles out of it. If you remember to put in that quarter oil, every couple of weeks. [laughing] See, I told you I could do it. You're not doing it right at all. [Bin] Danielle! We didn't hear you come in. Wow, it's great to see you. Come on in. Come on in and sit down. Wow! You look great! I can't get over it. Doesn't she look fantastic Mike? Can I get you something? -Maybe a beer? -Oh, no. No, thanks. I don't want anything. All these pills I take, I'm not supposed to mix them with alcohol. I, um. I hope I won't be too much trouble for you guys. When I get back on my feet... I'll get a job, and I'll get a place for Jenny and me. Well, that's okay. I'll be sharing Mike's room anyways. You don't mind, do you Mike? No, I don't mind. Listen, though. When do you think you will be getting Jenny back? Well. Children's Aid told me that, she has a really good home. And she's happy. They told me that I have to prove to them, that I'm capable of taking care of her, before I can get her back. But they'll see. I'm doing real good now. And I'm getting better. Especially now that I'm with the people that I love. I'm not with strangers anymore. I'm with family. [Bin] So, tell me. How did it go in there? Did they treat you alright? A lot of loony people in there. God! A lot of really crazy people. You'll go nuts just being around them. Some of the doctors are crazy too. You ask me, they should be committed themselves. There's this one guy. And you're not going to believe this, Dr. Bow Drug. You know, like in French. Beautiful drugs. [Danielle laughs] Anyway, he'd ask me questions about my past. About my father. I wouldn't tell them nothing about my father. Instead, I used to tell them sexy stories, about the things I had done with different men. He's always start the same way. I'd be talking, and start, stroke my leg. Real gentle and slow. And start to, move it up. Slower. And slower. Just as he reached the top. Watch out! The people will bite you. [Danielle laughs] I used to die laughing, I used to laugh so hard. That they used to have to call in the staff to take me back. [laughing] It felt good to get him. I'm out of there now. And it feels good. It feels real good. And I'm never going back there! Never! Well, come on then. Let me take you to your room, okay. You look good Mike. You look real good. In the sanitarium, I was taught how to make a dress without a pattern. Oh, hi Danielle. You here! Sit down, sit down! You know. It's so good to see you again. [both laugh] Rose, I really wanna thank you for taking me in. I don't know what I would have done otherwise. It's nothing. You know you are my favorite sister. [both laugh] I hope so. You know I asked mom and dad first. She said, no! That old bitch! She never cared for me. Neither of them did. You know, as far as they're concerned I don't even exist. Their both just, -Goddamn! -Danielle. Not talk like this about your parents. They're bless. I don't care. They hate me. They don't hate you. They are too old to take care of you. They can't even take care of themselves. That's not true. They don't love me, that's all. They never did. That's why they sent me to reform schools all the time. They couldn't stand having me around/ Danielle, do not put the blame all on them. You were not an easy girl to take care of, you know. [Rose] You were always getting in trouble. Stealing. Fighting. Yeah, well. The shrink told me it was my way of getting back at them. I don't know much abut doctors. How do you call them, shrinks. You know sometimes they are right, but sometimes they are wrong. Right? And this side, this is the past. Just think about the future now. No. [both laugh] I'm sorry Rose. I didn't mean to start anything. Look at me, one day out and already I'm upset. I'll be okay. Hey, I really envy you. You got a nice house and a husband and a healthy family. You must be really happy. I envy you too. You are a beautiful. You got a nice figure. You are younger than me.

It was fantastic. Did you see Mike's face when someone handed him the dummy. ]both laugh] You remember Danielle, when we were young. A long time ago. How we were playing on the river. I mean, we were playing on the ice. And we were jumping from one chunk to the other. And then the last one finally drifted down the river. Yeah, right. And you started to cry, cos you were standing there all wet. And you pee'd your pants. -I did not! -You did so! You're the one that pee'd yourself, not me! I got wet because I was sitting on the ice, that's all. Liar! I did not. Now you want to reverse the story. You're the one who's reversing the story. You just can't take the truth, that's all. Okay, well. Maybe I pee'd a little. But that was only to make you not feel all alone. I was always having to prove to you guys that I was brave. Oh yeah! Well I remember you. You were going like this. [crying] Oh yeah! Well you look like this. [Danielle crying] [both laughing] I shouldn't have had all those drinks. I get drunk so easily. Hey. It's gonna be great to go to the country tomorrow. [Danielle] Jenny's gonna be there. I can't wait to see her. Hey Bin. Thanks for tonight. You were great. Don't thank me. Thank the dummy. He's the reason why I did everything. No. No, it's you that's great. [Bin] No! This is wrong! Please, Bin. I want you. You're the only one who understands me. You're the only one who cares. No! No! And I mean it. Listen, Danielle. Maybe we had too much to drink, okay. I know you won't say no. Will you. [car hooting] Well! What do you think? How do you like it? How do I like what? Your armpits? No, no stupid! How do you like my new place? [Bin] What do you mean your new place? [Mike] Up there, on second floor. That's where I'm gonna be living in a week. Are you crazy. You mean to tell me, that you gonna rent, a stupid two by four room, instead of living a home? Listen. Don't try to talk me out if this, okay. I've been wanting to do this for a long time, and I'm gonna do it. You're crazy, you know that. You're nuts! You've got everything you could possibly want. Mom does all your cooking. She does your laundry, everything. Why would you wanna give all that up. So I could be alone. So you can be alone. What for, you can jerk off! All yo have to do is lock your goddamn door. Don't talk stupid, okay. I just want to be away from everybody. Away from all the crazy people. What crazy people? You mean Danielle? Listen, Mike. You can't run out on us now. Our family and relatives, we have to stick together. All of us. Look at all the people out there who are screwed up, cos their family fell apart. You know outside our family, there's no one that cares about us. Nobody! So Danielle's a little mixed up. Big deal. We can take care of that. Well I can't, I've had it! Wow. Why don't you drive for a change. [both laughing] Have we got enough! [Mike] Come on, hurry up! Come on, Bin! [Bin] Wait a minute. [Mike] Come on! Can't wait all day. What are you doing? Come on! Hold on to your horses. Come on! Come on! Come on, take them. I'm gonna drop them right here. Crazy maniac. Remember a long time ago when we were kids? At that pissing contest and you always won. Boy could you do it far. Remember, I used to draw a line. I bet on all the kids could go over it without touching it. We used to get them every time. Yeah, but that was a long time ago. You know I bet you I couldn't do that now. Even if you went and put an extension on it. [Bin] So did you have a good time at the dance last night? It was alright. I guess. [Bin] You guess? Christ, I can see you right now. The way you were dancing around with that dummy, I thought for sure you're gonna take that home. [Bin] I was sure it was love at first sight. [Bin laughing] It wouldn't be any worse than the dummy you took home. What do you mean? I can just hear you giving her the line. Danielle. Do you wanna get better. Pull my zipper down, You don't know what you're talking about! All you care about is yourself. Yeah! What about the people you rip off every day of the week! You try and tell me you care for them! That's different! They're not family! Don't give me that family bullshit! You just wanna fuck her! [Mike shouting] [both moaning] [Mike] Come on! Are they dangerous? I don't know. You think they bite? I don't know. I think it's psychotic! Look at it. How can you tell! [Mike] Look at the eyes man. It's in the eyes. Don't show it your fear. I think it can smell it. Shall we throw a rock at it? What! And start a rampage. [both laugh] You know it's been a long time since we had a good fight. Come on, brother. Howdy! [all laugh] [casual country music] [car hooting] [both cheering] [foreign language] [Mike] I didn't think we would make it around the corner. That's goddamn Mike. Every time he has one beer we have to stop. [French language] [Mike] I gotta go for a piss, see ya. [screeches] [foreign language] Look Grandma. I'd love to talk to you know but I gotta go to the wash room. Dad was here and he told me he'd love to hear the story. [foreign language] There he is. Okay sure Grandmother, anytime. Get ready! Get set! Go! Well I couldn't really tell but I think it was Bin. What are you talking about? I was way ahead of him. Besides, I thought you said you couldn't tell. You asked me, so I told ya. You're full of it! [Bin] Hi, Danielle. How's Jenny? [Mike] What's the mater with her? Oh I don't know. Maybe the dummy turned her down after all. [both laugh] [Bin] How's it going dad? [French language] [Bin] That's not bad. Not bad at all. I bet you this things pretty fast. Better believe it. It sure puts anything else around here to shame. Especially, that thing! No, I don't wanna race with you. I'm pretty sure this thing could take my car. No, no! That's not what I had in mind at all. I was just wondering if this thing of your's, can drive right through the garden? I don't know. Looks kind of muddy. Mike told me you can do it. He said you're probably the only one here who can. No problem, Look at that thing. How could it miss. I'm willing to bet on it. -20? -You're on! Hey wait a minute. What do I get out of this? It's my car, here. I'm in. I'll show you what this thing can do. Okay. What do I have to do exactly? All you have to do is drive right though the garden, from the road, and land right on the grass there. And you can start anywhere you want. [Bin] No other rules. Okay. No sweat. [giggling] [Bin] That's not bad. Not bad at all. But just not quit good enough. Oh my! [Bin] Thanks a lot, that was the easiest 40 bucks I ever made. Well, I'd like to see you do it! [Bin] And how much would you like to bet? 52. It's exactly what I've got and I will bet you every cent. Okay. But don't forget, there are no other rules. I don't care how you do it. Just get it through that garden. Okay, well let's get this thing outta here. [Bin] Mike throw me the helmet. Throw me the helmet. We gotta make sure we're safe around here. Will you pass me the beer Mike. My God! Hey, Adrian. Will catch you later, okay. What car you got here? Hey, he's not stopping. What the hell's he doing? We said no rules. [everyone cheering] [Mike] That was beautiful! [Adrian] Are you crazy man! You wrecked my car. I can't believe you did that! [Bin] Well we said no rules, remember. Someday when you know how to drive, come back and try it again. Some people just have no sense of humor at all. So what do you think little girl? You wanna see mummy? So how's it going? Are you having a good time? Why aren't you talking to me? Is it because of last night? Look Danielle. I really think an awful lot of you. We've had some really good talks. And I really enjoyed them. But last night I really think we went just a little too far. [Bin] I mean. Well you know, my intentions weren't, like that. Come one, why don't we go and have some fun-- I don't want too. Come on, Bin. [Bin] Okay, don't talk to me. See if I care. Why don't you tell me what's the matter? Well if you change your mind, just ask for the kid. They'll know where to find me. Or just follow the scent of empty beer bottles, until you come to a full one. [Bin] That will be me at the other end. Come on! Don't take life so seriously. Enjoy yourself. Mingle. You never you. You may even find another dummy. [Bin] fourteen dollar shoes. You know these shoes probably cost for than your car. [Mike] Kidding! [Bin] I saw a car just like yours. [Mike] Well, they're ugly anyway. [Bin] Maybe your cars worth 1000 bucks. [Adrian] You saw mine out there, and you know it's not worth that much, do you. [Bin yells] [Mike] Get her Bin. Get her! [Mike yells] Come on Danielle, just one little pinch. [Rose shouts] [Mike] It was the biggest throughout the day. [Mike] Well? [Bin] Well. [Mike] Well. -[Bin] Well. -[Mike laughs] I'm going to bed. [Bin] Well go, it's about time. [rain and thunder] Bin. Bin don't go to sleep. [Danielle] I need to talk to you. Please. I need, to talk. What. I'm so tired. [Danielle] Bin. I need to talk. About my feelings. Well why don't you go to bed, please. [eerie music] Danielle. That was a hell of a move! Maybe you did right. [Mike coughing] [Mike panting] No! [Mike] Hey, did you see anybody out there? [boat man] I ain't seen nothing. [Mike] It's important, somebody may have drowned! Can I borrow your boat to look. [boat man] Coming in. As fast as I can. I ain't see nothing here. Come on! [boat man] Almost, young fella. Nice catch hey. [Mike] Fuck! You crazy bastard! I got it from a guy up river. It only cost me a buck. [Bin] Where are my shoes? Where are my shoes? I threw them in the water! You what! I threw them in the water! You don't throw alligator shoes in the water. Not fucking alligator shoes! You throw alligators in the water. You goddamn mean! Are you crazy or something? You're worried about stupid alligator shoes. You just left her hanging there? Hey! You didn't really throw them in, did you? [Mike screams] [Mike] You bastard! You bastard! It wasn't meant to be that way. [Bin crying] I tried! I did everything I could. She just, She just couldn't cope. She couldn't! She thought it was the only way out. [Bin crying] It wasn't my fault. What else cold I do? What else? What can I do! Tell me. What! [Mike] Okay. I'm gonna see Jenny. You're what! I'm gonna see Jenny. Someone has to take care of her. Wait! I'll go with you.
