The first one felt more like a romance. The second one felt more like a friendship. You know what? What is your earliest memory? What's that? No, um... there's a passage in a book I read recently. And then I tried to remember mine. I'm not sure. Well... maybe it's that. Disney's Dumbo cartoon scared the hell out of me. Dumbo? The elephant? No. Yes. No. If you've never seen it, look at it. That one's really scary. What? Is that so? Yeah. - Yeah. I think it was... when i cried because Mieko bit my hand Does a mikeo live that long? Yes, he is. He's older than me. So, you know, about him... He's so fucking condescending. That's Mikeo. He knows. The one that goes round and round on the ceiling. Like a merry-go-round? I think I was looking up at it from my crib.

Not yet fully elongated while still retaining their shriveled leaves. Only the flowers open." I was studying when I got off work. The manager said I could use the corner. You see, we're a single-mother family. I'm told if I wanted to go to university, You have to study steadily from the first year. Unless You can't compete. step Hey, Riku... Didn't you have a date with Yo today? Oh, no? Yo said she was going out with Riku on Saturday. We went to see the paintings together. Paintings? Like in museums? Nun Gallery. Like a certain watercolourist's solo exhibition. But Yo left first. Well, that's all right. She don't want people to think she's weird. Weird? Because... Riku and Yo are together, right? What? Is that so? What? No? What? I'm not sure. What? Why? Hmm? Huh? Why did you think that? I don't... I just thought it'd be a good fit. Uh... I don't know. Do you also think like that, Right?

I have a dream that I see over and over again. Just let it go! Sachiyo. That's the dream. Or is it a distant memory? I'm not sure. When I have that dream. I don't feel scared or sad. Just- Dangling in mid-air... The only word that came to mind was floated in the air. Alone in the air I'm here. I thought they'd all forgotten about it. Ah... rice. It's okay. Miko-san already done it. He says it's a feast today. See, I knew this day would come. Did you... go today? Sachiyo? Was she there? Did you say anything? Well... When I was there... When your mother left... Yo was only three years old. When Yo get older. I thought we'd have a proper chat. But Now you're here, I don't know how to tell you this. Couldn't figure it out. Yo. Now' you are all grown-up Maybe it's time. Can we have a talk? Sachiyo... All day long, all the time. She just wanted to paint. She also loved Yo. I'm not lying about this. She didn't run away from home because she hated you. It's really... I'm talking about you chan She took good care of you. But painting was also important. Me and Sachiyo. We didn't get along. Like, women doing work. I mean, I didn't help out much with the housework. that sort of thing... We discussed things very seriously. We were young. Things are very serious. But that's where it got decisive. Between me and Sachiyo-san... Something about- There was something important. We've lost it The truth is, you don't have to go through all that. More blurred out... If only I could have carried on. Maybe I should have. But we're Things were already worse. We were too clear In hindsight, though... As a couple or as a family. don't know what was worse. There's no answer to such pursuit. She couldn't take it anymore. She left the house on her own. Without me? And that's how it turned out. Even though she loved me? She had to. At that time she was... I know understand. She love her child, but... Leaving home without that child. How is it possible For adult? I don't know. I've been thinking about it ever since that day. Adults are... Can they forget the faces of the children they gave birth to? She never saw my face. Never seen me. Yo No, it's not like that. Shortly before the yo came back... I got this mail. I'm sure she noticed yo Do you hold a grudge? About your mother? Don't know. Because I don't know her well enough to hate or resent her. Right. Do you want to see her? If the Yo wants to see her. She can do that, too. You don't have to give an answer right away. But remember. The Yo always shines when it wants to. As a daughter you can meet Sachiyo. With Yoshiko & Hinata-chan How's it going? There's nothing wrong with that. Really? Yes Yo, Yoshiko and... Hinata-chan and I... We want to live. Sorry about earlier. I'm sorry, Hinata. sister's precious book. I'm sorry I ripped it up. No, I'm good. Yes. Delicious. here too You'll be sleeping near the yo. You'll be covered in sweat. They say children have a high body temperature. Hinata seems really warm. Really, I'm sorry. I'll find the same book and get it for you. But enough of that. When I first saw Hinata. I thought she looked like a tiny monster. When we met in that shop... This monstrous child. She's going to be my sister. Oh, sorry. We took the liberty of... No, it's not like that. I thought she was going to be my sister. I don't know how to put this well. I was kind of happy. I was happy, you know. Yo-chan Welcome home. I'm back. You're early. Last meeting today was cancelled. I got back earlier than I expected. Yes. Where's the hinata? Pick up? Yeah, it's still early. I'll go after I rest a bit. Do you need help? No I'm the kind of person who's more comfortable doing everything myself. That's what I'm talking about. You're a lot like your father. Really? Yes. You know... Did anyone teach you these things? Aunt Emi taught me. Dad's younger sister There are also recipe notes. Wow. That's great. Can I watch? Yeah. - Okay. You know Yeah, what's that? I met my mother today. How did it go? It was Good to see her. Ok Yoshiko san Hmm? What is it? Can I call you mother from now on? What's wrong? Just give me a hug. what's that? I'm not Hinata. It's same What is it? Do you still have time? Hey, where should I be looking? Look this way. The other day... I'm sorry I left so abruptly. No. Was everything okay? Business. Yes Next time, Let's go where you want to go. Anywhere is fine. Where do you want to go? I'll think about it. Before We we're talking about the earliest memory we can remember. Do you remember your? Yeah, I remember. I suddenly remembered the other day. It's just... With mom it's a sight to see the plane like this. Maybe I've got a dad who's going abroad to work. Memory of coming to see him off. Mom at that time. looked very anxious. She's holding my hand. Her hands are very strong. That was a bit painful. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about my childhood. Surgery. I hope it goes well. It will be fine. As soon as I opened my eyes I forgot the dream I just had. I'm trying to remember it all over again. I closed my eyes. But it's not just a dream. I couldn't even remember what I was dreaming about. how are you? He's not well. That's why he's in hospital. That's not what I meant. It's a figure of speech. But, you know... You look good. Yes Here, have some of this. Maybe some pudding? Ew, thank you. I just... Here For me? Yeah. I picked it out with Hinata. It's so beautiful, thank you. Tell her thank you. Oh... I'll go borrow a vase. Oh, we'll go, won't we? Why? Sit down. It's hurting? Not at all. I'm not feeling pain anywhere. Ok I miss her, Hinata-chan. She was telling I'm going to see my brother. She wouldn't listen. It was difficult when I left. Mom was very worried about you. Mom? mother The House of the yo is... The Yo's family is a ideal family. We all decided to do it. Because we live together. Is that so? Pudding. Do you want some? Thank you. Riku won't have? Yeah, I'll have some later. Thanks. Please, seriously. No, it's too much trouble. You're not involved in any club activities. That's fine, right? No, I can't, I can't. Good work, then. Wait, wait! Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Hey, Riku. No, it's nothing. No, it's not nothing. I was asking him to delivered it to Saki's house, but he refused. Saki? Yeah. You were off today. -I had a cold. Tomorrow's ethics Our group will present... Leader, it's Saki. I wanted her to check it out. So I was going to deliver it. But I was suddenly called by the basketball team. Substitutes for practice matches I can deliver it if you like. Really? No, no, no, it's fine! You've been sick. No, no, no. I can live a normal life. It doesn't bother me at all. I live nearby. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm seriously trying to help. Yeah. Thank you! Yeah. - Yeah. Then say hello to Saki. Okay. Seriously, thanks. Yeah. I really do. I'll buy you a juice at the Red Balloon next time. Seriously, thanks! See you later. Thank you. Riku, what? Miyao asked me to give this to you. Oh... The one he's announcing tomorrow? Damn him... Forcing Riku to do troublesome things. And this. Pudding, jelly, whatever you like. Oh, thank God. Are you alone? Yeah. Mum's always at work. Here. Thanks. Look, if you get sick, you'll be in trouble, get the hell out of here. Are you sure you're okay? Let me know if you need anything else. I'll get it at the convenience store. You don't need to feel pity for me. pity? I couldn't go to prep school. I've been studying at the shop. Even though I have a cold sleeping alone at home. something like that Because Riku is kind. You have a lot of problems your own , Riku. Useless broken heart, maybe? I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. Oh, no. I'm sorry too. I was just joking. It didn't look like it. But if it's really hard on you, just tell me, Miyao or whoever. Okay, thanks. Tell them about the land, too. You don't have to make jokes about it. Yeah, OK. well then. Well then. It's not sympathy It's not like that. It's not about sympathy or anything like that. I don't want you to think that way. Understand. Bye. If you're not busy, why don't you study? Good morning. Good morning. Sorry. For calling you out so early in the morning. What? Me I like you, Riku-kun. Riku... What do you... think about me? I don't really know. Isthat so? Sorry What about club activities? Still can't seem to resume? It seems so. Is that so? Oh! Nice. Riku! Are you okay? It's all right. Do you want me to call an ambulance? Not at the hospital. Not at home. Do not contact. I'll be fine after a bit of a break. But I can't leave you like this. I made milk tea. Thank you. Are you sure you're OK? After all, you can tell me if you're having trouble. Don't be shy. Yes. You work in English, right? Oh... It's not that big of a deal. Since I was a student. English was the only thing I was good at. So it's more like a process of elimination. Well, it's just nature. Riku, you can study, right? maybe you had a college you wanted to go to or something. I don't know what I want. Yo has a drawing. In my opinion, she's very talented. Other classmates... They're aiming for university, they're doing club activities... I've had something I wanted to do. I was making progress. I used to be vaguely interested in... I thought it would be nice to be a basketball player. If that doesn't work... I'd like to have a job where I can travel all over the world like my father. At first, I didn't think it would be too hard. But after the actual operation... I'm going to spend the rest of my life in this condition. I felt like I was being confronted with the reality Me too. There's so much I can't do. Me, too. When I see movies and read novels... I always think it's amazing. The people who create these things are I'm really amazed. People who can draw or... And Yo's father who can make music. I always envy him. Before, Riku-kun and Yo... Went see her mother's painting gallary, right? Mother? Yes, the mother who gave birth to Yo. Yo didn't tell you? People who draw pictures of beautiful flowers. Uh... yes. I don't think she could have gone alone. Because Riku was with Yo. She got the courage to go and see her. After that...she went to see her mother again. Now they're exchanging e-mails and stuff. It sounds like she's been able to talk to her about the painting. You don't like that kind of thing? Yo meeting her mother. No.. No It's good to see her, I think. Because Yo hasn't been able to see her mother for a long time. You who gave her the opportunity to do that. Thanks to Riku. Thanks. I can't draw. I can't even make music. But my job... to link between the author of the story and the reader of the story. Through translation. That there's such an amazing story to tell. I discovered that there is a way to get involved in that way. I mean, I discovered it. That's what he told me. Yo's father, Before I started seeing him. Come and have dinner with us again. And Hinata wants to meet you. And Yo, of course. Oh, yeah, are you listening? Next Saturday. I was talking about having a birthday party for Yo Come and visit us. thank you for your hard work Hi Can I have a word? Do you remember when Yo and you went to see painting? Yo left first. The one you are talking about? Yes The person who painted the picture we saw was Yo's birth mother. But Yo... She didn't say a word about it to me. Is that why you're sulking? It's not like that. Just Just? Yeah? What? You're not clear. Yo confessed to me. When? Thursday morning, I was called into the art room. So? So... "What does Riku think of me?" She asked. So? So? "I don't know," i replied. What's that? I like Yo, but... But I'm not sure if that love is the same as the love that Yo has for me. Saki You told me before I and Yo are perfect match. Did I tell you? You told me that At the time, I wondered if that was the case. But I don't know, I just feel different now. Like, "We're not compatible"? Like, because there's nothing for me now? When I'm with yo, You feel like I'm inferior than her. Would I be just right for her? What's that? It's not my words. in the meantime if you feel the same Does it matter? The thing I want to say the most... I can't say... doesn't that mean you like her? Because it's important. Doesn't that mean you can't tell Her? Well, I'm not Yo. I don't know. I'm terrible at this. All right. What? Don't worry about me. So, what's that? That I'm going to die soon. And Eli will be happy. You're not involved in any of this. Not for Lemma. I'm not postponing it. I don't like that kind of thing. It's like they're telling me to hurry up and die. But it's funny, isn't it? I can't believe that a two-timing ends in the death of one of them. Is there such an friendly solution? Yeah, right. Well, it's not like I'm happier living. Eli? Do you still like them? First, this way. Yeah And... the other one is. Here Ok Don't worry about me. So what? Yeah... I don't know which one it is. They're both good. What differences did you see? The first one felt more like a romance. The second one felt more like a friendship. I see. One more time. Can I listen with headphones? Go ahead. The second one. Yeah. - Yeah. Riku-kun Are you all right? Yeah, I just came to bring some art supplies. I thought I'd bring it back since I don't do it. Bye. mother Hmm? What's wrong? Can I have a word? Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. you know what? Mom you still love dad? Yeah? Why? Next time when dad comes back. And he goes abroad again... mother should go with him. Why? Why? Because I want you to be with him. Mom and dad They're husband and wife. What's wrong? Suddenly. Don't you miss him? Are you okay without father? Well... I don't know. How's Riku? Miss him? lonely Is that so I mean, I miss him, but... Why aren't you with dad? Something about my heart. When mom talking to grandma, as am getting old I can't play basketball anymore. What I want to do. I've lost the ability to do anything. I'd like to talk to you about that kind of thing. I don't like who I am now. So, I want mother to... I want you to like me more. From now on... You're going to fly around with dad. really You are an idiot. I'm stronger than you think. Well, it's not always easy, but... Dad is always away. You know, grandma and I... I don't always get on well with her. I knew that when we got married. Besides... Since the you were small... grandmother has saved my life so many times. Really? Yes Have you heard of premature birth? Premature birth? Babies are usually... They are in their mother's womb for a little over ten months. That's how they're born. October 10 But Riku was born at nine months. So - Maybe it has something to do with your heart condition. When you was in the belly... I was working hard. that could have been the cause of the premature birth. Once I am told that... I can't help but blaming myself That I can't look after the riku properly. Day and night. I couldn't get anything done. You was crying. I was holding you. I was crying too. And your father was away. I couldn't say anything because I thought it might cause trouble. And then... Grandma, she came running. She's been pissed off. She said, why didn't I relied on her? told your father and me that we can rely on each other more. You don't have to be shy. And then... I've been supported for a long time. Grandma's nagging is her love. You can see that, can't you. Of course, I do get lonely at times. But more than that... Doing what you love. I like a father who doesn't care about his family at all. Also, about Riku Of course. I like you. "Dear Riku." "This Saturday I'm going to have my birthday party." "I haven't had a birthday party since primary school. I'm kind of embarrassed..." "my mother insisted." "And also Hinata." "Miyako and Saki. Miyako-kun is coming." "you don't have the answer yet, do you?" "And yet I'm sorry." "But. You don't have to force yourself to answer."
