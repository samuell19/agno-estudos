In the north west of Russia lies ﻿Katyn Forest, ﻿beneath which lie ﻿over 4,000 Polish officers ﻿slaughtered in 1940 ﻿by the Soviet secret police, ﻿NKVD. ﻿Lying alongside them are ﻿many other human remains. ﻿They are Soviet civilians ﻿executed in the same way ﻿just a few years earlier. ﻿The Katyn Massacre is only ﻿a fragment of truth, ﻿ ﻿a tiny faction of the heinous crimes ﻿committed in the USSR ﻿for over a decade ﻿by Stalin's executioners. ﻿Unshakable disciplined executioners ﻿that worked in the shadows ﻿and whose story, methods and names ﻿can now be revealed. STALIN AND THE KATYN MASSACRE ﻿On 1 September 1939, ﻿Nazi Germany started the blitz ﻿and invaded Poland. ﻿The Polish frontlines ﻿were soon annihilated. ﻿Warsaw ﻿ ﻿After a week, ﻿Warsaw was under siege ﻿regularly bombarded ﻿by German airstrlkes and gunfire. ﻿In the midst of the chaos, ﻿somewhere east of Warsaw, ﻿Captain Jozef Czapski ﻿roamed with his squadron. ﻿Czapski was a reserve officer. ﻿In civilian life, he was a painter. ﻿"We were exhausted ﻿ ﻿"but determined to fight the Nazis", recalled Czapski. ﻿"We tried to assemble our men," ﻿"little did we know we were ﻿about to be victims" ﻿"of one of the biggest betrayals ﻿of the 1900s," ﻿A few weeks earlier, ﻿Stalin and Hitler ﻿signed a non-aggression pact ﻿that stunned the world. ﻿But nobody knew that the dictators ﻿had secretly agreed ﻿to share Poland. ﻿And Stalin wanted ﻿his piece of the cake. ﻿On 17 September the Red Army ﻿invaded the east of Poland ﻿and took the Poles, ﻿in disbelief, by surprise. ﻿Cornered 230,000 Polish soldiers ﻿and officers were captured ﻿and disarmed by the Soviets. ﻿Captain Jozef Czapski ﻿joined a line of POWs. ﻿"Our guards said nothing ﻿and threatened stragglers," ﻿stated Czapski. ﻿"They took us west, ﻿towards Tarnopol." ﻿In Tarnopol, ﻿like in all eastern Poland, ﻿a large part of the population was ﻿from Ukraine and Belarus ﻿Two ethnic minorities ﻿seeking independence. ﻿Ukrainian population ﻿welcomed the Red Army ﻿as liberators. ﻿Soviet soldiers handed out ﻿Ukrainian newspapers ﻿announcing that the USSR ﻿considered them as brothers ﻿and that they were protected ﻿by Russia. ﻿The propaganda ridiculed ﻿the Polish ﻿Minister of foreign affairs. ﻿"Улица вспоминает пана Бэка: Какой гибкий был пан." ﻿And ridiculed the head ﻿of the Polish Army. ﻿"Пан Рыдз-Смиглы гуляет по Парижу". ﻿"Then", says Czapski, ﻿"We continued east," ﻿"towards to the Soviet border." ﻿Another reserve officer, ﻿Jewish doctor Salomon Slowes, ﻿was also captured. ﻿They crossed the Soviet border ﻿by truck. ﻿ ﻿The trip lasted several days ﻿and they took Salomon Slowes ﻿somewhere in Russia. ﻿ ﻿"We were lined up ﻿in a huge field", he recounted. ﻿"A long line of soldiers" ﻿"meandered in the middie of nowhere." ﻿"Each waited to give their name, ﻿rank and ID number." ﻿"I was next, when ﻿a guy in front of me" ﻿"proudly announced ﻿to the Soviet soldiers" ﻿"that he was a communist" ﻿ ﻿"Shut it, an officer answered," ﻿ ﻿"We've got rid of greater ﻿communists than you." ﻿"Our gaze fell upon this poor man, ﻿the journey to his dream country ﻿had filed with gloom." ﻿As for Captain Czapski, ﻿he was isolated ﻿and locked up in an odd prison ﻿along with thousands ﻿of other Polish officers. ﻿This was Starobielsk monastery ﻿close to the Soviet town ﻿of Starobilsk. ﻿On many walls," told Czapski, ﻿"there were deep cavities ﻿bored by bullets." ﻿"The guards calmly told me" ﻿"that the nobility was executed ﻿there during the civil war." ﻿"That's all I got." ﻿"Unless barking orders, ﻿our guards remained silent." ﻿"In Starobielsk", recounted Czapski, ﻿"loudspeakers would be used ﻿continuously" "to ﻿play Chopin ﻿and Mussorgsky full blast." ﻿"Over time it plunged the POWs" ﻿"into a sort of depression." ﻿"We lived on top ﻿of each other in the huts" ﻿"and many had to slip ﻿under the bunks" ﻿"not to sleep outside." ﻿ ﻿Like Josef Czapski ﻿over half of the POWs ﻿were reserve officers, ﻿civilians in uniform: ﻿physicians, engineers, ﻿teachers, lawyers, ﻿senior civil servants, architects, ﻿writers and artists. ﻿In total, 3,800 Polish officers ﻿were crammed into Starobielsk. ﻿﻿As for military doctor Salomon Slowes, ﻿he ended up in another monastery prison. ﻿It was in Kozielsk, Russia ﻿"Loudspeakers continuously played ﻿music peppered with slogans," ﻿remembered Salomon Slowes, "﻿and it got to us." ﻿"We were like in a prison camp ﻿unlike anything we knew." ﻿To pass time, ﻿he drew this new world. ﻿The church in the centre ﻿surrounded by huts thrown together into which the POWs crammed. ﻿Kozielsk held 4,500 Polish officers ﻿as POWs. ﻿There was also ﻿a third monastery prison. ﻿It was in Ostashkov, ﻿on a little island in a lake. ﻿in northern Russia. ﻿Held there were 6,500 Poles. ﻿Like their fellow Poles ﻿in Starobielsk and Kozielsk ﻿they had no idea ﻿what the Soviets had planned. ﻿They were in the clutches ﻿of the People's Commissariat ﻿of Internal Affairs, ﻿the NKVD. ﻿An implacable repressive machine ﻿of men and women ﻿blindly devoted ﻿to the Party's cause. ﻿Its bloody legacy began ﻿22 years earlier, ﻿in 1917. ﻿It was the Cheka's successor, ﻿the secret police established ﻿in 1917 by the Bolsheviks ﻿just after they took power. ﻿It was led at the time ﻿by a Bolshevik of Polish descent ﻿called Felix Dzerzhinsky. ﻿Cheka stands for ﻿All-Russian Extraordinary Commission ﻿for Combating ﻿Counter-Revolution and Sabotage. ﻿Upon its creation, ﻿it only numbered ﻿600 hard-line Bolsheviks. ﻿As the Russian Civil War raged ﻿between Whites and Reds, ﻿the Chekists had to enforce ﻿the party's dictatorship ﻿in conquered areas. ﻿Kiev, Summer 1919 ﻿ ﻿Some months later, ﻿ ﻿the Whites took ﻿Kiev from the Red Army, ﻿and revealed the Cheka's methods ﻿to the world. ﻿Proven or suspected opponents, ﻿sometimes mere onlookers ﻿and passers-by, ﻿were executed after being stripped ﻿then thrown in mass graves. ﻿The Chekist's aim was ﻿to speed up executiion ﻿of the old world ﻿an event that was inevitable ﻿to the Party. ﻿"Our action", said Dzerzhinsky, ﻿"must be assumed ﻿by the Party as a method" ﻿"to create the Communist man." But this had to remain secret. ﻿The way of achieving ﻿a proletarian dictatorship ﻿was nobody's business. ﻿If not for the Civil war, ﻿these mass graves ﻿would have remained hidden. ﻿The head of the Chakists ﻿led his troops by example ﻿as stated by Dzerzhinsky ﻿in a letter to his wife: ﻿"No time to think about you." ﻿I'm exhausted and never stop." ﻿"Я даже расстреливаю виновных собственноручно." ﻿"Мои руки в крови." На протяжении 1918, ﻿чекисты арестовали ﻿и казнили 3.000 священников, ﻿иногда заливая расплавленный свинец им в рот ﻿чтобы искупить их "грех" (веру в Бога). ﻿That was how the Cheka turned ﻿deserted monasteries into prisons ﻿and places of execution. ﻿Lubyanka Square, Moscow ﻿ ﻿Place Loubianka, Moscou ﻿Lubjanka-Platz, Moskau 00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,159 ﻿In early 1920 the Cheka set up offices in Moscow ﻿In a huge building ﻿in Lubyanka Square. ﻿The basement was turned into ﻿holding cells and an execution site. ﻿The following year, ﻿with the civil war over, ﻿Cheka grew from 600 agents ﻿to 260,000 agents. ﻿The last published figure. ﻿After this, ﻿Cheka numbers were kept secret. ﻿They locked down towns. ﻿Many people were arrested ﻿for unknown reasons. ﻿They vanished. ﻿It was as if they never existed. ﻿From 1922, ﻿Cheka took the name GPU, ﻿standing for ﻿State Political Directorate. ﻿But Dzerzhinsky and his men ﻿still called themselves Chekists". ﻿The GPU attracted opportunists ﻿not afraid to get their hands dirty ﻿or simply enjoyed doing so. ﻿Such as Lavrentiy Beria. ﻿Born in Georgia into a poor family, ﻿a man with precocious talent. ﻿Aged 18 when the Revolution began, ﻿he decided to infiltrate ﻿Georgian nobility ﻿by posing ﻿as an anti-Bolshevik activist. ﻿He then reported back to the Cheka ﻿the names of the nobility ﻿to be executed. ﻿The young manipulator ﻿was soon recruited ﻿by the Georgian Cheka ﻿where he rose through the ranks ﻿at lightning speed. ﻿Following in ﻿Dzerzhinsky's footsteps, ﻿Beria was a young local leader ﻿who commanded respect ﻿by torturing and taking out ﻿the most important suspects. ﻿Felix Dzerzhinsky died ﻿of a heart attack. ﻿He was immediately replaced ﻿by two Chekists. 00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,500 Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, ﻿a man with heart problems, 00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,000 and his deputy, Genrikh Jagoda, who would be tasked with most of responsibilities. ﻿The Party held ﻿a majestic funeral for him ﻿in line with his contribution. ﻿Dzerzhinsky left behind ﻿a repressive machine, ﻿that was also merciless ﻿and paraioid, ﻿which even terrorised ﻿its own members. ﻿Every Chekist, regardless of rank, ﻿worked with the threat ﻿of a case file ﻿that recorded their past, ﻿weaknesses and errors. ﻿Any of them could be arrested ﻿or interrogated at any time. ﻿ ﻿Tbilissi, Georgia ﻿As for the model Chekist, ﻿Tiflis, Georgien ﻿As for the model Chekist, ﻿Lavrentiy Beria, ﻿he continued his ascent. ﻿The tireless worker ﻿was in 1927 appointed ﻿head of the entire Georgian GPU. ﻿Now an absolute master ﻿in his kingdom of Tbilisi, ﻿Beria was blinded by ambition. ﻿Thq Georgian had even put down ﻿markers at the Kremlin ﻿with a Politburo member ﻿as chaperone, ﻿Anastas Mikoyan. ﻿He was an acconplice ﻿to another Georgian ﻿who had just removed ﻿all his opponents from power: ﻿Joseph Stalin. ﻿From 1929, ﻿Stalin gradually established ﻿his personal tyranny ﻿and the Chekists had ﻿to shift into high gear. ﻿The leader first sought ﻿collectivisation ﻿of Soviet agriculture. ﻿To get 110 million peasants, ﻿three quarters ﻿of the country's population, ﻿to abandon their land ﻿and join collective groups, ﻿the Chekists had to be ﻿very persuasive. ﻿This led to the GPU executing ﻿30,000 peasants ﻿after being labelled "kulaks": ﻿reach peasants. ﻿For the country, ﻿a rich peasant was one with a cow, ﻿but those described in propaganda ﻿were nothing but a fantasy. ﻿The resistance to collectivisation ﻿was particularly strong in Ukraine, ﻿the Soviet Union's breadbasket ﻿To overcome this, ﻿the Chekists deported ﻿some 110,000 Ukrainian peasants ﻿primarily to the special prison ﻿on the Solovetsky Islands ﻿in the White Sea. ﻿They were to be rehabilitated ﻿through forced labour. ﻿So many deportees were uprooted ﻿from their land ﻿that in 1931 the GPU created ﻿a new arm ﻿to its repressive arsenal: ﻿Gulag. ﻿In two years, the Chekists ﻿crushed the resistance ﻿to collectivisation. ﻿But collectivisation did not work. ﻿Production fell dangerously low ﻿while harvests were subject ﻿to completely disproportionate ﻿requisition quotas. ﻿After a disastrous harvest ﻿in Ukraine, ﻿the collective farms were forced ﻿to give their grain to the state. ﻿They had nothing to sow ﻿for the following year. ﻿A terrible famine hit Ukraine ﻿yet Stalin demanded ﻿that the quotas were upheld. ﻿On 20 November 1932 ﻿the collective farms ﻿unable to pay in grain ﻿had to pay in meat. ﻿But there was no longer meat. ﻿A week later the Chekists had ﻿to register the villages ﻿unable to meet the quota on the "black board". ﻿﻿Their last grain reserves confiscated, ﻿the peasants were banned ﻿from leaving their village ﻿to stock up. ﻿As for the consequences ﻿of this sentence, ﻿Chekists could not state it in writing. ﻿ ﻿Nobody was to know their methods ﻿for breaking the resistance ﻿and the secret had to be kept. ﻿But in spring 1933, ﻿British journalist Gareth Jones ﻿Managed to enter Ukraine ﻿without detection. ﻿Since 1929, ﻿Gareth Jones had done three reports from the field. ﻿The land was unrecognisable. ﻿The land was strewn with bodies ﻿that people had stopped burying. ﻿﻿When the journalist ﻿entered this region ﻿﻿cut off from the rest of the USSR, ﻿the Ukrainians were dying ﻿at a rate of 10,000 per day. ﻿With no other option, sometimes, ﻿the youngest was killed ﻿to feed the family. ﻿﻿Even mothers gave their life ﻿and begged ﻿their children to eat them. ﻿ ﻿This was so widespread ﻿that the GPU executed ﻿3,000 peasants for cannibalism. ﻿With his detailed articles ﻿in The Guardian, ﻿Gareth Jones revealed the extent ﻿of the famine ﻿and accused the Kremlin ﻿of being directly responsible. ﻿Moscow vehemently denied ﻿its existence ﻿﻿and accused the journalist ﻿﻿of anti-Communism. ﻿The truth revealed by Jones ﻿hit a brick wall ﻿in the form of propaganda ﻿that hammered home ﻿the official version: ﻿collectivism was a complete success. ﻿The state used images ﻿to support its lie ﻿in overwhelming proportions. ﻿While propaganda showed ﻿combines in mass, ﻿there were in fact none. ﻿And while it said ﻿Ukraine had an excellent harvest, ﻿it was in fact disastrous and people were starving. ﻿This was how the USSR managed ﻿to murder in cold blood ﻿four million Ukrainians ﻿disconcertingly in secret. ﻿In 1934, the head of the GPU, ﻿Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, ﻿died himself of a heart attack. ﻿His deputy, Genrikh Yagoda, ﻿ ﻿took over the GPU, ﻿soon renamed to the NKVD. ﻿The NKVD was the backbone ﻿of a Soviet Union ﻿that commanded propaganda ﻿in unprecedented proportions. ﻿The Chekists were the guardians ﻿of an impregnable mass of lies. ﻿They would now establish ﻿Stain's total domination. ﻿Pre-revolution Lenin supporters ﻿were previously untouchable, ﻿known as the old Bolsheviks, 00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,559 ﻿but they were the next target. ﻿Genrikh Yagoda, inspecting ﻿the Gulag's work here, ﻿had to take out the most important and fast. ﻿ ﻿Yagoda ordered the NKVD ﻿to arrest them ﻿based on false evidence. ﻿He then held show trials ﻿at the end of which the defendants, ﻿psychologically defeated, ﻿confessed to their imaginary crimes ﻿and were executed. ﻿"We have made great progress." ﻿"Firstly," ﻿"we live more comfortably." ﻿"Life is more joyful." ﻿"And joy ensures success at work." ﻿Lavrenty Beria, head ﻿of the Georgian NKVD, ﻿was now one of Stalin's confidants. ﻿He was in charge ﻿of Stalin's private security ﻿when he was on holiday ﻿in his native Georgia. ﻿Beria, seen here ﻿with Stalin's daughter on his lap, ﻿distingushed himself ﻿through the execution ﻿of Georgia's Old Bolsheviks. ﻿This ambitious Chekist had ﻿the ideal profile ﻿to lead the Soviet NKVD one day. ﻿But in 1936, ﻿Stalin chose another product ﻿of the NKVD ﻿to replace Genrikh Yagoda ﻿and guarantee the next stage: ﻿Nikolai Yezhov. ﻿A paranoid perverted being, ﻿riddled with so many diseases ﻿it was a wonder ﻿he was still standing. ﻿On Stalin's orders ﻿Nikolai Yezhov executed ﻿almost all the Red Army's generals ﻿and two-thirds ﻿of the Party's Central Committee. ﻿But this purge by the Soviets ﻿was just the tip of the iceberg ﻿of an operation as excessive ﻿as it was concealed. ﻿On 30 July 1937 ﻿Operation Order ﻿No. 00447 of the NKVD ﻿extended the purge ﻿to the wider Soviet society ﻿by setting quotas for each region. ﻿In total 200,000 so-called ﻿"criminals" and "saboteurs" ﻿were to be deported to the Gulag ﻿and 70,000 were to be executed. ﻿But the NKVD's regional heads ﻿competed zealously ﻿to exceed the quotas. ﻿They sent hundreds of requests ﻿to the Kremlin ﻿to increase deportations ﻿and executions. ﻿These were approved daily ﻿and without hesitation by Stalin ﻿and the Politburo's ﻿five other members: ﻿Voroshilov, ﻿Molotov, ﻿Mikoyan, ﻿Kaganovich ﻿and Kalinin. ﻿Most people were arrested at night ﻿and taken to one ﻿of the many NKVD prisons. ﻿Confessions were obtained ﻿through torture ﻿which was officially authorised ﻿by Party leaders. ﻿The number of "accomplices" ﻿was also obtained by torture. ﻿They were then arrested. ﻿For the next phase, ﻿the NKVD used professional killers ﻿led by Vasily Blokhin. ﻿A former shepherd known for ﻿his talent to kill in cold blood. ﻿Blokhin was appointed by Stalin ﻿as chief executioner. ﻿His role specifically included ﻿personally executing ﻿the high-profile Party members. ﻿Executions were often done at night ﻿in a soundproof cell. ﻿The victim would be held ﻿by two NKVD agents ﻿as a third shot them ﻿in the back of the head. ﻿Blokhin and his men didn't like ﻿using the Nagant revolver, ﻿the Chekist's main arm, ﻿due to it being heavy ﻿and heating quickly. ﻿They preferred ﻿German Walther pistols, ﻿an efficient and reliable weapon ﻿with a 7.65 calibre ﻿that minimised blood splatter. ﻿Thanks to Walther pistols, ﻿victims could be executed ﻿like clockwork, ﻿every two minutes ﻿if it was a busy day. ﻿The bodies were then ﻿taken away by truck ﻿either to be burned ﻿at the all-night crematorium ﻿or to be thrown in mass graves ﻿dug in secret ﻿often in woodland. ﻿They were then filled in ﻿using bulldozers. ﻿The NKVD would plant ﻿saplings immediately after, ﻿often firs as they grow fast. ﻿There was soon no trace ﻿of what happened. ﻿This methodical organisation ﻿enabled the NKVD to secretly execute ﻿some 750,000 Soviets ﻿in a year and a half. ﻿To fight traitors, murderers, ﻿fascist intelligence agents ﻿and capitalism restorers, ﻿the Party has appointed ﻿as the NKVD chief ﻿a devout son, friend ﻿and supporter of our comrade Stalin: ﻿Nikolai Yezhov. ﻿Nikolai Yezhov was the subject ﻿of a true cult of personality. ﻿But it did not last. ﻿Stalin would accuse him ﻿of letting traitors in﻿filtrate the NKVD. ﻿This led Yezhov to start ﻿purging the NKVD ﻿This led Yezhov to start ﻿purging the NKVD ﻿and the Chekists began ﻿executing each other. ﻿In this madhouse, ﻿some even died shouting: ﻿"Glory to Stalin". ﻿This self-destructive circus was ﻿nothing but a manoeuvre by Stalin ﻿to purge the purgers. ﻿He was covering his tracks. ﻿On 15 March 1938 ﻿former NKVD head, ﻿Genrikh Yagoda, ﻿was taken to ﻿Lubyanka's soundproof cell ﻿were Nikolai Yezhov awated. ﻿He had never betrayed the Party but h﻿e was now disposable. ﻿He could one day become a liability. ﻿Vasily Blokhin ﻿executed his former boss ﻿in front of his new one. ﻿A year later ﻿Stalin demoted Nikolai Yezhov ﻿and appointed Lavrentiy Beria ﻿He well knew that those who survived ﻿were collaborators ﻿Stalin saw use in, ﻿so did his all to prove ﻿how essential he was. ﻿With this aim on 17 September 1939, ﻿when the Soviet Union began its invasion of Poland ﻿Beria methodically planned ﻿Sovietisation of this territory. ﻿He ordered the Red Army ﻿to give the NKVD, ﻿at predetermined points, ﻿all the captured Polish officers. ﻿Kozielsk, January 1940 ﻿ ﻿Salomon Slowes and his comrades had been prisoners in Kozielsk ﻿for four months at the time. ﻿﻿"We were now allowed ﻿to write to our families" ﻿"even if the address ﻿Kozielsk was secret." ﻿"Our family must write ﻿to Gorki Rest House," ﻿"Moscow, P.O. Box 12." ﻿"The NKVD often held conferences ﻿on socialism" ﻿"and policy training courses." ﻿"We had to study Party history," ﻿"discuss Stalin's ﻿and Molotov s speeches" ﻿"which were broadcast ﻿via camp loudspeakers." ﻿"And often at night," ﻿"educational films were projected ﻿for us" ﻿﻿"Like 'Battleship Potemkin'." ﻿"Battleship Potemkin" by Sergey Eisenstein ﻿"A film I found nterastrg ﻿but much too theatrical." ﻿As for Jozef Czapski, ﻿ ﻿he was still imprisoned at the Starobielsk monastery. ﻿"Some nights, we were interrogated" ﻿"individually, recalled Czapski. ﻿"It wasn't about torture," ﻿"the NKVD just wanted ﻿to know everything about us," ﻿"our families, beliefs, commitments." "I was once pulled out of bed ﻿at 1 o'clock in the morning." ﻿"So, you worked as a painter in Paris" ﻿"for eight years?" ﻿Chekist asked. "﻿Yes. From 1924 to 1932." ﻿"Where your orders from ﻿your Minister of foreign affairs?" ﻿"No. He didn't know I was there" ﻿"What order did you get from his deputy?" ﻿"None. He didn't know either." ﻿"You think I'm stupid?" ﻿"You had to draw up a map of Paris" ﻿"and send it to your minister" ﻿"You can get a map ﻿on any street in Paris" ﻿"You are lying. Never lie ﻿to the NKVD, Captain Czapski" ﻿Many officers saw it as a farce. ﻿Nobody imagined ﻿it was a way to select ﻿who would live and who would die. ﻿Meanwhile, half of Poland ﻿occupied by the Red Army ﻿was officially annexed by the USSR. ﻿To oversee the operation ﻿Stalin sent a fresh member ﻿of the Politburo ﻿Ukrainian Nikita Khruschev. ﻿Nikita Sergueievitch Khrouchtchev ﻿Nikita Sergej ewitsch Chruschtschow ﻿"The changes don't look much ﻿at first sight... ﻿The same windows, ﻿but the signs are in Ukrainian, ﻿and their management is now under ﻿that of government officials." ﻿They were wiping Poland off the map. ﻿Sovietising the people. ﻿"In Western Ukraine ﻿we have opened 13 high schools." ﻿"Professor Kirill Studinski" ﻿"was shown the door ﻿by Polish authorities." ﻿"He's now a member of the Ukrainian ﻿Academy of Sciences," ﻿"and a deputy of the Supreme Soviet ﻿of the USSR." ﻿"Life has changed:" ﻿"new citizens don't simply go ﻿to school," ﻿"they want to instruct, learn" ﻿"and understand the world." ﻿While model students studied, ﻿NKVD carefully drew ﻿the list of Poles ﻿who were "unsovetisable": ﻿members of non-Communist partes ﻿and student unions, ﻿police and all armed officers, ﻿anyone that had bean abroad, ﻿government heads of service and those superior, ﻿ ﻿journalists, artists, members of the clergy, ﻿ ﻿industrialists, business owners, ﻿and hotel and restaurant owners. ﻿Lubyanka, NKVD Headquarters ﻿ ﻿4 February 1940 ﻿ ﻿Beria scrupulously studied ﻿the reports ﻿sent by commanders at Kozielsk, ﻿﻿Starobielsk and Ostashkov. ﻿After five years' detention, ﻿the Poles were unsurprisingly deemed ﻿impervious to the work ﻿of political education. ﻿They formed ﻿intellectual resistance groups ﻿﻿and illegal religious services. ﻿Some even openly described ﻿the USSR as an imperial state. ﻿It was time for Beria to go down ﻿to the Lubyarka basement ﻿and into the execution cell. ﻿He found his predecessor ﻿Nikolai Yezhov there. ﻿He had admitted his crimes ﻿after being tortured, as was custom. ﻿Yezhov was probably worried ﻿about his daughter Natalia ﻿who he had adopted after ordering ﻿the killing of her Chekist parents. ﻿Six-year-old Natalia ﻿was now an orphan ﻿for a second time. ﻿The implacable Vasily Blokhin ﻿executed another former head ﻿of the NKVD ﻿watched by the new head. ﻿A month later, on March 1940, ﻿Beria's proposed No. 794/B ﻿sent to his comrade Stalin ﻿sealed the fate ﻿of the Polish officers. ﻿"They are enemies of the Soviet Union" ﻿"and are filled with hate for the Soviet system." ﻿ ﻿Beria suggested dealing with ﻿the execution of 14.700 Poles ﻿imprisoned in three monasteries, ﻿as well as that of 11.000 officers and civilians ﻿ ﻿held in Soviet Poland. ﻿"It's agreed" he concludes, ﻿"that the appropriate punishment" ﻿"should be death y shooting." ﻿As always, the execution request ﻿was approved by all members ﻿of the Politburo present ﻿and was signed by Stalin, ﻿Voroshilov, ﻿Molotov and Mikoyan. ﻿Two absent members, ﻿Kalinin and Kaganovich, ﻿gave their approval by phone. ﻿Nikita Khrushchev in Ukraine ﻿and could not be reached. ﻿The session was held ﻿at 2:10 in the morning. ﻿The norm. ﻿For the mission to go smoothly, ﻿the Poles had to think ﻿until the end ﻿that they would soon be released. ﻿From 5 April 1940, ﻿the POWs at Ostashkov monastery ﻿were gradually evacuated ﻿by windowless trains ﻿to Kalinin prison. ﻿Vasily Bolkhin awaited them there. ﻿This was disclosed only years later ﻿by the NKVD officer running the prison, ﻿ ﻿Dmitry Tokarev ﻿Testimony of Dimitry Tokarev recorded in 1992 ﻿"I was terrified when Blokhin, ﻿Siniegubov and Kriwienko" ﻿"came into my office" ﻿"and said:" ﻿"Come on then. ﻿Let's get to it!" ﻿"It was dangerous to refuse, ﻿so I agreed." ﻿"The door leading to the hall "﻿had been covered with felt" ﻿"to muff e the sounds of gunfire." ﻿"The prisoners went down the hall," "﻿turned left" ﻿"and into the "red" room." ﻿"In that room," ﻿"their identity was checked" ﻿"to avoid any errors." ﻿"Once certain" ﻿"it was the right person," "﻿they were handcuffed," "﻿and taken" ﻿"to the execution cell," ﻿"One of the doors ﻿of the execution cell" ﻿"led to a yard." ﻿"The bodies were taken out" ﻿"through this door" ﻿"and loaded on to trucks." ﻿"On the first night" ﻿"they executed 300 people." ﻿"But as the executions" ﻿"had to stop at dawn," ﻿"Blokhin gave orders" ﻿"to take prisoners" "i﻿n groups" ﻿"of a maximum of 250." ﻿There were executions every night ﻿until 22 May 1940. There was only one day of respite, May 1st, ﻿Labour Day. ﻿There were 6.287 executions ﻿at Kalinin. ﻿The POWs at Starobielsk monastery ﻿were taken by winndowless trains ﻿to the town of Kharkov. ﻿They were then taken ﻿to the NKVD prison ﻿where there were executions ﻿every night for six weeks. ﻿There were 3.896 executions ﻿at Kharkov. ﻿As for Kozielsk POWs, ﻿they were taken by windowless trains ﻿to the town of Smolensk. ﻿Then they were taken by truck to Katyn forest ﻿as retold by Andrzej Wajda ﻿whose father was murdered ﻿in Katyn forest. ﻿Some officers were taken to a dacha ﻿used as an NKVD rest house. ﻿But most were executed ﻿directly by the mass graves. ﻿Contrary to the other executions ﻿and for unknown reasons, ﻿the killings at Katyn were done ﻿out in the open in broad daylight. ﻿There were 4.404 executions. This was the Katyn Massacre. ﻿But this wasn't the full grim toll. ﻿The NKVD also deported ﻿officers and civilians arrested ﻿in Poland to prisons in Kiev, ﻿Kharkov and Minsk ﻿where they were executed. ﻿An additional 7.305 executions. ﻿In a month and a half ﻿the NKVD executed ﻿a total of 22.000 Polish officers ﻿and Polish nobility. ﻿Via the Top Secret order ﻿of 26 October 1940, ﻿Beria gave a reward ﻿of a month's salary ﻿to the NKVD agents ﻿that executed Poles. ﻿This order stated the killers' names ﻿including Vasily Blokhin, ﻿who oversaw the execution ﻿of the Ostashkov POWs ﻿along with Nikolai Siniegubov and Mikhail Kriwienko. ﻿The order also mentioned ﻿Fedor llyin, ﻿Iosif Gribov, ﻿Timofei Kupriy, ﻿Ivan Feldman, ﻿Ivan Stepanov. ﻿Two sets of brothers: ﻿Nikolai and Vladimir Kostyuchenko, ﻿and Ivan and Vasily Shigalev, ﻿two twisted alcoholics ﻿Blokhin kept an eye on. ﻿And there were two women: ﻿Serafima Kuznetsova ﻿and a Bulakhova, ﻿whose first name wasn't mentioned. ﻿A total of 40 Chekists ﻿executed 22.000 people in six weeks. ﻿This deserved nothing less ﻿than a bonus. ﻿But the NKVD's operation did not stop there. ﻿They had to erase all traces. ﻿Katyn" d'Andrzej Wajda (2007) ﻿"Das Massaker von Katyn" von Andrzej Wajda (2007) ﻿Take two. ﻿-	Yes, sir. ﻿-	Let's go, quick. ﻿Open up! ﻿-	Elzbieta Aleksandrowna? ﻿-	Yes. ﻿Wife of Polish Army officer ﻿Kazimierz Ignatowicz? ﻿-	Yes. ﻿-	Pack your things. ﻿In just two nights, ﻿entire families of the executed, ﻿some 60.000 people, ﻿were arrested and sent to the Gulag. ﻿Why is the girl crying? ﻿Don't cry! ﻿Don't you want to see your daddy? ﻿You're going to your husband. ﻿Barely deported, four officers' ﻿children wrote to the Kremlin. ﻿"Dear Stalin our Father," ﻿"we are writing to beg you ﻿to return our dads" ﻿"working in the Ostashkov camp." "﻿Life is hard for us now." ﻿"Our mothers aren't well ﻿and we're starving." ﻿"We are humbly asking you, ﻿Father Stalin, not to forget us." ﻿"We promise to be good Soviets," ﻿"yet it's hard to live ﻿without our dads." ﻿"Bye, Stalin our Father" ﻿This first wave ﻿of 60.000 arrests and deportations ﻿was followed ﻿by two much bigger waves. ﻿A total of one million Poles ﻿deemed "unsovietisable" were ﻿deported to Kazakhstan and Sibeia. ﻿They were met ﻿by thousands of Soviet peasants ﻿deported since 1930 ﻿who had no intention ﻿of helping them. ﻿Among the destitute, the first victims were ﻿youngest children. ﻿Jozef Czapski was part of the last ﻿transferred from Starobielsk. ﻿To his great surprise ﻿he wasn't released ﻿but taken to another NKVD monastery ﻿in Gryazovets. ﻿He joined 395 officers ﻿from the three monasteries, ﻿the only survivors of a mass murder ﻿to which they were obvivious. ﻿Salomon Slowes was also among ﻿the 395 who miraculously survived. ﻿They struck up a friendship. ﻿Neither of them understood ﻿why they weren't freed ﻿Like the rest of their comrades. ﻿So as not to go mad, ﻿Czapski held conferences ﻿on Marcel Proust. ﻿ ﻿Day after day with his comrades, ﻿he recited from memory ﻿the seven volumes ﻿of "In Search for Lost Time". ﻿It will never be known why ﻿the NKVD spared a handful of Poles. ﻿One can only assume ﻿that the Chekists ﻿considered that these men ﻿might come in handy one day. ﻿One year ater ﻿ ﻿A year later, a dramatic ﻿turn of events changed everytHng. ﻿Hitler terminated his pact ﻿with Stalin ﻿and invaded the USSR ﻿whose front was wiped out. ﻿The Red Army's collapse ﻿was so devastating ﻿that the world expected the Nazis ﻿to take Moscow in months. ﻿British Prime Minister ﻿Winston Churchill ﻿whose country was ﻿fighting alone against Hitler ﻿offered to provide the USSR ﻿with any help it needed. ﻿Churchill decided to draw a line under his profound anti-Communism ﻿and offered Stalin an alliance ﻿that the dictator in dire straits ﻿gladly accepted. ﻿But the UK was allied ﻿to Poland's government-in-exile ﻿run by Wladyslaw Sikorski ﻿who demanded all Poles ﻿deported to the Gulag be freed and that Poland's ﻿pre-1939 borders be restored. ﻿Churchill, determined ﻿to bring his allies together, ﻿invited Poland and the USSR ﻿to come to an agreement. ﻿Stalin represented by Ambassador Ivan Maisky, ﻿recognised the Polish government-in-exile. ﻿ ﻿The Poles deported to the USSR ﻿had to be released, ﻿or given amnesty in USSR terms. ﻿The most able formed an army ﻿of Poles in the USSR ﻿to fight the Nazis. ﻿But the agreement made no mention ﻿whatsoever of Poland's borders, ﻿with Stalin refusing ﻿to commit at the time. ﻿After some hesitation and pressure ﻿from Churchill, who asked him ﻿﻿to have faith in Stalin's sincerity, ﻿Sikorski signed the agreement. ﻿Totskye military camp, October 1941 ﻿ ﻿The Polish POWs began ﻿leaving the Gulag ﻿and were sent to Totskye camp ﻿on the edge of the Urals. ﻿Exhausted and starved, ﻿Soldiers and refugees ﻿had to throw together ﻿the new Polish Army. ﻿Winter 1941 came early. ﻿People were housed in tents with ﻿temperatures as low as -30 degrees. ﻿93.000 of them would die ﻿of exhaustion and illness ﻿the year after their release. ﻿The new Polish Army was formed ﻿and commanded ﻿by General Wladyslaw Anders. ﻿Captured in September 1939, ﻿General Anders languished ﻿for two years in the Lubyanka ﻿where he was often tortured. ﻿He was freed personally by Beria, ﻿who said to him: "﻿Let bygones be bygones." ﻿"Do yo want some tea ﻿or cigarettos?" ﻿Anders didn't need long ﻿to understand ﻿that he missed ﻿thousands of officers. ﻿Almost all his general staff ﻿from 1939 was now missing. ﻿Now released, ﻿Jozef Czapski and Salomon Slowes ﻿joined General Anders ﻿at Tokstoye camp ﻿and told him what they knew ﻿about the monastery evacuations. ﻿And the plot thickened. ﻿Had the POWs been handed over ﻿to the Germans, as Slowes suspected? ﻿Anders alerted Sikorski in London, ﻿but the International Red Cross ﻿assured him ﻿that no Polish POWs ﻿had been found in German camps. ﻿Anders deduced ﻿that his men were still in the USSR ﻿and demanded the Kremlin explain. ﻿The Kremlin responded via Molotov, ﻿who signed ﻿the officer's execution order, ﻿that the POWs had been freed ﻿as had been agreed. ﻿End of story. ﻿Moscow, December 1941 ﻿ ﻿But Sikorskii intended ﻿to shed light on ﻿the officer's disappearance ﻿and settle the matter ﻿of Poland and the USSR's borders. ﻿Sikorski was first seen by Kalinin, ﻿who had also signed ﻿the execution order. ﻿Kalinin assured Sikorski and Anders ﻿that he had no idea ﻿were the missing were. ﻿As for the borders, ﻿that was the boss's area. ﻿And the boss was in a good mood. ﻿"Let's not lock horns ﻿over a matter of borders," ﻿he declared to the Poles ﻿as he postponed ﻿talks on the issue. ﻿He was then confronted ﻿with the issue of missing officers. ﻿Stalin denied all knowledge of this ﻿but promised to ask Beria ﻿to find them. ﻿Urals, Totskoye Camp ﻿ ﻿But in reality Stalin wanted to get rid of the Poles ﻿by sending them to the front line ﻿with no training or equipment... ﻿Anders cateqorically refused. ﻿In retaliation, ﻿the USSR halved the rations ﻿Moreover, Anders had had enough ﻿of being strung along on the matter. ﻿In August 1942 ﻿he decided ﻿to relocate his army to Iran. ﻿He offered his services ﻿to the British troops there. ﻿General Anders told Jozef Czapski ﻿that he was sure the officers ﻿had been executed by the NKVD. ﻿But Czapski, obstinate, ﻿refused to believe it. ﻿Meanwhile, the USA had etered the war ﻿against Nazi Germany. ﻿The world's top economy ﻿had given a blank cheque ﻿to the war effort ﻿and devoted ﻿all its industrial capabilities. ﻿Stalin could now count ﻿on an additional ally ﻿and would soon benefit ﻿from the influx of US equipment. ﻿It was good timing as he was taking back control. ﻿The Soviet's tenacity surprised ﻿time and again the Nazis ﻿которые были вовлечены ﻿and known in ﻿their repugnant terminology ﻿as "Jewish Bolshevism". ﻿They exterminated Soviet Jews in mass ﻿and in unprecedented horror. ﻿ ﻿The Wehrmacht was also ordered ﻿to prey on this people, ﻿to be starved to death ﻿and replaced by German settlers. ﻿Driven by despair, ﻿the Soviet peasants formed ﻿resistance groups ﻿that constantly attacked ﻿the German rear. ﻿As for the NKVD, ﻿it reformed the Red Army ﻿in its own way. ﻿In line with an order from Stalin, ﻿Beria formed blocking units ﻿that executed those reluctant ﻿and deserters. ﻿It wasn't rare for Soviet soldiers ﻿to go into battle ﻿held at gunpoint by the NKVD ﻿to enforce Stalin's order: ﻿"Not a step back!" ﻿In February 1943, ﻿Red Army won ﻿decisive battle in Stalingrad. ﻿It was certain: ﻿the USSR was going ﻿to bring down Nazi Germany. ﻿The US, overcome with "Sovietmania", ﻿affectionately nicknamed Stalin ﻿"Uncle Joe". ﻿In the UK, he was almost ﻿as popular as Churchill. ﻿Faced for the first time with looming defeat, ﻿the Nazis tried behind the scenes ﻿to make peace with the US and UK, ﻿and why not obtain in the name of anti-Bolshevism ﻿their matherial support to push back the Red Army? ﻿Goebbels, minister of propaganda, ﻿deployed all possible means ﻿to rock the alliance ﻿between the US and UK and Stalin. ﻿And, soon, his services ﻿reported back to him ﻿with intelligence he believed ﻿would prove to the US and UK ﻿that the real danger ﻿was Jewish Bolshevism ﻿and its master, Stalin. ﻿Berlin, 13 April 1943 ﻿On 13 April 1943, ﻿Goebbels told the world ﻿that the German Army ﻿had discovered in Katyn Forest ﻿the bodies ﻿of the missing Polish officers, ﻿executed by the NKVD. ﻿"An odious Jewish Bolshevik crime," ﻿stated Goebbels, ﻿before revealing the names ﻿of those identified ﻿and the execution period: ﻿April 1940. ﻿Two days later, Moscow denouneed ﻿a German-Fascist lie ﻿and stated they were executed by the Nazis ﻿in July 1941. ﻿General Anders' Army ﻿ ﻿The German ravelation ﻿unlocked the mystery ﻿that had consumed ﻿Anders' men for two years. ﻿Jozef Czapski was devastated. ﻿Still, ﻿a haunting question remained: ﻿who had done it? ﻿Many soldiers wanted to believe ﻿the Soviet version. ﻿Katyn could be used ﻿in true Nazi style to manipulate. ﻿But could they really be certain? ﻿General Anders pressured Sikorski ﻿to hold urgently ﻿an independent investigation ﻿to put an end to the doubt. ﻿Sikorski was torn ﻿between his wish to know the truth ﻿and the need to handle Stalin ﻿so as to protect Poland's interests. ﻿But some officers ﻿identified by the Germans ﻿were the family of his ministers ﻿who also wanted to know the truth. ﻿ ﻿Sikorski was quickly summoned by Churchill ﻿to 10 Downing Street. ﻿The Prime Minister was ﻿extremely tense. ﻿﻿"We need your full support," ﻿said Sikorski. ﻿ ﻿"You know I'm behind Poland," ﻿replied Churchill. ﻿"It is perhaps true," ﻿Churchill continued, ﻿"but this is a trap set by Goebbels ﻿to pit us against Stalin." "﻿A luxury we cannot afford." ﻿Churchill said, ﻿"Be careful and realistic." ﻿"Do not publicly question ﻿Stalin's word." ﻿﻿"Too late," replied Sikorski, ﻿﻿"Stalin may not like it," ﻿"bu﻿t we have requested ﻿an investigation" ﻿﻿"by the Red Cross." ﻿The Polish request was ﻿a clear betrayal ﻿to the US and UK. ﻿What right did the bloody Poles have ﻿to doubt Stalin's good faith ﻿and contribute ﻿to Goebbels' conspiracies? ﻿A particularly furious editor ﻿would even write: ﻿"On the off chance the Poles ﻿were killed by the USSR," ﻿"then they deserved it!" ﻿And Roosevelt ﻿was sure that Stalin ﻿was not capable of such an atrocity. ﻿Far from being bothered ﻿by the Katyn find, ﻿Stalin saw it as an opportunity ﻿to get rid of the Polish government. ﻿And the USSR ﻿announced it was severing ﻿diplomatic ties ﻿with Sikorski's government, ﻿"a Hitier collaborator," ﻿declared Molotov. ﻿Roosevelt and Churchill, ﻿terrified ﻿Stalin would leave the alliance, ﻿could no longer support Sikorski. ﻿They had to settle the matter ﻿of Poland's borders ﻿without upsetting Stalin. ﻿Katyn was a crime scene ﻿under Nazi control. ﻿Polish medical examiner Marian Wodzinski, 01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,319 head of Cracow Institute of Forensic Medicine 01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,519 ﻿was appointed ﻿by Sikorski's government in London ﻿to accompany the Polish Red Cross ﻿at Katyn. ﻿"It was 9:30 am," ﻿Wodzinski recalled. ﻿"Despite the cold, an awful odour ﻿made the air unbreathable." ﻿"Then suddenly, we saw the bodies ﻿in No.1 mass grave." ﻿"The Germans had left several layers ﻿of bodies clearly visible." ﻿"We were speechless." ﻿"After retracing our steps." ﻿"we sat in silence all morning ﻿to recollect ourselves." ﻿"The only way to find the culprit," ﻿said Wodzinski, ﻿"was to determine the date ﻿of the killings." ﻿The Polish team got to work. ﻿The bodies were exhumed ﻿by Russian POWs. ﻿The bodies were so packed down, ﻿they were difficult to separate ﻿without damaging. ﻿The upper layers were moulded ﻿together into a fatty block, ﻿showing that the bodies ﻿had not been moved ﻿since being buried. ﻿Each body was searched. ﻿Personal papers, cards ﻿and newspapers were sent to a cabin ﻿where a German team recorded ﻿and translated then ﻿"We could access them," ﻿recalled Marian Wodzinski, ﻿"even though the Germans ﻿wanted them as evidence." ﻿"No document was dated" ﻿"after 20 April 1940." ﻿Many officer's hands had been tied ﻿and many showed bayonet wounds ﻿on their arms and legs. ﻿"The tied hands and bayonet wounds", ﻿noted Wodzinski, ﻿"showed that certain victims ﻿had put up a fight." ﻿The bodies had different uniforms. ﻿There were no signs of insects ﻿on the bodies or the clothes. ﻿This meant it had happened ﻿during the cold season ﻿and not during summer 1941 ﻿as the Soviets had stated. ﻿It soon became clear ﻿that all the executions ﻿had been done with 7.65 mm bullets ﻿ ﻿made in Germany ﻿and used exclusively ﻿with German pistols ﻿made by Walther. ﻿ ﻿"This discovery," ﻿recalled Dr Wodzinski, ﻿"had dumbfounded the Germans" ﻿"who had no idea ﻿how this could be possible." ﻿When Goebbels heard, ﻿he was appalled and ordered: ﻿dass sie absolut geheim bleibt..." ﻿meaning it must remain secret. ﻿But being impossible to conceal, ﻿the Wehrmacht covered its back ﻿by revealing that Germany had sold ﻿a large amount of Walther pistols ﻿to the USSR in the 1930s. ﻿To create ﻿the illusion of impartiality, ﻿Goebbels decided to gather ﻿best medical examiners ﻿from 12 German-controlled countries. ﻿They arrived at Katyn ﻿on 30 April 1943. ﻿Professor Orsos from Budapest ﻿interrogated in Russian locals living nearby, 01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,039 selected by the Nazis ﻿and who claimed to have heard ﻿the sound of non-stop gunfire i﻿n spring 1940. ﻿Some said they had seen ﻿Polish officers ﻿get off windowless trains ﻿at the small Gniezdowo station ﻿and taken by the NKVD towards Katyn. ﻿According to witnesses, it had been ﻿a common execution site ﻿fort the Cheka since 1918. ﻿Even if it sounded ﻿like a recitation, ﻿this last statement ﻿was confirmed ﻿by No.8 to No.11 Graves. ﻿They held older remains ﻿of murdered civilians ﻿shot in the head. "﻿Professor Orsos," ﻿recalled Marian Wodzinski, ﻿"conducted a thorough autopsy ﻿that I attended." ﻿"He focused on the skull" ﻿"to determine the burial time" ﻿"by the number of layers ﻿of calcium deposits inside." ﻿"I agreed with him," ﻿Wodzinski stated. ﻿"They were buried ﻿three years earlier." ﻿"The only truly neutral ﻿medical examiner," ﻿"the Swiss Professor Naville," recalled Wodzinski, ﻿"focused on the vegetation next to graves." ﻿ ﻿1197 01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,399 ﻿"Young pines had been planted ﻿on the mass graves." ﻿"A cross-cut revealed ﻿it had been done three years earlier" ﻿"durng 1940." ﻿Marian Wodzinski ﻿and the other medical examiners ﻿had no doubt about the crime period ﻿given so much reliable evidence: ﻿April 1940. ﻿It could only be a Soviet crime. ﻿Marian Wodzinski spent ﻿five weeks at Katyn ﻿to try to identify ﻿as many victims as possible. ﻿Among them he would identify ﻿two of his best friends. ﻿Out of the 700 autopsies he did, ﻿he noted an astounding consistency ﻿in the gunshot wounds. ﻿Only two per cent of shots ﻿required a second attempt. ﻿The killers were ﻿surprisingly experienced ﻿with precise and repetitive actions. ﻿Seventy per cent of the 4.400 bodies ﻿were identifed ﻿and numbered before being reburied. ﻿All the victims were exclusively from Kozielsk monastery. ﻿The fate of those ﻿from Ostashkov and Starobielsk ﻿rermained a total mystery. ﻿On 7 June 1943, ﻿the work of Marian Wodzinski ﻿and the Red Cross ﻿had to be definitively stopped. ﻿The Nazis were losing Smolensk ﻿and in just a few weeks ﻿Katyn would once again ﻿be in Soviet hands. ﻿Wodzinski passed his findings ﻿on to the Polish resistance, ﻿which sent them to London. ﻿In July 1943 ﻿the Foreign Office gave Churchill ﻿a top secret report ﻿that concluded ﻿that Katyn was a Soviet crime. ﻿Churchill passed the report ﻿on to Rossevelt, ﻿adding the comment: "﻿Here are the facts." ﻿"We must never speak of this" ﻿"Katyn is of no practical use." ﻿"Please send this back to me ﻿after reading it." ﻿Iran, December 1943 ﻿"On the way to Tehran." ﻿"Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt ﻿plus their staffs all came by air," ﻿"Soviet's great leader going abroad ﻿for the first time in over 30 years." ﻿Soviet Union Embassy in Tehran Upon arriving Stalin was seething against Churchill and Roosevelt, ﻿who still hadn't sent ﻿troops to Europe. ﻿And he learned ﻿it wouldn't happen any time soon. ﻿Another reason to please him ﻿regarding Poland. ﻿Churchill proposed a solution. ﻿The British PM laid three matches on the table, ﻿representing Poland. ﻿He took the match on the right ﻿and placed it on the left, ﻿representing a shift west of the Polish territory. ﻿Stalin would keep his 1939 conquest ﻿and, to compensate, Poland would get ﻿part of the German territory. ﻿Stalin agreed. ﻿Millions of Poles and Germans ﻿had to be relocated ﻿but as Stalin said: ﻿"Nationalities are just a matter of transport." ﻿Roosevelt simply asked Stalin ﻿to keep the pact secret ﻿until the US Presidential Elections ﻿in 1944, ﻿so as not to lose the vote ﻿of the Polish community. ﻿First surprised ﻿by this democratic subtlety, ﻿Stalin gladly agreed ﻿to do the US president this favour. ﻿Katyn, January 1944 ﻿ ﻿"In January 1944 ﻿the Soviet government returned" ﻿"to the tragic Katyn Forest scene ﻿near Smolensk." ﻿The Katyn bodies were ﻿once again exhumed ﻿and autopsies performed ﻿by an all-Soviet expert panel, ﻿﻿which concluded that the Poles ﻿had been executed in 1941 ﻿while the area was ﻿under German control. ﻿"The executions were carried out ﻿by Hitier sympathisers." "﻿Each officer was shot in the head." ﻿"A hallmark of Fascist executioners." ﻿The witnesses confirmed ﻿they talked under Gestapo duress ﻿and recanted their statements. ﻿While Nazis returned to Berlin ﻿with all the documents from Katyn, ﻿the NKVD presented new evidence: ﻿"Several documents found at the site" ﻿"were dated after 1940." ﻿"Here is a letter from an officer" ﻿"addressed to his family ﻿and dated 20 June 1941." ﻿"And Goebbels said the Poles ﻿were executed in 1940!" ﻿"Another letter was dated" "﻿September 1941." ﻿The NKVD managed to sow ﻿seeds of doubt an﻿d confusion ﻿among sceptical Western observers ﻿at the site. ﻿Katyn appeared to be a Nazi crime. ﻿Nazi Germany surrendered ﻿Poland ﻿The war was over and, as agreed, ﻿Polish borders shifted west. Stalin appointed a Communist leader, Boleslaw Bierut,﻿ ﻿that the Poles quickly nicknamed "Little Stalin". ﻿The Chekists terrorised the people ﻿and eliminated any who opposed ﻿the Communist Party. ﻿No Pole dared speak ﻿of the Katyn Massacre ﻿for fear of being arrested ﻿or worse... ﻿At the Nuremberg Trials, ﻿the Soviet prosecutor maintained ﻿that Katyn was a Nazi crime ﻿to achieve recognition ﻿from the world ﻿of the USSR version of events. ﻿But the judges deemed the evidence ﻿presented by Moscow insufficient. ﻿The court refused to rule ﻿on the Katyn affair! ﻿In international law, ﻿Katyn remained a mass crime ﻿with no ruling or conviction. ﻿A huge setback for the USSR ﻿which showed that their version ﻿was very weak. ﻿..IP I ﻿Mr Czapski, do you object ﻿to being photographed? ﻿- No. ﻿- No objection to photographs. ﻿In true McCarthyism, ﻿the House of Representatives ﻿formed a committee ﻿to investigate Katyn. ﻿A political refugee in France, ﻿Jozef Czapski was called ﻿to give evidence ﻿and gave a long deposition ﻿at the end of which, ﻿the president asked: ﻿To say who, what government, ﻿is responsible for the massacre ﻿at Katyn in your opinion. ﻿First of all, there ﻿no doubt in my mind ﻿that these men were murdered ﻿by the Soviets. ﻿Thank you for your testimony. ﻿I must state my second point. ﻿Secondly, ﻿we keep forgetting that Russia is ﻿the most central country ﻿in the world ﻿whenever it comes to issuing ﻿orders or directives or policy ﻿Full responsibility of this crime ﻿does not rest with some NKVD sadists ﻿but it rests with Beria and Stalin. ﻿I want to thank you ﻿for testifying here today. ﻿The Select Committee found ﻿the USSR guilty. ﻿This finding still lacked proof. ﻿The White House and CIA ﻿refused to release ﻿classified information. ﻿As the Cold War raged, ﻿neither Washington ﻿nor London wanted to provoke ﻿Stalin over Katyn unnecessarily. ﻿Moscow ﻿March 1953 ﻿ ﻿With Stalin dead, Poland's surviving ﻿officers and the victims' families ﻿had hopes that the truth ﻿would come out about Katyn. ﻿As for the Politburo members, ﻿they were both relieved, ﻿with Stalin's tyranny and paranoia ﻿in the final years ﻿sowing terror among them, ﻿and also concerned for their own lives. ﻿Head of the Chekists for 15 years, ﻿Beria cunningly escaped ﻿Stalin's wrath. ﻿Chief of home and foreign security, ﻿with incriminating files ﻿on the entire Politburo, ﻿he already acted ﻿as he was the new boss. ﻿But Stalin's other henchmen ﻿were scheming against him ﻿and ordered his arrest. ﻿Lavrentiy Beria was shot in the head ﻿on 23 December 1953. ﻿The Chekist tradition ﻿had been upheld. ﻿For the new boss, Nikita Khrushchev, ﻿Katyn was a delicate state secret ﻿ ﻿that had to be kept at all cost. ﻿In 1959, ﻿Alexander Shelepin, Beria's successor, ﻿proposed in a top secret letter ﻿addressed to Khrushchev ﻿to destroy every single document ﻿of the 21.857 Poles ﻿executed by the NKVD in April 1940. ﻿"These documents," ﻿wrote the KGB boss ﻿"could one day bring ﻿this operation to light," ﻿"and cause undesirable consequences ﻿for our country." ﻿Nobody knows if Nikita Khrushchev ﻿authorised ﻿the evidence's destruction. ﻿Moscow 1964 ﻿In 1964, Khrushchev's successor ﻿Leonid Brezhnev inherited the secret. ﻿Like any good propagandist, ﻿he decided to put up a smokescreen. ﻿He established ﻿an annual memorial day ﻿for the Khatyn Massacre ﻿with an "H", ﻿A small village in Belarus ﻿whose inhabitants were burned ﻿alive by the Nazis. ﻿Brezhnev invited President Nixon ﻿who officially visited ﻿the memorial in 1974. ﻿In response the Poles in exile in London ﻿decided to build ﻿a memorial in the UK capital ﻿sombrely named "Katyn 1940". ﻿The reference to 1940 ﻿aroused the wrath of Brezhnev ﻿who warned the UK ﻿to prevent this "provocation", ﻿But the UK government, ﻿despite its best efforts, ﻿was unable to stop ﻿the construction of the memorial ﻿unveiled in 1976. ﻿One of Churchill's grandsons, ﻿a Common's minister, ﻿placed a wreath ﻿on behalf of his family ﻿yet the opening ceremony was ﻿largely glossed over ﻿by the British media. ﻿Gdansk, 1980 ﻿In 1980, the Solidarność trade union ﻿led a major uprising ﻿against the Polish Communist regime ﻿that was on the brink of collapse. ﻿Genera Jaruzelski came out ﻿of the woodwork. ﻿Jaruzelski was just a child when, like a million fellow Poles, ﻿he was deported to Siberia. ﻿He often wore dark sunglasses ﻿after suffering snow blindness. ﻿He was trained ﻿at a Soviet officer school. ﻿With unfaltering dedication ﻿to Moscow, ﻿he became ﻿head of the Polish regime. ﻿He proclaimed martial law ﻿and imprisoned the leaders ﻿of Solidarność. ﻿Moscow 1985 ﻿In 1985 ﻿Mikhai Gorbachev became ﻿the new Soviet leader ﻿and tried with all his energy ﻿to reform the Soviet Union. ﻿Two years later, ﻿before an official visit to Poland, Gorbatchev asked to see the classified documents 01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:23,879 related to Katyn and the 1940 Polish operation. ﻿After reading the files signed ﻿47 years earlier by the Politburo, ﻿Mikhai Gorbachev replaced the seals ﻿and ordered the affair ﻿to be buried once again. ﻿Warsaw, 1988 ﻿In 1988 ﻿new strikes led by Solidarność ﻿ended in violence ﻿and the situation was no longer ﻿under control. ﻿In February 1989 ﻿Jaruzelski agreed to hold talks. ﻿18 June 1989 On 18 June, after the election, ﻿partly opened to parties ﻿other than the Communists, ﻿rejection of the regime ﻿was so apparent ﻿that Jaruzelski had no choice ﻿but to call on a Solidarność leader, ﻿Tadeusz Mazowiecki, ﻿who became the first prime minister ﻿that was non-communist ﻿in Eastern Europe. ﻿Some weeks later, ﻿pressured by the people, ﻿Jaruzelski gave Gorbachev ﻿an ultimatum: ﻿he would cancel ﻿his official visit to Moscow ﻿if the Kremlin didn't admit ﻿the truth about Katyn. ﻿This blackmail would have meant ﻿his sectioning under Brezhnev ﻿and his murder under Stalin ﻿but Gorbachev promised ﻿to release some information ﻿in the hope ﻿Jaruzelski wouldn't cancel. ﻿Gorbachev was in fact himself ﻿losing his grip on the Soviet Union, ﻿torn between ﻿the Party's progressives ﻿demanding more reforms ﻿and the conservators ﻿wanting to end it all. ﻿In this chaotic context, ﻿Soviet academics ﻿went as far as publishing ﻿in the official press ﻿an article attributing ﻿Katyn war crime to the NKVD. ﻿Katyn was now an open secret ﻿that the Soviet government, ﻿on its last legs, ﻿could no longer protect. ﻿On 13 Apr 1990 ﻿Moscow acknowledged ﻿the Katyn Massacre ﻿via a simple press release ﻿that put the blame on Beria ﻿and absolved the Soviet Union ﻿of all responsibility. ﻿Not until the collapse ﻿of the Soviet Union ﻿would the Russian President ﻿Boris Yeltsin ﻿make the secret order public, ﻿which clearly showed ﻿that the USSR was guilty. ﻿Finally, the last secret, ﻿the burial sites of the Ostashkov ﻿and Starobielsk victims ﻿were revealed. ﻿Those from Ostashkov were buried ﻿in the Mednoye village mass graves nearby Tver city. ﻿Those from Starobielsk were buried ﻿in Ukraine's Pyatykhatky mass grave. ﻿Just next to a recreational area ﻿for KGB staff and their children. ﻿﻿He wasn't shooting, ﻿he was working." ﻿Vladimir Zazubrin, 'The Chekist', 1923 ﻿
