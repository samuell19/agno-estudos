I guess I wasn't really workin' steadily before that either but, I mean I, I was but not the kinda thing you put on a resume unfortunately. But I was trying to make a good resume, but it's, you know what I mean like, it's a lot of stuff that, and it's really inconsistent so I'm not really that good at the resume thing, so maybe, you know, and I don't, not to say, but just for your own so you know what you're maybe looking at, and so that's why I'm looking at you and it makes me nervous. Yeah, see, it makes me nervous. I'm not really good at that. I just want to say that I don't have a lot of other obligations so, you know. And I have a phone so, you can get ahold of me anytime. But it's, it's pay as you go so, if I can't pay then [chuckles]. - I did three hours of charting yesterday. - Ugh, charting. Charting sucks. - I shoulda gave a sermon.

[steak sizzling] [Iris laughs] [steak sizzling] [gentle piano music] [wine sloshing] [gentle piano music] [glasses clinking] [gentle piano music] So, how'd I do? - Eh. - I figured that [throat clearing], you know, you're cookin' for me all the time. Least I can do is return the favor. - Okay. It's amazing. [Bobby laughs] [Iris sighs] Do you remember uh [laughs], when we didn't have anywhere to go and we used to go make out in the car by the waterfront [laughs]? - Oh yeah. [Iris laughs] And we broke the back of the Toyota. - [Iris] That was your fault. - Oh yeah, 'cause I can do that all by myself. - Oh, I plead guilty. - Oh yeah [laughs]. - Oh, I'm sorry. - [Bobby] You plead guilty [laughs]. - But we should, we should go back there sometime. I wonder if it's changed at all. - No, it hasn't. [food munching] - You've been there? [food munching] - Sure. Yeah, I mean, I go down there sometimes just to check it out. [Bobby's throat clearing] Not much different. And it's, it's a good place to chill when I'm stressed. [tense music] Reminds me of us. - Well, maybe we should go there together again someday.

Okay? I need you to be present with me. Focus. Need the man in you. - Alright, dick. [Terry laughs] - Alright, let's go. First we're stoppin' to get some fuckin' tacos. [Bobby laughs] [bus engine whirring] [truck beeping] [rock music] - Oh, I'm sorry. $6.75 for a bag of chips. All you gotta do is slap duty free on there right? [rock music] Iris? Hey, hey.

[gravel crunching] [pills rattling] [dog barking] - Ride's here. - [Terry] Let's go. [dog barking] [door slams] - Hey. Alright, I'll take him. [dog barking] [door unlatching] [door slams] [traffic whirring] - Boom mother fucker. We got him. That was a good bust. - So what's next? - FIll in some paperwork and call it a day. - You wanna grab a drink? - I do and I will but not with you. I gotta go solo. Rain check? - Yeah. - Alright. [traffic whirring] - [Waitress] There you go sir. And there you go miss. [cup thuds] Enjoy. [slurping] - It's good tea. [cups thuds] In fact, the first thing I did when I got out was get myself a cup of this. [dishes clattering] So how's things? How's life? [dishes clattering] What are you doin'? Are you workin'? - I work at a hospital. - [Lloyd] Really? What do you do there? - I'm a CNA. - A CNA? That's really good. I'm proud of you. Hey is that, are you married? [restaurant patrons chattering] - Yeah. - Wow. I guess that's another thing I missed. I'm sorry. How's it goin'? - [Bobby] Give it back! - No! No! You drove home drunk. You've been doing this shit lately. I'm afraid they're gonna take your badge away from you. Bobby stop it! Stop! Stop! [hand slaps] [Iris gasping] It's great. - Good. Well I'm happy for ya. I guess I owe you a wedding present huh? [chuckles] I'm doin' good. I got out early and uh, I've been clean for nearly four years. I got a job already. I feel good. I mean it's... [dishes clattering] [patrons chattering] Oh honey I, I wanted to see you again 'cause I wanted to, we haven't spoken in five years. I, I just wanted to finally talk about things with you. - Well, I don't really know what you want me to say. - Well, whatever you wanna say, whatever you wanna talk about. - I really don't have anything to say to you. - I think you do [laughs]. I know that silent treatment. - Yeah you, you don't really know anything about me. - I didn't mean it that way. - You had so many chances to be a dad. Every time I let you in you'd I don't know, just kinda throw it right back in my face. 15 years old, living with a foster parent. They finally let me live with you and what happens? Busted. You weren't there when mom got sick. You weren't there when she died. So I guess I really don't have any idea what it is that you wanna talk about. [dishes clattering] - When I was in prison I had a friend named Mark Huel. He was a guy a lot like me. He'd done a lot of stupid things, but when he got out of prison, he got to put his arms around his 10 year old little girl who was waiting outside. I didn't have that because I didn't deserve it. I didn't earn it. I let my daughter grow up without the, the attention she deserved from me. I don't know what I was thinkin', what I was doin'. I just, I fucked up so many things in both of our lives and I was, I've been a shitty dad. I know that. And I can't expect you to forgive me but I'm hopin' that someday you do. Well, listen, listen. If you want me in your life I'm here and if you don't I'll be around if you ever decide you do 'cause I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm here for you and I'm not sure about anything more then how sorry I am for all the things that I've done, and all the shit that I haven't done that I should've. [dishes clattering] [patrons chattering] [Iris sighs] [dishes clattering] [patrons chattering] [Lloyd sighs] [dishes clattering] - I don't trust you. - Iris? [footsteps receding] [Lloyd exhales] - Great work today man. Let's celebrate another time. Sounds good. [door unlatching] [door slams] [engine starting] [engine revving] [door unlatching] [door slams] [Iris sighs] [bottles thudding] [cap clattering] [liquid sloshing] [door unlatching] [Iris gasps] [door slams] [bottles thudding] Hey. - [Iris] You're home early. - Yeah we got the guy so they let me out early. - [Iris] Good, I was just about to make dinner. - Where is it? I had a bottle of Jack right here, where is it? Oh, it's in the sink. Great, did you just do that? - I just wanted a night without it, okay? - Well [scoffs], that's really shitty Iris. Really shitty. - [Iris] I'm sorry. - Yeah, it ain't cheap. But hey it's, it's okay 'cause I got a backup. [liquid sloshing] [door clattering] You forgot this one. - Come on. You don't need that. We had a good night last night. - Yeah, I guess you got low standards. - You know I don't care about that. You know baby, you've got the magic hands. We'll get the rest back. - Jesus. Just drop it. Okay? - I had a lot of fun last night. It's pretty apparent that the feeling wasn't mutual so will you please just talk to me. Is there something that we can do, that I can do? - I said drop it. What part of that don't you understand? - Stressing about it isn't gonna make it any better. That isn't gonna help either. You think Terry would be impressed with you like this? - Yeah. That guy, he doesn't give a shit. - Fine. Let's both get wasted. [liquid sloshing] [cupboard clattering] - Fuck! [hand slaps] [picture thuds] [glass shattering] [Bobby grunting] [footsteps receding] [somber music] [Iris sobbing] [somber music] [Lloyd sighs] - That's a crappy leave, but I'm gonna have to say side pocket off the rail. - What? [patrons chattering] Oh come on! What, you got fuckin' pool tables in prison? - I just can't afford to lose. - Oh. - Gotta go buy another round, I'm sorry. - Alright, alright. - Come back and rack these things. [patrons chattering] [Lloyd sighs] - Lloyd? Lloyd? - Oh hey, yeah Jason right? - Hey. How's it goin' man? - Long time no see. - Hey, where you've been? - Away. - Yeah? - Hey, hey man I don't do that anymore. - No? - No. - Come on man, I can't find Oggy anywhere. You're it. - No, no I told you I'm out of the game okay? - Come on man, don't, don't break my balls. I was just getting used to it. - Hey, I want you to forget that you know me alright? [patrons chattering] Hey. - Here you go stud. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. [glass thuds] Who was that? - Old client actually. - Oh. - Yeah. [patrons chattering] - You're a good man Lloyd, you know that right? - You're in a very small minority of people who think that. [Nathan chuckles] But you know all the shitty things I've done. I'm just gonna have to pay for that until the day I die but you reap what you sow and unfortunately, that's what I've sewn. [patrons chattering] - But you never stopped lovin' Iris. [Lloyd sighs] And she knows that. - You think so? [gentle music] - She'll come around. She will. Look, you're her dad. That counts for somethin'. I know girls need their dads. That's what I know. [Lloyd chuckles] [glasses clinking] [inhales] [exhales] [phone ringing] - [Angie] Hello, what's up? - Hey Angie, how's it goin'? - [Angie] Oh, livin' the dream. How 'bout you? - I'm alright. Um, can you uh, would you mind just covering my shift for me today? - [Angie] Oh, sure yeah if you need me to. I'll figure it out. Okay. [Iris sighs] - Thank you. - [Angie] No problem. You sure you're alright? - Yeah no, I just um, I just don't feel good. - [Angie] Okay well, just rest up today. Take it easy. - Thank you. I'll uh, yeah, I'll do that. - [Angie] Okay. - Uh, I'll catch up with you later. - [Angie] Alright, hang in there. - Okay. - [Angie] Alright, bye. - Bye. [tense music] [Iris sighing] [tense music] [phone ringing] - [Lloyd] Hi. - Dad? [lid clattering] [bottle thuds] [sighs] [knocking] [Iris sighs] - [Lloyd] Hey. - Hey, come on in. - Well, it's really nice. I'd love to get my own place. It's gonna be awhile. I'm stayin' with Nathan. I, I told you that already but, anyway he says I can stay as long as I want but... Hey, thanks. - [Iris] Yeah, yeah. [Lloyd chuckles] [glass thuds] So what's up? - Um, I just... - What is that? - Nothing. - [Lloyd] How'd that happen? - Don't. - [Lloyd] Did somebody do that to you? - No, no one did. [Iris sighs] - [Lloyd] Oh Iris, look at this. - You know what? It's not your problem, okay? So just let it go. - [Lloyd] Is this what you meant when you said it was going good? [Iris sighs] - What? It was just a fight. You never fought with mom? - I never did anything like that to your mother or any other woman. Any guy who does is a piece of shit. And this guy's your husband? - You don't even know him okay? You know what forget it. I did not call you over here for this. If this is what you want you can just get out. - Okay hey? I'm sorry. Okay? Can you, can you sit down? I'm sorry. Can you sit please? Come on sit down. - I'm sorry. - [Lloyd] You're askin' a lot of me to not be upset when I hear somebody's hitting my daughter. - I know, I'm sorry it just, it's not, it's really not what it looks like okay? It's just this weird rough patch. It's not a big deal okay? - That's not a big deal? Don't be, it concerns me that you said that. Alright, then why did you call me over here? I think you called me because you want my help with this. - I don't need you to do anything. I just thought that, [sighs] I don't know. [Iris sighs] I don't know, just like keep me company. Don't try to go all super dad on me right now okay? - Okay. I won't do anything. I mean, could I at least talk with him? Could I, could I meet my son-in-law? - He's on duty. - He's on [smirks]... That's funny 'cause that sounds like he's a cop. - Yeah [smirks]. - [Lloyd] I like him already. [tense music] [phone ringing] [tense music] - [Operator] Please leave your message.

I don't know what that is. - Uh huh. - [Iris] Dad? - Oh no, hey I've seen all I need to see. - [Iris] Dad, I beg you don't do that. - Okay. You know what? I'm sorry but I kind wanna know what good that guy has ever done 'cause the only man I'm seein' is kind of an asshole. - Because he's always been there. He's always been there. - Okay, yeah. That's the most solid thing you've had in your life and uh, you're fighting for it. I get that. [Lloyd sighs] Look, let me try to talk to him okay? No listen, you guys can't seem to talk and you say he's not like this so obviously something is wrong. Very fuckin' wrong. Maybe I can help. I mean... No please. Just let me give it a shot. I, I don't think it'll hurt anything. Let me try, okay? Okay. You know where I can find him? [patrons chattering] - Can I get another? [patrons chattering] - Hey. - Jesus Christ, leave me alone. [patrons chattering] - Just calm down okay? Can I get a Wild Bourbon rocks? [patrons chattering] - You guys really look like you could use a drink. [patrons chattering] - Yeah I don't know why they put straws in it right? Without mixin' anything it's a straight drink. [patrons chattering] So can we talk? [patrons chattering] No? [patrons chattering] [patron whistles] Look, you're my son-in-law, I'm your father-in-law. We didn't have a choice about that but I'd like to get to know you a little bit. Maybe you could just humor me? [patrons chattering] [cocktail shaker sloshing] Iris has told me about me. - You don't know shit. - Actually I do know some shit and I gotta tell ya, I don't like some of the shit that I know. - Yeah, just fuck off man. - Hey just hear me out. - No. I came here to be alone, okay? You guys kicked me out and now you're comin' to me? What the fuck do you want? - I wanna help you man. I just wanna help you with whatever it is that you guys are goin' through, and I don't really care if you want me to or not because I'm here for my daughter. [patrons chattering] Bobby come on man. [patrons chattering] Come on Bobby, let me get you a cab. - Don't need it. - I can't let you drive like this. - Fuck off. You're not my dad. - Well whether or not you wanna except it or not we're family now. - Give me a fuckin' break, really? What the fuck do you know about family? Huh? Do you know what Iris told me when I first asked about you? She said you were fuckin' dead. That's what she thinks of you. - Oh, she probably did. Uh, that's maybe what she thought about me you know, but I think we're past that now. [Bobby laughs] - Good for you. Now you're just tryin' to make her hate me instead. - Oh come on, how would that benefit me? [keys jingling] Look, I'm not lettin' you drive. [door slams] You're not drivin'. Look just stop. - Fuck! - [Lloyd] Hey, come on. - Fuck off! - [Lloyd] Hey, come on. - Fuck off! Fuck! - Just stop it man. - Fuck off! [dumpster clanging] [Bobby grunting] I can squeeze tighter. You want me to squeeze tighter? Huh? [Bobby groaning] Alright you had enough? Alright stop movin! Stop movin' and I'll let you go. You stop movin'. Stop movin'. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Okay. [Bobby gasping] [Bobby coughing] [Lloyd panting] - Fuck. [Lloyd panting] Jesus, this is not what I wanted okay? I mean it when I said I wanna help you. If you think Iris kicked you out because she doesn't love you, that's wrong. Iris totally loves you but she realizes you got some shit to work on, okay? [Lloyd gasping] You wanna work on that? Huh? [Lloyd gasping] Look, I don't know what the fuck you're goin' through, but you can't do that shit to Iris. You understand? A man doesn't do that to his wife. Plain and simple. A man does not do that to-- - I know, I know! Fuck I know! - I hope you fuckin' know. [Lloyd gasping] Look, [Lloyd gasping] you just stay away from her 'til you can control yourself. You understand me? [Lloyd gasping] You got that? Okay. Okay. [hang patting] [Lloyd gasping] Okay we're okay. You okay? You alright? Okay. [Lloyd gasping] Fuck [gasping]. I'm sorry that got a little rough. Let's, let's just, let's go back inside there. We're gonna get a bite and soak up that alcohol. Come on. We'll get past this. You and me. Alright, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on Bobby. [keys jingling] [Bobby grunts] [engine starts] Come on. [gravel crunching] [Lloyd gasping] - God damn it dad, what the hell? - Baby, he was throwin' punches. I didn't know what else to do okay? Jesus I didn't wanna tell you, but I knew that if I didn't tell you when you found out from him you'd be so mad. Look, I, I don't think it made it worse. I don't. I don't. [Iris sighs] I believe you when you say it's bene good up 'til now. I wouldn't know, I just got here. I just... - It's never been like this. - Yeah, and it can't ever be like that. [Iris sighs] But somethin' is definitely wrong. He needs help. - 'Kay. - You know what? I, [sighs] I'm hopeful that it's gonna be okay. Okay? [Iris sighs] I believe that, I believe it is. [tense music] [glass thuds] [ice clattering] [tense music] [ice thudding] [tense music] [liquid sloshing] [tense music] [slurping] [Bobby grunts] - I spilled some. - I can see that. [water splashing] [Bobby grunts] You went to see her again didn't you? Dude, if she wants space fucking give it to her. Okay? The sooner you do the sooner you'll be able to go home [laughs]. [Bobby sighs] - It's not because of that. It's not just that. I fuckin' fuck things up Terry. I fucked 'em up beyond repair. - Look, I'll be real with you. You're a good guy. Everyone knows that. [Bobby scoffs] But you gotta let whatever happens happen. Stop forcing things. And if it doesn't work out for whatever reason, then ce la vie buddy. Life goes on. You just gotta keep movin' and improvin'. But hey, you'll always have me. I love you Bobby G. [Terry grunting] [Terry spits] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What the? - You didn't uh, well I didn't mean to. I thought-- - You just fuckin' kissed me. - I didn't mean to you... - I, dude I know I said that I love you but... - Fuck! I'm not, fuck! - [Terry] Jesus. - I'm just a little bit confused right now. [laughs] - You're confused? Oh fuck. [door slams] [sighs] Fuck! [hand slaps] [tense music] [phone ringing] - Bobby? - [Bobby] Iris? I'm sorry but I couldn't, but you don't know what I am. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. I did love you Iris, I did. Goodbye. [tense music] [Lloyd snoring] [door unlatching] - Hey, hey, where you goin'? - Bobby called me, I have to go. It's okay, go back to bed, it's early. [Lloyd grunts] - What'd he say? - I don't know but, something's wrong. - He's probably still upset about last night and hung over. - No dad, I'm worried. [tense music] - Alright. I'm comin', I'm comin'. [belt rustling] [gentle music] [knocking] [Terry sighs] [door unlatching] - Oh, hey. - Hey. If you're lookin' for your man he's not here. [Iris sighs] - Do you know where he is? - Your guess is as good as mine. Everything alright? - Uh, I dunno. - Hey? Can we talk inside for a sec? - Uh, yeah okay. [door latching] - Um, Bobby's been acting a little strange lately right? - Yeah. - Um, is he uh, I'm just gonna say it. Um, is Bobby gay? - What? - Look, is he into dudes? - No. - 'Kay, this is awkward. Um, last night Bobby kissed me. Like on the lips. Yeah, weird right? I mean he, I felt bad 'cause he was like crying and shit and I've just never seen him like that. I didn't wanna upset you, I just thought you should know 'cause I know you guys are goin' through a rough patch or whatever, but maybe that explains something. - Thank you for telling me. - Do you want me to talk to him? I can kick him straight [laughs]. [Iris scoffs] - No, you really don't know where he is? It's important. - I have no idea. [Iris sighs] [tense music] - The waterfront. [door unlatching] - [Terry] Iris, hey! [door slams] [footsteps receding] [tense music] - Did Bobby invite you down to the waterfront? - [Iris] No. - Did you invite Bobby down to the waterfront? - No he called me early this morning uh, and he was talking very nonsensical and worrisome and it made me feel the need to go and find him. Um, and I had said, it's a spot that we used to go to in the beginning of our relationship. I just figured that that's probably where he was. - [Sergeant Hudson] So how did your dad know where to find him? - My dad came with me. He just wanted to make sure that I was okay. - You sure your father didn't take the law into his own hands? - He did not. - How would you describe you and Bobby's relationship? - Well we, we didn't really have a relationship. I didn't know him well. I just got out of prison a week ago so. - Listen, he just got out of prison. I made him promise me he wouldn't do anything. He's not a violent man. - How would you describe Bobby and your father's relationship? - I know what you're trying to do. - [Sergeant Hudson] Do you? - Yes and I know how it looks. I get it. I know how this looks. He didn't do it. He wasn't there when the gun went off. My dad was not there when the gun went off. I was. [door unlatching] No just, wait here okay? - Okay. [tense music] - Bobby! [somber music] What are you doing? [somber music] [boat horn blowing] [Lloyd gasping] Bobby I love you it's, I'm not angry any more. I'm not angry anymore. Come on, just put it down. Bobby put it down. - I don't know why you're givin' two shits about me. - Because I love you. - Stay. [tense music] - Come on, you don't need that. Just, put it down. - Go home. Go home. Leave me alone. You don't wanna remember me like this. - Come home with me. - [Bobby] Come home with you [laughs]? - Yeah. - [Bobby] Yeah, go home with you. - Come on. - Let's go back to just before the shot. [Iris sighs] - Okay. Again, I found Bobby at the waterfront, he already had his gun out. Um, so I was trying to talk him down. I was trying to talk him out of it. I was trying to talk him into coming back home with me um, and he... - I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling like less of a... You make me feel like, like you make me feel... I'm supposed to be your fuckin' husband, and I'm more like a God damn roommate. You think I don't know that? - Come, just put it down. It's fine. [tense music] Bobby please put it down. - Iris? - [Iris] Yeah? [Bobby sniffs] [tense music] Okay, it's okay. - Iris? - The waterfront? They're at the waterfront. This whole God damn river's a waterfront. [Bobby sobs] - It's okay. It's okay. It's fine. It's okay. It's okay. Come home, come home, come home. Come home with me alright? [boat horn blowing] - Oh no. - Iris, I tried. - [Iris] No! [shot firing] - Iris! - What the fuck was that? - No Bobby! [Iris screams] - Iris! Oh Jesus Christ. - [Iris] Oh my God. - Here give me the gun, give me the gun - Oh my God. [gravel crunching] [door slams] - Fuck! [footsteps thudding] - [Iris] Oh my God! Help me, help me, help me! - What do you do? What do you do? [Iris gasping] - Okay, alright, alright. Oh no, no! - [Terry] Drop the gun! - No just, I'm just holding the gun! - On the ground! - I'm putting it down! I'm putting it down! - [Iris] Okay, okay. Oh my God [sobbing]. Get help! Call help! Get help! It's okay. Okay, it's okay. - We have an officer down. 48 on the riverside bridge. - Bobby, Bobby! - [Terry] Bring an ambulance. - I tried to stop him, I tried to stop him. - Yeah what's that? Okay. - [Iris] I tried to stop him, I tried to stop him, I tried to stop him! - [Terry] Hey, it's okay. - [Iris] Bobby [sobbing]. - Hang in there. Get down on the ground. [Iris sobbing] - [Iris] Okay, okay. [tense music] - Why would an officer of the law shoot himself? - Uh, I don't know. I guess the same reason anybody does. I'm, I'm not a psychologist [laughs]. - [Sergeant Hudson] You had the gun in your hand Lloyd? Why? [Lloyd sighs] - Because I took it from Iris. When she reached for the gun it went off and she had it in her hand. I, I took the gun from her just to prevent anything else from happening. - [Sergeant Hudson] Okay. - [Lloyd] I was just holding it. - [Sergeant Hudson] Okay. - [Lloyd] I was just holding the gun. I did not shoot the gun. [somber music] - It happened so quick. It happened so quickly he, Bobby just raised it to his head so I reached for it because I was trying to stop him and it went off. - [Iris] No! [shot firing] - [Sergeant Hudson] Did Bobby ever hit you? - [Iris] Yes. - [Sergeant Hudson] Sure? - [Iris] Yeah. I know he's like a cop buddy of yours and all. That doesn't make him perfect. - [Sergeant Hudson] Did you go to the hospital? - No. - [Sergeant Hudson] Did your father know that Bobby was physically abusive towards you? - [Iris] Yes, but that would not ever make him take action in the way that you're thinking. [somber music] - [Sergeant Hudson] And you're gonna stand by that statement? - Yes. - [Sergeant Hudson] Okay, I'll have someone come and talk to you in a few minutes and um-- - Wait, can you just please tell me how Bobby is? Do you know how he is? [somber music] [chair rattling] [somber music] [doors slamming] [engine revving] [siren wailing] - I have a beautiful daughter Lloyd. And um, if anybody ever harmed my daughter, I don't know what I would do. You have a daughter Lloyd. Are you sure you didn't go down there to protect your daughter? - Oh [sighs], no. I, I didn't wanna hurt him. I wanted to help. I, yeah it... Somebody hits your daughter it's upsetting but I, I had nothing but good intensions to help them however I could. - [Sergeant Hudson] That's why you were there Lloyd? - Yes, that's why I was there. To support my daughter and, and Bobby. - [Sergeant Hudson] To support Bobby? Have you and Bobby ever fought before? Any kind of physical altercation? [tense music] [Lloyd scoffs] [tense music] [seagulls squawking] [tense music] [footsteps approaching] [Iris sighs] - Is he alive? - Yeah. [Iris exhales] He's gonna be okay, I think. He's stable. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - They're gonna let you go. - What about my dad? [Terry sighs] - You know he didn't shoot him right? - Probably not, but what can we do? Lloyd's a felon, he's there with a gun, Bobby bleedin' on the ground with Iris on the ground trying to stop the bleedin'. Until we get Bobby's story, somebody gotta stay and bein' that all this happened within' a week of his release, Lloyd's it. [tense music] [Iris sighs] [tense music] [Lloyd sighs] - He's alive. - He's alive? Wow. - [Iris] They can't keep you like this if he's alive. [Lloyd sighs] - They're goin' off the evidence they have. And on the surface it doesn't look much like a suicide. Your dad the felon, holding a gun. - He better wake up. It's gonna be okay. Alright? [Iris sighs] Don't worry about me. He's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
