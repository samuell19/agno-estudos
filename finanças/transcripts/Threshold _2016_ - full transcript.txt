Hello? Hello? Caleb? Caleb! Oh, my God! Are you all right? Who's tying all these knots? I know. I'm stiff as Frankenstein. Halloween plans? Oh. Hopefully nothing as scary as this week. I was up every night with colic crying. - Do you have a newborn? - Six weeks. - Oh. Congratulations. - Thanks. - You? - Not quite ready yet. There are no more. I'm about two weeks in. We've been married for three years. Yeah, but the pill's toxic. I don't wanna trick my body every month. That's not what I meant. Yes, yes, yes, dude! Get it, get it, get it! That is the best '90s dance, my man, right here. Yes! Sorry, ladies, you got nothing on my man. - Oh, really? Yeah. - Mmm. Love you, baby. Bringing it back to the '90s. So sexy. All right, Shane, your card. - Ready? - All right. Yeah. Do your best Australian accent, go. - Oh no, that's too hard. - No no no! No passing. No passing. - Shane, you go first. - All right, all right. You wanna see how it's done. That's not a knife, this is a knife. No? Cynthia's next. Show 'em how it's done. Fosters, Australian for beeah. Hey, pretty good, right? Very nice. - Awesome. - Awesome. Well done. Think we'll get a lot of kids? The ones into jam bands, yeah. Granola's healthy. They shouldn't get all junk. - What if we fostered a child? - What, like on TV? No, like a kid that needs a temporary home for whatever reason. So... here, with us? It would be short term, we could see how we take to it. We'd have a kid of our own. Oh! Early birds. Groupies. Come on. Aren't they always troubled? I mean, that's what you hear. Not if they're still really young. And no one's treated them terribly. Could you tell if they had? I dunno much about it, but I think younger's better so we can see what the responsibility's like, you know? What about him? He's adorable. Only four years old. Look at that face. Looks like he has a health issue. Sleep apnea. Wait. Maybe it's not such a big deal. We can look into it. I don't wanna stress you out with this. He's four, some of the hard part's over. And it's temporary, right? We're good. Kid shouldn't have junk. Here we are. Welcome home, Caleb. It's over the fence, ladies and gentlemen! Can't catch him. Caleb with another walk-off home run victory! Whoo! You're the home run king! Yeah-ah-ah! Can you teach me how to do that? Pick it up! Let's go, Caleb! Whoo-hoo! Ahh! Two seconds off your time, Andretti. Let's go again. Come on. - OK? - Yep, yep. Oh God, you're gonna make him neurotic. - Life is measurements, baby. - Hope not. Oh... burn! Let's go, Caleb! I like being on the train. I like that one. Like this? Yeah, that's perfect. Whoo! Oh, that one there, honey. She hasn't had any. Oh. That piece is a little too big. Not too much, otherwise it gets stuck in their throat and they can't breathe, right? Just little pieces like this. Yeah, that's great, Caleb. Uh! Aww! Hey, look who's here. Ooh. Daddy! Heya, bud! Ahh! You finished work early, Daddy. Yeah, I didn't wanna miss anything. Having fun? - Mm-hmm. - Here. - Feeding some ducks, huh? - Take a piece. Let's see what you got. Lemme see that arm. That's great. Now you can go anywhere in your dreams. Even under the lake with all the little fishies. Like a snorkel. Ganesha's an elephant. - Who's that, honey? - Ganesha. I'm an elephant. The hose is my nose. Yeah, it does look a little bit like an elephant's nose. Who taught you that word, what is it? Ganesha? OK. Good night, Caleb. - Don't go. - Well, what is it? Are you my mommy now? Yeah. Yeah. Do you want me to be? Are you gonna come back? Of course I am. You made it. All the way from down the street. - Any chance I can get a massage? - I am not working tonight. - Come in. - You look great. Heyyy. Rick, you're so fashionable. Yeah, I know I'm late. But how many bars you got? Nah, we don't have any bars, but the fridge is maxed out-- No, no, no, these bars, boss. You got the tower up and buzzing? Just came down. Guess yours is off. Hey, man, it's Friday night. Cynthia probably hid it from me, keep me outta the office. Well, she takes her work home. Lucky man. Got no excuse being so uptight. I'll show you the extra fridge. Come on, one. Nah. I want Cynth to get her yaya's out, so I'm on daddy damage control. Are you really making it official? Yeah, we sent in all the adoption paperwork. Had the home study. We got approved. Your hands are amazing. - I kinda feel sorry for you. - Oh, thanks a lot. Cuz you can't use 'em on yourself. Oh, yes I can. Oh you're nasty, I love it. Oh, I love this song! Let's dance. You're doin' a great thing here, man. He's a great kid. And, uh, Cynthia's really bonding too. Here we go. Hey hey hey, c'mon? - Hey, it's a party. - It's too loud. Ohhh, you gonna be a librarian? At least be a naughty librarian. - Let's see that Running Man. - C'mon, dance with me. Caleb? Can't sleep, buddy? They're not sleeping. That's because they're nocturnal. Like an owl. They rest in the daylight and they're busy at night. - Like fireflies? - Yeah, that's right, bud. How do they get the light inside? OK, let's go back to bed, buddy. Daddy, I wanna see. Well, the light is really a chemical. It's like a juice that sends out tiny little particles that our eyes see as light. OK, let's get this back on you so you can pick out a story to read. Ready? There's Cassiopeia. - Which one? - That W. Constellations are really anything you wanna make 'em out to be. The only one that looks like anything to me is the Big Dipper. No. I can see them. I can't imagine doing what you're doing. Putting your life aside for somebody else. Somebody else's kid. He's the center of your universe now. Yeah. He really is starting to feel more and more like our own. But... you see that one? That is a champagne supernova. - Gonna go get us some. - OK. Shit! Mommy? Mommy? What are those lights? It's just the universe. Wait. What? Hold my hand. - Mommy? - Aaron?! Aaron?! And these are your only anticipated guests? Mainly just our friends. Extended family? It was a closed adoption. We don't have any information about his birth family. Or anything specific about who fostered him before us. I understand. So would you like us to draft his obituary then? But if the universe and all matter emanates from this same underlying field, then don't we have science for a soul? And where the soul ultimately returns? It's all the same energy. And our consciousness or soul interacts with the field outside linear time. That gets back to the whole holographic universe idea. Everything is just a mental projection. OK. So what I'm hearing this book does best is build bridges to other works about the soul, about the afterlife, about our place in the universe. But let's take this book for its own merits. Hi. Can we help you? Have you read The All Field? I'm sorry. It does look a little bit like an elephant's nose. You done? Can I take your plate? Your wedding invitations, do you remember the font, the shade and texture of the paper? Yeah. How did you mail them? At the post office. I mean, did you prepare them yourselves, write the addresses? I wrote them. Aaron stuffed them in the envelopes. You did them together. And when you sent them off, out of your hands, into the vast world of chance, mishaps and others' accidents-- I think that the mail is pretty reliable. - It's a metaphor, Aaron. - I got that. I just don't think that the postal service is careless. Certain individuals, yeah, maybe. And thinking back on this shared experience, what's the first word that occurs to you? Commitment. Oh, yeah, you said that so fast. Um, that's what I think of too. She's always been a little slow with that one. Aaron, do you blame Cynthia for your loss? How long are they gonna keep doing this? "All beings pass into nature, which is my own." "And under my will, all is annihilated at the end." Now, similar to Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, if we look later to the Ganesha Purana... Ganesha? The Hindu deity? He was always portrayed with an elephant's head. Here, why don't you read from the marked passage here? "I am anadi, beginningless. I am Aja, the unborn, taking birth in many wombs only to protect the selfless and abolish the wicked. I am bhutatma, the One soul in all beings. I am the cause of the world and its imperishable witness. Yet I annihilate all at the world's end." Yeah. Do you have a ride out there? I do, I do, I do. Bye-bye. - Dagan? - Yeah. I read ahead. I was wondering, is there anything else that I could get started on? Of course. Om mani padme om. Om mani padme om. Om mani padme om. Om mani padme om. Om mani padme om. Non-attachment. A constant equal-mindedness to all desirable and undesirable happenings. Om mani padme om. Hey, hey? What are you doing? Just cleaning. You think you're enlightened past his memory now? You don't get to decide that for me. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? I just pulled over to make a call. You OK? It's been weeks since I've seen you. Hey, slow down! Goddamn! I'll see you later, Liz. Hey? Hey?! What are these things? It's Ganesha. What? Are you putting them out there? Then why do they keep showing up? The garage door was open. Sorry. Don't use that. You really shouldn't eat that. I made us some quinoa and kale salad. Us? No, you didn't 'cause you know I don't like that stuff. Well, that's proven radiation. Like your cellphone? That hasn't been proven either? That's just 'cause you follow the company line and read studies that further what you want to believe. Oh, I do that? Man is made by his beliefs. As he believes, so he is. Gita, verse 17.3. Oh, you have very energetic hands. Wow. How does it see the energy? The All Field. It's Kirlian photography. A Russian husband and wife, they discovered it together in the '30s. You know what, find something else that has power for you. OK. I was gonna throw this away. Hmm. Oh yeah, look at that. The energy never leaves, it just transforms. So this sends energy to see energy. It's simple. We do the same. We hold our intentions within the field and... and we focus until it manifests. What would you like it to show you? That he's all right, somewhere. That he doesn't blame me. Uh. Aaron... this is Dagan. He leads our book club. Hi. - Small club. - It's a pleasure. I was, um, I was just showing your wife some electrography. Doesn't look like a book club. Would you like to try it? It's cool, check it out. Dagan? - Get his shit out of my house. - You asshole! I am so incredibly sorry. It's all right. Just a bruise. It shocks you into awareness. Keep focus on yours and see what answers it brings. Yeah, it looks pretty fried. I've got no service, but why am I still picking up so much RF? This place is buzzing like Chernobyl. Is there another tower nearby? Not ours. And the whole cell's out? If you finished checking the branches, come on down. Copy that, boss. I don't know, maybe little league struck it out. Too many parents postin' on Instagram. You wanna grab a beer? What, now? Who's gonna tell? Music, whale song, chant, or silence? Did you see the news today? About all the whales? No. I think our Internet's been down. We've lost about 130 whales from the stranding yesterday. So it's, it's a high mortality rate. We roughly have 70 whales left to rescue, but that's-- I've heard there are 200 whales stranded, and I'm here to help them. Yeah, they're just too big for us to even contemplate trying to shift them. It's a pretty specialist task disposing of, or putting these sort of whales out of their misery. And nobody else could get here any sooner. - Have you seen this? - Area residents are familiar with the occasional beach stranding, but never one like this. - More than 600... - Nope. ...sea turtles have washed ashore. Experts are desperately trying to figure out why... Animals are dying worldwide. Aren't they always? With more from Purs-- Unsuspecting birds flew straight into skyscrapers. Most migratory songbirds fly toward their destination at night, which increases their risk of crashing into tall buildings. Birds mistake reflections for sky and flew straight into the glass at full speed. Some researchers believe that collision with buildings is preventable with the flick of a switch. Communication towers... Cable's out too? I'll call the cable company. All these whales are beaching. Mercury's in retrograde. Mercury? The planet? Is that astrology stuff? It interrupts all kinds of electronic devices. Communications. Well, maybe the whales shoulda checked their horoscope. Land line's dead too. You're driving me nuts. That's how you practice. Can't you just play a full song? That's not how you practice. I'm sorry if a bit of self- discipline gives you a headache. This self-discipline? Stop. Aaron. There's a retreat this weekend. You should really come. I shouldcome. Aaron, you reek. At least you still have one of your senses left. The lights are out. - Good. - No, Aaron, the power's out. Transformer must've blown. It's not just here. It's happening everywhere. It's a power failure. I didn't see any whales washed up outside. Oh, my God! Aaron! Aaron! - What is it? - There's someone there! - What? - In Caleb's room! What do you mean there's someone in his room? There's someone there! I saw them! Please don't go up there. Aaron! Please, let's just go outside. OK? Call 911. See if the phone is back on. No. Aaron! Please don't go up there! Go! Go! Go! Is somebody in there? Hello? Who are you? What are you doing in here? - Aaron?! - Hey! Answer me. How did you get in here? Don't, don't move, stay there. Cynthia! - I've found you. - Aaron! It's time. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. - Grab a sheet. - Why? She's not gonna be out long. Go, go, go. Was the phone back on? No. OK, let's put her in the garage. Is that safe? There's tools and saws out there. It's the only door that doesn't lock from the inside. She won't be able to get out. Set her down. - You should lock your car. - What, in the garage? Are you seriously giving me a lecture about locking doors right now, Aaron? - How do you think she got in? - I don't know. You always lock the door when you're in your car bartending? Careful where you point that one. What did she say to you? Just that she'd, she'd found me. - Do you know who she is? - Of course not. - Found you? - And that it was time. - Time for what? - I don't know. That's just what she said. She's waking up. Get inside. Can you hear me? Say "yes" if you can hear me. Yes. What the hell are you doing in our house? - Let me talk to her. - No. She has some kinda thing for you. - Just let me talk to her. - No. Go upstairs and get us some clothes. C'mon. - Hello? Can you hear me? - Hey! Damnit! What's your name? Please just tell us your name. We are all one, Cynthia. How the fuck did you know her name? Huh? Who are you? - Who is she? - I don't know! How do you know my name? He left you through that door. I've every right to defend myself in my home. Understand me? Crazy bitch. How did she know that? Maybe the phones are working. She said that he left us through the garage door, Aaron. - Why was she in Caleb's room? - 'Cause she's fucking crazy! You can get that off the Internet. Yeah, but his room? It was a publicized accident in front of our house. The names, addresses, all the circumstances. She's not here to hurt us. She came naked with no weapon. No, Aaron, something is happening tonight. - Stop! Stop it. - The whales, the power, all of the communications. Get your head out of the astrology and book club and all that bullshit and screw your head on straight. Are you OK? - I cut myself. - She's hurt. Tough shit. You tied her. She can't hurt anyone but herself. Just let me go. Wait! Show us you're still tied. Show us your hands. - What did you step on? - I don't know. God, Aaron, it looks deep. I think that we should just take her back into the house. Are you insane? She's not coming back in our house. It is no longer your house. That's why we must prepare. Back inside. We put her in your hatchback and take her to the police. That's safe? Being in a moving car with her? What if she freaks out and we lose control? You drive, I'll watch her in the back. I'm not doing it. It's not safe. - Don't, don't do this. - What, be rational? You wanna cozy up to that criminal and see what mystical message she's broken in to tell you? I know you're on that wavelength. The two-way radios will still work. If you're not gonna help me, Rick will. Fine. You go do that, I'll bandage her. No. No, you can ask her anything you want in the car. I'm not taking the car. If you take advantage of this goodwill, you will be harmed. Understand? I've not come here to harm you. Two minutes. Leave the door open. Rick? Rick, this is Aaron, do you copy? If you can hear me, there is an emergency at my house. Over. This might hurt a little. Is that OK? You have gentle, healing hands. They're your livelihood. Have we ever met before? We have all met before. Energy flows so easily through them. You're a conduit. Open. Giving of yourself. No one's ever put it quite like that. Well, these are extraordinary circumstances, aren't they? I'm gonna go get you some bandages and some clothes. - You arekind. - What? He deserved kindness. Like when you took Caleb to the pond to feed the geese. How do you know what I did with my son? Were you watching us? Only from the Oneness. Your son has lived many lives. Rick? Can you hear me? I'm leaving the emergency signal on. Where is she? She's in the bathroom. Were you crying? No. Did you speak to Rick? No. Were you? No. I'm gonna go get her some clothes, OK? - She has the sheet. - Got wet. She's not a ghost, Aaron, she doesn't need to wear a sheet. The teachers are all spirit guides. Then are these characters real? It doesn't matter. Even if the characters aren't, the authors are the true spirit guides. Why don't you get my keys and then I'll put this stuff on her? - You're going with me now? - Yeah, let's take her. - Wait, where are your keys? - You'll have to find them. I need to cut your ties to get the clothes on. But if I do this, I'm going to ask for something in return from you. OK? Cynth? Where the hell are they? I don't know, Aaron. Why are you here, in our house? The release from binds. I've come to offer you the same. I asked a straight question, I want a straight answer. If I tell you, completely, we risk the very reason I've come. And that door cannot be allowed to close. Fine. - I can't find them anywhere. - Well, check outside. I may have left them out on the patio when I was starting a new mandala. Jesus. C'mon. Is she dressed yet? I'll watch the door, you go look for the keys. - No, I don't wanna go out there. - This is absurd. Absolutely absurd. Rick? This is Aaron. Do you copy? Rick, this is Aaron. Do you copy? Upstairs. Please sit. This is where you feel him most clearly, isn't it? In his room. Yes. Take my hands. Become your breathing. Deeply in. Gently out. Slow and steady. Just like you helped him to breathe, right here in this room. His elephant nose? Ganesha? Those little figurines, did you put them there? Release from mind. Its questions. Its tyranny. Become your breathing only. Opening. Opening. Opening. We invite Caleb from the Oneness. I can feel him here now, can't you? He's here. Yeah, I can feel him. Let him move through you like breath. Let him speak with yours. What is it that you want to say to Caleb? I... Caleb? I miss you. I love you. Let your breath carry the words from deeper within. Purge them out. Are you happy? Free? In the All? - I can feel his energy. - Comfort him, not yourself. Breathe. Surrender your words. I took down all of his pictures. I didn't deserve him. I'm so selfish, stupid. Aaron was right. I left the door open. I left the door open. Cynthia? Cynthia? No! No! Arrrgh! - Don't hurt her! - You untied her? - Don't breathe in his blame. - Shut up! - Get the ties! - She doesn't need them, Aaron. She's not here to hurt us. I'm gonna hurt her. Do you want that? He's infecting you. You'll need to be pure. Now! You say another word to my wife, I'm gonna snap your fucking neck! - Aaron, there are no more. - Bullshit. You were watching him. Here. Responsible. And you've blamed her. Coward. You've betrayed her. Better use of a power cord in a power failure. - No thanks to you. - There are no more. - I think the cops are here. - What? Why? I saw lights outside. Thank God. She can prophesize to them. Here, let's get her up. It's coming from out back. Maybe someone heard me break down the door after you locked me out. - I didn't lock you out. - Yeah? Then who did? Where are they? There are no roads back there. Maybe they're at the front? Oh, my God! What is that? - What is it? - I don't know. - Looks like the Northern Lights. - The Northern Lights, Aaron? I don't know what it is, Cynthia! OK, OK. We're taking my car. C'mon. Where is everybody? Why isn't anyone else seeing this? Many have already gone. What do you mean already gone? - This is the end. - You are crazy. Must be liberating, huh? You just imagine something, and so be it. - Aaron? - It's just a weather thing. OK? It's connected to everything else going on, the power outage. It's an electrical storm thing. All right? Watch her, I'll be right back. - Wait, where are you going? - To grab something. Watch her. Don't breathe in his fear. Breathe with me. What the fu-- Your path to tonight began under that tree, didn't it? Miss? Is this your property? Is this your home? He held you then. He supported you. Strong and rooted like this tree. He did. But then he collapsed, into his own weakness, and he let go of you. And what is his weakness? He's so rational. Really he's afraid of anything he can't see or prove or measure. Faith, for him, is fear. Cowardice is his weakness. That's why he blamed you. Betrayed you. It was my fault. What happened there was not your fault. And it is forgiven. Aaron's judgement is not. You will have to release that torment and Aaron's, if you are going to be with him again. We've grown so far apart. Not Aaron. You have to prepare to leave him behind. To be with Caleb again. Caleb? But I'm not... I'm not his real mother. Pure souls join in the Oneness, where Caleb waits. There are no distinctions in that perfection. What are you? I'm only a guide. We need to go inside. Right now. Wait. Tell him what you said to me. - He's not prepared. - I'm not prepared? - We need to go. - Please, no, just wait. Aaron! She knows about... Remember the night Caleb was killed, how you held me under that tree? - Tell him! - We need to go back inside. Wait! Just please tell him! Why do you have that? If you don't help me pick her up right now, I'm gonna leave her outside. - Is there radiation? - Grab her legs. - Is there radiation? - Yes. There's some. Lift. What's happening? All right, put her here. - Wait, where are you going? - I'm gonna secure the house. Listen to me. Do not let her craziness in. Everything is gonna be fine. We're gonna wait this out and see what's going on, just do not listen to her. This woman got undressed and broke into our house. - It was open to me. - Shut the fuck up! Cynthia, I need you with me. OK? - I am. - OK. Here. What's happening? Is the world ending? It is a beginning. But only for those who are pure. Rick? Are you there, man? I don't know what's going on. There's something weird with the sky. I'm getting crazy radiation readings. Talking to myself. Fuck. Why won't you tell him the things that you know that would convince him? They have no home in him. He's closed. It is not mine to convince. Then why are you here? What do you want with us? Caleb's invited me into your home... to free you into ours. Please, please, just help me to convince Aaron. He is not coming with you. He's my husband. I love him. There is a greater love than you can yet imagine. An all encompassing, indivisible love. Breathe with me now. In. Kathar... Out. ...ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... What did I say? What did I say?! I will staple your mouth shut, so help me God! No. Stop! Stop it, Aaron! How's that feel, huh? You need to get sane. Fast. You know something is happening. No, I don't. Something profound is happening. Do not feed into this. Please, just, just give me your hands. Let me see you. I just need to look at you. Let me memorize you. Memorize me? Look at me. We don't have much time, Aaron. The world is ending. - Just listen to yourself. - We're gonna die. You are so drunk on apocalypse, you cannot see anything else! Only you could make the end of the world so self-centered. - You're hateful. - I don't care if you think I'm the fucking Antichrist, I'm the only thing keeping you from being as insane as she is. She's not insane! She knows things about us and about Caleb. What if she really can help us? What if she's here for a reason greater than we can possibly understand? You know what? If that's what it takes, to get you to walk up these stairs, when the sun comes up and everything is the same... and all the same shit is still all the same shit... fine. Fine. Thank you. I'm doing this for my wife, not for you. All right, now what? Aaron? Aaron, you hear me? Over. Please, sit down. C'mon, sit down. You took my hands. That was real smart. Now take his. Breathe together now. In. Kathar... Out. ...ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathra... somos. I can't pronounce it. I'm not gonna do this. Aaron? No, please? Just try? In. Kathar... Out. ...ismos. Kathar... ismos. Feel his hands. Know them. Kathar... ismos. They held you. Kathar... I miss him. ...below that tree. When you felt the world would give way beneath you, his hands cradled you up. You did. In that unity you created... you shielded her eyes from his soul passing, with protective hands. Didn't you? I tried. I wouldn't give you a child. And then I took him away from you. - No, you didn't. - Yeah, I did. You did not. Feel his hands. Know them. Does she? Life embeds in the hands like the rings of a tree. Feel hers. Every loving, trusting canyon of her hands. Tell your wife what you've done. To Caleb, what you've done. I don't know what you want me to say. Feel his hands. Feel how he let you go. Tell her. I didn't let Caleb look at the fireflies. I pulled him away from the window because I was tired. He wandered away because I fell asleep. Sorry. So sorry, I never meant to blame you. Tell her what you've done. He hasn't done anything wrong. From his hands, you can sense it. Feel them again. - Tell her how you let her go. - What does she mean? - You're really asking me that? - Only the truth will survive. Purge. Confess. Kathar... ismos. Is there something else about that night? No. That night you saved a life. A life in the road. Go to hell. I'm done with this. Why would you say that? The only thing you know is we lost a child. You have no decency. A different life. An animal's life. Who are you? Huh? - Who the hell are you? - Wait. Aaron. Stop! I told you she knows things. OK? I told you, she knows. - Whatever it is, just tell me. - Tell her. You can tell me. You want honesty? That's what I want. You weren't home. You were at some retreat. - Who knows, I quit asking. - I always asked you to come. You always told me I shouldcome. There's a difference. What happened when I was away? You were away. Do you understand that? What happened, Aaron? A few months ago, it was a Friday after work, and a few of us, we got drinks. And one of the new field managers drank too much so I offered her a ride home. She lives by us. Across from here, we saw a dog. So I picked it up and put it in the backyard. We went inside to call the number on the tag but no one picked up. She sobered up and started asking me questions about you and our family. The pictures. And for the first time, I just, I let it all go. Like a little kid. And I just felt weak and pathetic. And then, I don't know what happened but I reached out and I turned her to kiss me. And she did. And I don't know if it was because of pity or what but she didn't stop me. And so we had sex in our living room. And then we slept. We slept in our bed. Strangers. And when I woke up, I felt better. I finally just, I felt better. He's betrayed you. No. I abandoned you. I'm sorry. I still love you. I really love you. I love you. I love you. Power's back on. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna see what's going on. Come with me. Let him go. Like he let you go. I'm gonna check outside. Stay here. We're gonna be OK. Aaron? Aaron, I'm here at the house. You there, buddy? Over. We need to be upstairs, where you'll feel him most powerfully. He will come to you and lead you across. Aaron? Aaron?! He's already left you. You've cleared him. - You need to be brave. - What if it's all OK now? Aaron! Cynthia? You all right? What, is Aaron here? - Where is she? - What's going on? - My radio-- - You didn't see Aaron out there? So he's here. - Where is she? - Where's who? We don't know. Aaron? Aaron, are you here? Aaron, you hear me? - Hello? Hello? - Hello? Hello? Arrgh! Shhh! It's time now. Upstairs. Upstairs. Sit. Why are you doing this? We haven't done anything to you. Rick? Jesus, Rick?! Rick? Do you hear me? Aaron! Cynthia? Cynthia! Ah, shit. Cynthia! Aaron! She's blocked the door! Leave us! You are jeopardizing everything. Cynthia? Breathe. Let go of all the illusions that bind you here. Aaron, she has a knife! Put that down. You hear me? Put it down. The radiation is gone. Everything is OK. Open the door and let me in, please. Put down the knife. Open the door, put down the knife. Please. - Aaron?! - He won't intrude again. Take my hands. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. Kathar... ismos. I can feel him here now. Don't you? Yeah. Yeah, Caleb's here in the room with us. He's come to take you into the Oneness. Away from this place of impurity and pain. You are ready. No! No! Aaron! No! No! Stop it! What did you do? I protected your passage. Your eternity. And he's here now to lead us across. I'll show you. No! No, no, no! God! No! Now, Cynthia. It's time. Please, please. I'll get you help. I promise. Promise? You're barren. Empty. You never deserved him. Aaron? Aaron?! God, you're hurt. You're hurt. Hi! I need an ambulance at 3829 Clinton Street. Three people are very badly hurt. Yes, it's an emergency. We had to reset his shoulder and operate on some bleeding caused by the broken ribs, and then we stitched him up. But he's doing, he's doing well. Thank you. Thank you so much, Dr. Clair. And, um, Rick Dunham? I filled out his paperwork? I believe he's in surgery. But I'll check for you. Dr. Clair? There was a woman. Um, she was admitted about the same time as Aaron? Her name? We don't know her name. I'll inquire. ...is a massive burst of energy from the sun called a solar storm. There's a couple different ways these things can happen. One of them involves basically a magnetic field and what ultimately happens is a whole burst of light can shoot out causing some problems. The even bigger ones that are solar storms, they can do even more. In addition to a burst of light, they can send out this massive junk, basically sun plasma, which can affect a lot of things. What can it affect? Well, first of all, think about what our world is doing today. We use satellites for almost everything. Communications systems, emergency communication systems, TV, Internet, but it doesn't end there. It can actually knock out some electric grids. Let's go to this video. I want you to see this. I wanna tell you the exact words NASA put along with this. This was an observation of one of the most massive eruptions in years. They said Earth was in the line of fire this time. So what are the stakes here? Let's come back to my screen to see some information. You're awake. You're here. Of course. How you feelin'? I don't know. I guess that's a good thing. Something smells good, though. Oh, I, um, made a burrito. Like a microwave burrito? Yep. A microwave burrito. Oooh. Yeah, yeah. I think I know how I feel. Apparently, it was a solar storm. Last night. No kidding? Yeah. I guess that's what made the lights. Threw the animals off. I can tell you didn't hurt your head too bad. Oh, look who's rejoined the world. Hola, señor. And speaking foreign languages? Can be a side-effect of the brain surgery. Welcome back. Hey, Cynthia, could I see you outside just for a moment? Rick Dunham is out of surgery and he's stable. Oh, thank God. That woman you asked after, you don't know her name? Or any identifying information? No. But maybe she can tell us when she wakes up. Mrs. Dorset, I'm sorry, but she won't wake up. I'm very sorry. You do know that she did it to herself, right? Oh, yes. She's been here before. I wanna sign it. And say what? I don't know. Something sweet. OK. Nothing embarrassing. How come sweet's embarrassing? How 'bout "Cynthia was here"? That works. I am here. She knew that we brought him here to feed the ducks. And that day of the party was the only time we ever did that. How'd she know? Maybe she was following us or something. What difference does it make now? I don't know. It's just... well, she had so much invested in who we are, our lives. Who was she? This is Aaron. Hello, Mr. Dorset. This is Detective Larson. Detective. We concluded the preliminaries and can release a name. Carole Audren was your intruder. We can set a time to have you and your wife discuss pressing charges. This is it. She lived here? Yep. Read magazines and paid bills like the rest of us. Lemme see. Carole Audren. There's someone there! What? I think I saw someone. Something moved. - Jesus. Let's go. - OK, wait. It's a dog. It's a dog! We gotta get it out. Are you OK? Aaron? That's the dog. What do you mean? That's the same dog. What? You mean... That's the one I found. Yes, 1701 Fairhill... It's still alive. Yeah, it's inside. I gotta go back, I still have her mail. No one's coming to get that. Let's go home. You hungry? Yeah. Aaron? Aaron! What's wrong? She knew all about his sleep apnea. His elephant nose. It was on his foster profile. But he said the word "Ganesha" to me. He lived with whoever left those figurines, Aaron. We don't know that. It could be a coincidence. You still believe in coincidences? What if Caleb was her boy? Thank God they took him away from her. Wanna roll onto your back?
