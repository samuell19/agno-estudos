The blonde girl is Maria,.. ..my best friend, at age 7. l'm the other one. lt's hard growing up with someone so revoltingly fortunate. The only one who seemed to understand me was Paolo,.. ..maybe because even for him.. ..life had never exactly been a picnic. l spent vacations collecting shells. Maria, however, preferred collecting of another kind: ..boys. All of them, except Paolo. Maybe he was too bulky even to manage to fit in an album. But me, l was fond of that boy. And l knew he liked me, too. We just had to wait for the right moment. And finally, that moment arrived. Maria and l had come home for summer vacation.. ..after two years studying abroad. Older, but underneath still the same friends as always. Paolo, in contrast, had changed. Wow, had he changed. lf l'd been thinking at all, l would have forgotten about it: ..Maria knows how to get whatever she wants. But that time things were different. The guy Maria was rubbing against wasn't just anyone,.. ..it was my chubby little boy,.. ..my pimply adolescent, my nearsighted guy. lt was Paolo. My Paolo. Love makes us do horrible things. - Everyone's in the conference room. - l know. l'll leave your phone messages on your desk. Maria already called three times. How do l look? - The truth? - Oh, go on! Models in underwear have been seen a million times already. l expected a more original, creative idea,.. .. outrageous, offbeat. Well anyway, we hope it'll get there soon. Sure, but now we'll need to review the proposed budget.. ..and production schedule. Sadly, the deadline stays as is. lt's up to you to find a solution. We really should get going now. And please, a bit more creativity. - Thank you. - Good afternoon. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. A little creativity, please. Okay, let's stay calm. He asked for another idea, we just have to find it. No big deal. Get to work. - Everything okay? - So-so... - Maria called.... - Hold on. Yes? What do you mean ''postpone the auditions''? How many models did you call? That's not enough, we'll need at least twice that. Let me have their composites, l'll look at them later. Okay? Bye, thanks. - What about Maria? - Waiting for you downstairs at one. Seemed really urgent. - At one? - Yeah, 10 minutes ago! - Ah, l'll never hear the end of it! Hi, sorry. l was about to start a new life as a curbstone. l had a meeting. What's so urgent? - l even skipped shiatsu! - Okay, come on! Tell me. - Headline: Party at Gustavo's. - Who? Course of action: buy a yummy gift for him.. ..and a decent dress for you. - Are you joking? There'll be lots of people, great party, you could score. l've got no intention of scoring. And anyway, what's wrong with the way l dress? lf l tell you, promise you won't get mad. Hmm, not bad! l think it's been retouched, guys like that don't exist! They do! But they're usually gay! - Well, what should l give him? - Who? Gustavo! The one from the party where you can score! - Who is it that wants to score? - Sweetheart, finally! - Hi. So? Oh, from court to here by motorcycle in 35 minutes... A rush! Nowadays you only find good coffee in bookstores,.. ..real sushi in boutiques like in London,.. ..and pasta in art galleries. - Are you ready to order? l haven't decided yet. - Should l order for you, too? - Two lukewarm cappuccinos, not too frothy. And for me a barley coffee. ln a large cup. With hot water on the side. What do you think she could give to Gustavo? - l don't even know what he's like! - Kind of a jerk. You need something original, something striking. A roof tile! l know, some nail polish! - For Gustavo? He's a man! - So? What do you mean? We're in the third millennium! Modern guys no longer hide their femininity! Today men wear make-up, wax, go to the beautician. And wear nail polish. Like Beckham! - Even the idea of Gustavo with nail polish is a nightmare. - Babe? What do you think, should we tell her now? Maybe it would be better to wait. Tell me what? Some news. Some big news. - Well, it's not really.... - Shall l? Ready? ln two months.. ..Paolo and l.. ..are getting married. - To each other? - Well, l should hope so. Ah, wait! You have to give me some advice. Do you prefer this on ivory.. ..or black on dark blue? - Maybe black on dark blue, right? Clearly you'll be my maid of honor. lsn't it brilliant news? Brilliant! Hi, Lucia, it's Paolo, and... l wanted to know how you were. You know, Maria is sometimes a little too.... l wanted to tell you myself. Call me back? The quarry is scarce and has grown very, very cunning. So the strategy for this evening is: say nothing intelligent,.. ..observe closely and make few mistakes. Welcome to my party, girls! - Hi. - Hi. Have we met? No, but Paolo has told me a lot about you. Ah, l do feel positive karma, really positive. - Oh, here's Paolo! - Hey there! The genius of the court, as it were. Didn't know you had two girlfriends. lnteresting choice! Actually, that's Maria, my fiancee, and this is.... ....Lucia, just a friend. - This is a present for you. - Merci beaucoup. l hope it's not a book, l've already got one! Have fun, make yourselves at home, mine! Here you go. Well? What did you think of Gustavo? Right, let's forget it. And that guy over there? - But that's depressing! Come on! - l was joking, silly! l've got it, the professor! That guy there! ls it possible that you never like anyone? So? How's it going? - Excuse me, off to the bathroom. Hold this for me, please? - Sure. - l'll leave you my bag. - Okay. Look at what she's done to me! Even a barrette! - Really not bad. - What are you doing here? lt's still my house, isn't it? What would you say to a nice relaxing bath, Maria? Come on, l was joking! By the way, they tell me you work in.. ..the seductive world of show business... No, advertising. And anyway, my name is Lucia. Oh, advertising! l like it because it lasts 30 seconds. You see it, you like it, you don't, and there goes a new one. Everything in life should last 30 seconds, hmm? Try Viagra, they say it helps. How l love you creative types! - Okay, l'm leaving. - Already? l've got a Tai Chi lesson early tomorrow morning. - l'll go with you. - No, no, l'll take Lucia's car. Excuse me. Excuse me! This way someone will have to take her home. - Bye, sweetie! - Bye. - Hi, where do l know you from? - Group therapy? - No. - Then you've mixed me up with someone else. - No, wait we met.... Where do l know you from? Group therapy? - Alcoholics Anonymous? - Shall we dance? - Let's. - Maybe it was in sewing class. - Nice one! - Aren't you drinking a bit too much? - And you? Hey guys! Off with your undies! l love you... l love you... Shit! Good morning. Up already? Morning. lt's really late. Sorry, but l have a lawsuit with the hospital,.. ..and l haven't fed my cat. My bike is double-parked... l made you French toast. Thanks. Listen, l'll call you later. Bye. l was forgetting something. - ls there coffee, too? - Yes. l was being a real jerk, sorry. No problem. You had a panic attack. A panic attack, exactly. And you understood. You manage to understand me, it's always been like that. - And l know what you're thinking now. - You do? lt's the same thing l'm thinking. You'll see, even if it's difficult, we'll find the right words. Sorry, what words? The words to tell Maria, to explain about us. - You're joking, right? - No. Lucia, listen. What happened was inevitable. We knew it would happen, and it was fantastic. Perhaps we just chose the wrong moment. But as far as Maria, she's not going to know,.. ..because we're not telling her anything. Nothing ever happened. lt'll remain our little secret. Paolo, we love each other. You said ''l love you'', last night, you said it. l said that? Well, if l said it... Look, sorry, l really have to go. l mean it, eh? Our secret. Bye. Everything okay? Good, because it's crazy here this morning. You have to select the models,.. ..check the story-boards and Maria is on line 3. Tell her l'm not here. l need some coffee. Ms. Ferrari hasn't gotten in yet, l'm sorry. Good bye. l brought you your car back! What luck, there was a driveway free! Ginevra, would you mind? l'm your production assistant, not your chauffeur. lt's right downstairs. Wow! And who's this babe? - So, how did it end? - What? - The party. How'd it go? - lt's best just to drop it. Paolo told me everything. Everything? That he took you home and he was a bit drunk, too. Drunk? Sure, you go and leave him there! What could ever happen? l mean, Paolo is nice, he's attentive... But sometimes he's a bit predictable, isn't he? Predictable? l'm his North Star, for him, nothing else exists. Well, apart from work. And his motorcycle. And the Champions League. Anyway, he's not a guy to make you fall head over heels, is he? - Or is he? - No, no. - There, see. l don't know, a guy who knows all about you from the first glance,.. ..who adores the same things you adore... A little... fascinating, restless. Then, even better if he's dark haired, with lovely light eyes and full lips! Anyway, l love Paolo, that's clear, right? But l don't get why you want to marry him. l can't be a girlfriend for life, can l? But if you find a guy like that, give me a call. You never know! - Bye! - See you. You know where she parked? ln front of the emergency room. What a twit. Was that the phone? A sound like the phone ringing. - From in here, did you hear it? - No. Well... - You sure? - Anyhow, she won't call. She'll call! lf only to tell me that it's over, but she'll call. Simone, she kicked you out of the house,.. ..changed the locks, confiscated your car,.. ..froze your bank account, formatted the computer and asked for a divorce. Perhaps, a call to tell you it's over really isn't necessary. - No, she just provoking me. You don't know her. - She's my sister. My wife no longer talks to me,.. ..l don't have a penny and have to live here, in my office, with you. By the way, l wanted to tell you something. As soon as l find a place, l'm gone, don't worry. Yeah. You've been saying that for two years, Antonio. l'll get it! Angela, we have to talk, dammit! Darling? Sardella? - Yeah, l'll get him... - Yes, hello? Yeah, sorry, we were rehearsing a scene. Be brief, l need the phone! Yes, go on! You're making me look like a fool! Sorry, you were saying? Oh, a commercial... You know, l'm an actor. l don't usually do commercials. Sorry, how much did you say? l said goodbye to pockets of fat and water retention. Goodbye to cellulite and unsightly 'orange peel'. Celluvia uncovered the best part of me. l said goodbye to unsightly 'orange peel'... Yes, but this one looks like one of those.... Yes, l would picture her with straight hair. l said goodbye and unsightly 'orange peel'... l said goodbye to pockets of fat,.. ..to water retention, and unsightly 'orange peel'. Goodbye to cellulite. - Hey, what's that guy doing here? - l don't know. - Sorry, what are you doing here? - What do you mean, what am l doing? - You called me for an audition. - Absolutely not! You called me for an audition and, dammit, l'm doing it! No, no. Get out, go away. - Should l go? - As you like, honey, please stay. - Okay, let's go on then! - That's so rude! So rude! Excuse me... Antonio... - Have we met? - Not yet, do you have five minutes? Maria, you said? And who's she, a basket case, a misfit? No. She's just someone who needs to take her mind off things a bit. - And you want me to sleep with her. - Of course not! You should court her, go out with her a few times, show her around... Be nice, in other words. And why me? Because you're impudent, fairly good-looking,.. ..and you don't have even a hint of cellulite. Listen, babe, l'm an actor, not a gigolo, all right? That's what l'm asking you to do, to act. And for a good wage. - How good? - 2000. - Euros? And another 2000 if you get the results l expect you to. l'll have to think it over. l'm really busy right now... Don't think too long, l could find another guy in an instant. - Call me. Bye. - Bye. 2000. Plus another 2000. The new samples arrived. Anyone call? The casting director, producer, costume designer and director. They all want the storyboard, that doesn't exist. And Gianni wants you in his office. - ls that enough? - l'd say so, yes. ''Chandelier''. lt's such a sweet name, isn't it? They say it's a really trendy spot,.. ..better go before it becomes the usual crowded place. - What about Alberto? - l don't know any Alberto. - Alby. - Come on, Alby, he's cute, right? - But he's gay! - Meaning? He's a possibilist. - What does that mean? - He doesn't rule out the chance.. ..to widen his horizons. l'm not desperate enough to try a gay, not even a possibilist. How great if it worked out, you'd be the first woman in his life! How madly romantic. There, wait, pull over here. Here it is, this must be it... - Closed. - ''Chandelier'', closed on Tuesdays. Today is Tuesday. All right, so... sushi? - Sushi! - Pizza! l love reading the list of pizzas, even if l always order a plain one. Even if you can only find real Neapolitan pizza in Savona nowadays. And real baba only in Courmayeur. Funny! Listen to this. Yesterday afternoon l'm at the house of this woman,.. ..all plastic surgery, with backcombed, blonde hair... You couldn't look at her. We're selecting the fabric for her curtains.. ..and at a certain point she settles on the peony. Which already.... Well! l'm there choosing the colors,.. ..and this woman suddenly bursts into tears, desolate. At which point l think: ..''Damn, have l missed the blue nuance of the peony?''. So? The blue was fine, as l'm never wrong about colors. ln short, this poor woman sits down next to me.. ..and tells me a dreadful story. She caught her husband in bed with another woman. These are really absurd situations. Since you eat pizza with your hands, l'm going to wash mine. - Did you say anything to her? - Me? No! Does she know something? l hope not. Paolo... lf Maria did not exist,.. ..if she ran away, disappeared, never returned from the bathroom... Why shouldn't she come back from the bathroom? lf she weren't here, would you be with me? - Answer me! - Perhaps... Yes. Here l am. So, Thursday Momix. Yes, we've seen it 200 times, but the other shows are really hopeless. So, Momix? l have numerous hearings all week... l have to work... Without a doubt, making plans with you is such fun! You know what? l'll go alone! (Okay, let's try again.) (Friendship is more important than love.) (lf you can realize that before it's too late, maybe not all is lost.) (Because you're not a swine, deep down.) (You're not.) (You're not, right?) Hello? Hi, Antonio! Yes, yes, sure it's still valid! Okay, see you tomorrow, in the usual place, at 11 :00. Until tomorrow, then. See you. (Forget l ever mentioned it.) Here. That's her? Wow, she's gorgeous! A shame you can't see her ass. - Let's skip the pleasantries and get to the point. - Okay. To summarize: l meet her by chance, l do my bit, l screw her,.. ..and it's done. - Broadly speaking. l'd say l'll need at least a couple of days, maybe three. Usually they don't put up too much resistance. l believe it, but here the rules are slightly different. Why? ls this Maria the kind of woman who doesn't put out? She's the kind who wouldn't appreciate the term ''put out''. ls that concept comprehensible to you? - l got it, a saint. - No, no. A person with clear ideas. - And so? We'll do a quick training course so you grasp as much as possible.. ..Maria's world, her dreams, tastes, places she goes, everything. And when you're ready you'll get into character. So, are you in? - Do l have a choice? - Yes. l'm in. - When do we start? - lmmediately. You have to think of Maria like a detective thinks of a killer. He's never seen him,.. ..but knows he has to learn to see the world through his eyes. She despises fairy tales, but still dreams of Prince Charming. Well, she found him. Listen to her, not with the air of someone who's listening.. ..while thinking of his business and just nodding his head. - What did l say? - Nodding his head. Mysterious and yet transparent, somber yet cheerful,.. ..ironic and vivacious. Original thinking, unconventional choices, firm decisions. So how'd it go, did you like it? - Antonio? Antonio, what are you doing, sleeping? - No. Between a starter and a pizza Maria is more the pizza type,.. ..but she also likes to try new things, like Japanese. Armani, yes; Gucci, no. Elvis, and not the Beatles. Radiohead, and not Laura Pausini, but... you won't believe it! - She thinks Mango is a genius! - Who? Mango, the singer. ..but Hong Kong, since John Woo went to Hollywood,.. ..is out, is that clear? - Go on, you and your Thai films! lt wasn't that bad. She's literally crazy about airports. Airports? Yeah. Says they're the places where people are at their best. - What a load of crap! - l agree. Don't say ''shit'' every three words like you usually do,.. ..don't tug at your shorts when you stand up,.. ..look into her eyes and not just at her boobs.. ..and please, don't pick your nose! - WlTHDRAWAL NOT POSSlBLE, lNSUFFlClENT FUNDS - lt would just be an advance. l've had some unexpected expenses, l'm remodeling the bathroom. How are you doing with Celluvia? Almost entirely worked out. l have a couple new proposals. - When will you bring them to me? - Tuesday at the latest. We're just missing the film to close the campaign and l want ideas, okay? As for your bathroom, l'll see what l can do. - Don't worry. - Thanks. Lucia! Lucia! Half the world's looking for you! lt's a mess here! Shall l read you the to-do list? Later. l'm on my lunch break. Maria's favorite perfume, she only uses one,.. ..is ''Angel'' from Thierry Mugler. - How do you spell it? - Like it sounds. She likes wine, but isn't a great expert. - Can you manage? - l drink it. What's to know? l thought so. Read this. lf it tastes good, say it has a pleasant bouquet,.. ..and if it's bad, say it's corked. - Corked? - Corked, write it down. Corked... - Do you think she likes Vin Diesel? - Negative. - l saw ''A Man Apart'' 3 times... - Don't even mention it! Tell her that her friends are nice and pretty,.. ..but they are absolutely not your type. ls that true for you, as well? Then... She likes blue roses, long-stemmed. She always drinks barley coffee in a big cup, with hot water on the side,.. ..no sugar because she says it spoils the aroma. - One second! - Shit! Okay, a five minute break, just five! Study! Maria! Gustavo! Look who's here! Wait here,.. ..l'll pop into the stall and be right back. l like this kind of ambiguous situations! l don't, at all. And anyway, l'm Lucia. Ah, yeah, Lucia, l recognize your decolletage. She likes me, definitely. This book is interesting. Really. l have to go. We'll continue tomorrow. Review the lesson. Bye. Training camp, eh? Marines training camp. Model, camouflage suit, really sexy. The model walks in and says: ..''Why camouflage cellulite when you could beat it forever?''. And then a machine gun. Listen, why not during an x-ray? Or an ultrasound? Or a CAT scan! Ginevra, can you bring us some coffee, please? That isn't included in my contract.... And a tuna sandwich, thanks. - Didn't you just have lunch? - Mind your own business. Well? lt'll never work, you know why? Such a man doesn't exist, l won't be convincing. Yes, you will. Maybe not in the long term,.. ..but we just need it to work for a couple of days. Anyway, we're working on the prototype of the perfect man,.. ..if it works, and it will work,.. ..it'll be the masterpiece of the century, our masterpiece. You're saying Maria will be fascinated by a carbon copy. You won't be a carbon copy. You'll be.... You'll be a message of love sent from her ideal world.. ..and delivered by the man of her dreams. Right? - Would you want a man like this? - How do l come into it? Someone who reads the same books.. ..and listens to the same music! Wouldn't you prefer a guy.. ..who got you to do things you'd never done before? Okay, let's concentrate on our target. - What's this? - Maria loves lyric opera. As well! Shit, what rotten luck! Lyric opera as well, why? Hi, Gianni. l was on my way to your office. Celluvia is cracked, we're just missing the last details. Great. What's the idea? On the spot it's difficult to explain, it's a bit complicated. - A rough idea... - Okay. lt's a fantasy setting,.. ..somewhere in the middle between a medical thriller and ''G.l. Jane''. - For Celluvia? - Yeah. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hello? Yes, l'll be right down, sure, thanks. Bye. Sorry, l have a client. Come by, so you can tell me everything, okay? Okay. - Lucia! - Hi, what a surprise! Well, l was passing by and l said to myself: ''Why not....'' lt's been a few days since we talked,.. ..l tried to call you but.... l have a lot of work at the moment. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. Coffee? l have to watch all these tapes. Listen, now it's going to seem stupid,.. ..but l was thinking about the night of the party.... - Our secret. - Exactly. That night. But what surprised me was that harmony between us. Harmony. A shame that l can't quite forget what you said after the harmony. Lucia, l can't stop thinking about you. We have a ton of work to do. We have to watch all these videotapes. lf you'll excuse us... Try this on and in the meantime repeat back the things l told you. - Okay. So... Momix, American, dancers but athletes as well. - Off. Where does the name come from? The name is from Mo as in ''Moses'' and Mix as in.... Mix as in ''Mix''. Moses what? - Uh, Templeton! - Pendleton, and you can't get that wrong. - Off. Reviews? - Okay. ''lngenious use..'' ''..of the body's potential and a surreal taste for..'' ''..imagination and for....'' - For imagination and then what? For imagination and.... Originality breaking the boundaries between dance and sport. Not bad. Right. And for originality breaking the boundaries between.. ..dance and sport. Yes, yes. lt's not going to work. Yes, it will. Speak to her slowly, in a deep voice. Look into her eyes, but without staring. Then look down and smile. But the smile has to catch her by surprise,.. ..you have to smile when she least expects it,.. ..so, wait till she isn't expecting it. Okay. Pendleton... Originality of surreal taste and expressive potential. l look at her. lf she's not expecting it, l smile, because if she is.... Okay. lt's time to go. Put your shoes on. Here. - ''Catwin''? And who's that? - Chatwin. Skim it, to get an idea. And remember she'll be three rows in front of you. Okay. Three rows in front of me. - How are you feeling, nervous? - Nervous? No. Yes. Well, if you're nervous,.. ..just in an emergency take one of these, just one. Excuse me... Excuse me... l think you dropped your book. Thanks, l closed my eyes for a second... - Bye. - Wonderful show, wasn't it? Yes, l've seen it a million times, but it's never boring. The ingenious blend of dance and expressive potential of athletic movement. Sure, l know, the reviewers' usual inanities. - Yes, actually. - Well, goodbye. Could l offer you some coffee? Two coffees. Make mine barley in a big cup, hot water on the side. - What would you like? - l'll have the same. No, really... Lobbies are marvelous observation spots, don't you think? - To observe what? - People. Like waiting rooms,.. ..train stations.. ..and airports. ln my opinion, those are the places where they express themselves best. - Sorry, you'll think l'm crazy. - No, not at all. lt's incredible, but.... Well, l spend whole afternoons in the airport. - Do you travel a lot? - No! God, it's funny, but... l go to observe people. You, too? What a coincidence! Listen, that theory about observing humanity.. ..l found it in Chatwin, and you? - ln who? - ln Chatwin. Your book. Oh, of course, he's my favorite author! - Very.... - Very? - Very. - Very. lndian cinema. According to me that's.. ..a hotbed of new subjects, new ideas. That's exactly the kind of cinema l like. - Come on... - Really. l'm starting to worry. l think we should.... Dark hair, green eyes, a dazzling smile... - He didn't seem real, it's weird! - But wonderful, right? With all the crazies, the maniacs and the losers you come across... lt's a shame things are not all so easy. - No, l know what you mean. Yellow? - Yeah. A wedding, a honeymoon... Then kids, changing diapers... The machinery is on track and there's no stopping it. And then, too bad you just found him now! Maybe he's the man of your dreams! Listen to me. Forget him, it's for the best. - The new samples are here. - Finally! Let's see... Nice crap. - You remember Alby? - Sure? The possibilist. - What? Oh, nothing. Look, we'll talk later, okay? Thanks. You're making me look like a jerk! Anyway... Before l got in the taxi Antonio gave me his number. - Didn't waste any time! - No. But l lost the number. What? l must have written it on a receipt.. ..and before l got home l threw it away. - What? - Seems it was meant to go that way. - No, it wasn't! But you just told me that l should.... Forget what l said! How did you manage to lose it? Lucia, l lost it, lost! Lost! Better that way. Anyway l can't call off my wedding two months beforehand! Do you prefer this green or is the blue better? Sorry, l have an urgent meeting. Bye. See you later. A little dull... Of course it's your fault! Who would write it on a receipt? l assure you, till now nobody ever threw away my number. Fine, come to my place at 7:00. We'll shift to plan B. Okay! Anyhow... lnteresting woman, Maria! Yeah, bye. lnteresting... Well? - l didn't know there was a plan B. - Actually there isn't. But let's not lose heart. l think a second chance encounter is too risky, Maria would catch on. l got it! l pretend to get run over,.. ..so she has to take me to the ER! - That sounds pretty idiotic. - Yeah, kind of. l have an idea! And stop eating those chips! These are her favorite,.. ..l'm in character! - But not a fat character! Why, you prefer me lean and muscular? You're not my type. l'm not your type... - Hey. - Hi... - You remember, we met at.... - Of course, Momix. - Exactly. - Antonio. - Maria. - Right. These aren't the best, they're... corked. - Corked? - Yeah. - Do you shop here? - Yes. No, l mean, not today. l wanted to talk to you. - May l? - Of course. - Let's go? - Okay. Oh, wait. Cork. ....details, because in my opinion the truth lies in them, right? That night, when l got home, l thought over your details. Your skirt, your shoes, the color of your lipstick. lt was a window open to your world, understand? l didn't think that for you everything was so.... - Special? - Yeah. - Yeah. So l started walking around the places.. ..l thought would belong to that world, your world. The streets, the shops... - l was about to give up and then today.... - Today? Nothing, sorry, l'm being nosy. Maybe it'd be better if l go. - Antonio... - Yes? - What do you think of Daniel Oren? l don't know, he's.... Sorry, my phone's vibrating. Excuse me. Who the hell is Daniel Oren? Daniel Oren? Here it is. Daniel Oren, orchestra conductor, lsraeli,.. ..famous for ''Lucy of Lammermoor''. Lammermoor. Right, okay, bye. Bye, bye. - What were we saying? Daniel Oren? - Oren. - The lsraeli orchestra conductor. - Him. Uh, well... he's famous for his ''Lucy of Lammer--'' - Lammermoor. - Lammermoor. - Right. - You know a lot about it, right? - Oh, a bit... So maybe you'd be interested.. ..in coming to see the ''Boheme'' with me tomorrow night. l have two tickets. That's fantastic. - Let's say at 8 o'clock? - At 8 o'clock. Okay. - Well, l have to go. - Okay. - See you later. - Later. Oh, Maria... Yes, hello? Oh, hi, sweetie. Don't kill me, unfortunately tomorrow evening.. ..l have to take that stupid cousin of mine to the opera. That's okay, don't worry about it. Too bad. We'll make it another time. Sweetheart... l love you. l love you, too. Bye, a kiss. Bye. Hello? Hi, Paolo. Tomorrow night? Yes, at your place. Okay. See you tomorrow, then. Bye. - Well? - Huh? - Well? - Well... - l can't understand anything! - Not even reading the libretto? No, it's in German, look, German. You need to read here. Here, see? The ''Boheme'' is a beautiful love story. Tomorrow is the most important play in the game, are you ready? l was born ready. - Give me you hand. - You don't want to put that on me? Sure, Maria likes men who take care of their hands, like Beckham. Please, Lucia, not polish! A little polish never hurt anyone. - Tell me what you're going to do in detail. - Okay. l slip a hand up her dress while the woman on stage drops dead of T.B. lt's not a time to joke. By the way, if you knew how the ''Boheme'' ends,.. ..why did you say you didn't understand anything? Why, why, why... - Stop, it's not dry yet! - Lucia, really... l don't need an instruction manual to get a woman into bed. Maybe not your girlfriends, but with Maria you sure do. Well, given you're the expert, show me how you do it. - There's no time to lose. Give me the other one. - Right, to press on. You want to know what l'll do when the time is right? Supposing that you know how to tell the time is right, which l doubt... Let's hear it! Don't underestimate me, Lucia. l can tell when a woman plays tough so not to show she's fragile. When she's someone who cries often,.. ..but would die rather than be caught crying in public. Someone who dresses like a sergeant, but it's just wasted energy,.. ..because you're so beautiful. Someone who touches her right ear whenever she's in trouble. - Are you scared? - Antonio, cut it out. Well? What? Am l, or am l not, irresistible? Are you done? Not yet. Bye. ....and one day Mimi gets home. She's sick, she's dying. And she asks him: ..''My Rodolfo, do you want me here with you?''. And he replies: ''Yes, for always''. Then she says: ''You're my love, and my whole life''. And dies. Do you know why Divorced Barbie costs twice as much as the others? Barbie? Because she has Ken's house,.. ..Ken's motorcycle, Ken's camper, Ken's SUV,.. .. Ken's bank account, Ken's sheets, Ken's table,.. .. Ken's washer, Ken's towels,.. .. Ken's robe, Ken's skis,.. .. Ken's snow tires! Ken's snow chains! Ken's racquet,.. .. Ken's lawn, Ken's car, Ken's keys... - Were you moved? - No, no, no. No, it's the carpet, l'm slightly allergic. - How about a drink? - Okay. lt's strange, eh? We've known each other forever,.. ..but the times we've been alone l could count on one hand. Well, on one finger of one hand. However, it's a finger worth ten hands. Didn't we decide not to talk about it anymore? - Only with Maria. - Oh, right! - Don't you ever think about it? - Our secret? lt's good. What is it? Oro Pilla Brandy! l swear, l thought nobody drank it anymore. Apart from me, l mean. - Now there are two of us. Cheers. - Cheers. - What do you say to sushi? - Sure. - Okay. You still haven't told me what you do. Obesity was a problem for me until adolescence. Then l don't know what happened. My metabolism kicked in.. ..and in a couple of years l burned off all that excess fat. A world opened up to me,.. ..full off possibilities, l could do anything l wanted. Such as? ....interior design consultant, fabrics, painted ceramics... And l also like to create stuff out of simple objects. l know, none of those is a real job,.. ..but it's really a passion for me. - What l mean is.... - You're an artist, then. Well, not an artist. Let's say it's more a question of touch. You see, clay and stone are pleasing to the touch, right? l like the sensations they transmit to your fingers. #We touch everything for it's with the hands..# #..that a big heart....# Sorry. l had that song.... Don't tell me you like Mango. Yeah. Toss him into prison and throw away the key,.. ..that would have been justice. But who's there? An incompetent public prosecutor. And guess who wins? He does. Acquitted, you believe it? l wanted to strangle him! l'm really happy l found you, Maria. Lucia,.. ..l'm so happy l got you back again. Paolo,.. ..lt's late. l have to go. You don't understand. You should have seen me. l even got Mango in at the right place. A legend! l told you it would work. You have talent. Yeah, l know. l'm a born actor. And know what? As soon as we finish l'll go to the Royal Academy, London. Enough with bargain basement jobs! - What?! - No, not this, on the contrary. Besides, l haven't told you everything yet. Listen. At one point l took her hand,.. ..l looked into her eyes,.. ..then l lowered my gaze, without looking at her boobs. l smiled at her, she wasn't expecting it,.. ..and l kissed her. A real kiss, with some tongue. - Okay, give me a grade, a good one. - B. - A minus. We're almost done. We just have to plan our last meeting,.. ..and we're finished. So? Aren't you pleased? Give me a smile. - Come on, Antonio! - Where are you going? Come here. l'm not Antonio, l'm the perfect man, your creature. - You want to tell me what's up? - Nothing. - Okay, do you want me to tell you what l think? - Let's hear it. You've spent so long convincing yourself that Paolo.. ..was the man of your life, that your brain has melted. The little puppet show you staged won't work for one simple reason: ..you're in love with someone else. You have to tell him. Hi, come up. Paolo? - Hi. - Hi. - Were you expecting someone? - No, no. - Well, l have to talk to you. - Go ahead. Can we go in there? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Come in. Come into the kitchen, l'll make some coffee. Okay, l'll put this down... No! Don't tell me you watch this stuff, too! lndian cinema is not that bad, you know? - Maria's converted you, typical. - Give me your jacket. - Thanks. She always decides! - Holidays, movies, restaurants. - You want that coffee? - Better yet, do you have any beer? - Sure. - Thanks. She always decides. She can make you do what she wants without you even realizing it. Maria? Don't you think you're exaggerating? No, she's really like that. She always gets what she wants. l don't know how she does it. - We all would, don't you think? - That's why l wanted to talk to you. Look, l'm thinking of leaving Maria. What? Now? With less than a month till the wedding! You can't! You mustn't do it, Paolo. - lsn't that what you wanted, too? - No! Yes! ln other words, listen... Okay, l wanted that,.. ..but it's something you can't do lightly, you have to be sure. lt's complicated, you need to know you're in love and, above all, with whom. Well, l think l'm in love with you. ''Think''? Yeah, l mean, l care for you, l like you, l don't want to lose you. Call it what you will. Remember in the pizza place when l asked you: ..''lf Maria weren't here, would you be with me?''. That's the point, Maria exists. She's in your life. You love her, you're about to marry her, you can't just drop it all like that. Excuse me. Antonio? Can you come back in 10 minutes? l'm waxing my legs. l'm sorry, okay. Bye. - lt's nothing. Glass collection. - On Sunday? lncredible, you don't even have time to throw a bottle out and it's gone. Listen, l've thought it over, and you're right. The issue is Maria. She's really in love with me. l'm her reference point, her North Star. For her, nothing else exists. Apart from her workshop. And her Tai Chi course. And Mango. But if l left her, it would break her heart. What is it today? They saw me, they must have seen me. Yes? Maria? Yeah, sure, come up. lt's Maria. She's on her way up. What? l told her l was going to my parents' in the country. Oh, damn! Right, come in here! My helmet! - Hi. - l have to talk to you. Maria, come into the kitchen l'll make you some coffee. You have ''Mission Kashmir'' and you didn't tell me! A great film, isn't it? You want that coffee? - What about a beer? - Sure, l was having one. Thanks. l don't know... l thought all was great with Paolo,.. ..then suddenly there's Antonio and.... What a mess, huh? Look, you're my best friend, you're the only person l trust. Yeah, l know, you think l'm superficial, impulsive, but.... l swear to you, this time l don't know what to do. Tell me what to do. l don't think leaving Paolo is such a good idea. l mean, you made the decision to marry him? Don't be afraid, do what you have to do, that's it. Right. The hardest thing in the world. - ls there someone in there? - No. No, no. lt's glass collection day. - On Sunday? - Will you come with me? Come on. You're not telling me everything! l'd like to know why l can never find my lipstick when l look for it. Antonio? How's he dressed? lt's Antonio! Antonio! - Hi. - Hey, hi! - What are you doing around here? - Me? Just passing, by chance. Once in a while.... This is Lucia, my best friend, this is Antonio. Sorry.. Nice to meet you. Maria is always talking about you. Nice to have a friend who likes you so much, isn't it? - Are you going that way? - Yeah. Then, as l'm going that way, too,.. ..if you don't mind, we can walk together. - That's great! - Okay. - Well we're going. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Antonio? l mulled it over all night. We should call a halt to this thing. At this point it's done, l even have a lunch date with Maria. - Lunch? - Relax, l know what to do. That's why you shouldn't do it. What's with this change of plans? You wouldn't be jealous, would you? Listen, Antonio, we have to talk, there are things l didn't tell you. Look, l'm late, let's do this, l'll see you tonight, okay? For dinner? At 9 o'clock, we'll meet at a new place, that's called.... Wait, what was it called? Maria told me about it. - Oh, ''Chandelier''. - Oh, l know it. - Okay. - Bye. - Oh, so! - l've had it up to here! l ask you for one thing, fucking hell! You were on the phone for an hour! But aren't we having lunch together? What do you have to do, sorry? l have to choose the flowers for the church. - Okay, l'll call my office and come with you. - No. Lucia's coming with me. We could have dinner tonight. Okay, tonight. Sorry, the paint's drying on the table. - lsn't it a door? - Yes, from a stable,.. ..but when l'm done it'll be a great dining table. Without the iron fittings, in perfect harmony with feng shui. So shall we say 9 o'clock? - Okay, at 9. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Enjoy your work. - l'm late. - l'm early. - You look beautiful. - Thanks, you too. - Something to drink? - With pleasure. - Waiter... - Yes? - A Chardonnay Sterling Vineyards from '97. - Fine. - Please, make sure the bottle is really cold. - Yes. - Thanks. Listen. There are some things about me l didn't tell you,.. ..and at this point is seems best to talk about it. Right. l agree, l want to know all about you. Let's say it's something about me that has to do with Maria. Look, for once, could we not talk about Maria? - Okay, no Maria. - Okay. Well? l have a confession to make, by honestly.. ..l don't know where to start, it's not.... Oh, shit, what luck! What rotten luck! - Hi! - Hi! - What a surprise! - What a surprise, Lucia... - You, too, at the ''Chandelier''? - Uh, yeah... What do you say we join you? - Sure, why not? - But sure, come on. - Yeah. - Have a seat. - Okay. - Aren't you going to introduce your escort? - Oh, sorry. Paolo, this is Antonio. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. And this is Maria. - A pleasure. - Nice to meet you. l'll bring the extra place settings right away. ln the meantime, would you like to order? - Yes. - No. - Later. - l need a minute. - l'll come back in five minutes. - Good. Well... You look great, dressed like a woman. Right, Maria? Excuse me, l'm just going to the bathroom. Oh, yes, l have to go to the bathroom, too, excuse me. - Well? - Well what? l introduce you to Antonio and a day later you go to dinner? What kind of joke is this? He stopped by the agency to drop off some pictures.. ..and wanted to talk about you, so here we are. Strange. Lucia has never talked about you. Well, you know, she's a woman who always surprises you. l know. l know her very well. l guess you're with Maria. lf by ''with'' you mean we're getting married in a month,.. ..then, l'd say yes, we're together. - Does Lucia know? - Are you joking? Shit... Thanks. - A lovely bouquet... - What wine is it? - A '97 Chardonnay, really nice. - '97? - Uh... '97. Paolo doesn't know anything and he can't know anything.. ..about Antonio and me, got it? Fine. So, now you.... Now you go out there and pretend you're his girlfriend. - Thank you. - No, no, Maria, come on! Gustavo... Lucia! This time.... Evidently our destinies are tied to bathrooms, right? Too bad this is the women's room! l know, but it's also the only one with clean toilet seats. Next time, why don't we make a date? l don't know, maybe in the bathroom at your house. - When will you call me? - Never. She's not interested. Well, nevertheless... - And how did you two meet? - By chance. - Yeah, by chance... - At the agency, by chance. Who could imagine, eh? Sometimes you think you know someone, but, instead,.. ..you realize you know nothing. Let's hope at least this sea bass is fresh, right, darling? You talking to me? Nowadays real sea bass is only found in.... lt's not important. Excuse me, there's something l have to do, l should go, darling. Antonio is like that. Maybe it's better if l go with him. Ciao. - Antonio, hold on! Let's talk. - About what? What? About paying me to win over a woman who's about to get married? lt's a wedding, not a infectious disease. You told me all about Maria: ..her shoe size, her astrological sign,.. ..the books and music she likes... And not that she's getting married? - lt didn't seem relevant. - Sure, not relevant. Like sleeping with her boyfriend, l suppose. Listen, you don't understand, l just wanted Maria to.. ..see she was making a mistake, that Paolo wasn't the right guy. lt's not like you think. But who do you think you are? You don't know anything, you know nothing. You're just a stupid conceited woman who thinks she can manipulate people. - l just wanted to.... - What did you want? What? You demand, you command... ''Do this, say that''. You know something? l don't need your help to win over the heart of a woman. l can do that just fine by myself. l'll finish the job, Lucia, but this time l'll do it my way. That way you can have your Paolo. Maria, hi, it's me. lf you get this message, call me back, please. l just wanted to say sorry about last night and.... Nothing. Bye. Hello, who is it? Angela? l've had it with you! You don't write, you don't call, you don't show your face,.. ..but when it's time to go to the bank to get my salary, you're there! Disgusting! You took it all, why not throw yourself under a tram? Yeah, that sounds like a good idea,.. ..but maybe we could talk about it later, or l could come over. Have you gone crazy? Are you taking the piss? l'll sue you, l'll kill you, you can just fuck off,.. ..and l hope a meteorite strikes you on the head and crushes you, got it? Shit! And don't call anymore! l'd built the perfect device,.. ..a way to take destiny where l wanted it to go: ..towards Paolo. l admit there was something morally reprehensible in all this. But time would have shown l was right. lt was for a good cause, deep down,.. ..and nobody would have been really hurt. l just wanted to be happy. Hello? Oh, hi. When? Okay, at the park. Well? What did you want to tell me? l'm more confused than ever. l know, we already talked about it,.. ..but now Maria is growing more distant and l feel miserable. And at the same time l can't stop thinking about you. Lucia, l know you well, l know it's the same for you, too. - You really think you know me? - Sure. Then let's hear, how do l dress? How? Like.... Normal, right? And how do l talk? Slowly, quickly, in a low voice, high? What do l know? Normal. Whenever l'm nervous, what do l do? Sneeze, scratch, jump? - What is this, a game? - Yes, but it's over, Paolo. See, the difference is you and l are just friends,.. ..but you love Maria. And she loves you. No, she doesn't love me anymore. She says she's confused,.. ..that maybe she's no longer sure she wants to get married,.. ..that maybe things were a little rushed, that.... That's what Maria says, and what do you want? Well... All l know is l don't want to lose her. So go to her and tell her what you told me. - Just the second part. - What? Oh, yeah, sure, just the second part. Okay, people, the ad campaign for Celluvia is off without a hitch. The commercial, on the other hand, is still out to sea. Can anyone tell me why? Lucia? Yes. We still don't have an alternative solution. Could you explain? We gave the client hundreds of ideas, settings for the Celluvia girls,.. ..but we haven't gotten any feedback to help us choose. ln other words: the client didn't like your proposals. Well? What are you going to do? We're evaluating new ideas, we'll solve the problem before long. Have you at least approved the cast? - No. There have been a few delays.... - Your delays, Lucia. You've been neglecting you work for weeks. Now, either you get on board or it's going to end badly. Got it? l want the idea by this evening, if not, you're out. l'll get someone who's not remodeling their bathroom. Excuse me. Bloody hell! - You're remodeling your bathroom? - Yeah, in a way. lt did not come out very well. All right, let's see... An original idea, outrageous, offbeat. Easy to say. l'm not exactly selling sexy cruises or sadomasochist kits! What is it? Aren't you feeling well? Ginevra, where did we put those audition tapes? They should be in the file, why? - Hi - Hi... They gave me this address, but is this a house? No. Well yes, actually it's an office. My office, but we live here temporarily. - Antonio Sardella lives here? - Yes, he does. But he's not home right now. No. Actually, he took away a lot of stuff so l'm not sure he'll be back. Did he say where he was going? Did he mention London? London? - But you're that one from the agency! - Yes. - Lucia. - Nice to meet you. l'm Simone,.. ..Antonio's brother-in-law. My wife left me.. ..and so here l am. Do you have a message for me? - From my wife? - No, Antonio. Oh, sorry! Yes. Yeah, sure. He said.. ..that he finished the job. Just like you wanted. Then he added something, he said you'd understand: ..''Great tits''. l got it, thanks. By the way, don't call here, the phone's broken, unfortunately,.. ..and so.... Okay, yes, thanks so much. Goodbye, bye, bye. Lucia, we did it! The client is totally satisfied with your idea, really, enthusiastic. We lost some time, but now.. ..if we plan it right, it won't be a problem. - No? Aren't you happy? - Yes, l'm happy. - See you later, okay? - What happiness! - Hello? - Hello! The first thing: l'm really upset with you. You left the restaurant.. ..without paying your bill or saying goodbye. Can't do that. Could have skipped the California Chardonnay, you know it's pricey. But where did you go? l had a ton of things to do. l haven't stopped for weeks. And here l get to the second point. Tonight l have to try my dress at the dressmaker's and.... Just a sec. l wanted to ask you to come with me, to give me a hand.. ..with the finishing touches, the details... Maria... Okay, l'll come. See you tonight. Okay. See you at 7 o'clock at the shop. Thanks, kisses, bye. Guess l'll have to do without this marvelous train. Paolo want to use the motorcycle instead of a car. ldiotic, huh? l said yes just because l didn't want a scene. You know what Paolo's like, don't you? Yes, you do. Go ahead, ask what you've never dared to ask me. Well, after all that's happened, l thought.... - All that's happened would be Antonio? - Yes. Actually, l have to admit that Antonio is fantastic. For a second l thought l was falling in love with him, then.... Sorry, could you let it out a minute, l can't breathe, please? Then l thought about my life without Paolo and.. ..that's not what l want. You know, l feel so safe with him, l can make lots of plans... Okay, maybe he's not the perfect man,.. ..we are really difference, but.... What pleasure is there in living with a carbon copy? But that day at the agency you told me that.... Forget what l told you, l never remember,.. ..l say so many things, how could l remember them all? So... - You and Antonio haven't.... - No. Sorry... Besides Antonio and l are too alike. Besides, a guy who wears nail polish is absurd, right? Yes, l admit it, the night l ran into you at the restaurant.. ..l got a little angry. l even thought that you were hiding something from me. What a fool, huh? Oh, well... Then l saw him leave that way... and l understood. - Understood what? - That he loves you. Loves me? And l think you'd be perfect together. My goodness, your as white as a ghost,.. ..l don't want any ghosts at my wedding, go use a sunlamp. You have one message. Message one. Lucia, hi. lt's Paolo. Sorry for not calling you before, it's been kind of a hectic time. Maria and l finally got back together,.. ..we talked, it was really engrossing. You were right. lt looks like everything's fine and it's mostly thanks to you, thanks. - This is your new desk. - Thanks, Gianni. Welcome to the clan, Ginevra. Gloria, your new assistant. - Has she been like that long? - Since this morning. Gloria, go get a cappuccino for Lucia. - lt's not in my job description.... - Lukewarm, not too foamy. Thanks. Hi, Lucia. l was thinking about giving you a week off. As a reward. - lmmediately, if you want. - Thanks, Gianni. - Not at all. - Maybe another time, okay? - Okay, as you like. Thanks, Ginevra. l'm not Ginevra, l'm Gloria. The new assistant.... Thanks, Gloria. Dearest Lucia, Antonio is at the airport. Check-in 116. Gate 9. At 2:30 pm. Then he's leaving. Just thought maybe you'd want to know. Bye, Maria. lt's so late! Gianni! That vacation... l accept, thanks. You're welcome. But what are you doing here? l thought you'd left. l thought you were leaving. Maria told me that.... That airports bring out the best in people. Yeah. l practically parked in the middle of nowhere. 40 minutes, 8,50 euros. Will you tell me why were here? For something l wouldn't have missed for the world. - Let's go. - No way, sorry. No, eh! l still have 23 minutes of paid parking. Not even a tow truck could move me. And then you know: ..nowadays, real cappuccino can only be found at airports. lt's strange, you spend your whole life following one dream.. ..and then you realize that your oasis was just one step away,.. ..that you just had to stretch out your hand.. ..to feel the waves skimming along the shore.. ..and your heart says: ''We're here''. l got here, finally. From here on it'll be another story. l've learned to love. l've learned that in this life it's not important where you get to,.. ..but the roads you travel on. l've learned that the best part you can play.. ..is your own. And above all, l learned not to fear the unsightly effects of cellulite. Cellulite is a devious enemy,.. ..that strikes the subcutaneous connective tissues.. ..and requires truly effective action. Celluvia is the new frontier in the fight against cellulite. Celluvia acts deep down, on the interstitial tissues,.. ..draining liquids, restoring sluggish circulation.. ..and deflating the fatty cells that cause orange peel-like skin. You will see results after applying it for just 15 days. Your thighs will thank you. For me? Celluvia!
