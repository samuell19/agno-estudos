"reverend william wilkins, The charismatic young minister Of the abundant love Church of god outside Fort worth disappeared Last week amid speculation Of embezzlement. The mid-size congregation In the affluent neighborhood Has grown steadily since..." Blah, blah, blah, blah. "According to sources, Over $500,000 could be missing From generous donations made Over the past five years. Wilkins is rumored to have fled After the fbi began questioning Members of the church About the missing cash." So, scott's got This guy's cross. And got his money. He is this guy. "this was the second brush With the law for wilkins. He was previously accused of... Rape...by one of the Parishioners, rachael bridges, Who later withdrew her Allegations. The 26-year-old bridges Committed suicide shortly after The shocking revelation Of what wilkins labeled Their "affair". My god. "sources believe it was Bridges' death that put The church, as well as wilkins' Colorful lifestyle, Under a microscope, resulting In an anonymous tip that all Might not be well With the church coffers." When did this happen? Three years ago. That's him. ( tv playing ) You sure dr. andy would Approve of us here like this? Come on, david, stop. need to talk to you. It's about julia. She was raped A couple of months ago. But she didn't make Any reports. He'll get off, then. He was accused of raping Another woman two years ago. Acquitted or convicted? Never went to trial. It's irrelevant, then. You know that, rebecca. do, but he was also Suspected of embezzling From his church and using An alias. Any proof? No. he fled. No one from the church Pursued it, but the fbi Did open a file. Can she prove he's The same guy? ' M not sure. You don't have much. Well, i could notify The fbi. Yeah, you could, and they Might send someone out To question him. The next day, he could be Gone again. just can't accept it. There has to be something We can get on this guy. How many juries Have you watched make A rational decision? If she isn't beat up, And there isn't a rape kit Or a police report... know, i know, i know. It's horrible. She just wanted to pretend It never happened, and now There's no evidence at all. And embezzlement? You know the statistics. Somebody on the jury always Questions, "is it so bad To take from people who Can afford it?" What am i gonna tell her? How is she gonna get justice? The money. Get the people he stole from To push the issue. That's your best chance of A charge that will stick. David? ( sighs ) Thank you. Tell julia she can Call me anytime.

' M thinking about moving To the neighborhood, And obviously my first Priority is finding My new church. And yours--well, it has Such a welcoming name. Well, it's a wonderful Congregation. I'm proud to say i've served This parish for many years, And quite recently i've run it On my own when one of our Ministers was transferred. This particular branch Of our church was built in 1982 When a boom of new residences Necessitated a more Conveniently located parish. Been growing ever since. And it's been my good fortune To have many novices serve Under me and flourish. We at abundant love Pride ourselves in welcoming Everyone with open arms, Both those who wish to Contribute their time-- That man in that photo. I think i knew him.
