[Music] vatsburg pennsylvania and i moved into this apartment about three weeks ago and for the past week and a half i've been hearing strange sounds coming from these wooded areas out back in my apartment building in the middle of the night why would anyone or anything be out here at three and four in the morning making sounds i mean there's nothing out here except just acres and acres of woods that isn't me he looks just like me he says he has a daughter named sarah he says his name's daniel blanche that's my name but i never filmed that that isn't me friend of mine bought that movie from this website and he sent me a message asking why i never told him that i was in this movie and it's because i'm not in the movie i guess that's where he bought it from and this whole thing is just impossible um the tape that i'm on was captured through a missing police officer's body camera footage so i'm trying to see if i can find like a company that was behind releasing his body camera footage but there's nothing on here i've been looking into this all day i haven't found much i mean even the details and to the missing deputy are vague i don't know if i should be scared i don't know what this is the more i think about it the more i realize how crazy this whole thing is like i'm on footage that i never filmed it's me there's other people on that tape like myself that probably don't even know they're on it so it's one in the morning right now i'm gonna get some sleep and then tomorrow i'm gonna see if i can figure out who these other people are and see if they know anything about this i did a reverse image search of the other people that were on that footage and i only got one hit and it was this guy uh his name's james darvin he looks exactly like one of the guys that was on that tape he's got some contact information on his social media page so i'm gonna reach out to him and see what he knows about this hello hello uh is this james yes who is this um do you know a person named jay or alex you do yeah okay um my name is daniel blanche we don't know each other there's this footage that i came in contact with and i think it has you and your friend alex and a guy named jay were you guys ever in a a movie did you ever star in a horror movie it's better if i just show you i'm willing to come to you i'll i'll meet you and just show you this footage would you be okay with that i'll give you my email address and you can contact me first so you know i'm not i know this is kind of a weird situation this footage is weird it's real i'm on it and i didn't know i was on it i think you might be on it and you're unaware of it as well so i've been emailing back and forth with james for four days i sent him some stills of the footage and he just sent this email over it says yeah it's definitely strange i guess we could meet at gaspin park near my house if you want to show me the full video seems like a long drive just to show me a video but that's up to you i'm not sure about going to maryland with you to look into this i don't exactly know you and this is all very confusing it could just be a prank or some sort of mix up i'll send over the address if you definitely want to meet up let me know thanks i'm gonna go meet him tomorrow um he's about three hours from me he agrees that's him on the footage i'm gonna show him the entire footage and see if he's interested in heading down the dark bluff maryland that's where deputy leo cole's body camera was found and see if he wants to head down there and look into this so it's 3 15. james said he will meet me here at three i hope he's still coming i hope i didn't come all this way for nothing james hey what's up thanks for coming man nice to meet you man this is alex alex yeah i recognize him from the footage oh yeah sorry i hope you guys don't mind i'm just kind of documenting this whole thing when we talked to my phone you didn't say nothing about a camera though thank you guys for coming to meet me to look into this yeah james did you show him any of the stills from the footage i said i briefly talked to him about some of the stuff i haven't showed him anything yet what about the other guy in the video with youtube jay his name was i don't even have any friends named jay i never met the dude my life ladies what's up dude let's go what's up man fire that laptop up there's no doubt about it hey alex just like carter his name's alex the other guy's name's james he looks just like you this could be one of the biggest we chase i hope so man i mean you can't deny it in 2015 there was a young girl named megan who killed herself and her family in their house at 11 628 hangman road in dark bluff maryland and the house was demolished shortly after and then a year later the anniversary of that incident residents on hangman road were calling into the dark bluff pd claiming that the house that was demolished mysteriously reappeared so there's this deputy named leo cole who was sent to look into this where the [ __ ] are you getting all this information just listen just listen i i know it sounds crazy so this deputy shows up at this house that it's not supposed to exist anymore he goes in he finds this diary about this little girl and she found this weird videotape in her bedroom she watched it and watching that tape is what caused her to kill her family and that tape that she watched is the footage that we're all on i know this doesn't make any sense deputy that went to look into the house that reappeared is missing now and the footage that you just saw is shot from his body camera if this is about a cop wouldn't this be all over the news we would have heard about this i agree apparently that footage was like released by some ex-police officer at the same department he worked at what are they just trying to bury this it's some it seems like it's a cover-up i i don't know cover up a what how do we know you didn't make that move how you know i didn't make it because you're both on it how could i have footage of both of you seriously i mean you you come in with this movie then you're sticking this camera in our [ __ ] face and [ __ ] like what i don't know man let's go man this must be some type of scam or something else do you explain what's on the table who would i want to scam you i don't even know you alex come on man alex james come on man this dude clearly wants some money or something i don't know i don't want anything you explain what's on the tape man i don't i don't understand what could i learn from this i don't know you guys what do i gain look man just give me a minute to talk to him i'll see if i can come on james i just just give him i'm sorry but he's got a point man i mean you're coming approaching us with this [ __ ] talking about cover-ups and i mean it's just oh this whole situation's weird it's weird but you i mean you admit that you in there that's me on there i just want to go look into this i feel like i mean i get yeah it's me it's him on there but with technology nowadays man i don't know what to believe i don't feel comfortable doing this without him i mean i don't know you man i don't know you i don't know him none of us know each other we're all tied by this tape well man all i can tell you is good luck but all right thanks for coming out here man i'm i'm not a part of this [ __ ] i'm sorry i said good luck man so it's been two days since i met with james and alex and i've decided i'm gonna go look into this uh it's too strange um it's too impossible and considering what the footage depicts it's actually kind of scary so i printed out a map of dark bluff i pack in my bag i took off work and tomorrow i'm gonna head down and look into this and see what everything means hello james what's up man i know man me too i was gonna head down there tomorrow i'm just gonna try to look into this i don't know what i'm gonna find you should man i mean i would rather not go alone i'm gonna book a hotel tonight probably like two or three days tell me about it i probably watched it a hundred times i mean literally this is the craziest thing that's ever happened to me in my life come on me man let's figure this out yeah but you know if you don't you you're always going to wonder about this i mean i know i would seriously all right let's do it man i'll text you my address and you can meet me here in the morning what time works for you like eight okay well what about alex you think he'll come all right well it's me and you man all right i'll see you in the morning all right bye james yeah all right i'm coming man it's good to see my gate locking device works yeah nice secure filming yeah i mean i want to document this whole journey man is that all right with you yeah i mean yeah it's all right i got my stuff in the truck should i grab it uh no you can leave it in there come on in real quick i'm gonna hit the road before the traffic so i'm gonna finish packing up good to see you again man thank you can you get anything you want out of the fridge all right thanks i gotta put a few more things in my bag i'll be right back i'm actually good though i already i had a coffee and like a small sandwich before came out ma'am i'm all right how crazy is this whole thing man um it's pretty crazy man i mean did you reach back out to me i mean i know we don't know each other that well but somehow this tate knew both of us yeah i mean the whole situation creeped me out i just i want to get a better understanding of what the hell is going on and why i'm in it yeah i don't know what to expect from all of this but thanks for coming along man what hotel we staying at when we get there um i actually couldn't find any hotels this is like a pretty small rural town there's not many options um but remember how i told you about that young girl on hangman road in dark bluff maryland who killed her family after watching the tape we're on yeah it's something you don't forget yeah i remember so i did some research and i i don't think that house on hangman road is the first place this tape has been i found a cabin in dark bluff where a similar incident took place and i've reached out to the lady who rents it she's going to let us stay there if this tape has already been at this cabin somehow it's already connected it's already appeared there i get the process so i mean i i understand that but that'll creep you out of you i'm willing to do whatever it is to figure out how i'm on this tape are you okay with staying there before we head out i don't want you to feel uncomfortable about this and look man if you feel uncomfortable at any point let me know we will leave marilyn welcomes us we're heading over to dark bluff to look into the murder suicide on hang manor road okay do you know about that yeah i remember when it happened do you know about the vhs tape that she watched that was the reason for doing what she did the hs tape yeah i thought she did it because her parents were trying to keep her from seeing some boy or something really you said dark bluff is a strange town well i mean fog randomly moves in and out and it's down it seems like it's thundering all the time really i don't know it's just a strange little town i guess wow this is that random fog that lady was talking about this [ __ ] came out of nowhere yeah and as soon as we hit dark bluff it's kind of creepy i thought she was bullshitting maybe there is something strange going on in this little town that almost felt like the appropriate way to begin this weird-ass adventure it's moving out now kevin should be at the end of this road should be here we are this place is hidden yeah that's why i was saying i wanted to drive you got everything that's not the cabin right there uh nah this is the cabin right here that's like a garage they use for storage or something [ __ ] they got a pool huh uh yeah is there a lock box with a key in it or do you have the key on you uh no the owner said the door will be unlocked unlock that's what she said it's a lot nicer than i expected yeah look at this view how did you find this place uh i just did some research into the town and i read about what happened here i knew it had to be connected somehow so what's the room situation gonna be like and i don't know if you noticed but i didn't see tv out there yeah i noticed uh i'll take this room does that work for you i'm not getting any signal on my phone anywhere in here dude yeah i meant to mention that i mean we're almost 70 acres of forest but i got a hot spot on my phone i'll give you the password later just remind me uh all the clocks are wrong hey piano it's very isolated out here actually more so than i even thought it was going to be oh what the hell crow okay this is the gallow creek cabin in dark bluff maryland hey james yeah i'm gonna start putting some of this stuff in the fridge you mind if i put some of your waters in yeah that's fine put the lunch meat in there too please figure they can start to get cold damn um now that we're here i mean we're both trying to figure this out i need to know what happened here in this cabin yeah so there was a lady named rose who rented this property for a number of years she uh she ran a daycare out of here she also gave piano lessons to a lot of the kids she watched um she had like two or three kids of her own that lived here with her and in october of 96 she was watching i think three or four kids plus her own were here and she closed all the windows in the cabin and removed the exhaust pipe on the hot water heater releasing carbon monoxide in here killing all the kids she then went down to the pull out back and drowned herself and she left some note talking about some videotape she watched that made her do this and i know it sounds crazy but i think that's the videotape we're on the one she watched i i don't understand where this tape came from it just feels like it appeared out of nowhere that's what we're here to find out just try to talk to a few people and see what they know about this excuse me sir my name is daniel how you doing jack nice to meet you this is james um we're in dark bluff looking into an incident that took place here in 2015 on hangman road do you know anything about that i guess you're talking about that girl that killed herself and her family yeah i think her name was megan yeah i actually went to school with megan i mean we weren't close or anything like that she wasn't there that long it was something about she put on her dad's record player and put some vintage music on before she did it i actually don't know much about it okay i remember hearing that she put their bodies in the closets of the house or something like that so megan turned on her dad's record player before she killed her family had it playing in the house during yeah man it's pretty creepy [ __ ] do you know why she did it her parents were abusing her or something like that and that's what i heard do you know why she did it honestly i have no clue did they ever release that well i just assume crazy people do crazy things do you know about the vhs tape that megan found in her house that was the reason for doing what she did vhs tape she wrote in her diary that this tape was the reason she killed her family it does remind me of a babysitter i once had she told us about this cursed tape that would somehow appear you didn't know where you didn't know why really but you had this uncontrollable urge to watch it said once you watched it it kind of got into your head why would a tape make her do that and the scary part was that if you saw yourself on the tape yeah supposedly you were already dead you already did i remember this kid named zach i went to high school with he was into ghost hunting and stuff like that he was obsessed with it after the house got demolished him and a couple friends used to go down there at like 3 a.m and perform seances and stuff like that why would they go down at 3am supposedly that's the time when making killed her family where did she hear this story yet i don't know she was probably just making it all up she used to try to scare us all the time so how can i get in contact with her to talk with her about this i don't know man i was 10 years old okay i don't even remember her name what about leo cole the deputy that went missing from down here what do you know about that he ran away with some mistress i thought i've never really heard of that i don't really watch the news that much so you never saw the body camera footage from the night he disappeared no this is the first i'm hearing about this really where did you guys get this information i see his wife around town every now and then why don't you guys go and contact her hello hello ma'am um is this nancy cole who's calling my name is daniel blanche uh i'm here with my friend james we're in dark bluff looking into the disappearance of leo cole was he your husband i'm sorry i gotta go ma'am that's gotta be her yeah hey man look at this look at this this is from the missing deputy's wife now she wants to talk yeah i guess so so how far does it look did you find it on the map it doesn't look like it's that far from us okay but it looks like it's a dead end what time is it she said meet there at 11. it's 9 30 now all right she's going to come man why would she set this up and knock him i'm just saying there's lights there's lights you think that's her it's got to be her keep the camera down put the camera down i am i am i got it she was already sketchy on the phone i i don't want her to see we're filming her you think she's gonna get in the trunk put the camera down i am it's down what is she doing she's about to get out just just act cool i don't i don't want her to know we're filming her she could give us some some information here uh she she's coming over to the truck just she here she comes together she's going down nancy thank you for meeting with us who are you guys i'm daniel this is james we're looking into your husband's disappearance um well the night he disappeared i don't need you looking into this let me explain he even disappeared and i was given no answers yeah but do you know what happened to him i have no clue what happened to him and at this point i'm not even sure i want to know it leaves me a little bit of hope look whatever you guys are trying to find stop i don't have much information but there is something strange going on here i know that's why we're here look on the night your husband disappeared he watched the videotape and listen i don't know you guys and i don't know what you're talking about but you need to go back to wherever you came from and leave this alone goodbye nancy don't contact me again do you know about the tape your husband watched on the night he vanished what the hell was that a waste of time she was scared of something i feel like i should be scared of something she had to be overreacting i was just thinking how crazy this whole situation is i know you probably thought i was crazy when i reached out to you and you know i appreciate you coming on this strange journey with me here to look into this i'm glad you're as interested in this as i am it doesn't make sense what do you do for a living i'm a student right now i do odd jobs just to make it by what are you studying uh mechanical engineering oh nice yeah it's good to learn trade though how about yourself um i'm working at a furniture moving company right now it's it's kind of wack it doesn't pay great but you know it's a job for now yeah i've been there i really want to do like documentaries something in that field explains the camera exactly you married you got kids no i'm just playing the field living a single life tiring yourself uh yeah i got a daughter sarah and uh made her mother on and off off right now was that the same name on the tape sarah yeah see that's the most interesting part of it to me is that certain aspects of it were accurate you know what i mean i my daughter was on it her name's sarah her name was sarah on there yeah my version that i was on alex was there my truck was there exactly it's like certain pieces match up so whoever is responsible has to maybe know us i don't know i know it doesn't make sense man anyway i'm gonna head in for this rain hits you staying out here yeah i'm gonna finish my drink up i'll head in after all right man i'll see you tomorrow all right good night man uh damn you left this thing outside cause i got rained on man hello oh [ __ ] is somebody out there daniel hello if you're messing with me man this ain't cool james who are you james james you still out

on man let's go back up you are you okay hey hey dude what's up feeling all right oh i got a headache man i can't find my glasses anywhere either right i don't know how that one i mean maybe they could be outside or something what that happened last night uh i had a problem as a kid man i used to sleepwalk it it's been like 20 years since it happened but my parents actually found me in the woods one time i was missing for a day sleepwalking yeah i just woke up in the middle of the woods i panicked i was like 10 years old i had no clue where anybody was they hadn't sent out rescue dogs and search dogs to find me and i really haven't had a problem since then they gave me medication to stay home to help me with the whole situation i you know i don't really remember everything that happened last night i just remember you standing in front of me asking me if i was all right yeah i went out to find the camera and because i i didn't know where i left it i saw the light shining yeah i'm sorry if it's inconvenienced for you i mean no you're all right man just you feeling all right he was standing right there so the glasses shoo i guess that little [ __ ] wasn't dead what was james knocking on this door for last night what the hell is that christmas tree it's kind of uh he said he hasn't slept walking 20 years and it just picks up all of a sudden once we get here i think there might be more to it maybe something to do with this tape i don't know how far down he went last night there's no way he came all the way down here it would have been pitch black that's as far down as the land goes uh hello hey uh i can't this weekend i'm away looking into something right now you wouldn't understand no kate i'm not it's something strange that i discover i honestly don't even know what it means yet let me talk to her hey sweetheart so i'm away this weekend working okay but i'll i'll be back on tuesday and i'll get you we can go roller skating if the weather's good okay i love you see you soon okay bye damn not anywhere man no i didn't see him down there at all it started to rain while i was out there [ __ ] who you calling i'm calling a guy named steven ritz he was uh the mayor of dark bluff when the incidental hangman or road happened i'll call him again hello uh hello is this steven ritz were you the mayor of dark bluff maryland in 2016 my name is daniel i'm looking into the disappearance of deputy leo cole more specifically the tape he watched the night he vanished uh look i don't know what you're talking about okay so what about the murder suicide on hangman road you know anything about that what is this all about who are you mr ritz um i'm the tape that little girl watched the night she killed her family i'm on that tape the tape deputy leo cole watch the night he vanished that's the same tape i'm on that i know this sounds crazy don't call this number again goodbye mr ritz dude what the hell are they hiding what are people doing in a town like this can you mean besides cover up disappearances i don't know i mean there was no bar no strip club not even a town card yeah i don't plan on being here long enough to find out get in here try to figure this out and we can leave look if we don't figure it out all right man i'm gonna head to bed all right all right man good second day hey no weird sleep walking tonight we're all [ __ ] fine i don't know what happened to james last night it was like he was in like a trance or something i don't know if it has anything to do with this this tape this cabin i knew coming here things could get weird i was prepared i believe in this stuff i believe there's something really strange going on here i don't know how he feels but no matter how strange it gets i'm not scared i i want answers i've become obsessed with this it was loud as [ __ ] it woke me up they're looking for somebody all right i thought i heard a piano there it is what james james what are you sleepwalking again damn what are you doing man uh you're sorry man i couldn't sleep uh i'm gonna head back to bed sorry man just do me a favor just whatever you're doing just hold off to the bottom all right man what the [ __ ] what was that holy [ __ ] okay okay i guess you're trying to contact us we're just trying to figure out how we're connected to all of this figure out what this tape means we don't mean any disrespect oh we just want to figure out how we're connected none of this makes any sense [Music] i'm sorry i thought i heard a noise i just i just came back all night kind of freaking me out i know man i'm heading back to bed holy [ __ ] so i thought that piano riff that james or whoever that was at the piano last night was playing sounded familiar i was right this is deputy leo cole in the house on hangman a road the night he watched that tape listen [Music] it's the same exact tune i i don't know what this means there's no way that's just a coincidence i can't tell james about last night just yet i don't want to scare him too soon without being able to at least explain what this all means i should have never even told him about what happened in this cabin i guess that figure last night must have been rose the lady who drowned herself in the pool here and i could have swore when i was sleeping i felt like cold fingers like running down my face i don't know okay man i'm coming how are you doing last night all that boys out there couldn't sleep man playing the piano sorry about that i was just up trying to figure out what we're gonna do today so what are we doing um so from everything i gathered the house on hangman road is the last place this tape was at when you're positive this is where the house was sitting this was 11 628 hangman a road they tore it down in 2015. i think it was like the day after megan killed her family in it it's like they were just trying to get rid of it so if they demolish this house then why didn't they demolish the cabin we're staying in that's a great question this is the last place that the tape was so i figured find the house find the tape deputy leo cole did i'm not getting anything on my gps it's not on there at all it's like they don't even want it to be found what a neighbor say on the tape that it appeared at night maybe it only appears at night yeah he did call in at night looking for what anything i mean something that proves deputy leo cole was here that night james you see anything over there james james jane we can't leave what james you already did yeah i'm good man i don't i don't see anything over here there's nothing over here dude are you sure i kind of got a headache man i just can we get out of here all right yeah i'm feeling better man oh good i just opened up all the windows we can get some fresh air in here james so in the 143 years that dark bluff has existed there's been eight incidences similar to what happened here and on hangman road like all of them are like murder suicide type where's that dark bluff map at so the first incident was here in 1980 second was here in 84. third one was here in 87. fourth one was here in 90. fifth one was here in 93. the sixth one was here at the cabin we're at in 1996 the seventh was here in 2007 and the eighth was here what megan did on hangman road in 2015. think they all seen the tape no how is that even possible wait a second so first second third what are you doing to fourth fifth to sixth seventh what the [ __ ] to eight i knew this looked familiar look that's from the footage you were in on that tape holy [ __ ] it's the same symbol how's this connected what about the bottom piece bottom piece it looks like it goes from the cabin where ahead to the house on hangman road the hell does that mean well what's that centerpiece that's the autumnwood cemetery what come here you got to look at this what is it investigation continues in a chilling grave robbery the remains of a woman stolen sometime last week the hole is perfectly rectangular five and a half feet deep the dirt left in neat piles to either side it appears that somebody had taken the body especially a century's old town plot with so many memories it's a very well visited cemetery it's a you know it's the main cemetery for this town with motive or even reasoning still unanswered by police it's an act that remains too many a mystery anyone with information on who dug up this grave is asked to call police what was that that's the autumnwood cemetery what you know what we gotta do so what does all this mean i don't know i mean this tape just mysteriously appears in someone's house yeah they kill their families kill themselves and then they're all buried in the autumnwood cemetery then someone or something comes and exhumes their bodies this is [ __ ] crazy it's like the tape is just used as a way to get people to the cemetery how do we know it's not also used as a way to give people a dark bluff like us we're gonna have to turn the light off on the camera put the night vision setting on we'll get in here look around we'll get out i'm not going in what i'm not going in man what the hell are you talking about that's what we're here for no that's what you're here for not me james this could be this could connect everything yeah it could we have to go or it could just be us wandering around the [ __ ] cemetery in the middle of the night you're gonna make me go in there by myself that's up to you unbelievable give me the goddamn camera i can't see [ __ ] where's the new vision setting i don't even know what i'm looking for something in here has to has to be related there's gotta be something i don't see any open graves i don't know how big the cemetery is i don't see [ __ ] in here let me head back which way did i come in i came into the left over there that house what is there a house in a cemetery hello is anyone down there james james hello james can you hear me yeah what are you doing what i i'm in the cemetery i i found an abandoned house back in here i'm looking around to see if i can find anything what chase hello james oh [ __ ] what oh oh [ __ ] what happened nothing i didn't see anything man i didn't find anything did you call my phone while i was in there no i don't even have my phone on me why nothing i thought i thought i heard it ring i i just want to get back and get some sleep uh i'm i'm sorry about this so you didn't see anything no there's another dead end man hopefully within the next 24 hours and this all starts to make sense it all starts to connect somehow i mean i knew coming here that we may not get answers but now i can't accept that i mean as scared as i am i gotta finish this sounded like the pool cover was open here it is again james whatever that was it's close footprints this can't be from the pool [Music] hello what is going on here hello what [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] james i thought something was leaking uh uh i went to check it i heard a noise there's nothing out here man come on let's go back in what every night you're hearing something dude what the [ __ ] is going on i don't know man maybe i'm just a little on all in the house edge know it had to be the rain i'll clean it up i don't know what the [ __ ] going on nothing man no i'm just trying to document everything i don't know what's going on with you last two nights no i know i'm gonna freak me out with us every night i know i was just on edge from last night i'm sorry man i'm going back to bed put the camera down let's go to sleep jesus i just don't want to be on camera every day like what i didn't [ __ ] come here for that the problem my problem yeah dude you guys going to cemeteries in the middle of the night i mean you're roaming around at night i don't know what the [ __ ] you're doing to me what about you you're down in the basement at 3am knocking on some door in the corner i mean i felt real comfortable we already discussed that okay i thought you'd be more
