Good morning. Would you be the headmaster? It's hot. You'd better come inside! What are you doing here? I was assigned to teach here by the Ministry of Education. I have the letter from the Ministry. I received all the forms. Have you ever taught before? I taught in the temple for over ten years. So why did you leave the monkhood? Did you misbehave? No. I was never in any trouble. So what was the reason? Why did you leave? I... I taught there for over ten years. I tried to teach the children about the world, about how to lead their lives - how to survive in the real world. But I realised... I myself had little idea what normal life, or what the real world was like. So I decided to leave. You've come here to find out about the real world? This place is dying. It's slowly dying. And we're all dying too. It's the heat. It bakes the life out of everything. The rains get less each year. This year was worse than last. The crops shrivelled and died before they could be harvested. So people leave. More of them go every year. The boys... go off to the city. They drive taxis. Or they ride motorbikes. And the girls... they work in factories. If they're pretty... they say they work in a hotel. But that's not really what they're doing. They're selling their bodies. And they leave the old people behind. We used to have five teachers here. Now there's just three. For ten years now, we haven't been given a proper budget. We don't have enough textbooks. Three years ago we were sent a computer. But the electricity here's no good. So the computer blew up. And we've never had the funds to repair it. We've had new teachers here before - freshly graduated. - All full of energy. They think they can come in and change everything... Bring new inspiration to the classroom. They have their new methods. But soon... when they see they can't do anything, they blame me. They blame the children. They blame the ministry. Then they leave. I'll take you to your room. Term starts tomorrow. Good morning, children. Good morning, headmaster. I want to welcome you all back for the start of a new term. Today we will meet a new teacher who is joining the school. I'd like to introduce Mr. Preecha. Please let's welcome him to our school. Good morning, children. I'm Mr. Preecha. I will replace Miss Nittaya teaching this class. What about Miss Nittaya? Miss Nittaya will be teaching grade three. I'm pleased to see that you're so fond of Miss Nittaya, and I understand that you will miss her. But we'll still be able to see her every day. And most importantly... You don't know me. And I don't know you. So let's find out about you. If I point at you, I want you to stand up. Tell me your name, your age, and what you want to do when you grow up. Who shall we start with? Let's start with... you! Go. Good morning. My name is Mairn I'm twelve years old, and when I grow up I want to be a bank robber. You want to be a bank robber! And why's that? I want to be rich! You want to be rich? Okay. Sit down. If you want to be rich, the best way is to study hard. If you work hard, you can get a good job and a good salary. Or maybe... you think you'd like prison food? No, sir. Better think again, then! Who's next? Stand up. Good morning. I'm Bow. I'm twelve, and when I grow up I want to be Spiderman. You want to be Spiderman? Why do you want to be Spiderman? So I can catch bank robbers. - You mean him? - Yes. Good idea. You can sit down. Next person. Stand up. Just tell us your name, your age, and what you want to do when you grow up. No need to be shy. Speak up. She can't speak. She's just a dumb retard. Hey, quiet, quiet! Quiet please! Sit down. I hope I never see this sort of behaviour again. In this classroom, there will be no teasing. You will behave properly and politely. Boys and girls alike. And most importantly, we must look after each other. Do you understand? I said, do you understand? Answer me! Yes, sir. Now we'll carry on! You, girl! Keep going. Do it neatly. If you've finished your picture, you can go home. I said if you've finished your pictures... "Ja - 10 years old - when I grow up, I want to be a teacher." Let's grab her bag. She went into the forest! Why did she do that? Then follow her! No-one who goes into the forest has ever come out! Don't believe that rubbish! It's true! You go into the forest, you don't come out! It's haunted! That's stupid. My father says there are no ghosts. And my father knows everything. He has business in Bangkok. And he has a brand new Toyota. Your father just has an old tractor. We could catch her another day. Forget it! Come on. We'll go and get ice cream. I'll buy. But not for girls who are chicken! Let's go. Who would go in there? Everyone knows it's haunted. Hello. I'm the new teacher, Preecha. You must be Miss Nittaya. Yes. It looks like you caught me smoking! Don't worry. I won't tell. Do you want one? Better not. Don't tell me you never sneaked a smoke behind the temple. Oh yes. Caught by the abbot too. I got quite a thrashing. I keep trying to quit. But with a new class to teach... It's not the best time to quit. I know what you mean. On my first day, I managed to make a girl cry. Let me guess it was Pim? A small girl who sits at the back? That's right. Then you shouldn't worry. She'll burst into tears over anything. But she studies hard. I reckon the kids will find a few ways to tease the temple boy. I hadn't realised I was so famous. It's normal. When there's a new face in town, everybody wants to know all about them. So... How long have you been out of the temple? About six or seven months. And... What made you leave? The headmaster asked me the same question. Is it really that interesting? I don't know. You were there a good part of your life. You couldn't smoke. You couldn't drink. No women. And now... You're free. You can do whatever you want. I'd say that's pretty interesting. Okay. Sure you don't want one? What are you doing here? Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm going to school. This is my forest! That's nonsense! It isn't! I don't believe you. No-one can own a forest. Except maybe for the King. I live here. It's my forest! And no-one can come in! You're mad. You can't stop anyone. I can stop anyone. I could drown you in the lake and leave you for the fish to eat! Or I could throw you off a mountain and let your bones smash on the rocks! You're not scaring me. Why aren't you scared? Why would I be scared of a little boy showing his willy. Where're your clothes? Why do I have to wear clothes? This is my forest. I can do whatever I want. In that case, I'd better go. It's not right for a girl to be talking to a boy with no clothes on. If you want to be friends, you need to wear some clothes. Good. Get out! Go away! And if you come back, I'll kill you! This is my dog. My dog's name is Pookie. My dog is brown. He's a very nice dog, Pim. But where are his legs? He doesn't have any legs. Why doesn't he have legs? He was run over by a car. I'm sorry to hear that. Were you very sad? No. He smelled bad! Everyone give her a clap. Who's next? Who should we pick? Ja. Come up to the front. Let's have a look. What's your picture? Ja says this is a picture of a very beautiful forest. We can see the mountains, the sun, the trees and the flowers. There are rabbits and a lake. It's a very peaceful place. And it's a place where whatever you wish for can come true. I can see it's a very special place. If I could, I'd certainly like to visit it. One thing... I can see there's someone swimming in the picture. Is that you? No? Then... it must be a friend of yours, is it? Very good. Everyone give her a clap. You can go back to your seat. Next it's Waan's turn. Come to the front. Let's see what you've drawn. This is a picture of a girl who lives in the jungle. It's a scary place that no-one dares to go. She lives all on her own. She has no mother or father. She's mad. She can't speak, and she acts like a retard. No-one will play with her. She has a horrible, ugly face. All she can do is cry. Does everybody think that's what this picture shows? Because I see it a bit different. This picture is like me when I was a child. My home was very poor. I had no mother. I was all on my own. Just like in the picture. And I cried every day. There were many times I was very unhappy. But one day, I went to live at the temple. The monks helped me and taught me. They taught me to be a good person. They gave me the gift of being a teacher. So I can come and teach here. So I am absolutely sure that the child in that picture... will find hope, and will find happiness. She will have friends. And she will find all that she wishes for. Waan, can I keep this picture? Thank you. Please give her a clap. Where are you going? Don't you want to be our friend? You don't seem to have any friends. We just want to be your friends. Let's have a look. Don't be mean. What have you got in here? What have we got here? Why can't we just have a look? Oh, look what we've found. If you want it back, all you have to do is ask. Just ask us for it! Speak up! Why won't you talk to us? Oh look at this! Look! It's so pretty! What have you drawn? Lots of jungle animals! Are they your friends? Oh. It's torn! And it was so pretty! It's ruined now! What can we do? It's all spoiled. And it's torn again. Now you can't take it home to Mum. Her Mum's in the loony bin! Is that right? That's not it. She just ashamed to have a daughter who's a loony. Just a dumb retard. If she came out, her retard daughter would just embarrass her. You're probably right. That's why she has no friends! What's up? You're scared. I knew you were scared of me. What do you want? What do you want? You want my pencil? You want my comb? Just take it all! When I was learning to be a teacher, they taught me how to be a good teacher. Good teachers don't have to punish their pupils. So if I'm a good teacher, you will all study hard. You'll be well-behaved. And then there's no need for punishment. So I'm very disappointed... that I have to do this in my very first week with you. Waan! Bim! Tairn! I want each of the three of you to write a one page essay. The subject is why bullying is bad. What are you doing back here? You stole my comb! I didn't. Yes, you did. Did you find anything in your bag? Yes. Was it pretty? Very pretty. But I can't use it to comb my hair. How dare you speak like that! Do you know who I am? I don't remember you telling me your name. I can do whatever I want here. It's my forest and if I say, you can't come in! If it's your forest, then let's see the papers. What papers? If you own the forest, you must have some papers. Otherwise, it could be my forest! It isn't! It is! You gave it to me. I never did! I bought it. I didn't sell it. I gave you the comb. You gave me the forest. Liar! I'm not the liar. You're the liar! Get out! Don't step foot in my forest again! My home is just over there. You expect me to walk all the way around to go to school? Well? I'm thinking. Are you going to take long? I'm going home! There's this game... Someone hides, and someone tries to find them. Hide and seek! You can hide. I'll try to find you. If I do, I can kill you. But if can't find you, you can come back whenever you want. You're mad! It's my forest. It's my game. I make the rules. Alright. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten... Eleven... Twelve... Thirteen... Fourteen... Fifteen... Sixteen... Seventeen... Eighteen... Nineteen... I'm going now, okay? I'm going now. Did you change your mind? About the cigarette? No thanks. I just wanted a little bit of advice. Of course. Let's take a walk. Nit, What do you know about the girl in my class called Ja. Are the other girls picking on her again? Yes. I tried to stop them. But the kids didn't want to listen. They just saw Ja was different. So can Ja really not speak at all? Is it physical? Or do you think it's a psychological thing? Who knows? Ja is certainly a strange girl. You know nobody's ever met her parents. Who knows if she even has parents? There's just rumours. That her father's a drunk. That they live by the forest. But her father's never been to the school. I know... I should have done something. But the thing is... Almost half the kids in the school are being brought up by their grandparents. Because their parents have gone to work in the city. It's a pretty normal thing for kids to turn up to school covered with bruises. Because their Dad got drunk and beat them. Some suffer abuse from members of their family. Last year we had a thirteen year old who had to quit school because she was pregnant. I'm just their teacher. I do my best. We're being watched. I'd better go. I have homework to mark. This is the village headman, Mr Wittaya. And Waan's father. Yesterday, Waan got home late from school. Did you keep her behind after class? That's right. I had to punish a group of pupils by keeping them after class. I'm very sorry if it caused any worry. Worried? Of course parents are going to worry if their child doesn't come home! My wife went on about it all night. I understand. Why did you feel it necessary to punish them so harshly? I bet it was something to do with the retard girl. The girl you refer to as the 'retard' is called Ja. She's been picked on by a group of girls every day. And one of those girls is your daughter, Waan. You can say whatever you want, but my daughter took no part in anything like that. Waan told me herself. But sir, I chased after the group of girls. I could see that your daughter was one of them. Are you calling my daughter a liar? I'm not calling anyone anything. But I... Is it at all possible... that you might have been mistaken in who you saw? Think carefully. I suppose it's possible. If we all agree it was a mistake, and you're sorry, then that's the end of the matter. Thank you very much, headmaster. May I have a quick word? I heard that you only recently left the monkhood to come and teach here. That's right. This is a very nice village. Everyone gets along well. If there's anything I can do for you, make sure you come and ask. Thank you. Just make sure all the children get home on time today. You don't want to worry their mothers, do you? Class, everyone stand! Thank you, teacher. Don't forget to do your homework. Ja! Please stay behind. Wait a second. You can wait till they've all gone. Then you can go. You understand everything I say, don't you? Do you know why it is that you can't speak? Have you been to see a doctor? Were you able to speak before? Or has it always been like this? Or perhaps you were ill at some time, and you lost your voice? "I can't remember." So why do you think it is that you can't speak? "It's my karma." Your first week is over. How was it? Some of it was okay. You seem like a bit of a troublemaker. You mean the thing with the village headman? Oh yes. You brought him to the school in the very first week of term. That's impressive! I really didn't mean to cause a situation. I was just trying to do the right thing. That's all. Don't worry about it. It's good to shake things up a bit. It's way too quiet here. Have you taught here long? Way too long. Every year... I tell myself it's going to be my last term. But there never seems to be anyone to replace me. There isn't exactly a long queue to come and teach here. After you've been here a while... you learn how to... How do I put it? You learn to limit just how much you care about the kids. If you start to care too much about them, you're bound to get hurt. It's just my advice. Life here... outside... You'll find it's not what you're used to. I'd better turn in. I'd better warn you... Weekends here are really quiet... very dull... And pretty lonely. Miss Nittaya. I just wanted to give you some advice. Maybe you shouldn't get too close to him. I wouldn't want to see you disappointed. I have a feeling he's not going to be around for too long. We're really going to go in there? No-one dares to go in there. But that's good for us. There'll be tons of animals. And big ones. We'll make loads of money. Let's go. I know the way. But why here? This place scares the shit out of me! No way. This is the best place. It's your fault we've got to come here! It was your idea to gamble all our wages. I've never even liked football. Let's get a move on! Let's just get it done, then we'll have some money to take home. Let's go. Boy, I've come back to see you. Go! Go! But you said if I played hide-and-seek with you I could come back whenever I wanted. Go! Go! Go! But you said... Dear Lord, please help me to do the things you sent me here to do. Help me to succeed in my tasks. And help me to be a good teacher. So I can improve the lives of the children. Amen. It's that new teacher from Bangkok. Good evening. Come on over here! Come over here! Good evening. So you're the new teacher. That's right. Where are you headed? I'm just on my way back to the school. No need to rush home! You need a drink. Come and join us! It's okay, thanks. Don't worry about me. I have work to get on with at school. You're too good to drink with the local hicks? Not at all. Actually I don't drink. Teacher... What about that teacher Nittaya, eh? That pale skin! She's a beauty! All those curves! Have you been there yet? Excuse me. What's up with your friend? They say I'm sick. May I ask you a question, teacher? Do you believe in ghosts? Ghosts? I have never seen one. There's good in the world - and there's evil. But if you want to know what I think about ghosts... I don't believe in them. Teacher... You should go home! Believe me! This place is haunted. Can I help? Nit. I found this poster over there in the corner. I hope you don't mind me putting it up on the wall. Do whatever you want. It's your classroom now. I think... we're in for a rainstorm. It's a good thing. It'll cool things down. Boy! Boy! Are you here? Boy! Are you there? You said I could come and see you. Boy! Are you there? Please help me... to overcome the obstacles. And Lord help me to... take the right path. Find yourself a partner. Then take a balloon. Don't burst it! If you burst it, you won't get another. Don't blow them up too big! Don't you have a partner? Never mind. I'll be your partner. You're about to die. Do you know that? This is your last minute of life. Are you scared? Do you want to die? After you're dead... where do you go? What happens to you? Let's find out. What is it, a cartoon book? Next time read your proper books, okay? So today we learnt about thunder, lightning and electrical storms. They don't come from angels! And they don't come from Thor! They all have a natural scientific explanation. Everyone understand? We understand. Very good. Monitor, release the class. Class, everyone stand! Thank you, teacher. Ja! Your house is this way? I'll take you home. Boy! Where are you? So she can speak! How come you can't speak at school? It was all an act! Come here! She can speak after all. Come here! So speak for us! Speak! Go on! Talk! I want to hear you speak! I want to hear her speak. If you don't want to eat this, say something! Look what she did! It hurts! My daughter had to have five stitches. She was lucky it wasn't much worse. They said this imbecile girl just attacked my daughter with a rock. You know the headman could just call the police. Do you want to be arrested? He has every right. He could make it a police matter. But instead, he has given me the authority to administer appropriate punishment. Do you realise there are many people who say you shouldn't even be at this school. Because you don't belong here. I have tolerated you only because I never thought you would pose a risk to other students. Anyway, I can see you need to be punished. Headmaster! May I say something? I know I haven't been here very long. But I've seen quite clearly that Ja has never shown any signs of violence. She has been continuously teased by other girls. Including Waan. Is it all that surprising... that she tried to defend herself? Ridiculous! Headmaster, do what you need to do! Teacher, thank you for sharing your opinion. You're quite right... when you say you haven't been here long. I know all about this girl! She must be punished! Come here! Once again, I must apologise. I can assure you it will not happen again. Thank you so much for your understanding. Mr. Preecha... I'm sure you must miss you're old job. Think about it! I'm not stupid! I know everything that goes on in this school. What is it? They said I'm bad. I'm not bad! Waan's the bad one. Are you crying? No! What's it like to cry? Don't you know? What's it for? When you're upset, you cry. When life isn't fair, you cry. When you think no-one loves you... you cry. Everyone should have someone who loves them. What's this? That's you. That's me. That's lightning. I found it. So I should get to keep it! Keep it. I'm never going back to school. I heard about everything. Well, you wanted to learn about the real world. Now you have. I told Headmaster Somphong that I'll be leaving at the end of term. I think that'll be good for you. It's what you wanted, isn't it? Yes. So at the end of term, we'll both be free. I'm not sure how you feel... but that night, made me realize that... I need something more than this. I'm not just a teacher. I'm a woman. With my own life. With my own desires. With my own needs. I really hope you find what it is you need. Maybe I already have found what I need. Nit. I need to apologise for what happened that night. I don't know how I let it happen. I came here to help the children. I'm sorry. And I can promise you... it'll never happen again. Boy. Am I pretty? Boy. Have you ever loved anyone? No. What is love? I don't really know. What? Are you stupid or what? Asking dumb questions! In the time you wasted, all the fish have gone! You don't need to be nasty about it! Where do you live? Here. No. I mean your house. I don't have a house. Everyone has a house. Not me! So where do you sleep? Sometimes in a tree. In a cave. Or in the lake. You're crazy! You can't sleep in water. You'd drown for sure! Yes I can. I can't drown, and I can't die. Liar! I'm not a liar! Ja. Ja. Come into the water. Come in the water with me. No. Come with me to the bottom. It's beautiful. No. I'm scared to. If you just hold my hand, we can be together forever. It's huge! It's my forest. It's my mountain. They're my animals. Everything belongs to me. There you go again! It's not easy you know Looking after all this. It's hard work. It's exhausting. People come to harm the forest... and take the animals. I get rid of them. How do you do that? I kill them, and eat them. You're a very strange boy! I know why you want to leave. It's all because of him, isn't it? If it is, then so what? It's like I'm a prisoner here. You live here? It's scary. Are there ghosts? Yes. There's a ghost. Look. A rabbit! You caught it? Yes. It was very fast. But I was faster! Why d'you catch it? You said you were hungry. You're going to kill it? How else can you eat it? That's wrong. Everything has to eat. How can it be wrong? Are you a good person? If you're good, you'll go straight to heaven. What's heaven? If you're a good person, when you die, you go to heaven. There you find everything you ever wanted. Everyone's kind to you. Everyone loves you. But... If you're a bad person, when you die, you go to hell. It's horrible. There are only cruel, nasty people there. I don't believe you. You don't have to believe me! So first, we have to know how many hours in one day. Boy. Did you ever think of leaving the forest? No. Why not? I couldn't. That's not my world. Boy. Don't you ever go to school? No. What about school? School? What for? To know things. Know what things? Thai language. Maths. Science. Who needs it! Everyone needs to learn. - I learn here. - Learn how? From the animals. Don't tell me you talk to them! Not talk. Just listen. Crazy! It's not crazy. Listen! Do you hear them? I'll tell you. This year's there's no rain. There have been lots of poachers. And if there's no rain, there's no food. The animals are having a very hard time. The birds are saying that there's been no rain, so the trees are dry. So fires can start easily. So they're warning their friends to be careful. The crickets are finding higher ground. They're saying, 'Thank you for warning us' You see? It's beautiful. If you stay here, you can see it every day. At first you didn't even let me in your forest. So I changed my mind. What're you doing? Reading my book. What's it about? A B C What's A B C? That's A ANT A ANT A ANT And this one's B - BIRD B BIRD So, what's this one? I don't know. That's C! Don't! What's up? Is it about the book? It's just a stupid book. What d'you need it for, anyway? It's not about the book. I want to go home. I miss school. But you can't go back. Why not? Waan will hurt you. Will you let her? Who cares? I can put up with it. I won't let you go. And how will you stop me? I'll tie your hands and feet and keep you here. Then you're even worse than Waan. You remember you asked me what love is? Love is... when you do something you don't want to. But you do it anyway, because you love someone. If that's what you want... Go! I won't stop you. I'll come back. I won't go for long. No. You won't come back. Ja! You need to come with me! What is it, headmaster? Come with me now! But we're still in class time. Can't it wait till end of school? Come with me now! Headmaster! I know I'm not going to be here much longer... But right now, this is still my classroom. And it's still my job to know what's happening with my pupils. Mr. Preecha. Last night, the headman's daughter was murdered in her bed! Then I'm going too. Why've you stopped? Keep going! Give me the torch! What are you doing? You can't just set fire to the forest. I can. What about Ja? My daughter is dead! Headman, you can't do this! You can't! Ja's in the forest! You can't do this! Let me go! Let me go! Headman! Don't! Don't hurt me! I never hurt you! You hurt other people! It was you who said that she was bad. She deserved to be killed. I'm going home now. Stay with me! I won't hurt anyone! I won't kill anyone! If you don't want me to. Who are you? I don't know. Father... Who is he? Father! Who is he? He's your brother. Before... Life was so good! You liked to go swimming in the lake. Your mother would watch over you. Then one day... She went to pick some wild herbs. When she came back... Your brother was drowned. Some people said that... he died trying to stop you drowning. Your mother... She couldn't take it. Sometimes... I can't bear to look at you. They've come to destroy the forest. I didn't do anything. I didn't kill them. I didn't stop them. I won't ever leave you again. I'll stay with you forever. I did everything wrong. I failed utterly. I didn't help at all. Wake up! It's time. Is this the place?
