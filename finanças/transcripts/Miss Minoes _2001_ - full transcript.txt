What was that? Minoes, what are you up to? It's much too dangerous in the road! It wasn't me. That madman! Come inside, dinner's ready. - I'm coming! Silly mutt! - Look, the cat was obviously pregnant. Tibbe, this is no good. I want hard news and cats aren't news. I'll give you one more chance. I want a news story tomorrow. Real news: a fire, anniversary, whatever. If not, then... ...I'll have to let you go! Sorry... Okay, Tinus, I'm shy. You can't be shy if you work for a newspaper. You have to walk up to anyone. You have to ask the minister, even in the bath... ...what he got up to last night. But I'll do it! I'll find some news. "From our reporter: News is everywhere." The boiler exploded. A storm in a teacup. - Mr. Ellemeet, may I...? Mr Ellemeet... Mr. Ellemeet? - I'm coming. Mr. Ellemeet, I wanted to ask... Hi Tibbe, what's up? - Sjoerd! Have you spoken to Ellemeet? - Nearly. Mr Ellemeet! Killendoorn News. Can I ask you some questions? - Any time! From our own reporter: "Man buys fish." - Hello Tibbe. What? Four sardines, please. - Sure. Anything unusual around here? - No, life goes on. Come on! Here you are. Has he gone? Who? - That dog. Yes, he's gone. Come on down. I daren't, I'm so high up. Don't be scared. I'll help you. Come on. Come down. Sorry, I have to climb a tree when I see a dog. Never mind, no problem. Thanks... "Girl up tree." Why are you afraid of... dogs? Hi Bibi. Can I play on the computer? - Sure. Tibbe! Real typewriter sounds! Just right for a reporter. I can remove it too. What's the difference. I'm getting the sack tomorrow. - Really? Unless I write a good story. You have any good news? I got 8/10 for my essay. - That's good. But it's not news. You see, I'm not brave enough. I don't dare do anything. You have to do that with your tongue. Bibi! You should be in bed, you know that! Sorry, Tibbe. This is really tiresome. Shall I come and dust down sometime? I have an hour tonight. - No, I have to write an article. Auntie Moor. Auntie Moor. Auntie Moor! Are you really Minoes from Emma Avenue? Come here. Don't let anyone see! I'm so glad to see you. Goodness! You stink of humans. Your clothes are awful! Where did you get them? - I borrowed them. You stole them! You do have a tail! Not even a bump. - Not even a bump? What a disgrace! What did they say in Emma Avenue? My sister turned tail. She blames me. Quite so. A human! I wouldn't be human for a thousand canaries! Magic at work? - I don't know. All I know is that I went out as a puss... ...and came back a miss. It must be your fault. You have a house? Girl up tree. At about 8 pm, a dog chased a girl. She climbed to the top of a tall tree in panic. She didn't dare come down... ...so I offered her a hand. It's a story. Bibi? Hello, miss? - Do excuse me. I was on the roof and it smelt lovely. So I climbed in through the window. What a coincidence. We met today, didn't we? The fish has all gone. But I could get you a sandwich... ...a sardine sandwich? - Yes please! Do take a seat. May I ask your name? Minoes, Ms Minoes. Right. I'm... - Mr Tibbe. Indeed... ...but just call me Tibbe. I'd rather call you Mr Tibbe. Why were you on the roof? I was looking for a steady job. On the roof? You work for the newspaper, don't you? I'm a reporter. I write articles, track down stories. But not for long? How did you know? I heard... Who told you? Auntie Moor. And who's Auntie Moor? - The mayor's cat. She heard from Mrs Vicar. - Mrs Vicar? The vicar's cat. Quite so. You really should go. Nice meeting you. It's late. I have to write an article. I thought maybe I could help. I heard some news on the way. News? Such as? Can I stay the night if I tell you? Very well. Okay. Just one night. If it's interesting news. What exactly have you heard? Jakkepoes is having kittens. Right. I can't write about cats. The paper isn't interested. That's a pity... - Yes. You have any other news? No... Mrs Vicar found a pot of gold coins, but that's all. Mrs Vicar? "Puss finds pot of gold." Hello, Vicar. - Tibbe. It's very late. "Reporter finds old gold." Let's open with that story by Sjoerd. It's a good piece, Sjoerd. - Thanks. Sorry I'm late... I had to wait for the pictures. "Millions found in graveyard." Nice headline? Where did you get that? I happened to be nearby. MILLIONS FOUND IN GRAVEYARD Here you are. Two scoops of ice for a scoop! Thanks! - Congratulations Tibbe! I just love news. - Me too! Tomorrow too? - Yes indeed. I'm hot off the press. Ms Minoes? Ms Minoes? Quite so, it's not right. A human on the roof. I thought it was a thief. - A burglar. A burglar wearing a suit? - With or without a suit. She's human and doesn't belong on the roof. What about Father Christmas? That's true. He gets on the roof too. The teacher says so at school. Shut up, Simon, we have a problem. What does she want on our roof at this hour? I don't know much about ladies, only about lady cats! You just make them pregnant! Thank you! - Any time. She's no problem. Let's go home. No! Soon the roof will be teeming with people! We have to set an example. It's me, Minoes. From Emma Avenue. I don't know why I look human either. I purr, I rub noses. I'm a cat inside. She's a cat. I didn't realise. Shut up, Simon! - Sorry I spoke! Let me sniff your paw. Yugh! Human! Well, Mrs Pussy, the Great Miaow Song... Do you know it? Of course. - Go on then. Stop that horrible din! FROM OUR REPORTER... The cat box was full, so I shat on the mat. I'm off. Your stories make me want to do it in my pants. You aren't wearing any! - Shut up, Simon. Okay, I'm off. - Have a safe journey. Bye, girls... Leave me alone again! I have lots to do. Bye, Casanova! Tomcats are all the same. I'd like to go home too. I had a home... ...with a garden. - Stop it, Minoes. People only give you vets, jabs and flea collars. I'd love a house with a stove, Jakkepoes. Oh, Minoes... - As long as they clean the cat box. What's wrong with out in the wild? I don't need a clean box to be happy. - Minoes! Minoes! - He's calling me. Isn't that Tibbe the reporter? - Yes. Don't go there. Stay free. I have an old caravan where you can become a cat again. Ms Minoes! I think I'll go anyway. Weakling! Remember: they drown your kittens! Here I am. Come in. Ms Minoes, I wanted to ask... I thought about it. Would you be my assistant? You can sleep here in exchange for news. I'd love to. What's going on in town? FUEL PRICES RISE STATUE OF BENEFACTOR ELLEMEET MAYOR WEEZEL'S ANNIVERSARY Hello girls! The butcher's cat heard the word from the smith's tomcat. And Van Duyn's cat got the bird. And he knows where it's at. Tinus, that was mine! Hey, Tibbe... How are you? Busy. It's a madhouse. For me too. I'm drawing Jakkepoes... That's nice. - For the contest... Drawing contest? -...run by the Pet Lovers. You don't have time to look? I have so much work... Ms Minoes? What's that? Let go. Let go. Have you gone mad? Men are men and do silly things. They can't help it. He has a secret girlfriend. I saw her. Tibbe is in love. Men in love are a disaster. It'll pass. Love always passes. Very well... Thank you... Good evening. The neighbour said a girl is living with Tibbe. That's nice for him. I gather she's pretty strange. It's none of our business. Apparently she sits on the roof at night! How does she know? Is she up there too? You don't care what goes on upstairs. But I do! I'll talk to him tomorrow. Really! Mrs van Dam... - Hello, Tibbe. Is anything wrong? I did pay the rent, didn't I? - Right on time. Shall I make some coffee? - No thanks. I just came to say I read your articles every week. Can I sniff around? Is this the closet? - All my old rubbish... She scratched you! - It's not too bad. I wanted to tell you. This is my secretary, Ms Minoes. Mrs van Dam is my landlady and Bibi's mother. It's very nice... to meet you. Bye. - Bye... You can never go upstairs again, Bibi! You hear that? Okay, you have a gift of communicating with cats. Fine. You're a medium, okay... But you're a person, not a cat. You should spend more in the street, not on the roof. I was out last night! - I mean during the day. You could go shopping! But I'll wait until after dark. The shops are shut then. Now! We need some bread. I'm scared. - The baker is close to the fish-man. We need fish too. Maybe I can learn. Once I'm out there. You'll have to adjust, otherwise you can't stay here. And a sliced brown loaf. Don't go nuzzling the fish-man. Down, Tarzan! He won't do anything. Come on, Tarzan... You came for your order? How much fish does this buy? Minoes, up here on the roof. Simon! I have fantastic news for the paper. Let's rub noses first. Mr Ellemeet is to be chairman of the Pet Lovers. And the Titanic has sunk: 2000 dead! You must have been to a history lesson. I didn't tell you. Don't quote me. Okay, kids: climb! Bibi, up you go. Very good. Bibi! Watch out. What happened? Show me. Does it hurt? That's crazy. What an awful feeling. I think I feel guilty. Guilty? What's that? Max, heel! Here it comes. Ms Minoes? Sorry to interrupt, but... ...my wife and I have to report... ...that your secretary is up a tree. This is most displeasing, Ms Minoes. It won't do. I can't help it. When I see a dog... Please help me. It's not just climbing trees. I was worried. Aren't I your assistant any more? I have news. Mr Ellemeet is to be chairman of the Pet Lovers. That's more like it. Come on. If you behave more like a lady, you can stay my assistant. No more playing a cat on the roof. Yes, but... - No, no... I must do one important thing. That's very good. Careful... Don't be afraid or look down. Pull up. You're a natural! Isn't it lovely? Look, there's the school. Tinus, what's up? Jakkepoes has had kittens! How do you know? - Tinus says so. He's the father! Can you talk to cats? I was one myself. But... - I don't understand either... I remember something about a barrel... Now I'm a cat in the wrong body. Strange... See? Let me try. Congratulations. They're so tiny. But they're pretty. The little one is just like Tinus. I nearly forgot. Go and see Aunt Moor. She's waiting for you. I don't have time. Minoes. She has news of your sister. What does she say? Just gossip. For you, because we're friends now. That's a kiss. You didn't know? Yes, but we always rub noses. Goodnight. Hey, Ms Minoes. Jakkepoes has had four kittens. - Great. Goodnight Mr Tibbe. Goodnight Ms Minoes. "A great car for a great reporter," Mrs Bongers said. All thanks to you. I have something for you. Take them. For at the reception. So you won't hurt if you scratch anyone. Reception? I thought this was for the drawing contest? But afterwards there's a reception. I'm not going. Ms Minoes... It would be good for you. And for me too. We're both shy and have to learn. I think the fish-man will be there. Hurry up, Tibbe. Congratulations. I didn't expect it. I want to thank the Pet Lovers for this prize. Special thanks for inspiration to Ms Minoes. Congratulations, Bibi van Dam. Nice to see you, Tibbe. This is my secretary. - Secretary? Is that what they call it? Yes. Ms Minoes. - I think we met. Didn't we? In a tree? We have to get on. - See you later. Can I have some? - Later... It's a great honour to announce... ...the benefactor of our town, Mr Ellemeet. Is that the mayor? - No, that's Mr Ellemeet. He owns the factory and does good. - What good? He gives money to good causes. The new chairman of the Pet Lovers, Mr Ellemeet. This is the official chairman's badge. May I? - Certainly! There's only one of these... Thanks, Harry. I accept this post... ...with great pride and as the new chairman... Some people can't wait. Let's celebrate with a snack and a sip. Tibbe, have you lost anything? - No, it's all right. I'll help you look. - No, thanks. It's nice to talk to you privately. I've been thinking, Mr Mayor. I was thinking of a swimming pool. A swimming pool. You mean the factory extension... A pool... A town like Killendoorn can always use a pool. How big is your back garden? My back garden... I don't know... I shall advise the council to approve your expansion. Why don't we talk about it later? Drop by the factory. Take a look. That's a good idea. You know my wife? - Yes... Ms Minoes... Ms Minoes.. Ms Minoes? Ms Minoes.... Where were you? I have news. - I don't care. You have to stop it. All this catty behaviour. Feline, not catty. - Okay, feline. You'll get me in trouble. - I'm trying, but I can't. It's confusing being two creatures at once. Half human, half cat. It's pretty confusing being human sometimes. Really? - Yes. You know what it is? I sometimes have my doubts. I wish I were a cat. Tail raised under the laburnum... Hunting baby starlings in the garden... Sometimes I even yearn for my cat box. But being a girl has its bright side. Quite so. Herring... What was the news? The deodorant factory is expanding. - Thanks. Delicious. Just look at me! Look how high! Look at me climbing! Mummy's going for a drink. Don't wreck the place while I'm away. Get lost, filthy cat! Ah, Tibbe... - Mr Ellemeet. Come in... A nice surprise. How's the paper? - Fine, thanks. We're expecting guests any minute... Carry on. It's Tibbe from the paper. A glass of wine? I have a great Bourgogne. No thanks. I have to write. Take a seat. What I wanted to ask... What are the expansions plans for the factory? The plans are not final. The council has to meet. Not right now. But if it goes ahead... ...you'll be the first to know. Very clever of you to know it already. How come? I said it hurts! Let go. I want to make sure nothing's broken. It looks nasty... Get off me! Don't fuss. I don't want a basket or a jab. I'd rather die. People are all scum! Surely this is news. Jakkepoes beaten up by Pet Lovers chairman. She can hardly walk. It's terrible, of course. But I can imagine he was mad to find a cat on his buffet. I can imagine that you'd chase the cat away... I met him. Ellemeet isn't a bad type... It's no good for the paper. Cats aren't news. Human! Auntie Moor. Auntie Moor. Minoes, there you are at last. Still no progress, no tail? Just that awful suit. I spoke to your sister. She isn't angry any more. You can come back... ...as a cat. Yes, but how... -Your sister has an idea. She's waiting in Emma Avenue. Go quickly. What are you waiting for? That's enough fuss. Well? I don't know if I want... I have my doubts. I can't walk out on the cat press service. I'm just passing on your sister's message. She said to hurry. I don't know. It's all so confusing. Auntie! Minoes! - Mrs Vicar? Praise the Lord I found you. The fish stall has been knocked over. Harry! Don't worry, Ms Minoes. Harry is hurt but not dead. Do you know what happened, Tibbe? The stall was on its side and Harry unconscious. That's all. I know who did it. Mrs Vicar saw it. Guess who.... Ellemeet? Yes, and Ellemeet robbed the bank and killed hundred of people... Tinus and Simon saw it. Saw what? What's this? You come over the roof? - Ellemeet beat up Jakkepoes... ...then knocked over the fish stall and drove off. What a stinker. - Yes... The witnesses are Simon, Tinus and Mrs Vicar. Cats aren't witnesses. - Oh no? I can't write: "Several cats said Mr Ellemeet knocked over the fish stall." That isn't evidence. - Tibbe, you're a coward! All the news the cat press service gave you, was any of it untrue? No, it wasn't. Ellemeet is a benefactor. Why would he hit and run? He wants to stay clean. Understand? Or the council would reject his plans. He doesn't want that. - But... I don't want to be your assistant! You're a coward! Do you think so too? Sorry, Tibbe. You're a real wimp! Hey Tibbe. - Hello Harry. How are you? I was pretty shaken up, but I'm better now. Thanks. There was nothing serious. What happened? - No idea. A bang and I passed out. Someone hit my stall, but I didn't hear it coming. There's a rumour that Ellemeet did it. - Ellemeet? He's one of my best customers! He would help, not drive off. Gossip like that makes me angry. - Yes, it's gossip. Did you see anything? - Did you? We didn't see anything. The very idea... Ms Minoes. I'm on strike, and so is the cat press service! I realise you're disappointed, but I'm working on it. I'm doing my best, but no one believes me. Ellemeet is a hero and I'm a gossip. There is no proof. No one saw it. The fish stall is clean and Ellemeet's car looks fine. He wasn't in his own car. He was in the big night truck. The big night truck? Lovely, eh? The recipe is secret. But I can assure you that the combination... ...of delicious scents, gentle oils and powerful herbs... ...makes Deo's deodorant so special. Pure and natural. Good for man and beast. Got it? Let's go outside! A good factory needs space... ...space to grow. Wait. It wasn't on. What's the matter? Ah, Mr Mayor. Come with me and we'll have a walk, Moor. Mayor van Weezel. What a surprise. How are you? Can you manage, Mrs Ellemeet? - Great! Come this way. Occupy yourself! The old caravan will be demolished. - Of course. The press... Excuse me. I'm coming. You can't stay here alone. Come on. Looking for something, Tibbe? With the expansion plans, I am fascinated with developments here. As I said, you'll be the first to know. I'm working on a promotional film. I could send you a copy. No, thanks. I thought you had a small truck? I did, but not any more. I don't like this investigative reporting. I hope that is clear. You're not losing any time. You've started digging before the referendum. Tibbe, Pia Bongers is a good friend of mine and my wife. A fine career can be ruined in no time. I hope that is clear. Mr Ellemeet... As Pet Lovers chairman, I'm sure you can help. Any time... Auntie Moor... Something terrible has happened. Don't complain. Be glad we're rid of them. But you're chairman of the Pet Lovers! But I don't run a cats' home! Minoes! Problems? I'm glad to see you. We have to find them. Tennis is like life: give and take. The ball comes and goes. One serves, the other returns. We all understand? Bibi too? Great. Now you can try. Minoes, what's up? Ellemeet has Jakkepoes's kittens! Thank goodness, there you are. I'll help you. Dear Lord, do something! It'll be all right. I won't be long, wait there. We'll never find them. Where? Calm down, don't panic. That's enough! Down! Sit! Stop! I've got them. Incredible. Incredible... What about Jakkepoes? Where is she? She didn't want to come with us. You know her. But I can't leave them in the caravan. It's terrible. Who'd do that? The chairman of the Pet Lovers! Honorary citizen of Killendoorn. The town benefactor. Minoes, coffee. Bibi, chewing gum. Will you write an article? No, Ms Minoes. I'll write THE article. Tibbe's writing! At last! ELLEMEET, BENEFACTOR OR BUM? Surprise! Look... "Ellemeet, benefactor or bum?" Great, Tibbe! Jakkepoes? Mr Tibbe, looks who's here. Even Jakkepoes is proud of you. "Ellemeet, benefactor or bum?" What rubbish! Tibbe's house here? Tibbe, it's for you. This is Tibbe! Listen. Ellemeet is angry, he's furious. He's quite right to be. I trusted you but this is libel. It's the truth. Ellemeet is evil. - Where's your proof? Quite so, Tibbe. You can make up by writing that Ellemeet is a blessing to Killendoorn. That you're sorry... ...you made a mistake and the Deo factory smells great. That we can't do without deodorant, everyone would stink. Agreed. - No. Ellemeet does evil things. He's dangerous. Tibbe... You were doing so well. We can't do without his ads. Be sensible. I won't do it. Right... Fine... I have nothing more to say. You can go! Tibbe de Vries. Car keys, please. Sacked... Sorry I have to say it... ...but it was just gossip. Where did you get it? Thanks! Harry, you'll never guess what happened. I suppose it figures. First I was saved by the cats. Now I've been sacked, thanks to the cats. But I did what I had to. - It isn't over yet. Ellemeet can't get away with it. We're having a Miaow-in to discuss plans tonight. A Miaow-in? What time. It's only for cats. - That's discrimination! Sorry. Bibi... I'm glad you come here again. I hadn't forgotten you. But Minoes and the cat press service... ...it was secret at first. I understand. Listen, Tibbe. I talked to my husband. He agrees. This can't go on. What d'you mean? - I mean... This place is crawling with cats. Four kittens, a stray, that girl and hundreds of cats on the roof. What is my daughter doing here? Bibi. You should be in bed! You can make a fool of Mr Ellemeet, but not me! You have to be out of here in a week! I'll rent the room to someone reliable! Goodnight! Minoes! It'll be all right. We have a plan. Onions too, Mr Ellemeet? - Please Harry. Call it 20, Harry. - Thank you! You will vote for me next week, won't you? You can count on me, Mr Ellemeet. Even the cats are voting for you. You're a real pet lover. Here's the fish. - Keep the change, Harry. Mr Ellemeet, we'll vote for you too. We love cats. Some nice steak... Thank you. Here you are. Here's your Bourgogne. - Thank you. Is everything in order, Mr Ellemeet? Yes, Bob. Thanks for your support. Cross my claws... Give up, coward! Did I look convincing? A lovely meal, darling. That's such an nasty habit. I'm so glad you're not mad at me any more. I hope you behave from now on. Animals have feelings. - You're right. Darling, never mind! My roses! They're destroying my roses! - Darling! Have they gone or not?! Darling, really. What are you doing? No, don't! Scum! What are you doing here? Get out of my garden! Brat! Look at this rectification. They didn't have any bigger letters. The factory will expand and we'll never find out what he was up to. Ms Minoes... If you wanted to hide a truck, where would you do it? As cat or human? Never mind. You look lovely. Tonight's the referendum. Yes, I know. I'm not going. I'm glad I don't have to write any more. Killendoorn hates me. I'm going and I'd like you to come too. She's not coming. It's all for nothing. She daren't! Shut up, Joop. Women can do more than you think. Yes, Mrs Vicar. You certainly can, darling! Tinus, you're a father! - That's true. So what? Tomcats have a one-track mind! - Indeed! There she is! There's Minoes. Come on, you have to dare. Remember? First the video and then we have half an hour... There's the reporter with his secretary. He doesn't work for the paper any more. Because of that disgraceful piece about Mr Ellemeet. With those ridiculous accusations. - Dear friends and townspeople. What a lot of people... As you know, only you can make the factory expansion possible. To make everything clear... ...my wife and I have made a film we'd like to show you. Is that all right, Mr Mayor? - Of course. Great. Lovely...The recipe is secret. But I can assure you that the combination... ...of delicious scents, gentle oils and powerful herbs... ...makes Deo's deodorant so special. Pure and natural. Good for man and.... Hey, that's Mrs Vicar. Go and look at that thing. What are you going? - Darling, nothing... There's Tinus! People, this is trick photography. Someone is trying to smear me. What are you doing here? He hit my child! A disgrace! I thought Mr Ellemeet loved pets! Poor Mrs Vicar! Interval... It's time for a break. No! See? I was right! There is probably more evidence. Let's go to the Deo factory! - Right now. Minoes, here... Auntie Moor, I did it! Great, eh?! - Just in time. It has to happen tonight. - Tonight... This is your only chance. Your sister can make you a cat. I can't do it... My boss Tibbe needs me. Fiddlesticks! He can do it all without you. To the factory! I don't want to go to Chile! You don't listen. I have my life here. You just don't understand, woman! Maybe you don't care, but I have my own life. What are they up to? Get out of here! What are you doing on my land? What's this? - A truck... A truck with a dent. - Harry? You'd lost one! You know what you are? Ungrateful hounds! Everything I have done... ...was to your benefit and glory. Just for you! Killendoorn only flourishes thanks to me! I don't want thanks... ...just a little respect. People of Killendoorn. This man tried to bribe me... ...with a swimming pool! I know the perfect place for a pool. One, two, three! Auntie Moor... What should I do? Eat a bullfinch, feathers and all. - A bullfinch? Listen! Bullfinches eat herbs that cure illness. Yours too. Come on, Minoes. There's one in Emma Avenue. Hurry or we'll miss it. Well done Tibbe. But you didn't have any evidence. And you can't publish without evidence. I hope you do it differently next time. Next time? - You will stay? Please. - How did you find out about the barrels? Even Ellemeet's staff didn't know he used dangerous hormones. I have my sources. - Your secretary again? Where is she? Up a tree? Minoes! - Tibbe, I want to say... ...you don't have to leave. - Thanks. We've thought about it... Ms Minoes! Where should we go? Which number? A yellow laburnum in the garden... Is this a laburnum? Tibbe, come on! Minoes? Oh no... we're too late! - Shit! Minoes, let go! - Don't! It's natural. Cats eat birds. - Nasty nature! There's ice cream in the fridge. I'm sorry. - That's the limit! I can't help it. Another? Sure! The garden's full of rare bullfinches! You know what you are!? A person! They're all the same. They eat chicken, but we mustn't catch birds! It's not fair. - So why do it? I don't know. I must have changed. I imagined that the bird was scared and hurt. Strange, eh? You know what? I have my job back and my home... ...but I don't care. Without Minoes... I has so much to ask her. Did I ever thank her? I really liked her. The way she could climb trees. Purr... She was so sweet when she purred. - She was. And rubbed noses. She was a cat, but I didn't see it. I'd like to turn back the clock. She can keep all her feline habits. All of them? - Minoes! Of course. You can purr and scratch and nuzzle. I don't need to scratch, but a nice nuzzle... Go ahead! I'm so glad you're back. How does it go, rubbing noses? Is that right? - Very good! I can do it! Resync BluRay by m450ud
