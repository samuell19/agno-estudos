You don't look like a watch maker. - What do watch makers look like? - I don't know, old, beard, Belgium or France, you know. - Oh yeah, that's the guy that owns the store, he looks a little bit like that he's the real miracle worker, I'm just the bit imposter. - Can you call me when it's ready please? - Dr. Anna Nolmar, you're a doctor? - I'm a cognitive therapist.

From Portland with large breasts and long legs. And I'm Bobby. - Well Bobby is there something special you'd like to talk about? - Tell me about the one night we spent together last year. - When you locked me in the bank vault? - Are you wet? - Just thinking about it. - Good. - It was closing time when you came to my window. - A man who witnessed the blaze from a diner across the street ran into the building before fire and police rescue teams could arrive. He braved intense flames and toxic smoke in order to rescue a woman and her infant trapped in the raging inferno. - He runs into this building and I mean there's like flames coming out of it and people running all over the place and this guy, I mean he's just like a regular guy and he's just a watch maker or something. I couldn't believe it. - In a time when our heroes seem to be confined... - Yes what is it? - Hello sir, I'm sorry to disturb you. We have a situation here, a very weird situation. Well do you remember Eddy Kay? - Bluebird Eddy Kay? - The same. - Well what about Eddy Kay? - Well I think I just saw him on TV. - When, where? - Here in LA. - Eddy Kay is... - I know he's supposed to be dead. - You mean he's alive? What are you gonna do about it? - I think we must find out and if he is we must deal with him quietly. - Hey guys, how ya doing? Sound like a dirty word. Tell you one thing if we stuffy old father's don't start stuffing some sense into our kids they're gonna grow up thinking with their hips instead of their heads. Good morning Mrs. MacDonald. - Hi Eddy. - You look nice today. - Well thank you very much. - Good morning Al. - Morning. - Colonel, that is Eddy Kay. I'll be damned. - Follow him. Bring everybody in. Don't want to take any chances with this. I want you to take a crack at him tonight, make it look like a robbery. Something's going on. - Somebody call the police. - Lose the sandwich. - Hey lose the attitude okay? It's not some big time homicide case, it's a nothing piece of shit burglary detail. - Social security number - 527195251. - And your telephone number. - I don't have a telephone. - Mr. Kay? - Yes sir. - Detective Sanchez. Are you alright? - Ya I'm fine but it was. - What seems to be the problem? - I don't wanna try and tell anybody how to do their job or anything alright, it's just that these guys are insisting on writing this up as a robbery, I'm telling ya this guy was trying to kill me. - Well Mr. Kay you should know that there's been several burglaries in the neighborhood in the last three months so they probably think it's the same man. - I don't think this was a burglary, I mean this guy was not a burglar you know, he didn't take anything. There's nothing missing, I don't even have anything to take. I was lying asleep in bed, I open my eyes and there's this guy just coming at me with a knife. - Mr. Kay, Mr. Kay, now who would have good enough reason to want to see you dead? Someone that you got mad recently? Someone who had a grudge against you? Someone you owed money to? - I don't owe anybody money I just, I'm a nice guy. - Mr. Kay what did the man look like? - I don't know it was. He looked like a psycho. He looked like a killer, I'm telling you this guy was trying to kill me. - Then how come he didn't? - I don't know. - Good morning Eddy. - Morning. - Oh honey could you help me with this pot? I just need to put it in right here, I've got the earth all ready for it. Just set it right in here, okay? Aw thank you. Aw that's just great. - There you go. - Oh thank you that's great. How you feeling? Eddy what's the matter? Are you alright? Eddy? - Yeah, I'm alright. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Is there anything I can do for you? - No, I'm alright, sorry I'm alright. - Oh sure Eddy. - Eddy, oh Eddy. Do it, do it. - Move asshole! - No. This has to look like an accident. - Well I'll be damned. - The living dead. The package is ready. - I'll send the messenger. - Let's go. The delivery will be on time. Lock four, repeat lock four. - Alpha. - Alpha, repeat Alpha. - Lock three, repeat lock three. Lock two, repeat lock two. Lock one. - Bravo. - Bravo, repeat, bravo. - Yeah baby! - Somebody call an ambulance. - Is he alright? - Did we kill him? - I don't know. - Nah I think he's dead! The license number on that car? - That guy just hit him and... - Yeah! - I couldn't see anything. - Oh he's moving, he's moving. - He's moving. - Call an ambulance hurry! - You sure are lucky mister. - Get some help! - No go, repeat no go. - Good evening Eddy. - Do it. - This has gotta stop. - Yes? - Doctor Nolmar? - Yes? - Hi this is Eddy Kay. - Oh Mr. Kay is my watch ready? - No, the watch isn't fixed yet, that's why I was calling I was hoping I could drop by the office and, your office, and give you a replacement watch that you can use in the meanwhile. - Well I wouldn't want to put you to any trouble. - No, no, no it would be no trouble at all for me, really, I'd really like to do it. - Well if you really want to I guess you could come by tonight after my last session. - Okay. - Do you have the address? - Yes, yes. - A bit after eight. - Alright I'll see you then thank you. - Don't be afraid, come to me Eddy. - All life is it's... - Hello. - Hi. - You really didn't have to you know. - That's okay, didn't want it on my conscious that you were walking around with some electronic junk. - Thank you for bringing this over, I appreciate good service. - Can I ask you a question? I've been having these, I don't even know what you call them, like nightmares during the day. They're real like memories but not memories of anything that ever really happened to me. Do you know anything about that, is that something that... - Now you see I have to leave soon, maybe you'd like to schedule a session? - No, I don't think so. Ya know, it was just a question. - Come in, come in. - I see images and some of them are really violent and bloody. Just really disgusting and others of women. Just like pornography and I'm not a violent person. I don't know where... - Maybe a repressed memory is trying to come out. - No, I've got a really good memory, I've always prided myself on that. I can remember like the smallest details of my childhood, my friends, their names. I used to have a friend named Kevin Richards. I used to call him Kevvy, we used to get into trouble together and play sports. I had a really normal childhood. - Do you have any history of alcohol or drug abuse? - Yeah, I started drinking and I got into drugs, I took a lot of drugs. - How did you stop? - I woke up in a garbage dump one morning, I was sick and my clothes had been really badly burned and my body had been burned and I don't even know how I got there. I knew then that I had to make a change, I kind of drifted and I ended up on the west coast and I thought, I was feeling good, I started feeling really good about myself. - When did you last get a checkup? - A what? - A medical examination. - I've never even been sick. - Well I think you should get a thorough checkup and a brain scan, a pet. - Really? You think there may be something physically wrong with me? - No but you see sometimes memory neurons are destroyed by alcohol or drug abuse or even cerebral tumors, my uncle is a neuro psychiatrist so I can easily make you an appointment if you want. - Thank you very much for your time. - That's okay. - Oh gee, I forgot to pay you. - Well listen let's barter, you get this session for fixing my watch, deal? - Deal. Is that your father? - Yes, we shared the office. - I thought that you said that... - he died over a year ago but I can't bring myself to remove his name. It's a little morbid, I know. Good night Mr. Kay. - Thank you, I feel better. Doctor Nolmar? - Hi Eddy. - I don't know you. - Come on Eddy, you now me well. Why don't we go somewhere and talk. - Talk about what? - Whatever, the past, or the Duke. - I don't know any Duke. - We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality... - stay back. - Cut him off. - Hey, he's over there. - Cover me! - Help, help! Let me in please, please! - What is going on? - Go, 90, go, go, drive, go, drive, drive, go, go. Oh my god, they tried to kill me, they were trying to kill me! Didn't you see them? - See who? I don't know what you're talking about. - No, no, no, no, don't stop, don't stop. Didn't you see them? - Eddy now will you please calm down? There's nobody following us. - I can't believe this. I can't believe this. I can't believe you didn't see 'em. Didn't you see 'em? - See who? I didn't see anyone. - In the parking structure, you didn't see 'em? - Why don't you let me take you to the police? - I've been to the police. They don't believe me. - So what do you want to do? - I don't know, I don't know. - Listen Eddy you're so confused and upset at the moment, I think that we should go to the hospital and run those tests I was telling you about, now. - The hospital, why? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Am I alright? - You're fine though there are some irregularities showing up in the hippocampus. - My what? - Your hippocampus, it's a small bundle of neurons straddling the middle of the lower brain lobes. - What's the matter with my hip, hip, whatever? - It's difficult to explain but what the test seems to show is... - Anna. - I didn't know you spoke Hungarian. - Hungarian, I don't. - Well you just did. - Eddy. Eddy what happened? What? - Yes? - Bad news sir, he's in the hospital. - Hospital? Christ who's got him? - Psychiatric ward. - Psychiatric? Is he talking? - Well I don't know how much he remembers but certainly he doesn't remember anything before the deprogramming and you know if he'd wanted to he could have caused us trouble years ago. - So he's not posing an immediate threat? - Yes but on the other hand to be on the safe side perhaps we should call Sunday off and find... - we can't call Sunday off, there's too much at stake. Forget about doing this quietly, there isn't enough time, go in big and take Kay out and finish the job. - Sir I don't think that'd be prudent. - If physically nothing’s wrong with me then why do I feel so different. My body just feels so different. It's like I know how to do things that I don't know how to do. Somebody else is living in my body. - Have you ever undergone treatment in a mental institution Eddy? - No, I've never even been in a hospital, never even been sick that's why this whole thing is just so... - Are you sure? - Yes I'm sure. - Come to me, come to me Eddy. Come to me Eddy, come to me Eddy. - Eddy, Eddy what do you see, tell me. - A building, lang, lang mental institution. - Lang, I've never heard of it. I'll check that out tomorrow, they should have your medical records. - I've never been there, I've never been there. - Listen you should try and get some sleep. - No, no, no, can't you stay? Just a little while? - You really should sleep Eddy. - Please, please. - Let me give you a sedative. - No, no, I don't want a sedative. Please I just don't want to be alone. - Lieutenant Kirsten? - I don't think so, the only police personnel on the floor is officer Gilbert on night duty. I could call and check. - That's okay, he was supposed to meet us here, we'll just sit and wait. - Okay. - How you doing sir? - D five psychiatric. - It's okay. - What was that? - Hey, what the? - Hey what the? Hey don't shoot! - What is it? - They're here with guns. - Come on, come on. - Damn we're out of time, come on let's go. - Come on, let's go, come on! - Will you please stop the car, I want to get out, please? - How'd they know where I was? You're the only one that knew I was at the hospital, and the garage, you're the only one that knew I was coming to see you, you're one of them. - Why are you accusing me? I've only tried to help you. - Yeah, by giving me a sedative? If I would have taken that I'd be dead. - You're mad. Listen I don't know what your game is but I don't want to be involved okay? - You are involved. You just do what I say, exactly what I say, you understand me? Stay here. Stay. - Robbery homicide. Ya, ya, hang on a minute, hey Sanchez. Line one for you. - I'll take it over here. Sanchez. - Eddy Kay remember me? Do you know what happened? Did you hear what happened? They're trying to kill me don't you believe that? - Is Dr. Nolmar with you? - Yeah she's here. If anything happens to me, she gets hurt. - Ed or whatever your name is, you are in serious trouble and you better get over here as soon as you can. - What are you talking about? - Now you're not Eddy Kay so cut the bullshit. - What? - You listen to me, now Eddy Kay social security number 527195251, born Canton, Ohio died did you hear me? Died in Vietnam in 1972. - I'm not Eddy Kay. - What did he say? What did he say? - He said I'm not Eddy Kay. - Get off me, Eddy get off me! Let me go, please let me go! Let me go! - Get in, get in! If you try anything in the hotel, anything, I'll kill you, do you understand? - Eddy please, you need medicine. Let me go and fetch you some medicine Eddy, you could have a stroke. Just a few grains of Phenelzine or Aniline might calm you down. You don't even know who you are Eddy. - I know who I am. Somebody is trying to make me think I don't know who I am. - Hello? - Hello, Mrs. Richards, Mrs. Richards of 852 Elm Street? - Yes? - It's so good to hear your voice. - Well honey it's good to hear yours too. Who is this? - Mrs. Richards this is Eddy Kay. - Who? - Your neighbor, Kevin's friend, Eddy Kay. - Is this some kind of a prank? Eddy's dead, he was killed in Vietnam, if this some kind of a prank it's not funny. - No, it's not a prank. - Then who is this? - I didn't die. I didn't die, Mrs. Richards please. Mrs. Richards please. Mrs. Richards please, Mrs. Richards. - What have you done? It is sacrilege and you should let him rest in peace. Are you listening to me? You'll go to hell for laughing at the dead. - No, no. I'm sorry, I'm in big trouble. I don't even know what I've done, I'm sorry, help me. - May I help you sir? - Phillips. Mr. Phillips. - Yeah? - Colonel Taylor. - My, my I didn't expect to see you. - I assume you received your instructions. - My instructions yes, verbal. Nobody wanted to put anything down on paper. I'm supposed to give you full computer trace access and taps on police lines on the basis of a verbal? Colonel let me tell you something. I don't want to have anything to do with it. It's guys like me that get shafted, not you, not the guys giving orders. I'd just as soon be fired now as wind up in Louiston on contempt. - Mr. Phillips, I appreciate your predicament but at the risk of sounding cliché. Let me tell you this isn't about getting fired. This is about life expectancy. - Are you threatening me colonel? - I see you have an isolator shall we? And I'll need some coffee. Have you ever heard about the original blue bird program? - I've seen the name in the files, it's restricted access. We're talking 1970's right? - Yeah, well you see the agency was having problems within house operations. Morale and discipline were extremely low, we needed a new kind of operative. More reliable, more immediate, less questioning, less moral, we needed fucking samurai warriors, people to get the job done. So we started doing behavior modification experiments using young subjects, 18, 19. 13 of the original subjects died in training. Seven became exceptional operatives, six are still active. - And the seventh? - Eddy Kay, probably the best subject unfortunately higher scores than anything. Technology, languages, hand to hand, everything. - So? He quit on you, he's writing a book, what? - Phillips, Eddy Kay was involved in an elimination, we thought he'd been killed during the elimination. Not so and now he is threatening a major operation and I got 48 hours to bring him in. We are not talking about a little scandal here. We are talking about political systems. Which is why it has to be verbal and why you have to cooperate. - Come in six, come in six your position? - Hi honey. - Come in three, come in three. - This is three, negative. - Eddy- what are you going to do? - What do you do when you don't know what to do? - You have to talk to yourself. You have to act against your inclination to act instinctively. Irrationally, violently. You have to hang onto a belief system. - You went to school for six or seven years to dish out that crap? - Aren't you hungry? You know you can think better on a full stomach. Maybe we could find a coffee shop nearby. - Alright, I'll get us something to eat. - Here's some money, you can take the credit card as well. - Take off your sweater and your stockings. - What? - Take off your sweater and your stockings. - Why? - Come on. Don't move, no matter what you do, don't move. You slip up just a little bit, it'll cut you to ribbons. - Where did you learn this little trick? In watch makers school? And I was feeling sorry for you. - One in position, no contact. - Candy coming up. - Thank you. - We got her car, it's all just a matter of time now. - Great, what about LAPD phone system? - Yeah we're in. You want a coffee? - Yeah. - Coffee please, two. - Field communications? - Yeah we're established, honey slide over for a second. You can run it from here. Dr. Anna Nolmar, psychologist born Budapest Hungary. - The foods here, come and get it. - Oh very funny, do you mind disarming this thing please. Oh you fuck! You fuck! - No, come here, come here, calm down. Calm down, calm down, just calm down, I had to make sure that you wouldn't leave, okay just stick with me through the night and I'll let you go in the morning, I promise. - Is that the best you could do? - Yeah, I hope you're not on a diet. - Robbery, homicides, Sanchez. - Sanchez, it's Eddy Kay. I've got Dr. Nolmar but I'm ready to release her to you personally, only to you, I don't want any other cop or any other detective involved in this. If I see another cop it's a no show, is that understood? - Understood. - Mya theater on sixth and hill street, got it? - Got it, Mya theater. - Can you be there in 20 minutes? - Got it. - Alone. - Now listen Eddy hold on... - it's done. - Thank you. - I'm sorry I have to take your car. I'll send you a check or something. - Okay -. Eddy? - Yeah? - Nothing. Thank you. - Here's our top story of the hour, a powerful explosion rocked the 800 block of Olympic boulevard earlier this morning. Police suspect the bomb was planted in the offices of Dr. Anna Nolmar, the psychiatrist believed abducted by one of her own patients. Authorities would not comment... - It's her. - Dr. Nolmar? - Detective Sanchez. - Do you need any medical attention? - Oh I can't tell you how relieved I am to see you, it's been such an ordeal. Eddy! - Grab me! Hold on tight! - Upstairs, go- - do you like this? - Get down, get down. - What are you doing? - Hey there's shooting up there! There's shooting in the balcony! - Quiet. - Aw yes, aw yes, aw yes, aw. Love this. - When I fire, cross. - Okay. - Go. - No! - Oh god! - Over. - What? - Go over. Let go, let go, let 9°! Go, go, go, go! - Eddy, I'm so scared. - I know, I know. We gotta disappear. - Where? - I don't know, I don't know. Maybe I can pay somebody to take us to Mexico. - Sanchez, thought you were in the hospital. - You okay Sanchez? - Good to see you back so soon. - Hey hey, I got stuff for ya. You look like shit. - Oh thanks so much, now what's the story on those deaths? - His name is Kay names of social security, please help yourself, are individuals who died in Vietnam. - Who the hell are they, some crazy vet gang? - No, no see it gets better, see these guys never got near Vietnam. - What? - Each of these stiffs have two separate identities both fully documented. All three are convicted murderers, we're talking some vicious mother fuckers here. - I don't get it. Now you're trying to tell me that all these mother fuckers got sprung. - No I'm trying to tell you that all these motherfuckers got sent to the same cuckoo nest, lang institute. Go figure. - Alright, alright, it's her bank card. - Where? - At the Olvera and Alameda branch. - Call in the guys, we're in business. Get the chopper ready. - She's at an ATM at Olvera and Alameda, estimate you have 35 seconds to get there. She just made a selection, estimate 25 seconds. Estimate 10 seconds. Transaction processed. She's still waiting. - What are you doing? Hurry up- - just a second, I'm just waiting for the receipt. - Fuck the receipt, come on. Get in. Straight to Mexico okay? - Okay senor. - I'm sorry about your father's watch, I know it meant a lot to you. - Well that's okay, I'll live. Maybe. I'm sorry, I haven't cried in years. I didn't even cry at my father's funeral. He trained me to hold back my emotions. He didn't want me to be vulnerable to anything. I suppose I better go and get some local currency. - American magazines, I have all kinds of magazines. Come over here and take a good look at them. - As long as there is poverty in this world... - To much drink eh? - No it's okay I'll talk to him. He's fine thank you, no he's fine, he's fine. - I don't really know what I did. I think I've killed. I can't do this. I'm sorry I can't do this. - Can't do what? - I can't live like this. I have to know what I did. I have to go back. - Where? - The lang institute. - There's nothing there, I called to check for medical records and they told me it's been shut down for 13 years. - Where is it? - Arizona. - Where in Arizona? - Oracle Arizona. - Here we go again. - You married colonel? - No, you? - Oh yes, three kids I've got a son in Harvard. - Car rental, San Diego, silver tourist. - They're on plastic. That means they're gonna have to come up for air again. Send a team down have them stand by, if we do him before tomorrow night we're operational again. - Do you want some? Studies prove it will help you live longer. - Thanks doc. - It's Anna, I think by now you can call me Anna, don't you? - Anna, that's a nice name. - I think you want to take a right up here. Oh, what kind of people would do this? Eddy, Eddy look at this. This doesn't make any sense, military personnel only, no admittance beyond this point. Why would they have something like this in a mental institution? - It's just a bat, it's just a bat. - No, it's hydraulic, the power must have been out for years. Most medical facilities have a backup generator. Holy shit. Is this the place? - This is the place, this was where I started. It feels right, familiar, I just wanna lie down, not go anywhere. This is home, just lie down, shut my eyes, home. - Eddy, Eddy can you hear me? Eddy, Eddy can you hear me? Eddy, shit. - Oh my god, this is me. - This is incredible, totally genius. Eddy, you okay? Eddy? - They made me Eddy Kay, they did it to me. They made me Eddy Kay. I remember, I remember, yes I remember. - Hello Eddy, you're looking good today. - What is your name? Your name is Eddy Kay. - My name is Oliver Dykstra. - Your name is Eddy Kay. What is your name Eddy? Tell me. - My name is Eddy Kay. My name is Eddy Kay. - I'm your girl. - This is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. - That's the man I killed, that's the man I killed. - You didn't kill anybody Eddy, it's not a real memory it's an induced memory. You were brain washed, practically recreated through a sort of rebirth process. These images represent artificial experiences imprinted on your mind, reinforced by pain and pleasure. It's all fake. None of this is real Eddy, you're not a murderer. You're not a murderer. - Oh my god, I'm not a murderer, I'm not a murderer. I'm a... Is this real? This is real. - Talk to me, let it come out, talk to me. Hurry Eddy. Hold onto me. I'm back, I got that stuff that you wanted. I also bought us some new clothes, I think these have had it. Eddy? I'm sorry I keep calling you Eddy but I don't know what else to call you. It's just so difficult to accept what these people did to you. Is it okay if I call my uncle? He's probably worried to death about me. I'd like to place a call, my calling card number is 21365821415381. - We are ready sir but it's your decision. He's surfaced again! - Oh look at you. Are you okay? - Yeah I'm alright, I'm just angry. - Oh god, these look terrible. You know when I was small my mother used to kiss the pain away, didn't yours? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Poor thing. Does it hurt? Look at you. Eddy? Eddy is that you? There's... No, no, no! Ow! - Where is he? - I don't know, I don't know, please don't shoot me, please don't. - Where is he? - I don't know, please believe me, I don't know where he is. - Where is he? - I don't know where he is I don't know! - Say ah. - Please don't shoot me, please don't shoot. - Wait. This will only take a minute. - Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me. - Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me. - Oh god! - Please don't hurt me. - Get off me! Get off me! Don't move. - Make the call. - You don't stand a chance. It will only buy you 24 hours anyway. You won't shoot me in cold blood, you didn't have it in you then and you don't have it in you now. I know you well remember? - Hand me that bigger bottle. - Make the call. - Hello? - It's me. - Where are you calling from? - From oracle. It's done. - Good work, see you at the Duke. - What Duke were you talking about? - I didn't say anything about a Duke. - Oh yes you did, in the parking structure you said you wanted to talk to me about the Duke. What Duke? - The Duke hotel, the new Attorney General Dean Jordan, they're gonna kill him. - When? - Tonight, nine o'clock. You really didn't know, did you? - Can't complain colonel. - Okay move on. - Wanna step through sir? Excuse me. - Where is the restroom? - Straight down the hall sir. - Can I get a shine? - Yes sir, please have a seat. - What time is it? - It's almost eight. - We won't make it. - How about a kiss for good luck? - The man of the hour, the man who is not afraid to expose the truth and a man who feels that America should lead by example as we pave the way for global democracy in the 21st century. I give you the next Attorney General of the United States, Dean Jordan. - I hope we're not too late. - Oh my god! - We have witnessed extraordinary events this past year. - Eddy it's the police. - The right to pursue individual happiness. - Alright, get out of the car.

Are you all right? - The bureaucrats and the politicians have asked me not to rock the boat, not to roll stones that have gathered moss, not to reopen old wounds, Let it be said that there are some dark corners in this great democracy of ours that are afraid of close scrutiny. There must not be a governmental agency that is so mighty as to be allowed to exist outside the laws of this country. - The guy in the brown jacket. Get a man on him. - There he is. - Where? - There! - Get down sir! - Oh shit. - It's over. You hear me? It's over. They used you like they used me, don't you understand that?
