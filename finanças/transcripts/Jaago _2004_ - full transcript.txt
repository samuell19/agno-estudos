JAAGO (Wake Up) I'm ready too. I've only got to pack your lunch "Don't start screaming. I'm ready, as usual" "Give that to me, Mama. - Shradha..." I have a board of directors meeting this evening I'm going to be late tonight. - Mumbai's a strange city Every man is in a hurry That's the beauty of this city too "Every man rushes forth, thinking he will reach his goal today" But no one ever pauses to think what the goal really is That's exactly why no one gets enough to eat... "nor does he leave the city. - Hurry up, Papa!" I won't ever talk to you if I miss the fast train! "Okay, okay... let's go" Will you take us to Marvel School? - Sure. Get in "Hurry up, please! Let's go" "You are the one who has granted us life..." give us peace and tranquility "In just 15 days, our school has its Parents' Day..." "in which there will be dance, drama, fancy-dress..." and several other competitions The students who have been selected for these cultural activities... will have a dress-rehearsal after school hours today "Shruti, just you see. You're going to be chosen for the dance number again" Niki...? This is Shruti's mummy Shruti hasn't returned from school yet There was a dress rehearsal for the Annual Day celebration today She'll be coming home late I see "Thank you, dear" "That's the end of today's rehearsal. You may change and go home, okay?" ls the rehearsal over? "Yes, sir. Just now" All right. Lock the hall and come over I'm expecting some guests for dinner. There's a lot to do. Come at once "Very well, sir. I'll be on my way" Looks like everybody has left Where have they gone? Open the door! Open the door! ls someone there? "Open the door, please!" Someone there...? Somebody there...? Please help me! Please help me! "Open the door, please! Open the door!" "Someone, please help me!" Somebody there...? "Help me, please" "Our company has made astounding progress this year, sir" "I'm sure, next year we'll have even better export orders" Mr Ayub here is... "Yes, Shradha...?" Shruti hasn't returned from school yet "She will, if she hasn't. Telephone her school first" I have a meeting in progress here But... "Telephone the school. I'll call you back after the meeting, okay?" All right Someone please help me! Stop right here! How much? Brother Ramdhani... please open the door "Coming, coming!" "I'm coming, my child" I'll open the door "How did you get locked in, child?" Don't cry... calm down. I'll take you home "No, don't take me home" "Only take me to Bandra Station. - Oh sure, I'll take you there" Don't cry. Calm down "Here you are, my child" "Be careful, okay?" The line's busy Chandu... - What? You got some stuff on you? - lshan... I got all the stuff! This guy has got us into the bad habit "Chandu, you're fit enough to chew only cheap tobacco!" He wants to live like a king and points fingers at me? Go on now... hurry up Take a drag "Your turn, take a drag" You'll find the black-and-white world somewhat coloured Go ahead "Here you are, lshan" Let's go Old man Fatso A black bird No fun WQW! "Why're they shutting the windows, mother?" What are you doing? No! Help! Help! No! You'll be finished if you scream! No! Shut up! Quiet! No! No! "C'mon, Chandu" No! No! Who's in there...? Who? What are you doing? You dare hit me? No! Don't! Shut up! "No, no!" Police...? Step aside... out of the way "Ganpat, the girl's still alive. Send for the ambulance immediately" "Krishna, take photographs" This is Inspector Cruz from Borivali Station Your daughter has been raped We're taking her to the Chhatrapati Hospital A nine-year old girl was raped in a local train of Mumbai today Media persons haven't yet been allowed entry into the hospital Have you been able to find out from any of the sources... "as to who the girl was? - No, Devang" There is still no information on the girl's parents All the police told us is that the girl's parents have been informed They could even be in the hospital right now "Dipti, has the government or the police commissioner..." issued a statement over this outrage? "No, Devang. The Police Commissioner is in the hospital right now" The Chief Minister Prabhudayal More called on the child a little while ago "Dipti, we will stay in touch with you" Do inform us as soon as you get more information. Thank you "Thank you, Devang" "Commissioner, the Railway Police will not handle this case" Entrust the case to the Crime Branch Inspector Karpe This is Inspector Karpe here. The Commissioner wants to see you You've got to come to Chhatrapati Hospital immediately All right The Police force is full of smart and efficient officers But the Commissioner considers only this chap to be the capable one "Three reasons for that, sir. - What?" He's sick! - What ailment does he suffer from? Honesty "He's mad, too. - How come?" He asks everyone to become a good man But how can everybody in the police department become good men? This man has no one of his own to mourn his death Where has his wife gone? She was suffering from the cancer of the uterus "She died last year, without any treatment" The police department has found a slave who will put in 24 hours without pay I wonder why people like him are born in times like these! What have you to say in this regard sir? What step will the police take? Inspector Kripa... you will handle this case from today If you have to kill the guilty persons in an encounter... you needn't even ask me. Simply shoot them Please follow me I've never seen a patient in such a terrible state That child was raped by more than one man I've stitched up the wound and had her shifted to the ICU Doctor... - Don't worry. She'll be all right "Sir, is there anything you wish to say in this regard?" I have issued orders to the Police Commissioner If the offenders are not arrested within 48 hours... all station in-charge officers from Bandra to Borivali will be suspended... and the Commissioner will be transferred "Devang, that was the Chief Minister, who..." "for the first time, issued orders without making a political statement" This is the first time we get to see the stern side of the Chief Minister "Mr Kailash, what would you like to say in this regard?" An act as dastardly and as heinous can happen only in the present regime A regime that has no control over the administration Ever since this government has come to power... "robberies, abductions, rapes and bomb-blasts..." have become part of the common man's life But our party will not remain silent this time! "What will your next step be, sir?" We will submit a memorandum to the President tomorrow... to impose President's Rule in the state at the earliest possible And the whole city will remain closed tomorrow Whenever something happens in this city... your political party announces a closure Who gains out of this? It's for you to assess who gains and who loses "When we call for a closure, it's going to be a closure!" "Devang, that was the leader of the opposition, Kailash Rao Kate" He has issued the oft-repeated and cliched political statement This is Dipti Dayal for Aaj Tak in Mumbai We'll have to work together as a close-knit team "Without cooperation from all of you, I will not be able to do anything" "Kripa, what are your plans?" "From Churchgate to Virar, we mustn't see a single..." "beggar, eunuch, shady characters or porters who do business without license" "if you find anyone suspicious, pick him up" Lock him up I think she'll be all right. - Doctor... the girl's stitches have opened. She's in agony My child... Shruti... "Open your eyes, my child! - Look, Mummy's here!" Why don't you do something? "Bring Shruti back! Call the doctor, please!" "Please do something! - Doctor, please..." No... No! No! Don't let her go! "You wanted to see off Shruti with a lot of love, didn't you?" This is perhaps the send off we were destined to give her No! May God rest Shruti's soul in peace "Children, you may now to go your classes" "Look, Inspector..." "this school has certain norms, certain regulations" Where do your rules and norms go away... when you want eggs and vegetables for your family? Ramdhani has told me what happened Had you not summoned Ramdhani to your house to do the chores... this mishap could have been averted I have said what I had to "I'm not an offender to answer each of your questions, Inspector" "Oh yes, you can't answer my questions. But you can collect the donations" You can have fun with the money the children's parents earn with hardwork... but you can't take responsibility for the children "Mr Principal, if I don't find any further clues on this child..." you're the first one I will throw behind bars A night in the lock-up and the kicks of the policemen... will make you forget that you're a high-handed teacher Hail India "What's this, Shradha? You still aren't ready?" Aren't you going to the office today? "No, Shrikant. Give my resignation letter at my office" Why? "I'm sick of answering people's questions, Shrikant" Those monsters finished our daughter by subjecting her to the outrage I can't bear the idea of people's questions... inflicting rape on my poor Shruti every day hereafter I can't bear it! "Don't cry, Shradha. Please don't cry..." it'll hurt Shruti's soul Sutya... give me a drag. One pull Don't give him a drag. He's here for a free smoke! Just one drag. - Not even one drag This is Brown Sugar. Even if you die... I haven't had any business today. Make him see reason What can I do if you haven't had any business? What will I say to my buddies? "Give me a drag, please. - Don't con us" You're not getting anything. - Sutya... tell Salim to give me a drag. Just one "What do you think, Salim?" Will a temple be built in Ayodhya or will it be a mosque? Temple or mosque... what have we to do? Sutya... ask Salim to give me a drag. Just one pull Tell Salim to give me a drag! - Me thinks... these politicians are conning the public There are so many problems in the country... and nobody even thinks of them There are millions like us who don't get proper food or shelter And these scoundrels talk of temples and mosques Why're you harping on temples and mosques? We have nothing to eat or drink. There's no place to live in Forget about the temple and mosque. Sutya... "give me a drag, please" If I could become the Prime Minister of the country for a day... I'd solve the problem in a jiffy By ordering a garden or a school to be built there Don't give me a drag! I won't tell you either... who were the guys who raped that girl in the train Hey! Sit down... why're you getting angry? "Salim, give it to him. Let him have a drag" Why do you get worked up? "Don't tell anyone about it, okay?" Or you'll land in trouble with the police What happened that night? "If I could get some money, I could start talking, Mr Sawant" "First give me the tip, Sutya" You'll get all the money you want There's no dearth of dough in the narcotics department "Speak. - I have a tip, all right" But it has nothing to do with your department Then? - The rape on the child in the train... I have a witness to that Speak "Let me get high, sir. I'll tell you whatever you want to know after that" "Now look, Dhondu. The more you talk, the more you'll be paid" Who were they? - What do you mean by who they were? The ones who raped her "I don't know that, sir" So what do you know? I've only seen the three people who were in the train at that time When the girl was being subjected to rape Will you able to identify them? "I've been begging in trains for ten years now, sir" Once Dhondu sees someone... his picture is etched on Dhondu's mind "Who? - No, sir" Must surely be on this train Sure? - Yes. They've got to be there So you know for sure that they'll be on this train? "This is routine for me, sir" Ninety percent of the people travel by the same train every day That's the old man My name is Ramnik Vora That night when the child was raped in the train... "did you see it all happening? - Yes, sir" "And yet you remained silent? - Yes, sir" I can understand. You couldn't have stood up to them But you could've raised an alarm and called people to help I was forbidden from doing that Who? Who forbade you? I forbade him. I did My name is Shalini Lokhande Do you know this man? He's Ramnik-bhai Vora "The editor and publisher of the periodical "Seed of Revolution" He had sworn to tread the path of truth and justice He never bowed his head to anyone except God This man was never afraid of anyone And you know how your police department helped him? He went to them with an appeal. And they beat him up like a criminal... and threw him out of the police station. This man was rendered homeless! "From his flat, he landed here in these slums" And what was his crime? He had written a few articles... against the legislator Kailash Rao Kate's corrupt practices He lost the elections and he took revenge from this man He was once a famous man. And today... he sells old books on the pavements of Churchgate Station... and leads a life of anonymity. Only to die some day If your own daughter had to go through the same trauma... what would you have done? "If she had gotten pregnant, I'd have had the baby aborted" "if she had died, I'd have cremated her" "if she had gotten into prostitution, I'd never have spoken to her..." but I'd never have gone to a police station. Never What reason for you to harbour so much of poison for the police department? It's because of your Sub-Inspector Rane He got me a job in the State Assembly and in exchange for that... he has turned me into his mistress for the last eighteen years! "He was man enough to sire a child, but..." My Pooh's getting married next month But he does not have the courage to come and give her his blessings To tell you the truth... I don't know how many backdoors of your police stations... lead to the red-light district Behind every corrupt and deceitful policeman's house lives a Shalini And you ask me about the venom I harbour? Your silence does not answer my question "Inspector, we have just eight hours to meet the deadline" "After that, at least a dozen officers will be suspended" "Sir, I can see only one way out" But I'll need your cooperation for that What cooperation do you want from me? "These politicians play games with us almost every day, sir" Why don't we try a game on them? I will recommend Inspector Kripa's name for the President's medal "In just 48 hours, he has nabbed these thugs..." with the help of his special team They are the ones who had raped that child in the local train "Sir, are they hardcore criminals or is this their first crime?" "Sorry, until our investigations are complete..." we can't disclose these details "Sir, you can at least tell us which gang or group they belong to?" What? Why don't you get over the habit of putting words in our mouth? Please behave like a journalist. Don't try to play a cop "Sir, you can at least tell us their names?" "Forgive me, friend. Revealing their names..." "will alert their friends, their relatives and their accomplices" "And if they are granted bail somehow or the other, you will be..." the first ones to say that the police shouldn't have disclosed their identity So we have to be very careful and we need your help Child-rape has now come to be a major crime Incidents like this keep happening in cities and villages We wish to set an example before the nation... that will be followed by the entire police department "Inspector, just once, I wish to see the faces of those monsters" Looking at the monsters will not kill the monsters What will you gain out of looking at those bastards? Inspector... "what does one get by seeing a venomous cobra, captured in a basket?" What do you get by seeing a wild beast in a cage? What does man gain by kicking the stone... that has hurt him? Whether one gets something or not... "it's surely reassuring, Inspector" Come with me "This is Constable Borkar, Constable Ramakant..." and sub-inspector Patil. Of Mahim police station Does that mean... all that you did before the media... was just a farce? Was it plain deceit? "I ask you, Inspector..." whom have you deceived? Us? The public? Or is it your own selves? This is the reason why no respectable man... encourages a police officer at his doorstep This is the reason why the police are treated like street dogs! "When they bark, people think they are being protected" But when they get down to biting... they bite those who feed them! - I'm not surprised to see... that you hate me as much as the common man hates the police "Mr Shrikant, dogs, elephants and the wise..." are enemies of their own tribe But we in the police are not enemies to our colleagues "Whatever you wish to say, whatever curses you want to heap..." you may go ahead after you've heard my plan Come with me How could you even imagine I'd get into this filth at your say so? "To clean the filth, one has to get into it, Mrs Varma" You're talking rubbish! Why don't you take help from the police department? We have already shown the culprits as arrested And this is something the media has conveyed to every household I can seek only your help in this regard now "Now look, Inspector! We can't give you any help!" All right okay You folks have already done your duty You gave your daughter a burial instead of giving her away in marriage You already gave her a shroud instead of bridal fineries You have buried her instead of making her sit in a palanquin You are also like those parents who after their child's last rites... are absolved of the responsibility of giving them away in marriage! And abuses... you heap on the police! What a shame! "Wait, Inspector" I promise you: neither will you have to visit the police station... "nor testify in court, nor will you be asked any questions" "Once, just once, give me your help in carrying out my plan" I know you had no relations with that child Neither do I. I'm only doing my duty You must also forget everything else and only think of humanity Only humanity What an item! Fab stuff! Are they there? Can't see them yet The moment you do... Shalini... I've missed the train What? You've missed the train? But it'll halt only at Borivali now! What happened? "Sir, they're in the coach" What? "Where's the key? - Here you are, sir" Get to Borivali station Damn it The pierce of the thorn... oh the pierce "Come to me, my love; under the vines in the backyard..." my love... Get back! Help! "Let me go, Inspector!" Get them! Move it! "Step aside, please..." Inspector sahib... Inspector sahib! - What is it? "Sir, I want to meet my wife" I got to know that she is here Shradha. Shradha Verma The Borivali train murder case lady? "Yes, she's the one. She is my wife" You are talking as if she was arrested for fighting for a social cause She has committed a murder. Murder You ought to be ashamed to even call her your wife I'm proud of my wife She has done what you guys should've done Enough! Will you teach a policeman his job? Inspector Kripa has taken your wife to the women's cell Wants to teach me the law "What brings you to the police station so late in the night, Mr Choudhary?" Just now I got to know that one inspector Kripa Shankar... has arrested my son Mayank and Mr Bhandari's son lshan Are they your...? - Right. They are our sons "Please come, sir. I'll take you to them" Let's go "lshan... how are you, son?" "I'm fine, Papa. - Mr Choudhary..." I have a feeling that the boys are being framed in this case "True, Papa. We're innocent. - I know, son" "We've done nothing, daddy. - Even if you have done something..." "you will be released, free of blame. Because you are an I.A.S officer's son" And to use his powers is an administrative officer's birthright "Not to worry, son. Our lawyer Satwani is away in Delhi" "Tomorrow, he returns, so do you, to your bedrooms" "Okay, papa. - Take care, son" "Everything will be all right, son. - Inspector, their food and drinks..." "Don't worry about it, sir. They will have everything they want" "They must have everything, Inspector. They are our sons" "This way. - Yes, papa" That cell Shradha... Don't cry "With a change in mission, life doesn't come to an end" "Until yesterday, it was your duty to rear your daughter" "But now, it is our duty to fight for justice" You have done what any mother would have done Tell Kripa Shankar... to cremate that scoundrel in the same crematorium... where my Shruti was cremated Perhaps her soul will find peace May her soul rest in peace "Yes, I am Chandu's mother" But I'm ashamed of such a son That's why I didn't claim his body nor performed the last rites I'm Kripa Shankar Here's Chandu's death certificate I dreamt to see his degree certificates And I've got his death certificate I'll frame it and hang it up the wall And every day I'll spit at it Why do you talk like that? Look there. I haven't even placed a garland on his picture I drove away all those who came to offer condolences I stopped him a million times... from mingling with those spoilt rich brats "In the company of the rich, he dreamt of making it big" He became a bloody flunkey A mother can forgive her son's thousand crimes But a son who dishonours his own mother... cannot be forgiven A nine-year old girl... is the form of Goddess Durga "During the festival of Navratri, she is decked up and worshipped" They raped her and killed her The dog died. Good I'd rather be childless it is because of women like you that the Mother still lives "I salute you, Mother" Goodbye Sir... Chandu has been punished for his sin But don't spare those rich bastards "Khan, whoever comes on duty next, will thrash these scoundrels" He will also thrash them before he goes off duty When will they be chargesheeted? - After they are thrashed... till they see a mother in every girl with one eye... and a sister with the other. I'm not joking “Ms Khan, R's your tum now“ "You've heard the order, I hope? - I did" Ma! Sister! Come to empathize now? "It was you who said, "To clean filth, you got to jump into the muck" So did you clean the filth? Shradha is in jail because of you "Whatever happened, somewhere along I consider myself responsible" But I promise to do all I can "With this stigma on my name, I won't retire, nor will I die" "Please don't come here again to empathize, or to wipe my tears" I no more trust you and the law Shrikant... the law is like a python's mouth "it appears small, but when it swallows something, it is for good" You will understand it in good time Here's the warrant for searching your house I only want to search your darling son's room "Officer, before my lawyer arrives..." you can't even touch an ashtray in my house Bhandari... "if I act myself, I'll have even the foundation dug up" "Sales Tax, Income Tax, Foreign Exchange..." Revenue and Service Tax... I'll set up one branch each in your house "And, your son, your support in your old age..." "I'll send you to look him up, behind bars" lshan's bedroom is upstairs Thank you Move Satwani... Search the entire room. Don't miss out on anything "Look, sir" "Mr Bhandari, who is that sonofagun? Who is that dog..." who tried to sniff at your house in broad daylight? Who...? He? "Hey Inspector, I'll file a defamation suit against you" You and your seven generations to come will not be able to pay the damages You dig? You don't know me "Advocate Satyaprakash Satwani, MA, LLB, LLM" One tight slap is enough to paralyse you And you will end up begging in front of the court "Satwani, look at this" It's your mother's picture. You have been watching obscene movies... with Bhandari's son "You supply him with cocaine, swine" And this is the money for the cocaine Write that in the report and throw him inside the lock-up "if you have anything to say, say it in court" Take him away "Buddy, I was just joking" Let me say something If you ever call a policeman a dog... I'll beat the shit out of you You will wag your tail at the sight of a policeman Move C'mon "Khan, seal all these things and bring them downstairs" Inspector Kripa Shankar... lam T.P Choudhary Mayank's father I hope you know that I'm an Indian Administrative Service officer Secretary to the Home Ministry Which is under the Chief Minister Mr More "The Home Ministry runs, walks, and even stops, at my command" Are you saying that to threaten me? Or to inform me that your powers can harm me in many ways? I neither thought nor spoke about harming you But one thing is for sure. If you don't soften up... I'll have you thrown away to a place where you'll have... only a table and chair under a tin roof for a police station "You will yearn for the city, the crowd and the freedom" Will you have me transferred? Or will you personally drop me there? "In either case, I'll have ten minutes of time" "And in those ten minutes, I'll kill your son for escaping police custody" While I perform my duty under a tin roof... you will cremate your son under a tin roof Kripa Shankar... I have connections with those people whom nobody dare deny "I'm not stopping you from trying your influence, strength and courage" You should be trying your luck everywhere You are in bad times Hail India Now there's only one way out What's that? - Give and take That slimy inspector is an idol of honesty There's only one way to tackle him. Money Must weigh him in money. - Do whatever you want. I'm ready But who will talk to that inferno? "It hasn't come up for hearing yet. - Hello, Mr Thakur" "I'll get back to you, Sawant" I was passing by... - You thought you'd apologise to me You know the language of the lawyers too well How about coming to the point? If you are free at eight in the evening... "we'll meet up at hotel Sky Garden, sit and..." Discuss give-and-take? Now don't ask me how I know that I know all those things you guys do... "to win your cases, Mr Satyaprakash Satwani" "Then it's final. At 8 pm, under Hotel Sky Garden's roof" Under the roof? - Yes Drink? - Full fledged Imported? - Imported Bye "So Rawani, what does your mentor Satwani say?" "What am I to do? - First have something to drink, sir" We'll talk later. - Look Mr Bhandari... I have no time to waste What am I supposed to do? Tell me. - It's a small task You got to weaken the case of Mr Bhandari's son Frame Choudhary's son and build up a case against Chandu. Simple Mr Satwani asks me to give you 5 million if the court releases my son I don't eat shit "All right, take 10 million. - Damn" "if you fancy frying potatoes in spit, I'd rather leave, Mr Bhandari" Hang on This bag carries all of 15 million "Not a penny less, not a penny more" Anti Corruption Bureau Accepting bribe is a crime Offering bribe is a grave crime Take them away Come on. - But... Move it. - No buts. Come on What about my drink? "Why is the police after my son, sir?" I don't understand. Why is my house being raided every now and then? Could it be the opposition's conspiracy for gaining political mileage? Am I being used in an attempt to throw you out? "What is your opinion on this matter, Mr Choudhary?" "Sir, I think the government must suspend the inspector at once..." and conduct an enquiry against him... so that police stops harassing bureaucrats Has the inspector arrived? Send him in "What's all this farce, Inspector?" "Farce...? What farce, sir?" "if not a farce, Inspector, what else have you turned this rape case into?" Mr Choudhary's son raped a nine-year old girl What's the big deal? Why are you making an issue out of it? A little girl is raped and murdered;... "isn't that an issue, sir? - No. Not at all" "Release his son at once, take him to the Narcotics department..." let him lick some drugs. He has all the freedom... to rape any girl In case he fails to find a girl... we'll offer him our sisters or daughters "Because, I'm not a Chief Minister, and you aren't an officer" The two of us serve as pimps to his son "What are you saying, sir? - Mr Choudhary..." I'm not perfect either So I know too well the difference between right and wrong "And yes, I've transferred you to the Co-operative Dairy department" So that you can instill in him the habit of drinking milk... instead of white poison. Get that? "And Inspector, you!" If you are truly your mother's son... don't stop chasing his darling son until he misses his mother's milk Understand? "Relax, Mr Bhandari... relax. - I've lost face!" "Remember this much, Mr Bhandari" "One who goes to jail once, goes places. It's true" History is witness. Take the cases of famous ministers and actors. It's true Know what? My mentor Bhojwani did the same thing with me on the first case "And look how I've scored. - What are you saying, sir!" Which means even I'll become a famous lawyer some day? "Mr Bhandari, in our country, bail means freedom" So let's celebrate your freedom with your best friend Choudhary Come on The Chief Minister is a bloody opportunistic snake He was making him do all illegal activities "And now, he gets him transferred" Votes and money alone don't sate him We grow poor because we give. But these corrupt ministers... "no matter how much they take, they don't seem to grow richer" I don't understand... why he changed amour 'm my son's case "Media. Media, Mr Choudhary" If the media offers someone space... even spirits start singing praises "Manpower, money power, political power media is the greatest of all powers" If the media makes an issue out of something... even the bravest of men would not dare to touch it The Chief Minister is but a small fry More than him it is the inspector who earns a paltry 5000 bucks... who is much arrogant Must do something about him "Don't get into that mess, Mr Choudhary" Am I not with you? Unless I get his uniform auctioned in court... I'm not Satyaprakash Satwani Once our boys are placed under judicial custody from police remand... then watch what magic I work This way "Mr Satwani, your boys will be offered the place they choose" That barrack belongs to the A Company B Company's gangsters are housed in the opposite barrack D Company's boys are kept in the barrack at the far end This barrack has boys from the E Company Really? - Yes. The gangster Eliyaz's boys "Dangerous, merciless sharpshooters" Hey jailer! Come here! "That's the don, Eliyaz Ansari. E Company" "They are the slinks who raped a little girl, aren't they?" "Yes bhai, they are the ones (Bhai - Don)" Send them to my cell My boys have been starving since long. They are thirsty too We'll pump enough manly venom into them... to their change their damn blood groups Send them "Jailer, could you find a cell exclusively for our sons...?" "Exclusive, please... - Possible" "Jailer, our boys are not used to sleeping on the floor" "Mattresses, pillows, blankets... - Yes" everything will be organised Tell me something. What type of toilet would they prefer? Indian? Or Western? "Jailer, never in their lives have the poor chaps seen an Indian type toilet" It's hard to squat. A western type toilet will be organised And food...? Home cooked? Or from hotel? "Home cooked would be just fine, sir. - Wonderful, wonderful" Cigarettes? Liquor? Anything...? - Oh no "You want, my boys? - No, Satwani, no" No harm in asking them. - What he's offering is enough "To avail of these facilities... - What is it, jailer?" Tell them. Everything comes for a price I'll make it cheaper because I respect Mr Satwani "A private room will cost 100,000 a week" "Mattresses, pillows and blankets will cost 50,000" Will they use a phone? - Yes "10,000 for that. And when you bring food..." keep 5 notes of 1000 denomination under it "Every time you bring food, please" Hey jailer! - Yes bhai! What's up? Why haven't you sent the boys inside yet? "I have cooled the boys down. Send them in, pronto" Hurry up and tell me. - We agree to all your conditions "But put our boys in a separate cell, not with them, please" Trust me. All right? - Perfect "I'm very sincere with my dishonest dealings, too" "Telgi, I told you! No!" Eliyaz-bhai... "Sorry, bhai. Carry on, please" Munna will manage the rest. Call me later "What is it, jailer?" "Made a deal, Eliyaz-bhai. Fifty percent for my staff" Twenty-five for your boys. - What about the other twenty-five? "Goes to that bloody parasite, the dog Satwani" He's a damn old warhorse He runs a coalition government on the whole damn case Just for the sake of humanity... thrash the rich spoilt brats tonight. Beat the bloody shit out of them At least the kid's soul will find some peace "Worry not, bhai. Everyone will be at peace" "Everyone will relax. Bye. Carry on the phone conversation, bhai" Papa! Are you still sleeping? "Hurry up, else I'll be late" What if I miss the fast train? When did you arrive from Australia? I just kept my luggage inside and hurried here to wish my darling baby Where is she? It's her birthday today Remember what she said when I was leaving for Australia? "Look aunt, you may go wherever you want to" But make sure you are here on my birthday with my gift "Else, I'll never talk to you" "You mustn't say that, dear. - Did I ever miss your birthday?" "This time too, I won't. I'll certainly come on your birthday" "What is the matter, Shrikant? Why are you quiet?" "Shruti is no more, Mrs D'souza" Get down Son... how are you? Are you all right? Just obey your orders. No need to worry Go on "Just don't worry, Mr Choudhary" For the last fifteen years I've been giving the law this very antidote My clients lshan Bhandari and Mayank Choudhary... have no criminal records They belong to respectable families They are down with food poisoning eating jail food "To respect the court of law, they've been presented here" They are in a very bad shape. that's why I request the court... I request the court to send my clients to the hospital immediately... for treatment Permission granted "That's a lawyer's magic. There's more to come, just watch" "Satwani, I'm honest, not stupid" You can pull wool over the eyes of the court... but I know you inside out Reason with him If you cross my path in this battle of law... "I'll shove all your knowledge of law right there, where you came out from" The name is Eliyaz-bhai. Eliyaz Ansari "Newspapers, TV, radio, public..." everyone is scared of taking my name My name's linked to everything that happens in this city You did a great thing But why did you spare the other one? The gun was country-made. I found it in the crematorium It carried only one bullet "I rule in here, as I do outside" Would you like to have something? I have a personal kitchen here I'm not hungry How long will you starve? Two days? Four days? Five days? Know what? There's a disaster greater than death Hunger "if not for yourself, you must at least live for the sake of your wife" You know my wife? I respect those who commit murder What the two of you did was just appropriate it hardly takes time to commit a crime. If justice is not given pronto... everyone will do what the two of you did But I won't let you guys rot in jail But the law... - Ten years in the path of crime! I have enough experience of the law I can tell you the court's verdict right here Your wife will be exonerated "As for you, my lawyer J.K Saxena, will get you released" This is the new twist in the case. Eyewitnesses! "Who, saw the rape being committed with their own eyes" The curtain on this matter is being raised only today in court "No one ever saw them before on TV, nor read about them newspapers" So where did these eyewitnesses transpire from? "Mr Kripa Shankar, I wish to ask you a question" Who are these eyewitnesses? And where are they? They can't come to court to testify Why not? - Well... they have their own set of problems "His answer is enough to nullify the entire case, Your Honour" "To get my clients arrested, the eyewitnesses had no personal problems" "But now, when it comes to testifying, they come up with personal problems" "The truth is, there's no eyewitness in this case at all" "Eyewitness, there is" "Not one, but three persons have witnessed the rape" "I'll present all of them in court tomorrow itself, Your Honour" The court is adjourned till tomorrow I have lost faith in this world "The cop is not willing to sell himself, the prosecution is not yielding either" "And now, three eyewitnesses have sprung up!" Who the hell are they? We'll find out soon He's not here as yet There! Our succour is here My Lord... what kept You so long from manifesting? Welcome This is Mayank Choudhary's father. Mr T.P Choudhary And he is... - ACP Sawant. Narcotics Department Best friend of Kripa Shankar Thakur "My Lord, what will You have?" I don't take tea and coffee free of cost Everything else will do Waiter! Three large Blue Label For me "What about you? - Not on Mondays, please" "Business, Satwani? - We've already done that on the phone" "All that remains to be done, is give and take" What's your price? How much will you offer? - 20 million. Cash Who are the eyewitnesses on this case? Check upstairs The old man is away. It's locked. Damn! Hurry. Call up bhai "Sir, Shalini Devi here. Our lives are in danger" What...? - Yes sir. Ramnikbhai just told me Some men had come to kidnap him. - Stay put. I'll be there You will not move anywhere. Get that? I'll be right there All right "Pooja, go and shut the door" Don't move Sawant sahib? - Go on Bhai here Job done How much did you sell out for? 20 million "For the sake of money, you sold out on your honesty, duty, integrity..." and even my trust in you? "Be practical, my friend. Be practical" I paid 10 million to be transferred to this department The next ACP is waiting with 15 million to take over from me Jobs were on sale earlier. Now transfers are sold out Because of officers like you the entire police department... has been turned into a money-making machine "Had I been in your shoes, Sawant..." I'd have pumped all six bullets into the chest of the buyer This department desperately needs police officers like you You are like those faithful dogs... "who are used in sermons on ideals, principles and medals" "People like you join the force as inspectors, no doubt..." but you guys die just as inspectors! "People like you are used, my dear Kripa..." and people like me are sold! And that is our police department! Does that mean you're not going to give me any help in this case? "Whether he helps or not, I surely will" Pick up Bhai and Chhotu and hand them over to Kripa You get that? Why were we asked to come here? To ask you guys for the answer... to just one question Had you guys given out a contract to finish those three eye-witnesses? Contract...? What contract? Borkar "You were talking at the top of your voice in court, Mr Satwani" And your voice is stuck in your throat right now? "Chhotu! - Yes, sir?" "Bhai... - Yes, sir?" How much did you guys collect to bump off Ramnik and those women? "Half a million, sir. - That's the present rate, sir" What did you do to them? "We killed the three of them and threw them in the gutters, sir" "Khan... - Yes, sir?" Take off their handcuffs Shove an old revolver in their hands and show this is an encounter death "One thing you'd better remember, Satwani" Don't play around with the law in my case "Perhaps you don't know. I was born in Bihar, brought up in U.P..." where every family gives birth to three politicians... two thugs and an administrative officer If you act smart with me ever again... "I'll put so many slugs into you, you sonofabitch..." that even a pauper will become a millionaire by selling the copper You heard that? "That was meant for you, too" Hail India Hail India! Say it Hail India Hail India Let's go "Your Honour, where are the eye-witnesses?" Those that my friend Saxena intended to present in court? "The truth is, Your Honour..." there never was an eye-witness in this case! "This is a conspiracy, a frame-up..." in which my client Mayank Chaudhary has been implicated! In which were killed his friends lshan Bhandari and Chandu Prasad "To expose this conspiracy, I seek your permission..." to summon Mrs Shradha Varma to the witness box Permission is granted Mrs Shradha Varma... in a dress like this one on the train that night... were you going to participate in a fancy-dress competition? I have a strong hatred for such clothes... that makes half the city view the one wearing it as half clad And half the city thinks she's absolutely naked "In this dress, I wanted to trap the rapists" "She's telling lies, Your Honour! Absolute lies!" "Your Honour, clothes like this one on trains and streets..." "in the middle of the night, are worn only by prostitutes!" Mr Satwani! It's lawyers like you who provoke women... who probe so much to bring the matter to a situation... where the women either back off out of helplessness... or become shameless enough to reveal... when and what they were actually put through Lawyers like you ought to go and ask their mothers... how your fathers had impregnated them! You can very well misbehave with a woman in a crowded court... and no one can have any objection "But when I ask you a simple question, you jump around with objections?" "Your Honour, I'm glad my daughter is dead" How could the poor girl say what she was subjected to? I have committed a murder. And I admit to it I'm not here to defend my crime I'm here only to seek justice for my child! For how long? For how long shall a mother beg for justice... for the atrocity perpetrated on her child? Why does this country not formulate a law... where a rapist is sent straightaway to the gallows? Child rape! "That's the menace plaguing all our cities, towns and villages today" So why don't we put up a fight against it? Why aren't there any tough laws? Mr Judge... I beg you You must deliver a verdict... which brings about a revolution in the annals of Indian legal history Which makes every monster who inflicts rape on little girls... shudders a hundred times before he does something as heinous! A hundred times! Mr Judge... I don't want to answer any questions "What I had to do, I've already done" And I have no regrets about it "What punishment I'm likely to get, I don't care either" "Our world is devastated anyway, Mr Judge" "I have just one request, Mr Judge" You must deliver a verdict... which will prevent the poison of rape... from ruining anymore lives Our daughter must get justice while we live So that every parent has faith in the court... and the laws of our country "That's it, Mr Judge. I have nothing more to say" Nothing more Mr Judge... I'm ACP Sawant. From the Narcotics Department "These are the three eye-witnesses, Mr Judge" "Shalini Devi, her daughter Pooja and Mr Ramnik Vora" "They have witnessed Chandu Prasad, lshan Bhandari and Mayank Chaudhary..." commit the heinous rape on Shruti Varma I request the court to record their testimony today itself "Mr Judge, I'm Shalini Lokhande" "The day this incident occurred, we were in the same coach" The terrible things these three boys did to the poor child... this chap was one of them "The poor child wept and cried for mercy, for help..." to no avail! One of these boys threatened us with a knife "This boy was one of them, sir! We saw him there!" You must punish him sir! Where's my wife and kid? They're with me. Safe and sound When are they coming back to me? "Once their testimony is recorded, you'll have them back" How did you get to know that these witnesses were with me? "Sawant, I'm a cop too. I know you too well" You can't ever kill someone for 20 million A killing you will negotiate for not less than 50 million I had found the bodies of the three dummies If we in the police start abducting each other's families... what difference will there be between us and the underworld? "Lots of difference, Sawant. They still have a bit of honesty left" Papa! "Use whatever ploy you want to in this case, Kripa..." you aren't going to win You have been transferred today. Chaudhary has been pulling the strings "Your Honour, it's already five" I therefore request the court to announce a new date of hearing "No, Your Honour! No!" They will get a new date of hearing from the court every other day... and these criminals will get a new lease of life! "I beg you, Mr Judge..." do not fix another date of hearing I appeal to you "Actually, I have no right to say anything in this case anymore" That's because I have been transferred And that's because I did my duty with all the honesty "A policeman, the entire police department is viewed as corrupt" As dishonest thieves and corrupt people Those that join the police force for 30 years... are turned into corrupt thieves by the politicians... who assume power only for five years Another police officer will step into my shoes... "and the poor man, out of helplessness, will turn the whole case in their favour" This poor old man will be shot dead... And these two women will be subjected to something... that will make them scream at the sight of any male... or they will be paraded naked on the streets... and declared insane! Whom are we to trust? "Whom do we turn to, Mr Judge?" Society is full of criminals... who have made it to Parliament only on the strength of their bullets The day is not far when they will fire at each other even in parliament Every corrupt politician has just one thing to say They say that unless the courts declare them guilty and criminals... they are innocent "if they are indeed innocent, Mr Judge..." why is a case being heard against them in court? "This nation is sitting on a volcano, Mr Judge" And instead of thinking of doing something for the nation... instead of formulating new laws... they keep fighting each other like wild animals Is this the pride and honour of our nation? "If the people in this country believe in anyone, it's the judiciary, the courts" And it's the judiciary that is actually running this country "Before that judiciary, therefore, I beg with folded hands..." that there are police officers who are willing to die on duty But at least their shrouds ought to be protected! "This appeal has nothing to do with this case, Your Honour" "it has, Mr Judge. It certainly has" What I'm saying is the naked truth! Crime against children and women are a grave problem... facing the country... but nothing is done or thought about in this regard! Whoever goes through this trauma is too scared... when faced with police apathy In the tussle of money and power... investigation is itself put to a stop Or they are made to face enquiries But whether any enquiry has ever yielded a decision... the people of this country haven't even read in fairy-tales! Every witness turns hostile in court And Why? The case drags on for so long that... the girl goes beyond marriageable age in making the round of the courts... "and if it's a woman, she grows old!" "And those that are old, die!" "Why is this the case, sir?" All this can come to an end only when... "a single court hears such cases, in a single hearing..." where a verdict is delivered... "without another hearing, another appeal or another court!" I therefore appeal to you... to dismiss the court only after you have delivered a verdict "The arguments of the lawyers, the testimony of witnesses..." and the evidence made available... this court honourably acquits Shradha Varma and Shrikant Varma The accused Mayank Chaudhary is held guilty of the crime "For raping and killing the child, Shruti Varma..." this court sentences Mayank Chaudhary to death Right in front of your eyes This court directs the parents of the child... Shradha Varma and Shrikant Varma... to personally hang the culprit The court orders Inspector Kripa to take the accused to the gallows Let me go! Leave me alone! I've made a mistake! Please let me go! No! No! "After delivering the verdict, I handed in my resignation" I don't know how those who know the law... will react to my decision "What I do know, however, is that I have done justice to my soul" I have truly awakened It's time you awakened too
