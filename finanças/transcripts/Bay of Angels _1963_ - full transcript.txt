BAY OF ANGELS - Checked twice. - You got the other one'? - Which one? - Davidson. Thanks. Something wrong? I'm beat. I've got to forget numbers. I'll take you home. - How? - In my car. You have a car? Since when? - Yesterday. - This is yours? - Surprised? Yeah, a little. - You inherit some money? - Curiosity will kill you. We earn about the same, and I hardly get by. - Don't exaggerate. - I could never afford this. Since you insist, I'll tell you, but keep it a secret. I won a wad at roulette last week. - Where? - The new gaming room at Enghien. A lot? 1,800,000. But my wife doesn't know. - You're kidding. - I swear. She must know you can't afford this. I told her I took out a two-year loan. She believed me. - So you're living a lie. - I have no choice. I'm not leaving my wife, and I have to gamble. Want one? - No, thanks. She suspects, though. I lost a lot once and got into debt. I couldn't keep the truth from her. We had a terrible scene. She made me swear on our kid's life that I'd stop. I promised. Now I play on the sly. You can't imagine what it's like. You've never gambled? - No. I don't know why. It's a bit like drugs. I think if I got started, I'd never stop. There's no comparison between gambling and drugs. You know exactly what you're doing. It's very stimulating. Come along next Saturday. I'd rather not. You have to try everything, learn who you really are. You might be really lucky. You ought to come. Even if you don't gamble, you'll find it interesting. Perhaps. Evening, Dad. - It's 7:00 already? - Caron drove me home. - He has a car? - He bought a DS. - Is he that rich? - He won gambling. - What kind of gambling? - Roulette, at Enghien. Then he'll sell it next week. - Why? - Gamblers always lose. - I'm out of money. - I gave you 10,000 last week. You try doing the shopping! Just warm up the soup. Good-bye. Good-bye, Marthe. I've known a few gamblers. They all ended up penniless. Like Ripert. You met Ripen. It was his downfall. He wrote bad checks and went bankrupt, and his wife left him. She was tired of begging for 50 francs. Now he's all alone. Know what he does? He's a night watchman. There's no shame in that, but when a man's run a large business and lived like a prince, you have to admit it's sad. And it didn't cure him. He still gambles during the day. - Where? - In cafés. To each his own. I hope you never take it up. If I ever hear you're gambling, you can pack up and get out. That's nice. Your mother would say, “Twelve fishermen, 12 hunters, and 12 gamblers makes 36 loafers.” I don't need a loafer around here. I'm old enough to decide. You can do as you like, but so will l. - Bad news. - What's wrong? I lost a lot after dropping you off last night. - How much? - I can't tell you here. I have to win it back. Mr. Fournier, the manager would like to see you. - You start vacation Saturday? - Yes, sir. - Give Mr. Fournier his pay. - Yes, sir. Please sign here. You must come Saturday. I need you there to win. - Right! - I can feel it. You have to come. - When? - Saturday, I said. I can't. I have lots to do. Come or I'm done for. I'll try, but I can't promise. - How much you plan to bet? - I don't know. Five thousand? You have to bet more to win big. I took all the money I had left. It's double or nothing. I'm going all the way. I don't even know the rules. I'll explain it all. You'll see. it's child's play. - I don't have a card. - They'll give you one. - For how long? - I don't know. - Get the minimum. - Which is? - Two weeks. - I'm not coming back. Stop being so difficult. Sorry! May I see some ID? You're all thieves! Be quiet! Don't make me call the police. Please just leave. - Don't touch me! I'll make a scandal! - I wouldn't try it. I'll have this place closed down! - Please leave. - Crook! You have the manners of a stablehand! - Who's that? - An industrialist's wife. Big gambler. - Why did they throw her out? - I don't know. Inform everyone. She's not allowed in the casino anymore. Hello. Not very gallant of you. We can't keep upsetting our clientele, sir. She received a first warning last week. - Was she cheating? - Not exactly. The usual ploy. She tried to rob us twice. Anyway, let's put this incident behind us. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Come on. We've lost enough time. Thirty thousand in chips of 5,000. Five thousand. - Chips of 200 or 500? - Five hundred. That won't go far. - What's that? - To note what numbers come up. - What for? - Helps predict what's coming. Thirty-six, red, even, passe. Last three split. Minimum bet is 500. Maximum is 15,000. I don't understand a thing. For instance, you put 10,000 on 5. You can win 35 times your bet - 350,000 francs, plus your bet, or 360,000. - For every number? - That's right. - What's red, black, odd, even? - Hang on. They only double your bet. - It's hardly worth it. Sure, it's better odds. You've got a 1-in-2 chance, as opposed to 1 in 36. Thirteen, black, odd, manque. Ah-hah... 13. There are also trio, split, and square bets. - “Split”? - Like that. Two numbers at once. But it pays half as much. You know as much as me now. You'll learn the rest as you go. What should I bet on? - Now? We came here to bet. - Thirteen. - It just came up. A number rarely comes up twice in a row. But sometimes. Suit yourself. I'm betting on 13. This is crazy. Thirteen. - How much you bet? - Ten thousand. Five hundred is enough for me. Place your bets. No more bets. Thirty-three, black, odd, passe. Maybe you're not lucky after all. - I don't get it. - Simple: You chose a bad number. Seven, and the first dozen. Thirteen. Never keep playing the same number. No more bets. Thirteen, black, odd, manque. - Pure luck. - Luck counts in a game of chance. - Who bet on 13? - I did. 17,500. Place your bets. - Twenty-four. You sure? Do as you like, but leave me alone. Square, 20-24. Twenty-four. For the staff. For the staff. Three. Three, red, odd, manque. Let's go or I'll start losing. - Let's play a bit longer. - Suit yourself. I'm leaving. 480,000. 410,000. You weren't daring enough. With your luck, you could have won more. - Or lost it all. - You should have kept going. I could feel my luck was turning. - What are you thinking about'? - Nothing. Gambling. It's immoral. I won six months' pay in an hour. - You can lose it too. - That's no better. - What will you do with it? - I don't know. Take a trip. - Go to the Riviera. - Why? We could meet up there. Nice and Monte Carlo are great. You can win big. The stakes are higher. It's a different world. People there live for gambling. I'm going to Cannes. I have good friends there. I always spend my vacations with relatives in the country. I'd never hear the end of it. Besides, gambling's fun, but limited. - It felt good to win, right? Yes, but I still feel uneasy about it. I did nothing to deserve that money. It's like I stole it. - Idiotic reasoning! - Thanks a lot. See you soon. On the Riviera. We'll see. Your uncle wrote. They're expecting us next week. Your room's ready. - I'm not going. - Why? I want to travel. You can travel later. You're young. - Not that young. - You've always enjoyed it there. I've changed. - You know what it costs to travel'? - Yes. “An arm and a leg.” - Don't count on me to help. - I won't. Fine! Spend all your savings in three weeks! - They're my savings. - You should buy shirts. Shirts? I'll show you shirts. Dozens and hundreds of shirts! What's this? The other day you said - I had no money? Well, today I have. It happens. There's plenty out there. - What did you do? - Nothing bad. I gambled and won. I've been the studious, mild-mannered boy up until now. That's over now. I need something else. Don't worry. I won't end up like Ripert. My feet are firmly on the ground. And I intend to win even more. So Uncle can wait. How much did you win? 500,000 in less than an hour. It's immoral, but no more than anything else. No more than poverty or ugliness. I won't be responsible for your gambling debts. - Meaning? - I won't have a gambler here. - So you're turning me out? - Get out. - Don't say it twice. - Get out. A room, please. Show the gentleman to 18. Please fill out this form, sir. Will you be staying long? - About two weeks. Is the Promenade des Anglais far? - Two minutes away. Straight ahead, then left. - And the casino? - On the promenade? The big white building on the right. Are you going to gamble? - Is there some problem? - I couldn't care less. But give me one week in advance as security. You never know with gamblers. Some lose everything, and when it's time to pay - I need a card. - For how long? - A month. Your ID, please. Have you been here before? - No. A thousand francs. 100,000. - Plaques or chips? - Chips. - 5,000s or 10,000s? - 5,000s. Place your bets. Thirteen. Five thousand on 13. No more bets. Twelve, red, even, manque. Thirteen. Five thousand on 13. No more bets. Nine, red, odd, manque. No more bets. Thirteen, black, odd, manque. Place your bets. - Seventeen. Five thousand on 17 for madame. Seventeen. Five thousand on 17 for the gentleman. Thirty-five, black, odd, passe. - Three. - Five thousand on 3. - Three. - Five thousand on 3 for madame. Three, red, odd, manque. 175,000 for madame's 5,000 francs. 175,000 for the gentleman. - For the staff. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - Are you talking to me? - Yes. - It was just luck. - If you say so. What do you suggest? Seventeen has a good chance. Why 17? Why not? Seventeen. Seventeen. Seventeen, black, odd, manque. 175,000 for 5,000 francs. Place your bets. Twenty-one. Twenty-one. 350,000 for the 10,000 on 21. Eight. 350,000 for the 10,000 on 8. - For the staff. - Thank you, sir. - Let's go or we'll star': losing. - You sure? We're winning! I'm positive. 850,000. 900,000. It's funny. It's really funny! What is? Well, no, it's not so funny. I mean, you know, life has its tricks. - Its oddities. Know what I mean? - Not really. When you came along, I'd lost everything. - Your money? - And my jewels. Then you came along. I was on my last chip when you said to bet on 3. Ice cream? - No, thanks. A strawberry ice cream. No, coffee. No, strawberry. A hundred francs. I couldn't even get back to Paris. I had bet my train ticket. I mean, the money for it. - You're right. That's not funny. - Oh, but it is. Want some? It's not very good. I mean, not very - - Very what? Not very - Ah, to heck with it. - What was I saying? - That it was funny. Oh, right. When I left my hotel this morning, I'd really decided to go back to Paris. I went to the station with my bag. I had just enough money. As I was about to buy my ticket, the urge came over me. I left my suitcase there and came back here, almost against my will. You understand? I gambled all afternoon, hoping to make up my losses. Like a fool I kept playing 17, sure it'd win, but no. I was losing my train money, but I thought to myself, “If not Paris, I can get as far as Dijon.” Then it was Lyon. Then it was hitchhiking. With my last chip I couldn't even get to Marseille, so I gambled that away too. - Like in Enghien. - Enghien? I believe I saw you there. You're mistaken. I don't know Enghien, unfortunately. They say it's nice, as resorts go. - I thought - - It wasn't me. Maybe we met in Deauville. I was there a lot last winter. - I've never been there. - Then you're just mistaken. What if you'd lost your last chip? I've been in that predicament before. I'd have slept in the station and then gone to Marijds. She's a friend. She's helped me out twice before. I promised her I'd stop gambling last time. - Why? - Why what? Why did you promise? To reassure her. I had no intention of quitting. The name's Jacqueline Demaistre. Jackie to my friends. You? Jean Fournier. I don't see what's so - No, I'm laughing because I'm starved. I realize I haven't eaten in two days, except that ice cream. I'll treat you. I'd like - if it's all right with you - I'd like the best, with a terrace, a band, and champagne. - This was a funny idea. - Doesn? it ever happen to you? Actually, this is all new to me. I didn't think such a lifestyle existed anymore. Don't get me wrong. I mean... except in the movies or certain American novels. What lifestyle? This hotel, this terrace, this band. This opulence. And you. Me? So I'm like an American novel? A character in a novel, yes. That's funny. I'd never thought about it. I love this song. You like to dance? I'm not a good dancer. I feel like moving. - Go ahead. - No, you first. I'd like to ask you a question. Why do you gamble? It's simple. No other pleasure can compare to the pleasure I get from gambling. When I was married, I gambled on the sly. Did I step on you? Not you. Someone kicked me. - He didn't know? - Who? Your husband. Not at first. You know how it is. But I've always been passionate. I can't help it. Then a strange thing happened: Pierre became jealous of my passion. So jealous! You can't imagine how jealous! But perhaps you're the jealous kind too. Not at all. Go on. It was absolutely ridiculous. He begged me to stop, but I couldn't. And it wasn't the money. Pierre's rich. No, it was pure jealousy. Scenes, fits of anger. Everything I hate. Living together was unbearable, so I asked for a divorce. Thanks for indulging me. I took all the blame. He got custody of Michou, my little boy. I got nothing. Just the right to see him once a week. My husband offers me money, but I always refuse. Today I could have said, ”Pierre, I'm on the Riviera. I need money.” He'd have sent it at once. But I don't need him. I can manage by myself. - You're proud. - No, I'm really not. But why drag up the past'? Look. This is Michou last summer. - How old is he? - Three. The check, please. I don't know why, but I feel my luck's come back. Do you ever get that feeling? - What feeling? - It's hard to explain. If I went back to the casino right now, I'm sure I'd win every time. Come with me. I'm going to my hotel. I'm tired from gambling so much. I promise we won't stay long. Believe me, you must never let luck pass you by. Come on. 500,000. How would you like it? 100,000, 50,000, 10,000, and 1,000. Here you are. 300,000... 450,000... 480,000... and 500,000. - Sir? - 500,000. - Same thing, sir'? - Same thing. What's your luck say? - It says three. No? - Perhaps. Thirty thousand on 3. I bet on 5. - You shouldn't. - We'll see. Then let's both play 3 and 5. Thirty thousand on 5. Three... and red. - No more bets. Thirty-five, black, odd, passe. Place your bets. Thirty thousand on 7. 200,000 on red. - What are you doing? - I have to win. And you? Seven and red. You seem so sure. Thirty-three, black, odd, passe. - I don't get it. - Play the third dozen. - You think so? - It's obvious. - Where are you going? - I'm out. I need more chips. Thirty-one and 35. 150,000 on black. Three, red, odd, manque. Take my place. I'm all out. It didn't work. But we're going to win. I can feel it. 300,000 in plaques of 100,000. Give me 50. - He tried to cheat. - How? Ask the croupier. He tried to steal that woman's stack of chips. Calm down, please. The game continues. - What happened? - The croupier gestured, and they came and took that man away. Seventeen. Black. Eleven. Black. Nineteen, red, odd, passe. - That's that. - What? - I'm out of chips. - No more money? I changed it all. And you'? Me too. How much you have left? Thirty thousand, and about as much at the hotel. Lend it to me. Your 30,000. You'll lose it. You have more at the hotel. I'll pay you back tomorrow. You won't be able to. You'll lose it. How do you know? We're both out of luck tonight. Let's go. Lend it to me. Ask the casino for a loan. I can't ask them for any more money. I can't give them enough security. Then stop playing- I have to win. I'm broke. I admit I was reckless. I swear I'll pay you back tomorrow. I'll bet on 23. I'm sure to win. You're stupid. - Thanks. Twenty-three, quick. Twenty-three, red, odd, passe. - I'll never forgive you. - I'm sorry. - Now lend it to me. - What number this time? - Seventeen. - Why? Don't argue. Give it to me. Seventeen. Thirty thousand on 17. No more bets. Nine, red, odd, manque. Let's go. - I'm such an idiot! - There's nothing we can do. I get had every time. I'm never gambling again. You're just saying that. Come off it. I forced you to come. You were tired. I half wanted to. You only say that to make me feel better. Gambling is stupid. I behaved like a lunatic. I'm furious. Forget it. I'm thirsty. We have enough for a scotch'? I have some change. Five, six, seven... 730 francs. Nothing. Oh, 1,000 francs! We're saved. - How much? - Fifteen hundred francs. We can't afford another? What will you do? You made me yawn. I'll go and sleep. I could go to Marijo's. It's a bar like this. Bars are all alike. She'd have no room anyway. No, I'll go to the station. - The waiting room. - You know it? A little. I'm really sleepy. We'll get your bag from the station and go to my hotel. I'll get you a room. You'll sleep better there than on a bench between a cop and a soldier. You're very kind. There's no bell. There's no one around. No point waking everyone up. I can sleep just fine in a chair in your room. And we'll save money. Make yourself at home. There are hangers there and an armchair there. You often sleep in rooms of men you don't know? - I know you. - I could be a con man. What would you con me out of? I'm broke. As for the rest, I'm not shy. - I guessed as much. And what's it mean to “know” somebody? I'm here with you. I could be with another man in another room. My husband, say. I know him no better than you. So him, you, or another man - it's all the same to me. Is that the bathroom? May I? When I'm broke, I gamble by myself. I've spent whole days in hotel rooms doing that. Whole Sundays. You ever done that? - No, never. - What? - I'm not a real gambler. - When did you get here? - This morning. - On vacation? - Yes. It needs ice. I could try to get some sent up, but a hotel like this - Don't bother. I see a Sioux's head. Where? There. The feathers, the eyes. You see it? Someone really kicked me hard. Now I've got a run. I lied to you earlier. I know Enghien very well. They kicked me out of the casino because - it's none of my business. You really don't want to know? Jean, give me the courage to leave tomorrow. I dreamed you were leaving. And when I woke up, you weren't there. For a moment, I didn't know if it was a dream or not. - What did that make you feel? - I don't know. Nothing. At least you're honest! I mean, it felt kind of funny. Don't get all sentimental. Anyway, I'd have said good-bye first. - Have you decided what to do? - Yes. I'm going back to Paris. You know the time? Half past noon. No breakfast? - I don't have time. No, I'm going to go see Marijo. Not at her bar. At her place. Well, her boyfriend's. Then I'll go to the station to wait for my train. - I could give you some money. - Don't bother. Marijo owes me a bit. She's a funny girl. She was a big gambler. One day she'd had enough. She took a bold step - Are you listening? She got herself banned from the casinos by writing to some government office. I could never do that. Smart, huh? Yes. Let me do that. I admire her. When the temptation got strong, she'd go to Italy to gamble, but the trips cost so much that she gradually stopped entirely. She doesn't gamble anymore. She runs that bar. I think I've got everything. Thank you. Good-bye, Jean. I may not see you again. I could leave my address in Paris. If you like. 4 rue Louis-le-Grand. Near the Opéra. - I know. Good-bye. Jackie, I'll be on the beach. If you have a moment before your train - Yes, maybe. I didn't think you'd come back. Me neither. Yet here I am. I waited an hour for Marijo. She was still asleep. When she came down with her guy, we had to chitchat. I didn't want him to know. After he left, I had to argue and persuade her. She said she had no money. Lies, of course. In the end I got 20,000 francs out of her. Then I walked to the station. Why did you come back? To say good-bye- To say good-bye, or to gamble one last time, like yesterday? I don't know. I wanted to stay here longer. Here or Paris - what's the difference? You have to be somewhere. And no one's waiting for me there. At least the weather's nice here. What about Michou? I feel like I gambled him away too. Anyone waiting for you? - No, no one. What do you do? - What? - For work. In a bank. I give chips away, like here. You live alone? With my father. My mother's dead. Don't you want to get married'? I was engaged once, but at the last moment, I think I got scared. I saw what I'd turn into. I saw a sensible life ahead, with no risks or surprises. So I broke it off. These pebbles are so uncomfortable. How do you do it? Sit on this. - You staying here? - Why? You want to go? Maybe I could make up some of my losses. Just suppose I won 100,000. I'm not asking for much. With 100,000, I swear I'd walk away and go back to Paris. What do you think? What can I say? - Will you come along? - Not now. Maybe tonight. I'll be long gone. Now or tonight - it's all the same. All I have is one week paid at the hotel and 30,000 francs. Anyway, this display of flabby flesh makes me sick. I'd rather watch people gambling. Sure you won't come? We'll just watch. You'll lose your ticket money again. - I'm not crazy. - Then leave it with me. No, because I'm not coming back here. Good-bye. - Three. - Five thousand on 3. Red. Six, black, even, and manque. - Where are you going? - I lost my ticket money. Now leave me alone. - Excuse me. - Care to sit down? No, I'm just watching. I can't decide between 22 and 28. What do you think? Do you have a favorite number? - Yes, 17. - Really? - I assure you. - Take this. Go on. Play for me. - Seventeen. - Ten thousand on 17. You gamble often'? Sometimes. You won all this? Yes, luck's on my side. Seventeen, black, odd, manque. - But not on yours. - Sorry. Luck's always changing. Come have a drink on me. I'd love to. - Twenty thousand. - 1900s or 5900s'? 5,0003. - Twenty-three. - Ten thousand on 23. Sit down. He got the message. - You know him? You were having a good time. - What? Forget it. - Twenty-three, red, odd, and passe. - I won! 350,000 for 10,000 francs. You brought my luck back. - Slut. - What? I said “slut.” - Don't make a jealous scene. - You're like a cheap hooker. - Thirty-two - - No, don't. First dozen, and straight 8 or square bet. Eight. 300,000 on black. - Eight. - I didn't know you were a hustler. - He gave me a chip. For a chip you'd walk the streets. Be quiet! Eight, black, even, manque. Don't look so glum. Smile. Smile or I'm changing tables. You won't smile? No, stay. Forgive me. First or third dozen? The first dozen again, 6 and black. - Twenty thousand on 6. - Six. 200,000 on black. Black. Six, black, even, manque. For the staff. Red and 1. Red and 1. For the staff. Thirteen. Thirteen. One... two... three... four million and 200,000. Thank you. Good thing I have my suitcase or I'd never manage. It's crazy. When you think everything's lost, it all works out. - My suitcase! - Right here. I was scared for a minute! I absolutely must go to Monte Carlo. - When? - Now. It's 3:00, right? - 4:10. Mine stopped. I left my jewels in Monte Carlo. That's a whole story. I sold them - for a pittance, of course, but I had no choice. I owed the casino a lot, and at times like that, you'll do anything. Maybe I can get them back now. Especially a pair of pretty diamond earrings. I had a necklace too, but I never wore it anyway. What? - You amuse me. Did I say something silly? You know Monte Carlo? You have to come! One of the finest casinos in the world. - I know. - So you'll come? - If you like. I have no evening dress. It's optional, but it's more chic. And you'd need a tuxedo. We'll live the high life. You'll see. You know the Hétel de Paris? Of course not, since you've never been there. You're quiet. - You talk nonstop. Because I'm happy. It makes me... versatile. No, voluble. Is that the word? Ah, the H6tel de Paris! There's no finer hotel. And there's no point staying here. - We can leave right away. - Lt'd be nice to have a car. - I knew it. - What do you mean? Listen: If you buy the car, I'll pay for the hotel. That's fair. - It's fair. You can find some very nice used cars here. Just what we need. - It's 1,200,000. - So what? - A room for two. - Darling, get a suite. With a terrace, if possible. We'll be more comfortable. Look, Jean. It's marvelous. I'm so happy- - Coffee. - Madame? Nothing, thank you. This one or this one? - That one. - Really? You asked my opinion. Yes, you're right. I should have gone to get my jewels. I'll go tomorrow. You like this luxury? What luxury? Here? What you call the high life. Yes and no. It amuses me sometimes. But I don't mind not having it. Yet you gamble to make money. Not at all. I don't like money. You see what I do with it when I have it. If I loved money, I wouldn't squander it. What I love about gambling is this idiotic life of luxury and poverty. And also the mystery - the mystery of numbers and chance. I've often wondered whether God rules over numbers. Perhaps you don't believe in God. So you've never wondered that. - Never. The first time I walked into a casino, I felt like I was in church. I felt the same emotion. Don't laugh. Try to understand. - I'm not laughing. I'm explaining how gambling is my religion, and you snigger. Money means nothing to me. Neither does this dress or this room. But that's probably beyond you. A single chip makes me happy. All the rest - - And the others? - Who? Your husband, your friends? I don't owe anyone anything. Why deny myself this passion? In whose name? I'm free! Let me go! I don't need your pity. I deserve nothing. What am I to you? Am I nothing more than an object to you? Don't you have a heart? Look at me, damn it! Don't ever do that again. You have no rights over me. None. We're partners in a game. Let's leave it at that. Forgive me. I don't want there to be any misunderstandings. We mustn't mix our feelings with a situation that's hard enough already - at least for me. Then why are we in this room together? Why are we staying together? Well? - I don't want to hurt you. - A little late for that. I thought you understood. Well? Answer me! You're hurting me. Well? You want to know? Why I drag you around with me like a dog? You bring me luck, like a lucky horseshoe. Forgive me! What did you bet on? Thirty-three and black. Nine, red, odd, manque. See? When you're not here, I have no luck. Try the first dozen again. - Three's only came up once. - Try it, if you like. - Three. - Twenty thousand on 3. - Three. - Ten thousand on three. Thirteen, black, odd, manque. Change this for me. 600,000. Plaques of 100,000? 10,0008, 50,0008, and 100,0003. Let's change tables. This croupier has the evil eye. Seventeen-nineteen. Odd. - What did you pick? - Two and black. Twelve, red, even, manque. - Let's go. - We have to win tonight. I'll put all I've got left on 5. - Eight has a good chance. - Why? I don't know why, but I feel 8 will come up. Eight. Black. Five, red, odd, manque. Let's go. - Nothing left? - No. You? - Five thousand. Should I play it? - No! Come on. - I lost 900,000 francs. - I lost 700,000. That's 1,600,000 between us. - We should have left when I said. - I was sure eight would come up. Fournier! I never expected to see you here. Caron, a friend. Jackie. - A pleasure. When did you get in? - Today. I'm at the Carlton in Cannes. It's so good to see you! Just a minute. I won two million at Cannes. I hope to double it here. You caught the bug, you rascal! How's your luck? I won a lot yesterday, a bit less today. - How much? - Almost 3,000,000. Wow! Congratulations. So long. Bye, miss. Look me up. Wait for me! - How much you got left? - A thousand francs. Can I have another scotch? Just one. Waiter, a scotch. Forget it. Money! What's money, after all? I'm sorry now. - About what? If I'd bought back my jewels, I could have sold them tomorrow. We'll have to sell the car to pay for the hotel. Why not? - I took precautions. Lend me 100 francs. What precautions? I left 100,000 francs at the hotel. You're wonderful! You really think of everything. Lend rne another 100 francs. Money for another scotch, darling. We'll go back to Nice tomorrow. The Bay of Angels brings us luck. Same room? Yes, if possible. - Room 18? - Right. It feels like ages since we left this room. The Sioux is still there. I've been had. You knew I kept it to pay for the hotel. Why didn't you tell me? I'd have given it to you. - That's not true. I wouldn't have had to sell the car. The guy saw I needed money. What you did doesn't have a pretty name. - Meaning? - It's called theft. Oh, please! We won that money together. And I wanted to surprise you and win a pile. Nice surprise. Now we're broke. - How much have you got? - 360,000. - Then we're fine! We can win millions. - What if we lose? - We'll cheat. - Have you cheated before? Yes. Twice at Enghien, but they spotted me right away. I don't know. I could make eyes at the croupier. It'd be easier than forging chips or bills. But croupiers are incorruptible. They can't cheat anyway. - How do you know? - Try it and see. I'm ready. - You're serious? - You afraid? Yes. Of ending up like you. I'm waiting. I swear this is the last time I'll gamble. - Even if you win big? - Even if I win millions. - What's gotten into you? - That's just how it is. Place your bets. Croupier, 26. Ten thousand on 26. I think I'll be lucky. The third dozen, croupier. Twenty thousand on the third dozen. I think it's working. No more bets. Ten, black, even, manque. - I don't think it's working. - Too bad. Place your bets. Third dozen? Thirty and 32. And red. - You surprise me. - Do as you like. Sixty thousand on 4-8, square bet. Sixty thousand on 4-8, square bet. - That's stupid. - Charming! No more bets. He's not even looking at you. Thirty-five, black, odd, passe. - That all you've got left? - Yes. I'm out. - Do I bet it or not? - Bet it. - You have money left? - Ten thousand at the hotel. It's your fault. - Why? You trusted the croupier too much. I'll play 17. My lucky number. Twelve, red, even, manque. We can't do much with 10,000. - One person could help us. - Who? - Caron. - Who? - The guy I ran into at Monte Carlo. - Oh, the tall guy. I'll call the Carlton. - The Carlton in Cannes. - You know the number? I'm going up to rest. Hello? The Carlton? No, I'll hold. Mr. Caron. Caron checked out this morning. - Where'd he go? - He didn't leave an address. What's wrong? - I have a headache. Can't you ask Marijo? If you knew how she treated me last time! I'll never ask her again. I refuse to see her. You said she owed you money. She did once. Now I owe her. So you lied! Don't shout! I feel awful. What about your husband? He refuses to give me anything. He's rich, it's true, but I'd rather beg than ask him. So you lied when you said he'd help you? Yes. Why? I don't know. Are you crying? It's nothing. Sometimes I feel ashamed. I feel rotten inside. I fight it, but the rottenness spreads everywhere. I lie. I let others down. I dirty everything I touch. - That's not true. What are we going to do? I'll write to my father. We parted in anger, but if I send him a nice letter, he'll soften. I'll admit I was wrong. I'll say, “Dear Dad, our quarrel grieved me very much. Forgive me for all the pain I caused you.” See? I'm no better than you. I have something for you from the post office. It's for a money order. It needs a signature, and I couldn't sign for you. There's a letter too. - Good news! - What? - My father sent money. - I'm happy for you. You bought fruit? What nice peaches! And olives, apricots, and grapes. You're an angel. We can take the night train back to Paris tomorrow. That's sweet, but I'm not going back to Paris with you. - This morning you said - - I changed my mind. - Why? - It's not easy, you know. Sure, we could live together and be happy for a while. But what for? I'd never stop gambling. It would start all over. So what's the use? Let's part on good terms. Let's spare ourselves pointless suffering, emotional scenes, harsh words, and a lot of grief. I love you. I know. Do you love me? Yes, Jean... but not the same way. But I need you, and I can help. We'll get through this together. We'll be happy. I'd love to believe you. I mean, it's a lovely idea, but it's impossible. I know myself. It's too late. What's that mean? You sound like a novel. Call it what you like. For the last time, please think it over. - Where are you going? - To the post office. Are you mad at me? A little, yes. “I'm sending you 50,000 francs. Come home any time you like, no questions asked.” Have you seen Madame Demaistre? She left right after you. She'll be back. She left her bag. Did she say where she went? I don't follow my guests' comings and goings. - You could have left a note. - I was in a hurry. Twenty-three. Second dozen. - I'm going back to Paris. - I'm not stopping you. - You had no money left. - My watch. Care to bet? - Come with me. - No, Jean. You'll never break free. Come on. Come with me. You're making me lose. Go away.
