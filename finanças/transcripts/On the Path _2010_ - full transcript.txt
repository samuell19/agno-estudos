Roll with it, roll with it To be good, to be nice To be daddy's son Just to have tons of money and a fast car. I don't need a job, I don't need a goal, I just don't care, I need none of it, Blam, blam, I dream of autobahn But all my roads are just macadam Blam, blam, I can't take anymore! Passengers, please listen carefully as the flight attendant demonstrates our safety features. Insert the metal fittings to fasten your seat belt. Keep your seat belt fastened throughout the flight. This aircraft is equipped with four emergency exits, two in the front of the plane and two in the back. Please take a moment to locate your nearest exit. Lights on the floor lead to the exits. A safety-information card is in the seatback in front of you. Enjoy your flight... Is the phone line down again? I guess someone forgot to pay the bill. I'll pay tomorrow! Tomorrow! Hey, flush the toilet. It stinks. Roll with it, roll with it ON THE PATH Dejo, is Amar with you? Is Amar with you?! Luna, I love you. I love you! Listen... For the woman I love! This one is for you! This is my house, I used to live here This is my dear love, I used to love her, That's the man that took everything from me Bums wait for me, I have nowhere to go What the fuck is this? That's my mug. You're screwed. The disciplinary board has initiated this procedure. You are suspended for six months. You are required to undergo therapy. If successful, you can return to work, but not at the same job. This has been a severe violation of discipline and passenger safety. I'm truly sorry, Amar. When I was a child, I dreamt of being a pilot. Tell me how could you be so stupid. I messed up. You don't care about what the doctor said. Yes, I care. Yeah right. Luna, I do care. You have no idea how much. I messed up. So, what do we do now? Wait here. Why aren't you eating? I can't go back there. Luna honey, they are all crazy. You have no idea. If I go back there, I'll go mad. You have to go, Amar. Everything will be fine. Let's go! I haven't finished. Check, please! Forty, sir. Paddle! Blam, blam, I dream of autobahn But all my roads are just macadam Blam, blam, I can't take anymore! The worst thing for me is to walk into a dirty public toilet. I hate cleaning after other people. Why would you clean it? What would the next person think about me? Who cares! Me, too. What? I would clean it, too. I can't do anything if it isn't clean. You two are made for each other. One cleans the toilet before and the other after. I clean it before and after. And I don't clean at all! Really? Yeah. Sorry. It's my fault. You weren't watching. We were talking. Are you hurt? How's your wife? You could have killed us. It's no big deal, buddy. Amar... Don't you recognize me? No. Bahrija. Bahrija!? Wow! - I thought you looked familiar. - Really? How are you? Fine... Luckily, still alive. I am so glad I ran into you. Not about the crash, but... Unbelievable. Luna, this is Bahrija. Nice to meet you. Forgive me, I don't shake hands with women. Sejla and Dejan. Hi. Hello. Unbelievable meeting like this! But not a coincidence. You know what they say: What has passed you by was not meant to befall you. Let's go have a drink. We'll discuss your car. I can't, I'm in a hurry. - You live in Sarajevo? - Yes Working? At the airport. Really? Masha'Allah! I'll call you. What distracted you? I'll show you what... Hadzic. Room 216. Here... This might help. Close your eyes and concentrate. The results are not good. There are very few mobile sperm. So this makes it more difficult to impregnate your wife. So what do we do now? You have plenty of time. We've been trying for two years. There is always the possibility of artificial insemination. It's a routine procedure. Just let me know and we can schedule. We could start after your next period. Live healthy... Walk a lot, eat fruits and vegetables. No alcohol or cigarettes. Everything will be fine. Be optimistic! Who still cracks their own walnuts, Grandma? My Ruzica cakes would not taste right if I used store-boughtjunk. You can't make ruzica without good walnuts. And Eid isn't the same without my Ruzica cakes. But it's a long time till Eid! If only we were in Bijeljina, like before... We could all gather in our garden for Eid. Where is Grandpa? In hell. That lucky bastard can still walk. He stuck by my side like a dog his whole life. I told him to go out and enjoy life and let me alone. But no! He just sat around. My beautiful Luna! She always visits Grandma. Others... they behave like bastards. May Allah give you all the best. There's Sejla on TV, turn it up. I really like her shows. Children bind a man to his wife. What? Nothing. I'm just thinking. I wish I'd had more children, not just your mother. God rest her soul. My dear child. Come on, grandma, get up. Let's go for a drink. I'll have a coffee. And you? Double herb brandy. We don't serve alcohol. So then coffee. Two coffees and water. Brandy? At 10 am? For an upset stomach. No smoking here. What kind of place did you bring me to? You're very nervous. See anyone from our platoon? Necko, Deba, Miraj... We go to the same mosque. Miraj in a mosque? Yes. Why? And you? Nobody. I didn't want to see anyone after the war ended. But now I'm glad to see you. I'm going out for a smoke. Five years after the war, no job, no money, nothing! Falling apart, can't get myself together. I wanted to end it all. Nothing made any sense. Suddenly clouds appeared on a sunny day. Rain, hail, and nowhere to hide. I ran down the street, looking for shelter under a canopy. I passed this mosque. A man stood outside. He made me nervous, the way he looked at me. Then he smiled and asked me to come inside. "It will warm your body and soul. " It sounded weird, but I went inside anyway. Then, I don't know... Itjust hit me. Salaam Alaykum. You want some candy? What are we celebrating? I got a job. What's the job? - Teaching computers to kids. - Yeah? Only till my suspension ends. Where? Lake Jablanica. Bahrija set it up. Bahrija? Bahrija the Wahhabi? Yeah. What are you doing with him? Nothing. I met with him. He needs someone who knows computers. The pay is excellent. We can find something else. Luna, sweetie... But they're... The wife looks like a ninja. I thought she would pull out a sword. I don't care what they're like. It's not my business. What's wrong? I don't want you to go. That's all. I'll only hug trees. I don't want you to. Lake Jablanica, swimming... Computers, games. I can rest. When are you going? No way. No, no... No way! You're not going anywhere. I won't let you. I'll be back in a few days... I love you. How are you? Thank you. The customer is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. Yes... OK... Fine. Thank you. Why hasn't Amar called me? Fine... Goodbye. What did she say? Tomorrow at six. Don't go. It's clear something isn't right. Why all the secrecy? You saw that Bahrija character. A Wahhabi. You know what they do? He's an Army friend. Even if he was his brother! It's probably a terrorist camp! The children and computers must be a cover-up. Didn't a Wahhabi kill an entire family recently? Around Christmas at Jablanica! Amar is an idiot. No, not my Amar! They brainwash people. They recruit people with money or sweet talk. What's your problem? It's always something. It's always about him. The rest of us are never entitled to have problems. Only Amar can have hard times. Only Amar was in the war. Was it a party for us others? Salaam alayki. I'm Nadja. - I'm Luna. Please, don't use your cell phone. Remove the battery. They listen in on us. Who? Don't worry, sister. We're not what they say we are. Salaam Alayki. Wa Alayki as-salaam, sister. Salaam Alayki. I can do it, thanks. How's Sarajevo? Very hot. Here, it's pleasant. Pleasant... Except for mosquitoes. I brought some creams. May Allah reward you. Where's Amar? You'll see him tonight. I'd like to see him now. He's working. You'll see him tonight. Salaam Alayki. Salaam. You can rest here. The washroom and toilet are behind the tent. Relax, sister. This is the best place for rest. Tomorrow, you'll feel brand new. May Allah reward you for your presence here. There's no signal here. Are you the new one from Sarajevo? No, I'm not. I'm just visiting. Need something, sister? Let's go, sister. Put this on. Go on. Praise be to Allah, blessed be His prophet, Mohammed... Our souls and our deeds determine our status, and that which is waiting for us in the other, eternal world. So, dear brothers and sisters, when you ask a true believer what is the purpose of his life, he will tell you: I live to earn Allah's mercy, to go to Paradise and enjoy its riches. That is the ultimate goal and hope of every believer. That ultimate result is truly final, definite, and eternal. Heaven is surrounded by unpleasant obstacles, while Hell is surrounded by lust and pleasure. The path to Heaven is full of thorns, suffering, hardship... On the contrary, it takes little effort to attain Hell. It's enough to only... Be careful. Careful Let's go. Sejla says this is a terrorist camp. Forget Sejla. People come here to rest, learn, socialize... Trust me. You'll see. You'll see how life can be beautiful and simple. But they're strange. As you are strange to them. - Come on! Let's go home, please. I'm working here. Fuck thatjob, there are otherjobs. Don't swear. This place has something. Some kind of peace. I sleep like a baby. I don't drink. Really, there is purity here, among the brothers. Brothers? That's how they call each other. That's how you just called them. Luna, let's not argue tonight. Sister! What do you think you're doing? You can't go further. The brothers can see you. Go back to the camp. Allah have mercy, go back! You're not allowed. Go with the sisters. Go! I want to go home! You can come with me this afternoon. I want to leave now. The barge is not here. Where's Amar? He has classes. He sends his salaams. Send him my salaams. Tell him to come back home now. Fine. Peace be with you. My Bahrija organized all this. He is compassionate about orphans. He accepted me with three children. I'm a widow. My husband was killed in the war. I'm so sorry. You have no children? No. Children are the greatestjoy. Every Muslim woman's duty is to bear children. Too many of us were killed in the war. We need the most children possible. Western women are slaves to their careers. They refuse children. Or they let others care for their children. All those divorces and drug addicts... Terrible! The West is killing femininity in women. That idiot driver! We'll find him work here, with me. Why thatjob? I don't know. Hey, what's new? Not much. You? Maybe he's got delirium tremens. Then you should be Osama bin Laden! Very funny. Up yours! Shut up! Don't talk to me. Guys, enough! I'll go get him. You won't have to. He can't last much longer. What? Sorry. The uterus is normal. The sonogram shows the ovaries are also normal. We can start with the injections. You shouldn't miss any. Continue with them, even when you travel. Next week, come for a follicle checkup. In two weeks, we can start the artificial insemination process. Your partner needs to come with you. Thank you. I'm too scared to watch. You'll soon be doing this yourself. Never. I'd like to see our old house before I die. Why don't you go see it? Why don't you? I don't want to see the bastards who took it from me. You sold the house. It was not taken from you. It was first taken. Then I had to sell it. What could I do? Stay in Bijelina and watch those who killed my daughter walk free? My roses must be in full bloom now. They must have cut them too. How is Amar? Fine. May Allah give him all the best. See what the heart knows: blossoms appear Flowers scent as they touch the ground Rains bathe Bosnia, the colorful garden Blossoms perfume the break of dawn Rains bathe Bosnia, the colorful garden Blossoms perfume the break of dawn Thank you for bringing me. I'm happy you're pleased. Emir, this man was the best soldier in our unit during the war. Masha'Allah. His late brother was a real hero. I would prefer to still have a brother than a dead hero. We need good soldiers. For peace in Bosnia. Luna! This wild man look... Your beard tickles! People are watching. Let's go. Blessed Eid! Happy Bayram, my dear child. Blessed Eid to you. Grandpa! Grandpa's darling! How are you? Not so good, thank God! Blessed Eid! How are you? You sure have grown. Blessed Eid! Happy Bayram! Something for you. How are you? So cute! Any news? Nothing. I'll let you know. I know about an imam. He cures hexes, infertility. Just like that. Blessed Eid! You want his number? No, thanks. Happy Bayram! Amar, Blessed Eid! Blessed Eid to you. My name is Al-Muharem, from the tribe of old Azras, who sacrifice their life for love and die for a kiss... who sacrifice their life for love and die for a kiss... When God took my manhood, why didn't He also take my sight, to not see such beauties? What's wrong? I'm celebrating Eid. Drop dead, you fool. Greater Eid is near. Will there be a sacrificial slaughter? Yes, myself! Only in Bosnia do Muslims celebrate Eid with brandy. We mixed everything up during Communist times. God loves joyful events. This is a sin. We say we're Muslims, but we ignore the customs of our true faith. - Bullshit! Genocide was brought upon us because we are infidels. We now celebrate Eid in the homes of strangers. Why? Why aren't you in Bijeljina? You don't dare go. You let them kill and expel you. Allah tested us. He tests us still. You want another war? Amar! It's our fault, we, who don't hear Allah. The slaughtered are our fault! There will be more, if we don't find our true faith! Shut up! Don't you lecture me on how to celebrate Eid nor tell me what is a good Muslim. My husband drinks as he wants. Allah knows his good deeds. If you don't like it, get out! I'm the only one who preaches here. Not imam, nor Reis. Understood? Amar! Wait! Are you crazy? Have you no shame? Why ashamed? You're now a religious expert? You used to vomit from drink at Grandma's house. Now you preach? You learned this new arrogance from your brothers? That's enough! It sure is! Has Amar gone mad? Allah is the greatest! Surely Allah hears whoever praises Him! Allah is the greatest! Allah is the greatest! Peace be unto you and the blessings of Allah! Peace be unto you and the blessings of Allah! I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the outcast. In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. The Most Beneficient who has taught you the Qur'?n. He created man. He taught him eloquent speech. The sun and the moon run on their fixed courses exactly calculated. And the herbs and the trees both prostrate. And the heaven He has raised high, and He has set up the balance. In order that you may not transgress due balance. And observe the weight with equity and do not make the balance deficient. And the earth He has put for the creatures. Therein are fruits, date-palms producing sheathed fruit-stalks. And also corn, with its leaves and stalk for fodder, and sweet-scented plants. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny? He created man from sounding clay like the clay of pottery. And the jinns did He create from a smokeless flame of fire. Don't leave those ugly hairs on the sink. What? I love you. I love you too. Not tonight. We should have an Islamic wedding. Artificial insemination is recommended only for married couples. I'm just saying what would be best for us and the baby. May I ask when did you start praying? A couple of days ago. So now you're a believer? Yes. Thanks for informing me. Why are you so negative? I'll be positive. When can we talk? We are talking. Everything's fine. I love you. You love me. We should get married. We're Muslims, so we should have an Islamic wedding. This is all a result of that camp, right? No. There was always something. Now, I know how I feel. What's wrong? I'm trying to understand. Nothing's changed. I just want to be a better man. Hook my bra, please. Why don't you come for a while? - I can't. Making me go alone again? I can't cancel. Dejo wants to see you. He calls, but you don't answer. Where are you going? Something at the mosque. This is an excellent book. It's about the Prophet and... When was the last time we made love? The Prophet declares... I declare that we make love. We never fuck anymore. Read that book, and you'll realize why sexual intercourse before marriage is not recommended. What? That's my opinion. The book... Listen to what you're saying. It's a sin. Maybe that's why you can't get pregnant. You're kidding, right? Is this some kind of joke? I'm serious. Fine. That dress is unsuitable. Really? No sex before marriage... Back to being a virgin? Dismiss our relationship so far? You always avoid discussing things seriously. What is your fucking problem? The Prophet, peace be upon him, states that the best among you are those who treat their wives well. Another hadith gives a description of a good wife. According to the Prophet, the best wife makes her husband happy when she looks up to him. She is obedient... She defends his property and his honor. She makes no objections, no wrong moves. If we want to be among the blessed, we obey the Prophet's words. Sister, sit down. Dear brother Bahrija, declare your intent to marry sister Dija by uttering the words "I marry you". I marry you. I marry you... Sister Dija, do you accept to be brother Bahrija's wife? I accept. I accept... May Allah's mercy be upon you. Be united in good. Amen! Amen! Luna! What? What? You don't understand. - I can't believe it. They agree, Nadja agrees. It's not a sin. It's illegal! Bahrija will pay for her education. She has no family. Our country's laws forbid it! God's laws are stronger. Are you crazy? Two wives! She is a minor! You don't understand. I can't believe this! I can't. I'm going back inside. Go back to the hole you crawled out from! Where is that idiot? Ask him yourself. He took me to a mosque. To a mosque? There are bonus points for converting Christians. Luna, he's totally crazy. He stopped drinking. Why can't my wife defend me like you defend Amar? He's expressing his religious feeling. He finds solace in God. Why consider him crazy? Is he hurting anyone? Please don't. Didn't she say Amar's friends would perform some terrorist act? Exploring your spiritual side would do you some good! You don't have a leg to stand on. Oh, I have something to stand on. Stop it, you two! Amar! Want a drink? No thanks. Some rose juice? Nothing. I'm here to pick up Luna. It's late for her to walk the streets alone. I'm not ready yet. Then I'll wait for you outside. No need. I'll be here for a while. Just stay here! Why wait outside? He can't stay in this sinful place! Music is a sin. Alcohol is a sin. Strapless dresses are a sin! Don't. - It's true. Amar, what else is a sin? Are high heels a sin? Makeup? Nail polish? Eating with the left hand is a sin. What do your books say? Sex before marriage is a sin! Women speaking out is a sin! Laughter is a sin, right? Go back to your idiots! They are not idiots. Let's go home. I don't want to! I've had enough! You're a big bore! Amar! You look the same as when you moved into our building. I envied you. Everyone always looking after you, caring for you. Luna, the refugee. When we did that play for the mothers on March 8, you sat on the stairwell crying. I begged God to drop a bomb on my family, so I could sit and cry like you. Then everyone would be at my side sighing. You're not normal. "Luna, Luna, where's your cherry?" All the boys were in love with you. Come on! They all had the hots for you. You were the first girl to get tits. Yeah, the older guys liked me. Remember that 9th floor neighbor? He used to check out my legs while distributing humanitarian aid cans. I ran up the stairs in mini-skirts and he always brought me more. Why remember that now? What's wrong with her? This is her house. It's my house. Your house? I live here. I used to live here. Why did you leave? Amar, what happened to us? Do you love me? That's not important to you anymore. Yes, it is. Hadzic. Lipnicevic. Hello. How are you? Are you ready? That room. Sir, please follow me. Luna, lie on the bed. Move back a bit, please. Everything's going to be fine. Relax. I'll perform a check-up, followed by a puncture. That's it. Please spread your legs a bit more. I can't. I'm sorry. Amar, I can't. What do you mean? I'm sorry but I can't. Luna, what's wrong? I don't want your child. I don't want any child. Luna... My beautiful girl. What happened? You're right. Allah wanted you to not conceive in sin. When my dad was taken, I prayed for God's help. I begged Him to bring my mom back. They were killed in front of our house, like dogs. They're in Heaven, like my parents. I'm Amar. Should I call Amar? What's the problem? She fainted. Alcohol? No. Headache? Sickness? When was your last period? It can't be that. Nurse, a pregnancy test... Just lie back. You want to go home? Let's go to my place. - 43 Zaima Sarca Street. It can't be. It can. It's impossible. The doctor was also confused. But it's true. I don't know if I'll keep the baby. What? Luna, I love you. What else matters? Let's go home. That's not possible. Goodbye, Amar. Luna, come back. You come back to me.
