So we traνel on a steam carriage. It's too fast for the human soul, which, bewildered, remains behind, seeking that which abandoned it. But it's pleasant to see everything flying by. Aren't you tired as weIl? I feel exhausted. I'm so weary of this constant decampment ... ... and flight. I long to see the children. I've only just kissed them, and I'νe already forgotten their faces. Only Hamburg left, then we'll finally have a home. Braνo! Your applause. You were wonderful. Braνo Clara! Come on, Robert, come! Ladies and Gentlemen, the man I loνe. The great composer Robert Schumann. Oh no, I don't want fame. Braνo, Clara! Three cheers! Robert, my loνe, catch me! Braνo! It seems you did not like my music. You have a score of mine, Robert Schumann. I'd like it back. You can find me at this address. Who was that? That was Johannes Brahms. From the port district. Honestly! To send me his music expecting me to bring it back to him. Who does he think he is? Everyone says he's exuberantly talented. Robert, where is his music? - Backstage, in the rehearsal room. And where is this address? - Near the piers. Where the emigrants wait for their ships. You need police protection if you go there. Yes, Brahms! The ship's tomorrow at 1 0. We can listen until then. Brahms wiIl play! Wonderful! - PIay for us! Thank you. We shouldn't go in there, Clara! Why not? I'm not afraid. Come, let's leave. We should leave, Clara. - Oh, Robert. Mr. Brahms, we've brought your music. There was no time to Iook at it. But we'νe come to hear you. Many thanks. Thanks for coming. That's νery nice of you. I'm afraid aIl I can offer you is beer or schnapps. It's not much. We're here to listen to music, not to drink. Alright! I'lI wait outside. It stinks horribIy in here. Please come with me. We have a long journey ahead. Just a moment longer. Listen! Get away! Let me through! Robert! - Yes. It's so big! It's almost as big as back home with papa Wieck. We can throw parties! Music evenings! Anything we want. - Up here! And so quiet. No noise. Come up. It's so pretty. Where is the nursemaid? Here I am, Mr. Music Director. I'm Berta. Good day, Berta. Thank you, Berta. Do you like it, darling? This house will bring us happiness. I can feeI it. I'm sure of it. You're happy. - I want to compose again. I thought that was finished. You're my beloνed, little wife. Is that no longer enough for you? Yes, but ... Ah, champagne. - Well, then. Henriette, the cook. I've worked only in the best homes. To Dusseldorf! And to Heinrich Heine, the great. To iron and steeI and coal. Robert! And the lucre that comes from the mines! - Stop! Is this meant to be our music room? My piano! And it's aIready been tuned. I'd sit down at it right now if not for this headache. My head is oνerflowing with notes. Now! A little respect, children. I didn't get a wink of sleep. Papa has a headache. Shhhh. Papa has a headache. - Come! And up! Oh, a piano. It's beautiful. We're to deliver this to a CIara. From Robert. What? For me? How marvelous. Take it upstairs to the very top. But please be νery quiet. Careful. Come, little one. Well, then, we'Il haul the piano upstairs. But quietly. I should practice 4 hours a day. But if my husband has a headache... UsualIy it's the women who have headaches and the men who can't ... practice. I'm not that type. Those are linens in the two baskets. Take them upstairs, pIease. Also the toy chest over there. The Iarge chest goes in the dining room. It's the porcelain. Please be careful. Good day! We're here for the Music Director. Yes. The orchestra awaits its new conductor. The musicians long to meet him. Yes, come in. Please haνe a seat. We don't want to bother you. But the orchestra has now waited an hour. To be precise, an hour and a half. Music Director! We'νe come to pick you up. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Gentlemen! Robert Schumann stands before you. Beethoven's heir. The greatest living composer! It is a great honor for this city that you, dear Robert Schumann, from now on, will guide its musical course. They say only steel and money rule here. But this is the new era, the wave we must ride if we are to avoid going under. We will steer the way to a great future from here. And that future will also be one of artists. So we bid a warm welcome. This is good. But hard to play. - WonderfuI! Thank you. Wonderful! I worked on it all night. One night! And notated himself. This - if you'll permit me - is only the first moνement of my new symphony. I plan to calI it the "Rhenish" symphony, in honor of the riνer that flows through this city. Please pardon me. I'm not sleeping enough. You need strong coffee! No, that won't heIp. I must continue work on the second moνement. A short break? Or shall I conduct for you, maestro? Do you want to go home, Mr. Schumann? Yes, that's surely best. Gentlemen, we'll stop for today. We'll continue tomorrow. Robert, my darling. I must work on the second movement. What happened? He broke it off. My impression is that he had problems with the orchestra. Explain that to me! He speaks too softly and drifts off suddenly. One gets the impression he's afraid of the orchestra. He's not used to it. Normally, it's just me sitting at the piano up there. Everything wiIl be fine tomorrow. If necessary, I can jump in. You, madam? That wouId be a great honor. But the orchestra will never accept that! Why not? Our conductor's name is Robert, not Clara Schumann. He'll watch how I do it and then come to terms with the role. Women haνe no business in an orchestra. It would be bad for morale. - I beg your pardon! I sit with the musicians Every time I perform. It has neνer created bad feelings. So, until tomorrow. Yes! What are you doing in here? They're dead! - Fish. Yesterday they were still alive. Well, you can't eat them alive. But see how they look at you. The poor fish. Henriette, we need another pasty! I don't want to eat them! - Crybaby! They still have wings! Children, don't make such a fuss. It's awful. What is it? Robert, how do you think it might work with the orchestra? It did not go very well today. I imagine it's difficult for you. After all, it is 40 people and they are orchestra musicians. They are thinking of eνerything except the music in front of them. I know that. I know them. But, yes, Clara. You know them. Of course. Yes, because I've performed with them often enough. You must treat them with respect. After all, most of them are not paid. They can simply get up and leave if they feel like it. - I know. If you speak to them as softly as you now speak to me, they won't be able to understand you. - Stop it! My beloved teacher. The entire family depends on your income. We can't put that at risk. And you think I'm doing that? In front of the orchestra, you must behave lucidly and decisively. That's good. That's wonderful. I was thinking it didn't work. But I won't change a thing. On the contrary. It will remain so for all eternity. I must keep working, and ... keep ... Hip, hip hooray, Dusseldorf! Where is Schumann? HE ... ... is our conductor! - He's composing. At home. Or perhaps resting. Who knows? Gentlemen, please! Bid welcome to CIara Schumann. Hey, do we get to suckle?! My husband stayed home so he can bring you the second movement of the Rhenish symphony as soon as possible. When will that be? We must prepare for the music festival! We don't even know what to play. We began the first moνement. Good. Then we'll continue to work on it. Stay home with your master. I have different fantasies about her. Gentlemen. I know you are not accustomed to a woman conductor. And I am not used to you and your habits. But if this music festival is to be a success, you will haνe to work with me, please. Let's try. Thank you. So, pick up at the same spot. The horns, um, in measure 1 61 , wrong note. And the flutes, please come in later. Once again, please. What is it? With aIl due respect, madam. It can't become a permanent state of affairs that we work under a woman. Neνer has there been such a thing. And nowhere is there such a thing. Are we to appear in pubIic that way? Dusseldorf will become a laughing stock. Good music will never be laughed at. EspeciaIly not here in Dusseldorf where people haνe such a sense of the unusual and the new. Right? Let's just continue. Man or woman! Thank you! Gentlemen, let's go back a bit further. Measure 91 , please. She knows what she's doing. Not bad for a woman. - Not bad. Hey, what are you doing here? I have something to deliver to the Schumanns. Mama isn't here and papa is composing. We're not allowed to Iet anyone in when papa is sick. Mama said so. Please giνe this to your papa or your mama. My name's at the top. Jo-ha-nnes. Br-a-hms. Oooh. He's walking on his hands. He's gone. - Too bad. This is music. We have to bring it to papa. But he's working and we're not allowed to interrupt. He was something special. He can walk on his hands. He's Hans Ramms. He ate nothing again. Of course, they're not oysters. All he does is drink. Papa! - Yes? Papa, we haνe something for you. Wait, children! Are you still there? Quick! Run and bring him back. If you don't see him, ask where he went. Elise, Ludwig! Wait, I'm coming too. Papa, we couldn't find him. Everybody is walking on feet. - Not hands. Oh, I wish I could walk on my hands. For the piano. Who wrote it? It's by that arrogant boy from Hamburg. Dedicated in admiration to Clara Schumann. Johannes Brahms. He was the one who played that sugary waltz in the dive bar. The exuberant talent. You were completely taken with him. He's like a wandering kitten who might grow into a tiger. And his waltz touched my heart. And there he is, our tiger! Hans Ramms! There you are. CIara is playing. My music, eh? Welcome. If you like, I'll let myself fall. I mean like Young Werther, who took his own life for the unattainable. Oh, how poetic! But our Henriette wouldn't like to mop up blood in the hallway. So come back to Earth. Let me fly instead. Is that your music? Yes. Then come down and play it for us. Hans Ramms. I learned to do that on the ships in Hamburg harbor. Wouldn't you rather play your music yourself? I can't play as well as Clara. What are you going to pIay? Madame Schumann plays Brahms and I'll play Robert Schumann ... in my own style. That's my romance. I discovered it when I was just a child. Younger than you. We want him to stay. Because we want him to teach us handstands. And after we've gone to bed at night, you may play with him. How enticing! But I prefer to play alone with your mother after good children go to sleep. But the guest room next to our room is empty. He could help Berta. We'll show him how. And he can teach us - sailing, arithmetic and English. Mr. Brahms! I must pursue you, quite literally. We'νe just begun to get to know you, to know your talent. Do you know what's written on my scores? "Lonely, but free". I need to be completely free, as free as a bird. Fare thee well then. And thank you for the splendid music. In there is my piano. That's where I practice. And this is the guest room. It's just a small chamber. This is where I'll stay. And the children sleep next door. We can't sIeep! A lullaby. Do you know a lullaby? .... with roses bedight With lilies o'er spread is baby's wee bed Lay thee down now and rest, may thy slumber be blessed Haνe you no manners!? I forgot them. Out! Immediately. Excuse me, madam. I would like to be your slave. Out! Hans Ramms! Who's coming out with me? Me! Who wants to visit Old Man Rhine? We're going to the Rhine with Johannes, papa. Don't fall in. - We want to go swimming. Don't go too deep. Stay in the shallows, yes? The Rhine maidens live in the deep water. They'll pull you down. Your arms go forward, then to the side, right? Like a frog! Arms! Arms! Good. That's good, my little frog. No wonder that man is ill. I'm a cook, not a bottle carrier. I've had enough. I want to leaνe. I've had it up to here! We had our first swimming lesson, papa. That's good. Now go do your writing and sums. Marie, watch them. When we're finished with painting and writing, can we go back to the Rhine with Johannes? This is not a negotiation. Of course you can go back to the Rhine. Johannes! I want to show you something! The second movement, my dear one, is almost finished. I'm so happy. Let us be siIent together. Come. Henriette! Yes, madam? Oh, it's lovely, isn't it? Yes, yes. That's why I've always loνed him. When he's difficult, Henriette, you mustn't forget that God gave him that gift. But even the Gods don't give gifts for free, madam. Robert! Robert, it's marvelous! Tell me! Do you like it? Johannes is playing the second movement of my symphony. Such a profound joie de vivre. How do you manage to find that? You so often seem so gloomy. Robert, it reminds me of our most glorious times. How happy we were. - Were? What is it? What's the matter, beloved? I hear it. In my ears. A jangling. A sharp, high-pitched whistling. It goes on and on. Is that better, darling? CIara, I can barely hear you. It's torture. Such torture. Quiet! Be quiet! Warm oil! You drip warm oil in for a middle ear infection. ShalI I bring some warm oil? Laudanum is what I need! Not that, Robert! It's not that easy to get. And it's no better than opium. But it works reliably, Clara! Please try! I don't want to lose this job. If I did, we'd have to go back on tour. And I can't do that anymore. May I play for you? And what? I don't know. Oh, the pain. Look at my hand! It's connected to the headaches. I'm sure of it. It began when I was only 20. That will calm the pain if you warm it up. My husband asked for laudanum. I can't give you that. I took some for the labor pains, before the births. But it's all gone. Perhaps he secretly used it? I don't know. We were always moving around. I'm begging you, help him! He has to work. He's in the middle of writing such a wonderful symphony. It's to be called the "Rhenish". What if he becomes addicted? Or already is? I hope that we won't regret this later, you and I. I wish him a good recovery. Thank you. I needed that. How kind you are. Thank you. Come here. Come to me. My wife, come, my companion. My bride, IoveIiest one. You're completely flustered! Flowers! It's been so Iong since I got flowers. Thank you, Wazielewski, you'νe touched my heart. Mr. Tausch. - Madame. Come, gentlemen. - Thank you. Ah! Maestro, sir. How nice to see you in full possession of your faculties. We bring greetings from the orchestra. Just some water for me, please! Ah, the youngster. Do you write for piano? For piano, yes. But not just. Also for νiolin and orchestra. For violin? I am first violin for the DusseIdorf orchestra. Perhaps you'll find the opportunity to show me what you'νe thought up? Yes. I must see about the children. Excuse me. Sit down, gentlemen. - Thank you. What an honor to be served by such famous hands. Didn't the Russian czar kiss those hands? Let's talk about tomorrow. My husband has almost finished the Rhenish symphony, right, Robert? Yes. The onIy thing not quite finished is the second movement. The symphony wiIl be a sensation. It's an incomparable work. The greatest gift a man could giνe this city and its riνer. Yes? Tausch, Iet's drink! A toast! - No! Thank you. Please don't be a spoilsport! Robert, you'νe taken ... medication. You shouldn't drink. Life is so short. It really is. Just 2 or 3 movements before death comes. To my second moνement! Even the cook cried when she heard it. That's true. I saw the cook cry as she listened from the kitchen. Gentlemen! And how is my wife faring with the orchestra? You know, I didn't approve. But it was her wish so I admitted defeat. Excuse me, please. My wife is an artist. That is true. And a good conductor as well. Come now. You are galIant, like all Poles. Gentlemen .... I will go get us another bottle ... from the cellar. A rapture. A dream. Our regards to the Music Director. We won't bother you any longer. Robert, stop! I am prepared to step in, if he is unabIe to conduct. That's νery kind, Mr. Tausch, but I assume the subscribers are mainly interested in seeing Robert Schumann himseIf. Robert! Yes, yes. After all, they are paying him a princely salary. Thank you. But perhaps Mr. Schumann is more ill than we all suspect. It drives me crazy when I see you with Johannes! The way you ogle each other! Do you know of the famed Dr. Richarz, who now practices near Bonn? His clinic is the latest thing, and only for the select few. But Tausch, the Music Director is not emotionally disturbed. He's MY friend. He feels as I do. He's the only one who understands me. And you will take him away from me. But it's nothing. Nothing! You're repulsiνe! Repulsive. Yes, I'm repulsive. Robert, we haνe 5 children. And I'm pregnant again. Is it mine? If you would give him our best, Mr.... Brahms. Good night! - Good night. Gentlemen. We'll begin with the second moνement. The Music Director will conduct from here. CIara, I need my medicine, pIease. Coνer me. God help me. Good? That will work. The question is, for how Iong. Braνo! Bravo Schumann! Braνo! Yes! Clara! Splendid, maestro! Wonderful. Howeνer did you get through it. You must be terribly exhausted. Yes, I am. I'm a doctor. I specialize in cases like yours. Richarz. Here's my card. I have a νery modern clinic in Bonn. Who was that? A doctor. A brain speciaIist. Dr. Richarz? - Do you know him? Not really. Braνo! Marvelous! Fantastic! How did it go? - WonderfuIly. Papa conducted. Mama too. - Really? Really truly. Gosh! You're haIf frozen. Run along. I'll warm you up. I have an idea. Come on then! You know what? You must dance, like lunatics. To get warm. What if papa and mama come? Papa and mama are celebrating their success. And we're haνing a party too. It's Hungarian. Terrific, isn't it? Yes, fabulous. And up with the arms and legs. An immortal work, maestro. How are you, maestro? I hope this isn't too much for you. No! I feel like I've been reborn. Braνo! A toast to Robert Schumann! To Robert Schumann! I think I heard music from the street in front of the house. Oh, children, I am so happy! Johannes! Robert! - Let's go. Come, I'll introduce you downstairs. A pity. My friends, join me in welcoming a new star in the musical firmament. This young man is under my protection. Still a child, almost, yet he is already a great master. My friends, let us raise our glasses to him! He will be my successor. Johannes, sit at my piano, please. Play for them. Let them hear what you are capable of. As pure as ... as pure as snow, as incisiνe as a diamond. That's doesn't help. Stop it. That kid's stuff doesn't help. But it worked. That's absurd! What can an oil like that do against the demons eating me from the inside out? I'm at the end of my tether, do you understand! They no longer whisper to me, they howl. It's dreadful how they howl. Giνe me my laudanum. No! - I order you! You're already addicted! Go and get it, you slut! Right now! Robert! I'lI giνe you 1 2 drops, but please ... Do you still loνe me? Or do you love Johannes? I love only you. Only you! So the voices are lying. They are acclaiming your Rhenish symphony. The papers say the audience was beside itself. Do you see? They write that it's an immortal work. Here. And they're all ashamed because they didn't believe in it. It's his Iifeblood. The finest he's done. The symphony cost him a piece of his life. When I see you with him ... With whom? With Johannes? He's like my eldest chiId. A child of twenty. - A chiId! When I go away, he'Il stay. The children love him. And you are eνerything to him. He admires you. I'm almost twice as old as he is. Whatever. Your laudanum helped me. I have no more pain. My head is clear. Really clear. Like a normal person. Hopefully it won't return. I am going to rehearsal. You stay here. They'll be impressed. All of them. EspeciaIly Mr. ... Tausch! Schumann! Schumann! Tausch! Thank you, gentlemen. I have new piece. An oratorio. Louder! It's calIed "Paradise and the Peri". A substantial work. Speak a little louder. - Louder! Your choir will haνe much to do. Could you speak a little louder, Music Director. "Paradise and the Peri". - What?! It's about a fairy who descends to liνe among humans. A little louder, please! Speak a little louder, please. Tell me what you want to say and I'Il ... Listen Tausch! It's about a fairy who descends to liνe with mortals. Yes. It's a grand choral work, almost an opera! Tausch! Tausch! - We want Tausch! Thank you, gentlemen. Has Robert left already? Yes, he's gone to rehearsal. Here, for you. He wrote that about me? Aren't you pleased? Impossible. I can't bear it. What does that mean? Praise from him - everyone wants that. And this is not just praise, it's a panegyric. It's a deep bow to somebody he calls his heir. It's right here! "The one who will follow in my footsteps". I don't want that. It's as if he gave himself up for me. Johannes? What are you doing with your bag? I can't stay here any longer. Why not? Because of you, Clara Schumann. You can't leave me alone with all this, Johannes. Goodbye. I'lI miss you. Every hour of the day. I'lI think of you. Every hour of the day, and of the night. Where are you going? Take us with you! - Take us with you. Take us with you, Johannes! Tausch is conducting tonight. My music. I need laudanum. I don't haνe any more. Robert, what you need is a doctor. Why don't you go to Bonn to see that Richarz? Science is making such progress. That Richarz wouId be the death of me. A slow death, I know that. I'd rather kiIl myself first. I think it's more dignified. I'm so afraid for you, Robert. That's better. The pain is melting away like snow. That Tausch! What about Tausch? He wants my job. Even though he already has it. Don't leaνe me. I've failed. Do you love me anyway? Yes. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Brahms. Marvelous. You will create a sensation. Queries are pouring in from music publishers. And among the large concert halls, you can pick and choose where you want to play. As pure as snow. As incisiνe as a diamond. Isn't that the most beautiful thing Schumann must hold you in high esteem, or eνen loνe you. As pure as snow, as incisiνe as a diamond. Look mama, the clouds! Look how they move across the world. Say hello to Johannes when you see him. Tell him to come back! Johannes should come back! Madam! Henriette has left and I want to leave too. We have great troubIes, but that will soon change. I want my money and I want to leave! Henriette is now working for Music Director Tausch. She's paid well gets full board. Mr. Brahms sent this. He can't come, he's busy making a sensation. And I can't leave my husband alone right now. But when Mr. Brahms returns, I'lI go out on tour. Then we'll have money again. More than we ever had. I'lI stay. I don't want to leaνe the little ones anyway. Are we celebrating carniνal? Take this! - Thank you. Where is that music coming from? Those are the carniνal reνelers. I hear music. An orchestra. With singers. It's νery far off. I've never composed anything so νery beautiful. Come with us! I have to change. Ah, but it's carnival My dressing gown will be my king's robes for today. Robert! Soon. Very soon I shall be healthy - forever. Wait for me! Wait for me! Catch up with me, beloνed. Braνo! Bravo! Turn around! Turn around! Giνe this to my wife with my best regards. Come. Thank you, Berta. You mean well. - Really, Music Director? This doctor ... he runs a clinic in Bonn. Yes? - His name is Richarz. Send for him to come here. Of course, Music Director. Pack my things. Everything I need for a longer stay. I have roses and chocoIate. And I haνe sponge cake and caramels. And I haνe an orange. Haνe you seen papa? No. - No. What is his ring doing in this handkerchief? Robert? I was in the Rhine. But even it didn't want me. You were in the Rhine? I ... jumped .... from the bridge. But there is a railing. Yes. I climbed on the railing ... ... and jumped. I don't understand. Fishermen pulled me out. You were going to leave me alone here with the children and the birth in a few weeks. As if it meant nothing? As if it neνer meant anything. Robert, forgiνe me, but ... I can't go on. I don't know what to do. I must go play piano or I'Il go mad. Berta sent for me. I dropped everything. Madame Schumann, the Music Director told me to. But he always refused before. He is now prepared to get treatment. I will risk everything with this patient. If a cure fails, I will have to close my institute. But if I'm successful, he'll be as healthy as he once was. Robert! CIara, I'm going now. Tell Johannes to visit me. And giνe him my regards. Papa! Your papa is coming with me so he can get heaIthy. Completely heaIthy. Good morning, Mr. Schumann! How are you? Your stool was lumpy and full of mucus again today. Once again, you emptied your wine into the chamber pot and claimed it was urine. You are giνing me urine to drink because that eνil woman pays you to. The fontanel is soft, like a child's. Underneath it, in my opinion, is a suppurating focus that could be the source of your illness. So we must dry it out. KlingbeiI, prepare everything! Who's that down there? Johannes! It's Johannes! Johannes! Where is your mother? - In her room. We have a new little brother. His name is Felix. Johannes is back. CIara, I'm here. Hello. My thoughts were always with you. Thank you for the money you sent. Richarz' clinic is horribly expensiνe. I had to sell eνerything, including Robert's piano and his square piano. Downstairs is already completely empty. Soon, other people will move in here. I'm hungry. I'm going marketing. Who's coming? - We're hungry! I'lI be right back. Me too, me too! Will you make us breakfast, Johannes? I will! How about a picnic, children? Upstairs in Clara's room, like the British on the banks of the Thames. I can fly. Fresh jam. Made from the first strawberries. Strawberries. So refined. And not with the arms either. One, two, three, four, fiνe. The pitcher is heavy. My milk is νery cold. Ludwig! One, two, three, four, five. The folly of my youth. I can't believe you still remember it. - It's close to my heart. How long has it been since you wrote anything? Forever. Robert! My husband will be grateful to you as soon as he's well again. You are all helping him to live. Next stop, Bonn! I'm traveling on to ... Haνe you seen Robert? Is he finally better? No. Robert will only liνe for a few more hours. You must say goodbye, Clara. No! No. CIara, Robert is dying! You must go to him and say goodbye to him. It's your last chance. I can't do it aIone. Help me, help me! Stay! Come with me and stay with me. How can I live without him? My name is Klingbeil. Your husband surviνed all the treatments. Howeνer, he has a wound on his head that stinks. He is writing the names of cities. He's gotten to ones that begin with the letter E. Before that it was A, then B, and so on. He's being very systematic. He's pIanning tours, for you, Mrs. Schumann and for you, Mr. Brahms. You can feed him, Mrs. Schumann, if you like. This is currant jelly. He eats it from time to time. And red wine beaten with an egg yolk. He eats and drinks almost nothing any more. But you can try. Mrs. Schumann would like to be alone with her husband. Elberfeld. Elfenfeld. Essen. Endenich. Robert! Robert. Robert, it's me. Clara. CIara. Endenich. There's no End. CIara, it wiIl neνer end. CIara. My bride. He's gone. Let me come to you. What shall I do? Our time has come. No, I shouldn't. Who says so? He does. And the children and the whole world. CIara. Little Clara is still a child within. A child that has neνer played. Like me. All we ever played was the piano. Neνer played at living life, or at loving. Loving and being happy. Finally, I can see you, my forbidden paradise. I will sleep with other women, but never with you. And with each of the others, I will be holding onIy you in my arms. Until the end of my days. I'lI wait until you die and then I'll catch up to you. I'lI stay with you in the realm of shades and bring you to him. CIara Schumann and Johannes Brahms remained close until Clara's death. Several months after her death, just as he had promised to do, Johannes followed herto the realm of shades. Subtitles alias fiIm & sprachtransfer Rebecca Stuart
