Move your car, you jerk! What do you want from my life? -What are you fucking deaf? Move! -Get out of the way! What are you deaf? Look behind you! Get out of the way. You're blocking traffic! -People want to get through. -Get off the street! What do you want me to do about it? Tell him! You dumb idiot! I'm turning here, you dumb idiot! Where you from, Oshkosh? Idiot! -Watch your step. -You're a dumb idiot! -You talking to me? -You are a dumb idiot! -You talking to me, asshole? -Wally, don't start anything. Who you talking to? The man's got something to say. Let him say it. Up yours! I heard that song before, pal. Now listen, dickhead! You got anything to get off your chest? Would you tell me who you're talking to? No, say one more word. Just one more fucking word. Come on! -You dumb asshole! -Hey, nice move! -Come on! You don't show me shit! -Who are you fighting this time? Wally! Wally, stop it! Stop it! Come on. Come on. Going up. Step up. -Fuck you. -Going down. Why do you feel you have to pass for someone with 20/20 vision when you're blind as a bat? -I don't feel I have to pass. -Yes you do. It's a sickness in your brain just like if you were trying to pass for white. -You mean I'm not white? -Oh, sit down. This is a scandal! What do you mean I'm not white? Why didn't you tell me this before? -You're my own sister! -Sit down, Wally. Goodness gracious. Do you know a lot of adjustments have to be made. I have to cancel the swimming lessons. What'll the guys at the club gonna say? I'm not white! Oh, it feels like it. Goodness gracious, sis, you're right! -Lord, help me. -Does Dad know? Twenty dollars across the board on Centipede. Thank you very much. Oh, just a minute. -You said that was all. -I know, but I want my 50. Do you know how much money you owe that bookie! Look! I don't want a lecture. Just give me my $50. This is the last $50 to your name, Wally. -I know, but $50, please. -Three minutes until post time. Three minutes until post time. And 50 dollars to win on Centipede. Come on, Centipede! You can do it! Come on! Come on! Come on! You can do it! Come on, you little bitch! -Who won? -It wasn't Centipede. Shit! You shouldn't have quit your job! Look the man treated me like I was blind. So try someone else! You can't go on like this, Wally. Get another job. Mr. Lyons! What's the matter with me? Mr. Lyons, the fire inspector... wants you to pick up papers. Much dangerous. Big fire. You must please sweep up before you close the shop. Mr. Huddelston, there's a vicious rumor going around this building that I'm deaf. I don't know how it started but I don't like it. It's very humiliating. So, let's try and put a stop to it alright? I feel like such a fool Mr. Lyons. You know that fire inspector don't worry about him! He's always coming around here sucking up trying to get bribes. You mean you don't have to read my lips? They told me that you had to read my lips. I feel like an ass. Especially on the last Thursday of every month. Sorry. Oh, I can't make a left turn, I'm going to have to swing around the block and park across the street. Park? You're not parking anywhere! Slow down and just pull over here by the curb or something. What are you talking about? I'm talking about I'm not a baby. I don't need a babysitter. Okay! Just point me in the right direction. -Point you? Are you crazy? -Yes! You take your cane or you won't even make it across the street. No. Put the cane-- Put-- What is it? Put it down. You know, I can hear, can't I? All I need is Big Mo. I want to see this. Here. Thank you. Good luck with the job. Excuse me, sir. Nice day, isn't it? So far, so good. I'll pick you up in front of the building. Remember, wait for the beeps. Wait for the beeps. Yeah, wait for the beep. -I will. Thank you. -What? Would you help me across? Yeah, take my arm. Here we go. Hey, sis, how am I doing? Great. Just great. -Thank you very much. -Oh, you don't have to thank me sir. After all, this to me is just fun you know. Just like a walk in the park. Here you are, safe and sound If you get in any trouble, just holler. Can I help you with something? Oh, yes! I'm here about the ad in the papers. "Salesman wanted. Must have sense of humor." Are you the owner of the shop, sir? Who are you talking to? There you are! Damn. Look at there. Contacts again. You see that? -I'm looking for Mr. David Lyons. -I'm David Lyons. Pleased to meet you David. Oh, I'm sorry. I read your ad about the Ivy League type. Tall, dark, handsome. Three out of four ain't bad, right? As you can see I'm kind of nervous. Really want the job. But I am a damn good salesman. I'm David Lyons. What can I do for you? What are we caught in a time warp here or something? The Twilight Zone, maybe? Any Martians here who want to speak to Mr. David Lyons? You're a funny, guy. I really like that ad you put in the paper. "Must have a sense of humor." Not many people would do that. But you did, I'm your guy. If you want me, here I am. -Would you tell me what you want? -Three fifty. -What are you talking about? -Three hundred, that's it. -Are you talking to me? -Two twenty-five! Listen man, two hundred and twenty-five dollars a week! All right, two hundred. I can't live on less than that. Who are you talking to? I'm talking to you, you prick! What do you say? Why don't you look me in the eye and say that. I would if I could, but I can't, I'm blind. -You're blind? -Yes, I'm blind. Now can I have the job? I had no idea. I'm sorry. Now you know. Can I get the job? You're really blind? Yes! I'm really blind, man! What are you, fucking deaf? Yes! I'm fucking deaf! -Yes, I'm deaf. -Deaf? You really deaf? -I'm really deaf. -How do you know what I'm saying? Because I'm reading your lips. Now, do you want the job or don't you? Because I'm blind? Hey, shove it up your ass, pal. I don't want no favors from no deaf asshole! Then go home! Get out of here! Give me some peace of mind. To hell with blind people! Just turn around and walk out! That's better. Now, I believe we agreed on 300. Three hundred what? What are we talking about? Just a minute, hold everything. Stop the music. -Do you like Harvey Wallbangers? -Harvey who? Wallbangers a friend of mine. I'll introduce you to him later. 'Cause tonight my friend, we celebrate! Not bad. -Did I hit the board? -No but you hit the wall. It's a lot better. Three Wallbangers Wally. -Drink time! -Where's your friend? He's coming should be here real soon. You're going to like him, too. -This is to you, Sally. Sally? -Here. And specially to you, Leslie. Thanks for buying the drinks. My pleasure. Hey, Wally, what's your friend look like? I don't know I've never seen him, but he smells real good. I think he's by the door. Dave! Dave, yo! -Hi. -Dave! -Over here! -Hello, I'm here. -Hi. -Dave. I want you to meet two very good friends of mine. -This is Sally. -Hi. How do you do? -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. And this lovely lady to my left here, this is Lisa. -Leslie. Hi. -Leslie, hi. And this is my good friend, David Lyons. Wally says you two are forming a new business together. -Congratulations. -Wally says that we're what? Wait, wait, we're not to talk about that now. Let's talk about Harvey Wallbanger. -That's who you want me to meet tonight? -Yeah! Bartender. Hey, asshole. -Sorry? -Who do you think you are? David Lyons. You must be Harvey Wallbanger. Wally's told me lots of nice things about you. Yeah, real comedian. Get off my jacket! Hey listen, asswipe. You better watch yourself or you're gonna be going home real early. Sorry, I didn't know I was standing on your jacket. What are you, the local constable or something? Who's your girlfriend? I think I heard my mating call. Stand up. -I am standing. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't think you understand. My friend-- Is a killer, that's what I am. A trained killer! Oh, Special Forces. You know! When I was in the Corps... we used to eat you Green Beret pussies for breakfast. -Eat this! -This guy's tough, Wally. Doesn't matter as long as I can hear him, I can hit him. -He'd put a hole through your head, Wally. -Fuck him and his holes! So, you ain't talking now, huh? Come on, bigmouth, say something. Let's get down. Come on, fuck face. Last night I was out with your sister. -Okay, butthead. -Hey! Hey, hey! You're all right, you're all right, champ. You're all right, he's coming. I'm going to give you the first hit. Now come on! He's coming, he's coming, Wally. He's coming. Little lower, he's shorter than you a couple of inches shorter than you. -Aim for 12:00. Aim for 12. -Hit him! Aim for 12. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Eleven o'clock! Circle right. Circle right. Circle right. Circle right. Circle right. Circle right. And left, left, left. Circle left. Circle left, left. And right! Right, circle right. Circle right. -Circle left. Circle left. -Would you stand still, huh? Get ready! One o'clock! Good. Good. Good! Twelve! Twelve! Five to three. I got mixed up! Circle left. Circle left, circle left, circle left. Why don't you shut up and let him fight. Move right. Move right. -Get ready! Get ready! -I said shut the fuck up! -Read my lips, asshole! -I got that. Wally. Dave! Dave! One o'clock! Son of a bitch! -Why you little-- Son of a-- -You had enough? Little creep! -How are you doing? -I'm doing great! -We should hang out like this more often. -Yeah, it's nice to unwind after work. Does that mean I get the job? Depends on how this fight comes out. So... I bought this big bottle of champagne. Must've cost 45 bucks. Nice of my sister to drop me off at Jones Beach and leave me there. So I sat myself down in the sand, started drinking... and sneaking peeks to see if people was watching me cry. Then I realized it didn't matter if they were 'cause I couldn't see them anyway. That's when I made a decision. I wasn't gonna piss my life away because of anger. That's when I decided, blind or not blind... I was gonna be the same lovable asshole I've always been. You haven't made that decision yet, have you? No. So how'd you become an actor if you're deaf? I wasn't born deaf. I got Scarlet fever in high school. It doesn't happen overnight I didn't lose all my hearing till 8 years ago. So why'd you stop acting? I started missing my cues when the other actors would turn around and I couldn't see their lips. They ever catch you? No, I don't think anyone knew. I just lost my nerve. -When's the last time you were laid? -Sorry, what? When-- You were eating. -When's the what? -Laid! The last time you were laid! Too sad. Next subject, please. You don't want to know. So where's your wife? I think she's in Cleveland. I haven't seen her for eight years. Nice lady? Very nice. Wonderful, warm woman. And then one day, she turned into this amazing creature, who could sit on the end of a broomstick... and take off into the air. She'd actually achieve flight. -I think I was married to that lady once. -Small world. Funny thing is this didn't happen to her till just about the same time I went completely deaf. Now isn't that a coincidence? Amazing. Who'd believe it? So, what do you want out of life? Before the show's over? I think just not to make a fool out of myself. That's all you want out of life? Well, I have this terrible fear... that I'm going to make some mistake... and everyone's gonna stand around and stare at me. Boy, damn! I wish I had met you eight years ago. I can fix all your problems in 10 seconds. Ten seconds? Ten seconds, if you trust me. You trust me? Yeah, sure. Listen. Hey, you're a good looking guy. Thank you. That's very kind of you. How's that feel? Good? Look a little silly to me. Kind of foolish. You see? Life ain't so complicated. -When's the next one coming, Ray? -Any second. That might be the truck coming now. I gotta go get a damn screwdriver. So, the blind guy around? Hey! -Where's the blind guy? -Who do you want? Kerew. Wally Kerew. I'm his bookie. I owe him some money. Well, he's waiting for a delivery. He'll be back in a minute. What's he out front? I'll go find him. You know I almost forgot. I need-- I need some... -Some, I don't know-- -Sorry, we're not officially open yet. I know. Listen, listen I need some of that stuff up there. What is that stuff up there? My tummy's all kaput. Whatchamacallit? What is that stuff up there? -The antacids? -Yeah, yeah, yeah listen, listen. What's the difference between Alka-Seltzer and the one next to it? -What's the difference between the two? -Di-Gel? Can you do me a favor. Would you read it out to me, please? Can you do that for me? You want me to read out Di-Gel? Yeah, my eyes ain't too good. Just read it, please? Jesus. "Di-Gel contains calcium carbonate. An effective antacid. It is also calcium rich..." -Where are you going? -Here. Take it. I wasn't trying to pull anything, honestly I wasn't. You were told to deliver this right from the airport. I thought I was being tailed I thought it was the cops. I didn't want to bring them anywhere near Mr. Sutherland. -You gotta tell him that. -No! You tell him that. I've got a car waiting out front. Come on, come on. I'm dead if I go with you. You're dead if you don't go with me. "...and bubbles of gas trapped in the stomach it can cause heartburn acid indigestion and that full, bloated feeling. And unlike plain antacids, the simethicone breaks up gas bubbles rapidly to relieve fullness and pressure." I feel like a commercial. What the hell was that? Wait a minute. Wait, my ass! I thought I heard-- What is this, hide-and-seek? What? What's this? -Hello? -Oh, no! -This guy's dead. -Wally, there's a gun here. -Don't touch it! -Move it! Freeze! Drop it! I said drop it! -What did he say? -Are you holding a weapon? -Yes, I am. -Throw it away, get rid of it! -Stay there! Freeze! -Don't shoot! Don't move I'll blow your brains out! -Wait. -Shut up! Please, be gentle. -Let's go. -Wait a second. You don't think I had anything to do with this do you? -Come on. Let's go! -Officer hold on! He came for Alka-Seltzer. The man asked me to read him a Di-Gel label. Can you believe that? We didn't have nothing to do we don't even know the man. Wally, would you get the money from the cigar box? -Yeah. -Officer, excuse me. Isn't there some nice-- Honest to God isn't there a nice way we can settle this? Can I at least get my coat? -Hang on, we'll get your coats. -Jesus! Wally, tell Mr. Huddelston to lock up for us, will you? Yeah. -Open it up! -You're sick! Dave? Dave? -Dave? -Head down. -Head down, bring it down. -Dave? Watch your leg, watch your leg. License one-David-George-X-ray... -756 -All right, let's move out. You really can't say whether this mystery woman fired the shot or not? No, I can't but if she was innocent... then why did she leave right after she heard the shot fired? -Well, that makes sense. -Gatlin. What's the story here? I got the commissioner crawling up my ass! I don't know the whole thing sounds kind of shaky. Because the deaf guy he's not so sure about the woman. The blind guy heard the shot but of course -can't make a positive identification. -Oh, for Christ's sake. You're feeling too Goddamn sorry for 'em! You're always feeling sorry for people that's your trouble. All right, I'll take care of this. Alright! Now we're gonna quit fucking around here and start talking serious. Now, you claim there was a woman present? Was there a woman present? -Was there a woman present? -Oh, I'm sorry you talking to me? You bet your ass I'm talking to you! Was there or wasn't there? -Was there or wasn't there what? -A woman present! I smelled a woman but I didn't see woman. What about you, wise ass? Was there or wasn't there a woman? What the hell do I have to do? Take you downstairs to a private room and ask you? He's deaf. You have to be facing him. Oh, Jesus! All right, no more bullshit! Was there or wasn't there a woman? -Are you serious? -Yes, I'm goddamn serious. Fuzzy Wuzzy was a woman? -The hell is he talking about? -He reads lips. You're talking too fast. Was there a woman present? Yes, there was... a woman... -present. -Why is he talking like that? Because he's deaf, not stupid. Can you tell me one goddamn thing about that woman? Yes! She has the most magnificent legs I've ever seen in my life. -Yeah, and she smells good too. -Alright! That does it. Now you! Don't tell me you didn't hear anything 'cause he heard it! And you don't tell me you didn't see anything 'cause he saw it. Now between the two of you, you saw and you heard everything! Some poor bastard's dead, so let's start answering some fucking questions here! -Excuse me, captain? -What? Professor Kasuda from up town. I think you'll be interested in hearing what he's gotta say. -His ballistics report. -What do you got? I think I can prove to a judge that both of these men had the mens rea. -What the hell is a mens rea? -It's a legal term. The lawyers use. It just means the intention to commit a crime. -Okay, come on, let's go. -Mens rea? -Put the cuffs on them. -How could we have gotten mens rea? -Don't worry about it. -Come on get up will you? -Did we take blood? -Will you get up for crying out loud! Get up! -Please rise? -Can you do it without taking blood? Stupid, he's deaf. You have to be facing him! Lab says that gun you were holding was the death weapon. We both use condoms. How is this possible? -I want to see a lawyer! -I want to see a doctor. -That's not all, Mr. Kerew. -I want to see a doctor. We found something in the pocket of the deceased-- -I don't want to use your blood test. -Joey Scotto? Can I have an independent blood test? We found your name on a marker in Mr. Scotto's wallet. "W. Kerew, $2800. Overdue." -Because I owe him money? -I feel sick. What? What are you doing? You owe the guy three grand, he comes to bust your head and your boyfriend here lets him have it. He is not my boyfriend. Mens rea? My God! No! Checkbook... knife... racing forms... pair of undershorts... and a ticket... to El Paso, Texas. It's not here! No coin. -I wish I hadn't killed him. -No, no if you had to, you had to. Now we know he had it at the airport. He must've made a switch over somewhere. The man who owns the newsstand, his name is David Lyons. He was talking to Scotto when I arrived. Could he be able to identify you? No. He never saw me. Also, he's deaf. Deaf? Deaf. And the other one is blind. Blind? Deaf? What is this a joke? No, no joke. I spoke with the building superintendent. Well! Let's go pay them a visit, shall we? Well, they're in jail now. Well then, let's bail them out. All right, Mr. Lyons, I need a nice full-face shot first. Then we'll get our side shots later. You ready? We're here because you owed that sleazeball $2800? Face forward, please. I happen to think that the Knicks were gonna beat Boston and they came damn close. Will you tell your friend to face the front please? Face front. Why'd you even go to a bookie? What do you need a bookie for? -Credit. -Face front please. He was the only one to give me credit. Now face front! Will you tell him to hold still, please? -What? -Hold still. What's he doing? Holding still. Not looking at you, looking at me! -What? -Face the camera. That's perfect. Tell him not to move. -What? -Don't move. I'm getting fed up with her. Why is he doing this to me? I just want him to face the camera. -He's not facing the camera? -No! That's news to me. -What? -Face the camera. That's better. Hold it. She should make up her mind. Shit! Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. -Is she saying "shit" or "ship"? -"Shit." Shit, shit, shit, shit. -Charlie, come here! -Yeah, why would she say, "Ship, ship"? -I need you. -It wouldn't make sense. Get him out of here I want him out, now! You're finished. I'll get you when you're sleeping. We'll be alright. Once they find that woman, they should let us out don't you think? What woman? They're not looking for no woman. They got their killers! Us! We're fucked! Captain, honestly-- -Jeez, you alright, pal? -What the hell is the matter with you? Can't you even walk? What do we have to do? Carry you? You don't have to do shit for me. The man is blind and you have him handcuffed? Are you crazy? Come on. For crying out loud. All right, all right, take the cuffs off him before he wrecks the goddamn joint. Don't do me no favors. Is everybody happy now? Are we all friends again? Come on now, let's go huh? Jesus. Joe! I got Lyons, David; Kerew, Wallace. Suspected homicide. -His lawyers are here, captain. -Whose? -David Lyons'. -My lawyers? You want to check him for police brutality, lady? You got as long as it takes to print him. Get in here. Mr. Lyons, I know that you don't know who we are. Just let me have your right hand, please. Our law firm represents the building you have your shop in. Yes. We've been sent here to try to arrange bail for you. -Great. -That's a nice surprise. Mr. Lyons, they can only hold you and Mr. Kerew up to 72 hours before an arraignment. But with a little luck, we'll have you out of here by five o'clock. Yes, and we're really pushing the "blind and deaf" angle. We hope you don't mind. -No, we don't mind. Use it. -We'll see you both very soon. Excuse me, miss, have we met before? -No, I don't think so. -Are you wearing Shalimar perfume? Yes, I am. You know, you have a remarkable nose. -Thank you. -Goodbye. Goodbye. I never knew anyone could be that beautiful. The lady's got style. I'd love to go to sleep listening to a voice like that. -Oh, my God! -Yeah. -The legs. -Yes, I can imagine. -The legs! -The legs. Of course. -It's her! -The killer? Captain, the lady in my shop that I was trying to tell you about, that's her! -What, the mystery woman is your lawyer? -She's not my lawyer. Oh, now she's not your lawyer? That makes a hell a lot of sense. Get out! She's not my lawyer, that's the lady you want! How come you couldn't give me a description of her? Because I never saw her in my shop! I only saw her from the rear. but she came in now I saw her face. She went around just now, I saw her tush sticking out I knew it was her! That's the lady you want. Stop her! Stop that lady! With a little luck, we really will have them to ourselves by five o'clock. -They seem awfully nice. -So was the chicken I ate last night. Right now, the police have us for murder... or we're gonna be bailed out by the killer. At least my way we have a chance. Are you with me or not? All right you guys, let's go, huh? -Yes or no? -Yes. Come on, move these guys, will you? Let's move them. Come on, let's go. We gotta go. I'm sorry, come on. Come on, come on! I bet these guys are really gonna enjoy themselves over at Rikers Island. I bet you'd learn to speak Spanish real quick. Won't that be nice? You know, I hear that they make the greatest kidney fricassee... with pineapple Jell-O. -It's really special. -All right, party time. Hey! What the hell! -Tell me when. Tell me when! -Now! -Hey! -Hey! Wait a minute! Open that damn door! -What's going on? -Protestors. Demonstrators? Good. Go with the flow. Mix in. Free Iran! Free Iran! Excuse me, sir! Could I have a word with you? -Now you're released, how do you feel? -Great. Do you really think you can stop Khomeini? Not if it's funny. A good comedy, as you call it, is worth its weight in gold. Have you read Norman Cousins? About the immune system? Damn, baby! Come on! Comedy! Hey! I want to know when this is gonna be on? I want my sister to tape it. I don't give a-- I don't give a fuck! Thank you. As you can see, this remains a complicated issue. How could we lose a blind guy and a deaf guy? This is going to look great on my record! -Son of a bitch! -I want these guys. Three minutes now! Calm down. Just calm down we'll get them I promise you. Yeah, we better get them. I'm telling you we better get them! Careful. Careful. Turn left. Wait. Let's try the door. There's a hole here, Wally. Put your fingers right in here, pull! -There's an alley! -Dave! I'm right here. I'm right here. Step down, step down once. Follow me. Careful. There's an alley right here Wally. Careful, turn right, turn right. Here's another door. It's open. Go on in. Kerew is blind. Repeat, blind. Lyons, David, 5'10", Caucasian, blond hair. Lyons is deaf. Repeat, deaf. Form barricades. 6th Avenue to Hudson, Houston to West 4th. Every available cruiser, scramble now. How does someone so beautiful go and kill somebody? I don't understand that. Careful. The broken wood is in front of you Wally. That's it. Oh, wait a minute. Hold my head. -Hold my head, Wally. -Okay. Hold my head. Thank you. Are you all right? Thank you very much. They told me to call back in 10 minutes. The judge is just getting out of court now. We can have them in half an hour. This way, Wally. -Don't guide me. Don't guide me! -What? Don't guide me, they're looking for a blind guy and deaf guy. We just gotta get out of the neighborhood. You won't make it half a block. You'll crack your head open. -Not if you stamp your feet. -If I what? Stamp your feet. I'll follow the sound. -Like this? -Louder. Stomp your feet, I can hear the noise. I'll follow you. -That's good! Now move out! -Jesus! We gotta find the subway. -I feel ridiculous. -You look fine to me! I think we should kill them. I think we have to. We don't want them to identify us. It's not up to me. It's up to Sutherland. If he wants us to kill them, then we'll kill them. Right now, I just want to get them out of there and get the coin. Mr. Kerew? How did you get out of jail? -Who is it? -It's all right, Mr. Kerew. It's us. -Your lawyers. -Shalimar. That's right. Shalimar. What is Mr. Lyons doing? He's going to the bathroom he's gotta go real bad. And I told him, if you gotta go, you gotta go! Go! -Wally? -Yeah? Don't worry about me! You go on without me I'll catch up later with you later! When you gotta go, you gotta go. You know? Not everybody can stand around and wait! Just go! Don't worry about me, okay? I'll catch up with you later! Do you hear me? Sure. I hear you fine. You snuck up on me. Damn you. Well I guess you're close enough now. You can read my lips. Yes, I can. -Guess who I ran into today? -Who? The... -kidders? -Where'd you learn to lip-read underwater? The "killers," Mr. Lyons. The killers. May I have the coin, Mr. Kerew? What coin are we talking about? They may not know they have it. Excuse me. Let's see if I can find it. I don't know what you're looking for, but it's a little to the right. Here it is. -Here what is? -It's a rare gold coin, Mr. Kerew. Very valuable. Your friend Mr. Scotto put it in your cigar box before he passed away. You mean I've had it all the time? -Well, now what? -Well, you know how I feel. Can we go now? I'll call our employer and find out. -Say, my man-- -Mr. Kerew, not so fast. I just wanted to know, maybe, you make a lot of money in this line of work, do you? Yes, Mr. Sutherland, we have them both. And the coin. Yeah. -Yes, actually I do. -Okay But there's no unions, no benefits. -Really terrible. -That's right. What time do you land? I'll return tomorrow morning at approximately 8:37. Alright we'll go to Great Gorge in the morning, and we'll wait for your call. But we have to leave the country tomorrow morning. Don't worry, my dear. Everything's arranged. -All right, Mr. Sutherland, bye. -Scabs? I don't know what that is, scabs? Well, sort of like a picky person. What's it to be? I'll wait in the car. No, no, meet me in the alley behind the diner. Goodbye, Mr. Lyons. I hope that I bump into you again sometime. I don't think so. See, I'll be leaving the country... and you'll be dead. Dead? I thought you weren't gonna kill us. Afraid not. Goodbye. Wait-- wait a second. Don't we get a last request? What would you like? Would you scratch my nose for me? You're a very sick woman. Thank you. Mr. Kerew. What would you like? I suppose a fuck is out of the question. I'm afraid so. Goodbye. Alright! Let's go, gentlemen. For God's sake, we don't know nothing about no gold coin! We didn't even know we had it. Why do you gotta kill us? -Because you're both witnesses. -I don't understand this. Why are we walking to an alley to make it easier for you to shoot us. Why don't you just do it right here? Why in an alley? Why don't you kill us right here? -Fine. -Bigmouth! Wait. We won't talk. I promise. Please, don't do this. Dave, stop the begging, man. We gotta go out with dignity. All I want to know is, what time is it? -Did you say what time is it? -Yes, I did. What time is it? Your time is up, Mr. Kerew. If I have to die, I want my friend to tell me what time it is. What time it is? It's 3 o'clock. Not yet. Not yet. It's 12. Wait. It's 10 o'clock now, wait, 12 o'clock. -Make up your mind! -It's 12 o'clock. -It is not. 12 o'clock It's 11:15. -Yes, it's 12 o'clock. It's 12 o'clock. It's about time! Quick! This way. This way. Careful. Narrow. Narrow. Other way! Other way! Hurry, Wally! Hurry, Wally! Come on, Wally! This way! Get behind this car. There's a car. Watch your knees, watch your knees. -What's up? -Policemen they've set up a barricade. This is running. Anybody in it? -This is a squad car, Wally. -I know that. Is anyone in it? -Wally, I can't do this. -Yes, you can, come on. Wally, my hands are cuffed. I can't drive. Who said anything about you driving? C'mon, we gotta get out of the neighborhood. -Wally, we're not gonna get 10 feet. -Yes, we can, get in! Wally, you're gonna kill somebody. I got the wheel, you take the pedals, okay? Did you just say something? I got the wheels you take the pedals, okay? Oh, no! Forward! Wally, go forward! -How am I doing? -Don't look at me watch the road! -If it'll make you feel better. -Left! Watch out! Headquarters, this is barricade four! Headquarters, this is barricade four! I hate when that happens. What are you stupid? You want to die? This is a police emergency. Out of the car. -Yes, I'm with the Thatcher squad. -Show me your badge where is your badge? -This is my badge. -Don't hurt me. They crashed through the barricade in one of our squad cars. Who the hell was driving? I think it was the blind guy! -Get in the car! Open that up! -What's up, Captain? Get me down Seventh Avenue right away. Turn right! Turn right! Stop! Turn right! Straight ahead. Left! Right! Straight! Left! Left! Turn left! Turn left! Right. To the right. Right, right. Little left, we're going the wrong way on a one-way street. Little right. Nigga, drive slow! A little right. a little left. Little right! Turn right! Where are you going? These streets are bumpy. You're driving on the sidewalk! What the fuck was that? Go on home. Your mother's looking for you. -Get me close. -I'm trying. Left, left. I said left. I said left! -You said right. -I said left! A little left. -Where am I? -Turn right! Right! Right! Cows! Cows! Cows! We're in a warehouse, and you've just hit a cow. I think you better back up. And stop! Stop! Go slowly to your left and try to stay off the sidewalk. Turn right. Turn right. I just ripped my good pants. I can take the wheel now. Slide over. Slide over me. Wally! Wally! I can't see. I can't see. Wally! -I can't see. -I can't see either. Wally, I can't drive. -If you don't push the seat back. -I'm stuck. Push the seat back! Find the little lever and push the seat back. I've got it! -What happened? -We had a very close call. -Thank you. -Wally, I can't see. -Move your hands. I can't see. -Okay. I'll get that son of a bitch now! Is that somebody shooting at us? I didn't hear anything. -Wally, left! -You're mashing my nuts! You're mashing my nuts! Brakes! Wally, put on the brakes! Where are we? I think we're floating towards New Jersey. -No shit! I got relatives in Jersey. -How nice for you. You could read her lips, right? -Yes, I could. -What did she say? She said, "I'll give it to you tomorrow. We'll go to Grace George in the morning and wait for your call." Then she said, "We have to leave the country tomorrow." We have to find this Grace George lady, and wait for them to show up. Are you with me? Am I with you? Of course. You've earned my trust, Wally. You're always watching out for me. You never get me into trouble. Sometimes life is a little boring with you... but that's a small price to pay for such a wonderful friendship. That's a sweet thing you just said. Do you mean everything you just said? I'll tell you exactly how I feel in just a minute or two. Right now I'm a little overwhelmed... by the stink of the 7000 tons of garbage that you drove me into! Is that what it is? I thought you let one go. That's why I didn't say nothing. That was kind of you. Thank you. 2286, this is Dispatch. What is your location? 2286, please respond. Over. Can you please hurry? We have to bury the car. Je-- -Jesus! Be careful, will you? -Take it easy, take it easy. You know, I'm doing damn good for a blind man. What'd you say? I said I'm doing damn good for a-- You know what? I'm getting tired of this deaf shit. You mean to tell me you can't hear anything I say, even if I scream in your ear? -Well I don't know, I've never tried it. -Really? No. It seems crazy, after all these years but I've never done that before. I would like you to. Go ahead Wally. I want you to. Let's give it a try. Dave. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to try. Open up them pores okay? Be responsive to what I'm going to say. I want you to hear me. Okay? Shazam! Can you hear me? What! -Wally! -What? -Wally! -What? Jesus! I heard something! I heard your voice! -You heard me? -Wally, I heard your voice! -You can hear me, Dave! -What? You can hear me! No, schmuck! I'm deaf! Now do you get it? -I'm not a crybaby. -You are a crybaby. Guess what you are? A blind, egotistical asshole who denies he can't see shit. Denies? You're the one who denies! This is you, right, "I'm not deaf. I can read lips. Don't call me a deaf person." Well, fuck it. I'm blind! You hear me? Because some asshole drunk drove me into a fire hydrant, and I'm blind for life. He gets six months' suspended sentence. But I say fuck it. I'm not going to worry about him. Fuck him. -You swear an awful lot. -You're fucking-A right! Fucking A! Something bothers you, fuck it. Your wife leaves you, fuck her! Boss fires you, fuck him! Fuck it, fuck, fuck them. Fuck it, right? -You're fucking right! -That's right. You know it's a blessing to be able to do that. You're a lucky guy. I can't do it. You're a lucky guy, I can't do it. Well, fucking change! Easy for you to say. It's not easy for me to say. I'm blind. You're blind. But when you walk down the street, people want to touch you. Don't they? When you're deaf, they don't want to touch you, 'cause they might catch something. -Like you're some kind of leper. -We're being a little bitter aren't we? I just want to accept what I can do and what I can't do. I don't think running around catching vicious scum killers is something you and I are the best equipped people in the world at doing. Bullshit! You're an actor. If you don't tell anyone you're deaf or blind, we can do anything. -I guarantee it. -You guarantee it? That's right. And if you won't help me, I'll do it fucking alone... because I don't need you or anyone else! Well, okay. Well, now I get the point. Excusez-moi, Monsieur Hot Shit. I think I'll just go have a nice hot bath and a little cocktail before dinner. Wait, Dave, look, we ought to cool out a little bit, you know. -Have a nice day. -Just keep our heads high. I figure me and you, you know, we know a lot, Dave! Goddamn it, Dave! Dave! How in the fuck do you expect me to get out of this shit? Dave! Shit's cold! Come back! We have to bury the car! There are steps coming up, Wally. Three steps. And, one. Oh, no! Back, back, back. Back, Wally And turn and one, two, three. And turn. Very good. That's lovely. And go. And we go. -Hello? -Collect call from Earvin Johnson. -Will you accept the charges? -Yes, operator. -Hi, guess who? -Just tell me you're all right. I'm great. I'm doing fine, I wish you were here with your car. You know, you could bring up lots of money, a couple of beers, if possible, probably cold. -I need a racing form and binoculars. -Where are you? A little motel on the interstate... about five miles west of the George Washington. Headquarters, headquarters this is Steely over. She's going into room 18. Now. Now. That's a hell of a place to park. She's checked into room 18. -Where's that? -Over here. Right here. Let me have that. This is the police. You are surrounded. Alright, you jokers, you got 10 seconds to come out with your hands up. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... -She said she was 18! -five... -four, three... -The country's really cracking down. two... one. All right, let's go! -Goddamn them, goddamn them. -Take it easy, Captain, we'll find them. Search the entire area. Now they gotta be around here some place. Come on, guys. For Christs sakes, how far could they get? And all cars alert! Sgt. Keller, I need every available man you can spare to surround the area and comb the hills. Damn those guys. I'll get 'em, I'll get 'em, I'm gonna get 'em. We gotta cover every road. We gotta make your men aware that this is a number one priority manhunt. We can't let anything... Dave, I'll like you to meet my sister, Adele. Adele, this is my dear friend, David Lyons. -How do you do? -How do you do? There she is. Careful, your knees. First thing we do is find a phone book. Look up this lady, "Grace George." Then we get the coin, they come looking for us and then we wait for them with the police. There can't be that many Grace Georges in the phone book. You mean the resort? No, the person's name that's who they're going to give the coin to. Great Gorge is a big resort in Vernon Valley. -How do you know that? -I almost got married there. I think David got things mixed up. What did she say? She said she thinks you're an asshole! -We're sorry, sir, we're fully booked. -Oh, c'mon you gotta have something. I'm sorry, sir, we're fully booked. I'm so sorry. But everything is taken by the medical convention. We have people coming here from all over the world. I just don't have anything. -What about cancellations? -Did she say she doesn't have any rooms? Yes. I don't want to take my wife to a motel. We're supposed to hold these till midnight. I have a couple from London... a doctor from Sweden and one from Germany who still haven't arrived. I'll tell you what, if none of these people show up by 10 o'clock, I'll let their rooms go. But you have to wait till 10 alright? All right. Thank you. Can we go to the bar? Yes, of course. Sorry, I couldn't help you. Hi, I'm blind. Could you just show me to the ladies' room is? Oh, sure, it's right over-- Oh, sorry. I'll show you. Give me your hand. Oh, no, wait. The other one, here we go. Thank you so much. Here we are Mr. Knacker. Your tennis lesson is at 11 tomorrow morning. You're Dr. Johannson from Sweden. Johannson from Sweden. -I'm from Sweden. -Can I help you, gentlemen? I'm from Sweden. -You must be Dr. Johannson. -Yo, Johannson from Sweden. I'm a Swede, and you're a sweetie. -Thank you. And you must be...? -I'm Dr. Kesselbaum. You mean Kesselring? Kesselring! Right. I forget my own name next. You are one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen-- It's-- There you are. You move so fast, like a little hummingbird. You're a little sneaker. You got wings like Mercury. You're such a nice little-- Oh, there he is again. You gonna rub it off aren't you? A little lunch you had left over there. -Here you are. -Danke. Danke schön. Dr. Kesselring we thought you might not make it. It says you had trouble with your visa? Yeah and then suddenly they accepted American Express. Go figure! We don't go home without it, I'll tell you that. -Here, why don't you fill these out? -Thank you. Here you are, doctor. I got mine and you got yours. Now we're all out of double rooms but I saved you a suite with two queens. Well, get them fellas out of there! We want to get some sleep. Right, doctor? Here we go. Here's your key. Thank you, thank you. Come doctor, we gotta get some sleep now. Make some Z's. I hope you don't snore, I'll have to send you back to Germany. That's better than Philadelphia. Good thing the girl remembered the sister. Put out an APB on that convertible. Where the hell can they be? They couldn't have gotten very far. -Who knows with these guys? -Yeah. They're beginning to get to me, Gatlin. I'm telling you, these guys are getting to me. -Take it easy, Emile. Just take it easy. -Don't those state cops have anything? Jesus, I have 28 years on the force, a wife and five kids. Blind guy and a deaf guy making me look like a real asshole. Now, that's the truth. Sam 1, over. I think it's them. -Nuts! -What is it? They just went behind some trees. There! There! Yes, it's them. They're going into the building. Tell him to hurry up 'cause this isn't easy! Hold it steady down there. This isn't easy. I know where the coin is, but he's in the room you gotta get him out of the room. I'll get him out of there. You just get the coin. Wait! I need some money. I might have to buy somebody. You all right, Dave? Trouble. Hi! Give me room 149, please hurry. Yes? What? I told him I had enough trouble with two-wheel drive. I just hate this, mister, I hate this. All right, all right! It's not the end of the world, it's just an accident. You're damaged. I'm damaged. If you just remove your car from my bumper-- No, no, no, you don't understand, he'll kill me, My husband is an insurance man, can you imagine if I didn't file a claim. That's not my problem. I'm in terrible hurry madam, please. No! Wait a minute you know what, I got my card now don't get excited. I know I have it. It's right here. -Thank you for helping me. -That's okay. That's why we're here. I must have left my keys on the dining room table, darn it. -You want me to wait? -No, no, no, I've gotta go to bed. I had a humongous breakfast made me kind of tired. I got these three postcards and I registered for the bingo. That's a lot for one day wouldn't you say? -Yeah. Well, you take care of yourself. -You too, madam! Bye-bye! Bye now! -I'm right here. -Good! -You'll warn me if anyone comes? -I'll yell my damn head off. Nobody's going to come, man. Just get the coin. Are you sure you put him in 357? Maybe he switched rooms and he went off duty. -No, no, it's not possible. -Oh, shit! There are no other rooms, Dr. Cornfeld. I have nothing to switch to. There he is! -Dr. Johannson! Dr. Johannson! -Dr. Johannson! -Dr. Johannson! -Wait! You! You, you. Where have you been, doctor? I've come to pick you up. Well, I'm a little bit too heavy for that, my dear. -Too-- -Did you get lost, Dr. Johannson? Yo it's "Yo-hannson." How soon we forget. Well we have to hurry, doctor the seminar is beginning in two minutes. And we don't want to start without the main performer. Great! I'll wait here for him. And when he comes, I'll be down-- Always joking. I had no idea you were this much fun. Kirgo? I'd like to introduce our panel, four eminent specialists in their field; Dr. Saul Jenner, cardiology, Dr. Harold Orlow, pathology, Dr. Rita Bennett, ophthalmology; and in his first visit to the US, the eminent Swedish gynecologist, Dr. Conrad Johannson. Yo. Hold it right there. Get away from that table or I'll blow your brains out. Move! Get them up. Come on! Hands over your head. Both! Both of them! You're good. You're real good. This is the best relationship I've had with a woman in eight years. So long, sweetheart. Another time, another place... we might've had a chance. You will write, won't you? Dr. Johannson, my question is for you. In your paper on multiple orgasms in geriatric women... you attribute increased sexual appetite... to a lactose-restricted diet. Now I know you're modest, but I really must insist on pinning you down here. Doctor, which exercise would you find most beneficial to geriatric sexuality? Oh, boy. Well, some of my patients prefer walking. Some prefer bicycling. But for your best results, to guarantee satisfaction... most of them like fucking. You know... I like it myself, you know. One in the morning and late at night. -Put everything back in your purse. -No, no, no. Please don't. And you remove your vehicle. But if he leaves me, what is going to happen to me and the twins? I don't know anybody. People never treat me as nicely as you do. I've been extremely rude. You're right, I'm just going to leave you now. -No, no, no. You must move your vehicle. -I'll get out of your way. No problem. -It's against my car. Look-- -Kirgo! Where the hell were you? Well, I'm sorry. There was an accident. This woman rammed into our Spider. It was all very simple till she made it complicated. But why can't you give me numbers? Why are you being so evasive? -What is it? -What's wrong? Shooting pain in my head. My eyes! Oh, boy, it's a bummer! I can't see. Someone take me to my room. Dr. Johannson, Let me have a look. Look at what? Don't look! -Come here now, now come on! -Get your hands off of me! Stop acting like a baby. I'm a doctor. Let me have one little peek. Don't touch that head! Whatever you do, don't you touch it. -Who are you, sir? -Fine, thank you. Now just relax. Everything's going to be alright! I'm right here. Oh, my goodness! I thought you'd never come. -You know what's happened to him? -Of course I know what's happened. This is called "Blindness Hystericus." -Oh, my God! -Sometimes it comes just like that. -How do you treat it doctor? -The left and right brain... are in a fight with each other and you gotta distract them, just for a minute. Now, Dr. Johannson... how many fingers am I holding up in front of your eyes right now? -Three! -Good. That's pretty good, considering that he's blind. Now, doctor, I want you just relax. Take it easy and you tell me the first thing that pops into your brain. Pussy. It's amazing! This man is cured. Come on, doctor. Come on! We gotta take a little walk, get that heart pumping. And then it's going to be all brand new. Come on, doctor. Guten abend. -That's it. Easy. -Where's Adele? I don't know. She's not in the room, she didn't leave a message. See if he gets too excited too soon, it comes right back. Gently, gently. Take it easy, doctor. This guy's blind as a bat. Watch your step. What's the matter with you? Guten abend. You got a Lyons and Kerew registered here? I'll check, sir. I'm sorry, we have no one registered. One guy's blind, the other guy's deaf, you sure they're not here? I'm sure sir. I just checked. Look, I'm with the police. If I bought you in some pictures. -Could you identify them? -I'll try. -Look do you have a security officer? -Yes we do. Right behind you. Single file, single file. Okay, take it easy. Take it easy. Excuse me. Where's the little Alfa? The little red Alfa? -They just took off. -Who? Three of them. A lady with great legs... an English guy and a black woman. My God. My sister. Hey, the man, he asked me to give this to you. "If you want the girl, bring the coin to the house with a thousand windows." Route 104. -Is this a joke? -No. That's the Sutherland Estate. I hope you have an invitation. He's got some pretty mean dogs up there. -Dogs? -Yeah! Dobermans. Big, huge, they're killers. -Do you have our keys with you? -Yeah. -Just do me a favor. -Sure. If we're not back in 30 minutes, call the police for us? Police? New York Police Department. Ask for Captain Braddock. Come on, Wally. And tell him-- Sorry. Sorry, Wally. Tell him Lyons and Kerew are at the Sutherland Estate. The house is all glass, and it's on huge rocks. -My sister? -Nothing yet. There's a lot of land here. -There! -What? It's a greenhouse. There she is Wally! -Is she all right? -I think so. There are the dogs. Three of them. Now they're leaving. They're going. Looks like they're locking the door. Now they're going back to the main house. She's going to be all alone in about two minutes. -You all clear on the plan? -Clear as a bell. I'm gonna go water the plants, if you don't mind. Hey! You sure there's only three dogs down there? I better take a look. The parking brake has been released. Yeah. Just the three of them. I don't see what could go wrong. The parking brake has been released. You hear that Dave? Better check the brake! Wally! -Dave? -Wally! I'm in trouble! Pull out, Dave! Where are you, Dave? Dave! I can't-- The parking break has-- Dave! Talk to me. Dave! Dave! Speak to me! Dave! Dave! Talk to me! Talk to me, Dave! I can hear the car, but I can't hear you! Dave! I can't see you, Dave. Thank you. Dave? Dave! Oh, Dave. My God, what have I done this time? Dave! Oh, shit! Dave! Oh... my God, Dave. Dave, you say something? Talk to me. I can't see your lips. What are you saying? Dave? Can you see them now? Yeah. Yeah. There you are. What are you saying? I'm saying... I think it's over. I didn't just fuck my life up today. I dragged my sister into this shit. I damn near got her killed. And I hurt you. I just want to say I'm sorry, Dave. Don't back out on me, Wally. Dave, I've been running on fumes most of my life. And today I realized, for the first time, I'm full of shit. Well, that's true. But this morning, I threatened to shoot a naked woman... with my erection. Now that doesn't happen every day. That's true. The man's got a point. We'll get her out, Wally. We'll get her out. I think we're in over our heads, Dave. Nobody ever thought we would get this far. Don't back out on me now. -I can't. -You can. We can, I promise. We can. What if we can't? Fuck it. Damn you. I created a monster. Where's the girl? She's in the greenhouse. Where they can see her. Good. And when can we expect our two distinguished guests? They should be arriving at any moment. Do they... have the coin? Yes, they have the coin. Wonderful. What do you think of that thing? Lot of trouble over a little piece of gold. I don't know what this is, but it's not gold. Gold doesn't chip and peel away like this. Doesn't matter to me, as long as they want it real bad. You better hold on to it, just in case anything happens to me. -Nothing's gonna happen to you. -Good! Glad to find that out. -Ready? -Ready. Okay, Wally. Start counting. One... two, three... four, five... ...sixteen, seventeen... There's a dog. There's a dog! There's a dog! No, Dave, no. There's an alarm! There's an alarm. Dave! No, Dave! Dave, no! Dave! So far, so good. Almost. There. Now, what's all the fuss about? Well, I was gonna mention the alarm... but something else came up. -Who is it? -I was so hoping you'd show up. Oh, sorry about the flowers. You like roses, huh? That's enough, Herman. It's all right! Just keep your gun pointed on him. I'll check if he has the coin. Hands over your head, Mr. Lyons. Remember? Turn around. Careful. You remember what happened last time. Können Sie mir Zigaretten geben? Hit her! Hit her, Dave! Smack her! Hit her! Hit her, Dave! What's--? Hit her! Jesus! I grew up with brothers. Let's get out of here. Wait, wait back up, back up. You have to run up that log. I don't have that many brothers. David! -Get out of here! -I don't want to leave you! Go on get out of here. Wally's just on top of that hill. Go on! Get out of here. Get out! Jump! Get the police! Here's the blind one. Come in, Mr. Kerew. I'm delighted to see you. I'm delighted to see you too. So you're the fat fuck that runs this show. Beautifully put, Mr. Kerew. You're obviously a poet, a man after my own heart. -Does he have the coin? -Yes! It's in my pocket. May I have it, please? Why do you bother with a phony coin for? You're quite right, Mr. Kerew, it's a phony. A magnificent phony. May I have it, please? Would you mind telling me what I've been running around risking my life for? A superconductor. A room temperature superconductor. I dare say it may be the most valuable material in this world. Can you imagine an electric cable at the size of that coin... that could light up an entire city. You told me it was a gold coin. Making it look like a coin was just a handy way to get it out of Washington... after I'd arranged to borrow a small sample. Mr. Sutherland, I'm currently pointing a gun at your head. I think under the circumstances that you and I should renegotiate our contract. Don't you? Yes, I do. I agree with you completely. What would you say to... one third of eight million dollars? Would you say that's fair? Yes, I'd say that that's extremely-- What the hell just happened? I turned out the lights, just for a moment. Just long enough to gain the advantage. How come I got the feeling, I'm not the only person in this room who's blind? Because you have great intuition, Mr. Kerew. I also suspect you have excellent hearing, like myself. A few sounds were all I needed to lock in on poor Mr. Kirgo. It's too bad. I liked him. He was a gentleman. I can't see your face, but I bet you're not crying. Nor can I see your face, Mr. Kerew... yet I can hear you stooping down to find Kirgo's pistol. Am I right, sir? Do I have to put a bullet through your head to prove it? Oh, no. You're a gentleman. -One murder a day is enough for you right? -Get him! Did I hear something drop, Mr. Kerew? -Mr. Sutherland? -Perfect timing. Come in, my dear. -I've brought the other one. -Excellent! Wally. Are you all right? You're very quiet, Mr. Kerew. Suddenly gone shy, have we? Adele got away, Wally. The police will be here any minute. You'd better tell me what happened to Mr. Kirgo, Mr. Sutherland. Certainly, my dear. Mr. Kirgo decided on the last minute to renegotiate his contract, and he put a pistol to my head. Eve, we've been associated for almost five years. I want you to know I have no intention of killing you. So don't be frightened, my dear. Please, don't do anything rash. No, I wouldn't do that. You know I trust you, Mr. Sutherland. But I would like to know what your intentions are? To leave the country as soon as Raoul sets my helicopter down. I invite you to come along. Rio can be captivating this time of year. Just pick up the gold coin, I believe is on the floor in front of you. I don't see it. Look in Mr. Kirgo's left hand. I think he may be holding it for us. Did you... find it, my dear? Yes. Yes, I found it. Would you hand it to me, please? May I ask what my share might be? One... half of $8 million. Would you say that's fair? Yes. Yes, I think that's very fair. Dave! What's going on? Dave? Dave? Dave? What just happened? Mr. Sutherland is no longer with us. Dave? Dave! I'm right here, Wally. I hear sirens. The police will be here soon. If you drop that pistol now, you'll probably make some license plates and play a little volleyball every afternoon for a couple of years. I'll even wait for you if you want. Thanks. That's real sweet. But you see... you're the ones they're looking for. Not me. If I get on that helicopter with the coin, I get out of here squeaky clean. You're too tall for me anyway. I'm afraid I'm going to have to lock you in. Sorry. Damn, she smells good. I hear jail ain't so bad anyway, if you like it up the butt. -I'm over here, Wally. -Over where, Dave? Dave? Dave? Da-- Shit, who the hell I'm talking to? He can't hear me. -She's running to the helicopter. -Nice air conditioning she made. -You ever want to be in the circus, Wally? -No, afraid of heights. -Would you give me your jacket please? -What you want my jacket for? There we go. This should be fun. -Ready? -We're not up high are we? No, just a few feet off the ground. -Ready, and-- -I'm ready! Go! I just knocked over a tree! You said we wasn't up high! -Wally! -I'll kill you, you fuck! You telling me we're not up in the air? What do you mean not up in the air? -Motherfucker! You said we wasn't-- -Get ready! Get ready. Bomb-bay doors open! -Now! Start it up! -Get ready to fire one! -I'll kill you! -And fire one! Fire two! What the hell do you think you're doing? I don't know I'm blind but I learnt this at the Braille Institute. They told us to feel around, and see what's happening. Stop that! Get your hands off me! Hold it! Hold it right there! I said hold it right there! or I'll throw your brains out! I'll throw this knife right through your brain! Freeze! -Do what I say, or you're a dead man. -Turn around! Face front! That's better. Now put your hands over your head. -Come on, come on. Get them up! -Get your hands up! Oh, you do speak English. Alright! Come on over here. Get your ass over here. -Quickly, quickly! Slowly. -Slowly! Come on, come on. Not now, Wally, I'm busy. Come on, keep coming, you funny little turd. Hey, Tarzan, turn around and take a look. -When did you guys get here? -I sure was worried about you two. It's all over. Goodbye, Captain Braddock. Captain Braddock, you're a dickhead. -You son of a bitch. -No, no, no. Captain! -I got a surprise for you! -No, no, no, you can't do that. I know, I know the law. Now I get to shoot them! -No, you can't. No, you can't -What do you mean I can't? Captain, we got the real killer. We got the real killer. What are you telling me that I can't shoot them? No, sir, I'm afraid you can't. Come on. We went through all this trouble to catch them, now you're telling me I can't shoot 'em. It's time to go. Come on. I want to shoot 'em. I want to shoot 'em! No, no. We'll get a nice hot chocolate. Why can't I shoot 'em? -We had a damn good time, didn't we? -Yeah. Lot of nice memories. You know, Wally, there's something I've been wanting to do since the day I met you. -That was two days ago. -That's right. That's right. Well there's something I've been wanting to give you for two days. Dave, you don't have to give me anything. I mean... You're a real nice guy, you know that! -But I want to give it to you. -Dave, please, listen to me. -I have a lot of love for you. -Thank you. So tell me, how's it feel to be handicapped? I've always wanted to ask you that. I'm not handicapped. I have you.
