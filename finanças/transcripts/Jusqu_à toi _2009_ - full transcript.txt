When I was little, I was constantly talking to myself. I went into my parents' room, I stood before the mirror and told stories. I did not notice I that the reflection is not responding. For me it was a real person, with normal life, like mine. Then I went to school I had to talk to others but it was like with reflection. Then I met Pierre. With him I felt like talking, felt like listening to him. I needed the exchange. Then when he left, because his father was transferred from Paris There was nothing no mutual exchange, no reflections, just books, characters in films. Unlike them, real people always disappoint. And what are we? Unreal people? But, Didier, it's not the same. - How is it not the same? - Well, no! - No, you're neighbors. - And the neighbors are not real people? Actually, no, they're not real people. Tell me who takes them into account. Well, you see, you do not know! Neighbors are not a category. Not a social group. It's not an occupation nor an ethnicity. Nothing. Chloe, say neighbors are something otherwise you make us cease to live. - Chloe? - Yeah? JUSQU'A TOI And... This and gas, please. Win a romantic trip to Paris! Hey! Who do you think you are? You can’t litter like that. - Come on, go pick it up! - Ok, ok. Sorry, I missed! - Happy? - Retard! I'm leaving! Jack. Liza? - No! - What happened? It just keeps committing suicide, over and over. This is bug in the system. Rufus can't seem to fucking fix it. I mean, between you and Liza what happened? - Why won't she return your phone calls? - Come on, you handsome bastard! Couldn't find yourself a nice little French girl. Get shagged! Transatlantic relationships, very good! Go to Paris, get laid! - Guys! - What? They hate us! They think we're just a bunch of fascist, pompous, patronizing freaks who can't appreciate old smelly cheese, put a Starbucks on every one of their street corners, and ruin their wine through globalization! - They don't want us there! - Where? In Paris! In France! In the world, generally. We are not welcome. Bollocks! And what's all this "we" business? We. Americans. - No, you Americans. I am Scottish. - And I'm from New York. Yeah, and you live in America. And we saved your ass 60 years ago. Well, technically, you didn't. And as for everything else, it's a load of shit and you know it! You need to get outta this hole and go and see the real world, my friend! As it is, not how you think it is! Isn't that a bit exaggerated? Global stability, humanity, they will know that it's not mine! - Yeah! You're oyster humanity. - Oh, great! - Do not worry, I'll rewrite it. - But be quick! It fascinates me, too. - Chloe, Pharmacom Can you do you! - Really? - Really? - Yeah. - Your article was really... Arrange everything necessary for a trip to Brussels. This is interesting, Chloe. - Pardon? - Not much of a traveler... Afraid of planes? No! Just not gifted at certain things... Airplanes, telephones, love. Lacking talent in love? I probably do not know anyone so incompetent. This is sad. - A little. - Do you know I'm still here? - You are annoying! - Stop! I have never had such an annoying husband! You've never had another? This is because I'm so disgusted by my experience with you that I never wanted another one! - Yeah, right! - Even when we met! - What are you talking about? Even then... - Yes, even back then! Coming! And how on earth do you think you'll make to Paris? I mean, you weren't even able to get yourself to Bennington last year and that's less than 50 miles away! People change, mum! People don't change. I mean, you don't change. I mean, I could change, your sister could change, but you don't change! Well, I just did. You can't take that! Yeah, why? Why not? - Well, that's your father's suitcase. - So? This is all he had when he came to this country. This suitcase. Dad got here when he was five. That was in the 40s. This suitcase is from, like, the 70s. Okay! Take it. But I know you. You lose things. - No, I don't. - You lost my dog! He ran away! Probably because he was suffocating here with you! Well, don't lose this one. There's a lifetime of memories in this suitcase. Like what memories? He ​​never even... The ones of all the trips we didn't get to take. Hey there! - Can I ask you something? - Yeah? You're scared to travel, right? So why would you get Liza a trip to Paris, in the first place? I won the trip to Paris. I think it was fate, really. What? You won the trip? Yeah, I won the trip in a coke can. It was a promotional thing. Well, that's not fate, that's consumerism. - At least I did something... - Yeah, you did something, you were an arse! You know that Liza can't get time off of work, just like that. You never had any intention of going there, did you? Why go anywhere? Why go anywhere when everything everywhere is exactly the godddamn same? So, this is goodbye, yeah? Here. What's this? It's a book. Yeah, I see that, I mean... Do you think I'll like it? Yeas, bawbag! I think you'll like it. This book is a bit genius. Like, if you're feelin' a bit lonely books are good company, you know. Nice suitcase! Thanks. It was my father's. - It's the last thing he left me. - Yeah, yeah I don't need to hear the story. PARIS, FRANCE Sorry, I can not read your writing. What does it say? Little red suitcase. Couldn't you take it as hand luggage? I'm afraid that if the drawer opened above the case would fall on my head. Is this fear? It's dangerous. Here you are. I'm scared of food trays. That they will fall on you? No. That I'll be poisoned. Trays from the vending machines for drinks here. But I do not know why. Well, me too! This is special! I'm afraid of everything that isn't human... fax, phone! But there is someone on the other side... Yeah, but only voices. You do not know where they are. At work my friend Josee handles all the calls and also my polls. I write her articles in return. So we help each other. - Too much talking? - Yes. Your passport? - Thank you! - English? What is your problem? I lost my bag. It's raining. The journey took two hours. - Why didn't you buy a raincoat? - No, no raincoats! - Doesn't Didier have a night shift? - No. We keep trying for a child. This is a good period. That's why he's here. Can not miss it. I'm 38. - See you soon. - Bye! I'll get it. Some meatloaf leftovers. And my fish? My fish is dead? Didier says I overfed it. You killed her? The good news is that they brought your suitcase. And I took it. The messenger didn't want to give it to me, but I was convincing. Very convincing, you know. - What is it? - Probably your suitcase. No, this is not my suitcase. I come for my fish and find a suitcase. What does it mean? Fish is a bad sign. Well, I'm going to bed. Hey, Chloe! - What? - It is suspicious to open strange suitcases at home. Do not open it. Thank you! Fuck. - I don't have any luggage. - Yes. - No bags. - Yes. So basically... - You didn't do anything. - Yes. - Not tip. - Not tip? No bag, no tip. - Not tip? - I'm sorry. Fucking curse. Zimmerman. With Z. Z-I-M-M-E-R-M-A-N. Like Bob Dylan's real name. But it's Jack. Not Robert. And it's a red suitcase, An old red suitcase. With wheels and a bunch of stickers on it, of places I've never been to. Well, it was my father's suitcase. And, you know it's all really we have left of him, so... We being my mother and I. - Yes, sir. Just a red suitcase? - No, no! - I'm very sorry, we can not find anything, sir. - No, thank you. Please hold on one second! Ok, thank you, don't go anywhere. Excuse me, hello! What are you doing? - The cleaning? - Yeah. Why? I don't know. Cause that's what I do. Ok. Don't you usually knock? You know, and then say something? Like, "Permesso!", and then I say "Avanti!", and then you come in and clean? Like this. Permesso? Avanti! And then you come in and you start cleaning. Not when there's... Bastard! Right. Well, ok. Now's not a good time. If you could come back later, please? Thank you. Come back. Ok, ok. Thank you very much. Hello. Hello, I'm calling you because of luggage confusion. Hello? Mrs. Klein! Complaints department, how can I help you? Hello! Yes, Mrs. Klein! Pharmacom is unique, I know it well. But will join in such a competitive environment, such as pharmaceuticals. There can be problems. And that betrayal is absolutely... I'll do it! Really? As always. I do all you want! What? Complaint Department? But you'll write this article. Deal. And you, Pedro? 3 DVDs which your dream woman would like? - 28 Days Later! Grudge! Cube! - Psycho looking for a psycho. Why wouldn't a girl like horror movies? - Will you ever be normal? Freak! - What about you, Chloe? What do you like? Imagine that when I was coming from Brussels, my suitcase got lost. Well, they brought me another one instead. - That wasn't even mine. - So what? - I opened it! - Yeah. - Well, yeah. - What's that got to do with it? - Are you stupid? The inside of a suitcase is like a DVD. It tells you about a person. There is nothing better than DVD. Were in that any, at least? So were there any? It's crazy! I love this book "One Hundred Years of Solitude", you know? - Well. - What? It was in his suitcase! In English. This can not be a coincidence. Well, I'll leave you to consider. - I'm going to explore one's life. Bye. - Bye. - You're going after her. - I do not care. - Wait! 28 Days Later, Friday the Thirteenth, Jeepers Creepers. - You? - Yes. I've had a promotion. I was looking for a place to eat. Like McDonald? Yeah, like McDonald's, but better maybe something a bit more French. Yeah, yeah, McDo. - McDo, yeah. - No tip, no information. Ok. - I said, no tip, no information. - Yes, I heard you, thank you. Ok. Excuse me. What is it? Le boudin (pudding). Boudin... Is there something wrong with it? No, your pudding. This kind of staff these days. All you need is cornish pasty and cream tea. We went to the Louvre today. Oh God. Yep. And we're supposed to go to the Saint Sulpice church tomorrow. We're following the... We're following the da Vinci trail. Da Vinci? Really? Yeah! Anyway, I'm Pat. We're from Cornwall. Yeah. You come here alone, then? Heh? Yeah, sure. Yeah. My wife says that you should come with us. But she did not say anything. Oh, no no no, she doesn't talk any, oh no no. But I can read, what she thinks, deep down, you know. Thank you, but I really should stay here. I have a suitcase I'm waiting for. Oh no! 18 years! 18 years we've been married, this way, yeah. I had an affair only once. Yeah. A waitress on shanty dandy pub old Pickled Lobster. Yeah, gave her the portion. Big Bertha, her name was. But I was pissed, I didn't mean nothing, you know. But the wife, she she found out and hasn't spoken to me since. Don't think we'll ever get past it. Cheers. Don't do that to her, don't hurt her. - Ok, go! - Yeah! Ok. Ok. - Tell me you're alright. - Yeah, yeah! Ok. - Good boy. - Oh, this is nice. - Yeah, this is nice. This is nice right here. Hey, come here. You know, you gotta treat your wife better. You know? You should take her someplace! Man, you should take her someplace nice. Just you and her, no kids, you know. Give her reason to smile again. 'Cause you know what, man? You know what? She's gonna speak to you, if you just give her a reason to smile. Yeah, are you some kind of puff? - No! - No? Well, you get awfully emotional, when you're pissed, mate. - Got my article? - Listen. I started writing it last night and I can not get into it now. It's blocked. Nevermind, I arranged it differently! Well, you get it too can you do otherwise. Find this American on your own. and report on Pharmacom burn. You have to start from scratch again, ring those people around, ask them questions. Scary, isn't it? Everyone will know that Chloe Mondoloni cheater. Damn! What is this crap? Why is it blocked? This is a virus or what? Who would do this? No one? What? - Can I have another glass of water? - Yes. Of course. Suzanne wanted me to tell you that she would be glad if you came home for lunch on your birthday. Well, if you want to, of course. No. I don't know if I want to celebrate it this year. You can invite someone. - Who? - Well, I don't know... It's just... I have a feeling we're not seeing each other much. Yes, that is right, now... I do not blame you, Chloe. We're both responsible. But I'm concerned that you're a little like me. - What do you mean? - You know. A misanthrope, recluse. Like when your mother left and I do not want to let anyone near. Remember the old tables for table tennis? Yes. After your mother left, for years I have played alone so the other side of the raised. Of course, balls would come back, but the returns were no surprise, I always knew precisely where the ball goes again. So I started looking for someone who would hit to the ball back. Sometimes it was a bit soft, or too violent, sometimes the other played too poorly or too well but actually, every time it was different. I'm just trying to say here, it is a bit grim, to lead a lonely life. A human is created, to share life with somebody. If you found someone I'm happy for you and I would be pleased to meet him. Well. I was abandoned, too. I lived in the same house that you did. We could play together. You could teach me how to play table tennis. I can return the balls. Hi, Liza? It's me. I'm just calling you from Paris. Visiting all the places, that we always said we'd visit. That you always said we'd visit. Cause the fact is, I never wanted to go anywhere. And I'm just calling to tell you that I'm sorry. I know I always told you that I just wanted to make you happy, but now I realize that I was just thinking about myself. It seems that it is here. Well, then I went to the Louvre, then the l'eglise Saint-Sulpice, and then I went to the Chateau Villette. Wait! Are you following the da Vinci trail? - No! - Sounds like you're following the da Vinci trail. No, I'm not following any trail. There is no Jack Zimmerman living here. I'm almost absolutely sure. Are you really sure that there is no Jack Zimmerman here? And what part of "absolutely sure" do you not understand, young lady? This "almost". You said "almost absolutely sure". - And that leaves room for doubt. - There is no doubt. I know about everything, it is my job. Are you perhaps suggesting that I'm not doing my job right? No? Good bye, Miss! Hello, it's Liza, please leave me a message and I'll call you back when I get to! What is it? Not here? Am I losing my mind? Just what would I say? That I like his suitcase? And I know that he is the man of my life? That it seems more like it more and more every day? And that he definitely has to come to my birthday? This would seem insane. I'll have to find a way to meet him. He must get to know me, like I know him. Very rich fauna. La Camargue is a magnificent reservation. I need somebody to clean my room. I need my dirt vacuumed, I need your filth cleaned. Make up my room! - Yes. - Please stop that. You hurt her feelings. - What? - My sister. You hurt her feelings. So now she doesn't wan to clean any more. Just tell your sister that I am sorry, ok? Micheline. What? Sausage would you like to say something. I'm sorry. Ok? Can just someone please clean my room? That's all I ask for. Yes. Yes, thank you! Thank you! Hello? Yeah, Chloe, here's Pedro, above all, return the DVD but that's not why I'm calling. Myriam told me about this suitcase, and so, even if it is less good than DVD when you want to get know someone I admit that it is wrong, but I have an idea in case you're be interested. Put your name and address in the suitcase with three DVDs that you like the most, and turn in it. This is a clear message! Whoever gets the suitcase, will know if you are compatible according to the theory of compatible DVDs at 89.70%. That's all! Bye! Jack, you don't get out much, so I thought you might like this. What do you got? Home porn? No, no, just our sad, little sightseeing throughout the country, really. Look! Jane? Where are we going? Well... I'm a bit of a hand, eh? That's right. You know, give up your day job. Sorry, let me go. Hi, Jane! Jane. God, you really have got a face like a smacked arse, don't you? Look, Jane, I know life was being bloody hell and I know I've been a naughty boy I know I have. But just give us a little smile, eh. It always looks better later on if you smile on the picture. I don't have much to smile about. Jane! You... You spoke! Jane! Oh, I missed you Jane. I really missed you. Welcome back, my love! Welcome back! Will you blow me a little kiss? Come on, blow me a little kiss. That's it. You know, you really are a beauty. That's the woman I married. Olala! Olala! I got tired of your "Olala!" - This is good. - That's it! Yes, of course. What are you doing? You know perfectly well what I'm doing. I'm fired. You took care of it? - No, I had nothing to do with it. - Well, it does not look so. But no, it's just that... I had an emotional problem. You're not the only one who has problems, Chloe. - You too? - Yes. You're completely alone in your little world, and you do not see anything else. - This DVD is yours? - Give it to me! Well you know what? It seems like you were right all along, my friend. I do need to get out and see the world a bit. Open up, have a good time. Yeah, lovely. Listen, you have to come home, mate. - What? - Permesso? Yeah, hold on! - Huh? - Permesso? Si! Si! Avanti! Avanti! What were you saying? Annette ran into Liza yesterday and... Here you go, Mr. Zimmerman! Jack? Jack! I'm on the phone here! Hey, Jack, I've got other things to do. Yes. Annette ran into Liza yesterday and it seems that she misses you, mate. She actually believes you've changed. I know it's mad, isn't it? I'm coming home! I'm coming home! - Alright! - Love you, Jack. - Enjoy Paris! - Three cheers for Jack! - Three cheers for Jack. Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! - See you, Jack! - Wait, wait! Get together. Hold on. Fromage! - Fromage. - I got it! So long! We love you, Jack! Come to Cornwall! What are you doing? Just picking up a few things. But I thought you weren't getting home until next week. Yeah, I was... Where are you staying? My mother's. She's driving me crazy! She's driving you crazy? She says that my late nights at the office are disrupting cats' sleep cycles. She says that? I think maybe you could spend the night here. You do? I do. For your mom's sanity. Thanks! So he already left? Who? Your friend. He's gone? That's how you like it? Yes, yes, looks good. Yes. He returned home to America. But it's been long enough. Describe him to us! So we could imagine him, please. Alright. He's not too high, but strong. Protects me. Gallant. For example, when it rains, he unhesitatingly gives me his poncho and he himself gets wet. We like the same things, even though we're pretty different. For example, he is very good at computers. It's hard to believe how good he is. This is great! It's as if I opened my eyes to the world that I have refused so far. With him it seems to me that everything is possible. With him, I want to go out want to follow him. It's so beautiful. This one is prettier than that other one. I understand that you prefer this one. You pay €237. €237. That's a lot! I'm sorry. I do not have them. I was out. I know it's not fair. But I was so convinced that... What? You found a man of your life? - Josee, what are you doing here? - Working? Do not think you will ever borrow DVDs. Here you are finished. What will I do without movies? These films running in your head are no longer enough? You could at least acknowledge that... Yes. For that I thank you. If you did not give me his number, our paths would not have crossed and probably would not have fallen in love. And so we owe you. But you expect too much. This will not fit. Understand this, she's right. You believe in perfect love. But Hugh Grant goes for the whores. Harry and Sally also don't end up together. In fact, she is still blind and he's a male loser. No one is perfect for one another. No one is perfect. Do you know what is happening to us? Everything falls on us, it's literally a curse! We will never have children, we'll divorce and you'll die of hunger, when I'll be living in the poor neighborhood. It is easy to blame the other, when you fail. We're not blaming anyone. Curse is no one that I know of. Curse is no one? Neighbor is no one too? I'd like to know, who has a chance to be with you, "no one"? I do not know. Ask Chloe. For her, nothing is anyone and anyone is the man of her life! Why do you have no sympathy for anyone? And the one who came out of nowhere is all good? But why is this so? Did you not ask yourself this question? I'm your best mate. When were you gonna tell me? Tell you what? You got shagged! Where did you get these? What's the name of your little French woman? Thank you Doris, very nice. Stop going through my garbage. I don't even know her name. Oh, a woman with no name, eh? Jack's making progress here. All I know is she stole my suitcase, invaded my space, and enjoys playing little mind games with me! I hate that girl! So you don't know her? My point exactly. Then I know what it is. This is a lead. This is a treasure hunt. This is fun! No, not fun! Evil. Very, very evil. Oh, come on. You have to admit, she does look pretty nice, huh? And she's a fan of "One Hundred Years of Solitude". She's read it 57 times. What do you think? What do you think she is trying to say? - That she's lonely. - MY HIDDEN TALENT MYRIAM, MY NEIGHBOR MY BOSS MY FORTE 13th MEETING 9th EMANUEL ON THE SQUARE NO 2, Chabrier 350/7, PARIS. CODE 25A53, 2 FLOOR RIGHT. SELF. WANT TO BE THE SHOE ON MY FOOT? Moment. Wow! You got yourself an art gallery? Yeah, Liza took everything and it seems like I had nothing after all. And it looks like you got your own little obsession. Have you heard of the 50 ways? Just slip over the back, Jack. Get yourself free. Forget Liza, go and find out what this girl's all about. Who knows, you could even find true love, or at least you could shag! That's my sister, idiot! Is it? Now, that's another good looking woman. Where's she at? She's at Dartmouth. She's a lesbian. Look, I'll look after your apartment, while you're away. This is so much better than my place. Alright, just try not to piss on anything when you're wasted. There's nothing here, my friend. It's a scam organized by pharmaceutical companies, one of which is the one that employs you, to conceal the sale of drugs with long expiration dates in some African countries. Mr. Peretz, I promise you that your name appears here. This is the bomb! And it can explode in their hands. I sent it to the printer. Well, Chloe. This is very good work. Thanks. Josee, told me the other day about your emotional problems. About what emotional problems? It's more about the fact that you do not have any problems. Which is probably worse. I want you to know that I do not mind that you do not have a love life. If this is what is happening to you, I'm fine with this. I was just wondering if you would like to have a dinner with me. Jack? I'm back! It's out of focus. Yeah. She's not a very good photographer. I was once in love. Yeah? Who was she? The girls I saw on a photograph. We are very similar, you and me. Is that her? Let me see. I know where this is. About the advert? Yes, yes, the ad. Okay. I'll get the racket. No! You should hold your racket like this. No, like this. You see. Can I just ask you a quick question? Yes, sure. Do you, by any chance, know where she lives? You're not here about the ad. Is that a bit much? Yeah, it's too much. Thanks. Thanks. These are pretty flowers! Who is this idiot? - Excuse me? - No, no, I thought. Whatever, let's go! Get out or I call the police. What? Myriam? How do you know my name? It's delicious. Can I take a look? Yes. Why he have the picture of my wife? How many times do I have to explain - Chloe gave it to him. - Yes, of course. - What? - You know very well. Well, I do not. You didn't tell me everything. I do not know that much! I do not like when you don't trust me. 18 years I've been tolerating your presence. If only you would be able to understand... Now I understand? Yes, I understand. Understand. Use your eyes. And understand, there was never in my life anyone else but you! She is completely... Do you...? But what kills me is that it is so beautiful! Thanks, love! I was there during the holiday internship and I stayed. And I climbed the ladder, gradually. Finally, I'm satisfied. I don't feel the desire to become a doctor. Journalism is the field work, you need to get your hands dirty, take a risk. In the magazine about drugs? No, I don't drink white, my head hurts after that! But no. With sauerkraut you drink white whine. So once we got there, you know, we went ice skating and had hot chocolate. And when it was time to go home they just left me! You know, I guess they had forgotten me, because I was so quiet! It took them 13 hours to find me! I had sever hypothermia... In a couple more hours I would've probably been dead. I guess that's probably why I'm not a big traveler. I really like to live in my house. But here I am and you know, I'm fine. I can go anywhere I wanna go - It's very nice. - Yeah, it's really nice. He would be so perfect for Chloe. He would be so perfect for Chloe. This is a pity that they went out with others. We have to do something. She can't be with that other guy. Enough about me. What about you? How did you end up in the paper? My mother was a pharmacist, still is a pharmacist. So I used to go to her drugstore and help with medication. I wanted to spend time with her. And later, when she left, I continued the work. I went there, I learned the dosage by heart. It was comforting. Smells, neon, small drawers. Maybe I wanted to help heal the wounds. I'm not sure. I quit. No! Because I kissed you? This is absurd! I'm the... I blocked the entire computer system. I did it, not Josee. No, stay, stay a while. We are good here. I'm sorry, Jerome. Hey, Chloe, I... I do not want to lose you. I've never been there. WAITING FOR YOU HERE, WHENEVER... I used to come here all the time before. Why did you stop? I don't know. I think I just sort of forgot about it. Sometimes you just forget how beautiful it all can be. When I was on my way over here, we were landing and I was looking out the window at all the box houses, and cars, and highways, just how it all organized everything the sheer immensity of it all. And all I could think about was where is Chloe? Which house is her? What car is she driving? What is she doing? And here you are. Right in front of me. It's funny. I would've never thought... You know, I've passed this hotel many times before and I'd never have imagined the rooms to be like this. I don't think they're really into redecorating much. Ever. But do they clean? I don't think they're very much into cleaning, either. Do you think there have those little questionnaires like "Are you satisfied, not so satisfied, very unsatisfied"? I highly doubt it. Too bad. I love questionnaires. Oh! I almost forgot! Here. I forgot to put it back in your suitcase. But I wanted you to have it, if you ever came. And you did. So, here. My friend actually gave me this book at the airport, before I came here. He said, in case I ever get bored. I could've used it. You've never read it? No, to tell you the truth, I've never even really heard of it. I'm kind of more of a magazine guy. Does that disappoint you? I... I don't really know right now... I'm pregnant. Really? Congratulations! Triplets. Three. Three? Three, it was a bit of a shock. But now we're happy. Will you be moving? You will live elsewhere. Well, for five people it is probably a little small. But we will always find some space for you. What about you and the American? You were right... I dreamed about someone who does not exist. I decided to let him go. I let him go. But now, I feel ready. When it's over I'm ready to experience a banal story with a normal man. I am ready to live in Pairs, with all the quarrels, transitional difficulties... Ready. I am ready. - Did you not like him? - I liked him, but... What? Yes? No, no. Hop in, mate! What happened? I just wasn't who she thought I was. I'm sorry, mate. All I'm saying is, coffee is better than tea. Mustard is better than ketchup. And Shakespeare is better than Gabriel García Márquez. Alright. So who's the best? Moses or Jesus? Which Moses? What do you mean, what Moses? Moses, there's only one Moses! No, there's the Moses that led the ancient Hebrews out of Egypt, and then there was the Moses the Ten Commandments. Two different people. What's wrong? I'll leave you two to it. Hi, Liza! Love the hair. What about you? Still burning in the midnight oil? Working the long hours? Yeah, of course. But I got a raise. Oh, good.

Oh, right, of course! - You are? - Rufus, a friend of Jack's! So, I hear you're a fan of "One Hundred Years of Solitude"? You know that book? Yeah! I love that book! Still with me my whole life.
