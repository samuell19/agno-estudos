(car squeaking) (ominous music) (ominous music intensifies) (crickets chirping) (loud ominous music) (children chattering) I'm sorry. Is this chair free? Yeah. Sure. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. (grunts) Wooh. Agnes, honey, we're leaving now. Please don't give her apple juice before bedtime. - Apple juice, yes. Like the other night. - Yeah, but no apple juice. - It's too much sugar. - Okay, no. Ciao. I can't wait to hear more about Derek and Hannah's cooking class. (Derek) Today we made ravioli with... I think there were bits of sausages inside it. You should come to the cooking class with us tomorrow - - because I believe that tomorrow they're making the gnocchi. The ravioli that they tried to teach. (glass clinking) Oh! Right. I'm sorry to bother you during this very lovely dinner. I just want to say two things. I hope we didn't wake you up. Because the noise you heard last night, the banging on the door, that was me. (all laugh) We couldn't find our way, so we were very late here. Sorry for that. We don't know each other. That's the way it goes on holidays. But I want to meet you people, because you look all so nice and beautiful. I want to toast... To you, guys. To Italy, of course. To the food, of course. And to love. - (all) To love! - (Patrick) Salute! (opera singing in Italian) - It's a bit touristy. - We are tourists. - Dad ... We can move on. What do you think? - Sheep! - Agnes, don’t shout. - What would you say? - I can't find Ninus. - Now keep track of that rabbit. - Don’t talk like that, though. Hell! Like a bunny. For kids. Okay. Ciao. (sighs) - It goes up and down, and up and down. - (laughs) It's so hot. But you... - Look who I found. - Thanks. - This is my husband, Bjørn. - Patrick. Nice to meet you. - We met at the villa. - Right. - Hi. Bjørn. - Hi. Karin. Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Louise and this is Agnes. And what's your name? Abel has difficulties speaking. If he feels some sort of pressure, he can get a little insecure. - There is no pressure at all. - And who is this? - Can you say what the rabbit's name is? - Ninus. Agnes just lost it, so Bjørn went to find it. - You went to find the rabbit? - Yes. That's very heroic of you. - Thank you. - No, no, I'm serious. Respect. - Well, thanks. - You're very welcome. So, did you guys have lunch yet? - Where are you guys from? - (Karin) Holland. The southern part. - Countryside, it's a beautiful area. - I'd love to move outside the city. - Being close to nature and all. - Well, you should come and visit us. - That would be great. - Vegetarian? Yes, thank you. - Tagliatelle with mushrooms. - Yes, thanks. - So, you're a vegetarian? Yeah. I eat fish, but yes, I'm a vegetarian. That's so good. We could all learn from you. - Good for the environment. - Thank you. I'm starving. - Thank you very much! - It looks good. - Looks great. (chuckles) Wow. I actually think that Dutch and Danish people are very similar. Yeah. So we're the same. (Bjørn) Well, in many ways I think so, actually. The same humor. The same erm... the same culture. At least we have more in common with people from Holland than with Swedes. - (Patrick) I'm so glad you say that. - Yeah? Really. I had a Swedish colleague when I worked for the Médecins Sans Frontières. - You're a doctor? - Yeah. He was the most boring and politically correct man I've ever met in my life. (Bjørn) ... you know saying, "We're stuck!" Like once we were in Greece, I was going with the cheering. - I was going: "Kalimera!" - Good morning. Brush your teeth, nightwear on. It's getting a little late, isn't it? Do I have to press the button? - No. No. No, now I do. Agnes. Otherwise you will not get any pizza. - Well. Are you tired? - Yes. (Louise and Agnes talking indistinctly) - Who should read a bedtime story? - Pappa. I need three. 'The spirit grabbed her with its beak and drew her down into the pool. - so that she drowned.' 'Well, now the children went home happy, and if they are not dead, - - are they not still alive?' What a thing. Sleep well. - Can you leave the light on? - Of course. So go to sleep now. - Love you. - I love you too. Look what we've got, honey. Okay. Turn it over. "Dear Louise, Bjørn and Agnes. How are you?" "We were just talking the other day - - how nice it was spending time with you this summer." "And even though it's been a while - - we'd love to invite you to come to visit us." "What would you... What do you say?" (Louise laughs) "A weekend in the Dutch countryside." "Food, wine and long walks." "And, oh, by the way, Abel keeps mentioning Agnes." "So funny. He really misses her." "All the best from Abel, Patrick and Karin." That's damn sweet of them. Could be a lot of fun? It's a bit of a long time to be with someone you don’t really know. We need to buy Agnes some boots. And I'm kind of thinking these. Yes. And we need to look at an autumn jacket before it gets really cold. (exhales sharply) (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (music intensifies) You dip. You use your fingers. There are plenty of napkins. We have plenty of time. It looks so good. We got an invitation from some people we met in Tuscany this summer. - Okay. Who are they? Are they nice? - Yes, very sweet. Yes. They were hugely nice. And he's a doctor. - We don’t know if we should do it. - We have flown twice this year. - Where are they from? - They're from Holland. - Then you can drive. - How long will it take? - Eight hours? - I think you did it in seven. - I think I have. Seven hours. - That's nothing. - You can easily do that. - Exactly. And we could drive at night. Good to have friends abroad. And it would be rude to say no. We had fun together and they have a boy Agnes' age. - Sounds perfect. - Yes. Well, maybe. - What's the worst that could happen? - Exactly! (tense music) (tense music continues) (music intensifies) Well we're here.. OK, honey. We’ve arrived. (Karin) Yeah! You made it! - (Bjørn) Finally, yes! - (Karin) Yes, yes. - (Karin) Hey. - (Louise) Hi. - (Karin) So nice to see you again. - (Patrick) Hey, man! - (Louise) What a beautiful place. - (Karin) Thank you. No, you can leave them on. Or take them off. Leave them on. Take them off. - Whatever you want. - Thank you. - Give me your coat. - Thank you. - (Karin) Sorry for the mess. - (Louise) Oh, it's nothing. It's gonna get much worse. Come on! - So, come in. - Wow! Very comfortable. - (Karin) That's the way we like it. - We brought you something. - It's a little souvenir from Denmark. - (Bjørn) It's Louise who bought it. Thank you! - Where is Abel? - Downstairs maybe? He's been cooking all day. He's making wild boar. (Bjørn) Wow. - Come on. This is your room. - Wow! That's wonderful. - (Patrick) Bjørn. You want a beer? - Yeah! - I want to show you my pool. - Pool? (Karin speaking Dutch) - Are not you going to say hello to Abel? - Hi, Abel. - He doesn't remember me. - Yes, he does. He's just a little shy. Look, Agnes. We made you a little bed. - Do you like it? - Yes, she likes it. We'll figure it out, honey. (Karin) I forgot the presents. I'm so sorry. (Louise) It's fine. (Dutch television in the background) Wow. It's coffee cups. That's sweet. - Yeah? - Yeah! And... a mermaid? Yes, it's something that I think represents Denmark very well. It's The Little Mermaid! I know it. I've heard it's quite small and disappointing. (laughs) Well, actually there are some anecdotes about it that are really nice. You know what is also nice? Louise. - This is for you. - No, no, that's fine. I insist... (Louise laughs) I insist. - No, I'll wait till... - It's my favorite part of the roast. It's delicious. Crispy and soft at the same time. If ... Yeah! Just take a little bite, honey. - It's good, right? - Very good. (Louise and Karin chattering indistinctly, dishes clanking) (gasps) Oh hi, Abel. It is really lucky we've got the GPS, otherwise we'd have got lost 20 times. - I had it under control. - No, the GPS had. I had. And we had a map in the car, honey. (Abel whining) Frightening sometimes how we lose our ability to find our way through life - - because we hand over the responsibility to technology. That is so true. I mean, people nowadays don't have a clue how to read a map. I must admit that driving in a car like that - - with GPS and all these modern things, you... I want to turn it off sometimes. (Abel continues to whine) - As you were saying, Patrick... - Is he alright? He's fine. He's fine. He'll fall asleep in a minute. He just does this sometimes. It's part of his disease. Yeah, what is that? (Patrick) Abel has "congenital aglossia". Meaning basically he's born without a tongue - - or with a much smaller tongue than you and me. - (Louise) But is he in pain? - Oh no, no pain. He just has a hard time making himself understandable. Oh no, I understand everything he says. (Abel keeps on whining) - Did she sleep? - No. - Dad, can you leave the light on? - No, now we have to sleep. You’re sleeping with mom and dad. So nothing can happen to you. Now we're just going to settle in together, okay honey? Then I'm sure it's going to be a nice weekend. (ominous music) (music intensifies) (Louise) Excuse me. Abel won't move and I want to slide. Abel, do you think you can move away? Because Agnes really wants to try it. Excuse me. Agnes really wants to try the slide and... Do you think it is possible to ask Abel to move away just for one second? - I'm so sorry about this. - No, it's okay. It's nothing. Patrick, he doesn't have to. -(Patrick) No, he wants to apologize. - (Karin) Yeah, he really wants to. Sorry. (Patrick and Karin talking Dutch) I must have the recipe. It reminds me of what we call a mazarin tart. A Danish thing. Come on. - I don’t think this is so nice. - Why not? I don't think they're very nice to be around. - Hey. Am I interrupting? - (Louise) No, of course not. Patrick and I would like to invite you to dinner tonight. That's so nice of you. There's a nice restaurant with great local food just up the road. We wouldn't want you to miss the opportunity while you're here. - (Bjørn) That sounds good. - (Karin) Great. (footsteps move away) She's pretty uncomfortable, huh? You'll probably survive a day and a half here. Are you looking forward to coming out to eat? Do we have anything in mind? - French fries. - I think so as well. Agnes, just take your jacket. Is Abel not going? (doorbell rings) (Karin) Yes! Perfect timing. (Karin and Muhajid speaking Dutch) (Karin chuckles) - He doesn’t speak English. I'm Louise. He doesn't speak any English. - And who is Muhajid? - He's the babysitter. The babysitter? (Patrick speaking Dutch) - But the kids are going as well, right? - No. Tonight is without kids. Didn't I tell you that? Mom, shall we go soon? - Hello. Come, come. - Muhajid is so very good with children. The whole neighborhood uses him and not only because he's cheap. (Agnes laughs) (Patrick) Guys, let's go! (horn honking) (Agnes laughing) (Patrick) Come on, let's move! (Patrick and Karin speaking Dutch) (Patrick and Karin talking Dutch) - Are we at the restaurant soon? - We'll be there in a minute. - Do you know what you want, honey? - If I knew what it said. - What is the stamppot ? - It's great. It's the house specialty. - You should try it. It's good. - And the boerenkool ? Oh, that's also stamppot. You'll love it. (Karin) It's delicious. They make it so well. It's all stamppot? - And what is stamppot? - Stamppot ? That's typical Dutch. Very traditional. It's like potatoes and vegetables, you stamp it all together. Mashed potatoes and vegetables. - Steef! Let me take care of you guys. - Yeah, fine with me. (Patrick speaking Dutch) - Remember I'm a vegetarian. - I'm sorry? - I don't eat meat. - Oh yes! So good for the environment. But you eat fish, right? So you're not a vegetarian, you're a pescatarian. - Yes. - (Patrick) Yes. (Patrick speaking Dutch) Hm? - And fish is not meat? - Of course. But it's better for the environment. And the way the fishing industry works and how we treat the oceans is - - not affecting the climate? Well, I would like to propose a toast for good times. - For good times. We say proost! - Proost! (Bjørn laughs) (rock music playing) (Bjørn) Well, I just hate this... (laughs) ... this teambuilding bullshit, you know. So I just felt like... You should have seen them. It was crazy. You should have seen them. They looked insane. (Louise laughs) (Bjørn laughs) Come on. Come on baby. - No. - Yes, hell yeah. (Louise laughs) Wow. Someone had a really good time tonight. - You want us to chip in? - Thanks, man. (Bjørn scoffs) So the dinner is on us? Oh, that's so kind. Thanks, man! Thanks. (tyres screeching) (Patrick chuckles) (rock music plays) (music plays loudly) Can't you ask him to lower it? Patrick! Can you turn down the music a bit? - Patrick, the music, can you turn... - I love this song! It's a great song! - Turn down the fucking music! - Listen to it! (Karin speaking Dutch) (Karin) I'm so sorry, he's just so drunk. I'm truly sorry. Okay? (Patrick) I truly apologize. I'm so sorry. (Patrick) And yeah! (music plays loudly) - Patrick! - Just a little bit, please?! - Just a little bit down! - (Patrick) Just a little bit. - (Patrick) Okay, a little bit. - Yeah! Thank you. (both sigh) No, I smell of smoke. I'm just taking a shower. (shower running) (door opens and closes) (footsteps approaching) (tap running) (tooth brushing) (footsteps moving around, brushing continues) (tap running, toothbrush clinks in glass) (door shuts) (breathes shakily) Was it a good shower? (breathes shakily) Should I turn off the light? Mom! Mom! I want to get into your bed. Please, can I come in to see you? Bjørn. Bjørn! Bjørn! Bjørn! - I want to go home. - Is there something wrong? I want to go home now. - Where's Ninus? - Don't you have him? - No. - Are you sure? Didn't you have him when we came out? - I don’t believe I did. - You don’t think so? Oh, for fuck’s sake. (unzipping and rummaging) - He isn’t there. - Honey, he's not there. - We’ll buy a new Ninus. - No! - We’ll buy a new one when we get home. - No, I want my Ninus! But he's not here. Stop now, Agnes! He's gone! (Agnes softly sobbing) Come on, baby. - I miss Ninus. - I understand that. Now he lives with Abel. And, he will be just fine. (dramatic music) Thanks Dad. (music intensifies) I'll be back in two minutes. - See! - No, damn it! Where was it? - It had fallen under the seat. - Agnes, goddamn it! Stay here. (talking in the distance) It's just ... How do I explain it? - (Bjørn) It's just... How can I put this? - (Patrick) Yes? - It's hard to explain because ... - Okay. - (Bjørn) It's hard to explain because... - (Patrick) Okay. Just get in the car again, honey. I'll be there in two minutes. We had some really lovely days here. - (Karin) What's going on? - Well. We have a situation here. Someone left without saying goodbye. No, as I was just trying to tell Patrick, we had some really lovely days. Then I ask again, why are you leaving? We had some good days, it's just... There's just some things that... ... that make us believe that it's best that we go home. - What are those things? I want to know. - (Bjørn) It's many things. Such as? It's just... such as... Such as the bed for instance. It's really small. And Agnes doesn't want to sleep on the floor, so she comes in at night. Can you help me out a little here? Okay. So with all of your respect... First of all, I'm a vegetarian - - but all you've been doing since we got here was serving meat. But we have all sorts of food. You can have hagelslag sandwich right now. No, thank you. And last night at that restaurant or roadhouse or whatever that place was... ...it was very uncomfortable to drive. And the music was so loud. And you were drinking and driving. And the way you were touching each other in front of us - - that just made me so uncomfortable, I'm really sorry. But it just... So many things have felt so wrong. I'm really sorry, but it's just how it is. (Patrick sighs) I'm in shock. Can I say something? First of all, Louise. I am terribly sorry that we forgot you were a vegetarian. And if there are things you don't eat, you just could have told us. Right? And our house is not huge - - so we cannot offer you a big luxury room and a king-size bed, Bjørn. Sorry. And I am truly sorry that Agnes doesn't feel comfortable staying in Abel's room. But we thought it was only natural. If you only knew how much Abel was looking forward - - to sharing his toys in his room with Agnes. And the roadhouse, as you call it. The hugging and the dancing. We were just having a fun evening, guys. Come on! I mean, dancing and kissing the one you love. What's the problem? To me, it's crossing the line when you pick up my daughter at night. And then you take her into your bed, where you slept next to her, naked. Yeah, but where were you, Louise? I mean, Agnes kept calling. She was crying. Where were you? There's nothing we can do now to change the way you've felt these past few days. It truly breaks my heart to hear that you haven't enjoyed your stay. It makes me wonder if maybe I've failed as a host. No one's forcing you to stay. But I really hope you do, because today is gonna be a great day. I promise you, today... it's gonna be great. (ominous music) It's this scissor. It doesn't cut anything, it's so dull. (ominous music continues) - Is it okay if I turn on the radio? - Yeah. Of course. You can turn it up, if you like. (upbeat music plays) So, what kind of music do you like? Oh well, I listen to - - you know, all kinds like pop and rock and.... Yeah, basically all kinds, you know. And you? Me too. Pop, rock... funk. I like music that I can sing along to. I like singing. - Yeah. Singing is good. - Yeah. Actually, there's a lot of great Dutch music. You want to me to play some? - Please. I'd really like to hear some. - You sure? Yeah, really. (inserts cassette tape and presses play) (gentle music plays) This is called "It Never Ends". (sings along in Dutch) - And who is it? - Trijntje Oosterhuis. I think this is how an angel sounds. (Patrick) I really want to apologize for my behavior last night. I'm sorry I made you feel so uncomfortable. Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it. You know, sometimes I have this... this thing right here. And it's so powerful and wild. And I like it. That's the weird part. I really like it. - You understand? - Yeah. - You do? - Totally. Normally I just... ... just try to hold it down or... - I keep it in chains. - Why? I don't know why. Too many rules, I guess. - It's... - It's what? It's clau... I don't know, it's... claustrophobic, you know? It's like I've become this person that I don't wanna be. And who is that person? I don't know, it's... ... just some guy. Some normal guy who gets up in the morning and... ... takes his daughter to school and goes to work. Play a little squash once a week. Have dinner with people that I don't even like. And I'm so tired of smiling all the time. Come. Come. I wanna show you something. (Patrick screams) (Bjørn screams) Woohoo! (both exclaiming) (water splashes) - It's fantastic! - This is the life, huh? (Bjørn laughs) Louise. Thank you so much for helping out in the garden. Oh, you're very welcome. (kids giggling) Mom, Abel and I made a dance for you. - They wanna show a dance. - That's so nice. Maybe when we have coffee. After lunch, honey. Agnes. Can you set the table, please? Can you show Karin how good you are at setting the table? Oww! - Argh Goddamn it! - Did you cut yourself? Get it under the cold water. - Does it hurt? - Yes! (Bjørn) Patrick, maybe you can take a look at her finger? Sure. It's good we have a doctor in the house. I'm not a doctor. - But didn't you say you were a doctor? - Did I? - Oh, I lied. - You lied? Yeah. Sometimes I get a little insecure when I meet new people. He just wanted to make a good impression. (Patrick and Karin speaking Dutch) - What do you work with, then? - I don't work. No, I'm unemployed. I've never worked. I don't believe in working. That's wrong. It's the other way around. Are you okay? (Karin speaking Dutch) - Okay? - Sorry. Oww! Okay. I got this. - Who needs a doctor, right? - (Bjørn) Yeah. (laughs) (Patrick) Erm... Bread, yes. You know, it's a shame that Holland is not really being recognized - - as a producer of fine high-quality cheese like Italy or France, for example. - Oh, careful. - We are a cheese nation. We export more cheese than any other country in the world, besides Germany. I sometimes feel that Dutch cheese is not getting the respect it deserves. (Karin speaking Dutch) You need to eat some of your vegetables. That's okay, honey. Everyone should come with Bjørn and me to the market and try Johan's cheese. Then they will give Dutch cheese the respect it deserves. Johan said it himself. Forget stilton, forget gorgonzola. Dutch cheese is number one. Right? Bjørn? The cheese at the market, it was good, right? - It was fantastic. - It was number one! Johan said it himself. Cheers! (Karin speaking Dutch) Stop telling my daughter what to do. It's not up to you to tell my daughter what to do. Okay? Relax. I'm sorry. (Karin snorts laughing) (upbeat song plays) (Patrick speaking Dutch) - Again. You do it so well. (Patrick) Sorry about that. - (Louise) It's okay. - Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4. (music plays) (Patrick speaking Dutch) - It's okay, they're both really good. - Yes, but he has no rhythm at all. - He's messing up the routine. - No, but they're just kids. But if he wants to reach his potential, he has to concentrate, right? Right. Okay. One more time. (music plays) (Patrick speaking Dutch) - I don't want to dance now. No, she has to stay because it's a duet. No, she doesn't want to. She doesn't want to dance anymore. - Agnes, just one last time. Last time. I promise. You are so good. Just one more time. So good. (music plays) (music stops) (Abel sobbing) (music starts again) (music stops) What's the problem? You cannot... He's only a child, for Christ's sake. I mean, what the hell is wrong with you? Can't you see he's crying? He's in pain? You can't talk to him that way. What is wrong with you? What's wrong? Because we do things differently? Jesus Christ, man. This is not about doing things differently. No! This is about doing what is right. This is really... to do what's right for you. Like showing your son some love when he's crying instead of shouting at him. Patrick, what the fuck, why can't you just let him dance? That wasn't dancing. You threw a cup at him! I can't listen to you talk to him that way. You threw a cup at the wall. Stop. Just please stop it. There, darling. Now I'm gonna go talk with Mommy. Okay? So stay here. Holy shit. Mom, is something wrong? Mom? Bjørn, take her inside, I don't want her to see me like this. - We'll go into the warmth. - Mom, are you upset? Go inside now! Away! Leave me alone! - Come. Mom needs alone time. - Thanks. Come, come, come. Come now. (kids' show playing on tablet) I can go take Agnes to flute on Tuesday, if you like. Agnes, it's Dad who's accompanying you to flute on Tuesday. Agnes? I'll take you to the flute on Tuesday. Then that's what we'll do. (door opens) (Patrick peeing) (toilet flushes) (door closes) (TV blaring downstairs) (Abel whining) (Abel continues to whine) (whines louder) (footsteps approaching) (stumbling noises) (Patrick grunts) (TV blaring downstairs) (TV show blaring) (tap running) (door bouncing outside) (tense music) (tense music continues) (Bjørn breathes heavily) (water gushing) (music intensifies) - Louise. Louise, we're going home. - Yes, what's going on? - You have to wake up. - What time is it? - Agnes, can you wake up? - Just relax. Come on, damn it! Hurry up, damn it. Come on, damn it. (warning light pings) (breathes shakily) (car approaching) (sighs in relief) (petrol pump whirring) (Bjørn breathes heavily) (tense music) (Bjørn gasps) (music intensifies) (tyres screech) Bjørn? (panting) (tyres screech, car stops) - Bjørn, what's going on? - Dammit man. (engine starts) (Bjørn breathes heavily) (engine revs) (wheels spin) - Mom, are we nearly there? - Yes, yes. I think we're stuck, damnit. (car engine switches off) - Do you have coverage? - No. There is a house. I'll run up and call for help. Lock the doors, okay? - Hurry up. - Momma. (dramatic music) (Bjørn panting) (water running) (grunts) Hello! (Bjørn knocking on door) Hello! Hello! (panting) (Patrick) Hey, Bjørn. Thanks for the call. I'm glad you agreed to meet us up on the road. Thanks for helping us out. It's very nice of you. Of course. (breathes shakily) Get in the car. (tearful) Please don't hurt us. (sobbing) Please don't hurt my family. We just wanna go home. Hey, it's okay. Relax. As long as you do as we say, it's gonna be fine. (Louise) When will we be back at the house? (Karin) It won't be long now. We'll be there soon, honey. (kids' show playing on tablet) Mom? - Is Abel still sleeping? - Yes. - Is Abel alone at the house? - Muhajid is looking after him. He was up early anyway, so... - Are you okay? - I'm fine. You have cold hands. You must have a hot bath. And thanks. (brakes squeak, handbrake creaks) (engine stops) (Patrick peeing) (car door opens) - Mom, I want to go home now. - We'll be there in a little while. Are we there soon? - Mom, I don't like it. - So, honey. - Mom is with you. - I'm scared, Mom. Be quiet. Excuse me? - Honey, just do as they say. We've taken a huge detour. Will you be quiet, please? Can you tell us when we'll be back at the house? (Karin shushes) We're going to your house, right? (engine stops, handbrake creaks) Bjørn, what's going on? (car door opens) - Mom, I'm scared. - It's okay, little darling. Mom is with you. But I'm so scared. Do you remember what mom always said to you? When mom's here, nothing can happen to you. - I want to go home to my own bed. - Yes. I will take care of you. - You have to tell us what's going on. - Shut the fuck up. Don't talk to my family like that. (Agnes whimpers) Shh... stay calm. Please let go of her. (Bjørn groans) - Louise. - Mom! - You will let go. - No. You will, you will. Mom! (Louise gags) Mom! - Agnes! - Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! (Agnes groaning) (Agnes screaming) (Louise screams) (Agnes gurgling in blood) (Louise groans) Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! (sad music) (sniffs) (sobbing) Why are you doing this? (Patrick) Because you let me. Take off your clothes. (whispers indistinctly) (both sobbing) Sorry. ﻿1 (Italian opera music) (opera music continues)
