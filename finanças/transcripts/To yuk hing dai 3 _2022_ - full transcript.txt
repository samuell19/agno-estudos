"Scar crime: Murder term: Life sentence" prison is a very special place it's a place with no women and all the criminals are rounded up everybody has strength and we exude violence every day It's alright... continue "Mak kin tin crime: Accepting bribes term: Release soon" it's survival of the fittest the most ruthless person is the person in charge But this is just a misconception the darkest days are over we as prisoners we just hope to stay safe and get out early friendship first, competition second mak kin tin wins! This bad boy is getting out in two days whoever had a quarrel with him or thinks he's more handsome than me go ahead and take your revenge alright, I'll count to three come on, alright? Three, two, one I should've paid you a visit earlier but I've been busy because I'm new here now it works out, you come to me we can have a nice chat you were the warden here before you should know the ins and outs or in terms of management you can perhaps guide me? "Tang hung chun Crime: Bribery term: 10 years" You were able to climb to this spot you're impressive in your own right you don't need my guidance this is not an easy job but I still gotta keep it going why do you want to meet with me? When can I get transferred to gen pop? I'm currently not exploring that option I'm not a first degree felon the court didn't order solitary confinement it was cheung yuen's idea he wanted to strip me of my rights as the warden shouldn't you educate your subordinate? You're mistaken I agree with cheung yuen's assessment so this is my decision as well then I apply to be transferred to gen pop I reject it Hey! Take him to the doctor yes, sir get up Dice up the winter melon and stir it with the egg yolk got it brother big roller, how much salt should I add? Just the right amount, as long as it's tasty alright Winter melon releases a lot of moisture so you can't add too much water to the congee alright "big roller crime: Manslaughter term: 30 years" try it while it's hot I made it myself, it's good stuff let me know what you think it looks like congee, but it's not congee it's quite bland it's for baby of course it's bland and without msg fantastic, baby's gotta eat well you're so hypocritical try for yourself give me your honest opinion so that I can improve it looks healthy enough big roller, when you get out your grandkid would be 10 years old he should be having steak, not congee steak? How about Clay pot rice? That sounds good warden is here, carry on eating sir, I have a request and complaint what's he up to? Ignore him, he's crazy you're scar, aren't you? Yes, sir I'm not saying this just for myself I'm speaking up for the welfare of my brothers go ahead, what's your request? Then I'll cut to the chase you know what's the worst part of being in prison? That is we only get one toilet roll each month I've done the math, there are thirty days in a month we only get four sheets per day that won't be enough to wipe my ass with I only have two sheets left uncle seven, I won't have any left it's not an insane request I just want four more sheets, eight in total would you do us this kind favour? Everyone, the warden may get us eight sheets of toilet paper! Good! Your request is reasonable, I'll handle it sir, so what's your answer? Additional funding needs to be approved I'll write in a formal request immediately I'll update you soon come on, warden I've been frank, but you're giving me this official tone it's a serious matter how serious? Sir, I'll handle these day-to-day matters alright, please create a harmonious atmosphere yes, sir Didn't you say the new warden was easy going? I was going around telling everybody that he's by the books, I'm not messing with you that's not difficult officer cheung can buy some toilet rolls with his own money first that works too officer cheung, is that fine with you? What else can I say? Everyone, it'll take time for the warden to get us the toilet paper but that's okay as a good gesture, officer cheung is using his own money and giving us four extra sheets of toilet paper officer cheung! Officer cheung! According to my diagnosis the patient has been in a dark confined space for a long time lacking social interactions, so he has manic depression he'll become very aggressive, and mistrusting to others and he might inflict harm on himself what should we do in this situation? There are three options first, release him back into gen pop let him has normal social interactions second, keep him in solitary confinement we keep him medicated with sedatives to control his emotions and third... We leave him alone, and let him commit suicide Keep him in solitary confinement keep an eye on him make sure he takes his medication in order to control his emotions that's my decision Go and thanks brother scar last card, that's three each, shuffle! Yes! Enjoy - go thanks brother scar - three each thank you, brother scar go thanks brother scar - thank you, brother scar - this was hard to come by don't gamble it away, or else I'll beat you up brother scar, I've distributed it to everyone this is what's left that much?

Not yet, I'll do it now This is a special gift from brother scar you should be thankful if it were me, I'd given you my used toilet paper all done "Ho chun crime: Inciting a murder term: 18 years" Ho chun attacks other prisoner, send him to solitary confinement in prison, don't be too impulsive just don't get into fights, it's trouble for me officer wai I would like a word with tang you're a prisoner, not a visitor get in little wai what is it, warden tang? The toilet is clogged, get someone to fix it the cleaners are off duty, I'll handle it tomorrow just get him to do it Ho chun help the warden unclog the toilet I'll get the tools, but it might take a while three sentences, first one the money I promised you has all been paid already and you have also finished your parts we are squared second one we're in the same situation we're stuck in a place where we don't belong so we should help each other out third one I want you to help me break out of prison interesting... Carry on you were warden here for so many years you must know all the guards here and flaws in the system whichever route to take in order to escape you should know that very well what's in it for me? I believe that we are the same we don't want to stay here I need to get into gen pop but a lot of people want to kill me you need to settle that for me my assets have been frozen I can't bribe anyone anymore it's not always about money as long as your fists hit hard enough and there's big roller and scar they're in our way Betting on Tom yum or biggie? Place your bets I wanna make a bet what are you up to? Boss let you play, who are you betting on? I'm betting on myself You seem pretty loaded, what've you been doing? I told officer cheung that I'd leave you alone, and here you tease me just want some exercise exercise?

Not yet I want to fight you calm down... calm down... Today's leisure time is over this battle of the century will have to be postponed please don't make this difficult for me the warden allows these fights for you guys to let off some steam to build better friendship but he didn't allow gambling with cigarettes sir, I'm not gambling with cigarettes I'm here to give them out for free What's going on? Are you afraid to fight with him? You don't think you'll win? What do you mean I'm afraid? He's been in two fights if I win this fight then I'd have an unfair advantage but if I lose, I'd lose all the respect can't I think about this first? I'm also thinking if he's up to something he's so openly challenging you to a fight you know him he likes to bribe people now he's handing out cigarette? He's probably not up to anything he has no support, and no money he just wants to show off by beating me don't worry, I'll get a few of my guys mess him up few times a day - then he'll back off - don't do that he's challenging you to a fair fight and now you're sneaking up on him you'll lose even more respect like that don't do it let's play again you go first what's up? You're not playing? It's just my two cents, don't be like this you gotta practise more I'm telling my guys to back down so I can still have face that's the right move there was once a new inmate and was at odds with the two biggest prison gangs he was tortured every day, getting beat up he was living in hell but he was resilient and with his wits and his guts and his righteous personality he was able to resolve the hatred between the gangs and was able to plan a prison break but was also able to stop another prison break he's a hero amongst us all some say that he is legendary that person, is me that's impressive mak kin tin yes don't look back, it's unlucky take care, officer cheung also, take care of my brothers don't worry let's go Alright... come in kids, take a look around this is my turf look at all these beds here all of the men sleep right here one bed for each person you can't exchange beds, and you can't share a bed otherwise that's big trouble uncle, what's the big trouble? You'll get it when you're older would you like to try them? Yes then hurry up go ahead and pick a bed, is it comfy? It's not comfy at all uncle, how do you fall asleep on such a hard bed? Smart, that's a good question here you go, take this thank you come around and listen to me for a second alright good do you know why you're here to see these uncomfy beds? I don't know so that you'll remember your beds at home are the most comfy if you don't want to sleep on these hard beds do you remember what you shouldn't do? I know! Do not do bad deeds smart girl, here's some snacks that's yours - I want some too there's plenty for everyone, no need to fight come on - cockroach! - What is it? There's a cockroach don't be afraid... don't be afraid that cockroach is my friend, no need to be afraid smile for me, okay? Good girl alright, let's carry on okay? It's all good, carry on trying to look good? Trying to run? Here you go thank you, sir You deserve this cup of coffee you did very well hosting the school tour the adjudicators were very impressed really? The kids wrote you these letters is that so? How nice You know, you're the best candidate for this activity you were once a triad boss, did some hefty crimes so you setting an example and teaching these kids not to break the law it makes the whole thing more meaningful thank you sir since you're such a nice guy I would like to say something we as inmates are just normal people, we have emotions we always say being hard on us is like pulling a rubber band the backlash would be even more serious organizing these types of activities is a good thing it lightens the mood we were all having a good time it's tiring being the tough guy all the time I agree with you, have a seat that's why I'm allowing boxing matches so that everyone can let off some steam through sport hoping for less unnecessary violence I'm hoping for more reform in the future to add more vocational learning and to enhance stability you're definitely a nice guy sir You're suing the prison you must be the first in history to do so you know protocol, and I know the law I just want to get what I deserve you think you can be transferred to gen pop solely based on this letter? This letter is just the first step I'm going to write to the press claiming that you're abusing your authority holding me without reason how do you think they'll react? I'm putting you here for your safety they'll kill you if you're in gen pop I don't want to rot away here with your authority, they wouldn't dare to touch me warden Attention, deputy warden is here hurry up officer cheung new inmate in block c bed no. 4, bottom bunk yes, sir What is it? I know you all have your quarrels with the former warden but I hope you can remember he is an inmate here now we will treat him as one we would hold back on whoever causes trouble let me go, I'll be the sucker I'd like to welcome you on behalf of block c we all have a chance to redeem ourselves, right? You're letting him out, but you want stability are you messing with yourself, or messing with us? Do you think this is what the warden wants? Tang is suing the prison we don't have a choice I don't know anything do you know what an asshole the former warden was? Letting him out to gen pop like this a lot of people are gonna touch him it's gonna be a shit show what's the point of all this violence? Transferring him to another prison that can really solve the problem but the process takes time and during this time frame what I need is stability it's easy for you to say if anything happens to tang the press is gonna be all over this my plans for reform would go down the drain the warden must have his reasons right? We're all on the same boat like he said, we have to maintain stability we just have to bear with him for now, right? Come on Stop it, why are you hitting him? Didn't scar tell you to back down? He added to my sentence without reason I missed my father's funeral these are the rules, go take a shower how are you doing? Take a hot shower I remember the days without hot water I arranged that request for you guys I wasn't treating you all that badly you've forgotten all the bad stuff? You encouraged scar to gain power added to inmates' sentences without reason this prison was an absolute mess sometimes I feel like you enjoy to see us suffer if you were as tame as you are right now then I wouldn't need scar to balance the power you remember how you got your name, big roller? You would throw people inside the washing machine what a show you're talking to me as if you're the good guy I'm just saying that causing trouble wouldn't be beneficial for any of us It's not your turn yet attention, the warden has an announcement by now, you should all know that I'm trying to reshape the image of this prison so I'm about to introduce a major reform but I'm not able to do it on my own I'll need everyone's help in order to succeed I'll be launching a series of educational courses with only one goal so that you can use your time here to educate yourselves to be able to find a job, and ease yourselves back into society this educational program is mandatory which means everyone needs to participate quiet, the warden is not done yet warden, I have something to say scar I listen to all comments go ahead warden, I'd like to ask I'm here for life would I have a chance to find a job out there? Warden, I'd like to say something we know the benefits of education but in here, what we care the most is actual welfare maybe you can try to motivate us? You're right, I know you're all concerned about food and lodging if you are cooperative on this reform I will hire someone to do pest control and hire a proper catering company sourcing higher quality ingredients so that you can live hygienically and eat healthily also, don't forget if you behave well, I can apply to reduce your sentence so that you can get out sooner, and reunite with your families even though you have a lifetime sentence I can help you apply for parole that's a good deal, we get to learn and have our sentences reduced I'd say yes immediately warden, you come here prepared for the sake of everyone's welfare, I wouldn't object hooray for the warden hooray for the warden What do you think about my plans for reform? Unfortunately, you won't be able to witness it I admit that your presence has caused dissatisfaction among some prisoners for stability I've decided to apply to have you transferred to another prison be patient, it will happen soon enough I've fought in the ring, and you're back in gen pop what's your plan for escape? This place is not that isolated we need a lot of supplies from the outside world there's one thing that gets replenished every day that's food Which is why, as long as we're ready we can leave at any time what do you need me to prepare? I'll arrange how we get on the car you need to deal with whoever gets in our way we need to wait for the right moment to deal with these guys if we're just waiting, then we might as well be more aggressive as soon as possible What do you want? A beating? I want you to be quiet you think you're still the warden? If I don't beat you up today, don't call me tai brother scar wouldn't let us touch him it's because we can't kick his ass that's why he's so arrogant Go away what are you doing? It's none of your business I thought I was being very clear we cannot touch him I never take order from anyone you don't take order? Then I'll get someone to beat you until you do no, boss ho chun stood up for us there's no point hitting a nobody hit me if you have the guts my challenge still stands afraid of losing? You idiot, think you can beat me? You really wanna fight me? Sure then let's up the stakes the loser leaves one hand no problem, that's a deal I've only been gone a while boxing matches? Losing one hand? Is this a martial arts novel? I've warned him before ho chun is up to no good now you've fallen into his trap and you're betting your own hand you guys just didn't see with your own eyes how arrogant ho chun was all eyes were on me if I wasn't fierce, I'd lose my credibility he was able to beat all three of us last time you're going head to head, you're gonna lose worst case, I lose a hand I can survive with one hand I'm afraid that it's more than one hand think about it, he's suddenly the center of attention warden tang is now transferred to gen pop isn't that too much of a coincidence? Words of an educated man then what's his plan? I don't know don't worry we have the new warden and officer cheung they can handle it big roller's words of wisdom from being around long enough why don't you go back in and educate yourself Brother scar, what is this punch? Warming up drink up Scar, a letter for you I have a letter? Yeah. Have you read it? Of course I have you smile so sly You two, get out shut the door Cheun, this is sum you left without a word ten years ago in order for me to forget you I moved abroad with my family but last month I saw news about your prison break then I knew you had a life sentence perhaps you didn't want to keep me waiting you didn't wanna drag me into this, so you disappeared did you want me to move on, or hate you? I wanna know the answer so I've returned to Hong Kong I wanna see you please add me to your list of visitors so that we can talk this out face to face I'll be waiting. Love, sum How should we handle his situation? Keep feeding him sedatives to control his emotions keep an eye on him, make sure he takes his meds that's my decision Ok Hey, are you okay? Eat more, you have a fight later but then again, some people say you shouldn't eat too much before exercising seventy percent then, seventy percent let's eat Is that your girlfriend? Hey, stop it why so lively? What is there to see? What? What's there to see? It's just my fiancee really? Let's take a look wow, she's pretty but not as pretty as my wife you're qualified to say so, brother big roller you're famous for following wife's order keep it well that's called love, you just don't know it yet right... brother big roller is right officer wai is in a bad mood today, just eat You causing trouble? My gangs are here it was an accident then pick it up like a good boy alright sorry about that run along Eat... just eat don't wait brother big roller, here's the menu for next week take a look - I don't need to someone will handle it actually, I better take a look Brother scar, a lot of us betting on you winning we're all supporting you, boss of course, boss was able to win a one against nine fight before sure win be quiet get out of here calm down, if you can't attack, then defend find the right time to throw a big punch if I'm not able to defend myself don't throw in the white towel I don't have much in my life I only have my pride, you know that brother big roller of course, we're brothers, I'm here for you you okay? I'm fine are you not feeling well? Tell me it's okay, just let me finish the fight I'll tell you everything later no worries, my brother go ahead, I can manage Mr. H0 is here early he seems confident he beat me last time with dumb luck our boss is the lead, saving best for last you're right where's scar? Is he stalling so he doesn't have to fight? Don't worry, brother scar will be here You asshole what are you doing hiding in the corner? Don't think that I wouldn't beat your ass calm down that'll just make you feel worse screw you, I'm beating your ass it's just some sedatives, can't die it's like a little nap You were just a nobody when you first came in I gave you the support to become a gang leader then you tried to escape, and I lost my promotion had to stay here I just wanted to earn some quick cash and you guys set me up so I ended up here, living with trash like you at least now, your death will mean something Shit, something happened to brother scar Officer cheung you guys can't go in check the surveillance footage officer cheung, the camera outside the toilet was tampered by somebody who was in charge of this area? Officer cheung, it was me scar was here with his subordinates, preparing the fight scar brother big roller - what happened? - Calm down, we're working on it - brother big roller - just calm down and stay back who was the last to leave? Sorry, sir I was monitoring the fight downstairs so I didn't pay attention however, before I left there was only big roller and scar left in the toilet Search their cells yes, sir Warden, I've found something This knife was found on your bed what do you want? Stand back... Bring both of them to my office Everybody else get back to your cell Who did you think would win, you or scar? No matter what, nobody would die from this you believe that I didn't kill him? I know that a killer wouldn't be stupid enough to put the murder weapon in his own bed were you framed? I don't know I just don't understand why this happened I've checked before the camera outside the toilet was tampered with we saw big roller and scar standing at the door and while the camera was being tampered with another camera caught you elsewhere which means that you have an alibi you also have an alibi you're in the recreation room with a lot of people but the murder weapon was found on your bed what do you have to say about that? Tang is planning a prison break even if I lose, I wouldn't let him win I admit that I encouraged tang to break out he wanted me to damage scar's reputation from the fight but I didn't know he wanted to kill scar and to frame me afterwards so what if scar was killed? Would he be able to break out then? Scar is dead, and we are both in custody nobody will be in his way he knows the kitchen inside out he's also familiar with the food delivery schedule so he can basically leave whenever he wants do you have any proof? The moment he tries to escape will be proof enough tang hon chung My brother Where are you going? To pay my respect you don't have the right big roller, don't cause trouble Without sufficient evidence don't make rash decisions are you done talking? Wing yes, brother big roller keep an eye on this guy twenty four hours got it Warden, we've completed pest control in your office thank you One of the inmates were murdered under our watch this is a very serious mistake I'm not trying to place any blame I just want to know the truth sir, I suggest that we each submit a report detailing everything and everyone we saw during our patrols that day we'll look for clues after we compile them okay, from now on, I'm revoking vacation days we have to amp up security, to avoid this happening again yes, sir any other questions? No, sir scar was tight with a lot of inmates his passing will stir up negative emotion please try to be more tolerant while you're working give them some calm space warden, are you okay? Sir? Warden? Do you have any water? Call an ambulance yes, sir - hurry up warden ma needs to be hospitalized I'll take over as acting warden everyone, remain at your posts maintain order inside the prison yes, sir Alright any belongings? Alright - thank you officer wai back to see your buddies? I have a meeting with officer cheung to collect scar's belongings right, you and scar were close sorry for your loss alright - thank you has the killer been arrested yet? I'm not at Liberty to say maybe you should ask officer cheung thanks There's nobody at corridor c, no need to stand guard go over to gate a for support nobody in or out officer cheung, tang requests to use the toilet rejected, tell him to hold it in he's blabbering on about human rights and that he'd file a complaint against us he's being annoying, can we just let him go? Alright, go with him, keep an eye on him yes, sir let's go My turn? Officer cheung, someone's here for you officer cheung I heard the warden has an accident, is he okay? He was poisoned, and needs to be hospitalized here are scar's belongings thank you, officer cheung here's a letter written by scar's girlfriend scar had a girlfriend? We couldn't get in touch with her though officer cheung, we cannot let scar die in vain don't worry, I'll find out the truth inside these prison walls tang is the only one who hates scar I know, but we need evidence I've read through all of the reports tang had an alibi what if someone wrote a false report? Csd is a part of the disciplined services all prison officers have high integrity and abide by the rule of law tang has been working here for so many years the people around you were all under his wing I wouldn't be surprised if someone was willing to help him Toilet break sir, I wanna use the toilet sure shit what happened? Oh no... Officer cheung, officer pong is unconscious in the toilet officer cheung... tang is disappeared team a, team b, head to the kitchen see if tang is there everybody get down, hands on your head hurry up... hurry up officer cheung, tang is not in the kitchen open the delivery door brother big roller, are you trying to escape again? No, tang might already be inside the deliver truck alright, got it brother big roller says that tang might already be inside the deliver truck open the door now - yes open the door, wait for me Stop the car, open the trunk open the trunk quickly what's happening, sir? Let me do it Officer cheung, he's not inside the trunk officer cheung tang just injured a prison guard, he's trying to escape this proves that ho chun is right tang was the one who killed scar I'm seeking your permission to let the inmates assist with the search so we can find the asshole cannot let scar die in vain this is not a personal request this is a request from all of us that's right, sir all inmates, clear every corner of this prison find me this piece of trash Tang didn't escape through the kitchen are you deliberately creating a diversion to divert our attention? We were all chess pieces in his game, including you There are cameras up front, act normal tang knows nothing about this new warden so once he gets rid of him you'll be the acting warden you've been under his command for years he knows your personality inside out that's beneficial to his escape he would also have guessed that you'll tell us his escape plan in revenge so he's been lying to you all along he used you to spread false information to make us all think that he's escaping through the kitchen but this chess game is not over yet as long as he can't anticipate our next move we'll have a chance to win officer cheung, please let us help to capture him All done, sir sure, I'll buzz you out The door won't open try it again it still doesn't work Wai, what are you doing? Officer cheung, the pest control workers are done I wanted to open the door to let them out but the door won't open, maybe it's malfunctioning? The door is fine, I changed the system I'm the only one with access but they're in a hurry, can we let them out? Under the current circumstances, nobody leaves tell them to wait yes, sir Cheung, it's me you think changing the system would work? You make one wrong move, people will die you can't escape, surrender now three lives are on your hands are you crazy? Stop killing if you don't want me to kill, then open the gate you won't actually open the gate for him, right? We can still catch him if he escapes but we can't bring these people back to life he's just bluffing it's three lives, I can't take the risk if a person is held hostage he wouldn't dare to look the perpetrator in the eye but these pest control workers looked at tang twice as if they're waiting for orders and where did they get the extra uniform? Someone must've arranged it beforehand so the two pest control workers are working together with tang the day when the warden was poisoned the two pest control workers were inside the warden's office if they're working together they must've poisoned him it's not just the two of them wai is highly suspicious as well the area where scar was killed the guard on duty was wai wai was the one who found the murder weapon and the guard in charge of security control was also wai so I wouldn't be surprised if they had guns wai is a senior correctional officer he's always stuck by the rules the day when I had a conversation with tang in solitary was also arranged by wai he must have a solid relationship with tang so the four of them are totally acting we should use this to our advantage I'm opening the gate, but the system takes ten minutes to reboot you must keep the hostages safe within this time hey, I've done all that you asked so please help me pay off the usury hurry when you go out I'm getting married soon, don't drag me into this also, you said that no matter what happened you wouldn't rat me out you must keep your promise it only takes three minutes, why ten minutes? What are you talking about? Are you listening to me? He's stalling for time alert all the officers nearby officer wai is working with the pest control workers to break tang out cease communication with walkie-talkies take everyone back to gen pop stay away from the front entrance suspects are armed I'm raising the alert level to the highest grab your gear from the armory so they're coming to get us? You said they'd comply if we pretended to be hostages what now? They know that you're not a hostage let's try and give him some pressure hey... hey! Look inside - alright nothing keep looking - alright See if he's there? Hey, all prisoners and staff are in the gen pop stop looking, don't run around stop looking... come back it's dangerous out here, lets stay in the gen pop what are you afraid of? No, it's just really dangerous here Sorry, I went the wrong way I'm supposed to go that way... Damn you, I'm seeking revenge for brother scar keep going, don't look speed up speed up Everybody get down You've dragged me into this I borrowed money from a loan shark might get punished worst case is losing my job but what you're doing here I'll end up in prison with you you want to come clean after you got paid? I don't wanna go to prison how about this, you put down the gun and go back to prison and you just go back to on duty we'll pretend nothing happened, we're all happy I'm just saying please, let us go we'll say yes to anything don't hit me... don't hit me uncle seven, how are you doing? Don't move Move faster you talk so much, don't you afraid of death? Let go of uncle seven leave the old man alone, you can have me wing, help uncle seven so that he can breathe I thought you wanted to go out to see your grandkid turns out you just wanna be a hero cheung, I'm holding big roller hostage no matter how many people who you hold hostage I will never compromise let me tell you, I've always been in charge here I want a car within twenty minutes I'll kill one person every minute after that you're weird, people usually want to get out earlier but you choose to make a scene I'm afraid you'll never get out I know that if I open fire in here you'd be lying down when you get out enough, I'll arrange a car He knows our every move, I don't have a choice protecting the hostages is your responsibility it's the right choice to arrange a car for him he knows that you will compromise but he wouldn't expect you to save the hostages? How? They have guns of course we can't just bash in I know the architecture of this prison there is an air duct that connects to the kitchen we can sneak in through there and get the hostages out I have experience crawling inside air ducts but the most important thing is these are all my brothers in there We're surrounded by the SWAT team they're all armed you'll have to blame officer cheung for this Why did he open fire?
