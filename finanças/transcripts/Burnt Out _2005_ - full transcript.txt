Hello! Hello! Is that you, François? François? WITH ALL DUE RESPECT Could you drop me off in town? Could you drop me off? Where? Could you take me to the station? I'm going to Paris. Could you please stop? I have to throw up. Don't stay there. You'll get cold. Thank you. You missed the exit. You're going to Paris? You too? Do you mind? No. Are you always like that? Like what? You're not saying anything. My father ran his family like he ran his business. We were things that needed to be educated. He hated children, but they came with the job. You hate him? I feel sorry for him. He's so lonely. Do you like garlic? Could you stir it, please. Hello! I don't want any excuses. You're not even asking how I got home? Just find yourself a girl who likes the country. I have a bigger one with a view on the backyard. -Would you like to see it? -No, thanks. This one's fine. How long will you stay? -I don't know. -OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't have time to wrap it. Benjamin? Open up! Benjamin. How's school going? Watch out! Benjamin! Benjamin! Benjamin! Did you finish late, yesterday? -Around 10. -Really? What could I do? Missing Benjamin's birthday wasn't enough? Just leave him alone. I have the right to express myself. -OK. -Can't believe it! Simon! He's making fun of us! Simon! What's this all about? Ah, François. Good timing! Could you plug this in? Would you like some coffee? That cord there. Still a non-smoker? I've got some. So, François. What's wrong? Everything's fine. Really? You postponed the ad strategy meeting until the 16th. I thought it could wait. My wife's off that week. We can't wait. We should meet on the 11th. Did Jean show you your new office? What office? Jean. Come with me. Here! What do you think? Nice, hey? Stay here. I have a suggestion. So? It's nice. You don't like it? Ah, come on! Some of your colleagues complained about you. Really? Who? Some. Which ones? It's not important. If your attitude... Right now, I'm eating. What are you doing? It's bullshit. I'm sure nobody complained. Isn't it true? Is it true? What's the matter? -I'm fed up with this company. -It's all bullshit. Mark's right. Get out of there. That guy's crazy. It's not worth getting upset over this. Come on! They're a bunch of buggers. -That's all. -Get out of there. Don't play into his hands. Come on. -Crawl under like the others? -Don't crawl. Just calm down. -Can you calm down? -Calm down? It's all over. I'd like something better for the layout... Never mind. I'll talk to them upstairs. François! He wants to see you. -Who? -You know... Simon! I'll come by later. When? With Clémence? I can't. He wants me to see everyone. I can't. -He wants to see you too. -I don't care. I'm fed up going to meetings that never end... You're fed up... But if you lose your job... Don't cry on my shoulder. You're a jerk. Have a nice evening! -Meat or fish? -Nothing, thanks. -Are you sure? -Got to go. I won't ask for feedback. -Marc? -I don't care. Any preferences? What are the estimates for this year? Fish. Our revenue will be 800,000 euros. That's last year's figure. Unless we canvass other areas, the orders won't go up. What are you waiting for? Santa Claus? Excuse me. Could you pour the oil? -Just a little. -Yes. Very slowly. -On the dough or beside it? -On top. -I don't know... -Of course! Thanks. We won't be able to leave as we planned. They cancelled my vacation. Your vacation? It's OUR vacation. Are you kidding? We rented a month ago. Nothing I can do. Nothing you can do? What are the others doing? Maybe I can join you on weekends. Can't Marc replace you? It's the wrong time to attract attention. What will I tell Benjamin? Can't you take a few days off so the three of us can go away? Hey? I'll see what I can do. -What are you doing? -I'm wiping up. Believe it or not, I don't want to lose you. I don't want to leave. I like my job. I just don't want to spend all my time here. -Sugar? -Sugar. I can't rearrange your schedule. On the other hand... You could work at home to close some files on time... Fine. You'll need a computer and a printer. Working overtime here or at home, it's the same. I'm not talking about overtime. Just rearrange your work schedule. Isn't that what you want? Julie, when will Martine be back from her maternity leave? -End of August. -Thanks. -If it doesn't suit you... -I didn't say that. At least, try it for a while. -He just came up with that? -Yes. Did you accept? He thinks I'll be happy if he supplies a computer. He doesn't know me... -Is it working? -We'll see. How's the work going? Want to eat with us? I can't. Clémence has a meeting. -Nothing. -What? Nothing. It won't start. Let's see now. You hear that, Marie? Listen to how it purrs. It roars. Incredible! -See you later? -Later! -François, see you later. -I can't. We'll just go around the block. -Come, François, -No. It's the weekend. Relax. You're happy. You're happy. Give me a kiss. Pass him on the right. He's scared! Check. Have you seen my car keys? Over there, by the phone. -Have a nice evening. -You too. -Don't stay up too late. -No. You think I'm a rookie? -Go to bed. -The game isn't over. -We'd play all night. -I was winning anyway. Right! Now go! You'll get... my foot... Goodnight! Goodnight! Goodnight! To your health, François! Cheers! Cheers! -To all of you. -To your health! -Come on! -Teamwork. Grin and bear it. -You got a week off? -Tell that to Clémence. What's Simon doing? -Simon! -Santa Claus will be happy. There's nothing in December. Santa Claus... Meat or fish? Any preferences? -Have another glass, François. -The last one. -Did you finish the agreements? -Next week. Don't worry. Hello! Yes. -I'll be going. -I'm coming! -Can I drop you off somewhere? -No. It's too early. -She's married, you know. -Get lost! Leaving now? I'll pick up Benjamin at his judo class. -I'll see you later. -See you later! -See you later! -Just coming in now? Happiness, good health... and plenty of joy. Need some joy, Jean? Unfortunately. Not me. I'm... Are we going to your place first? -I'm coming. -There! It's not fair. Not fair. I prefer to leave. It's better this way. It's wrong to fire people like that, Simon. I wonder... -Maybe we could... -What the hell for? What happened, Simon? If they ask you tonight, just tell them... I don't feel like going. We could go and get a drink, the two of us. No, thanks. I have to gather my stuff. I'll go. -Julie. -Yes? -Thank you. -What for? Bruner's restructuring the company. -He's the manager... -Really? Excuse me. -May I borrow him? -Good evening. I'll introduce you to our new sales manager. No. I'll be fine. Good evening. This is the François I told you about. Nice to meet you. -Good evening. -Good evening. I'm glad to meet you. It's the first time we meet. -Mr. Bruner told me about you. -When do you start? Tomorrow. I can't wait. I'm anxious to start. Me too. It's his fault. Can't blame anyone but himself. -What do you mean? -Couldn't keep his mouth shut. -Simon never tried to adapt. -Adapt to what? Just adapt. -That's no reason to fire him. -Yes, it is. -Does François know? Nobody knows. I just found out. If we choose fair pay instead of equal pay and expect employees to be loyal, we'll reclaim our profits. -Marc. Have you seen Simon? -Some will wonder why... -No. -To them I would reply... that I have another goal. You're all working toward that goal. The final phase of our recovery plan will allow us to share our profits with each of you. We're entering the month of September with a slim figure and a tremendous appetite. I wish you all the best. Have a nice evening! -Here! To your contracts! -Clémence. To extra cash! -Simon's not here yet? -Have you seen him? -No. -Your friend's not coming. He was just fired. Flora. -What got into you? -I couldn't help it. The battle's not over. They made all the decisions. -You created havoc. -I had to tell them. -No, but... -What? He was fired. Know what that means? Nothing we can do about it. Marie? It's François. Is Simon there? No, it's OK. Goodnight. There's no one there. Who are... I don't understand his version... What's he doing? Right over there. That's closed too. The lights are on. Park there. I don't know. He must have gone home. -Did you call the police? -No. What are you waiting for? Shit! It's Simon? Come! Let's get a coffee. François, don't stay there. François! François! Marie? Marie? Marie? Marie? How's Marie doing? Want me to cancel that dinner? -This meat looks great. -Thanks. -Yes. It looks perfect. -Here! -François? -Rare? It's getting difficult to buy good meat, with flavor. It's all the same. Mad cow disease spoiled everything. It's a thing of the past. They made up a story. That's all. It's delicious. -Can't change a whole country. -It's all over, now. -Why would it be over? -It's clear that it's over. François. -You're exaggerating. -This meat is delicious. -Mine's a little overcooked. -No vegetables for me? I'm sorry. I forgot you. It's true you're on a diet. Yes, you look slimmer. I lost two kilos. If you're not careful, when you reach 40, you... -If you're sitting at a desk... -Let's not exaggerate. -Is this enough? -Yes, enough. It's like having your car checked at the garage. Same for our body. -It's mental. -It's physical. This is a real treat. You're not eating? -What's this crap about? -What are you talking about? You had to cover that story, not create havoc. -Just doing my job. -You're replacing Arnaud. Everyone knew. Where's the problem? -That guy committed suicide. -Damn! Where are you going? Good evening. I found this among Simon's things. You should rest, François. What exactly did he say, that night? I told you. I don't know any more than you do. Is Bruner in? There's a board meeting until 10:30 PM. Hello! I'm Flora... -Is your husband home? -No. -It's about Simon Lacaze. -I know... Please ask him to call me. He can reach me at home this evening. -I'll tell him. -Thank you. -If you're going out... -Of course. -Take a car, for example. -...difference at the gas pump. For the same distance, an ordinary car and a diesel car... the diesel costs less to run. What's your car? Not eating your dessert? It took your appetite away? For you, it's Christmas. All you need is the fir tree. François! Doesn't matter: one more, one less... Stop, François! What makes you react? Raw meat? I didn't say anything. -Shut up! -What could we do? It's not about doing. It's about caring. -Simon was your friend, too. -He wasn't in his right mind. Shut your mouth! You're the sick one! Simon's sick. Simon's what? Anything else? You're not saying anything. Bunch of cowards! You're well paid for those four hours. -Damn fool! -Shit! You're a piece of shit! I won't even step on you. Enjoy your meal! -You're the sick one. -Shut up! Shut your mouth! He pisses me off! Madam! More, please. Thank you. DEATH WITHOUT WARNING DSBO employee found dead... DEATH WITHOUT WARNING DSBO employee found dead... What happened, François? Nothing happened. Marc phoned. I resigned. -You what? -I resigned. Were you fired? Tell me what's wrong. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. He can't come back. Don't make yourself sick over that. That? Simon's death? You're not responsible for his death. You had no way of knowing. I should have known. No. Simon was unpredictable. He was right. I've always been afraid of everything. What? It's true. I've always been afraid of you, too. François! -I want to talk to you. Get out! -Who's that? Get out of the car! Get out! I want to talk to you. -Get going! Just go! -You're not getting out... You're a... Scotch, no ice. Two more. -Here! -Thanks. -May I use the phone? -Yes. There, by the washroom. This is a coffeepot. There are stars, a heart... Hello! Is that you, François? Could you drop me off in town? Could you drop me off? Bruner had an accident. He's dead. The driver's in the hospital. -Who's that? -The police. What time did your husband go out, last night? I told you. I don't know. Mrs. Durrieux, please let us do our job. I know it's not easy. If your husband's innocent, why did he flee? He didn't flee. I reported him missing this morning. Something must've happened. Please, don't... Is this your husband's phone. His portable phone. Was he seeing people you don't know? Was he seeing people you don't know, Mrs. Durrieux. I don't know. -You don't need those things. -Mrs. Durrieux, please! Hello! Is it you, dad? Where are you? François? Answer me. Where are you? François? I've done something wrong. Don't let us down. I didn't plan it that way. François... Are you still there? Hello! Mr. Durrieux? What are you doing here? -Benjamin, are you crazy? -You have the wrong enemy. It's none of your business. -I just want... -Get out! I don't want people to tell all kinds of stories. François's not violent. I'm not responsible for what others write. I don't know what was going on in his mind. That night, he was a different man. I tried to calm him down, but... When he looked up at me, I got scared. That's when I realized he was fighting a battle. Do you know where he went? No. The truck stop manager saw you with Durrieux. How is that his business? I don't even know his name. Remember or I'll find proof. I don't know him. What can I say? -What did he say? -Nothing. He seemed completely lost. Why would I lie? I don't know that François... François Durrieux. With that attitude, Lisa, sooner or later... you'll get in serious trouble. Laugh all you want... Last time they picked you up for theft, they gave you a chance. Next time, they'll book you. -Can I go? -Yea. What are you doing here? The police came to see me, this morning. -Don't believe what you hear. -I never believe anyone. -I didn't kill anyone. -But they're looking for you. You never say anything. I love you so much! You didn't sign my notebook. Oh, yes. About your dad... Don't worry about that. He'll come back. Understand? Now, hurry up or you'll be late. Get going! I can't let them say such things. -Nobody cares. People... -I don't care about them. I want my son to know the truth. What truth? Nobody'll believe you. You can't understand. I wanted to give this back to you. Don't bug me! I said in five minutes. It's me. Where are you? I wasn't taking my revenge. That's bullshit! I wanted them to explain their conduct, to say they're sorry. Bruner was the only one who knew. You can't just ruin everything. The last time I saw him, he was all right. What happened the night of the accident? I tried to stop their car. I wasn't asking much. They didn't understand. I don't know what got into me. I just wanted to scare them. It's ridiculous. Just scare them: that's all I wanted. After... Simon's death... I went back to work. At least I tried. I thought I'd feel better after a while, but... no. The others were okay, but... I wasn't okay. I went to see Bruner cause I thought he would explain. Whether you wanted it or not, someone died. The police won't give up. Two people died. Simon was like a brother to me. I just wanted to talk to them, to understand... What would you have done? Don't answer. Unless you surrender, no one will understand. -It's too late, now. -Wrong! Surrender, or you'll never know why he was fired. Don't tell me what to do or not to do. -That's not why I came. -Then why did you come? You called me. So I stole a wallet... I don't care about the judge. -Don't provoke me. -What do you care? Get lost! I came to thank you. What for? The police... the other day. -Want me to go? -No, stay. -Are you done already? -Yes. -Show me. -Here. Think they'll approve? Where were you? We've been looking for you all day. At the brothel. Here! -How did you do it? -He phoned me. Sure about this? I'm not sure about anything. But I believe him. For God's sake! There's an ongoing investigation. We can't publish this. We don't have enough facts. What more do you want? -Don't forget someone died. -Two died. Don't you want to know why? It's too soon. I can't publish it. I'll find you some facts! You're pissing me off! Management asked us not to talk about it. No one knows why he was fired. They wanted to for months. Must have found a reason. Simon griped. He wasn't happy here. He should have kept his mouth shut. -Nobody asked? -Ask what? Not our business! Bury your head in the sand and your ass will stick out. We should fight against whom? Against what? -Don't be an idiot! -Only sick people act like that. Would you shoot yourself if you got fired? Who knows? Who knows? More of the same, please. What did you expect? I trusted her. Why would she publish that? Unless she wants a scoop? Wake up! Nobody cares about your friend's death. When are you gonna understand? You want people to know the truth? Lay low for a few days. If you surrender, they won't give you a change to explain. I can get fake ID for you. What are these letters about? Last year, Simon hurt his leg. They didn't admit it was a job-related accident. Simon pressured them into paying. It's old stuff. You can't fire someone for this. I don't understand why they fired him. I don't know. Simon wasn't easy to get along with. That's for sure. In the past few months, he was very nice. I think things were good. -What did they tell you when... -Nothing. They called and said that my husband had had an accident. An accident. They didn't even come to his funeral. An accident. They didn't even come to his funeral. Hello! Mrs. who? I'll speak to her. Hello? Could you come to my office? Wherever you want. Fine. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. -I don't have any choice. -There's always a choice. You can't give up now. They won't give you a chance to explain. Understand? Think about your son. I'll be downstairs in five minutes. -Hello! -I'm Flora Lebrun. I read your article about Simon Lacaze. What is it? I found that among Bruner's papers. At Dominique Bruner's request... and in the best interests of DSBO, ...about this request, I went to Simon Lacaze's home. Nobody knows. Except, maybe President Lunel. What's this all about? Where can I reach you? -I resigned. -You're leaving? Nice to see you. Alex, meet my friend. It's OK. Lisa told me the story. Aren't you seeing the judge today? Don't bug me about that. -Are you OK, dear? -I'm fine. Smells good. What's cooking? Some jam. We have time... -Is he your new boyfriend? -No. I'll put this in the kitchen. I'll wait outside. When will it be ready? I hope you know what you're doing. It's OK. Is tonight OK? Shit! Someone's following me. You can't stay with me. Let me off. I don't care about those papers. If they catch us, there's no way out. I'll manage. Let's meet at Lyon Station, by the photo booth. -Get out now. Get out! -I can't. Get out! Shit! Police! Ah, shit! -Hello, madam. -Thank you for seeing me. Follow me, please. Why would he have done that? I'm not the one who could answer that. We couldn't pass up on such a story. -Bruner was just doing his job. -You didn't tell his wife? It's difficult to talk about that. Bruner chose not to say anything. He didn't know Lacaze would react that way. I won't repeat this offer. Tell me where you're supposed to meet him, or you're done. Hiding a criminal. Want me to read you the criminal code? You know how to read? I don't understand. You're an intelligent girl, Lisa. That's why. -Why what? -Why you don't understand. You enjoy that. You go right when you're told to go left. You don't want a better life? I've tried everything. Even acupuncture. You'll have time to try something more efficient. Find something interesting. You're in for a long time. Book her! I'll call the judge. Get out of here! Schmuck! -Where's Lisa? -Things went bad. They got Lisa. Are you deaf? Get lost! I don't want to see you anymore. -When? -Here! -When? -Take the damn papers. Go away, now. Go! -Hello! -It's François Durrieux. -You betrayed me. -I didn't betray you. I trusted you. You should have published that article. Your friend made a serious mistake. -What mistake? -He stole some equipment. -A portable computer, a printer. -What are you talking about? I have the report right here. Hello? Simon didn't steal anything. Bruner give him that equipment so he could work from home. That's what he said. Maybe it wasn't true. How can you think that? Why didn't he defend himself? Hey, sir! Hurry up! It's so funny. We'll take you where you can rest. -You have to help us. -Get up. -Get up. Up! One, two, three. Come on! Put your feet in front of you. One foot... There! Let's go! Come on! Stand on your feet, sir. Hello! How is he? Mom? Hi, François. I brought you this. I'll get you a lawyer. You'll be all right. Last night, after you left... They reversed the picture. -It's not... -But still... They picked up Durrieux. You're going to lay off more than a hundred people. We don't have any choice. -Some won't find another job. -It's hard for everyone. -What about François Durrieux? -Justice will be done. -What's your opinion? -Please! Please! Please! Flora! -How are you? -I'm OK. -I was a bit... -I know. Take care of yourself. I mussed your hair. What are you doing? Gimme! It's mine. -Gimme... -Calm down. Easy! Go to hell! I'm cool. I'm cool. It's cool. Could you give this to my son? He'll understand. Thank you. Dear Benjamin, I received your letter. I'm glad to hear you're fine. I know it's not so easy for you at times. Then, just think about something that made you happy. My voice will be there with you. Don't be afraid anymore. My voice will be there with you. Don't be afraid anymore. What should I do?
